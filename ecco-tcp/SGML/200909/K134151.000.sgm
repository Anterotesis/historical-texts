<HEAD>PREFACE, ADDRESSED TO <HI>JOHN SARGENT,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Member of Parliament, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS the following Di&s;&s;ertations owe their birth to your judicious choice of the &s;ubject, and liberal encouragement of it, they now naturally wait upon you for your protection and countenance. Your original de&s;ign having been only to excite a noble emulation among the youth of an infant Seminary, in a remote part of the world, and to turn their early attention to a matter of very high and national importance, you will not look for any thing in the execution beyond their years, their experience, or opportunities of information.</P>
<P>YOUR known candor will likewi&s;e lead you to con&s;ider the peculiar difficulties, ari&s;ing from the times and circum&s;tances, in which the&s;e pieces were compo&s;ed. An act of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament had become the
<PB N="ii" REF="11">fatal cau&s;e of an unhappy breach of that UNION which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted (and ever ought to &s;ub&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">) between the Colonies and the mother country; and very general were the agitations and unea&s;ine&s;s thereby produced on this &s;ide of the <HI>Atlantic.</HI> Even hoary age, and men of the mo&s;t &s;ubdued pa&s;&s;ions among us, admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting the mo&s;t plenary juri&s;diction of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, could not, in this par|ticular ca&s;e, but con&s;ider their conduct as at lea&s;t unkind to their <HI>American</HI> fellow &s;ubjects, in de&s;iring (without any pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity that appeared to us) to come between us and our Sovereign, and to lay a foundation which might ea&s;ily have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en drawn into a prece|dent for depriving us of all future oppor|tunities of te&s;tifying our loyalty, by the free and voluntary grant of our own money.</P>
<P>If, then, &s;uch was the light in which the <HI>cool</HI> and the <HI>aged</HI> con&s;idered this matter, ex|pre&s;&s;ions of a warmer and more unguarded kind might have dropt from the pens of youth! Yet no &s;uch thing appears in the following Di&s;&s;ertations, which are laid before the public in the genuine form and dre&s;s wherein they were pre&s;ented by their authors.
<PB N="iii" REF="12">Nor was it po&s;&s;ible that the &s;malle&s;t additions or alterations could be made con&s;i&s;tent with the plan pur&s;ued in the execution of your tru&s;t; which plan you ought to have an account of, and it may al&s;o be of u&s;e to pre&s;erve it here, by way of precedent for future occa&s;ions of the like kind.</P>
<P>SEVERAL con&s;iderations having prevented the Tru&s;tees of the College from propo&s;ing your MEDALS to be contended for by the youth, the fir&s;t year after the receipt of them; they were at la&s;t propo&s;ed, by an adver|ti&s;ement as follows, viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>College of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 6, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS John Sargent, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> mer|chant in London, and member of Par|liament, hath pre&s;ented to this College a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Only &s;o much of the adverti&s;ement is here in&s;erted as relates to the di&s;po&s;ition of the Medal, which produced the following E&s;&s;ays; Mr. Sargent's other Medal not being yet di&s;po&s;ed of.</NOTE> GOLD MEDAL, for the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> e&s;&s;ay <HI>on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual</HI> UNION <HI>between</HI> Great-Britain <HI>and her</HI> Ame|rican <HI>Colonies.</HI>&mdash; Notice is hereby given, by order of the Tru&s;tees, that the &s;aid <HI>Medal</HI> will be di&s;po&s;ed of at the en&s;uing
<PB N="iv" REF="13">commencement in <HI>May,</HI> for the be&s;t e&s;&s;ay that &s;hall be produced on the &s;ubject pro|po&s;ed, by any of tho&s;e who have received any degree, or part of their education in this College&mdash;And as the &s;aid &s;ubject is one of the mo&s;t important which can at this time employ the pen of the <HI>patriot</HI> or <HI>&s;cholar,</HI> and is thus left open to all tho&s;e who have had any connection with this College, either as &s;tudents or graduates, it is hoped, for the honour of the Seminary, as well as their own, they will nobly exert them&s;elves on a &s;ubject &s;o truly animating, which may be treated in a manner alike intere&s;ting to good men, both here and in the mother country.</P>
<P>Each candidate is de&s;ired to prefix a motto, and a mark or device to his per|formance, and &s;eal it up, without his name, in a &s;eparate cover. He is then to put his name under another &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aled cover, writing on the out&s;ide of this cover the &s;ame motto and mark or device, which he has prefixed to his performance.</P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t impartiality will be ob|&s;erved by the Tru&s;tees and Profe&s;&s;ors in
<PB N="v" REF="14">examining the &s;everal performances, with|out opening any of the covers that contain the names, till it is fir&s;t determined which of the performances is entitled to the Medal, and then only that cover will be opened on which the motto is written that directs to the name of the per&s;on entitled to the prize, which &s;hall be given in pub|lic at the en&s;uing commencement; and therefore the &s;everal candidates are de&s;ired to &s;end their compo&s;itions and names &s;ealed and covered as afore&s;aid, to the Provo&s;t, on or before the 8th day of <HI>May.</HI>&mdash;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>ON the 8th day of <HI>May</HI> accordingly nine different performances were produced, on a careful peru&s;al of which, the three im|mediately following were laid a&s;ide for a &s;e|cond reading; after which the Medal was unan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mou&s;ly decreed to the fir&s;t. The &s;econd al&s;o was judged a ma&s;terly, judicious and &s;en&s;ible performance, worthy of a Medal al&s;o, if there had been another for the &s;ame &s;ubject; and the third was likewi&s;e greatly approved of as a &s;pirited performance, &s;o far as it went; and it was agreed that the pub|lication of both, together with the prize-piece,
<PB N="vi" REF="15">would be of &s;ervice at this cri&s;is; which determination was immediately in&s;erted in the public papers; in pur&s;uance whereof the mode&s;t and ingenious youth, who is author of the &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation, gave leave to pub|li&s;h it with his name. The author of the third Di&s;&s;ertation, wrote, concerning his piece, that he <Q>had but two days to &s;pare, from a particular hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s in his profe&s;&s;ion, to prepare it in; and that &s;o far from thinking it di&s;graced by being the third be&s;t, he would have rejoiced, for the honor of the Seminary in which he received his fir&s;t education, if all the other &s;ix had been &s;uperior al&s;o; and that if there were any ob&s;ervations in it which had not oc|curred to the other gentlemen, or were likely to &s;erve as hints for abler pens to &s;et &s;o important a &s;ubject in a proper light, he readily con&s;ented to its publication; but reque&s;ted, for particular rea&s;ons, that his name might not be annexed to it.</Q></P>
<P>THE fourth little piece is the production of an ingenious &s;on of the college, in his own ea&s;y unpremeditated way. He has by many compo&s;itions done honor to the place of his
<PB N="vii" REF="16">education; and by this, which was only the &s;udden work of a few hours of that day, in which the other pieces were under exami|nation, he meant not to come in compe|tition for the prize, but only to throw his mite into the general &s;tock. After his de|parture to <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome of his friends having de&s;ired it to be publi&s;hed, with the three fir&s;t pieces, it was accordingly annexed; and had any of the authors of the other five remaining pieces, or their friends, made the like reque&s;t, they would have been indulged in it. Indeed mo&s;t of them would have well de&s;erved to be laid before the pub|lic, had we not been afraid that the repetition of many of the &s;ame &s;entiments, which mu&s;t unavoidably run through them all, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, would at length become tire|&s;ome to the reader.</P>
<P>WE have only now to mention the oc|ca&s;ion of the following Eulogium. By your own propo&s;al, as well as by order of the Tru&s;tees of the College, the Medal was to be conferred at a public commencement, Wherefore, at the commencement, <HI>May</HI> 20th, 1766, immediately after the valedic|tory

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the reward of your great merit in this elegant performance, I am, in the name of the Tru&s;tees and Faculty of this College, as well as in behalf of the worthy Donor, to beg your acceptance of this GOLD MEDAL&mdash;Its intrin&s;ic value may not be an object of much con&s;ideration to you; but the truly honourable circum|&s;tances, by which it now becomes yours, mu&s;t render it one of the mo&s;t valuable jewels in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="19">ADORNED tho' you have been with honors in di&s;tant lands, yet we tru&s;t tho&s;e will not be the lea&s;t acceptable to you, which your native country be&s;tows.</P>
<P>THAT the fir&s;t literary prize, contended for in this In&s;titution, &s;hould fall to the &s;hare of one of its elde&s;t &s;ons, who, to much genius and application, has joined much knowledge of the world, will not &s;eem &s;trange. Yet &s;till, for the honor of the Seminary, and what will not derogate from your honor, it will appear that you have obtained this pre-eminence over no mean competitors.</P>
<P>SOME of our younger &s;ons (among whom we ought not to omit the name of the mode&s;t and candid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the &s;econd of the following Di&s;&s;ertations.</NOTE> WATTS, with &s;ome others even of inferior &s;tanding) have exhibited &s;uch vi|gorous efforts of genius, and tread &s;o ar|dently on the heels of you and others their &s;eniors, that it will require the utmo&s;t ex|ertion of all your faculties, the continual &s;training of every nerve, if you would long wi&s;h to lead the way to them, in the great career of Fame.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="20">O NOBLE conte&s;t! O happy &s;eat of Science! to behold &s;uch a divine emulation among thy &s;ons, kindled by the ardent de&s;ire of glory, and &s;upported on tho&s;e liberal principles which true Literature alone can in&s;pire!</P>
<P>MUCH do we owe to you, Gentlemen, on this occa&s;ion, much every way&mdash; much for the pains you have taken to do honor to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of your education; and much for the public te&s;timony you have given in its favor, declaring that <HI>here</HI> you have imbibed the true principles of Liberty, and have learned from your <Q>early<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Morgan's Di&s;&s;ertation, who was one of the fir&s;t graduates.</NOTE> youth that your head, your heart and your hand &s;hould ever be at the &s;ervice of your country</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>TRUE it is, Gentlemen, that we have pub|lickly inculcated&mdash;and it was our duty to inculcate, on you, <Q>that<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e quotations are from a charge delivered by the author of this Eulogium, to the fir&s;t cla&s;s of gra|duates in the College of Philadelphia, May 17th, 1757.

<P>WE have exhorted you, <Q>when your country calls, to be all eye and ear and heart and voice and hand, in a cau&s;e &s;o glorious; proceeding with a manly and intrepid &s;pirit, with a fervent and en|lightened zeal; fearle&s;s of danger, un|daunted by oppo&s;ition, and convincing the world that Liberty is your unconquer|able delight, and that you are &s;worn foes to every &s;pecies of bondage either of body or of mind.</Q></P>
<P>BUT however much it might have been our duty to deliver le&s;&s;ons of this kind, &s;mall would have been the honour we &s;hould have derived from them, if you, Gentlemen had not nobly called tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons forth into Action, demon&s;trating by your <HI>living</HI> example, that the education you received in this place,
<PB N="5" REF="22"><Q>was not a mere art of furni&s;hing the Head, but a true di&s;cipline of the Life and Manners.</Q></P>
<P>TRULY delicate and difficult, we confe&s;s was the &s;ubject pre&s;cribed to you&mdash;to treat of <Q>the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual UNION between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>American</HI> Colonies,</Q> at a time when a fatal Mi&s;under&s;tanding had untwi&s;ted all the cords of that UNION, and the minds of many were too much inflamed. This difficulty was likewi&s;e encrea&s;ed to us by other con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P><HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who, by her liberality, had rai&s;ed this College from a helple&s;s to a flou|ri&s;hing &s;tate, had an undoubted demand on us, in our particular capacity, for all the re|turns of gratitude. Yet we could not, we dur&s;t not, divert the &s;treams of Learning from their &s;acred cour&s;e. Our country, nay all <HI>America,</HI> had a right to demand that tho&s;e &s;treams &s;hould be directed pure along, to water the goodly TREE OF LIBERTY, nor ever be &s;uffered to cheri&s;h any foul weed, that would choak its growth.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="23">IN this mo&s;t difficult conjuncture, we re|joice to behold you, in your early youth, exerci&s;ing all the temper and prudence of the mo&s;t experienced Patriots; freely and duti|fully acknowledging in behalf of the mother country, that, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Di&s;&s;ertation third.</NOTE> as the de&s;ign of colonizing, was not to found a <HI>new</HI> empire, but to ex|tend the <HI>old,</HI> the Colonies owe obedience under all con&s;titutional and legal re&s;tric|tions, and a due &s;ubordination in all com|mercial purpo&s;es;</Q> yet firmly a&s;&s;erting in behalf of the Colonies that they <Q>are entitled, in return, to the full and free enjoyment of BRITISH LIBERTY, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary protection from all external violence &mdash;and that a policy which would en&s;ure a &s;mall immediate revenue, at the expence of a great, though indirect, national gain, is <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>&s;ordid,</HI> unworthy of the gene|rous enterprizing &s;pirit of a commercial nation;</Q> and radically de&s;tructive of the mutual confidence.</P>
<P>WE rejoice that ever we had the lea&s;t &s;hare in forming &s;entiments like the&s;e, which have led you to draw the true line, and power|fully
<PB N="7" REF="24">to &s;hew that on the everla&s;ting ba&s;is of <HI>reciprocal Intere&s;t,</HI> and a participation of <HI>con|&s;titutional priv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leges,</HI> and on this alone, our UNION &s;hall be perpetuated, and <Q>our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Mr. WATTS's Di&s;&s;ertation.</NOTE> bleeding wounds healed up, without &s;o much as a &s;car by way of remembrance.</Q></P>

<P>THE occa&s;ion now calls me to addre&s;s a few things to you, Gentlemen, who have ju&s;t received your degrees in this Seminary; but I would not tre&s;pa&s;s on the patience of this candid audience.</P>
<P>YOU have ob&s;erved the honors to which li|terary merit, and integrity of principles, have already advanced tho&s;e who have gone be|fore you in their &s;tudies here; and you can|not but be &s;en&s;ible, that of all the glories reflected on this In&s;titution, we judge tho&s;e the mo&s;t &s;olid and tran&s;porting which we derive from our own &s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="25">THE time is fa&s;t approaching, and I tru&s;t your bo&s;oms now glow for it, when you too &s;hall, in your turn, have an opportunity of doing honour to your education, by your conduct in public life. When that time &s;hall come, educated as you have been in the prin|ciples of &s;ound Liberty, permit us to pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves, that you will ever think it your glory, to be enli&s;ted under her banners, and to follow her exalted call.</P>
<P>WHAT we have often given in &s;olemn charge to tho&s;e who have gone before you, and what you have often heard delivered in the cour&s;e of your &s;tudies here, is, I hope, engraven on your memories, and need not now be re|peated.</P>
<P>YOU will con&s;ider all arts, all &s;ciences, all eloquence, all philo&s;ophy, as intended to di&s;|cipline the &s;oul for eternity, and &s;o far as they center not ultimately in this grand view, they are at be&s;t but empty trifles. Always look on the &s;criptures of God as that ma&s;ter &s;y&s;tem of knowledge, by which all other wi&s;dom is to be regulated and perfected.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="26">IN whatever &s;tation of life you are, we hope you never will forget your obligations to this &s;eminary, which will travail, as it were in pain for you, till you appear on the the|atre of action with dignity; and will expect to find its own children and &s;ons, at lea&s;t, among the number of its friends&mdash; We wi&s;h you every felicity, and bid you farewell.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND here I ought to conclude&mdash;But the joyous occa&s;ion calls me to return particular thanks to this &s;plendid audience for the coun|tenance they have given us this day; and to congra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulate them on the glorious and happy turn in the affairs of <HI>America,</HI> whereof ye&s;ter|day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The account of the repeal of the <HI>American</HI> &s;tamp|act was received at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the day before the de|livery of this Elogium, viz. May 19, 1766.</NOTE> gave us the certain and confirmed accounts.</P>
<P>WHEN I look back on the dreadful &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, in which the&s;e Colonies have been &s;o long agitated; when, in the room of foreboding doubt and painful &s;ollicitude, I behold joy in every look, the clouds di&s;per&s;|ed, the &s;un breaking in upon us again, and
<PB N="10" REF="27">an a&s;&s;embly around me in which every man, rejoices to &s;alute his neighbour as Free &mdash;I <HI>Feel,</HI> I <HI>Feel,</HI> a &s;ympathy unutter|able, and an exultation of &s;oul never felt before!</P>
<P>O GLORIOUS day! O happy <HI>America!</HI> if now we but know how to prize our happine&s;s&mdash; The unguarded &s;allies of intemperate zeal will &s;oon be forgotten; but the &s;tedfa&s;t, the noble, the patriotic efforts of cool and good men, in the vindication of native and con&s;ti|tutional rights, will more and more claim the regard of all the Free, in every clime and age; and perhaps be con&s;ecrated by time into one of the brighte&s;t tran&s;actions of our &s;tory; a&s;&s;erting our pedigree, and &s;hewing that we were worthy of having been de&s;cended from the illu&s;trious &s;tock of <HI>Britons!</HI></P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of Liberty, Civil and Religious, is the cau&s;e of <HI>Britain</HI> her&s;elf&mdash;nay it is the cau&s;e of heaven; and it was with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction that I beheld more than one of the gentlemen, who have written on the ties of UNION between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her co|lonies, deriving a very capital argument from the ties of a Common Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="28">WHEN I review the hi&s;tory of the world, and look on the progre&s;s of Knowledge, Free|dom, Arts and Sciences, I cannot but be &s;trongly per&s;uaded that Heaven has yet glo|rious purpo&s;es to &s;erve thro' <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>CIVIL Liberty, the Prote&s;tant Religion, the principles of Toleration, in their purity, ho|norable as they are to human nature, &s;ub&s;i&s;t but in few places of the globe; and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is their principal re&s;idence.</P>
<P>UNDER her au&s;pices they were tran&s;planted into <HI>America;</HI> where they have got firm root, and are flouri&s;hing into immen&s;e growth and will bring &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength to the general cau&s;e of Liberty and Pro|te&s;tanti&s;m, that we tru&s;t no power on earth &s;hall ever be able to prevail again&s;t their united &s;trength.</P>
<P>THIS &s;entiment, it is hoped, will more and more gain ground among good men both here and in the mother country; convincing them that to check the &s;pirit of Freedom, or di&s;courage the propagation of knowledge here in <HI>America,</HI> would, on the part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="29">be to wound her own members, and weaken or de&s;troy that glorious public &s;y&s;tem of Truth, Freedom and Happine&s;s, whereof &s;he is the Guardian and the head!</P>
<P>ANIMATED by the&s;e principles, and guided by an enlightened zeal, it will become us to manife&s;t our gratitude and love to the mo|ther country, by every means in our power. Let us make our moderation known to all the world; bending our whole thoughts to a virtuous indu&s;try, beneficial to our&s;elves and to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> acting <Q>as Free, but not u&s;ing our liberty as a cloak of malicious|ne&s;s</Q> or of Licentiou&s;sne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION I. On the reciprocal ADVANTAGES OF A PERPETUAL UNION BETWEEN <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN</HI> AND Her <HI>AMERICAN</HI> COLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>_NEVER hath the cau&s;e of Liberty employed the pen of any of her votaries upon a &s;ubject of greater importance to <HI>Britain</HI> and her Co|lonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction.</NOTE> than the <HI>reciprocal advantages</HI> of which a perpetual UNION between them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be productive. To inve&s;tigate the&s;e advantages, and to place them in a clear and con&s;picuous point of view, requires much &s;kill and ingenuity, and affords ample &s;cope for a vigorous exertion of the brighte&s;t genius, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and improved by the mo&s;t exten&s;ive literature. A competent knowledge of the great and fundamental principles of govern|ment,
<PB N="2" REF="33">of the nature of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, the particular rights and privileges of the &s;everal Colonies, together with the hi&s;tory of their produce, trade and commerce, is indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P>UNEQUAL as I am to the arduous ta&s;k,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives for this undertak|ing.</NOTE> and trembling, le&s;t the &s;ubject &s;hould &s;uffer under my unpracti&s;ed hand, I have been almo&s;t tempted to decline it; but when I con&s;ider my&s;elf at once as a <HI>Briton</HI> and an <HI>American,</HI> and reflect upon the invaluable privileges and benefits, to which, in both the&s;e characters and capacities, I am &s;o happy as to be en|tituled, every apprehen&s;ion vani&s;hes; an ho|ne&s;t confidence takes place, and I venture to deliver my &s;entiments, rude and unpoli&s;hed as they are, upon this intere&s;ting theme, depending for &s;ucce&s;s upon that love of li|berty, and that warm zeal for my country's welfare, with which my bo&s;om does, and, I tru&s;t, will always glow. 'Tis this alone gives me rea&s;on to hope for that candour from my dear countrymen, to which I am well con|vinced my poor abilities can lay no claim.</P>
<P>BUT I have an additional incentive to this undertaking: for I am called to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Further mo|tive.</NOTE> as the &s;on
<PB N="3" REF="34">of an In&s;titution, wherein I imbibed the true principles of Liberty, and was taught to ad|mire the beauty and excellency of that civil con&s;titution, in which the governing powers mutually controul, and are controuled by each other, in which the rights of prince and people are accurately di&s;criminated, and li|berty and property effectually &s;ecured by a government of laws, not of men; in which civil and religious rights and privileges are held &s;acred and inviolable, and declared to be no le&s;s the birth-right of the meane&s;t &s;ubject, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant and ob&s;cure corner of the realm, than of the highe&s;t courtier that ba&s;ks in the &s;un-&s;hine of royal favour.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Briti&s;h American</HI> &s;eminary, which was founded upon the&s;e principles, and is careful to tran&s;mit them pure and uncorrupted to all her children, is ju&s;tly intituled to a greater tribute from me than I have it in my power to pay. She has often inculcated this le&s;&s;on upon my youth, "That my head, my hand and my heart &s;hould be at the &s;ervice of my country." My head and my hand perhaps may fail of rendering her &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances as &s;he receives from better heads and abler
<PB N="4" REF="35">hands: but the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will, at lea&s;t, enable me to &s;hew, that I have an heart as deeply intere&s;ted in my country's welfare, as any of her &s;ons. 'Tis upon this principle alone, that I &s;tand a candidate for the honours which are now propo&s;ed "to the be&s;t di&s;|&s;ertation on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies."</P>
<P>IN treating of this important &s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plan of treating the &s;ubject.</NOTE> was I to enter upon a full and compleat enumera|tion of all the&s;e advantages, I &s;hould doubtle&s;s exceed the limits u&s;ually pre&s;cribed to per|formances of this nature. The principal arguments that I &s;hall advance in favour of this perpetual union, &s;hall be derived from one or other of the&s;e two &s;ources.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From a con&s;ideration of the nature and extent of the Commerce that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, and the amazing increa&s;e of riches and power which they reciprocally derive from that Com|merce.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From the glorious pro&s;pect of the advancement of the Prote&s;tant Religion,
<PB N="5" REF="36">which they profe&s;s, and &s;preading the Go&s;pel in its purity, through the va&s;t benighted re|gions of this we&s;tern world.</P>
<P>BUT a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal argu|ments to be drawn even from the&s;e two &s;ources, would require a volume, in&s;tead of a &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation. I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf chie&s;ly to tho&s;e which may be drawn from the fir&s;t &s;ource, and only touch upon the &s;econd, in the clo&s;e of the performance.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the colonies</NOTE> if we do but take a general view of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing con|dition of the Colonies, and reflect upon the very &s;mall beginnings from which they have ro&s;e, in &s;o &s;hort a time, to &s;uch a height as now renders them the riche&s;t jewel in the crown of <HI>Britain;</HI> if we con&s;ider the figure that <HI>New-England, New-York,</HI> the <HI>Jer&s;eys, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Caro|lina</HI> make at this day, compared with the &s;tate of the&s;e countries in the hands of their original proprietors; if we attend a little to the amazing increa&s;e of their inhabitants, their products and exports, the prodigious quantities of manufactures they take off
<PB N="6" REF="37">from <HI>England,</HI> and the ballance of trade which &s;he obtains from their commodities, the &s;hipping this commerce requires, the &s;ea|men it rai&s;es, the mouths it feeds, the hands it employs, and the accumulated wealth which it brings to thou&s;ands, nay millions of &s;ub|jects, we cannot but be fully convinced of the va&s;t importance and advantage of a per|petual Union between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>American</HI> colonies.</P>
<P>CAN the warme&s;t imagination form to it&s;elf an idea of aught more &s;ublime and delightful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their great improvement.</NOTE> than tho&s;e happy effects which commerce, and the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, have &s;o &s;uddenly produced in coun|tries, which were not long &s;ince the dreary haunts of &s;avage bea&s;ts and &s;avage men. Where ignorance and barbarity frowned over the uncultivated earth, gay fields now &s;mile, bedecked in the yellow robe of full-eared har|ve&s;t; cities ri&s;e maje&s;tic to the view; fleets too croud the capacious harbour with their &s;well|ing canvas, and &s;warms of chearful inhabitants cover the &s;hore with monuments of their indu&s;try, through a long tract of two thou|&s;and miles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="38">FROM this general view of the amazing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncrea&s;e of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A detail of the &s;ubject.</NOTE> I naturally proceed to a particular detail of the advan|tages which are derived from them to the mother country.</P>
<P>CERTAIN it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantages of planting colo|nies.</NOTE> that nothing can contribute more to the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of any trading nation, than the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;ettlements in foreign parts. Experience evinces the truth of this. Their <HI>American</HI> plantations hereto|fore rendered the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> rich and powerful; and the&s;e are now, not only the greate&s;t and con&s;tant, but almo&s;t the only &s;ource of their wealth. Nor have either the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> been inattentive to this im|portant object. Witne&s;s the &s;ettlements of the latter in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which, by their application to commerce, under the ble&s;&s;ings of a moderate government, in a few &s;core years, <HI>from the low and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tates of</HI> Hol|land, <HI>rendered them high and mighty.</HI> Witne&s;s the efforts which <HI>France</HI> made the la&s;t war for the conque&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> a prize worthy to be contended for by the mo&s;t powerful nations. The city of <HI>Tyre,</HI> "who&s;e mer|chants were as princes, and her great men
<PB N="8" REF="39">the honourable of the earth," was, like <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;ituated upon an i&s;land, and like <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> maintained the dominion of the &s;ea by her commerce. The principal &s;eat of her trade, and great &s;ource of her wealth, was the noble colony of <HI>Carthage,</HI> which &s;he founded; the power and naval &s;trength of which was carried to &s;uch a height, by means of commerce, that forty years were &s;pent by the <HI>Romans,</HI> before they were able to &s;ubdue this mighty people.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Preceptor Vol. 2, On Trade and Commerce.</NOTE></P>
<P>To a nation &s;ituated on an i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particularly to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is, accommodated with every conve|niency for trade, the e&s;tabli&s;hing of foreign plantations to promote her commerce is par|ticularly beneficial, &s;ince the inhabitants have no other way of conveying abroad their pro|duct and manufactures but by navigation, which breeds &s;eamen, and brings in wealth to maintain them.

When <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has attained to &s;uch a pitch of grandeur by the indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s of her Colonies, as hath rendered her the admiration and envy of her neighbours, would it be con|&s;i&s;tent with the maxims of ju&s;tice, for her to re&s;ume the privileges &s;he has granted, under which they have &s;o amazingly flouri&s;hed, and which they have never forfeited? No, the rights of <HI>Americans</HI> are e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ame foundation with tho&s;e of <HI>Britain</HI> her&s;elf. She cannot violate them, without, at the &s;ame time, undermining her own con&s;titution; and
<PB N="27" REF="58">the &s;ame &s;word that is &s;heathed in the bowels of <HI>America</HI> mu&s;t inevitably pierce the vitals of <HI>Britain</HI> too, Far other returns, however, may be hoped for by a people, who&s;e com|merce has proved &s;o beneficial to <HI>Britain;</HI> who have, at the expence of &s;o much trea&s;ure and &s;o much blood, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in gaining a compleat a&s;cendency over their common ene|my.

<P>THESE are the methods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of &s;uch a conduct</NOTE> which to me ap|pear mo&s;t likely to perpetuate the glorious union between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colo|nies, which will en&s;ure &s;trength and &s;ucce&s;s to the common cau&s;e, and baffle every at|tempt of their enemies to injure or mole&s;t them.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing a general view of the trade of the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, their produce, exports, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> chiefly extracted from approved hi&s;tories and authentic memoirs.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Appendix, to ob&s;erve &s;ome order, I &s;hall begin with an account of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements to the <HI>Northward;</HI> and fir&s;t with <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> This great i&s;land, which is above three hundred miles long and two hundred broad, forms the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> boundary of the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and extends from thence <HI>Southward</HI> near ten degrees of latitude, along the <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> part of <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> It is chiefly valuable for the great Fi&s;hery upon tho&s;e &s;hoals,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Newfoundland,</HI> its Fi&s;hery.</NOTE> which are called the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> The plenty of Cod, and &s;everal other &s;pecies of Fi&s;h here, is almo&s;t inconceivable, as well as along the &s;hores of the i&s;land of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> the coa&s;ts <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> which pours in
<PB N="34" REF="64">a trea&s;ure of riches on <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Our &s;hare of the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> fi&s;hery was former|ly computed to increa&s;e the national &s;tock at lea&s;t three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year in gold and &s;ilver, remitted for the Cod we &s;ell in the different parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Account of <HI>European</HI> &s;ettlements in <HI>America,</HI> by <HI>Dod&s;ley.</HI></NOTE> of how much more wealth mu&s;t it be pro|ductive at pre&s;ent to the mother country, as <HI>Newfoundland</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> belong now &s;o entirely to <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> The advantages which attend an exten&s;ive and well-managed fi&s;hery are great and obvious. The &s;ea may be con&s;idered as a mine out of which the trea|&s;ure is taken at a very little expence, and even that expence is advantageous, &s;ince it promotes &s;everal manufactures, and goes en|tirely among&s;t our own people. Fi&s;h is a valuable commodity, both at home and a|broad. According to &s;ome writers, the <HI>Dutch</HI> make more of their fi&s;hery in our &s;eas, than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do by the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Be&s;ides, this fi&s;hery, properly attended to, would infalliably furni&s;h us with a con&s;tant &s;upply of experienced, active and healthy
<PB N="35" REF="65">&s;ailors for manning our fleets; the gradual increa&s;e of which would prove not only a con|&s;tant and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of wealth, and add to the ballance of trade in our favour, but augment our maritime force, to a degree that would make us a match for all <HI>Europe</HI> in naval power.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preceptor.</NOTE></P>
<P>ADJACENT to <HI>Newfoundland</HI> is the country of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nova-Scotia.</NOTE> although the progre&s;s of it was at fir&s;t but &s;low, is now become a con&s;iderable &s;ettlement, and is a very ad|vantageous place for fi&s;hing. Twenty-five thou&s;and quintals of fi&s;h have been caught there in one year.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>BUT much more con&s;iderable is the colony of <HI>New-England.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">New-England.</NOTE> This colony is in length near three hundred miles, and in &s;ome part near two hundred miles in breadth, lying between the forty-fir&s;t and forty-fifth de|grees of <HI>North</HI> latitude, and comprizes the four provinces of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Connec|ticut, Rhode-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a noble Cod-fi&s;hery on this coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Fi&s;hery.</NOTE> which employs a va&s;t number of their people,
<PB N="36" REF="66">and proves a very con&s;iderable article of trade. They are enabled by this to export annually above thirty thou&s;and quintals of choice Cod|fi&s;h to <HI>Spain, Italy</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and near twenty thou&s;and quintals of the refu&s;e &s;ort to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as food for the <HI>Negroes,</HI> be&s;ides a large quantity to <HI>Madeira</HI> and <HI>Fyal,</HI> for wines and brandy.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;hip-building is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable which <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Tiade.</NOTE> or the other &s;ea-port towns in <HI>New-England</HI> carry on. This country has materials enough to build &s;hips for half the employment of <HI>Britain.</HI> It can furni&s;h the trade and navy too with naval &s;tores, for the &s;upplies of which from the <HI>Baltic,</HI> two or three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling annually was wont to be expended. In their trade to foreign parts, the profits of their voyage are generally received in bills of exchange upon <HI>London,</HI> or in returns of goods through the hands of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> factors. By this circuitous commerce, they pay in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for various &s;orts of goods got from thence, to the amount of &s;ome hundred thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling a year. Although their commerce is not carried on immediately with
<PB N="37" REF="67"><HI>Great-Britain,</HI> nor with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ve&s;&s;els, yet here the profits chiefly center, where all the money, which the Colonies, can make in any manner, mu&s;t center at la&s;t. Pot-a&s;hes, a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary article in manufactures, particularly in bleaching, as many thou&s;and barrels are annually con&s;umed for this one purpo&s;e in <HI>Ireland,</HI> have, within the&s;e few years, proved a very advantageous article of trade in &s;everal of the Colonies, particularly in <HI>New-England,</HI> and is likely to become a very valuable and growing remittance to the mother country. The amount of the pot-a&s;hes exported home from <HI>New-England</HI> only, within the la&s;t twelve months, is &s;aid to be not le&s;s than thirty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling; and it is imagined that the quantity this year will ari&s;e to a much more con&s;iderable &s;um. The &s;pirit of gain which the making of pot-a&s;hes has already in&s;pired, it is probable, will every year conti|nue to render this manufacture an object of much greater importance to <HI>America</HI> than has been generally imagined. Near &s;ix hundred &s;ail of &s;hips have been laden in a year for <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plantations. From Chri&s;tmas 1747, to Chri&s;tmas 1748, five hundred ve&s;&s;els cleared out from the port of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> only, for
<PB N="38" REF="68">a foreign trade, and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards. Great is the advan|tage therefore of the <HI>New-England</HI> trade and navigation, if only con&s;idered as a nur&s;ery of &s;eamen; how much more by con&s;idering the addition it makes to the national &s;tock?<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THE three contigious provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, <HI>and</HI> Penn&s;ylva|nia, <HI>their trade</HI></NOTE> <HI>viz. New-York, New-Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> are with very little difference the &s;ame in their climate, productions, and the commodities in which they trade; the &s;oil being in general very fertile, abounding not only in its native grain, the <HI>Indian</HI> corn, but few parts of the world exceed the&s;e provinces in the abundance and excellence of their Wheat, Barley, Rye, Oats, Buck-wheat, &amp;c.</P>
<P>GREAT quantities of Flax and Hemp are rai&s;ed in the&s;e provinces. Mines of iron have been opened in them all, and a rich mine of copper has been &s;ucce&s;sfully worked in <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> which may prove highly advantageous to the manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The trade of the&s;e provinces to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> is very
<PB N="39" REF="69">con&s;iderable in Provi&s;ions, Hides, Tallow, Lumber and Soap, &amp;c. for which they can procure Sugars, and from this find &s;ome re|&s;ource of making remittance to <HI>England</HI> for the goods they get from thence. They car|ry on a trade al&s;o with <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy, Madeira</HI> and <HI>Fyal;</HI> they trade likewi&s;e to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> in Hemp, Flax-&s;eed, Lin&s;eed Oil, Furs, and Deer-&s;kins. Flax&s;eed is a very promi&s;ing article of Commerce; as <HI>Ireland</HI> mu&s;t be dependant on the <HI>American</HI> Colonies for an annual &s;upply. In times of &s;carcity, prodigious quantities of wheat are &s;hipped to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well as to other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thus the <HI>Americans</HI> &s;end home to their fellow-&s;ubjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> both goods to increa&s;e the national &s;tock, and al&s;o bread for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t the &s;everal acts which pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, and gained his Maje&s;ty's royal a&s;&s;ent, the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of Parliament, is an Act for allowing the importation of Wheat from <HI>America,</HI> duty free, for a limited time.</NOTE> The importations from <HI>England</HI> into the pro|vince of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> only, it is e&s;timated, hath in &s;everal years amounted to more than half a million &s;terling <HI>per annum.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memorial of the Merchants and Traders of the city of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>TOBACCO is the &s;tanding commodity of both the&s;e colonies. A late &s;en&s;ible writer computes that there are &s;hipped from the&s;e places annually, 90,000 hog&s;heads of Tobacco at an average of 952 weight each; 30,000 of the&s;e are expended in home con&s;umption, the duty of each is twenty-&s;even pounds &s;ter|ling, and the amount of the whole duty on them is above eight hundred thou&s;and pounds; and of the remaining 60,000 hog&s;heads, after the imports and part of the &s;ub&s;idy are drawn back, about one-fifth of the &s;um is produced into the Exchequer from every hog&s;head that is re-exported, which is above three hundred thou&s;and pounds more. The whole amount for the cu&s;toms of Tobacco is more than a million. Such is the immen&s;e advantage
<PB N="41" REF="71">which the Mother Country derives from the article of Tobacco alone, which &s;he gets from her Colonies.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">See Con&s;iderations on the propriety of impo&s;ing taxes on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, for rai&s;ing a revenue by Act of Parliament; and al&s;o a Computation by Sir <HI>Thomas Dally,</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THE trade of <HI>Carolina</HI> has three great &s;taple commodities, Rice, Indigo, and Naval Stores, which it yields more abundantly than all the re&s;t of our Colonies. Rice antiently formed by it&s;elf the &s;taple of <HI>Carolina.</HI> The export of this commodity from <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> in the year 1731, amounted only to 41,957 barrels. In a few years afterwards, the product of it was computed to return to <HI>Great-Britan</HI> at lea&s;t &pound;. 80,000 <HI>per annum,</HI> including freight and commi&s;&s;ions, which are the mo&s;t profi|table articles in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> commerce. In the year 1754, the export of Rice from <HI>Charles|town,</HI> amounted to 104,682 barrels. In the year 1757, this branch of commerce was
<PB N="42" REF="72">computed to be annually worth, at the lowe&s;t e&s;timation, &pound;. 150,000 &s;terling. Great has been its increa&s;e &s;ince; and we may well reckon it to be at this time worth &pound;. 200,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>IT was long before <HI>Carolina</HI> went into the profitable trade of Indigo; they began it &s;ince the year 1750, and in the year 1754, was exported from <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> to the amount of above 200,000 lb. weight; and 500,000 lb. weight was made in the year 1757. If the in|habitants continue to improve the advantages with the &s;ame &s;pirit in which they have begun, they mu&s;t naturally and nece&s;&s;arily come to &s;upply the whole con&s;umption of the world with this commodity, and con&s;equently make their country the riche&s;t part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Account of <HI>European</HI> Settlements, printed by <HI>Dod&s;ley.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THE author is very &s;en&s;ible, that it would have been proper, in compo&s;ing the following E&s;&s;ay, to have con&s;ulted with gentlemen who re&s;ide in the &s;everal places he had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of, and are well acquainted with the na|ture and extent of their commerce. Would the time, allowed for the&s;e performances, have af|fored him an opportunity of procuring &s;uch information, he flatters him&s;elf his piece would have been more <HI>original,</HI> with re&s;pect to matters of trade, and more worthy of public notice. He would have been thereby enabled to form a more exact e&s;timate of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of trade in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> Depriv'd of this advantage, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to commercial writers, among&s;t whom he is chiefly indebted to <HI>Gee</HI> and <HI>Beawes.</HI> And when it is con&s;idered, that few per&s;ons, though of far greater abilities and experience in the commercial world than the author, would be able of their own know|ledge to furni&s;h an adequate account of every material branch in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>American</HI> trade, he cannot de&s;pair of the Reader's in|dulgence.</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION II.</HEAD>
<P>_THE &s;ituation of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world by the &s;urrounding ocean, and de&s;titute of tho&s;e endle&s;s re|&s;ources, which an extent of continent affords its inhabitants, very early &s;ugge&s;ted to ju|dicious and ob&s;erving men, that a naval force would be the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ure means of her defence, again&s;t foreign encroachments. The great <HI>Alfred,</HI> of glorious and immortal memory, was fully convinced of this impor|tant truth. He knew, by &s;ad experience, that the want of &s;uch a force had &s;ubjected the i&s;land to the in&s;ults and depredations of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and other <HI>Northern</HI> robbers. Ani|mated with affection for his &s;ubjects, and fir'd with a ju&s;t re&s;entment of the injuries they had received, he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;upply &s;uch a fatal defect. By equipping, with in|credible expedition, a fleet, con&s;iderable in
<PB N="50" REF="79">tho&s;e days, he rendered him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, and freed his people from the dread of being plundered. But in a few years, this beneficial, this glorious project, un&s;upported by a &s;ufficient fund, was almo&s;t entirely laid a&s;ide. The inhabitants, employed in the ex|erci&s;e of arms, or agriculture, and rai&s;ing what was barely nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, could not po&s;&s;ibly defray the expence of having a fleet always in readine&s;s. The <HI>Danes,</HI> taking advantage of their remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in this important affair, &s;oon over-run and &s;ub|dued the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land; but in|attentive to a le&s;&s;on, which their own &s;ucce&s;s might have taught them, they, in their turn, fell a prey to an innundation of <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> navy, though &s;everal at|tempts were made to render it re&s;pectable by monarchs, who under&s;tood their own intere&s;ts, continued, neverthele&s;s, to make no great figure, till the reign of queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Till this time al&s;o the trade of <HI>England</HI> was very &s;mall, and contracted within a narrow com|pa&s;s. It con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in exporting Tin, Lead, Wool, and a few other articles, which &s;erved to purcha&s;e what foreign goods were
<PB N="51" REF="80">wanted. That wi&s;e queen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a wi&s;e and experienced mini&s;try, di&s;covered the grand &s;ecret unknown to her predece&s;&s;ors; they knew the advantages of a fleet, but the con&s;equent expences they knew not how to defray. An exten&s;ive commerce was now very judiciou&s;ly con&s;idered as the only &s;ource adequate to &s;uch large and continual di&s;bur&s;ements. This it was thought, would not only afford a &s;up|ply of money, &s;ufficient to equip and main|tain a powerful navy, but would al&s;o be a &s;chool or nur&s;ery of &s;eamen.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e con&s;iderations, encouragement was given to the per&s;ecuted <HI>Walloons</HI> to re|move and &s;ettle in <HI>England.</HI> They very wil|lingly embraced an opportunity of tran&s;port|ing them&s;elves to a land of freedom, and brought with them the Woollen manufactory, which, favoured with the countenance and protection of a wi&s;e government, &s;oon arrived at great perfection. In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame plan, a trade was opened to <HI>Turkey, Mu&s;covy,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and almo&s;t every con&s;iderable country in the known world. Under the au&s;pices of the &s;ame queen, plan|tations were begun in <HI>AMERICA,</HI> and pro&s;e|cuted
<PB N="52" REF="81">with vigour. They at fir&s;t met with nearly in&s;uperable difficulties; neverthele&s;s, by the indefatigable indu&s;try and per&s;everance of the planters, and the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their mother Country, tho&s;e difficulties were &s;ur|mounted, and the Colonies brought to a pitch of greatne&s;s, that, con&s;idering the &s;hort time of their growth, is almo&s;t incredible.</P>
<P>I HAVE taken this retro&s;pect in order to &s;hew, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> &s;prung up together. They are mo&s;t nearly allied, being children of the &s;ame good policy; and it is worthy the notice and attention of every politician, who &s;tudies to promote his coun|try's welfare, that as they had their ri&s;e at the &s;ame time, they have ever &s;ince continued to increa&s;e and flouri&s;h in proportion. Their de|pendence is mutual, and if either of them be affected, the others &s;ooner or later will feel it in a very &s;en&s;ible manner.</P>
<P>GREAT has been my &s;urprize at the ig|norance or malevolence of &s;everal late pro|ductions. The writers of them, either blinded by pa&s;&s;ion, or employed and in&s;tigated by the
<PB N="53" REF="82">enemies of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, have endea|voured to &s;ow di&s;cord and di&s;&s;ention between the Mother Country and her <HI>American</HI> Colo|nies. Some have &s;trove to render the colo|ni&s;ts &s;u&s;pected, by repre&s;enting them as an ungrateful, licentious people, aiming at in|dependence, and impatient of any &s;ubordi|nation to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> whil&s;t others, no le&s;s enemies to the welfare and pro&s;perity of both, would excite <HI>their</HI> jealou&s;y, by under|valuing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>&s;he</HI> has offerded them, and placing her in the light of a cruel Step|mother.</P>
<P>I am too well convinced of the good &s;en&s;e of my countrymen, both of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> to imagine them capable of being deluded by &s;uch partial repre&s;entations, Con&s;idering them&s;elves as members of one grand body politic, they will naturally con|clude, that the good of the whole mu&s;t re&s;ult from a due connection and harmony of all the parts; and from the mutual exchange and intercour&s;e of friendly offices. Neverthele&s;s, as this point &s;eems to have been controverted, a few ob&s;ervations, tending to evince, that a "perpetual <HI>UNION</HI> between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>American</HI> Colonies, will be mutually and
<PB N="54" REF="83"><HI>reciprocally</HI> advantageous," may not be le&s;s agreeable, than nece&s;&s;ary, in the pre&s;ent Di&s;|&s;ertation.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;ubject, the mo&s;t truly important and intere&s;ting, which can claim a <HI>Briton</HI>'s notice, and does honour to that worthy gen|tleman who propos'd its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by the Sons of this Seminary. Struck with its va&s;t delicacy and importance, and con&s;cious of in|ability to treat it in a manner &s;uited to its dignity, I had almo&s;t declin'd the arduous ta&s;k; but it is a glory even to fail in great at|tempts; and if I &s;hould afford a hint to &s;ome abler pen, or contribute to remove the &s;malle&s;t prejudice, I &s;hall think my&s;elf ex|tremely happy in being &s;o far beneficial to the public.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that the de|fence, the &s;trength and glory of <HI>Britain,</HI> principally depend on her Navy; and that her Navy can only be maintained by Trade and Commerce. The&s;e are points too plain to be denied or di&s;puted by the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e &s;ceptic: and it is a very natural in|ference from the&s;e premi&s;es, that whatever contributes to enlarge and extend her com|merce, is highly advantageous to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="84">IT mu&s;t likewi&s;e be acknowledged, that new &s;ettlements and young countries &s;tand in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection of &s;ome powerful commercial &s;tate. De&s;titute of the&s;e, they would be expo&s;ed to the attacks of lawle&s;s invaders, for want of &s;trength to defend them&s;elves, and to the inclemency of weather for want of proper cloathing; for manufactures cannot be brought to any de|gree of perfection, or extended to advantage, except in well-&s;ettled countries; although agriculture, where the land is tolerably fer|tile, and the &s;ettlement &s;ecure, may enable the inhabitants to procure the nece&s;&s;ary manufactures in return for its productions.</P>
<P>I HOPE therefore to make it appear, that a reciprocal emolument will ari&s;e from a per|petual union between <HI>Britain</HI> and her <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Colonies; as &s;he may by their means greatly enlarge her trade and commerce, and become &s;till more rich and powerful; and as they will reap the advantage of her riches and power, by being protected from their ene|mies, and &s;upplied with the conveniencies of life at a cheaper rate, and of a better quality than if manufactured by them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="85">IF we take a &s;urvey of the commerce of <HI>Britain,</HI> we &s;hall find it extended to almo&s;t every part of the known world; there is &s;carcely any place con&s;iderable for trade that is not vi&s;ited by her adventurous merchants. The means which have enabled her to ac|quire, and &s;upport with dignity and advantage, &s;uch large mercantile connections, are to be &s;ought for in her various manufactories; among&s;t which the Woollen is univer&s;ally al|lowed the preference. Commercial writers have taken much pains to enumerate the par|ticular kinds of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures; to &s;hew their mutual dependence, and wherein the peculiar advantage of each con&s;i&s;ts. As their works are in every one's hands, it is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for me to repeat their &s;ub&s;tance, and to particularize the articles which con|tribute to &s;upport the trade of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there are two branches of commerce, whcih though not &s;o generally attended to, are neverthele&s;s mo&s;t highly beneficial. The Fi&s;heries of <HI>Newfoundland, Cape-Breton</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and there-exportation of foreign goods, have greatly increa&s;ed the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> navigation,
<PB N="57" REF="86">riches and power. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that 2000 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els are employed in tho&s;e fi&s;heries: the number of hands nece&s;&s;ary to navigate them, to cure and dry the fi&s;h, mu&s;t be very large; and great the con&s;umption of pro|vi&s;ions, nets and other uten&s;ils, brought almo&s;t entirely from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>GOODS for re-exportation are received from different quarters; &s;ome from <HI>Germany, Flan|ders,</HI> &amp;c. but in the greate&s;t quantities from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> The bullion &s;ent to the former, is made an objection to that trade, the force of which it is not my province to determine. Nothing of this &s;ort can, however, be objected to the trade to the <HI>American</HI> plantations, which is of all mo&s;t ad|vantageous to the nation. There is &s;carcely any one &s;pecies of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manufactures, that is not vended in <HI>America;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>India</HI> likewi&s;e come here to a ready market. In &s;hort, it is from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that the Colo|nies import almo&s;t every thing, requi&s;ite for cloathing, agriculture, and other u&s;es. In return for the&s;e, they &s;end her Sugar, To|bacco, Rice, Furs, Pot-a&s;h, Naval Stores,
<PB N="58" REF="87">Gold and Silver, and the ballance of a con&s;i|derable trade with <HI>Portugal, Spain,</HI> and other countries, bordering on the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> in Bills of Exchange.</P>
<P>HERE is an occa&s;ion to expatiate on the be|nefits deriv'd to <HI>Britain</HI> from each of the&s;e particulars; to ob&s;erve the prodigious prices &s;he paid for them to foreigners, before their production in <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> and the com|comparatively &s;mall prices for which they are procured at pre&s;ent. The large quantities re-exported to foreign markets, and pro|ducing a demand upon them for very great &s;ums annually, might al&s;o be mentioned with much propriety. Nor would it be ami&s;s to &s;hew the immen&s;e addition the&s;e articles bring to the revenue. But all the&s;e topics have been &s;o largely in&s;i&s;ted on in late pamphlets and detached pieces, and mu&s;t be &s;o well known to every one, that further mention of them is unnece&s;&s;ary. Only I would beg leave to ob&s;erve a particular &s;till unnoticed; in the year 1703, the government of <HI>Sweden</HI> refu&s;ed a &s;upply of Pitch and Tar, unle&s;s for ready money, at their own price, and in <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="88">bottoms. Such a gro&s;s impo&s;ition awaken'd the indignation and re&s;entment of <HI>Britain,</HI> and taught the true policy of deriving them from the Colonies. Encouragement was thereupon given, and &s;oon produced a &s;uffi|cient quantity to an&s;wer all her demands. But the &s;pirit of the nation was again lull'd; the <HI>Sweeds</HI> re&s;umed their trade, and that of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> was very much neglected.</P>
<P>SOME, perhaps, will readily grant, that the exportation of the&s;e articles from <HI>America,</HI> is beneficial to her, and &s;erves to enrich her inhabitants; but in what re&s;pect can it be e&s;teemed advantageous to <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion admits a very obvious &s;olu|tion. It is advantageous to <HI>Britain</HI> in various re&s;pects. It affords freight for many thou|&s;and ton of her &s;hipping, and a nur&s;ery of &s;eamen for the royal navy; the commi&s;&s;ions enrich her merchants, and the re-exportation brings abundance of wealth into the kingdom. The duties they pay are an immen&s;e increa&s;e of the revenue, and they are received from the plantations in return for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> produc|tions and manufactures, of which the Colonies
<PB N="60" REF="89">take off more than any foreign market what|ever. The importation of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> goods, and tho&s;e received by the way of <HI>Britain,</HI> has, on a medium, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, amounted to upwards of two millions annually; a &s;um &s;o immen&s;e, that although the Colonies abound with valuable articles, extremely well adapted to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> market, and very beneficial to her trade and navigation, and though they make large remittances by the way of <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in bills of exchange, yet the produce of all the&s;e &s;ources leaves a large ballance in favour of <HI>Britain,</HI> which they pay her in gold and &s;ilver. This in part furni&s;hes bullion for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> trade; on account of which, and the va&s;t con&s;umption of <HI>India</HI> goods, the flouri&s;hing condition of that valu|able branch of commerce, may, in no &s;mall degree, very ju&s;tly be attributed to the <HI>American</HI> Colonies.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee, that not only every &s;pecies of the manufactures of <HI>Britain,</HI> but al&s;o her fo|reign trade and navigation are much indebted to <HI>America.</HI> Hence riches have flowed into her coffers, and enabled her to &s;upport a fleet,
<PB N="61" REF="90">&s;ufficient to maintain the empire of the ocean. And whoever con&s;iders the &s;tate of the Co|lonies, mu&s;t conclude, that they have not been lo&s;ers by their intercour&s;e with their mother country. Con&s;ideration being had of the &s;hort time the <HI>American</HI> &s;ettlements have been made, the inhabitants have increa&s;ed in riches and number to admiration; though far from en|joying that affluence, of which &s;ome would repre&s;ent them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The advantages of their trade have been mutual. <HI>She,</HI> by their means, has continued to ri&s;e in wealth and power; whil&s;t <HI>they,</HI> in the &s;un&s;hine of her a&s;|&s;i&s;tance and protection, and the enjoyment of a beneficial commerce, have grown up and flouri&s;hed, and &s;till continue to flouri&s;h, the equal advantage, ornament, and glory of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;hould we only take a retro&s;pect, &s;hould we confine our&s;elves barely to what is pa&s;t, much inju&s;tice would be done to this animating &s;ubject, and we &s;hould lo&s;e a pro&s;|pect which cannot but afford the highe&s;t plea&s;ure to every <HI>Briton.</HI> Let us therefore look forward to the mutual benefits, which, with proper attention, may hereafter ari&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="91">IN order to this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary briefly to enumerate tho&s;e articles of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s foreign importations, which have relation to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. They are raw, thrown and wrought Silk, Velvets, Linens, Timber, Boards, Pot-a&s;h, and all kinds of Naval Stores. Several writers on trade have computed the ballances paid by <HI>Britain</HI> for tho&s;e &s;orts of goods to <HI>France, Italy, Germany, Flanders, Norway, Denmark, Sweeden</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> and none I have met with make the amount le&s;s than two millions annually; this &s;he di&s;charges in gold and &s;ilver. Perhaps matter of fact may be oppo&s;ed to this e&s;timate, becau&s;e there is not &s;o great an exportation of bullion; but the argument is not hereby invalidated. If the ballance on &s;ome other trade: which would el&s;e be brought home and added to the national &s;tock, be diverted and &s;ent to tho&s;e places, it is equally pernicious to the kingdom, as if it was imported and then ex|ported. And this is certainly the ca&s;e. <HI>Bri|tain</HI> on her particular trade with <HI>Holland,</HI> for in&s;tance, has a right to a very large ballance in &s;pecie; but the latter, by keeping in her Debt the nations abovementioned, or &s;everal
<PB N="63" REF="92">them, who have demands on <HI>Britain,</HI> is en|abled by their means to &s;atisfy her <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> creditors, and &s;ave her money; and be&s;ides this, bullion is &s;ent to <HI>Holland</HI> to an&s;wer bills of exchange drawn in favour of tho&s;e nations.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of this mu&s;t deeply af|fect every one, who has at heart the trade and pro&s;perity of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and would pre&s;erve her independent of her <HI>European</HI> neighbours; e&s;pecially as the wollen manu|factory is in its decline. <HI>France</HI> not only &s;upplies her own people with woollens, but by the cheapne&s;s of her goods, and the counte|nance of the court of <HI>Spain,</HI> has in a great mea&s;ure &s;upplanted <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> markets. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves, &s;en&s;ible of their impolitic conduct, &s;eem determined to per&s;i&s;t no longer in an error, the re&s;ult of ill-grounded principles and mi&s;taken notions of honour. They have made &s;everal efforts to e&s;tabli&s;h manufactories of their own Wool, which have by no means proved fruitle&s;s. Other nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> ob&s;erving the &s;uc|ce&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> have copied her example, by
<PB N="64" REF="93">which <HI>England</HI> has lo&s;t much of her woollen trade, particularly with <HI>Portugal,</HI> where the importation of this &s;taple commodity &s;eems to meet with many di&s;couragements.</P>
<P>FROM this reflection our attention is natu|rally turned to <HI>America,</HI> which will be her &s;ure&s;t, and perhaps in time, her only market, as re&s;tored fabrication is likely to take place in every part of <HI>Europe.</HI> If under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch large &s;ums are continually paid for foreign imports, the ballance of trade in favour of <HI>Britain</HI> will be materially di|mini&s;hed. The only remedy for this grow|ing evil is to be found in <HI>America,</HI> who can furni&s;h a variety of the mo&s;t u&s;eful raw ma|terials on terms mutually beneficial.</P>
<P>GREAT quantities of Furs and Peltry have been, and &s;till are, &s;ent from the Colonies to <HI>Britain,</HI> the acqui&s;ition of <HI>Canada</HI> having thrown that whole trade into our hands; but it is capable of greater improvement, and may well &s;uper&s;ede the fur trade to Ru&s;&s;ia. The <HI>Northern Indians,</HI> with a little encou|ragement, will bring their Ermines and other fine furs from the 70th degree of latitude,
<PB N="65" REF="94">which is parallel with the <HI>European</HI> countries, where the mo&s;t valuable Furs are procured. The di&s;tance tho&s;e people will travel to trade with our &s;ettlements, is well known to all acquainted with their affairs. This would likewi&s;e be a means of di&s;per&s;ing <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures among&s;t a multitude of <HI>Indian</HI> tribes, at pre&s;ent unknown to our traders.</P>
<P>IRON mines are &s;o plenty in almo&s;t every province on the continent, that it is thought with good rea&s;on, they could &s;upply all the markets in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>As for Timber, Boards, Pitch and Tar, they may likewi&s;e be procured here in great abundance. <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> extended along the coa&s;t more than 2000 miles, and reaching an unknown, but prodigious way into the continent, is almo&s;t one continued fore&s;t, fill'd with every kind of u&s;eful timber, not|with&s;tanding the great deva&s;tions made within the two la&s;t centuries.</P>
<P>HERE it may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that the expen&s;ive freight of the&s;e bulky articles, would render them unfit for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> markets. The <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and others,
<PB N="66" REF="95">employed at pre&s;ent in the Lumber trade, are no doubt by long experience become &s;killfull and can afford their goods at the cheape&s;t. rates: but the Colonies might be put upon a par with them by encouragement from the legi&s;lature. Greater difficulties in other in|&s;tances have yielded to the efforts of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> adventurers. <HI>America</HI> may vie with any coun|try whatever in plenty of materials, and other conveniences; and if large bulky &s;hips were built, of &s;even or eight hundred tons, capable of being navigated by fewer hands in pro|portion to their burthen, than tho&s;e in pre&s;ent u&s;e, the expence of navigation would be much dimini&s;hed. The difference of di&s;tance be|tween <HI>America,</HI> and the Gulphs of <HI>Bothnia</HI> and <HI>Finland,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> is incon&s;iderable; and <HI>America</HI> is neare&s;t to <HI>Li&s;bon, Cadiz,</HI> and all the markets to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Cape Fini&s;terre,</HI> and therefore might more conve|niently &s;upply tho&s;e markets.</P>
<P>THE inconvenience, and even ab&s;urdity of being &s;upplied with Naval Stores by foreign|ers, be&s;ides the di&s;advantage of con&s;uming the national wealth, is very evident. Every one knows, that &s;hould a war be entered into with tho&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="96">nations, or &s;hould they be confederated with the enemies of <HI>Britain,</HI> by cutting off the &s;inews of her &s;trength, they might reduce her to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Both inconve|niences would be remedied, if Naval Stores were entirely procured from <HI>America;</HI> who, being connected with the Mother Country by every powerful tie, would not fail to afford them in plenty on any emergency.</P>
<P>HEMP, Flax and Silk, manufactured and unmanufactured, are articles for which <HI>Britain</HI> pays large &s;ums to foreigners, as was ob|&s;erved before. Rough materials may be procured in the Colonies, which abound with low bottoms and deep rich &s;oils, requiring only cultivation to produce the mo&s;t luxuriant crops of Hemp and Flax, particularly in the <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies. To confirm this, I might mention the fertility of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which lies nearly under the &s;ame parallels of latitude with <HI>Florida, Georgia, Carolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> and is famous for the production of the&s;e commodities in the greate&s;t perfection; but experience is preferable to a thou&s;and ar|guments.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="97">I MENTION Silk, becau&s;e the abundance of Mulberry-trees in the <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies, &s;eems naturally to point out the cultivation of that valuable article. To this may be added, that their &s;oil, climate and marme &s;ituation, are pretty much the &s;ame with <HI>Nankin</HI> and <HI>Chekiang,</HI> the mo&s;t famous Silk provinces in all <HI>China.</HI> The&s;e circum&s;tances afford good rea&s;on to believe, the Silk-worm would thrive very well here, and experience heightens the belief into certainty. Small trials have been made, and &s;ome &s;ilk produced in <HI>Carolina,</HI> was e&s;teemed by good judges equal to the fine&s;t of <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> The hands employed in the cultivation of Hemp and Flax, will have &s;uf|ficient lei&s;ure to gather the leaves and feed the worms, which will enable the planters to afford all the&s;e articles cheaper than may at fir&s;t be imagined.</P>
<P>FROM this it &s;eems evident, that materials for carrying on the Silk and Linen manu|factories to the greate&s;t extent, may be pro|cured from <HI>America.</HI> And in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are prodigious numbers of poor, who would chearfully work to maintain them&s;elves and families, doom'd to mi&s;ery for want of em|ployment.
<PB N="69" REF="98">To e&s;tabli&s;h manufactories of tho&s;e goods by public encouragement, would therefore be an undertaking of the highe&s;t utility both to <HI>Britain</HI> and the Colonies. <HI>"Fas e&s;t et ab ho&s;te doceri."</HI> It could be no di&s;grace to imitate in this re&s;pect the policy of <HI>France,</HI> who knowing that trade is the only &s;olid foundation of greatne&s;s, is en|deavouring to monopolize the three grand branches of manufactures.</P>
<P>NOR need the woollen manufacturer be afraid, that his bu&s;ine&s;s would hereby receive the &s;malle&s;t prejudice. There is a &s;ufficient number of hands in the three kingdoms to carry on each of them to the greate&s;t ad|vantage. Many who at pre&s;ent can't afford them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;ary covering, would then be able to purcha&s;e more decent and com|fortable cloathing; and the Colonies having their &s;ources of remittance enlarged, would increa&s;e their already enormous demands for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures.</P>
<P>SHOULD this beneficial &s;cheme be carried into execution, more than two millions would be annually &s;aved to the nation; ade|quate
<PB N="70" REF="99">employment provided for an incredible number of hands in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> and the trade, navigation and riches of both would receive very large additions.</P>
<P>IT may po&s;&s;ibly be thought from my ap|pearing to confine fabrication to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that I am no friend to the Colonies, as there has of late been &s;o many propo&s;als for erect|ing manufactories in <HI>America.</HI> I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf very unhappy in the di&s;plea&s;ure of my countrymen. None of the numerous &s;ons of <HI>Briti&s;h America</HI> more ardently wi&s;hes her pro&s;perity than my&s;elf, or has a heart more devoted to her &s;ervice. Con&s;cious there|fore of the rectitude of my intentions, I will not doubt of being heard with candor, tho' I venture to maintain, that to divert their hands from their pre&s;ent lucrative Employments, and &s;et them to work on manufactories, would be incompatible with the true intere&s;t of the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE number of their inhabitants, though near three millions, is &s;mall in proportion to the extent of continent they po&s;&s;e&s;s. Lands are con&s;equently cheap, and labour dear;
<PB N="71" REF="100">whatever therefore can be produced by means of the land with little labour, mu&s;t prove mo&s;t advantageous. Hence ari&s;es the pro|priety of &s;hip-building, wherein the materials, thus procurable, are of primary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, agriculture will bring more emolument to the Colonies, than could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from manufacturing goods, who&s;e chief value depends on the artificer's labour. Nor will this circum&s;tance render them at all more dependent. Abounding with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and materials for fabrication, the produce of the willing earth, they can at any time <HI>command</HI> a &s;upply of the goods they want, in greater plenty, and of a better quality than would have been the re&s;ult of their labour, employed in manufactures. I would not be under&s;tood by this rea&s;oning, to exclude the indu&s;trious farmer from work|ing up his Wool, and other coar&s;e articles, unfit for exportation; this will be doubly advantageous, it will be a &s;aving to him&s;elf, and enable him to pay for the finer goods he may purcha&s;e with greater ea&s;e and punc|tuality.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="101">Now upon a review of the whole we find, that the trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to &s;ome places is va&s;tly advantageous, bringing large &s;ums of money into the kingdom; to others, al|though no returns are made in &s;pecie, but as much of their produce and manufactures re|ceived as is &s;ent them of <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> it is never|thele&s;s profitable, affording employment for her people; to a third &s;ort, though perhaps lucrative to &s;ome private merchants, it is very pernicious, and unprofitable to the nation in general, as it drains the kingdom of great quantities of gold and &s;ilver. We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the latter is removed by the colonies, which are capable of furni&s;hing, at lea&s;t, materials for manufacturing all the particulars procured thereby, with mutual benefit. It likewi&s;e appears, that a great part of her mo&s;t ad|vantageous trade depends on the Colonies, and that it may be &s;till farther improved by <HI>America;</HI> that whil&s;t the Colonies have contri|buted &s;o much to enrich and aggrandize their mother country, they have them&s;elves been enriched and protected; and that the &s;cheme for rendering them &s;till more advantageous to <HI>Britain,</HI> promi&s;es them an equal &s;hare of profit.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="102">WHOEVER con&s;iders the&s;e circum&s;tances, will, I am per&s;uaded, anticipate my conclu|&s;ion; but I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject without &s;ugge&s;ting another argument, which will not be e&s;teemed a trifling one by men of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and reflection. The benefits ari&s;ing from the Prote&s;tant Religion to tho&s;e &s;tates which have embraced it, and indeed to the world in general, are very obvious. Every one, ac|quainted with the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> mu&s;t ac|knowledge their &s;ituation is far better than it was four or five centuries ago; the religious and civil liberties of mankind, are under&s;tood with more clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; the human mind, which before was crampt and confined in its re&s;earches, has become more expanded, and acquired much clearer knowledge in the Arts, in Philo&s;ophy and Divinity. It is now very well known, that Philo&s;ophy does not con&s;i&s;t in monki&s;h jargon, and that without Virtue there can be no Religion. Even tho&s;e countries, that are enemies to Prote&s;tanti&s;m, have been &s;harers in its happy e&s;&s;ects; the rays of knowledge have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, illuminated their clouded under&s;tandings; but like tho&s;e of the &s;un within the <HI>Polar</HI> climates, they are weak and languid.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="103"><HI>Great-Britain</HI> has been the bulwark of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t, ever &s;ince its exi&s;tence; and by her the attacks of its enemies have been repelled. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on principles of Civil and Religious Liberty, have hitherto been protected therein by their own noble efforts, and her kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and while they remain united, the enjoyment of their liberties of both kinds, will, no doubt, be continued in its full extent. What would be the con&s;equence of a di&s;|union, none can tell; but there is more than a probability, that the&s;e particulars would be deeply affected. <HI>France,</HI> our ever-watchful enemy, will be ready to &s;eize any advantage that may offer. She would have her arma|ments prepared to enter by <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> and the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and might po&s;&s;ibly over-run all the Colonies. Should this be the ca&s;e, the candle of Science would be &s;oon extin|gui&s;hed, and Ignorance introduced, in order to keep up a blind devotion and implicit obedience. The Genius of Liberty would be driven from <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> where &s;he hath hitherto delighted to re&s;ide; and whether the mother country would be more fortunate, I leave to the con&s;ideration of her Patriot Sons. ALL</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="104">SINCE, then, &s;o many reciprocal advantages are the re&s;ult of Union between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> to render that Union perpetual, will be the only means of &s;ecuring and tran&s;mit|ing them to po&s;terity, together with tho&s;e immen&s;e benefits, which are yet in pro&s;pect.

<P>_HOWEVER mankind, as indivi|duals, may be &s;wayed by the different motives of pa&s;&s;ion, pre|judice, and honour; yet, when formed into &s;tates and communities, the&s;e all &s;ub&s;ide; and Intere&s;t becomes the grand pre|vailing principle that actuates all their moti|ons. It is the Pole-&s;tar by which the political pilot mu&s;t ever guide the helm of govern|ment, where too keen a pur&s;uit of it does not interfere with the faith of treaties, or the natural rights of mankind. An accurate di&s;|cernment therefore of the true intere&s;t of a nation, and a &s;teady active prudence in the pur&s;uit of it, con&s;titute the true political wi&s;dom that ought to di&s;tingui&s;h every &s;tate&s;|man.
<PB N="80" REF="108">And &s;o &s;en&s;ible are mini&s;ters of every complexion of the truth of this doctrine, that, however &s;elfi&s;h and pernicious their views, they &s;eldom fail to cover them over with the plau&s;ible and &s;pecious colouring of na|tional advantage.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hing a grand COMMERCIAL INTEREST &s;eems now to be the great ob|ject of the regard and attention of the different &s;tates of Europe. To this they are every day &s;acrificing the le&s;s important con&s;iderations of national pride and prejudice. Whatever, therefore, tends to promote or ob&s;truct this great principle of government, is now become a matter of &s;erious con&s;equence, which de&s;erves the clo&s;e&s;t attention and the tendere&s;t care. And amid&s;t the rival&s;hip and contention of the &s;everal European powers in attaining this capital point, happy will that nation be, who&s;e admini&s;tration &s;hall lead to &s;uch mea&s;ures as are mo&s;t conducive to this end, as a &s;uperi|ority may now be gained that may bla&s;t the hopes, and at once da&s;h the expectations, of its a&s;piring competitors.</P>
<P>IF there is any one, who at pre&s;ent bids fair|e&s;t for this pre-eminence, it is <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="109">who&s;e free and happy con&s;titution mo&s;t ad|mirably protects and cheri&s;hes an enterprizing commercial &s;pirit. A &s;ecurity of per&s;on and property is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the very being of a <HI>commercial nation,</HI> and in this re|&s;pect none of its rivals can claim &s;uperiority to the happy &s;ubjects of <HI>Britain,</HI> who&s;e wi&s;e and valiant ance&s;tors have handed down to them this glorious &s;ecurity, &s;ealed with their blood. But not even this, nor her natural &s;ituation &s;o well adapted for &s;afety from her enemies and the advancement of her trade, nor yet the active genius and temper of her children may be &s;ufficient to en&s;ure her &s;uc|ce&s;s, if her colonies are neglected or oppre&s;&s;|ed. If properly attended to, they will prove the true &s;ources of her wealth and power, and enable her to &s;oar above her emulating neigh|bours, who will view her rapid progre&s;s with envy and admiration. To enumerate the many mutual advantages they have already received from their clo&s;e and intimate con|nection would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k&mdash;but it would require little le&s;s than in&s;piration to for&s;ee all the reciprocal advantages that will attend a future Union between them formed upon proper, upon generous principles.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="110">To point out tho&s;e that are mo&s;t obvious, and which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, is the de|&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay, which pretends to no more than &s;ketching out the imperfect out-lines of a picture, who&s;e beauty has indeed been &s;haded: but we tru&s;t and believe that time and experience will point out tho&s;e blemi&s;hes, and &s;oon re&s;tore it to its former purity and lu&s;tre. To facilitate this has been the de&s;ign of the generous friend to this in&s;titution, who propo&s;ed the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and it is a de&s;ign worthy the benevolent patriotic &s;pirit of an Engli&s;h Senator.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world and arbiter of nations, by her wi&s;e policy and prudent con|duct to her allies and coloni&s;ts, rai&s;ed her&s;elf to an a&s;toni&s;hing pitch of grandeur and power; &s;he encouraged, &s;he incorporated, and never deprived them of any e&s;&s;ential privileges. By the&s;e rules &s;he gained their affections, and of factious, turbulent citizens, and often of in|vererate enemies &s;he made faithful, zealous, and u&s;eful &s;ubjects. <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has at much expence of blood and trea&s;ure &s;ecured and protected her <HI>American</HI> colonies from the de&s;igns of <HI>France,</HI> who viewed their ri&s;ing power and growing importance with a jealous eye, and therefore determined to nip them in
<PB N="83" REF="111">the bud, before they could ripen to any de|gree of formidable perfection. Happily for us the&s;e ambitious and fatal projects were cru&s;hed by the united valour and &s;kill of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her provinces. To a hap|py and &s;ucce&s;sful Union in War, let us then add the happy and harmonious Union of Peace, nor lo&s;e its ble&s;&s;ings by in-attention to, or di&s;regard of, the ine&s;timable advantages that may, nay that mu&s;t attend it.</P>
<P>Colonies are emigrations from the mother country, either occa&s;ioned by a quick Popula|tion, &s;o as to render it too &s;mall for the &s;upport of its growing inhabitants; or by Oppre&s;&s;ion, Tyranny, and undue exerci&s;e of Power; or &s;ometimes by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and de&s;olation of War.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they are always formed not only with the countenance, but with the expre&s;s encouragement and direction of the mother country.&mdash;In the &s;econd in&s;tance un|le&s;s prohibited by legal authority, they ge|nerally go with its implyed con&s;ent. In the la&s;t, which was the ca&s;e of the <HI>Trojans</HI> after the de&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> they go under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity which is &s;uperior to all law. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es then, but e&s;pecially the two
<PB N="84" REF="112">fir&s;t, they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to relinqui&s;h their claim to any of the rights and privileges of the country from which they go, nor yet to have forfeited it. No; however remote, they &s;till continue &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kingdom, and unle&s;s &s;pecially relinqui&s;hed, intituled to all the liberties, privileges, and immunities of that country, of which they form one or more of the con&s;tituent parts. If this be as true in fact as it is grateful in &s;uppo&s;ition, the analogy made by an eminent writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dr. Strahan's Preface to Domat's Civil Law.</NOTE> between the <HI>American</HI> colonies and tho&s;e of <HI>Spain,</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;ettled upon the &s;ame principles, and therefore to be governed by the &s;ame policy, mu&s;t appear very &s;trange. But the principle upon which it is founded, is as erroneous as the con&s;equence deduced from it is derogatory to ENGLISH LIBERTY.</P>
<P>The AMERICAN COLONIES have been entire|&s;ettled by tho&s;e who came under the immedi|ate protection and countenance of the govern|ment, or fled to it as an a&s;ylum from arbi|trary and oppre&s;&s;ive power. A due con&s;ider|ation of the rights they claim, and the duties they owe to the mother country, may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary in &s;ome degree to a&s;certain with pre|ci&s;ion the advantages that will accrue from a
<PB N="85" REF="113">compleat, and perfect Union. The&s;e <HI>rights</HI> and <HI>duties</HI> are RECIPROCAL, as well as the Intere&s;t which ari&s;es from them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Rights</HI> we claim are the <HI>full</HI> and <HI>free</HI> enjoyment of CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY, PROTECTION from foreign inva&s;ions, and <HI>en|couragement</HI> in every <HI>commercial intere&s;t,</HI> which does not directly interfere with that of the mother country.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Duties</HI> we owe, are OBEDIENCE under <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> re&s;trictions, and an exclu&s;ive preference to the mother country in every article of commerce and trade. Under one or other of the&s;e heads, however widely diffu&s;ed, may be comprized every duty, either owing to or from the mother country. And and it is by a due and mutual ob&s;ervance of the&s;e only, that their re&s;pective and reciprocal intere&s;ts can be promoted. From this ju&s;t and wi&s;e policy will flow all tho&s;e advantages which render a clo&s;e and perfect Union &s;o de|&s;irable an object&mdash;and the&s;e may be con&s;ider|ed either as they tend to increa&s;e the power and glory of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or as they ad|vance its grand commercial intere&s;t, and
<PB N="86" REF="114">become the channels of its wealth. Or with regard to the Colonies, as they conduce to their &s;afety, nouri&s;hment and protection; for though the true riches of a nation are &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the number of its inhabitants, and trea&s;ures are called the &s;inews of war, it is very certain a nation may be very poor, and very powerful at the &s;ame time; or abound with wealth, and yet be weak and impotent. <HI>Rome,</HI> in its early ages, was poor in every thing but the public &s;pirit and bravery of her people, while &s;he was the dread and terror of the nations round her. And <HI>Spain</HI> is at pre&s;ent a lively in&s;tance that wealth and power are not in&s;eparable; who, as the trea&s;ures of the <HI>Indies</HI> have flowed in upon her, has lo&s;t the martial animated &s;pirit of her ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>As &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kingdom, bearing allegiance to the &s;ame Prince, and controuled by the &s;ame executive power, the <HI>Americans</HI> are bound to contribute, in proportion to their numbers and abilities, to the defence and &s;afety of the common cau&s;e. What an acce&s;&s;ion of power to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire then is three millions of &s;ubjects, dutiful, loyal and brave, who have on many occa&s;ions
<PB N="87" REF="115">di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, and &s;hewn they were not unworthy the glorious &s;tock from which they &s;prung; who intere&s;t them&s;elves in the honour and glory of the nation, and partake of the veneration and re&s;pect due to it?</P>
<P>HERE is a fund of hardy, brave &s;oldiers, inured to fatigue and frugality, ready to engage in the &s;ervice of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> when|ever &s;he thinks proper to require them. From this fruitful, this increa&s;ing &s;ource, her armies and navies may receive con&s;tant &s;upplies, not of mercenary hierlings ready to engage in the &s;ervice of the highe&s;t bidder, but faithful, dutiful children, animated with becoming fortitude, freedom and loyalty. The&s;e, if encouraged, cheri&s;hed and protect|ed, will indeed prove</P>
<Q>"Of <HI>Britain</HI>'s empire the &s;upport and &s;trength."
<BIBL><HI>Thomp&s;on.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>IN order to make a colony of the mo&s;t u&s;e and benefit to the mother country, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that its climate, its &s;oil, and natural
<PB N="88" REF="116">produce, &s;hould be e&s;&s;entially different from hers. This will create a nece&s;&s;ary connection and dependance between them. The Inter|changing the commodities and produce of the one, for tho&s;e of the other, will not only de&s;troy the heart-burnings and jealou&s;y of a competition, but produce an intercour&s;e equally beneficial and durable to both. It is happy, therefore, when the &s;ubjects of <HI>Com|merce</HI> cannot be the &s;ame, as they thereby reap an advantage, from which other nations are excluded, who might either by with|holding di&s;tre&s;s them, or rai&s;e the ballance again&s;t them when their nece&s;&s;ities were not mutual and equal. In this re&s;pect, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is peculiarly happy in her Colonies, who&s;e wide extent and different &s;ituations in|clude a variety of climates, &s;oils and produce, and thus form a proper ba&s;is for the com|mercial intere&s;t, to which every other con|&s;ideration &s;hould &s;ubmit. The i&s;lands produce commodities which the mother country mu&s;t u&s;e, and yet cannot rai&s;e; the&s;e therefore &s;he mu&s;t procure by an intercour&s;e with her co|lonies, or lie at the mercy of tho&s;e powers who&s;e intere&s;t it might occa&s;ionally be to
<PB N="89" REF="117">di&s;tre&s;s her. But what adds to the ad|vantage is, that the &s;ubjects of commerce are not only ea&s;ily procured, but procured by a mutual exchange, equally convenient and &s;atisfactory to both; and at the &s;ame time a large revenue &s;ecured, not only upon the home con&s;umption, but on the &s;urplus be|yond their re&s;pective wants and nece&s;&s;ities. Thus al&s;o, as to the continent, <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> both as a naval and commercial nation, would be in a critical, dangerous &s;ituation, if &s;he did not hold within her own reach, all the materials nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of both. An intire dependance upon any of her neigh|bours for one nece&s;&s;ary article would, in &s;ome degree, make her &s;ubject to that neighbour. But her Colonies &s;et her above every appre|hen&s;ion of this kind. Her <HI>Northern</HI> provinces abound with timber of every kind, nece&s;&s;ary for building and equipping her navies. Im|men&s;e bodies of Ore, both Iron and Copper, are already di&s;covered and u&s;efully employ|ed; and, doubtle&s;s, much more lies &s;till con|cealed in the bowels of the earth, who&s;e &s;oil, it properly cultivated and encouraged, is richly productive of Hemp and Flax; for
<PB N="90" REF="118">the former of which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> pays, <HI>com|munibus annis,</HI> &pound;. 300,000 &s;terling. Her more <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies furni&s;h her with the few remaining marine articles of Pitch, Tar and Turpentine.</P>
<P>HERE then are found all the materials of Timber, Iron, Cordage, and every other &s;pe|cies of Naval Stores, nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport, nay, the exi&s;tence of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> as a ma|ritime power. Should I here mention bodies of Saltpetre, the &s;pontaneous produce of the earth, I may perhaps be thought too pre|mature; but if the promi&s;ing appearances of that u&s;eful and expen&s;ive, but necc&s;&s;ary com|modity, be happily confirmed, here is a new &s;ource of national wealth and independance. A large and con&s;tant ballance, which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> pays to the <HI>Indies</HI> in &s;pecie, will be in&s;tantly &s;aved, and a &s;urer, quicker, and cheaper &s;upply at once &s;ecured. Next to the &s;ubjects of COmmerce, which are nece&s;|&s;ary to enable the mother country to main|tain her independance and rank among the other powers or <HI>Europe,</HI> we may place all the&s;e, which are articles of convenience, Luxury, and the &s;urplus of tho&s;e com|modities
<PB N="91" REF="119">which are not applied to naval purpo&s;es. The real and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life are but few, the &s;ubjects of Com|merce are many and various, as they contri|bute not only to the real, but the imaginary, capricious wants, of mankind. To provide therefore again&s;t the&s;e wants, upon advan|tageous terms, is a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary policy; and there are few, very few, of the&s;e articles, which the coloni&s;ts cannot furni&s;h, under proper encouragements. The i&s;lands tender the various produce of their climate equal in quantity and quality with tho&s;e of their neigh|bours. The <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies of <HI>North-America</HI> have, as far as the infancy of the country will permit, produced the different articles of Silk, Rice, Indigo, Tobacco, and even the Tea plant has not been altogether uncultivated. Some of the&s;e have been car|ried to a much greater degree of cultivation than others; but where it has, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has received a proportionate benefit. In the in&s;tance of Tobacco only, &s;he has become not only the &s;ole vender, but almo&s;t the &s;ole ma|nufacturer for <HI>Europe,</HI> be&s;ides the immen&s;e revenue flowing immediately into her ex|chequer.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="120">WINES are an article of luxury, and it is perhaps upon that account they have not been &s;o much attended to by the frugal, temperate <HI>American;</HI> but it is certain, not only from theory, but experience, that the &s;ituation and &s;oil of many parts of this ex|tended continent, are well adapted for pro|ducing them. To what degree of perfection not only the cultivation of the&s;e, but the other articles of convenience and luxury may arrive, is difficult to determine; but it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the great, the eventual profit, will terminate in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I mentioned before the produce of the Colonies as Naval Stores, but con&s;idered as the raw materials of great and exten&s;ive manufactories, which give bread to thou&s;ands; and of idle, clamorous &s;tarving &s;ubjects, make u&s;eful and indu&s;trious citizens, I cannot err, when I &s;ay they are immen&s;ely u&s;eful to their mother country. Upon a view of the foreign trade of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we &s;hall find, that except that to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the ballance is again&s;t her in every one. To <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to <HI>Sweden,</HI> to <HI>Denmark,</HI> to <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;he pays annually large &s;ums in &s;pecie, for tho&s;e very commodities which her <HI>American</HI> Colonies can and do produce; and a great writer has ob&s;erved, <Q>That a country
<PB N="93" REF="121">which con&s;tantly exports fewer manufac|tures or commodities than it receives, will &s;oon find the ballance &s;inking, will re|ceive le&s;s and le&s;s, till falling into extreme poverty, it will receive nothing at all.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then we may trace the great utility of the Colonies, not only that they afford a con|&s;tant and &s;ure &s;upply of the &s;ubjects of com|merce, nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the power and manufactures of the mother country, but in that &s;he has an indi&s;putable exclu&s;ive preference in the &s;ale of them; and the Colo|nies in return are the fixed and con&s;tant cu&s;tomers for all her manufactures and com|modities, to which they are indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to give the preference over tho&s;e of other countries; for as the de&s;ign of colo|nizing was not to found a new empire, but to extend the old, there is no impropriety in appropriating the trade of the Colonies to the mother country only. If the ballance was therefore in favour of Colonies, as is the ca&s;e between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> it would be more eligible it &s;hould fall into the hands of its own &s;ubjects, however remote, than into tho&s;e of a foreign power. But where that ballance is actually and
<PB N="94" REF="122">greatly in favour of the mother country, it becomes an intere&s;t that ought to be very dear; to the cultivating of which, the greate&s;t care and attention of government &s;hould be applied. That this is the ca&s;e of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her continential Colonies, the va&s;t exportation of bullion, and the &s;till remain|ing debt of five millions, mo&s;t evidently evince. With what a rapid, a&s;toni&s;hing pro|gre&s;s, this beneficial, this lucrative trade has advanced, the growing increa&s;e of the ex|ports declare, which aro&s;e from the Year 1744, from &pound;. 1,436,227, to the amazing amount of &pound;. 2,710,520. To this the mo|ther country, in a great mea&s;ure, owes her con|tinuance as a trading nation, when deprived of her valuable Levant trade and her inter|cour&s;e even with <HI>Portugal</HI> greatly dimini&s;hed, and le&s;&s;ened by her active indu&s;trious rivals, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> It is from this foun|tain tho&s;e trea&s;ures flow, which enable her to pay the re&s;pective ballances to tho&s;e countries with whom &s;he trades, on a di&s;advantageous footing. <HI>America,</HI> it is true, does not extract them immediately from her own bowels. She has a more valuable and durable re&s;ource, in
<PB N="95" REF="123">in the labour and indu&s;try of her inhabitants; who exchange the &s;urplus of their commodi|ties, beyond their own con&s;umption, (and which might, in &s;ome re&s;pects, interfere with the &s;taples of the mother country, or at lea&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s to her) for tho&s;e trea&s;ures which are only valuable to the coloni&s;ts, as they enable them to di&s;charge pa&s;t, and contract future engagements for the manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE, therefore, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a market, which &s;he can call <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> her own, &s;ubject to her own regulations, and the ballance always in her favour; whatever the Colonies may acquire from any collateral branches of trade, will quickly flow to the mother coun|try, as the great centre of all their external pro&s;its. To re&s;train, therefore, or rather &s;top up tho&s;e channels of remittance, is, in effect, to prohibit the con&s;umption of the manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as our de&s;ires to procure them have at all times been equal to, and &s;ometimes exceed, our ability to pay for them. Whence it follows, that a policy which en&s;ures a &s;mall immediate revenue, at the expence of a great, though indirect
<PB N="96" REF="124">national gain, is mean and &s;ordid, unworthy the noble enterprizing &s;pirit of a commercial nation.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould leave this &s;ubject very imper|fect indeed, if I &s;hould omit two great funds of national wealth and power, the FISHERIES and the FUR-TRADE. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a mine richer than that of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> and more inexhau&s;tible. For while our Fi&s;heries &s;erve as a great &s;ubject of commerce, they are al&s;o a fruitful nur&s;ery of brave, hardy &s;eamen, trained up to fatigue, to difficulty and danger.</P>
<P>THE FUR-TRADE, which is now &s;ecured almo&s;t beyond the reach of accident, is dou|bly valuable, as it is enjoyed &s;olely and ex|clu&s;ively &mdash;an advantage which is not confined to a monopoly of the raw materials, and en|hances their price only, but enables <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be both the merchant, and the manufacturer al&s;o, and that upon her own terms; while other nations mu&s;t depend up|on a precarious uncertain &s;upply, which which may either be rai&s;ed in its price, or totally withheld, as the fluctuating policy of intere&s;t or friend&s;hip &s;hall require. This
<PB N="97" REF="125">acqui&s;ition is not only valuable, as it will probably revive a langui&s;hing, dying manu|factory, but as it is a pre&s;ent, an actual, and con&s;iderable &s;ource of revenue, both on the home con&s;umption, and al&s;o on that of foreigners.</P>
<P>THESE are a few of the principal advantages with which a proper cultivation, e&s;tabli&s;hment and tender regard of the Colonies may be attended to the mother country. She has likewi&s;e many inferior ones. The re&s;idence of tho&s;e of affluent fortunes who may be led thi|ther by veiws of education, or mere curio&s;ity is not altogether unworthy regard. The&s;e all depend on, and can only flow from a perfect compleat Union&mdash;by &s;upporting that relati|on&s;hip between the Mother country and her Colonies, which has planted in their bo&s;oms &s;o &s;trong and lively an affection, as to di&s;|tingui&s;h <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by the tender endear|ing appellation of HOME.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis time now that we &s;hould turn to the COLONIES and &s;ee what advantages they may propo&s;e to them&s;elves from a dutiful and affectionate UNION with the mother country; and from our pa&s;t feelings we &s;hall readily
<PB N="98" REF="126">acknowledge we &s;tand in need of her protec|tion, nurture and care. Expo&s;ed by our &s;ituation, by a rival&s;hip and competition of Intere&s;ts, and yet in a &s;tate of infancy, it would be extremely difficult, if not impo&s;|&s;ible, to form any Union among our&s;elves that would be &s;ufficient to repel the attacks of a formidable invader. In this weak, this defencele&s;s &s;tate, therefore, we mu&s;t look up to our indulgent parent, who&s;e vigorous, &s;alutary aid we have &s;o often already expe|rienced. Upon her we mu&s;t rely for &s;upport, and under her wing &s;helter our&s;elves again&s;t any attempts of tho&s;e, who&s;e principles and government are incompatible with our Re|ligion and Liberty. A &s;eparation would be attended with certain ruin to the Colonies, in thier pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as they mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily fall a prey to one or other of tho&s;e powers, who would &s;natch with eagerne&s;s &s;o tempting a prize.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t principle of nature, &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, therefore, dictates to the Colonies, a &s;teady, a &s;trict adherence to the mother coun|try, as upon that depends the enjoyment of every invaluable privilege of a civil or religi|ous nature. But we may not only con&s;ider her
<PB N="99" REF="127">as the protector, but as the nur&s;ing mother of her Colonies. Arts, Sciences, Agriculture and Commerce, ri&s;e by &s;low degrees, and are long before they arrive to any degree of per|fection. They are not of quick or &s;pon|taneous growth. They mu&s;t be planted, cheri&s;hed and encouraged. And have we not experienced the tenderne&s;s of our mother country in this re&s;pect, by her bounties di&s;|per&s;ed not only in public channels, but by private &s;ocieties and patriotic individuals? Have we not rea&s;on to expect a continuance and perhaps an increa&s;e of her benevolent efforts in our behalf? Thus taking our enter|prizing genius by the hand, and leading it on in the paths of indu&s;try and u&s;eful im|provements.</P>
<P>To turn the attention of the Colonies to the cultivation of tho&s;e &s;ubjects of Commerce which the mother country does not, or can|not produce, tho' to her it may be eventually profitable, is to the Colonies immediately and directly &s;o; and when it is done by mild, by bountiful mea&s;ures, de&s;erves our gratitude and thankful returns. A fixed and perma|nent UNION between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ervation
<PB N="100" REF="128">of the peace and harmony of their internal admini&s;tration. For to form the con&s;titution and plan of a new government, or even to new model and revi&s;e the old, is no ea&s;y or incon&s;iderable ta&s;k. That of the mother country has been the work of ages; and, to u&s;e the words of an eminent writer, &s;eems dictated by wi&s;dom it&s;elf. While, therefore, the coloni&s;ts can enjoy all the ble&s;|&s;ings of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution undimini&s;hed and uninterrupted, it would be &s;uperlative madne&s;s and folly to run the ri&s;k of a change, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be for the better, and might be infinitely wor&s;e. Unconnected and divided as they are at pre&s;ent, both in &s;ituation and intere&s;t (owing to the difference of Settlement, of Charters, of Religion, and Commerce, which are often cla&s;hing) how difficult, and next to impo&s;&s;ible, would it be to re&s;cue them from a &s;tate of anarchy; and form a con&s;titution, for which I will venture to &s;ay from the extent of <HI>America,</HI> there can no precedent be found; a con&s;titution which at the &s;ame time that it reconciles the&s;e jar|ring intere&s;ts, mu&s;t pre&s;erve every religious and civil Liberty intire?</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="129">THE difficulties of an Union for the purpo&s;es of empire, are almo&s;t in&s;uperable. To canton out the provinces into petty independent kingdoms, be&s;ides the arduous ta&s;k of &s;ettling the internal police, would &s;ubject them not only to perpetual quarrels with each other, but render them an ea&s;y prey to &s;ome foreign power, as they would &s;ingly be weak, though united under one head, truly formidable. The only remaining re&s;ource of de&s;perate di&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t be to form the provinces into di&s;tricts, having full power of legi&s;lation within them&s;elves&mdash;but &s;ubject to the con|troul of &s;ome &s;upreme, &s;uperintendant au|thority rai&s;ed out of the collective body, as in &s;ome in&s;tances in <HI>Germany,</HI> or with more probability like <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Switzerland.</HI> But this the va&s;t extent of the Colonies will render almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, as it would give being to an ari&s;tocracy&mdash;a kind of government as re|pugnant to the genius and temper of <HI>America,</HI> as de&s;potic monarchy.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE repeat it, that the pre&s;er|vation of our laws, commerce, and every other ble&s;&s;ing of dome&s;tic peace, by the wi&s;e policy of the mother country, can only be made the ba&s;is of a clo&s;e and firm connection between her and them.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="130">NEXT to the &s;ecurity of a &s;tate, its wealth and convenience are to be regarded, and to judge how beneficial <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is to the Colonies in this re&s;pect, it may be proper to remark, that as other countries produce the &s;ame commodities, and have hitherto been able to under&s;ell the <HI>Americans</HI> in a variety of articles, wherever an exclu&s;ive, or even a pre|ferable market has been given to the latter, the advantage mu&s;t be obvious. This has been done in many in&s;tances by prohibitions, or by duties charged on &s;uch commodities as interfered with tho&s;e from the Colonies, which in &s;ome ca&s;es amount to a prohibition. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Whale Fi&s;hery has been almo&s;t wholly given up, in favour of the <HI>American</HI> Fi&s;heries. Sugars, Hemp, Indigo and Tobacco, be&s;ides a variety of other articles from the Colo|nies, have met with every mark of encourage|ment, while the &s;ame commodities from other countries have been di&s;countenanced, or whol|ly prohibited. This is wi&s;e and ju&s;t policy in the mother country, at the &s;ame time that it di&s;covers a tender regard to her children, and makes it their intere&s;t to unite more clo&s;ely. In &s;hort they have every thing that can make a nation great, happy and power|ful to hope from a Union, every thing that is dangerous to fear from a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="131"><HI>"Divide et impera,"</HI> was the <HI>Roman</HI> mot|to. May it not be applicable to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>American</HI> Colonies, who, if united, have proved them&s;elves equal, nay &s;uperior to two of the principal powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> but if divided, if &s;truggling with in|te&s;tine commotions and civil di&s;cord, I fear will prove unable to contend with either. This, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a great and eminent friend of the Colonies, is the <HI>grand</HI> FAMILY COMPACT, which mu&s;t be cemented by every tie of duty, loyalty and affection from the Provinces, and every mark of kind protecting tenderne&s;s from the mother coun|try. A fatal, under&s;cerning policy had almo&s;t &s;napt the&s;e intere&s;ting cords a&s;under, never perhaps to have been clo&s;ed again; but the guardian genius of <HI>Britain</HI> and of <HI>America</HI> &s;tept between them and ruin, and with out|&s;tretched hand &s;aved a &s;inking nation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> decreed a crown to him who &s;aved the life of a citizen in battle; but what crowns or &s;tatues can do &s;ufficient honour to the Man or Men who &s;ave a country, a king|dom, in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, and re&s;cue a fal|ling &s;tate from the brink of ruin? <HI>Rome</HI> may ju&s;tly boa&s;t her <HI>Brutus</HI>'s, her <HI>Curtius</HI>'s, her
<PB N="104" REF="132"><HI>Cato</HI>'s and her <HI>Tully</HI>'s &mdash; they were the PITTS, the <HI>Conways</HI> and the <HI>Barres</HI> of that age, alike warmed by the &s;acred fire of <HI>Liberty,</HI> alike crowned with Immortality, and handed down to po&s;terity the wonder and delight of ad|miring nations.

<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINSON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></BYLINE>
<P>_AT this important juncture, when the eyes of all <HI>America</HI> are lifted to the mother country in anxious expectation; when trembling fear or bold defiance, enlivening hope or my&s;teri|ous &s;urmi&s;e, di&s;tract every brea&s;t and &s;it in every brow; what &s;ubject can be more inte|re&s;ting than the "Reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies"? and yet there is no &s;ubject, perhaps, which the public is &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to receive with candour, and judge of with impartiality. How then &s;hall a native of <HI>America,</HI> and an unexperienced writer, e&s;|pecially in matters of &s;uch high importance, pre&s;ume to draw his pen? But the worthy Gentleman who has propo&s;ed this &s;ubject, and back'd his propo&s;al with the reward of di&s;tingui&s;hed honour, has rai&s;ed in us who are
<PB N="106" REF="134">candidates on this occa&s;ion, that ambition which hath, in all ages, prompted men to greater undertakings than cooler judgement would have &s;uffered them to engage in.</P>
<P>I Do not mean, in this <HI>little E&s;&s;ay,</HI> to cal|culate the advantages of <HI>trade</HI> between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, in order to &s;hew that they are <HI>reciprocal.</HI> By the very nature of Commerce they mu&s;t be &s;o. There is no country in the world that exports &s;taple com|modities or manufactures, but for an advantage to be gained; or imports them, but for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As the God of nature has adapted different countries to abound in different kinds of pro|duce, or excell in various u&s;eful arts; it is evident, that a commercial intercour&s;e mu&s;t redound to the benefit of the whole. But how mu&s;t this advantage be increa&s;ed when we con&s;ider that <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in her trade with her Colonies, does not &s;upport a foreign peo|ple, who&s;e religion, politics and cu&s;toms are different from her own; but &s;he &s;upports and nouri&s;hes her own offspring, at the &s;ame time that &s;he enriches her&s;elf by the natural profits of an exten&s;ive trade; and &s;he &s;trengthens her&s;elf by protecting and encouraging her own religion, government and cu&s;toms, tran&s;|planted to <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="135">COMMERCE between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, is like the whole&s;ome food which a man eats. He cannot &s;ay, his head, his hands or his feet, are more particularly bene|fited by it; but the finer parts thereof circu|late through the whole body, and the whole body is nouri&s;hed and &s;upported.</P>
<P>THE three grand objects worthy the atten|tion of a wi&s;e people, are the &s;tate of their <HI>Commerce, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> If the <HI>Com|merce,</HI> the <HI>Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> both of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies can alone be &s;up|ported and &s;trengthened by a clo&s;e and la&s;ting Union between them, then the <HI>reciprocal ad|vantages</HI> of &s;uch an UNION mu&s;t be &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;lightly touched the fir&s;t of the&s;e. There have been &s;o many accurate mercantile calculations made in almo&s;t every pamphlet that has been lately publi&s;hed on the &s;ubject, that I take it for granted, as a truth univer&s;ally admitted, that the advantages of trade between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies are reciprocal.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to <HI>political Liberty,</HI> &s;hould it not be the glory of <HI>England</HI> to tran&s;plant, to water and carefully to nur&s;e, even in a
<PB N="108" REF="136">di&s;tant land, a &s;y&s;tem of government which is the admiration of the world; and &s;hould not <HI>America</HI> adopt, and chearfully &s;ubmit to &s;uch a government? Were it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with an high and arbitrary hand, to think of &s;natching from her Colonies the e&s;&s;ential privileges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and yet would have them &s;ubmit as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to her government, and bear only the name and ap|pearance of the free-born &s;ons of Liberty; it would be to dre&s;s her &s;laves in livery, and deck <HI>America</HI> in robes of paper, to make her the contempt and deri&s;ion of every other nation. On the other hand, &s;hould the Colonies, with ba&s;e ingratitude, attempt to throw off all dependance on the mother country, they would put them&s;elves in the &s;ituation of a &s;illy girl, who leaves the guidance and pro|tection of a wi&s;e and affectionate parent, and wandering away expo&s;es her&s;elf to ruin by the artful in&s;inuations of every wicked and de&s;igning &s;tranger. But why &s;hould the mutual connection between the parent|country and her Colonies ever come into que&s;tion? Are we not one nation and one people? And do we not own obedience to
<PB N="109" REF="137">one common King? Tho&s;e who adopt the &s;ame religion, the &s;ame plans of government, and the &s;ame cu&s;toms, are undoubtedly of the &s;ame nation. Different climates and dif|ferent &s;oils mark out countries, but not nations. We of <HI>America,</HI> are in all re&s;pects <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> notwith&s;tanding that the <HI>Atlantic</HI> rolls her waves between us and the throne to which we all own allegiance. Nor can we, though in ever &s;o flouri&s;hing a &s;tate, throw off our dependance, or di&s;&s;olve this <HI>Union,</HI> with|out breaking the very bonds of nature. As well might the branch &s;ay unto the trunk, See how I glow with blo&s;&s;oms and wave with foliage: I have no further need of thy &s;ap, keep it for thy own nouri&s;hment!</P>
<P>ON the other hand, does not <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by tran&s;planting her con&s;titution into <HI>America,</HI> as a &s;cion from the &s;tock, propagate her own likene&s;s? Nay, does &s;he not make unto her|&s;elf another crown and another &s;ceptre?</P>
<P>IN all attacks that &s;hall be made upon <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by the numerous rivals of her power, and enemies to her pro&s;perity; her colonies, like a number of dutiful and pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="110" REF="138">children, growing up round her, will more and more add to her &s;trength, and contribute to her importance. And &s;hould it ever happen, amid the revolution of things human, that tho&s;e enemies &s;hould prevail again&s;t her, what could her &s;ons lo&s;e but the beautiful i&s;land they have &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? Even in that ca&s;e (which we tru&s;t and believe will never happen) they might find in the Colonies a &s;ure a&s;ylum; thither they might remove with all the noble privileges of their con&s;titution, as to a people and coun|try they can call their own; and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> throne might yet &s;hine with undimini&s;hed glory even in the pre&s;ent wilds of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY, with re&s;pect to the religious li|berties of the people of <HI>England,</HI> how precious they are, let the price which has been paid for them declare &mdash; And the&s;e will be as much &s;trengthened by a perpetual <HI>Union</HI> with the colonies, as their civil liberties.</P>
<P>BUT exclu&s;ive of this con&s;ideration, it cer|tainly mu&s;t be the glory of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to propagate, protect and encourage in her co|lonies that &s;acred &s;y&s;tem of religious truth
<PB N="111" REF="139">which &s;he holds &s;o dear. Indeed that &s;he her&s;elf judges in this manner is evident from her many charitable donations for promoting the intere&s;t of learning and virtue in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Prote&s;tant Religion, and par|ticularly that excellent branch of it the na|tional Church of England, is the pure and healthful air in which the political con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> moves and breathes with health and vigour; religious Liberty being hereby fixed on as firm and broad a ba&s;is as Civil Liberty; both of which are &s;o e&s;&s;entially interwoven with the nature of her govern|ment, that it cannot be admini&s;tered without them. Nor can her empire be more effec|tually &s;trengthened, than by extending with it whatever &s;he finds valuable in her own po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. This is her intere&s;t, and it mu&s;t be her honour, as it is likewi&s;e the intere&s;t and honour of the Colonies to receive, nouri&s;h and join with her in the &s;upport of every thing of this kind, which can only be done by a perpetual Union between them.</P>
<P>How dete&s;table then mu&s;t the politician be, who &s;hall ever attempt to kindle the de|&s;tructive
<PB N="112" REF="140">flames of jealou&s;y between two friends, whom nature &s;eems to have united in the clo&s;e&s;t bonds, and who&s;e hearts and in|tere&s;ts are and ever ought to be one? Should any one ever &s;ucceed in this (which God for|bid) I doubt not but that after much cruel contention and unnatural blood&s;hed, each would ru&s;h into the other's arms, and em|phatically cry out, "We are both in the wrong."</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject might be expanded into vo|lumes, and no doubt will be; but I leave the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it to more able hands; and humbly hope this <HI>little E&s;&s;ay</HI> will be accepted as the oblation of one who intimately feels the importance of this great truth, that "a perpetual Union between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies will ever be reciprocally ad|vantageous."</P>
