<P>FROM this temporary death I was at la&s;t recalled by a &s;ound that made me wi&s;h it had been indeed eternal; the voice, the tremendous voice of Williams. Of what horrors was my &s;oul in&s;tantly &s;u&s;ceptible! What dreadful images &s;wam before tho&s;e eyes I hardly dur&s;t open! Fearfully at length I ca&s;t them around&mdash;I &s;aw I had been conveyed into the great room of our Rece&s;s; &s;acred once to piety and inno|cence, but now, alas! the &s;helter of ra|pine, perhaps murder. A number of ill-looking
<PB N="2" REF="4">
ruffians &s;tood ready to fulfil the wor&s;t commands of their ferocious confe|derate, who with malignant joy contem|plated two hopele&s;s victims unpitying heaven &s;eemed to have delivered entirely to his vengeance. I gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t&mdash;<HI>my&s;elf</HI>&mdash;I alike gave up Lord Lei|ce&s;ter; who thus di&s;armed and &s;urrounded, collected his &s;oul in &s;ilence, and re&s;umed the maje&s;tic air which once could awe even this villain to &s;ubordination. I every where perceived a variety of in&s;truments, namele&s;s to me, which I con&s;idered as the means of torture and of death; and only &s;upplicated the Almighty to &s;pare us the fir&s;t, &s;ince to avoid the latter I &s;uppo&s;ed a fruitle&s;s prayer.</P>
<P>You &s;ee at la&s;t, cried the exulting vil|lain, fortune's wheel has made its circle, and my turn is come, Lord Leice&s;ter.&mdash; How could you hope to conquer a man who&s;e all was courage? Neither Sir Fran|cis, nor Elizabeth her&s;elf, could long con|fine him who dares precipitate him&s;elf into the ocean in &s;earch of freedom; not,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
added he in an ironical tone, that I &s;hall fail to requite my obligation.</P>
<P>Lord Leice&s;ter replied but with a look; a look &s;o &s;uperior, contemptuous, and collected, that it wrought the rage of Wil|liams to a &s;till higher pitch; who turned towards me, malignity burning in every &s;car of his horrid face, "you are welcome home, fair lady, continued he, though your vi&s;it is an unexpected favor, without the idle train too which once attended this idle favorite. You &s;ee we have made a little free with your hallowed man&s;ion, but the &s;aints take all in good part. Do you not enquire after your fo&s;ter-father? he would tell us no tales, nor will he ever now tell you one." Oh, Anthony, I &s;hud|dered for thee, thou venerable, murdered friend, in &s;ilence! "Mon&s;ter, bur&s;t &s;orth Lord Leice&s;ter, ha&s;t thou with unexam|pled cruelty butchered an Anchorite?" "I always work &s;afely, returned he; <HI>you</HI> have only &s;aved me the trouble, for never would I have re&s;ted 'till by &s;ome artifice I had drawn you once more hither, and
<PB N="4" REF="6">
God, you &s;ee, mo&s;t graciou&s;ly has &s;ent you."</P>
<P>Bla&s;pheme not thy Maker, oh cruel wretch, &s;ighed I in a tremulous accent; ju&s;t, though &s;evere, are all his ordina|tions; and lo, with &s;ad &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I take the death appointed me even from thy hands.</P>
<P>No, cried he, though you are not the haughty beauty I adored, yet, as the wife of that imperious lord, you become but a more perfect means of exqui&s;ite revenge.</P>
<P>The nature of that revenge blazed in his eyes&mdash;my heart turned to marble within me. I rai&s;ed my eyes towards hea|ven in &s;peechle&s;s agony, and rivetting them on Lord Leice&s;ter, found life recede too fa&s;t for my ear to di&s;tingui&s;h one word of that bitter indignation which the voice it loved &s;o loudly uttered.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t doubted whether my &s;en&s;es were indeed returned when I found my&s;elf in|volved in impenetrable darkne&s;s. The piercing &s;igh of &s;ome one near me was the only &s;ound that broke the &s;tillne&s;s of the night. "If, cried I in a feeble tone, that
<PB N="5" REF="7">
is the voice to which my heart was born to vibrate, oh tell me, beloved Leice&s;ter, whether the &s;cene which yet &s;wims before my &s;ight was real or a vi&s;ion?" "Gra|cious heaven! returned he in a voice yet more piercing, you breathe again, my &s;oul's be&s;t trea&s;ure! the long, long faint|ing cau&s;ed by the threats of that execrable mon&s;ter, gave me hopes you had finally e&s;caped a fate too horrid for reflection. Oh dire extreme of de&s;pair and mi&s;ery when I am condemned to wi&s;h you dead! and yet what el&s;e can deliver you?&mdash;yet think not, Matilda, I fear to follow;&mdash;ah no! the be&s;t blood burning in this bo&s;om &s;hould joyfully embalm you; but the thoughts of all which may precede that moment, almo&s;t urges me to da&s;h my di&s;tracted brain again&s;t the &s;tones on which I lie, and &s;horten my own &s;uffer|ings, &s;ince hopele&s;s of averting yours." "Call up your fortitude, your rea&s;on, your religion, returned I in a firmer voice, (an emotion which united all tho&s;e &s;enti|ments diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through my frame) dare I accu&s;e the Almighty of inju&s;tice?
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Will he, who fir&s;t gave my helple&s;s inno|cence a hallowed &s;helter within the&s;e walls, ordain they &s;hould prove its tomb? the &s;hades of tho&s;e who reared me will &s;urely ri&s;e in its defence." "Alas, my love, &s;ighed he in a de&s;pairing voice, the&s;e vi|&s;ionary hopes may &s;oothe the mind 'till that &s;ad moment nothing can avert&mdash;have you forgot that even in happier times you hoped nothing from the villain? and is this an hour to expect a change? Re|venge and poverty have &s;eared his &s;oul to all humanity. How, how could it ever e&s;cape my memory, that he was acquainted with the &s;ecret of the Rece&s;s? how, un|der &s;uch uncertainty, dur&s;t I ever venture within it? but &s;hort-&s;ighted man, &s;olely employed in weaving &s;nares for others, too late finds his own feet entangled, and falls an ea&s;y prey to the ignoble. Not &s;atisfied with heading this &s;et of coiners, for &s;uch their apparatus proved them, his daring di&s;po&s;ition breaks forth in acts of plunder and barbarity, and even at this moment he is &s;eeking new victims, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, un&s;ought, tho&s;e he would out of
<PB N="7" REF="9">
the whole world have cho&s;en." "Shall we complain Heaven has quite abandoned us, re&s;umed I, when it has given us but one moment to our&s;elves? Oh, Leice&s;|ter! you have hitherto found me a tender, anxious, fearful woman; but alas, I knew not till now the powers of my own &s;oul&mdash; Abhorrent of &s;hame and di&s;honour, it tempts me to the mo&s;t de&s;perate deeds; if your's is indeed congenial, it &s;urely un|der&s;tands me; a&s;&s;ume a Roman courage, and &s;ave thy wife, thy &s;potle&s;s wife, from horrible pollution." "So much I ago|nize at the idea, cried Lord Leice&s;ter, that were the&s;e hands free, perhaps&mdash;" "and mine too, added I, feeble as they are, alike are bound; yet &s;urely de&s;pair will give me &s;trength to loo&s;e them." The violent efforts I made at la&s;t broke the &s;light thong they thought more than &s;ufficient to confine one in my feeble &s;tate, and encouraged by my &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;ought Lord Leice&s;ter. At the moment I re|&s;tored his liberty, I half revived, while the &s;ole u&s;e the tender Leice&s;ter could make of his arms, was to pre&s;s me a
<PB N="8" REF="10">
thou&s;and times to his &s;welled heart, which almo&s;t bur&s;t with &s;obbing. I &s;truggled again&s;t all the &s;ad tenderne&s;s which throb|bed at mine. "Oh, think no more of love, cried I with increa&s;ing heroi&s;m, it has given place to death&mdash;to wor&s;e than death&mdash;rather imagine you hear this dun|geon once more open,"&mdash;"But can I lift that hand, which pledged it &s;elf for thy protection, again&s;t thy life, thy pre|cious life? groaned he&mdash;can I deface that angel form, which &s;till illumes my &s;oul through all the&s;e complicated horrors? And oh, our dear unborn! for whom we gladly &s;uffered, can I, can I, de&s;troy it?" "Think, think my Life, returned I, we have perhaps this only moment&mdash;had the&s;e wretches left any means of death in my own hands, do you imagine I would &s;upplicate it from yours? Strangle me now, while darkne&s;s favours. Your wife demands of you this final proof of love and courage; her's will at lea&s;t vie with it; no groan, no &s;truggle, &s;hall i&s;&s;ue from a heart which then will return innocent to that du&s;t from which it &s;prung, devoted
<PB N="9" REF="11">
alone to the adored hu&s;band with who&s;e image it is doubly inhabited." "Oh, matchle&s;s, matchle&s;s woman! cried my Lord, flooding my cheek with tears of generous angui&s;h; never, never, can it be; my &s;inews relax to childhood; your unhoped-for fortitude totally &s;ubdues mine, and melts my &s;oul to woman's weakne&s;s.&mdash;Oh! thou who gave&s;t me this angel, can&s;t thou have abandoned her to brutality, and me to di&s;traction!"</P>
<P>A peal of thunder, which &s;hook the ruins to their foundation, &s;eemed to re|prove his boldne&s;s. The livid lightning pervaded our dungeon through many a time-worn aperture. During every tre|mendous illumination I gazed awe-&s;truck on the pallid face of my Love; till &s;uddenly glancing around, I gave a cry which &s;tartled even my&s;elf&mdash;glowing, ga&s;ping, tran&s;ported, yet &s;till unable to &s;peak, I &s;unk before my Lord, and cla&s;ping both his hands, alternately pre&s;t them, to my heart, and lifted them, with mine, to|wards Heaven. "What means my be|loved? exclaimed he, in almo&s;t equal
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;urpri&s;e and agitation, has pitying provi|dence deprived her of her &s;en&s;es?" "Ah no, it is God him&s;elf who has illumined them, faltered I at la&s;t; what dungeon has man yet di&s;covered the Almighty cannot; you have, perhaps, forgot my love, that you have often heard of one communica|tion from the Rece&s;s to the Abbey: clo&s;ed up on the death of Mrs. Marlow, it was never opened after, nor was it known to that horrible villain; this di&s;mal den con|tains it, and we tread on the only &s;pot in the creation which could &s;helter us from tho&s;e ruffians. In the corner on the right hand, covered with lumber, placed long &s;ince on purpo&s;e, you will find a trap door; if you have &s;trength to rai&s;e it, &s;trong fa&s;tenings will &s;ecure it on the other &s;ide, at lea&s;t till we reach the Abbey. Oh thou, added I, devoutly rai&s;ing my eyes, who alone could&s;t pre&s;erve us, con|tinue tho&s;e fla&s;hes, more welcome than ever yet the &s;un was."</P>
<P>Indelibly impre&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ent danger, it was not till we had de&s;cended into the vaults, and fa&s;tened that ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="13">
door between our&s;elves and the banditti, that either recollected what we might ap|prehend at the Abbey. A&s;&s;ured none but an opulent owner could re&s;ide in a &s;eat &s;o &s;plendid, we vainly racked imagination to di&s;cover its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; yet per|&s;uaded even our wor&s;t enemies would re&s;|cue us with plea&s;ure from a peril &s;o near|ly connected with them&s;elves, we were obliged to defy every other. The hou&s;e|keeper's room, into which the pa&s;&s;age led, was empty, yet &s;cattered furniture, &amp;c. indicated inhabitants, I hailed, with true devotion, that power who gave me once more to &s;ee the &s;oft lu&s;tre of the moon, which on the &s;ub&s;iding of the &s;torm dif|fu&s;ed &s;erenity. Retaining in his hand the bar (which had been one fa&s;tening of the Abbey entrance) as the only weapon in his power, Lord Leice&s;ter followed my trembling &s;teps; they turned intuitively to the apartment of Mrs. Marlow; ah that there I could have found her! I pau&s;ed at the door of the anti-chamber, my heart &s;ickened with de&s;pondency; knowing there was an immediate nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="12" REF="14">
for rou&s;ing and arming the whole family, yet convinced we mu&s;t at fir&s;t alarm them as preternatural beings, and afterwards, with the conviction our e&s;cape introduced a danger to them&s;elves, while ignorant whom we were going to appear before, well might the firme&s;t heart tremble. Engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e various and affecting ideas, I hardly heard a &s;ound, which made Lord Leice&s;ter &s;tart forward with an eagerne&s;s, that might ea&s;ily have deprived me of the little &s;trength Heaven had left me. The anti-chamber into which I im|mediately followed him was dark, but in the room beyond I perceived a lights, and heard the voice of a woman apparently &s;upplicating. Scarcely had I di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in that of the man who an&s;wered her, the dreaded Williams, ere I &s;aw Lord Leice&s;ter &s;tart forward, levelling the bar with &s;o de&s;perate a boldne&s;s, that the fall of the villain a&s;certained our &s;afety. In&s;tant|ly &s;natching a knife from the wretch's hand, he pointed it at his bo&s;om, but perceived a perforation in the brain, which made his puni&s;hment terrible, as his guilt
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and his death immediate. "Execrable mon&s;ter, cried my Lord, dropping the knife, by unlooked-for means Heaven at la&s;t has fini&s;hed thee."&mdash;"Gracious God, cried the lady, do I hear the voice of Lord Leice&s;ter!"&mdash;Amazed at this di&s;covery, and the preceding event, hardly could my trembling limbs convey me into the chamber. "Approach, my dear Ma|tilda, cried my Lord, never more &s;hall this wretch appal thee. Eternal ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied with one blow, nor need I turn a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in even to him. Happy at the &s;ame moment in &s;aving this lady, endeavour to intere&s;t her for tho&s;e misfortunes in which &s;he already &s;eems interwoven."&mdash;"Can Lord Leice&s;ter have any misfor|tune in which I am not interwoven? cried the lady; to have received my life from his hands alone could reconcile me to it." Had I not known the &s;peaker by her voice to be the fair Ro&s;e Cecil, &s;uch language mu&s;t have a&s;certained it; yet to find our|&s;elves under the roof of our mo&s;t mortal enemy, was a cruel &s;troke. "Is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be in the hou&s;e of Lord Bur|leigh,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
cried Lord Leice&s;ter, di&s;dainfully?" She, &s;ighing, replied, "he fortunately is ab&s;ent, nor can you ever be un&s;afe in any hou&s;e where I am mi&s;tre&s;s." "You know not to whom you &s;peak, cried I, in turn; alas, Mi&s;s Cecil, do you &s;till remember the friend&s;hip you have &s;o often profe&s;&s;ed for the unfortunate Matilda? Ever has &s;ee lamented the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of veiling her fate from a heart &s;o noble; accept then, at this unexpected moment, that confidence I always longed to place in you, and tell me whether you &s;till can re&s;olve to love her who was the wife of Lord Leice&s;ter, long ere &s;he &s;aw you? her, who at this moment, renders him a fugitive in his own country." Her di&s;|tre&s;sful eyes wandered from him to me for &s;ome moments in &s;ilence, then taking a hand of each, &s;he fir&s;t ki&s;&s;ed, and after|wards uniting them, &s;aid with, a Spartan firmne&s;s, "my friend!" but turning in|&s;tantly from him to hide her glowing cheeks and impa&s;&s;ioned tears in my bo&s;om, &s;obbed out, "my deliverer!" Her beauty (which was rendered more obvious by her di&s;order|ed
<PB N="15" REF="17">
appearance, the ruffian having compelled her to ri&s;e and half dre&s;s her&s;elf) her in|nocence and her genero&s;ity appeared at la&s;t a little to affect Lord Leice&s;ter, who had hitherto &s;hewn her an indifference al|mo&s;t amounting to di&s;gu&s;t. "It remains with you, Madam, returned he in a &s;ofter voice, now to become mine. Mi&s;s Cecil no longer &s;ees the wor&s;hipped favourite of an imperious Queen. United alike by choice and law to the dear companion of my dangers, a chain of occurrences re|duces us to e&s;cape by unknown means from England; and with the utmo&s;t di&s;|patch. Neverthele&s;s, tho&s;e even Eliza|beth's rage might have &s;pared, were only an hour ago devoted by that lifele&s;s vil|lain. E&s;caped this moment almo&s;t from a den of &s;laughter, hardly can we tell whether the banditti, of whom this was the ringleader, are not now &s;urrounding us. Summon all your courage and your dome&s;ticks, and while providing for your own &s;afety, I need not &s;olicit you to re|member ours." "When I forget it, may I be condemned to &s;ee you peri&s;h!" cried
<PB N="16" REF="18">
&s;he. Then turning to me, with that in|nocent candor which eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed her, &s;ought a pardon in my eyes. Collecting all her thoughts, &s;he continued, in a few moments&mdash;"A&s;toni&s;hed as I mu&s;t be, both at your circum&s;tances and your vi&s;it, my noble friends, curio&s;ity yields to friendship. With the morning I expect my father, nor is there any &s;afety for you but immediate flight: neverthe|le&s;s, this danger with which you &s;ay we are environed mu&s;t be the fir&s;t con&s;idera|tion." I then explained to her the &s;ecret of the Rece&s;s; the direful mi&s;take which had thrown us into the power of its pre|&s;ent diabolical tenants, and the de&s;pera|tion which the di&s;covery of our e&s;cape, and the means by which it was effected mu&s;t inevitably cau&s;e: except indeed the lo&s;s of Williams &s;hould abate their fero|city. While I talked, I frequently per|ceived her mind wandered on another &s;ubject: She &s;urveyed the di&s;gui&s;ed per|&s;ons, and pale faces of both my Lord and me, a thou&s;and times over; by fits &s;he &s;hook with horror at the &s;tory I was re|lating,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
and by &s;tarts &s;he forgot I had been &s;peaking, and obliged me to go back in my tale. Employed chiefly in concerting the means of &s;ecuring our &s;afety, her own &s;eemed hardly a con&s;ider|ation. Such is the nature of love in the mind of a virtuous woman. "I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, (when I had fini&s;hed) the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome body's appearing, to account to my &s;ervants for the di&s;covery of the vil|lains. I &s;ee too, that Lord Leice&s;ter can|not be the per&s;on, for who can fail to know him?" The inference thus tenderly conveyed was obvious; one mu&s;t be &s;een, but I could not re&s;olve to be that one without a di&s;may which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed com|plaint. "Yes, my dear Matilda, added &s;he, we mu&s;t part with him for a little time; but you will rejoin him for life. By the ordination of providence, as I could almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;on of my nur&s;e is now in the hou&s;e, a young man over whom that circum&s;tance gives me a powerful influence; again&s;t the choice of his friends he embraced a &s;ea-faring life, till he ac|quired enough money to purcha&s;e a &s;mall
<PB N="18" REF="20">
ve&s;&s;el, with which he trades between the coa&s;t of Devon&s;hire and that of France; but di&s;gu&s;ted at the profe&s;&s;ion he cho&s;e, it was only ye&s;terday he arrived here to &s;olicit my intere&s;t with my father to pro|mote him in a civil line. Say, not then Heaven frowns on your flight, &s;ince it plainly points cut a &s;ecure mode of e&s;cape. I cannot but di&s;cern every avenue to Hol|land mu&s;t be effectually clo&s;ed, but who could think of tracing you to the di&s;tant and ob&s;cure coa&s;t of Devon&s;hire? It is true the journey is long, but to compen|&s;ate for that, you mu&s;t recollect it is &s;afe. The travels of Arthur have been confined to the road by which he conducts you, and his connections are doubtle&s;s among people who will furni&s;h you with every common comfort, without having curio&s;ity, or un|der&s;tanding, to penetrate through the my&s;|tery of your rank. I &s;ee too what your ex|pre&s;&s;ive eyes, my dear Matilda, would point out&mdash;the impo&s;&s;ibility of long concealing the &s;hare I have had in your fate, &s;ince how el&s;e can your miraculous appearance here, or the terrible death of my mid|night
<PB N="19" REF="21">
vi&s;itor be accounted for? but I what of that? &s;he generou&s;ly added, after a moment's pau&s;e, much ought to be ven|tured when our all is at &s;take." "I have expected every moment, &s;aid my Lord, &s;ome dreadful interruption from the re&s;t of the&s;e wretches." "No, returned Mi&s;s Cecil, I have every rea&s;on to imagine he was alone in this enterprize; when fir&s;t, by his entrance, I &s;tarted from the &s;lum|ber into which I was falling, I began col|lecting my pur&s;e, and every ornament near me: he rejected them all, and com|pelling me to ri&s;e, commanded me with terrible imprecations to conduct him to the private cabinet, where my father con|cealed his &s;tate papers: hoping, doubt|le&s;s, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them to obtain many &s;e|crets, which might en&s;ure his own pardon, for that mu&s;t have been his ultimate object. I knew too well the character of my fa|ther, not to debate whether I &s;hould not rather give up my life than a tru&s;t &s;o pre|cious, when the terrible intervention of Lord Leice&s;ter relea&s;ed me from the con|flict. Yet I agree with you, a moment
<PB N="20" REF="22">
ought not to be lo&s;t; and fir&s;t let me lock up the room which contains &s;o &s;hocking a te&s;timony, that more than one man has intruded there at midnight." Con&s;cious of her own merit, &s;he encountered even the eye of Lord Leice&s;ter without tre|mor, who could not but admire in her at that moment all the magnanimity and fore&s;ight which ennobles man, with every &s;ofter grace which half deifies woman.

<P>Lord Leice&s;ter promi&s;ed; and conduct|ing him &s;oftly through the hou&s;e, we reached the door leading to the garden. All the horrors of the pa&s;t were &s;hort of what I felt at that moment. After the dangers I had &s;hared and e&s;caped with my Lord, to &s;ee him depart was to quit my guardian angel, or to deprive him of his: yet convinced Mi&s;s Cecil was actu|ated by the &s;ame fearful affection, I yield|ed my&s;elf up to the de&s;perate emergency and acquie&s;ced. The clo&s;ing of the door

after him &s;evered the hearts of both; it was then only we knew the &s;upport we had derived from his pre&s;ence; wan, &s;peech|le&s;s, helple&s;s, we dur&s;t: hardly turn our eyes on any object, but each other, nor utter a &s;igh but it &s;welled into a groan; and the gha&s;tly body of Williams &s;eemed for ever to impede out foot&s;teps, floating the path with blood. Mi&s;s Cecil took the only po&s;&s;ible method to divert our terrors, and &s;oon rou&s;ing a few terrified dome&s;ticks, commanded them to &s;ummon all the fa|mily: a command which needed no repeti|tion. A few minutes gathered together eigh|teen or twenty men, &s;ufficiently armed to &s;ecure us from any per&s;onal danger. I con|ducted the whole a&s;toni&s;hed body to the private door, through which I had en|tered; I de&s;cribed the place to which it led, and, touching &s;lightly on my own danger and e&s;cape, recommended to them that profound &s;ilence the villains had pre&s;erved towards us with &s;uch fatal &s;uc|ce&s;s. During this time, Mi&s;s Cecil &s;e|lected the man &s;he mentioned to us, and retiring into the next room, gave him
<PB N="23" REF="25">
her orders unob&s;erved; &s;o entirely did both my appearance and &s;trange &s;tory en|gro&s;s the attention of every individual belonging to the family. Mi&s;s Cecil re|joining us, ordered them to divide, and while half remained to guard the hou&s;e, the re&s;t &s;hould de&s;cend, and pa&s;&s;ing into the dungeon from whence I came, wait the return of the banditti, and &s;eize them one by one as they entered. This con|clu&s;ion of the adventure greatly damped the ardour of the group, but a&s;hamed to recede from a place, through which I had apparently e&s;caped alone, they departed in &s;o numerous a body as might almo&s;t fill the den in which I was lately enclo&s;ed, the few who remained hovering near the entrance, &s;olely intent on the event of the enterprize. Arthur, in the interim, having the full command of the &s;tables, made ready two hor&s;es in the manner al|ready mentioned, and Mi&s;s Cecil, with her u&s;ual fore&s;ight, overwhelmed me with refre&s;hments, which a little invigorated my exhau&s;ted frame: nor did &s;he forget to provide Arthur with &s;uch as might re|cruit
<PB N="24" REF="26">
my Lord; &s;electing from her ward|robe, linen, and every nece&s;&s;ary the time and occa&s;ion admitted. Impatiently I expected the &s;ummons to depart, which was preceded by a me&s;&s;age from the Re|ce&s;s, that all was hitherto entirely &s;ilent, and the door fa&s;tened as when we left it, a circum&s;tance which appalled my inmo&s;t &s;oul, as it &s;eemed to leave us &s;till in the reach of the mercile&s;s banditti. With mingled tears of grief and hope, I em|braced that generous friend I never more might &s;ee, and quitting the once ho&s;pi|table man&s;ion, which &s;eemed of all the univer&s;e the only home my heart acknow|ledged, I &s;eated my&s;elf behind a guide, who&s;e &s;un-burnt features &s;oftened into a compa&s;&s;ion, few indeed could at that mo|ment have denied me. The moon &s;hone forth with re&s;plendent lu&s;tre, and our road being in a contrary direction to that which before en&s;nared us, I recommended my|&s;elf to Heaven, and anxiou&s;ly expected the meeting with my Lord. We had not proceeded far when that dear protector (who had in fearful affection for me de|fied
<PB N="25" REF="27">
his own danger, and returned, almo&s;t to the Abbey) &s;tarted from under a clump of trees, and with a voice that di&s;&s;ipated terror, welcomed my return to freedom, and &s;prung upon the hor&s;e our guide be|fore led for him. Such is the effect of an evil e&s;caped, that I almo&s;t forgot my exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, and could have fancied my&s;elf &s;afe.</P>
<P>Recent circum&s;tances at fir&s;t occupied my thoughts, and during the intervals of &s;ilence, the addition of a &s;tranger mu&s;t naturally impo&s;e, my imagination once more returned to the dungeon: it pictured the fear and horror the wretches them|&s;elves mu&s;t in turn feel, when unknown hands condemned them to a fate like that they had allotted to us. Again I wandered to the Court; I &s;eemed to &s;ee Elizabeth burning with embo&s;omed rage, while the helple&s;s noble Ellinor became as its imme|diate, its only object. I greatly relied on the watchful friend&s;hip of all the Sydneys, but hardly could I hope even they could re&s;cue her from the Queen. I knew the letter Lord Leice&s;ter had ordered to be
<PB N="26" REF="28">
delivered to Elizabeth two hours after our departure, with the confirmation that mu&s;t give it, would infallibly, explain to her the &s;ecret of our marriage; which of it&s;elf confuted the tale he had advanced concerning our birth: nor could I doubt but every artifice would be practi&s;ed to unfold the whole my&s;tery; and, alas! un|generous minds too often fa&s;ten on the victim cruel fortune puts mo&s;t into their power.</P>
<P>Yet in the ha&s;te and confu&s;ion attend|ing our flight, we had, found it impo&s;&s;ible to unite my &s;i&s;ter in it: neither at that unhappy juncture could &s;he be found, and all the care we could &s;hew for her &s;afety was to recommend her in the mo&s;t &s;trenuous manner to tho&s;e few friends we expected the di&s;covery would leave us. While Ellinor had the re&s;olution to re|tain her own &s;ecret, we knew the power of the Queen could not reach her, and the &s;trength and fore&s;ight &s;he had at many times &s;hewn, per&s;uaded me &s;he was equal even to this harde&s;t of trials. Yet could I think of the in&s;olent interrogatories, and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
contumely &s;he mu&s;t inevitably encounter, without a bleeding heart? to be the gaze of every eye&mdash;the object of every tongue&mdash;oh greatly did &s;he need the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of innocence, the pride of royalty, to &s;u&s;tain her!</P>
<P>It had ever been our plan, if fortunate enough to e&s;cape &s;afely into France, to remain &s;till in di&s;gui&s;e 'till couriers from England could convince us how far the plot of Babington, and particularly Lord Leice&s;ter's knowledge of it, had tran&s;|pired. If it appeared his &s;hare in that &s;cheme was undi&s;covered, my Lord might with &s;afety avow him&s;elf; as marrying privately was a crime only in the eye of Elizabeth. And knowing too well her favourites ought ever to con&s;ider their in|fluence as precarious, Lord Leice&s;ter had &s;cattered large &s;ums in the hands of dif|ferent merchants in various kingdoms, as a re&s;ource, he now found his only one: nor was it in&s;ufficient. If, on the con|trary, we learnt Elizabeth had dived into that dangerous my&s;tery he was cen&s;urable only for concealing; by the charge of trea|&s;on,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
&s;he could perhaps affect his &s;afety in France, nay almo&s;t in Europe, and to pre&s;erve his life &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e mu&s;t &s;till be maintained while her's la&s;ted.</P>
<P>Though &s;eparated in infancy from every one allied to me, nothing could ever de|tach my heart from family claims; not daring to look towards my mother, I had always pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to &s;ee the &s;ole &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter of my father, Margaret Lady Mortimer. Educated with the late Queen in the Catholick per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he had married a general, and with him held many di&s;tingui&s;hed places under Phi|lip and Mary. The revolution both in politicks and religion cau&s;ed by the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth, was fatal alike to her honors and her plea&s;ures. General Lord Mortimer followed the widowed King to Spain, and rai&s;ed on his favor a fortune that gave him power to fix his own fate, when death &s;uddenly decided it. His relict re|tired to Rouen in Normandy, where his &s;i&s;ter was then Abbe&s;s, leaving her younger &s;on in the &s;ervice of Philip, and her elder in the army of Francis IId. Naturally of an
<PB N="29" REF="31">
active temper, &s;he could not re&s;olve to give up the world, though attached to it only by di&s;gu&s;ts, and lavi&s;hed a large por|tion of the immen&s;e fortune her mother and hu&s;band had united to bequeath her, in cheri&s;hing every exiled enemy of Eli|zabeth. Elated with the vain hope of one day &s;eeing her ill-fated brother throned in conjunction with the Queen of Scots, &s;he entered into all his mea&s;ures while that union was in agitation; and emerging once more from her convent, journeyed to Rome, where &s;he &s;pared neither pains nor money to win friends who might authorize and ratify it. She was among the few who knew the marriage &s;ecretly took place; &s;he even knew it was likely to pro|duce heirs of royalty and misfortune; when the di&s;covery, trial, and execution, of the Duke of Norfolk, entirely cru&s;hed her la&s;t fond project. From that moment &s;he had remained uninformed of the &s;e|cret &s;oul of Mary, and the fate of her un happy offspring. The avowed di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had &s;hewn towards Elizabeth, made it dangerous for her to return to her own
<PB N="30" REF="32">
country, and hardly in it could &s;he have arrived at &s;uch important intelligence, when once the clue was lo&s;t. A&s;piring, rich, and re&s;tle&s;s, &s;he &s;till affected to ap|pear the patrone&s;s of all oppre&s;&s;ed Eng|li&s;hmen; and if I found it prudent to avow my&s;elf, I might &s;afely rely on a welcome from her who would find with joy every hope &s;o long extinct renovated in me. Our pre&s;ent journey conducted us to a coa&s;t almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to that of Normandy. I fancied a plea&s;ure in having it in my power to claim her cares in the approach|ing melancholy cri&s;is, and was not with|out hopes Lord Leice&s;ter might &s;afely ap|pear in his own per&s;on, when once my &s;i&s;ter had e&s;caped to rejoin us.</P>
<P>The&s;e various reflections fully occupied my mind 'till the dawn of day, when our guide a&s;&s;ured us we might &s;afely, re&s;t in the hamlet to which we were near. Con|vinced by Mi&s;s Cecil's confidence in him he might, fully be tru&s;ted, I entered with weary limbs a cottage from whence its la|borious inhabitants were ju&s;t i&s;&s;uing to work. They u&s;ed their utmo&s;t diligence
<PB N="31" REF="33">
to procure us a homely meal, and we re|tired almo&s;t &s;tupified with inten&s;e fatigue to a bed which had only cleanline&s;s to re|commend it. Here both &s;unk into a re|po&s;e &s;o profound, that the day was clo&s;ing when we aro&s;e. Our watchful guide a&s;|&s;ured us we mu&s;t ha&s;ten over the dinner which long had waited for us, as we had many miles to journey ere we could find a &s;afe re&s;ting place. Earne&s;tly did I wi&s;h to remain with our pre&s;ent ho&s;ts 'till the next morning, but &s;ubmitting to nece&s;&s;ity, re|mounted in &s;ilence. Arthur well ju&s;tified the confidence of his Lady, having &s;e|lected hor&s;es that never flagged through the whole journey, and always guarding again&s;t di&s;covery by conducting us thro' roads very little frequented; among which he found hamlets who&s;e inhabitants were gratified in merely &s;eeing him, and who only attended to his companions in the hope of obliging him. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at ob&s;erving how little curio&s;ity we ex|cited, forgetful that the mind is worn down with the body, and that a common laborer rarely con&s;iders any thing beyond
<PB N="32" REF="34">
tho&s;e common comforts ince&s;&s;ant indu&s;try alone can procure him.</P>
<P>In&s;en&s;ible to the beauties of the country through which we pa&s;&s;ed, I was for ever employed in looking for the &s;ea, and when at la&s;t I di&s;covered it, &s;trove to extend my &s;ight beyond, and dwell on that &s;hore where I alone could think Lord Leice&s;ter &s;afe. The nearer we drew towards the coa&s;t, the &s;tronger my fears became. It was inhabited chiefly by men hard by na|ture, and de&s;perate by profe&s;&s;ion; ac|cu&s;tomed to murder as well as plunder tho&s;e wrecked on the &s;hore, they &s;ternly examined and defied every pa&s;&s;enger. I could hardly per&s;uade my&s;elf &s;ome of the&s;e were not &s;tragglers from the banditti of Williams, and ble&s;&s;ed heaven as tho' all peril had been pa&s;t, when we arrived at the homely dwelling of Arthur. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tood on a lonely part of the &s;hore, where lofty cliffs &s;hooting far into the &s;ea, gave &s;afety in the little bay to a few fi&s;hing-boats and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Ah, how do our awakened pa&s;&s;ions entirely curb every prejudice! Of late tho&s;e livid lightnings,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
at which my nature ever before &s;hrunk, appeared but the quivering lamp of love. Now I &s;aw and heard undaunted the en|circling &s;ea (once the happy boundary of human pur&s;uits) who&s;e re&s;tle&s;s waves roar a proud defiance to all who dare approach it; and my &s;ole fear &s;prung from learning that the wind was entirely contrary, and the watery cha&s;m yet impa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>Too late we lamented departing unat|tended. Unable in this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot to di&s;cover any part of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the Court &s;ince our flight, and unwil|ling to tru&s;t, as well as unable to &s;pare our guide, or his friends to make an en|quiry at the next town, two mo&s;t tedious days elap&s;ed in melancholy and conjecture. Arthur, not being able to go out in his own ve&s;&s;el, without &s;u&s;picions and exa|minations we dur&s;t not encounter, hired a large fi&s;hing &s;mack, in which he &s;tored the few nece&s;&s;aries our limited &s;ituation allowed us to provide, and I watched without cea&s;ing the playing of its &s;treamers. On the evening of the third day, I perceived them &s;ud|denly
<PB N="34" REF="36">
point towards France: re&s;t having recruited my &s;trength and &s;pirits, I &s;tart|ed up in a tran&s;port of joy. The few ma|riners being gathered at la&s;t together, I &s;tept with a lightened heart into a mi&s;er|able boat, which bore us &s;wiftly towards that de&s;tined to convey us over, when two &s;trangers riding full &s;peed to the &s;hore, called to us to put back with the mo&s;t frantick eagerne&s;s. I took the alarm, and offered the mariners imagi|nary worlds to row on, when Arthur in|&s;i&s;ting he knew the voice, and di&s;regard|ing all I could urge, turned the boat. I threw my arms round my Lord, as though my heart would have opened to hide him; and regardle&s;s of his remon|&s;trances, that we could be in no danger from only two people, however ho&s;tile their intention, my &s;en&s;es died away. Recover|ing at la&s;t, I found my&s;elf in the cabin of the ve&s;&s;el, reclining on the bo&s;om of Lord Leice&s;ter, while a youth who knelt at my feet, pre&s;t my hands alternately to his lips&mdash;"Look up, my beloved, cried my Lord, and &s;ee whom fortune has unit|ed
<PB N="35" REF="37">
in our exile." "Ah, rather do not look up, lovely Matilda, cried Mi&s;s Cecil (for it was that &s;weet girl indeed in the habit of a boy) till you have con&s;idered what reception you ought to give the &s;elfi&s;h friend who has dared interweave her &s;ate with yours. Yet hear, before you judge me, added &s;he, ri&s;ing with a mild maje&s;|ty, which gave un&s;peakable graces to the blu&s;hes that every moment vi&s;ited and re|tired from her cheeks. I am going to lay my whole heart before you both. It is in vain to attempt veiling a weakne&s;s from Lord Leice&s;ter, &s;o many circum&s;tances have concurred to betray; it remains with me then to ennoble it. The di&s;covery of your marriage, my amiable friends, quenched the la&s;t feeble hope which lin|gered in my heart. Convinced my par|tiality could never become his happine&s;s, I in&s;tantly re&s;olved it &s;hould become his pride. Self-love expired before the ele|vated idea. Ah, what but this could have enabled me to lead him into the gar|den at midnight, and take a look I then thought a la&s;t one, without dropping a

&s;ingle tear? I &s;aw in a moment all the merit, the charms of her character whom he had cho&s;en. Should I hate her then for being all I would have endeavoured to be? for accepting that di&s;tinction (which not depending on youth, beauty, merit, or fortune) is the deare&s;t bounty of in|dulgent Heaven? Ah, no, my heart was ju&s;ter, and welcomed her as one born to divide it with Lord Leice&s;ter. Solely in|tent on the pro&s;perous flight of both, I almo&s;t forgot the &s;ervants planted in the Rece&s;s, and all the mon&s;ters that infe&s;ted it. I fancied to my&s;elf tho&s;e hours, when all your dangers pa&s;t, you would &s;ome|times think of her who could only think of you. I heard both &s;igh, and wi&s;hing but to be enough remembered to &s;often without wounding either heart, I &s;ighed my&s;elf; and &s;tarted from the&s;e plea&s;ant reveries at the voice of our Steward, who ru&s;hing abruptly into the room, di&s;mayed my every &s;en&s;e with his recital. "Re|joice, Madam, rejoice, cried the man with hone&s;t zeal, and think this &s;tranger born for your &s;ervice. Never can we
<PB N="37" REF="39">
enough adore the a&s;toni&s;hing interpo&s;ition of Heaven! It is not long &s;ince when tired with watching in the dungeon, a variety of voices &s;truck our ears, which &s;oon approaching us, every man &s;um|moned all his courage; &s;hortly the door was unbolted, and a ruffian darted in, who&s;e daring look was changed to an icy palene&s;s (which lights from behind re|flected) when he found each arm &s;eized by one of our people, while a third held a pi&s;tol to his head. Uttering a faint imprecation, he alarmed the re&s;t, and both &s;ides immediately fired. We then pu&s;hed forward, without any regard for tho&s;e who fell; and pur&s;uing the re&s;t through the various avenues of the den, &s;ecured them all, as we have rea&s;on to imagine, a&s;toni&s;hment half depriving them of the power of re&s;i&s;tance. In the large&s;t apartment of this &s;trange place, we found (gue&s;s, Madam, how we were amazed) our Lord, with an unknown lady, and three of our fellow &s;ervants, who were newly brought in by the ruffians, and bound; nor do I doubt but a dreadful death was

de&s;igned them, but for this wonderful event." Alienated as my affections mu&s;t long have been from my father, continu|ed Mi&s;s Cecil, turning the di&s;cour&s;e to her&s;elf, I could not hear of &s;o wonderful an e&s;cape, without feeling the mo&s;t lively &s;atisfaction. It was damped, however, by recollecting the body of Williams. I &s;aw too plainly, I mu&s;t now account for it to one inve&s;ted with authority to en|quire, and re&s;olution to convict me. Lo&s;t in a variety of plans, my father had been &s;ome minutes in the hou&s;e, ere I &s;tirred from my own anti-chamber, where the approach of Lord Burleigh entirely con|fined me. Faint and &s;ilent I aro&s;e, and bending before him, wept forth my duty and my joy. "I know all you would &s;ay my child, cried he eagerly, and how this horrible place was di&s;covered; but where is Lord Leice&s;ter and his Lady?" Struck dumb with a que&s;tion, as clear and deci|&s;ive as if he had been a &s;harer in the tran|&s;actions of the night, my eyes were fixed upon him in terror and &s;tupefaction; when my brother, impatient to di&s;cover
<PB N="39" REF="41">
both, made his way at once into my chamber: whither the loud exclamation he gave collected all pre&s;ent, nor could my father re&s;i&s;t ha&s;tening, as fa&s;t as his infirmities permitted; hoping, as I had rea|&s;on to imagine, he there &s;hould find that enemy, who more engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts than the pre&s;ervation of his own life, or mine. How were all amazed when the lifele&s;s villain Williams, alone appeared? Some examined his pockets, while others &s;earched the chamber. My father &s;poke not for &s;ome time, when fixing an eye on me fal&s;hood never dur&s;t encounter, he pointed ironically to the body:" <HI>You</HI> killed him, doubtle&s;s, &s;aid he, and re|lap&s;ed again into his meditation. After a time, &s;ome faint remembrance glanced acro&s;s his mind. He drew near, and ex|amining the dead man's features, &s;eemed to recollect, and in recollecting to dread him; for at once he &s;hrunk into him&s;elf, and repeated in a low voice, "<HI>that</HI> vil|lain!" Not having, however, any clue to his thoughts, though he had to mine, there re&s;ted my idea of the matter. I
<PB N="40" REF="42">
collected all my courage, and framing the mo&s;t plau&s;ible tale the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion allowed, re&s;olved to abide by it what|ever the event. My father likewi&s;e &s;et|tled his plan of proceeding, and far from regulating the &s;ervants, who&s;e every mo|tion fear made wild and eccentric, turned his attention &s;olely on me. Ri&s;ing at la&s;t with a &s;tern air, "Ro&s;e, &s;aid he, follow me." I had of late been but too much accu&s;|tomed to that har&s;h voice, and obeyed in &s;ilence. Seating him&s;elf in an adjacent apartment, he demanded an exact recital of all the horrors of the night. I com|menced with the being rou&s;ed by Wil|liams. I related his de&s;ign, and the threats which almo&s;t brought my life to the point of a moment, when &s;ub&s;tituting Arthur for Lord Leice&s;ter, I affirmed it was <HI>his</HI> providential arrival, guided by an un|known lady, and the de&s;perate courage &s;upplied by the emergency, which re&s;|cued me from the knife of that inveterate villain. He interrupted me, eagerly en|quiring for the lady. On, my a&s;&s;uring him &s;he was gone,&mdash;"think well, cried
<PB N="41" REF="43">
he, in a terrible voice, think well, ra&s;h, romantic girl, ere you venture again to an&s;wer me. I <HI>know</HI> the cau&s;e of Leice&s;|ter's flight, I know too its companion; I know that he e&s;caped a few hours be|fore from the dungeon in which I was found; I know, if &s;o, who mu&s;t be his confederate.

Convinced (by whatever wonderful means he was &s;o fully inform|ed) that I could not hope to delude him, I &s;tarted up, my complexion changing every moment. I indeed find my&s;elf, my Lord, cried I, unequal to a fal&s;hood, but you will find me equal to the mo&s;t de&s;|perate truth. It was Lord Leice&s;ter, I own, whom Heaven it&s;elf brought to my relief, and &s;hall I deliver him up to death who &s;aved me from it? Oh never, never!

he with his cho&s;en happy bride can &s;afely wait till the violence of the Queen gives place to ju&s;tice. Tortures &s;hould wring no more from me, and whatever my fate, it will always admit of one &s;weet con&s;o|lation, in the remembrance that Heaven allowed me to recompence a benefit at the moment of receiving it. Why &s;hould I repeat, &s;ighed our fair narrator, all the rage, tears, and altercation, that for a few days made life a torment to me? Totally confined to my apartment, and treated like a criminal, it was even hinted my conti|nued ob&s;tinacy would provoke my father into making that horrible den, the Re|ce&s;s, my pri&s;on. In one in&s;tance alone was I fortunate: my my&s;terious &s;peech impre&s;&s;ed on my father's mind an opini|on, he had previou&s;ly adopted, that Lord Leice&s;ter, with his Lady, mu&s;t be &s;ecret|ed in or near Kenilworth Ca&s;tle, whither his mo&s;t tru&s;ted &s;pies immediately re&s;ort|ed, and amu&s;ed him with various &s;uppo|&s;itions di&s;patched daily from thence. Oppre&s;&s;ed with unkindne&s;s and &s;everity, often did my weak, my wavering heart

prompt me to follow, and if po&s;&s;ible overtake you; but the in&s;tant recollecti|on of the obvious track &s;uch a ra&s;h flight mu&s;t open to your inveterate pur&s;uers, always &s;ubdued &s;o unju&s;tifiable a wi&s;h. My father at once changed his mea&s;ures, and relea&s;ing, carried me with him to every &s;u&s;pected place in the neighbour|hood; hoping from the alteration of my features he &s;hould di&s;cover that which contained Lord Leice&s;ter. By a fatality which completed my misfortunes, in one of the&s;e tours we encountered Irton, that lover who co&s;t me both the Queen's and my father's favour; encouraged by Lord Burleigh, once more he returned with us. Incapable of love, but infatuated with politicks, his ardent de&s;ire of holding a rank in his favorite line through my means revived. Regardle&s;s of my tears, coldne&s;s, and di&s;dain, he had always looked up to my father as the decider of his fate, and &s;till continued to do &s;o. I had the mi&s;ery of learning a bargain was made, of which I mu&s;t be the uncon|&s;enting pledge, and that almo&s;t immedi|ately.
<PB N="44" REF="46">
I knew my father's inexorable nature; I knew likewi&s;e that of Irton; and had rea&s;on to dread the next fit of rage might con&s;ign me to legal infamy, unle&s;s by a de&s;peration on my own part, I prevented this on theirs. Wonder not that at la&s;t I yielded to think of a mea&s;ure &s;o long combated. I &s;elected a &s;ervant in whom I had a confidence, who procured me this di&s;gui&s;e, and offered to protect me. I ble&s;t that faith I could never hope &s;uffi|ciently to reward; and winged alike with hope and fear, pur&s;ued your route with indefatigable diligence; leaving a letter which &s;poke of London as my a&s;ylum."</P>
<P>To this generous recital, my Lord, and &s;elf, replied with reiterated a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip and protection, as well as the highe&s;t encomiums on her courage and conduct. Shortly after my Lord quitted the cabin. "You who have long been the confidante, the &s;ole confidante of my weakne&s;s, re&s;umed Mi&s;s Cecil in a tender tone, while her doubtful eye &s;eemed to &s;earch my very &s;oul, will be le&s;s &s;urprized at its effect than its confe&s;&s;ion.

I turned my eyes with the &s;weete&s;t &s;atisfaction from my love to my friend, from my friend to my love; the &s;ame mild orb delicately illum'd either face; a manly tenderne&s;s marked Lord Leice&s;ter's attention to me, a grateful de|ference that to her, while the fair Ro&s;e, rich in the applau&s;es of her own heart, and nobly con&s;cious of her claims on ours, forgot there was any thing wanting to her happine&s;s.

The next morning entirely re|ver&s;ed the &s;cene, and de&s;troyed at once our comfort and tranquillity; with the moon the weather changed, and the wind becoming entirely contrary, that deadly &s;ickne&s;s incident to the element, &s;eized alike on Mi&s;s Cecil and me, ab&s;orbing even the &s;en&s;e of danger. With an ex|hau&s;ted &s;ullenne&s;s we &s;urveyed tho&s;e roar|ing &s;urges, who&s;e hollows fancy could not venture to fathom, and &s;aw our&s;elves driven almo&s;t back to the &s;hore of England, without &s;trength or &s;pirits even to lament our cruel de&s;tiny.

weather. To&s;t about for near ten days, we at la&s;t made Havre-de-grace early in the morning, and more dead than alive I was conveyed to the fir&s;t inn, and in&s;tantly put to bed.</P>
<P>Here my fatigues and apprehen&s;ions were very near producing a misfortune I from the fir&s;t had dreaded. I had but too much rea&s;on to fear that the poor babe who had been the innocent cau&s;e of the&s;e calamities would never live to reward us for them, but urged into a premature ex|i&s;tence, of all this mighty world would claim only a grave. The grief this gave me increa&s;ed the danger; I knew the pa&s;|&s;ionate de&s;ire of offspring which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my Lord. I had often flattered my&s;elf this wi&s;h, if indulged, would fill up that void in his life the promi&s;e had cau&s;ed. What then &s;hould I &s;uffer to &s;ee a di&s;appointment added to the &s;acrifices and degradations I had already entailed upon him? It was at this cri&s;is all the merit of Mi&s;s Cecil &s;hone forth: to the delicate attentions of a friend &s;he united the &s;oft &s;olicitude of a mother. She &s;oothed my mind with the

mo&s;t flattering hopes, and jealous le&s;t in any fretful moment my &s;ecret &s;oul &s;hould doubt her attachment, &s;he &s;o entirely fore|&s;talled every &s;u&s;picion, that uninformed &s;pectators would rather have imagined me the only &s;ource of her happine&s;s, than the &s;ole ob&s;tacle to it. At length I conquered the danger, and then my &s;pirits returned fa&s;ter than my &s;trength. Often I talked of England, of my &s;i&s;ter, and the expected di&s;patches. I wrote to Lady Mortimer, and briefly related tho&s;e incidents I have here explained in many pages; I claimed her alliance, her protection, explained the pre&s;ent delicate &s;ituation of my health, and enclo&s;ed my picture in little, not doubting but that would identify my birth: and part of the diamonds we brought with us were converted into money, to e&s;|tabli&s;h our rank, if we found it prudent to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>I continued a long time too weak to quit my chamber, yet at intervals a new fear di&s;turbed me. I perceived my Lord ab&s;ent and anxious; frequently an extreme palene&s;s overcame the floridne&s;s of nature,
<PB N="51" REF="53">
and traver&s;ing the room for hours, he would give way to a chagrin the cau&s;e of which not all my tendere&s;t intrea|ties could wring from him. I often re|called the words of my &s;i&s;ter; I fancied he vainly regretted the di&s;tinction of roy|alty, the pride of &s;plendor, and the plea|&s;ure of popularity. Accu&s;tomed to be the object of every eye, to have every wi&s;h fore&s;talled, to be obeyed ere he &s;poke, I, &s;ighing, owned the change in his fate might well appear dreary. Not daring to hint my ideas, I impatiently expected the return of the expre&s;s &s;ent to Rouen, hoping it would open new pro&s;pects, and di&s;per&s;e the heavy cloud between him and felicity. But oh how delu&s;ive is human per&s;pica|city!&mdash;in&s;olently vain of our bounded knowledge, we boa&s;t of tracing every thought and action of individuals &s;eas di|vide from us, even at the very moment we misjudge all with whom we are immedi|ately &s;urrounded. My fond attention fixed partially on Lord Leice&s;ter, looked not out of him&s;elf for cau&s;es of grief. Lady Mortimer's an&s;wer at length arriv'd; &s;he acknowledged her relation&s;hip to me with
<PB N="52" REF="54">
&s;urprize and plea&s;ure, and kindly la|mented her infirm health did not permit her to pay, in coming to me, that defer|ence my regal birth intitled me to; but that her train waited our permi&s;&s;ion to e&s;|cort us to Rouen, whither &s;he urged us to ha&s;ten, as well for our own &s;afety as to gratify her impatience. My expectations being fully an&s;wered by this letter, breath|le&s;s with joy I rai&s;ed my eyes to Lord Leice&s;ter, who had been peru&s;ing it over my &s;houlder; they met his full of a &s;ad|ne&s;s &s;o meaning, it numbed my very heart.</P>
<P>Long u&s;ed now to dread every day would teem with &s;ome horrible event, I &s;natched his hand, and in broken accents only begged to know it. He &s;unk at my feet, and hiding his tears with my robe, &s;welled with &s;obs that almo&s;t cracked my heart&s;trings. "You have told me you loved me, Matilda?" &s;aid he in a broken and doubtful voice.&mdash;"Told you! re-echoed I; heavens and earth, can that, my Lord, remain a que&s;tion? have I not for you forgot the rights of &s;ex, of rank, of every thing but love?" "Have I not done all

"Debate no more admitted merits, cried I with wild im|patience; oh give me the truth, and all the truth at once; nor doubly tor|ture me with this pomp of prepara|tion. Whatever it is, I will remember there might be a wor&s;e, &s;ince my eyes &s;till behold you: every evil but your danger my &s;oul can cope with. You &s;peak not yet: we are then di&s;covered, betrayed, delivered up, condemned&mdash;the fatal power of Elizabeth has reached us even here, for nothing el&s;e can &s;urely thus af|fect you?" "It has indeed," &s;ighed he. "Oh why then, exclaimed I, forgetful of all my a&s;&s;urances, am I unprovided with poi&s;on? for death mu&s;t now be the only mercy hoped. May the ocean, from which we with &s;o much difficulty e&s;caped, entomb us on our return, rather than re|&s;ign us up to her licen&s;ed vengeance."

His &s;ym|pathi&s;ing eyes explained the truth&mdash;the agonizing truth&mdash;my &s;oul under&s;tood him &mdash;agha&s;t with horror, my eyes &s;eemed to &s;et, and every limb to &s;tiffen to marble; a &s;en&s;ation, to which fainting is ea&s;e, con|den&s;ed every faculty, and nature, power|ful nature, &s;truck on my heart at the thought of my mother, with a pang per|haps equal to that with which &s;he bore me.

A horrible tran&s;port for &s;ome mo|ments benumbed me;&mdash;how multiplied, how complicate, how various, how new, were then my feelings! feelings which ever return with the remembrance! feel|ings which opened a vein in my character as well as my heart&mdash;all &s;en&s;e of gentle|ne&s;s vani&s;hed. The fir&s;t paper I peru&s;ed

confirmed my fears&mdash;I &s;aw in the fir&s;t lines the decided fate of the martyred Mary.&mdash; I &s;eemed to behold the &s;avage hand of Elizabeth, dipt in the blood of an anoint|ed &s;i&s;ter &s;overeign.&mdash;I felt &s;he was my mother, my fond, my helple&s;s mother, and my heart floated in tears, which were hours working their way up to my burn|ing eyes. The furies of Ore&s;tes &s;eemed to &s;urround me, and thunder parricide, nothing but parricide, in my ear. What, groaned I, after &s;o long an endurance, &s;uch complicated evils, &s;upported with a patience that left not her enemies a pre|tence for &s;acrificing her, that mi&s;ery was re&s;erved for her daughter? Perhaps even at the moment &s;he laid that beauteous head, &s;o many hearts were born to wor|&s;hip, on the block, every agony of death was doubled, by the knowledge her daughter brought her there.&mdash;Why did I not peri&s;h in the Rece&s;s by lightning? Why did not the ocean entomb me? Why, why, oh God, was I permitted to &s;urvive my innocence? In the wildne&s;s of my afflic|tion, I cur&s;ed the hour, the fatal hour, when

I ventured beyond the bounds pre&s;cribed me. Yes love, love it&s;elf was annihilated, and (could I once have believed it) deep|ly did I wi&s;h I had never &s;een Lord Lei|ce&s;ter. Pa&s;&s;ing from paper to paper, I &s;aw friends and enemies unite in the eu|logium of the Royal Martyr. What mag|nanimity, what &s;weetne&s;s, what &s;anctitude did they a&s;&s;ign to her&mdash;a bright example in the mo&s;t awful of trials!&mdash;Subliming the idea of revenge in&s;eparable from hu|man nature, &s;he centered it all in compa|ri&s;on.&mdash;And what a compari&s;on!&mdash;ca&s;ting off the veil of her mortality, to darken over the future days of Elizabeth, the radiant track of her a&s;cen&s;ion concentered, while it dimmed the eyes of tho&s;e &s;ur|rounding nations, who too late bewailed their &s;hameful inactivity.

or a little, but a little, &s;oothe its &s;ad remainder.</P>
<P>Yet vain and uncertain were all my ideas re&s;pecting the di&s;covery I imputed to Elizabeth. Convinced nothing had ever been entru&s;ted to friend&s;hip, I was a&s;&s;ured nothing could have been betrayed. In the bo&s;om of my &s;i&s;ter our mutual &s;e|cret re&s;ted, and there I imagined every motive mu&s;t bury it. I reviewed every paper once more; alas, I only added to my affliction, by ob&s;erving the name of Ellinor indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided. Lo&s;t in conjecture it was &s;ome time ere I per|ceived one letter my robe half covered: I pre&s;t to my lips the writing of Lady Arundel.</P>
<P>"Scarce dare I allow my&s;elf time to congratulate you, my mo&s;t honoured friends, on e&s;caping the deadly rage of Elizabeth, &s;o much do I know you long for news of your &s;i&s;ter.

to Court the very hour my Lord and you left it. Filling the place of my &s;i&s;ter (who ought to have been in waiting) by this means &s;he was unfortunately pre&s;ent at the time the Queen peru&s;ed Lord Lei|ce&s;ter's explanatory letter. Unbounded in her re&s;entment, &s;he levelled it all again&s;t the unfortunate Ellinor; and in &s;everely taxing her with treachery and guilt, dropt expre&s;&s;ions by which your &s;i&s;ter learnt the dangerous &s;ituation your flight had unfor|tunately placed her in, as well as the evils to which you both &s;tood expo&s;ed. Grief, fear, and indignation almo&s;t deprived her of rea&s;on; and the Queen in&s;i&s;ting her &s;ilence proceeded from ob&s;tinacy, threw at her a large book &s;he had been reading, which &s;triking the &s;weet Ellinor on the temple, &s;he dropt &s;en&s;ele&s;s at once. The other ladies cut her laces; and the eager eyes of the Queen were attracted by a &s;mall pacquet &s;u&s;pended to the black rib|bon &s;he always wore round her neck. Not even the &s;urprizing effect its contents took on the Queen, has ever enabled any one to gue&s;s at them; colour, &s;trength, and

&s;peech, for &s;ome moments for&s;ook Eliza|beth, when recovering her faculties, &s;he once more peru&s;ed the memorials; then deliberately tore them into atoms; and &s;ummoning Wal&s;ingham and Burleigh, all her attendants, &s;ave the old Lady La|timer, retired. From the Court Ellinor was conveyed that night, though by whom, or whither, is yet a &s;ecret. Love and friend&s;hip are however ince&s;&s;antly employ|ed in her favour; nor can her pri&s;on long remain &s;o when once it is di&s;covered. Were I to name the mo&s;t ardent and anx|ious of her lovers I &s;hould &s;urprize you, but he &s;hall only be known when with con&s;cious pride he pre&s;ents her to you and claims his reward.</P>
<P>The profound policy Elizabeth has al|ways pre&s;erved with re&s;pect to Lord Lei|ce&s;ter &s;ince his flight, is far from being &s;atisfactory to his friends. She &s;peaks of him only in an indifferent light, and as if employed by her&s;elf; while all that pa&s;&s;ed between them almo&s;t every body under|&s;tands, though no one dares to &s;ay &s;o.

The galling chain from which &s;he has at la&s;t enfranchi&s;ed Mary, writhes round her own heart; and if it would gra|tify you to &s;ee her tremble, believe me you need only &s;ee her. Obliged to avow remor&s;e, to give an example in the &s;everity of her mourning, for a deed only her own will could have authori&s;ed, &s;he has the mi&s;ery of knowing her murdered royal pri&s;oner enthroned in Heaven, and em|balmed in the tears of even her own peo|ple.

<P>The full conviction Elizabeth had in|curred the abhorrence of all the world, by this horrible infraction of the rights of royalty, &s;ociety, and &s;ex, a little gra|tified my exqui&s;ite re&s;entment. Yes, &s;ighed I, Heaven has invented a puni&s;h|ment proportionable to her crime. Coun|teracting by one &s;troke the policy of her whole life, &s;he has permitted her&s;elf to be

Tho&s;e fiery pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o often de&s;tructive to others, wanting now an object, mu&s;t prey upon the heart that conceals them; till envying the glorious end, as &s;he ever did the di&s;tingui&s;hed bloom of Mary Stuart, her fate is wound up in fears of her offspring. In vain her cruel care would extirpate them; every crime will but give birth to a new fear, and the martyrdom of the Queen of Scots will multiply the cau&s;es of her terror, &s;ince &s;he now knows more than one child &s;urvives her.</P>
<P>As the evening clo&s;ed, this billet was given me from my Lord:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The heart which has long bled by anticipation for your &s;orrow, demands to partake it with you. Oh! my &s;ole love, deny me not a &s;hare in your compa&s;&s;ion. Fearful every moment I &s;hould lo&s;e the daughter, the fate of the mother &s;truggled

<P>This little billet, happily calculated to awaken the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, drew forth my tears in great abundance. I reproached my&s;elf with violence, and unkindne&s;s. Let me not, cried I, while &s;o &s;everely lamenting one error, be guilty of another. Lo&s;t to the duties, the claims (oh Heaven that I &s;hould be &s;o!) of a daughter, tho&s;e of a wife ought to a&s;&s;ume a double influ|ence.

<P>I &s;ee too plainly the truth, the fatal truth, &s;aid I, recurring to Lady Arundell's letter. Lovely, ill-fated &s;i&s;ter, it was you then who accelerated our haple&s;s mother's death! That Elizabeth knew me for a daughter of the Stuart line, &s;he took a deadly means to certify, but how &s;he di&s;|covered it, mu&s;t ever have appeared mi|raculous without this letter; I plainly per|ceive my &s;i&s;ter indi&s;creetly wore the du|plicate proof of our birth, its deare&s;t and be&s;t te&s;timonial, while mine is yet trea|&s;ured in the &s;ecret cabinet at Kenilworth; and this in one moment de&s;troyed her own peace, and determined the fate of her mother. Oh, mo&s;t inexorable! Could thy vengeance demand more than one victim? Is then the daughter &s;ilently &s;a|crificed on the lamented grave of her pa|rent? Never more, beloved &s;i&s;ter of my
<PB N="64" REF="66">
blood and heart, &s;hall I behold thee! never more draw comfort from thy &s;weet accents, nor with thee pierce through the veil of futurity, and catch gleams of golden days. Doubtle&s;s Elizabeth ima|gines this the only authentic proof exi&s;t|ing? Oh, if in con&s;equence of that opi|nion &s;he touches the innocent life of El|linor, I will offer inconte&s;table evidence alike of Mary's marriage with Norfolk, and our birth, at the foot of Henry's throne. He is famed for ju&s;tice and ge|nero&s;ity; I am, alas, the helple&s;s object of both. The family of Gui&s;e will unite to protect me; perhaps all Europe will aid too late the powerle&s;s King of Scots, and &s;ave him from feeling his impotence of royalty.</P>
<P>Unable entirely to &s;hare, unwilling in the lea&s;t to controul, my tender feelings for my family, Lord Leice&s;ter's life could not at this period be called happy. Mi&s;s Cecil again appeared our guardian angel. As an intermediate per&s;on &s;he felt for, &s;he &s;oothed both, till my irritated pa&s;&s;ions meliorated in&s;en&s;ibly into &s;adne&s;s. I be|gan

to li&s;ten to the flattering hopes conti|nually in&s;tilled, that my &s;i&s;ter &s;till lived, and &s;ome fortunate event might yet re&s;tore her to us. My Lord was a&s;&s;ured, by the united te&s;timony of his friends, that Eli|zabeth had no pretence for impeaching him, and Henry learnt with plea&s;ure his de&s;ign of fixing his re&s;idence in France. Thus again our peace &s;eemed re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed on a better foundation than it had yet been: and I devoted my attention, for the pre&s;ent, &s;olely to recompencing my Lord for all he had renounced in my favor.</P>
<P>Overwhelmed with the repeated &s;olici|tations of Lady Mortimer, I at la&s;t &s;um|moned re&s;olution to &s;et out for Rouen; from whence we had been &s;upplied with every accommodation &s;uitable to our rank. That city having long been di&s;tingui&s;hed as the refuge of every noble exile, my Lord fixed on it for our re&s;idence: my relation to Lady Mortimer en&s;ured me every ho|nor, and Lord Leice&s;ter's name would &s;oon form us a little court. That cri&s;is now approached very near, which both con&s;i|dered with joy and terror, and it appeared

&s;ome relief to be in the care of a Lady, who&s;e experience and tenderne&s;s might le&s;&s;en my &s;ufferings.

<P>Aver&s;e to being known ere we had formed a &s;uite, and &s;elected a habitation, he gave Lady Mortimer notice that we &s;hould not arrive till night. As we pa&s;t through the gates of Rouen, e&s;corted by her train, my heart beat high with the idea of meeting the &s;i&s;ter of the noble Norfolk; the only being (my own ex|cepted) allied in blood to me. She met me at the entrance of a &s;aloon; I cla&s;ped her hands with emotion; I wept upon, I pre&s;&s;ed them to my bo&s;om. She em|braced me with extreme compo&s;ure, and holding me back a moment, ran over my features and per&s;on, with &s;o keen a &s;cru|tiny, as convinced me &s;en&s;ibility was not her characteri&s;tic. While due compli|ments

pa&s;&s;ed between Mi&s;s Cecil, my Lord, and her, I, in turn, indulged my|&s;elf with an examination. Her per&s;on was full-&s;ized, tall, and graceful, like all the family of Howard; her features vi&s;i|bly marked both by age, and decayed beauty; her dre&s;s &s;imple, being like my own, of mourning, and her manners &s;trongly conveyed the idea of magnifi|cence. Dignity tinctured with au&s;terity, marked her conver&s;ation; and I felt, to my great regret, I had gained a relation without winning a friend. Two monks, to whom &s;he paid a profound deference; an old officer of the Mortimer family, and his &s;i&s;ter, were introduced to us as per&s;ons entitled to &s;hare our &s;ecret; and we &s;aw it indeed lodged with them, ere our con&s;ent was demanded. Lord Lei|ce&s;ter was &s;truck di&s;agreeably at this di&s;|covery, but &s;truggled with his pride, and affected good humour; while finding my|&s;elf, after all my dangers, under a roof &s;anctified by alliance, and where my Lord &s;eemed re&s;tored to his proper &s;phere, plea|&s;ure dilated my whole &s;oul, and I &s;at

<P>She avoided, in con&s;ideration of my &s;tate and fatigues, entering into our af|fairs, and brought her own before us with a kind freedom; a&s;&s;ured us of the friend&s;hip of her elde&s;t &s;on, Lord Morti|mer, who preferred the plea&s;ure of liber|ty in both his religion and actions, by &s;erving in the wars of France, to &s;eeking a precarious fortune in England; un|der an enemy to the Pope. The landed property, once the inheritance of the Mortimers, her Lord had prudently di&s;|po&s;ed of ere the return of Philip to Spain, in who&s;e &s;ervice he had ever continued: and that Monarch, famed as he was for meanne&s;s and ingratitude, had &s;hewn a &s;ignal &s;en&s;e of the attachment, by a grant to her younge&s;t &s;on of a con&s;iderable por|tion of land in Jamaica, which he had cultivated under &s;uch indulgences, as made it every day more valuable.

<P>Lord Leice&s;ter &s;lightly touched on the little di&s;gu&s;t he had ju&s;tly conceived, and indulged a drow&s;ine&s;s which I could not immediately partake. New objects had awakened my fancy, and invaded my re&s;t; images more plea&s;ing than had ble&s;t me &s;ince the moment I had quitted Kenil|worth Ca&s;tle enlivened my &s;oul.

promi&s;ed peace proved the aera in my life and became &s;o by a misfortune which ab|&s;orbed the &s;en&s;e of every other.

Drop|ping into that &s;oft lethargy which fore|runs &s;leep&mdash;ah! why had I not been bu|ried in the deepe&s;t? but I was born the fate of all I ever loved.

At that fatal &s;ound my very &s;oul recoiled, but my Lord not deigning to an&s;wer, drew a &s;word, always laid under his pillow, and haughtily com|manded

them to leave the chamber. The men advancing, he aimed at the one near|e&s;t him, who, by in&s;tantly retreating, jarred the arm of his companion. The fla&s;h of death, the tremendous &s;ound, the falling of the &s;word&mdash;all, all, confirmed in a moment my fate&mdash;Lord Leice&s;ter, the wor&s;hipped of my &s;oul&mdash;my all on earth&mdash;alas, almo&s;t my all in heaven, &s;unk into my weak arms in a la&s;t convul|&s;ion.&mdash;That which, at the appointed pe|riod, will annihilate nature, can alone &s;urpa&s;s the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment. Terrible too was the confu&s;ion of the&s;e wretches at &s;o unfore&s;een an event. The faint light they carried gleamed over tho&s;e features &s;o adored. He tremulou&s;ly rai&s;ed my hand to his lips, and gave up his &s;oul in &s;ilence on my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But who &s;hall &s;peak the mi&s;ery of my mind? Precipitated, like the offend|ing angels, at once from heaven to hell, an awful &s;ilence took place of lamentation. Oh it was a woe too mighty for complaint! In&s;en&s;ible to fear, I at length de&s;perately urged his murderers once more to unite

tho&s;e they had thus &s;eparated. I bathed my bo&s;om in the ble&s;&s;ed crim&s;on which &s;till flowed from his, and called alike on heaven and man to end me. Alas, the only object of my hopes, my fears, my cares, my wi&s;hes, was congealing before the eyes of the forlorn wretch condemned to &s;urvive him. The entrance of Lady Mortimer wrought grief up to phrenzy, and for many days gave that relief to all my agonies.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on dawned upon my di&s;ordered &s;oul like light through chaos. A dim re|membrance of what I had been, preceded that of what I was. Faintly I recognized even the weak hand with which I drew back the curtain. I found my&s;elf in a narrow cell, lighted only through an ob|&s;cure ca&s;ement of painted gla&s;s. Intui|tively my lips pronounced the name of Leice&s;ter&mdash;in vain&mdash;Nothing but my own voice returned upon my ear; and the lonely dungeon in which I beheld my&s;elf enclo&s;ed, overwhelmed me with &s;o deadly a chillne&s;s, that the &s;hutting of my eyes appeared a degree of relief. Thought

ro&s;e tumultuou&s;ly on thought, 'till in one moment the terrible whole fla&s;hed upon my mind.

I &s;tarted up once more in wild de&s;pair; and wringing my hands, groaned forth his name in accents &s;o piercing, that they rou&s;ed the withered attendant allotted me, from her undi&s;co|vered pallet-bed at the foot of mine. Hurrying towards me, &s;he muttered &s;ome|thing I did not under&s;tand.

She ca&s;t down her eyes muttering, "Yes, my poor child, you are &s;en&s;ible by that que&s;tion." "Vain, vain hope! cried I, bur&s;ting into tears, and returning to my native tongue; yet oh! alive or dead, he is the all I re|quire; re&s;tore him, but re&s;tore him! a dear, a &s;acred duty attaches me even to his a&s;hes. Lead me to them, &s;ince they are all now left me, and allow me to lament at lei&s;ure." She &s;hrugged up her &s;houlders, implying &s;he did not thoroughly comprehend my language, and cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, denounced eternal perdition on me if I longer thought of a heretic, who &s;educed me from the true faith, and who of con&s;equence became a dreadful example of vengeance; charg|ing me to adore the holy Virgin Mother, who had by &s;o gentle a puni&s;hment re|called me to the Catholick church.

Alas! I perceived at the &s;ame moment, by the increa&s;ing number who now ga|thered round my bed, how vain either threats or intreaties mu&s;t prove in that in|&s;tance. The Superior approached, and in an authoritative deci&s;ive voice informed me, Lady Mortimer, in right of her re|lation&s;hip, had placed me entirely under their care and protection, relying on their pious endeavours both for the recovery of my rea&s;on and my principles: nor could I make &s;o good a u&s;e of the fir&s;t as to apply it &s;olely to the recovery of the latter, in|&s;tead of idly lamenting a lo&s;s which alone could have pre&s;erved my &s;oul.

called the noble hu&s;band, of whom their illiberal tenets had ju&s;t deprived me, an heretic; an outca&s;t of &s;ociety; a wretch not worthy interment. I heard without replying, but my &s;oul was not &s;ilent. I appealed to the Mo&s;t High, and he will not forget me. Oh! in the awful day of retribution, dreadfully will he di&s;tingui&s;h the bigotted dictators in religion!</P>
<P>Happily for me, they under&s;tood le&s;s of my language than I did of theirs; which perhaps &s;aved me from a har&s;hne&s;s which mu&s;t have added the ruin of my con&s;titu|tion to that of my peace.</P>
<P>You will be a&s;toni&s;hed, madam, at my &s;urviving &s;uch uncea&s;ing complicated mi&s;|fortunes, and, above all, the lo&s;s of my beloved. I regard it my&s;elf with wonder, and impute my &s;trength both of body and mind &s;olely to the knowing no pau&s;e in my &s;ufferings. Driven from one fatigue to another, from one agony to another, lamentation was continually &s;u&s;pended ei|ther by amazement, or that nece&s;&s;ity for exertion which gives a &s;pring to all but the weake&s;t minds, and counteracts de&s;pon|dency.

<P>Left at la&s;t with only that mi&s;erable companion, my own heart, I ruminated at lei&s;ure. Deprived of Lord Leice&s;ter, happine&s;s, revenge, name, fortune, every charm in exi&s;tence, every right in &s;oci|ety; entombed alive, ere the a&s;hes of my Lord were allotted a re&s;ting place, I re|viewed my whole fate with a&s;toni&s;hment. Often wearied with &s;uffering, did I me|ditate giving up a life no longer endeared to me, and quietly pur&s;uing my &s;oul's better part. Alas, the unborn cau&s;e of all my late dangers would &s;till recal, &s;till hold me down to &s;uffer! Yes, precious remnant of my love, &s;ole pledge of pa&s;t felicity; la&s;t of the mighty Dudley line, &s;ighed I, I owe thee the painful ble&s;&s;ing of exi&s;tence; I owe thy noble father's me|mory ju&s;tice.

<P>To effect any part of the&s;e complicated de&s;igns, I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tifle, in a degree, my feelings; and &s;ub|mitting to a di&s;&s;imulation my &s;oul abhor|red, I reque&s;ted to &s;ee that woman who was more terrible to my eyes than any thing human, Elizabeth excepted.

The jewels and mo|ney, both Lord Leice&s;ter and my&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, when we entered the fatal gates of Rouen, &s;eemed to have departed with him, as well as all information re&s;pecting the lodgment of tho&s;e &s;ums I have al|ready mentioned; and I &s;aw my&s;elf, for all that fortune once promi&s;ed me, inhe|riting only a weed.</P>
<P>As I endured with patience the religious vi&s;itations and homilies of the Nuns, as well tho&s;e of various Monks, who united with

This in&s;olent woman con|&s;idered the vi&s;it as a conde&s;cen&s;ion, and hardly held out a hand mine &s;huddered again to touch. Unmoved with my pale|ne&s;s, my condition, or my habit, &s;he calmly di&s;cour&s;ed with the &s;i&s;terhood and the Monks, while I continued drowned in tears no human effort could &s;tifle. A gentleman, who I under&s;tood was her younger &s;on, addre&s;t me with the voice of &s;ympathy; uninfluenced by his mo|ther's pious prejudices, he &s;poke of my misfortune as the fir&s;t on earth, and of Lord Leice&s;ter as the man who mo&s;t de|&s;erved to be lamented; and bewailed the delays in his pa&s;&s;age, which made him un|happily arrive too late to &s;uccour either. He &s;poke too in Engli&s;h. The words, the manner, the language, &s;unk into my &s;oul, and a &s;aint hope they &s;truck out en|abled me to &s;upport the en&s;uing conver|&s;ation. Lady Mortimer addre&s;t me with an air at once tenacious and haughty; treated me like a mere girl, who to a

It appeared the in|formation of our place of re&s;idence pa&s;&s;ed from her to Elizabeth, who bargained for the &s;ecret delivery of Lord Leice&s;ter to her emi&s;&s;aries: a reque&s;t Lady Mortimer complied with gladly, as the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t effectual means of re-uniting me to the Church. The plan of &s;eizing him at midnight, had, &s;he owned, been concert|ed by her&s;elf, as that was a time when he could neither re&s;i&s;t, nor I follow him, to create any alarm: a circum&s;tance &s;he dreaded beyond any other thing.

<P>I had in vain enquired for Mi&s;s Cecil; the Nuns a&s;&s;ured me they knew only from my delirium that &s;uch a per&s;on exi&s;ted, and Lady Mortimer inexorably refu&s;ed to inform me, whether &s;he &s;till did &s;o. Deeply I lamented the lo&s;s of the only friend who could have &s;oothed by &s;haring my affliction. Death had hallowed her pa&s;&s;ion with rights &s;carce inferior to my own, and my heart too frequently felt none but tho&s;e who loved could lament Lord Leice&s;ter as he merited.</P>
<P>Mr. Mortimer &s;oon became the medi|um between me and his mother; de&s;pair|ing to touch her impenetrable &s;oul, I employed every moment of loneli|ne&s;s in &s;ubduing her &s;on's.

babe for whom I &s;uffered &s;uch unremit|ting calamity, and dubious whether the pious policy of the nuns might not &s;natch it, as &s;oon as born, from my feeble arms, as well to en&s;ure my &s;tay as my abjuration, new terrors &s;prung up in my &s;oul. I could not but perceive an intere&s;ted mo|tive actuated him; reduced, however, to owe my freedom to any thing, I ap|peared blind to a tenderne&s;s every cir|cum&s;tance forbad him to avow. A very few days determined him, and he in|formed me he had &s;ecured an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, the crew of which were to be his only a&s;&s;i&s;tants. How &s;lowly is hope ex|tingui&s;hed, and oh, how &s;wiftly does it revive! actuated with the mo&s;t impatient de&s;ire of e&s;caping, I made even my grief &s;ub&s;ervient to it; and propo&s;ed to the nuns periodically to watch in the vault with Lord Leice&s;ter, (a &s;ad ceremony their religion permitted, and mine did not forbid) being told it would be ea&s;ier to force a way into this than the interior parts of the Convent.

Fortunately the night proved &s;everely cold, and ob&s;erving &s;he was no &s;harer in my penance, I re|commended to her to retire to her cell, and rejoin me when the mattins were over. Di&s;gu&s;ted with her employment, and already fro&s;t-nipt, &s;he &s;ullenly com|plied, and left me alone with the cof|fin of Lord Leice&s;ter&mdash;Lo&s;t hu&s;band of my choice!

An awful &s;ilence, which &s;eemed only in|terrupted by the throbbing of my pul&s;es, &s;ucceeded.

Offended at &s;o unexpect|ed a demand, he urged the difficulty and the danger, with a har&s;hne&s;s I thought him incapable of; neverthele&s;s, the place and time allowed not of long delibera|tion, and finding me inflexible, he at la&s;t ordered the &s;ailors to convey away the coffin likewi&s;e.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e horrors the ap|pointed hour revolved, and nature made her agonizing effort.

I perceived it was not without rea&s;on Mortimer had boa&s;ted of his authority: with overbearing in&s;o|lence he now demanded my hand, and bade me remember he was there a &s;ove|reign, nor did I &s;ee a being who dared even to murmur at his will.

<P>Tears, &s;ighs, and refu&s;als, could no longer avert or even delay the &s;acrifice; and having only a few hours of &s;olitude allowed, to prepare my mind for the cere|mony, I hu&s;hed my &s;miling babe at my aching brea&s;t, and wearied alike with mi|&s;ery and prayer, dropt into a &s;lumber.

<P>Fury now began to give place to fear; and the guilty wretches ha&s;tened their de|parture. The march commenced about midnight. Silent, bewildered, awe-&s;truck, I had meditated on this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ter|rible events, without extending my views

<P>As Emanuel &s;till walked by me, I &s;ought from him to under&s;tand the cau&s;e

of the pre&s;ent in&s;urrection, and the dif|ferent motives of him&s;elf and compani|ons. "Tho&s;e of the &s;laves, &s;aid that ge|nerous protector, are like their natures, wild and various&mdash;my own, &s;imply ju&s;|tice and love. The tyrannic Mortimer, who&s;e fate no being will ever deplore, e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in this i&s;land, no le&s;s by the favor of Philip the Second, than by marrying the &s;i&s;ter of the pre&s;ent Go|vernor, Don Pedro de Sylva. In that no|bleman he met a kindred mind; mean, mercenary, oppre&s;&s;ive, and cruel; in one particular alone they differed; Mortimer was by nature bold and enterprizing; Don Pedro cautious and timid. The enor|mities of the fir&s;t, however, always found &s;helter in the inju&s;tice of the latter; and Don Pedro not daring to carry on in his own per&s;on that piratical and illicit trade which alone can enrich individuals in the infancy of a &s;ettlement, &s;ecretly &s;hared with his brother-in-law the purcha&s;e and the profit, while Mortimer was the only o&s;ten&s;ible per&s;on, had any legal enquiry ari&s;en.

of Mortimer, received a fatal increa&s;e by the accumulation of wealth, and &s;et him above all re&s;traint, Don Pedro, con&s;cious he was in his power, ventured not to que&s;tion, much le&s;s puni&s;h his con|duct. The intervals between his frequent voyages de&s;troyed the peace, and &s;hor|tened the days of Donna Victoria, the uncomplaining victim of her brother's and hu&s;band's rapacious league.

Ungoverned and licentious in every in&s;tance, but more e&s;pecially when women were the objects, force generally was employed by Morti|mer, where fraud failed to &s;ucceed; and tho&s;e dome&s;tics, alone held rank in his fa|mily, who were readily &s;ub&s;ervient to his gro&s;s and vicious pur&s;uits.

Every complaint, or even &s;olicitation for my own, was &s;ilenced with the mo&s;t haughty threats of perpetual im|pri&s;onment: a &s;entence I often &s;aw in|flicted for no greater fault. Nor could I ever hope to quit the i&s;land, as the con|&s;ent of the Governor depended on that of Mortimer.

interpo&s;ition of Heaven in your fa|vor."</P>
<P>The nobility of &s;entiment incident to the Spani&s;h nation, e&s;pecially in whatever relates to the &s;ofter &s;ex, prevented that &s;urprize &s;o romantic as genero&s;ity mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned. To gratify a reque&s;t made with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, I entered into a recital of my own haple&s;s &s;tory. Aimor, with jealous care, adhered to that &s;ide of my hor&s;e not guarded by Emanuel; and not comprehending a word of the language in which I &s;poke, de|pended on his rival for tran&s;lating it; who no doubt, gave it every con&s;truction mo&s;t favorable to his own views. The infor|mation, that I was the daughter of a Queen, ran through the troop, and &s;oft|ened their ferocity: but &s;oon on that pom|pous di&s;tinction, were grounded vain hopes of &s;ome imaginary good they were all to derive from me&mdash;from me, who was, in fact, the mo&s;t helple&s;s and unprotected of all the mi&s;erable wanderers.</P>
<P>I pondered much on Emanuel's re|mark, that my &s;afety could only be a&s;cer|tained
<PB N="122" REF="124">
from our being overtaken; but when I con&s;idered the de&s;perate &s;tate of all with me, &s;hould that happen, hardly dared I hope it. Still we journeyed on|ward, through woods the &s;tars of Heaven could &s;carcely penetrate; and when I re|collected the frightful wilds and moun|tains beyond them, in which my&s;elf and babe mu&s;t infallibly be buried for life, how did my heart die within me! But when to that fear was added the dread of evils yet more horrible, hardly could my &s;en&s;es &s;upport the oppre&s;&s;ion. Aimor, I was convinced, would not want the aid of his whole party, and how could I hope one generous individual would be able to &s;truggle with a tide of combining foes? But even if Emanuel had the addre&s;s to ma|nage them all, would not expectations in his own favor, hardly le&s;s fearful to my thoughts, ari&s;e in his heart? Through the chill windings of the de&s;ert woods, I rai&s;ed my &s;oul to him who&s;e eye pervades alike the gloom of midnight and the blaze of noon, and &s;omething &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ure my &s;inking &s;pirits, he re&s;cued me

not from the horrors of the Rece&s;s, thus to abandon me.&mdash;I did not err in that devout confidence. The dawn of day obliging the body to be more guarded in their march, they cho&s;e a lone hollow, and halted to &s;end forth &s;couts, and re|fre&s;h them&s;elves. Alas, I &s;ighed for the poor wretches, who, &s;educed by European crimes to a dire imitation of them, had wanted fore&s;ight to procure them&s;elves the common comforts, which alone ren|der life endurable, though overwhelmed with gaudy trifles they knew not how to enjoy.</P>
<P>The temporary calm into which they &s;unk, was fearfully interrupted. The &s;couts &s;ent out pre&s;&s;ed back, with imme|diate notice that they were intercepted, and &s;o hemmed in that it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed a mile farther. Though by this notice my own &s;afety was a&s;certained, my very &s;oul partook the mi&s;ery of my companion. The wretched women threw their arms, for the la&s;t time, round, their de&s;pairing hu&s;bands, and bathed them with tears &s;o bitter, as might wa&s;h out
<PB N="124" REF="126">
the &s;tains of blood yet recent. The men, thus totally devoted, with a &s;tern and un|altered brow, &s;eized their arms, and re|&s;olved to ru&s;h upon the broken parties, gracing their own death, by making the lo&s;s equal to their enemies. Even &s;ome of their wives, rendered furious by the occa&s;ion, followed with &s;uch &s;cattered weapons as they could collect, and the re&s;t, no le&s;s tamed, gathered them&s;elves and haple&s;s children round me, as if I could pre&s;erve them; pur&s;uing their friends with a cry might &s;hake the throne of mercy. Aimor and Emanuel ca&s;t a lingering eye towards the foot of that tree at which I &s;at, apparently the Queen of Sorrow. It was dreadful to make a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction at that moment, and perhaps embitter their la&s;t. Laying my babe upon my lap, I tendered a hand to each; the boon was eagerly accepted. Even the &s;avage became humanized, an impa&s;&s;ioned tear fell on the hand that &s;huddered at his touch; while Emanuel, more gracefully ob&s;equious, bowed to the earth, then over the offered hand, and
<PB N="125" REF="127">
removing his ardent eye from my face to that of his rival&mdash;"Adieu, mo&s;t wor&s;hip|ped of women! cried the gallant Spaniard, adieu, for ever! How many evils does death &s;ave us all from!"</P>
<P>During the horrible interval of blood and &s;laughter, I endeavoured to clo&s;e my ears to the &s;ound of the firing, which was echoed by the agonized groans of the wretches around me. The conflict was &s;hort; and bands of Europeans pierced through tho&s;e &s;hades, where a few mi|nutes had made &s;o many helple&s;s widows. Tho&s;e guilty, but unfortunate women, pro&s;trating them&s;elves before the pre&s;ent|ed pieces, endeavoured, by the mo&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures, and offers of their chil|dren, to a&s;&s;uage the wrath of the incen&s;|ed victors. I feebly aro&s;e likewi&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ing forward to the apparent leader, a&s;toni&s;hed him with the &s;ight of a white among the &s;urvivors. I exhau&s;ted my little remaining &s;trength in &s;oliciting pro|tection for my&s;elf and child, and pity for my companions. He heard, without com|prehending me; his very &s;oul was in|tently

fixed on the &s;cattered riches this reduction of the &s;laves put into his hands, and neither my&s;elf, my daughter, or my fate, &s;eemed an object worth re|gard.

<P>Emerging from the depth of tho&s;e un|whole&s;ome woods, through which I had wandered, I lifted my eyes devoutly to|wards that ri&s;ing orb, which &s;eems no le&s;s to give light to the mind than the crea|tion: and called on the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the future, to counteract the horrible impre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;t. Re&s;tored by this extraordinary means once more to civi|lized &s;ociety, my heart acknowledged the charm, the &s;imple, the &s;olitary charm of liberty, and &s;pringing forward toward England, overleaped every intervening ob&s;tacle.

<P>The curio&s;ity I had at fir&s;t excited among the whole party, extended not be|yond common enquiries, and as I &s;poke no Spani&s;h, and French was but indiffer|ently under&s;tood by either, them or my|&s;elf, I could hardly hope greatly to inter|e&s;t them in my favor.

Confounded with tho&s;e per&s;ecuted wretches&mdash;un&s;heltered from the taunts, in&s;ults, and execrations of an incen&s;ed populace, I found my&s;elf yet the victim of angry fortune; and over-worn with &s;uffering, dropt &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the door of a pri&s;on, where I under&s;tood my journey was to end. I revived on a mi&s;erable bed, in a dark room, without any companions; but con&s;cious of &s;afety, as well as free from guilt, I recommend|ed my&s;elf to God, and &s;unk into the hap|pie&s;t repo&s;e I had known &s;ince I pa&s;&s;ed the fatal gates of Rouen.</P>
<P>A black &s;lave brought me &s;ome coar&s;e provi&s;ions in the morning, nor did I know till the evening that it was meant to &s;u&s;|tain my&s;elf and child for the day. It proved, however, more than &s;ufficient; for my con&s;titution, which had hitherto

re&s;i&s;ted every danger, had now received a &s;hock of the mo&s;t de&s;perate kind. Racked with intolerable pains through all my limbs, I was &s;en&s;ible, too late, that my own imprudence had added a malady of body to all my mental &s;ufferings. Dur|ing the la&s;t awful conflict, when the of|fending rebels expiated with life the ra|vages they had committed, I, in common with the females they had left behind, had thrown my&s;elf on the damp ground, alike through wearine&s;s and terror. The unwhole&s;ome chills from a &s;pot which yet the &s;un never penetrated, &s;tiffened every joint; a rheumatic fever was the cruel con&s;equence. Alone, uncomfort|ed, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, con&s;umed by an internal raging fire, I groaned, I &s;hrieked, with inten&s;e torture. The &s;tarts and cries of my little one; alone informed me I had done &s;o; I hu&s;hed her on a bo&s;om I fear|ed would &s;corch her, and eagerly &s;wal|lowing whatever liquid was brought me, had hardly intervals of &s;en&s;e enough to &s;hare it with my babe, or &s;ufficiently to, provide for her nouri&s;hment. The days of

<P>When returning rea&s;on allowed me to extend my reflections beyond the pre&s;ent evil, I recollected from the time elap&s;ed, that my impri&s;onment mu&s;t be decided and perpetual. Emanuel had told me the Governor was timid, mean, and avarici|ous; forgetful of this, I had informed my conductors of the family tye between my&s;elf and Mortimer; which rendering me his natural heir, this unworthy Go|vernor had doubtle&s;s annihilated my claim to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he was re&s;olved to appro|priate, by cla&s;&s;ing me with the murder|ers, among whom I was found: and by an arbitrary proceeding, (not uncommon there, if Emanuel might be relied on) &s;entenced me at once, not daring to ven|ture a judicial enquiry. The languor in|cident to &s;uch ince&s;&s;arit &s;ufferings, both of body and mind, as I had for a cour&s;e of time endured, rendered me le&s;s &s;hocked and grieved at this, than many other con|tingencies.

It &s;eemed in my power to die, and di&s;appoint the malice of my op|pre&s;&s;ors. It was only to remit a little, a very little care of my&s;elf, and my con&s;ti|tution would finally give way. Perhaps I &s;hould have delivered my&s;elf wholly up to this idea, but that the fir&s;t great tie of nature, &s;till wound round my bleeding heart.

<P>Ah, Madam, it is only in the early &s;ea|&s;ons of heavy vi&s;itation we dare to repine; when mi&s;ery once reaches the extreme, it has always &s;alutary effects.

<P>When I pondered over the infinite and various advantages my daughter might derive from the partiality of a woman, who&s;e authority was great enough to open the doors of our pri&s;on, my heart became &s;en&s;ible of hopes in her favor, I had long cea&s;ed to indulge in my own; and re&s;ign|ing my&s;elf to the pro&s;pect, I &s;unk into a repo&s;e which might almo&s;t be called hap|py, A &s;hort time habituated me to pe|riodically parting with, and receiving my daughter, always laden with &s;ome little

<P>The total ignorance in which my daughter's mind yet remained, &s;hocked and grieved me.

Charm|ed to find it in my power to render my|&s;elf intelligible to her, I related briefly my &s;tory, which her complacency a&s;&s;ured me &s;he did not half under&s;tand. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I comprehend|ed from her, that Don Pedro de Sylva, the unju&s;t Governor, who had condemned me without examination, was at length dead; that &s;he had for &s;ome time pa&s;t been his favorite, and u&s;ed the influence that title gave her to indulge her fond|ne&s;s for my child, and lighten my cap|tivity: that it had always been as much

in her power to vi&s;it my pri&s;on as now, but not finding any certain crime imputed to me, and &s;ure if I could acquit my&s;elf of the &s;u&s;picion, &s;he &s;hould become warm|ly intere&s;ted in my favor, (perhaps to the degree of exa&s;perating the benefactor &s;he might then be obliged, to de&s;pi&s;e) &s;he wi&s;ely forbore gratifying her generous cu|rio&s;ity, and contented her&s;elf with be|&s;towing &s;uch marks of her attachment as would not interfere with the rights of the Governor, or dimini&s;h her own. Final|ly, that death had &s;natched away the only man who could re&s;train her inclinations; and as he had bequeathed her a con&s;ider|able portion of his wealth, &s;he had be|&s;towed a part of it, to obtain from the new Governor a remi&s;&s;ion of my &s;en|tence; and having &s;ucceeded, now came to a&s;&s;ure me, I &s;hould be at liberty to re|turn to Europe; for which voyage her friend&s;hip would amply &s;upply me with means, company, and attendance as it was her purpo&s;e to quit for ever a coun|try, where &s;he had lo&s;t her only connec|tion,

<P>During this di&s;cour&s;e, I thought my &s;en&s;es almo&s;t failed me.

I rai&s;ed my &s;oul to him who gave tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, and breathed life into the elements which &s;u&s;tain them, and be&s;ought him to moderate my feelings, or conden&s;e them all in gratitude.</P>

<P>I STRUGGLED with the &s;ad remem|brances indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on my heart, when my eyes again beheld the &s;hore of England; and folding to my bo&s;om the dear offspring of love and misfortune, I &s;hut up every &s;en&s;e in her.

of our voyage. I landed at Greenwich, becau&s;e the &s;pot where I could &s;oone&s;t learn intelligence of the Sydney family, as the people who kept the chief inn, I remembered, had been &s;ervants to Lord Leice&s;ter: alas, I had overlooked the long term of my ab&s;ence, and the probability that they might either be dead or removed. Greenwich, which I had &s;een the &s;eat of gaiety, empire, and magnificence, now appeared a dreary &s;o|litude. The tide in &s;ilence laved the walls of a de&s;erted palace, which verging to decay like its pa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, &s;eemed but a gaudy mau&s;oleum. I pau&s;ed over the&s;e fragile memorials of human grandeur, as the boat bore me towards the &s;hore; and half &s;urmi&s;ed the &s;trangene&s;s that might await me there. I was pre&s;ently &s;ur|rounded by a &s;et of unknown faces; and after much tedious enquiry, learnt that my tender friend, Lady Arundell, &s;till inhabited her hou&s;e near Chel&s;ea, whither I di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger with a billet. It demanded "a welcome for a poor widowed wanderer, and a babe, for who&s;e
<PB N="153" REF="155">
exi&s;tence that dear woman was perhaps re&s;pon&s;ible, as it was wholly owing to her indulgence. I added, I would not ven|ture one enquiry till I gained fortitude from her pre&s;ence, but doubted not I &s;hould have as much to learn as to unfold. If, as my flattering forebodings informed me, my darling &s;i&s;ter yet &s;urvived, I was per&s;uaded by whatever name &s;he was now di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;he would once more an|&s;wer to that with tran&s;port; and fold to her glowing bo&s;om a weary heart, which had long fought in vain a re&s;ting place; but I &s;ubmitted the di&s;covery, and meet|ing, &s;olely to the care and prudence of our mutual friend."</P>
<P>I waited not long in &s;u&s;pence, for my me&s;&s;enger ha&s;tened back with a billet, in|coherent as &s;urprize and joy could make it. "Fly, &s;aid the generous Lady Arun|dell, to my arms, to my heart, to my home&mdash;they will ever be open to you and yours&mdash;I &s;u&s;pend all explanations till I &s;ee you.&mdash;Ah Matilda, dear to my eyes will be that lovely face, however changed by misfortune."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">
Grateful as this invitation proved, my &s;oul was &s;en&s;ible of a damp and di&s;ap|pointment, from the ob&s;curity ca&s;t over the interval of my ab&s;ence, and her leav|ing unan&s;wered my enquiry for my &s;i&s;ter. I ha&s;tened neverthele&s;s to obey the re|que&s;t. The &s;ad meditations which would have engro&s;&s;ed my faculties in pa&s;&s;ing through London, were continually inter|rupted by the tran&s;ports of my little Ma|ry; the varying &s;treets filled with gay &s;hops, and thronged with fine-dre&s;&s;ed people, were a novelty to her of the mo&s;t charming and intere&s;ting nature. Ere I could half an&s;wer her enquiry into each new wonder, it was lo&s;t in the next, and that cha&s;tened plea&s;ure a mother ex|tracts from blending the &s;igh of know|ledge with the &s;mile of innocence, claim|ed its turn in my agitated bo&s;om, &s;u&s;|pending more powerful emotions: but when my eyes re&s;ted on the gates of Lady Arundell's hou&s;e, tho&s;e gates from whence I la&s;t took my flight &s;o dearly accompa|nied, a pang &s;o pungent wrung my heart, that my feeble &s;en&s;e &s;unk under it, and I

&s;wooned away. I revived; and it &s;eemed rather by the cries and tears of my little one, than the remedies of the &s;ervants who &s;urrounded me. My &s;weet Mary had climbed up the couch on which they laid me, and cla&s;p|ing her arms round my neck, laid her mantling cheek to my pale one, and &s;hed deluges of tears. I comforted her, and feeling my hand pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome body who &s;at almo&s;t behind me, turned, and fixing my eyes on the &s;treaming ones of Lady Arundull; I threw my&s;elf &s;ilently into her arms, and felt my very &s;oul di&s;|&s;olve upon her bo&s;om. Both were half &s;uffocated with feelings too high wrought, and the pre&s;ence of my daughter proved a fortunate relief; for drawing me fondly down to her, "why do you cry, mama? &s;aid the dear one, and why does this lady cry? I thought we came home to be hap|py." "And happy we will be, my dar|ling, cried Lady Arundell, pre&s;&s;ing her to a bo&s;om melting in her favor, who can be otherwi&s;e ble&s;t with &s;uch a cherub? Can you complain, Matilda, when Heaven has

left you her?"&mdash;"No, my admirable friend, &s;ighed I, I do not complain,&mdash;my rea&s;on reproves tho&s;e tears my wound|ed heart will not cea&s;e periodically to pour forth; this hou&s;e; this room, even your tenderne&s;s awakens a train of killing remembrances, I have in vain endeavour|ed to arm my&s;elf again&s;t. Here, here, even here has my &s;oul expanded towards her father, with a plea&s;ure of which her|&s;elf, and this weed, are the only memo|rials."</P>
<P>The entrance of &s;ervants with refre&s;h|ments, &s;u&s;pended a little the agitation of both; and Lady Arundell ob&s;tinately re|fu&s;ed every kind of information concern|ing my &s;i&s;ter or friends till the next day, in&s;i&s;ting I &s;hould devote the remainder of the evening to a minute recital of my own &s;tory. The a&s;toni&s;hment its inci|dents every moment excited in Lady Arundell, &s;eemed to make it more won|derful even to my&s;elf. Having the happy a&s;&s;urance from her that my &s;i&s;ter &s;till lived, I gave way to the &s;weet hope of &s;eeing her, and filled up with her idea a cham|ber
<PB N="157" REF="159">
which now appeared more &s;olitary than ever.</P>
<P>My impatience concerning my Ellinor could no longer be re&s;trained, and when we met in the morning, I importunately demanded her &s;tory. The vi&s;ible reluc|tance with which Lady Arundell granted my reque&s;t, confirmed my fears of &s;ome dreadful cata&s;trophe, and had I not been a&s;&s;ured my &s;i&s;ter yet lived, I &s;hould have concluded her lo&s;s the fatal event our friend feared to acknowledge: but &s;atis|fied in this in&s;tance, and having no tie which could comparatively intere&s;t me, I fortified my mind again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of inferior &s;orrows, by the deep &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e I had already &s;urvived.</P>
<P>Whatever courage I had collected, I needed it all, when with that fearful pomp of preparation with which friend&s;hip ever binds up the wounds of fate, Lady Arun|dell produced a number of papers, mo&s;t of which appeared to be written by my &s;i&s;ter. I ki&s;&s;ed the dear traces of a hand &s;o beloved. Alas, tho&s;e &s;heets are yet by me, and I need only copy them.</P>

<P>OH, you! much loved, but little tru&s;ted, dear &s;i&s;ter of my heart, whom it fondly pur&s;ues through unknown climes, where yet perhaps you wander, the victim of a fatal attachment; receive in the&s;e papers, if they ever meet your eyes, the la&s;t te&s;timony of an affection, which as it was the fir&s;t my &s;oul became &s;en&s;ible to, &s;o &s;urely will it be the la&s;t.

&s;ame moment your duty. Ah! no, I remembered Williams, and was from that moment prudent, if not happy&mdash;yet as I know too well the horrors of my&s;tery, in|certitude, and &s;ilence, (for have I not &s;pent ages in vainly gue&s;&s;ing at your fate?) let me re&s;cue you from a life of &s;urmi&s;e, by peru&s;ing this &s;ad memorial.

<P>In one part of this &s;tory I mu&s;t ever have been ob&s;cure and in&s;incere, but that Heaven has &s;natched away the wor&s;hipped object, of who&s;e character we judged in &s;o different a manner. Oh, pardon me all-gracious Heaven, if my opinion has been erroneous!&mdash;Pau&s;e here, Matilda, if your ri&s;ing &s;oul has taken the alarm, and weigh
<PB N="160" REF="162">
well the love you bear me, for I &s;hall need it all, unle&s;s I fal&s;ify the fact.</P>
<P>On the memorable day, when Heaven decided the de&s;tiny of the one &s;i&s;ter, and perplexed that of the other, by pre&s;enting to the eyes of both the favorite of Eliza|beth, how diametrically oppo&s;ite were the impre&s;&s;ions each took of his character! A&s;toni&s;hing that two agreeing in every in&s;tance till that moment, &s;hould for the fir&s;t time differ in &s;o decided a manner! more a&s;toni&s;hing, that every following day only confirmed the &s;eparate judg|ments. The darling alike of art and of nature, the eye, or mind, could demand no more than was comprized in the per|&s;on of Lord Leice&s;ter&mdash;but here, in my opinion, the charm ended. His heart, not warm by nature, had been rendered in a great degree callous, from having always pa&s;&s;ed his life in the chilling at|mo&s;phere of a Court. Unbounded in his projects, timid and &s;ubtile in his actions, tyrannick in his pur&s;uits, the object he could not govern could never long attach him. Ambition, pride, and vanity, tho&s;e
<PB N="161" REF="163">
leading traits in almo&s;t every character, were in his &s;o exqui&s;itely blended, and corrected by the fro&s;t of his nature, that they might often be mi&s;taken for nobler pa&s;&s;ions. You were pre&s;ented to his eyes in early youth, a fini&s;hed pattern of beau|ty, endued with royalty; in the fir&s;t ten|der bloom of a newly awakened love. Uniting thus in your own per&s;on the &s;tronge&s;t powers of charming, with &s;uch as were peculiarly congenial to the heart you wi&s;hed to win, it laid it&s;elf at your feet. Oh woful moment when it did &s;o, as it entailed upon you all the mi&s;eries of a mutual pa&s;&s;ion, without half its enjoy|ments! Alas, Matilda, had you really been adored&mdash;yet what could that have done, more than to &s;everely aggravate all you was born to &s;uffer? and as the ap|parent pa&s;&s;ion of Lord Leice&s;ter had to you the charms of reality, I am to blame perhaps thus to repre&s;ent it: but the &s;ea|&s;on of di&s;&s;imulation is pa&s;t, and my tor|tured heart will utter nothing but truth. So fixed was my opinion of his character, that though there was a moment of my
<PB N="162" REF="164">
life, when my fate &s;eemed wholly in Lord Leice&s;ter's hands, I could not then enough e&s;teem him to venture his deci&s;ion. Yet &s;till a tender pity for your unmerited and everla&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this (in your mind) har&s;h judgment, but that, I once more repeat, my own actions mu&s;t ever then have appeared eccentric and enigmatical.</P>
<P>How deeply both father Anthony and I regretted the imprudence which intro|duced into our &s;olitary a&s;ylum &s;o danger|ous a vi&s;itor, it were needle&s;s now to repeat. Prudence was for once on the &s;ide of pa&s;|&s;ion, and your fate was by the will of your only remaining guardian, for ever united with that of your lover, I &s;oon found it vain to oppo&s;e the a&s;cendency he had gained in your affections; and as my own were yet unoccupied, I looked no far|ther than the pre&s;ent moment; and followed you to Kenilworth Ca&s;tle without repin|ing. Neverthele&s;s I admired the delu&s;i|ons of love, which in a moment recon|ciled you to a &s;ituation apparently &s;o ob|&s;cure and abject; and &s;till more that total
<PB N="163" REF="165">
blindne&s;s to your own exqui&s;ite perfection, which could make you fancy that low &s;tate would ever appear to ob&s;erving &s;pectators your natural one. What then mu&s;t be my a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee Lord Leice&s;ter's love impo&s;e &s;uch humiliations, on an ob|ject nature and fortune had placed &s;o far above him, and meanly content him&s;elf with monopolized indulgences.</P>
<P>Scarce were we alone, when the pre|&s;umption of that wretch Williams filled both of us with a terror which required an immediate remedy. Every faculty of my &s;oul revolted again&s;t the abject com|pliances your entreaties exacted from me; but even tho&s;e only &s;erved to &s;trengthen the contempt which began to predomi|nate in it. Lord Leice&s;ter's return gave us a temporary relief, but his method of getting rid of the villain, appeared to me alike un&s;afe and mean, and the only proper mode of ending our fears never once &s;eemed to occur to him. I mean, acknowledg|ing his marriage; which perhaps might at that period have been done without any great danger of offending Elizabeth;
<PB N="164" REF="166">
who&s;e withering heart was becoming every day le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of affection, and who&s;e vanity was &s;o highly gratified and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed by the vi&s;it of the Duke of Anjou. But it was the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of my Lord to break the match with the French Prince, and to that golden idol his every pa&s;&s;ion bow|ed. We were again left to work tape&s;try, and when he had &s;ucceeded in his fa|vourite project, he left the Queen in turn, to bewail alone the lo&s;s of her la&s;t lover, and came once more to amu&s;e him&s;elf at Kenilworth.</P>
<P>But he was not always to &s;ucceed; the jealou&s;y of Elizabeth had now ju&s;t pro|vocation, and in her &s;udden arrival at Kenilworth Ca&s;tle, &s;he at la&s;t over-reached her politick favorite. In vain he would have concealed us&mdash;in vain he would have repre&s;ented us as the va&s;&s;als of his amu&s;ement: the &s;crutinizing eye of the Queen, the univer&s;al voice of her more impartial train, pronounced this impo&s;&s;i|ble. Reduced to frame a new &s;tory, tor|tured with the conviction that it had not gained credit, he was obliged to aggra|vate

every di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, by delivering us unwil|lingly into the hands of Elizabeth.

<P>Ah, how vi&s;ionary &s;eems on recollec|tion our new &s;ituation! &s;een without be|ing known; adored, without being e&s;teem|ed; puni&s;hed, without being guilty; ap|plauded, without being meritorious, we were all an illu&s;ion. Yet &s;urrounded with &s;pies, and acting for ever under an eye di&s;po&s;ed to condemn, ere it could half di&s;cover, how difficult was it for us to avoid &s;u&s;picion and cen&s;ure! One &s;ole advan|tage had either gained by converging into the &s;phere of a court; a faithful friend:

though even that ble&s;&s;ing was curtailed by the eternal policy of my Lord, who would not permit us to confide even to his own amiable nieces, the Ladies Arun|dell and Pembroke, any part of a &s;ecret which might affect, however remotely, his own &s;afety.

<P>Lord Pembroke's partiality had long di&s;tingui&s;hed a noble youth the policy of Lord Leice&s;ter &s;till kept abroad. I had &s;een many of his letters, through the me|dium of Lady Pembroke; and my heart had learnt to flutter at the name of E&s;&s;ex, ere yet I beheld him. Alas, even while I repeat it, I own the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation!&mdash;Oh, love! exqui&s;ite delu&s;ion! captivating error! from the moment the lips find plea&s;ure in that word, till they lo&s;e the power of pronouncing it, the charm, the inconceivable charm remains.&mdash;Whether cheri&s;hed by the &s;unbeams of hope, or chilled by the dews of di&s;appointment&mdash;Whether the cho&s;en object is faithful, or unfaithful&mdash;glowing with animation be|fore our eyes, or &s;eared up in the dark and &s;ilent grave; the pa&s;&s;ion, the power|ful pa&s;&s;ion a&s;&s;erts its eternal influence, and decides the character where it once has reigned.

<P>Tinctured with the partiality of Lord E&s;&s;ex's friends; already acquainted with his &s;entiments on heroi&s;m, glory, and every attachment, except that of the heart; I fondly flattered my&s;elf the day would come, when he would receive from me that la&s;t and livelie&s;t pa&s;&s;ion which forms and fini&s;hes the human &s;oul. I interwove my&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly in all his concerns; I deeply lamented the tie of relation&s;hip, which &s;ubjected his actions to the will of Lord Leice&s;ter; and employed &s;ome of the little time I &s;pent with my Lord, in endeavoring to bias his mind in favor of the ab&s;ent hero. Cold and &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of E&s;&s;ex's merits, Lord Leice&s;ter often bantered me on being &s;o &s;en&s;ible of them, and &s;eldom failed to remind me of the family compact, which had bound Lord E&s;&s;ex to wed Sir Francis Wal&s;ing|ham's only daughter: to fulfil which, he purpo&s;ed &s;oon to recal him; and advi&s;ed
<PB N="169" REF="171">
me rather to turn my eyes on Sir Walter Raleigh, who&s;e talents he pronounced infinitely &s;uperior, and who&s;e homage was wholly paid to me. As this was a lover he knew I dete&s;ted, the conver&s;a|tion generally ended when he was named, but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es con|firmed me in the opinion of Lord Lei|ce&s;ter's &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and prepared me, per|haps, to decide in oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex was at length &s;ummoned to Eng|land. He arrived. An idle, unaccountable apprehen&s;ion at once overcame my rea&s;on. I was per&s;uaded I could not &s;ee him with indifference. I feared the keen eye of Elizabeth, and the colder and more watch|ful one of Lord Leice&s;ter. I quitted the Court the day he was to be pre&s;ented, and pa&s;t it with Lady Pembroke. By a &s;in|gular chance Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham had cho&s;en to do the &s;ame. The party enlarged in|&s;en&s;ibly as the circle decrea&s;ed. E&s;&s;ex was the theme of every tongue, and while Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham's triumphant eyes ac|knowledged the implied compliments, my yielding heart received them. "He
<PB N="170" REF="172">
is here," cried Lady Pembroke, in the afternoon, looking out of the window, and ki&s;&s;ing her hand. I felt ready once more to run away, but that decorum re|&s;trained me. Lady Pembroke indulged one of the gay whims which &s;o often were a &s;ource of plea&s;ure at once to her&s;elf and her friends, and in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould only be told his bride was among the unmarried ladies, from whom his heart mu&s;t &s;elect her. It was an ill-judged project. Mi&s;s Wal|&s;ingham had been contracted to Lord E&s;|&s;ex in childhood, rather to ratify a recon|ciliation between the families, than with any idea of a future affection. The rigid principles of Lady Wal&s;ingham had hi|therto kept her daughter in total &s;eclu&s;ion, and the death of her mother had now given the young lady unbounded liberty. Her pa&s;&s;ions, naturally violent, had al|ways &s;purned re&s;traint; but compelled for a time to &s;ubmit to it, they marked her character even in early youth with haugh|tine&s;s. The beauty &s;he eminently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;oon drew around her a croud of lovers, which elevating her vanity, added
<PB N="171" REF="173">
coquetry to pride, and united in her per|&s;on the &s;trange extremes of &s;our re&s;erve and unbounded levity. Sir Philip Sydney was the only man &s;uppo&s;ed to have any intere&s;t in her heart, but as he had from the fir&s;t devoted him&s;elf to another, &s;he affected to de&s;pi&s;e him, and wait the re|turn of her allotted hu&s;band, with a re&s;o|lution to accept of him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham &s;econded the pro|po&s;al of Lady Pembroke, which rather per|plexed the re&s;t of the company; and after much plea&s;antry on the &s;ubject of &s;ympa|thy, Lady Pembroke &s;ent for her Lord and the &s;tranger.&mdash;Ah, Heavens, that invincible &s;tranger&mdash;born to decide my de&s;tiny&mdash;his youth had accu&s;tomed me to expect to find &s;omething unformed and unfini&s;hed in his per&s;on and manners&mdash;how then was I &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the height and maje&s;ty of Lord Leice&s;ter united with features no le&s;s perfect; while every grace of figure, feature, and complexion, were lighted up by brilliant youth, an air at once elegant and ingenuous, and an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ibility like that he could

with pride and plea&s;ure the di&s;tingui&s;hed choice his heart had ventured to make.

<P>I left him behind and returned to Court; glowing with the &s;ame ardent pa&s;&s;ion I had once dared to condemn in you, and flattering my&s;elf he was already &s;tudying how to break an engagement not ratified by his heart. How &s;weet were the hours, rich with that hope! ready every moment to acknowledge the truth, and to indulge my pa&s;&s;ion by repo&s;ing it in your faithful bo&s;om, I found you over|whelmed with tears, apprehen&s;ion, and angui&s;h; for it was at this very period the cruel and extravagant jealou&s;y of Lord Leice&s;ter became apparent. Wanting courage to mention an incident remote
<PB N="174" REF="176">
from the cau&s;e of your &s;orrow, I buried the dear impre&s;&s;ion in my heart, and devoted my&s;elf to &s;oothing a mind &s;o deeply wounded. By a &s;trange tran&s;ition in my own &s;entiments, I had learnt fairly to judge of yours, and the increa&s;ing &s;i|milarity interwove our &s;ouls every day more and more &s;trongly, though not one word e&s;caped me. Dreams of pride and grandeur, which had &s;ometimes embit|tered a &s;pirit I will venture to call noble, vani&s;hed at once before a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;i|on; which &s;trangely filled up that void in my mind nothing yet had ever been able to fill. I no longer complained of the Queen&mdash;I no longer thought the Court a pri&s;on&mdash;conforming from that moment quietly to my fate, I centered every wi&s;h in one &s;ole object.</P>
<P>I even employed my&s;elf diligently in developing Lord Leice&s;ter's &s;entiments; and conciliating a difference both of you &s;uffered alike by, though neither would allow it. Lord E&s;&s;ex, during the&s;e con|ver&s;ations, was ever near us&mdash;with watch|ful eye endeavouring to dive into the na|ture
<PB N="175" REF="177">
of our connection, and the my&s;tery of our birth; &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly buried by Leice&s;ter and Elizabeth. The di&s;|gu&s;t your Lord already &s;hewed towards E&s;&s;ex, became on the&s;e occa&s;ions more marked, and as its cau&s;e, I &s;ought by every little di&s;tinction to reward that dear lover's patience: a di&s;like &s;o unju&s;t, heightened, however, that I already felt towards Lord Leice&s;ter, though at the &s;ame moment it &s;upplied a &s;till more urgent rea&s;on for con|cealing it, than tho&s;e which had hitherto influenced me.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of your mind &s;unk into mine; and profiting by the &s;ad example of a pa&s;&s;ion imprudently indulged, I call|ed my&s;elf to account for cheri&s;hing &s;o dangerous a weakne&s;s, and re&s;olved by a courageous effort to govern, if I could not extingui&s;h it. But, ah, how vain is that attempt, when once we are truly touched! Love, my &s;i&s;ter, like the en|writhed &s;erpent, only compre&s;&s;es the heart more clo&s;ely, for every effort we make to &s;hake it off. In vain I turned my con|templations towards the ob&s;curity which
<PB N="176" REF="178">
had hitherto attended our lives, the dark and my&s;terious cloud which yet hung over them; love drew a vivid rainbow acro&s;s it, and every tear due to misfortune fell tinctured with E&s;&s;ex. Ah, wherefore &s;hould calamity heighten that pa&s;&s;ion? without being able to define the cau&s;e, I acknowledge the effect? The heart forever active, perhaps then ferments mo&s;t powerfully, and where love has once found room, every agitation co|operates to its increa&s;e, however di&s;tinct its origin.</P>
<P>Yet if the weakne&s;s of woman could be ju&s;tified by the merit of the object, the more I examined E&s;&s;ex, the more rea|&s;on I had to be &s;atisfied. That noble candor, which re&s;i&s;ted through life the courtly artifice, he neither knew to profit by or adopt, was at this period eminently con&s;picuous: while his warm heart, and poli&s;hed under&s;tanding, made him no le&s;s the friend than the patron of genius. Every indifferent &s;pectator admired to &s;ee even his youth rich with every promi&s;e fulfilled in the riper years of Sydney, and thought
<PB N="177" REF="179">
Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham the happie&s;t of men, in being able to match his daugh|ter with either of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed minds. The generous E&s;&s;ex &s;corned to deceive her he did not refu&s;e to marry, and paying his decea&s;ed father's will the deep re&s;pect of appearing ready to comply with it, waited the operations of fortune in his favor, and adored me in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>At this juncture the camp claimed Lord Leice&s;ter, and the nobility accompanied him. I &s;hared the mortal chagrin with which you &s;aw him depart in &s;ilence, and followed you &s;o truly through all your feelings, that I &s;ought to per&s;uade my|&s;elf E&s;&s;ex might only want the power to treat me in the &s;ame manner. This pain|ful idea operated &s;o &s;trongly, as to make me a&s;&s;ume a coldne&s;s at parting, to which E&s;&s;ex was wholly unaccu&s;tomed, and which, to own the truth, I did not cea&s;e regretting the whole time of his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>The di&s;per&s;ion and defeat of the Ar|mada re&s;tored gaiety and eclat to the Court. The fulle&s;t reconciliation took
<PB N="178" REF="180">
place between you and Lord Leice&s;ter. My heart opened once more to hope, to happine&s;s, to E&s;&s;ex; who now took cou|rage to unfold his &s;entiments to Lady Pembroke. She in&s;tantly adopted his cau&s;e, and promi&s;ed to find him an op|portunity to plead it. Nor was it long ere &s;he drew me to her hou&s;e, and telling me, with one of tho&s;e happy &s;miles which di&s;po&s;ed us to grant whatever &s;he wi&s;hed, "that from the fir&s;t moment &s;he &s;aw me, it had been one of the darling objects of her life to unite me with Lord E&s;&s;ex, who alone appeared to her likely to de|&s;erve the heart &s;he had &s;o thoroughly &s;tu|died, &s;he had engaged her Lord to join with her in concerting that mode of introduction which appeared to me &s;o wild a whim. It had fully an&s;wered her hopes in fa&s;cinating one of the parties, and, &s;he added, &s;he half believed it was not lo&s;t upon the other." Fixing her eyes for a moment on my glowing cheeks, &s;he gaily &s;tarted up to throw open her clo&s;et door, "in &s;hort, my dear, cried &s;he, here is my Lord him|&s;elf; allow him to plead his own cau&s;e,

and when I think I can &s;peak more to the purpo&s;e, depend on my interrupting him:" plucking her robe from my trembling fingers &s;he ran out of the room. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, irre&s;olute, and overcome with the arrival of a moment &s;o long wi&s;hed for, I made an effort to follow her, but u&s;ing the &s;ame means to detain me, I had un&s;ucce&s;sfully tried with my friend, Lord E&s;&s;ex gra&s;ped my robe more firmly. I turned, and not daring to fix my eyes on the graceful form, the fine face on which they fell, I dropt them, and yielded in &s;ilence to hear him. How deep, ah Hea|ven, how exqui&s;ite, is the remembrance of that moment, when the name of love fir&s;t reached my ear, from the only voice which could render it agreeable!&mdash;"I will not imagine, mo&s;t wor&s;hipped of wo|men, &s;aid the Earl, I offer you any new homage in thus bending before you. The moment my eyes fir&s;t beheld you, my too-ready knees offered up to you a heart, new to the pa&s;&s;ion that moment made eternal. The highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty to a father, who&s;e will in all other in&s;tances

De&s;|tined to re&s;ign in the flower of his days, every advantage which makes this world dear to man, he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought to &s;e|cure them all for a &s;on, who watered his pale cheek with the tears of guilele&s;s childhood; and to &s;ecure me friends at Court, who might &s;upply in &s;ome degree his own place, allied me nominally to the politic Wal&s;ingham; who&s;e intere&s;t alone could counter-balance that of our inveter|ate enemies, the Cecil family. The event ju&s;tified his opinion. A combination of cir|cum&s;tances would have buried me in ob|&s;curity, had I not had the &s;upport and attachment of Sir Francis. Thus circum|&s;tanced, it would ill become me to reject the daughter of the man to whom I owe my &s;afety and di&s;tinction; but early learning her character, and fearing to tru&s;t my happine&s;s in the hands of a girl who&s;e violent temper de&s;troyed her own, I yielded to the plea&s;ure of Lord Leice&s;|ter in remaining abroad: not without a
<PB N="181" REF="183">
hope (which time confirmed) that &s;he would in the interim give her heart to &s;ome more a&s;&s;iduous lover. I had rea&s;on to believe this wi&s;h was accompli&s;hed ere I ventured to return home. Her parti|ality for Sir Philip Sydney is indeed too apparent for me to think of uniting with her, were the friends of both willing to complete the match; but as I cannot help flattering my&s;elf the determination of Sir Philip will regulate that of the Wal&s;ing|ham family, fain would I learn from your indulgence (if indeed you deign to inter|e&s;t your&s;elf in the fate of a man, born but to adore you) whether Sydney has any thing to hope from your &s;i&s;ter. Accept in this explanation, my excu&s;e for pre|&s;uming to hover near your &s;ecret; and do not imagine by uniting my&s;elf in it, I &s;eek to intrude on engagements I &s;hall readily yield to, whether I am permitted to under&s;tand them or not."</P>
<P>Charmed alike with the accents of that harmonious voice, and the pa&s;&s;ion it ge|nerou&s;ly avowed&mdash;prepared by the open|ne&s;s of his recital to indulge my na|tural
<PB N="182" REF="184">
candor, I delivered my&s;elf wholly up to the impul&s;e of my heart; and the implied acknowledgment of my affection, made when I conde&s;cended to explain your &s;entiments re&s;pecting Sir Philip, lighted up his fine eyes with new &s;oftne&s;s and gratitude. In&s;en&s;ibly led on to &s;peak of Lord Leice&s;ter, I recollected at once the error I was committing; and not dar|ing to violate the &s;ilence I had promi&s;ed, I broke off abruptly, covered with blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion&mdash;a long pau&s;e en&s;ued&mdash;I rai&s;ed my eyes, anxious and irre&s;olute, to his&mdash;chagrin had dimmed all their lu&s;tre&mdash;he &s;aw the conflict in my mind, and recollecting the &s;uperiority of his own character, he conjured me "to con&s;ider well all I would &s;ay, and to believe that confidence would be only a weight upon his heart, which mine &s;hould ever re|proach me with be&s;towing." His wound|ed feelings gave a per&s;ua&s;ive tremulation to his voice; that, and the delicacy of mind which made him above profiting by the error of mine&mdash;the right a lover in|&s;tantly acquires over the conduct of a
<PB N="183" REF="185">
woman, who has once ventured to ac|knowledge her partiality&mdash;alas, above all perhaps, the exqui&s;ite fear &s;uch ever feel, at appearing for one moment to di&s;tru&s;t the object of their choice, all united to authori&s;e, in my own judgment, that full confe&s;&s;ion the occa&s;ion won from me. The a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tory of our birth, the &s;ecret of the Rece&s;s, its di&s;covery by Lord Leice&s;ter, your &s;ub&s;equent marriage with him, the feint by which the Queen was influenced alike to remain &s;ilent on every point re&s;pecting us, all was fully re|vealed&mdash;the veil of fiction fell at once, and pre&s;ented me to him the being I was born. This intere&s;ting confidence ce|mented our mutual pa&s;&s;ion, and gave &s;uch charms to the moment, as memory ever returns to with plea&s;ure. I impo&s;ed on him a vow of &s;ilence and &s;ecre&s;y, till your deci&s;ive refu&s;al of Sir Philip &s;hould fix his marriage with Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham; and more fortunate circum&s;tances facili|tate our own: nor could the interval ap|pear tedious to either, while we were daily permitted to meet, though in publick,
<PB N="184" REF="186">
and read in each other's eyes a pa&s;&s;ion untinctured with doubt, and which every following day promi&s;ed to &s;anctify. E&s;|&s;ex found too many &s;ources of wonder and plea&s;ure in the mutual confidence, to oppo&s;e her he from that moment looked up to, and we parted &s;o &s;atisfied with the interview, that either would have bought it with life.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I was far from con&s;ider|ing Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham as the &s;ole ob&s;tacle to our union. The politic Lord Leice&s;|ter, &s;trongly, though &s;ilently, oppo&s;ed it; nor indeed without rea&s;on. Con&s;cious he had reigned &s;o many years without a competitor in the heart of Elizabeth, he might ju&s;tly dread the progre&s;s of a rival, in whom all his advantages were united, with many he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Not &s;ati&s;|fied with the reputation of beauty and elegance, Leice&s;ter ever pa&s;&s;ionately de|&s;ired that of conduct and valor, and had given the kingdom but too convincing proofs how unequal he was to the military rank he held. E&s;&s;ex was born a &s;oldier. The rough and generous virtues of that
<PB N="185" REF="187">
character, were joined in him with the po|li&s;hed graces of a courtier, and the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te for literature. A man cal|culated to &s;hine in whatever light you examined him, could not fail to alarm all who valued and held the favor of Eliza|beth. Add to this, that the Earl was na|turally bold and a&s;piring; con&s;equently would retain whatever he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Such were already the fears of all the fa|vorites of the Queen, and who could bound mine, when I recollected the du|bious fate of his noble father, and the la&s;t warning he had given to this darling &s;on?</P>
<P>The &s;udden and unexpected marriage of Sir Philip Sydney and Mi&s;s Wal&s;ing|ham, revived tho&s;e hopes in the mind of E&s;&s;ex, I had &s;o long &s;trove to throw at a di&s;tance; and with them too revived the vain project of confiding his views to Lord Leice&s;ter, with who&s;e approbation of them he &s;till continued to flatter him|&s;elf. Terrified le&s;t &s;uch an unguarded mea&s;ure &s;hould exa&s;perate Leice&s;ter to his utter ruin, who would ill-brook

this embryo rival that &s;hould cro&s;s his fate in <HI>every</HI> in&s;tance, and dare to contend with him for a &s;hare of tho&s;e advantages he was determined to monopolize, I ex|erted the utmo&s;t care to charm my lover to &s;ilence. Alas, every day made that more difficult. The Queen and Leice&s;|ter, fearful of my finding among the many who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves my &s;er|vants, one who&s;e views would interfere with theirs, immediately allotted me that weak wretch, Lord Arlington, for a hu&s;|band; and in countenancing his addre&s;&s;es, threw every other lover at a di&s;tance: at the &s;ame time giving me but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, if ever I was per|mitted to marry, it mu&s;t be as a &s;acrifice to both. Not daring to con&s;ult you on a &s;ubject I had &s;o long concealed, and on which we mu&s;t ever think &s;o differ|ently, and unwilling to blight the little gleam of &s;un&s;hine love illumined your days with, I re&s;igned my&s;elf up to a gloom which hardly the pre&s;ence of E&s;&s;ex could di&s;&s;ipate.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
A very &s;hort time rendered the inten|tions of the Queen and Lord Leice&s;ter obvious to E&s;&s;ex. His impa&s;&s;ioned &s;oul, fired alike with love of me, and di&s;dain of him I was commanded to love, treated Lord Arlington with &s;o marked a con|tempt, that nothing but the irre&s;olution incident to weak minds, could prevent Arlington from making a mortal quarrel of it. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in my confidence of the means to render Lord Leice&s;ter more tractable, the Earl of E&s;&s;ex &s;olicited my con&s;ent to in&s;i&s;t on that of your Lord, as well as his intere&s;t with the Queen, if he valued the pre&s;ervation of his own &s;e|cret.</P>
<P>The tender love which attached me to you, alone could induce me to oppo&s;e a de&s;ign of which my happine&s;s was the ul|timate object. But convinced an eclair-ci&s;&s;ement of this kind would embroil me forever with Lord Leice&s;ter, and fill your &s;uffering mind with a trouble beyond all tho&s;e you had already experienced, I con&s;ented to &s;ee Lord E&s;&s;ex once more at Lady Pembroke's; and exerting at that

interview every power I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over his perturbed heart, to moderate his rage, and &s;oothe his love, till the en&s;uing cam|paign in the Netherlands &s;hould be over, I promi&s;ed a &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance to every matrimonial propo&s;al in the interval, and to decide his fate on his return. Know|ing it vain to hope to actuate him by any &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration of his own welfare, I buried in my own heart its deepe&s;t &s;ources of apprehen&s;ion, and bound him to patience by a &s;trong repre&s;entation of the dangers to which any ra&s;hne&s;s on his part would infallibly expo&s;e me. Tho&s;e inflamed pa&s;&s;ions no other being could ever control, were regulated by my voice; and when nece&s;&s;ity compelled us to part, I &s;eemed to leave in his arms the dearer portion of my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Occupied by feelings and views di&s;tinct from each other, and agreeing only in watching the wind, and &s;ending every wi&s;h towards the camp, you and I &s;eldom entered into our accu&s;tomed confidence and friend&s;hip. I had, however, &s;ome|times the relief of a letter, through the
<PB N="189" REF="191">
medium of Lady Pembroke; by tho&s;e I learnt your Lord &s;till maintained an out|ward &s;hew of civility towards E&s;&s;ex, while he &s;ecretly made him &s;en&s;ible of all his power; yet with an art &s;o profound, as left him no apparent right to complain. He often reminded me of my promi&s;e, and vowed to pre&s;erve an undoubted claim to it, by &s;till enduring for my &s;ake. Over|whelmed with anxiety and perplexities, I hardly dur&s;t look towards the unravelling of events &s;o complicated, and waited in dread|ful &s;u&s;pen&s;e the will of Heaven. It broke in thunder over me&mdash;the cruel &s;itu|ation in which you &s;oon found your&s;elf, Lord Leice&s;ter's abrupt and imprudent return on the news of it&mdash;the politick con&s;truction he gave that return to the &s;ick and doting Queen&mdash;her &s;udden re|&s;olution to marry him, and the immedi|ate nece&s;&s;ity for getting out of her power, which rendered both him and you in one hour mi&s;erable fugitives, were incidents &s;o &s;trange, rapid, and un&s;u&s;pected, that I became their victim, ere I could any way account for it.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
The fatal morning of Lord Leice&s;ter's return, you left him to attend the ri&s;ing of the Queen, which was on that day your periodical duty. I waited with im|patience the event of my Lord's vi&s;it to Elizabeth, in which my own &s;afety, as well as yours, was immediately concerned. A &s;ervant of Lady Pembroke's, in whom &s;he repo&s;ed great tru&s;t, &s;uddenly brought me word that a fright had thrown her into premature labor, and the danger was &s;o imminent, that even while we &s;poke &s;he might breathe her la&s;t; neverthele&s;s the me&s;&s;enger, in her name, urged me to ha&s;ten to her, if I valued the letters I had lodged in her hands. I gave way to the alarm without reflection, and accom|panied the me&s;&s;enger in&s;tantly; nor did I meet in pa&s;&s;ing through the palace any of our women, or friends, to whom I could mention the cau&s;e of my &s;udden ab&s;ence. Happily the danger of my much-loved friend was over ere I arrived. I pre&s;t her hand in &s;ilence, and took from it the packet relative to E&s;&s;ex, &s;he had kept ready to give me; which I put into my bo|&s;om,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
and was ha&s;tening back, when a &s;tranger, as I pa&s;&s;ed thro' the outer court, pre&s;ented me a note. The hand, my flut|tered &s;en&s;es owned for that of E&s;&s;ex. But why &s;hould he return to England? A confu&s;ed fear aro&s;e in my mind, which hardly left me power to read it. It was anonymous, but I learnt from it, "he had been at the hou&s;e of Lady Pembroke, where, &s;hocked at the di&s;tre&s;s into which her misfortune had ju&s;t thrown her Lord, as well as the whole family, he found it vain to hope their a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards ob|taining an interview with me, which, ne|verthele&s;s, was highly e&s;&s;ential to the peace and &s;afety of both. He ended with conjuring me to follow the bearer, if I wi&s;hed to &s;ave him from de&s;peration."&mdash;Perhaps on the deci&s;ion of this important moment depended the peace of my whole future life. Too &s;urely my compliance infinitely lengthened the fatal ab&s;ence from Court which enthralled me for many pain|ful years; and dearly did I expiate that fir&s;t deviation from propriety and prudence. But are we always rulers over our feel|ings?

<P>I &s;tept into a hired boat the me&s;&s;enger &s;hewed me, which was rowed down the river with the utmo&s;t rapidity. During the little voyage, I revolved in my mind every probable rea&s;on for this &s;udden and alarming return of the Earl; but I was at Greenwich, ere I yet had fixed on one. I landed at a &s;olitary garden belonging to Lord Southampton, and was conducted to a pavillion which overhung the water, where I found E&s;&s;ex alone: pale, di&s;or|dered, and undre&s;t, with every &s;ymptom of anxiety and fatigue. Overwhelmed with I know not what agitation, I &s;unk upon his &s;houlder, as he knelt before me, and gave way to an uncertain pre&s;entiment of &s;adne&s;s, a few hours after &s;o fully veri|fied. Not even the charm of his voice could immediately &s;oothe &s;pirits &s;o many alarming circum&s;tances had deeply agi|tated: neverthele&s;s, on comprehending &s;urmi&s;e, and not misfortune, had brought
<PB N="193" REF="195">
him thus &s;uddenly to England, I felt my oppre&s;&s;ed heart breathe a little more freely. I by-and-by under&s;tood that the &s;ole mo|tive of this journey was the &s;udden one of Lord Leice&s;ter; that by means of friends who &s;urrounded your Lord, he had always endeavored to keep a watch|ful eye on his actions; and found a packet of letters, brought by a tru&s;ty hand from England, had agitated him &s;o &s;trongly, as to make him re&s;olve on leav|ing his command, and returning imme|diately. The communication of this my&s;terious re&s;olution determined him to follow the &s;teps of his General, which he was enabled to do, as he fortunately acted only as a Volunteer. The impatience Lord Leice&s;ter di&s;covered by his ha&s;ty journey, authori&s;ed the fears of the rival who followed his &s;teps; and per&s;uaded him either that the &s;ecret of my birth had tran&s;pired, or that &s;ome manoeu|vre was projected, to di&s;po&s;e of me as policy dictated. Rendered de&s;perate by the&s;e fears, he had left every thing in train for an immediate return, if fortu|nately

I was &s;till at liberty; or if he could be the happy means of delivering me, in ca&s;e the whole truth had been di&s;covered; nor could he longer doubt but I would at la&s;t con&s;ent to follow the fortunes of a man, who had never for a moment put all the hopes he might perhaps ju&s;tly form, in competition with the &s;ingle one of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing me. The generous error of his conduct could not offend me, but per&s;uaded my own &s;ituation was not &s;o de&s;perate as he repre&s;ented it, I account|ed to him for Lord Leice&s;ter's precipitate journey, by acknowledging the truth; and urged him to leave England directly, that even his having vi&s;ited it might ne|ver tran&s;pire. But I talked to one who no longer attended to me. His eyes wandered wildly over my features, while his whole &s;oul was engro&s;&s;ed by his favo|rite project. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and di&s;tracted with the idea, that Lord Leice&s;ter would in|fallibly ruin his hopes, by di&s;po&s;ing of me if ever I was again in his power, not all my vows of everla&s;ting love and fide|lity to him, nor promi&s;es of the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate

"You are gone, you are lo&s;t to me for ever, if once the&s;e eyes lo&s;e &s;ight of you," was his impa&s;&s;ioned reply, a thou&s;and times repeated to all my arguments and intreaties.&mdash;"It is the cri&s;is of our fate, my love, would he cry,&mdash;yield, oh yield to it! Admitting <HI>you</HI> are proof again&s;t trials you cannot gue&s;s at till too late, how know you but I may be &s;acrificed? Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham al|ready repents con&s;enting to annul the contract between me and his daughter; &s;he is already widowed; a hint would en|gage Lord Leice&s;ter to favor its renewal (for do not his views coincide with that project?) a word from him would deter|mine the Queen in its favor; and a com|mand from her, di&s;obeyed, would exile me for life. Thus, my &s;weet Ellen, con|tinued this agitated lover, you not only put your own fate in the hands of a man, who will never con&s;ent to unite it with mine, but even &s;hould you have re&s;oluti|on to re&s;i&s;t his will, you deliver up to it a wretch you &s;ay you dearly love, and who

certainly loves you to madne&s;s." Bathing the hands he gra&s;ped, with precious drops of tenderne&s;s and angui&s;h, he held them alter|nately to his lips and heart.&mdash;What was the di&s;traction of my &s;oul at that mo|ment?&mdash;Inexorably to refu&s;e was the hard duty impo&s;ed by my rea&s;on, while my &s;oul even melted with fondne&s;s. But the fear that I &s;hould entail misfortune on the dear choice of my heart; ob&s;cure at once the brilliant fortune which &s;eemed to &s;pread before his youthful &s;teps, and track them perhaps with blood; a ju&s;t remem|brance of the &s;evere cen&s;ure I had pa&s;&s;ed on your conduct, under circum&s;tances not le&s;s trying, and a conviction that &s;uch a compliance would infallibly endanger your &s;afety, made me re&s;olve to act up to my &s;en&s;e of rectitude, at whatever price. I collected the&s;e rea&s;ons, and many more, which have now e&s;caped my mind, to prepare E&s;&s;ex for a di&s;appointment, I was &s;ure he would feel but too &s;en&s;ibly; and &s;trove to reconcile him to the refu&s;al, by convincing him his own welfare was the chief cau&s;e of it. Perhaps, in truth, it
<PB N="197" REF="199">
was; for hardly can the &s;un tinge the dew-drops with more various hues, than the &s;oul will ca&s;t upon its feelings. I a thou|&s;and times a&s;&s;ured him, "that to be the &s;ole object of his heart, did not give me more plea&s;ure, than to &s;ee him the admi|ration of the kingdom. The happy pro|mi&s;e of his youth, I added, had centered every eye, and every hope in him. What then would be my grief and di&s;appoint|ment, if the coming years which ought to crown him with glory, were to bury him in ob&s;curity, or &s;teep him in &s;orrow&mdash;that nature had formed me with a &s;trength of mind to view every &s;ituation in its true light; nor could I comprize all human pa&s;&s;ions in love, though I thought it, perhaps, the leading one. Fill up the interval of our &s;eparation, my Lord, cried I, with a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch heroic actions, as may give to our union, whenever Heaven permits it, the only happine&s;s not comprized in it&s;elf&mdash;the &s;acred &s;en&s;e of having de&s;erved it. Nor &s;hall the gentler virtues of my &s;ex be wanting; time, patience, and fortitude,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
often conquer fate her&s;elf; nor will I ever yield to Lord Leice&s;ter, an obedience I do not owe him, though for my &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake I &s;hall conde&s;cend to temporize, in in&s;tances of le&s;s importance. Plighted to you by every tye, the rites of the church could only ratify a claim, which will from this moment make my accep|tance of another, an adultery of the wor&s;t kind. Ha&s;ten back then, my dear E&s;&s;ex; conceal, if po&s;&s;ible, that you have been ab&s;ent, and beware how you expo&s;e to the eyes of Lord Leice&s;ter a &s;u&s;picion of his honor, he would never, perhaps, par|don." I broke from his arms, &s;trength|ened, &s;urely, by &s;ome &s;upernatural aid.&mdash;"Yet &s;tay, my beloved, my wor&s;hip|ped Ellinor&mdash;Oh yet be per&s;uaded&mdash;you leave me for ever&mdash;the&s;e aching eyes &s;ee you for the la&s;t time&mdash;never, oh never, &s;hall I now call you mine."&mdash;Such were the pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations which vibrat|ed on my quickened &s;en&s;e, as I flew towards the boat, and ordered the men to row to London. My full eyes &s;till &s;ought that graceful form, which with folded arms,

and a dejected air, hung over the terrace; and my heart di&s;&s;olved at the accents which &s;till lingered on my ear. Alas, I knew not then how far they were prophe|tic!</P>
<P>Such was my conflict, &s;uch my deter|mination, during the bu&s;y hours fraught with your fate, and mine, my &s;i&s;ter. The mind, however, &s;oon recovers all its vigor, when it has dared to act up to its duties, and I had wept away my ten|der chagrin ere I reached the Court. Ah, let me &s;horten this part of my recital, le&s;t I ra&s;hly pau&s;e to que&s;tion Heaven, why the mo&s;t meritorious moment of my life became the cau&s;e of my ruin? I reached London, Matilda, two hours after you and Lord Leice&s;ter quitted it; and fearful of the appearance my long ab&s;ence might have even in your eyes, did you know how the time had been &s;pent, I re|&s;olved to tell you I had pa&s;&s;ed the day at Lady Pembroke's bed&s;ide; and to avoid the enquiry of indifferent per&s;ons, &s;tole at the clo&s;e of the evening through the back courts: thus fatally eluding every watch|ful

care of Lady Arundell, who had planted a&s;&s;iduous friends in every other avenue to the palace, ready to intercept me when returning, after &s;he had cau&s;ed London to be explored in vain to find me.</P>
<P>Ah, gracious Heaven, what were my emotions when entering our apartment, I &s;aw the Queen's women and officers in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it! The di&s;order of our ca|binets and che&s;ts; every thing indicated a dangerous di&s;covery&mdash;a terror, for which there is no name, came over me. A joy|ful exclamation on the part of tho&s;e into who&s;e hands I had fallen; and a di&s;patch to the Queen, gave me rea&s;on to fear alike for my Matilda. To the enquiries I made, no other an&s;wer was given, than that they were employed to guard, and not inform me; and an officer of the Queen's immediately appeared to conduct me to her pre&s;ence. Unable to com|mand a &s;ingle moment of &s;olitude and &s;ilence to regulate my thoughts or ac|tions, the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the fu|ture, pre&s;ented only one wild chaos to
<PB N="201" REF="203">
my mind, which hardly the breath of Heaven &s;eemed able to bring into order. Pale, horror-&s;truck, and &s;peechle&s;s, I was dragged like a criminal into the clo|&s;et of the Queen; who&s;e burning cheeks, and enraged eyes, told me in one killing look all I had to dread. My conductors were ordered to retire, and Lord Bur|leigh, with the old Lady Latimer, were the only &s;pectators of this dreadful inter|view. Scarce could my trembling limbs &s;upport me, or my &s;unk &s;oul utter a &s;in|gle word. Death&mdash;death in the mo&s;t terrible form glared upon me&mdash;What do I &s;ay, death? Oh, that I had feared no other evil!&mdash;Grief, in&s;ult, obloquy, all that can add horrors to the grave, pro|mi&s;ed to forerun it. The remembrance of the packet of letters, the te&s;timonials of my birth, whatever was wanting to confirm the doubts of Elizabeth, or re|double her rage, were all to be found about me. Matilda, E&s;&s;ex&mdash;tho&s;e forms &s;o dear, gli&s;tered before my tearful eyes; and I &s;eemed in this peril|ous
<PB N="202" REF="204">
moment to drag down to the earth every human being I loved and valued.</P>
<P>Elizabeth gave way to that coar&s;e vio|lence which marks her manners. Is there a vindictive or opprobrious epithet &s;he did not exhau&s;t? Lord Burleigh, apprehend|ing this ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion, would rather <HI>give</HI> than <HI>gain</HI> information, &s;olicited her permi&s;&s;ion to examine me, which &s;he &s;ul|lenly granted. To all his artful and in&s;idi|ous enquiries I replied with truth, veiling only &s;uch particulars of your life and my own, as malice might con&s;true into a crime; always referring my&s;elf to Lord Leice&s;ter, in who&s;e bo&s;om the &s;ecret of our fate was, as the Queen well knew, depo&s;ited. "Ah, ha! then, traitre&s;s, cried Elizabeth, no longer able to contain her rage, her very eyes fla&s;hing fire, &s;o thou woulde&s;t artfully feign ignorance of thy dete&s;ted &s;i&s;ter's marriage with that vil|lain thou glo&s;&s;e&s;t over &s;o rarely; that in|formation, I thank him, he has thought proper to give me under his own hand, (pointing to a paper lying on the table near her) take that truth from me, and
<PB N="203" REF="205">
now unfold the re&s;t, or tortures &s;hall wring it from thee."</P>
<P>She continued to &s;peak, but I had cea&s;ed to hear&mdash;breathle&s;s, mute, a&s;|tounded, my feet &s;eemed to take root on the &s;pot where I &s;tood, and my tears alone proved I was not marble.&mdash;Lord Leice&s;|ter's marriage acknowledged&mdash;authenti|cated at &s;uch a juncture&mdash;and by him&s;elf too&mdash;Heavens, what a chaos did this news make in my mind!&mdash;"Speak, Jeze|bel! (exclaimed the exa&s;perated Queen, in a tone almo&s;t as inarticulate through pa&s;&s;ion as mine was through fear) thou art &s;till in my power&mdash;though the perfi|dious villain I had rai&s;ed from the du&s;t, and loaded with benefits, though he, I &s;ay, and his minion have e&s;caped my vengeance, thou art yet within my reach&mdash;tremble le&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t an&s;wer, &s;hould &s;uffer for all."</P>
<P>Alas, her utmo&s;t rage could hardly have added a pang to tho&s;e which at that moment overwhelmed me. Another kil|ling truth had unwarily e&s;caped her&mdash;Lord Leice&s;ter him&s;elf then thought there
<PB N="204" REF="206">
was no &s;afety but in flight&mdash;he was gone, and my &s;i&s;ter, it was plain, had accom|panied him&mdash;both had &s;urrendered me up a hopele&s;s, helple&s;s victim, however unoffending&mdash;even tears, as well as lan|guage, now failed me, and my brain &s;hot through with fire. Oh, E&s;&s;ex, in this mo|ment I yet remembered thee. Thy la&s;t words yet rung in my ears, and my &s;oul &s;truggled with the deep regret I felt for having &s;corned thy project, through a vain, vain genero&s;ity. Elizabeth finding threats and interrogations alike lo&s;t on a girl who&s;e ab&s;ent &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to have wholly retired into her heart, now gave way to one of her violent tran&s;ports; &s;he threw a large book of devotion, which lay by her on the table, with &s;o good an aim, that it &s;truck me on the temple, and I &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the earth. The atten|dants were all called in, and my laces cut, as having fainted, the Queen not chu&s;ing to avow a re&s;entment &s;o gro&s;sly expre&s;&s;ed. A ribbon, from whence hung the dearer part of my exi&s;tence, tho&s;e te&s;timonials of my birth, which were
<PB N="205" REF="207">
one day to fix my rank in life, attracted the eye of Elizabeth. The ready atten|dants di&s;engaged and pre&s;ented them to her hand, together with the packet con|taining my corre&s;pondence with E&s;&s;ex. I was in&s;en&s;ibly reviving when &s;he pe|ru&s;ed the fir&s;t, but &s;urely that moment half avenged me.&mdash;Never did mind or body undergo a greater revolution&mdash;rage evaporated at once&mdash;&s;urprize, grief, con|fu&s;ion, &s;ilence &s;ucceeded; with a face pale as my own, trembling hands; and failing eyes, over and over again did &s;he exa|mine the inconte&s;table proofs of &s;o &s;ur|prizing an event: then wildly glancing towards my features, tore the papers into atoms, &s;he never thought &s;mall enough.</P>
<P>During this interval, I had &s;o far re|covered my&s;elf as to be capable of &s;peak|ing; but &s;carce had I uttered a &s;ound, ere &s;he &s;tarted, in her turn afraid to hear, "take her away on your lives, cried &s;he, in a broken and inward voice; con|vey her into my little clo&s;et, nor let one &s;oul &s;ee or &s;peak to her, as you value my favor." The &s;ervile &s;laves of her will
<PB N="206" REF="208">
executed this order with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tmo&s;t ala|crity; and the room was guarded by two officers, who took from me every means of e&s;cape or death. Alas! I thought not of either. Yielding to the de&s;olating flood which had in one hour encompa&s;&s;ed me, I braved the future.&mdash;Betrayed, de|livered up by Lord Leice&s;ter,&mdash;neglect|ed, forgotten by my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;the pair for whom alone I &s;eemed hitherto to have lived; had fate another blow in &s;tore? Yet even if &s;o, it mu&s;t &s;port with human mi&s;ery to level it at me, when tho&s;e already given were mortal. A &s;tern and &s;ullen de&s;pair &s;ucceeded the keen vici&s;&s;itude of emoti|ons which had marked the la&s;t hour of my life; I con&s;idered my&s;elf as the de|voted of Heaven and man, and re&s;olved to oppo&s;e a heart rendered callous by in|jury, to every future &s;troke of fortune.</P>
<P>Elizabeth forgot not her u&s;ual policy even while overwhelmed with &s;urprize; the room in which &s;he had ordered me to be confined, had another door, which led to private pa&s;&s;ages through the palace, and from this entrance a guard approached
<PB N="207" REF="209">
at midnight, and informed me it was the plea&s;ure of the Queen that I &s;hould fol|low them. I obeyed in &s;ilence, and get|ting into a litter I found at the garden gate, enquired not even my de&s;tination. I travelled almo&s;t without re&s;ting for two days and a night; care having been taken to provide relays, which were every where ready. During the fir&s;t day's journey a guard attended, but all pro&s;pect of my being relea&s;ed by human a&s;&s;i&s;tance then cea&s;ing, I found my&s;elf delivered into the charge of Lord Burleigh and his &s;ervants. My deep perturbations began now to &s;ub&s;ide, and my &s;oul inclined to its wont|ed habits: though to have been betrayed by Lord Leice&s;ter and my &s;i&s;ter, was a recollection my wounded feelings had not yet courage enough to cope with. Alas, how &s;hould they? When the pa&s;&s;ions are permitted to decide our conduct, how|ever heroic it proves, we claim not tho&s;e returns rea&s;on tells us are due to every in&s;tance of virtue, which had no other in|centive than rea&s;on. Ah, E&s;&s;ex! dear prophetic E&s;&s;ex! &s;ighed my heart at &s;ome
<PB N="208" REF="210">
moments, why, why, did I inexorably reject thy generous propo&s;al? that un|grateful &s;i&s;ter to who&s;e &s;afety I &s;acrificed the &s;weete&s;t hopes of my life, manacles thy devoted love; and flies far away to take &s;helter in that country I dared not &s;eek even under thy protection.</P>
<P>At the turn of the night, a dreadful &s;torm of thunder, lightning, wind and rain, broke over us; and the terrors na|tural to my &s;ex on &s;uch occa&s;ions, were doubled on finding the whole party were &s;et on by a banditti. A moment before, and I &s;hould have affirmed I had nothing to dread, yet &s;o lively was my new fear, that even the vengeance of Elizabeth became nothing in the compari&s;on. The &s;er|vants of Lord Burleigh made a de&s;perate but vain re&s;i&s;tance; and the whole were at length led away by the ruffians into a wood adjoining: where all, no doubt, like me, expected to be murdered. The &s;torm now began to abate, and the moon &s;ometimes forced its way through the vo|lumes of black clouds which yet hung over it. My quickened &s;en&s;es caught
<PB N="209" REF="211">
its gleams to examine if any habitation, or other hope of re&s;cue was in view. In vain I &s;trained my &s;ight. The wood in|volved us entirely, and every feeble hope died away, when my eyes &s;uddenly re&s;ted on&mdash;ah, gracious Heaven!&mdash;our own Rece&s;s.&mdash;Yes, the well-known entrance of the tomb pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and a thou&s;and vague ideas of &s;afety and danger ming|ling in my mind, as the robbers approach|ed the litter to take me out, I &s;creamed, and &s;wooned away.</P>
<P>Alas, my &s;i&s;ter, call to mind your own feelings, and gue&s;s at mine when I once more opened my eyes in the great room of our Rece&s;s&mdash;that room once hallowed with the prayers of father Anthony, and the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Marlow&mdash;that room where once the portraits of our parents &s;miled peace and &s;ecurity on their now de&s;olate offspring&mdash;how hideous was the change!&mdash;its bare walls, grimed with a thou&s;and uncouth and frightful images, pre&s;ented only a faint picture of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, on who&s;e hardened faces I dared not fix my fearful eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">
Con&s;idering me but as accidental plun|der, they were wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the old Lord Burleigh; in whom &s;ome im|portant view &s;eemed to centre, I &s;hrunk from the terrible &s;cene, and called upon the awful &s;hades of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to me, to appal, in turn, the de&s;perate wretches who made the time-&s;truck walls re&s;ound with threats and execrations. My &s;hock|ed eyes &s;ought the ground as a relief, and fixed upon a well-known object&mdash;It was that ring of Mrs. Marlow's, with which father Anthony wedded you to Lord Leice&s;ter, and well I remembered that ring was on your hand when la&s;t we parted. I &s;tooped impatiently for it&mdash;my &s;en&s;es more fully recogni&s;ed its &s;et|ting.&mdash;The dreadful truth fla&s;hed upon my mind. "Alas! my &s;i&s;ter and Lord Leice&s;ter are alike en&s;nared, groaned I forth without any con&s;ideration&mdash;well I know they mu&s;t be here&mdash;Oh, in what dungeon have you hid them?" "Your &s;i&s;ter, fair Lady, returned one of the vil|lains, with an odious grin; comrades, our Captain will thank us for this prize,
<PB N="211" REF="213">
this mu&s;t be &s;he he talked &s;o much about when the other travellers threw them&s;elves into our hands.&mdash;Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, mi&s;tre&s;s, your &s;i&s;ter is locked up as &s;afe as cords can keep her."</P>
<P>All the angui&s;h I had before felt be|came nothing at this moment. "My &s;i&s;ter in this dungeon? cried I; oh, born to &s;uffer with me, dear Matilda! how will that &s;oft frame, always unequal to the trials of life, and now entirely debilitated, &s;upport the&s;e horrors! Alas, Sirs, if there is yet in your hearts one touch of human pity, conduct me to this tender &s;ufferer, and let her die in my arms." "All in good time, young woman," replied another, with an air &s;o &s;urly, as awed even my convul&s;ed &s;oul to &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Lord Burleigh &s;till was their great ob|ject; threats, and oaths were exhau&s;ted on him: when, to con&s;ummate the terrors of that moment, the name of Williams reached me. That name expounding both the pa&s;t and future, wrought my fears up to frenzy. I ca&s;t my wild eyes around in &s;earch of any means to die,
<PB N="212" REF="214">
and could in that terrible moment, like Portia, have &s;wallowed fire; when a tu|mult without the room, at once &s;u&s;pended that within it. The &s;ound of pi&s;tols, the precipitate entrance of &s;uch of the rob|bers as were not already round us, fol|lowed by many unknown per&s;ons, in|&s;tantly convinced me Heaven had deliver|ed us from our oppre&s;&s;ors, by &s;ome means le&s;s &s;hocking to humanity, than tho&s;e de&s;|pair had filled my thoughts with. A dreadful conte&s;t en&s;ued, but our deliver|ers prevailing, immediately began to un|bind Lord Burleigh; who, almo&s;t mute with exce&s;&s;ive &s;urprize, found in them a train of his own dome&s;tics from the ad|joining Abbey of St. Vincent, which I under&s;tood was now one of his &s;eats. Nor was their amazement le&s;s at meeting with their Lord in this newly-di&s;covered den. I comprehended the whole in a mo|ment; and plainly perceived the &s;ervants of Lord Burleigh mu&s;t have come through the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, that commu|nicated with the Abbey; I recollected that it was unknown to Williams, nor doubted
<PB N="213" REF="215">
but you and Lord Leice&s;ter had e&s;caped through it. Overwhelmed with the ble&s;&s;ed events comprized in this deliverance, I for|got I had any thing &s;till to fear; and no con&s;idering Lord Burleigh as my keeper, I &s;aw in him only a fellow-&s;ufferer. I ro&s;e with alacrity, and led the way to the dungeon which communicated with the Abbey; tho&s;e who newly came from thence following me in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment. I perceived the cords with which you and my Lord had been bound, and demanded you of the &s;ervants with a joyful impati|ence. Lord Burleigh learnt from my in|coherent tran&s;ports, a truth I had refu&s;ed before to inform him of: that chance had impri&s;oned us in the very &s;pot where you and I were bred. Wholly taken up with my own exclamations, and regard|le&s;s of the &s;ilence of my followers, I hailed the entrance of the Abbey, &s;o long our happy a&s;ylum. Ah, Heavens, how cruelly were the&s;e lively emotions repelled and extingui&s;hed, when by the command of Lord Burleigh, his &s;ervants once more &s;eized me as a pri&s;oner, and attempted
<PB N="214" REF="216">
to lead me towards a remote apartment. With a heart humbled and broken by &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive frights and afflictions, I &s;unk at his feet, not di&s;daining the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive attitude, and only &s;olicited to &s;ee you. I reminded him of the dangers he and I had &s;hared together, and con|jured him to remember you alone could have opened the pa&s;&s;age which led us all to freedom,&mdash;unle&s;s he ba&s;ely re&s;olved to become to me a murderer, as dreadful as tho&s;e from whom we had ju&s;t e&s;caped. Inexorably cold, he replied, "my un|guarded acknowledgments only gave him &s;tronger rea&s;on to imagine much was yet concealed; and that whenever I would re|&s;olve to be wholly &s;incere, I &s;hould not want his intere&s;t with his royal mi&s;tre&s;s." Breaking from tho&s;e trembling hands, which every moment more infeebled, he ordered his &s;ervants to bear me into the grated room at the end of the ea&s;tern cloi&s;ter. You cannot but remember the di&s;mal place. Half &s;unk in ruin, and overhung with ivy, and trees of growth almo&s;t immemorial, it appeared the very

cell of melancholy. Alas, her pale repre|&s;entative took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in my&s;elf. The ma&s;&s;y bars no &s;ooner gave a&s;&s;urance that I was &s;ecure, than my conductors impatiently flew to rejoin the re&s;t, and learn the news of the family. To me that &s;mall relief was barbarou&s;ly denied. So near the cau&s;e and partaker of my &s;orrows, they were de&s;tined to flow in &s;olitude; nor could imagination decide whether you were yet a pri&s;oner, or had again e&s;caped. How terrible are the vague &s;u&s;picions of an impa&s;&s;ioned mind, when deprived of every means of certitude!

po&s;&s;ibility, the dawning day re|alized no other objects, than tho&s;e drea|ry ones my chamber pre&s;ented. The bats and owls began to retire to their haunts in my neighbourhood, and the &s;hort vi&s;it of the ri&s;ing &s;un, only &s;hewed me the limits of a dark and di&s;mal pri|&s;on. By this time both mind and body were alike exhau&s;ted, and a mi&s;t appeared to envelop my &s;en&s;es, which &s;till recall a thou&s;and fleeting forms, by turns &s;urround|ing me, till fatigue threw me into a deep &s;leep.</P>
<P>It was at length interrupted by a maid who brought me breakfa&s;t, and a me&s;&s;age from her Lord, "that if I would inform him what was wanting to my comfort and accommodation, his orders &s;hould immediately &s;upply it." I ca&s;t my eyes expre&s;&s;ively around, and bid her tell him in one word, "every thing." The wo|man &s;eemed affected; I &s;natched the for|tunate moment, and putting my pur&s;e into her hand, a&s;ked in return only to know the fate of Lord Leice&s;ter and my &s;i&s;ter.

both had, by &s;ome incomprehen&s;ible means again e&s;caped, and that Lord Bur|leigh's generous daughter was confined as their abettor. A ha&s;ty &s;ummons to the maid left me once more alone; but the news &s;he had communicated, and the idea that the amiable Ro&s;e might hereafter be alike ready to relieve my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, gave a new turn to my &s;pirits, which now gather|ed courage to retrace the pa&s;t, and look into the future.</P>
<P>Although unable to comprehend what the urgent motives could be which impel|led Lord Leice&s;ter and my &s;i&s;ter to &s;o pre|cipitate a flight, every thing argued that they were de&s;perate: for that it was &s;ud|den and without preparation, their inten|tion of taking &s;helter in the Rece&s;s &s;trong|ly indicated; and whenever I recollected the dangerous &s;ituation of Matilda, I &s;hared with her that compa&s;&s;ion &s;elf is but too apt to engro&s;s. Was there a &s;pot of St. Vincent's Abbey, however gloomy, which did not call to my mind &s;ome in|&s;tance of that integrity, affection, and nobility of heart, which di&s;tingui&s;hed my

<P>When time and &s;olitude re&s;tored me rea&s;on enough coolly to con&s;ider my own &s;tate, I &s;aw no immediate danger it could teem with.

Malice it&s;elf could affix on me no other crime than that of being daughter to the Queen of Scots; a fatal truth which Elizabeth would gladly forget, but &s;urely never publi&s;h. Could I re&s;olve, therefore, to endure with pa|tience the puni&s;hment &s;o unworthily im|po&s;ed on me, I might in time emerge un&s;ullied to di&s;tinction.

<P>The decency with which I was attend|ed and &s;erved, convinced me both Eliza|beth and her Mini&s;ter had &s;till terms to keep with me; but the &s;ervant who had ventured to an&s;wer me was impeached by tho&s;e who waited without the door, and my pur&s;e being found upon her, no doubt became a &s;ufficient proof of guilt. Certainly I &s;aw her no more, and the wo|men deputed in her place, were either too guarded, or too ignorant, to inform me on any &s;ubject, had I left my&s;elf mo|ney to try their fidelity.</P>
<P>I had once been &s;o accu&s;tomed to &s;eclu|&s;ion, that it would &s;oon have lo&s;t its hor|rors, had my misfortunes re&s;ted here; but re&s;olved, however, not to augment them by vain and fruitle&s;s repining, I de|manded &s;uch books as might &s;trengthen and amu&s;e my mind: thus oppo&s;ing the wi&s;dom of ages, to the pangs of the mo|ment.

<P>This lethargic tranquillity was &s;oon in|terrupted by a vi&s;it from Lord Burleigh. With the fair language of an experienced courtier, he "commended my re&s;ignation to an inevitable fate, and admired the wi&s;e u&s;e I made of confinement, in thus applying my&s;elf to enrich my under&s;tand|ing; a&s;&s;uring me he went beyond his or|ders for my accommodation, but that an expre&s;s which arrived over-night from the Queen, had at la&s;t put it in his power to re&s;tore that liberty, he had by her com|mand deprived me of," My heart leaped at &s;o unhoped an alteration in my fate, but he intercepted the tran&s;port ere it reached my lips, and &s;ent it back a dead weight into my bo&s;om.

Alas! while they were adorning me with the co&s;tly habiliments &s;elected on the occa&s;ion, I took a mali|cious plea&s;ure in tracing the ravages grief had already made in my features, con&s;ti|tution, and figure; the fir&s;t, &s;hrunk, wan, and withered, the latter emaciated beyond all concealment.

They told me, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be led to the chair of the Queen, who no &s;ooner in the common form pre&s;ented me her hand, than I haughtily repelled it, and fixing my eyes on her with a dreadful meaning, gave a deep groan, and &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s at her feet. Elizabeth &s;tarted up in high indignation, and reproaching Lord Arlington as not le&s;s mad than my|&s;elf, in thus obtruding me upon her, retired precipitately to her clo&s;et. Not much more &s;en&s;ible than my&s;elf, through a&s;toni&s;hment at a conduct &s;o unexpected on my part, he &s;oon &s;o far recovered his faculties, as to

A pre&s;entiment of the fact as the croud approached, made him eagerly &s;tart up, and re&s;igning him&s;elf to the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment, he ru&s;hed through them all, and &s;natching me with impetuo&s;ity from tho&s;e who held me, placed me on the couch, and kneeling be&s;ide it, &s;ought to re-animate my chilled &s;en&s;es with burn|ing tears, and agonized embraces. A thou&s;and times he called me "his dear betrothed love&mdash;his murdered, precious Ellinor,&mdash;here is &s;ome black artifice, &s;ome diabolical villainy in this bu&s;ine&s;s," would he cry, &s;tarting up haughtily, and throw|ing his inflamed eyes around, in dread|ful

<P>This &s;cene, which every following mo|ment threatened to make fatal, was at la&s;t interrupted by the appearance of Lady Pembroke. The excellent under&s;tanding of that amiable woman, had made her from the fir&s;t con&s;ider my de&s;ire of appearing at Court (even while unapprized of its mo|tives) as the wild &s;tart of an un&s;ettled mind: &s;he had employed intreaty and ar|gument in vain to make me give it up; finding the project alike agreeable to Lord Arlington and my&s;elf, &s;he became &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, but declined accom|panying me, and dreading &s;ome &s;trange event, retired to her own apartments in the palace, to tremble for it in &s;ecret. The news of my having frightened the

Queen, and broke up the Court, imme|diately reached her there. However of|fended at my ob&s;tinacy, &s;he was &s;hocked at its effects, and readily emerged to &s;erve and &s;ave me if po&s;&s;ible. Pre&s;&s;ing through the a&s;toni&s;hed croud, the fond extravagance of Lord E&s;&s;ex continually increa&s;ed, &s;he beheld me in his arms, and heard his lamentation. Amazement in her collected mind is but a momentary emotion. "What are you doing, my Lord? &s;aid &s;he, with an air which re|called even him&mdash;is this the way to reco|ver the &s;en&s;es, or rea&s;on of this dear un|fortunate? remember the re&s;pect due both to her and your&s;elf, and leave her entirely to my care." Neither prayers nor anger warped her from rectitude: &s;he com|manded her &s;ervants to bear me to her barge, and followed me her&s;elf. The di&s;tracted E&s;&s;ex held her by force, and vainly &s;olicited leave to attend me. With a dignity which eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes that charming woman, &s;he chid him for a madne&s;s not le&s;s extravagant than my own, though far more cen&s;urable, and

reque&s;ted her Lord to pay him an equal attention.</P>
<P>The women who followed me into the barge &s;prinkled me with water; that and the open air gradually revived tho&s;e facul|ties, &s;o long dormant, they &s;eemed gone for ever. I feebly lifted my head from the bo&s;om of Lady Pembroke, and won|dered awhile how I came there. A thou|&s;and gloomy uncertainties occurred to me, and a flood of tears at la&s;t &s;o far re|lieved me, as to &s;uffer my mind to fix on the fact. Lady Pembroke, perceiving I was capable of attending to her, &s;pared me the trouble of enquiring into the pa&s;t &s;cene by relating it; with &s;uch comments as an enlarged mind, and tender heart, would naturally dictate. My pul&s;es were yet low, and her gentle admonitions made a due impre&s;&s;ion. "Review the whole of this wild &s;cheme, my dear Ellinor, &s;aid &s;he, and I think you will unite with me in calling it &s;o.

A continuance of this conduct, even after I was able to quit my apartment, gave me a di&s;gu&s;t to your lover, I did not conceal from my Lord. He pleaded his unhappine&s;s, as his only, and indeed &s;ufficient excu&s;e, and thus laid him&s;elf open to my enquiries, which &s;oon obliged him to own the whole truth.

News happily arrived of Lord Leice&s;ter and Matilda, which renovating every hope in both him and me, I joined the deluder &s;elf in a&s;&s;uring him, he was de&s;tined to re&s;tore you to the noble exiles, and in receiving your hand, to unite him&s;elf at once in their happine&s;s and fate.</P>
<P>The romantic heroi&s;m interwoven in his character, made him readily li&s;ten to the&s;e plea&s;ing delu&s;ions; till a &s;trange ru|mour reached us one day, that you had been married to Lord Arlington, in the pre&s;ence of Lord Burleigh, and left by him at St. Vincent's Abbey. Impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;tronge&s;t reliance on your faith, E&s;&s;ex a&s;&s;erted it in the warme&s;t terms, and &s;eemed ready to fly to the &s;pot where it was reported you yet exi&s;ted. The palene&s;s of my countenance reproved his implicit confidence. The name of Bur|leigh, the remembrance Arlington had lately quitted the Court, that intuitive &s;en&s;e which arranges and combines a

thou&s;and important nothings, tending to &s;tamp a &s;ad conviction more in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly than one can pronounce a &s;en|tence, now told me that this was true.&mdash;Lord Pembroke propo&s;ed going to the Mini&s;ter, and thus deciding the point. We gladly con&s;ented, and E&s;&s;ex tra|ver&s;ing the room in great agitation dur|ing the interval, found a thou&s;and rea|&s;ons to ju&s;tify his opinion; &s;o cautiou&s;ly collected, as &s;hewed he was not without a &s;ecret fear. Lord Pembroke at length returned, and confirming the fatal news, added, Lord Burleigh had &s;hewn him the contract, &s;igned by both. But what was the palene&s;s impre&s;&s;ed on my counte|nance, to that which &s;pread over the flo|rid complexion of your lover at this fatal confirmation! The &s;ilent &s;truggle in his &s;oul, &s;urely combined every pang of death, without affording its relief.&mdash;Speech and colour at la&s;t returned; his complexion now glowed with indignation, while his lips trembled with tran&s;ports of bitterne&s;s and grief. He quitted us pre|cipitately, and my Lord devoting him|&s;elf
<PB N="261" REF="263">
to a&s;&s;uage my &s;orrow, was not im|mediately &s;en&s;ible of the departure of our friend. Alas! could either of us po&s;&s;ibly have &s;u&s;pected the fate, the untoward fate, that awaited him!</P>
<P>The moment Lord E&s;&s;ex thus abrupt|ly quitted our hou&s;e, he ha&s;tened to that of Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham; where he found only Lady Sydney, who, &s;ecretly as &s;en&s;ible of his merit, as &s;he had before been of my brother's, received him with equal &s;urprize and plea&s;ure. Without entering into the motives which influenc|ed his conduct, he eagerly tendered him|&s;elf to her acceptance. Her objections were tho&s;e of one who wi&s;hed to be per|&s;uaded, and he would neither hear of de|mur or delay: his own Chaplain was quickly &s;ummoned, and the marriage &s;o|lemnized in a manner, almo&s;t as &s;udden and &s;olitary as your own.&mdash;Ah, fatal marriages both! beginning and ending in tears!&mdash;This news broke upon us with the morning. Lord Pembroke was a&s;|tounded. I recommended to him to ha&s;ten to the wretched bridegroom, and

reconcile his mind to the unlucky choice he had thus precipitately made, ere ra&s;h expre&s;&s;ions of grief or di&s;appointment &s;hould rou&s;e that turbulent &s;pirit which made my amiable brother's philo&s;ophy &s;o &s;oon give way to di&s;gu&s;t. Well we knew the fiery &s;oul of E&s;&s;ex would &s;purn at &s;uch a bondage, however voluntary.</P>
<P>The contempt and coldne&s;s both Lord Pembroke and my&s;elf had always &s;hewn to this imperious woman, who fir&s;t intro|duced di&s;cord into a family, before di&s;|tingui&s;hed by unanimity, rendered this a great effort of friend&s;hip. The time lo&s;t in reconciling our feelings to the conde|&s;cen&s;ion, made it wholly u&s;ele&s;s. My Lord found Sir Francis almo&s;t annihilated with &s;urprize, and under&s;tood at once that his daughter was in fits, and Lord E&s;&s;ex gone. Unable wholly to conceal the an|gui&s;h that preyed on his &s;pirits, and flat|tering him&s;elf a generous confidence in his bride might in time cement their union, by the charm of e&s;teem at lea&s;t, E&s;&s;ex had laid open his whole heart to her. The mortal hatred &s;he ever enter|tained
<PB N="263" REF="265">
both for your&s;elf and &s;i&s;ter, &s;he wanted judgment at this period to &s;tifle. The melancholy E&s;&s;ex, who &s;ought for pity, not pa&s;&s;ion, incautiou&s;ly defended her he had unwarily arraigned. The vindictive temper of his bride, blazed forth in all its littlene&s;s, and the quarrel ro&s;e &s;o high, that early the next morning he ordered his hor&s;es, and calling her at once, "his error and his puni&s;hment," he took his leave, with the bitter remark, that "he followed in all things the fate of Sir Philip Sydney." A reproach like this might well &s;hock the mo&s;t callous heart: it threw Lady E&s;&s;ex into fits.&mdash;Regard|le&s;s of this, her Lord mounted, and de|parting with the utmo&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, was &s;oon out of the reach both of friends and enemies.</P>
<P>The Queen, who was every day more partial to E&s;&s;ex than &s;he had been the former one, in&s;en&s;ibly had &s;uffered him to take, both in her heart and court, the place of Lord Leice&s;ter. It was the opinion of many, that &s;he intended to marry him, and the rage this &s;tep of
<PB N="264" REF="266">
his excited in her, lent force to the ex|travagant conjecture. Deeply re&s;enting alike his ha&s;ty marriage, and abrupt de|parture, &s;he bani&s;hed his Lady the Court, nor did Sir Francis e&s;cape a reprimand, however unde&s;erving it.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex &s;oon fitted out &s;ome &s;hips, with which he joined Drake and Norris, and his fame daily endearing him more to the Queen, &s;he could hardly &s;upport that ap|pearance of re&s;entment &s;he thought due to his temerity, and ince&s;&s;antly langui&s;hed for his return.</P>
<P>We &s;oon had letters from the Earl, acknowledging the ra&s;h &s;tep he had taken in marrying, and that to avoid blu&s;hing for it in our pre&s;ence, he had thus exiled him&s;elf. Though pride made him &s;till &s;peak of you with acrimony, it was obvi|ous from the tenor of the whole letter, that he had quitted England, no le&s;s to avoid &s;eeing you, than living with the woman he had inve&s;ted with a legal right to make him unhappy. The generous anxiety he &s;hewed for your &s;i&s;ter in &s;end|ing, even at this juncture, Sir Walter

<P>He was not born for inaction; and &s;oon his daring &s;pirit employed the thoughts of the whole nation; when Eli|zabeth, who knew too well its pre&s;ent ex|ertions were but the wild efforts of di&s;|appointment and de&s;pair, relaxed at once from all her apparent rigor, and recalled him. Di&s;gu&s;t had &s;unk &s;o deep, that he &s;till he&s;itated, and nothing but her pe|remptory command could induce him to return. While in daily expectation of him, I received your fir&s;t letter. It con|tained not a word could inform me of your real &s;ituation, or the motives of an action &s;o eccentric, as your acceptance of Lord Arlington.

An opportunity &s;oon offered; nor was I mi&s;taken in my judg|ment. Lord E&s;&s;ex peru&s;ed it in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, and the conviction it con|veyed produced a &s;urpri&s;ing alteration in his mind and manners. No &s;ymptom of either pride, pa&s;&s;ion, or di&s;appointment, from that moment, has been vi&s;ible in his conduct. Conforming at once to his fate, he profited by the indulgence of the Queen, and re&s;olved to live decently with his wife, if not happily. Never &s;ince have I heard your name from his lips&mdash;I knew not it lived even in his heart; and finding this artifice &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with one, I re&s;olved to try it with the other, When you related to me the cruel fiction by which Lord Burleigh wrought upon

The high &s;en&s;e you entertained of a &s;acrifice, apparently unvalued by him, made it improbable any explanation, or even conver&s;ation, &s;hould take place between minds thus deeply and ju&s;tly offended with each other. How then was I chagrined to &s;ee you, on your arrival in London, fondly nouri&s;h &s;ome unfathomable project, which threatened wholly to defeat mine! Find|ing all advice ineffectual, I thought it mo&s;t judicious to leave your mind to its own workings; hoping the gentlene&s;s of your nature, would counteract the irri|tation of your pa&s;&s;ions. Alas, my dear, this fatal day &s;hews me my error, and its extent. In how many ways will you now wound the noble heart of E&s;&s;ex!&mdash;Tor|tured at once with the angui&s;h of di&s;ap|pointed, injured love, the narrow doubts of his untractable wife, and the arrogant vigilance of the Queen, his life will, from

this moment, be as devoid of comfort, as it has long been of hope."</P>
<P>The tender motives which dictated this late confe&s;&s;ion, as well as the pa&s;t concealment; the melancholy inference with which Lady Pembroke concluded, all made a deep impre&s;&s;ion, and opened every &s;luice of tenderne&s;s, to the great relief of my oppre&s;&s;ed and burning heart. "No, my generous, amiable friend, re|turned I in a more equal tone than Lady Pembroke expected, I cannot mi&s;con|&s;true conduct which has ever had the mo&s;t upright intention; and in doing ju&s;tice to that of the afflicted E&s;&s;ex, you &s;upply me motives for an exertion I &s;hould otherwi&s;e &s;ink under. The nece&s;&s;ity for prevent|ing a part of the evils my imprudence may occa&s;ion, will recall me to rea&s;on, honor, and my&s;elf.&mdash;Oh, thou! cried I, melting into tears, too dearly beloved, too deeply lamented, pardon me if I pa&s;s a dark and dewy cloud over the bright &s;tar of thy di&s;tingui&s;hed fortune: &s;oon will it emerge with undimini&s;hed &s;plen|dor, while I alone &s;hall drop in tears,

I find my fluctuating mind unequal to entering further on the intere&s;ting &s;ubject, concluded I on arriv|ing at home. Adieu, my dear Lady Pembroke, be this embrace the pledge of mutual pardon; and if you have not blu&s;hed for the la&s;t, as well as fir&s;t, time for your poor friend, her better &s;elf mu&s;t again de&s;ert her." She &s;trained me to the pure&s;t bo&s;om that ever beat, and left me once more alone, with that un&s;table coun&s;ellor, my own erring heart.</P>
<P>The return of Lord Arlington, exa&s;|perated by the rage of the Queen, and the &s;urmi&s;es of the Court, tried my firm|e&s;t re&s;olutions: perhaps even tho&s;e would have been unequal to the conflict, but that I remembered my promi&s;e to Lady Pembroke, and was determined to &s;up|ply a bright example to that noble lover,
<PB N="270" REF="272">
I now con&s;idered as equally unfortunate with my&s;elf. I remained from this pe|riod wholly at home, yet not without ex|pecting &s;ome intelligence from Lord E&s;|&s;ex; though I knew not how he could po&s;&s;ibly convey it. It reached me at la&s;t in the mo&s;t extraordinary manner. Lady Pembroke &s;eized the fir&s;t interval of lone|line&s;s to addre&s;s me. "Perplexed cir|cum&s;tances make &s;trange emi&s;&s;aries, &s;aid &s;he &s;ighing,&mdash;who would have imagined I &s;hould reque&s;t to convey the letter of Lord E&s;&s;ex to you, Ellinor? but finding him determined on thus addre&s;&s;ing you, I voluntarily undertook the tru&s;t, as well to judge of all that pa&s;&s;ed, as to prevent his humiliating him&s;elf and you to what|ever &s;ervant he could bribe, and perhaps, if he erred in his choice of a me&s;&s;enger, it would be to the ruin of your peace and reputation.</P>
<P>Hardly hearing this generous pream|ble, my eager eyes were fixed on the let|ter, and I gave the fair hand that held it the &s;pontaneous ki&s;s I was at fir&s;t tempt|ed to be&s;tow on the precious paper.&mdash;

Ah, how affecting were the emotions produced by the &s;ight of that well-known hand! His language was impa&s;&s;ioned, and incoherent&mdash;he accu&s;ed him&s;elf, me, the friends of both, and the over-ruling fate which actuated all. He &s;eemed a&s;|&s;ured fraud, my&s;tery, and a thou&s;and yet unknown execrable arts had been com|bined to &s;eparate us. He conjured me to di&s;cover both the per&s;ons and the means. He &s;poke of Lord Arlington rather as a weak tool in the hands of his more crafty enemies, than the object of that deep and eternal re&s;entment, which only &s;lept till I &s;upplied it one. "Scorn, continued he, the narrow prejudices of cu&s;tom, and your &s;ex, nor be wholly the &s;acrifice of &s;ituation. Dare to be &s;incere, and think an adherence to your fir&s;t &s;a|cred vows (vows, dear as inviolable) the true point of honor, of religion, and mo|rality.

made it an invariable rule never to pa&s;s the gate unaccompanied; yet Lord Ar|lington conceived an antipathy to this &s;olitary a&s;ylum every day increa&s;ed: I did not compliment him with a total for|bearance of the few amu&s;ements inno|cence and retirement allowed. Alas, I learnt from his conduct, that jealou&s;y, the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s and in&s;atiate of all our pa&s;&s;ions, mingles in the habit, even when driven out of the heart.&mdash;Had his love known the refinements common to that pa&s;&s;ion in a generous nature, he would have felt that an unhappy attachment is nouri&s;hed by &s;olitude and home; and that the per&s;on who once re&s;olves to ven|ture abroad, &s;hews a noble re&s;olution to contend with it. A thou&s;and times he haunted my foot&s;teps; he broke in upon my loneline&s;s. You would have thought he had taken plea&s;ure in beholding the tears and regrets he fir&s;t occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The dotage of the Queen became every day more manife&s;t; and even the blow, &s;he in one of her wild tran&s;ports gave E&s;|&s;ex, more di&s;graced her&s;elf than him.&mdash;

His intrepid re&s;entment&mdash;his uncourtly &s;incerity&mdash;his haughty retirement&mdash;every action of his life confirmed that admira|tion I &s;till thought my&s;elf entitled to cheri&s;h. The unbounded power he af|terwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when reconciled, &s;hew|ed the extravagance of her attachment; and Elizabeth, cruel, inexorable to me in every other in&s;tance, crowned to her own di&s;grace in this, the only wi&s;h &s;he had permitted me to retain.</P>
<P>After &s;everal ineffectual efforts to gain di&s;tinction at Court, Lord Arlington con|ceived him&s;elf injured, and by retiring wholly into the country, per&s;ecuted me the year round with his company. But not having a ta&s;te for the &s;ciences, nor any of tho&s;e re&s;ources a &s;trong under|&s;tanding involuntarily &s;upplies, even to the unfortunate, he exi&s;ted only while employed. Hawking, hunting, and fi&s;h|ing &s;pun out the tedious years, and a ru&s;|tic company often clo&s;ed the evening with intoxication. That apathy my exhau&s;t|ed pa&s;&s;ions had now &s;unk into, appeared to his undi&s;cern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> content; and

as his own love abated, he fancied mine increa&s;ed; till he made a di&s;covery his mo&s;t needy para&s;ite never &s;econded&mdash;that we were at length entirely happy.</P>
<P>To confirm this &s;urprizing happine&s;s, (which exi&s;ted only in his own imaginati|on, and perhaps owed its creation to con|tinual inebriation) he re&s;olved to exter|minate tho&s;e ruins where I had owned I pa&s;&s;ed my childhood, and which, he thought, &s;till kept alive embittered re|membrances time would otherwi&s;e era&s;e. His Steward &s;ugge&s;ted that the materials were wanted to erect a manufacture in the neighbourhood, and that the cutting down the &s;urrounding woods, now grown to valuable timber, would more than an|&s;wer to the expence incurred; while new plantations would at once open the pro&s;|pect on that &s;ide the Abbey, and deprive me of an inanimate object of affection, of which Lord Arlington &s;till entertained a jealou&s;y as exce&s;&s;ive as prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al met the &s;tronge&s;t oppo|&s;ition from me on every account; it was dreadful to think of annihilating every

To di&s;turb the &s;acred a&s;hes of my early protectors, and leave them expo&s;ed to the winds of Heaven, and the hands of the laborer&mdash;But it was yet more dreadful to me to ri&s;que the little peace I had been able to collect from the wreck of all my hopes&mdash;to wake wi&s;hes, which were perhaps torpid, only becau&s;e vain&mdash;to tempt Lord E&s;&s;ex to break the promi&s;e I had wrung from him&mdash;in &s;hort, to take the mo&s;t remote chance of again beholding him&mdash;for to prevent the daily regret I might experi|ence at being a &s;pectator of this di&s;agree|able metamorpho&s;is in my favourite &s;pot, Lord Arlington was determined to take me for that time to London. In vain I remon&s;trated; the &s;tronger my di&s;gu&s;t appeared, the le&s;s he imagined he had to dread; nor among his whole round of &s;uppo&s;itions, once thought it po&s;&s;ible I could fear my&s;elf. Painful experience now reminded me that the lea&s;t hint on this &s;ubject would be ruin, and every

My quickened pul&s;es were again animated by my heart, and I beheld even the palace without di&s;gu&s;t, becau&s;e E&s;&s;ex reigned there. Lady Pembroke met me with an embrace neither time or ab&s;ence had chilled. She &s;urveyed my amended looks with infinite &s;atisfaction, and flattered her&s;elf, becau&s;e I was no longer a &s;pec|tre, I was happy. Ah, much erring friend, the embers of that fatal fire tears had almo&s;t quenched, again were gradu|ally relighting!&mdash;I felt almo&s;t di&s;appoint|ed at hearing E&s;&s;ex was &s;till on the &s;eas; that crowned with victory at Cadiz, his valour had only been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his conduct. The &s;en&s;ation this news excited, rendered me &s;en&s;ible of the precipice on which I &s;tood, and thanking Heaven mo&s;t devoutly for his ab&s;ence, I acknow|ledged in it my &s;afety.</P>

The few friends fortune had left me welcomed my return with ardor; and in their &s;ociety my &s;ubdued &s;pirits might have found &s;ome relief, had I been per|mitted an unlimited &s;hare of it; but Lord Arlington &s;aw the world in a dif|ferent point of view when mingling with it, and at a di&s;tance. The habit of be|ing informed of every employment of mine he did not witne&s;s, had now grown upon him &s;o &s;trongly, that he laid an em|bargo on my time, and &s;uffered none of it to be pa&s;&s;ed out of his own hou&s;e, without he was of the party. Indigna|tion was by nature the marking feature of my &s;oul.&mdash;Alas, what &s;ufferings had it already entailed upon me!&mdash;This glar|ing in&s;ult at once &s;hocked my feelings, and &s;truck at my principles.&mdash;Tho&s;e traits of bitterne&s;s and wildne&s;s I had &s;trove to obliterated in &s;olitude and &s;ilence, again appeared in my character. I became &s;ullen and impenetrable&mdash;for my own &s;ake I forbore violence and error, but I no longer cared whether I was &s;uppo&s;ed to do &s;o.&mdash;Perhaps Lord Arlington was

not &s;o culpable as he at fir&s;t appeared; for the hatred of the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex in|exorably pur&s;ued me.&mdash;From the fatal mo|ment when I fainted at Court, &s;he believed her&s;elf licen&s;ed in her injurious &s;urmi&s;es: they had long known no bounds, and expecting her Lord home daily, &s;he by remote and artful in&s;inuations poi&s;oned the mind of mine, to &s;ecure her from any danger &s;hould E&s;&s;ex arrive.</P>
<P>Weak and misjudging woman!&mdash;had &s;he generou&s;ly &s;ympathized in the cruel events which robbed me of happine&s;s, to ca&s;t it away on her, my melting heart would have &s;pent its la&s;t breath in wi&s;h|ing that happine&s;s perpetuated. The pure&s;t mind alone attracts the venom of the world, as the ether the vapors of the earth; but like that, unle&s;s agitated to a &s;torm, &s;oon recovers its clearne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibly returns in ble&s;&s;ings the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s it exhaled. Far from meditat|ing any injury to the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, I re&s;pected too much the peace of her hu&s;band's mind to recall to his re|membrance,

a wretch born but to de|&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I did not think virtue her&s;elf would refu&s;e me one little &s;atis|faction, I could not but de&s;ire; a picture of the &s;torming of Cadiz had been drawn by a Spani&s;h painter taken there, and &s;ent by E&s;&s;ex to Lord Pembroke. Among the many portraits it pre&s;erved, his own was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous; and every one pro|nounced it the fine&s;t ever drawn. It at|tracted the curio&s;ity of all ranks of peo|ple, and the gallery it was placed in was &s;carcely ever empty. It was &s;o much the topic of di&s;cour&s;e, that fa&s;hion mu&s;t have excited a de&s;ire in me to &s;ee it, had my heart been unintere&s;ted. Yet the unrea|&s;onable jealou&s;y of Lord Arlington con|demned me to &s;ilence; nor dared I pro|po&s;e vi&s;iting Lady Pembroke at this cri|&s;is, le&s;t the de&s;ire &s;hould be con&s;trued into a proof of mental guilt. My na|ture &s;purned at the con&s;traint to which I found my&s;elf &s;ubjected; and my amiable friend (fearful I &s;hould &s;uffer in my in|tellects
<PB N="289" REF="291">
more &s;everely for the &s;elf-denial, than I po&s;&s;ibly could for the indulgence) planned a method by which &s;he thought the ill-effects of either guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>The Queen gave an entertainment at Greenwich, on the marriage of one of her favorites, to which &s;he invited the whole Court; and a variety of ma&s;ques, and other entertainments were projected.&mdash;Lady Pembroke could not di&s;pen&s;e with appearing there, nor could Lord Arling|ton. Convinced he mu&s;t for once be &s;afely ab&s;ent, &s;he propo&s;ed calling in her barge ere &s;he went to Greenwich, and conveying me to her hou&s;e, leaving me in the gallery, with orders to her &s;er|vants to attend me home whenever I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this project there was nothing di&s;|honourable or un&s;afe; and I embraced it readily. Lord Arlington, I knew, was to be at Greenwich in the morning, as the bridegroom was his relation, and I waited for the appointed moment with an impatience tho&s;e only who live like

me whole years upon a look can judge of.</P>
<P>Lady Pembroke executed this de&s;ign with as much facility as &s;he had formed it; and pa&s;&s;ing on to Greenwich, committed me to the care of her family, who were told it was my intention to copy a beau|tiful drawing of their Lady, fixed up in the gallery. How di&s;dainful of my&s;tery is a truly noble &s;oul! I &s;topt &s;hort on the thre&s;hold, and could I with|out &s;ingularity have ventured immedi|ately to return, I had not entered the hou&s;e. It was &s;ilent and &s;olitary; all but the inferior dome&s;tics having followed ei|ther their Lord or Lady. The &s;ervants who conducted me locked the door by which I entered, to guard me from in|truders, to whom this picture had accu&s;|tomed them.&mdash;Ah, how lively was my emotion, to behold the features indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on my heart, perpetuated with almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;trength and truth! In the act of wre&s;ting a &s;word (the inflamed eye of him who held it, &s;hewed had a

Fear and horror were however prevalent, and &s;eem|ed to check the &s;weetne&s;s of again be|holding him; for though my eyes &s;ur|veyed his form, my heart for the fir&s;t time &s;eemed to &s;hut him out, and fold

By a happine&s;s in my for|tune, ungue&s;&s;ed by him, and unfore&s;een by me, we walked in this gallery while con&s;ulting, and when left alone, the fa|tigue of my journey made me throw my|&s;elf on the couch in yon window, and draw the curtain, to indulge the drow&s;i|ne&s;s with which I was &s;eized. How &s;weet|ly was my &s;lumber di&s;turbed, by her who has broken &s;o many with &s;orrow!
