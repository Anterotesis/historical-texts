<P>WHEN I fir&s;t re&s;olved upon doing my &s;elf this Honour, I could not but indulge a certain Vanity in dating from this little Covert, where I have frequent|ly had the Honour of your Lord|&s;hip's Company, and received from you very many Obligations. The elegant Solitude of this Place, and
<PB REF="4">
the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures of it I owe to its being &s;o near tho&s;e Beautiful Man|nors wherein you &s;ometimes re&s;ide: It is not retiring from the World, but enjoying its mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;|&s;ings, when a Man is permitted to &s;hare in your Lord&s;hip's Conver&s;a|tions in the Country. All the bright Images which the Wits of pa&s;t Ages have left behind them in their Wri|tings, the noble Plans which the greate&s;t State&s;men have laid down for Admini&s;tration of Affairs, are equally the familiar Objects of your Knowledge. But what is peculiar to your Lord&s;hip above all the illu|&s;trious Per&s;onages that have appear|ed in any Age, is, that Wit and Learning have from your Example fallen into a new <HI>Aera.</HI> Your Pa|tronage has produced tho&s;e Arts, which before &s;hunned the Com|merce of the World, into the Ser|vice of Life; and it is to you we owe, that the Man of Wit has turn|ed him&s;elf to be a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s. The fal&s;e Delicacy of Men of Ge|nius,
<PB REF="5">
and the Objections which o|thers were apt to in&s;inuate again&s;t their Abilities for entring into Af|fairs, have equally vani&s;hed. And Experience has &s;hown, that Men of Letters are not only qualify'd with a greater Capacity, but al&s;o a grea|ter Integrity in the Di&s;patch of Bu|&s;ine&s;s. Your own Studies have been diverted from being the highe&s;t Or|nament, to the highe&s;t U&s;e to Man|kind, and the Capacities which would have rendered you the greate&s;t Poet of your Age, have to the Advan|tage of <HI>Great Britain</HI> been employ'd in Pur&s;uits which have made you the mo&s;t able and unbia&s;&s;ed Patriot. A vigorous Imagination, an exten|&s;ive Apprehen&s;ion, and a ready Judg|ment, have di&s;tingui&s;hed you in all the illu&s;trious Parts of Admini&s;tra|tion, in a Reign attended with &s;uch Difficulties, that the &s;ame Talents without the &s;ame Quickne&s;s in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them would have been incapable of Conquering. The natural Succe&s;s of &s;uch Abilities has advan|ced

you to a Seat in that illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, where you were received by a Crowd of your Relations. Great as you are in your Honours, and Per&s;onal Qualities, I know you will forgive, an humble Neighbour, the Vanity of pretending to a Place in your Friend&s;hip, and &s;ub&s;cribing him&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t <HI>Tatler</HI> I promi&s;ed &s;ome Explana|tion of Pa&s;&s;ages and Per&s;ons mention'd in this Work, as well as &s;ome Account of the A&s;&s;i|&s;tances I have had in the Performance. I &s;hall do this in very few Words; for when a Man has no De&s;ign but to &s;peak plain Truth, he may &s;ay a great deal in a very narrow Compa&s;s. I have in the Dedication of the Fir&s;t Volume made my Acknowledgments to Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> who&s;e plea|&s;ant Writings, in the Name of <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> crea|ted an Inclination in the Town towards any Thing that could appear in the &s;ame Di&s;gui&s;e. I mu&s;t acknowledge al&s;o, that at my fir&s;t entring upon this Work, a certain uncommon Way of Thinking, and a Turn in Conver&s;ation peculiar to that agree|able Gentleman, rendered his Company very ad|vantageous to one who&s;e Imagination was to be continually employed upon obvious and common Subjects, though at the &s;ame Time obliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten Method. His Ver&s;es on the <HI>Shower in Town,</HI> and the <HI>De|&s;cription of the Morning,</HI> are In&s;tances of the Happine&s;s of that Genius, which could rai&s;e &s;uch Plea&s;ing Idea's upon Occa&s;ions &s;o barren to an ordinary Invention.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
When I am upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> I mu&s;t not forget that Genealogy of the Family &s;ent to me by the Po&s;t, and written, as I &s;ince under|&s;tand, by Mr. <HI>Twi&s;den,</HI> who died at the Battle of <HI>Mons,</HI> and has a Monument in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey</HI> &s;uitable to the Re&s;pect which is due to his Wit and his Valour. There are through the Cour&s;e of the Work very many Incidents which were written by unknown Corre&s;pondents. Of this Kind is the Tale in the Second <HI>Tatler,</HI> and the Epi&s;tle from Mr. <HI>Downes</HI> the Prompter, with others which were very well received by the Publick. But I have only one Gentleman, who will be namele&s;s, to thank for any frequent A&s;&s;i|&s;tance to me, which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an Intimacy from Childhood, con|&s;idering the great Ea&s;e with which he is able to di&s;patch the mo&s;t entertaining Pieces of this Na|ture. This good Office he performed with &s;uch Force of Genius, Humour, Wit and Learning, that I fared like a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prince who calls in a powerful Neighbour to his Aid; I was undone by my Auxiliary; when I had once called him in, I could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Dependance on him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Hand writ the di&s;tingui&s;hing Cha|racters of Men and Women under the Names of <HI>Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, the Di&s;tre&s;s of the News-Writers, the Inventory of the Play|hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>the De&s;cription of the Thermo|meter,</HI> which I cannot but look upon as the great|e&s;t Embelli&s;hments of this Work.</P>
<P><PB REF="9" MS="y">
Thus for I thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay relating to the great Hands which have been concerned in the&s;e Volumes, with Relation to the Spirit and Genius of the Work; and am far from pretending to Mode&s;ty in making this Acknowledgment. What a Man obtains from the good Opinion and Friend|&s;hip of worthy Men, is a much greater Honour than he can po&s;&s;ibly reap from any Accompli&s;hments of his own. But all the Credit of Wit which was given me by the Gentlemen above-mentioned (with whom I have now accounted) has not been able to attone for the Exceptions made again&s;t me for &s;ome Raillery in Behalf of that learned Ad|vocate for the Epi&s;copacy of the Church, and the Liberty of the People, Mr. <HI>Hoadley.</HI> I mention this only to defend my &s;elf again&s;t the Imputation of being moved rather by Party than Opinion; and I think it is apparent, I have with the ut|mo&s;t Frankne&s;s allowed Merit wherever I found it, though joined in Intere&s;ts different from tho&s;e for which I have declared my &s;elf. When my <HI>Fa|vonius</HI> is acknowledged to be Dr. <HI>Smalridge,</HI> and the amiable Character of the Dean in the Sixty &s;ixth <HI>Tatler</HI> drawn for Dr. <HI>Atterbury,</HI> I hope I need &s;ay no more as to my Impartiality.</P>
<P>I really have acted in the&s;e Ca&s;es with Hone&s;ty, and am concerned it &s;hould be thought otherwi&s;e: For Wit, if a Man had it, unle&s;s it be directed to &s;ome u&s;eful End, is but a wanton frivolous Quality; all that one &s;hould value him&s;elf upon in this Kind is, that he had &s;ome honourable In|tention in it.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">
As for this Point, never Hero in Romance was carried away with a more furious Ambition to conquer Giants and Tyrants, than I have been in extirpating Game&s;ters and Duelli&s;ts And indeed, like one of tho&s;e Knights too, though I was calm before, I am apt to fly out again, when the Thing that fir&s;t di&s;turbed me is pre&s;ented to my Ima|gination. I &s;hall therefore leave off when I am well, and fight with Windmills no more: Only &s;hall be &s;o Arrogant as to &s;ay of my &s;elf, that in Spite of all the Force of Fa&s;hion and Prejudice, in the Face of all the World, I alone bewailed the Condition of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who&s;e Fortune and Life are at this Day precarious; while His E&s;tate is liable to the Demands of Game|&s;ters, through a fal&s;e Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice; and to the Demands of Duelli&s;ts, through a fal&s;e Sen&s;e of Honour. As to the Fir&s;t of the&s;e Orders of Men, I have not one Word more to &s;ay of them: As to the latter, I &s;hall conclude all I have more to offer agin&s;t them (with Re&s;pect to their being prompted by the Fear of Shame) by applying to the Duelli&s;t what I think Dr. <HI>South</HI> &s;ays &s;omewhere of the Lyar, <HI>He is a Coward to Man, and a Brave to God.</HI></P>

<P>THERE are &s;ome Occa&s;ions in Life, where|in Regards to a Man's &s;elf is the mo&s;t piti|ful and contemptible of all Pa&s;&s;ions; and &s;uch a Time certainly is when the true publick Spirit of a Nation is run into a Faction again&s;t their Friends and Benefactors. I have hinted heretofore &s;ome Things which di&s;cover the real Sorrow I am in at the Ob&s;ervation, that it is now very much &s;o in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and have had the Honour to be pelted with &s;everal Epi&s;tles to expo&s;tulate with me on that Subject. Among others, one from a Per&s;on of the Number of tho&s;e they call <HI>Quakers,</HI> who &s;eems to admoni&s;h me out of pure Zeal and Good-will. But as there is no Character &s;o unju&s;t as that of talking in Party upon all Occa|&s;ions, without Re&s;pect to Merit or Worth on the

contrary Side, &s;o there is no Part we can act &s;o ju&s;tifiable as to &s;peak our Mind when we &s;ee Things urged to Extremity, again&s;t all that is Prai&s;e-worthy or valuable in Life, upon general and groundle&s;s Sugge&s;tions. But if I have talked too frankly upon &s;uch Reflections, my Cor|re&s;pondent has laid before me, after his Way, the Error of it in a Manner that makes me indeed thankful for his Kindne&s;s, but the more inclina|ble to repeat the Imprudence from the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Circum&s;tance.</P>

<P>FOra&s;much as I love thee, I cannot any lon|ger refrain declaring my Mind unto thee concerning &s;ome Things. Thou did&s;t thy &s;elf indite the Epi&s;tle in&s;erted in one of thy late Lucubrations, as thou would&s;t have us call them: For verily thy Friend of Stone, and I &s;peak according to Knowledge, hath no Fin|gers; and tho' he hath a Mouth, yet &s;peaketh he not therewith; nor yet did that Epi&s;tle at all come unto thee from the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the Scarlet Whore. It is plain therefore, that the Truth is not in thee: But &s;ince thou would&s;t lye, could&s;t thou not lye with more Di&s;cretion? Wherefore &s;hould&s;t thou in&s;ult over the Af|flicted, or add Sorrow unto the Heavy of Heart? Truly this Gall proceedeth not from the Spirit of Meekne&s;s. I tell thee moreover, the People of this Land be marvelou&s;ly given to Change; in&s;omuch that it may lightly come to pa&s;s, that before thou art many Years nearer to thy Di&s;&s;o|lution, thou may&s;t behold him &s;itting on a high Place whom thou now laughe&s;t to Scorn: And then how wilt thou be glad to humble thy &s;elf to the Ground, and lick the Du&s;t of his Feet, that thou may&s;t find Favour in his Sight? If thou did&s;t meditate as much upon the Word as
<PB N="3" REF="13">
thou do&s;t upon the prophane Scribblings of the wi&s;e Ones of this Generation, thou would&s;t have remembred what happened unto <HI>Shimei,</HI> the Son of <HI>Gera</HI> the <HI>Benjamite,</HI> who cur&s;ed the good Man <HI>David</HI> in his Di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>David</HI> par|doned his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, yet was he afterwards taken as in a Snare by the Words of his own Mouth, and fell by the Sword of <HI>Solomon</HI> the chief Ruler. Furthermore, I do not remember to have heard in the Days of my Youth and Vanity, when, like thine, my Conver&s;ation was with the Gentiles, that the Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is <HI>Babylon,</HI> ever &s;ued unto the Men of <HI>Carthage</HI> for Tranquility, as thou do&s;t aver: Neither was <HI>Hannibal,</HI> the Son of <HI>Hamilcar,</HI> called Home by his Countrymen, till the&s;e &s;aw the Sword of their Enemies at their Gates; And then was it not Time for him, thinke&s;t thou, to return? It appeareth therefore that thou do&s;t prophe&s;y backwards, thou do&s;t row one Way, and look another; and indeed in all Things art thou too much a Time-&s;erver; yet &s;eeme&s;t thou not to con&s;ider what a Day may bring forth. Think of this, and take Tobacco.</P>

<P>If the zealous Writer of the above Letter has any Meaning, it is of too high a Nature to be the Subject of my Lucubrations. I &s;hall therefore wave &s;uch high Points, and be as u&s;eful as I can to Per&s;ons of le&s;s Moment than any he hints at. When a Man runs into a little Fame in the World, as he meets with a great deal of Reproach which he does not de&s;erve, &s;o does he al&s;o a great deal of E&s;teem to which he has in him&s;elf no Pre|ten&s;ions.

<P>IT is &s;ome Years ago &s;ince the Entail of the E&s;tate of our Family was altered, by pa&s;&s;ing a Fine in Favour of me (who now am in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it) after &s;ome others decea&s;ed. The Heirs-General, who live beyond Sea, were ex|cluded by this Settlement, and the whole E&s;tate is to pa&s;s in a new Channel after me and my Heirs. But &s;everal Tenants of the Lord&s;hip per&s;wade me to let them hereafter hold their Lands of me according to the old Cu&s;toms of the Barony, and not oblige them to act by the Limitations of the la&s;t Settlement. This, they &s;ay, will make me more popular among my Departments, and the ancient Va&s;&s;als of the E&s;tate, to whom any Deviation from the Line of Succe&s;&s;ion is always invidious.</P>

<P>OF all the Evils under the Sun, that of ma|king Vice commendable is the greate&s;t: For it &s;eems to be the Ba&s;is of Society, that Ap|plau&s;e and Contempt &s;hould be always given to proper Objects. But in this Age we behold Things for which we ought to have an Abhor|rence, not only received without Di&s;dain, but even valued as Motives of Emulation. This is na|turally the De&s;truction of Simplicity of Manners, Openne&s;s of Heart, and Genero&s;ity of Temper. When one gives ones &s;elf the Liberty to range, and run over in ones Thoughts the different Ge|nius's of Men which one meets in the World, one cannot but ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the Indi|rection and Artifice which is u&s;ed among Men, does not proceed &s;o much from a Degeneracy in Nature, as an Affectation of appearing Men of Con&s;equence by &s;uch Practices. By this Means it is, that a cunning Man is &s;o far from being a&s;hamed of being e&s;teemed &s;uch, that he &s;ecretly rejoices in it. It has been a Sort of Maxim, That the greate&s;t Art is to conceal Art; but I know not how, among &s;ome People we meet with, their greate&s;t Cunning is to appear cunning. There is <HI>Polypragmon</HI> makes it the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life to be thought a cunning Fellow, and thinks it a much greater Character to be terrible than agreeable. When it has once enter'd into a Man's Head to have an Ambition to be thought crafty, all other Evils are nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences. To
<PB N="7" REF="17">
deceive, is the immediate Endeavour of him who is proud of the Capacity of doing it. It is cer|tain, <HI>Polypragmon</HI> does all the Ill he po&s;&s;ibly can, but pretends to much more than he performs. He is contented in his own Thoughts, and hugs him&s;elf in his Clo&s;et, that though he is locked up there and doing nothing, the World does not know but that he is doing Mi&s;chief. To favour this Su&s;picion, he gives Half-Looks and Shrugs in his general Behaviour, to give you to under|&s;tand that you don't know what he means. He is al&s;o wonderfully adverbial in his Expre&s;&s;ions, and breaks off with a Perhaps and a Nod of the Head, upon Matters of the mo&s;t indifferent Na|ture. It is a mighty Practice with Men of this Genius to avoid frequent Appearance in Publick, and to be as my&s;terious as po&s;&s;ible when they do come into Company. There is nothing to be done, according to them, the common Way; and let the Matter in Hand be what it will, it mu&s;t be carried with an Air of Importance, and tran&s;|acted, if we may &s;o &s;peak, with an o&s;tentatious Secrecy. The&s;e are your Per&s;ons of long Heads, who would fain make the World believe their Thoughts and Idea's are very much &s;uperior to their Neighbours, and do not value what the&s;e their Neighbours think of them, provided they do not reckon them Fools. The&s;e have &s;uch a Romantick Touch in Bu&s;ine&s;s, that they hate to perform any Thing like other Men. Were it in their Choice, they had rather bring their Pur|po&s;es to bear by over-reaching the Per&s;ons they deal with, than by a plain and &s;imple Manner. They make Difficulties for the Honour of &s;ur|mounting them. <HI>Polypragmon</HI> is eternally bu&s;ied after this Manner, with no other Pro&s;pect than that he is in Hopes to be thought the mo&s;t cun|ning of all Men, and fears the Imputation of Want of Under&s;tanding much more than that of the Abu&s;e of it. But alas! How contemptible is
<PB N="8" REF="18">
&s;uch an Ambition, which is the very Rever&s;e of all that is truly laudable; and the very Contra|diction to the only Means to a ju&s;t Reputation, Simplicity of Manners? Cunning can in no Cir|cum&s;tance imaginable be a Quality worthy a Man, except in his own Defence, and meerly to con|ceal him&s;elf from &s;uch as are &s;o; and in &s;uch Ca&s;es it is no longer Craft, but Wi&s;dom. The mon&s;trous Affectation of being thought artful, immediately kills all Thoughts of Humanity and Goodne&s;s, and gives Men a Sen&s;e of the &s;oft Affections and Impul&s;es of the Mind (which are imprinted in us for our mutual Advantage and Succour) as of meer Weakne&s;&s;es and Follies. Ac|cording to the Men of Cunning, you are to put off the Nature of a Man as fa&s;t as you can, and acquire that of a Daemon, as if it were a more eligible Character to be a powerful Enemy, than an able Friend. But it ought to be a Mortifica|tion to Men affected this Way, that there wants but little more than In&s;tinct to be con&s;iderable in it; for when a Man has arrived at being very bad in his Inclination, he has not much more to do, but to conceal him&s;elf, and he may revenge, cheat, and deceive, without much Employment for Under&s;tanding, and go on with great Chear|fulne&s;s with the high Applau&s;e of being a prodi|gious cunning Fellow. But indeed, when we ar|rive at that Pitch of fal&s;e Ta&s;te, as not to think Cunning a contemptible Quality, it is, methinks, a very great Inju&s;tice that Pickpockets are had in &s;o little Veneration, who mu&s;t be admirably well turned, not only for the Theoretick, but al|&s;o the Practical Behaviour of cunning Fellows. After all the Endeavour of this Family of Men, whom we call cunning, their whole Work falls to Pieces, if others will lay down all E&s;teem for &s;uch Artifices, and treat it as an unmanly Quali|ty, which they forbear to practi&s;e only becau&s;e they abhor it. When the Spider is ranging in

<P>Tho' the Ta&s;te of Wit and Plea&s;ure is at pre|&s;ent but very low in this Town, yet there are &s;ome that pre&s;erve their Reli&s;h undebauched with common Impre&s;&s;ions, and can di&s;tingui&s;h between Reality and Impo&s;ture. A Gentleman was &s;aying here this Evening, That he would go to the Play to Morrow Night to &s;ee Heroi&s;m, as it has been repre&s;ented by &s;ome of our Tragedians, repre|&s;ented in Burle&s;que. It &s;eems, the Play of <HI>Alex|ander</HI> is to be then turned into Ridicule for its Bomba&s;t, and other fal&s;e Ornaments in the Thought as well as the Language. The Blu&s;ter <HI>Alexander</HI> makes, is as much incon&s;i&s;tent with the Character of an Hero, as the Roughne&s;s of <HI>Clytus</HI> an In&s;tance of the Sincerity of a bold art|le&s;s Soldier. To be plain is not to be rude, but rather inclines a Man to Civility and Deference; not indeed to &s;how it in the Ge&s;tures of the Bo|dy, but in the Sentiments of the Mind. It is among other Things from the impertinent Fi|gures unskilful Dramati&s;ts draw of the Chara|cters of Men, that Youth are bewildered and pre|judiced in their Sen&s;e of the World, of which they have no Notions but what they draw from Books and &s;uch Repre&s;entations. Thus talk to a very young Man, let him be of never &s;o good Sen&s;e, and he &s;hall &s;mile when you &s;peak of Sin|cerity in a Courtier, good Sen&s;e in a Soldier, or Hone&s;ty in a Politician. The Rea&s;on of this is, That you hardly &s;ee one Play wherein each of the&s;e Ways of Life is not drawn by Hands that know nothing of any one of them: And the Truth is &s;o far of the oppo&s;ite Side to what they paint, that it is more impracticable to live in E&s;teem in Courts than any where el&s;e without Sincerity. Good
<PB N="10" REF="20">
Sen&s;e is the great Requi&s;ite in a Soldier, and Ho|ne&s;ty the only Thing that can &s;upport a Politi|cian. This Way of Thinking made the Gentle|man of whom I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking &s;ay, He was glad any one had taken upon him to depre|ciate &s;uch unnatural Fu&s;tian as the Tragedy of <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Character of that Prince indeed was, That he was unequal, and given to Intem|perance; but in his &s;ober Moments, when he had warm in his Imagination the Precepts of his great In&s;tructor, he was a Pattern of generous Thoughts and Di&s;po&s;itions, in Oppo&s;ition to the &s;tronge&s;t De&s;ires which are incident to a Youth and Con|queror. But in&s;tead of repre&s;enting that Hero in the glorious Character of Genero&s;ity and Cha&s;ti|ty, in his Treatment of the beauteous Family of <HI>Darius,</HI> he is drawn all along as a Mon&s;ter of Lu&s;t, or of Cruelty; as if the Way to rai&s;e him to the Degree of an Hero, were to make his Cha|racter as little like that of a worthy Man as po&s;|&s;ible. Such rude and indige&s;ted Draughts of Things are the proper Objects of Ridicule and Contempt, and depreciating <HI>Alexander,</HI> as we have him drawn, is the only Way of re&s;toring him to what he was in him&s;elf. It is well con|trived of the Players to let this Part be followed by a true Picture of Life, in the Comedy call'd, <HI>The Chances,</HI> wherein Don <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> are acted to the utmo&s;t Perfection. There need not be a greater In&s;tance of the Force of Action than in many Incidents of this Play, where indif|ferent Pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;uch that conduce only to the tacking of the Scenes together, are enlivened with &s;uch an agreeable Ge&s;ture and Behaviour, as apparently &s;hows what a Play might be, tho' it is not wholly what a Play &s;hould be.</P>

<P>SOme Years &s;ince I was engaged with a Coach full of Friends to take a Journey as far as the <HI>Land's-End.</HI> We were very well plea&s;ed with one another the fir&s;t Day, every one endeavouring to recommend him&s;elf by his good Humour and Complai&s;ance to the re&s;t of the Company. This good Corre&s;pondence did not la&s;t long; one of our Party was &s;owred the very fir&s;t Evening by a Plate of Butter which had not been melted to his Mind, and which &s;poiled his Temper to &s;uch a Degree, that he continued upon the Fret to the End of our Journey. A Second fell off from his good Humour the next Morning, for no other Rea&s;on that I could imagine, but becau&s;e I chanced to &s;tep into the Coach before him, and place my &s;elf on the &s;hady Side. This however was but my own private Gue&s;s, for he did not mention a Word of it, nor indeed of any Thing el&s;e, for Three Days following. The re&s;t of our Company held out very near half the Way, when of a &s;udden Mr. <HI>Sprightly</HI> fell a&s;leep; and in|&s;tead of endeavouring to divert and oblige us, as he had hitherto done, carried him&s;elf with an unconcerned, carele&s;s, drowzy Behaviour, till we came to uur la&s;t Stage. There were Three of us who &s;till held up our Heads, and did all we could to make our Journey agreeable; but, to my Shame be it &s;poken, about Three Miles on this Side <HI>Exeter,</HI> I was taken with an unaccountable
<PB N="12" REF="22">
Fit of Sullenne&s;s, that hung upon me for above Three&s;core Miles; whether it were for Want of Re&s;pect, or from an accidental. Tread upon my Foot, or from a fooli&s;h Maid's calling me <HI>The old Gentleman.</HI> I cannot tell. In &s;hort, there was but one who kept his good Humour to the <HI>Land's-End.</HI></P>
<P>There was another Coach that went along with us, in which I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that there were many &s;ecret Jealou&s;ies, Heart-burnings, and Ani|mo&s;ities: For when we joined Companies at Night, I could not but take Notice, that the Pa&s;|&s;engers neglected their own Company, and &s;tu|died how to make them&s;elves e&s;teemed by us, who were altogether Strangers to them; till at length they grew &s;o well acquainted with us, that they liked us as little as they did one another. When I reflect upon this Journey, I often fancy it to be a Picture of Humane Life, in Re&s;pect to the &s;everal Friend&s;hips, Contracts, and Alliances, that are made and di&s;&s;olved in the &s;everal Periods of it. The mo&s;t delightful and mo&s;t la&s;ting En|gagements are generally tho&s;e which pa&s;s between Man and Woman; and yet upon what Trifles are they weakened, or entirely broken? Sometimes the Parties fly a&s;under, even in the Mid&s;t of Court&s;hip, and &s;ometimes grow cool in the very Honey Month. Some &s;eparate before the Fir&s;t Child, and &s;ome after the Fifth; others continue good till Thirty, others till Forty; while &s;ome few, who&s;e Souls are of an happier Make, and better fitted to one another, travel on toge|ther to the End of their Journey in a continual Intercour&s;e of kind Offices and mutual Endear|ments.</P>
<P>When we therefore chu&s;e our Companions for Life, if we hope to keep both them and our &s;elves in good Humour to the la&s;t Stage of it, we mu&s;t be extreamly careful in the Choice we make, as well as in the Conduct on our own
<PB N="13" REF="23">
Part. When the Per&s;ons to whom we join our &s;elves can &s;tand an Examination, and bear the Scrutiny, when they mend upon our Acquain|tance with them, and di&s;cover new Beauties the more we &s;earch into their Characters, our Love will naturally ri&s;e in Proportion to their Per|fections.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there are very few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch Accompli&s;hments of Body and Mind, we ought to look after tho&s;e Qualifications both in our &s;elves and others, which are indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary towards this happy Union, and which are in the Power of every one to acquire, or at lea&s;t to cultivate and improve. The&s;e, in my Opinion, are Chearfulne&s;s and Con&s;tancy. A chearful Temper joined with Innocence, will make Beau|ty attractive, Knowledge delightful, and Wit good-natured. It will lighten Sickne&s;s, Poverty, and Affliction; convert Ignorance into an amia|ble Simplicity, and render Deformity it &s;elf agree|able.</P>
<P>Con&s;tancy is natural to Per&s;ons of even Tem|pers and uniform Di&s;po&s;itions, and may be ac|quired by tho&s;e of the greate&s;t Ficklene&s;s, Vio|lence and Pa&s;&s;ion, who con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the Terms of Union upon which they come together, the mutual Intere&s;t in which they are engaged, with all the Motives that ought to incite their Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e who have their Dependance upon them, and are em|barked with them for Life in the &s;ame State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery. Con&s;tancy, when it grows in the Mind upon Con&s;iderations of this Nature, becomes a Moral Virtue, and a kind of good Na|ture, that is not &s;ubject to any Change of Health, Age, Fortune, or any of tho&s;e Accidents which are apt to un&s;ettle the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;itions that are founded rather in Con&s;titution than in Rea&s;on. Where &s;uch a Con&s;tancy as this is wanting, the mo&s;t enflamed Pa&s;&s;ion may fall away into Cold|ne&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="24">
and Indifference, and the mo&s;t melting Ten|derne&s;s degenerate into Hatred and Aver&s;ion. I &s;hall conclude this Paper with a Story that is ve|ry well known in the North of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>About Thirty Years ago, a Packet-Boat that had &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers on Board was ca&s;t away upon a Rock, and in &s;o great Danger of &s;inking, that all who were in it endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves as well at they could, though only tho&s;e who could &s;wim well had a bare Po&s;&s;ibility of doing it. Among the Pa&s;&s;engers there were Two Women of Fa&s;hion, who &s;eeing them&s;elves in &s;uch a di&s;con&s;olate Condition, begged of their Husbands not to leave them. One of them cho&s;e rather to die with his Wife, than to for&s;ake her; the other, though he was moved with the ut|mo&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion for his Wife, told her, That for the Good of their Children it was better one of them &s;hould live, than both peri&s;h. By a great Piece of good Luck, next to a Miracle, when one of our good Men had taken the la&s;t and long Farewel in order to &s;ave him&s;elf, and the other held in his Arms the Per&s;on that was dearer to him than Life, the Ship was pre&s;erved. It is with a &s;ecret Sorrow and Vexation of Mind that I mu&s;t tell the Sequel of the Story, and let my Reader know, that this faithful Pair who were ready to have died in each others Arms, about Three Years after their E&s;cape, upon &s;ome tri|fling Di&s;gu&s;t, grew to a Coldne&s;s at fir&s;t, and at length fell out to &s;uch a Degree, that they left one another, and parted for ever. The other Couple lived together in an uninterrupted Friend|&s;hip and Felicity; and what was remarkable, the Husband whom the Shipwreck had like to have &s;eparated from his Wife, died a few Months after her, not being able to &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of her.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is &s;omething in the Changeablene&s;s and Incon&s;tancy of Humane Na|ture, that very often both dejects and terrifies
<PB N="15" REF="25">
me. Whatever I am at pre&s;ent, I tremble to think what I may be. While I find this Principle in me, How can I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf that I &s;hall be always true to my God, my Friend, or my &s;elf? In &s;hort, without Con&s;tancy there is neither Love, Friend&s;hip, or Virtue, in the World.</P>

<P>I Have of late received many Epi&s;tles, where|in the Writers treat me as a mercenary Per&s;on for &s;ome late Hints concerning Matters which they think I &s;hould not have touched upon but for &s;ordid Con&s;iderations. It is apparent, that my Motive could not be of that Kind; for when a Man declares him &s;elf openly on one Side, that Party will take no more Notice of him, becau&s;e he is &s;ure; and the Set of Men whom he declares again&s;t, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on are violent again&s;t him. Thus it is Folly in a Plain-Dealer to ex|pect, that either his Friends will reward him, or his Enemies forgive him. For which Rea&s;on, I thought it was the &s;horte&s;t Way to Impartiality, to put my &s;elf beyond further Hopes or Fears, by declaring my &s;elf, at a Time when the Di&s;|pute is not about Per&s;ons and Parties, but Things and Cau&s;es. To relieve my &s;elf from the Vexa|tion which naturally attends &s;uch Reflections, I came hither this Evening to give my Thoughts
<PB N="16" REF="26">
quite a new Turn, and conver&s;e with Men of Plea&s;ure and Wit, rather than tho&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Intrigue. I had hardly entered the Room, when I was acco&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Thomas Dogget,</HI> who de&s;ired my Favour in Relation to the Play which was to be acted for his Benefit on <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> He plea&s;ed me in &s;aying it was <HI>The Old Batchelor,</HI> in which Comedy there is a nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;tance ob&s;erv'd by the Author, which mo&s;t other Poets either overlook or do not under&s;tand, that is to &s;ay, the Di&s;tinction of Characters. It is very or|dinary with Writers to indulge a certain Mode&s;ty of believing all Men as witty as them&s;elves, and making all the Per&s;ons of the Play &s;peak the Sentiments of the Author, without any Manner of Re&s;pect to the Age, Fortune, or Quality, of him that is on the Stage. Ladies talk like Rakes, and Footmen make Similes: But this Writer knows Men. which makes his Plays rea&s;onable Enter|tainments, while the Scenes of mo&s;t others are like the Tunes between the Acts. They are per|haps agreeable Sounds, but they have no Idea's affixed to them. <HI>Dogget</HI> thanked me for my Vi|&s;it to him in the Winter, and, after his Comick Manner, &s;poke his Reque&s;t with &s;o arch a Leer, that I promi&s;ed the Drole I would &s;peak to all my Acquaintance to be at his Play.</P>
<P>Whatever the World may think of the Actors, whether it be that their Parts have an Effect on their Lives, or whatever it is, you &s;ee a wonder|ful Benevolence among them towards the Inte|re&s;ts and Nece&s;&s;ities of each other. <HI>Dogget</HI> there|fore would not let me go, without delivering me a Letter from poor old <HI>Downes</HI> the Prompter, wherein that Retainer to the Theatre de&s;ires my Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in a Matter of Concern to him. I have &s;ent him my private Opinion for his Conduct; but the Stage and the State Af|fairs being &s;o much canva&s;&s;ed by Parties and Fa|ctions, I &s;hall for &s;ome Time hereafter take Leave

of Subjects which relate to either of them, and employ my Care in the Con&s;ideration of Matters which regard that Part of Mankind who live without intere&s;ting them&s;elves with the Troubles or Plea&s;ures of either. However, for a meer Notion of the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of the Stage, I &s;hall give you the Letter at large as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 1. 1710.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding by divers of your late Papers, that you are a Friend to the Profe&s;&s;ion of which I was many Years an unworthy Member, I the rather make bold to crave your Advice, touch|ing a Propo&s;al that has been lately made me of coming again into Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Sub-Admini|&s;tration of Stage Affairs. I have, from my Youth, been bred up behind the Curtain, and been a Prompter from the Time of the Re&s;toration. I have &s;een many Changes, as well of Scenes as of Actors, and have known Men within my Remembrance arrive to the highe&s;t Dignities of the Theatre, who made their Entrance in the Quality of Mutes, Joint-&s;tools, Flower-pots, and Tape&s;try Hangings. It cannot be unknown to the Nobility and Gentry, That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep Intriguer, had &s;ome Time &s;ince worked him&s;elf into the &s;ole Management and Direction of the Theatre. Nor is it le&s;s notorious, That his re&s;tle&s;s Am|bition, and &s;ubtle Machinations, did manife&s;tly tend to the Extirpation of the good old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Actors, and the Introduction of foreign Pre|tenders; &s;uch as Harlequins, <HI>French</HI> Dancers, and <HI>Roman</HI> Singers; which, though they impo|veri&s;h'd the Proprietors, and impo&s;ed on the Audience, were for &s;ome Time tolerated, by Rea&s;on of his dextrous In&s;inuations, which pre|vailed upon a few deluded Women, e&s;pecially the Vizard Masks, to believe that the Stage was in Danger. But his Schemes were &s;oon
<PB N="18" REF="28">
expo&s;ed, and the Great Ones that &s;upported him withdrawing their Favour, he made his Exit, and remained for a Sea&s;on in Ob&s;curity. During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle, but &s;ecretly fomented Divi&s;ions, and wrought over to his Side &s;ome of the inferior Actors, re&s;erving a Trap Door to him&s;elf, to which only he had a Key. This Entrance &s;e|cured, this cunning Per&s;on, to compleat his Company, bethought him&s;elf of calling in the mo&s;t eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom. I have &s;een them all ranged toge|ther behind the Scenes; but they are many of them Per&s;ons that never trod the Stage before, and &s;o very aukward and ungainly, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe the Audience will bear them. He was looking over his Catalogue of Plays, and indeed picked up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces for Coun&s;ellors, to appear in the famous Scene of <HI>Venice Pre&s;erv'd,</HI> when the Danger is over; but they being but meer Out&s;ides, and the Actors having a great Mind to play <HI>The Tempe&s;t,</HI> there is not a Man of them, when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb Show, is capable of acting with a good Grace &s;o much as the Part of <HI>Trincalo.</HI> However, the Ma&s;ter per&s;i&s;ts in his De&s;ign, and is fitting up the old Storm; but I am afraid he will not be able to procure able Sailors or experienced Offi|cers for Love or Money.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, when he comes to ca&s;t the Parts, there is &s;o great a Confu&s;ion among&s;t them for Want of proper Actors, that for my Part I am wholly di&s;couraged. The Play with which they de&s;ign to open is, <HI>The Duke and no Duke;</HI> and they are &s;o put to it, that the Ma&s;ter him|&s;elf is to act the Conjurer, and they have no one for the General but hone&s;t <HI>George Powell.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, they being &s;o much at a Lo&s;s for the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae, viz.</HI> the Per&s;ons to enact,
<PB N="19" REF="29">
and the whole Frame of the Hou&s;e being de|&s;igned to be altered, I de&s;ire your Opinion, whether you think it advi&s;able for me to un|dertake to prompt 'em? For though I can cla&s;h Swords when they repre&s;ent a Battle, and have yet Lungs enough left to huzza their Victo|ries, I que&s;tion, if I &s;hould prompt 'em right, whether they would act accordingly. I am</P>

<P>I Was this Morning reading the Tenth Canto in the Fourth Book of <HI>Spencer,</HI> in which Sir <HI>Scudamore</HI> relates the Progre&s;s of his Court&s;hip to <HI>Amoret</HI> under a very beautiful Allegory, which is one of the mo&s;t natural and unmixed of any in that mo&s;t excellent Author.

only premi&s;e, That by the Shield of Love, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> meant a generous, con&s;tant Pa&s;&s;ion for the Per+&s;on beloved.</P>
<P>When the Fame, &s;ays he, of this celebrated Beauty fir&s;t flew Abroad, I went in Pur&s;uit of her to the <HI>Temple of Love.</HI> This Temple, continues he, bore the Name of the Godde&s;s <HI>Venus,</HI> and was &s;eated in a mo&s;t fruitful I&s;land, walled by Nature again&s;t all Invaders. There was a &s;ingle Bridge that led into the I&s;land, and before it a Ca&s;tle garri&s;on'd by Twenty Knights. Near the Ca&s;tle was an open Plain, and in the mid&s;t of it a Pillar, on which was hung the Shield of Love; and underneath it, in Letters of Gold, was this In&s;cription:</P>
<Q><L>Happy the Man who well can u&s;e his Bli&s;s;</L>
<L>Who&s;e ever be the Shield, Fair <HI>Amoret</HI> be his.</L></Q>
<P>My Heart panted upon reading the In&s;cription: I &s;truck upon the Shield with my Spear. Imme|diately i&s;&s;ued forth a Knight well mounted, and compleatly armed, who, without &s;peaking, ran fiercely at me. I received him as well as I could, and by good Fortune threw him out of the Sad|dle. I encountered the whole Twenty &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, and leaving them all extended on the Plain, carried off the Shield in Token of Victo|ry. Having thus vanqui&s;h'd my Rivals, I pa&s;&s;ed on without Impediment, till I came to the outer|mo&s;t Gate of the Bridge, which I found locked and barred. I knocked and called, but could get no An&s;wer. At la&s;t I &s;aw one on the other Side of the Gate, who &s;tood peeping through a &s;mall Crevice. This was the Porter; he had a double Face re&s;embling a <HI>Janus,</HI> and was continually looking about him, as if he mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;ome &s;ud|den Danger.

to be recovered. As &s;oon as the Porter &s;aw my Shield, he opened the Gate; but upon my en|tring, <HI>Delay</HI> caught hold of me, and would fain have made me li&s;ten to her Fooleries. However, I &s;hook her off, and pa&s;&s;ed forward till I came to the Second Gate, <HI>The Gate of good De&s;ert,</HI> which always &s;tood wide open, but in the Porch was an hideous Giant, that &s;top'd the Entrance: His Name was <HI>Danger.</HI> Many Warriors of good Reputation, not able to bear the Sternne&s;s of his Look, went back again. Cowards fled at the fir&s;t Sight of him, except &s;ome few, who watch|ing their Opportunity, &s;lipt by him unob&s;erv'd. I prepared to a&s;&s;ault him; but upon the fir&s;t Sight of my Shield, he immediately gave Way. Look|ing back upon him, I found his hinder Parts much more deformed and terrible than his Face; <HI>Hatred, Murther, Trea&s;on, Envy,</HI> and <HI>Detraction,</HI> lying in Ambu&s;h behind him, to fall upon the Heedle&s;s and Unwary.</P>
<P>I now entered <HI>The I&s;land of Love,</HI> which ap|peared in all the Beauties of Art and Nature, and fea&s;ted every Sen&s;e with the mo&s;t agreeable Objects. Amid&s;t a plea&s;ing Variety of Walks and Allies, &s;hady Seats, and flowry Banks, &s;un|ny Hills, and gloomy Valleys, were Thou&s;ands of Lovers &s;itting, or walking together in Pairs, and &s;inging Hymns to the Deity of the Place.</P>
<P>I could not forbear envying this happy People, who were already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all they could de&s;ire. While I went forward to the Temple, the Structure was beautiful beyond Imagination. The Gate &s;tood open. In the Entrance &s;at a mo&s;t amiable Woman, who&s;e Name was <HI>Concord.</HI></P>
<P>On either Side of her &s;tood Two young Men, both &s;trongly armed, as if afraid of each other. As I afterwards learned they were both her Sons, but begotten of her by Two different Fathers; their Names, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="32">
The Lady &s;o well tempered and reconciled them both, that &s;he forced them to join Hands, tho' I could not but ob&s;erve, that <HI>Hatred</HI> turned a&s;ide his Face, as not able to endure the Sight of his younger Brother.</P>
<P>I at length entered the Inmo&s;t Temple, the Roof of which was rai&s;ed upon an Hundred Marble Pillars, decked with Crowns, Chains, and Garlands. The Ground was &s;trowed with Flowers. An Hundred Altars, at each of which &s;tood a Virgin Prie&s;te&s;s cloathed in White, blazed all at once with the Sacrifice of Lovers, who were perpetually &s;ending up their Vows to Hea|ven in Clouds of Incen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t &s;tood the Godde&s;s her &s;elf, upon an Altar, who&s;e Sub&s;tance was neither Gold nor Stone, but infinitely more precious than either. About her Neck flew numberle&s;s Flocks of little <HI>Loves, Joys,</HI> and <HI>Graces;</HI> and all about her Altar lay &s;cattered Heaps of <HI>Lovers,</HI> complaining of the Di&s;dain, Pride, or Treachery, of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. One among the re&s;t, no longer able to contain his Griefs, broke out into the following Prayer: <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Venus,</HI> Queen of Grace and Beauty, Joy of Gods and Men, who with a Smile becalme&s;t the Seas, and renewe&s;t all Nature; Godde&s;s, whom all the different Species in the Univer&s;e obey with Joy and Plea&s;ure, grant I may at la&s;t obtain the Object of my Vows.'</Q></P>
<P>The impatient Lover pronounced this with great Vehemence; but I in a &s;oft Murmur be|&s;ought the Godde&s;s to lend me her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. While I was thus praying, I chanced to ca&s;t my Eye on a Company of Ladies, who were a&s;&s;em|bled together in a Corner of the Temple waiting for the Anthem.</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t &s;eemed &s;omething elder, and of a more compo&s;ed Countenance than the re&s;t, who all appeared to be under her Direction. Her Name was <HI>Womanhood.</HI> On one Side of her &s;at
<PB N="23" REF="33">
<HI>Shamefacedne&s;s,</HI> with Blu&s;hes ri&s;ing in her Cheeks, and her Eyes fixed upon the Ground: On the o|ther was <HI>Chearfulne&s;s,</HI> with a &s;miling Look, that infu&s;ed a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure into the Hearts of all that &s;aw her. With the&s;e &s;at <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> holding her Hand on her Heart; <HI>Courte&s;ie,</HI> with a grace|ful A&s;pect, and obliging Behaviour; and the Two Si&s;ters, who were always linked together, and re&s;embled each other, <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Thus &s;at they all around in &s;eemly Rate,</L>
<L>And in the Mid&s;t of them a goodly Maid;</L>
<L>Ev'n in the Lap of <HI>Womanhood</HI> there &s;ate,</L>
<L>The which was all in Lilly-white array'd,</L>
<L>Where Silver Streams among the Linen &s;tray'd;</L>
<L>Like to the Morn, when fir&s;t her &s;hining Face</L>
<L>Hath to the Gloomy World it &s;elf bewray'd.</L>
<L>That &s;ame was faire&s;t <HI>Amoret</HI> in Place,</L>
<L>Shining with Beauty's Light, and Heav'nly Vir|tue's Grace.</L></Q>
<P>As &s;oon as I beheld the charming <HI>Amoret,</HI> my Heart throbbed with Hopes. I &s;tepped to her, and &s;eized her Hand; when <HI>Womanhood</HI> imme|diately ri&s;ing up, &s;harply rebuked me for offer|ing in &s;o rude a Manner to lay hold on a Virgin. I excu&s;ed my &s;elf as mode&s;tly as I could, and at the &s;ame Time di&s;played my Shield; upon which, as &s;oon as &s;he beheld the God emblazoned with his Bow and Shafts, &s;he was &s;truck mute, and in&s;tantly retired.</P>
<P>I &s;till held fa&s;t the fair <HI>Amoret,</HI> and turning my Eyes towards the Godde&s;s of the Place, &s;aw that &s;he favoured my Preten&s;ions with a Smile, which &s;o emboldened me, that I carried off my Prize.</P>
<P>The Maid, &s;ometimes with Tears, &s;ometimes with Smiles, entreated me to let her go: But I led her through the Temple-Gate, where the Godde&s;s <HI>Concord,</HI> who had favoured my Entrance, befriended my Retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="34">
This Allegory is &s;o natural, that it explains it &s;elf. The Per&s;ons in it are very artfully de&s;cri|bed, and di&s;po&s;ed in proper Places. The Po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned to <HI>Doubt, Delay,</HI> and <HI>Danger,</HI> are admi|rable. The Gate of <HI>Good De&s;ert</HI> has &s;omething noble and in&s;tructive in it. But above all, I am mo&s;t plea&s;ed with the beautiful Grouppe of Fi|gures in the Corner of the Temple. Among the&s;e, <HI>Womanhood</HI> is drawn like what the Philo|&s;ophers call an Univer&s;al Nature, and is attended with beautiful Repre&s;entatives of all tho&s;e Vir|tues that are the Ornaments of the Female Sex, con&s;idered in its natural Perfection and Inno|cence.</P>

<P>THE Learned World are very much offend|ed at many of my Ratiocinations, and have but a very mean Opinion of me as a Politician. The Rea&s;on of this is, That &s;ome erroneou&s;ly conceive a Talent for Politicks to con&s;i&s;t in the Regard to a Man's own Intere&s;t; but I am of quite another Mind, and think the fir&s;t and e&s;&s;en|tial Quality towards being a State&s;man is to have a publick Spirit. One of the Gentlemen who are out of Humour with me, imputes my falling into a Way wherein I am &s;o very aukward to a Barrenne&s;s of Invention, and has the Charity to lay new Matter before me for the future. He is at the Bottom my Friend, but is at a Lo&s;s to know whether I am a Fool or a Phy&s;ician, and is plea&s;ed to expo&s;tulate with me with Relation to the latter. He falls heavy upon Licentiates, and &s;eems to point more particularly at us who are

not regularly of the Faculty. But &s;ince he has been &s;o civil to me as to meddle only with tho&s;e who are employed no further than about Men's Lives, and not reflected upon me as of the A&s;tro|logical Sect, who concern our &s;elves about Lives and Fortunes al&s;o, I am not &s;o much hurt as to &s;tifle any Part of his fond Letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am afraid there is &s;omething in the Su&s;pi|cions of &s;ome People, that you begin to be &s;hort of Matter for your Lucubrations. Tho' &s;everal of them now and then did appear &s;ome|what dull and in&s;ipid to me, I was always cha|ritably inclined to believe the Fault lay in my &s;elf, and that I wanted the true Key to unci|pher your My&s;teries, and remember your Ad|verti&s;ement upon this Account. But &s;ince I have &s;een you fall in an unpardonable Error, yea, with a Relap&s;e: I mean, &s;ince I have &s;een you turn Politician in the pre&s;ent unhappy Di&s;|&s;entions. I have begun to &s;tagger, and could not chu&s;e but le&s;&s;en the great Value I had for the Cen&s;or of our I&s;le. How is it po&s;&s;ible that a Man, whom Intere&s;t did naturally lead to a con&s;tant Impartiality in the&s;e Matters, and who hath Wit enough to judge, that his Opinion was not like to make many Pro&s;elytes? How is it po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that a little Pa&s;&s;ion (for I have &s;till too good an Opinion of you to think you was bribed by the Staggering Party) could blind you &s;o far as to offend the very better half of the Nation, and to le&s;&s;en off &s;o much the Number of your Friends? Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> will not have Cau&s;e to thank you, unle&s;s you give over, and endeavour to regain what you have lo&s;t. There is &s;till a great many Themes you have left untouched; &s;uch as the ill Manage|ments of Matters relating to Law and Phy&s;ick, the &s;etting down Rules for knowing the Quacks
<PB N="26" REF="36">
in both Profe&s;&s;ions. What a large Field is there left in di&s;covering the Abu&s;es of the College, who had a Charter and Privileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of Quacks and Pretenders; and yet grant Licences to Barbers, and write Letters of Recommenda|tion in the Country Towns, out of the Reach of their Practice, in Favour of meer Boys; va|luing the Health and Lives of their Country|men no farther than they get Money by them. You have &s;aid very little or nothing about the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Ju&s;tice in Town and Country, where Clerks are the Coun&s;ellors to their Ma|&s;ters.</P>
<P>But as I can't expect that the Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould publi&s;h a Letter, wherein he is cen&s;ured with too much Rea&s;on him&s;elf; yet I hope you will be the better for it, and think upon the Themes I have mentioned, which mu&s;t certainly be of greater Service to the World, your &s;elf, and Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> than to let us know whether you are a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> I am &s;till</P>

<P>This Gentleman and I differ about the Words, Staggering and Better Part; but in&s;tead of an|&s;wering to the Particulars of this Epi&s;tle, I &s;hall only acquaint my Corre&s;pondent, That I am at pre&s;ent forming my Thoughts upon the Founda|tion of Sir <HI>Scudamore</HI>'s Progre&s;s in <HI>Spencer,</HI> which has led me from all other Amu&s;ements, to con&s;i|der the State of Love in this I&s;land; and from the Corruptions in the Government of that, to deduce the chief Evils of Life. In the mean Time that I am thus employed, I have given po|&s;itive Orders to Don <HI>Saltero</HI> of <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> the Tooth-Drawer, and Dr. <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> the Corn-Cutter of <HI>King-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> (who have the Mo|de&s;ty

The&s;e Ad|vices I &s;hall re&s;erve for my future Lei&s;ure; but have now taken a Re&s;olution to dedicate the re|maining Part of this In&s;tant <HI>July</HI> to the Service of the Fair Sex, and have almo&s;t fini&s;hed a Scheme for &s;ettling the whole Remainder of that Sex who are unmarried, and above the Age of Twen|ty five.</P>
<P>In order to this good and publick Service, I &s;hall con&s;ider the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love in its full Ex|tent, as it is attended both with Joys and Inquie|tudes; and lay down, for the Conduct of my Lovers, &s;uch Rules as &s;hall bani&s;h the Cares, and heighten the Plea&s;ures, which flow from that amiable Spring of Life and Happine&s;s. There is no le&s;s than an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ion be made to take off the dead Stock of Wo|men in City, Town, and Country. Let there happen but the lea&s;t Di&s;order in the Streets. and in an In&s;tant you &s;ee the Inequality of the Num|bers of Males and Females. Be&s;ides that the Feminine Crowd on &s;uch Occa&s;ions is more nu|merous in the open Way, you may ob&s;erve them al&s;o to the very Garrets huddled together, Four at lea&s;t at a Ca&s;ement. Add to this, that by an exact Calculation of all that have come to Town by Stage-Coach or Waggon for this Twelvemonth la&s;t, Three Times in Four the treated Per&s;ons have been Males. This over-&s;tock of Beauty, for which there are &s;o few Bidders, calls for an im|mediate Supply of Lovers and Husbands; and I am the &s;tudious Knight-Errant who have &s;uffer'd long Nocturnal Contemplations to find out Me|thods for the Relief of all <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Females, who at pre&s;ent &s;eem to be devoted to involuntary Vir|ginity.

<P>THE intended Cour&s;e of my Studies was al|tered this Evening by a Vi&s;it from an old Acquaintance, who complained to me, mention|ing one upon whom he had long depended, that he found his Labour and Per&s;everance in his Pa|tron's Service and Intere&s;ts wholly ineffectual; and he thought now, after his be&s;t Years were &s;pent in a profe&s;&s;ed Adherence to him and his Fortunes, he &s;hould in the End be forced to break with him, and give over all further Ex|pectations from him. He &s;ighed, and ended his Di&s;cour&s;e, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'You, Mr. Cen&s;or, &s;ome Time ago, gave us your Thoughts of the Beha|viour of great Men to their Creditors.'</Q> This Sort of Demand upon them, for what they invite Men to expect, is a Debt of Honour, which, ac|cording to Cu&s;tom, they ought to be mo&s;t care|ful of paying, and would be a very worthy Sub|ject for a Lucubration.</P>
<P>Of all Men living, I think, I am the mo&s;t pro|per to treat of this Matter; becau&s;e in the Cha|racter and Employment of Cen&s;or, I have had Encouragement &s;o infinitely above my De&s;ert, that what I &s;ay cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from Peevi&s;hne&s;s, or any Di&s;appointment in that Kind which I my &s;elf have met with. When we con&s;ider Patrons and their Clients, tho&s;e who receive Addre&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e who are
<PB N="30" REF="40">
addre&s;&s;ed to, it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood that the Dependants are &s;uch as are worthle&s;s in their Natures, abandoned to any Vice or Di&s;honour, or &s;uch as without a Call thru&s;t them&s;elves upon Men in Power; nor when we &s;ay Patrons, do we mean &s;uch as have it not in their Power, or have no Obligation to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Friends; but we &s;peak of &s;uch Leagues where there are Power and Obligation on the one Part, and Merit and Expectation on the other. Were we to be very particular on this Subject, I take it, that the Di|vi&s;ion of Patron and Client may include a Third Part of our Nation. The Want of Merit and real Worth will &s;trike out about Ninety nine in the Hundred of the&s;e, and Want of Ability in the Patron will di&s;po&s;e of as many of that Or|der. He who out of meer Vanity to be applied to will take up another's Time and Fortune in his Service, where he has no Pro&s;pect of returning it, is as much more unju&s;t as tho&s;e who took up my Friend the Upholder's Goods without paying him for them. I &s;ay, he is much more unju&s;t, as our Life and Time is more valuable than our Goods and Moveables. Among many whom you &s;ee about the Great, there is a contented well|plea&s;ed Set, who &s;eem to like the Attendance for its own Sake, and are early at the Abodes of the powerful, out of meer Fa&s;hion. This Sort of Vanity is as well grounded, as if a Man &s;hould lay a&s;ide his own plain Suit, and dre&s;s him&s;elf up in a gay Livery of anothers.</P>
<P>There are many of this Species who exclude others of ju&s;t Expectation, and make tho&s;e pro|per Dependants appear impatient, becau&s;e they are not &s;o chearful as tho&s;e who expect nothing. I have made u&s;e of the Penny-Po&s;t for the In|&s;truction of the&s;e voluntary Slaves, and informed them, that they will never be provided for; but they double their Diligence upon Admonition. <HI>Will Afterday</HI> has told his Friends, that he was
<PB N="31" REF="41">
to have the next Thing the&s;e Ten Years; and <HI>Harry Linger</HI> has been Fourteen within a Month of a con&s;iderable Office. However, the fanta|&s;tick Complai&s;ance which is paid to them may blind the Great from &s;eeing them&s;elves in a ju&s;t Light, they mu&s;t needs (if they in the lea&s;t re|flect) at &s;ome Times have a Sen&s;e of the Inju&s;tice they do in rai&s;ing in others a fal&s;e Expectation. But this is &s;o common a Practice in all the Stages of Power, that there are not more Cripples come out of the Wars, than from the Attendance of Patrons. You &s;ee in one a &s;ettled Melancholy, in another a bridled Rage, a Third has lo&s;t his Memory, and a Fourth his whole Con&s;titution and Humour. In a Word, when you &s;ee a par|ticular Ca&s;t of Mind or Body, which looks a lit|tle upon the Di&s;tracted, you may be &s;ure the poor Gentleman has formerly had great Friends. For this Rea&s;on, I have thought it a prudent Thing to take a Nephew of mine out of a Ladies Service, where he was a Page, and have bound him to a Shoemaker.</P>
<P>But what of all the Humours under the Sun is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant to con&s;ider, is, That you &s;ee &s;ome Men lay as it were a Set of Acquaintance by them, to conver&s;e with when they are out of Employment, who had no Effect of their Power when they were in. Here Patrons and Clients both make the mo&s;t fanta&s;tical Figure imagina|ble. Friend&s;hip indeed is mo&s;t manife&s;ted in Adver&s;ity; but I do not know how to behave my &s;elf to a Man who thinks me his Friend at no other Time but that. <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> of our Club had this in his Head t'other Night, when he &s;aid, I am afraid of ill News when I am vi&s;ited by any of my old Friends. The&s;e Patrons are a little like &s;ome fine Gentlemen, who &s;pend all their Hours of Gaiety with their Wenches, but when they fall &s;ick, will let no one come near them but their Wives. It &s;eems, Truth and Honour
<PB N="32" REF="42">
are Companions too &s;ober for Pro&s;perity. It is certainly the mo&s;t black Ingratitude to accept of a Man's be&s;t Endeavours to be plea&s;ing to you, and return it with Indifference.</P>
<P>I am &s;o much of this Mind, that <HI>Dick Ea&s;tcourt</HI> the Comedian, for coming one Night to our Club, tho' he laughed at us all the Time he was there, &s;hall have our Company at his Play on <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> A Man of Talents is to be favoured, or never admitted. Let the ordinary World truck for Money and Wares, but Men of Spirit and Conver&s;ation &s;hould in every Kind do others as much Plea&s;ure as they receive from them. But Men are &s;o taken up with outward Forms, that they do not con&s;ider their Actions; el&s;e how &s;hould it be, that a Man &s;hall deny that to the Entreaties and almo&s;t Tears of an old Friend, which he &s;hall &s;olicit a new one to accept of? I remember, when I fir&s;t came out of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> I had an Intimacy with a Man of Quality, in who&s;e Gift there fell a very good Employment. All the Town cry'd, There's a Thing for Mr. <HI>Bick|er&s;taff!</HI> When, to my great A&s;toni&s;hment, I found my Patron had been forced upon Twenty Artifices to &s;urprize a Man with it who never thought of it: But &s;ure it is a Degree of Murder to amu&s;e Men with vain Hopes. If a Man takes away another's Life, where is the Difference, whether he does it by taking away the Minutes of his Time, or the Drops of his Blood? But in|deed, &s;uch as have Hearts barren of Kindne&s;s are &s;erved accordingly by tho&s;e whom they employ, and pa&s;s their Lives away with an empty Shew of Civility for Love, and an in&s;ipid Intercour&s;e of a Commerce in which their Affections are no way concerned. But on the other Side, How beauti|ful is the Life of a Patron who performs his Du|ty to his Inferiors? A worthy Merchant, who employs a Crowd of Artificers? A great Lord, who is generous and merciful to the &s;everal Ne|ce&s;&s;ities
<PB N="33" REF="43">
of his Tenants? A Courtier, who u&s;es his Credit and Power for the Welfare of his Friends? The&s;e have in their &s;everal Stations a quick Reli&s;h of the exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure of doing Good. In a Word, good Patrons are like the Guardian Angels of <HI>Plato,</HI> who are ever bu&s;y, though un&s;een, in the Care of their Wards; but ill Patrons are like the Deities of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> &s;u|pine, indolent, and unconcerned, though they &s;ee Mortals in Storms and Tempe&s;ts even while they are offering Incen&s;e to their Power.</P>

<P>WHEN I came hither this Evening, the Man of the Hou&s;e delivered me a Book very finely bound. When I received it, I over|heard one of the Boys whi&s;per another, and &s;ay, It was a fine Thing to be a great Scholar! What a pretty Book that is! It has indeed a very gay Out&s;ide, and is dedicated to me by a very inge|nious Gentleman, who does not put his Name to it. The Title of it (for the Work is in <HI>Latin</HI>) is, <HI>Epi&s;tolarum Ob&s;curorum Virorum, ad Dm. M. Or|tuinum Gratium, Volumina</HI> II. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "The Epi|&s;tles of the Ob&s;cure Writers to <HI>Ortuinus, &amp;c.</HI>" The Purpo&s;e of the Work is &s;ignified in the Dedi|cation, in very elegant Language, and fine Rail|lery. It &s;eems, this is a Collection of Letters which &s;ome profound Blockheads, who lived be|fore our Times, have written in Honour of each
<PB N="34" REF="44">
other, and for their mutual Information in each others Ab&s;urdities. They are mo&s;tly of the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Nation, whence from Time to Time Inun|dations of Writers have flow'd, more pernicious to the Learned World than the Swarms of <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> to the Politick. It is, methinks, wonderful, that Fellows could be awake, and utter &s;uch incoherent Conceptions, and conver&s;e with great Gravity like learned Men, without the lea&s;t Ta&s;t of Knowledge or good Sen&s;e. It would have been an endle&s;s Labour to have ta|ken any other Method of expo&s;ing &s;uch Imperti|nencies, than by an Edition of their own Works, where you &s;ee their Follies, according to the Am|bition of &s;uch Virtuo&s;i, in a mo&s;t correct Edition.</P>
<P>Looking over the&s;e accompli&s;h'd Labours, I could not but reflect upon the immen&s;e Load of Writings which the Commonalty of Scholars have pu&s;hed into the World, and the Ab&s;urdity of Parents, who educate Crowds to &s;pend their Time in Pur&s;uit of &s;uch cold and &s;prightle&s;s En|deavours to appear in Publick. It &s;eems there|fore a fruitle&s;s Labour to attempt the Correction of the Ta&s;t of our Contemporaries, except it was in our Power to burn all the &s;en&s;ele&s;s La|bours of our Ance&s;tors. There is a &s;ecret Pro|pen&s;ity in Nature from Generation to Generation in the Blockheads of one Age to admire tho&s;e of another; and Men of the &s;ame Imperfections are as great Admirers of each other, as tho&s;e of the &s;ame Abilities.</P>
<P>This great Mi&s;chief of voluminous Follies pro|ceeds from a Misfortune which happens in all Ages, that Men of barren Genius's, but fertile Imaginations, are bred Scholars. This may at fir&s;t appear a Paradox; but when we con&s;ider the talking Creatures we meet in publick Places, it will no longer be &s;uch. <HI>Ralph Shallow</HI> is a young Fellow, that has not by Nature any the lea&s;t Pro|pen&s;ity to &s;trike into what has not been ob&s;erved
<PB N="35" REF="45">
and &s;aid every Day of his Life by others; but with that Inability of &s;peaking any Thing that is uncommon, he has a great Readine&s;s at what he can &s;peak of, and his Imagination runs into all the different Views of the Subject he treats of in a Moment. If <HI>Ralph</HI> had Learning added to the common Chit-Chat of the Town, he would have been a Di&s;putant upon all Topicks that ever were con&s;idered by Men of his own Genius. As for my Part, I never am teazed by an empty Town-Fellow, but I ble&s;s my Stars that he was not bred a Scholar. This Addition, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, would have made him capable of maintaining his Follies. His being in the Wrong would have been protected by &s;uitable Arguments; and when he was hedged in by Logical Terms, and fal&s;e Appearances, you mu&s;t have owned your &s;elf convinced before you could then have got rid of him, and the Shame of his Triumph had been ad|ded to the Pain of his Impertinence.</P>
<P>There is a Sort of Littlene&s;s in the Minds of Men of wrong Sen&s;e, which makes them much more in&s;ufferable than meer Fools, and has the further Inconvenience of being attended by an endle&s;s Loquacity. For which Rea&s;on, it would be a very proper Work, if &s;ome Well-wi&s;her to humane Society would con&s;ider the Terms upon which People meet in publick Places, in order to prevent the un&s;ea&s;onable Declamations which we meet with there. I remember, in my Youth it was an Humour at the Univer&s;ity, when a Fel|low pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary, and had formed to him&s;elf a Plot to gain all our Admiration, or triumph over us with an Argu|ment, to either of which he had no Manner of Call; I &s;ay, in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, it was the Humour to &s;hut one Eye. This whim&s;ical Way of taking Notice to him of his Ab&s;urdity, has prevented many a Man from being a Coxcomb. If among&s;t us, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion each Man of|fered
<PB N="36" REF="46">
a voluntary Rhetorician &s;ome Snuff, it would probably produce the &s;ame Effect. As the Matter now &s;tands, whether a Man will or no, he is obliged to be informed in whatever another plea&s;es to entertain him with, tho' the Preceptor makes the&s;e Advances out of Vanity, and not to in&s;truct, but in&s;ult him.</P>
<P>There is no Man will allow him who wants Courage to be called a Soldier; but Men who want good Sen&s;e, are very frequently not only al|lowed to be Scholars, but e&s;teemed for being &s;uch. At the &s;ame Time it mu&s;t be granted, that as Courage is the natural Parts of a Soldier, &s;o is a good Under&s;tanding of a Scholar. Such little Minds as the&s;e, who&s;e Productions are collected in the Volume to which I have the Honour to be Patron, are the In&s;truments for artful Men to work with, and become popular with the un|thinking Part of Mankind. In Courts, they make tran&s;parent Flatterers; in Camps, o&s;tentatious Bullies; in Colleges, unintelligible Pedants; and their Faculties are u&s;ed accordingly by tho&s;e who lead them.</P>
<P>When a Man who wants Judgment is admitted into the Conver&s;ation of rea&s;onable Men, he &s;hall remember &s;uch improper Circum&s;tances, and draw &s;uch groundle&s;s Conclu&s;ions from their Di&s;cour&s;e, and that with &s;uch Colour of Sen&s;e, as would divide the be&s;t Set of Company that can be got together. It is ju&s;t thus with a Fool who has a Familiarity with Books, he &s;hall quote and recite one Author again&s;t another, in &s;uch a Man|ner as &s;hall puzzle the be&s;t Under&s;tanding to re|fute him; tho' the mo&s;t ordinary Capacity may ob|&s;erve, that it is only Ignorance which makes the Intricacy. All the true U&s;e of that we call Learn|ing, is to ennoble and improve our natural Fa|culties, and not to di&s;gui&s;e our Imperfections. It is therefore in vain for Folly to attempt to conceal it &s;elf by the Refuge of Learned Languages. Li|terature
<PB N="37" REF="47">
does but make a Man more eminently the Thing which Nature made him; and <HI>Poly|glottes,</HI> had he &s;tudied le&s;s than he has, and writ only in his Mother Tongue, had been known on|ly in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for a Pedant.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Caelia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to look back into the Fir&s;t Years of this young Lady, who&s;e Story is of Con&s;equence only as her Life has lately met with Pa&s;&s;ages very uncommon. She is now in the Twentieth Year of her Age, and owes a &s;trict, but chearful Education, to the Care of an Aunt, to whom &s;he was recommended by her dying Fa|ther, who&s;e Decea&s;e was ha&s;tened by an incon|&s;olable Affliction for the Lo&s;s of her Mother. As <HI>Caelia</HI> is the Offspring of the mo&s;t generous Pa&s;|&s;ion that has been known in our Age, &s;he is adorned with as much Beauty and Grace as the mo&s;t celebrated of her Sex po&s;&s;e&s;s; but her Do|me&s;tick Life, moderate Fortune, and religious Educaiton, gave her but little Opportunity, and le&s;s Inclination, to be admired in publick A&s;&s;em|blies. Her Abode has been for &s;ome Years a con|venient Di&s;tance from the Cathedral of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
<PB N="38" REF="48">
where her Aunt and &s;he cho&s;e to re&s;ide, for the Advantage of that rapturous Way of Devotion which gives Exta&s;y to the Plea&s;ures of Innocence, and, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, is the immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e Heavenly Enjoyments for which they are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As you may trace the u&s;ual Thoughts of Men in their Countenances, there appeared in the Face of <HI>Caelia</HI> a Chearfulne&s;s, the con&s;tant Companion of unaffected Virtue; and a Gladne&s;s, which is as in&s;eparable from true Piety. Her every Look and Motion &s;poke the peaceful, mild, re&s;igning, humble Inhabitant, that animated her beauteous Body. Her Air di&s;covered her Body a meer Ma|chine of her Mind, and not that her Thoughts were employed in &s;tudying Graces and Attractions for her Per&s;on. Such was <HI>Caelia</HI> when &s;he was fir&s;t &s;een by <HI>Palamede</HI> at her u&s;ual Place of Wor|&s;hip. <HI>Palamede</HI> is a young Man of Two and twenty, well-fa&s;hioned, learned, genteel, and di&s;|creet, the Son and Heir of a Gentleman of a very great E&s;tate, and him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a plenti|ful one by the Gift of an Unkle. He became enamoured with <HI>Caelia,</HI> and after having learned her Habitation, had Addre&s;s enough to commu|nicate his Pa&s;&s;ion and Circum&s;tances with &s;uch an Air of good Sen&s;e and Integrity, as &s;oon obtain'd Permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it and profe&s;s his Inclinations to|wards her. <HI>Palamede</HI>'s pre&s;ent Fortune and fu|ture Expectations were no Way prejudicial to his Addre&s;&s;es; but after the Lovers had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Time in the agreeable Entertainments of a &s;uc|ce&s;sful Court&s;hip, <HI>Caelia</HI> one Day took Occa&s;ion to interrupt <HI>Palamede</HI> in the Mid&s;t of a very plea|&s;ing Di&s;cour&s;e of the Happine&s;s he promi&s;ed him|&s;elf in &s;o accompli&s;hed a Companion, and a&s;|&s;uming a &s;erious Air, told him, there was another Heart to be won before he gained hers, which was that of his Father. <HI>Palamede</HI> &s;eemed much di&s;turbed at the Overture, and lamented to her,
<PB N="39" REF="49">
That his Father was one of tho&s;e too provident Pa|rents, who only place their Thoughts upon bring|ing Riches into their Families by Marriages, and are wholly in&s;en&s;ible of all other Con&s;iderations. But the Strictne&s;s of <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Rules of Life made her in&s;i&s;t upon this Demand; and the Son, at a proper Hour, communicated to his Father the Circum&s;tances of his Love, and the Merit of the Object. The next Day the Father made her a Vi&s;it. The Beauty of her Per&s;on, the Fame of her Virtue, and a certain irre&s;i&s;tible Charm in her whole Behaviour on &s;o tender and delicate an Oc|ca&s;ion, wrought &s;o much upon him, in Spight of all Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that he ha&s;tened the Marriage with an Impatience equal to that of his Son. Their Nuptials were celebrated with a Privacy &s;uitable to the Character and Mode&s;ty of <HI>Caelia,</HI> and from that Day, till a fatal one of la&s;t Week, they lived together with all the Joy and Happi|ne&s;s which attend Minds entirely united.</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been intimated, That <HI>Palamede</HI> is a Student of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and u&s;ually retired thi|ther early in a Morning, <HI>Caelia</HI> &s;till &s;leeping.</P>
<P>It happened a few Days &s;ince, that &s;he followed him thither to communicate to him &s;omething &s;he had omitted in her redundant Fondne&s;s to &s;peak of the Evening before. When &s;he came to his Apart|ment, the Servant there told her, &s;he was coming with a Letter to her. While <HI>Caelia</HI> in an Inner Room was reading an Apology from her Husband, That he had been &s;uddenly taken by &s;ome of his Acquaintance to dine at <HI>Brentford,</HI> but that he &s;hould return in the Evening, a Country Girl, de|cently clad, asked, If tho&s;e were not the Cham|bers of Mr. <HI>Palamede?</HI> She was an&s;wered, They were, but that he was not in Town. The Stranger asked, When he was expected at Home? The Ser|vant replied, She would go in and ask his Wife. The young Woman repeated the Word Wife, and fainted. This Accident rais'd no le&s;s Curio&s;ity
<PB N="40" REF="50">
when Amazement in <HI>Caelia,</HI> who cau&s;ed her to be removed into the Inner Room. Upon proper Ap|plications to revive her, the unhappy young Crea|ture returned to her &s;elf, and &s;aid to <HI>Caelia,</HI> with an earne&s;t and be&s;eeching Tone, Are you really Mr. <HI>Palamede</HI>'s Wife? <HI>Caelia</HI> replies, I hope I do not look as if I were any other in the Condition you &s;ee me. The Stranger an&s;wers, No, Madam, he is my Husband. At the &s;ame In&s;tant &s;he threw a Bundle of Letters into <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Lap, which con|firmed the Truth of what &s;he a&s;&s;erted. Their mu|tual Innocence and Sorrow made them look at each other as Partners in Di&s;tre&s;s, rather than Rivals in Love. The Superiority of <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Un|der&s;tanding and Genius gave her an Authority to examine into this Adventure as if &s;he had been offended again&s;t, and the other the Delinquent. The Stranger &s;poke in the following Manner:</P>
<Q>Madam,
<P>If it &s;hall plea&s;e you, Mr. <HI>Palamede</HI> having an Unkle of a good E&s;tate near <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> was bred at the School there, to gain the more his good Will by being in his Sight. His Unkle died, and left him the E&s;tate, which my Husband now has. When he was a meer Youth he &s;et his Affections on me; but when he could not gain his Ends he married me, making me and my Mother, who is a Farmer's Widow, &s;wear we would never tell it upon any Account what&s;oever; for that it would not look well for him to marry &s;uch a one as me; be&s;ides, that his Father would cut him off of the E&s;tate. I was glad to have him in an hone&s;t Way, and he now and then came and &s;tay'd a Night and away at our Hou&s;e. But very lately he came down to &s;ee us, with a fine young Gentleman his Friend, who &s;tay'd behind there with us, pretending to like the Place for the Summer; but ever &s;ince Ma&s;ter <HI>Palamede</HI> went, he has attempted to abu&s;e me;
<PB N="41" REF="51">
and I ran hither to acquaint him with it, and avoid the wicked Intentions of his fal&s;e Friend.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Caelia</HI> had no more Room for Doubt, but left her Rival in the &s;ame Agonies &s;he felt her &s;elf. <HI>Palamede</HI> returns in the Evening, and finding his Wife at his Chambers, learned all that had pa&s;|&s;ed, and ha&s;tened to <HI>Caelia</HI>'s Lodgings.</P>
<P>It is much ea&s;ier to imagine than expre&s;s the Sentiments of either the Criminal or the Injured at this Encounter.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as <HI>Palamede</HI> had found Way for Speech, he confe&s;&s;ed his Marriage, and his placing his Companion on Purpo&s;e to vitiate his Wife, that he might break through a Marriage made in his Nonage, and devote his riper and knowing Years to <HI>Caelia.</HI> She made him no An&s;wer; but retired to her Clo&s;et. He returned to the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he &s;oon after received from her the following Letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU, who this Morning were the be&s;t, are now the wor&s;t of Men who beath vital Air. I am at once overwhelmed with Love, Hatred, Rage, and Di&s;dain. Can Infamy and Innocence live to|gether? I feel the Weight of the one too &s;trong for the Comfort of the other. How bitter, Heaven, how bitter is my Portion? How much have I to &s;ay; but the Infant which I bear about me &s;tirs with my Agitation. I am, <HI>Palamede,</HI> to live in Shame, and this Creature be Heir to it. Farewel for ever.</P>

<P>WHEN we revolve in our Thoughts &s;uch Cata&s;trophes as that in the Hi&s;tory of the unhappy <HI>Caelia,</HI> there &s;eems to be &s;omething &s;o hazardous in the changing a &s;ingle State of Life into that of Marriage, that (it may happen) all the Precautions imaginable are not &s;ufficient to defend a Virgin from Ruin by her Choice. It &s;eems a wonderful Incon&s;i&s;tence in the Di&s;tribu|tion of publick Ju&s;tice, that a Man who robs a Woman of an Ear-ring or a Jewel, &s;hould be pu|ni&s;hed with Death; but one who by fal&s;e Arts and In&s;inuations &s;hould take from her her very &s;elf, is only to &s;uffer Di&s;grace. This excellent young Woman has nothing to con&s;olate her &s;elf with, but the Reflection that her Sufferings are not the Effect of any Guilt or Mi&s;conduct, and has for her Protection the Influence of a Power which, amid&s;t the unju&s;t Reproach of all Mankind, can give not only Patience, but Plea&s;ure to Innocence in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As the Per&s;on who is the Criminal again&s;t <HI>Caelia</HI> cannot be &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed according to our pre&s;ent Law, &s;o are there numberle&s;s unhappy Per&s;ons without Remedy according to pre&s;ent Cu&s;tom. That great Ill which has prevailed a|mong us in the&s;e latter Ages, is the making even Beauty and Virtue the Purcha&s;e of Money. The Generality of Parents, and &s;ome of tho&s;e of Qua|lity, in&s;tead of looking out for introducing Health of Con&s;titution, Frankne&s;s of Spirit, or Dignity of Countenance, into their Families, lay out all their Thoughts upon finding out Marches for their E&s;tates, and not their Children. You &s;hall have
<PB N="43" REF="53">
one form a Plot for the Good of his Family, that there &s;hall not be Six Men in <HI>England</HI> capable of pretending to his Daughter. A Second &s;hall have a Son obliged, out of meer Di&s;cretion, for fear of doing any Thing below him&s;elf, follow all the Drabs in Town. The&s;e &s;age Parents meet; and as there is no Pa&s;s, no Court&s;hip, between the young Ones, it is no unplea&s;ant Ob&s;ervation to behold how they proceed to Treaty. There is ever in the Behaviour of each &s;omething that denotes his Cir|cum&s;tance; and hone&s;t <HI>Coupler</HI> the Conveniencer &s;ays, he can di&s;tingui&s;h upon Sight of the Parties, before they have opened any Point of their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which of the Two has the Daughter to &s;ell. <HI>Coupler</HI> is of our Club, and I have frequently heard him declaim upon this Subject, and a&s;&s;ert, that the Marriage-Settlements which are now u&s;ed have grown fa&s;hionable even within his Memory.</P>
<P>When the Theatre in &s;ome late Reigns owed its chief Support to tho&s;e Scenes which were written to put Matrimony out of Countenance, and render that State terrible, then was it that Pin-Money fir&s;t prevailed, and all the other Articles in&s;erted which create a Diffidence; and intimate to the young People, that they are very &s;oon to be in a State of War with each other: Tho' this had &s;el|dom happened, except the Fear of it had been ex|pre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Coupler</HI> will tell you al&s;o, that Jointures were never frequent till the Age before his own; but the Women were contented with the Third Part of the E&s;tate the Law allotted them, and &s;corned to engage with Men whom they thought capable of abu&s;ing their Children. He has al&s;o in|formed me, that tho&s;e who were the olde&s;t Bench|ers when he came to the <HI>Temple</HI> told him, the fir&s;t Marriage-Settlement of con&s;iderable Length was the Invention of an old Serjeant, who took the Opportunity of Two Te&s;ty Fathers, who were ever &s;quabbling to bring about an Alliance be|tween their Children. The&s;e Fellows knew each
<PB N="44" REF="54">
other to be Knaves, and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual Diffidence, for the Benefit of the Law, to extend the Settlement to Three Skins of Parchment.</P>
<P>To this great Benefactor to the Profe&s;&s;ion is ow|ing the pre&s;ent Price Current of Lines and Words. Thus is Tenderne&s;s thrown out of the Que&s;tion; and the great Care is, What the young Couple &s;hall do when they come to hate each other? I do not que&s;tion but from this one Humour of Settle|ments, might very fairly be deduced not only our pre&s;ent Defection in Point of Morals, but al&s;o our Want of People. This has given Way to &s;uch un|rea&s;onable Gallantries, that a Man is hardly re|proachable that deceives an innocent Woman, tho' &s;he has never &s;o much Merit, if &s;he is below him in Fortune. The Man has no Di&s;honour fol|lowing his Treachery; and her own Sex are &s;o deba&s;ed by Force of Cu&s;tom, as to &s;ay in the Ca&s;e of the Woman, How could &s;he expect he would marry her?</P>
<P>By this Means the good Offices, the Plea&s;ures and Graces of Life, are not put into the Ballance: The Bridegroom has given his E&s;tate out of him|&s;elf and he has no more left but to follow the blind Decree of his Fate, whether he &s;hall be &s;ucceeded by a Sot, or a Man of Merit, in his Fortune. On the other Side, a fine Woman, who has al&s;o a Fortune, is &s;et up by Way of Auction; her fir&s;t Lover has Ten to One again&s;t him. The very Hour after he has opened his Heart and his Rent-Roll, he is made no other U&s;e of, but to rai&s;e her Price. She and her Friends lo&s;e no Opportunity of pub|li&s;hing it to call in new Bidders. While the poor Lover very innocently waits till the Plenipoten|tiaries at the Inns of Court have debated about the Alliance, all the Parti&s;ans of the Lady throw Difficulties in the Way, till other Offers come in; and the Man who came fir&s;t is not put in Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, till &s;he has been refu&s;ed by half the Town.
<PB N="45" REF="55">
If an Abhorrence to &s;uch mercenary Proceedings were well &s;ettled in the Minds of my Fair Read|ers, tho&s;e of Merit would have a Way opened to their Advancement: nay, tho&s;e who abound in Wealth only, would in Reality find their Account in it. It would not be in the Power of their Prude Acquaintance, their Waiters, their Nur&s;es, Cou&s;ins and Whi&s;perers, to per&s;wade them, that there are not above Twenty Men in a Kingdom, (and tho&s;e &s;uch as perhaps they may never &s;et Eyes on) whom they can think of with Di&s;cre|tion. As the Ca&s;e &s;tands now, let any one con&s;i|der, how the great Heire&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e to whom they were offered, for no other Rea&s;on but that they could make them &s;uitable Settlements, live together. What can be more in&s;ipid, if not loath|&s;ome, than for Two Per&s;ons to be at the Head of a Crowd, who have as little Regard for them as they for each other, and behold one another in an affected Sen&s;e of Pro&s;perity, without the lea&s;t Re|li&s;h of that exqui&s;ite Gladne&s;s at meeting, that &s;weet Inquietude at parting, together with the Charms of Voice, Look, Ge&s;ture, and that general Benevolence between well cho&s;en Lovers, which makes all Things plea&s;e, and leaves not the lea&s;t Trifle indifferent.</P>
<P>But I am diverted from the&s;e Sketches for fu|ture E&s;&s;ays, in Behalf of my numerous Clients of the Fair Sex, by a Notice &s;ent to my Office in <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> That a blooming Widow, in the Third Year of her Widowhood, and Twenty &s;ix of her Age, de&s;igns to take a Colonel of Twenty eight. The Parties reque&s;t I would draw up their Terms of coming together, as having a Regard to my Opinion again&s;t long and diffident Settle|ments; and I have &s;ens them the following In|denture: </P>

<P>HAving devoted the greater Part of my Time to the Service of the Fair Sex, I mu&s;t ask Pardon of my Men Corre&s;pondents if I po&s;tpone their Commands, when I have any from the La|dies which lie unan&s;wered. That which follows is of Importance.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU can't think it &s;trange if I, who know little of the World, apply to you for Ad|vice in the weighty Affair of Matrimony, &s;ince you your &s;elf have often declared it to be of that Con&s;equence as to require the utmo&s;t Delibera|tion. Without farther Preface therefore, give me Leave to tell you, that my Father at his Death left me a Fortune &s;ufficient to make me a March for any Gentleman. My Mother (for &s;he is &s;till alive (is very pre&s;&s;ing with me to marry; and I am apt to think, to gratify her, I &s;hall venture upon One of Two Gentlemen who at this Time make their Addre&s;&s;es to me. My Reque&s;t is, that you would direct me in my Choice; which that you may the better do, I &s;hall give you their Characters; and to avoid Confu&s;ion, de&s;ire you to call them by the Names of <HI>Philander</HI> and <HI>Sil|vius.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="57">
<HI>Philander</HI> is young, and has a good E&s;tate; <HI>Silvius</HI> is as young, and has a better. The for|mer has had a liberal Education, has &s;een the Town, is retired from thence to his E&s;tate in the Country, is a Man of few Words, and much gi|ven to Books. The latter was brought up un|der his Father's Eye, who gave him ju&s;t Learn|ing enough to enable him to keep his Accounts; but made him withal very expert in Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as Ploughing, Sowing, Buying, Selling, and the like. They are both very &s;o|ber Men, neither of their Per&s;ons is di&s;agreea|able, nor did I know which to prefer till I had heard them di&s;cour&s;e; when the Conver&s;ation of <HI>Philander</HI> &s;o much prevailed, as to give him the Advantage, with me, in all other Re&s;pects. My Mother pleads &s;trongly for <HI>Silvius,</HI> and u&s;es the&s;e Arguments, That he not only has the lar|ger E&s;tate at pre&s;ent, but by his good Husban|dry and Management increa&s;es it daily; That his little Knowledge in other Affairs will make him ea&s;y and tractable; whereas (according to her) Men of Letters know too much to make good Husbands. To Part of this I ima|gine I an&s;wer effectually, by &s;aying, <HI>Philander</HI>'s E&s;tate is large enough; That they who think 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year &s;ufficient, make no Difference be|tween that and Three. I ea&s;ily believe him le&s;s conver&s;ant in tho&s;e Affairs, the Knowledge of which &s;he &s;o much commends in <HI>Silvius;</HI> but I think them neither &s;o nece&s;&s;ary or becoming in a Gentleman as the Accompli&s;hments of <HI>Philander.</HI> It is no great Character of a Man to &s;ay, He rides in his Coach and Six, and under&s;tands as much as he who follows his Plough. Add to this, That the Conver&s;ation of the&s;e Sort of Men &s;eems &s;o di&s;agreeable to me, that tho' they may make good Bailiffs, I can hardly be per&s;waded they can be good Companions. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible I may &s;eem to have odd Notions, when I &s;ay I am
<PB N="48" REF="58">
not fond of a Man only for being of (what is called) a Thriving Temper. To conclude, I own I am at a Lo&s;s to conceive how good Sen&s;e &s;hould make a Man an ill Husband, or conver&s;ing with Books le&s;s complai&s;ant.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Re&s;olution which this Lady is going to take, &s;he may very well &s;ay is founded on Rea|&s;on: For after the Nece&s;&s;ities of Life are &s;erved, there is no manner of Competition between a Man of Liberal Education and an Illiterate. Men are not altered by their Circum&s;tances, but as they give them Opportunities of exerting what they are in them&s;elves; and a powerful Clown is a Tyrant in the mo&s;t ugly Form he can po&s;&s;ibly appear. There lies a &s;eeming Objection in the thoughtful Manner of <HI>Philander:</HI> But let her con&s;ider which &s;he &s;hall oftener have Occa&s;ion to wi&s;h, that <HI>Philander</HI> would &s;peak, or <HI>Silvius</HI> hold his Tongue.</P>

<P>IT has been often a&s;&s;erted in the&s;e Papers, That the great Source of our wrong Pur&s;uits is the impertinent Manner with which we treat Women, both in the common and important Circum&s;tan|ces of Life. In vain do we &s;ay, the whole Sex would run into <HI>England,</HI> while the Privileges which are allowed them, do no way ballance the
<PB N="51" REF="61">
Inconveniencies ari&s;ing from tho&s;e very Immuni|ties. Our Women have very much indulged to them in the Participation of our Fortunes and our Liberty; but the Errors they commit in the U&s;e of either, are by no means &s;o impartially con&s;i|dered, as the fal&s;e Steps which are made by Men. In the Commerce of Lovers, the Man makes the Addre&s;s, a&s;&s;ails, and betrays, and yet &s;tands in the &s;ame Degree of Acceptance as he was in before he committed that Treachery: The Woman, for no other Crime but believing one whom &s;he thought loved her, is treated with Shine&s;s and In|difference at the be&s;t, and commonly with Re|proach and Scorn. He that is pa&s;t the Power of Beauty, may talk of this Matter with the &s;ame Unconcern as of any other Subject: Therefore I &s;hall take upon me to con&s;ider the Sex, as they live within Rules, and as they tran&s;gre&s;s them. The ordinary Cla&s;s of the Good or the Ill have very little Influence upon the Actions of others; but the Eminent in either Kind are tho&s;e who lead the World below them. The Ill are employed in communicating Scandal, Infamy, and Di&s;ea&s;e, like Furies; the Good di&s;tribute Benevolence, Friend|&s;hip, and Health, like Angels. The Ill are damped with Pain and Angui&s;h at the Sight of all that is laudable, lovely, or happy. The Virtuous are touched with Commi&s;eration toward the Guilty, the Di&s;agreeable, and the Wretched. There are tho&s;e who betray the Innocent of their own Sex, and &s;ollicit the Lewd of ours. There are tho&s;e who have abandoned the very Memory, not only of Innocence, but Shame. There are tho&s;e who never forgave, nor could ever bear being forgi|ven. There are al&s;o who vi&s;it the Beds of the Sick, lull the Cares of the Sorrowful, and double the Joys of the Joyful. Such is the de&s;troying Fiend, &s;uch the Guardian Angel, Woman.</P>

<P>Before I withdraw from Bu&s;ine&s;s for the Night, it is my Cu&s;tom to receive all Addre&s;&s;es to me, that others may go to Re&s;t as well as my &s;elf, at lea&s;t as far as I can contribute to it. When I cal|led to know if any would &s;peak with me, I was informed that Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> the Player, de&s;ired to be admitted. He was &s;o, and with much Mode&s;ty acquainted me, as he did other People of Note, that <HI>Hamlet</HI> was to be acted on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> next for his Benefit. I had long wanted to &s;peak with this Per&s;on, becau&s;e I thought I could admoni&s;h him of many Things which would tend to his Improvement. In the General I ob&s;erved to him, That though Action was his Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Way to that Action was not to &s;tudy Ge&s;ture, for the Behaviour would follow the Sentiments of the Mind.</P>
<P>Action to the Player, is what Speech is to an Orator. If the Matter be well conceived, Words will flow with Ea&s;e: And if the Actor is well po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Nature of his Part, a proper Action will nece&s;&s;arily follow. He informed me, That <HI>Wilks</HI> was to act <HI>Hamlet,</HI> I de&s;ired him, to reque&s;t of him in my Name, That he would wholly for|get Mr. <HI>Betterton;</HI> for that he failed in no Part of <HI>Othello,</HI> but where he had him in View. An Actor's forming him&s;elf by the Carriage of ano|ther, is like the Trick among the Widows, who lament their Husbands as their Neighbours did theirs, and not according to their own Sentiments of the Decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is a Fault al&s;o in the Audience which in|terrupts their Satisfaction very much, that is, the figuring to them&s;elves the Actor in &s;ome Part wherein they formerly particularly liked him, and not attending to the Part he is at that Time performing. Thus, whatever <HI>Wilks,</HI> (who is
<PB N="54" REF="64">
the &s;tricte&s;t Follower of Nature) is acting, the vulgar Spectators turn their Thoughts upon Sir <HI>Harry Wildair.</HI> When I had indulged the Lo|quacity of an old Man for &s;ome Time in &s;uch loo&s;e Hints, I took my Leave of Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> and was told, Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e would &s;peak with me. His Bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;ire I would, as I am an A&s;trologer, let him know be|fore-hand who were to have the Benefit-Tickets in the en&s;uing Lottery; which Knowledge he was of Opinion he could turn to great Account, as he was concerned in News.</P>
<P>I granted his Reque&s;t, upon an Oath of Secrecy, That he would only make his own U&s;e of it, and not let it be publickly known till after they were drawn. I had not done &s;peaking, when he pro|duced to me a Plan which he had formed of keep|ing Books, with the Names of all &s;uch Adventu|rers, and the Numbers of their Tickets, as &s;hould come to him, in order to give an Hourly Account of what Tickets &s;hall come up during the whole Time of the Lottery, the Drawing of which is to begin on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> next. I liked his Method of di&s;gui&s;ing the Secret I had told him, and pronoun|ced him a thriving Man who could &s;o well watch the Motion of Things, and profit by a prevailing Humour and Impatience &s;o aptly, as to make his hone&s;t Indu&s;try agreeable to his Cu&s;tomers, as it is to be the Me&s;&s;enger of their good Fortune.</P>

<P>THIS Afternoon I went to vi&s;it a Gentleman of my Acquaintance at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Stepney</HI> Church-yard, I could not for|bear entertaining my &s;elf with the In&s;criptions on the Tombs and Graves. Among others, I ob|&s;erved one with this notable Memorial:</P>
<Q>Here lies the Body of T. B.</Q>
<P>This fanta&s;tical De&s;ire of being remembered only by the Two fir&s;t Letters of a Name, led me into the Contemplation of the Vanity and imperfect Attainments of Ambition in general. When I run back in my Imagination all the Men whom I have ever known and conver&s;ed with in my whole Life, there are but very few who have not u&s;ed their Faculties in the Pur&s;uit of what it is impo&s;&s;ible to acquire, or left the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they might have been (at their &s;etting out) Ma&s;ters, to &s;earch for it where it was out of their Reach. In this Thought it was not po&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="56" REF="66">
forget the In&s;tance of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who propo&s;ing to him&s;elf in Di&s;cour&s;e with a Philo&s;opher, one, and another, and another Conque&s;t, was asked, What he would do after all that? Then, &s;ays the King, we will make merry. He was well an|&s;wered, What hinders your doing that in the Con|dition you are already? The re&s;tle&s;s De&s;ire of ex|erting them&s;elves above the common Level of Mankind is not to be re&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome Tempers; and Minds of this Make may be ob&s;erved in every Condition of Life. Where &s;uch Men do not make to them&s;elves or meet with Employment, the Soil of their Con&s;titution runs into Tares and Weeds. An old Friend of mine, who lo&s;t a Ma|jor's Po&s;t Forty Years ago, and quitted, has ever &s;ince &s;tudied Maps, Encampments, Retreats, and Countermarches, with no other De&s;ign but to feed his Spleen and Ill-Humour, and furni&s;h him|&s;elf with Matter for arguing again&s;t all the &s;uc|ce&s;sful Actions of others. He that at his fir&s;t &s;et|ting out in the World was the gaye&s;t Man in our Regiment, ventured his Life with Alacrity, and enjoyed it with Satisfaction, encouraged Men below him, and was courted by Men above him, has been ever &s;ince the mo&s;t froward Crea|ture breathing. His warm Complexion &s;pends it &s;elf now only in a general Spirit of Contradiction; for which he watches all Occa&s;ions, and is in his Conver&s;ation &s;till upon Sentry, treats all Men like Enemies, with every other Impertinence of a &s;peculative Warrior.</P>
<P>He that ob&s;erves in him&s;elf this natural Inquie|tude, &s;hould take all imaginable Care to put his Mind in &s;ome Method of Gratification, or he will &s;oon find him&s;elf grow into the Condition of this di&s;appointed Major. In&s;tead of courting proper Occa&s;ions to ri&s;e above others, he will be ever &s;tudious of pulling others down to him: It being the common Refuge of di&s;appointed Ambition, to ea&s;e them&s;elves by Detraction. It would
<PB N="57" REF="67">
be no great Argument again&s;t Ambition, that there are &s;uch mortal Things in the Di&s;ap|pointment of it; but it certainly is a forcible Ex|ception, that there can be no &s;olid Happine&s;s in the Succe&s;s of it. If we value popular Prai&s;e, it is in the Power of the meane&s;t of the People to di&s;turb us by Calumny. If the Fame of being happy, we cannot look into a Village but we &s;ee Crowds in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we &s;eek only the Appearance. To this may be added, that there is I know not what Malignity in the Minds of ordinary Men to oppo&s;e you in what they &s;ee you fond of; and it is a certain Exception again&s;t a Man's receiving Applau&s;e, that he vi&s;ibly courts it. However this is not only the Pa&s;&s;ion of great and undertaking Spirts, but you &s;ee it in the Lives of &s;uch as one would believe were far enough re|moved from the Ways of Ambition. The Rural Squires of this Nation even eat and drink out of Vanity. A vain-glorious Fox-hunter &s;hall enter|tain half a County for the O&s;tentation of his Beef and Beer, without the lea&s;t Affection for any of the Crowd about him. He feeds them, becau&s;e he thinks it a Superiority over them that he does &s;o; and they devour him, becau&s;e they know he treats them out of In&s;olence. This in|deed is Ambition in Grote&s;que, but may figure to us the Condition of politer Men, who&s;e only Pur|&s;uit is Glory. When the Superior acts out of a Principle of Vanity, the Dependant will be &s;ure to allow it him; becau&s;e he knows it de&s;tructive of the very Applau&s;e which is courted by the Man who favours him, and con&s;equently makes him nearer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But as every Man living has more or le&s;s of this Incentive, which makes Men impatient of an unactive Condition, and urges Men to attempt what may tend to their Reputation, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould form to them&s;elves an Ambition which is in every Man's Power to
<PB N="58" REF="68">
gratify. This Ambition would be independent, and would con&s;i&s;t only in acting what to a Man's own Mind appears mo&s;t great and laudable. It is a Pur&s;uit in the Power of every Man, and is on|ly a regular Pro&s;ecution of what he him&s;elf ap|proves. It is what can be interrupted by no out|ward Accidents, for no Man can be robbed of his good Intention. One of our Society of the <HI>Trum|pet</HI> therefore &s;tarted la&s;t Night a Notion which I thought had Rea&s;on in it. It is, methinks, &s;aid he, an unrea&s;onable Thing, that Heroick Virtue &s;hould (as it &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent) be confined to a certain Order of Men, and be attainable by none but tho&s;e whom Fortune has elevated to the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Stations. I would have every Thing to be e&s;teemed as Heroick which is great and uncommon in the Circum&s;tances in the Man who performs it. Thus there would be no Virtue in humane Life which every one of the Species would not have a Pretence to arrive at, and an Ardency to exert. Since Fortune is not in our Power, let us be as little as po&s;&s;ible in hers. Why &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary that a Man &s;hould be rich, to be generous? If we mea&s;ured by the Quality, and not the Quantity, of Things, the Particulars which accompany an Action, is what &s;hould denominate it mean or great. The highe&s;t Station of humane Life is to be attained by each Man that pretends to it: For every Man can be as valiant, as generous, as wi&s;e, and as merciful, as the Faculties and Opportunities which he has from Heaven and Fortune will permit.

its own Worth is a Reward which it is not in the Power of Envy, Reproach, or Detraction, to take from it. Thus the Seat of &s;olid Honour is in a Man's own Bo&s;om, and no one can want Support who is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hone&s;t Con|&s;cience, but he who would &s;uffer the Reproaches of it for other Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I was going on in my Philo&s;ophy, when Notice was brought me, that there was a great Crowd in my Antichamber, who expected Au|dience.

I was much at a Lo&s;s how to ex|tricate my &s;elf from their Importunity; but ob|&s;erving the A&s;&s;embly made up of both Sexes, I &s;ignified to them, that in this Ca&s;e it would ap|pear Fortune is not blind, for all the Lots would fall upon the Wi&s;e&s;t and the Faire&s;t.

<P>IT is natural for the Imaginations of Men, who lead their Lives in too &s;olitary a Manner, to prey upon them&s;elves, and form from their own Conceptions Beings and Things which have no Place in Nature. This often makes an Adept as much at a Lo&s;s when he comes into the World as a meer Savage. To avoid therefore that Inepti|tude for Society, which is frequently the Fault of us Scholars, and has to Men of Under&s;tanding and Breeding &s;omething much more &s;hocking and untractable than Ru&s;ticity it &s;elf, I take Care to vi&s;it all publick Solemnities, and go into A&s;&s;em|blies as often as my Studies will permit. This being therefore the fir&s;t Day of the Drawing of the Lottery, I did not neglect &s;pending a con&s;ide|rable Time in the Crowd: But as much a Philo|&s;opher as I pretend to be, I could not but look with a Sort of Veneration upon the Two Boys which received the Tickets from the Wheels, as the impartial and equal Di&s;pen&s;ers of the For|tunes which were to be di&s;tributed among the Crowd, who all &s;tood expecting the &s;ame Chance. It &s;eems at fir&s;t Thought very wonderful, that one Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;o univer&s;ally have the Pre|eminence of another in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Men's Minds as that in this Ca&s;e; all in general have a &s;ecret Hope of the great Ticket: And yet Fear in another In&s;tance, as in going into a Battle &s;hall
<PB N="61" REF="71">
have &s;o little Influence, as that though each Man believes there will be many Thou&s;ands &s;lain, each is con&s;ident he him&s;elf &s;hall e&s;cape. This Cer|tainty proceeds from our Vanity; for every Man &s;ees abundance in him&s;elf that de&s;erves Reward, and nothing which &s;hould meet with Mortification. But of all the Adventurers that filled the Hall, there was one who &s;tood by me, who I could not but fancy expected the Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per An|num,</HI> as a meer Ju&s;tice to his Parts and Indu&s;try. He had his Pencil and Table-Book, and was at the drawing of each Lot, counting how much a Man with Seven Tickets was now nearer the great Prize, by the &s;triking out another, and ano|ther Competitor. This Man was of the mo&s;t par|ticular Con&s;titution I had ever ob&s;erved; his Pa&s;|&s;ions were &s;o active, that he worked in the ut|mo&s;t Stretch of Hope and Fear. When one Ri|val fell before him, you might &s;ee a &s;hort Gleam of Triumph in his Countenance, which imme|diately vani&s;hed at the Approach of another. What added to the Particularity of this Man, was, that he every Moment ca&s;t a Look, either upon the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Wheels, or the Boys. I gently whi&s;pered him, and asked, When he thought the Thou&s;and Pounds would come up? Pugh! &s;ays he, Who knows that? And then looks upon a little Li&s;t of his own Tickets, which were pretty high in their Numbers, and &s;aid it would not come this Ten Days. This Fellow will have a good Chance, though not that which he has put his Heart on. The Man is me|chanically turned, and made for getting. The Simplicity and Eagerne&s;s which he is in, argues an Attention to his Point; though what he is la|bouring at does not in the lea&s;t contribute to it. Were it not for &s;uch hone&s;t Fellows as the&s;e, the Men who govern the re&s;t of their Species would have no Tools to work with: For the outward Show of the World is carried on by &s;uch as can|not
<PB N="62" REF="72">
find out that they are doing nothing. I left my Man with great Reluctance, &s;eeing the Care he took to ob&s;erve the whole Conduct of the Per&s;ons concerned, and compute the Inequa|lity of the Chances with his own Hands and Eyes. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, they mu&s;t ri&s;e early that cheat you. Ay, &s;aid he, there's nothing like a Man's minding his Bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf. 'Tis very true, &s;aid I, The Ma&s;ter's Eye makes the Hor&s;e fat.</P>
<P>As it is much the greater Number who are to go without Prizes, it is but very Expedient to turn our Lecture to the forming ju&s;t Sentiments on the Subject of Fortune. One &s;aid this Morn|ing, That the Chief Lot he was con&s;ident would fall upon &s;ome Puppy; but this Gentle|man is one of tho&s;e wrong Tempers who approve only the Unhappy, and have a natural Prejudice to the Fortunate. But as it is certain that there is a great Meanne&s;s in being attacked to a Man purely for his Fortune, there is no le&s;s a Mean|ne&s;s in di&s;liking him for his Happine&s;s. It is the &s;ame Perver&s;ene&s;s under different Colours, and both the&s;e Re&s;entments ari&s;e from meer Pride.</P>
<P>The true Greatne&s;s of Mind con&s;i&s;ts in valuing Men apart from their Circum&s;tances, or accord|ing to their Behaviour in them. Wealth is a Di|&s;tinction only in Traffick; but it mu&s;t not be al|lowed as a Recommendation in any other Parti|cular, but only ju&s;t as it is applied. It was very prettily &s;aid, That we may learn the little Value of Fortune by the Per&s;ons on whom Heaven is plea|&s;ed to be&s;tow it. However, there is not a har|der Part in Humane Life, than becoming Wealth and Greatne&s;s. He mu&s;t be very well &s;tock'd with Merit, who is not willing to draw &s;ome Superiority over his Friends from his Fortune; For it is not every Man that can entertain with
<PB N="63" REF="73">
the Air of a Gue&s;t, and do good Offices with the Mien of one that receives them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cannot conceive how a Man can place him&s;elf in a Figure wherein he can &s;o much enjoy his own Soul, and that greate&s;t of Plea&s;ures, the ju&s;t Approbation of his own Actions, than as an Adventurer on this Occa&s;ion, to &s;it and &s;ee the Lots go off without Hope or Fear, perfectly unconcerned as to him&s;elf, but ta|king Part in the good Fortune of others.</P>
<P>I will believe there are happy Tempers in be|ing, to whom all the Good that arrives to any of their Fellow-Creatures gives a Plea&s;ure. The&s;e live in a Cour&s;e of &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting Happi|ne&s;s, and have the Satisfaction to &s;ee all Men en|deavour to gratify them. This State of Mind not only lets a Man into certain Enjoyments, but relieves him from as certain Anxieties. If you will not rejoice with happy Men, you mu&s;t re|pine at them. <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> alluded to this when he &s;aid, He would hate no Man out of pure Idle|ne&s;s. As for my own Part, I look at Fortune quite in another View than the re&s;t of the World; and, by my Knowledge in Futurity, tremble at the approaching Prize, which I &s;ee coming to a young Lady for whom I have much Tenderne&s;s; and have therefore writ her the following Let|ter, to be &s;ent by Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> with the Notice of her Ticket.</P>

<P>MAny are the Inconveniencies which happen from the improper Manner of Addre&s;s in common Speech, between Per&s;ons of the &s;ame or of different Quality. Among the&s;e Errors, there is none greater than that of the imperti|nent U&s;e of Title, and a paraphra&s;tical Way of &s;aying, You. I had the Curio&s;ity the other Day to follow a Crowd of People near <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> who were conducting a pa&s;&s;ionate Woman who &s;old Fi&s;h to a Magi&s;trate, in order to explain &s;ome Words which were ill taken by one of her own Quality and Profe&s;&s;ion in the publick Mar|ket. When &s;he came to make her Defence, &s;he was &s;o very full of, His Wor&s;hip, and of, If it &s;hould plea&s;e his Honour, that we could for &s;ome Time hardly hear any other Apology &s;he made for her &s;elf, than that of attoning for the ill Language &s;he had been accu&s;ed of towards her Neighbour by the great Civilities &s;he paid to her Judge. But this Extravagance in her Sen&s;e of doing Honour, was no more to be wondered at, than that her many
<PB N="66" REF="76">
Rings on each Finger were worn as In&s;tances of Finery and Dre&s;s. The Vulgar may thus heap and huddle Terms of Re&s;pect, and nothing bet|ter be expected from them; but for People of Rank to repeat Appellatives in&s;ignificantly, is a Folly not to be endured, neither with Regard to our Times or our Under&s;tanding. It is below the Dignity of Speech to extend it with more Words or Phra&s;es than are nece&s;&s;ary to explain our &s;elves with Elegance: And it is, methinks, an In&s;tance of Ignorance, if not of Servitude, to be redun|dant in &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I waited upon a Man of Quality &s;ome Morn|ings ago: He happened to be dre&s;&s;ing; and his Shoemaker fitting him, told him, That if his Lord&s;hip would plea&s;e to tread hard, or that if his Lord&s;hip would &s;tamp a little, his Lord&s;hip would find his Lord&s;hip's Shoe will fit as ea&s;ie as any Piece of Work his Lord&s;hip &s;hould &s;ee in <HI>England.</HI> As &s;oon as my Lord was dre&s;&s;ed, a Gentleman approached him with a very good Air, and told him, he had an Affair which had long depended in the Lower Courts, which, through the Inadvertency of his Ance|&s;tors on the one Side, and the ill Arts of their Ad|ver&s;aries on the other, could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;et|tled according to the Rules of the Lower Courts: That therefore he de&s;igned to bring his Cau&s;e be|fore the Hou&s;e of Lords next Se&s;&s;ion, where he &s;hould be glad if his Lord&s;hip &s;hould happen to be pre&s;ent; for he doubted not but his Cau&s;e would be approved by all Men of Ju&s;tice and Ho|nour. In this Place the Word Lord&s;hip was gracefully in&s;erted, becau&s;e it was applied to him in that Circum&s;tance wherein his Quality was the Occa&s;ion of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and wherein it was mo&s;t u&s;eful to the one, and mo&s;t honourable to the other.</P>
<P>This Way is &s;o far from being di&s;re&s;pectful to the Honour of Nobles, that it is an Expedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="67" REF="77">
for u&s;ing them with greater Deference. I would not put Lord&s;hip to a Man's Hat, Gloves, Wig, or Cane; but to de&s;ire his Lord&s;hip's Favour, his Lord&s;hip's Judgment, or his Lord&s;hip's Patro|nage, is a Manner of &s;peaking, which expre&s;&s;es an Alliance between his Quality and his Merit. It is this Knowledge which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Di&s;|cour&s;e of the Shoemaker from that of the Gen|tleman. The highe&s;t Point of good Breeding, if any one can hit it, is to &s;how a very nice Re|gard to your own Dignity, and with that in your Heart expre&s;s your Value for the Man above you.</P>
<P>But the &s;illy Humour to the contrary has &s;o much prevailed, that the &s;lavi&s;h Addition of Title enervates Di&s;cour&s;e, and renders the Appli|cation of it almo&s;t ridiculous. We Writers of Diurnals are nearer in our Styles to that of com|mon Talk than any other Writers, by which Means we u&s;e Words of Re&s;pect &s;ometimes very unfortunately. The <HI>Po&s;t-Man,</HI> who is one of the mo&s;t celebrated of our Fraternity, fell into this Misfortune Ye&s;terday in his Paragraph from <HI>Ber|lin</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 26. <HI>Count</HI> Wartemberg (&s;ays he) <HI>Great Chamberlain, and Chief Mini&s;ter of this Court, who on</HI> Monday <HI>le&s;t accompanied the King of</HI> Pru&s;&s;ia <HI>to</HI> Oranienburg, <HI>was taken &s;o very ill, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Wedne&s;day <HI>has Life was de&s;paired of; and we had a Report, that his Excellency was dead.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly pre&s;ume, that it &s;lattens the Narra|tion, to &s;ay his Excellency in a Ca&s;e which is common to all Men; except you would infer what is not to be inferred, to wit, That the Author de&s;igned to &s;ay, All wherein he excelled others was departed from him.</P>
<P>Were Di&s;tinctions u&s;ed according to the Rules of Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e, tho&s;e Additions to Men's Names would be, as they were fir&s;t intended, &s;ig|nificant of their Worth, and not their Per&s;ons; &s;o that in &s;ome Ca&s;es it might be proper to &s;ay,
<PB N="68" REF="78">
The Man is dead, but his Excellency will never die. It is, methinks, very unju&s;t to laugh at a Quaker, becau&s;e he has taken up a Re&s;olution to treat you with a Word, the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of Complai&s;ance that can be thought of, and with an Air of good Nature and Charity calls you Friend. I &s;ay, it is very unju&s;t to rally him for this Term to a Stranger, when you your &s;elves, in all your Phra&s;es of Di&s;tinction, confound Phra&s;es of Honour into no U&s;e at all.</P>
<P><HI>Tom.

<P>NAture has implanted in us Two very &s;trong De&s;ires, Hunger for the Pre&s;ervation of the Individual, and Lu&s;t for the Support of the Spe|cies; or, to &s;peak more intelligibly, the former to continue our own Per&s;ons, and the latter to in|troduce others into the World. According as Men behave them&s;elves with regard to the&s;e Ap|petites, they are above or below the Bea&s;ts of the Field, which are incited by them without Choice or Reflection. But rea&s;onable Creatures correct the&s;e Incentives, and improve them into elegant Motives of Friend&s;hip and Society. It is chiefly from this homely Foundation, that we are under the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking for the agreeable Companion, and the honourable Mi&s;tre&s;s. By this Cultivation of Art and Rea&s;on, our Wants are made Plea&s;ures, and the Gratification of our De&s;ires, under proper Re&s;trictions, a Work no Way below our noble&s;t Faculties. The wi&s;e&s;t Man may maintain his Character, and yet con&s;i|der in what Manner he &s;hall be&s;t entertain his Friend, or divert his Mi&s;tre&s;s: Nay, it is &s;o far from being a Derogation to him, that he can in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o other In&s;tances &s;how &s;o true a Ta&s;t of his Life, or his Fortune.

The next ab&s;urd Way of enjoying our &s;elves at Meals, is, where the Bottle is ply'd without being called for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> where Humour takes Place of Appetite, and the good Company are too dull or too merry to know any Enjoyment in their Sen&s;es.</P>

Way is &s;omewhat unaccountable; and placing much Thought either in too great Sumptuou&s;ne&s;s and Elegance in this Matter, or wallowing in Noi&s;e and Riot at it, are both, tho' not equally, unaccountable. I have often con&s;idered the&s;e dif|ferent People with very great Attention, and al|ways &s;peak of them with the Di&s;tinction of the Eaters, and the Swallowers. The Eaters &s;acri|fice all their Sen&s;es and Under&s;tanding to this Ap|petite: The Swallowers hurry them&s;elves out of both, without plea&s;ing this or any other Appetite at all. The latter are improved Brutes, the for|mer degenerated Men. I have &s;ometimes thought it would not be improper to add to my Dead and Living Men, Per&s;ons in an intermediate State of Humanity, under the Appellation of Dozers. The Dozers are a Sect, who, in&s;tead of keeping their Appetites in Subjection, live in Subjection to them; nay, they are &s;o truly Slaves to them, that they keep at too great a Di&s;tance ever to come into their Pre&s;ence. Within my own Acquain|tance, I know tho&s;e that I dare &s;ay have forgot that they ever were hungry, and are no le&s;s utter Strangers to Thir&s;t and Wearine&s;s, who are be|holden to Sauces for their Food, and to their Food for their Wearine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have often wondered, confidering the excel|lent and choice Spirits that we have among our Divines, that they do not think of putting vici|ous Habits into a more contemptible and unlove|ly Figure than they do at pre&s;ent. So many Men of Wit and Spirit as there are in Sacred Orders, have it in their Power to make the Fa&s;hion of their Side. The Leaders in humane Society are more effectu|ally prevailed upon this Way than can ea&s;ily be imagined. I have more than one in my Thoughts at this Time capable of doing this again&s;t all the Oppo&s;ition of the mo&s;t Witty, as well as the mo&s;t Voluptuous. There may po&s;&s;ibly be more ac|ceptable Subjects, but &s;ure there are none more
<PB N="72" REF="82">
u&s;eful. It is vi&s;ible, that tho' Mens Fortunes, Circum&s;tances, and Plea&s;ures, give them Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions too &s;trong to regard any Mention ei|ther of Puni&s;hments or Rewards, they will li&s;ten to what makes them incon&s;iderable or mean in the Imaginations of others, and by Degrees in their own.</P>
<P>It is certain &s;uch Topicks are to be touched up|on in the Light we mean, only by Men of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Prudence, as well as excellent Wit: For the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es are to be made, if made to run into Example, before &s;uch as have their Thoughts more intent upon the Propriety than the Rea&s;on of the Di&s;cour&s;e. What indeed leads me into this Way of Thinking, is, That the la&s;t Thing I read was a Sermon of the learn|ed Dr. <HI>South,</HI> upon <HI>the Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s.</HI> This admirable Di&s;cour&s;e was made at Court, where the Preacher was too wi&s;e a Man not to believe, the greate&s;t Argument, in that Place, again&s;t the Plea&s;ures then in Vogue, mu&s;t be, that they lo&s;t greater Plea&s;ures by pro&s;ecuting the Cour&s;e they were in. The Charming Di&s;cour&s;e has in it whatever Wit and Wi&s;dom can put together. This Gentleman has a Talent of making all his Faculties bear to the great End of his hallowed Profe&s;&s;ion. Happy Genius! He is the better Man for being a Wit. The be&s;t Way to prai&s;e this Author is to quote him; and, I think, I may de|fy any Man to &s;ay a greater Thing of him, or his Ability, than that there are no Paragraphs in the whole Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;peak of below the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>After having recommended the Satisfaction of the Mind, and the Plea&s;ure of Con&s;cience, he proceeds:</P>
<Q><P>An ennobling Property of it is, That it is &s;uch a Plea&s;ure as never &s;atiates or wearies; for it properly affects the Spirit, and a Spirit feels no Wearine&s;s, as being privileged from the
<PB N="73" REF="83">
Cau&s;es of it. But can the Epicure &s;ay &s;o of any of the Plea&s;ures he &s;o much dotes upon? Do they not expire while they &s;atisfy, and after a few Minutes Refre&s;hment determine in Loath|ing and Unquietne&s;s? How &s;hort is the Inter|val between a Plea&s;ure and a Burthen? How undi&s;cernable the Tran&s;ition from one to the o|ther: Plea&s;ure dwells no longer upon the Ap|petie than the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature, which are quickly and ea&s;ily provided for; and then all that follows is a Load and an Oppre&s;&s;ion. Every Mor&s;el to a &s;atisfied Hunger, is only a new Labour to a tired Dige&s;tion. Every Draught to him that has quenched his Thir&s;t, is but a further quenching of Nature, and a Provi&s;ion for Rheum and Di&s;ea&s;es, a Drowning of the Quickne&s;s and Activity of the Spirits.</P>
<P>He that prolongs his Meals, and &s;acrifices his Time, as well as his other Conveniencies, to his Luxury, How quickly does he out&s;it his Plea|&s;ure? And then, How is all the following Time be&s;towed upon Ceremony and Surfeit? Till at length, after a long Fatigue of Eating, and Drinking, and Babbling, he concludes the great Work of dining genteely, and &s;o makes a Shift to ri&s;e from Table, that he may lie down upon his Bed; where, after he has &s;lept him&s;elf into &s;ome U&s;e of him&s;elf, by much ado he &s;taggers to his Table again, and there acts over the &s;ame bruti&s;h Scene: So that he pa&s;&s;es his whole Life in a dozed Condition, between &s;leeping and waking, with a Kind of Drow&s;ine&s;s and Con|fu&s;ion upon his Sen&s;es, which, what Plea&s;ure it can be, is hard to conceive. All that is of it dwells upon the Tip of his Tongue, and within the Compa&s;s of his Palate. A worthy Prize for a Man to purcha&s;e with the Lo&s;s of his Time, his Rea&s;on, and him&s;elf!</P></Q>

Words and Actions tend to the Advancement of his Reputation and of his Fortune, toward which he makes hourly Progre&s;s, becau&s;e he lavi&s;hes no Part of his good Will upon &s;uch as do not make &s;ome Advances to merit it. The Man who va|lues Affection, &s;ometimes becomes popular; he who aims at E&s;teem, &s;eldom falls of growing rich.</P>
<P>Thus far we have looked at the&s;e different Men, as Per&s;ons who endeavour to be valued and be|loved from De&s;ign, or Ambition; but they ap|pear in quite another Figure, when you ob&s;erve the Men who are agreeable and venerable from the Force of their natural Inclinations. We af|fect the Company of him who has lea&s;t Regard of him&s;elf in his Carriage, who throws him&s;elf into unguarded Gaiety, voluntary Mirth, and ge|neral good Humour; who has nothing in his Head but the pre&s;ent Hour, and &s;eems to have all his Intere&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions gratified, if every Man el&s;e in the Room is as unconcerned as him&s;elf. This Man u&s;ually has no Quality or Character among his Companions, let him be born of whom he will, have what great Qualities he plea&s;e, let him be capable of a&s;&s;uming for a Moment what Figures he plea&s;es, he &s;till dwells in the Ima|gination of all who know him but as <HI>Jack &s;uch a One.</HI> This makes <HI>Jack</HI> brighten up the Room wherever he enters, and change the Severity of the Company into that Gaiety and good Humour into which his Conver&s;ation generally leads them. It is not unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve even this Sort of Creature go out of his Character, to check him&s;elf &s;ometimes for his Familiarities, and pretend &s;o aukwardly at procuring to him|&s;elf more e&s;teem than he finds he meets with. I was the other Day walking with <HI>Jack Gainly</HI> to|wards <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Walks.</HI> We met a Fellow who is a Lower Officer where <HI>Jack</HI> is in the Di|rection. <HI>Jack</HI> cries to him, So, How is it Mr &mdash;

I went on, and told him, Look'ee, <HI>Jack,</HI> I have heard thee &s;ometimes talk like an Oracle for half an Hour, with the Sentiments of a <HI>Roman,</HI> the Clo&s;ene&s;s of a School-man, and the Integrity of a Divine; but then, <HI>Jack,</HI> while I admired thee, it was upon Topicks which did not concern thy &s;elf, and where the Greatne&s;s of the Subject, (ad|ded to thy being per&s;onally unconcerned in it) created all that was great in thy Di&s;cour&s;e. I did not mind his being a little out of Humour, but comforted him, by giving him &s;everal In&s;tances of Men of our Acquaintance, who had no one Quality in any Eminence, that were much more e&s;teemed than he was with very many: But the Thing is, if your Character is to give Plea&s;ure, Men will con&s;ider you only in that Light, and not in tho&s;e Acts which turn to E&s;teem and Ve|neration.</P>
<P>When I think of <HI>Jack Gainly,</HI> I cannot but re|flect al&s;o upon his Si&s;ter <HI>Gatty.</HI> She is young, witty, plea&s;ant, innocent. This is her natural Character; but when &s;he ob&s;erves any one ad|mired for what they call a Fine Woman, &s;he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the next Day womanly, prudent, ob&s;erving, and virtuous.

of Humour, and &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'It would be very well, if &s;ome People would examine into them&s;elves as much as they do into others.'</Q> Or, <Q REND="inline">'Sure there is nothing in the World &s;o ridiculous as an amorous old Man.'</Q></P>
<P>As I was &s;aying, there is a Cla&s;s which every Man is in by his Po&s;t in Nature, from which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to withdraw to another, and become it. Therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that each &s;hould be contented with it, and not endeavour at any Progre&s;s out of that Tract. To follow Na|ture, is the only agreeable Cour&s;e; which is what I would fain inculcate to tho&s;e jarring Compa|nions, <HI>Flavia</HI> and <HI>Lucia.</HI> They are Mother and Daughter. <HI>Flavia,</HI> who is the Mamma, has all the Charms and De&s;ires of Youth &s;till about her, and not much turned of Thirty: <HI>Lucia</HI> is bloom|ing and amorous, and but a little above Fifteen. The Mother looks very much younger than &s;he is, the Girl very much elder. If it were po&s;&s;ible to fix the Girl to her &s;ick Bed, and pre&s;erve the Portion (the U&s;e of which the Mother partakes) the good Widow <HI>Flavia</HI> would certainly do it. But for fear of <HI>Lucia</HI>'s E&s;cape, the Mother is for|ced to be con&s;tantly attended with a Rival, that explains her Age, and draws off the Eyes of her Admirers. The Je&s;t is, they can never be toge|ther in Strangers Company, but <HI>Lucy</HI> is eternally reprimanded for &s;omething very particular in her Behaviour; for which &s;he has the Malice to &s;ay, She hopes &s;he &s;hall always obey her Parents. She carried her Pa&s;&s;ion and Jealou&s;y to that Height the other Day, that coming &s;uddenly into the Room, and &s;urpri&s;ing Colonel <HI>Lofty</HI> &s;peaking Rapture on one Knee to her Mother, &s;he clapped down by him, and asked her Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I do not know whether it is &s;o proper to tell Family Occurrences of this Nature; but we eve|ry Day &s;ee the &s;ame Thing happen in the publick Conver&s;ation in the World. Men cannot be con|tented
<PB N="78" REF="88">
with what is laudable, but they mu&s;t have all that is laudable. This Affectation is what de|&s;troys the familiar Man into Pretences to take State upon him, and the contrary Character to the Folly of aiming at being winning and com|plai&s;ant. But in the&s;e Ca&s;es, Men may ea&s;ily lay a&s;ide what they are, but can never arrive at what they are not.</P>
<P>As to the Pur&s;uits after Affection and E&s;teem, the Fair Sex are happy in this Particular, that with them the one is much more nearly related to the other than in Men. The Love of a Wo|man is in&s;eparable from &s;ome E&s;teem of her; and as &s;he is naturally the Object of Affection, the Woman who has your E&s;teem has al&s;o &s;ome Degree of your Love. A Man that dotes on a Woman for her Beauty, will whi&s;per his Friend, <HI>That Creature has a great deal of Wit when you are well acquainted with her.</HI> And if you examine the Bottom of your E&s;teem for a Woman, you will find you have a greater Opinion of her Beau|ty than any Body el&s;e.

<P>HAving Ye&s;terday Morning received a Paper of <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es, written with much Ele|gance in Honour of the&s;e my Papers, and being informed at the &s;ame Time that they were com|po&s;ed by a Youth under Age, I read them with
<PB N="79" REF="89">
much Delight, as an In&s;tance of his Improve|ment. There is not a greater Plea&s;ure to old Age, than &s;eeing young People entertain them&s;elves in &s;uch a Manner as that we can partake of their Enjoyments. On &s;uch Occa&s;ions we flatter our &s;elves, that we are not quite laid a&s;ide in the World, but that we are either u&s;ed with Grati|tude for what we were, or honoured for what we are. A well inclined young Man, and who&s;e good Breeding is founded upon the Principles of Nature and Virtue, mu&s;t needs take Delight in being agreeable to his Elders, as we are truly de|lighted when we are not the Je&s;t of them. When I &s;ay this, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot but think it a very lamentable Thing that there &s;hould be a Nece&s;&s;ity for making that a Rule of Life, which &s;hould be, methinks, a meer In&s;tinct of Nature. If Reflection upon a Man in Poverty, whom we once knew in Riches, is an Argument of Commi|&s;eration with generous Minds; &s;ure old Age, which is a Decay from that Vigour which the Young po&s;&s;e&s;s, and mu&s;t certainly (if not pre|vented again&s;t their Will) arrive at, &s;hould be more forcibly the Object of that Reverence which hone&s;t Spirits are inclined to from a Sen&s;e of be|ing them&s;elves liable to what they ob&s;erve has al|ready overtaken others.</P>
<P>My Three Nephews, whom in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t was Twelvemonth I di&s;po&s;ed of according to their &s;e|veral Capacities and Inclinations, the fir&s;t to the Univer&s;ity, the Second to a Merchant, and the Third to a Woman of Quality as her Page, by my Invitation dined with me to Day. It is my Cu|&s;tom often, when I have a Mind to give my &s;elf a more than ordinary Chearfulne&s;s, to invite a certain young Gentlewoman of our Neighbour|hood to make one of the Company. She did me that Favour this Day. The Pre&s;ence of a beauti|ful Woman of Honour, to Minds which are not trivially di&s;po&s;ed, di&s;plays an Alacrity which is
<PB N="80" REF="90">
not to be communicated by any other Object. It was not unplea&s;ant to me to look into her Thoughts of the Company &s;he was in. She &s;miled at the Party of Plea&s;ure I had thought of for her, which was compo&s;ed of an old Man and Three Boys. My Scholar, my Citizen, and my &s;elf, were very &s;oon neglected; and the young Courtier, by the Bow he made to her at her En|trance, engaged her Ob&s;ervation without a Rival. I ob&s;erved the <HI>Oxonian</HI> not a little di&s;compo&s;ed at this Preference, while the Trader kept his Eye upon his Unkle. My Nephew <HI>Will</HI> had a Thou|&s;and &s;ecret Re&s;olutions to break in upon the Di&s;|cour&s;e of his younger Brother, who gave my fair Companion a full Account of the Fa&s;hion, and what was reckoned mo&s;t becoming to this Com|plexion, and what Sort of Habit appeared be&s;t upon t'other Shape. He proceeded to acquaint her, who of Quality was well or &s;ick within the Bills of Mortality, and named very familiarly all his Lady's Acquaintance, not forgetting her very Words when he &s;poke of their Characters. Be|&s;ides all this, he had a Road of Flattery; and up|on her enquiring what Sort of Woman Lady <HI>Love|ly</HI> was in her Per&s;on, Really Madam, &s;ays the Jackanapes, &s;he is exactly of your Height and Shape; but as you are fair, &s;he is a brown Wo|man. There was no enduring that this Fop &s;hould out&s;hine us all at this unmerciful Rate, therefore I thought fit to talk to my young Scho|lar concerning his Studies; and becau&s;e I would throw his Learning into pre&s;ent Service, I de&s;ired him to repeat to me the Tran&s;lation he had made of &s;ome tender Ver&s;es in <HI>Theocritus.</HI> He did &s;o, with an Air of Elegance peculiar to the College to which I &s;ent him. I made &s;ome Exceptions to the Turn of the Phra&s;es, which he defended with much Mode&s;ty, as believing in that Place the Matter was rather to con&s;ult the Softne&s;s of a Swain's Pa&s;&s;ion, than the Strength of his Expre&s;|&s;ions.
<PB N="81" REF="91">
It &s;oon appeared, that <HI>Will</HI> had out-&s;trip|ped his Brother in the Opinion of our young La|dy. A little Poetry to one who is bred a Scholar, has the &s;ame Effect that a good Carriage of his Per&s;on has on one who is to live in Courts. The Favour of Women is &s;o natural a Pa&s;&s;ion, that I envied both the Boys their Succe&s;s in the Appro|bation of my Gue&s;t; and I thought the only Per|&s;on invulnerable was my young Trader. During the whole Meal, I could ob&s;erve in the Children a mutual Contempt and Scorn of each other, ari|&s;ing from their different Way of Life and Educa|tion, and took that Occa&s;ion to adverti&s;e them of &s;uch growing Di&s;ta&s;ts, which might mi&s;lead them in their future Life, and di&s;appoint their Friends, as well as them&s;elves, of the Advantages which might be expected from the Diver&s;ity of their Profe&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Prejudices which are growing up between the&s;e Brothers from the different Ways of Edu|cation, are what create the mo&s;t fatal Mi&s;under|&s;tandings in Life. But all Di&s;tinctions of Di&s;pa|ragement meerly from our Circum&s;tances, are &s;uch as will not bear the Examination of Rea&s;on. The Courtier, the Trader, and the Scholar, &s;hould all have an equal Preten&s;ion to the Deno|mination of a Gentleman. That Trade&s;man who deals with me in a Commodity which I do not under&s;tand with Uprightne&s;s, has much more Right to that Character, than the Courtier who gives me fal&s;e Hopes, or the Scholar who laughs at my Ignorance.</P>
<P>The Appellation of Gentleman is never to be affixed to a Man's Circum&s;tances, but to his Be|haviour in them.

<P>I Have yours, with Notice of a Benefit-Ticket of 400 <HI>l. per Annum, both enclo&s;ed by</HI> Mr. <HI>El|liot,</HI> who had my Numbers for that Purpo&s;e. Your Philo&s;ophick Advice came very &s;ea&s;onably to me with that good Fortune; but I mu&s;t be &s;o &s;incere with you as to acknowledge, I owe my pre&s;ent Moderation more to my own Folly, than your wi&s;dom.

I hope my pre&s;ent State of Mind will grow in|to that; but I confe&s;s my Conduct to be now owing to another Cau&s;e.

<P>AN old Acquaintanc who met me this Morn|ing &s;eemed overjoyed to &s;ee me, and told me, I looked as well as he had known me do the&s;e Forty Years: But, continued he, not quite the Man you were when we vi&s;ited together at Lady <HI>Brightly</HI>'s. Oh! <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> tho&s;e Days are over. Do you think there are any &s;uch fine Creatures now living as we then conver&s;ed with? He went on with a Thou&s;and incoherent Circum&s;tances, which, in his Imagination, mu&s;t needs plea&s;e me; but they had the quite contrary Effect. The Flat|tery with which he began, in telling me how well I wore, was not di&s;agreeable; but his indi&s;creet Mention of a Set of Acquaintance we had out|lived, recalled Ten Thou&s;and Things to my Me|mory, which made me reflect upon my pre&s;ent Condition with Regret. Had he indeed been &s;o kind as, after a long Ab&s;ence, to felicitate me up|on an indolent and ea&s;y old Age, and mentioned how much he and I had to thank for, who at our Time of Day could walk firmly, eat heartily, and conver&s;e chearfully, he had kept up my Plea&s;ure in my &s;elf. But of all Mankind, there are none &s;o &s;hocking as the&s;e injudicious civil People. They ordinarily begin upon &s;omething that they know mu&s;t be a Satisfaction; but then, for Fear of the Imputation of Flattery, they follow it with the la&s;t Thing in the World of which you would be
<PB N="84" REF="94">
reminded. It is this that perplexes civil Per&s;ons. The Rea&s;on that there is &s;uch a general Outcry among&s;t us again&s;t Flatterers, is, that there are &s;o very few good Ones. It is the nice&s;t Art in this Life, and is a Part of Eloquence which does not want the Preparation that is nece&s;&s;ary to all other Parts of it, That your Audience &s;hould be your Well-wi&s;hers: For Prai&s;e from an Enemy is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all Commendations.</P>
<P>It is generally to be ob&s;erved, that the Per&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to a Man for a Con&s;tancy is he that has no &s;hining Qualities, but is a certain Degree above great Imperfections, whom he can live with as his Inferior, and who will either overlook or not ob&s;erve his little Defects. Such an ea&s;y Com|panion as this, either now and then throws out a little Flattery, or lets a Man &s;ilently flatter him|&s;elf in his Superiority to him. If you take No|tice, there is hardly a rich Man in the World, who has not &s;uch a led Friend of &s;mall Con&s;idera|tion, who is a Darling for his In&s;ignificancy. It is a great Ea&s;e to have one in our own Shape a Species below us, and who, without being li&s;ted in our Service, is by Nature of our Retinue. The&s;e Dependants are of excellent U&s;e on a Rainy Day, or when a Man has not a Mind to dre&s;s, or to ex|clude Solitude, when one has neither a Mind to that or to Company. There are of this good-na|tured Order, who are &s;o kind as to divide them|&s;elves, and do the&s;e good Offices to many. Five or Six of them vi&s;it a whole Quarter of the Town, and exclude the Spleen without Fees from the Families they frequent. If they do not pre&s;cribe Phy&s;ick, they can be Company when you take it. Very great Benefactors to the Rich, or tho&s;e whom they call People at their Ea&s;e, are your Per&s;ons of no Con&s;equence. I have known &s;ome of them, by the Help of a little Cunning, make delicious Flatterers. They know the Cour&s;e of the Town, and the general Characters of Per&s;ons: By this
<PB N="85" REF="95">
Means they will &s;ometimes tell the mo&s;t agree|able Fal&s;hoods imaginable. They will acquaint you, that &s;uch a One of a quite contrary Party &s;aid, that tho' you were engaged in different In|tere&s;ts, yet he had the greate&s;t Re&s;pect for your good Sen&s;e and Addre&s;s. When one of the&s;e has a little Cunning, he pa&s;&s;es his Time in the ut|mo&s;t Satisfaction to him&s;elf and his Friends: For his Po&s;ition is never to report or &s;peak a di&s;plea|&s;ing Thing to his Friend. As for letting him go on in an Error, he knows Advice again&s;t them is the Office of Per&s;ons of greater Talents and le&s;s Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> Word for a Flatterer <HI>(A&s;&s;entator)</HI> implies no more than a Per&s;on that barely con|&s;ents; and indeed &s;uch a one, if a Man were able to purcha&s;e or maintain him, cannot be bought too dear. Such a one never contradicts you, but gains upon you, not by a ful&s;om Way of com|mending you in broad Terms, but liking what|ever you propo&s;e or utter; at the &s;ame Time is ready to beg your Pardon, and gain&s;ay you, if you chance to &s;peak Ill of your &s;elf. An old Lady is very &s;eldom without &s;uch a Companion as this, who can recite the Names of all her Lovers, and the Matches refu&s;ed by her in the Days when &s;he minded &s;uch Vanities, (as &s;he is plea&s;ed to call them, tho' &s;he &s;o much approves the Mention of them.) It is to be noted, that a Woman's Flatterer is generally older than her &s;elf, her Years &s;erving at once to recommend her Patrone&s;s's Age, and to add Weight to her Complai&s;ance in all other Particulars.</P>
<P>We Gentlemen of &s;mall Fortunes are extreme|ly nece&s;&s;itous in this Particular. I have indeed one who &s;mokes with me often; but his Parts are &s;o low, that all the Incen&s;e he does me is to fill his Pipe with me, and to be out at ju&s;t as many Whiffs as I take. This is all the Prai&s;e or A&s;&s;ent that he is capable of, yet there are more Hours when I
<PB N="86" REF="96">
would rather be in his Company than that of the brighte&s;t Man I know. It would be an hard Mat|ter to give an Account of this Inclination to be flattered; but if we go to the Bottom of it, we &s;hall find that the Plea&s;ure in it is &s;omething like that of receiving Money which lay out. Every Man thinks he has an E&s;tate of Reputation, and is glad to &s;ee one that will bring any of it Home to him: It is no Matter how dirty a Bag it is con|veyed to him in, or by how clowni&s;h a Me&s;&s;enger, &s;o the Money is good. All that we want to be plea&s;ed with Flattery, is to believe that the Man is &s;incere who gives it us. It is by this one Ac|cident, that ab&s;urd Creatures often outrun the more Skilful in this Art. Their Want of Ability is here an Advantage, and their Bluntne&s;s, as it is the &s;eeming Effect of Sincerity, is the be&s;t Co|ver to Artifice.</P>
<P><HI>Terence</HI> introduces a Flatterer talking to a Cox|comb whom he cheats out of a Livelihood, and a third Per&s;on on the Stage makes on him this plea|&s;ant Remark, <Q REND="inline">"This Fellow has an Art of making Fools Madmen."</Q> The Love of Flattery is in|deed &s;ometimes the Weakne&s;s of a great Mind; but you &s;ee it al&s;o in Per&s;ons who otherwi&s;e di&s;|cover no Manner of Reli&s;h of any Thing above meer Sen&s;uality. The&s;e latter it &s;ometimes im|proves, but always deba&s;es the former. A Fool is in him&s;elf the Object of Pity till he is flattered. By the Force of that his Stupidity is rai&s;ed into Affectation, and he becomes of Dignity enough to be ridiculous. I remember a Drole, that upon one's &s;aying, The Times are &s;o tickli&s;h that there mu&s;t great Care be taken what one &s;ays in Con|ver&s;ation; an&s;wered with an Air of Surline&s;s and Hone&s;ty, If People will be free, let them be &s;o in the Manner that I am, who never abu&s;e a Man but to his Face. He had no Reputation for &s;ay|ing dangerous Truths; therefore when it was re|peated, You abu&s;e a Man but to his Face? Yes, &s;ays he, I flatter him.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97">
It is indeed the greate&s;t of Injuries to flatter any but the Unhappy, or &s;uch as are di&s;plea&s;ed with them&s;elves for &s;ome Infirmity. In this latter Ca&s;e we have a Member of our Club, that when Sir <HI>Jeffery</HI> falls a&s;leep, wakens him with Snoring. This makes Sir <HI>Jeffery</HI> hold up for &s;ome Moments the longer, to &s;ee there are Men younger than him&s;elf among us, who are more Lethargick than he is.</P>
<P>When Flattery is practi&s;ed upon any other Con|&s;ideration, it is the mo&s;t abject Thing in Nature; nay, I cannot think of any Character below the Flatterer, except he that envies him. You meet with Fellows prepared to be as mean as po&s;&s;ible in their Conde&s;centions and Expre&s;&s;ions; but they want Per&s;ons and Talents to ri&s;e up to &s;uch a Ba&s;e|ne&s;s. As a Coxcomb is a Fool of Parts, &s;o is a Flatterer a Knave of Parts.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of this Order that I know, is one who di&s;gui&s;es it under a Spirit of Contradiction or Re|proof. He told an errant Driveler the other Day, That he did not care for being in Company with him, becau&s;e he heard he turned his ab&s;ent Friends into Ridicule. And upon Lady <HI>Autumn</HI>'s di&s;pu|ting with him about &s;omething that happened at the Revolution, he replied with a very angry Tone, Pray, Madam, give me Leave to know more of a Thing in which I was actually con|cerned, than you who were then in your Nur&s;e's Arms.</P>

<P>ANoble Painter, who has an Ambition to draw an Hi&s;tory-Piece, has de&s;ired of me to give him a Subject on which he may &s;how the utmo&s;t Force of his Art and Genius. For this Purpo&s;e I have pitched upon that remarkable Incident be|tween <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> and his Phy&s;ician. This Prince, in the Mid&s;t of his Conque&s;ts in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> was &s;eized by a violent Fever; and according to the Account we have of his <HI>va&s;t</HI> Mind, his Thoughts were more employed about his Recovery as it regarded the War, than as it concerned his own Life. He profe&s;&s;ed, a &s;low Method was wor&s;e than Death to him, becau&s;e it was what he more dreaded, an Interruption of his Glory. He de&s;i|red a dangerous, &s;o it might be a &s;peedy Reme|dy. During this Impatience of the King, it is well known that <HI>Darius</HI> had offered an immen&s;e Sum to any who &s;hould take away his Life. But <HI>Philippus,</HI> the mo&s;t e&s;teemed and mo&s;t knowing of his Phy&s;icians, promi&s;ed, that within Three Days Time he would prepare a Medicine for him which &s;hould re&s;tore him more expeditiou&s;ly than could be imagined. Immediately after this En|gagement, <HI>Alexander</HI> receives a Letter from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Captains, with Intelli|gence, That <HI>Darius</HI> had bribed <HI>Philippus</HI> to poi|&s;on him. Every Circum&s;tance imaginable favou|red this Su&s;picion; but this Monarch, who did nothing but in an extraordinary Manner, conceal|ed the Letter; and while the Medicine was pre|paring, &s;pent all his Thoughts upon his Behaviour
<PB N="89" REF="99">
in this important Incident. From his long Soli|loquy he came to this Re&s;olution: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Alexander</HI> mu&s;t not lie here alive to be oppre&s;&s;ed by his Enemy. I will not believe my Phy&s;ician guilty; or, I will peri&s;h rather by his Guilt, than my own Diffidence.'</Q></P>
<P>At the appointed Hour, <HI>Philippus</HI> enters with the Potion. One cannot but form to one's &s;elf on Occa&s;ion the Encounter of their Eyes, the Re&s;olu|tion in tho&s;e of the Patient, and the Benevolence in the Countenance of the Phy&s;ician. The Hero rai&s;ed him&s;elf in his Bed, and holding the Letter in one Hand, and the Potion in the other, drank the Medicine. It will exerci&s;e my Friend's Pencil and Brain to place this Action in its proper Beauty. A Prince ob&s;erving the Features of a &s;u&s;pected Traytor after having drank the Poi&s;on he offer'd him, is a Circum&s;tance &s;o full of Pa&s;&s;ion, that it will require the highe&s;t Strength of his Imagina|tion to conceive it, much more to expre&s;s it. But as Painting is Eloquence and Poetry in Mecha|ni&s;m, I &s;hall rai&s;e his Idea's, by reading with him the fine&s;t Draughts of the Pa&s;&s;ions concerned in this Circum&s;tance from the mo&s;t excellent Poets and Orators. The Confidence which <HI>Alexander</HI> a&s;&s;umes from the Air of <HI>Philippus</HI>'s Face as he is reading his Accu&s;ation, and the generous Di&s;dain which is to ri&s;e in the Features of a fal&s;ly accu&s;ed Man, are principally to be regarded. In this Par|ticular he mu&s;t heighten his Thoughts, by reflect|ing, that he is not drawing only an innocent Man traduced, but a Man zealou&s;ly affected to his Per|&s;on and Safety, full of Re&s;entment for being thought fal&s;e. How &s;hall we contrive to expre&s;s the highe&s;t Admiration mingled with Di&s;dain? How &s;hall we in Strokes of a Pencil &s;ay, what <HI>Philippus</HI> did to his Prince on this Occa&s;ion? <Q REND="inline">"Sir, my Life never depended on yours more than it does now. Without knowing this Secret, I prepared the Potion, which you have taken as
<PB N="90" REF="100">
what concerned <HI>Philippus</HI> no le&s;s than <HI>Alexander;</HI> and there is nothing new in this Adventure, but that it makes me &s;till more admire the Genero&s;ity and Confidence of my Ma&s;ter."</Q> <HI>Alexander</HI> took him by the Hand, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Philippus,</HI> I am con|fident you had rather I had any other Way to have manife&s;ted the Faith I have in you, than a Ca&s;e which &s;o nearly concerns me: And in Gra|titude I now a&s;&s;ure you, I am anxious for the Effect of your Medicine, more for your Sake than my own.'</Q></P>
<P>My Painter is employed by a Man of Sen&s;e and Wealth to furni&s;h him a Gallery, and I &s;hall join with my Friend in the De&s;igning Part. It is the great U&s;e of Pictures to rai&s;e in our Minds either agreeable Idea's of our ab&s;ent Friends, or high Images of eminent Per&s;onages. But the latter De|&s;ign is, methinks, carried on in a very improper Way: For to fill a Room full of Battle-Pieces, pompous Hi&s;tories of Sieges, and a tall Hero a|lone in a Crowd of in&s;ignificant Figures about him, is of no Con&s;equence to private Men. But to place before our Eyes great and illu&s;trious Men in tho&s;e Parts and Circum&s;tances of Life wherein their Behaviour may have an Effect upon our Minds, as being &s;uch as we partake with them merely as they were Men: Such as the&s;e, I &s;ay, may be ju&s;t and u&s;eful Ornaments of an elegant Apartment. In this Collection therefore that we are making, we will not have the Battles, but the Sentiments of <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Affair we were ju&s;t now talking of, has Circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t Nature, and yet their Grandeur has little to do with his Fortune. If by ob&s;erving &s;uch a Piece as that of his taking a Bowl of Poi&s;on with &s;o much Magnanimity, a Man, the next Time he has a Fit of the Spleen, is le&s;s froward to his Friend or his Servants; thus far is &s;ome Improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="101">
I have frequently thought, that if we had many Draughts which were Hi&s;torical of certain Pa&s;&s;ions, and had the true Figure of the great Men we &s;ee tran&s;ported by them, it would be of the mo&s;t &s;olid Advantage imaginable. To con&s;ider this mighty Man on one Occa&s;ion admini&s;ter to the Wants of a poor Soldier, benummed with Cold, with the greate&s;t Humanity; at another, barbarou&s;ly &s;tab|bing a faithful Officer: At one Time, &s;o gene|rou&s;ly cha&s;t and virtuous as to give his Captive <HI>Statira</HI> her Liberty; at another, burning a Town at the In&s;tigation of <HI>Thais.</HI> This Sort of Changes in the &s;ame Per&s;on are what would be more bene|ficial Le&s;&s;ons of Morality, than the &s;everal Revo|lutions in a great Man's Fortune. There are but One or Two in an Age to whom the pompous In|cidents of his Life can be exemplary; but I or any Man may be as &s;ick, as good-natur'd, as compa&s;&s;io|nate, and as angry, as <HI>Alexander the great.</HI> My Purpo&s;e in all this Chat is, that &s;o excellent a Fur|niture may not for the future have &s;o Romantick a Turn, but allude to Incidents which come with|in the Fortunes of the ordinary Race of Men. I do not know but 'tis by the Force of this &s;en&s;ele&s;s Cu&s;tom that People are drawn in Po&s;tures they would not for half they are worth be &s;urpri&s;ed in. The unparallell'd Fircene&s;s of &s;ome Rural 'Squires drawn in Red, or in Armour, who never dreamed to de&s;troy any Thing above a Fox, is a common and ordinary Offence of this Kind. But I &s;hall give an Account of our whole Gallery on another Occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>I Did my &s;elf the Honour this Day to make a Vi&s;it to a Lady of Quality, who is one of tho&s;e who are ever railing at the Vices of the Age, but mean only one Vice, becau&s;e it is the only Vice they are not guilty of. She went &s;o far as to fall foul on a young Woman who has had Imputa|tions; but whether they were ju&s;t or not, no one knows but her &s;elf. However that is, &s;he is in her pre&s;ent Behaviour mode&s;t, humble, pious, and di&s;creet. I thought it became me to bring this cen|&s;orious Lady to Rea&s;on, and let her &s;ee &s;he was a much more vitious Woman than the Per&s;on &s;he &s;poke of.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, you are very &s;evere to this poor young Woman, for a Tre&s;pa&s;s which I believe Heaven has forgiven her, and for which you &s;ee &s;he is for ever out of Countenance. Nay, Mr. <HI>Bick|er&s;taff,</HI> &s;he interrupted, If you at this Time of Day contradict People of Virtue, and &s;tand up for ill Women&mdash;No, no, Madam, &s;aid I, not &s;o fa&s;t, &s;he is reclaimed, and I fear you never will be. Nay, nay, Madam, do not be in a Pa&s;&s;ion, but let me tell you what you are. You are indeed as good as your Neighbours, but that is being very bad. You are a Woman at the Head of a Family, and lead a perfect Town Lady's Life. You go on your own Way, and con&s;ult nothing but your Gla&s;s. What Imperfections indeed you &s;ee there, you immediately mend as fa&s;t as you can. You may do the &s;ame by the Faults I tell you of, for they are much more in your Power to correct.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="103">
You are to know then, that you Vi&s;iting Ladies, that carry your Virtue from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e with &s;o much Prattle in each other's Applau&s;e, and tri|umph over other People's Faults, I grant you have but the Speculation of Vice in your own Conver|&s;ations, but, promote the Practice of it in all others you have to do with.</P>
<P>As for you, Madam, your Time pa&s;&s;es away in Dre&s;&s;ing, Eating, Sleeping, and Praying. When you ri&s;e in Morning, I grant you an Hour &s;pent very well; but you come out to dre&s;s in &s;o fro|ward a Humour, that the poor Girl who attends you, cur&s;es her very Being in that &s;he is your Ser|vant, for the peevi&s;h Things you &s;ay to her. When this poor Creature is put into a Way, that Good or Evil are regarded but as they relieve her from the Hours &s;he has and mu&s;t pa&s;s with you. The next you have to do with, is your Coachman and Footmen. They convey your Lady&s;hip to Church. While you are praying there, they are cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, and drinking in an Ale-hou&s;e. During the Time al&s;o which your Lady&s;hip &s;ets apart for Heaven, you are to know, that your Cook is &s;weating and fretting in Preparation for your Dinner. Soon after your Meal you make Vi&s;its, and the whole World that belongs to you &s;peaks all the Ill of you which you are repeating of o|thers. You &s;ee, Madam, whatever Way you go, all about you are in a very broad one. The Mora|lity of the&s;e People it is your proper Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire into; and till you reform them, you had be&s;t let your Equals alone; otherwi&s;e, if I allow you you are not vitious, you mu&s;t allow me you are not virtuous.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t defer my An&s;wer to this Lady out of a Point of Chronology. She &s;ays, &s;he has been Twenty Seven Years a Maid; but I fear, according to a common Error, &s;he dates her Virginity from her Birth, which is a very erroneous Method; for a Woman of Twenty is no more to be thought cha&s;t &s;o many Years, than a Man of that Age can be &s;aid to have been &s;o long Valiant. We mu&s;t not allow People the Favour of a Virtue till they have been under the Temptation to the contrary. A Woman is not a Maid till her Birth-Day, as we call it, of her Fifteenth Year. My Plaintiff is there|fore de&s;ired to inform me, whether &s;he is at pre|&s;ent in her Twenty eighth or Forty third Year, and &s;he &s;hall be di&s;patched accordingly.</P>

<P>A Merchant came hither this Morning, and read a Letter from a Corre&s;pondent of his at <HI>Milan.</HI> It was dated of the 7th In&s;tant. N. S. The following is an Ab&s;tract of it. On the 25th of the la&s;t Month Five Thou&s;and Men were on their March in the <HI>Lampourdan,</HI> under the Command of General <HI>We+&s;ell,</HI> having received Orders from his Catholick Maje&s;ty to join him in his Camp with all po&s;&s;ible

Expedition. The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> &s;oon had Intelli|gence of their Motion, and took a Re&s;olution to decamp, in order to intercept them, within a Day's March of our Army. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was ap|prehen&s;ive the Enemy might make &s;uch a Move|ment, and commanded General <HI>Stanhope</HI> with a Body of Hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of Fourteen Squadrons, to ob&s;erve their Cour&s;e, and prevent their Pa&s;&s;age over the Rivers <HI>Segra</HI> and <HI>Noguera</HI> between <HI>Larida</HI> and <HI>Balaguer.</HI> It happened to be the fir&s;t Day that Officer had appeared Abroad after a dangerous and violent Fever; but he received the King's Com|mands on this Occa&s;ion with a Joy which &s;ur|mounted his pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s, and on the 27th of la&s;t Month came up with the Enemy on the Plains of <HI>Balaguer.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Rear-Guard con&s;i&s;ting of Twenty &s;ix Squadrons, that General &s;ent Intelligence of their Po&s;ture to the King, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty's Orders to attack them. During the Time which he waited for his In&s;tructions, he made his Di&s;po&s;ition for the Charge, which was to divide them&s;elves into Three Bodies; One to be commanded by him&s;elf in the Center, a Body on the Right by Count <HI>Mau|rice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and the Third on the Left by the Earl of <HI>Rochford.</HI> Upon the Receipt of his Ma|je&s;ty's Direction to attack the Enemy, the General him&s;elf charged with the utmo&s;t Vigour and Re|&s;olution, while the Earl of <HI>Rochford</HI> and Count <HI>Maurice</HI> extended them&s;elves on his Right and Left, to prevent the Advantage the Enemy might make of the Superiority of their Numbers. What appears to have mi&s;led the Enemy's General in this Affair was, that it was not &s;uppo&s;ed practicable that the Confederates would attack him till they had received a Reinforcement. For this Rea&s;on he pur&s;ued his March without facing about, till we were actually coming on to Engagement. Gene|ral <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s Di&s;po&s;ition made it impracticable to do it at that Time, Count <HI>Maurice</HI> and the Earl

of <HI>Rochford</HI> attacking them in the In&s;tant in which they were forming them&s;elves. The Charge was made with the greate&s;t Gallantry, and the Enemy very &s;oon put into &s;o great Di&s;order, that their whole Cavalry were commanded to &s;upport their Rear-Guard. Upon the Advance of this Rein|forcement, all the Hor&s;e of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were come up to &s;u&s;tain General <HI>Stanhope,</HI> in&s;o|much that the Battle improved to a general En|gagement of the Cavalry of both Armies. After a warm Di&s;pute for &s;ome Time, it ended in the utter Defeat of all the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Hor&s;e. Upon the Di&s;patch of the&s;e Advices, that Prince was retiring towards <HI>Lerida.</HI> We have no Ac|count of any con&s;iderable Lo&s;s on our Side, except that both tho&s;e Heroick Youths, the Earl of <HI>Roch|ford</HI> and Count <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> fell in this Action. They were, you know, both Sons of Per&s;ons who had a great Place in the Confidence of your late King <HI>William;</HI> and I doubt not but their Deaths will endear their Families, which were ennobled by him, in your Nation. General <HI>Stanhope</HI> has been reported by the Enemy dead of his Wounds; but he received only a &s;light Contu&s;ion on the Shoul|der.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> We acknowledge you here a mighty brave People; but you are &s;aid to love quarrelling &s;o well, that you cannot be quiet at Home. The Favourers of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> among us affirm, That this <HI>Stanhope,</HI> who could as it were get out of his &s;ick Bed to fight again&s;t their King of <HI>Spain,</HI> mu&s;t be of the Antimonarchical Party.</P>

<P>IF there were no other Con&s;equence of it, but barely that Humane Creatures on this Day a&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves before their Creator, with|out Regard to their u&s;ual Employments, their Minds at Lei&s;ure from the Cares of this Life, and their Bodies adorned with the be&s;t Attire they can be&s;tow on them; I &s;ay, were this meer outward Celebration of a Sabbath all that is ex|pected from Men, even that were a laudable Di|&s;tinction, and a Purpo&s;e worthy the Humane Na|ture. But when there is added to it the &s;ublime Plea&s;ure of Devotion, our Being is exalted above it &s;elf; and he who &s;pends a Seventh Day in the Contemplation of the next Life, will not ea&s;ily fall into the Corruptions of this in the other Six. They who never admit Thoughts of this Kind into their Imagination, lo&s;e higher and &s;weeter Satisfactions than can be rai&s;ed by any other En|tertainment. The mo&s;t illiterate Man who is touched with Devotion, and u&s;es frequent Exer|ci&s;es of it, contracts a certain Greatne&s;s of Mind, mingled with a noble Simplicity, that rai&s;es him above tho&s;e of the &s;ame Condition; and there is an indelible Mark of Goodne&s;s in tho&s;e who &s;in|cerely po&s;&s;e&s;s it. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; for the Fervours of a pious Mind will naturally contract &s;uch an Earne&s;tne&s;s and Attention towards a better Being, as will make
<PB N="98" REF="108">
the ordinary Pa&s;&s;ages of Life go off with a be|coming Indifference. By this, a Man in the lowe&s;t Condition will not appear mean, or in the mo&s;t &s;plendid Fortune, in&s;olent.</P>
<P>As to all the Intricacies and Vici&s;&s;itudes under which Men are ordinarily intangled with the ut|mo&s;t Sorrow and Pa&s;&s;ion, one who is devoted to Heaven when he falls into &s;uch Difficulties is led by a Clue through a Labyrinth. As to this World, he does not pretend to Skill in the Mazes of it, but fixes his Thoughts upon one Certainty, that he &s;hall &s;oon be out of it. And we may ask very boldly, What can be a more &s;ure Con&s;ola|tion than to have an Hope in Death? When Men are arrived at thinking of their very Di&s;&s;olution with Plea&s;ure, how few Things are there that can be terrible to them? Certainly nothing can be dreadful to &s;uch Spirits, but what would make Death terrible to them, Fal&s;hood towards Man, or Impiety towards Heaven. To &s;uch as the&s;e, as there are certainly many &s;uch, the Gratifications of innocent Plea&s;ures are doubled, even with Re|flections upon their Imperfection. The Di&s;ap|pointments which naturally attend the great Pro|mi&s;es we make our &s;elves in expected Enjoy|ments, &s;trike no Damp upon &s;uch Men, but only quicken their Hopes of &s;oon knowing Joys, which are too pure to admit of Allay or Sa|tiety.</P>
<P>It is thought among the politer Part of Man|kind an Imperfection to want a Reli&s;h of any of tho&s;e Things which refine our Lives. This is the Foundation of the Acceptance which Eloquence, Mu&s;ick, and Poetry, make in the World; and I know not why Devotion, con&s;idered meerly as an Exaltation of our Happine&s;s, &s;hould not at lea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;o far regarded as to be con&s;idered. It is po&s;+&s;ible the very Enquiry would lead Men into &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Thoughts and Gratifications as they did not ex+pect to meet with in this Place. Many a goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="99" REF="109">
Acquaintance has been lo&s;t from a general Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his Disfavour, and a &s;evere A&s;pect has often hid under it a very agreeable Compa|nion.</P>
<P>There are no di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities among Men to which there are not fal&s;e Pretenders; but tho' none is more pretended to than that of De|votion, there are, perhaps, fewer &s;ucce&s;sful Im|po&s;tors in this Kind than any other. There is &s;omething &s;o natively great and good in a Per&s;on that is truly devout, that an aukward Man may as well pretend to be genteel, as an Hypocrite to be pious. The Con&s;traint in Words and Actions are equally vi&s;ible in both Ca&s;es, and any Thing &s;et up in their Room does but remove the En|deavourers the further off their Preten&s;ions. But however the Sen&s;e of true Piety is abated, there is no other Motive of Action that can carry us through all the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Life with Alacrity and Re&s;olution. But Piety, like Philo&s;ophy, when it is &s;uperficial, does but make Men ap|pear the wor&s;e for it; and a Principle that is but half received, does but di&s;tract, in&s;tead of gui|ding our Behaviour. When I reflect upon the unequal Conduct of <HI>Lotius,</HI> I &s;ee many Things that run directly counter to his Intere&s;t; there|fore I cannot attribute his Labours for the publick Good to Ambition. When I con&s;ider his Di&s;re|gard to his Fortune, I cannot e&s;teem him cove|tous. How then can I reconcile his Neglect of him&s;elf, and his Zeal for others? I have long &s;u&s;pected him to be <HI>a little Pious:</HI> But no Man ever hid his Vice with greater Caution than he does his Virtue. It was the Prai&s;e of a great <HI>Ro|man,</HI> That he had rather be, than appear good. But &s;uch is the Weakne&s;s of <HI>Lotius,</HI> that I dare &s;ay, he had rather be e&s;teemed irreligious, than devout. By I know not what Impatience of Rail|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ery he is wonderfully fearful of being thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oo great a Believer. A Hundred little Devices
<PB N="100" REF="110">
are made u&s;e of to hide a Time of private Devo|tion; and he will allow you any Su&s;picion of his being ill employed, &s;o you do not tax him with being well. But alas! How mean is &s;uch a Be|haviour? To boa&s;t of Virtue is a mo&s;t ridiculous Way of di&s;appointing the Merit of it, but not &s;o pitiful as that of being a&s;hamed of it. How un|happy is the Wretch who makes the mo&s;t ab&s;o|lute and independent Motive of Action the Cau&s;e of Perplexity and Incon&s;tancy? How much ano|ther Figure does <HI>Caelicola</HI> make with all who know him? His great and &s;uperior Mind, fre|quently exalted by the Raptures of Heavenly Me|ditation, is to all his Friends of the &s;ame U&s;e as if an Angel were to appear at the Deci&s;ion of their Di&s;putes. They very well under&s;tand he is as much di&s;intere&s;ted and unbia&s;s'd as &s;uch a Be|ing. He con&s;iders all Applications made to him, as tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es will effect his own Applica|tion to Heaven. All his Determinations are de|liver'd with a beautiful Humility; and he pro|nounces his Deci&s;ions with the Air of one who is more frequently a Supplicant than a Judge.</P>
<P>Thus humble, and thus great, is the Man who is moved by Piety, and exalted by Devotion. But behold this recommended by the ma&s;terly Hand of a great Divine I have heretofore made bold with.</P>
<Q>It is &s;uch a Plea&s;ure as can never cloy or overwork the Mind; a Delight that grows and improves under Thought and Reflection; and while it exerci&s;es, does al&s;o endear it &s;elf to the Mind. All Plea&s;ure that affect the Body mu&s;t needs weary, becau&s;e they tran&s;port; and all Tran&s;portation is a Violence; and no Violence can be la&s;ting, but determines upon the Falling of the Spirits, which are not able to keep up that Height of Motion that the Plea+&s;ure of the Sen&s;es rai&s;es them to. And there+fore how inevitably does an immoderate Laugh+ter <PB N="101" REF="111">
end in a Sigh, which is only Nature's reco|vering it &s;elf after a Force done to it: But the religious Plea&s;ure of a well-di&s;po&s;ed Mind moves gently, and therefore con&s;tantly. It does not effect by Rapture and Exta&s;ie, but is like the Plea&s;ure of Health, greater and &s;tronger than tho&s;e that call up the Sen&s;es with gro&s;&s;er and more affecting Impre&s;&s;ions. No Man's Body is as &s;trong as his Appetites; but Heaven has cor|rected the Boundle&s;ne&s;s of his voluptuous De|&s;ires by &s;tinting his Strengths, and contracting his Capacities.&mdash;The Plea&s;ure of the reli|gious Man is an ea&s;y and a portable Plea&s;ure, &s;uch an one as he carries about in his Bo&s;om, without alarming either the Eye or Envy of the World. A Man putting all his Plea&s;ure into this one, is like a Traveller putting all his Goods into one Jewel; the Value is the &s;ame, and the Convenience greater.</Q>

</LETTER>
<P>I think the Lady's Brother has given us a very good Idea of that elegant Expre&s;&s;ion, it being the greate&s;t Beauty of Speech to be clo&s;e and intelli|gible. To this End nothing is to be more care|fully con&s;ulted than Plainne&s;s. In a Lady's At|tire this is the &s;ingle Excellence; for to be what &s;ome call fine, is the &s;ame Vice in that Ca&s;e, as to be florid is in Writing or Speaking. I have &s;tudied and writ on this important Subject till I almo&s;t de&s;pair of making a Reformation in the Females of this I&s;land, where we have more Beauty than in any Spot in the Univer&s;e, if we did not di&s;gui&s;e it by fal&s;e Garniture, and detract from it by impertinent Improvements. I have by me a Treati&s;e concerning Pinners, which I have &s;ome Hopes will contribute to the Amend|ment of the pre&s;ent Head-dre&s;&s;es, to which I have &s;olid and unan&s;werable Objections. But mo&s;t of the Errors in that and other Particulars of adorning the Head, are crept into the World from the Ignorance of modern Tirewomen; for it is come to that Pa&s;s, that an aukward Crea|ture in the fir&s;t Year of her Apprentice&s;hip, that can hardly &s;tick a Pin, &s;hall take upon her to dre&s;s a Woman of the Fir&s;t Quality. However it is certain, that there requires in a good Tire|woman a perfect Skill in Opticks; for all the Force of Ornament is to contribute to the Inten|tion of the Eyes. Thus &s;he who has a Mind to look killing, mu&s;t arm her Face accordingly, and not leave her Eyes and Cheeks undre&s;&s;ed. Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> is <HI>Araminta</HI> &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that &s;he neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

will &s;ee even her own Husband without a Hood on. Can any one living bear to &s;ee Mi&s;s <HI>Gruel,</HI> lean as &s;he is, with her Hair tied back after the modern Way? But &s;uch is the Folly of our La|dies, that becau&s;e one who is a Beauty, out of O&s;tentation of her being &s;uch, takes Care to wear &s;omething that &s;he knows cannot be of any Con&s;equence to her Complexion; I &s;ay, our Wo|men run on &s;o heedle&s;ly in the Fa&s;hion, that tho' it is the Intere&s;t of &s;ome to hide as much of their Faces as po&s;&s;ible, yet becau&s;e a leading Toa&s;t ap|peared with a backward Head-dre&s;s, the re&s;t &s;hall follow the Mode, without ob&s;erving that the Author of the Fa&s;hion a&s;&s;umed it becau&s;e it could become no one but her &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Flavia</HI> is ever well dre&s;&s;ed, and always the gentile&s;t Woman you meet: But the Make of her Mind very much contributes to the Ornament of her Body. She has the greate&s;t Simplicity of Manners of any of her Sex. This makes every Thing look native about her, and her Cloaths are &s;o exactly fitted, that they appear as it were Part of her Per&s;on. Every one that &s;ees her, knows her to be of Quality; but her Di&s;tinction is owing to her Manner, and not to her Habit. Her Beauty is full of Attraction, but not of Al|lurement. There is &s;uch a Compo&s;ure in her Looks, and Propriety in her Dre&s;s, that you would think it impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould change the Garb you one Day &s;ee her in for any Thing &s;o becoming, till you next Day &s;ee her in another. There is no other My&s;tery in this, but that how|ever &s;he is apparelled, &s;he is her &s;elf the &s;ame: For there is &s;o immediate a Relation between our Thoughts and Ge&s;tures, that a Woman mu&s;t think well to look well.</P>
<P>But this weighty Subject I mu&s;t put off for &s;ome other Matters in which my Corre&s;pondents are urgent for An&s;wers, which I &s;hall do where I

<P>THere has of late crept in among the downright <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a mighty Spirit of Di&s;&s;imulation. But before we di&s;cour&s;e of this Vice, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the Learned make a Dif|ference between Simulation and Di&s;&s;imulation. Si|mulation is a Pretence of what is not, and Di&s;|&s;imulation a Concealment of what is. The lat|ter
<PB N="106" REF="116">
is our pre&s;ent Affair. When you look round you in publick Places in this I&s;land, you &s;ee the Generality of Mankind carry in their Counte|nance an Air of Challenge or Defiance: And there is no &s;uch Man to be found among us who naturally &s;trives to do greater Honours and Civi|lities than he receives. This innate Sullenne&s;s or Stubborne&s;s of Complexion is hardly to be con|quered by any of our I&s;landers. For which Rea|&s;on, however they may pretend to choo&s;e one another, they make but very aukward Rogues; and their Di&s;like to each other is &s;eldom &s;o well di&s;&s;embled, but it is &s;u&s;pected. When once it is &s;o, it had as good be profe&s;&s;ed. A Man who di&s;|&s;embles well, mu&s;t have none of what we call Stomach, otherwi&s;e he will be cold in his Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Good-Will where he hates; an Imper|fection of the la&s;t ill Con&s;equence in Bu&s;ine&s;s. This Fiercene&s;s in our Natures is apparent from the Conduct of our young Fellows, who are not got into the Schemes and Arts of Life which the Children of this World walk by. One would think that of Cour&s;e, when a Man of any Con|&s;equence for his Figure, his Mien, or his Gravity, pa&s;&s;es by a Youth, he &s;hould certainly have the fir&s;t Advances of Salutation; but he is, you may ob&s;erve, treated in a quite different Manner, it being the very Characteri&s;tick of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Temper to defy. As I am an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> I find it a very hard Matter to bring my &s;elf to pull off the Hat fir&s;t; but it is the only Way to be upon any good Terms with tho&s;e we meet with: There|fore the fir&s;t Advance is of high Moment. Men judge of others by them&s;elves; and he that will command with us, mu&s;t conde&s;cend. It moves ones Spleen very agreeably to &s;ee Fellows pre|tend to be Di&s;&s;emblers without this Le&s;&s;on. They are &s;o re&s;ervedly complai&s;ant till they have learn+ed to re&s;ign their natural Pa&s;&s;ions, that all the Steps they make towards gaining tho&s;e whom
<PB N="107" REF="117">
they would be well with, are but &s;o many Marks of what they really are, and not of what they would appear.</P>

<P>I Have lately read your Paper, wherein you repre&s;ent a Conver&s;ation between a young Lady, your Three Nephews, and your &s;elf; and am not a little offended at the Figure you give your young Merchant in the Pre&s;ence of a Beau|ty. The Topick of Love is a Subject on which a Man is more beholden to Nature for his Elo|quence, than to the In&s;truction of the Schools, or my Lady's Woman. From the Two latter, your Scholar and Page mu&s;t have reaped all their Advantage above him&mdash;I know by this Time you have pronounced me a Trader. I ac|knowledge it, but cannot bear the Exclu&s;ion from any Pretence of &s;peaking agreeably to a Fine Woman, or from any Degree of Genero|&s;ity that Way. You have among us Citizens

many Well-wi&s;hers, but it is for the Ju&s;tice of your Repre&s;entations, which we, perhaps, are better Judges of than you (by the Account you give of your Nephew) &s;eem to allow.</P>
<P>To give you an Opportunity of making us &s;ome Reparation, I de&s;ire you would tell your own Way the following In&s;tance of Heroick Love in the City. You are to remember, that &s;omewhere in your Writings, for enlarging the Territories of Virtue and Honour, you have multiplied the Opportunities of attaining to He|roick Virtue, and have hinted, that in whatever State of Life a Man is, if he does Things above what is ordinarily performed by Men of his Rank, he is in tho&s;e In&s;tances an Hero.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Trueman,</HI> a young Gentleman of Eighteen Years of Age, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with the beauteous <HI>Almira,</HI> Daughter to his Ma&s;ter. Her Regard for him was no le&s;s tender. <HI>True|man</HI> was better acquainted with his Ma&s;ter's Affairs than his Daughter, and &s;ecretly lament|ed, that each Day brought him by many Mi&s;|carriages nearer Bankrupcy than the former. This unhappy Po&s;ture of their Affairs the Youth &s;u&s;pected was owing to the ill Manage|ment of a Factor, in whom his Ma&s;ter had an entire Confidence. <HI>Trueman</HI> took a proper Oc|ca&s;ion, when his Ma&s;ter was ruminating on his decaying Fortune, to addre&s;s him for Leave to &s;pend the Remainder of his Time with his Fo|reign Corre&s;pondent. During Three Years Stay in that Employment, he became acquaint|ed with all that concerned his Ma&s;ter; and by his great Addre&s;s in the Management of that Knowledge, &s;aved him Ten thou&s;and Pounds. Soon after this Accident, <HI>Trueman</HI>'s Unkle left him a con&s;iderable E&s;tate. Upon receiving that Advice, he returned to <HI>England,</HI> and deman|ded <HI>Almira</HI> of her Father. The Father over joy'd at the Match, offer'd him the 10000 <HI>l.</HI> he

had &s;aved him, with the further Propo&s;al of re&s;igning to him all his Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Trueman</HI> re|fu&s;ed both, and retired into the Country with his Bride, contented with his own Fortune, tho' perfectly skill'd in all the Methods of improving it.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, That <HI>Trueman</HI> refu&s;ed Twen|ty Thou&s;and Pounds with another young Lady; &s;o that reckoning both his Self-Denials, he is to have in your Court the Merit of having gi|ven 30000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Woman he loved.

<P>IN every Party there are Two Sorts of Men, the <HI>Rigid</HI> and the <HI>Supple.</HI> The <HI>Rigid</HI> are an intractable Race of Mortals, who act upon Prin|ciple, and will not, for&s;ooth, fall into any Mea|&s;ures that are not con&s;i&s;tent with their received
<PB N="110" REF="120">
Notions of Honour. The&s;e are Per&s;ons of a &s;tub|born, unpliant Morality, that &s;ullenly adhere to their Friends when they are di&s;graced, and to their Principles, tho' they are exploded. I &s;hall therefore give up this &s;tiff-necked Generation to their own Ob&s;tinacy, and turn my Thoughts to the Advantage of the <HI>Supple,</HI> who pay their Ho|mage to Places, and not Per&s;ons; and without en&s;laving them&s;elves to any particular Scheme of Opinions, are as ready to change their Conduct in Point of Sentiment, as of Fa&s;hion. The well|di&s;ciplined Part of a Court are generally &s;o per|fect at their Exerci&s;e, that you may &s;ee a whole A&s;&s;embly, from Front to Rear, face about at once to a new Man of Power, tho' at the &s;ame Time they turn their Backs upon him that brought them thither. The great Hard&s;hip the&s;e com|plai&s;ant Members of Society are under, &s;eems to be the Want of Warning upon any approaching Change or Revolution; &s;o that they are obliged in a Hurry to tack about with every Wind, and &s;top &s;hort in the Mid&s;t of a full Career, to the great Surprize and Deri&s;ion of their Beholders.</P>
<P>When a Man fore&s;ees a decaying Mini&s;try, he has Lei&s;ure to grow a Malecontent, reflect upon the pre&s;ent Conduct, and by gradual Murmurs fall off from his Friends into a new Party, by ju&s;t Steps and Mea&s;ures. For Want of &s;uch No|tices, I have formerly known a very well-bred Per&s;on refu&s;e to return a Bow of a Man whom he thought in Di&s;grace, that was next Day made Se|cretary of State; and another, who after a long Neglect of a Mini&s;ter, came to his Levee, and made Profe&s;&s;ions of Zeal for his Service the very Day before he was turned out.</P>
<P>This produces al&s;o unavoidable Confu&s;ions and Mi&s;takes in the De&s;criptions of great Mens Parts and Merits. That ancient Lyrick, Mr. <HI>D'Urfey,</HI> &s;ome Years ago writ a Dedication to a certain Lord, in which he celebrated him for the greate&s;t
<PB N="111" REF="121">
Poet and Critick of that Age, upon a Mi&s;infor|mation in <HI>Dyer</HI>'s Letter, that his noble Patron was made Lord Chamberlain. In &s;hort, innume|rable Votes Speeches, and Sermons, have been thrown away, and turned to no Account, meerly for Want of due and timely Intelligence. Nay it has been known, that a Panegyrick has been half printed off, when the Poet, upon the Removal of the Mini&s;ter, has been forced to alter it into a Satyr.</P>
<P>For the Conduct therefore of &s;uch u&s;eful Per|&s;ons as are ready to do their Country Service up|on all Occa&s;ions, I have an Engine in my Study, which is a Sort of a Political Barometer, or, to &s;peak more intelligibly, a State <HI>Weather-Gla&s;s,</HI> that, by the ri&s;ing and falling of a certain Magi|cal Liquor, pre&s;ages all Changes and Revolu|tions in Government, as the common Gla&s;s does tho&s;e of the Weather. This Weather-Gla&s;s is &s;aid to have been invented by <HI>Cardan,</HI> and given by him as a Pre&s;ent to his great Countryman and Contemporary <HI>Machiavel,</HI> which (by the Way) may &s;erve to rectify a received Error in Chronology, that places one of the&s;e &s;ome Years after the other. How or when it came into my Hands, I &s;hall de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed, if I keep to my &s;elf; but &s;o it is, that I have walked by it for the better Part of a Century, to my Safety at lea&s;t, if not to my Advantage; and have among my Papers, a Regi&s;ter of all the Changes that have happened in it from the Middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>In the Time of that Prince&s;s, it &s;tood long at <HI>&s;ettled Fair.</HI> At the latter End of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, it fell to <HI>Cloudy.</HI> It held &s;everal Years after at <HI>Stormy;</HI> in&s;omuch that at la&s;t de&s;pairing of &s;eeing any <HI>Clear</HI> Weather at Home, I follow'd the Royal Exile, and &s;ome Time after finding my Gla&s;s ri&s;e, returned to my native Country with the re&s;t of the Loyali&s;ts. I was then in
<PB N="112" REF="122">
Hopes to pa&s;s the Remainder of my Days in <HI>&s;et|tled Fair:</HI> But alas! during the greate&s;t Part of that Reign, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation lay in a <HI>dead Calm,</HI> which, as it is u&s;ual, was followed by high Winds and Tempe&s;ts till of late Years: In which, with un&s;peakable Joy and Satisfaction, I have &s;een our Political Weather returned to <HI>&s;ettled Fair.</HI> I mu&s;t only ob&s;erve, that for all this la&s;t Summer my Gla&s;s has pointed at Changeable. Upon the whole, I often apply to Fortune <HI>Aenaeas</HI>'s Speech to the Sybil:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Non ulla Laborum,</L>
<L>O Virgo, nova mi Facies inopinave &s;urgit</L>
<L>Omnia praecepi, at&abque; Animo mecum ante peregi.</L></Q>
<P>The Advantages which have accured to tho&s;e whom I have advi&s;ed in their Affairs, by Vertue of this Sort of Prae&s;cience, have been very con&s;i|derable. A Nephew of mine, who has never put his Money into the Stocks, or taken it out, without my Advice, has in a few Years rai&s;ed Five hundred Pounds to almo&s;t &s;o many Thou|&s;ands. As for my &s;elf, who look upon Riches to con&s;i&s;t rather in Content than Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and mea&s;ure the Greatne&s;s of the Mind rather by its Tranquility than its Ambition. I have &s;eldom u&s;ed my Gla&s;s to make my Way in the World, but often to retire from it. This is a By-Path to Happine&s;s, which was fir&s;t di&s;covered to me by a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Apothegm of <HI>Pythagoras: When the Winds,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ri&s;e, wor&s;hip the Eccho.</HI> That great Philo&s;opher (whether to make his Doctrines the more venerable, or to guild his Precepts with the Beauty of Imagination, or to awaken the Curio&s;ity of his Di&s;ciples; for I will not &s;up|po&s;e what is u&s;ually &s;aid, that he did it to conceal his Wi&s;dom from the Vulgar) has couched &s;eve|ral admirable Precepts in remote Allu&s;ions and my&s;terious Sentences.

<P><HI>LY&s;ander</HI> has writ to me out of the Country, and tells me, after many other Circum|&s;tances, that he had pa&s;&s;ed a great deal of Time with much Plea&s;ure and Tranquility, till his Happine&s;s was interrupted by an indi&s;creet Flat|terer, who came down into tho&s;e Parts to vi&s;it a Relation. With the Circum&s;tances in which he repre&s;ents the Matter, he had no &s;mall Provoca|tion to be offended, for he attacked him in &s;o wrong a Sea&s;on, that he could not have any Re|li&s;h of Plea&s;ure in it; tho', perhaps, at another Time, it might have pa&s;&s;ed upon him without giving him much Unea&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> had, af|ter a long Satiety of the Town, been &s;o happy as to get to a Solitude he extremely liked, and re|covered a Plea&s;ure he had long di&s;continued, that of Reading. He was got to the Bank of a Ri|vulet, covered by a plea&s;ing Shade, and fanned by a &s;oft Breeze, which threw his Mind into that Sort of Compo&s;ure and Attention, in which a Man, though with Indolence, enjoys the utmo&s;t Liveline&s;s of his Spirits, and the greate&s;t Strength of his Mind at the &s;ame Time. In this State, <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> repre&s;ents that he was reading <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgicks;</HI> when on a &s;udden the Gentleman abovementioned &s;urpri&s;ed him, and, without any
<PB N="114" REF="124">
Manner of Preparation, falls upon him at once, <Q REND="inline">'What! I have found you out at la&s;t, after &s;earching all over the Wood. We wanted you at Cards after Dinner, but you are much better employed. I have heard indeed that you are an excellent Scholar: But at the &s;ame Time, is it not a little unkind to rob the Ladies, who like you &s;o well, of the Plea&s;ure of your Com|pany? But that is indeed the Misfortune of you great Scholars, you are &s;eldom &s;o fit for the World, as tho&s;e who never trouble them&s;elves with Books. Well, I &s;ee you are taken up with your Learning there, and I'll leave you.'</Q> <HI>Ly|&s;ander</HI> &s;ays, he made him no An&s;wer, but took a Re&s;olution to complain to me.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ub&s;tantial Affliction, when Men govern them&s;elves by the Rules of good Breeding, that by the very Force of them they are &s;ubjected to the In&s;olence of tho&s;e who either never will, or never can, under&s;tand them. The &s;uperficial Part of Mankind form to them&s;elves little Mea|&s;ures of Behaviour from the Out&s;ide of Things. By the Force of the&s;e narrow Conceptions, they act among&s;t them&s;elves with Applau&s;e, and do not apprehend they are contemptible to tho&s;e of higher Under&s;tanding, who are re&s;trained by De|cencies above their Knowledge from &s;howing a Di&s;like. Hence it is, that becau&s;e Complai&s;ance is a good Quality in Conver&s;ation, one Imperti|nent takes upon him on all Occa&s;ions to com|mend; and becau&s;e Mirth is agreeable, another thinks fit eternally to je&s;t. I have of late re|ceived many Packets of Letters complaining of the&s;e &s;preading Evils. A Lady who is lately ar|rived at the <HI>Bath</HI> acquaints me, there was in the Stage-Coach wherein &s;he went down a common Flatterer, and a common Je&s;ter. The&s;e Gentle|men were (&s;he tells me) Rivals in her Favour and adds, If there ever happened a Ca&s;e wherein of Two Per&s;ons One was not liked more than
<PB N="115" REF="125">
another, it was in that Journey. They differed only in Proportion to the Degree of Di&s;like be|tween the Nau&s;eous and the In&s;ipid. Both the&s;e Characters of Men are born out of a Barrenne&s;s of Imagination. They are never Fools by Na|ture, but become &s;uch out of an impotent Ambi|tion of being what &s;he never intended them, Men of Wit and Conver&s;ation. I therefore think fit to declare, That according to the known Laws of this Land, a Man may be a very hone&s;t Gen|tleman, and enjoy him&s;elf and his Friend, with|out being a Wit; and I ab&s;olve all Men from ta|king Pains to be &s;uch for the future. As the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e &s;tands, is it not very unhappy that <HI>Ly|&s;ander</HI> mu&s;t be attacked and applauded in a Wood, and <HI>Corinna</HI> jolted and commended in a Stage-Coach; and this for no manner of Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e other People have a Mind to &s;how their Parts? I grant indeed, if the&s;e People (as they have Under&s;tanding enough for it) would confine their Accompli&s;hments to tho&s;e of their own Degree of Talents, it were to be tolerated; but when they are &s;o in&s;olent as to interrupt the Meditations of the Wi&s;e, the Conver&s;ations of the Agreeable, and the whole Behaviour of the Mode&s;t, it becomes a Grievance naturally in my Juri&s;diction. Among them&s;elves, I cannot only overlook, but approve it. I was pre&s;ent the o|ther Day at a Conver&s;ation, where a Man of this Height of Breeding and Sen&s;e told a young Wo|man of the &s;ame Form, To be &s;ure, Madam, eve|ry Thing mu&s;t plea&s;e that comes from a Lady. She an&s;wer'd, I know, Sir, you are &s;o much a Gentleman that you think &s;o. Why, this is very well on both Sides; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a Gentleman and Lady &s;hould do other than think well of one another, The&s;e are but loo&s;e Hints of the Di&s;turbances in humane Society, of which there is yet no Remedy: But I &s;hall in a little Time publi&s;h Tables of Re&s;pect and Civility, by

<P>NAture is full of Wonders; every Atom is a &s;tanding Miracle, and endowed with &s;uch Qualities, as could not be impre&s;&s;ed on it by a Power and Wi&s;dom le&s;s than Infinite. For this Rea&s;on, I would not di&s;courage any Searches that are made into the mo&s;t minute and trivial Parts of the Creation. However, &s;ince the World a|bounds in the noble&s;t Fields of Speculation, it is, methinks, the Mark of a little Genius to be wholly conver&s;ant among In&s;ects, Reptiles, Ani|malcules, and tho&s;e trifling Rarities that furni&s;h out the Apartment of a Virtuo&s;o.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Men who&s;e Heads are &s;o odly turned this Way, that tho' they are utter Stran|gers to the common Occurrences of Life, they are able to di&s;cover the Sex of a Cockle, or de|&s;cribe the Generation of a Mite, in all its Circum|&s;tances.

<P>It is indeed wonderful to con&s;ider, that there &s;hould be a Sort of learned Men who are wholly employed in gathering together the Refu&s;e of Na|ture, if I may call it &s;o, and hoarding up in their Che&s;ts and Cabinets &s;uch Creatures as others in|du&s;triou&s;ly avoid the Sight of. One does not know how to mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t precious Parts of their Trea&s;ure, without a Kind of an Apology for it. I have been &s;hown a Beetle va|lued at Twenty Crowns, and a Toad at an Hun|dred; But we mu&s;t take this for a general Rule, That whatever appears trivial or ob&s;cene in the common Notions of the World, looks grave and philo&s;ophical in the Eye of a Virtuo&s;o.</P>

<P>AS I was pa&s;&s;ing by a Neighbour's Hou&s;e this Morning, I overheard the Wife of the Fa|mily &s;peak Things to her Husband which gave me much Di&s;turbance, and put me in Mind of a Character which I wonder I have &s;o long omit|ted, and that is, an outragious Species of the Fair Sex which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Term Scolds. The Generality of Women are by Na|ture loquacious: Therefore meer Volubility of Speech is not to be imputed to them, but &s;hould be con&s;idered with Plea&s;ure when it is u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions as tend to &s;weeten or adorn Conver&s;ation: But when, thro' Rage, Females are vehement in their Eloquence, nothing in the World has &s;o ill an Effect upon the Features; for by the Force of it, I have &s;een the mo&s;t Amiable become the mo&s;t Deformed; and &s;he that ap|peared one of the Graces, immediately turned into one of the Furies. I humbly conceive, the great Cau&s;e of this Evil may proceed from a fal&s;e Notion the Ladies have of what we call a Mode&s;t Woman. They have too narrow a Conception of this lovely Character, and believe they have not at all forfeited their Preten&s;ions to it, provided they have no Imputations on their Cha&s;tity. But alas! the young Fellows know they pick out bet|ter Women in the Side-Boxes, than many of tho&s;e who pa&s;s upon the World and them&s;elves for Mo|de&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133">
Mode&s;ty never rages, never murmurs, never pouts: When it is ill treated, it pines, it be|&s;eeches, it langui&s;hes. The Neighbour I men|tion is one of your common mode&s;t Women, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e as are ordinarily reckoned &s;uch. Her Husband knows every Pain in Life with her but Jealou&s;y. Now becau&s;e &s;he is clear in this Particular, the Man can't &s;ay his Soul's his own, but &s;he cries, No mode&s;t Woman is re&s;pected now a-days. What adds to the Comedy in this Ca&s;e is, that it is very ordinary with this Sort of Women to talk in the Language of Di&s;tre&s;s: They will complain of the forlorn Wretchedne&s;s of their Condition, and then the poor helple&s;s Creatures &s;hall throw the next Thing they can lay their Hands on at the Per&s;on who offends them. Our Neighbour was only &s;aying to his Wife, &s;he went a little too fine, when &s;he imme|diately pulled his Periwig off, and &s;tamping it under her Feet, wrung her Hands, and &s;aid, Ne|ver mode&s;t Woman was &s;o u&s;ed: The&s;e Ladies of irre&s;i&s;tible Mode&s;ty are tho&s;e who make Vir|tue unamiable; not that they can be &s;aid to be virtuous, but as they live without Scandal; and being under the common Denomination of being &s;uch, Men fear to meet their Faults in tho&s;e who are as agreeable as they are innocent.</P>
<P>I take the Bully among Men, and the Scold a|mong Women, to draw the Foundation of their Actions from the &s;ame Defect in the Mind A Bully thinks Honour con&s;i&s;ts wholly in being brave, and therefore has Regard to no one Rule of Life, if he pre&s;erves him&s;elf from the Accu&s;a|tion of Cowardize. The froward Woman knows Cha&s;tity to be the fir&s;t Merit in a Woman; and therefore, &s;ince no one can call her one ugly Name, &s;he calls all Mankind all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ladies, where their Companions are &s;o imprudent as to take their Speeches for any other than Exerci&s;es of their own Lungs, and their
<PB N="124" REF="134">
Husbands Patience, gain by the Force of being re&s;i&s;ted, and flame with open Fury, which is no Way to be oppo&s;ed but by being neglected: Tho' at the &s;ame Time Humane Frailty makes it very hard to reli&s;h the Philo&s;ophy of contemning even frivolous Reproach. There is a very pretty In|&s;tance of this Infirmity in the Man of the be&s;t Sen&s;e that ever was, no le&s;s a Per&s;on than <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf. According to <HI>Milton</HI>'s De&s;cription of the Fir&s;t Couple, as &s;oon as they had fallen, and the turbulent Pa&s;&s;ions of Anger, Hatred, and Jea|lou&s;y, fir&s;t enter'd their Brea&s;ts, <HI>Adam</HI> grew moody, and talked to his Wife, as you may find it in the 359th Page, and 9th Book, of <HI>Paradi&s;e Le&s;t,</HI> in the <HI>Octave</HI> Edition, which out of He|roicks, and put into Dome&s;tick Stile, would run thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Madam, If my Advice had been of any Au|thority with you when that &s;trange De&s;ire of Gadding po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed you this Morning, we had &s;till been happy: But your cur&s;ed Vanity and Opi|nion of your own Conduct, which is certainly very wavering when it &s;eeks Occa&s;ions of being proved, has ruined both your &s;elf, and me who tru&s;ted you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Eve</HI> had no Fan in her Hand to ruffle, or Tucker to pull down, but with a reproachful Air &s;he an|&s;wered:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Sir, Do you impute that to my De&s;ire of Gad|ding, which might have happened to your &s;elf with all your Wi&s;dom and Gravity?'</Q> The Ser|pent &s;poke &s;o excellently, and with &s;o good a Grace, that&mdash;Be&s;ides, <Q REND="inline">'What Harm had I ever done him, that he &s;hould de&s;ign me any? Was I to have been always at your Side, I might as well have continued there, and been but your Rib &s;till: But if I was &s;o weak a Creature as you thought me, Why did you not interpo&s;e your &s;age Authority more ab&s;olutely?
<PB N="125" REF="135">
You denied me going as faintly, as you &s;ay I re&s;i&s;ted the Serpent. Had not you been too ea&s;ie, neither you or I had now tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> replied, <Q REND="inline">'Why, <HI>Eve.</HI> ha&s;t thou the Im|pudence to upbraid me as the Cau&s;e of thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion for my Indulgence to thee? Thus it will ever be with him who tru&s;ts too much to Woman: At the &s;ame Time that &s;he refu&s;es to be governed, if &s;he &s;uffers by her O&s;tinacy, &s;he will accu&s;e the Man that &s;hall leave her to her &s;elf.'</Q></P>
<Q><L>Thus they in mutual Accu&s;ation &s;pent</L>
<L>The fruitle&s;s Hours, but neither &s;elf condemning:</L>
<L>And of their vain Conte&s;t appear'd no End.</L></Q>
<P>This to the Modern will appear but a very faint Piece of Conjugal Enmity; but you are to con&s;ider, that they were but ju&s;t begun to be an|gry, and they wanted new Words for expre&s;&s;ing their new Pa&s;&s;ions. But her accu&s;ing him of let|ting her go, and telling him how good a Speaker, and how fine a Gentleman the Devil was, we mu&s;t reckon, allowing for the Improvements of Time, that &s;he gave him the &s;ame Provocation as if &s;he had called him Cuckold. The pa&s;|&s;ionate and familiar Terms with which the &s;ame Ca&s;e, repeated daily for &s;o many Thou&s;and Years, has furni&s;hed the pre&s;ent Generation, were not then in U&s;e; but the Foundation of Debate has ever been the &s;ame, a Contention about their Merit and Wi&s;dom. Our general Mother was a Beauty, and hearing there was another now in the World, could not forbear (as <HI>Adam</HI> tells her) &s;howing her &s;elf, though to the Devil, by whom the &s;ame Vanity made her liable to be be|trayed.</P>
<P>I cannot, with all the Help of Science and, A&s;trology, find any other Remedy for this Evil but what was the Medicine in this fir&s;t Quarrel; which was, as appeared in the next Book, that
<PB N="126" REF="136">
they were convinced of their being both weak, but one weaker than the other.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible that the Beauteous could but rage a little before a Gla&s;s, and &s;ee their pret|ty Countenances grow wild, it is not to be doubt|ed but it would have a very good Effect; but that would require Temper: For Lady <HI>Firebrand,</HI> upon ob&s;erving her Features &s;well when her Maid vexed her the other Day, &s;tamped her Dre&s;&s;ing-Gla&s;s under her Feet. In this Ca&s;e, when one of this Temper is moved, &s;he is like a Witch in an Operation, and makes all Things turn round with her. The very Fabrick is in a Vertigo when &s;he begins to charm. In an In|&s;tant, whatever was the Occa&s;ion that moved her Blood, &s;he has &s;uch intolerable Servants, <HI>Betty</HI> is &s;o aukward, <HI>Tom</HI> can't carry a Me&s;&s;age, and her Husband has &s;o little Re&s;pect for her, that &s;he, poor Woman, is weary of this Life, and was born to be unhappy.</P>

<P>I Chanced to ri&s;e very early one particular Morning this Summer, and took a Walk into the Country to divert my &s;elf among the Fields and Meadows, while the Green was new, and the Flowers in their Bloom. As at this Sea&s;on of the Year every Lane is a beautiful Walk, and every Hedge full of No&s;egays, I lo&s;t my &s;elf with a great deal of Plea&s;ure among &s;everal Thickets and Bu&s;hes that were filled with a great Variety of Birds, and an agreeable Confu&s;ion of Notes, which formed the plea&s;ante&s;t Scene in the World to one who had pa&s;s'd a whole Winter in Noi&s;e and Smoak. The Fre&s;hne&s;s of the Dews that lay upon every Thing about me, with the cool Breath of the Morning, which in&s;pired the Birds with &s;o many delightful In&s;tincts, created in me the &s;ame Kind of animal Plea&s;ure, and made my Heart overflow with &s;uch &s;ecret Emotions of Joy and Satisfaction as are not to be de&s;cribed or ac|counted for. On this Occa&s;ion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful Simile in <HI>Milton:</HI><Q><L>As one who long in populous City pent,</L>
<L>Where Hou&s;es thick, and Sewers, annoy the Air,</L>
<L>Forth i&s;&s;uing on a Summer's Morn, to breath</L>
<L>Among the plea&s;ant Villages, and Farms</L>
<L>Adjoin'd, from each Thing met conceives Delight:</L>
<L>The Smell of Grain, or tedded Gra&s;s, or Kine,</L>
<L>Or Dairy, each rural Sight, each rural Sound.</L></Q> <PB N="128" REF="138">
Tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in the Writings of po|lite Authors, receive an additional Entertainment from the Country, as it revives in their Memories tho&s;e charming De&s;criptions with which &s;uch Authors do frequently abound.</P>
<P>I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful Si|mile in <HI>Milton,</HI> and applying it to my &s;elf, when I ob&s;erved to the Windward of me a black Cloud falling to the Earth in long Trails of Rain, which made me betake my &s;elf for Shelter to a Hou&s;e which I &s;aw at a little Di&s;tance from the Place where I was walking. As I &s;at in the Porch, I heard the Voices of Two or Three Per&s;ons, who &s;eemed very earne&s;t in Di&s;cour&s;e. My Curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed when I heard the Names of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> and <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> and as their Talk &s;eemed to run on ancient Heroes, I concluded there could not be any Secret in it; for which Rea&s;on I thought I might very fairly li&s;ten to what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>After &s;everal Parallels between great Men, which appeared to me altogether groundle&s;s and chimerical, I was &s;urprized to hear one &s;ay, That he valued the <HI>Black Prince</HI> more than the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me.</HI> How the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> &s;hould become a Rival of the <HI>Black Prince</HI>'s, I could not conceive: And was more &s;tartled when I heard a Second affirm with great Vehemence, That if the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> was not going off, he &s;hould like him better than either of them. He added, That tho' the Sea&s;on was &s;o changeable, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was in blooming Beau|ty. I was wondering to my &s;elf from whence they had received this odd Intelligence, e&s;pecial|ly when I heard them mention the Names of &s;e|veral other great Generals, as the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who, they &s;aid, were both running away. To which they added, what I entirely agreed with them in, That the Crown of <HI>France</HI> was very weak, but that the Mare&s;chal
<PB N="129" REF="139">
<HI>Villars</HI> &s;till kept his Colours. At la&s;t one of them told the Company, If they would go along with him, he would &s;how them a Chimney-Sweeper and a Painted Lady in the &s;ame Bed, which he was &s;ure would very much plea&s;e them. The Shower which had driven them, as well as my &s;elf, into the Hou&s;e, was now over: And as they were pa&s;&s;ing by me into the Garden, I asked them to let me be one of their Company.</P>
<P>The Gentleman of the Hou&s;e told me, if I de|lighted in Flowers, it would be worth my while, for that he believed he could &s;how me &s;uch a Blow of Tulips as was not to be matched in the whole Country.</P>
<P>I accepted the Offer, and immediately found that they had been talking in Terms of Garden|ing, and that the Kings and Generals they had mentioned were only &s;o many Tulips, to which the Gardiners, according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, had given &s;uch high Titles and Appellations of Honour.</P>
<P>I was very much plea&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed at the glorious Show of the&s;e gay Vegetables, that aro&s;e in great Profu&s;ion on all the Banks about us. Sometimes I con&s;idered them with the Eye of an ordinary Spectator as &s;o many beautiful Objects, varni&s;hed over with a natural Glo&s;s, and &s;tained with &s;uch a Variety of Colours, as are not to be equalled in any artificial Dyes or Tinctures. Sometimes I con&s;idered every Leaf as an elabo|rate Piece of Ti&s;&s;ue, in which the Threads and Fibres were woven together into different Confi|gurations, which gave a different Colouring to the Light as it glanced on the &s;everal Parts of the Surface. Sometimes I con&s;idered the whole Bed of Tulips, according to the Notion of the greate&s;t Mathematician and Philo&s;opher that ever lived, as a Multitude of Optick In&s;truments, de&s;igned for the &s;eparating Light into all tho&s;e various Co|lours of which it is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="140">
I was awakened out of the&s;e my Philo&s;ophical Speculations, by ob&s;erving the Company often &s;eemed to laugh at me. I accidentally prai&s;ed a Tulip as one of the fine&s;t that I ever &s;aw; upon which they told me, 'twas a common Fool's-Coat. Upon that I prai&s;ed a Second, which it &s;eems was but another Kind of Fool's-Coat. I had the &s;ame Fate with Two or Three more; for which Rea&s;on I de&s;ired the Owner of the Garden to let me know which were the fine&s;t of the Flowers, for that I was &s;o unskilful in the Art, that I thought the mo&s;t beautiful were the mo&s;t valua|ble, and that tho&s;e which had the gaye&s;t Colours were the mo&s;t beautiful. The Gentleman &s;miled at my Ignorance: He &s;eemed a very plain hone&s;t Man, and a Per&s;on of good Sen&s;e, had not his Head been touched with that Di&s;temper which <HI>Hippocrates</HI> calls the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Tulippomania;</HI> in&s;omuch that he would talk very rationally on any Subject in the World but a Tulip.</P>
<P>He told me, That he valued the Bed of Flowers which lay before us, and was not above Twenty Yards in Length, and Two in Breadth, more than he would the be&s;t Hundred Acres of Land in <HI>England;</HI> and added, That it would have been worth twice the Money it is, if a fooli&s;h Cook-Maid of his had not almo&s;t ruined him the la&s;t Winter, by mi&s;taking an Handful of Tulip-Roots for an Heap of Onions, and by that Means (&s;ays he) made me a Di&s;h of Porridge, that co&s;t me above 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling. He then &s;howed me what he thought the fine&s;t of his Tulips, which I found received all their Value from their Rarity and Oddne&s;s, and put me in Mind of your great For|tunes, which are not always the greate&s;t Beau|ties.</P>
<P>I have often looked upon it as a Piece of Hap|pine&s;s, that I have never fallen into any of the&s;e fanta&s;tical Ta&s;ts, nor e&s;teemed any Thing the more for its being uncommon and hard to be met

with. For this Rea&s;on, I look upon the whole Country in Spring-time as a &s;pacious Garden, and make as many Vi&s;its to a Spot of Daizies, or a Bank of Violets, as a Flori&s;t does to his Bor|ders and Parterres. There is not a Bu&s;h in Blo&s;|&s;om within a Mile of me which I am not ac|quainted with, nor &s;carce a Daffodil or Cow&s;lip that withers away in my Neighbourhood with|out my mi&s;&s;ing it. I walked Home in this Tem|per of Mind through &s;everal Fields and Meadows with an un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure, not without re|flecting on the Bounty of Providence, which has made the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and mo&s;t beautiful Ob|jects the mo&s;t ordinary and mo&s;t common.</P>

was &s;o irk&s;ome to me, that it &s;urpa&s;&s;es all other I ever knew, in&s;omuch that I cannot re|flect upon this Sorrow with Plea&s;ure, though it is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>An ea&s;y Manner of Conver&s;ation is the mo&s;t de&s;irable Quality a Man can have; and for that Rea&s;on Coxcombs will take upon them to be fa|miliar with People whom they never &s;aw before. What adds to the Vexation of it is, that they will act upon the Foot of knowing you by Fame, and rally with you, as they call it, by repeating what your Enemies &s;ay of you; and court you, as they think, by uttering to your Face at a wrong Time all the kind Things your Friends &s;peak of you in your Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The&s;e People are the more dreadful, the more they have of what is u&s;ually called Wit: For a lively Imagination, when it is not governed by a good Under&s;tanding, makes &s;uch mi&s;erable Ha|vock both in Conver&s;ation and Bu&s;ine&s;s, that it lays you defencele&s;s, and fearful to throw the lea&s;t Word in its Way, that may give it new Matter for its further Errors.</P>
<P><HI>Tom. Mercett</HI> has as quick a Fancy as any one li|ving; but there is no rea&s;onable Man can bear him half an Hour. His Purpo&s;e is to entertain, and it is of no Con&s;equence to him what is &s;aid, &s;o it be what is called well &s;aid; as if a Man mu&s;t bear a Wound with Patience, becau&s;e he that pu&s;hed at you came up with a good Air and Mien. That Part of Life which we &s;pend in Company, is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all our Mo|ments; and therefore I think our Behaviour in it &s;hould have its Laws as well as the Part of our Being, which is generally e&s;teemed the more im|portant. From hence it is, that from long Expe|rience I have made it a Maxim. that however we may pretend to take Satisfaction in &s;prightly Mirth and high Jollity, there is no great Plea&s;ure in any Company where the Ba&s;is of the Society
<PB N="133" REF="143">
is not mutual Good-Will. When this is in the Room, every trifling Circum&s;tance, the mo&s;t mi|nute Accident, the Ab&s;urdity of a Servant, the Repetition of an old Story, the Look of a Man when he is telling it, the mo&s;t indifferent and the mo&s;t ordinary Occurrences, are Matters which produce Mirth and good Humour. I went to &s;pend an Hour after this Manner with &s;ome Friends who enjoy it in Perfection whenever they meet, when tho&s;e De&s;troyers above-mentioned came in upon us. There is not a Man among them has any Notion of Di&s;tinction of Superiori|ty to one another, either in their Fortunes or their Talents, when they are in Company. Or if any Reflexion to the contrary occurs in their Thoughts, it only &s;trikes a Delight upon their Minds, that &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Power is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one whom they love and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In the&s;e my Lucubrations, I have frequently dwelt upon this one Topick. It would make &s;hort Work for us Reformers, for it is only Want of making this a Po&s;ition that renders &s;ome Cha|racters bad, which would otherwi&s;e be good. <HI>Tom Mercett</HI> means no Man Ill, but does Ill to every Body. His Ambition is to be witty; and to carry on that De&s;ign, he breaks through all Things that other People hold Sacred. If he thought Wit was no Way to be u&s;ed but to the Advantage of Society, that Sprightline&s;s would have a new Turn, and we &s;hould expect what he is going to &s;ay with Satisfaction in&s;tead of Fear. It is no Excu&s;e for being mi&s;chievous, that a Man is mi&s;chievous without Malice; nor will it be thought an Attonement that the Ill was done not to injure the Party concern'd, but to di|vert the Indifferent.</P>
<P>It is, methinks, a very great Error, that we &s;hould not profe&s;s Hone&s;ty in Conver&s;ation as much as in Commerce. If we con&s;ider, that there is no greater Misfortune than to be ill re|ceived
<PB N="134" REF="144">
where we love the turning a Man to Ridi|cule among his Friends, we rob him of greater Enjoyments than he could have purcha&s;ed by his Wealth; yet he that laughs at him, would per|haps be the la&s;t Man who would hurt him in this Ca&s;e of le&s;s Con&s;equence. It has been &s;aid, the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Don Quixote</HI> utterly de&s;troyed the Spi|rit of Gallantry in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation; and I be|lieve we may &s;ay much more truly, that the Hu|mour of Ridicule has done as much Injury to the true Reli&s;h of Company in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Such Satisfactions as ari&s;e from the &s;ecret Com|pari&s;on of our &s;elves to others, with relation to their inferior Fortunes or Merit, are mean and unworthy. The true and high State of Conver|&s;ation is when Men communicate their Thoughts to each other upon &s;uch Subjects, and in &s;uch a Manner, as would be plea&s;ant if there were no &s;uch Thing as Folly in the World; for it is but a low Condition of Wit in one Man which de|pends upon Folly in another.</P>
<P><HI>P.

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>Sept. 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAving received many Letters filled with Compliments and Acknowledgments for my late u&s;eful Di&s;covery of the Political Barome|ter, I &s;hall here communicate to the Publick an Account of my Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Thermometer, the latter giving as manife&s;t Progno&s;tications of the Changes and Revolutions in Church, as the for|mer does of tho&s;e in State, and both of them be|ing ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every prudent Subject who is re&s;olved to keep what he has, and get what he can.</P>
<P>The Church Thermometer, which I am now to treat of, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been invented in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, about the Time when that Religious Prince put &s;ome to Death for owning the Pope's Supremacy, and others for denying Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. I do not find, how|ever, any great U&s;e made of this In&s;trument till it fell into the Hands of a learned and vigilant Prie&s;t or Mini&s;ter, (for he frequently wrote him|&s;elf both one and the other) who was &s;ome Time Vicar of <HI>Bray.</HI> This Gentleman lived in his Vi|caridge to a good old Age; and after having &s;een &s;everal Succe&s;&s;ions of his neighbouring Clergy either burnt or bani&s;h'd, departed this Life with the Satisfaction of having never de&s;erted his
<PB N="137" REF="147">
Flock, and died Vicar of <HI>Bray.</HI> As this Gla&s;s was fir&s;t de&s;igned to calculate the different De|grees of Heat in Religion, as it raged in Popery, or as it cooled and grew temperate in the Refor|mation, it was marked at &s;everal Di&s;tances, after the Manner our ordinary Thermometer is to this Day, <HI>viz. Extream Hot &s;ultry Hot, very Hot, Hot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, ju&s;t Freezing, Fro&s;t, hard Fro&s;t, great Fro&s;t, extream Cold.</HI></P>
<P>It is well known, that <HI>Toricellius,</HI> the Inventor of the common Weather-Gla&s;s, made the Experi|ment in a long Tube which held Thirty two Foot of Water; and that a more modern Virtuo&s;o finding &s;uch a Machine altogether unweildy and u&s;ele&s;s, and con&s;idering that Thirty two Inches of Quick&s;ilver weigh'd as much as &s;o many Foot of Water in a Tube of the &s;ame Circumference, invented that fizeable In&s;trument which is now in U&s;e. After this Manner, that I might adapt the Thermometer I am now &s;peaking of to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of our Church, as divided into <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low,</HI> I have made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Vari|ations both in the Tube and the Fluid it contains. In the fir&s;t Place, I ordered a Tube to be ca&s;t in a Planetary Hour, and took Care to &s;eal it Her|metically, when the Sun was in Conjunction with <HI>Saturn.</HI> I then took the proper Precautions about the Fluid, which is a Compound of Two very different Liquors; one of them a Spirit drawn out of a &s;trong heady Wine; the other a parti|cular Sort of Rock Water, colder than Ice, and clearer than Chry&s;tal. The Spirit is of a red fiery Colour, and &s;o very apt to ferment, that unle&s;s it be mingled with a Proportion of the Water, or pent up very clo&s;e, it will bur&s;t the Ve&s;&s;el that holds it, and fly up in Fume and Smoak. The Water on the contrary is of &s;uch a &s;ubtle piercing Cold, that unle&s;s it be mingled with a Proportion of the Spirits, it will &s;ink through almo&s;t every Thing that it is put into, and &s;eems to be of the
<PB N="138" REF="148">
&s;ame Nature as the Water mentioned by <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> which, &s;ays the Hi&s;torian, could be con|tained in nothing but in the Hoof or (as the <HI>Ox|ford</HI> Manu&s;cript has it) in the Skull of an A&s;s. The Thermometer is marked according to the following Figure, which I &s;et down at length, not only to give my Reader a clear Idea of it, but al&s;o to fill up my Paper.<LIST>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Per&s;ecution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wrath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Zeal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHURCH.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Moderation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lukewarmne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Infidelity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Reader will ob&s;erve, that the Church is placed in the Middle Point of the Gla&s;s, between <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> the Situation in which &s;he always flouri&s;hes, and in which every good <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI> wi&s;hes her who is a Friend to the Con|&s;titution of his Country. However, when it mounts to <HI>Zeal,</HI> it is not ami&s;s; and when it &s;inks to <HI>Moderation,</HI> is &s;till in a mo&s;t admirable Temper. The wor&s;t of it is, that when once it begins to ri&s;e, it has &s;till an Inclination to a&s;cend, in&s;omuch that it is apt to climb from <HI>Zeal</HI> to <HI>Wrath,</HI> and from <HI>Wrath</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> which al|ways ends in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and very often proceeds from it. In the &s;ame Manner it frequently takes its Progre&s;s through the lower Half of the Gla&s;s; and when it has a Tendency to fall, will gradual|ly de&s;cend from <HI>Moderation</HI> to <HI>Lukewarmne&s;s,</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="149">
from <HI>Lukewarmne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Infidelity,</HI> which very often terminates in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and always proceeds from it.</P>
<P>It is a common Ob&s;ervation, that the ordinary Thermometer will be affected by the breathing of People who are in the Room where it &s;tands; and indeed, it is almo&s;t incredible to conceive how the Gla&s;s I am now de&s;cribing will fall by the Breath of a Multitude crying <HI>Popery;</HI> or on the contrary, how it will ri&s;e when the &s;ame Multi|tude (as it &s;ometimes happens) cry out in the &s;ame Breath, <HI>The Church is in Danger.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed this my Gla&s;s, and ad|ju&s;ted it to the above-mentioned Scale of Reli|gion, that I might make proper Experiments with it, I carried it under my Cloak to &s;everal Coffee-hou&s;es, and other Places of Re&s;ort about this great City. At St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, the Li|quor &s;tood at <HI>Moderation;</HI> but at <HI>Will</HI>'s, to my extream Surprize, it &s;ub&s;ided to the very lowe&s;t Mark on the Gla&s;s. At the <HI>Grecian,</HI> it mounted but ju&s;t one Point higher; at the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> it &s;till a&s;cended Two Decrees: <HI>Child</HI>'s fetched it up to <HI>Zeal,</HI> and other adjacent Coffee-hou&s;es to <HI>Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>It fell into the lower Half of the Gla&s;s as I went further into the City, till at length it &s;et|tled at <HI>Moderation,</HI> where it continued all the Time I &s;tay'd about the <HI>Change,</HI> as al&s;o whil&s;t I pa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Bank.</HI> And here I cannot but take Notice, that through the whole Cour&s;e of my Remarks, I never ob&s;erved my Gla&s;s to ri&s;e at the &s;ame Time that the Stocks did.</P>
<P>To compleat the Experiment, I prevailed upon a Friend of mine, who works under me in the Occult Sciences, to make a Progre&s;s with my Gla&s;s through the whole I&s;land of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> and after his Return, to pre&s;ent me with a Regi&s;ter of his Ob&s;ervations. I gue&s;&s;ed before|hand at the Temper of &s;everal Places he pa&s;&s;ed through, by the Characters they have had Time
<PB N="140" REF="150">
out of Mind. Thus that facetious Divine, Dr. <HI>Ful|ler,</HI> &s;peaking of the Town of <HI>Banbury</HI> near a Hundred Years ago, tells us, it was a Place fa|mous for Cakes and <HI>Zeal,</HI> which I find by my Gla&s;s is true to this Day as to the latter Part of this De&s;cription; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is not in the &s;ame Reputation for Cakes that it was in the Time of that learned Author; and thus of other Places. In &s;hort, I have now by me, di|ge&s;ted in an Alphabetical Order, all the Counties, Corporations and Boroughs, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with their re&s;pective Tempers, as they &s;tand re|lated to my Thermometer: But this I &s;hall keep to my &s;elf, becau&s;e I would by no Means do any Thing that may &s;eem to influence any en&s;uing Elections.</P>
<P>The Point of Doctrine which I would propa|gate by this my Invention, is the &s;ame which was long ago advanced by that able Teacher <HI>Ho|race,</HI> out of whom I have taken my Text for this Di&s;cour&s;e: We &s;hould be careful not to over|&s;hoot our &s;elves in the Pur&s;uits even of Virtue. Whether <HI>Zeal</HI> or <HI>Moderation</HI> be the Point we aim at, let us keep Fire out of the one, and Fro&s;t out of the other. But alas! the World is too Wi&s;e to want &s;uch a Precaution. The Terms <HI>High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church,</HI> as commonly u&s;ed, do not &s;o much denote a Principle, as they di&s;tin|gui&s;h a Party. They are like Words of Battle, that have nothing to do with their original Sig|nification, but are only given out to keep a Body of Men together, and to let them know Friends from Enemies.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have con&s;idered with &s;ome lit|tle Attention the Influence which the Opinions of the&s;e great National Sects have upon their Pra|ctice; and do look upon it as one of the unac|countable Things of our Times, that Multitudes of hone&s;t Gentlemen, who entirely agree in their
<PB N="141" REF="151">
Lives, &s;hould take it in their Heads to differ in their Religion.</P>

<P>AS I was this Morning going out of my Hou&s;e, a little Boy in a black Coat delivered to me the following Letter. Upon asking who he was, he told me, that he belonged to my Lady <HI>Gim|crack.</HI> I did not at fir&s;t recollect the Name; but upon Enquiry, found it to be the Widow of Sir <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who&s;e Legacy I lately gave &s;ome Account of to the World. The Letter ran thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to receive a Letter from the Widow <HI>Gimcrack.</HI> You know, Sir, that I have lately lo&s;t a very whim|&s;ical Husband, who I find, by one of your la&s;t Weeks Papers, was not altogether a Stranger to you. When I married this Gentleman, he had a very hand&s;ome E&s;tate; but upon buying a Set of Micro&s;copes, he was cho&s;en a Fellow of the Royal Society; from which Time I do not remember ever to have heard him &s;peak as other People did, or talk in a Manner that any of his Family could under&s;tand him. He u&s;ed, however, to pa&s;s away his Time very in|nocently in Conver&s;ation with &s;everal Mem|ber;
<PB N="142" REF="152">
of that learned Body; for which Rea&s;on I never advi&s;ed him again&s;t their Company for &s;everal Years, till at la&s;t I found his Brain was quite turned with their Di&s;cour&s;es. The fir&s;t Symptom which he di&s;covered of his being a Virtuo&s;o, as you call him, poor Man! was about Fifteen Years ago, when he gave me po&s;itive Orders to turn off an old Weeding-Woman that had been employed in the Family for &s;everal Years. He told me at the &s;ame Time, that there was no &s;uch Thing in Na|ture as a Weed, and that it was his De&s;ign to let his Garden produce what it plea&s;ed; &s;o that you may be &s;ure it makes a very plea&s;ant Show as it now lies. About the &s;ame Time he took a Humour to ramble up and down the Country, and would often bring Home with him his Pockets full of Mo&s;s and Pebbles. This you may be &s;ure gave me a heavy Heart; though at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, he had the Character of a very hone&s;t Man, notwith&s;tanding he was reckon'd a little weak, till he begun to &s;ell his E&s;tate, and buy tho&s;e &s;trange Baubles that you have taken Notice of. Upon <HI>Mid&s;ummer-Day</HI> la&s;t, as he was walking with me in the Fields, he &s;aw a very odd coloured Butterfly ju&s;t before us. I ob&s;erved, that he immediately chan|ged Colour, like a Man that is &s;urpri&s;ed with a Piece of good Luck, and telling me that it was what he had looked for above the&s;e Twelve Years, he threw off his Coat, and followed it. I lo&s;t Sight of them both in le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour; but my Husband continued the Chace over Hedge and Ditch till about Sun-&s;et; at which Time, as I was afterwards told, he caught the Butterfly, as &s;he re&s;ted her &s;elf upon a Cab|bage, near Five Miles from the Place where he fir&s;t put her up. He was here lifted
<PB N="143" REF="153">
from the Ground by &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers in a very fainting Condition, and brought Home to me about Midnight. His violent Exer|ci&s;e threw him into a Fever, which grew upon him by Degrees, and at la&s;t carried him off. In one of the Intervals of his Di|&s;temper, he called to me, and after having excu&s;ed him&s;elf for running out of his E|&s;tate, he told me, That he had always been more indu&s;trious to improve his Mind than his Fortune; and that his Family mu&s;t ra|ther value them&s;elves upon his Memory as he was a wi&s;e Man, than a rich one. He then told me, That it was a Cu&s;tom a|mong the <HI>Romans,</HI> for a Man to give his Slaves their Liberty when he lay upon his Death-Bed. I could not imagine what this meant, till after having a little compo&s;ed him&s;elf, he ordered me to bring him a Flea which he had kept for &s;everal Months in a Chain, with a De&s;ign, as he &s;aid, to give it its Ma|numi&s;&s;ion. This was done accordingly. He then made the Will, which I have &s;ince &s;een printed in your Works Word for Word. On|ly I mu&s;t take Notice, that you have omitted the Codicil, in which he left a large <HI>Concha Veneris,</HI> as it is there called, to a Member of the Royal Society, who was often with him in his Sickne&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his Will. And now, Sir, I come to the chief Bu|&s;ine&s;s of my Letter, which is, to de&s;ire your Friend&s;hip and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Di&s;po&s;al of tho&s;e many Rarities and Curio&s;ities which lie upon my Hands. If you know any one that has an Occa&s;ion for a Parcel of dry'd Spiders, I will &s;ell them a Pennyworth. I could like|wi&s;e let any one have a Bargain of Cockle-Shells. I would al&s;o de&s;ire your Advice, whe|ther I had be&s;t &s;ell my Beetles in a Lump, or by Retail. The Gentleman above-mentioned,
<PB N="144" REF="154">
who was my Husband's Friend, would have me make an Auction of all his Goods, and is now drawing up a Catalogue of every Particu|lar for that Purpo&s;e, with the Two following Words in great Letters over the Head of them, <HI>Auctio Gimcrackiana.</HI> But upon talking with him, I begin to &s;u&s;pect he is as mad as poor Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> was. Your Advice in all the&s;e Particulars, will be a great Piece of Charity to,</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am convinced by a late Paper of yours, that a pa&s;&s;ionate Woman (which among the common People goes under the Name of a Scold) is one of the mo&s;t un&s;upportable Creatures in the World.

<P>In An&s;wer to this mo&s;t unfortunate Lady, I mu&s;t acquaint her, That there is now in Town an ingenious Phy&s;ician of my Acquaintance, who undertakes to cure all the Vices and Defects of the Mind by inward Medicines, or outward Applica|tions. I &s;hall give the World an Account of his Patients and his Cures in other Papers, when I &s;hall be more at Lei&s;ure to treat upon this Subject. I &s;hall only here inform my Corre&s;pondent, That for the Benefit of &s;uch Ladies that are troubled with virulent Tongues, he has prepared a Cold Bath, over which there is fa&s;tened, at the End of a long Pole, a very convenient Chair, curiou&s;|ly gilt and carved. When the Patient is &s;eated in this Chair, the Doctor lifts up the Pole, and gives her Two or Three total Emer&s;ions in the Cold Bath, till &s;uch Time as &s;he has quite lo&s;t the U&s;e of Speech. This Operation &s;o effectually chills the Tongue, and refrigerates the Blood, that a Woman, who at her Entrance into the Chair is extreamly pa&s;&s;ionate and &s;onorous, will come out as &s;ilent and gentle as a Lamb. The Doctor told me, he would not practi&s;e this Expe|riment upon Women of Fa&s;hion, had not he &s;een it made upon tho&s;e of meaner Condition with very good Effect.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>September 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas by Letters from <HI>Nottingham</HI> we have Advice, That the young Ladies of that Place complain for Want of Sleep, by rea|&s;on of certain riotous Lovers, who for this la&s;t Summer have very much infe&s;ted the Streets of that eminent City with Violins and Ba&s;s-Viols, between the Hours of Twelve and Four in the Morning, to the great Di&s;turbance of many of Her Maje&s;ty's peaceable Subjects. And whereas I have been im|portuned to publi&s;h &s;ome Edict again&s;t the&s;e Mid|night Alarms, which, under the Name of Sere|nades, do greatly annoy many well-di&s;po&s;ed Per|&s;ons, not only in the Place above-mentioned, but al&s;o in mo&s;t of the Polite Towns of this I&s;land.</P>
<P>I have taken that Matter into my &s;erious Con|&s;ideration, and do find, that this Cu&s;tom is by no means to be indulged in this Country and Cli|mate.</P>
<P>It is indeed very unaccountable, that mo&s;t of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Youth &s;hould take &s;uch great Delight in the&s;e Nocturnal Expeditions. Your robu&s;t true-born <HI>Briton,</HI> that has not yet felt the Force of Flames and Darts, has a natural Inclination to break Windows; while th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who&s;e natural Rug|gedne&s;s has been &s;oothed and &s;oftened by gentle Pa&s;&s;ion, have as &s;trong a Propen&s;ity to langui&s;h under them, e&s;pecially if they have a Fidler be|hind
<PB N="147" REF="157">
them to utter their Complaints: For as the Cu&s;tom prevails at pre&s;ent, there is &s;carce a young Man of any Fa&s;hion in a Corporation who does not make Love with the Town-Mu&s;ick. The Waits often help him through his Court&s;hip; and my Friend Mr. <HI>Bani&s;ter</HI> has told me, he was proffered Five hundred Pounds by a young Fellow to play, but for one Winter under the Window of a Lady that was a great Fortune, but more cruel than or|dinary. One would think they hoped to conquer their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Hearts as People tame Hawks and Eagles, by keeping them awake, or breaking their Sleep when they are fallen into it.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to &s;earch into the Original of this impertinent Way of making Love, which, according to &s;ome Authors, is of great Anti|quity. If we may believe Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier and</HI> other Criticks, <HI>Horace</HI>'s Tenth Ode of the Third Book was originally a Serenade. And if I was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;how my Learning, I could produce a Line of him in another Place, which &s;eems to have been the Burthen of an old Heathen Sere|nade.</P>
<Q><L>" &mdash; Audis minus &amp; minus jam</L>
<L>Me tuo tongas pereunte Noctes,</L>
<L>Lydia, Dormis?</L></Q>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the Opinions of many lear|ned Men upon this Subject, I rather agree with them who look upon this Cu&s;tom, as now practi|&s;ed, to have been introduced by ca&s;trated Mu&s;ici|ans, who found out this Way of applying them|&s;elves to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at the&s;e Hours, when Men of hoar&s;er Voices expre&s;s their Pa&s;&s;ions in a more vulgar Method. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, That your <HI>Italian</HI> Eunuchs do practi&s;e this Manner of Court|&s;hip to this Day.</P>
<P>But whoever were the Per&s;ons that fir&s;t thought of the Serenade, the Authors of all Countries are unanimous in a&s;cribing the invention to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158">
There are Two Circum&s;tances which qualified that Country above all other for this Midnight Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention, was the Softne&s;s of their Climate.</P>
<P>This gave the Lover Opportunities of being Abroad in the Air, or of lying upon the Earth whole Hours together, without Fear of Damps or Dews; but as for our Tramontain Lovers, when they begin their Midnight Complaint with,
<Q><L>My Lodging it is on the cold Ground,</L></Q> We are not to under&s;tand them in the Rigour of the Letter, &s;ince it would be impo&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Swain to condole him&s;elf long in that Situa|tion without really dying for his Mi&s;tre&s;s. A Man might as well &s;erenade in <HI>Greenland</HI> as in our Re|gion. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;eems to have had in his Thoughts the Ab&s;urdity of the&s;e Northern Serenades in the Cen&s;ure which he pa&s;&s;es upon them:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Or Midnight Ball,</L>
<L>Or Serenede, which the Starv'd Lover &s;ings</L>
<L>To his proud Fair, be&s;t quitted with Di&s;dain.</L></Q>
<P>The Truth of it is, I have often pitied, in a Win|ter Night, a Vocal Mu&s;ician, and have attributed many of his Trills and Quavers to the Coldne&s;s of the Weather.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Circum&s;tance which inclined the <HI>Lalians</HI> to this Cu&s;tom, was that Mu&s;ical Genius which is &s;o univer&s;al among them. Nothing is more frequent in that Country, than to hear a Cobler working to an Opera Tune. You can &s;carce &s;ee a Porter that has not one Nail much longer than the re&s;t, which you will find, upon Enquiry, is cheri&s;hed for &s;ome In&s;trument. In &s;hort, there is not a Labourer, or Handicraft Man, that in the Cool of the Evening does not relieve him&s;elf with Solo's and Sonnata's.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="159">
The <HI>Italian</HI> fooths his Mi&s;tre&s;s with a plaintivee Voice, and bewails him&s;elf in &s;uch melting Mu|&s;ick, that the whole Neighbourhood &s;ympathizes with him in his Sorrow.</P>

<P>On the contrary, our hone&s;t Countrymen have &s;o little an Inclination to Mu&s;ick, that they &s;el|dom begin to &s;ing till they are drunk, which al&s;o is u&s;ually the Time when they are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erenade.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>September 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been very much &s;ollicited by <HI>Cla|rinda, Flavia,</HI> and <HI>Ly&s;etta,</HI> to rea&s;&s;ume my Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Methods of di&s;po&s;ing honourably the unmarried Part of the World, and taking off tho&s;e Bars to it, Jointures and Settle|ments, which are not only the greate&s;t Impedi|ments towards entring into that State, but al&s;o the frequent Cau&s;es of Di&s;tur&s;t and Animo&s;ity in it after it is con&s;ummated. I have with very much Attention con&s;ider'd the Ca&s;e; and among all the
<PB N="150" REF="160">
Ob&s;ervations that I have made thro' a long Cour&s;e of Years, I have thought the Coldne&s;s of Wives to their Husbands, as well as Di&s;re&s;pect from Chil|dren to Parents, to ari&s;e from this one Source. This Trade for Minds and Bodies in the Lump, without Regard to either, but as they are accom|panied with &s;uch Sums of Money, and &s;uch Par|ceis of Land, cannot but produce a Commerce between the Parties concerned &s;uitable to the mean Motives upon which they at fir&s;t came to|gether. I have heretofore given an Account, that this Method of making Settlements, was fir&s;t in|vented by a griping Lawyer, who made U&s;e of the covetous Tempers of the Parents of each Side to force Two young People into the&s;e vile Mea|&s;ures of Diffidence, for no other End but to en|crea&s;e the Skins of Parchment, by which they were put into each other's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion out of each other's Power. The Law of our Country has given an ample and generous Provi&s;ion for the Wife, even the Third of the Husband's E&s;tate, and left to her good Humour and his Gratitude the Expectation of further Provi&s;ion; but the fanta&s;ti|cal Method of going further, with relation to their Heirs, has a Foundation in nothing but Pride and Folly: For as all Men wi&s;h their Children as like them&s;elves, and as much better as they can po&s;&s;i|bly, it &s;eems mon&s;trous, that we &s;hould give out of our &s;elves the Opportunities of rewarding and di&s;couraging them according to their De&s;erts. This wi&s;e In&s;titution has no more Sen&s;e in it, than if a Man &s;hould begin a Deed with, <Q REND="inline">"Whereas no Man living knows how long he &s;hall conti|nue to be a rea&s;onable Creature, or an hone&s;t Man: And whereas I <HI>B.</HI> am going to enter in the State of Matrimony with Mrs. <HI>D.</HI> therefore I &s;hall from henceforth make it indifferent to me, whether from this Time forward I &s;hall be a Fool or a Knave: And therefore in full and per|fect
<PB N="151" REF="161">
Health of Body, and as &s;ound Mind, not knowing which of my Children will prove bet|ter or wor&s;e, I give to my Fir&s;t-born, be he per|ver&s;e, ungrateful, impious, or cruel, the Lump and Bulk of my E&s;tate, and leave one Year's Purcha&s;e only to each of my younger Children, whether they &s;hall be brave or beautiful, mode&s;t or honourable, from the Time of the Date hereof wherein I re&s;ign my Sen&s;es, and hereby promi&s;e to employ my Judgment no further in the Di|&s;tribution of my Worldly Goods from the Day of the Date hereof, hereby further confe&s;&s;ing and covenanting, that I am from henceforth married, and dead in Law.'</Q></P>
<P>There is no Man that is conver&s;ant in modern Settlements, but knows this is an exact Tran&s;la|tion of what is in&s;erted in the&s;e In&s;truments. Men's Pa&s;&s;ions could only make them &s;ubmit to &s;uch Terms; and therefore all unrea&s;onable Bar|gains in Marriage ought to be &s;et a&s;ide, as well as Deeds extorted from Men under Force or in Pri&s;on, who are altogether as much Ma&s;ters of their Actions as he that is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a violent Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>How &s;trangely Men are &s;ometimes partial to them&s;elves, appears by the Rapine of him that has a Daughter's Beauty under his Direction. He will make no Scruple of u&s;ing it to force from her Lo|ver as much of his E&s;tate as is worth 10000 <HI>l.</HI> and at the &s;ame Time, as a Ju&s;tice on the Bench, will &s;pare no Pains to get a Man hanged that has taken but a Hor&s;e from him.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, the Legi&s;lature will in due Time take this Kind of Robbery into Con&s;idera|tion, and not &s;uffer Men to prey upon each other, when they are about making the mo&s;t &s;olemn League, and entring into the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds. The only &s;ure Remedy is to fix a certain Rate on every Woman's Fortune; one Price for that of a Maid,
<PB N="152" REF="162">
and another for a Widow: For it is of infinite Advantage, that there &s;hould be no Frauds or Un|certainties in the Sale of our Women.</P>
<P>If any Man &s;hould exceed the &s;ettled Rate, he ought to be at Liberty after Seven Years are over, by which Time his Love may be &s;uppo&s;ed to abate a little, if it is not founded upon Rea&s;on, to re|nounce the Bargain, and be freed from the Settle|ment upon re&s;toring the Portion; as a Youth mar|ried under Fourteen Years old may be off if he plea&s;es when he comes to that Age, and as a Man is di&s;charged from all Bargains but that of Mar|riage made when he is under Twenty one.</P>
<P>It grives me when I con&s;ider, that the&s;e Re|&s;traints upon Matrimony take away the Advan|tage we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have over other Coun|tries, which are &s;unk much by tho&s;e great Checks upon Propagation, the Convents. It is thought chiefly owing to the&s;e that <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> want above half their Complement of People. Were the Price of Wives always fixed and &s;ettled, it would contribute to filling the Nation more than all the Encouragements that can po&s;&s;ibly be given to Fo|reigners to tran&s;plant them&s;elves hither.</P>
<P>I therefore, as Cen&s;or of <HI>Britain,</HI> till a Law is made, will lay down Rules which &s;hall be ob&s;er|ved with Penalty of degrading all that break them into Pretty Fellows, Smarts, Squibs, Hunt|ing Horns, Drums, and Bagpipes.</P>
<P>The Females that are guilty of breaking my Orders, I &s;hall re&s;pectively pronounce to be Kits, Hornpipes, Dulcimers, and Kettle-Drums. Such Widows as wear the Spoils of one Husband I will bury, if they attempt to rob another.</P>
<P>I ordain, That no Woman ever demand one Shilling to be paid after her Husband's Death, more than the very Sum &s;he brings him, or an Equivalent for it in Land.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="163">
That no Settlement be made, in which the Man &s;ettles on his Children more than the Rever&s;ion of the Jointure, or the Value of it in Money; &s;o that at his Death he may in the Whole be bound to pay his Family but double to what he has receiv'd. I would have the elde&s;t, as well as the re&s;t, have his Provi&s;ion out of this.</P>
<P>When Men are not able to come up to tho&s;e Settlements I have propo&s;ed, I would have them receive &s;o much of the Portion only as they can come up to, and the re&s;t to go to the Woman by Way of Pin-Money, or Separate Maintenance. In this, I think, I determined equally between the Two Sexes.</P>
<P>If any Lawyer varies from the&s;e Rules, or is above Two Days in drawing a Marriage Settle|ment, or u&s;es more Words in it than one Skin of Parchment will contain, or takes above Five Pounds for drawing it, I would have him thrown over the Bar.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e Rules ob&s;erved, a Woman with a &s;mall Fortune, and a great deal of Worth, would be &s;ure to marry according to her De&s;erts, if the Man's E&s;tate were to be le&s;s incumbered in Pro|portion as her Fortune is le&s;s than he might have with others.</P>
<P>A Man of a great deal of Merit, and not much E&s;tate, might be cho&s;en for his Worth; becau&s;e it would not be difficult for him to make a Settle|ment.</P>
<P>The Man that loves a Woman be&s;t, would not lo&s;e her for not being able to bid &s;o much as ano|ther, or for not complying with an extravagant Demand.</P>
<P>A fine Woman would no more be &s;et up to Auction as &s;he is now. When a Man puts in for her, her Friends or her &s;elf take Care to publi&s;h it; and the Man that was the fir&s;t Bidder is made no other U&s;e of but to rai&s;e the Price. He that
<PB N="154" REF="164">
loves her, will continue in Waiting as long as &s;he plea&s;es, (if her Fortune be thought equal to his) and under Pretence of &s;ome Failure in the Rent-Roll, or Difficulties in drawing the Settlement, he is put off till a better Bargain is made with ano|ther.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the Sex that are not rich or beau|tiful to the highe&s;t Degree are plainly Gainers, and would be married &s;o fa&s;t, that the lea&s;t charm|ing of them would &s;oon grow Beauties to the Bat|chelors.</P>
<P>Widows might be ea&s;ily married, if they would not, as they do now, &s;et up for di&s;creet, only by being mercenary.</P>
<P>The making Matimony cheap and ea&s;y, would be the greate&s;t Di&s;couragement to Vice: The li|miting the Expence of Children would not make Men ill inclined, or afraid of having them in a regular Way; and the Men of Merit would not live unmarried, as they often do now, becau&s;e the Goodne&s;s of a Wife cannot be en&s;ured to them; out the Lo&s;s of an E&s;tate is certain, and a Man would never have the Affliction of a worthle&s;s Heir added to that of a bad Wife.</P>
<P>I am the more &s;erious, large, and particular on this Subject, becau&s;e my Lucubrations de&s;igned for the Encouragement of Virtue, cannot have the de&s;ired Succe&s;s as long as this Incumbrance of Set|tlements continues upon Matrimony.</P>

<P>IT is my Cu&s;tom, in a Dearth of News, to en|tertain my &s;elf with tho&s;e Collections of Ad|verti&s;ements that appear at the End of all our publick Prints. The&s;e I con&s;ider as Accounts of News from the little World, in the &s;ame Manner that the foregoing Parts of the Paper are from the great. If in one we hear that a Sovereign Prince is fled from his Capital City, in the other we hear of a Trade&s;man who hath &s;hut up his Shop, and run away. If in one we find the Victory of a General, in the other we &s;ee the De&s;ertion of a private Soldier. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have a certain Weakne&s;s in my Temper, that is often very much affected by the&s;e little Dome&s;tick Occurrences, and have frequently been caught with Tears in my Eyes over a melancholy Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider this Subject in its mo&s;t ridicu|lous Lights, Adverti&s;ements are of great U&s;e to the Vulgar: Fir&s;t of all, as they are In&s;truments of Ambition. A Man that is by no Means big enough for the <HI>Gazette,</HI> may ea&s;ily creep into the Adverti&s;ements; by which Means we often &s;ee an Apothecary in the &s;ame Paper of News with a Plenipotentiary, or a Running-Footman with an Amba&s;&s;ador. An Adverti&s;ement from <HI>Pickadilly</HI> goes down to Po&s;terity, with an Article from <HI>Ma|drid;</HI> and <HI>John Bartlett</HI> of <HI>Goodman's-Fields</HI> is ce|lebrated in the &s;ame Paper with the Emperor of
<PB N="156" REF="166">
<HI>Germany.</HI> Thus the Fable tells us, That the Wren mounted as high as the Eagle, by getting upon his Back.</P>
<P>A Second U&s;e which this Sort of Writings have been turned to of late Years, has been the Manage|ment of Controver&s;y, in&s;omuch that above half the Adverti&s;ements one meets with now-a-Days are purely Polemical. The Inventors of <HI>Strops for Razors</HI> have written again&s;t one another this Way for &s;everal Years, and that with great Bitterne&s;s; as the whole Argument <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Morning-Gowns</HI> is &s;till carried on after the &s;ame Manner. I need not mention the &s;everal Proprie|tors of Dr. <HI>Ander&s;on</HI>'s Pills; nor take Notice of the many Satyrical Works of this Nature &s;o fre|quently publi&s;hed by Dr. <HI>Clark,</HI> who has had the Confidence to adverti&s;e upon that learned Knight, my very worthy Friend, Sir <HI>William Read:</HI> But I &s;hall not interpo&s;e in their Quarrel; Sir <HI>William</HI> can give him his own in Adverti&s;ements, that, in the Judgment of the Impartial, are as well penn'd as the Doctor's.</P>
<P>The Third and la&s;t U&s;e of the&s;e Writings is, to inform the World where they may be furni&s;hed with almo&s;t every Thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for Life. If a Man has Pains in his Head, Cholicks in his Bowels, or Spots in his Clothes, he may here meet with proper Cures and Remedies. If a Man would recover a Wife or a Hor&s;e that is &s;tolen or &s;tray'd; if he wants new Sermons, Electuaries, A&s;&s;es Milk, or any Thing el&s;e, either for his Body or his Mind, this is the Place to look for them in.</P>
<P>The great Art in writing Adverti&s;ements, is the finding out a proper Method to catch the Reader's Eye; without which, a good Thing may pa&s;s over unob&s;erved, or be lo&s;t among Commi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupt. A&s;terisks and Hands were formerly of great U&s;e for this Purpo&s;e. Of late Years, the <HI>N. B.</HI> has been much in Fa&s;hion; as al&s;o little Cuts and Figures, the Invention of which we mu&s;t a|&s;cribe
<PB N="157" REF="167">
to the Author of Spring-Tru&s;&s;es. I mu&s;t not here omit the blind <HI>Italian</HI> Character, which be|ing &s;carce legible, always fixes and detains the Eye, and gives the curious Reader &s;omething like the Satisfaction of prying into a Secret.</P>
<P>But the great Skill in an Adverti&s;er is chiefly &s;een in the Style which he makes u&s;e of. He is to mention <HI>the univer&s;al E&s;teem, or general Reputa|tion,</HI> of Things that were never heard of. If he is a Phy&s;ician or A&s;trologer, he mu&s;t change his Lodgings frequently, and (tho' he never &s;aw any Body in them be&s;ides his own Family) give pub|lick Notice of it, <HI>For the Information of the Nobility and Gentry.</HI> Since I am thus u&s;efully employ'd in writing Critici&s;ms on the Works of the&s;e diminu|tive Authors, I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in Silence an Adverti&s;ement which has lately made its Appea|rance, and is written altogether in a <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Manner. It was &s;ent to me, with Five Shillings, to be in&s;erted among my Adverti&s;ements; but as it is a Pattern of good Writing in this Way, I &s;hall give it a Place in the Body of my Paper.</P>

excu&s;e my Fellow-Labourers for admitting into their Papers &s;everal uncleanly Adverti&s;ements, not at all proper to appear in the Works of polite Wri|ters. Among the&s;e I mu&s;t reckon the <HI>Carminitive Wind expelling</HI> Pills. If the Doctor had called them only his Carminitive Pills, he had been as cleanly as one could have wi&s;hed; but the Second Word entirely de&s;troys the Decency of the Fir&s;t.

<P>By the Remarks I have here made, it plainly ap|pears, that a Collection of Adverti&s;ements is a kind of Mi&s;cellany; the Writers of which, contra|ry to all Authors, except Men of Quality, give Money to the Book&s;ellers who publi&s;h their Co|pies.

<P>THE Hours which we &s;pend in Conver&s;ation are the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of any which we en|joy; yet, methinks, there is very little Care ta|ken to improve our &s;elves for the frequent Repe|tition of them. The common Fault in this Ca&s;e, is that of growing too intimate, and falling into di&s;plea&s;ing Familiarities: For it is a very ordinary Thing for Men to make no other U&s;e of a clo&s;e Acquaintance with each other's Affairs, but to teaze one another with unacceptable Allu&s;ions. One would pa&s;s over patiently &s;uch as conver&s;e like Animals, and &s;alute each other with Bangs on the Shoulder, &s;ly Raps with Canes, or other robu&s;t Plea&s;antries practi&s;ed by the rural Gentry of this Nation: But even among tho&s;e who &s;hould have more polite Idea's of Things, you &s;ee a Set of People who invert the De&s;ign of Conver&s;a|tion, and make frequent Mention of ungrateful Subjects; nay, mention them becau&s;e they are ungrateful; as if the Perfection of Society were in knowing how to offend on the one Part, and how to bear an Offence on the other. In all Parts of this populous Town you find the merry World made up of an active and a pa&s;&s;ive Companion; one who has good-nature enough to &s;uffer all his Friend &s;hall think fit to &s;ay, and one who is re|&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of his Good-humour to &s;how his Parts. In the Trading Part of Mankind,
<PB N="160" REF="170">
I have ever ob&s;erved the Je&s;t went by the Weight of Pur&s;es, and the Ridicule is made up by the Gains which ari&s;e from it. Thus the Packer al|lows the Clothier to &s;ay what he plea&s;es, and the Broker has his Countenance ready to laugh with the Merchant, tho' the Abu&s;e is to fall on him|&s;elf, becau&s;e he knows that, as a Go-between, he &s;hall find his Account in being in the good Graces of a Man of Wealth. Among the&s;e ju&s;t and punctual People, the riche&s;t Man is ever the bet|ter Je&s;ter; and they know no &s;uch Thing as a Per&s;on who &s;hall pretend to a &s;uperior Laugh at a Man, who does not make him Amends by Op|portunities of Advantage in another Kind: But among People of a different Way, where the pretended Di&s;tinction in Company is only what is rai&s;ed from Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding, it is very ab&s;urd to carry on a rough Raillery &s;o far, as that the whole Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould turn upon each others Infirmities, Follies, or Misfortunes.</P>
<P>I was this Evening with a Set of Wags of this Cla&s;s. They appear generally by Two and Two; and what is mo&s;t extraordinary, is, that tho&s;e very Per&s;ons who are mo&s;t together, appear lea&s;t of a Mind when joined by other Company. This Evil proceeds from an indi&s;creet Familiarity, whereby a Man is allowed to &s;ay the mo&s;t gra|ting Thing imaginable to another, and it &s;hall be accounted Weakne&s;s to &s;how an Impatience for the Unkindne&s;s. But this and all other Devia|tions from the De&s;ign of plea&s;ing each other when we meet, are derived from Interlopers in Society, who want Capacity to put in a Stock among re|gular Companions, and therefore &s;upply their Wants by &s;tale Hi&s;tories, &s;ly Ob&s;ervations, and rude Hints, which relate to the Conduct of others. All Cohabitants in general run into this unhappy Fault; Men and their Wives break into Re|flections, which are like &s;o much <HI>Arabick</HI> to the re&s;t of the Company; Si&s;ters and Brothers often
<PB N="161" REF="171">
make the like Figure from the &s;ame unju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Art of being intimate and familiar. It is often &s;aid, &s;uch an one cannot &s;tand the Mention of &s;uch a Circum&s;tance: If he cannot, I am &s;ure it is for Want of Di&s;cour&s;e, or a wor&s;e Rea&s;on, that any Companion of his touches upon it.</P>
<P>Familiarity, among the truly Well-bred, never give Authority to tre&s;pa&s;s upon one another in the mo&s;t minute Circum&s;tance, but it allows to be kinder than we ought otherwi&s;e pre&s;ume to be. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> has Wit, Humour, and Spirit; but there never was a Man in his Company who wi&s;hed he had le&s;s, for he under&s;tands Familiarity &s;o well, that he knows how to make U&s;e of it in a Way that neither makes him&s;elf or his Friend con|temptible; but if any one is le&s;&s;ened by his Free|dom, it is he him&s;elf, who always likes the Place, the Diet, and the Reception, when he is in the Company of his Friends. Equality is the Life of Conver&s;ation; and he is as much out who a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf any Part above another, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf below the re&s;t of the Society. Familiarity in Inferiors is Saucine&s;s; in Superiors, Conde&s;cen&s;ion; neither of which are to have Being among Companions, the very Word implying that they are to be equal. When therefore we have ab&s;tracted the Company from all Con&s;iderations of their Quality or Fortune, it will immediately appear, that to make it happy and polite, there mu&s;t nothing be &s;tarted which &s;hall di&s;cover that our Thoughts run upon any &s;uch Di&s;tinctions. Hence it will ari&s;e, that Be|nevolence mu&s;t become the Rule of Society, and he that is mo&s;t obliging, mu&s;t be mo&s;t diverting.</P>
<P>This Way of Talking I am fallen into from the Reflection that I am wherever I go entertained with &s;ome Ab&s;urdity, Mi&s;take, Weakne&s;s, or ill Luck of &s;ome Man or other, whom not only I, but the Per&s;on who makes me tho&s;e Relations has a Value for. It would therefore be a great Be|nefit
<PB N="162" REF="172">
to the World, if it could be brought to pa&s;s that no Story &s;hould be a taking one, but what was to the Advantage of the Per&s;on of whom it is related. By this Means, he that is now a Wit in Conver&s;ation, would be con&s;idered as a Sprea|der of fal&s;e News is in Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But above all, to make a Familiar fit for a Bo|&s;om Friend, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould always be inclined rather to hide than rally each others Infirmities. To &s;uffer for a Fault, is a Sort of Attonement; and no Body is concerned for the Offence for which he has made Repara|tion.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I have received the following Letter, which rallies me for being witty &s;ooner than I de&s;igned; but I have now altered my Re&s;olution, and intend to be facetious till the Day in <HI>October</HI> heretofore mentioned, in&s;tead of beginning for that Day.</P>

<P>IT is one of the De&s;igns of this Paper to tran&s;|mit to Po&s;terity an Account of every Thing that is mon&s;trous in my own Times.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here make bold to trouble you with a &s;hort Account of the famous Dr. <HI>Young</HI>'s Life, which you may call (if you plea&s;e) a Second Part of the Farce of the <HI>Sham Doctor.</HI> This perhaps will not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to you, who (if I am not mi&s;taken) have &s;omewhere men|tioned with Honour your Si&s;ter <HI>Kirleus</HI> as a Practitioner both in Phy&s;ick and A&s;trology: But in the common Opinion of Mankind, a She-Quack is altogether as &s;trange and a&s;toni&s;hing a Creature as the Centaur that practis'd Phy&s;ick in the Days of <HI>Achilles,</HI> or as King <HI>Phys</HI> in the <HI>Rehear&s;al. Ae&s;culapius,</HI> the great Founder of your Art, was particularly famous for his Beard, as we may conclude from the Behaviour of a Tyrant, who is branded by Heathen Hi&s;to|rians as guilty both of Sacrilege and Bla&s;phe|my, having robbed the Statue of <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> of a thick bu&s;hy Golden Beard, and then alledged for his Excu&s;e, <HI>That it was a Shame the Son &s;hould have a Beard when his Father</HI> Apollo <HI>had none.</HI> This latter In&s;tance indeed &s;eems &s;ome|thing to favour a Female Profe&s;&s;or, &s;ince (as I have been told) the ancient Statues of <HI>Apollo</HI> are generally made with the Head and Face of a Woman: Nay, I have been credibly informed by tho&s;e who have &s;een them both, that the famous <HI>Apollo</HI> in the <HI>Belvidera</HI> did very much re|&s;emble Dr. <HI>Young.</HI> Let that be as it will, the Doctor was a Kind of <HI>Amazon</HI> in Phy&s;ick, that made as great Deva&s;tations and Slaughters as any of our chief Heroes in the Art, and was as fatal to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the&s;e our Days, as the famous <HI>Jean d' Arc</HI> was in tho&s;e of our Forefathers.</P>
<P>I do not find any Thing remarkable in the Life I am about to write till the Year 1695, at
<PB N="165" REF="175">
which Time the Doctor, being about Twenty three Years old, was brought to Bed of a Ba|&s;tard Child. The Scandal of &s;uch a Misfor|tune gave &s;o great Unea&s;ine&s;s to pretty Mrs. <HI>Peg|gy,</HI> (for that was the Name by which the Doctor was then called) that &s;he left her Fami|ly, and followed her Lover to <HI>London,</HI> with a fixed Re&s;olution &s;ome Way or other to recover her lo&s;t Reputation: But in&s;tead of changing her Life, which one would have expected from &s;o good a Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, &s;he took it in her Head to change her Sex. This was &s;oon done by the Help of a Sword and a Pair of Breeches. I have Rea&s;on to believe, that her fir&s;t De&s;ign was to turn Man-Midwife, having her &s;elf had &s;ome Experience in tho&s;e Affairs: But thinking this too narrow a Foundation for her future Fortune, &s;he at length bought her a Gold Button Coat, and &s;et up for a Phy&s;ician. Thus we &s;ee the &s;ame fatal Mi&s;carriage in her Youth made Mrs. <HI>Young</HI> a Doctor, that former|ly made one of the &s;ame Sex a Pope.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ucceeded very well in his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s at fir&s;t, but very often met with Accidents that di&s;quieted him. As he wanted that deep magi&s;terial Voice which gives Authority to a Pre&s;cription, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the right Pronouncing of tho&s;e Words, <HI>Take the&s;e Pills,</HI> he unfortunately got the Nickname of the <HI>Squeaking Doctor.</HI> If this Circum&s;tance alarmed the Doctor, there was another that gave him no &s;mall Di&s;quiet, and very much dimini&s;hed his Gains. In &s;hort, he found him|&s;elf run down as a &s;uperficial prating Quack, in all Families that had at the Head of them a cautious Father, or a jealous Husband. The&s;e would often complain among one another, that they did not like &s;uch a Smock-faced Phy&s;ician; though in Truth had they known how ju&s;tly he de&s;erved that Name, they would rather have
<PB N="166" REF="176">
favoured his Practice, than have apprehended any Thing from it.</P>
<P>Such were the Motives that determined Mrs. <HI>Young</HI> to change her Condition, and take in Marriage a virtuous young Woman, who lived with her in good Reputation, and made her the Father of a very pretty Girl. But this Part of her Happine&s;s was &s;oon after de&s;troyed by a Di&s;temper which was too hard for our Phy&s;ician, and carried off his fir&s;t Wife. The Doctor had not been a Widow long, before he married his Second Lady, with whom al&s;o he lived in very good Under&s;tanding. It &s;o hap|pened, that the Doctor was with Child at the &s;ame Time that his Lady was; but the little ones coming both together, they pa&s;&s;ed for Twins. The Doctor having entirely e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the Reputation of his Manhood, e&s;pecially by the Birth of the Boy of whom he had been lately delivered, and who very much re&s;embles him, grew into good Bu&s;ine&s;s, and was particu|larly famous for the Cure of Venereal Di&s;tem|pers; but would have had much more Practice among his own Sex, had not &s;ome of them been &s;o unrea&s;onable as to demand certain Proofs of their Cure, which the Doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming Look, which gave the Doctor &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s at fir&s;t, in|&s;tead of betraying his Per&s;on, only recommend|ed his Phy&s;ick. Upon this Occa&s;ion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very a|greeable Surprize in one of <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays, where a young Woman applies her &s;elf to a &s;ick Per&s;on in the Habit of a Quack, and &s;peaks to her Patient, who was &s;omething &s;candalized at the Youth of his Phy&s;ician, to the following Purpo&s;e&mdash;<HI>I begun to practi&s;e in the Reign of</HI> Francis I. <HI>and am now in the Hundred and fifti|eth Year of my Age; but, by the Vertue of my Medicaments, have maintained my &s;elf in the</HI>

<HI>&s;ame Beauty and Fre&s;hne&s;s I had at Fifteen.</HI> For this Rea&s;on <HI>Hippocrates</HI> lays it down as a Rule, That a Student in Phy&s;ick &s;hould have a &s;ound Con&s;titution, and a healthy Look; which in|deed &s;eem as nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications for a Phy&s;ician, as a good Life, and virtuous Beha|viour, for a Divine. But to return to our Sub|ject. About Two Years ago the Doctor was very much afflicted with the Vapours, which grew upon him to &s;uch a Degree, that about &s;ix Weeks &s;ince they made an End of him. His Death di&s;covered the Di&s;gui&s;e he had acted un|der, and brought him back again to his former Sex. 'Tis &s;aid, that at his Burial the Pall was held up by Six Women of &s;ome Fa&s;hion. The Doctor left behind him a Widow, and Two Fa|therle&s;s Children, if they may be called &s;o, be|&s;ides the little Boy before-mentioned. In rela|tion to whom we may &s;ay of the Doctor, as the good old Ballad about <HI>The Children in the Wood</HI> &s;ays of the Unnatural Unkle, that he was Father and Mother both in one. The&s;e are all the Circum&s;tances that I could learn of Doctor <HI>Young</HI>'s Life, which might have given Occa&s;ion to many ob&s;cene Fictions: But as I know tho&s;e would never have gained a Place in your Paper, I have not troubled you with any Impertinence of that Nature; having &s;tuck to the Truth ve|ry &s;crupulou&s;ly, as I always do when I &s;ub|&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<P>IT is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy to &s;ooth and allay the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind, or turn them to a vigorous Pro&s;ecution of what is dictated by the Under&s;tanding.

I have now under Cure a young Gentleman, who lately communicated to me, that he was of all Men living the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rably envious.

<PB N="170" REF="180">
Temper, that renders him unwilling to be pleas'd with any Thing without him that has either Beau|ty or Perfection in it. I look upon it as a Di&s;tem|per in the Mind, (which I know no Morali&s;t that has de&s;cribed in this Light) when a Man cannot di&s;cern any Thing which another is Ma&s;ter of that is agreeable. For which Rea&s;on, I look up|on the good-natured Man to be endowed with a certain di&s;cerning Faculty which the Envious are altogether deprived of. Shallow Wits, &s;uperficial Criticks, and conceited Fops, are with me &s;o ma|ny blind Men in re&s;pect of Excellencies. They can behold nothing but Faults and Blemi&s;hes, and indeed &s;ee nothing that is worth &s;eeing. Show them a Poem, it is Stuff; a Picture, it is Daubing. They find nothing in Architecture that is not ir|regular, or in Mu&s;ick that is not out of Tune. The&s;e Men &s;hould con&s;ider, that it is their Envy which deforms every Thing, and that the Ugli|ne&s;s is not in the Object, but in the Eye. And as for nobler Minds, who&s;e Merits are either not di&s;covered, or are mi&s;repre&s;ented by the envious Part of Mankind, they &s;hould rather con&s;ider their Defamers with Pity than Indignation. A Man cannot have an Idea of Perfection in ano|ther, which he was never &s;en&s;ible of in him&s;elf. Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> tells us, That upon asking a blind Man, What he thought Scarlet was? He an&s;wered, That he believed it was like the Sound of a Trumpet. He was forced to form his Conceptions of Idea's which he had not, by tho&s;e which he had. In the &s;ame Manner, ask an envious Man, What he thinks of Virtue? He will call it De&s;ign: What of Good|nature? And he will term it Dulne&s;s. The Diffe|rence is, That as the Per&s;on before-mentioned was born blind, your envious Men have con|tracted the Di&s;temper them&s;elves, and are trou|bled with a Sort of an acquired Blindne&s;s. Thus the Devil in <HI>Milton,</HI> tho' made an Angel of Light, could &s;ee nothing to plea&s;e him even in Para|di&s;e,

<P>THE whole Creation preys upon it &s;elf: E|very living Creature is inhabited. A Flea has a Thou&s;and invi&s;ible In&s;ects that teaze him as he jumps from Place to Place, and revenge our Quarrels upon him. A very ordinary Micro&s;cope &s;hows us, that a Lou&s;e is it &s;elf a very lou&s;y Creature. A Whale, be&s;ides tho&s;e Seas and O|ceans in the &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els of his Body, which are filled with innumerable Shoals of little Ani|mals, carries about it a whole World of Inhabi|tants; in&s;omuch that, if we believe the Calcula|tions &s;ome have made, there are more living Creatures which are too &s;mall for the naked Eye to behold about the Leviathan, than there are of vi&s;ible Creatures upon the Face of the whole Earth. Thus every nobler Creature is as it were the Ba&s;is and Support of Multitudes that are his Inferiors.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration very much comforts me, when I think on tho&s;e numberle&s;s Vermin that feed upon this Paper, and find their Su&s;tenance out of it: I mean, the &s;mall Wits and Scribble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> that every Day turn a Penny by nibbling at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Lucubrations.

<P>They &s;ay, when a Fox is very much troubled with Fleas, he goes into the next Pool with a lit|tle Lock of Wool in his Mouth, and keeps his Body under Water till the Vermin get into it, after which he quits the Wool, and diving, leaves his Tormentors to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and get their Livelihood where they can. I would have the&s;e Gentlemen take Care that I do not &s;erve them after the &s;ame Manner; for though I have hitherto kept my Temper pretty well, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but I may &s;ome Time or other di&s;ap|pear; and what will then become of them? Should I lay down my Paper, What a Famine would there be among the Hawkers, Printers, Book&s;ellers, and Authors? It would be like Dr. <HI>B&mdash;s</HI>'s dropping his Cloak, with the whole Congregation hanging upon the Skirts of it.

able to under&s;tand it? The fir&s;t Thing that &s;trikes your Eye, is the <HI>Breaks</HI> at the End of almo&s;t every Sentence, of which I know not the U&s;e, only that it is a Refinement, and very frequently practi&s;ed. Then you will ob&s;erve the Abbrevia|tions and Eli&s;ions, by which Con&s;onants of mo&s;t obdurate Sound are joined together, without one &s;oftening Vowel to intervene; and all this only to make one Syllable of Two, directly contrary to the Example of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> alto|gether of the <HI>Gothick</HI> Strain, and a natural Ten|dency towards relap&s;ing into Barbarity, which delights in Mono&s;yllables, and uniting of Mute Con&s;onants, as it is ob&s;ervable in all the Nor|thern Languages. And this is &s;till more vi&s;ible in the next Refinement, which con&s;i&s;ts in pro|nouncing the fir&s;t Syllable in a Word that has many, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the re&s;t; &s;uch as <HI>Phizz, Hipps, Mobb, Pozz, Rep,</HI> and many more, when we are already overloaded with Mono&s;yllables, which are the Di&s;grace of our Language. Thus we cram one Syllable, and cut off the re&s;t, as the Owl fattened her Mice after &s;he had bit off their Legs, to prevent them from running away; and if ours be the &s;ame Rea&s;on for maiming our Words, it will certainly an&s;wer the End, for I am &s;ure no other Nation will de&s;ire to borrow them. Some Words are hitherto but fairly &s;plit, and therefore only in their Way to Perfection; as <HI>Incog,</HI> and <HI>Plenipo:</HI> But in a &s;hort Time, 'tis to be hoped, they will be further dock'd to <HI>Inc.</HI> and <HI>Plen.</HI> This Reflection has made me of late Years very impatient for a Peace, which I believe would &s;ave the Lives of many brave Words, as well as Men. The War has introduced abun|dance of Poly&s;yllables, which will never be able to live many more Campaigns. <HI>Speculations, Operations, Preliminaries, Amba&s;&s;adors, Palli&s;a|does, Communication, Circumvallation, Battalions,</HI> as numerous as they are, if they attack us too
<PB N="182" REF="192">
frequently in our Coffee-hou&s;es, we &s;hall certain|ly put them to Flight, and cut off the Rear.</P>
<P>The Third Refinement ob&s;ervable in the Letter I &s;end you, con&s;i&s;ts in the Choice of certain Words invented by &s;ome <HI>pretty Fellows,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Banter, Bamboozle, Country Put,</HI> and <HI>Kidney,</HI> as it is there applied, &s;ome of which are now &s;trug|gling for the Vogue, and others are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. I have done my utmo&s;t for &s;ome Years pa&s;t to &s;top the Progre&s;s of <HI>Mobb</HI> and <HI>Banter,</HI> but have been plainly born down by Numbers, and betrayed by tho&s;e who promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, you are to take Notice of cer|tain choice Phra&s;es &s;cattered through the Letter, &s;ome of them tolerable enough, till they were worn to Rags by &s;ervile Imitators. You might ea&s;ily find them, though they were not in a dif|ferent Print, and therefore I need not di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the fal&s;e Refinements in our Style which you ought to correct: Fir&s;t, by Argument and fair Means; but if tho&s;e fail, I think you are to make U&s;e of your Authority as Cen&s;or, and by an Annual <HI>Index Expurgatorius</HI> expunge all Words and Phra&s;es that are offen&s;ive to good Sen&s;e, and condemn tho&s;e barbarous Mutilations of Vowels and Syllables. In this la&s;t Point, the u&s;ual Pretence is, That they &s;pell as they &s;peak: A noble Standard for Language! To depend up|on the Caprice of every Coxcomb, who becau&s;e Words are the Cloathing of our Thoughts, cuts them out and &s;hapes them as he plea&s;es, and changes them oftner than his Dre&s;s. I believe all rea&s;onable People would be content that &s;uch Refiners were more &s;paring in their Words, and liberal in their Syllables: And upon this Head, I &s;hould be glad you would be&s;tow &s;ome Advice upon &s;everal young Readers in our Churches, who coming up from the Univer&s;ity full fraight
<PB N="183" REF="193">
with Admiration of our Town Politene&s;s, will needs correct the Style of their Prayer-Books. In reading the Ab&s;olution, they are very careful to &s;ay <HI>Pardons</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;olves;</HI> and in the Prayer for the Royal Family, it mu&s;t be <HI>endue'um, enrich'um, pro&s;per'um,</HI> and <HI>bring'um.</HI> Then in their Ser|mons they u&s;e all the modern Terms of Art, <HI>Sham, Banter, Mob, Bubble, Bully, Cutting, Shuf|fling,</HI> and <HI>Palming;</HI> all which, and many more of the like Stamp, as I have heard them often in the Pulpit from &s;uch young Sophi&s;ters, &s;o I have read them in &s;ome of <HI>tho&s;e Sermons that have made mo&s;t Noi&s;e of late.</HI> The De&s;ign, it &s;eems, is to avoid the dreadful Imputation of Pedantry; to &s;hew us, that they know the Town, under&s;tand Men and Manners, and have not been poring upon old unfa&s;hionable Books in the Uni|ver&s;ity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you the In&s;trument of introducing into our Style that Simplicity which is the be&s;t and true&s;t Ornament of mo&s;t Things in Life, which the politer Ages always aimed at in their Building and Dre&s;s, <HI>(Simplex Munditiis)</HI> as well as their Productions of Wit. 'Tis mani|fe&s;t, that all new affected Modes of Speech, whe|ther borrowed from the Court, the Town, or the Theatre, are the fir&s;t peri&s;hing Parts in any Language; and, as I could prove by many Hun|dred In&s;tances, have been &s;o in ours. The Wri|tings of <HI>Hooker,</HI> who was a Country Clergyman, and of <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> the Je&s;uit, both in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> are in a Style that, with very few Allowances, would not offend any pre&s;ent Reader; much more clear and intelligible than tho&s;e of Sir <HI>H. Wootton,</HI> Sir <HI>Rob. Naunton, Osborn, Daniel</HI> the Hi&s;torian, and &s;everal others who writ later; but being Men of the Court, and af|fecting the Phra&s;es then in Fa&s;hion, they are of|ten either not to be under&s;tood, or appear perfect|ly ridiculous.</P>

<P>THere are very many ill Habits that might with much Ea&s;e have been prevented, which, after we have indulged our &s;elves in them, be|come incorrigible. We have a &s;ort of Proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>taking a Woman down in her Wed|ding Shoes,</HI> if you would bring her to Rea&s;on. An early Behaviour of this Sort, had a very re|markable good Effect in a Family wherein I was &s;everal Years an intimate Acquaintance.</P>
<P>A Gentleman in <HI>Lincolu&s;hire</HI> had Four Daugh|ters, Three of which were early married very happily; but the Fourth, though no Way inferior to any of her Si&s;ters, either in Per&s;on or Accom|pli&s;hments, had from her Infancy di&s;covered &s;o imperious a Temper, (u&s;ually called a High Spi|rit) that it continually made great Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Family, became her known Character in the Neighbourhood, and deterred all her Lovers from declaring them&s;elves. However, in Proce&s;s of Time, a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune and
<PB N="185" REF="195">
long Acquaintance, having ob&s;erved that Quick|ne&s;s of Spirit to be her only Fault, made his Ad|dre&s;&s;es, and obtained her Con&s;ent in due Form. The Lawyers fini&s;hed the Writings, (in which, by the Way, there was no Pin-Money) and they were married. After a decent Time &s;pent in the Father's Hou&s;e, the Bridegroom went to prepare his Seat for her Reception. During the whole Cour&s;e of his Court&s;hip, though a Man of the mo&s;t equal Temper, he had artificially lamented to her, that he was the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Creature breathing. By this one Intimation, he at once made her under&s;tand Warmth of Temper to be what he ought to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her again&s;t that Con&s;titution in him|&s;elf. She at the &s;ame Time thought her &s;elf high|ly obliged by the compo&s;ed Behaviour which he maintained in her Pre&s;ence. Thus far he with great Succe&s;s &s;oothed her from being guilty of Violences, and &s;till re&s;olved to give her &s;uch a terrible Apprehen&s;ion of his fiery Spirit, that &s;he &s;hould never dream of giving Way to her own. He returned on the Day appointed for carrying her Home; but in&s;tead of a Coach and Six Hor&s;es, together with the gay Equipage &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, he appeared without a Servant, mounted on the Skeleton of a Hor&s;e which his Hunt&s;man had the Day before brought in to fea&s;t his Dogs on the Arrival of their new Mi&s;tre&s;s, with a Pillion fixed behind, and a Ca&s;e of Pi|&s;tols before him, attended only by a Favourite Hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but &s;omewhat po&s;itive) Manner de&s;ired his La|dy to &s;eat her &s;elf on the Cu&s;hion; which done, away they crawled. The Road being ob&s;truct|ed by a Gate, the Dog was commanded to open it: The poor Cur looked up and wagged his Tail; but the Ma&s;ter, to &s;hew the Impa|tience of his Temper, drew a Pi&s;tol and &s;hot him dead. He had no &s;ooner done it, but he
<PB N="186" REF="196">
fell into a Thou&s;and Apologies for his unhappy Ra&s;hne&s;s, and begged as many Pardons for his Exce&s;&s;es before one for whom he had &s;o profound a Re&s;pect. Soon after their Steed &s;tum|bled, but with &s;ome Difficulty recovered: How|ever, the Bridegroom took Occa&s;ion to &s;wear, if he frighted his Wife &s;o again, he would run him through: And alas! the poor Animal being now almo&s;t tired, made a &s;econd Trip; imme|diately on which the careful Husband alights, and with great Ceremony fir&s;t takes off his La|dy, then the Accoutrements, draws his Sword, and &s;aves the Hunt&s;man the Trouble of killing him: Then &s;ays to his Wife, Child, prithee take up the Saddle; which &s;he readily did, and tug|ged it Home, where they found all Things in the greate&s;t Order, &s;uitable to their Fortune and the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion. Some Time after the Fa|ther of the Lady gave an Entertainment to all his Daughters and their Husbands, where, when the Wives were retired, and the Gentleman pa&s;|&s;ing a Toa&s;t about, our la&s;t married Man took Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve to the re&s;t of his Brethren, how much, to his great Satisfaction, he found the World mi&s;taken as to the Temper of his Lady, for that &s;he was the mo&s;t meek and hum|ble Woman breathing. The Applau&s;e was re|ceived with a loud Laugh: But as a Tryal which of them would appear the mo&s;t Ma&s;ter at Home, he propo&s;ed they &s;hould all by Turns &s;end for their Wives down to them. A Servant was di&s;|patched, and An&s;wer was made by one, Tell him I will come by and by; another, That &s;he would come when the Cards were out of her Hand; and &s;o on. But no &s;ooner was her Hus|band's De&s;ire whi&s;pered in the Ear of our la&s;t married Lady, but the Cards were clapped on the Table, and down &s;he comes with, My Dear, would you &s;peak with me? He receives her in his Arms, and after repeated Care&s;&s;es tells her

the Experiment, confe&s;&s;es his good Nature, and a&s;&s;ures her That &s;ince &s;he could now command her, Temper, he would no longer di&s;gui&s;e his own.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have waited on you very frequently to have di&s;cour&s;ed you upon &s;ome Matters of Moment, but that I love to be well informed in the Subject upon which I con&s;ult my Friends be|fore I enter into Debate with them. I have there|fore with the utmo&s;t Care and Pains applied my &s;elf to the reading all the Writings and Pam|phlets which have come out &s;ince the Trial, and have &s;tudied Night and Day in order to be Ma|&s;ter of the whole Controver&s;y: But the Authors are &s;o numerous, and the State of Affairs alters &s;o very fa&s;t, that I am now a Fortnight behind|hand in my Reading, and know only how Things &s;tood Twelve Days ago. I wi&s;h you would enter into tho&s;e u&s;eful Subjects; for, if I may be allowed to &s;ay &s;o, the&s;e are not Times to je&s;t in. As for my own Part, you know very well, that I am of a publick Spirit, and never regarded my own Intere&s;t, but looked further; and let me tell you, that while &s;ome People are minding only them&s;elves and Families, and o|thers are thinking only of their own Country, Thing go on &s;trangely in the <HI>North.</HI> I fore&s;ee very great Evils ari&s;ing from the Neglect of Tran&s;actions at a Di&s;tance; for which Rea&s;on I am now writing a Letter to a Friend in the Country, which I de&s;ign as an An&s;wer to the
<PB N="189" REF="199">
Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Letter to the Grand Signior concerning his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Sweden.</HI> I have en|deavoured to prove, that it is not rea&s;onable to expect that his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould leave <HI>Bender</HI> without Forty Thou&s;and Men; and I have added to this, an Apology for the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks.</HI> But the Matter multiplies upon me, and I grow dim with much Writing; therefore de&s;ire, if you have an old green Pair of Spectacles, &s;uch as you u&s;ed about your Fiftieth Year, that you &s;end them to me; as al&s;o, that you would plea&s;e to de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> to &s;end me in a Bu&s;hel of Coals on the Credit of my An&s;wer to his Cza|rian Maje&s;ty; for I de&s;ign it &s;hall be printed for <HI>Morphew,</HI> and the Weather grows &s;harp. I &s;hall take it kindly if you would order him al&s;o to &s;end me the Papers as they come out. If there are no fre&s;h Pamphlets publi&s;hed, I compute that I &s;hall know before the End of next Month what has been done in Town to this Day. If it were not for an ill Cu&s;tom lately introduced by a certain Author, of talking <HI>Latin</HI> at the Begin|ning of Papers, Matters would be in a much clearer Light than they are: But to our Com|fort, there are &s;olid Writers who are not guilty of this Pedantry. The <HI>Po&s;t-Man</HI> writes like an Angel: The <HI>Moderator</HI> is fine Reading! It would do you no Harm to read the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy</HI> with Attention; he is very deep of late. He is In|&s;tructive; but I confe&s;s a little Satyrical: A &s;harp Pen! He cares not what he &s;ays. The <HI>Exa|miner</HI> is admirable, and is become a grave and &s;ub&s;tantial Author. But above all, I am at a Lo&s;s how to govern my &s;elf in my Judgment of tho&s;e who&s;e whole Writings con&s;i&s;t in Interro|gatories: And then the Way of an&s;wering, by propo&s;ing Que&s;tions as hard to them, is quite as extraordinary. As for my Part, I tremble at the&s;e Novelties; we expo&s;e, in my Opinion, our Af|fairs too much by it. You may be &s;ure the

<P>This unhappy Corre&s;pondent, who&s;e fanta&s;tical Loyalty to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has reduced him to this low Condition of Rea&s;on and Fortune, would appear much more mon&s;trous in his Mad|ne&s;s, did we not &s;ee Crowds very little above his Circum&s;tances from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, a Pa&s;&s;ion to Politicks.</P>
<P>It is no unplea&s;ant Entertainment to con&s;ider the Commerce even of the Sexes interrupted by Difference in State Affairs. A Wench and her Gallant parted la&s;t Week upon the Words <HI>Unli|mited</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive:</HI> And there is &s;uch a Jargon of Terms got into the Mouths of the very &s;illie&s;t of the Women, that you cannot come into a Room even among them, but you find them divided in|to <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> What heightens the Humour is, that all the hard Words they know, they cer|tainly &s;uppo&s;e to be Terms u&s;eful in the Di&s;putes of the Parties. I came in this Day where Two were in very hot Debate, and one of them pro|po&s;ed to me to explain to them what was the Dif|ference between Circumci&s;ion and Prede&s;tination. You may be &s;ure I was at a Lo&s;s; but they were too angry at each other to wait for my Explana|tion, but proceeded to lay open the whole State of Affairs, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual Topicks of Dre&s;s, Gallantry and Scandal.</P>
<P>I have often wondered how it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible that this Turn to Politicks &s;hould &s;o univer&s;ally prevail, to the Exclu&s;ion of every other Subject out
<PB N="191" REF="201">
of Conver&s;ation; and upon mature Con&s;ideration, find it is for Want of Di&s;cour&s;e. Look round you among all the young Fellows you meet, and you &s;ee tho&s;e who have lea&s;t Reli&s;h for Books, Com|pany, or Plea&s;ure, though they have no Manner of Qualities to make them &s;ucceed in tho&s;e Pur|&s;uits, &s;hall make very pa&s;&s;able Politicians. Thus the mo&s;t barren Invention &s;hall find enough to &s;ay to make one appear an able Man in the Top-Cof|fee-hou&s;es. It is but adding a certain Vehemence in uttering your &s;elf, let the Thing you &s;ay be never &s;o flat, and you &s;hall be thought a very &s;en&s;ible Man, if you were not too hot. As Love and Honour are the noble&s;t Motives of Life; &s;o the Pretenders to them, without being animated by them, are the mo&s;t contemptible of all Sorts of Pretenders. The unju&s;t Affectation of any Thing that is laudable, is ignominious in Proportion to the Worth of the Thing we affect: Thus, as Love of one's Country is the mo&s;t glorious of all Pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;ee the mo&s;t ordinary Tools in a Na|tion give them&s;elves Airs that Way, without any one good Quality in their own Life, has &s;omething in it Romantick, yet not &s;o ridiculous as odious.</P>

<P>WHEN the Mind has been perplexed with anxious Cares and Pa&s;&s;ions, the be&s;t Me|thod of bringing it to its u&s;ual State of Tranqui|lity, is, as much as we po&s;&s;ibly can, to turn our Thoughts to the Adver&s;ities of Per&s;ons of higher Con&s;ideration in Virtue and Merit than our &s;elves. By this Means all the little Incidents of our own Lives, if they are unfortunate, &s;eem to be the Ef|fect of Ju&s;tice upon our Faults and Indi&s;cretions. When tho&s;e whom we know to be excellent and de&s;erving of a better Fate are wretched, we cannot but re&s;ign our &s;elves, whom mo&s;t of us know to merit a much wor&s;e State than that we are placed in. For &s;uch and many other Occa&s;ions, there is one admirable Relation which one might re|commend for certain Periods of one's Life, to touch, comfort, and improve the Heart of Man. <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ays, &s;omewhere, The Plea&s;ures of an Hu&s;|bandman are next to tho&s;e of a Philo&s;opher. In like Manner one may &s;ay, (for methinks they bear the &s;ame Proportion one to another) the Plea&s;ures of Humanity are next to tho&s;e of Devotion. In both the&s;e latter Satisfactions, there is a certain Humiliation which exalts the Soul above its ordi|nary State. At the &s;ame Time that it le&s;&s;ens our Value of our &s;elves, it enlarges our E&s;timation of others. The Hi&s;tory I am going to &s;peak of, is
<PB N="193" REF="203">
that of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in Holy Writ, which is related with &s;uch Maje&s;tick Simplicity, that all the Parts of it &s;trike us with &s;trong Touches of Nature and Compa&s;&s;ion, and he mu&s;t be a Stranger to both who can read it with Attention, and not be over|whelmed with the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Joy and Sor|row. I hope it will not be a Prophanation to tell it ones own Way here, that they who may be unthinking enough to be more frequently Readers of &s;uch Papers as this than of Sacred Writ, may be adverti&s;ed, that the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures the Ima|gination can be entertained with are to be found there, and that even the Style of the Scriptures is more than Humane.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> a beloved Child of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> became invi|dious to his elder Brethren, for no other Rea&s;on but his &s;uperior Beauty and Excellence of Body and Mind, in&s;omuch that they could not bear his growing Virtue, and let him live. They there|fore con&s;pire his Death; but Nature pleaded &s;o &s;trongly for him in the Heart of one of them, that by his Per&s;wa&s;ion they determined rather to bury him in a Pit, than be his immediate Execu|tioners with their own Hands. When thus much was obtained for him, their Minds &s;till &s;oftened towards him, and they took the Opportunity of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers to &s;ell him into <HI>Egypt. I&s;rael</HI> was per&s;uaded by the Artifice of his Sons, that the Youth was torn to Pieces by Wild Bea&s;ts: But <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;old to Slavery, and &s;till expo&s;ed to new Misfortunes, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e as before, his Beauty and his Virtue. By a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation he was committed to Pri&s;on, but in Proce&s;s of Time delivered from it, in Con&s;ideration of his Wi&s;|dom and Knowledge, and made the Governor of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Hou&s;e. In this Elevation of his For|tune, his Brothers were &s;ent into <HI>Egypt</HI> to buy Ne|ce&s;&s;aries of Life in a Famine. As &s;oon as they are brought into his Pre&s;ence, he beholds, but he beholds with Compa&s;&s;ion, the Men who had &s;old
<PB N="194" REF="204">
him to Slavery approaching him with Awe and Reverence. While he was looking over his Bre|thren, he takes a Re&s;olution to indulge him&s;elf in the Plea&s;ure of &s;tirring their and his own Af|fections, by keeping him&s;elf concealed, and exa|mining into the Circum&s;tances of their Family. For this End, with an Air of Severity, as a watch|ful Mini&s;ter to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he accu&s;es them as Spies, who are come into <HI>Egypt</HI> with De&s;igns again&s;t the State. This led them into the Account which he wanted of them, the Condition of their ancient Father and little Brother, whom they had left be|hind them. When he had learned that his Bro|ther was living, he demands the bringing him to <HI>Egypt,</HI> as a Proof of their Veracity.</P>
<P>But it would be a vain and empty Endeavour to attempt laying this excellent Repre&s;entation of the Pa&s;&s;ions of Man in the &s;ame Colours as they appear in the Sacred Writ in any other Manner, or almo&s;t any other Words, than tho&s;e made u&s;e of in the Page it &s;elf. I am obliged therefore to turn my de&s;igned Narration rather into a Com|ment upon the &s;everal Parts of that beautiful and pa&s;&s;ionate Scene. When <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> expects to &s;ee <HI>Benjamin,</HI> How natural, and how forcible is the Reflection, <HI>This Affliction is come upon us in that we &s;aw the Angui&s;h of our Brother's Soul</HI> without Pity? How moving mu&s;t it be to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to hear <HI>Reuben</HI> accu&s;e the re&s;t, that they would not hear what he pleaded in Behalf of his Innocence and Di&s;tre&s;s? He turns from them and weeps, but commands his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far as to give Orders for binding one of them in the Pre&s;ence of the re&s;t, while he at Lei&s;ure ob&s;erved their different Sentiments and Concern in their Ge&s;ture and Countenance. When <HI>Benjamin</HI> is demanded in Bondage for &s;tealing the Cup, With what Force, and what Re&s;ignation does <HI>Judah</HI> addre&s;s his Brother?</P>
<P>In what Words &s;hall I &s;peak to my Lord; with what Confidence can I &s;ay any Thing? Our Guilt
<PB N="195" REF="205">
is but too apparent, we &s;ubmit to our Fate. <HI>We are my Lord's Servants, both we and he al&s;o with whom the Cup is found.</HI> When that is not accep|ted, How pathetically does he recapitulate the whole Story? And approaching nearer to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> delivers him&s;elf as follows; which, if we fix our Thoughts upon the Relation between the Plea|der and the Judge, it is impo&s;&s;ible to read with|out Tears.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Let me intrude &s;o far upon you even in the high Condition in which you are, and the mi&s;erable One in which you &s;ee me and my Brethren, to in|form you of the Circum&s;tances of us unhappy Men that pro&s;trate our &s;elves before you. When we were fir&s;t examined by you, you enquired, (for what Rea&s;on my Lord enquired we know not;) but you enquired whether we had not a Father or a Brother? We then acquainted you, that we had a Father, an old Man, who had a Child of his old Age, and had buried another Son whom he had by the &s;ame Woman. You were plea&s;ed to command us to bring the Child he had remaining down to you: We did &s;o, and he has forfeited his Liberty. But my Father &s;aid to us, You know that my Wife bare me Two Sons, one of them was torn in Pieces: If Mi&s;chief befal this al&s;o, it will bring my Grey Hairs with Sor|row to the Grave. Accept, therefore, Oh my Lord! me for your Bond-man, and let the Lad return with his Brethren, that I may not &s;ee the Evil that &s;hall come on my Father. Here <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion grew too great for further Di&s;gui&s;e, and he reveals him&s;elf with Exclamations of Tran&s;port and Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After their Recovery from their fir&s;t A&s;toni&s;h|ment, his Brethren were &s;eized with Fear for the Injuries they had done him; but how generou&s;ly does he keep them in Countenance, and make an
<PB N="196" REF="206">
Apology for them: <HI>Be not angry with your &s;elves for &s;elling me hither;</HI> call it not &s;o, but think Pro|vidence &s;ent me before you to pre&s;erve Life.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to go through all the Beau|ties of this &s;acred Narrative; but any who &s;hall read it, at an Hour when he is di&s;engaged from all other Regard or Intere&s;ts than what ari&s;e from it, will feel the alternate Pa&s;&s;ion of a Father, a Brother, and a Son, &s;o warm in him, that they will incline him to exert him&s;elf (in &s;uch of tho&s;e Characters as happen to be his) much above the ordinary Cour&s;e of his Life.</P>

<P>I HAVE Rea&s;on to believe, that certain of my Contemporaries have made U&s;e of an Art (I &s;ome time ago profe&s;&s;ed) of being often de&s;ign|edly dull; and for that Rea&s;on &s;hall not exert my &s;elf when I &s;ee them lazy.

This Paper therefore &s;hall be taken up by my Corre&s;pon|dents, Two of which have &s;ent me the Two fol|lowing plain, but &s;en&s;ible and hone&s;t Letters, upon Subjects no le&s;s important than tho&s;e of Education and Devotion.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am an old Man, retired from all Acquain|tance with the Town, but what I have from your Papers (not the wor&s;t Entertainment of
<PB N="197" REF="207">
my Solitude;) yet being &s;till a Well-wi&s;her to my Country and the Commonwealth of Learn|ing <HI>(a qua, confitcor, nullam Aetatis meae Par|tem abhorrui&s;&s;e;)</HI> and hoping the plain Phra&s;e in Writing that was current in my younger Days would have la&s;ted for my Time, I was &s;tartled at the Picture of modern Politene&s;s (tran&s;mit|ted by your ingenious Corre&s;pondent), and grie|ved to &s;ee our Sterling <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language fallen into the Hands of <HI>Clippers</HI> and <HI>Coyners.</HI> That mutilated Epi&s;tle, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Hippo, Rep's,</HI> and &s;uch-like enormous Curtailings, was a mortify|ing Spectacle, but with the Re&s;erve of Comfort to find this, and other Abu&s;es of our Mother-Tongue, &s;o pathetically complained of, and to the proper Per&s;on for redre&s;&s;ing them, the Cen|&s;or of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>He had before repre&s;ented, <HI>the deplorable Ig|norance that for &s;everal Years pa&s;t has reigned among&s;t our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Writers, the great Depravity of our Ta&s;te, and continual Corruption of our Style:</HI> But, Sir, before you give your &s;elf the Trouble of pre&s;cribing Remedies for the&s;e Di&s;tempers, (which you own will require the greate&s;t Care and Application) give me Leave (having long had my Eye upon the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs, and Thoughts exerci&s;ed about them) to mention what I hum|bly conceive to be the Cau&s;e of them, and in your Friend <HI>Horace's</HI> Words, <HI>Quo Fonte derivata Clades in Patriam Populumque fluxit.</HI></P>
<P>I take our corrupt Ways of Writing to pro|ceed from the Mi&s;takes and wrong Mea&s;ures in our common Methods of <HI>Education,</HI> which I al|ways looked upon as one of our National Grie|vances, and a Singularity that renders us no le&s;s than our Situation,
<Q><L>&mdash; Penitus toto divi&s;os Orbe Britannos.</L></Q>
This puts me upon con&s;ulting the mo&s;t celebra|ted Criticks on that Subject, to compare our Pra|ctice
<PB N="198" REF="208">
with their Precepts, and find where it was that we came &s;hort or went wide.</P>
<P>But after all, I found our Ca&s;e required &s;ome|thing more than the&s;e Doctors had directed, and the principal Defect of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;cipline to lie in the <HI>Initiatory</HI> Part, which, altho' it needs the greate&s;t Care and Skill, is u&s;ually left to the Conduct of tho&s;e blind Guides, <HI>viz.</HI> Chance and Ignorance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trouble you with but a &s;ingle In&s;tance, pur&s;uant to what your &s;agacious Friend has &s;aid, That he <HI>could furni&s;h you with a Catalogue of</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Books, that would co&s;t you a Hundred Pounds at fir&s;t Hand, wherein you could not find Ten Lines together of common</HI> Grammar; which is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of our Mi&s;management in that Province.</P>
<P>For can any Thing be more ab&s;urd than our Way of Proceeding in this Part of Literature? To pu&s;h tender Wits into the intricate Mazes of Grammar, and a <HI>Latin</HI> Grammer? To learn an unknown Art by an unknown Tongue? To carry them a dark Round-about Way to let them in at a Back-Door? Whereas by teaching them fir&s;t the Grammar of their Mother-Tongue, (&s;o ea&s;y to be learned) their Advance to the Grammars of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> would be gradual and ea&s;y; but our precipitate Way of hurrying them over &s;uch a <HI>Gulph,</HI> before we have built them a <HI>Bridge</HI> to it, is a Shock to their weak Under&s;tandings, which they &s;eldom, or very late, recover. In the mean Time we wrong Nature, and &s;lander Infants, who want neither Capacity nor Will to learn, till we put them up|on Service beyond their Strength, and then in|deed we baulk them.</P>
<P>The Liberal Arts and Sciences are all beauti|ful as the <HI>Graces;</HI> nor has <HI>Grammar</HI> (the &s;e|vere Mother of all) &s;o frightful a Face of her <HI>Own;</HI> 'tis the <HI>Vizard</HI> put upon it that &s;cares
<PB N="199" REF="209">
Children. She is made to &s;peak hard Words, that to them &s;ound like Conjuring. Let her talk intelligibly, and they will li&s;ten to her.</P>
<P>In this, I think, as on other Accounts, we &s;hew our &s;elves true <HI>Britains,</HI> always overlook|ing our natural Advantages. It has been the Practice of wi&s;e&s;t Nations to learn their own Language by &s;tated Rules, to avoid the Confu|&s;ion that would follow from leaving it to vul|gar U&s;e. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue (&s;ays a learned Man) is the mo&s;t determinate in its Con&s;tru|ction, and reducible to the fewe&s;t Rules What|ever Language has le&s;s Grammar in it, is not in|telligible; and whatever has more, all that it has more is &s;uperfluous; for which Rea&s;ons he would have it made the Foundation of learning <HI>Latin,</HI> and all other Languages.</P>
<P>To &s;peak and write without Ab&s;urdity the Language of one's Country, is commendable in Per&s;ons of all Stations, and to &s;ome indi&s;pen&s;i|bly nece&s;&s;ary; and to this Purpo&s;e, I would re|commend above all Things the having a <HI>Gram|mar</HI> of our Mother-Tongue fir&s;t taught in our Schools, which would facilitate our Youths learning their <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek Grammars,</HI> with &s;pare Time for Arithmetick, A&s;tronomy, Co&s;|mography, Hi&s;tory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that would make them pa&s;s the Spring of their Life with Profit and Plea&s;ure, that is now mi&s;erably &s;pent in Gram|matical Perplexities.</P>
<P>But here, methinks, I &s;ee the Reader &s;mile, and ready to ask me, (as the Lawyer did Sexton <HI>Diego</HI> on his bequeathing rich Legacies to the Poor of the Pari&s;h. Where are the&s;e mighty Sums to be rai&s;ed?) Where is there &s;uch a <HI>Grammar</HI> to be had? I will not an&s;wer, as he did, Even where your Wor&s;hip plea&s;es. No, it is our good Fortune to have &s;uch a <HI>Grammar,</HI> with Notes, now in the Pre&s;s, and to be publi&s;hed next Term.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="210">
I hear it is a chargeable Work, and wi&s;h the Publi&s;her to have Cu&s;tomers of all that have Need of &s;uch a Book; yet fancy that he can|not be much a Sufferer, if it is only bought by all that have more Need for it than they think they have.</P>
<P>A certain Author brought a Poem to Mr. <HI>Cow|ley,</HI> for his Peru&s;al and Judgment of the Perfor|mance, which he demanded at the next Vi&s;it with a Poeta&s;ter's A&s;&s;urance; and Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> with his u&s;ual Mode&s;ty, de&s;ired that he would be plea&s;ed to look a little to the <HI>Grammar</HI> of it. To the <HI>Grammar</HI> of it! What do you mean, Sir? Would you &s;end me to School again? Why Mr. <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> Would it do you any Harm?</P>
<P>This put me on con&s;idering how this Voyage of Literature may be made with more Safety and Profit, Expedition and Delight; and at la&s;t, for compleating &s;o good a Service, to reque&s;t your Directions in &s;o deplorable a Ca&s;e; hoping that, as you have had Compa&s;&s;ion on our over-grown Coxcombs in Concerns of le&s;s Con&s;equence, you will exert your Charity towards Innocents, and vouch&s;afe to be Guardian to the Children and Youth of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in this important Affair of <HI>Education,</HI> wherein Mi&s;takes and wrong Mea|&s;ures have &s;o often occa&s;ioned their Aver&s;ion to Books, that had otherwi&s;e proved the chief Or|nament and Plea&s;ure of their Life.

<P>AMong tho&s;e Inclinations which are common to all Men, there is none more unaccounta|ble than that unequal Love by which Parents di|&s;tingui&s;h their Children from each other. Some|times Vanity and Self-love appear to have a Share towards this Effect; and in other In&s;tances I have been apt to attribute it to meer In&s;tinct: But however that is, we frequently &s;ee the Child that has been beholden to neither of the&s;e Im|pul&s;es in their Parents, in &s;pight of being neg|lected, &s;nubbed, and thwarted at Home, acquire a Behaviour which makes it as agreeable to all the re&s;t of the World, as that of every one el&s;e of
<PB N="202" REF="212">
their Family is to each other. I fell into this Way of Thinking from an Intimacy which I have with a very good Hou&s;e in our Neighbourhood, where there are Three Daughters of a very different Character and Genius. The elde&s;t has a great deal of Wit and Cunning; the Second has good Sen&s;e, but no Artifice; the Third has much Vi|vacity, but little Under&s;tanding. The Fir&s;t is a fine, but &s;cornful Woman; the Second is not charming, but very winning; the Third no Way commendable, but very de&s;irable. The Father of the&s;e young Creatures was ever a great Pretender to Wit, the Mother a Woman of as much Coquet|try. This Turn in the Parents has bia&s;&s;ed their Affections towards their Children. The old Man &s;uppo&s;es the elde&s;t of his own Genius, and the Mother looks upon the younge&s;t as her &s;elf re|newed. By this Means, all the Lovers that ap|proach the Hou&s;e are di&s;carded by the Father for not ob&s;erving Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Wit and Beauty, and by the Mother for being blind to the Mien and Air of Mrs. <HI>Biddy.</HI> Come never &s;o many Preten|ders, they are not &s;u&s;pected to have the lea&s;t Thoughts of Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> the middle Daughter. <HI>Betty</HI> therefore is mortified into a Woman of a great deal of Merit, and knows &s;he mu&s;t depend on that only for her Advancement. The middle|mo&s;t is thus the Favourite of all her Acquaintance as well as mine, while the other Two carry a certain In&s;olence about them in all Conver&s;ations, and expect the Partiality which they meet with at Home to attend them wherever they appear. So little do Parents under&s;tand that they are of all People the lea&s;t Judges of their Children's Merit, that what they reckon &s;uch is &s;eldom any Thing el&s;e but a Repetition of their own Faults and Infirmities.</P>
<P>There is, methinks, &s;ome Excu&s;e for being par|ticular, when one of the Offspring has any Defect in Nature. In this Ca&s;e, the Child, if we may &s;o
<PB N="203" REF="213">
&s;peak, is &s;o much the longer the Child of its Pa|rents, and calls for the Continuance of their Care and Indulgence from the Slowne&s;s of its Capaci|ty, or the Weakne&s;s of its Body. But there is no enduring to &s;ee Men enamoured only at the Sight of their own Impertinencies repeated, and to ob|&s;erve, as we may &s;ometimes, that they have a &s;e|cret Di&s;like of their Children for a Degeneracy from their very Crimes. Commend me to Lady <HI>Goodly;</HI> &s;he is equal to all her own Children, but prefers them to tho&s;e of all the World be&s;ide. My Lady is a perfect Hen in the Care of her Brood; &s;he fights and &s;quabbles with all that ap|pear where they come, but is wholly unbia&s;&s;ed in di&s;pen&s;ing her Favours among them. It is no &s;mall Pains &s;he is at to defame all the young Wo|men in her Neighbourhood by Vi&s;its, Whi&s;pers, Intimations, and Hear&s;ays; all which &s;he ends with thanking Heaven, that no one living is &s;o ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch obedient and well inclined Chil|dren as her &s;elf. Perhaps, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Betty</HI> cannot dance like Mrs. <HI>Frontinett,</HI> and it is no great Mat|ter whether &s;he does or not; but &s;he comes into a Room with a good Grace; though &s;he &s;ays it that &s;hould not, &s;he looks like a Gentlewoman. Then if Mrs. <HI>Rebecca</HI> is not &s;o talkative as the mighty Wit Mrs. <HI>Clapper,</HI> yet &s;he is di&s;creet, &s;he knows better what &s;he &s;ays when &s;he does &s;peak. If her Wit be &s;low, her Tongue never runs before it. This kind Parent lifts up her Eyes and Hands in Congratulation of her own good Fortune, and is maliciou&s;ly thankful that none of her Girls are like any of her Neighbours: But this Preference of her own to all others, is grounded upon an Impul&s;e of Nature; while tho&s;e who like one be|fore another of their own, are &s;o unpardonably unju&s;t, that it could hardly be equalled in the Children, though they preferred all the re&s;t of the World to &s;uch Parents. It is no unplea&s;ant Entertainment to &s;ee a Ball at a Dancing-School,
<PB N="204" REF="214">
and ob&s;erve the Joy of Relations when the young Ones, for whom they are concerned, are in Mo|tion. You need not be told whom the Dancers belong to. At their fir&s;t Appearance the Pa&s;&s;ion of their Parents are in their Faces, and there is al|ways a Nod of Approbation &s;tolen at a good Step, or a graceful Turn.</P>
<P>I remember among all my Acquaintance but one Man whom I have thought to live with his Children with Equanimity and a good Grace. He had Three Sons and One Daughter, whom he bred with all the Care imaginable in a liberal and ingenuous Way. I have often heard him &s;ay, He had the Weakne&s;s to love one much better than the other, but that he took as much Pains to cor|rect that as any other Criminal Pa&s;&s;ion that could ari&s;e in his Mind. His Method was, to make it the only Preten&s;ion in his Children to his Favour to be kind to each other; and he would tell them, That he who was the be&s;t Brother, he would reckon the be&s;t Son. This turned their Thoughts into an Emulation for the Superiority in kind and tender Affection towards each other. The Boys behaved them&s;elves very early with a Manly Friend&s;hip; and their Si&s;ter, in&s;tead of the gro&s;s Familiarities and impertinent Freedoms in Behaviour, u&s;ual in other Hou&s;es, was always treated by them with as much Complai&s;ance as any other young Lady of their Acquaintance. It was an un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure to vi&s;it or &s;it at Meal in that Family. I have often &s;een the old Man's Heart flow at his Eyes with Joy upon Occa&s;ions which would appear indifferent to &s;uch as were Strangers to the Turn of his Mind; but a very &s;light Accident, wherein he &s;aw his Children's Good-Will to one another, created in him the God-like Plea&s;ure of loving them, becau&s;e they loved each other. This great Command of him|&s;elf, in hiding his fir&s;t Impul&s;e to Partiality, at la&s;t improved to a &s;teady Ju&s;tice towards them;
<PB N="205" REF="215">
and that which at fir&s;t was but an Expedient to correct his Weakne&s;s, was afterwards the Mea|&s;ure of his Virtue.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, tho&s;e Parents who are in|tere&s;ted in the Care of one Child more than that of another, no longer de&s;erve the Name of Pa|rents, but are in Effect as childi&s;h as their Chil|dren, in having &s;uch unrea&s;onable and ungovern|ed Inclinations. A Father of this Sort has degra|ded him&s;elf into one of his own Offspring; for none but a Child would take Part in the Pa&s;&s;ions of Children.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin.</DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding by &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of your <HI>Tatlers,</HI> that you are a Per&s;on curious in Natural Knowledge, I thought it would not be unac|ceptable to you to give you the following Hi&s;to|ry of the Migration of Frogs into this Country. There is an ancient Tradition among the wild Philo&s;ophers of the Kingdom, That this whole I&s;land was once as much infe&s;ted by Frogs, as that wherein <HI>Whittington</HI> made his Fortune was by Mice. In&s;omuch that it is &s;aid, <HI>Mackdonald</HI> the Fir&s;t could no more &s;leep by rea&s;on of the&s;e <HI>Dutch</HI> Nightingales, (as they are called at <HI>Paris</HI>) than <HI>Pharaoh</HI> could when they croaked in his Bed-Chamber. It was in the Reign of this great Monarch that St. <HI>Patrick</HI> arrived in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> being as famous for de&s;troying Vermin as any Rat-catcher of our Times. If we may be|lieve the Tradition, he killed more in one Day than a Flock of Storks could have done in a Twelvemonth. From that Time for about Five hundred Years, there was not a Frog to be heard in <HI>Ireland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Bogs &s;till remained, which in former Ages had been &s;o plentifully &s;tocked with tho&s;e Inhabitants.</P>
<P>When the Arts began to flouri&s;h in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and that great Mo|narch had placed him&s;elf at the Head of the Royal Society, to lead them forward into the Di&s;coveries of Nature, it is &s;aid, That &s;everal Propo&s;als were laid before his Maje&s;ty for the importing of Frogs into <HI>Ireland.</HI> In order to it, a Virtuo&s;o of known Abilities was unanimou&s;ly elected by the Society, and intru&s;ted with the whole Management of that Affair. For this End he took along with him a &s;ound Able-bo|died Frog, of a &s;trong hale Con&s;titution, that
<PB N="207" REF="217">
had given Proofs of his Vigour by &s;everal Leaps which he made before that Learned Body. They took Ship, and &s;ailed together till they came within Sight of the Hill of <HI>Hoath,</HI> before the Frog di&s;covered any Symptoms of being in|di&s;po&s;ed by his Voyage: But as the Wind chop|ped about, and began to blow from the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, he grew Sea-&s;ick, or rather Land-&s;ick; for his learned Companion a&s;cribed it to the Particles of the Soil with which the Wind was impregnated. He was confirmed in his Con|jecture, when, upon the Wind's turning about, his Fellow Traveller &s;en&s;ibly recovered, and continued in good Health till his Arrival upon the Shore, where he &s;uddenly relap&s;ed, and ex|pired upon a <HI>Ring</HI>'s-<HI>End</HI> Car in his Way to <HI>Dub|lin.</HI> The &s;ame Experiment was repeated &s;eve|ral Times in that Reign, but to no Purpo&s;e. A Frog was never known to take Three Leaps upon <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Turf, before he &s;tretched him&s;elf out and died.</P>
<P>Whether it were that the Philos;ophers on this Side the Water de&s;paired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ocking the I&s;land with this u&s;eful Animal, or whether in the following Reign it was not thought proper to undo the Miracle of a Popi&s;h Saint, I do not hear of any further Progre&s;s made in this Af|fair till about Two Years after the Battle of the <HI>Boyne.</HI></P>
<P>It was then that an ingenious Phy&s;ician, to the Honour as well as Improvement of his Native Country, performed what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had been &s;o long attempting in vain. This learned Man, with the Hazard of his Life, made a Voyage to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> where he filled &s;everal Barrels with the choice&s;t Spawn of Frogs that could be found in tho&s;e Parts. This Cargo he brought over very carefully, and afterwards di&s;po&s;ed of it in &s;everal warm Beds that he thought mo&s;t capable of bringing it to Life. The Doctor was
<PB N="208" REF="218">
a very ingenious Phy&s;ician, and a very good Prote&s;tant; for which Rea&s;on, to &s;how his Zeal again&s;t Popery, he placed &s;ome of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Spawn in the very Fountain that is dedicated to the Saint, and known by the Name of St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s <HI>Well,</HI> where the&s;e Animals had the Impudence to make their fir&s;t Appearance. They have &s;ince that Time very much increa&s;ed and multiplied in all the Neighbourhood of this City. We have here &s;ome curious Enquirers into Natural Hi&s;tory who ob&s;erve their Motions, with a De&s;ign to compute in how many Years they will be able to hop from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Wex|ford;</HI> tho', as I am inform'd, not one of them has yet pa&s;&s;ed the Mountains of <HI>Wicklow.</HI></P>
<P>I am further informed, that &s;everal Gra&s;iers of the County of <HI>Cork</HI> have entered into a Pro|ject of planting a Colony in tho&s;e Parts, at the In&s;tance of the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants: And I know not but the &s;ame De&s;ign may be on Foot in other Parts of the Kingdom, if the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation do not think fit to prohibit the further Importation of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frogs. I am,</P>

<P>There is no Study more becoming a rational Creature, than that of Natural Philo&s;ophy; but as &s;everal of our modern Virtuo&s;o's manage it, their Speculations do not &s;o much tend to open and enlarge the Mind, as to contract and fix it upon Trifles.</P>
<P>This in <HI>England</HI> is in a great Mea&s;ure owing to the worthy Elections that are &s;o frequently made in our Royal Society. They &s;eem to be in a Con|federacy again&s;t Men of polite Genius, noble Thought, and diffu&s;ive Learning; and chu&s;e into their A&s;&s;emblies &s;uch as have no Pretence to Wi&s;|dom, but Want of Wit; or to natural Know|ledge,

but Ignorance of every Thing el&s;e. I have made Ob&s;ervations in this Matter &s;o long, that when I meet with a young Fellow that is an humble Admirer of the Sciences, but more dull than the re&s;t of the Company, I conclude him to be a Fellow of the Royal Society.</P>

<P>COming Home la&s;t Night before my u&s;ual Hour, I took a Book into my Hand, in or|der to divert my &s;elf with it till Bed-time. <HI>Mil|ton</HI> chanced to be my Author, who&s;e admirable Poem of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> &s;erves, at once, to fill the Mind with plea&s;ing Idea's, and with good Thoughts, and was therefore the mo&s;t proper Book for my Purpo&s;e. I was amu&s;ing my &s;elf with that beautiful Pa&s;&s;age in which the Poet re|pre&s;ents <HI>Eve</HI> &s;leeping by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Side, with the Devil &s;itting at her Ear, and in&s;piring evil Thoughts under the Shape of a Toad. <HI>Ithuriel,</HI> one of the Guardian Angels of the Place, walking his Nightly Rounds, &s;aw the great Enemy of Mankind hid in this loath&s;ome Animal, which he touched with his Spear. This Spear being of a Cele&s;tial Temper, had &s;uch a &s;ecret Virtue in it, that whatever it was applied to, immediately flung off all Di&s;gui&s;e, and appeared in its natu|ral Figure. I am afraid the Reader will not par|don me if I content my &s;elf with explaining the
<PB N="210" REF="220">
Pa&s;&s;age in Pro&s;e, without giving it in the Author's own inimitable Words:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; On he led his radiant Files,</L>
<L>Dazzling the Morn: The&s;e to the Bower direct,</L>
<L>In Search of whom they &s;ought. Him there they found,</L>
<L>Squat like a Toad, clo&s;e at the Ear of <HI>Eve;</HI></L>
<L>E&s;&s;aying by his devili&s;h Art to reach</L>
<L>The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge</L>
<L>Illu&s;ions as he li&s;t, Phanta&s;ms and Dreams;</L>
<L>Or if, in&s;piring Venom, he might taint</L>
<L>The Animal Spirits (that from pure Blood ari&s;e</L>
<L>Like gentle Breaths from Rivers pure) thence rai&s;e</L>
<L>At lea&s;t di&s;temper'd, di&s;contented Thoughts,</L>
<L>Vain Hopes, vain Aims, inordinate De&s;tres,</L>
<L>Blown up with high Conceits, ingendring Pride.</L>
<L>Him thus intent, <HI>Ithuriel</HI> with his Spear</L>
<L>Touch'd lightly; for no Fal&s;hood can endure</L>
<L>Touch of Cele&s;tial Temper, but returns</L>
<L>Of Force to his own Likene&s;s. Up he &s;tarts,</L>
<L>Di&s;cover'd and &s;urpriz'd. As when a Spark</L>
<L>Lights on a Heap of nitrous Powder, laid</L>
<L>Fit for the Tun, &s;ome Magazine to &s;tore</L>
<L>Again&s;t a rumour'd War, the &s;mutty Grain,</L>
<L>With &s;udden Blaze diffus'd, inflames the Air;</L>
<L>So &s;tarted up in his own Shape the Fiend.</L></Q>
<P>I could not forbear thinking how happy a Man would be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Spear; or what an Advantage it would be to a Mini&s;ter of State, were he Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a White Staff. It would let him di&s;cover his Friends from his Enemies, Men of Abilities from Pretenders: It would hin|der him from being impo&s;ed upon by Appea|rances and Profe&s;&s;ions, and might be made u&s;e of as a Kind of State Te&s;t, which no Artifice could elude.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts made very lively Impre&s;&s;ions on my Imagination, which were improv'd, in|&s;tead of being defaced by Sleep, and produced in me the following Dream: I was no &s;ooner fallen
<PB N="211" REF="221">
a&s;leep, but, methoughts, the Angel <HI>Ithuriel</HI> ap|peared to me, and with a Smile that &s;till added to his Cele&s;tial Beauty, made me a Pre&s;ent of the Spear which he held in his Hand, and di&s;appear|ed. To make Trial of it, I went into a Place of publick Re&s;ort.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on that pa&s;&s;ed by me, was a Lady that had a particular Shyne&s;s in the Ca&s;t of her Eye, and a more than ordinary Re&s;ervedne&s;s in all the Parts of her Behaviour. She &s;eemed to look upon Man as an ob&s;cene Creature, with a certain Scorn and Fear of him. In the Height of her Airs I touched her gently with my Wand, when, to my un&s;peakable Surprize, &s;he fell upon her Back, and kick'd up her Heels in &s;uch a Man|ner, as made me blu&s;h in my Sleep. As I was ha&s;ting away from this undi&s;gui&s;ed Prude, I &s;aw a Lady in earne&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e with another, and overheard her &s;ay with &s;ome Vehemence, Never tell me of him, for I am re&s;olv'd to die a Vir|gin! I had a Curio&s;ity to try her; but as &s;oon as I laid my Wand upon her Head, &s;he immediately fell in Labour. My Eyes were diverted from her by a Man and his Wife, who walked near me Hand in Hand after a very loving Manner. I gave each of them a gentle Tap, and the next In&s;tant &s;aw the Woman in Breeches, and the Man with a Fan in his Hand. It would be tedious to de&s;cribe the long Series of Metamorpho&s;es that I entertained my &s;elf with in my Night's Adven|ture, of Whigs di&s;gui&s;ed in Tories, and Tories in Whigs; Men in Red Coats that denounced Ter|ror in their Countenances, trembling at the Touch of my Spear; others in Black with Peace in their Mouths, but Swords in their Hands. I could tell Stories of Noblemen changed into U&s;urers, and Magi&s;trates into Beadles; of Free-Thinkers into Penitents, and Reformers into Whorema&s;ters. I mu&s;t not however omit the Mention of a grave Citizen that pa&s;&s;ed by me with an huge Cla&s;ped
<PB N="212" REF="222">
Bible under his Arm, and a Band of a mo&s;t im|moderate Breadth; but upon a Touch on the Shoulder, he let drop his Book, and fell a picking my Pocket.</P>
<P>In the general I ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who ap|peared good, often di&s;appointed my Expectation; but that on the contrary, tho&s;e who appeared ve|ry bad, &s;till grew wor&s;e upon the Experiment; as the Toad in <HI>Milton,</HI> which one would have thought the mo&s;t deformed Part of the Creation, at <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s Stroke, became more deformed, and &s;tarted up into a Devil.</P>
<P>Among all the Per&s;ons that I touched, there was but one who &s;tood the Te&s;t of my Wand; and after many Repetitions of the Stroke, &s;tuck to his Form, and remained &s;teady and fixed in his fir&s;t Appearance. This was a young Man who boa&s;ted of foul Di&s;tempers, wild Debauches, In|&s;ults upon holy Men, and Affronts to Religion.</P>
<P>My Heart was extremely troubled at this Vi|&s;ion: The Contemplation of the whole Species, &s;o entirely &s;unk in Corruption, filled my Mind with a Melancholy that is inexpre&s;&s;ible, and my Di&s;coveries &s;till added to my Affliction.</P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t of the&s;e Sorrows which I had in my Heart, methoughts there pa&s;&s;ed by me a Cou|ple of Coaches with Purple Liveries. There &s;ate in each of them a Per&s;on with a very venerable A&s;pect. At the Appearance of them, the People who were gathered round me in great Multi|tudes divided into Parties, as they were di&s;po&s;ed to favour either of tho&s;e reverend Per&s;ons: The Enemies of one of them begged me to touch him with my Wand, and a&s;&s;ured me, I &s;hould &s;ee his Lawn converted into a Cloak. The oppo&s;ite Par|ty told me with as much A&s;&s;urance, That if I laid my Wand upon the other, I &s;hould &s;ee his Garments embroidered with Flower-de-Luces, and his Head covered with a Cardinal's Cap. I made the Experiment, and to my great Joy, &s;aw
<PB N="213" REF="223">
them both, without any Change, di&s;tributing their Ble&s;&s;ings to the People, and praying for tho&s;e who had reviled them. Is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I, that good Men, who are &s;o few in Number, &s;hould be divided among them&s;elves, and give better Quarter to the Vicious that are in their Party, than the mo&s;t &s;trictly Virtuous who are out of it? Are the Ties of Faction above tho&s;e of Religion?&mdash;I was going on in my Soli|loquies, but &s;ome &s;udden Accident awakened me, when I found my Hand gra&s;ped, but my Spear gone. The Reflection on &s;o very odd a Dream made me figure to my &s;elf, What a &s;trange Face the World would bear, &s;hould all Mankind appear in their proper Shapes and Characters, without Hypocri&s;y and Di&s;gui&s;e? I am afraid, the Earth we live upon would appear to other in|tellectual Beings no better than a Planet peopled with Mon&s;ters. This &s;hould, methinks, in&s;pire us with an hone&s;t Ambition of recommending our &s;elves to tho&s;e invi&s;ible Spies, and of being what we would appear. There was one Circum|&s;tance in my foregoing Dream which I at fir&s;t intended to conceal; but upon &s;econd Thoughts, I cannot look upon my &s;elf as a candid and im|partial Hi&s;torian, if I do not acquaint my Reader, that upon taking <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s Spear into my Hand, though I was before an old decrepid Fellow, I appeared a very hand&s;ome, jolly, black Man. But I know my Enemies will &s;ay, this is prai&s;ing my own Beauty, for which Rea&s;on I will &s;peak no more of it.</P>

<P>STorms at Sea are &s;o frequently de&s;cribed by the ancient Poets, and copied by the Moderns, that whenever I find the Winds begin to ri&s;e in a new Heroick Poem, I generally skip a Leaf or Two till I come into Fair Weather. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI> is a Ma&s;ter-piece in this Kind, and is in|deed &s;o naturally drawn, that one who has made a Voyage can &s;carce read it without being Sea|&s;ick.</P>
<P>Land Showers are no le&s;s frequent among the Poets than the former, but I remember none of them which have not fallen in the Country; for which Rea&s;on they are generally filled with the Lowings of Oxen, and the Bleatings of Sheep, and very often embelli&s;hed with a Rainbow.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Land Shower</HI> is likewi&s;e the be&s;t in its Kind: It is indeed a Shower of Con&s;equence, and contributes to the main De&s;ign of the Poem, by cutting off a tedious Ceremonial, and bringing Matters to a &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion between Two Po|tentates of different Sexes. My ingenious Kin&s;|man Mr. <HI>Humphry Wag&s;taff,</HI> who treats of every Subject after a Manner that no other Author has done, and better than any other can do, has &s;ent me the De&s;cription of a City Shower.

<P>IT is ridiculous for any Man to critici&s;e on the Works of another, who has not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his own Performances. A Judge would make but an indifferent Figure who had never been known at the Bar. <HI>Cicero</HI> was reputed the greate&s;t Orator of his Age and Country before he wrote a Book <HI>De Oratore;</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> the great|e&s;t Poet before he publi&s;hed his <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI> This Ob&s;ervation ari&s;es naturally in any one who ca&s;ts his Eye upon this la&s;t mentioned Author, where he will find the Critici&s;ms placed in the latter End of his Book, that is, after the fine&s;t Odes and Satyrs in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>A Modern, who&s;e Name I &s;hall not mention, becau&s;e I would not make a &s;illy Paper &s;ell, was born a Critick and an Examiner, and, like one of the Race of the Serpent's Teeth, came into the World with a Sword in his Hand. His Works put me in mind of the Story that is told of a <HI>Ger|man</HI> Monk, who was taking a Catalogue of a Friend's Library, and meeting with a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Book in it, entered it under the Title of, <HI>A Book that has the Beginning where the End &s;hould be.</HI> This Author, in the la&s;t of his Crudities, has ama&s;|&s;ed together a Heap of Quotations, to prove that <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were both of them mode&s;ter Men than my &s;elf, and if his Works were to live as long as mine, they might po&s;&s;ibly give Po&s;te|rity a Notion, that <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> was a very
<PB N="218" REF="228">
conceited old Fellow, and as vain a Man as either <HI>Tully</HI> or Sir <HI>Francis Bacon.</HI> Had this &s;erious Wri|ter fallen upon me only, I could have overlook|ed it; but to &s;ee <HI>Cicero</HI> abu&s;ed, is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, what I cannot bear. The Cen&s;ure he pa&s;&s;es upon this great Man runs thus; <HI>The Itch of being very Abu&s;ive, is almo&s;t in&s;eparable from Vain-Glory.</HI> Tully <HI>has the&s;e Two Faults in &s;o high a Degree, that nothing but his being the be&s;t Writer in the World can make Amends for them.</HI> The &s;currilous Wretch goes on to &s;ay I am as bad as <HI>Tully.</HI> His Words are the&s;e; <HI>And yet the</HI> Tatler, <HI>in his Paper of</HI> Sep|tember 26, <HI>has out-done him in both. He &s;peaks of him&s;elf with more Arrogance, and with more In&s;o|lence of others.</HI> I am afraid by his Di&s;cour&s;e, this Gentleman has no more read <HI>Plutarch</HI> than he has <HI>Tully.</HI> If he had, he would have ob&s;erved a Pa&s;|&s;age in that Hi&s;torian, wherein he has with great Delicacy di&s;tingui&s;h'd between Two Pa&s;&s;ions which are u&s;ually complicated in Humane Nature, and which an ordinary Writer would not have thought of &s;eparating. Not having my <HI>Greek</HI> Spectacles by me, I &s;hall quote the Pa&s;&s;age Word for Word as I find it tran&s;lated to my Hand. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, tho' he was intemperately fond of his own Prai&s;e, yet he was very free from envying others, and mo&s;t li|berally profu&s;e in commending both the Ancients and his Contemporaries, as is to be under&s;tood by his Wri|tings; and many of tho&s;e Sayings are &s;till recorded, as that concerning</HI> Ari&s;totle, <HI>That he was a River of flowing Gold: Of</HI> Plato<HI>'s Dialogue, That if</HI> Jupi|ter <HI>were to &s;peak, he would di&s;cour&s;e as he did.</HI> Theophra&s;tus <HI>he was wont to call his peculiar De|light; and being asked, Which of</HI> Demo&s;thenes <HI>his Orations he liked be&s;t? He an&s;wered, The longe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as for the Eminent Men of his own Time, ei|ther for Eloquence or Philo&s;ophy, there was not one of them which he did not, by writing or &s;peaking fa|vourably of, render more illu&s;trious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="229">
Thus the Critick tells us, That <HI>Cicero</HI> was ex|ce&s;&s;ively vain-glorious and abu&s;ive; <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that he was vain, but not abu&s;ive. Let the Reader be|lieve which of them he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>After this he complains to the World, that I call him Names; and that in my Pa&s;&s;ion I &s;aid, He was <HI>a Flea, a Lou&s;e, an Owl, a Bat, a &s;mall Wit, a Scribbler, and a Nibbler.</HI> When he has thus be|&s;poken his Reader's Pity, he falls into that admi|rable Vein of Mirth, which I &s;hall &s;et down at length, it being an exqui&s;ite Piece of Raillery, and written in great Gaiety of Heart. <HI>After this Li&s;t of Names,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Flea, Lou&s;e, Owl, Bat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) <HI>I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him &s;ay, that he has hitherto kept his Temper pretty well; I wonder how he will write when he has lo&s;t his Temper? I &s;uppo&s;e, as he now is very angry and unmannerly, he will then be ex|ceeding courteous and good-humoured.</HI> If I can out-live this Raillery, I &s;hall be able to bear any Thing.</P>
<P>There is a Method of Critici&s;m made U&s;e of by this Author, (for I &s;hall take Care how I call him a Scribbler again) which may turn into Ridicule any Work that was ever written, wherein there is a Variety of Thoughts: This the Reader will ob&s;erve in the following Words; <HI>He</HI> (meaning me) <HI>is &s;o intent upon being &s;omething extraordina|ry, that he &s;carce knows what he would be; and is as fruitful in his Similes, as a Brother of his whom I lately took Notice of. In the Compa&s;s of a few Lines he compares him&s;elf to a Fox, to</HI> Daniel Burge&s;s, <HI>to the Knight of the Red Cro&s;s, to an Oak with Ivy about it, and to a great Man with an Equipage.</HI> I think my &s;elf as much honoured by being joined in this Part of his Paper with the Gentleman whom he here calls my Brother, as I am in the Beginning of it, by being mentioned with <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>It is very hard that a Man cannot publi&s;h Ten Papers without &s;tealing from him&s;elf; but to &s;how you that this is only a Knack of Writing, and that
<PB N="220" REF="230">
the Author is got into a certain Road of Critici&s;m, I &s;hall &s;et down his Remarks on the Works of the Gentleman whom he here glances upon, as they &s;tand in his 6th Paper, and de&s;ire the Reader to compare them with the foregoing Pa&s;&s;age upon mine.</P>
<P><HI>In Thirty Lines his Patron is a River, the</HI> Primum Mobile, <HI>a Pilot, a Victim, the Sun, any Thing, and Nothing. He be&s;tows Increa&s;e, conceals his Source, makes the Machine move, teaches to &s;teer, expiates our Offences, rai&s;es Vapours, and looks larger as he &s;ets.</HI></P>
<P>What Poem can be &s;afe from this Sort of Criti|ci&s;m? I think I was never in my Life &s;o much offended as at a Wag whom I once met with in a Coffee-hou&s;e: He had in his Hand one of the Mi&s;cellanies, and was reading the following &s;hort Copy of Ver&s;es, which, without Flattery to the Author, is (I think) as beautiful in its Kind as any one in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Flavia</HI> the lea&s;t and flight e&s;t Toy</L>
<L>Can with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Art employ.</L>
<L>This Fan in meaner Hands would prove</L>
<L>An Engine of &s;mall Force in Love;</L>
<L>But &s;he with &s;uch an Air and Mien,</L>
<L>Not to be told, or &s;afely &s;een,</L>
<L>Directs its wanton Motions &s;o,</L>
<L>That it wounds more than <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Bow;</L>
<L>Gives Coolne&s;s to the matchle&s;s Dame,</L>
<L>To ev'ry other Brea&s;t a Flame.</L></Q>
<P>When this Coxcomb had done reading them, Heyday! &s;ays he, What In&s;trument is this that <HI>Flavia</HI> employs in &s;uch a Manner as is not to be told, nor &s;afely &s;een? In Ten Lines it is a Toy, a <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Bow, a Fan, and an Engine in Love. It has wanton Motions, it wounds, it cools, and in|flames.</P>
<P>Such Critici&s;ms make a Man of Sen&s;e &s;ick, and a Fool merry.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="231">
The next Paragraph of the Paper we are talk|ing of, falls upon &s;ome Body whom I am at a Lo&s;s to gue&s;s at: But I find the whole Invective turns upon a Man who (it &s;eems) has been impri|&s;oned for Debt. Whoever he was, I mu&s;t hear|tily pity him; but at the &s;ame Time mu&s;t put the Examiner in Mind, that notwith&s;tanding he is a Critick, he &s;till ought to remember he is a Chri|&s;tian. Poverty was never thought a proper Sub|ject for Ridicule; and I do not remember that I ever met with a Satyr upon a Beggar.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e little Retortings of my own Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, of <HI>being dull by De&s;ign, witty in</HI> October, <HI>&s;hining, excelling,</HI> and &s;o forth; they are the com|mon Cavils of every Witlin, who has no other Method of &s;howing his Parts, but by little Varia|tions and Repetitions of the Man's Words whom he attacks.</P>
<P>But the Truth of it is, the Paper before me, not only in this Particular, but in its very E&s;&s;ence, is like <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Eccho:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Quae nec reticere loquenti,</L>
<L>Nec prior ip&s;a loqui didicit. &mdash;</L></Q>
<P>I &s;hould not have de&s;erved the Character of a Cen&s;or, had I not animadverted upon the above|mentioned Author by a gentle Cha&s;ti&s;ement: But I know my Reader will not pardon me, unle&s;s I declare, that nothing of this Nature for the future (unle&s;s it be written with &s;ome Wit) &s;hall divert me from my Care of the Publick.</P>

<P>I DO not remember that in any of my Lucu|brations I have touched upon that u&s;eful Sci|ence of Phy&s;ick, notwith&s;tanding I have declared my &s;elf more than once a Profe&s;&s;or of it. I have indeed joined the Study of A&s;trology with it, be|cau&s;e I never knew a Phy&s;ician recommend him|&s;elf to the Publick who had not a Si&s;ter Art to embelli&s;h his Knowledge in Medicine. It has been commonly ob&s;erved in Compliment to the Inge|nious of our Profe&s;&s;ion, that <HI>Apollo</HI> was God of Ver&s;e as well as Phy&s;ick; and in all Ages the mo&s;t celebrated Practitioners of our Country were the particular Favourites of the Mu&s;es. Poetry to Phy&s;ick is indeed like the Gilding to a Pill; it makes the Art &s;hine, and covers the Severity of the Doctor with the Agreeablene&s;s of the Com|panion.</P>
<P>The very Foundation of Poety is good Sen&s;e, if we may allow <HI>Harace</HI> to be a Judge of the Art. <Q><L>Scribendi recte &s;apere e&s;t, &amp; Principium, &amp; Fons.</L></Q>
And if &s;o, we have Rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;ame Man who writes well can pre&s;cribe well, if he has applied him&s;elf to the Study of both. Be|&s;ides, when we &s;ee a Man making Profe&s;&s;ion of Two different Sciences, it is natural for us to be|lieve he is no Pretender in that which we are not Judges of when we find him skilful in that which we under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="233">
Ordinary Quacks and Charlatans are throughly &s;en&s;ible how nece&s;&s;ary it is to &s;upport them&s;elves by the&s;e collateral A&s;&s;i&s;tances, and therefore al|ways lay their Claim to &s;ome &s;upernumerary Ac|compli&s;hments which are wholly foreign to their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About 20 Years ago, it was impo&s;&s;ible to walk the Streets without having an Adverti&s;ement thru&s;t into your Hand of a Doctor <HI>who was arrived at the Knowledge of the Green and Red Dragon, and had di&s;covered the Female Fern Seed.</HI> No Body ever knew what this meant; but the Green and Red Dragon &s;o amu&s;ed the People, that the Doctor li|ved very comfortably upon them. About the &s;ame Time there was pa&s;ted a very hard Word upon every Corner of the Streets. This, to the be&s;t of my Remembrance, was
<Q>TETRACHYMAGOGON.</Q>
Which drew great Shoals of Spectators about it, who read the Bill that it introduced with un|&s;peakable Curio&s;ity; and when they were &s;ick, would have no Body but this learned Man for their Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>I once received an Adverti&s;ement of one <HI>who had &s;tudied Thirty Years by Candle-light for the Good of his Countrymen.</HI> He might have &s;tudied Twice as long by Day-light, and never have been taken Notice of: But Lucubrations cannot be over-valued. There are &s;ome who have gained them&s;elves great Reputation for Phy&s;ick by their Birth, as the <HI>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son;</HI> and others by not being born at all, as the <HI>Unborn Doctor,</HI> who, I hear, is lately gone the Way of his Patients, having died worth Five Hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> though he was not <HI>born</HI> to a Halfpenny.</P>
<P>My ingenious Friend Doctor <HI>Saffold,</HI> &s;ucceeded my old Contemporary Doctor <HI>Lilly</HI> in the Studies both of Phy&s;ick and A&s;trology, to which he ad|ded
<PB N="224" REF="234">
that of Poetry, as was to be &s;een both upon the Sign where he lived, and in the Bills which he di&s;tributed. He was &s;ucceeded by Doctor <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> who era&s;ed the Ver&s;es of his Predece&s;&s;or out of the Sign-Po&s;t, and &s;ub&s;tituted in their Stead Two of his own, which were as follow:</P>
<Q><L>Within this Place</L>
<L>Lives Doctor <HI>Ca&s;e.</HI></L></Q>
<P>He is &s;aid to have got more by this Di&s;tich, than Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> did by all his Works. There would be no End of enumerating the &s;everal imaginary Per|fections and unaccountable Artifices by which this Tribe of Men en&s;nare the Minds of the Vulgar, and gain Crowds of Admirers. I have &s;een the whole Front of a Mountebank's Stage from one End to the other faced with Patents, Certificates, Medals, and Great Seals, by which the &s;everal Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> have te&s;tified their particular Re|&s;pect and E&s;teem for the Doctor. Every great Man with a &s;ounding Title has been his Patient. I be|lieve I have &s;een Twenty Mountebanks that have given Phy&s;ick to the Czar of <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> The Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> e&s;capes no better. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> was likewi&s;e a very good Patient.</P>
<P>This great Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Doctor draws upon him much Good-Will from his Audience; and it is Ten to One, but if any of them be trou|bled with an aching Tooth, his Ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a Per&s;on who has had &s;o many Princes, Kings, and Emperors, under his Hands.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not leave this Subject without ob&s;erving, that as Phy&s;icians are apt to deal in Poetry, Apo|thecaries endeavour to recommend them&s;elves by Oratory, and are therefore without Controver&s;y the mo&s;t eloquent Per&s;ons in the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Na|tion. I would not willingly di&s;courage any of the Arts, e&s;pecially that of which I am an humble Pro|fe&s;&s;or; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for the Good of my
<PB N="225" REF="235">
native Country, I could wi&s;h there might be a Su&s;|pen&s;ion of Phy&s;ick for &s;ome Years, that our King|dom, which has been &s;o much exhau&s;ted by the Wars, might have Leave to recruit it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As for my &s;elf, the only Phy&s;ick which has brought me &s;afe to almo&s;t the Age of Man, and which I pre&s;cribe to all my Friends, is Ab&s;tinence. This is certainly the be&s;t Phy&s;ick for Prevention, and very often the mo&s;t effectual again&s;t a pre&s;ent Di&s;temper. In &s;hort, my <HI>Recipe</HI> is, <HI>Take nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Were the Body Politick to be phy&s;ick'd like particular Per&s;ons, I &s;hould venture to pre&s;cribe to it after the &s;ame Manner. I remember when our wholeI&s;land was &s;haken with an Earthquake &s;ome Years ago, there was an impudent Mountebank who &s;old Pills which (as he told the Country People) were very good again&s;t an Earthquake. It may perhaps be thought as ab&s;urd to pre&s;cribe a Diet for the allaying Popular Commotions, and National Ferments. But I am verily per&s;waded, that if in &s;uch a Ca&s;e a whole People were to en|ter into a Cour&s;e of Ab&s;tinence, and eat nothing but Water-gruel for a Fortnight, it would abate the Rage and Animo&s;ity of Parties, and not a lit|tle contribute to the Cure of a di&s;tracted Nation. Such a Fa&s;t would have a natural Tendency to the procuring of tho&s;e Ends for which a Fa&s;t is u&s;ually proclaimed. If any Man has a Mind to enter on &s;uch a voluntary Ab&s;tinence, it might not be improper to give him the Caution of <HI>Py|thagoras</HI> in particular:</P>
<Q>Ab&s;tine a Fabis.</Q>
<Q>' Ab&s;tain from Beans.</Q>

<P>A Method of &s;pending one's Time agreeably is a Thing &s;o little &s;tudied, that the common Amu&s;ement of our young Gentlemen (e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are at a Di&s;tance from tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Breeding) is Drinking. This Way of Entertain|ment has Cu&s;tom of its Side; but as much as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few Companies that have been guilty of Exce&s;s this Way, where there have not happened more Acci|dents which make again&s;t, than for the Continu|ance of it. It is very common that Events ari&s;e from a Debauch which are fatal, and always &s;uch as are di&s;agreeable. With all a Man's Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e about him, his Tongue is apt to utter Things out of meer Gaiety of Heart which may di&s;plea&s;e his be&s;t Friends. Who then would tru&s;t him&s;elf to the Power of Wine, without &s;aying more again&s;t it, than that it rai&s;es the Imagination, and depre&s;&s;es the Judgment. Were there only this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, That we are le&s;s Ma&s;ters of our &s;elves when we drink in the lea&s;t Proportion above the Exigencies of Thir&s;t; I &s;ay, were this all that could be objected, it were &s;ufficient to make us abhor this Vice. But we may go on to &s;ay, that as he who drinks but a little is not Ma|&s;ter of him&s;elf, &s;o he who drinks much is a Slave to him&s;elf. As for my Part, I ever e&s;teemed a Drunkard of all vicious Per&s;ons the mo&s;t vicious: For if our Actions are to be weighed and con&s;i|dered according to the Intention of them, what can we think of him who puts him&s;elf into a Cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="227" REF="237">
wherein he can have no Intention at all, but incapacitates him&s;elf for the Duties and Of|fices of Life, by a Su&s;pen&s;ion of all his Faculties. If a Man con&s;idered, that he cannot under the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of Drink be a Friend, a Gentleman, a Ma|&s;ter, or a Subject; that he has &s;o long bani&s;hed him&s;elf from all that is dear, and given up all that is &s;acred to him, he would even then think of a Debauch with Horror: But when he looks &s;till further, and acknowledges, that he is not only expelled out of all the Relations of Life, but al&s;o liable to offend again&s;t them all, What Words can expre&s;s the Terror and Dete&s;tation he would have of &s;uch a Condition? And yet he owns all this of him&s;elf who &s;ays he was drunk la&s;t Night.</P>
<P>As I have all along per&s;i&s;ted in it, that all the Vicious in general are in a State of Death, &s;o I think I may add to the Non-Exi&s;tence of Drunk|ards, that they died by their own Hands. He is certainly as guilty of Suicide who peri&s;hes by a &s;low, as he that is di&s;patched by an immediate, Poi&s;on. In my la&s;t Lucubration I propo&s;ed the general U&s;e of Water-gruel, and hinted, that it might not be ami&s;s at this very Sea&s;on: But as there are &s;ome, who&s;e Ca&s;es, in regard to their Families, will not admit of Delay, I have u&s;ed my Intere&s;t in &s;everal Wards of the City, that the whole&s;ome Re&s;torative above-mentioned may be given in Tavern Kitchens to all the Mornings Draught Men within the Walls when they call for Wine before Noon. For a further Re&s;traint and Mark upon &s;uch Per&s;ons, I have given Orders, that in all the Offices where Policies are drawn upon Lives, it &s;hall be added to the Article which prohibits that the Nominee &s;hould cro&s;s the Sea, the Words, <HI>Provided al&s;o, That the above-mention|ed</HI> A. B. <HI>&s;hall not drink before Dinner during the Term mentioned in this Indenture.</HI></P>
<P>I am not without Hopes but by this Method I &s;hall bring &s;ome un&s;izeable Friends of mine into
<PB N="228" REF="238">
Shape and Breath, as well as others who are languid and con&s;umptive into Health and Vigour. Mo&s;t of the Self-Murderers whom I yet hinted at, are &s;uch as pre&s;erve a certain Regularity in taking their Poi&s;on, and make it mix pretty well with their Food: But the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of tho&s;e who de&s;troy them&s;elves, are &s;uch as in their Youth fall into this Sort of Debauchery, and contract a certain Unea&s;ine&s;s of Spirit, which is not to be diverted but by Tippling as often as they can fall into Company in the Day, and conclude with downright Drunkenne&s;s at Night. The&s;e Gen|tlemen never know the Satisfaction of Youth, but skip the Years of Manhood, and are decrepid &s;oon after they are of Age. I was Godfather to one of the&s;e old Fellows. He is now Three and Thirty, which is the Grand Climacterick of a young Drunkard. I went to vi&s;it the crazy Wretch this Morning, with no other Purpo&s;e but to rally him under the Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s of being &s;ober.</P>
<P>But as out Faults are double when they affect others be&s;ides our &s;elves, &s;o this Vice is &s;till more odious in a married than a &s;ingle Man. He that is the Husband of a Woman of Honour, and comes Home overloaded with Wine, is &s;till more con|temptible in Proportion to the Regard we have to the unhappy Con&s;ort of his Be&s;tiality. The Ima|gination cannot &s;hape to its &s;elf any Thing more mon&s;trous and unnatural than the Familiarities between Drunkenne&s;s and Cha&s;tity. The wretch|ed <HI>A&s;traea,</HI> who is the Perfection of Beauty and In|nocence, has long been thus condemned for Life. The Romantick Tales of Virgins devoted to the Jaws of the Mon&s;ters, have nothing in them &s;o terrible as the Gift of <HI>A&s;traea</HI> to that Bacchanal.</P>
<P>The Reflection of &s;uch a Match as &s;potle&s;s In|nocence with abandoned Lewdne&s;s, is what puts this Vice in the wor&s;t Figure it can bear with Re|gard to others; but when it is looked upon with Re&s;pect only to the Drunkard him&s;elf, it has De|formities
<PB N="229" REF="239">
enough to make it di&s;agreeable, which may be &s;ummed up in a Word, by allowing, that he who re&s;igns his Rea&s;on, is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the Want of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Among many other Enormities, there are Two in the following Letters which I think &s;hould be &s;uddenly amended; but &s;ince they are Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion only, I &s;hall not make Remarks upon them till I find the Delinquents per&s;i&s;t in their Errors; and the in&s;erting the Letters them&s;elves &s;hall be all their pre&s;ent Admonition.</P>

<P>IT was with very great Di&s;plea&s;ure I heard this Day a Man &s;ay of a Companion of his with an Air of Approbation, <HI>You know</HI> Tom <HI>never fails of &s;aying a &s;pightful Thing.</HI> He has a great deal of Wit, but Satyr is his particular Talent. <HI>Did you mind how he put the young Fellow out of Counte|nance that pretended to talk to him?</HI> Such imper|tinent Applau&s;es, which one meets with every Day, put me upon con&s;idering what true Raillery and Satyr were in them&s;elves; and this, me|thought, occurred to me from Reflection upon the great and excellent Per&s;ons that were admi|red for Talents this Way. When I had ran over &s;everal &s;uch in my Thoughts, I concluded, (how|ever unaccountable the A&s;&s;ertion might appear at fir&s;t Sight) that Good-Nature was an e&s;&s;ential Quality in a Satyri&s;t, and that all the Sentiments which are beautiful in this Way of Writing mu&s;t proceed from that Quality in the Author. Good-Nature produces a Di&s;dain of all Ba&s;ene&s;s, Vice, and Folly, which prompts them to expre&s;s them|&s;elves with Smartne&s;s again&s;t the Errors of Men, without Bitterne&s;s towards their Per&s;ons. This Quality keeps the Mind in Equanimity, and ne|ver lets an Offence un&s;ea&s;onably throw a Man out of his Character. When <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;aid, He that did not hate <HI>Bavius</HI> might love <HI>Maevius,</HI> he
<PB N="232" REF="242">
was in perfect good Humour, and was not &s;o much moved at their Ab&s;urdities, as pa&s;&s;ionately to call them Sots or Blockheads in a direct In|vective, but laughed at them with a Delicacy of Scorn, without any Mixture of Anger.</P>
<P><HI>The be&s;t good Man, with the wor&s;t-natured Mu&s;e,</HI> was the Character among us of a Gentleman as famous for his Humanity as his Wit.</P>
<P>The ordinary Subjects for Satyr are &s;uch as in|cite the greate&s;t Indignation in the be&s;t Tem|pers, and con&s;equently Men of &s;uch a Make are the be&s;t qualified for &s;peaking of the Offences in Humane Life. The&s;e Men can behold Vice and Folly when they injure Per&s;ons to whom they are wholly unacquainted, with the &s;ame Severity as others re&s;ent the Ills they do them&s;elves. A good-natured Man cannot &s;ee an over-bearing Fellow put a ba&s;hful Man of Merit out of Coun|tenance, or out&s;trip him in the Pur&s;uit of any Advantage; but he is on Fire to &s;uccour the Op|pre&s;&s;ed, to produce the Merit of the one, and confront the Impudence of the other.</P>
<P>The Men of the greate&s;t Character in this Kind were <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal.</HI> There is not, that I remember, one ill-natured Expre&s;&s;ion in all their Writings, not one Sentence of Severity which does not apparently proceed from the contrary Di&s;po&s;ition. Whoever reads them, will, I be|lieve, be of this Mind; and if they were read with this View, it may po&s;&s;ibly per&s;wade our young Fellows, that they may be very witty Men without &s;peaking ill of any but tho&s;e who de&s;erve it: But in the Peru&s;al of the&s;e Writers it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, that they lived in very different Times. <HI>Horace</HI> was inti|mate with a Prince of the greate&s;t Goodne&s;s and Humanity imaginable, and his Court was formed after his Example: Therefore the Faults that Poet falls upon were little Incon&s;i&s;tencies in Behaviour, fal&s;e Pretences to Politene&s;s, or im|pertinent
<PB N="233" REF="243">
Affectations of what Men were not fit for. Vices of a coar&s;er Sort could not come un|der his Con&s;ideration, or enter the Palace of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus. Juvenal</HI> on the other Hand lived under <HI>Domitian,</HI> in who&s;e Reign every Thing that was great and noble was bani&s;hed the Habitations of the Men in Power. Therefore he attacks Vice as it pa&s;&s;es by in Triumph, not as it breaks into Conver&s;ation. The Fall of Empire, Contempt of Glory, and a general Degeneracy of Manners, are before his Eyes in all his Writings. In the Days of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> to have talked like <HI>Juvenal</HI> had been Madne&s;s, or in tho&s;e of <HI>Domitian</HI> like <HI>Horace.</HI> Morality and Virtue are every where re|commended in <HI>Horace,</HI> as became a Man in a po|lite Court, from the Beauty, the Propriety, the Convenience, of pur&s;uing them. Vice and Corruption are attacked by <HI>Juvenal</HI> in a Style which denotes, he fears he &s;hall not be heard without he calls to them in their own Language, with a bare-faced Mention of the Villanies and Ob&s;cenities of his Contemporaries.</P>
<P>This accidental Talk of the&s;e Two great Men runs me from my De&s;ign, which was to tell &s;ome Coxcombs that run about this Town with the Name of Smart Satyrical Fellows, that they are by no Means qualified for the Characters they pretend to, of being &s;evere upon other Men, for they want Good-Nature. There is no Founda|tion in them for arriving at what they aim at; and they may as well pretend to flatter, as rail agreeably without being Good-Natured.</P>
<P>There is a certain Impartiality nece&s;&s;ary to make what a Man &s;ays bear any Weight with tho&s;e he &s;peaks to. This Quality, with Re&s;pect to Men's Errors and Vices, is never &s;een but in Good-natured Men. They have ever &s;uch a Frankne&s;s of Mind, and Benevolence to all Men, that they cannot receive Impre&s;&s;ions of Unkind|ne&s;s without mature Deliberation; and writing
<PB N="234" REF="244">
or &s;peaking ill of a Man upon Per&s;onal Con&s;ide|ratious, is &s;o irreparable and mean an Injury, that no o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Quality is capable of do|ing it. But in all Ages there have been Interpre|ters to A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs when living, of the &s;ame Genius with the Commentators, into who&s;e Hands they fall when dead. I dare &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Man of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Wit than one of the&s;e to take any of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and twenty Letters, and form out of them a Name to de&s;cribe the Character of a Vicious Man with greater Life, but one of the&s;e would immediately cry, Mr. &s;uch a one is meant in that Place. But the Truth of it is, Sa|tyri&s;ts de&s;cribe the Age, and Backbiters a&s;&s;ign their De&s;criptions to private Men.</P>
<P>In all Terms of Reproof, when the Sentence appears to ari&s;e from Per&s;onal Hatred or Pa&s;&s;ion, it is not then made the Cau&s;e of Mankind, but a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between Two Per&s;ons. For this Rea&s;on, the Repre&s;entations of a Good-na|tured Man bear a Plea&s;antry in them, which &s;hows there is no Malignity at heart, and by Con&s;equence are attended to by his Hearers or Readers becau&s;e they are unprejudiced. This Deference is only what is due to him; for no Man thoroughly nettled can &s;ay a Thing general enough to pa&s;s off with the Air of an Opinion declared, and not a Pa&s;&s;ion gratified. I remem|ber a humorous Fellow at <HI>Oxford,</HI> when he heard any one had &s;poken ill of him, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>I won't take my Revenge on him till I have forgiven him.</HI> What he meant by this, was, that he would not enter upon this Subject till it was grown as indifferent to him as any other; and I have, by this Rule, &s;een him more than once triumph over his Adver&s;ary with an inimitable Spirit and Humour; for he came to the A&s;&s;ault again&s;t a Man full of &s;ore Places, and he him&s;elf invulnerable.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="245">
There is no Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding in a Sa|tyrical Way of Writing or Speaking, except a Man throws him&s;elf quite out of the Que&s;tion. It is great Vanity to think any one will attend a Thing becau&s;e it is your Quarrel. You mu&s;t make your Satyr the Concern of Society in ge|neral, if you would have it regarded. When it is &s;o, the Good-Nature of a Man of Wit will prompt him to many brisk and di&s;dainful Senti|ments and Replies, to which all the Malice in the World will not be able to repartee.</P>

<P>I Have &s;omewhere made Mention of <HI>Gyges</HI>'s Ring, and intimated to my Reader, that it was at pre&s;ent in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though I have not &s;ince made any U&s;e of it. The Tradition con|cerning this Ring is very Romantick, and taken Notice of both by <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Tully,</HI> who each of them make an admirable U&s;e of it for the Ad|vancement of Morality. This <HI>Gyges</HI> was the Ma|&s;ter Shepherd to King <HI>Candaules.</HI> As he was wandering over the Plains of <HI>Lydia,</HI> he &s;aw a great Cha&s;m in the Earth, and had the Curio&s;ity to enter it. After having de&s;cended pretty far into it, he found the Statue of an Hor&s;e in Bra&s;s, with Doors in the Sides of it. Upon opening of them, he found the Body of a dead Man big|ger than ordinary, with a Ring upon his Fin|ger,
<PB N="236" REF="246">
which he took off, and put it upon his own. The Virtues of it were much greater than he at fir&s;t imagined; for upon his going into the A&s;|&s;embly of Shepherds, he ob&s;erved, that he was invi&s;ible when he turned the Stone of the Ring within the Palm of his Hand, and vi&s;ible when he turned it towards his Company. Had <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicers</HI> been as well ver&s;ed in the Occult Sciences as I am, they would have found a great deal of My&s;tick Learning in this Tradition; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for an Adept to be under&s;tood by one who is not an Adept.</P>
<P>As for my &s;elf, I have with much Study and Application arrived at this great Secret of ma|king my &s;elf invi&s;ible, and by that Means con|veying my &s;elf where I plea&s;ed; or to &s;peak in Ro&s;ycrucian Lore, I have entered into the Clefts of the Earth, di&s;covered the Brazen Hor&s;e, and robbed the dead Giant of his Ring. The Tradi|tion &s;ays further of <HI>Gyges,</HI> that by the Means of this Ring he gained Admi&s;&s;ion into the mo&s;t re|tired Parts of the Court, and made &s;uch U&s;e of tho&s;e Opportunities, that he at length became King of <HI>Lydia.</HI> For my own Part, I, who have always rather endeavoured to improve my Mind than my Fortune, have turned this Ring to no other Advantage than to get a thorough In&s;ight into the Ways of Men, and to make &s;uch Ob&s;er|vations upon the Errors of others as may be u&s;e|ful to the Publick, whatever Effect they may have upon my &s;elf.</P>
<P>About a Week ago, not being able to &s;leep, I got up and put on my magical Ring, and with a Thought tran&s;ported my &s;elf into a Chamber where I &s;aw a Light. I found it inhabited by a celebrated Beauty, though &s;he is of that Species of Women whith we call a Slattern. Her Head|dre&s;s and one of her Shoes lay upon a Chair, her Petticoat in one Corner of the Room, and her Girdle that had a Copy of Ver&s;es made upon
<PB N="237" REF="247">
it but the Day before, with her Thread Stock|ings, in the middle of the Floor. I was &s;o foo|li&s;hly officious, that I could not forbear gather|ing up her Cloaths together to lay them upon the Chair that &s;tood by her Bed-&s;ide, when, to my great Surpri&s;e, after a little Muttering, &s;he cried out, <HI>What do you do? Let my Petticoat alone.</HI> I was &s;tartled at fir&s;t, but &s;oon found that &s;he was in a Dream; being one of tho&s;e who, to u&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, are <HI>&s;o loo&s;e of Thought,</HI> that they utter in their Sleep every Thing that pa&s;&s;es in their Imagination. I left the Apartment of this Female Rake, and went into her Neigh|bours, where there lay a Male-Coquet. He had a Bottle of Salts hanging over his Head, and upon the Table, by his Bed-&s;ide, <HI>Suckling</HI>'s Poems, with a little Heap of Black Patches on it. His Snuff Box was within Reach on a Chair: But while I was admiring the Di&s;po&s;ition which he made of the &s;everal Parts of his Dre&s;s, his Slumber &s;eemed interrupted by a Pang, that was accompanied by a &s;udden Oath, as he turned him&s;elf over ha&s;tily in his Bed. I did not care for &s;eeing him in his nocturnal Pains, and left the Room.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner got into another Bed-Chamber, but I heard very har&s;h Words uttered in a &s;mooth uniform Tone. I was amazed to hear &s;o great a Volubility in Reproach, and thought it too cohe|rent to be &s;poken by one a&s;leep; but upon look|ing nearer, I &s;aw the Head dre&s;s of the Per&s;on who &s;poke, which &s;hewed her to be a Female with a Man lying by her Side broad awake, and as quiet as a Lamb. I could not but admire his exemplary Patience, and di&s;covered by his whole Behaviour, that he was then lying under the Di&s;|cipline of a Curtain-Lecture.</P>
<P>I was entertained in many other Places with this Kind of Nocturnal Eloquence, but ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom I found awake, were
<PB N="238" REF="248">
kept &s;o either by Envy or by Love. Some of the&s;e were &s;ighing, and others cur&s;ing, in Soliloquy; &s;ome hugged their Pillows, and others gna&s;hed their Teeth.</P>
<P>The Covetous I likewi&s;e found to be a very wakeful People. I happened to come into a Room where one of them lay &s;ick. His Phy|&s;ician and his Wife were in clo&s;e Whi&s;per near his Bed-&s;ide. I overheard the Doctor &s;ay to the poor Gentlewoman, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly live till Five in the Morning. She received it like the Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family prepared for all Events. At the &s;ame In&s;tant came in a Servant Maid, who &s;aid, <HI>Madam, The Undertaker is below according to your Order.</HI> The Words were &s;carce out of her Mouth, when the &s;ick Man cried out with a fee|ble Voice, Pray, Doctor, how went Bank-Stock to Day at <HI>'Change?</HI> This melancholy Object made me too &s;erious for diverting my &s;elf fur|ther this Way: But as I was going Home, I &s;aw a Light in a Garret, and entering into it, heard a Voice crying, <HI>And, Hand, Stand, Band, Fann'd, Tann'd.</HI> I concluded him by this and the Furni|ture of his Room to be a Lunatick; but upon li|&s;tening a little longer, perceived it was a Poet, writing an Heroick upon the en&s;uing Peace.</P>
<P>It was now towards Morning, an Hour when Spirits, Witches, and Conjurers are obliged to re|tire to their own Apartments, and feeling the In|fluence of it, I was ha&s;tening Home, when I &s;aw a Man had got half Way into a Neighbour's Hou&s;e. I immediately called to him, and turn|ing my Ring, appeared in my proper Per&s;on. There is &s;omething Magi&s;terial in the A&s;pect of the <HI>Bicker&s;taffs,</HI> which made him run away in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I took a Turn or Two in my own Lodging, I was thinking, that, old as I was, I need not go to Bed alone, but that it was in my Power to marry the fine&s;t Lady in this Kingdom, if I
<PB N="239" REF="249">
would wed her with this Ring. For what a Figure would &s;he that &s;hould have it make a Vi&s;it, with &s;o perfect a Knowledge as this would give her of all the Scandal in the Town? But in&s;tead of en|deavouring to di&s;po&s;e of my &s;elf and it in Matri|mony, I re&s;olved to lend it to my loving Friend the Author of the <HI>Atalantis,</HI> to furni&s;h a new <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Secret Memoirs.</HI></P>

<P>IT is no ea&s;y Matter when People are advancing in any Thing, to prevent their going too fa&s;t for want of Patience. This happens in nothing more frequently than in the Pro&s;ecution of Stu|dies. Hence it is, that we meet Crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can &s;peak. They affect the Flowers of Rhetorick before they under&s;tand the Parts of Speech. In the or|dinary Conver&s;ation of this Town, there are &s;o many who can, as they call it, talk well, that there is not One in Twenty that talks to be un|der&s;tood. This proceeds from an Ambition to excel, or, as the Term is, to &s;hine, in Company. The Matter is not to make them&s;elves under|&s;tood, but admired. They come together with a certain Emulation, rather than Benevolence. When you fall among &s;uch Companions, the &s;afe Way is to give your &s;elf up, and let the Orators declaim for your E&s;teem, and trouble your &s;elf
<PB N="240" REF="250">
no further. It is &s;aid, that a Poet mu&s;t be born &s;o; but I think it may be much better &s;aid of an Orator, e&s;pecially when we talk of our Town-Poets and Orators; but the Town-Poets are full of Rules and Laws, the Town-Orators go thro' thick and thin, and are, for&s;ooth. Per&s;ons of &s;uch eminent natural Parts and Knowledge of the World, that they de&s;pi&s;e all Men as unex|perienced Schola&s;ticks who wait for an Occa&s;ion before they &s;peak, or who &s;peak no more than is nece&s;&s;ary. They had half per&s;waded me to go to the Tavern the other Night, but that a Gentle|man whi&s;pered me, Prithee, <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> go with us; there is <HI>Tom Varni&s;h</HI> will be there, and he is a Fellow that talks as well as any Man in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when a Man expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf well upon any Occa&s;ion, and his falling into an Account of any Subject ari&s;es from a De&s;ire to oblige the Company, or from Fulne&s;s of the Cir|cum&s;tance it &s;elf, &s;o that his &s;peaking of it at large is occa&s;ioned only by the Openne&s;s of a Companion; I &s;ay, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, it is not only pardonable, but agreeable when a Man takes the Di&s;cour&s;e to him&s;elf; but when you &s;ee a Fellow watch for Opportunities for being Copious, it is exce&s;&s;ively trouble&s;ome. A Man that &s;tammers, if he has Under&s;tanding, is to be attended with Patience and good Nature; but he that &s;peaks more than he need, has no Right to &s;uch an Indulgence. The Man who has a De|fect in his Speech takes Pains to come to you, while a Man of a weak Capacity with Fluency of Speech triumphs in out-running you. The Stammerer &s;trives to be fit for your Company; the loquacious Man endeavours to &s;how you, you are not fit for his.</P>
<P>With Thoughts of this Kind do I always enter into that Man's Company who is recommended as a Per&s;on that talks well; but if I were to
<PB N="241" REF="251">
chu&s;e the People with whom I would &s;pend my Hours of Conver&s;ation, they &s;hould be certain|ly &s;uch as laboured no farther than to make them&s;elves readily and clearly apprehended, and would have Patience and Curio&s;ity to under&s;tand me. To have good Sen&s;e, and Ability to expre&s;s it, are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary Qualities in Companions. When Thoughts ri&s;e in us fit to utter, among familiar Friends there needs but very little Care in cloathing them.</P>
<P><HI>Urbanus</HI> is, I take it, a Man one might live with whole Years, and enjoy all the Freedom and Improvement imaginable, and yet be in&s;en|&s;ible of a Contradiction to you in all the Mi|&s;takes you can be guilty of. His great good Will to his Friends has produced in him &s;uch a general Deference in his Di&s;cour&s;e, that if he differs from you in his Sen&s;e of any Thing, he introduces his own Thoughts by &s;ome agreeable Circumlocution, or he has often ob&s;erved &s;uch and &s;uch a Circum&s;tance that made him of ano|ther Opinion. Again, where another would be apt to &s;ay, This I am confident of, I may pretend to judge of this Matter as well as any Body; <HI>Urbanus</HI> &s;ays, I am verily per&s;waded, I believe one may conclude. In a Word, there is no Man more clear in his Thoughts and Expre&s;&s;ions than he is, or &s;peaks with greater Diffidence. You &s;hall hardly find one Man of any Con&s;ideration, but you &s;hall ob&s;erve one of le&s;s Con&s;equence form him&s;elf after him. This happens to <HI>Urba|nus;</HI> but the Man who &s;teals from him almo&s;t every Sentiment he utters in a whole Week, di&s;|gui&s;es the Theft, by carrying it with quite a dif|ferent Air. <HI>Umbratilis</HI> knows <HI>Urbanus</HI>'s doubt|ful Way of Speaking proceeds from Good-Nature and Good-Breeding, and not from Uncertainty in his Opinions. <HI>Umbratilis</HI> therefore has no more to do but repeat the Thoughts of <HI>Urbanus</HI> in a po&s;itive Manner, and appear to the Undi&s;cern|ing
<PB N="242" REF="252">
a wi&s;er Man than the Per&s;on from whom he borrows: But tho&s;e who know him, can &s;ee the Servant in his Ma&s;ter's Habit; and the more he &s;truts, the le&s;s do his Clothes appear his own.</P>
<P>In Conver&s;ation, the Medium is neither to af|fect Silence or Eloquence; not to value our Ap|probation, and to endeavour to excel us who are of your Company, are equal Inquiries. The great Enemies therefore to good Company, and tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s mo&s;t again&s;t the Laws of Equali|ty, (which is the Life of it) are, the Clown, the Wit, and the Pedant. A Clown, when he has Sen&s;e, is con&s;cious of his Want of Education, and with an aukward Bluntne&s;s hopes to keep him&s;elf in Countenance, by overthrowing the U&s;e of all polite Behaviour. He takes Advantage of the Re&s;traint good Breeding lays upon others not to offend him to tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t them, and is under the Man's own Shelter while he intrudes upon him. The Fellows of this Cla&s;s are very frequent in the Repetition of the Words, Rough and Manly. When the&s;e People happen to be by their Fortunes of the Rank of Gentlemen, they defend their other Ab&s;urdities by an imper|tinent Courage; and to help out the Defect of their Behaviour, add their being dangerous to their being di&s;agreeable. This Gentleman (though he di&s;plea&s;es, profe&s;&s;es to do &s;o, and knowing that, dares &s;till go on to do &s;o) is not &s;o painful a Companion as he who will plea&s;e you again&s;t your Will, and re&s;olves to be a Wit.</P>
<P>This Man upon all Occa&s;ions, and whoever he falls in Company with, talks in the &s;ame Circle, and in the &s;ame Round of Chat which he has learned at one of the Tables of this Coffee-hou&s;e. As Poetry is in it &s;elf an Elevation above ordinary and common Sentiments, &s;o there is no Fop is &s;o very near a Mad-man in indifferent Company as a Poetical one. He is not apprehen&s;ive that the
<PB N="243" REF="253">
Generality of the World are intent upon the Bu|&s;ine&s;s of their own Fortune and Profe&s;&s;ion, and have as little Capacity as Curio&s;ity to enter into Matters of Ornament or Speculation. I remem|ber at a full Table in the City, one of the&s;e ubi|quitary Wits was entertaining the Company with a Soliloquy (for &s;o I call it when a Man talks to tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand him) con|cerning Wit and Humour. An hone&s;t Gentle|man who &s;ate next to me, and was worth Half a Plumb, &s;tared at him, and ob&s;erving there was &s;ome Sen&s;e as he thought, mixed with his Impertinence, whi&s;pered me, <HI>Take my Word for it, this Fellow is more Knave than Fool.</HI> This was all my good Friend's Applau&s;e of the wittie&s;t Man of Talk that I was ever pre&s;ent at, which wanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>The Pedant is &s;o obvious to Ridicule, that it would be to be one to offer to explain him. He is a Gentleman &s;o well known, that there is none but tho&s;e of his own Cla&s;s who do not laugh at and avoid him. Pedantry proceeds from much Reading and little Under&s;tanding. A Pe|dant among Men of Learning and Sen&s;e, is like an ignorant Servant giving an Account of a polite Conver&s;ation. You may find he has brought with him more than could have en|tered into his Head without being there, but &s;till that he is not a Bit wi&s;er than if he had not been there at all.</P>

<P>WHen one con&s;iders the Turn which Con|ver&s;ation takes in almo&s;t every Set of Ac|quaintance, Club or A&s;&s;embly, in this Town or Kingdom, one cannot but ob&s;erve, that in &s;pight of what I am every Day &s;aying, and all the Mo|ral Writers &s;ince the Beginning of the World have &s;aid, the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e is generally upon one another's Faults. This in a great Mea&s;ure proceeds from Self-Conceit, which were to be endured in one or other individual Per&s;on; but the Folly has &s;pread it &s;elf almo&s;t over all the Species; and one cannot only &s;ay, <HI>Tom, Jack,</HI> or <HI>Will,</HI> but in general, <HI>That Man is a Coxcomb.</HI> From this Source it is, that any Excellence is faintly received, any Imperfection unmercifully expo&s;ed. But if Things were put in a true Light, and we would take Time to con&s;ider that Man in his very Nature is an imperfect Being, our Sen&s;e of this Matter would be immediately altered, and the Word <HI>Imperfection</HI> would not carry an unhinder Idea than the Word <HI>Humanity.</HI> It is a plea&s;ant Story, that we, for&s;ooth, who are the only imperfect Creatures in the Univer&s;e, are the only Beings that will not allow of Imperfection. Some Body has taken Notice, that we &s;tand in the Middle of Exi&s;tencies, and are by this one Circum&s;tance the mo&s;t unhappy of all others. The Brutes are guided by In&s;tinct, and know no
<PB N="249" REF="259">
Sorrow; the Angels have Knowledge, and they are happy; but Men are govern'd by Opinion, which is I know not what Mixture of In&s;tinct and Knowledge, and are neither indolent nor happy. It is very ob&s;ervable, that Criticks are a People between the Learned and the Ignorant, and by that Situation enjoy the Tranquility of neither. As Criticks &s;tand among Men, &s;o do Men in ge|neral between Brutes and Angels. Thus every Man as he is a Critick and a Coxcomb, till im|proved by Rea&s;on and Speculation, is ever for|getting him&s;elf, and laying open the Faults of others.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time that I am talking of the Cruelty of urging People's Faults with Severity, I cannot but bewail &s;ome which Men are guilty of for want of Admonition. The&s;e are &s;uch as they can ea&s;ily mend, and no Body tells them of; for which Rea&s;on I &s;hall make U&s;e of the Penny-Po&s;t, (as I have with Succe&s;s to &s;everal young Ladies about turning their Eyes, and holding up their Heads) to certain Gentlemen whom I remark ha|bitually guilty of what they may reform in a Moment. There is a fat Fellow whom I have long remarked wearing his Brea&s;t open in the Mid&s;t of Winter, out of an Affectation of Youth. I have therefore &s;ent him ju&s;t now the following Letter in my Phy&s;ical Capacity.</P>

<P>The&s;e little Intimations do great Service, and are very u&s;eful, not only to the Per&s;ons them|&s;elves, but to inform others how to conduct them|&s;elves towards them.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of this hone&s;t private Method, or a Friendly one Face to Face, of acquainting People with Things in their Power to explain or amend, the u&s;ual Way among People is to take no No|tice of Things you can help, and neverthele&s;s expo&s;s you for tho&s;e you cannot.</P>
<P><HI>Plumbeus</HI> and <HI>Levis</HI> are con&s;tantly in each others Company: They would, if they took pro|per Methods, be very agreeable Companions; but they &s;o extravagantly aim at what they are unfit for, and each of them rallies the other &s;o much in the wrong Place, that in&s;tead of doing each other the Offices of Friends, they do but in|&s;truct the re&s;t of the World to laugh at them with more Knowledge and Skill. <HI>Plumbeus</HI> is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;aturnine and &s;ullen Complexion; <HI>Levis,</HI> of a mercurial and airy Di&s;po&s;ition.

would in a fews Years know the Forms of Orders &s;o well, as to direct and dictate with &s;o much Ea&s;e, as to be thought a &s;olid, able, and at the &s;ame Time, a &s;ure Man of Di&s;patch. <HI>Levis,</HI> with a little Reading and coming more into Company, would &s;oon be able to write a Song, or lead up a Country-Dance. In&s;tead of the&s;e proper Pur|&s;uits, in Obedience to their re&s;pective Genius's, <HI>Plumbeus</HI> endeavours to be the Man of Plea&s;ure, and <HI>Levis</HI> the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s. This appears in their Speech, and in their Dre&s;s: <HI>Plumbeus</HI> is ever egregiou&s;ly fine, and talking &s;omething like Wit; <HI>Levis</HI> is ever extremely grave, and with a &s;illy Face repeating Maxims. The&s;e Two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable of, the one to be wi&s;e, and the other gay; but are ex|tremely critical in their Judgments of each other in their Way towards what they pretend to, <HI>Plumbeus</HI> acknowledges <HI>Levis</HI> a Man of a great Reach, becau&s;e it is what <HI>Plumbeus</HI> never cared for being thought him&s;elf, and <HI>Levis</HI> allows <HI>Plumbeus</HI> to be an agreeable Rake for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. Now were the&s;e dear Friends to be free with each other as they ought to be, they would change Characters, and be both as commendable, in&s;tead of being as ridiculous, as their Capacities will admit of.</P>
<P>Were it not too grave, all that I would urge on this Subject is, that Men are bewildered when they con&s;ider them&s;elves in any other View than that of Strangers, who are in a Place where it is no great Matter whether they can, or unrea&s;ona|ble to expect they &s;hould, have every Thing about them as well as at their own Home. This Way of Thinking is, perhaps, the only one that can put this Being into a proper Po&s;ture for the Ea&s;e of Society. It is certain, this would reduce all Faults into tho&s;e which proceed from Malice or Di&s;hone&s;ty: It would quite change our Manner of beholding one another, and nothing that was
<PB N="252" REF="262">
not below a Man's Nature would be below his Character. The Arts of this Life would be pro|per Advances towards the next; and a very good Man would be a very fine Gentleman. As it now is, Humane Life is inverted, and we have not learned half the Knowledge of this World before we are dropping into another. Thus, in&s;tead of the Raptures and Contemplations which natural|ly attend a well-&s;pent Life from the Approach of Eternity, even we old Fellows are afraid of the Ridicule of tho&s;e who are born &s;ince us, and a&s;hamed not to under&s;tand, as well as peevi&s;h to re&s;ign, the Mode, the Fa&s;hion, the Ladies, the Fiddles, the Balls, and what not. <HI>Dick Reptile,</HI> who does not want Humour, is very plea&s;ant at our Club when he &s;ees an old Fellow touchy at being laughed at for any Thing that is not in the Mode, and bawls in his Ear, <HI>Prithee don't mind him; tell him thou art mortal.</HI></P>

<P>I Pre&s;ume to lay before you an Affair of mine, and begs you'le be very &s;inceir in giving me your Judgment and Advice in this Matter, which is as followes:</P>
<P>A very agreeable young Gentleman, who is endowed with all the good Quallities that can make a Man compleat, has this long Time maid Love to me in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionat Manner that was po&s;able. He has left nothing un&s;aid to make me belive his Affections real; and in his Letters expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o han&s;omly, and &s;o tenderly, that I had all the Rea&s;on imaginable to belive him &s;inceir. In &s;hort, he po&s;itively has promi&s;ed me he would marry me: But I find all he &s;aid nothing; for when the Que&s;tion was put to him, he wouldn't; but &s;till would con|tinue my Humble Servant, and would go on at the ould Rate, repeating the A&s;&s;urences of his Fidelity (and at the &s;ame Time has none in him). He now writs to me in the &s;ame endear|ing Style he u&s;t to do, would have me &s;pake to no Man but him&s;elf. His E&s;tate is in his oune Hand, his Father being dead.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have frequently read over your Letter, and am of Opinion, that as lamentable as it is, it is the mo&s;t common of any Evil that attends our Sex. I am very much troubled for the Ten|derne&s;s you expre&s;s towards your Lover, but rejoice at the &s;ame Time that you can &s;o far &s;urmount your Inclination for him as to re&s;olve to di&s;mi&s;s him when you have my Brother's Opinion for it. His Sen&s;e of the Matter, he de|&s;ired me to communicate to you. Oh <HI>Almei|ra!</HI> The common Failing of our Sex is to value the Merit of our Lovers rather from the Grace of their Addre&s;s, than the Sincerity of their Hearts. <HI>He has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o hand&s;omely!</HI> Can you &s;ay, that after you have Rea&s;on to doubt his Truth? It is a very melancholy Thing, that in this Circum&s;tance of Love (which is the mo&s;t important of all others in Female Life) we Women, who are, they &s;ay, always weak, are &s;till weake&s;t. The true Way of va|luing a Man, is to con&s;ider his Reputation among the Men: For Want of this nece&s;&s;ary Rule towards her Conduct, when it is too late, we find our &s;elves married to the Outca&s;ts of that Sex; and it is generally from being di&s;|agreeable among Men, that Fellows endeavour to make them&s;elves plea&s;ing to us. The little Accompli&s;hments of coming into a Room with a good Air, and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear among our &s;elves, u&s;ually make up the whole of a Woman's Man's Merit. But if we, when we began to reflect upon our Lover, in the fir&s;t Place con&s;idered what Figures they make in the Camp, at the Bar, on the <HI>'Change,</HI> in their Country, or at Court, we &s;hould
<PB N="255" REF="265">
behold them in quite another View than at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Were we to behave our &s;elves according to this Rule, we &s;hould not have the ju&s;t Imputa|tion of favouring the &s;illie&s;t of Mortals, to the great Scandal of the wi&s;e&s;t, who value our Fa|vour as it advances their Plea&s;ure, not their Reputation. In a Word, Madam, if you would judge aright in Love, you mu&s;t look upon it as in a Ca&s;e of Friend&s;hip. Were this Gentleman treating with you for any Thing but your &s;elf, when you had con&s;ented to his Offer, if he fell off, you would call him a Cheat and an Impo&s;tor. There is therefore nothing left for you to do, but to de&s;pi&s;e him and your &s;elf for doing with Re|gret.</P>

<P>I have heard it often argued in Conver&s;ation, that this Evil Practice is owing to the perverted Ta&s;t of the Wits in the la&s;t Generation. A Li|bertine on the Throne could very ea&s;ily make the Language and the Fa&s;hion turn his own Way. Hence it is, that Woman is treated as a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and not a Wife. It is from the Writings of tho&s;e Times, and the traditional Accounts of the De|bauches of their Men of Plea&s;ure, that the Cox|combs now-a-days take upon them, for&s;ooth, to be fal&s;e Swains and perjured Lovers. Methinks I feel all the Woman ri&s;e in me, when I reflect upon the nau&s;eous Rogues that pretend to deceive us. Wretches, that can never have it in their Power to over-reach any Thing living but their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es! In the Name of Goodne&s;s, if we are de&s;igned by Nature as &s;uitable Companions to the other Sex, Why are we not treated accordingly? If we have Merit, as &s;ome allow, Why is it not as ba&s;e in Men to injure us as one another? If we are the In&s;ignificants that others call us, Where is
<PB N="256" REF="266">
the Triumph in deceiving us? But when I look at the Bottom of this Di&s;a&s;ter, and recollect the many of my Acquaintance whom I have known in the &s;ame Condition with the <HI>Northern La&s;s</HI> that occa&s;ions this Di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t own I have ever found the Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of Men has been ge|nerally owing to our&s;elves, and we have contri|buted to our own Deceit. The Truth is, we do not conduct our &s;elves as we are courted, but as we are inclined. When we let our Imaginations take this unbridled Swing, it is not he that acts be&s;t is mo&s;t lovely, but he that is mo&s;t lovely acts be&s;t. When our humble Servants make their Ad|dre&s;&s;es, we do not keep our &s;elves enough di&s;inga|ged to be Judges of their Merit; and we &s;eldom give our Judgment of our Lover, till we have lo&s;t our Judgment of him.</P>
<P>While <HI>Clarinda</HI> was pa&s;&s;ionately attended and addre&s;&s;ed to by <HI>Strephon,</HI> who is a Man of Sen&s;e and Knowledge in the World; and <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> who has a plentiful Fortune and an excellent Under&s;tand|ing, &s;he fell in Love with <HI>Damon</HI> at a Ball: From that Moment &s;he that was before the mo&s;t rea|&s;onable Creature of all my Acquaintance, cannot hear <HI>Strephon</HI> &s;peak, but it is &s;omething &s;o out <HI>of the Way of Ladies Conver&s;ation:</HI> And <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> has ne|ver &s;ince opened his Mouth before us, but &s;he whi&s;pers me, <HI>How &s;eldom do Riches and Sen&s;e go together?</HI> The I&s;&s;ue of all this is, that for the Love of <HI>Damon,</HI> who has neither Experience, Under&s;tanding, or Wealth, &s;he de&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e Ad|vantages in the other Two which &s;he finds want|ing in her Lover; or el&s;e thinks he has them for no Rea&s;on but becau&s;e he is her Lover. This and many other In&s;tances may be given in this Town; but I hope thus much may &s;uffice to prevent the Growth of &s;uch Evils at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>

<P>IT may perhaps appear ridiculous; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this la&s;t Summer as I was riding in <HI>Enfield Cha&s;e,</HI> I met a young Lady whom I could hardly get out of my Head, and for ought I know my Heart, ever &s;ince. She was mounted on a Pad, with a very well-fancied Furniture. She &s;ate her Hor&s;e with a very graceful Air; and when I &s;aluted her with my Hat, &s;he bowed to me &s;o obligingly, that whether it was her Civility or Beauty that touched me &s;o much, I know not, but I am &s;ure I &s;hall never forget her. She dwells in my Imagination in a Figure &s;o much to her Advantage, that if I were to draw a Picture of Youth, Health, Beauty, or Mode&s;ty, I &s;hould re|pre&s;ent any or all of them in the Per&s;on of that young Woman.</P>
<P>I do not find that there are any De&s;criptions in the ancient Poets &s;o beautiful as tho&s;e they draw of Nymphs in their Pa&s;toral Dre&s;&s;es and Exerci&s;es. <HI>Virgil</HI> gives <HI>Venus</HI> the Habit of a <HI>Spartan</HI> Hun|tre&s;s when &s;he is to put <HI>Aeneas</HI> in his Way, and relieve his Cares with the mo&s;t agreeable Object imaginable. <HI>Diana</HI> and her Train are always de&s;cribed as Inhabitants of the Woods, and Fol|lowers of the Cha&s;e. To be well diverted, is the &s;afe&s;t Guard to Innocence; and, methinks, it
<PB N="258" REF="268">
&s;hould be one of the fir&s;t Things to be regarded among People of Condition to find out proper Amu&s;ements for young Ladies. I cannot but think this of Riding might ea&s;ily be revived a|mong them, when they con&s;ider how much it mu&s;t contribute to their Beauty. This would lay up the be&s;t Portion they could bring into a Fami|ly, a good Stock of Health, to tran&s;mit to their Po&s;terity. Such a charming Bloom as this gives the Countenance, is very much preferable to the real or affected Feeblene&s;s or Softne&s;s, which ap|pear in the Faces of our modern Beauties.</P>
<P>The Comedy, called, <HI>The Ladies Cure,</HI> repre|&s;ents the Affectation of wan Looks and languid Glances to a very entertaining Extravagance. There is, as the Lady in the Play complains, &s;omething &s;o robu&s;t in perfect Health, that it is with her a Point of Breeding and Delicacy to ap|pear in publick with a &s;ickly Air. But the natu|ral Gaiety and Spirit which &s;hine in the Com|plexion of &s;uch as form to them&s;elves a Sort of diverting Indu&s;try by chu&s;ing Recreations that are Exerci&s;es, &s;urpa&s;s all the fal&s;e Ornaments and Graces that can be put on by applying the whole Di&s;pen&s;ary of a Toilet. An healthy Body and a chearful Mind give Charms as irre&s;i&s;tible as ini|mitable. The Beauteous <HI>Dictynna,</HI> who came to Town la&s;t Week, has from the con&s;tant Pro&s;pect in a delicious Country, and the moderate Exer|ci&s;e and Journeys in the Vi&s;its &s;he made round it, contracted a certain Life in her Countenance which will in vain employ both the Painters and Poets to repre&s;ent. The becoming Negligence in her Dre&s;s, the &s;evere Sweetne&s;s of her Looks, and a certain innocent Boldne&s;s in all her Behaviour, are the Effect of the active Recreations I am talk|ing of.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of &s;uch or any other as innocent and plea&s;ing Method of pa&s;&s;ing away their Time with Alacrity, we have many in Town who
<PB N="259" REF="269">
&s;pend their Hours in an indolent State of Body and Mind, without either Recreations or Re|flections. I am apt to believe, there are &s;ome Pa|rents imagine their Daughters will be accompli&s;h|ed enough, if nothing interrupts their Growth or their Shape. According to this Method of Education, I could name you Twenty Families, where all the Girls hear of in this Life is, That it is Time to ri&s;e and to come to Dinner; as if they were &s;o in&s;ignificant as to be wholly pro|vided for when they are fed and cloathed.</P>
<P>It is with great Indignation that I &s;ee &s;uch Crowds of the Female World lo&s;t to humane So|ciety, and condemned to a Lazine&s;s, which makes Life pa&s;s away with le&s;s Reli&s;h than in the hard|e&s;t Labour. <HI>Pale&s;tris</HI> in her Drawing-Room, is &s;upported by Spirits to keep off the Returns of Spleen and Melancholy, before &s;he can get over half the Day for want of &s;omething to do, while the Wench in the Kitchen &s;ings and &s;cowrs from Morning to Night.</P>
<P>The next di&s;agreeable Thing to a lazy Lady, is a very bu&s;y one. A Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s in good Company, who gives an Account of his Abilities and Di&s;patches, is hardly more in&s;upportable than her they call a Notable Woman, and a Ma|nager. Lady <HI>Goodday,</HI> where I vi&s;ited the other Day at a very polite Circle, entertained a great Lady with a <HI>Recipe</HI> for a Poultice, and gave us to under&s;tand, that &s;he had done extraordinary Cures &s;ince &s;he was la&s;t in Town. It &s;eems a Countryman had wounded him&s;elf with his Sithe as he was Mowing; and we were obliged to hear of her Charity, her Medicine, and her Humility, in the har&s;he&s;t Tone, and cour&s;e&s;t Language ima|ginable.</P>
<P>What I would reque&s;t in all this Prattle is, that our Females would either let us have their Per|&s;ons or their Minds in &s;uch Perfection as Nature de&s;igned them.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="270">
The Way to this is, that tho&s;e who are in the Quality of Gentlewomen &s;hould propo&s;e to them|&s;elves &s;ome &s;uitable Method of pa&s;&s;ing away their Time. This would furni&s;h them with Reflections and Sentiments proper for the Companions of rea&s;onable Men, and prevent the unnatural Mar|riages which happen every Day between the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Women, and the verie&s;t Oafs; the worthie&s;t Men, and the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Females. Were the general Turn of Womens Education of another Kind than it is at pre&s;ent, we &s;hould want one another for more Rea&s;ons than we do as the World now goes. The common De&s;ign of Pa|rents is to get their Girls off as well as they can, and make no Con&s;cience of putting into our Hands a Bargain for our whole Life, which will make our Hearts ake every Day of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore take this Matter into &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and will propo&s;e, for the better Improvement of the Fair Sex, a <HI>Female Library.</HI> This Collection of Books &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch Authors as do not corrupt while they divert, but &s;hall tend more immediately to improve them, as they are Women. They &s;hall be &s;uch as &s;hall not hurt a Feature by the Au&s;terity of their Reflections, nor cau&s;e one impertinent Glance by the Wanton|ne&s;s of them. They &s;hall all tend to advance the Value of their Innocence as Virgins, improve their Under&s;tanding as Wives, and regulate their Ten|derne&s;s as Parents. It has been very often &s;aid in the&s;e Lucubrations, that the Ideas which mo&s;t frequently pa&s;s through our Imaginations, leave Traces of them&s;elves in our Countenances. There &s;hall be a &s;trict Regard had to this in my Female Library, which &s;hall be furni&s;hed with nothing that &s;hall give Supplies to O&s;tentation or Imper|tinence, but the whole &s;hall be &s;o dige&s;ted for the U&s;e of my Students, that they &s;hall not go out of Character in their Enquiries, but their Knowledge appear only a cultivated Innocence.</P>

<P>I Was la&s;t Night vi&s;ited by a Friend of mine who has an inexhau&s;tible Fund of Di&s;cour&s;e, and never fails to entertain his Company with a Variety of Thoughts and Hints that are altogether new and uncommon. Whether it were in Com|plai&s;ance to my Way of Living, or his real Opi|nion, he advanced the following Paradox, That it required much greater Talents to fill up and become a retired Life, than a Life of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Upon this Occa&s;ion he rallied very agreeably the bu&s;ie Men of the Age, who only valued them|&s;elves of being in Motion, and pa&s;&s;ing through a Series of trifling and in&s;ignificant Actions. In the Heat of his Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;eeing a Piece of Money lying on my Table, I defie (&s;ays he) any of the&s;e active Per&s;ons to produce half the Adventures that this Twelvepenny-Piece has been engaged in, were it po&s;&s;ible for him to give us an Account of his Life.</P>
<P>My Friend's Talk made &s;o odd an Impre&s;&s;ion upon my Mind, that &s;oon after I was a-Bed I fell in&s;en&s;ibly into a mo&s;t unaccountable <HI>Re&s;verie,</HI> that had neither Moral nor De&s;ign in it, and can|not be &s;o properly called a Dream as a Delirium.</P>
<P>Methoughts the Shilling that lay upon the Ta|ble reared it &s;elf upon its Edge, and turning the Face towards me, opened its Mouth, and in a &s;oft
<PB N="262" REF="272">
Silver Sound gave me the following Account of his Life and Adventures:</P>
<P>I was born, &s;ays he, on the Side of a Mountain, near a little Village of <HI>Peru,</HI> and made a Voyage to <HI>England</HI> in an Ingot, under the Convoy of Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI> I was, &s;oon after my Arri|val, taken out of my <HI>Indian</HI> Habit, refined, na|turalized, and put into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mode, with the Face of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> on one Side, and the Arms of the Country on the other. Being thus equipped, I found in me a wonderful Inclination to ramble, and vi&s;it all the Parts of the new World into which I was brought. The People very much favoured my natural Di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;hifted me &s;o fa&s;t from Hand to Hand, that before I was Five Years old, I had travelled into almo&s;t every Corner of the Nation. But in the Begin|ning of my Sixth Year, to my un&s;peakable Grief, I fell into the Hands of a mi&s;erable old Fellow, who clapped me into an Iron Che&s;t, where I found Five Hundred more of my own Quality who lay under the &s;ame Confinement. The only Relief we had, was to be taken out and counted over in the fre&s;h Air every Morning and Evening. After an Impri&s;onment of &s;everal Years, we heard &s;ome Body knocking at our Che&s;t, and breaking it open with an Hammer. This we found was the old Man's Heir, who, as his Father lay a dy|ing, was &s;o good as to come to our Relea&s;e: He &s;eparated us that very Day. What was the Fate of my Companions, I know not: As for my &s;elf, I was &s;ent to the Apothecary's Shop for a Pint of Sack. The Apothecary gave me to an Herb-Wo|man, the Herb-Woman to a Butcher, the Butcher to a Brewer, and the Brewer to his Wife, who made a Pre&s;ent of me to a Nonconformi&s;t Prea|cher. After this Manner I made my Way merri|ly through the World; for, as I told you before, we Shillings love nothing &s;o much as travelling. I &s;ometimes fetched in a Shoulder of Mutton
<PB N="263" REF="273">
&s;ometimes a Play-Book, and often had the Sati&s;|faction to treat a Templer at a Twelvepenny Or|dinary, or carry him with Three Friends to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t of this plea&s;ant Progre&s;s which I made from Place to Place, I was arre&s;ted by a &s;u|per&s;titious old Woman, who &s;hut me up in a greazy Pur&s;e, in Pur&s;uance of a fooli&s;h Saying, That while &s;he kept a Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Shilling about her, &s;he &s;hould never be without Money. I continued here a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner for many Months, till at la&s;t I was exchanged for Eight and Forty Farthings.</P>
<P>I thus rambled from Pocket to Pocket till the Beginning of the Civil Wars, when (to my Shame be it &s;poken) I was employed in rai&s;ing Soldiers again&s;t the King: For being of a very tempting Breadth, a Serjeant made U&s;e of me to inveigle Country Fellows, and li&s;t them in the Service of the Parliament.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had made one Man &s;ure, his Way was to oblige him to take a Shilling of a more homely Figure, and then practi&s;e the &s;ame Trick upon another. Thus I continued doing great Mi&s;chief to the Crown, till my Officer chancing one Morning to walk Abroad earlier than ordina|ry, &s;acrificed me to his Plea&s;ures, and made U&s;e of me to &s;educe a Milk-Maid. This Wench bent me, and gave me to her Sweetheart, applying more properly than &s;he intended the u&s;ual Form of, <HI>To my Love and from my Love.</HI> This unge|nerous Gallant marrying her within few Days after, pawned me for a Dram of Brandy, and drinking me out next Day, I was beaten flat with an Hammer, and again &s;et a running.</P>
<P>After many Adventures, which it would be te|dious to relate, I was &s;ent to a young Spendthrift, in Company with the Will of his decea&s;ed Fa|ther. The young Fellow, who I found was very extravagant, gave great Demon&s;trations of Joy at
<PB N="264" REF="274">
the Receiving the Will; but opening it, he found him&s;elf di&s;inherited and cut off from the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a fair E&s;tate, by Vertue of my being made a Pre&s;ent to him. This put him into &s;uch a Pa&s;|&s;ion, that after having taken me in his Hand, and cur&s;ed me, he &s;quirred me away from him as far as he could fling me. I chanced to light in an unfrequented Place under a dead Wall, where I lay undi&s;covered and u&s;ele&s;s, during the U&s;urpa|tion of <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI></P>
<P>About a Year after the King's Return, a poor Cavalier that was walking there about Dinner|time fortunately ca&s;t his Eye upon me, and, to the great Joy of us both, carried me to a Cook's-Shop, where he dined upon me, and drank the King's Health. When I came again into the World, I found that I had been happier in my Retirement than I thought, having probably by that Means e&s;caped wearing a mon&s;trous Pair of Breeches.</P>
<P>Being now of great Credit and Antiquity, I was rather looked upon as a Medal than an ordi|nary Coin; for which Rea&s;on a Game&s;ter laid hold of me, and converted me into a Counter, ha|ving got together &s;ome Dozens of us for that U&s;e. We led a melancholy Life in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being bu&s;y at tho&s;e Hours wherein Current Coin is at re&s;t, and partaking the Fate of our Ma&s;ter, being in a few Moments valued at a Crown, a Pound, or a Sixpence, according to the Situation in which the Fortune of the Cards placed us. I had at length the good Luck to &s;ee my Ma&s;ter break, by which Means I was again &s;ent Abroad under my primitive Denomination of a Shil|ling.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over many other Accidents of le&s;s Moment, and ha&s;ten to that fatal Cata&s;trophe when I fell into the Hands of an Arti&s;t who con|veyed me under Ground, and with an unmerciful Pair of Sheers cut off my Titles, clipped my
<PB N="265" REF="275">
Brims, retrenched my Shape, rubbed me to my inmo&s;t Ring, and, in &s;hort, &s;o &s;poiled and pillaged me, that he did not leave me worth a Groat. You may think what a Confu&s;ion I was in to &s;ee my &s;elf thus curtailed and disfigured. I &s;hould have been a&s;hamed to have &s;hown my Head, had not all my old Acquaintance been reduced to the &s;ame &s;hameful Figure, excepting &s;ome few that were punched through the Belly. In the mid&s;t of this general Calamity, when every Body thought our Misfortune irretrievable, and our Ca&s;e de&s;perate, we were thrown into the Furnace together, and (as it often happens with Cities ri|&s;ing out of a Fire) appeared with greater Beauty and Lu&s;tre than we could ever boa&s;t of before. What has happened to me &s;ince this Change of Sex which you now &s;ee, I &s;hall take &s;ome other Opportunity to relate. In the mean Time I &s;hall only repeat Two Adventures, as being very ex|traordinary, and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my Life. The Fir&s;t was, my being in a Poet's Pocket, who was &s;o taken with the Brightne&s;s and Novelty of my Appearance, that it gave Occa&s;ion to the fine&s;t Burle&s;que Poem in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Language, entitu|ed from me, <HI>The Splendid Shilling.</HI> The Second Adventure, which I mu&s;t not omit, happened to me in the Year 1703, when I was given away in Charity to a blind Man; but indeed this was by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mi&s;take, the Per&s;on who gave me having heed|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ly thrown me into the Hat among a Penny|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">orth of Farthings.</P>

That of the Petticoat gave al&s;o a general Satisfaction, not to mention the more important Points of the Cane and Per&s;pective; in which, if I did not give Judgments and Decrees according to the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of Equity and Ju&s;tice, I can &s;afely &s;ay, I acted according to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding. But as for the Proceedings of that Court, I &s;hall refer my Reader to an Ac|count of them, written by my Secretary, which is now in the Pre&s;s, and will &s;hortly be publi&s;hed under the Title of <HI>Lillie</HI>'s <HI>Reports.</HI></P>
<P>As I la&s;t Year pre&s;ided over a Court of Ju&s;tice, it is my intention this Year to &s;et my &s;elf at the Head of a Court of Honour. There is no Court o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Nature any where at pre&s;ent, except in <HI>France,</HI> where, according to the be&s;t of my in|telligence, it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch only as are Mar&s;hals of that Kingdom. I am likewi&s;e informed, that there is not one of that honourable Board at pre|&s;ent who has not been driven out of the Field by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> But whether this be only an accidental or a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not able to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277">
As for the Court of Honour of which I am here &s;peaking, I intend to &s;it my &s;elf in it as Pre|&s;ident, with &s;everal Men of Honour on my Right Hand, and Women of Virtue on my Left, as my A&s;&s;i&s;tants. The Fir&s;t Place of the Bench I have given to an old <HI>Tangereen</HI> Captain with a Wooden Leg. The Second is a Gentleman of a long twi&s;ted Periwig without a Curl in it, a Muff with very little Hair upon it, and a Thread-bare Coat with new Buttons, being a Per&s;on of great Worth, and Second Brother to a Man of Quali|ty. The Third is a Gentleman-U&s;her, extreamly well read in Romances, and Grand&s;on to one of the greate&s;t Wits in <HI>Germany,</HI> who was &s;ome Time Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies to the Duke of <HI>Wolfembuttel.</HI></P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who &s;it further on my Right Hand, as it is u&s;ual in publick Courts, they are &s;uch as will fill up the Number of Faces up|on the Bench, and &s;erve rather for Ornament than U&s;e.</P>
<P>The chief upon my Left Hand are, an old Mai|den Lady, that pre&s;erves &s;ome of the be&s;t Blood of <HI>England</HI> in her Veins.</P>
<P>A <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Woman of a little Stature, but high Spirit.</P>
<P>An old Prude that has cen&s;ured every Marriage for the&s;e Thirty Years, and is lately wedded to a young Rake.</P>
<P>Having thus furni&s;hed my Bench, I &s;hall e&s;ta|bli&s;h Corre&s;pondencies with the Hor&s;e-Guards, and the Veterans of <HI>Chel&s;ea College;</HI> the former to furni&s;h me with Twelve Men of Honour as often as I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion for a Grand Jury, and the latter with as many good Men and true for a Petty Jury.</P>
<P>As for the Women of Virtue, it will not be difficult for me to find them about Midnight at Crimp and Ba&s;&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="278">
Having given this publick Notice of my Court, I mu&s;t further add, that I intend to open it on this Day Sevennight, being <HI>Monday</HI> the Twen|tieth In&s;tant; and do hereby invite all &s;uch as have &s;uffered Injuries and A&s;tronts, that are not to be redre&s;&s;ed by the common Laws of this Land, whether they be &s;hort Bows, cold Saluta|tions, &s;upercilious Looks, unreturned Smiles, di|&s;tant Behaviour, or forced Familiarity; as al&s;o all &s;uch as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous Expre&s;&s;ion, accidental Ju&s;tle, or unkind Repartee; likewi&s;e all &s;uch as have been defrauded of their Right to the Wall, tricked out of the upper End of the Table, or have been &s;uffered to place them|&s;elves in their own Wrong on the Back-Seat of the Coach: The&s;e, and all of the&s;e, I do, as I above &s;aid, invite to bring in their &s;everal Ca&s;es and Complaints, in which they &s;hall be relieved with all imaginable Expedition.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the Office I have now taken upon me will engage me in the Di&s;qui&s;i|tion of many weighty Points that daily perplex the Youth of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and therefore I have already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;everal of them for my fu|ture U&s;e; as, How far a Man may brandi&s;h his Cane in the telling a Story, without in&s;ulting his Hearer? What Degree of Contradiction amounts to the Lye? How a Man &s;hould re&s;ent another's &s;taring and cocking a Hat in his Face? If asking Pardon is an Attonement for treading upon ones Toes? Whether a Man may put up a Box on the Ear received from a Stranger in the Dark? Or, Whether a Man of Honour may take a Blow of his Wife? With &s;everal other Subtilties of the like Nature.</P>
<P>For my Direction in the Duties of my Office, I have furni&s;hed my &s;elf with a certain A&s;trologi|cal Pair of Scales which I have contrived for this Purpo&s;e. In one of them I lay the Injuries, in the other the Reparations. The fir&s;t are repre|&s;ented
<PB N="269" REF="279">
by little Weights made of a Metal re&s;em|bling Iron, and the other in Gold. The&s;e are not only lighter than the Weights made u&s;e of in Averdupois, but al&s;o than &s;uch as are u&s;ed in Troy-Weight. The heavie&s;t of tho&s;e that repre|&s;ent the Injuries amount but to a Scruple; and decrea&s;e by &s;o many Sub-divi&s;ions, that there are &s;everal imperceptible Weights which cannot be &s;een without the Help of a very fine Micro&s;cope. I might acquaint my Reader, that the&s;e Scales were made under the Influence of the Sun when he was in <HI>Libra,</HI> and de&s;cribe many Signatures on the Weights both of Injury and Reparation: But as this would look rather to proceed from an O&s;tentation of my own Art than any Care for the Publick, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over in Silence.</P>

<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to an ea&s;y and happy Life, to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Minds in &s;uch a Manner as to be always well &s;atisfied with our own Reflections.
<PB N="270" REF="280">
The Way to this State, is to mea&s;ure our Actions by our own Opinion, and not by that of the re&s;t of the World. The Sen&s;e of other Men ought to prevail over us in Things of le&s;s Con&s;ideration, but not in Concerns where Truth and Honour are engaged. When we look into the Bottom of Things, what at fir&s;t appears a Paradox, is a plain Truth; and tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions which, for Want of being duly weighed, &s;eem to proceed from a Sort of Romantick Philo&s;ophy, and Ignorance of the World, after a little Reflection are &s;o rea&s;onable, that it is direct Madne&s;s to walk by any other Rules. Thus to contradict our De&s;ires, and to conquer the Impul&s;es of our Ambition, if they do not fall in with what we in our inward Senti|ments approve, is &s;o much our Intere&s;t, and &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our real Happine&s;s, that to contemn all the Wealth and Power in the World, where they &s;tand in Competition with a Man's Honour, is rather good Sen&s;e than Greatne&s;s of Mind.</P>
<P>Did we con&s;ider that the Mind of a Man is the Man him&s;elf, we &s;hould think it the mo&s;t unna|tural Sort of Self-Murther to &s;acrifice the Senti|ment of the Soul to gratify the Appetites of the Body. Ble&s;s us! Is it po&s;&s;ible, that when the Nece&s;&s;ities of Life are &s;upplied, a Man would flatter to be rich, or circumvent to be powerful? When we meet a poor Wretch urged with Hun|ger and Cold asking an Alms, we are apt to think this a State we could rather &s;tarve than &s;ubmit to: But yet how much more de&s;picable is his Condition who is above Nece&s;&s;ity, and yet &s;hall re&s;ign his Rea&s;on and his Integrity to purcha&s;e Superfluities? The&s;e are both abject and common Beggars; but &s;ure it is le&s;s de&s;picable to beg a Supply to a Man's Hunger than his Vanity. But Cu&s;tom and general Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have &s;o far prevailed over an unthinking World, that tho&s;e nece&s;&s;itous Creatures who cannot reli&s;h Life
<PB N="271" REF="281">
without Applau&s;e, Attendance, and Equipage, are &s;o far from making a contemptible Figure, that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Virtue is le&s;s e&s;teemed than &s;uc|ce&s;sful Vice. But if a Man's Appeal in Ca&s;es that regarded his Honour were made to his own Soul, there would be a Bafis and &s;tanding Rule for our Conduct, and we &s;hould always endeavour ra|ther to be than appear honourable. Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> in his E&s;&s;ay on <HI>Fortitude,</HI> has treated this Subject with great Wit and Magnanimity. <HI>What</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>can be more honourable than to have Courage enough to execute the Commands of Rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience; to maintain the Dignity of our Nature, and the Station a&s;&s;igned us? To be Proof again&s;t Poverty, Pain, and Death it &s;elf? I mean &s;o far as not to do any Thing that's &s;candalous or &s;inful to avoid them? To &s;tand Adver&s;ity under all Shapes with Decency and Re&s;olution? To do this, is to be great above Title and Fortune. This argues the Soul of an Heavenly Extraction, and is worthy the Offspring of the Deity.</HI></P>
<P>What a generous Ambition has this Man point|ed to us? When Men have &s;ettled in them&s;elves a Conviction by &s;uch noble Precepts, that there is nothing honourable that is not accompanied with Innocence; nothing mean but what has Guilt in it; I &s;ay, when they have attained thus much, though Poverty, Pain, and Death, may &s;till retain their Terrors, yet Riches, Plea&s;ures, and Honours, will ea&s;ily lo&s;e their Charms, if they &s;tand between us and our Integrity.</P>
<P>What is here &s;aid with Allu&s;ion to Fortune and Fame, may as ju&s;tly be applied to Wit and Beau|ty; for the&s;e latter are as adventitious as the o|ther, and as little concern the E&s;&s;ence of the Soul. They are all laudable in the Man who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es them only for the ju&s;t Application of them. A bright Imagination, while it is &s;ub&s;ervient to an hone&s;t and noble Soul, is a Faculty which makes a Man ju&s;tly admired by Mankind, and
<PB N="272" REF="282">
furni&s;hes him with Reflections upon his own Actions, which add Delicates to the Fea&s;t of a good Con&s;cience: But when Wit de&s;cends to wait upon &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, or promote the ba&s;e Purpo&s;es of Ambition, it is then to be contemned in Proportion to its Excellence. If a Man will not re&s;olve to place the Foundation of his Happi|ne&s;s in his own Mind, Life is a bewildered and unhappy State, incapable of Re&s;t or Tranquillity: For to &s;uch a one the general Applau&s;e of Valour, Wit, nay of Hone&s;ty it &s;elf, can give him but a very feeble Comfort, &s;ince it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either Under|&s;tanding or Good-nature to &s;ee or acknowledge &s;uch Excellencies. This Rule is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that one may very &s;afely &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know any true Reli&s;h of our Being without it. Look about you in common Life among the ordinary Race of Mankind, and you will find Merit in every Kind is allowed only to tho&s;e who are in particular Di&s;tricts or Sets of Company: But &s;ince Men can have little Plea&s;ure in the&s;e Facul|ties which denominate them Per&s;ons of Di&s;tin|ction, let them give up &s;uch an empty Pur&s;uit, and think nothing e&s;&s;ential to Happine&s;s but what is in their own Power, the Capacity of reflecting with Plea&s;ure on their own Actions, however they are interpreted.</P>
<P>It is &s;o evident a Truth, that it is only in our own Bo&s;oms we are to &s;earch for any Thing to make us happy, that it is, methinks, a Di&s;|grace to our Nature to talk of the taking our Mea&s;ures from thence only as a Matter of For|titude. When all is well there, the Vici&s;&s;itudes and Di&s;tinctions of Life are the meer Scenes of a Drama, and he will never act his Part well who has his Thoughts more fixed upon the Applau&s;e of the Audience than the De&s;ign of his Part.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="283">
The Life of a Man who acts with a &s;teady Inte|grity, without valuing the Interpretation of his Actions, has but one uniform regular Path to move in, where he cannot meet Oppo&s;ition, or fear Am|bu&s;cade. On the other Side, the lea&s;t Deviation from the Rules of Honour introduces a Train of numberle&s;s Evils, and involves him in inexplica|ble Mazes. He that has entred into Guilt has bid Adieu to Re&s;t, and every Criminal has his Share of the Mi&s;ery expre&s;&s;ed &s;o emphatically in the Tra|gedian;</P>

<P>THE following Letter, and &s;everal others to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, accu&s;e me of a Rigour of which I am far from being guilty, to wit, the di&s;allowing the chearful U&s;e of Wine.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="274" REF="284">
<OPENER><DATELINE>From my Country-hou&s;e, <DATE>Oct. 25.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t Drinking, in <HI>Tue&s;day's Tatler,</HI> I like well enough in the main; but in my humble Opinion, you are become too ri|gid where you &s;ay to this Effect: [Were there only this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, that we are the le&s;s Ma&s;ters of our &s;elves if we drink the lea&s;t Proportion beyond the Exigence of Thir&s;t.] I hope no one drinks Wine to allay this Appetite. This &s;eems to be de&s;igned for a loftier Indulgence of Nature; for it were hard to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Author of Nature, who impo&s;ed upon her her Nece&s;&s;ities and Pains, does not allow her her Plea&s;ures, and we may reckon among the latter the moderate U&s;e of the Grape: And though I am as much again&s;t Exce&s;s, or whatever ap|proaches it, as your &s;elf, yet I conceive one may &s;afely go farther than the Bounds you there pre|&s;cribe, not only without forfeiting the Title of being one's own Ma&s;ter, but al&s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in a much greater Degree. If a Man's expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf upon any Subject with more Life and Vivacity, more Variety of Idea's, more copiou&s;|ly, more fluently, and more to the Purpo&s;e, ar|gues it he thinks clearer, &s;peaks more ready, and with greater Choice of comprehen&s;ive and &s;ignificant Terms. I have the good Fortune now to be intimate with a Gentleman remark|able for this Temper, who has an inexhau&s;tible Source of Wit to entertain the Curious, the Grave, the Humorous, and the Frolick. He can transform him&s;elf into different Shapes, and a|dapt him&s;elf to every Company; yet in a Cof|fee-hou&s;e, or in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Affairs, appears rather dull than &s;prightly. You can &s;eldom get him to the Tavern, but when once he is is arrived to his Pint, and begins to look a|bout and like his Company, you admire a Thou|&s;and
<PB N="275" REF="285">
Things in him, which before lay buried. Then you di&s;cover the Brightne&s;s of his Mind, and the Strength of his Judgment, accompanied with the mo&s;t graceful Mirth. In a Word, by this enlivening Aid, he is whatever is polite, in&s;tructive, and diverting. What makes him &s;till more agreeable is, that he tells a Story, &s;erious or comical, with as much Delicacy of Humour as <HI>Cervantes</HI> him&s;elf. And for all this, at other Times, even after a long Knowledge of him, you &s;hall &s;carce di&s;cern in this incomparable Per&s;on a whit more than what might be ex|pected from one of a common Capacity. Doubt|le&s;s, there are Men of great Parts that are guilty of downright Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, that by a &s;trange He|&s;itation and Reluctance to &s;peak, murder the fi|ne&s;t and mo&s;t elegant Thoughts, and render the mo&s;t lively Conceptions flat and heavy.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e, a certain Quantity of my White or Red Cordial, which you will, is an ea&s;ie, but an infallible Remedy. It awakens the Judgment, quickens Memory, ripens Under&s;tanding, di&s;|per&s;es Melancholy, chears the Heart; in a Word, re&s;tores the whole Man to him&s;elf and his Friends without the lea&s;t Pain or Indi&s;po&s;i|tion to the Patient. To be taken only in the Evening in a rea&s;onable Quantity before going to Bed. <HI>Note,</HI> My Bottles are &s;ealed with Three Flower-de-Luces and a Bunch of Grapes. Be|ware of Counterfeits.

<P>Whatever has been &s;aid again&s;t the U&s;e of Wine, upon the Suppo&s;ition that it enfeebles the Mind, and renders it unfit for the Duties of Life, bears forcibly to the Advantage of that delicious Juice, in Ca&s;es where it only heightens Conver&s;ation, and brings to Light agreeable Talents, which otherwi&s;e would have lain concealed under the
<PB N="276" REF="286">
Oppre&s;&s;ion of an unju&s;t Mode&s;ty. I mu&s;t acknow|ledge I have &s;een many of the Temper mentioned by this Corre&s;pondent, and own, Wine may very allowably be u&s;ed in a Degree above the Supply of meer Nece&s;&s;ity by &s;uch as labour under Melan|choly, or are Tongue-ty'd by Mode&s;ty. It is cer|tainly a very agreeable Change, when we &s;ee a Gla&s;s rai&s;e a lifele&s;s Conver&s;ation into all the Plea&s;ures of Wit and good Humour. But when <HI>Caska</HI> adds to his natural Impudence the Flu&s;ter of a Bottle, that which Fools called Fire when he was &s;ober, all Men abhor as Outrage when he is drunk. Thus he that in the Morning was only &s;aucy, is in the Evening tumultuous. It makes one &s;ick to hear one of the&s;e Fellows &s;ay, They love a Friend and a Bottle. Noi&s;y Mirth has &s;omething too ru&s;tick in it to be con&s;idered with|out Terror by Men of Politene&s;s: But while the Di&s;cour&s;e improves in a well cho&s;en Company, from the Addition of Spirits which flow from moderate Cups, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Lei&s;ure Time cannot be more agreeably, or per|haps more u&s;efully employed than at &s;uch Meet|ings: But there is a certain Prudence in this and all other Circum&s;tances which makes Right or Wrong in the Conduct of ordinary Life. Sir <HI>Jeof|frey Wildacre</HI> has nothing &s;o much at Heart as that his Son &s;hould know the World betimes: For this End he introduces him among the Sots of his own Age, where the Boy learns to laugh at his Father from the Familiarity with which he &s;ees him treated by his Equals. This the old Fellow calls Living well with his Heir, and teaching him to be too much his Friend to be impatient for his E&s;tate. But for the more exact Regulation of Society in this and other Matters, I &s;hall publi&s;h Tables of the Characters and Relations among Men, and by them in&s;truct the Town in making Sets and Companies for a Bottle. This Humour
<PB N="277" REF="287">
of Sir <HI>Jeoffrey</HI> &s;hall be taken Notice of in the fir&s;t Place; for there is, methinks, a Sort of Ince&s;t in Drunkenne&s;s, and Sons are not to behold Fathers &s;tripped of all Reverence.</P>
<P>It is &s;hocking in Nature for the Young, to &s;ee tho&s;e whom they &s;hould have an Awe for in Cir|cum&s;tances of Contempt. I &s;hall therefore utter|ly forbid, that tho&s;e in whom Nature &s;hould ad|moni&s;h to avoid too gro&s;s Familiarities, &s;hall be received in Parties of Plea&s;ure where there is the lea&s;t Danger of Exce&s;s. I &s;hould run through the whole Doctrine of Drinking, but that my Thoughts are at pre&s;ent too much employed in the Model|ling <HI>my Court of Honour;</HI> and altering the Seats, Benches, Bar, and Canopy from that of the Court wherein I la&s;t Winter &s;ate upon Cau&s;es of le&s;s Mo|ment. By the Way I &s;hall take an Opportunity to examine, what Method is to be taken to make Joiners and other Artificers get out of a Hou&s;e they have once entered, not forgetting to tie them under proper Regulations. It is for Want of &s;uch Rules, that I have a Day or two longer than I expected been tormented and deafened with Ham|mers, in&s;omuch that I neither can pur&s;ue this Di&s;cour&s;e, or an&s;wer the following and many other Letters of the highe&s;t Importance.</P>

Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> recei|ved it, and after having &s;urveyed the Breadth of the Blade, and Sharpne&s;s of the Point, with more
<PB N="279" REF="289">
than ordinary Attention, returned it to the Fore|man in a very graceful Manner. The re&s;t of the Jury, upon the Delivery of the Sword to their Foreman, drew all of them together as one Man, and &s;aluted the Bench with &s;uch an Air, as &s;igni|fied the mo&s;t re&s;igned Submi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who commanded them, and the greate&s;t Magnanimity to execute what they &s;hould command.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> after having received the Com|pliments on his Right Hand, ca&s;t his Eye upon the Left, where the whole Female Jury paid their Re&s;pects by a low Courte&s;ie, and by laying their Hands upon their Mouths. Their Forewoman was a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Platoni&s;t,</HI> that had &s;pent much of her Time in exhorting the Sex to &s;et a ju&s;t Value upon their Per&s;ons, and to make the Men know them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>There followed a profound Silence, when at length, after &s;ome Recollection, the Cen&s;or, who continued hitherto uncovered, put on his Hat with great Dignity; and after having compo&s;ed the Brims of it in a Manner &s;uitable to the Gravi|ty of his Character, he gave the following Charge, which was received with Silence and Attention, that being the only Applau&s;e which he admits of, or is ever given in his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<Q><P>The Nature of my Office, and the Solemnity of this Occa&s;ion, requiring that I &s;hould open my Fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion with a Speech, I &s;hall ca&s;t what I have to &s;ay under Two principal Heads.</P>
<P>Under the Fir&s;t, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the Nece&s;&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of this new-erected Court; and under the Second, I &s;hall give a Word of Advice and In&s;truction to every con&s;tituent Part of it.</P>
<P>As for the Fir&s;t, it is well ob&s;erved by <HI>Phaedrus</HI> an Heathen Poet,
<Q><PB N="280" REF="290">
<L>Ni&s;i utile e&s;t quod facimus, fru&s;tra e&s;t Gloria.</L></Q>
Which is the &s;ame, Ladies, as if I &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>It would be of no Reputation for me to be Pre&s;ident of a Court which is of no Benefit to the Publick.</HI> Now the Advantages that may ari&s;e to the Weal-Publick from this In&s;titution will more plainly appear, if we con&s;ider what it &s;uffers for the Want of it. Are not our Streets daily filled with wild Pieces of Ju&s;tice and random Penalties? Are not Crimes undetermined, and Reparations di&s;proportioned? How often have we &s;een the Lye puni&s;hed by Death, and the Lyar him&s;elf deciding his own Cau&s;e? nay, not only acting the Judge, but the Excutioner? Have we not known a Box on the Ear more &s;e|verely accounted for than Man&s;laughter? In the&s;e Extrajudicial Proceedings of Mankind, an unmannerly Je&s;t is frequently as Capital as a premeditated Murder.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t pernicious Circum&s;tance in this Ca&s;e is, that the Man who &s;uffers the Injury mu&s;t put him&s;elf upon the &s;ame Foot of Danger with him that gave it, before he can have his ju&s;t Revenge; &s;o that the Puni&s;hment is altoge|ther accidental, and may fall as well upon the Innocent as the Guilty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention a Ca&s;e which happens frequently among the more polite Nations of the World, and which I the rather mention, be|cau&s;e both Sexes are concerned in it, and which therefore you Gentlemen and you Ladies of the Jury will the rather take Notice of; I mean that great and known Ca&s;e of Cuckoldom. Suppo&s;ing the Per&s;on who has &s;uffered In&s;ults in his dearer and better-Half; &s;uppo&s;ing, I &s;ay, this Per&s;on &s;hould re&s;ent the Injuries done to his tender Wife, What is the Reparation he may expect? Why, to be u&s;ed wor&s;e than his poor Lady, run through the Body, and left
<PB N="281" REF="291">
Breathle&s;s upon the Bed of Honour. What then will you on my Right Hand &s;ay mu&s;t the Man do that is affronted? Mu&s;t our Sides be elbow|ed, our Shins broken? Mu&s;t the Wall, or per|haps our Mi&s;tre&s;s, be taken from us? May a Man knit his Forhead into a Frown, to&s;s up his Arm, on pi&s;h at what we &s;ay, and mu&s;t the Villain live after it? Is there no Redre&s;s for injured Honour? Yes, Gentlemen, that is the De&s;ign of the Judicature we have here e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A Court of Con&s;cience, we very well know, was fir&s;t in&s;tituted for the determining of &s;e|veral Points of Property that were too little and trivial for the Cognizance of higher Courts of Ju&s;tice. In the &s;ame Manner, our Court of Ho|nour is appointed for the Examination of &s;eve|ral Niceties and Punctilio's that do not pa&s;s for Wrongs in the Eye of our common Laws. But notwith&s;tanding no Legi&s;lators of any Nation have taken into Con&s;ideration the&s;e little Cir|cum&s;tances, they are &s;uch as often lead to Crimes big enough for their In&s;pection, though they come before them too late for their Re|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I appeal to you, Ladies, <HI>[Here Mr.</HI> Bick|er&s;taff <HI>turned to his Left Hand]</HI> if the&s;e are not the little Stings and Thorns in Life that make it more unea&s;y than its mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Evils? Confe&s;s ingenuou&s;ly, Did you never lo&s;e a Morn|ning's Devotions becau&s;e you could not offer them up from the highe&s;t Place of the Pew? Have you not been in Pain, even at a Ball, becau&s;e ano|ther has been taken out to dance before you? Do you love any of your Friends &s;o much as tho&s;e that are below you? Or have you any Favourites that walk on your Right Hand? You have an&s;wered me in your Looks, I ask no more.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="292">
I come now to the Second Part of my Di&s;|cour&s;e, which obliges me to addre&s;s my &s;elf in particular to the re&s;pective Members of the Court, in which I &s;hall be very brief.</P>
<P>As for you, Gentlemen and Ladies my A&s;&s;i&s;tants and Grand Juries, I have made Choice of you on my Right Hand, becau&s;e I know you very jealous of your Honour; and you on my Left, becau&s;e I know you very much concerned for the Reputation of others; for which Rea|&s;on I expect great Exactne&s;s and Impartiality in your Verdicts and Judgments.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in the next Place addre&s;s my &s;elf to you, Gentlemen of the Council: You all know, that I have not cho&s;en you for your Knowledge in the litigious Parts of the Law, but becau&s;e you have all of you formerly fought Duels, of which I have Rea&s;on to think you have repent|ed, as being now &s;ettled in the peaceable State of Benchers. My Advice to you is, only that in your Pleadings you are &s;hort and expre&s;&s;ive: To which End you are to bani&s;h out of your Di&s;|cour&s;es all &s;ynonymous Terms, and unnece&s;&s;ary Multiplications of Verbs and Nouns. I do more|over forbid you the U&s;e of the Words <HI>al&s;o</HI> and <HI>likewi&s;e;</HI> and mu&s;t further declare, That if I catch any one among you, upon any Pretence what&s;oever, u&s;ing the Particle <HI>or,</HI> I &s;hall ince&s;|&s;antly order him to be &s;tripped of his Gown, and thrown over the Bar.</P></Q>

<P>THere are no Books which I more delight in than in Travels, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that de&s;cribe remote Countries, and give the Writer an Oppor|tunity of &s;howing his Parts without incurring any Danger of being examined or contradicted. Among all the Authors of this Kind, our re|nowned Countryman Sir <HI>John Mandeville</HI> has di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, by the Copiou&s;ne&s;s of his Invention, and Greatne&s;s of his Genius. The Second to Sir <HI>John</HI> I take to have been <HI>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</HI> a Per&s;on of infinite Adventure, and unbounded Imagination. One reads the Voyages of the&s;e Two great Wits with as much A&s;toni&s;hment as the Travels of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in <HI>Homer,</HI> or of the <HI>Red Cro&s;s</HI> Knight in <HI>Spencer.</HI> All is En|chanted Ground, and Fairy Land.</P>
<P>I have got into my Hands by great Chance &s;e|veral Manu&s;cripts of the&s;e Two eminent Authors, which are filled with greater Wonders than any of tho&s;e they have communicated to the Publick; and indeed, were they not &s;o well atte&s;ted, would appear altogether improbable. I am apt to think, the ingenious Authors did not publi&s;h them with the re&s;t of their Works, le&s;t they &s;hould pa&s;s for Fictions and Fables: A Caution not unnece&s;&s;ary, when the Reputation of their Veracity was not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed in the World. But as this Rea&s;on has now no further Weight.
<PB N="284" REF="294">
I &s;hall make the Publick a Pre&s;ent of the&s;e curious Pieces at &s;uch Times as I &s;hall find my &s;elf un|provided with other Subjects.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Paper I intend to fill with an Ex|tract of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Journal, in which that learned and worthy Knight gives an Account of the Freezing and Thawing of &s;everal &s;hort Speeches which he made in the Territories of <HI>Nova Zem|bla.</HI> I need not inform my Reader, that the Au|thor of <HI>Hudibras</HI> alludes to this &s;trange Quality in that cold Climate, when, &s;peaking of ab&s;tra|cted Notions cloathed in a vi&s;ible Shape, he adds that apt Simile,</P>
<Q><L>Like Words congeal'd in Northern Air.</L></Q>
<P>Not to keep my Reader any longer in Su&s;pence, the Relation put into modern Language is as fol|lows:</P>
<P>We were &s;eparated by a Storm in the Latitude of 73, in&s;omuch that only the Ship which I was in, with a <HI>Dutch</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, got &s;afe into a Creek of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> We landed, in order to re&s;it our Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;tore our &s;elves with Provi&s;ions. The Crew of each Ve&s;&s;el made them&s;elves a Cabbin of Turf and Wood, at &s;ome Di&s;tance from each other, to fence them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the Inclemencies of the Weather, which was &s;evere beyond Imagination. We &s;oon ob|&s;erved, that in talking to one another we lo&s;t &s;e|veral of our Words, and could not hear one ano|ther at above Two Yards Di&s;tance, and that too when we &s;at very near the Fire. After much Perplexity, I found that our Words froze in the Air before they could reach the Ears of the Per|&s;on to whom they were &s;poken. I was &s;oon con|firmed in this Conjecture, when, upon the Increa&s;e of the Cold, the whole Company grew dumb, or rather deaf; for every Man was &s;en&s;ible, as we afterwards found, that he &s;poke as well as ever; but the Sounds no &s;ooner took Air, than
<PB N="285" REF="295">
they were conden&s;ed and lo&s;t. It was now a mi&s;erable Spectacle to &s;ee us nodding and gaping at one another, every Man talking, and no Man heard. One might ob&s;erve a Seaman, that could hail a Ship at a League di&s;tance, beckoning with his Hands, &s;training his Lungs, and tearing his Throat, but all in vain.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Nec vox, nec Verba, &s;equuntur.</L></Q>
<P>We continued here Three Weeks in this di&s;mal Plight. At length, upon a Turn of Wind, the Air about us began to thaw. Our Cabbin was immediately filled with a dry clattering Sound, which I afterwards found to be the Crackling of Con&s;onants that broke above our Heads, and were often mixed with a gentle Hi&s;&s;ing, which I imputed to the Letter <HI>S,</HI> that occurs &s;o fre|quently in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue. I &s;oon after felt a Breeze of Whi&s;pers ru&s;hing by my Ear; for tho&s;e being of a &s;oft and gentle Sub&s;tance, im|mediately liquefied in the warm Wind that blew acro&s;s our Cabbin. The&s;e were &s;oon followed by Syllables and &s;hort Words, and at length by entire Sentences, that melted &s;ooner or later, as they were more or le&s;s congealed; &s;o that we now heard every Thing that had been <HI>&s;poken</HI> du|ring the whole Three Weeks that we had been <HI>&s;ilent,</HI> if I may u&s;e that Expre&s;&s;ion. It was now very early in the Morning, and yet, to my Sur|prize, I heard &s;ome Body &s;ay, <HI>Sir</HI> John, <HI>it is Mid|night, and Time for the Ship's Crew to go to Bed.</HI> This I knew to be the Pilot's Voice, and upon re|collecting my &s;elf, I concluded that he had &s;po|ken the&s;e Words to me &s;ome Days before, though I could not hear them before the pre&s;ent Thaw. My Reader will ea&s;ily imagine how the whole Crew was amazed, to hear every Man talking, and &s;ee no Man opening his Mouth. In the Mid&s;t of this great Surprize we were all in, we heard a Volley of Oaths and Cur&s;es, la&s;ting for
<PB N="286" REF="296">
a long while, and uttered in a very hoar&s;e Voice, which I knew belonged to the Boat&s;wain, who was a very cholerick Fellow, and had taken his Opportunity of Cur&s;ing and Swearing at me when he thought I could not hear him; for I had &s;everal Times given him the Strappado on that Account, as I did not fail to repeat it for the&s;e his pious Soliloquies when I got him on Ship|board.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit the Names of &s;everal Beauties in <HI>Wapping,</HI> which were heard every now and then, in the Mid&s;t of a long Sigh that accompa|nied them; as, Dear <HI>Kate!</HI> Pretty Mrs. <HI>Peggy!</HI> When &s;hall I &s;ee my <HI>Sue</HI> again? This betray'd &s;everal Amours which had been concealed till that Time, and furni&s;hed us with a great deal of Mirth in our Return to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When this Confu&s;ion of Voices was pretty well over, though I was afraid to offer at Speaking, as fearing I &s;hould not be heard, I propo&s;ed a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Cabbin, which lay about a Mile further up into the Country. My Crew were extreamly rejoiced to find they had again recovered their Hearing, though every Man ut|tered his Voice with the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions that I had done!</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Et timide Verba intermi&s;&s;a retentat.</L></Q>
<P>At about half a Mile's Di&s;tance from our Cab|bin, we heard the Groanings of a Bear, which at fir&s;t &s;tartled us; but upon Enquiry we were in|formed by &s;ome of our Company, that he was dead, and now lay in Salt, having been killed upon that very Spot about a Fortnight before, in the Time of the Fro&s;t. Not far from the &s;ame Place we were likewi&s;e entertained with &s;ome po&s;thumous Snarls and Barkings of a Fox.</P>
<P>We at length arrived at the little <HI>Dutch</HI> Settle|ment, and upon entering the Room, found it filled
<PB N="287" REF="297">
with Sighs that &s;melt of Brandy, and &s;everal o|ther un&s;avourly Sounds that were altogether in|articulate. My Valet, who was an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> fell into &s;o great a Rage at what he heard, that he drew his Sword; but not knowing where to lay the Blame, he put it up again. We were &s;tun|ned with the&s;e confu&s;ed Noi&s;es, but did not hear a &s;ingle Word till about half an Hour after; which I a&s;cribed to the har&s;h and obdurate Sounds of that Language, which wanted more Time than ours to melt and become audible.</P>
<P>After having here met with a very hearty Wel|come, we went to the <HI>French</HI> Cabbin, who, to make Amends for their Three Weeks Silence, were Talking and Di&s;puting with greater Rapi|dity and Confu&s;ion than ever I heard in an A&s;|&s;embly even of that Nation. Their Language as I found, upon the fir&s;t Giving of the Weather, &s;ell a&s;under and di&s;&s;olved. I was here convinced of an Error into which I had before fallen; for I fancied, that for the Freezing of the Sound, it was nece&s;&s;ary for it to be wrapped up, and, as it were, pre&s;erved in Breath; but I found my Mi|&s;take, when I heard the Sound of a Kit playing a Minuet over our Heads. I asked the Occa&s;ion of it; upon which one of the Company told me, that it would play there above a Week longer if the Thaw continued; for, &s;ays he, finding our &s;elves bereft of Speech, we prevailed upon one of the Company, who had this Mu&s;ical In&s;tru|ment about him, to play to us from Morning to Night; all which Time we employed in Dan|cing, in order to di&s;&s;ipate our Chagrin, &amp; <HI>tuer le Temps.</HI></P>
<P>Here Sir <HI>John</HI> gives very good Philo&s;ophical Rea&s;ons why the Kit could be heard during the Fro&s;t; but as they are &s;omething Prolix, I pa&s;s them over in Silence, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the honourable Author &s;eems, by his Quo|tations, to have been well ver&s;ed in the ancient

<P>I AM at pre&s;ent under very great Difficulties, which it is not in the Power of any one, be|&s;ides your &s;elf, to redre&s;s. Whether or no you &s;hall think it a proper Ca&s;e to come before your <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> I cannot tell; but thus it is: I am Chaplain to an honourable Family, very regular at the Hours of Devotion, and I hope of an unblameable Life; but for not offer|ing to ri&s;e at Second Cour&s;e, I found my Patron and his Lady very &s;ullen and out of Humour, though at fir&s;t I did not know the Rea&s;on of it. At length, when I happened to help my &s;elf to a Jelly, the Lady of the Hou&s;e, other|wi&s;e a devout Woman, told me, That it did not become a Man of my Cloth to delight in &s;uch frivolous Food: But as I &s;till continued to &s;it out the la&s;t Cour&s;e, I was Ye&s;terday infor|med by the Butler, that his Lord&s;hip had no further Occa&s;ion for my Service.

</LETTER>
<P>The Ca&s;e of this Gentleman de&s;erves Pity, e|&s;pecially if he loves Sweetmeats, to which, if I may gue&s;s by his Letter, he is no Enemy. In the mean Time, I have often wondered at the Indecency of di&s;carding the holie&s;t Man from the Table as &s;oon as the mo&s;t delicious Parts of the Entertainment are &s;erved up, and could never conceive a Rea&s;on for &s;o ab&s;urd a Cu&s;tom. Is it becau&s;e a liquori&s;h Palate, or a &s;weet Tooth (as they call it) is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Sanctity of his Character? This is but a trifling Pretence. No Man of the mo&s;t rigid Virtue gives Offence by any Exce&s;&s;es in Plumb-Pudding or Plumb-Por|ridge, and that, becau&s;e they are the fir&s;t Parts of the Dinner. Is there any Thing that tends to Incitation in Sweetmeats more than in ordi|nary Di&s;hes? Certainly not. Sugar-Plumbs are a very innocent Diet, and Con&s;erves of a much colder Nature than your common Pickles. I have &s;ometimes thought, that the Ceremony of the Chaplain's flying away from the De&s;&s;ert was Typical and Figurative, to mark out to the Com|pany how they ought to retire from all the lu&s;|cious Baits of Temptation, and deny their Appe|tites the Gratifications that are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to them; or at lea&s;t to &s;ignify, that we ought to &s;tint our &s;elves in our mo&s;t lawful Satisfactions, and not make our Plea&s;ure, but our Support, the End of Eating: But mo&s;t certainly, if &s;uch a Le&s;&s;on of Temperance had been nece&s;&s;ary at a Table, our Clergy would have recommended it to all the Lay-Ma&s;ters of Families, and not have di&s;turbed other Men's Tables with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;on|able Examples of Ab&s;tinence.

<HEAD>The Proceedings of the <HI>Court of Honour,</HI> held in <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 20th of <HI>Novem+ber,</HI> 1710. before <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PEter Plumb,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Merchant, was in|dicted by the Honourable Mr. <HI>Thomas Gules,</HI> of <HI>Gule-Hall</HI> in the Country of <HI>Salop,</HI> for that the &s;aid <HI>Peter Plumb</HI> did in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet, London,</HI> between the Hours of Two and Three in the Afternoon, meet the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Thomas Gules,</HI> and after a &s;hort Salutation, put on his Hat, Value Five-Pence, while the Honourable Mr. <HI>Gules</HI> &s;tood bare-headed for the Space of Two Seconds. It was further urged again&s;t the Criminal, That during his Di&s;cour&s;e with the Pro&s;ecutor, he fe|loniou&s;ly &s;tole the Wall of him, having clapped his Back again&s;t it in &s;uch a Manner that it was impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. <HI>Gules</HI> to recover it again at his taking Leave of him. The Pro&s;ecutor alledged, That he was the Cadet of a very ancient Family; and that according to the Principles of all the younger Brothers of the &s;aid Family, he had ne|ver &s;ullied him&s;elf with Bu&s;ine&s;s, but had cho&s;en rather to &s;tarve like a Man of Honour, than do any Thing beneath his Quality. He produced &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es, that he had never employed him&s;elf beyond the Twi&s;ting of a Whip, or the Making of a Pair of Nut-Crackers, in which he
<PB N="294" REF="304">
only worked for his Diver&s;ion, in order to mae a Pre&s;ent now and then to his Friends. The Pri|&s;oner being asked what he could &s;ay for him&s;elf, ca&s;t &s;everal Reflections upon the Honourable Mr. <HI>Gules;</HI> as, That he was not worth a Groat; That no Body in the City would tru&s;t him for a Hal&s;penny; That he owed him Money, which he had promi&s;ed to pay him &s;everal Times, but ne|ver kept his Word: And in &s;hort, That he was an idle, beggarly Fellow, and of no U&s;e to the Publick. This Sort of Language was very &s;e|verely reprimanded by the Cen&s;or, who told the Criminal, That he &s;poke in Contempt of the Court, and that he &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t for Contumacy, if he did not change his Style. The Pri&s;oner therefore de&s;ired to be heard by his Council, who urged in his Defence, That he put on his Hat through Ignorance, and took the Wall by Accident. They likewi&s;e produced &s;e|veral Witne&s;&s;es, That he made &s;everal Motions with his Hat in his Hand, which are generally under&s;tood as an Invitation to the Per&s;on we talk with to be covered; and that the Gentleman not taking the Hint, he was forced to put on his Hat, as being troubled with a Cold. There was likewi&s;e an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man who depo&s;ed, That he had heard him cough Three and twenty times that Morning. And as for the Wall, it was alledged That he had taken it inadvertently, to &s;ave him|&s;elf from a Shower of Rain which was then fal|ling. The Cen&s;or having con&s;ulted the Men of Honour who &s;at at his Right Hand on the Bench, found they were all of Opinion, That the De|fence made by the Pri&s;oner's Council did rather aggravate than extenuate his Crime; That the Motions and Intimations of the Hat were a To|ken of Superiority in Conver&s;ation, and therefore not to be u&s;ed by the Criminal to a Man of the Pro&s;ecutor's Quality, who was likewi&s;e ve&s;ted with a double Title to the Wall at the Time of

The Evidence being very full and clear, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry, without going out of Court, declared their Opinion unanimou&s;ly by the Mouth of their Fore|man, That the Pro&s;ecutor was bound in Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o make the Sun &s;hine through the Criminal, or, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s they afterwards explained them&s;elves, to whip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">im through the Lungs.</P>

The Jury therefore re|tired, and being willing to comply with the Ad|vices of the Cen&s;or, after an Hour's Con&s;ulta|tion, declared their Opinion as follows:</P>
<P>That in Con&s;ideration this was <HI>Peter Plumb</HI>'s fir&s;t Offence, and that there did not appear any <HI>Malice prepen&s;e</HI> in it, as al&s;o that he lived in good Reputation among his Neighbours, and that his taking the Wall was only <HI>&s;e defendendo,</HI> the Pro|&s;ecutor &s;hould let him e&s;cape with Life, and content him&s;elf with the Slitting of his No&s;e, and the Cutting off both his Ears. Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff</HI> &s;miling upon the Court, told them, That he thought the Puni&s;hment, even under its pre&s;ent Mitigation, too &s;evere; and that &s;uch Penalties might be of ill Con&s;equence in a Trading Na|tion. He therefore pronounced Sentence again&s;t the Criminal in the following Manner: That his Hat, which was the In&s;trument of Offence, &s;hould be forfeited to the Court; That the Criminal &s;hould go to the Warehou&s;e from whence he came, and thence, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould require, proceed to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or <HI>Garraway</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, in what Manner he plea&s;ed; but that neither he nor any of the Family of the

<P><HI>Richard Newman</HI> was indicted by Major <HI>Punto,</HI> for having u&s;ed the Words, <HI>Perhaps it may be &s;o,</HI> in a Di&s;pute with the &s;aid Major. The Major urged, That the Word, <HI>Perhaps,</HI> was que&s;tioning his Veracity, and that it was an indirect Manner of giving him the Lye. <HI>Richard Newman</HI> had nothing more to &s;ay for him&s;elf, than that he in|tended no &s;uch Thing, and threw him&s;elf upon the Mercy of the Court. The Jury brought in their Verdict Special.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> &s;tood up, and after having ca&s;t his Eyes over the whole A&s;&s;embly, hem'd thrice. He then acquainted them, That he had laid down a Rule to him&s;elf, which he was re&s;olved never to depart from, and which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the &s;hortening the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Court; I mean, &s;ays he, never to allow of the Lye being given by Con&s;truction, Implication, or Induction, but by the &s;ole U&s;e of the Word it &s;elf. He then proceeded to &s;how the great Mi&s;chiefs that had ari&s;en to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation from that pernicious Mono&s;yllable; That it had bred the mo&s;t fatal Quarrels between the deare&s;t Friends; That it had frequently thin'd the Guards, and made great Havock in the Ar|my; That it had &s;ometimes weaken'd the City Trained Bands; and, in a Word, had de&s;troved many of the brave&s;t Men in the I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> For the Prevention of which Evils for the future, he in&s;tructed the Jury to <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> the Word it &s;elf as a Nu&s;ance in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; and further promi&s;ed them, That he would, up|on &s;uch their Pre&s;entment, publi&s;h an Edict of the Court for the entire Bani&s;hment and Exclu|&s;ion of it out of the Di&s;cour&s;es and Conver&s;ation of all civil Societies.</P>

<P>EVery Nation is di&s;tingui&s;hed by Productions that are peculiar to it. <HI>Great Britain</HI> is par|ticularly fruitful in Religions, that &s;hoot up and flouri&s;h in this Climate more than in any other. We are &s;o famous Abroad for our great Variety of Sects and Opinions, that an ingenious Friend of mine, who is lately returned from his Tra|vels, a&s;&s;ures me, there is a Show at this Time <HI>carried</HI> up and down in <HI>Germany,</HI> which repre|&s;ents all the Religions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in Wax|work. Notwith&s;tanding that the Pliancy of the Matter in which the Images are wrought makes it capable of being moulded into all Shapes and Figures, my Friend tells me, that he did not think it po&s;&s;ible for it to be twi&s;ted and tortured into &s;o many skrew'd Faces and wry Features as appeared in &s;everal of the Figures that compo&s;ed the Show. I was indeed &s;o plea&s;ed with the De|&s;ign of the <HI>German</HI> Arti&s;t, that I begged my Friend to give me an Account of it in all its Par|ticulars, which he did after the following Man|ner.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="309">
I have often, &s;ays he, been pre&s;ent at a Show of Elephants, Camels, Dromedaries, and other &s;trange Creatures, but I never &s;aw &s;o great an A&s;&s;embly of Spectators as were met together at the Opening of this great Piece of Wax-work. We were all placed in a large Hall, according to the Price that we had paid for our Seats: The Curtain that hung before the Show was made by a Ma&s;ter of Tape&s;try, who had woven it in the Figure of a mon&s;trous <HI>Hydra</HI> that had &s;everal Heads, which brandi&s;hed out their Tongues, and &s;eemed to hi&s;s at each other. Some of the&s;e Heads were large and entire; and where any of them had been lopped away, there &s;prouted up &s;everal in the Room of them; in&s;omuch that for one Head cut off, a Man might &s;ee Ten, Twen|ty, or an Hundred, of a &s;maller Size, creeping through the Wound. In &s;hort, the whole Picture was nothing but Confu&s;ion and Blood&s;hed. On a &s;udden, &s;ays my Friend, I was &s;tartled with a Flouri&s;h of many Mu&s;ical In&s;truments that I had never heard before, which was followed by a &s;hort Tune, (if it might be &s;o called) wholly made up of Jars and Di&s;cords. Among the re&s;t, there was an Organ, a Bagpipe, a Groaning-Board, a Stentorophonick-Trumpet, with &s;everal Wind In&s;truments of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Sound, which I do not &s;o much as know the Name of. After a &s;hort Flouri&s;h, the Curtain was drawn up, and we were pre&s;ented with the mo&s;t extraordinary A&s;&s;embly of Figures that ever entered into a Man's Imagination. The De&s;ign of the Work|man was &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed in the dumb Show before us, that it was not hard for an <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> to comprehend the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>The principal Figures were placed in a Row, con&s;i&s;ting of Seven Per&s;ons. The middle Figure, which immediately attracted the Eyes of the whole Company, and was much bigger than the re&s;t, was formed like a Matron, dre&s;&s;ed in the Habit
<PB N="300" REF="310">
of an elderly Woman of Quality in Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>'s Days. The mo&s;t remarkable Parts of her Dre&s;s, was the Beaver with the Steeple Crown, the Scarf that was darker than Sable, and the Lawn Apron that was whiter than Er|min. Her Gown was of the riche&s;t black Vel|vet, and ju&s;t upon her Heart &s;tudded with large Diamonds of an ine&s;timable Value, di&s;po&s;ed in the Form of a Cro&s;s. She bore an inexpre&s;&s;ible Chearfulne&s;s and Dignity in her A&s;pect; and though &s;he &s;eemed in Years, appeared with &s;o much Spirit and Vivacity, as gave her at the &s;ame Time an Air of old Age and Immortality. I found my Heart touched with &s;o much Love and Reverence at the Sight of her, that the Tears ran down my Face as I looked upon her; and &s;till the more I looked upon her, the more my Heart was melted with the Sentiments of Filial Tenderne&s;s and Duty. I di&s;covered every Mo|ment &s;omething &s;o charming in this Figure, that I could &s;carce take my Eyes off it. On its Right Hand there &s;at the Figure of a Woman &s;o covered with Ornaments, that her Face, her Body, and her Hands, were almo&s;t entirely hid under them. The little you could &s;ee of her Face was painted; and what I thought very odd, had &s;omething in it like artificial Wrinkles; but I was the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at it, when I &s;aw upon her Forehead an old-fa&s;hioned Tower of grey Hairs. Her Head-Dre&s;s ro&s;e very high by Three &s;everal Stories or Degrees; her Garments had a Thou&s;and Colours in them, and were embroi|dered with Cro&s;&s;es in Gold, Silver and Silk: She had nothing on, &s;o much as a Glove or a Slipper, which was not marked with this Figure; nay, &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fond did &s;he appear of it, that &s;he &s;at cro&s;s-legged. I was quickly &s;ick of this tawdry Compo&s;ition of Ribands, Silks and Jewels, and therefore ca&s;t my Eye on a Dame which was ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of it. I need not tell
<PB N="301" REF="311">
my Reader, that the Lady before de&s;cribed was <HI>Popery,</HI> or that &s;he I am now going to de&s;cribe is <HI>Presbytery.</HI> She &s;at on the Left Hand of the ve|nerable Matron, and &s;o much re&s;embled her in the Features of her Countenance, that &s;he &s;eemed her Si&s;ter; but at the &s;ame Time that one ob&s;er|ved a Likne&s;s in her Beauty, one could not but take Notice, that there was &s;omething in it &s;ickly and &s;plenatick. Her Face had enough to di&s;cover the Relation, but it was drawn up into a peevi&s;h Figure, &s;owred with Di&s;content, and overca&s;t with Melancholy. She &s;eemed offended at the Matron for the Shape of her Hat, as too much re&s;embling the triple Coronet of the Per&s;on who &s;at by her. One might &s;ee likewi&s;e, that &s;he di&s;&s;ented from the white Apron and the Cro&s;s; for which Rea&s;ons &s;he had made her &s;elf a plain, homely Dowdy, and turned her Face towards the Sectaries that &s;at on her Left Hand, as being a|fraid of looking upon the Matron, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;ee the Harlot by her.</P>
<P>On the Right Hand of <HI>Popery</HI> &s;at <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> re|pre&s;ented by an old Man embroidered with Phy|lacteries, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by many Typical Fi|gures, which I had not Skill enough to unriddle. He was placed among the Rubbi&s;h of a Temple; but in&s;tead of weeping over it, (which I &s;hould have expected from him) he was counting out a Bag of Money upon the Ruins of it.</P>
<P>On his Right Hand was <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> or <HI>Natural Re|ligion.</HI> This was a Figure of an half-naked auk|ward Country Wench, who with proper Orna|ments and Education would have made an agree|able and beautiful Appearance; but for Want of tho&s;e Advantages, was &s;uch a Spectacle, as a Man would blu&s;h to look upon.</P>
<P>I have now, continued my Friend, given you an Account of tho&s;e who were placed on the Right Hand of the Matron, and who, according to the Order in which they &s;at, were <HI>Dei&s;m, Ju|dai&s;m,</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="312">
and <HI>Popery.</HI> On the Left Hand, as I told you, appeared <HI>Presbytery.</HI> The next to her was a Figure which &s;omewhat puzzled me: It was that of a Man looking, with Horror in his Eyes, upon a Silver Ba&s;on filled with Water. Ob&s;erving &s;omething in his Countenance that looked like Lunacy, I fancied at fir&s;t that he was to expre&s;s that kind of Di&s;traction which the Phy&s;icians call the <HI>Hydro-Phobia;</HI> but con&s;idering what the Intention of the Show was, I immediately re|collected my &s;elf, and concluded it to be <HI>Ana|bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The next Figure was a Man that &s;at under a mo&s;t profound Compo&s;ure of Mind: He wore an Hat who&s;e Brims were exactly parallel with the Horizon: His Garment had neither Sleeve nor Skirt, nor &s;o much as a &s;uperfluous Button. What they called his Cravat, was a little Piece of white Linen quilled with great Exactne&s;s, and hanging below his Chin about two Inches. See|ing a Book in his Hand, I asked our Arti&s;t what it was, who told me it was the <HI>Quakers</HI> Religion; upon which I de&s;ired a Sight of it. Upon Peru|&s;al, I found it to be nothing but a new-fa&s;hioned Grammar, or an Art of abridging ordinary Di&s;|cour&s;e. The Nouns were reduced to a very &s;mall Number, as the <HI>Light, Friend, Babylon.</HI> The principal of his Pronouns was <HI>Thou;</HI> and as for You, Ye, and Yours, I found they were not looked upon as Parts of Speech in this Grammar. All the Verbs wanted the Second Per&s;on Plural; the Participles ended all in <HI>ing</HI> or <HI>ed,</HI> which were marked with a particular Accent. There were no Adverbs be&s;ides <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Nay.</HI> The &s;ame Thrift was ob&s;erved in the Prepo&s;itions. The Con|junctions were only <HI>Hem!</HI> and <HI>Ha!</HI> and the In|terjections brought under the Three Heads of Sighing, Sobbing, and Groaning.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="313">
There was at the End of the Grammar a little Nomenclature, call'd, <HI>The Chri&s;tian Man's Voca|bulary,</HI> which gave new Appellations, or (if you will) Chri&s;tian Names to almo&s;t every Thing in Life. I replaced the Book in the Hand of the Fi|gure, not without admiring the Simplicity of its Garb, Speech, and Behaviour.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to this Row of Religions, there was a Statue dre&s;&s;ed in a Fool's Coat, with a Cap of Bells upon his Head, laughing and pointing at the Figures that &s;tood before him. This Ideot is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay in his Heart what <HI>David</HI>'s Fool did &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years ago, and was therefore de&s;igned as a proper Repre&s;entative of tho&s;e among us who are called Athei&s;ts and In|fidels by others, and Free-Thinkers by them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>There were many other Groupes of Figures which I did not know the Meaning of; but &s;ee|ing a Collection of both Sexes turning their Backs upon the Company, and laying their Heads very clo&s;e together, I enquired after their Religion, and found that they called them&s;elves the <HI>Philo|delphians,</HI> or the Family of Love.</P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Corner there &s;at another little Congregation of &s;trange Figures, opening their Mouths as wide as they could gape, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the Title of the <HI>Sweet Singers of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit, that in this A&s;&s;embly of Wax there were &s;everal Pieces that moved by Clock|work, and gave great Satisfaction to the Specta|tors. Behind the Matron there &s;tood one of the&s;e Figures, and behind <HI>Popery</HI> another, which, as the Arti&s;t told us, were each of them the Genius of the Per&s;on they attended. That behind <HI>Popery</HI> repre&s;ented <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> and the other <HI>Moderation.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e moved by &s;ecret Springs to|wards a great Heap of dead Bodies that lay piled upon one another at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance be|hind the principal Figures. There were written
<PB N="304" REF="314">

<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE>
<P>GRatitude obliges me to make this publick Acknowledgment of the eminent Service you have done my &s;elf in particular, and the whole Body of Chaplains (I hope) in general. Coming Home on <HI>Sunday</HI> about Dinner-time, I found Things &s;trangely altered for the better; the Porter &s;miled in my Face when he let me in, the Footman bowed to me as I pa&s;&s;ed him, the Steward &s;hook me by the Hand, and Mrs. <HI>Beatrice</HI> drop'd me a Courte&s;ie as &s;he went along. I was &s;urprized at all this Civility, and knew not to what I might a&s;cribe it, except to my bright Beaver and &s;hining Scarf that were new that Day. But I was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed to find &s;uch an agreeable Change at the Table: My Lord helped me to a fat Slice of Veni&s;on with his own Hand, and my Lady did me the Honour to drink to me. I offered to ri&s;e at my u&s;ual Time, but was de&s;ired to fit &s;till, with this kind Expre&s;&s;ion: Come Doctor, a Gelly or a Con&s;erve will do you no Harm; don't be a|fraid of the De&s;&s;ert. I was &s;o confounded with the Favour, that I returned my Thanks in a mo&s;t aukward Manner, wondering what was the Meaning of this total Transformation: But

<P><HI>ELizabeth Makebate,</HI> of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Cathe|rine</HI>'s, Spin&s;ter, was indicted for &s;urrepti|tiou&s;ly taking away the Ha&s;&s;ock from under the Lady <HI>Grave-Airs,</HI> between the Hours of Four and Five, on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 26th of <HI>November.</HI> The Pro|&s;ecutor depo&s;ed, That as &s;he &s;tood up to make a Courte&s;ie to a Per&s;on of Quality in a neighbour|ing Pew, the Criminal conveyed away the Ha&s;|&s;ock by Stealth, in&s;omuch that the Pro&s;ecutor was obliged to fit all the while &s;he was at Church, or to &s;ay her Prayers in a Po&s;ture that did not become a Woman of her Quality. The

Pri&s;oner pleaded Inadvertency; and the Jury were going to bring it in Chance-medley, had not &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es been produced again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Elizabeth Makebate,</HI> that &s;he was an old Of|fender, and a Woman of a bad Reputation. It appeared in particular, That on the <HI>Sunday</HI> before &s;he had detracted from a new Petticoat of Mrs. <HI>Ma|ry Doelittle,</HI> having &s;aid in the Hearing of &s;everal credible Witne&s;&s;es, that the &s;aid Petticoat was &s;cowred, to the great Grief and Detriment of the &s;aid <HI>Mary Doelittle.</HI> There were likewi&s;e many Evidences produced again&s;t the Criminal, that though &s;he never failed to come to Church on <HI>Sunday,</HI> &s;he was a mo&s;t notorious Sabbath-Brea|ker, and that &s;he &s;pent her whole Time, during Divine Service, in di&s;paraging other People's Clothes, and whi&s;pering to tho&s;e who &s;at next her. Upon the whole, &s;he was found guilty of the Indictment, and received Sentence to ask Pardon of the Pro&s;ecutor upon her bare Knees, without either Cu&s;hion or Ha&s;&s;ock under her, in the Face of the Court.</P>
<P><HI>N.

<P><HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> Linendraper, in the City of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> was indicted for &s;peaking ob&s;cenely to the Lady <HI>Penolope Youthwood.</HI> It appeared, That the Pro&s;ecutor and her Woman going in a
<PB N="311" REF="321">
Stage-Coach from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Brentford,</HI> where they were to be met by the Lady's own Chariot, the Criminal and another of his Acquaintance travelled with them in the &s;ame Coach, at which Time the Pri&s;oner talked Bawdy for the Space of Three Miles and a half. The Pro&s;ecutor alledg|ed, That over again&s;t the <HI>Old Fox</HI> at <HI>Knight&s;|bridge</HI> he mentioned the Word Linen; That at the further End of <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> he made U&s;e of the Term Smock; and that before he came to <HI>Ham|mer&s;mith,</HI> he talked almo&s;t a Quarter of an Hour upon Wedding-Shifts. The Pro&s;ecutor's Woman confirmed what her Lady had &s;aid, and added further, That &s;he had never &s;een her La|dy in &s;o great a Confu&s;ion, and in &s;uch a Ta|king, as &s;he was during the whole Di&s;cour&s;e of the Criminal. The Pri&s;oner had little to &s;ay for him&s;elf, but that he talked only in his own Trade, and meant no Hurt by what he &s;aid. The Jury however found him guilty, and repre&s;ented by their Forewoman, That &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es were apt to &s;ully the Imagination, and that by a Concate|nation of Idea's, the Word Linen implied many Things that were not proper to be &s;tirred up in the Mind of a Woman who was of the Pro&s;ecu|tor's Quality, and therefore gave it as their Ver|dict, That the Linendraper &s;hould lo&s;e his Tongue. Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> &s;aid, he thought the Pro&s;ecutor's Ears were as much to blame as the Pri&s;oner's Tongue, and therefore gave Sentence as follows: That they &s;hould both be placed over-again&s;t one another in the Mid&s;t of the Court, there to re|main for the Space of one Quarter of an Hour, during which Time, the Linendraper was to be gagged, and the Lady to hold her Hands clo&s;e upon both her Ears, which was executed accor|dingly.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Callicoat</HI> was indicted as an Accomplice to <HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> for that he the &s;aid <HI>Edward Callicoat</HI> did, by his Silence and his Smiles, &s;eem
<PB N="312" REF="322">
to approve and abet the &s;aid <HI>Charles Cambrick</HI> in every Thing he &s;aid. It appeared, That the Pri|&s;oner was Foreman of the Shop to the afore&s;aid <HI>Charles Cambrick,</HI> and by his Po&s;t obliged to &s;mile at every Thing that the other &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ay: Upon which he was acquitted.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;ias Shallow</HI> was indicted in the Name of Dame <HI>Winifred,</HI> &s;ole Relict of <HI>Richard Dainty</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for having &s;aid &s;everal Times in Company, and in the Hearing of &s;everal Per&s;ons there pre&s;ent, That he was extremely obliged to the Widow <HI>Dainty,</HI> and that he &s;hould never be able &s;uffi|ciently to expre&s;s his Gratitude. The Pro&s;ecutor urged, That this might blaft her Reputation, and that it was in Effect a boa&s;ting of Favours which he had never received. The Pri&s;oner &s;eemed to be much a&s;toni&s;hed at the Con&s;truction which was put upon his Words, and &s;aid, That he meant nothing by them, but that the Widow had befriended him in a Lea&s;e, and was very kind to his younger Si&s;ter. The Jury finding him a little weak in his Under&s;tanding, without going out of the Court, brought in their Verdict <HI>Igno|ramus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ur&s;ula Goodenough</HI> was accu&s;ed by the Lady <HI>Betty Wou'dbe,</HI> for having &s;aid, That &s;he the Lady <HI>Betty Wou'dbe</HI> was painted. The Pri&s;oner brought &s;everal Per&s;ons of good Credit to witne&s;s to her Reputation, and proved by undeniable Evidences, that &s;he was never at the Place where the Words were &s;aid to have been uttered. The Cen&s;or ob|&s;erving the Behaviour of the Pro&s;ecutor, found Rea&s;on to believe that &s;he had indicted the Pri&s;o|ner for no other Rea&s;on but to make her Com|plexion be taken Notice of, which indeed was very fre&s;h and beautiful: He therefore asked the Offender with a very &s;tern Voice, How &s;he could pre&s;ume to &s;pread &s;o groundle&s;s a Report? And whether &s;he &s;aw any Colours in the Lady <HI>Wou'd|be</HI>'s Face that could procure Credit to &s;uch a

Fal&s;hood?

<P>WE have a very learned and elaborate Di&s;|&s;ertation upon Thumbs in <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s <HI>E&s;|&s;ays,</HI> and another upon Ears in the <HI>Tale of a Tub.</HI> I am here going to write one upon No&s;es, having cho&s;en for my Text the following Ver&s;es out of <HI>Hudibras:</HI></P>

<L>La&s;ted as long as Parent Breech:</L>
<L>But when the Date of Nock was out,</L>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding that there is nothing ob&s;cene in Natural Knowledge, and that I intend to give as little Offence as may be to Readers of a well|bred Imagination, I mu&s;t, for my own Quiet, de|&s;ire the Criticks (who in all Times have been fa|mous for good No&s;es) to refrain from the Lecture of this curious Tract. The&s;e Gentlemen were formerly marked out and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the little Rhinocerical No&s;e, which was always look|ed upon as an In&s;trument of Deri&s;ion, and which they were u&s;ed to cock, to&s;s, or draw up in a contemptuous Manner, upon reading the Works of their ingenious Contemporaries. It is not therefore for this Generation of Men that I write the pre&s;ent Tran&s;action,<Q><L>&mdash; Minus aptus acutis</L>

But for the Sake of &s;ome of my Philo&s;ophical Friends in the Royal Society, who peru&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es of this Nature with a becoming Gravity, and a De&s;ire of improving by them.</P>
<P>Many are the Opinions of learned Men con|cerning the Ri&s;e of that fatal Di&s;temper which has always taken a particular Plea&s;ure in venting its Spight upon the No&s;e. I have &s;een a little Burle&s;que Poem in <HI>Italian</HI> that gives a very plea|&s;ant Account of this Matter. The Fable of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ns thus: <HI>Mars,</HI> the God of War, having &s;erved during the Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> in the Shape of a <HI>French</HI> Colonel, received a Vi&s;it one Night from <HI>Venus,</HI> the Godde&s;s of Love, who had been al|ways his profe&s;&s;ed Mi&s;tre&s;s and Admirer. The
<PB N="315" REF="325">
Poem &s;ays, &s;he came to him in the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Suttling Wench, with a Bottle of Brandy under her Arm. Let that be as it will, he managed Matters &s;o well, that &s;he went away big-bellied, and was at length brought to Bed of a little <HI>Cu|pid.</HI> This Boy, whether it were by Rea&s;on of any bad Food that his Father had eaten during the Siege, or of any particular Malignity in the Stars that reigned at his Nativity, came into the World with a very &s;ickly Look, and crazy Con&s;titution. As &s;oon as he was able to handle his Bow, he made Di&s;coveries of a mo&s;t perver&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition. He dipped all his Arrows in Poi&s;on, that rotted every Thing they touched; and what was more particular, aimed all his Shafts at the No&s;e, quite contrary to the Practice of his elder Brothers, who had made a humane Heart their Burt in all Countries and Ages. To break him of this Ro|gui&s;h Trick, his Parents put him to School to <HI>Mercury,</HI> who did all he could to hinder him from demoli&s;hing the No&s;es of Mankind; but in Spight of Education, the Boy continued very unlucky; and tho' his Malice was a little &s;oftened by good In&s;tructions, he would very frequently let fly an invenomed Arrow, and wound his Votaries oft|ner in the No&s;e than in the Heart. Thus far the Fable.</P>
<P>I need not tell my learned Reader, that <HI>Correg|gio</HI> has drawn a <HI>Cupid</HI> taking his Le&s;&s;on from <HI>Mercury,</HI> conformable to this Poem; nor that the Poem it &s;elf was de&s;igned as a Burle&s;que upon <HI>Fraca&s;torius.</HI></P>
<P>It was a little after this fatal Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> that <HI>Talicotius</HI> begun to practi&s;e in a Town of <HI>Germany.</HI> He was the fir&s;t Clap-Doctor that I meet with in Hi&s;tory, and a greater Man in his Age than our celebrated Dr. <HI>Wall.</HI> He &s;aw his Species extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new Di&s;temper that was crept into it; and therefore, in Pur&s;uance of a very &s;ea&s;onable In|ven|tion,
<PB N="316" REF="326">
&s;et up a Manufacture of No&s;es, havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t got a Patent that none &s;hould pre&s;ume t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> make No&s;es be&s;ides him&s;elf.

There was however one Mi&s;|fortune in this Experiment: The <HI>Portugue&s;e's</HI> Complexion was a little upon the Subfusk, with very black Eyes and dark Eyebrows; and the No&s;e being taken from a Porter that had a white <HI>German</HI> Skin, and cut out of tho&s;e Parts that are not expo&s;ed to the Sun, it was very vi&s;ible that the Features of his Face were not Fellows. In a Word, the <HI>Comd&eacute;</HI> re&s;embled one of tho&s;e maimed antique Statues that has often a modern No&s;e of fre&s;h Marble glewed to a Face of &s;uch a yellow Ivory Complexion as nothing can give but Age. To remedy this Particular for the future, the Doctor got together a great Collection of Porters, Men of all Complexions, black, brown, fair, dark, &s;allow, pale, and ruddy; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a Patient of the mo&s;t out-of-the-way Colour not to find a No&s;e to match it.</P>
<P>The Doctor's Hou&s;e was now very much en|larged, and become a Kind of College, or rather Ho&s;pital, for the fa&s;hionable Cripples of both Sexes that re&s;orted to him from all Parts of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> Over his Door was fa&s;tened a large Golden Snout, not unlike that which is placed over the great Gates at <HI>Brazen-No&s;e</HI> College in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and as it is u&s;ual for the Learned in Foreign Uni|ver&s;ities to di&s;tingui&s;h their Hou&s;es by a <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence, the Doctor writ underneath this great Golden Probo&s;cis Two Ver&s;es out of <HI>Ovid:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="317" REF="327">
<L>Militat omnis Amans, habet &amp; &s;ua Ca&s;tra Cupido,</L>
<L>Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis Amans.</L></Q>
<P>It is reported, That <HI>Talicotius</HI> had at one Time in his Hou&s;e Twelve <HI>German</HI> Counts, Nineteen <HI>French</HI> Marqui&s;&s;es, and a Hundred <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cava|liers, be&s;ides One &s;olitary <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> E&s;quire, of whom more hereafter. Tho' the Doctor had the Monopoly of No&s;es in his own Hands, he is &s;aid not to have been unrea&s;onable. Indeed if a Man had Occa&s;ion for a high <HI>Roman</HI> No&s;e, he mu&s;t go to the Price of it. A Carbuncle No&s;e likewi&s;e bore an exce&s;&s;ive Rate: But for your ordinary &s;hort turned-up No&s;es, of which there was the greate&s;t Con&s;umption, they co&s;t little or nothing; at lea&s;t the Purcha&s;ers thought &s;o, who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them, rather than to have gone without them.</P>
<P>The Sympathy betwixt the No&s;e and its Parent was very extraordinary. <HI>Hudibras</HI> has told us, that when the Porter died, the No&s;e dropped of Cour&s;e, in which Ca&s;e it was always u&s;ual to return the No&s;e, in order to have it interred with its fir&s;t Owner. The No&s;e was likewi&s;e affected by the Pain as well as Death of the Original Proprietor. An eminent In&s;tance of this Nature happen'd to Three <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who&s;e No&s;es were all made out of the &s;ame Piece of Brawn. They found them one Day &s;hoot and &s;well extremely; upon which they &s;ent to know how the Porter did, and heard upon Enquiry, that the Parent of the No&s;es had been &s;everely kicked the Day before, and that the Porter kept his Bed on Account of the Brui&s;es it had received. This was highly re&s;ented by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who found out the Per&s;on that had u&s;ed the Porter &s;o unmercifully, and treated him in the &s;ame Manner as if the Indignity had been done to their own No&s;es. In this and &s;everal o|ther Ca&s;es it might be &s;aid, That the Porters led the Gentlemen by the No&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="328">
On the other Hand, if any Thing went a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> with the No&s;e, the Porter felt the Effects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;omuch that it was generally articled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Patient, that he &s;hould not only ab&s;tain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> his old Cour&s;es, but &s;hould on no Pretence wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+&s;oever &s;mell Pepper, or eat Mu&s;tard; on whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Occa&s;ion, the Part where the Inci&s;ion had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> made was &s;eized with un&s;peakable Twinges a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Prickings.</P>

<P>IT is the Duty of all who make Philo&s;ophy the Entertainment of their Lives, to turn their Thoughts to practical Schemes for the Good of Society, and not pa&s;s away their Time in fruit|le&s;s Searches, which tend rather to the O&s;tenta|tion of Knowledge than the Service of Life.

<P><HI>TImothy Treatall</HI> Gent. was indicated by &s;eve|ral Ladies of his Si&s;ters Acquaintance for a very rude Affront offered to them at an Entertain|ment, to which he had invited them on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 7th of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, between the Hours of Eight and Nine in the Evening. The Indict|ment &s;et forth, That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Treatall,</HI> upon the Serving up of the Supper, de&s;ired the Ladies to take their Places according to their different Age and Seniority, for that it was the Way always at his Table to pay Re&s;pect to Years. The ind ct|ment added, That this produced an un&s;peakable
<PB N="324" REF="334">
Confu&s;ion in the Company; for that the Ladies who before had pre&s;&s;ed together for a Placo at the upper End of the Table, immediately crowded with the &s;ame Di&s;order towards the End that was quite oppo&s;ite; That Mrs. <HI>Frontly</HI> had the In&s;o|leuce to clap her &s;elf down at the very lowe&s;t Place of the Table; That the Widow <HI>Partlett</HI> &s;eated her &s;elf on the Right Hand of Mrs. <HI>Frontly,</HI> alledging for her Excu&s;e, that no Ceremony was to be u&s;ed at a Round Table; That Mrs. <HI>Fidges</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Fe&s;cue</HI> di&s;puted above half an Hour for the &s;ame Chair, and that the latter would not give up the Cau&s;e till it was decided by the Pa|ri&s;h Regi&s;ter, which happened to be kept hard by. The Indictment further &s;aid. That the re&s;t of the Company who &s;at down, did it with a Re&s;erve to their Right, which they were at Liberty to a&s;&s;ert on another Occa&s;ion; and that Mrs. <HI>Mary Pippe,</HI> an old Maid, was placed by the unanimous Vote of the whole Company at the upper End of the Table, from whence &s;he had the Confu&s;ion to be|hold &s;everal Mothers of Families among her In|feriors. The Criminal alledged in his Defence, That what he had done, was to rai&s;e Mirth, and avoid Ceremony, and that the Ladies did not complain of his Rudene&s;s till the next Morning, having eaten up what he had provided for them with great Readine&s;s and Alacrity. The Cen&s;or frowning upon him, told him, That he ought not to di&s;cover &s;o much Levity in Matters of a &s;erious Nature, and (upon the Jury's bringing him in guilty) &s;entenced him to treat the whole A&s;&s;em|bly of Ladies over again, and to take Care that he did it with the Decorum which was due to Per&s;ons of their Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Rebecoa Shapely,</HI> Spin&s;ter, was indicted by Mrs. <HI>Sarah Smack,</HI> for &s;peaking many Words re|&s;iecting upon her Reputation, and the Heels of her Silk Slippers, which the Pri&s;oner had mali|ciou&s;iy &s;ugge&s;ted to be two Inches higher than
<PB N="325" REF="335">
they really were. The Pro&s;ecutor urged, as an Aggravation of her Guilt, That the Pri&s;oner was her &s;elf guilty of the &s;ame Kind of Forgery which &s;he had laid to the Pro&s;ecutor's Charge, for that &s;he the &s;aid <HI>Rebecca Shapely</HI> did always wear a Pair of Steel Bodice, and a fal&s;e Rump. The Cen&s;or ordered the Slippers to be produced in open Court, where the Heels were adjudged to be of the Statutable Size. He then ordered the Grand Jury to &s;earch the Criminal, who, after &s;ome Time &s;pent therein, acquitted her of the Bodice, but found her guilty of the Rump; upon which &s;he received Sentence as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>William Trippit</HI> E&s;quire, of the <HI>Middle-Temple,</HI> brought his Action again&s;t the Lady <HI>Elizabeth Prudely,</HI> for having refu&s;ed him her Hand as he offered to lead her to her Coach from the Opera. The Plaintiff &s;et forth, That he had entred him&s;elf into the Li&s;t of tho&s;e Volunteers who officiate e|very Night behind the Boxes as Gentlemen-U&s;h|ers of the Play-hou&s;e; That he had been at a con|&s;iderable Charge in white Gloves, Periwigs, and Snuff-Boxes, in order to qualify him&s;elf for that Employment, and in Hopes of making his For|tune by it. The Council for the Defendant re|ply'd, That the Plaintiff had given out that he was within a Month of wedding their Client, and that &s;he had refu&s;ed her Hand to him in Ceremony, le&s;t he &s;hould interpret it as a Promi&s;e that &s;he would give it him in Marriage. As &s;oon as their Plead|ings on both Sides were fini&s;hed, the Cen&s;or or|dered the Plaintiff to be ca&s;hier'd from his Office of Gentleman-U&s;her to the Play-hou&s;e, &s;ince it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill De&s;ign; and at the &s;ame Time ordered the Defendant either to marry the &s;aid Plaintiff, or to pay him Half a Crown for the new Pair of Gloves and Coach-hire that he was at the Expence of in her Service.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="336">
The Lady <HI>Townly</HI> brought an Action of Debt a+gain&s;t Mrs. <HI>Flambeau,</HI> for that the &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Flam+beau</HI> had not been to &s;ee the &s;aid Lady <HI>Townly,</HI> and wi&s;h her Joy, &s;ince her Marriage with Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> notwith&s;tanding &s;he the &s;aid Lady <HI>Townly</HI> had paid Mrs. <HI>Flambeau</HI> a Vi&s;it upon her fir&s;t coming to Town. It was urged in the Behalf of the De|fendant, That the Plaintiff had never given her any regular Notice of her being in Town; That the Vi&s;it &s;he alledged had been made on a <HI>Monday,</HI> which &s;he knew was a Day on which Mrs. <HI>Flam|beau</HI> was always abroad, having &s;et a&s;ide that only Day in the Week to mind the Affairs of her Fami|ly; That the Servant who enquired whether &s;he was at Home, did not give the Vi&s;iting-Knock; That it was not between the Hours of Five and Eight in the Evening; That there was no Can|dles lighted up; That it was not on Mrs. <HI>Flam|beau</HI>'s Day; and in &s;hort, That there was not one of the e&s;&s;ential Points ob&s;erved that con&s;titute a Vi&s;it. She further proved by her Porter's Book, which was produced in Court, that &s;he had paid the Lady <HI>Townly</HI> a Vi&s;it on the Twenty fourth Day of <HI>March,</HI> ju&s;t before her leaving the Town, in the Year 1709-10, for which &s;he was &s;till Cre|ditor to the &s;aid Lady <HI>Townly.</HI> To this the Plain|tiff only replied, That &s;he was now under Co|vert, and not liable to any Debts contracted when &s;he was a &s;ingle Woman. Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> finding the Cau&s;e to be very intricate, and that &s;everal Points of Honour were likely to ari&s;e in it, he de|ferred giving Judgment upon it till the next Se&s;&s;ion Day, at which Time he ordered the Ladies on his Left Hand to pre&s;ent to the Court a Table of all the Laws relating to Vi&s;its.</P>
<P><HI>Winifred Lear</HI> brought her Action again&s;t <HI>Ri|chard Sly,</HI> for having broken a Marriage Contract, and wedded another Woman, after he had enga|ged him&s;elf to marry the &s;aid <HI>Winifred Lear.</HI> She alledged, That he had ogled her twice ar an Ope|ra,
<PB N="327" REF="337">
thrice in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church, and once at <HI>Powel</HI>'s Puppet-Show, at which Time he promi|&s;ed her Marriage by a Side-Glance, as her Friend could te&s;tify that &s;at by her. Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> find|ing that the Defendant had made no further Over|ture of Love or Marriage, but by Looks, and Ocu|lar Engagement; yet at the &s;ame Time con&s;ider|ing how very apt &s;uch impudent Seducers are to lead the Ladies Hearts a&s;tray, ordered the Crimi|nal to &s;tand upon the Stage in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> be|tween each Act of the next Opera, there to be expo&s;ed to publick View as a fal&s;e <HI>Ogler.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Ri&s;ing of the Court, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> having taken one of the&s;e Counterfeits in the very Fact as he was ogling a Lady of the Grand Jury, ordered him to be &s;eized, and pro&s;ecuted upon the Statute of Ogling. He likewi&s;e directed the Clerk of the Court to draw up an Edict again&s;t the&s;e common Cheats, that make Women believe they are di&s;tracted for them by &s;taring them out of Countenance, and often bla&s;t a Lady's Reputa|tion whom they never &s;poke to, by &s;aucy Looks and di&s;tant Familiarities.</P>

<P>AN old Friend of mine being lately come to Town, I went to &s;ee him on <HI>Tu&s;day</HI> la&s;t about Eight a Clock in the Evening, with a De&s;ign to &s;it with him an Hour or two, and talk over old Stories; but upon enquiring after him, his Servant told me he was ju&s;t gone to Bed. The next Morn|ing, as &s;oon as I was up and dre&s;&s;ed, and had di&s;|patched
<PB N="328" REF="338">
a little Bu&s;ine&s;s, I came again to my Friend's Hou&s;e about Eleven a Clock, with a De&s;ign to renew my Vi&s;it; but upon asking for him, his Servant told me he was ju&s;t &s;at down to Dinner. In &s;hort, I found that my old fa&s;hioned Friend religiou&s;ly adhered to the Example of his Fore-fathers, and ob&s;erved the &s;ame Hours that had been kept in the Family ever &s;ince the Con|que&s;t.</P>
<P>It is very plain, that the Night was much longer formerly in this I&s;land than it is at pre&s;ent. By the Night, I mean that Portion of Time which Nature has thrown into Darkne&s;s, and which the Wi&s;dom of Mankind had formerly dedicated to Re&s;t and Silence. This u&s;ed to begin at Eight a Clock in the Evening, and conclude at Six in the Morning. The Corfeu, or Eight a Clock Bell, was the Signal throughout the Nation for putting out their Candles and going to Bed.</P>
<P>Our Grandmothers, tho' they were wont to &s;it up the la&s;t in the Family, were all of them fa&s;t a&s;leep at the &s;ame Hours that their Daughters are bu&s;y at Crimp and Ba&s;&s;et. Modern State&s;men are concerting Schemes, and engaged in the Depth of Politicks, at the Time when their Fore-fathers were laid down quietly to Re&s;t, and had nothing in their Heads but Dreams. As we have thus thrown Bu&s;ine&s;s and Plea&s;ure into the Hours of Re&s;t, and by that Means made the natural Night but half as long as it &s;hould be, we are forced to piece it out with a great Part of the Morning; &s;o that near Two thirds of the Nation lie fa&s;t a&s;leep for &s;everal Hours in broad Day-light. This Irre|gularity is grown &s;o very fa&s;hionable at pre&s;ent, that there is &s;carce a Lady of Quality in <HI>Great Britain</HI> that ever &s;aw the Sun ri&s;e. And if the Humour encrea&s;es in Proportion to what it has done of late Years, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but our Children may hear the Bell-Man going about the Streets at Nine a Clock in the Morning, and the
<PB N="329" REF="339">
Watch making their Rounds till Eleven. This unaccountable Di&s;po&s;ition in Mankind to continue awake in the Night, and &s;leep in Sun&s;hine, has made me enquire, Whether the &s;ame Change of Inclination has happened to any other Animals? For this Rea&s;on I de&s;ired a Friend of mine in the Country to let me know, Whether the Lark ri&s;es as early as he did formerly? And whether the Cock begins to crow at his u&s;ual Hour? My Friend has an&s;wered me, That his Poultry are as regular as ever, and that all the Birds and the Bea&s;ts of his Neighbourhood keep the &s;ame Hours that they have ob&s;erved in the Memory of Man; and the &s;ame which, in all Probability, they have kept for the&s;e Five Thou&s;and Years.</P>
<P>If you would &s;ee the Innovations that have been made among us in this Particular, you may only look into the Hours of Colleges, where they &s;till dine at Eleven, and &s;up at Six, which were doubt|le&s;s the Hours of the whole Nation at the Time when tho&s;e Places were founded. But at pre&s;ent the Courts of Ju&s;tice are &s;carce opened in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall</HI> at the Time when <HI>William Rufus</HI> u&s;ed to go to Dinner in it. All Bu&s;ine&s;s is driven forward: The Land Marks of our Fathers (if I may &s;o call them) are removed, and planted fur|ther up into the Day; in&s;omuch that I am afraid our Clergy will be obliged (if they expect full Congregations) not to look any more upon Ten a Clock in the Morning as a Canonical Hour. In my own Memory the Dinner has crept by Degrees from Twelve a Clock to Three, and where it will fix no Body knows.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought to draw up a Memo|rial in the Behalf of Supper again&s;t Dinner, &s;et|ting forth, That the &s;aid Dinner has made &s;everal Encroachments upon the &s;aid Supper, and entered very far upon his Frontiers; That he has bani&s;hed him out of &s;everal Families, and in all has driven him from his Head Quarters, and forced him to

<P><HI>Methu&s;alem</HI> might be half an Hour in telling what a Clock it was; but as for us Po&s;tdiluvians, we ought to do every Thing in Ha&s;t; and in our Speeches, as well as Actions, remember that our Time is &s;hort. A Man that talks for a Quarter of an Hour together in Company, if I meet him frequently, takes up a great Part of my Span.

He drunk a lu&s;ty Draught, &s;at &s;ilent for &s;ome Time, and at la&s;t broke out; I am come (quoth he) to in&s;ult Thee for an old fanta&s;tick Dotard as thou art in ever defending the Wo|men. I have this Evening vi&s;ited Two Widows, who are now in that State I have often heard you call an After-Life: I &s;uppo&s;e you mean by it, an Exi&s;tence which grows out of pa&s;t Enter|tainments, and is an untimely Delight in the Sa|tisfactions which they once &s;et their Hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinqui&s;h. Have but Patience, (continued he) till I give you a &s;uc|cinct Account of my Ladies, and of this Night's Adventure. They are much of an Age, but very different in their Characters: The one of them, with all the Advances which Years have made upon her, goes on in a certain Romantick Road of Love and Friend&s;hip which &s;he fell into in her Teens; the other has transferred the amo|rous Pa&s;&s;ions of her fir&s;t Years to the Love of Cronies, Petts and Favourites, with which &s;he is always &s;urrounded; but the Genius of each of them will be&s;t appear by the Account of what happened to me at their Hou&s;es. About Five this Afternoon, being tired with Study, the Weather inviting, and Time lying a little upon my Hands, I re&s;olved, at the In&s;tigation of my Evil Genius, to vi&s;it them, their Husbands having been our

Contemporaries. This I thought I could do withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> much Trouble, for both live in the very nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Street. I went fir&s;t to my Lady <HI>Camomile,</HI> and the Butler, who had lived long in the Family, and &s;een me often in his Ma&s;ter's Time, u&s;hered me very civilly into the Parlour, and told me, Though my Lady had given &s;trict Orders to be denied, he was &s;ure I might be admitted, and bid the Black-Boy acquaint his Lady, that I was to wait upon her. In the Window lay Two Let|ters, one broke open, the other fre&s;h &s;ealed with a Wafer: The fir&s;t directed to the Divine <HI>Co&s;|melia,</HI> the &s;econd to the Charming <HI>Lucinda;</HI> but both, by the indented Characters, appeared to have been writ by very un&s;teady Hands. Such uncommon Addre&s;&s;es increa&s;ed my Curio&s;ity, and put me upon asking my old Friend the Butler, If he knew who tho&s;e Per&s;ons were? Very well, &s;ays he: This is from Mrs. <HI>Furbi&s;h</HI> to my Lady, an old School-Fellow and great Crony of her La|dy&s;hip's, and this the An&s;wer. I enquired in what Country &s;he lived. Oh dear! &s;ays he, but ju&s;t by in the Neighbourhood. Why, &s;he was here all this Morning, and that Letter came and was an&s;wered within the&s;e Two Hours. They have taken an odd Fancy, you mu&s;t know, to call one another hard Names, but for all that they love one another hugely. By this Time the Boy returned with his Lady's humble Service to me, de&s;iring I would excu&s;e her, for &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee me, nor any Body el&s;e, for it was Opera Night.</P>
<P>Methinks, (&s;ays I) &s;uch innocent Folly as Two old Women's Court&s;hip to each other &s;hould rather make you merry, than put you out of Humour. Peace, good <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> (&s;ays he) no Inter|ruption I be&s;eech you. I got &s;oon to Mrs. <HI>Fee|ble</HI>'s, &s;he that was formerly <HI>Betty Frisk;</HI> you mu&s;t needs remember het, <HI>Tom. Feeble</HI> of <HI>Brazen-No&s;e</HI> fell in Love with her for her fine Dancing.
<PB N="343" REF="353">
Well, Mrs. <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> without further Ceremony, carries me directly up to her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Chamber, where I found her environ'd by Four of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Animals that can ever infe&s;t a Fa|mily: An old Shock Dog with one Eye, a Mon|key chaned to one Side of the Chimney, a great grey Squirrel to the other, and a Parrat wad|dling in the middle of the Room. However, for a while, all was in a profound Tranquillity. Upon the Mantle-Tree, for I am a pretty curious Ob&s;erver, &s;tood a Pot of Lambetive Electuary, with a Stick of Liquori&s;h, and near it a Phyal of Ro&s;e-Water and Powder of Tutty. Upon the Table lay a Pipe filled with Bettony and Colts-Foot, a Roll of Wax-Candle, a Silver Spitting-Pot, and a <HI>Seville</HI> Orange. The Lady was pla|ced in a large Wicker Chair, and her Feet wrap|ped up in Flannel, &s;upported by Cu&s;hions; and in this Attitude (would you believe it <HI>I&s;aac</HI>) was &s;he reading a Romance with Spectacles on. The fir&s;t Compliments over, as &s;he was indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly endeavouring to enter upon Conver&s;ation, a violent Fit of Coughing &s;eized her. This a|wakened Shock, and in a Trice the whole Room was in an Uproar; for the Dog barked, the Squirrel &s;quealed, the Monkey chattered, the Parrat &s;creamed, and <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> to appea&s;e them, was more clamorous than all the re&s;t. You <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who know how any har&s;h Noi&s;e affects my Head, may gue&s;s what I &s;uffered from the hi|deous Din of the&s;e di&s;cordant Sounds. At length all was appea&s;ed, and Quiet re&s;tored: A Chair was drawn for me, where I was no &s;ooner &s;eat|ed, but the Parrat fixed his Horny Beak, as &s;harp as a Pair of Sheers, in one of my Heels, ju&s;t above the Shoe. I &s;prung from the Place with an unu&s;ual Agility, and &s;o being within the Monkey's Reach, he &s;natches off my n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w Bob Wig, and throws it upon Two Apples that were roa&s;ting by a &s;ullen Sea-Coal Fire. I was
<PB N="344" REF="354">
nimble enough to &s;ave it from any further Da|mage than &s;ingeing the Foretop. I put it on, and compo&s;ing my &s;elf as well as I could, I drew my Chair towards the other Side of the Chim|ney. The good Lady, as &s;oon as &s;he had reco|vered Breath, employed it in making a Thou&s;and Apologies, and with great Eloquence, and a nu|merous Train of Words, lamented my Misfor|tune. In the middle of her Harangue, I felt &s;omething &s;cratching near my Knee, and feeling what it &s;hould be, found the Squirrel had got in|to my Coat-Pocket. As I endeavoured to re|move him from his Burrow, he made his Teeth meet through the Fle&s;hy Part of my Fore-Finger. This gave me an unexpre&s;&s;ible Pain. The <HI>Hun|gary</HI> Water was immediately brought to bath it, and Gold-beaters Skin applied to &s;top the Blood. The Lady renewed her Excu&s;es; but being now out of all Patience, I abruptly took my Leave, and hobbling down Stairs with heedle&s;s Ha&s;t, I &s;et my Foot full in a Pail of Water, and down we came to the Bottom together. Here my Friend concluded his Narrative, and, with a compo&s;ed Countenance, I began to make him Compliments of Condoleance; but he &s;tarted from his Chair, and &s;aid, <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> you may &s;pare your Speeches, I expect no Reply: When I told you this, I knew you would laugh at me; but the next Wo|man that makes me ridiculous &s;hall be a young one.</P>

<P>I Have heard, that it is a Rule among the Con|ventuals of &s;everal Orders in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, to &s;hut them&s;elves up at a certain Time of the Year, not only from the World in general, but from the Members of their own Fraternity, and to pa&s;s away &s;everal Days by them&s;elves in &s;ettling Accounts between their Maker and their own Souls, in cancelling unrepented Crimes, and renewing their Contracts of Obedience for the future. Such &s;tated Times for particular Acts of Devotion, or the Exerci&s;e of certain religious Duties, have been enjoined in all civil Govern|ments, whatever Deity they wor&s;hipped, or whatever Religion they profe&s;&s;ed. That which may be done at all Times, is often totally neg|lected and forgotten, unle&s;s fixed and determin|ed to &s;ome Time more than another; and there|fore, though &s;everal Duties may be &s;uitable to every Day of our Lives, they are mo&s;t likely to be performed if &s;ome Days are more particularly &s;et apart for the Practice of them. Our Church has accordingly in&s;tituted &s;everal Sea&s;ons of De|votion, when Time, Cu&s;tom, Pre&s;cription, and (if I may &s;o &s;ay) the Fa&s;hion it &s;elf, call upon a Man to be &s;erious and attentive to the great End of his Being.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="356">
I have hinted in &s;ome former Papers, that the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Men in all Ages and Coun|tries, particularly in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> were re|nowned for their Piety and Virtue. It is now my Intention to &s;how how tho&s;e in our own Na|tion, that have been unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t eminent for Learning and Knowledge, were likewi&s;e the mo&s;t eminent for their Adherence to the Religion of their Country.</P>
<P>I might produce very &s;hining Examples from among the Clergy; but becau&s;e Prie&s;tcraft is the common Cry of every cavelling empty Scribbler, I &s;hall &s;how, that all the Laymen who have ex|erted a more than ordinary Genius in their Wri|tings, and were the Glory of their Times, were Men who&s;e Hopes were filled with Immortality, and the Pro&s;pect of future Rewards, and Men who lived in a dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion to all the Do|ctrines of Revealed Religion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in this Paper only in&s;tance Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> a Man who for the Greatne&s;s of Genius, and Compa&s;s of Knowledge, did Honour to his Age and Country; I could almo&s;t &s;ay to Hu|mane Nature it &s;elf. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once all tho&s;e extraordinary Talents which were divided among&s;t the greate&s;t Authors of Antiquity. He had the &s;ound, di&s;tinct, comprehen&s;ive Know|ledge of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> with all the beautiful Lights, Graces and Embelli&s;hments, of <HI>Cicero.</HI> One does not know which to admire mo&s;t in his Writings, the Strength of Rea&s;on, Force of Style, or Bright|ne&s;s of Imagination.</P>
<P>This Author has remarked in &s;everal Parts of his Works, that a thorough Infight into Phi|lo&s;ophy makes a good Believer, and that a Smat|tering in it naturally produces &s;uch a Race of de&s;picable Infidels as the little profligate Wri|ters of the pre&s;ent Age, whom (I mu&s;t confe&s;s) I have always accu&s;ed to my &s;elf, not &s;o much for their Want of Faith as their Want of Learn|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="357">
I was infinitely plea&s;ed to find among the Works of this extraordinary Man a Prayer of his own compo&s;ing, which, for the Elevation of Thought, and Greatne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems ra|ther the Devotion of an Angel than a Man. His principal Fault &s;eems to have been the Exce&s;s of that Virtue which covers a Multitude of Faults. This betrayed him to &s;o great an Indulgence to|wards his Servants, who made a corrupt U&s;e of it, that it &s;trip'd him of all tho&s;e Riches and Honours which a long Series of Merits had heaped upon him. But in this Prayer, at the &s;ame Time that we find him pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the great Mercy-Seat, and humbled un|der Afflictions which at that Time lay heavy up|on him, we &s;ee him &s;upported by the Sen&s;e of his Integrity, his Zeal, his Devotion, and his Love to Mankind, which give him a much higher Figure in the Minds of Thinking Men, than that Greatne&s;s had done from which he was fallen. I &s;hall beg Leave to write down the Prayer it &s;elf, with the Title to it, as it was found among his Lord&s;hip's Papers, written in his own Hand; not being able to furni&s;h my Reader with an Entertainment more &s;uitable to this &s;olemn Time.</P>
<Q><HI>A Prayer or P&s;alm made by my Lord</HI> Bacon, <HI>Chancellor of</HI> England.
<P>MOST gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; from my Youth up my Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou, O Lord, &s;ounde&s;t and &s;earche&s;t the Depths and Secrets of all Hearts; Thou acknowledge&s;t the Up|right of Heart; Thou judge&s;t the Hypocrite; Thou pondere&s;t Men's Thoughts and Doings as in a Ballance; Thou mea&s;ure&s;t their Intentions as with a Line; Vanity and crooked Ways cannot be hid from Thee.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="358">
Remember, O Lord! how thy Servant hath walked before thee; remember what I have fir&s;t &s;ought, and what hath been principal in my Intentions. I have loved thy A&s;&s;emblies, I have mourned for the Divi&s;ions of thy Church, I have delighted in the Brightne&s;s of thy San|ctuary. This Vine which thy Right Hand hath planted in this Nation, I have ever pray|ed unto Thee that it might have the fir&s;t and the latter Rain, and that it might &s;tretch her Branches to the Seas, and to the Floods. The State and Bread of the Poor and Oppre&s;&s;ed have been precious in mine Eyes; I have hated all Cruelty and Hardne&s;s of Heart; I have (though in a de&s;pi&s;ed Weed) procured the Good of all Men. If any have been my Enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the Sun almo&s;t &s;et upon my Di&s;plea&s;ure; but I have been as a Dove, free from Superfluity of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s. Thy Creatures have been my Books, but thy Scriptures much more. I have &s;ought Thee in the Courts, Fields and Gardens, but I have found Thee in thy Temples.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands have been my Sins, and Ten Thou|&s;ands my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, but thy Sanctifica|tions have remained with me, and my Heart (through thy Grace) hath been an unquenched Coal upon thine Altar.</P>
<P>O Lord, my Strength! I have &s;ince my Youth met with Thee in all my Ways, by thy Fatherly Compa&s;&s;ions, by thy comfortable Cha|&s;ti&s;ements, and by thy mo&s;t vi&s;ible Providence. As thy Favours have increa&s;ed upon me, &s;o have thy Corrections; &s;o as Thou ha&s;t been al|ways near me, O Lord! And ever as my Worldly Ble&s;&s;ings were exalted, &s;o &s;ecret Darts from Thee have pierced me; and when I have a&s;cended before Men, I have de&s;cended in Hu|miliation before Thee. And now when I thought mo&s;t of Peace and Honour, thy Hand
<PB N="349" REF="359">
is heavy upon me, and hath humbled me ac|cording to thy former loving Kindne&s;s, keep|ing me &s;till in thy Fatherly School, not as a Ba|&s;tard, but as a Child. Ju&s;t are thy Judgments upon me for my Sins, which are more in Num|ber than the Sands of the Sea, but have no Pro|portion to thy Mercies; for what are the Sands of the Sea? Earth, Heavens, and all the&s;e, are nothing to thy Mercies. Be&s;ides my innu|merable Sins, I confe&s;s before Thee, that I am Debtor to Thee for the gracious Talent of thy Gifts and Graces, which I have neither put into a Napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to Ex|changers, where it might have made be&s;t Pro|fit, but mi&s;pent it in Things for which I was lea&s;t fit: So I may truly &s;ay, my Soul hath been a Stranger in the Cour&s;e of my Pilgri|mage. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour's Sake, and receive me unto thy Bo&s;om, or guide me in thy Ways.</P></Q>

<P>WE the Cu&s;tomers of this Coffee-hou&s;e, ob&s;erving that you have taken into your Con&s;ideration the great Mi&s;chiefs daily done in this City by Coffee-hou&s;e Orators, do humbly beg Leave to repre&s;ent to you, That this Coffee-hou&s;e being provided with a Pulpit for the Benefit of &s;uch Auctions that are fre|quently made in this Place, it is our Cu&s;tom, upon the fir&s;t coming in of the News, to order a Youth, who officiates as the Kidney of the Coffee-hou&s;e, to get into the Pulpit, and read every Paper with a loud and di&s;tinct Voice, while the whole Audience are &s;ipping their re&s;pective Liquors. We do therefore, Sir, hum|bly propo&s;e, that there be a Pulpit erected within every Coffee-hou&s;e of this City and the adjacent Parts; That one of the Waiters of the Coffee-hou&s;e be nominated as Reader to the &s;aid Pulpit; That after the News of the Day has been publi&s;hed by the &s;aid Lecturer, &s;ome Politician of good Note do a&s;cend into the &s;aid Pulpit; and after having cho&s;en for his Text any Article of the &s;aid News, that he do e&s;tabli&s;h the Authority of &s;uch Article, clear the Doubts that may ari&s;e thereupon, compare it with Parellel Texts in other Papers, advance upon it whole&s;ome Points of Doctrine, and draw from it &s;alutary Conclu&s;ions for the Be|nefit and Edification of all that hear him. We do likewi&s;e humbly propo&s;e, That upon any &s;uch Politician's quitting the Pulpit, he &s;hall be &s;ucceeded by any other Orator that finds him&s;elf moved by the &s;ame publick Spirit, who &s;hall be at full Liberty either to enforce or
<PB N="351" REF="361">
overthrow what the other has &s;aid before him, and may in the &s;ame Manner be &s;ucceeded by any other Politician, who &s;hall with the &s;ame Liberty confirm or impugn his Rea&s;ons, &s;treng|then or invalidate his Conjectures, enlarge upon his Schemes, or erect new ones of his own. We do likewi&s;e further propo&s;e, That if any Per&s;on, of what Age or Rank &s;oever, do pre|&s;ume to cavil at any Paper that has been read, or to hold forth upon it longer than the Space of one Minute, that he be immediately ordered up into the Pulpit, there to make good any Thing that he has &s;ugge&s;ted upon the Floor. We do likewi&s;e further propo&s;e, That if any one plays the Orator in the ordinary Coffee-hou&s;e Conver&s;ation, whether it be upon Peace or War, on Plays or Sermons, Bu&s;ine&s;s or Poetry, that he be forth with de&s;ired to take his Place in the Pulpit.</P>
<P>This, Sir, we humbly pre&s;ume may in a great Mea&s;ure put a Stop to tho&s;e &s;uperficial State&s;men who would not dare to &s;tand up in this Manner before a whole Congregation of Politicians, not|with&s;tanding the long and tedious Harangues and Di&s;&s;ertations which they daily utter in pri|vate Circles, to the breaking of many hone&s;t Trade&s;men, the &s;educing of &s;everal eminent Citizens, the making of numberle&s;s Malecon|tents, and to the great Detriment and Di&s;quiet of Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects.</P>

<P><HI>Epictetus,</HI> in his little Sy&s;tem of Morality, pre|&s;cribes the following Rule with that beautiful Simplicity which &s;hines through all his Precepts. <HI>Beware that thou never tell thy Dreams in Compa|ny; for notwith&s;tanding thou may'&s;t take a Plea&s;ure in Telling thy Dreams, the Company will take no Plea&s;ure in Hearing them.</HI></P>
<P>This Rule is conformable to a Maxim which I have laid down in a late Paper, and mu&s;t always inculcate into tho&s;e of my Readers who find in them&s;elves an Inclination to be very talkative and impertinent, That they &s;hould not &s;peak to plea&s;e them&s;elves, but tho&s;e that hear them.</P>

<P>I Now take Leave to addre&s;s you in your Cha|racter of Cen&s;or, and complain to you, That among the various Errors in Conver&s;ation which you have corrected, there is one which, tho' it has not e&s;cap'd a general Reproof, yet &s;eems to de&s;erve a more particular Severity. 'Tis an Hu|mour of je&s;ting on di&s;agreeable Subjects, and in|&s;i&s;ting on the Je&s;t, the more it creates Unea&s;i|ne&s;s; and this &s;ome Men think they have a Ti|tle to do as Friends. Is the De&s;ign of Je&s;ting to provoke? Or does Friend&s;hip give a Privilege to &s;ay Things with a De&s;ign to &s;hock? How can that be call'd a Je&s;t, which has nothing in it but Bitterne&s;s? 'Tis generally allow'd nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="357" REF="367">
for the Peace of Company, that Men &s;hould a little &s;tudy the Tempers of each others; but cer|tainly that mu&s;t be in order to &s;hun what's of|fen&s;ive, not to make it a con&s;tant Entertain|ment. The frequent Repetition of what appears har&s;h, will unavoidably leave a Rancour that's fatal to Friend&s;hip; and I doubt much, whether it would be an Argument of a Man's good Hu|mour, if he &s;hould be rouzed by perpetual Tea|zing, to treat tho&s;e that do it as his Enemies. In a Word, whereas 'tis a common Practice to let a Story die, meerly becau&s;e it does not touch, I think &s;uch as mention one they find does, are as trouble&s;ome to Society, and as unfit for it, as <HI>Wags, Men of Fire, good Talkers,</HI> or any other Apes in Conver&s;ation; and therefore, for the publick Benefit, I hope you'll cau&s;e them to be branded with &s;uch a Name as they de&s;erve.

<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Ebenozer</HI> is a very common one, and is always cured by Neglect.

<P>That the &s;aid U&s;e and Cu&s;tom has been Two Ways very prejudicial to your Petitioners: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in that it has induced Men, to the great Damage of your Petitioners, to wear their Hats upon their Heads, by which Means the &s;aid Hats la&s;t much longer whole than they would do if worn under their Arms. <HI>Secondly,</HI> in that very often a new Dre&s;&s;ing and a new Lace &s;upply the Place of a new Hat, which Grievance we are chiefly &s;en&s;ible of in the Spring-time, when the Com|pany is leaving the Town; it &s;o happening commonly, that a Hat &s;hall frequent all Winter the fine&s;t and be&s;t A&s;&s;emblies without any Or|naments at all, and in <HI>May</HI> &s;hall be tricked up with Gold or Silver to keep Company with Ru|&s;ticks, and ride in the Rain.</P>

<P>After all that can be thought on the&s;e Subjects, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, That the Men who dre&s;s with a certain Ambition to appear more than they are, are much more excu&s;able than tho&s;e who betray, in the ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing their Per&s;ons, a &s;ecret Vanity and Inclination to &s;hine in Things, wherein if they did &s;ucceed, it would rather le&s;&s;en than advance their Character. For this Rea&s;on I am more provoked at the Allegations relating to the Clergyman, than any other hinted at in the&s;e Complaints.

<P>THE Printer having informed me, That there are as many of the&s;e Papers printed as will make Four Volumes, I am now come to the End of my Ambition in this Matter, and have no|thing further to &s;ay to the World, under the Cha|racter of <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff.</HI> This Work has indeed for &s;ome Time been di&s;agreeable to me, and the Purpo&s;e of it wholly lo&s;t by my being &s;o long un|der&s;tood as the Author. I never de&s;igned in it to give any Man any &s;ecret Wound by my Conceal|ment, but &s;poke in the Character of an old Man, a Philo&s;opher, an Humori&s;t, an A&s;trologer, and a Cen&s;or, to allure my Reader with the Variety of my Subjects, and in&s;inuate, if I could, the Weight of Rea&s;on with the Agreeablene&s;s of Wit. The general Purpo&s;e of the whole has been to recommend Truth, Innocence, Honour, and Virtue, as the chief Ornaments of Life; but I con&s;idered, that Severity of Manners was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to him who would cen&s;ure others, and for that Rea&s;on, and that only, cho&s;e to talk in a Mask.

<P>As to the Work it &s;elf, the Acceptance it has met with is the be&s;t Proof of its Value; but I &s;hould err again&s;t that Candour which an hone&s;t Man &s;hould always carry about him, if I did not own, that the mo&s;t approved Pieces in it were written by others, and tho&s;e which have been mo&s;t excepted again&s;t by my &s;elf. The Hand that has a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in tho&s;e noble Di&s;cour&s;es up|on the Immortality of the Soul, the glorious Pro|&s;pects of another Life, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime Idea's of Religion and Virtue, is a Per&s;on who is too fondly my Friend ever to own them; but I &s;hould little de&s;erve to be his, if I u&s;urped the Glory of them. I mu&s;t acknowledge at the &s;ame Time, that I think the fine&s;t Strokes of Wit and Humour in all Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI>'s Lucubra|tions are tho&s;e for which he is al&s;o beholden to him.</P>
<P>As for the Satyrical Parts of the&s;e Writings, tho&s;e again&s;t the Gentlemen who profe&s;s Gaming are the mo&s;t licentious; but the main of them I take to come from lo&s;ing Game&s;ters, as Invectives again&s;t the Fortunate; for in very many of them, I was very little el&s;e but the Tran&s;criber. If any have been more particularly marked at, &s;uch Per&s;ons may impute it to their own Behaviour, (before they were touched upon) in publickly &s;peaking their Re&s;entment again&s;t the Author, and profe&s;&s;ing they would &s;upport any Man who &s;hould in&s;ult him. When I mention this Sub|ject, I hope Major-General <HI>Davenport,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Bi&s;&s;et,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Forbes,</HI> will accept of my Thanks for their frequent good Offices, in pro|fe&s;&s;ing their Readine&s;s to partake any Danger
<PB N="366" REF="376">
that &s;hould befal me in &s;o ju&s;t an Undertaking as the Endeavour to bani&s;h Fraud and Couze|nage from the Pre&s;ence and Conver&s;ation of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>But what I find is the lea&s;t excu&s;able Part of all this Work is, That I have, in &s;ome Places in it, touched upon Matters which concern both the Church and State. All I &s;hall &s;ay for this is, That the Points I alluded to are &s;uch as concern|ed every Chri&s;tian and Freeholder in <HI>England;</HI> and I could not be cold enough to conceal my Opinion on Subjects which related to either of tho&s;e Characters. But Politicks apart. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it has been a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure to me to frame Characters of Dome&s;tick Life, and put tho&s;e Parts of it which are lea&s;t ob&s;erved in|to an agreeable View; to enquire into the Seeds of Vanity and Affectation, to lay before my Rea|ders the Emptine&s;s of Ambition: In a Word, to trace Humane Life through all its Mazes and Rece&s;&s;es, and &s;how much &s;horter Methods than Men ordinarily practi&s;e, to be happy, agreeable, and great.</P>
<P>But to enquire into Men's Faults and Weak|ne&s;&s;es has &s;omething in it &s;o unwelcome, that I have often &s;een People in Pain to act before me, who&s;e Mode&s;ty only make them think them|&s;elves liable to Cen&s;ure. This, and a Thou&s;and other namele&s;s Things, have made it an irk&s;ome Task to me to per&s;onate Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> any lon|ger; and I believe it does not often happen, that the Reader is delighted where the Author is di&s;|plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>All I can now do for the further Gratification of the Town, is to give them a faithful Index and Explication of Pa&s;&s;ages and Allu&s;ions, and &s;ometimes of Per&s;ons intended in the &s;everal &s;cattered Parts of the Work. At the &s;ame Time, the &s;ucceeding Volumes &s;hall di&s;cover which of the whole have been written by me, and which
<PB N="367" REF="377">
by others, and by whom, as far as I am able, or permitted.</P>
<P>Thus I have voluntarily done what I think all Authors &s;hould do when call'd upon. I have publi&s;hed my Name to my Writings, and given my &s;elf up to the Mercy of the Town (as <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) with all my Imperfections on my Head. The indulgent Readers</P>
