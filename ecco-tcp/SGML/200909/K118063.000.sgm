<P>THE CELEBRATED LECTURE ON HEADS.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN a culprit is arraigned at the bar, he holds up his hand, &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to providence, and the laws of his country; both my hands I hold up, not arrogantly to provoke my trial, but merely as a peti|tioner for a patient hearing.</P>
<P>By all the laws of laughing, every man has an undoubted right to play the fool with him&s;elf; under that licen&s;e this exhibition is attempted.&mdash;Good wine needs no bu&s;h;&mdash;the bad de&s;erves none: if what I have to offer meets with your approbation, you will ap|plaud it; if otherwi&s;e, it will meet with the contempt it de&s;erves. &mdash;Some of the&s;e heads are manufactured in wood, and others in pa&s;teboard, to denote that there are not only Blockheads, but Paper Sculls.</P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e extraordinary per&s;onages called Conquerors. He was called Alexander the Great, from the great number of people his ambition had cut to pieces; he was a mo&s;t dexterous &s;laughterman, and thought mankind only made for him to cut away with; he was a great hero, warrior, and man-killer.&mdash;For|merly. And&mdash;This is the head of a Cherokee Chief, called Sachem-Swampum-Scalpo Tomahauk;&mdash;He was a great hero, warrior, and man-killer&mdash;Lately. And</P>
<P>This is the head of a quack-doctor;&mdash;a greater man-killer than either of the other two. This head of the quack doctor is exhibited to &s;hew the weakne&s;s of wi&s;dom, and the &s;trength of folly; for if wi&s;dom was not very weak, would &s;uch fellows as
<PB N="2" REF="4">Carmen, Coblers, and Porters, be permitted to vend their un|whole&s;ome mixtures, under letters patent;&mdash;and if folly was not too &s;trong, would any body &s;wallow their compo&s;itions!&mdash;The madne&s;s of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander.</NOTE> this head, made him a conqueror.&mdash;The folly of the town dubb'd<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Quack-doctor.</NOTE> this a doctor.&mdash;The exploits of Alexander are celebrated by half the great writers of the age; and yet this Alex|ander was nothing more than a murderer and a madman; who ran from one end of the world to the other, &s;eeking whom he might cut to pieces;&mdash;and<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cherokee Chief.</NOTE> this copper-complexioned hero wants no|thing to make him as great as Alexander, but the ru&s;t of antiquity to varni&s;h over his crimes, and the pens of writers to illu&s;trate his actions.&mdash;The Quack-doctor is his own hi&s;torian; and publi&s;hes, in the Daily Adverti&s;er and Gazetteer, accounts of cures never performed, and copies of affidavits never &s;worn to.</P>
<P>Here is the quack-doctor's coat of arms; three ducks proper, and Quack, Quack, Quack, for the motto.&mdash;'Tis charged round with death's heads; and by way of cre&s;t, a number of quack puffs, and bills of mortality.&mdash;It was made up for him by the wor&s;hipful company of Undertakers, and pre&s;ented to him by the Sextons and Gravediggers; to denote, that the&s;e people look upon Quack-doctors as their greate&s;t benefactors.</P>
<P>The ornaments of<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The head of a Cuckold.</NOTE> this head, are not for what the wearer has done; on the contrary, he bears about him the con&s;tant memo|rial of the faults of others, and is by the ill-judging part of the world, condemned for crimes he could not commit, and the very commi&s;&s;ion of which con&s;titute all his unhappine&s;s. The&s;e horns, like the cornucopia of the antients, &s;ignify plenty; and denote, that this head hath abundance of brethren in affliction; they are gilt to &s;hew, that there are wretches ba&s;e enough to accept the wages of di&s;honour, even in a point the mo&s;t delicate.&mdash;This bra&s;s Buck's-head, we all well know, is made u&s;e of both in public and private hou&s;es; nor had it been made in this &s;hape, but to accu&s;|tom mankind not only to the &s;ight of horns, but to the u&s;e of hanging their hats upon them.</P>
<P>From the ancient cu&s;tom of adorning the temple, came the modern cu&s;tom of embelli&s;hing the whole head. Hence aro&s;e the wig manufactory&mdash;the con&s;equence of which we &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">A Coun&s;ellor's head.</NOTE>Here is a head, and only a head; a plain, &s;imple, naked, un|imbelli&s;hed appearance; which, in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, conveys to us no other idea, than that of a brui&s;er, preparing to fight at Broughton's. Behold how naked, how &s;imple a thing Nature is! But, behold, how luxuriant is<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">A large tye wig upon the head.</NOTE> Art! What importance is now &s;eated on the&s;e brows! What reverence the features demand!
<PB N="3" REF="5">What dignity is diffu&s;ed on the whole countenance!&mdash;This is a compendium of the law&mdash;Special pleadings in the fore-top; pleas, rejoinders, replications, and demurs, in each turn of the head&mdash;the knotty points of practice in the twi&s;t of the tail&mdash; the depth of the full bottom, denotes the length of a chancery &s;uit, while the black coif at top, like a bli&s;ter plai&s;ter, &s;eems to tell us, that the Law is a great irritator, and never to be u&s;ed but in very de&s;perate ca&s;es.&mdash;But as it is not enough to &s;uppo&s;e a re&s;emblance, and as we have more blocks than one to try our wigs upon, we will make an exchange, and attempt an oration in prai&s;e of the law.</P>
<P>Law! law! law! is like a fine woman's temper&mdash;a very diffi|cult &s;tudy.&mdash;Law! law; is like a book of &s;urgery;&mdash;a great many terrible ca&s;es in it.&mdash;Law; it is like fire and water; very good &s;ervants; but very bad when they get the upper hand of us; &mdash;'tis like a homely genteel woman, very well to follow;&mdash;'tis al&s;o, like a &s;colding wife, very bad when it follows us;&mdash;and again, it is like bad weather, mo&s;t people chu&s;e to keep out of it. &mdash;In law! In law there are four parts; the Quid libet, the Quod libet, the Quid pro quo, and the Sine qua non.&mdash;Imprimis; the Quid libet; or who began fir&s;t? becau&s;e, in all actions of a&s;&s;ault, the law is clear, that primus &s;trokus, is ab&s;olutus malus, &s;ine jokus; which, being elegantly and cla&s;&s;ically rendered into Engli&s;h, is, that, who&s;oever he be that gave the fir&s;t &s;troke, it was ab&s;olute ill, and without a joke.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Quod libet, or the damages; but that the law has nothing to do with, only to &s;tate them; for whatever da|mages en&s;ue, they are all the client's perqui&s;ites, according to that ancient Norman motto;&mdash;If he is ca&s;t, or ca&s;tandum; he is &s;emper idem, ruinandum.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Quid pro quo; feeing council.&mdash;Giving words for money, or having money for words; according to that ancient Norman motto, "Si curat lex,"&mdash;We live to perplex.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Sina qua non; or, without &s;omething, what would any thing be good for? Without this wig, what would the out|lines of the law be good for?</P>
<P>I &s;hall illu&s;trate this by a ca&s;e in point (Peere Williams, p. 96) Daniel again&s;t Di&s;hclout&mdash; Plaintiff Daniel was groom in the &s;ame family where defendant Di&s;hclout was cook. Plaintiff Daniel had been drinking, or, as Dr. Bibbibus has it in his di&s;&s;ertation on bumpers, he was Homo Duplicans, that is, he was a double man; he was not as he &s;hould be, ip&s;e he; but as he &s;hould not be, tip&s;e he &mdash; Plaintiff Daniel made a forcible entry on the cook's premi&s;&s;es, the kitchen.&mdash;Now, the kitchen, according to Serjeant Plodding, as he has it in his 149th vol. folio, of the abridgement of the &s;tatures, page 1296, there he &s;ays, that the kitchen is, Ca|mera nece&s;&s;aria, in u&s;u cookeraro, where &s;he has the overlooking, the conduct, the management, the &s;upervi&s;ing, the feeing to, the &s;uperintendance, and the &s;peculation, of all the &s;au&s;pannis, &s;lew|pannis,
<PB N="4" REF="6">frienpannis, et &s;tovis, &s;moke jacko, and where our cook was at this time employed in all the duties of her office; where &s;he was roa&s;tandum, boilandum, fyrandum, friga&s;eyandum, et plumb pludding magnum, mixandum. At this time Plaintiff Da|niel made a forcible entry, &amp;c. and demanded a &s;op in the pan; defendant Di&s;hclout in&s;i&s;ted on her right of refu&s;al;&mdash;(a &s;op in the pan, gemmen is a very &s;erious thing) and without perqui&s;ites, what are all honours and places good for? Nothing more than an embroidered button hole; and if we con&s;ider a mini&s;ter of &s;tate as the nation's cook, then perqui&s;ites are the &s;op in the pan to the mini&s;ter of &s;tate, with which omnium gatherum choo&s;e to grea&s;e their fingers.&mdash;Well, Plaintiff Daniel demanded a &s;op in the pan; Defendant Di&s;hclout in&s;i&s;ted on a right of refu&s;al; Daniel &s;eized Di&s;hclout by the left hand, there was the Quid libet, or the a&s;&s;ault<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Di&s;hclout took Daniel by the right hand, and pulled him into the dripping pan; there was the damages&mdash;the dripping pan &mdash;Now, if the dripping-pan had not been there, he could not have fallen into the dripping pan; and if he had not been there, the dripping pan could not have received him. And this is law; and the loquaciou&s;ne&s;s of the law is multi loquacious; fora&s;|much, neverthele&s;s, likewi&s;e, moreover, and al&s;o.&mdash;The liberty of the Law is the happine&s;s of the Engli&s;h; and it is very happy for us Engli&s;hmen, that we have the liberty to go to law.</P>
<P>Here is a wig, as &s;tiff as if chi&s;&s;eled out of a &s;tone by a cutter; and as unnatural as Chine&s;e ornaments; and yet the&s;e wigs, and the wearers of them too, are in fa&s;hion in &s;ome parts of the town; and thus plai&s;tered, like the top of a cabbage plant after a &s;hower of &s;now, 'tis called the Journeyman's Jemmy. And</P>
<P>This is Sir Langui&s;h Li&s;py, the&s;e creatures adorn the out&s;ide of their heads to attack ladies hearts, and they are promoted to places in he &s;ervice of the ladies, in proportion to their re&s;pective merits; they are tea-cup carriers, fan bearers, and &s;nuff box hold|ers. This is the He at the one end of the down, and this is the He at the other end of the town. It would perhaps give pain to any one of this audience, to have &s;uch a pomatum cake pa&s;ted to their heads; but the extreme delicate creatures the&s;e repre&s;ent, &s;el|dom make any other u&s;e of their heads, than to have their hair or wigs dre&s;&s;ed upon them. They &s;mile, and &s;imper, they ogle, they admire every lady, and every lady alike. Nay, they copy the manners of the ladies &s;o clo&s;ely, that grammarians are at a lo&s;s, whe|ther to rank them with the ma&s;culine or feminine, and therefore put them down as the Doubtful Gender.&mdash;The&s;e wigs, from the quantity of powder that is lavi&s;hed upon them, are called Ammu|nition caxons; and thus &s;weetened over, like the &s;ugar at the top of a twelf cake, may &s;eem to denote that the wearers mu&s;t needs be very &s;weet fellows.</P>
<P>Here, is a full frizzel bob.&mdash;The wearer of this wig looks like an o&s;trich in a fright; as if he had run his head into a bu&s;h, and
<PB N="5" REF="7">brought it away with him about his ars.&mdash;Wigs may be con&s;idered as bearing great analogy to books: this, then will be an huge quarto in large paper; as this is a duodecimo in &s;mall print, and belongs to Mr. Donefir&s;t, the long odds-layer: and here is his man, "Cro&s;s and jo&s;tle in," &s;weated down to ride a &s;weep&s;takes; and thus dre&s;&s;ed, in true turf ta&s;te, they are called a brace of "knowing ones"&mdash;The head of a hor&s;e jockey, and a jockey's hor&s;e, may be &s;aid to have great affinity: becau&s;e the jockey's head can pull the hor&s;e's head on which &s;ide the po&s;t he plea&s;es; but what &s;ort of heads mu&s;t tho&s;e people have, who know the&s;e things are done, and yet tru&s;t their capitals with &s;uch &s;inking funds! but we &s;hall forbear to &s;ay any more on this head, for fear of offending tho&s;e high per&s;onages who choo&s;e to re&s;emble grooms and hor&s;e jockeys.&mdash;A conver&s;ation &s;hould have been formed for the&s;e heads, and they &s;hould have talked on various &s;ubjects; &s;uch as politicks, religion, and cold cream; eau de luce, lavender water, demyreps, and French chicken gloves. But as all that has been &s;aid is to no purpo&s;e, and as lea&s;t &s;aid is &s;oone&s;t mended; and as tho&s;e that &s;ay nothing cannot be blamed for &s;peaking, we have cho&s;en to exhibit the&s;e Capitals as mutes; and hope the audience won't take offence at it.&mdash;Some heads are mute, becau&s;e they have nothing to &s;ay: &s;ome, &s;hould be mute, becau&s;e they &s;ay nothing to the purpo&s;e; &s;ome men &s;ay nothing at all to their wives; and &s;ome married men would be extremely happy if their wives &s;aid nothing at all to them.</P>
<P>This is Nobody's head, or the head of Nobody; becau&s;e thus adorned with the fool's cap, nobody chu&s;es to own it.&mdash;Hi&s;torians have left us in the dark, with re&s;pect to the&s;e long ear'd bonnets; but it is, however, &s;uppo&s;ed, that the fir&s;t who wore them was, Judge Midas, who had the inimitable art of turning every thing he touched into gold; and now touch &s;ome people with gold, and you may make any thing of them; money getting, con&s;i&s;ting in the art of making fools; or, of properly &s;uffering our&s;elves to be made fools of.</P>
<P>Life is &s;aid to be a lottery; and Folly concerned in the chances.&mdash; Now let us &s;ee if this fool's cap has any prizes!&mdash;This may appear as a &s;atyr again&s;t card playing, but 'tis not a ju&s;t one; on the con|trary, mo&s;t card players are &s;aid to belong to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Four knaves held up.</NOTE> this family, and generally bear their name; they are called court cards, becau&s;e, when turned up trumps, they become honours.&mdash;Which &s;hews, if you deal fairly you may gain honours, and that, often, honours or no honours, depend entirely on a &s;huffle.</P>
<P>This cre&s;t belongs to tho&s;e ea&s;y kind of mortals, who are &s;aid to be nobody's enemy but their own. They are divided into three cla&s;&s;es; there are your generous fellows,&mdash;your hone&s;t fellows,&mdash; and your devili&s;h clever &s;ellows.&mdash;As to your generous fellow; he is treat ma&s;ter; you hone&s;t fellow, he is toa&s;t ma&s;ter; you devili&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="8">clever fellow, he is &s;inging ma&s;ter, who is to keep the company alive for four or five hours; and then, your devili&s;h hone&s;t fel|low, is to drink them all dead.&mdash;They married into Folly's family, and got this cre&s;t&mdash;"the fool's cap."&mdash;And which to this day nobody chu&s;es to be known by.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k why we &s;o frequently u&s;e the term nothing, let this &s;erve as a rea&s;on; from ten to twenty we go to &s;chool to learn, what, from twenty to thirty, we are &s;trangely apt to forget; from thirty to forty, we think things mu&s;t needs be as we would have them; from forty to fifty, we find our&s;elves a little out in our reck|oning; and, from fifty to &s;ixty, upon ca&s;ting up life's debtor and creditor, we find<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A board held up with a parcel of noughts.</NOTE> this the certain ballance.&mdash;The&s;e are a number of nothings, which, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, have no power or con|&s;equence; yet, by the addition of one, they take rank and prece|dence immediately; which &s;hews, that in life, as well as arithmetic, nothing may be turned into &s;omething by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any one lord of a golden manor; take away the one and they are nothing again.&mdash;To nothing we mu&s;t all come; happy they, who, amid&s;t the variations of nothing, have done nothing to be a&s;hamed of. If they have nothing to fear, they have every thing to hope.&mdash;Thus, ends the di&s;&s;ertation on nothing, which the exhibitor hopes he has properly executed&mdash;by making nothing of it.</P>
<P>From the di&s;&s;ertation on nothing, we come to Nobody's gene|alogical tables.&mdash;This is nobody's cre&s;t, becau&s;e, whoever this may &s;uit, nobody cares to own it.&mdash;This is &s;omebody's cre&s;t; "a &s;creen," becau&s;e in all political di&s;putes, &s;omebody is &s;uppo&s;ed to be behind the &s;creen.&mdash;This coat of legs and arms belongs to tho&s;e ea&s;y kind of mortals, who are always throwing their legs and arms about 'em; re&s;tle&s;s every where; at home; no where: how they live, nobody knows; and how they die, nobody cares. However in|&s;ignificant this may appear, yet that is of no &s;mall importance; for the moment a man begins to fancy him&s;elf &s;omething, he a&s;&s;umes a big look; we have therefore given him a big belly, with a va&s;t corporation; as for the ab&s;ent members, let them be thus made out; let the mayor be the head; the two &s;heriffs, the arms, as they execute the law; the aldermen the legs, as they &s;upport the chair; and, as to the eyes, no&s;e, mouth, &amp;c. why, let them be compo&s;ed of a committee of common councilmen; and &s;o the corporation is made out.</P>
<P>This is any body's coat of arms; the &s;hield is blank, a blank for the cre&s;t! it being as ea&s;y now-a-days, to buy a coat of arms, as any other coat.&mdash;The Herald's office is the true Monmouth-&s;treet in the pari&s;h of Pedigree. It is Honour's piece broker's &s;hop, where every remnant of reputation is to be purcha&s;ed. It &s;hould &s;eem as if the Herald's office had the virtue of Medea's kettle, where every plebeian vulgarity is boiled away, and out they come &s;pick and &s;pan new gentlefolks.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">This is every body's coat of arms;&mdash;a bag of money, and hands catching at it; money reaping being mankind's univer&s;al harve&s;t work: we have given a death's head to every body's coat of arms; being the exact likene&s;s of every body drawn after the life.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange that we &s;hould exhibit &s;uch terms, as e&s;teem, genero&s;ity, friend&s;hip, gratitude, public &s;pirit, and common &s;en&s;e; as belonging to nobody's family: but the truth is, that the&s;e fine qualifications have been &s;o ill u&s;ed, that nobody cared to own them. The con&s;equence of which was, that they were ordered into the workhou&s;e: but the pari&s;h officers unanimou&s;ly agreed, that they &s;hould have no admittance there. Mr. Over&s;eer &s;tanding up, and &s;aying, that as how,&mdash;in the fir&s;t place; imprimis; fir&s;t of all, and foremo&s;t&mdash;Gemmen of the we&s;try, Why what bu&s;ine&s;s have we with friend&s;hip! I take it, that as how the be&s;t friend a man has, is a man's own money in a man's own pocket: and friend&s;hip is nothing more or le&s;s, as I take it, in the whole ver&s;al world, but to borrow a man's money out of a man's pocket. I come now to your grati|tudes; and I take your gratitudes to be a &s;ort of a foreign lingo, which we Engli&s;h folk have nothing at all to do with; to be &s;ure there was &s;uch a per&s;on, when Do-as-you-would-be-done-by was member of parliament. And ye know, gemmen of the we&s;try, &s;ince Self Intere&s;t was made receiver general, Gratitude has been turned out of the county.</P>
<P>Mr. Head borough, &s;lowly ri&s;ing from his chair, and gravely &s;nuff|ing the candle, begged leave to be hard&mdash;and he &s;aid, that as how, whereof, and wherefore, not &s;o much for the &s;aying of the thing, as tho'f it &s;hould be &s;aid, though to be &s;ure no man &s;hould be &s;artain &s;ure of his own judgement; yet for his part; now as to your genero&s;ity, he look's upon it to be a &s;ort of a &s;omething of a foreign plant, and we have nothing to do with it.&mdash;And as to your public &s;pirit, why ye know, gemmen of the we&s;try, I need not tell you, that is nothing more than a licence for publicans to fell &s;pirituous liquors. And as to your e&s;teem; wh&mdash;y &s;ome people e&s;teem brandy punch; and &s;ome people e&s;teem rum punch; for my part, give me a little &s;up of your rum punch; and if I was the people of Jamaica, if the people of England would not drink rum punch, why they &s;hould have no turtle, and then they would all be &s;tarved. And</P>
<P>Now gemmen of the we&s;try, I come to my imprimis, third and la&s;t; and that is your common &s;en&s;e, if I may be allowed to &s;peak my reflexions about it; I look upon it to be too common, and too vulgar a thing, for the gemmen of the we&s;try to trouble their heads with, or be con&s;arned about.</P>
<P>All the&s;e fine qualifications mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in oblivion, had not Chance recommended them to the family of O&s;tentation. Here is the lady of O&s;tentation's manor, her name was Vanity. She had a &s;i&s;ter named Wit, who ran away with Judgement, the hou&s;e &s;tew|ard; from which two was begat Genius; but as it's very common
<PB N="8" REF="10">to u&s;e Genius ill, &s;o &s;he &s;uffered many and great hard&s;hips, till at length &s;he was reduced to &s;o low an ebb, as to be obliged to lodge in a garret with the poet Oblivion, and his mother Nece&s;&s;ity. In proce&s;s of time Judgement, her father, found her out, and pro|moted a marriage between Genius and Science, and from that mar|riage were produced the&s;e five &s;ine children, Architecture, Painting, Poetry, A&s;tronomy, and Mu&s;ic. But the di&s;turbance at that time between the Goths and the Vandals, having overturned the temples of the Arts and Sciences, the&s;e &s;cientifics took &s;hipping, and a &s;torm ari&s;ing at &s;ea, they were &s;hipwreck'd on the inho&s;pitable coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, where, after being plundered of their wearing apparel, they were left to &s;tarve, by the inhumanity of the country people. The rea&s;on why our &s;ea &s;ide &s;avages may rob and plunder &s;hipwrecked pa&s;&s;engers with impunity, is owing to a defect in the Game Act, which was made for the pre&s;ervation of the Game all over England, the gentlemen who drew up that act forgetting to make men, women, and children game, though it is &s;o common, now-a-days, to make game of men, women, and children. They begged their way up to London on foot, where they were in hopes that the merit of their works would recommend them; poor creatures! 'tis a &s;ign they knew very little of the world, to imagine any &s;uch thing: however (to prevent &s;tarving) Architecture turned bricklayer's la|bourer to a Chine&s;e builder, Painting was a grinder of colours to a paper &s;tainer, Poetry turned Printer's Devil, Mu&s;ic &s;ung ballads about the &s;treets, and A&s;tronomy cried Almanacks. In &s;ome little time lady Fa&s;hion found them out, and, as &s;oon as lady Fa&s;hion found them out, all the world ran mad for their company.</P>
<P>This is a mo&s;t curious exhibition, and very likely to make the learned look about them; for as there is no mark or &s;ign to di&s;cover what it is, 'tis a &s;ure proof of it's being a genuine antique.&mdash;It may, for ought we know, be a king Solomon, or Queen Sameri|mis; an Old Venus, or a New Nabob, a Methodi&s;t Preacher, or a Bottle Conjuror. It was intended to place the face of Probability upon it; but that motion was &s;oon laid a&s;ide, as people, in our days, are only fond of improbabilities; at length, a part of the bronze, or plai&s;ter, being rubbed off, a letter was di&s;covered, by which it appeared to be the remains of the &s;tatue of Hone&s;ty; thus mauled and mutilated by the various inroads that had been made upon it.&mdash;Imagine not, &s;pectators, that this bu&s;t of Hone&s;ty is ex|hibited, as if the real face would be a &s;tranger to any one of this company;&mdash;No,&mdash;She is only &s;hewn here emblematically; the meaning of which is, that the manners of the times are &s;uch, as may put Hone&s;ty out of countenance.&mdash;Not as a companion, but as a contra&s;t to the head of Hone&s;ty, is</P>
<P>This, the head of Flattery, exhibited. The ancients had days they called White, or Lucky days; thus it is wiith Flattery; to the fortunate &s;he turns her white, her &s;hining &s;ide; to the unfortunate, &s;he is ever in eclip&s;e. Upon the approach of any ill fortune, Flat|tery
<PB N="9" REF="11">generally turns into Reproach; the meaning of which is, that it is a reproach to our under&s;tandings to &s;uffer Flattery, yet we con|tinue to accept the injury, though we de&s;pi&s;e the hand that offers it; not remembering that the receiver is as bad as the thief.</P>
<P>This being, Flattery, was begot on Poverty, by Wit; which is the rea&s;on why poor wits are generally the greate&s;t flatterers.</P>
<P>This Flattery was employed by the princes of the earth, to carry their congratulations one to another; but being at a certain time di&s;patched by the Dutch with a card of compliments to the Hotten|tots, the &s;hip &s;he went in was taken by a pyrate; the captain of which fell in love Flattery, left off the &s;ea for her &s;ake, took an inn, &s;et up, and made Flattery his bar-keeper: a gentleman ar|riving in tho&s;e parts in pur&s;uit of an heire&s;s, and having tried all efforts in vain, at la&s;t purcha&s;ed Flattery of the innkeeper; and, by her means, gained the lady. But to &s;ee the ingratitude of man kind, he had not been married a fort'night, before he kick'd Flattery out of doors; and, from that time to this, &s;he has had no &s;ettled place of abode, but is u&s;ually to be found at the beginning of court|&s;hip, and at the latter end of a petition. This being, Flattery, was the occa&s;ion of the very fir&s;t duel that ever was fought: &s;he was placed at the top of a pyramid, in the middle of an highway, where four roads met; two knights, adventurers, the one from the north, and the other from the &s;outh, arrived at the pyramid at the &s;ame in&s;tant; the hero from the &s;outh, who &s;aw this white &s;ide, &s;aid it was a &s;hame, that a white, a &s;ilver profile, &s;hould be tru&s;ted on the highway &s;ide. The hero from the north, who only &s;aw this, &s;aid,&mdash;A white, a &s;ilver profile, why it is a black one! Flat contradictions produced fatal demon&s;trations: their &s;words flew out, and they cut and hewed one another in a mo&s;t unmerciful manner; till fainting with the lo&s;s of blood, they both fell down, each on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to that on which the combat begun; when look|ing up, too late, they belield their mi&s;take. At this in&s;tant a ve|nerable hermit coming by, bound-up their wounds, and replaced them on their hor&s;es, giving them this piece of friendly advice, <Q>That, hence forward, in all political di&s;putes, and matters of a public nature, never to tru&s;t them&s;elves till they had examined both &s;ides of the que&s;tion.</Q></P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t part of this lecture we con&s;idered men's heads; in this &s;econd part, we &s;hall con&s;ider the head dre&s;s of the fine ladies; for as the world is round, and the world turns round, and every thing turns round with it; &s;o no lunar, or &s;ublunar revolution, hath cau&s;ed greater alteration in the affairs of men, than hath from time to time take place in the head dre&s;&s;es of the ladies.</P>
<P>From the Egyptians, from whom we derive all our arts and &s;ci|ences, philo&s;ophy and fa&s;hions, our good dames of antiquity &s;eem to have borrowed this riding-hood. Behold the riding-hood! how the lappets fall down the &s;ide of the face, like the lappets on the &s;ide of the face of the Egyptian mummy; or like the cumb'rous fo|liages of the full-bottom'd peruke; but our ance&s;tors di&s;liking the u&s;e of the&s;e full-bottoms, contrived a method of tying up their wigs behind; hence the origin of tye-wigs!&mdash;The ladies, too, not to be behind-hand with the gentlemen in their fa&s;hions, contrived a way to tye up their tails too; and from the riding-hood, they tucked up their tails and form'd the Ranelagh-hood; as for ex|ample;</P>
<P>This is the hood in high ta&s;te at the lower end of the town: and while this is wore by lady Mary, lady Betty, lady Su&s;an, and wo|men of great di&s;tinction; this is wore by plain Moll, and Be&s;s, and Sue, and women without any di&s;tinction at all! This is the inva|riable mode, or head-dre&s;s, of tho&s;e ladies, who u&s;ed to &s;upply the court end of the town with &s;ea dainties, before land carriage for fi&s;h came into fa&s;hion! And there is not more difference between the head dre&s;s of the&s;e ladies, than in their mode of conver&s;ation; for while the&s;e fine ladies are continually making inroads upon their mother tongue, and clipping poly&s;yllables into mono&s;yllables; as, when they tell us they caant, and they &s;haant, and they maant: the&s;e coar&s;e ladies make ample amends for their deficiency, by the addition of &s;upernumerary &s;yllables, when they talk of breakfa&s;tes, and toa&s;te&s;es, and running their fi&s;te&s;es again&s;t the po&s;te&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the antient laughing and crying philo&s;ophers, perpe|tual pre&s;idents of the noble and venerable orders of the Groaners and the Grinners. This the pre&s;ident of the di&s;mal faction, is al|ways crying for fear the world &s;hould not la&s;t his time out;&mdash;this, the member of the Choice Spirits, egad, he don't care whether it does or not. This laughs at the times; this cries at the times; and this blackguards the times; and thus the times are generally handled. Old people prai&s;e the times pa&s;t, which they neglected to u&s;e when they might; young people look forward with anxious care to the time to come, neglecting the pre&s;ent; and almo&s;t all people treat the pre&s;ent times, as &s;ome folks do their wives,&mdash;with indifference, becau&s;e they may po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">This was the fa&s;hionable mode, or head dre&s;s, in the times of our forefathers and foremothers; when a member of parliament's wife was jogged up to town once a year behind John, ju&s;t to &s;ee my Lord Mayor's &s;hew, and have her gown cut to the court fa&s;hion; and then, with her pillion new &s;tuffed, and her lap crammed with con|fectionary, &s;he was hoi&s;ted back again, as fine as a gingerbread &s;tall upon a fair day. From Minerva's helmet the ladies &s;eem to have taken the cu&s;tom of wearing bonnets; the pompoon, or egret, from the half moon that encircled the temple of Diana.</P>
<P>From the ancients, too, came this cu&s;tom of giving lectures, Juno, that termagant of antiquity, being the fir&s;t who ever gave her hu&s;band a lecture; and which, from the place where it was de|livered, was called a curtain lecture! And philo&s;ophers are of opi|nion, that the&s;e curtain lectures are not yet entirely out of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Homer, the hi&s;torian, from whom all the&s;e facts are taken, relates great things of the zone, or girdle of Venus;&mdash;and to it he a&s;cribes great virtue; he &s;ays, that whatever lady wears Venus's girdle, will infallibly po&s;&s;e&s;s the beauties of Venus. Now, ladies, I have that very girdle mentioned by Homer; and every lady will look lovely as long as &s;he chu&s;es to appear in it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Good Temper.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is a real antique, the morning head dre&s;s of that celebrated demi-rep of antiquity, Cleopatra; this is what a&s;tronomers call the night rain, or &s;hrouding the moon in a cloud; and to this day the ladies of Edinburgh, when they go abroad in the morning, fold a tarpin about their heads; or, as they expre&s;s it, they heep their heeds about in plaid. But our ladies in the &s;outh, di&s;liking &s;o cum|b'rous a fa&s;hion, and imagining that &s;omething whim&s;ically like it might be the invention of a new fa&s;hion, invented this French night cap, or cheek wrapper. A lady in this dre&s;s looks hooded like a hor&s;e, with eye-flaps,&mdash;to keep them from looking one way or the other; and perhaps that is the rea&s;on why mo&s;t ladies, in our days, choo&s;e to look forward! One would imagine that this cap was invented by &s;ome &s;urly duana, or ill-natured guardian, who being pa&s;t the reli&s;h of beauty them&s;elves, would deny even the fight of it to the re&s;t of mankind!</P>
<P>Since we are on the &s;ubject of ladies faces, permit me a word on the pernicious practice of face painting, or rubbing of rouge and white wa&s;h on the complexion. Women of the town may be al|lowed the u&s;e of paint, becau&s;e the dexterity of their profe&s;&s;ion, like that of pirates, con&s;i&s;ts in fighting under fal&s;e colours. But, for the delicate, the unculpable part of the &s;ex, to paint, looks as if they would fi&s;h for lovers, as men do for mackrel,&mdash;by hanging &s;omething red upon the hook; or as if they thought men were ge|nerally of the bull and turkey cock kind, and would &s;ly at any thing &s;carlet. Exerci&s;e is the be&s;t face painter; innocence the be&s;t giver of complexion. There is, however, a certain period in life
<PB N="12" REF="14">among the ladies, no le&s;s an enemy to the face, than the cu&s;tom of face painting; 'tis called antiquated virginity; when elderly un|married ladies are &s;uppo&s;ed to be condemned to lead apes about, becau&s;e, when they were young and hand&s;ome, they made monkies of mankind. Shake&s;pear has beautifully de&s;cribed the difference of the two &s;tates in the&s;e few lines, thus:
<Q><L>But earthly happier is the ro&s;e di&s;till'd,</L>
<L>Than that, which withering on the virgin thorn,</L>
<L>Lives, grows and dies in &s;ingle ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>We have here two heads taken from the&s;e lines of Shake&s;pear. This is the married ro&s;e, and this is that withering on the virgin thorn. Di&s;appointments bring on wrinkles; the wrinkles, there|fore, of this face, are no cau&s;e for wonder; the be&s;t wines, if kept too long, will turn to vinegar. But as this &s;ubject &s;eems to grow &s;erious, we'll di&s;mi&s;s it with a wi&s;h,
<Q><L>"May each married lady pre&s;erve her good man,</L>
<L>"And the young ones get good ones as &s;oon as they can."</L></Q></P>
<P>Not to be partial to either &s;ex, this is exhibited as the head of an old batchelor. The&s;e old batchelors are mere bullies in love; continually abu&s;ing matrimony, without daring to accept the chal|lenge. They tell ye, if they were married, their wives &s;hould not go abroad, when they plea&s;e; the children &s;hould never cry; the men &s;hould not ki&s;s the maids; O! they would do mighty matters! But the&s;e lion-like talkers abroad, are mere baalambs at home, and continually under &s;ubjection to &s;ome termagant of a mi&s;tre&s;s, who makes them amply repay to her in&s;olence, the contempt in which they pretend to have held the worthier part of the &s;ex. As a pu|ni&s;hment for their infidelity, when they are old and &s;uperannuated, they &s;et up for &s;uitors; they ogle through &s;pectacles, and they &s;ing love &s;ongs, with catarrhs, by way of &s;ymphony. This laced coat, &s;olitaire, and bag wig, &s;hew what he would be; and this fool's cap, what he is.</P>
<P>As this is an head in ancient primitive &s;implicity; &s;o here is an head, in modern &s;implicity, and belongs to a la&s;s of the &s;pirit u&s;u|ally called a Quaker. And</P>
<P>This is the head of one moved by the &s;pirit. He wears this large umbrella like covering, to keep off the outer light, to &s;trengthen the light within. As this is the hat of one moved by the &s;pirit, &s;o</P>
<P>This is a hat, in the true &s;pirit of the mode. This is a Niverne; or a Nivernoi&s;e; or a Nivernoi&s;e; or a Never enough: (it's all the &s;ame in the Greek) a fellow with &s;uch a hat as this, looks like a man coming from market with a &s;kimming di&s;h on his head. The French, perhaps, have acted wi&s;ely in curtailing the &s;ize of their hats, becau&s;e we have curtailed them of the fur trade; but, for Engli&s;hmen to wear &s;uch hats, is neither &s;ound policy, or common hone&s;ty; yet we per&s;i&s;t in copying the manners of the
<PB N="13" REF="15">French, though we know they de&s;pi&s;e us for imitation.&mdash;As there are two hats contra&s;ted, &s;o here are two heads contra&s;ted.</P>
<P>This, a plain, hone&s;t, well meaning, manly &s;entiment speak|ing countenance. This, with a French grin, and &s;imper, &s;eems to &s;ay,&mdash;<Q>Entendez vous Mon&s;ieur; entendez vous; Sire you have no complai&s;ance,</Q> To whom, this replies, <Q>But Sir, we have &s;incerity.</Q> <Q>Sire, we have de gran monarch.</Q> <Q>And we liberty.</Q> <Q>Sire, we come over to England every year to learn you.</Q> <Q>And yet &s;ir, we are very much your ma&s;ters.</Q> <Q>Point du tout, Point du tout. Not at all, not at all. You beat us in one part, and we go to anoder. The French be de vi&s;e people, they go all over the world to get money.</Q> And, the Engli&s;h, they go all over the world to &s;pend it.</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t part of this lecture, we con&s;idered wigs lexiconi|cally; in this part we &s;hall con&s;ider them phy&s;ically; or rather, a phy&s;ical wig: not as it relates to the faculty; but only with an intent to &s;hew, how &s;ome of the faculty treat their heads. This wig, is charactura of both doctor and apothecary, according to the doctrine of top&s;y turvey; which &s;uppo&s;es, that any apo|thecary may be a doctor, though no doctor can be an apothe|cary.</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming we may now look &s;omething like &s;ome of the faculty, we &s;hall attempt a di&s;&s;ertation on Sneezing and Snuff-taking; and this we &s;hall endeavour to execute in the true &s;ecundum&mdash;artem&mdash;medicum phra&s;e, which may &s;erve either for doctor, or apothecary-Sneezing, otherwi&s;e, learnedly called &s;ternutation, is occa&s;ioned by a violent, involuntary, impre&s;&s;ion, repre&s;&s;ion, compre&s;&s;ion, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the animal &s;pirits and nervous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luids; which acting on the nerves, which are &s;ub&s;ervient to the mu&s;cles and the diaphragma, communicate the &s;ame vibration, otherwi&s;e o&s;cellations, of the medellary &s;ub&s;tance, of the nerves, and excite tho&s;e impul&s;es and concu&s;&s;ion of the thorax which accompany &s;ter|nutation, by which means, the patient is in &s;uch a &s;ort of a kind of &s;ituation, that&mdash;if he has a pocket handkerchief he may wipe his no&s;e with it.

<P>There is the &s;nuff of Contempt; this is &s;ure to be taken by all well dre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, when they are in company with others with wor&s;e cloaths on than them&s;elves: for though we know there is a material difference between real genius, and Monmouth-&s;treet finery, yet the Pantheon of Parade &s;hall have crouded auditors, while the Temple of Merit &s;tands open without a wor&s;hipper.&mdash; When the performance of an Engli&s;h arti&s;t is exhibited as the work of a ma&s;ter unknown, its merit will have due prai&s;e; but the mo|ment his name is known, and he is found guilty of being an Eng|li&s;hman, admiration changes into di&s;gu&s;t, and the club of connoi&s;|&s;eurs take the &s;nuff of Contempt at him and his works immediately. &mdash;P&s;haw;&mdash;Paltry;&mdash;Damn'd bad,&mdash;Vile, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>With the&s;e heads we intended to have begun our di&s;&s;ection. This is the head of a blood: he wears a bull's forehead, for a fore|top, in imitation of that blood of old, Jupiter, who turned him|&s;elf into a bull, to run away with Europa: and to this day your bloods are mighty fond of making bea&s;ts of them&s;elves; this is a fine fellow to kick up a du&s;t; or to keep it up when it is kicked up; to chuck a waiter behind the fire; to&s;s a beggar in a blanket; play at chuck with china plates; hop round the room with a red hot poker in his mouth, upon one leg; &s;ay the belief backwards; &s;wallow red hot coals. Oh, he was qu-ite the thing. He was a wit, at Wetherby's; a toa&s;t-ma&s;ter, at Bob Derry's; a con&s;tant cu&s;tomer, at the Round-hou&s;e; a terror to mode&s;t women, and a dupe to women of the town; as one of whom,</P>
<P>This portait is exhibited. This is a man of the town, or a blood; and this is a woman of the town or a&mdash;but by what other title the lady chu&s;es to be called, we are not entitled to mention: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that when we attempted di&s;&s;ection, we found this head proof again&s;t our keene&s;t apparatus, and this &s;o &s;oft, that it mouldered away at the fir&s;t touch.</P>
<P>This is the Tea-table Critic; or ma&s;ter among the maids. He was mama's darling. His mama would never let him learn to read, for fear he &s;hould get a naa&s;ty cu&s;tom of holding down his head; but he was a purdigious &s;cholar for all that; he had got four pages of Hoyle by heart, which his mama's woman had taught him: and he could calculate, ho could calculate how much cream &s;hould be put into a codling tart. He died of a fit of de&s;pair for the lo&s;s of
<PB N="15" REF="17">his lap-dog; who was poi&s;oned with eating up the cold cream, that was prepared for his mama's next day's complexion. We di|vided the &s;uters of his brain with an ivory bodkin; but in&s;tead of the cutis, and the cuticula; the cerebum, and the cerebellum, medula oblong, and other hard words; we found nothing of them; and, for brains, we di&s;covered this pincu&s;hion. From the Tea-table Critic, we proceed to the Learned Critic, or Word-grubber.</P>
<P>This was an hunter after commas, &s;emicolons, and underevatas. This is a true cla&s;&s;ical conjugating countenance, and denotes dicti|onary dignity. He was one of tho&s;e learned Doctoribus's, who al|ways argued Propria quae maribus. He has for a band a pair of horn books, to denote that he was a man of mere letters. He lo&s;t his be&s;t friend, in a di&s;pute, relative to the pronunciation of a word: as he was one day walking in his friend's garden, little mi&s;s came running to him, "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>my papa's hor&s;e Cicero has won the race;</Q> foaming with rage, our grammarian bounces into the parlour, "Madam." &s;ays he, <Q>Why do you bring up your children thus? How dare you &s;uffer the&s;e violations of all grammar; you'll be the very de&s;truction of all learning and of all common &s;en&s;e! for the pronunciation of the word is not Cicero, but Kickero.</Q> Nature never does her works by halves; &s;he proportions the parts of all animals, to the u&s;e for which they are de&s;igned; thus, the ears of this critic are immen&s;ely large; they are called trap doors to catch &s;yllables! On the con|trary; his eyes are half clo&s;ed; that's called the Wi&s;eman's Wink; and &s;hews he can &s;ee the world with half an eye. He died of in|&s;anity of mind, or furor mentis, occa&s;ioned by a di&s;pute relating to the re&s;toring of oiled butter; he &s;aid, butter once oiled, could ne|ver be re&s;tored; and he proved it from the Greek too; at the very fame interim, in came Betty the cook maid, with a little &s;prinkling of flower, and no Greek, and re&s;tored it in a moment. When we came to a dissection of this head, in&s;tead of the hard terms u&s;ed by anatomi&s;ts, we found none of the parts thereby de&s;cribed; we found only large fragments of abu&s;e! epitomes of indexes and title pages: and all the brain covered over with a blotting paper. Be|fore we opened</P>
<P>This &s;tock-jobber's head, we had a mind to make an experiment upon the ear: but, as to notes of mu&s;ic, the cries of di&s;tre&s;s, the prai&s;e of merit, and the demand of gratitude, the &s;tock-jobber's head was like his &s;tock, con&s;olidated. We then thought of a me|thod of &s;triking one piece of money again&s;t another; we did &s;o. We &s;truck one &s;hilling again&s;t another; the chink of the money alarmed the member; and on our &s;triking one guinea again&s;t ano|ther, the ear expanded to its utmo&s;t extent; in other &s;ubjects, there are certain ve&s;&s;els that convey to the face a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, or the glow of innocence. In the &s;tock-jobber, they were all petrified. In other &s;ubjects there are certain ve&s;&s;els between the
<PB N="16" REF="18">head and the heart; called the nerves of humanity! in the &s;tock-jobber, they were all eaten up by the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>This is, Sir Full Fed Domine Double Chin; citizen, turtle, and veni&s;on eater. He was one of the common council of Farringdon within; he was a very good &s;ort of a man; he was half brother to an alderman, and had been deputy of his ward: his time was taken up in the affairs of the &s;tate, and the affairs of a kitchen. He loved politics, and he loved veni&s;on. He thought a cook was the greate&s;t genius in all the 'var&s;al world, except a news writer. He con&s;tantly read every political pamphlet that was publi&s;hed, and on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and always framed his opinion according to the writer he read la&s;t; and according to the humour he happened to be in; he would take his cap, and his pipe, and a gla&s;s of the righteous (as he called it) and he would be for &s;etting the world to rights in an hurry. Ay! Ay! neighbour Co&s;ter; all for their own ends now a-days; all for their own ends; nobody do you &s;ee now a-days, loves their own country, &s;ince queen Semaramus, and &s;he invented Solomon Gundy, and that's the be&s;t eating in all the 'var&s;al world. It I was at the head of affairs, things &s;hould not be as they are now; that's all; they &s;houldn't indeed. I would &s;hew them another way of a manner of going to work: now I'll &s;hew you my plan of operations. Do you mind me now, mark what I &s;ay: &s;uppo&s;e then the&s;e two or three bits of tobacco a&s;hes, to be the main land continent.&mdash;Ve&mdash;ry well, and &s;uppo&s;e now, neighbour Spriggins, this little drop of milk punch, (well come, here's the king, God ble&s;s him) &s;uppo&s;e this little drop of milk punch, to be the main &s;ea ocean: very well! very well! and &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e three or four bits of cork to be all our great men of war: very well! But what &s;hall I do now for fortified places? Oh, here I have it; he&mdash;re I have it. Here's your Havannahs, and your Pondicherries, and your Tilbury Ports, and your Tower Ditches; and all your damn'd &s;trong places! there's a plan of operations for ye now: A&mdash;h, Well, and then our army all &s;hould wear a new uniform; all our hor&s;e infantry &s;hould wear air jackets, and all our foot cavalry &s;hould wear cork wai&s;tcoats; and then ye know why they'd be all over the &s;ea before you could &s;ay Jack Robin&s;on. Well, and where do you think I'd land them now? You don't know; nor you don't know; how the devil &s;hould you know. You don't under&s;tand geometry. Why I'll tell you where I'd land them; I would land them under the line, clo&s;e by the South Pole; th&mdash;ere I'd land them; and then I'd ambu&s;cade all the Spaniards back &s;ettlements; and take from them all their (&mdash;P&s;haw&mdash; You know what I mean well enough; all their&mdash;all them damn'd hard names mentioned in the news papers) all their Mexicos and their Perus, and their Dimont I&s;lands! and then I'd come with a circumbendibus on the Dutch, in flat bottom'd boats; (becau&s;e ye know that is a flat bottom'd country) open the &s;luices&mdash;let in the water&mdash;drown all the poor Dutch, and then we &s;hould have the
<PB N="17" REF="19">turtles, and the Spice I&s;lands, for n in Old England.</P>
<P>While our politician was thus going on with his plan, cen&s;uring men and mea&s;ures he knew nothing about, and it happening at a time when our army lay encamped on one &s;ide of the river, and the French on the other; an officer in company, with his &s;tick, gave our politician a wrap on the knuckles: What's that for? A&mdash;y? Only, Sir, replied the officer, coolly, to inform you, that that commander who cro&s;&s;es a river to attack an enemy in front, may chance to get a wrap on the knuckles: that's all! The tran|&s;ition is ea&s;y from politicks to cunning.</P>
<P>Behold here the head of a &s;harper. In Truth's Dictionary, under the article Cunning, is the verb, to &s;harp; from whence the noun &s;ub&s;tantive &s;harper: that we may offend no countrymen by the birth of our hero, be it known that he was born at &s;ea, on board a tran&s;port, in which his mother was humbly reque&s;ted, by a rule of court, to take a &s;even years tour to America. At length, by his un&s;haken re&s;olution, and matchle&s;s impudence, he acquired a for|tune of forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This is his original face; a heavy, vulgar, incurious, down-looking, countenance: this was his holliday face, that he went into company with; and, under this ma&s;k of affability he play'd off all his &s;light of hand artillery; and this was his face when he awoke at midnight, when Con&s;cience, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Memory, com|manded him to undergo a &s;evere &s;elf examination; for, as there was nothing too ba&s;e for him to commit, &s;o neither was there any thing &s;o dreadful, but he had rea&s;on to fear. He lived in the ut|mo&s;t dread, and died in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair; putting a period to his exi&s;tence with this: which, in the catalogue of medicines, bears this name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suicide's Grand-Specific.</NOTE> He left all his fortune to the ho&s;pital for incurables, in Moorfields; that as he had got all his money by the incurables, &s;o he was very willing, now he could make no farther u&s;e of it, to return it to the right owners.</P>
<P>Although he had lived a life &s;o infamous, he was buried in all the to be purcha&s;ed pomp: behold here the funeral of the gambler! and two of his torch bearers! Such is the partiality of fate, and &s;uch the different rewards of merit and infamy; that, that &s;oldier and &s;ailor, are employed at the price of a &s;hilling, and glad too of that &s;canty pittance, to attend the gambler to his grave; the &s;ailor lo&s;t his arm in one of the famous &s;ea fights where Sir Edward Hawke commanded; and the &s;oldier lo&s;t his leg, in one of the &s;ix-regiments who &s;o bravely fought upon the plains of Minden. To &s;hew, however, how we treat our &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, when we have no occa&s;ion for them, we will ju&s;t beg leave to relate a &s;tory that happened in the year 1745; when our army, was marching into the North, under the command of the gallant Duke of Cumber|land.
<PB N="18" REF="20">The landlord of the hou&s;e where one of the &s;oldiers hap|pened to be, began to take great notice of him; and would &s;ay to him, why hone&s;t fellow, &s;ays he, you &s;oldiers are the pillars of the nation; you are the brave&s;t men in nature; without a &s;tanding army we &s;hould have no &s;tanding corn; when you come home, pray come and &s;ee me, you, and your wife, and your children, and &s;tay as long as you plea&s;e, a week, a month, or a year, as long as you plea&s;e, and make your&s;elves welcome to every thing you find here; and he always wound up his invitation with telling him that &s;oldiers were the pillars of the nation. When the affair at Culloden was happily over; our &s;oldier called, rather to thank him for his kind invitation, than with any de&s;ign to accept it. But, the danger being pa&s;t, and peace being re&s;tored, be began to talk about large taxes, and &s;tanding armies; and he did not know what occa&s;ion there was for a pack of lob&s;tering dogs to be crawling about the country, eating up peoples victuals and drink. He &s;aw no occa&s;ion we had for &s;oldiers now, not he, we had peace hadn't we? Why, cried, our &s;oldier, with a generous di&s;dain, I did not invite my&s;elf, did not you tell me to come, me and my family, and we &s;hould be welcome; and &s;ays he, did not you al|ways clo&s;e your invitation with &s;aying, that we &s;oldiers were the pillars of the nation?&mdash;pillars of the nation?&mdash;Well, I be|lieve I might &s;ay &s;omething about pillars; but I meant&mdash;catter|pillars.</P>
<P>Thus, while true merit is neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed, to &s;hew how Genius and Science can conde&s;cend to decorate unworthine&s;s; behold here, the monument of the Gambler,&mdash;Ju&s;tice and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, weeping over his medallion, and Honour de&s;cending with a crown of laurels, to reward his virtues; in the ba&s;&s;o-relief, are four little boys repre&s;enting the cardinal virtues, as weeping for his death; but we, who are apt to moralize on things, rather think they are four little boys who&s;e parents the gambler has ruined; and that they are now turned out of doors, and crying for cloaths to cover them.&mdash;This is the head of another kind of &s;harper, 'tis the head of a Conjuror, or Fortune-Teller; not that he could &s;ee any further into futurity than other mortals: no, his art lay chiefly in a nice ob&s;ervation of the follies and pa&s;&s;ions which actuated the human &s;pecies, but, chiefly, the fair part of the cre|ation; and by the help of a wand, gown, long beard, an old globe, and other ab&s;truce trumpery, he per&s;uaded his ea&s;y auditors that he conver&s;ed with the &s;tars; and, according to the fee they gave him, he would deliver his plau&s;ible progno&s;tics,
<Q><L>For wi&s;hing nymphs, he &s;oon would find</L>
<L>A hu&s;band, wealthy, hand&s;ome, kind;</L>
<L>And for the ambitious, he would &s;ix</L>
<L>A coronet, a coach and &s;ix.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21">He'd give the avaricious &s;tore,</L>
<L>And food and raiment to the poor.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, whatever their degree,</L>
<L>He'd &s;uit their wi&s;hes to a T.</L></Q>
Mo&s;t people thought that he conver&s;ed with the Devil; yet to &s;hew how little acquaintance he had with him, he was frightened to death, by the appearance of a large black dog, and the &s;trength of imagination, which made him believe the candles burnt blue. &mdash;From the head of one who lived by his wit, we proceed to a real wit; this is the famous Yorick, mentioned by Shake-&s;pear, and Tri&s;tram Shandy; and he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a good deal of the family likene&s;s: when we came to a di&s;&s;ection of this head, we found one lobe of the brain &s;welled to a pro|digious &s;ize, and the other wa&s;ted almo&s;t to nothing: he lived &s;o long depending on what others would do for him, that he was at length reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king Charity: among&s;t others of his re&s;ting places, he one day &s;et him&s;elf down at the door of a large man&s;ion-hou&s;e; &s;ome of the &s;er|vants hearing he was a Wit, had him into the &s;teward's par|lour; and where, according to the notion &s;ome people have of wit, they de&s;ired he would be comical. One of them &s;aid, if he was a wit, to be &s;ure he could run round the room with a red hot poker between his teeth.&mdash;The cook-maid &s;aid, to be &s;ure if the gentleman was a wit, &s;he hoped he would be &s;o kind, and &s;o civil, and &s;o obliging, and &s;o conde&s;cending, and &s;o complai&s;ant, and &s;o good, and &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, as to tell her fortune on the cards. &mdash;The butler was rather for a tune on the mu&s;ical gla&s;&s;es.&mdash; The groom &s;aid, if &s;o be as how the gentleman was a wit, why he could not do no le&s;s than ride three hor&s;es at once.&mdash;The laundry maid, &s;he &s;aid, to be &s;ure he could &s;wallow a box-iron and heaters.&mdash;While they were thus debating, down came the French Mamme&s;elle, and ordered him to be turned out of doors, &s;aying, "&s;he wondered vat Engli&s;h vit vas good for?"</P>
<P>Wit being thus turned out of doors, went to vi&s;it Ho&s;pitality; but it being election time, there was no room for him there. He then paid his addre&s;&s;es to Merit; but Merit could do nothing for him, being at that time pur&s;ued by Faction. He then ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Charity; and &s;he would have done any thing in the world to &s;erve him; but, as ill luck would have it, &s;he was her&s;elf that very morning ran over by the bi&s;hop's new &s;et of coach hor&s;es. He died, at length, of mere hunger; and was in|terred in the poor's burial-ground, after his friends had rai&s;ed money to pay the &s;urplice fees.</P>
<P>And the modes of Chri&s;tianity are &s;uch in our days, that though any churchman may receive large benefices, yet if any churchman be found guilty of giving away any of the church's money in cha|rity, he would be thought guilty of being righteous overmuch.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">Behold here one of the righteous overmuch&mdash;yet nought doth he give away in charity! No! no! he is the bell-weather of the flock, who hath broken down Orthodox's bounds, and now riots on the common of Hypocri&s;y.&mdash;With one eye he looks up to Heaven, to make his congregation think he is devout, that's his &s;piritual eye; and with the other eye he looks down to &s;ee what he can get; and that's his carnal eye; and thus, with locks flowing down his face, he &s;ays, or &s;eems to &s;ay, or at lea&s;t, with your permi&s;&s;ion, we'll at|tempt to &s;ay for him&mdash;</P>

The word bretheren comes from the Tabernacle, becau&s;e we all may breathe there&mdash;in.&mdash;If ye want rouzing, I'll rouze you: I'll beat a tattoo upon the parchment ca&s;es of your con&s;ciences, and whip the Devil about like a whirl-a-gig.&mdash;Even as the cat upon the top of the hou&s;e doth &s;quall out; even &s;o, from the top of my voice, will I bawl out, and the organ pipes of my lungs &s;hall play a voluntary among ye; and the &s;weet words that I &s;hall utter, &s;hall &s;ugar candy over your &s;ouls, and make car|raway comfirts of your con&s;ciences.&mdash;Do you know how many taylors make a man?&mdash;Why nine&mdash;Nine taylors make a man.&mdash; And how many make half a man?&mdash;Why four journeymen and a 'prentice.&mdash;Even &s;o have you all been bound 'prentice to Mi&s;|&s;olly the Fa&s;hion maker; and now you are out of your times you have &s;et up for your&s;elves.&mdash;My great bowells, and my &s;m&mdash;all guts groan for you.&mdash;I have got the gripe of compa&s;&s;ion, and the belly-ach of pity.&mdash;Give me a dram&mdash;Do give me a dram &mdash;A dram of patience I mean, while I explain unto you, what reformation, and what abomination mean! which the worldly wicked have mixed together like potatoes and butter-milk, and therewith made a &s;inful &s;tir-about.&mdash;Reformation, is like the comely froth at the top of a tankard of porter;&mdash;and Abomination &mdash;is like the dregs at the bottom of the tap tub.&mdash;Have you carried your con&s;ciences to the &s;cowerers lately?
