<P>LETTERS TO PARTICULAR FRIENDS,</P>
<P>BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> From the Year 1739 to
1763.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Character of Mr. <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> is too well
known, and his reputation as a Writer too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, to require
any further commendation, yet it may perhaps be expected that &s;ome apology
&s;hould be made for this volume of his Works, containing Familiar Letters to
&s;ome of his mo&s;t intimate Friends.</P>
<P>To the&s;e who may think &s;uch an apology re|qui&s;ite, it might
be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the reception which the former volumes have met
with, affords the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe that an addition to them
would be very accepta|ble to the Public; and that the author's talent in
<HI>epi&s;tolary</HI> writing appears not to have been inferior to that which
di&s;tingui&s;hes his other compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, that, whatever their merit may be,
<HI>Letters,</HI> not intended for the Public, ought not to be publi&s;hed, and
that an act of this kind is a violation of private friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This objection, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, carries with it &s;uch
an air of delicacy, that the per&s;ons here concerned are very willing to give
it all due attention. At the &s;ame time they cannot but ob&s;erve, that it
will not hold in all ca&s;es, and therefore mu&s;t unavoidably be &s;ubject to
&s;ome limitations&mdash;that the&s;e limitations mu&s;t <PB N="iv" REF="3">
vary, as the circum&s;tances of ca&s;es happen to vary&mdash;and that not to
make proper allowances for &s;uch circum&s;tances is highly
unrea&s;onable&mdash;injurious to many who have de&s;erved well of the Public
by this very conduct, and detrimen|tal to the intere&s;ts of Literature. It
might perhaps be difficult, and is by no means nece&s;&s;a|ry, to enumerate
the&s;e &s;everal limitations. It will be &s;ufficient in this place to &s;ay,
that where neither the reputation of the Writer, nor that of any other
per&s;on, is injured, there the force of the objection evidently cea&s;es. And
it is not only believed, on the mo&s;t mature deliberation, that this is the
ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; but moreover that the there are po&s;i|tive
good rea&s;ons in its favour, re&s;pecting as well the Writer's character in
this <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of compo|&s;ition, as the &s;atisfaction and
entertainment of the Reader.</P>
<P>The encouragement which has been u&s;ually given to Works of this
nature might &s;eem to make the&s;e ob&s;ervations unnece&s;&s;ary! But it was
not thought &s;ufficient barely to &s;helter this publication under the
&s;anction of &s;uch an autho|rity; as it is well known that the wantonne&s;s
of curio&s;ity has &s;ometimes encouraged de&s;ign by no means
ju&s;tifiable:&mdash;and it is as readily acknowledged that the following
Letters are deficient in many particulars requi&s;ite to excite that
curio&s;ity, being neither written on popular &s;ubjects, nor addre&s;&s;ed to
per&s;ons of rank and eminence in the world. They will not fail how|ever to
afford an agreeable entertainment to &s;uch as can reli&s;h an animated
di&s;play of the various efforts of a fine imagination for a length of years,
whether amu&s;ing it&s;elf with <PB N="v" REF="4"> rural embelli&s;hments, or
occupied in other plea|&s;ures of learned retirement, and a warm
di&s;in|tere&s;ted friend&s;hip. Such are the &s;ubjects of the following
Letters! and if any per&s;on &s;hould &s;till retain a doubt concerning the
propriety of perpetuating them in this manner, he &s;hall be finally referred
to the writer's own authority, who, in a letter dated October, 23, 1754, thus
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</P>
<Q>I confe&s;s to you that I am con&s;iderably mortified by Mr.
W&mdash;'s conduct in regard to tho&s;e Letters (meaning his own letters to
that gentleman's brother;) and, rather than they &s;hould have been &s;o
unnece&s;&s;arily de&s;troyed, would have given more money than it is
allowa|ble for me to mention with decency. I look upon my letters as &s;ome of
my <HI>chef-d'aeuvres</HI>; and could I be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the
&s;malle&s;t pre|ten&s;ions to propriety of &s;tyle or &s;entiment, I &s;hould
imagine it mu&s;t appear principally in my Letters to his brother, and one or
two more friends. I con&s;ider them as the records of a friend&s;hip that will
be alway dear to me, and as the hi&s;tory of my mind for the&s;e twenty years
pa&s;t.</Q>
<P>When it is con&s;idered how &s;eldom &s;o valuable a collection of
real corre&s;pondence is to be met with, and how difficult it is to &s;upply
the want of it by a fictitious one, it cannot be doubted that the Public will
be plea&s;ed to &s;ee the lo&s;s here complained of &s;o well repaired, and to
be furni&s;hed with &s;uch genuine examples of the Author's &s;tyle and
&s;entiments, together with an authentic hi&s;tory of his mind, for &s;o long a
&s;pace of time.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">To conclude: The talents of this Author, on
whatever &s;ubject they were exerci&s;ed, were &s;o uncommon, and the fame of
his little <HI>Ferme orn&eacute;e,</HI> under the conduct of a ta&s;te entirely
original, was become &s;o con&s;iderable, that every &s;pecimen of the one, and
every anecdote relative to the improvement of the other, &s;eemed too
intere&s;ting to be buried in oblivion: at lea&s;t, they were thought &s;o by
tho&s;e to whom the <HI>greater</HI> part of this Collection is
addre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;per&s;ons indeed confe&s;&s;edly partial to the Writer's
talents, and intere&s;ted in his commendations; but at the &s;ame time
per&s;ons neither &s;o regard|le&s;s of their Friend's reputation, nor their
own, as to have hazarded either, without the &s;trong|e&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion that
their partiality had not im|po&s;ed upon their judgement; and that it was no
indecent o&s;tentation in them, by this public act, to te&s;tify, that they
e&s;teemed it not only a peculiar felicity in their fortunes, but likewi&s;e
&s;ome degree of credit, to have enjoyed the plea|&s;ures of &s;uch a
friend&s;hip throughout &s;o con&s;i|derable a period of human life.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my head is con&s;iderably more confu&s;ed than u&s;ual, by
rea&s;on of a bad cold, I &s;hall aim no higher in this letter than at bare
<HI>recitative,</HI> re&s;erving all my <HI>airs</HI> for a &s;ea&s;on when my
mind is more in <HI>tune.</HI> Such, I hope, will be the time which you &s;et
apart to attend the <HI>chief mu&s;ician,</HI> at Birmingham. I thoroughly
de&s;ign to lend an <HI>ear</HI> to <HI>his</HI> performance, on con|dition he
will not refu&s;e one to a propo&s;al I in|tend to make, of having, one day or
other, a merry &s;train at the Lea&s;ows. But if you have any <HI>penchant</HI>
to &s;ee the face of your humble &s;ervant at Birmingham, your mo&s;t effectual
way will be to inform him when the&s;e &s;olemn nup|tials betwixt Tweedle-dum
and Tweedle-dee are to be con&s;ummated. I will, <HI>certes,</HI> not be
ab&s;ent at the throwing of the &s;tocking, any more than <PB N="2" REF="13">
Par&s;on Evans in Shake&s;peare would be 
<Q REND="inline">"ab&s;ence at the grace."</Q> I have &s;ent a
&s;ong, not that I am &s;ure I have not &s;ent it before; but that, if you can
&s;ee any joke that it containeth, the forementioned gentleman may be a&s;ked
to tran|&s;late it into mu&s;ic. When I u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion, you will,
peradventure, look upon it as my opinion, that in mu&s;ical compo&s;itions,
&s;ound ought as much to an&s;wer &s;en&s;e as one language does another,
in&s;omuch, that &s;uch and &s;uch thoughts ought to bring into our heads
&s;uch and &s;uch &s;ounds, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> But in ca&s;e there is
no &s;en&s;e, and no thought, the more languages a &s;entence is tran&s;lated
into, the more 'tis expo|&s;ed. And in ca&s;e it be the misfortune of my little
piece to have neither, I beg that Mr. Mar|riett may not inform any body what it
&s;ignifies in mu&s;ic. As a farther proof of the confu&s;ed &s;tate of my
intellects, you &s;ee, almo&s;t at the end of my letter, my thanks for the
packet, &amp;c. which ought to have been placed in the very front of it, in
order to expre&s;s, in &s;ome degree, the &s;en&s;e I have of your favours. I
long to &s;ee you; and am, dear Sir,</P>

<HEAD>II. To the &s;ame, in the Manner of PAMELA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1739.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WELL! and &s;o I &s;ate me down in my <HI>room,</HI> and was reading
<HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash;one might furni&s;h this book with &s;everal pretty
decorations, thought I to my&s;elf; and then I began to de&s;ign cuts for it,
in particular places. For in&s;tance, one, where Pamela is forced to fall upon
her knees in the arbor: a &s;econd, where &s;he is in bed, and Mrs. Jewkes
holds one hand, and Mr. B. the other: a third, where Pamela &s;its &s;ew|ing in
the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, &amp;c. So I ju&s;t &s;ketched them out, and &s;ent my
little hints, &s;uch as they were, to Mr. R&mdash;n. As &s;oon as I had
&s;ealed my letter, in comes Mrs. Arnold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His
hou&s;e-keeper, of whom very re&s;pectful mention is made in the cour&s;e of
this corre&s;pondence.</NOTE>&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mrs. Arnold," &s;ays I, "this Mr. Jago never
comes&mdash;what can one do? I'm as dull as a beetle for want of company."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Sir," &s;ays &s;he, "the hen"&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"What makes you out of breath," <PB N="4" REF="15">
&s;ays I, "Mrs. Arnold, what's the matter?"&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir," &s;ays &s;he, "the hen I &s;et la&s;t
&s;ab|bath-day-was-three-weeks has ju&s;t hatched, and has brought out all her
eggs to good."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"That's brave indeed," &s;ays I.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, that it is," &s;ays &s;he, "&s;o be and't

<Q REND="inline">"No, thank ye, Mrs. Arnold," &s;ays I; "but aren't
ye in &s;ome apprehen&s;ions from the kite, Mrs. Arnold?"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir," &s;ays &s;he; "I hope there's no danger;
I <HI>takes</HI> pretty good care of 'em."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I don't que&s;tion your care," &s;ays I; "for
you're &s;eldom without a duck or a chicken about you."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Poor pretty <HI>creters,</HI>" &s;ays &s;he; "look
here, Ma&s;ter, this has gotten a &s;peck of black upon her tail."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, I thought you wern't without one about you,"
&s;ays I: "I don't think," &s;ays I, "Mrs. Arnold, but your &s;oul was

<Q REND="inline"> "Why, and if I <HI>had</HI> been a hen," &s;ays
&s;he, "I believe I &s;hould have done as much for my chickens as yonder great
black-and-white hen does, tho' I &s;ay't that &s;hould not &s;ay't," &s;ays
&s;he.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, that you would," thought I. "Well, but now when
Jago comes, have you got e'er a chicken that's <HI>fit to kill?</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No." &s;ays &s;he, "I doubt there is
ne'er-a-one."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well," &s;ays I, "Mrs. Arnold, you and your chicken
may go down; I am going to write a letter."</Q> So I &s;at down, and wrote thus
far: &s;crattle, &s;crattle, goes the pen&mdash;why how now? &s;ays
I&mdash;what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s the mat|ter with the
pen? So I thought I would make an end of my letter, becau&s;e my pen went
&s;cratle, &s;crattle. Well, I warrant I &s;hall have little plea, &s;ure when
Mr. Jago <HI>comes</HI>; for I never fixed my heart upon any thing in my life,
but &s;ome misfor|tune happened to balance my plea&s;ure.&mdash;After all,
thought I, it mu&s;t be &s;ome very ill accident that outweighs the plea&s;ure
I &s;hall take in &s;eeing him.</P>

<HEAD>III. To a Friend, too ceremoniou&s;ly declining to purcha&s;e a
Hor&s;e for him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1739.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT avoid imagining the fir&s;t part of your letter was mere
raillery. I am &s;ure it gave me a good deal of plea&s;ure (for I can bear very
well to hear my foibles expo&s;ed, though not my faults) and on that account
mu&s;t needs make grateful mention of it. I acknowledge the oddne&s;s of the
letter which occa&s;ioned it, and could not expect that &s;uch an ill-formed
appli|cation could have produced an an&s;wer &s;o very oratorical. In the
fir&s;t place, you lay open the &s;ubject, or indeed, what you call the offices
in which I am plea&s;ed to employ you. In the next, you alledge your own
inability to enter upon matters of &s;uch great concernment. That this is
rhetorical, nay, pure rhetoric, I gather from the exordiums of all the
declamations that I ever heard in my life. 'Tis, moreover, not uncommon with
declaimers to give &s;ome rea&s;ons why they &s;hould not ab&s;olutely decline
the &s;ub|ject, though they are &s;en&s;ible of their in&s;ufficiency
(otherwi&s;e they might be expected to &s;it down, and hold their tongues.) And
this is what you have done, by &s;aying that you are unwilling to di&s;&s;ent
from the world in regard to the &s;ubjects you are engaged in. That you,
therefore, cho&s;e to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e, by that means avoiding the
imputation of pre&s;umption on the one hand, and indifference on the other.
When this is done, you enter gravely upon the &s;ubject, and, to give it a
greater per&s;picuity, divide it into two parts. The fir&s;t part happens to be

<Q REND="inline">"concerning the purcha&s;e of <HI>an</HI>
hor&s;e."</Q> On this occa&s;ion, you inform me, that I am in a good country
for hor&s;es; and, &s;econdly, that I have a number of <PB N="6" REF="17">
acquaintance round about me, who are very well &s;killed in the nature of them.
Now each of the&s;e informations &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to mean no more
than what I have better opportunities of knowing than the per&s;on who informs
me, and, on this account, to err in point of &s;uper|fluity. But, upon &s;econd
thoughts, they have <HI>this force</HI> (to &s;peak like a grammarian) namely,
that I am entirely negligent of my own affairs; and, &s;econdly, that I care
not whom I give trouble to, if I can but avoid it my&s;elf; &s;o that the
&s;enten|ces have really a beauty, when one &s;earches be|neath their
&s;uperficies. After you have &s;aid this and more, which includes all that can
be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject, you de&s;cend to the &s;econd divi&s;ion, in
relation to which I am too grateful to be otherwi&s;e than <HI>&s;eri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> in my acknowledgments.</P>
<P>I had not expatiated thus far but to &s;hew that I am not
in&s;en&s;ible of a &s;neer; nor &s;hould I expa|tiate any farther, but to
prove, that I am equally &s;en&s;ible of a favour.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you would believe, that I ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ent to your
critique. That &s;ome of your &s;en|timents were my own before I communicated
the ver&s;es; and others, as &s;oon as you had favoured me with the di&s;covery
of them. That I would, <HI>per prae&s;entes,</HI> return my thanks for them;
which you might ju&s;tly have claimed, whether I had approved them or not. One
exception to this approbation my mode&s;ty bids me mention, on account of your
too great partiality in my fa|vour. My gratitude you are entitled to, without
exception or limitation.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, gratify your curio&s;ity to know, that Mr. G. has
a copy of ver&s;es in the la&s;t magazine, entitled, 
<Q REND="inline">"The little Cur."</Q> There are &s;everal &s;trokes
that are picture&s;que and hu|morous; I believe it was done in ha&s;te. The
motto is exqui&s;ite, and much more properly ap|plied by Mr. G. than the
Emperor Adrian, in <PB N="7" REF="18"> my opinion, notwith&s;tanding all that
Pope &s;ays. Tell me your judgment of Mr. L&mdash;n's in the &s;ame paper. The
epigram 
<Q REND="inline">"To one who refu&s;ed to walk in the Park,
&amp;c."</Q> is a good one.</P>
<P>I have waved &s;ending the ver&s;es to Mr. Somer|vile at pre&s;ent,
becau&s;e I hope to &s;ee you &s;oon either at the Lea&s;ows or at Birmingham.
I can't tell whether I &s;hall have time to inclo&s;e in this letter my ballad.
If I do, con&s;ider it only as &s;ome words that I chu&s;e to make u&s;e of to
&s;ome notes of which I am more than ordinarily fond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tune, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come and li&s;ten to my ditty, &amp;c."</Q> The
words &s;ounded upon a true hi&s;tory of Queen Elizabeth, who, looking from a
ca&s;tle, wherein &s;he was a pri&s;oner, and &s;eeing a country milk-maid
&s;inging, expre&s;&s;ed great envy at the girl's condition, and
di&s;&s;atisfaction with regard to her own.</NOTE>. It is as much de&s;igned
for my own &s;inging (in private I mean) as ever was a bottle of cherry-brandy
for an old woman's drinking. Now I think of it, I really believe that I every
day approach nearer and nearer to the capacity, the way, the in&s;ignificancy,
of an old woman. Mrs. Arnold has certainly, by her <HI>charms,</HI> her
incantations, and her conver&s;ations together, contributed a good deal to this
transformation. Pray come over if you can, and try to rein&s;tate me in my
right mind, in proportion to the &s;oundne&s;s of which I &s;hall be more and

<P>I RETURN you my thanks, mo&s;t heartily, for the poetical

is plenty of common ob&s;erva|tions. Have you &s;een the &s;ermons on the

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now with regard to the <HI>town</HI> pretty much in the &s;ame
&s;tate in which I expect to be always with regard to the <HI>world</HI>;
&s;ometimes exclaiming and railing again&s;t it; &s;ometimes giv|ing it a good
word, and even admiring it. A &s;un-&s;hiny day, a tavern-&s;upper after a play
well acted, and now and then an invigorating breath of air in the Mall, never
fail of producing a chearful effect. I don't know whether I gave you any
account of Quin's acting Fal&s;taff in my former letter: I really imagined that
I &s;aw you littering on one &s;ide me, &s;haking your &s;ides, and &s;ometimes
&s;carce containing your&s;elf. You'll pardon the attitude in which I placed
you, &s;ince at was what &s;eemed <HI>natural</HI> at that circum&s;tance of
time. Comus I have once been at, for the &s;ake of the &s;ongs, though I
dete&s;t it in any <HI>light:</HI> but as a <HI>dramatic</HI> piece the
<HI>taking</HI> of it &s;eems a <HI>prodigy</HI>; yet indeed
<HI>&s;uch-a-one,</HI> as was pretty to|lerably accounted for by a gentleman
who &s;ate by me in the <HI>boxes.</HI> This learned &s;age, being a&s;ked how
he liked the play, made an&s;wer, 
<Q REND="inline">"He could not tell&mdash;pretty well, he
thought&mdash;or indeed as well as any other play&mdash;he always took it, that
people only came there to &s;ee and to be &s;een&mdash;for as for what was
&s;aid, he owned, he never under&s;tood any thing of the matter."</Q> I told
him, I thought a great many of its admirers were in his ca&s;e, if they would
but own it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it is amazing to con&s;ider to what an
univer&s;ality of learning people make <PB N="11" REF="22"> preten&s;ions here.
There's not a drawer, a chair or hackney coach-man, but is politician, poet,
and judge of polite literature. Chimney-&s;wee|pers damn the Convention, and
black-&s;hoe-boys cry up the genius of Shake&s;peare. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Dan|ger of writing Ver&s;e"</Q> is a very good
thing; if you have not read it, I would recommend it to you as poetical. But
now I talk of learning, I mu&s;t not omit an interview which I acciden|tally
had the other night in company with Lord D&mdash; and one Mr. C&mdash;. We were
taken to &s;up at a private hou&s;e, where I found a per&s;on whom I had never
&s;een before. The man behaved exceeding mode&s;tly and well; till, growing a
little merry over a bottle (and being a little countenanced by the &s;ubject we
were upon) he pulls out of his pocket about half a dozen ballads, and
di&s;tributes them among&s;t the com|pany. I (not finding at fir&s;t they were
of his own compo&s;ition) read one over, and, finding it a dull piece of
&s;tuff, contented my&s;elf with ob|&s;erving, that it was exceedingly well
<HI>printed.</HI> But to &s;ee the man's face on this occa&s;ion would make you
pity the circum&s;tance of an author as long as you live. His jollity cea&s;ed
(as a flame would do, &s;hould you pour water upon it;) and, I be|lieve, for
about five minutes, he &s;poke not a &s;yllable. At length, recovering
him&s;elf, he be|gan to talk about his country-&s;eat, about Hough|ton Hall,
and &s;oon after de&s;ired a health, ima|gining (as I found afterwards) that
Lord D&mdash; would have given Sir Robert's. But he did not, naming Sir
T&mdash; L&mdash;: mine, which followed, was that of Mr. L&mdash;. Now, who do
you think this &s;hould be, but hone&s;t Ralph Freeman (at lea&s;t the writer
of the paper &s;o &s;ub&s;cribed) your father's old friend and intimate, Sir
Robert's right-hand, a per&s;on that lives elegantly, drives &s;ix of the
be&s;t hor&s;es in town, and plays on St. John's organ: (you know Mr. L&mdash; is
not <PB N="12" REF="23"> only Sir Robert's greate&s;t enemy, but the
Gazet|teer's proper antagoni&s;t.) We were invited to &s;ee him very civilly,
and indeed the man behaved with the utmo&s;t good humour, without arro|gance,
or any attempts at wit, which, probably, would not have been very
&s;ucce&s;sful. A&s;k your father what he would &s;ay to me, if I &s;hould join
in the cau&s;e with his old friend, and take a good annuity under Sir Robert,
which, I be|lieve, I might have; and little encouragement, God knows, have I
met with on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. I &s;ay, I believe I <HI>might
have,</HI> becau&s;e I know a certain per&s;on gives pen&s;ions of three pound
a week to porters and the mo&s;t illi|terate, &s;tupid fellows you can imagine,
to talk in his behalf at ale-hou&s;es; where they fit &s;o long a time, and are
as regularly relieved as one centry relieves another. At lea&s;t tell him that
I expect in his an&s;wer to my letter (which I &s;hall not allow him to
a&s;&s;ign to you) he write &s;ome|thing to confirm me in my integrity, and to
make me prefer him, and you, and hone&s;ty, to lace, brocade, and the &s;miles
of the ladies, 
<Q>Et Veneri, &amp; cunis, &amp; plumis Sardanapali.</Q> But I hope
to keep my Hercules in view, whe|ther in print or manu&s;cript; and though I am

<P>I de&s;ire I may hear from you next po&s;t: I have a line or two,
which I intend for the <HI>&s;ons of utter darkne&s;s</HI> (as you call them)
next maga|zine: I would &s;end them to you, for your advice, but cannot readily

<P>I &s;ent a letter to Mr. Marriett at Bath, to be left with you at

<P>If I wi&s;h for a <HI>large</HI> fortune, it is rather for the

tho&s;e morali&s;ts who <PB N="14" REF="25"> argue for the univer&s;ality of
<HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t,</HI> it is to gratify my&s;elf in the company, and in

<P>Dr. Ratcliff has &s;ent me a letter, which gives me much

forbear adding, that he expects to hear, &s;ince my pen has &s;o well adorned

illu&s;trate the moral. However, the &s;imple approbation of a

a more courtly one.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal errors of the pre&s;s, which neither &s;agacity
nor vigilance it&s;elf, I now &s;ee, can prevent, and which I beg you to
correct with your pen, in a copy which I mu&s;t get you to pre&s;ent to
C&mdash; L&mdash;, together with the inclo&s;ed letter. Plea&s;e to be at the

will repay you.</P>
<P>I was loitering ye&s;terday in the coffee-room, when two per&s;ons
came in, well-dre&s;&s;ed, and called for my poem; read a page or two, and
commended the four lines upon Mr. L&mdash; ex|tremely; 
<Q REND="inline">("Lov'd by that prince, &amp;c.")</Q> repeated them
forty times, and, in the end, got them by heart, mentioned them to a

<HI>was</HI> fired with, and then endeavoured to mimic the prince's way of
talking; but, &s;ays he, <HI>I'll</HI> &s;hew <HI>the four be&s;t lines in the

<Q REND="inline">"'Twas youth's perplexing &s;tage, &amp;c."</Q>
which are flat enough, God knows&mdash;but to my fir&s;t heroes; one of them

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND &s;ome difficulty in writing to you on this melancholy
occa&s;ion. No one can be more unfit to attempt to le&s;&s;en your grief than
my&s;elf, becau&s;e no one has a deeper &s;en&s;e of the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of
your affliction. Though I would by no means be numbered by you among&s;t the
common herd of your acquaintance, that tell you they are &s;orry, yet it were
impertinent in me to mention a mere friend's concern to a per&s;on intere&s;ted
by &s;o many more tender regards. Be&s;ide, I &s;hould be glad to alleviate
your &s;orrow, and &s;uch fort of condolence tends but little to promote that
end. I do not chu&s;e to flatter you; neither could I, more e&s;pecially at
this time; but though I could perhaps find enough to &s;ay to per&s;ons of
le&s;s &s;en&s;e than you, I know of nothing but what your own rea&s;on mu&s;t
have &s;ugge&s;ted. Concern indeed may have &s;u&s;pended the power of that
faculty; and upon that pretence I have a few things that I would &s;ugge&s;t to
you. After all, it is time alone, that <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> cure
<HI>all</HI> afflictions, but &s;uch as are the con&s;equence of vice; and
your's, I am &s;ure, proceeds from a <HI>contrary</HI> principle.</P>
<P>I heard accidentally of this &s;orrowful event, and accompanied you
to London with the umo&s;t concern. I wi&s;hed it was in my power to miti|gate
your griefs by &s;haring them, as I have often found it in yours to augment my
plea&s;ures by &s;o doing.</P>
<P>All that I can recommend to you is, not to confine your eye to any
&s;ingle event in life, but to take in your whole circum&s;tances before you
repine.</P>
<P>When you reflect that you have lo&s;t one of the be&s;t of men in a
father, you ought to com|fort <PB N="17" REF="28"> your&s;elf that you had
&s;uch a father; to whom I cannot forbear applying the&s;e lines from Milton:

&s;atisfactory as it is in my power; and I hope you will ever look upon me as
your hearty friend, through all the vi&s;&s;itudes of life.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficulties through which I went,
the night I left you at Barels; which I looked upon as ordained by fate for the
temporal puni&s;hment of ob&s;tinacy. It was very kind, and in charac|ter for
you to endeavour to deter me from the ways of darkne&s;s; but having a &s;ort
of <HI>penchant</HI> for needle&s;s difficulties, I have an undoubted right to
indulge my&s;elf in them, &s;o long as I do <PB N="18" REF="29"> not in&s;i&s;t
upon any one's pity. It is true, the&s;e ought not to exceed a certain degree;
they &s;hould be <HI>lenia tormenta</HI>; and I mu&s;t own the labours I
underwent that night, did not come within the bounds which my imagination had
pre&s;cribed. I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger.&mdash;I rode
along a con&s;iderable piece of water covered &s;o clo&s;e with trees, that it
was as probable I might have pur&s;ued the channel, which was dangerous, as my
way out of it. Or, to put my ca&s;e in a more poetical light, having by night
intruded upon an amour betwixt a Wood-nymph and a River-god, I owed my e&s;cape
to Fortune, who conveyed me from the vengeance which they might have taken. I
put up finally at a little alehou&s;e about ten o'clock, and lay all night
awake, counting the cords which &s;upported me, which I could more &s;afely
&s;wear to than to either bed or blanket. For farther particulars, &s;ee my
epi&s;tle to the Pa&s;tor Fido of Lapworth.&mdash;Mr. Graves &s;ays, he
&s;hould be glad to &s;hew you any civilities in his power, upon his own
acquaintance; and will &s;erve you as far as his vote goes, upon my
re|commendation; but is afraid, without the con|currence of &s;ome more
con&s;iderable friends, your chance will be but &s;mall <HI>this</HI> year,
&amp;c. If the former part of this news gives you any plea&s;ure, I a&s;&s;ure
you it gives me no le&s;s to communicate it; and this plea&s;ure proceeds from
a principle which would induce me to &s;erve you my&s;elf, if it &s;hould ever
be in my power.&mdash;I &s;aw Mr. Lyttleton la&s;t week: he is a candidate for
the county of Worce&s;ter, together with Lord Deer|hur&s;t; I hope Mr.
Somervile will do him the honour to appear as his friend, which he mu&s;t at
lea&s;t think &s;econd to that of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>I hear you are commenced chaplain &s;ince I &s;aw you. I wi&s;h you
joy of it. The chaplain's title is infinitely more agreeable than his office; 
<PB N="19" REF="30"> and I hope the &s;carf, which is expre&s;&s;ive of it,
will be no diminutive thing, no fourpenny-half|penny piece of ribboning; but
that it will

<L>Di&s;dain all u&s;ual bounds, extend its &s;way,</L>

<P>I hope it will prove ominous, that my fir&s;t letter is a

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for the favour of your la&s;t letter, particularly your
readine&s;s in tran&s;|mitting to me any thing of Mr. Somervile's. It &s;o fell
out, that Mr. Outing delivered to me the ver&s;es, and I had the plea&s;ure of
reading them about a moment before he gave me your epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>The town expected &s;omething of importance, namely, a motion for a
committee of enquiry into late mea&s;ures, would be moved for to day. If any
thing of this nature has been carried on, I will add an account of it before I
clo&s;e my letter. In the mean time, it is, I believe, very credible, that Lord
Orford has a continued in|fluence over the King; and that the Duke of 
<PB N="21" REF="32"> Argyle is &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;ted, to have talked of
the re&s;ignation of his po&s;ts again.</P>
<P>An odd &s;tory enough the following, and I believe true! Somebody
that had ju&s;t learnt that Hor W 's gentleman's name was Jack&s;on, writes a
letter to Mr Floyer, keeper of the Tower, intimating his ma&s;ter's de&s;ire to
&s;peak with him. Floyer dre&s;&s;es the next morning, and waits upon

<P>YOUR la&s;t letter gave me a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, in rgard

opportunity of gratifying me with the news of it. I &s;hall be glad to employ
you and Mr. Jago in my little rivulet before winter comes, <PB N="22" REF="33">
when one mu&s;t bid adieu to rural beauties. Tho&s;e charming &s;cenes, which
the poets, in order to render them more compleat, have furni&s;hed with ladies,
mu&s;t be &s;tript of all their ornaments. Tho&s;e incomparable nymphs, the
Dryads and the Nereids, which have been my con&s;tant com|panions this &s;hort
&s;ummer, will vani&s;h to more plea&s;ing climes; and I mu&s;t be left to
&s;eek my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in real beauties, in&s;tead of imaginary ones. In
&s;hort, I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worce&s;ter, or &s;ome
other town. I was at a concert there, a very full one, lately. I ob&s;erved Dr.
Mackenzie talking to Mr. Lyt|tleton; and I hope, on that account, he is in his
intere&s;t; otherwi&s;e Mr. Somervile would do Mr. Lyttleton great &s;ervice by
engaging him.&mdash;Mr. Lyttleton took occa&s;ion to mention to me, the
obligation he lay under to Mr. Somervile for his letter, as well as his other
de&s;igns in his fa|vour&mdash;that he had long received great plea&s;ure from
that gentleman's pen, and wi&s;hed for the honour of his acquaintance. I told
him, I be|lieved the &s;atisfaction would be mutual, or to that purpo&s;e. He
added, that the Chace was an <HI>extremely</HI> beautiful poem, the be&s;t by

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee I am <HI>extremely expeditious</HI> in an|&s;wering your
letter; the rea&s;on of which is a very powerful one, namely, the information
which I received la&s;t night, that it would be agreeable to you I &s;hould do
&s;o. Plea&s;e, there|fore, to &s;et a&s;ide the &s;um of eighteen pence, or
thereabouts, for letters which you will receive whil&s;t I am in London; and,
to make it &s;eem the le&s;s profu&s;ely &s;quandered, con&s;ider it among&s;t
any other ca&s;ual expences which you carele&s;sly &s;ubmit to, merely to
gratify your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I went the other night, with the greate&s;t ex|pectations, to &s;ee 
<Q REND="inline">"The Merry Wives of Wind|&s;or"</Q> performed at
Covent-Garden. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how much every thing fell
below my ideas. But I have <HI>con&s;idered &s;ince</HI>; and I find, that my
expectations were really more unju&s;t than their manner of acting.
<HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> in order to act well, &s;hould have &s;omething of the
author's fire, as well as a polite education. And what makes this the clearer
to me is, that you hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in compa|ny, to one
that you find well performed upon the &s;tage.&mdash;Nothing can be more
ignorant or affected than the &s;cornful airs which &s;ome peo|ple give
them&s;elves at a country play; becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they have &s;een plays
in town. The truth is, the chief advantage of plays in town lies entirely in
the &s;cenery. You &s;eldom ob&s;erve a &s;et of &s;trollers without one or two
actors who are quite equal to their parts; and I really know of no good one, at
either of the two Theatres Royal, except Cibber, who rarely acts, and Mrs.
Olive, I will add one more, in <HI>compliance</HI> with my <HI>own</HI> ta&s;te
<HI>merely,</HI> and that is Mr. Neal, a <PB N="24" REF="35"> fellow who, by
<HI>playing the fool,</HI> has gained my particular <HI>e&s;teem.</HI></P>
<P>After the play, we had an <HI>entertainment</HI>;&mdash;fal&s;ely
&s;o called! It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice, the mo&s;t
<HI>un-mu&s;ical</HI> thing I ever heard, and which la&s;ted, I believe, three
hours, with &s;ome intermixtures of Harlequin; both &s;o dull, and yet heard
with patience, that I was amazed, a&s;toni&s;hed, confounded; but really a
<HI>man</HI> of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> ought not to be &s;o; becau&s;e they were
not calculated for <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I want you here extremely;&mdash;pray come up for a week. I
&s;uppo&s;e you will not, &s;o I will not argue &s;uperfluou&s;ly. However,

in &s;uch as you conver&s;e with. I take it to be owing partly to dre&s;s, and
partly to the <HI>avowed profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of reli|gion. A young clergyman,
that has di&s;tingui&s;h|ed his genius by a compo&s;ition or two of a polite
nature, and is capable of dre&s;&s;ing <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and his
<HI>religion,</HI> in a different manner from the ge|nerality of his
profe&s;&s;ion, that is, without for|mality, is certainly a genteel character.
I &s;peak this not with any &s;ly de&s;ign to advi&s;e, but to in|timate, that
I think you very capable of <HI>&s;hining</HI> <PB N="27" REF="38"> in a
dark-coloured coat.&mdash;You mu&s;t con&s;ider me yet as a man of the world,
and endeavouring to elicit that plea&s;ure from gaiety, which my rea&s;on tells
me I &s;hall never find.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how &s;tupid I
have been ever &s;ince I came home, in&s;omuch that I cannot write a common
letter without &s;ix repetitions. This is the third time I have begun yours,
and you &s;ee what &s;tuff it is made up of. I mu&s;t e'en ha&s;ten to matter
of fact, which is the comfortable re|&s;ource of dull people,&mdash;though,
even as to that, I have nothing to <HI>communicate.</HI> But I would be glad to
know, whether you are under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of re&s;iding on week-days; and,
if not, why I may not expect you a day or two at the Lea&s;ows very
&s;oon.&mdash;Did you make any enquiry concerning the number of my poems &s;old
at Ox|ford? or did you hear any thing concerning it that concerns me to
hear?&mdash;Will S&mdash; (for that is his true name) is the exce&s;s of
&s;implicity and good-nature. He &s;eems to have all the indu&s;try imaginable
to divert and amu&s;e people, without any ambitious ends to &s;erve, or
almo&s;t any con|cern whether he has &s;o much as a laugh allowed to his
&s;tories, any farther than as a laugh is an indication that people are
delighted. This, joined with his turn of thought, renders him quite agreeable.
I wi&s;h it were in my power to conciliate acquaintance with half his

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Sept. 13, 1741.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very agreeably entertained by your la&s;t letter, as indeed I
am by every one of yours. It were affectation to except a paragraph or two on
account of partiality, where, to &s;ay the truth, the partiality it&s;elf
plea&s;es one.&mdash;This I am very po&s;itive of, that to have a friend of
your temper and ta&s;te will always give me plea&s;ure, whether I plea&s;e the
world or no; but to plea&s;e ever &s;o much, without &s;ome &s;uch
friend&s;hip, would, in all probability, &s;ignify but little. I &s;hall,
therefore, value any means that tend to confirm my opinion of your e&s;teem for
me, pre|ferably to any that &s;hew me I am merely de&s;erving of it. After all,
though a very limited number of <HI>friends</HI> may be &s;ufficient, an idle
per&s;on &s;hould have a large <HI>acquaintance</HI>; and I believe I have the
lea&s;t of any one that ever rambled about &s;o much as I have done. I do not
know how it is, but I ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of ever being introduced into the
world. It may be objected by &s;ome (but you will not object it) that I may be
acquainted with a &s;ufficient number of people that are my <HI>equals,</HI> if
I <HI>will.</HI> They may be my <HI>equals</HI> and <HI>&s;upe|riors,</HI> whom
they mean, for aught I care; but their conver&s;ation gives me no more
plea&s;ure than the <HI>canking</HI> of a goo&s;e, or the quacking of a duck,
in affluent circum&s;tances. Rather <HI>le&s;s</HI> indeed of the two,
becau&s;e the idea of the &s;at goo&s;e flatters one's appetite; but the
<HI>human goo&s;e</HI> is neither fit to be heard nor eaten. I wi&s;h in|deed
to be <HI>&s;hewn into</HI> good company; but, if I can at all di&s;tingui&s;h
the nature of my inclina|tions, it is more in hopes of meeting with a re|fined
conver&s;ation, than any thing el&s;e. I do not at all in&s;i&s;t that my
genius is <HI>better</HI> than that <PB N="29" REF="40"> of my vociferous
neighbours; if it be <HI>different,</HI> it is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why I
&s;hould &s;eek &s;uch companions as &s;uit it; and whether they are found in
high or low life, is little to the pur|po&s;e. But you will perhaps di&s;cern
the opera|tions of <HI>vanity</HI> in all my endeavours; I will not di&s;agree
with you, provided you will allow <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> an equal &s;hare in
them. It is the va|nity to be intimate with men of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;en&s;e,
not of di&s;tingui&s;hed fortune. And this is a vanity which you &s;hould not
di&s;approve, be|cau&s;e it will bind me a la&s;ting friend to you and your
family.</P>
<P>I have been over at Shiffnall, and, in order to make my&s;elf
agreeable, rode a hunting with Mr. Pitt. I confe&s;s I was &s;omewhat diverted;
and my hor&s;e was &s;o much an enthu&s;ia&s;t, as to be very near running
headlong into a deep wa|ter. I believe, if I were to turn &s;port&s;man, I
&s;hould &s;oon break my neck, for fear the hunt&s;|man &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e
me.</P>
<P>I will certainly endeavour to &s;ee you at Bir|mingham; but beg you
would write me a long letter in the mean time; and contrive, if you can, to
make it look like a packet, as your la&s;t did, for the &s;ight thereof is
exceedingly com|fortable.</P>
<P>Though my wi&s;hes will not &s;uffer me to believe that your eyes
are in the danger you repre&s;ent; yet, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be only very
weak, I would recommend &s;ome mu&s;ical in&s;trument, that is mo&s;t agreeable
to you. I have often looked upon mu&s;ic as my dernier re&s;ort, if I &s;hould
ever di&s;|card the world, and turn eremite entirely. Con|&s;ider what other
amu&s;ement can make an equal impre&s;&s;ion in old age.</P>
<P>I have filled my paper not without difficulty, through the
barrenne&s;s of my brain, and &s;itua|tion: my heart ever &s;lows with the
mo&s;t warm &s;treams of gratitude and affection for you. Adieu!</P>

<P>I WONDER I have not heard <HI>from</HI> you lately&mdash;<HI>of</HI>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Now I am come home from a vi&s;it&mdash;every little
unea&s;ine&s;s is &s;ufficient to introduce my whole train of melancholy
con&s;iderations, and to make me utterly di&s;&s;atisfied with the life I now
lead, and the life which I fore&s;ee I &s;hall lead. I am angry, and envious,
and dejected, and fran|tic, and di&s;regard all pre&s;ent things, ju&s;t as
be|comes a madman to do. I am infinitely plea&s;ed (though it is a gloomy joy)
with the application of Dr. Swift's complaint, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he is forced to die in a rage, like a
poi&s;oned rat in a hole."</Q> My &s;oul is no more &s;uited to the figure I
make, than a cable rope to a cambrick needle:&mdash;I can|not bear to &s;ee the
advantages alienated, which I think I could de&s;erve and reli&s;h &s;o much
more than tho&s;e that have them.&mdash;Nothing can give me patience but the
&s;oothing &s;ympathy of a friend, and <HI>that</HI> will only turn my rage
into &s;im|ple <PB N="31" REF="42"> melancholy.&mdash;I believe &s;oon I
&s;hall bear to &s;ee no-body. I do hate all hereabouts already, except one or
two. I will have my <HI>dinner</HI> brought upon my table in my ab&s;ence, and
the plates fetched away in my ab&s;ence: and no|body &s;hall &s;ee me: for I
can never bear to ap|pear in the &s;ame &s;tupid mediocrity for years
to|gether, and gain no ground. As Mr. G&mdash; com|plained to me (and, I think,
you too, both un|ju&s;tly,) 
<Q REND="inline">"I am no character."&mdash;</Q>I have in my temper
&s;ome raki&s;hne&s;s, but it is checked by want of &s;pirits; &s;ome
&s;olidity, but it is &s;oftened by vanity: &s;ome e&s;teem of learning, but it
is broke in upon by lazine&s;s, imagination, and want of memory,
&amp;c.&mdash;I could reckon up twenty things throughout my whole

<P>YOU mu&s;t give me leave to complain of your la&s;t letter, three
parts of which is filled with mere apology: I thought we had &s;ome time
agreed, for our mutual emolument, to lay a&s;ide ceremonies of this &s;pecies;

Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, for God's &s;ake? Why&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;he is
prelate of the Garter&mdash;an order, in all kinds of ceremony &s;o greatly
abounding.&mdash;Here am I &s;till, trifling away my time, my money, and, I
think, my health, which I fancy greatly inferior to what it it would be in the
country. Truth is, I do make &s;hift to vary my days a little here; and, 
<PB N="32" REF="43"> calling to mind the many irk&s;ome hours, the &s;tupid
identity of which I have been &s;o often &s;ick in the country, I conclude that
I am le&s;s <HI>un|happy</HI> than I &s;hall find my&s;elf at
home.&mdash;Howe|ver, next month I hope to &s;ee the Lea&s;ows with an
appetite.&mdash;Walks in the park are now de|lightfully plea&s;ant: the company
&s;tays in the Mall till ten every night.&mdash;Mrs. Olive, Mrs. Wof|fington,
Barbarini, and Mr. Garrick (happy man!) are gone over to Ireland, to act there
for two months.&mdash;Mr. Outing, the la&s;t time I &s;aw him, told me how Dr.
Mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with &s;crubs,

will contend that I have no more <HI>haughty</HI> one.&mdash;This &s;ubject I
could expatiate upon with plea&s;ure; but I &s;top: a ta&s;tele&s;s fellow has

<P>IF a friend of yours who lived in the farthe&s;t part of China were

&s;o that at this very in&s;tant I am <HI>impatient</HI> to &s;ee you.

<SALUTE>My good friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR old friend Somervile is dead! I did not imagine I could have
been &s;o &s;orry as I find my&s;elf on this occa&s;ion. 
<Q REND="inline">"Sublatum quaerimus."</Q> I can now excu&s;e all his
foibles; impute them to age, and to di&s;tre&s;s of circum|&s;tances; the
la&s;t of the&s;e con&s;iderations wrings my very &s;oul to think on. For a man
of high &s;pirit, con&s;cious of having (at lea&s;t in one pro|duction)
generally plea&s;ed the world, to be plagued and threatened by wretches that
are low in every &s;en&s;e; to be forced to drink him|&s;elf into pains of the
body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind, is a mi&s;ery which I can
well conceive, becau&s;e I may, without va|nity, e&s;teem my&s;elf his equal in
point of oeco|nomy, and con&s;equently <HI>ought</HI> to have an eye on his
misfortunes: (As you kindly hinted to me at twelve o'clock at the Feathers) I
&s;hould retrench;&mdash;I will; but you &s;hall not &s;ee me:&mdash;I will not
let you know that I took your hint in good part. I will do it at &s;olitary
times, as I may: and yet there will be &s;ome difficulty in it; for whatever
the <HI>world</HI> might e&s;teem in poor Somervile, I really find, upon
critical en|quiry, that <HI>I</HI> loved him for nothing &s;o much as his
flocci-nauci-nihili-pili fication of money.</P>
<P>Mr. A&mdash; was honourably acquitted: Lord A&mdash;, who was
pre&s;ent, and behaved very in|&s;olently <PB N="39" REF="52"> they &s;ay, was
hi&s;&s;ed out of court. They proved his application to the carpenter's &s;on,
to get him to &s;wear again&s;t Mr. A&mdash;, though the boy was proved to have
&s;aid in &s;everal compa|nies (<HI>before</HI> he had been kept at Lord
A&mdash;'s hou&s;e) that he was &s;ure the thing was acciden|tal. Finally, it
is believed he will recover the title of A&mdash;ea.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ion of the whores, and the &s;uffocation of four in
the round-hou&s;e, by the <HI>&s;tupidity</HI> of the keeper, engro&s;&s;es the
talk of the town. The &s;aid hou&s;e is rebuilding every day (for the mob on
Sunday night demoli&s;hed it), and re-demoli&s;hed every night. The Duke of M
&mdash;gh, J&mdash; S&mdash; his brother, Lord C&mdash; G&mdash;, were taken
into the round-hou&s;e, and confined from eleven at night till eleven next day:
I am not po&s;itive of the Duke of M&mdash;gh, the others are certain: and that
a large number of people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion went from the round-hou&s;e
to De Veil's, to give in informations of their u&s;age. The ju&s;tice him&s;elf
&s;eems greatly &s;cared; the pro&s;ecution will be carried on with violence,
&s;o as probably to hang the keeper, and there is an end.</P>
<P>Lord Bath's coachman got drunk and tumbled from his box, and he was
forced to borrow Lord Orford's. Wits &s;ay, that it was but gra|titude for my
Lord Orford's <HI>coachman</HI> to drive my Lord Bath, as my Lord Bath
<HI>him&s;elf</HI> had driven my Lord Orford. Thus they.</P>
<P>I have ten million of things to tell you; tho' they all amount to no

<HEAD>XXII. To Mr. Graves, on Benevolence and Friend&s;hip.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Jan, 19, 1741-2.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT forbear immediately writing to you: the plea&s;ure your
la&s;t letter gave me puts it out of my power to re&s;train the over|flowings
of my benevolence. I can ea&s;ily con|ceive that, upon &s;ome extraordinary
in&s;tances of friend&s;hip, my heart might be <HI>&s;i &s;ort attendri,</HI>
that I could not bear any re&s;traint upon my ability to &s;hew my gratitude.
It is an ob&s;erva|tion I made upon reading to day's paper, which contains an
account of C. Khevenhuller's &s;uc|ce&s;s in favour of the Queen of Hungary. To
think what &s;ublime affection mu&s;t influence that poor unfortunate Queen,
&s;hould a faithful and zealous General revenge her upon her enemies, and
re&s;tore her ruined affairs!</P>
<P>Had a per&s;on &s;hewn an e&s;teem and affection for <HI>me,</HI>
joined with any elegance, or without any elegance, in the expre&s;&s;ion of it,
I &s;hould have been in acute pain till I had given &s;ome &s;ign of my
willingne&s;s to &s;erve him.&mdash;From <HI>all</HI> this, I conclude that I
have more humanity than &s;ome others.</P>
<P>Probably enough I &s;hall never meet with a larger &s;hare of
happine&s;s than I feel at pre&s;ent. If not, I am thoroughly convinced, my
pain is greatly &s;uperior to my plea&s;ure. That plea&s;ure is not
ab&s;olutely dependent on the mind, I know from this, that I have enjoyed
happier &s;cenes in the company of &s;ome friends, than I can po&s;&s;ibly at
pre&s;ent;&mdash;but alas; all the time you and I &s;hall enjoy together,
ab&s;tracted from the re&s;t of our lives, and lumped, will not perhaps amount
to a &s;olid year and a half. How &s;mall a proportion!</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="54">People will &s;ay to one that talks thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"Would you die?"</Q> To &s;et the ca&s;e upon a
right footing, they mu&s;t take away the hopes of greater happine&s;s in
<HI>this</HI> life, the feares of great|er mi&s;ery hereafter, together with
the bodily <HI>pain</HI> of dying, and addre&s;s me in a di&s;po&s;ition
betwixt mirth and melancholy; and I could ea&s;ily re&s;olve them.</P>
<P>I do not know how I am launched out &s;o far into this complaint: it
is, perhaps, a &s;train of con&s;titutional whining; the effect of the
wind&mdash;did it come from the winds? to the winds will I deliver it: 
<Q> 
<L>Tradam protervis in mare Creticum,</L> 
<L>Portare ventis&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I will be as happy as my fortune will permit, and make others &s;o: 
<Q> 
<L>Pone me pigris ubi <HI>nulla campis</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Arbor</HI> ae&s;tiva recreatur aura.</L></Q></P>
<P>I will be &s;o. The joke is, that the de&s;crip|tion which you gave
of that country was, that you had few trees about you; &s;o that I &s;hould
<HI>trick</HI> fortune if &s;he &s;hould grant my petition im|plicitly. But in
earne&s;t, I intend to come and &s;tay a day or two with you next &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Mr. Whi&s;tler is at Mr. Go&s;ling's, book&s;eller, at the Mitre and
Crown, in Fleet-&s;treet, and en|quired much after you in his la&s;t letter to
me. He writes to me; but I believe his affection for one weighs le&s;s with
him, while the town is in the other &s;cale. Though he is very obliging. I do
not know whether I do right, when I &s;ay I believe we three, that is, in
&s;olitary circum|&s;tances, have an equal idea of, and affection for, each
other. I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing each to be alone, or in the country, which is
nearly the &s;ame; for &s;cenes alter minds as much as the air influ|ences
bodies. For in&s;tance, when Mr. Whi&s;tler <PB N="42" REF="55"> is in town, I
&s;uppo&s;e we love him better than he does us; and when we are in town, I
&s;up|po&s;e the &s;ame may be &s;aid in regard to him.</P>
<P>The true burle&s;que of Spen&s;er (who&s;e cha|racteri&s;tic is
&s;implicity) &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in a <HI>&s;imple</HI> repre&s;entation of
&s;uch things as one laughs to <HI>&s;ee</HI> or to <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> one's
&s;elf, rather than in any <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> contra&s;t between the thoughts
and words. I cannot help thinking that my added &s;tanzas have more of his
manner than what you &s;aw before, which you are not a judge of, till you have
read him.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH your la&s;t letter &s;eemed to put my corre&s;pondence upon
an o&s;tentatious footing, namely, an inclination to be witty, yet I a&s;&s;ure
you it was not any punctilious con&s;ide|ration of that kind that has kept me
&s;o long &s;ilent. Indeed with &s;ome people one would &s;tand upon the
nice&s;t punctilios; for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity
it&s;elf, yet it &s;urely weighs as much as the acquaintance of the
un|de&s;erving. But this is trifling, becau&s;e it can have no reference to a
per&s;on for whom I have the greate&s;t affection.</P>
<P>In regard to my Oxford affairs, you did all I could expect. I have
wrote &s;ince to Mr. M&mdash;, who, either for your &s;ake or mine, will, I
dare &s;ay, &s;ettle them to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="56">I wi&s;h your journey and head-ach would have
permitted you to have been a little more parti|cular concerning the &s;eat of
the Mu&s;es; but I &s;uppo&s;e nothing material di&s;tingui&s;hed your
fortnight.</P>
<P>Mr. Whi&s;tler has relap&s;ed at Whitchurch; but purpo&s;ed, when I
la&s;t heard from him, to go to London before this time. I do not en|tirely
under&s;tand his &s;chemes, but &s;hould have been &s;incerely glad of his
company with me this winter; and, he &s;ays, he is not fond of
London.&mdash;For my part, I de&s;igned to go thither the next month, but the
fever (which is chiefly violent in towns) di&s;courages me.</P>
<P>Some time ago, I read Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen; and, when I had
fini&s;hed, thought it a proper time to make &s;ome additions and corrections
in my trifling imitation of him, the School-mi&s;tre&s;s. His &s;ubject is
certainly bad, and his action in|expre&s;&s;ibly confu&s;ed; but there are
&s;ome parti|culars in him that charm one. Tho&s;e which afford the greate&s;t
&s;cope for a ludicrous imita|tion are, his &s;implicity and ob&s;olete
phra&s;e; and yet the&s;e are what give one a very &s;ingular plea|&s;ure in
the peru&s;al. The burle&s;que which they occa&s;ion is of quite a different
kind to that of Philips's Shilling, Cotton's Trave&s;tie, Hudibras, or Swift's
works; but I need not tell <HI>you</HI> this. I inclo&s;e a copy, for your
amu&s;ement and opi|nion; which, if franks are plentiful, you may return, and
&s;ave me the <HI>tedious</HI> trouble of writ|ing it over again. The other
paper was, <HI>bona fide,</HI> written to divert my thoughts from pain, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on that I &s;moaked; actions equally reputable.</P>
<P>Mr. Somervile's poem upon hawking, called, 
<Q REND="inline">"Field Sports,"</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e, is out by this
time. It was &s;ent to Mr. Lyttleton, to be read to the Prince, to whom it was

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad the &s;tay you make in Hereford|&s;hire amu&s;es you, even
though it puts you upon preferring the place you re&s;ide at to my own place of
re&s;idence. I do not know whe|ther it be from the prejudice of being born at

no other, would &s;ome one, by an addition of two hundred pounds a year, put it
in my power to exhibit my own de&s;igns. It is what I can now do in no other
method than on paper. I live in &s;uch an un|oeconomical manner, that I mu&s;t
not indulge my&s;elf in the plantation of a tree for the fu|ture. I have
glutted my&s;elf with the extremity of &s;olitude, and mu&s;t adapt my expences
more to &s;ociable life. It is on this account that it &s;eems more prudent for
me to buy a chair while <PB N="45" REF="58"> I am in town, than to carry down
twelve gui|neas for the model of the tomb of Virgil, an urn, and a &s;cheme or
two more of like nature.&mdash;I long to have my picture, <HI>di&s;tantly</HI>
approach|ing to a profile (the be&s;t manner I can think of to expre&s;s
my&s;elf), drawn by Davi&s;on. I have &s;een your &s;i&s;ter's, and think the
<HI>face</HI> well done in every re&s;pect;&mdash;but am greatly indignant with
other things of a le&s;s fixed nature The cap, though a good cap enough, has a
vile effect; the formality of &s;tays, &amp;c. not agreeable.&mdash;I do not
know if you &s;aw the picture of a Scotch girl there at full length! Mi&s;s
Graves has the advantage of her's, or any picture there, in her per&s;on; but
certainly this girl's hair is inexpre&s;|&s;ibly charming! There is the
genteele&s;t negli|gence in it I ever &s;aw in any picture:&mdash;what follows,
but that I wi&s;h your &s;i&s;ter would give orders to pull off her cap, and
have hair after the manner of this picture?&mdash;To &s;peak abruptly; as it
<HI>is,</HI> I di&s;approve it: were it altered, I &s;hould like it beyond any
I ever &s;aw.&mdash;I am glad you are reading Spen&s;er: though his plan is
dete&s;|table, and his <HI>invention</HI> le&s;s wonderful than mo&s;t people
imagine, who do not much con&s;ider the obviou&s;ne&s;s of allegory; yet, I
think, a per&s;on of your di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t take great delight in his
<HI>&s;implicity,</HI> his good-nature, &amp;c. Did you ob&s;erve a &s;tanza

<P>When I bought him fir&s;t, I read a page or two of the Fairy Queen,
and cared not to pro|ceed. After that, Pope's Alley made me con|&s;ider him
ludicrou&s;ly; and in that light, I think, one may read him with plea&s;ure. I
am now (as Ch&mdash;mley with &mdash;), from trifling and laughing at him,
really in love with him. I think even <PB N="46" REF="59"> the metre pretty

your calculations re&s;pecting Mickleton. I would have certainly met you there,
as you de&s;ired me: there is no company I am fonder of than yours, and your

Mickleton. But your brother has lo&s;t one of his recom|mendations in my eye;
that is, his <HI>irregularity</HI> of hou&s;e-keeping. He has &s;everal left,
which are &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve my utmo&s;t e&s;teem; but that was a jewel

have no objection to vi&s;it <HI>young, un&s;ettled people,</HI> with a
mountebank's incon&s;i&s;tency in my equipage. But where a con&s;iderable
family keeps up its forms (as marriage requires) I &s;hould not care to appear
with an hired hor&s;e, and a <HI>Sancho</HI> for my valet. The ca&s;e is, I
<HI>could</HI> live in a way genteel enough, and uniformly &s;o; but then, I
mu&s;t forego megrims, whims, toys, and &s;o forth. Now, though it gives me
pain, <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> not to appear of a piece; yet that

which I find in an urn, a &s;eal, a &s;nuff-box, an engraving, or a bu&s;t.
Ambition, too, as it puts me upon wi&s;hing to make a figure, makes me very

con&s;true it as any <HI>hint</HI>; nei|ther, if I am right, would you be &s;o

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t been &s;pending my evening at a coffee-hou&s;e; and,
notwith&s;tanding the con|fu&s;ed effect of liquor, am &s;itting down to write
to a per&s;on of the cleare&s;t head I know. The <HI>truth</HI> is, I write to

nothing has &s;o much tran&s;ported as young Cibber's <HI>exhibition</HI> of
Parolles, in Shake&s;peare's 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>All's well that ends well.</HI>"</Q> The
character is admirably written by the author; and, I fancy, I can di&s;cover a
great number of hints which it has afforded to Congreve in his Bluff. I am apt
to think a per&s;on, after he is twelve years old, laughs annually le&s;s and
le&s;s: le&s;s heartily, however; which is much the &s;ame. I think Cibber
elicited from me as &s;incere a laugh as I can ever recollect. Nothing, &s;ure,
can be com|parable to his repre&s;entation of Parolles in his bully-character;
except the figure he makes as a &s;habby gentleman. In his fir&s;t dre&s;s he
is taw|dry, as you may imagine: in the la&s;t, he wears a ru&s;ty black coat, a
black &s;tock, a black wig <PB N="51" REF="64"> with a Ramillie, a pair of
black gloves; and a face!&mdash;which cau&s;es five minutes
laughter.&mdash;In&s;tead of politics, I have tran&s;cribed the&s;e epi|grams

<P>DR. Swift would not have &s;crupled to print your parody, with his

inclination to print it in a large folio, four leaves, price four-pence: but I

plea&s;ure; odd picture&s;que de&s;cription. Send me word whether I &s;hall
print it or no&mdash;and that right &s;oon.&mdash;I have lingered in town till
now, and did not receive your letter till this morning.&mdash;I do not know
whether I &s;hall &s;end you with this letter a little thing which I wrote in
an after|noon, and, with proper <HI>demands</HI> of being con|cealed as the
author, &s;old for two guineas.&mdash;Next time I am in town, I will get money
like a haberda&s;her. I will amu&s;e my&s;elf with find|ing out the people's

you &s;end, it would fix your reputation with men of &s;en&s;e as much as
(greatly more than) the whole tedious character of Par&s;on Adams. I read it
half a year ago; the week after I came to town; but made Mr. Shuckburgh take it
again, imagining it alto|gether a very mean performance.&mdash;I liked a tenth
part pretty well; but, as Dryden &s;ays of Horace (unju&s;tly) he &s;hews his
teeth without laughing: the greater part is <HI>unnatural</HI> and
<HI>unhumourous.</HI> It has &s;ome advocates; but, I ob&s;erve, tho&s;e not
&s;uch as I ever e&s;teemed ta&s;ters. Finally, what makes <HI>you
endeavour</HI> to like it?</P>
<P>My printer was preparing his bill for the School-mi&s;tre&s;s, when
I &s;topped him &s;hort, with a hint to go to Dod&s;ley, who has not yet

Dr. Young's Complaint is the be&s;t thing that has come out this &s;ea&s;on
(the&s;e <HI>twenty years,</HI> Pope &s;ays) except mine, for &s;o
<HI>thinks</HI> every author, who does think proper to &s;ay &s;o: poor Pope's

<HI>coar&s;e&s;t</HI> is mo&s;t <HI>humorous</HI>) mu&s;t &s;urely mortify him.
Your &s;i&s;ter does me great honour to think my hint any thing; but I am quite
zealous in my appro|bation of that Scotch lady's hair. I will <HI>ever</HI> aim
at <HI>oddne&s;s,</HI> for the future; it is cheaper to follow ta&s;te than

certainly the &s;cene for a man of curio&s;ity.&mdash;I do not purpo&s;e to be

<P>If I get over this ill habit of body, depend upon it, I
<HI>will</HI> have a <HI>reverend</HI> care of my health, as Sir John
Fal&s;taff advi&s;es the Chief Ju&s;tice. <PB N="61" REF="74"> I &s;olve all
the tempe&s;ts that di&s;turb my con&s;titu|tion into <HI>wind:</HI> it plagues
me, fir&s;t, in the &s;hape of a bad appetite, then indige&s;tion, then
low|ne&s;s of &s;pirits and a flux of pale water, and at night by watchings,
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, twitchings of my nerves, or a &s;leep more di&s;tracted
than the mo&s;t active &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s. But I think purging
le&s;&s;ens all the&s;e &s;ymptoms, and I tru&s;t my &s;cheme that I am
entering upon is right.</P>
<P>I was, on Monday, at Hagley, to wait on Mr. Lyttleton, who was gone
to Sir John A&s;t|ley's, to &s;ee his grand edifice.&mdash;As to Mrs.
Lyt|tleton, if her affability is not artificial, I mean if it does not owe its
original (as it <HI>ought to do</HI> its <HI>management</HI>) to art, I cannot
conceive a per|&s;on more amiable;&mdash;but <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and
<HI>elegance</HI> cannot be &s;eigned: to <HI>exhibit</HI> them, is to
<HI>have</HI> them.</P>
<P>How is my &s;ong &s;et? Mi&s;s Carrington pro|cured it that favour;
but I have never &s;een a copy, nor knew of its being to be printed. Howard has
&s;et another of mine, which I re|ceived la&s;t po&s;t; but my harp&s;ichord is
out of order, and I have found no one yet to explain the hieroglyphicks which
convey it. You may probably find it in &s;ome future number of the Briti&s;h
Orpheus. 
<Q REND="inline">"By the &s;ide of a &s;tream, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>I am in as good &s;pirits this in&s;tant as ever I was in my life:
only 
<Q REND="inline">"Mens turbidum laetatur."</Q> My head is a little
confu&s;ed; but I often think &s;eriou&s;ly, that I ought to have the mo&s;t
ardent and <HI>practical</HI> gratitude (as the Methodi&s;ts chu&s;e to
expre&s;s them&s;elves) for the advantages that I have: which, though not
eminently &s;hining, are &s;uch, to &s;peak the truth, as &s;uit my particu|lar
humour, and, con&s;equently, de&s;erve all kind of acknowledgment. If a poet
&s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf to God Almighty, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t thanks
for his goodne&s;s in allotting him an e&s;tate that was over-run with
&s;hrubs, thickets, and coppices, variegated with barren rocks and 
<PB N="62" REF="75"> precipices, or floated three parts in four with lakes and
marches, rather than &s;uch an equal and fertile &s;pot as the 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;ons of men"</Q> delight in; to my
apprehen&s;ion, he would be guilty of no ab&s;urdity.&mdash;But of this I have
compo&s;ed a kind of prayer, and intend to write a little &s;pe|culation on the
&s;ubject; this kind of gratitude I a&s;&s;uredly ought to have, and have. For
my health, if one reflects, a country-fellow's &s;tock of it would be unfit for
&s;olitude; would di&s;po&s;e one rather to bodily feats, and, what Fal&s;taff
calls in Poins, <HI>gambol</HI> faculties, than mental contemplations, and
would give one that kind of pain which &s;prings from <HI>impatience.</HI> My
con|&s;titution was given me originally good; and with regard to it now (as G.
Barnwell &s;ays) 
<Q REND="inline">"What am I?&mdash;What I <HI>have made
my&s;elf.</HI>"</Q> Or, to &s;peak with Milton, 
<Q> 
<L>Him after all di&s;putes</L> 
<L>Forc'd I ab&s;olve: all my eva&s;ions vain,</L> 
<L>And rea&s;onings, tho' thro' mazes, only lead</L> 
<L>But to my own conviction. Fir&s;t and la&s;t</L>

is but vulgarly expre&s;&s;ed in Milton neither.</P>
<P>Jago has been here this la&s;t week, and I drove him to Dudley
Ca&s;tle, which I long to &s;hew you: I never &s;aw it (&s;ince I was the

Derby&s;hire may render it of &s;mall note in your eye.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not a contrived apology, or an excu&s;e, which I am going to
offer for the di&s;ap|pointments I have given you. I have actually been &s;o
much out of order ever &s;ince I wrote to you, nay, ever &s;ince I <HI>formed a
de&s;ign</HI> of a Sun|day expedition to L&mdash;, that it never has been in my
<HI>power</HI> to execute my intentions. My ver|tigo has not yet taken away my
&s;en&s;es; God knows how &s;oon it may do; but my nerves are 
<PB N="64" REF="77"> in &s;uch a condition, that I can &s;carce get a wink of
even <HI>di&s;ordered</HI> re&s;t for whole nights together. May you never know
the mi&s;ery of &s;uch invo|luntary vigils! I ride every day almo&s;t to
fa|tigue; which only tends to make my want of &s;leep more
<HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI> and not in the lea&s;t to re|move it. I have
<HI>&s;pirits</HI> all day, good ones; though my head is dizzy, and I never
enterprize any &s;tudy of greater &s;ubtlety than a news-paper. I cannot &s;ay
the journey to L&mdash; would be at all <HI>formidable</HI> to me; for I ride
about fifteen miles, as I compute it, every day before dinner. But the nights,
from home, would be in&s;uppor|table to me. I have fatigued Mrs. Arnold's
a&s;&s;iduity, to the injury of her health; by occa|&s;ioning her to &s;it in
my room a'nights, light my candle, put it out again, make me per&s;piratory
wheys, and &s;lops; and am amu&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;illy animadver&s;ions
&s;he is capable of making. I never knew her u&s;efulne&s;s till now; but I
<HI>now</HI> prefer her to <HI>all</HI> of <HI>her &s;tation.</HI> If I get
over this di&s;order, concerning which I have bad ap|prehen&s;ions, you may
depend upon &s;eeing me the fir&s;t Sunday I dare venture forth. I hope
<HI>you</HI> continue mending. The benefit of <HI>riding</HI> is only not
univer&s;al, and would cure <HI>me</HI> too, could I but make one previous
advance towards health. Have you tried cold bathing? Perhaps it may not &s;uit
your ca&s;e. I wi&s;h I had not dropt it. I take my fluctuation of nerves to be
cau&s;ed, as that of the &s;ea is, by wind; which I am continually pumping up,
and yet find it &s;till renewed. When I am ju&s;t &s;inking to &s;leep, a
&s;udden twitch of my nerves calls me back again&mdash;to watchfulne&s;s, and
vexation! I con&s;ider my&s;elf as in the &s;tate of the philo&s;opher, who
held a bullet betwixt his finger and thumb, which, whenever he was about to
nod, was ordered &s;o as to fall into a large bra&s;s pan, and 
<PB N="65" REF="78"> wake him&mdash;that he might pur&s;ue his
lucubra|tions.</P>
<P>I will mention one circum&s;tance regarding the weakne&s;s of my
nerves;&mdash;and not my &s;pi|rits, for I told you tho&s;e were
tolerable:&mdash;the lea&s;t noi&s;e that is, even the falling of a
fire-&s;hovel upon the floor, if it happen unexpected|ly, &s;hocks my whole
frame; and I actually be|lieve that a gun fired, behind my back, unawares,
amid&s;t the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, would go near to kill me with its
noi&s;e.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t going to bed; and dare not be any more attentive, as I
hope to clo&s;e my eyes for a minute. So fare you well!</P>
<P>It is now &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and I have had about five
hours middling &s;leep; which encourages me greatly: &s;o I will <HI>hope</HI>
to be able to &s;ee you next Sunday &s;evennight.</P>
<P>What think you of the battle? Are not you &s;o much in love with our
King, that you could find in your heart to &s;erve him in any profita|ble
po&s;t he might a&s;&s;ign you?</P>
<P>Capt. L&mdash; is wounded in the thigh.</P>
<P>When I ride in my chair round my neigh|bourhood, I am as much
&s;tared and wondered at, as a giant would be that &s;hould walk through
Pall-mall. My vehicle is at <HI>lea&s;t as</HI> uncommon hereabouts as a
blazing comet. My chief plea|&s;ure lies in finding out a thou&s;and roads, and
delightful little haunts near home, which I ne|ver dreamt of: egregious
&s;olitudes, and mo&s;t incomparable bye-lanes! where I can as effec|tually
lo&s;e my&s;elf within a mile of home, as if I were benighted in the de&s;arts
of Arabia. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 3, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not part from you without a <HI>great deal</HI> of melancholy.
To think of the <HI>&s;hort</HI> duration of tho&s;e interviews which are the
ob|jects of one's <HI>continual</HI> wi&s;hes, has been a reflec|tion that has
plagued me of old! I am &s;ure I returned home with it then, more aggravated as
I fore&s;aw my&s;elf returning to the &s;ame &s;eries of melancholy hours from
which you had a while relieved me, and which I had <HI>particularly</HI>
&s;uf|fered under all this la&s;t &s;pring! I wi&s;h to God, you might happen
to be &s;ettled not far from me: a day's-journey di&s;tance, however; I mean,
an <HI>ea&s;y</HI> one. But the odds are infinitely again&s;t me. I mu&s;t only
<HI>rely</HI> for my happine&s;s on the hopes of a never-cea&s;ing
corre&s;pondence!</P>
<P>Soon after you were gone, I received my packet. The hi&s;tory of
Worce&s;ter&s;hire is mere &s;tuff. T&mdash; I am &s;o fond of, that, I
believe, I &s;hall have his part of the collection bound over again, neatly and
&s;eparately. But &s;ure Hammond has no right to the lea&s;t <HI>inventive</HI>
merit, as the preface-writer would in&s;inuate. I do not think there is a
&s;ingle thought, of any eninence, that is not literally tran&s;lated. I am
a&s;toni&s;hed he could not content him&s;elf with be|ing &s;o little an
original.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttleton and his lady are at Hagley. A malignant caterpillar
has demoli&s;hed the beauty of all our <HI>large</HI> oaks. Mine are &s;ecured
by their littlene&s;s. But, I gue&s;s, the park &s;uf+fers; a large wood near
me being a mere win|ter-piece for nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, I give my&s;elf up to riding and thoughtle&s;sne&s;s;
being re&s;olved to make trial of <HI>their</HI> efficacy towards a tolerable
degree of health <PB N="67" REF="80"> and &s;pirits. I wi&s;h I had you for my
director. I &s;hould proceed with great confidence of &s;uc|ce&s;s; though I am
brought very low by two or three fits of a fever &s;ince I &s;aw you. Had I
written to you in the mid&s;t of my di&s;pirited condition, as I was going, you
would have had a more tender and unaffected letter than I <HI>can</HI> write at
another time: what I think, perhaps, at all times; but what &s;ickne&s;s can
alone elicit from a temper fearful of whining.</P>
<P>Surely the 
<Q REND="inline">"nunc formo&s;i&s;&s;imus annus"</Q> is to be
limited to hay-harve&s;t. I could give my rea|&s;ons: but you will imagine them
to be the acti|vity of country people in a plea&s;ing employ|ment; the full
verdure of the &s;ummer; the prime of pinks, woodbines, ja&s;mines, &amp;c. I
am old, very old; for few things give me &s;o much mechanical plea&s;ure as
lolling on a bank in the very heat of the &s;un, 
<Q> 
<L>When the old come forth to play</L> 
<L>On a &s;un-&s;hine holiday&mdash;</L></Q> And yet it is as much
as I can do to keep Mrs. Arnold from going to neighbouring hou&s;es in her
&s;mock, in de&s;pite of decency, and my known di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>I find my&s;elf more of a patriot than I ever thought I was. Upon
reading the account of the battle, I found a very &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, or,
as the Methodi&s;ts term it, perceived my heart <HI>enlarged,</HI> &amp;c. The
map you &s;ent me is a pretty kind of <HI>toy,</HI> but does not enough
particularize the &s;cenes of the war, &amp;c. which was the end I had in view
when I &s;ent for it.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"O dura me&s;&s;orum ilia!"</Q> About half the
appetite, dige&s;tion, &s;trength, &s;pirits, &amp;c. of a mower, would make me

in|&s;i&s;t upon it, that you ought to compound for the di&s;appointment you

as &s;oon as you can well &s;pare them. Let me know if they are &s;old

cannot afford to go to Bath pre|viou&s;ly to my London-journey; though I look
upon it as a proper method to make my re&s;i|dence in town more agreeable. I
&s;hall, probably, <PB N="69" REF="82"> be there about the fir&s;t of December;

<P>YOU may rea&s;onably have expected a letter before now, either as an
acknowledgment for your genteel pre&s;ent, or, at lea&s;t, by way of
information that I had received it. The prints have given me a plea&s;ure,
which, however con|&s;iderable, would &s;oon have langui&s;hed, if I had bought
them at a &s;hop; but which is now built upon the e&s;teem I have for the
giver, and can|not have a more durable foundation.&mdash;As for 
<PB N="70" REF="83"> the re&s;t, I am mo&s;t plea&s;ed with the view of
Matlock, and &s;hall have no peace of mind till I have &s;een the original. I
have been gilding the frames, and wi&s;hing all the while for your
com|pany.</P>
<P>I will alter the ballad according to your ad|vice; dividing it into
three parts, and adding a &s;tanza or two to the &s;horte&s;t, &s;ome time or
other. I have had no opportunity of trying the tunes. 
<Q REND="inline">"Arno's vale"</Q> has pretty words, and recommends
it&s;elf to one's imagination by the probability that it was written on a real
occa|&s;ion. The &s;imilitude of rhimes in the clo&s;e in|excu&s;able. For all
that has been the &s;ubject of my letter hitherto, as the country people &s;ay,
I can but thank you, and I do very &s;incerely; though as to the &s;ongs I will
repay you.</P>
<P>I have your poem by me, which I have read often with the greate&s;t
plea&s;ure. I have many ob&s;ervations to make; and only defer the
com|munication till I know whether you have a copy at Ti&s;&s;ington to turn
to. I think, the mo&s;t <HI>polite</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable</HI> title to it
would run:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"The Villa, a Poem; containing a Sketch of the
pre&s;ent Ta&s;te in Rural Embelli&s;hments, written in 1740."</Q> Your preface
has a pretty thought to|wards the clo&s;e; otherwi&s;e is on no account to be
admitted. Pardon my freedom; but, I think, there is no manner of occa&s;ion for
a pre|face; and tho&s;e &s;trokes, which I <HI>know</HI> to be real mode&s;ty
in <HI>you,</HI> the world will undoubtedly impute to affectation.&mdash;If you
give me encou|ragement, I will be very minute in my critici&s;ms, allowing you
to reject ten to one that you ad|mit of.</P>
<P>Whi&s;tler is gone to Bri&s;tol, and has bilked me.&mdash;I &s;aid,
he is gone; but, I believe, he is only upon going.&mdash;I linger at home, in
hopes of gleaning up a little health; and through a dread of being ill in a
place where I can be le&s;s <PB N="71" REF="84"> attended on.&mdash;I can
continually <HI>find out</HI> &s;ome|thing in my preceding diet that, I
<HI>think,</HI> di&s;or|ders me; &s;o that I am con&s;tantly in hopes of
growing well:&mdash;but, perhaps, I never &s;hall;

con&s;idering the im|mediate connexion betwixt that and health, and
endeavouring to promote it.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his park, in&s;cribed,

with &s;heeps' bones, jaws, &s;culls, &amp;c. fe&s;toon wi&s;e. In a nitch over
it, an owl.</P>
<P>As to &s;chemes, I have none with regard to the world, women, or
books. And I hate, and have deferred writing to you (for &s;ome days) for that
rea&s;on. I am &s;ick of exhibiting &s;o much &s;amene&s;s:&mdash;I am

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, my la&s;t letter to you was written before I
received yours from Ti&s;|&s;ington; and I &s;hould take &s;hame upon my&s;elf
for not an&s;wering it, were I not furni&s;hed with this excu&s;e&mdash;that I
waited for a frank for you.&mdash;There are but few things I have to &s;ay to
you, and &s;uch as are not worth tran&s;cribing; yet, as our di&s;tance from
one another requires it, I will &s;crawl them over as negligently as I can, to
let you &s;ee I lay no &s;tre&s;s upon them. A good ex|cu&s;e for lazine&s;s!
you will &s;ay: and lazy enough I am, God knows! I believe, any one who knows
me thoroughly will think, that there ne|ver was &s;o great an incon&s;i&s;tence
as there is betwixt my words (in my poem) and my actions.&mdash;This is what
the world calls hypocri&s;y, and is determined to look upon with
<HI>peculiar</HI> aver&s;ion. But, I think, the hypocrite is a
<HI>half</HI>-good cha|racter. A man certainly, con&s;idering the force 
<PB N="73" REF="88"> of precedent, de&s;erves &s;ome prai&s;e who keeps up
appearances; and is, no doubt, as much to be commended for talking better than
he acts, as he is to be blamed for acting wor&s;e than he talks. So much for
ca&s;ui&s;try. I would &s;eem, you mu&s;t know, to have &s;ome meritorious
views in talking <HI>virtuou&s;ly</HI>; but who does not know that every one
who writes poetry looks directly with his face towards prai&s;e, and whatever
el&s;e his eye takes in is viewed obliquely? Prai&s;e, as I &s;aid to
foible-confe&s;&s;ing W&mdash;, is the de|&s;ired, the noted, and the adequate
reward of poetry; in which &s;ort he that rewards me, Hea|ven reward him, as
Sir John Fal&s;taff &s;ays.&mdash;There is &s;omething very vain in repeating
my own &s;ayings; but I could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly u&s;e a joke to you which
I had u&s;ed in another letter, without owning it.&mdash;In &s;hort, it is
ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome <HI>earthly</HI> aim in view; the next world,
whether it be in reality near or far off, is always <HI>&s;een</HI> at a
di&s;tance. All that the generality of young people can do is, to act
<HI>con&s;i&s;tently with</HI> their expectations there.&mdash;Now, though
fame, &amp;c. be obviou&s;ly enough in the eye of rea&s;on di&s;&s;atisfactory;
yet it is pro|per enough to &s;uffer one's &s;elf to be deluded with the hopes
of it, that is, it is proper to cheri&s;h &s;ome worldly hopes, that one may
avoid impatience, &s;pleen, and one &s;ort of <HI>de&s;pair:</HI> I mean that
of having no <HI>hopes</HI> here, becau&s;e one &s;ees nothing here that
de&s;erves them. If I were in your ca&s;e, I would make all the efforts I was
able towards being a Bi&s;hop. That &s;hould be my earthly aim: not but I would
act with &s;o much indifference as to bear all di&s;appointment
unconcernedly&mdash;as, I dare &s;ay, you will.&mdash;There is but one
pa&s;&s;ion that I put upon an equally &s;prightly footing with ambition, and
that is love; which, as it <HI>regularly tends</HI> to ma|trimony, requires
certain favours from fortune <PB N="74" REF="89"> and circum&s;tance to render
it proper to indulge in.&mdash;By this time you think me crazed&mdash;as it
often happens to me to doubt, <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> whether I am not: but if
it be the 
<Q REND="inline">"mentis grati&s;&s;imus error,"</Q> I do not mind.
You are very oblig|ing to endeavour to continue my madne&s;s and
vanity.&mdash;I &s;hould be as glad to &s;ee Mr. Graves, your brother, as any
one I know: I live in a manner wherein he would find many things to exerci&s;e
his good nature.</P>
<P>Pamela would have made one good volume: I wonder the author, who has
&s;ome <HI>nice</HI> natu|ral &s;trokes, &s;hould not have &s;en&s;e enough to
&s;ee that.&mdash;I beg you will collect all the hints, &amp;c. of your own, or
others, that you think may tend to the improvement of my poem again&s;t winter;
that you would mention any flat lines, &amp;c.&mdash;Write me word &s;ome time

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are upon very <HI>good</HI> terms with me, and <HI>have</HI>
been all along. I gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;es of your &s;ilence, and have been
&s;incerely &s;orry for them; not however that I did not believe you were more

able to turn him&s;elf for money-bags.&mdash;I am <PB N="75" REF="90"> really

from Bir|mingham. I indulge my&s;elf in this expence, becau&s;e they &s;hall

&s;hould be burthen&s;ome to you. I will &s;end my hor&s;es to H&mdash;, and
lodge there, or &s;omewhere. But I am perfectly impatient to unbo&s;om my

<P>My ballad, in the mid&s;t of your hurry, mu&s;t appear as ridiculous

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>About 1745.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is not a &s;yllable you tell me con|cerning your&s;elf in your
la&s;t letter, but what applied to <HI>me</HI> is mo&s;t literally true. I am
&s;en&s;ible of the daily progre&s;s I make towards in &s;ignificancy, and it
will not be many years before you &s;ee me arrived at the <HI>ne plus
ultra.</HI> I believe it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to ac|quire a
con&s;iderable degree of knowledge, tho' I can under&s;tand things well enough
at the time I read them. I remember a preacher at St. Ma|ry's (I think it was
Mr. E&mdash;) made a notable di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>apprehen&s;ion</HI> and
<HI>comprehen&s;ion.</HI> If there be a real difference, probably it may find a
place in the explication of my genius. I envy you a good <HI>general</HI>
in&s;ight into the writings of the learned. I mu&s;t aim at nothing higher than
a well concealed ignorance.&mdash;I was think|ing, upon reading your letter,
<HI>when</HI> it was that you and Mr. Whi&s;tler and I went out of the road of
happine&s;s. It certainly was where we fir&s;t deviated from the turnpike road
of life.&mdash;Wives, children, alliances, vi&s;its, &amp;c. are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
objects of our &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions; and whe|ther or no we can, through
particular circum|&s;tances, be happy <HI>with,</HI> I think it plain enough
that it is not po&s;&s;ible to be happy <HI>without</HI> them. All attachments
to inanimate beauties, to curio|&s;ities, and ornaments, &s;atiate us
pre&s;ently.&mdash;The fanciful tribe has the di&s;advantage to be natu|rally
prone to err in the choice of <HI>la&s;ting</HI> plea|&s;ures: and when our
pa&s;&s;ions have habitually wandered, it is too difficult to reduce them into
their proper channels. When this is the ca&s;e, nothing but the change or
variety of amu&s;ements &s;tands any chance to make us ea&s;y, and it is not 
<PB N="78" REF="93"> long ere the whole &s;pecies is exhau&s;ted.&mdash;I agree
with you entirely in the nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>&s;ociable</HI> life in order
to be happy. I do not think it much a paradox, that any company is better than
<HI>none.</HI> I think it obvious enough as to the pre|&s;ent hour, and as to
any future influence, &s;oli|tude has exceeding &s;avage effects on our
di&s;po|&s;itions.&mdash;I have wrote out my elegy: I lay no manner of
&s;tre&s;s but upon the piety of it.&mdash;Would it not be a good kind of
motto, applied to a per&s;on you know, that might be taken from what is &s;aid
of <HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>I tell thee, faithle&s;s prie&s;t!</L> 
<L>A mini&s;tring angel &s;hall Ophelia be</L> 
<L>When thou art howling.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have amu&s;ed my&s;elf often with this &s;pecies of writing
&s;ince you &s;aw me; partly to divert my pre&s;ent <HI>impatience,</HI> and
partly as it will be a picture of mo&s;t that pa&s;&s;es in my mind; a
por|trait which <HI>friends</HI> may value.&mdash;I &s;hould be glad of your
profile: if you have objections, I drop my reque&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hould be
heartily glad if you would come and live with me, for any &s;pace of time that
you could find convenient.&mdash;But I will depend on your coming over with Mr.
Whi&s;tler in the &s;pring. I may po&s;&s;ibly take a jaunt towards you ere
long: the road would furni&s;h me out &s;ome vi&s;its; and, by the time I
reached you, perhaps, afford me a kind of cli|max of happine&s;s. If I do not,
I &s;hall perhaps be a little time at Bath. I do not &s;peak of this la&s;t as
a &s;cheme from which I entertain great expectations of plea&s;ure. It is long
&s;ince I have con&s;idered my&s;elf as <HI>undone.</HI> The <HI>world</HI>
will not perhaps con&s;ider me in that light entirely, till I have married my
maid. Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY life, for aught I &s;ee, will pa&s;s away ju&s;t as it
<HI>has</HI> done, without introducing &s;ufficient improvement into my
circum&s;tances to give a chearful ca&s;t to my corre&s;pondence. In
<HI>one</HI> re&s;pect, in regard to my inviolable friend|&s;hip for
<HI>you,</HI> I hope you will hear with &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that I continue
&s;till the &s;ame. And this kind of <HI>idenity,</HI> I think, I could
promi&s;e you, though every circum&s;tance in my fortune, every particle of my
body, were changed; and others, ever &s;o heterogeneous, &s;ub&s;tituted in
their place. After this, it would be no com|pliment to &s;ay, that the
<HI>pretended</HI> heir to the&s;e kingdoms could not alter it, were he to
&s;ubvert the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; which mu&s;t, out of all doubt, be the
con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;s. The rebellion, you may gue&s;s, is the
&s;ubject of all conver&s;ation. Every individual nailer here takes in a
news-paper (a more <HI>pregnant</HI> one by far than any of the London ones),
and talks as familiarly of <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>princes</HI> as ever Ma&s;ter
Shallow did of John Gaunt. Indeed it is no bad thing that they do &s;o; for I
cannot con|ceive that the people want &s;o much to be con|vinced by

'&s;quire, and every country clerk, and Sam Shaw the taylor, &s;eem to be as
much ma&s;ters of them as the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves. I mu&s;t not &s;ay we

the be&s;t of any &s;ermon on this occa|&s;ion. He gives his audience a view of

po&s;&s;ibly doubt of, when fairly &s;tated: and, I own, I cannot &s;ee one
&s;ingle <HI>good</HI> it could produce, in compen&s;ation for its inevita|ble

<P>I have often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your country this winter.
Some kind of pilgrimage I mu&s;t make, to avoid a lethargy.&mdash;Public places
I want to vi&s;it a little; to peep at and renew my ideas of the

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1746, ineunte anno.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;|agree with you on any
other &s;core, than the &s;canty pittances you allot me of your compa|ny; and,
if I have di&s;clo&s;ed any &s;ymptoms of re&s;entment on that account, you
will, perhaps, overlook them, out of regard to the motive from which they
proceeded.&mdash;I thank you for your peru&s;al of that trivial poem. If I were
going to print it, I &s;hould give way to your remarks <HI>implicitly,</HI> and
would not <HI>dare</HI> to do other|wi&s;e. But &s;o long as I keep it in
manu&s;cript, you will pardon my &s;illy prejudices, if I chu&s;e to read and
&s;hew it with the addition of mo&s;t of my new &s;tanzas. I own, I have a
fondne&s;s for &s;everal, imagining them to be <HI>more</HI> in Spen&s;er's
way, yet more independent on the antique <PB N="82" REF="97"> phra&s;e, than
any part of the poem; and, on that account, I cannot yet prevail on my&s;elf to
bani&s;h <HI>them</HI> entirely; but were I to print, I &s;hould (with
<HI>&s;ome</HI> reluctance) give way to your &s;entiments (which I know are
ju&s;t), namely, that they render the work too diffu&s;e and flim&s;y, and
&s;eem rather excre&s;cences than e&s;&s;ential parts of it.</P>
<P>But of the&s;e things I &s;ay no more now. I purpo&s;e &s;taying a
month with Mr. Whi&s;tler in December, if it &s;uits him; and then I hope I
&s;hall have a great deal of your company. Let me hear &s;omething in your next
of your <HI>dome&s;tic affairs.</HI> I beg you would not make any grand
deci&s;ion, without giving me &s;ome previous in|formation. I e&s;teem this as
due to the friend|&s;hip I have &s;o long profe&s;&s;ed for you, and from the
friend&s;hip you have &s;o long profe&s;&s;ed for me.</P>
<P>I look upon the death of the two Lords as equally decent upon their
re&s;pective principles. Lord Kilmarnock, I &s;uppo&s;e, joined the rebels
through a view of bettering his circum&s;tances, con&s;cious to him&s;elf that
he was guilty of a crime the moment he did &s;o. This is agreeable to his
&s;peech before the Lords, and to that me|lancholy which he di&s;covered upon
the &s;caffold. Death, aggravated by guilt, would &s;it heavier upon him than
upon the other, even &s;uppo&s;ing him to have had the &s;ame re&s;olution.
Balme|rino's life was quite <HI>unie,</HI> and his death equal to the character
he aimed at. We are to ob&s;erve, that he meant to &s;uffer as a Friend to the
Stu|arts, a Soldier, and a Scot&s;man. The fir&s;t he manife&s;ted when he came
out of the Tower, by his reply of 
<Q REND="inline">"God &s;ave King J&mdash;s;"</Q> the &s;econd, by
his dre&s;s, and numberle&s;s o&s;tentations of in|trepidity; the la&s;t, by
his plaid night-cap. Did you hear the &s;tory of his &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to
Lord Kilmarnock? 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had been practi&s;ing <PB N="83" REF="98">
how to lye upon the block, and had found out, the ea&s;ie&s;t way of receiving
the blow was, to bite his tongue hard: or even if he bit it off, it was no
matter, they &s;hould have no farther u&s;e for it."</Q> His behaviour &s;eems
to have wanted coolne&s;s, or el&s;e to equal that of Adrian, Cato, Sir T.
More, &amp;c. or any of tho&s;e heroes who had &s;pirit enough to make an
o&s;tentation of their unconcern. I had, from the printed accounts of their
behaviour, an idea of their per&s;ons, exactly con&s;ormable to the
de|&s;cription I read afterwards in your paper;&mdash;but enough&mdash;you
&s;end me &s;terling matters of fact, and I return you tin&s;el

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately received a letter from Mr. Whi&s;tler, which conveys
your compliments to me, and, by &s;o doing, prompts me to ac|knowledge the
receipt of your last kind letter. I ob&s;erve you adhere &s;trictly to the
apo&s;tolical precept of being 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;wift to <HI>hear,</HI> &s;low to
<HI>&s;peak</HI>;"</Q> the latter part of which I would fain conclude you
under&s;tand too literally.</P>
<P>Your neighbour, I &s;ee, is not a little embar|ra&s;&s;ed with his
mills at Whitchurch. I have long had an eye upon his adverti&s;ement in the
London Evening Po&s;t, and been not a little &s;can|dalized thereat. What has
the name of a poet to do with the publication of lands and tene|ments? or the
idea of harmony with the noi&s;e of a water-mill? yet has he extracted mu&s;ic
from the &s;ubject, and mirth from his mi&s;for|tunes; having &s;ent me a
ballad upon the miller, written with much ea&s;e and &s;ome drollery.</P>
<P>As to the light in which you place your pre|&s;ent fortunes, I can
only &s;ay, that you have not that &s;ituation I could wi&s;h you for your
<HI>own &s;ake:</HI> for &s;o far as <HI>I</HI> am concerned in your
ele|vation, I can a&s;&s;ure you very faithfully, that no circum&s;tances in
the world could more endear you to my affection, or recommend you to my
re&s;pect, than the pre&s;ent. My <HI>affection,</HI> you will ea&s;ily
ob&s;erve, from the very <HI>nature</HI> of affec|tion in general, would
&s;tand no chance to be increa&s;ed by your promotion; and as for re&s;pect, if
I knew the degree you de&s;ired, I would ac|quit my&s;elf of it to your
&s;atisfaction <HI>now</HI>; and were you &s;ettled at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> I
&s;hould expect that you would require no <HI>more</HI> from me upon that 
<PB N="85" REF="100"> account; at lea&s;t in private: &s;o that, &s;o far as
either <HI>deference</HI> or <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> is concerned, you are an
Archbi&s;hop to <HI>me</HI> to all intents and pur|po&s;es.&mdash;As to figure
in the world, it depends much, I know, upon advancement; and yet even here you
will be ever <HI>&s;ure</HI> of that kind of weight which ingenuity gives;
di&s;cernable to the <HI>&s;maller</HI> indeed, but undoubtedly the more
<HI>valuable</HI> part of the world;&mdash;but this is impro|per, as it is
<HI>philo&s;ophy,</HI> and as it is <HI>advice;</HI> neither of which is it
&s;uitable for me to &s;ugge&s;t to you&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Alcinoo Poma, &amp;c."</Q> As to the long &s;eries

of them. It is a &s;ubject, to tell you the truth, on which you cannot reply
with|out &s;ome danger of hurting me.&mdash;As for poli|tics (you will blame
this letter for dwelling &s;o much upon the &s;ubject of yours;) but as for
politics, I think <HI>poets</HI> are <HI>tories</HI> by nature, &s;up|po&s;ing
them to be by nature poets.&mdash;The love of an individual per&s;on or family,
that has worn a crown for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, is an inclination greatly
adapted to the fanciful tribe. On the other hand, mathematicians,
ab&s;tract-rea&s;oners, of no manner of attachment to per&s;ons, at lea&s;t to
the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> part of them, but prodigiou&s;ly de|voted to the ideas
of virtue, liberty, and &s;o forth, are generally <HI>whigs.</HI> It happens
agreea|bly enough to this maxim, that the whigs are friends to that wi&s;e,
plodding, unpoetical people the Dutch.&mdash;The Tories, on the other hand, are
taken mightily with that &s;hewy, o&s;tentatious nation the French. Foxhunters,
that re&s;ide among&s;t the beauties of nature, and bid defiance to art, in
&s;hort, that have intellects of a poeti|cal <HI>turn,</HI> are frequently
tories; citizens, mer|chants, &amp;c. that &s;carce &s;ee what nature is, and
con&s;equently have no preten&s;ions to a poetical ta&s;te, are, I think,
generally argumentative and whiggi&s;h;&mdash;but perhaps I carry this too
far.&mdash;<PB N="86" REF="101"> Something there is in it however, you will
&s;ee: not that I would apply what I here &s;ay to par|ticular revolutions,
&amp;c. I would only advance &s;omething general and &s;peculative. Nor would I
approve or condemn by this any one &s;et of people now exi&s;ting. Nor would I
have you pretend to fi&s;h out my party from any thing I have &s;aid; for I am
of none.&mdash;The letter I &s;ent you la&s;t was <HI>occa&s;ional,</HI> and
when I &s;ee you I will tell you the occa&s;ion. I ab&s;olutely agree with you
in every tittle of your political ob&s;ervations.&mdash;I am glad I do; for I
know the poi&s;onous nature of party: and though we are <HI>neither</HI>
vio|lent, yet I &s;hould fear it. My &s;chemes are <HI>doubtful</HI> at
pre&s;ent, but my face is &s;et towards Bath.&mdash;I am confident of the
&s;ervice tho&s;e wa|ters would do me.&mdash;I hope you will exhilarate me with
a letter &s;oon.&mdash;I would fain have fur|ni&s;hed out a letter to amu&s;e

<P>THOUGH I feel an irre&s;i&s;tible propen|&s;ity to write to you this
very po&s;t, yet I cannot &s;ay that I am able to advance any thing tending
either to your own or my &s;atisfaction.&mdash;What is wor&s;t of all is, I
cannot fix the time of &s;eeing you with &s;o much preci&s;ion as I would
always endeavour where my plea&s;ure is &s;o much concerned&mdash;I will tell
you the whole affair.&mdash;I <PB N="87" REF="102"> have for a long &s;ea&s;on
propo&s;ed to drink the Bath waters this &s;pring; and <HI>did</HI> think of
&s;et|ting out in a week's time, when I received your letter, purpo&s;ing to
&s;tay there a month; and from thence take a circuit which &s;hould indulge me
in a &s;ight of you, Mr. Whi&s;tler, and &s;ome few others in my way home. The
latter part of this &s;cheme (tho' far the more agreeable to me) was rather
doubtful and precarious; depending (as you expre&s;s it) on the &s;tate of my
finances after a month's continuance at Bath; which I con&s;idered, and
<HI>do</HI> con&s;ider, as a very probable means of bettering my
con&s;titution.&mdash;Now I covet to &s;ee you &s;o much, that I would bring
nothing but health in competition.&mdash;What I wi&s;h is, that you could, with
convenience, either <HI>ha&s;ten</HI> or <HI>delay</HI> your journey, that you
might find me before mine, or after my return, though I &s;hould infinitely,
and for many rea&s;ons, prefer the former. I long to talk with you particularly
now. I have much to &s;ay in regard to our friend's amour, to which you alluded
in your la&s;t. I reque&s;t it as a favour of you, that you would conjure him,
by the friend&s;hip I have ever borne him, and by any e&s;teem which he has
ever profe&s;&s;ed for me, that he would do nothing very <HI>material</HI> in
the affair till I have talked it over, and given him my faithful &s;en|timents,

<Q REND="inline">"quod cen&s;et amiculus."</Q></P>
<P>I am not willing the balance &s;hould turn en|tirely on the whig
&s;ide: I would give it a grea|ter equilibrium, if the following &s;ugge&s;tion
might effect it. Tories, I &s;aid, have great, and &s;ometimes partial
affections for the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of a king.&mdash;We will &s;uppo&s;e that
kings are alter|nately good and bad: their loyalty to the good one is
commendable; their partiality to the bad one not to be vindicated. Whigs have
<HI>no</HI> pa&s;|&s;ion, <HI>no</HI> gratitude, towards to the good prince:
there they are wrong. They are &s;evere upon the <PB N="88" REF="103"> bad one,
in which they are ju&s;tifiable. I wi&s;h I had not begun the&s;e whole&s;ale
di&s;tinctions, this mi&s;erable &s;pecimen of my politics. I pro|te&s;t
again&s;t all epi&s;tolary di&s;putes. I am now embarra&s;&s;ed in one, on much
&s;uch another &s;core, which fills up all my letter; for I love the la&s;t
word, like a &s;cold or a child.&mdash;I thank you for your little anecdotes
from time to time: you may depend upon it, that I have never heard any thing
<HI>before</HI>; for I never <HI>do</HI> hear any thing.&mdash;I am one very
thankful letter in debt to your neighbour Whi&s;tler. I have at pre&s;ent
nothing but the <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> of a good corre&s;pondent; but I will
write &s;oon. In the mean time, if you &s;ee him, a&s;k him if he goes to Bath
or Bri&s;tol this &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;I beg you would write to me di|rectly
<HI>when</HI> you can come, and how I may re|gulate my motions &s;o as to be
be&s;t a&s;&s;ured of &s;eeing you.&mdash;Pray do not neglect a po&s;t. I

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now, I believe, near half a year &s;ince I had the favour of a
letter from you. When I wrote la&s;t, I di&s;covered a more than ordinary
&s;olicitude for <HI>one</HI> immediate an&s;wer. It puzzles me to account for
your unu&s;ual &s;ilence, other|wi&s;e than upon &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;ome
offence you have taken: and it puzzles me as much to gue&s;s by what behaviour
of mine I have been &s;o un|happy as to give you that offence.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="104">I am vain enough to imagine that the little
merit I have, de&s;erves &s;omewhat more regard than I have met with from the
world. Be that as it will, the di&s;appointment I mu&s;t undergo, by any
<HI>appearance</HI> of neglect from the friends I value, would more effectually
di&s;pirit me than any other what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I have publi&s;hed my de&s;ign of vi&s;iting you, and Mr. Whi&s;tler
in Oxford&s;hire, to all the world. A thou&s;and incidents have hitherto
in|terfered with it, which I will not now recount. But when I look back upon
the regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of them, it looks as if De&s;tiny had &s;ome hand
in detaining me. The mo&s;t <HI>vigorous</HI> of my <HI>hopes</HI> dwell upon
&s;eeing you next win|ter, though I am not a little indulgent to
<HI>tho&s;e</HI> that tell me I may &s;ee you long before.</P>
<P>I have brought my place here to greater per|fection than it has ever
yet appeared in; and, with the <HI>mob,</HI> it is in &s;ome vogue.
Neverthe|le&s;s, I do not know that I ever reli&s;hed it le&s;s in my life than
I have done this &s;ummer. Bad health, bad &s;pirits, no company to my mind,
and no corre&s;pondences, are enough to bla&s;t the &s;weete&s;t &s;hades, and
to poi&s;on the pure&s;t fountains. Some of the&s;e misfortunes I can im|pute
to my own mi&s;conduct, and it embitters them. The two la&s;t I can le&s;s
account for, ha|ving at all times done all I was able to recom|mend my&s;elf to
my <HI>friends,</HI> behaving at the &s;ame time with courte&s;y to the re&s;t

<P>I AM under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that you dread the &s;ight of a
letter from me, as it &s;eems to lay claim to the compliment of an an&s;wer. I
will therefore write you one that &s;hall wave its <PB N="92" REF="107">
privilege, at lea&s;t till &s;uch time as your lei&s;ure encourages, or your
pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ipation does not forbid you to &s;end one.&mdash;I dare now
no longer expatiate upon the affair you have in hand; it is enough for me, if
you will excu&s;e the free|dom I <HI>have</HI> taken. I have often known
<HI>delay</HI> produce good effects in &s;ome ca&s;es which even &s;agacity
it&s;elf could not &s;urmount; and, if I thought I did not go too far, would
pre&s;ume to recommend it now. You know I have very little of the temper of an
alderman. I almo&s;t hate the <HI>idea</HI> of wealthine&s;s as much as the
<HI>word.</HI> It &s;eems to me to carry a notion of ful|ne&s;s, &s;tagnation,
and in&s;ignificancy. It is this di&s;po&s;ition of mine that can
<HI>alone</HI> give any weight to the advice I &s;end you, as it proves me not
to give it through any partiality to fortune. As to what remains, you are, I
hope, a&s;&s;ured of the value I mu&s;t ever have for you in <HI>any</HI>
circum|&s;tances, and the regard I &s;hall always &s;hew for any that belongs
to you. I cannot like you <HI>le&s;s</HI> or <HI>more.</HI>&mdash;I now drop
into other matters. Ber|gen, I &s;ee, is taken at lo&s;t; pray what are the
&s;entiments of your political companions? I dined &s;ome time ago with Mr.
Lyttelton and Mr. Pitt, who both agreed it was worth twenty thou&s;and men to
the French; which is a light in which I never u&s;ed to con&s;ider it. Any
little intimation that you plea&s;e to <HI>confer</HI> upon me, en|ables me to
&s;eem <HI>wi&s;e</HI> in this country for a month; particularly if I take care
to adju&s;t my face accordingly. As I was returning la&s;t Sun|day from church,
whom &s;hould I meet in my way, but that <HI>&s;weet-&s;ouled</HI> bard Mr.
James Thom|&s;on, in a chai&s;e drawn by two hor&s;es lengthways.&mdash;I
welcomed him into the country, and a&s;ked him to accompany Mr. Lyttelton to
the Lea&s;ows (who had offered me a vi&s;it) which he promi&s;ed to do. So I am
in daily expectations of them and all the world this week. I fancy they will 
<PB N="93" REF="108"> lavi&s;h all their prai&s;es upon <HI>nature,</HI>
re&s;erving none for poor <HI>art</HI> and <HI>me.</HI> But if I ever live, and
am able to perfect my &s;chemes, I &s;hall not de&s;pair of plea&s;ing the
&s;ew I fir&s;t began with; <HI>the few friends prejudiced in my favour,</HI>
and then 
<Q REND="inline">"Fico por los malignatores."</Q> Cen&s;ures will not
affect me; for I am armed &s;o &s;trong in <HI>va|nity,</HI> that they will
pa&s;s by me as the idle wind which I regard not. I think it pretty near equal,
in a country place, whether you gain the &s;mall number of ta&s;ters, or the
<HI>large crowd</HI> of the vul|gar. The latter are more frequently met with,
and <HI>gape, &s;tupent,</HI> and <HI>&s;tare</HI> much more. But one would
chu&s;e to plea&s;e a few <HI>friends</HI> of ta&s;te before mob or gentry, the
great vulgar or the &s;mall; becau&s;e therein one gratifies both one's
&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions and one's pride, that is, one's <HI>&s;elf</HI>-love.
Above all things, I would wi&s;h to plea&s;e <HI>you;</HI> and if I have a
wi&s;h that projects or is pro|minent beyond the re&s;t, it is to &s;ee you
placed to your &s;atisfaction near me; but Fortune mu&s;t vary from her u&s;ual
treatment before &s;he favours me &s;o far.&mdash;And yet there <HI>was</HI> a
time, when one might probably have prevailed on her. I knew not what to
do&mdash;The affair was &s;o intricately circum&s;tanced&mdash;your
&s;urprizing &s;ilence after the hint I gave.&mdash;Mr. D&mdash; offering to
&s;erve any friend of mine; nay, pre&s;&s;ing me to u&s;e the
op|portunity.&mdash;His other relations, his guardians, teizing him with &s;ure
&s;ymptoms of a rupture in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al on <HI>their</HI>
&s;ide.&mdash;Mr P&mdash; &s;olicit|ing me if the place were <HI>&s;old,</HI>
which it could not legally be. Friend&s;hip, propriety, imparti|ality,
&s;elf-intere&s;t (which I <HI>little</HI> regarded) endea|vouring to
di&s;tract me; I think I never &s;pent &s;o di&s;agreeable an half-year &s;ince
I was born. To clo&s;e the whole, I could not <HI>fore&s;ee</HI> the event,
which is almo&s;t foretold in your la&s;t letter, and I knew I could not

me know about a fortnight &s;ince, that I had more lei&s;ure than him; and
&s;ince it did not &s;uit his convenience to come, I ought to take the
opportunity of vi&s;iting him, and &s;eeing Derby&s;hire while he continues in
it.&mdash;W&mdash; has not wrote to me the&s;e &s;ix weeks.&mdash;Outing has
been, moreover, dumb for the &s;ame &s;pace of time; and I purpo&s;e in my
heart to behave with &s;ome di&s;tance toward both, for this neglect (&s;ee my
rule of circum&s;tantial evi|dence).</P>
<P>It is a pity you cannot &s;pare a day or two to come and &s;ee me.
My wood grows exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ant, and its plea&s;antne&s;s vexes me;
becau&s;e nobody will come that can ta&s;te it.</P>
<P>Your health, according to your de&s;cription, is much the &s;ame
with mine; but from the gaiety of your &s;tyle and <HI>de&s;igns,</HI> I
collect that it is greatly better.</P>
<P>I have an alcove, &s;ix elegies, a &s;eat, two epi|taphs (one upon
my&s;elf), three ballads, four &s;ongs, and a &s;erpentine river, to &s;hew you
when you come. Will the compo&s;itions come &s;afe to you, if I &s;end my book,
which contains the <HI>only</HI> copies of &s;everal things (which I could not
re|member if they were lo&s;t)?&mdash;but I will not &s;end them. If my hor&s;e
gets well, I may e&s;&s;ay a vi&s;it for two days, and bring them with me, that
I may make comments while you read them, as be&s;eemeth a genuine author to
do.</P>
<P>I am rai&s;ing a green-hou&s;e from the excre&s;cen|ces of Lord
Dudley's; but I do not find that <PB N="96" REF="111"> 
<Q REND="inline">"vient l'appetit en mangeant,"</Q> that I grow
fonder of my collection proportionable as it in|crea&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think my&s;elf fortunate enough at pre|&s;ent, if, like
you, I could only find that I had been mentioned for a vacant po&s;t; but I
have withdrawn all my views from court-preferment, and fixed them on finding a
pot of money, which I determine to be the far more probable &s;cheme.</P>
<P>I have little health and frequent mortification, &s;o that no one
need envy me; and yet, I be|lieve, there <HI>are</HI> that do Are any enviable
but &s;uch as are unambitious? I never &s;hall be able to reckon my&s;elf of

and left the re&s;t of the world nothing but hopes and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions.
Yet I do not much feel the pains of am|bition, while I am conver&s;ing with
ingenious friends of my own level: but in <HI>other</HI> company it hurts me.
Let me advi&s;e you, now I think of it, to dread the company of &s;illy people,

<P>As I was returning from church on Sunday la&s;t, whom &s;hould I
meet in a chai&s;e, with two hor&s;es lengthways, but that right friendly bard,
Mr. Thomp&s;on? I complimented him upon his arrival in this country, and
a&s;ked him to accom|pany Mr. Lyttelton to The Lea&s;ows, which he &s;aid he
would with abundance of plea&s;ure; and &s;o we parted. You will ob&s;erve,

<HI>di&s;cover</HI> to you, the more &s;ub&s;tantial is my apology for
deferring mine into Warwick&s;hire. I own, I am plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect
of &s;hewing them &s;omething at The Lea&s;ows beyond what they ex|pect. I have
begun my terras on the high hill I &s;hewed you, made &s;ome con&s;iderable
improve|ments in Virgil's grove, and fini&s;hed a walk from it to the hou&s;e,
after a manner which you will approve. They are going to build a ca&s;tle in
the park round the lodge, which, if well exe|cuted, mu&s;t have a good effect;
and they are going likewi&s;e to build a rotund to terminate the vi&s;to. The
fault is, that they anticipate every thing which I propo&s;e to do when I
become <HI>rich</HI>; but as that is never likely to be, perhaps it is not of
any importance;&mdash;but what I term <HI>rich,</HI> im|plies no great deal; I

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday, Feb. 14, 1747-8.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM tempted once more to apologize for the the un&s;ea&s;onable
vi&s;it I paid you, though I feel my&s;elf entirely innocent in that re&s;pect,
even as much as the po&s;t-boy was guilty; for had my previous letter arrived
in due time, you had then been furni&s;hed with an opportunity of waving my
company till a more convenient &s;ea&s;on. I was <HI>only,</HI> or, at lea&s;t,
<HI>chiefly</HI> unea&s;y upon <HI>your</HI> ac|count. I &s;pent my time very
agreeably, and only le&s;s &s;o than I might, had I not been con|&s;cious to
my&s;elf, that I was intruding upon do|me&s;tic tenderne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the Sunday night and the next day at Mr. Wren's; and am
now ju&s;t returned from Mr. Dolman's, who has made me a genteel pre&s;ent of
Spence's Polymetis. I have not yet <HI>read</HI> many dialogues in it, but I
have <HI>dipped</HI> in &s;everal; and have rea&s;on to be well enough
&s;atisfied with the &s;imple and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced
Mr. Lowth's poem. I have long <PB N="102" REF="117"> known of this intended
<HI>introduction</HI> (which I acci|dentally found to have to have been
&s;ettled be|twixt them before I publi&s;hed <HI>mine</HI> on the &s;ame
&s;ubject), and a little dreaded the <HI>form</HI> of it. I have long ago made
con&s;iderable improvements in mine, and have a mind one day to publi&s;h it
once more; after which, let it &s;leep in peace. I have &s;ometimes thought of
printing my next title-page thus, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"Poems; con&s;i&s;ting of Songs, Odes, and Elegies,
with an improved edition of The Judgment of Hercules, and of The
Shool-mi&s;tre&s;s."</Q> But I have but very few critical acquaintance, and I
live at a great di&s;|tance from tho&s;e I have; &s;tationed among&s;t the
<HI>makers</HI> and the <HI>wearers</HI> of hob-nails; 
<Q> 
<L>Far from the joys that with my &s;oul agree,</L> 
<L>From <HI>wit,</HI> from <HI>learning</HI>&mdash;very far from
thee.</L> 
<BIBL>PARNELL.</BIBL></Q> I know I have thrown a great number of
care|le&s;s things into your hands. I know to <HI>whom</HI> I intru&s;ted my
follies; but I know <HI>not</HI> what they <HI>are:</HI>&mdash;I believe, in
general, that they con&s;i&s;t of mis-begotten embryos and abortive births,
which it had been merely decent to have buried in&mdash;&s;ome part of my
garden; but I was morally a&s;&s;ured, that you would expo&s;e nothing of mine
to my di&s;advantage. As to &s;ome that are <HI>le&s;s im|perfect,</HI> you
promi&s;ed your ob&s;ervations, and I de&s;ire you would make them with the
utmo&s;t freedom. I can bear any cen&s;ure which you &s;hall pa&s;s by way of
letter, and I beg once more that you would not be &s;paring. It will be
e&s;teemed as great a favour as you can do me. When they have gone through your
hands, and tho&s;e of one or two more friends, I &s;hall, per|haps, think of
publi&s;hing them; though as to that, much depends upon the advice I receive,
and previou&s;ly on the opportunity I have of re|ceiving. <PB N="103" REF="118"> I am in hopes that you will be pretty full in di&s;covering to me,
<HI>which you di&s;like the lea&s;t, what faults you find,</HI> and <HI>what
improvements they are capable of.</HI> I &s;et you a tedious ta&s;k; but I will
return the favour as far as I am able, either in the <HI>&s;ame way</HI> or any
other. This brings me to &s;ay, that, if there be any compo&s;itions of yours
that you would have me to correct (and there are &s;everal of which I want a
copy), I would beg you to &s;end them. Your Blackbird excels any &s;inging-bird
I ever heard, and I be&s;eech you to convey it to The Lea&s;ows by the next
opportu|nity, that he may acquire &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">me near other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ills, and
in other valleys, than tho&s;e in which he was produced.&mdash;I have many
compliments to make in your country; to Mr. H&mdash;, Mrs. N&mdash;, Mrs.
J&mdash;, Mr. F&mdash;, Mr. T&mdash;, and your brother. If I go over to Mr.
W&mdash;'s, I will a&s;&s;uredly call and &s;pend a night with
you.&mdash;<HI>That</HI> is precarious.&mdash;But whether I do or not, I would
willingly hope to &s;ee you this &s;pring and &s;ummer more than once; as a
<HI>critic</HI> and as a <HI>friend:</HI> nor do I forget the promi&s;e of Mr.
H&mdash; and Mr. F&mdash;;&mdash;but of the&s;e things more when I &s;end for
the papers, which I purpo&s;e to do to-morrow fortnight, that is, the
twenty-ninth of February.</P>
<P>I have &s;uffered greatly by railing at the black button on a
par&s;on's great coat. Had Mr. Hall's been thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, he could not
have mi&s;|taken mine for his own; which latter I &s;ent in order to be
commuted at Birmingham, and was almo&s;t &s;tarved to death before I could
accompli&s;h the exchange. There is no trifling with any <HI>part</HI> of
orthodoxy with impunity.&mdash;That is the moral.</P>
<P>I have received a very obliging letter from Lady Luxborough, wherein
&s;he tells me, that Lady Hartford admires my place in her de&s;crip|tion. Mr.
Thom&s;on is intimate at Lady Hart|ford's; and I &s;uppo&s;e Lady Hartford may
have <PB N="104" REF="119"> been informed by L. L. that Mr. Thom&s;on has been
here; &s;o I conclude, in mere vanity, that my farm is advancing in
reputation.</P>
<P>What think you of Mr. Carte's Hi&s;tory? or what of his narrative
concerning the Pretender's touching for the King's evil? I think one is not,
however, to give up his book entirely; becau&s;e, with <HI>all his
&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> he may have &s;everal anec|dotes that one would like to
read.</P>
<P>I have had great expectations from the beau|tiful veins of a piece
of oak of which I have had a table made; but, upon a thorough &s;urvey of it,
it is &s;o like nothing in the world as old B&mdash;'s callimanco
night-gown..</P>
<P>I have nothing to add worth beginning upon another page; but I
happened not to make a re|gular conclu&s;ion in my preceeding one.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t give me &s;ome time to colour you a collection of flowers
(that octavo edition I &s;hewed you here); and then I will make Mrs. Jago a
pre&s;ent of it. I believe I can engage Mr. Dolman to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, who is
much my &s;uperior in point of accuracy; and the in&s;cription at the beginning
is to run &s;omehow thus: 
<Q> ELEGANTISSIMAE PVELLAE <LB>DOROTHEA FANCOVRT, <LB>QVAE PERDILECTI

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;ent Tom over for the papers which I left under your
in&s;pection; have nothing to to add upon this head, but that the more
<HI>freely</HI> and <HI>particularly</HI> you give me your opinion, the greater
will be the obligation which I &s;hall have to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very glad, if I happen to receive a good large bundle
of your own compo&s;itions; in regard to which, I will ob&s;erve any commands
which you &s;hall plea&s;e to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I am favoured with a certain corre&s;pondence, by way of letter,
which I told you I &s;hould be glad to cultivate; and I find it very
entertaining.</P>
<P>Pray did you receive my an&s;wer to your la&s;t letter, &s;ent by
way of London? I &s;hould be ex|tremely &s;orry to be debarred the plea&s;ure
of writing to you by the po&s;t, as often as I feel a violent propen&s;ity to
de&s;cribe the notable inci|dents of my life; which amount to about as much as
the tin&s;el of your little boy's hobby|hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I am on the point of purcha&s;ing a couple of bu&s;ts for the niches
in my hall; and believe me, my good friend, I never proceed one &s;tep in
or|namenting <PB N="106" REF="121"> my little farm, but I enjoy the hopes of
rendering it more agreeable to you, and the &s;mall circle of acquaintance, who
&s;ometimes favour me with their company.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be extremely glad to &s;ee you and Mr. Fancourt when the
trees are green; that is, in May; but I would not have you content your|&s;elf
with a &s;ingle vi&s;it this &s;ummer. If Mr. Hardy (to whom you will make my
compli|ments) inclines to favour me &s;o far, you mu&s;t calculate &s;o as to
wait on him whenever he finds it convenient; though I have <HI>better
hopes</HI> of mak|ing his reception here agreeable to him when my Lord Dudley
comes down.&mdash;I wonder how he would like the &s;cheme I am upon, of
exchanging a large tankard for a &s;ilver &s;tandi&s;h.</P>
<P>I have had a couple of paintings given me &s;ince you were here. One
of them is a Madona, valued, as it is &s;aid, at ten guineas in Italy, but
which you would hardly purcha&s;e at the price of five &s;hillings. However, I
am endeavouring to make it out to be one of Carlo Maratt's, who was a fir&s;t

they have long been, and lie &s;cattered about my farm. The French have what

improvements; and the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> is, that I long to have you &s;ee
them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="124">I have not heard whether Mi&s;s&mdash;'s match

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. JAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HARDLY know whether it will be pru|dent in me to own, that I wrote
you a <HI>long letter</HI> upon the receipt of your la&s;t, which I now have

interlin|ings; yet, &s;uch as it was, it had wearied my at|tention, and given

and the invariable continuance of my affection and e&s;teem&mdash;I find by
your la&s;t obliging letter, that my machina|tions and devices are not entirely
private.&mdash;You knew of my draught of Hagley Ca&s;tle about the bigne&s;s of
a barley-corn; you knew of our in|tended vi&s;it to Lady Luxborough's; and I
mu&s;t add, Mr. Thomas Hall knew of my contrivance for the embelli&s;hment of
Mr. Hardy's hou&s;e. Nothing is there hid that &s;hall not be

Luxborough has &s;een Hagley Ca&s;tle in the origi|nal:&mdash;and as to my
de&s;ire that my draught might be &s;hewn to no <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;oul,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the ju&s;tice of your
excu&s;es. Mrs. Jago's pre|&s;ent circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;tances render her vi&s;it quite imprac|ticable, and yours I have
the &s;ame kind of rea&s;on to di&s;pen&s;e with; as I gue&s;s, that &s;he
could as &s;oon take a journey <HI>her&s;elf</HI> at this time, as bear that
<HI>you</HI> &s;hould.&mdash;But to &s;ay I was not greatly 
<PB N="113" REF="128"> mortified, would be doing my&s;elf the greate&s;t
inju&s;tice. <HI>Di&s;appointed</HI> I was, you may be &s;ure, to hear
excu&s;es; even as much as Sir John Fal|&s;taff, when Mr. Dombledon put him in
mind of <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ending him <HI>two</HI> and
<HI>thirty yards</HI> of &s;attin to make him a <HI>&s;hort</HI> cloak. And on
the whole, I began to accu&s;e you and Mrs. Jago of <HI>colloguing</HI>
together, to fix your vi&s;it at a time when you were well a&s;&s;ured you
&s;hould have an <HI>apology</HI> to &s;end me in&s;tead. Now, if I &s;hould
pre&s;s this accu&s;ation, pray how would you evade the force of it?&mdash;The
next thing I am to &s;peak to, is your ver&s;es. I have made you my
ac|knowledgments <HI>before</HI>; and as you are &s;o good as to accept them, I
will not trouble you with addi|tional profe&s;&s;ions, or repetitions of the
pa&s;t. I will depend upon your good-&s;en&s;e for an excu&s;e, if I only add
what I think proper as to any <HI>alter|ation;</HI> wherein I have a view to
<HI>your</HI> credit, as my <HI>own.</HI> I confe&s;s, it requires &s;ome
nicety to in&s;cribe &s;uch an elegy as The Gold-finches with|out the danger
you fore&s;aw. But I think it <HI>may</HI> be done (and <HI>is</HI> pretty
nearly) in &s;uch manner as no man of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> will be tempted to
ridicule it; and as for the vulgar, of whatever <HI>rank</HI> they be, it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary many times to <HI>give them up. Ta&s;te</HI> and
<HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> are ab&s;olutely connected; and you may very readily call
to mind &s;ome charming things, that mu&s;t excite the laughter of your men of
<HI>fire</HI> and <HI>banter,</HI> but are by no means thought the wor&s;e of
by men of <HI>true genius.</HI> I will only mention Andrew Marvel's
<HI>Fawn</HI> in Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies. I inclo&s;e the elegy with &s;ome few
propo&s;ed alterations, &s;o I will not ri&s;que the <HI>&s;illing</HI> my
<HI>letter</HI> with critici&s;m. I al&s;o inclo&s;e the other ver&s;es you
&s;ent me, which I think good ones, and to &s;tand in need of little
alteration, be&s;ide that of the inglorious name at the head of them; to which,
notwith&s;tanding, I will never &s;ubmit. Pray who is the young gen|tleman 
<PB N="114" REF="129"> that tran&s;lates your elegy into Latin?&mdash;The new
dre&s;s will give you &s;ome amu&s;ement; and, if the&s;e lines <HI>be</HI> the
product of the genius of a boy of that age, he will in a year's time be able to
extend the &s;ame of your compo&s;itions. I &s;hall then be glad to &s;ee the
Gold finches under his hand; though I have no extraordinary fond|ne&s;s for the
Latin poetry of a modern; at lea&s;t, till your elde&s;t &s;on begins to
tran&s;late our ma|drigals.</P>
<P>I have not yet &s;een Mr. Thom&s;on's Ca&s;tle of Indolence.&mdash;I
waited for a &s;maller edition; but am now too impatient not to &s;end for it
on Thur&s;day next.&mdash;I am fully bent on rai&s;ing a neat urn to him in my
lower grove, if Mr. Lyttelton does not in&s;cribe one at Hagley <HI>before</HI>
me. But I &s;hould be extremely glad of your advice where|abouts to place
it.&mdash;You &s;peak of my dwelling in the Ca&s;tle of Indolence, and I verily
believe I <HI>do.</HI> There is &s;omething like enchantment in my pre&s;ent
inactivity; for, without any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of my
trifles that I &s;ee, I am in no wi&s;e able to make the leaft advances. I
think within my&s;elf I could pro|ceed if you were here; and yet I have
rea&s;on to believe, if you <HI>were</HI> here, we &s;hould only ramble round
the groves, and chat away the time; and perhaps <HI>that,</HI> upon the
<HI>whole,</HI> is of full as much importance.&mdash;I do not know but I do
my&s;elf &s;ome little inju&s;tice here, for I <HI>have</HI> wrote out my
<HI>levities,</HI> and my <HI>&s;onnets,</HI> good and bad, with many ornaments
from the pencil; and the next thing I do will be to tran&s;cribe my elegies.
The fault is, I take no pains to <HI>improve</HI> what I tran|&s;cribe, and,
con&s;equently, am only able to ex|hibit my non&s;en&s;e in a fairer
dre&s;s.&mdash;You mu&s;t give me leave, ere it be long, to in&s;ert two or
three lines (I think in <HI>ver&s;e</HI>) before Mrs. Jago's
flower-piece.&mdash;I am &s;ure, I am obliged to her for a fruit I greatly
love.&mdash;It was not entirely ripe; <PB N="115" REF="130"> but it was the

you may not receive the fir&s;t quarter's income of it this half year. He will
probably do &s;omething for you one time or other; but you &s;hall never go

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have not hitherto troubled you with a letter, I have not
been void either of <HI>inquiry</HI> or <HI>information,</HI> concerning the
&s;tate of your affairs, and of Mr. Hardy's health. Indeed it is now &s;everal
weeks &s;ince I collected &s;ome particulars from your brother, and I am now
impatient for further intelligence. As to the circum&s;tances of our friendly
reception at Wroxall, Mr. John Jago has probably enough acquainted you with
them. He <HI>would,</HI> however, &s;educe me to give you a di&s;tinct account;
being <PB N="125" REF="142"> a&s;&s;ured, as he &s;ays, that Mr. Wren's
behaviour mu&s;t afford a good &s;ubject for drollery. I do not know how far
this would be proper; but I think, when I write again to my friend Wren, to
give him a &s;ketch of his own character, ju&s;t as it appeared to us during
the time of our vi|&s;it. Perhaps it may avail a little. Amid&s;t his violent
pa&s;&s;ion for gardening, if he would but prune away &s;ome wild
excre&s;cences from one or two branches of his character, he might bring
him&s;elf to bear good fruit. He &s;hould <HI>weed</HI> his <HI>mind</HI> a
little; where there has &s;prung up a mo&s;t luxuriant crop of puns, that
threaten to choak all its whole&s;ome productions. 
<Q REND="inline">"Spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat."</Q> He has
good &s;en&s;e and good-nature; pity he &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e them.&mdash;Not
but that it is better to have the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> alone than the
<HI>forms alone,</HI> and &s;o I con|clude. Since I came home, I have done
little el&s;e than plant bu&s;hes, hazel hawthorn, crabtree, elder, &amp;c.
together with &s;ome flowering &s;hrubs that I have had given me, and &s;ome
that I have purcha&s;ed to the amount of twenty &s;hillings. I think nothing
remarkable has occurred; only, one mi&s;erable tempe&s;tuous day, I had my Lord
Stamford, who called to &s;ee my walks. My Lord promi&s;ed to come again in the
&s;ummer, and invited me more than once to Enville. By the way, he is now
building a Gothic green|hou&s;e by Mr. Miller's direction, and intends to build
ca&s;tles, and God-knows-what. By all ac|counts, the place is well worth
&s;eeing when you come in to the country, which I hope you will not fail to do
this &s;pring. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. Miller, in regard to
<HI>any</HI> ob&s;erva|tions I made in his walks. Remember there were a great
many things with which I was highly delighted; and forget that there were a few
al&s;o which I &s;eemed le&s;s to admire. Indeed, I thought it idle to regulate
my expre&s;&s;ions, among&s;t friends only, by the &s;ame rules which 
<PB N="126" REF="143"> I ought to ob&s;erve in mixed company. I &s;ay
<HI>ought,</HI> for <HI>he</HI> has been exceedingly favourable to <HI>me</HI>
in his repre&s;entation of the Lea&s;ows.&mdash;I hope to &s;ee Mr. Fancourt
with you, when you come this &s;pring; and why not your brother? he can &s;pend
half a week every now and then at Wroxal.</P>
<P>I have nothing to <HI>in&s;ert</HI> or <HI>inclo&s;e</HI> in this
letter that can render it at all agreeable.&mdash;I cannot <HI>write,</HI> I
cannot <HI>think.</HI> I can ju&s;t mu&s;ter up atten|tion enough to give
orders to my workmen; I &s;aunter about my grounds, take &s;nuff, and read
Clari&s;&s;a. This la&s;t part of my employment threatens to grow extremely
<HI>tedious:</HI> not but the author is a man of <HI>genius</HI> and <HI>nice
ob&s;ervation</HI>; but he might be le&s;s <HI>prolix.</HI> I will &s;end you 
<Q REND="inline">"The Life of Socrates"</Q> when I can get it home
from Barrels. I wi&s;h both your circum&s;tances and mine would allow of an
utter <HI>inattention</HI> to them; and then, I believe, our natural indo|lence
would be a kind of match for our ambi|tion. I &s;hall probably enlarge my
acquaintance this year; but what <HI>doth</HI> it? the circle of my friends
with whom I can be <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ed</HI> much, will continue
&s;mall as ever. I could dwell a good deal upon this &s;ubject; but I have only
room to de&s;ire you would give me your opinion how I &s;hould in&s;cribe my

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE my&s;elf obliged to you for procuring me the pictures.
I received them both very &s;afe, as I have a pretty &s;trong a&s;&s;urance I
<HI>&s;hall</HI> do mo&s;t articles of which my &s;ervant Tom has the
care.&mdash;He has punctuality and management to <HI>alone</HI> for his
<HI>imperfections.</HI> He brought me the&s;e paper-&s;culled bu&s;ts from
Wroxall entirely unhurt, contrary to the expec|tation of all that &s;aw them;
after which, he might undertake for almo&s;t any thing.&mdash;The por|trait is
undoubtedly a good one. I &s;hewed it to Mr. Smart (who is a painter him&s;elf,
though a clergyman), and he allowed as much; added al&s;o, that it had
&s;omething of Sir Godfrey Knel|ler, as well as of Sir Peter Lely.&mdash;The
flower-piece is very good, &s;o far as relates to the flow|ers; the dog and
parrot abominable, and the grapes very exceptionable. I never con&s;ider the
two flower-pieces at Icheneton with attention enough to cau&s;e a preference;
having never any thoughts that <HI>either</HI> would fall to my &s;hare. I
&s;hall add nothing with regard to your choice; but that I &s;incerely
<HI>hope</HI> yours is the better piece. I never heard of Ca&s;teels, I own;
nor can I find his name in any of my accounts of the painters, though they take
in pretty modern ones: but I can &s;ay this for your comfort, that if he
excelled in any thing, it was probably in flowers; for I &s;ee his name at the
bottom of tho&s;e flower-pieces that I have in water colours, as the de&s;igner
of them; and I think the de&s;igns are good. Though I could wi&s;h neither the
Cupid nor the fruit-piece had e&s;caped us, yet is there no blame to be laid at
your door; at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing <PB N="128" REF="145"> that you are endowed
with nothing more than rational conjecture, and that you are not gifted with
prophecy.</P>
<P>And now, having &s;poken, I think, to <HI>mo&s;t</HI> parts of your
letter, I proceed to &s;ay a word or two in the way of appendix. Fir&s;t then,
after five or &s;ix weeks work of ma&s;ons and carpenters, I plainly di&s;cover
that my hou&s;e is an unfini&s;hable thing;&mdash;and yet, I per&s;uade
my&s;elf, there will never be wanting a room in it, where you may &s;pend an
agreeable day with your undoubted friend.&mdash;Did I ever tell you how
<HI>un&s;ea&s;onably</HI> the three fiddles &s;truck up in my grove about an
hour after you left me; and how a &s;et of ten bells was heard from my wood the
evening after? It might have pa&s;&s;ed for the harmony of &s;ome aerial
&s;pirit, who was a well-wi&s;her to us poor mortals; but that I think, had it
been &s;o, it would have been addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>better &s;ort,</HI> and
of con&s;equence have been heard whil&s;t <HI>you</HI> were <HI>here.</HI> This
by way of introduction to what I am going to tell you. Mr. Pixell has made an
agree|ment with his club at Birmingham, to give me a day's mu&s;ic in &s;ome
part of my walks. The time is not yet fixed: but, if you were an idle man, and
could be brought over at a day or two's notice, I would give it you, and be in
hopes I could entertain you very agreeably.</P>
<P>You cannot think how much you gratified my vanity when you were
here, by &s;aying that if this place were yours, you thought you &s;hould be
le&s;s able to keep within the bounds of <HI>aeconomy</HI> than
my&s;elf.&mdash;God knows, it is pain and grief to me to ob&s;erve her rules at
<HI>all;</HI> and <HI>rigidly</HI> I never can.&mdash;How is it po&s;&s;ible to
po&s;&s;e&s;s improveable &s;cenes, and not wi&s;h to improve them? and how is
it po&s;&s;ible, with oeconomy, to be at the ex|pence of improving them upon my

attempting <HI>any,</HI> how vexatious! &s;o that I never can enjoy my
&s;ituation&mdash;that is certain.&mdash;Oeconomy, that invidious old matron!
on occa&s;ion of ever frivolous expence, makes &s;uch a helli&s;h &s;qualling,
that the murmur of a ca&s;cade is utterly lo&s;t to me.&mdash;Often do I cry

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY, is lazine&s;s an excu&s;e for not writing? Tell
me.&mdash;However, if it be &s;o, I am afraid I &s;hall want an excu&s;e for
lazine&s;s, like the philo&s;opher, who, &s;uppo&s;ing the world might re&s;t
upon a tortoi&s;e's back, found him&s;elf no le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed for a
pede&s;tal to &s;upport his tortoi&s;e. I have indeed been pretty bu&s;y at
home, in rai&s;ing a pool-dam, and have interchanged a few vi&s;its with &s;uch
of my acquaintance as live within three miles.&mdash;What then?&mdash;I
abominate all excu&s;es that are grounded upon the bu&s;ine&s;s 
<PB N="130" REF="147"> or amu&s;ements of an idle man.&mdash;As if &s;uch a
per&s;on's time was &s;o wholly filled up, that he could not find half an hour
to write a line to his friend. It is be&s;t to acknowledge lazine&s;s at
fir&s;t, and that there are particular intervals, when one is much le&s;s
di&s;po&s;ed to write even a &s;ew lines, than at others. And then, as to
lazine&s;s, one has nothing to do but to plead human frail|ty; which, if a
per&s;on has not too many frailties be&s;ides, may perhaps be indulged him.
How|ever, 
<Q REND="inline">"Veniam petimu&s;que, damu&s;que,"</Q> will not fail
to weigh with every good-natured man. The chief dealing I have with Harris the
Jew is, for the intelligence which he brings me con|cerning you and Mrs.
W&mdash;; but it &s;eldom amounts to much more than that you are well, and in
your garden.</P>
<P>He is an Ebrew Jew, or he would tell me you had purcha&s;ed a couple
of genteel hor&s;es, or a chai&s;e and pair, and were coming over to The
Lea&s;ows to &s;pend a week with me.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I hope to &s;ee you &s;oon; but <HI>en
pa&s;&s;ant</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall go in about a month to Mr. Jago's,
and from thence to Mr. Miller's; who, I believe I told you, was here, with Mr.
Lyttelton, Lady Ayle&s;bury, Colonel Conway, &amp;c. I think I never an&s;wered
your query con|cerning Colonel Lyttelton.&mdash;He is the &s;ame per|&s;on that
you remember, and your prophecy con|cerning him has been literally
accompli&s;hed. He is a man of courage, genius, genero&s;ity, and
po|litene&s;s; has been fortunate in the world; was made a Colonel at about
&s;ix and twenty; di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;everal campaigns; mar|ried
the Dutche&s;s of Bridgewater; and had the other day about &s;ixteen thou&s;and
pounds le&s;t him by Colonel Jefferies, a very di&s;tant relation. He has a
&s;eat, and &s;peaks in the Hou&s;e of Commons, has bought a town and
country-hou&s;e; the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern way. 
<PB N="131" REF="148"> His Dutche&s;s the mo&s;t unceremonious even-tempered
woman that lives.&mdash;So enjoy the &s;pirit of prophecy, and exert it
again.&mdash;It needs little more than good &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Which of the
hi&s;tori|ans is it, that foretold in his hi&s;tory a very re|markable &s;eries
of events, by dint of this alone, and which were all accompli&s;hed? Let me
know what you are doing now. Have you repaired the farm-hou&s;e you talked
of?&mdash;and have you remembered to make the man a couple of good large niches
in his chimney corner, where he, and his family, may &s;pend a more comfortable
evening than was ever &s;pent by any fir&s;t mini&s;ter in
Chri&s;tendom;&mdash;perhaps al&s;o conver&s;e more to the purpo&s;e. You tell
me nothing of your Mr. Jago, Seignior Benedict, the new married man. Tell him
to leave his wife and family for a day or two, &s;addle his mule, and come to
The Lea&s;ows.&mdash;Tell him, all plea&s;ures are heighten|ed by a little
di&s;continuance.&mdash;Tell him, did I &s;ay? how can you for &s;hame advi&s;e
him &s;o con|trarily to your own practice?</P>

bought many kinds of merchandize there. It is a part of philo&s;opy, to adapt
one's pa&s;&s;ions to one's way of life; and the &s;olitary, un&s;ocial

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. &mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the utmo&s;t gratitude for the ob&s;er|vations which you &s;ent
me, and with the highe&s;t opinion of their propriety in gene|ral, do I &s;it
down to an&s;wer your obliging let|ter. You will not take it ami&s;s, I know,
if I &s;crible broken hints, and trace out little &s;ketches of my mind, ju&s;t
as I &s;hould go near to explain it if I were upon the &s;pot, as often as I
think of you, which I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure you happens many times in a day.
They &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline">"A word to the wi&s;e is enough;"</Q> a word,
therefore, to a friend of under&s;tanding may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omething
more than enough, becau&s;e it is pro|bable he is acquainted with three parts
of one's mind before.&mdash;The cen&s;ure you have pa&s;&s;ed upon Milton's
Lycidas, &s;o far as it regards the metre which he has cho&s;en, is
unexceptionably ju&s;t; and one would imagine, if that argument con|cerning the
di&s;tance of the rhimes were pre&s;&s;ed home in a public e&s;&s;ay, it should
be &s;ufficient to extirpate that kind of ver&s;e for ever. As to my opinion
concerning the choice of Engli&s;h metre <PB N="134" REF="151"> I dare not
touch upon the &s;ubject, and I will give you my rea&s;on: I began upon it in a
letter which I intended for you about a month ago; and I &s;oon found that I
had filled a &s;heet of paper with my di&s;&s;ertation, and left no room for
other things which I had more mind to com|municate. Be&s;ide, I &s;ound it &s;o
blotted that I did not chu&s;e to &s;end it; and as the &s;ubject is &s;o
extremely copious, I &s;hall decline it entirely, till <HI>talking</HI> may
prove as effectual as <HI>writing.</HI>&mdash;As to your advice, with regard to
my publications, I believe it to be ju&s;t, and &s;hall, in all probabili|ty,
pur&s;ue it.&mdash;I am afraid, by your account, that Dod&s;ley has publi&s;hed
my name to the School-mi&s;tre&s;s. I was a good deal di&s;plea&s;ed at his
publi&s;hing that poem without my know|ledge, when he had &s;o many
opportunities of giving me &s;ome previous information; but, as he would
probably di&s;regard my re&s;entment, I cho&s;e to &s;tifle it, and wrote to
him directly upon the receipt of yours, that I would be glad to furni&s;h him
with an improved copy of the School mi&s;tre&s;s, &amp;c. for his &s;econd
edition. He accepts it with &s;ome complai&s;ance, de&s;ires it &s;oon; and I
am at a fault to have the opinion of my friends, what alterations or additions
it will be proper to in&s;ert. I have &s;cribled a copy, which I &s;end this
day to Mr. Graves and Mr. Whi&s;tler; but I am greatly fearful I &s;hall not
receive their critici&s;ms time enough, and I &s;hall have the &s;ame longing
for yours. A journey to Whitchurch, which I have long propo&s;ed, might unite
all the&s;e ad|vantages; and I heartily wi&s;h I may be able to effect it
without inconvenience. If I go thither, I call on you.</P>

<P>WHAT a &s;tupid fool was I, to &s;hew you tho&s;e letters of my
friend Graves, where|in he declares him&s;elf &s;o freely again&s;t a regular
corre&s;pondence! &s;ee the effects of it! You have taken immediate advantage
of his example, and I mu&s;t never more expect an an&s;wer to any let|ter that
I &s;end you, in le&s;s than half a century. I wrote to you after I came home,
to thank you for all your kindne&s;s at I&mdash;, &amp;c. but not a &s;yllable
have I been able to receive from you, or a word that I could hear concerning
you. I could, however, very ea&s;ily convince you, that Mr. Graves (your
precedent) is not altogether &s;o hardened an offender as you may imagine. His
la&s;t letter is a very affectionate recantation. I inclo&s;e that part of it
which regards Mr. F&mdash;.</P>
<P>What a number of &s;chemes are irreparably broken by the &s;udden
death of the Prince of Wales! Yours, my good friend, which &s;eems to be
de&s;troyed among&s;t the re&s;t, has, I think, of late given you no
&s;olicitude. Your intere&s;t in Mr. N&mdash; will remain the &s;ame, I
&s;uppo&s;e; and if he would but &s;erve you nearer <HI>home,</HI> I will have
no &s;ort of quarrel with him that he did not tran&s;plant you into
Cornwall.&mdash;It is at lea&s;t &s;ome gratification to a per&s;on's &s;elf
love, when one finds the more <HI>ambitious</HI> hopes of more
<HI>a&s;pir|ing</HI> people as liable to be &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed as one's
own. However, the death of the Prince gave me a good deal of concern, though it
no way affected my <HI>particular</HI> intere&s;t, as he had all the humane,
affable, and generous qualities, which could recommend him to one's
<HI>affection.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Graves has &s;ent me two copies of ver&s;es. One on Medals, to
Mr. Walker; and the other, <PB N="136" REF="153"> on the late Memoirs of the
London Heroines, Lady V&mdash;, Mrs. Pilkington, and Mrs. Phillips. Both good

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I received your letter, I have been a week at W&mdash;. I
believe I may have told you, that I never was fond of that place. There is too
much trivial elegance, too much punctilio for me; and perhaps, as you expre&s;s
it, too much <HI>&s;peculation.</HI> But I was fearful I might entirely lo&s;e
Mr. Whi&s;tler's acquaintance, if I did not make an effort once in five years
to return his vi&s;it. Be&s;ides, I &s;hould have had no hopes of &s;eeing him
at The Lea&s;ows hereafter; and I am extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing both
<HI>him</HI> and <HI>you</HI> here, having made many alterations which I do not
undertake but with an eye to the approbation of my more generous friends; but
he &s;eems, to my great &s;urprize, to renounce the thing called
<HI>ta&s;te</HI> in buildings, gardens, &amp;c. is grown weary of his own
little embelli&s;hments at W&mdash;, and longs to &s;ettle in London for the
greater part of his time. This, I believe, he would put in ex|ecution
immediately; but that he thinks it might give &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s to his
mother, if he &s;hould quit the hou&s;e that &s;he with &s;o much dif|ficulty 
<PB N="138" REF="155"> obtained for him. <HI>I</HI> too am &s;ick of the word
<HI>ta&s;te</HI>; but I think the <HI>thing</HI> it&s;elf the only proper
<HI>ambition,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pecific plea&s;ure</HI> of all who have any
&s;hare in the faculty of imagination. I need not mention my rea&s;ons; you
will &s;oon conceive them. And, however the ca&s;e be, there is one branch of
it which &s;o totally en|gro&s;&s;es the per&s;ons with whom I principally
con|ver&s;e, that I was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear him &s;peak even with
indifference concerning the reigning ta&s;te for rural decorations. I could ill
forbear telling Mr. Whi&s;tler, that he was now <HI>literally</HI> a beau in a
band-box; but the freedom might have given more offence than the joke was
worth. He has improved the place extremely; but I do not like his colonnades.
You know, nothing of that kind is tolerable, unle&s;s regularly ex|ecuted in
&s;tone: that is one thing. Another is, that colonnades are ornaments which
will not <HI>bear</HI> to be very <HI>diminutive.</HI> Mr. &mdash; (who&s;e
hou&s;e only I &s;aw) has been at the expence of a large cornice round it, in
mo&s;t elaborate brick-work; but with regard to his &s;tucco-work
<HI>within</HI> doors, he is quite <HI>extravagant.</HI>&mdash;I mention
the&s;e things upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that you may like to hear <HI>any</HI>
thing that regards the place; but indeed they are &s;o mighty trifling, that I
ought to doubt my &s;uppo&s;ition. I &s;upped with Mr. P&mdash;'s family once
at Mr. W&mdash;'s, and all was mighty well; only I happen to have a violent
aver&s;ion to card-playing, and at W&mdash; I think they do nothing
<HI>el&s;e.</HI> So that, on account of my ignorance at qua|drille, or any
creditable game, I was forced to lo&s;e my money, and two evenings out of my
&s;even, at Pope Joan with Mr. P&mdash;'s children. Mr. W&mdash;, to make me
amends, invited me to breakfa&s;t, and &s;hewed me your ver&s;es. I a&s;&s;ure
you, you have no occa&s;ion for a better advocate than Mr. W&mdash;; whether
with regard to his <HI>judgement,</HI> or his zeal in behalf of the &s;ubject, 
<PB N="139" REF="156"> the ver&s;es or the poet. I would fain have obtained a
copy; but he did not care to give one without your commi&s;&s;ion. I hope
<HI>you</HI> will oblige me &s;o far. I like them very much; the &s;ubject is
genteel, and the ver&s;es ea&s;y and elegant. We agreed upon one or two
dif|ferent readings; and one &s;tanza that concerns cards &s;hould, I think, be
corrected. Not that I would have you le&s;s &s;evere upon cards nei|ther; I was
even glad to find, that you g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ve
them &s;o little quarter. I &s;ometimes thought that Mr. W&mdash;'s &s;eeming
fondne&s;s for them was a kind of <HI>contre-caeur.</HI>&mdash;Be that as it
will, his ob|jection to the &s;tanza, as well as mine, was &s;olely founded on
the ver&s;ification, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the
&s;entiment. I liked his Latin ver&s;es; but they do not inter|fere with
your's. Send me a copy, and confine my u&s;e of it by what limitations you
plea&s;e. My reigning toy at pre&s;ent is a pocket-book; and I glory as much in
furni&s;hing it with the ver&s;es of my acquaintance, as others would with
bank-bills. I did not know when I went to W&mdash;, but I might have heard Mrs.
G&mdash; <HI>accu&s;ed of certain que&s;tions touching their law</HI> (I mean
of forms and ceremonies); but I did <HI>not.</HI> On the contrary, I had the
&s;atisfaction of hearing her per&s;on, her temper, and her under&s;tanding,
much commended; but this I did not want. The delicacy of your ta&s;te, is equal
with me to a thou&s;and commendations. Mrs. W&mdash; is really &s;o much
altered by her indi&s;po&s;ition, that I did not know her. She talks of going
to Bath this &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;I talked of it too, and wi&s;h it of all earthly
things. You mu&s;t know, I could not have come to Claverton <HI>in&s;tead</HI>
of going to W&mdash;, as I did not determine on the expedition at home; but at
a friend's hou&s;e, where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my way
thither. Be&s;ides, I would allow my&s;elf more time when I turn my face
towards Bath, than I could this <PB N="140" REF="157"> winter. Your invitation,
as it is very obliging, &s;o it has many concurring circum&s;tances to
re|commend it at this time. I want to recover my health, which mu&s;t be
recovered by Bath, or <HI>nothing</HI> I want to have you read &s;ome trifles
of mine, which mu&s;t be ratified by you, or <HI>no one</HI>; but principally,
and above all, do I long to &s;ee you, my old friend, and Mrs. G&mdash;, whom I
expect you &s;hould render my new one.&mdash;I am obliged for your charitable

but &s;carce any thing le&s;s, in <HI>winter.</HI> Solitary life, limited
circum&s;tances, a phlegma|tic habit, and di&s;agreeable events, have given me
a melancholy turn, that is hardly di&s;&s;ipated by the mo&s;t &s;erene &s;ky;
but in a north-ea&s;t wind, is quite intolerable. After a long &s;tate of this
kind, upon every acce&s;s of amu&s;ement, one is apt to think it is not
<HI>right</HI> to be happy; that it is one of Wolla&s;ton's implicit lies; a
treating things contrary to what they <HI>de&s;erve.</HI>&mdash;Your
&s;itu|ation at Claverton is admired by mo&s;t people; and, if you could
connect &s;ome little matter in the neighbourhood, would be as &s;urely

<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ibly obliged to you for the <HI>diligence</HI> and

in me by our long &s;eparation; nor will it at any time be po&s;&s;ible I

have no &s;ort of exceptions to make again&s;t the province in which you were

merit, genius and learning; and then you had all tho&s;e advantages <HI>par

you have &s;omething of the &s;ame &s;ort of rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with
them, that I have to be plea&s;ed with tho&s;e that are given to my place;
which I con&s;ider as naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many beauties, each of
them brought to light, and perfected through my own di&s;cernment, care and
cultiva|tion. And then, your plea&s;ure ought to be &s;o much greater than
mine, as you have a nobler &s;ubject to enjoy.&mdash;Mrs. G&mdash; has too much
&s;en&s;e to object again&s;t the freedom of this &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>I cannot help adding a few &s;trokes to your picture of Mrs.

have re|commended my&s;elf to a greater degree of her favour; but her vanity
and affectations are be|yond what I could bear. Your account of &mdash; is very
picture&s;que, and agreeable to the idea I always had of him; but I believe
that idea was perfected by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
ob&s;ervations I made when I had &s;ome of his company at London. There was
&s;omething accountable enough to me in their burle&s;quing Mr. L&mdash;'s
monody. He is, you know, engaged in a party, and his poem (though an
extraordinary fine compo&s;ition) was too tender for the public ear. It
&s;hould have been printed privately, and a number of copies di&s;per&s;ed only
among their friends and acquain|tances;&mdash;but even &s;o, it would have been
re|publi&s;hed; <PB N="143" REF="160"> and it was too good to &s;uppre&s;s. I

&s;ome relation of theirs, or only their at|torney? The affair is uncommonly
&s;hocking; and I fancy the <HI>genuine</HI> accounts that Mr. W&mdash; &s;ends

drew out a fe&s;toon and a medal &s;ome time ago, for a pan|nel over Mr.

the fe&s;toon executed in &s;tone colour, by a com|mon painter;&mdash;yours is
better, and in character.&mdash;I am a degree more frugal than you; for I only

Brother.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Feb. 14, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be amazed at my long &s;ilence; and it might rea&s;onably
excite &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t if my days had pa&s;&s;ed of late in the manner they
u&s;ed to do: but I am not the man I was; per|haps I never <HI>&s;hall</HI> be.
Alas! my deare&s;t friend! I have lo&s;t my only brother! and, &s;ince the
fatal clo&s;e of November, I have had neither peace nor re&s;pite from
agonizing thoughts!</P>
<P>You, I think, have <HI>&s;een</HI> my brother; but per|haps had no
opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing him from the groupe of others, whom we call
<HI>good-natured</HI> men. This part of his character was &s;o vi&s;ible in his
countenance, that he was generally beloved at &s;ight; <HI>I,</HI> who mu&s;t
be allowed to know him, do a&s;&s;ure you, that his under&s;tanding was no way
inferior to his benevolence. He had not only a &s;ound judgement, but a lively
wit and genuine humour. As the&s;e were many times eclip&s;ed by his native
ba&s;hfulne&s;s, &s;o his benevolence only &s;uffered by being &s;hewn to an
exce&s;s. I here mean his giving too indi&s;crimi|nately into tho&s;e jovial
meetings of company, where the warmth of a &s;ocial temper is di&s;cover|ed
with le&s;s re&s;erve; but the virtues of his head and heart would &s;oon have
&s;hone without alloy. The foibles of his youth were wearing off; and his
affection for me and regard to my advice, with his own good &s;en&s;e, would
&s;oon have rendered him all that I could have wi&s;hed in a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. I
never in my life knew a per&s;on more &s;incere in the expre&s;&s;ion of love
or di&s;like. <PB N="146" REF="163"> But it was the <HI>former</HI> that
&s;uited the propen&s;ity of his heart; the <HI>latter</HI> was as tran&s;ient
as the &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion that occa&s;ioned it. In &s;hort, with much true
genius and real fortitude, he was, ac|cording to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
acceptation, 
<Q REND="inline">"a true hone&s;t man;"</Q> and I think I may al&s;o
add, a truly Engli&s;h character; but 
<Q REND="inline">"habeo, dixi? immo <HI>habui</HI> fratrem &amp;
amicum, Chreme!"</Q> All this have I <HI>lo&s;t</HI> in him. He is now in
re|gard to <HI>this</HI> world no more than a mere idea. And this idea,
therefore, though deeply tinged with melancholy, I mu&s;t, and &s;urely
<HI>ought</HI> to, cheri&s;h and pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>I believe I wrote you &s;ome account of his ill|ne&s;s la&s;t
&s;pring; from which, to all appearance, he was tolerably well recovered. He
took the air, and vi&s;ited about with me, during the war|mer months of
&s;ummer; but my plea&s;ure was of &s;hort duration. 
<Q REND="inline">"Hae&s;it lateri lethalis arundo!"</Q> The
peripneumony under which he laboured in the &s;pring had terminated in an
adhe&s;ion of the lungs to the pleura, &s;o that he could never lie but on his
right &s;ide; and this, as the weather grew colder, occa&s;ioned an
ob&s;truction that could never be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>Though my rea&s;on forewarned me of the event, I was not the more
prepared for it.&mdash;Let me not dwell upon it&mdash;.It is altogether
in&s;uppor|table in <HI>every re&s;pect</HI>: and my imagination &s;eems more
a&s;&s;iduous in educing pain from this occa|&s;ion, than I ever yet found it
in admini&s;tering to my plea&s;ure.&mdash;This hurts me to no
purpo&s;e.&mdash;I know it; and yet, when I have avocated my thoughts, and
fixed them for a while upon com|mon amu&s;ements, I &s;uffer the &s;ame &s;ort
of con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s as if I were guilty of a crime. Believe me, this has
been the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible affliction I ever felt in my life; and you, who
know my anxiety when I had far le&s;s rea&s;on to complain, will more ea&s;ily
<HI>conceive</HI> it now, than I am able to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="164">I cannot pretend to fill up my paper with my
u&s;ual &s;ubjects.&mdash;I &s;hould thank you for your re|marks upon my
poetry; but I de&s;pi&s;e poetry: and I might tell you of all my little rural
im|provements; but I hate them.&mdash;What can I now expect from my &s;olitary
rambles through them, but a &s;eries of melancholy reflections and irk|&s;ome
anticipations?&mdash;Even the plea&s;ure I &s;hould take in in &s;hewing them
to <HI>you,</HI> the greate&s;t they can afford me, mu&s;t be now greatly
inferior to what it might formerly have been.</P>
<P>How have I pro&s;tituted my &s;orrow on occa|&s;ions that little
concerned me! I am a&s;hamed to think of that idle 
<Q REND="inline">"Elegy upon Autumn."</Q> when I have &s;o much more
important cau&s;e to hate and to condemn it <HI>now</HI>; but the glare and
gaiety of the Spring is what I <HI>principally</HI> dread; when I &s;hall find
all things re&s;tored but my poor bro|ther, and &s;omething like tho&s;e lines
of Milton will run for ever in my thoughts:

de&s;poiled of all I have chiefly valu|ed for thirty years together; of all my
pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and all my future pro&s;pects. The melody of birds,
which he no more mu&s;t hear; the chearful beams of the &s;un, of which he no
more mu&s;t partake; <HI>every</HI> wonted plea&s;ure will produce that
<HI>&s;ort</HI> of pain to which my temper is mo&s;t obnoxious. Do not
con&s;ider this as poetry.&mdash;Poetry on &s;uch occa&s;ions is no more than
literal truth. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it is <HI>le&s;s</HI>; for half the
tenderne&s;s I feel is altogether &s;hapele&s;s and inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>

which I never can enjoy!</P>

<P>About the middle of November I had pre|pared a letter for you, which
lies now among&s;t my papers. At that time, amid&s;t all my appre|hen&s;ions, I
had &s;ome hopes to &s;upport me; but before I could &s;end it, my &s;ituation

effectually rendered me the mo&s;t wretched of mankind.</P>
<P>Thus much it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould tell you; you will pardon
me, if I do not de&s;cend any farther into an account of merit that is lo&s;t,
and of &s;orrow which is too apt to revive of it&s;elf. Be a&s;&s;ured, it is
to me a lo&s;s which the whole <PB N="149" REF="166"> world cannot
compen&s;ate; and an affliction which the longe&s;t time I can live will not be

<P>You, Sir, I pre&s;ume, proceed in the innocent recreations of your
garden, and tho&s;e may at lea&s;t prove a balance for any &s;mall di&s;quiets
that attend you. If greater ills befal you, you have per&s;ons near you to

<DATE>Oct. 3, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. G&mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very unfeignedly a&s;hamed to reflect how long it is &s;ince I
received your pre&s;ent, and how much longer it is &s;ince I received your
letter. I have been re&s;olving to write to you almo&s;t daily ever &s;ince you
left me; yet have fooli&s;hly enough permitted avocations (of infi|nitely
le&s;s importance than your corre&s;pon|dence) to interfere with my gratitude,
my in|tere&s;t, and my inclination. What apology I have to make, though no way
adequate to my negligence, is in &s;hort as follows. After the receipt of your
letter, I deferred writing till I could &s;peak of the arrival of your
picture.&mdash;This did not happen till about a month or five weeks ago, when I
was embarra&s;&s;ed with ma&s;ons, carvers, carpenters, and company, all at a
time. And though it were idle enough to &s;ay, that I <PB N="152" REF="169">
could not find <HI>one</HI> vacant hour for my purpo&s;e, yet in truth my head
was &s;o confu&s;ed by the&s;e multifarious di&s;tractions, that I could have
writ|ten nothing &s;atisfactory either to <HI>my&s;elf</HI> or <HI>you:</HI>
nothing worth a &s;ingle <HI>penny,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the po&s;tage were to
co&s;t you no more. The work|men had not <HI>fini&s;hed my rooms</HI> a minute,
when Lady Luxborough, Mrs. Davies, and Mr. Out|ing arrived, with <HI>five</HI>
&s;ervants and a <HI>&s;et</HI> of hor&s;es, to &s;tay with me for &s;ome time.
After a nine days' vi&s;it, I returned with them to Barrels, where I continued
for a week; and whither (by the way) I go again with Lord Dudley in about a
fortnight's time. Other company filled up the inter&s;tices of my &s;ummer; and
I hope my dear friend will accept of this apology for &s;o long a cha&s;m of
&s;ilence, during which I have been uniformly at his &s;ervice, and true to
that inviolable friend&s;hip I &s;hall ever bear him.</P>
<P>I proceed now to thank you for the <HI>di&s;tinction,</HI> you
&s;hew me, in &s;ending me your picture: I do it very &s;incerely, It is
a&s;&s;uredly a &s;trong like|ne&s;s, as my Lady Luxborough with all her
&s;er|vants that have <HI>&s;een you</HI> pronounce, as well as I;
con&s;equently more valuable to a <HI>friend</HI> than a face he does not know,
though it were one of Raphael's: The &s;mile about the mouth is bad, as it
agrees but ill with the gravity of the eyes; and as a &s;mile, ever &s;o little
<HI>outre</HI> has a bad effect in a picture where it is <HI>con&s;tant,</HI>
though it may be ever &s;o graceful in a per&s;on where it is
<HI>tran&s;itory.</HI> However, this may be altered, when I can meet with a
good painter. I have no <HI>other</HI> objection, but to the prominence of the
belly. The hair, I think, is good; and the coat and band no way exceptionable.
I have given it all the advantage I can: it has a good light, and makes part of
an elegant chimney-piece in a genteel, though little breakfa&s;t-room, at the
end of my hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="170">Mr. Whi&s;tler and I are now upon good terms,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COULD I with convenience mount my hor&s;e, and ride to Harbury this
in&s;tant, I &s;hould much more willingly do &s;o than begin this letter. Such
terrible events have happened to us, &s;ince we &s;aw each other la&s;t, that,
how|ever irk&s;ome it may be to dwell upon them, it is, in the &s;ame degree,
unnatural to &s;ub&s;titute any &s;ubject in their place.</P>
<P>I do &s;incerely forgive your long &s;ilence, my good friend, indeed
I do; though it gave me unea&s;ine&s;s. I hope you do the &s;ame by mine. I
own, I could not readily account for the <HI>former</HI> period of yours, any
otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;ing that I had &s;aid or done &s;omething, in the
levity of my heart, which had given you di&s;gu&s;t; but being con&s;cious to
my&s;elf of the mo&s;t &s;incere regard for you, and believing it could never
be di&s;credited for any <HI>trivial</HI> inad|vertencies, I remember, I
continued &s;till in ex|pectation of a letter, and did not dream of writing
till &s;uch time as I had received one. I tru&s;ted you would write at
<HI>la&s;t</HI>; and that, by all my pa&s;t endeavours to demon&s;trate my 
<PB N="155" REF="172"> <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> you would believe the
<HI>tree</HI> was rooted in my heart, whatever irregularity you might ob&s;erve
in the <HI>branches.</HI></P>
<P>This was my &s;ituation before that dreadful aera which gave me
&s;uch a &s;hock as to bani&s;h my be&s;t friends for a time out of my
memory.&mdash;And when they recurred, as they did the fir&s;t of any thing, I
was made acquainted with that deplorable mi&s;fortune of yours! Believe me, I
&s;ympathized in <HI>your</HI> affliction, notwith&s;tanding my own; but, alas!
what comfort could I ad|mini&s;ter, who had need of every po&s;&s;ible
a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to &s;upport my&s;elf? I wrote indeed a few letters with
<HI>difficulty</HI>; among&s;t the re&s;t, one to my friend Graves; but it was
to vent my com|plaint.&mdash;I will &s;end you the letter, if you plea&s;e, as
it is by far my lea&s;t painful method of con|veying you &s;ome account of my
&s;ituation. Let it convince you, that I could have written nothing at that
time, which could have been of any &s;er|vice to you: let it afford you, at
lea&s;t, a faint &s;ketch of my deare&s;t brother's character; but let it not
appear an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of &s;orrow, of which I am by no means
guilty. I know but too well that I di&s;covered upon the occa&s;ion, what
&s;ome would call, an unmanly tenderne&s;s; but I know al&s;o, that &s;orrow
upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e is very con&s;i&s;tent with virtue, and with
the mo&s;t ab&s;olute re&s;ignation to the ju&s;t decrees of Providence. 
<Q REND="inline">"Hominis e&s;t enim affici dolore,

never &s;uffered my&s;elf to be a minute without company, no matter what, &s;o
it was but continual. At length, by an attention to &s;uch conver&s;ation and
&s;uch amu&s;ements as I could at other times de&s;pi&s;e, I forgot &s;o far as
to be chearful.&mdash;And after this, the &s;ummer, through an almo&s;t
con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lively and agree|able vi&s;itants, proved even a
&s;cene of jollity.&mdash;It <PB N="156" REF="173"> was inebriation all, though
of a mingled nature; yet has it maintained a &s;ort of truce with grief, till
time can a&s;&s;i&s;t me more effectually by throwing back the event to a
di&s;tance.&mdash;Now, indeed, that my company have all for&s;aken me, and I am
delivered up to winter, &s;ilence, and reflection, the incidents of the la&s;t
year revive apace in my memory; and I am even a&s;toni&s;hed to think of the
gaiety of my &s;ummer. The fatal anniver&s;a|ry, the 
<Q REND="inline">"dies quem &s;emper acerbum, &amp;c."</Q> is
beginning to approach, and every face of the &s;ky &s;ugge&s;ts the ideas of
la&s;t winter.&mdash;Yet I find my&s;elf chearful in <HI>company</HI>; nor
would I recom|mend it to you to be much alone.&mdash;You would lay the
highe&s;t obligation upon me by coming over at this time.&mdash;I pre&s;&s;ed
your brother, whom I &s;aw at Birmingham, to u&s;e his influence with you; but
if you can by no means undertake the journey, I will take my &s;peedie&s;t
opportunity of &s;eeing you at Harbury.&mdash;Mr. Miller invited me
&s;trenuou&s;ly to meet Dr. Lyttelton at his hou&s;e; but I believe my mo&s;t
convenient &s;ea&s;on will be, when my Lord Dudley goes to Barrels; for I can
but ill bear the pen&s;ivene&s;s of a long and lonely expedition. After all, if
you <HI>could</HI> come hither fir&s;t, it would afford me the mo&s;t entire
&s;atisfaction.&mdash;I have been making alterations in my hou&s;e that would
amu&s;e you, and have many matters to di&s;cour&s;e with you, which it would be
endle&s;s to mention upon paper.&mdash;Adieu, my dear friend! may your merit be
known to &s;ome one who has greater <HI>power</HI> to &s;erve you than
my&s;elf; but be a&s;&s;ured, at the &s;ame time, that no one loves you better,

<P>ALTHOUGH I have many rea&s;ons to urge why I did not write to you
before, or vi&s;it you from Barrels as I fully intended, I will venture to wave
all particulars till I &s;ee you; and only a&s;&s;ure you in the general, that
I was never able to write any thing &s;atisfactory, or to vi&s;it you, at that
time, with any &s;ort of con|venience.</P>
<P>Believe me, my good friend, if <HI>inclination</HI> might have
ruled, I had been with you at Har|bury many weeks ago. Sure I am, they mu&s;t

<P>I cannot even now fix a time when I can &s;ee you; and perhaps it
may be deferred till Mr. Miller's place will have received &s;ome advan|tage
from the Spring; and, in that ca&s;e, I would infallibly &s;ee my Lord

wan|der from home with any kind of &s;atisfaction, you will do me the ju&s;tice
to believe, that you have no friend alive who will more gladly re|ceive you
than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have papered &s;ome rooms this la&s;t year, and would willingly
have you &s;ee them before their colours are vani&s;hed; which, I think, will
un|avoidably be the ca&s;e of <HI>one,</HI> before a &s;econd &s;ummer be half

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you &s;ome account of my&s;elf, and inclo&s;ed &s;ome
trivial critici&s;ms, in a letter I &s;ent you about a fortnight ago, which I
hope you have received.&mdash;Tom comes now to enquire after your health, and
to bring back my ode to Colonel Lyttelton; in regard to which, I de&s;ire, that
you will not be &s;paring of your animadver|&s;ions. I whi&s;pered my
difficulties to Mr. Miller at Hagley, how delicate I found the &s;ubject, and
how hard it was to &s;atisfy either my&s;elf or others; in all which points he
agreed with me. Neverthele&s;s, having twice broke my <HI>promi&s;e</HI> of
&s;ending a corrected copy to Sir George, I was obliged to make my peace by a
<HI>fre&s;h</HI> one, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, I mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity,
perform.&mdash;Give me your whole &s;entiments hereupon, I be&s;eech you; in
particular and in general, as a critic and as a friend.&mdash;The bad &s;tate
of &s;pirits which I complained of in my la&s;t, for a long time to|gether made
me utterly irre&s;olute: every thing occa&s;ioned me &s;u&s;pence; and I did
nothing with appetite.&mdash;This was owing in a great mea&s;ure to a &s;low
nervous fever, as I have &s;ince di&s;covered by many concurrent &s;ymptoms. It
is now, I think, wearing off by degrees. I &s;eem to anti|cipate 
<PB N="160" REF="177"> a little of that 
<Q REND="inline">"vernal delight"</Q> which Milton mentions, and
thinks 
<Q> 
<L>Able to cha&s;e</L> 
<L>All &s;adne&s;s, but de&s;pair.</L></Q> At lea&s;t, I begin to
re&s;ume my &s;illy clue of hopes and expectations; which, I know, however,
<HI>will</HI> not guide me to any thing more &s;atisfactory than before.</P>
<P>I have read &s;carce any new books this &s;ea&s;on. Voltaire's new
Tragedy was &s;ent me from Lon|don; but what has given me the mo&s;t
amu&s;e|ment, <HI>has</HI> been the 
<Q REND="inline">"Lettres de Madame de Maintenon."</Q> You have
probably read them already in Engli&s;h, and then I need not recom|mend them.
The Life of Lord Bolingbroke is entirely his <HI>public</HI> life, and the book
three parts filled with political remarks.</P>
<P>As to <HI>writing,</HI> I have not attempted it this year and more;
nor do I know when I &s;hall again.&mdash;However, I would be glad to correct
that Ode 
<Q REND="inline">"To the Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et,"</Q> when once I
can find in who&s;e hands it is depo|&s;ited. I was <HI>&s;hewn</HI> a very
elegant letter of hers, the other day; wherein &s;he a&s;ks for it with great
politene&s;s. And as it includes nothing but a love of rural life, and &s;uch
&s;ort of amu&s;e|ments as &s;he her&s;elf approves, I &s;hall &s;tand a good
chance of having it received with partia|lity. She lives the life of a
<HI>religieu&s;e.</HI> She has <HI>written</HI> my Lady Luxborough a very
&s;erious let|ter of condolance upon the misfortune in her family; and need
enough has Lady Luxborough of &s;o unchangeable a friend! for &s;ure nothing
could have happened to a per&s;on in her &s;ituation more
<HI>&s;pecifically</HI> unfortunate.&mdash;Mr. Reynolds has been at Barrels, I
hear, and has brought her a machine that goes into a coat-pocket, yet
an|&s;wers the end of 
<Q REND="inline">"a jack for boots, a reading-de&s;k, 
<PB N="161" REF="178"> a cribbage-board, a pair of &s;nuffers, a ruler, an
eighteen inch-rule, three pair of nut-cracks, a lemon-&s;queezer, two
candle&s;ticks, a picquet board, and the Lord knows what
be|&s;ide."&mdash;</Q>Can you form an idea of it? if you can, do you not think
it mu&s;t give me pain to reflect, that I my&s;elf am u&s;eful for <HI>no</HI>
&s;ort of pur|po&s;e, when a paltry bit of wood can an&s;wer &s;o
<HI>many?</HI> but, indeed, whil&s;t it <HI>pretends</HI> to the&s;e exploits,
it performs nothing <HI>well</HI>; and therein I agree with it. So true it is,
with regard to me, what I told you long ago, 
<Q> 
<L>Multa &amp; praeclara minantem</L> 
<L>Vivere nec recte, nec &s;uaviter!</L></Q></P>
<P>We have a turnpike bill upon the point of be|ing brought into the
Hou&s;e of Commons; it will convey you about half the way betwixt Birmingham
and Hales, and from thence to Hagley; but, I tru&s;t, there will be a <HI>left
hand</HI> attraction, which will always make you deviate from the &s;trait
line.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to reflect how much I have dwelt upon
<HI>my&s;elf</HI> in this letter; but that I &s;eriou&s;ly approve of egoti&s;m
in letters; and were I <HI>not</HI> to do &s;o, I &s;hould not have any other
&s;ubject. I have not a &s;ingle neighbour, that is either fraught with
politene&s;s, literature, or in|telligence; much le&s;s have I a tide of
&s;pirits to &s;et my invention afloat; but the le&s;s I am able to amu&s;e
<HI>you,</HI> the more de&s;irous am I of your let|ters; which afford me the

<P>I AM vexed to find you have no copy of tho&s;e ver&s;es.&mdash;I

all you can in the way of <HI>hints</HI> and <HI>corrections.</HI> Corrections
of what <HI>is,</HI> and hints of what <HI>may be.</HI> I do not reckon much
upon the&s;e ver&s;es, or the patronage which you mention; though the
Dutche&s;s is a woman of high reputation, and has as much benevolence as any
woman upon earth.</P>
<P>I do <HI>not</HI> include the de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Bath as a
public place: I have long &s;ince given up &s;uch &s;chemes of gaiety and
expence. I vi&s;it <HI>you</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Graves;</HI> at the lea&s;t, I
mean to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Inoculatioin is a point on which I never &s;peak a &s;yllable in the
way of <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con:</HI> I mean, not &s;o as to influence
particulars; for, in the gene|ral, I e&s;teem it both right and &s;alutary, and
even <HI>right</HI> becau&s;e we <HI>find</HI> it <HI>&s;alutary.</HI></P>
<P>I do not know whether I could not bear the <HI>di&s;honour</HI> of
friends or relations better than their <HI>death.</HI>&mdash;It mu&s;t afford
one no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to give them one's affection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
under every frailty to which human nature is expo&s;ed; at lea&s;t, &s;o long
as they are true to friend&s;hip. It is Mr. Whi&s;tler's opinion, as well as
mine. But Mr. &mdash;'s ca&s;e is altogether different; and I make no
que&s;tion that he thinks as you do up|on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Poor Danvers's death affects me more than you would perhaps imagine.
If you remember, I was at M&mdash; when the &s;cheme of his going abroad was in
agitation.&mdash;I think how this event mu&s;t affect Mrs. T&mdash;, who&s;e
concern will not <PB N="163" REF="182"> be <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> by her long
&s;eparation from him. I dare &s;ay he reckoned upon his relations here as his
<HI>be&s;t e&s;tate,</HI> whatever he might gain el&s;ewhere; and, no doubt,
the hope of retiring among&s;t them has been a con&s;tant &s;pur to his
diligence.&mdash;The event was always uncertain, and has proved at la&s;t
unfortunate; yet, as Melmoth &s;ays very ju&s;tly, 
<Q REND="inline">"The cour&s;e of human affairs requires that we
&s;hould act with vigour upon very pre|carious contingencies."&mdash;</Q>I
de&s;ire you would give me a &s;ight of the Latin in&s;cription.</P>
<P>I think it was the Gentleman's Magazine in which I was &s;hewn your
ver&s;es.</P>
<P>I have a particular and lively idea of your place; though I do not
remember to have &s;een even &s;uch <HI>parts</HI> of a &s;cene as I have
united to|gether in my imagination. I cannot think other|wi&s;e than that the

&amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<Q>Hac ibat Simois, haec e&s;t Sigeia tellus.</Q>
<P>The &s;ight of the place could not impre&s;s my imagination more
deeply; though the impre&s;&s;ion I <HI>am to</HI> acquire will hardly leave
one line of my pre&s;ent one remaining. <HI>Cabbage-garden orn&eacute;e</HI> is
very high burle&s;que, and affects the improve|ments of your friend too
nearly.</P>
<P>Let me know in what manner Mrs. Graves and you are drawn. Be as
particular as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I could not be clear from your letter whether you had received the
box or not. That, toge|ther with the tallies, lay on the table before me, while
I wrote to you la&s;t; and went with my letter to Birmingham.&mdash;Pray
&s;atisfy me directly whether you received them.&mdash;They are trifles,
indeed; but, as they acquit me of my promi&s;e, they are virtually of
con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="183">Mr. Whi&s;tler has not an&s;wered a letter

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>July 25, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND you my Ode, as I &s;ent it to the Dutche&s;s &s;ome weeks
ago. Why I pitched upon one reading &s;ooner than another, I will not now
explain: nor will I trouble you to make any fre&s;h remarks upon it at
pre&s;ent; only, when you happen to read it over at your lei&s;ure, if any
thing occurs to you that would tend to perfect it, I would beg you
occa&s;ionally to make &s;ome memorandums. I have not yet received an an&s;wer;
but, as I accompanied the ver&s;es with a letter, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall
receive one in re|turn. I al&s;o added, to fill a blank &s;pace in my
paper-book, a poem which I call 
<Q REND="inline">"The Vi&s;ta;"</Q> and which you may perhaps
recollect: how pro|perly I know not, for I had the benefit of no per&s;on's
<HI>judgement</HI> or advice.</P>
<P>Lord Dudley made Mr. Dolman a pre&s;ent of a piece of plate, a large
cup, in con&s;ideration of his &s;i&s;ter's being at Broom about half a year.
There was on it, one &s;upporter awkwardly enough holding up the coronet in his
paw; and from the coronet proceeded a label, with 
<Q REND="inline">"amo|ris ergo Dudley."</Q> I do not know who was the
manager, or whence he had the in&s;cription; but I think, from Dr. H&mdash;.
This is <HI>elegant</HI> and <HI>enough.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, as there may be
&s;ome con|venience in dazzling the eyes of the people where I dwell, and as
<HI>&s;uch</HI> eyes as theirs are not to be dazzled, and hardly
<HI>&s;truck,</HI> by <HI>elegance</HI> alone, I cho&s;e the method that was
mo&s;t <HI>magni|ficent.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h they are not invidious enough to
&s;ay, that <HI>his</HI> arms are engraved there for want of &s;ome of my
<HI>own:</HI> &s;o I would not be long be|fore their notable
&s;ugge&s;tion.&mdash;I have truly &s;o <PB N="166" REF="185"> low an opinion
of arms &s;ince they became pur|cha&s;eable by money, and &s;ince the pre&s;ent
un|limited u&s;e of them, that were I to find a coat to my name in the office,
which I did not like, I would not u&s;e it; but &s;ub&s;titute what was more
agreeable: yet &s;ome <HI>&s;ort</HI> of <HI>right</HI> or <HI>claim</HI> is
re|qui&s;ite to &s;atisfy one's delicacy, with an opinion of <HI>property</HI>;
and indeed, to fix one's <HI>choice,</HI> where one has the whole furniture of
the univer&s;e for <HI>its</HI> object.&mdash;After all, the vulgar are more
&s;truck with arms than any thing; 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;tupet in titulis &amp; imaginibus;"</Q> and, I
believe, there were near two hundred people gathered round Lady Lux|borough's
landau at Birmingham, and declaring her arms to be very <HI>noble,</HI> or
otherwi&s;e.&mdash;I do not, therefore, chu&s;e to employ a vulgar
<HI>mind</HI> about this matter.&mdash;Were you to go London, I &s;hould gladly
&s;olicit <HI>you</HI>; or if you have any friend you could write to in town,
to &s;earch the office; for really I have none that I like <HI>for the
purpo&s;e.</HI> It will not co&s;t above a couple of &s;hil|lings.&mdash;I will
&s;end you a draught of the lid of my &s;tandi&s;h when it arrives:&mdash;for I
really do not know what Mr. Hylton will put upon it: I find, he con&s;ults with
Dr. B&mdash;, my Lord's phy&s;ician.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>De</HI> Dudley"</Q> would run mo&s;t
abominably, and 
<Q REND="inline">"Baro Dudley"</Q> may be authorized by the fre|quent
practice of Maittaire.&mdash;If it be in&s;cribed 
<Q REND="inline">"Dudley"</Q> <HI>alone,</HI> I can add the re&s;t if
I &s;hould hereafter think proper; and I wi&s;h it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>My ver&s;es to the Colonel are not yet tran&s;crib|ed.</P>
<P>I think the Latin in&s;cription to your brother very elegant; and I
&s;hould not care to have any part of it omitted.&mdash;I would, by all means,
have this little hi&s;tory of his life perpetuated. 
<Q REND="inline">"His &s;altem, &amp;c."</Q> And were you to put it
into Engli&s;h, it would be too long for an in&s;cription;&mdash;unle&s;s you
were, by means of a printed elegy with notes, or any other &s;uch method, to
pro|duce <PB N="167" REF="186"> the &s;ame effect; and then you might make the
epitaph as &s;hort as you plea&s;ed.&mdash;After all the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
method is perhaps as eligible. When the affair is nearer a conclu&s;ion, I
&s;hould be glad to be of any &s;ervice.&mdash;I will think, and write again
about it,</P>
<P>And now, having &s;poke to &s;uch matters as have been the &s;ubject
of our late corre&s;pondence, I am at liberty to diver&s;ify my letter as I
may.&mdash;I &s;hould be glad to know in your next whether you have heard of
late from Mr. Whi&s;tler; and whether he is confined at home as u&s;ual by his
mother's &s;tate of health. I almo&s;t de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing him again at

was in Shrop&s;hire: add to this, the &s;everal <HI>acquaintances</HI> I have

with freedom.&mdash;I do not know whether you &s;aw Mr. Davenport and his

appointment to go over the week after next. He has al&s;o a painter at this

our country; yet I never leave home but with reluctance.&mdash;I real|ly

<HEAD>LXXV. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Jan. 29, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a lo&s;s how to begin this letter.&mdash;I will not,
however, after the u&s;ual way, give you a tedious li&s;t of <HI>apologies</HI>
in the front of it. Some account of my long &s;ilence you will find
di&s;per&s;ed throughout the letter; and as for what is deficient, I will
depend upon your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>There has not been a per&s;on here &s;ince you left me, of whom I
could obtain the lea&s;t in|telligence concerning you. And as an enquiry by the
po&s;t was my only obvious method, I do acknowledge my&s;elf to blame,
notwith&s;tanding all the excu&s;es that I can make.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the conflux of vi&s;itants whom I re|ceived this
&s;ea&s;on, I was hardly once <HI>&s;o</HI> happy as I was in <HI>your</HI>
company. I was the happier in &s;eeing <HI>you</HI> &s;o; and, if you remember,
I took notice at the time, how little your vivacity was impaired in
compari&s;on of my own. If I was <HI>then</HI> but a dull <HI>companion,</HI>
gue&s;s whether &s;olitude and winter were likely to make me a better
<HI>cor|re&s;pondent.</HI> That vein of gaiety and humour, which you were once
&s;o partial as to di&s;cover in my letters, will &s;carce appear there any
more: not even to the eyes of the mo&s;t partial friend I have. Should you deny
what I a&s;&s;ert, and im|pute it to a fit of &s;pleen, yet you may
<HI>allow</HI> that it will &s;carce enliven any letter that I write in
<HI>winter.</HI> Friend&s;hip &s;till remains! Friend&s;hip, like the root of
&s;ome perennial flower, even <HI>then</HI> perhaps gathers &s;trength in
&s;ecret; that it may afford a better di&s;play of its colours in the
&s;pring.</P>
<P>I do not pretend this to be an adequate apo|logy. I know, my
deare&s;t friend, that you both <HI>like</HI> to &s;ee and hear from me: it
proves, however, <PB N="170" REF="189"> that you have no great <HI>lo&s;s</HI>
either of my letters or my company.</P>
<P>I am, as the phra&s;e is, deeply penetrated by the civilities of
your Mr. Miller. He took a &s;hort dinner with me once this &s;ea&s;on,
dropping Sir George at Mr. P&mdash;'s.&mdash;He could not have plea&s;ed me
better.&mdash;Here he happened to meet Mr. Lyttelton and Captain Whood. He
after|wards breakfa&s;ted here, and in general &s;eemed glad of every
occa&s;ion to bring me the genteele&s;t company. To him I owe Mi&s;s Banks and
Lord Temple. Can you think that Radway now, as well as Harbury, has no
attractions for me? You know me too well; but I have not truly &s;uch a &s;tate
of health as to dare to be from home. Friends will &s;ay 
<Q REND="inline">"you may be as free at our hou&s;es as your own,
&amp;c."</Q> and they will <HI>mean</HI> as they <HI>&s;ay;</HI> but if you
cannot make <HI>your&s;elf</HI> &s;o, what is all this to the purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>I cannot give you a detail of what has pa&s;&s;ed with me &s;ince I
&s;aw you. Lord Dudley, with my&s;elf, made one vi&s;it to Lord Plymouth's. We
met Mr. and Mrs. Winnington.&mdash;We took a trip to Mr. Vernon's, where we
found Mr. Coventry and other company. The impre&s;&s;ions I received from them
would afford &s;ubject for <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> betwixt you and me; but I
mu&s;t not a&s;&s;ign too much of my paper to that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord Plymouth's piece of water &s;hould have been a &s;erpentine
river. I could give you &s;trong rea&s;ons.&mdash;I think my Lord &s;uch a
character as will make a reputable figure in life:&mdash;<HI>beloved</HI> he
<HI>is,</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be at fir&s;t &s;ight.&mdash;Lady Plymouth is
the mo&s;t amiable of women; and, of all the world, the propere&s;t per&s;on
that my Lord could have cho&s;en. The plan for their hou&s;e I think right;
&s;uppo&s;ing it right to continue it where it is. The park is capable of
&s;ome con&s;iderable beauties. Lord Plymouth has been once here 
<PB N="171" REF="190"> &s;ince, and talks of cau&s;ing me to come, and de&s;ign
for his environs.&mdash;I &s;eem to be highly in his favour.&mdash;I hope
&s;ome time to meet you there.</P>
<P>My Ode, after an a&s;toni&s;hing delay, was pre|&s;ented to the
Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et.&mdash;It produced me two genteel letters from her
Grace. I am well &s;atisfied with the event, for &s;ome rea&s;ons, which I will
one day give you&mdash;none of mo|ment.&mdash;Soon after this, Dod&s;ley
pre&s;&s;ed me to contribute, as amply as I plea&s;ed, to a fourth volume of
his Mi&s;cellanies. I at fir&s;t meant to do &s;o pretty largely; I then
changed my mind, and &s;ent only &s;ome little pieces. Part of the&s;e were my
own; part Mr. Whi&s;tler's, Mr. Graves's, and &s;ome accidental pieces of
others, which I found in my bureau.&mdash;I purpo&s;ed to &s;end &s;omething of
yours too; of <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if I was <HI>hurried</HI>; el&s;e, not without
your con&s;ent. What I thought of was, your Linnets. La&s;t week he writes me
word, that the town will now be too much engro&s;&s;ed by the bu&s;ine&s;s of
elections; and that he does not proceed this winter.&mdash;So that we &s;hall
now, you &s;ee, have time to meet, or write upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Graves &s;ent me the enclo&s;ed little, fable, for Dod&s;ley, if
I approved it.&mdash;I made &s;ome al|terations, and &s;ent it.&mdash;Return it
to me, if you plea&s;e.&mdash;It is pretty; but the in&s;cription mu&s;t be 
<Q REND="inline">"To a Friend."</Q></P>
<P>Some corre&s;pondence I have had this winter with Mr. Hylton, about
toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in London. He is by far a better
<HI>friend</HI> and <HI>corre&s;pondent</HI> than a <HI>poet.</HI> Should you
take a trip to town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>I am now, like the re&s;t of the world, peru|&s;ing Sir Charles
Grandi&s;on.&mdash;I know not whe|ther that world <HI>joins</HI> me, in
preferring Clari&s;&s;a. The author wants the art of <HI>abridgement</HI> in
every <PB N="172" REF="191"> thing that he has written, yet I am much his
admirer.</P>
<P>My dear friend! cheri&s;h and pre&s;erve your own vivacity, and let
not this phlegmatic epi&s;tle impair it. If occa&s;ion offers, call on me for
my <HI>own</HI> &s;ake; and believe you have not alive a more affectionate

Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>April 19, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long, long time, according to the com|putation of
friend&s;hip, &s;ince I had the plea|&s;ure of a line from you, and I write
chiefly to remind you of it; not with any hopes of af|fording you the
amu&s;ement of a &s;ingle minute. In truth, I have not &s;pirits for it. The
&s;everity, the duration, the &s;olitude, of this winter have well-nigh
exhau&s;ted them.&mdash;The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of
pain and plea&s;ure becomes every day more clear to me. It begins to &s;eem as
ordinary as the cour&s;e of day and night. Thus my la&s;t &s;ummer was the
mo&s;t amu&s;ing I ever &s;aw; my winter the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable. Allow me to
accept one only: I mean, that ever-mourn|ful winter which robbed me of my
deare&s;t rela|tion. Sometimes this pain and plea&s;ure are contra&s;ted within
the compa&s;s of a day. Some|times, in different weeks, &amp;c. &amp;c.
However, do not think me &s;uper&s;titious. There is hardly a per&s;on that is
<HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;o. Yet I am firmly per&s;uad|ed of the alternation, either
in the mind, or in the events them&s;elves. My &s;ummer, I &s;aid be|fore, was
highly entertaining; my winter render|ed <PB N="173" REF="192"> equally
di&s;agreeable, by a long-continued &s;quabble among&s;t our principal
pari&s;hioners, and by the death of my be&s;t-beloved and the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed of my relations, M&mdash; D&mdash;. She ri&s;qued going to
London for the &s;ake of finding &s;omething <HI>new</HI>; was &s;eized with
the &s;mall-pox, and died in all her bloom.&mdash;The natural con&s;e|quence
which we &s;hould draw from ob&s;ervations of this &s;ort is, equanimity; 
<Q REND="inline">"aequam memento rebus, &amp;c."</Q> and again, 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;perat infe&s;tis me|tuit &s;ecundis,
&amp;c."</Q> Enough of this, which I &s;hould not mention, but that the fact
it&s;elf &s;trikes me continually more and more; and were I to mark the
plea&s;ing and unplea&s;ing parts of my exi&s;tence in an almanac, as the
Romans did their <HI>Fa&s;ti</HI> and <HI>Nefa&s;ti,</HI> I know not if, at the
year's end, the black and white marks would not nearly balance each other.</P>
<P>I have bought Hogarth's Analy&s;is: it is really entertaining; and
has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ad|ju&s;ted my notions with regard to beauty in
ge|neral. For in&s;tance, were I to draw a &s;hield, I could give you rea&s;ons
from hence why the &s;hape was plea&s;ing or di&s;agreeable. I would have you
<HI>borrow</HI> and read it.</P>
<P>Grandi&s;on I cannot think equal to Clari&s;&s;a; though, were merit

<P>Jago has been fortunate for once; but the value of his livings

<P>If Mr. Whi&s;tler would give me a vi&s;it in the height of my
&s;ea&s;on this year, I would look upon it as one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing

to hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of it.</P>
<P>My love of toys is not quite exhausted.&mdash;I have purcha&s;ed, or
rather renovated, &s;ome that are both rich and beautiful, though &s;hort of

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy account of our dear friend Whi&s;tler's death was
conveyed to me, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, by yours and by his brother's letter.
I have written to his brother this po&s;t: though I am very ill able to write
upon the &s;ubject, and would willingly have waved it longer, but for decency.
The trium|virate which was the greate&s;t happine&s;s, and the greate&s;t
pride, of my life is broken! The fabric of an ingenuous and di&s;intere&s;ted
friend&s;hip has lo&s;t a noble column! yet it may, and <HI>will,</HI> I
tru&s;t, endure till one of us be laid as low. In truth, one can &s;o little
&s;atisfy one's &s;elf with what we &s;ay upon &s;uch &s;ad occa&s;ions, that I
made three or <PB N="175" REF="194"> four e&s;&s;ays before I could
<HI>endure</HI> what I had writ|ten to his brother.&mdash;Be &s;o good as to
excu&s;e me to him as well as you can, and e&s;tabli&s;h me in the good opinion
of him and Mr. Walker.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Whi&s;tler! how do all our little &s;trifes and bickerments
appear to us at this time! yet we may with comfort reflect, that they were not
of a <HI>&s;ort</HI> that touched the <HI>vitals</HI> of our friend&s;hip; and
I may &s;ay that we fondly loved and e&s;teemed each other, of ne|ce&s;&s;ity. 
<Q REND="inline">"Tales animas <HI>oportuit</HI> e&s;&s;e
concordes."</Q> Poor Mr. Whi&s;tler! not a &s;ingle acquaintance have I made,
not a &s;ingle picture or curio&s;ity have I purcha&s;ed, not a &s;ingle

have had his approbation and his amu&s;ement in my eye. I will a&s;&s;uredly
in&s;cribe my larger urn to his memory; nor &s;hall I pa&s;s it without a
plea&s;ing melancholy during the remainder of my days. We have each of us
received a plea|&s;ure from <HI>his</HI> conver&s;ation, which no other
conver&s;ation can afford us at our pre&s;ent time of life.</P>
<P>Adieu! my dear friend! may our remem|brance of the per&s;on we have
lo&s;t be the &s;trong and everla&s;ting cement of our affection! A&s;&s;ure
Mr. John Whi&s;tler of the regard I have for him, upon his <HI>own</HI>

opportunity. Whether you have or no, believe me to be ever mo&s;t

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>particulars</HI> relating to our poor friend's departure
occa&s;ioned me much concern, and indeed &s;ome tears: yet as <HI>tho&s;e</HI>
particulars are what one covets to hear, and the melan|choly which they produce
is never unmixed with plea&s;ure, I think my&s;elf much obliged to you for the
care you took to convey them. It is po&s;&s;ible, the letters I wrote to you
and Mr. J. Whi&s;tler might appear too tender from a <HI>mere</HI> friend of
the decea&s;ed; but there is a &s;ympathy betwixt friends, which is not always
found among&s;t relations; nor does <HI>kindred</HI> imply
<HI>friend|&s;hip</HI> a whit more than <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> does
<HI>kindred.</HI> It is not many weeks ago, that I had a bill filed again&s;t
me in Chancery by young D&mdash;, the only near relation I have by the mother's
&s;ide; and the next in lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to my &s;hare of the Penn's
e&s;tate.&mdash;Do not let this &s;urprize you. I believe the affair will be
accommodated.&mdash;He only wanted to procure a divi&s;ion of the Harbo|rough
e&s;tate at a large expence, which might be better adju&s;ted without
<HI>any</HI>; in other words, to run his head again&s;t a &s;tone-wall, that he
might have a chance of cau&s;ing it to tumble upon <HI>me.</HI> Would you
con&s;ent that I &s;hould &s;uffer him to have the man&s;ion-hou&s;e at
Harborough thrown into his lot? Were I &s;o to do, I could make it advantageous
to my&s;elf, and the di&s;pute were at an end; but I have a kind of romantic
venera|tion for that <HI>place</HI> and <HI>family</HI>; which, if you
re|member, I have expre&s;&s;ed in one of my be&s;t elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegy xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="196">Pray what will become of our letters to Mr.
Whi&s;tler? as I am not con&s;cious of any thing di&s;honourable in mine (and I
am <HI>&s;ure</HI> I may &s;ay the &s;ame of yours) methinks I could wi&s;h
that they might not be de&s;troyed. It is from a few letters of my own or
others alone, acciden|tally pre&s;erved, that I am able to recollect what I
have been doing &s;ince I was born.</P>
<P>I met, when I was la&s;t at Barrels, a &s;urgeon of Bath, who&s;e
name, I think, was Cleland. He knew your name and place; but, I find, was not
per&s;onally acquainted with you.&mdash;I am glad enough to hear that your
place gets into vogue. It is, I think, what you &s;hould <HI>chu&s;e,</HI> upon
all accounts. Let the beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its
<HI>owner.</HI> I have often thought, my&s;elf, that were a per&s;on to live at
The Lea&s;ows, of more merit than my&s;elf, and a few degrees more worldly
prudence, he could &s;carce want opportunities to procure his own ad|vancement.
My rural embelli&s;hments are per|haps more con&s;iderable than yours; but then
the vicinity of Bath might occa&s;ion you a greater conflux.&mdash;Your
unexpen&s;ive illuminations plea&s;e me highly.&mdash;I have purpo&s;ed the&s;e
many years to purcha&s;e a &s;et of tin lamps, of about four-pence a-piece, to
&s;tick again&s;t trees, and to u&s;e upon occa&s;ion in my coppice; or rather
in my grove, where &s;ome of the water-falls would not fail to &s;hew
delightfully.</P>
<P>You a&s;ked me about Jago's preferment. The living <HI>la&s;t
given</HI> him by the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter is, I believe, near an hundred
pounds a year.&mdash;With this, he has Harbury of about fifty; and
Che&s;lerton, a &s;ort of chapel of ea&s;e, about forty; in the <HI>whole,</HI>
therefore, about a hundred and ninety: but then he is obliged to keep a curate;
and what I think yet wor&s;e is, that he cannot make it <HI>convenient</HI> to
<HI>live</HI> at his new &s;ituation, which is a pretty one.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="197">I have had &s;ome vi&s;itants this &s;ea&s;on;
indeed as many, and as con&s;iderable, as &s;uch a &s;ort of &s;ea&s;on could
afford me. A Scotch peer called upon me in his way through Birmingham: his
title was &mdash;. He &s;eemed to have a very clear head, a very polite and
ea&s;y manner, and all the refinement of true ta&s;te, <HI>without</HI> the
warmth or appetite.&mdash;I could not help thinking him, on many accounts,
characteri&s;tic of the Scotti&s;h na|tion.</P>
<P>Would to God I could &s;ee you and Mrs. Graves here this &s;ummer! I
have the &s;ame wi&s;h it may be <HI>my</HI> lot to vi&s;it <HI>you,</HI> next
autumn. Be a&s;&s;ured, I <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> it.</P>
<P>I expect Dod&s;ley every week. He will, I am convinced, be for
publi&s;hing his Mi&s;cellany next winter. Would Mr. W&mdash;, think you,
agree, that you and I &s;hould be allowed to publi&s;h &s;uch of poor Mr.
Whi&s;tler's papers there, as we judged were mo&s;t likely to do credit to his
memory?</P>

<HEAD>LXIX. To the &s;ame, on hearing that his Letters to Mr.
<HI>Whi&s;tler</HI> were de&s;troyed.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Oct. 23, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is certainly &s;ome argument of a <HI>peculiarity</HI> in the
e&s;teem I bear you, that I feel a readine&s;s to acquaint you with
<HI>more</HI> of my foibles, than I care to tru&s;t with any other per&s;on. I
believe no|thing &s;hews us more plainly either the different <HI>degrees</HI>
or <HI>kinds</HI> of regard that we entertain for our &s;everal friends (I may
al&s;o add the <HI>difference</HI> of their <HI>characters</HI>) than the
ordinary &s;tyle and tenour of the letters we addre&s;s to them.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to <HI>you,</HI> that I am con&s;iderably morti|fied by
Mr. John W&mdash;'s conduct in regard to my letters to his brother; and, rather
than they &s;hould have been &s;o unnecce&s;&s;arily de&s;troyed, would have
given more money than is allowable for me to mention with <HI>decency.</HI> I
look upon my letters as &s;ome of <HI>my</HI> chef-d'oeuvres; and, could I be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to propriety of &s;tyle or
&s;entiment, I &s;hould ima|gine it mu&s;t appear, principally, in my letters
to his brother, and one or two more friends. I con&s;idered them as the records
of a <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> that will be always <HI>dear</HI> to me; and as the
<HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of my <HI>mind</HI> for the&s;e twenty years la&s;t pa&s;t.
The amu&s;ement I &s;hould have found in the peru&s;al of <PB N="180" REF="199"> them would have been altogether innocent; and I would gladly have
pre&s;erved them, if it were only to explain tho&s;e which I &s;hall pre&s;erve
of his brother's. Why he &s;hould allow either <HI>me</HI> or <HI>them</HI>
&s;o very little weight as not to <HI>con&s;ult</HI> me with regard to them, I
can by no means conceive. I &s;uppo&s;e it is not <HI>uncu&s;tomary</HI> to
return them to the &s;urviving friend. I had no an&s;wer to the letter which I
wrote Mr. J. W&mdash;. I received a ring from him; but as I thought it an
inadequate memorial of the friend&s;hip which his brother had for me, I gave it
to my &s;ervant the moment I received it; at the &s;ame time I have a neat
&s;tandi&s;h, on which I cau&s;ed the lines Mr. W&mdash; left with it to be
in&s;cribed; and which appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer.</P>
<P>I have read your new production with plea|&s;ure; and as this letter
begins with a confe&s;&s;ion of foibles, I will own, that through mere
lazi|ne&s;s I have &s;ent you back your copy, in which I have made &s;ome
era&s;ements, in&s;tead of giving you my rea&s;ons on which tho&s;e
era&s;ements were founded. Truth is, it &s;eems to me to want mighty few
variations from what is now the pre&s;ent text; and that, upon one more
peru&s;al, you will be able to give it as much perfection as you mean it to
have. And yet, did I &s;uppo&s;e you would in&s;ert it in Dod&s;ley's
Collection, as I &s;ee no rea&s;on you have to the contrary, I would take any
pains about it that you &s;hould de&s;ire me. I mu&s;t beg another copy, at
your lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;hould like the in&s;cription you mention upon a real
&s;tone-urn, which you purcha&s;e very rea|&s;onable at Bath; but you mu&s;t
not ri&s;que it up|on the va&s;e you mention, on any account what|ever.</P>
<P>Now I mention Bath, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that I have received
intelligence from the younger Dod&s;ley, that his brother is now there, and
that <PB N="181" REF="200"> none of the papers I &s;ent him are yet <HI>&s;ent
to pre&s;s</HI>; that he expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth of
November, when he proceeds with his publication. Po&s;&s;ibly you may go to
Bath whil&s;t he is there, and, if &s;o, may chu&s;e to have an interview.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end two or three little pieces of my own, in hopes that
you will adju&s;t the reading, and return them as &s;oon as you conveniently
can. All I can &s;end to-night is this

de&s;ire your opinion as to the manner of <HI>placing</HI> what is &s;ent. The

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>June 16, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to pronounce my &s;entence upon the long &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
our corre&s;pon|dence, I &s;hould impute the blame of it, in al|mo&s;t
<HI>equal</HI> mea&s;ure, to <HI>your&s;elf</HI> and to <HI>me.</HI> To
<HI>you,</HI> for an omi&s;&s;ion of the letter you <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> me,
when la&s;t in town; to me, for waiting in ex|pectation of it, and for
neglecting to do <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to the &s;entiments of my heart on the
occa&s;ion of your late preferment. Great were the hopes I had indeed
conceived, that your increa&s;e of re|venue had been accompanied with a place
of re|&s;idence which was more <HI>to your mind</HI> than that 
<PB N="182" REF="201"> where you at pre&s;ent abide; but I do not find by any
accounts that you purpo&s;e to leave Har|bury; for which, no doubt, you have
rea&s;ons which I do not yet penetrate; but which may demand my a&s;&s;ent the
moment you di&s;cover them. I have but little to &s;ay of the life I have led
&s;ince you received &s;ome account of me from Mr. Hyl|ton in London. The
Winter, or at lea&s;t its <HI>mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> continued to tyrannize during
the <HI>minority</HI> of Spring; and the Spring has alike been &s;low in giving
up the reins to Summer. Of con&s;e|quence, I &s;eem in a &s;ort of middle
&s;tate, betwixt a dull half-animated grub, and an in&s;ignificant loco-motive
fly. Neither in the <HI>one</HI> &s;tate or <HI>other</HI> am I of the lea&s;t
importance; but, from the ad|vances which I have <HI>already</HI> made, you are
<HI>&s;ome|what</HI> the more likely to find me in your garden. About a
fortnight ago I received a line or two from our intimate acquaintance and
&s;chool-fel|low Mr. Hall. It was brought me by Sir Ed|ward Boughton's
gardener; a fellow of good ta&s;te, to whom Mr. Hall de&s;ired I would cau&s;e
The Lea&s;ows to be &s;hewn. I find you have de|lighted Mrs. Hall by &s;ome
alterations which you propo&s;e for their environs, and which they tho|roughly
re&s;olve to put in execution. When I come over into Warwick&s;hire, as I hope
to do &s;oon, I &s;hall be very glad to make them a vi&s;it in your company. My
&s;pirits, though far from good, are better, in the main, than they were in
winter; and, on &s;ome peculiar days, are rai&s;ed as high as to <HI>alacrity:
very</HI> &s;eldom higher; &s;el|dom &s;o high.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t (from hence at lea&s;t) take matters in the order or
rather <HI>di&s;order</HI> in which they occur: Mr. Miller I &s;aw on
Wedne&s;day la&s;t in Lady Lyttelton's coach, who &s;topped two minutes at my
gate on her return from London. I enquired concerning you; but could gather no
intelligence.&mdash;Mr. Hylton, who is now in Warwick&s;hire (if 
<PB N="183" REF="202"> he have not &s;trolled to London) has been with me
&s;everal months this &s;ummer. He is adding a room or two to his place, which
lies very near me; and purpo&s;es to re&s;ide there as &s;oon as it is
fini&s;hed. The &s;ituation is not void of beauties; but, if you will pardon
the vanity, mu&s;t veil its bonnet to mine. I have heard of planting hollies,
pyracanthas, and other berry-bearing greens, to attract tho&s;e Black-birds
which you have &s;o ef|fectually celebrated: it &s;hall be <HI>my</HI> ambition
to plant good neighbours; and, what with Lord Dudley and his exotics, Mr.
Hylton with his fo&s;&s;ils, and my&s;elf with my <HI>ferme orn&eacute;e,</HI>
is there not &s;ome room to expect that we may attract the ta&s;ters this way?
but fir&s;t we mu&s;t take &s;ome care to <HI>adverti&s;e</HI> them where their
trea&s;ures lie.&mdash;Another day is pa&s;&s;ed, and Mr. Miller, &amp;c. has
again been with me, and waked me out of a &s;ound &s;leep to
breakfa&s;t.&mdash;He mentions with what reluctance he <HI>left</HI> a
&s;urveyor at Radway, em|ployed in taking plans of the field of battle near
Edge-hill. This he purpo&s;es to enrich with a number of anecdotes, gleaned
from his neighbourhood; which mu&s;t probably render it extremely entertaining:
and &s;urely Edge-bill fight was never more unfortunate to the nation, than it
was lucky for Mr. Miller. He prints, to|gether with this plan, another &s;heet
of Radway Ca&s;tle. I approve his de&s;ign. He will, by the&s;e means, turn
every bank and hillock of his e&s;tate there, if not into
<HI>cla&s;&s;ical,</HI> at lea&s;t into <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> ground.</P>
<P>I have done mighty little about my grounds &s;ince la&s;t winter. As
indolence has on <HI>many</HI> oc|ca&s;ions contributed to <HI>impair</HI> my
finances, it is but ju&s;t that it &s;hould &s;ometimes contribute to
<HI>re&s;tore</HI> them. Yet I am not quite de&s;titute of &s;omething new for
your amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Of late I have neither <HI>read</HI> nor <HI>written</HI> a
&s;yl|lable. What plea&s;ed me la&s;t was Hogarth's Ana|ly&s;is. 
<PB N="184" REF="203"> I expect Dod&s;ley down every week; and as he will

truly poetical, and his &s;entiments altogether liberal and ingenuous.</P>
<P>I am, at pre&s;ent, a &s;urveyor of roads: em|ployed in repairing my

&mdash;his <HI>de&s;igns</HI> as well as his <HI>per|formances</HI> at
Lappa!&mdash;how glad &s;hould I be to &s;ee you! yea, I would hardly fail to
return with you to Harbury; were you to add this one obligation. I left Mr.
Miller in doubt whether he would not &s;ee me at Radway &s;ome time next week.
Evil and capricious health (the particu|lars of which would make a detail of no
im|portance) de&s;troys all my punctuality, and bids me promi&s;e with
<HI>fear.</HI> You, I tru&s;t, are mo&s;tly at home; and were you to be at
Snitterfield, I would follow you without reluctance. So, with hopes to &s;ee
you &s;hortly, either in Warwick|&s;hire or Shrop&s;hire, I relinqui&s;h the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have re&s;erved a very melancholy &s;ubject for the la&s;t. May

friend&s;hip, which has lo&s;t a very beautiful column in poor Mr. Whi&s;tler!
he died of a &s;ore throat, which in a few days time turned to an inward
mortifi|cation.&mdash;I will &s;ay no more on the occa&s;ion: very affecting
has it been to me.&mdash;God pre&s;erve your life, your happine&s;s, and your
friend&s;hips! and may you ever be <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> of <HI>that</HI> with
which I am, dear Sir,</P>

<P>Shall I beg a line from you, as &s;oon as may be?&mdash;I do,

<P><PB N="185" REF="204">I am given to under&s;tand that I may expect
a vi&s;it this &s;ummer from the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; from Lord Ward, Lord

&s;ort,</HI> which would formerly have affected me, perhaps <HI>too</HI>
deeply, have now lo&s;t much of their wonted poignancy. Can <HI>&s;uch</HI>

Mr. Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole Briti&s;h Peerage.</P>
<P>Something el&s;e I have to &s;ay. Young Pixell la&s;t winter told

<P>I have been of late much bent upon the encrea&s;e of

<HEAD>LXXII. To Mr. JAGO, on their contribution to <HI>Dod&s;ley's</HI>
Mi&s;cellanies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;owes, 
<DATE>Jan. 22, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;ure you mu&s;t be puzzled how to ac|count for my &s;ilence,
after the honour you have done me by your ver&s;es, and the reque&s;t you made
that I would <HI>write.</HI>&mdash;I am al&s;o as much at a lo&s;s how to give
a proper weight to my apology. To &s;ay I have been ill, would per|haps imply
too much: when I would only al|lude to that &s;tate of heavine&s;s and
dejection which is &s;o frequently my lot at this time of the year; and which
renders me both <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to writ|ing, and utterly di&s;&s;atisfied
with every thing that I <HI>do</HI> write.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="207">IF at any time my head grew a little le&s;s
con|fu&s;ed than ordinary, I was obliged to devote my attention to the affair
in which I had &s;o <HI>fooli&s;hly</HI> involved my&s;elf with Dod&s;ley. You
are unable to conceive what vexation it has given me: I could not endure to
<HI>di&s;appoint</HI> him: of con&s;e|quence, it has been my lot to &s;tudy the
delica|cies of <HI>poetry</HI> when my brain was not &s;ufficient to indite a
piece of common pro&s;e; but as the <HI>Mou&s;e</HI> (by which I mean my
<HI>own</HI> performances) will &s;o &s;oon make its ridiculous appearance, it
were totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours of the
<HI>Mountain.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t letter I re|ceived from you left me
greatly di&s;&s;atisfied. I was then to &s;end D&mdash; my <HI>final</HI>
in&s;tructions in a po&s;t or two.&mdash;You took little notice of any query I
made; and intimated a di&s;approbation which agreed <HI>too well</HI> with my
own internal &s;en|timents. I knew not but you were <HI>angry</HI> at the
<HI>liberties</HI> I had taken; though I could have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed any
&s;ingle paper which I had then con|veyed to London.&mdash;Little did I
<HI>then</HI> imagine that it was in my power to have protracted the affair
till <HI>now.</HI> Had that been the ca&s;e, I &s;hould have troubled you with
repeated emba&s;&s;ies; for I abhor the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the po&s;t, and my
&s;er|vants do little at this time of the year, that is of more importance than
their ma&s;ter's poetry.</P>
<P>Your next letter convinced me, that you had taken no offence: and
&s;o far I was happy; but then I wanted to have your Gold-finches as cor|rect
as your Black-birds; there were <HI>&s;ome</HI> things I wi&s;hed you to alter;
and others in regard to which I was de&s;irous to &s;peak my
<HI>&s;entiments.</HI> Add to this my own <HI>ver&s;es,</HI> with which I was
in|finitely <HI>more</HI> di&s;&s;atisfied. Why then did I not write?&mdash;The
true rea&s;on was, that I was pre&s;&s;ed by D&mdash; to &s;end conclu&s;ions
every po&s;t; and though I have had all this lei&s;ure (as it <HI>happens</HI>)
&s;ince you wrote, I never could <HI>depend</HI> upon <PB N="189" REF="208">
more than the &s;pace of a day or two. Be&s;ides, critici&s;ms in the way of
letter are extremely te|dious and di&s;&s;atisfactory; in&s;omuch, that I am
thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future, unle&s;s I have
the company of my friends when I &s;end to the pre&s;s Hur|ried as I then was,
I &s;ent up your two copies, and what I propo&s;ed for him of my own, with a
kind of <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> power to &s;elect the be&s;t readings. How you
would approve of this mea&s;ure I knew not; but I had this to plead in my
behalf, that D&mdash; was a per&s;on of ta&s;te <HI>him&s;elf</HI>; that he
had, as I imagined, many learned friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; that his
<HI>intere&s;t</HI> was concerned in the per|fection of his Mi&s;cellany; and
that I &s;ubmitted my own pieces to the &s;ame judgement.</P>
<P>After all, I am but indifferently &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of the&s;e contributions. D&mdash; writes ju&s;t &s;o much as he deems
<HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, and pa&s;&s;es by a
thou&s;and points in my letters which de&s;erve an an&s;wer. His la&s;t
acquaints me, that he has &s;pent a whole day in the arrangement of what I have
&s;ent him; and that he purpo&s;es to &s;end me <HI>proof-&s;heets</HI> before
the clo&s;e of this week, de&s;iring I would &s;end them back by the return of
the po&s;t. Whether they arrive on Saturday or on Monday, I can keep them till
the Thur&s;day following.</P>
<P>And this brings me, in the la&s;t place, to the main purpo&s;e of
this letter.&mdash;It is a reque&s;t on which I lay great &s;tre&s;s; and which
you mu&s;t not refu&s;e me upon almo&s;t any con&s;ideration.&mdash;I beg, in
&s;hort, that you would promi&s;e me the favour of your company on Monday (or
even Tue&s;day next, if po&s;&s;ible; and let us jointly fix the readings of
<HI>your</HI> pieces, of my <HI>own,</HI> and tho&s;e of our common
<HI>friends.</HI>&mdash;You will immediately comprehend the <HI>expediency</HI>
of this; now, in par|ticular, that our names are to appear. <HI>Some</HI>
alterations I think <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in your Gold-finches, 
<PB N="190" REF="209"> and there are two or three &s;tanzas which I think you
might improve.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I will not pretend that this journey is
&s;o <HI>requi&s;ite</HI> upon your <HI>own</HI> account as <HI>mine</HI>; and
will recommend it upon no other footing than the plea&s;ure you will receive by
the obligation which you will confer.</P>
<P>I thought to have concluded here; but, as an envelope is now become
altogether nece&s;&s;ary, have a temptation to proceed which I did not &s;ee
before.</P>
<P>It is now become Friday the twenty-fourth of January. The packets I
&s;end, and the reque&s;t that I make upon &s;o <HI>little</HI> warning, will,
at fir&s;t, a&s;toni&s;h you.&mdash;Unfore&s;een interruptions would not
&s;uffer me to di&s;patch my courier &s;ooner.&mdash;What then remains, but
that I endeavour to ad|ju&s;t this affair agreeably to its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>
circum|&s;tances?</P>
<P>You will readily conceive from what you ob|&s;erve in my packets,
how de&s;ireable your com|pany is to me at this juncture. Suppo&s;ing it then
in your <HI>power</HI> to come over on Monday, Tue&s;day, or even Wedne&s;day,
I am inclined to believe you <HI>will.</HI> Suppo&s;ing it <HI>not</HI> &s;o, I
can fore&s;ee you will not have lei&s;ure to &s;atisfy my queries by the return
of the bearer; and what I would <HI>next</HI> propo&s;e is, that you would
either &s;uffer me to &s;end again to you betwixt this time and Thur&s;day
next; or that you would your&s;elf di&s;patch a purpo&s;e-me&s;&s;enger, and
allow me to pay for his journey.&mdash;In either of the&s;e <HI>latter</HI>
ca&s;es, I am &s;ure you &s;o well know the nature of my pre&s;ent
irre&s;olution, that you will endeavour to afford me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
you are able.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;ows, 
<DATE>Feb. 22, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from Dod&s;ley, dated the fifteenth of February;
informing me that you were then in town, had been with him, and left your
directions whether he might &s;end you a &s;et of Mi&s;cellanies.</P>
<P>February the twentieth, and not <HI>before,</HI> arrived young
H&mdash; with your letter; very obliging|ly intended to give me previous notice
of your journey; but which, by the iniquity of chance, tended only to acquaint
me with an opportunity which I had <HI>lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing could have been &s;o fortunate as your journey to
London, had Mr. H&mdash; thought proper to bring your letter in due
time.&mdash;What excu&s;e he made for his neglect, or whether he made any, I
have really forgot. This I know, that the whole affair has been unlucky. There
has been abundant time for con&s;ultation, and a perfect &s;eries of
opportunities of which we have not been &s;uffered to avail
our&s;elves.&mdash;It is now three weeks or a month &s;ince I corrected the
proof-&s;heets; was &s;o hurried in the doing of it that I &s;carce knew what I
wrote; and yet, in &s;pite of all this hurry, the book is hitherto
un|publi&s;hed. <HI>Now,</HI> indeed, it mu&s;t be much too late for
alterations, as D&mdash; has given me &s;ome room to expect a book this very
day.&mdash;I know but little what he has done in con&s;equence of that
di&s;cretionary power with which I, through ha&s;te, was obliged to intru&s;t
him: but in what I have done, <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> you may expect to find all the
effects of <HI>dulne&s;s precipitated.</HI></P>
<P>It is now the twenty-third of February, and I have received no
fre&s;h account of our friend <PB N="192" REF="211"> Dod&s;ley's proceedings;
nor am I able to <HI>trace</HI> them, as I expected, in the news-papers.</P>
<P>As to your &s;hare of this Mi&s;cellany, you can have no cau&s;e to
be di&s;&s;atisfied.&mdash;After what manner he has thought proper to print
Lady L&mdash;'s ver&s;es, I am a good deal uncertain; but I apprehend he has
not followed her own read|ings very preci&s;ely, and that the blame thereof is
to be thrown upon me.&mdash;I am concerned for the memory of my poor friend
Whi&s;tler; and regret that his <HI>better</HI> pieces did not fall into my
hands. I think that Dod&s;ley, however, would have done him greater ju&s;tice,
had he in&s;erted his tran&s;lation of 
<Q REND="inline">"Horace and Lydia."</Q> It is true, the
tran&s;lations of that Ode are out of num|ber; but <HI>his,</HI> if I mi&s;take
not, had many beau|ties of its own.&mdash;I do not know whether I ever hinted
to you, that <HI>his</HI> genius and that of Ovid were apparently
congenial.&mdash;Had he cultivated his with equal care, perhaps the
&s;imilitude had been as obvious as that of your twin-daughters.&mdash;Mr.
Graves has one &s;mall well-poli&s;hed gem in this collection; his ver&s;es
upon medals.&mdash;His little conjugal Love-&s;ong is al&s;o natural and
ea&s;y.&mdash;I <HI>told</HI> you what I lea&s;t di&s;liked of my <HI>own</HI>
puerilities.&mdash;If the printing of my Rural In&s;crip|tions be
<HI>invidious,</HI> it was altogether owing to the in&s;tigation of Sir
G&mdash; L&mdash;. There are four or five little matters, which, if he have
printed with my name, incorrect as they are, I &s;hall be utterly
di&s;con&s;olate; at lea&s;t, till I get &s;ight of a &s;ucceeding
impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;For though I am not much &s;olicitous about a poetical
reputation (and indeed it is of little importance to &s;o <HI>dome&s;tic</HI>
an animal as my&s;elf), yet I could ill endure to pa&s;s for an affected,
powerle&s;s <HI>pretender.</HI></P>
<P>And now no more upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;I have nothing to add that
can the lea&s;t amu&s;e you.&mdash;You, who have been conver&s;ant with all the
bu&s;y and the &s;plendid &s;cenes of life, can want <PB N="193" REF="212"> no
materials to make a letter entertaining.&mdash;In|deed you never
<HI>did.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall be glad, however, to receive a <HI>long</HI> one,
upon what &s;ubjects you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed a very dull and unamu&s;ive win|ter; my health
indeed rather better than I experi|enced it la&s;t year; but my head
<HI>as</HI> confu&s;ed, and my &s;pirits <HI>as</HI> low. I live in hopes of an
opportunity of &s;eeing you at Harbury; but I begin now to re|ceive vi&s;its as
an hone&s;t beggar does an alms, with my humble&s;t thanks for the favour, and
with a de&s;pair of making a return.</P>
<P>Perhaps my next letter may di&s;cover &s;ome|what more

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;o long expected the favour of a few lines from you, that I
begin at la&s;t to que&s;tion whether you received the letter I &s;ent you. It
was inclo&s;ed in one to Mr. M&mdash;, whom I reque&s;ted to further it with
all conve|nient expedition. I am neither able to recollect the whole contents
of it; nor indeed, if I <HI>were,</HI> could I endure the thoughts of
tran&s;cribing them. The chief intention of it, however, was to ac|quaint you
of Mr. H&mdash;'s unhappy delay in the delivery of that letter with which you
favoured me from Radway.</P>
<P>What confirms me in a &s;u&s;picion that my la&s;t letter
mi&s;carried, is, that Mr. Wren lately ac|quainted me of your being at Wroxall
upon bu|&s;ine&s;s, and of your making &s;ome &s;light mention

<PB N="193" REF="214"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="194" REF="215"> of Mr. Dod&s;ley's publication, without intimat|ing that
you di&s;covered any de&s;ign you had of writing to me. This is mere preamble
and &s;tuff: implying nothing more than the de&s;ire I have to <HI>hear</HI>
from you, when it ought al&s;o to expre&s;s how impatiently I long to
<HI>&s;ee</HI> you. Worldly concerns and my winterly &s;tate of health have
detained me at home for the&s;e many months pa&s;t; world|ly concerns may have
confined you likewi&s;e; but as your health and &s;pirits are univer&s;ally
better than mine, and as you have much le&s;s di&s;like to travelling than
my&s;elf, I would hope that my ab&s;ence from Harbury will never cau&s;e you to
<HI>neglect</HI> any <HI>opportunity</HI> of coming hither. For my own part, I
have been meditating upon a vi&s;it to you all this winter; and do, at this
time, re&s;olve mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly to perform it before June. But the many
&s;uch &s;chemes of plea&s;ure in which I have been di&s;appointed are a &s;ort
of check upon my expre&s;&s;ions, and make me pro|mi&s;e with <HI>fear.</HI> As
to Dod&s;ley's performance, which you mu&s;t have received before this time, I
will make no ob&s;ervations till I have the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing you: and
yet there are many points I would di&s;cu&s;s, and many accounts I want to give
you. So many indeed, that they would furni&s;h out perhaps a &s;uperficial
drawling letter; but would &s;erve infinitely better for conver&s;ation, with
the book before us. The volume, I am told, is well received in town; though
political intelligence mu&s;t engro&s;s much of its pre&s;ent attention.</P>
<P>Mr. Hylton is in my neighbourhood, and upon the point of &s;ettling
at his farm. Could you po&s;&s;ibly &s;pend a week with us, we would try to
make it agreeable. At all events, I beg to hear from you; and that, not merely
as it will afford me great plea&s;ure, but as, at the &s;ame time, it will
ea&s;e me of &s;ome &s;olicitude. I will not make this a long letter, though I
wi&s;h to receive a long <PB N="195" REF="216"> one in return; having a head
very little quali|fied to add any thing that may amu&s;e you, though a heart

made this enquiry, I was thinking to conclude; but cannot reconcile my&s;elf to
the <HI>novelty</HI> of &s;ending <HI>you</HI> three empty pages. The
Parliament will <PB N="198" REF="219"> ri&s;e too &s;oon for the publication of
my 
<Q REND="inline">"Rural Elegance;"</Q> and having performed my
promi&s;e to Dod&s;ley, I think no more about &s;uch <HI>laurels</HI> as the
<HI>public</HI> can be&s;tow upon me, but am giving all my attention to &s;uch
as I can purcha&s;e of my nur&s;ery-man. I wi&s;h, however, that the vo|lume
may recompen&s;e Dod&s;ley for his trouble: I may al&s;o add, for his
ingenuity, and for his politene&s;s in giving each of us a compleat &s;ett.
They are elegantly bound, and all as much alike as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent cri&s;is of &s;tate-affairs does not &s;eem to favour
his publication, as the attention of the public mu&s;t lean greatly to that
quarter. I &s;aw a letter from Sir William M&mdash; (who corre&s;|ponds with
Lady Luxborough) which placed the &s;truggles of the mini&s;try in a clearer
light than they had yet appeared to me. It &s;eems that per&s;ons of all
denominations are for carry|ing on the war with vigour; and the King's
ap|plication for a Vote of Credit was received with general approbation. The
zeal of the Parlia|ment was indeed &s;o remarkable on this occa&s;ion, that,
in&s;tead of the 600,000<HI>l.</HI> at fir&s;t intended, it was thought proper
to propo&s;e a million. But the &s;ervices were a&s;certained, and the
Chan|cellor of the Exchequer made accountable for the application of it. The
augmentation of the fleet with 20,000 &s;eamen; the rai&s;ing 5000 ma|rines on
a plan of dividing them into &s;mall com|panies, which will render them more
u&s;eful both by &s;ea and land; the completion and re|inforcement of the
Iri&s;h regiments; are the u&s;es to which this million is to be appropriated.
Mr. Fox and his land-war party &s;at mute, whil&s;t Mr. Legge with great
openne&s;s and per|&s;picuity explained the pre&s;ent &s;chemes; as they were
calculated, to exert our whole &s;trength at &s;ea, and, if po&s;&s;ible, no
where el&s;e. Mr. Dod|ington, who, it &s;eems, has not &s;poke for many years,
charmed every body. His wit did not <PB N="199" REF="220"> only entertain, but
animate and affect his hear|ers. 
<Q REND="inline">"It were better, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> than lo&s;e the

Pro|bably this, however, is not the la&s;t &s;eal that I &s;hall cau&s;e this

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE pa&s;&s;ed a very dull and unamu&s;ive winter here&mdash;the
wor&s;e, for being neither <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> nor <HI>qualified</HI> to keep
up a corre&s;pondence with my friends; with <HI>you,</HI> among the
<HI>chief</HI>; and yet, it is upon you that I mu&s;t depend to make up my
deficiencies with Mr. Dod&s;ley.&mdash;The poor man has been afflicted with the
mo&s;t <HI>la&s;ting</HI> fit of the gout he ever underwent before.&mdash;His
patience, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is inimita|ble. His excur&s;ion to the
<HI>Regions of Terror and Pity</HI> is not the only in&s;tance of his ability
to compo&s;e ver&s;es in the mid&s;t of pain. When he &s;ent me a copy of it,
he let me know, that he had tran&s;mitted another to you by the &s;ame po&s;t.
I &s;hould be glad to receive your remarks upon it, ere I communicate my own. I
have, for <PB N="202" REF="223"> &s;ome weeks pa&s;t, &s;ound my head &s;o
terribly confu&s;ed, that it has been with difficulty I could <HI>think</HI> or
<HI>expre&s;s</HI> my&s;elf on the mo&s;t &s;uperficial to|pic. I hope, in a
little time, to be able to exa|mine it more attentively than I can at
pre&s;ent: yet, in the mean while, mu&s;t acknowledge, that I think his
&s;ubject capable of furni&s;hing extraor|dinary beauties for an Ode: and
<HI>&s;uch,</HI> I think, he &s;hould <HI>call</HI> it; dropping the narrative
parts, and the connexions as much as po&s;&s;ible. I can|not wi&s;h him to
print it without very <HI>material</HI> al|terations; and what would occa&s;ion
almo&s;t the &s;ame trouble as it would require to <HI>new-write</HI> it. I do
not mean this as a condemnation of what he has already done; &s;o much, as a
proof of my opinion how much he will he able to improve it. <HI>After all,</HI>
it will &s;carce affect me half &s;o &s;o much as his Tragedy. He is &s;o
<HI>hone&s;t</HI> a man, that the work he has to give the world is much better
than the &s;pecimen: or to borrow an idea from <HI>my &s;ituation,</HI> the
grain that he has to deliver will prove much better than the &s;ample. It is
with &s;hame I acknowledge I have not yet &s;ent him his epilogue; and I feel
the greater com|punction of mind upon this &s;core, as it is po&s;&s;ible he
may impute my neglect to Garrick's refu&s;al of his play. This weighs nothing
with you or me; a thou&s;and motives may affect a manager, that have little or
nothing to do with the merit of the performance; yet he may &s;o far thank Mr.
Garrick, that whatever his refu&s;al takes from the <HI>reputation</HI> of his
Tragedy, it will, through Dod&s;ley's indu&s;try, add apparently to its value.
I have not yet been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with every part of your
epilogue, and mu&s;t either omit &s;ending it at pre&s;ent, or mu&s;t &s;end
him an imperfect copy. If you write to him, let me beg you to give the mo&s;t
favourable account you <HI>can</HI> of me.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="224">Somebody acquainted me (I think it was Mr.
Talbot,) that your old friend Ballard had be|queathed you his coins for a
legacy. I was truly glad to hear it; but have wondered &s;ince, that you never
once informed me of &s;o con&s;iderable an acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>I remember a poem of yours, called &mdash;, upon the pre&s;ent

as of any other little pieces that you have in your bureau. Some of yours
de&s;erve a better place than what is a&s;&s;igned them in the Magazine. In
particular, I remem|ber that upon Enigmas, and Mop&s;y. Be a&s;&s;ured, I will
make no <HI>u&s;e</HI> of <HI>any</HI> without your previous con&s;ent. You
know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that Dod&s;ley's other Mi&s;cellanies do not appear before
next winter.&mdash;I have received from him, together with his Ode, a few
Elegies publi&s;hed by Mr. Whitehead. They are, I think, worth your peru&s;al;
and de&s;igned by my worthy friend to excite my emulation. Alas! that I am &s;o
ill able to de&s;erve the encouragements which I re|ceive from him!</P>
<P>My neighbour Ba&s;kerville, at the clo&s;e of this month publi&s;hes
his fine edition of Virgil. It will, for <HI>type</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> be a

<P>What think you of their management in re|gard to Mr. Byng? I cannot

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend Dod&s;ley's Ode, I &s;ent
him the la&s;t po&s;t. I would gladly have occa&s;ioned them to pa&s;s by
Claverton; but, having delayed them &s;o long, I was impatient to convince him
that I had not <HI>wholly</HI> di&s;regarded his reque&s;t. They are indeed
pretty copious; and yet I have re&s;erved to my&s;elf the privilege of
re-critici&s;ing when I &s;ee his altered copy. I recommended to him the
addition which you propo&s;ed, and &s;ome others; and if he will but take the
pains that I have chalked out for him, I doubt not that he will render it an
excellent Ode, though he may not find it a very <HI>popular</HI> one. I have
al&s;o &s;ent him a copy of our epilogue, not much different from what you
&s;aw; to the&s;e I added my little Ode on Lady Luxborough's furni&s;hing her
libra|ry, and Perry's Ver&s;es upon the Malvern-waters. At the clo&s;e of
the&s;e la&s;t, there appears (with Perry's approbation,) a &s;hort addre&s;s
to Dr. Wall of Worce&s;ter; a very eminent phy&s;ician, and the patron of this
mineral, who has pro|moted a &s;ub&s;cription in the county towards
<HI>building,</HI> near this well, for the accommodation of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;e al&s;o to give Dod&s;ley the little Ode I inclo&s;e, and
would beg the favour of you to <PB N="205" REF="226"> advi&s;e me concerning
the additional &s;tanzas' fix the readings in the re&s;t, and to return me the
copy.</P>
<P>I come now to analyze your remark on Bal|lard's legacy; which is
indeed very ingenious, but will &s;carce bear examination: nor do I think that
you rather wi&s;h to have <HI>found</HI> that &s;et of medals, than to have
them <HI>given</HI> you by a de|cea&s;ed friend. A&s;&s;uredly, if we do not
allow plea&s;ure to be <HI>predominant</HI> in this kind of melan|choly, we
de&s;troy the foundation of all tragic or elegiac writings. Melpomene has no
place among&s;t the Mu&s;es; and the pains that we have taken with our friend
Dod&s;ley's pen&s;ive Ode have been employed to no purpo&s;e. But you want not
the&s;e pedantic flouri&s;hes, and are wholly of my mind.</P>
<P>Martin's Magazine is, I believe, pretty ob|&s;cure; and I wonder
where you got a &s;ight of it. It was, however, fortunate enough for
<HI>me</HI> that you gave no copy of 
<Q REND="inline">"James Daw&s;on."</Q> I ne|ver yet &s;aw your
ver&s;es <HI>on that Grotto,</HI> or from <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> and I want to
&s;ee your W&mdash; once more, concerning which you are &s;ilent. Your 
<Q REND="inline">"Pep|per-box"</Q> and 
<Q REND="inline">"Mop&s;y"</Q> might, I think, ap|pear in Dod&s;ley's
Mi&s;cellany, either <HI>with</HI> or <HI>without</HI> your name. I al&s;o want
a copy of your ver&s;es upon Riddles; and whenever you have a lei&s;ure hour,
&s;hould be glad if you would look them out and &s;end them.</P>
<P>Go, and think your&s;elf an happy man; at lea&s;t, if your children
be recovered, as I am in|clined to think they are; and give my &s;ervice to
Mrs. Graves, for the happine&s;s that &s;he occa&s;ions you; of which I cannot

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK God, I have recovered a tolera|ble degree of health this
&s;pring; though by no means free from &s;o much heavine&s;s and la&s;&s;itude,
as renders me aver&s;e to all activity of body and mind. In the cour&s;e of my
di&s;order, &s;o long as I could bear to think of <HI>any</HI> &s;ublunary
enjoyment, I remembered my friends, and of cour&s;e thought much of
<HI>you</HI>; but its advances were &s;o precipi|tate, when I &s;ent for the
phy&s;icians, that I &s;oon received a <HI>wrench</HI> from every object of
this world; and it was by &s;low degrees, even after my recovery, that my mind
took &s;o much root again, as appears nece&s;&s;ary for its immediate
&s;up|port. I &s;uppo&s;e you have been informed that my fever was in great
mea&s;ure hypochondriacal; and left my nerves &s;o extremely &s;en&s;ible,
that, even on no very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, I could readily think my&s;elf
into a vertigo: I had almo&s;t &s;aid an epilep&s;y; for &s;urely I was
oftentimes near it.&mdash;It became, therefore, expedient for my recovery, to
amu&s;e my&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t trivial objects I could
find; and this kind of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s I have indulged till it is grown into
an habit. Even letters to my friends are hardly con&s;i&s;tent with my rule of
health; <PB N="209" REF="230"> yet I could be no longer &s;ilent with regard to
<HI>you,</HI> without feeling a &s;en&s;ation that would hurt me <HI>more.</HI>
This may fairly enough be termed the fir&s;t <HI>letter</HI> I have wrote
&s;ince my recovery; wherein if I &s;hould tell you one half that I am inclined
to do, relating to this dreadful illne&s;s, what room &s;hould I then leave to
&s;peak on any other &s;ubject? I mu&s;t, therefore, tell the&s;e things by
word of mouth, or write them &s;ome other time. The journies which my friends,
and in|deed phy&s;icians, propo&s;e for me, are what cer|tainly bid faire&s;t
for the completion of my cure: yet there are many, many things, which how|ever
unfit for the ta&s;k, I mu&s;t endeavour to ad|ju&s;t before I can leave home,
with any po&s;&s;ibili|ty of enjoyment. Need I mention any other than my
cur&s;ed embarra&s;&s;ment with D&mdash;? who, during my <HI>danger,</HI> was
induced to &s;top proceed|ings; but is now beginning law afre&s;h, and, by the
removal of tenants from <HI>his</HI> &s;hare of the Harborough e&s;tate, has
now wriggled him&s;elf into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t one half of
<HI>mine.</HI> However, I am not without hopes of &s;eeing all terminated in a
little time; nor entirely without a pro&s;pect of &s;eeing you at Claverton
this &s;um|mer. That you may think this the more pro|bable, I am pre&s;&s;ed by
two young gentlemen, whom I very much e&s;teem to accompany them on a vi&s;it
to Mr. Bamfylde in Somer&s;et&s;hire. The&s;e two gentlemen are Mr. Dean and
Mr. Knight. Perhaps you may have heard of Mr. Bamfylde, who is very much at
Bath; is there now with his lady, or has left the place but lately; and who&s;e
fortune, per&s;on, figure, and accompli&s;hments, can hardly leave him long
un|noticed in any place where he re&s;ides. Yet my vi&s;it to E&s;tercomb
mu&s;t be of &s;econdary con&s;e|quence to me, whil&s;t you live by the
road-&s;ide. I am much obliged to you for your compliment on my Poematia in
Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellanies; <PB N="210" REF="231"> which came very
&s;ea&s;onably, con&s;idering how I had been mortified by the fir&s;t &s;ight
of what was done. To &s;peak the truth, there are many things appear there very
contrary to my intenti|ons; but which I am more de&s;irous may be at|tributed
to the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of my fever, than to my friend D&mdash;'s
precipitation. My purpo&s;e was to acknowledge as <HI>mine,</HI> none of the
pieces which now follow the longer Ode to La|dy Luxborough. Her name was
actually era&s;ed; as al&s;o my own at the clo&s;e of your Fable. The ver&s;es
by Mrs. Bennet to Mr. Richard&s;on were ab&s;olutely new to me; were my name
occurs again. All this is again&s;t me; as a thing in it&s;elf invidious to
have one's name recur &s;o often, and as my <HI>own lines contradict</HI> the
merit which my friends &s;o liberally allow me.&mdash;The ver&s;es of mine in
the &s;ixth volume (which was printed be|fore the fifth) were printed without
my know|ledge; and when I &s;ent up an improved copy, it arrived a good deal
too late. As things hap|pen, I am made to own &s;everal things of inferior
merit to tho&s;e which I <HI>do not</HI> own&mdash;All this is again&s;t me;
but my thoughts are avocated from this edition, and wholly fixed upon a future;
wherein, I hope, Dod&s;ley will be prevailed upon to omit &s;ome things al&s;o
from <HI>other</HI> hands which di&s;credit his collection: and, to balance
<HI>all my di&s;comforts</HI> on this head, the world will know that I am
e&s;teemed by a per&s;on, whom I e&s;teem &s;o much as you.&mdash;I know not
how it happens, but the ta&s;te for humorous poetry does not prevail at this
time: yet I cannot agree with Mr. J. Warton, that it is no poetry <HI>at
all,</HI> any more than that a good repre&s;entation of Dutch boors is not a
picture.&mdash;His brother, the Pro|fe&s;&s;or, is to be here with his pupil
Lord Done|gal, &amp;c. this &s;ummer.&mdash;Mr. Spence and Mr. Dod&s;ley will
&s;tay a day or two here this month in their way to Scotland; and Mr. Home, the
<PB N="211" REF="232"> author of Douglas, &amp;c. called on me and we &s;pent
an evening together at Admiral Smith's. Thus my <HI>ferme orn&eacute;e</HI>
procures me interviews with per&s;ons whom it might otherwi&s;e be my
<HI>wi&s;h,</HI> rather than my good fortune to &s;ee. Would to God, it could
attract <HI>you,</HI> whom I more long to &s;ee than any one! and let me tell
you, there were con&s;iderable additions made to it la&s;t year: Dod&s;ley's
pre&s;ent of Faunus; a new Gothic-building, or rather a &s;kreen, which co&s;t
ten pounds; and the ruins of a Priory, which, however, make a tenant's hou&s;e,
that pays me tolerable poundage.&mdash;I am growing a little into <HI>your</HI>
ta&s;te, why &s;hould not you ad|vance farther into <HI>mine?</HI> I mean, I
have a love for medals, by means of &s;ome that have been given me: yet do not
think that I &s;hall ever ri|val. <HI>you.</HI>&mdash;My object is only
<HI>beauty,</HI> and I love only tho&s;e of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip: &s;o
that this is no more a rival&s;hip than that of two per|&s;ons who admire the
&s;ex, but love different individuals; a rival&s;hip, which, I tru&s;t, is more
likely to cement our friend&s;hip than di&s;unite us; which it is my
<HI>conviction</HI> and my <HI>comfort</HI> no <HI>&s;ort</HI> of rival&s;hip
will ever do. I have hardly room to expre&s;s my good wi&s;hes for long health

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great anxiety when I reflect how long I have waited for
the &s;atisfaction of a line from you. I beg, if you are alive and well, you
will let me know &s;o by the next po&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Dod&s;ley and Mr. Spence have been here and &s;tayed a week with
me. The former was in certain hopes of &s;eeing you in town; but I do not find
that he either &s;aw or heard from you, which <HI>adds</HI> to my anxiety.</P>
<P>I have &s;een few whom I liked &s;o much, upon &s;o little
acquaintance, as Mr. Spence; extreme|ly polite, friendly, chearful, and
ma&s;ter of an infinite fund of &s;ubjects for agreeable conver&s;a|tion. Had
my affairs permitted me, they had certainly drawn me with them into Scotland;
whither they are gone, for about a month, upon a journey of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I believe it will give you plea&s;ure to hear that my law-&s;uit
with D&mdash; is accommodated, by the generous interpo&s;ition of my Lord
Stamford; concerning who&s;e benevolence and magnanimity it is impo&s;&s;ible
for me to &s;peak in the terms which they de&s;erve. It is ended, I hope, not
very <HI>di&s;advantageou&s;ly</HI> for me; apparently with <HI>one</HI>
advantage, of being intirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind. The
common me|thod (as M. Bruyere ob&s;erves) is to condemn <HI>both</HI> on
the&s;e occa&s;ions.&mdash;This &s;uits people's in|dolence, and favours their
impartiality.&mdash;And though the equitablene&s;s of my whole conduct in this
affair was &s;elf-evident to all that were near me, yet I found many that were
inclined to blame us <HI>both,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome</HI> that I could never
convince till <HI>now</HI> that the fault was not <HI>wholly</HI> mine.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="234">Your

<DATE>Nov. 25, 1758.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from you the&s;e two months;
con&s;cious, how|ever, that I did not de&s;erve any; and affording a manife&s;t
in&s;tance of of the infatuations of &s;elf-love. The la&s;t letter that I
received of yours is dated the clo&s;e of July, &s;ince which time I have been
chiefly engaged in my cu&s;tomary amu&s;e|ments; embelli&s;hing my farm, and
receiving the company that came to &s;ee it. My principal
<HI>ex|cur&s;ions</HI> have been to Enville, on Lord Grey's birth-day; to Lord
Ward's, upon another invi|tation; and to the Worce&s;ter Mu&s;ic-meeting. I
need not mention what an appearance there was of company at Worce&s;ter;
dazzling enough, you may &s;uppo&s;e, to a per&s;on who, like me, has not
&s;een a public place the&s;e ten years. Yet I made a &s;hift to enjoy the
&s;plendour, as well as <PB N="214" REF="235"> the mu&s;ic that was prepared
for us. I pre&s;ume, nothing in the way of harmony can pa&s;&s;ibly go further
than the Oratoria of The Me&s;&s;iah. It &s;eems the be&s;t compo&s;er's be&s;t
compo&s;ition. Yet I fancied I could ob&s;erve <HI>&s;ome parts</HI> in it,
where|in Handel's judgment failed him; where the mu&s;ic was not equal, or was
even <HI>oppo&s;ite,</HI> to what the words required. Very many of the
noble&s;&s;e, whom I had &s;een at The Lea&s;owes, were as complai&s;ant to me
as po&s;&s;ible; whereas it was my <HI>former</HI> fate, in public places, to
be as little regarded as a journeyman &s;hoe-maker.&mdash;There I fir&s;t &s;aw
our pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop; al&s;o our late Bi&s;hop's monument, which is
fine.&mdash;La&s;tly, there I fir&s;t &s;aw my Lady Coventry; to whom, I
believe, one mu&s;t allow all that the world al|lows in point of
beauty.&mdash;She is certainly the mo&s;t <HI>unexceptionable</HI> figure of a
woman I ever &s;aw; and made mo&s;t of the ladies there &s;eem of almo&s;t
another <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> On the whole, I was not a little plea&s;ed that I
had made this excur|&s;ion; and returned with double reli&s;h to the
<HI>en|joyment</HI> of my <HI>farm.</HI> It is now high time to take &s;ome
notice of your obliging letter.&mdash;I think I was not told the purport of the
journey you made to London; &s;o can only &s;ay, I am very &s;orry for the
aggravating circum&s;tances of your di&s;ap|pointment; and hope, long before
this time, that Mrs. Graves is quite recovered.&mdash;Did I for|get to make
your excu&s;es to Dod&s;ley or no?&mdash;he was here (as I remember) &s;oon
after, with Mr. Spence, in their way to Scotland.&mdash;Mr. Spence, the man
<HI>you</HI> would like, and who would like <HI>you</HI> of all mankind. He
took my Elegies into Scot|land, and &s;ent them back on his return, with a
&s;heet or two of critici&s;ms, and an hand&s;ome let|ter.&mdash;How much am I
intere&s;ted in the pre&s;er|vation of his friend&s;hip;&mdash;and yet &s;uch
is my <HI>de&s;tiny</HI> (for I can give it no other name.) I have never wrote
to him <HI>&s;ince.</HI> This <HI>impartiality</HI> of <PB N="215" REF="236">
my neglect, you mu&s;t accept <HI>your&s;elf</HI> as <HI>&s;ome</HI> apo|logy:
but to proceed; Mr. Spence cho&s;e him|&s;elf an oak here for a &s;eat, which I

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will think my &s;ilence long; and I &s;hould be &s;orry to
<HI>have</HI> you quite regard|le&s;s of it; although, I fear, it mu&s;t be my
fate to tre&s;pa&s;s frequently upon your kind &s;olicitude.&mdash;I have no
excu&s;e to make, be&s;ides &s;ome frivolous avocations, and <HI>much</HI> of
that heavine&s;s and la&s;&s;i|tude which di&s;inclines one to write
letters.&mdash;I pa&s;&s;ed the former part of winter with more vi|vacity than
I did the latter, or even the incipient &s;pring; owing, po&s;&s;ibly, to
the&s;e cold winds, which will not permit me to u&s;e my wonted exerci&s;e. You
will laugh at the word <HI>vivacity,</HI> when applied to &s;o dull an animal;
but I &s;peak comparatively of that unmeaning drow&s;ine&s;s which is my lot at
other times, and <HI>was,</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort, while you were here.</P>
<P>Mr. Dod&s;ley tells me, he received a letter from you, acquainting
him that Cleone would be played at Bath: I &s;hould be glad to receive from you
any particulars of its &s;ucce&s;s. He is publi&s;h|ing an elegant edition of
it, which I expect by this very po&s;t. The new plate of my grove, which will
appear at the end of his Melpomene, is perhaps liable to &s;ome exceptions;
but, by much, the be&s;t that has yet appeared. Do not forget to &s;end me your
objections to it. As to <PB N="222" REF="243"> the epilogue, I have totally
bani&s;hed, I think, every one of the lines which he <HI>&s;ub&s;tituted</HI>;
have left to him the choice of two or three readings for the four la&s;t lines;
and though none of them quite plea&s;e me, yet the epilogue, on the whole,
di&s;covers more of genius, is more &s;pirited, and le&s;s inaccurate. I
&s;hall be glad to find that you think the &s;ame with me.</P>
<P>In regard to your place, &s;o far as I can form an idea of it, I
would have you con&s;ult <HI>&s;elf</HI>-amu&s;e|ment; I mean, without too much
regard to what <HI>others</HI> &s;ay or think. As to di&s;tingui&s;hing your
ingenuity (which I unfeignedly de&s;ire you may) the pre&s;s affords you more
<HI>adequate</HI> materials than either your fortune or, perhaps, your place.
Do not imagine, however, that I &s;hall not be much delighted with every
&s;troke I trace of yours at Claverton. My faculties are very &s;trongly
in|tuitive in re&s;pect of every thing belonging to you: and I &s;hould be
a&s;hamed if any nook or angle that you had rounded; any wall that you had
ruina|ted; any &s;tream that you had diverted; or any &s;ingle &s;hrub that you
had planted; &s;hould elude my di&s;covery: yet you will &s;hine <HI>more</HI>
by means of the pre&s;s; and if I &s;aid any thing concerning your &mdash;,
that did not <HI>encourage</HI> you to perfect it, I am &s;ure, I mu&s;t u&s;e
terms very inexpre&s;&s;ive of my meaning. Without any more words, let me
<HI>intreat</HI> you to proceed with it; give a <HI>full &s;cope</HI> to your
imagination; and if there &s;hould be aught one would wi&s;h
<HI>retrenched,</HI> it is mighty <HI>ea&s;ily done.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed <HI>thoughts</HI> (for I <HI>never</HI> u&s;e the word
<HI>re&s;olutions</HI>) of publi&s;hing my Elegies next winter;&mdash;you will
gain&s;ay, when I tell you my intention of publi&s;hing al&s;o my very farm; at
lea&s;t, about eight or ten &s;cenes taken from it, by way of top|and
tail-pieces for tho&s;e elegies.&mdash;The world will perhaps tax my vanity;
but I do not in the lea&s;t <PB N="223" REF="244"> care.&mdash;The plea&s;ure
which that world gives me, I am very con&s;cious, will not be too
<HI>high</HI>; and I am determined that the pain it may &s;eek to give &s;hall
bear proportion: yet &s;hould I be &s;orry to obtrude &s;tuff upon it, either
from the pencil or the pen; and my good friend Mr. Dod&s;ley has &s;ometimes
pained me, not a little.</P>
<P>I tell you, you <HI>cannot</HI> allow for winter.&mdash;That very
&s;cene near Priory-gate &s;hews not a bit of road in <HI>&s;ummer</HI>; though
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a firm rail there would add to my own
tranquilli|ty&mdash;Mr. Knight has given me Strange's prints, which, I hear,
are fine. Dod&s;ley gives me &s;wans; but for the&s;e two months pa&s;t I have
been a librarian, or rather a bookbinder; yet nothing more

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DEPEND upon it, I &s;hall &s;ee Claverton before winter.&mdash;The
mi&s;chief is, that, with as violent a propen&s;ity as ever per&s;on felt, I
&s;hall not be able to reach your hemi&s;phere, while Mr. Spence, Mr.
Dod&s;ley, and Mr. Whitehead give it &s;uch peculiar lu&s;tre, in my eyes. This
I did not de&s;pair of doing at the time Mr. Dod&s;ley left me at Birmingham.
It turned upon an event, which I did not indeed explain to him, the
accommodation of the affair with D&mdash;; which concerns near one half of my
little fortune, and which, if I have any luck on my &s;ide, mu&s;t 
<PB N="224" REF="245"> now be perfected within a fortnight. I was &s;hewn the
rough &s;ketch of our <HI>conveyances</HI> la&s;t Saturday.&mdash;Once for all,
my <HI>indolence</HI> is not in fault; my health and my worldly
embarra&s;&s;ments <HI>have</HI> often been &s;o, and at pre&s;ent
<HI>are.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pol me mi&s;erum, patrone, vocares, &s;i verum,

<P>Dod&s;ley, to give his book eclat, &s;hould allow him&s;elf time to
<HI>abridge</HI> and <HI>poli&s;h.</HI> It is not enough in my opinion, merely
to &s;urpa&s;s L'E&s;|trange and Croxall. The grand <HI>exception</HI> to
Fables con&s;i&s;ts in giving <HI>&s;peech</HI> to animals, &amp;c. a greater
<HI>violation</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> than appears in any other kind of writing!
This objection is in&s;ur|mountable. Their peculiar <HI>advantage</HI> is to
re|move the offen&s;ivene&s;s of advice; in order to which, one &s;hould
perhaps pur&s;ue a medium betwixt the &s;uperfluous garniture of La Fontaine,
&amp;c. and the naked &s;implicity and laconi&s;m of Phaedrus. In re&s;pect of
his own new-invented Fables, I wi&s;h him to devi&s;e uncommon &s;ubjects, and
to inculcate refined morals. But pray &s;end me <HI>your</HI> two directly,
which will an&s;wer all that I expect in Fables.</P>
<P>Did Mr. Dod&s;ley tell you of the &s;eat in my &s;hrubbery which I
had taken the freedom to in|&s;cribe to you? I could not <HI>&s;atisfy</HI>
my&s;elf in an in&s;cription; and, from a kind of &s;pleen and aver&s;ion to

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WANT no conviction of the plea&s;ure which you will receive from
the termination of my infernal law&s;uit. It mu&s;t, if I have <HI>any</HI>
luck, be finally adju&s;ted in about nine days time; after having robbed me of
my peace for <PB N="228" REF="249"> &s;ix of the be&s;t years of my life.
During the <HI>for|mer</HI> part of life, I langui&s;hed for an acquaintance
&s;omewhat more exten&s;ive; and when the com|pany that flocked to &s;ee my
place removed all grounds of <HI>that</HI> complaint, this accur&s;ed di&s;pute
aro&s;e, and mixed with every enjoyment that was offered me.&mdash;I have
&s;ometimes found entertain|ment in balancing the good and evil that has been
allotted me in general; and have in the end imagined the good prevalent, and
that I have great rea&s;on to be thankful for more happine&s;s than I
de&s;erve.&mdash;Yet are there many awkward circum&s;tances that forbid the
<HI>&s;cale</HI> to fall <HI>precipi|tately</HI>; among the chief, I place the
di&s;tance to which I &s;ee you and one or two others removed. This is indeed
an heavy article, and, were it not for letters, would be in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Dod&s;ley's collection of Fables, you are mi&s;taken if
you think that I peru&s;ed the quar|to book. I dipped into it here and there,
and thought there wanted <HI>much</HI> alteration. There was a little book with
a paper-cover, on which I be&s;towed no &s;mall pains; and when I had &s;o
done, cro&s;&s;ed the Fables which I thought might well enough pa&s;s mu&s;ter.
Addi&s;on would have been the be&s;t writer of Fables of any author I
know&mdash;the purity of &s;tyle&mdash;the conci&s;ene&s;s&mdash;the dry
humour&mdash;and the familiar manner.&mdash;As to Dod&s;ley's publi&s;hing this
winter, he may po&s;&s;ibly do &s;o, without lo&s;s of credit; but when one
con|&s;iders that they are, or ought to be, the &s;tandard for years to come,
one can hardly avoid wi&s;hing him to give them the poli&s;h of another
&s;ummer. 'Twas fortunate that you pitched upon 
<Q REND="inline">"The Raven and Magpie"</Q> to tran&s;cribe for me;
as Mr. Dod&s;ley had &s;ent me 
<Q REND="inline">"The Sun-flower and the Tubero&s;e"</Q>
<HI>before.</HI> I think the la&s;t &s;omewhat inferior, but will re-con&s;ider
it before I write again. The Fable which I literally tran&s;lated 
<PB N="229" REF="250"> from Phaedrus was 
<Q REND="inline">"The Wolf and the Crane,"</Q> in order to give
Dod&s;ley an idea on <HI>what</HI> Rollin laid the &s;tre&s;s in Fables.</P>
<P>As to the in&s;cription, I will endeavour to ad|ju&s;t it to your
mind&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Meriti&s;que reconditiori|bus"</Q> may do, but is
not explicit enough. I want fully to expre&s;s a character that &s;hines
remarka|bly among &s;elect acquaintance, and yet (through extreme refinement)
makes le&s;s figure in the pub|lic eye.</P>
<P>I had made the &s;ame objection to Burke's chapter upon
<HI>words</HI>&mdash;and yet there &s;eems to be &s;omething right in it. Du
Bos (which I have only &s;een in <HI>French,</HI> but which I believe is al&s;o
tran&s;lated) con&s;i&s;ts of three volumes, 12mo. His &s;ubjects are
plea&s;ing, and his knowledge may be entertaining; but his genius &s;eems not
very pro|found, from the little that I have con&s;ulted in him.</P>
<P>Dod&s;ley is <HI>preci&s;ely</HI> what you &s;ay of him; an object
of e&s;teem and love, and in &s;ome <HI>degree</HI> of admiration. His
<HI>ear</HI> does not wholly plea&s;e me in writing, and yet he is intimately
affected with mu&s;ick.&mdash;Lord L&mdash;'s ear is perhaps the rever&s;e. I
mean, he does not much regard mu&s;ic, yet writes harmoniou&s;ly in ver&s;e and
pro&s;e.</P>
<P>Robert&s;on I think to buy&mdash;Butler al&s;o, though I &s;hall not
admire him&mdash;Lord Clarendon, when I am <HI>rich</HI>&mdash;Ra&s;&s;elas has
a few refined &s;entiments thinly &s;cattered, but is upon the whole below Mr.
J&mdash;. Did I tell you I had a letter from John&s;on, inclo&s;ing Vernon's
Pari&s;h-clerk? Pray take Dod&s;ley's advice in regard to your &mdash;; and
heighten the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of your <HI>heroe,</HI> which <HI>his</HI> kind
of <HI>lunacy</HI> will countenance, yet admit him to &s;ay good
things.&mdash;But do not make any alteration in the narrative of your own
&s;to|ry&mdash;at lea&s;t, till I have again peru&s;ed it&mdash;Do not &s;purn
this fifty pounds. It will procure you <PB N="230" REF="251"> numerous
conveniences, which you would per|haps otherwi&s;e deny your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed four or five days, betwixt this week and la&s;t,
at my Lord Ward's at Hinley.&mdash;This has furni&s;hed me with franks,
be&s;ide the con&s;olation I derive from <HI>having paid</HI> a vi&s;it of
<HI>this kind.</HI> It is 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;pinis &egrave; pluribus <HI>una</HI> &s;altem
ex|empta."</Q> The <HI>re&s;traint</HI> renders them <HI>&s;pinae.</HI> I hope
I may &s;ay &s;o without umbrage, or giving an appearance of di&s;re&s;pect.
For Mr. W&mdash; is an agreeable man, and my reception was very polite.</P>
<P>I have three or four more of the&s;e &s;uperb vi|&s;its to make, and
which I may not omit without giving real offence. To Lord Plymouth, next week;
Lord Stamford's, the week after; then to Lord Lyttelton, at our Admiral's; and
then to Lord Foley, if your friend Dr. Charleton will accompany me; then,
&amp;c. alas! alas! 
<Q REND="inline">"Quid me exempta juvat &s;pina?"</Q> I mu&s;t
conclude upon a &s;eparate paper. That your <HI>expectation</HI> may not
<HI>deceive</HI> you in regard to the plan I promi&s;ed, I inclo&s;e a &s;urvey
of my farm reduced to minia|ture by a neighbouring arti&s;t. Let me know if it
bring the place to your memory&mdash;I think to have a plate (which may be done
at Birmingham for &s;ix or eight &s;hillings) that &s;hall leave me no trouble
but to tinge the impre&s;&s;ions with colours; in order to give my friends. But

&s;omething on each &s;ide, as I remember, that puts one in mind of a
porridge-pot boiling over beneath the pot-lid. The appearance of the hou&s;e
and the back-ground is better; this was adju&s;ted by the painter; the other
(as I think Smith told me) by an old hou&s;e-&s;teward of Lord T&mdash;'s.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to regulate my compliments by the arrival of <HI>times</HI>
and &s;ea&s;ons, I &s;hould congratulate you upon a <HI>corre&s;pondence</HI>
which now enters upon its three and twentieth year.&mdash;Our
<HI>frien&s;hip</HI> is of &s;omething older date; and is not this an
<HI>atchievement</HI> that de&s;erves the honour of a <HI>triumph</HI> both for
you and me too?&mdash;More, I am &s;ure, than the regular de&s;truction of
fifteen or twenty thou&s;and wretches in the field; con&s;ider|ing how
<HI>uncommon</HI> we find friend&s;hips of &s;o long a duration, and how
<HI>cheap</HI> we find &s;uch victories, not only on the Pru&s;&s;ian, but on
the Au&s;trian &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambridge (Scriblerus) who called here this autumn, was
con&s;idering this ma&s;&s;acre rather in a philo&s;ophical than political
view; and, in|deed, it does not appear to me that plague, earthquake, or
famine, are more pernicious to the human race, than what the world calls
Heroes; but enough of this.</P>
<P>Your want of lei&s;ure gives me pain; &s;urely, if I may gue&s;s by
one or two of your la&s;t letters, you have enlarged the number of your
&s;cholars, and extended your dome&s;tic cares, beyond what your
circum&s;tances <HI>require.</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t not judge of my painter's abilities by the &s;mall
&s;ketch I inclo&s;e.&mdash;I de&s;ired him to give me a <HI>&s;light</HI> one;
and have, perhaps, ruined even <HI>that</HI> by endeavouring to bring it nearer
to what the picture now <HI>is my&s;elf.</HI> It will give you a tolerable idea
in the mo&s;t points, except the Pan, which has his face turned towards the 
<PB N="235" REF="258"> front; and is not near &s;o con&s;iderable.&mdash;I
cho&s;e to have this <HI>term</HI> introduced, not only as he car|ries my
favourite reeds, but as he is the princi|pal <HI>&s;ylvan</HI> deity.&mdash;The
Water-nymph below has the word 
<Q REND="inline">"Stour"</Q> on the mouth of her urn; which in &s;ome
&s;ort, ri&s;es at The Lea&s;owes. On the &s;croll is, 
<Q REND="inline">"Flumina amem &s;ylva&s;que inglorius"</Q> alluding
to them <HI>both.</HI>&mdash;The Pan, you will per|haps ob&s;erve, hurts the
<HI>&s;implicity</HI> of the picture&mdash;not much, as we have managed him;
and the intention here is, I think, a balance.</P>
<P>The dog on the other &s;ide is my faithful Lucy, which you perhaps
remember; and who <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>body</HI> than
&s;he perhaps would, if we had more room. However I believe, I &s;hall cau&s;e
her head to cut off that little clu&s;ter of angles, where the balu&s;trade
joins the ba&s;e of the arch. The balu&s;trade is an improvement we made the
other day: it is, I think, a great one; not only as it gives a &s;ymmetry or
balance to the curtain of which you complained; but as it ex|tends the
<HI>area</HI> on which I &s;tand, and &s;hortens the <HI>length</HI> of this
<HI>half-arch.</HI> The painter objected to a tree; I know not why; unle&s;s
that we could introduce no <HI>&s;tem</HI> without encroaching too much upon
the land&s;cape: but the rea&s;on be gave was, it would be an injury to the
face.&mdash;The con|&s;ole is an Apollo's head. The impo&s;t does not go
further than the pila&s;ter, which ends the cor|ner; and here the drawing is
erroneous.&mdash;We are, I think, to have a carpet, though we know not well how
to manage it.</P>
<P>And now, I mu&s;t tell you the dimen&s;ions.&mdash;The figure
it&s;elf is three feet, three inches and a half; the whole picture four feet,
eleven inches, by two feet, three inches and three-quarters.&mdash;The colour
of the gown, a &s;ea-green; wai&s;tcoat and breeches, buff-colour; &s;tockings,
white, or rather pearl-colour; curtain a terra-&s;ienna, or 
<PB N="236" REF="259"> very rich reddi&s;h brown.&mdash;I think the whole will
have a good effect; but be&s;eech you to &s;end me your opinion
<HI>directly.</HI> There are &s;ome things we can alter; but there are others
we mu&s;t not.</P>
<P>Your &s;hall have one of the &s;ize you de&s;ire in the &s;pring;
but will you not calculate for &s;ome one place in your room? The painter takes
very &s;trong likene&s;&s;es; is young; rather daring than delicate in his
manner, though he paints well in enamel; good-natured; &s;lovenly; would
im|prove much by application. Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD not under&s;tand, by Mr. Dod&s;ley's la&s;t letter to me,
that he had any <HI>&s;ort</HI> of in|tention to publi&s;h his Fables this
winter. Pre|&s;uming upon this delay, and having neither had the
<HI>lei&s;ure</HI> nor the <HI>frame</HI> of mind fit to take his preface into
con&s;ideration, I have hitherto de|ferred to do &s;o; and can only &s;ay in
<HI>general,</HI> that I could wi&s;h you had happened to be more co|pious in
your ob&s;ervations. La Motte's Di&s;cour&s;e on Fables is a mo&s;t excellent
performance; con|taining, as appears to <HI>me,</HI> all that need be &s;aid
upon the &s;ubject, and this expre&s;&s;ed with all imaginable elegance and
per&s;picuity. I believe I &s;hall advi&s;e our friend D&mdash; to make more
am|ple u&s;e of this di&s;&s;ertation. There is a tran&s;lati|on of La Motte
into <HI>pro&s;e,</HI> which is altogether <HI>below contempt;</HI> and yet,
for aught I know, the <PB N="237" REF="260"> <HI>only</HI> one. The word
<HI>naive</HI> is very probably <HI>that</HI> for which he has &s;ub&s;tituted
the word <HI>lively</HI>; though by no means of &s;imilar import.
<HI>Natural</HI> approaches nearer it; but according to La Mot|te is not
preci&s;e: and, as the words <HI>Naif</HI> and <HI>Naivet&eacute;</HI> &s;eem
of late to become more in vouge, I will here give you an extract of what he
&s;ays upon the &s;ubject:

<P><PB N="238" REF="261">And now, let me know what Engli&s;h word you
would employ to interpret <HI>Naif. Sentimen|tal</HI> has &s;ome preten&s;ions;

<P>I bought the quarto edition of La Motte's Fables, to which this
e&s;&s;ay is prefixed; though the vaunted cuts which tempted me to this
ex|travagance did not an&s;wer my expectation. The author, with much addre&s;s,
begs the Duke of Orleans to be at the expence of them; which, to the be&s;t of
my remembrance, was 
<Q REND="inline">"deux mille ecus."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hurd, you &s;ee, is one of Dr. Warburton's Chaplains. I bought
his Dialogues Moral and Political, almo&s;t as &s;oon they were publi&s;hed.
Sir Edward Lyttelton told me, the introductory one would be omitted in the next
edition. The three following are very ingenious; but the two former are a
little ambiguous in regard to his in|tended moral: the two la&s;t are wholly
political, and I have not yet peru&s;ed them, though e&s;teem|ed the
<HI>be&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Have you &s;een Dr. Smith's 
<Q REND="inline">"Theory of Mo|ral Sentiments,"</Q> which is
prodigiou&s;ly commend|ed, and which I have bought, but not read?&mdash;You
will &s;ee an account of this in the Monthly Review.</P>
<P>I have lately been reading one or two volumes of The Rambler; who,
excepting again&s;t &s;ome few hardne&s;&s;es in his manner, 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He too often makes u&s;e of the Ab&s;tract
for the Concrete.</NOTE> and the want of more examples to enliven, is one of
the mo&s;t <HI>nervous,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>per&s;picuous,</HI> mo&s;t conci&s;e,
and mo&s;t harmonious pro&s;e-writers I know.&mdash;A learned diction improves
by time.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to find no mention of your &mdash; in all the letters
which I have received of late. Do not think of <HI>dropping</HI> or even
<HI>delaying</HI> the publi|cation of it; only, if you plea&s;e, before it goes
to <PB N="239" REF="262"> the pre&s;s, let me peru&s;e it once
deliberately.&mdash;What think you, if Dod&s;ley approve it, of ad|mitting cuts
into your &s;cheme?</P>
<P>And now, from <HI>cuts</HI> I proceed to <HI>pictures.</HI> Alcock's
portrait of me is in a manner fini&s;hed; and has been hung up for the&s;e nine
days pa&s;t, in its carved frame, oppo&s;ite to the fire place in my library.
<HI>They &s;ay</HI> it is a likene&s;s, allowing for the diminution of &s;ize.
Indeed, if I can conclude any thing from the &s;trong re&s;emblance which he
has produced of <HI>others</HI> here, I may form &s;ome <HI>conjecture</HI>
that he has not failed in mine.&mdash;Be this as it will, the picture is, upon
the whole a tolerably plea&s;ing one; and this is the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> I mu&s;t
dare to &s;ay, con&s;idering my own per&s;on makes &s;o large a part of it.</P>
<P>What think you of a tawney or reddi&s;h brown for the robe or
night-gown, with black for the wai&s;tcoat and breeches, re&s;erving green for
the curtain? though green is, with me at lea&s;t, no very gay colour, nor has
it that effect which you apprehended in the drapery. Terra-&s;ienna is a
delightful colour; &s;o, I think, is Roman ocre burnt. Let me know then, what
objections you have to the drapery ju&s;t now propo&s;ed. Let me know al&s;o
any de&s;ign that you think mo&s;t plea&s;|ing for a back-ground; or any
&s;tory of two or three figures, that would be &s;uitable for a relievo.</P>
<P>From <HI>pictures</HI> I proceed to <HI>painters.</HI> I believe,
Alcock would go and &s;ettle at Bath, if Amos Green could be induced to join
him. Amos Green is the name of the painter whom I recommended to you <HI>before
my fever.</HI> He is e&s;teemed inferior to no one in England for fruit. He
al&s;o paints flowers, in&s;ects, and dead-game, <HI>very</HI> well. To this he
would adjoin the bu&s;ine&s;s of water-painting. Alcock would paint portraits
in oil; and to this he would add enamel-painting: both of them 
<PB N="240" REF="263"> the be&s;t-natured young fellows in the world. Now
&s;uppo&s;e them al&s;o <HI>ingenious,</HI> and tell me whether they would have
a chance to <HI>thrieve</HI>?</P>
<P>You ought to have a very con&s;iderable <HI>amends,</HI> if you are
to be plagued with writing and with mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters.&mdash;I believe I rate
your time and trouble at a much higher price than you do your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Black&s;tone has rai&s;ed him&s;elf to a very eminent figure,
indeed, in the world of letters. I rejoice at it, without one particle of envy,
both as he is your friend, and a per&s;on of merit. I believe no one, be&s;ides
your&s;elf, would have dreamt of your odd analogy betwixt him and me.&mdash;I
know not <HI>how</HI> they came to in&s;ert that in|&s;ipid Song of mine in the
Chronicle.&mdash;What &s;en&s;ation it cau&s;ed in me, was that of
di&s;appro|bation; as it looked like laying &s;tre&s;s on what one knows to be
of no importance.</P>
<P>The chief points wherein my picture varies from your drawing is in
the corner below the ba&s;e of the pede&s;tal; where an antique va&s;e is
introduced with a flower and two or three leaves of the &s;carlet Geranium. The
gilt va&s;e agrees well enough with the gold fringe on the edge of the curtain;
but the whole is &s;o <HI>&s;ubdued,</HI> as not to catch the eye too
&s;trongly. It was chiefly meant to obviate the di&s;agreeblene&s;s of the
<HI>parallel</HI> lines and angles occa&s;ioned by the &s;tep in that corner;
but it crowds that &s;ide a little, if one look from top to bottom; and, though
a plea&s;ing object, it is hard to &s;ay whether it does more good or harm.</P>
<P>It is time now to take my leave, with my hearty re&s;pects to Mrs.

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s that I do not altogether find your argument
conclu&s;ive.&mdash;An hurry of bu|&s;ine&s;s <HI>may</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary,
and &s;omewhat incon|&s;i&s;tent with frequent corre&s;pondence; but a &s;tate

<HI>di&s;&s;ipation</HI>; which makes your pre&s;ent apology for not writing to
me before. And &s;o, betwixt bu&s;ine&s;s at one time, and di&s;&s;ipation at
another, I am to be defrauded of a corre&s;pondence that is quite e&s;&s;ential
to my well-being. Pardon me, if, on &s;uch occa&s;ion, you find me extremely
clear-&s;ighted in the foibles of my friends; and do not &s;ay with the man in
Horace, 
<Q REND="inline">"Cur in ami|corum vitiis, &amp;c."</Q> The
<HI>matter</HI> is too <HI>important</HI> for me to connive at any &s;ort of
&s;ophi&s;m.&mdash;How|ever, to make you ea&s;y on this head, I am con|vinced
the letter was owing to <HI>you</HI>; for which I will draw my apology neither
from <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> nor di&s;&s;ipation; and yet how ju&s;tly might I
palliate my long &s;ilence upon <HI>either</HI> footing! Since I wrote to you,
I have been <HI>bu&s;ied</HI> in bringing about a conclu&s;ion with D&mdash;.
The letters, journies, &amp;c. <HI>previous</HI> and <HI>po&s;terior</HI> to

excu&s;e.&mdash;The con&s;tant attendance upon workmen (of which I have

would produce more on the &s;core of <HI>di&s;&s;ipation</HI>&mdash;you
remember the place.&mdash;This, at pre&s;ent, is my chief employment, although

think it always was your ta&s;te.&mdash;Dod&s;ley comes hither in about a

Ba&s;kerville's pre&s;s and paper. <HI>Mean time,</HI> he is to <HI>give</HI>
me his picture done by Reynolds; and to <HI>&s;end</HI> me two bronzed
plai&s;ter urns, of about twelve inches, with ba&s;&s;o-relievo; and two
figures (ditto) of Homer and Virgil (of about twenty-one inches) for two niches
in my libra|ry The parcel is to be pieced out with Ogilby's Virgil, which I
want for the &s;ake of the land|&s;capes.&mdash;And now to the particulars of
your letter.</P>
<P>I can readily conceive how much greater plea&s;ure you mu&s;t
receive from the <HI>retinue</HI> of your journey, than an Archbi&s;hop can
from all his equipage; and I can truly a&s;&s;ure you, I find a plea&s;ure in

<P>Your room, indeed, will be a noble one; but be &s;ure remember the 
<Q REND="inline">"Imploravit opes hominis, fraenumque recepit,"</Q>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH this interval in our corre&s;pon|dence mu&s;t be placed, I
fear, to <HI>my</HI> account, you will hardly think it mends the matter, to
<HI>fill</HI> my pre&s;ent letter even with the be&s;t-ground|ed
apologies&mdash;I will only mention a bad &s;tate of health, which has been my
lot this winter, as a general excu&s;e for two or three months &s;ilence; and
then declare, as with truth I may, that the e&s;teem and affection which you
have &s;o well de&s;erved of me have never undergone the lea&s;t diminution or
abatement. It is with me a me|lancholy ta&s;k, to <HI>write</HI> letters when I
am not well; although it be the time, of all others, when it is mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary for me to <HI>receive</HI> them.&mdash;Our friend Dod&s;ley, I
pre&s;ume, has &s;ent you a book of his Fables before this time. What merit I
have there, is in the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>; in the <HI>original Fables,</HI>
al|though <PB N="244" REF="269"> I can hardly claim a &s;ingle Fable as my own;
and in the <HI>Index,</HI> which I cau&s;ed to be thrown into the form of
<HI>Morals,</HI> and which are almo&s;t wholly mine. I wi&s;h to God it may
&s;ell; for he has been at great expence about it. The two rivals which he has
to dread, are, the editi|ons of Richard&s;on and of Croxall. The
<HI>Fables</HI> in Croxall are tolerably writen: his <HI>reflections,</HI>
little to the purpo&s;e, either for boys or grown people.&mdash;Richard&s;on's
<HI>Improvement of L'E&s;trange</HI> would be a better collection, both for the
<HI>Fables</HI> and the <HI>moral Reflections,</HI> had he not admitted,
through an extravagant and mi&s;taken love of drollery, that vulgarity of
phra&s;e which in many places is not <HI>common Engli&s;h.</HI> This, I think,
a true &s;tate of the ca&s;e: &s;ay the be&s;t you can in behalf of
Dod&s;ley.&mdash;As to his cuts, though to <HI>him</HI> expen&s;ive, they will
hardly, I fear, meet with much of your approbation.&mdash;the &s;cale is much
too &s;mall&mdash;and the emblematick prints which are larger will &s;carce, I
fear, be under&s;tood.&mdash;I pro|cured a copy from Ba&s;kerville
<HI>before</HI> the plates were <HI>in&s;erted,</HI> and have cau&s;ed my
painter (Alcock) to &s;upply the vacancies with &s;ome devices of my
own&mdash;&s;ome account of which I &s;end you, as it may amu&s;e you for a
minute. I want one or two to compleat my &s;cheme, and &s;hould be glad if you
would propo&s;e &s;ome in your next letter.&mdash;I return you my hearty thanks
for the hints you gave for the Cambridge ver&s;es; but when I received them it
was too late, and I my&s;elf too much indi&s;po&s;ed, either to throw them into
proper form, or even to an&s;wer that gentleman's letter, which I thought a
very gen|teel one.&mdash;I know not what he did on that occa|&s;ion, having
&s;een neither Cambridge nor Oxford ver&s;es&mdash;Mr. Dod&s;ley gave me 
<Q REND="inline">"The Environs of London."&mdash;</Q>Between friends,
I wi&s;h he may find five thou&s;and readers, whom the management of that work
plea&s;es more than <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;I will try to <PB N="245" REF="270"> get
you &s;ome of the <HI>cuts,</HI> if you de&s;ire me to do &s;o, though it will
reflect a kind of tacit di&s;like of the <HI>whole</HI> performance&mdash;His
brother publi&s;hes this winter 
<Q REND="inline">"The Works of Soame Jenyns,"</Q> in three
pocket-volumes; and a Chine&s;e novel from a M&s;. tran&s;lation revi&s;ed,
&amp;c. by a friend of mine. You have perhaps heard me &s;peak of Mr.
Percy&mdash;he <HI>was</HI> in treaty with Mr. James Dod&s;ley, for the
publication of our be&s;t old bal|lads, in three volumes. He has a large folio
M&s;. of ballads, which he &s;hewed me, and which, with his own natural and
acquired talents, would qualify him for the purpo&s;e, as well as any man in
Eng|land. I propo&s;ed the &s;cheme for him <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> wi&s;hing to
&s;ee an elegant <HI>edition</HI> and good col|lection of this kind.&mdash;I
was al&s;o to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in &s;electing and rejecting; and in
fixing upon the be&s;t readings&mdash;But my illne&s;s broke off our
corre&s;pondence, the beginning of winter&mdash;and I know not what he has done
&s;ince.&mdash;There is a New Peerage going to be publi&s;hed&mdash;with, I
believe, the draughts of the Peers hou&s;es&mdash;Lightholer called here, and
&s;aid he had taken Lord Lyttleton's, and Lord Stamford's, for that
purpo&s;e.&mdash;the latter of which he &s;hewed me.&mdash;Thus have I told you
what I hear of new <HI>publi|cations</HI>&mdash;as to what pa&s;&s;es in the
bu&s;y world, I know no more than the Chronicle informs me,&mdash;unle&s;s when
<HI>your</HI> letters happen to be <HI>rounded</HI> with little anecdotes from
Bath.&mdash;Have you &s;een Ba&s;kerville's new Prayer-books?&mdash;My Lord
Dartmouth has undertaken to pre&s;ent two to the King and Prince&s;s.&mdash;Do,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL, upon your la&s;t a&s;&s;urance, take it <HI>ever</HI> for
granted, that you do not omit writing upon any &s;core of ceremony. This will
render your &s;ilence, at lea&s;t in &s;ome <HI>degree,</HI> le&s;s irk&s;ome
to me; when I do not think it the effect of my own procra&s;tination.&mdash;Mr.
Dod&s;ley had &s;old two thou&s;and of his Fables long ago; but complain|ed
that he &s;hould <HI>lo&s;e</HI> thirty pounds by my neighbour Ba&s;kerville's
impre&s;&s;ion; and that he &s;hould not be more than ten pounds gainer upon
the <HI>whole.</HI> I told him it was enough, in books of <HI>this &s;ort,</HI>
if the fir&s;t edition paved the way for their future e&s;tabli&s;hment in
&s;chools. And &s;urely &s;o it is: for a book of this kind, once
e&s;tabli&s;hed, becomes an ab&s;olute e&s;tate for many years; and brings in
at lea&s;t as certain and as regular returns. I would <HI>wi&s;h</HI> him to
give the polite world one more edition from Ba&s;kerville's pre&s;s; admitting
only a <HI>new</HI> &s;ett of emblematical top and tail-pieces; and confining
tho&s;e empty cuts relating to each Fable to the cheap edition which he prints
at London. A &s;econd edition of this latter &s;ort will appear in a little
time; and if you have any improvements to propo&s;e, he will very thankfully
receive them. Mr. Spence offers him to write <HI>the life</HI> afre&s;h; and
Spence, Burke, Lowth, and Melmoth, advi&s;e him to di&s;|card
<HI>Italicks.</HI> I confe&s;s he has u&s;ed them to a very great
<HI>exce&s;s,</HI> but yet I do not think they &s;hould be utterly
di&s;carded.</P>
<P>I did not intend that Mr. Davenport &s;hould ever hear of tho&s;e
ver&s;es; and how he came to do &s;o, is pa&s;t my comprehen&s;ion. He &s;eemed
to <PB N="247" REF="272"> me to have de&s;erted Worfield, without any
in|tention to return again. I therefore meant to in&s;cribe them under my own
Venus, in order to afford &s;ome novelty, at an <HI>ea&s;y rate,</HI> to
tho&s;e who are curious enough to <HI>repeat</HI> their vi&s;its here. Pray, if
you &s;ee Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, pre&s;ent my be&s;t re&s;pects to them; and
as to the ver&s;es, I will &s;end you a copy for them, if you <HI>de&s;ire</HI>
or <HI>advi&s;e</HI> me &s;o to do.&mdash;Mr. S &mdash; is agreeable, not void
of learning, has &s;ome &s;martne&s;s, but little ta&s;te.&mdash;Mrs. S &mdash; has
<HI>much</HI> of the latter; and perhaps imagination, which makes a part of
ta&s;te, may have had no &s;mall &s;hare in converting her to Popery.&mdash;Mr.
Powys I have almo&s;t for|gotten.&mdash;You are ingenious very inventive in
regard to the means of giving your&s;elf mortifi|cation. I dare to &s;ay, your
new building &s;ug|ge&s;ts no &s;uch idea as you conceive.&mdash;And I think it
&s;ufficient in a par&s;onage-hou&s;e, if one &s;ees detached &s;pecimens of
ta&s;te or elegance, without uniformity, or even without con&s;i|&s;tency.</P>
<P>I do not find but that you <HI>figure</HI> among the gentry near
Bath. Dr. Charlton, who was here ye&s;terday with Sir Francis and Mr. Knight,
gave me an account that the B&mdash; of G&mdash; had been to pay his re&s;pects
to you. I will not enter into particulars, but would wi&s;h you to cultivate
his acquaintance.&mdash;I &s;hewed Sir Fran|cis the dead colouring of the
picture which I intend to &s;end to you;&mdash;but you mu&s;t know that Alcock
is the mo&s;t volatile of all creatures that have not wings. By way of
improving the picture I meant for Dod&s;ley, he has made it in|finitely le&s;s
like, and yet it mu&s;t go to London as <HI>it is,</HI> for God knows when he
can be brought to alter it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;owes, 
<DATE>Sept. 14, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have thanked you many weeks ago, for a very <HI>long</HI>
and <HI>entertaining</HI> letter; the <HI>length</HI> of which, as well as the
<HI>entertainment,</HI> was <PB N="249" REF="274"> increa&s;ed by a
Po&s;t&s;cript a few days after.&mdash;But as the Winter is with me a dull and
uniform &s;ea&s;on, &s;o the Summer is a time of univer&s;al di&s;|&s;ipation;
and very happy do I think my&s;elf, when after a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
company, vi&s;its paid, and excur&s;ions taken, I can &s;it down in peace and
quietne&s;s, to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of corre&s;pondence and
friend&s;hip. Either rea&s;on, habit, or complexion tells me, that I am never
<HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> &s;o properly employed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t digre&s;&s;ion I made was to the concert at Worce&s;ter,
to hear The Me&s;&s;iah well per|formed; to meet a number of faces one knows;
but fir&s;t, and principally, to vi&s;it your brother, <HI>without</HI> which
motive I had not gone. In the two <HI>former</HI> re&s;pects, the journey
an&s;wered my expectation:&mdash;but, alas! your brother was gone into
Hereford&s;hire. I, however, alighted out of the chai&s;e; and the
hou&s;e-keeper very civilly &s;hewed me his delightful parlour, that looks
in|to the meadows, the Prebend's gardens, and down the Severn to Malvern-hills.
A more agreeable town-hou&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly be found any where. But I
regretted, when I reached the inn, that I had not a&s;ked to &s;ee his
children; for I either heard them up-&s;tairs, had a glimp&s;e of them at the
window, or fancied, to a degree of conviction, that they were mo&s;t of them
within the hou&s;e. I now return to remark upon &s;ome particulars in your
letter&mdash;I believe it is that indifference you complain of, which is the
<HI>grand</HI> detriment to genius in an advanced part of life. In all
<HI>poetical</HI> affairs, we are too apt to cry out with Pallas, 
<Q REND="inline">"Non e&s;t mihi tibia tanti."</Q> And this renders
all our efforts tame, pro&s;aic, and judicious. But this propen&s;ity, as well
as many others, we &s;hould guard again&s;t, upon the approach of age: change
the object of our a|mu&s;ements; cheri&s;h hopes, well or ill-grounded, 
<PB N="250" REF="275"> of finding that plea&s;ure in the novelty of objects,
which we have not found in any individual. The&s;e are the means of
<HI>pre&s;erving our vivacity</HI> a &s;omewhat longer time than it naturally
la&s;ts; but how far it is <HI>prudent</HI> to attach our&s;elves to the world
that we mu&s;t leave, is a point which <HI>you</HI> better can determine.
Refined ta&s;te, as it im|plies a <HI>love</HI> of phy&s;ical beauty, has this
tendency.</P>
<P>There is nothing can be more rational than what you &s;ay about the
expediency of <HI>lo&s;ing no time,</HI> if I mean to collect and publi&s;h
what I have written. You are indeed very partial to my abilities; but, allowing
for <HI>that,</HI> what you mention <HI>coincides</HI> with what I have thought
my|&s;elf, and this for &s;ome years pa&s;t. A more agreeable kind of
<HI>di&s;traction</HI> in &s;ummer, and an indifferent &s;tate of health and
&s;pirits in winter, have hitherto prevented any progre&s;s in the cor|rection
of my pieces. To the&s;e I might add a <HI>&s;u&s;pence</HI> about the
compo&s;itions, and the manner, proper for publication. I am now mo&s;t
inclin|ed to make a collection of the whole. I mean, the be&s;t of what are
already printed or in M&s;.; to publi&s;h them by &s;ub&s;cription in a large
<HI>quar|to</HI> &s;ize for the &s;ake of profit; and to apologize for this
method, by mentioning the expence of top and tail-pieces, with which I mean
they &s;hall be embelli&s;hed. Some of <HI>the&s;e</HI> (by the bye) may be
taken from my farm, the re&s;t emblema|tical, in an ea&s;y and carele&s;s, but,
at the &s;ame time, elegant manner. I &s;hould think the in|&s;tance of Mr.
Pope might render this method not di&s;reputable; and it might be adverti&s;ed
(as was done by Mr. Spence) that, unle&s;s a certain number were &s;ub&s;cribed
for, the whole affair &s;hould be no farther pro&s;ecuted. This would put it in
the way of many friends to &s;erve me, who (I flatter my&s;elf) <HI>with
inclination,</HI> e&s;teem them&s;elves void of <HI>opportunity.</HI> Let me
beg you <PB N="251" REF="276"> to think &s;eriou&s;ly of this, as well as of a
general title-page, before you write again.</P>
<P>Thank you kindly for all the little diverting anecdotes that are
contained in your letter. I am glad to hear your <HI>place</HI> brings you
company; partly, as it tends to amu&s;e you; and yet more, as it tends to make
your merit more con&s;picuous. You and I have led a life of total
di&s;intere&s;&s;|ment. Let me advi&s;e you to &s;eek &s;ome <HI>advantage</HI>
from your commerce with <HI>great men.</HI>&mdash;The boy, who was here with
you and Mrs. Graves, was here la&s;t Friday evening with a Mr. Jolliffe and his
&s;on; the latter of whom ob&s;erved your name upon the bench, and &s;eemed
proud to de|clare that he was once your &s;chool-fellow. Mr. Stratford (to whom

an oppor|tunity, you will oblige me by pre&s;enting my com|pliments to that

Grub-&s;treet I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>I have made &s;ome little improvements about my place; have taken
away the wall in front, and made a hand&s;ome ring; have extended my path, in
one piece of ground, greatly for the bet|ter&mdash;but the grand water in the
valley will make no figure till next &s;pring.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted my friend Hull the come|dian in
altering the Tragedy of Ro&s;amond; had it brought upon the &s;tage to a full
hou&s;e at Bir|mingham, where it was very well received; put Hull into a way of
making an indirect compli|ment to the pre&s;ent King in the ten la&s;t lines of
his Epilogue, which was followed by 
<Q REND="inline">"God &s;ave great George," &amp;c.</Q> in a full
chorus of the audi|ence and actors drawn out abrea&s;t upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Since this, there has been depo&s;ited in my hands a large
collection of Poetry, by a Mi&s;s Wheatly of Wal&s;all: many of the pieces
writ|ten in an excellent and truly cla&s;&s;ical &s;tyle; &s;im|ple,
&s;entimental, harmonious, and more correct than I almo&s;t ever &s;aw written
by a lady. They will be publi&s;hed, I believe, by &s;ub&s;cription, un|der the
patronage of Lord Dartmouth.</P>
<P>But nothing in the poetical way has plea&s;ed me better than a
compliment which I received <PB N="253" REF="280"> about nine days ago by the
po&s;t, under the feigned name <HI>Cot&s;wouldia.</HI>&mdash;She mu&s;t be
&s;ome Glou&s;ter&s;hire lady that has &s;een the place; as &s;he rai&s;es up a
Fairy in my grove, into who&s;e mouth &s;he puts the compliment. It &s;eems
writ|ten by &s;omebody of fa&s;hion by the &s;tyle.&mdash;Can you form any
conjecture?</P>
<P>There was a Mr. Freeman of Bet&s;tow (or &s;ome &s;uch name) with
two or three ladies in a coach and fix that were here not long before; a very
genteel and polite young man.</P>
<P>I really know not how to &s;top, when I begin a letter to

if by &s;o doing I &s;hould lay you under no <HI>re&s;traint.</HI> It is my
principal ca&s;cade. Its appearance well re&s;em|bles the playfulne&s;s of
infancy; &s;kipping from &s;ide to &s;ide, with a thou&s;and antic motions,
that an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than the mere amu&s;e|ment of the

<Q>Cui enim na&s;centi faciles arri&s;erunt Mu&s;ae, &amp;c.</Q> It
then proceeds a few hundred yards, where it <HI>rolls</HI> and <HI>&s;lits
iron</HI> for manufactures of all kinds; re&s;embling the graver toils of
manhood, either in acquiring money, or furni&s;hing the conveni|encies,
comforts, or ornaments of life: and, in this manner, it proceeds under the name
of The Stour, &s;upplying works for ca&s;ting, forging, and and &s;haping iron,
for every civil or military pur|po&s;e. Perhaps you may not know that my rills
are the principal &s;ources of this river; or that this river &s;upplies
<HI>more</HI> iron-works than almo&s;t any &s;ingle river in the kingdom: for
&s;o my friend Mr. Knight told me.</P>
<P>The Mr. D&mdash; you enquire after, and who wrote the

palace, and &s;ees the King every day. <HI>While</HI> Livie was <HI>with</HI>
him, word came that the King was coming into his room; upon which Livie was
&s;ent out another way.&mdash;The King a&s;ked Dalton, whom he had with
him?&mdash;and was an&s;wered, an editor of Horace, who had in&s;cribed it to
Lord Bute.&mdash;Dalton is to pre&s;ent a copy to the King.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e to you a &s;pecimen of the decorated parts of Horace,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO I really owe you an apology? you who are embarra&s;&s;ed with
&s;uch a number of momentous concerns, as hardly allow a fair trial to letters
of mere amu&s;ement? Alas! I cannot &s;helter my long &s;ilence under a
&s;uppo&s;i|tion of this kind. I believe, I even <HI>hope,</HI> that you have
di&s;approved my long neglect; as I can very faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, I have
repeatedly done, <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> There are certain times and &s;ea|&s;ons
when I have not either the <HI>power</HI> or the <HI>will</HI> to write; as
Hannibal &s;aid about attacking Rome, 
<Q REND="inline">"quandoque memtem non dari, quan|doque
pote&s;talem."</Q> This being an intellec|tual kind of <HI>lethargy,</HI> it
would have been at lea&s;t a friendly office, if you had <HI>rouzed</HI> me, as
you <HI>might</HI> have done, by a &s;upernumerary let|ter. I never receive a
line from you, but I feel an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to an&s;wer
it that very in&s;tant. Impediments &s;ometimes occur; and, that in&s;tant
being neglected, matter is accumulated for a longer letter than I am always
re&s;olute enough to undertake: at the &s;ame time, I can never content
my&s;elf with uttering one half of what I have to &s;ay.&mdash;Pray 
<PB N="258" REF="285"> is not that <HI>good &s;ort of man,</HI> to whom you
allude, a Mr. K&mdash;? Let him be ever &s;o good a &s;ort of man in the common
e&s;timation, I dare aver him to be neither an ingenious per&s;on nor a candid
critic. There may be fifty or more preferable readings to what are received in
this new Ho|race: yet he will find a better <HI>text</HI> there <HI>upon the
whole,</HI> than in any one edition before ex|tant. As to the <HI>beauty</HI>
of <HI>type</HI> and <HI>pre&s;s-work,</HI> it is too obvious to need
vindication. The accu|racy of the <HI>latter</HI> almo&s;t exceeds what was
ever found in any other book. Then as to the <HI>fron|ti&s;piece,</HI> it is, I
think, much &s;uperior to &s;uch as <HI>ordinarily</HI> occur; the
<HI>&s;ubject</HI> animated, and well cho&s;en; and the <HI>execution</HI> very
commendable: at lea&s;t, if we allow for the <HI>nice</HI> touches which it
required, and the <HI>uncommon difficulty</HI> of getting any thing of this
kind done to one's direction.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer; not always accurate in
his determinations, and much le&s;s &s;o in his language: too often led away,
by a de&s;ire of routing prejudices and de|&s;troying giants. And yet there is
no province wherein he appears to more advantage, in <HI>gene|ral,</HI> than in
throwing new light upon Characters in Briti&s;h Hi&s;tory. I wi&s;h he would
compo&s;e a regular work, making this his principal point. He has, with great
labour, in his Book of Pain|ters, recorded matter of little importance,
re|lative to people that were of le&s;s. I have a right to be &s;evere, for his
volumes co&s;t me above thirty &s;hillings; yet, where he drops the
<HI>anti|quarian</HI> in them, his remarks are &s;triking, and worth
peru&s;al.&mdash;I have &s;ent for 
<Q REND="inline">"Ge&s;ner's Rural Poems,"</Q> and intend to &s;ee 
<Q REND="inline">"The Death of Abel;"</Q> though I expect to find
&s;mall plea|&s;ure in this <HI>poetical pro&s;e,</HI> unle&s;s exqui&s;itely
well tuned.&mdash;Thank you for the anecdote of Lord Courtney: a thou&s;and
&s;uch &s;ort of things, that <PB N="259" REF="286"> engage the public
attention, are never capable of penetrating the depth of my retirement.</P>
<P>Mr. Melmoth you will probably &s;ee often, as he intends to make
Bath his place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Omphale</HI> you &s;ent me is a mo&s;t excellent figure, and
I &s;hall wi&s;h much to get a good ca&s;t of it; at lea&s;t, when I am able to
afford it.&mdash;When I write again, I will give you the be&s;t account I can
of <HI>my &s;hare</HI> in Dod&s;ley's new Fables; though it will be no ea&s;y
matter to &s;peak <HI>&s;eparately</HI> of it, with any preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now, I think, I have &s;poke to mo&s;t of the articles in your
la&s;t letter.&mdash;Mr. Dod&s;ley, who &s;ays he vi&s;ited you, would acquaint
you how we divided our time whil&s;t he was here, into two <HI>principal</HI>
parts, 
<Q REND="inline">"l'un &agrave; dormir, l'autre &agrave; ne rien
faire."</Q> Yet we paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company; of which
this &s;ea&s;on has afforded me at <HI>lea&s;t</HI> an equal &s;hare with any
that went before. I will particularize a few; opening the li&s;t with no le&s;s

for Worce&s;ter&mdash;Earl of Bath with Dr. Mon&s;on, Mrs. Montague (who wrote

if the <HI>beauty</HI> of her <HI>per&s;on</HI> did not impo&s;e upon my
judgement. There are many others whom I would di&s;tingui&s;h, if my time or
paper would permit.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e that you and Mr. Dod&s;ley would be
mighty unanimous with regard to the propriety of &s;etting my &s;ub&s;cription
on foot&mdash;I do not di&s;pute any of your arguments&mdash;they tally exactly
with my own opinion; at lea&s;t, al|lowing for the higher idea you have of my

publication too long <HI>already,</HI>&mdash;till many of the compo&s;itions
will not ap|pear to the &s;ame advantage as before: and till I have not half
the power that I had formerly, to improve them. When I am low-&s;pirited, I
almo&s;t &s;hudder at this tremendous contract <PB N="261" REF="288"> with the
publick; when my &s;pirits are elevated, I &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity that you do,

<HI>know</HI> this, that <HI>if</HI> I print at <HI>all,</HI> the
&s;ub&s;cription is by no means to be neglected this pre&s;ent winter.&mdash;I
have &s;een our friend Dr. Charlton many times this &s;ea&s;on; at The
Lea&s;owes; at Mr. Knight's; at his own hou&s;e; and at my Lord Foley's. This
vi&s;it to my Lord Foley's was performed about three weeks ago. I went with
young Knight; and the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charlton took off
all re&s;traint, and made the vi&s;it perfectly agreeable. My Lord's behaviour
was entirely free and ho&s;pitable; and his conver&s;ation lively and
entertaining&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s, far beyond the idea which I have been
taught to conceive of him.&mdash;His table, the mo&s;t magnificent, I believe,

<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very obliging and humorous Poem
which you are &s;o kind to &s;end me. I really think it very ingenious, and,
upon the whole, ex|tremely correct; although I have taken the li|berty of

reli&s;h the beauties of this Poem. I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own

to &s;hew it to the publick in the mo&s;t advantageous manner. It certainly

may come a day, when I &s;hall find occa&s;ion to expre&s;s my gratitude. The
pictures you &s;ent arrived &s;afe on Thur&s;day; and have been &s;ince
cleaned, and put up in their places. I can|not enter upon this &s;ubject now;
finding it almo&s;t &s;ix o'clock at night, and having ju&s;t received a letter
from Mr. Dod&s;ley, which he requires me to an&s;wer by return of po&s;t. It
relates to the <HI>&s;cheme</HI> mentioned in his la&s;t, which is intended for
my emolument; but which I mu&s;t not expect to &s;ucceed, without
con&s;iderable mortification. This <HI>inter nos.</HI>&mdash;You mu&s;t by no

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. G&mdash; tells me, that you have done me the honour to lay
&s;ome &s;tre&s;s upon re|ceiving a letter from me. Alas! it mu&s;t be owing
purely to your benevolence, which makes you wi&s;h to hear of an ab&s;ent
friend, and not to any expectations you can rea&s;onably form of entertainment
from his pen. The long letter with which you favoured me was &s;o very lively
as well as ingenious, that I de&s;paired of draw|ing from my fountains the
vivacity you do from the Bath-waters. But, be this as it will, the vein of
friend&s;hip that runs through your letter demands my ample&s;t
acknowledgements; and if you will accept of <HI>&s;uch</HI> returns, I
pro|mi&s;e they will be as <HI>hearty</HI> as they are <HI>in&s;ipid.</HI></P>
<P>I agree with you, that the fir&s;t &s;allies of ima|gination will
generally prove the mo&s;t &s;prightly; <PB N="265" REF="292"> and that they
will often comprehend the prin|cipal features of a &s;ubject. They are of the
nature of dead-colouring in a portrait; which one &s;ometimes thinks more

painter will not <HI>hurt</HI> a portrait by the &s;ub|&s;equent labour he
be&s;tows upon it, nor will a <HI>good</HI> writer injure his piece by the
pains he takes to round and perfect it. It mu&s;t be &s;ome de|fect in the
ta&s;te of either that makes his dili|gence detrimental, or gives occa&s;ion

<Q REND="inline">"Manum de tabula."</Q> I be|lieve it will appear
upon examination, that works which co&s;t mo&s;t labour have generally been
thought the <HI>ea&s;ie&s;t,</HI> and plea&s;ed the <HI>longe&s;t.</HI> One
cannot, however, deny that there is a &s;ort of per&s;ons formed by nature for
<HI>&s;hooting flying,</HI> (which, by the way, I could never <HI>do</HI>) and
that their &s;allies of imagination are what they can hardly improve by any
future pains. The&s;e may be called men of wit and fire, but it is the union of
<HI>ta&s;te</HI> with the&s;e that con&s;titutes fine writing. True ta&s;te
will never &s;tiffen or overcharge any performance: it will rather be employed
to &s;mooth, &s;implify, and give that ea&s;e on which <HI>grace</HI> depends.
One can as little deny that there are <HI>kinds</HI> of writing which have a
better chance than others to &s;ucceed without much labour, which &s;tart forth
mature at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as Pallas did from the brain of Jupiter. Works of
<HI>humour</HI> are often of this &s;ort; and there are many in&s;tances in
Butler's Hudibras. Yet I think the humour of <HI>Swift</HI> was greatly owing
to a judicious <HI>revi&s;al.</HI> Pardon me, my dear friend, for this tedious
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which you little thought of bringing upon your&s;elf by the
obliging hint you gave concerning tho&s;e ver&s;es upon Venus. I do acknowledge
that an additional &s;tanza there, containing a reflexion on Chine&s;e
architecture, were better laid a&s;ide. <PB N="266" REF="293"> It &s;eemed to
me one of the 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;plendi da pec|cata,"</Q> that might be a little
<HI>popular</HI> at this <HI>time</HI>; and has, therefore, for this
&s;ea&s;on, ap|peared on a board by the &s;ide of the Venus. We, who cannot
erect fre&s;h temples, or even add a new garden-&s;eat every &s;pring, are
obliged to make the mo&s;t we can of a new and toler|able copy of ver&s;es,
that co&s;ts us <HI>thought</HI> in|&s;tead of <HI>money</HI>; and even at a
pinch to piece out a dull &s;cene with duller poetry: how el&s;e could I keep
my place in countenance, &s;o near the pompous piles of Hagley? And yet there
are few <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> vi&s;itants that do not &s;hew an
<HI>affection</HI> for the little Amoret, as much as they admire the &s;tately
Sachari&s;&s;a&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"plerumque gratae <HI>divitibus vices.</HI>"</Q> I
have often con&s;idered why tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of palaces yet e&s;teem a
root-hou&s;e or a cottage as a de&s;irable object in their gardens.&mdash;Is it
not from having experi|enced the imperfection of happine&s;s in higher life,
that they are led to <HI>conceive</HI> it more com|pleat beneath a roof of
&s;traw, where, perhaps, it may really be as defective as in the apart|ments of
a King or a Mini&s;ter?&mdash;A thou&s;and thanks to you and Mrs. Davenport for
the ac|commodations you &s;o kindly offer me. Expe|rience will no more &s;uffer
me to que&s;tion the <HI>cordiality</HI> than the politene&s;s of your
reception. What an amu&s;ing picture have you given of Bath! plea&s;ures
carried to the utmo&s;t height, and opiates ready when one is cloyed with
plea&s;ures! And yet, let me confe&s;s a truth, you have <HI>lightly</HI>
touched upon tho&s;e <HI>very</HI> articles, which would prove to me the mo&s;t
<HI>&s;pecifically</HI> plea&s;ing. For can any temptation be &s;tronger, than
to &s;ay that <HI>you</HI> re&s;ide there? and does not my friend G&mdash; re&s;ide
at Claverton, of who&s;e genius and friend&s;hip I have had proofs
the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t? and have you not Mr. Webb, and now Mr. Melmoth, to
make Bath <HI>enviable</HI> <PB N="267" REF="294"> for the re&s;idence of
literature? What a joy would it afford me to go on a party with you to
Percefield, whither Mr. and Mrs. Morrice gave me the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
invitations!&mdash;The&s;e &s;urely are plea&s;ures of which&mdash;I
<HI>hope</HI> one day to partake.</P>
<P>My health, generally bad in winter and &s;pring, has hitherto been
tolerable. The <HI>in|fluenza</HI> of la&s;t &s;pring continued to depre&s;s me
half the &s;ummer. Would you think the ver&s;es I inclo&s;ed were written on
that occa&s;ion by a young journeyman &s;hoemaker; and one that lives at the
village of Rowley, near me? He con&s;idered my di&s;order in &s;omewhat too
<HI>grave</HI> a light, as I did not think my life endangered by it; but,
allowing for this, and the <HI>partiality</HI> he &s;hews <HI>me,</HI> you will
think the lines pretty extra|ordinary for one of <HI>his occupation.</HI> They
are not, however, the <HI>only,</HI> or, perhaps, the <HI>chief</HI>
&s;pecimens of his genius; and yet, before he came to me, his principal
knowledge was drawn from <HI>Magazines.</HI> For the&s;e two or three years
pa&s;t, I have lent him Cla&s;&s;ics, and other books in Engli&s;h. You &s;ee,
to <HI>him,</HI> I am a great Mae|cenas; although you and my friend expect me
to become an author by &s;ub&s;cription.&mdash;On this head I will &s;ay no
more at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> than that I am infinitely obliged by your extreme
friendly offers. My friend G&mdash;, who knows my &s;en|timents, has
&s;ometimes the honour of waiting on you; I ought not, therefore, after this
tedi|ous epi&s;tle, to begin to trouble you with a written explanation of them.

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Lea&s;owes. 
<DATE>Jan. 4, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t letter mu&s;t have been confu&s;ed, and the arrival of it,
I fear, uncertain.</P>
<P>The hare and birds in one of the pictures which you &s;ent me, I
think, are well. The other parts of it indifferent. They grey hound wor&s;t of
all. The portrait is by no means equal to its companion, either in beauty of
the per&s;on, or &s;kill of the painter; yet it matches &s;o well with the
other, that I find my parlour very much em|belli&s;hed by it. Pardon the
freedom with which I critici&s;e your pre&s;ent; and accept once more my very
thankful acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I am truly glad to find &s;o worthy a Nobleman, and &s;o warm a
friend of yours, as my Lord Willoughby is, made a Lord of the Bed-cham|ber.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing &s;ince I wrote la&s;t in re|gard to
<HI>my</HI> affair; though I expect to do &s;o every day. I have &s;uch a tribe
of humours and pecu|liarities, that it is ea&s;ier to make me rich than to make
me happy; and ten to one that the favour will not be conferred without
di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ome of the&s;e &s;aid humours, &amp;c. However, one mu&s;t
make the be&s;t of it; and reflect, that mortifica|tions in one place may
preclude mortifications in another.</P>
<P>I go to-morrow, by appointment, to Enville; where I may probably
&s;tay till Saturday. I have wi&s;hed mo&s;t heartily for a copy of your Fable
to take with me; but Dod&s;ley has not yet returned that I &s;ent him. Pray
con&s;ider my propo&s;ed al|terations rather as hints than real improvements,
and let me have a copy as &s;oon you can. I wrote my critici&s;m over twice,
and know not whether I &s;ent the be&s;t or the wor&s;t copy; &s;o I &s;end the
<PB N="269" REF="296"> other, though perhaps much the &s;ame. I forgot to
particularize many &s;hining parts in your little Fable, that are either
elegant or humourous: of the former &s;ort, nothing could be happier than what
you &s;ay about H&mdash;: as it touches, in the <HI>gentle&s;t</HI> manner, on
a po&s;&s;ible truth, which, if expre&s;&s;ed rather than implied, might not be
al|together inoffen&s;ive. This beauty is produced by &s;ub&s;tituting H&mdash; in&s;tead
of L&mdash;, the place in|&s;tead of the proprietor.</P>
<P>I have lately read 
<Q REND="inline">"The Death of Abel."&mdash;</Q>It is not void of
merit; but might have been made much more pathetic by a more &s;imple and
pro&s;aic &s;tyle.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire my be&s;t re&s;pects to Mrs. Jago and your
family.&mdash;May not I &s;ee you here this Chri&s;tmas? as I wi&s;h to do,
becau&s;e it is the &s;ea&s;on pre&s;ent; and not that I am not at all times
and at all &s;ea|&s;ons mo&s;t un&s;eignedly glad to wait upon you, and mo&s;t
affectionately your ever faithful &s;er|vant: 
<Q> 
<L>Tecum etenim longos memini con&s;umere &s;oles,</L> 
<L>Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes.</L> 
<L>Unum opus, &amp; requiem pariter di&s;ponimus ambo,

<SALUTE>My good friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;u&s;picious that my letters (of which I have &s;ent two) do
not reach you by the way <PB N="270" REF="297"> of Warwick. This is meant as an
experiment whether they will arrive by way of Southam. It is meant withall to
remind you of perfecting your little Fable, and di&s;patching it to me as
&s;oon as may be. I would fain tran&s;mit a copy to Lord S&mdash;'s, before the
family &s;eparates, or leaves Enville; by whom, I am &s;ure, it would be
admired.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it which I made there, and four or
five days pa&s;&s;ed very happily. At coming away, I &s;hewed my Lord two or
three of Mr. D&mdash;'s la&s;t letters, which laid open to him the &s;cheme
that was carrying on for me. I reque&s;ted al&s;o, if there &s;hould be
occa&s;ion (which there po&s;&s;ibly might <HI>not</HI>) that he would allow me
the honour of being known to him. He &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"he was glad to find what was going forward; and had
long wi&s;hed to &s;ee &s;omething of that &s;ort begun before: that he
&s;hould be in town, I think, in February; and would do me any &s;ervice in his
power. He de&s;ired me al&s;o to acquaint Mr. D&mdash; (in allu&s;ion to the
latter's uncertainty about my Lord's political connexi|ons) that he thought it
the duty of every hone&s;t man to &s;upport the pre&s;ent Government; and that
he &s;hould continue his regard for the Mini|&s;ter &s;o long as he &s;aw
nothing in his mea&s;ures that was prejudicial to his Country."</Q></P>
<P>I know that you will take a friendly part in any good that may
befall me. Pray write, be it ever &s;o carele&s;sly; and believe me ever yours,
and Mrs. Jago's mo&s;t affectionate and faithful.</P>

<P> The writer &s;urvived the date of this letter but a &s;hort time,
his death happening on the eleventh of the following month, to the
