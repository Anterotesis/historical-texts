Period of one hundred and thirty years.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Progre&s;s of AMIR TIMUR, or TAMERLANE, in
Hindo&s;tan.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Higerah 800.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerlane invades Hindo&s;tan.</NOTE>AMIR TIMUR, being informed of
the commotions and civil wars of Hindo&s;tan, began his expedition into that
country, in the eight hundredth year of the Higerah, and, on the twelfth of
Mohirrim, in the following year, arrived on the banks of the Chule Jallali<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A river on the frontiers of Hindo&s;tan.</NOTE>. He
immediately di&s;patched Amir Shech Noor ul Dien to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Shab ul
Dien Mubarick, who had, in charge, the defence of the frontier di&s;tricts.
When Shech Noor <PB N="2" REF="7"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>ul Dien had arrived
within a few miles of Shab ul Dien Mubarick, he &s;ummoned him to &s;ubmit to
Timur. But as the imperial general had previou&s;ly retreated into a &s;trong
hold, on the bank of the river, round which he had drawn a ditch, forming the
place into an i&s;land, he determined to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Shech Noor ul Dien, however, found means, upon making his
approaches, to fill up the ditch: but at night he &s;uffered a con&s;i|derable
lo&s;s, by a violent &s;ally of the be&s;ieged; whom, in the end, he
repul&s;ed, and forced to take &s;helter within their walls. Amir Timur
him&s;elf advanced again&s;t the enemy, with his whole army. Shab ul Dien
intimidated, by the approach of Timur, &s;towed pri|vately, in forty boats, his
trea&s;ure and family, and fell down the river, being two days pur&s;ued in
vain, by Shech Noor ul Dien, who was detached with a party after him. The
garri&s;on, after the departure of their leader, immediately &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>Amir Timur proceeded down the river to the conflux of the Jimboo
and Chinab, where there was a &s;trong fort and town, known by the name of
Tulmubini. He ordered a bridge to be laid acro&s;s, by which his army might
pa&s;s. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerlane lays Tulmu|bini under
contribution.</NOTE>Having pitched his camp, without the town, he laid it under
a heavy contribution. But whil&s;t the inhabitants were very bu&s;y in
collecting the &s;um demanded, a complaint being made in the camp, of the
&s;carcity of provi&s;ions, orders were i&s;&s;ued to &s;eize grain wherever it
&s;hould be found. The &s;oldiers, upon this, ha&s;tened to &s;earch the town,
but not being content to take provi&s;ions alone, the natural con|&s;equence
was, that a general plunder en&s;ued. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabi|tants ma&s;&s;a|cred.</NOTE>The
inhabitants, endeavouring to oppo&s;e this outrage, were ma&s;&s;acred without
mercy.</P>
<P>To be&s;iege the citadel would but retard the de&s;igns of Timur.
He therefore marched, the next day after the ma&s;&s;acre, to a town called
Shawnawaze, where he found more grain than was &s;uffi|cient <PB N="3" REF="8">

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>to &s;erve his whole
army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shawnawaze pillaged.</NOTE>He therefore ordered,
that what could not be carried away &s;hould be burnt; having previou&s;ly cut
off Ji&s;&s;erit, the brother of Shuha Giker, who had attempted to defend the
place with two thou&s;and men. Timur marched, on the third day, from
Shawnawaze, and, cro&s;&s;ing the Bea, came into a rich and plentiful
country.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the
proceedings of Mirza Pier Mahummud, after his having, as has been already
mentioned, taken Moultan. The Sol&s;titial rains hav|ing de&s;troyed a great
part of his cavalry, in the field, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing
his army into the city of Moultan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza Pier Mahummud blockaded in
Moultan.</NOTE>There he was driven to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s by the
inhabitants of the country, who had clo&s;ely inve&s;ted him. His cavalry,
in&s;tead of being able to act again&s;t them, dimini&s;hed daily in their
numbers, for want of forage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is relieved by Timur.</NOTE>In this untoward
&s;ituation were the affairs of that prince, when his grandfather, Amir Timur,
entered Hindo&s;tan, who immediately reinforced Mahummud with a detachment of
thirty thou&s;and cho&s;en hor&s;e, and &s;oon joined him with his whole army.
The prince carried in his mind great animo&s;ity again&s;t the governor of
Bat|tenize, who had chiefly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him. Amir Timur him&s;elf, to
cha&s;ti&s;e the governor, &s;elected ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, with which he
marched directly towards him. When he reached Adjodin, he was &s;hewn the tomb
of Shech Ferid Shuckergunge, the poet, in re&s;pect to who&s;e memory he
&s;pared the few inhabitants who remained in the place, the greater part having
fled to Delhi and Battenize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at Battenize.</NOTE>Timur
continued then his march to Battenize, cro&s;&s;ing the river of Adjodin, and
encamping at Chali&s;kole, from which place, in one day, he marched fifty
crores to Battenize. Upon his arrival, the people of Debalpoor, and other
adjacent towns, crowded into <PB N="4" REF="9"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>the place, in &s;uch
numbers, that half of them were driven out, and obliged to take &s;helter under
the walls. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and inve&s;ts it.</NOTE>They were there
attacked, the fir&s;t day, by the king, and &s;ome thou&s;ands of them &s;lain.
Raw Chillige, who was governor of the place, &s;eeing the enemy &s;o few in
number, drew out the garri&s;on, and formed them without the town, in order of
battle. The Moguls, how|ever, upon the fir&s;t on&s;et, drove him back within
his walls, while the king him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon the enemy's
rear, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the gates before they could be
&s;hut. Then driving the runaways from &s;treet to &s;treet, he became, in a
few hours, intirely ma&s;ter of the place, except the citadel; to reduce which,
he ordered a party immediately to di&s;mount, and begin to undermine it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The city taken.</NOTE>The garri&s;on de&s;ired
to capitulate, to which Timur agreed; and the governor, having had an interview
with the king, pre&s;ented him with three hundred Arabian hor&s;es, and with
many of the va|luable curio&s;ities of Hindo&s;tan. Timur, in return, honoured
him with a chelat; and after the conditions were &s;ettled, &s;ent Amir
So|liman, Sheh, and Omar Ulla, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gates,
com|manding them to &s;lay all tho&s;e who had taken refuge in the place, and
had before been active again&s;t his grand&s;on Mirza Pier Mahum|mud. The
re&s;t, after being plundered, were ordered to be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and the inha|bitants put to the
&s;word.</NOTE>In con&s;equence of this inhuman order, five hundred per&s;ons,
in a few minutes, were put to death. Tho&s;e who remained &s;till within the
&s;ort, were &s;o &s;truck with this ma&s;&s;acre, that they &s;et fire to the
place, murdered their wives and children, and, in mere de&s;pair, &s;ought
after nothing but revenge and death. The &s;cene now became terrible indeed!
but the unfortunate inhabitants were, in the end, cut off to a man; they
however revenged them&s;elves amply, upon the rapacious and inhuman authors of
their di&s;tre&s;s; &s;ome thou|&s;ands <PB N="5" REF="10"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>of the Moguls,
having fallen by their hands. This &s;o much exa&s;perated Amir Timur, that
firebrand of the world, that he or|dered every &s;oul in Battenize to be
ma&s;&s;acred, and to reduce the city it&s;elf to a&s;hes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several cities taken by Ti|mur, and the
inhabitants ma&s;&s;acred.</NOTE>Timur, marching to Suru&s;ti, put the
inhabitants of that place, al&s;o, to the &s;word, and gave the town up to
pillage. Advancing to Fatteabad, he continued the &s;ame &s;cene of barbarity,
through that, and the adjacent towns of Rahib, Amirani, and Jonah. He de|tached
Hak&icirc;m Agher&acirc;ck towards Sammana, with five thou&s;and hor&s;e, and
with the few that remained, he him&s;elf &s;coured the country, and cut off a
tribe of banditti called Jits, who had lived for &s;ome years by rapine. His
army, in the mean time, being di|vided under different chiefs, carried fire and
&s;word through all the provinces of Moultan and Lahore, but when they
advanced, near the capital, he ordered a general rendezvous at Keitil, a town
with|in five crores of Sammana.</P>
<P>Timur him&s;elf &s;oon joined his army, and having regulated the
order of his march, advanced towards Delhi. When he reached Panniput, he
ordered his &s;oldiers to put on their fighting apparel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coats &s;tuffed thick with cotton, worn in&s;tead of
armour.</NOTE>; and, that he might be the better &s;upplied with forage,
cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna, took the fort of Lowni by a&s;&s;ault, and put the
garri&s;on to the &s;word. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives be|fore Delhi,</NOTE>He then marched
down along the river, and encamped oppo&s;ite to the citadel of Delhi,
po&s;ting guards to prevent all com|munication. He immediately detached Amir
Soliman Shaw, and Amir Jehan Shaw, to &s;cour the country behind him to the
&s;outh and &s;outh ea&s;t of the city; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he re|connoitres.</NOTE>whil&s;t he
him&s;elf that very day, with &s;even hundred hor&s;e only, cro&s;&s;ed the
river to reconnoitre the citadel.</P>
<P>Mahmood Shaw and Mullu Eckbal Chan, &s;eeing &s;o few in the
retinue of Timur, i&s;&s;ued forth with five thou&s;and foot and twenty-&s;even
<PB N="6" REF="11"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>elephants again&s;t
him. Mahummud Sillif, an Omrah of repute in Delhi, who led on the attack, was
repul&s;ed and taken pri&s;oner by the Moguls. Timur ordered him to be
immediately beheaded, and after having made the ob&s;ervations which he
de&s;ign|ed, repa&s;&s;ed the river and joined his army.</P>
<P>He next morning moved his camp more to the ea&s;tward, where he
was told, by the princes and generals of his army, that there were then above
one hundred thou&s;and pri&s;oners in his camp, who had been taken &s;ince he
cro&s;&s;ed the Sind; that the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons had, the day before,
expre&s;&s;ed great joy, when they &s;aw him attacked before the citadel; which
rendered it extremely pro|bable, that, on a day of battle, they would join with
their country|men again&s;t him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He ma&s;&s;acres 100,000 pri|&s;oners in cold
blood.</NOTE>The inhuman Timur, who might have found other means of prevention,
gave orders to put all above the age of fifteen to the &s;word, &s;o that, upon
that horrid day, one hundred thou&s;and men were ma&s;&s;acred, in cold blood.
This barbarity, to|gether with his other actions of equal cruelty, gained him
the name of Hill&acirc;k Chan, or the de&s;troying Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;&s;es the Jumna,</NOTE>Upon the fifth of
Jemmad ul Awil, Timur forded the river with his army without oppo&s;ition, and
encamped on the plains of Firo|&s;eabad; where he entrenched him&s;elf, filling
the ditch with buffa|loes fronting the enemy, whom he fa&s;tened with ropes and
picquets to their &s;tations, placing, at the &s;ame time, &s;trong guards, at
proper di&s;tances, behind them.</P>
<P>Though the a&s;trologers pronounced the &s;eventh an unlucky day,
the king marched out of his lines, and drew up his army in order of battle.
Sultan Mamood and Mullu Eckbal Chan, with the ar|my of Delhi, and one hundred
and twenty elephants in mail, ad|vanced towards him. But upon the very fir&s;t
charge of a &s;qua|dron, called the Heroes of Chighitta, the elephant-drivers
were di&s;|mounted, <PB N="7" REF="12"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>and the outrageous
animals, deprived of their guides, ran roaring back, and &s;pread terror and
confu&s;ion among their own ranks. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">totally de|feats the enemy.</NOTE>The veteran
troops of Timur, who had already conquered half the world, improved this
advantage, and the degenerate Hin|doos were, in a few minutes, totally routed,
without making one brave effort for their country, lives, and fortunes. The
conqueror pur&s;ued them, with great &s;laughter, to the very gates of Delhi,
near which he fixed his quarters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who de&s;ert the city.</NOTE>The
con&s;ternation of the fugitives was &s;o great, that, not tru&s;t|ing to their
walls, Sultan Mamood and Mullu Eckbal Chan, de|&s;erted, in the night, their
capital; the former flying to Guzerat, the latter taking the route of Berren.
Timur, having intelligence of their flight, detached parties after them, one of
which coming up with Sultan Mamood, killed a great number of his retinue, and
took his two infant &s;ons, Seif ul Dien and Choda Daad, pri&s;oners. Timur
received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the great men of the city, who crowded to
his camp, and were promi&s;ed protection upon paying great contributions; and,
upon the Friday following, he ordered the Chutba in all the mo&s;ques, to be
read in his own name. Upon the &s;ixteenth of the &s;ame month he placed guards
at the gates, and appointed the &s;criviners of the city, and magi&s;trates, to
regulate the contribution according to the wealth and rank of the inhabitants.
Information was, in the mean time, lodged, that &s;everal omrahs and rich men
had &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, with their de|pendents, and
refu&s;ed to pay down their &s;hare of the ran&s;om. This obliged Timur Shaw to
&s;end troops into the city, to enforce the au|thority of the magi&s;trates. A
general confu&s;ion, uproar, and plun|dering, immediately en&s;ued, which could
not be re&s;trained by the Mogul officers, who, at the &s;ame time, dur&s;t not
acquaint the king that their authority was contemned by the troops.</P>
<P> <PB N="8" REF="13"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>Timur was then
bu&s;y in his camp, in celebrating a grand fe&s;tival, on account of his
victory, &s;o that it was five days before he received any intelligence of
the&s;e proceedings. The fir&s;t notice he had of them, was by the flames of
the city; for the Hindoos, according to their manner, &s;eeing their wives and
daughters ravi&s;hed and pol|luted, their wealth &s;eized by the hand of
rapine, and they them|&s;elves in&s;ulted, beat, and abu&s;ed, at length, by
one con&s;ent, &s;hut the city gates, &s;et fire to their hou&s;es, murthered
their wives and children, and ran out like madmen again&s;t their enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general ma&s;&s;acre.</NOTE>But little effect
had the de&s;pair of the unfortunate upon the Mo|guls, who &s;oon collected
them&s;elves, and began a general ma&s;&s;acre. Some &s;treets were rendered
impa&s;&s;able, by the heaps of dead; and, in the mean time, the gates being
forced, the whole Mogul army were admitted. Then followed a &s;cene of horror,
much ea&s;ier to be imagined than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The unparal|leled misfor|tunes of the
Delhians.</NOTE>The de&s;perate courage of the unfortunate Delhians, was at
length cooled in their own blood. They threw down their weapons, they
&s;ubmitted them&s;elves like &s;heep to the &s;laughter. They permitted one
man to drive a hundred of them pri&s;oners before him; &s;o that we may plainly
perceive, that cowardice is the mother of de&s;pair. In the city the Hindoos
were, at lea&s;t, ten to one, &s;uperior in num|ber to the enemy, and had they
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ouls, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the Moguls,
who were &s;cattered about in every &s;treet, hou&s;e, and corner, laden with
plunder, to have re&s;i&s;ted the dreadful a&s;&s;ault. But though the Hindoos
had the &s;avage re&s;olution of im|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing their hands in the blood of their wives and children, we find
them &s;till the &s;laves of fear, and &s;hrinking at the approach of that
death, which they could &s;o readily execute upon others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam ul Dien ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nt of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in Delhi.</NOTE>This ma&s;&s;acre is, in the Hi&s;tory of Nizam ul

upon the part <PB N="9" REF="14"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>of Timur, having
u&s;ed great violence, by torture and other means, to extort money, the
citizens fell upon them, and killed &s;ome of the Moguls. This circum&s;tance
being reported to the Mogul king, he ordered a general pillage, and, upon
re&s;i&s;tance, a ma&s;&s;acre to com|mence. This account carries greater
appearance of truth along with it, both from Timur's general character of
cruelty, and the improbability of his being five days clo&s;e to the city
without having intelligence of what pa&s;&s;ed within the walls.</P>
<P>But the race of the Mogul prince take, to this day, great pains to

principal one is this, that, in con&s;equence of a general plunder, the king

Afghan, of the tribe of Lodi, which people, forming them&s;elves into a
commercial &s;ociety, carried on a trade between Per&s;ia and Hindo&s;tan. In
the time of Sultan Firo&s;e Shaw, Malleck Ibrahim, the grandfather of Beloli,
being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth, made his way at the court of Delhi, and

received the command of all his Afghan troops. In the action which Chizer Chan
had with Eckbal Chan, Sultan Shech had the good fortune to kill Eckbal, by
which means he became a great favorite with Chizer Chan. He was accordingly
appointed by that prince governor of Sirhind, with the title of I&s;lam Chan,
while his brothers partook of his fortune. One of whom, Malleck Calla, the
father of Sultan Beloli, had a di&s;trict be&s;towed upon him by his

according to his promi&s;e, waited upon the king, that he might be better able
to carry on his intrigues at court. He managed his affairs at Delhi &s;o well,
that he got the government of Sirhind, and other di&s;tricts near it, confirmed

<P>Hamid Chan a&s;ked them the rea&s;on of that extraordinary

their &s;eats upon the carpet, one of them began to prai&s;e the flowers, and
brightne&s;s of the colours, &s;aying, He would be extremely glad to have
&s;uch a carpet, to &s;end home to his own country, to make caps for his boys.
Hamid Chan laughed, and told him, he would give him velvet or brocade for that

from Shum&s;h Chatoon, the &s;i&s;ter of Cuttub Chan, conjuring him, in the

prevailed upon Beloli to break up the peace he had ju&s;t con|cluded, and to
march towards Jionpoor. Mahummud Shaw met him near Sir&s;utti. The younger
brother of Mahummud Shaw, Ha&s;|&s;en Chan, fearing his brother's re&s;entment

<P>Much about this time, the mother of Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein, Bibi Raja,

this manner:&mdash;Beloli is one of your dependants, and cannot think of
contending long with you. If I do not put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Delhi,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli's per|fidy.</NOTE>But Sultan Beloli, in a

upon his march, killing a great number, and taking forty omrahs pri&s;oners,

and took &s;everal di&s;tricts belonging to Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein, &s;uch as
Campul, Pattiali, Shum&s;eabad, Sickite, Marhera, Sittali, and Koli, appointing

as Arumbidger, the latter &s;tood his ground, and engaged Beloli. The victory
being dubious, a peace was patched up between them, the village of Doupamou
being &s;ettled as the boundary between the empires. After this pacification,
Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein proceeded to Ra|beri, and Sultan Beloli returned to
Delhi.</P>
<P>Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein could not, however, forget the perfidy of
Beloli. He recruited his army, and &s;ome time after marched again&s;t him, and
met him at the village of Sinhar, when an ob&s;tinate battle en|&s;ued, in
which Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein was defeated, and lo&s;t all his trea&s;ure and
baggage; which, together with an addition of reputation, greatly promoted the
affairs of Beloli. Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein having re|treated to Raberi, he was
followed thither by Beloli, and upon &s;tanding a &s;econd engagement, he was
again totally defeated. After the battle, he retreated towards Gualier; the
raja of Gualier brought him &s;ome lacks of rupees, elephants, hor&s;es,
camels, and a fine &s;et of camp equipage, and accompanied him to Calpie.</P>
<P>Sultan Beloli went, in the mean time, to Attava, where he
be|&s;ieged Ibrahim Chan, the brother of Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein, and took the place
by capitulation. He, however, generou&s;ly made him a pre&s;ent

proceeded to Calpie; Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein met him upon the banks of the river,
where they remained for &s;ome months. But Rai Muluck Chand of Buxar, coming
over to Sultan Beloli, &s;hewed him a pa&s;&s;able ford in the river, by which
he cro&s;&s;ed, and attacking Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein, defeated him, and drove him
to Jionpoor, upon which Sultan Beloli turned off to the left towards Kinnoge.
Sultan Ha&s;&s;ein again met him near that city, but he was once more defeat|ed
with great &s;laughter. His regalia and equipage were taken, and al&s;o the
chief lady of his &s;eraglio, Bibi Conzah, the daughter of Sultan Alla ul Dien,
who was treated with great re&s;pect. Sultan Beloli returned, after this
victory, to Delhi.</P>
<P>Having recruited and regulated his army, he advanced the &s;pear
of ho&s;tility again towards Jionpoor. He conquered that country, and gave it
to Mubarick Chan Lohani, leaving Cuttub Chan Lodi, Chan Jehan, and other
omrahs, at Migouli, to &s;ecure his conque&s;ts. He him&s;elf went to Budaoon,
where he &s;oon after heard of Cuttub Chan's death. Chan Jehan, Mubarick Chan,
and other omrahs, though they kept up the appearance of fidelity, were, after
the death of Cuttub, concerning mea&s;ures to throw off the &s;ultan's
yoke.</P>
<P>Beloli being apprized of their intentions, marched towards
Jion|poor, and drove away Ha&s;&s;ein, who had made an attempt to recover it,
and placed Barbee Shaw, one of his own &s;ons, upon the throne of Jionpoor. He
him&s;elf returned to Calpie, which he took, and gave to his grand&s;on, Azim
Hamaioon Ben Baizied. He directed then his march to Dolepore, rai&s;ing a
tribute upon the raja of that place, who began to rank him&s;elf among Beloli's
&s;ubjects. The &s;ultan went from thence to a place in the di&s;tricts of
Rintimpore, which he plundered, and &s;oon after returned to Delhi.</P>

Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni was not only a powerful emperor, but the country was,
at that time, divided into a number of kingdoms, which greatly facilitated his
enterprizes. Shab ul Dien Ghori brought an army of one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and men with him, when the king|dom <PB N="113" REF="120"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</NOTE>was not &s;o
powerful. The like may be &s;aid of Timur, who ra|vaged Hindo&s;tan when it was
torn to pieces by civil commotions. But the army of Sultan Baber was but a
handful in proportion to that of Sultan Ibrahim, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the
countries between the Sind and Behar, and could bring five hundred thou&s;and
men to the field; while Baber only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the poor countries of
Cabul, Buduch&s;han, and Candahar, the revenues of which were very
incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>To what then can we attribute this extraordinary conque&s;t, in a
natural light, but to the great abilities and experience of Baber, the bravery
of his few hardy troops, trained up to war, for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance, and
now fired with the hopes of glory and gain? But what contributed mo&s;t to
weigh down the &s;cale of conque&s;t, was the de|generacy of the Patans,
effeminated by luxury and wealth, and dead to all principles of virtue and
honor, which their corrupt factions and civil di&s;cords had totally effaced;
it being now no &s;hame to fly, no infamy to betray, no breach of honor to
murther, and no &s;candal to change parties. When, therefore, the fear of
&s;hame and the love of fame were gone, it was no wonder that a herd, without
unanimity, order, or di&s;cipline, &s;hould fall into the hands of a few brave
men. This is the general tendency of wealth in all governments, if the reins

&s;ons of renown, who were all kings, and the fathers of nations. Their names
were Oktai Cha&acirc;n, Chigittai Chan, Judgi Chan, and Tooli Chan. Though

Mahummud HUMAIOON, immediately after the death of Baber, mounted the throne of

conference with Shaw Tama&s;p, the &s;on of Shaw I&s;maiel Suffvi, and was
royally entertained.</P>
<P>The king of Iran, one day, in conver&s;ation, a&s;ked Humaioon, By
what means his weak enemy became &s;o powerful? Humaioon re|plied, 
<Q REND="inline">"By the enmity of my brothers."</Q> The Per&s;ian
then told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"The political manner of treating brothers is not
&s;uch as they re|ceived from you."</Q> And being, at that time, at table, as
&s;oon as Shaw Tama&s;p was done eating, Byram Mirza, his brother, who attended

that he never after could forgive him, while he re|&s;ided at court. He took
every opportunity to calumniate Humaioon to the king, and was ever harping in
his ears, how much again&s;t the intere&s;t of Per&s;ia it was, that a prince
of the line of Timur &s;hould &s;it <PB N="191" REF="199"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1544. Hig. 951.</NOTE>upon the throne of
Hindo&s;tan. This maxim Byram Mirza took care to inculcate upon all who had the
king's confidence. This circum|&s;tance greatly retarded the affairs of
Humaioon, and, at length, wrought &s;o vi&s;ibly upon the king's
di&s;po&s;ition, that the unfortunate fugitive began to fear death or
impri&s;onment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king's &s;i&s;ter and &s;ome omrahs favor

the king. The wit of Sultanum Begum had a great effect upon this occa&s;ion.
She, one day, produced a &s;tanza of ver&s;es to the king, of her own
compo&s;ition, in the name of Humaioon, extolling his devotion and happy turn
of expre&s;&s;ion in the prai&s;e of Ali. This greatly plea&s;ed Tama&s;p,
zealous for the &s;ect of the Shiahs, who differ from the Sinnites, the &s;ect
who&s;e tenets Humaioon followed. The Shiahs hold Ali to be the only
a&s;&s;i&s;tant of Mahommed in his apo&s;tolic function, but the Sinnites
believe in four, adding O&s;man, Omar, and Abubecker to Ali.</P>
<P>The king, in &s;hort, told his &s;i&s;ter, That if Humaioon
&s;hould be|come a Shiah, and enforce that doctrine in Hindo&s;tan, he would
a&s;&s;i&s;t him to recover his empire. Sultanum Begum having acquainted
Humaioon of the&s;e particulars, he was not &s;o much wedded to a &s;ect, as to

&s;ays that great man, one of the king's elephants in the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tting &s;ea&s;on, attacked an elephant
of Byram Chan and killed him. Byram, for this offence, commanded that the
keeper of the king's ele|phants &s;hould be put to death, without giving any
notice to the &s;ultan. Akbar was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with this piece of
cruelty, e&s;pecially when he found that the poor man was innocent, having
lo&s;t all his command over the outrageous animal. Soon after, continues Abul
Fazil, as Byram Chan was taking his plea&s;ure in a barge on the river, one of
the elephants, which had been carried down to the water, run furiou&s;ly
again&s;t the barge, and had almo&s;t &s;unk it, before, by the uncommon
efforts of the rider, he was brought to obedience. The mini&s;ter, na|turally
of a &s;u&s;picious and unforgiving temper, imagined that the&s;e were actually
plots laid again&s;t his life; and he publickly petitioned the king to puni&s;h
the rider of the elephant. The king, to appea&s;e Byram, and to remove all
&s;u&s;picions, ordered that the elephant-rider &s;hould be &s;ent to him, to
be puni&s;hed at di&s;cretion. But Byram, either to make an example to others,
or to gratify his re&s;entment again&s;t the innocent man, who might even be
&s;aid to have &s;aved his life, ordered him al&s;o to be put to death.</P>
<P>The king was highly incen&s;ed by the&s;e two in&s;tances of

required &s;ome delicacy in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs. Some authors

which was the &s;ole cau&s;e of that Omrah's rebellion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A digre&s;&s;ion concerning A&s;aph Chan's war
with the queen of Gur|rah.</NOTE>It &s;eems, that when A&s;aph Chan was made an
Omrah of five thou&s;and, and obtained the government of Kurrah and Maneckpoor,
he obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the king to &s;ubdue a country called Gurrah or
Kattuck, lying between the provinces of Rintimpore, Malava, Behar and the
Decan. At that time, the kingdom of Gurrah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now part of
Ori&s;&s;a and Bundel-cund.</NOTE> was governed by a queen, who&s;e name was
Durgautti, famous for her beauty and accompli&s;hments: her dominions were
about one hundred and fifty crores in length, <PB N="240" REF="250"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>and about fifty in
breadth: yet &s;o flouri&s;hing was the country, that in this &s;mall tract,
there were about &s;eventy thou&s;and towns and villages well inhabited; which
had the good fortune never to have fallen under the dominion of foreigners.</P>
<P>A&s;aph Chan, having heard of the riches of this country,
di&s;|turbed the peaceable inhabitants, unaccu&s;tomed to the &s;ound of war,
with con&s;tant depredations; he at length marched again&s;t them with &s;ix
thou&s;and hor&s;e, and about double that number of infantry. The queen, with
fifteen hundred elephants, eight thou&s;and hor&s;e and &s;ome foot, prepared
to oppo&s;e him. Like a bold Heroine &s;he led on her troops to action,
cloathed in armour, with a helmet upon her head, mounted in a howdar, on an
ele|phant, with her bow and quiver lying by her &s;ide, and a burni&s;hed lance
in her hand. Though her troops had not been accu&s;tomed to action, the love of
liberty, and the example of their queen, in&s;pired every brea&s;t with a
lion's courage. Their eagerne&s;s to engage, made them march in di&s;order
towards the enemy, which the queen ob&s;erving, commanded them to halt, and
forming her line anew, gave her troops &s;trict orders to march on &s;lowly, as
compact as po&s;&s;ible, and to ob&s;erve the &s;ignal to engage, when it
&s;hould be di&s;played from the elephant of the royal &s;tandard.</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he received the enemy, whom &s;he quickly
re|pul&s;ed, and pre&s;&s;ing upon them, laid &s;ix hundred Mahommedan
hor&s;emen dead on the field; &s;he pur&s;ued the re&s;t till the evening, with
great &s;laughter. When night came on, the queen halted with her army, and gave
them orders to wa&s;h and refre&s;h them|&s;elves, that they might be prepared
for a night attack upon the enemy, before they could recover from their
con&s;ternation. But her vizier, and the re&s;t of her chiefs, le&s;s daring,

than this heroine, oppo&s;ed this &s;alutary mea|&s;ure, and &s;editiou&s;ly
in&s;i&s;ted on returning to the field of battle to bury their friends. She,
accordingly, returned unwillingly; and, after the dead were burnt, again
addre&s;&s;ed her chiefs, and &s;oli|cited them, one by one, to accompany her
to &s;torm the Mahom|medan camp: none of them, however, had the &s;pirit to
&s;econd her in this daring enterprize. They vainly imagined, that the enemy
would of their own accord evacuate the country.</P>
<P>The Omrahs of Gurrah, &s;oon found that they were fatally
fru&s;trated in their hopes. A&s;aph Chan, to wipe away the di&s;|grace which
he &s;u&s;tained the day before, and finding what enemy he had to deal with,
advanced in the morning towards the queen, with his artillery; which, in the
preceding action, he had left behind him, on account of the badne&s;s of the
roads. The queen, upon A&s;aph's approach, advanced to a narrow pa&s;s, and
prepared to oppo&s;e him. The Mogul, &s;couring the pa&s;s with his artillery,
&s;oon opened to him&s;elf a way into the plain beyond it, where the queen's
army were drawn up in order of battle. Raja Bier Shaw, the queen's &s;on, a
young prince of great hopes, as &s;oon as the Mahommedan army came into the
plain, made a re&s;olute charge, and exhibited prodigies of valour. He
repul&s;ed the enemy twice, but in the third attack, being wounded, he became
faint with lo&s;s of blood. When he was ju&s;t falling from his hor&s;e, his
mother, who was mounted on an elephant in the front of the battle, ob&s;erved
her &s;on ready to expire. She immediately called to &s;ome of her people to
carry him back to the rear; many of them accordingly crowded around him, &s;ome
with a friendly in|tention to &s;erve him, but more to have an opportunity to
quit the field. The lo&s;s of the Raja, in &s;hort, together with the retreat
of &s;o many with his body, &s;truck a pannic into the re&s;t, &s;o that the
unfortunate queen was left with only three hundred men in <PB N="242" REF="252"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>in the field. The
heroine, however, &s;eemed no ways affected by her de&s;perate &s;ituation;
&s;he &s;tood her ground with her former fortitude, till &s;he received an
arrow in her eye; &s;he endeavoured to extricate it from the wound, but as
&s;he tugged it, part of the &s;teel broke &s;hort, and remained behind. In the
mean time, another arrow pa&s;&s;ed through her neck, which &s;he al&s;o drew
out, but nature &s;inking under the pain, a dimne&s;s &s;wam before her eyes,
and &s;he began to nod from &s;ide to &s;ide of the howdar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wooden tower on the back of the elephant.</NOTE>. She, however,
recovered from her fainting by degrees; and a brave officer of her hou&s;hold,
by name Adhar, who drove her elephant, &s;ingly repul&s;ed numbers of the enemy
whither&s;oever he turned the outragious animal; begged permi&s;&s;ion, as the
day was now irretrievable, to carry the queen from the field. She re|jected the
propo&s;al with a noble di&s;dain: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is true, &s;aid &s;he, we are overcome in war,
but &s;hall we ever be vanqui&s;hed in honor? Shall we, for the &s;ake of a
lingering ignominious life, lo&s;e that reputation and virtue which we have
been &s;o &s;olicitous to ac|quire? No: let your gratitude now repay that
&s;ervice for which I lifted up your head, and which I now require at your
hands. Ha&s;te, I &s;ay; let your dagger &s;ave me from the crime of putting a
period to my own exi&s;tence."</Q></P>
<P>Adhar bur&s;t into tears, and begged, that as the elephant was
&s;wift of foot, he might be permitted to leave the field, and carry her to a
place of &s;afety. In the mean time, the queen, finding that the enemy crowded
fa&s;t around her, and that &s;he mu&s;t be taken pri&s;oner, &s;he, &s;uddenly
leaning forward, &s;eized the dagger of Adhar, and plunging it into her
bo&s;om, expired. The death of the queen, rendered A&s;aph Chan's victory
compleat. Six Hindoo chiefs, upon their elephants, &s;till &s;tood firm: and
a&s;hamed <PB N="245" REF="253"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>of being outdone
by a woman, dedicated their lives to revenge the death of the queen.</P>
<P>A&s;aph Chan, a few days after this battle, laid &s;iege to
Joragur, where all the trea&s;ures of this noble family had been for ten
ge|nerations depo&s;ited. The hopes of gain rendered the Moguls de&s;perate;
they begun to attack the fort with uncommon re&s;olu|tion, till the place was
taken. The young Raja, bravely exert|ing what little &s;trength he had left,
lo&s;t his life in defence of his independence and kingdom. The unfortunate
garri&s;on, accord|ing to their barbarous cu&s;tom, had performed the joar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The joar, is a general ma&s;&s;acre of the women and
children.</NOTE>. This dreadful ceremony was performed after this manner: a
hou&s;e was filled with wood, &s;traw and oil; the unfortunate victims were
forced in, and fire &s;et to the horrid pile. When the bloody con|querors, who
had brought this dreadful calamity upon the mi&s;er|able Hindoos, entered the
place, they found two women &s;till alive, and untouched by the flames; one of
them was called Camela|willi, the &s;i&s;ter of the decea&s;ed queen, and the
other the daughter of the Raja of Biragur, who had been brought to be
e&s;pou&s;ed by the young Raja of Gurrah. The&s;e two ladies were re&s;erved by
A&s;aph Chan, for the king. The riches of Joragur, in gold, &s;ilver, jewels
and precious effects were invaluable; of gold alone, there were found, in one
trea&s;ury, one hundred and one che&s;ts of mhers. When A&s;aph Chan had
glutted his avarice and ambition with the blood and trea&s;ure of this brave,
though peace|able family, he took up his re&s;idence in that country. His view
was to maintain his conque&s;t agai&s;t the king; and he, therefore, did not
return to his government of Kurrah. That avarice, which prompted him to this
public robbery, prevented him from pre|&s;enting the king with his part of the
plunder. Out of a thou&s;and <PB N="244" REF="254"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>elephants, which
he had taken, though all &s;hould fall to the &s;hare of the king, he &s;ent
him only two hundred of the wor&s;t, and &s;ent no part of the jewels and
trea&s;ure. It was therefore this ju&s;t demand which the king had upon
A&s;aph, that made that ambitious Omrah join in rebellion with the
di&s;affected U&s;becks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king marches again&s;t A&s;aph Chan: falls

of the king's light &s;couts, pene|trated through the camp of the rebels as far
as the tents of Chan Ziman, where he was repul&s;ed by Bahadur Chan, and driven
back with precipitation among the king's ranks, which occa|&s;ioned &s;ome
di&s;order among the files of Mudgenu Chan. Bahadur Chan in the mean time
turned towards the center, where the king commanded in per&s;on: Akbar
ob&s;erving him, came down from his elephant, and mounting a hor&s;e,
pre&s;&s;ed towards him; but by this time an arrow having killed Bahadur Chan's
hor&s;e, he was obliged to retreat on foot, among his own troops. The king

Akbar, thus to provoke you to draw the &s;word of trea&s;on again&s;t me? He
ordered that particular care &s;hould be taken of Bahadur; but &s;ome of the
Omrahs, as &s;oon as the king's back was turned, fear|ing that his clemency
would pardon that con&s;ummate rebel, prevented it by putting him immediately
to the &s;word. Akbar, though it is highly probable that he would have forgiven
Ba|hadur, made no inquiries concerning his death. The heads of the brothers
were &s;ent to Punjab and Cabul. Jan Alli Beg U&s;|beck, Ear Alli, Mirza Beg,
Chu&s;hal Beg, and Mier Shaw Ma|hummud Buduch&s;i, were al&s;o taken

taken great advantage of the king's di&s;tre&s;s. This determined Akbar,
without remaining long at Agra, to march again&s;t him. The king having arrived
before the fort of Sui&s;oob, the governor evacuated the place and retreated to
his ma&s;ter Surjun Raja of Rintimpore. Akbar left a garri&s;on in Sui&s;oob,
and proceeded to the fort of Kakeran, on the frontiers of Malava. The &s;ons of
Sultan Mahummud Mirza, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Mindu, hearing
of the emperor's progre&s;s, were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. To compleat their

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king in|ve&s;ts Chitor.</NOTE>The king left
Malava under the charge of Shab ul dein Ahmed Shaw Ne&s;hapuri, and marched
from Kakeran to expel the Rana from Chitor. The Rana left eight thou&s;and
di&s;ciplined Rajaputs, with a great &s;tore of provi&s;ions in the fort of
Chitor, which is built on a mountain, and retired him&s;elf with his family to
an inacce&s;&s;ible place. The king immediately inve&s;ted Chitor, and &s;et
five thou&s;and pioneers to work in throwing up trenches, and carrying on
approaches to the place. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An accident in carrying on the
&s;iege.</NOTE>When he had completed two batteries, and carried two mines under
different ba&s;tions, he endevoured to &s;pirng them at once: but one of them
going off before the other, blew up one of the ba&s;tions and made

breach. Two thou&s;and men who were prepared to &s;torm, advanced immediately,
upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that both of the mines had been &s;prung. They divided
into two bodies in order to enter at once both breaches: one of the parties
advanc|ing near the ba&s;tion, perceived that the mine had not been &s;prung,
but before they could retreat it blew up, and killed above five hundred of the
Moguls, and about double that number of the enemy who were crouded on the
ba&s;tion. Among the latter were fifteen Omrahs of di&s;tinction. The
explo&s;ion &s;o terrified tho&s;e who were entering the breach, that they

governor of the place very a&s;&s;iduous in filling up the breaches, and giving
orders for the defence: the king immedi|ately called for a fuzee, and took &s;o
good an aim that he lodged the ball in Jeimal's brains, and laid him dead on
the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the be&s;ieged fell with their chief, and in the

perceived what was going on by the light of the fire: they advanced under the

entered the place without oppo&s;ition. It was day-light before a number
&s;ufficient to attack the enemy could enter: then the king in per|&s;on led on
his men, and the unfortunate garri&s;on devoting them|&s;elves to death, had
retired to their temples. Akbar perceiving that he mu&s;t lo&s;e a great number

became now too &s;hocking to be de&s;cribed. Brave men rendered more valiant by

Rajaputs like gra&s;shoppers under their feet, or winding them in their

<P>But as, to tran&s;late from the Per&s;ian language is a ta&s;k
of labor and difficulty, his engaging further, in works of this kind, will
depend entirely upon the reception the public &s;hall give to his fir&s;t
attempt in that way. If he &s;hall find that he is not capable to acquit
him&s;elf, in &s;ome degree, to the &s;atisfaction of the world, he will, in
prudence, lay down his pen; and leave that field to men of greater abilities,
who may hereafter turn their thoughts to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The tran&s;actions of the court of Delhi, &s;ince the inva&s;ion
of Nadir Shaw, are very little known in the We&s;t. They have not, even in
A&s;ia, been hitherto committed to writing; and if the pre&s;ent confu&s;ions
of the Mogul empire &s;hall long continue, it is probable the memory of them
will die with tho&s;e who were principally concerned in them. This
con&s;ideration has induced the tran&s;lator of Feri&s;hta's hi&s;tory, to
throw together the mo&s;t material events, which happened in the empire,
&s;ince the memo|rable irruption of the Per&s;ians, in the year 1738. He
derives his authority, for &s;ome of the facts, from a Per&s;ian manu&s;cript,
now in his hands, concerning &s;ix years of the reign of Mahummud Shaw; and as
to the re&s;t, he principally follows a &s;hort &s;ketch of the affairs of the
empire, given to him in writing, by his intimate friend the Rai Rai&acirc;n,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate to the pre&s;ent mogul.</P>
<P>To continue the line of connection, between the preceding
hi&s;tory and the reign of Mahummud Shaw, who &s;at upon the throne of Delhi
when the inva&s;ion of Nadir Shaw happened, it may not be improper, ju&s;t to
mention the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the kings, <PB N="3" REF="311"> from Akbar to
that period. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, after con&s;ulting the
mo&s;t authentic Per&s;ian hi&s;tories, the author of this account finds
him&s;elf obliged to differ from all the European writers, who have treated on
the &s;ubject, with regard to the du|ration of mo&s;t of the reigns.</P>

long tyrannized in the empire, rai&s;ing and de|po&s;ing kings at plea&s;ure,
gave him&s;elf wholly up to indolence, and the enervating plea&s;ures of the

principally by the ambition of the Seids, gave the fir&s;t mortal wound to the
Mogul empire, under which it has ever &s;ince langui&s;hed. Mo&s;t of the

formed ambitious &s;chemes of independence in their re&s;pective provinces,

<P>Cuttulich Chan, who, as Nizam ul muluck, commanded all the

Hindoo Rajas and Mahrattor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are they, who are

But the real de&s;ign of this force was to found an inde|pendent kingdom for
the Nizam in the Decan, as Ha&s;&s;en Caco Bemeni had done in the reign of
Tuglick Shaw<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Ha&s;&s;en Caco mounted the

the title of &s;ultan Alla ul Dien.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To facilitate his ambitious views, the Nizam ul muluck began to
extend his power in the Decan, by the reduction of the neighbouring Rajas.
Though the revenues of his government mu&s;t have been very con&s;iderably
increa&s;ed by the&s;e conque&s;ts, he remitted none to the Delhi; and, at the
&s;ame time, to weaken the empire, he encouraged, or at lea&s;t, permitted the
Mahrattors to make ho&s;tile incur&s;ions into the interior provinces. The&s;e
ir|regular marauders ravaged the kingdoms of Malava, Narvar, Biana and Ajmere,
in &s;uch a manner, that no revenues could be paid by the unfortunate
inhabitants.</P>
<P>The weak Mahummud, in&s;tead of checking this in&s;olence by the
&s;word, di&s;graced the dignity of the hou&s;e of Timur, by &s;ubmitting to
become, in a manner, tributary to the&s;e de&s;picable banditti. He agreed to
pay them the Chout, or fourth part of the revenues of tho&s;e provinces, which
had been &s;ubject to their <PB N="6" REF="314"> depredations. From this
pu&s;illanimous conduct of Mahummud, we may date the irretrievable decline of
the Mogul empire. That opinion, which &s;upports government in every country,
was now de&s;troyed in India; and each petty chieftain began to &s;tart into a
prince, as he had nothing to fear from a government which had betrayed &s;uch
evident &s;ymptoms of timidity.</P>
<P>Chan Dowran Sum&s;am ul Dowla was, at this time, Amir ul Omrah,
or captain-general of the empire. As the offices of payma&s;ter-general and
commander in chief of the troops are injudiciou&s;ly joined in one per&s;on, in
Hindo&s;tan, Chan Dowran had &s;uch an influence in the &s;tate, that he
engro&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf all the mini&s;terial power. He left, in &s;hort,
nothing but their names in the government to the king and his vizier, Kimmir ul
Dien Chan.</P>
<P>Chan Dowran was &s;ly, artful, in&s;inuating; of an active and
intriguing di&s;po&s;ition; in appearance a&s;&s;uming no authority, when, at
the &s;ame time, he directed every thing. He executed, in public, as by the
king's orders, whatever he him&s;elf had re&s;olved upon in private. As the
indolent Mahummud was even aver&s;e to the trouble of thinking, the
&s;ugge&s;tions of this artful Omrah, who was full of plau&s;ibility, and
prompt to execute whatever he advi&s;ed, were always grateful to the royal ear.
The captain-general, though per&s;onally brave, permitted his ma&s;ter's
authority to be daily in&s;ulted by de&s;picable enemies. He fore&s;aw that to
take the field, without the king, would probably put an end to his influence
over him; for he knew that the di&s;po&s;ition of Mahummud was &s;ickle and
incon&s;tant; and apt to be &s;wayed to any thing, by every artful per&s;on
near him.</P>
<P>Dowran made many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to per&s;uade
Ma|hummud to accompany him to the field. The di&s;&s;olute monarch was not to
be removed from the luxurious indolence of the <PB N="7" REF="315"> palace. The
Mahrattors, in the mean time, continued their inroads. They ravaged the
province of Guzerat, and rai&s;ed the Chout as far as the Indus. They returned
back from that river, by the way of Ajmere and Biana, and &s;pread their
deva&s;ta|tions to the very gates of Agra.</P>
<P>The captain-general, though much again&s;t his inclination,
found him&s;elf obliged to march again&s;t the&s;e plunderers. But, in&s;tead
of cha&s;ti&s;ing them, he ingloriou&s;ly promi&s;ed to pay them the Chout,
upon condition they &s;hould immediately evacuate the provinces.</P>
<P>The barbarians, gaining courage by this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and
tru&s;t|ing very little to promi&s;es extorted by fear, from Dowran,
cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna, near Calpee, with a de&s;ign to plunder the province of
Oud. Sadit Chan, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that &s;uba&s;hip, oppo&s;ed them,
between the rivers in the di&s;trict of Korah, and gave them a total defeat.
They fled to Feridabad near Delhi, whither they were clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by
Sadit, who had, on his way, joined the imperial army under Dowran.</P>
<P>Before the united armies under Dowran and Sadit came up, the
Mahrattors made an attempt to plunder Delhi. They were oppo&s;ed, without the
walls, by two imperial Omrahs, Ha&s;&s;en Chan and Amir Chan, the former of
whom was killed in the action. The Mahrattors had now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of the &s;uburbs, when Kimmir the vizier, coming up with an army,
put them to flight. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e repeated defeats, the
Mahrattors found means to retreat, with a great booty to the Decan.</P>
<P>The king and his mini&s;ters, finding that the Nizam of the
Decan favored the incur&s;ions of the Mahrattors, devi&s;ed many 
<PB N="8" REF="316"> &s;chemes to inveigle him to court, that they might
deprive him either of his life or government. The crafty Nizam, pene|trating
into their de&s;igns, conceived an implacable re&s;entment again&s;t Chan
Dowran, who, he knew, was at the bottom of the whole affair. But as the empire,
notwith&s;tanding its grow|ing imbecillity, was &s;till &s;ufficiently &s;trong
to reduce the Nizam, had he broke forth in open rebellion, he thought it mo&s;t
prudent to obey the royal command. He, however, previou&s;ly, &s;trength|ened
his intere&s;t at court, by a coalition with many great Omrahs, who were
di&s;gu&s;ted with the in&s;olence of Dowran.</P>
<P>Cuttulich Chan, having taken a &s;tep &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for his
own &s;afety, &s;et out for court, leaving his &s;on Ghazi ul Dien in the
govern|ment of the Decan. He arrived at Agra, with a retinue, or rather an army
of 20000 men; and, as he held the office of Vakeel Muttuluch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the nature of this office &s;ee the preface.</NOTE>, he
expected to command Chan Dowran, and to draw all the reins of government into
his own hands.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, Suba of Oud, pluming him&s;elf upon his &s;ucce&s;s
again&s;t the Mahrattors, a&s;pired to the mini&s;terial power. The king
continued to favor Dowran, and to &s;upport him again&s;t the Nizam; for,
however weak Mahummud was, he could not but &s;ee through that ambitious
governor's de&s;igns, by his behavior for &s;ome years back. But, as the Nizam
had, upon the &s;pot, a force to protect his per&s;on, and a &s;trong party at
court; and as his &s;on, a man of great parts, commanded all the provinces of
the Decan, the king was a&s;&s;ured, that to deprive Cuttulich Chan of his
government, would occa&s;ion a revolt, which, in its con&s;e|quences, might
prove fatal to the royal hou&s;e of Timur.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sadit Chan, finding that he could not effect
any thing again&s;t the united intere&s;ts of the Nizam and vizier, 
<PB N="9" REF="317"> who had joined factions, was ea&s;ily brought over to
their party. The terms of this coalition were, that when the Nizam and Vizier
&s;hould force them&s;elves into the management of the affairs of government,
Sadit Chan &s;hould be appointed buck&s;hi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Payma&s;ter-general of the forces.</NOTE>, with the title of Amir
ul omrah, which Dowran at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Sadit and his party did not render the
faction of the Nizam and Vizier &s;ufficiently &s;trong to turn Dowran from his
high employ. He had ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the royal ear, and the
army, who depended upon him for their pay, remained firm to his intere&s;t. The
faction of the malcontents was reduced to de&s;pair; and Nizam ul muluck, to
gratify his re&s;entment again&s;t Dowran, concerted, with Sadit, a plan, which
gave the la&s;t &s;troke to the tottering authority of the crown.</P>
<P>The famous Nadir Shaw, king of Per&s;ia, was, at this juncture,
in the province of Candahar. The di&s;affected Omrahs re&s;olved to invite him
to Hindo&s;tan. They fore&s;aw that a Per&s;ian inva&s;ion would occa&s;ion
confu&s;ions and di&s;tractions in the empire, which mu&s;t facilitate their
own &s;chemes of independence in their re&s;pective governments; it mu&s;t, at
any rate, ruin Chan Dowran, which was a very capital object to men
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch inveterate animo&s;ities again&s;t that
mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Whether the Nizam did not even extend his views to the empire
it&s;elf, admits of &s;ome doubt. Many &s;en&s;ible men in India think that he
did; and affirm, that his opinion was, that Nadir Shaw would depo&s;e Mahummud;
and, to &s;ecure his conque&s;t, extirpate the family of Timur: he argued with
him&s;elf, that as it was not probable that the Per&s;ian would fix his
re&s;idence in Hin|do&s;tan, he hoped, for his &s;ervices, to &s;ecure to
him&s;elf the vice|roy&s;hip <PB N="10" REF="318"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>of that empire; and that
afterwards time and circum|&s;tances would point out the line of his future
proceedings.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e ambitious projects, and at the &s;ame time to
avenge him&s;elf of his political enemy, the Nizam, in conjunction with Sadit,
wrote to Nadir Shaw. That monarch received their letters at Candahar, and, in
an an&s;wer to them, pointed out many difficulties which he had to &s;urmount
in the pro|po&s;ed inva&s;ion. He repre&s;ented to them, that it would be
extremely difficult to penetrate even into Cabul and Pe&s;hawir, which
provinces Na&s;ir Chan had governed for twenty years, with great reputation,
and kept in pay a formidable army of Moguls and Afgans: that &s;hould he even
force his way through the government of Na&s;ir, there were five great rivers
to cro&s;s in Punj&acirc;b, where Zekirriah Chan, &s;ubad&acirc;r of Lahore,
would cer|tainly oppo&s;e him; and that even &s;hould he get over tho&s;e
ob|&s;tacles, the imperial army &s;till remained to be defeated.</P>
<P>Nizam ul muluck, and his colleague in trea&s;on, endeavoured to
remove the king's objections, by a&s;&s;uring him, that they would bring over
the governors of the frontier provinces to their faction; and that, as they
them&s;elves commanded one half of the imperial army, little danger was to be
dreaded from the other. Nadir Shaw began his march from Candahar, with a great
army, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE>about the vernal equinox of the
1149 of the Higera. He took the rout of Ghizni, and the governor of that city
came out with pre&s;ents, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf and the province to the
king, agreeing to pay the u&s;ual revenues to Per&s;ia. Nadir Shaw continued
his march from Ghizni to Cabul, which city he im|mediately inve&s;ted. Shirza
Chan, an omra of &s;eventy years of age, was, at this time, governor of Cabul.
Being &s;ummoned, <PB N="11" REF="319"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>he refu&s;ed to &s;urrender,
and made the proper di&s;po&s;itions for an ob&s;tinate defence.</P>
<P>The king of Per&s;ia finding that neither fair promi&s;es nor
threats could induce Shirza to open the gates of Cabul, a&s;&s;aulted the place
for &s;ix days together. In this de&s;perate manner, many of the brave&s;t
&s;oldiers, who &s;uffer mo&s;t upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, fell; without making
any impre&s;&s;ion on the be&s;ieged: upon the &s;eventh day, Nadir Shaw found
means to bring over to his party Na&s;ir Chan, governor of the province of
Cabul, the &s;on of that Na&s;ir, who was, for twenty years, &s;ubad&acirc;r of
Pe&s;hawir. That traitor, with the provincial army, pre&s;ented him&s;elf at
that gate of the city which was oppo&s;ite to the &s;ide of the attack, and
&s;ent a letter to the gallant Shirza. He reque&s;ted immediate admittance to
the place, to prevent his being cut off by the enemy; in&s;inuating, that his
forces, when joined with the gar|ri&s;on, would be a match for the Per&s;ians
in the field.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Shirza, not &s;u&s;pecting the treachery of the
young Omrah, con&s;ented to receive within the walls the women and baggage of
the provincial army; but in&s;i&s;ted that the troops &s;hould encamp before
the gate, till they &s;hould con&s;ult together what was be&s;t to be done upon
this urgent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The women and baggage were accordingly admitted, with a proper
guard, and Shirza, with a few attendants, went out to have an interview with
Na&s;ir. No &s;ooner was Shirza out of the city, than the king of Per&s;ia
began a general a&s;&s;ault; while one Abdul Rahim, an officer of the traitor
Na&s;ir, &s;eized upon Shirza, and confined him.</P>
<P> <PB N="12" REF="320"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>The two &s;ons of Shirza,
ignorant of their father's fate, in the mean time defended the gates with great
firmne&s;s and re&s;olution; till one of them was killed by that part of
Na&s;ir's army that had been admitted into the city. The remaining brother, in
this de&s;perate &s;ituation, knew not which enemy he ought to oppo&s;e, while
the garri&s;on, &s;truck with terror and confu&s;ion, de&s;erted their po&s;ts
upon the wall. Nadir Shaw took advantage of this panick, forced open the gates,
took the place, ma&s;&s;acred many of the inhabitants, and inhumanly put to
death the gallant Shirza Chan and his &s;on.</P>
<P>The king of Per&s;ia found in the trea&s;ury of Cabul two crores
of roupees, and effects to the value of two crores more: in the&s;e were
included four thou&s;and complete &s;uits of armour, in|laid with gold; four
thou&s;and of poli&s;hed &s;teel, four thou&s;and mails for hor&s;es, and a
great quantity of fine ti&s;&s;ues and dre&s;&s;es, depo&s;ited in Cabul by
Shaw Jehan. Nadir Shaw remained at Cabul &s;even months, before he would
attempt to cro&s;s the Indus. He, in the mean time, kept up a corre&s;pondence
with the con|&s;pirators in Delhi, and maturely &s;ettled his plan of
operations. He, at length, put his army in motion, and directed his march to
Pi&s;hawir.</P>
<P>Na&s;ir Chan, &s;ubadar of Pi&s;hawir, had wrote, repeatedly, to
the court of Delhi, for &s;uccours; but Chan Dowran, in his an&s;wers, affected
to de&s;pi&s;e the king of Per&s;ia; and in&s;inuated, that it was
impo&s;&s;ible he could meditate the conque&s;t of Hin|do&s;tan. He, however,
promi&s;ed, from time to time, that he him&s;elf would march with the imperial
army, and drive the invader back to Per&s;ia. The di&s;affected Omrahs wrote,
at the &s;ame time, to Na&s;ir, to make the be&s;t terms he could with Nadir 
<PB N="13" REF="321"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>Shaw; for that there was
little hopes of his being reinforced with any part of the royal army.</P>
<P>Na&s;ir Chan, finding him&s;elf neglected by the court, after a
faint re&s;i&s;tance, &s;urrendered him&s;elf pri&s;oner to the king of
Per&s;ia, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Novemb. 20.</NOTE>upon the 20th of
Shab&acirc;n. He was &s;oon after taken into favor by that monarch, and
appointed one of his viziers. Nadir Shaw had, by this time, cro&s;&s;ed the
Attock or the Nil&acirc;b, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the five
branches of the Indus. He i&s;&s;ued out an order to ravage the country, to
&s;pread the terror of his arms far and wide.</P>
<P>Daily advices of the approach of the Per&s;ians came to Delhi. A
general con&s;ternation among the people, and a di&s;traction in the councils
of the government en&s;ued. The king and his mi|ni&s;ter, Dowran, were &s;o
weak, that either they did not &s;u&s;pect the treachery of the di&s;affected
Omrahs, or took no mea&s;ures to prevent their de&s;igns. New ob&s;tacles were
daily thrown in the way of the military preparations of Dowran, till the Nizam
and his colleagues thought, that the procra&s;tination which they had
occa&s;ioned, had &s;ufficiently weakened the imperial cau&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">December 1.</NOTE>Upon the fir&s;t of Ramzan,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 14.</NOTE>upon the 14th of Zicada,
appeared in &s;ight of the imperial army. Mahummud Shaw was incamped upon the
plains of Karnal; &s;o that only the canal, which &s;upplied Delhi with water,
divided the armies. The Moguls had only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that
ground about two days before the arrival of Nadir Shaw, and had thrown up
entrenchments and redoubts before them, mounted with five hundred pieces of
artillery. The army, which the king now commanded in per&s;on, con&s;i&s;ted of
150,000 hor&s;e, ex|clu&s;ive of irregular infantry. This unweildy body of
militia was compo&s;ed of all &s;orts of people, collected indi&s;criminately
in the provinces, by the Omrahs, who thought that a &s;ufficient number of men
and hor&s;es was all that was nece&s;&s;ary to form a good army. Subordination
was a thing unknown in the Mogul camp: the private &s;oldier, as well as the
Omrah, acted only by the impul&s;e of his own mind.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, though not &s;o numerous as the Moguls, were
under &s;ome degree of regulation. The rank of Nadir Shaw's officers was
determined; and his own commands were in&s;tantly and implicitly obeyed. Severe
to exce&s;s, he pardoned no neglect or di&s;obedience in his Omrahs. He has
even been known to &s;end an e&s;&s;awil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A
mace-bearer.</NOTE> to a general, at the head of 5000 hor&s;e; with orders to
make him halt and receive corporal puni&s;hment, for a mi&s;demeanor, in the
front of his own men. Though this rigor may be thought in Europe too tyrannical
and repugnant to a mi|litary &s;pirit; yet, in a country where the principles
of honor are <PB N="15" REF="323"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>little known, fear is the
&s;tronge&s;t motive to a &s;trict performance of duty.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 14.</NOTE>upon the 14th of Zicada,
having out-marched his baggage, joined the imperial army. Ju&s;t as he was
receiving an honorary dre&s;s from Mahummud Shaw, advice came that the Herawils
of Nadir Shaw had attacked his baggage. Sadit Chan reque&s;ted of the king to
be permitted to march out again&s;t the Herawils. The whole of this attack was
a plan concerted between Nadir Shaw and the traitor, in order to draw the
Mo|guls from their entrenchments. The king, however, laid his commands upon
Sadit to wait until the next morning, when, 
<Q REND="inline">"by the favor of God,"</Q> he intended to march
out, with his whole army, to give the Per&s;ians battle.</P>
<P>But &s;o little did Sadit regard Mahummud's orders, that, as
&s;oon as he had quitted the pre&s;ence, he i&s;&s;ued out with 10000 hor&s;e,
which he had brought from his government, and attacked the enemy. A mock
engagement now commenced, between Sadit and a part of the Per&s;ian army; who
were ordered to retreat before him. He &s;ent repeated me&s;&s;ages, from the
field to the king, reque&s;ting more troops, and that he would drive the enemy
back to Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Mahummud, ju&s;tly incen&s;ed at the di&s;obedience of Sadit,
would not, for &s;ome time, permit any &s;uccours to be &s;ent to him. Chan
Dowran, at length, prevailed with the king to permit him, with 15000 men, to
&s;upport Sadit. When Chan Dowran came up to the field, Sadit, in a feigned
attack, joined the Per&s;ians, and permitted him&s;elf to be taken pri&s;oner.
His de&s;ign was to get the &s;tart of his partner in trea&s;on, Nizam ul
muluck, in en|gaging the Per&s;ian monarch in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P> <PB N="16" REF="324"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>In the mean time, the troops of Sadit being &s;trangers to
the treachery of their commander, joined Chan Dowran, and con|tinued the
engagement. Chan Dowran was immediately attacked on all &s;ides, by the bulk of
the Per&s;ian army. He, however, for &s;ome time, maintained his ground with
great firmne&s;s and re|&s;olution; and was at length unwillingly drawn from
the field, though he had received a wound which &s;oon after proved mortal, by
three repeated me&s;&s;ages from the king, commanding his im|mediate
attendance.</P>
<P>Mahummud Shaw was, with good rea&s;on, apprehen&s;ive that Nizam
ul muluck, who was then in the camp, was preparing to &s;eize him, which made
him &s;o anxious for the pre&s;ence of Dow|ran. When the wounded general
appeared before the king, he told him the &s;ituation of affairs, and
earne&s;tly intreated him to permit him to return to the field, with the troops
which were under his immediate command, as captain-general, con&s;i&s;ting of
36000 men, together with two hundred pieces of cannon. 
<Q REND="inline">"Grant my reque&s;t," &s;aid he, "and you
&s;hall never &s;ee me re|turn but in triumph."</Q></P>
<P>The king was now perplexed beyond mea&s;ure. He dreaded the
de&s;igns of the Nizam, &s;hould Dowran be ab&s;ent, and, at the &s;ame time,
he dur&s;t not permit the traitor to march out of the lines, for fear he
&s;hould join the Per&s;ians. He, therefore, fell into the common error of weak
minds, and he&s;itated, in hopes that delay would give birth to a more
favorable concurrence of events.&mdash;He was deceived: the happy moment, for
the pre&s;er|vation of him&s;elf and the empire, was now upon the wing. His
troops maintained &s;till their ground, under Muzziffer, the gallant brother of
Dowran; and a reinforcement would turn the &s;cale of victory in their
favor.</P>
<P> <PB N="17" REF="325"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>When Chan Dowran quitted the
field, the command of tho&s;e Moguls, who were engaged, devolved upon his

being &s;upported from the camp, Muzziffer, A&s;&s;il Ali Chan, Dowran's &s;on,
Raja Gugermull, Meer Mullu, Eadgar Chan, and twenty-&s;even officers of
di&s;tinction, covered one &s;mall &s;pot of ground with their bodies. Ten
thou&s;and common Mogul &s;oldiers were &s;lain in this de&s;perate action;
which had almo&s;t proved fatal to Nadir Shaw, for his whole army were upon the

<P>Chan Dowran, though wounded, had that night an interview with
the Nizam ul muluck. It was agreed, that the whole army &s;hould next morning
march out of the lines, and attack the Per|&s;ians in their camp. But when the
morning came, Chan Dow|ran's wound, which he had received in the arm, was &s;o
much inflamed, that he could not act, and, therefore, the meditated at|tack was
delayed. In the evening of the 18th, a mortification en&s;ued, which was then
attributed to &s;omething applied to the wound by a &s;urgeon bribed by the
Nizam; and many in India &s;till continue in the &s;ame belief.

&s;tood un|rivalled in the management of affairs. The whole authority de|volved
upon him, and the king became a cypher in the mid&s;t of his own camp. The
traitor finding now the power of the em|pire in his hands, under a certainty of
being able to di&s;po&s;e of the king at any time, according to his own
plea&s;ure, &s;et a treaty on foot with Nadir Shaw, for the immediate return of
that mo|narch into Per&s;ia. So little hopes had the Per&s;ian, at this time,
of conquering the Mogul empire, that he actually agreed for the pitiful &s;um
of fifty lacks of roupees to evacuate Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, who, we have already ob&s;erved, was in the
Per&s;ian camp, hearing of the&s;e tran&s;actions, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible
means to break off the treaty. The regard of Nadir Shaw to his plighted faith,
was not proof again&s;t the lucrative offers of Sadit. That Omrah promi&s;ed to
pay to the Per&s;ian two crores of roupees out of his own private fortune, upon
condition he &s;hould reduce the Nizam, and place him&s;elf at the head of the
admini&s;tration.&mdash;In the mean time, the Nizam, who was now appointed Amir
ul omrah, by Mahummud, finding that Nadir Shaw broke the treaty, began to talk
in a high &s;train, and to make preparations for coming to action with the
Per&s;ians, to which the king &s;tre|nuou&s;ly urged him. But the active
&s;pirit of Nadir Shaw was not idle during the&s;e tran&s;actions. He
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;everal &s;trong po&s;ts, round the Indian
camp, and totally cut off their &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. The Nizam
perceiving that he mu&s;t act with great di&s;advantage, if he &s;hould march
out of his lines and attack the Per&s;ians, began to renew the treaty, and
offered more than Sadit had done to Nadir Shaw.</P>

advanced a few &s;teps from his Mu&s;nid, and embraced Mahum|mud, and,
&s;itting down, placed him upon his left hand. The &s;ub&s;tance of their
conver&s;ation has been already given to the public by Fra&s;er: and,

<P>Nadir Shaw, after this conver&s;ation, retired to another tent,
called to him his vizier, and con&s;ulted with him what was be&s;t to be done
with Mahummud, in this critical &s;ituation. The vizier told him, that,
&s;hould he confine the king, the Nizam, who commanded the army, would
immediately act for him&s;elf; and, as he was an able officer, they might meet
with great diffi|culty in reducing him. But that, &s;hould the king be

Ca&s;im Beg was employed in this affair. He, in Nadir Shaw's name, made the
Nizam many prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, and obtained a promi&s;e, that he
would vi&s;it that monarch in his camp. He ac|cordingly, upon the 24th, &s;et

this time, &s;ecured mo&s;t of the Mogul omrahs, one after another, and when
Mahummud, upon the 26th, arrived in the camp, a tent was pitched for him near
the royal pavilion. The unfortunate Ma|hummud was carried into his tent, and

heartily; with|out betraying any &s;ymptoms of being affected with his unhappy

jewel-office.</NOTE> was e&s;timated at twenty-five crores, including the Tucht
Taoos, which alone co&s;t ten. The royal wardrobe and armory were valued at
five crores. Six crores were rai&s;ed in &s;pecie, by way of contribution, upon
the city, and about eight crores in jewels; all which, together with hor&s;es,
camels and elephants, amount to about fifty crores, or &s;ixty-two millions
five hundred thou&s;and pounds of our money.</P>
<P>Great cruelties were exerci&s;ed in levying the contributions
upon the city. Under an arbitrary government, like that of India, individuals
find it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal their wealth. Some Omrahs, therefore, who had
very little were taxed very high, whil&s;t others who were rich came off with a
moderate &s;um. Many of the former, under the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they
actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more wealth, were, after they had given all they
were <PB N="27" REF="335"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>worth in the world, tortured
to death; whil&s;t others, to avoid pain, &s;hame and poverty, put, with their
own hands, an end to their mi&s;erable exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Upon the 21&s;t of Mohirrim, the king of Per&s;ia celebrated the
nuptials of his &s;on, Mirza Na&s;ir Alli, with the daughter of Ezidan Buk&s;h,
the &s;on of Kaam Buk&s;h, and grand&s;on of the famous Aurungzebe. The Shaw
him&s;elf di&s;covered a violent de&s;ire to e&s;pou&s;e the beautiful daughter
of Muzi&s;&s;er Chan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brother of Chan Dowran. He was
&s;lain in the battle at Karnal.</NOTE>; but he was prevented by one of his
wives, who had the art to command the furious &s;pirit of Nadir Shaw, which the
re&s;t of the world could not controul.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e tran&s;actions the gates of the city were
kept &s;hut. Famine began to rage every day more and more; but the Shaw was
deaf to the mi&s;eries of mankind. The public &s;pirit of Tucki, a famous
actor, de&s;erves to be recorded upon this occa&s;ion. He exhibited a play
before Nadir Shaw, with which that monarch was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that he
commanded Tucki to a&s;k what he wi&s;hed &s;hould be done for him. Tucki fell
upon his face, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"O king, command the gates to be opened, that
the poor may not peri&s;h."</Q> His reque&s;t was granted, and half the city
poured out into the country; and the place was &s;upplied in a few days with
plenty of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The king of Per&s;ia, having now rai&s;ed all the money he could
in Delhi, rein&s;tated Mahummud Shaw in the empire, upon the third of Siffer,
with great &s;olemnity and pomp. He placed the crown upon his head with his own
hand, and pre&s;ented him with a rich chelat; di&s;tributing, at the &s;ame
time, forty more among the Mogul omrahs. He then gave to the emperor &s;ome
in|&s;tructions concerning the regulation of his army; to which he 
<PB N="28" REF="336"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>added &s;ome general maxims
of government. He put him upon his guard again&s;t the Nizam, who, he plainly
perceived, a&s;pired above the rank of a &s;ubject. 
<Q REND="inline">"Had not I," &s;aid the king of Per&s;ia,
"fooli&s;hly pa&s;&s;ed my word for his &s;afety, the old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nizam was near ninety years of age.</NOTE> traitor &s;hould
not now live to di&s;turb Mahummud."</Q></P>
<P>Every thing being ready upon the 7th, for Nadir Shaw's return to
Per&s;ia, &s;trict orders were i&s;&s;ued to his army to carry no &s;laves
away, nor any Indian women, contrary to their inclinations, upon pain of
immediate death. Before his departure, he obliged Mahummud formally to cede to
the crown of Per&s;ia, the pro|vinces of Cabul, Pe&s;hawir, Kandah&acirc;r,
Ghizni, Moultan and Sind, or, in general, all tho&s;e countries which lie to
the north-we&s;t of the Indus and Attoc. The whole of the trea&s;ure which
Nadir Shaw carried from Hindo&s;tan, amounted, by the be&s;t computa|tion, to
eighty millions of our money.</P>
<P>When this de&s;tructive comet, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of
our Indian author, rolled back from the meridian of Delhi, he burnt all the
towns and villages in his way to Lahore, and marked his rout with deva&s;tation
and death. 
<Q REND="inline">"But before he di&s;appears be|hind the
mountains of Per&s;ia," &s;ays our author, continuing the metaphor of the
comet, "it may not be improper to throw &s;ome light on the character of this
&s;courge of Hindo&s;tan."</Q> Nadir Shaw, together with great &s;trength of
body, was endued with uncommon force of mind. Innured to fatigue from his
youth, &s;truggling with dangers and difficulties, he acquired vigor from
oppo&s;ition, and a fortitude of &s;oul, unknown in a life of ea&s;e. His
ambition was unbounded and undi&s;gui&s;ed: he never fawned for power, but
demanded it as the property of his &s;uperior parts. Had he been born to a
throne, he de&s;erved it; had he conti|nued <PB N="29" REF="337"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>a &s;ubject, his glories
would have been le&s;s dazzling, but more permanent and pure.</P>
<P>In a country where patrioti&s;m and honor are principles little
known, fear is the only means to inforce obedience. This ren|dered Nadir Shaw
&s;o cruel and inexorable, that often, in his rage and the hurry of action, he
inflicted general puni&s;hments for the crimes of a few. Courage, which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in com|mon with the lion, was his only virtue; and he owed
his great|ne&s;s to the great defects of his mind. Had his eye melted at human
mi&s;eries, had his &s;oul &s;huddered at murder, had his brea&s;t glowed once
with benevolence, or, had his heart revolted at any inju&s;tice, he might have

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Conclu&s;ion of the Reign of MAHUMMUD
SHAW.</HEAD>
<P>THE king of Per&s;ia having evacuated Hindo&s;tan, the Nizam
began to di&s;cover his own ambitious de&s;igns. His rivals were now all
removed; &s;ome by his villainy, and others by favorable accidents. Without
oppo&s;ition, the management of affairs fell into his hands. Though he
ingro&s;&s;ed, in fact, the whole power, he delegated the great offices of
&s;tate to others. The name of vizier was retained by Kimmir ul Dien, and that
of Buck&s;hi, or captain-general, was conferred upon the Nizam's &s;on, Ghazi
ul Dien Chan. He appointed Emir Chan &s;ubad&acirc;r of Allahabad, which &s;o
di&s;gu&s;ted Mahomed Chan Bungui&s;h, to whom that government was promi&s;ed
by the former admini&s;tra|tion, that he left the court without leave, and
repaired to his Jagier at Ferochabad.</P>
<P>The government of Oud being vacant by the death of Sadit Chan,
that &s;uba&s;hip was conferred upon an Omrah, called Seifdar Jung, together
with the title of Burhan ul muluck. The Nizam, having nothing to fear from the
&s;ubas of the other provinces, continued them in their employs.
Notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere blow which the empire had ju&s;t received, no
mea&s;ures were taken to revive the declining power of the crown. This was, by
no means, the intere&s;t of the Nizam, who now a&s;&s;umed every thing of the
king, but the name.</P>
<P>Mahummud Shaw having &s;uffered him&s;elf to be dive&s;ted of
his power in his capital, it could not be expected that his autho|rity &s;hould
be much regarded in the provinces. The nabobs <PB N="31" REF="339"> and rajas,
throughout the empire, paid now little attention to the firm&acirc;ns of the
court of Delhi. Each of them entertained ideas of independence, and actually
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a regal authority in their governments.&mdash;The Mahrattors,
who had, for &s;ome time back, made large &s;trides to e&s;tabli&s;h the
ancient Hindoo government in India, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1740.</NOTE>in the year 1153, made an
incur&s;ion into the Carnatic with an army of eighty thou&s;and hor&s;e, under
the command of Ragojee. Having forced the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, they
fell unexpectedly upon Doo&s;t Ali, nabob of that province, in &s;ubor|dination
to the Nizam, who was governor-general of the Decan. The forces of Doo&s;t Ali
were defeated, and he him&s;elf, together with his &s;on, Ha&s;&s;in Ali, fell
in the action, after having exhibited extraordinary feats of bravery and
firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Sipadar Ali, the &s;on, and Chunder Saib, the &s;on-in-law of
Doo&s;t Ali, had &s;till con&s;iderable armies under their command. But both
having views upon the government of the province, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing the
Mahrattors, committed ho&s;tilities upon one another. The con&s;equence was,
that they were obliged to &s;hut them&s;elves up in places of &s;trength, the
fir&s;t in Velour, and the latter in Trichinopoly. The enemy were, by this
means, permitted to ravage the province at their lei&s;ure, and to rai&s;e
heavy contributions upon the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Sipadar Ali, finding he could effect nothing in the field
again&s;t the Mahrattors, &s;et a negotiation on foot with them, by the means
of his father's mini&s;ter, who had been taken pri&s;oner in the action by
tho&s;e barbarians. It was at la&s;t determined in private, that, upon
condition the Mahrattors &s;hould immediately evacuate the Carnatic, they
&s;hould receive one hundred lacks of roupees, at &s;tated periods; and that,
as a &s;ecurity for the payment of this &s;um, they &s;hould be put in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the territory of <PB N="32" REF="340"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1740.</NOTE>Trichinopoly. One of the
terms was, that Sipadar Ali-&s;hould be acknowledged nabob of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Ali, having thus &s;trengthened him&s;elf with the alliance of
the Mahrattors, his brother-in-law thought it prudent to pay him homage at
Arcot; not knowing that Trichinopoly, and tho&s;e di&s;tricts which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had been made over to the Mahrattors. The barbarians, in the
mean time, returned to their own domi|nions; but, about &s;ix months
thereafter, they made a &s;econd ir|ruption into the Carnatic, to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the territories which had been privately ceded to them by
Sipadar Ali. Chunder Saib &s;hut him&s;elf up in Trichinopoly; and after
&s;u&s;taining a &s;iege of three months, was, upon the &s;eventh of Mohirrim,
1154, obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e tran&s;actions in the Decan did not di&s;turb the peace
at Delhi. The king and his mini&s;ters continued in a profound lethargy ever
&s;ince the inva&s;ion of Nadir Shaw, and &s;eemed indifferent about the
affairs of the di&s;tant provinces. But a pre&s;&s;ing danger at home rou&s;ed
them for a moment. A fellow, from the low rank of a gra&s;s-cutter, rai&s;ed
him&s;elf to the command of a gang of rob|bers. As in the debilitated &s;tate
of government, he committed, for &s;ome time, his depredations with impunity,
his banditti, by degrees, &s;welled to an army of twelve thou&s;and men. He
im|mediately a&s;&s;umed the imperial en&s;igns, under the title of Daranti
Shaw. This mu&s;hroom of a king was, however, &s;oon de&s;troyed. Azim Alla, a
gallant Omrah, was &s;ent again&s;t him with an army from Delhi. He came up
with the rebels, cut the mo&s;t of them to pieces, and &s;lew Daranti in the
action. This happened in the 1153 of the Higera.</P>
<P> <PB N="33" REF="341"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>In the month of Regib, 1154,
Sipadar Ali, nabob of the Carnatic, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his
brother-in-law, Mortaz Ali, who immediately acceded to the Mu&s;nud. But a
general mutiny ari&s;ing in the army, the murderer was obliged to fly from his
capital, in a female dre&s;s; and Mahummud Chan, the &s;on of Sipadar, was
proclaimed &s;uba of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>The Nizam, who claimed the &s;overeignty of the Decan, &s;eeing
the&s;e repeated revolutions in the Carnatic, without his concurrence, began to
prepare to leave the court of Delhi. He &s;ettled his affairs with the
mini&s;try, and returned to Hydrabad. He imme|diately collected an army, and,
in the month of Ramzan, 1155, marched towards the Carnatic with near
three-hundred thou&s;and men. In the Si&s;&s;er of 1156, the Nizam arrived at
Arcot with|out oppo&s;ition; and found the country in &s;uch anarchy and
con|fu&s;ion, that no le&s;s than twenty petty chiefs had a&s;&s;umed the
titles of Nabob. The Nizam made a regulation, that whoever &s;hould take the
name of Nabob, for the future, without permi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be publickly
&s;courged; and rai&s;ed immediately Abdulla Chan, one of his own generals, to
the &s;uba&s;hip of Arcot; ordering the &s;on of Sipadar Ali into confinement.
He, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the city of Trichonopoly
by means of a &s;um of money which he gave to Malhar Raw, who commanded there
on the part of the Mahrattors.</P>
<P>The Nizam, without drawing the &s;word, thus &s;ettled the
affairs of the Carnatic. He returned in triumph to Golcondah, whither Abdulla
Chan, the new governor of Arcot, accompanied him. Abdulla, returning towards
his government, was, the fir&s;t night after his taking leave of the Nizam,
found dead in his bed; not without &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on from Anwar ul Dien
Chan, who &s;ucceeded him in the nabob&s;hip of Arcot, in the year 1157.</P>
<P> <PB N="34" REF="342"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>The Nizam in this ab&s;olute
manner di&s;po&s;ed of the provinces of the Decan, without the concurrence of
the court, and actually became king of that country, though he never
a&s;&s;umed that title. In the mean time, the Nizam's &s;on, Ghazi ul Dien
Chan, overawed Mahummud Shaw at Delhi, and left that indo|lent prince no more
than the mere &s;hadow of royalty.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Decan, that great limb of the Mogul empire, was cut
off by the Nizam, Aliverdi Chan u&s;urped the government of Bengal, Behar, and
Ori&s;&s;a. This fellow was once a common &s;oldier, who, together with his
brother Hamed, came from Tartary in que&s;t of &s;ervice to Delhi. In that city
they continued for &s;ome time in the &s;ervice of the famous Chan Dowran, and
afterwards became menial &s;ervants to Suja Chan, nabob of Cattack. Suja Chan,
after the death of Ja&s;&s;ier Chan, &s;ucceeded to the government of the three
provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Ori&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>The two Tartars, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good natural parts
and &s;ome education, ro&s;e gradually into office, and were greatly fa|vored
by the nabob. Hodjee Hamed had, in a manner, be|come his prime mini&s;ter, and,
by his political intrigues in the Haram, obtained the place of Naib, or deputy
of the province of Behar, for his brother Aliverdi, who was then a captain of
hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Aliverdi was not long e&s;tabli&s;hed in his high employ, when
he began to tamper with the venal mini&s;try of Delhi, for a &s;e|parate
commi&s;&s;ion for the province, which he then held of Suja Chan. Money, which
has great influence in every country, is all powerful in Hindo&s;tan. Aliverdi
&s;trengthened his &s;olicita|tions <PB N="35" REF="343"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>with a round &s;um, and, by
the means of Chan Dowran, became independent &s;uba of Behar.</P>
<P>Suja Chan dying &s;oon after, was &s;ucceeded in the
&s;uba&s;hip of Bengal by his &s;on Sirfaraz Chan. We do not mean to
in&s;inuate, that he had any right of inheritance to his father's government,
or that the &s;ubadary had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in his family by any grant of
the crown, which was contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the empire: but
the government was now &s;o weak, that the nabobs took upon them&s;elves to
bequeath their governments to their &s;ons, which were afterwards, through a
fatal nece&s;&s;ity, ge|nerally confirmed to them from Delhi.</P>
<P>Sirfaraz, being a man of a haughty and imperious
di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oon lo&s;t the affection of all his officers. He
di&s;graced Hodjee Hamed, and tarni&s;hed the honor of the powerful family of
Jagga Seat. Hamed, however, took advantage of the general di&s;affection to
Sirfaraz's government. He formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t the nabob, and
invited his brother Aliverdi to invade Bengal. Aliverdi accordingly marched
from Patna, in the month of Ramzan 1154, and entering Bengal, defeated and
killed Sir|faraz Chan, at Geriah, near Muxadabad, and, without further
oppo&s;ition, became &s;uba of the three provinces.</P>
<P>The weak emperor, in&s;tead of cha&s;ti&s;ing the u&s;urper with
an army from Delhi, fell upon an expedient, at once di&s;graceful and
impolitic. The Mahrattors threatened Mahummud for the Chout, which, before the
Per&s;ian inva&s;ion, he had promi&s;ed to pay them; and he gave them a
commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e it them&s;elves upon the revolted provinces. The
Suu<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suu, in the Shan&s;crita language, &s;ignifies
<HI>Glorious.</HI></NOTE> Raja, the chief of the Mahrattors, &s;ent accordingly
an army of 50000 hor&s;e, from <PB N="36" REF="344"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1742.</NOTE>his capital of Sattara, to
invade Bengal. This force, under the conduct of Bo&s;car Pundit, ravaged, with
fire and &s;word, all tho&s;e di&s;tricts which lie to the we&s;t of the
Ganges.</P>
<P>Aliverdi, who was a brave &s;oldier, defended him&s;elf with
great re&s;olution. But he owed more to his villainy than to his arms. Having
found means to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the leader of the Mahrattors, he forced them
to retreat.&mdash;When the news of this horrid murder reached the ears of the
Suu Raja, he ordered two other armies into Bengal; one by the way of Behar, and
another by that of Cattack. The fir&s;t was, commanded by Balla Raw, and the
latter by Ragojee.&mdash;Aliverdi, not being able to cope with this great force
in the field, had recour&s;e to art. He &s;owed di&s;|&s;ention between the two
chiefs; &s;et a private treaty on foot with Balla Raw; who, having received two
years Chout, evacuated the provinces, leaving his colleague to make the be&s;t
terms he could for him&s;elf. The &s;cale was now turned again&s;t the
Mahrattors. Ragojee retreated to Cattack, and, with con&s;tant incur&s;ions and
flying parties, greatly harra&s;&s;ed the provinces. The good fortune of
Aliverdi at length prevailed, and he &s;aw him&s;elf independent &s;overeign of
Bengal, Behar, and Ori&s;&s;a: though, to quiet the minds of the people, he
pretended to po&s;|&s;e&s;s grants from the court, which he him&s;elf had
actually forged.</P>
<P>We have been purpo&s;ely &s;uccinct on the manner in which the
Decan and Bengal were di&s;membered from the empire, as the facts are already
pretty well known in Europe. We re|turn, now, to, the affairs of the interior
provinces. This &s;ubject has hitherto been touched by no writer, and very few
Euro|peans in A&s;ia have made any con&s;iderable enquiries concern|ing it.</P>
<P> <PB N="37" REF="345"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1744.</NOTE>During the&s;e
tran&s;actions, nothing happened at Delhi, but the intrigues and factions of a
weak and corrupt admini&s;tration. In the year 1157, Ali Mahummud, a Patan of
the Rohilla tribe, Zemindar of Bangur, and Awla, began to appear in arms. Ali
was a &s;oldier of fortune, and a native of the mountains of Cabuli&s;tan, who,
&s;ome years before his rebellion, came to Delhi, with about three hundred
followers of his own tribe, and was entertained in the &s;ervice of Mahummud
Shaw. Being e&s;teemed a gallant officer, the command of a &s;mall di&s;trict,
upon the road between Delhi and Lahore, was conferred upon him; where he
entertained all vagrants of his own clan, who came down in que&s;t of military
&s;ervice, from their native mountains. In this man|ner Ali expended all the
rents of his di&s;trict, and he was hard pre&s;&s;ed for the payment of the
crown's proportion of his income, by the fogedar of Muradabad, to whom he was
accountable.</P>
<P>Hernind, the fogedar, de&s;pairing to get any part of the
re|venue from Ali Mahummud, by fair means, prepared to u&s;e force. He rai&s;ed
15000 of his own va&s;&s;als, with a de&s;ign to ex|pel or cha&s;ti&s;e the
refractory Zemindar. Ali, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his northern friends, who
lived upon him, defeated the fogedar, with great &s;laughter, and thus laid the
foundation of the Rohilla government, now &s;o formidable in Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, upon receiving intelligence at Delhi
of this blow to the regal authority, di&s;patched his own &s;on, Meer Munnu, a
youth of great bravery, with an army of 30000, again&s;t the rebels. Meer
Munnu, cro&s;&s;ing the Jumna, advanced to a place called Gurmuchti&s;her, on
the banks of the Ganges, and found that Ali Mahummud had acquired &s;o much
&s;trength &s;ince his late victory, that he feared the i&s;&s;ue of an
en|gagement. A negotialion, therefore, was &s;et on foot, and, after 
<PB N="38" REF="346"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1745.</NOTE>the armies had lain three
months in &s;ight of one another, a treaty was concluded. The conditions were,
that Ali Mahummud &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the countries, formerly
comprehended in the government of Hirnind, upon paying the ancient revenues to
the crown, and that, in the mean time, one year's payment &s;hould be advanced
in four months.</P>
<P>After this treaty was ratified, Meer Munnu returned to Delhi:
but the appointed time elap&s;ed, without any payments on the part of Ali
Mahummud. He continued to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, annexed more di&s;tricts to
his government, and ravaged the neighbouring countries to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his
army. He, in &s;hort, be|came formidable enough to rou&s;e the indolent
Mahummud Shaw from his lethargy. That monarch took the field, with fifty or
&s;ixty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and, in the year 1158, cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna.</P>
<P>Ali Mahummud, upon the king's approach, retreated acro&s;s the
Ganges, and &s;hut him&s;elf in Bangur, a place of &s;ome &s;trength, where the
imperial army inve&s;ted him. The rebel, for the fir&s;t two nights, made
&s;ucce&s;sful &s;allies, and killed many in the camp of Mahummud Shaw. The
king, however, having drawn lines of circumvallation round the fort, after a
&s;hort but bloody &s;iege, obliged the garri&s;on to capitulate. Ali made
terms for his own life, and he was brought pri&s;oner to Delhi, where he
remained in confinement for &s;ix months.</P>
<P>The Patan chiefs, who were always, in private, enemies to the
government of the Moguls, ca&s;ting their eyes upon Ali Mahum|mud, as a very
proper per&s;on to rai&s;e their own intere&s;t, &s;olicited the emperor for
his relea&s;e. The weak monarch granted their reque&s;t; but the Patans, not
yet &s;atisfied, obtained for Ali Ma|hummud <PB N="39" REF="347"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>the fogedar&s;hip of
Sirhind.&mdash;This was &s;uch wretched policy in the court of Delhi, that
nothing but downright infa|tuation, folly, and the la&s;t degree of corruption
in the mini&s;try, could ever have permitted it to take place. The
con&s;equence was, that Ali Mahummud collected his di&s;per&s;ed tribe, kept
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sirhind, of &s;everal di&s;tricts between the rivers and
beyond the Ganges, without remitting one roupee to court.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, that all the provinces to the
north-we&s;t of the Indus were ceded to Nadir Shaw. When that conqueror was
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in Per&s;ia, Achmet Abdalla, a native of Herat, who had
rai&s;ed him&s;elf in his &s;ervice, from the office of Chobdar, or
mace-bearer, to that of Chazanchi, or trea&s;urer, found means, with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his own tribe, in the confu&s;ion which &s;uc|ceded the
Shaw's death, to carry off three hundred camels loaded with wealth, to the
mountains of Afgani&s;tan. This trea&s;ure enabled Abdalla to rai&s;e an army,
and to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf by de|grees of the di&s;tricts of the mountains,
Herat, part of Chor|ra&s;&s;an, and all the provinces ceded by the crown of
Hindo&s;tan to the king of Per&s;ia. Thus Abdalla laid the foundation of an
empire, in tho&s;e countries, which formerly compo&s;ed the great monarchy of
Ghizni.</P>
<P>Achmet Abdalla, perceiving the declining &s;tate of the Mogul
government in Hindo&s;tan, cro&s;&s;ed the Attock, in the beginning of the year
1160, and rai&s;ing contributions upon his march, advanced towards Delhi, with
50000 hor&s;e. The poor Delhians were &s;truck with univer&s;al panic. The king
him&s;elf was &s;ick; and there were di&s;tractions in the councils of the
mini&s;ters. The pre&s;&s;ure of the danger cemented all their differences.
Ahmed Shaw, the prince royal, Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, Seid Sul|labit 
<PB N="40" REF="348"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>Chan, and Seifdar Jung, took
the field, with 80000 hor&s;e, and marched to oppo&s;e the invader.</P>
<P>The imperial army left Delhi upon the 18th of Si&s;&s;er, and
advanced to a place called Minoura, ten crores beyond Sirhind. Abdalla's army
were here in &s;ight; and both, afraid of the i&s;&s;ue of a battle, &s;trongly
entrenched them&s;elves. In this &s;ituation they remained for thirty days;
&s;ometimes &s;kirmi&s;hing, and at other times negotiating; but Ahmed Shaw
having no money to give, Abdalla would not retreat.</P>
<P>Abdalla, in the mean time, found means to advance &s;ome pieces
of artillery, which bore upon the flank of the imperial army. In the evening
the vizier, being at prayers, received a &s;hot in the knee, and died that
night. As he was very much e&s;teemed by the army, which in reality he
commanded, though the prince bore the name, it was propo&s;ed to Ahmed Shaw, by
Meer Munnu, the vizier's &s;on, to conceal his death, le&s;t the troops, who
depended upon his courage and capacity, &s;hould be affected by that accident.
The prince, &s;eeing the propriety of this mea&s;ure, called together a few of
his principal Omrahs, and held a council of war. It was re&s;olved, that the
body of the vizier &s;hould be mounted upon his own elephant, in the Howadar,
&s;upported with pillows; and that in the morning, by day-break, they &s;hould
i&s;&s;ue out of the camp and engage the enemy.</P>
<P>Orders were accordingly given that night to the Omrahs, to hold
their troops in readine&s;s, and their re&s;pective &s;tations ap|pointed to
each. In the morning, before day, the imperial army was in motion; but Abdalla,
having previous notice of their intentions, had prepared to receive them in his
camp. The young prince Ahmed led the attack with uncommon bravery, 
<PB N="41" REF="349"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>and was gallantly &s;econded
by Meer Munnu, who performed &s;urprizing feats of per&s;onal valour.&mdash;The
Per&s;ian defended him|&s;elf with equal re&s;olution, for the &s;pace of three
hours. At length, his entrenchments were trodden down by the elephants, and the
imperial army poured into his camp.</P>
<P>An unfortunate circum&s;tance, at this in&s;tant, totally
changed the face of affairs. I&s;&s;ur Singh, the &s;on of Joy&s;ingh, raja of
Amere, who commanded twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e, rode up to the vizier's
elephant for orders, and di&s;covered that he was dead. I&s;&s;ur Singh was
naturally a coward, and only wanted an excu&s;e to hide his head from danger.
He turned immediately his face from the field, and was followed by all his
troops. The flight of &s;o great a part of the army drew many after them,
parti|cularly Seifdar Jung, nabob of Oud. Abdalla not only recovered his troops
from their confu&s;ion, but pre&s;&s;ed hard upon the im|periali&s;ts in his
turn.</P>
<P>Meer Munnu, upon this urgent occa&s;ion, di&s;played all the
bravery of a young hero, together with all the conduct of an old general. He
formed in a column, and encouraging his troops, by words and example, bent his
whole force again&s;t Abdalla's center. He, at the &s;ame time, di&s;patched a
me&s;&s;enger to I&s;&s;ur Singh and Seifdar Jung, a&s;&s;uring them that
Abdalla was already defeated, and if they would return and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
the pur&s;uit, he would permit none of them ever to repa&s;s the Indus. The
&s;tratagem had the de&s;ired effect. They returned in full gallop to the
field, and re|newed the charge with great bravery.</P>
<P>Abdalla, having almo&s;t a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of the victory,
was, by this unexpected check, thrown into great confu&s;ion. Meer Munnu took
immediate advantage of the enemy's con&s;ternation, <PB N="42" REF="350"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>drove them off the field,
and pur&s;ued them five crores beyond their camp. The lo&s;s was nearly equal
on both &s;ides; but a compleat victory remained to the Moguls; for which they
were entirely indebted to the &s;urpri&s;ing efforts of Meer Munnu.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle defeat was not enough to di&s;courage Abdalla, who
was a brave officer. He collected his di&s;comfited army, di&s;|graced &s;ome
of his chief Omrahs, conferred their rank and honors upon others, rewarded
tho&s;e who had behaved well, and, with his &s;word drawn, riding through and
through his troops, encouraged them again to action. The Moguls were not a
little &s;urprized, next morning, to &s;ee Abdalla, whom they prepared to
pur&s;ue, with his army drawn up in order of battle before their
camp.&mdash;This uncommon confidence in a defeated enemy, threw a damp upon the
courage of the conquerors. They contented them&s;elves with forming the line,
and with &s;tanding in expecta|tion of the charge.&mdash;Abdalla, as the prince
had &s;ome advantage of ground, at the &s;ame time declined coming to action,
and, in the evening, encamped at a &s;mall di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day was &s;pent in &s;kirmi&s;hes, and a di&s;tant
can|nonade: but, upon the third, to u&s;e a Per&s;ian expre&s;&s;ion, the
interval of battle was clo&s;ed, and the &s;hock was very violent. Though
irregular armies of hor&s;e make little impre&s;&s;ion upon a &s;olid body of
well-di&s;ciplined infantry; yet when they engage one another, upon equal
terms, each tru&s;ts to the &s;trength of his own arm, and the battle is in
general extremely bloody. This irregular kind of attack, it mu&s;t be allowed,
requires a greater degree of per&s;onal courage, where man to man is oppo&s;ed,
than to &s;tand wedged in a clo&s;e battalion, where the danger may in|deed be
as great, but not &s;o apparent.</P>
<P> <PB N="43" REF="351"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>The young prince Ahmed
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a particular manner in this action; and Meer
Munnu, tenacious of the glory he had already acquired, was not to be
re&s;i&s;ted. Abdalla, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, was again driven
off the field, and pur|&s;ued acro&s;s the Suttuluz. Here Abdalla, in &s;pite
of his misfor|tunes, like an able and gallant commander, put the be&s;t face
upon his affairs. He had lo&s;t all his artillery and baggage, and being now
le&s;s incumbered than the imperial army, he made a forced march, and, taking a
circuit to the right, repa&s;&s;ed the river, and next day, to the
a&s;toni&s;hment of the prince and Meer Munnu, was heard off eighteen crores in
their rear, in full march towards Delhi.</P>
<P>Intelligence of Abdalla's march being received in the capital,
every thing fell into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and a general panic prevailed.
Ghazi ul Dien, the nizam's &s;on, being at court, collected what forces he
could, and marched out of the city to oppo&s;e Abdalla. The enemy hearing of
this army in their front, would proceed no further. His troops, with one voice,
told Abdalla, That, before they advanced towards Delhi, it was nece&s;&s;ary to
defeat the imperial army which was behind them. He was therefore con&s;trained
to march back towards the prince and Meer Munnu, who expected a third battle:
but Abdalla thought it prudent to decline it; and, by night, repa&s;&s;ed the
Moguls, and continued his rout to Lahore.</P>
<P>A change of affairs at the court of Delhi happening at this
time, prevented the prince and Meer Munnu from pur&s;uing Abdalla. They
encamped on the banks of the Suttuluz, where Ahmed Shaw propo&s;ed to confer
the &s;uba&s;hip of Lahore upon any of his Omrahs who would undertake to
recover it from Abdalla. After this offer had been declined by all of them, it 
<PB N="44" REF="352"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>was accepted upon the&s;e
terms by Meer Munnu; who, with a divi&s;ion of the army, marched towards
Lahore, while Ahmed Shaw returned with the re&s;t to Delhi. Mahummud Shaw had
an inviolable friend&s;hip for his vizier, Kimmir ul Dien Chan. In the
tottering &s;tate of the regal authority, all his confidence was repo&s;ed in
that mini&s;ter. When therefore the news of Kimmir's death came to him at
Delhi, he immediately con&s;idered his own affairs as de&s;perate. He retired
to a private apartment, and wept bitterly all night. In the morning he mounted
the throne as u&s;ual, to give public audience; and, whil&s;t every flat|tering
courtier was running out in prai&s;e of the decea&s;ed, the emperor &s;eemed
much affected. He, at la&s;t, exclaimed: 
<Q REND="inline">"O cruel fate! thus to break the &s;taff of my
old age.&mdash;Where now &s;hall I find &s;o faithful a
&s;ervant?"&mdash;</Q>With the&s;e words he fell into a fit, to which he was
&s;ometimes &s;ubject, and expired &s;itting upon his throne.</P>
<P>The death of Mahummud Shaw happened upon the 8th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the 1160 year of the Higera, after a di&s;a&s;trous reign of thirty
years. The court endeavored to conceal his death till his &s;on prince Ahmed
&s;hould arrive. He accordingly, upon the 7th day after his father's decea&s;e,
entered Delhi; being &s;ent for by expre&s;s from Ghazi ul Dien Chan, who was
&s;uppo&s;ed by the ignorant vulgar, who are always ready to a&s;cribe &s;udden
deaths to violence, to have made away with Mahummud Shaw.</P>
<P>MAHUMMUD SHAW was remarkably comely; of a &s;tately &s;tature
and affable deportment. He was no &s;mall proficient in the learning of his
country; and he wrote the Arabic and Per&s;ian languages with the greate&s;t
elegance and propriety. He was per&s;onally brave; but the ea&s;ine&s;s and
equality of his tem|per made his actions appear undeci&s;ive and irre&s;olute.
Good-natured <PB N="45" REF="353"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>to a fault, he forgave, in
others, crimes which his own &s;oul would abhor to commit; and thus he
permitted his autho|rity to become a victim to an ill-judged clemency.
Naturally indolent and diffident of his own abilities, his mind perpetually
fluctuated from one object to another. His pa&s;&s;ions therefore took no
determined cour&s;e of their own; but were ea&s;ily diverted into any channel,
by whatever per&s;on was near him.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;oul of Mahummud," &s;aid a Mogul who
knew him well, "was like the waters of a lake, ea&s;ily agitated by any
&s;torm, but which &s;ettle immediately after the winds are laid,"</Q> If his
ea&s;ine&s;s or irre&s;olution in politicks led him into many errors, he bore
with indifference, if not with &s;ortitude, the mi&s;fortunes which were their
natural con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Born in the &s;un&s;hine of a court, brought up in the bo&s;om
of luxury, confined within the walls of a zennana, and, in a man|ner, educated
among eunuchs, as effeminate as tho&s;e whom they guard, we are not to wonder
that the princes of the Ea&s;t &s;hould degenerate in a few generations. If to
the&s;e ob&s;tructions to the exertion of the manly faculties of the &s;oul, we
add the natural lenity of Mahummud, a common but unfortunate virtue in the race
of Timur, it ought not to &s;urprize us, that in a country like India, his
reign &s;hould be crowded with uncommon misfor|tunes. Had his fate placed
Mahummud in Europe, where e&s;tabli&s;hed laws &s;upply the want of parts in a
monarch, he might have &s;lumbered with reputation upon a throne; and left
behind him the character of a good, though not of a great, prince.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Hi&s;tory of the Reign of AHMED SHAW.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>UPON the 17th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the year 1160 of the Higera, AHMED SHAW, the &s;on of Mahummud,
mounted the throne of Delhi. The fir&s;t act of this reign, was the
ap|pointment of Seifdar Jung, the irre&s;olute &s;uba of Oud, to the vizarit.
This fellow was originally a merchant of Per&s;ia, known there by the name of
Abul Mun&s;ur. He travelled to India to &s;ell his commodities; and was
retained there as an accomptant, by the famous Sadit Chan, governor of Oud. He
behaved &s;o much to his ma&s;ter's &s;atisfaction in that &s;tation, that he
advanced him to a command in the army, and conferred upon him his daughter in
marriage. His alliance with Sadit &s;o much rai&s;ed his intere&s;t at the
court of Delhi, that, upon the death of his father-in-law, he was rai&s;ed to
the &s;uba&s;hip of Oud. Though he was a very bad &s;oldier, &s;uch was the
&s;moothne&s;s of his tongue and plau&s;ibility of behavior, that he pa&s;&s;ed
upon the weak as a man of con&s;iderable parts; which, together with &s;ome
know|ledge in the finances, paved his way to the high employ of vizier. Ghazi
ul Dien continued buk&s;hi; and no other material changes in the
admini&s;tration happened upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Ahmed.</P>
<P>The war with Abdalla, which was now carried on in Punjab by Meer
Munnu with various &s;ucce&s;s, ingro&s;&s;ed the attention of the court of
Delhi; for the greate&s;t part of the imperial army was employed in that
&s;ervice. Advices, in the mean time, arrived from the Decan, of the death of
the famous Nizam ul muluck, in the one hundred and fourth year of his age; and 
<PB N="47" REF="355"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>that his &s;econd &s;on,
Na&s;ir Jung, acceded to the government. It may not, perhaps, be out of place
here, to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of the character of the Nizam, who for a long
time made &s;o great a figure in India.</P>
<P>The Nizam, though no great warrior, was reckoned a con&s;um|mate
politician, in a country where low craft and deceit, with|out any principles of
honor and integrity, obtain the appellation of great parts. The dark de&s;igns
of his mind lay always con|cealed behind an uncommon plau&s;ibility and
eloquence of tongue. His pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o much under his command, that he
was never known to di&s;cover any violent emotion even upon the mo&s;t critical
and dangerous occa&s;ions: but this apathy did not ari&s;e from fortitude, but
from deep di&s;&s;imulation and de&s;igns. It was with him an unalterable maxim
to u&s;e &s;tratagem rather than force; and to bring about with private
treachery, what even could be accompli&s;hed with open force. He &s;o
habituated him|&s;elf to villainy, that the whole current of his &s;oul ran in
that channel; and it was even doubtful whether he could for a moment divert it
to hone&s;ty to bring about his mo&s;t favored de&s;igns. If the Nizam &s;hewed
any tendency to virtue, it was by &s;ub&s;tituting a le&s;&s;er wickedne&s;s
for a greater. When fraud and circumvention could accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e,
he never u&s;ed the dagger or bowl. To &s;um up his character in a few words;
without &s;hame, he was perfidious to all mankind; without remor&s;e, a traitor
to his king and country; and, without, terror, a hypocrite in the pre&s;ence of
his god.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Na&s;ir Jung, the nizam's &s;on, having
rebelled, was at the head of a great army. The deceitful old man counterfeited
&s;ickne&s;s &s;o well, and wrote &s;uch pathetic letters to Na&s;ir,
reque&s;ting to &s;ee him before he died, that the young fellow was taken in
the &s;nare, vi&s;ited his father, and was impri&s;oned.</NOTE></P>
<P> <PB N="48" REF="356"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1748.</NOTE>When the news of Nizam ul
muluck's death came to Delhi, Ghazi ul Dien, who was his elde&s;t &s;on,
applied to the king for his &s;uba&s;hip. But Na&s;ir Jung, being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his father's trea&s;ure, rai&s;ed a great army, and
marched from Aurungabad towards Delhi; not on pretence of war, but to pay his
re&s;pects to the emperor. Ahmed dreaded nothing more than this cere|monious
vi&s;it from a man at the head of &s;o great a force. He judged that Na&s;ir
Jung, under that &s;pecious pretext, covered a de&s;ign to extort from him a
confirmation of the &s;ubadary of the Decan. He therefore dur&s;t not favor the
preten&s;ions of Ghazi to the provinces of the Decan, and con&s;equently was
reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of confirming Na&s;ir Jung in his u&s;urpation.
Thus the &s;torm was diverted, and the new Nizam returned to Aurungabad.</P>
<P>In the year 1161, Caim Chan Bungui&s;h, jagierd&acirc;r of
Feroch|abad, having differed with Ali Mahummud, a neighbouring Zemindar, they
both drew out their va&s;&s;als and dependents, and fought about ten crores
above Ferochabad, and Caim Chan was defeated and &s;lain. Seifdar Jung, the
vizier, being informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;ent orders to Raja Nevil
Roy, his deputy in the province of Oud, to confi&s;cate the e&s;tate of Caim
Chan. The deputy rigorou&s;ly executed the vizier's orders. He &s;eized upon
Caim Chan's five &s;ons, together with five of his adopted &s;laves, confined,
and afterwards a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated them at Allahabad. Ahmed Chan, another
&s;on of Caim Chan, remained &s;till alive; and, in order to revenge the death
of his brothers, rai&s;ed the Patan tribe, of which he was now acknowledged
chief, and marched again&s;t Nevil Roy, who had collected all his forces to
oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P> <PB N="49" REF="357"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1748.</NOTE>In the beginning of the year
1162, the two armies met at a place near Lucknow, called Callinuddi. The Patans
were &s;carcely four thou&s;and &s;trong; but the army of the deputy of Oud
con&s;i&s;ted of at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and. The Patan chief, in&s;pired by
revenge, and vigorou&s;ly &s;upported by his friends, attacked in per&s;on
Nevil Roy in the very center of his army, and &s;lew his enemy with his own
hand. The army of Nevil Roy, &s;eeing him fall, immediately quitted the field.
Their artillery and baggage, and &s;oon after almo&s;t the whole province of
Oud, fell into the victor's hands.</P>
<P>When the news of this di&s;a&s;ter arrived at Delhi, Seifdar
Jung, the vizier, talked in a very high &s;train, and reque&s;ted of the
emperor, that he might be permitted to lead an army again&s;t Ahmed Chan. The
&s;ultan con&s;ented; but the &s;ea&s;on being far &s;pent before the army was
levied, the expedition was deferred till the &s;ol&s;titial rains &s;hould be
over. In the month of Mohirrim, 1163, the vizier, with an army of eighty
thou&s;and men, marched from Delhi; and, without di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex,
or condition, put all the Patans he could find to the &s;word. Ahmed Chan was
not intimidated by this great force. With &s;carce twelve thou&s;and men he
marched from Ferochabad, and met the imperiali&s;ts at Shuru Sahawir, near that
city.</P>
<P>The day happened to be very windy, and Ahmed improved that
circum&s;tance to his own advantage. He wheeled to windward, and the du&s;t
flew in &s;uch clouds in the face of the imperial army, that they did not
di&s;cover the motions of Ahmed; but a&s;cribed the darkne&s;s which involved
them&s;elves to the effects of a whirlwind, common at that &s;ea&s;on of the
year. The enemy, however, like a thunderbolt, i&s;&s;ued from the bo&s;om of
this &s;torm, and at once &s;truck the Moguls with terror and di&s;may. 
<PB N="50" REF="358"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1749.</NOTE>The Patans made &s;uch good
u&s;e of their &s;words, that they &s;oon covered the field with dead; and the
cowardly Seifdar Jung, without making one effort, was the fir&s;t of his army
who fled. The Jates and Rohillas, though thus &s;hamefully de&s;erted by their
general, made head again&s;t Ahmed Chan, and found means to carry off the
greate&s;t part of the artillery, which con&s;i&s;ted of twelve hundred pieces
of various bores. But neither of tho&s;e tribes returned the guns to the king:
they carried them to their own forts, to &s;trengthen them&s;elves again&s;t
his authority.</P>
<P>This overthrow was a dreadful &s;troke to the tottering empire.
The greate&s;t part of the province of Oud was lo&s;t; the Jates, a numerous
tribe of Hindoos, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large territory near Agra; and the
Rohillas, a Patan nation, who inhabited the greate&s;t part of the country
between Delhi and Lucknow, &s;eeing the whole imperial force baffled by a petty
chief, began to throw off their allegiance. Seifdar Jung, in the mean time,
arrived with a &s;mall part of his army at Delhi; and Ghazi Chan advi&s;ed the
king to put him to death for the di&s;grace which he had drawn upon his arms.
This puni&s;hment would not have been too &s;evere for the vizier's bad
behaviour: but that mini&s;ter had &s;trengthened his intere&s;t by a coalition
with Juneid Chan, the chief eunuch.</P>
<P>The queen-mother, Begum Kud&s;ia, being a woman of gal|lantry,
had, for want of a better lover, fixed her affection upon the chief eunuch. She
had the addre&s;s to direct the weak monarch in every thing, and to keep him in
leading-&s;trings upon the throne. Juneid Chan, though in no public employ, by
means of Kud&s;ia's favor, held the helm of government; and, by his influence,
not only &s;aved the vizier's life, but continued him in his office.</P>
<P> <PB N="51" REF="359"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1750.</NOTE>In the cour&s;e of the
&s;ame year, a treaty was concluded with the Mahrattors, who were &s;preading,
their deva&s;tations over the &s;outhern provinces. The Chout was &s;tipulated
to be regularly paid by the empire to tho&s;e trouble&s;ome barbarians. Ahmed
Shaw ordered an army to be levied, to recover the province of Oud; and it was
&s;oon compleated by the acce&s;&s;ion of forty thou|&s;and Mahrattors, who
inlifted them&s;elves in the imperial &s;ervice. But in&s;tead of putting
him&s;elf at the head of his forces, the weak emperor, by the advice of his
mother and her gallant, gave the command of it to his vizier, that he might
have an opportunity to retrieve his lo&s;t honour.</P>
<P>Raja Sourage Mull, prince of the Jates, by the acqui&s;ition of
the Mahrattors to the imperial army, judged it prudent once more to join the
vizier with all his forces; &s;o that the mini&s;ter's army now con&s;i&s;ted
of no le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and men. Seifdar Jung marched from Delhi,
in the year 1164, again&s;t Ahmed Chan: but the Raja of the Jates, in&s;tead of
aiding him, found means to fru&s;trate all his de&s;igns. Having &s;pent a
whole campaign without coming to action, he patched up a very di&s;honorable
peace, and returned to Delhi with the Mahrattor mercenaries at his heels,
mutinous for want of their pay.</P>
<P>The demand of the Mahrattors amounted to fifty lacks of roupees,
which the government was in no condition to pay: and the &s;um gradually
increa&s;ed with the delay. Ghazi ul Dien, who had been for &s;ome time
&s;oliciting for a royal commi&s;&s;ion for the &s;uba&s;hip of the Decan,
promi&s;ed to pay off the Mahrattor debt, upon condition he &s;hould receive
from the emperor that appointment. Ahmed Shaw was glad upon any terms to pet
rid of tho&s;e clamorous and dangerous mercenaries, and accordingly i&s;&s;ued
out the imperial &s;unnuds to Ghazi. That Omrah having <PB N="52" REF="360"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1751.</NOTE>&s;atisfied the Mahrattors
in their demands upon Ahmed, engaged them immediately in his own &s;ervice; and
having added to them a great army of either troops, obtained his own office of
buck&s;hi for his &s;on Ghazi, a youth of fifteen years of age, and marched
towards the Decan.</P>
<P>The elder Ghazi's brother, Na&s;ir Jung, &s;uba of the Decan,
and his &s;on Muziffer, who had &s;ucceeded him in the government, were both
dead. Sillabut Jung, the third &s;on of the old Nizam, now &s;at upon the
Mu&s;nud, which Ghazi claimed by the right of primogeniture. In the month of
Zehidge, 1165, he, with an army of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and men,
arrived in the environs of Aurungabad. The forces of his brother, Sillabut
Jung, the reigning &s;uba, were &s;omewhat inferior in number, but they were
&s;trengthened by a body of French mercenaries, which, in all probability,
would in&s;ure to him the victory. Sillabut Jung, however, was afraid of the
i&s;&s;ue of a general battle; and, after &s;ome &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes, he
found means to prevail with his uncle's wife to take off his competitor with
poi&s;on. Thus did the perfidious Sillabut Jung &s;ecure to him&s;elf the
empire of the Decan, without a rival.</P>
<P>But to return to the tran&s;actions of the court of Delhi:
Seifdar Jung, the vizier, finding that his own influence declined, and that
Juneid Chan, the favorite eunuch, carried all before him, invited him to an
entertainment, and, contrary to the laws of ho&s;pitality, and altogether
forgetful that he owed to Juneid his own life and fortune, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated
him by the hands of I&s;hmaiel Chan, one of his adopted &s;laves. Ahmed Shaw,
being informed of this pre&s;umptuous villainy, flew into a violent rage,
degraded Seifdar Jung from the vizarit, and bani&s;hed him the court. This was
the effect of a &s;it of pa&s;&s;ion; for the unfortunate king was 
<PB N="53" REF="361"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1751.</NOTE>in no condition, in fact, to
exert &s;o far his authority. The per|fidious vizier, finding that he had
nothing to hope from &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, broke out into open rebellion. He
&s;oon after, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Jates, advanced to Delhi, and
be&s;ieged Ahmed Shaw and young Ghazi, the buck&s;hi, in that city.</P>
<P>The &s;on of Kimmir ul Dien, who, in the reign of Mahummud, held
&s;o long the vizarit, was rai&s;ed, under the title of Chan Chanan, to the
vacant employ of Seifdar Jung, and began to &s;hew &s;ome abilities in his new
office. Young Ghazi, who was a youth of extraordinary parts, defended the city
with great re&s;o|lution for three months. The rebels were at la&s;t &s;o
di&s;pirited, that Ghazi ventured to attack them in the field, and gained a
complete victory. Seifdar Jung fled towards his former &s;uba&s;hip of Oud, and
left his allies, the Jates, under Raja Sourage Mull, to extricate them&s;elves
from the perilous &s;ituation to which he had brought them.</P>
<P>The rebellion of Seifdar happened in the year 1166. The Jates
being de&s;erted by him, were in no condition to keep the field again&s;t
Ghazi. They fled before the imperial army under Akebut Chan, to their own
territories near Agra. That general inve&s;ted the &s;trong fortre&s;s of
Billemgur, which he took by capi|tulation; but &s;o little did he regard his
plighted faith to the gar|ri&s;on, that he put them all to the &s;word. The
Jates, in the mean time, came before the imperial army; but diffident of their
own &s;trength in the field, they &s;eparated their forces, and &s;hut
them&s;elves up in their forts. The imperial general al&s;o divided his army
into detachments, and laid at once &s;iege to the two &s;trong forts of Dieg
and Combere, lying in the territory between Agra and Delhi.</P>
<P> <PB N="54" REF="362"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1752.</NOTE>Ghazi ul Dien, in the mean
time, to carry on more effectually the war again&s;t the Jates, obtained
permi&s;&s;ion from the emperor, to call in forty thou&s;and Mahrattors, under
their two chiefs, Jeiapa Malhar Raw, and Raganut Raw. By this acqui&s;ition of
&s;trength, the imperiali&s;ts were enabled to carry on the &s;ieges with
vigor. At Delhi, young Ghazi and the new vizier con|tended for the command of
the army. This conte&s;t was after|wards fatal in its con&s;equences; but for
the pre&s;ent Ghazi ul Dien prevailed. He marched with a reinforcement from
Delhi; and, upon his arrival in the country of the Jates, took the com|mand of
the imperial army.</P>
<P>The &s;ieges continued two months after the arrival of Ghazi;
and the garri&s;ons were reduced to the la&s;t extremities. The
im|periali&s;ts, in the mean time, had expended all their ammunition; and Ghazi
was, upon that account, obliged to di&s;patch Akebut Mahmood to Delhi, with a
good force, to bring him the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores. The vizier &s;eeing that
the &s;trong holds of the Jates mu&s;t &s;oon fall into the hands of Ghazi,
&s;hould he be &s;upplied with ammunition, and being extremely jealous of any
thing that might throw honor upon his rival, poi&s;oned the mind of the weak
king again&s;t his buck&s;hi, by means of forged letters and villainous
in&s;inuations, that the young Omrah a&s;pired to the throne. The enterprizing
genius, and great abilities of Ghazi, gave &s;ome color to &s;u&s;picions of
that kind; and the unfortunate Ahmed, in|&s;tead of promoting his own cau&s;e
again&s;t the Jates, took every mea&s;ure to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of
Ghazi.</P>
<P>The king accordingly begun to levy forces in Delhi, and wrote a
letter to Raja Sourage Mull, the chief of the Jates, to make an ob&s;tinate
defence, and that he him&s;elf would &s;oon relieve him: that, under pretence
of joining the army under Ghazi, he would <PB N="55" REF="363"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1752.</NOTE>attack that general in the
rear, and at the &s;ame time di&s;play a &s;ignal to the Raja, to &s;ally from
the fort of Combere.&mdash;Thus the king, as if infatuated by his evil genius,
planned his own ruin. His letter fell into the hands of Ghazi, who&s;e friends
at court had informed him of the intrigues of the vizier. Struck with the
king's ingratitude, and urged on by &s;elf-defence, he immediately re&s;olved
upon open ho&s;tility. He rai&s;ed the &s;ieges, and cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna, to
oppo&s;e Ahmed Shaw and his vizier, who were marching down between the
rivers.</P>
<P>The king, hearing of Ghazi's approach, halted at Secundra, and
endeavoured, by fair promi&s;es, to bring back that Omrah to his duty. Ghazi,
in an&s;wer to the king's me&s;&s;age, returned to him his own letter to Raja
Sourage Mull. He wrote him, at the &s;ame time, that 
<Q REND="inline">"he could place no confidence in a man, who
plotted again&s;t his life, for no crime; if to &s;erve the &s;tate was not
one. What mercy," continued Ghazi, "can I ex|pect from Ahmed, in the days of
rebellion, when he treated me as a traitor, in the days of loyalty and
friend&s;hip? A prince, that is weak enough to li&s;ten to the ba&s;e
in&s;inuations of every &s;ycophant, is unworthy to rule over brave men; who,
by the laws of God and nature, are ju&s;tified to u&s;e the power which
providence has placed in their hands, to protect them&s;elves from
inju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P>The king perceived, by the &s;train of this letter, that Ghazi
was re&s;olved to pu&s;h him to the la&s;t extremity. He, however, dur&s;t not
engage him in the field. He made the be&s;t of his way to Delhi, and was &s;o
clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by Ghazi, that that Omrah po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of
one of the gates; upon which Ahmed Shaw and the vizier &s;hut them&s;elves up,
with a &s;mall party, in the citadel. Ghazi immediately inve&s;ted the place;
and the <PB N="56" REF="364"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>king, after a faint
re&s;i&s;tance, &s;urrendered him&s;elf. Ghazi, after reproaching him for his
intentions again&s;t his life, committed him and the vizier to the charge of
Akebut Mahmood. The unfortunate &s;ultan was deprived of &s;ight, the next day,
by the means of an hot iron. It is &s;aid, by &s;ome, that this was done by
Akebut Mahmood, without orders, to &s;hew his zeal for the &s;er|vice of his
patron; but, from the general character of Ghazi, we have no rea&s;on to doubt
his being concerned in this crime.</P>
<P>Thus ended the reign of the unfortunate Ahmed Shaw: a prince,
who, in his fir&s;t exploits, appeared with &s;ome lu&s;tre. When he mounted
the throne, as if action degraded royalty, he altogether gave him&s;elf up to
indolence. To &s;ave the trouble of thinking, he became the dupe of every
&s;pecious flat|terer, and at la&s;t fell the unlamented victim of his own
folly. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the clemency of the hou&s;e of Timur; but that
virtue was now, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a vice, in a country &s;o corrupt, and in
an age &s;o degenerate. Though Ahmed was not defective in per&s;onal courage,
he may truly be &s;aid to be a coward in mind: dangers appeared formidable to
him, through a troubled imagi|nation, which, upon trial, he had fortitude to
&s;urmount.&mdash;He &s;at upon the throne of Delhi &s;even lunar years and one
month; and was depo&s;ed in the month of Jemmad ul awil, in the 1167 of the
Higera.</P>
<P>The power and extent of the empire were very much dimi|ni&s;hed
in the reign of Ahmed Shaw. All the provinces, except tho&s;e between the
frontiers of the Jates, a few miles to the ea&s;t of Delhi, and Lahore to the
we&s;t, were, in fact, di&s;membered from the government of the hou&s;e of
Timur, though they paid a nominal allegiance. The rich kingdom of Guzerat was
divided between the Mahrattors and a Patan tribe, called Babb&eacute;; the 
<PB N="57" REF="365"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>Decan was u&s;urped by the
Nizam ul muluck's family; Bengal, Behar, and Ori&s;&s;a, by Aliverdi Chan, and
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; Oud, by Seifdar Jung; Doab, by Ahmed Chan Bungui&s;h;
Allahabad, by Mahummud Kuli; and the countries round Agra, by Raja Sourage
Mull, the chief of the Jates.&mdash;Budaoon, and all the provinces to the north
of Delhi, were in the hands of Mahum|mud Ali, Sadulla Chan, and other chiefs of
the Rohilla tribe of Patans. A number of petty Rajas &s;tarted up into
independent princes in Malava: Bucht Singh &s;eized upon the exten&s;ive
ter|ritory of Marw&acirc;r, and Madoo Singh reigned in the provinces round
Joinagur and Amere.</P>
<P>The gallant Meer Munnu &s;till oppo&s;ed the torrent of
inva&s;ion from the north. He maintained the war with &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t
Abdalla, for the provinces of Moultan and Punjab, and, for a &s;hort &s;pace of
time, &s;upported the declining empire. Every petty chief, in the mean time, by
counterfeited grants from Delhi, laid claim to jagiers and to di&s;tricts: the
country was torn to pieces by civil wars, and groaned under every &s;pecies of
dome&s;tic confu&s;ion. Villainy was practi&s;ed in every form; all law and
religion were trodden under foot; the bands of private friend|&s;hips and
connections, as well as of &s;ociety and government, were broken; and every
individual, as if amid&s;t a fore&s;t of wild bea&s;ts, could rely upon nothing
but the &s;trength of his own arm.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Hi&s;tory of the Reign of ALLUMGIRE
SANI.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1753.</NOTE>UPON the &s;ame day that
Ahmed Shaw was deprived of &s;ight, Ghazi ul Dien relea&s;ed from confinement
Eaz ul Dien, the &s;on of Moaz ul Dien, and grand&s;on of Bahadar Shaw, the
&s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the famous Aurungzebe. This prince was placed by
Ghazi upon the throne, by the name of ALLUM|GIRE. To begin his reign with an
act of beneficence, he ordered &s;eventeen per&s;ons of the imperial hou&s;e of
Timur to be relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, to grace his coronation. It may not be
improper here to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the inauguration of the Mogul
emperors.</P>
<P>When a prince is, for the fir&s;t time, &s;eated upon the
throne, with the royal umbrella over his head, the Omrahs, according to their
dignity, are ranged in two lines before, one upon his right, the other to his
left hand. A herald then proclaims his titles; and the Omrahs, each in his
&s;tation, advance with an offer|ing in gold, which he him&s;elf receives from
their hands. The &s;uperintendant of the kitchen brings then a golden &s;alver,
with bread, confections, and other eatables, over which the king, joined by the
whole court, repeats a form of grace; and then he eats a little, and
di&s;tributes the remainder, with his own hand, among the nobility. This latter
is an ancient Mogul ceremony, introduced by the family of Timur. The emperor
mounts then his &s;tate-elephant, and, attended by all the court, moves
&s;lowly towards the great Mu&s;gid, throwing, as he advances, gold, &s;ilver,
precious &s;tones, and pearls, among the populace. In the Mu&s;gid he repeats a
prayer, and afterwards divine &s;ervice is performed by <PB N="59" REF="367"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>the Sidder ul
&s;udd&ucirc;r, or the metropolitan of Delhi. The Chutba, or the genealogy and
titles of the king, are then read, and he re|turns to the palace with the
&s;ame magnificence and pomp. The Mogul emperors are never crowned: but upon
&s;ome fe&s;tivals they &s;it in &s;tate, under a large golden crown, which is
&s;u&s;pended by a chain to the roof of the pre&s;ence-chamber, and &s;erves
the purpo&s;e of a canopy.</P>
<P>Allumgire found him&s;elf as much a pri&s;oner upon the throne,
as he was formerly in his confinement. He was not a man of parts &s;ufficient
to extricate him&s;elf from the toils of that power, to which he owed his
advancement; but had he made no efforts to acquire &s;ome authority, the empire
might have been, perhaps, re&s;tored to its original dignity and &s;plendor, by
the very extraor|dinary abilities of Ghazi ul Dien.&mdash;That Omrah now
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the office of the vizarit. Allumgire, without the capacity of
guiding the operations of government him&s;elf, began to turn all his mean
parts to thwart the &s;chemes of the vizier. Without con&s;idering whether the
mea&s;ure was right or wrong, it was &s;uf|ficient that it came from the
vizier, for the emperor to oppo&s;e it by his minions.</P>
<P>This aver&s;ion in the king to Ghazi, did not long e&s;cape the
penetrating eyes of that young Omrah. He knew that he was &s;urrounded by many
enemies, and therefore was unwilling to re&s;ign an employ, from which he
derived protection to his own per&s;on. In the mean time all bu&s;ine&s;s was
&s;u&s;pended, and the two factions, like armies afraid of the i&s;&s;ue of a
battle, watched the motions of one another.&mdash;Nothing remarkable happened
at Delhi, during the fir&s;t year of Allumgire, but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
of the former vizier, about &s;ix months after his impri&s;onment, by the
orders of Ghazi ul Dien.</P>
<P> <PB N="60" REF="368"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1754.</NOTE>But, in the cour&s;e of this
year, the empire received a &s;evere blow on its frontiers, by the death of the
gallant Meer Munnu, by a fall from his hor&s;e. He had, in many engagements,
de|feated Abdalla, and recovered from him the whole province of Lahore. No
&s;ooner was this brave Omrah dead, than Abdalla re|conquered all he had
lo&s;t; and, advancing to Lahore, confirmed his &s;on, then an infant, in the
government of that place, under the direction of an experienced Omrah.</P>
<P>The great &s;ucce&s;s of Abdalla, in the north-we&s;t, began to
rou&s;e the court of Delhi. It was at la&s;t re&s;olved, that Ali Gohar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent emperor.</NOTE>, Allumgire's elde&s;t &s;on,
&s;hould, in conjunction with Ghazi ul Dien, the vizier, march with the
imperial army again&s;t the Per&s;ians. The trea&s;ury was now empty; and the
few provinces, &s;ubject to the empire, were grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed for
money to rai&s;e a force for this expedition.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1169, the imperial army,
con|&s;i&s;ting of 80000 men, under the prince and young Ghazi, took the field.
They advanced to a place called Matchiwarra, about twenty crores beyond
Sirhind. They found Abdalla &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in his new conque&s;ts,
that they thought it prudent to proceed no further. The whole campaign
pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ettling a treaty of marriage, between the vizier and the
daughter of Meer Munnu. It &s;eems that Omrah, to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t
at the court of Delhi, had, before his death, promi&s;ed his daughter to Ghazi;
but, after that event, both the young lady and her mother were extremely
aver&s;e to the match. When the imperial army lay at Matchiwarra, the vizier
inveigled both the ladies from Lahore to the camp, and finding all intreaty was
in vain to obtain their con&s;ent, he, with peculiar ba&s;ene&s;s, clo&s;ely
confined them, to intimidate them into a compliance. This together with
op|pre&s;&s;ing <PB N="61" REF="369"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1755.</NOTE>the provinces, through which
he marched, comprehended the whole exploits of Ghazi on this expedition. After
&s;pending all the public money in this vain parade, the prince and vizier,
without &s;triking a blow, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this inaction of the vizier proceeded from
ad|vices which he daily received from court. The king and his faction gained
&s;trength during his ab&s;ence; and he fore&s;aw his own ruin, in ca&s;e he
&s;hould meet with a defeat from Abdalla. Upon his return to Delhi, he found it
nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;upport his declining authority, to act with great
rigor and tyranny. Some Omrahs he removed with the dagger, and others he
deprived of their e&s;tates. He confined the king in the citadel, and did
what&s;oever he plea&s;ed, as if he him&s;elf was ve&s;ted with the regal
dignity.</P>
<P>Allumgire, finding him&s;elf in this di&s;agreeable &s;ituation,
adopted a very dangerous plan to extricate him&s;elf. He wrote privately to
Abdalla, to advance with his army, to relieve him from the hands of his
treacherous vizier. He promi&s;ed, that upon his arrival on the environs of
Delhi, he &s;hould be joined by the bulk of the imperial army, under the
command of Nigib ul Dowla, a Rohilla chief, to whom Ghazi had delegated his own
office of buck&s;hi, when he ro&s;e to the employ of vizier. Thus the weak
Allumgire, to avoid one evil, plunged headlong into greater misfortunes.</P>
<P>Abdalla, having received the&s;e a&s;&s;urances from the king,
marched from Cabul, where he then kept his court, entered Hindo&s;tan with a
great army, and, in the year 1171, appeared before Delhi. The vizier marched
out with the imperial forces to give him battle; but, in the field he was
de&s;erted by his <PB N="62" REF="370"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1757.</NOTE>friend, Nigib ul Dowla, with
the greate&s;t part of his army. The ignorance of Ghazi ul Dien of a plot &s;o
long carried on, is a great proof of his extreme unpopularity. The
con&s;equence was, that Ghazi was obliged to throw him&s;elf upon the clemency
of Abdalla, who had &s;worn vengeance again&s;t him, &s;hould he ever fall into
his hands. But &s;uch was the addre&s;s of the vizier, that he not only found
means to mollify the Per&s;ian, but even to make him his friend. He was,
however, at fir&s;t turned out of his office, but he was &s;oon after
re&s;tored by Abdalla him&s;elf, who now di&s;po&s;ed of every thing, as if he
was ab&s;olute king of Delhi.</P>
<P>Abdalla entered the city, and laid the unfortunate inhabitants
under a contribution of a crore of roupees; a &s;um now more difficult to
rai&s;e than ten crores, in the days of Nadir Shaw. The Per&s;ian remained two
months in Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire, not only found that his capital was
robbed, but that he him&s;elf was delivered over again into the hands of a
per&s;on, who had now added re&s;entment to ambition and power.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian, after the&s;e tran&s;actions, took the prince,
Hedad Bux&s;h, brother to the pre&s;ent emperor, as ho&s;tage for Allumgire's
future behavior; and, having forced Meer Munnu's daughter to &s;olemnize her
marriage with Ghazi, marched towards Agra. He, on his way, laid &s;iege to
Muttra, took it by a&s;&s;ault; and, having &s;acked the place, put the
inhabitants to the &s;word, for the enormous crime of attempting to defend
their lives and pro|perty. After this &s;cene of barbarity, Abdalla advanced to
Agra, which was held on the part of the king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the
Jates had all the country round Agra, they had not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of that city.</NOTE> by Fazil Chan. This Omrah defended the city
with &s;uch re&s;olution, that Abdalla, <PB N="63" REF="371"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1757.</NOTE>after &s;u&s;taining &s;ome
lo&s;s, thought it prudent to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but, being exa&s;perated at
this repul&s;e, he &s;pread death and de|va&s;tation through the territories of
the Jates, who, unable to cope with him in the field, had retired into their
&s;trong holds; from which, they at times i&s;&s;ued, and cut off his
&s;traggling parties.&mdash;The Per&s;ian returned to a place called Muxadabad,
about eight crores from Delhi. Allumgire came out to pay his re&s;pects to him;
and, by his conduct, &s;eems to have been per|fectly infatuated. When the cries
of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people reached heaven, that contemptible monarch,
in&s;tead of endeavoring to alleviate their mi&s;eries, either by force or
negotiation, was wholly bent on the gratification of a &s;en&s;ual appetite.
The cau&s;e of his vi&s;it to Abdalla, was to obtain his influence and
mediation with Sahibe Zimany, the daughter of Mahummud Shaw, whom he wanted to
e&s;pou&s;e; the prince&s;s her&s;elf being aver&s;e to the match. When kings,
in&s;tead of exerting their talents for the protection of their people,
&s;uffer them&s;elves to be ab&s;orbed in indolence and &s;en&s;uality,
rebellion becomes patrioti&s;m, and trea&s;on it&s;elf is a virtue.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the news of &s;ome incur&s;ions from the
we&s;t|ern Per&s;ia, into the territories of Abdalla, recalled that prince from
India. Mallek&eacute; Jehan, the widow of Mahummud Shaw, and her daughter
Sahibe Zimany, claimed his protection again&s;t Allumgire. He carried them both
to Cabul, and &s;ome time after e&s;pou&s;ed the daughter him&s;elf.&mdash;The
Per&s;ian having evacuated the imperial provinces, the vizier became more cruel
and oppre&s;|&s;ive than ever: he extorted money from the poor by tortures, and
confi&s;cated the e&s;tates of the nobility, upon fal&s;e or very frivolous
pretences. To the&s;e tyrannies he was no le&s;s driven by the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;upporting an army to inforce his authority, than he was by the natural
avidity and cruelty of his own unprincipled mind.</P>
<P> <PB N="64" REF="372"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1758.</NOTE>The king and his elde&s;t
&s;on, Ali Gohar, were, in the mean time, kept &s;tate pri&s;oners. The latter
made his e&s;cape in the year 1172, and levying &s;ix thou&s;and men at Rowari,
began to rai&s;e the revenues of the adjacent territories. After he had
continued this vagrant kind of life for nine months, the vizier, by the means
of in&s;idious letters, in which Ittul Raw, chief of the Mahrattors, Raja
Dewali Singh, Raja Nagor Mull, and many other Omrahs, &s;wore to protect him,
inveigled him to Delhi. But, in violation of all oaths and fair promi&s;es, he
was in&s;tantly confined by Ghazi, in the hou&s;e of Alla Murda Chan, where he
remained for the &s;pace of two months.</P>
<P>The vizier having received intelligence that the prince was
privately attaching &s;ome Omrahs to his intere&s;t, and fearing that, by their
means, he might again make his e&s;cape, determined to remove him to the
citadel. He ordered a detachment of five hundred hor&s;e to execute this
&s;ervice. The prince not only refu&s;ed to comply with the vizier's orders for
his removal, but ordered the gates of the hou&s;e to be &s;hut, and, with a few
friends, betook him&s;elf to arms. The hou&s;es of the nobility in Hindo&s;tan
are &s;urrounded by &s;trong walls; and, in fact, are a kind of &s;mall forts.
The vizier's troops found it therefore extremely difficult to reduce the
prince. He was be&s;ieged clo&s;ely for two days; and, finding that he could
not defend him&s;elf much longer from the thou&s;ands that &s;urrounded the
hou&s;e, he formed the gallant re&s;olution to cut his way through the
enemy.</P>
<P>He imparted his intentions to his friends, but they &s;hrunk
from his propo&s;al as impracticable. At la&s;t, &s;ix of them, &s;eeing him
re&s;olved to attempt this de&s;perate undertaking alone, pro|mi&s;ed to
accompany him. On the morning of the third day, <PB N="65" REF="373"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1758.</NOTE>they mounted their hor&s;es
within the court. The gate was &s;uddenly thrown open, and they i&s;&s;ued
forth &s;word in hand, with the prince at their head. He cut his way through
thou&s;ands of Ghazi's troops, with only the lo&s;s of one of his gallant
follow|ers. Raja Ramnat, and Seid Ali, were the two principal men concerned in
this extraordinary exploit; the other four being common hor&s;emen. Seid Ali
was wounded, but four and the prince e&s;caped without any hurt.</P>
<P>The prince having thus forced his way through the vizier's army,
i&s;&s;ued out of the city, and arrived at a place, called Vizierabad, about
&s;ix crores from the &s;uburbs. Ittul Raw, the Mahrattor chief, lay encamped
with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e at Vizier|abad. Ittul had been hired as a mercenary
by the vizier, to &s;up|port him in his tyrannical proceedings: but re&s;enting
Ghazi's breach of promi&s;e to the prince, and not being regularly paid, he now
thought of plundering the country under the &s;anction of Ali Gohar's name. He
received him, therefore, with very great re&s;pect, and promi&s;ed to &s;upport
him.</P>
<P>The prince, and Ittul Raw, accordingly continued, for the
&s;pace of &s;ix months, to rai&s;e contributions on the provinces to the
&s;outh of Delhi: but as the petty chiefs of villages had, during the
confu&s;ions of the empire, con&s;tructed mud forts, whither they retired with
their families and effects, at the approach of danger, the Mahrattors found
great difficulty in &s;upporting them&s;elves, as none of tho&s;e forts could
be reduced without a regular &s;iege, in which they were very little &s;killed.
Ittul Raw, tired of this kind of unprofitable war, propo&s;ed to the prince to
retire to Guali&ecirc;r, where the Mahrattors had now e&s;tabli&s;hed a
government, promi&s;ing to give him a tract of country for his maintenance. 
<PB N="66" REF="374"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1759.</NOTE>Ali Gohar thanked the
Mahrattor for his generous propo&s;al, but declined to accept of it.</P>
<P>His eyes were now turned to another quarter. Nigib ul Dowla, who
had, at the king's reque&s;t, betrayed Ghazi ul Dien to Ab|dalla, was, upon the
rein&s;tatement of the vizier in his office, obliged to fly to his jagier of
Secundra, between the rivers, about forty crores below Delhi. The prince looked
upon him as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to conduct his affairs. He accord|ingly
took leave of Ittul Raw, cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna, arrived at Secundra, and was
received with great re&s;pect by Nigib ul Dowla, who, however, did not think
proper to join heartily in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To return to the tran&s;actions at Delhi: Ahmet Abdalla had no
&s;ooner &s;ettled his affairs, than he prepared for an|other expedition into
Hindo&s;tan. He re&s;olved to &s;upport his army with the plunder of that
country, and to keep them in action there for other enterprizes more arduous.
He accordingly marched from Candahar, and, in the month of Ribbi ul awil, 1174,
arrived in the environs of Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire applied to him for
relief; and, if po&s;&s;ible, exaggerated his own mi&s;fortunes, and the
unheard of villainies of his vizier. He, at the &s;ame time, by his
emi&s;&s;aries, &s;tirred up factions in the army of Ghazi, who had marched out
of the city to give battle to Abdalla. The di&s;cerning mind of that mini&s;ter
&s;oon penetrated into the king's machinations again&s;t him. He did not for a
moment he&s;itate what to do; his hands had already been imbrued in blood, and
he &s;tarted not at murder. He re&s;olved to take off the king, and then to let
future events direct his line of action.</P>
<P> <PB N="67" REF="375"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1760.</NOTE>Though the king was in &s;ome
mea&s;ure a pri&s;oner, he was permitted to keep his guards and a great retinue
of &s;er|vants. They pitied his misfortunes, and became firmly attached to his
intere&s;t. Abdalla, who was near with his army, &s;eemed to give &s;ome
encouragement to Allumgire, and that prince's party acquired &s;trength every
day. The vizier &s;aw him&s;elf hemmed in upon all &s;ides by enemies; he,
therefore, thought it high time to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his ma&s;ter.&mdash;He
knew the weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition of the mind of Allumgire. He,
therefore, trumped up a &s;tory concerning a Fakier, who prophe&s;ied and
wrought miracles at the Kottulah of Fero&s;e Shaw. The poor enthu&s;ia&s;tic
king, ju&s;t as Ghazi expected, expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the
holy Fakier. As it would derogate from the reputation of the pretended &s;aint,
to pay a vi&s;it, even to a king; Allumgire re&s;olved to confer upon him that
piece of re&s;pect.&mdash;But he had no &s;ooner entered the apartment where
the holy impo&s;tor &s;at, than two a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;tarted from behind a
curtain, cut off his head with a &s;cimiter, and threw his body, out of a back
window, upon the &s;ands of the Jumna. It lay there two days without interment;
none daring to pay the la&s;t office to the remains of their unfor|tunate king.
This tragedy was acted at Delhi, in the month of Ribbi ul Sani, 1174.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Allumgire, who, in an age of peace and
tranquillity, might have lived with &s;ome reputation, and have died with the
character of a &s;aint. But the times required uncommon abilities in a king,
and the mo&s;t vigorous exertion of the manly faculties of the &s;oul; neither
of which that unhappy monarch in any degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His &s;truggles,
therefore, again&s;t the ambition of Ghazi, were puerile and impotent. Had he
employed the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in again&s;t the brea&s;t of that treacherous
mini|&s;ter, ju&s;tice would have warranted the blow; had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed 
<PB N="68" REF="376"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1760.</NOTE>courage to have aimed it with
his own hand, a thou&s;and oppor|tunities were not wanting. What then can be
&s;aid in favor of a man, who dur&s;t not make one manly effort for his
authority, or re&s;ent indignities which he daily received in per&s;on?</P>
<P>The perfidious vizier ordered the body of the king, after lying
two days expo&s;ed on the &s;and of the Jumna, to be privately interred. He
then took another prince of the blood, and placed him upon the throne, by the
name of Shaw Jehan.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Tran&s;actions at the Court of Delhi, from the
Death of ALLUMGIRE SANI, to the pre&s;ent Times.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>NIGIB UL DOWLA, who had,
&s;ome time before the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Allumgire, made up matters with
the vizier, had the addre&s;s to retain the office of buck&s;hi. Shocked at the
villainy of Ghazi, or de&s;irous to transfer to him&s;elf the whole power, he
again betrayed that mini&s;ter, and went over with all his forces to Abdalla.
Ghazi, in con&s;equence of this de&s;ertion, found him&s;elf obliged al&s;o to
make peace with the invader.</P>
<P>The&s;e factions proved fatal to the unhappy Delhians. Abdalla
laid the city under heavy contributions, and inforced the col|lection with
&s;uch rigor and cruelty, that the unfortunate inhabi|tants, driven to
de&s;pair, took up arms. The Per&s;ian ordered a general ma&s;&s;acre, which,
without intermi&s;&s;ion, la&s;ted for &s;even days. The relentle&s;s
Durannies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tribe, of which Abdalla is the chief, are
di&s;tingui&s;hed by that name.</NOTE> were not even then glutted with
&s;laughter, but the &s;tench of the dead bodies drove them out of the city. A
great part of the buildings were, at the &s;ame time, reduced to a&s;hes, and
many thou&s;ands, who had e&s;caped the &s;word, &s;uffered a lingering death
by famine, &s;itting upon the &s;moaking ruins of their own hou&s;es. Thus the
imperial city of Delhi, which, in the days of its glory, extended it&s;elf
&s;even|teen crores in length, and was &s;aid to contain two millions of
people, became almo&s;t a heap of rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P> <PB N="70" REF="378"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>The mi&s;eries of the
unfortunate Delhians were not yet at an end. The Mahrattors, who now, without
intermi&s;&s;ion, traver&s;ed the empire for plunder, advanced to partake of
the &s;poils of Delhi with Abdalla. Jincow and Malharraw, accordingly, occupied
the environs of the city. The Per&s;ian marched but again&s;t them, and both
armies joined battle at a place called Mudgenu Tuckia, two crores from the
depopulated capital. The Mahrattors were defeated, and pur&s;ued one hundred
and fifty crores from the field: but they, in the mean time, gave Abdalla the
&s;lip, turned his rear, and &s;et out in full march for Delhi. The Durannies,
however, were &s;o clo&s;e to their heels, that, before they could attempt any
thing again&s;t the city, they were a &s;econd time obliged to retreat.</P>
<P>In the mean time news arrived, that the Mahrattor chiefs were
advancing with another very numerous army from the Decan, with a profe&s;&s;ed
de&s;ign to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the ancient Hindoo government. Bi&s;&s;wa&s;s Raw,
Baow, and Ibrahim Chan Ghardi, commanded this force, which, independent of the
army of Mahrattors, whom Abdalla had already defeated, con&s;i&s;ted of one
hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e. The Mahommedans were &s;truck with terror; they
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to join Abdalla, to &s;upport the faith: Suja ul
Dowlat, who had &s;ucceeded his father, the infamous Seifdar Jung, in the
province of Oud, Ahmed Chan Bungui&s;h, chief of the Patans and all the petty
chieftains of the Rohillas, ha&s;tened with their forces to Delhi.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors had now entered the territories of the Jates, and
&s;ummoned Raja Sourage Mull to join them. Though Sourage Mull, as a Hindoo,
wi&s;hed for the extirpation of Mahommedi&s;m in India, he was too jealous of
the power of the Mahrattors, to obey their orders. Enraged at his ob&s;tinacy, 
<PB N="71" REF="379"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>they carried fire and
&s;word through his dominions, com|pelled him at la&s;t to join them with fifty
thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The Maharattors now con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred thou&s;and
hor&s;e, and the Mahommedans, whom Ahmet Abdalla commanded in chief, of near
one hundred and fifty thou&s;and. The eyes of all India were now turned towards
the event of a war, upon which depended, whether the &s;upreme power &s;hould
remain with the Mahommedans, or revert again to the Hindoos. Upon the approach
of the Mahrattors, Abdalla evacuated Delhi, and, having cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna,
encamped on the oppo&s;ite bank.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors immediately entered the city, and filled every
quarter of it with deva&s;tation and death. Not content with robbing the
mi&s;erable remains of Abdalla's cruelty of every thing they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
they &s;tripped all the males and females quite naked, and wantonly whipped
them before them along the &s;treets. Many now prayed for death, as the
greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and thanked the hand which inflicted the
wound.&mdash;Famine begun to rage among the unfortunate citizens to &s;uch a
degree, that men fled from their deare&s;t friends, as from bea&s;ts of prey,
for fear of being devoured. Many women devoured their own children, while
&s;ome mothers, of more humanity, were &s;een dead in the &s;treets, with
infants &s;till &s;ucking at their brea&s;ts.&mdash;But let us now draw a veil
over this &s;cene of horror.</P>
<P>Ghazi ul Dien found, by this time, that Abdalla was become his
enemy, and inclined to the intere&s;ts of Nigib ul Dowla. He therefore
endeavoured to make up matters with the Mahrattors, but his propo&s;als were
rejected. He then turned him&s;elf to the Raja of the Jates, who was in the
field an unwilling auxiliary to the Mahrattors, and per&s;uaded him to de&s;ert
their cau&s;e, and <PB N="72" REF="380"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>retire to his own country,
whither he him&s;elf accompanied him. Thus ended the public tran&s;actions of
Ghazi ul Dien, who crowded into a few years of early youth more crimes and
abilities, than other con&s;ummate villains have done into a long life of
wickedne&s;s and treachery. Though he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the Decan, the
fruits of his grandfather's uncommon crimes, he may truly be &s;aid to have
been the genuine heir of the parts and trea&s;ons of that mon&s;ter of iniquity
and villainy.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors, when they entered Delhi, confined Shaw Jehan,
who had borne the title of royalty for a few weeks; and, to quiet the minds of
&s;ome Mahommedan omrahs, who aided them, rai&s;ed to the throne Jewan Bucht,
the elde&s;t &s;on of prince Ali Gohar, who had by this time a&s;&s;umed the
title of Shaw Allum in Behar. But this young prince, had he even abilities to
reign, had now no &s;ubjects left to command; for he may be con&s;idered as the
image of a king, &s;et up by way of in&s;ult in the mid&s;t of the ruins of his
capital.</P>
<P>Abdalla being informed of the de&s;ertion of the Jates, was
extremely de&s;irous of repa&s;&s;ing the Jumna, and to come to battle with the
Mahrattors. He, for this purpo&s;e, marched up along the bank oppo&s;ite to the
enemy, to Kungipurra, a place of &s;ome &s;trength, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
Nizabat Chan, an independent Rohilla chief. The Per&s;ian &s;ummoned him to
&s;urrender, which he refu&s;ed, and the place was con&s;equently taken by
a&s;&s;ault, and the garri&s;on and inhabitants put to the &s;word.&mdash;The
Mahrattors, at the &s;ame time, marched up upon the &s;ide of Delhi, and, too
confident of their own &s;trength, permitted Abdalla, without oppo&s;ition, to
cro&s;s the Jumna, by the ford of Ramra: but ob&s;erving him more bold in his
motions than they expected, they became &s;omewhat afraid, and intrenched
them&s;elves at <PB N="73" REF="381"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>Karn&acirc;l, in the very
&s;ame ground which was occupied formerly by Mahummud Shaw, while Abdalla
cho&s;e the more fortunate &s;ituation of Nadir Shaw.</P>
<P>Both armies lay in their entrenchments, for twelve days,
&s;kirmi&s;hing at times with &s;mall parties. Abdalla, in the mean time, found
means to cut off &s;ome Mahrattor convoys, with pro|vi&s;ions, and, by the
vigilance and activity of his Durannies, to prevent all &s;upplies from coming
to the enemy's camp.&mdash;As famine began to rage among the Mahrattors, they
were nece&s;&s;i|tated to march out of their lines, upon the 20th of Jemmad ul
Sani, 1174, and to offer battle to Abdalla, which he immediately accepted. The
fir&s;t &s;hock was extremely violent: the Mah|rattors advanced with great
re&s;olution, and charged Abdalla &s;word in hand with &s;uch vigor, that he
was upon the point of being driven off the field, when Suja ul Dowlat, well
known to the Briti&s;h in India, and Ahmed Chan Bungui&s;h, the Patan chief of
Doab, fell upon the flank of the Mahrattors, with ten thou&s;and
hor&s;e.&mdash;This circum&s;tance immediately turned the &s;cale of victory.
Abdalla recovered from his confu&s;ion, renewed the charge, and drove back the
enemy. Should we credit common report, fifty thou|&s;and Mahrattors fell in
this action, and in the pur&s;uit: but be that as it will, the battle was
extremely bloody, for all the ge|nerals of the vanqui&s;hed, excepting Malhar
Raw, who fled upon the fir&s;t charge, were &s;lain.</P>
<P>Abdalla, after having pur&s;ued the Mahrattors for the &s;pace
of three days, returned to Delhi. He wrote from thence letters to prince Ali
Gohar, who had proclaimed him&s;elf king in the pro|vince of Behar, under the
title of Shaw Allum, reque&s;ting him to return to Delhi, and to take upon him
the management of the affairs of government. Shaw Allum was too prudent to 
<PB N="74" REF="382"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>tru&s;t him&s;elf in the
hands of Abdalla, and therefore that prince, who&s;e affairs on the &s;ide of
Per&s;ia required his pre&s;ence, confirmed Jewan Bucht<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent emperor's elde&s;t &s;on.</NOTE> upon the throne of
Delhi, under the tuition of Nigib ul Dowla, from whom he exacted an annual
tribute. Abdalla, after the&s;e tran&s;actions, returned to Cabul.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Abdalla evacuated Delhi, than the Jates
com|menced ho&s;tilities again&s;t Nigib ul Dowla. They &s;eized upon Camgar
Chan, Zemind&acirc;r of Ferochagur, and appropriated to them&s;elves his wealth
and territory. The mini&s;ter, upon this, took the field. The Jates advanced
again&s;t him, with a great army, under the conduct of their chief, Raja
Sourage Mull. The Jates being much &s;uperior to the force of Nigib ul Dowla,
became confident of &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that, when the armies approached within a
few miles of one another, near Secundra, the Raja went carele&s;sly out, with
&s;ome of his officers, upon a hunting party. Nigib ul Dowla, being informed of
this circum&s;tance by means of his &s;pies, immediately detached a party of
five hundred hor&s;e, under Seidu, a bold partizan, in que&s;t of the Raja.</P>
<P>Seidu fell in with Sourage Mull, who&s;e party con&s;i&s;ted of
about three hundred. They engaged &s;word in hand, with great re&s;olution on
both &s;ides; but, at length, the Jates were cut off to a man, and the Raja's
head was brought to Nigib ul Dowla, who was then upon his march to attack the
enemy. The unex|pected appearance of Nigib, in the ab&s;ence of their prince
and be&s;t officers, &s;truck the Jates with univer&s;al panic; when, at that
very in&s;tant, a hor&s;eman advancing at full &s;peed, threw the Raja's head
into their line. This circum&s;tance compleated their confu&s;ion, &s;o that
Nigib ul Dowla defeated them with ea&s;e, and pur&s;ued them, &s;word in hand,
&s;ome crores from the field of battle.</P>
<P> <PB N="75" REF="83"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1762.</NOTE>The mini&s;ter, after this
victory, returned to Delhi. But he had not long remained in that capital,
before Joahir Singh, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Sourage Mull, hired
twenty thou&s;and Mah|rattors, under Malhar Raw, and advanced with all his
forces to Delhi. Nigib ul Dowla was not capable to cope with the Jates and
their auxiliaries in the field. He &s;hut him&s;elf up in the city, where he
was be&s;ieged for three months, and at la&s;t reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s.
However, a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent to Malhar Raw &s;aved him upon this critical
occa&s;ion. The Jates, finding them|&s;elves betrayed by their mercenaries,
were obliged to patch up a peace, and retire into their own country. The&s;e
tran&s;actions happened in the year 1175 of the Higera. Nigib ul Dowla has been
&s;ince frequently attacked by the Jates to the ea&s;t, and the Seiks to the
we&s;t, but he &s;till maintains his ground with great re&s;olution and
ability.</P>
<P>But to return to the adventures of the prince Ali Gohar, who,
under the title of emperor, now reigns in the &s;mall pro|vince of Allahabad:
we have already ob&s;erved, that he, after parting with the Mahrattors, threw
him&s;elf upon Nigib ul Dowla at Secundra. He could not, however, prevail upon
that Omrah to take up arms in his favor, He, therefore, left Secundra, with a
&s;mall retinue of &s;ervants, who lived at their own expence, in hopes of
better days, with their prince. With the&s;e he arrived at Lucknow, one of the
principal cities of the province of Oud, where Suja ul Dowlat kept then his
court. Suja ul Dowlat re|ceived the king with &s;eeming great re&s;pect, and
paid him royal honors; but this was only the fal&s;e politene&s;s of an Indian
court; which is always le&s;s deficient in ceremony than in &s;aith. It was not
the intere&s;t of Suja ul Dowlat, who, by the villainies of his father, the
infamous Seifdar Jung, had become an independent prince, to revive the power of
the empire, he therefore declined <PB N="76" REF="384"> all connection with the
affairs of Ali Gohar. He, how|ever, made him a Na&s;ir of &s;ome elephants,
hor&s;es, and half a lack of roupees in money, and in&s;inuated to him, to
leave his court.</P>
<P>Ali Gohar, in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, turned towards
Alla|habad. Mahummud Kuli Chan, at that time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that city and
province. Mahummud received the prince with friend|&s;hip as well as re&s;pect;
for being a man of an enterprizing ge|nius, he entertained great hopes of
rai&s;ing him&s;elf with the for|tunes of the Shaw Zadda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw Zadda literally &s;ignifies the king's &s;on: a title by
which Ali Gohar was di&s;tingui&s;hed during the life of his father Allumgire
Sani.</NOTE>. After maturely deliberating upon the plan of their future
operations, it was re&s;olved, that, in&s;tead of relieving the unfortunate
Allumgire from the tyranny of Ghazi at Delhi, they &s;hould endeavor to
po&s;&s;e&s;&s; them&s;elves of the provinces of Bengal and Behar, the revenues
of which might enable them to &s;upport a &s;ufficient army to re&s;tore the
power of the empire. Though the Shaw Zadda was the undoubted heir of the
empire, yet, to take away every pretence of right from Jaffier Ali Chan, whom
the Briti&s;h, on account of his villainies, had rai&s;ed to the government of
Bengal, he obtained a private grant of the &s;uba&s;hips of the three provinces
from his father at Delhi.</P>
<P>Every thing being now concerted, public orders were i&s;&s;ued
to the neighbouring rajas and &s;ogedars, to repair to the &s;tandard of the
Shaw Zadda; while Mahummud Kuli Chan rai&s;ed all the troops of Allahabad.
Camgar Chan, one of the principal foge|dars of Behar, Pulwan Singh, raja of
Budgepoor, Bulbidder, raja of Amati, and many other, both Hindoo and Mahomedan 
<PB N="77" REF="385"> chiefs, obeyed the &s;ummons, and joined the prince.
Soldiers of fortune, in the mean time, &s;tocked to him from all quarters, &s;o
that Ali Gohar found him&s;elf &s;oon at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and
men.</P>
<P>In the month of Ribbi ul Sani, of the year 1173, the Shaw Zadda
marched from Allahabad towards Bengal. The parti|culars of this war are well
known. Let it &s;uffice to mention here, that the prince was un&s;ucce&s;sful
in all his attempts upon Bengal; and was, at la&s;t, obliged to &s;urrender
him&s;elf to the commander of the Briti&s;h forces, at Geiah in Behar. He
re|ceived intelligence, &s;oon after, of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his
father at Delhi. He was accordingly proclaimed emperor at Patna; but nothing
being done for him, by the Briti&s;h, the unfortunate prince found him&s;elf
obliged to throw him&s;elf into the hands of Suja ul Dowlat, who, in the
ab&s;ence of Kuli Chan, had &s;eized upon the province of Allahabad. The
villainy of Suja ul Dow|lat did not re&s;t there: he invited Kuli Chan to a
conference, and ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him.</P>
<P>Suja ul Dowlat, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the king's
per&s;on, clo&s;ely confined him. He, at the &s;ame time, mocked the un|happy
man with a farce of royalty, and obliged him to ratify all grants and
commi&s;&s;ions, which might &s;erve his own purpo&s;es. Under the &s;anction
of the&s;e extorted deeds, Suja ul Dowlat made war upon the neighboring
&s;tates, in which, however, he was not very &s;ucce&s;sful. When Ca&s;&s;im
Ali Chan was driven from the &s;uba&s;hip of Bengal, Suja ul Dowlat joined him,
in order to re|cover his government. He was defeated at Buxar, by the

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Of the pre&s;ent State of HINDOSTAN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1764.</NOTE>THE &s;hort &s;ketch which
we have given in the preceding &s;ections, of the Hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan, may
&s;erve to throw light on the decline of the great empire of the Moguls in that
part of the world. We &s;aw it gradually &s;hrinking into it&s;elf, till the
race of Timur are, at la&s;t, confined within the narrow limits of an
in&s;ignificant province. It mu&s;t, however, be al|lowed, that the uncommon
mi&s;fortunes of that family, proceeded no le&s;s from their own weakne&s;s,
than from the villainy of their &s;ervants. Had a man of parts &s;ucceeded the
debility of Mahum|mud Shaw's government, the ancient glory of the empire might
have been &s;till re&s;tored. The revolted &s;ubas were not, then, well
e&s;tabli&s;hed in their independence; and the gallant re&s;i&s;tance which
Abdalla met with, in the reign of Ahmed, &s;hewed that the Moguls could &s;till
defend them&s;elves from foreign inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>This, like other great &s;tates, fell into pieces, more by
do|me&s;tic factions, than by foreign arms. Even the mini&s;ters of the
unfortunate Mahummud were men of parts; tho&s;e who ma|naged the affairs of
Ahmed were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great abilities; and, in the reign of Allumgire
Sani, young Ghazi di&s;played an uncommon and enterprizing genius. But virtue
had fled from the land: no principle of honor, patrioti&s;m, or loyalty,
remained; great abilities produced nothing but great crimes; and the eyes of
individuals being wholly intent upon private advantage, the affairs of the
public fell into ruin and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P> <PB N="80" REF="388"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1764.</NOTE>As from the ruins of the
exten&s;ive empire of the Moguls, many independent governments have &s;tarted
up of late years, it may not be improper, in this place, to take a cur&s;ory
view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Hindo&s;tan. To begin with the northern
provinces. We have already ob&s;erved, that Candahar, Cabul, Ghizni,
Pi&s;hawir, with a part of Moultan and Sind, are under the dominion of Ahmet
Abdalla. That prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es al&s;o, upon the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, the
greate&s;t part of Chorra&s;&s;&acirc;n and Sei&s;tan, and all Bamia, on that
of Tartary. Abdalla, in &s;hort, reigns over almo&s;t all the countries which,
formed the empire of Ghizni, before it de&s;cended from the moun|tains of
Afgani&s;t&acirc;n to Lahore and Delhi. It is highly pro|bable that, as Kerim
Chan has &s;ettled the we&s;tern Per&s;ia, he may &s;oon extend the empire to
its ancient boundaries towards the ea&s;t, and drive Abdalla into Hindo&s;tan;
&s;o that a third dyna&s;ty of kings of India may ari&s;e from among the
Afgans.</P>
<P>The revenues of Abdalla are very con&s;iderable, amounting to
about three crores of roupees. But as he is always in the field, and maintains
an army of 100,000 hor&s;e, to defend him&s;elf from the Per&s;ians and
Tartars, he is in great di&s;tre&s;s for money. This circum&s;tance obliges
him, not only to oppre&s;s his own &s;ub|jects, but al&s;o to carry his
depredations to foreign countries. During the competition of the &s;even
con&s;pirators for the throne of Per&s;ia, Abdalla had little to fear from that
quarter. But as Kerim Chan has e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf, by the defeat and
death of his rivals, it is extremely probable, that Abdalla will &s;oon feel,
as we have already ob&s;erved, the weight of his arms, as Chorra&s;&s;&acirc;n
and Sei&s;tan are properly provinces of the Per&s;ian empire.</P>
<P> <PB N="81" REF="389"> However, Abdalla is, at pre&s;ent, at
peace with Kerim, and has taken that favorable opportunity for invading
Hindo&s;tan. He had, in April 1767, defeated the Seiks in three different
actions, and advanced to Sirhind, about forty crores from Delhi, with an army
of fifty thou&s;and hor&s;e. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that Nigib ul Dowla, who, in
the name of the pre&s;ent emperor's &s;on, manages the affairs of Delhi, had,
as he him&s;elf was hard pre&s;|&s;ed by the Seiks and Jates, called in
Abdalla, to take upon him the government. Nigib ul Dowla, by our be&s;t
intelligence, marched out of the city to meet his ally, with forty thou&s;and
men. The armies lay in fight of one another, and they were bu&s;y in
negotiation, and in &s;ettling a plan for their future opera|tions. Abdalla, in
the mean time, wrote circular letters to all the princes of India, commanding
them to acknowledge him KING OF KINGS, and demanding a tribute. Suja ul Dowlat,
in particular, had received a very &s;harp letter from him, upbraid|ing him for
his alliance with INFIDELS, and demanding the im|perial revenues, which that
&s;uba had converted to his own u&s;e for &s;ome years back.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of the affairs of Ahmed Abdalla, by our
la&s;t accounts from Delhi. This prince is brave and active, but he is now in
the decline of life. His per&s;on is tall and ro|bu&s;t, and inclinable to
being fat. His face is remarkably broad, his beard very black, and his
complexion moderately fair. His appearance, upon the whole, is maje&s;tic, and
expre&s;&s;ive of an uncommon dignity and &s;trength of mind. Though he is not
&s;o fierce and cruel as Nadir Shaw, he &s;upports his authority with no le&s;s
rigor, and he is by no means le&s;s brave than that extraor|dinary monarch. He,
in &s;hort, is the mo&s;t likely per&s;on now in India, to re&s;tore the
ancient power of the empire, &s;hould he a&s;&s;ume the title of king of
Delhi.</P>
<P> <PB N="82" REF="390"> The SEIKS border upon the Indian
dominions of Abdalla. That nation, it is &s;aid, take their name of SEIKS,
which &s;igni|fies DISCIPLES, from their being followers of a certain
philo&s;o|pher of Thibet, who taught the idea of a commonwealth, and the pure
doctrine of Dei&s;m, without any mixture of either the Mahommedan or Hindoo
&s;uper&s;titions. They made their fir&s;t appearance about the commencement of
this century, in the reign of Bahadar Shaw, but were rather reckoned then a
parti|ticular &s;ect than a nation. Since the empire began to decline, they
have prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed their numbers, by admitting pro&s;elytes of all
religions, without any other ceremony than an oath, which they tender to them,
to oppo&s;e monarchy.</P>
<P>The Seiks are, at pre&s;ent, divided into &s;everal &s;tates,
which in their internal government are perfectly independent of one another,
but they form a powerful alliance again&s;t their neighbors. When they are
threatened with inva&s;ions, an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates is called, and a
general cho&s;en by them, to lead their re&s;pective quotas of militia into the
field; but, as &s;oon as peace is re&s;tored, the power of this kind of
dictator cea&s;es, and he re|turns, in a private capacity, to his own
community. The Seiks are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole province of
Punj&acirc;b, the greate&s;t part of Moultan and Sind, both the banks of the
Indus from Ca&s;hmire to Tatta, and all the country towards Delhi, from Lahore
to Sirhind. They have, of late years, been a great check upon the arms of
Abdalla; and, though in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year they have been
un&s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t that prince in three actions, they are, by no means
&s;ubdued, but continue a &s;evere clog upon his ambitious views in India.</P>
<P>The chief who leads at pre&s;ent the army of the Seiks, is
Je&s;&s;arit Singh; there is al&s;o one Nitteh Singh, who is in great 
<PB N="83" REF="391"> e&s;teem among them. They can, upon an emergency,
mu&s;ter 60000 good hor&s;e; but, though in India they are e&s;teemed brave,
they chu&s;e rather to carry on their wars by &s;urprize and &s;tratagem, than
by regular operations in the field. By their principles of religion and
government, as well as on account of national injuries, they are inveterate
enemies to Abdalla, and to the Rohilla powers.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t of the dominions of the republic of the Seiks lie
the countries which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Rohilla Afgans. Nigib ul
Dowla, who&s;e hi&s;tory is comprehended in the preceding &s;ections, is, from
his power, as well as from the &s;trength of his councils and his own bravery,
reckoned their prince. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the city of Delhi, in the name of
the family of Timur, together with a con&s;iderable territory around it, on
both the banks of the Jumna, and his revenues amount to one crore of roupees.
He publickly acknowledges the unfortunate Shaw Allum, at Allahabad, king, and
allows a pen&s;ion to his &s;on Jewan Bucht, who, without any power, maintains
a kind of regal dignity at Delhi.</P>
<P>Nigib ul Dowla has been known, when hard pre&s;&s;ed by his
ho&s;tile neighbors, to rai&s;e 60000 hor&s;e; but his revenues are not
&s;ufficient to &s;upport one tenth part of that number. He continues to take
the held under the name of buck&s;hi, or captain-general of the Mogul empire;
and though he has not the power, or per|haps the inclination, to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the king, he keeps up a friendly corre&s;pondence with him, and, without any
nece&s;&s;ity, pro&s;e&s;&s;es obedience and a &s;hew of loyalty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Nigib ul Dowla, there are chiefs of the Rohilla race,
who are perfectly independent; but when danger pre&s;&s;es, they unite with him
their forces. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the&s;e chiefs <PB N="84" REF="392">
is Ha&s;iz Rhimut, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable di&s;trict between
the rivers. The next to him, in power, is Doondi Chan; and with him we may
number Mutta Hu&s;&s;ein, Jacob Ali Chan, Fatte Chan Zurein, and others of
le&s;s note, who command inde|pendent tribes beyond the Ganges to the north of
Delhi.</P>
<P>The whole power of the Rohillas may amount to 100,000 hor&s;e,
and an equal number of infantry, upon an emergency; but the&s;e are &s;o
wretchedly appointed and ill paid, that they furni&s;h more of ridicule, than
they can impre&s;s of terror in the field. Their infantry are armed with
rockets, pointed with iron, which they di&s;charge in vollies among cavalry,
which frighten more with their noi&s;e and uncommon appearance, than by the
execution which they make. The Rohillas are remarkable for nothing more than
their natural antipathy to the Mahrattors, which might be turned to advantage
by the Briti&s;h in their future views upon Hindo&s;tan: but the truth is, that
the Hindoos and Mahommedans &s;o equally ballance one another in that country,
that by &s;upporting one, we may, with great facility, command both.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall government of the Patans to the ea&s;t of the
Rohilla tribes. Their di&s;trict is bounded by the dominions of the pre&s;ent
king, by tho&s;e of Suja ul Dowlat, and by the terri|tories of the Jates. The
capital of this petty principality is Fero|chabad, which is &s;ituated upon the
banks of the Ganges, a few crores above the ruins of the celebrated city of
Kinnoge. Ahmed Chan Bungui&s;h, who made a great figure again&s;t Seifdar Jung,
the father of Suja ul Dowlat, rules over this di&s;trict. Ahmed is more
di&s;tingui&s;hed by his abilities and per&s;onal bravery, than by the extent
of his power. His revenues do not exceed fifty lacks; but he always keeps a
&s;tanding force of two or three thou&s;and <PB N="85" REF="393"> good hor&s;e,
which he pays well; and, upon an emergency, he rai&s;es all his va&s;&s;als,
who con&s;i&s;t of about 20000 men. His country is full of forts; and he has,
con&s;equently, been hitherto able to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the
Mahrattors, Jates, and Suja ul Dowlat, who have re&s;pectively invaded his
dominions.</P>
<P>The city of Agra, and a very con&s;iderable tract of country
round it, extending along the Jumna, from forty crores below that city to
within five of Delhi, and &s;tretching back to Gualier and Barampulla, are now
in the hands of a Hindoo nation, called the Jates. The raja who, commands the
Jates, is de&s;cended of the ancient race of the Jits, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the banks of the Indus, as far back as the reign of Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni.
From their prince, the whole body of the Jates, though made up of many
di&s;tinct tribes and &s;ects, take their name; but others, with le&s;s
probability, trace it to JATE, which in the Hindoo language &s;ignifies a
labourer.</P>
<P>The Jates made no figure in the Mogul empire, as a nation, till
the reign of Allumgire, commonly known in Europe by the name of Aurungzebe. In
that monarch's expedition to the Decan, they were fir&s;t heard of as a gang of
banditti, under an intrepid fellow, called Chura Mun. They were then &s;o
daring as to harra&s;s the rear of the imperial army. After the death of
Allumgire, the Jates took advantage of the growing imbecility of the empire,
and fortifying them&s;elves among the hills of Narvar, &s;pread their
depredations to the gates of Agra. Mokun Singh, who, after the death of Chura
Mun, commanded the Jates, took upon him&s;elf the title of Raja. Their power
increa&s;ed under Bodun Singh and Sourage Mull, which la&s;t was dignified with
titles from the emperor.</P>
<P> <PB N="86" REF="394"> Joahir Singh, the &s;on of Sourage Mull,
now reigns over the Jates, and is a very weak prince. His revenues do not
exceed two crores of roupees; his dominions, like the re&s;t of India, being
harra&s;&s;ed by the Mahrattors. He may, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, be able to
bring into the field &s;ixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and men, but he cannot keep
long in pay one third of that number. The dominions of the Jates abound with
&s;trong fortre&s;&s;es, &s;uch as Dieg, Cumbere, and Aliver; in one of which
their prince frequently re&s;ides, though he &s;pends the mo&s;t part of his
time at Agra.</P>
<P>To the &s;outh-we&s;t of the Jates, Mudoo Singh, a rajaput raja,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very con&s;iderable territory, and re&s;ides for the mo&s;t
part at Joinagur. He is the &s;on of Joy Singh, a prince famous for his
knowledge in a&s;tronomy, and other mathematical &s;ciences. He entertained
above a thou&s;and learned brahmins for &s;ome years, in rectifying the
kalendar, and in making new tables for the calculation of eclip&s;es, and for
determining the longitude and declination of the &s;tars.&mdash;The revenues of
Mudoo Singh are not very con&s;iderable, being reckoned only eighty lacks; his
domi|nions being woody, mountainous, and con&s;equently ill cultivated. He can,
however, rai&s;e forty thou&s;and men; and he him&s;elf is e&s;teemed a good
&s;oldier.</P>
<P>Bordering upon Mudoo Singh, upon the frontiers of the Decan, is
the exten&s;ive country of Marwar, ruled, at pre&s;ent, by Bija Singh, the
&s;on of Bucht Singh, and grand&s;on of Je&s;&s;awind Singh. Marwar, when the
empire was in a flouri&s;hing condition, yielded annually five crores of
roupees: at pre&s;ent its revenues do not amount to half that &s;um, on account
of the ince&s;&s;ant depredations of the Mahrattors, its next neighbours.</P>
<P>The next Hindoo government to Marwar, is that of Odipour. The
raja of this country is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Rana. 
<PB N="87" REF="395"> That prince, more from his nobility of family than from
his power, a&s;&s;umes a &s;uperiority over all the rajas of Hindo&s;tan. His
dominions were formerly very exten&s;ive, but, of late years, they have been
circum&s;cribed within narrower bounds. His territories abound with mountains
and fore&s;ts, and are almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded by the kingdoms of Malava and
Guzerat. His revenues are incon&s;iderable, and he cannot bring into the field
above fifteen thou&s;and men.&mdash;In the vallies between the mountains of
Odipour, there are many petty independent rajas; Bundi, Cottu, Rupnagur,
Je&s;&s;elmere, and Bianere, being governed by their re&s;pective princes, each
of whom can mu&s;ter &s;ix or eight thou|&s;and men.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Hindoo power in
Hindo&s;tan. The principal &s;eat of their government is Sattarah, and
&s;ometimes Puna, on the coa&s;t towards Bombay. Though the genuine Mahrattors
all over India do not exceed 60000 men, yet, from their &s;uperior bravery and
&s;ucce&s;s in depredation, thou&s;ands of all tribes enli&s;t them&s;elves
under their banners. The&s;e, in&s;tead of pay, receive a certain proportion of
the plunder. By this means an army of Mahrattors increa&s;es like a river, the
farther it advances; &s;o that it is no uncommon thing for a force of ten or
twelve thou&s;and genuine Mahrattors to grow into 100,000, before they arrive
in the place which they de&s;tine to plunder.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent chief of the Mahrattors is Ragenot Raw, the &s;on
of Bagiraw. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one half of Guzerat, and all the territories
between that province and the Decan. He has, of late years, extended his
conque&s;ts to all the provinces of Malava, and to a part of Allahabad; having
reduced Himmut Singh, raja of Gualier, Anarid Singh, raja of Badawir, Anarid
Singh, of Chunderi, and the princes of Dittea, Orcha, Elichpoor, Bandere, 
<PB N="88" REF="396"> and Ja&s;&s;ey; all of whom have become tributary to the
Mahrat|tors. They have, moreover, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Ori&s;&s;a,
which ought, in propriety, to be annexed to the &s;uba&s;hip of Bengal,
according to the late grant of the king to the Briti&s;h. Thus the dominions of
the Mahrattors extend quite acro&s;s the penin&s;ula of India, from the bay of
Bengal to the gulph of Cambait or Cambay.</P>
<P>The amount of the revenues of the Mahrattors cannot ea&s;ily be
a&s;certained. They mu&s;t, however, be very con&s;iderable. They &s;ub&s;i&s;t
their armies by depredations on their neighbors, and are become the terror of
the Ea&s;t, more on account of their barbarity than their valour. They never
want a pretence for ho&s;tilities. They demand the Chout, or fourth part of the
reve|nues of any province; and, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, they in|vade,
plunder, and lay wa&s;te the country. Their hor&s;es be|ing very hardy, their
incur&s;ions are &s;udden, unexpected, and dreadful. They generally appoint a
place of rendezvous, and their inva&s;ions are carried on by detached parties.
Should a con&s;iderable force at any time oppo&s;e them, they decline coming to
action; and, as they invigorate their hardy hor&s;es with opium, their flight,
like their incur&s;ions, is very expeditious.</P>
<P>The armies of the Mahrattors do not, like the troops of other
Indian powers, incumber them&s;elves with bazars or markets. They tru&s;t for
their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the countries through which they march. They are
armed with firelocks, &s;ome with match|lock guns, and others with bows,
&s;pears, javelins, &s;words and dag|gers. They have, within three years back,
made &s;ome advances towards forming a di&s;ciplined army of infantry. They
have, accordingly, at pre&s;ent, ten or twelve battalions of Seapoys, uniformly
cloathed and armed.&mdash;All the powers of India being now &s;en&s;ible of the
advantages which the Briti&s;h have gained by di&s;ciplined infantry, turn
their thoughts to a &s;imilar regulation in <PB N="89" REF="397"> their armies,
and to improve their artillery, which was formerly too unweildy and
ill-mounted, to be of any &s;ervice in the field.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t of Malava, and to the &s;outh of Allahabad, is the
country of Bundelcund, governed by Hindoput. His territories are of a
con&s;iderable extent and very fertile, and he moreover draws great wealth from
his diamond mines of Hieragur and Punagur. He al&s;o claims a right to the
mines of Sommelpour, but another raja po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them at
pre&s;ent.&mdash;The annual revenues of Hindoput amount to near two crores of
roupees, including the profits ari&s;ing from his mines. The&s;e he farms out
to merchant-adventurers, who purcha&s;e a certain number of &s;uperficial feet
of ground, and they are permitted to dig down perpendicularly as far as they
plea&s;e. Diamonds beyond a certain weight are the property of the prince, who
has in&s;pectors, to &s;uperintend the works.</P>
<P>The raja of Bundelcund po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the impregnable
fortre&s;s of Callinger and &s;everal other con&s;iderable &s;trong holds. He
has, notwith&s;tanding, been obliged to compound for a certain tribute with the
Mahrattors, who generally paid him an annual vi&s;it. Between Bundelcund and
Cattack, in Ori&s;&s;a, lie the raja&s;hips of Patna and Sommelpour, which are
not very con&s;iderable; the country being mountainous, woody, and unhealthy,
and the in|habitants barbarous in every re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Part of the province of Allahabad is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
SHAW ALLUM, by birthright and title, though nothing le&s;s &s;o in power,
emperor of Hindo&s;tan. He keeps the poor re&s;emblance of a court at
Allahabad, where a few ruined Omrahs, in hopes of better days to their prince,
having expended their fortunes in his &s;ervice, &s;till exi&s;t the ragged
pen&s;ioners of his poverty, and burthen his gratitude with their pre&s;ence.
The di&s;tricts of Korah and Allahabad, in the king's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, are
rated at thirty <PB N="90" REF="398"> lacks, which is one half more than they
are able to bear. In&s;tead of gaining by this bad policy, that prince,
unfortunate in many re&s;pects, has the mortification to &s;ee his poor
&s;ubjects oppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who farm the revenue, while he him&s;elf is
obliged to com|pound with the farmers for half the &s;tipulated &s;um.
Be&s;ides the revenue ari&s;ing from Allahabad and Korah, which we may at a
medium e&s;timate at twelve lacks, the Briti&s;h pay to the king twenty-&s;ix
lacks out of the revenues of Bengal; which is all Shaw Allum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
to &s;upport the dignity of the imperial hou&s;e of Timur.&mdash;It may not,
perhaps, be unacceptable to the public, to delineate, in this place, the
character of that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P>SHAW ALLUM is robu&s;t in his per&s;on, and about &s;ix feet
high. His complexion is rather darker than that which was common to the race of
Timur, and his countenance is expre&s;&s;ive of that melancholy which naturally
aro&s;e from his many misfor|tunes. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es per&s;onal courage;
but it is of the pa&s;&s;ive kind, and may be rather called fortitude to bear
adver&s;ity, than that daring boldne&s;s which loves to face danger.&mdash;He
has been &s;o often di&s;mounted in the cour&s;e of ambition, that he now fears
to give it the rein; and &s;eems le&s;s de&s;irous to make any efforts to
retrieve the power of his family, than to live quietly under the &s;hadow of
its eclip&s;ed maje&s;ty.&mdash;His clemency borders upon weakne&s;s, and his
good nature has totally &s;ubverted his authority. He is daily induced, by
importunity, to i&s;&s;ue out orders which he takes no means to inforce, and
which, he is certain, will not be obeyed. From this blemi&s;h in the character
of Shaw Allum, aro&s;e the half of his misfortunes; for the great &s;ecret of
e&s;tabli&s;h|ing authority, is to give no orders which cannot be inforced, and
rather to &s;uffer &s;mall injuries, than &s;hew re&s;entment, without the
power of puni&s;hing.</P>
<P> <PB N="91" REF="399"> His genero&s;ity is more than equal to
his abilities, and, too often, ill be&s;towed. He is too much addicted to
women, and takes more pains to maintain his Haram, than to &s;upport an
army.&mdash;But though we cannot call him a great prince, we mu&s;t allow him
to be a good man. His virtues are many; but they are tho&s;e of private life,
which never appear with lu&s;tre upon a throne. His judgment is by no means
weak; but his pa&s;&s;ions are not &s;trong: the ea&s;ine&s;s of his temper is
therefore moulded like wax by every hand; and he always gives up his own better
opinion for tho&s;e of men of inferior parts.&mdash;He is affable in his
conver&s;ation, but &s;eldom de&s;cends to plea&s;antry. Upon the whole, though
Shaw Allum is by no means qualified to re&s;tore a lo&s;t empire, he might have
maintained it with dignity in pro&s;perous times, and tran&s;mitted his name,
as a virtuous prince, to po&s;terity. It is with great regret that the author,
from his regard to truth, cannot &s;peak more favorably of a prince, to whom
his gratitude and attachment are due, for repeated te&s;timonies of his
e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The territories of Suja ul Dowlat, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the
province of Oud, border upon tho&s;e of the king. His revenues amount to near
two crores of roupees, out of which he pays nothing to the emperor, though he
pretends to recognize his title as his &s;overeign. Since his defeat at Buxar,
Suja ul Dowlat attends very much to the di&s;cipline of his army, and the
proper regu|lation of his finances. He has already formed ten battalions of
Seapoys, and has made great improvements in his artillery. When the news of
Abdalla's late inva&s;ion came, he levied twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e, upon a
better footing than is generally practi&s;ed in Hindo&s;tan. He is now the ally
of the Briti&s;h in India, and as his revenues will never enable him to
&s;upport him&s;elf in the field again&s;t them, it is probable his principle
of <PB N="92" REF="400"> fear, for he has none of honor or gratitude, will make
him &s;tand to the letter of the treaty.</P>
<P>Suja ul Dowlat is extremely hand&s;ome in his per&s;on; about
five feet eleven inches in height, and &s;o nervous and &s;trong, that, with
one &s;troke of the &s;abre, he can cut off the head of a buffalo. He is
active, pa&s;&s;ionate, ambitious; his penetrating eye &s;eems, at fir&s;t
&s;ight, to promi&s;e uncommon acutene&s;s and fire of mind: but his genius is
too volatile for depth of thought; and he is con&s;equently more fit for the
manly exerci&s;es of the field, than for deliberation in the
clo&s;et.&mdash;Till of late he gave little atten|tion to bu&s;ine&s;s. He was
up before the &s;un, mounted his hor&s;e, ru&s;hed into the fore&s;t, and
hunted down tigers or deer till the noon of day. He then returned, plunged into
the cold bath, and &s;pent his afternoons in the Haram among his
women.&mdash;Such was the bias of Suja ul Dowlat's mind till the late war.
Ambitious without true policy, and intoxicated with the pa&s;&s;ions of youth,
he began a wild career, in which he was &s;oon checked. Stung with the lo&s;s
of reputation, his pa&s;&s;ions have taken another cour&s;e. His activity is
employed in di&s;cipling his army, and he now &s;pends more time at the
comptoir of his finances, than in dallying with the ladies of his &s;eraglio.
His authority, there|fore, is e&s;tabli&s;hed, his revenues increa&s;ed, and
his army on a re&s;pectable footing. But, with all his &s;plendid qualities, he
is cruel, treacherous, unprincipled, deceitful: carrying a &s;pe|cious
appearance, purpo&s;ely to betray, and when he embraces with one hand, will
&s;tab with the other to the heart. Toge|ther with being heir to the fruits of
his father's crimes, he in|herits all his latent ba&s;ene&s;s of mind; for, if
we except per&s;onal courage, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not one virtue more than
Sei&s;dar Jung.</P>
<P>The province of Oud is &s;ituated to the north-ea&s;t of the
Ganges, bordering upon Behar, from which it is, on the one &s;ide, divided by
the river Deo, or Gagera, and on the other by <PB N="93" REF="401"> the
Carumna&s;&s;a. The country is level, well cultivated and wa|tered. It is
divided, on the north, by a chain of mountains from Thibet. In the vallies,
which inter&s;ect that immen&s;e ridge of hills, there are &s;everal
independent rajas, too incon&s;iderable to be formidable to Suja ul Dowlat.</P>
<P>The provinces of Bengal and Behar are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
Briti&s;h Ea&s;t-India company, in reality, by the right of arms, though, in
appearance, by a grant from the pre&s;ent emperor. This is not a proper place
to enter into particulars concerning tho&s;e pro|vinces: it may &s;uffice to
ob&s;erve, that Bengal and Behar, in|cluding what is called the company's lands
and duties upon mer|chandize, yielded in April, 1766, 33,025,968 Sicca,
roupees. The expences of government, the tribute to the king, and a pen&s;ion
to a nabob, &s;et up on account of the villainies of his father, amounted to
22,450,000 roupees, and con&s;equently the ballance in favor of the company was
10,575,968 roupees, or 1,321,994l. 15s. of our money.&mdash;The Briti&s;h force
in Bengal con&s;i&s;ts of three battalions of Europeans, and thirty of Seapoys,
regularly armed, di&s;ciplined, and uniformly cloathed; &s;o that we are much
&s;uperior, even upon that e&s;tabli&s;hment, to any other power at pre&s;ent
in Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>In the Decan the Briti&s;h are almo&s;t as powerful as in
Bengal. We &s;upport Mahommed Ali, as nominal nabob of the Carnatic, while, in
fact, we govern the country without control, having the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the garri&s;ons and the di&s;po&s;al of the revenues. The power of the Nizam,
who re&s;ides at Hydrabad, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the province of
Golconda, is, of late, very much circum&s;cribed. He, however, &s;till
maintains an army of 60 or 70000 men; but without di&s;cipline, and ill paid
they are by no means formidable. He, &s;ome time ago, entered into a treaty
with the Briti&s;h, but he has, of late, &s;hewn no di&s;po&s;ition to ad|here
to it long.</P>
<P> <PB N="94" REF="402"> Hydernaig, a &s;oldier of fortune, who,
by his, per&s;onal merit, rai&s;ed him&s;elf from a common Seapoy, to be
&s;overeign of almo&s;t all the coa&s;t of Malabar, threatened, la&s;t year, to
attack the Nizam, if he did not break his unnatural alliance with the
Bri|ti&s;h. The part which the Nizam will take upon this occa&s;ion, will
entirely depend on the &s;pirit of the councils of the Briti&s;h on the
coa&s;t.&mdash;As Hydernaig had al&s;o threatened Mahommed Ali, nabob of the
Carnatic, it was judged prudent to march an army again&s;t him in March, 1767;
but what &s;ucce&s;s may have attended the expedition, has not hitherto reached
Europe.</P>
<P>Hydernaig is &s;aid to have thirty di&s;ciplined battalions of
Sea|poys, twenty thou&s;and good hor&s;e, and a great train of artillery,
wrought by five hundred European renegadoes. This prince having &s;erved in
per&s;on in European armies, models his troops upon their plan, pays
punctually, and enforces di&s;cipline with rigor. Together with being an able
politician, he is a daring, active, and impetuous &s;oldier, and if he is not
immediately cru&s;hed, he may prove the mo&s;t dangerous enemy that the
Briti&s;h have hitherto met with in the Ea&s;t. He is, at pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t
for|midable prince in all India, and he will, no doubt, take advantage of the
divided &s;tate of that country, and endeavor to extend his conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus have we, in a few words, endeavored to give a general idea
of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Hindo&s;tan. The reflexions which naturally ari&s;e
from the &s;ubject, might &s;well this work into a volume. It is apparent,
however, from what has been &s;aid, that the immen&s;e regions of Hindo&s;tan
might be all reduced by a handful of regular troops.&mdash;Ten thou&s;and
European infantry, together with the Seapoys in the company's &s;ervice, are
not only &s;ufficient to conquer all India, but, with proper policy, to
main|tain it, for ages, as an appendage of the Briti&s;h crown.&mdash;This
po&s;ition may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear a paradox, to people unac|quainted 
<PB N="95" REF="403"> with the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants of
Hindo&s;tan: but to tho&s;e who have con&s;idered both with atten|tion, the
thing &s;eems not only practicable, but ea&s;y.</P>
<P>That &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, which the Indians &s;uffer
from their native princes, make the ju&s;tice and regularity of a Briti&s;h
go|vernment appear to them in the mo&s;t favorable light. The great men of the
country have no more idea of patrioti&s;m, than the meane&s;t &s;laves; and the
people can have no attachment to chiefs whom they regard as tyrants. Soldiers
of fortune are &s;o numerous in India, that they comprehend one fourth of the
inha|bitants of that exten&s;ive country. They are never paid one third of the
&s;tipulated &s;um, by the princes of Hindo&s;tan, which renders them mutinous
and di&s;contented; but they would mo&s;t certainly approve them&s;elves
obedient, faithful, and brave, in the &s;ervice of a power who &s;hould pay
them regularly.</P>
<P>In a country like India, where all religions are tolerated, the
people can have no objection to the Briti&s;h, on account of theirs. The army
might be compo&s;ed of an equal number of Mahom|medans and Hindoos, who would
be a check upon one another, while a &s;mall body of Europeans would be a
&s;ufficient check upon both. The battalions ought to be commanded altogether
by European officers, who, if they do their duty properly, and behave with
ju&s;tice to their men, may attach them to their per|&s;ons, with &s;tronger
ties than any troops born in Europe. But if ju&s;tice is not ob&s;erved to
&s;oldiers, human nature, in this, as in all countries, will and mu&s;t revolt
again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the black officers of the Seapoys mu&s;t ri&s;e
from the ranks. This is &s;ound policy, and ought to be continued. Men of
family and influence are deterred, by this circum&s;tance, from entering into
the &s;ervice. The&s;e officers are, therefore, en|tirely our creatures, and
will never de&s;ert a people, among whom <PB N="96" REF="404"> alone they can
have any power; for no acquired di&s;cipline will give weight to a mean man,
&s;ufficient to bring to the field an army of Indians.</P>
<P>The advantages of a conque&s;t of Hindo&s;tan to this country
are obvious. It would pay as much of the national debt, as go|vernment &s;hould
plea&s;e to di&s;charge. Should the influx of wealth rai&s;e the price of the
nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, the poor, on the other hand, by being
ea&s;ed of mo&s;t of their taxes, would be more able to purcha&s;e
them.&mdash;But, &s;ay &s;ome grave morali&s;ts, how can &s;uch a &s;cheme be
reconciled to ju&s;tice and humanity?&mdash;This is an objection of no
weight.&mdash;Hindo&s;tan is, at pre&s;ent, torn to pieces by factions. All
laws, divine and human, are trampled under foot.&mdash;In&s;tead of one tyrant,
as in the times of the empire, the country now groans under thou|&s;ands; and
the voice of the oppre&s;&s;ed multitude reaches heaven. It would, therefore,
be promoting the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and hu|manity, to pull tho&s;e petty
tyrants from the height to which their villainies have rai&s;ed them, and to
give to &s;o many millions of mankind, a government founded upon the principles
of virtue and ju&s;tice.&mdash;The ta&s;k is no le&s;s glorious than it is
prac|ticable; for it might be accompli&s;hed with half the blood which is often
expended, in Europe, upon an ideal &s;y&s;tem of a ballance of power, and in
commercial wars, which mu&s;t be attended with little eclat, as they are
de&s;titute of &s;triking and beneficial con&s;equences.</P>
