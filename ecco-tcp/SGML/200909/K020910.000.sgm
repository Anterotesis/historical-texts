<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES of old, the Learn'd in Language &s;ay,</L>
<L>Were merely Introductions to the Play,</L>
<L>Spoken by Gods, or Gho&s;ts, or Men who knew</L>
<L>Whate'er was previous to the Scenes in view;</L>
<L>And complai&s;antly came to lay before ye</L>
<L>The &s;everal Heads, and Windings of the Story.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But modern Times and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rules are &s;uch,</L>
<L>Our Bards beforehand mu&s;t not tell too much;</L>
<L>Nor dare we, like the neighb'ring <HI>French,</HI> admit</L>
<L>Ev'n Confidantes, who might in&s;truct the Pit,</L>
<L>By a&s;king Que&s;tions of the leading Few,</L>
<L>And hearing Secrets, which before they knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet what we can to help this antique Piece</L>
<L>We will attempt.&mdash;Our Scene to-night is <HI>Greece.</HI></L>
<L>And, by the Magic of the Poet's Rod,</L>
<L>This Stage the Temple of the <HI>Delphic</HI> God!</L>
<L>Where Kings, and Chiefs, and Sages came of old,</L>
<L>Like modern Fools, to have their Fortunes told;</L>
<L>And Monarchs were enthron'd, or Nations freed,</L>
<L>As an old Prie&s;t, or wither'd Maid decreed.</L>
<L>Yet think not all were equally deceiv'd,</L>
<L>Some knew, more doubted, many more believ'd.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, the&s;e Oracles, and witching Rhimes</L>
<L>Were but the pious Frauds of ancient Times;</L>
<L>Wi&s;ely contriv'd to keep Mankind in awe,</L>
<L>When Faith was Wonder, and Religion Law!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus much premis'd, to every feeling Brea&s;t</L>
<L>We leave the Scenes them&s;elves to tell the re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;Yet &s;omething &s;ure was to the Critics &s;aid,</L>
<L>Which I forget,&mdash;&s;ome Invocation made!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Critic Bands, like jealous Guardians, plac'd</L>
<L>To watch th' Encroachments on the Realms of Ta&s;te,</L>
<L>From you our Author would two Boons obtain,</L>
<L>Not wholly diffident, nor wholly vain:</L>
<L>Two things he a&s;ks; 'tis mode&s;t &s;ure, from you</L>
<L>Who can do all things, to reque&s;t but two:</L>
<L>Fir&s;t to his Scenes a kind Attention pay,</L>

<L>Had made the Lover of our pre&s;ent Queen</L>

<L>'Twas by his Means he fell, tho' that my Heart</L>
<L>Con&s;ents not to believe. Thus much is &s;ure,</L>

<LG>
<L>AT length I'm freed from Tragical Parade,</L>
<L>No more a <HI>Pythian</HI> Prie&s;te&s;s,&mdash;tho' a Maid;</L>
<L>At once re&s;igning, with my &s;acred Dwelling,</L>
<L>My Wreaths, my Wand, my Arts of Fortune-telling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;uper&s;titious Folks, no doubt, are here,</L>
<L>Who &s;till regard me with a kind of Fear,</L>
<L>Le&s;t to their &s;ecret Thoughts the&s;e prying Eyes</L>
<L>Should boldly pa&s;s, and take them by Surprize.</L>
<L>Nay, tho' I di&s;avow the whole Deceit,</L>
<L>And fairly own my Science all a Cheat,</L>
<L>Should I declare, in &s;pite of Ears and Eyes,</L>
<L>The Beaus were hand&s;ome, or the Critics wi&s;e,</L>
<L>They'd all believe it, and with dear Delight</L>
<L>Say to them&s;elves at lea&s;t,</L>
<L>"The Girl has Ta&s;te;" "the Woman's in the right."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, &s;hould I tell the Ladies, &s;o di&s;pos'd,</L>
<L>They'd get good Matches, ere the Sea&s;on clos'd,</L>
<L>They'd &s;mile, perhaps, with &s;eeming Di&s;content,</L>
<L>And, &s;neering, wonder what the Creature meant;</L>
<L>But whi&s;per to their Friends, with beating Heart.</L>
<L>"Suppo&s;e there &s;hould be &s;omething in her Art"</L>
<L>Grave State&s;men too would chuckle, &s;hould I &s;ay,</L>
<L>On &s;uch a Motion, and by &s;uch a Day,</L>
<L>They would be &s;ummon'd from their own Affairs</L>
<L>To 'tend the Nation's more important Cares;</L>
<L>"Well, if I mu&s;t&mdash;howe'er I dread the Load,</L>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</STAGE>
<L>STAY, Ladies&mdash;Tho' I'am almo&s;t tir'd to Death</L>
<L>With this long Part&mdash;and am &s;o out of Breath&mdash;</L>
<L>Yet &s;uch a lucky Thought kind Heaven has &s;ent,</L>
<L>That if I die for't, I mu&s;t give it Vent.</L>
<L>The Men you know are gone. And now, &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>Before our Lords and Ma&s;ters are recho&s;e,</L>
<L>We take th' Advantage of an empty Town,</L>
<L>And chu&s;e a Hou&s;e of Commons of our own.</L>
<L>What think ye, cannot we make Laws?&mdash;and then</L>
<L>Cannot we too unmake them, like the Men?</L>
<L>O place us once in good St. <HI>Stephen's</HI> Pews,</L>
<L>We'll &s;hew them Women have their public U&s;e.</L>
<L>Imprimis they &s;hall marry; not a Man</L>
<L>Pa&s;t twenty-five, but what &s;hall wear the Chain.</L>
<L>Next, we'll in earne&s;t &s;et about Reclaming,</L>
<L>For, by my Life and Soul, we'll put down Gaming.</L>
<L>We'll &s;poil their deep de&s;tructive Midnight Play;</L>
<L>The Laws we make, we'll force them to obey;</L>
<L>Unle&s;s we let them, when their Spirits flag,</L>
<L>Piddle with us, ye know, at Quinze and Brag.</L>
<L>"I hope, my Deare&s;t," &s;ays &s;ome well-bred Spou&s;e,</L>
<L>"When &s;uch a Bill &s;hall come before your Hou&s;e,</L>
<L>"That you'll con&s;ider Men are Men&mdash;at lea&s;t</L>
<L>"That you'll not Speak, my Dear."&mdash;Not &s;peak?&mdash;The Bea&s;t!</L>
<L>What, would you wound my Honour?&mdash;Wrongs like the&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>For this, Sir, I &s;hall bring you on your Knees.</L>
<L>&mdash;Or, if we're quite good-natur'd, tell the Man</L>
<L>We'll do him all the Service that we can.</L>
<L>Then for our&s;elves, what Projects, what De&s;igns?</L>
<L>We'll tax, and double tax their na&s;ty Wines;</L>
<L>But Duty-free import our Blonds and Laces,</L>
<L><HI>French</HI> Hoops, <HI>French</HI> Silks, <HI>French</HI> Cambricks, and&mdash;<HI>French</HI> Faces.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, my Scheme is not compleated quite,</L>
<L>But I may tell ye more another Night.</L>
<L>So come again, come all, and let us rai&s;e</L>
<L>Such glorious Trophies to our Country's Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>That all true <HI>Britons</HI> &s;hall with one Con&s;ent</L>
