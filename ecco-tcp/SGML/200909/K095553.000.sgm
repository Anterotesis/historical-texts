<HEAD>THE Epi&s;tle DEDICATORY, TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Fair Authre&s;s of the following Sheets being Dead, and the Publication of them falling into my Hands, I could not think of any PATRON, under who&s;e Protection, they
<PB N="iv" REF="3">might with that Advantage I de|&s;ir'd, venture into the Publick, &s;o properly as your Lord&s;hip's. For, where better could HEROIC LOVE, and all the PATRIOT VIRTUES find a &s;urer and more au&s;picious Refuge, than under that <HI>Nobleman</HI>'s Protection, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd Honour, and good Sen&s;e has render'd him &s;o emi|nently capable of the <HI>former;</HI> and who&s;e <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t Zeal</HI> for his Coun|try's Service in the mo&s;t dubious, and difficult of Times has been &s;o con&s;picuous to all that know any thing of our publick Affairs, as that of your Lord&s;hip. Yes, my Lord, that Heroic Firmne&s;s and Re|&s;olution you di&s;cover'd then in your Conduct, has made you the pecu|liar Darling of all true BRITONS, of all Lovers of the be&s;t of Kings, and Con&s;titutions. <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> and <HI>Uncorruptible Faith</HI> are not
<PB N="v" REF="4">the common Growth of this Age, which makes every Con&s;ideration yield to the poor an mean Pro|&s;pects of immediate and Per&s;onal Advantages, either in Wealth, or in Power and Dignities; and few, very few have been found, whom neither the Malice and ungenerous Per&s;ecution of Potent and di&s;ap|pointed Enemies could break, nor all the gilded Baits of Power, Riches, Flattery, Plea&s;ure, and the other cunning Arts of in&s;inu|ating into the Minds of the young and uncautious (in which vile Arts, tho&s;e were no &s;mall Profi|cients, who had then the Publick Management of Affairs) could corrupt, or give the lea&s;t &s;hock to; on who&s;e Wiles, tho' many were deceived by them, your Lord&s;hip, &s;upported by a perfect Integrity, and ju&s;t Under&s;tand|ing, look'd down and de&s;pis'd.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">IT is &s;uch a Publick Spirit, &s;uch an Under&s;tanding, that qua|lifies a Nobleman to be worthy of the Addre&s;&s;es of the MUSES. For whoever loves his Country, mu&s;t be pleas'd to &s;ee ARTS Flouri&s;h, which add to its Glory and its Felicity; &s;ince that Coun|try can only be e&s;tem'd truly Hap|py and Great, where ARTS as well as Arms find publick Encou|ragement. And of all ARTS, POETRY is perhaps the chief, which de&s;erves the peculiar Care of the <HI>Great</HI> and the <HI>Polite.</HI></P>
<P>IF we may decide this by what we find in Hi&s;tory, it is plain, that where-ever Heroic Fortitude, and Martial Glory have found a di|&s;tingui&s;hing Succe&s;s, there POE|TRY has met with the greate&s;t Indulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"><HI>ATHENS,</HI> which poli&s;h'd Mankind by her POETS, was able by her &s;ingle Valour, un|der the Conduct of MILTIADES, with Ten Thou&s;and Men, to de|feat &s;ome Hundreds of Thou&s;ands of <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> ROME in her great|e&s;t Glory, and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd Fortune, became a Rival of GREECE in that <HI>Noble Art,</HI> while VIRGIL, HORACE, VA|RIUS, TUCCA and many more, found them&s;elves the peculiar Fa|vourites of the able&s;t State&s;man, and mo&s;t illu&s;trious Emperor that Nation ever knew.</P>
<P>IT would be no difficult Mat|ter, my Lord, to carry on the Proof of this in a le&s;s eminent degree through the &s;everal King|doms that aro&s;e out of the Ruins of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> even from
<PB N="viii" REF="7"><HI>Italy,</HI> to <HI>Hungary;</HI> but that would be a Work of too large an Extent for the narrow Compa&s;s of an Epi&s;tle. By hinting his here, I only aim at &s;tirring up, if po&s;&s;i|ble, a generous Ambition in our Great Men, of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves in a manner &s;o wor|thy of Power and Dignity.</P>
<P>I have known a Nobleman, who (I know not by what means) got a popularity for his Genero|&s;ity, who yet could only ju&s;t|ly pretend to an injudicious Profu&s;ion; for he has given a Pi|per Three Hundred Guineas, when a MAN of LEARNING found but a very mean Gra|tuity for a mo&s;t valuable Per|formance. But &s;everal have, in|deed, been bountiful to Fidlers, and the <HI>thrilling Throng,</HI> while we have found very few SIDNEYS
<PB N="ix" REF="8">and SACKVILES, &s;ince we have pretended to Politene&s;s; and yet the many Excellent Products of Poetry, with little or no Encou|ragement, are a Proof that it is the natural Growth of the Clime, and with a tolerable Cultivation, might arrive at the greate&s;t Per|fection.</P>
<P>THE following Sheets, my Lord, are of this Kind; that is, they are allow'd by the Learned to be a u&s;eful &s;ort of POETRY, tho' without the advantageous Har|mony of Ver&s;e. For as all POE|TRY is an IMITATION, as ARI|STOTLE ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, it is plain that all <HI>Fables</HI> are IMITATIONS of <HI>Actions,</HI> which is the e&s;&s;ence of both the DRAMATIC and EPIC POESIE.</P>
<P>BUT this <HI>Pro&s;aic Poetry</HI> is of as ancient a Date as the <HI>Mile|&s;ian
<PB N="x" REF="9">Tales,</HI> which &s;o charm'd An|tiquity it &s;elf. The Moderns &s;ince the Time of HELIODORUS, have often vary'd their Form; &s;ome Years ago they &s;well'd them into large Volumes, but of late the general Ta&s;t runs for &s;uch as are compriz'd in a much nar|rower Compa&s;s; from whence we derive &s;o many Books of TALES, which have not yet fail'd of Suc|ce&s;s. The&s;e that follow, in my Opinion, fall not in the lea&s;t &s;hort of the mo&s;t excellent that have yet appear'd; there being a Pa|thetic Tenderne&s;s, that runs quite through them, &s;upported by a Noble and Heroic Fortitude.</P>
<P>THE Preface will &s;hew your Lord&s;hip that their Foundation is laid on true Hi&s;tory, and the La|dy has &s;o artfully Grafted the Fiction upon it, that the whole
<PB N="xi" REF="10">bears the plea&s;ing Appearance of Truth and Reality.</P>
<P>If they contribute to the Di|ver&s;ion of any Hour of your Lord&s;hip's more elegant Lei&s;ure, I have my Aim. My Ambition to give this publick Te&s;timony of my E&s;teem and Value for your Lord&s;hip's &s;ingular Virtues, would not &s;uffer me to lo&s;e the fir&s;t Op|portunity of doing it, unable to delay my Zeal 'till I had &s;ome|thing more &s;olid to offer; though perhaps, in Ju&s;tice, it is not the mo&s;t unmeritorious Endeavour to con|tribute to our Diver&s;ion; and I hope it will be thus favourably re|ceiv'd by your Lord&s;hip from,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I HERE pre&s;ent the Reader with &s;ome few of tho&s;e many Tran&s;actions which made up the Lives of two of the mo&s;t Potent Monarchs of the <HI>Mile&s;ian</HI> Race, in that Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Ireland:</HI> And although I have cloath'd it with the Dre&s;s and Title of a Novel; yet (&s;o far I dare &s;peak in my own behalf, that) I have err'd as little from the Truth of the Hi&s;tory, as any per|haps
<PB REF="12">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="13">who have undertaken any thing of this Nature.</P>
<P>What I have added, is only the Love and Amorous Di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Murchoe</HI> and <HI>Dooneflaith;</HI> who&s;e Name I have pre&s;um'd upon, &s;ince in the Chronicles and Writings of all tho&s;e, which I have read, who have Treated on that Subject, make no mention of the Name of <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI>'s Daughter; tho' none af them hardly but take no|tice of the Story. And finding in Dr. <HI>Ketrius</HI>'s <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> that of <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> to be in u&s;e at that time, and (if I mi&s;take not) to be the Name of her Mother, I therefore was the more willing to imagin I &s;hould not err &s;o much from Truth, as if I had given her a feign'd one, to give that to her Daughter.</P>
<P>Some (upon what Grounds I know not) would needs have their manner and way of making Love,
<PB REF="14">which I have brought as near as I could to our modern Phra&s;e, to be too Pa&s;&s;ionate and Elegant for the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and contrary to the Humours, they alledge, of &s;o Rude and Illite|rate a People; when all the while they do not con&s;ider, that altho' they may &s;eem &s;o now, in the Cir|cum&s;tances they lie under, (having born the heavy Yoke of Bondage for &s;o many Years, and have been Cow'd down in their Spirits) yet that once <HI>Ireland</HI> was e&s;teem'd one of the Principal Nations in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> for Piety and Learning; ha|ving formerly been &s;o Holy, that it was term'd <HI>The I&s;land of Saints;</HI> and for Learning &s;o Eminent, as all their Chronicles make out, and &s;ome others who were not of that Nation, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;t. Anglic.</HI> lib. 3. cap. 4, 5, 19. &amp; lib. 4. cap. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Bede,</HI> and<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Camden Brittan.</HI> p. 730. Edit.

<P><PB REF="15">It was &s;o Famous for Breeding, that many from the adjacent I&s;lands, and mo&s;t parts of the Continent of <HI>Europe</HI> came thither for it.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch as <HI>P. Wal&s;h</HI> &s;ays in his Pro&s;pect of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that when any were wanting from their own Country, it came to be a Proverb, <HI>He is gone to</HI> Ireland <HI>to be bred.</HI></P>
<P>And another in the Life of <HI>Sul|genus,</HI> has this Di&s;tich.</P>
<Q><L>Exemplo patrum commotus amori legendi,</L>
<L>Ivit ad Hibernos Sophia mirabile daros.</L></Q>
<P>And we find in their Chroni|cles, that there were Four Great Univer&s;ities in <HI>Ireland,</HI> viz. <HI>Ard|magh, Ca&s;hell, Dunda-Leath|ghla&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Li&s;more,</HI> be&s;ides many other Colleges of le&s;s Note el&s;e|where; and as <HI>Keting</HI> in his <HI>Ma|nu&s;cript</HI>
<PB REF="16">has it, in the Reign of <HI>Couchuvair Mac-Donochoe,</HI> that there were no le&s;s that <HI>7000</HI> Scholars at one time in one of tho&s;e Univer&s;ities, <HI>viz. Ardmagh;</HI> and that they were the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in tho&s;e Days who gave a beginning Abroad, as &s;ome Writers &s;ay, to the Schools of <HI>Oxford.</HI> But it is mo&s;t certain they did to tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Pavia,</HI> and many other great Colleges of Learning in Fo|regn Parts.</P>
<P>And both <HI>Camden</HI> and <HI>Ed|mund Spen&s;er</HI> in his <HI>View of Ireland,</HI> page <HI>29.</HI> do acknow|ledge, <HI>That our Ance&s;tors in</HI> Great Britain <HI>learned the very form and manner of framing their Chara|cter for Writing, from</HI> Ireland.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, (tho' not a Tenth part of what might be on this very account) I hop'd I might have liberty to dre&s;s their words in as becoming a Phra&s;e as
<PB REF="17">my weak Capacity could frame, or the time that I did it in would allow.</P>
<P>As for the other part of the Story, it is all Hi&s;torical, and treads only the Path of the true Chronicle, if we may give Credit to my Authors, who are <HI>Bede, Camden, Heylin, Spen&s;er, Han|mor, Campion,</HI> Dr. <HI>Keting,</HI> Sir <HI>James Ware, Flahertus,</HI> and <HI>P. Wal&s;h.</HI> I have, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, omitted &s;everal Remarkable Pa&s;|&s;ages, and Twenty four of the Twenty five Battles which <HI>Bryan Boraimh</HI> Fought in his Reign and won; but yet I have not foi&s;ted in any thing, that might be injurious to the Truth, in their Places, and have only made a Compendium of Things as tho' done in four or five Years time, which perhaps were Tran&s;acting half &s;o many &s;core.</P>
<P><PB REF="18">I have con&s;train'd my &s;elf, con|trary to the Cu&s;tom of mo&s;t who write the&s;e &s;ort of E&s;&s;ays, to make my Lovers die unmarried; &s;ince I could find no Authority to the contrary. And I &s;hould indeed have been very willing to have embrac'd the Opportunity (could I have found any colour for it) of making them, after &s;o many Mi&s;|fortunes, to have ended their Trou|ble in the Married Bed.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;ince my De&s;ign in the beginning was to &s;hew the &s;trange means by which <HI>Ireland</HI> was once deliver'd from the Tyranny of <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> and the <HI>Danes,</HI> by the Beauty of a Virgin; I thought it might not be impertinent to the Story, to make the &s;ame Maid, tho' in a more vertuous way, be the In&s;trument of &s;aving it a &s;e|cond time, by infu&s;ing of Courage into her Lover, who, we'll &s;up|po&s;e for her &s;ake, did things that
<PB REF="19">Day, which almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;s all be|lief; tho' at the &s;ame time &s;he had little or no part it may be in the Victory. This Licen&s;e I pre&s;um'd might lawfully be granted in a Novel.</P>

<HEAD>Iri&s;h TALES.</HEAD>
<P>_LASTING and Ter|rible were the bloody Wars which the An|cient <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd a|gain&s;t the powerful <HI>Danes;</HI> who, by their va&s;t Num|bers, and continual &s;upplies of fre&s;h Men, who Recruited them daily, and were weekly landing at one Port or other, came to their aid, they being then Ma&s;ters of the Sea, &s;o hara&s;s'd and tir'd the long defending I&s;landers, that at la&s;t they were forc'd to &s;ubmit, and their Provincial Kings become
<PB N="2" REF="21">for &s;ome &s;mall &s;pace of Time, Tributaries to the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius,</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Captain General, being a Soldier of in|vincible Courage, and no le&s;s Ambitious, made him&s;elf be &s;til'd Monarch of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with a Splendid and Magnificent Train of hardy and re&s;olute War|riors, whom Peace and Idlene&s;s, the Seeds of Wickedne&s;s, and the Mildew of Vertue had ru|&s;ted into Courtiers, kept his Court in the center of the Coun|try, at <HI>Lough-Ribh,</HI> near that place, where now &s;tands the Town of <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>He was a Man &s;o skill'd and train'd up in Arms, and Martial Fatigues, that had he only fol|low'd the Bu&s;ine&s;s he profe&s;s'd, his Conque&s;ts and Victories might have been an everla&s;ting Theme for Ages to come; and had not his Lu&s;t like a Canker eaten away
<PB N="3" REF="22">the In&s;criptions his Sword had en|graven, his Victorious Memory might to this day have been the enduring Song of Fame.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> having &s;ubdu'd the be&s;t part of the People of this Na|tion, nay, indeed, we may &s;ay all, but a few who knew not how to bow their Necks in &s;ubjection to any but a lawful Prince, or &s;toop to any thing beneath their free Liberties, and Obedience to their own Kings, had betaken them&s;elves to Boggs, Woods, Mountains, Rocks, and inacce&s;&s;ible Places; who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Con|duct being back'd with an inimi|table Valour, in a few Weeks wrought out their own Infran|chizements, and broke the &s;ervile Bonds, in which their fellow <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were en&s;lav'd, notwith&s;tanding the mighty Care and Circum&s;pe|ction <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> us'd to the contra|ry; for there was not a Hole, or
<PB N="4" REF="23">a Corner, much le&s;s a Town or a City in the whole Realm, that was capable of it, in which he had not planted a Garri&s;on, made as he thought, &s;ecure by impreg|nable Fortifications.</P>
<P>All things being order'd in this manner, he began to partake of the Plea&s;ures of Peace, which his long Toil and indefatigable La|bours had newly e&s;tabli&s;h'd. Tho&s;e cruel Wars which had o|pen'd the veins of this di&s;temper'd &s;ick Kingdom, had not yet drain'd one drop of his ill Blood, which corrupting for want of u&s;ual Ex|erci&s;e, made him degenerate from the noble Science of War, to pra|cti&s;e that of Love; and giving way to his unruly Pa&s;&s;ion, be|came in a &s;hort time wholly Conquer'd by the fair Eyes of <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> King of <HI>Meath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="24">This Lady was one, on whom Nature had lavi&s;hly be&s;tow'd all the Graces and Ornaments which could be, to make Humanity ado|rable; &s;he was &s;o nobly endow'd, and &s;o incomparably Beautiful, that to &s;ee her, and not ad|mire her, was impo&s;&s;ible; yet was &s;he capable of all the &s;oft &s;entiments Love could imprint; and had already devoted her Heart to a Man, to whom without blame &s;he might warrantably do, being Prince <HI>Murchoe,</HI> Elde&s;t Son to <HI>Bryan Boriamh,</HI> who was after|wards Elected King of all <HI>Ire|land.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince matchle&s;s in his gallant Exploits, was not le&s;s to be paralell'd in his Love; it is enough to tell you, he &s;aw the beautiful <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> and con&s;e|quently lo&s;t his Heart in the &s;ight; but &s;o much awe did her Vertue create in him, that for &s;ome time
<PB N="6" REF="25">he langui&s;h'd in the Torments of his Flame, without daring to ut|ter one word of his Love; and all the while the charming <HI>Doone|flaith</HI> was &s;ubject to the &s;ame Malady.</P>
<P>Thus for a Time did the&s;e two &s;ecret Lovers live in Hopes that Fortune would at &s;ome time or other, be propitious to their Amours; and altho' they were &s;o enamour'd of each other, yet dar'd not either of them &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;ign of their Pa&s;&s;ion. For now <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to win the Heart of this Lady, and <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> him&s;elf was not the la&s;t who di&s;cern'd it; nor could he any way forbid his Ad|dre&s;s, knowing how dangerous a thing it might prove, to &s;tand in competition with &s;o mighty and powerful a King. <HI>Murchoe</HI> was not in&s;en&s;ible of it, and to his inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief, was forc'd in
<PB N="7" REF="26">&s;ilence to bewail his Misfortunes, and &s;ee all the Joy of his Soul Care&s;s'd and Ador'd by another: What Lamentations and Moans would he make when alone? And what Grief would po&s;&s;e&s;s him, when he fear'd that his charming <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> might in time con&s;ent to the Love of the Tyrant. He became &s;o Melancholy and Trou|bled, that the whole Court cou'd not but take notice of it; and notwith&s;tanding he us'd all endea|vours to &s;tifle his Flame, yet he could not &s;o clo&s;ely conceal it, but <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> (for no Eyes are &s;harper than tho&s;e of the Jealous) perceiv'd it; and under pretence that he &s;u&s;pected him to be Ill inclin'd to his Government, Bani&s;h'd him the Province, which was a far greater Puni&s;h|ment to the young Prince, than had he in&s;tantly doom'd him to Die.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="27"><HI>Dooneflaith</HI> was &s;oon made ac|quainted with the Misfortune of <HI>Murchoe,</HI> in which &s;he took &s;uch part, that &s;he had much ado to refrain falling in a &s;woon before the King, and was forc'd to feign an Excu&s;e to get from his &s;ight; &s;he went &s;lenderly accompa|nied, having but two Maids who kept at a di&s;tance, into a Garden, at the farther end of which was a Grove, who&s;e melancholy &s;hades &s;eem'd fitte&s;t for her Condition; and in which ob&s;curity &s;he might have free Liberty (thinking no body by) to vent her Complaints, while her Women, who &s;eeing her &s;it down on a Bank, retir'd to an Arbour hard by.</P>
<P>It was not without much trou|ble, and many endeavours that &s;he could find utterance for her words, her &s;ighs and &s;obs &s;till hindring her Speech; but at length having by large &s;treams of Tears,
<PB N="9" REF="28">which ran down her Cheeks, al|mo&s;t drain'd the Channels of her Eyes, &s;he began to give ea&s;e to her Heart, which without vent, mu&s;t have certainly bur&s;t.</P>
<Q>Oh! unfortunate and mi&s;e|rable <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> (&s;aith &s;he) whither wilt thou fly for ea&s;e, &s;ince <HI>Murchoe,</HI> the peace of thy Soul is bani&s;h'd thy &s;ight, and who&s;e pre&s;ence was the only &s;tay of my Life; what avails Life, or Eyes to me, now that dear Object's gone?

<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> taking the advantage of <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI>'s Permi&s;&s;ion, went al|&s;o to <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> where he free|ly open'd his Mind, and di&s;cover'd to her all that he had heard from her the day before in the Garden,

<PB N="35" REF="56">the lo&s;s of her lov'd <HI>Murchoe,</HI> catches hold of <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI>'s Arms, by which means &s;he gave <HI>Mur|choe</HI> opportunity to get within him, and di&s;arm him. <Q>Now, Sir (&s;ays <HI>Murchoe</HI>) but that I &s;corn &s;o poor and ba&s;e Revenge, and would not u&s;e the advan|tage given me by a Woman, I'd ea&s;e the Kingdom of its Thraldome, and free my &s;elf from a perfidious Rival.

<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> (with a dauntle&s;s Front) told him how much he was indebted to <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> who had not only Repeal'd his Bani&s;h|ment, but had now given him the advantage over him. He told him withal, how ba&s;e and mean in&s;ulting was; and bid him, &s;ince he was in his power, to u&s;e him as he pleas'd; but charg'd him &s;till to be mindful how he got the Victory &s;o much he boa&s;ted of. <HI>Murchoe</HI> cou'd no longer endure the thoughts of making u&s;e of the Advantage given him again&s;t a &s;ingle Man, threw <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> his Sword, and bid him u&s;e it once more. But <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> ran to him, and with Tears in her Eyes, be&s;ought him to de&s;i&s;t; but nothing could prevail; and had not &s;ome of the Courtiers and

<PB N="38" REF="59">he fled from the Court; but not being willing to leave his Native Soil, by which he knew he &s;hould utterly be depriv'd of all means of &s;erving his Mi&s;tre&s;s; who&s;e ab&s;ence now ran more in his Mind than all his other Mi&s;|fortunes, his Life became in two or three Days &s;o cumber&s;om to him, that he was re&s;olv'd either to lo&s;e it, or free it, together with all <HI>Ireland</HI> of the Tyran|nous Burthen it bore. To which end, he po&s;ts to <HI>Armagh,</HI> where|of <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> was quickly inform'd, and at four &s;everal times in one Month, cau&s;ed Fire to be &s;et to that City, to drive him from thence: Nor did he &s;pare either Mona&s;tery or Church that &s;tood in his way, le&s;t he &s;hould take Sanctuary in them. He likewi&s;e put to Death all their Prie&s;ts, and plac'd Heathen Lay-Abbots in every Cloi&s;ter. Nor did his fury

<P>The poor afflicted <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> &s;pent all her Nights and Days in mo&s;t cruel condolement for the lo&s;s of her <HI>Murchoe;</HI> nor could all the fair Promi&s;es or large Of|fers <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> could make, win her to be&s;tow on him, even to his own Face, any other than the Title of Tyrant; in hopes that thereby &s;he might rai&s;e his Cru|elty to that pitch, as to give her a Death, which next to the Love of her dear <HI>Murchoe,</HI> would now be mo&s;t welcome unto her.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI>'s Love now became &s;o fierce and unruly in his Brea&s;t, that nothing but the Enjoyment of <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> could allay it, or give him one moment of ea&s;e; he re&s;olv'd in him&s;elf, nothing &s;hould <HI>impede</HI> his De&s;ires; where|fore he once more &s;ends to her Fa|ther

<P>Some days pa&s;s'd, and the un|fortunate <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> began to entertain hopes that the Tyrant had quitted his Suit, and that her ill u&s;age of him had bani&s;h'd his Love; &s;he had now time enough to bewail her Misfortunes, and mi&s;s'd not a Day, in which &s;he went not to the Grove in the Garden to ea&s;e her &s;orrowful Heart by Complaints.

<PB N="41" REF="62">an Arbour, where having wea|ried her &s;elf with her Grief, &s;oft &s;lumbers &s;eal'd up her Eyes, and laid her to Sleep, and in her Dreams &s;he imagin'd &s;he &s;aw <HI>Murchoe</HI> all bloody come into her Room, and give her a thou&s;and Reproaches of being unfaithful; then pulling a Sword from under his Robe, he would have pierc'd his own Brea&s;t; at the &s;ight whereof, <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> &s;tarted out of her Sleep, in &s;uch an Agony, that &s;he was not her &s;elf in an hour or two after. But having well con&s;ider'd 'twas only a Dream, and the Fancy of her Di&s;temper'd Brain, &s;he fell to complaining again.</P>
<Q>Oh! mercile&s;s Powers, &s;aid &s;he, how long will you make me the Mark of your Anger? why, O relentle&s;s Heav'ns! are you &s;o Cruel! Oh ea&s;e me of my Mi&s;ery, or Life! For what un|known
<PB N="42" REF="63">Offence do you afflict me thus?

All I reque&s;t, is but one farewell &s;ight of him I love next to your &s;elves; let him but once more ble&s;s my Eyes, and I &s;hall die contented.</Q>
<P>No &s;ooner had &s;he utter'd the&s;e words, but &s;he &s;aw at the entrance of the Arbour, one in a Womans Dre&s;s, who at fir&s;t view &s;he knew not; but recollecting her &s;elf, &s;he perceiv'd to be <HI>Murchoe.</HI> <Q>Thanks, bounteous Heaven, &s;aid &s;he, now my Prayers are heard, this Charitable Act has cancell'd all your former Cruelty; wellcome my Love,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, running to take him in her Arms; but how was &s;he &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him &s;hun

<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> was &s;o a&s;toni&s;h'd at his &s;uddain Happine&s;s, that he could &s;carcely believe what he heard, or &s;aw; and <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> was &s;o much alter'd with her continual Pineing and Grief, that he &s;carce knew her: But his Sen|&s;es a&s;&s;uming their former &s;trength, he ran to her, and fell at her feet, where he vented &s;uch a flood of Tears, and &s;o many Sighs, that he was not able for &s;ome time to utter one word, while the pa&s;&s;i|onate <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> fearing he was
<PB N="44" REF="65">grown unkind, or jealous, fell down by him in a Trance.</P>
<P><HI>Murchoe,</HI> not minding where he was, and what hazard he ran of di&s;covering him&s;elf, and con|&s;equently of lo&s;ing his Life, call'd out for Help, naming him&s;elf a thou&s;and times over, to have been the unfortunate fatal Cau&s;e.</P>
<Q>Oh! <HI>Murchoe, Murchoe,</HI> &s;aid he, what ha&s;t thou done? Oh! I cou'd &s;tab my Heart, tear all my Limbs, and gnaw my very Fle&s;h, for being thus ra&s;h!

Oh ye Inhabitants above, look down, and lend your aid; recall the

<P><HI>Dooneflaith</HI> by this time co|ming to her &s;elf again, gave him a Sign that &s;he liv'd by a Groan. <Q>O ble&s;&s;ed &s;ound, &s;aid he, what Mu&s;ick do&s;t thou make in my Heart! &s;uch a &s;ad accent co|ming from my Love, at any other time, wou'd rend my ve|ry Soul; but now &s;ince 'tis the Me&s;&s;enger of Life, 'tis more Melodious than the Songs of Angels are; repeat it once a|gain, and ble&s;s my Ears.&mdash;Ha! &s;ays <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> where am I? What &s;uper-Officious Hand hath brought me back to Life! What more than &s;avage Bea&s;t, could be &s;o cruel to awake me from my long Eternal Sleep.</Q> But opening her Eyes and &s;eeing <HI>Murchoe,</HI> &s;he alter'd her Note, and gave Heav'n a thou&s;and thanks for their Kindne&s;s, and ask'd

<P>He had yet no power to An|&s;wer, nor wou'd his Ki&s;&s;es per|mit her to fini&s;h what e'er &s;he began, and to their mutual Con|tent and Satisfaction, they &s;pent &s;ome time in the &s;ilent Oratory of their Eyes, where each &s;o feeling|ly did tell &s;uch Stories, as Words cou'd ne'er expre&s;s. <HI>Murchoe</HI> was the fir&s;t who broke &s;ilence, and return'd her a million of Thanks for the intere&s;t &s;he had taken in all that he &s;uffer'd, they made a thou&s;and new Prote&s;tations of Lo|ving till Death, and gave each other firm a&s;&s;urances of future Fi|delity. They were parting, with Promi&s;es to &s;ee each other as often as they could when <HI>Maol&s;eachel|vin</HI> her Father enters, taking <HI>Murchoe,</HI> (not minding his Face, which he took care to conceal,) for one of his Daughters Women, let
<PB N="47" REF="68">him pa&s;s by without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
<P><HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> told <HI>Doonefla|ith</HI> that &s;he mu&s;t prepare, for in three Days he had promis'd <HI>Tur|ge&s;ius</HI> to &s;end her unto him, ac|company'd with fifteen other Virgins, as a Victim to allay the Fury, that her Ob&s;tinacy, and <HI>Murchoe</HI>'s Treachery had rais'd in his Brea&s;t. He &s;tay'd not to receive any An&s;wer, but went forwards to perfect the Walk he intended, and to think of the Pro|ject that was working in his Brain.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he out of &s;ight, but the afflicted <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> be|took her to the Arbour again, and throwing her &s;elf on a Bank, &s;he vented her Sorrow in this man|ner. <Q>Oh Cruel, Barbarous Fa|ther, &s;aid &s;he, and have you at length con&s;ented to a &s;eparation
<PB N="48" REF="69">'twixt me, and my <HI>Murchoe,</HI> to become the Wife of <HI>Turge&s;ius.</HI> But that, I can ea&s;ily hinder.

No, inhuman Parent, tho' you and all the World wou'd grant me His! yet if none el&s;e will, Death &s;hall for|bid the Banes. But if forget|ful of his Oaths, he forces me to Wed him, ev'n in the Ty|rant's &s;ight, I'll Pierce my Heart, and &s;purt the reaking &s;tream full in his hated Face.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> having &s;een <HI>Maol&s;e|achelvin</HI> quit his Daughter, and ob&s;erving her to retire back into the Arbour, follow'd after her, to enquire what her Father had &s;aid. But in what a Con&s;ternation was he? when, as he entred, he beheld her tearing her lovely Hair, and
<PB N="49" REF="70">imprinting the marks of her Rage on her beautiful Face, and giving &s;uch &s;troaks on her tender Brea&s;t, as were enough to force Life from its &s;eat. <HI>Murchoe</HI> ran to her, and put a &s;top to her Hands, which &s;urely el&s;e had ruin'd &s;o much Beauty, as none but &s;he could ever boa&s;t of. <Q>Oh! unkind <HI>Doone|flaith,</HI> &s;aid he to her, what new afflicton has befall'n my Love? that thus &s;he &s;eeks to &s;poil the faire&s;t Temple, Beauty ever fram'd.</Q> <Q>Oh <HI>Murchoe,</HI> replies the de&s;pairing <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> leave me to my &s;elf, my Griefs are catching, and with its black Contagion will infect thy Soul; Heaven has not yet left pouring down its Wrath, and what a|lone was meant for me, may fall on you; the Gods above have mark'd me out a Subject for their utmo&s;t Cruelties! My Father,&mdash;Oh, I blu&s;h to call
<PB N="50" REF="71">him &s;o, forgetting me, forget|ting Honour and him&s;elf, has giv'n me o'er into the Tyrant's Hands; but Three Days time I have allow'd to mourn the lo&s;s of thee my Love, and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<Q>How &s;hort, &s;ays <HI>Murchoe,</HI> and fading are poor Lover's Joys? For but &s;ome Moments &s;ince, I thought my &s;elf in Heaven, and whil&s;t infolded in my <HI>Dooneflaith</HI>'s Arms, I thought no Mi&s;ery cou'd e'er approach me! Then what a Fall is here, flung down at once from that &s;tupendous height, and da&s;h'd in pieces in the lowe&s;t Hell. Oh <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin,</HI> whither is all thy Glory fled?

<P><PB N="51" REF="72">While they were thus condo|ling their hard fortune, and &s;ay|ing all the &s;oft things Love could in&s;pire them with, <HI>Moal&s;eachelvin</HI> returns, and hearing his Daugh|ter's Voice in the Arbour, enter'd, and found our Lovers Arm in Arm, in which po&s;ture they had re&s;olv'd to end their Lives toge|ther, and never part, but go Hand in Hand to Death: Which had not her Father entred, and &s;natch'd the Dagger out of <HI>Mur|choe</HI>'s Hands, had been effected.</P>
<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> &s;eeing <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> could not forbear di&s;covering him|&s;elf to him, and giving him a thou&s;and Reproaches for yielding to the Tyrant's will. <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin</HI> was amaz'd to find him in Company with his Daughter, and in &s;uch a Dre&s;s; but having re|&s;olv'd with him&s;elf what to do, he thought it but Wi&s;dom to con|ceal it till &s;ome fitter Sea&s;on.
<PB N="52" REF="73">Wherefore not minding what <HI>Mur|choe</HI> &s;aid to him, he ask'd his Daughter, if &s;he had con&s;ider'd well of what he had told her.</P>

<P><HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> could no longer hold out; but running fir&s;t to his Daughter, then doing the like to <HI>Murchoe,</HI> he took them both into his Arms, and wept a flood upon their Necks. <Q>Right virtuous Pair, &s;aid he, whom Heaven has &s;ent to make me happy in my latter days, my loving Chil|dren both; forgive the Tryal I have made; Now witne&s;s for me all ye ble&s;s'd above, I hold ye equally as dear as Life, as Ho|nour, or my precious Soul; and &s;ince I find &s;o well you Love each other, curs'd be that Man
<PB N="61" REF="82">who would untie this Knot: Now wipe your Tears away as I do mine, tho' &s;prung from different Cau&s;es; yours, from your Sorrows, mine, from migh|ty Joy; &s;tifle your Grief, as I conceal my Vengeance.

No, <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> no, Genereus <HI>Murchoe,</HI> I have &s;o contriv'd it, &s;he &s;hall be &s;ent to him, and as he writes to me here (&s;hewing them the Letter wil|lingly,) has al&s;o commanded me to &s;end him Fifteen young Virgins of our Noble&s;t Blood, to &s;lake the burning lu&s;t of his Chief Officers, I'll &s;end them too.

<Q>When you are entred, and they all deep in Wine, frolick and gay, their Bloods all boyl|ing hot, &s;ecure each one his Of|ficer by Death, I'll tru&s;t my Daughter with the Tyrant's Fate; &s;trike home my Girl, and dip thy Dagger to the Hilt, then let him take his fill of Love, Care&s;s and Court thee
<PB N="63" REF="84">then.

<P>They all &s;wore Secrecy, and departed, only <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> and <HI>Murchoe</HI> were not &s;eparated till it was late, but went together into her Chamber, where, to their in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction and mutu|al joy, they Supp'd together, and pa&s;&s;ed away the hours till Bed|time, then <HI>Murchoe</HI> was Con|ducted into an Apartment by him|&s;elf, where he &s;pent that Night on the thoughts of the pa&s;t Days Adventures, and the important
<PB N="64" REF="85">Affairs they were to perform in a &s;hort time after.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Turge|&s;ius,</HI> promi&s;ing according to his Commands, that he had won on his Daughter to obey him; and that as he hop'd for his Kingly Favour hereafter, he would not fail upon the Morrow Night to &s;end her, accompany'd with Fif|teen Virgins more, who were al|&s;o willing to run the &s;ame Fate, and participate of the Joys their Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould receive in &s;o &s;plen|did an Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> was almo&s;t ravi&s;h'd with this News, for certainly no Man ever lov'd, or rather lu&s;ted to the degree he did; he was re|&s;olv'd to have lo&s;t the whole King|dom but he would enjoy her; his eager Joy &s;at heavy on his Heart, for Love is mo&s;t impatient on Crown'd Heads. But finding her
<PB N="65" REF="86">come thus ea&s;ily, he &s;par'd not for any thing that might make her Reception Magnificent. He &s;ent for Fifteen of his Chiefe&s;t Commanders, and told them what a Treatment he had for them. In &s;hort, the whole Court was almo&s;t new model'd, the Rooms adorn'd with Rich Beds, and the mo&s;t Co&s;tly Hangings.</P>
<P>Never was Palace &s;o galantly &s;et out with Gold, Jewels, and Tape&s;try as this, not any thing below the Dignity of Silver, and that curiou&s;ly wrought and Ma&s;|&s;ive, was us'd in any of the Chambers; Cloth of Ti&s;&s;ue was the meane&s;t Furniture they had; the Candle&s;ticks were Gold; &s;o that all the Wealth tho&s;e Sacrilegious <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Heathens had de&s;poil'd the Churches and Mona&s;teries of, with all the Plunder they had ta|ken at Sacking of Towns, and King's Courts, were all now
<PB N="66" REF="87">brought to this Palace; &s;o that it might be &s;aid, That one Spot of Ground, held more Wealth than all <HI>Ireland</HI> be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Nor were the Wines but of the Riche&s;t, and all the variety of Viands which could be procur'd, were &s;ent for to this Place, and every one was employ'd in &s;ome Office or other; and the King, with his Commanders almo&s;t Mad for the arrival of the happy Night, their longing impatience thought that almo&s;t an Age, which was only but twenty four Hours.</P>
<P>The Hour at length arriv'd, and <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> &s;et out with a Noble Train of &s;uppos'd young Virgins, whereof Fifteen of them were of the mo&s;t Hand&s;ome, and yet mo&s;t Stout and Re&s;olute Youths of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well and gloriou&s;ly Dre&s;s'd as Hands, Jew|els, and Art could effect it; each having one or two others to attend
<PB N="67" REF="88">him as his Servant, or Waiting-Woman, in the &s;ame Female Ap|parel, and each a &s;hort Sword un|der his Gown.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> went about a Mile out of his Court to meet them, as &s;oon as he had news of their approach, accompanied with Fif|teen of his Choice&s;t Comman|ders, &s;ome whereof he had &s;ent for out of &s;trong Cities wherein they Commanded, who al&s;o had with them an equal Train of Atten|dants.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t interview of the two Parties, was &s;uch a Sight as might have equal'd, if not exceeded, that of <HI>Alexander,</HI> when he met <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> and her <HI>Amazons</HI> up|on the Banks of the <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eem'd as tho' <HI>Mars</HI> him&s;elf had led the Van of all the other Gods, to meet with <HI>Venus</HI> and the Female Deities.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="89"><HI>Turge&s;ius,</HI> and all who follow'd him, quite forgetting their Gran|deur, and Martial Habitude, de|&s;cended from their &s;hining Gild|ed Chariots, and went to tho&s;e of the Ladies. Nor had <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin</HI> &s;par'd Co&s;t to make his Daughters Equipage more Mag|nificent and Glorious than any that <HI>Ireland</HI> had &s;een before, e&s;pecially that of the Charming <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> which was &s;o Richly Furni&s;h'd, that at a di&s;tance in the glittering Sun-beams it was too Glorious to be lookt upon, and &s;truck a &s;ort of Blindne&s;s in the Spectator's Eyes who beheld it. She was drawn by &s;ix milk white Hor&s;es, Capari&s;on'd with Trappings of Gold, an the Chariot wherein &s;he rode was open, having Rich Embroider'd Curtains held up by young <HI>Cupids,</HI> who &s;eem'd well pleas'd, and &s;miling at the Deity
<PB N="69" REF="90">that they attended; nor were the others much le&s;s &s;umptuous.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, who e're had been to &s;ee the fir&s;t Greeting, could not but have been a&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;o No|ble a Sight. <HI>Turge&s;ius,</HI> (as tho' he had long practis'd the Art of Love) &s;o behav'd him&s;elf, that even <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> was mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, at the great Action &s;he was to perform. However, &s;he &s;eem'd as eager to reveive his Care&s;&s;es, as if &s;he had met with the Man whom her Soul a|dor'd. After &s;ome few Compli|ments had pa&s;s'd on either &s;ide, (the Women having by this time alighted to meet the Men) they all mounted again, the Monarch taking <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> into his own Chariot, and the other Com|manders following his Example, did the like with tho&s;e who came with her.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="91">And now being Pair'd, they &s;et forward for the Court; all the way that they rode, they were diverted by Trumpets and Wind-Mu&s;ick, which in their turns made a Seraphick Harmony. But that which mo&s;t of all Charm'd the Ears of the Warriours, were the &s;oft and melting Expre&s;&s;ions the counterfeit Ladies did u&s;e; which were &s;o ravi&s;hing, and ten|der, that not one of <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI>'s Train but could willingly have wi&s;h'd to have pa&s;s'd by the Ceremony of Supping, and have gone immedi|ately to their Chambers; even <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> him&s;elf thought the time, tho' &s;pent in his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Com|pany but irk&s;om and long, &s;o eager was he to have the &s;weet Charmer in his Embraces.</P>
<P>But Supper being ended, the de&s;cription whereof, would but delay the recital of things more
<PB N="71" REF="92">material, they prepar'd for their Beds, and <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> was led up by the &s;uppos'd Maidens who came with her to the Chamber that was a&s;&s;ign'd for the Mo|narch; He being impatient for the dear happine&s;s his Soul &s;o much long'd for, thought them too tedious in undre&s;&s;ing her, and putting her to Bed; being no longer able to defer the happy moment, di&s;arm'd him&s;elf below, as all the re&s;t of the Comman|ers did, laying their Arms on a Table in the great Hall, went each to his Chamber, expecting the coming of Her he had cho&s;e. But <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> no &s;ooner entred his Room, for he came alone, than he was &s;eiz'd on, and immedi|ately gagg'd, that no out-cry might be made; they had certain|ly kill'd him, had not <HI>Murchoe</HI> interceeded; who told him he now paid him back a Debt that
<PB N="72" REF="93">he ow'd him, ever &s;ince he was &s;o generous to &s;ave his Life formerly from the outrage of his Soldiers and Guards, who were ready to have cut him in pieces, when he fought with him in <HI>Dooneflaith</HI>'s Apartment; in retaliation of which, he wou'd now &s;ave his Life from the threatning Swords of tho&s;e who ju&s;tly thir&s;ted for his Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> was not a little &s;ur|priz'd at the unlook'd for Adven|ture; but above all, at the gallant Genero&s;ity of his Noble Enemy, and incens'd Rival, he would have made him &s;uch an An&s;wer as &s;uited the greatne&s;s of the Act, had he had the liberty of &s;peak|ing. But now his Heart was &s;o troubled at the lo&s;s of <HI>Doone|flaith,</HI> and all his ravi&s;hing hopes were &s;o bla&s;ted, that Life to him was but an unnece&s;&s;ary thing; he began tho' too late, to think
<PB N="73" REF="94">how dearly he mu&s;t pay for his Lu&s;t, and how pompous the So|lemnity had been made for the bringing on his utter De&s;tru|ction.</P>
<P>The thoughts of the lo&s;s of a Crown, came crowding upon him, and he could not but be &s;en&s;ible what a la&s;ting Infamy this Action mu&s;t lay on his blind and incon&s;iderate Credulity. How would he, in his Mind, Cur&s;e the time that he fir&s;t &s;aw that Char|ming Seducer, and now beheld her with more Dete&s;tation and Horror, than heretofore he had done with Love and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t leave him to him|&s;elf, and return to the re&s;t, who (after the &s;eizing <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI>) had no better &s;ucce&s;s than their King, unle&s;s ending a mi&s;erable Life might be accounted &s;ome mitiga|tion of their Misfortunes. The Signal was pre&s;ently given out of
<PB N="74" REF="95">the Court Windows to the &s;mall Army that <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> had brought to the Gates, and all tho&s;e Attendants and Servants who came with his Daughter, were in a readine&s;s to give the On&s;et to tho&s;e in the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> and his Train no &s;ooner ro&s;e from the Table, but the inferior Commanders and Of|ficers were &s;et down to it; each with one of tho&s;e under Women who came with <HI>Dooneflaith;</HI> the Bowls of Wine were going mer|rily about, and the <HI>Danes</HI> (who are potent in <HI>Bacchus</HI>'s Bat|tles) were too bu&s;ie, and the Mu|&s;ick too loud to let them hear <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> when with his Arm'd Men he forc'd his way in|to the Palace; and they were greatly &s;urpriz'd when they &s;aw a whole Band of &s;tout <HI>Iri&s;h-men</HI> well Arm'd enter the Hall. It was now no time to demand
<PB N="75" REF="96">what they meant; for e'er they could &s;carce turn about to &s;ee who they were, they met with their Fate,</P>
<P>A greater Confu&s;ion was never &s;een, the Tables were all over|thrown, and the Blood of the <HI>Danes,</HI> with that of the Grape, promi&s;cuou&s;ly mingled, made a purple Deluge on the Floor; nor was there a <HI>Dane</HI> that Night in the Court, who found not his Death, except <HI>Turge&s;ius</HI> the Ty|rant, who was re&s;erv'd for a more ignominious and mi&s;erable End.</P>
<P>Nor had this Great Underta|king any wor&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in the o|ther parts of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for tho&s;e Towns and Cities who&s;e Gover|nours were &s;lain at the Fea&s;t (more bloody than that of the <HI>Centaurs</HI>) hearing of the lo&s;s of their Commanders and their King, lo&s;t with them their Courage, and
<PB N="76" REF="97">yielded an ea&s;ie Victory to the brave <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who in a &s;hort time after, releas'd the whole Kingdom from the &s;lavi&s;h Tyranny of the <HI>Danes,</HI> to their Lawful Subjection under a Monarch of their own, which was by the con&s;ent of the Nobles plac'd on <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> for the gallant Exploit he had done, for then their Monarchs were Elective, and with good rea&s;on the Choice fell on him.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had thrown off the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Yoak, and were again at Liberty, each enjoying the be|nefit of Peace, which was intro|duc'd by a mo&s;t bloody and furi|ous War. Nor was there a <HI>Dane</HI> left in the whole Country, but &s;uch who they us'd as their Slaves, and put to mean Offices; and tho&s;e who were before &s;o bu&s;ie in demoli&s;hing and burning of Churches and Mona&s;teries, were now employ'd either as Smiths,
<PB N="77" REF="98">Carpenters, or Ma&s;ons, in their Re-building, and the Church-Lands were all re&s;tor'd to their proper u&s;es. The Lay-Abbots whom the <HI>Danes</HI> had plac'd there, were ca&s;t out of the Cloi&s;ters and &s;lain, and the whole Kingdom be|gan once more to Flouri&s;h in Chri&s;tianty, and was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the true Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, e'er we proceed any farther, to give a &s;tep back, and &s;ee what became of our Lo|vers, and the depos'd U&s;urper; who, &s;ome time after his Defeat, was led about the Streets, thro' which &s;o often he had rode in Splen|dor and Triumph, now Manacled, and loaden with Chains, and be|came a &s;coff and deri&s;ion to tho&s;e, o'er whom &s;o lately he Triumph'd, and in this Condition (with a &s;houting throng of the Vulgar) was he conducted to the River <HI>Laugh-Ainme,</HI> into which he was
<PB N="78" REF="99">ca&s;t, and fini&s;h'd a burthen&s;om Life, by being their drowned.</P>
<P>Our two Lovers, had now, as they thought, no other Ob&s;tacle, but the con&s;ent of <HI>Bryan Boriam|he</HI> Father to <HI>Murchoe,</HI> who they hop'd would agree to their Marriage. The Valiant <HI>Murchoe</HI> in that Night's great Action, ha|ving &s;hifted his Womans Apparel, put on the more becoming one of Arms, and flew like Lightning to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Country-men, leaving the care and &s;afeguard of <HI>Doone|flaith</HI> to her Father, and it was &s;ome days e'er he return'd, but to his great mi&s;ery; for now <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> having the pro&s;|pect of a Crown in his &s;ight, and having &s;tomach'd <HI>Bryan</HI>'s denial of their Marriage before, was firmly re&s;olv'd that intere&s;t &s;hould not bring him to con&s;ent to it now. Wherefore going to his Daughter, and taking her into
<PB N="79" REF="100">his Clo&s;et, he Commanded her on her Duty, no longer to think of her Lover; but when <HI>Murchoe</HI> return'd, to u&s;e him as one who was mo&s;t indifferent to her.</P>
<Q>Oh! deare&s;t Sir, &s;ays <HI>Doone|flaith,</HI> can what you &s;ay be true? Can he who &s;av'd my Honour, and redeem'd his mourning Country be thus hard|ly us'd by me! He &s;ave thy Honour, and redeem his Coun|try (replies her Father in an an|gry tone) did you your &s;elf, did I, and all the re&s;t of the brave Princes of this Land, do no|thing? Hear what I &s;ay, and for your life obey me, for what I have de&s;ign'd, no Prayers, or Charms, tho' dre&s;t in the be&s;t Garb of Eloquence, adorn'd with all the Tears and taking Looks thy Beauty can put on, tho' on thy Knees thou follow'&s;t me a|bout, thou &s;halt not &s;hake or
<PB N="80" REF="101">move my fixt re&s;olve. If when <HI>Murchoe</HI> &s;hall return, with ea|ger Joys to run into thine Arms, with frowns and &s;corns avoid his &s;oft Embraces, give him no An&s;wer, but di&s;dainful Looks, or here I &s;wear I'll &s;tab him be|fore thy Face.</Q>
<Q>Oh! Reverend Sir, &s;ays <HI>Doo|neflaith,</HI> recal that cruel Oath; how can you think this Heart, that is all Love, all &s;oft and tender to the noble <HI>Murchoe,</HI> can teach my Face to put on &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e! Cou'd I con&s;ent, to &s;hew my Filial Duty, and obey, my Eyes would &s;oon be|tray my Heart; and tho' my words were cold and all unkind, yet they would &s;hoot &s;uch fiery Darts, as would declare they were but counterfeit; my very Eyes, &s;pight of my be&s;t efforts, would talk and tell the tenders of my Soul; each interrupting
<PB N="81" REF="102">&s;igh I give, will bear no con&s;ort with my Tongue.</Q>
<Q>By Heaven (&s;ays her Father) do as I command, &s;hew but one amorous glance, one heave, one pant, or &s;igh, and I will blind tho&s;e tell-tale Eyes of thine, and give thee truly cau&s;e to &s;igh, by giving him his Death. Sure, Sir (replies the weeping <HI>Doone|flaith</HI>) you cannot mean the thing you &s;peak! You &s;ay it but to try my Love a &s;econd time; which by the Gods is &s;till the &s;ame it was, when in the Gar|den you made the former Te&s;t. No, Minion, &s;ays <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin,</HI> I do it not to try thy Love, which I'm too &s;en&s;ible is true; I do it to revenge his Fa|ther's Scorn, who would not give con&s;ent that he &s;hould Wed thee when I was a private Man, nor &s;hall he now I'm
<PB N="82" REF="103">King; therefore once more ob|&s;erve what I command.</Q>
<Q>And mu&s;t the innocent <HI>Mur|choe,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, who always dear|ly lov'd me, and &s;ought not Heaven with more earne&s;t Pray|ers than he &s;ought me, be pu|ni&s;h'd thus for his unkind Fa|ther's Fault? Oh! Sir, rever&s;e your cruel Doom, if not for his &s;ake, yet for mine, nay for your own; for if I &s;hare an intere&s;t in your Heart, 'twill grieve you &s;ure to &s;ee your only Daughter die, when with one word you may pre&s;erve her Life. What! quit my Love, now after this Mi&s;ery and Trouble we have pa&s;s'd through for it! now grow unkind, when he mo&s;t merits Love! and after all tho&s;e Sacred Oaths and Vows, tho&s;e thou|&s;and Prote&s;tations, which even in your hearing, I have made to
<PB N="83" REF="104">Love him ever, now to re-call that &s;acred Breath, and hurl damnation on my perjur'd Soul.</Q>
<Q>I ask you not, &s;ays he, to break your Vows; but meet him as I now command you, that his proud Father may be humbled, and fall a low Petitioner for the Love he once rejected.</Q>
<Q>A thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings &s;it upon your Head, &s;ays &s;he, and make your Crown more glorious than all your Predece&s;&s;ors were, tho&s;e healing words have cur'd my bleeding heart; now I will call you dear and loving Father, kneel and adore the very ground you go on; u&s;e what &s;everity you plea&s;e again&s;t his Father, but let my <HI>Murchoe</HI> not be put in pain; let me not &s;ee him ra|ther, till his &s;uppliant Father begs your pardon; for certainly to &s;ee him as you bid me, will
<PB N="84" REF="105">prove &s;o fatal, that twill break his Heart.</Q>
<Q>Trifle no more (replies <HI>Maol|&s;eachelvin</HI>) but punctually obey my will, I &s;ee them yonder en|tring the Court; and once more &s;wear, if that you fail in any Point I have enjoyn'd you, you ne'er &s;hall meet him more, but in the Grave.</Q>
<P>After this he left her, and went to his own Chamber; no &s;ooner was he parted, but <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> looking out at the Window, be|held her dear <HI>Murchoe,</HI> with his Father ju&s;t entring the Palace; and not being able to think on the &s;evere Injunctions her Fa|ther had laid on her, without a torrent of Tears, and a thou&s;and imprecations on her unkind Stars. <Q>O barbarous Father, &s;aid &s;he to her &s;elf, more Tyrannous and Cruel to thy Child, than Sa|vage Mon&s;ters are to tho&s;e they
<PB N="85" REF="106">hate; not &s;ee my Love, but with di&s;dainful looks! not give him one kind glance for all his Love! not one kind word of thanks for all his pains! this Cruelty exceeds all precedent! my unkind Speech or Eyes will do the fatal Work, and leave no bu&s;ine&s;s for my Father's Sword! O that &s;ome Angel would in|&s;truct my Love, and tell him that my Eyes and Tongue are Lyars, that my poor Heart bears no con&s;ent to what they &s;ay; tell him I am all over Love, and that my <HI>Murchoe</HI> is more precious to my Soul than all the World be&s;ides.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Murchoe,</HI> and his Father, with &s;everal of his Friends were now come into the outward Court of the Palace, and ca&s;ting his Eyes up to the Window, he beheld his adorable Mi&s;tre&s;s; who no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but withdrew from the
<PB N="86" REF="107">Place, which <HI>Murchoe</HI> thought was done to ha&s;te to him. <Q>Oh! Father (&s;ays he, almo&s;t Exta|&s;ied) look how the Trea&s;ure of my Soul does fly to meet my longing Arms; now all the Blood I've lo&s;t in <HI>Ireland</HI>'s Wars, will largely be Re|warded.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bryan</HI> took &s;uch part in his Sons Tran&s;ports, that he could hardly forbear &s;hedding Tears of Joy. But <HI>Murchoe</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould be out-done in kindne&s;s, made what ha&s;t he cou'd into the Hou&s;e, and at the end of the Hall beheld his fair <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> whom he ran unto with all the &s;peed his Love could make. <Q>Oh! thou charming, &s;oft and lovely Maid, &s;aid the tran&s;ported <HI>Murchoe,</HI> let me upon thy tender Brea&s;t breath the &s;oft langui&s;hments of my o'er flowing Joy!</Q> But how did he &s;tart, and look amaz'd,
<PB N="87" REF="108">when he not only &s;aw &s;he met him not half way, but &s;hun'd his Arms; and after a &s;mall pau&s;e, with gazing Eyes he thus went on.</P>
<P><Q>What, my <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> &s;ays he, are my Embraces loath&s;om grown! What, do&s;t thou turn away the warming Sun-&s;hine of thine Eyes; not one kind look to crown thy <HI>Murchoe</HI>'s Victo|ry, not one &s;oft word to bid him wellcome home!</Q> <HI>Doone|flaith</HI> could no longer turn away her Head, yet was afraid of her Father, who through a &s;ecret place look'd into the Hall, and beheld her with frowns; and fear|ing &s;he &s;hould not perform what he bid her, her Love and &s;he mu&s;t part for ever; ca&s;t &s;o di&s;|dainful and &s;cornful a look upon <HI>Murchoe,</HI> that he clapping his Hand to his Heart, cry'd out, <Q>O Gods! tho&s;e cruel piercing
<PB N="88" REF="109">Eyes have &s;tab'd my Soul, and given me a death my bolde&s;t Enemies could never do.</Q> Then after a little &s;top, he went up to her, and would have taken her by the Hand, but &s;he refus'd it him; <Q>telling him the unkindne&s;s of her Father had de&s;troy'd their Loves, and that now he had fallen from his Promi&s;e, and had com|manded her no more to look on him with Amorous Eyes; in pur&s;uance to who&s;e will, &s;he did from thence forward forbid him to vi&s;it her.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Murchoe,</HI> during her talk &s;tood like one without Motion, nor had he the power to utter one word, till he &s;aw her departing the Hall; but then running 'twixt her and the Door, he fell on his Knees, and beg'd her for her former Love to hear his late&s;t words; but &s;he overcome with the pitiful &s;ight, being no longer able to look on
<PB N="89" REF="110">one in that woful Condition, and one whom contrary to her will, &s;he her &s;elf had made &s;o, return'd him no An&s;wer; but &s;natching her Hand out of his, which e'er &s;he was aware he had &s;eiz'd, without &s;o much as looking back, &s;he went out of the Hall, and left the Di&s;con&s;olate <HI>Murchoe</HI> on his Knees.</P>
<P>He continu'd in that po&s;ture till &s;he was gone out of &s;ight; then ri&s;ing on his Legs again, he drew forth his Sword, and had ended his Life on its Point, had not his Father, and Friends (who expected no le&s;s) &s;tept in and prevented him. <Q>Oh! Cru|el Father, &s;ay he to <HI>Bryan,</HI> this la&s;t unkindne&s;s, out-does all you you have done to me before; why would you have me live, when Life's &s;o great a burden? Were it not better I at once gave up my breath, than live in
<PB N="90" REF="111">lingring pain, and deal it out by &s;ighs!

<P>With much ado at la&s;t, they got him home to his Chamber, but twas not in their power to get him to Eat, or take the lea&s;t refre&s;hment; and it was a long time before his Father could get him to promi&s;e to u&s;e no violence on him&s;elf; to which he would never have con&s;ented, had not <HI>Bryan</HI> told him, he would u&s;e all his Endeavour to alter <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin</HI>'s Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="112">No &s;ooner was his Father gone out of the Room, but he com|manded all who were with him to do the like; and after two or three ha&s;ty turns in the Chamber, he flung him&s;elf on his Bed, where he pour'd out &s;uch Tears, &s;uch Sighs, and Complaints, that he drew moi&s;ture from the Eyes of all who look'd in at the Key|hole of the Door to &s;ee what he did. But now let us return again to our Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Soon after all things were &s;et|tled in Peace, the Victorious <HI>Ma|ol&s;eachelvin,</HI> was as is &s;aid before, by the Election of the Princes and Nobility of <HI>Ireland,</HI> de&s;ervedly made King of <HI>Meath,</HI> and then Monarch of the whole Country; when there arriv'd three Brothers out of <HI>Norway,</HI> viz. <HI>Amelanus, Cytaracus,</HI> and <HI>Ivorus,</HI> with their Families, and great Trains, who (in a mo&s;t Amicable and Peace|able
<PB N="92" REF="113">manner) pretending to be Merchants, obtain'd leave for the better carrying on their Traffick and Trade, to build three Cities near the Sea &s;ide; which was per|mitted them, upon Condition, that they paid Tribute for them. Articles of Agreement being con|&s;ented too, on both &s;ides, they fell to Work, and erected the three Cities, now call'd <HI>Dublin, Wa|terford,</HI> and <HI>Limrick;</HI> which they had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, and had made almo&s;t impregnable by &s;trong Fortifications, but the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> began to &s;ee their Error, and now it was that they felt the Power of an Enemy, no le&s;s prejudicial in all appearance, than that they had lately &s;ubdu'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sea-port Towns giving entrance to fre&s;h and numerous Fleets of <HI>Norwegians, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Oo&s;tmans;</HI> in&s;omuch that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were forc'd once more to
<PB N="93" REF="114">have recour&s;e to their Arms. And here it was that <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI>'s Heart became mollified, and once more gave con&s;ent (when the Kingdom &s;hould be freed of its Foes) that <HI>Murchoe</HI> &s;hould Marry his Daughter.</P>
<P>The two Lovers had now ad|mittance to &s;ee each other, and with a bleeding Heart the Charming <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> made known to her dear <HI>Murchoe</HI> the rea&s;on why &s;he us'd that &s;everity to him at his return from the former Battle: <HI>Murchoe</HI> lov'd too well to think any of the fault was on her &s;ide, and was now the mo&s;t happy Man in the World. Her Father, the King, made him his General, but the Occa&s;ion was urgent, and he was ha&s;ted away, having &s;carce time to take his Leave.</P>
<P>However, he had with a thou|&s;and &s;oft and pa&s;&s;ionate Speeches already parted with <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="115">and was now come to <HI>Maol&s;each|elvin,</HI> who receiv'd him with all the expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s that could be. <Q>Go Valiant Youth, &s;ays the King to him, go, and return Crown'd with Laurels of Victory; revenge the hard U&s;age you have &s;uffer'd, on tho&s;e barbarous Infidels; for|give my Ra&s;hne&s;s, and believe I now &s;et no difference betwixt thee and my own Child. No, my dear Son, for &s;o henceforth I will call thee, and tho' your Father &s;hun all my Advance|ments, I thus will embrace his Son. Go then, Victorious <HI>Murchoe,</HI> Head our Men; my chearful Soldiers long to &s;ee their Chief, they think the time you lo&s;e in my embraces, an Age, in their impatience.</Q></P>
<Q>Now mighty Monarch, &s;ays <HI>Murchoe</HI> to him, you &s;how'r &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings on my Head,
<PB N="95" REF="116">give me &s;uch Courage, and &s;uch Hopes, that if I Conquer not, let me hereafter bear the Cow|ard brand; the Power you give me, united with the thoughts of my <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> &s;hall make me Conqueror where e'er I go, and &s;weep your numerous Ene|mies from off the Earth.</Q>
<P>After many endearing Di&s;cour|&s;es, <HI>Murchoe</HI> took Hor&s;e, and went to the Army, who wellcom'd him with loud &s;houts of Joy; and where he found &s;uch Stout and Re&s;olute <HI>Iri&s;h-men,</HI> that where-ever he came, he carried Victory on his Sword's Point; while his Father <HI>Bryan</HI> no le&s;s fearing the lo&s;s of the Kingdom again, in the Southern parts of the Country did &s;uch things as would almo&s;t &s;eem incredible, and in a &s;hort time was Crown'd King of <HI>Mun|&s;ter,</HI> &s;till Conquering where e'er he went, and &s;oon after &s;ubdu'd
<PB N="96" REF="117">one half of the Nation. Nor did he put a &s;top to his irre&s;i&s;table Force, till he was publickly E|lected, and made Monarch of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Nobility and Princes depo&s;ing <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> to make way for <HI>Bryan,</HI> giving him leave to live, which is the greate&s;t mi|&s;ery that can befall a Monarch af|ter the lo&s;s of a Diadem.</P>
<P><HI>Bryan</HI> now being King of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> thought him&s;elf &s;uffici|ently reveng'd for the &s;lights which <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> had put on his Son, and commanded <HI>Mur|choe</HI> to come home to his Palace, which then he kept at <HI>Tomond,</HI> to the un&s;peakable trouble and af|fliction of the two Lovers, who now were taking, as they fear'd, their la&s;t leaves of each other.</P>
<Q>Oh! my adorable Saint, &s;ays the afflicted <HI>Murchoe</HI> to <HI>Doone|flaith,</HI> how unfortunate have all my Undertakings been! How
<PB N="97" REF="118">Cruel is my Fate; that now, when I thought my Happine&s;s beyond the reach of any Mi&s;|fortune, I find it da&s;h'd, by that which I hop'd would have been its chief &s;tay.

Oh! in&s;upport|able Cruelty, I mu&s;t leave my Love! leave her, (good Heavens defend,) I fear for ever; But witne&s;s Gods, and all you Saints above, though ab&s;ent from my &s;ight I'll ne'er forget thee; Hopes, (once to ble&s;s me with thy &s;ight again,) &s;hall buoy me up through all my Sea of Sorrows, if my dear Love but promi&s;e to be con&s;tant.&mdash;</Q>
<P><HI>Dooneflaith</HI> could not hear him make &s;uch a &s;cruple, without &s;hewing how much it touch'd her Heart. <Q>Oh, cruel <HI>Murchoe!</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="119">&s;aid &s;he, do you take part a|gain&s;t me! And if I will be con&s;tant!

<P><Q>No more, &s;ays <HI>Murchoe,</HI> I believe my Saint, and ever &s;hall retain the&s;e precious words in the chief Records of my memo|ry.</Q> They were forc'd &s;oon af|ter this to part; but with &s;uch langui&s;hing and dying looks, as if they ne'er &s;hould meet again: how many times did <HI>Murchoe</HI> go to the Door, and then return
<PB N="100" REF="121">again, loath to depart, printing his &s;oft Lips on her fair Hand, and &s;he as often wi&s;h'd they might dwell there for ever; they &s;ighed, and wept, then wiped their watry Cheeks, making ex|change of Hearts at eithers Eyes; at la&s;t, as though both their words had been prompted by one Soul, they together cry'd, the Gods pre&s;erve, and ever be your Com|fort.</P>
<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> having taken his leave, went directly, but mo&s;t heavily, towards his Fathers Palace in <HI>Tomond,</HI> call'd <HI>Cean-Choradh,</HI> where he was welcom'd by <HI>Bry|an,</HI> and the whole Court; but what were all the welcomes in the World to him, &s;ince his <HI>Doo|neflaith</HI>'s Voice was wanting in the Con&s;ort, the Mu&s;ick was not &s;weet or charming, he wholly bent his Thoughts on her, and
<PB N="101" REF="122">Day or Night, &s;he was the &s;ub|ject of his Mind; tho' he was ever accounted Devout, yet now the welfare and happine&s;s of his afflicted Mi&s;tre&s;s, threw him on his Knees almo&s;t each hour.</P>
<P>His Father, and the whole Court could not but greatly wonder at this mighty Change; he grew Pale, neglected Meat, and Sleep, walk'd all the Day in melancholy places, &s;eeking rece&s;&s;es, where the hunted Bea&s;ts &s;carce dar'd to enter, they were &s;o dark and di&s;|mal; where, with his folded Arms acro&s;s his troubled Brea&s;t, he'd vent the Griefs which rankled at his Heart.</P>
<P>Into one of the&s;e Places was it, that his Father one day follow'd him, and having privately li&s;tned to his u&s;ual Complaints, when the poor Prince had thrown him|&s;elf down, extended on a rugged
<PB N="102" REF="123">Rock, his Eyes (like Rivers which had broke their Banks) pour'd forth a flood of Tears, with Groans and Sighs, which almo&s;t rent the Vault.</P>
<Q>How Happy, &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, had <HI>Murchoe</HI> been, had Heaven been pleas'd he &s;hould have peri&s;h'd in his Countries Ser|vice, his lo&s;s perhaps would then have touch'd his Fathers hardned Heart; he would have then perhaps &s;hed one Tear, and with a &s;igh, have pitty'd his untimely End: But now he thinks I breath, he thinks I live; when as, alas! the&s;e &s;igns I give of Life, are but the To|kens of unea&s;ie Death; for I am Dead to all the World, in&s;en|&s;ible of every thing, but Love; and tho' I move, and &s;ometimes walk about, 'tis but my more &s;ub&s;tantial Gho&s;t.&mdash;</Q>
<P><PB N="103" REF="124">He was going on, when <HI>Bryan</HI> interrupted him: <Q>What <HI>Mur|choe,</HI> &s;aid he, is the Cau&s;e that thus thou &s;pende&s;t thy Youthful time in Cells? Thus pine, and like a Woman drown thy &s;elf in Tears? Thus leave the migh|ty Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World, and bend thy Thoughts on a fanta|&s;tick Trifle? Thus &s;hun thy Friends, and &s;eek the&s;e &s;olitary Shades? Rouze up, for &s;hame, awake thee from the&s;e Idle Dreams; thy Father bids thee, and a King Commands, thy bleeding Country wants thy aid: Ambition &s;hould methinks inflame thy Heart, and bani&s;h Love from that too noble Seat.

<Q>O &s;acred Sir, replies the Prince, can you behold the&s;e ruines of your Son? Look on, and &s;ee him &s;ink in &s;orrow, and not extend a Parent's Hand to help him? O Sir, remember you your &s;elf was young, Lov'd and Ador'd, and knew no hap|pine&s;s but in my Mothers &s;ight: I do but tread your &s;teps, walk in that Path which all the World goes once; &s;ay but <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> &s;hall be mine, and you will rai&s;e me unto Life again; without Her, Honour, Titles, Pow|er, nay even a Crown it &s;elf,

<P><HI>Bryan</HI> could no longer hear him &s;ue in vain; but told him, if he would take Arms, and &s;hew him&s;elf once more in the Field, and, according to his wonted Cu|&s;tom, come home laden with Vi|ctory, he would &s;o much indulge his Love, that, if after this, he &s;till continued in that Humour, he'd u&s;e his utmo&s;t Power to make him Happy.</P>
<P>The Prince overjoy'd with this Promi&s;e, went home with his Fa|ther, and in a few days after, Headed a brave Army again&s;t his Country's Enemies; Victory &s;till follow'd where&s;oe'er he fought, and his Courage and Conduct were not a &s;mall cau&s;e of the Re|nown and Glory that accru'd to his Father: For 'tis Remarkable, that <HI>Bryan Boraimh</HI> defeated the
<PB N="106" REF="127"><HI>Danes</HI> and their Confederates in Twenty five bloody pitch'd Bat|tles; he was accounted one of the mo&s;t Pui&s;&s;ant and Noble Mo|narchs of the <HI>Mile&s;ian</HI> Race; and tho' he liv'd not to &s;ee the&s;e Inva|ders quite expell'd the Kingdom, yet he fought in the la&s;t Battle, that gave them their Overthrow; having in his Life time reduc'd the Kingdom (e&s;pecially towards the latter end of his Reign) to &s;o tranquil and quiet a State, that <HI>Ireland</HI> was become all peaceable and flouri&s;hing. Nor were there to be &s;een any <HI>Danes,</HI> but &s;uch who liv'd quietly under his Go|vernment, and were either Mer|chants, Handycrafts-men, or Ar|tificers, who had their chief Re|&s;idence in <HI>Dublin, Weixford, Wa|terford, Cork,</HI> or <HI>Limerick;</HI> and tho' they were a con&s;iderable Number of them, yet not &s;o ma|ny,

<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> &s;eeing no Comfort ac|crue to him in all this general Joy, for he alone was excluded the benefit of Tranquility the whole Nation pertook, the Con|que&s;ts and Honour he won, added more Trouble to his Soul, &s;ince he could not yet obtain his Fa|ther's Con&s;ent, he avoided as much as he could the Plea&s;ures of the Court, and betook him&s;elf wholly to the Country, where, in un&s;peakable Torments, he wa|&s;ted his time in Complaints.

<P>While Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent over into <HI>Denmark,</HI> he returns Home again; where (with all the ha&s;t he could u&s;e, and mo&s;t inde|fatigable pains) he prepares for a
<PB N="114" REF="135">War; nor was it long e'er he goes to <HI>Dublin</HI> again; where, at his arrival, two of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Sons (<HI>Carolus Knu|tus,</HI> and <HI>Andreas</HI> his Brother) Landed, at the Head of twelve thou&s;and <HI>Danes,</HI> which they had brought along with them, whom (after he had kindly receiv'd, and refre&s;h'd them well) he forth|with, knowing delays in &s;uch Ca|&s;es would be dangerous, and give his Enemies too much time to Unite) by an Herald &s;ends <HI>Bryan</HI> a bold Defiance, daring him to meet him in a &s;pacious Field at <HI>Clantarf,</HI> within two Miles of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bryan</HI> had no &s;ooner receiv'd this Challenge; but (making what &s;peed he was able) joyn'd together all the Forces of <HI>Mun&s;ter, Connaught,</HI> and <HI>Meath,</HI> for tho&s;e of <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> he &s;ent not to them,
<PB N="115" REF="136">being unwilling to &s;tay till they &s;hould come up; and believing he had Power enough out of tho&s;e other three Provinces to encoun|ter the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Murchoe</HI> his Son was &s;ent to tho&s;e in <HI>Meath,</HI> where he once more got a &s;ight of his charming <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> and whom (after the &s;ucce&s;s of the Battle) he had a Promi&s;e from <HI>Bryan</HI> his Fa|ther, that he &s;hould Marry.</P>
<P>Never did two faithful Lovers meet with &s;uch Joy, and <HI>Doone|flaith</HI> even ble&s;t the Cau&s;ers of this War, which had made her &s;o happy with the pre&s;ence of her dear <HI>Murchoe. Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> tho' depos'd from the Monarchy, had great Intere&s;t in the Province of <HI>Meath,</HI> and &s;oon rais'd &s;uch For|ces, as perchance none el&s;e could have done; which <HI>Bryan</HI> under|&s;tanding, made him General of
<PB N="116" REF="137">that part of the Army, and &s;ent for his Son back to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But if the Meeting of this A|morous Pair was &s;o full of Joy and Content, yet their Parting was &s;uch as is not to be expre&s;s'd; they took their leaves of each other, with &s;uch unwillingne&s;s, and regret, that their Separation &s;eem'd to have rent their Hearts a&s;under.</P>
<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> was not altogether &s;o overwhelm'd as he had formerly been, &s;ince his Hopes now &s;tood fair, in a few days, to Crown all his Sufferings with the enjoyment of his Charming <HI>Dooneflaith:</HI> But the di&s;con&s;olate Fair-One, felt &s;uch Pangs, at his taking his leave, as gave tho&s;e who &s;tood by (e&s;pecially her Father) cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect they were but too fatal Omens. And he being willing they &s;hould have all the liberty
<PB N="117" REF="138">the little time he had too &s;ee her, to &s;ay what they pleas'd privately together, he withdrew, and left them to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now it was that <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> vented the tenders of her Soul in &s;uch a manner, that <HI>Murchoe</HI> him|&s;elf could hardly &s;tay with her, to hear the Complaints which &s;he made of her hard De&s;tiny. <Q>Oh <HI>Murchoe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you are go|ing to leave me for ever; I have &s;omething here at my Heart, that prompts my Soul to think <HI>Murchoe</HI> will never re|turn to his <HI>Dooneflaith</HI> again, my pre&s;aging Heart fore-bodes, that the Victory which you are going to win, will be cau&s;e of Joy to all <HI>Ireland,</HI> but my unfortunate &s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Murchoe</HI> us'd all Arguments that could be thought of, to di&s;&s;ipate her Fears; <Q>And told her, that
<PB N="118" REF="139">his Courage, guarded by the hopes of her Love, would make him do things that &s;hould fill the Trumpet of Fame to the end of the World. I go, my Charming <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> &s;ays he, to &s;et this Kingdom in Peace, that &s;o I with the more free|dom may quietly enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ing the Gods would be&s;tow at the end of the Conque&s;t; and that <HI>Ireland</HI> might be &s;o &s;et|tled, that he no more might have cau&s;e to quit her &s;oft Arms to follow the Wars.</Q></P>
<Q>Go <HI>Murchoe,</HI> (reply'd &s;he, with &s;uch langui&s;hing looks, and &s;o dying a tone as almo&s;t made him alter his firm Re&s;olu|tion;) Go and fight for thy Country, Go and Conquer, Go and&mdash;(I would fain &s;ay) return again to my Arms: But&mdash;Oh! &s;omething here at my Heart
<PB N="119" REF="140">will not let me believe the Hea|vens will make me &s;o Happy. No, my <HI>Murchoe,</HI> the&s;e Eyes will never behold thee again; and the next Embrace thou ha&s;t, will be that cold one of Death. Methinks I &s;ee my deare&s;t <HI>Murchoe,</HI> all pale and cold, &s;tuck through with a thou|&s;and Darts and Arrows; his breathle&s;s Corps &s;purting fre&s;h &s;treams of Blood; when I, un|happy I, come by, who am his Murderer.</Q>
<Q>No more my Charmer, &s;ays <HI>Murchoe</HI> to her, drive the&s;e idle Thoughts away, they are but Dreams which will di&s;turb thy Re&s;t; I &s;hall return, I know it by my Heart; (Oh! that I did, &s;aid he to him&s;elf,) Or &s;ay I dy'd, I paid but Nature's Debt, what you and I, and all mu&s;t do at la&s;t; my Fall &s;hall
<PB N="120" REF="141">not be mean, and thou&s;ands bra|ver Men &s;hall bear me Com|pany. Oh! <HI>Dooneflaith,</HI> what Comfort will it be, how will it &s;often Death, and blunt its &s;harpe&s;t Dart, to think I die be|lov'd by thee!</Q>
<P>While they were Embracing, in order to Part, <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> came in, and told him he mu&s;t make all ha&s;t po&s;&s;ible with his Forces, for all the others which they expected were come in but his.</P>
<P>The Prince, as eager as he was to meet his proud Challenger, and not think of leaving his Mi&s;tre&s;s behind; wherefore, by her Con|&s;ent, and joint intreaty, <HI>Maol&s;ea|chelvin</HI> promis'd to bring her with him; this at la&s;t &s;omething appeas'd the Sorrow of both; and <HI>Murchoe,</HI> after a thou&s;and &s;oft Ki&s;&s;es, and Embraces, and as
<PB N="121" REF="142">many Sighs, and Tears on both &s;ides, took Hor&s;e, and po&s;ted be|fore to his Father, and the next day after <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> follow'd with his Army; and at the Rear of that, the beautiful <HI>Doone|flaith.</HI></P>
<P>In a few days after, the Armies of the three Provinces joyn'd all together, and march'd in good order to the Place appointed, be|ing a &s;pacious Field near <HI>Clan|tarfe,</HI> call'd <HI>Magnealta,</HI> where they beheld <HI>Maolmordh</HI> at the Head of a va&s;t Army; being &s;ix|teen Thou&s;and <HI>Danes,</HI> together with all the Forces he could rai&s;e in <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> which was divided into three Battalions; that of the Right Wing Commanded by <HI>Carolus Knutus,</HI> that on the Left by his Brother <HI>Andreas,</HI> (the two Sons of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> King) and the Main Body <HI>Maolmordh</HI> took care of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="143"><HI>Bryan</HI> drew up his Army much after the &s;ame Order, committing the Right Wing thereof to <HI>Maol|&s;eachelvin,</HI> the Left he Com|manded him&s;elf; and (at the in|treaty of his Son <HI>Murchoe,</HI> that he might oppo&s;e <HI>Maolmordh</HI> him|&s;elf, who had given him a Chal|lenge) the main Body was under his Conduct.</P>
<P>Early next Morning (it being <HI>Good Friday</HI>) both Armies drew near, and after a &s;hort time the fatal Signal was given on both &s;ides, never did two Armies en|counter more fiercely; the &s;houts and cries, with the Thunder|ing noi&s;e of the Drums and, &s;ound of Trumpets, were enough to rend the very Roof of Heaven. Nor for half the Day could it be decided upon which &s;ide hover|ing Victory would light; and had <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> (who Headed the Army of <HI>Meath</HI>) came up, they
<PB N="123" REF="144">had &s;oon turn'd the Scale. But he, remembring the Affront of <HI>Bryan,</HI> who made him be De|pos'd, to make way for him&s;elf, as &s;oon as the Signal was given, &s;tood off with his Men, and was only a Spectator of the mo&s;t bloody and terrible Fight that ever was Acted on the Tragick Theatre of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ground. Nay, tho' at one time he &s;aw his own Country-men begin to give way, and the <HI>Danes</HI> in a probability of winning the Day, yet did he &s;tand unmov'd.</P>
<P><HI>Bryan</HI> who Headed the Left Wing of the Army, being Old (for he was now above four&s;core and eight) having to do with <HI>Carolus,</HI> who was both Valiant and Young, was in the Battle &s;truck from his Hor&s;e, and had not Prince <HI>Murchoe</HI> come timely to his Re&s;cue, he had been trod
<PB N="124" REF="145">to pieces by the Enemy; which ne|verthele&s;s &s;o bruis'd and wound|ed him, that he was forc'd to be carry'd to his Tent, leaving the Charge of his Army to Prince <HI>Murchoe.</HI></P>
<P>Now was the time that he had the whole Fate of <HI>Ireland</HI> de|pending upon his Sword, he did &s;uch wondrous Actions as &s;ur|pa&s;s'd all belief, and &s;o bravely behav'd him&s;elf, as tho' he had been &s;ome God &s;ent down from above. He (&s;pight of all their Forces, thinking of the Liberty of his Country, and Love of his dear <HI>Dooneflaith</HI>) made &s;uch breaches in their Main Body, that not|with&s;tanding they had all the In&s;piration of Courage, that Martial-Conduct, Ambition, Glory, Revenge, and De&s;pair could afford them, yet &s;o great was <HI>Murchoe</HI>'s Courage, and
<PB N="125" REF="146">Conduct &s;o happy, that the <HI>Da|ni&s;h</HI> and <HI>Lein&s;ter</HI> Forces could no longer with&s;tand him; having with his own Hand fir&s;t &s;lain <HI>Maolmordh,</HI> who was the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of this War; and then at two &s;everal times the two Sons of the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> who&s;e Lo&s;s &s;o di&s;heartned the Enemy, that they gave way, to an ea&s;ie, though dear-bought Victory; for <HI>Murchoe</HI> being too far engag'd among the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, tho' over-power'd with Number, fought 'till he had made a Ram|part of dead Bodies about him, which for &s;ome time &s;ecur'd him from Fate; but an unlucky acci|dental Arrow laid him dead up|on a Pyramid of his fallen Ene|mies.</P>
<P>Yet for all this, did not the re&s;olute <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> loo&s;e one foot of Ground, or one bit of their Cou|rage;
<PB N="126" REF="147">but rather, &s;pur'd on by Revenge, made the <HI>Danes</HI> pay dear for his Lo&s;s, and in a &s;hort time became &s;ole Ma&s;ters of the Field. Thus without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> were the <HI>Danes</HI> overcome; one whereof, who&s;e Name was <HI>Bruador,</HI> be|ing Commander of a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Party, and who with his Men flying in the General Rout, was forc'd to take that way where <HI>Bryan</HI> the Monarch's Pavi|lion was pitch'd; into which (as he was pa&s;&s;ing by) he en|tred; and &s;eeing the King, whom he had formerly known, <HI>Bryan</HI> &s;u&s;pecting no &s;uch thing, having totally gain'd the Battle, ba&s;ely Murder'd him as he lay wounded in his Bed: But he &s;oon had the Reward due to &s;o Trea|cherous an Act; for he, and all who follow'd him, were by his
<PB N="127" REF="148">Guards, and the Pur&s;uers, cut all to pieces.</P>
<P><HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI> after this, put in for his Share, and made him|&s;elf once more Monarch of <HI>Ire|land.</HI> Tho' his Daughter no &s;ooner heard the Death of her Lover, but as though &s;he had lain down to Sleep, flung her &s;elf on her Bed, and without &s;o much as one Groan, Sigh, or Murmur, &s;he cry'd, <HI>My</HI> Mur|choe <HI>calls me, and I mu&s;t go to him;</HI> &s;o dy'd in the pre&s;ence of her Father, and the re&s;t of the Nobility, who had e&s;cap'd in the Battle, for there were but few left alive: and on the Mo|narch's Side, be&s;ides <HI>Bryan</HI> him|&s;elf, and the Renowned Prince <HI>Murchoe</HI> his Son, were kill'd in this Battle, Seven petty Kings, mo&s;t of the Princes and Nobi|lity of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Conaught,</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="149">and four Thou&s;and of meaner Degree.</P>
<P>But on the other &s;ide, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Lein&s;ter</HI> Party, were Slain <HI>Maolmordh Mac-Murchoe,</HI> the King of <HI>Lein|&s;ter,</HI> who was the Original Cau&s;e of this Slaughter, with all his Principal Nobles, and three Thou|&s;and Common Soldiers; toge|ther with <HI>Knutus,</HI> and <HI>Andreas,</HI> the two Sons of the King of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> and all their Great Com|manders, with &s;ix Thou&s;and &s;e|ven Hundred of the New-come Forces from <HI>Denmark,</HI> that they had brought over with them, and four Thou&s;and of the old <HI>Danes,</HI> who were, before their coming, in <HI>Ireland.</HI> In all the Slaughter on both Sides, that Day, amount|ed to &s;even Thou&s;and &s;even Hun|dred Men, be&s;ides Kings, Prin|ces, Commanders, and other No|ble-Men.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="150">Some time after this Battle, <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> (who now the &s;econd time &s;at on the Monar|chical Throne of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was the la&s;t Monarch of the <HI>Mi|le&s;ian</HI> Race) took <HI>Dublin,</HI> Sack'd it, Burnt it, and Slew in it all tho&s;e <HI>Danes</HI> who had made their e&s;cape thither from the Battle of <HI>Clantarfe.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year, in the &s;aid <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin</HI>'s Reign, <HI>Huag|haire Mac-Duniling Mac-Tuatil,</HI> another King of <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Maolmordh,</HI> tho' of a more Noble Race, and better In|tere&s;ted for the Good of his Country, gave a mighty over|throw, (which was the la&s;t that was given) to <HI>Stetirick</HI> the Son of <HI>Aomlaibh,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> of <HI>Dublin,</HI> who after the Battle of <HI>Clantarfe,</HI> and the Burning of <HI>Dublin</HI> by <HI>Maol&s;eachelvin,</HI> had
<PB N="130" REF="151">once more Recruited from the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> and other I&s;lands, which were yet in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> but were now totally de&s;troy'd throughout all <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did that Warlike and An|cient Kingdom free it &s;elf from the Tyranny of its mortal Enemy the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
