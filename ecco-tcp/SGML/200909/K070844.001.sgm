<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author does not mean, by a Pre|face, to make fa&s;hionable unmean|ing apologies for intruding his thoughts on the Public. If there is any obligation on either &s;ide, the world is certainly as much obliged to him for his Book as he can be to them for reading it. Authors &s;urely de&s;erve, at lea&s;t, thanks as well as critici&s;m from their country for their la|bours. But thanks and compliments are here out of the que&s;tion. The common cant of per&s;onal politene&s;s is not <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> in this ca&s;e. Though he feels him&s;elf high|ly honoured and obliged by many re&s;pecta|ble individuals; the Public is not an in|dividual, to be wheedled like a child, or &s;oothed like a tyrant; but &s;hould certainly be treated with truth and &s;incerity, which deal not in compliments, and &s;eldom re|quire apologies.</P>
<P>Though it can little concern the world to know whether this corre&s;pondence was
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
originally intended for publication, the Writer thinks proper to mention that, having re&s;ided abroad, at different periods of life, and in &s;ituations that gave him occa&s;ion to &s;ee more of Spain, and &s;ome other countries, than has u&s;ually fallen to the lot of travellers, he was thence led to ob&s;erve and reflect, perhaps with a more continued attention than ordinary, on the people, their arts, police, character, and above all, on the &s;tate of &s;ociety, and the great art of government, on which depend &s;o much of the progre&s;s, civiliza|tion, and happine&s;s of mankind. Some of his remarks having been communicated to friends and relations, they have thought the following worth pre&s;erving by publica|tion.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a corre&s;pondence, great inequali|ties, and want of &s;trict connection, mu&s;t be expected: regularity and &s;y&s;tem were not intended. The Author has digre&s;&s;ed to a variety of &s;ubjects, as the different views in travelling brought them before him, and has indulged in reflections which &s;eemed
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
then of importance. Some of them may &s;till appear new, others perhaps intere&s;ting to many, and even the mo&s;t &s;ingular may be acceptable to &s;ome readers; for, it is imagined that, by following only his own ideas and opinions, he is the more likely to be original, and different from other letter-writters of the &s;ame kind. He only pretends to give a few hints or &s;ketches of what might be &s;aid on the various &s;ubjects and nations here mentioned, nor does he always pre&s;ume to decide on conte&s;ted or probable opinions. Much more might doubtle&s;s be ob&s;erved in another journey to the &s;ame countries. In many &s;ubjects, all our attempts towards truth and know|ledge can form, at be&s;t, perhaps only a perpetual and indeterminate approxima|tion.</P>
<P>Without attempting to improve much upon the carele&s;s &s;tyle and freedom of private letters, he has here endeavoured &s;omewhat to correct and arrange them, and to make &s;ome additions from recollec|tion,
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
and other information. To any un|common degrees of elegance he forms no preten&s;ions, and aims only at being under|&s;tood. Some degree of negligence indeed as to &s;tyle, or at lea&s;t fine &s;tyle, he con|fe&s;&s;es may be rather intentional, from a love of brevity and &s;implicity, and from a di&s;inclination to join in the growing affect|ation of the age, the real improvement of which he is more &s;olicitous to promote, than he is ambitious of its prai&s;e; and wi&s;hes to &s;ee a greater importance and at|tention given to u&s;eful knowledge, than to any tumid or pedantic manner of writ|ing, which he thinks neither &s;uitable to the character of the nation, nor of their lan|guage. In writing to different people, from the &s;ame country, the &s;ame &s;ubjects mu&s;t frequently recur, which he has here endeavoured to avoid.</P>
<P>But, after all, if a few repetitions, or rather returns of the &s;ame ideas, though in different terms and points of view, or if any inaccuracies of language, and ten|dency
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
to foreign idioms, &s;hould &s;till remain, it is hoped his greater attention to the mat|ter than the manner will be admitted as &s;ufficient apology.</P>
<P>The&s;e journies were undertaken, &s;ome on bu&s;ine&s;s, others from plea&s;ure and curio|&s;ity. The fir&s;t, to Barbary, was an em|ba&s;&s;y from General Cornwallis, governor of Gibraltar, to the Emperor of Moroco, on various public bu&s;ine&s;s, in which the Author had the plea&s;ure of &s;ucceeding to the &s;atisfaction of all parties.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER I.</HI> Arrival at Tetuan, and at La Rache.&mdash;Of the Moors.&mdash;Of the Prince Muley Ali Acid.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>La Rache,
<DATE>Nov. 1771.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OF this little African journey, or em|ba&s;&s;y, which we have undertaken, and at length begun, I do not mean to trouble you with very circum&s;tantial accounts&mdash;nor with de&s;criptions, itineraries, or journals, nor perhaps with any thing in
<PB N="2" REF="14">
the u&s;ual &s;tyle of Travels: a few detached ob&s;ervations on the people, with &s;uch re|flections as I may think worth your notice, will probably be the chief amount of what you have to expect: <HI>et tout a ma fa&ccedil;on,</HI> retaining always the liberty to &s;top at any place I plea&s;e, and digre&s;s to any &s;ubject that may come near my way, or &s;eem connected with it:&mdash;but all as time and occa&s;ion may chance to &s;uit: the na|tural uncertainty of all human hopes &s;eems to increa&s;e as we advance upon this dreary continent: you mu&s;t take the little I can give, and be thankful. If we could re&s;train the minutene&s;s of modern trifling curio|&s;ity, and go &s;traight to what is u&s;eful, how much labour might be &s;aved, and how much farther might we go!</P>
<P>You heard of our arrival at la&s;t, after all the oppo&s;ition of weather and Genoe&s;e &s;ea|man&s;hip: but tho&s;e were only the beginning of our labours:&mdash;the difficulties, noi&s;e, wrang|lings, and time lo&s;t, in getting to <HI>Tetuan,</HI> after landing within a mile of it, and in getting the &s;malle&s;t thing done in this country,
<PB N="3" REF="15">
are not to be equalled even in Spain, nor in any other place you may be acquainted with. <HI>Tetuan</HI> is con&s;idered as the be&s;t town in the&s;e dominions, but to us it appeared a very wretched place. A dreary &s;ilence, poverty, indolence, and dirt, were to us the &s;triking features of their fir&s;t and mo&s;t populous city. Its inhabitants are, however, their be&s;t look|ing people, being probably a mixed race from Spain, Arabs, and natives. Upon the banks of that little river which pa&s;&s;es near the town, there is &s;ome tolerable cultivation, and &s;ome little gardens; but all of them jealou&s;ly concealed, and curiou&s;ly &s;hut up, almo&s;t as much as their hou&s;es in town, where there is not a window nor an open|ing to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Among &s;o many new objects, one hardly knows which to mention; for to mention all is impo&s;&s;ible. The total want of &s;ociety, and almo&s;t of conver&s;ation among them|&s;elves, &s;eems to us equally di&s;mal and &s;ur|pri&s;ing. People bred in &s;uch countries are totally ignorant of the &s;ocial principle which we &s;uppo&s;e natural to man. Though
<PB N="4" REF="16">
yoked by nature to each other, and brought to live together in towns for mutual con|venience, yet are they unacquainted with the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and incapable of en|joying them: their very hou&s;es and gardens look like pri&s;ons to &s;hut them&s;elves up in, and to exclude every eye, and almo&s;t the light of the &s;un, and &s;eem, as it were, to turn away from each other. When by chance two or three people are &s;een &s;itting together, which is &s;eldom, and commonly upon their heels on the dirty ground again&s;t a wall, it is all in &s;ilence: we &s;eldom &s;ee them conver&s;e, I think, except when angry. Such are Ea&s;tern manners, and the effects of oppre&s;&s;ion! Men, while oppre&s;&s;ed, are not communicative; and they mu&s;t pro|bably be at their ea&s;e before they can be &s;ociable and humane.</P>
<P>The French &s;ay, <HI>qu'il faut aimer quelque cho&s;e toujours,</HI> but I think the&s;e people love nothing. A &s;ullen indolence and in|difference &s;eem to exclude every pa&s;&s;ion and principle of activity; and we do not yet &s;ee where the labour can be, in this
<PB N="5" REF="17">
country, &s;ufficient to maintain its inha|bitants. The Moori&s;h character may be &s;omewhat changed and degenerated &s;ince the times they flouri&s;hed in Spain. The iron hand of tyranny has helped to render them &s;till more &s;elfi&s;h and malevolent; and what is wor&s;e for &s;ociety, helple&s;s and in|dolent beings. Such are the &s;ubjects that de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t ever expect to form! Yet we are told they love money to exce&s;s. Human nature is full of incon&s;i&s;tencies. This love of money &s;eems to be a plant that will grow any where, and thrive be&s;t where it &s;eems to have the lea&s;t nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>But to go on with our journey. After wrangling for three days with a &s;tupid and bruti&s;h governor of Tetuan (who is a &s;hoe|maker and a private &s;oldier) concerning hor&s;es and mules, though he had the Em|peror's orders to furni&s;h us; then nearly three days journey, chequered with various di&s;putes and accidents, now of &s;mall import|ance, through a variable country, with &s;ome fine woody hills, we arrived at this place.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="18">We were carried directly to the Prince, &s;aluted with great guns, and attended by a rabble of what they call &s;oldiers. The Prince's impatience to &s;ee us, his eager manner of receiving and &s;urveying us with an apparent plea&s;ure and openne&s;s of countenance, gave &s;ome hopes of a natural curio&s;ity and warmth of heart; but we have already had time to be undeceived; for momentary exertions &s;oon give way to habitual &s;loth or luxury. Such is too often the unhappy fate of high birth, and is here perhaps inevitable.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ents were likewi&s;e produced. My cele&s;tial globe attracted mo&s;t of his attention, and I was in hopes he un|der&s;tood &s;omething of it, having read and heard of their being formerly addicted to a&s;tronomy and mathematics; but was &s;oon undeceived by his que&s;tions and ob&s;erva|tions, though artfully contrived to concea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ignorance; but ignorance can &s;eldom be concealed. He &s;aid, that he had once a ma&s;ter who knew much more than al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="19">We were &s;ent for next day, and con|ducted out of town, where &s;tood &s;even mortars, of three different, but unknown, dimen&s;ions. Throwing &s;hells is of late the great pa&s;&s;ion of this royal family. He &s;aid he had heard of the great &s;kill of us Chri&s;tians, and of mine in particular, in artillery, and de&s;ired we would throw a few &s;hells. A barrel of Dutch powder &s;tood ready opened, and we were de&s;ired to fire at a pole that &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance. We endeavoured to remon&s;trate on the nece&s;&s;ity of knowing <HI>that</HI> di&s;tance, the dimen&s;ions, weights; to have the in&s;truments which we had brought on purpo&s;e, and to &s;hew his Highne&s;s their u&s;e: but all in vain. We were de&s;ired to fire, and to make ha&s;te. My intention was to be politely ob&s;tinate, but I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be per&s;uaded on political con&s;iderations, which I have &s;ince found to be wrong, and that my fir&s;t ideas were the be&s;t. We contrived, however, to walk to the pole, to &s;ee how near his Highne&s;s had thrown a &s;hell. We privately counted our paces, and gue&s;&s;ed the dimen&s;ions of the pieces by the help of our fingers, and the powder
<PB N="8" REF="20">
by &s;ight, feeling, <HI>&amp;c.;</HI> and though the weights, powder, dimen&s;ions, were all &s;o imperfectly known, we chanced to come pretty near the mark, which &s;urpri&s;ed, but did not plea&s;e him; and I have &s;ince found, that nobody mu&s;t pretend to fire &s;o well as the Prince.</P>
<P>We continue to be &s;ent for frequently, and treated variably, ju&s;t as the fits of royal caprice chance to operate. Sometimes with compliments, and at others with neglect, or wor&s;e; &s;ometimes with their greate&s;t honours, <HI>viz.</HI> having &s;ome bad powder fired in our faces by what they call their troops, chiefly hor&s;e; and &s;ometimes by being turned out of court, head and &s;houlders, in the mo&s;t rude and violent manner.</P>
<P>Their troops, if they now de&s;erve that name, might be made tolerable light hor&s;e, under good officers; and the breed of hor&s;es, now rather &s;mall, but of a good race, might ea&s;ily be improved in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="21">Their arms, though not uniform, they &s;ay, are mo&s;tly made in the country, which I do not believe, as there is no appearance of art, materials, or even tools, &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, le&s;t I &s;hould forget; I cannot help mentioning my amazement, that you &s;hould &s;o long continue to employ only Genoe&s;e, and other foreign &s;eamen, for the naviga|tion of your garri&s;on, whom you are breeding up for your enemies, when you could be &s;o ea&s;ily and better &s;erved by your own. Half your pre&s;ent number, if Eng|li&s;h ve&s;&s;els and &s;eamen, would &s;erve you better. Some &s;ay that the Engli&s;h could not live where the&s;e do, but I think it <HI>is not true.</HI> Hundreds round many of your coa&s;ts would be glad of the employ. That the Engli&s;h would be &s;aucier, as &s;ome fancy, I likewi&s;e doubt.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay &s;ome of our friends will envy me the happine&s;s and knowledge to be acquired by this improving journey and emba&s;&s;y, by &s;o intimate an acquaintance
<PB N="10" REF="22">
with this poli&s;hed and enlightened nation, and with &s;uch accompli&s;hed princes. I have enquired, and find &s;ome rea&s;on to be|lieve, that my royal pupil under&s;tands &s;omething of addition, but that multipli|cation and divi&s;ion are beyond his reach or application; and it is thought he can read his own language. But he has &s;trong notions, which he cannot con|ceal, of conquering, &s;ome time or other, all, or at lea&s;t half the Chri&s;tians. You may from thence form &s;ome notion of his education, judgment, and ideas. I do not yet fore&s;ee how I &s;hall come off with this part of my emba&s;&s;y. You may ea&s;ily per|ceive that I &s;hall not be able to teach them much.</P>
<P>What this Emperor means, is not al|ways ea&s;y to gue&s;s; but at pre&s;ent it is not very difficult. The quantity of military &s;tores, of cannon, mortars, howitzers, &s;hells (all mo&s;tly Dutch, and hence not much to be depended on), which he is collecting, is almo&s;t incredible, after &s;eeing his country &s;o poor, ignorant, and mi&s;erable. But
<PB N="11" REF="23">
there is a total want of all the other &s;mall &s;tores nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>an artillery of any &s;ervice;</HI> and indeed of numerous other things, and trades proportioned to the&s;e. I &s;ee no rea&s;on why you &s;hould &s;cruple to help them out, as far as they can be helped, which is not far; and you need be under no fear of improving them too much. They, or at lea&s;t you, ought to know <HI>that it is impo&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER. II.</HI> Differences between European and African Manners. &mdash; Population. &mdash; Arts. &mdash; Indu&s;|try.&mdash;Their Inferiority.</HEAD>
<P>THE va&s;t difference in every thing on pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e &s;traits, is, perhaps, greater than in any equal di&s;tance on our globe, and mu&s;t &s;o &s;trike an European, that he knows not where to begin to give any account of men or things here.</P>
<P>We are a&s;toni&s;hed at the total difference in manners, cu&s;toms, habits, opinions, dre&s;s, food, arts, tools, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the different and oppo&s;ite ways of doing almo&s;t every thing; as if the people on the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;hores meant in every thing to &s;hew their aver&s;ion to each other. But I &s;hall not attempt de|&s;criptions, which are almo&s;t always inade|quate. What I may think practicable to give, you may probably get, if I have time.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="25">Something extraordinary mu&s;t have driven the&s;e poor people into towns, to live in a mo&s;t &s;hockingly filthy manner, for they are horrid &s;tinking places; and it is rather &s;urpri&s;ing that the plague, or &s;ome other di&s;orders, do not vi&s;it them oftener.</P>
<P>If their towns, Morocco, Mequinez, Fez, Tetuan, &s;o far a&s;under, were cut out into villages, and &s;pread over the face of the country, they might be of &s;ome &s;ervice; but now, can only be of u&s;e to the de&s;tructive endeavours of de&s;poti&s;m, and help the Emperor to impoveri&s;h and depopulate the country a little fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>This country, as far as we have gone, is well varied in hill and vale, and tolerably wooded, though not &s;o well watered, and a little too mountainous; it is capable of every kind of cultivation, and of fences, planting, roads, all which it is now almo&s;t without. It &s;eems peopled to about one-fifth of what it might ea&s;ily be made to maintain, and the labour of the pre&s;ent in|habitants is not probably above one-fourth
<PB N="14" REF="26">
of what it might be with more &s;kill and in|du&s;try; &s;o that it is capable of 4x5=20 times its pre&s;ent wealth, &s;trength, and importance, by encouraging agriculture only.</P>
<P>The&s;e people (e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the plains, for the mountaineers are more in|du&s;trious) are at pre&s;ent but little beyond the <HI>&s;hepherd &s;tate</HI> of &s;ociety; their flocks con|&s;titute their chief wealth; attending the&s;e is always a lazy profe&s;&s;ion, and unfavour|able to population. The arts and trades nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a &s;tate are all here, though in a kind of perpetual infancy; not in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ion, as in Europe, but the &s;ame for, I &s;uppo&s;e, the&s;e thou&s;and years pa&s;t. The plough, the mill, the loom, their le&s;&s;er tools and methods of working, are for ever the &s;ame&mdash;&s;imple, trifling, &s;low, and imperfect, in the true Ea&s;tern &s;tile&mdash;no proper divi&s;ion of labour. They have the &s;ame awkward and un&s;kil|ful methods of loading their cattle and car|rying their burdens that were probably u&s;ed by Mahomet him&s;elf, and even by Abra|ham.
<PB N="15" REF="27">
The &s;ame nece&s;&s;aries and ways of life, and kinds of luxury, for ever.</P>
<P>We &s;ee Ea&s;tern manners here, without going to the Ea&s;t. Every idea of change or improvement is excluded by their law, and by ignorance of their wants. Through the avarice of this emperor, indeed, they may acquire new wants and luxuries, and dimini&s;h their national &s;trength and &s;ecu|rity by means of commerce. An open communication with European nations may, in time, bring them acquainted with our wants, our goods, conveniencies, and luxu|ries, as they were while in Spain, when they even went beyond their neighbours in arts and luxury. When a nation comes to have &s;ea-ports, &s;hips, magazines, foreign merchants, peace and commerce admitted, and hence property and fixed habitations, the&s;e habits mu&s;t extend by degrees into the country. The removal is not then &s;o ea&s;y from an approaching enemy. They nece&s;&s;arily become more connected and attached to their property and improved habitations, and dependent on foreign arts
<PB N="16" REF="28">
and nations. Had they continued attached to the original &s;pirit of their con&s;titution, to their poverty and itinerant &s;tate, with all their enmity and abhorrence of Chri&s;tians, they would have remained either independent and invincible, or not worth the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>It is, to us, truly amazing, that all tho&s;e &s;tupid Ea&s;tern governments, founded in de&s;poti&s;m and on principles of unchange|ablene&s;s, of &s;tability in ignorance, &s;hould have &s;ucceeded &s;o generally in fixing man|kind to a &s;tate of barbari&s;m, or &s;o little above it, for ever; in &s;pite of the natural di&s;po&s;itions of men to improve and to better their condition; in &s;pite of that progre&s;s which we &s;uppo&s;e equally natural to the &s;pecies and to the individual, notwith&s;tand|ing the obvious utility of intercour&s;e and indu&s;try to all, by an exchange of produc|tions and knowledge.</P>
<P>You know that the &s;ame code, the Koran and its comments, called the law, includes their religion, laws, manners, cu&s;toms; and that the mode of eating their dinners, or
<PB N="17" REF="29">
wa&s;hing their hands, is as &s;acredly fixed as that of wor&s;hipping their God, and more &s;o than the practice of any virtue, and &s;eem to be con&s;idered by all as more e&s;&s;en|tial. This blending of law and religion together may be the be&s;t way to form a la&s;ting government and people. This reli|gious veneration for certain modes and actions, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s tend to perpetuate them, and keep the people for ever the &s;ame; and their code may have more in|fluence on their minds and manners, than ours upon us.</P>
<P>In modern times, perhaps ever &s;ince the days of ancient Rome, pray have not our education and religious e&s;tabli&s;hments had too great a tendency to in&s;pire us with in|veterate prejudices again&s;t our fellow-crea|tures, for differing with us in certain opi|nions? You know the inveteracy of your neighbours on that &s;ide again&s;t here&s;y and Mahometi&s;m. Here the dete&s;tation and abhorrence of all other &s;ects is &s;trong be|yond conception, and we &s;hould think
<PB N="18" REF="30">
&s;carcely to be humani&s;ed by all the power|ful influence of arts and civilization.</P>
<P>However, we know that one great and liberal mind can often create, and lead many others; and that the&s;e people have had great Princes, who could take liberties with their cu&s;toms, and could contrive to interpret their law with great latitude; and that it is po&s;&s;ible to improve them, al|mo&s;t in &s;pite of them&s;elves. We know that &s;ome of their Princes of Cordova and Granada found means to admit the arts and improvements of every kind, many of which were then, and are now again, &s;up|po&s;ed to be again&s;t their law; and if tho&s;e kingdoms had fortunately continued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Europe, the means, and perhaps the only means, would thereby have re|mained open, of &s;oftening, and gradually reconciling, in &s;ome degree, the inveteracy of tho&s;e two violent and oppo&s;ing per|&s;ua&s;ions of Chri&s;tianity and Mahometi&s;m. There were, at la&s;t, frequent intermarriages even between the Spani&s;h and Mahomedan
<PB N="19" REF="31">
princes. They might, from vicinity, arts, and intercour&s;e, have been led into mutual forbearance and conce&s;&s;ions, which, by de|grees, might have produced a more com|prehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of toleration than the world is now likely &s;oon to enjoy; and this again might, in time, have mitigated and humani&s;ed the more rigorous and inimical opinions and political animo&s;ities of all nations, and have brought them nearer to rea&s;on and each other: means every way preferable to the barbarous inveterate wars, and mutual de&s;truction, which the&s;e two &s;ects at lea&s;t, now &s;eem doomed, with &s;mall intermi&s;&s;ions, long to carry on again&s;t one another.</P>

<P>I AM here &s;even days, &s;ix of them in bed, rather ill, where I now write with diffi|culty, in the cell of a half-ruined convent, the be&s;t lodging to be procured here. One day with the Emperor, which made me wor&s;e. As my cold fit came on, which he perceived, he ordered a fire to be made for me in the open field, where we were at|tending to &s;ome of his experiments. This I did not know at the time; but on &s;eeing a large pile of bru&s;h-wood &s;et on fire, and a&s;king the rea&s;on, I was told it was for me, and that the Emperor had ordered it on &s;eeing me &s;hivering with cold. It &s;eems they could not explain to him the nature of my di&s;order, nor did he know that fevers are often attended with cold fits.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="33">You know I was &s;ent in a hurry, but ill provided for this campaigning &s;ort of life. A camp equipage of &s;ome &s;ort is here the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and principal comfort of a man's life, e&s;pecially when &s;o great a part of it mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed in following this ambling court, who&s;e de&s;ign, if they have any, &s;eems to be to let nobody re&s;t. In|deed, in this country, it is better living in camp, with almo&s;t any &s;ort of conveniences, than in their towns and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een a good deal of this mi&s;erable country, <HI>viz.</HI> the plains, which are in general little cultivated, and &s;till le&s;s inhabited, and only by a few tent villages, very thinly &s;cattered, which are generally moved at different &s;ea&s;ons, according to the pa&s;ture.

chiefly to caution the General again&s;t their applications for my longer &s;tay.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mequinez.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity, by C. B., who now leaves me alone in this di&s;mal court, employed in the agreeable office of dancing attendance from morn to night, and generally without any dinner, on the&s;e Princes of Barbary, or Barbarian Princes; call them which you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I intended to give you &s;ome particulars of our journey hither; but now, when pa&s;t, they appear of le&s;s importance. A journey through a naked, brown, flat country, hardly a tree or a bu&s;h, or any inhabitants, to be &s;een, can afford but little &s;cope for ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Our &s;etting off, the fir&s;t morning, &s;eemed cheerful, with about 500 active hor&s;e, wild
<PB N="24" REF="36">
and irregular, &s;campering and firing powder at each other. By this play, however, the Prince killed one young man, but nobody &s;topped even to a&s;&s;i&s;t or take him up.</P>
<P>We encamped every night, but &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions, and indeed might have &s;tarved but for the goodne&s;s of the Dutch Con&s;ul, who was with the camp. This was the more grievous, becau&s;e at &s;etting out they would not permit us to pro|vide our&s;elves, in&s;i&s;ting on the Prince's doing it for us. However, one night, we were awaked by &s;ome fellows thru&s;ting into our tent &s;ome large wooden di&s;hes, &s;moak|ing full of &s;tewed <HI>cu&s;cus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Granulated pa&s;te, of the &s;ame kind as that of vermicelli.</NOTE>, meat, and onions, as a pre&s;ent from the Prince.</P>
<P>Our awkward and tedious method of pa&s;&s;ing rivers, generally by &s;wimming, de|&s;erves not much particular notice. It ap|pears that one man who can &s;wim well, can conduct a great number of hor&s;es, by tying them together, if the &s;tream is not very rapid. They make little floats to carry
<PB N="25" REF="37">
the baggage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of any thing they can find, of &s;kins blown up, tied together, and cover|ed with bru&s;hwood; but &s;ometimes they can find nothing, for the rivers in tho&s;e plains do not produce gra&s;s, or any tree or verdant plant, even on their banks.</P>
<P>The Prince frequently a&s;ked me, as we rode along, if we had &s;uch fine country for riding. He meant &s;o open and naked. Many great men are, perhaps, too &s;ubject to &s;uch ideas &mdash;from a William the Con|queror, or a King of Per&s;ia, down to a Poli&s;h Lord or feudal Baron; and they con&s;ider their having room to ride or hunt, as of more importance than the producing food for us all, and can even lay wa&s;te po|pulous countries on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ible terror of all who approached the Prince, &s;eems to give him plea&s;ure; but would certainly give pain to a humane mind.</P>
<P>I am wearied here with having nothing to do, having tired out my poor interpreters, and then a Jew, whom I had per&s;uaded to
<PB N="26" REF="38">
walk with me about the country, and about the&s;e half-ruined mud walls and dirty fields, called palaces and gardens. Nobody chu&s;es to walk here, and I may perhaps tire of per&s;i&s;ting in being &s;ingular, and may learn to be as habitually idle as any of them; though I cannot learn to &s;it bare-legged on the ground upon my heels, with my back again&s;t a wall, which &s;eems the only amu&s;ement here of our courtiers, and of the crowds who attend.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER V.</HI> The Dowars.&mdash;Dome&s;tic Employments, and Manners.&mdash;Oppre&s;&s;ion and In&s;ecurity.</HEAD>
<P>THE few black and dirty tent villages (dowars), the only habitations in the&s;e exten&s;ive and naked plains, were at fir&s;t objects of great curio&s;ity, but &s;oon after of di&s;gu&s;t, being &s;hockingly na&s;ty and di&s;|agreeable, e&s;pecially in hot weather. They prefer this roving way of life (governed in &s;mall and dome&s;tic matters by their own &s;hieks) to any fixed habitation, where they would be &s;till more tyranni&s;ed over by a Ba&s;haw, and more &s;ubject to plunder and all &s;orts of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t we &s;aw of the&s;e dowars hap|pened to be cleaner than ordinary, lately pitched on a declivity, though u&s;ually in the plains, for the conveniency of water, and a little cultivation. The inhabitants
<PB N="28" REF="40">
and we were &s;triking objects to each other. Their dre&s;s and appearance, the &s;creaming and noi&s;e of the naked children and dogs that followed and &s;urrounded us; the wild, anxious, and expre&s;&s;ive countenances of &s;ome of the young females, formed all together a curious &s;cene. We were not, on the whole, ill u&s;ed; and we under&s;tand, that Chri&s;tians are not now &s;o rudely treated among them as they u&s;ed to be, by the children throwing &s;tones, accompanied with cur&s;es. They now only &s;ometimes give us abu&s;ive language, repeating certain phra&s;es of the Koran.</P>
<P>I think it not nece&s;&s;ary to tell you much of their occupations in this way of life. They are nearly the &s;ame as y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> find in Scripture in the times of Abraham and Jacob, and that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ome parts of A&s;ia, the dome&s;tic employment of the wo|men being &s;till that of weaving, grinding the corn, cookery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some of their di&s;hes are &s;avoury, often dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;team of the pot, which is generally here of copper, but not often tinned. Here, as in
<PB N="29" REF="41">
Spain, the primitive method of treading out the corn by cattle is &s;till practi&s;ed, in&s;tead of thre&s;hing. In Europe, the flail has been long in u&s;e. Perhaps you may now im|prove upon <HI>that,</HI> as well as the other ma|chines of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>In their towns, where the nece&s;&s;ary arts and trades are practi&s;ed, their tools, and methods of working, might be de&s;cribed; but I do not &s;ee the utility of tho&s;e matters to us; their ways of weaving, boring, plaining, cutting, baking, tanning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being all different from ours, but much in|ferior. Their leather is not now &s;o good as formerly, and I believe you already pre|pare better of the &s;ame kind in England.</P>
<P>You know they u&s;e no knives, forks, &s;poons, chairs, nor tables; tho&s;e being for|bid by their religion. Mahomet, like Ly|curgus and mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern lawgivers, meant to exclude luxury at the expence of every art and comfort of life, and thus ren|der mankind for ever &s;tationary. This we &s;hould think impo&s;&s;ible, and not in the
<PB N="30" REF="42">
nature of man, were it not for the example of China. But we know that even their religion is not &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, where the &s;oil is good, and the government tolerable: de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t join, and her at|tendant poverty, effectually to prevent the improvements and the progre&s;s of the arts and luxury natural to man.</P>
<P>The camels are very u&s;eful here, and proper for the long journies through the dry African de&s;arts. How provident is the Great Author of Nature! They can live a week without water. In &s;ome parts the inhabitants live entirely on their milk, with a few dates, and wear only their &s;kins.</P>
<P>We can ea&s;ily conceive this country to have been once rich and fruitful, as we learn from its imperfect hi&s;tory, and from that of the Romans. It might ea&s;ily be made to produce food and raiment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in great abundance, by means of a ju&s;t govern|ment. But in&s;ecurity and oppre&s;&s;ion have &s;o long prevailed, as to bani&s;h all &s;ettled plans of providing; and in the&s;e fine corn
<PB N="31" REF="43">
countries, they have often &s;uffered frequent &s;carcity. I believe it is only &s;ince &s;ome grain has been permitted to be exported, and by the Emperor's laying up &s;ome &s;tore of it him&s;elf, that tho&s;e frequent famines have been prevented.</P>
<P>But there &s;eems to be very little work go|ing on, even in their towns. Sitting, &s;moke|ing, and prayers, employ a great deal of their time. Few things &s;eem to rou&s;e them to any voluntary exertions, except their hatred to Chri&s;tians, which does not yet appear to be &s;o much abated as you &s;up|po&s;e, only in &s;ome of their &s;ea-ports. They &s;till teach many of their children, in towns, to read and write, and exerci&s;e their memo|ries by parts of the Koran. Their methods &s;eem to be &s;imple and direct, and they might ea&s;ily be carried farther. We know that &s;ome of them were once &s;tudious and learned. I think one &s;ees in &s;ome of their youth, &s;till a certain open warmth and frank hone&s;ty of heart; but I believe <HI>that</HI> gradually declines with years into a &s;ullen indifference about well-doing, and produces
<PB N="32" REF="44">
many other vices. De&s;poti&s;m &s;oon gets the better of nature.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a government, there can be nothing fixed or certain; and of all its uncertainties, that of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;tructive. It is here neither hereditary nor elective as yet, being generally &s;eized by u&s;urpation through blood&s;hed. A civil war commonly attends every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t. We, who have the happine&s;s to live in long and well-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ocieties, cannot be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the great time and number of circum|&s;tances required to e&s;tabli&s;h rules of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, or indeed any rule or fixed regulation.</P>
<P>The&s;e cherifs, or de&s;cendants of Mahomet, have a prodigious advantage in that very cir|cum&s;tance, if they knew how to make a pro|per u&s;e of it. There are a number of them &s;till di&s;per&s;ed in this, and probably in other Mahomedan countries. The pre&s;ent reign|ing family here is of that race. If it were po&s;&s;ible to make them travel, and give them any proper education, they might intro|duce
<PB N="33" REF="45">
any improvement, or e&s;tabli&s;h any con&s;titution of government they plea&s;ed. But, on the contrary, the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Muley I&s;hmael have already nearly de|&s;troyed all the good he did, or had begun to do, which was con&s;iderable, amid&s;t his mi&s;|chievous cruelties. He had ideas of colonies even more than of conque&s;ts, and brought great numbers from the &s;outh to people his country and recruit his armies. But the&s;e have already mo&s;tly di&s;appeared, the country is again de&s;olate, and the army neglected.</P>
<P>But it can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary, now-a-days, to point out the numberle&s;s evils and fatal con&s;equences of de&s;poti&s;m. If &s;ome European nations go on declining in that direction, it can hardly be from want of information of its pernicious effects, but with their eyes open; not from ignorance, but weakne&s;s, or from want of order or con&s;titution. But, alas! I fear mankind are not to be <HI>written</HI> into virtue or re&s;olution. Perhaps little more can now be done in that
<PB N="34" REF="46">
way, than to put them frequently in mind of their danger. They might be more &s;en&s;ible of it, if they were to come and &s;ee their brethren here. And I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve it is not now &s;o much the fa&s;hion as formerly, for our travellers to advance beyond the limits of Europe.</P>
<P>From reading &s;ome parts of their hi&s;tory, I believe we rank the&s;e people too high in the &s;cale of &s;ociety. We fancy &s;ome ve&s;tiges of their former greatne&s;s and learning mu&s;t &s;till appear, forgetting the nece&s;&s;ary velocity of fall in a declining empire, and how &s;oon it leaves our ideas behind. But degeneracy will, perhaps, always differ from the &s;avage &s;tate, and will be weaker, and more abject; and when once &s;unk and reduced, there &s;eems no po&s;&s;ibility of getting them up again, but by conquering and coloni&s;ing their country. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how little even the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t improved nations learn from each other, and how long they are in learning that little; and the ruder nations &s;till le&s;s. The higher &s;tates of im|provement
<PB N="35" REF="47">
cannot, indeed, impart much of their knowledge to the lower. Our luxuries and improvements &s;uit them not. In order to arrive at the&s;e, they mu&s;t pa&s;s through certain &s;teps of a progre&s;s, and mu&s;t learn to want, and be gradually rou&s;ed to exer|tions and indu&s;try.</P>

Hitherto, I find the Jew &s;ecretary the man of mo&s;t knowledge and be&s;t conver&s;ation of any about his court.

<P>The effects of your letters being all again&s;t us, I have &s;ince tried all methods to get one of my own pre&s;ented and ex|plained to his M&mdash;; and at length per|&s;uaded Sombel (with &s;ome promi&s;es) to &s;tand in the way, with it in his hand, as the Emperor rode pa&s;t, in hopes of his a&s;king concerning it, which &s;ometimes &s;uc|ceeds, by watching his humour.

Fearful and jealous even of his own creatures and &s;ons; timidly cautious of delegating the &s;malle&s;t degree of power, he has adopted the weak and impracticable &s;y&s;tem of doing every act of authority him&s;elf, dictating in the mi|nutiae of every man's office throughout the kingdom; and endeavouring to render every one, to whom he is forced to tru&s;t

&s;ome authority, as contemptible as po&s;&s;ible, by which he often defeats his own views. They become his enemies:&mdash;he can have no friends.

Tho&s;e he &s;eems to wi&s;h to be con&s;idered only as a kind of me&s;&s;engers, whom he &s;ends to fleece the people, and bring all to him.</P>
<P>If any man, by chance or artifice, e&s;cape the&s;e fleecers, and is &s;u&s;pected of having money, he is &s;ent for by the Emperor, impri&s;oned, and tortured, till he di&s;covers it; which he does only by degrees, a little at a time. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how much &s;ome of them will bear before they di&s;cover. Some have been known to die under the tortures, rather than di&s;clo&s;e their hidden trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>A blind and rapacious avarice &s;eems here the univer&s;al and only ruling pa&s;&s;ion. How|ever &s;trange, this pa&s;&s;ion for money appears to prevail mo&s;t where there is the lea&s;t &s;ecurity, and the fewe&s;t plea&s;ures to be pur|cha&s;ed.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Of the Emperor.&mdash;The Inhabitants of the Plains and the Mountains, and ancient Arabian Race.&mdash;Importance of National Intercour&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>IN the few conver&s;ations we have had, I have &s;ometimes attempted to turn the attention of his M&mdash; to objects of utility: but in vain. Greatne&s;s &s;poils men for con|ver&s;ation, as well as for many other things. Accu&s;tomed to take the lead in every thing, they cannot follow when it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary. They gradually become &s;o &s;ore and fa&s;tidious, that they can hardly admit any &s;ubject into di&s;cour&s;e, but what they intro|duce them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, his habitual and unnece&s;&s;ary cunning, jealou&s;y, and vanity; his ignorant and timid interpreters, render it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to explain any thing, or to talk common &s;en&s;e to him for any time. He &s;eldom conver&s;es with much attention on any &s;ubject, except where money is &s;ome way concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="65"><HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>avarice,</HI> which are nearly con|nected, are his ruling pa&s;&s;ions, and may generally &s;erve as a key to his actions and de&s;igns. By the&s;e, you may both under|&s;tand and govern him.</P>
<P>But with all this, he is a ju&s;t, good, and humane character, for this country. With all the habits of tyranny, and of a bad education, he, neverthele&s;s, does not, like many of his predece&s;&s;ors, wantonly trangre&s;s the natural rules of ju&s;tice, only where his pecuniary intere&s;t is concerned, which is, to be &s;ure, much too often for the good of his country, or of his people. He knows the country well, and mo&s;t individuals who are at all above the common &s;lave. He would make a good <HI>lieutenant de police</HI>&mdash; and admit of no robbers but him&s;elf. And, indeed, were it not for his own con&s;tant attention, his rapacity and inju&s;tice would be imitated throughout his dominions.</P>
<P>I do not find that he, like his predece&s;|&s;ors, practi&s;es the horrid cu&s;tom of <HI>&s;elling</HI> the power to torture and plunder any one &s;u&s;pected of being rich. He now re&s;erves
<PB N="54" REF="66">
that power for him&s;elf, and &s;eldom neglects long to u&s;e it, though &s;ometimes with un|u&s;ual lenity, he accepts a <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> as a purcha&s;e of his forbearance. And the ge|nerality of tho&s;e robberies he executes on &s;ome pretext of right or ju&s;tice. Happily even tyrants mu&s;t often &s;acrifice, at lea&s;t appearances, at the &s;hrine of ju&s;tice. You mu&s;t excu&s;e ha&s;te, and hence my returning often to the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>One &s;ees the character of a people only by glimp&s;es now and then, and which you mu&s;t take as occa&s;ions chance to &s;hine. The&s;e people, as troops, with all their indolence, have great fire at times, a momentary kind of courage, rage, or enthu&s;ia&s;m:&mdash;<HI>et alors</HI> (a Frenchman told me) <HI>ils &s;e font tuer d' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ez bonne grace.</HI> They are temperate, and even ab&s;temious; often penetrating and &s;agacious; but then they carry it too far, to cunning, duplicity, deceit. They have great pride and <HI>hauteur;</HI> but not that which re&s;trains them from meanne&s;s and fraud.</P>
<P>The Moors of the plains, and the Bre|bers, and other cla&s;&s;es of the mountains,
<PB N="55" REF="67">
are obviou&s;ly different races of people. The many revolutions which the&s;e northern parts of Africa have undergone, may have repeatedly de&s;troyed all the traces and cha|racter of the original inhabitants; but the&s;e would perhaps again appear, if left to them|&s;elves: in &s;hort, the general indigenous in|habitant of all this continent was probably the negro; and the nature of the country may be &s;uch, if left to it&s;elf, as to turn the pre&s;ent different races all to negroes again in the cour&s;e of time. But as the moun|tains here, as el&s;ewhere, have not been &s;o much over-run by enemies as the plains, it is among tho&s;e fir&s;t we mu&s;t look for the olde&s;t inhabitants. They are obviou&s;ly a different race from tho&s;e of the plains:&mdash; they are generally thin, light, active, and rather fair; and tho&s;e of the towns and plains, fatter, heavier, and more of a copper coloured and mixed breed.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect there are but few of the ancient Arabian race now remaining in Africa, or they are much degenerated. I have heard there are &s;till &s;ome few di&s;tinct tribes or
<PB N="56" REF="68">
families of them in &s;ome of the internal parts behind the Algerine dominions; a more moral and elegant, a proud, but &s;till a pa&s;toral people. Here, poverty and oppre&s;|&s;ion have long &s;ince cancelled almo&s;t every di&s;tinction of character, as well as of rank. The dread and anxiety of perpetual danger hanging over their heads, may be &s;aid to &s;u&s;pend all character, and &s;tifle what they would have been under other circum&s;tances. They are &s;agacious, yet ignorant; rapacious, yet indolent; &s;ometimes active, though not &s;trong, with a rooted and habitual enmity towards all other nations, in proportion, as u&s;ual, to their own ignorance and &s;uper&s;ti|tion; but the Jews and Chri&s;tians have long been the mo&s;t immediate objects of their hatred and contempt.</P>
<P>Vices happily counteract each other in this world. Avarice begins to make them more tolerant here, at lea&s;t in their &s;ea-port towns. The frequent pre&s;ents and the commerce of the Chri&s;tians have in &s;ome mea&s;ure fixed their regard and attention; and their hopes of making &s;omething of us, procures us &s;ome temporary civilities.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69">On mutual control and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, on action and counteraction, depends the whole &s;y&s;tem of nature, phy&s;ical and moral.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER X.</HI> Of the Prince, and Emperor.&mdash;Peculiarities.</HEAD>
<P>WE have explained your letters to the Prince. That part which condemns the con&s;ul, gave him great plea&s;ure, and good humour. He laughed heartily as he &s;at employed in taking to pieces, and &s;poil|ing a very good London-made clock, a new Spani&s;h pre&s;ent, which was probably brought there that I might &s;ee and judge of their friend&s;hip with Spain. I took the opportunity of a&s;king for the &s;eamen, and he readily promi&s;ed me his intere&s;t; then mounted and rode to his father, within a few doors, and the clock may have e&s;caped for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We have, to-day, had &s;ome dinner at the palace, an extraordinary thing in the&s;e times, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome almonds and rai&s;ins, and, with difficulty, &s;ome water.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="76">Our hopes con&s;i&s;t in the letters having the &s;ame effect on the father as on the &s;on, which I doubt. With him, hardly any one here has per&s;onally any other than that &s;hort-lived influence which his pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ions or nece&s;&s;ities &s;ometimes give to tho&s;e who happen to be near him at the time. I believe he is too fearful and cauti|ous to have a friend, or any one with whom he may regularly con&s;ult. Though at once both artful and a&s;&s;uming, and taking the credit of every mea&s;ure as his own, though borrowed, he carefully avoids the appearance of being at a lo&s;s, or in any doubt. Yet he is not unfrequently &s;een to be greatly perplexed; and is then very &s;oli|citous for the opinions of tho&s;e who chance to be near him, though the&s;e are generally dictated by fear, ignorance, or &s;elf-intere&s;t. Much of his conduct, and of his public mea&s;ures, favour of &s;uch a &s;ource. This &s;on is, however, to-day in favour; which was not the ca&s;e la&s;t week.</P>
<P>Their actions and opinions are full of uncertainty, paradox, change, contradiction,
<PB N="65" REF="77">
and caprice. But the wild, flighty, variable humour, and true Barbarian character, is much &s;tronger and more con&s;picuous in the &s;ons than in the father; for he affects wi&s;|dom, and &s;ets up for the great head-piece of his family and race: and by means of a little caution, di&s;cretion, cunning, and often indeed good &s;en&s;e, he pa&s;&s;es here for a So|lomon, for profound and deeply learned, but not for brave. The Barbarian idea of courage is in&s;eparable from that of cruelty; and he is humane to a degree almo&s;t un|known in his family or in this government; and though his humanity is not quite what we &s;hould dignify by that name, nor &s;o powerful as to with&s;tand his avarice when they come in competition, yet it often ap|pears in public, and is the means of &s;aving many lives. He wi&s;hes to treat &s;maller crimes with le&s;s &s;everity than has been cu&s;tomary here, and for this he is unpopu|lar, and held in &s;ome degree of &s;ecret con|tempt by his more &s;avage &s;ons, and by the remains of the army, who &s;ay, <Q>There &s;hould be a &s;tream of blood always flow|ing from the throne, in order to govern
<PB N="66" REF="78">
this country properly.</Q> And as one of the in&s;tances of his weakne&s;s, this monarch has been known to be cruel, again&s;t his nature, in order to &s;upport this character of bravery, and to gain the opinion of &s;uch people as the&s;e. You know that, <HI>par de|voir,</HI> he is the only executioner in his kingdom; and dexterity in cutting off heads, is among the fir&s;t of royal accom|pli&s;hments here, and is frequently the &s;ub|ject of common conver&s;ation among the people. And with &s;uch a people as the&s;e now are, it is perhaps the be&s;t method of pre&s;erving that nece&s;&s;ary terror and re&s;pect to him&s;elf and the laws.</P>
<P>All his re&s;olutions, however extravagant, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the immediate in&s;pi|rations of God. He judges and admini&s;ters ju&s;tice in a very ha&s;ty and &s;ummary way, at his levee. His &s;entences, being &s;udden in&s;pirations, often before the cau&s;e is half heard&mdash;hands, heads, are cut off; the whole proce&s;s and execution, often the work only of a few minutes.

<PB N="67" REF="79">
than formerly, as in Muley I&s;hmael's time, though it is matter of regret to many of his &s;oldiers and &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It is probably from the Ea&s;t, that we too had once got the ab&s;urd and terrific idea of kings being God's vicegerents here on earth; an idea which our European princes do not &s;eem, in the&s;e days, &s;o fond of pro|pagating; as, fortunately for &s;ociety, it has become more nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to be be|loved, than to be feared, by their &s;ubjects.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XI.</HI> More Anecdotes of the Emperor.&mdash;Bad Ac|commodations, and State of the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Emperor is rather in his element at the&s;e levees, or audiences. Cunning and &s;en&s;ible, he is no bad courtier, though a coar&s;e one, and &s;ays &s;ome artful and well-&s;tudied things, which often have the effects he intends by them; and though we are not all deceived, all are obliged to prai&s;e his wi&s;dom, and pretend to admire and believe&mdash;as is not unu&s;ual, I believe, at other courts.</P>
<P>He has there lately declared, that he means to make war on the Dutch, if their emba&s;&s;y (that is, their pre&s;ents) does not &s;oon appear; and it is &s;aid, that nothing under ten thou|&s;and ducats will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, or prevent the war. In &s;hort, though not paid
<PB N="69" REF="81">
annually, it is a tribute; and we are all tributary to him.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, he will grant no corn to the Chri&s;tians this year till late in May. The Chri&s;tians are quite out of favour of late. He hardly now &s;ees any of tho&s;e with whom he u&s;ed to be quite intimate.</P>
<P>The cry of war with any Chri&s;tian power is always popular here; and he deals out, at his levees, a little hopes of it now and then, for popularity, and other various pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>You &s;ee the promi&s;es of the tenth are for|gotten again, as u&s;ual, here. One of the Tetuan Chri&s;tians is taken from me, be|cau&s;e Sombel has had a hint of &s;ome hopes of a ran&s;om, which he mu&s;t &s;hare with his ma&s;ter. The next that &s;eems to require being a&s;ked for, is our Vice Con&s;ul of Mo|godore.</P>
<P>I write mo&s;t of this on my knee, <HI>a la Mori&s;co.</HI> We pitch our tent in our room,
<PB N="70" REF="82">
and the tent being none of the be&s;t, you know, keeps out only part of the rain which comes through the roof of the hou&s;e. I cannot manage here to keep my feet dry for a whole day, nor to get rid of a &s;econd cold, though not &s;o feveri&s;h as the fir&s;t. We have changed from the convent, but for the wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible. It is hard to &s;ay which are the mo&s;t uncomfortable kind of animals for landlords and companions, Spani&s;h friars, Moors, or Jews.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be tolerably good Moors in time, as to indolence and &s;obriety; and &s;hall have again to learn to drink wine, though not bad water. Slavery it&s;elf would probably require only a certain time to re|concile and deba&s;e the mind.</P>
<P>The pride of poli&s;hed times is, perhaps, too apt to con&s;ider the affairs of barbarous nations as unworthy of notice, and barren of in&s;truction. But I think a mind that is warm in the pur&s;uits and inve&s;tigation of human nature, will find her intere&s;ting in every &s;hape. Though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am
<PB N="71" REF="83">
too often out of humour with the&s;e people, when teazed and fatigued with many di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tances. I believe few are ever inclined to repeat their vi&s;itation, but &s;uch as are obliged to it. Yet when the troubles are over, and dimini&s;hed by di&s;|tance and time, and only the agreeable recol|lections remain, as u&s;ual with mo&s;t journies, I may then perhaps experience a change of &s;entiment, and may have no material ob|jections to repeat this journey hither in the manner you mention.</P>
<P>Man is probably worth con&s;idering in every &s;tate and condition of &s;ociety; and among people, though &s;o far behind us, &s;ome arts and works may be ob&s;erved that at lea&s;t <HI>&s;eem</HI> worthy our attention, as objects of curio&s;ity, if not of utility. But u&s;e|ful hints may be picked up in almo&s;t any country, e&s;pecially by military men, who &s;hould know the &s;imple and ready ways of doing every thing.</P>
<P>The ingenuity, as well as the &s;tupidity of the&s;e people, while both differ &s;o widely
<PB N="72" REF="84">
from our own, become objects of curio&s;ity to us. They will frequently perform great things with very &s;mall means; and, with the mo&s;t trifling and &s;imple tools, will exe|cute works where we &s;hould require a com|plicated apparatus. They can erect great and exten&s;ive buildings without &s;tone, brick, or mortar, and with &s;carcely any timber, <HI>viz.</HI> of dirt and mud, by means of wooden ca&s;es or frames, removable when the fabric is dry. But you &s;ee there &s;ome of the taby walls, for which they were formerly &s;o fa|mous; and they had then very &s;trong mix|tures for mortar and pla&s;ter&mdash;arts which are now almo&s;t lo&s;t here.</P>
<P>But they will make a water-mill out of timber that we &s;hould think in&s;ufficient for a &s;tool. They will form a &s;ort of bridge over a river with &s;part or ba&s;s ropes &s;tretch|ed acro&s;s it, without any purcha&s;e but the main force of a number of hands; and though it drags in the water, it will carry &s;ome people and baggage, while the re&s;t &s;wim the hor&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="85">And they make floats that carry over baggage, in a country where there is nei|ther &s;tick, &s;tone, nor bu&s;h, with no other material but the &s;kins of animals blown up with the mouth. The women weave tole|rable coar&s;e cloth without any loom, merely with pieces of reed.</P>
<P>But, as you may readily &s;uppo&s;e, tho&s;e works are all &s;lowly and badly executed. They are now ignorant of all the fir&s;t prin|ciples of philo&s;ophy and mathematics, and incapable of retaining &s;uch knowledge in the country, even if it were introduced. The few middling or bad methods they po&s;&s;e&s;s, are derived to them from undi&s;coverable antiquity, and are fixed by law and cu&s;tom, beyond the power of improvement. Cu&s;tom, which they re&s;pect as law, would of it&s;elf be &s;ufficient to keep them as they are, without the help of de&s;poti&s;m and the de|population it produces.</P>
<P>Their towns are generally built of this dirt and taby, upon the very quarries of free-&s;tone. Five hundred hor&s;e require a
<PB N="74" REF="86">
whole day to pa&s;s a &s;mall river. It is &s;in|gular, though not very delicate, to &s;ee the women working the pa&s;te for the <HI>cu&s;cus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Al cu&s;cus,</HI> is a granulated pa&s;te, the &s;ame as that of vermicelli.</NOTE>, on the ground between their legs.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade them that our improvements can be of any u&s;e to them; and, prejudices apart, they are not perhaps always wrong in tho&s;e opinions. The arts, the police of populous and poli&s;h|ed nations, are not fit for hords of &s;hep|herds. They do not want to be taught to do things in le&s;s time or &s;pace, with fewer hands, or le&s;s force, while they have <HI>time, &s;pace,</HI> and <HI>hands</HI> enough. Neither men nor women will have occa&s;ion for our fine things, while the former are tyrants and the latter &s;laves.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of your own learned men di&s;pute, and &s;ome deny, the advantages of &s;cience and civilization. The mo&s;t ab&s;urd opi|nions will find partizans. Doubtle&s;s, the two extremes of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>refine|ment</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="87">
have each their vices and their vir|tues, their <HI>forts</HI> and <HI>foibles.</HI> What we gain in one way, we mu&s;t often lo&s;e in others; &s;uch is the fate&mdash;the law of our nature. The progre&s;s of certain vicious weakne&s;&s;es may keep pace with that of knowledge; and the &s;ame cau&s;es, wealth and lei&s;ure, may contribute, at once, to the increa&s;e of vice, luxury, and &s;cience. The middle ranks of men may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, improve, while the two extremes of high and low, may both incline towards corrup|tion and depravity. Yet, on the whole, we mu&s;t believe, that man may live happier in a civilized and well-regulated com|munity, than in a &s;tate of anarchy and ra|pine; and that the benefits of arts and im|provements mu&s;t be at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to reward that continual and laborious pur&s;uit which we &s;ee always attending their pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the deci&s;ion of &s;uch que&s;tions, I be|lieve it will be &s;afer to attend to the opi|nions of tho&s;e who have acted certain dif|ferent parts and duties among men, than to

<P>IN an inqui&s;itive and improving age, we mu&s;t expect every po&s;&s;ible variety of opinion to be advanced and &s;upported.

And as to that fir&s;t and mo&s;t important character <HI>before mentioned,</HI> a <HI>great lawgiver,</HI> perhaps we cannot expect to &s;ee one again, while there is &s;o little chance of the different excellencies of the human character being joined in one; &mdash;not till the great philo&s;opher, the &s;oldier, traveller, &s;tate&s;man, &s;cholar, hi&s;torian, poet, mu&s;ician, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> can again be found together and joined to the be&s;t heart. This was al|ways a rare being among men; but now, with the minute &s;eparation of arts and pro|fe&s;&s;ions&mdash;with our partial, tedious, inactive, unanimated, unfeeling kind of education, the production of &s;uch men is become quite improbable.

<P>When we &s;ee the different kinds of vices prevailing in &s;uch varied degrees in the dif|ferent countries we vi&s;it, and the gradual change of national characters, can we doubt the influence of education, of government, of manners? Or can we believe human na|ture or mankind to be always the &s;ame in all ages and nations? as &s;ome of our over|learned and wi&s;e would have us believe, as a very great and &s;age di&s;covery.</P>

Nothing can be done but by the Prince; and you &s;ee how improbable it is that any thing like a lawgiver,&mdash;a Peter the Great,&mdash;can ever be produced here&mdash;<HI>on auroit beau precher.</HI> What could move a Prince who feels nothing for his people, his fame, or his po&s;terity, and who dreads the riches and population of his own coun|try? How &s;et about to reform a bar|barous exclu&s;ive religion, and mitigate their

abhorrence of Chri&s;tians, which has been implanted as nece&s;&s;ary to their exi&s;tence, and to their conque&s;ts; and now, perhaps, too deeply rooted in their habits and cu&s;toms, ever to be moved? The ta&s;k of reforming or re&s;toring &s;uch a people, &s;eems too great for any man. It would not be forming a new nation, but mending an old one, which is here probably by far the mo&s;t difficult of the two. He would have to undo, or reform him&s;elf, his court, the people, the government, and then to make up the whole anew from wor&s;e than nothing. Again&s;t the mo&s;t inveterate prejudices, vices, idlene&s;s, ignorance,&mdash;the labour &s;eems be|yond the power of man.</P>
<P>Nothing above the rank of a workman can yet live, or be of any u&s;e here; and Hodge the ma&s;on may be of far greater &s;ervice than a Duke de Riperda, or a Mar|quis de Viale.</P>
<P>Some acquaintance with the rude nations &s;hould be kept up among the civilized, though it will be more difficult to acquire
<PB N="84" REF="96">
than that of their poli&s;hed neighbours, which may be tolerably procured without moving from home, by the help of books, &s;ociety, commerce, travellers, re&s;emblance; &mdash;all of which fail us here. Information we find &s;o rare and difficult to procure, even of the next town. As to the Euro|peans &s;ettled in &s;uch countries, it is melan|choly to &s;ee how &s;oon their notions are confined and a&s;&s;imilated to the place, and how few ideas they have beyond their own bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But ere I forget the news of the day.&mdash; This Emperor liberally gave to the Spani&s;h Con&s;ul, the la&s;t audience, without ran&s;om, eleven Spaniards his pri&s;oners, whom he had bought of the Ri&s;iens. It is only with <HI>Carlos,</HI> as he calls the King of Spain, that he is now on a truly attached and friendly footing. There is a change for you! What mu&s;t this footing have co&s;t Carlos? You &s;hould &s;pare nothing to know the particulars; for from &s;ome of the&s;e much may always be drawn of future plans and intentions: the general plan or meaning is ea&s;ily &s;een. At the

&s;ame time he &s;aid he had given orders to his &s;outhern Ba&s;haw to tell the Moun|taineers to kill all the Engli&s;h who may be ca&s;t in, or come there, for the future. Fortunately they will not obey him, nor his Ba&s;haw, e&s;pecially while they have hopes of getting any thing for them at Santa Cruz, or Mogadore.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIV.</HI> Georgraphical and phy&s;ical Ideas.&mdash;Cultiva|tion. &mdash; Life. &mdash; Di&s;ea&s;es. &mdash; De&s;truction. &mdash; Conjectures in Natural Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now &s;een more of this country, toward the mountains behind it. A poor population, thin crops, and a want of &s;kill, exertion, and indu&s;try, are too con|&s;picuous throughout the whole. In &s;ome parts toward the &s;kirts of the mountains (which is in mo&s;t countries the be&s;t &s;oil), and in &s;ome tracts of their plains, the land in tillage is rather exten&s;ive, in proportion to the few mi&s;erable inhabitants &s;o thinly &s;cattered over it. But they have little or no other labour; no fences, manures, fodder, gardens, hou&s;es, trees, nor roads, to mind, &s;o that they will plow, or rather &s;cratch, up a good deal of land with their trifling little plough, which is often without iron.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="99">The plains run to &s;and in many places, and the be&s;t parts are generally but of a light and thin &s;oil, which may be in a great mea&s;ure owing to the want of cultivation and vege|tation, and likewi&s;e to the want of water; a want that is but too general, I believe, throughout this great continent of Africa; and hence it mu&s;t ever be but thinly peopled. From our knowledge of its coa&s;ts, and the few rivers, it is plain there mu&s;t be much of its internal extent entirely without rivers, and therefore not habitable in tho&s;e climates.</P>
<P>To form a general geographic idea of this kingdom, conceive a long &s;lip of low coun|try along this coa&s;t, from the Straits down to about 28 N. lat. where Atlas &s;houlders on the ocean. A branch of tho&s;e moun|tains running northward behind this plain to Cape Spartel, helps to bound and cut it off from the re&s;t of the continent. The few <HI>rivers</HI> (as you &s;ee in the map) that traver&s;e this &s;lip of country, do not improve it much, except in &s;ome places where they overflow. Not &s;upplied by le&s;&s;er &s;treams, as el&s;ewhere, in their cour&s;e from the moun|tains
<PB N="88" REF="100">
to the &s;ea, this light land drinks up all the rain; they &s;eldom produce any verdure even on their banks. Not a plant or &s;hrub, nothing verdant to be &s;een, not &s;o much as to mark the margin or cour&s;e of the river; &s;o that we may almo&s;t tumble into it, before we di&s;cover where it is.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very di&s;mal in the&s;e exten&s;ive brown flats, with almo&s;t as good a horizon as at &s;ea, and without any green object within the di&s;tant view. The land &s;eems to produce &s;carcely any thing but what is &s;own; and where any thing grows &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, it is &s;mall of its kind. Though a fine climate, &s;everal of the Spani&s;h fore&s;t trees are here only like &s;hrubs. Both ve|getable and animal life are in a weakly and unimproved &s;tate. One &s;ees very little &s;ign of animal &s;trength or vigour, except in the hor&s;e, and that is but &s;eldom, for this Emperor has &s;adly neglected and di&s;couraged the breed of them. The camel, though large, is but a weakly, &s;heepi&s;h, and &s;luggi&s;h animal, and carries but a &s;mall load in proportion to his &s;ize. The fierce
<PB N="89" REF="101">
lions and tygers are in the mountains, which, I &s;u&s;pect, are here at lea&s;t the fitte&s;t habitations for man too.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t common here are agues, drop&s;ies, itch, and other cutaneous di&s;orders, often to a violent or leprous de|gree. Pray are not the&s;e the effects of poor blood, and of poor and na&s;ty living?</P>
<P>But &s;ome of their land produces good grain, though their mode of hu&s;bandry gives but poor thin crops. Their being able lately to export &s;ome of it, is not &s;o much a proof of their indu&s;try, as of a want of population to eat it. However, this ex|portation might be of &s;ervice to the country, if the Emperor could let it alone, or ma|nage it with common &s;en&s;e; both of which are quite improbable.</P>
<P>Towards the &s;kirts of the mountains, which there form green hills, though many of them too &s;andy like the plains, we find more flocks, and &s;ome good land, and, I think, a better &s;ort of people, and &s;everal
<PB N="90" REF="102">
kinds of good cattle, which it might be worth while to export, and to try by cro&s;s breeds in other countries. May not this peace and communication with Spain in time produce &s;ome good effects to both the&s;e countries at lea&s;t? They want much to improve their breed of cattle in Spain.</P>
<P>There are different races of Mountaineers between this kingdom and Algiers, who acknowledge neither &s;tate, and I believe are almo&s;t independent. Some of them are called <HI>Brebers,</HI> and hence is &s;uppo&s;ed to come the name of Berberia. Tho&s;e &s;eem to be the olde&s;t inhabitants, mo&s;t like to the Mauritanians of the Romans, and it is &s;aid &s;ome of them &s;till call all Europeans or &s;trangers by a name that &s;ounds like <HI>Romi.</HI> This Emperor goes often again&s;t &s;ome of them, perhaps partly by way of exerci&s;ing his troops; which would be a very good plan, if he had &s;kill, exertion, and &s;teadine&s;s equal to it. But he makes no conque&s;ts, and only rai&s;es by force &s;ome accidental contributions. In tho&s;e expeditions he has likewi&s;e a view
<PB N="91" REF="103">
to <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> both in the countries through which he marches, and tho&s;e he goes again&s;t. To impoveri&s;h, to depre&s;s the efforts, and de&s;troy the effects of indu&s;try, is one of the grand &s;ecret objects of this &s;pecies of government. His rabble of an army, and its followers, by the circuit they u&s;ually take on the&s;e occa&s;ions, mo&s;t effec|tually perform the different offices of de|&s;truction, and may be &s;aid to eat up the country. The&s;e Mountaineers were pro|bably the kind of inhabitants found here at the time of the Arabian or Mahomedan conque&s;ts. They &s;eem more indu&s;trious, though a &s;maller race of people than tho&s;e of the tent villages in the plains. They have fixed habitations, huts, and &s;ome little gardens.</P>
<P>This now &s;treight low coa&s;t may former|ly have been in a more concave, or in|dented and uneven line, and may have been filled up thus to a right line, by time and the &s;ea: now without bays, head|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands, or harbours, all the rivers forming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars at their entrances.

<P>Mogadore might likewi&s;e, perhaps, be improved, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the i&s;lands with piers and jettees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if it could be deepened by the help of the little river, or other means.</P>
<P>There are few hard bodies to be found; no marble, or ores, till we go back to the mountains. Mo&s;t of the &s;tone on the coa&s;t &s;eems like newly hardened, or ju&s;t cohe&s;ing &s;and, like that behind Gibraltar rock. Near Mequinez and Fez, the harder bodies begin to appear: their &s;trata approach the &s;urface, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, form the great body of mountains that appear here in the di&s;tant view.</P>
<P>Some quarries of an indifferent kind of marble have been much worked near Me|quinez, and la&s;t by Muley I&s;hmael, with his numerous Chri&s;tian &s;laves, for his ex|ten&s;ive

<P>In the back parts of the&s;e plains, on ap|proaching the hills, we pa&s;&s;ed by large tracts where the upper &s;tratum con&s;i&s;ted of what we call plum-pudding &s;tone, often with earth or &s;and beneath.

<P>THERE are, I believe, &s;ome accounts of this country already publi&s;hed; but as I have hardly &s;een any of them, I mu&s;t run the ri&s;k of repeating what may have been written before; e&s;pecially in de&s;cend|ing to particulars, in which I do not, how|ever, profe&s;s to deal much.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of this kingdom, as far as the royal authority is known to reach, may be e&s;timated at about fifty thou&s;and &s;quare miles (England contains, I believe, forty-nine thou&s;and); taking its length to the river Suz, or about Teradaunt, as nearly five hundred, and its mean breadth about one hundred.</P>

<P>We may judge of his force and di&s;cipline by this late &s;iege of Ma&s;aghan.

They came &s;traggling in for many days during the fir&s;t of the &s;iege; and before the end of it, two months and a half, they were reducd to one-fourth or one-fifth of their greate&s;t number, all &s;tealing away when tired. Indeed they cannot, in any great numbers, &s;tay long in a place, the country and methods of provid|ing being inadequate; but this being by the &s;ea, he got &s;upplied for his money, though with &s;ome difficulty and great expence.

<P><PB N="100" REF="112">Their wants are few, and from the few arts nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply tho&s;e wants more hands can be &s;pared than with us. Half the able-bodied might perhaps take the field for a little time; whereas with us, I believe, one-eighth would be found too many to be &s;pared from the arts and trades that are wanted in our &s;tate of &s;ociety: but in theirs, the women, the aged, and the children, might nearly do the nece&s;&s;ary work in this climate during mo&s;t part of the year. Such a &s;tate, like &s;ome of the ancient republics, if it could be wi&s;ely governed and di&s;ciplined, might have great advantages, in national &s;trength, over more poli&s;hed and luxurious nations.</P>
<P>It is a great pity that the European powers are giving up or lo&s;ing the places they held on this African coa&s;t, in&s;tead of gaining more, as I think they ought. Tho&s;e places were a kind of military &s;chools ra|ther better than none; they produced &s;ome additional motives to military and national exertions; they &s;erved as &s;ome a&s;ylum, or hope for the e&s;cape of &s;laves and pri&s;oners; and in this and &s;everal other ways were a
<PB N="101" REF="113">
kind of check on the&s;e barbarians. The Portugue&s;e, in their more flouri&s;hing days, very properly con&s;idered them in this light, and as a footing towards the formation of future colonies here; in which it is to be hoped &s;ome European nation will yet again &s;ucceed as well as the Romans.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, in the principles of the pre&s;ent art of war, that ten thou&s;and men, trained on purpo&s;e under a good general, might beat as many as could be brought into the field of &s;uch troops as the&s;e, provided they had fir&s;t &s;ome experience in this kind of war; for without great precaution, our inexperience of barbarous armies and methods of war might expo&s;e us to &s;ome dangers at fir&s;t, and to misfortunes that might prove deci&s;ive. Though our &s;uperior &s;cience, patience, and di&s;cipline, when &s;kil|fully employed, ought to give us great advantages over &s;uch a rabble, yet the general who attacks or invades any of the&s;e Barbary &s;tates ought to be very much on his guard at fir&s;t, or his troops may be &s;ur|pri&s;ed. A&s;toni&s;hed at their unu&s;ual modes of
<PB N="102" REF="114">
attack; at the great agility of their hor&s;e in retreating, breaking, returning; at their horrid &s;hrieks and yells, of which we can have no idea, as our lungs are incapable of &s;uch exertions from want of habit, we &s;hould be apt to give way, which would be deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>No modern nation has yet found the &s;ecret of making either war or peace with them to any advantage proportioned to the difference of &s;cience and di&s;cipline. It is amazing, I believe even to them&s;elves, to &s;ee the nations of Europe, with all their &s;upe|riorities, become &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and tributary to them. We &s;eem to keep each other in countenance, and &s;hare the di&s;grace among&s;t us.</P>
<P>If Ru&s;&s;ia ever &s;ucceeds in her enterpri&s;es, and can get once fairly into the Mediterra|nean, &s;he may &s;hew us how to treat the&s;e piratical &s;tates; for &s;he has the only troops &s;ufficiently acquainted with &s;uch enemies, and &s;he will probably be wi&s;e enough to keep up that knowledge by frequent wars. Any
<PB N="103" REF="115">
other power who may have occa&s;ion to attack them would perhaps do well to borrow a Ru&s;|&s;ian general and &s;ome other of their officers.</P>
<P>To be conquered by a civilized and ge|nerous nation would be a happy event for the&s;e poor Africans. They have latterly been &s;aved from it&mdash;we can hardly tell how, or why, when we con&s;ider the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of modern Europe. It has probably been owing to our exhau&s;ting wars with each other, and to tho&s;e apparently greater objects of the We&s;tern and Ea&s;tern worlds, in &s;earch of gold. But it may ju&s;tly be doubted, if tho&s;e objects be greater? The&s;e northern parts of Africa are capable of all &s;orts of u&s;eful productions, of more value than gold, and nearer home.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that France may be approaching to a &s;tate of population and en|terpri&s;e that may make &s;uch colonization and conque&s;t occur and become nece&s;&s;ary to her, or at lea&s;t to join in &s;uch a &s;cheme, if it &s;hould once become the fa&s;hion. And if her go|vernment can ever be &s;teady enough, in any

&s;y&s;tem; or if &s;he &s;hould ever recover her con&s;titution, which &s;ome of their &s;peculative men think po&s;&s;ible, and which I do not think probable; &s;he would then be too powerful, and give law to Europe. Egypt ought, perhaps, to be the fir&s;t country in Africa to be conquered and coloni&s;ed from Europe, on account of its &s;ingular &s;ituation. Surrounded by de&s;erts, it would be ea&s;ily defended again&s;t all its neighbours. Wealthy, &s;cientific, and di&s;ciplined nations, are not in the&s;e days to be conquered by crowds of barbarians: the modern expen&s;ive &s;ciences of fortification, and war in general, form their &s;ecurity. Then the re&s;t of the northern African coa&s;t might be gradually &s;ubdued and civilized by &s;mall colonies and good government.

<P>Portugal, in the times of her &s;pirit, wi&s;|dom, and glory, during the reigns of her Johns and Emanuels, attempted conque&s;t and colonization here too; and with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, con&s;idering the times and circum&s;tances.

It is only war, or &s;ome &s;uch powerful mo|tive of nece&s;&s;ity, that can induce them to move with any order or exertion. So that, whenever the European nations can agree about the mea&s;ures and con&s;equences, they may probably do what they plea&s;e with both the European and African Mu&s;&s;ul|mans. Perhaps it may be brought about without France, or at lea&s;t without her tak|ing the lead in tho&s;e conque&s;ts.

There is no apparent revolution ari&s;ing in the horizon of future probability, of more importance to this part of the world, and to the improvement of mankind, in that of their commerce, population, arts, and indu&s;try. The practicability and utility of &s;uch mea&s;ures may be perceived from the

hi&s;tory of Carthage, of Rome, and of Portugal. The&s;e countries have always received co|lonies, and have been improved by them; it is of con&s;equence, that they &s;hould come from the mo&s;t improved nations. Maho|medan conque&s;t from A&s;ia having &s;pread it&s;elf along this fine African coa&s;t, and its being left there &s;o long to degenerate, and then to infe&s;t and plague the re&s;t of the world, is a great &s;hame to poli&s;hed Europe. But &s;he mu&s;t probably, in time, recover and a&s;&s;ert her natural &s;uperiority here too, as the Mahomedan power of it&s;elf declines.

<P>When governments &s;hall have learned to act on great and liberal principles, and &s;hall have taught mankind to tolerate and enrich each other, Mahomedans may make better &s;ubjects when &s;ubordinate than when in power. Tho&s;e who were left in Spain and

<P>"We mu&s;t go on endeavouring, by de|grees, to get the people to continue &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to the authority, or at lea&s;t to follow the advice, of the chiefs and elders of the villages, in peace as well as in war, by giving them the election of tho&s;e in a pro|per form and rotation; carefully &s;ecuring the obedience of tho&s;e chiefs or elders, by giving them an intere&s;t and a &s;hare in the

Though the intere&s;t of the whole, and of each individual, is always to be comparative|ly con&s;idered and e&s;timated; though public mea&s;ures and nece&s;&s;ary improvements will gradually require more thought, knowledge, and regulation; yet you mu&s;t carefully avoid making your laws and government too complicated, but pre&s;erve the whole in that &s;imple and plain &s;tate &s;o as to be ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood by all. Simplicity is not to be &s;acri|ficed to trifling amendments. A wheel too

much will &s;poil any machine. While you make few laws, and tru&s;t each other, you will exerci&s;e and &s;trengthen the be&s;t parts of your nature, a certain confidence and be|nevolence; and you will at lea&s;t be longer in becoming unworthy of that tru&s;t.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XVIII.</HI> Political Opinions and Advice.</HEAD>
<P>I AM obliged to you for putting me in mind. I did intend to give you &s;ome more memorandums of this country, moral and political; but as their importance &s;eems to dimini&s;h as our departure approaches, I fear many of them are forgotten.</P>
<P>This Emperor, though of an indolent di&s;po&s;ition, like mo&s;t of his countrymen, is neverthele&s;s of an anxious mind, a re&s;tle&s;s and perpetual negociator; and he means never to let you re&s;t, more than his own &s;ubjects: you mu&s;t be always expecting &s;ome emba&s;&s;y, me&s;&s;age, or demand from him. When every thing el&s;e &s;eems to be &s;ettled, he will probably make &s;ome alteration on your duties, and may double them at once, though you already think them too high. That will occa&s;ion fre&s;h negocia|tions,
<PB N="152" REF="164">
emba&s;&s;ies, pre&s;ents; all of which &s;eem to be as the nece&s;&s;aries of life to him; and he will generally take care to create motives and occa&s;ions for them.</P>
<P>In dealing with the&s;e people, there can hardly be any general rule of conduct. They are generally both capricious and de|ceitful. We mu&s;t follow them as well as we can, and, like them&s;elves, go on with temporary &s;hifts, and take occa&s;ional mea|&s;ures, as it were from hand to mouth. You have put up with affronts enough to &s;how that you do not mean to quarrel with him, &s;o that you mu&s;t expect many more affronts and demands.</P>
<P>He has been more afraid of you than of any other power, which he will not readily forgive. He will probably take every oc|ca&s;ion to &s;how that you are not now his <HI>only friends,</HI> as heretofore; and he &s;eems highly plea&s;ed at having e&s;caped out of that &s;itua|tion. He de&s;ired the interpreter to tell me the other day, <HI>apropos</HI> to nothing, that the pride of the Engli&s;h is &s;oon to be taken

down. We know the Bourbons have been telling him &s;o, and will be attentive to keep him up in that hope and idea. Indeed mo&s;t nations are now vying with each other for the highe&s;t place in his favour, and the chief object of all is, to &s;upplant us; and they will now ea&s;ily &s;ucceed. We are all his tributaries. Such is the di&s;grace|ful policy of the times with regard to the&s;e piratical &s;tates, and which may la&s;t till &s;ome event &s;hall happen to make us all a&s;hamed of our&s;elves. Nations are not a&s;hamed to follow each other in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful politics, though &s;o tardy in borrowing any u&s;eful art or practice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e late treaties of this Emperor with the other Chri&s;tian powers were &s;o un|popular here, that it required a great deal of money, and all the arts of a mo&s;t artful and de&s;potic prince, to make them go down with the people.</P>
<P>I believe we might, with more &s;afety than any other nation, a&s;&s;i&s;t him to improve his force and his country, if that were prac|ticable.
<PB N="154" REF="166">
They would not probably venture to attack us, and would then be better cu&s;tomers than they can ever be while they remain poor, indolent, and uncivilized. But there are likewi&s;e times when they &s;hould be checked: the remembrance of the la&s;t war we had with them la&s;ted a long time, and indeed is not yet quite worn out of their memory: it has long helped to keep them in order, and to maintain among them a certain re&s;pect and dread of the Engli&s;h navy.</P>
<P>The&s;e Moors, though confined in their knowledge, have often great natural &s;aga|city and penetration, and know a character at &s;ight, full as well as any of us. Aware of Barbarian cunning, we mu&s;t be con|&s;tantly on our guard, and be ready to give up, in a moment, the mo&s;t favourite and long-laboured plans or objects of negocia|tion, di&s;concerted by their penetration, their artifice, or barbarity.</P>
<P>As to their commerce, you may there know it nearly enough. You will &s;ee it can
<PB N="155" REF="167">
be of no great importance to us, or to any other nation, except to your garri&s;on. They have had of late as far as thirty &s;hips an|nually, mo&s;tly Engli&s;h, loaded at their we&s;tern ports. That trade might indeed &s;oon be doubled, and trebled, by a better kind of government, and more of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have had two more conver&s;ations with the Prince, and had the good fortune to fix his attention longer than I ever &s;aw it fixed before, except to foot-ball, or &s;hooting at a mark. Some of his que&s;tions were curious for their &s;agacity, and others for their &s;im|plicity and ignorance. He believes they are to &s;et about conquering Chri&s;tendom after they have &s;ettled certain dome&s;tic affairs; and he has no doubt of &s;ucceeding, when they can bring all their force to act. I find that, notwith&s;tanding their clo&s;e friend&s;hip with <HI>Carlos,</HI> they mean &s;oon to attack &s;ome of his fortre&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIX.</HI> Of the Emperor, his Character, Government, Policy, and their Effects.&mdash;Of the Moors, and of national Characters.&mdash;Of Ju&s;tice, Government, and State of Society.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Emperor under&s;tands the Moors perfectly; but his genius or character is not well calculated to make the mo&s;t of theirs. His mode of government, his per|petual rapacity, is more di&s;gu&s;ting to them, and perhaps more hurtful to population, and to the nece&s;&s;ary improvements, than all the cruelty of his predece&s;&s;ors. But that is exactly what he means: to impoveri&s;h and depopulate the country is his object. De&s;|poti&s;m cannot bear the pro&s;perity of its &s;ubjects, and &s;eems to wi&s;h they all had but one neck, to be cut off at one blow.</P>
<P>A cruel and unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition, in both ma&s;ter and &s;lave, is perhaps the natural pro|duce of this &s;pecies of government. A
<PB N="157" REF="169">
much le&s;s degree of uncertainty in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, or of the fruits of their labour, would be &s;ufficient to damp or repel all the activity and indu&s;try of men. The &s;ubordinate members mu&s;t follow the head; and all mu&s;t be rapacious and perfidious. Such, to many people, &s;eems to be the character of the Moors, given them by na|ture; but it is only the produce of their government. I believe they did not merit this character during their be&s;t times in Spain.</P>
<P>This Emperor being more humane than mo&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors, and of a different character, perhaps de&s;erves to be con&s;idered with more attention. But he means not, as many imagine, to encourage arts and in|du&s;try, nor military merit, nor any other merit. It is only his avarice that makes him agree to the&s;e uncon&s;titutional truces with the Chri&s;tian powers, which, by open|ing the ports for the &s;ake of duties, has given an appearance of &s;ome commerce, but which the &s;ame avarice will again &s;oon check or de&s;troy by oppre&s;&s;ion. He is even
<PB N="158" REF="170">
afraid of any degree of merit or popularity in any of his &s;ubjects; and when he pro|fe&s;&s;es to e&s;teem and encourage it, he means only to deceive. He is cunning and artful, probably both from natural character and from long habit; perhaps originally from nece&s;&s;ity. The degree of that nece&s;&s;ity we cannot ea&s;ily judge of.</P>
<P>His plan of government, if a &s;et of wretched &s;hifts and rapacious oppre&s;&s;ion de&s;erve the name of plan, is generally &s;imple, and has but one object in view; but <HI>that</HI> he endeavours to conceal, and to ren|der his proceedings complex and crooked, without any apparent nece&s;&s;ity, avoiding all appearance of rule or method, perplexed and my&s;tical without a cau&s;e, as if to keep up the habit, or merely for the malicious plea&s;ure of deceiving.</P>
<P>Though de&s;truction is always the object, or the means employed by this kind of government, this man's method of accom|pli&s;hing it is different from tho&s;e formerly in u&s;e. The plan or object which he has
<PB N="159" REF="171">
always in view, is no other than to draw the greate&s;t part of the money of his domi|nions into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which at once &s;atisfies his pa&s;&s;ion, and impoveri&s;hes and weakens the people, that he may govern them the ea&s;ier. And he &s;ucceeds in it to an amazing degree, con&s;idering the Moori&s;h arts and avarice he has to deal with.</P>
<P>But after all the&s;e precautions, and the con&s;equences of extreme internal weakne&s;s and poverty, we find that &s;uch countries are not therefore much le&s;s &s;ubject to violent and de&s;tructive revolutions. It is the vigi|lance of the monarch, more than the de|bility of the people, which &s;aves them from tho&s;e tumultuous rebellions, and pretenders to the throne, to which they have been formerly &s;o much accu&s;tomed. Their hi&s;tory is full of perpetual tumults, ma&s;&s;acres, and civil wars. There has hardly been a peace|able &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before this, nor &s;o long a peace as during this reign, which is cer|tainly much to the credit of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and ought to place his name very
<PB N="160" REF="172">
high in their annals&mdash;if they had any body to write them.</P>
<P>De&s;olation and mi&s;ery, however, &s;eem everywhere to increa&s;e, in &s;pite of all their peace and commerce. Whole &s;uburbs and villages are gradually falling to ruins. Large tracts of country, formerly occupied and cultivated by M. I&s;hmael's black colo|nies, lie now in barren wa&s;te. And it ap|pears, that the country flouri&s;hed more under that piratical and mercile&s;s tyrant, than it does under the humane and com|mercial, but avaricious, Cidi Mahomet.</P>
<P>The people are probably right in wi&s;h|ing for war, as it makes them of &s;ome con&s;equence to their ma&s;ter; and &s;uch people may certainly gain more by piracy than they do now by commerce or indu&s;try. Nay, they are probably incapable of either, beyond a certain degree of what is barely nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence. If a country could po&s;&s;ibly improve under &s;uch a government, we &s;hould have &s;een here &s;ome &s;igns of it
<PB N="161" REF="173">
before this, during this peaceable reign, now above a dozen years. This monarch has never, &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion, had any thing to fear; yet he is &s;aid, by tho&s;e who know him be&s;t, to pa&s;s his time in con&s;tant fear and anxiety. The nature or turn of his policy and mode of government proceeds from his character; and that you have &s;een formed in his youth, as u&s;ual, by various circum&s;tances. Long driven about the kingdom with his father, by competitors and rebellion; expo&s;ed to continual dan|gers, treachery, and alarms, he &s;eems to have acquired an habitual horror of all the&s;e, and fancies that his &s;afety mu&s;t con|&s;i&s;t in the mi&s;ery and weakne&s;s of his people. He endeavours to reconcile them to the&s;e unpopular mea&s;ures of peace, by &s;hewing them the guns, mortars, and batteries, which he gains from tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, (poor fools!) and by which they them&s;elves are all to be conquered &s;ome day or other.</P>
<P>But every &s;hip of war that appears on his coa&s;t he &s;ees fraught with double danger. In the de&s;truction of any of the&s;e batteries,
<PB N="162" REF="174">
he fears the ma&s;k would be removed, the people undeceived; and hence rebellion, de|throning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and more e&s;pecially if the &s;hips be Engli&s;h, whom he hates as he dreads. He is ob&s;erved to be very unea&s;y, and does not probably &s;leep well, during all the time any of our &s;hips are on his coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Moors, it is true, are quick, fiery, and impatient, treacherous and cruel, and require now to be governed with a rod of iron, which mu&s;t be kept con&s;tantly in their &s;ight. When once they begin to ri&s;e, and can find a leader, as in mo&s;t de&s;potic countries, they pre&s;ently go to all the extremes of de&s;perate cruelty and de&s;olation. Some very trifling matter is &s;ufficient, at times, to &s;et them all up in armed confu&s;ion. This was indeed nearly the ca&s;e lately, from a &s;hort illne&s;s of his maje&s;ty: they already began to fancy he was dead, and his death concealed; and he, on hearing that gun|powder had &s;uddenly ri&s;en to double its u&s;ual price, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew him&s;elf, though &s;till very ill.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="175">A great part of the peculiar character of each people may proceed from climate and particular phy&s;ical cau&s;es, though it is dif|ficult to e&s;timate how much; and we &s;hall all continue to have different &s;y&s;tems and opinions concerning tho&s;e things. We know, however, that laws, in&s;titutions, manners, and cu&s;toms, will in time prevail over tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which we &s;uppo&s;e given by nature; and that the character of a nation, at di&s;tant periods, may be very different.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e find a great re&s;emblance among very di&s;tant nations, while in the rude or early &s;tages of &s;ociety. But arts, civilization, and modes of government, lead them often as it were in oppo&s;ite di|rections, and pre&s;ently create &s;triking differ|ences between them. The Greeks, Phoe|nicians, Carthaginians, and Arabs, have all been great nations, though of very different characters, and yet were all probably formed from nearly the &s;ame kind of original ma|terials, from people very like the&s;e Moors. However, the&s;e African nations &s;eem gene|rally
<PB N="164" REF="176">
to have pre&s;erved a certain &s;amene&s;s of character in many points, through all pe|riods of their hi&s;tory. They &s;eem always to have con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;ame kind of quick and volatile, but weak and combu&s;tible, materials. As troops, we &s;hall find them &s;till the &s;ame kind of fiery, irregular, de&s;ul|tory light-hor&s;e, as the Numidians and Mauritanians probably were in the time of the Romans, if we make allowance for the colouring and dignity of the Roman hi&s;|torians. They might, even now, &s;oon be made capable of powerful &s;udden attacks, but not of any great and continued efforts. They could never probably be made to &s;upport any &s;y&s;tem of conduct long with &s;ufficient patience and firmne&s;s. Oppo&s;ed to a &s;teady di&s;ciplined army, their barbarian impatience would &s;oon appear, and give to a vigilant enemy deci&s;ive advantages. Na|turally &s;agacious, quick, and intelligent, they might &s;oon be taught, to a certain de|gree, how to make u&s;e of their natural advantages; but all would as &s;oon be ne|glected and forgotten again, if not kept up by con&s;tant di&s;cipline, of which the Maho|metans
<PB N="165" REF="177">
in general are probably incapable; &mdash;thoughtle&s;s and improvident, yet rapaci|ous and avaricious: the incon&s;i&s;tencies of human nature are every where numerous; in this &s;tate of &s;ociety they are more re|markable, and different from tho&s;e of civil|ization. Though frightened into rea&s;on to-day, to-morrow they forget their danger, and carele&s;sly return to their former habits, though a&s;&s;ured they will fail of &s;ucce&s;s. Here are no permanent ranks of people or of families, nor difference of manners; all are equally good company. De&s;poti&s;m brings all to a level, and that level is near the meane&s;t of the &s;pecies. A government, where all the vices of human nature are the natural produce, mu&s;t create a re&s;emblance of character throughout the individuals, and between all &s;uch countries, however di&s;tant.</P>
<P>My guide, and protector on this journey, one of the emperor's friends, is now em|ployed in pre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es for us, and in let|ting them free again, for payment. His toil and indu&s;try have been amazing in this
<PB N="166" REF="178">way, letting no opportunity e&s;cape him of making a blankil&equals;2&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> The Moori&s;h avarice is far beyond ours, and we &s;hould think they might therefore be made indu&s;|trious, though now of &s;o oppo&s;ite a cha|racter. After he has made what he can in this way, then I mu&s;t pay the hire at a very dear rate, which is al&s;o mo&s;tly his profit; and there is no remedy but pa|tience. Ju&s;tice is &s;o far from being ready and ea&s;y here, that people chu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t violent outrages rather than apply for it; and now it is only to be had at the capital, from his maje&s;ty, and very uncertain even there. It &s;hould not &s;ur|pri&s;e us to find the people &s;o bad; it is rather a&s;toni&s;hing they are not wor&s;e. There is le&s;s robbing on the roads during this reign than formerly, as this monarch will admit of no robbers be&s;ides him&s;elf, unle&s;s he is well paid for the li|cence, which is yet done &s;ometimes in par|ticular ca&s;es, though not &s;o much as u&s;ual. On this principle the ba&s;haw may pillage what he plea&s;es, provided he carries it all to his ma&s;ter, for &s;haring it with him is
<PB N="167" REF="179">
not &s;ufficient. Indeed that re&s;pectable ma|gi&s;trate generally takes care to purloin a little for him&s;elf, though he knows it will be taken from him with &s;evere puni&s;hment. In &s;hort, it is here where the &s;trong may oppre&s;s the weak&mdash;the Moor may beat and rob the poor Jew, who dares not complain for many rea&s;ons. All &s;poils become lawful when a &s;ufficient &s;hare goes to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible for even a tenth part of the ju&s;tice nece&s;&s;ary in a great kingdom to proceed from the throne, a rapacious rabble of the friends and attendants of royalty &s;ur|round and intercept it. In &s;uch a &s;tate there mu&s;t always be more than &s;ufficient examples of impunity and inju&s;tice, to en|courage many attempts to do evil.</P>
<P>In the rude &s;tate, while property is yet in&s;ecure or undivided, certain crimes and vices, as theft or robbery, are not con&s;idered in the &s;ame degree of turpitude as among a &s;ettled and civilized people. Declining na|tions are probably wor&s;e, weaker, and more vicious, than tho&s;e that are ri&s;ing, though near the &s;ame &s;tate of ignorance. In the
<PB N="168" REF="180">
ri&s;ing &s;tate, they may help one another up; in the other, they pull each other down: &s;o where there is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for private virtues, for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, there is the lea&s;t to be found. Friend&s;hip and fidelity are &s;ometimes the produce of oppre&s;&s;ion, which pre&s;&s;es men as it were clo&s;er together for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance or defence; but when that is once given up and de&s;paired of, &s;o|ciety is in a manner di&s;&s;olved; every virtue, humanity it&s;elf, is de&s;troyed; di&s;tru&s;t or malevolence breaks all the u&s;ual bonds of union: accordingly we find here hardly any moral &s;en&s;e of right and wrong. We find they all con&s;ider each other as per|fectly perfidious.&mdash;All wi&s;h to oppre&s;s and rob in their turn. They con&s;ider their be|ing detected only as a misfortune.</P>
<P>You may well be &s;urpri&s;ed how &s;ociety, in &s;uch a &s;tate, can exi&s;t for any time, if it can be &s;aid to exi&s;t as a &s;ociety; it may be con&s;idered rather as a &s;tate of warfare. All tends here to produce a di&s;mal kind of un|certainty which hangs over life, and &s;tifles in embryo almo&s;t every voluntary exertion, and which brings all to a certain degree of
<PB N="169" REF="181">
meanne&s;s, of debility, dejection, or vice&mdash; to a &s;tate with which we are unacquainted, and which is therefore worth our con&s;ider|ing; but that degree is, I think, &s;eldom &s;o great as might be expected: no principles or moral cau&s;es ever go &s;o far in practice, nor have all the influence which they &s;eem, in &s;peculation, calculated to produce. Some di&s;tant hope of change, or of e&s;caping un|noticed in the crowd, even the thoughtle&s;s and incon&s;iderate nature of men, all help to carry them on, and induce them to hoard up even what they know will be taken from them&mdash;to take wives and e&s;tabli&s;h families; and to try, as they are hurried on through life, like the flocks on their journey, to &s;natch a mouthful of ea&s;e or en|joyment as they pa&s;s. Happily, many things tend to keep men nearer to an equality in happine&s;s than appearances indicate.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the mountainous parts of this country, where this government does not reach, the people &s;eem better, more indu&s;trious, &s;teady, and provident, in their poor little way of life. They have fixed
<PB N="170" REF="182">
habitations, little cottages and gardens, and in tolerable order; &s;o that there mu&s;t be &s;ome hone&s;ty, good faith, and mutual a&s;|&s;i&s;tance among them; and hence it is plain, that &s;uch a government as this is wor&s;e than none.</P>
<P>A violent and tyrannic government is generally a weak one. It never has in fact half the power it pretends to exerci&s;e.&mdash; Moving by fits and &s;tarts, in no &s;ettled walk or &s;y&s;tem; by turns all violence, or all lethargy; the parts of the confu&s;ed ma|chine are not fitted nor ready to obey, &s;o that all its efforts &s;hew either a wa&s;te or a want of power, and its greate&s;t exertions tend only to de&s;truction. The de&s;pot can de&s;troy, but can &s;eldom be obeyed, as he de&s;ires. On &s;eeing this emperor's orders often di&s;puted at his very gates, it gives an Engli&s;hman plea&s;ure to recollect that our laws are better obeyed and executed in our remote&s;t dominions, than tho&s;e of the ty|rant in his own capital.</P>

In the moun|tains, and in the country, men make their own &s;hoes, furniture, and uten&s;ils, which in the towns is the work of &s;eparate pro|fe&s;&s;ions. Many &s;eem to pa&s;s their time

chiefly between &s;itting, &s;moking, and &s;leep|ing, all of which they prolong much be|yond what is u&s;ual in Europe. How &s;o many can be maintained in idlene&s;s, and by what labour, of which &s;o little is to be &s;een in the country, can only be accounted for from their wants being few.</P>
<P>Sometimes they take fits of riding, which they perform in the other extreme of rude exertion, u&s;ing the poor hor&s;e with a roughne&s;s and violence fitter for a wild bea&s;t that they wi&s;hed to tame, with a bridle and &s;purs of a tremendous and cruel con&s;truction, which pre&s;ently make his mouth and &s;ides run with blood. The&s;e riding-&s;its which they &s;ometimes take, &s;eem|ingly <HI>a-propos</HI> to nothing, they con&s;ider as a kind of war-exerci&s;e: the moment any of the&s;e fellows gets upon a hor&s;e, he thinks of &s;ighting, and begins to go through the motions of it, brandi&s;hing and attacking in their way, &s;o that you would think him half mad. Individually they may be con|&s;idered as tolerably good light-hor&s;e, or ra|ther as materials <HI>pour en faire,</HI> if they could
<PB N="174" REF="186">
be brought to any regularity and uniformity in their movements, in &s;ome of which they are &s;ingly very dexterous: their methods of attack, with their crooked &s;words, the va|riety and frequency of their charges, might be made to have great effect, e&s;pecially on troops unaccu&s;tomed to them. I believe General Seidlitz borrowed many of his ex|cellent ideas of cavalry from Turks and Tartars, &s;uch troops as the&s;e. They have no idea of any regular drill or exerci&s;e. They &s;ometimes fire and throw darts at a mark&mdash;generally at an earthen pot or a blown bladder, very near, under fifty yards. But their boar-hunt is a fine manly diver|&s;ion. Their foot-ball, or <HI>pallone,</HI> as in Italy, is good exerci&s;e. Some jugglers and &s;tory|tellers, who exhibit &s;ometimes to the crowd on a market-day, form the &s;um of their public diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>The be&s;t part of this government is the continuance of the old and warlike practice of the prince or chief appearing frequently among his people on hor&s;eback: it is now become a regular audience or levee two or
<PB N="175" REF="187">
three times a week; a thing &s;o unexpected in &s;uch a country. This cu&s;tom &s;erves to check &s;o many abu&s;es, and to keep &s;o many people in awe, that I &s;uppo&s;e this kind of government could not go on without it. Under a really great and wi&s;e prince it might be made the means of doing much good; arts, indu&s;try, public virtue, might thereby perhaps be con&s;iderably promoted, all in their own &s;imple and direct manner. If it were po&s;&s;ible for uncontrolled power to be &s;teady, uniform, or con&s;i&s;tent, in its proceedings; if the&s;e general orders of the emperor, i&s;&s;ued verbally at levees, pro|ceeded from a wi&s;e and connected plan, and were firmly carried into execution; they might in time have almo&s;t the force of laws, and might extend much farther throughout the country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the great advantages of military orders, in prompti|tude and obedience; but, alas! no human individual, and &s;till le&s;s a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, can probably ever be found equal to &s;uch a &s;ituation as his.

His phy&s;ician, your poor Portugue&s;e doctor, Don Juan, we hear will be in danger if this prince dies; it &s;eems it is not uncommon here to put a doctor to death for letting his patient die&mdash;if a prince or a great man.</P>

But few or none of their cu&s;toms can be of much importance to us, where none have a tendency or lead to virtue, which indeed would not only be u&s;ele&s;s but obnoxious here, and for which we cannot find there is any term in their language.</P>
<P>The re&s;pect they pay to the memory of their &s;aints might be well, were it for any thing but folly, or rather an artful imbe|cility, by which tho&s;e people enjoy a kind of liberty of doing what they plea&s;e, and &s;eem to have great influence: their folly, which is generally I believe affected, is con|&s;idered as a kind of in&s;piration; it runs in families&mdash;but you know the particulars.

<P>You &s;ee &s;omething like religion; and prie&s;ts &s;eem fortunately always to obtain &s;ome influence over men through all the &s;tages of &s;ociety, and more e&s;pecially in its earlier periods, for which indeed it &s;eems more peculiarly adapted, as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplement to the defects of law and order; and it mu&s;t continue to be always a good appendix to the code whenever it can be kept within bounds, or reformed and cur|tailed of &s;uperfluous power when nece&s;&s;ary. As the code of laws and modes of educa|tion become more perfect, the nece&s;&s;ity for a &s;uper&s;titious and all-governing religion probably dimini&s;hes; and the authority of its profe&s;&s;ors &s;hould be carefully regulated and re&s;trained within bounds while it is practicable, and before they gain a head of power not afterwards to be controlled. You know &s;ome other nations have not been &s;o fortunate as ours in this re&s;pect. Here their religion &s;eems to have yet too much
<PB N="179" REF="191">
influence on their manners, opinions, and conduct; it makes them hate all the re&s;t of mankind, and occupies too much of their time.</P>
<P>Religious &s;anctuaries here &s;ometimes &s;top the hand of bloody and rapacious tyranny, and tend to le&s;&s;en the effects of private re|venge, as it is u&s;ual for people to take re|fuge there again&s;t their enemies, who are generally obliged to re&s;pect them, and &s;ome|times again&s;t the &s;overeign him&s;elf, though he does not always re&s;pect them. The effects of them might be of &s;ome benefit, if they could be made to protect the inno|cent and not the guilty, as is pretended; but we know ca&s;es to the contrary, and it is notorious that the guilty have been there protected as in Spain, and that the inno|cent have been given up to the &s;uperior power of the de&s;pot, whenever his intere&s;t or his pa&s;&s;ions required it.</P>
<P>If one of the&s;e &s;aints, by &s;ome fortunate chain of circum&s;tances, were to turn out to be a man of genius and information, he
<PB N="180" REF="192">
might do what he plea&s;ed with &s;uch a people; he might improve, reform, and new-model, the whole nation and its go|vernment. The improbability of &s;uch a one ever being produced here bani&s;hes the idea of &s;peculating upon it. But as we become intere&s;ted in our own &s;peculations, we can|not help looking forward with a degree of plea&s;ure, and hope to &s;ome future period of conque&s;t or colonization of this country again from Europe; and yet upon reflec|tion we may fear it is &s;till far di&s;tant. We have not yet, I fear, got near enough to the termination of the long period of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and fanatici&s;m, and we mu&s;t pro|bably wait for that of rea&s;on before &s;uch events can be produced. Though the Ma|homedan conque&s;ts and e&s;tabli&s;hment are not perhaps &s;o firm and intimate here as generally imagined, and might be rather ea&s;ily overturned by certain operations from the north, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by colonies from the &s;outh; but mankind, during this yet fanatical <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever we may think of our&s;elves and the north of Europe, Mahomedi&s;m and the &s;outh of Europe certainly &s;till de&s;erve the epithet of <HI>fanatical.</HI></NOTE>

The difficulties generally proceed from their differing in religious opinions. Were it not for the barbarous inveteracy of Mahomedi&s;m, we might hope in time to &s;ee it wear down by the arts of peace, and give way to the weight of its own ab&s;urdities. Its future hi&s;tory cannot yet well be fore&s;een; it &s;eems doubtful if it can ever again become &s;ufficiently ra|tional and tolerant to admit of the nece&s;&s;ary improvements in arts and government; or if it mu&s;t go in ignorance and barbarity, and at la&s;t decline by its own corruption and incon&s;i&s;tencies, till &s;upplanted by &s;ome new &s;y&s;tem of fanatici&s;m. There is no giving Mahomedans any ideas of liberty or good government as yet, for they have no notion of &s;overeignty without de&s;potic power.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="194">To &s;ecure and to civilize this country, I believe it mu&s;t be done by military colo|nies &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Romans: I wi&s;h you could &s;earch and find out all the internal police, manners, and management, of tho&s;e. Let us &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch colonization to happen in our time, or that we are go|ing to &s;et about it: &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions will quicken your diligence.

If I were to have any hand in their formation, I &s;hould probably in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome which may appear to you &s;in|gularities&mdash;I &s;hould imitate Penn, and have no &s;tate religion, but &s;ecure a complete to|leration and protection to all &s;ects&mdash;I &s;hould have more women, and give them more to &s;ay and to do in &s;uch colonies than may corre&s;pond with your ideas of military or even of civil life&mdash;I &s;hould be for the &s;exes living and acting almo&s;t perpetually toge|ther, both in public and private, as the fir&s;t requi&s;ite towards civilization, e&s;pecially in this country; they &s;hould neither eat, drink,

<P>The importance of this great continent or penin&s;ula of Africa is obvious, and its being as yet &s;o little known or improved is equally &s;urpri&s;ing; however, many parts of it are known to be capable of every kind of produce, and may yet again &s;upply Europe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with many things better than now by di&s;tant colonies.</P>
<P>The native and natural race of man throughout this great continent is probably the <HI>black,</HI> of two kinds, the woolly-headed on one &s;ide of the penin&s;ula, and the long|haired on the other, except tho&s;e of Atlas and the northern coa&s;t, where they were

We might there di&s;cover many objects of curio&s;ity and of utility&mdash;in tho&s;e of nature and of antiquity&mdash;in Roman and Carthaginian remains&mdash;in the different lan|guages and races of people&mdash;perhaps the Punic language. When this country was better peopled and more productive, the communication between the northern and &s;outhern coa&s;ts, and with &s;ome of the in|ternal parts, was probably much greater than we yet know or can trace. Carthage po&s;&s;ibly drew much of her wealth and greatne&s;s from that &s;ource. In Tunis, and the country around it, they &s;ay a &s;pirit of commerce and indu&s;try is &s;till percep|tible.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="197">We do not here perceive any reality in the &s;uppo&s;ed inferiority of the black race to the white, but often the contrary; &s;ome of the be&s;t officers, farmers, workmen, of this empire, and I believe of &s;everal others, have been of that race.

well as of other human beings; but the world wants yet more knowledge and ex|perience on this &s;ubject, and we &s;hould re|quire much more re&s;idence and more atten|tion to determine any thing in it: this is certainly one of the be&s;t countries for that purpo&s;e; here all the various races and co|lours of men are nearly on the &s;ame footing of e&s;timation, unle&s;s they happen to be Jews or Chri&s;tians, and they may be con|&s;idered and compared in all the different &s;tations that this &s;tate of &s;ociety affords, from the ba&s;haw or general down to the menial &s;lave: in our i&s;lands and colonies we &s;ee the blacks only in the &s;tate of &s;lavery, which produces always a di&s;tinct and &s;imilar character.</P>

If the

Chri&s;tian powers had continued to increa&s;e and improve their garri&s;ons and ports on this coa&s;t; they might by this time have &s;erved as places of trade and friendly in|tercour&s;e in times of peace, or of a&s;ylum, or as military &s;chools, in ca&s;e of war: the people around would have liked them for the &s;ame rea&s;ons that the people of all the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Spain and Portugal like to have the Engli&s;h at Gibraltar.</P>
<P>But this government can never probably be &s;ufficiently &s;ettled to undertake or fini&s;h any public works that require much time; hardly any of the&s;e emperors have of late been able to fini&s;h even a hou&s;e to live in. This one mounted the throne with the rare advantage of having no competitor, being an only &s;on; an advantage which his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, whoever he may be, will not likely enjoy: his more &s;avage &s;ons may probably vie with each other for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as u&s;ual, and again drench the country in blood, and in all the horrors of a civil war.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="200">Such are &s;ome of the ob&s;ervations and ideas that have occurred of the condition of mankind, on examining and comparing the people of the&s;e and other regions&mdash; of their arts, ignorance, opinions, manners, characters, prejudices.

<DATELINE>St. Omer, <DATE>1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are always ready enough to be|lieve our own di&s;coveries of im|portance, and are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded that the re&s;ult of our labours and experience may
<PB N="192" REF="203">
be of &s;ervice, at lea&s;t to our friends. You are probably right in conceiving that I re|quire &s;ome encouragement. Your flatter|ing reque&s;t and remarks tend to rai&s;e the&s;e of mine into &s;ome new con&s;equence in my own eyes, and may induce me to take more pains in future, and endeavour to retain for you &s;ome more of tho&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions as a traveller, which, I agree with you, are not always the wor&s;t, nor the lea&s;t worth pre|&s;erving.</P>
<P>Of the different countries I vi&s;it, I have neither time nor intention to trouble you with much of the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable &s;tyle of <HI>minutiae</HI> in natural hi&s;tory or antiquities, nor to give you an itinerary catalogue of all the &s;ights to be &s;een. Without &s;ome object or principle in view, the daily accumulation of little facts and particulars tends only to increa&s;e the perplexity and confu&s;ion, or to enlarge the hoards preparing for future and uncertain theories, which may yet long con|tinue to &s;ucceed each other, and to perplex mankind before they arrive at the <HI>truths of importance.</HI> I like be&s;t the theory or &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="193" REF="204">
which is formed on the &s;pot, with the knowledge of the facts; tho&s;e framed in our clo&s;ets are generally wrong. Of the two cla&s;&s;es of objects in this world, men and things, I think the latter occupies too much the attention of travellers, to the neglect of the former, which is certainly the mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>We have only to look round us in a few different countries to &s;ee that on govern|ment and legi&s;lation depends the greate&s;t part of the happine&s;s of mankind; and yet the&s;e important objects &s;eem now the lea&s;t attended to by our modern travellers; nay, they are in &s;ome danger of being entirely excluded, under the now di&s;graceful name of politics, from our catalogue of &s;ubjects of enquiry. The &s;ages of antiquity&mdash;an Herodotus, a Pythagoras, a Lycurgus&mdash; thought otherwi&s;e; to ob&s;erve the laws, con&s;titutions, and manners, of other coun|tries, in order to improve their own, were then thought to be motives of travel worthy of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t men.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="205">In &s;hort, I am habitually inclined to con|&s;ider man as always the fir&s;t object of at|tention, and other things in &s;ome propor|tion to their connection with him; not that I intend to attempt any thing like a complete account of any nation or people: A few &s;hort &s;ketches and reflections on the men or things, as they may chance to &s;trike me where I travel or re&s;ide, I mean to con|tinue; and with as much caution as prac|ticable again&s;t natural or habitual prejudices, I mean to attempt at once to give you &s;uch truths as may &s;eem to me of importance enough for your notice and mine&mdash;life be|ing too &s;hort to form voluminous collections of little facts, and wait for the conclu&s;ions of philo&s;ophers thereon. If I can &s;ome|times &s;ucceed in pointing out the right road or proper object to be pur&s;ued in travelling, I &s;hall not think my labour lo&s;t.</P>
<P>We need not fear that the &s;ubjects for ob&s;ervation are yet nearly exhau&s;ted: you future travellers may comfort your&s;elves that much real information is yet to be ga|thered even in the mo&s;t beaten paths of

your predece&s;&s;ors, and you may know that nations have hardly begun to learn wi&s;dom of each other, and that none of them are yet &s;ufficiently acquainted, mixed, and con|nected, to be much benefited by their re|&s;pective improvements; but as they mix and become more intimately united, the better it will be for the whole; &s;o that we are every way encouraged and invited by nature to travel and mingle with each other, and this is much better than reading about one another in books, from which I wi&s;h you to beware of expecting too much; they may direct you to u&s;eful and real knowledge, but can &s;eldom &s;upply its place; on them may be built a large and nece&s;&s;ary part of the &s;tructure of education, but not the whole, as &s;ome of our learned I fear are too apt to imagine: to know, we mu&s;t &s;ee at lea&s;t: in many things reading will give but imperfect ideas, and particularly in ob|jects of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Of the French nation I &s;hall give you only a few remarks <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI> Stationed in the centre of the civilized world, their
<PB N="196" REF="207">
character, hi&s;tory, and their influence, are too generally known and felt to require much more illu&s;tration&mdash;they are as yet better known to you than you to them. Small as the di&s;tance is that &s;eparates the two nations, in the fir&s;t boat you may ob|&s;erve upon their coa&s;t, may be &s;een the great difference between the two races of people, and that difference appears, e&s;pe|cially at fir&s;t, to be much in favour of our countrymen. The Engli&s;h &s;ailors who na|vigate our ve&s;&s;els are &s;trong, &s;ilent, labori|ous, methodical; tho&s;e on board the French ve&s;&s;els and boats are a poor, weak, and ragged race, wrangling and bu&s;tling, rather than working, with great noi&s;e but little &s;kill, the effects not corre&s;ponding to their apparent exertions. On examining the workman&s;hip and materials of every thing about them&mdash;of their ve&s;&s;els, uten&s;ils, cloth|ing&mdash;we may already draw conclu&s;ions of the inferior &s;tate of the u&s;eful arts and in|du&s;try of France. Nor do we find rea&s;on to change our opinion on going a-&s;hore&mdash; whether we in&s;pect the town or country, the &s;hops, hou&s;es, offices, the fields, fences,
<PB N="197" REF="208">
carriages, cattle, or their different trade&s;men at work, the Engli&s;h &s;uperiority is every where manife&s;t in all kinds of workman|&s;hip, and more particularly where &s;trength is required either in the work or work|men.</P>
<P>Generally bad mechanics, they can &s;el|dom make any thing &s;trong without mak|ing it clum&s;y, nor contrive any machine to an&s;wer different purpo&s;es without making it too complicated. And it &s;eems as if all the bad materials of Europe came to the French market, as iron, timber, leather, tools, and various matters for different trades and ma|nufactures. Indeed the London market, I believe, engro&s;&s;es the be&s;t of the produce in many things throughout the commercial world. You may &s;ee in our friend B.'s books the difference he makes in the price of in&s;urance between a French and an Engli&s;h &s;hip.</P>
<P>I &s;ee neither truth nor wi&s;dom in preach|ing the doctrine that one &s;ometimes hears
<PB N="198" REF="209">
maintained of late, by &s;ome young men, that their &s;eamen are every way equal to ours.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es we may &s;till think our pre|judice not ill founded, of one Engli&s;hman being equal to two Frenchmen. I already know &s;everal trades, in which the work commonly done is at lea&s;t in that propor|tion. I think they are evidently a more feeble race, and do not probably exert the &s;trength they have, equal to our workmen. But they have far more vivacity, cheerful|ne&s;s, and good humour&mdash;a re&s;tle&s;s activity, and may &s;eldomer be inclined to idlene&s;s than Engli&s;h workmen, though their la|bour is le&s;s productive. They &s;eem not &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by their work as in ha&s;te to have done. They generally employ more hands than we do to the &s;ame kind of work. You know the example of three men to fix a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, which with us is done by one.</P>
<P>With the&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;o readily &s;ug|ge&s;ted by fir&s;t appearances, and perhaps a
<PB N="199" REF="210">
little out of humour with &s;ome unexpected troubles and difficulties in getting what we want, which is not uncommon here, we may require &s;ome time to become &s;uffici|ently cool and impartial to perceive what is really good or worthy of imitation. You may not, for example, at fir&s;t attend to their excellent police&mdash;to their &s;pacious and &s;uperior manner of building, though badly fini&s;hed&mdash;to their polite and agreeable man|ner&mdash;to their ea&s;y and &s;imple ways of con|triving in &s;ome of the conveniencies and common modes of life&mdash;and to the habits of oeconomy which our children may learn. The &s;mall expence and trouble attending their dre&s;s, &s;ocieties, balls, theatres, we find very comfortable and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>I think we can already perceive that, not|with&s;tanding their poverty and weakne&s;s, they may be a happier people than we. They fortunately think they have every thing <HI>comme il faut,</HI> while we, &s;ullenly wi&s;e and profound, are di&s;contented with much of our own, and with &s;till more of theirs.
<PB N="200" REF="211">
We pretend to find among them many things dete&s;table, much below, and very little above, mediocrity, except their own conceit of them&s;elves, which, perhaps hap|pily for them, pa&s;&s;es all ordinary bounds.</P>
<P>The di&s;tingui&s;hable races of people, as if yet unmixed, to be met with in neighbour|ing countries, forms a curious &s;ubject of &s;peculation. Each name, clan, di&s;trict, or family, e&s;pecially if di&s;tant from any capital or commercial intercour&s;e, pre&s;erves a phy|&s;ical and moral character, di&s;tinct and vi|&s;ible. To inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of the&s;e characteri&s;tic di&s;tinctions might be curious, and perhaps u&s;eful. If we could with cer|tainty decide on what it may depend, differ|ent races of human beings might be bred for different purpo&s;es. Some whole races &s;eem born for the &s;word, and others for the pen, commerce, politics. If we could take as much pains with the human race as we frequently do with that of our hor&s;es, we might probably &s;ucceed as well.&mdash;We might have military colonies of mountaineers, and
<PB N="201" REF="212">
a particular breed of men for each profe&s;&s;ion of importance.</P>
<P>As to bodily &s;trength, I think the Engli&s;h make or figure is generally more favourable to it than that of the French. The greater length of back or of the body in the latter, I con&s;ider as a cau&s;e of weak|ne&s;s. I know not if our friend J. Hunter, or any anatomi&s;t, has made comparative di&s;&s;ections of different nations, or if the French have a vertebra more in the back than their neighbours. This may appear jocular, but we know the reality and the effects of this deficiency of &s;trength, in their troops, on various occa&s;ions, as during a long march or campaign. Perhaps that difference of bodily figure and proportions may be a&s;cribed to their method of &s;wath|ing their children, together with poorne&s;s of food. Not only the quantity, but like|wi&s;e the nutritive quality, of both animal and vegetable food are I believe generally inferior, in a &s;tate of poor cultivation; and it does not then produce that &s;trength and
<PB N="202" REF="213">
vigour of body or mind nece&s;&s;ary to exer|tion. Poverty, or want of capital, like|wi&s;e prevents their attempting improve|ments in agriculture. So that weakne&s;s and inability, like many other evils, tend in various ways to perpetuate them&s;elves.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Omers.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding what our very faceti|ous travellers may write, I do not find that many of us get &s;o very &s;oon into good-humour with every thing we find, good or bad, or &s;o very readily leave all our old habits and prejudices at home. We have been to Paris, Bourdeaux, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by one road, and returned hither by another. As the countries we have pa&s;&s;ed through are pretty well known, I &s;hall only trouble you with a few general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>As we advance into France, we find our|&s;elves interrupted and teazed with multi|tudes of new orders and regulations; each town, each cla&s;s, each province, and in
<PB N="204" REF="215">
&s;hort every &s;pecies of public bu&s;ine&s;s, we can pre&s;ently perceive to be overloaded with regulations, and with people to &s;ee them executed. There is not only over-regula|tion, but perpetual differences in the man|ner. Every day's journey produces &s;ome new variation. What is right here, is wrong a few leagues hence; and we may be &s;earched and &s;ubjected to fre&s;h di&s;putes and difficulties almo&s;t every day we travel. But the&s;e, and &s;uch peculiarities, you pro|bably know from other travellers, and can di&s;pen&s;e with my being more particular.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be in human nature a &s;trong propen&s;ity to legi&s;late, and to mul|tiply laws even in tho&s;e &s;ituations where none of real con&s;equence or utility can be made or executed. Does the French go|vernment mean by this fal&s;e di&s;play of in|effectual law and regularity to deceive or to torment us and their own &s;ubjects? Is it to magnify their public wi&s;dom and po|licy? It &s;trikes us that many of the&s;e very regulations tend to impede the bu&s;ine&s;s they are profe&s;&s;edly e&s;tabli&s;hed to promote.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="216">With &s;uch &s;hackles on internal commu|nication, how can they ever become a com|mercial people? and commerce appears now to be the univer&s;al object of national ambition. And how they got to their pre|&s;ent degree of indu&s;try (which is above me|diocrity), is not ea&s;ily explained. Their &s;ingular character will hardly account for it all. To be &s;ure, that happy but unfeel|ing flow of &s;pirits which makes them ea&s;y under every &s;pecies of adver&s;ity, even under &s;lavery it&s;elf, and which we are often at a lo&s;s whether to admire or de&s;pi&s;e, carries them farther on, and produces more exer|tion under the wor&s;t kind of government than any other people we know. They can exert them&s;elves after repeated di&s;ap|pointments to a very con&s;iderable degree, without any fre&s;h encouragement or &s;ecu|rity. They &s;eem ea&s;ily and willingly de|ceived by a &s;hew of law, of forms, and tribunals, into a hope of &s;ecurity; and this actually produces many of the effects of reality, whenever their government is wi&s;e enough to conceal for any time the claw of
<PB N="206" REF="217">
its power&mdash;not that I think now quite &s;o highly of their indu&s;try as I did at a di&s;|tance. In that, as in &s;everal other things, they have contrived to get a greater repu|tation than they de&s;erve. By increa&s;ing the difficulties to export their produce, and to communicate mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance between the provinces, their government has &s;et bounds to their natural activity. For tho&s;e things which cannot be carried to market will either cea&s;e to be made, or only that quan|tity will be produced which is &s;ufficient for a &s;mall con&s;umption at home, and near it.</P>
<P>This tormenting &s;eparation of provinces, and difference of laws within the &s;ame kingdom, &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed or con|tinued on purpo&s;e to divide and govern, and perhaps to impoveri&s;h, in the true &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, which is too apt to adopt &s;uch timid and in&s;idious policy.</P>
<P>The French provinces were, you know, anciently &s;o many independent &s;tates, now con&s;olidated into one great monarchy; but
<PB N="207" REF="218">
that junction &s;till remaining &s;o incomplete leaves room for the above &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t princes have now &s;ufficient power, if they were willing and active enough, to introduce an uniformity of good laws throughout their dominions; and its not being done, indicates too plainly &s;ome &s;ini&s;|ter de&s;ign or carele&s;s indifference.&mdash;Uncon|trolled power is naturally &s;ubject to both.</P>
<P>The few attempts that have been made in France towards that uniformity I believe you will find, by their hi&s;tory, have wanted both &s;incerity and per&s;everance. Nor have they ever gone far enough in the laborious work of reformation to know the difficulties of it, for the&s;e are always great and nu|merous. Rome, even in the time of Cae&s;ar, was, you know, incapable of liberty. Their ancient character, manners, and con&s;titu|tion, were together irrecoverably lo&s;t; and this I &s;u&s;pect may be the ca&s;e with France &s;ince the lo&s;s of their con&s;titution, and of all the habits and principles of their freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="219">On the proper divi&s;ion of the world into nations of a proper and govern|able &s;ize, probably depends much of the improvement of mankind. We have &s;een the too &s;mall and the too large equally incapable of duration and of advance|ment&mdash;the one unwieldy, and the other too weak. The Roman empire became too exten&s;ive, and had never probably, except at fir&s;t, a form of government well &s;uited to its extent. The numerous unequal pieces into which it was afterwards broken, were too &s;mall and un&s;ub&s;tan|tial to la&s;t long. The various attempts that have &s;ince been made to re-unite &s;ome of them, have &s;eldom as yet &s;ucceeded in re|moving the ill effects of that divi&s;ion, which may yet produce much mi&s;chief before men can di&s;cover and get into the right &s;ize, as well as the right forms, of government. As to the form, I think they might learn more from England than from all the re&s;t of the world, if nations could again get into the way of learning and borrowing laws and in&s;titutions from their neighbours, like the ancient Greeks. Where any freedom of
<PB N="209" REF="220">
enquiry exi&s;ts, they may go on by degrees to learn; and as the people open their eyes and &s;ee their chains, they may make vari|ous efforts for relief, but they are hardly any where, except <HI>chez nous,</HI> as yet &s;uf|ficiently informed to know even their ob|ject, and &s;till le&s;s the road to it.</P>
<P>The general ideas of law, ju&s;tice, go|vernment, here, after all their fine writings upon it, are yet too &s;lavi&s;h, confu&s;ed, or in|adequate; and this will probably appear in their future attempts to reform. Were they even to have their <HI>&eacute;tats generaux</HI> re|&s;tored, with their pre&s;ent inadequate ideas of repre&s;entation and elections, heated with &s;ome wild impracticable American ideas of liberty, they would probably run into &s;ome pernicious extreme, or would perpetually di&s;agree both in the &s;y&s;tem and the means. Ages of experimental enquiry, and of li|berty gradually acquired, are probably ne|ce&s;&s;ary to know the right plan, and as much more to put it in execution.</P>
<P>Modern tyranny, though more gentle, is not perhaps much le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive than the
<PB N="210" REF="221">
ancient, and probably more timid and in|dolent. Whatever may favour that indo|lence, and facilitate the ruling and draining their &s;ubjects, will be adopted by &s;uch a government, in preference to any thing that would make them rich and happy, le&s;t they &s;hould become in&s;olent when ill treated.</P>
<P>Happily for mankind, arbitrary power often defeats its own purpo&s;es; and in proportion as it deviates from hone&s;ty and &s;implicity, creates to it&s;elf trouble and di&s;|appointment. By experience it &s;ometimes di&s;covers that the&s;e animals, the people, mu&s;t at lea&s;t be fed as they work, and in proportion to the u&s;eful exertions to be ex|pected from them; and hence often ari&s;e a number of overwi&s;e regulations for that purpo&s;e; but, though better than nothing, none of the&s;e provi&s;ional regulations are equal to the &s;imple one, of letting them feed them&s;elves from their own labour. For this end, protection and &s;ecurity are &s;uffi|cient. The le&s;s government interferes in the detail of dome&s;tic oeconomy of the &s;ubject, the better.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="222">That of governing too much is perhaps one of the wor&s;t, and yet the mo&s;t common, faults of modern policy; and one of its wor&s;t effects, and which &s;eems to be the lea&s;t noticed, is, that in the progre&s;s towards &s;lavery the people gradually lo&s;e their powers and exertions, and at length be|come &s;o weak as to look up to government for almo&s;t every thing, and even perhaps at la&s;t like children to be fed.</P>
<P>Here government, or the king, is already &s;uppo&s;ed and expected to do every thing that concerns the public or any part of it. Such things as with us are done by town&s;hips or counties, by individuals or &s;ub&s;criptions, as roads, canals, &s;ea-ports, piers, &s;toring up provi&s;ions, regulating prices; even &s;tage-coaches, it &s;eems, cannot be tolerably e&s;tabli&s;hed but by his maje&s;ty becoming proprietor. In other countries trade &s;upports the &s;tate; in this the &s;tate mu&s;t &s;upport trade: every trifling thing here requires the hand of govern|ment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III.</HI> Of Agriculture.&mdash;The People.&mdash;Their De|cline, and Importance.</HEAD>
<P>EXCEPT in the wine countries, we meet with little el&s;e but corn-hu&s;|bandry; no proportional number of cattle nor a gra&s;s farm to be &s;een, though the&s;e are probably the life and &s;oul of agricul|ture. In the proper number of animals to labour, to manure, and to feed upon the land, probably con&s;i&s;ts the main &s;pring and force of agriculture, which improves with population; and thence may proceed the greate&s;t and be&s;t kind of national wealth, &s;trength, and pro&s;perity, and which by &s;uch means may yet be carried to an extent hitherto little known and le&s;s practi&s;ed, ex|cept perhaps in &s;ome parts of China, of the low countries, and near &s;ome towns.</P>
<P>The few cattle they have throughout mo&s;t parts of France are too generally but
<PB N="213" REF="224">
mi&s;erable carrion. The hor&s;es, the oxen, the &s;heep, all &s;eem of a poor degenerate race, and all of the &s;ame kind&mdash;no va|riety nor cro&s;s breeds of them, as in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Animal life in general does not appear to be in a condition of much vigour or energy throughout this kingdom, till we begin to leave it and a&s;cend the mountains by which it is bounded on either &s;ide&mdash;the Alps or Pyrenees; or till we enter the rich plains of Flanders, where we find more &s;ize and &s;trength, although becoming gro&s;s and heavy.</P>
<P>Their corn countries are mo&s;tly large, naked, melancholy plains, without trees, fences or divi&s;ions, and thinly inhabited by a poor, weak, and &s;ickly race, too often in rags and wooden &s;hoes: thus the labouring and mo&s;t u&s;eful part of the nation is con|&s;idered and treated with rigour and con|tempt. The term <HI>peuple,</HI> &s;o far from con|veying ideas of re&s;pect, greatne&s;s, benevo|lence,
<PB N="213" REF="225">
or importance, &s;eems here a term of reproach. The phra&s;e <HI>maje&s;ty of the people,</HI> borrowed from the ancients, and which you read in their authors, is neverthele&s;s unfelt and unknown, except among a few &s;ecluded philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Is it not to be apprehended that the Engli&s;h people may likewi&s;e in time lo&s;e that re&s;pect and influence which they have been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ert, though &s;ometimes with in&s;olence, unle&s;s it be more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;upported by wi&s;e regulations? On their con&s;equence being kept up, with all its in|conveniences, probably depends mo&s;t of your national &s;uperiority. That &s;uperior &s;pirit of exertion, of indu&s;try, and enter|pri&s;e, in which they go beyond any other people I know, probably proceeds from a certain noble opinion of them&s;elves, and of their own importance. Perhaps nothing but the other two branches of the legi&s;lature being obliged to court the people, could &s;o long have pre&s;erved their importance in the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="226">But are there not certain degrees of cor|ruption and debility, a gradual change of manners, and hence of government, which nece&s;&s;arily attend a high &s;tate of civiliza|tion, and which may &s;ink them to a level with their neighbours, unle&s;s &s;ome means can be found to counteract them? Different degrees of arts and civilization may require different laws and regulations. The &s;pirit of liberty mu&s;t be proportionate to times and circum&s;tances. The &s;ame &s;pecies of freedom and licentiou&s;ne&s;s that might have been formerly nece&s;&s;ary, and the few regu|lations and re&s;traints that were found to be &s;ufficient, may not be &s;o now. And un|le&s;s you arrange and regulate the people better, for both civil and military purpo&s;es, and thereby &s;ecure their importance in the &s;tate with proper &s;ubordination, they may, through anarchy, fall into the &s;ame kind of languid impotence and contempt with mo&s;t of the people throughout the re&s;t of the world; and the weight, the &s;uperiority of your nation will fall with them.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="227">The mi&s;chievous anarchy of the demo|cratic &s;pirit might certainly be obviated by wi&s;e regulations, and without lo&s;ing its be|neficial effects.</P>
<P>One would &s;ometimes be tempted to believe even our government capable, at times, of a certain &s;ini&s;ter policy, of leav|ing the people in a &s;tate of confu&s;ion, that they may, by their exce&s;&s;es, bring them&s;elves and their cau&s;e into di&s;grace; and that our different parties too often tacitly agree in that neglect, or &s;ecretly im|pede the nece&s;&s;ary remedies.

However, you &s;tand a noble in|&s;tance to &s;hew, with how little force and coercion a people may be governed. Yet your wi&s;e&s;t &s;overeigns have probably made the mo&s;t arrangements, and had always tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential points of <HI>defence</HI> and <HI>police</HI> at once in view; but they did not, as here, &s;o heavily over-burden the people with &s;uperfluous and oppre&s;&s;ive regulations.

<P>THE circum&s;tances of the times, and of this journey in particular, mu&s;t, I &s;ee, inevitably give a political turn to this corre&s;pondence; and as I cannot have much new information to give you con|cerning this country, I may therefore in|dulge in a variety of &s;peculations as things occur to call them forth. The poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion of the lower cla&s;&s;es, the injuri|ous divi&s;ion of property, in this and many other countries, produce a variety of re|flections on the fate of man, on the ma|nagement of &s;ociety, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h to believe our government im|proving, but am often in doubt.

<P>But to proceed with our French journey.

We owe a particular attention to that country from whence we had, probably, both the loom and the plough, with other u&s;eful arts, and where agriculture is &s;till kept up to perhaps a more u&s;eful degree of perfec|tion than even in England it&s;elf: they may not have &s;o great a proportion of fine parks, fine hor&s;es, and variety of cattle as we have, but they have enough, and only for utility; and throughout whole provinces, have neither fallow, common, nor wa&s;te land.</P>

means and the materials of riches and in|du&s;try, woods, coals, mines, people: the trade and navigation of both might be doubled and trebled, but for the &s;elfi&s;h tyranny of the different &s;tates through which they pa&s;s. If the &s;eventeen provinces, ac|cording to the fir&s;t idea of their revolt from Spain, could be reunited under one good government, it would be a noble country, and a re&s;pectable power. Charlemagne cho&s;e his capital between the Mai&s;e and Rhine. But on approaching France, the baneful influence of that government, the effects of French laws, and French lea&s;es, &s;oon begin to appear. Even in French Flanders, though the &s;ame kind of &s;oil with the Au&s;trian, wa&s;te and fallow lands, weeds and negligence, begin to be &s;een; and as we advance into France, many other &s;ad changes for the wor&s;e we are doomed to experience. We gradually lo&s;e the noble &s;pacious farm hou&s;es, with great barns like churches, in exchange for wretched half-ruined hovels; we leave the comfortable neat Flemi&s;h dre&s;&s;es, for French rags, dirty woollen night-caps, wooden &s;hoes, and

This incon&s;i&s;tent prejudice in France, where the women have &s;o much influence, of employing men in&s;tead of women &s;ervants in almo&s;t every depart|ment, is not ea&s;ily accounted for, and to me is truly di&s;gu&s;ting.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. A. J.</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Paris,
<DATE>1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FEAR you begin to expect too much from me, and depend too little on what you have read and heard. I doubt there may be but little in France that is new to you, and that can be communicated in this way, nor any very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to be learned, until we di&s;cover &s;ome new de|fects, &s;omething to find fault with by way of text: for from faults and defects, I be|lieve, we are more willing to learn, than from precept or imitation. There is often &s;omething very amu&s;ing, and not ungrate|ful to the mind of man or woman, to hear a country well abu&s;ed, or &s;ee their foibles
<PB N="231" REF="242">
turned into ridicule. Among the various travellers one meets with, I think the &s;ulky and &s;atirical are not among the lea&s;t en|tertaining or u&s;eful; and I believe, that as much is to be learned from the blunt or bitter humour of &s;ome old Engli&s;h travel|lers, as from that eternal affectation of plea&s;antry or complai&s;ance which is now &s;o much in fa&s;hion, and which is proba|bly as prolific a &s;ource of mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion, as any other humour or prejudice whatever. The conceived nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeming always plea&s;ed with every thing, however di&s;agreeable or even dete&s;table, mu&s;t mi&s;lead and bias our minds and our pens, as much as the other extreme, the ill humour of tho&s;e <HI>Anglois atrabilaires</HI> whom we have &s;een pe&s;ting and &s;wearing at all they met with out of their own country. I &s;hould think a little old fa&s;hion|ed Engli&s;h &s;incerity and good &s;en&s;e to the full as becoming in our travellers, as tho&s;e con&s;tant attempts at trifling wit and plea|&s;antry, or that perpetual grin of <HI>polite&s;&s;e,</HI> which we are now &s;o ready to borrow,
<PB N="232" REF="243">
and awkwardly imitate, from the&s;e our agreeable neighbours.</P>
<P>I believe you remember the gentleman who returned to England immediately on &s;eeing a French kitchen; and my fellow-traveller, who had determined to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days on the continent, on find|ing at Calais that he could not have beef|&s;takes well dre&s;&s;ed, &s;et off next day on his return;&mdash;and our friend S&mdash;, who left Spain directly when he found he could not have melted butter to his veal, which had co&s;t him &s;o much pains and money to procure.</P>
<P>Within tho&s;e extremes of natural blunt|ne&s;s and acquired affectation, there are travellers of great variety of &s;pecies and character; and to each of the&s;e, objects will appear very different. The accounts hone&s;tly enough given by one, may to another appear fallacious; &s;o that we may all write on, and &s;till find &s;ubjects enough to employ our pens, as well from the va|riety
<PB N="233" REF="244">
of unexamined matter, as from the different &s;ight, character, or views of the travellers.</P>
<P>But to return.&mdash;I believe I meant to &s;ay &s;omething about &s;ome of their towns; but do not be alarmed, for I mean not to trouble you with de&s;criptions, becau&s;e I think they never convey the ideas that are de&s;igned.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, generally,&mdash;From a kind of childi&s;h di&s;like of being alone, which they call love of &s;ociety, the French live much in towns, &s;o as to play at cards, and have little ta&s;te for a country life, notwith&s;tanding what they may tell you to the contrary in their books. As &s;till a wor&s;e &s;ymptom of their ta&s;te, the people of be&s;t fortune get to live generally in the central and mo&s;t un|whole&s;ome parts of a town, leaving the out-&s;kirts and fine &s;ituations to poverty and na&s;tine&s;s. For the whole &s;eems divided only into two cla&s;&s;es, the extremes of &s;ociety, or the few rich, and the many very poor, with too few of tho&s;e middle ranks
<PB N="234" REF="245">
which form the be&s;t bonds of &s;ociety, and the &s;trength of the nation. Mo&s;t of this you may already know;&mdash;only let me de&s;ire you will trace the cau&s;es and nume|rous con&s;equences of this injurious divi&s;ion of rank and property, when you vi&s;it the&s;e countries, for it is of great con&s;equence to &s;ociety; the remedy is difficult, and re|quires more wi&s;dom than can even be ex|pected in an arbitrary government. In this you may trace, perhaps, the inevitable decline of Europe. Such objects are worthy of you as a philo&s;opher, a &s;oldier, and probably a future &s;enator.</P>
<P>I need not trouble you much about this fine city, <HI>Paris;</HI> though &s;uperior to Lon|don in &s;ome very material things, yet I think it inferior in many others. Though &s;uperior in public walks, libraries, palaces; London has certainly the advantage in the other e&s;&s;entials and comforts of life. I like their boulevards prodigiou&s;ly,&mdash;a very exten&s;ive open walk, without going out of town, with &s;uch variety of buildings and amu&s;ements; it in&s;pires one with &s;ome
<PB N="235" REF="246">
ideas of liberty, till by approaching the Ba&s;tile at the end of it, we are put in mind where we are. But the &s;treets of this town are &s;hocking. You mu&s;t either ride over people, or be ridden over.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay I like the generality of the&s;e Pari&s;ians, nor can think them near &s;o ami|able as they do them&s;elves. Mo&s;t of them who have not travelled, I fancy, you would think intolerably conceited and ignorant,&mdash; at once polite and impertinent. Compli|ments do not con&s;titute civility. Their atttention, &s;o far from civility, is often rudene&s;s. We can too often di&s;cover that they meant no kindne&s;s to us by their com|pliments, as we might at fir&s;t imagine, but only to &s;hew them&s;elves off as &s;uperior to us. I do not mean by <HI>Pari&s;ian,</HI> any of their people of the <HI>fir&s;t fa&s;hion,</HI> for they are, in general, perfectly polite, ea&s;y, and genteel, and perhaps more amiably &s;o than our own.</P>
<P>You know there are many of the learned and wi&s;e here, as well as of the agreeable;
<PB N="236" REF="247">
but the former are not yet &s;o often to be found among the latter, as you may fancy, from knowing, it is become the fa&s;hion for authors and men of learning to be admitted into the fir&s;t company more than formerly. However, we are plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;ome of the learned and philo&s;ophic of both &s;exes taking the lead, even among people of the fir&s;t rank and fortune; and if they go on, we may &s;ee Plato's wi&s;h accompli&s;hed, and the world governed by philo&s;ophers. But hitherto I doubt if authors be always the mo&s;t im|proving or de&s;irable company. Some, en|gro&s;&s;ed and led away by books, are thereby le&s;s acquainted with, and le&s;s &s;it for, the world. Others, ab&s;ent, re&s;erved, and au&s;tere, already embarra&s;&s;ed with a reputa|tion which is to be &s;upported with great caution and artifice; embroiled in the vanity and intrigues of the world, their works and opinions already known, and operating like religious prejudices which can &s;eldom be touched, or mu&s;t be &s;up|ported right or wrong; their conver&s;ation is not always &s;o frank and intelligent, nor
<PB N="237" REF="248">
&s;o edifying as might be expected from their knowledge.</P>
<P>The young, if &s;tudious and unprejudiced, full of information and curio&s;ity, as yet eager after truth, and only in the progre&s;s towards reputation and author-craft, are probably the be&s;t worth knowing,&mdash;the mo&s;t friendly and communicative, parti|cularly with &s;trangers; but &s;uch men are not ea&s;ily to be met with, as they do not wa&s;te much of their time with the cards and non&s;en&s;e of common &s;ocieties.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VI.</HI> French Character, and national Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>TO draw the French character with the ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion I could wi&s;h, would require more penetration and labour than I can claim, or have lei&s;ure to be&s;tow. I mean to give you only a few of the &s;trik|ing features as I pa&s;s, and to deal more in blemi&s;hes than in beauties.</P>
<P>When we travellers can be hone&s;t enough to give you things as they &s;trike us at &s;ight, I fear that the faults will always &s;tand fir&s;t. The foibles and defects of this people mu&s;t make the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. I believe there is no great danger of the two nations &s;oon becoming very fond of each other. The one values it&s;elf on the kinds of merit which are neither e&s;teemed nor wanted by the other. The French mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;olid &s;en&s;e, and inde|pendent
<PB N="239" REF="250">
&s;pirit, perhaps as much as we do their <HI>e&s;prit, graces, agrements.</HI> They mu&s;t di&s;like our &s;ullen, proud, awkward man|ner, as much as we do their conceit, vanity,&mdash;<HI>leur manieres avantageu&s;es, l'envie de &s;e faire valoir, leur fatuit&eacute;,</HI> &amp;c. It re|quires &s;ome time to di&s;cover, through their politene&s;s, how much they di&s;like us.</P>
<P>Yet, if it were not for a war now and then, I &s;hould fear our a&s;&s;imilating too much towards the&s;e our agreeable neigh|bours, and our meeting them more than half-way. Though few of them will pro|bably ever have good &s;en&s;e enough to be much plea&s;ed with ours; many of us are apt to have good nature enough to like both their manner and their manners, <HI>leur franchi&s;e, leur babil,</HI> and many other le&s;s important agreeable nothings about them.</P>
<P>They may hate us, while we de&s;pi&s;e them, and contempt may be full as power|ful in its effects as hatred. Yet I believe, we &s;hall generally find many more Engli&s;h in France, than French in England. Per|haps
<PB N="240" REF="251">
&s;ome of us come here in order to get rid of our ill-humour, or to vent it on them, like tho&s;e who keep an humble dependant to &s;cold at. Although we may recipro|cally improve by intercour&s;e, and it might be better for mankind were nations to mix more with each other, yet one would wi&s;h each to retain their native character,&mdash;that national &s;tamp which di&s;criminates it from the re&s;t. In order to this, it may be well to dwell on the faults we would wi&s;h to avoid. I &s;hall therefore go on, as at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, picking up a few of them <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI></P>
<P>Though the national or prevailing cha|racter here, like that of other human beings, is mixed, and made up of good, bad, and indifferent qualities; yet &s;uch parts predominate, as make the compo&s;ition of a Frenchman very di&s;tingui&s;hable, and dif|ferent from any other:&mdash;but to know him, you mu&s;t live with him; reading about him is in&s;ufficient. You will find, for ex|ample, <HI>qu'il ne &s;e &s;uffit pas &agrave; lui m&ecirc;me,</HI> but lives by the breath and opinion of others more than on his own.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="252">He will &s;acrifice every other comfort of life to the ornament of his per&s;on. The lodging of a very fine <HI>petit maitre</HI> here, is often too mean and dirty for a taylor's journeyman with you.</P>
<P>In them, all is borrowed, <HI>po&s;tiche,</HI> and very little natural; <HI>ils veulent toujours re|pre&s;enter</HI>&mdash;their life is a mere parade. Yet they only copy from each other <HI>(tres mou|toniers),</HI> while we are always flying off into &s;ingularity, hunting after nature or reality, but perhaps with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s in our attempts than they in theirs.</P>
<P>They &s;eem ever changing, but are &s;till the &s;ame. It is only we that really change, with all our apparent &s;teadine&s;s and gra|vity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frenchman,</HI> though &s;ociably di&s;|po&s;ed, with all that enviable <HI>gaiet&eacute; de coeur,</HI> and affected goodne&s;s and con&s;ideration for others; yet as he is not in the habit of doing any thing e&s;&s;ential for the public, and but little for his neighbour, and it is, perhaps, the lot of that kind of vivacity and flow of
<PB N="242" REF="253">
&s;pirits, to be capable of but little feeling or humanity; he is probably, on the whole, therefore a more &s;elfi&s;h being than the <HI>&s;ulky Engli&s;hman.</HI> I think I &s;ee here, in&s;tances of the &s;elfi&s;h prevailing over the friendly qualities, rather more than with us;&mdash;the oeconomical, or par&s;imonious, over the generous,&mdash;the cruel and unfeeling over the humane,&mdash;<HI>l'etourderie</HI> over &s;entiment, &mdash;a fal&s;e ta&s;te, or <HI>gout po&s;tiche,</HI> over that of nature. Be&s;ides particular in&s;tances, one &s;ees it in generals,&mdash;as in the &s;everity, and negligent compo&s;ition of &s;ome laws, and in the mode of execution:&mdash;in the general preference given to liferents over any fixed future provi&s;ion for po&s;terity, or relations. Perhaps we might infer &s;ome want of feeling or humanity, from their want of ta&s;te for the &s;imple beauty of na|ture and of action; and we may per|ceive, in the different degrees of art, pa&s;|&s;ion, or mu&s;ic, that they feel nothing, till the expre&s;&s;ion is carried to an outrageous and vulgar extreme, certainly beyond our line of beauty. But they like it, and that is a &s;hort and &s;ufficient an&s;wer to all our
<PB N="243" REF="254">
objections. It is needle&s;s to di&s;pute about ta&s;te. While they can reli&s;h only tho&s;e degrees of violence and expre&s;&s;ion, they may laugh at our critici&s;ms.</P>
<P>The degree of expre&s;&s;ion in all the arts mu&s;t be tempered to the tone of mind of the &s;pectators, more than to the true nature of the pa&s;&s;ion to be expre&s;&s;ed. In a &s;tate of ea&s;e and tranquillity, a refined audience will not readily admit of the violence of real pa&s;&s;ion, nor of any of its di&s;tortions, beyond a certain limit of the graceful and temperate. This limit may be extend|ed, but &s;hould never be broken, by pre|viou&s;ly warming up the mind by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive or accumulating impre&s;&s;ions. The French will never probably under&s;tand the natural repo&s;e of true and graceful dignity.</P>
<P>Without the con&s;tant force of &s;ome foreign aid and intercour&s;e, national cha|racter and ta&s;te mu&s;t perhaps generally re|vert into &s;ome confined tract or circle. And when national pride, conceit, and
<PB N="244" REF="255">
ignorance are planted, they readily &s;pread, and tend, like other evils, to perpetuate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Though many of the French are now liberal, and willing enough to get rid of the &s;hackles of nationality in ta&s;te and cha|racter; yet, after a certain age, it is per|haps more impracticable with them, than with tho&s;e of any other nation, to &s;ucceed. Some of them &s;atiri&s;e and abu&s;e their own nation, and prai&s;e others;&mdash;affect to extol the Italian &s;chool in painting and mu&s;ic;&mdash; imitate Engli&s;h manners; and all the while remain mere Frenchmen. In order to change or improve their ta&s;te, they would have to combat many inveterate habits, of which they are not aware; and the cau&s;es of their peculiarities they them&s;elves are unfit to inve&s;tigate. In &s;hort, they appear to us a different &s;pecies, <HI>une race apart;</HI> this they forget, or never perceive.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VII.</HI> Fine Arts.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;een their biennial exhibition of paintings, and wi&s;hed to be more of a connoi&s;&s;eur on your account. With my &s;mall degree of &s;kill or ta&s;te, I am inclined to believe they have hardly a painter, at pre&s;ent, above a &s;econd or third rate, ex|cept <HI>one.</HI> However, I think I have &s;een &s;ome young &s;tudents who promi&s;e well, and may contribute to revive true ta&s;te, and the great &s;tyle, provided they travel in time: this is indi&s;pen&s;able. Their pre&s;ent mode inclines too much towards tho&s;e <HI>fa|dai&s;es</HI> of <HI>Dreu&s;e,</HI> which, though often pretty and nicely executed, are &s;o far beneath that fir&s;t and grand &s;tyle of painting which tends at once to forward that delightful art, and to elevate and improve the mind, that we are at a lo&s;s where to rank the&s;e things, &mdash;the&s;e pieces from common life!&mdash;and
<PB N="248" REF="259">
French life too! they may have &s;ome merit in their way, though not equal to that of Hogarth's pieces of the &s;ame kind, nor of equal &s;pirit or moral ten|dency.</P>
<P>Let us by all means imitate nature;&mdash; but there is &s;urely a choice or &s;election of objects, by which the true judgment of genius is di&s;tingui&s;hed, and we mu&s;t rank the elegant and &s;ublime above the mean and affected. There is an univer&s;al beauty and elegance, which is not of any particular country, but to be culled from all nature, or conceived by a warm and elegant fancy, within the power of nature, but beyond what &s;he has been known to produce: &s;he furni&s;hes hints as points upon which genius builds, and almo&s;t creates.</P>
<P>Their &s;culptors have &s;ucceeded, I think, better than their painters, and have fre|quently come nearer to their ma&s;ters the Italians and Greeks than any of us. But a little French affectation often intrudes even into &s;ome of their fir&s;t rate compo&s;i|tions,
<PB N="249" REF="260">
and which, to me, always &s;poils the effects of the whole piece.</P>
<P>I believe their modern art of <HI>dancing,</HI> and their <HI>theatres,</HI> have helped to vitiate more than to improve their ta&s;te in the fine arts. I often fancy that I &s;ee, in many of their be&s;t performances, &s;ome of their dancing or theatrical ideas of grace, which, to me, is generally mere affectation, di&s;tortion, or grimace. This is copying from a copy, and a bad copy, in&s;tead of going to the original.</P>
<P>From this general cen&s;ure on their arti&s;ts, you know I except one, viz. <HI>Vernet,</HI> who follows nature, and chu&s;es well, and is, I think, cla&s;&s;ically elegant in &s;ome things;&mdash; but he &s;tudied in Italy, I am told, from a child. Their merit, as already hinted, in the arts, has generally been nearly in pro|portion to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Italy. The cau&s;es, or at lea&s;t the means of their great progre&s;s, during the time of Lewis XIV. aro&s;e chiefly from thence. They were then liberal enough to &s;hew to whom they owed
<PB N="250" REF="261">
their excellence,&mdash;to imitate the Italian &s;chool, and encourage their arti&s;ts. Since that period I do not find they have im|proved, but on the contrary declined, as they returned to their national conceit and contempt of &s;trangers, fancying them&s;elves &s;uperior to the Italians, and to all the world, in every thing. There is &s;carce an Italian arti&s;t now to be found in all France, while they are giving immen&s;e prices for little Dutch and Flemi&s;h pictures;&mdash;both bad &s;ymptoms. I believe there has hardly ever been a great arti&s;t among tho&s;e who never &s;aw the Mediterranean, nor Italy. An ac|quaintance with the nations that &s;urround that &s;ea, I con&s;ider as a nece&s;&s;ary part of education, and e&s;pecially for arti&s;ts. I am inclined to believe that none of us can well arrive at the fir&s;t degrees of excellence in any thing, without leaving our own coun|try early, and frequently taking enlarged views of men, of nature, and of art. I doubt if the French have any other way left to be great in any thing, but by leaving their country very young, and &s;taying away till they almo&s;t forget they are French, and
<PB N="251" REF="262">
till they acquire other habits and ideas, and exerci&s;e their faculties and their organs on other objects, and in a different manner from what can be done in their own coun|try. This, as it may appear &s;ingular, I mu&s;t endeavour to explain &s;ome other time.</P>
<P>You know the French have an academy at Rome, but their natural conceit has likewi&s;e rendered it almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to them; for the regulations require the &s;tudents fir&s;t to have gained prizes at home, and be completely fixed in their national manner, before they go there: whenever they get there, their chief object is gained; they &s;eem to &s;it down almo&s;t &s;atisfied with that trifling di&s;tinction, and are not often much inclined to labour afterwards for more fame.</P>
<P>All this, you will readily conceive, is &s;peaking rather in a general and indi&s;cri|minate manner, for which you will make &s;ome allowance, and recollect, that the exact truth cannot always be expre&s;&s;ed, and much
<PB N="252" REF="263">
le&s;s in few words. They have now &s;ome promi&s;ing young arti&s;ts, who are aware of the&s;e national defects and impediments; and others will probably ari&s;e and execute finer ideas, and in a better manner than have lately appeared here; and will revive that proper re&s;pect for Italy, and the re|mains of the ancients, which is always the concomitant of real merit. They may emulate, without being confined to their own great ma&s;ters, for you know they have had very great ones. You will begin to think that I am likewi&s;e becoming a con|noi&s;&s;eur, like mo&s;t of our travelling coun|trymen, who &s;eem &s;o generally to be en|gro&s;&s;ed and infatuated by the pur&s;uits of <HI>virt&ugrave;.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall, however, pur&s;ue my re|flections.</P>
<P>The fine arts are, doubtle&s;s, entitled to our admiration and e&s;teem, and con&s;idered, even ab&s;tractedly from the plea&s;ure they af|ford, may tend more to the benefit than the prejudice of mankind. But their good ef|fects will depend much on the objects about which they are employed. In this, &s;ome
<PB N="253" REF="264">
of the ancients were wi&s;er, or more for|tunate, than we, in employing the painter and &s;culptor to promote public virtue by the public commemoration of great men, and great actions. And I &s;hould have more re&s;pect for tho&s;e arts now, if they could be made to unite in producing &s;ome more public good, of which I can &s;till &s;ee the po&s;&s;ibility. But while we &s;ee them confined to a few great towns, and there, among a few great families and churches, the only &s;eats of elegance and luxury, while mi&s;ery reigns throughout the re&s;t of the nation, the&s;e fine arts become no very favourable &s;ymptoms of the advancement of human happine&s;s, or of the &s;cience of government.</P>
<P>Religion has latterly been the chief ob|ject in which the arts have been made to join their aid with tho&s;e great effects, which I could wi&s;h to extend to more general utility. But in this progre&s;s, I fear we have lately lo&s;t, in&s;tead of gaining ground. I cannot but lament that our religious re|formers &s;hould have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="254" REF="265">
di&s;mi&s;s, at once, from our churches, paint|ing, &s;culpture, and mu&s;ic. May not we hope that &s;ome of our princes or bi&s;hops will be able to recal them to their &s;tation by degrees, as u&s;eful knowledge and ele|gant ta&s;te extend their influence? We ought not to de&s;pair of &s;uch a revolution, when we know that even &s;ome of the Ma|homedan princes contrived to admit the arts, in &s;pite of their religion, though it &s;eems to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed on purpo&s;e to ex|clude them, to promote ignorance, and de&s;troy the mental powers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Commerce.&mdash;Manufactures.&mdash;Reflections.</HEAD>
<P>THE French, with all their indu&s;try, are not yet a commercial nation, though their government appears at times to be &s;mitten with &s;ome temporary fits of &s;upporting trade (perhaps becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion), and have even taken part in the modern ab&s;urdity of <HI>commercial wars.</HI> They would not have much occa&s;ion to depend on the precarious re&s;ources of foreign com|merce, if they could make a proper u&s;e of the advantages of their &s;ituation&mdash;of the fertility and extent of their country. But <HI>that</HI> again would require a degree of liberty and &s;ecurity, and a kind of government of which they are perhaps now incapable.</P>
<P>Even if commerce &s;hould appear to be|come more nece&s;&s;ary to them, in order to contend with other maritime powers, if they
<PB N="256" REF="267">
are wi&s;e, they will con&s;ider well before they attempt to &s;acrifice their military to their commercial character. While the romantic &s;entiments of honour can produce certain effects and exertions, it would be unwi&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute the love of wealth, which might not operate in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering, however, the difficulties there mu&s;t be, under &s;uch a government, to attract or rai&s;e great capitals, and to employ them in any &s;cheme of commerce or manu|facture, they have &s;ucceeded amazingly in &s;ome things of the kind. You know their &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ilks, and in &s;ome &s;orts of wool|lens, which might &s;ucceed &s;till better if le&s;s burdened with regulations. Their <HI>goblins</HI> is an elegant manufactory. <HI>That</HI> company has a monopoly for dying certain colours. This we &s;hould perhaps think oppre&s;&s;ive but here it may have good effects. Like the royal manufactories in &s;ome other poor nations, it may be the only means o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> retaining them in the country, and of &s;up|porting the quality and reputation of the goods; operating &s;omewhat in the way tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="257" REF="268">
our &s;tatutes of apprentice&s;hip have been &s;uppo&s;ed to do: and I &s;u&s;pect there may be truth in that &s;uppo&s;ition, and wi&s;dom in the in&s;titution; for, in countries where ap|prentice&s;hips are not rendered nece&s;&s;ary by law, I think the workman&s;hip of every thing is inferior. I wi&s;h you could per|&s;uade &s;ome of your dyers, and others who work in metals, &amp;c. to &s;tudy che|mi&s;try, and could give a better education to your trade&s;men, and to the lower people in general.</P>
<P>The manufactory of looking-gla&s;s like|wi&s;e, &s;o well known here, is a noble and profitable work, and well conducted. Eight hundred people are employed in one build|ing. You may attempt it in England, but cannot, I fear, &s;ucceed near &s;o well as here; for there will not be near the &s;ame demand. The &s;uperior luxury and riches of this great country,&mdash;the fa&s;hion and ta&s;te of the peo|ple for that ornament,&mdash;their having the &s;tart in the methods of working, and in the markets of Europe, are cau&s;es quite &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="258" REF="269">
for holding their great &s;uperiority over all competitors in this branch.</P>
<P>The porcelaine fabrics, which many princes &s;eem of late &s;o fond of promoting, can be of little &s;ervice, I doubt, to a na|tion,&mdash;only &s;o far as they may be the means of improving the public ta&s;te, and tho&s;e we call <HI>earthen ware,</HI> which, being of common u&s;e, are of far more import|ance. Though, in the&s;e la&s;t, they are trying &s;ome of our late improvements at <HI>Rouen,</HI> as well as &s;ome of the cotton vel|vets, I have no dread of their being able to rival our friends Bentley and Wedge|wood, nor the arts and methods &s;o far be|fore them, and long e&s;tabli&s;hed, at Man|che&s;ter, and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>When will nations be cured of the folly of attempting to &s;upply them&s;elves with every thing by their own hands? How much better to take of each other whatever is the mo&s;t natural and convenient produce of each? This may open a fertile &s;ource of
<PB N="259" REF="270">
intercour&s;e, and of future benefits to man|kind.</P>
<P>Though this is now become a very liberal nation, or rather produces many liberal individuals, their reputation in this too is beyond the reality, as in many other things. The reputation is acquired by means of many little arts, and of their pretty little language.</P>
<P>Though doubtful if their government will ever be liberal enough to open their ports with us on a fair and equitable foot|ing;&mdash;though their politics have generally been too artful and cunning, and con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly in little tricks, and in outwitting even their friends&mdash;a great fault, and too much imitated;&mdash;yet let us hope, that &s;ome liberal prince, or mini&s;ter, may dare to lead them right.</P>
<P>It is more from ill-humour than want of knowledge, that nations do not yet lay their commerce more open to each other. Let us hope that &s;ome of them will &s;oon
<PB N="260" REF="271">
break the ice, and others may follow. As our friend Adam Smith's book comes to be more generally read and known, I think his principles mu&s;t prevail, and contribute greatly to open the eyes of nations to &s;ee their own intere&s;t; and it may, in that ca&s;e, be of more &s;ervice to the world than any book that has appeared &s;ince Euclid.</P>
<P>The French would willingly per&s;uade them&s;elves, and the world, that their coun|try is improving very fa&s;t: but of that, I doubt even the po&s;&s;ibility under &s;uch a government. Their having advanced &s;o far, under &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ion, is really wonderful; but I &s;u&s;pect they cannot go much farther. The fine arts&mdash;the trifling arts, may yet advance a little; but I doubt the country, and the people, mu&s;t long remain nearly as they are, or go back|wards.</P>
<P>A few philo&s;ophers in the capital may write very good books, and may fancy they are improving their nation, and the world, at a great rate, and all the while
<PB N="261" REF="272">
their names are &s;carcely known in the pro|vinces, where it requires far other efforts to bani&s;h oppre&s;&s;ion, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic, again&s;t the intere&s;t of the more powerful &s;upporters of e&s;tabli&s;hed abu&s;es.</P>
<P>Book-making is a very con&s;iderable trade in this country; and they are thereby bet|ter known, and rather over-rated, in other countries. Europe pays them, in this way, a con&s;iderable and voluntary tax for the plea&s;ure and convenience of their agreeable, and now almo&s;t univer&s;al language.</P>
<P>Thus, I am at length gradually brought back to the &s;ubject of your la&s;t,&mdash;to the province of fancy, ta&s;te, and literature; where, I grant you, &s;omething mu&s;t be frequently picked, to mix up with the dry materials of mere utility, and to &s;ea&s;on, where po&s;&s;ible, the bitter or in&s;ipid draughts of common or laborious life.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER IX.</HI> Arti&s;ts.&mdash;Nationalites.&mdash;Theatres.&mdash;Reflec|tions.&mdash;Language.</HEAD>
<P>IT may pre&s;ently be &s;een that the arts have been encouraged here more than with us, and with more &s;ucce&s;s at one period; though I think they have at others gone farther wrong than our&s;elves. Al|though they have had very great ma&s;ters, and the names of Pou&s;&s;in, Le Brun, Le Sueur, Girardon, &amp;c. will always &s;tand high in the li&s;ts of fame, yet the national ta&s;te has been but little improved by them; and the general &s;tyle of drawing, of orna|ment, of architecture, is &s;till almo&s;t as vi|ciou&s;ly national and capricious as before the time of tho&s;e great men. They have more great works to &s;hew than we have; but, at the &s;ame time, more bad ta&s;te. The moderns in general have been &s;inking, and are now far beneath the &s;chools of
<PB N="263" REF="274">
tho&s;e great ma&s;ters: but I think the French have &s;unk lower than any of us, and more than was to be expected in &s;o great and poli&s;hed a nation.</P>
<P>There is now however &s;ome hope, I think, of the revival of true ta&s;te and ge|nius in the competition of tho&s;e two great nations, France and England: but we mu&s;t all have recour&s;e to Italy for that purpo&s;e; and mu&s;t there labour yet long, before it can be accompli&s;hed. In <HI>that</HI> progre&s;s, we &s;hall probably approach nearer to each other, and may agree better in ta&s;te and opinions; though, in many things, each will mo&s;t likely always retain its peculiarities.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome early habits more ob&s;ti|nately retained than others. Our ta&s;te, for example, in cookery, in amu&s;ements, in dre&s;s, and ornaments, I think we &s;eldom change; and we are more firmly attached to particular di&s;hes, plays, actors, and &s;ing|ers, than to many things of greater im|portance. Though men and nations &s;eem born to differ wherever it is po&s;&s;ible, yet
<PB N="264" REF="275">
where the general principles are obvious, we mu&s;t often be of the &s;ame opinion. We may agree with the&s;e people about a problem or a picture, but we &s;hall perhaps always prefer roa&s;t beef and Shake&s;pear to &s;oupe and Racine; while they, as con&s;tant|ly, remain in the oppo&s;ite ta&s;te, and prefer the latter.</P>
<P>Their mu&s;ic, and &s;ome of their theatri|cal amu&s;ements, are certainly full of bad ta&s;te, as well as with us, though we differ widely. Truth is but one&mdash;errors are in|finite. In order to get into the right road that leads to improvement, to truth, beau|ty, and nature, we mu&s;t fir&s;t be forced from our national prejudices, by early and frequent travel, and mu&s;t become inti|mately conver&s;ant with the arts, ta&s;te, and people, of other countries. Even then, our labour is only begun; much will af|terwards depend on the wi&s;dom and en|couragement, and on particular in&s;titutions, at home,&mdash;on education&mdash;on fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="276">You know the French have &s;ome good comedies; and their &s;pirited and agreeable manner is well &s;uited to comic action. In|deed I con&s;ider them as the fir&s;t comedians in the world: but their tragic action and declamation, of which they are &s;o fond, I think wretched; con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of a kind of furious or outrageous bomba&s;t, which I believe &s;eldom fails to di&s;gu&s;t &s;trangers at fir&s;t. The Frenchified Greek and Roman characters, which they &s;hew on their &s;tage, are like nothing in nature; but appear to us a ridiculous &s;ort of <HI>cari|caturas,</HI> blown up by a puerile or petulant kind of pa&s;&s;ion, unworthy even of the chil|dren of tho&s;e manly people. Though the French &s;eem to like all &s;orts of violence in action, declamation, &amp;c. and prefer their wretched tragedies to their excellent comedies; yet I do not think they feel much with the actors, nor can be con&s;i|dered as fond of tragedy. They are al|ways di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ed, and &s;eem to di&s;tribute their applau&s;e in proportion to the exertions of the actors, though ever &s;o extravagant: the&s;e are generally in ex|tremes,
<PB N="266" REF="277">
which are u&s;ually di&s;torted and ug|ly; they are always ready to bur&s;t on every trifling occa&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion: &s;o that they, as it were, at once over&s;hoot the mark, and leave behind all tho&s;e natural gradations or tran&s;itions in the pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind. In &s;hort, their players, <HI>toujours prets a cr&eacute;v&eacute;r,</HI> &s;eem to have very &s;eldom any idea of a truly great and dignified cha|racter; and but few of their poets have arrived to the &s;ublime or natural, on any &s;ubject, and &s;till le&s;s in the operations of the human pa&s;&s;ions. The great charac|ters which they have attempted to deli|neate, from whatever country they are an|nounced, generally turn out to be mere Frenchmen.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of tho&s;e things, and of their appearance to us, may be various and com|plicated: yet I cannot help attributing much of it to their language. Wherever the great pa&s;&s;ions are concerned, the &s;trange magic of this language with me is &s;uch, as to turn the hero who u&s;es it, into a <HI>fanfa|ron,</HI> and the fine&s;t air, in &s;inging; into a
<PB N="267" REF="278">
vulgar howl. But the mo&s;t powerful, though di&s;tant, &s;ource of all their <HI>&eacute;garemens</HI> in the&s;e various walks of fancy and genius, is probably a fal&s;e or defective ta&s;te for the beauties of nature, and their want of inclination for a country life: this again may proceed from their government, man|ners, and ways of living. Things are wonderfully connected in this world. Per|haps till we &s;ee their farms and country-hou&s;es improve, we cannot expect them to produce a natural poet, painter, or actor. There are moral as well as natural qualities that exclude each other. The&s;e people, with &s;uch wit and vivacity, mu&s;t perhaps be proportionally deficient in judgment, and mu&s;t be oftener wrong than &s;ome of their cooler and &s;edater neighbours. This to many appears to be actually the ca&s;e. But their genius is again rather re&s;trained and &s;hackled by &s;ome other circum&s;tances&mdash; by tho&s;e already mentioned; by the nature of their government&mdash;by the formation of their language, which, though a very fine one for &s;ome purpo&s;es, is confined, and unfit for others, by being idiomatic and

But I believe that is often the ca&s;e with mo&s;t travellers: &s;o that many wi&s;e re|flections, that might thus have been pro|duced, mu&s;t now be lo&s;t, and thou go unin&s;tructed to thy grave, as the clown &s;ays.</P>
<P>I grant you that an Engli&s;hman may live tolerably well in France, and be well enough amu&s;ed, as many of us have ex|perienced: yet I doubt if there be much real and u&s;eful in&s;truction to be acquired. In the u&s;eful arts, we are already before
<PB N="270" REF="281">
them; and in the fine arts, though we have not done &s;o much, we have not gone &s;o far wrong. Though the&s;e arts have not been &s;o much cultivated and encou|raged among us, what we have produced is more within the bounds of &s;implicity and nature; and we have not, like them, quite &s;o much way to go back in order to regain the right road.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what we may learn on any moral &s;ubjects, as of law, government, or manners; their national character, their ta&s;te, their pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o oppo&s;ite to ours, that I often doubt the u&s;e or applicability to us of &s;uch knowledge. Their life mu&s;t &s;eem at fir&s;t to us unnatural, and they them&s;elves a &s;pecies apart from the re&s;t of human na|ture: yet there is &s;o much incon&s;i&s;tency in mankind, that the&s;e very people take the lead in almo&s;t every thing, and are ob&s;e|quiou&s;ly followed by the re&s;t of Europe. There may be &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for this, when we come to examine the matter. Somebody has written a book called <HI>l'Eu|rope Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e.</HI> Some of the A&s;iatic peo|ple
<PB N="271" REF="282">
call us Europeans all by the name of <HI>Franks,</HI> and con&s;ider us as one nation. We may thank the French for bringing us all to that re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Various reflections will naturally occur to an Engli&s;hman, when he &s;urveys, even here, the con&s;equences of arbitrary pow|er: among the mo&s;t &s;triking of which will be the poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion of the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This government, &s;ince it got the bet|ter of the nobility and the Prote&s;tants, overpowered all oppo&s;ition, and de&s;troyed all the traces of freedom, has hitherto be|haved wonderou&s;ly well, con&s;idering its unlimited abilities to do otherwi&s;e with im|punity, and the natural effects of uncon|trolled power on its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. This may perhaps be attributed to the accidental in|fluence of poli&s;hed manners, &s;cience, and civilization: but I would not promi&s;e or depend much on the continuance of &s;uch moderation, nor on the duration of &s;uch ca&s;ual influence. We can already trace
<PB N="272" REF="283">
the foot&s;teps of de&s;poti&s;m here, and per|ceive her carele&s;s and unfeeling indolence, with many unguarded &s;trokes of her na|tural pride and in&s;olence, and can &s;ee that &s;he mu&s;t, &s;oon or late, break loo&s;e from &s;uch feeble re&s;traints; and that philo&s;o|phers, women, and public opinion, will not always be a &s;ufficient cheque even to her caprices. Though this tyranny is not yet &s;o bad as that of ea&s;tern de&s;poti&s;m, it may terminate &s;omewhat in that way in due time: the people are already obviou&s;ly impoveri&s;hed and oppre&s;&s;ed. Effects mu&s;t follow, and be proportioned to their cau&s;es. Of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of uncontrolled power, a great majority will probably always be &s;poilt by it, in &s;ome degree,&mdash;bodies of men &s;till more than individuals. How different the behaviour of a Cyrus, or an Alexander, before and after the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power? Even the Romans, when once triumphant, &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, tem|perance, and moderation, which had laid the foundation of their empire.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="284">The ancient European nations maintain|ed, for a time, that free and independent &s;pirit, which had been their characteri&s;tic, as wandering tribes. But in that &s;tate of &s;ociety and knowledge, no &s;y&s;tem of pre|cautions and control could be fore&s;een or e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ufficient to &s;ecure their u&s;ual freedom again&s;t the encroachments of ty|ranny, which mu&s;t follow the influence of property, now &s;uperadded to the military authority of their chiefs. The warlike forms and order of the field, tran&s;planted or continued to the fixed &s;ociety, in time produced the feudal &s;y&s;tem; a &s;pecies of government which was &s;oon found to be incompatible with civil liberty, and which aboli&s;hed all former ideas of independence, and of the equal right in each man to whatever he might lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s, though ever &s;o &s;mall; till &s;ociety came gradually to be divided into tyrants and &s;laves.</P>
<P>One of the nece&s;&s;ary productions of that &s;y&s;tem, and perhaps the be&s;t, was that bar|barous &s;pecies of perpetual war, which came afterwards to be a little &s;oftened and
<PB N="274" REF="285">
humanized by the romantic &s;entiments of chivalry. War exerci&s;es and maintains &s;ome of the noble and manly exertions; and tho&s;e who fight are always good for &s;ome|thing.</P>
<P>As men acquire freedom and &s;ecurity, they are known to improve in arts and indu&s;try; in dexterity and divi&s;ion of la|bour: thence a greater number may be maintained in idlene&s;s, and the powers and the happine&s;s of the whole &s;ociety are con|&s;idered as thereby increa&s;ed. But &s;uch is the love of power, that &s;lavery would mo&s;t probably have maintained its ground, though &s;o obviou&s;ly again&s;t the intere&s;t of the whole, and particularly of the ma&s;ters, had it not been for certain accidents and changes in manners and ways of life. The&s;e proceeded probably, at fir&s;t, from that madne&s;s for the cruzades, which &s;o ge|nerally infected Europe, and of which the hi&s;tory is &s;ufficiently known. The nece&s;|&s;ary expences attending tho&s;e expeditions &s;ome increa&s;e of knowledge, ta&s;te, arts and luxuries, brought from the Ea&s;t, pro|duced
<PB N="275" REF="286">
con&s;iderable changes at home; among which was the circulation of property, and the relea&s;e of numbers from a &s;tate of bondage.</P>
<P>The church, you know, likewi&s;e lent a helping hand to the abolition of &s;lavery, partly from religious, and partly from in|tere&s;ted, motives. But dome&s;tic freedom could be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed only in tho&s;e countries which have entirely broken and thrown off the feodal claims. In the de|cline of that &s;y&s;tem it was &s;till doubted by many, whether the abolition of &s;lavery would be of advantage to the people in general? Though it has undoubtedly proved &s;o in England, and &s;ome other countries, the advantages may perhaps &s;till be doubtful where the ab&s;olute power of <HI>one ma&s;ter</HI> has &s;ucceeded to that of the <HI>many;</HI> and were it not for the advances made in arts and civilization, it might yet be a que&s;tion, whether the de&s;poti&s;m of <HI>one</HI> would not be wor&s;e than feodal anar|chy, where that <HI>one</HI> was not a very good man, and a firm and enlightened

philo&s;opher, which we have rea&s;on to fear would &s;eldom be the ca&s;e if the ancient ignorance &s;till prevailed; &s;uch princes be|ing even now rare, with all the advan|tages of modern knowledge and education.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER. XI.</HI> Of Studies and active Pur&s;uits.&mdash;The French and Engli&s;h,&mdash;their Governments.</HEAD>
<P>I MEANT to give you &s;ome travels, as well as reflections; but I think the lat|ter will encroach upon and fill up mo&s;t of your paper. As there may be but little that is new to you remaining for me to tell of the&s;e countries, and as I am perhaps na|turally more of a projector than a retailer of facts and particulars, I &s;hall probably go on frequently to indulge in various &s;pecu|lations upon different &s;ubjects, as they may be called to mind by what I &s;ee.</P>
<P>In my journal I find &s;everal things about French literature, of which I mean to give you &s;ome extracts, as memory and occa|&s;ions may an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="289">In France, and indeed throughout Eu|rope, all things &s;eem in a perpetual change or progre&s;s, which is governed by fa&s;hion. Even virtues, talents, change their places and degrees of e&s;timation in a &s;hort time. In one age, all for fighting; another, all for &s;tudy. Since we began to prefer idle to active pur&s;uits, and to take more credit for what we know and can talk of, than for what we can do, we have fancied every thing was to be learn|ed from reading books, when not too idle even for that occupation.</P>
<P>One perceives the&s;e things more obvi|ou&s;ly here in France, though they proba|bly read le&s;s than you do. Some of their mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible men, I think, place too much dependence on books, and almo&s;t forget that reading can never entirely &s;upply the place of practical knowledge, though a very nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance in order to know or do any thing well. To acquire univer&s;al learn|ing, they &s;eem to think one has only to con|&s;ult their dictionaries&mdash;the form into which they have thrown every art and &s;cience,
<PB N="279" REF="290">
from cookery and hair-dre&s;&s;ing, up to every u&s;eful trade and &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy: a manner of writing which may be of great utility to mankind, if they are taught to take it only for what it is worth, and not to depend on it too much. I wi&s;h &s;uch books to be reduced in &s;ize and price; but they &s;eem, on the contrary, growing bigger and dearer. They might be made to &s;erve as memoranda in all the arts, but cannot teach them. Every thing that faci|litates knowledge to the people, and tends to render each art and &s;cience univer&s;ally known, mu&s;t be of &s;ervice to mankind in general; and their benefit and conveni|ence is certainly at lea&s;t of equal con&s;e|quence with that of tho&s;e few who depend entirely on books for their knowledge, and who are not generally of &s;uch im|portance to &s;ociety. You have ob&s;erved, <HI>chez vous,</HI> &s;ome who, after the mo&s;t labo|rious literary re&s;earches, were found to be novices among the fir&s;t people of practice with whom they had any thing to do, till they began to di&s;cover how far behind real practice, books generally are in mo&s;t of
<PB N="280" REF="291">
the u&s;eful branches. They may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary in every kind, even of practical knowledge, to a certain degree; but then you mu&s;t know where to doubt, and when to leave them.</P>
<P>When the importance of education &s;hall be better under&s;tood, and men &s;hall have learnt to e&s;timate things nearer to their real value, books may more nearly keep pace with practice, and be of more u&s;e to it; and mankind may not then be divided, as now, into two cla&s;&s;es&mdash;the few who read and depend too much on books, and the many who do not read at all. Theory and practice may then become better ac|quainted with each other, and &s;ome prac|tical &s;cience de&s;cend to the lower and mo&s;t u&s;eful ranks of men.</P>
<P>In the French there is an apparent mu|tability, but at bottom a real &s;amene&s;s of character, through all the known periods of their hi&s;tory. Although, in &s;ome former times, they may have &s;tood higher as to
<PB N="281" REF="292">
power, arts, &s;cience, ta&s;te, and great men, there are certain peculiarities which form &s;o in&s;eparably a part of their character, that I believe they mu&s;t have been nearly the &s;ame &s;ort of people at all periods, whether as ancient Gauls, or Francks, or modern French.</P>
<P>But with us Engli&s;h, there is a real fund of mutability, &s;o to &s;peak, if we are con&s;idered either individually or nationally. You know we are reputed as changeable as our climate. We have been a very different &s;ort of people at different periods&mdash;before and after the Reformation, for example. We have taken a new cha|racter even &s;ince the Revolution, and differ much in our manners and di&s;po&s;ition &s;ince the time when Era&s;mus vi&s;ited us; and in our temperament there are perhaps yet the &s;eeds of future revolu|tions.</P>
<P>In the French I &s;ee no &s;ufficient cau&s;es of any great future change or progre&s;s; and they are not now perhaps capable of
<PB N="282" REF="293">
procuring or executing any &s;pecies of go|vernment, very different from, or better than, what they at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which is perhaps now &s;o well adapted to their character, to their habits of think|ing, and ways of life, that a much better may not be wi&s;hed or expected.</P>
<P>There are doubtle&s;s many degrees of good, &s;hort of perfection, which is not to be ob|tained in this world, though it is of va&s;t con&s;equence to keep it in &s;ight, as well as the right to the freedom of inve&s;tigation. Since we &s;ee that the&s;e people can be tole|rably happy in their pre&s;ent condition, it may be &s;aid that the ends of government are fully an&s;wered, as the be&s;t could do no more. Yet, as Engli&s;h, we mu&s;t &s;till &s;ee deficiencies in this their pre&s;ent condition. With all the advantages of a natural, cheer|ful, and happy temper, together with the be&s;t government they can expect to en|joy, we mu&s;t &s;till doubt if they ever can acquire that dignity of nature, and &s;en&s;e of &s;ecurity, which can alone produce the efforts, the enterpri&s;e, the public &s;pirit, and
<PB N="283" REF="294">
progre&s;s of improvement, ob&s;ervable among a free people.</P>
<P>Their government mu&s;t now, e&s;pecially in its internal operations, probably always partake of the national character, and of the defects incident to unlimited power &mdash;prudent and artful, ra&s;h and un&s;teady, enterpri&s;ing or indolent, by turns&mdash;wi&s;|dom and folly, &s;pirit and weakne&s;s, mixed, or alternately taking the lead. But the un|feeling indolence and arrogance of de&s;pot|i&s;m mu&s;t perhaps be expected at length to predominate.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a government, who&s;e cha|racter and operations mu&s;t at be&s;t depend &s;o much on fa&s;hion, or on the views and di&s;po&s;ition of an accidental mini&s;ter, mi&s;|tre&s;s, or favourite, and not upon a fixed con&s;titution, mea&s;ures mu&s;t too frequently change with men; and the completion of any thing great, that requires much time, can hardly be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="295">This mu&s;t be under&s;tood only of their in|ternal or dome&s;tic government; for in their foreign politics they have generally been &s;teady, deep, and artful; perhaps too artful, &s;o as to create &s;u&s;picions, and put nations on their guard, and throw them into confe|deracies again&s;t their &s;ecret arts and grow|ing power.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XII.</HI> French Pre-eminence,&mdash;Arts,&mdash;Trades,&mdash; Intercour&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>IN every country there is probably &s;ome|thing u&s;eful to be learnt; and to this, which has been &s;o long the leading nation in Europe, we all re&s;ort, on purpo&s;e to learn almo&s;t every thing. I think they de&s;erve that pre-eminence, in &s;ome things; though they them&s;elves are too apt to fancy that they do in all. They may go on to de&s;erve it &s;till more, by means of the very advantages attending that pre-eminence. Tho&s;e advantages are many and important. The various and valuable articles of com|merce, the motives to indu&s;try and exer|tion of mind, which the univer&s;ality of their language and their fa&s;hions have procured them, contribute much towards making them an indu&s;trious and almo&s;t
<PB N="286" REF="297">
commercial people, in &s;pite of their govern|ment, which is naturally rather carele&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ive. Though the conce&s;&s;ion of this pre-eminence gives them conceit, it brings emulation along with it, and promotes a beneficial activity in the provinces of ta&s;te and u&s;eful &s;cience. If the &s;tate could be forced into more wi&s;dom and benevolence, it might employ more effectual means to|wards their pre&s;erving the lead in many more things of real importance to national pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Even the article of books, which they write and print for all Europe, is no in|con&s;iderable means of both riches and of exten&s;ive influence, though the Dutch have indu&s;triou&s;ly drawn to them&s;elves a &s;hare in this branch of trade. The univer&s;al prevalence of French modes and manners likewi&s;e facilitates their &s;chemes in foreign politics, which I think they under&s;tand much better than they do the principles of dome&s;tic pro&s;perity. This, with an a&s;&s;idu|ous and liberal attention to their mini&s;ters and con&s;uls abroad, gives them an
<PB N="287" REF="298">
a&s;cendency in all the courts, and a power|ful, though &s;ecret, influence, to the op|po&s;ite extremities, of Europe. You know they govern Spain, though you all &s;eem ignorant of the nature, hi&s;tory, and extent, of that connection: and I am told that they have been even attentive, like the Je&s;uits, to the acquiring &s;ome &s;ecret influ|ence in the education of as many as they can of the young princes in Europe; and that they hope, by &s;uch means, to guide the next Czar of Ru&s;&s;ia, who is already much of a Frenchman.</P>
<P>If this reign continues &s;teady to the prin|ciples in which it &s;eems to begin, they may long lead and manage the politics of Europe &s;ecretly in their own way, and carry all before them.&mdash;Nay, you your|&s;elves may now be only acting in obedi|ence to &s;ome of the &s;ecret impul&s;es given or promoted by this court. We already &s;ee, and may learn, from Madame Pompadour, and others, that one of their maxims will be, to per&s;uade all Europe that they ought to be jealous of the Engli&s;h, who mu&s;t
<PB N="288" REF="299">
therefore be brought down: and they may now &s;ucceed. It will probably long conti|nue a great object with each nation to reduce the other, even at the expence of reducing it&s;elf much more. How much better for each to try to rai&s;e both! but e&s;pecially for France, as &s;he would, in that progre&s;s, gain &s;till a greater &s;uperiority. They might govern the world, if they could keep &s;teady to their principles and to their allies, and not grow in&s;olent by &s;ucce&s;s. But perhaps that is not in human nature; and &s;till le&s;s in French nature. With &s;uc|ce&s;s, a nation never knows where to &s;top. Greatne&s;s knows not where nor how to &s;et bounds to it&s;elf, but generally over&s;hoots the mark, and wears it&s;elf out. Pro&s;pe|rity not only &s;poils us, but creates us enemies. Our late &s;ucce&s;&s;es and &s;upe|riority, in this century, cannot fail of producing yet more combinations again&s;t us, probably before the next.</P>
<P>But, as I was going to ob&s;erve, though we are probably before them in mo&s;t of the arts and trades, that are of the greate&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="300">
u&s;e to mankind, yet there may be much to be learned in this country. The arts and trades form a very exten&s;ive and cu|riou&s;ly connected &s;y&s;tem. Tho&s;e of dif|ferent countries, and even tho&s;e of the &s;ame country, have yet much to learn of each other. An intelligent arti&s;t or trade&s;|man will always find &s;omething to learn in &s;o active and indu&s;trious a nation as this; and I am plea&s;ed to &s;ee our manu|facturers travelling here:&mdash;our Bentleys, Coles, and others, from Birmingham, Man|che&s;ter, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The provinces of ta&s;te and utility are more intimately connected than the world in general have formerly imagined; and happily, the u&s;eful arts are not now beneath the attention of the &s;cholar and the gen|tleman, while your trade&s;men are not all de&s;titute of an u&s;eful and liberal education; though there is yet great room for amend|ment in that way. As tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es ap|proach each other, the better it mu&s;t be for the whole; for the different cla&s;&s;es of arts, &s;ciences, and men, and for &s;ociety in
<PB N="290" REF="301">
general. In mo&s;t other countries, the fine and liberal arts are, as yet, the mere ap|pendages of luxury; they &s;tand alone and aloof from the other arts, their poor relatives, and are therefore of little &s;ervice to the nation.</P>
<P>The philo&s;opher rejoices to &s;ee them de&s;cend among you to an acquaintance with their humble brethren; and all, by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, promoting each other's intere&s;t, which then happily coincides with that of mankind. While you continue to know this, you will yet more liberally pro|mote and facilitate education in general; the reception and encouragement of &s;tran|gers of merit; the travelling of proper &s;tudents to other countries. Your differ|ent trades, companies, manufacturers, &s;hould all zealou&s;ly contribute to &s;upport, for example, &s;uch in&s;titutions as your Royal Academy, with other more &s;cientific &s;chools, and enable them to &s;end youth abroad: you may thereby go on to improve and pre&s;erve &s;uch a &s;uperiority in every thing you produce, founded on &s;cientific
<PB N="291" REF="302">
and mechanical knowledge, and good ta&s;te, as will force them into every country, even in &s;pite of the confined and &s;elfi&s;h views of their mo&s;t fooli&s;h and tyrannical govern|ments.</P>
<P>But if ever you come to be &s;o conceited as to fancy you want no &s;uch foreign a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; that you can proudly &s;talk on alone, and &s;till pre&s;erve your &s;uperiority; it will be a certain &s;ymptom of decline. Shut up in your own i&s;land, you will quickly barbarize into circum&s;cribed na|tionalities; will &s;ink and follow the fate of all nations who have ever given up, or have been deprived of, a &s;ufficient inter|cour&s;e with others. However, let not &s;tudents of ta&s;te &s;top long in France:&mdash;let them get on to Italy at lea&s;t, where &s;ome gems will always be found among their rubbi&s;h, by tho&s;e who can di&s;tingui&s;h. Nay, Italy is yet the country&mdash;the capital of ta&s;te&mdash;and the other nations are only the di&s;tant provinces of that empire. Thi|ther mu&s;t all arti&s;ts re&s;ort to get rid of their provincial and vulgar manners. That
<PB N="292" REF="303">
people, though now &s;o de&s;picable, if once united under a good government, I make no doubt would again &s;oon rule the world. Their talents, their language, would &s;oon appear to be capable of every thing, if the&s;e were once employed and exerci&s;ed on objects worthy of their exer|tions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIII.</HI> French Conver&s;ation and Societies,&mdash;Lan|guage,&mdash;and Singing.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS forming for you catalogues of French authors, with &s;ome &s;hort re|marks, but I now learn that &s;uch things have been already &s;o often done, that it mu&s;t be needle&s;s to fill up your letters with &s;uch intelligence. The French, you know, have long and liberally encouraged all the arts and &s;ciences, and have generally pre|&s;umed to take the lead in learning as well as in ta&s;te; and, what has &s;till more in|fluence, it has lately become the fa&s;hion, among both &s;exes, to philo&s;ophize, and form &s;ocieties for that purpo&s;e. If this ta&s;te &s;hould continue for a &s;ufficient length of time, the French ladies may prove to be very good philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, and may help to make many others. They may be the means of extending knowledge,
<PB N="294" REF="305">
and of producing &s;uch beneficial effects as would here be impo&s;&s;ible without their influence. Students may certainly meet in France with more a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and more readily in Paris, than with us, in conver|&s;ation, in public libraries, and lectures.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation is the <HI>fort</HI> of this people. From thence we may gather more plea|&s;ure and improvement than any where el&s;e. They are &s;o thoroughly agreeable and communicative, and always ready to give you all they know: &s;o that the reading of a very few may &s;erve the whole nation, and al&s;o benefit many of us vi&s;itors. You may meet here with whole &s;ocieties, genteel, agreeable, and apparently well informed, where only one or two, or perhaps none of them, ever read; not even on the &s;ub|jects upon which their &s;ociety is formed, and their conver&s;ation chiefly turns. They pick up what they think &s;ufficient inform|ation, at &s;econd or third hand, among their friends. The knowledge of one thus &s;preads through a great number; and hence their knack at talking &s;o well on
<PB N="295" REF="306">
&s;ubjects which they have never &s;tudied, and which they &s;urpri&s;e us by &s;eeming to un|der&s;tand almo&s;t as well as many of tho&s;e who have gone through all the tedious forms of the &s;chools.</P>
<P>It is difficult to gain admittance to the be&s;t company here, as well as every where el&s;e. Nor in any country do the comfort|able, little, &s;en&s;ible, and familiar, &s;ocieties ea&s;ily admit of &s;trangers; and &s;till le&s;s of fo|reigners: but where, by letters or friends, you are once received, you will find them more communicative and agreeable than almo&s;t any where el&s;e. However, I think, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and be&s;t informed among them have, like tho&s;e among our&s;elves, &s;omething re&s;erved and retired, and even &s;ometimes <HI>un peu mi&s;anthrope.</HI> Shall we doubt if knowledge encrea&s;es our happi|ne&s;s? We may, &mdash; if the knowledge of men's follies and wickedne&s;s is to keep us perpetually out of humour with them.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s &s;ome of the&s;e ob&s;ervations mu&s;t have often been made before, though
<PB N="296" REF="307">
I have not &s;een them, having purpo&s;ely rather avoided reading much on tho&s;e mat|ters, that I may, without prejudice, &s;ee with my own eyes. Others have occurred, on attending with a little more applica|tion than time and opportunities had hi|therto permitted me to give to their agree|able language,&mdash;to its &s;ounds and forma|tion. With all its defects, it is certain|ly the language of pro&s;e, as &s;omebody has ob&s;erved; and more e&s;pecially of con|ver&s;ation. You &s;ee it has already been, and may &s;till be, of great &s;ervice to man|kind as a general and convenient medium of communication; and now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that privilege, will probably keep it, were it only from the central &s;ituation of this country; as &s;everal nations, in order to vi&s;it each other, mu&s;t pa&s;s through France. The French &s;eem formed for &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e, and their language made on pur|po&s;e to indulge them in it.</P>
<P>Though their conver&s;ation is, in gene|ral, trivial, to a degree beyond what you
<PB N="297" REF="308">
may conceive, yet the power of cu&s;tom or habit, together with their agreeable man|ner, their delicate pronunciation and phra|&s;eology, will &s;oon render mo&s;t of it at lea&s;t &s;upportable, and much of it highly agreeable. As we become greater adepts, and can expre&s;s our&s;elves with ea&s;e, many new beauties and delicacies of the language begin to appear, and to plea&s;e us. We become better plea&s;ed with our&s;elves; and that helps greatly to embelli&s;h every thing around us. And among &s;uch a variety of people, a cho&s;en few may always be found who are at once learned, &s;en&s;ible, and agreeable.</P>
<P>Still I think, for &s;ome other purpo&s;es, this language is defective or limited. Con|&s;i&s;ting much of fixed idioms and favourite expre&s;&s;ions, though clear and preci&s;e, with little variety of order or arrangement, in &s;ome re&s;earches it may, like books in ge|neral, carry the mind a certain length, or in a certain tract; but then it will tend to keep it there, and furni&s;h but little encouragement or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to go farther. For the&s;e, and
<PB N="298" REF="309">
other &s;imilar rea&s;ons,&mdash;from an affectation and refinement peculiar to this people, and generally the fruits of civilization,&mdash;from the compo&s;ition of its &s;ounds, articulations, and accents,&mdash;I think this language almo&s;t totally unfit for poetry, and entirely unfit for mu&s;ic. But to &s;ee how in&s;en&s;ible the natives are to the&s;e defects of their own language, is vexatious and melancholy. One of the heavie&s;t taxes I have to pay for living among them is, being obliged to hear them &s;ing. For though their language is &s;o to|tally unfit to be &s;ung, and they them&s;elves, with that unfortunate manner of theirs, &s;uch horrid &s;ingers, yet, from one end of the kingdom to the other, they are eter|nally attempting it. I have more than once been obliged to change my habitation in order to get away from &s;ome &s;inging coblers or &s;ervants. Our own manner of &s;inging is not perhaps a great deal better; but we are not &s;o fond of teazing other people with our performance.</P>
<P>Whenever we treat of &s;ounds, I think terms are wanting, and mu&s;t probably be
<PB N="299" REF="310">
always deficient or inadequate in repre|&s;enting to the eye the objects of hearing. The French way of &s;inging may be called a bur&s;ting, and the Engli&s;h a choking, manner: the fir&s;t, an outrageous and vul|gar expre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion or of bodily pain; the &s;econd is the expre&s;&s;ion of nothing, but a kind of fal&s;e and unfeeling notion of grace. Both have generally &s;ome kind of violence or unea&s;ine&s;s in the manner and expre&s;&s;ion, which gives pain to the unac|cu&s;tomed hearer. The climate, the lan|guage, give generally to our northern fe|male voices a kind of har&s;h or defective tone; and to the men a hoar&s;e or choking one. It is only &s;ome of the ba&s;s voices, in either France or England, that I can bear to hear with any plea&s;ure. The voices to the north of the Alps and the Py|rennees are all, I think, very di&s;tingui&s;hable and defective.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIV.</HI> On the Revival of Ta&s;te and Science, and Decline.</HEAD>
<P>WE have rea&s;on to be both thankful and &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;cience and good ta&s;te have recovered &s;o much and &s;o &s;oon from the blows they have received at dif|ferent times, from various cau&s;es. They began to decline with the fall of the Greek empire, and almo&s;t totally expired with that of the Romans, by the irruptions of the rude northern nations. Their revival was long prevented by that exce&s;s of wild devotion which cautioned and prejudiced the people again&s;t the prophane learning of the Gentiles, and bani&s;hed almo&s;t all ideas of the beautiful and &s;ublime. Latterly, after a con&s;iderable re&s;toration of ta&s;te and &s;cience, by the Italians, and the riches of the church, our happy reformation cer|tainly reverted a little towards barbari&s;m,
<PB N="301" REF="312">
by a puritanical enthu&s;ia&s;m; and by ex|cluding the fine arts from the temples, gave them a check which all your riches of commerce and freedom have not yet been able to recover; nor probably ever will, till you become liberal-minded enough to admit them again to that &s;anctuary. Ge|nius requires the attention of a whole pub|lic, and her works mu&s;t be judged by the world at large. The private wealth and private hou&s;es of rich individuals, though a con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can never, I fear, prove an encouragement nor a theatre &s;uf|ficient to excite her greate&s;t exertions, or to in&s;pire her &s;ublime&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. Though our church is now neither &s;o rich nor &s;o powerful as formerly, yet &s;he might &s;till encourage the arts, and might furni&s;h the motives they probably want the mo&s;t, viz. tho&s;e proceeding from honour, competition, liberality, public &s;pi|rit, devotion.</P>
<P>Your Royal Academy, while directed by the good &s;en&s;e and good ta&s;te of a man who forms an aera in his country, doubtle&s;s
<PB N="302" REF="313">
has done, and may yet do, much towards the revival of true ta&s;te: and it might yet do more, if half of tho&s;e works it has pro|duced could be kept together, to form a la&s;ting exhibition,&mdash;a perpetual &s;chool, and a vi&s;ible hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of the arts; whereas the effects of tho&s;e works are al|mo&s;t lo&s;t by their di&s;per&s;ion and di&s;appear|ance after a &s;hort glance of the public eye. Greater and more magnificent, more pub|lic as well as more permanent exhibitions and encouragements, are nece&s;&s;ary. Ho|nour and fame are the great objects of ge|nius, more than pecuniary rewards, which, by a wi&s;e and liberal admixture of honours and attentions, may be oeconomi&s;ed and made ju&s;t &s;ufficient, for they may be too great as well as too &s;mall;&mdash;&s;o far are riches alone from being competent to the purpo&s;es in que&s;tion. The advantages of the churches, and of a few public galleries, contribute greatly to maintain a ta&s;te in the arts in &s;ome countries, even in &s;pite of the op|pre&s;&s;ions of poverty and de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="314">It may be time to take precautions like|wi&s;e again&s;t another &s;ource of the decline or corruption of ta&s;te. The love of orna|ment is progre&s;&s;ive, and in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teals upon us, with the progre&s;s of civilization and refinement, to a vicious exce&s;s: and they who bring us back towards &s;impli|city, before we entirely lo&s;e the reli&s;h for it, &s;urely de&s;erve well of the public. I &s;u&s;pect your having lately advanced too far in this career. Let us hope that your gen|tlemen of ta&s;te and &s;cience, your pre&s;ident and &s;ome others of your fir&s;t arti&s;ts, may &s;ucceed in correcting or recovering you from that di&s;tempered ta&s;te which, I fear, was leading you fa&s;t towards a decline, through the u&s;ual road of indulgence in perpetual change and novelty, long before you had reached the &s;ummit of elegant &s;implicity and the true &s;ublime. Your <HI>co|lifichet</HI> of a thing for a public bank, certain hou&s;es, rooms, and cielings, gave but too many indications of your going too fa&s;t and too far. Perhaps no ornamental archi|tecture higher than the Doric, or at mo&s;t the Ionic, ought to appear to the open air,
<PB N="304" REF="315">
in your climate, and more e&s;pecially in great public buildings. Of the fine arts, architecture is probably the fir&s;t that does and &s;hould improve, and has a tendency to give a tone and &s;ome limits to the re&s;t. But perhaps it cannot &s;o &s;oon advance to any great height in a brick country.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the ta&s;te of commerce and of &s;uddenly acquired riches, is &s;eldom cha&s;te. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are in too great ha&s;te to en|joy every thing with a coar&s;e and untu|tored appetite; they mu&s;t have butter to their pork, as the Spaniards &s;ay.

Let us therefore encourage the &s;imple and &s;ublime, while we have yet &s;ome reli&s;h and &s;ome advocates for it. It is to be hoped that one who &s;hould build like Jones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Covent Garden church.</NOTE>, or write like Swift, would &s;till be liked.</P>

Without a con&s;tant communication with other na|tions, your ta&s;te and your works of art will be apt to favour of your &s;eparate and in&s;ular &s;ituation. You will get into nar|row and limited paths of your own, and become mere manieri&s;ts, at be&s;t; and your productions will be marked and vulgarized by &s;omething peculiar, like a provincial accent: or when you venture out beyond &s;uch limits, you will probably be enticed into tho&s;e of Affectation.&mdash;Pray beware of that bewitching jade:&mdash;but I think few of the moderns can entirely e&s;cape her.&mdash;It &s;eems as if &s;he had taken up her principal abode in this country.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XV.</HI> On Women.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mrs. P&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE women of this country, their &s;ingular, and, I think, &s;uperior, cha|racter, claim a great &s;hare of attention both from the natives and &s;trangers; and tend to furni&s;h me with &s;ome perhaps new ideas and &s;peculations on this and other connected &s;ubjects. The natural ea&s;e and boldne&s;s of their manner and deportment, the numberle&s;s graces of their addre&s;s and conver&s;ation, their familiarity and facility of acce&s;s, their re&s;tle&s;s vivacity, their ex|ten&s;ive knowledge, the credit and weight of their opinions, are all very &s;triking to a &s;tranger; and being generally enough known, I &s;hall not dwell upon them. Our ideas of their indelicacy being mea&s;ured by a &s;tandard of our own, and taken from the
<PB N="308" REF="319">
exce&s;&s;ive nicety of our own <HI>petits maitres et petites maitre&s;&s;es,</HI> other nations do not readily admit of nor under&s;tand. However, I think the two nations may in many ways improve each other; and a female charac|ter, formed of the be&s;t qualities of both, might be &s;uperior to either: our ladies might perhaps be improved by the acqui&s;i|tion of &s;ome of their <HI>franchi&s;e</HI> and bolder graces; and theirs, in their turn, by a little of our female <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</HI> &s;en&s;ibility, and ingenuous &s;implicity.</P>
<P>You know I have long entertained &s;ome opinions concerning women, and the fe|male character in general, which may ap|pear rather &s;ingular to &s;ome, though not to you; and in which I am the more con|firmed by what I have been led to think and ob&s;erve here. You and <HI>Twee</HI> have contributed largely to lead me into the&s;e notions, and are therefore bound to cor|rect and improve them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e two valuable women, Mrs. Pilcher and Mrs. Commi&s;&s;ioner Proby of Roche&s;ter, will long, long be feel|ingly remembered and lamented by many as &s;uperior cha|racters, and &s;ingularly confidential friends to each other. Their exalted good &s;en&s;e, their &s;entiments and ideas, went far beyond the age in which they lived, though not a had nor an ignorant age. Had they been &s;pared to us a little longer, the&s;e Letters might have made a better ap|pearance. Their friend&s;hip had this &s;ingularity in it, that the di&s;covery of the merits of each was owing to the other. &mdash;The truth of this, and the reality of their great &s;en&s;e and merit, are become more evident &s;ince their death.</NOTE>. I think then, that
<PB N="309" REF="320">
women have nowhere yet attained their proper place and u&s;es in &s;ociety,&mdash;not even here in poli&s;hed Europe,&mdash;though the ex|ample of this leading nation &s;hews us at lea&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of it, and that we may now be in a progre&s;s towards the right ideas on this point.</P>
<P>I have thought that the be&s;t remedies to tho&s;e evils mentioned in my la&s;t, and to many others, may be hoped for, from the admi&s;&s;ion of women to a better education, and to more influence in the councils of ta&s;te and learning; and it might perhaps be as well if they were not entirely exclud|ed from any other councils. Happily they
<PB N="310" REF="321">
&s;eem of late to have gradually ri&s;en in con&s;ideration and utility in this and &s;ome other countries, and it is hoped they may go on to ri&s;e to that equality with men in natural rights, and in the u&s;e of their ta|lents, which &s;eems intended by nature. The rank and con&s;ideration of the &s;ex mu&s;t probably always follow the degrees of civilization. Yet, in the hi&s;tory of na|tions, we &s;ee great variety in this; and we know from Sparta, that a wi&s;e govern|ment might do much towards modeling their character, and directing their edu|cation to the public good.</P>
<P>From &s;uch gradual improvement of the &s;ex, and hence in the con&s;titution of &s;oci|ety, con&s;i&s;ts the only hope I can &s;ee of a remedy to that growing di&s;po&s;ition to in|dulgence, affectation, and perpetual change, which attends on civilization, arts, and ta&s;te, and which &s;o &s;oon entices us out of the paths of good &s;en&s;e, that we are &s;o long in finding, and which finally leads to ruin. In Europe, to &s;top this progre&s;&s;ion, would not probably be either practicable or
<PB N="311" REF="322">
advantageous: to retard or direct it aright, &s;eems to be the object that we &s;hould keep in view, and can only be attained by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other &s;ex. Of the attempts of ea&s;tern legi&s;lators to arre&s;t the natural progre&s;s and improvement of the human &s;pecies, the effects and &s;ucce&s;s have not been &s;uch as to be recommended or imi|tated in Europe. Were this a country of freedom, and the female education to go on to be yet more liberal and manly, in addition to their pre&s;ent numerous and agreeable acquirements, from the joint en|deavours of both &s;exes, I can conceive this might then be a pattern of good govern|ment, and, as a central and leading nation, might really improve the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>The talents or abilities of the &s;exes are probably nearly equal, when equally culti|vated: or, if &s;ome mental con&s;titutional differences exi&s;t, the&s;e are not greater than between individuals of the &s;ame &s;ex, and not beyond the power of habit and educa|tion to a&s;&s;imilate and equalize.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="323">Among the mo&s;t perfect animals, the &s;exes &s;eem to approach the neare&s;t to equality. In the human &s;pecies it is diffi|cult to determine which &s;ex has the advan|tage. In con&s;idering tho&s;e &s;mall native differences, I am &s;ometimes inclined to give it in favour of the female character. If the men have &s;ome important advantages in mental and bodily force, the female mind &s;eems to inherit others more nume|rous, and to be more univer&s;al. Formed, as it were, of a finer pa&s;te, women &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s greater degrees of &s;en&s;ibility,&mdash; quicker and nicer perceptions. They are thereby admirably well con&s;tituted to be our companions and a&s;&s;i&s;tants in almo&s;t every occupation; more tractable, ea&s;ier taught, and moulded into habits, they po&s;&s;e&s;s from nature, or can &s;ooner ac|quire, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential habit of controll|ing and regulating &s;elf indulgence. They can thus more ea&s;ily &s;top the &s;ource of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ions, and hence of the greate&s;t evils in life: and, when once rai&s;ed to all the influence and knowledge of which they are capable, they may teach us to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="324">On temperance, or the management of indulgence, depend our be&s;t habits and di&s;po&s;itions,&mdash;the enjoyment of everything, &mdash;the duration of good ta&s;te, of life, of &s;o|ciety it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Even now, if we were &s;trictly to e&s;ti|mate the con&s;olations the &s;ex afford us, the patience and other virtues they teach us, how much of our happine&s;s, and even of our wi&s;dom, proceeds from them, we &s;hould perhaps be a&s;toni&s;hed, and too proud or a&s;hamed to &s;tate fairly the ac|count.&mdash;How much more might we not expect from their talents and their virtues, if the&s;e were properly improved by edu|cation! We may venture to predict that they will always an&s;wer and repay all the endeavours and attentions we may chu&s;e to be&s;tow on their education; and will gene|rally keep up to any opinion and expecta|tions we may venture to entertain of their character and abilities; and, in &s;hort, will always be nearly what we chu&s;e them to be. I think I have ob&s;erved, in &s;everal different countries, that wherever the men
<PB N="314" REF="325">
and women live, and are mo&s;t employed, together, there re&s;ults a &s;imilarity of cha|racter,&mdash;the powers and exertions, the good order, of the whole, are much encrea&s;ed. Such are the countries in the northern mountains of Spain, among &s;ome of tho&s;e in Switzerland, Germany, and, remarka|bly &s;o, here in France. The effects of a thorough &s;ubordination and &s;eparation be|tween the &s;exes, as in A&s;ia, the character and condition of &s;ociety in &s;uch countries, are well enough known, it is hoped, to put us on our guard again&s;t every thing that has a tendency towards &s;uch ab&s;urd and pernicious tyranny, the natural enemy of &s;ocial happine&s;s, and of all the elegant arts in life. From the con&s;tant intercour&s;e and mutual inclinations of the &s;exes, and their perpetual efforts to plea&s;e, proceed all the fine arts and elegant refinements, and mo&s;t of our be&s;t habits. Women &s;hould per|haps take the lead in the&s;e, as naturally the be&s;t judges of elegance of every kind, in men and things, per&s;onal and intellec|tual.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="326">Fine ta&s;te in Greece and Rome has been &s;een to decline through an exce&s;s of orna|ment; and, in more modern times, we have &s;een her take nearly the &s;ame route, through the <HI>concetti</HI> of Italy, and the <HI>cul|tos</HI> of Spain: and I &s;uppo&s;e we have no right to expect that the leading nations of the pre&s;ent age, France and England, can avoid the downhill paths that &s;eem marked out by nature for arts and civilization. If po&s;&s;ible to retard or avert this natural de|cline, or to change its cour&s;e, I think it mu&s;t be done by the good education and joint endeavours of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>Though a proper education has &s;eldom but by accident fallen to the lot of women, tho&s;e accidental in&s;tances are in favour of the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, if more generally attempted. The pains be&s;towed on them are &s;eldomer, I believe, thrown away than on the other &s;ex. As we open to them the &s;ources of &s;cience, and of the mo&s;t manly virtues, we &s;hall find they will plentifully partake. Their more pliant character and under&s;tandings will be readily rai&s;ed and
<PB N="316" REF="327">
improved, and they will amply repay us with intere&s;t, as companions and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, as mothers and tutors.</P>
<P>The union of acquired dignity with their natural &s;oftne&s;s, of the manly with the be|nevolent virtues, would produce the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and beneficial effects on &s;ociety: and accordingly I think we find the few accompli&s;hed learned and manly female characters, that are known in hi&s;tory and in our own times, have generally had all the &s;ucce&s;s, and have produced the effects, here indicated; and they have been the means of rai&s;ing them&s;elves, and mankind around them, to their highe&s;t honours. Among the in&s;tances that may be taken from the times of chivalry,&mdash;from Eng|land, Ru&s;&s;ia, and from the catalogue of &s;overeigns in general,&mdash;the females cer|tainly out&s;hine the males, in proportion to their numbers. And all know the influ|ence and importance of great and wi&s;e women, in families as in empires, from the mother of the Gracchi down to our pre&s;ent queen.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="328">When we become wi&s;e and liberal enough to elevate and improve, and &s;uf|ficiently con&s;ult, the &s;ex, we may acquire from them every virtue and every &s;enti|ment that leads mo&s;t directly to happine&s;s. They will teach us to control our pa&s;|&s;ions, to regulate and oeconomi&s;e our plea&s;ures, and, in&s;tead of promoting, they will &s;et bounds to luxury and indulgence, and will &s;top the decline of good ta&s;te with that of manners and morals.</P>

And I think the objections you mention, and &s;everal others, would be ea&s;ily an&s;wer|ed.&mdash;But I &s;hall only detain you by a few more remarks as they occur.</P>
<P>Though we &s;hould grant that our living &s;o much with the women indi&s;criminately, as the French do here, might not an&s;wer &s;o well for us at pre&s;ent; and though the
<PB N="319" REF="330">
company of the giddy and unthinking fair might, at fir&s;t, tend to enervate and induce to idlene&s;s, and neglect of more &s;erious and u&s;eful application; give them a liberal education, and &s;uitable employ, and the danger will cea&s;e. If &s;ome of them are now too gay and thoughtle&s;s, the be&s;t remedy will be the endeavouring to make them le&s;s &s;o, and not by running away from them. While we preclude them from every oc|cupation that gives &s;elf-importance, from all management of the public, and even of their own affairs, we have no right to com|plain of the con&s;equences, of which a life and character of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation may be among the lea&s;t pernicious. To attempt depriving them of their natural in|fluence, would be futile, and a beginning at the wrong end; rather qualify them to exert it to &s;ome good purpo&s;es. If, by the addition of knowledge, rea&s;on, and dig|nity, they become quite irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;o much the better then;&mdash;they are nearly &s;o now, without all tho&s;e qualifications. In &s;hort, &s;ince we have begun to rai&s;e the &s;ex from &s;ervitude, we mu&s;t probably go on, till we
<PB N="320" REF="331">
bring them as near to an equality as nature will permit. There is no medium in this. They cannot &s;top long where they are. Every remaining mark of inferiority only &s;o far deba&s;es their minds, and &s;ets them upon re&s;toring that equality by &s;ecret and &s;ini&s;ter arts, which mu&s;t participate too much of deceit. We mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, al|low them every art or artifice that tends to render them more amiable, <HI>et a far la ri|tro&s;a,</HI> where nature &s;eems to have made it nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;but no more. While we render it nece&s;&s;ary in mo&s;t of their conduct, we &s;hall have to complain of their deceit and duplicity.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent &s;triking differences between the male and female character, are more the effect of art than of nature; &s;uch is the power of education, which ought to be employed in improving, and not in deba&s;ing nature; and &s;hould not be u&s;ed to widen that &s;eparation, but rather in bringing them nearer to|gether.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="332">The female dre&s;s &s;hould have a nearer re&s;emblance to that of men,&mdash;and e&s;pecially when they ride, which they &s;hould al&s;o do like us. In England, their pre&s;ent &s;illy and perilous mode of riding is a&s;cribed to Queen Elizabeth,&mdash;but it is now &s;urely high time to leave it off. I rejoice to &s;ee that &s;ome women of fa&s;hion have &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough to adopt, on that occa&s;ion, our dre&s;s nearly, and our manner of riding entirely, and in mo&s;t other countries, to &s;ee it common with all ranks: and to &s;ee the female riding-dre&s;s approaching gradually towards a re&s;emblance to ours. They ought to wear drawers under their pre&s;ent, or &s;ome more graceful, long dre&s;s; though not quite &s;o long as the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion: the &s;ex would certainly gain by &s;hewing a little more of their legs:&mdash;there is a ju&s;t medium between &s;hewing all and concealing all. Such things, though appa|rently trifling, may have great influence on the female character.</P>
<P>But the French mu&s;t probably long lead the fa&s;hions in dre&s;s, and &s;everal other
<PB N="322" REF="333">
things. How many follies, and how many improvements, does Europe owe to this nation? Had it not been for the pre|valence of their manners, Italian and Spa|ni&s;h jealou&s;y would probably have extend|ed throughout Europe, &s;o as to exclude the &s;ex almo&s;t entirely from &s;ociety; whence arts and civilization would gradually have di&s;appeared,&mdash;de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;barbari&s;m would again have reigned over the face of the earth. However, in this of pre&s;cribing our dre&s;s, it is rather doubtful if they are entitled to the authority they have &s;o long a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed, with &s;uch a mix|ture of &s;en&s;e and levity, of good and fal&s;e ta&s;te. In their pur&s;uit of variety, it is however rather &s;urpri&s;ing that they have hardly ever &s;tumbled upon any dre&s;s of good &s;en&s;e,&mdash;on &s;ome Greek or other graceful and convenient mode of clothing our&s;elves. We al&s;o owe to them this vio|lent and ridiculous difference of appear|ance between the &s;exes, as if they were animals of a different &s;pecies. The mode of dre&s;s I think of more importance than
<PB N="323" REF="334">
generally believed:&mdash;but I will not detain you with it.</P>
<P>Every thing that tends to produce an equality and re&s;emblance between the &s;exes, I think of con&s;equence; and to me it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee them approaching towards it in this country;&mdash;though one would rather wi&s;h the women to become more manly, than the men more feminine, which is too often the ca&s;e here. Though we act the tyrants over the female part of &s;ociety with more politene&s;s than in &s;ome former and ruder times, yet all the roman|tic non&s;en&s;e of modern gallantry and af|fected regard for the &s;ex, the remains of chivalry, though better than nothing, we know to be an in&s;ufficient re&s;traint on man, and on his real power and a&s;&s;umed &s;upe|riority. I fear nothing but a legal and acknowledged equality, and a liberal edu|cation, can &s;ecure to women their natural rights and influence, nor give to &s;ociety all the benefits of their powers and talents.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="335">Many of tho&s;e female weakne&s;&s;es which we term delicacy, &amp;c. and pretend to ad|mire, we &s;ecretly laugh at;&mdash;or when our ta&s;te is &s;o far vitiated as really to like them, it is chiefly from their being &s;ymptoms of inferiority and &s;ubordination, that &s;ooths and feeds our pride and domineering &s;pirit. In that road we may go on to endle&s;s and unnatural refinements, if not controlled in time;&mdash;but for that purpo&s;e we want wi&s;e and manly women, who, for our &s;akes and their own, mu&s;t &s;hame us out of &s;uch non&s;en&s;ical weakne&s;s, and bring us back to &s;en&s;e and nature. Beauty belongs more to &s;trength than to weakne&s;s.&mdash;Nay, force is nece&s;&s;ary to beauty and graceful motion. The be&s;t &s;tatues of Venus, and &s;till more of Diana, are &s;o well proportioned as to give ideas at once of &s;trength, agility, and of beauty. Strength of body and of mind are perfectly compatible with &s;oft|ne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of manner.</P>
<P>Though it has been ob&s;erved that mind is of no &s;ex, yet there mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be always &s;ome obvious and radical di&s;tinc|tions
<PB N="325" REF="336">
between us in character and occupa|tion. I only plead for tho&s;e di&s;tinctions being reduced to what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, and no more. The re&s;emblance can never be complete, and mu&s;t ever be &s;uf|ficiently limited by nature. The merits and effects of this way of proceeding would depend more on the con&s;tant en|deavours towards an approximation than in the completion of it; as human happi|ne&s;s, in general, con&s;i&s;ts more in action than in the acqui&s;ition of that re&s;t and re|po&s;e which &s;eems to be the only object of all our activity.&mdash;Only remove the too great diver&s;ity and &s;eparation of our occu|pations and education; let the ta&s;ks of life be properly divided between us, and carried on by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance wherever it is practicable, and they will be much bet|ter performed.

<P>I CAN readily obey you, and go on with the favourite &s;ubject of my la&s;t, though the digre&s;&s;ion may appear tedious to &s;ome of your &s;ociety. You, and certain French ladies, led me into it, and others come ju&s;t <HI>apropos</HI> to detain me there. Some of them are certainly charming creatures! &s;o live|ly! &s;o intelligent! <HI>et remplies d' e&s;prit, de graces, et de &s;cience.</HI> We have ju&s;t been to &s;ee palaces, churches, and pictures, with Madame M&mdash;. Her conver&s;ation is de|lightful,&mdash;free and manly, yet with &s;uffi|cient delicacy for me, though not perhaps for all of you, with your cold Engli&s;h re|finements.&mdash;Her ob&s;ervations &s;hewed great judgment, ta&s;te, and even genius. She has been critici&s;ing their philo&s;ophers, one by one, in a fine &s;train of graceful good
<PB N="327" REF="338">
humour and good &s;en&s;e, and with a fund of &s;cience, as yet but too little known among our Engli&s;h ladies.&mdash;But &s;he un|luckily would favour us with &s;ome of her cho&s;en <HI>airs d' oper&agrave;,&mdash;et d' un gout et d' une maniere,&mdash;a faire piti&eacute;,&mdash;enfin nationale.</HI>&mdash; What a pity they cannot have a better ta&s;te in mu&s;ic,&mdash;but, I fear, it is impo&s;&s;ible with &s;uch a language as theirs.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is happy for this country that the women have acquired &s;uch influence, take the lead, and govern in almo&s;t every thing: and hence it is perhaps, that things go on &s;o much better than could be ex|pected with &s;uch an arbitrary and unfeel|ing government. Though this is a corrupt and intriguing kind of influence, and would be far better if e&s;tabli&s;hed and avowed, yet even now it is much better than none. They are probably the means of mitigating the follies and natural &s;everi|ties of tyranny, and the cau&s;e of much good being done which would otherwi&s;e be neglected; and, in conjunction with the philo&s;ophers, they may come to guide
<PB N="328" REF="339">
and direct the public opinion, which mu&s;t always be re&s;pected by the mo&s;t ab&s;olute governments, and is &s;o here, to a degree you might not expect.</P>
<P>Although, with us, the impediments to the elevation and proper employment of women, are probably greater than in France, from certain differences in opi|nions, manners, and ways of life, and as the &s;exes with you are not occupied, nor live together &s;o much as they do here; yet we too can boa&s;t of many excellent female characters, and of &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;elf-taught female writers who have made a figure, and have probably done &s;ome good to mankind by their writings. Our women are certainly formed by nature equal at lea&s;t to any others in &s;everal e&s;|&s;ential qualities,&mdash;in beauty, in &s;entiment, &mdash;with the fine&s;t hearts and affections,&mdash; warm and &s;teady in their attachments. But we cannot contradict the &s;tranger, who finds them generally cold and re&s;erved in conver&s;ation. Their apparently in&s;ipid man|ner probably &s;trikes foreigners, who will
<PB N="329" REF="340">
require time and experience to di&s;cover that there can be any warmth of &s;oul un|der &s;uch cold appearances. However, an u&s;eful and manly education, built upon &s;uch &s;olid good qualities, would give them a prodigious &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Private dome&s;tic education I think ge|nerally the be&s;t, e&s;pecially for females. If this &s;hould luckily ever prevail over that of boarding-&s;chools, the defects of the latter mu&s;t &s;urely become more and more con|&s;picuous; for they will probably grow wor&s;e as the expence of them increa&s;es. The world will &s;urely &s;oon begin to &s;ee that the time and money be&s;towed,&mdash;the fal&s;e and u&s;ele&s;s ideas,&mdash; the habits of idle|ne&s;s, indifference, or extravagance, all too generally acquired in tho&s;e &s;eminaries,&mdash;is paying much too dear for the chance of a few very unimportant accompli&s;hments, and in which &s;o few make any progre&s;s equal to what they probably would do at home. Though &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;chools are well conducted by excellent and valuable women, yet &s;uch places can never &s;uffici|ently
<PB N="330" REF="341">
re&s;emble families, which are the foundation of &s;ociety, and the materials of which it is formed; and in them all the duties and habits of life &s;hould be acquired.</P>
<P>Mothers, though frequently with us, as yet, but moderately accompli&s;hed, might neverthele&s;s in&s;truct their children and them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time, by a very little foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this way we might produce more &s;uperior female cha|racters, and more mothers properly quali|fied for this duty; and we &s;hould thereby, in my opinion, improve the world very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor can I conceive with &s;ome, that we &s;hould have le&s;s, but certainly more, con|jugal happine&s;s in the world, by an increa&s;e of female wi&s;dom and knowledge,&mdash;by means of more numerous and more im|portant objects of mutual intercour&s;e and employ. I have known examples that confirm me in this opinion; nor can I re|linqui&s;h it on account of one or two &s;tu|dious females, who have been perhaps too
<PB N="331" REF="342">
much engro&s;&s;ed by &s;ome favourite branch of &s;tudy, and who might &s;eem to neglect them&s;elves and their families in other things.</P>
<P>It is generally admitted that there are many more employments and profe&s;&s;ions well adapted to the talents and temperament of women than they have yet exerci&s;ed among you, and which they might pro|bably fill with at lea&s;t as much credit and propriety as men:&mdash;but in all, I would have both &s;exes to join in &s;ome degree, and each to lend the helping hand of relief, whenever it is po&s;&s;ible. Women might be of great u&s;e in all the learned and &s;eden|tary profe&s;&s;ions: the&s;e, in my opinion, might then be carried to greater perfec|tion, and with much le&s;s confinement to the &s;tudious, if both &s;exes were properly qualified to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve each other. There is not a more unnatural being than a man who&s;e life is totally engro&s;&s;ed by what we moderns call learning. The con|finement and exclu&s;ive attention to books will generally de&s;troy or impair his natu|ral
<PB N="332" REF="343">
vigour and activity, till he becomes a weak, unhealthy, and a very helple&s;s crea|ture.</P>
<P>Women we have &s;een, in &s;ome coun|tries, uniting their exertions with tho&s;e of their hu&s;bands and relations, even in labo|rious employments; and I am glad to find that of late it has become more cu&s;tomary in your manufacturing counties.</P>
<P>Proceeding on this principle, I think that the children of both &s;exes &s;hould be edu|cated together and alike, as far as propri|ety and manners would admit, which would be far enough for every good pur|po&s;e, if it were once the cu&s;tom. But we are now prejudiced and accu&s;tomed to a &s;eparate and totally different education, as if we were beings of a different &s;pecies, without connection or intercour&s;e, and each &s;ex is to be prepared for employments or profe&s;&s;ions in which the other is not even &s;uppo&s;ed to judge, and therefore cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t. In families where brothers and &s;i&s;|ters are brought up a good deal together,
<PB N="333" REF="344">
it has been ob&s;erved that both are the bet|ter for it; and the mo&s;t manly of the &s;i&s;ters, who keep up the neare&s;t to the brothers in their laborious exerci&s;es or em|ployments, are generally every way the &s;uperior characters.</P>
<P>Men who are &s;ubject to the mean jea|lou&s;y or fear of female learning or accom|pli&s;hments, in&s;tead of making u&s;e of them, are certainly not the fitte&s;t to dictate in this matter. Nor do we find tho&s;e who pretend to be &s;o highly di&s;gu&s;ted with learned or ma&s;culine women, to be the mo&s;t manly or learned of men. That little jea|lou&s;y or di&s;like we may rather con&s;ider as an indication of &s;ome meanne&s;s, fal&s;e delicacy, or other deficiency of character or educa|tion. We had much better improve and make u&s;e of their talents, and we &s;hould then find them of infinite u&s;e to us in many &s;ubjects. When we act the legal tyrants, and frame laws, regulations, and opinions, that concern both &s;exes, we ought certainly to con&s;ult the other, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="334" REF="345">
when they become capable and wor|thy of being con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>We Engli&s;h, I fear, were the farthe&s;t &s;poiled, and were becoming quite &s;ingular, in the&s;e feminine ideas of delicacy; we were growing really ridiculous, till &s;ome ladies of rank and good &s;en&s;e, I am happy to &s;ee, are bringing again into fa&s;hion to be manly and unaffected. Some of your little &s;narling authors, too, pretended to join the cry, and to dictate their little national prejudices for the government of the fe|male world: but I hope your ladies will have courage enough to go on to be as manly or learned as they plea&s;e; they will have the men of &s;en&s;e, and the laugh, on their &s;ide, again&s;t the fribbles and triflers, who are, to be &s;ure, as yet by far too nu|merous among you, and who are not yet a&s;hamed to mi&s;call your manly and re&s;o|lute women by the opprobrious names of ma&s;culine creatures, hor&s;e god-mothers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>While in this di&s;po&s;ition, which you may think too French and too favourable
<PB N="335" REF="346">
to the female part of the &s;pecies, I am in|clined to believe it highly probable that the greate&s;t perfection of which &s;ociety is ca|pable, may depend greatly on this approxi|mating equality of the &s;exes,&mdash;on our ac|cumulated talents and joint endeavours being applied to mo&s;t of the &s;tudies and occupations in life, and thereby all the powers of both being brought into u&s;e.</P>
<P>All the countries I have &s;een have helped to confirm me in the&s;e opinions,&mdash;tho&s;e where men and women are the mo&s;t &s;epa|rated, as well as tho&s;e where they live mo&s;t together; and I think the advances and ci|vilization of the &s;pecies may every where be mea&s;ured by the degrees of general in|timacy and intercour&s;e of the &s;exes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XVIII.</HI> Education.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE ideas of women, into which I have been led by you, and the manly agreeable females of this country, have induced me to think and inquire about education, which al&s;o appears to me here, I think, in &s;ome new points of view. The &s;chool education in France is &s;eldom, I fancy, preferable to our own, and often wor&s;e, though that of the world may be better with them. Their &s;eminaries and colleges are &s;till &s;o over-loaded with &s;uper|&s;titious ceremonies, as to impede the pro|gre&s;s in u&s;eful knowledge, and to terrify rea&s;on out of her way. However, &s;ociety and conver&s;ation afterwards make &s;ome amends for tho&s;e early errors and deficien|cies; and though this occa&s;ions a lo&s;s, at lea&s;t of time, it &s;erves to &s;hew the advan|tages
<PB N="337" REF="348">
of educating more by conver&s;e and practice than by books, and the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, if we were to apply the minds of youth rather more to practical and u&s;e|ful objects, than to books and &s;peculative &s;y&s;tems. This was the manner of the ancients, and we may regret that it is not yet more practi&s;ed among us.</P>
<P>Your national predilection in favour of too frequent a &s;eparation of the &s;exes, even in their earlie&s;t in&s;tructions, with other &s;imilar ideas of fal&s;e delicacy, I begin here to con&s;ider as the produce and the bane of mi&s;taken civilization, and as impediments to a right education of both &s;exes. Unle&s;s &s;ome wi&s;e legi&s;lature, or &s;ome female good &s;en&s;e, come in time to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I fear you may go &s;till farther into the errors and extremes of a refine|ment which knows no bounds, and which has a tendency to increa&s;e that &s;eparation of the &s;exes, perhaps at length to an A&s;iatic degree. If the&s;e ideas &s;hould extend, the con&s;equences would be ruinous to Europe. Among the lea&s;t pernicious of them would probably be that of be&s;towing a &s;till greater proportion of pains on what
<PB N="338" REF="349">
is called the minds of youth, to the utter neglect of many graceful and manly exer|ci&s;es, u&s;eful and ornamental abilities, which u&s;ed to be acquired with a view to plea&s;e each other. Their heads would then be more unmercifully &s;tuffed with theories and &s;peculations, without practice or ap|plication to any thing u&s;eful; and their hearts, or moral part, would then be left to chance, and to the company of their own &s;ex, with full liberty to make very great &s;avages of one another.</P>
<P>In your higher ranks, I fear it is often from not having been taught any u&s;eful knowledge in their youth, that we have &s;een &s;o many country gentlemen, and others, neglect the &s;tudies of their early years, becau&s;e they furni&s;h neither amu&s;e|ment nor utility in the common affairs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their lives.

<PB N="339" REF="350">
&s;o much more poli&s;hed, civilized, and conver&s;ible, than your free-born Engli&s;h|men.</P>
<P>In your happy government, where no one is confined to the rank in which he was born, a free &s;cope is given to the genius and indu&s;try of all, to better their condition, and proportionally to ri&s;e in im|portance; you, therefore, owe to each, an education equal at lea&s;t to his intended rank and condition, and perhaps to that of the next above him: for numbers among you are daily ri&s;ing, by their wealth, into &s;tations and offices in life for which they are found to be totally unprepared and unfit, and are thereby wor&s;e than lo&s;t to the community. This may be a cau&s;e of more people appear|ing to be mi&s;placed, <HI>chez vous,</HI> in office or dignity, than in countries where merit is not &s;o profe&s;&s;edly attended to. Occa&s;ions may ari&s;e with people in office &s;o very im|properly placed, as to be the ruin of the nation. If it is meant to keep the people ignorant from policy, I am pretty &s;ure it is fal&s;e policy, and <HI>tout calcul fait,</HI> you will
<PB N="340" REF="351">
find that the want of education is a lo&s;s of power, and a great hindrance to the ad|vances of a nation in all the arts, be&s;ides the injury done to morals, manners, and civilization. We have never found the Scotch to be wor&s;e, but certainly better qualified for mo&s;t things, for having &s;o generally received &s;ome education in their youth: their common people are therefore more temperate, frugal, and better be|haved,&mdash;confe&s;&s;edly of a moral character &s;uperior to the people of the &s;outhern and richer provinces. This is well known both in the land and &s;ea &s;ervice.</P>
<P>By good education, I mean virtuous habits and u&s;eful knowledge, at lea&s;t that is the be&s;t general definition that I can think of at pre&s;ent. No rank in &s;ociety &s;hould remain without &s;ome &s;hare of the&s;e, &s;uch as is &s;uited to their condition. Why &s;hould not even the lowe&s;t ranks learn writing, and &s;ome of the u&s;es of numbers, and many of them &s;ome geometry and mechanics in a practical way? By the la|bour of learning the&s;e,&mdash;by the very act
<PB N="341" REF="352">
of going regularly to &s;chool, together with &s;ome proper and practical moral in&s;truction there; we know that excellent effects may be produced, and that the important habits of regularity and application, obedience and oeconomy, may in this way be given to the people, in &s;hort, a moral character &s;uperior to that of your pre&s;ent lower cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>There are not probably any where &s;o many liberal and public-&s;pirited gentlemen as in your i&s;land; and yet I fear, through|out the country, the &s;upply is not equal to the demand; and in mo&s;t public depart|ments, there is too obvious a want of u&s;eful and &s;cientific knowledge, as well as among your trade&s;men and country &s;quires, which is indeed becoming almo&s;t proverbial, now that you are, it is hoped, cea&s;ing to de&s;erve the imputation.</P>

<P>I think I have ob&s;erved, that the kind of knowledge in which the people, and even the gentlemen throughout England, are the mo&s;t deficient, is the mathematical,&mdash;&s;till more than in either the natural or moral kinds: many of them &s;eem to acquire &s;ome tolerable notions of agriculture, of law and government, of commerce; but in mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects where mathematics are concerned; as, canals, roads, rivers, &s;ea-ports, embankings, piers, harbours, mines,

Since they have conde&s;cended to &s;tudy our laws, may not we hope that a knowledge of commerce and manufactures, of experi|mental philo&s;ophy and chemi&s;try, may be gradually introduced there? the mathema|tical and mechanical &s;ciences directed to|wards practice and utility; together with &s;ome ta&s;te and practice in the fine arts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is with plea&s;ure we ob&s;erve, that &s;ince, and even before, the above was written, our univer&s;ities have adopted many of the&s;e improvements, e&s;pecially Cambridge; and it is hoped they will go on improving: there is no &s;tationary degree of perfection for any thing in this world.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIX.</HI> Of Language.&mdash;Of the French,&mdash;its Influ|ence.&mdash;Of Mu&s;ical Language.</HEAD>
<P>I LIKE the idea which you mention, of &s;ome late writers judging of the civili|zation of a people by their language, and from a vocabulary of its terms determining their advances in arts and knowledge. I have thought we could likewi&s;e judge of their ta&s;te by &s;imilar means, and from the choice and compo&s;ition of the &s;ounds in which they have cho&s;en to expre&s;s them|&s;elves, we might gue&s;s at their talents, and their ta&s;te in general, and more particularly in language, in mu&s;ic, and in all the objects of hearing; for the&s;e are all curiou&s;ly, though often almo&s;t imperceptibly, linked to each other, and form but one con|nected chain of kindred powers and per|ceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="358">From this I am inclined to think, that they mu&s;t have had a fine ta&s;te, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, or <HI>tatto fino e forte,</HI> who framed the Italian language; and tho&s;e who formed the French, a very bad one&mdash;a kind of fal&s;e delicacy which led them to prefer &s;uch combinations of &s;ounds and ar|ticulations, as are contrary to the real principles and mechanical means of full and fine expre&s;&s;ion, and as tend to form &s;uch po&s;itions and habits of the organs as con|tract and debilitate them, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing and fortifying their exertions. The organs of &s;peaking and of hearing, being connected by nature, are, I think, both &s;poiled by the French language: from this habitual fal&s;e &s;tandard proceeds a depraved ta&s;te, which prevents their judging rightly of eloquence, poetry, mu&s;ic, and of all tho&s;e &s;pecies of beauties, and in &s;hort, of all the objects of the&s;e two faculties at lea&s;t: accordingly, I think we actually find that the French people are the mo&s;t deficient of any nation we know, in learning to &s;peak other languages; and we may therefore pre&s;ume that they cannot properly judge
<PB N="348" REF="359">
of their beauties or defects. Thus, in one leading error or defect, we often di&s;cover the fertile &s;ource of many more: and, be|&s;ides the natural connection of the powers and objects of ta&s;te, the arts, we know, cannot well advance but a-brea&s;t, if you will excu&s;e a military term: &s;o that it is difficult to conceive, how tho&s;e who have gone originally wrong in &s;everal of them, can be great in any: and if we take into the account, a deficiency of perception in &s;ome of the finer and &s;imple beauties of nature, the &s;ource of all the re&s;t; and if we thence deduce their pa&s;&s;ion for the artifi|cial kinds,&mdash;for things where the labour and the arti&s;t appear,&mdash;for gla&s;s, gilding, glitter, &mdash;for violent and &s;uperfluous colouring and carving; we mu&s;t allow them merit for not going farther wrong: and we cannot help regretting, that they have &s;o much to over|come before they can begin to make a right progre&s;s. We know, however, that &s;ome of this nation have overcome almo&s;t all of tho&s;e difficulties and impediments, which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have co&s;t them great pains, trouble, and travel: I have known &s;everal
<PB N="349" REF="360">
who have be&s;towed great labour on the pronunciation and &s;peaking of other lan|guages, and with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than you can well imagine.</P>
<P>You will readily conceive, that in &s;peak|ing of national character, one means only that which is mo&s;t commonly to be met with in that nation, and which is always &s;ubject to numerous exceptions. We are, perhaps, too ready to rea&s;on on general ideas, and lay down principles in almo&s;t every &s;ubject, and thence go often wrong by rule. We all know, as you ob&s;erve, that there have been many men and wo|men al&s;o of this country, who have &s;hewn the mo&s;t elegant and cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te in many things, and &s;ome who have excelled in al|mo&s;t all the arts,&mdash;if we except tho&s;e in which, from being in&s;en&s;ibly incapacitated by their native language, they are infallibly de&s;tined to labour in vain; and this defici|ency reaches farther than you may at fir&s;t conceive;&mdash;&s;o far as to &s;urpri&s;e you when you come to examine it.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="361">In many ways the French &s;hew great vi|vacity and quickne&s;s of parts, and &s;ome|times even &s;hining abilities, although their &s;tyle of performance in all the arts may be faulty: their amateurs in mu&s;ic, for ex|ample, are generally greater performers than ours, though their &s;tyle and manner of playing is yet more vicious: their vio|lent and &s;udden jerks and tran&s;itions,&mdash;tho&s;e extremes of forte and piano which are no longer mu&s;ical &s;ounds, the one being only a whi&s;per, and the other a noi&s;e;&mdash;their inattention to tone, and hence the general badne&s;s of their in&s;truments, and &s;till more their voices;&mdash;their ri&s;ing and &s;ink|ing &s;o far, and &s;o &s;uddenly, from all the fury of pa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ilence of death or &s;tupidity: the&s;e are certainly not within the line of beauty. Our ta&s;te and execution tend towards the other extreme of the tame, heavy, and in&s;ipid. Of the two extremes, I &s;hould perhaps prefer their fire and &s;pirit, with all its vicious violence, to our &s;leepy though &s;entimental languor, could they but keep their violence within any bounds: but it &s;eems in this ca&s;e, as if it were ea&s;ier for
<PB N="351" REF="362">
us to add than for them to take away, and better to fall &s;hort than over&s;hoot the mark. By attending more to the Italians, our per|formers, though le&s;s numerous and le&s;s powerful, certainly do improve in ta&s;te, while they continue in the &s;ame wild ex|treme; and when you are not deficient in &s;pirit and expre&s;&s;ion, you are probably now getting before them in the chief re|qui&s;ites of in&s;trumental performance, though &s;till inferior in force and execution; nor are you yet &s;o far &s;uperior to them in &s;ing|ing as you &s;eem to fancy; and I think you are not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of your nume|rous vocal deficiencies, nor of many other attendant national vulgari&s;ms; and con&s;e|quently, you are not in the way to get rid of them.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t opinions, except perhaps our own, both the French and we are certainly wretched &s;ingers, and below critici&s;m: let us then attend to the Italians. If we might ven|ture to critici&s;e their productions, we might ob&s;erve that even they &s;ometimes go a little a&s;tray: from a fertile fancy, and love of
<PB N="353" REF="363">
novelty, amid&s;t their endeavours to plea&s;e all parties and all nations, we may expect to find them, at times, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing their own maxims, and &s;acrificing a principle to an acce&s;&s;ory,&mdash;real beauty to trifling orna|ment; and in compliance to the times, pre|ferring the caprices of execution to the e&s;|&s;entials of expre&s;&s;ion; running into a &s;tyle which a Roman audience will call <HI>troppo trito et ornato.</HI> And till &s;ome other Meta|&s;ta&s;io appear, their little poeta&s;ters may often be wrong in their mu&s;ical language, and may not always di&s;tingui&s;h between what &s;hould be &s;aid and what &s;hould be &s;ung,&mdash;between the words fit for <HI>aria,</HI> and tho&s;e for <HI>recitativo;</HI> though the&s;e, with their affections of the mind, are as different as &s;moke and flame; and the change from one to the other &s;omewhat re&s;embling that tran&s;ition of nature, as far as &s;uch different objects can re&s;emble. The attempts of the French to run the&s;e gradually into each other, like &s;everal of their refined ab|&s;urdities, only &s;erves to &s;hew their want of mu&s;ical feeling and judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="364">Gracing recitative appears ab&s;urd, and yet in the fir&s;t operas, it &s;eems, it was &s;till more ornamented, and had frequent formal clo&s;es: that &s;tyle &s;eems to be returning. But we may tru&s;t the Italians to their own feelings, which will not probably &s;uffer them to wander far, nor long, from truth and nature: and we mu&s;t leave the French to go wrong their own way, which they will mo&s;t likely always do.</P>
<P>This of mu&s;ical language is a &s;ubject that would require &s;ome farther critical at|tention, if that attention could be of any &s;ervice to it. Since the time of the Greeks, I think it has been attended to only by the Italians, and by them ra|ther felt than under&s;tood; it may cea&s;e to be &s;o, like many other things, when we come to analy&s;e it. As the age of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and great actions is antecedent to that of rea&s;on and &s;cientific re&s;earches, the greate&s;t things are performed before we know well how, or can trace the rules or motives; and when we come to examine too clo&s;ely into the cau&s;es of our plea&s;ure, I fear it often vani&s;hes in the inve&s;tigation.
<PB N="354" REF="365">
Mu&s;ic was probably more felt when le&s;s &s;cientific and refined. We have been very long in di&s;covering that we have no mu&s;ical language except the Italian, and that is only partly mu&s;ical: hence the world is not yet cured of the vulgar notion, that any words may be &s;ung, if they are only made to rhyme: whereas, it is certainly fir&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment expre&s;&s;ed, and not the rhyme nor cadence, that renders &s;erious words fit to be &s;ung; then the con&s;truction and arrangement of the &s;ounds and articula|tions of tho&s;e words, become next of con|&s;equence in mu&s;ical language. I fear it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to produce the proper and powerful voice of pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment upon any of that numerous cla&s;s of Engli&s;h words ending with a dead dumb con&s;onant. We could as ea&s;ily run full &s;peed again&s;t a wall.</P>
<P>It may be chiefly owing to this forma|tion of our language, and to the difficulty of producing and exerci&s;ing the voice in &s;inging it, that we have had &s;o few good voices, &s;o little vocal expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o
<PB N="355" REF="366">
defective a ta&s;te, or feeling, of mu&s;ic in general: and now that we begin to be a little improved by the Italians, our judg|ment is &s;till variable and un&s;ure; in de|liberating whether we &s;hould follow them or not, we are left behind, and often keep admiring as new what is out of date, and far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in other countries. In like manner, the defects of voice, ta&s;te, and manner, &s;o con&s;picuous in this nation, might be deduced from their language, though in a different way, as its mu&s;ical deficiencies are different. But I wi&s;h not to tire you with di&s;qui&s;itions which, with|out &s;uch minutiae, you may probably think too long before I have done. For the language and the mu&s;ic of this country, you &s;ee, are leading me into a multitude of general reflections on the&s;e two &s;ubjects: from them I &s;hall go on to pick out what may appear to me the mo&s;t new and im|portant, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual travelling par|ticulars concerning a country already &s;o well known.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XX.</HI> Of &s;peaking Languages.&mdash;Of Style.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ingularity of &s;ome of the&s;e opinions, on the French, on languages, on mu&s;ic, and doubt|ful of my own judgment, yet, on the ma|ture&s;t deliberation, I do not find that I can abate much even of the mo&s;t &s;ingular: we may be too cautious, and thereby de&s;troy all energy of thought, and I am perhaps too apt to doubt from anxiety not to mi&s;re|pre&s;ent; but owing to that very anxiety &s;ome degree of mi&s;repre&s;entation is perhaps unavoidable: from a &s;olicitude to give a &s;trik|ing likene&s;s, we cannot always avoid over|charging &s;ome of the features.</P>
<P>I have here been labouring hard to &s;peak the French <HI>comme il faut,</HI> afraid that &s;ome prejudice or di&s;like might ari&s;e in me from a want of &s;ufficient practice and intercour&s;e, which I believe may often
<PB N="357" REF="368">
happen: we find the people of mo&s;t coun|tries become more agreeable to us as we grow into their friend&s;hip and acquaint|ance. But I doubt being ever able now to pronounce and &s;peak the French with the current volubility of a native, unle&s;s it be on &s;ome cho&s;en and premeditated &s;ubjects. I have had the &s;atisfaction of being taken for an Italian in Italy, and for a Spaniard in Spain (a very rare thing for a &s;tranger), but I &s;uppo&s;e I may never be able to pa&s;s here for more than a Swi&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;peaking languages well depends not quite &s;o much, I think, on a par|ticular turn or genius for it, as many &s;uppo&s;e, but more on early pains and habits; and in adults, on additional labour and &s;tudy, and on ob&s;erving narrowly, both by the eye and the ear, the motion, man|ner, and po&s;ture of the mouths of the na|tives: much will likewi&s;e depend on the nature of our own original language, as before ob&s;erved, on the po&s;ition and &s;trength it may previou&s;ly have given to certain organs: &s;o that we find &s;ome nations learn
<PB N="358" REF="369">
languages much ea&s;ier than others,&mdash;as the Iri&s;h, Scotch, Moors, &amp;c.&mdash;the French and Engli&s;h the wor&s;t of all. The French are certainly the mo&s;t confined and capricious of us all in their alphabetical habits and ideas, in their notions of orthography, and I believe in every thing where &s;ounds are concerned: you know, in geography, they have totally &s;poiled the names of places, <HI>que no les conociera la madre que les pari&ograve;:</HI> for the&s;e and many other rea&s;ons, it is much to be lamented that their language &s;hould take the lead in Europe.</P>
<P>I think I can perceive &s;ome powerful ef|fects of language on the phy&s;iognomy, and can thence trace one of the cau&s;es of nationality of face: this might be a curious &s;peculation to pur&s;ue; but I know not how it could be well expre&s;&s;ed in writing. You mu&s;t not yet tire of the&s;e digre&s;&s;ive and de&s;ultory lectures, which you get &s;o often in&s;tead of travels; I &s;hall perhaps return again and again to the &s;ame &s;ubjects, as they may, in pa&s;&s;ing through different countries, be forced on the mind: this of
<PB N="359" REF="370">
language and &s;ounds &s;eems to run into a &s;tring of reflections which might be &s;tretch|ed to any length, e&s;pecially if we extend it &s;o as to take in mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I think I under&s;tand and like your ob|&s;ervations on Blair and on &s;tyle, but I ap|prehend that, in communicating our ideas, we &s;hall di&s;cover between us &s;ome differ|ences in ta&s;te, as u&s;ual with tho&s;e who ven|ture to think for them&s;elves. Accu&s;tomed to read for information more than for plea|&s;ure, I have attended little to &s;tyle or man|ner, and have therefore, perhaps, inade|quate ideas of its beauties and importance: certainly to handle the tools, and feel the difficulties of an art, mu&s;t enable us to judge better of the merits of the perform|ance, provided we are always aware of the error of e&s;timating the difficulties of execution too highly; an error to which profe&s;&s;ors have been &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes &s;ubject. Some ob&s;ervations, however, have occurred to me on attending to yours; you will tell me if you think them ju&s;t: our opinions may be of more &s;ervice to
<PB N="360" REF="371">
each other for the very rea&s;on that they differ.</P>
<P>If we Engli&s;h &s;hould be led into a ta&s;te for too much ornament in writing or &s;peak|ing, I think we &s;hould have le&s;s excu&s;e for our&s;elves than &s;ome other nations. Our plain, rational, and mono&s;yllabic tongue, &s;eems to me, neither made for mu&s;ic, nor for tho&s;e flowery and &s;onorous beauties which, in &s;ome other languages, charm and run away with us by the ear. Our lan|guage, clear, di&s;tinct, and preci&s;e, &s;peaks only to the under&s;tanding; it cares not much about the beauties of &s;ound, nor waits to attend to them. In attempting a lengthened latinity of phra&s;e, or a con&s;tant rounding of periods with mea&s;ured &s;ets of &s;onorous terms, in &s;oaring to magnificence and amplification, we pre&s;ently get into the regions of affectation, where we are quite out of our element, and make a very awk|ward figure. In the &s;hort nervous &s;tyle, where powerful brevity prevails, I con|ceive that both the beauties and expre&s;&s;ion of our language con&s;i&s;t: content with the
<PB N="361" REF="372">
few graces that lie in its way, and not deigning to look a&s;ide for the flowery paths that lead round, by tedious and uncertain ways, to the object already in view, it goes beyond mo&s;t other languages in force and rapidity; reaches its object &s;ooner, and &s;trikes it more forcibly. If, in aiming at brevity, we &s;ometimes appear abrupt and ob&s;cure, it is more excu&s;able than the other extreme of the flowery, declamatory, or diffu&s;e.</P>
<P>Every language has its particular turn or genius. I know not if any one has re|marked the&s;e, or the following particulars, of ours: in the pronunciation, it &s;eems to incline to a certain di&s;tinct pau&s;ing pre|ci&s;ion, by its &s;trong and frequent articula|tions, as if attending only to per&s;picuity or demon&s;tration; and without a particular at|tention to a choice of words, mo&s;tly of foreign extraction, it does not run current|ly, or with facility, through the mouth: but when that attention is di&s;covered, it &s;trikes with an idea of affectation, again&s;t every &s;pecies of which I think we have,
<PB N="362" REF="373">
after a certain degree of cultivation, a na|tural di&s;like more than any other nation I know. Whereas, in the Spani&s;h and Italian languages, the voice dwells with plea&s;ure on mo&s;t of their &s;ounds, and the tongue re|bounds upon every articulation with a ra|pidity and ela&s;ticity which exerci&s;es and &s;trengthens its powers: but of this, unfor|tunately, very few of our Engli&s;h or French mouths can ever be &s;en&s;ible, as both our languages and our organs have been over-refined, contracted, and debilitated,&mdash;pro|bably from the &s;illy affectation of people with bad ears, and fal&s;e ta&s;te, trying to &s;peak pretty. I mu&s;t think that mo&s;t of our flowery writers and &s;peakers will offend the nice and natural ear much more by their affectation, than they can ever plea&s;e it by all the beauties they can thus exhibit: while our plain and &s;imple brevity, &mdash;our wit and humour,&mdash;our &s;imple and truly &s;ublime, which ri&s;es by &s;tealth into &s;entiment independent of the wings of &s;ound, and where more is meant than meets the ear; the&s;e will always be ju&s;tly admired: as we ri&s;e into the florid, we
<PB N="363" REF="374">
&s;oon become ridiculous; &s;acrificing &s;en&s;e to &s;ound in a wa&s;te of ineffectual ornaments.</P>
<P>You ought to be the Spartans of Europe, &mdash;the patterns of a manly and laconic &s;tyle of eloquence; and if you would but <HI>tant &s;oit peu,</HI> &s;upport that character, the &s;ur|rounding nations are rather inclined to grant it you: you would then &s;tand high and alone; but if you mi&s;take your object, and take the contrary road, through a flowery verbo&s;ity, you will find all the higher places occupied; you will be out-done in tho&s;e walks by many, who will look down upon you as weak competitors, and laugh at the unnatural efforts of &s;uch awkward imitators.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion of our language nece&s;&s;a|rily depends more on empha&s;is than on ac|cent, of which la&s;t we have now no rule or idea that can be mea&s;ured or applied, and of which we therefore wi&s;ely make a very moderate and arbitrary u&s;e; and the em|pha&s;is, when carried to a vulgar extreme, offends the ear, and &s;wallows up the
<PB N="364" REF="375">
unemphatic parts. Much of Garrick's merit as a &s;peaker, con&s;i&s;ted in properly moderating and concealing it, as the be&s;t French players do with that barbarous in|vention of rhyme; he turned empha&s;is into &s;ound. From this might likewi&s;e, perhaps, be deduced much of our fal&s;e ta&s;te in &s;ing|ing, and thence generally in mu&s;ic; for Engli&s;h &s;inging is as much too emphatic as the &s;peaking. By carrying this violent de|gree of empha&s;is into &s;ong, we &s;upport the fal&s;e idea, of mu&s;ic or &s;inging being an ex|aggerated kind of &s;peech or poetry; and tho&s;e emphatic parts of our &s;ongs, and &s;till more of our boi&s;terous and bellowing choru&s;es, often cover and conceal all the re&s;t, and come to our ears, not in the &s;hape of &s;ounds, but as blows &s;ufficient to &s;plit our heads.</P>
<P>Our pronunciation has been &s;o over-re|fined by fal&s;e delicacy and affectation, that we have probably now lo&s;t much of the reli&s;h for that brief and expre&s;&s;ive energy which is the <HI>fort</HI> of our language. We have bani&s;hed the powerful guttural &s;ounds
<PB N="365" REF="376">
which, in the Spani&s;h, and &s;ome other lan|guages, &s;eem to double the force and ex|tent of the organs of &s;peech: the nations of mo&s;t ta&s;te and feeling have retained tho&s;e &s;ounds; as the Arabians, the Spani&s;h, the Scotch, Tu&s;cans, &amp;c.: a third &s;pecies of arti|culation, and the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, is thus added to the other two: tho&s;e three &s;pecies are the labial, the palatal, and the guttural. The <HI>r</HI> &s;eems likewi&s;e to be in &s;ome danger of lo&s;ing its force and powers in the over|refined and minced mode of &s;peaking, of fa&s;hion and affectation.</P>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee you affect and approve of brevity and &s;implicity; I think them e&s;&s;ential in your poetry and the true &s;ublime, and indi&s;pen&s;able in our language. Study and acquire a facility of &s;tyle and compo&s;i|tion by all means, but not the art of &s;pinning out a little matter into a long &s;tory, or a great book; that is beneath the dignity of a language who&s;e force con&s;i&s;ts in its good &s;en&s;e and preci&s;ion: your words &s;hould be all weight and &s;ub&s;tance,&mdash;full mea&s;ure pre&s;&s;ed together, and running over, in a redundancy

of &s;en&s;e, but not of &s;ound: examples enough might be found to prove this doc|trine. In your favourite Gibbon, I think you will find his be&s;t phra&s;es are the brief and laconic,&mdash;tho&s;e that are mo&s;t like Ta|citus; but I &s;u&s;pect that the long and la|boured periods, of which he is probably the proude&s;t, will lea&s;t &s;tand the te&s;t of time and good ta&s;te. The mo&s;t powerful parts of Lord Chatham's eloquence were tho&s;e compre&s;&s;ed into the very e&s;&s;ence of brevity; when he &s;aid, <Q>I rejoice that America re&s;i&s;ts,</Q> what a previous march and energy of thought was there expre&s;&s;ed! We can a&s;toni&s;h by the &s;hort and forcible ways of hitting our object, but not by over|whelming it in a torrent of words, unle&s;s it be by the &s;uddenne&s;s and velocity, more than by the quantity, of that torrent; but even there, beware of fal&s;e fire and fal&s;e torrents. I know of but few, be&s;ides your Dean Swift, who have had ta&s;te enough to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e tin&s;el beauties of conceit and affectation in our language.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="378">Let us not be led too far out of our way neither by the fal&s;e glare of tho&s;e fanciful fellows the poets:&mdash;but I can excu&s;e you young men being a little caught, at fir&s;t, by the tin&s;el of our flouri&s;hers and ver&s;i|fiers; it is a fire that will cool by time and a maturer refinement. I think we have hardly had a poet, &s;ince Shake&s;pear and Milton, of a mind &s;ufficiently univer&s;al; nor a &s;peaker of real ta&s;te, except Garrick, to &s;hew us how much we &s;hould attend to &s;en&s;e, and how much to &s;ound: I believe, we &s;hall &s;eldom find any of tho&s;e three &s;a|crificing the former to the latter. We mu&s;t not look for the force nor for the few beau|ties of our language, in the &s;ickly fancy of modern refinement, that culls the few &s;oft and affected phra&s;es, and &s;hrinks from the old, rough, manly, and mo&s;t powerful terms,&mdash;nor in the fa&s;hionable conver&s;ation, or mincing jargon of the day, among the people who are reputed <HI>genteel.</HI> I think I have known &s;ome country, or pa&s;toral, people, who have a better ta&s;te in poetry, mu&s;ic, and &s;ong, than tho&s;e of great towns; there, I think the vulgarities are in&s;upport|able;

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXI.</HI> On Mu&s;ic.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mrs. P&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now going to take your advice, and try to recollect &s;uch of my ob&s;erva|tions on mu&s;ic as may have a chance of being new or &s;ingular, and in the order they may occur to a memory which you know to be none of the be&s;t. The va&s;t variety of &s;ounds, their formation, quali|ties, and effects, &s;eem not to have been yet &s;ufficiently attended to, perhaps be|cau&s;e not of &s;ufficient importance. But you &s;ee I know not well how, or where, to begin, without appearing too general and &s;y&s;tematic; and I do not mean to write a formal treati&s;e: we men are ever attempt|ing to generalize ideas too much, and em|broiling with &s;cientific ratiocination the &s;imple&s;t things. Some Frenchman ob|&s;erves, <HI>"que trop de rai&s;onnement &eacute;touffe le &s;entiment; il faudroit le lai&s;&s;er a ceux qui ne
<PB N="370" REF="381">
&s;ont des hommes que par la t&eacute;te."</HI> You ladies could give us very good le&s;&s;ons in the&s;e matters; with a little more education, many of you would render learning more agreeable and le&s;s pedantic, and would be &s;ufficiently compre&s;&s;ed and laconic in your rea&s;oning, with all the advantages of a finer ta&s;te and a truer &s;en&s;ibility, a ju&s;ter &s;en&s;e of &s;implicity, affectation, and of all the human qualities, you might be &s;till of more &s;ervice to us.</P>
<P>But I meant to &s;ay &s;omething more of the &s;ounds, or component parts of lan|guage: I think they have not yet been well arranged, nor under&s;tood; I doubt that which was under&s;tood by the Greeks is now mo&s;tly lo&s;t to us. Some of the Italian grammarians and mu&s;icians, as a Buomat|tei, Martini, Tartini, &amp;c. have made another beginning on the&s;e &s;ubjects of &s;ounds, language, mu&s;ic; and the Italians are mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in pur&s;uing them.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="382">Alphabetical writing was doubtle&s;s a wonderful and important di&s;covery. Its greate&s;t merit, I think, was that of di&s;|tingui&s;hing &s;ounds from articulations, a degree of perfection to which the ea&s;tern languages have not yet arrived; and that defect may be, with tho&s;e nations, one of the chief cau&s;es of their limited progre&s;s in many other things. You know they have no vowels, except &s;ome that have the <HI>a,</HI> but always joined to &s;ome articulation: their attempts to &s;upply that defect by points, give them but very imperfect and indi&s;tinct ideas of vocal and articulate &s;ounds, and of their important di&s;tinction. But even languages the mo&s;t alphabetical, if the ex|pre&s;&s;ion may be allowed, could not pro|bably tran&s;mit, by writing, a complete idea of their own &s;ounds and pronunciation from any one age or people to another. Sounds are to us infinite and variable, and we cannot tran&s;mit by one &s;en&s;e the ideas and objects of another. We &s;hall be convinced of this, when we recollect the innumerable qualities of tone in human voices, &s;o as to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h all
<PB N="372" REF="383">
our acquaintances, though the number &s;hould amount to many hundreds, or per|haps thou&s;ands. With attention, we might di&s;cover a different quality of tone in every in&s;trument; for all the&s;e there never can be a &s;ufficient number of adequate terms in in any written language: and when that variety comes to be compounded with a like variety of articulation, it becomes in|finite to us. The varieties only upon the &s;even notes in mu&s;ic, varied only as to pitch and modulation throughout the audible &s;cale, combined with tho&s;e of time, are not yet probably half exhau&s;ted by the con&s;tant labour of &s;o many ages. So that the idea of Mr. Steel, and others, of repre&s;enting to the eye the tune and time only of the &s;ounds in any language, will probably ever prove inadequate to the end propo&s;ed, even without attempting the kinds and qualities of tones and articulations, which would render it infinite and quite impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the &s;ounds of language into <HI>accent, quantity, empha&s;is,</HI> has plainly proved in&s;ufficient to mark or mea&s;ure
<PB N="373" REF="384">
tho&s;e ideas intelligibly. Some mode of dividing all &s;ounds, comprehending tho&s;e of language, into <HI>tune, time, tone,</HI> and <HI>ar|ticulation,</HI> &s;eems po&s;&s;ible: and &s;ome of them might be expre&s;&s;ed on an in&s;trument, but not the whole. Empha&s;is &s;eems in|capable of being mea&s;ured or tran&s;mitted. Noi&s;e and &s;ound &s;eem to belong to different genera. So that there appears to be a real di&s;tinction between <HI>noi&s;e, &s;ound,</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ic;</HI> and though the&s;e three di&s;tinct genera decline, or &s;hade off into each other, yet they cannot well be confounded by a ju&s;t or mu&s;ical ear; but it &s;eems to me, that in France and England they often con|found them all.</P>
<P>The complete generic difference between &s;ome &s;ounds and mu&s;ic, as between &s;inging and &s;peaking, has certainly been overlook|ed: the&s;e two &s;pecies of <HI>voci</HI> &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed by different terms: words, when &s;ung, &s;hould be called by &s;ome other name. It &s;eems doubtful if &s;peaking in the modern languages can belong even to the cla&s;s of &s;ounds, much le&s;s to that of mu&s;ic. The idea and expre&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ical beauties
<PB N="374" REF="385">
in language, is now merely figurative: we might almo&s;t as properly call them white or black, as mu&s;ical. The moment any noi&s;e becomes a &s;ound, or a &s;ound becomes mu&s;ical, it is transformed in its nature, and into a different cla&s;s, and &s;hould no longer retain the &s;ame name: and if we had terms enough, none of tho&s;e techni|cally u&s;ed for one cla&s;s would apply to another. Nothing &s;hews more clearly the in&s;ufficiency of language, than different &s;ubjects borrowing &s;o many terms from each other: it may be the &s;ource of &s;ome figures and beauties of &s;peech, but not of preci&s;ion or of &s;cientific improvement. I only pretend to give hints: terms and ar|rangements &s;eem yet wanting in the&s;e &s;ub|jects. The Italians &s;hould here inve&s;tigate, and we &s;hould follow them.</P>
<P>In order to under&s;tand this generic differ|ence between mu&s;ical &s;ounds and all others, we mu&s;t attend to the mind, when mu&s;ically employed or di&s;po&s;ed by mu&s;ic it&s;elf: in that di&s;po&s;ition or affection, the chief circum|&s;tance to be noticed &s;eems to be the power
<PB N="375" REF="386">
given to the mind, by means of mu&s;ic, at once to dwell on the object of its pa&s;&s;ion, and to expre&s;s that pa&s;&s;ion with ea&s;e and plea|&s;ure by means of this new medium: where|as, by words, or common language, the mind &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to vent or get rid of its feelings; or the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas leaves not time for the deep impre&s;&s;ion of any one in particular; hence the great pa&s;&s;ions feel a kind of contempt for mere words, and often prefer &s;ilence or action; the mind prefers mu&s;ic (if the pa&s;&s;ion is not too outrageous), in order to indulge in expre&s;&s;ions at once &s;ufficiently plea&s;ant and durable. Words, producing their ef|fects by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and reiterated impre&s;|&s;ions, but which are only tran&s;ient, and, as it were, remove each other, the re&s;ult can|not be &s;o much an accumulation of the whole, as when mu&s;ic is employed to bind all tho&s;e in&s;tants together, and, by form|ing them all into one continued whole, produce effects proportioned to the pro|longed duration of the favourite &s;enti|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="387">Between the lea&s;t and greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ion in mu&s;ic,&mdash;between &s;imple recitation and the be&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of extreme di&s;tre&s;s, of &s;orrow, rage, or de&s;pair,&mdash;the degrees are numerous, and &s;eem to me far greater than between any one kind of language and another: yet this mu&s;ical affection &s;eems likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to &s;mooth and equalize, as well as to continue the different &s;enti|ments expre&s;&s;ed, and to bring the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion down to a tone or tempera|ment more plea&s;ant and &s;upportable; and &s;eems, at the &s;ame time, to dignify or ele|vate le&s;&s;er objects and &s;entiments up to|wards the &s;ame tone, &s;o as to a&s;&s;imilate the whole of the &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ion, and render them more temperate and ele|gant, though not le&s;s powerful: hence mu&s;ic has always been con&s;idered as proper to &s;often or tame the rugged and hurtful pa&s;&s;ions,&mdash;to temper and civilize the mind; and hence it cannot probably admit of the violent oratorial or theatrical modes of action and expre&s;&s;ion: &s;obbing, and tears, may perhaps be admi&s;&s;ible in &s;ome kinds of declamation, but not in &s;erious &s;inging;
<PB N="377" REF="388" MS="y">
and the ab&s;urdity of the French in attempt|ing it, is very obvious to every body but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The meaning and limits of mu&s;ical ex|pre&s;&s;ions not being very clear, di&s;tinct, or well defined, but &s;haded off, and running, as it were, out of &s;ight, leave the fancy ju&s;t what it wi&s;hes, the power of &s;haping them to its own affections; &s;o that the mu&s;ic and the imagination go on, mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other wonderou&s;ly well, till lo&s;t in the clouds of &s;ublimity of their own creating. From the&s;e premi&s;es follow &s;everal con&s;equences, more than I &s;hall trouble you with.</P>
<P>From this equanimity and de&s;ire of con|tinuance in the mu&s;ical affection, we may deduce the di&s;like of violent change in the melody or modulation, in the time or movement, beyond a certain degree; the&s;e mu&s;t corre&s;pond to the new equanimity of the pa&s;&s;ions, and now &s;lower tran&s;itions of the mind. This is &s;eldom &s;ufficiently ob|&s;erved even by ma&s;ters of great name; I
<PB N="378" REF="389">
think they are often either under or over the limits in modulation&mdash;length, variety, change; and they thus too plainly di&s;cover that they do not always them&s;elves feel what they &s;eem to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>From hence, and from what follows, may be deduced the rea&s;ons of our language being unfit for mu&s;ic, and of its injuring our mu&s;ical abilities, and impeding the pro|gre&s;s of the art. The number of ideas, and accuracy of the meaning, the wit, and habi|tual good &s;en&s;e, of the Engli&s;h language, are all unfit to be &s;ung, e&s;pecially when compre&s;&s;ed into few words; &s;o that your be&s;t poetry is the lea&s;t &s;ingable; and there is no &s;etting two of your excellent ver&s;es to mu&s;ic, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing &s;ome of the above rules of nature: likewi&s;e, its &s;ounds and articulations not being arranged for &s;inging, the expre&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly in the force of &s;hortne&s;s, more like the &s;trength of a blow than the power of &s;ound, your poetry mu&s;t be &s;poiled by being &s;ung, and your forcible empha&s;is mu&s;t lo&s;e its powers, when turned into lengthened and enfeebled
<PB N="379" REF="390">
&s;ound, with the powers of which you are not &s;ufficiently acquainted nor exerci&s;ed, nor probably ever can be, while impeded by an antimu&s;ical language, that cannot with propriety be &s;ung. That angular kind of &s;tiffne&s;s in French and Engli&s;h &s;ong, of which almo&s;t all their compo&s;itions partake, is thus probably owing to the languages.</P>
<P>The qualities of tone, which &s;eem in|finite, have great power in carrying various affections directly to the heart: indeed, the quality of tone &s;eems to be the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the whole mu&s;ical ma|chinery that affects us, and yet it &s;eems the lea&s;t attended to by the French and Engli&s;h. Certain tones, and mu&s;ical &s;en|tences, &s;eem to be the original expre&s;&s;ions of nature, and cannot be analy&s;ed or ex|plained; and they might, perhaps, be made to &s;upply &s;till better the defects in the lan|guages of convention.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o, one air or piece &s;hould never be made to expre&s;s more than one &s;enti|ment: there is a nece&s;&s;ary unity of idea
<PB N="380" REF="391">
throughout the &s;ame movement, and to break it is as great an offence again&s;t the ta&s;te or af|fection on the one hand, as the want of ge|nius &s;ufficient to fill up the limits of variety, which the mind in that &s;tate allows, is on the other. The favourite object or &s;enti|ment of a pa&s;&s;ion is of &s;uch importance in the mu&s;ical piece, that different movements may be applied to expre&s;s it, or dwell on it: but different &s;entiments being &s;ung to the &s;ame mu&s;ic is generally ab&s;urd and in|congruous. The old mode of ballads, or poems, where the words are the main ob|ject, and every ver&s;e is &s;ung to the &s;ame tune, is poetry and not mu&s;ic; quite an|other &s;pecies, as well as that of recitative, and of many comic expre&s;&s;ions which depend on the jingle or rythmical motion of the time.</P>
<P>Some of the ballad kind of mu&s;ic, I can conceive, might, even in modern language, be &s;ucce&s;sfully applied to greater poetic works, which, accompanied by a large harp or lute, might be &s;ung or recited in &s;ome kind of half-mea&s;ured heroic air, or recita|tive, as was probably done by the ancients,
<PB N="381" REF="392">
and attempted by &s;ome modern harpers or min&s;trels in various countries; and of which the pre&s;ent old Spani&s;h romance may be &s;ome remains or imitation. A great ma&s;ter of his in&s;trument, and of his &s;ub|ject, I can likewi&s;e conceive, might even make words and mu&s;ic both extemporary, and produce powerful effects from the warmth and greatne&s;s of his feelings, as we have &s;een &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted in Spain and Italy. The modern &s;erious Italian is a &s;pecies differing from all the&s;e, and not at all connected with the words, with the rhyme, or the cadence of poetry: it is not the words, but the pa&s;&s;ion, which is here &s;et to mu&s;ic. The relation&s;hip be|tween mu&s;ic and ver&s;e, which we are &s;till fooli&s;hly in&s;i&s;ting on being &s;i&s;ter arts, is here quite worn out: our mu&s;ic is now in|&s;ulated and governed by laws of her own, and no longer grows out of our language. In the comic or lively, the mu&s;ic may ex|pre&s;s the mea&s;ure or jingle of the ver&s;e, though not very clo&s;ely, and &s;he ought even there to take liberties of her own: but in the &s;erious &s;he moves with too much pa&s;&s;ion and dignity to follow the mea&s;ure
<PB N="382" REF="393">
of ver&s;e, or any mea&s;ures but her own; and the words or <HI>voci</HI> are obviou&s;ly &s;econd|ary. So that there &s;eems to be growing up a &s;pecific difference between <HI>&s;ong</HI> and <HI>aria;</HI> in the fir&s;t, the words being the main object, and the tune or mu&s;ic &s;econdary; and in the <HI>aria,</HI> the contrary.</P>
<P>Words, when &s;ung, as already ob&s;erved, &s;hould be called by &s;ome other name (as <HI>voci mu&s;icale</HI> or <HI>cantabile</HI>), as they are then transformed into another cla&s;s, with qualities entirely different, though not ea&s;y to define: they are converted from con|ventional &s;igns of ideas, to be a part of the mo&s;t original expre&s;&s;ions of nature and of pa&s;&s;ion, and affect us no longer as words, but as part of the mu&s;ic,&mdash;a part that helps to direct the mind towards the object or meaning of the melody, but not too direct and preci&s;ely; they may help to give vent to the pa&s;&s;ion, but not to explain or define it; that, when nece&s;&s;ary, is the office of recitative, as well as that of carrying on the action or &s;tory. We &s;hall very &s;eldom find Meta&s;ta&s;io guilty of the ab&s;urdity of <HI>&s;inging events,</HI> or a &s;tory, in the laboured melody
<PB N="383" REF="394">
of <HI>aria,</HI> which mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the language of pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ical philo&s;opher would &s;oon perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome mu&s;ical lan|guage being con&s;tructed on purpo&s;e, if the Italian were not already made to his hand; its <HI>voci</HI> are tolerably con&s;tructed both as to force and beauty&mdash;the &s;ounds and articula|tions of the right kind, and &s;o combinable as to favour both the forcible and the beau|tiful modes of mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, and to maintain that continued and flowing de&s;ire which keeps moving unbroken within cer|tain limits or lines of beauty; not in &s;harp angles, or cut into pieces, like the mu&s;ic of mo&s;t other nations. Their words, or <HI>voci,</HI> do not, like ours, &s;top the mu&s;ical voice, but help to bring it forth, and produce that fulne&s;s and length of &s;ound, &s;upported on &s;trong and well placed articulations, which, like &s;teps, bear up, and carry on the voice, make it rebound, and keep the mind, as it were, &s;u&s;pended or floating in that kind of plea&s;ure which forms the chief part of what I call the mu&s;ical affection. But I believe it is impo&s;&s;ible to explain the&s;e things in words, and I do not expect to be well un|der&s;tood,
<PB N="384" REF="395">
nor is it perhaps very nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould attempt it; our friend Dr. Burney will make the&s;e things plainer to you, and I flatter my&s;elf he will generally be found of my opinion; my not being of his would make me doubt or retract.</P>
<P>In mu&s;ic there are probably &s;ome certain principles of beauty in which almo&s;t all nations would agree, if we could, in &s;o|ciety, pre&s;erve our native feelings to judge of them: but tho&s;e feelings, altered and weakned by civilization, are perhaps no longer equal to the ta&s;k; our feelings &s;ub|&s;ide even while we write about them, and as we attempt to define, they evaporate. We know they are &s;ubject to the powers of habit, or &s;econd nature, for we &s;ee dif|ferent nations love very different &s;orts of mu&s;ic, and I have &s;een &s;ome who love none. We may now be &s;o far beneath the feelings and enthu&s;ia&s;m of former times, as to have hardly enough remaining to judge of theirs, or to form theories and &s;pecula|tions on the&s;e &s;ubjects: and in the&s;e writ|ing and civilized ages, theory &s;eems to be our <HI>fort,</HI> and our greate&s;t plea&s;ure, and if
<PB N="385" REF="396">
we mi&s;s that, we &s;hall have little el&s;e re|maining. Such appears to be the progre&s;s of &s;ociety: in &s;ome of its earlier &s;tages, with higher &s;entiments and powers of exertion, men do great things for their more enlightened po&s;terity to write and talk about; and the&s;e two different employ|ments &s;uit the two different periods and characters: the plea&s;ure of the one con|&s;i&s;ting in action, and of the other in know|ledge. By the time we have &s;ettled a good theory of mu&s;ic, and of mu&s;ical &s;entiment (if ever we do), perhaps the mu&s;ical age will be over, if it is not over already. The critics came after Homer, who made poetry and rules all at once. Genius and judgment, when joined, &s;eem but one &s;en|timent; and the fir&s;t feeling or judgment of real genius is perhaps more infallible than that of the mo&s;t laborious rea&s;on|ing.</P>
<P>The heroic, poetic, and mu&s;ical ages, probably come together, or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, producing each other, and before that of

higher civilization, which di&s;pels the others. The people of Paris and of London have, I think, the wor&s;t ta&s;te in mu&s;ic of any people in Europe.</P>
<P>We have learned from our ma&s;ters the Italians, that the fir&s;t merit of any mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ts much in its near re&s;emblance to that of the human voice: but hardly any of us, be&s;ides the Italians, have any voices worth imitating, except the little we &s;ome|times learn from them: they are readily admitted not only to the &s;econd, but to the fir&s;t place, by all tho&s;e nations who have &s;hewn the be&s;t ta&s;te, and have pro|duced the be&s;t mu&s;ic: it was re&s;erved for the French, and &s;ome of the Engli&s;h (nei|ther of whom have &s;hewn much good ta&s;te, nor good mu&s;ic), to di&s;pute the &s;uperiority with the Italians: but it is the a&s;s in the lion's &s;kin; they &s;tand alone, and only them&s;elves could ever think of comparing their heavy and vulgar compo&s;itions with the elegant and powerful productions of that refined people.

<P>After the Italians, the Spaniards, per|haps the next in mu&s;ic, have kept up the be&s;t national ta&s;te for &s;ome time; and are likewi&s;e next to them in &s;inging, which they do naturally and delicately, and which is perhaps chiefly owing likewi&s;e to their language: but they too, admirers of the Italian &s;tyle, will probably adopt it &s;o heartily as to lo&s;e their own, which is per|haps the national mu&s;ic mo&s;t to be re|gretted in the general lo&s;s. All who are acquainted with the <HI>&s;eguidilla</HI> and <HI>zarzue|la,</HI> would gladly hope, that their &s;ingular, ingenious, and expre&s;&s;ive delicacy might pre&s;erve them from the general ruin which, from Italy, now threatens the mu&s;ic of all other nations.</P>
<P>In&s;trumental mu&s;ic advances, I think, apace, while that of &s;ong, the &s;ource of all,

&s;tands &s;till, or, what is wor&s;e, runs wild. Though the be&s;t parts of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic may be tho&s;e that are &s;aid to &s;ing, and their fir&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able merit is their near imitation of the human voice, yet each in&s;trument has a peculiar &s;tyle of execution, and kind of mu&s;ic of its own; and the performers in tho&s;e paths produce many beauties foreign to &s;ong, though nece&s;&s;a|rily mixed with it: be&s;ides, a natural de&s;ire for variety and novelty, a nece&s;&s;ary relief for &s;ong it&s;elf, all require that in&s;trumental mu&s;ic mu&s;t not always be &s;inging; as it cannot rai&s;e the mu&s;ical affection in the mind &s;o ea&s;ily, nor to &s;o high a pitch, as &s;ong, it mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the variety of execution, of movement, modulation, melody, in order to command and &s;urpri&s;e the attention. But let us pray that this kind of mu&s;ic may pa&s;s only for what it is worth: voices imitating in&s;truments is cer|tainly a fal&s;e ta&s;te, and let us hope that the world <HI>en reviendra.</HI></P>

Mu&s;ic has, at times, been &s;hackled with various pedantic rules, which have been afterwards broken and removed by &s;ome of tho&s;e original and friendly ge|niu&s;es that now and then ari&s;e to &s;et us free again: the&s;e Frenchmen want to &s;hackle it &s;till more, and in&s;i&s;t on the compo&s;er and &s;inger attending to the accent and quantity of their pro&s;aic and antimu&s;ical language. The French had their pre&s;ent &s;tyle of mu&s;ic from Italy by means of Lully and Rameau, and the Engli&s;h by Handel; but they both now ab&s;urdly attempt to refu&s;e following their ma&s;ters the Italians, when they de&s;erve it more; and they are left behind, to &s;tand alone, and render their defects in mu&s;ical ta&s;te the more con&s;picuous.

<P>But, in &s;hort, mu&s;ic is an affair of &s;enti|ment, and the only que&s;tion is, Do you like it?

<P>We have had a Purcel, and the Scotch have &s;hewn &s;ome mu&s;ical &s;entiment by their &s;ongs, or national melodies: but then &s;ome think it was more generally taught at our common &s;chools, and country choirs were well filled, and vied with each other in ta&s;te and performance. A continuance of the&s;e excellent cu&s;toms might have pro|duced a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Purcels, which, in|deed, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="392" REF="403">
of the art: &s;uch a progre&s;&s;ion might, by this time, have worn away many dif|ficulties and impediments: but our lan|guage, and our voices, though both might be improved, will long, I fear, keep our national ta&s;te below mediocrity, and doom|ed to follow the Italians at a great di&s;tance. However, by liberally encouraging them as they de&s;erve, the art may flouri&s;h with you, even more than in any other capi|tal in Europe: but where it has cea&s;ed being taught at common &s;chools, where that mu&s;e is not born and bred, and does not proceed &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the genius and manners of the people, nor grow out of their language, &s;he may be invited over and nur&s;ed up as the &s;lave of luxury, and may admini&s;ter &s;ome feeble plea&s;ures to the exhau&s;ted feelings of the great; but her native vigour and abilities will not appear in &s;uch countries, nor can much of the na|tural influence of her art be thus forced downwards, beginning, as it were, at the wrong end.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="404">Hence the mu&s;ical judgment, or &s;en&s;ibi|lity of your audience, will probably be always &s;omewhat low and defective, and the encoring of <HI>Roa&s;t Beef,</HI> or of &s;ome little popular <HI>rondo,</HI> or vulgar ballad, will long continue to &s;hew the extent of their ta&s;te and knowledge: they &s;eem to judge of &s;ong and melody by &s;ome &s;tandard of the lowe&s;t vulgarity, taken from the alehou&s;e or Vauxhall, or at be&s;t from &s;ome old-fa&s;hioned in&s;trumental execution, or &s;ome|times from their heavy drawling church &s;tyle. And even among your mo&s;t im|proved and cultivated ears, how few are yet found capable of feeling the merits of the true Italian &s;ong, tone, and melody? And of your fingers, &s;till fewer I fear will ever be able to expre&s;s tho&s;e, or deliver the <HI>voci</HI> of that elegant language in &s;ong, or any thing like the nature and character of its <HI>cantabile</HI> expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In their mode of &s;inging and expre&s;&s;ing the Italian, it is pre&s;ently perceptible that they are at be&s;t only mimicking, like par|rots, the expre&s;&s;ions of another, and that
<PB N="394" REF="405">
they are neither thinking, nor feeling, in that language, nor know any thing of the pa&s;&s;ion they are &s;inging about, and are only trying to recollect the le&s;&s;ons of the ma&s;ter. And even the talent of mimicking, in&s;tead of feeling tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, cannot, I be|lieve, be well acquired without going to Italy while young.</P>
<P>A very different ta&s;te and degree of &s;kill and judgment are ob&s;ervable in the people or audience at Rome, and even a little difference and improvement already at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>As to your Engli&s;h and French operas, or your comedies ha&s;hed up with &s;ongs, I have gradually brought my&s;elf to feel them almo&s;t all in&s;upportable, and to think them incompatible with the principles and effects of modern mu&s;ic. Both languages are totally unfit for recitative, and thereby ex|clude all &s;ucce&s;sful attempts at &s;erious opera: the other, or comic kind, is not often much better: the tran&s;ition from &s;peech to &s;ong, and &s;till more from &s;ong to
<PB N="395" REF="406">
&s;peech, is too violent even in joke or fun, and is not long to be borne by any but French or Engli&s;h ears. If the author were a good mu&s;ician, he might contrive, with cautious art, like Shake&s;pear, to intro|duce, without offence, &s;ome &s;inging; but then it &s;hould always terminate the &s;cene, and with an exit.</P>
<P>All mu&s;ic might be divided into popular and learned, though they are generally mixed, and neither &s;pecies is found pure, or by it&s;elf: the ta&s;te, even of the lowe&s;t people, by &s;low degrees, may be perceived to advance a little into the learned. It might be curious to trace the gradual pro|gre&s;s of our ta&s;te, or de&s;ire for variety and new ideas, by long practice, from the mo&s;t &s;imple to the mo&s;t varied melody, up through all the varieties of di&s;cord, complication, contrivance. This progre&s;s is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary and natural in mu&s;ic, whatever it may be in the other arts: though it may require to be confined in its progre&s;s with|in certain wide rules or limits; yet there is
<PB N="396" REF="407">
in mu&s;ic no &s;tationary point of perfection where it ought to &s;top, as in the other arts.

<P>Tho&s;e vulgar, &s;ocial, or &s;entimental &s;ongs, and the manner of &s;inging them, in France and England, without any accom|paniment of other voice or in&s;trument, may be con&s;idered as the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of mu&s;ic,&mdash;if in that defective &s;hape they can at all be cla&s;&s;ed as mu&s;ic.

<P>To have a good mu&s;ical audience they mu&s;t all be mu&s;icians; but this cannot yet be expected, till the <HI>&s;ol fa,</HI> as we hope, be again commonly learned at &s;chool, and the <HI>guitara,</HI> or <HI>lute,</HI> as generally under&s;tood and u&s;ed in company as a pack of cards; the former talent being much ea&s;ier ac|quired, will certainly afford more plea|&s;ure than the latter. This degree of mu&s;ical ta&s;te and talents might have been, and may yet be expected to ari&s;e among us, as a natural con&s;equence of the modern im|provements, and facility in harmony and methods of teaching, with the increa&s;ing abundance of fine mu&s;ic. Such is already pretty nearly the &s;tate of mu&s;ic in &s;ome parts of Spain and Portugal: mo&s;t of the people there &s;ing, play, and under&s;tand mu&s;ic, and with very little more teaching than &s;uch as is u&s;ed in learning to walk, &s;peak, or read.

<P>I fear that native defects in &s;ome of the northern characters and languages, mu&s;t have retarded the natural progre&s;s of mu&s;ic among them: nothing but &s;ome &s;uch cir|cum&s;tance, together with the great num|ber of the ignorant keeping one another in countenance, could produce, or excu&s;e the negligence, we might almo&s;t &s;ay, the &s;tupidity of &s;o many remaining unac|quainted with &s;o &s;imple a thing as our <HI>&s;ol, fa,</HI> or &s;y&s;tem of mu&s;ic, the &s;ource of &s;o much plea&s;ure. We are told, that in Ru&s;&s;ia mu&s;ic

has long begun to make &s;ome of its natural progre&s;s among the people: and if their mu&s;icians can travel to Italy, and the Italian ma&s;ters re&s;ort to them, another mu&s;ical nation may, in time, be added to the pre&s;ent few.</P>
<P>I can never allow any merit to loudne&s;s, except in military mu&s;ic, but hardly any, except the Turks, have under&s;tood this rightly: there is a certain limit to the dif|ference or proportion between the <HI>piano</HI> and <HI>forte,</HI> which only the Italians under|&s;tand, and which the French perpetually trangre&s;s.</P>

<PB N="401" REF="412">
at the di&s;tance of perhaps a century, in the natural progre&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ical ta&s;te. You will readily perceive the mu&s;ical de|fects of our nation, and by too many &s;ymp|toms: without the true mu&s;ical &s;oul, we refine without feeling. I think this is perceptible, even in our fir&s;t-rate mu&s;ical parties,&mdash;in our having &s;o often only pro|fe&s;&s;ors to perform: by bringing a public concert into a private room, where the profe&s;&s;ed mu&s;icians direct, and the ama|teurs take no part, proceeding from the indolence and pride of luxury, and over|rating the merits of execution from a want of feeling for the expre&s;&s;ive; the party, and the mu&s;ic, become thereby much le&s;s in|tere&s;ting, and accordingly it will, in time, be heard with a cold and fa&s;hionable indif|ference, even though the merits of the per|formance &s;hould increa&s;e. Be&s;ides, profe&s;|&s;ors &s;eldom make the be&s;t choice: to &s;hine in execution is too often their object; they have not always the ta&s;te, nor the liberty, to prefer fine mu&s;ic to fine playing, and will not, in that way, contribute to improve the general ta&s;te, while there are &s;o few of tho&s;e feeling philo&s;ophic amateurs to
<PB N="402" REF="413">
direct, and who take a part. I fear we &s;hall, in time, have almo&s;t nothing but that un|feeling kind of in&s;trumental difficult mu&s;ic, &s;olos and &s;olo concertos, which, though &s;ometimes meritorious in its way, in the hands of a Giardini or a Fi&s;cher, will yet re|tard in&s;tead of promoting the &s;tudy and im|provement of various angelic kinds which, I fancy, may yet be produced,&mdash;kinds wherein the &s;peaking melodies, the heaven|ly harmony, and heart-felt tones, prevail with accumulating effects, in the form of quartettos, quintettos, or concertantes. Since Giardini is leaving us, I think we are already lo&s;ing that little ta&s;te for tone which we had acquired from him; and I fear the ta&s;te for in&s;trumental difficulties will likewi&s;e infect that of &s;inging, and take place of the truly vocal and divine, before it is brought near to perfection.</P>
<P>There is yet much to be done in mu&s;ic beyond, or as it were out of, human na|ture, and many things to be expre&s;&s;ed be|&s;ides the human feelings and pa&s;&s;ions. In attending to &s;ome of the fir&s;t-rate Italian &s;ingers, who have judgment to &s;upport a
<PB N="403" REF="414">
certain &s;imple dignity, I think we have directly &s;ome idea or inclination to place the character out of human nature, above its ordinary weakne&s;&s;es and defects, and not &s;ubject to any unmanly, querulous, or violent expre&s;&s;ion; and the &s;ingers who give into tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, or imitate too far the in&s;trumental tricks of execution, become vulgar or ridiculous like the French, or de&s;cend into the character of mere in|&s;trumental performers. There is an elegant &s;ublime &s;implicity of idea attainable in all the fine arts, which can only be explained and under&s;tood in the compo&s;itions and performance of great ma&s;ters. The idea of a divinity, for in&s;tance, formed and executed by a Praxiteles, a M. Angelo, or a Raphael, will &s;hew us, at once, what it &s;hould be, much better than can be done by words; and it will be found very dif|ferent from that of a modern French or Dutch arti&s;t, though the latter might be much higher fini&s;hed. May not we hope that this great and good ta&s;te in mu&s;ic, at lea&s;t, will continue &s;o far to prevail in Italy as to keep it&s;elf alive, and form now and then a Sene&s;ino, or a Manzoli, to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="404" REF="415">
in the world a &s;en&s;e of the true &s;ub|lime and &s;imple &s;tyle of &s;inging?</P>
<P>As to compo&s;ers, though, from a &s;carci|ty, even in Italy, of fir&s;t-rate ma&s;ters, the fiddlers may &s;eem &s;ometimes to &s;tep into their place, yet we may hope that now and then a Sacchini, and even a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch men, will probably be produced there, to poli&s;h and continue the chain of mu&s;ical progre&s;&s;ion. Is it not to Germany we owe this &s;crambling fiddling ta&s;te for execution, which threatens to infect all our mu&s;ic? I only wi&s;h to moderate, not to bani&s;h it. If tho&s;e ingenious German compo&s;ers were to &s;tudy &s;implicity a little more, and make mu&s;ic within the powers of the amateurs to perform, would it not promote and extend the art much more than by producing &s;o much that can only be executed by profe&s;|&s;ors? The Italians are often a&s;toni&s;hed to hear them, the French, and us, play &s;o well, and yet &s;ing &s;o ill, and to &s;ee us always &s;oliciting every body to &s;ing where there is nobody that can &s;ing fit to be heard. I think all the voices to the north of the Alps and the
<PB N="405" REF="416">
Pyrennees are di&s;tingui&s;hable, and mo&s;t of them defective, except &s;ome ba&s;s voices.</P>
<P>The ingenious modern way of writing or noting of mu&s;ic, which has contributed &s;o much to its progre&s;s and complication, has perhaps likewi&s;e de&s;troyed much of its fire and effects: &s;uch is the fate of every thing human; there is no good without its at|tendant evil. When we come to be &s;o &s;cientific and artificial as to write and &s;tudy mu&s;ic upon paper, the noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;imple heroic tunes is probably gone: we calmly calculate and compare the beauties and contrivances of harmony, without much feeling, or dwelling on the melody or &s;ong on the &s;entiments, the great pa&s;&s;ions, or events it expre&s;&s;es, or was wont to expre&s;s: &s;o that our plea&s;ure does not keep pace with the merits, or at lea&s;t ingenuity, of the com|po&s;itions produced, but &s;eems to go in a contrary direction; and our pa&s;&s;ion or love of mu&s;ic, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, &s;eems to cool and dimini&s;h as the variety and quantity of mu&s;ical productions increa&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="417">In the progre&s;s of refinement, we gra|dually forget that mu&s;ic was probably in|tended as an extemporary effu&s;ion of the mind, as well as a &s;ource of &s;tudious and refined plea&s;ure; but the latter, you &s;ee, gra|dually &s;wallows up the former. There are certain occa&s;ions when the mu&s;ic or the &s;ong &s;hould, at lea&s;t, appear to be the immediate effu&s;ion of the fancy or pa&s;&s;ion, and the production of the moment.

Even now, in our mo&s;t laboured compo&s;itions for the theatre, the actor or &s;inger would produce much le&s;s effect if that &s;mall degree of deception were dropped and he were to read his part, in&s;tead of getting it by heart. Hence greater and more various effects might probably be produced, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the deception, and &s;ometimes placing the whole apparatus of the orche&s;tra out of &s;ight, and moving them to different di&s;tances, as we have &s;een partially at|tempted, and generally with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="418">We <HI>tramontani</HI> are certainly too &s;tation|ary in our ta&s;te and invention, and forget that mu&s;ic is a progre&s;&s;ive art, naturally &s;ubject to perpetual progre&s;s and variation; and more e&s;pecially &s;ince we have begun to complicate and refine it, we mu&s;t let it go on; and where fancy and genius abound, the be&s;t things of la&s;t year mu&s;t cea&s;e to be the be&s;t of this,&mdash;as in Italy and Spain: but I think in France and England, they keep teazing and tiring every per&s;on of any mu&s;ical feelings with the &s;ame things to eternity.</P>

In order to be great in one thing, we mu&s;t probably be great in all,&mdash; in arts and in arms: many things, nay, every thing is perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a people to any great attempts; our pride, our ambition, and intere&s;t, mu&s;t all be flattered, and gradually fed with hopes and

<P>The great effects and love of mu&s;ic in other times and countries, might be no proof of its merit according to our &s;tandard.

by pa&s;&s;ing &s;o long through the medium of monki&s;h ignorance and bad ta&s;te: on the revival of mu&s;ic, cloi&s;tered learning might take one road, and that of &s;ociety and the &s;tage another; that this tune, our chaunts, the Spani&s;h romance, and the pre&s;ent Ita|lian recitative, may all have proceeded from the &s;ame &s;ource, though now &s;o different. The ancient Greek modes, with their mu&s;ic, their declamation, and poetry, all con|nected, I can conceive, might have pro|digious effects, and a permanent influence on their manners and character. When they became a Roman province, they pro|bably &s;oon lo&s;t tho&s;e elegant ideas and amu&s;ements. Polybius, I believe, was among the la&s;t of their writers who &s;aw, and was &s;en&s;ible of all the po&s;&s;ible influence of mu&s;ic; and it is vexatious to think, that probably no one will ever &s;ee it again.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Greeks had &s;ome good mu&s;ic, they felt &s;o true and refined, &s;o ju&s;tly in every thing. It &s;eems they had a method of notation, and with the nice&s;t ears and &s;en&s;ibility adverted to every thing

<P>We moderns have no mu&s;ical lan|guage: the expre&s;&s;ion, taken from the an|cients, is now unintelligible to us: we have no language that &s;ings, though we have mu&s;ic that &s;peaks or expre&s;&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions, in ways however of its own, quite different from tho&s;e of our elocution: the Italian being the be&s;t language for &s;inging, &s;eems to have happened almo&s;t by accident, or partly, perhaps, from &s;ome communication with the Greeks: the latter Romans had probably refined their ta&s;te and pronuncia|tion by the u&s;e of the Greek language; that ta&s;te, with the acquired habits, powers, and po&s;ture of the organs, might have &s;ome influence in the formation of the lan|guage, which came afterwards to be gradual|ly produced from the Latin, and the other languages of their neighbours and conquer|ors,

take a different path of its own: this is not an abu&s;e, but a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the now innate difference between the mu&s;ical and poetical expre&s;&s;ions, which have no relation to each other in tone, time, or rythmus, but only in the &s;entiment.

<P>A few more remarks on the ta&s;te and genius of our merry friends here, before we quit them. With all their vivacity, and great abilities and pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic, I think it is allowed, that they &s;ucceed as badly as any of us, and &s;eldomer plea&s;e any but them&s;elves in their compo&s;itions or perform|ance,&mdash;but more e&s;pecially in the vocal:
<PB N="423" REF="434">
yet, I think, while they keep within the limits of what may be called the lively or buffa &s;pecies of mu&s;ic, where the time is well marked, and its motion e&s;&s;ential, they are le&s;s offen&s;ive; many of their little airs, we all know, are rather plea&s;ing to the mo&s;t general or common ta&s;te, and that &s;ome of them are rather more than popular, or vulgarly pretty&mdash;if they could &s;ing them. But generally, in proportion as the French venture beyond tho&s;e limits (which they too frequently do), and attempt any &s;erious expre&s;&s;ion of the great pa&s;&s;ions, then they as gradually become ridiculous, and pre|&s;ently get into the vulgar &s;cream or howl, of extreme pa&s;&s;ion, or bodily pain, which is quite intolerable to every body but them|&s;elves: generally in extremes, they know but few of the numerous &s;hades between, and where beauty and elegance generally dwell. But in every thing lively or comic they certainly excel; and their <HI>petite opera,</HI> in &s;pite of their unfortunate language, voice, and manner, generally goes off tolerably well, on account of their natural, correct, and graceful action. Indeed, the wit and
<PB N="424" REF="435">
humour, the lively or comic, of every na|tion, is mo&s;tly excellent in its way, and being rather local, is what no foreigner can with propriety pretend to critici&s;e; and theirs, with the addition of the graces peculiar to them&s;elves, becomes &s;ometimes excellent. But the &s;erious being more uni|ver&s;al, and belonging to humanity in ge|neral, all are competent to decide on its merits or re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Though our mu&s;ical ta&s;te in England may be equally deficient, yet from &s;ome things that have been formerly produced among us, I can conceive a certain degree of capability in our di&s;po&s;ition and language, to|wards a kind of wild romantic or melancholy &s;ong, which might be carried much farther, if we could more frequently produce a Shake&s;pear to write, and a Purcel to compo&s;e and to &s;ing, or rather one to do all, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch men; but now, I believe, the wi&s;e&s;t thing for us would be to remain &s;ilent for a while, and let the Italians &s;ing to us, and travel to Italy while young, till we learn to &s;ing like them: indeed, theirs
<PB N="425" REF="436">
is probably the only language now fit to be &s;ung, and all nations, who have any ta&s;te, will learn and adopt it for that purpo&s;e, as Spain and Portugal. Nor are the&s;e things of &s;uch &s;mall con&s;equence as may at fir&s;t appear: if we have &s;poiled our mouths, our language, and our ears, by fal&s;e delicacy and affectation, the&s;e defects will extend to &s;eemingly di&s;tant objects: the &s;en&s;e em|ployed in judging of the&s;e things can like|wi&s;e judge of others; and when it is &s;poiled, its errors and deficiencies will have influ|ence, not only on our mu&s;ic, but on all &s;ubjects where the ear and the mouth are concerned, and perhaps on many others where the connection is le&s;s obvious.</P>
<P>By <HI>accumulation,</HI> analogous &s;entiments a&s;&s;i&s;t and augment each other prodigiou&s;ly: they multiply and increa&s;e the impre&s;&s;ions, in &s;ome duplicate or higher proportion, much beyond the &s;um of all: if, for ex|ample, in mu&s;ic, to a fine <HI>tone</HI> be added the <HI>chiarezza, vaghezza,</HI> and good <HI>modu|lation,</HI> and then a good <HI>portamento,</HI> the effects will increa&s;e in &s;ome &s;uch progre&s;|&s;ion;

and, conver&s;ely, a deficiency in any of the&s;e will proportionally affect the whole: now, I fear, we are generally de|ficient in mo&s;t of the&s;e, and &s;ometimes in all.

I have ob&s;erved, that few of the poets of the&s;e days have much ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, but I have known mu&s;icians who had a ta&s;te for poetry: all this is from be&s;towing too much time and atten|tion on one thing, and remaining unac|quainted with others, from a too great di|vi&s;ion of the arts; and the mu&s;ical ear, when turned to tho&s;e objects, will be found, at lea&s;t, as capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing as any other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the above was written, I have &s;een Rou&s;&s;eau's letter on mu&s;ic, and am plea&s;ed to find I have mo&s;tly adopted his ideas: only I think he is &s;till embarra&s;&s;ed, by con&s;ider|ing mu&s;ic or &s;inging as a &s;pecies of elocution or declama|tion, and in endeavouring to &s;ubject it to &s;ome of the rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;peaking: whereas, I am &s;till inclined to con&s;ider the mu&s;ical art now as totally different, and &s;ubject only to rules of its own.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. A. J&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE you leave home, you will, of cour&s;e, direct your reading to the objects in view, and &s;ee your own country: without the&s;e it would, indeed, be hardly worth while to go abroad and wa&s;te the time, which, in many other ca&s;es, becomes doubtful if it might not be better &s;pent at home: but if you mean, like too many of our young travellers, to run away from your &s;tudies, or from your&s;elf, into all the French non-&s;en&s;e and <HI>etourderie</HI> of the fa&s;hionable and fooli&s;h world, I have no advice to give, nor could you take it if I had: not that I wi&s;h to curtail the few trappings and plea|&s;ures of life, and cut utility to the quick; I only mean to relinqui&s;h advi&s;ing, in mat|ters
<PB N="430" REF="441">
of mere amu&s;ement, to others better qualified, and to recommend mixing bu&s;i|ne&s;s with plea&s;ure for the advantage of both, and am totally again&s;t travelling without &s;ome tutor or friend; it will re|quire all the efforts and knowledge of both to extract the e&s;&s;ence of utility in travelling. We &s;ee too many idle and vicious young Engli&s;hmen, running about the world alone, without either re&s;traint or a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, both of which they &s;tand &s;o much in need of.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Paris you may find a very agreeable place, if you are well recom|mended, and likewi&s;e very u&s;eful to your views of &s;tudy, if you have re&s;olution enough not to be di&s;&s;ipated by its frivolous amu&s;e|ments; which is not &s;o difficult, I think, as in London; and you may be le&s;s &s;ubject to various di&s;tractions and interruptions. This is more like a great country town, and not the &s;eat of the court, nor of commerce, and therefore, I conceive, more agreeable. Peo|ple here &s;eem to have more lei&s;ure and in|clination to conver&s;e,&mdash;to &s;tudy, or philo|&s;ophize
<PB N="431" REF="442">
with us; while in London, you all &s;eem perpetually ab&s;orbed in &s;ome anxi|ous pur&s;uit,&mdash;in the hurry and fatigue of bu&s;ine&s;s. Hence the agreeable arts of life are here more con&s;idered and improved, though oftner mixed up with a trifling or bad ta&s;te. Many things that are treated with neglect and contempt by your &s;ulky matter-of-fact-men, become here of an agreeable importance. And if their people of fa&s;hion, their arti&s;ts, teachers, <HI>modi&s;tes,</HI> &amp;c. had but a little more true ta&s;te, travel, and knowledge of nature, many of their trifles might probably grow into real con|&s;equence among people of &s;en&s;e, through|out the re&s;t of Europe, as well as here. If it &s;hould become the fa&s;hion among them, again, to travel, and to encourage &s;trangers of merit, their &s;uperior vivacity and quick|ne&s;s of abilities would again appear, and turn to account.</P>
<P>If you can &s;teadily pur&s;ue your plan of &s;tudies here, in chemi&s;try, anatomy, phi|lo&s;ophy, you may get more u&s;eful know|ledge in two years, than in all the five you
<PB N="432" REF="443">
have pa&s;&s;ed at college. I am only in doubt if &s;ome of the time might not be better pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome part of Germany, were it only for the habits of &s;teadine&s;s and application which may be acquired there.</P>
<P>To this agreeable nation and language, the world is, and may yet be indebted for many good things. Their manners and conver&s;ation, as well as &s;ituation, may long continue to attract the &s;trangers of every country, and form a beneficial intimacy among us all&mdash;a kind of &s;tandard and point of re-union for European manners and &s;ociety, which may have influence even on public mea&s;ures and opinions, may &s;often and humanize the unfeeling maxims of &s;tate policy, and retard our falling, or driving each other, back into barbari&s;m. We may, and perhaps ought, now to go on and poli&s;h our&s;elves upon them, and may gain more than we lo&s;e, by rubbing off &s;ome, though formerly valuable and di&s;tingui&s;hing, points of national character. As nations mix and become better members of this European &s;ociety, or republic,
<PB N="433" REF="444">
which &s;eems now gradually to a&s;&s;imilate and a&s;&s;ociate more intimately than former|ly. We mu&s;t all conform, in many things, to what the majority may plea&s;e to deter|mine: &s;o that it becomes daily more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that this central and leading nation be well &s;tudied and known, e&s;pecially by all tho&s;e who may have any public part to act.</P>
<P>Although, in judging of ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment, we can, none of us, pretend to ab&s;o|lute impartiality, and although I am, rather voluntarily, an imperfect critic in poetic affairs; yet, you &s;ee we are not therefore deterred from judging for our&s;elves, and I feel not the le&s;s decided, even in the mo&s;t &s;ingular opinions. You know, that I think they have hardly any poetry in French, and, to my ear, their language is incapable of the true &s;ublime. Whatever good &s;en&s;e, or beautiful imagery, we may admire in their be&s;t poets, tho&s;e are produced inde|pendently of their language; nor can their &s;entiments receive tho&s;e embelli&s;hments which are conveyed by &s;ound, till tran&s;lated
<PB N="434" REF="445">
into languages more capable of be&s;towing them. I have met with &s;everal of their pieces, which, in their native tongue, are &s;en&s;ible and intere&s;ting, but, when tran&s;lated into Italian, become likewi&s;e beautiful, and hence more intere&s;ting. I confe&s;s, how|ever, a decided partiality, you know, for the Italian, which, to me, appears the only modern language capable of expre&s;&s;|ing the poetic beauties, by the help of &s;ounds. Nor does this predilection proceed entirely from its aptne&s;s for vocal mu&s;ic, as many of their fir&s;t productions in poetry are not the fitte&s;t to be &s;ung: but this language &s;eems now the only one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e beautiful combinations and arrangements of &s;ounds that can charm the ear as well as the under&s;tanding, and from the effects of accummulation, both the&s;e powers are mu|tually increa&s;ed. And yet the&s;e &s;ounds are totally different from, and independent on mu&s;ic. It would be difficult and tedious to explain here, in what their effects and beau|ties con&s;i&s;t. To be &s;en&s;ible of them, the be&s;t way is to learn the language in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="446">I ought likewi&s;e to confe&s;s, that what plea&s;es me mo&s;t is that familiar and natural &s;implicity we meet with in Petrarch, Dante, Boyardo, Ario&s;to, Boccacio, &amp;c. &amp;c. with which I am &s;o charmed, that after reading them, I cannot, for a long time, reli&s;h any other &s;tyle. A French bur&s;ting or drawl|ing attempt at &s;ublimity would then make me &s;ick.</P>
<P>Another, with different ta&s;te and habits, might think this all prejudice or prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. Hence we are led to doubt the certainty of any &s;tandard or fixed principles in ta&s;te. And this uncertainty mu&s;t pro|bably ever prevail in practice, after all that has been written and taught about it, &s;o long as cu&s;tom continues to be a kind of &s;econd nature. At lea&s;t, in this manner, are we obliged to &s;ettle the matter, as well as we can, in accounting for the great di|ver&s;ity in ta&s;te, and of the opinions con|cerning it.</P>
<P>But although we can never bring all men to like and di&s;like the &s;ame things, and in
<PB N="436" REF="447">
the &s;ame degree, and each of us will have his own &s;cale or gradation of beauties; yet we &s;ee &s;ome things are univer&s;ally liked; and there are, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome principles, or extended limits, where beauty ends and deformity begins, and within which, men and nations may differ without being wrong.</P>
<P>Both we and the French have likewi&s;e had that &s;imple <HI>naif</HI> manner of writing, before mentioned, and abandoned it again, I think, too &s;oon, before it was perfected. They, &s;oon after Montaigne, left, in&s;tead of imitating, his frank, ea&s;y, and graceful manner, which I con&s;ider as the natural <HI>fort</HI> of their language: they have, &s;ince, attempted, and gone through, &s;everal dif|ferent &s;tyles in writing, to &s;ome of which it is certainly not &s;o well adapted. They have written in the turgid and conceited, in the tedious and languid, manner. The fa&s;hion &s;eems now, the rapid, &s;hort, fiery &s;tyle, of declaiming on every &s;ubject, which I think an&s;wers pretty well in &s;ome ca&s;es, and &s;uits the language, when em|ployed
<PB N="437" REF="448">
with judgment and &s;implicity, in which, however, they are often deficient, and can &s;eldom keep within the bounds of moderation. Voltaire I con&s;ider as their great and be&s;t leader in this, and he has already had, and may yet have, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful followers. But you have, doubtle&s;s, al|ready good enough accounts of the&s;e things.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXIII.</HI> The French a great Nation.&mdash;General Re|flections.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. A. J&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN con&s;idering the French, we are &s;ome|times led to doubt or wonder, how a nation, made up of &s;uch defects, under the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive kind of government, could ever be &s;o great in &s;o many ways. On examining the country, and &s;eeing how the people live,&mdash;bread almo&s;t their only food, and not always good, nor plenty: &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of the fruits of their own labour for them&s;elves, and that &s;hare not very &s;ecure: though often apparently con|tented and happy, we mu&s;t doubt the reali|ty of that happine&s;s:&mdash;if really contented with poverty and dependance&mdash;with dirt and mi&s;ery, we mu&s;t expect but little vigour or exertion from &s;uch a people. How|ever
<PB N="439" REF="450">
we may be inclined, in &s;peculation, to magnify the influence of moral and phy&s;ical defects, with which we are not much acquainted, and to feel too great a contempt for whatever differs from us, though only in appearance; we mu&s;t re|collect, that men are men, though in rags and wooden &s;hoes; and twenty millions of people &s;o well &s;ituated, and compre&s;&s;ed as the&s;e are, and with &s;o happy a di&s;po&s;ition, if only left to them&s;elves, and protected from foreign injury, and from each other, even though con&s;iderably oppre&s;&s;ed by their government; mu&s;t &s;till be a great nation, as the world goes; <HI>dans le pa&iuml;s des aveugles, les borgnes &s;ont rois:</HI> and we know that the&s;e people have the art to appear &s;till greater than they really are, and to acquire more than their due &s;hare of influence in the &s;cale of Europe. With half their pre|&s;ent evils and impediments removed, they might perhaps be too great for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>What a pity you Engli&s;h do not chu&s;e to be more amiable, that you might rival them in every thing, and even in their own way.
<PB N="440" REF="451">
But, indeed, I think rudene&s;s is now the mode in both countries: the French took it up, probably from fancying it was Eng|li&s;h, and we copy it from them. An af|fected cold &s;tare of indifference, or <HI>noncha|lance,</HI> now meets you in all fa&s;hionable &s;ocieties&mdash;it is alleged, by way of leaving you at your ea&s;e; very different from the over-anxious, the trouble&s;ome attention and politene&s;s of former times. Their morn|ing dre&s;s, which they call <HI>&agrave; l'Anglois,</HI> is per|fectly &s;lovenly, and often na&s;ty. The man|ners, in &s;ome provincial towns, where one meets yet with a little old-fa&s;hioned civility and formality, <HI>de la vicille cour,</HI> I find far more agreeable.</P>
<P>There are certain advantages, if we knew how to u&s;e them, that attend every character and way of life. Even poverty has its advantages. This people, though not equal to us in &s;trength, re&s;olution, per|&s;everance, yet, in many &s;ituations, would be able to exi&s;t, while we &s;hould &s;tarve. And this we &s;hall find to be the ca&s;e, in &s;ome degree, on comparing our&s;elves with
<PB N="441" REF="452">
mo&s;t of the other inhabitants of Europe. Great things have &s;ometimes been done by their armies. In the hands of a ma&s;ter, an indifferent in&s;trument becomes a good one. The great man, who knows the <HI>fort</HI> and the foible of his nation, will do as much with &s;uch indifferent tools as &s;ome others with the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Fortunately, mankind have generally &s;ome motives for exertion, and are natu|rally &s;o bent on getting forwards, that they can hardly be kept back by the mo&s;t power|ful impediments, &s;uch as civil and religious tyranny, joined to &s;hackle them. Their natural wants and pa&s;&s;ions will not let them &s;it long &s;till. And here, their lively and agreeable manner, and perpetual appear|ance of activity, all help to impo&s;e a little, and make them &s;eem capable of more than they really are. You know, that the world con&s;iders things in a &s;lovenly way, and how few are above the vulgar methods of judging of men and things, of merit, of characters, by a few outward appear|ances,
<PB N="442" REF="453">
or by &s;ome accidental &s;ucce&s;s; leav|ing the few ob&s;ervers of men to look nearer, and e&s;timate their real value. You are a great nation, made up of great and &s;olid materials, like the buildings of the Romans. This is a great nation, but com|po&s;ed of le&s;&s;er materials, like the tabique walls of the Moors.</P>
<P>However, not only comparatively, but rather po&s;itively and intrin&s;ically, we mu&s;t allow this nation a great deal of merit, of indu&s;try, and other virtues, in &s;pite of all their faults and weakne&s;&s;es,&mdash;of poverty and bad government. But they, as well as other people, are fitter for &s;ome things than for others. I &s;hould, for example, think them fitter for manufactures than for agriculture or navigation. And it might be from &s;ome idea of this kind, that the great Colbert &s;eemed to promote manufac|tures and commerce, beyond what the na|ture of the country has been thought to require, by other great men, as Sully, &amp;c. They are known to be far better for an
<PB N="443" REF="454">
attack than for defence, which you &s;hould never forget. But I do not wi&s;h to give you remarks already well known.</P>
<P>It is not to prejudice you again&s;t this people, that I endeavour to &s;ift out their faults and defects. I wi&s;h to point out to you the le&s;s obvious, the hidden flaws of things, which you may, one day, exa|mine for your&s;elf; and that you may be led to look farther than the &s;urface of appearances, which is certainly full as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this country as in any other.</P>
<P>We all &s;ee through different mediums. It is difficult, and perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to give or acquire &s;ome &s;orts of knowledge, without prejudice. All knowledge, that de&s;erves the name, tends to &s;y&s;tem. Things, in order to be under&s;tood, mu&s;t be arranged: but our &s;y&s;tem once arran|ged, becomes it&s;elf the &s;ource of prejudices, and when joined to tho&s;e of habit and education, forms a &s;tream which few can leave or with&s;tand. Do not previou&s;ly, if you can help it, adopt any &s;y&s;tem of mine,
<PB N="444" REF="455">
nor any other, that may lead you to pre|judge the cau&s;e. Read and arrange, but doubt of all till you &s;ee.</P>
<P>But human nature would not advance, and experience would be of little &s;ervice to mankind, if that of each individual were confined to his own u&s;e. And yet it cannot often be taught, or applied to the u&s;e of others, &s;o as to &s;ave them the trouble of going over the &s;ame ground, though it may help to direct them in their road.</P>
<P>In di&s;tingui&s;hing what we &s;hould be taught, from that which we &s;hould teach our&s;elves, we &s;hall probably perceive, that in the early &s;tages of &s;ociety, men are na|turally in the fir&s;t extreme, of tru&s;ting to them&s;elves, and being taught too little: and that we moderns are arrived at the &s;econd, of expecting too much from in&s;truction, leaving too little to nature and to our own re&s;earches.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="456">I only meant to &s;ketch you out a few of the mo&s;t &s;triking features of the out|line, to be filled up from your own fu|ture experience and ob&s;ervation. But with all my zeal and &s;incerity, I may not &s;uc|ceed, even in the little I attempt. I think we &s;eldom can, in this way, give all the ideas we intend.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. C. J&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>fort</HI> of this people con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in appearances, and of a very engaging kind, you will be more &s;ubject to over-rate their merits than their defects, and the danger will be in your finding them too agreeable. Many of us, who &s;et out to vi&s;it Europe, at lea&s;t, &s;eem to be caught and attached here; and when we reflect, and a&s;k our&s;elves, how we come to &s;pend &s;o much of our time and money among &s;uch trifling people as here abound, of both natives and &s;trangers?&mdash;how, and where|fore, &s;o many of us get together in the&s;e French towns, as if merely to walk about
<PB N="447" REF="458">
and play cards?&mdash;we are, perhaps, a&s;hamed to confe&s;s all the truth, and have recour&s;e to various pretexts, to deceive our&s;elves and our friends. At home, I think we hardly perceive &s;o many idle people in the whole country, as may here be found, of Engli&s;h only, a&s;&s;embled in one French town. Our be&s;t travellers go farther. Our men of ta&s;te and learning per&s;evere, and get on to Italy at lea&s;t. So that you will increa&s;e your advantages the farther you go. Be|&s;ides tho&s;e of &s;eeing things more worthy your attention, you will meet with travel|lers more worth knowing than tho&s;e who &s;tick fa&s;t here, taken with the frivolous plea&s;ures of French &s;ocieties, and with the cringing ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of the mi&s;erable crowd.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be more &s;atisfied if we always acquired, by the&s;e little French trips, a greater e&s;teem and love for our own coun|try, as one would think we naturally ought; but I fear many return with le&s;s, in&s;tead of more, aver&s;ion to &s;lavery and
<PB N="448" REF="459">
wooden &s;hoes: nay, there are &s;ome who are not a&s;hamed to profe&s;s a preference for the&s;e poor tyrannized countries, in&s;i&s;ting, that it is only &s;uch that are fit for a gentle|man to live in: but, indeed, that is gene|rally after their return, for, while here, I think we all agree, as u&s;ual, in abu&s;ing the country where we live.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I am &s;till a warm advocate for travelling whenever it is po&s;&s;ible, and I fancy that &s;omething good always &s;ticks, even to the idle&s;t of our ramblers; and that they may afterwards be always readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mere John Bull, fox-hunter, or country &s;quire, by their con|ver&s;ation, attention, or &s;omething in their manner.</P>
<P>Although we Engli&s;h generally a&s;&s;ort and live too much together abroad, &s;ome few of us, however, as &s;tragglers from the main body, prefer the company of the French; and they, on perceiving our de&s;ire to be acquainted, meet us more than half way,
<PB N="449" REF="460">
in that prettie&s;t frank and cheerful manner with which, indeed, they do every thing. They are extremely and agreeably good, and &s;pare no pains, nor civility, to oblige us, while we take care not to put them to any expence, to which they are not ea&s;ily inclined: a di&s;po&s;ition which I approve. Their &s;pirit of oeco|nomy is, to me, delightful, and ought to make us a&s;hamed of our extravagance, in&s;tead of the contrary, which we too ge|nerally feel.</P>
<P>Certainly nothing can be more complete|ly agreeable than &s;ome of their people of fa&s;hion. The trouble&s;ome affectation of <HI>etourderie,</HI> in their young men, I find the lea&s;t bearable part of their &s;ociety. A young Frenchman is like a greyhound puppy, and teazes you without mercy or meaning. But the grace and readine&s;s of their manner and conver&s;ation makes one wi&s;h to forgive them a thou&s;and things. The French, in general, like the ladies, are never awkward, except where &s;trength is required&mdash;<HI>Si manier&eacute;s,</HI> as they &s;o pret|tily
<PB N="450" REF="461">
expre&s;s it. It is vain, and mean, in your beaux, to attempt to copy the&s;e. In &s;ome men of riper years, we meet with all the graces of youth, joined with that ur|banity, attention, and good &s;en&s;e, which all agree to admire, and wi&s;h to imitate, as the confe&s;&s;ed model of manner and conver&s;ation: and in all &s;orts of good behaviour, &s;ome of them may nearly de&s;erve the place they a&s;&s;ume of dictators, and in fact, may &s;tand next to the Spaniards, who, I think, are yet univer&s;ally the be&s;t-behaved people in Europe, and the only people, in any given circum&s;tances, who&s;e behaviour may be entirely depended on. I fear the Engli&s;h begin to be le&s;s con&s;idered and &s;ought after, in this country, than for|merly.</P>
<P>You already know the high e&s;teem and re&s;pect due here to many of their philo&s;o|phers and men of letters, who have laid open &s;cience, and combated error, even in the &s;tate, with a &s;pirit that would do ho|nour to the free&s;t nations: and that the ladies have regained, and have nobly joined
<PB N="451" REF="462">
much of their natural influence, towards bringing philo&s;ophy and &s;cience into real and active life: and though &s;ucce&s;s, as to general and practical utility, is probably limited nearly within the pre&s;ent circle, by the nature of their government and reli|gion; yet they have brought much u&s;eful and agreeable knowledge to light, and have laid it ready to be taken up by the people whenever they may have liberty and &s;ecurity enough to make it worth their while, and when their government may con&s;i&s;t of the wi&s;dom and virtue that may then be found in &s;uch a na|tion.</P>
<P>We ought not, perhaps, to be &s;o rigid, as to condemn or de&s;pi&s;e their little arts of deceiving them&s;elves, and us, a little, into &s;uppo&s;ing that the u&s;eful &s;ciences are ge|nerally cultivated and applied throughout the country, becau&s;e they write and talk &s;o well about them at Paris. Nay, we may admire that addre&s;s with which they prejudice us all in their favour, and per|&s;uade more than half Europe to believe the

Any effectual reform in their government or con&s;titution is highly improbable: none but the princes can ever have power enough to do it; and we know how unlikely it is, from their education and national di&s;po&s;ition, that any of them can ever have the will, the knowledge, or cha|racter equal to it.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXV.</HI> On our Changes in Ta&s;te, &amp;c. &mdash; Of the French Military.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. A. J&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU need not fear my becoming a convert to French manners and opinions, or that I &s;hall deviate much from my fir&s;t plan, which was, to deal more in finding fault, than in finding out things worthy of prai&s;e or imitation. The fir&s;t I &s;till think one of the great plea&s;ures and advantages of travelling: it maintains and increa&s;es our ideas of improvement and perfection; and the&s;e are ideas of great importance in the world, though they &s;hould never be put in practice. The &s;econd cla&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> of good things, &s;uch as are worthy of imitation, become obvious enough, and will &s;trike at &s;ight, without being pointed out, and are generally better
<PB N="457" REF="468">
known than the defects, which are the proper objects of improvement.</P>
<P>But I have no objection to change, nor to tell you when I do; as I wi&s;h not to conceal, but to &s;hew you every part of the hi&s;tory of my own mind, that I think may be of any u&s;e to you; though we are very apt to be ob&s;tinate in &s;upport of what we have once happened to advance, probably from a natural idea of the importance of being con&s;i&s;tent,&mdash;but oftener, I fear, from a fal&s;e pride.</P>
<P>I may, doubtle&s;s, be gradually reconcil|ed, by habit, to many things which re|volted me at fir&s;t; but, I doubt, I mu&s;t always retain my fir&s;t di&s;like of others. I mu&s;t &s;till in&s;i&s;t on finding fault, for example, with their ta&s;te in mo&s;t of the fine arts,&mdash; in mu&s;ic, poetry, tragic action, drawing, architecture,&mdash;with their government and admini&s;tration,&mdash;with &s;everal in&s;titutions,&mdash; with their taxes, farming, &s;everal trades; and mu&s;t ever regret the poverty and op|pre&s;&s;ion of their lower cla&s;&s;es. Although
<PB N="458" REF="469">
&s;o great a difference of ta&s;te and &s;entiment be a kind of a &s;ocial lo&s;s to my&s;elf, not to reli&s;h or enjoy what I often &s;ee all around me enraptured with; yet I cannot always feel with them, though I have made many, and &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful, endeavours for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You know their military character, and their pa&s;&s;ion for arms, which proceeds chiefly, I believe, from a kind of vanity, and partly, perhaps, to revenge their do|me&s;tic &s;lavery on their neighbours. They were among the fir&s;t who contributed to bring us all under the ruinous nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up the&s;e numerous &s;tanding armies, which will probably, in time, again de&s;troy all good government, and involve the world in tyranny and barbari&s;m once more, unle&s;s their increa&s;e be checked, and their con&s;titu|tion improved, by gradually reverting to militias to &s;upply them with men, and partly to &s;upply their places; and by re&s;toring good legi&s;lation with military education, and thence morals, manners, and good order. The French have, perhaps, occa&s;ion for greater
<PB N="459" REF="470">
armies than &s;ome other nations, to do the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e a weaker race of people, and more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved by fa|tigue. During an ordinary campaign, they have often had one-third, or more, of their army in the ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>By the&s;e &s;tanding armies, their govern|ment has obtained the double object, of oppo&s;ing their enemies abroad, and &s;ub|duing the nation at home. And the in|tention has &s;ucceeded. This nation appears now habitually fixed, by character and in|clination, in that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and impove|ri&s;hed &s;y&s;tem. Though formerly more fe|rocious, turbulent, and factious, as during their civil wars, they are now the mo&s;t pliant and ea&s;y to govern of any people we know: &s;o that they would not now know what to do with their liberty, if they had it. And if &s;uch a government could make the good of the people a primary object, they would ere now, and might very &s;afely, have reduced their peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, at lea&s;t to half its pre&s;ent num|ber, and have ea&s;ed the &s;ubject of many
<PB N="460" REF="471">
heavy burdens and regulations. But power is ever unfeeling; and the more ab&s;olute, the more &s;u&s;picious, carele&s;s, and incon|&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>They are likewi&s;e perpetually changing their military &s;y&s;tems and regulations, but I think &s;eldom gain by the change near &s;o much as to make up for the inevitable evils of changing. It is generally wi&s;er to mend the old than to make new, and even the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary changes &s;hould be gra|dual, if po&s;&s;ible. Concerning minutiae, which &s;hould generally be con&s;tant, they are often innovating, and di&s;puting with a degree of heat and animo&s;ity to which we are &s;trangers. Already the Count St. G&mdash;, after labouring mo&s;t patriotically to intro|duce his &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t probably &s;ee its original merits worn down by oppo&s;ition and intrigue, to a few alterations of the lea&s;t importance: and the Count him&s;elf, it &s;eems, mu&s;t &s;oon give up even the&s;e, and the army, to &s;ome other commanders and &s;y&s;tems, perhaps more trifling and ca|pricious. If the cabals and the genius of
<PB N="461" REF="472">
the nation would permit them to retain what is good of his regulations,&mdash;if they could keep only the oeconomical parts, they might gain more than by any other of their changes for a long time pa&s;t. Their troops were certainly getting into what is called very high order, and if well commanded, they might &s;oon be made capable of many things, though not of fatigue and per&s;e|verance.</P>
<P>But it is in the ordnance, as we &s;hould call it, where the greate&s;t changes, and the bittere&s;t controver&s;ies, have lately taken place between Mon&s;. G&mdash;, and his op|ponents, and which have divided the <HI>corps royale</HI> into two inveterate parties. Surely all the other nations together, could not have &s;aid and written &s;o much about &s;hort and long guns, and without deciding any thing.</P>
<P>I am tired with reading the numerous publications on this endle&s;s controver&s;y, and have given it up till &s;ome one &s;hall
<PB N="462" REF="473">
collect the &s;ub&s;tance of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has &s;ince been done by a Captain Scheel.</NOTE>. The experi|ments of either party are not calculated to di&s;cover the truth, but to get the better of their opponents. The French are not na|turally very fit to carry on experiments. That ta&s;k requires a more per&s;evering, im|partial, cool, and philo&s;ophic turn of mind.</P>
<P>You know they have been lately very attentive to their navy, to which, in con&s;equence, I think it behoves us to be very attentive likewi&s;e, and to watch all their operations. The hi&s;tory of what they have done, in this department, &s;ince the time of Louis XIV. and of what they are now doing, would form a curious col|lection, and like them&s;elves, and indeed like mo&s;t other human ideas and in|&s;titutions,&mdash;a mixture of &s;en&s;e and non|&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;ome chief points, they are as far in one extreme as you are in the other.&mdash;
<PB N="463" REF="474">
Their depending, as u&s;ual, more on theory than on practice, while we continue in the contrary extreme, is all characteri&s;tic of the two nations.</P>
<P>The power and expenditure of the mi|litary part, are not &s;ufficiently controlled by the civil; and we know that the com|mon, degrees of human integrity, when uncontrolled, are not to be depended on: in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;ome abu&s;es mu&s;t creep in, and when once introduced, each will bring a crowd of others. Their pre&s;ent marine &s;y&s;tem may not, therefore, be much more la&s;ting and incorruptible, than any of the former.</P>
<P>They place great dependance on certain &s;ea manoeuvres: but military novelties, and their effects, mu&s;t &s;oon be over, be|fore a vigilant enemy. In wars between European powers, &s;uch art or artifice can|not give much durable advantage, nor long overcome real &s;trength. Happily, per|haps, for mankind, we are all now &s;o nearly on a footing, and communicate &s;o
<PB N="464" REF="475">
freely, that any of the arts u&s;ed in war by one power, may be pre&s;ently tran&s;|mitted to the re&s;t, and may be evaded or counteracted, &s;o that all is &s;oon reduced again to the deci&s;ion of actual force, general|&s;hip, and the chances of war.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVI.</HI> The Schools, Military, &amp;c.&mdash;Of the Mona&s;tic Orders and Super&s;tition.</HEAD>
<P>THE modes and places of education are, in every country, worthy of at|tention, and as an officer, you will, of cour&s;e, inquire and take notice of their military &s;chools here. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that you will probably find their volumi|nous regulations, as u&s;ual, to be better on paper than in practice. They plan much better than they execute, which is ju&s;t the contrary, I believe, with us. So that we might, in many ways, learn of each other. We can often borrow their ideas, and im|prove upon them in the execution. We can &s;ometimes execute what they only talk of: with, perhaps, more judgment, and certainly better workmen, we may get more from their books than from their
<PB N="466" REF="477">
practice: but we &s;hould &s;ee both. I hope you will find, with me, that we have been e&s;timating their &s;chools, and &s;chola&s;tic modes of education, a little too high. The&s;e appear to me yet more faulty than our own, either from defect or redundancy. They teach either nothing or too much. We are often &s;urpri&s;ed at the ignorance of &s;ome very decent looking men; and the common people are taught nothing at &s;chool but the &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies of religion. Even their be&s;t places of education, though they may &s;erve to model Frenchmen, are &s;urely improper and in&s;ufficient to form Engli&s;hmen. Men are here to be framed, modelled, and cut to a pattern, and nothing left to nature: it is the bed of Procru&s;tes, where people are to be &s;hortened or length|ened &s;o as to fit it.</P>
<P>I fear we mu&s;t allow that education, for many of the practical and important offices in &s;ociety, is yet very deficient among us: theory and practice are yet far from being &s;ufficiently acquainted. Our idle univer&s;i|ties &s;eem to fit people for few, or no very
<PB N="467" REF="478">
u&s;eful purpo&s;es in life, except the church. Pride, idlene&s;s, or u&s;ele&s;s knowledge, &s;eem to be too frequently the chief acquirements there: and mo&s;t of our other &s;chools, and e&s;pecially boarding-&s;chools and academies about town, are mere expen&s;ive impo&s;i|tions. Our military education has pro|bably been the mo&s;t defective: we have produced but few officers fit to command armies; and tho&s;e few have come from among the cho&s;en number who have had the military ambition and enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;o &s;trong as to make them travel, inquire, and &s;erve, wherever there was any thing to be learned: a Cromwell, a Marlborough, a Wolfe, &amp;c. may be di&s;tingui&s;hed; but the catalogue, if continued, would he too &s;hort for &s;o long a &s;pace of time. Yet, I think, the Engli&s;h character contains as many of the materials as any other, for great gene|rals or great politicians, for I con&s;ider the&s;e two characters as &s;imilar, and indeed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be joined in tho&s;e leaders of mankind;&mdash;<HI>nous &s;ommes de l'&eacute;toffe dout on en fait.</HI> But perhaps an i&s;land cannot pro|duce
<PB N="468" REF="479">
them in &s;uch plenty as a great con|tinent: the want or demand for &s;uch, is probably &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed likewi&s;e by the &s;ecurity of your in&s;ular &s;ituation; and by the nature of your government, which, like your i&s;land, may be left a good deal to it&s;elf, and like a good child, without doing it&s;elf any harm. This French government cares not much about her own &s;ubjects, and &s;eems only anxious to govern the re&s;t of the world, and hence may pro|duce more of tho&s;e called politicians than you, as you are generally much en|gro&s;&s;ed by your internal affairs, and are &s;eldom, I think, well ver&s;ed in foreign politics. Hence, likewi&s;e, probably pro|ceeds the misfortune of your not being al|ways good judges of tho&s;e military and political men you may have, and your not knowing how and where to employ them, according to their talents and characters. Many a Wolfe, and many a Marlborough, may have died in the lower ranks of our &s;ervice. We have not yet employed, nor made a proper u&s;e of, tho&s;e few officers
<PB N="469" REF="480">
pointed out and recommended to us by General Wolfe and Prince Ferdinand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have heard that Prince Ferdinand &s;aid, <Q>The Engli&s;h &s;end me generals proper for commi&s;&s;aries, and commi&s;&s;aries fit for generals.</Q> The pre&s;ent General Royd was then, it &s;eems, one of his commi&s;&s;aries. This anec|dote is worth pre&s;erving, as it characteri&s;es &s;o well our national councils, the &s;peaker, and the per&s;ons meant.</NOTE>; they knew an officer by a kind of in&s;tinct. And as to politicians, you have not, I fear, judged much better. You have &s;ometimes fancied that great lawyers mu&s;t be great politicians, which I fear is not often the ca&s;e; and I &s;hould not have very great hopes of the cabinet that was led or go|verned by them. I mean only to &s;peak generally, and of &s;uch who&s;e character is formed by the habits of their profe&s;&s;ion, in which, I think, the nature and minutiae of the inve&s;tigation may produce a kind of micro&s;copic vi&s;ion, but does not tend to give the habits and velocity of mind, nor to form an eye of &s;ufficient field and &s;cope for a great politician: but we have known good officers from that line, and there are, doubtle&s;s, among them men who&s;e genius and abilities are upon the large&s;t &s;cale, and
<PB N="470" REF="481">
who are beyond the vices and habits of their trade; and &s;ome who are impelled by nature into that path, from other walks of life: &s;ome of the&s;e are often the greate&s;t, the leading characters in mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ions; and we &s;hall find, that almo&s;t every branch of knowledge is indebted to &s;uch inter|lopers for its principal inventions and im|provements.</P>
<P>But I think it may fairly enough be doubt|ed, whether an Alexander, a Cae&s;ar, a Tamerlane, a Mahomet, a Frederic, a great warrior and legi&s;lator, in one, could po&s;&s;ibly be produced within the confines of a modern univer&s;ity, and of an i&s;land: it pro|bably requires more room, and more great objects of employ, for &s;uch minds to ex|pand, and to be gradually wrought up into the habits of thinking and doing great things. Admitting the vulgar idea of &s;ome men being born generals, poets, mechanics, &amp;c. their formation is obviou&s;ly progre&s;|&s;ive. We know that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not a general during his fir&s;t campaign, nor &s;carcely an engineer at the la&s;t: and if
<PB N="471" REF="482">
we knew as much of ancient heroes, we &s;hould probably find the &s;ame progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though this French nation and &s;ociety may form a tolerable &s;chool for &s;ome of our grown gentlemen and ladies, yet we certainly do not better our&s;elves by &s;ending our children to be educated in their country. Nay, I am &s;ometimes quite angry and un|happy about this late pernicious prejudice of Engli&s;h parents, in favour of what they call a French education. The children commonly fall under the care of nuns and friars, who are generally the mo&s;t ignorant and vulgar part of &s;ociety; people inferior to our own &s;ervants and workmen, with more &s;uper&s;tition and le&s;s knowledge. It is only when parents, or &s;ome relation, can accompany the children, that it can be worth while, or &s;hould be thought of. The great object, even of the mo&s;t diligent and be&s;t informed in tho&s;e &s;chool convents, is to convert the children to their own &s;uper|&s;tition. Their whole conduct in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is &s;ecretly directed to that object, which, indeed, is one of the primary in|tentions
<PB N="472" REF="483">
of mo&s;t of the mona&s;tic orders, and of their &s;chools; and &s;aving of &s;ouls, by converting them to their faith, is, with them, a fir&s;t-rate merit, and an indi&s;pen|&s;able obligation.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> that the Engli&s;h government would do more, by effectually excluding the&s;e mona&s;tic peo|ple from their dominions, and particularly from Ireland, than by all their laws again&s;t popery. And I believe, the fir&s;t govern|ment in Europe who &s;hall have re&s;olution to begin the di&s;&s;olution of tho&s;e now burden&s;ome and dangerous fraternities, may find it ea&s;ier than commonly imagin|ed, and other nations will &s;oon follow the example. They are now only popular among a few ignorant devotees, chiefly of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, and are much weakened &s;ince they lo&s;t their potent le|gion, the Je&s;uits, who were, to be &s;ure, the mo&s;t powerful and dangerous, becau&s;e the mo&s;t learned and u&s;eful. This abolition would be a popular mea&s;ure, even in &s;ome Catholic countries, e&s;pecially if care was
<PB N="473" REF="484">
taken not to give jealou&s;y to the re&s;t of the church; many of them would then probably &s;ecretly rejoice at the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In aboli&s;hing the&s;e mona&s;tic orders, and their too numerous convents, perhaps a few of the mo&s;t u&s;eful might be &s;afely enough retained, e&s;pecially as every con|&s;iderable change in &s;ociety &s;hould be as gra|dual as po&s;&s;ible. Humanity, and the world in general, would agree to the pre&s;ervation of that a&s;&s;iduous and benevolent &s;i&s;terhood, who leave their cloi&s;ters, and attend to the mo&s;t painful duties in life, the care of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Since religious wars and di&s;putes have &s;ub&s;ided, in England you &s;eem to have forgot the nature, the real &s;tate and &s;pirit of religion in Europe. It is not &s;o much changed as you &s;uppo&s;e; it is only that, being tired of the &s;ubject, you have cea&s;ed to talk of it; and it is no longer in fa&s;hion: or you fancy that all are become, like your&s;elves, more moderate, rational, to|lerant:&mdash;nothing like it: toleration is &s;till,
<PB N="474" REF="485">
with all the bigotted Roman Catholics, who are yet numerous, a reprobate, here|tical, dete&s;ted doctrine. The bloody in|qui&s;itorial &s;pirit only pretends to &s;leep, and lies ready watching, to be rou&s;ed by the fir&s;t occa&s;ion that may give a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;by any combination of de&s;ign|ing and powerful hypocrites who may chu&s;e to make u&s;e of it. So that religious wars, which you fancy have cea&s;ed for ever, are, on the contrary, I think, ju&s;t as probable as ever. The Prote&s;tants are only &s;aved, like the Turks in Europe, and &s;ome other le&s;&s;er powers, by their real &s;trength, by a kind of balance or jealou&s;y of in|tere&s;ts, and difficulties about dividing the &s;poils; but the conque&s;t is &s;teadily kept in view by the faithful, and particularly by the mona&s;tic or regular orders: and though we may laugh at their folly, I think it is not beyond a po&s;&s;ibility, that a body &s;o well united in opinions and ob|jects, may, by time and accidents, become &s;ufficiently united in intere&s;t, and may ac|cumulate power enough to de&s;troy all li|berty of opinion, and re&s;tore univer&s;al

Hence proceeds not only a want of con|nection, but a growing hatred and animo|&s;ity, a kind of &s;ecret war, founded chiefly on &s;uper&s;tition, between the extremes of &s;o|ciety; and we ought to be thankful we do not oftener &s;ee the wor&s;t effects of this di&s;po&s;ition break forth, from &s;ome acciden|tal &s;parks of mutual offence. To remedy the&s;e evils, is now far from an ea&s;y ta&s;k, &s;ince government has unwi&s;ely given up the religious direction of the minds of men. In education and employment probably now con&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t efficacious means of cure.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVII.</HI> National Emulation, and American War.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Mr. C&mdash;.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT con&s;tant emulation between the French and us, I think has lately been, and is likely to be, of more &s;ervice to them than to us, in &s;ome things. While our young travellers learn of them little el&s;e be&s;ides their language, their fa&s;hions and follies, they are imitating &s;ome of our u&s;eful arts, and may, in time, vie with us in &s;ome trades of importance. Be&s;ides their attempts to imitate our wares a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rouen, and other places; &s;ome coach|makers, and other trades, at Paris, are try|ing to work like ours. They have lately I think, taken from us our old politica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conduct, and are becoming (at lea&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pretended) protectors of freedom. Let us hope we may, in this too, learn ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own again from them, and with more rea|lity, at &s;econd hand.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="490">I travelled with a Spaniard and a French|man, both coming to England to examine our arts and manufactories, and both men of &s;ome practical and u&s;eful knowledge. One circum&s;tance among others, however, I ob&s;erved, which might prevent their in|crea&s;ing their &s;tock of u&s;eful knowledge from ours, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of every thing French. I &s;oon per|ceived they think that nation far before us in every thing. This prejudice in favour of France is becoming very general, I &s;ee, throughout Europe; which of the two is the fir&s;t for indu&s;try, work, ingenuity, &amp;c. have, for &s;ome time, been &s;ubjects of ra|ther general controver&s;y,&mdash;general, becau&s;e it is difficult to avoid taking a part between contending nations: but I think the Engli&s;h party dimini&s;hes daily: <HI>l'Europe devient encore plus Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e.</HI> However, we know it will be long before &s;uch governments as tho&s;e of France and Spain can attract men with capitals, or enable others to rai&s;e them by manufactories; and we know what dif|ficulties they had to encounter in the few they have attempted. Perhaps it would be wi&s;er for them to depend more, as yet, on
<PB N="480" REF="491">
the produce of their lands, and for that purpo&s;e to begin by changing their tenures, taxes, and methods of farming, than at|tempt to force hands and capitals into new employments, while others remain neglect|ed that are of more national importance.</P>
<P>The Marquis de V&mdash;, who is a very &s;en|&s;ible man, has told me, that he now con|&s;iders our fall as certain and inevitable, from our want of wi&s;dom, and even of common &s;en&s;e, about this re&s;i&s;tance in Ame|rica: fir&s;t, in creating it, next, in not over|looking it, and in our oppo&s;ing it at la&s;t with &s;o little political and military &s;kill: that he is &s;orry for it, on account of what his country will lo&s;e, by the want of that rival&s;hip and emulation between us, the &s;ource of &s;o much exertion, and of &s;o much good to both nations; for he thinks we &s;hall fall too low, and not retain &s;ufficient weight and importance to be their competi|tors in any thing. Mu&s;t Carthage then fall? May not we hope that &s;he will yet &s;ur|vive this whole&s;ome check; and exi&s;t, and pro&s;per, even without colonies, tho&s;e mo&s;t expen&s;ive of all cu&s;tomers? May they not,
<PB N="481" REF="492">
in time, become better cu&s;tomers, without the charge of governing them, when both &s;ides &s;hall recover temper enough to pur&s;ue their mutual intere&s;t? Be&s;ides, I believe our rivals here are fully as far gone in the decline as we.</P>
<P>I grant that it is far better for both, and perhaps for all the nations, that France and England &s;hould exi&s;t together, as &s;eparate and nearly equal kingdoms, though we &s;hould go on to hate, and make war on each other. Let us hope the other nations would not fit quiet and &s;ee the one de&s;troy or &s;ubdue the other. Not that I think it impo&s;&s;ible for a great majority of Europe to be wrong, or too &s;upine, or blind to the general intere&s;t: witne&s;s their not forming a junction &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e the Mahome|dan inroads into Europe and Africa, and their permitting the divi&s;ion of Poland.</P>
<P>This American di&s;pute of ours &s;eems warmly to occupy the attention of the whole world, and in a manner which indicates the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t us. They all
<PB N="482" REF="493">
con&s;ider America as already independent, and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition are forming various and intere&s;ted &s;peculations. In ca&s;e of univer|&s;al tyranny in Europe, which may po&s;&s;ibly again be the ca&s;e, in time, by a partition of it among a few overgrown de&s;pots, and then perhaps &s;oon again devoured by one; North America, it is thought, in that ca&s;e, may &s;erve as an a&s;ylum for per&s;ecuted liberty, which may, from thence, reverberate on its per&s;ecutors. But that, as well as many other &s;peculations, are certainly very di&s;tant and doubtful, with a continent &s;o lately, and as yet &s;o thinly inhabited. Even if they &s;hould become completely independent, there cannot probably be any &s;ettled govern|ment there for a long time to come; and in their various &s;truggles, there is no fore&s;ee|ing yet &s;o far into what may be the re&s;ult. If they continue obliged to enter into our weak and corrupt &s;y&s;tems of European politics, and to depend on our divi&s;ions and alliances, their &s;ubjection, or mutual de|&s;truction, will probably be the con&s;equence; and yet without &s;ufficient connection with Europe, they mu&s;t probably decline, or
<PB N="483" REF="494">
thrive much &s;lower. Peopled from thence, they mu&s;t partake of its vices, in addition to their own plentiful &s;tock. Some of the European manners and in&s;titutions, which they have adopted, may not &s;uit with their &s;ituation, and may help to prevent their progre&s;s and their union. Indeed the diffi|culties of reuniting &s;uch a lengthened coun|try, and &s;uch varying intere&s;ts, may long be in&s;urmountable, e&s;pecially when the mo&s;t powerful motives of union, the go|vernment, or enmity of a mother-country, &s;hall be wanting: if they are not wi&s;e enough to make u&s;e of the pre&s;ent motive of union, a common enemy, while it la&s;ts, and by means of the war, e&s;tabli&s;h a go|vernment &s;ufficiently powerful, general, and uniform; a peace may &s;eparate &s;uch ill-connected materials, and finally tear them to pieces.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t part, for us, of this war will be, not the pecuniary lo&s;s and ex|pence, but the ill &s;ucce&s;s and di&s;grace that will probably attend it; and hence our &s;inking in the &s;cale and in the opinion of Europe. The ideas you mention of divid|ing
<PB N="484" REF="495">
our army to attack the country in dif|ferent quarters, that we may be beaten in detail, and e&s;pecially if tho&s;e armies leave their ports, or their <HI>depots,</HI> &s;o far as to &s;hut up or endanger the communication behind them, which we know to have always failed from Xenophon downwards: in &s;hort, the whole original plan of &s;ubduing by force what is by that means rendered un|worthy the increa&s;ed expence of keeping, are all ideas &s;o thoroughly ab&s;urd, ungenerous, tyrannical, or unmilitary, that they mu&s;t entail di&s;grace on tho&s;e who can adopt them. But it is not probable that all your army or navy can adopt them, or be hearty in the cau&s;e; nay, the contrary is &s;uffici|ently notorious; and, indeed, nothing could &s;ave us from eternal di&s;grace but its being pretty well known every where, except in England, that the majority and the be&s;t parts of the nation are again&s;t &s;uch mea|&s;ures: if that majority does not &s;oon pre|vail, your con&s;titution, and your America, will be together lo&s;t. Such are &s;ome of the wild &s;peculations that occur, among a va|riety of others which you may have already heard on this &s;ubject.</P>

till you come to the fore&s;t of Orleans, and even that con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of &s;mall trees and bru&s;h-wood. The town na&s;ty, and infe&s;ted with bugs. Some good hou&s;es, one good &s;treet, and a fine bridge, with long, light, beautiful, elliptic arches. They are repairing their Gothic cathedral here; they began profe&s;&s;edly to pre&s;erve it in the &s;ame old &s;tyle, which is very good, but they cannot keep to their pattern; they are now changing the ta&s;te and architecture.

public &s;pirit in this country,&mdash;few capi|tals to be employed in manufactures, a want of machines, of &s;kill, of exertion: it mu&s;t be long before this nation can rival you as manufacturers: it might be better for you, I think, if they did, and were equally rich and indu&s;trious with your|&s;elves; they would then be better cu&s;tomers than now: if nations were not oppre&s;&s;ed and impeded by their fooli&s;h governments, each of them would probably produce and manufacture what was mo&s;t natural and proper for their country and climate, and the one would &s;upply what was wanted by the other, to the greate&s;t mutual benefit of all. May not we hope to &s;ee governments open their eyes on this &s;ubject? during this inve&s;tigating and enlightened age, as people come to read A. Smith's book: but govern|ments are generally led or advi&s;ed by the little peddling people in trade, who &s;ee no|thing beyond their own little non&s;en&s;ical &s;y&s;tems of monopoly, and are not probably the be&s;t politicians in the &s;tate: indeed, it is yet hard to &s;ay where to find better: the be&s;t remedy would be, for mini&s;ters to

travel and take great pains them&s;elves, and con&s;ult mo&s;t with tho&s;e who have done the &s;ame,&mdash;with tho&s;e who have lived, and have been employed in different countries. If, by chance, a mini&s;ter reads and rea&s;ons him&s;elf into a good &s;y&s;tem, it is probable he knows not the chief part, the way to carry it into execution: a few general rules or principles are ea&s;ily learned; in the ex|ceptions to tho&s;e rules, and in the practice, con&s;i&s;t the difficult le&s;&s;ons. Theory and practice are no where &s;ufficiently acquainted. Power is generally too proud to be taught, and too ignorant to judge: it thinks it can do every thing, and amid&s;t other non&s;en&s;e, vainly fancies it can trim and manage the balance of trade. If governments would let trade alone, it would probably balance it&s;elf much better than they can. If either nations, or individuals, have a mind to ex|pend beyond their income, I fear their go|vernments cannot then prevent them, if they have previou&s;ly taken &s;uch bad care of their education, as to let them once acquire tho&s;e vicious habits.</P>

Mad. Louis here much worth knowing: he is building them a very fine theatre, and means to publi&s;h a particular detail of the work: in great works this &s;hould never be neglected. Mon&s;. L&mdash; thinks he has performed &s;ome things rather new in the cutting, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Garonne is a fine river, and the means of a great trade.

<P>The&s;e magi&s;trates of Bourdeaux propo&s;e to try a tax upon &s;alt, for experiment, meaning to di&s;continue it if found incon|venient,

or not to an&s;wer: they mu&s;t be &s;impletons if they believe it will ever again be di&s;continued. Here is Voltaire's <HI>Aca|demie des moutons rouges;</HI> a nickname it may probably retain (&s;ee <HI>Candide</HI>).</P>
<P>Such are not the places where &s;cience chu&s;es to dwell: &s;he is rarely found to be very nearly allied to commerce, or the love of money; only in England, I think there are &s;ome hopes of her becoming more near|ly allied to trade, as your education mu&s;t &s;urely, in time, be extended and improved, as its importance mu&s;t become evident to a rich and improving nation. Under &s;uch governments as this, even riches produce but little public &s;pirit: indeed, the public, in the&s;e days, is nowhere con&s;idered as it ought to be; and here it is hardly con|&s;idered at all. We have ju&s;t heard the opinion of &s;ome great lawyers and magi|&s;trates again&s;t the public, in the di&s;po&s;al of &s;ome litigated public money, which &s;hews how little they con&s;ider the public good: to &s;ettle the di&s;pute, the money has been given to a convent: fal&s;e and inadequate
<PB N="494" REF="505">
ideas of ju&s;tice, and of its importance, given to the people, are not the lea&s;t of the evils attending a bad government.</P>
<P>About Bourdeaux, I think, are the be&s;t farmers we had yet &s;een in France, e&s;pecial|ly of their vineyards, which are well mana|ged, as are all the other parts of this wine bu&s;ine&s;s: it &s;eems natural to this country, forming at once a flouri&s;hing agriculture, a manufactory, population, and riches. Who|ever wi&s;hes to under&s;tand all the wine bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and its cultivation, &s;hould come to this country: it is wonderful the Spaniards do not come here to learn tho&s;e branches, which might be made of &s;uch con&s;equence to them.</P>
<P>Government, vainly fearing that too much land may be turned to wine, attempt to make the farmers turn more to corn; better let them alone, for they are the be&s;t judges in the&s;e matters: but power is very apt to be over-wi&s;e. This wine farming is to be &s;ure a kind of lottery, which tempts with great prizes, and is &s;ubject to &s;till greater lo&s;&s;es,
<PB N="495" REF="506">
like mining, or like our hop-farming: but &s;till the be&s;t way, I believe, is to let the farmers alone, they will be&s;t di&s;cover and pur&s;ue their own intere&s;t: but, alas! how few governments know how to do this, and let their &s;ubjects alone? No one coun|try can produce every thing; the attempt would not tend to improve, but to impede or force nature, who wi&s;ely &s;eems to intend that men and nations &s;hould want, &s;hould &s;upply and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. An entire inde|pendence on others, would be an impracti|cable cynical &s;oleci&s;m in human policy: it would &s;top the &s;ources of pro&s;perity, by dimini&s;hing the motives to indu&s;try, and occa&s;ion a gradual decline: a &s;y&s;tem nearly adopted by Spain, and afterwards too much imitated by other nations.</P>
<P>Such, in this la&s;t letter you are to expect from France, are the remarks which I have collected from my notes; tho&s;e, with various names, numbers, and abbreviations, help me to recal numerous other connected ideas and occurrences, which would neither be ea&s;y to communicate, nor perhaps worth it, to any
<PB N="496" REF="507">
other per&s;on: and it can hardly be worth writing much about tho&s;e parts that we only run through. U&s;eful knowledge and re|flections require time and attention, and can only be produced by a re&s;idence.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of the&s;e epi&s;tles may furni&s;h you with leading hints and marks to &s;teer by, as well as longer and more laboured accounts: the mo&s;t explicit ought not to &s;ave you any nece&s;&s;ary labour, nor could they, perhaps, lead you more directly to your object, which is the point of import|ance. Could we learn to e&s;timate things according to their real value, and be content with what is really u&s;eful; what time might be &s;aved! and how much farther might we go! You may, I hope, find lei&s;ure to en|quire farther into particulars, into the real &s;tate and cau&s;es of many more things in this country; and &s;tudy their laws, hi&s;tory, government, arts, manners, &amp;c. on the &s;pot: but do it with judgment and &s;election, and to &s;ave time,&mdash;<HI>bornez vous &agrave; l'utile &amp; &agrave; l'applicable.</HI></P>
