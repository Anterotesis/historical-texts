<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>Of the State of</HI> RELIGION <HI>from the Revolution</HI> 1689 <HI>to the death of King George</HI> II. 1760.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM had been invited to England by a coalition of parties, united by a common &s;en&s;e of danger; but this tie being broken, they flew a&s;under, and each re&s;umed its original pre|judices. Their mutual jealou&s;y and rancour revived, and was heated by di&s;pute into intemperate zeal and enthu&s;ia&s;m. Tho&s;e, who at fir&s;t acted from principles of patrioti&s;m, were in&s;en&s;ibly warmed into partizans; and King William &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of a faction. As he had been bred a Calvini&s;t, and always expre&s;&s;ed an abhorrence of &s;piritual per&s;ecution, the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters con&s;idered him as their peculiar Protector, and entered into his intere&s;ts with the mo&s;t zealous fervour and a&s;&s;iduity. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the friends of the church became jealous of his proceed|ings, and employed all their influence, fir&s;t in oppo&s;ing his elevation to the throne, and afterwards in thwart|ing his mea&s;ures. William began his reign with a pro|clamation for confirming all Prote&s;tants in the offices
<PB N="2" REF="3">which they enjoyed on the fir&s;t day of December. Having cho&s;e his Council, they re&s;olved to convert the convention into a parliament, that the new &s;ettlement might be &s;trengthened by a legal &s;anction, which was now &s;uppo&s;ed to be wanting, as the a&s;&s;embly had not been convoked by the King's writ of &s;ummons. The experiment of a new election being deemed too hazard|ous, the Council determined that the King, by vir|tue of his own authority, &s;hould change the conven|tion into a parliament, by going to the hou&s;e of Peers, with the u&s;ual &s;tate of a Sovereign, and pronouncing a &s;peech from the throne to both hou&s;es: which ex|pedient was accordingly practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whatever promi&s;es William had made, and what|ever &s;entiments of re&s;pect he entertained for the church of England, he &s;eemed now in a great mea&s;ure alienated from it, by the oppo&s;ition he had met with from its members, particularly from tho&s;e Prelates
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were William Sancroft Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Ro|bert Frampton Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, Francis Turner Bi&s;hop of Ely, William Lloyd Bi&s;hop of Norwich, Thomas Ken Bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, Thomas White Bi&s;hop of Peterborough, John Lake Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, and William Thomas Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter. Among the temporal Peers, Henry Cave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di&s;h Duke of Newca&s;tle, Henry Hyde Earl of Clarendon, Edward-Henry Lee Earl of Litchfield, John Cecil Earl of Exeter, William Pa&s;ton Earl of Yarmouth, with the Lords Griffin and Stawel, al&s;o refu&s;ed to &s;wear to William and Mary.</NOTE> who had, by ab&s;enting them&s;elves from the parliament, and re|fu&s;ing the oaths, plainly di&s;owned his title. He there|fore re&s;olved to mortify the church, and gratify his own friends at the &s;ame time, by removing the ob&s;tacles af|fixed to non-conformity, that all Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be rendered capable of enjoying and exerci&s;ing civil employments. He recommended the e&s;tabli&s;hing a new oath, in lieu of tho&s;e of allegiance and &s;upremacy. It was propo&s;ed to abrogate the old, and appoint new oaths, by which the &s;acramental te&s;t was declared un|nece&s;&s;ary to render any per&s;on capable of enjoying
<PB N="3" REF="4">any office or employment. This was however reject|ed by a great majority in the hou&s;e of Lords. Another propo&s;al for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, though in different terms, met with the &s;ame fate. The&s;e fruitle&s;s efforts, in fa|vour of Di&s;&s;enters, augmented the prejudice of the churchmen again&s;t William, who would have willing|ly compromi&s;ed the difference by excu&s;ing the clergy from the oaths, provided the Di&s;&s;enters might be ex|empted from a &s;acramental te&s;t. But this was deemed the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the propo&s;al was rejected. The church-party in the hou&s;e of Lords moved, that in&s;tead of obliging the clergy to take the oaths, the King &s;hould be empowered to ten|der them; and in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, they &s;hould in|cur the penalty, becau&s;e deprivation, or the appre|hen&s;ion of it, might make them de&s;perate, and excite them to form de&s;igns again&s;t the government. After a long and warm debate, all the mitigation that could be obtained, was a clau&s;e to inve&s;t the King with a power to indulge any twelve clergymen, deprived by virtue of the act, with a third part of their benefices during plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The King, though baffled in his de&s;ign again&s;t the &s;acramental te&s;t,
<NOTE><HI>Act for tole|ration.</HI></NOTE> re&s;olved to indulge the Di&s;&s;enters with a toleration; and a bill for this purpo&s;e, was, after &s;ome debate, pa&s;&s;ed into a law, under the title of <HI>An act for exempt|ing their Maje&s;ties Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects di&s;&s;enting from the penalties of certain laws.</HI> It enacted, that none of the penal laws &s;hould be con&s;trued to extend to tho&s;e Di&s;|&s;enters who &s;hould take the oaths to the pre&s;ent go|vernment, and &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration of the thirtieth year in the reign of Charles II. provided, that they &s;hould hold no private a&s;&s;emblies or conventicles with the doors &s;hut; and that nothing &s;hould be con&s;trued to exempt them from the payment of tithes or other parochial duties. That in ca&s;e of being cho&s;en
<PB N="4" REF="5">into the offices of con&s;tables, over&s;eers, churchwardens, &amp;c. and of &s;crupling to take the oaths annexed to &s;uch offices, they &s;hould be allowed to execute the employ|ment by deputy. That the preachers and teachers in congregations of di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants, who &s;hall take the oaths, &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration, together with all the articles of religion, except the thirty fourth, and the two &s;ucceeding articles, and part of the twentieth, &s;hould be exempted from the penalties decreed again&s;t Non-conformi&s;ts, as well as from &s;erving upon Juries, or acting in pari&s;h-offices; yet all Ju&s;tices of the Peace were empowered to require &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters to &s;ub&s;cribe the declarations, and take the oaths; and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al to commit them to pri&s;on, without bail or mainprize. The &s;ame indulgence was extended to Anabapti&s;ts, and even to Quakers, on their &s;olemn promi&s;e, before God, to be faithful to the King and Queen; and the latter's a&s;&s;enting by profe&s;&s;ion and a&s;|&s;everation to tho&s;e articles which the others ratified upon oath: they were likewi&s;e required to profe&s;s their belief in the trinity and the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>A bill of comprehen&s;ion had been brought into the hou&s;e of Peers, by which moderate Di&s;&s;enters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted into eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices. This was extremely agreeable to the King, who had the &s;cheme of comprehen&s;ion very much at heart. In the progre&s;s of the bill &s;everal warm debates aro&s;e, &s;ome of which were carried in favour of the Di&s;&s;enters: however the bill was re|jected by the Commons, after it had pa&s;&s;ed the Lords with great difficulty. All the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t it could not prevent the King from pro&s;ecuting the &s;cheme. He granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal to ten Bi&s;hops, and twenty dignitaries of the church, authori&s;ing them to meet from time to time in the Jeru&s;alem-chamber, to prepare &s;uch alterations of the liturgy and canons, and &s;uch propo&s;als for the reformation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, as might mo&s;t con|duce <PB N="5" REF="6">to the good order, edification, and uniting of the church; and tend to reconcile all religious diffe|rences among the Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of the kingdom. However, all William's endeavours at this time proved ineffectual.</P>
<P>A. D. 1691.] The Bi&s;hop of Ely's being accu&s;ed of having been concerned in a con&s;piracy with Lord Pre&s;ton and others, furni&s;hed the King with a plau&s;ible pretence for filling up the &s;ees vacated by the depriva|tion of the Nonjuring Bi&s;hops. The deprived Bi&s;hops had been given to under&s;tand, that an act of parliament might be obtained to excu&s;e them from taking the oaths, provided they would perform their epi&s;copal functions; but as they declined this expedient, the King now re&s;olved to &s;upply their places. Accord|ingly he conferred the vacant &s;ee of Canterbury, Glou|ce&s;ter, Ely, Norwich, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, Chiche&s;ter and Worce&s;ter, on Dr John Tillot&s;on, Edward Fowler, Simon Patrick, John Moore, Richard Kidder, Richard Cumberland, Robert Grove, and Ed|ward Stillingfleet. Several of the inferior clergy had likewi&s;e &s;acrificed their benefices to their &s;cruples of con&s;cience with regard to taking the oaths, &s;o contrary to tho&s;e they had taken to King James, and were therefore denominated <HI>Nonjurors;</HI> but the&s;e were but a &s;mall number in proportion to tho&s;e who complied, though they declared that they took the oaths in no other &s;en&s;e than that of a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the powers that were; affirming that the legi&s;lature had allowed the di&s;tinction of a King <HI>de facto</HI> and a King <HI>de jure,</HI> as they had dropped the word <HI>rightful,</HI> when the form of the oath was under debate.</P>
<P>A. D. 1694.] This year died, on November 22, Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, greatly regretted by the King and Queen; and generally lamented by the public, as a pattern of elegance, ingenuity, meekne&s;s, charity, and moderation. Queen Mary did not long &s;urvive him:
<PB N="6" REF="7">&s;he was taken ill of the &s;mall pox, and died on De|cember 28, in the thirty-third year of her age, and the &s;ixth of her reign. She was a zealous Prote&s;tant, &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in all the duties of devotion, of an even temper, and calm, mild conver&s;ation. She was ruffled by no pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eems to have been a &s;tranger to the emotions of natural affection; for &s;he a&s;cended, without compunction, the throne from which her father had been depo&s;ed, and treated her &s;i&s;ter, the Prince&s;s Anne, as an alien to her blood.</P>
<P>A. D. 1698.] At this period, Dr. Thomas Bray, an active divine, formed a plan for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign countries. Mi&s;&s;ionaries, catechi&s;ms, liturgies, and other books for the in&s;truction of igno|rant people, were &s;ent to the Engli&s;h colonies in Ame|rica. This laudable de&s;ign was &s;upported by voluntary contribution; and the bill having been brought into the hou&s;e of Commons for the better di&s;covery of e&s;tates given to &s;uper&s;titious u&s;es, Dr. Bray pre&s;ented a petition, praying, that &s;ome part of the e&s;tates might be &s;et apart for the propagation of the reformed reli|gion, in Maryland, Virginia, and the Leeward I&s;lands. At this time likewi&s;e a Society for the Reformation of Manners was formed, under the King's countenance and encouragement. Con&s;iderable collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read prayers at certain hours in places of public wor&s;hip, and admi|ni&s;ter the &s;acrament every Sunday.</P>
<P>A. D. 1700.] The parliament having received a pe|tition from the Lanca&s;hire clergy, complaining of the in&s;olence and attempts of Popi&s;h prie&s;ts, a bill was brought in, decreeing a further reward to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould di&s;cover and convict Popi&s;h prie&s;ts and Je|&s;uits; and perpetual impri&s;onment for tho&s;e convicted on the oath of one or more witne&s;&s;es. It enacted, that no per&s;on born after the twenty-fir&s;t day of March next en&s;uing, being a Papi&s;t, &s;hould be capable of in|heriting any title of honour or e&s;tate within the
<PB N="7" REF="8">kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed; and that no Papi&s;t &s;hould be capable of purcha&s;ing any lands, tenements or he|reditaments, either in his own name, or in the name of other per&s;on in tru&s;t for him. After &s;ome alterations it was &s;ent up to the Lords, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, contrary to the expectation of tho&s;e who pro&s;e|cuted the mea&s;ure, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the King was a favourer of Papi&s;ts. However the bill was deficient in nece&s;&s;ary clau&s;es to enforce execution; &s;o that the law was very little regarded in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>A. D. 1701.] A bill was this year brought into the parliament for abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales (the &s;on of James II. who died the &s;ixteenth of Sep|tember at St. Germain) and &s;wearing to his Maje&s;ty by the title of rightful and lawful King, and his heirs, according to the act of &s;ettlement. Warm debates aro&s;e upon the que&s;tion, "Whether the oath &s;hould be impo&s;ed, or voluntary?" And, at length, it was carried for impo&s;ition by the majority of but one voice.</P>
<P>A. D. 1702.] King William's health had been for &s;ome time very much impaired, and a fall from his hor&s;e, by which his collar-bone was fractured, probably ha&s;tened his end. He died on March 8, in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. In courage, fortitude, and equanimity, he rivalled the mo&s;t eminent warriors of antiquity. He was religious, temperate, a &s;tranger to violent pa&s;&s;ions, and might have pa&s;&s;ed for an excellent Prince, had he never a&s;cended the throne of Great Britain, after which he was oppo&s;ed in the mo&s;t generous attempts for the good of the public, and through his whole reign was the &s;acrifice to the faction and parties among&s;t the people he had &s;aved from ruin.</P>
<P>A. D. 1702.] Anne Prince&s;s of Denmark, daughter of James II. by his fir&s;t wife, a&s;cended the throne upon the decea&s;e of William, in the thirty-eighth year of her
<PB N="8" REF="9">age, to the general &s;atisfaction of all parties. Even the Jacobites &s;eemed plea&s;ed with her elevation, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that, as in all probability, &s;he would leave no heirs of her own body, the dictates of natural affection would induce her to alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in favour of her own brother. She had been taught to cheri&s;h warm &s;entiments of the Tories, whom &s;he con|&s;idered as the friends of monarchy. Her inclination for them plainly appeared in her choice of mini&s;ters; which were mo&s;tly of that party. The Queen &s;um|moned a new parliament, which met on October 20. The Commons of this parliament had nothing more at heart than a bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity. On November 4, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e. In the preamble all per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake was condemned: neverthele&s;s it enacted, that all tho&s;e who had taken the &s;acrament and te&s;t for offices of tru&s;t, or the magi&s;tracy of corporations, and after|wards frequented any meeting of Di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould be di&s;abled from holding their employments, pay a fine of five hundred pounds, and five pounds a day for the time in which they continued to act in their em|ployments, after having been at any &s;uch meeting. But after &s;everal warm debates the bill mi&s;carried. A bill was brought into the lower hou&s;e, granting another year's con&s;ideration to tho&s;e who had not taken the oath of abjuration. The Lords added three clau&s;es, im|porting that tho&s;e per&s;ons, who &s;hould take the oath within the limited time, might return to their benefi|ces and employments, unle&s;s they &s;hould be already legally filled: that any per&s;on endeavouring to defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, as now limited by law, &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea&s;on: and that the oath of abjuration &s;hould be impo&s;ed on the &s;ubjects of Ireland. The Commons made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t clau&s;e; but, at length, the que&s;tion being put, Whether they &s;hould agree to the amendments? it was carried in the affirmative by one voice.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">The two hou&s;es of convocation, which were &s;um|moned with the parliament, bore a &s;trong affinity with that a&s;&s;embly, by the different intere&s;ts which prevailed in the upper and lower. The la&s;t, in imitation of the Commons, was de&s;irous of branding the preceding reign; and it was with great difficulty that they con|curred with the prelates in an addre&s;s of congratula|tion to her Maje&s;ty. The lower hou&s;e de&s;ired, in an application to Thomas Teni&s;on Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, and his &s;uffragans, that the matters in di&s;pute concerning the manner of &s;ynodical proceedings, and the right of the lower hou&s;e to hold intermediate a&s;|&s;emblies, might be taken into con&s;ideration, and &s;peedily determined. The Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed, that, in the intervals of &s;e&s;&s;ions, the lower hou&s;e might appoint committees to prepare matters; and when bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be brought regularly before them, that they &s;hould have &s;ufficient time to &s;it and deliberate on the &s;ubject. This did not &s;atisfy the lower hou&s;e: and the prelates refu&s;ed to depart from the Archbi&s;hop's right of proroguing the whole convocation, with con&s;ent of his &s;uffragans. The lower hou&s;e propo&s;ed to refer the controver&s;y to the Queen's deci&s;ion: but the Bi&s;hops declined this expedient, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the epi&s;co|pal authority, and the Archbi&s;hop's pre&s;idency. The lower hou&s;e, having incurred the imputation of favouring Pre&s;bytery, by this oppo&s;ition to the Bi|&s;hops, entered in their books a declaration, ac|knowledging the order of Bi&s;hops as &s;uperior to Pre&s;|byters, and to be a divine apo&s;tolical in&s;titution. Then they de&s;ired the Bi&s;hops, in an addre&s;s, to con|cur in &s;ettling the doctrine of the divine apo&s;tolical right of Epi&s;copacy, that it might be a &s;tanding rule of the church. They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented a petition to the Queen, complaining, that, in the convocation called in the year 1700, after an interruption of ten years, &s;everal que&s;tions having ari&s;en concerning the rights and liberties of the lower hou&s;e, the Bi&s;hops had
<PB N="10" REF="11">refu&s;ed a verbal conference; and, afterwards, declined a propo&s;al to &s;ubmit the di&s;pute to her Maje&s;ty's deter|mination. They therefore fled to her Maje&s;ty for protec|tion, begging &s;he would call the que&s;tion into her own royal audience. The Queen promi&s;ed to con&s;ider the petition, and ordered their council to examine the af|fair, how it con&s;i&s;ted with law or cu&s;tom. Whether their report was unfavourable to the lower hou&s;e, or the Queen was willing to encourage the divi&s;ion, no other an&s;wer was made to their addre&s;s. The&s;e con|te&s;ts produced divi&s;ions through the whole body of the clergy, who ranged them&s;elves in different factions, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of <HI>High Church</HI> and <HI>Low Church.</HI> The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tories; and the other included tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed revolution-principles, and recommended moderation towards the Di&s;&s;enters. At pre&s;ent, however, the Tories, both in church and &s;tate, triumphed in the favour of their So|vereign.</P>
<P>A. D. 1703.] The bill again&s;t occa&s;ional confor|mity was revived this year in the hou&s;e of Commons. In the new draught however the penalties were lowered, and the &s;everal clau&s;es mitigated. After &s;everal debates it pa&s;&s;ed; and was &s;ent up to the Lords. It was op|po&s;ed by a &s;mall majority of the Bi&s;hops, and particu|larly by Burnet Bi&s;hop of Sarum, who exclaimed a|gain&s;t it as a &s;cheme to &s;et the church and Prote&s;tants at variance: and, the que&s;tion being put for a &s;econd reading, it was carried in the negative.</P>
<P>A. D. 1704.] On February 7, the Queen ordered Secretary Hedges to tell the hou&s;e of Commons,
<NOTE><HI>Fir&s;t fruits and tenths granted to the poor clergy.</HI></NOTE> that &s;he had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor clergy: that &s;he would grant her whole revenue ari&s;ing out of the fir&s;t fruits and tenths, as far as it &s;hould become free from incumbrance, as an augmen|tation of their maintenance: and that, the hou&s;e of Commons could find any method by which her inten|tion
<PB N="11" REF="12">to the poor clergy might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage to the public, and acceptable to her Maje&s;ty. The Commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to alienate this branch of the re|venue, and create a corporation by charter, to direct the application of it to the u&s;es propo&s;ed: they likewi&s;e repealed the &s;tatute of mortmain, &s;o far as to allow all men to bequeathe by will, or grant by deed, any &s;um they &s;hould think fit to give towards the augmentation of benefices. Addre&s;&s;es of thanks, from all the cler|gy of England, were pre&s;ented to her Maje&s;ty for her gracious bounty. But very little regard was paid to Gilbert Burnet Bi&s;hop of Sarum, although the Queen declared that Prelate author of the project
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Charles Le&s;lie, in his la&s;t letter to Bi&s;hop Burnet, gives the true ri&s;e of this project in favour of the poor clergy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1705.] Some debates having pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Lords upon the &s;uppo&s;ed dangers to which, the Tories affirmed, the church was expo&s;ed, the que&s;|tion was put, Whether the church was in danger? and carried in the negative by a great majority. Then the hou&s;e re&s;olved, that the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which was re&s;cued from the extreme&s;t danger by King William III. of glorious memory, is now, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, under the happy reign of her Maje&s;ty, in a mo&s;t &s;afe and flouri&s;hing condition; and that whoever goes about to &s;ugge&s;t or in&s;inuate that the church is in danger, under her Maje&s;ty's admini&s;tra|tion, is an enemy to the Queen, church, and the king|dom. The Commons concurred in this determination, and joined the Lords in an addre&s;s to the Queen, com|municating this re&s;olution, be&s;eeching her to take ef|fectual mea&s;ures for making it public; and al&s;o for puni&s;hing the authors and &s;preaders of the &s;editious and &s;candalous reports of the church's being in danger. The convocation, in&s;tead of imitating the union and harmony of the parliament, revived the former divi|&s;ions,
<PB N="12" REF="13">and the two hou&s;es &s;eemed to act with more de|termined rancour again&s;t each other. The upper hou&s;e having drawn up a warm addre&s;s to the Queen, for her affectionate care of the church, the lower hou&s;e refu&s;ed to concur; nor would they give any rea&s;on for their di&s;&s;ent. They prepared another in a different &s;train, which was rejected by the Archbi&s;hop. In con&s;e|quence of this di&s;&s;ention the addre&s;s was dropped, and a &s;top put to all further communication of the two hou&s;es. The Dean of Peterborough prote&s;ted again&s;t the irregularities of the lower hou&s;e. The Queen, in a letter to the Archbi&s;hop, &s;ignified her re&s;olution to maintain her &s;upremacy, and the due &s;ubordination of Pre&s;byters to Bi&s;hops. She expre&s;&s;ed her hope that he and his &s;uffragans &s;hould act conformably to her re&s;olution, in which ca&s;e they might be a&s;&s;ured of the continuance of her favour and protection. She re|quired him to impart this declaration to the Bi&s;hops and clergy, and to prorogue the convocation to &s;uch time as &s;hould appear mo&s;t convenient. When he communicated this letter to the lower hou&s;e, the mem|bers were not a little confounded; neverthele&s;s they would not comply with the prorogation, but continued to &s;it in defiance of her Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A. D. 1706.] The union between England and Scot|land, which had been &s;o often attempted in vain, was this year ratified by the Queen and the parliaments of both nations, though not without a &s;trong oppo&s;ition, e&s;pecially on the part of the Scotch. Before the Eng|li&s;h parliament began to inve&s;tigate the articles of the Union, the hou&s;e of Lords, at the in&s;tance of the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, brought in a bill for the &s;ecurity of the church of England, to be in&s;erted as an e&s;&s;ential and fundamental part of that treaty. It pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent, and the Union of the two kingdoms commenced on May 1, 1707.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">A. D. 1707.] The lower hou&s;e of convocation &s;till continued to wrangle with their &s;uperiors; and, though they joined the upper hou&s;e in a congratulatory addre&s;s to the Queen, on the &s;ucce&s;s of her arms, they re&s;ol|ved to make application to the hou&s;e of Commons a|gain&s;t the Union. The Queen, being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, de&s;ired the Archbi&s;hop to prorogue them for three weeks, before the expiration whereof the act of Union had pa&s;&s;ed in parliament. The lower hou&s;e de|livered a repre&s;entation to the Bi&s;hops, in which they affirmed, no &s;uch prorogation had ever been ordered during the &s;itting of parliament. The Bi&s;hops found, in their records, &s;everal precedents of &s;uch prorogations, and a great many in&s;tances of the convocation's having &s;at &s;ometimes when the parliament was di&s;&s;olved. The Queen, informed of the&s;e proceedings, wrote a letter to the Archbi&s;hop, intimating that &s;he looked upon the lower hou&s;e as guilty of an inva&s;ion of her royal &s;upremacy: and that, if any thing of the &s;ame nature &s;hould be attempted for the future, &s;he would u&s;e &s;uch means of puni&s;hing offenders as the law warranted. The Prolocutor ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the convoca|tion, the Archbi&s;hop pronounced &s;entence of contu|macy again&s;t him: and the lower hou&s;e, in a prote&s;ta|tion, declared this &s;entence unlawful, and altogether null. Neverthele&s;s, the Prolocutor made a full &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, with which the Archbi&s;hop was &s;atisfied; and the &s;entence was repealed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Three Cami&s;ars, or Prote&s;tants, from the Cevennois, having made their e&s;cape and repaired to London, acquired about this time the appellation of French Prophets, from their enthu&s;ia&s;tic ge&s;ticulations, effu&s;ions, and convul&s;ions; and even formed a &s;ect of their country|men. The French refugees, &s;candalized at their behaviour, and authori&s;ed by Henry Compton, Bi&s;hop of London, as Superior of the French congregations, re&s;olved to enquire into the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e pretended Prophets, who&s;e names were Elias Marion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage: and they were declared impo&s;tors and counterfeits. Notwith&s;tanding this deci&s;ion, which was con|firmed by the Bi&s;hops, they continued their a&s;&s;emblies in Soho, un|der the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacy. They reviled the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; they denounced judgments again&s;t the city of London, and the whole Briti&s;h nation; and publi&s;hed their predictions, compo&s;ed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were pro&s;ecuted at the expence of the French churches, as di&s;turbers of the public peace, and fal&s;e prophets. They were &s;entenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, and &s;tand twice on a &s;caffold, with papers on their brea&s;ts denoting their offence: a &s;en|tence which was executed accordingly at Charing-cro&s;s and the Royal Exchange.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">A. D. 1709.] On the 13th of December, Mr. Dol|ben made a complaint to the hou&s;e of Commons of two &s;ermons, preached, and publi&s;hed, by Dr. Henry Sa|cheverel, Rector of St. Saviour's in Southwark, as containing po&s;itions contrary to revolution-principles, to the pre&s;ent government, and the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. Dolben's complaint was &s;econded by Sir Peter King and other members: and the &s;ermons being read, were voted &s;candalous and &s;editious libels. Sacheverel, being brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, owned him&s;elf the author of both: and the Doctor being ordered to withdraw, the hou&s;e re&s;olved he &s;hould be impeached of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours, and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the hou&s;e of Lords, in the name of all the Commons of England. A committee was appointed to draw up articles, and Sacheverel was taken into cu&s;tody. Being impeached at the bar of the upper hou&s;e, he petitioned that he might be admitted to bail; but this indulgence was refu&s;ed, and the Commons &s;eemed bent upon pro&s;e|cuting him with &s;uch &s;everity as gave di&s;gu&s;t to men of moderate principles. Mean while the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the Whigs had form|ed a de&s;ign to pull down the church; and that this pro&s;ecution was intended to try their &s;trength, before they would proceed openly to the execution of their project. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were &s;upported, and even credited by &s;ome part of the clergy; who did not fail to alarm and inflame their hearers; while emi&s;&s;aries were
<PB N="15" REF="16">employed to rai&s;e a ferment among the populace. The articles again&s;t Sacheveral being exhibited
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ub&s;tance of the articles again&s;t the Doctor was, 1. That he had &s;ugge&s;ted, and maintained, that the nece&s;&s;ary means u&s;ed to bring about the <HI>revolution</HI> were odious and unju&s;tifiable. 2. That the <HI>act of toleration</HI> was unrea&s;onable, and the allowance of it unwar|rantable. 3. That the church of England was in a &s;tate of great peril and adver&s;ity under her Maje&s;ty's admini&s;tration. 4. That her Maje&s;ty's admini&s;tration, both in eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil affairs, tended to the de&s;truction of the con&s;titution, &amp;c. The&s;e articles were drawn from a &s;ermon the Doctor had preached at the a&s;&s;izes at Derby, on Augu&s;t 15, and another he had preached at St. Paul's before Sir Samuel Garrard Lord Mayor of London, on November 5, this year.</NOTE>, his per|&s;on was committed to the Deputy U&s;her of the Black Rod; and the Lords admitted him to bail: and ap|pointed February 27 for his trial in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</P>
<P>This extraordinary trial engaged the attention of the whole kingdom. It la&s;ted three weeks, during which all other bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended; and the Queen her|&s;elf was every day pre&s;ent, though in quality of a pri|vate &s;pectator. A va&s;t number of people attended Sa|cheverel every day to and from We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, &s;triving to ki&s;s his hand, and praying for his deliverance, as if he had been a martyr or confe&s;&s;or. The Queen's &s;edan was be&s;et by the populace, exclaiming, "God ble&s;s your Maje&s;ty and the church. We hope your Maje&s;ty is for Dr. Sacheverel." When the Doctor's council had fini&s;hed his defence, he him&s;elf recited a &s;peech, wherein he &s;olemnly ju&s;tified his intentions to|wards the Queen and her government; and &s;poke in re&s;pectful terms of the revolution, and the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He maintained the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;t|ance in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, as a maxim of the church in which he was educated; and, by many pathetical expre&s;&s;ions, endeavoured to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the audience. He was &s;urrounded by the Queen's chaplains, who encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church; and he was privately favoured by the Queen her&s;elf, who could not but reli&s;h a doc|trine
<PB N="16" REF="17">&s;o well calculated for the &s;upport of regal autho|rity. After ob&s;tinate di&s;putes, and much virulent al|tercation, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of &s;eventeen voices; but four and thirty Peers entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of the trial, Thomas Earl of Wharton ob&s;erved, that if the revolution was not lawful, many in the hou&s;e of Peers, and many others, were guilty of blood, murder, rapine, and inju&s;tice; and that the Queen her&s;elf was no lawful Sovereign, &s;ince that the be&s;t title &s;he had to the crown was her parliamentary title founded upon the revolution. The Earl of Scarborough &s;aid, that the revo|lution was a nice point, and above the law: and Hooper, Bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, allowed that the revolution was not to be boa&s;ted of, nor made a precedent, and tho&s;e who examined it too nicely were no friends to it. The Duke of Leeds di&s;tingui&s;hed between re|&s;i&s;tance and revolution; for had not the la&s;t &s;ucceeded, it would certainly have been rebellion, &s;ince he knew of no other but heredi|tary right. Burnet, Bi&s;hop of Sarum, who was no friend to Sache|verel, and remarkable for an accidental ab&s;ence of mind and unguard|ed expre&s;&s;ion, affirmed, that the Doctor, in reflecting upon the Queen's mini&s;ters, had &s;o well marked a Peer there pre&s;ent [the Earl of S&mdash;nd&mdash;d] by the epithet of Volpone, in one of his &s;ermons, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take him. Some of the young Peers could not help laughing at this unde&s;igned &s;arca&s;m upon the Lord Trea&s;urer, and exclaimed, "Name him, name him!" but the Chancellor interrupted, declaring, that no Peer was obliged to &s;ay more than he &s;hould think proper.</NOTE>. He was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years: his two &s;ermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the com|mon hangman, in pre&s;ence of the Lord Mayor, and the two Sheriffs of London and Middle&s;ex. The lenity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon Sacheverel, which was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the dread of popular re&s;ent|ment, his friends con&s;idered as a victory obtained over a Whig faction, and they celebrated their triumph with bonfires and illuminations.</P>
<P>The Queen now &s;o apparently favoured the Tories, that the Whig mini&s;try were entirely removed, and their places &s;upplied by the other party. There was not one Whig left in any office of &s;tate, except the Duke of Marlborough: and he was greatly on the
<PB N="17" REF="18">decline in the Queen's favour. That the triumph of the Tories might be more complete, her Maje&s;ty di&s;|&s;olved the Whig parliament, after &s;uch precautions were taken, as could not fail to influence the new election, in favour of the high-church party. To this end nothing &s;o effectually contributed as did the trial of Sacheverel, who was u&s;ed as a tool to wind and turn the pa&s;&s;ions of the vulgar. Having been pre|&s;ented to a benefice in North Wales, he went in pro|ce&s;&s;ion to that country with all the pomp and magni|ficence of a &s;overeign Prince. He was &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and divers noblemen: and was received in &s;everal towns, by the magi&s;trates of the corporation in their formalities, and often attended by a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. No|thing was heard but the cry of "the church and Dr. Sacheverel." The clergy were actuated by a &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;pread through all ranks and de|grees of people, and had &s;uch an effect upon the elections of the new parliament, that few were returned as members but &s;uch as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t the Whig admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>A. D 1711] The hou&s;e of Commons, in order to demon&s;trate their attachment to the church, in con|&s;equence of an addre&s;s from the lower hou&s;e of con|vocation, and a quickening me&s;&s;age from the Queen, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for building fifty new churches in the &s;uburbs of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and appropriated for this purpo&s;e the duty upon coals, which had been granted for the building of St. Paul's cathedral. Of the convocation, which was a&s;&s;embled with the new parliament, the lower hou&s;e cho&s;e Dr. Francis Atter|bury for their prolocutor. He was an enterpri&s;ing eccle&s;ia&s;tic, of exten&s;ive learning, acute talents, violently attached to Tory principles, and intimately connected with the prime mini&s;ter Robert Harley, lately created Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer; &s;o that he di|rected all the proceedings in the lower hou&s;e of convo|cation

<PB N="18" REF="21">in concert with that mini&s;ter. The Queen, in a letter to the Archbi&s;hop, &s;ignified her hope that the con&s;ultations of the clergy might be of u&s;e to redre&s;s the attempts of loo&s;e and prophane per&s;ons. She &s;ent a licence under the broad &s;eal, empowering them to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s, in as ample a manner as ever had been granted &s;ince the reformation. The Bi&s;hops were purpo&s;ely &s;lighted and overlooked, becau&s;e they had lived in harmony with the mini&s;try. A committee being appointed to draw up a repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church and religion, Atterbury un|dertook the ta&s;k, and compo&s;ed a remon&s;trance that contained the mo&s;t keen and &s;evere &s;trictures upon the admini&s;tration, as it had been exerci&s;ed &s;ince the time of the revolution. Another was penned by the Bi|&s;hops in more moderate terms; and &s;everal regulations were made: but in none of the&s;e did the two hou&s;es agree. They concurred however in cen&s;uring &s;ome tenets favouring Ariani&s;m, broached and &s;upported by Mr. Whi&s;ton, mathematical profe&s;&s;or at Cambridge. He had been expelled the univer&s;ity, and wrote a vindication of him&s;elf, dedicated to the convocation. The Archbi&s;hop doubted, whether this a&s;&s;embly could proceed again&s;t a man for here&s;y: the Judges being con&s;ulted, the majority of them gave in their opinions, that the convocation had a juri&s;diction. The Queen, in a letter to the Bi&s;hops, &s;aid, that as there was no doubt of their juri&s;diction, &s;he expected they would proceed in the matter before them. Fre&s;h &s;cruples ari&s;ing, they determined to examine the book, without proceeding again&s;t the author, and this was cen&s;ured accordingly. An extract of the &s;entence was &s;ent to the Queen; but &s;he did not &s;ignify her plea&s;ure on the &s;ubject, and the affair remained in &s;u&s;pence. Whi&s;ton publi&s;hed a work in four volumes, ju&s;tifying his doc|trine, and maintaining, that the apo&s;tolical con&s;titu|tions were not only canonical, but al&s;o preferable in point of authority to the epi&s;tles and the go&s;pels. The
<PB N="19" REF="22">bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity was now revived in parliament by the Earl of Nottingham, in more mo|derate terms than tho&s;e that had been formerly re|jected; and it pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the Earl's promi&s;e, that if they would con&s;ent to this mea&s;ure, he would bring over many friends to join them in matters of greater impor|tance.</P>
<P>A. D. 1713.] In con&s;equence of the treaty of Utrecht, by which the French King obliged him&s;elf to abandon the Pretender (generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Chevalier de St. George, &s;ince 1708) and acknowledge the Queen's title and the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the Chevalier had repaired to Lorrain. The parliament de&s;ired that the Queen would pre&s;s the Duke of Lorrain, and all the Princes and States in amity with her, to exclude him from their dominions. Her Maje&s;ty taking little notice of this addre&s;s, the Whigs were alarmed: they concluded that the dictates of natural affection had bia&s;&s;ed her in favour of the Chevalier. Whatever &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion &s;he might feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged &s;on of her own father, it does not appear that &s;he ever thought of altering the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. The term of Sacheverel's &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion being now expired, extraordinary rejoicings were made upon the occa&s;ion: he was de&s;ired to preach before the hou&s;e of Commons, who thanked him for his &s;ermon; and the Queen promoted him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's in Holborn, London.</P>
<P>A. D. 1714.] At this period died the Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s Dowager of Hanover (daughter of Frederic King of Bohemia, and grand-daughter of James I. of England) upon who&s;e heirs the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the crown of England, by the act of &s;ettlement, devolved, as the neare&s;t branch of the royal family in the Prote&s;tant line. She was in all re&s;pects one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Prince&s;&s;es of the age in which &s;he
<PB N="20" REF="23">lived. The court of England went in mourning at her death; and the Elector of Brun&s;wic, her &s;on, afterwards King of England, was prayed for by name in the liturgy of the church of England. On May 12, Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to prevent the growth of &s;chi&s;m, and for the further &s;ecurity of the church of England as by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The de&s;ign of it was to prohibit Di&s;&s;enters from teaching in &s;chools and academies. It was ac|cordingly prepared, but eagerly oppo&s;ed in both hou&s;es as a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution. Neverthele&s;s, it made its way through both, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent; but the Queen dying on the day it was to take place, the law was rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty's con&s;titution was now quite broke, one fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;ucceeded another; and what com|pleated the ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occa&s;ioned by the di&s;contents which had been rai&s;ed by the enemies of her government, and by the di&s;&s;entions among her mini&s;ters. At la&s;t &s;he was &s;eized with a lethargic di&s;order, and, notwith&s;tanding all the medicines which the phy&s;icians could pre&s;cribe, the di&s;temper gained ground &s;o fa&s;t, that, on July 30, they de&s;paired of her life. The council immediately a&s;|&s;embled, and took all the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for &s;ecuring the peace of the kingdom. They di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the Elector of Brun&s;wic, informing him of the mea&s;ures they had taken, and de&s;iring he would, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, repair to Holland; where he &s;hould be attended by a Briti&s;h &s;quadron to convoy him to England, in ca&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e. The Queen continued to do&s;e in a lethargic in&s;en&s;ibility, with very &s;hort intervals, till Augu&s;t 1, in the morning, when &s;he expired, in the fiftieth year of her age, and the thirteenth of her reign. The capacity of Anne Stuart, Queen of Great Britain, was naturally good, but not much cultivated by learn|ing; nor did &s;he exhibit any marks of extraordinary
<PB N="21" REF="24">genius, or per&s;onal ambition. She was not deficient in that firmne&s;s of mind by which a Prince ought to pre&s;erve his independence, and avoid the &s;nares and fetters of &s;ycophants and favourites: but whatever might have been her weakne&s;s in that particular, the virtues of her heart could not be que&s;tioned. She was a pattern of conjugal fidelity and affection, a warm friend, an indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s, a munificent pa|tron, and a merciful Prince&s;s, during who&s;e reign no &s;ubject's blood was &s;hed for trea&s;on. She was zea|lou&s;ly attached to the church of England, from con|viction rather than from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, unaffectedly pious, ju&s;t, charitable and compa&s;&s;ionate. She felt a mother's fondne&s;s for her people, by whom &s;he was univer&s;ally beloved, with a warmth of affection which even party-prejudice could not abate. In fine, if &s;he was not the greate&s;t, &s;he was certainly one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed Sovereigns that ever &s;at on the throne of England; and well de&s;erved that expre&s;&s;ive, though &s;imple epithet, "The good Queen Anne."</P>
<P>A. D. 1714.] King George I. a&s;cended the throne of Great Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, with|out the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, tumult, or &s;ign of popular di&s;content; and many were now convinced that no de&s;ign had ever been concerted by Queen Anne and her mini&s;try in favour of the Chevalier de St. George. On September 17, his Maje&s;ty arrived in the river, and, landing at Greenwich, was received by George Fitz-Roy Duke of Northumberland, Captain of the life-guards &s;oon removed and the Lords of the council. It was the misfortune of this Prince, as well as a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had imbibed a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Tories, who con&s;tituted &s;uch a con&s;iderable part of his &s;ubjects. They were now excluded from all &s;hare of the royal favour, which was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by their enemies; and the&s;e early marks of aver&s;ion, which he was at no
<PB N="22" REF="25">pains to conceal, alienated the minds of many from his per&s;on and government who would otherwi&s;e have &s;erved him with fidelity and affection. The number of malecontents con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the King's attachment to the Whig faction. The clamour of the church's being in danger was revived; jealou|&s;ies were excited, &s;editious libels di&s;per&s;ed, and dan|gerous tumults rai&s;ed in different parts of the country. Birmingham, Bri&s;tol, Chippenham, Norwich, Reading, &amp;c. were filled with licentious riot. The party-cry was, "Down with the Whigs; Sacheverel for ever!" Many gentlemen of the Whig party were abu&s;ed; magi&s;trates in towns, and ju&s;tices in the country, were reviled and in&s;ulted by the populace in the execution of their office. Religion was &s;till mingled in all po|litical di&s;putes. The high churchmen complained, that impiety and here&s;y daily gained ground, from the connivance, or at lea&s;t the &s;upine negligence, of the Whig prelates.</P>
<P>The lower hou&s;e of convocation had, before the Queen's death, declared that a book publi&s;hed by Dr. Samuel Clarke, under the title of "The &s;cripture-doctrine of the Trinity," contained a&s;&s;ertions contrary to the Catholic faith. They &s;ent up extracts from this performance to the Bi&s;hops; and the Doctor wrote an an&s;wer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to write an apology, which he pre&s;ented to the upper hou&s;e; but, apprehending it might be publi&s;hed &s;e|parately and mi&s;under&s;tood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the Bi&s;hop of London. This was &s;atisfactory to the Bi&s;hops; but the lower hou&s;e re|&s;olved, that it was no recantation of his heretical a&s;&s;ertions. The di&s;putes about the Trinity increa&s;ing, the Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops received directions, which were publi&s;hed, for pre&s;erving unity in the church, the purity of the Chri&s;tian faith concerning the Holy Trinity, and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the &s;tate. By the&s;e, every preacher was re&s;tricted from
<PB N="23" REF="26">delivering any other doctrine, than what is contained in the holy &s;criptures, with re&s;pect to the Trinity; and from intermeddling in any affairs of &s;tate or go|vernment. The like prohibition was extended to tho&s;e who &s;hould write, harangue, or di&s;pute, on the &s;ame &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>A. D. 1715] The proceedings again&s;t the late Queen's mini&s;ter, and partiality to the Whigs, increa|&s;ed the &s;pirit of di&s;content, which was &s;o much fo|mented by the friends of hereditary right, both in England and Scotland, that it broke out into open re|bellion, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which proved fatal to &s;ome of the fir&s;t families in both kingdoms.</P>
<P>A. D. 1717.] The deliberations of the convocation turned chiefly upon two performances of Dr. Benja|min Hoadly Bi&s;hop of Bangor. One was intitled, <HI>A pre&s;ervative again&s;t the principles and practices of the Nonjurors.</HI> The other was a &s;ermon preached before the King, at the chapel royal at St. James's, on March 31, under the title <HI>Of the nature of the king|dom or church of Chri&s;t.</HI> An an&s;wer to this di&s;cour&s;e was publi&s;hed by Dr. Snape, Ma&s;ter of Eaton college: and the lower hou&s;e of convocation took &s;o great of|fence, and were &s;o highly &s;candalized at &s;ome of the doctrines advanced by that prelate, in tho&s;e two pieces, that they unanimou&s;ly appointed a committee of &s;ix of their members (Dr. Mo&s;s, Dr. Sherlock, Dr. Friend, Dr. Sprat, Dr. Cannon, and Dr. Bi&s;s) to examine the Bi&s;hop's two performances. They drew up a repre|&s;entation, in which <HI>the pre&s;ervative</HI> and <HI>the &s;ermon</HI> were cen&s;ured, as "tending to &s;ubvert all government and di&s;cipline in the church of Chri&s;t; to reduce his king|dom to a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion; to impugn, and impeach, the royal &s;upremacy in cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, and the authority of the legi&s;lature, to inforce obedience in matters of religion by civil &s;anctions." This repre&s;entation was not carried to the upper hou&s;e; for the King or his mini&s;try, being informed of the
<PB N="24" REF="27">matter, took care to prevent the heats and animo&s;ities which this di&s;pute, if not timely checked, might have occa&s;ioned: and therefore his Maje&s;ty &s;ent a writ to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to prorogue the con|vocation. As for the con&s;equences it produced after|wards, among the contending parties, who, upon a trivial incident, in which their own reputations indeed were concerned, but the merits of the cau&s;e not in the lea&s;t affected, grew &s;o outrageous, as, by adverti&s;ement in the public news-papers, &s;igned by their own hands, to give one another the lye, and thereby not only ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the deri&s;ion of the &s;ober part of man|kind, but even the church of England to the attacks and in&s;ults of her enemies; I have neither room nor inclination to in&s;ert them. The Bi&s;hop's chief antago|ni&s;ts were Dr. Snape and Dr Sherlock, whom his Maje&s;ty removed from the office of his chaplains. The convocation has not been permitted to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s ever &s;ince that period, unle&s;s it be to make complimentary addre&s;&s;es to the throne
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of this year, the Rev. Mr. Laurence Howel was convicted, at the Old Bailey, of writing a pamphlet, intitled, "The &s;tate of &s;chi&s;m in the church of England truly &s;tated;" in which he affirmed that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was &s;chi&s;matical &s;ince the deprivation of the primate and the other Bi&s;hops at the revolution. He received &s;entence to pay a fine of 500 l. to the King; to remain in pri&s;on for three years; to find four &s;ureties of 500l. each, and to be bound him&s;elf in 1000l. for his good behaviour during li&s;e, to be twice whipped, to be degraded, and &s;tripped of his gown by the common executioner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On December 13, Earl Stan|hope declared in the hou&s;e of Lords,
<NOTE><HI>The acts to prevent occa&s;ional conformity, and the growth of &s;chi&s;m, repealed.</HI></NOTE> that, in order to unite the hearts of the well-affected to the pre&s;ent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, he had a bill to offer under the title of "An act for &s;trengthening the Pro|te&s;tant intere&s;t in the&s;e kingdoms." It was accord|ingly read, and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity, the growth of &s;chi&s;m,
<PB N="25" REF="28">and &s;ome clau&s;es in the corporation and te&s;t acts. This had been concerted by the mini&s;try, in private meetings with the mo&s;t eminent Di&s;&s;enters. The Tory Lords were a&s;toni&s;hed at this motion, for which they were altogether unprepared: neverthele&s;s they &s;tre|nuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it. They alledged that the bill, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening the church of England, would certainly weaken her, by plucking off her be&s;t feathers, inve&s;ting her enemies with power, and &s;haring with churchmen the civil and military em|ployments, of which they were then wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Earl Cowper declared him&s;elf again&s;t that part of the bill, by which &s;ome clau&s;es of the te&s;t acts were repealed; becau&s;e he looked upon tho&s;e acts as the main bulwark of our excellent con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, which ought to be inviolably pre|&s;erved. Archibald Earl of Ilay (late Duke of Argyle) oppo&s;ed the bill, becau&s;e, in his opinion, it infringed the <HI>pacta conventa</HI> of the treaty of union, by which the bounds, both of the church of England and that of Scotland, were fixed and &s;ettled; and he was ap|prehen&s;ive, if the articles of the union were broke with re&s;pect to one church, it might afterwards be a precedent to break them with re&s;pect to the other. William Wake Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury &s;aid, the acts, which were by this bill to be repealed, were the main bulwark and &s;upporters of the Engli&s;h church. He expre&s;&s;ed all imaginable tenderne&s;s for well-mean|ing con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;enters; but he could not forbear ob&s;erving, that &s;ome among that &s;ect made a wrong u&s;e of the favour and indulgence &s;hewn to them at the revolution, though they had the lea&s;t &s;hare in that happy event: it was therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature to interpo&s;e, and put a &s;top to the &s;canda|lous practice of occa&s;ional conformity. He added, that it would be needle&s;s to repeal the act again&s;t &s;chi&s;m, &s;ince no advantage had been taken of it to the prejudice of Di&s;&s;enters. Dr. Hoadly Bi&s;hop of Bangor
<PB N="26" REF="29">endeavoured to prove, that the occa&s;ional and &s;chi&s;m acts were in effect per&s;ecuting laws; and that, by ad|mitting the principle of &s;elf defence and &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion in matters of religion, all the per&s;ecutions main|tained by the heathens again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;ti|anity, and even the Popi&s;h inqui&s;ition, might be ju&s;ti|fied. With re&s;pect to the powers, of which many clergymen appeared to be &s;o fond and zealous, he owned the de&s;ire of power and riches was natural to all men; but that he had learned, both from rea&s;on and from the go&s;pel, that this mu&s;t be kept within due bounds, and not intrench upon the rights and liberties of their fellow creatures and countrymen. After a long debate, the hou&s;e agreed to leave out &s;ome clau&s;es, concerning the te&s;t and corporation acts: then the bill was committed, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed. It met with great oppo&s;ition in the lower hou&s;e, but was carried by the majority.</P>
<P>While the bill was depending, a clau&s;e was propo&s;ed, whereby all per&s;ons, who came to qualify them&s;elves for offices, were obliged to acknowledge the holy &s;criptures to be a divine in&s;piration, and their faith in the holy Trinity; but was rejected as too great a re|&s;traint.</P>
<P>On November 27, the Rev. Mr. Edward By&s;&s;e, Rector of Portbury, and of St. George, in Somer&s;et|&s;hire, was brought to the court of King's-Bench, We&s;t|min&s;ter, to receive the judgment of that court for the &s;everal facts of which he had been convicted; viz. at the a&s;&s;izes at Sali&s;bury, in Wilt&s;hire, July 25, for &s;peak|ing at Abury, in that county, the following words: "George has no bu&s;ine&s;s here: we have had no laws the&s;e thirty years, never &s;ince the time of King James II. nor &s;hall until King James comes; he is my ma&s;ter, and my rightful King." At the a&s;&s;izes at Ayle&s;bury, in the county of Buckingham, July 28, he was convicted for &s;peaking the &s;ame words at Slough
<PB N="27" REF="30">in that county. At the a&s;&s;izes at Wells, in the county of Somer&s;et, Augu&s;t 29, he was convicted for &s;peak|ing the &s;ame words in the &s;aid city of Wells. At the &s;ame a&s;&s;izes he was convicted for uttering at St. George's in the &s;aid county, the&s;e words: "King George is an u&s;urper; King James is my lawful King." He was al&s;o convicted at the &s;ame a&s;&s;izes, at Wells, for preach|ing, in the pari&s;h-church at Portbury, in the&s;e words: "However God may in judgment allow u&s;urpation, yet God will never pro&s;per or ble&s;s the &s;ame: I need not go to foreign countries for proof of this, but con|fine our&s;elves to our own i&s;land, where we have groan|ed under that plague the&s;e thirty years. We have had neither King, parliament, nor laws, the&s;e thirty years. Things have never been right the&s;e thirty years; that is, &s;ince the misfortune of the father; and things will never be right till the re&s;toration of his &s;on, my ma&s;ter." He was, moreover, convicted at the &s;ame a&s;&s;izes, at Wells, for preaching, in the pari&s;h-church of St. George, in the&s;e words: "King George is an u&s;urper." For the above-mentioned preaching, at Portbury church, he was &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory for an hour at Charing-cro&s;s, on the fir&s;t of December, with this in|&s;cription over his head, "For &s;editious and trea&s;onable preaching;" to be impri&s;oned four years, and to find &s;ureties for his good behaviour during life; him&s;elf in 200 l. penalty, and two &s;ureties in 100 l. each. For his before-mentioned preaching in St. George's church, he was adjudged to &s;tand in the pillory at the Royal Exchange, on the &s;econd of December, for an hour, with the &s;ame in&s;cription over his head, and to pay a fine of 200 l. For his four other offences, above-men|tioned, he was fined 100 l. each.</P>

Mr. Hall had 150 l. of his fine remitted, and his &s;tanding in the pil|lory di&s;pen&s;ed with: but Mr William Wilkins, who only printed off the &s;aid pamphlet, was adjudged to pay a fine of 100 l. to be impri&s;oned for three months, and to find &s;ecurity for his good behaviour for &s;even years, and had no mitigation of his &s;entence.</P>
<P>A. D. 1722.] The Quakers pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e of Commons,
<NOTE><HI>Act in fa|vour of the Quakers.</HI></NOTE> praying that a bill may be brought in for omitting in their &s;o|lemn affirmation the words, "In the pre|&s;ence of Almighty God," as enjoined in an act pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of King William, for making their &s;olemn affirmation to be equivalent to an oath, and made perpetual by a &s;tatute in 1715. The hou&s;e complied with their reque&s;t; but the bill gave ri&s;e to a warm debate among the Peers. Dr. Francis Atter|bury Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter &s;aid, he did not know why &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of indulgence &s;hould be al|lowed to a &s;et of people who were hardly Chri&s;tians. His Lord&s;hip was &s;econded by the Earl of Strafford, Lord North and Grey, and the Archbi&s;hop of York: but they were oppo&s;ed by the Earl of Sunderland, the Duke of Argyle, White Kennet Bi&s;hop of Peterbo|rough, the Earl of Ilay, and the Earl of Macclesfield: and the que&s;tion being put for committing the bill, it was carried in the affirmative by &s;ixty-four voices again&s;t fourteen. On January 17, their Lord&s;hips were to go into a grand committee upon the &s;aid bill, but were prevented by an unexpected petition from &s;ome of the London clergy, which was pre&s;ented by Sir William Dawes Archbi&s;hop of York, and was as follows:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><PB N="29" REF="32"><P>To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in parliament a&s;&s;embled,</P>
<P>The humble petition of the clergy in and about London, with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;heweth,</P>
<P>That there is a bill now depending in your Lord|&s;hips hou&s;e, intitled, <HI>An act for granting the people call|ed Quakers, &s;uch a form of affirmation or declaration, as may remove the difficulties which many of them lie under.</HI> Which bill, &s;hould it pa&s;s into a law, as it may in its con&s;equences nearly affect the property of the &s;ub|ject in general, &s;o it will, in a more e&s;pecial manner, endanger the legal maintenance of the clergy by tithes; ina&s;much as the people called Quakers pretend to deny the payment of tithes upon a principle of con&s;cience; and therefore, as your petitioners apprehend, may be under &s;trong inducements to ea&s;e their con&s;ciences in that re&s;pect, by violating them in another, when their &s;imple affirmation in behalf of friends of the &s;ame per|&s;ua&s;ion &s;hall pa&s;s in all courts of judicature for legal evidence.</P>
<P>However, the injuries that your petitioners in their private affairs may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer, are, as they ought to be, of &s;mall account with them, in compari|&s;on of the mi&s;chiefs which may redound to the &s;ociety from the indulgence intended, as it &s;eems to imply, that ju&s;tice may be duly admini&s;tered, and government &s;upported, without the intervention of any &s;olemn ap|peal to God, as a witne&s;s of the truth of what is &s;aid, by all per&s;ons, in all ca&s;es, of great importance to the common welfare; whereas your petitioners are firmly per&s;uaded, that an oath was in&s;tituted by God him|&s;elf, as the &s;ure&s;t bond of fidelity among men, and hath been e&s;teemed, and found to be &s;o, by the wi&s;|dom and experience of all ages and all nations.</P>
<P>But that which chiefly moves your petitioners to apply to your Lord&s;hips, is their &s;erious concern, le&s;t the minds of good men &s;hould be grieved and wound|ed,
<PB N="30" REF="33">and the enemies of Chri&s;tianity triumph, when they &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ions made, by a Chri&s;tian legi&s;lature, to a &s;et of men who renounce the divine in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, particularly that by which the faithful are initiated into his religion, and denominated Chri&s;tians; and who cannot, on this account, accord|ing to the uniform judgment, and practice of the Ca|tholic church, be deemed worthy of that &s;acred name.</P>
<P>Your petitioners moreover crave leave to repre|&s;ent to your Lord&s;hips, that, upon the be&s;t informa|tion they can get, the in&s;tances wherein any Quaker hath refu&s;ed the &s;olemn affirmation, pre&s;cribed by an act in the &s;eventh and eighth year of William III. have, from the pa&s;&s;ing that act to this day, been exceeding rare; &s;o that there might be ground to hope, that the continued u&s;e of the &s;aid &s;olemn affirmation would, by degrees, have entirely cured that people of all tho&s;e unrea&s;onable prejudices again&s;t an oath, which the favour de&s;igned them by this bill may tend to &s;trengthen and confirm.</P>
<P>And your petitioners humbly leave it to your Lord&s;hips wi&s;e deliberations, whether &s;uch an extra|ordinary indulgence granted to a people already, as is conceived, too numerous, may not contribute to mul|tiply their &s;ect, and tempt per&s;ons to profe&s;s them&s;elves Quakers, in order to be exempted from the obligation of oaths, and to &s;tand upon a foot of privilege, not allowed to the be&s;t Chri&s;tians in the kingdom. Your petitioners therefore humbly hope, that the&s;e and other con&s;iderations, which may offer them&s;elves to your Lord&s;hips great wi&s;dom, may induce your Lord&s;hips not to give your con&s;ent to the pa&s;&s;ing of this bill into a law

After the acce&s;&s;ion of George I. he appeared generally among the prote&s;ters again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the ad|mini&s;tration, and drew up the rea&s;ons of the prote&s;ts with his own hand. This expo&s;ed him to the re&s;ent|ment of the mini&s;ters, and on Augu&s;t 24, 1722, he was committed to the Tower on an accu&s;ation of high-trea&s;on; &s;everal noblemen and gentlemen, being al&s;o taken into cu&s;tody, on the &s;ame pretence, about that time or before the end of the year

The con|finement of the Bi&s;hop was con&s;idered, by the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics throughout the whole kingdom, as an outrage upon the church of England and the epi&s;copal order; and mo&s;t of the clergy, in and about London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, offered up public prayers, in their &s;eve|ral churches and chapels, for his health. About the end of March, this year, a bill for inflicting pains and penalties on his Lord&s;hip was brought into the hou&s;e of Commons, when Sir William Wyndham affirmed, that there was no evidence again&s;t him, but conjectures and hear&s;ays. The Bi&s;hop, as a member of the upper hou&s;e, made no defence before the Commons: but when the bill was carried up to the Peers, his Lord&s;hip and coun&s;el were heard, and &s;upported by many of the able&s;t &s;peakers and lawyers in that a&s;&s;embly, who pointed out the in&s;ufficiency of the evidence. How|ever, his antagoni&s;ts not being &s;o &s;olicitous about an|&s;wering rea&s;ons, as eager to put the que&s;tion, the bill was carried by a majority of eighty-three again&s;t forty-three,

<P>THE church-government in Scotland was epi&s;|copal, from the time of their conver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian religion, which was begun by Palladius a|bout the year 430
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miller's Propagation of Chri&s;tianity, vol. ii. p. 63.</NOTE> after the birth of our Saviour; or rather, from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tian churches in that kingdom, in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries, and &s;o continued till the reformation took place, in the reigns of Mary, mother of James I. and of Mary I. of Eng|land; but the Pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline was not finally e&s;tabli&s;hed therein until the reign of King William and Mary, A. D. 1689, when epi&s;copacy was totally aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">Mr. John Knox, a native of Scotland, and a bold and courageous divine, was the in&s;trument, in the hands of Providence, to bring about the work of re|formation in that kingdom, for which he was well qualified by his undaunted &s;pirit, his learning, and his eloquence, which were extraordinary for tho&s;e times. He had been a public preacher, in King Edward VI.'s reign, in England; was, in the next, an exile at Franckfort, and afterwards one of the Pa&s;tors of the Engli&s;h congregation at Geneva: from thence he came to Edinburgh, May 2, 1559, being then 54 years of age. He &s;ettled at Perth; but was unwearied in his travels and labours over the whole kingdom
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;tory of the Puritans, vol. i. p. 163.</NOTE>. He had the boldne&s;s to maintain this po&s;ition, "That if Kings and Princes refu&s;ed to reform religion, inferior magi&s;trates and the people, being directed and in&s;truct|ed in the truth by their preachers, may lawfully reform within their own bounds them&s;elves; and if all, or the far greater part, be enlightened by the truth, they may make a public reformation."</P>
<P>Upon this principle Knox and his brethren petition|ed the Queen-mother, who was Regent for her daugh|ter Queen Mary, then in France, for liberty to a&s;&s;em|ble publickly or privately, for the performance of re|ligious duties and offices in the vulgar tongue, and for admini&s;tring the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper in both kinds, according to the in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Their petition, tho' &s;o rea&s;onable, not being admitted, an a&s;&s;ociation was formed by a con&s;iderable number of the nobility, who re&s;olved to ri&s;k their lives and for|tunes in behalf of the indulgence they had reque&s;ted. They encouraged the curates of the pari&s;hes within their re&s;pective di&s;tricts to read the prayers and le&s;&s;ons in Engli&s;h; but not to expound the &s;criptures till li|berty was obtained from the Queen. This being practi&s;ed, with &s;ucce&s;s, at Perth and &s;ome neighbour|ing
<PB N="36" REF="39">places, and no di&s;turbance en&s;uing, the a&s;&s;ociation was entered into by greater numbers, and even at Edinburgh, the capital, many &s;igned it</P>
<P>Having made &s;uch a multitude of pro&s;elytes, they again petitioned the Queen-Regent, and repre&s;ented to her the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gour &s;he exerci&s;ed a|gain&s;t the Prote&s;tants, con&s;idering their numbers: but the Regent continued deaf to their remon&s;trances, and rejected every moderate mea&s;ure to which &s;he was ad|vi&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the parliament met, the congregation, or chiefs of the a&s;&s;ociation, pre&s;ented a &s;et of articles to the Regent, relative to liberty of con&s;cience, to be laid before the hou&s;e; but &s;he would not admit them to be debated; whereupon they drew up the following pro|te&s;tation, and de&s;ired it might be recorded: "That &s;ince they could not procure a reformation, agreeable to the word of God, from the government, that it might be lawful for them to follow the dictates of their own con&s;ciences: that none that joined them in the profe&s;&s;ion of the true faith &s;hould be liable to any civil penalties, or incur any damages for &s;o doing. If any tumults ari&s;e on the &s;core of religion, they prote&s;t the imputation ought not to lie upon them, who now humbly entreat for a regular remedy; and that in all other things they will be mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>The Regent having acquainted the court of France with the &s;ituation of affairs, received orders to &s;uffer no other religion but the Roman Catholic. and a pro|mi&s;e to &s;upply her with forces to back her proceedings. Hereupon &s;he &s;ummoned the inhabitants of Perth, and the reformed mini&s;ters, to appear before her at Stir|ling; and they accordingly attended, followed by multitudes of people, well armed, and determined to defend them, if any violence were offered to their per|&s;ons. This &s;ight filled the Regent with apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety, and &s;he prayed the multitude might re|tire, giving her word that nothing &s;hould be decreed
<PB N="37" REF="40">again&s;t the mini&s;ters. However, as &s;oon as they had yielded to her per&s;ua&s;ions, and were retired quietly home, &s;he condemned them for non-appearance.</P>
<P>The fal&s;ification of her promi&s;e no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooner reached Perth, than the burghers, encouraged by the neigh|bouring nobility and gentry, formed an army of 7000 men, which was put under the command of the Earl of Glencairn, for the defence of their mini&s;ters again&s;t the Regent, who marched again&s;t them with an army compo&s;ed of French and Scotch, in order to drive them out of their country. Seeing the burghers had made preparations to give her a warm reception, &s;he was willing to con&s;ent to a treaty, by which it was agreed &s;he &s;hould be received into the city with all due honour, and &s;uffered to re&s;ide there &s;ome days, provided &s;he promi&s;ed to make no alteration in religion, but refer|red what related thereto to the parliament, and the Scotch forces, on both &s;ides, to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But the wily Regent had no &s;ooner entered the city, and the reformed had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their troops, than &s;he broke the articles, &s;et up the ma&s;s, and left a French garri|&s;on in the town, with a re&s;olution to make it a place of arms. She al&s;o declared that "promi&s;es were not to be kept with hereticks;" whereupon the congrega|tions of Fife, Perth, Dundee, Angus, Merns, and Montro&s;e, rai&s;ed a body of men, and engaged to &s;tand by one another, in maintenance of the reformation, with their lives and fortunes. Mr. Knox in&s;pirited them by his prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing, and the common people, warm with re&s;entment, pulled down altars and images, de|&s;troyed the Popi&s;h ornaments in churches, and plun|dered many mona&s;teries. The Regent marched again&s;t them at the head of 2000 French, and 2000 Scotch, in French pay; but not being inclined to hazard a bat|tle, &s;he retired to Dunbar, and the reformers made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Perth, Scoon, Stirling, and Linlithgow, which &s;oon produced a truce, and the re|formed mini&s;ters had liberty to preach in the pulpits
<PB N="38" REF="41">at Edinburgh, for the pre&s;ent. But the &s;cene was &s;oon changed, and upon receiving the recruits and money from France, the Regent took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leith, fortified it, and &s;tored it with every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its defence. The confederates complained of this breach of the truce, and be&s;ought her to de|moli&s;h the works; but &s;he commanded them not to violate their allegiance, and to lay down their arms. To inforce her commands, &s;he marched &s;uddenly to Edinburgh, and obliged them to de&s;ert that capital and retire to Stirling; but the French troops following them clo&s;e at the heels, they were di&s;per&s;ed into the mountains. The &s;pirit which actuated them was far from being abated in this di&s;tre&s;s, and they even pub|li&s;hed a proclamation, wherein they deprived the Re|gent of her authority, and threatened to treat all tho&s;e as enemies who obeyed her orders. The&s;e &s;ort of acts, tho' they were tokens of their fortitude, yet could not enable them to face the Regent's forces, whereupon they re&s;olved to put them&s;elves under the protection of Queen Elizabeth. That wi&s;e Prince&s;s weighing the nature of the ca&s;e, and perceiving the danger that would ari&s;e to her own crown, as well as the Prote&s;tant religion, if Scotland became entirely attached to Popery, under the government of a Popi&s;h Queen, who was al&s;o Queen of France, and claimed the crown of Eng|land, entered into an alliance with the confederate re|formers, to &s;upport them in their religious and civil liberties; and the treaty was &s;igned at Berwick, Fe|bruary 27, 1560. By this treaty the Queen engaged to &s;end forces into Scotland, to continue there till Scotland was re&s;tored to its liberties and privileges, and the French driven out of the kingdom. Eliza|beth pur&s;uant thereto &s;ent a body of forces, con&s;i&s;ting of 7000 foot and 1200 hor&s;e, which joined an army of the &s;ame force, rai&s;ed by the confederates. This combined army was, &s;ometime afterwards, reinforced from the northern marches, by a large detachment,
<PB N="39" REF="42">commanded by the Duke of Norfolk; and upon this junction they reduced Leith, and obliged the Regent to &s;hut her&s;elf up in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, where &s;he decea&s;ed June 10, 1560.</P>
<P>The French alarmed at this progre&s;s would have re&s;tored Calais, provided Elizabeth would recall her forces from Scotland; but this &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. But the troubles in France laid the French, &s;oon after, under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending for their troops home, for which purpo&s;e they di&s;patched plenipotentiaries into Scotland to treat with tho&s;e of Elizabeth about the method of withdrawing them, and the re&s;toration of the Scotch to their parliamentary government.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the month of Augu&s;t
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calderwood &s;ays the beginning of July.</NOTE> a treaty was concluded, by which a general amne&s;ty was granted; the Engli&s;h and French troops were to with|draw in two months; and a parliament was to be a&s;|&s;embled with all convenient &s;peed to &s;ettle the affairs of religion and the kingdom. Though Francis and Mary refu&s;ed to ratify this treaty, the parliament a&s;|&s;embled in Augu&s;t 1560, by virtue thereof, without any direct authority from the crown for that purpo&s;e. Francis indeed died before they met, and left his wife, Queen Mary, a young, and not very prudent widow, being entirely and zealou&s;ly attached to Po|pery, and under the management of her French re|lations.</P>
<P>The barons and gentlemen petitioned the parliament to &s;uppre&s;s the doctrines of the church of Rome, in certain exceptionable points; to revive the ancient church-di&s;cipline, and to aboli&s;h the Pope's u&s;urped authority.</P>
<P>All this received their approbation, and the mini&s;ters were de&s;ired to draw up a confe&s;&s;ion of faith: this they performed, in twenty-&s;ix articles, following there|in the &s;entiments of Calvin and the foreign reformers.
<PB N="40" REF="43">This confe&s;&s;ion being read, was carried in the parlia|ment, only three voices di&s;&s;enting therefrom, and the Popi&s;h prelates offering no arguments in defence of the old religion</P>
<P>By another act they aboli&s;hed the authority of the Pope, and reading ma&s;s was to be puni&s;hed; for the fir&s;t offence with lo&s;s of goods; for the &s;econd, with bani&s;hment; and for the third, with death. This la&s;t puni&s;hment was certainly not to be defended in the&s;e reformers: difference of &s;entiment may ari&s;e from want of under&s;tanding, or from the prejudices of education; and no man, as a good writer has ob|&s;erved, &s;hould be de&s;troyed for his &s;incerity, unle&s;s his opinions tend to mutiny and trea&s;on, and &s;ap the foun|dations of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>When the parliament broke up, a commi&s;&s;ion di|rected to Mr. Knox, Mr. Willock, Mr. Spot&s;wood, and &s;ome other divines, to draw up a &s;cheme of di&s;|cipline for the church, was executed by them nearly upon the plan of the church at Geneva; &s;ave that they admitted &s;uperintendants in the name of Bi&s;hops, and, in the ordination of mini&s;ters, rejected the impo|&s;ition of hands; their rea&s;on for the latter omi&s;&s;ion was, that they apprehended miracles formerly accom|panied that ceremony, which they now imagined had cea&s;ed. They appointed &s;uperintendants, to the num|ber of ten or twelve, to plant and erect kirks, and to appoint mini&s;ters where there were none already. "But," &s;ay they, "the&s;e men mu&s;t not live like idle Bi&s;hops, but mu&s;t preach them&s;elves twice or thrice a week, and vi&s;it their di&s;tricts every three or four months, to in&s;pect the lives and behaviour of the parochial mini&s;ters, to redre&s;s grievances, or bring them before an a&s;&s;embly of the kirk." The&s;e &s;uper|intendants were to be elected by the mini&s;ters and elders of the &s;everal provinces, and to be deprived by them for mi&s;behaviour. The a&s;&s;emblies of the kirk
<PB N="41" REF="44">were to be cla&s;&s;ical, provincial and national, in which la&s;t the &s;upreme kirk juri&s;diction was repo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The reformers warmly expected that when this plan of di&s;cipline was laid before the e&s;tates, it would meet with a parliamentary &s;anction; but in&s;tead there|of it was referred to future con&s;ideration. Upon which, after the rece&s;s of parliament, many of the nobles, barons and chief men of the nation, met to|gether, at the in&s;tance of Mr. Knox, and &s;igned the plan, re&s;olving to abide by the new di&s;cipline, till it &s;hould be confirmed or altered by parliament: thus, in effect, without the authority of an act of parlia|ment, the hierarchical government was laid a&s;ide, and the kirk of Scotland e&s;tabli&s;hed, though, as will be &s;een, it had the &s;anction of no law, till &s;ome years after.</P>
<P>It may not be improper, before we proceed, to ex|plain the motives of the fir&s;t reformers for making &s;o great a difference in the new model of church-government, from that which had been &s;o long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and to reflect a little upon the proceedings already related.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland, vol. i. p. 212. Knox, 259.</NOTE> As the vices of the clergy had at fir&s;t excited the indignation of mankind, and rou&s;ed that &s;pirit of enquiry which proved &s;o fatal to the whole Popi&s;h &s;y&s;tem: as this di&s;gu&s;t at the vices of eccle&s;ia&s;tics was &s;oon tranferred to their per&s;ons, and &s;hifting from them, by no violent tran&s;ition, &s;ettled at la&s;t on the offices they enjoyed; the effects of the reformation would naturally have extended not only to the doc|trine, but to the government of the Popi&s;h church, and the &s;ame &s;pirit which aboli&s;hed the former would have overturned the latter. But in Germany, Eng|land, and the Northern kingdoms, its operations were checked by the power and policy of their Princes, and the ancient epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, under a few limita|tions,
<PB N="42" REF="45">was &s;till continued in tho&s;e churches. The epi&s;|copal hierarchy appears to be more conformable to the practice of the church, &s;ince Chri&s;tianity be|came the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the Roman empire. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical government was, at that time, plainly copied from the civil; the fir&s;t not only borrowed its form, but derived its authority from the latter, and the dioce&s;es and juri&s;diction of Patriarchs, Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, corre&s;ponded with the divi&s;ion and con|&s;titution of the empire. In Switzerland and the Low Countries, the nature of the government allowing full &s;cope to the genius of the reformation, all pre-emi|nence of order in the church was de&s;troyed, and an equality e&s;tabli&s;hed more &s;uitable to the &s;pirit of re|publican policy. The &s;ituation of the primitive church &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, and furni&s;hed the model of the latter &s;y&s;tem, which has &s;ince been called <HI>Pre&s;byterian.</HI> The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, oppre&s;&s;ed by continual per&s;ecu|tions, and obliged to hold their religious a&s;&s;emblies by &s;tealth and in corners, were contented with a form of government extremely &s;imple. The influence of re|ligion concurred with the &s;en&s;e of danger, in extin|gui&s;hing among them the &s;pirit of ambition, and in pre&s;erving a parity of rank, the effects of their &s;uffer|ings, and the cau&s;e of many of their virtues &mdash; Calvin
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. pag. 121, 131, &amp; &s;eq. of this work.</NOTE>, who&s;e deci&s;ions were received among the Prote&s;tants of that age, with incredible &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was the patron and re&s;torer of this &s;cheme of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical policy. The church of Geneva, formed under his eye, and by his direction, was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t perfect model of this government, and Knox, who during his re&s;idence in that city had &s;tudied and ad|mired it, warmly recommended it to the imitation of his countrymen.</P>
<P>Among the Scotch nobles &s;ome hated the per&s;ons, others coveted the wealth of the dignified clergy,
<PB N="43" REF="46">and, by aboli&s;hing that order of men, the former in|dulged their re&s;entment, and the latter hoped to gra|tify their avarice. The people, inflamed with the mo&s;t violent aver&s;ion to Popery, and approving every &s;cheme that departed farthe&s;t from the practice of the Romi&s;h church, were delighted with a &s;y&s;tem &s;o admirably &s;uited to their predominant pa&s;&s;ion; while the friends of civil liberty beheld, with plea&s;ure, the Prote&s;tant clergy putting down-with their own hands, that fabric of eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, which their predece&s;&s;ors had reared with &s;o much art and indu&s;try, and flattered them&s;elves, that, by lending their aid to &s;trip church|men of their dignity and wealth, they might entirely deliver the nation from their exorbitant and oppre&s;&s;ive juri&s;diction. The new mode of government ea&s;ily made its way among men thus prepared by their various intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions for its reception.</P>
<P>But, on the fir&s;t introduction of his &s;y&s;tem, Knox did not deem it expedient to depart altogether from the ancient form
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, 158.</NOTE>; in&s;tead of Bi&s;hops, he propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h ten or twelve &s;uperintendants in different parts of the kingdom: the&s;e, as the name implies, were impowered to in&s;pect the life and doctrine of the other clergy, as before ob&s;erved; they pre&s;ided in the inferior judicatories of the church, and performed &s;everal other parts of the epi&s;copal functions: their juri&s;dic|tions however extended to &s;acred things only, they claimed no feat in parliament, and pretended no rights to the dignity or revenues of the former Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The number of inferior clergy, to whom the care of parochial duty could be committed, was &s;till extremely &s;mall. They had embraced the principles of the re|formation at different times, and from various mo|tives: during the public commotions, they were &s;cat|tered, merely by chance, over the different provinces of the kingdom, and in a few places only were formed
<PB N="44" REF="47">into regular cla&s;&s;es or &s;ocieties. The fir&s;t general a&s;|&s;embly of the church which was held, December 20, 1560, bears all the marks of an infant, unformed church or &s;ociety; the members were but few in num|ber, and of no con&s;iderable rank; no uniform or con|&s;i&s;tent rule &s;eems to have been ob&s;erved in electing them. From a great part of the kingdom no repre&s;en|tatives appeared; in the name of &s;ome counties only one per&s;on was pre&s;ent, while other &s;ingle towns de|puted &s;everal. A convention &s;o feeble and irregular could po&s;&s;e&s;s no great authority; and, con&s;cious of their weakne&s;s the members put an end to their de|bates, without venturing upon any deci&s;ion of much importance
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on, 215. Keith 498.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Knox, as already ob&s;erved, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brethren, in order to give greater &s;trength and con|&s;i&s;tency to the Pre&s;byterian plan, compo&s;ed the fir&s;t book of di&s;cipline, which contains the model or plat|form of the intended policy. They pre&s;ented it to a convention of the e&s;tates in 1561; and whatever re|gulations were propo&s;ed with regard to eccle&s;ia&s;tic di&s;|cipline and juri&s;diction, would have ea&s;ily obtained the &s;anction of that a&s;&s;embly; but a de&s;ign to recover the patrimony of the church, which was therein in&s;inuated, met with a very different reception
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on, 215.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In vain did the clergy di&s;play the advantages which would accrue to the public by a proper application of eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues; in vain did they propo&s;e, by an impartial di&s;tribution of this fund, to promote true religion, to encourage learning, and to &s;upport the poor; in vain did they even intermingle threat|nings of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, again&s;t the unju&s;t de|tainers of what was appropriated to a &s;acred u&s;e. The nobles treated this as a project altogether vi&s;io|nary, and, &s;o far attached to their intended reforma|tion, they would admit of no pleas to retard it.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">But to return to the thread of our hi&s;tory: Mary, Queen of Scots, returned to Scotland in Augu&s;t 1561, and might have had a &s;afe-conduct through England, if &s;he had con&s;ented to ratify the treaty of Aug 1560; but rather than comply, &s;he cho&s;e to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n all ri&s;ks, and, to her great mortification, found her people in general, with very few exceptions, converted to Prote&s;tanti&s;m. She her&s;elf was, by the a&s;&s;embly in 1565, confined to have ma&s;s only in her private chapel, and unaccom|panied with that pomp and o&s;tentation which perhaps alone rendered it the favourite &s;ervice of the votaries of the church of Rome. The Queen, bred up in a reverence for that church, would certainly have me|rited a gentler treatment than &s;he received; but the reformed did not, in her ca&s;e, con&s;ider the prejudices of education: the general a&s;&s;embly petitioned her to ratify the acts of parliament for aboli&s;hing the ma&s;s, and for obliging all her &s;ubjects to frequent the re|formed wor&s;hip. She replied, that &s;he &s;aw no impiety in the ma&s;s, and was determined not to quit the reli|gion in which &s;he was bred, being &s;atisfied it was founded in the word of God, and that her change would al&s;o be prejudicial to her temporal intere&s;t. Without any &s;tretch of Chri&s;tian charity, the&s;e were certainly her &s;entiments; and the return of the gene|ral a&s;&s;embly was very coar&s;e, and very little to the purpo&s;e, viz. "That Turci&s;m &s;tood upon as good ground as Popery." What followed, in their replica|tion, was more worthy of the venerable a&s;&s;embly, when they required her, "in the name of the eternal God, to inform her&s;elf better, by frequenting &s;ermons, and conferring with learned men." However, the Queen was not to be moved, and continued, with a blind zeal, to per&s;i&s;t in the errors &s;he had embraced.</P>
<P>In 1567, the Pope's authority in matters eccle&s;i|a&s;tical was again aboli&s;hed in the parliament and a&s;|&s;embly at Edinburgh; and the act of 1560, for re|nouncing the juri&s;diction of the court of Rome, was
<PB N="46" REF="49">confirmed, and all acts pa&s;&s;ed in former reigns, for the &s;upport of Popi&s;h idolatry, were annulled; the new confe&s;&s;ion of faith was ratified, and the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters, and tho&s;e of their communion, declared to be the true and only church within the realm. The examination and admi&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters was declared to be only in the power and di&s;po&s;ition of the church, with a &s;aving clau&s;e for lay patrons. By another act, the future Kings, at their coronation, were to take an oath to maintain the reformed religion, as then pro|fe&s;&s;ed; and by a third act, none but tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion, as then e&s;tabli&s;hed, were to be capable of being judges or proctors, or of prac|ti&s;ing in any of the courts of ju&s;tice, excepting the right of offices hereditary, or for life.</P>
<P>The general a&s;&s;embly declared their approbation of the di&s;cipline of the reformed churches of Geneva and Switzerland, and of a parity among mini&s;ters, in op|po&s;ition to the &s;uperior claim of Bi&s;hops. However, as the&s;e acts of a&s;&s;embly were not confirmed by parlia|ment, epi&s;copal government could not be &s;aid to be legally aboli&s;hed, though it was tacitly &s;u&s;pended till the King came of age, and all church-affairs managed by pre&s;byteries and general a&s;&s;emblies. But the gene|ral a&s;&s;embly a&s;&s;erted their power of the keys at this pe|riod, by depo&s;ing the Bi&s;hop of Orkney, for marrying the Queen to the Earl of Bothwell, and by making the Counte&s;s of Argyle do penance for a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the marriage.</P>
<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, after this, lay dormant for a con&s;iderable time, while the civil government under|went many extraordinary revolutions; though the church was under many unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions from the con&s;equences that might re&s;ult from them, in regard to the peace and happine&s;s of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical body. Two things chiefly ingro&s;&s;ed the attention of the cler|gy. The one was, the forming a &s;y&s;tem of di&s;cipline or eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, which, with much difficulty,
<PB N="47" REF="50">was in &s;ome mea&s;ure effected; the other was, the abo|lition of the epi&s;copal order. This was in the year 1581. And in the year 1582. another general a&s;&s;em|bly of the pre&s;bytery met at Gla&s;gow, wherein, with much warmth, the dignities, honours, emolum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, and the very function of Bi&s;hops, were attacked. The nobles viewed their power with jealou&s;y; the common people con&s;idered their lives as profane, and wi&s;hed their downfal with equal ardour; and at length an act was pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the office of Bi&s;hop, as it was then exerci&s;ed within the realm, to have neither foundation nor warrant in the word of God; and re|quired, under pain of excommunication, all who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that office, in&s;tantly to re&s;ign it, and to ab|&s;tain from preaching or admini&s;tering the &s;acrament, till they &s;hould receive permi&s;&s;ion from the a&s;&s;embly. Some of the proceedings of the a&s;&s;embly were laid be|fore the court, and the decree which followed there|upon; but the court did not acquie&s;ce therein: and very warm repre&s;entations en&s;ued, both from the Epi&s;|copalian and Pre&s;byterian parties
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on, vol. ii. p. 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, an attention to civil affairs prevented any thing con&s;iderable to be done; in&s;omuch that many of the nobles, and many others of the people, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed to be actuated by a religious zeal, and provoked by the injuries offered to the church, determined to protect the Prote&s;tant religion by force of arms: they therefore conjured the King not to di&s;appoint their hopes and wi&s;hes, nor to refu&s;e the &s;uffering church that aid which &s;he &s;o much needed: but &s;o little &s;uc|ce&s;s attended their mea&s;ures, that the King called a convention of e&s;tates on June 5, 1597, who humbled the power of the church, and abridged the privileges of the city of Edinburgh. The city was declared to have forfeited its privileges as a corporation; the ca|pital of the kingdom was deprived of magi&s;trates, at
<PB N="48" REF="51">lea&s;t not allowed to elect their own magi&s;trates, nor their own mini&s;ters; many new burdens were impo&s;ed on them, and a great &s;um of money was exacted by way of peace-offering.</P>
<P>King James having thus far &s;ucceeded in his mea|&s;ures, he was now very a&s;&s;iduous in forming and exe|cuting other &s;chemes to complete his de&s;ign: and in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain the clergy, whom he had in vain attempted to &s;ubdue, popular agents were &s;et to work all over the kingdom; promi&s;es, flattery, and threats were employed; the u&s;urpations of the bre|thren, near the capital, were aggravated; the jealou&s;y of their power, which was growing in the di&s;tant pro|vinces, was augmented, and two different general a&s;|&s;embles were held, in both which, notwith&s;tanding the zeal and boldne&s;s wherewith a few leading clergymen defended the privileges of the church, a majority de|clared in favour of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which were agree|able to the King. Many practices, which had con|tinued &s;ince the reformation, were condemned; many points of di&s;cipline, which had hitherto been reckoned &s;acred and uncontroverted, were given up: the licence with which mini&s;ters di&s;cour&s;ed of political things was re&s;trained, the freedom with which they inveighed again&s;t particular per&s;ons cen&s;ured, the convoking a general a&s;&s;embly without the King's permi&s;&s;ion pro|hibited, and the right of nominating mini&s;ters in the principal towns ve&s;ted in the crown. Thus, the clergy them&s;elves &s;urrendered privileges which it would have been dangerous to invade by force, and &s;ubjected them&s;elves and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to an intolerable yoke, which le&s;&s;ened the popular topic of the encroachments of the King, and turned the general out-cry of the people on the corruptions of their own order

<P><PB N="49" REF="52">The King however found it no ea&s;y matter to carry his point, though he was &s;o intent upon new-mo|delling the church as to neglect other objects of go|vernment. Towards the end of the year 1598, a parliament was held in order to confer certain privi|leges and honours upon the Bi&s;hops; and an act was pa&s;&s;ed, by which tho&s;e mini&s;ters on whom the King &s;hould confer the vacant bi&s;hoprics, &s;hould be intitled to vote in parliament; and that the clergy might con|ceive no jealou&s;y of any encroachments on their privi|leges, it was remitted to the general a&s;&s;embly to de|termine what &s;piritual juri&s;diction or authority in the government of the church, the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s: but though the clergy perceived it would be an acce&s;&s;ion of honour to be admitted into the &s;upreme council of the nation, their abhorrence of epi&s;copacy was extreme; and to this they &s;acrificed every con&s;ide|ration of intere&s;t or ambition. All the King's profe&s;|&s;ions of regard for the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the church did not convince them of his &s;incerity; their own experience had taught them with what in&s;inuating progre&s;s the hierarchy advances, and though admitted at fir&s;t with moderate authority, and under &s;pecious pretences, how rapidly it extends its dominion. "Var|ni&s;h over this &s;cheme," &s;aid one of the clergymen, "with what colours you plea&s;e; deck the intruder with the utmo&s;t art; under all this di&s;gui&s;e, I &s;ee the horns of his mitre." The &s;ame &s;entiments prevailed among many of his brethren, and induced them to re|ject power and honours, with as much zeal as ever tho&s;e of their order courted them. Many, however, were allured by hopes of preferment. The King him|&s;elf and his mini&s;ters employed the &s;ame arts which they had tried &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully la&s;t year; and after long debates and much oppo&s;ition the general a&s;&s;embly de|clared, that it was lawful for mini&s;ters to accept of a &s;eat in parliament; that it would be highly beneficial to the church to have its repre&s;entatives in that &s;upreme
<PB N="50" REF="53">court; and that fifty-one per&s;ons, a number nearly equal to that of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics who were antiently called to parliament, &s;hould be cho&s;en from among the clergy for that purpo&s;e; but the manner of their election, together with the power with which they &s;hould be inve&s;ted, were left undecided for the pre&s;ent, and furni&s;hed matter for future deliberation

<P>The que&s;tions with regard to the election and power of the repre&s;entatives of the church were finally deter|mined in the year 1600, by the general a&s;&s;embly, which met at Montro&s;e; and it was there agreed, that the general a&s;&s;embly &s;hould recommend &s;ix per&s;ons to every vacant benefice, which gave a title to a &s;eat in parliament, out of whom the King &s;hould nominate one: that the per&s;on &s;o elected &s;hould neither pro|po&s;e nor con&s;ent to any thing there, that may affect the intere&s;t of the church, without &s;pecial in&s;tructions for that purpo&s;e: that he &s;hall &s;ubmit to its cen&s;ure without appeal: that he &s;hall di&s;charge the duty of a pa&s;tor in a particular congregation: that he &s;hall not u&s;urp any eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction &s;uperior to that of his other brethren: that he &s;hould annually re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion to the general a&s;&s;embly, which may be re|&s;tored to him or not, as the a&s;&s;embly, with the King's approbation, &s;hall judge mo&s;t expedient for the good of the church

<P>In the year 1617, James (who a&s;cended the Engli&s;h throne on the twenty-third of March 1603, and &s;oon after went to re&s;ide in England) to advance the epi&s;|copal cau&s;e, made a progre&s;s into Scotland, and his chapel at Edinburgh was adorned with &s;tatues and pictures. Two acts were pa&s;&s;ed, one relative to the choice of Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, and the &s;econd for the re&s;titution of chapters; and the mini&s;ters pro|te&s;ting again&s;t them, many of them were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;ome bani&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">In 1618, in a convention held at Perth, the court and Bi&s;hops, with &s;ome difficulty, made a &s;hift to carry five articles, importing, that the holy &s;acrament &s;hould be received kneeling; that mini&s;ters &s;hould be enabled to admini&s;ter the &s;acrament in private hou&s;es to the &s;ick; that they &s;hould baptize children privately at home, if reque&s;ted &s;o to do; that they &s;hould con|firm &s;uch children as can &s;ay their catechi&s;m, and re|peat the Lord's prayer, creed, and ten command|ments; and that the fe&s;tivals of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, Whit&s;untide, and a&s;cen&s;ion of our Saviour, &s;hould for the future be commemorated in the kirk of Scotland. The&s;e articles were ordered to be publi&s;hed at the market-cro&s;&s;es, and to be read by the mini&s;ters in the pulpits; but the greate&s;t number of them refu&s;ed, as there was no penalty incurred by the omi&s;&s;ion, &s;ave the King's di&s;plea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;i|tion of the mini&s;ters, the court got the&s;e articles ratified by the parliament in 1621, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the kirk and nation. This rai&s;ed &s;o much ill blood, that a new per&s;ecution was carried on throughout the kingdom; numbers of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters were fined, impri&s;oned, and bani&s;hed by the high com|mi&s;&s;ion; and this they &s;uffered, though from their in|tere&s;t with the people they could have turned their oppre&s;&s;ors out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Things remained much in the &s;ame &s;tate till the reign of King Charles the Fir&s;t. That unhappy Monarch, pre&s;&s;ed on by Laud, made a progre&s;s into Scotland, in the year 1633, with a view to advance the epi&s;copacy; for notwith&s;tanding Bi&s;hops had exi&s;ted in Scotland for &s;ome years, they had little more than the name, being &s;ubject to an a&s;&s;embly that was purely Pre&s;byterian. To advance their juri&s;diction, he had renewed the high commi&s;&s;ion, and forbid all general a&s;&s;emblies of the kirk. He was crowned at Edinburgh, June 18, and on the 20th the parliament met, and very complai&s;antly gave him a large &s;um of money; but in the matter of
<PB N="52" REF="55">the acts <HI>concerning his royal prerogative,</HI> and the <HI>apparel of kirkmen,</HI> and <HI>for the ratification of former acts touching religion,</HI> he behaved to his parliament with &s;uch arbi|trary, overbearing haughtine&s;s, and carried them through with &s;uch barefaced craft, that he di&s;gu&s;ted all ranks and orders of people; which, together with the contempt he poured upon the Scots clergy, and the high hand with which he attempted to introduce the ceremonies of the church of England, alienated the affections of the generality of his Scotch &s;ubjects: nor did Laud's behaviour there do him the lea&s;t credit, or redound at all to his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t. The mouths of the Scots clergy were opened; and they inveighed bitterly again&s;t the hierarchy of England. To widen the breach, in 1635, a book of canons for Scotland was drawn up by the new Bi&s;hops of that kingdom, and revi&s;ed by Laud, Juxon and Wren, which was confirmed by the King under his great &s;eal, May 23, though &s;ubver&s;ive of the whole con&s;titution of Scotland, in kirk and &s;tate. The Scots Pre&s;bytery declared peremptorily again&s;t it.</P>
<P>In the year 1637, a new liturgy, in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame with the Engli&s;h, was &s;ent into Scotland, ac|companied with a royal proclamation, dated Dec 12, 1636, commanding all the King's loving &s;ubjects of that kingdom to receive it with reverence, <HI>as the only form his Maje&s;ty thinks fit to be u&s;ed in that kirk,</HI> with|out &s;o much as laying it before a &s;ynod, convocation, general a&s;&s;embly, or parliament of that nation; &s;o precipitant and imprudent was this head-&s;trong ill-ad|vi&s;ed Prince, in all the mea&s;ures he pur&s;ued relative to that kingdom, the genius of who&s;e inhabitants he &s;eemed totally unacquainted with. The reading it in the pulpits was oppo&s;ed by the people in a mo&s;t vio|lent and tumultuous manner; and notwith&s;tanding the repre&s;entation of the con&s;equences likely to en&s;ue, from the Lords of the privy-council to the court, they were peremptorily ordered to go on with their work.
<PB N="53" REF="56">The oppo&s;ers publi&s;hed their rea&s;ons; two petitions were pre&s;ented again&s;t it to the Lord Chancellor and Council, one from all the men, women, children and &s;ervants of Edinburgh, another in the names of the noblemen, barons, gentry, mini&s;ters and burge&s;&s;es, which were tran&s;mitted to the King, who, in&s;tead of re|turning a &s;oft an&s;wer, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t the late tumults, forbidding all a&s;&s;emblies or convocations of people to frame or &s;ign petitions, upon pain of high trea&s;on, and ordering the term or &s;e&s;&s;ion to be moved from Linlithgow to Stirling, twenty-four miles from Edinburgh, with a &s;trict injunction that no &s;tranger &s;hould re&s;ort thither without &s;pecial licence. Upon the publication of this proclamation, &s;undry noble|men, mini&s;ters and others, &s;igned a prote&s;t; four TABLES, as they were called, were erected at Edin|burgh, one of the nobility, another of the gentry, a third of the burroughs, and a fourth of the mini&s;ters. The&s;e prepared matters for <HI>the general Table,</HI> formed of commi&s;&s;ioners from the other &s;our, where the la&s;t and binding re&s;olutions were taken. One of the fir&s;t things tran&s;acted by the&s;e tables, was the renewing their confe&s;&s;ion of faith and &s;olemn league and covenant, which had been &s;ub&s;cribed by King James, March 2, 1580-1, and by the whole Scots nation in the year 1590. To this covenant was now added, a narrative of &s;undry acts of parliament, by which the religion of the reformed had been ratified &s;ince that time, with an admonition, wherein the late innovations were re|nounced, and a band of defence for adhering to each other in the pre&s;ent cau&s;e. This &s;olemn league and covenant, in &s;upport of their religious and civil liber|ties, and in oppo&s;ition to Popery, tyranny and oppre&s;|&s;ion, was &s;worn to and &s;ub&s;cribed with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion, fir&s;t at Edinburgh, in Feb. 1637-8, and afterwards in all places of the kingdom, where it was received by the common people as a &s;acred oracle,
<PB N="54" REF="57">and &s;ub&s;cribed by all who had any zeal for the Pro|te&s;tant religion and their country.</P>
<P>Hereupon the King &s;ent the Marquis of Hamilton as his high commi&s;&s;ioner into Scotland, one part of his commi&s;&s;ion being to induce them to give up the covenant, upon which he was to con&s;ent to the calling a general a&s;&s;embly or parliament; but the covenanters declared they would &s;ooner renounce their bapti&s;m than their covenant. Finding them full of this re&s;olution, and nothing to be done but by force of arms, he re|turned to England: but was &s;oon &s;ent back again, and in&s;tructed, if nece&s;&s;ity required, to revoke the liturgy, canons, the high commi&s;&s;ion, and the five ar|ticles of Perth. He might call a general a&s;&s;embly and parliament within a competent time, but was to endeavour to exclude the laity from the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>On Nov. 21, 1638, the Marquis publi&s;hed a pro|clamation for a general a&s;&s;embly, to meet at Gla&s;gow. The covenanters carried their elections every where, a &s;ilenced mini&s;ter, Mr. Hender&s;on, was cho&s;en mo|derator; and though the Bi&s;hops pre&s;ented a <HI>Declinator,</HI> declaring the a&s;&s;embly to be unlawful, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Marquis, finding them not of a proper temper for the court, di&s;&s;olved them, after having pre&s;ided &s;even days, forbidding them to continue their &s;e&s;&s;ions upon pain of high trea&s;on, the a&s;&s;embly continued &s;itting, and next day publi&s;hed a ju&s;tification of their proceed|ings. They &s;at for &s;ome weeks, till they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal acts, viz. An act <HI>for di&s;annulling &s;ix late a&s;&s;em|blies, viz. tho&s;e of</HI> 1606, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, <HI>with the rea&s;ons:</HI> An act <HI>for abjuring and aboli&s;hing epi&s;copacy:</HI> An act <HI>for condemning the five articles of Perth:</HI> An act <HI>for condemning the &s;ervice book, book of canons, book of ordination, and the high commi&s;&s;ion:</HI> An act <HI>for condemn|ing Archdeacons, Chapters, and preaching Deacons:</HI> An act <HI>for re&s;toring Presbyteries, provincial and national a&s;&s;em|blies, to their con&s;titution of mini&s;ters and elders, and to their power and juri&s;diction contained in the book of policy;</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="58">with many others of like nature. They afterwards pro|nounced &s;entence of depo&s;ition again&s;t the Bi&s;hops; eight of whom were excommunicated, four excluded from the mini&s;terial function, and two only allowed to officiate as pa&s;tors or pre&s;byters. At the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the a&s;&s;embly drew up a letter to the King, complaining of the Marquis of Hamilton, who had proclaimed them traitors, and forbid the people to pay any regard to their acts; and praying him &s;till to look upon them as good and faithful &s;ubjects. They pub|li&s;hed al&s;o an addre&s;s to the good people of England, in their own vindication, which the King &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t the covenanters.</P>
<P>Thus matters between the King and his Scotti&s;h &s;ub|jects were brought to &s;uch a cri&s;is as could not but end in a war. Charles fitted out a fleet of &s;ixteen &s;hips, and rai&s;ed an army of 21,000 hor&s;e and foot. On the other hand, the covenanters &s;ecured the ca&s;tles of Edin|burgh. Dumbritton and Frith, rai&s;ed an army, and &s;ent for their old General Le&s;ley, from Germany, who brought with him many experienced officers. On the the 27th of March 1639, the King marched north|wards, and was met, upon the borders by the Scots army; but after facing each other, for &s;ome time, the King perceiving his Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant nobility and &s;oldiers not hearty in the cau&s;e, came to a pacification with the covenanters, June 17, by which all points of difference were referred to a general a&s;&s;embly, to be held at Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 12 en&s;uing, and to a par|liament which was to meet a fortnight after. Both armies, in the interim, were to be di&s;banded; the tables broke up, and no meetings held, but &s;uch as were warranted by act of parliament. The King ac|cordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his army, &s;carcely affording thanks to them for their affection and loyalty. The Scots delivered up the King's ca&s;tles and forts, and di&s;banded their troops; but cautiou&s;ly kept their officers in pay.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59">The general a&s;&s;embly met according to the treaty, at Edinburgh; but being con&s;tituted as the la&s;t, the King having given up the point of the lay-elders, the Bi&s;hops, who pre&s;ented another <HI>Declinator,</HI> were ex|cu&s;ed attendance by the King. The a&s;&s;embly then, without any oppo&s;ition, confirmed the proceedings of that of Gla&s;gow, appointed the covenant to be taken throughout the kingdom, voted away the new &s;ervice|book, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> determined that <HI>dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy was unlawful, and not to be al|lowed in their kirk.</HI></P>
<P>The parliament met Aug 31, and confirmed all the acts of the general a&s;&s;embly; but having mentioned epi&s;copacy as <HI>unlawful,</HI> the King forbid the Earl of Traquair, his commi&s;&s;ioner, to con&s;ent to the word, le&s;t it &s;hould be interpreted ab&s;olutely; whereupon he fir&s;t prorogued the parliament for fourteen days, and then, by the King's expre&s;s command, for nine months, without ratifying any of their acts.</P>
<P>The pacification between the King and the Scots was not of long duration; for, pu&s;hed on by Laud and Strafford, he re&s;olved to humble his northern &s;ubjects, who had dared to di&s;pute his prerogative. The Scots dreading the impending &s;torm, were, many of them, for &s;eeking &s;uccour from France; and accordingly wrote a letter to the King of France, which however was not &s;ent. The majority of the Scots nation ca&s;t their eye towards the Engli&s;h parliament, which was called together to aid in their de&s;truction, and met April 13, 1640, and, upon application to their friends at London, were a&s;&s;ured, by a letter written by Lord Saville, "That the hearts of the people of England were with them; that they were convinced the liberties of both nations were at &s;take, and there|fore they might depend upon their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;oon as a fair opportunity offered." Upon this a&s;&s;urance the Scots re&s;olved to rai&s;e another army, and to march into England. Mean time Charles, not meeting
<PB N="57" REF="60">with a behaviour he expected, di&s;&s;olved the parlia|ment, and, to carry on the war again&s;t the Scots, &s;et every engine of arbitrary power at work, &s;uch as loans, benevolences, &s;hip-money, &amp;c. &amp;c. by which he got an army together compo&s;ed of Papi&s;ts and pre&s;&s;ed men, who had no affection for the &s;ervice. However, with this army the King met the Scots upon the borders; but &s;oon found that the Engli&s;h nobility were not for conquering them. After a &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;h the Scots army pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed, Aug. 21, and on the 30th took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newca&s;tle, whil&s;t the King retreated before them as far as York, leaving them ma&s;ters of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Durham, from which counties they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted their army, and levied what contributions they plea&s;ed. When they entered Newca&s;tle, they &s;ent an expre&s;s to a&s;&s;ure the city of Lon|don, that they would not interrupt the trade between it and that town, but would cultivate all manner of friend|&s;hip and brotherly corre&s;pondence. They al&s;o di&s;|patched me&s;&s;engers to the King, petitioning his Maje&s;ty "to confirm their late acts of parliament, re&s;tore their &s;hips and merchandi&s;e, recal his proclamation which &s;tiles them rebels, and call an Engli&s;h parliament, to &s;ettle the peace between both kingdoms." This petition was backed by others from &s;everal of the Engli&s;h no|bility and the city of London. The King finding he mu&s;t come to terms, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Scots at Rippon, who agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for three months, from Oct. 26; the Scots to have 850l. <HI>per diem,</HI> for the maintenance of the army, and the treaty to be adjourned to London, where a free parliament was to be immediately called. This famous long parliament was opened Nov. 3, in which the late commi&s;&s;ioners exhibited articles again&s;t Archbi&s;hop Laud, and, by co-operating with them in their oppo&s;ition to the King's mea&s;ures and mini&s;ters, contributed greatly to their future &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t mo|narchy and epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">In the year 1641, when King Charles was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the vigorous proceedings of the parlia|ment of England again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and other grie|vances, knowing they were greatly encouraged therein by their confederacy with the Scots, who&s;e army in the north was entirely in their intere&s;t, it was re&s;olved in council, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;unite that nation from the parliament, and bring them over to the King, by granting them all their de&s;ires; and for that purpo&s;e he re&s;olved upon a progre&s;s into Scotland. Aug. 10 the King &s;et out po&s;t, and arrived there in three or four days; but the Engli&s;h parliament, aware of his de&s;ign, appointed one lord and two commoners to follow his Maje&s;ty, in order to keep up a good corre&s;pondence with the parliament of that nation. Aug. 19, he opened the parliament there with a very conciliating &s;peech, and agreeable thereto he allowed of their late oppo&s;ition to the liturgy, and their erecting <HI>Tables;</HI> he confirmed the acts of the a&s;&s;embly at Gla&s;gow; he followed their manner of wor&s;hip, conferred titles upon many of their gentry; and, when he left the kingdom, all parties &s;eemed contented. But, from all accounts, the King &s;oon repented of his com|pliances, and as to the Scots, they &s;till thought them|&s;elves obliged to cultivate a good under&s;tanding: with the Engli&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>The Scots, now ea&s;y at home, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their religious and civil rights, yet did not look with indifference upon affairs in England, and dread|ed the ruin of the Engli&s;h parliament, as well through gratitude for the favours they had received from them, as for their future &s;afety; and therefore the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners at London offered their mediation be|tween the King and the two hou&s;es, telling his Maje&s;ty, in their petition, "That the liberties of England and Scotland mu&s;t &s;tand and fall together," and be&s;eeching him "to have recour&s;e to the faithful advices of both hou&s;es of parliament, which will not only quiet the minds of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, but remove the jealou|&s;ies
<PB N="59" REF="62">and fears that may po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of his &s;ubjects in his other kingdoms." In their addre&s;s to the Eng|li&s;h parliament they acknowledge their obligations to them, and be&s;eech the two hou&s;es "to con&s;ider of the faire&s;t and mo&s;t likely methods to compo&s;e the diffe|rences in church and &s;tate." Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays, their de&s;ign was to get Epi&s;copacy brought down, and Pre&s;bytery &s;et up; to the "fir&s;t of which mo&s;t of the members were willing to con&s;ent, but few were cordial for the latter."</P>
<P>The King was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Scots medi|ation, and commanded them not to tran&s;act between him and his parliament, without fir&s;t communicating their propo&s;itions to him, in private; and in Scotland he u&s;ed methods to keep that kingdom neutral. On the other hand, the parliament threw them&s;elves into the arms of the Scots, they thanked the commi&s;&s;ioners for their kind and &s;ea&s;onable interpo&s;ing, and prayed them to continue their endeavours to remove the pre|&s;ent di&s;tractions, and to pre&s;erve the union between the two kingdoms. They writ to Scotland al&s;o to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In May 1642, they again renewed their offers of a mediation, which the King rejected as be|fore; but the parliament accepted of it, and &s;eemed to come heartily into their &s;cheme of church-government, &s;o that a perfect union took place between the two king|doms. The King alarmed hereat, &s;ent a warm re|mon&s;trance to the council of Scotland, Augu&s;t 26, wherein he very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that "the parliament no more believed the <HI>divine in&s;titution of Pre&s;bytery,</HI> than the others did of <HI>dioce&s;an Prelacy;</HI> for though they were content, in order to &s;ecure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots nation, to vote away the hierarchy of Arch|bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, yet when they had conquered the King, and had nothing to fear from their neighbours, they could not be prevailed with to e&s;tabli&s;h the Scots Pre&s;bytery, without a re&s;erve of the power of the keys to them&s;elves."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">It is foreign to my purpo&s;e to enter too deeply into the civil and military hi&s;tory of this unfortunate reign, further than to elucidate the hi&s;tory of the kirk of Scotland; and therefore I &s;hall next take notice, that, in the year 1643, the general a&s;&s;embly of Scotland agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Engli&s;h for the recovery of their civil and religious liberties, and appointed delegates to the a&s;&s;em|bly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter. On Sept. 25, the Eng|li&s;h hou&s;e of Commons and the a&s;&s;embly of divines, to &s;ecure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots, took the &s;olemn league and covenant, after many debates in relation to the renunciation of Epi&s;copacy, and &s;ome other points, by &s;ub&s;cribing their names thereto, the hou&s;e of Com|mons in one parchment-roll, and the a&s;&s;embly in an|other, in St. Margaret's church, We&s;tmin&s;ter. On the Sunday following it was tendered to all per&s;ons within the bills of mortality, after being read in the &s;everal churches. October 15, it was likewi&s;e taken by the hou&s;e of Lords. In Scotland it was inforced, all over the kingdom, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties. February 1644, it was ordered to be taken through|out the kingdom of England, by all per&s;ons above the age of eighteen years, an exhortation from the We&s;t|min&s;ter a&s;&s;embly of divines being drawn up and pub|li&s;hed for that purpo&s;e. The greate&s;t number were zealous for the covenant on a religious account, and others in obedience to the parliament, being con|vinced of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of their affairs, and that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots was to be obtained upon no other terms. The impo&s;ing it as a te&s;t, however, was far from being ju&s;tifiable, for &s;everal evident rea&s;ons. The King publi&s;hed a declaration again&s;t it in England, and &s;ent one, to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, into Scotland, which had no other effect than to produce the rea&s;ons for their conduct, and advice to his Maje&s;ty to take the covenant him&s;elf.</P>

<P>The King's affairs becoming de&s;perate, on the 27th of April 1646, he e&s;caped from Oxford, and threw him&s;elf into the hands of the Scots army, then lying before Newark. Little or nothing occurred relative to the kirk during the nine months the King continued with the Scots, but altercations between them and the Engli&s;h parliament and a&s;&s;embly, relative to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Pre&s;bytery and toleration of Separati&s;ts in England, which the Pre&s;byterians now as much in|veighed again&s;t, as ever the Papi&s;ts, or church of Eng|land had done in Queen Elizabeth's days. "We are per&s;uaded, &s;ays the parliament of Scotland, that the piety and wi&s;dom of the honourable hou&s;es will never admit toleration of any &s;ects or &s;chi&s;ms, contrary to our &s;olemn league and covenant."</P>
<P>The King, determining not to aboli&s;h Epi&s;copacy, and with&s;tanding the &s;olicitations and prayers of his friends, nay even the advice of his Queen, all attempts at an accommodation with his parliament proved abor|tive; therefore, as the clergy of Scotland would not &s;uffer him to come into that kingdom, unle&s;s he took the &s;olemn league and covenant, and did all they de|&s;ired, and their parliament re&s;olved the kingdom &s;hould be &s;ecured without him, and that <HI>they &s;hould leave the King in England to his two hou&s;es of parliament,</HI> upon their agreeing to pay the Scots army their arrears, and 200,000l. one moiety thereof on the delivering up the King into the hands of the Engli&s;h parliament's com|mi&s;&s;ioners,

<P>The further tran&s;actions of this reign have very little relation to the affairs of the kirk of Scotland, who were entirely aver&s;e to the &s;ecret treaty with the King, in pur&s;uance of which Duke Hamilton marched into England with an army, and was defeated at Pre&s;ton by Cromwell, after which he marched triumphantly to Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 17, 1648.

<P>In June 1650, the Commonwealth of England having departed from the &s;olemn league and covenant, the Scots, who at the King's death proclaimed the Prince of Wales, entered into a treaty with the exiled King at Breda, &s;ubjecting him thereby to the following very mortifying conditions: That all per&s;ons excom|municated by the kirk, &s;hould be forbid the court: that the King, by his &s;olemn oath, and under his hand and &s;eal, declare his allowance of the covenant: that he confirm tho&s;e acts of parliament which enjoin the covenant: that he e&s;tabli&s;h the Pre&s;byterian wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and &s;wear never to oppo&s;e or endeavour to alter them: that all civil matters be determined by parliament; and all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs by the kirk: that his Maje&s;ty ratify all that has been done in the parliament of Scotland, in &s;ome late &s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;ign the covenant upon his arrival in that kingdom, if the kirk de&s;ired it. He arrived June 16, but was obliged to &s;ign both the covenants before he &s;et his feet on &s;hore. The Covenanters rai&s;ed an army of 16,000 foot and 6000 hor&s;e for his &s;ervice; whereupon the Engli&s;h parliament &s;ent General Cromwell again&s;t them, who entered Scotland, at the latter end of July, with an army of 11,000 foot and 5000 hor&s;e.

<P>The Scots committees of the kirk and e&s;tates having fled to Stirling, and being joined by tho&s;e who had e&s;ca|ped from Dunbar, endeavoured to a&s;&s;emble another body of forces; but they were &s;o divided among&s;t them|&s;elves that little was done to the purpo&s;e. The ruling party was for the King and kirk; the <HI>Re&s;olutioners</HI> were &s;o called from their adhering to the re&s;olution of the kirk and &s;tates, "that tho&s;e who had been too back|ward, ought to be admitted to make profe&s;&s;ion of their repentance, and afterwards, in the pre&s;ent extremity, might be admitted to defend and &s;erve their country:" The <HI>Prote&s;ters</HI> prote&s;ted again&s;t this re&s;olution: the <HI>Remon&s;trators,</HI> in the we&s;tern counties, formed an a&s;|&s;ociation apart, as well again&s;t the King and the defec|tion in the kirk party, as again&s;t the army of &s;ectaries. Whil&s;t the&s;e debated and wrangled, Cromwell reduced Darlington hou&s;e, Ro&s;lan ca&s;tle, and obtained a victory over the Remon&s;trators, at Hamilton.

<P>January 1, 1650-1, the Covenanters crowned the King at Scoone, who &s;et up his &s;tandard at Aberdeen, whil&s;t the Engli&s;h reduced Hume and Tantallon ca&s;tles.
<PB N="64" REF="67">The King having got together an army of 20,000 men, encamped at Torwood near Stirling, and afterwards at Kel&s;yth, from which &s;ituations all Cromwell's general&s;hip could not draw him to an engagement; hereupon he reduced Calendar hou&s;e in &s;ight of their army, and af|terwards a detachment of his army cro&s;&s;ing to Fife, de|feated a &s;trong body of Scots with great &s;laughter. This overthrow threw the Scots army into much con|&s;ternation, which decamped and marched into Stirling park, whil&s;t detachments from the Engli&s;h army made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Brunti&s;land and St. John&s;town, by which it hindered any &s;upply of men and provi&s;ions being &s;ent from the Highlands to the King's army. The King thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, a re&s;olution was taken to make an irruption into England, and, on the la&s;t of July 1651, he began his march from Stirling for that purpo&s;e, and on the 6th of Augu&s;t entered this kingdom by the way of Carli&s;le, which cau&s;ed great con&s;ternation to the powers at We&s;tmin&s;ter.

<P>Major-General Monk, whom Cromwell had left to command in Scotland, &s;oon fini&s;hed the reduction of that kingdom, after which, for eight years, it enjoyed a &s;tate of calm, under the u&s;urpation; a &s;trong Eng|li&s;h army was kept there under good pay and good di&s;cipline, a &s;ort of union of the three kingdoms took place, in one parliament, to which the Scots &s;ent their repre&s;entatives, and tho&s;e eight years were reckon|ed a time of peace and pro&s;perity to Scotland, as Bi&s;hop Burnet ob&s;erves. As to the power of the kirk, it was reduced into a narrow compa&s;s
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;tory of the Puritans, vol. iv. p. 53.</NOTE>; "for though they had the liberty to excommunicate offenders, or debar them the communion, they might not &s;eize their

No oaths or covenants were to be impo&s;ed but by direction from We&s;tmin&s;ter; and as all fitting encouragement was to be given to the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed kirk, &s;o others, not &s;atisfied with their form of church-government, had liberty to &s;erve God after their own manner; and tho&s;e who would live peaceably, and yield obedience to the commonwealth, were protected in their &s;everal per&s;ua&s;ions. This oc|ca&s;ioned a great commotion among the clergy, who complained "of the lo&s;s of their covenant and church|di&s;cipline, and exclaimed again&s;t the toleration, as opening a door to all kinds of error and here&s;y." The parliament of England &s;ending Independent commi&s;|&s;ioners to vi&s;it the Scots univer&s;ities, and to &s;ettle li|berty of con&s;cience, the a&s;&s;embly at Edinburgh pub|li&s;hed a <HI>Te&s;timony again&s;t the pre&s;ent incroachments of the civil power upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction.</HI> When the general a&s;&s;embly met again at Edinburgh, and were ju&s;t entering upon bu&s;ine&s;s, Colonel Cotterel told them, that no eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatories were to &s;it there but by authority of the parliament of England; and without giving them leave to reply, he commanded them to retire, conducted them out of the we&s;t-gate of the city, with a troop of hor&s;e, and a company of foot, and having taken away the commi&s;&s;ions from the &s;eve|ral cla&s;&s;es, injoined them not to a&s;&s;emble any more above three in a company.</P>
<P>In 1654, Oliver Cromwell Protector, the kingdom of Scotland was, by his ordinance, incorporated with England into one-commonwealth, and provi&s;ion made, that in every parliament thirty members &s;hould be call|ed from thence to &s;erve for Scotland.</P>
<P>Upon the re&s;toration of Charles II. a parliament be|ing cho&s;en according to the mind of the court, all went again&s;t the Covenanters; Epi&s;copacy was re&s;tored, and Deacons, Prie&s;ts, and Bi&s;hops, ordained and con&s;ecrated, according to the rites of the church of England. All
<PB N="66" REF="69">this was performed by the &s;ole virtue of the King's pre|rogative (for it was not till the next year that a parlia|ment decided the matter) in breach of the &s;olemn league and covenant, which he had, indeed, been <HI>forced</HI> to take. Several of the Scots mini&s;ters preach|ed boldly again&s;t the&s;e mea&s;ures; for which Mr. James Guthrie, mini&s;ter of Stirling, was convicted of &s;edition and trea&s;on, and executed June 14, 1661, dying with all the holy confidence of a Chri&s;tian, and the fortitude of a martyr. A young officer who &s;uffered with him, in the &s;ame cau&s;e, made u&s;e of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions: "I bear witne&s;s with my blood, to the per&s;ecuted govern|ment of this church, by &s;ynods and pre&s;byteries; I bear witne&s;s to the &s;olemn league and covenant, and &s;eal it with my blood. I likewi&s;e te&s;tify again&s;t all Popery, Prelacy, Idolatry, Super&s;tition, and the Service Book, which is no better than a relick of Popi&s;h idolatry." Soon afterwards the rights of patronages were re&s;tored, and all the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters &s;ilenced, though the court had not a &s;upply of men of any &s;ort to fill the vacancies occa&s;ioned thereby. The &s;ilenced clergy had been mo&s;t exemplary in their lives and conver&s;ations, con&s;tant preachers, and expounders, indefatigable in the di&s;charge of their functions, and almo&s;t adored by the people, though they kept up a very &s;evere di&s;ci|pline in the church: but their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors the Bi&s;hops and clergy were of a quite different &s;tamp; mo&s;t of them very mean divines, vicious in their morals, idle and negligent of their cures; &s;o that they became ob|noxious to the whole nation, and could hardly, even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil power, &s;upport their au|thority. The people, generally of the Pre&s;byterian per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;tood firm by one another, for&s;ook the churches, and many of them were thrown into pri&s;on, and ill u&s;ed, &s;ome were fined, and the younger &s;ort whipped about the &s;treets; &s;o that great numbers tran&s;|ported them&s;elves to Ul&s;ter in Ireland, where they
<PB N="67" REF="70">were well received, and where their po&s;terity flouri&s;h to this day.</P>
<P>In 1666, Sir James Turner being &s;ent into the We&s;t, to levy fines at di&s;cretion, the people ro&s;e in arms, and took him and all his &s;oldiers pri&s;oners; but were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed by the King's forces, forty of them killed, and 130 taken pri&s;oners, many of whom were hanged before their own doors. Their mini&s;ter was put to the torture, and died with great firmne&s;s, crying out, "Farewel &s;un, moon, and &s;tars; farewel kindred and friends, world and time, and this weak and frail body; and welcome eternity, welcome angels and &s;aints, welcome Saviour of the world, and God the judge of all!" Conventicles abounded in all parts; the Pre&s;|byterian mini&s;ters preached in their own hou&s;es to the people, who &s;tood without doors to hear them; and when di&s;per&s;ed by the magi&s;trates, they went out into the fields, to hear the word, carrying arms with them for their defence. A &s;evere act was publi&s;hed again&s;t hou&s;e and field conventicles; but the people &s;till met together in defiance of the law: and many, who were called Cameronians, from Cameron their preacher, were outlawed, and therefore left their habitations, and travelled about the country: at length, collecting them&s;elves into a body, they were routed by the Duke of Monmouth, at Bothwell-bridge, 400 of them killed, and 1200 taken pri&s;oners. Two of their mini&s;ters were hanged, and 200 bani&s;hed to the plantations, who were all lo&s;t at &s;ea. In &s;hort, a per&s;ecution &s;pread thro' the i&s;land, during the greate&s;t part of this reign, almo&s;t as cruelly and oppre&s;&s;ively carried on as the Romi&s;h inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The parliament that met at Edinburgh, upon the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of James II. in 1685, very compliantly de|clared their abhorrence of all principles derogatory of the King's ab&s;olute power, and offered their lives and fortunes to &s;upport it, again&s;t all oppo&s;ers. They de|clared it high trea&s;on to give or take the national cove|nant,
<PB N="68" REF="71">or even to write in defence of it; and pa&s;&s;ed an act, whereby it was made death to re&s;ort to any field or hou&s;e conventicles. They likewi&s;e obliged the &s;ubjects of Scotland to take an oath, when &s;o re|quired to do, to maintain the King's <HI>ab&s;olute power,</HI> on pain of bani&s;hment. Popery began now to lift up its head in that kingdom, and &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction changed to that religion, and accommodated them|&s;elves to the times for the &s;ake of private intere&s;t. The populace, on the other hand, were very tumultuous; they broke into the Earl of Perth's private chapel for ma&s;s, and defaced and de&s;troyed all they could lay their hands on, for which one of them was taken and hanged. When the King di&s;pen&s;ed with the penal laws and te&s;ts, the Scots parliament agreed to a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of them for the King's life; but James in&s;i&s;t|ing upon an entire repeal, which they had firmne&s;s to oppo&s;e, he di&s;&s;olved them, with tokens of re&s;entment. The Epi&s;copal clergy, who were ob&s;equious &s;laves to the court, were &s;unk into &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;loth and ig|norance, as to render their hearers, particularly the common people, quite indifferent to the affairs of re|ligion: but the Pre&s;byterians, on the other hand, &s;eemed to have gained new &s;trength from per&s;ecution, and though, by the King's di&s;pen&s;ing power, freed, in 1687, from the &s;everities under which they had for &s;o many years &s;uffered, it did not cool their zeal again&s;t Popery; their aver&s;ion to that corrupt church was more and more apparent: their oppo&s;ition, at length, rou&s;ed the whole nation from the lethargy into which it was apparently &s;unk. Their behaviour at this critical time, when it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, after they had fared &s;o ill, that they would with joy and without re&s;erve have fallen in with the mea&s;ures of the King, which gave them pre&s;ent relief from their burdens, will ever redound to the honour of the church of Scotland, and evince that the principles of religion, firmly fixed and rooted in the heart, are e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent
<PB N="69" REF="72">from mere profe&s;&s;ions, which generally change with the times, and give no &s;tability or firmne&s;s to tho&s;e who embrace them. The Scots perceived, that the King's view in taking off the penal laws and te&s;ts was only to &s;erve the Papi&s;ts; and therefore, when pre&s;&s;ed by him to concur in that mea&s;ure, they very wi&s;ely an&s;wered in cold and general terms.</P>
<P>At length, the per&s;ecuted, the &s;uffering church of Scotland, was redeemed from its perils by the Revolu|tion, which had re&s;tored liberty and religion in its &s;i&s;ter kingdom. On the 11th of April 1689 a convention, like that in England, for &s;ettling the government, was called in Scotland, which pa&s;&s;ed judgment of forfeiture on King James, and voted King William and Queen Mary, King and Queen of Scotland. One article of the claim of rights they drew up, was, that "the refor|mation in Scotland having been begun by a parity a|mong the clergy, prelacy in the church was a great and in&s;upportable grievance to the kingdom." As the Bi&s;hops and Epi&s;copalians left the convention, becau&s;e not &s;ummoned by the abdicated King, and continued to adhere to him, the Pre&s;byterians carried all before them. The malecontents &s;ent for King James to come into Scotland, and the Earl of Dundee got together a con&s;iderable army of Highlanders; but was routed by General Mackay, at Killicrankey, and the Earl him&s;elf &s;lain. Thus, with King James, Epi&s;copacy was bani&s;hed from Scotland, and the kirk-di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip re&s;tored; without a toleration, however, to Di&s;&s;enters from that church.</P>
<P>By the act of union, for uniting the two kingdoms into one, anno 1707, the filth year of Queen Anne, by the name of Great Britain, it was enacted, that the Pre&s;byterian church-government is to remain e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in Scotland; but by the 10th of Anne, cap. 7, that it &s;hall be lawful for tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal communion in Scotland, to a&s;&s;emble for divine wor&s;hip, to be per|formed by pa&s;tors ordained by Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="70" REF="73">without di&s;turbance, except in pari&s;h-churches: &s;uch pa&s;tors of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion to exhibit their orders at the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace, and the &s;ame to be regi&s;tered, paying one &s;hilling One hundred pounds penalty to be levied on any di&s;turber of their congre|gations: their pa&s;tors to baptize and marry, provided the chri&s;tenings be regi&s;tered, and banns three times publi&s;hed in the Epi&s;copal congregation. No pain or forfeiture to be incurred by any per&s;on, on any excom|munication by the church-judicatories in Scotland. Mini&s;ters are to pray for the royal family. By cap. 12. patrons of churches, &amp;c. are re&s;tored to their right of pre&s;entation. By act 5 Geo. I. cap. 29, provi&s;ion was made for rendering more effectual the laws ap|pointing the oaths for the &s;ecurity of the government to be taken by mini&s;ters and preachers in churches and meeting hou&s;es in Scotland: and by act 9 Geo. I. cap. 24, Papi&s;ts and Nonjurors are obliged to regi&s;ter their e&s;tates. The&s;e are the principal provi&s;ions made &s;ince the union, relative to religious affairs in Scotland, where, under the mild and au&s;picious &s;way of the illu|&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover, the church has long enjoy|ed that repo&s;e it in vain &s;ought and &s;truggled for un|der many of their predece&s;&s;ors, and all per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake is laid a&s;ide. With religious and civil liberty, learning, arts, and &s;ciences flouri&s;h, politene&s;s and civility every where reign, and her clergy and u|niver&s;ities have abounded with elegant and fine writers, in every branch of literature, who have done credit to humanity, and &s;pread the reputation of their country to the remote&s;t parts of the world.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome internal differences and divi&s;ions have happened in the church of Scotland, from the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories of which a <HI>Sece&s;&s;ion</HI> has taken place; the hi&s;tory of which, and the &s;chi&s;ms in that &s;ece&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall now give (before I enter upon my account of the doctrine and di&s;cipline of that church) excellently drawn up by a reverend divine of
<PB N="71" REF="74">Haddington, who has therein pre&s;erved a Chri&s;tian temper, and a laudable moderation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sece&s;&s;ion</HI> from the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories of the church of Scotland took place, in con&s;equence of a continued cour&s;e of offences to the &s;trict party therein. The&s;e, like their ance&s;tors, zealou&s;ly adhered to the We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith, catechi&s;m and form of Pre&s;byterian church-government; they maintaining the binding obligation of the Scots covenant, and of the &s;olemn league and covenant of the three nations; they allowed the civil magi&s;trate a &s;overeignty over all church-members in all civil cau&s;es, but refu&s;ed that he had any &s;piritual head&s;hip over her doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline or government; hence they conceived no &s;mall di&s;gu&s;t at their clergy for &s;o tamely yielding to the di&s;&s;olution or prorogation of their general a&s;&s;embly by King William and Queen Anne; they were exceedingly grieved with the Scots parliament for con&s;enting that the perpetual e&s;tabli&s;hment of prelacy in England &s;hould be an e&s;&s;ential condition of the union between the two kingdoms, and afterwards with the Briti&s;h for re&s;toring the power of patrons in the &s;ettlement of mini&s;ters; the former accounted a mo&s;t &s;inful burying of the &s;olemn league, whereby the Scots not only &s;wore again&s;t prelacy them&s;elves, but al&s;o to endeavour the reformation of England from it; the latter they dete&s;ted, as annexing the &s;piritual privileges of the church to civil rights, as if Chri&s;t's kingdom were of this world; as tending to place the management of the church in the hands of Chri&s;t's enemies; as open|ing a door for &s;imoniacal pactions between the patron and pre&s;entee, and for filling the church with an in|dolent, naughty and erroneous mini&s;try: but as the Pre&s;byterian clergy remon&s;trated again&s;t this procedure of the parliament, together with their act for tolera|tion of all &s;orts of opinions except popery and bla&s;|phemy, the people could not take offence at them on the&s;e accounts. It was otherwi&s;e in the affair of the act
<PB N="72" REF="75">impo&s;ing the abjuration oath upon the clergy: the &s;trict Pre&s;byterians, whether mini&s;ters or people, heartily dete&s;ted Popery and the Pretender for its &s;ake; but ob&s;erving that this oath was extended to Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters by Jacobiti&s;h influence, that it was originally calculated for the maintenance of the Engli&s;h church as well as &s;tate; that it referred to two Engli&s;h acts of parliament, requiring the &s;overeign to be of the epi&s;|copal communion; that it implied an approbation of the union &s;ettlement, and con&s;equently of the above|mentioned &s;inful term thereof; that &s;ome of its ex|pre&s;&s;ions were ambiguous and hard to be under&s;tood; that though it was &s;u&s;pected few mini&s;ters would have taken it but for fear of the penalty, yet they were obliged therein to &s;wear they took it heartily and will|ingly. For the&s;e and the like rea&s;ons, many truly loyal, &s;en&s;ible, and godly mini&s;ters declined taking it; and not a few as loyal people declined hearing tho&s;e who took it e&s;pecially where they had acce&s;s to hear &s;uch as did not. Scarce was this woful re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding of the church commenced, when Mr. John Sim&s;on, Profe&s;&s;or of Divinty at Gla&s;gow, being by Mr. James Web&s;ter, mini&s;ter at Edinburgh, proce&s;&s;ed for error before the general a&s;&s;embly, did in his defence and other papers maintain, that Heathens have an implicit di&s;covery of redemption through Chri&s;t; that if they or others do with natural &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s u&s;e the means of happine&s;s God hath given them, they &s;hall certainly obtain &s;aving grace and la&s;ting felicity; that all infants are formed as holy and free of &s;in as Adam was, and dying in non|age &s;hall probably be &s;aved; that no proper covenant of works was made with Adam as the repre&s;entative of his po&s;terity; that our own happine&s;s ought to be our chief end and motive in glorifying God; that there is no immediate divine pre-cour&s;e with the actions of ra|tional creatures; and that there will be no &s;inning in hell after the la&s;t judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="76">After tedious altercations at that and &s;ome former meetings, the a&s;&s;embly of 1717 found the&s;e notions no more than opinions not nece&s;&s;ary to be taught in divi|nity, opinions not evidently founded upon &s;cripture, and &s;ome of them tending to attribute too much to natural rea&s;on and the power of corrupt nature; and prohi|bited him and all others to u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, or teach &s;uch po&s;itions for the future. But the very &s;ame day they declared the following po&s;ition, viz "It is un&s;ound to teach that we mu&s;t for&s;ake our &s;in in order to come to Chri&s;t, and in&s;tating us in covenant with God," mo&s;t un&s;ound and dete&s;table; and thus indirectly declared, that we ought and are able to for&s;ake and &s;ave our&s;elves from the reign and practice of our &s;in, before we come to Je&s;us, the alone Saviour from it. To &s;top the cur|rent of this and other legal doctrines, a new edition of that truly valuable Engli&s;h book, intitled, <HI>The marrow of modern divinity,</HI> was publi&s;hed, with a recommen|datory preface, by Mr. James Hog, one of the holie&s;t mini&s;ters in the kingdom. This book, after it had pa&s;&s;ed for about eighty years with con&s;iderable reputation and e&s;teem among mo&s;t of the truly &s;erious per&s;ons who read it, was attacked with great warmth by the general a&s;&s;embly of 1720; and though it is &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected the greater part of the members had never peru&s;ed it, an act was made, charging all mini&s;ters in connection with them to warn their people again&s;t reading it.&mdash; In their attack upon this book, the a&s;&s;embly plainly condemned the offering of Chri&s;t as a Saviour to &s;in|ners as &s;uch, and the a&s;&s;erting that believers are wholly delivered from the law as a covenant of works: they maintained that holine&s;s is a federal or conditional means of obtaining eternal happine&s;s; and that &s;lavi&s;h fear of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, and legal hope of future felicity, ought to influence the &s;aints in their &s;tudy of go&s;pel holine&s;s: the&s;e almo&s;t entirely &s;criptural expre&s;&s;ions, "That believers are not under the law, do not com|mit &s;in; that the Lord can &s;ee no &s;in in them, nor be
<PB N="74" REF="77">angry with them for &s;in," they declared Antinomian paradoxes; and condemned, the di&s;tingui&s;hing between the law as a covenant of works, and as a binding rule of obedience in the hand of a Mediator, in order to explain them: Me&s;&s;. Thomas Bo&s;ton, Ebenezer and Ralph Er&s;kines, with nine others, remon&s;trated again&s;t this conduct: the&s;e twelve repre&s;enters had their own &s;hare of trouble from the judicatories; the commi&s;&s;ion po&s;ed them with twelve que&s;tions relative to the affair in di&s;pute, in the an&s;wers to which they &s;et &s;everal go&s;pel truths in a very clear light. The a&s;&s;embly of 1722 took the matter into further con&s;ideration, and made an act explaining and confirming the acts of 1720: this the repre&s;enters prote&s;ted again&s;t as &s;till injurious to the truths of the go&s;pel, though it mu&s;t be owned it was not near &s;o gro&s;s as tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;em|bly of 1720. To avoid even the mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches towards favouring the condemned &s;entiments or ex|pre&s;&s;ions of <HI>the marrow,</HI> many of the Scots clergy &s;eemed now to become more legal in their doctrine than ever, which tempted multitudes of &s;erious Chri&s;|tians to crowd to hear the repre&s;enters, who, notwith|&s;tanding di&s;tingui&s;hed holine&s;s in practice, and a zealous warmth in recommending it to their hearers, were exceedingly reproached as Antinomian encoura|gers of a licentious life.&mdash;It is probable the&s;e twelve mini&s;ters harra&s;&s;ment and reproach had been more la&s;ting, had not a rumour &s;pread, in the end of 1725, that Mr. John Sim&s;on above-mentioned had not only continued to teach his former errors contrary to the prohibition of the a&s;&s;embly, but had taught that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent; that the per&s;ons of the Godhead are not the very &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance; that nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence, &s;upreme deity and being the only true God, may be taken for the per&s;onal property of the Father, and &s;o not belonging to the Son and Holy Gho&s;t. The teaching of his former errors was fully proved, but nothing was done to him upon that account: his teaching the above Arian tenets was al&s;o &s;ufficiently
<PB N="75" REF="78">manife&s;ted; but he, giving in declarations of his &s;enti|ments on the&s;e heads in orthodox language, and after much tergiver&s;ation, profe&s;&s;ing &s;orrow for &s;ome of the offen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions proved again&s;t him; the a&s;&s;embly of 1728 &s;u&s;pended him from the exerci&s;e of all eccle&s;ia&s;tic power and function till another general a&s;&s;embly &s;hould think fit to take off this &s;entence. The a&s;&s;embly of 1729 further declared that it was not fit to intru&s;t him any more with training up of young men for the holy mini&s;try: multitudes were offended he was &s;o &s;lightly cen&s;ured. During this proce&s;s pa&s;tors began to be violently obtruded upon reclaiming congregations; and the a&s;&s;embly of 1730 enacted, that no prote&s;ts nor di&s;&s;ents &s;hould be recorded in their minutes; again&s;t which, and other corruptions, about forty mini&s;ters, and four|teen hundred elders and private Chri&s;tians, gave in a warm remon&s;trance, and craved the a&s;&s;embly would a&s;&s;ert the truth, in direct oppo&s;ition to Mr. Sim&s;on's errors. The a&s;&s;embly of 1732 refu&s;ed to hear the&s;e re|pre&s;entations, and, contrary to in&s;tructions from the far greater part of the Pre&s;byteries who &s;ent any, enacted, that Prote&s;tant heritors, whether prelatic Jacobites or not, and elders, &s;hould be the only voters in the elec|tion of go&s;pel mini&s;ters: the a&s;&s;embly of 1733 di&s;|charged the Pre&s;bytery of Dunfermline, under pain of the highe&s;t cen&s;ure, to admini&s;ter &s;ealing ordi|nances to tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences could not &s;ubmit to the mini&s;try of pa&s;tors violently impo&s;ed upon them. Mean while Mr. Ebenezer Er&s;kine above|mentioned, having, in his &s;ermon before the &s;ynod at Perth, October 1732, te&s;tified again&s;t the act of the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly relative to the choice of mini&s;ters, and having decried patronage and &s;ome other prevalent corruptions, the &s;ynod, after three days di&s;pute, appointed him to be rebuked at their bar, for the matter and manner of his conduct: twelve mini&s;ters and two elders di&s;&s;ented: him&s;elf appealed to the a&s;&s;embly in 1733, but received no redre&s;s: that &s;upreme judica|tory ordered him to be rebuked at the bar. Conceiving
<PB N="76" REF="79">that the truths of God he had in his &s;ermon &s;upported, were hereby injured, he prote&s;ted that he could not, without violating his con&s;cience, &s;ubmit to this &s;en|tence. Me&s;&s;. William Wil&s;on, Alexander Moncrief, and James Fi&s;her, for the exoneration of their con|&s;ciences, prote&s;ted again&s;t the prevailing cour&s;e of defection. Without allowing the&s;e four brethren to attempt a defence of their conduct, the a&s;&s;embly ap|pointed their commi&s;&s;ion to proceed again&s;t them by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and higher cen&s;ure, if they &s;hould not re|tract their prote&s;t, and profe&s;s their &s;orrow for taking it. When the commi&s;&s;ion met in Augu&s;t, the pro|te&s;ting brethren were hardly allowed to declare their mind; and becau&s;e they continued adhering to their prote&s;t, they were &s;u&s;pended from the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try. The next meeting of the commi&s;&s;ion, in No|vember, by their Moderator's ca&s;ting vote, &s;u&s;pended them al&s;o from their mini&s;tration in their re&s;pective congregations. Hereupon the&s;e brethren declared a &s;ece&s;&s;ion, not from the con&s;titution of the Scots church, but from the prevailing party in her judica|tories; and, that they might regularly adhere to their principles, and afford relief to tho&s;e people that were oppre&s;&s;ed with intru&s;ion of pa&s;tors, they con&s;tituted them&s;elves into an eccle&s;ia&s;tic court, which they called the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery. Their minutes &s;hew, that, quickly after their erection, Me&s;&s;. Wil&s;on and Mon|crief drew up a paper, intitled, "A te&s;timony to the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government of the church of Scotland" This paper was judicially con|&s;idered and approved in their meetings at Colfargy and Dunfermline, and in it they exhibit their rea&s;ons of &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion from the prevailing party in the judicatories of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, viz. 1. That that party were breaking down the Pre&s;byterian con&s;titution of church|government, by their trampling upon and making deci&s;ions quite contrary to the barrier acts and rules which had been enacted by the Scots church in her
<PB N="77" REF="80">pure&s;t times, for a&s;certaining due deliberation in the framing of &s;tanding laws and general rules; by their exerci&s;ing a lordly tyranny over men's con&s;ciences, in impowering heritors and elders to impo&s;e upon Chri&s;|tians what &s;piritual guides they plea&s;ed; by their pro|moting violent intru&s;ion of mini&s;ters as opportunity permitted; by their cen&s;uring and ejecting mini&s;ters from their congregations, merely for prote&s;ting again&s;t a &s;inful act of a&s;&s;embly; by threatening the highe&s;t cen|&s;ures to &s;uch as &s;hould admini&s;ter bapti&s;m or the Lord's &s;upper to tho&s;e who could not in con&s;cience &s;ubmit to the mini&s;try of intruders, and allowing the commi&s;&s;ion to take the Pre&s;bytery's power in &s;ettlement of mini&s;ters, if the&s;e Pre&s;byteries refu&s;ed to promote the violent im|po&s;ition of mini&s;ters upon reclaiming congregations. 2. That they were pur&s;uing &s;uch methods as tended to corrupt the doctrine contained in their confe&s;&s;ion of faith, in &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on's proce&s;s, and refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;ert the truth, in oppo&s;ition to his various errors: in care&s;&s;ing Mr. Campbell, Profe&s;&s;or of Church Hi&s;tory at St. Andrew's, notwith&s;tanding his ridiculing practical goodne&s;s as enthu&s;ia&s;m, and his declaring that &s;elf-love is the chief motive and &s;tandard of all virtuous and religious actions; that the being of God and immortality of the &s;oul cannot be known by the mere light of nature; and yet the laws of na|ture are a certain and &s;ufficient rule to direct rational minds to happine&s;s, and our ob&s;erving them the great means of our real and la&s;ting felicity: and finally, in their permitting or encouraging preachers to entertain their hearers with dry harangues of almo&s;t mere Heathen morality, in&s;tead of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. 3. That they were impo&s;ing upon mini&s;ters, as a term of com|munion, the &s;inful breaking of their ordination-vows, by neglecting all proper oppo&s;ition to the prevailing cour&s;e of apo&s;tacy from the doctrine, wor&s;hip, govern|ment and di&s;cipline of the Scots church. 4. That they
<PB N="78" REF="81">were continuing ob&s;tinate in their evil ways, notwith|&s;tanding of all ordinary means u&s;ed to recal them.</P>
<P>Moreover, in this te&s;timony, the&s;e four brethren de|clared their adherence to their ordination-vows, and to the &s;tandards of the mother church; and that they intended to hold eccle&s;ia&s;tic communion with all &s;uch of her mini&s;ters and members as oppo&s;ed the above|mentioned cour&s;e of back&s;liding, as they &s;hould have opportunity.</P>
<P>The &s;trict party of the Scots church having vigo|rou&s;ly exerted them&s;elves in the choice of members, the a&s;&s;embly of 1734 was very different from &s;everal of the preceding: &s;undry corrupt cour&s;es were checked; the &s;eceding brethren were appointed to be reponed to their charges; but as the act of a&s;&s;embly repre&s;ented this as done without condemning the act of a&s;&s;embly of 1733, or the conduct of their commi&s;&s;ion, the&s;e bre|thren reckoned the truths that &s;uffered along with them not duly vindicated, and therefore declined joining the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories on that footing, and publi&s;hed the rea&s;ons of their conduct: however, they waited about two years and a half, looking and wi&s;hing for an opportunity of returning to the judicatories, during which time they kept their meetings of Pre&s;bytery for almo&s;t nothing but prayer and conference: at length, ob&s;erving the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories fa&s;t returning to, or proceeding in their fore-mentioned corruptions, in|tru&s;ions promoted, Profe&s;&s;or Campbell di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out cen&s;ure, and his error concerning &s;elf-love inad|vertently approved by the general a&s;&s;embly: her own excellent act again&s;t violent &s;ettlements, and another for orthodox preaching, generally di&s;regarded, they began to preach to tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians who peti|tioned for it, and appointed Mr. Wil&s;on, one of their number, to train up &s;tudents for the holy mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Mean while, in the beginning of 1737, Me&s;&s;. Ralph Er&s;kine and Thomas Mair joined them, declaring, that they joined them not as different from, but as a
<PB N="79" REF="82">part of the church of Scotland, witne&s;&s;ing again&s;t the corruption of the prevailing party in her e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories; that they intended no withdrawment from &s;uch godly mini&s;ters as were groaning under and wre&s;t|ling again&s;t the then cour&s;e of back&s;liding; and that they propo&s;ed to return to the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories whenever they &s;hould return to their duty.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery publi&s;h|ed a &s;econd te&s;timony, calculated not to enumerate the cau&s;es of Sece&s;&s;ion, but to repre&s;ent the grounds of the Lord's anger again&s;t the generation; to approve former reformations, to condemn the &s;teps of defection from it, and the mo&s;t prevalent errors of the times, and a&s;|&s;ert the truth in oppo&s;ition thereto. In this paper they particularly rehear&s;ed and condemned the principal de|fections of church and &s;tate between 1650 and 1737: they expre&s;sly condemned the errors of Me&s;&s;. Sim&s;on and Campbell, and &s;hewed them to be contrary to the word of God, and to the We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith and catechi&s;ms: they &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted, that the Old and New Te&s;tament are not only a &s;ufficient and principal, but the ONLY rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy God: that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;upreme, only true, and nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent God, of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance with his eternal Father: that God from eternity decreed all things merely according to the coun&s;el of his will, and elected his people to everla&s;ting life, without any regard to their good works as the motive or con|dition of his choice: that God entered into a covenant of works with Adam as the repre&s;entative of all his na|tural &s;eed: that, in con&s;equence of the breach of this covenant, all men are conceived and born in &s;in, are by nature children of wrath, and can do nothing &s;piritually good: that tho' there be no nece&s;&s;ary connexion between natural &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and our obtaining of &s;aving grace; yet it is the duty of all unregenerate per&s;ons &s;eriou&s;ly to attend go&s;pel ordinances, whether public, private or &s;ecret, as the means whereby God conveys his con|verting
<PB N="80" REF="83">influence: that the light of nature is not &s;uffi|cient to guide fallen men to true or la&s;ting happine&s;s: that Chri&s;t a&s;&s;umed our nature, is very God and very man in two di&s;tinct natures, and one per&s;on for ever: that he, as our &s;urety, undertook for all the elect, and gave to the law and ju&s;tice of God whatever obedience and &s;atisfaction they could require of us: that his righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us; is the ONLY foundation of our pardon, acceptance with God, and title to eter|nal life, and not any thing wrought in or done by us: that want of conformity to God's law, in heart or life, is truly and properly &s;in: that &s;inning and &s;uffering will be the mi&s;ery of the damned in hell thro' eternity: that all believers in Chri&s;t are fully delivered from the moral law as a covenant of works, &s;o as to be thereby neither ju&s;tified nor condemned, but are for ever under it as a binding rule of obedience given by Jehovah the Creator and Redeemer of men: that God needs no|thing from, nor can be profited by any creature, and therefore rewards their good actions entirely of his own free will and ab&s;olutely gracious bounty: that not &s;elf-intere&s;t or plea&s;ure, but the holy law of God, is the &s;upreme and only &s;tandard of all religious and virtu|ous actions: that not &s;elf-love, but a view of the glo|rious excellencies of God, as revealed in Chri&s;t, and a regard to his authority, is the leading motive of our love and obedience to him: that no believer can ever totally fall from a &s;tate of grace, nor did Chri&s;t's di&s;|ciples, while he lay in the grave, look upon him as a downright impo&s;tor: that Chri&s;t <HI>alone</HI> is King and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of his church; to him <HI>alone</HI> it belongs to give her laws, ordinances, and officers; to him <HI>alone</HI> her offi|cers are &s;ubject in their &s;piritual admini&s;trations: that he hath warranted them to hold general a&s;&s;emblies, and other church judicatories, as often as nece&s;&s;ary: that he hath appointed the Pre&s;byterian form of go|vernment, and no other, to continue in his church till the end of time: that Chri&s;t having in his word pre|&s;cribed
<PB N="81" REF="84">a government in his church, di&s;tinct from, and not &s;ubordinate to the civil magi&s;trate, he hath in|tru&s;ted it not to all church-members, but only to her office-bearers, who&s;e power is entirely &s;ubordinate to the laws declared in his word: that the&s;e officers ought to be &s;et over congregations by the call and con&s;ent of the majority of &s;uch therein as are admitted to full communion with the church in all her &s;ealing ordi|nances, no per&s;on's vote being preferred upon any &s;e|cular account. Along with the&s;e a&s;&s;ertory declarations of their belief, they condemned and profe&s;&s;ed their de|te&s;tation of the contrary errors; and finally declared their hearty adherence to the We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith, catechi&s;ms, directory for wor&s;hip, and form of church-government, and to the national covenant of Scotland, as explained to abjure Prelacy and the arti|cles of Perth, and to the &s;olemn league and covenant of the three kingdoms, and to all acts of a&s;&s;em|bly, or other te&s;timonies, tending to promote or &s;up|port their ance&s;tors covenanted work of reformation; and particularly to their own repre&s;entations to the commi&s;&s;ion of the general a&s;&s;embly in 1733, their fir&s;t te&s;timony, and their rea&s;ons of not acceding to the judicatories of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>Though this te&s;timony was not intended for a new &s;tandard, but as an open appearance in favour of tho&s;e that had been long acknowledged by the nation; yet per&s;ons at their acce&s;&s;ion to, or joining with the Sece|ding mini&s;ters, did commonly profe&s;s their approba|tion of it, as far as they under&s;tood it: but that the pre&s;bytery did not tyrannically require &s;uch as joined them to believe the certainty of the various narratives of fact contained therein, is fully evident; Mr. Wil|&s;on, the principal defender of the Seceding cau&s;e, boldly avers, that Mr. Currie his antagoni&s;t, in charging it with twenty-four mi&s;takes re&s;pecting hi&s;torical facts, did not affect its proper &s;ub&s;tance, but merely wran|gled about circum&s;tances; and that the plain meaning
<PB N="82" REF="85">of acceders approving this te&s;timony, was their &s;igni|fying their conjunction with the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery, in the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion of the truths of God held forth from his word in our received &s;tandards of doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government.</P>
<P>Now nothing can be more certain, that neither the word of God, nor &s;tandards of the Scots church, but acts of parliament, acts of a&s;&s;embly, and other like fallible vouchers, hold forth the hi&s;torical a&s;&s;ertions of that paper.</P>
<P>Not long had this te&s;timony been publi&s;hed, when multitudes of private Chri&s;tians, a good number of elders, and two more mini&s;ters, being offended with the growth of apo&s;tacy above-mentioned, and anew grieved with a great part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, for publickly rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing on the Sabbath, and thus &s;olemnly acquie&s;cing in an act relative to the murderers of Cap|tain Porteous, in which the parliament claimed a &s;piri|tual head&s;hip over the church, con&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uting them&s;elves judges of mini&s;ters fitne&s;s to &s;it in her courts, and threatening eccle&s;ia&s;tic penalties for di&s;obedience to their civil authority, did join the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery upon the footing of it. Now many from different corners of the land petitioned this pre&s;bytery for &s;er|mons; their reque&s;ts were deliberately granted: the Seceding mini&s;ters preached, and e&s;pecially held fa&s;ts, in mo&s;t corners of the &s;outh part of the country.</P>
<P>The plainne&s;s of this &s;econd te&s;timony, and the crowding of the common people after the authors of it, mightily provoked the managers in the e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories: the Seceding mini&s;ters were libelled, and cited before the a&s;&s;embly of 1739. When they ap|peared, the a&s;&s;embly declared their willingne&s;s to drop the libel, overlook every thing foregoing, and receive them with open arms into all manner of church-fel|low&s;hip: but the&s;e a&s;&s;ociate brethren, con&s;idering that the a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of intruders, and others deeply guilty of the growing defection, declined her
<PB N="83" REF="86">authority, as a not rightly con&s;tituted court of Chri&s;t. This daring attack, added to the former provocation, mightily chagrined the managers; wherefore the a&s;&s;em|bly, in 1740, without pretending to find the&s;e mini&s;ters guilty of error in doctrine, or immorality in practice, depo&s;ed them from being mini&s;ters of the church of Scotland. This &s;entence occa&s;ioned a mighty run of the common people after the Seceding brethren; but as their followers increa&s;ed, &s;o did their trials. Sundry, if not mo&s;t of the&s;e mini&s;ters, had ere now believed, that a magi&s;trate has only power to appoint fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings, with the diets and cau&s;es thereof, in extraordinary ca&s;es, and where he has not acce&s;s to con&s;ult with a church that he judges rightly con&s;ti|tuted: but &s;ome of their people, who had acceded to them, <HI>now</HI> prompted them to determine, Whether it was lawful for them to ob&s;erve a fa&s;t on the day ap|pointed by the King for that effect? In a <HI>pro re nata</HI> meeting of pre&s;bytery, de&s;igned for other bu&s;ine&s;s, and while 14 out of 22 members were <HI>ab&s;ent,</HI> this que&s;tion was irregularly hawled in by Me&s;&s;. Alexander Moncrief, Thomas Nairn, and Thomas Mair; and becau&s;e they judged the e&s;tabli&s;hed church had practically given up their power of appointing fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings into the hand of the Sovereign, they carried it by, I think, one vote, that the Seceders ob&s;erving fa&s;ts on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, was a &s;inful connivance at the King's exerci&s;ing a &s;piritual head&s;hip over the church. The deep &s;ilence, concerning this matter, in their after confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, prefixed to their covenant-bond, indeed plainly demon|&s;trates, that this deci&s;ion was never generally approved by the Seceding clergy: but their people being once, many of them, tinctured with the above notion, they &s;eldom found it for edification to ob&s;erve fa&s;ts or thank&s;givings on the days appointed for that end by the civil magi&s;trate: neverthele&s;s, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, they u&s;ed to recommend private fa&s;ting, or to forbear giving offence with public labour; &s;o that except a few
<PB N="84" REF="87">forward and le&s;s judicious per&s;ons, it may be ju&s;tly averred, that the Seceders gave as little open offence to the government on that head as mo&s;t in the nation, who pretended to be zealous ob&s;ervers of the Sove|reign's fa&s;ts.</P>
<P>By Mr. Whitfield's mi&s;&s;ives to Mr Ralph Er&s;kine, and other like circum&s;tances, &s;everal of the Seceding brethren had conceived a very favourable opinion of him; but finding, upon conver&s;e with him, that he decried all particular forms of church government as a mere human device, and being exceedingly offended with his printed enthu&s;ia&s;tic account of God's dealing with his &s;oul, they turned their favour into warm op|po&s;ition. In 1742, and &s;ome following years, a &s;ur|pri&s;ing commotion in the &s;ouls and bodies of men, while they attended &s;ermon, happened at Cambu&s;lang, near Gla&s;gow, and other places: this Mr. Whitfield's admirers extolled as a wonderful work of the Spirit of God; but the Seceders, tho' they could not deny that the lives of many were, for the pre&s;ent, thereby re|formed, and that &s;ome divine influence might attend the truths there delivered; yet, becau&s;e of the bodily con|vul&s;ions, di&s;orderly noi&s;e, imaginary views of Chri&s;t, aver&s;ion at a covenanted work of reformation, nau&s;eous boa&s;ting, and other irregularities attending it, they decried it as in a great mea&s;ure delu&s;ive. In the warm contention upon &s;o critical a topic, no doubt both parties &s;ometimes run into extremes, and became &s;tumbling blocks to one another: however, the return of multitudes of the &s;ubjects of the &s;urpri&s;ing influence to their wonted cour&s;es, mightily confirmed the Sece|ders in their &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Mean while the Seceding body had another trial from among them&s;elves: it was their earne&s;t de&s;ire and prayer to God, to make our Sovereign King George, and every &s;ubordinate magi&s;trate, zealous friends to a covenanted work of reformation; but they were firmly per&s;uaded, that difference in religion deprives
<PB N="85" REF="88">no civil ruler of his ju&s;t power and authority; they openly te&s;tified again&s;t Mr. M'Milian's party, and others that thought otherwi&s;e: not a few of them bore arms again&s;t the Pretender; not one of them can be charged with appearing on his &s;ide: their mini&s;ters often debarred from the Lord's table &s;uch as denied the lawful authority of our pre&s;ent government, in all things civil; and they formally excommunicated &s;ome few of their followers that pre&s;umed to do &s;o.</P>
<P>In 1742, Mr. Thomas Nairn, a per&s;on too volatile for a witne&s;&s;ing mini&s;ter, took it into his head to main|tain, that none but a Pre&s;byterian and covenanted per|&s;on could be rightful Sovereign of this realm: his a&s;|&s;ociated brethren quickly oppo&s;ed him with great vigour; proceeded to cen&s;ure him; publi&s;hed a judi|cial declaration, wherein they &s;hewed, from the word of God, our &s;tandards and covenants, that it is the duty of the whole nation to obey the pre&s;ent civil go|vernment, in all things lawful, for con&s;cience &s;ake</P>
<P>After about &s;even years deliberation, the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery agreed upon the form of a bond of public covenanting with God; and, in December 1743, them&s;elves began to enter into it. Next year their act on this head was publi&s;hed, together with another, vindicating the doctrine of God's free grace from the injury done it by the general a&s;&s;emblies of 1720 and 1722 above-mentioned. The form of the Seceders co|venant had been &s;hort, and mo&s;tly plain, had it not reduplicated upon a long confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, that it is to be feared few of their people could fully know the import and certainty of: not a few, therefore, con|demned the pre&s;bytery's act, declaring, that the &s;wear|ing of this bond &s;hould be the term of mini&s;terial and Chri&s;tian communion with them. It was thought very unrea&s;onable, that a per&s;on of an eminently holy life, and zealou&s;ly attached to all the truths of God, to the Scots &s;tandards and covenants, &s;hould be excluded from the &s;eals of God's covenant, merely becau&s;e he could
<PB N="86" REF="89">not under&s;tand the meaning or certainty of &s;ome things in this bond, and the acknowledgment of &s;ins prefixed to it; or would not &s;wear to what he under&s;tood not. Many of the Seceding clergy were afterwards &s;en&s;ible that this act was &s;inful; nor do I know that ever the mo&s;t zealous acted up to the tenor of it, with re&s;pect to their people.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1745, the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery was &s;o far increa&s;ed, that they divided them&s;elves into three pre&s;byteries, under one &s;ynod. Soon after which, the Lord, to puni&s;h their manage|ment of his cau&s;e, gave them up to angry contentions, and an unprecedented breach. Tho' in many of their public papers they had &s;olemnly declared their adherence to the ordination-vows u&s;ed, and con&s;equently to the religion profe&s;&s;ed in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; tho' in their principles concerning magi&s;tracy, publi&s;hed in the year 1743, p. 50, they had judicially declared their thank|fulne&s;s to God that their own religion had &s;uch &s;ecu|rity by the pre&s;ent civil government, as no nation on earth enjoyed the like: yet at the very fir&s;t meeting of their A&s;&s;ociate Synod, they began warmly to debate, <HI>whether it was lawful for Seceders to &s;wear that clau&s;e in &s;ome Scots burge&s;s-oaths,</HI> viz. <HI>I profe&s;s and allow with my heart the true religion pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed within this realm, and authori&s;ed by the laws thereof; I &s;hall abide at and defend the &s;ame to my life's end, renouncing the Roman re|ligion called Papi&s;try.</HI> Me&s;&s;. Ebenezer and Ralph Er|&s;kines, James Fi&s;her, and others, maintained, that &s;ince it was the true, the divine religion it&s;elf, profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled in Scotland, and not the human and faulty man|ner of profe&s;&s;ing or &s;ettling it, that was &s;worn to in the&s;e oaths: that &s;ince, in their &s;ece&s;&s;ion, they had ne|ver pretended to &s;et up a new religion, but to cleave more clo&s;ely to that whereinto they had been bapti&s;ed: that &s;ince in their te&s;timonies they had e&s;pou&s;ed the very &s;ame &s;tandards with the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, had frequently and &s;olemnly declared their adherence to the
<PB N="87" REF="90">ordination-vows, &s;undry of them had taken therein, and whereby they were engaged to the religion, doc|trine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and government profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled in the land: that &s;ince, tho' in their public pa|pers they had quarrelled with the manner in which the true religion is pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled in the realm, and te&s;tified again&s;t the various corruptions of church and &s;tate; yet they had been &s;o far from quar|relling with the true religion profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled, that no more than two years before they had judicially de|clared the religion &s;ecured by the pre&s;ent civil govern|ment to be their own; and therefore could not, <HI>with|out the mo&s;t glaring &s;elf contradiction,</HI> prohibit the &s;wear|ing of the above clau&s;e, as in it&s;elf &s;inful, for tho&s;e of their way. Me&s;&s;. Alexander M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncrief, Thomas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, comended, that Seceders &s;wearing of this clau&s;e was exceeding &s;inful, and a giv|ing up the whole of their te&s;timony; becau&s;e, &s;aid they, &s;wearing to the true religion pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed and authori&s;ed in this realm, imports a &s;wearing to it as pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled, and &s;o an approving by oath of all the corrupt acts of church and &s;tate. After much hot contention, tho&s;e who defended the burge&s;s-oath, and who now began to be called Burgh|ers, offered, for the &s;ake of peace, to agree to an act forbidding Seceders to &s;wear the &s;aid clau&s;e, as inex|pedient in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. This peaceful pro|po&s;al the Antiburghers refu&s;ed, as altogether in&s;uffi|cient; and, in a pretty thin meeting of &s;yned, Apr. 9, 1746, pu&s;hed and carried a vote, condemning the pre|&s;ent &s;wearing of the above religious clau&s;e by Seceders, as &s;inful, and incon&s;i&s;tent with their te&s;timony and bond for renewing the covenants. Part of the Burgher mini&s;ters and elders prote&s;ted again&s;t this &s;entence; but the Antiburghers an&s;wers to their rea&s;ons of prote&s;t, not being ready, as they ought, again&s;t next meeting of &s;ynod, and &s;ome of the more zealous having in the mean time publickly debarred the defenders of the bur|ge&s;s-oath
<PB N="88" REF="91">from the Lord's table, a new que&s;tion was introduced, Whether the above &s;entence relative to the religious clau&s;e of &s;ome burge&s;s-oaths &s;hould be a term of mini&s;terial and Chri&s;tian communion? After much warm altercation at two meetings, and a di&s;&s;ent and prote&s;tation of the Antiburghers again&s;t putting this que&s;tion, it was voted, and carried, that the &s;aid &s;entence &s;hould not be a term of mini&s;terial or Chri&s;tian com|munion, at lea&s;t till the affair &s;hould be deliberately con&s;idered in pre&s;byteries and &s;e&s;&s;ions, their mind ob|tained, and further means u&s;ed, by prayer and confe|rence, for &s;eeing eye to eye in the truth. No &s;ooner was this &s;entence carried, than Mr. Thomas Mair, a zealous Antiburgher, declared and prote&s;ted, that thereby his oppo&s;ers had forfeited all &s;ynodical power, and that the lawful authority of the A&s;&s;ociate Synod was devolved upon a con&s;tituted meeting of his party, and of &s;uch as &s;hould cleave to them; all whom he called to meet next day in Mr. Gib's hou&s;e for that effect; and then, with twenty-two others, and with|out either moderator or clerk, withdrew from thirty-two or thirty-three of their brethren, con&s;tituted in Chri&s;t's name, and with their moderator and clerk attending them. The day following, the Burghers a&s;&s;embled and con&s;tituted &s;ynod in the ordinary place: but the Anti|burghers con&s;tituted them&s;elves into another &s;ynod in Mr. Gib's hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;erted them&s;elves &s;ole judges of their own an&s;wers, di&s;&s;ents and prote&s;ts; enacted, that the Burgher mini&s;ters had forfeited all power per|taining to their office; and that no Seceding pre&s;bytery or &s;e&s;&s;ion, not con&s;tituted in &s;ubordination to their pre|&s;ent meeting, could be a lawful court of Chri&s;t. This act was the ba&s;is of their next meetings of pre&s;bytery; hence the Antiburghers of the pre&s;bytery of Edin|burgh de&s;erted their appointed place of next meeting, and took another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e of the pre&s;bytery of Perth re|fu&s;ed their brethren a &s;eat with them, and they univer|&s;ally refu&s;ed to &s;it in &s;e&s;&s;ion with tho&s;e elders that would
<PB N="89" REF="92">not &s;ubmit to their above con&s;titution of &s;ynod. Mourn|ful was the &s;tumbling and alienation of affection that en&s;ued among the people; multitudes were perplexed how to &s;ide them&s;elves; and no doubt many did it en|tirely by gue&s;s. To remedy this awful confu&s;ion, the Burgher clergy wrote twice to their brethren that de|&s;erted them, earne&s;tly begging a meeting for prayer and conference, in order to their uniting in the Lord's cau&s;e. The Antiburghers, whether from unwilling|ne&s;s to convince the Burghers of the &s;ins they laid to their charge, or from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they had not &s;ufficient arguments for that end, or from &s;ome diffe|rent view; returned no other an&s;wer, than that they could not, con&s;i&s;tently with their te&s;timony, comply with any &s;uch propo&s;al; and that their brethren's only way for peace was to pre&s;ent them&s;elves penitent pan|nels at their bar. The Burghers could not in con&s;cience &s;ubmit to their brethren's con&s;titution of &s;ynod. None of them therefore appeared at their bar, except Mr. Hutton, who did it for no other purpo&s;e than to read a formidable attack upon the con&s;titution of their court, which to this moment has received no proper refutation. The Burghers continued exerci&s;ing their mini&s;try, and holding their judicatories as formerly: they even made an act, declaring the Antiburgher con|&s;titution in Mr. Gib's hou&s;e void and null, ever&s;ive of pre&s;bytery, and contrary to &s;cripture and rea&s;on: For the&s;e, and other above-mentioned in&s;tances of oppo&s;i|tion, the Antiburghers depo&s;ed, excommunicated, and delivered them over to Satan. The&s;e &s;entences had no effect: the Me&s;&s;. Er&s;kines, and other Burghers, lived as holily, preached as edifyingly, and died as com|fortably, as any of their oppo&s;ers. The Antiburghers having proceeded two years in thus cen&s;uring their brethren, were obliged to confe&s;s, that all along them|&s;elves had been lying under &s;candal with re&s;pect to partaking with their brethren in their &s;in; and, at a meeting of &s;ynod, purged one another from it by ju|dicial

However, this was &s;carce well fini&s;hed, when M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Patrick Mathew, an Antiburgher, de&s;erted to the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rghers, and was cen&s;ured as they had been.&mdash;Not long after Mr. Tho|mas Mair, the founder of the con&s;titution in Mr. Gib's hou&s;e, for maintaining that Chri&s;t in &s;ome &s;en&s;e died for all mankind, was pro&s;ecuted, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d cen&s;ured by his brethren as guilty of Arminian error. Nothing tran&s;|acted &s;ince, on either &s;ide, de&s;erves a place in a general hi&s;tory of religion: it remains briefly to repre&s;ent the pre&s;ent agreement and difference of the two parties. Since their rupture in 1747, both have retained their re&s;pective &s;ynod, pre&s;byteries and &s;e&s;&s;ions: both have &s;upplied the male<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ontents in their oppo&s;ers congrega|tions with preaching: the congregations belonging to both amount to about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in &s;undry whereof are &s;ome thou&s;and examinable per&s;ons; but the greater part much below that number. Which party have the greate&s;t number of followers, I know not; but the Antiburghers having the teacher of philo&s;ophy and profe&s;&s;or of divinity on their &s;ide at the breach, then carried off almo&s;t all the &s;tudents, and to this day have the greate&s;t number of mini&s;ters; tho' even here the Burghers &s;eem to gain ground.

Both, I hope, preach the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in purity, and en|deavour to commit the mini&s;try to faithful men. I heir form of wor&s;hip is much the &s;ame with that of their mother-church: with both, mini&s;ters endeavour pub|lickly to catechi&s;e, and privately to vi&s;it, their congre|gations once a-year, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons; both dete&s;t and avoid private b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pti&s;m; both u&s;e to admini|&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper in their congregation once a-year,

With re&s;pect to difference, none can be admitted to the &s;acraments by the Antiburghers, except he at lea&s;t in|directly declare his per&s;ua&s;ion that it is very &s;inful for Seceders to &s;wear the above-mentioned clau&s;e of &s;ome burge&s;s-oaths: they contend, that the con&s;titution of the Scots revolution church is Era&s;tian, and could ne|ver be lawfully joined with: they aver that their reli|gion is different from that of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, but have not hitherto declared what divine truth they hold that is not comprehended in her public &s;tandards: they &s;eem to equal, if not &s;ometimes prefer, the &s;econd te&s;timony above-mentioned, to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and other &s;tandards of their mother church, and mean|while renounce the ordination-vows, together with &s;uch parts of the fir&s;t te&s;timony and repre&s;entations adhered to in it, as approve of the religion at pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ed in the realm.

<P>Scotland is divided into &s;ixty-nine pre&s;byteries, each con&s;i&s;ting of from twelve to twenty-four contiguous pari&s;hes: the mini&s;ters of the&s;e pari&s;hes, with one ruling elder, cho&s;en half-yearly at every kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion, compo&s;e a pre&s;bytery.

<PB N="95" REF="98">a year, at the principal town of its bounds. They chu&s;e a Moderator, who is their Prolocutor. The acts of the &s;ynods are &s;ubject to the review of the general a&s;&s;embly, which is the la&s;t re&s;ort of the kirk of Scotland.</P>
<P>The general a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ts of commi&s;&s;ioners from pre&s;byteries, royal burghs, and univer&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies.

<P>The general a&s;&s;embly meets once a year, in the month of May, and is opened and adjourned by the King's Royal Commi&s;&s;ioner, appointed for that pur|po&s;e
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But, agreeable to their old maxims, the general a&s;&s;embly own no &s;piritual head&s;hip in the civil power, and in 1746 they met be|fore the High Commi&s;&s;ioner's commi&s;&s;ion came down, and directly proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, after chu&s;ing a Moderator.</NOTE>, who, however has no vote.</P>
<P>Upon the day appointed for the meeting of the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, the preceding Moderator makes a &s;er|mon before the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner and the mem|bers. After &s;ermon they go to the a&s;&s;embly hou&s;e, where the Commi&s;&s;ioner being upon the throne, they proceed to chu&s;e a Moderator. The election is thus managed: The la&s;t Moderator nominates two or three mini&s;ters, to whom the a&s;&s;embly adds whom they &s;ee fit; the <HI>nominees</HI> are &s;aid to be upon the li&s;t. Every man upon the li&s;t gives his vote and withdraws&punc; then the a&s;&s;embly votes, and he that has the majority is cho&s;en, and takes the chair at the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the throne.</P>
<P>The Moderator being cho&s;en, the High Commi&s;|&s;ioner produces his commi&s;&s;ion, impowering him to &s;it there, with his Maje&s;ty's letter to the a&s;&s;embly; both
<PB N="96" REF="99">which are read by the clerk, all the members &s;tand|ing. The Commi&s;&s;ioner then makes a &s;peech, which is an&s;wered by the Moderator, and then committees are appointed. Next day is &s;et apart for prayers, the Commi&s;&s;ioner certainly attending. The Moderator no|minates eight or nine to pray &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; after which the a&s;&s;embly adjourns.</P>
<P>Next day they fall to bu&s;ine&s;s. The Moderator has no negative; he only &s;ums up the debates, and puts the que&s;tion. The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is always to an&s;wer the King's letter, which is done by a committee, who&s;e draught is read and examined, and altered if need be, and then finally approved by the hou&s;e. Then the Moderator &s;igns it in their pre&s;ence, and delivers it to the Commi&s;&s;ioner, who di&s;patches it to the King. Though the bu&s;ine&s;s is u&s;ually tran&s;acted by commit|tees, yet any member may propo&s;e what he plea&s;es in the a&s;&s;embly. When a motion is made, or any bu&s;i|ne&s;s is brought in by a committee, the Moderator names two or three of the mo&s;t eminent members to &s;peak to it; after whom any member may &s;peak that is &s;o inclined. When the debate is over, it is put to the vote, and carried, <HI>agreed,</HI> or <HI>di&s;agreed,</HI> by the ma|jority.</P>
<P>Matters of great weight, that bind the whole church, are fir&s;t brought in by way of overtures, and then de|bated in the hou&s;e; after which, if approved, they are tran&s;mitted to every pre&s;bytery in Scotland, who return their an&s;wers by their commi&s;&s;ioners to the next a&s;&s;embly, who, according as they find them approved by the pre&s;byteries, pa&s;s them into acts of a&s;&s;embly, or reject them.</P>
<P>During every a&s;&s;embly, a diet is appointed to in&s;pect the acts of the provincial &s;ynods, as they had before in&s;pected the proceedings of the pre&s;byteries. Before they ri&s;e, they nominate a &s;tanding commi&s;&s;ion of mi|ni&s;ters and ruling elders, cho&s;en out of every &s;ynod, to attend the affairs of the church, till the next a&s;&s;embly
<PB N="97" REF="100">meets. Of the&s;e twenty-one is a <HI>quorum,</HI> of whom fif|teen mu&s;t be mini&s;ters. The Moderator of the a&s;&s;em|bly moderates in the commi&s;&s;ion, if pre&s;ent. They were obliged to &s;it the fir&s;t week in every quarter, all parliament-time, before the union, and as often el&s;e as they thought fit. They have the power of the a&s;&s;em|bly in all matters referred to them from it: regularly they can act in nothing but what is recommended from the a&s;&s;embly; but then that recommendation often in|cludes a general clau&s;e, impowering them to act in every thing that may be for the good of the church. They are accountable to the next general a&s;&s;embly, and therefore keep a regi&s;ter of their proceedings.</P>
<P>When the a&s;&s;embly are to ri&s;e, the Moderator tells them that it is time to di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, and appoint another a&s;&s;embly in the name of their ma&s;ter, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: then he &s;peaks to the Commi&s;&s;ioner, in the name of the a&s;&s;embly, who returns an an&s;wer, and then di&s;&s;olves them in the King's name, and fixes the time and place for the new a&s;&s;embly, which is always to be within a year and a day after the di&s;&s;olution of the old one. The Moderator then prays, and the a&s;&s;embly &s;ing a p&s;alm; after which the Moderator ble&s;&s;es them, and they &s;eparate.</P>
<P>The deacon, who&s;e office is for life, is cho&s;en by the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion in every pari&s;h, approved by the con|gregation, and &s;olemnly &s;et apart by the mini&s;ter, af|ter a &s;ermon and prayer for the occa&s;ion. He collects the offerings for the poor, inquires into their nece&s;&s;i|ties, and di&s;tributes to them as the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion ap|points; he a&s;&s;i&s;ts at the communion, and attends the mini&s;ters and elders in their vi&s;itations and examina|tions. He has no vote in the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions, but may give his opinion, if a&s;ked; nor has he any &s;tipend from the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The ruling elders are cho&s;en out of the pari&s;h by the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion, and ordained before the congrega|tion, after &s;ermon and prayer; their office is al&s;o for
<PB N="98" REF="101">life, in ca&s;e of no mi&s;demeanor. They a&s;&s;i&s;t the mi|ni&s;ters in over&s;eeing and correcting the manners of the people, attend them in vi&s;iting and catechi&s;ing their di&s;tricts in the pari&s;hes, in praying with the &s;ick, in private admonitions, and at the communion-table. In all matters of government and di&s;cipline they have an equal vote with the mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, or preaching pre&s;byters, only can preach and admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, catechi&s;e, pronounce church-cen&s;ures, ordain deacons and ruling elders, a&s;&s;i&s;t at the impo&s;ition of hands upon other mini&s;ters, and moderate, or pre&s;ide, in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatories. Severe &s;crutinies are made into their qualifications, re|&s;pecting life and manners; they mu&s;t be competently &s;killed in the &s;criptures, the learned languages, and all &s;orts of divinity. They are always <HI>tried</HI> by the pre&s;by|tery, before they are licen&s;ed to preach, in order to have <HI>calls</HI> to be mini&s;ters of any pari&s;h. Indeed, in Scotland, all their mini&s;ters have an univer&s;ity-educa|tion, and at lea&s;t have commenced Ma&s;ter of Arts. They are not ordained till they have obtained a <HI>call</HI> to a particular flock, and when that is obtained, they can|not de&s;ert it, without the authority of a pre&s;bytery, or &s;ome &s;uperior judicatory. To be guilty of non-re&s;i|dence merits deprivation. If the call is agreed to by the congregation, the mini&s;ter pre&s;ent atte&s;ts it by his &s;ub&s;cription, in their pre&s;ence, and then reports it to the pre&s;bytery, who acquaint the per&s;on concerned, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. If on trial he &s;atisfies the pre&s;bytery, they then i&s;&s;ue out an edict, that all who can object any thing again&s;t this <HI>nominee,</HI> &s;hould appear before the pre&s;bytery, there to make good their allegations. If the objections are of weight, or even doubtful, the or|dination is &s;u&s;pended, till a more perfect trial, other|wi&s;e they proceed to ordination. On the ordination-day, a fa&s;t is &s;trictly kept to implore God's ble&s;&s;ing upon the work they are about; the Moderator preaches upon the nature and dignity of the mini&s;terial office, the per|&s;on
<PB N="99" REF="102">to be ordained is examined of his faith and a&s;&s;ent to the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the kirk, the motive of his coming into the mini&s;try, and whether by any indirect means he has obtained his pre&s;entation or call, of his re&s;olution to do his duty faithfully, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If he an&s;wers to the Moderator's &s;atisfaction, the pari&s;hioners ratify their choice by lifting up their hands. The Moderator and mini&s;ters pre&s;ent, then lay their hands upon his head, and &s;o ordain him mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and pa&s;tor of that congregation. The ordina|tion being over, the elders, heritors, and chief pari&s;h|ioners, take their mini&s;ter by the hand. If the <HI>nominee</HI> had been ordained before, he is only recommended to the people, with a &s;uitable &s;ermon and prayers, by the Moderator, and the people take him by the hand. The patron, for at pre&s;ent every pari&s;h has a patron, is bound to nominate, or pre&s;ent, in &s;ix months after a vacancy, otherwi&s;e the pre&s;bytery fills the place, <HI>jure devoluto;</HI> but that privilege does not hold in royal burghs. Patronages were re&s;tored by 10 Anne.</P>

<P>Such as are found guilty of a&s;&s;aulting the lives of mini&s;ters, or robbing their hou&s;es, or actually attempt|ing the &s;ame, &s;hall be puni&s;hed by death, and e&s;cheat of moveables. Five hundred merks is allowed to the di&s;coverer, and three hundred merks to the apprehender of the criminals, to be paid out of the King's trea&s;ury. For their better accommodation, they are provided with convenient par&s;onage hou&s;es (man&s;es), and where they are not fitting, the heritors of the pari&s;h &s;hall build complete ones for them, not exceeding 1000 l. nor under 500 merks value.</P>
<P>The kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion can judge in matters of le&s;&s;er &s;can|dal; they can &s;u&s;pend from the Lord's &s;upper for a time: their con&s;ent in the call of a mini&s;ter and pre|centor
<PB N="100" REF="103">(pari&s;h-clerk) is nece&s;&s;ary. They provide all nece&s;&s;aries for the communion, regulate all particulars relative to public wor&s;hip, and give notice of all ca|techi&s;ings and parochial vi&s;itations. They have a trea|&s;urer, who is cho&s;en out of the deacons, to keep and di&s;tribute the poor's money: they keep two regi&s;ters, one of births and marriages, the other of their own proceedings, which they mu&s;t lay before the pre&s;by|tery. Appeals lie from them, in all ca&s;es, to their own pre&s;bytery, whom they mu&s;t not contradict.</P>
<P>Pre&s;byteries have no juri&s;diction beyond their own bounds. They determine all appeals from kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions; but can try nothing at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which is cog|nizable before a kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion. They compo&s;e all diffe|rences between mini&s;ters and people, for which they hold pre&s;byterial vi&s;itations in every pari&s;h, where they examine the regi&s;ters of kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions, and cen&s;ure or commend as they find cau&s;e. They inquire into re|pairs of churches, and &s;ee that glebes and man&s;es &s;uf|fer no dilapidation. They appoint &s;chools, and &s;ee that the funds &s;ettled by act of parliament for that purpo&s;e be not mi&s;employed; and the &s;choolma&s;ters are &s;ubject to their cen&s;ure and examination. They only can inflict the greater excommunication, i. e. ab|&s;olute prohibition of the communion. They licence probationers, interpo&s;e in all calls and ordinations of mini&s;ters, &s;u&s;pend and depo&s;e them, and, in fine, de|termine eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters of all kinds within their bounds; but &s;o as not to contradict any act of parlia|ment. There lies an appeal, in all ca&s;es, from the pre&s;byteries to the provincial &s;ynods. Before they in|flict private cen&s;ures, they ob&s;erve a fa&s;t. In the&s;e private cen&s;ures every mini&s;ter withdraws by turns, and the Moderator inquires of the re&s;t concerning his conduct, and, according to the report, they are called in, and commended or cen&s;ured.

<P>Before every communion, the mini&s;ter vi&s;its and ex|amines every family in his pari&s;h, once at lea&s;t; of which vi&s;its notice is given the preceding Lord's day, that every di&s;trict may know when he intends to vi&s;it them. To live &s;ix weeks in a pari&s;h makes a man a pari&s;hioner; after which, if he leaves it, he mu&s;t get a certificate of his good behaviour, &s;igned by the mi|ni&s;ter or kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion clerk, in the name, and with con|&s;ent, of the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the new comer only re|moves from another family in the pari&s;h, his name is transferred in the regi&s;ter (or examination-book) to its proper place. The mini&s;ter, on his vi&s;it, marks and enters the children in his examination-book, if they are of a fit age. He then exhorts every one to a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of their re&s;pective duties, and particularly to family-prayer, reading the &s;criptures, and &s;inging of p&s;alms. To omit family-prayer is e&s;teemed very &s;candalous; and the omi&s;&s;ion is often puni&s;hed by ex|communication. At parting, the mini&s;ter u&s;ually prays with every family. Vi&s;itation being over, the mini&s;ter gives notice when he will examine the per&s;ons marked in his book. Every di&s;trict comes to church by them&s;elves, at the time appointed; and the mini&s;ter, accompanied by the elder and deacon of that di&s;trict, examines them, in order as they &s;tand in the examina|tion-book. He examines them out of the <HI>&s;horter Catechi&s;m;</HI> and if the per&s;on an&s;wers, he catechi&s;es up|on tho&s;e que&s;tions, and in&s;tructs them in what is dif|ficult.

<P>Bapti&s;m, in the church of Scotland, is admini&s;tered by none but the mini&s;ter, who does it by &s;prinkling; and whether it is performed at church or at home, there is always a &s;ermon before it. The father, or, in his ab&s;ence, &s;ome reputable neighbour, pre&s;ents the infant to the mini&s;ter, who a&s;ks the parent, if he de&s;ires the child &s;hall be received into the vi&s;ible church, and re|ceive the &s;igns and &s;eals of the covenant of grace, by bapti&s;m?

<P>Some time before the Lord's &s;upper is admini&s;tered, the congregation is to have notice thereof from the pulpit. The week before, the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion meets, and draws up a li&s;t of all the communicants in the pari&s;h, according to the mini&s;ter's examination-book, and the re&s;timony of the elders and deacons. According to this li&s;t, tickets are delivered to each communicant, if de&s;ired, and the mini&s;ters and elders al&s;o give tickets to &s;trangers who bring &s;ufficient te&s;timonials. None are allowed to communicate without &s;uch tickets, which are produced at the table. Tho&s;e who never received are in&s;tructed by the mini&s;ter, &s;everally, and by them|&s;elves, in the nature of the &s;acraments, and taught
<PB N="103" REF="106">what is the proper preparation thereunto. The com|munion is always celebrated upon the Lord's day. The Wedne&s;day or Thur&s;day before there is a &s;olemn fa&s;t, and on the Saturday there are two preparatory &s;ermons. On Sunday morning, after &s;inging and prayer as u&s;ual, the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h preaches a &s;uitable &s;ermon; and, when the ordinary wor&s;hip is ended, he, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, forbids the unworthy to approach, and invites the penitent to come and receive the &s;acrament. Then he goes into the body of the church, where one or two tables, accord|ing to its width, are placed, reaching from one end to the other, covered with a white linen cloth, and &s;eats on both &s;ides, for the communicants. The mi|ni&s;ter places him&s;elf at the end or middle of the table, on which the elements are placed. After a &s;hort di&s;|cour&s;e, he reads the in&s;titution, and ble&s;&s;es the elements; then he breaks the bread, and di&s;tributes it and the wine to tho&s;e that are next him, who tran&s;mit them to their neighbours; the elders and deacons attending to &s;erve, and to &s;ee that the whole is performed with decency and order. Whil&s;t the&s;e communicate, the mini&s;ter di&s;cour&s;es concerning the nature of the &s;acra|ment. When the fir&s;t company has received, they withdraw, and others take their places; and whil&s;t this is performing, a p&s;alm is &s;ung, and &s;o they continue till all have communicated. The mini&s;ter then returns to the pulpit, and di&s;cour&s;es concerning the particular ca&s;es of communicants; and, with thank&s;giving and &s;inging of p&s;alms, the morning &s;ervice is concluded. Then the congregation is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for an hour, and &s;o meet again, when they have the u&s;ual afternoon wor&s;hip; and on Monday, about nine o'clock in the morning, there is public wor&s;hip and two &s;ermons, which clo&s;e the whole.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the pari&s;h-mini&s;ter is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two or three of his neighbours, and &s;eldom preaches
<PB N="104" REF="107">oftener than the morning of the &s;acrament-day. No private communions are allowed in Scotland.</P>
<P>No holy-days are ob&s;erved in Scotland, be&s;ides the Lord's-day, which is ob&s;erved with great exactne&s;s. They likewi&s;e ob&s;erve fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings; in ap|pointing which, tho' they attribute a power to the church, yet they have the &s;anction of the Privy Coun|cil, as thereby they may be more &s;trictly kept.</P>
<P>Marriage is &s;olemnized by the mini&s;ter, and none can marry that are nearer than cou&s;in germans; pro|hibited degrees in blood hold al&s;o in affinity. Banns are a&s;ked, on three &s;everal Lord's days, in churches where both parties live, before marriage can be con|tracted. The mini&s;ter fir&s;t prays, then di&s;cour&s;es upon the in&s;titution, ri&s;e, and ends of matrimony, and the duties the parties owe to each other. The re&s;t of the ceremony, &s;ave the u&s;e of the ring, as well as the form of words u&s;ed, are nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e in the church of England. The whole is concluded with a prayer.</P>
<P>The di&s;cipline of the church of Scotland is regulated by two acts of a&s;&s;embly, one dated April 4, 1705, the other April 18, 1717, which declare that nothing &s;hall be accounted &s;candalous, but what is accounted &s;o by the word of God, or by &s;ome act or univer&s;al cu&s;tom of the church of Scotland agreeable thereto. If a &s;candal be not notified in five years, it &s;hall not be revived &s;o as to form a proce&s;s thereanent, unle&s;s it becomes again flagrant; but in &s;uch ca&s;es, the con|&s;ciences of the offenders ought to be dealt with in pri|vate, to bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and duty. All church-judicatories have power to convene, exa|mine, and cen&s;ure every per&s;on within their own bounds, in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es cognizable before every &s;uch judicatory. Per&s;ons living without the bounds of any judicatory, &s;hall not, for order &s;ake, be cited by them; but they &s;hall de&s;ire the judicatory, under whom &s;uch per&s;ons live, to cau&s;e him to appear before the ju|dicatory, before whom the cau&s;e is to be examined.
<PB N="105" REF="108">Mini&s;ters are not &s;ubject to their own kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ions, but to the &s;uperior judicatories of the church. In &s;can|dals, private admonition is to be fir&s;t u&s;ed. Where per&s;ons or parties are concerned, the court mu&s;t give them, fir&s;t, a legal and timely citation, &s;etting forth the cau&s;es thereof: if the per&s;on re&s;ides in the pari&s;h, forty-eight hours notice is &s;ufficient, and the officer mu&s;t certify his having properly executed the &s;ummons, by calling the party at his door. No man is to be de|clared contumacious till he has been three times cited, either per&s;onally or at his dwelling hou&s;e, if the cau&s;e be tried at the fir&s;t in&s;tance; but if it be in the ca&s;e of a reference or appeal, where the per&s;on had actually appeared already before an inferior court, a citation <HI>apud acta,</HI> to appear before his &s;uperior, is &s;ufficient if it be minuted; and if in&s;tructed, infers contumacy if not obeyed. Though in the&s;e ca&s;es a man may be pro|nounced, forthwith, contumacious, upon his non-ap|pearances, and not producing any <HI>relevant</HI> (&s;ufficient) excu&s;e; yet the court is advi&s;ed to examine and try the cau&s;e, either by witne&s;&s;es upon oath, or otherwi&s;e, before they pronounce the per&s;on cited contumacious. If the party appears, the Moderator is to acquaint him with the cau&s;e, and to give him, if de&s;ired, a note of the cau&s;e, and the witne&s;&s;es that are to be made u&s;e of. Where there is no formal complaint, there is no need of accu&s;ers or informers, but the party cited is peremp|torily to an&s;wer the que&s;tions put to him by the court: but then, if he be acquitted, the court, whether he requires it or not, &s;hould cen&s;ure the informers for ca|lumny or impudence. The defender &s;hould have a li&s;t of the names of the witne&s;&s;es, &s;ome time before, or at his appearance. The&s;e ought al&s;o to have timely notice, that they may appear and give their evidence. If they do not appear after the third &s;ummons, they may be proceeded again&s;t as contumacious, and ap|plication may be made to the civil magi&s;trate to oblige them to appear. What the party can object in his own
<PB N="106" REF="109">vindication, is to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, before the witne&s;&s;es can be judicially examined: if the court thinks his objec|tions ju&s;t, the witne&s;&s;es are to be ca&s;t. An informer may be a witne&s;s, where he does not formally com|plain for his own intere&s;t, or where there are no pre|&s;umptions of malice in the accu&s;ation. Witne&s;&s;es, even where there is no <HI>relevant</HI> objection, mu&s;t purge them&s;elves of malice, bribes, good deed done, or to be done, and partial coun&s;el. Witne&s;&s;es are to be &s;worn and examined before the Moderator and the per&s;on accu&s;ed; and, if he appears, the accu&s;ed may de&s;ire to have the witne&s;&s;es cro&s;s-examined, when they have given in all their evidence. Before the proof is made, the accu&s;ed may offer grounds of exculpation, <HI>i. e.</HI> bring witne&s;&s;es to prove his innocence, which if he in&s;i&s;ts upon, it mu&s;t be allowed. If the exculpa|tion be fully proved, <HI>e. g.</HI> if he can prove an <HI>alibi,</HI> he mu&s;t be acquitted. But there is no room for exculpa|tion, after depo&s;itions are once taken. Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe all their depo&s;itions if they can write; or, if they cannot, the Moderator mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe it for them. Depo&s;itions being taken, the parties withdraw, and the matter is calmly debated by the pre&s;bytery. Fugitives, whil&s;t proce&s;s is depending, mu&s;t fir&s;t be cited to ap|pear, from the pulpits of their re&s;pective pari&s;hes; then from the pulpit of every pari&s;h in the pre&s;bytery. If they do not at la&s;t appear, they are to be declared fugi|tives from church-di&s;cipline, and that declaration mu&s;t be intimated in all the bounds of the pre&s;bytery; and pro|ce&s;s is to be &s;topped, till notice can begot of tho&s;e per&s;ons. In ca&s;e of drunkenne&s;s, di&s;obedience to parents, Sab|bath-breaking, &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, &s;colding, fighting, lying, cheating, or &s;tealing, the per&s;ons guilty are or|dinarily admoni&s;hed in private only for the fir&s;t offence; for the &s;econd offence, rebuked by the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and, on promi&s;e of amendment, there they are to &s;top.

<P>In ordinary ca&s;es the le&s;&s;er excommunication only is in&s;licted, which is done after much deliberation and tenderne&s;s to the criminal, and with great &s;olemnity; the people are exhorted not to hold unnece&s;&s;ary-com|munion with him. The greater excommunication the church only inflicts upon the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate offenders. It is the expul&s;ion of the offender from the communion of the faithful, a debarring him from all the privileges of church-member&s;hip, and, in the words of the apo&s;tle, <HI>a delivery of him over to Satan.</HI> However, ex|communication di&s;&s;olves no civil or natural rights, nor does it exempt from the duties belonging to them.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">If when all this is done, it be found ineffectual for the purpo&s;es intended, the civil magi&s;trate &s;hould be de&s;ired to u&s;e his coercive power to &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch offences, and to vindicate the di&s;cipline of the church from contempt.</P>
<P>The end of church-cen&s;ure being the repentance of the &s;inner, if he &s;hews real &s;igns of godly &s;orrow, and if, upon application to the pre&s;bytery fir&s;t made, they give a warrant for his ab&s;olution, he is to be brought before the congregation, and there confe&s;s his &s;in, and expre&s;s his &s;orrow for it. This is to be repeated as often as the pre&s;bytery and kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall judge con|venient. When the congregation is thus &s;atisfied of his repentance, the mini&s;ter is, in a prayer with the congregation, to de&s;ire our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has in&s;tituted the ordinance of excommunication, <HI>i. e.</HI> of binding and loo&s;ing the &s;ins of men upon earth, with a promi&s;e of ratifying above, the rightful &s;en|tence that &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed here below, to accept of this man's repentance, to forgive his former di&s;obedience, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his &s;pirit, that he may never a|gain relap&s;e into the like offences. And then, prayer being ended, he pronounces the &s;entence of ab&s;olution, by which he wholly takes off the former &s;entence, and receives him into the communion of the church, and the free u&s;e of all the ordinances of Chri&s;t. Sentence being pa&s;&s;ed, the mini&s;ter exhorts him, as a brother, to per&s;everance in his godly re&s;olution; the elders embrace him, and the congregation, thence forward, communicate with him as a member of their own body; and wherever the &s;entence of excommunication hath been publi&s;hed, the &s;entence of ab&s;olution is al&s;o expre&s;sly intimated.</P>

<P>At burials of the dead the church of Scotland u&s;es neither funeral &s;ermons or any public prayers; they are performed without any ceremony of words, only the bodies are decently attended to the graves, by all that plea&s;e to go; of which they have notice (at Edin|bugh particularly) by ringing of a hand-bell thro' the &s;treet, by the cryer, who &s;ays, "All brethren and &s;i&s;ters, I let you to wot that there is a brother&mdash; or &s;i&s;ter&mdash;departed at the plea&s;ure of Almighty God, &amp;c." and then gives notice when he or &s;he is to be interred. When the corp&s;e is &s;ilently laid in the grave, the funeral rites are ended, and every one re|tires to their &s;everal habitations.</P>
<P>For the advancement of religion in Scotland, the &s;ociety for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge, was erected by letters-patent from Queen Anne, "granting them full power to receive &s;ub&s;criptions, mortifica|tions, donations, legacies, &s;ums of money, lands, goods and gear, and therewith to erect and maintain &s;chools to teach to read, e&s;pecially the holy &s;criptures, and other good and pious books; and al&s;o to teach writing and arithmetic, and &s;uch like degrees of knowledge, in the highlands, i&s;lands, and remote corners of Scotland," appointing their meetings, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e letters|patent bear date May 25, 1709, which year the general a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed an act to encourage the de&s;ign of erecting charity-&s;chools. Both the&s;e in&s;titutions have met with de&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s: in every pari&s;h there is a charity-&s;chool, who&s;e ma&s;ter has a &s;alary from the public, and the &s;cholars allow them &s;ome &s;mall matter quarterly. In country-&s;chools they teach writing, arith|metic,
<PB N="110" REF="113">and reading Engli&s;h, and in &s;ome Latin. In the royal burghs they teach Latin and Greek, and have tolerable &s;alaries; be&s;ides that each &s;cholar gives 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. a quarter; and in the&s;e &s;chools they teach nothing el&s;e, having Engli&s;h and writing &s;chools be&s;ides, in all places where they have grammar &s;chools. In country-pari&s;hes, the &s;choolma&s;ter is u&s;ually pre|centor and kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion clerk, which brings him in &s;ome advantage; for he receives 1 s. and &s;ometimes 1 s. and 8 d. for a&s;king banns of marriage; 8 d. for regi&s;tering a child that is chri&s;tened; and 3d. for a certificate for any per&s;on that removes out of the pari&s;h. The &s;choolma&s;ters are obliged to take the oath of allegiance, to &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to a trial from the pre&s;bytery of the bounds.</P>
<P>For a continual &s;upply of mini&s;ters in the church of Scotland, it was ordained by the general a&s;&s;embly, in 1645, that a number of pious youths, of good ex|pectations and approved ability, &s;hould be cho&s;en and &s;ent <HI>bur&s;ars</HI> or <HI>exhibitioners,</HI> to the univer&s;ities, by the &s;everal pre&s;byteries of Scotland.

The bur&s;ar not to continue at the univer&s;ity above four years, and when any are removed by death, or called to a particular charge, others are to &s;ucceed in their room. All bur&s;ars of theology are obliged to bring &s;ufficient te&s;timonies from the univer&s;ities, where they are bred, of their proficiency and good behaviour, and be al&s;o ready to give proof of their labours, at the &s;everal &s;ynods, if it &s;hall be required: and if they are found deficient, their exhibitions are taken away, and given to others.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="114">Be&s;ides bur&s;ars from the pre&s;byteries, there are others maintained by noblemen and gentlemen, mini&s;ters and others, who have left great &s;ums of money for that end; the intere&s;t whereof is applied to maintain poor &s;tudents: and by a gift of King William III. divers &s;tudents have con&s;iderable allowances to &s;tudy beyond &s;eas; which gift is charged upon the revenues of the late Bi&s;hops.</P>

<P>THIS denomination of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters have been called by different names at different pe|riods of time. In their fir&s;t attempts for a further refor|mation of the church, they were, by way of reproach, termed Puritans, a name derived from the <HI>Cathari</HI> or <HI>Puritani</HI> of the third century after Chri&s;t. The ungenerous and cruel per&s;ecutions they &s;uffered for con&s;cience &s;ake, in the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. will ever reflect di&s;grace upon the memory of tho&s;e Princes.</P>
<P>I might &s;ay that Wickliffe, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h re|former, maintained many of tho&s;e points, by which the Puritans were afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed, or trace them from the reign of Edward VI. when many ex|cellent
<PB N="115" REF="118">divines were endeavouring a further reforma|tion from the ceremonies and fopperies of the church of Rome, particularly with regard to the Popi&s;h ve&s;t|ments. But I &s;hall ob&s;erve that the reformed exiles, who were driven to Franckfort, to avoid the cruelties of Mary I. (and who being outed from thence by tho&s;e reformers, who &s;tickled for King Edward's liturgy in 1556, which the others &s;crupled the u&s;e of) and who afterwards &s;et up congregations at Ba&s;il and Geneva, and there followed the Geneva di&s;cipline, were fir&s;t called <HI>Puritans,</HI> as their opponents obtained the name of <HI>Conformi&s;ts.</HI> The hi&s;tory of the church of England, foregoing, has particularly recited their various &s;uffer|ings, for their oppo&s;ition to the habits

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;tory of the Puritans, vol. i. p. 235.</NOTE> they complained of the Bi&s;hops affecting to be thought a &s;uperior order to Pre&s;byters, and claiming the &s;ole right of ordination, and the u&s;e of the keys. They di&s;liked the temporal dignities and lord&s;hips an|nexed to their offices, and their engaging in &s;ecular employments, and tru&s;ts, &amp;c. as tending to exalt them too much above their brethren, and not &s;o agreeable to their characters, as mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, nor con|&s;i&s;tent with the due di&s;charge of their &s;piritual func|tion.&mdash;They excepted to the titles and offices of Arch|deacons, Deans, Chapters, and other officials belonging to cathedrals, as having no foundation in &s;cripture, or primitive antiquity, but intrenching upon the privileges of the pre&s;byters of the &s;everal dioce&s;es. They com|plained of the exorbitant power and juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hops and their Chancellors in their &s;piritual courts, as derived from the canon law of the Pope, and not
<PB N="116" REF="119">from the word of God, or the &s;tatute law of the land: of their fining, impri&s;oning, depriving, and putting men to exce&s;&s;ive charges for &s;mall offences; and that the highe&s;t cen&s;ures, &s;uch as excommunication and ab|&s;olution, were in the hands of laymen, and not in the &s;piritual officers of the church.&mdash;They lamented the want of a godly di&s;cipline, and were unea&s;y at the promi&s;cuous and general acce&s;s of all per&s;ons to the Lord's table. The church being de&s;cribed in her ar|ticles as a <HI>congregation of faithful per&s;ons,</HI> they thought it nece&s;&s;ary that a power &s;hould be lodged &s;omewhere, to inquire into the qualifications of &s;uch as de&s;ired to be of her communion.&mdash;Though they did not di&s;pute the lawfulne&s;s of &s;et forms of prayer, provided a due liberty was allowed for prayers of their own com|po&s;ure, before and after &s;ermon; yet they di&s;liked &s;ome things in the public liturgy, e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; as the frequent repetition of the Lord's prayer, the re|&s;pon&s;es, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the offices of marriage, burial, &amp;c. &s;uch as, <HI>with my body I thee wor&s;hip; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ure and certain hope of the re&s;urrection to eternal life,</HI> to be pronounced over the wor&s;t of men, if not excom|municated, &amp;c.&mdash;They di&s;liked the reading of the apo|cryphal books in the churches, whil&s;t &s;ome parts of the canonical books were omitted; <HI>dumb</HI> mini&s;ters, plura|li&s;ts, and non-re&s;idents, and that pre&s;entations to bene|fices were in the hands of the Queen, Bi&s;hops, or &s;ome <HI>lay patron,</HI> which ought to ari&s;e from the election of the people.&mdash;They di&s;approved of the approbation of &s;undry of the church fe&s;tivals, or holidays, as having no foundation in &s;cripture, or primitive antiquity; &s;uch as &s;aints days, fa&s;ting on Friday, &amp;c. in Lent, &amp;c.&mdash; They di&s;allowed of the cathedral mode of wor&s;hip; of &s;inging their prayers, and of the <HI>Antiphone,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chanting of the p&s;alms, by turns, trumpets, organs, &amp;c. which were not in u&s;e in the church, for above 1200 years after Chri&s;t.&mdash;They &s;crupled confor|mity to certain rites and ceremonies, which were in|joined
<PB N="117" REF="120">by the rubrick, or the Queen's injunctions; viz. To the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m; bapti&s;m by mid|wives; the manner of churching women; the u&s;e of god|fathers and godmothers, to the exclu&s;ion of the parents from being &s;ureties for the education of their own child|ren, &amp;c. &amp;c. the cu&s;tom of confirming children, as &s;oon as they could repeat the Lord's prayer and catechi&s;m, by which they had a right to come to the &s;acrament without any other qualification; this might be done by children of five or &s;ix years old; kneeling at the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper; bowing to the name of Je&s;us; the ring in marriage; to the wearing of the &s;urplice and other ve&s;tments to be u&s;ed in divine &s;ervice. There was no difference in points of doctrine; &s;o that one article more, and my readers have the chief heads of controver&s;y between the church of England and the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters at this time, viz. "The natural right that every man has to judge for him&s;elf, and make profe&s;&s;ion of that religion he apprehends mo&s;t agreeable to truth, as far as it does not affect the peace and &s;afety of the government he lives under, without being de|termined by the prejudices of education, the laws of the civil magi&s;trate, or the decrees of councils, churches or &s;ynods."</P>
<P>In the maintenance of their con&s;cientious &s;epara|tion, they &s;eemed in&s;pired with all the courage and fortitude of the primitive confe&s;&s;ors and martyrs; in point of argument they had much the better of their adver&s;aries; but had no protection again&s;t the pains, penalties, impri&s;onments and fines impo&s;ed by the governing powers; under which however they in general behaved with Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s and unex|ampled patience.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Pre&s;byterian church in England was erected at Wand&s;worth, a village near London, and, on the 20th of November 1572, eleven elders were cho&s;en, and their offices de&s;cribed, in a regi&s;ter, in|titled <HI>the order of Wand&s;worth.</HI> Other churches, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="118" REF="121">proclamations for uniformity, &amp;c. were &s;oon erected in other counties, though with the utmo&s;t pri|vacy and &s;ecre&s;y. Under James the Fir&s;t's per&s;ecution, numbers of Puritan mini&s;ters and others left the king|dom, and retired to Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, Leyden, Utrecht, &amp;c. &amp;c. and erected churches in tho&s;e places after the Pre&s;byterian model; tho&s;e churches were maintained by the &s;tates, according to treaty with Queen Elizabeth, as the French and Dutch churches were in England.</P>
<P>The Puritans were far from finding any relaxation, of the &s;everities exerci&s;ed again&s;t them, in the reign of the unfortunate Charles I. who following the violent advice of Archbi&s;hop Laud, reduced them to the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting the kingdom in &s;till greater numbers, by his e&s;pou&s;ing Arminiani&s;m, and oppo&s;ing the old Calvini&s;tical doctrines. Arminiani&s;m and Popery may be &s;aid to have been prevalent in his court; but were warmly oppo&s;ed by the Calvini&s;ts. Laud introduced Popi&s;h ornaments into the churches, turned the communion-tables into altars, puni&s;hing tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed him with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, and with a total di&s;regard to the laws of the land. The oppo&s;ers to the&s;e and other innovations were &s;tiled <HI>doc|trinal Puritans,</HI> and the patroni&s;ers <HI>doctrinal Papi&s;ts.</HI> Indeed it &s;eemed to be Laud's favourite &s;cheme to bring about a union of the churches of England and Rome, to which he &s;acrificed the intere&s;ts of the king|dom, of his ma&s;ter, and finally his own life. By his own arbitrary will he made many alterations in the book of Common Prayer, by which he rendered it &s;till more exceptionable to the Puritans; numbers of worthy clergymen were deprived, and &s;uffered the ut|mo&s;t rigours for not reading and inforcing the decla|ration for the allowance of revels, may-games, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the Sabbath-day; and, in &s;hort, the Puritan divines and others, on the&s;e accounts, underwent as cruel a per&s;ecution as could be carried on by an inqui|&s;ition.
<PB N="119" REF="122">If &s;ome of the&s;e con&s;cientious people were too &s;trict and preci&s;e in their oppo&s;ition, they could not be much blamed, as there &s;eemed &s;uch a vi&s;ible de&s;ign to defeat the ble&s;&s;ed effects of the reformation, by coun|tenancing and adopting all the ceremonies and fopperies of the Romi&s;h church. The&s;e per&s;ecutions occa&s;ioned the &s;ettlement of the colonies of New England, where many learned and pious mini&s;ters, eminent merchants, and &s;ome thou&s;ands of families, tran&s;ported them&s;elves to avoid the rage of their enemies. <HI>Heylin</HI> ob&s;erves, "the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ing of the ceremonies made the people in many trading towns tremble at a vi&s;itation; but when they found their &s;triving in vain, and that they had lo&s;t the comfort of their lecturers

The King by Laud's procure|ment laid them under &s;uch difficulties that they were &s;oon &s;ilenced, &s;uch as, that the afternoon-&s;ervice be turned into catechi&s;ing; that every lecturer read divine &s;ervice, before lecture, in his &s;urplice and hood; that they preach in gowns, and not in cloaks; that no lectu|rer be admitted that is not ready and willing to take upon him a living, with a cure of &s;ouls, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P><PB N="120" REF="125">The body of the Puritans were, however, not now Pre&s;byterians; in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. they were for the mo&s;t part of that opinion, though even then there were many Epi&s;copalians among them; but from the time that Arminiani&s;m prevailed in the church, and the whole body of Calvini&s;ts were to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Doctrinal Puritans,</HI> both parties &s;eemed to unite in a moderate Epi&s;copacy; for there was little or no mention of the old book of di&s;|cipline, for twenty years before the beginning of the civil war, all the controver&s;y being upon points of Cal|vini&s;m; upon a reduction of the exorbitant power of the Bi&s;hops, and upon innovations (as they were called) and ceremonies; there were few, either among the clergy or laity, that had a zeal for Pre&s;bytery, or de&s;ired any more than to be rid of their oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Many of the ceremonies and innovations complain|ed of by the Puritans were removed, by the long par|liament, in 1641, and lectures again e&s;tabli&s;hed. They voted away the hierarchy of the church of England; but &s;till, at the beginning of the civil war, no other di&s;cipline was erected in its room; nor, as Mr. Neale ob&s;erves, was the name, &s;tile, and dignity of Arch|bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops taken away by ordinance of parli|ament, till September 5, 1646, <HI>i. e.</HI> till the war was over, and the King their pri&s;oner. In this interval there was properly no e&s;tabli&s;hed form of church-go|vernment, the clergy being permitted to read more or le&s;s of the liturgy as they plea&s;ed, and to govern their pari&s;hes according to their di&s;cretion. The ve&s;tments were left indifferent, &s;ome wearing them, and others, in imitation of the foreign Prote&s;tants, making u&s;e of a cloak. In the place of that profanene&s;s and con|tempt of religion vi&s;ible before the civil war, all orders of men in the city, army, and country, became devout and pious. "The generality of tho&s;e people

Among tho&s;e were &s;ome of the elder clergy, who were pre|ferred before the ri&s;e of Archbi&s;hop Laud; all the de|prived and &s;ilenced mini&s;ters, with the whole body of lecturers and warm popular preachers, both in town and country; the&s;e drew after them great numbers of the more &s;erious and devout people, who were not ca|pable of judging between the King and parliament, but followed their &s;piritual guides, from a veneration they had for their integrity and piety." No wonder with &s;uch in&s;truments the parliament did &s;uch great things; for even the &s;ober men who were again&s;t the parliament, u&s;ed to &s;ay, "The King had the better cau&s;e, but the parliament had the better men."</P>
<P>On June 12, 1643, both hou&s;es of parliament joint|ly publi&s;hed an ordinance for the calling an a&s;&s;embly of divines, for &s;ettling the government and liturgy of the church of England, to meet July 1, in Henry VII.'s chapel in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey, hence called the We&s;t|min&s;ter a&s;&s;embly. This famous a&s;&s;embly drew up the well known confe&s;&s;ion of faith, a larger and &s;horter catechi&s;m, and a form of church-government after the Pre&s;byterian mode, being principally urged thereto by the low &s;tate of the parliament, and the indi&s;pen&s;ible ne|ce&s;&s;ity there was for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to join with them (as ob&s;erved p. 60, before going) they admitted of the &s;olemn
<PB N="122" REF="127">league and covenant. Our commi&s;&s;ioners, as Burnet ob&s;erves, pre&s;&s;ed for a civil league, but the Scots would have a religious one; to which the Engli&s;h were obliged to yield, but took care, at the &s;ame time, to leave a door open for the latitude of interpretation. "The Engli&s;h in foreign parts were not exempted from this te&s;t. December 20, 1643, it was ordered by the Lords and Commons, that no per&s;on &s;hould be ca|pable of being elected a common council-man of the city of London, or &s;o much as have a voice in &s;uch elections, who has not taken the covenant. January 29, 1644, it was ordered by the Commons, that the &s;olemn league and covenant be, upon every day of fa&s;ting and public humiliation, publickly read in eve|ry church and congregation within the kingdom; and every congregation is obliged to have <HI>one,</HI> fairly print|ed in a large letter, in a table fitted to be hung up in a public place of the church or congregation, to be read by the people. All young mini&s;ters were required to take the covenant at their ordination; none of the laity were continued in any office of tru&s;t, civil or mili|tary, who refu&s;ed it. Thus the very per&s;ons who had oppo&s;ed te&s;ts and &s;ub&s;criptions under Epi&s;copacy, now were forward to impo&s;e them, in the &s;evere&s;t manner, upon their fellow &s;ubjects and fellow Chri&s;tians. In|deed the a&s;&s;embly, though compo&s;ed in general of men of learning and excellent divines, yet had a per&s;ecuting zeal, and hurt them&s;elves by running into heats upon the <HI>divine right</HI> of Pre&s;byterian government, which lo&s;t them, together with their enmity to toleration, the hearts and &s;upport of the parliament and their be&s;t friends. The Epi&s;copal party had no concern in the government of the church from the time of the taking the covenant to the re&s;toration, though the hierarchy was not yet &s;et a&s;ide by an ordinance of parliament. There were no more eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, no wearing the habits, no regard paid to the canons or ceremonies,
<PB N="123" REF="128">nor even to the common prayer it&s;elf. Whil&s;t the a&s;&s;embly of divines &s;at, all church-bu&s;ine&s;s went thro' their hands; the pari&s;hes cho&s;e their mini&s;ters, the a&s;&s;embly examined and approved, and the parliament confirmed them in their benefices, without any regard to the Archbi&s;hop or his Vicar. In the di&s;tant counties the mini&s;ters were put in by the parliament Generals, as appears by an ordinance of February 27, 1643, giving authority to Lord Fairfax to &s;upply the churches in the North, the preamble to which recites, that "the hou&s;es being credibly informed that many mi|ni&s;ters, in the county of York, were not only of a &s;candalous life, but having left their churches and cures, had withdrawn them&s;elves wilfully from the &s;ame, and joined &s;uch forces as had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the parliament, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with men, money, hor&s;es and arms; therefore it is ordained, that Lord Fairfax be authori&s;ed to fill up their places with &s;uch learned and godly divines as he &s;hall think fit, with advice of the a&s;&s;embly." In 1644 the univer&s;ities were purged, and many of the officers deprived, with above 200 graduates and &s;cholars, who&s;e places were &s;upplied by the a&s;&s;embly of divines, principally with Calvini&s;t mi|ni&s;ters, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the livings from which the hier|archical clergy were ejected, were al&s;o &s;upplied by Pre&s;byterian divines; &s;o that pre&s;bytery was now the reigning religion; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the Pre&s;by|terians were as determined again&s;t toleration as ever the church of England had lately been. But it mu&s;t be &s;aid they brought religion to be the reigning fa&s;hion, the Lord's day was &s;trictly ob&s;erved, all profanene&s;s and immorality were di&s;couraged, and the care and pains of the new governors of the church was abundantly vi&s;ible in the lives and behaviour of all ranks of peo|ple throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>After many and long debates in the We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly and the parliament, on the divine right of
<PB N="124" REF="129">pre&s;bytery, the power of the keys, &amp;c. the Pre&s;|byterian form of church-government became the national e&s;tabli&s;hment, in 1645, by way of <HI>proba|tion,</HI> as far as an ordinance of parliament could make it; for the preamble &s;ets forth, "That if upon trial it was not found acceptable, it &s;hould be rever&s;ed or amended: that the two hou&s;es found it very diffi|cult to make the new &s;ettlement agree with the laws and government of the kingdom: that therefore it could not be expected that a pre&s;ent rule, in every particular, &s;hould be &s;ettled at once; but that there will be need of &s;upplements and additions, and per|haps alterations, as experience &s;hall bring to light the nece&s;&s;ity thereof."&mdash;"The parliament apprehended
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neale's Puritans, vol. iii. p. 295.</NOTE> they had now e&s;tabli&s;hed the fundamentals of the Pre&s;|byterian di&s;cipline, tho' it proved not to the &s;atisfac|tion of any one party of Chri&s;tians; &s;o hard it is to make a good &s;ettlement when men dig up old founda|tions all at once. The Pre&s;byterian government was as narrow as the prelatical; and as it did not allow a liberty of con&s;cience, but claimed a civil, as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, over men's per&s;ons and proper|ties, was equally, if not more, in&s;ufferable."&mdash;"The &s;ettling pre&s;bytery
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Kennet.</NOTE> was &s;upported by the fear and love of the Scots army; and when the&s;e were gone home, it was better managed by the Engli&s;h army, who were for Independency, and a better principle of toleration; but as things &s;tood, no-body was plea&s;ed; the Epi&s;copalians and Independants were excluded; and becau&s;e the parliament would not give the &s;everal pre&s;byteries an ab&s;olute power over their communi|cants, but re&s;erved the la&s;t appeal to them&s;elves, nei|ther the Scots nor Engli&s;h Pre&s;byterians would accept of the ordinance."</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly petitioned the hou&s;es of parliament, a&s;&s;erting the divine right of the Pre&s;byterian govern|ment,
<PB N="125" REF="130">and complaining of a clau&s;e in the late ordi|nance, which e&s;tabli&s;hed an appeal from the cen&s;ures of the church to a committee of parliament. Here|upon they voted the a&s;&s;embly guilty of a <HI>praemunire;</HI> and whereas they in&s;i&s;ted &s;o peremptorily on the <HI>jus divinum</HI> of the Pre&s;byterian government, the commit|tee of parliament drew up certain queries, which they &s;ent to the a&s;&s;embly by three of their members, and de&s;ired they would re&s;olve to their &s;atisfaction. The three members al&s;o &s;et before them their ra&s;h and im|prudent conduct, and &s;hewed wherein they had ex|ceeded their province, which was "to advi&s;e the hou&s;es in &s;uch points as they &s;hould lay before them, but not to dictate to tho&s;e to whom they owed their being an a&s;&s;embly." The a&s;&s;embly, terrified at what they heard, appointed a &s;olemn fa&s;t; and the next year, 1646, the Independants having left them, and the Era&s;tians dividing them in the committee appointed to con&s;ider the que&s;tions, and entering their di&s;&s;ent, when the an&s;wer was laid before them, it was not called the an&s;wer of the committee, but of &s;ome brethren of the committee; and when the que&s;tion was put, the Era&s;ti|ans withdrew from the a&s;&s;embly, and left the high Pre&s;|byterians to them&s;elves, who agreed with but one di&s;|&s;enting voice, that "Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as King of the church, hath him&s;elf appointed a church-government di&s;tinct from the civil magi&s;trate." After more &s;quab|blings with the parliament, the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters complied to put the Pre&s;byterial government in prac|tice, according to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, with a re|&s;erve of certain <HI>con&s;iderations and cautions,</HI> which they drew up.</P>
<P>Hereupon the kingdom, in&s;tead of &s;o many dioce&s;es, was divided into a certain number of provinces, made up of repre&s;entatives from the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es within their boundaries. Every pari&s;h had a congregational or parochial pre&s;bytery for the affairs of the pari&s;h;
<PB N="126" REF="131">the parochial pre&s;byteries were combined into cla&s;&s;es: the&s;e cho&s;e repre&s;entatives for the provincial a&s;&s;emblies, as the provincial did for the national. "Thus the Pre&s;byterian church-government began to ri&s;e and ap|pear in its proper form; but new ob&s;tructions being rai&s;ed by the mini&s;ters to the choice of repre&s;entatives, the provincial a&s;&s;embly of London did not meet till the year 1647, nor did it ever obtain but in London and Lanca&s;hire. The parliament never came heartily into it; however, the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters had their vo|luntary a&s;&s;ociations for church-affairs in mo&s;t counties, tho' without any authoritative juri&s;diction."</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been ob&s;erved, that the Pre&s;byterians had refu&s;ed to come to a toleration of their brethren the Independants, in 1645, after much altercation and many papers had pa&s;&s;ed relative thereto, in a <HI>committee of accommodation,</HI> as it was &s;tiled, con&s;i&s;ting of a com|mittee of Lords and Commons appointed to treat with the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners and the committee of divines, to endeavour a union, if po&s;&s;ible, or to find out "how far tender con&s;ciences, who cannot in all things &s;ubmit to the &s;ame rule, may be borne with, according to the word of God, and con&s;i&s;tent with the public peace. "Little did the Pre&s;byterian divines think, &s;ays Neale, that in le&s;s than twenty years all their artillery would be turned again&s;t them&s;elves; that they &s;hould be ex|cluded the e&s;tabli&s;hment by an act of prelatical unifor|mity; that they &s;hould be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of pleading for that indulgence, which they now denied their brethren; and think it their duty to gather churches for &s;eparate wor&s;hip, out of others which they allowed to be true ones. If the leading Pre&s;byterians in the a&s;&s;embly and city had come to a temper with the Independants, on the foot of a limited toleration, they had, in all likelihood, prevented the di&s;putes between the army and parliament, which were the ruin of both; they might then have &s;aved the con&s;titution, and made
<PB N="127" REF="132">their own terms with the King, who was now their pri&s;oner; but they were enchanted with the beauties of covenant uniformity, and the <HI>divine right</HI> of their pre&s;|bytery, which after all the parliament would not ad|mit in its full extent."</P>
<P>From the year 1647 to the death of Charles I. matters with regard to the Pre&s;byterians continued much upon the &s;ame footing; yet tho' they filled mo&s;t of the livings, and had the city and great part of the parliament at their devotion, they met with many mortifications from the Independants and army, who were mo&s;tly of that &s;ect; but principally for their rigid and intolerant &s;pirit, which di&s;gu&s;ted all the other &s;ects: they had done all they could while the army was marched again&s;t the Scots, in 1648, to bring about a peace with the King; but the unhappy Prince ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed to comply with their terms, nor would the Pre&s;byterians relax in them, &s;o that the army had an opportunity given them to break all their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, after carefully con&s;ulting every ac|count <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> that the Pre&s;byterians are cleared from any &s;hare in the guilt of putting the King to death; nay, the London mini&s;ters publi&s;hed <HI>a &s;erious and faithful repre&s;entation,</HI> again&s;t doing any violence to the per&s;on of the King, addre&s;&s;ed to the general and his council of officers, Jan. 18, 1648. To wipe away the calumnies thrown out again&s;t them on that account, they publi&s;hed a paper al&s;o, intitled, <HI>a vindication of the London mini&s;ters from the unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon their former actings for the par|liament, as if they had promoted the bringing the King to capital puni&s;hment.</HI> In this vindication, after de|claring over again their di&s;like of the proceedings again&s;t the King, they conclude in words to this effect: "Therefore, according to our covenant, we do, in the name of the great God, warn and exhort all that belong to our re&s;pective charges, or to whom we have admini&s;tered the &s;aid covenant, to abide by their vow, and not to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be per&s;uaded

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The de&s;ign of this paper was to change the government into a kind of a commonwealth, without a King and hou&s;e of Lords. It was tendered to the nation by the officers of the army. It provided among&s;t other matters for a toleration.</NOTE> <HI>agreement of the people,</HI> which is &s;ubver&s;ive of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, and makes way for the toleration of all here&s;ies and bla&s;phemies, and will effectually divide the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. We earne&s;tly be&s;eech them to mourn for the &s;ins of the parliament and city, and for the mi&s;carriages of the King him&s;elf, in his government, which have ca&s;t him down from his excellency, into an horrid pit of mi&s;ery almo&s;t beyond example; and to pray, that God would give him effectual repentance, and to &s;anctify the bitter cup of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, which divine providence has put into his hands; and that God would re&s;train the violence of men, that they may not dare to draw upon them&s;elves and the kingdom <HI>the blood of their &s;overeign.</HI>" In &s;hort, they &s;hewed them&s;elves, in the &s;econd civil war, almo&s;t unanimous for accommodating matters with the King; but, as before ob&s;erved, the &s;tiffne&s;s of both parties rendered their de&s;igns abortive, and brought on a ca|ta&s;trophe to which they were utterly aver&s;e, and u&s;ed every means in their power to prevent.</P>
<P>That the reader may &s;ee the principles of the Pre&s;by|terians of tho&s;e days, I &s;hall fir&s;t make an extract from <HI>a te&s;timony of the truth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to our &s;olemn league and covenant; as al&s;o again&s;t the errors, here|&s;ies, and bla&s;phemies of the&s;e times, and the toleration of them; to which is added a catalogue of the &s;aid errors,</HI> &amp;c. publi&s;hed by the London clergy, and dated from Sion college, Dec. 14, 1647. It was &s;ub&s;cribed by 58 of the mo&s;t eminent pa&s;tors in London, 17 of whom were of the a&s;&s;embly of divines, to which 64 of the mini&s;ters of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, 84 of Lanca&s;hire, 83 of Devon|&s;hire, and 71 of Somer&s;et&s;hire, &s;ub&s;cribed their con|currence.
<PB N="129" REF="134">Touching errors and here&s;ies, they declare their dete&s;tation and abhorrence of the following, <HI>inter alia:</HI> "1. That the holy &s;criptures are not of divine authority, and the only rule of faith. 2. That God hath a bodily &s;hape; that God is the name of a per&s;on; and, that God is the author of &s;in, having a greater hand in it than men them&s;elves. 3. That there is not a Trinity of per&s;ons in the Godhead; that the Son is not co-equal with the Father; and, that the Holy Gho&s;t is only a mini&s;tering Spirit. 4. That God has not elected &s;ome to &s;alvation, from eternity; and re|jected or reprobated others; and, that no man &s;hall peri&s;h in hell for Adam's &s;in. 5. That Chri&s;t died for the &s;ins of all mankind; that the benefits of his death were intended for all; and that natural men may do &s;uch things as whereunto God has by way of promi&s;e annexed grace and acceptation. 6. That man hath a free-will and power in him&s;elf to repent, to be|lieve, to obey the go&s;pel, and to do every thing that God requires to &s;alvation. 7. That faith is not a &s;upernatural grace, and that faithful actions are the only things by which a man is ju&s;tified. 8. That the moral law is not the rule of life; that believers are as clean from &s;in as Chri&s;t him&s;elf; that &s;uch have no occa&s;ion to pray for pardon for &s;in; that God &s;ees no &s;in in his people, nor does he ever cha&s;ti&s;e them for it. 9. That there is no church nor &s;acraments, nor Sab|bath; the opinion of the Seekers (now called Quakers). 10. That the children of believers ought not to be baptized, nor bapti&s;m continued among&s;t Chri&s;tians; that the meaning of the third commandment is, <HI>Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf.</HI> 11. That per&s;ons of the next kindred may marry; and that indi&s;po&s;ition, unfitne&s;s, or contrariety of mind, ari&s;ing from natural cau&s;es, are a ju&s;t rea&s;on of divorce. 12. That the &s;oul of man is mortal; that it &s;leeps with the body; and that there is neither heaven or hell till the day of judgment." They al&s;o witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>error of toleration,</HI> pa|tronizing
<PB N="130" REF="135">and promoting all other errors, here&s;ies, and bla&s;phemies what&s;oever, under the gro&s;sly abu&s;ed notion of <HI>liberty of con&s;cience.</HI> Herein they complain, as a very great grievance, "that men &s;hould not have liberty to wor&s;hip God, in the way and manner as &s;hall appear to them mo&s;t agreeable to the word of God, and no man be puni&s;hed or di&s;countenanced by autho|rity for the &s;ame; and that an inforced uniformity of religion throughout a nation or &s;tate confounds the civil and religious, and denies the very principles of Chri&s;tianity and civility." They then bear their te&s;ti|mony to the covenant, and to the divine right of Pre&s;by|tery. They lament the imperfect &s;ettlement of their di&s;cipline by the parliament, and lay the foundation of all their calamities in the countenancing a public and general toleration: and conclude, "Upon all the&s;e con&s;iderations, we, the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, do hereby te&s;tify to our flocks, to all the kingdom, and to the reformed world, our great di&s;like of <HI>Prelacy, Era&s;tiani&s;m, Browni&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Independency;</HI> and our ut|ter abhorrence of <HI>Anti-&s;cripturi&s;m, Popery, Ariam&s;m, Sociniani&s;m, Arminiani&s;m, Antinomiani&s;m, Anabapti&s;m, Libertini&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Famili&s;m;</HI> and that we dete&s;t the fore|mentioned toleration, &s;o much pur&s;ued and endeavour|ed in this kingdom, accounting it unlawful and perni|cious."</P>
<P>Secondly, An extract from the <HI>ordinance again&s;t bla&s;phemy and here&s;y,</HI> by the parliament; to which, when the army marched from London towards Scot|land, the deprived Pre&s;byterian members had returned, and, having the &s;uperiority, took occa&s;ion to di&s;cover their principles and &s;pirit. It will hardly be credited, that per&s;ons who had them&s;elves experienced all the horrors of per&s;ecution and penal &s;tatutes, &s;hould di&s;|play &s;o per&s;ecuting, &s;o unchri&s;tian a di&s;po&s;ition. The ordinance was dated May 2, 1648, and ordains, "That all per&s;ons who &s;hall willingly maintain, publi&s;h, or defend, by preaching or writing, the following here&s;ies
<PB N="131" REF="136">with ob&s;tinacy, &s;hall, upon complaint or proof, by the oaths of two witne&s;&s;es, before two ju&s;tices of the peace, or confe&s;&s;ion of the party, be committed to pri&s;on, without bail or mainprize, till the next goal-delivery; and in ca&s;e the indictment &s;hall then be found, and the party upon his trial &s;hall not abjure the &s;aid error, and his defence and maintenance of the &s;ame, he &s;hall &s;uffer the pains of death, as in ca&s;e of felony, without benefit of clergy; and if he recant or abjure, he &s;hall remain in pri&s;on till he find &s;ureties that he will not maintain the &s;aid here&s;ies or errors any more; but if he relap&s;e, and is convicted a &s;econd time, he &s;hall &s;uffer death as before." The here&s;ies are as follow: "1. That there is no God. 2. That God is not omnipre&s;ent, omni&s;cient, almighty, eter|nal, and perfectly holy. 3. That the Father is not God, that the Son is not God, that the Holy Gho&s;t is not God, or that the&s;e three are not one eternal God; or, that Chri&s;t is not God equal with the Father. 4. The denial of the manhood of Chri&s;t, or that the god|head or manhood are di&s;tinct natures; or that the humanity of Chri&s;t is pure and un&s;potted of all &s;in. 5. The maintaining that Chri&s;t did not die, nor ri&s;e again, nor a&s;cend into heaven bodily. 6. The denying that the death of Chri&s;t is meritorious on the behalf of believers; or that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God. 7. The deny|ing that the holy &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;|tament are the word of God. 8. The denying of the re&s;urrection of the dead, and a future judgment." Some other errors of le&s;s demerit are then mentioned, as, "1. That all men &s;hall be &s;aved. 2. That man, by nature, hath free-will to turn to God. 3. That God may be wor&s;hipped in or by pictures or images. 4. That the &s;oul dies with the body, or, after death, goes neither to heaven or hell, but to purgatory. 5. That the &s;oul of man &s;leeps, when the body is dead. 6. That the revelations or workings of the Spirit are a rule of faith and Chri&s;tian life, tho' diver&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="137">from, or contrary to the written word of God. 7. That man is bound to believe no more than by his rea&s;on he can comprehend. 8. That the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, is no rule of Chri&s;tian life. 9. That a believer need not repent, or pray for pardon of &s;in. 10. That the two &s;acra|ments of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are not or|dinances commanded by the word of God. 11. That the bapti&s;m of infants is unlawful and void; and that &s;uch per&s;ons ought to be bapti&s;ed again. 12. That the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, as injoined by the ordinances and laws of the realm, is not according, or is contrary to the word of God. 13. That it is not lawful to join in public or family prayer, or to teach children to pray. 14. That the churches (Pre&s;byterian) of England are no true churches, nor their mini&s;ters and ordinances true mini&s;ters and ordinances; or, that the church-government by Pre&s;byters is antichri&s;tian or unlawful. 15. That magi&s;tracy, or the power of the civil magi&s;trate, by law e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, is unlawful. 16. That all u&s;e of arms, though for the public defence, and be the cau&s;e never &s;o ju&s;t, is un|lawful." The&s;e here&s;ies and errors were taken from the &s;peeches and writings of the Papi&s;ts, Arminians, Antinomians, Arians, Papi&s;ts, Quakers, &amp;c. of tho&s;e times. "Who&s;oever &s;hall maintain or defend the&s;e la&s;t errors, &s;hall, upon application, &amp;c. and conviction, by the oath of two witne&s;&s;es, or by his own confe&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. be ordered to renounce his &s;aid error or errors in the public congregation of the pari&s;h from whence the complaint comes, or where the offence was committed; and, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, he &s;hall be committed to pri&s;on till he find &s;ureties, that he &s;hall not publi&s;h or main|tain the &s;aid errors any more."</P>
<P>How different the principles of the Pre&s;byterians of the pre&s;ent times, the reader will pre&s;ently &s;ee. The Pre&s;byterians, under the various u&s;urpations, till the re&s;toration of Charles II. acted in concert with the
<PB N="133" REF="138">Scots, for re&s;toring the King upon the foot of the co|venant; &s;everal of their mini&s;ters carried on a corre&s;|pondence privately with the chiefs of that nation; and in&s;tead of taking the <HI>engagement</HI> to the pre&s;ent powers, called them u&s;urpers, and declined praying for them in their churches; they al&s;o declared again&s;t a general to|leration, which the army and parliament contended for; and, to widen the breach, the latter took away all the penal &s;tatutes for religion, Sept. 20, 1650, by an or|dinance.</P>
<P>While the Scots were rai&s;ing forces for the King's &s;ervice, a private corre&s;pondence was carried on be|tween the Pre&s;byterians in England and the Scots: large &s;ums of money were collected privately to for|ward an expedition into England; but the common|wealth &s;oon defeated their de&s;igns, &s;everal mini&s;ters and others were taken into cu&s;tody, and Mr. Love, one of them, and Mr. Gibbons, were tried and executed.</P>
<P>Under Oliver Cromwell's u&s;urpation, though their di&s;cipline was di&s;armed of its co-ercive power, he &s;till left them all that was &s;ufficient for religious purpo&s;es; they had their monthly or quarterly cla&s;&s;ical pre&s;byte|ries in every county, for the ordination of mini&s;ters, by impo&s;ition of hands, according to the directory. In the di&s;tant counties they entered into friendly a&s;&s;o|ciations for brotherly coun&s;el and advice, and were &s;till retained in the public mini&s;try; but as the Protec|tor was for the liberty of con&s;cience, their church-cen|&s;ures were now of no force, and the churches were indi&s;criminately be&s;towed on mini&s;ters of the Inde|pendants and other per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>Upon Richard Cromwell's re&s;igning the protecto|rate, the Pre&s;byterians &s;eeing no probability of re|&s;toring the covenant, or coming into power by the rump parliament, which was principally made up of enthu&s;ia&s;ts and declared enemies to monarchy, they entered into a &s;ort of confederacy with the royali&s;ts to re&s;tore the King and the old con&s;titution; and &s;e|veral
<PB N="134" REF="139">of their mini&s;ters appeared in the in&s;urrection of Sir George Booth, a Pre&s;byterian, in Che&s;hire, who&s;e party however was defeated by General Lambert.</P>
<P>General Monk having re&s;tored the &s;ecluded mem|bers of 1648, to their &s;eats in the hou&s;e, who were of the Pre&s;byterian party, they then carried all before them, and the city-mini&s;ters petitioned the parliament to take a more effectual cour&s;e again&s;t Papi&s;ts; to prohibit the Quakers opening their &s;hops on the Sabbath-day, and that the public mini&s;ters may not be di&s;turbed in their public &s;ervices. They al&s;o be&s;ought them to e&s;tabli&s;h the a&s;&s;embly's confe&s;&s;ion, directory and catechi&s;ms, &amp;c. &amp;c. All or mo&s;t of the&s;e things the hou&s;e complied with, and they ordered the &s;olemn league and cove|vant to be reprinted, and &s;et up in every church in England, and read publickly by the mini&s;ter, once every year: the pre&s;bytery was re&s;tored to all its powers, and the mini&s;ters of that per&s;ua&s;ion were put in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the livings in England. By their credulity, and the artifices of General Monk, they were made to believe that pre&s;bytery was to be the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the church of England, al&s;o, under King Charles II. in who&s;e re&s;toration they heartily concurred, and in fact brought it about, which they were capable of doing, as they were at that time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole power of England; the council of &s;tate, the chief officers of the army and navy, and the governors of the chief forts and garri|&s;ons, were theirs; and their clergy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion not only of the livings, but of both univer&s;ities. In &s;hort, they brought in the King without any &s;tipulation or conce&s;&s;ion on his part. Strange infatuation, which they &s;oon after had rea&s;on to repent! For they might be &s;ure that the old con&s;titution mu&s;t return with the King; that dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy was the only legal e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that all that had been done in fa|vour of pre&s;bytery, not having had the royal a&s;&s;ent, was void in law: therefore they and their friends who had
<PB N="135" REF="140">not Epi&s;copal ordination and induction into their livings, mu&s;t be looked upon as intruders, and not legal mi|ni&s;ters of the church of England. The King, to carry on the farce, as it was really on his &s;ide, when the mini&s;ters waited upon him in Holland, gave them &s;uch encouraging promi&s;es as rai&s;ed in &s;ome of them high expectations. When he came to Whitehall, he made ten of them his chaplains

Calamy, A&s;he, Ca&s;e, Baxter and Woodbridge.</NOTE>, at the in&s;tance of the Earl of Manche&s;ter; but before the expiration of the year 1660, many of the parochial clergy were pro&s;ecuted for not u&s;ing the book of Common Prayer; the ju&s;|tices and others in&s;i&s;ting, that the laws returned with the King, and that they ought not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with in the neglect of them. The &s;eque&s;tered clergy came out of their hiding places, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their former livings, by which &s;ome hundreds of the pre&s;byterian clergy were at once di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The two univer&s;ities were re&s;tored to their old di&s;cipline and government, and the heads of colleges, &amp;c. &amp;c. ejected in 1648, were put in again. New creations were made in both univer&s;ities, in favour of any, almo&s;t, who would declare their aver&s;ion to Pre&s;|bytery, and hearty affection of Epi&s;copal government. Deans and Chapters were al&s;o again re&s;tored, and Bi|&s;hops were promoted to the vacant &s;ees; and thus the church of England was re&s;tored to its former power, except only the peerage of the Bi&s;hops
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"No period of time, &s;ince the reformation, had more of the &s;pirit and appearance of religion, nor le&s;s open profanene&s;s and im|piety, (than under the late governments). Perhaps there was a little too much rigour and preci&s;ene&s;s in indifferent matters, which might be thought running into a contrary extreme. But the lu&s;ts of men were laid under a very great re&s;traint; better laws were never made again&s;t vice, and never better put in execution. The dre&s;s, the lan|guage and conver&s;ation of people was &s;ober and virtuous, and their manner of hou&s;e-keeping remarkably frugal. There was hardly a &s;ingle bankruptcy to be heard of in a year: the vices of drunkenne&s;s, fornication, profane &s;wearing, and every kind of debauchery, were bani&s;hed, and out of fa&s;hion. The clergy were laborious to exce&s;s in preaching and praying, in catechi&s;ing youth, and vi&s;iting their pari&s;hes. The magi&s;trates did their duty in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all kinds of games, &s;tage-plays, and abu&s;es in public hou&s;es. There was not a play acted in England for almo&s;t twenty years. The Lord's day was ob&s;erved with unu&s;ual &s;trictne&s;s, and there were a &s;et of as learned and pious youths in the univer&s;ity as had been known. So that if &s;uch a reformation of manners had obtained under a legal admini&s;tra|tion, they would have de&s;erved the character of the be&s;t of times." &mdash;"But when the legal con&s;titution was re&s;tored, there came in with it a torrent of all kinds of debauchery and wickedne&s;s. Men &s;et no bounds to their vicious appetites. Two play-hou&s;es were e|rected, women-actre&s;&s;es introduced upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage; the mo&s;t lewd and ob&s;cene plays were acted; nothing was to be &s;een at court but fea&s;ting, hard drinking, revelling, and amorous intrigues, which produced the mo&s;t enormous vices. The common people threw off the very profe&s;&s;ion of virtue and piety: the appearance of religion in any one furni&s;hed matter of ridicule to the profane mockers of real piety. To appear &s;erious, to make a con&s;cience of one's words and actions, was the way to be avoided as a &s;chi&s;matic, a &s;anatic, or a &s;ectarian. They who did not applaud the revived ceremonies were marked out for Pre&s;byterians, and every Pre&s;byterian was a rebel. The re&s;tored per&s;ons were notoriou&s;ly vicious and &s;candalous. Such was the general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners which attended the tide of joy that overflowed the nation upon his Maje&s;ty's re&s;toration." <HI>Neale,</HI> and to the &s;ame effect all other hi&s;torians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141">The King and the Duke of York were for a general toleration, in order to include the Papi&s;ts; and the Bi&s;hops, and Lord Clarendon at their head, were a|gain&s;t any comprehen&s;ion for, or conce&s;&s;ions to the Pre|&s;byterians.

For it had been ob&s;erved, that the
<PB N="137" REF="142">half-conformity of the Puritans before the war, had in mo&s;t cities and corporations occa&s;ioned a faction be|tween the main body and the lecturers, which latter had endeavoured to make them&s;elves popular at the expence of the hierarchy of the church. Be&s;ides, the Pre&s;byterians had too much credit in the elections of parliament-men: therefore they re&s;olved (&s;ays Burnet) to &s;eek the mo&s;t effectual means to ca&s;t them out of the church.</P>
<P>The well meaning Pre&s;byterians were, therefore, &s;triving again&s;t the &s;tream, and making intere&s;t with a &s;et of men, who were now laughing in their &s;leeves at the abject condition to which the folly of their adver|&s;aries had reduced them. "They offered Archbi&s;hop U&s;her's model of primitive Epi&s;copacy, as a plan of accommodation; that the &s;urplice, the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, and kneeling at the communion, &s;hould be left indifferent; they were content to &s;et a&s;ide the a&s;&s;embly's confe&s;&s;ion, and let the articles of the church of England take place, with &s;ome amendments." His Maje&s;ty de&s;ired a number of their mini&s;ters, who were introduced to him by the Earl of Manche&s;ter, to crave his interpo|&s;ition for reconciling the differences of the church, to draw up &s;uch propo&s;als as they thought meet, for an agreement about church-government, and to &s;et down the mo&s;t they could yield. Accordingly the city-mini|&s;ters, with &s;ome of their country brethren, met at Si|on college, and after two or three weeks deliberation agreed upon a paper, which, together with Archbi&s;hop U&s;her's reduction of Epi&s;copacy, they offered to the King with a proper addre&s;s. To this paper the Bi&s;hops publi&s;hed a reply; upon which the Pre&s;byterians &s;ent a warm remon&s;trance to the Bi&s;hops, and a defence of their propo&s;als; which concludes thus, "We perceive your <HI>coun&s;els again&s;t peace</HI> are not likely to be fru&s;trated. Your de&s;ires concerning us are likely to be accom|pli&s;hed. You are like to be gratified with our &s;ilence and ejection; and yet we will believe, that <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are

<P>Their eyes now began to open, and they perceived, with regret, their credulity in expecting an agreement with the Bi&s;hops, who appeared to be exa&s;perated, and determined to bind them over to the old e&s;tabli&s;hment. The former &s;everities were already revived, and the laws to be put in execution again&s;t &s;uch as did not make u&s;e of the old liturgy. Many were &s;u&s;pended and turned out of their livings on this account. Upon application for redre&s;s to the King, he told them he would put what he thought fit to grant them into the form of a declaration, which they &s;hould peru&s;e before it was made public. A copy was accordingly delivered to them, with liberty to make exceptions: they peti|tioned for &s;ome further amendments and alterations; upon which the King appointed a day to hear what could be &s;aid on both &s;ides, and came to Chancellor Hyde's hou&s;e, October 22, 1660, attended by the Dukes of Albemarle and Ormond, the Earls of Man|che&s;ter and Angle&s;ea, and Lord Hollis, for that pur|po&s;e

<P>The doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance were now revived, men obnoxious and inveterate to the Pre&s;byterians were preferred to bi&s;hoprics, and were compen&s;ated for their late &s;ufferings, by the large &s;ums

<P>From this time per&s;ecution again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians commenced. One Mr. Zach.

Another (Mr. Par&s;ons, rector of Wem, in Shrop&s;hire) was taken from his wife by &s;oldiers, for &s;editious preaching and non-conformity to the ceremonies, and fined two hundred pounds, with impri&s;onment till paid.

So eager were the &s;piritual courts to revive the exerci&s;e of their power; and &s;o &s;trongly did the tide run again&s;t the unhappy Pre&s;byterians!" By the act for re&s;toring the old &s;e|que&s;tered clergy, &s;ome hundreds of the non-conformi&s;t

The mini&s;|try &s;oon after did every thing in their power to throw the odium of plots and con&s;piracies upon the Pre&s;by|terians, for which many were taken into cu&s;tody, but relea&s;ed afterwards, without pro&s;ecution; by the&s;e de|vices they facilitated the pa&s;&s;ing the penal &s;tatutes that were coming upon the carpet.

<P>The Savoy conference ended without any good ef|fect, and the act of uniformity received the royal a&s;|&s;ent, May 19, 1662, by which the terms of confor|mity were higher than before the civil wars, and the common-prayer book rendered more exceptionable. By inforcing this act

<P>I have now gone as comprehen&s;ively as I could thro' this gloomy reign, in which &s;o many thou&s;ands of pious and good per&s;ons were ruined for con&s;cience &s;ake; but it mu&s;t be remembered, that the public liberty was ruined with them, and that the whole con&s;titution, at the time of Charles's death, was in a manner brought to its di&s;&s;olution. Yet, when the nation was groaning under every oppre&s;&s;ion, when every vice &s;talked abroad in open day light, and corruption of manners, and pro&s;titution of heart and tongue, were even fa&s;hion|able, remember, readers, and blu&s;h for your country, there were wretches abandoned enough to addre&s;s this voluptuous Monarch, in &s;trains that were impious, and could with propriety be only a&s;cribed to God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>James II. at the beginning of his &s;hort reign, re|vived the per&s;ecution again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, the majority of whom were Pre&s;byterians; which was carried on with the mo&s;t barbarous rigour, and even exceeded tho&s;e in his brother's reign; but the favou|rite &s;cheme, which had proved abortive under that Prince, was &s;edulou&s;ly pur&s;ued by James, of making the Pre&s;byterians and other Di&s;&s;enters tools to obtain a general toleration, by which the Papi&s;ts were to be re|lieved from the penal laws and te&s;ts. As he imagined it impracticable to obtain his de&s;ire legally, he deter|mined to attempt it by his <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing power,</HI> and began to care&s;s the Non-conformi&s;ts, and to &s;how them great favour; their mini&s;ters were encouraged to &s;et up their conventicles, which had been di&s;continued or held very &s;ecretly for &s;ome years; and the King had it in|timated
<PB N="146" REF="151">timated every where, that he would not have their meetings di&s;turbed. But the Di&s;&s;enters &s;eeing the King's drift, now joined with their per&s;ecutors of the Church of England, generou&s;ly giving up their pri|vate re&s;entments, however ju&s;t, to their fears of Po|pery and &s;lavery, which were making large &s;trides to|wards the de&s;truction of religious and civil liberty, of which the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing power,</HI> and the <HI>declaration for liber|ty of con&s;cience,</HI> were to be the principal engines
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol iii. of this work, p. 465, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. This wi&s;e conduct of the Di&s;&s;enters certainly &s;aved the church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus, however, an end was put to the pro&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters by the penal laws, though the laws them&s;elves were not legally repealed or &s;u&s;pend|ed till after the revolution
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Upwards of &s;ixty thou&s;and per&s;ons &s;uffered upon a religious account between the re&s;toration and the abdication of King James, five thou&s;and of whom died in pri&s;on.

<P>Tho' in pur&s;uance of the declarations for liberty of con&s;cience, &amp;c. the Di&s;&s;enters were not only at their liberty to wor&s;hip in their &s;everal ways, and were ad|mitted to &s;erve in all offices of profit and tru&s;t, they could not be brought to acknowledge <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing power;</HI> tho' many to them addre&s;&s;ed the King with thanks for the freedom they now enjoyed from per&s;ecution; a mea&s;ure, however, that was not approved by their elders and more cautious mini&s;ters.

<P>The Pre&s;byterians concurred heartily in the Revo|lution; and when the Prince of Orange came to St. James's, December 18, 1688, &s;everal of their mini&s;ters attended him, with the Bi&s;hop of London, and many of the clergy, to congratulate him upon his &s;ucce&s;s. January 2, about ninety of the Non-conformi&s;t mini|&s;ters waited upon the Prince with a &s;eparate addre&s;s, to which they received a mo&s;t cordial an&s;wer. When King William and Queen Mary were &s;ettled on the throne, the Di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters waited on their Ma|je&s;ties with addre&s;&s;es of congratulation, which were delivered by Dr. Bates: and though many generous attempts made by the King for a comprehen&s;ion were rendered abortive by the oppo&s;ition of the Jacobites and Tories; yet the memorable bill <HI>for toleration of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> which is the ba&s;is of their pre&s;ent liberty, was pa&s;&s;ed in their favour

<P>We believe, &s;ays Mr. Pearce, bapti&s;m is a pledge and token both of the benefits which God is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us, and of our acceptance of them; and the promi&s;e whereby we oblige our&s;elves to him, and that therefore no other &s;ign hereof &s;hould be u&s;ed

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts's Works, vol. III. p. 680.

<P>The &s;acrament of bapti&s;m, is that wherein by being wa&s;hed with water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the baptized per&s;on &s;olemnly gives up him&s;elf to God, through his Son, to be governed by the go&s;pel he taught, in expectation of the aids of that Spirit, who&s;e miraculous gifts proved the truth of the go&s;pel; and whereby he obliges him&s;elf to for&s;ake all his former impurities, which he thus acknowledges, while,

<P>Touching eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, this can by no means bind the con&s;cience; for, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the only foundation upon which a man can act con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly, is his private per&s;ua&s;ion; it limits and circum|&s;cribes the extent of human authority and is not li|mited and circum&s;cribed by it; if a deci&s;ion of men binds any per&s;on, it is in matters wherein he thinks they have power; when they carry their preten&s;ions farther, and determine things wherein his judgment does not allow their authority, their decrees mu&s;t be re|garded by him as void; and, con&s;equently, if any one's con&s;cience di&s;&s;allows human authority, in the lowe&s;t in&s;tances wherein it is exerci&s;ed, its acts can produce no obligation upon him; el&s;e the rights of private judgment might be invaded in all ca&s;es, and con&s;cience given up to the will of men; for it is as really injured if a man be forced to act again&s;t its light, in a circum&s;tance or matter of ceremony, as an article of faith; for what&s;oever is not of faith, is &s;in; from whence it is plain, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority has no power over con&s;cience; indeed none at all but what con&s;cience gives it, and therefore mu&s;t yield to its &s;u|perior where their voices differ.</P>

<P><HI>Art.</HI> I. The fir&s;t and great article of my belief (from natural and revealed religion) is the exi&s;tence of one God, who&s;e power is uncontroulable, who&s;e knowledge is infinite, who&s;e pre&s;ence is immen&s;ity, who&s;e being is eternity, who&s;e beneficence is boundle&s;s mercy, who&s;e name is love, a Spirit immutable in his nature, and unchangeable in all his perfections; the Creator of all worlds, and of all beings that exi&s;t.&mdash;I believe that his providence is univer&s;al, and that his &s;upreme go|vernment is over all his works; exerci&s;ed with the mo&s;t per&s;ect wi&s;dom, and invariable goodne&s;s, mo&s;t con|ducive to his own glory and the happine&s;s of his crea|tures.&mdash;I believe that this all-wife and good God
<PB N="161" REF="166">ought to be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and truth, free from corrupt affections, and with the mo&s;t pious and de|vout di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> II. I believe that God, the parent of all nature, directed by the e&s;&s;ential beneficence of his own perfect mind, formed man for the purpo&s;es of wi&s;dom, virtue, and happine&s;s, and furni&s;hed him with all abilities &s;uit|able to an&s;wer the&s;e important ends: but that our fir&s;t parent, by violating the expre&s;s law of his Maker, fell from his innocence, his dignity and happine&s;s, and when &s;in entered into the world, death entered by &s;in. &mdash;I believe that in pity to the unhappy &s;tate of man|kind, and in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the weakne&s;s and imbe|cility of human nature, God, at &s;undry times and in diver&s;e manners, afforded &s;uch revelation of him&s;elf, as was mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of his creatures: that as rea&s;onable beings, capable of a law, they had life and death &s;et before them, had liberty of choice con&s;equently, and were accountable to God for their conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> III. I believe al&s;o, that, in the mo&s;t &s;uitable and fitting time, God &s;ent his only Son into the world, that the world thro' him might be &s;aved:&mdash;that the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t reveals the mo&s;t noble &s;entiments of the Deity, and of that duty we owe to him:&mdash;that it contains the mo&s;t &s;ublime precepts of morality, with all the evidences of rea&s;on, and all the dignity of di|vine authority.&mdash;From hence I am led to believe what is therein farther taught, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins and everla&s;ting life, on the conditions of our repentance, faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the one mediator, and obedience to his go&s;pel. The&s;e doctrines of the go&s;pel I believe to be the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of religion, and this method of &s;alvation mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the perfections of God, with the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of mankind, and mo&s;t conducive to their highe&s;t perfection and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="167"><HI>Art.</HI> IV. I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t in&s;tituted two po&s;itive ordinances, bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; by the fir&s;t of the&s;e we are initiated into the Chri&s;tian religion, and by the latter we are to commemorate our Lord's death till he come.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> V. I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by his holy and unblameable life, hath left us a perfect example; that, by his death, he perfected his obedience, and made a proper oblation to God for us; that he aro&s;e again from the dead, to procure and a&s;certain our re&s;urrection to immortality; that he a&s;cended to his God and our God, and ever liveth as our advocate with the Father, and that through him our &s;incere, tho' imperfect, obe|dience will be accepted.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> VI. I believe that God hath promi&s;ed the di|rection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit to all tho&s;e who &s;in|cerely and humbly implore it; and that the aid of the divine Spirit, in conjunction with our own endeavours, is &s;ufficient to the duty required of us; that the Holy Spirit was given to the Apo&s;tles of our Lord in an ex|traordinary manner, for the propagation and confirma|tion of the go&s;pel, and is &s;till continued and em|ployed in a general way, to promote the happine&s;s and &s;alvation of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> I believe that what&s;oever circum&s;tances may confound the di&s;tinctions betwixt men in this world, there will be a future &s;tate, a &s;tate of impartial and righteous retribution, when every one will receive according to his deeds done in the body, whether they were good, or whether they were evil.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the articles of my belief, all that I e&s;teem e&s;&s;ential to a Chri&s;tian; and whatever controver&s;ies may have ari&s;en in matters of le&s;s con&s;equence, as they are not clearly revealed, cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion, and, therefore, &s;u&s;pend my conclu&s;ions concern|ing them, till that deci&s;ive day when all difficulties &s;hall be removed, and the &s;ecrets of all hearts will be manife&s;t.</P>

<P>We pre&s;ume not to offer to you any articles of faith or religion in the words of men, or canons of human contrivance, for your a&s;&s;ent and &s;ub&s;cription. But as there is a propriety in the thing it&s;elf, and as it is the religion of Chri&s;t only, in its native and uncorrupted &s;implicity, of which we would be under&s;tood to ap|prove and declare you a mini&s;ter, will you give us, on this occa&s;ion, your own ideas of the general plan of that excellent and divine religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which has been, and is from henceforth, by this &s;olemn dedi|cation of your&s;elf to it, to be the chief and important &s;ubject of the labours of your life?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the view, Sir, that you are plea&s;ed to repre|&s;ent it, I readily con&s;ent to lay before you, and this a&s;&s;embly, a general account of the religious principles which I profe&s;s, and apprehend I have drawn from the pure fountains of religious knowledge.</P>
<P>By the exerci&s;e of my rational powers upon my&s;elf and other objects, I am led into the firm belief of the exi&s;tence of an eternal, independent, immen&s;e Being, which we call God, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, with all conceivable, all po&s;&s;ible perfec|tion of nature, character, and &s;tate; the original cau&s;e of all other beings, the &s;ource of all the excel|lence, perfection, and happine&s;s that obtain in the uni|ver&s;e; the pre&s;erver of the whole world, the righte|ous governor and judge of moral agents, among&s;t whom is the race of mankind.</P>
<P>But the character and moral government of this glorious Being, e&s;pecially his di&s;pen&s;ations towards the human race, with their duty, are more particularly and clearly repre&s;ented in the &s;criptures, which are of divine original, and contain a ju&s;t account of all ne|ce&s;&s;ary truth relating to religion.</P>
<P>From them I learn, that the &s;upreme governor of the world, to &s;hew his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t &s;in, bani&s;hed our
<PB N="167" REF="172">fir&s;t parents from paradi&s;e in which he had placed them, for di&s;obedience to a po&s;itive prohibition; and inflicted upon them the penalty threatened to their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, though not without giving them the promi&s;e of a deli|verer from the evils to which they had &s;ubjected them|&s;elves and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding ages of the world this promi&s;e was repeated for the encouragement of well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons; and various means were made u&s;e of by the wi&s;e and and merciful God, to pre&s;erve or re&s;tore true religion among&s;t men; particularly it was renewed to Abraham, one branch of who&s;e family he cho&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the world by peculiar laws and rites of wor&s;hip, to convey to po&s;terity the knowledge of this promi&s;e with &s;everal important doctrines and duties of religion.</P>
<P>At the time appointed by infinite wi&s;dom, as mo&s;t proper for it, he &s;ent the long-expected per&s;on into the world, to &s;ave men from perdition, and bring them to everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>The well-beloved Son of God, in obedience to his Father, and from compa&s;&s;ion to mankind, took fle&s;h, and was born of a Virgin, lived in a mean condition, conver&s;ed familiarly with men, taught the great doc|trines and duties of true religion, then very much un|known and neglected, corrupted by traditions, and human inventions; illu&s;trated by his own temper and conduct the pure doctrines and rules of duty which he taught; &s;etting an example of &s;trict purity, of warm benevolence, of &s;ublime piety, of univer&s;al holine&s;s; and proved al&s;o his divine commi&s;&s;ion and character, as the Me&s;&s;iah, by miraculous works.</P>
<P>Thus did this divine teacher proceed for a con&s;ider|able time, gloriou&s;ly di&s;playing the excellency of the divine perfections and government, and his own good will to mankind, till he was &s;eized by wicked men, who unju&s;tly condemned and crucified him. But the violent oppo&s;ition which they made to his cau&s;e, and
<PB N="168" REF="173">the evils they inflicted on his per&s;on, were &s;o far from fru&s;trating the great de&s;ign on which he came into the world, from putting a &s;top to the exerci&s;e of his piety to God, and his beneficence to men, that they afforded him an opportunity of promoting it in the mo&s;t effec|tual manner; for as by the&s;e la&s;t &s;ufferings he &s;et us an example of a &s;teady adherence to the cau&s;e of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, under the greate&s;t natural and temporal evils that can befal us, &s;o in death he gave him&s;elf for us an of|fering and a &s;acrifice to God of a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour.</P>
<P>Nor did he long remain under the dominion of death, for on the third day he was rai&s;ed again by the mighty power of God; appeared to, and conver&s;ed with many of his di&s;ciples, e&s;pecially the Apo&s;tles, who were particularly appointed to be witne&s;&s;es of this great event, by which he was declared in the mo&s;t convincing manner, to be the Son of God and Saviour of the world. And after conver&s;ing with them &s;everal times for the &s;pace of forty days, and in&s;tructing them in the things relating to the kingdom of God, com|manding them to pro&s;elyte all nations, bapti&s;ing them into the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, teaching them to ob&s;erve whatever he had commanded them; he was taken up into heaven from among them, and &s;eated at the right-hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, as a Prince and a Saviour to give re|pentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins unto all people.</P>
<P>Ve&s;ted with all power both in heaven and earth, &s;oon after his a&s;cen&s;ion, he conferred the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t upon them, which qualified them in the be&s;t manner for propagating his religion in the world.</P>
<P>This religion, as publi&s;hed by Chri&s;t and his Apo|&s;tles, and contained in the &s;criptures, is a mo&s;t excel|lent and perfect in&s;titution, admirably adapted to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of mankind. It contains the laws of nature, with various additional directions, a&s;|&s;i&s;tances, promi&s;es, and motives &s;uited to our unhappy circum&s;tances of ignorance, weakne&s;s, and guilt, and
<PB N="169" REF="174">directly tending to promote our purity, comfort, and eternal felicity. For as it has provided a remedy for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears and &s;orrows of humble per&s;ons, &s;en&s;ible of their guilt and infirmities, by off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring a free pardon to them who believe and repent; effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to all who are de&s;irous of holine&s;s, and exert them&s;elves in the way appointed for obtaining it, and eternal life to them who per&s;evere in well doing; &s;o, on the other hand, it has taken away all ground of hope from im|penitent and carele&s;s men, by a&s;&s;uring them, that, without holine&s;s, none &s;hall ever &s;ee the Lord, but that all who obey not the go&s;pel, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and the glory of his power.</P>
<P>For pre&s;erving the knowledge of this excellent reli|gion, and accompli&s;hing its ends in the world it is agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t that &s;ocieties be form|ed, in which the doctrines and duties of his go&s;pel are taught and inculcated, and the Father wor&s;hipped through him, the only Mediator between God and men. And he appointed two peculiar &s;ervices of re|ligion, <HI>viz.</HI> Bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; the for|mer to be ob&s;erved only once, as a token of admi&s;&s;ion into his church, and of a right to the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom; the latter to be celebrated often, in com|memoration of his dying for us, and as an acknow|ledgment of our Chri&s;tian obligations.</P>
<P>Though the apo&s;tolic office cea&s;ed with the lives of tho&s;e who were fir&s;t ordained to it by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, yet it is &s;uitable to his directions, that pa&s;tors and teachers be continued throughout all ages, for preach|ing his religion, offering up prayers, and admini&s;ter|ing his ordinances.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the gifts which were conferred on the fir&s;t mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are not continued, I apprehend that faithful diligent men, who give them|&s;elves to reading, meditation, and prayer, that they may under&s;tand the will of God, enter into the true

For ex|cellently as this kingdom is con&s;tituted, and well as it is furni&s;hed with means for its pre&s;ervation and pro&s;pe|rity, it is not left to the mere natural operation of tho&s;e means, but our Lord con&s;tantly pre&s;ides in it, directing its affairs, and by his influence promoting the improvement and happine&s;s of his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Thus does our Lord exerci&s;e his power and grace towards mankind at pre&s;ent; but they will be more &s;en&s;ibly and gloriou&s;ly di&s;played hereafter, when, de|&s;cending from heaven in his own and his Father's glory, he &s;hall rai&s;e the dead, convene all men before his tri|bunal, with unerring judgment &s;eparate the good from the bad; and a&s;&s;igning the wicked to mi&s;ery propor|tioned to their guilt, &s;hall reward the righteous with everla&s;ting life and happine&s;s, ri&s;ing according to the perfection of their obedience and holine&s;s, though in|finitely above their de&s;erts. Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom unto the Father, that God may be all in all.</P>
<P>This I &s;incerely deliver as a general idea of that reli|gion which I firmly believe; and according to which I hope, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to form both my public and private conduct, that I may &s;ave my&s;elf and others.</P>

This they are &s;ure mu&s;t have been the form of government in the primitive church. Not that they claim an entire independency with regard to other churches for they agree, that, in all occa&s;ions of offences, the offending church is to &s;ubmit to an open examination by other neighbouring churches, and on their per&s;i&s;ting in their error or mi&s;carriage, they then are to renounce all Chri&s;tian communion with them, until they repent, which is all the authority or eccle&s;ia&s;tical power that one church may exerci&s;e over another, unle&s;s they call in the civil ma|gi&s;trate, for which they find no authority in &s;cripture.

They &s;eemed, in fact, not only concerned for them&s;elves, but for tender con&s;ciences of all per|&s;ua&s;ions. At this time the Independants were courted by the King; but, though they were enemies to the Pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, they dared not tru&s;t a Mo|narch who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions &s;eemed directed by nothing but his own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Pre&s;byterians, in 1646, petitioned the hou&s;e again&s;t the toleration of &s;ectaries, which was &s;e|conded by the Scots; the Independants procured a counter petition from the city, with a great number of hands, "applauding the labours and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the parliament in the cau&s;e of liberty, and praying them to go on with managing the affairs of the king|dom, according to their wi&s;doms, and not &s;uffer the free-born people of England to be in&s;laved on any pretence what&s;oever; <HI>nor to &s;uffer any &s;et of people to pre&s;cribe to them in matters of government or con&s;cience,</HI> and the petitioners will &s;tand by them with their lives and fortunes." The Pre&s;byterians were hereupon pre&s;|&s;ed, by the wi&s;e parliament, who only wanted to gain time, to an&s;wer, in the a&s;&s;embly, their que&s;tions re|lating to the <HI>jus divinum</HI> of pre&s;bytery. Accordingly the a&s;&s;embly went to work for that purpo&s;e; but the
<PB N="181" REF="186">Independants took the opportunity to leave them, re|fu&s;ing ab&s;olutely to be concerned in the affair. The King, who was in the Scots army, when the treaty with the parliament was broken off, attempted to bring the Scots nation over to his intere&s;t by playing the Independants again&s;t them, but to little purpo&s;e, though he told them the be&s;t way to de&s;troy the &s;ecta|rians was to join with the Epi&s;copalians, and admit of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of both religions; "that they could not imagine there was any hopes of &s;ilencing the Independant party, which undoubtedly will get a toleration in religion from the parliament of England, unle&s;s you join with me, in that way that I have pro|po&s;ed for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of my crown."</P>
<P>The army, at this time, was compo&s;ed of Indepen|dants, with a mixture of Anabapti&s;ts and other &s;ecta|ries, who, when they found the Pre&s;byterians, even in their treaty with the King, of 1648, in&s;i&s;ting upon Pre&s;byterian uniformity, without making the lea&s;t provi&s;ion for that liberty of con&s;cience they had been contending for, grew outrageous, and at length buried King, Parliament, and Pre&s;bytery, in the ruins of the con&s;titution

It con&s;i&s;ts of thirty-three chapters, in which are almo&s;t two hundred di&s;|tinct
<PB N="183" REF="188">articles of faith and di&s;cipline; though the whole time of the &s;ynod's &s;e&s;&s;ions was not above eleven or twelve days. "In mo&s;t places this confe&s;&s;ion runs in the very words of the a&s;&s;embly's confe&s;&s;ion; and the difference (&s;ays Neale) between the two confe&s;&s;ions, in points of doctrine, are &s;o very &s;mall, that the modern Independants have, in a manner, laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of it in their families, and agreed with the Pre&s;byterians in the u&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly's catechi&s;m." At the end of the confe&s;&s;ion there is a chapter of di&s;cipline, in which they a&s;&s;ert, "that every particular &s;ociety of vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ors agreeing to walk together in the &s;aith and order of the go&s;pel is a complete church, and has full power within it&s;elf to elect and ordain all church-officers, to exclude all offenders, and to do all other acts relating to the edification and well-being of the church. That the way of ordaining officers, that is, pa&s;tors, teachers, or elders, is, after their election, by the &s;uffrage of the church, to &s;et them apart with fa&s;ting and prayer, and impo&s;ition of the hands of the elder&s;hip of the church, tho' if there be no impo&s;ition of hands, they are neverthele&s;s rightly con&s;tituted mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t; but they do not allow that ordinati|on to the work of the mini&s;try, tho' it be by per&s;ons rightly ordained, does convey any office-power, with|out a previous election of the church. That no per|&s;ons may admini&s;ter the &s;acrament but &s;uch as are or|dained and appointed thereunto. Nor are the pa&s;tors of one church obliged to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments to any other, than to the members of that church to whom they &s;tand related in that capacity. Nor may any per&s;on be added to the church, as a private mem|ber, but by the con&s;ent of the church, after a confe&s;|&s;ion of his faith, declared by him&s;elf, or otherwi&s;e manife&s;ted. They di&s;allow the power of all &s;tated &s;y|nods, pre&s;byteries, convocations, and a&s;&s;emblies of di|vines, over particular churches; but admit that in ca&s;es of difficulty, or difference relating to doctrine or
<PB N="184" REF="189">order, churches may meet together by their me&s;&s;engers in &s;ynods or councils, to con&s;ider and give advice, but without exerci&s;ing any juri&s;diction. La&s;tly, They agree that churches con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons &s;ound in the faith, and of good conver&s;ation, ought not to refu&s;e com|munion with each other, tho' they walk not in all things according to the &s;ame rule of church order; and if they judge other churches to be true churches, tho' le&s;s pure, they may receive to occa&s;ional communi|on &s;uch members of tho&s;e churches as are credibly te&s;|tified to be godly, and to live without offence. The&s;e opinions, they add, "may appear new to a great many people, becau&s;e they have not been openly and publickly profe&s;&s;ed in the Engli&s;h nation; but we are able to trace the foot&s;teps of an Independant congre|gational way in the anciente&s;t practice of the church, and in the writings of the &s;ounde&s;t prote&s;tant divines. That their principles do not, in the lea&s;t, interfere with the authority of the civil magi&s;trate, nor do they con|cern them&s;elves upon any occa&s;ions with him, any further than to implore his protection, for the pre&s;er|vation of the peace and liberty of their churches." They glory in this, that ever &s;ince they appeared in the world, they have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tian liberty. "We have always maintained (&s;ay they) this principle, <HI>That among all Chri&s;tian &s;tates and churches there ought to be a forbearance and mu|tual indulgence to Chri&s;tians of all per&s;ua&s;ions, that keep to, and hold fa&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ary foundations of faith.</HI> This principle we have maintained for the &s;ake of others, <HI>when we our&s;elves had no need of it.</HI>" They conclude with thankfulne&s;s to their pre&s;ent governors, for per|mitting tho&s;e who could not comply with the Pre&s;by|terian e&s;tabli&s;hment, to enjoy the liberty of their con|&s;ciences, and equal encouragement and protection with others; and that this liberty is e&s;tabli&s;hed by a law, as long as they di&s;turb not the public peace. "This &s;hould engage us (they conclude) to promote the honour and
<PB N="185" REF="190">pro&s;perity of &s;uch a government; to be peaceably di&s;|po&s;ed one towards another, and to love as brethren, fora&s;much as the differences between Pre&s;byterians and Independants, are differences between fellow-&s;er|vants, and that neither of them have authority from God or man, to impo&s;e their opinions upon one ano|ther." The reader will join with me in thinking this a mo&s;t rational and Chri&s;tian conclu&s;ion, and that it does great credit to the &s;ynod.</P>
<P>When General Monk clo&s;ed with the Pre&s;byterians, tho' before he had inclined to the Independants, and kept an Independant chaplain about him; when every thing went in their way, and the parliament lay at their mercy, the Independants offered to &s;tand by their friends in the hou&s;e, to rai&s;e four new regiments from among them&s;elves, to force Monk back into Scotland, and to rai&s;e 100,000l. for the u&s;e of the army, pro|vided they would protect them in their religious liber|ties, which they apprehended Monk and <HI>the Presbyte|rians de&s;igned to &s;ubvert;</HI> but it was too late for &s;uch propo&s;als to be accepted; the old regiments were di&s;|lodged, and Monk in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city.

<P>When the King and the hierarchy were re&s;tored, the Independants and Anabapti&s;ts petitioned for a tolera|tion, but during the whole reign of Charles II. they were &s;ubject to the &s;ame per&s;ecutions and &s;everities with the re&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;uffered very &s;everely on many occa&s;ions.

<P>Nor can I forget a laudable example in another mi|ni&s;ter of that &s;ociety, who &s;ucceeded Dr. Fo&s;ter, I mean the Rev. Mr. Caleb Fleming.

<P>THE BAPTISTS (or Anabapti&s;ts) were &s;o &s;tiled from their practice of bapti&s;ing believers, think|ing them the only proper &s;ubjects of that in&s;titution, and that the mode of bapti&s;m &s;hould be performed by immer&s;ion, the method made u&s;e of by the primitive Chri&s;tians for the three fir&s;t centuries after the promul|gation of the go&s;pel

<P>Some Hi&s;torians, indeed, deduce their origin, as a &s;ect, from much later times, and affirm they fir&s;t &s;prang up in Germany, and &s;eparated them&s;elves from the Lutherans, becau&s;e the doctrine of the&s;e reformers was imperfect, or not brought to the primitive &s;tandard; as the proper mode and &s;ubject of bapti&s;m was not al|lowed by them to be nece&s;&s;ary in the performance of the rite

<P>It is pretty clear, from the con&s;ent of many learned authors, that Wickliffe, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h reformer, denied infant-bapti&s;m to be lawful; for one of his tenets was, "That tho&s;e are fools and pre&s;umptuous, which affirm &s;uch infants not to be &s;aved, which die without bapti&s;m; and he denied, that all &s;ins are abo|li&s;hed in bapti&s;m

As it was the opinion that bap|ti&s;m wa&s;hed away original &s;in, and by a &s;ecret virtue regenerated the per&s;on, and that the infant dying without it, was in danger of damnation, that opinion began, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the practice of infant-bapti&s;m; therefore, this foundation being removed, that practice

<P>Though &s;everal Anabapti&s;ts were put to death, and bani&s;hed, for their opinions, in the reign of Henry VIII. yet I &s;hall begin their hi&s;tory with the words of Bi&s;hop Burnet
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, part ii. p. 110. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, and which I look upon to be proper for my purpo&s;e. "At this time, 1547, there were many Anabapti&s;ts in &s;everal parts of England; they were generally Germans, whom the revolutions there had forced to change their &s;eats. Upon Luther's fir&s;t preaching in Germany, there aro&s;e many, who, build|ing on &s;ome of his principles, carried things much fur|ther than he did. The chief foundation he laid down was, that the &s;cripture was to be the only rule of Chri&s;tians. Upon this many argued, that the my&s;te|ries of the Trinity, and Chri&s;t's incarnation and &s;uffer|rings, of the fall of man, and the aids of grace, were indeed philo&s;ophical &s;ubtilities, and only pretended to be deduced from &s;cripture, as almo&s;t all opinions of re|ligion were, and therefore they rejected them. A|mong&s;t the&s;e the bapti&s;m of infants was one. They held that to be no bapti&s;m, and &s;o were rebapti&s;ed. But from this, which was mo&s;t taken notice of, as be|ing a vi&s;ible thing, they carried all the general name of Anabapti&s;ts. On the 12th of April there was a com|plaint brought to the council, that with the &s;trangers that were come into England, &s;ome of that per&s;ua&s;ion had come over, and were di&s;&s;eminating their errors, and making pro&s;elytes: &s;o a commi&s;&s;ion was ordered
<PB N="196" REF="203">for the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Bi&s;hops of Ely, Worce&s;ter, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Chiche&s;ter, Lincoln, and Roche&s;ter, Sir William Petre, Sir Thomas Smith, Dr. Cox, Dr. May, and &s;ome others, three of them being a <HI>quorum,</HI> to examine and &s;earch after all Ana|bapti&s;ts, heretics, or contemners of the Common-prayer. They were to endeavour to reclaim them, to enjoin them penance, and give them ab&s;olution, or, if they were ob&s;tinate, to excommunicate and impri&s;on them, and to deliver them over to the &s;ecular power, to be further proceeded again&s;t. Some trade&s;men in London were brought before the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners in May, and were per&s;uaded to abjure their former opinions, one of which was, that the bapti&s;m of infants was not profitable. One of tho&s;e, who thus abjured, was commanded to carry a faggot, next Sunday, at St. Paul's, where there &s;hould be a &s;ermon, &s;etting forth his here&s;y. But there was another of the&s;e extreme ob&s;tinate, Joan Bocher, commonly called Joan of Kent. She denied that Chri&s;t was truly incarnate of the Virgin, who&s;e fle&s;h being &s;in|ful, he could take none of it; but the word, by the con&s;ent of the inward man in the Virgin, took fle&s;h of her; the&s;e were her words. They took much pains about her, and had many conferences with her; but &s;he was &s;o extravagantly conceited of her own notions, that &s;he rejected all they &s;aid with &s;corn. Whereupon &s;he was adjudged an ob&s;tinate heretic, and &s;o left to the &s;ecular power
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 100.</NOTE>." In 1550, the Anabapti&s;ts were excepted out of a general pardon. The&s;e Anabapti&s;ts were cer|tainly of an untractable and ob&s;tinate temper; "but (&s;ays Burnet) for the other &s;ort of the Anabapti&s;ts, who only denied infant-bapti&s;m
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See ibid. p. 129.</NOTE>, I find no &s;everities u&s;ed to them, but &s;everal books were written again&s;t them, to which they wrote &s;ome an&s;wers. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the Bapti&s;ts greatly increa&s;ed, and
<PB N="197" REF="204">were &s;ubjected to impri&s;onment and bani&s;hment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. of this work, p. 157.</NOTE>. Some few indeed recanted their errors, as Fuller ob&s;erves; but two were burnt in Smithfield. In the reign of James I. among the per&s;ecuted exiles that fled to Hol|land were &s;everal Anabapti&s;ts, who &s;et up a church un|der the pa&s;tor&s;hip of Mr. John Smith, who had been a mini&s;ter of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; but they were vio|lently oppo&s;ed by the other Puritan exiles, from whom they received much abu&s;e in books written again&s;t their opinions. In this reign Edward Wightman, a Bap|ti&s;t, of Burton upon Trent, was burnt at Litchfield. He was the la&s;t martyr that &s;uffered by this cruel kind of death in England; and it may be remarked, that William Sawtre, the fir&s;t that &s;uffered in that manner, for his religious opinions, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have denied infant-bapti&s;m: &s;o that this &s;ect
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cro&s;by, ut &s;upra, p. 109.</NOTE> had the honour both of leading the way, and bringing up the rear of all the martyrs, who were burnt alive in England, as well as that a great number of tho&s;e who &s;uffered this death for their religion, in the 200 years between, were of this denomination. In 1620, &s;everal Anabapti&s;ts tran&s;ported them&s;elves into New England, where for a time they met with but hard mea&s;ure from their con|gregational brethren, who, tho' they had fled from per|&s;ecution them&s;elves, yet could give no great latitude to the tender con&s;ciences of the Bapti&s;ts and Quakers. Dr. Mather, in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, has indeed acknowledged many of the Bapti&s;ts to be worthy and hone&s;t men; and that Mr. Williams, one of their preach|ers, being bani&s;hed from Salem, &s;ettled at a place called Providence, where he gathered a church together, and was very in&s;trumental in obtaining a charter for the government of Rhode I&s;land, of which he was &s;ome|times cho&s;en governor, and that he did all in his power to convert the Indians in his neighbourhood; of the man|ners,
<PB N="198" REF="205">language and tempers of whom, he publi&s;hed a relation. When they were re&s;tored to a peaceable &s;tate, the Bapti&s;ts &s;pread greatly in the colonies of New England, increa&s;ed much in Pen&s;ilvania, where they had, in 1714, nine churches, and there are now Bap|ti&s;t churches in many other colonies in the Briti&s;h A|merica. But to return home:</P>
<P>In 1616, the more moderate Bapti&s;ts publi&s;hed a &s;mall treati&s;e, wherein they endeavoured to ju&s;tify their &s;eparation from the church of England, and to prove that every man has a right to judge for him&s;elf in mat|ters of religion; and that to per&s;ecute any on that ac|count, is illegal and antichri&s;tian, contrary to the laws of God, as well as to &s;everal declarations of the King's Maje&s;ty. They al&s;o a&s;&s;ert their opinion concerning bapti&s;m, and &s;hew the invalidity of the bapti&s;m which was admini&s;tered, either in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, or among the other Di&s;&s;enters; and clear them&s;elves of &s;everal errors unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon them. It appears to be written, or approved of, by the whole body of Bap|ti&s;ts who then remained in England. They &s;ub&s;cribe them&s;elves Chri&s;t's unworthy mini&s;ters, and his Ma|je&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects, commonly called Anabap|ti&s;ts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, from this treati&s;e, inform my readers what were, in general, the opinions of this denomination at this period. They acknowledge magi&s;tracy to be God's ordinance; and that Kings, and &s;uch as are in autho|rity, ought to be obeyed in all civil matters, <HI>not only for fear, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> They allow the ta|king of an oath to be lawful; and declare that all their profe&s;&s;ion were willing, in faithfulne&s;s and truth, to &s;ub&s;cribe the oath of allegiance. They prote&s;t again&s;t the doctrine of the Papi&s;ts, that princes excommuni|cated by the Pope may be depo&s;ed or murdered by their &s;ubjects: calling it a damnable and accur&s;ed doctrine, which their &s;ouls abhor; and al&s;o again&s;t the errors of the Famili&s;ts, who, to avoid per&s;ecution, can comply with
<PB N="199" REF="206">any external form of religion. They confe&s;s that Chri&s;t took his fle&s;h of the virgin Mary; and, for their or|thodoxy in the&s;e and other points, refer the reader to their confe&s;&s;ion of faith, publi&s;hed in 1611. They ac|knowledged that many called Anabapti&s;ts held &s;everal &s;trange opinions contrary to them; but lament it, and clear them&s;elves from de&s;erving any cen&s;ure upon that account, by &s;hewing that it was &s;o in the primitive church, and yet Chri&s;t did not condemn all for the er|rors of &s;ome. But that which they chiefly inveigh a|gain&s;t, is the pride, luxury, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Lords Bi&s;hops, or pretended &s;piritual power, whereby they were expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips and cruel per&s;ecutions. Having in their preface mentioned that text, <HI>The Kings of the earth &s;hall give their power unto the bea&s;t;</HI> "If it be granted (&s;ay they) that the Kings of this nation formerly have given their power to the Romi&s;h bea&s;t, it &s;hall evidently appear that our Lord the King, and all magi&s;trates under him, do give their power unto the &s;ame bea&s;t, tho' the bea&s;t be in another &s;hape."&mdash;"Our mo&s;t humble de&s;ire of our Lord the King is, that he would not give his power to force his faithful-&s;ubjects to di&s;&s;emble, to believe as he believes, in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure of per&s;ecution; tho' it is no &s;mall per&s;ecution to lie many years in filthy pri&s;ons, in hunger, cold, idlene&s;s, divided from wi&s;e, family, calling, left in continual mi&s;eries and temptations, &s;o as death would be to many le&s;s per&s;ecution." Again, &s;hewing how near the pre|latical power and u&s;urpation came to the bloody &s;piri|tual power of the Roman Catholics, they &s;ay, "How many, only for &s;eeking reformation, have been put to death by your power, in the days of Queen Eliza|beth? and how many, both then and &s;ince, have been con&s;umed to death, in pri&s;ons? Yea, &s;ince that &s;pi|ritual power hath been &s;et up, hath not hanging, burn|ing, exile, impri&s;onments, and all manner of contempts, been u&s;ed, and all for religion, altho' &s;ome, for grie|vous errors, and yet you &s;ee not this to be a bloody
<PB N="200" REF="207">rellgion!" &mdash; "Let (they &s;ay in another place) Mr. Fox, or any others who have de&s;cribed the &s;piritual power of Rome, let but their de&s;cription thereof be compared with the &s;piritual power, in all their laws, courts, titles, pomp, pride, and cruelty, and you &s;hall &s;ee them very little differ, except in their <HI>cruelties,</HI> which, glory be to God, the King's Maje&s;ty, who thir&s;teth not after blood, hath &s;omewhat re&s;trained. Altho' it is mo&s;t grievous cruelty to lie divers years in mo&s;t noi&s;ome and filthy pri&s;ons, and continual tempta|tions of want, their e&s;tates overthrown, and never co|ming out, many of them, till death; let it be well weighed, and it is little inferior to the cruel &s;udden death in times of the Romi&s;h power in this nation." After all, they conclude with an hearty prayer for their enemies, "That the Lord would give them repentance; that their &s;ins may not be laid to their charge, even for Chri&s;t's &s;ake."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this declaration, their &s;ufferings were rather increa&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened. They were not on|ly harra&s;&s;ed in the &s;piritual courts, but the temporal &s;word was u&s;ed again&s;t them; their goods &s;eized, their per&s;ons confined, for many years, in &s;tinking goals, where they were deprived of their wives, children and friends, till God was plea&s;ed to relea&s;e numbers of them by death.</P>
<P>Many other attempts they made in the reign of James, to obtain a toleration, but without effect; yet they daily gained ground. In that of Charles the Fir&s;t, they &s;uffered with the re&s;t of the Puritans &s;till great|er per&s;ecutions; and in the year 1633, the Bapti&s;ts be|gan to &s;eparate them&s;elves from the Puritans, and to form &s;ocieties di&s;tinct and apart of tho&s;e of their own per&s;ua&s;ion. In 1642, was a di&s;pute between the fa|mous Dr. Featley and four Anabapti&s;ts, in Southwark; an account of which the Doctor publi&s;hed, tho' a very doubtful and partial one; in the dedication to which he &s;ays, that "he could hardly dip his pen in any thing

<P>What greatly contributed to the increa&s;e of Antipoe|dobapti&s;m in the&s;e times was, that &s;ome of the great|e&s;t writers for reformation &s;poke favourably of that opinion, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of granting liberty to tho&s;e who held it; &s;uch were Robert Lord Brooke, Mr. Daniel Rogers, Bi&s;hop Taylor, and Dr. Ham|mond. In 1043, the Bapti&s;ts publi&s;hed their confe&s;|&s;ion of faith, of which &s;everal editions were printed in 1644 and 1646, one of which was licen&s;ed by autho|rity, and dedicated to the parliament. Their very ad|ver&s;aries were obliged to own this confe&s;&s;ion was, in general, orthodox, and could object very little again&s;t it, except the denial of infant-bapti&s;m, and making immer&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to the right admini&s;tration of that ordinance. However, they were now per&s;ecuted by the intolerant Pre&s;byterians, as they had before been by the rigid Epi&s;copalians: but, in March 1647, a declaration of the Lords and Commons was publi&s;hed in their favour, induced thereto by the great numbers of them then in the army, and in mo&s;t corporations of England. It had the following words:</P>
<P>"The name of Anabapti&s;m hath, indeed, con|tracted much odium, by rea&s;on of the extravagant principles and practices of &s;ome of that name in Ger|many, tending to the di&s;turbance of the government and peace of all &s;tates; which opinions and practices we abhor and dete&s;t: but for their opinion again&s;t the bapti&s;m of infants, it is only a difference about a cir|cum&s;tance of time in the admini&s;tration of an ordi|nance, wherein, in former ages, as well as this, learn|ed men have differed both in opinion and practice. And though we could wi&s;h that all men would &s;atisfy them&s;elves, and join with us in our judgment and prac|tice
<PB N="202" REF="209">in this point; yet herein we hold it fit that men &s;hould be convinced by the word of God, with great gentlene&s;s and rea&s;on, and not beaten out of it with force and violence, &amp;c." It &s;hould &s;eem, however, this Chri&s;tian temper in the parliament was but of &s;hort duration; for, in 1648, they publi&s;hed a cruel ordi|nance <HI>for the puni&s;hing of bla&s;phemies and here&s;ies,</HI> by which every &s;ect but the rigid Pre&s;byterians were con|demned: and upon this ordinance &s;everal Bapti&s;ts were pro&s;ecuted for denying the validity of infant-bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The &s;hort re&s;t they enjoyed towards the clo&s;e of the u&s;urped government had a period by the re&s;toration of King Charles II. in which they concurred with &s;ince|rity, from whom (or rather his mini&s;ters and clergy) they &s;oon experienced equal hard&s;hips with other Di&s;|&s;enters, and were per&s;ecuted in all parts of the king|dom, with impri&s;onment, lo&s;s of goods, &amp;c. &amp;c. Upon Venner's in&s;urrection, they publi&s;hed two apo|logies, wherein they prote&s;ted again&s;t the principles and practices of him and his adherents; and it is cer|tain there were no Bapti&s;ts among&s;t them. Neverthe|le&s;s, the per&s;ecution of them was not cea&s;ed, and, if po&s;&s;ible, they &s;till met with harder mea&s;ure than be|&s;ore, &s;o that, in about eighteen weeks only, many, up|on account of that in&s;urrection, were kept clo&s;e pri|&s;oners. Above four hundred were crowded into New|gate, be&s;ides what were in other pri&s;ons; but at the coronation an act of indemnity being granted to all of|fenders, &s;ave murderers, they were all &s;et at liberty. Yet in vain were all their petitions and remon&s;trances, in vain the many &s;en&s;ible vindications they publi&s;hed of their principles and practices: they were every where, in this reign, loaded with fines, hard&s;hips, re|proach, and abu&s;e. About the year 1676, the Bap|ti&s;ts had &s;everal di&s;putes with the Quakers, which ended to their advantage. In 1677, they publi&s;hed "A confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, put forth by the elders and brethren of many congregations of Chri&s;tians bap|ti&s;ed
<PB N="203" REF="210">upon profe&s;&s;ion of their faith, in London and the country."</P>
<P>To &s;urvey the &s;ufferings of the pious and worthy per&s;ons who encountered all perils for the &s;ake of a good con&s;cience, among&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, though it would draw tears from the &s;ympathetic eye, yet mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, in&s;pire the reader with the &s;ame holy confidence and re&s;olution they in general exerted, un|der their per&s;ecutions and bonds; and I mu&s;t think their fortitude proceeded from the &s;ecret influence of a &s;uperior and un&s;een power, which &s;trengthened them in the day of trial.</P>
<P>The Bapti&s;ts &s;uffered &s;everely in the reign of James II. till his declaration for liberty of con&s;cience relieved them and their per&s;ecuted brethren of the other deno|minations of Di&s;&s;enters. At length the glorious Re|volution, and the con&s;equent toleration of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, re&s;tored them to the public profe&s;&s;ion of their principles. "The face of things being thus changed, it pre&s;ently appeared how ineffectual tho&s;e cruel and barbarous methods, fines, impri&s;onments, &amp;c. were to &s;top the growth and increa&s;e of the Eng|li&s;h Bapti&s;ts: for, &s;oon after, it appeared by the nar|rative of the proceedings of a general a&s;&s;embly, there were more than one hundred congregations of them a&s;&s;embled together, to con&s;ult of proper ways and means to advance the glory of God, and the well being of their churches. A general fa&s;t was ordered by this a&s;&s;embly to be kept by all the congregations, and the cau&s;es and rea&s;ons thereof &s;ent to all the churches." "At this general a&s;&s;embly, which was every day o|pened and concluded with &s;olemn prayer, were pre&s;ent upwards of one hundred and fifty per&s;ons; and &s;o united were their hearts in the &s;pirit of love and &s;weet concord, that, in their debates, con&s;ultations, and re|&s;olves, they &s;ay, <HI>&s;carcely one brother di&s;&s;ented from the a&s;&s;embly in the &s;entiments of his mind, in any one thing pro|po&s;ed to their &s;erious con&s;ideration.</HI> This general a&s;&s;em|bly,
<PB N="204" REF="211">Sept. 5. con&s;idered and concluded that a public fund or &s;tock was nece&s;&s;ary towards maintaining and &s;upporting a regular mini&s;try, and came to a re&s;olu|tion how to rai&s;e it; and unanimou&s;ly concluded that it &s;hould be rai&s;ed by a <HI>free-will offering;</HI> that every per&s;on &s;hould communicate according to his ability, and as the Lord &s;hall make him willing, and enlarge his heart; and that the churches &s;everally among them|&s;elves do order the collection of it with all convenient &s;peed, that the ends propo&s;ed may be put into pre&s;ent practice.</P>
<P>The u&s;es to which this fund was to be applied were, 1. To communicate thereof to tho&s;e churches that are not able to maintain their own mini&s;try; and that their mini&s;ters may be encouraged wholly to devote them|&s;elves to the great work of preaching the go&s;pel. 2. To &s;end mini&s;ters that are ordained, or at lea&s;t &s;olemnly called, to preach both in city and country, where the go&s;pel hath or hath not been preached, and to vi&s;it the churches; and the&s;e to be cho&s;en out of the churches in London, or the country; which mini&s;ters are to be approved of, and &s;ent forth by two churches at the lea&s;t; but more, if it may be. 3.

<P>The Bapti&s;ts hi&s;tory from this happy aera of the act of toleration is not &s;uch as to come within the compa&s;s of my propo&s;ed plan. I have brought them to the &s;afe enjoyment of their religious liberties: &s;ince that was afforded to them, by the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, their hi&s;tory, to the pre&s;ent day, can con&s;i&s;t of little but acts of internal di&s;cipline, the meetings and acts of their a&s;&s;emblies, and a few controver&s;ies which have agitated them relating to the doctrine of the Trinity, p&s;alm|&s;inging, &amp;c. &amp;c. They have dutifully, with the other
<PB N="205" REF="212">denominations, addre&s;&s;ed the throne upon all intere&s;t|ing public occa&s;ions, and have been concerned with them in the &s;everal applications for the repeal of the corporation and te&s;t acts.</P>
<P>As the Bapti&s;ts are divided into two bodies, called <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular,</HI> before I lay before my readers their &s;entiments in point of doctrine, I &s;hall give an ac|count of their method of performing the rite of bap|ti&s;m, in which they are all agreed, with very little va|riation; particularly as it is that peculiar practice by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>It will be proper to premi&s;e, that the per&s;on to be bapti&s;ed is previou&s;ly in&s;tructed in the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, of the nature of bapti&s;m, the de|&s;ign, pre-requi&s;ite qualifications, the manner in which it ought to be admini&s;tered, and the advantages re|&s;ulting from it; that from a per&s;ua&s;ion of its being then his duty, he may voluntarily offer and de&s;ire to be bapti&s;ed. The mini&s;ter then, with &s;ome of that &s;ociety, conver&s;e with him or her; after which, at the time and place appointed, which is u&s;ually the next Sabbath-day, &s;ometimes after the morning-&s;ervice, at other times after the afternoon-&s;ervice, and at other times on &s;ome other day of the week, the rite is per|formed, when there is u&s;ually a &s;ermon &s;uitable to that occa&s;ion; and the mini&s;ter u&s;es a &s;hort addre&s;s to the per&s;on to be bapti&s;ed, to the following purpo&s;e.</P>
<Q>In pre&s;enting your&s;elf before God, and the&s;e witne&s;&s;es and members of his church, to be bapti&s;ed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and into the profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian religion, we pre&s;ume, in charity, and have good rea|&s;on to believe you are determined by the clear and &s;trong &s;en&s;e of your duty, and with &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as your own con&s;cience approves, &s;uch as are acceptable to God, and, thro' his ble&s;&s;ing upon your faithful en|deavours, will terminate in the improvement and hap|pine&s;s of your &s;oul, &amp;c.</Q>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">Then the mini&s;ter enlarges on the grounds and au|thority of Chri&s;t's in&s;tituting the ordinance of bapti&s;m: unle&s;s a &s;ermon is preached on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter proceeds to explain what is properly to be under&s;tood by being bapti&s;ed into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t &mdash;He likewi&s;e enlarges on the moral u&s;e and influence of bapti&s;m,&mdash;on the qualifications demanded in &s;cripture, of all per&s;ons to whom Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is to be admini&s;tered, as that which can ju&s;tify a mini&s;ter therein, and in vindication of this mode of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Then the mini&s;ter, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the per&s;on, a&s;ks him the&s;e que&s;tions:</P>
<P><HI>Mini&s;ter.</HI> Will you declare in the church and pre&s;ence of God, who cannot be deceived, and will not be mocked, that you believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God.</P>
<P><HI>Mini&s;.</HI> Is it your affectionate reverence for the autho|rity and in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that induces you at this time to offer your&s;elf to be bapti&s;ed into the profe&s;|&s;ion of his holy name and religion?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Mini&s;.</HI> Are you re&s;olved to renounce every known and pre&s;umptuous &s;in, to obey the precepts, and follow the example of your Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in an humble dependance upon God, to adorn the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity you this day put on, by main|taining to the end of your life a conver&s;ation becoming the go&s;pel?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Then, in &s;ome congregations, they &s;ing a p&s;alm or hymn adapted to the occa&s;ion, and then pray; at others they proceed to prayer without &s;inging; the matter and form of which, as recommended in Harri&s;on's Of|fice of Bapti&s;m, printed in 1759, and given as a &s;pe|cimen,
<PB N="207" REF="214">appears to be well adapted; but I mu&s;t refer the curious to the book it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter then withdraws to dre&s;s him&s;elf for the admini&s;tration, as do the per&s;ons to be bapti&s;ed; for they have proper dre&s;&s;es for men and women, and dif|ferent apartments, with proper attendants on each. In the time of intermi&s;&s;ion another mini&s;ter or deacon ge|nerally reads <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxvi. cxviii. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iii. <HI>Acts</HI> viii. <HI>Romans</HI> vi. or &s;ome other parts of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Upon the mini&s;ter's, &amp;c. return to the bapti&s;try (which at Barbican
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near Adler&s;age &s;treet.</NOTE> is admirably commodious), the mini&s;ter addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the per&s;on to be bapti&s;ed, &s;ays, "In con&s;equence of your voluntary, public, and &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of your Chri&s;tian faith, penitence, and holy re&s;olutions, it becomes my duty to bapti&s;e you:" then, taking the per&s;on by the hand, they go down together into the water, u&s;ing the&s;e or &s;uch like phra&s;es: <HI>They went down into the water, Philip with the eunuch, and he bapti&s;ed him.&mdash;Who &s;hall forbid wa|ter that the&s;e &s;hould not be bapti&s;ed, who have made a good profe&s;&s;ion before many witne&s;&s;es?</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes, where the former addre&s;s to the per&s;on has been omitted, the mini&s;ter &s;ays, immediately before the bapti&s;m, "As thou ha&s;t profe&s;&s;ed thy faith in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and de&s;ire&s;t to be bapti&s;ed, I bapti&s;e thee in his name." At other times only the &s;cripture form is u&s;ed, <HI>I bapti&s;e thee, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> At coming up out of the water, &s;ome &s;ignificant phra&s;e is u&s;ually made u&s;e of, as&mdash;<HI>We are buried with him by bapti&s;m.&mdash;Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then the mini&s;ter and the bapti&s;ed retire, and &s;ome other mini&s;ter generally concludes with &s;inging a p&s;alm or hymn, and then prayer. The per&s;on thus bapti&s;ed is deemed a member of the &s;ociety, and con&s;equently has a right to partake of the Lord's &s;upper, in that church, or any other of the &s;ame denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215">But here, in many congregations, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, they practi&s;e laying on of hands of the mini&s;ter on the party bapti&s;ed, with prayer, before their admi&s;&s;ion to communion.

<P>The two parties of Bapti&s;ts in England, which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince their fir&s;t appearance as a &s;ect, are, the <HI>particular Bapti&s;ts,</HI> viz. tho&s;e that have followed the doctrines of Calvin, and from the princi|pal point thereof, <HI>per&s;onal election,</HI> are &s;o called

<P>The chief heads of belief and doctrine of the <HI>parti|cular Bapti&s;ts</HI> I mu&s;t draw from the various confe&s;&s;ions of their faith which have appeared in the world, from time to time, which vary little from each other, no|ting afterwards in what &s;ome of the pre&s;ent particular Bapti&s;ts differ. This I &s;hall be obliged to do as brief|ly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>They believe in one God, who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is in him&s;elf, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence cannot be comprehended by any
<PB N="209" REF="216">but him&s;elf; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto; who is in him&s;elf mo&s;t holy, every way infinite, in greatne&s;s, power, wi&s;dom, love; merciful and gracious, long|&s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth; who giveth being, moving, and pre&s;ervation to all crea|tures: that in God there is the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; yet one God: that God hath decreed concerning all things, before the world was created, whether nece&s;&s;ary, accidental, or voluntary; yet with|out being the author of &s;in: that he hath pre-ordained &s;ome men to eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the prai&s;e and glory of his grace; leaving the re&s;t in their &s;in, to their ju&s;t condemnation, to the prai&s;e of his ju&s;tice: that God made all things good; but, by A|dam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, death came upon all his po&s;terity, who now are conceived in &s;in, and by nature the chil|dren of wrath, the &s;ubject of death, and every mi&s;ery in this world, and for ever, unle&s;s Chri&s;t &s;et them free: that neither good or evil befal any by chance, or with|out God's Providence; and that what&s;oever befals the elect is by his appointment, for his glory and their good: that all the elect are redeemed, not by them|&s;elves, nor their own works, but only by the free grace and mercy of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: that the &s;criptures are the only rule for holine&s;s and obedience: that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, by whom he made and upholdeth the world; that he was begat by the Holy Gho&s;t, born of the Virgin Mary, was tempted as we are, yet without &s;in: that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Mediator, and Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King of the church of God, for ever: that he was appointed by God unto this office from everla&s;ting; and in re&s;pect of his man|hood, from the womb called, &s;eparated, and anoint|ed, mo&s;t fully and abundantly with all gifts nece&s;&s;ary, God having without mea&s;ure poured out his &s;pirit up|on him: that he is, by the &s;pecial promi&s;e of God, ordained to the office of Mediator; which promi&s;e is,

<HEAD><HI>The Hi&s;tory of the</HI> QUAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of this &s;ect or brotherhood &s;hould be drawn with a very impartial pen: they have, from their differing not only in the fundamentals, but in dre&s;s and form of &s;peech, from other Chri&s;tians (if I may be permitted to call them &s;o), been &s;ubject to the mo&s;t low and illiberal abu&s;e. The writers of o|ther &s;entiments have &s;tored up &s;o many calumnies and fal&s;ehoods, when they have had occa&s;ion to mention them, that it is a difficult ta&s;k to &s;eparate fiction from fact. Therefore, as my intent is to afford impartial ju&s;tice to my &s;ubject, I think I cannot better do &s;o than by recurring to their own writers, not only for their hi&s;tory, but for an account of their doctrine and di&s;|cipline.</P>
<P>The appellative QUAKERS was be&s;towed upon them as a name of reproach and contempt, taken from the &s;trugglings and agitations vi&s;ible in their &s;peakers or preachers, when under tho&s;e influences they e&s;teemed divine.

He was brought up to hu&s;bandry, and other country-bu&s;ine&s;s, and was particularly inclined to the &s;olitary occupation of a &s;hepherd; "an employ|ment," &s;ays my author, "that very well &s;uited his mind in &s;everal re&s;pects, both for its innocency and &s;o|litude; and was a ju&s;t emblem of his after mini&s;try and &s;ervice." In the year 1646, he entirely for&s;ook the national church, in who&s;e tenets he had been brought up, as before ob&s;erved; and in 1647 he tra|velled into Derby&s;hire and Nottingham&s;hire, without any &s;et purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting particular places, but in a &s;olitary manner he walked through &s;everal towns and villages, which way &s;oever his mind turned. "He fa&s;ted much," &s;ays Sewell, "and walked often in re|tired places, with no other companion but his Bible." "He vi&s;ited the mo&s;t retired and religious people in tho&s;e parts," &s;ays Penn; "and &s;ome there were, &s;hort of few, if any, in this nation, <HI>who waited for the con|&s;olation of I&s;rael night and day;</HI> as Zacharias, Anna, and Simeon, did of old time. To the&s;e he was &s;ent, and the&s;e he &s;ought out in the neighbouring counties, and among them he &s;ojourned till his more ample mi|ni&s;try came upon him. At this time he taught, and was an example of <HI>&s;ilence,</HI> endeavouring to bring them from &s;elf-performances; te&s;tifying of, and turning them to the <HI>light of Chri&s;t within them,</HI> and encoura|ging them to wait in <HI>patience,</HI> and to feel the power of

Accordingly &s;everal meetings were gather|ed in tho&s;e parts; and thus his time was employed for &s;ome years."</P>
<P>In the year 1652, "he had a vi&s;itation of the <HI>great work</HI> of God in the earth, and of the way that he was to go forth, in a public mini&s;try, to begin it." He directed his cour&s;e northward, "and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exerci&s;e and &s;ervice <HI>&s;hewn</HI> to him, &s;o that the Lord was his <HI>leader</HI> indeed." He made great num|bers of converts to his opinions, and many pious and good men joined him in his mini&s;try
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the mo&s;t eminent were, Richard Farn&s;worth, James Naylor, William Dew&s;berry, Thomas Aldam, Francis Howgil, Edward Burroughs, John Camm, John Audland, Richard Hubber|thorne, &amp;c. &amp;c. who were the fir&s;t preachers among&s;t the Quakers.</NOTE>.

But the&s;e co|ercive methods rather forwarded than abated their zeal, and in tho&s;e parts they brought over many pro&s;elytes, and among&s;t them &s;everal magi&s;trates, and others of the better &s;ort. They apprehended the Lord had for|bid them to pull off their hats to any one, high or low, and required them to &s;peak to the people, with|out di&s;tinction, in the language of <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee.</HI> They &s;crupled bidding people good-morrow, or good-night; nor might they bend the knee to any one, even in &s;u|preme authority. Both men and women went in a plain and &s;imple dre&s;s, different from the fa&s;hion of the times. They neither gave nor accepted any titles of re&s;pect or honour, nor would they call any man ma&s;ter, on earth. Several texts of &s;cripture they quo|ted in defence of the&s;e &s;ingularities; &s;uch as, <HI>Swear not at all.&mdash;How can ye believe who receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not the honour which comes from God only?</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. They placed the ba&s;is of religion in an inward light, and an extraordinary impul&s;e of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>In 1654, their fir&s;t &s;eparate meeting in London was held in the hou&s;e of Robert Dring, in Watling &s;treet, (for by that time they had &s;pread them&s;elves into all parts of the kingdom, and had in many places &s;et up meetings or a&s;&s;emblies, particularly in Lanca&s;hire and the adjacent parts) but they were &s;till expo&s;ed to great per&s;ecutions and trials of every kind. One of them, in a letter to the Protector, Oliver Cromwell, repre&s;ents, "That tho' there are no penal laws in force obliging men to comply with the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, yet the Quakers are expo&s;ed upon other accounts; they are fined and impri&s;oned for refu&s;ing to take an oath; for

<P>Under favour of the then toleration they opened their meeting at the Bull and Mouth inn, in Alder&s;gate &s;treet, where women as well as men were moved to &s;peak. Their zeal tran&s;ported them to &s;ome extra|vagances, which laid them &s;till more open to the la&s;h of their enemies, who exerci&s;ed various &s;everities upon them throughout the next reign.

<P>And this con&s;ider, we are about four hundred im|pri&s;oned, in and about this city, of men and women from their families, be&s;ides, in the county goals, about ten hundred, we de&s;ire that our meetings may not be broken up, but that all may come to a fair trial, that our innocency may be cleared up &mdash;.</P>

<P><PB N="235" REF="242">On the 28th of the &s;ame month they publi&s;hed the declaration referred to in their addre&s;s, intitled, <HI>A de|claration from the harmle&s;s and innocent people of God call|ed Quakers, again&s;t all &s;edition, plotters and fighters in the world, for removing the ground of jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion, from both magi&s;trates and people in the kingdom, concerning wars and fightings.</HI> It was pre&s;ented to the King the 21&s;t day of the eleventh month, 1660, and he pro|mi&s;ed them upon his royal word, that they &s;hould not &s;uffer for their opinions, as long as they lived peacea|bly; but his promi&s;es were very little regarded after|wards.</P>
<P>In 1661, they a&s;&s;umed courage to petition the hou&s;e of Lords for a toleration of their religion, and for a di&s;pen&s;ation from taking the oaths, which they held unlawful, not from any di&s;affection to the govern|ment, or a belief that they were le&s;s obliged by an af|firmation, but from a per&s;ua&s;ion that all oaths were un|lawful; and that &s;wearing upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa|&s;ions was forbidden in the New Te&s;tament. Their petition was rejected, and in&s;tead of granting them relief, an act was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them, the preamble to which &s;et forth, "That whereas &s;everal per&s;ons have taken up an opinion, that an oath, even before a magi&s;trate, is un|lawful, and contrary to the word of God; and where|as, under pretence of religious wor&s;hip, the &s;aid per&s;ons do a&s;&s;emble in great numbers in &s;everal parts of the kingdom, &s;eparating them&s;elves from the re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and the public congregations and u&s;ual places of divine wor&s;hip:" be it therefore en|acted, That if any &s;uch per&s;ons, after the 24th of March 1661-2, &s;hall refu&s;e to take an oath when law|fully tendered, or per&s;uade others to do it, or main|tain in writing, or otherwi&s;e, the unlawfulne&s;s of taking an oath; or if they &s;hall a&s;&s;emble for religious wor&s;hip to the number of five or more, of the age of fifteen, they &s;hall for the fir&s;t offence forfeit five pounds; for the &s;econd, ten pounds; and for the third &s;hall abjure
<PB N="236" REF="243">the realm, or be tran&s;ported to the plantations: and the ju&s;tices of peace at their open &s;e&s;&s;ions may hear and finally determine in the affair."</P>
<P>This act had a mo&s;t dreadful effect upon the Qua|kers, tho' it was well known and notorious the&s;e con|&s;cientious per&s;ons were far from &s;edition or di&s;affection to the government. George Fox, in his addre&s;s to the King, acquaints him, that three thou&s;and and &s;ixty|eight of their friends had been impri&s;oned &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's re&s;toration; that their meetings were daily broken up by men with clubs and arms, and their friends thrown into the water, and trampled under foot, till the blood gu&s;hed out, which gave ri&s;e to their meeting in the open &s;treets. A relation was printed, &s;igned by twelve witne&s;&s;es, which &s;ays, that more than four thou&s;and two hundred Quakers were impri&s;oned; and of them five hundred were in and about London, and the &s;uburbs; &s;everal of whom were dead in the goals.</P>
<P>However, they even gloried in their &s;ufferings, which increa&s;ed every day; &s;o that in 1665, and the inter|mediate years, they were harra&s;&s;ed without example. As they per&s;i&s;ted re&s;olutely to a&s;&s;emble, openly, at the Bull and Mouth, before-mentioned, the &s;oldiers, and other officers, dragged them from thence to pri&s;on, till Newgate was filled with them, and multitudes died of clo&s;e confinement, in that and other goals.</P>
<P>Six hundred of them, &s;ays an account publi&s;hed at this time, were in pri&s;on, merely <HI>for religion-&s;ake,</HI> of whom &s;everal were bani&s;hed to the plantations. "In &s;hort (&s;ays Mr. Neale) the Quakers gave &s;uch full em|ployment to the informers, that they had le&s;s lei&s;ure to attend the meetings of other Di&s;&s;enters."</P>

<PB N="242" REF="249">that Chri&s;t's body that was crucified, was not the God|head; yet, by the power of God, was rai&s;ed from the dead, changed into a more glorious condition, and a&s;cended into heaven and glory. True and living faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Son of the living God, re&s;pects his being and fulne&s;s, and al&s;o his making him&s;elf known in the &s;oul in every degree of his light, life, &s;pirit, grace and truth, the immediate cau&s;e, author, object, and &s;trength of our living faith, &amp;c. Which light and life of the Son of God, within, truly obeyed and followed, will bring us to the adoption of &s;ons. It is true, we are not to undervalue the holy &s;criptures, nor &s;light the preaching of the word, as being outward helps and in|&s;truments in the hand of God for the conver&s;ion of &s;in|ners: nor do we &s;et them in oppo&s;ition to the light or &s;pirit of God or Chri&s;t within; for his faithful me&s;&s;en|gers are mini&s;ters thereof, to turn people to the &s;ame light and &s;pirit in them.</P>
<P>It is certain that great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s in it&s;elf: that God &s;hould be manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, &amp;c. &mdash;and it is a great and precious my&s;tery of godline&s;s and Chri&s;tianity, that Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;piritually and effectually manife&s;ted in mens hearts:&mdash;Chri&s;t is re|vealed in every true believer, freeing them from the bondage of &s;in, as their wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ancti|fication, and redemption. This my&s;tery of godline&s;s in its own being and glory (in many hid, and in &s;ome revealed) hath been, and mu&s;t be te&s;tified, preached, and believed, where God is plea&s;ed to give commi&s;&s;ion, and prepare peoples hearts for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As touching <HI>the re&s;urrection of the dead,</HI> we believe, as the &s;cripture te&s;tifies, that <HI>if in this life only we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable:</HI> that the &s;oul or &s;pirit of every man and woman &s;hall be re&s;erved in its own di&s;tinct and proper being (&s;o as there &s;hall be as many &s;ouls in the world to come as in this) and every &s;eed (yea every &s;oul: &s;hall have its proper body, as God is plea&s;ed to give it. <HI>A natural body is &s;own, a
<PB N="243" REF="250">&s;piritual body is rai&s;ed;</HI> and, tho' <HI>this corruptible &s;hall put on incorruption, and this mortal &s;hall put on immortality,</HI> the change &s;hall be &s;uch, as <HI>fle&s;h and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;</HI> &s;o we expect our &s;piritual bodies, in the re&s;urrection, &s;hall far excel what our bodies now are; but how the dead are rai&s;ed, or <HI>with what body they come,</HI> we &s;ubmit to the wi&s;dom and plea&s;ure of Al|mighty God, for we cannot pre&s;ume to determine.</P>
<P>As to the doctrine of the eternal judgment, we be|live that God hath committed all judgment unto the Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and he is both judge of quick and dead, and of the &s;tates and ends of all mankind. That this Son of man, who hath &s;o deeply &s;uffered, and en|dured &s;o great indignities, &s;hall, in the la&s;t and great day, manife&s;tly appear in glory, attended with all his glorious heavenly ho&s;t and retinue, to the terror and amazement of tho&s;e who have denied him; but to the glory and triumph of the righteous, the faithful fol|lowers and friends of Chri&s;t. It is a righteous thing with God, that they who &s;uffer with him &s;hould ap|pear with him in glory and dignity, when he &s;hall ap|pear at la&s;t judge of the world and prince thereof:&mdash; whil&s;t tho&s;e who now evade and reject the inward con|victions and judgment of the light, and &s;hut up the records or books thereof in their own con&s;cience, they &s;hall be at la&s;t opened, and every one judged of the&s;e things recorded therein, according to their works.</P>

<P>I.

<P>As for the word Sacrament, we do not read of it in the &s;cripture; but as for the body and blood of Chri&s;t, I own, and that there is no remi&s;&s;ion without blood: we do believe, according as it is written, that Chri&s;t, at his la&s;t &s;upper, took bread and brake it, and gave it to his di&s;ciples, and al&s;o took the cup and ble&s;&s;ed it, and &s;aid unto them, <HI>and as often as ye do this, you &s;hew forth the Lord's death till he come;</HI> and this we believe they did, and did eat their bread in &s;inglene&s;s of heart: but when Chri&s;t came again to them, according to his promi&s;e, they &s;aid, we being many are one bread, for we are all partakers of this one bread; for there is a difference between that bread which he brake at his la&s;t

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his ma&s;terly and &s;hrewd Apology.</NOTE> endeavours to prove this propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> "As there is one Lord and one faith, &s;o there is one bapti&s;m, which is not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience before God, by the re|&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

As to the bapti&s;m of infants, it is a mere human tradition, for which neither precept nor practice is to be found in all the &s;cripture." Concerning the Lord's &s;upper, he advances in his 13th propo&s;ition, "that the communion of the body and blood of Chri&s;t is inward and &s;piritual, which is the participation of his fle&s;h and blood, by which the infant man is daily nouri&s;hed in the hearts of tho&s;e in whom Chri&s;t dwells; of which things the breaking of bread by Chri&s;t with his di&s;ciples was a figure, which they even u&s;ed in the church for a time, who had received the &s;ub&s;tance, for the cau&s;e of the weak; even as <HI>ab&s;taining from things &s;trangled, and from blood;</HI> the <HI>wa&s;hing one another's feet,</HI> and the <HI>anoint|ing of the &s;ick with oil;</HI> all which are commanded with no le&s;s authority and &s;olemnity than the former; yet &s;eeing they are but the &s;hadows of better things, they cea&s;e in &s;uch as have obtained the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI>" It is not

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> CHURCH DISCIPLINE <HI>and</HI> GOVERNMENT <HI>of the People called</HI> QUAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>"IN the year 1667, I was moved (&s;ays George Fox
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Journal.</NOTE>) to recommend the &s;etting up of monthly meet|ings throughout the nation, friends hitherto having only had their general quarterly meetings
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the beginning (&s;ays Dr. Rutty) the bu&s;ine&s;s now properly belonging to the monthly meetings, was tran&s;acted at the quarterly meetings, where a larger body of friends being a&s;&s;embled, was more nece&s;&s;ary for mutual help and advice, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e times of &s;uffering and weakne&s;s.</NOTE>; and the Lord opened unto me, and let me &s;ee what I mu&s;t do, and how mens and womens monthly and quarterly meetings &s;hould be ordered and e&s;tabli&s;hed in England and other nations; and that I &s;hould write to them, where I came not, to do the &s;ame. Accordingly, having recommended the &s;etting up of five monthly meetings in the city of London, to take care of God's glory, and to admoni&s;h and exhort &s;uch as walked di&s;|orderly, and not according to truth; then I pa&s;&s;ed forth into the counties again, and advi&s;ed that month|ly meetings &s;hould be &s;ettled there al&s;o, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, which was done according to the go&s;pel|order, in and by the power of God, the authority of our meetings being the power of God; and in the year 1668, I writ to Ireland and to Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and other parts of America, advi&s;ing friends to &s;ettle their monthly meetings in tho&s;e coun|tries
<PB N="247" REF="254">al&s;o, which was accordingly done
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He afterwards vi&s;ited tho&s;e countries in per&s;on, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in the e&s;tabli&s;hing of tho&s;e meetings.</NOTE>; and, in|deed, the good effects of the &s;ettlement of tho&s;e meet|ings &s;oon appeared."&mdash;"They did make a great refor|mation among&s;t people, in&s;omuch that the very ju&s;tices took notice of the u&s;efulne&s;s and &s;ervice thereof; and &s;everal who had run out were brought to condemn what they had done ami&s;s, and through repentance came in again; and many have ble&s;&s;ed the Lord God that ever he did &s;end me forth in this &s;ervice, now all coming to have a concern and care for God's honour and glory, that his name be not bla&s;phemed, which they do profe&s;s, and to &s;ee that all who profe&s;s the truth do walk in the truth, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s."</P>
<P>Thus were monthly meetings for men and women formed: for their authority in the latter ca&s;e &s;ee <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxv. 25, 26. <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Phil.</HI> iv. 3. <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 3, 4, 5. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. George Fox has thus given us the u&s;e of them, "That the faithful women who were called to the belief of the truth, being made par|takers of the &s;ame precious faith, and heirs of the &s;ame everla&s;ting go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation, might in like manner come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and practice of the go&s;pel-order, and be therein meet-helps to the men in the re&s;toration, in the &s;ervice of the truth, in the affairs of the church, as they are outwardly in civil or tem|poral things, that &s;o the family of God, women as well as men, might know, po&s;&s;e&s;s, perform and di&s;|charge their offices and &s;ervices in the hou&s;e of God, whereby the poor might be the better taken care of, the younger &s;ort in&s;tructed and informed in the way of God, the loo&s;e and di&s;orderly reproved and admo|ni&s;hed in the fear of the Lord, the clearne&s;s of per&s;ons propounding marriage more clo&s;ely and &s;trictly en|quired into, in the wi&s;dom of God; and all the mem|bers
<PB N="248" REF="255">of the &s;piritual body, the church, might watch over and be helpful to one another in love."</P>
<P>"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Penn's Account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the Quakers.</NOTE> The monthly meetings &s;o &s;et up were more or fewer, as the ca&s;e required, in every re&s;pective county, four or &s;ix meetings of wor&s;hip u&s;ually making one meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the&s;e monthly meetings in each county made up one quarterly meeting, where the mo&s;t zealous and eminent friends of the county a&s;&s;embled to communicate, advi&s;e, and help one another, e&s;peci|ally when any bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed difficult, or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter; and the&s;e &s;everal quarterly meetings dige&s;ted the reports of their monthly meetings, and prepared one for each re&s;pec|tive county again&s;t the yearly meeting, in which all quarterly meetings re&s;olve, which is held in London, where the churches in this nation, and other nations and provinces meet, by cho&s;en members of their re|&s;pective counties, both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to advi&s;e and be advi&s;ed in any de|pending ca&s;e to edification. The minutes of the year|ly meeting upon the &s;everal matters that have been un|der con&s;ideration therein, are drawn up (to the end that the re&s;pective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings) together with a gene|ral exhortation to holine&s;s, purity and charity. The&s;e meetings are opened and u&s;ually concluded in their &s;o|lemn waiting upon God; and it is further to be noted, in the&s;e &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies for the church's &s;ervice, there is no one pre&s;ides among them, after the manner of the a&s;&s;emblies of other people; Chri&s;t only being their pre&s;ident, as he is plea&s;ed to appear in life and wi&s;dom in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity and degree, the re&s;t adhere with a firm unity; not of authority, but conviction, which is the divine authority, and way of Chri&s;t's power and &s;pirit in his people, making good his ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;e, that
<PB N="249" REF="256">he would be in the mid&s;t of his, where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world."</P>
<P>"Such, &s;ays Dr. Rutty, was the con&s;titution of the &s;everal meetings for di&s;cipline, and the orderly &s;ubordination of monthly to quarterly, and of the&s;e to the yearly meeting, this la&s;t being the repre&s;entative of the whole body of the people. Thus, if any brother apprehend him&s;elf injured by the determination of a monthly meeting, he hath liberty of appeal from thence to the quarterly, and from this la&s;t, if ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be, to the yearly or national meeting. And monthly meet|ings are &s;o far &s;ubordinate to the quarterly, that at the yearly meeting 1715 it was agreed, that no monthly meeting &s;hall divide it&s;elf into two &s;epa|rate monthly meetings, either by rea&s;on of the de|crea&s;e of love, or any other difference among them in that meeting; nor without the con&s;ent or con|currence of the quarterly meeting. Before I clo&s;e my account of the meetings for di&s;cipline, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that there is al&s;o another meeting which con|venes for the benefit of the whole body, in the inter|vals of the yearly meeting, being a deputation or com|mittee of the yearly meeting, commonly called <HI>The meeting for &s;ufferings,</HI> which holds corre&s;pondence with the &s;everal counties, and even with other nations, in order to &s;olicit for ea&s;e from the government in any ca&s;e of &s;uffering for con&s;cience &s;ake, or to be other|wi&s;e helpful to any of the inferior meetings on any emergency

<P>"The&s;e <HI>vi&s;itors</HI> being appointed by the <HI>monthly</HI> meet|ings, whereof they were members, commonly per|formed their vi&s;it to the &s;everal families within the li|mits of their re&s;pective meetings once a-year, or often|er, as occa&s;ion might require, and returned an ac|count of their labours to the meeting which con&s;tituted them; and when they had performed their vi&s;it, a new nomination of per&s;ons was made for this &s;ervice. The qualifications required in the&s;e men are thus de|&s;cribed, in general terms, in the records of the <HI>nation|al</HI> meeting at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of them, <HI>viz.</HI> "That they &s;hould be ju&s;t in dealings among men, free from worldly incumbrances, and all coming up in their pla|ces to an&s;wer their high and honourable calling, accor|ding to their capacities and abilities." And the general tenor of their commi&s;&s;ion is thus de&s;cribed, "That friends might be cautioned again&s;t running into any exce&s;s or extreme in trading or farming; that they might be kept out of airine&s;s in deportment, and mul|tiplicity of words in bargaining, buying, or &s;elling; and &s;uperfluity in apparel, furniture, or hou&s;ehold|&s;tuff." They were not, however, re&s;tricted to the&s;e particulars only; but, in the cour&s;e of their exerci&s;e in this weighty &s;ervice, were led to many other nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ubjects of coun&s;el and admonition; and indeed the zeal and vigilance of the brethren in Ireland, in this branch of di&s;cipline, was truly memorable; of which I think it well worth while to give a &s;hort &s;pe|cimen from the writings of an experienced elder
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Pike, in an epi&s;tle to the national meeting, publi&s;hed in Dublin, A. D. 1726.</NOTE>, and other records, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t of all, they that were cho&s;en for <HI>vi&s;itors</HI> met together, and after waiting for a time

Such examination being pre|mi&s;ed, they thus proceeded in their vi&s;its. When they came to a family, they &s;at down with them, and fir&s;t waited a while upon the Lord, and then, as it aro&s;e upon the minds of any, advice was given them &s;uitable to their re&s;pective &s;tates and conditions; &s;ometimes to all the family together, and &s;ometimes to particular per&s;ons apart, as they &s;aw occa&s;ion, particularly and principally directing them to the witne&s;s of God, and gift of his Holy Spirit in them&s;elves, as that by which alone they could grow in truth, and witne&s;s their hearts clean&s;ed, which would work an effectual regulation in their outward demeanour; and then they proceeded to the mention of &s;ome in&s;tances of this, as occa&s;ion offered, and recommended to their ob&s;ervation the particular minutes or advices which had been given forth from meetings. But, more particularly, in the&s;e family-vi&s;its, friends were exhorted to diligence in the <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of Almighty God, and a zealous attendance on the meetings appointed for that purpo&s;e, both on the fir&s;t days and on other days of the week; and not on|ly &s;o, but to a fervent exerci&s;e of &s;pirit in tho&s;e meet|ings; and parents, ma&s;ters, and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, were advi&s;ed to encourage their children and &s;ervants in this religious exerci&s;e. They were al&s;o &s;everally ad|vi&s;ed to an&s;wer the high and holy calling of the Lord, in coming up in their &s;ervices in the church, according to the under&s;tanding received, and ability of body and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Next, as to <HI>trading</HI> and <HI>dealing,</HI>&mdash;That none might involve them&s;elves in the cares and incumbrances of the world, &s;o as to be hindered from &s;erving the Lord

<P>The crimes and irregularities which render the Qua|kers liable either to be admoni&s;hed or di&s;owned as bre|thren, are, a neglect of the meetings appointed for the wor&s;hip of God, inju&s;tice and frauds of all kinds, defamation, breach of the marriage-covenant, whore|dom, drunkenne&s;s, gaming, and &s;wearing. But be|&s;ides the above enumerated evils condemned by them, in common with other profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, there were al&s;o certain practices, which &s;eemed to be either le&s;&s;er degrees of tho&s;e evils, or to have a tendency to promote them, or, in the view of this people, to be hurtful to the &s;ouls of men and their &s;piritual pro&s;peri|ty, and incon&s;i&s;tent with that Chri&s;tian te&s;timony God had called them to bear again&s;t the corruptions of the world, which became the &s;ubjects of the church's care to pre&s;erve her members from, <HI>e. g.</HI> the unnece&s;&s;ary frequenting of alehou&s;es or taverns, drinking of healths, &s;uperfluities of provi&s;ions at marriages or burials, the abu&s;e of our precious time in divers exerci&s;es called re|creations; as cock-fighting, hor&s;e-races, and attend|ing play-hou&s;es and mu&s;ic-meetings; al&s;o extravagance
<PB N="255" REF="262">and &s;uperfluity in habit, furniture, &s;peech, and even in trading and farming; all the&s;e were and are deemed proper &s;ubjects of reproof and admonition. There are yet &s;ome other in&s;tances of unfaithfulne&s;s peculiarly cognizable by the church among this people, viz. 1. One brother going to law with another. 2. Fight|ing, whether private or public. 3. The payment of tithes or church-rates, &s;o called, by any of this profe&s;|&s;ion, was always cen&s;ured among this people, as a de|viation from the known &s;en&s;e and judgment of the brethren, with regard to the &s;upport of a Chri&s;tian mi|ni&s;try, and a trampling upon that te&s;timony which they believed God had called them to bear again&s;t this antichri&s;tian yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, and was faithfully maintained by divers of the ancient brethren, by &s;uf|fering impri&s;onment, even unto death, upon this ac|count. A mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this yoke, for fear of &s;uffering, was further condemnable, becau&s;e of its tendency to increa&s;e the &s;ufferings of the faithful, and &s;trengthen the hands of their adver&s;aries. This hath been always deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, that, from the fir&s;t publication of the epi&s;tles from the yearly meeting of London to this pre&s;ent time, accounts are tran&s;mit|ted from thence of the &s;ufferings of friends in that be|half; and not only &s;o, but exhortations to faithfulne&s;s, in this re&s;pect, are rarely omitted.</P>
<P>Their method of procedure in regard to di&s;orderly per&s;ons has been given above, in general terms; be|&s;ides which, there are certain particularities of con|duct, &s;uited to particular ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Their care to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of their poor, and that their offspring &s;hall be properly educated, is a well-known branch of their di&s;cipline, a query to this purpo&s;e being con&s;tantly to be an&s;wered from the par|ticular to the general meetings: nor is their charity confined to their own poor, but extended to all others.</P>
<Q>Their mini&s;ters

<PB N="256" REF="263">Apo&s;tle's advice, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> v. 17. they are e&s;teemed wor|thy of double honour, yet do not, as among &s;ome o|thers, exerci&s;e a lord&s;hip over their brethren, nor deem them&s;elves to be of a cla&s;s or order &s;o far above other men, as not to need the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their brethren, or to be unaccountable to them for their conduct; but do willingly own them&s;elves al&s;o to be proper objects of the church's care, and as &s;uch re&s;pon&s;ible to them in the following important particulars, whereof an account is required to be returned to the quarterly meetings, viz. 1. How are mini&s;tering friends in love and unity one with another, and with faithful brethren in their own meeting? 2. Do none of them travel a|broad, in the work of the mini&s;try, without a certifi|cate from their own monthly meeting? 3. Do they give way to each other, and to &s;trangers, in the exer|ci&s;e of their gifts? 4. Do none overcharge them&s;elves with bu&s;ine&s;s, to the hindrance of their &s;ervice? 5. Are they found in their mini&s;try? 6. Do any of them burthen their hearers with words without life? 7. Do they adorn their doctrine by a &s;uitable conduct and conver&s;ation, as good examples in all re&s;pects?</Q>
<P>Their di&s;cipline, in relation to marriage, merits the attention of other profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity: <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rutty.</NOTE>The man and woman pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the men and womens monthly meetings for church-affairs where they re&s;ide, and there declare their intentions of taking each other as man and wife, if the &s;aid meeting have no material objection again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The principal conditions of their acceptance are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that no man propo&s;e marriage to a woman without the previous con&s;ent of his own and her parents or guardians; and if the un|bridled affections of any &s;hould have precipitated him into a breach of this rule, he is required, pur&s;uant to
<PB N="257" REF="264">the advice of the yearly meeting of London 1707, to remove the offence, and give &s;atisfaction
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">As al&s;o the woman, if &s;he have encouraged it.</NOTE> to &s;uch parents and guardians, and to the meeting to which they do belong, by a due and open acknowledgment of the offence, and condemnation of him&s;elf for it, and to get the con&s;ent of &s;uch parents or guardians before he &s;hall be permitted to proceed to accompli&s;h his in|tended marriage.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the parties be of the &s;ame faith and judg|ment in matters of religion, and profe&s;&s;ed members of this &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="3">3. That none &s;hall marry within &s;uch degrees of con&s;anguinity or affinity as are forbidden by the law of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whereas the admi&s;&s;ion of any marriage to be ce|lebrated, according to the rules of this &s;ociety, is an acknowledgment of the per&s;ons thus admitted as bre|thren and &s;i&s;ters of the community; if either of the&s;e &s;hould formerly have been guilty of any mi&s;demeanour, whereby &s;candal had been brought on the &s;ociety, it hath, in &s;uch ca&s;e, been the con&s;tant practice in this nation, that, upon this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, &s;uch &s;hould condemn their fault, which, for the mo&s;t part, is done in writing.</P>
<P>Where no ob&s;tacles on any of the&s;e accounts appear, or having appeared, are removed, the meeting pa&s;&s;es the propo&s;als of marriage, takes a minute thereof, and appoints proper per&s;ons to enquire into the clearne&s;s of the parties from all others, and to hold corre&s;pondence with other monthly meetings to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, if the parties have re&s;ided in different places. It al&s;o or|ders the intentions of marriage to be publi&s;hed at lea&s;t in two &s;undry public meetings where the man and wo|man re&s;ide, or have re&s;ided, before the marriage be &s;olemnized, in order that convenient time may be al|lowed
<PB N="258" REF="265">for &s;atisfaction concerning their clearne&s;s from all &s;candal, pre-contracts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The parties are required to give their attendance a &s;econd time at the monthly meeting, which is u&s;ually the next en&s;uing, or the next after, where the per&s;ons appointed to make the enquiry above mentioned re|turn an account of the re&s;ult, which if it prove &s;ati&s;|factory to the meeting, the parties are at liberty to pro|ceed to the accompli&s;hment of their marriage, for which purpo&s;e it was the ancient practice to appoint a parti|cular meeting, whereat twelve faithful witne&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t, were required to be pre&s;ent; but of later years marriages in this nation have been commonly &s;olem|nized in the ordinary public meetings for wor&s;hip, which hath had this good effect, to make public and &s;trongly recommend this decent and comely order to all &s;ober and impartial ob&s;ervers. Here the man and wo|man take each other as hu&s;band and wife, and promi&s;e each other, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be loving and faithful in that relation till death &s;eparate them. Of all the&s;e proceedings a narrative is kept in the way of certificate, to which the &s;aid parties fir&s;t &s;et their hands, thereby making it their own act and deed, and then divers of the relations, &s;pectators, and auditors, &s;et their names, as witne&s;&s;es of what they have &s;aid and &s;igned; and this certificate is afterwards regi&s;tered in the record belonging to the meeting where the mar|riage is &s;olemnized.</P>
<P>There is yet another thing that always, in this nation, becomes the &s;ubject of the care of the &s;ame monthly meeting, <HI>viz.</HI> to appoint two per&s;ons as over|&s;eers, to take care that the marriage be &s;olemnized with mode&s;ty and gravity, and to di&s;courage &s;uper|fluities of eating, drinking, apparel, wanton beha|viour, &amp;c. upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to &s;econd marriages, the&s;e two things chiefly fall under their care and cognizance:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="259" REF="266">1. If the man be a widower, or the woman a wi|dow, and have children by a former wife or hu&s;band, that provi&s;ion be previou&s;ly made for &s;uch children where it can conveniently be done.</P>
<P N="2">2. Friends &s;hould not proceed in &s;econd marriages until a year is elap&s;ed from the death of the former wife or hu&s;band; and the practice accordingly hath been &s;uch, and more early procedure condemned and forbidden as indecent.</P></Q>
<P>To their yearly meeting held in London every Whit|&s;untide, which &s;ometimes la&s;teth four, five, or more days, are admitted &s;uch as are &s;ent from all churches of that &s;ociety in the world, to give an account of the &s;tate of their particular churches, which from &s;ome places is done only by writing; and from this meeting is &s;ent a <HI>general epi&s;tle</HI> to all the churches, which com|monly is printed, and &s;ometimes particular epi&s;tles are &s;ent to churches re&s;pectively, by which it is known in what condition their churches are every year; and in the &s;aid epi&s;tle there is always recommended a godly life and conver&s;ation, and due care about the education of children. If it happens that the poor any where are in want, then that is &s;upplied by others that have in &s;tore, or &s;ometimes by an extraordinary collection. I have &s;ubjoined one of tho&s;e epi&s;tles for my readers &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>An</HI> EPISTLE <HI>from the annual meeting in London, held by adjournment from the</HI> 10th <HI>day of the fourth month, to the</HI> 14th <HI>of the &s;ame inclu&s;ive,</HI> 1717, <HI>to the quarterly and monthly meeting of friends in Great Britain and el&s;ewhere.</HI></P>
<P>OUR &s;alutation in the love of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our ble&s;&s;ed Lord is freely extended to you, who&s;e tender care over, and favour to this our annual a&s;&s;embly, we do humbly and thankfully acknowledge, in the love, amity, ten|der conde&s;cen&s;ion, and peaceable procedure thereof,
<PB N="260" REF="267">with regard to the divine power and goodne&s;s of the Lord our God, and the &s;ervice of his church and peo|ple, &s;incerely de&s;iring the pro&s;perity of his whole heri|tage, even in all the churches of Chri&s;t among us, in his dear love, unity, and peace, to his eternal glory, and our univer&s;al comfort and perpetual joy in the kingdom of the dear Son of God.</P>
<P>We are truly comforted in that we under&s;tand there is &s;uch a general concurrence and union among friends, which was our former earne&s;t de&s;ires and coun&s;el for true and univer&s;al love, unity, peace, and good order to be earne&s;tly endeavoured and maintained among&s;t us, as a peculiar people cho&s;en of the Lord out of this world, to bear a faithful te&s;timony to his holy name and truth in all re&s;pects; and that all that is contrary be watched again&s;t and avoided, as &s;trife, di&s;cord, con|tentions, and di&s;putes tending to divi&s;ions, may be ut|terly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a&s;ide, as the light and righte|ous judgment of truth require.</P>
<P>Oh! that all the churches and congregations of the faithful would be excited by the Spirit of the dear Son of God, fervently to pray for the pro&s;perity of his church and people throughout the world, that Sion may more and more &s;hine in the beauty of holine&s;s, to the glory and prai&s;e of the King of Glory.</P>
<P>The friends and brethren, come up from the &s;everal quarterly meetings in this nation, have given a good account, to this meeting, of truth's pro&s;perity, and that friends are generally at love and unity with one another; and by &s;everal epi&s;tles from North Carolina, Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ylvania. Maryland, Barbadoes, Holland, Scot|land, Ireland, and Wales, which have been read in this meeting, as al&s;o by verbal accounts given by &s;e|veral friends that have lately travelled in divers parts of America and el&s;ewhere, we have received comfort|able a counts of the &s;tate of truth and friends in tho&s;e parts, by which we are encouraged to hope truth pre|vails in many places, and a concern grows upon friends
<PB N="261" REF="268">for the pro&s;perity thereof, and that there is an incli|nation in people to hear the truth declared.</P>
<P>By the accounts brought up this year we find, that friends &s;uffering in England and Wales amount to 4290l. chiefly for tithes, prie&s;ts wages, and &s;teeple|hou&s;e rates; and that notwith&s;tanding four friends were di&s;charged la&s;t year, there yet remain twenty friends pri&s;oners on the&s;e accounts.</P>
<P>We advi&s;e that a tender care remain upon friends, in all places, to be faithful in keeping up our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony again&s;t tithes, as being ju&s;tly per&s;uaded it is that whereunto God hath called his people in this our day, we &s;eeing by daily experience that &s;uch as are not faithful therein, do thereby add to the &s;ufferings of other friends, and hinder their own growth and pro&s;perity in the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed truth.</P>
<P>As touching the education of friends children, for which this meeting hath always a tender concern, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to recommend to you the nece&s;&s;ity there is of a care of pre&s;erving of them in a plainne&s;s of &s;peech and habit &s;uitable to our holy profe&s;&s;ion; and al&s;o that no opportunity be omitted, nor any endea|vours wanting, to in&s;truct them in the principles of truth which we profe&s;s, that thereby they being &s;en&s;i|ble of the operation thereof in them&s;elves, may find not only their &s;pirits &s;oftened and rendered fit to re|ceive the impre&s;&s;ions of the divine image, but may al|&s;o from thence find them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity to ap|pear clear in the &s;everal branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;ti|mony: and as this will be mo&s;t beneficial to them, being the fruits of conviction, &s;o it is the mo&s;t effec|tual way of propagating the &s;ame throughout the churches of Chri&s;t: and there being times and &s;ea&s;ons wherein their &s;pirits are more than at others di&s;po&s;ed to have the&s;e things impre&s;&s;ed upon them, &s;o we de|&s;ire that all parents, and others concerned in the over|&s;ight of youth, might wait in the fear of God to know them&s;elves divinely qualified for that &s;ervice, that in
<PB N="262" REF="269">his wi&s;dom they may make u&s;e of every &s;uch opportu|nity which the Lord &s;hall put into their hands. And we do hereby warn and advi&s;e friends in all places to flee every appearance of evil, and to avoid pride, and following the vain fa&s;hions and cu&s;toms of this world, as recommended in our epi&s;tle 1715.</P>
<P>And as we always found it our concern to recom|mend love, unity, and concord in the churches of Chri&s;t every where, &s;o, as a means to effect the &s;ame, we earne&s;tly de&s;ire that friends, but more e&s;pecially &s;uch who are concerned in meetings of bu&s;ine&s;s, do la|bour to know their own &s;pirits, to be &s;ubjected by the &s;pirit of truth, that thereby, being bapti&s;ed into one body, they may be truly one in the foundation of their love and unity, and that therein they may all labour to find a nearne&s;s to each other in &s;pirit, this being the true way to a thorough reconciliation, where-ever there is or may have been any difference of apprehen&s;ion; thereby friends will be pre&s;erved in that &s;weetne&s;s of &s;pirit that is and will be the bond of true peace through|out all the churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, the friends of this meeting, to whom the in&s;pection of the accounts was referred, made report, that having peru&s;ed the &s;ame, they found the &s;tock nearly expended; whereupon this meeting thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to recommend unto you, that a ge|neral and free contribution be made in every county, and that what &s;hall be thereupon collected be &s;ent up to the re&s;pective corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>Finally, dear friends and brethren, be careful to walk unblameable in love and peace among your&s;elves, and towards all men in Chri&s;tian charity; and be hum|bly thankful to the Lord, our mo&s;t gracious God, for the favour he hath given us in the eyes of the King and civil government, in the peaceable enjoyment of our religious and Chri&s;tian liberty under them; and the God of peace, we tru&s;t, will be with you to the end.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Hi&s;tory of the</HI> METHODISTS.</HEAD>
<P>COntrary to my u&s;ual method, I think proper to be|gin with the principles of this popular &s;ect, be|fore I give an account of their ri&s;e and progre&s;s; and, fir&s;t, I &s;hall lay before my readers <HI>the character of a Me|thodi&s;t,</HI> as drawn by the Rev. Mr. John We&s;ley, who, tho' he may differ in a few points from the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, the founder of Methodi&s;m, yet &s;peaks, in mo&s;t things, the &s;en&s;e of the whole body
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He introduces it, by &s;aying, he does "now give the cleare&s;t account <HI>he</HI> can, <HI>in the pre&s;ence of the Lord and judge of heaven and earth,</HI> of the principles and practices, whereby tho&s;e who are called <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men."</NOTE>.</P>
<Q><PB N="267" REF="274"><P N="1">1. The di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of a Methodi&s;t are not his opinions of any &s;ort. His a&s;&s;enting to this or that &s;cheme of religion, his embracing any particular &s;et of notions, his e&s;pou&s;ing the judgment of one man or of another, are all quite wide of the point. Who|&s;oever therefore imagines, that a Methodi&s;t is, a man of &s;uch or &s;uch an opinion, is gro&s;ly ignorant of the whole affair: he mi&s;takes the truth totally. We be|lieve indeed, that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God; and herein we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from Jews, Turks, and Infidels. We believe the written word of God to be the only and &s;ufficient rule, both of Chri&s;tian faith and practice; and herein we are fundamentally di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h church. We believe Chri&s;t to be the eternal &s;upreme God; and herein are we di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Socinians and Arians. But as to all opinions which do not &s;trike at the root of Chri&s;tianity, we think and let think. So that what&s;oever they are, whether right or wrong, they are no di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of a Methodi&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither are words or phra&s;es of any &s;ort. We do not place our religion, or any part of it, in being attached to any peculiar mode of &s;peaking, any quaint or uncommon &s;et of expre&s;&s;ions. The mo&s;t obvious, ea&s;y, common words, wherein our meaning can be conveyed, we prefer before others, both on ordinary occa&s;ions, and when we &s;peak of the things of God. We never therefore willingly or de&s;ignedly deviate from the mo&s;t u&s;ual way of &s;peaking; unle&s;s when we expre&s;s &s;cripture truths in &s;cripture words (which we pre&s;ume no Chri&s;tian will condemn.) Neither do we affect to u&s;e any particular expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture, more fre|quently than others, unle&s;s they are &s;uch as are more frequently u&s;ed by the in&s;pired writers them&s;elves. So that it is as gro&s;s an error, to place the marks of a Methodi&s;t in his words, as in opinions of any &s;ort.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor do we de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by actions, cu&s;toms, or u&s;ages, of an indifferent nature. Our re|ligion
<PB N="268" REF="275">does not lie in doing what God hath not enjoined, or ab&s;taining from what he hath not forbidden. It does not lie in the form of our apparel, in the po&s;ture of our body, or the covering of our heads; nor yet in ab|&s;taining from marriage, nor from meats and drinks, which are all good if received with thank&s;giving. Therefore neither will any man who knows whereof he affirms, fix the mark of a Methodi&s;t here; in any ac|tions or cu&s;toms purely indifferent, undertermined by the word of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor, la&s;tly, is he to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by laying the whole &s;tre&s;s of religion on any &s;ingle part of it. If you &s;ay, "Yes, he is; for he thinks we are &s;aved by faith alone:" I an&s;wer, you do not under&s;tand the terms. By &s;alvation he means, holine&s;s of heart and life. And this he affirms to &s;pring from true faith alone. Can even a nominal Chri&s;tian deny it? Is this placing a part of religion for the whole? Do we then make void the law thro' faith? God forbid! Yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the law. We do not place the whole of religion (as too many do, God knoweth) either in doing no harm, or in doing good, or in u&s;ing the ordinances of God: No, nor in all of them together; wherein we know, by experience, a man may labour many years, and at the end have no true religion at all, no more than he had at the beginning. Much le&s;s in any one of the&s;e; or, it may be in a &s;crap of one of them: like her who fancies her&s;elf a virtuous woman, only becau&s;e &s;he is not a pro&s;titute; or him who dreams he is an hone&s;t man, merely becau&s;e he does not rob or &s;teal. May the Lord God of my fathers pre&s;erve me from &s;uch a poor, &s;tarved religion as this! Were this the mark of a Methodi&s;t, I would &s;ooner chu&s;e to be a &s;incere Jew, Turk, or Pagan.</P>
<P N="5">5. What then is the mark? Who is a Methodi&s;t according to your own account? I an&s;wer: A Me|thodi&s;t is one, who has the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Gho&s;t given unto him: one
<PB N="269" REF="276">who loves the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his &s;oul, and with all his mind, and with all his &s;trength. God is the joy of his heart, and the de|&s;ire of his &s;oul; which is con&s;tantly crying out, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide thee! My God and my all! thou art the &s;trength of my heart, and my portion for ever!"</P>
<P N="6">6. He is therefore happy in God, yea always happy, as having in him a well of water, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life, and overflowing his &s;oul with peace and joy. Perfect love having now ca&s;t out fear, he rejoices evermore. He rejoices in the Lord always, even in God his Saviour: and in the Father, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom he hath now received the atone|ment. Having found redemption thro' his blood, the forgivenne&s;s of his &s;ins, he cannot but rejoice, when|ever he looks back on the horrible pit out of which he is delivered, when he &s;ees all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions blotted out as a cloud, and his iniquities as a thick cloud. He cannot but rejoice, whenever he looks on the &s;tate wherein he now is, being ju&s;tified freely, and having peace with God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For he that believeth hath the witne&s;s of this in him&s;elf: being now the Son of God by faith; becau&s;e he is a Son, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into his heart, crying out, Abba, Father! And the Spirit it&s;elf bear|eth witne&s;s with his &s;pirit, that he is a child of God. He rejoiceth al&s;o, whenever he looks forward in hope of the glory that &s;hall be revealed: yea, this his joy is full, and all his bones cry out, Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten me again to a living hope&mdash;of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for me.</P>
<P N="7">7. And he who hath this hope thus full of immorta|lity, in every thing giveth thanks; as knowing that this (what&s;oever it is) is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us
<PB N="270" REF="277">concerning him. From him therefore he chearfully re|ceives all, &s;aying, Good is the will of the Lord; and whether the Lord giveth or taketh away, equally ble&s;|&s;ing the name of the Lord. For he hath learned in what&s;oever &s;tare he is, therewith to be content. He knoweth both how to be aba&s;ed, and how to abound. Every where and in all things he is in&s;tructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uffer need. Whether in ea&s;e or pain, whether in &s;ickne&s;s or health, whether in life or death, he giveth thanks from the ground of the heart to him who orders it for good: knowing that as every good gift cometh from above, &s;o none but good can come from the Father of Light, into who&s;e hands he has wholly committed his body and &s;oul, as into the hands of a faithful Creator. He is therefore careful (anxiou&s;ly or unea&s;ily careful) for no|thing; as having ca&s;t all his care on him that careth for him, and in all things re&s;ting on him, after making his reque&s;t known to him with thank&s;giving.</P>
<P N="8">8. For indeed he prays without cea&s;ing. It is given him always to pray and not to faint. Not that he is always in the hou&s;e of prayer; tho' he neglects no op|portunity of being there. Neither is he always on his knees, altho' he often is, or on his face, before the Lord his God. Nor yet is he always crying aloud to God, or calling upon him in words. For many times the Spirit maketh interce&s;&s;ion for him with groans that cannot be uttered: but at all times the language of his heart is this, "Thou brightne&s;s of the eternal glory, unto thee is my mouth, tho' without a voice, and my &s;ilence &s;peaketh unto thee." And this is true prayer, &mdash;the lifting up the heart to God. This is the e&s;&s;ence of prayer, and this alone. But his heart is ever lifted up to God, at all times and in all places. In this he is never hindered, much le&s;s interrupted by any per&s;on or thing. In retirement, or company, in lei&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s or conver&s;ation, his heart is ever with the Lord. Whe|ther he lie down or ri&s;e up, God is in all his thoughts;
<PB N="271" REF="278">he walks with God continually, having the loving eye of his mind &s;till fixed upon him, and every where &s;ee|ing him that is invi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="9">9. And while he thus always exerci&s;es his love to God, by praying without cea&s;ing, rejoicing evermore, and in every thing giving thanks, this commandment is writ|ten in his heart, that he who loveth God, loves his brother al&s;o. And he accordingly loves his neighbour as him&s;elf; he loves every man as his own &s;oul. His heart is full of love to all mankind, to every child of the Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h. That a man is not per&s;onally known to him, is no bar to his love: no, nor that he is known to be &s;uch as he approves not, that he repays hatred for his good-will; for he loves his enemies, yea and the enemies of God, the evil and the unthankful: and if it be not in his power to do good to them that hate him, yet he cea&s;es not to pray for them, though they continue to &s;purn his love, and &s;till de&s;pitefully u&s;e him and per&s;ecute him.</P>
<P N="10">10. For he is pure in heart. The love of God has purified his heart from all revengeful pa&s;&s;ions, from en|vy, malice, and wrath, from every unkind temper or malign affection. It hath clean&s;ed him from pride and haughtine&s;s of &s;pirit, whereof alone cometh contention; and he hath now put on bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long &s;uffering: &s;o that he forbears and forgives, if he had a quarrel again&s;t any, even as God in Chri&s;t hath forgiven him. And indeed all po&s;&s;ible ground for contention, on his part, is utterly cut off; for none can take from him what he de&s;ires, &s;eeing he loves not the world, nor any of the things of the world, being now crucified to the world, and the world crucified to him; being dead to all that is in the world, both to the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life; for all his de&s;ire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name.</P>
<P N="11">11. Agreeable to this his one de&s;ire, is the one de&s;ire of his life, namely, not to do his own will, but the
<PB N="272" REF="279">will of him that &s;ent him. His one intention at all times, and in all things, is, not to plea&s;e him&s;elf, but him whom his &s;oul loveth. He has a &s;ingle eye; and becau&s;e his eye is &s;ingle, his whole body is full of light. Indeed, where the loving eye of the &s;oul is continually fixed upon God, there can be no darkne&s;s at all, but the whole is light, as when the bright &s;hining of a can|dle doth enlighten the hou&s;e&punc; God then reigns alone. All that is in the &s;oul is holine&s;s to the Lord. There is not a motion in his heart but is according to his will. Every thought that ari&s;es points to him, and is in obe|dience to the law of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12. And the tree is known by its fruits; for as he loves God, &s;o he keeps his commandments; not only &s;ome, or mo&s;t of them, but all, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t. He is not content to keep the whole law, and offend in one point, but has in all points a con|&s;cience void of offence towards God and towards man. Whatever God has forbidden, he avoids; whatever God hath enjoined, he doth; and that whether it be little or great, hard or ea&s;y, joyous or grievous to the fle&s;h. He runs the ways of God's commandments, now he hath &s;et his heart at liberty. It is his glory &s;o to do; it is his daily crown of rejoicing, to do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven; knowing it is the highe&s;t privilege of the angels of God, of tho&s;e that excel in &s;trength, to fulfil his commandments, and hearken to the voice of his word.</P>
<P N="13">13. All the commandments of God he accordingly keeps, and that with all his might; for his obedience is in proportion to his love, the &s;ource from whence it flows; and therefore, loving God with all his heart, he &s;erves him with all his &s;trength. He continually pre&s;ents his &s;oul and body a living &s;acrifice, holy, ac|ceptable to God; entirely and without re&s;erve devoting him&s;elf, all he has, and all he is, to his glory. All the talents he has received he con&s;tantly employs, ac|cording to his Ma&s;ter's will; every power and faculty
<PB N="273" REF="280">of his &s;oul, every member of his body. Once he yield|ed them unto &s;in and the devil, as in&s;truments of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s: but now, being alive from the dead, he yields them all, as in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto God.</P>
<P N="14">14. By con&s;equence, what&s;oever he doth, it is all to the glory of God. In all his employments of every kind, he not only aims at this (which is implied in having a &s;ingle eye) but actually attains it. His bu|&s;ine&s;s and refre&s;hments, as well as his prayers, all &s;erve to this great end. Whether he &s;it in his hou&s;e or walk by the way, whether he lie down or ri&s;e up, he is pro|moting in all he &s;peaks or does, the one bu&s;ine&s;s of his life: whether he put on his apparel, or labour, or eat and drink, or divert him&s;elf from too wa&s;ting labour, it all tends to advance the glory of God, by peace and good-will among men. His one invariable rule is this, What&s;oever ye do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</P>
<P N="15">15. Nor do the cu&s;toms of the world at all hinder his running the race that is &s;et before him. He knows that vice does not lo&s;e its nature, though it becomes ever &s;o fa&s;hionable; and remembers, that every man is to give an account of him&s;elf to God. He cannot, therefore, even follow a multitude to do evil. He can|not fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, or make provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof. He cannot lay up trea&s;ures upon earth, no more than he can take fire in|to his bo&s;om. He cannot adorn him&s;elf (on any pre|tence) with gold or co&s;tly apparel; he cannot join in, or countenance any diver&s;ion which has the lea&s;t ten|dency to vice of any kind. He cannot &s;peak evil of his neighbour, no more than he can lie, either for God or man. He cannot utter an unkind word of any one; for love-keeps the door of his lips. He cannot &s;peak idle words: no corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth, as is all that which is not good, to the
<PB N="274" REF="281">u&s;e of edifying, not fit to mini&s;ter grace to the hearers. But what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are ju&s;tly of good report, he thinks, and &s;peaks, and acts, adorning the doctrine of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all things.</P>
<P N="16">16. La&s;tly, as he has time, he does good unto all men; unto neighbours and &s;trangers, friends and ene|mies; and that in every po&s;&s;ible kind; not only to their bodies, by feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, vi&s;iting tho&s;e that are &s;ick or in pri&s;on; but much more does he labour to do good to their &s;ouls, as of the ability which God giveth: to awaken tho&s;e that &s;leep in death; to bring tho&s;e who are awakened to the atoning blood, that, being ju&s;tified by faith, they may have peace with God, and to provoke tho&s;e who have peace with God to abound more in love and in good works; and he is willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent herein, even to be offered up on the &s;acrifice and &s;er|vice of their faith, &s;o they may all come unto the mea|&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="17">17. The&s;e are the principles and practices of our &s;ect, the&s;e are the marks of a true Methodi&s;t. By the&s;e alone do tho&s;e who are in deri&s;ion &s;o called, de|&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men. If any man &s;ay, "Why the&s;e are only the common, fundamental principles of Chri&s;tianity!" Thou ha&s;t &s;aid: &s;o I mean; this is the very truth; I know they are no other; and I would to God both thou and all men knew, that I, and all who follow my judgment, do vehemently re|fu&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men, by any but the common principles of Chri&s;tianity. The plain, old Chri&s;tianity that I teach, renouncing and dete&s;ting all other m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rks of di&s;tinction; and who&s;oever is what I preach (let him be called what he will, for names change not the nature of things) he is a Chri&s;tian, not in name only, but in heart and in life. He is inward|ly and outwardly conformed to the will of God, as re|vealed in the written word. He thinks, &s;peaks, and
<PB N="275" REF="282">lives according to the method laid down in the Reve|lation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. His &s;oul is renewed after the image of God, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and in all true holine&s;s; and having the mind that was in Chri&s;t, he &s;o walks as Chri&s;t al&s;o walked.</P>
<P N="18">18. By the&s;e marks, by the&s;e fruits of a living faith do we labour to di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves from the unbe|lieving world, from all tho&s;e who&s;e minds or lives are not according to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. But from real Chri&s;tians, of what&s;oever denomination they be, we earne&s;tly de&s;ire not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed at all; not from any who &s;incerely follow after what they know they have not yet attained. No: who&s;oever doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, the &s;ame is my bro|ther, and &s;i&s;ter, and mother: and I be&s;eech you, bre|thren, by the mercies of God, that we be in no wi&s;e divided among our&s;elves. Is thy heart right, as my hart is with thine? I a&s;k no farther que&s;tion. If it be, give me thy hand. For opinions, or terms, let us not de&s;troy the work of God. Do&s;t thou love and &s;erve God? it is enough. I give thee the right-hand of fellow&s;hip. If there be any con&s;olation in Chri&s;t, if any comfort of love, if any fellow&s;hip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, let us &s;trive together for the faith of the go&s;pel, walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called, with all lowline&s;s and meek|ne&s;s, with long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; remembering there is one body and one &s;pirit, even as we are called with one hope of our calling; one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all!</P></Q>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> PRINCIPLES <HI>of a</HI> METHODIST, <HI>by the &s;ame Author. Of Ju&s;tification by Faith.</HI></HEAD>
<Q><P>I believe ju&s;tification by faith alone; for I am firmly per&s;uaded, that every man of the offspring of
<PB N="276" REF="283">Adam is very far gone from original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own nature inclined to evil: that this corrup|tion of our nature, in every per&s;on born into the world, de&s;erves God's wrath and damnation: that therefore, if ever we receive the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins, and are ac|counted righteous before God, it mu&s;t be only for the merits of Chri&s;t, by faith, and not for our own works or de&s;ervings of any kind. Nay, I am per&s;uaded, that all works done before ju&s;tification have in them the nature of &s;in; and that con&s;equently, till he is ju&s;tified, a man has no power to do any work which is plea&s;ing and acceptable to God.</P>
<P>I believe three things mu&s;t go together in our ju&s;ti|fication; upon God's part, his great mercy and grace; upon Chri&s;t's part, the &s;atisfaction of God's ju&s;tice, by the offering his body, and &s;hedding his blood, and fulfilling the law of God perfectly; and upon our part, true and living faith in the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: &s;o that in our ju&s;tification there is not only God's mercy and grace, but his ju&s;tice al&s;o: and &s;o the grace of God does not &s;hut out the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in our ju&s;tification, but only &s;huts out the righteou&s;ne&s;s of man, that is, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our works; and therefore St. Paul requires nothing on the part of man, but only a true and living faith. Yet this faith does not &s;hut out repentance, hope, and love, which are joined with faith in every man that is ju&s;tified; but it &s;huts them out from the office of ju&s;tifying; &s;o that al|though they are all pre&s;ent together in him that is ju&s;ti|fied, yet they ju&s;tify not all together. Neither does faith &s;hut out good works, nece&s;&s;arily to be done after|wards; but we may not do them to this intent, to be ju&s;tified by doing them. Our ju&s;tification comes free|ly, of the mere mercy of God: for whereas all the world was not able to pay any part towards their ran|&s;om, it plea&s;ed him, without any of our de&s;erving, to prepare for us Chri&s;t's body and blood, whereby our ran&s;om might be paid, his law fulfilled, and his ju&s;tice
<PB N="277" REF="284">&s;atisfied. Chri&s;t therefore is now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of all them that truly believe in him. He for them paid the ran&s;om by his death. He for them fulfilled the law in his life. So that now in him, and by him, eve|ry believer may be called a fulfiller of the law.</P>
<P>But let it be ob&s;erved, the true &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words, "we are ju&s;tified by faith in Chri&s;t only," is not, that this our own act, to believe in Chri&s;t, or this our faith which is within us, ju&s;tifies us (for that were to ac|count our&s;elves to be ju&s;tified by &s;ome act or virtue that is within us): but that altho' we have faith, hope, and love within us, and do never &s;o many good works, yet we mu&s;t renounce the merit of all, of faith, hope, love, and all other virtues and good works, which we either have done, &s;hall do, or can do, as far too weak to de&s;erve our ju&s;tification: for which therefore we mu&s;t tru&s;t only in God's mercy, and the merits of Chri&s;t. For it is he alone that taketh away our &s;ins. To him alone are we to go for this; &s;or&s;aking all our virtues, good words, thoughts, and works, and put|ting our tru&s;t in Chri&s;t only. In &s;trictne&s;s therefore, neither our faith nor our works ju&s;tify us, <HI>i. e.</HI> de&s;erve the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins: but God him&s;elf ju&s;tifies us, of his own mercy, through the merits of his Son only. Neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e by faith we embrace the promi&s;e of God's mercy, and of the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins, there|fore the &s;cripture &s;ays, that faith does ju&s;tify, yea, faith without works. And as it is all one to &s;ay, faith without works, and faith alone ju&s;tifies us, therefore the antient fathers from time to time &s;peak thus; Faith alone ju&s;tifies us. And becau&s;e we receive faith thro' the only merits of Chri&s;t, and not thro' the merit of any virtue we have, or work we do; therefore in that re&s;pect we renounce, as it were, again, faith, works, and all other virtues. For our corruption thro' original &s;in is &s;o great, that all our faith, charity, words, and works, cannot merit or de&s;erve any part of our ju&s;ti|fication for us: and therefore we thus &s;peak, humbling
<PB N="278" REF="285">our&s;elves before God, and giving Chri&s;t all the glory of our ju&s;tification. But it &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;erved, what that faith is, whereby we are ju&s;tified. Now that faith which brings not forth good works, is not a living faith, but a dead and devili&s;h one. For even the devils believe, "That Chri&s;t was born of a virgin, that he wrought all kind of miracles, declaring him|&s;elf to be very God; that for our &s;akes he died and ro&s;e again, and a&s;cended into heaven, and at the end of the world &s;hall come again, to judge the quick and the dead." This the devils believe, and &s;o they be|lieve all that is written in the Old and New Te&s;tament; and yet &s;till, for all this faith, they are but devils. They remain &s;till in their damnable e&s;tate, lacking the true Chri&s;tian faith. The true Chri&s;tian faith is, not only to believe the holy &s;criptures and articles of our faith are true, but al&s;o to have a &s;ure tru&s;t and confi|dence to be &s;aved from everla&s;ting damnation by Chri&s;t, whereof doth follow a loving heart, to obey his com|mandments. And this faith neither any devil hath, nor any wicked man. No ungodly man hath or can have this &s;ure tru&s;t and confidence in God, that by the merits of Chri&s;t his &s;ins are forgiven, and be reconciled to the favour of God.</P></Q>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> CHRISTIAN PERFECTION.</HEAD>
<Q><P>Perhaps the general prejudice again&s;t Chri&s;tian perfection may chiefly ari&s;e from a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the nature of it. We willingly allow, and continually declare, there is no &s;uch perfection, in this life, as im|plies a di&s;pen&s;ation from doing good, and attending all the ordinances of God; or a freedom from ignorance, mi&s;take, temptation, and a thou&s;and infirmities nece&s;|&s;arily connected with fle&s;h and blood. Fir&s;t, we not only allow, but earne&s;tly contend (as for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints) that there is no &s;uch perfection in this life, as implies any di&s;pen&s;ation from attending
<PB N="279" REF="286">all the ordinances of God, or from doing good unto all men while we have time, tho' e&s;pecially unto the hou&s;hold of faith. And who&s;oever they are who have taught otherwi&s;e, we are convinced are not taught of God. We dare not receive them, neither bid them God &s;peed, le&s;t we be partakers of their evil deeds. We believe that not only the babes in Chri&s;t, who have newly found redemption in his blood, but tho&s;e al&s;o, who are grown up unto perfect men, unto the mea|&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly obliged (and that they are obliged thereto is their glory and crown of rejoicing) as oft as they have opportunity to eat bread and drink wine, in remem|brance of him; to &s;earch the &s;criptures; by fa&s;ting (as well as temperance) to keep their bodies under, and bring them into &s;ubjection; and above all, to pour out their &s;ouls in prayer, both &s;ecretly, and in the great congregation. We &s;econdly believe, and therefore &s;peak, and that unto all men, and with much a&s;&s;u|rance, that there is no &s;uch perfection in this life, as implies an entire deliverance, either from ignorance or mi&s;take in things not e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, or from manifold temptations, or from numberle&s;s infirmities, wherewith the corruptible body, more or le&s;s, pre&s;&s;es down the &s;oul. This is the &s;ame thing which we have &s;poken from the beginning; if any teach otherwi&s;e, they are not of us. We cannot find any ground in &s;cripture to &s;uppo&s;e, that any inhabitant of an hou&s;e of clay is wholly exempt either from bodily infirmities, or from ignorance of many things; or to imagine any mere man is incapable of mi&s;take, or of falling into divers temptations: No; the di&s;ciple is not above his ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant above his Lord. It is enough that every one who is perfect &s;hall be as his ma&s;ter. But what then, it may be a&s;ked, do you mean by one that is perfect, or one that is as his ma&s;ter? We mean, one in whom is the mind which was in Chri&s;t, and who &s;o walketh as he al&s;o walked; a man that hath
<PB N="280" REF="287">clean hands and a pure heart; or that is clean&s;ed from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit: one in whom there is no occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling, and who accordingly doth not commit &s;in. To declare this a little more parti|cularly, we under&s;tand by that &s;criptural expre&s;&s;ion a <HI>perfect man,</HI> one in whom God hath fulfilled his faith|ful word, "From all your filthine&s;s and from all your idols will I clean&s;e you.&mdash;I will al&s;o &s;ave you from all your uncleanne&s;&s;es." We under&s;tand hereby, one whom God hath &s;anctified throughout, even in body, &s;oul, and &s;pirit: one who walketh in the light, as he is in the light, in whom is no darkne&s;s at all; the blood of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t his Son having clean&s;ed him from all &s;in. This man can now te&s;tify to all mankind, I am crucified with Chri&s;t; neverthele&s;s I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me. He is holy, as God who hath called him is holy, both in heart and in all manner of conver&s;ation. He loveth the Lord his God with all his heart, and &s;erveth him with all his &s;trength. He loveth his neighbour (every man) as him&s;elf; yea, as Chri&s;t loved us: them in particular that de&s;pitefully u&s;e him and per&s;ecute him, becau&s;e they know not the Son, neither the Father. Indeed his &s;oul is all love, filled with bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, meekne&s;s, gen|tlene&s;s, long &s;uffering. And his life agreeth thereto, full of the work of faith, the patience of hope, the la|bour of love: and what&s;oever he doth either in word or deed, he doth it all in the name, in the love and power of the Lord Je&s;us. In a word, he doth the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven. This it is to be a perfect man, to be &s;anctified throughout, created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: even to have a heart &s;o all-flaming with the love of God (to u&s;e Archbi&s;hop U&s;her's words) as continually to offer up every thought, word, and work, as a &s;piritual &s;acrifice, acceptable unto God thro' Chri&s;t. In every thought of our hearts, in every word of our tongues, in every work of our hands, to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e, who hath called us out of dark|ne&s;s,
<PB N="281" REF="288">into his marvellous light! O that both we, and all who &s;eek the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity, may thus be made perfect in one!</P></Q>
<P>If there be any-thing un&s;criptural in the&s;e words, any-thing wild or extravagant, any-thing contrary to the analogy of faith, or the experience of adult Chri&s;|tians, let them &s;mite me friendly and reprove me; let them impart to me of the clearer light God has given them. How knowe&s;t thou, O man, but thou maye&s;t gain thy brother? but he may at length come to the knowledge of the truth? and thy labour of love, &s;hewn forth with meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, may not be in vain?</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> ASSURANCES <HI>of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<Q><P>I believe that conver&s;ion (meaning thereby ju&s;ti|fication) is an in&s;tantaneous work; and the moment a man has living faith in Chri&s;t, he is converted or ju&s;ti|fied: which faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</P>
<P>I believe the moment a man is ju&s;tified he has peace with God: which he cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of forgivene&s;s is often mixed with doubt or fear: but the full a&s;&s;urance of faith excludes all doubt and fear, as the very term implies.</P>
<P>I believe to be ju&s;tified is the &s;ame as to be born of God; and he that is born of God &s;inneth not. Which deliverance from &s;in he cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</P></Q>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> CONDITIONS <HI>of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<Q><P>I believe every man is penitent before he is ju&s;ti|fied; he repents, before he believes the go&s;pel. But it is never before, and generally long after he is ju&s;ti|fied,
<PB N="282" REF="289">that Chri&s;t is formed in him; and that this peni|tence and contrition is the work of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet I believe that all this is nothing towards, and has no influence on our ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Again, I believe that in order to obtain ju&s;tification I mu&s;t go &s;trait to Chri&s;t, with all my ungodline&s;s, and plead nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet I believe we &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon any-thing we do or feel, as if it were nece&s;&s;arily previous to ju&s;tifica|tion. No, not on any-thing el&s;e.</P></Q>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> EFFECTS <HI>of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<Q><P>I believe a man may have a &s;trong a&s;&s;urance he is ju&s;tified, and not be able to affirm he is a child of God.</P>
<P>A man may be fully a&s;&s;ured that his &s;ins are for|given, yet may not be able to tell the day when he re|ceived this full a&s;&s;urance; becau&s;e it grew up in him by degrees.</P>
<P>A man may have a weak faith, at the &s;ame time that he has peace with God, and no unholy de&s;ires.</P>
<P>A man may be ju&s;tified, who has not a clean heart, neither the indwelling of the &s;pirit.</P></Q>
<P>To &s;um up the whole, Mr. We&s;ley de&s;ires not a more con&s;i&s;tent account of his principles than the following words:</P>
<Q><P>Our &s;piritual &s;tate &s;hould be con&s;idered, and di&s;tinctly, under each of the&s;e views.</P>
<P N="1">1. Before ju&s;tification; in which &s;tate we may be &s;aid to be unable to do any-thing acceptable to God: becau&s;e then we can do nothing but come to Chri&s;t; which ought not to be con&s;idered as doing any-thing, but as &s;upplicating (or waiting) to receive a power of doing for the time to come. For the preventing grace of God, which is common to all, is &s;ufficient to bring us to Chri&s;t, though it is not &s;ufficient to carry us any farther, till we are ju&s;tified.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="283" REF="290">2. After ju&s;tification. The moment a man comes to Chri&s;t (by faith) he is ju&s;tified, and born again; that is, he is born again in the imperfect &s;en&s;e (for there are two [if not more] degrees of regeneration); and he has power over all the &s;tirrings and motions of &s;in, but not a total freedom from them. He has Chri&s;t with him, but not Chri&s;t in him. Therefore he hath not yet, in the full and proper &s;en&s;e, a new and clean heart, or the indwelling of the &s;pirit. But be|ing expo&s;ed to various temptations, he may, and will fall again from this condition, if he doth not attain to a more excellent gift.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sanctification; the la&s;t and highe&s;t &s;tate of per|fection in this life. For then are the faithful born again in the full and perfect &s;en&s;e. Then have they the in|dwelling of the &s;pirit. Then is there given unto them a new and clean heart, and the &s;truggle between the old and new man is over.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley, in <HI>An earne&s;t Appeal to Men of Rea&s;on and Religion,</HI> thus further expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in regard to the principles of the Methodi&s;ts:</P>
<Q><P>Although it is with us a very &s;mall thing to be judged of you or of man's judgment, &s;eeing we know God will make our innocency as clear as the light, and our ju&s;t dealing as the noon-day; yet are we ready to give any that are willing to hear, a plain account both of our principles and actions; as having renounced the hidden things of &s;hame, and de&s;iring nothing more, than by manife&s;tation of the truth to commend our|&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>We &s;ee (and who does not) the numberle&s;s follies and mi&s;eries of our fellow-creatures. We &s;ee on every &s;ide, either men of no religion at all, or men of a life|le&s;s, formal religion. We are grieved at the &s;ight, and &s;hould greatly rejoice, if by any means we might con|vince &s;ome, that there is a better religion to be attained, a religion worthy of God that gave it. And this we
<PB N="284" REF="291">conceive to be no other than love; the love of God and of all mankind; the loving God with all our heart, and &s;oul, and &s;trength, as having fir&s;t loved us, as the fountain of all the good we have received, and of all we ever hope to enjoy; and the loving every &s;oul which God hath made, every man on earth, as our own &s;oul.</P>
<P>This love we believe to be the medicine of life, the never-failing remedy, for all the evils of a di&s;or|dered world, for all the mi&s;eries and vices of men. Wherever this is, there are virtue and happine&s;s, go|ing hand-in-hand. There is humblene&s;s of mind, gen|tlene&s;s, long-&s;uffering, the whole image of God, and at the &s;ame time a peace that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, and joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>This religion we long to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, a religion of love and joy and peace, having its &s;eat in the heart, in the inmo&s;t &s;oul, but ever &s;hewing it&s;elf, by its fruits, continually &s;pringing forth not only in all innocence (for love worketh no ill to his neighbour) but likewi&s;e in every kind of beneficence, &s;preading virtue and happine&s;s all around it.</P>
<P>This religion have we been following after for many years, as many know if they would te&s;tify: but all this time, &s;eeking wi&s;dom we found it not; we were &s;pend|ing our &s;trength in vain. And being now under full conviction of this, we declare it to all mankind: for we de&s;ire not that others &s;hould wander out of the way, as we have done before them; but rather that they may profit by our lo&s;s, that they may go (tho' we did not, having then no man to guide us) the &s;treight way to the religion of love, even by faith.</P>
<P>Now faith, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;cripture to be of God, is the demon&s;trative evidence of things un&s;een, the &s;uper|natural evidence of things invi&s;ible, not perceivable by eyes of fle&s;h, or by any of our natural &s;en&s;es or facul|ties. Faith is that divine evidence, whereby the &s;piri|tual man di&s;cerneth God and the things of God. It is with regard to the &s;piritual world, what &s;en&s;e is with
<PB N="285" REF="292">regard to the natural. It is the &s;piritual &s;en&s;ation of every &s;oul that is born of God.</P>
<P>Perhaps you have not con&s;idered it in this view; I will then explain it a little further.</P>
<P>Faith, according to the &s;criptural account, is the eye of the new born &s;oul. Hereby every true believer in God &s;eeth him who is invi&s;ible. Hereby (in a more particular manner &s;ince life and immortality have been brought to light by the go&s;pel) he &s;eeth the light of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and, behold|eth what manner of love it is, which the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we (who are born of the Spi|rit) &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God.</P>
<P>It is the ear of the &s;oul, whereby a &s;inner hears the voice of the Son of God and lives; even that voice which alone wakes the dead, Son, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee.</P>
<P>It is (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) the palate of the &s;oul: for hereby a believer ta&s;tes the good word, and the powers of the world to come; and hereby he both ta&s;tes and &s;ees that God is gracious, yea, and merciful to him a &s;inner.</P>
<P>It is the feeling of the &s;oul, whereby a believer per|ceives, thro' the power of the Highe&s;t over&s;hadowing him, both the exi&s;tence and the pre&s;ence of him, in whom he lives, moves, and has his being; and indeed the whole invi&s;ible world, the entire &s;y&s;tem of things eternal. And hereby, in particular, he feels the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart.</P>
<P>By this faith we are &s;aved from all unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, from the angui&s;h of a wounded &s;pirit, from di&s;content, from fear, and &s;orrow of heart, and from that inex|pre&s;&s;ible li&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and wearine&s;s, both of the world and of our&s;elves, which we had &s;o helple&s;ly laboured under for many years; e&s;pecially when we were out of the hurry of the world, and &s;unk into calm reflection. In this we find that love of God, and of all mankind, which we had el&s;ewhere &s;ought in vain. This we know
<PB N="286" REF="293">and feel, and therefore cannot but declare &s;aves every one that partakes of it, both from &s;in and mi&s;ery, from every unhappy and every unholy temper.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k, "Why then have not all men this faith? all at lea&s;t who conceive it to be &s;o happy a thing? why do they not believe immediately?"</P>
<P>We an&s;wer (on the &s;cripture-hypothe&s;is) It is the gift of God. No man is able to work it in him&s;elf. It is a work of Omnipotence. It requires no le&s;s power thus to quicken a dead &s;oul, than to rai&s;e a body that lies in the grave. It is a new creation; and none can create a &s;oul anew but he who at fir&s;t created the heavens and the earth.</P>
<P>May not your own experience teach you this? Can you give your&s;elf this faith? Is it now in your power to &s;ee, or hear, or ta&s;te, or feel God? Have you al|ready, or can you rai&s;e in your&s;elf, any perception of God, or of an invi&s;ible world? I &s;uppo&s;e you do not deny that there is an invi&s;ible world: you will not charge it in poor old He&s;iod, to Chri&s;tian prejudice of education, when he &s;ays, in tho&s;e well-known words,
<Q><L>Millions of &s;piritual creatures walk the earth</L>
<L>Un&s;een, whether we wake, or if we &s;leep.</L></Q> Now, is there any power in your &s;oul, whereby you di&s;cern either the&s;e, or him that created them? Or, can all your wi&s;dom and &s;trength open an intercour&s;e between your&s;elf and the world of &s;pirits? Is it in your power to bur&s;t the veil that is on your heart, and let in the light of eternity? You know it is not. You not only do not, but cannot (by your own &s;trength) thus believe. The more you labour &s;o to do, the more you will be convinced, it is the gift of God.</P>
<P>It is the free gift of God, which he be&s;tows not on tho&s;e who are worthy of his favour, not on &s;uch as are previou&s;ly holy, and &s;o fit to be crowned with all the ble&s;&s;ings of his goodne&s;s; but on the ungodly and un|holy; on tho&s;e who, till that hour, were fit only for everla&s;ting de&s;truction; tho&s;e in whom was no good
<PB N="287" REF="294">thing, and who&s;e only plea was, God be merciful to me a &s;inner. No merit, no goodne&s;s in man, pre|cedes the forgiving love of God. His pardoning mer|cy &s;uppo&s;es nothing in us but a &s;en&s;e of mere &s;in and mi&s;ery: and to all who &s;ee, and feel, and own their wants, and their utter inability to remove them, God freely gives faith, for the &s;ake of him in whom he is always well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort rude &s;ketch of the doctrine we teach. The&s;e are our fundamental principles; and we &s;pend our lives in confirming others herein, and in a beha|viour &s;uitable to them.</P></Q>
<P>After a great deal of &s;hrewd and pertinent rea&s;oning, he goes on to vindicate the&s;e doctrines in a manner pe|culiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<Q><P>Perhaps the fir&s;t thing that now occurs to your mind relates to the doctrine which we teach. You have heard that we &s;ay, "Men may live without &s;in;" and have you not heard, that the &s;cripture &s;ays the &s;ame (we mean, without committing &s;in)? Does not St. Paul &s;ay plainly, that tho&s;e who believe do not continue in?&mdash;that they cannot live any longer there|in? <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 1, 2. Does not St. Peter &s;ay, He that hath &s;uffered in the fle&s;h hath cea&s;ed from &s;in?&mdash;that he no longer &s;hould live&mdash;to the de&s;ires of men, but to the will of God? 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 1, 2. And does not St. John &s;ay mo&s;t expre&s;sly, He that committeth &s;in is of the devil?&mdash;For this purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;t, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil. Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in; for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot com|mit &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 8, &amp;c. And again, We know that who&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not, ch. v. 18.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, then, it is not we that &s;ay this, but the Lord. The&s;e are not our words, but his. And who is he that replieth again&s;t God? Who is able to make God a liar? Surely he will be ju&s;tified in his &s;aying,
<PB N="288" REF="295">and cleared when he is judged! Can you deny it? Have you not often felt a &s;ecret check, when you was con|tradicting this great truth? And how often have you wi&s;hed what you was taught to deny? Nay, can you help wi&s;hing for it at this moment? Do you not now earne&s;tly de&s;ire to cea&s;e from &s;in? to commit it no more? Does not your &s;oul pant after this glorious li|berty of the &s;ons of God? And what &s;trong rea&s;on have you to expect it? Have you not had a foreta&s;te of it already? Do you not remember the time when God fir&s;t lifted up the light of his countenance upon you? Can it ever be forgotten? the day when the can|dle of the Lord fir&s;t &s;hone upon your head? You then had power not to commit &s;in. You found the Apo&s;tle's words &s;trictly true, He that is begotten of God keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked one toucheth him not. But tho&s;e whom you took to be experienced Chri&s;tians, telling you, "this was the only time of your e&s;pou&s;als; this could not la&s;t always; you mu&s;t come down the mount," and the like, &s;hook your faith. You looked at men more than God, and &s;o became weak, and like another man; whereas, had you then had any to guide you according to the truth of God, had you then heard the doctrine which now you blame, you had never fallen from your &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s; but had found, that in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</P>
<P>Have you not another objection nearly allied to this, namely, that we preach perfection? True; but what perfection? The term you cannot object to, becau&s;e it is &s;criptural. All the difficulty is, to fix the meaning of it, according to the word of God: and this we have done again and again, declaring to all the world, that Chri&s;tian perfection does not imply an exemption from ignorance or mi&s;take, or infirmities, or temptations; but that it does imply, the being &s;o crucified with Chri&s;t, as to be able to te&s;tify, I live not, but Chri&s;t liveth in me (<HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 23.), and hath purified my heart
<PB N="289" REF="296">by faith (<HI>Acts</HI> xv. 9.). It does imply the ca&s;ting down every high thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the know|ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t. It does imply the being holy, as he that hath called us is holy in all manner of conver&s;ation (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 5. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 15.); and, in a word, the loving the Lord our God with all our heart, and &s;erving him with all our &s;trength.</P>
<P>Now, is it po&s;&s;ible for any one who believes the &s;cripture to deny one tittle of this? You cannot; you dare not; you would not for the world; you know it is the pure word of God: and this is the whole of what we preach; this is the height and depth of what we (with St. Paul) call perfection; a &s;tate of &s;oul de|voutly to be wi&s;hed, by all who have ta&s;ted of the love of God. O pray for it without cea&s;ing; it is the one thing you want. Come with boldne&s;s to the throne of grace, and be a&s;&s;ured, that when you a&s;k this of God, you &s;hall have the petition you a&s;k of him. We know indeed, that to man, to the natural man, this is im|po&s;&s;ible; but we know al&s;o, that as no work is impo&s;|&s;ible with God, &s;o all things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth.</P>
<P>For we are &s;aved by faith. But have you not heard this urged as another objection again&s;t us, That we preach &s;alvation by faith alone? And does not St. Paul do the &s;ame thing? By grace, &s;aith he, ye are &s;aved through faith. Can any words be more expre&s;s? And el&s;ewhere, Believe in the Lord Je&s;us, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 31.</P>
<P>What we mean by this (if it has not been &s;ufficiently explained already) is, that we are &s;aved from our &s;ins, only by a confidence in the love of God. As &s;oon as we behold what manner of love it is which the Father has be&s;towed upon us, we love him (as the Apo&s;tle ob|&s;erves) becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us; and then is that com|mandment written in our heart, that he who loveth God love his brother al&s;o; from which love of God
<PB N="290" REF="297">and man, meekne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, and all ho|ly tempers, &s;pring. Now the&s;e are the very e&s;&s;ence of &s;alvation, of Chri&s;tian &s;alvation, &s;alvation from &s;in; and from the&s;e outward &s;alvation flows, that is, ho|line&s;s of life and conver&s;ation. Well, and are not the&s;e things &s;o? If you know in whom you have be|lieved, you need no further witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But perhaps you doubt, whether that faith whereby we are thus &s;aved, implies &s;uch a tru&s;t and confidence in God as we de&s;cribe. "You cannot think faith im|plies a&s;&s;urance; an a&s;&s;urance of the love of God to our &s;ouls, of his being now reconciled to us, and having forgiven all our &s;ins." And this we freely confe&s;s, that if number of voices is to decide the que&s;tion, we mu&s;t give it up at once; for you have on your &s;ide, not only &s;ome who de&s;ire to be Chri&s;tians in deed, but all nominal Chri&s;tians in every place, and the Romi&s;h church, one and all. Nay, the&s;e la&s;t are &s;o vehement in your defence, that, in the famed council of Trent, they have decreed, "If any man hold <HI>(fiduciam)</HI> tru&s;t, confidence, or a&s;&s;urance of pardon, to be e&s;&s;ential to faith, let him be accur&s;ed."</P>
<P>Thus does that council anathemati&s;e the church of England; for &s;he is convict hereof, by her own con|fe&s;&s;ion. The very words in the homily on &s;alvation are, "Even the devils believe, that Chri&s;t was born of a virgin; that he wrought all kind of miracles, declaring him&s;elf very God; that for our &s;akes he &s;uf|fered a mo&s;t painful death, to redeem us from death everla&s;ting. The&s;e articles of our faith the devils be|lieve; and &s;o they believe all that was written in the Old and New Te&s;tament; and yet, for all this faith, they be but devils. They remain &s;till in their dam|nable e&s;tate, lacking the very true Chri&s;tian faith."</P>
<P>The right and true Chri&s;tian faith is, not only to believe the holy &s;criptures and the articles of our faith are true, but al&s;o to have a &s;ure tru&s;t and confidence to be &s;aved from everla&s;ting damnation through Chri&s;t;
<PB N="291" REF="298">or (as it is expre&s;&s;ed a little after) "a &s;ure tru&s;t and confidence which a man hath in God, that by the merits of Chri&s;t his &s;ins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God."</P>
<P>Indeed the Bi&s;hop of Rome &s;aith, "If any man hold this, let him be an Anathema Maran-atha." But it is to be hoped Papal anathemas do not move you. You are a member of the church of England. Are you? Then the controver&s;y is at an end. Then hear the church. Faith is a &s;ure tru&s;t which a man hath in God, that his &s;ins are forgiven. Or if you are not, whether you hear our church or no, at lea&s;t, hear the &s;criptures. Hear believing Job declaring his faith, I know that my Redeemer liveth. Hear Thomas (when having &s;een he believed) crying out, My Lord and my God. Hear St. Paul clearly de&s;cribing the nature of his faith, The life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me. Hear (to mention no more) all the believers who were with Paul when he wrote to the Colo&s;&s;ians, bearing witne&s;s, We give thanks unto the Father, who hath delivered us from the power of darkne&s;s, and hath tran&s;lated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, <HI>c.</HI> i. <HI>v.</HI> 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>But what need have we of di&s;tant witne&s;&s;es? You have a witne&s;s in your own brea&s;t. For am I not &s;peaking to one that loves God? How came you then to love him at fir&s;t? Was it not, becau&s;e you knew that he loved you? Did you, could you love God at all, till you ta&s;ted and &s;aw that he was gracious? that he was merciful to you a &s;inner? What avails then controver&s;y or &s;trife of words? out of thy own mouth! You own you had no love to God, till you was &s;en&s;i|ble of his love to you. And whatever expre&s;&s;ions any &s;inner who loves God u&s;es, to denote God's love to him, you will always, upon examination, find, that they directly or indirectly imply forgivene&s;s. Pardon|ing
<PB N="292" REF="299">love is &s;till at the root of all. He who was of|fended is now reconciled. The new &s;ong which God puts in every mouth, is always to that effect, O Lord, I will prai&s;e thee: though thou wa&s;t angry with me, thine anger is turned away. Behold, God is my &s;al|vation. I will tru&s;t and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my &s;trength and my &s;ong: he is al&s;o be|come my &s;alvation, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xii. 1, 2.</P>
<P>A confidence then in a pardoning God is e&s;&s;ential to true faith. The forgivene&s;s of &s;ins is one of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e un&s;een things, whereof faith is the evidence. And if you are &s;en&s;ible of this, will you quarrel with us concerning an indifferent circum&s;tance of it? Will you think it an important objection that we a&s;&s;ert, that this faith is u&s;ually given in a moment? Fir&s;t, let me intreat you to read over that authentic account of God's dealings with men, the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. In this treati&s;e you will find, how he wrought from the be|ginning on tho&s;e who received remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins by faith. And can you find one of the&s;e (except perhaps St. Paul) who did not receive it in a moment? But abun|dance you find of tho&s;e who did, be&s;ides Cornelius and the three thou&s;and. And to this al&s;o agrees the expe|rience of tho&s;e who now receive the heavenly gift. Three or four exceptions only have I found in the cour&s;e of &s;everal years. (Perhaps you your&s;elf may be added to that number, and one or two more whom you have known). But all the re&s;t of tho&s;e, who from time to time among us have believed in the Lord Je&s;us, were in a moment brought from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould it &s;eem a thing incredible to you, who have known the power of God unto &s;alvation (whether he hath wrought this in your &s;oul or no, for there are diver&s;ities of operations by the &s;ame &s;pirit), that the dead &s;hould hear the voice of the Son of God, and in that moment live? Thus he u&s;eth to act, to &s;hew, that when he willeth, to do is pre&s;ent with him.
<PB N="293" REF="300">Let there be light, &s;aid God, and there was light. He &s;pake the word, and it was done. Thus the heavens and the earth were created, and all the ho&s;ts of them. And this manner of acting in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, highly &s;uits both his power and love. There is therefore no hindrance on God's part; &s;ince, as his maje&s;ty is, &s;o is his mercy: and whatever hindrance there is on the part of man, when God &s;peaketh, it is not. Only a&s;k then, O &s;inner, and it &s;hall be given thee, even the faith that brings &s;alvation; and that without any me|rit or good work of thine; for it is not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t. No; it is of grace, of grace alone: for unto him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"But by talking thus you encourage &s;inners." I do encourage them &mdash; to repent; and do not you? Do not you know, how many heap &s;in upon &s;in, pure|ly for want of &s;uch encouragement? Becau&s;e they think "they can never be forgiven; there is no place for repentance le&s;t?" Does not your heart al&s;o bleed for them? What would you think too dear to part with? What would you not do, what would you not &s;uffer, to bring one &s;uch &s;inner to repentance? Could not your love endure all things for them? Yes &mdash; if you be|lieved it would do them good, if you had any hope they would ever be better." Why do you not believe it would do them good? Why have you not a hope that they will be better? Plainly, becau&s;e you do not love them enough; becau&s;e you have not that charity, which not only endureth, but at the &s;ame time believ|eth and hopeth all things.</P></Q>
<Q><P>You &s;till think we are &s;ecretly undermining, if not openly de&s;troying the church. What do you mean by the church? A vi&s;ible church (as our article defines it) is, a company of faithful (or believing) people: <HI>coetus credentium.</HI> This is the e&s;&s;ence of a church; and the properties thereof are (as they are de&s;cribed in the
<PB N="294" REF="301">words that follow) that the pure word of God be preach|ed therein, and the &s;acraments duly admini&s;tered. Now then (according to this authentic account) what is the church of England? What is it indeed, but the faith|ful people, the true believers of England? It is true, if the&s;e are &s;cattered abroad, they come under another con&s;ideration. But when they are vi&s;ibly joined, by a&s;&s;embling together to hear the pure word of God preached, and to eat of one bread, and drink of one cup, they are then properly the vi&s;ible church of Eng|land.</P>
<P>It were well if this were a little more con&s;idered by tho&s;e who &s;o vehemently cry out, The church! the church! (as tho&s;e of old, The temple of the Lord! the temple of the Lord!) not knowing what they &s;peak, nor whereof they affirm. A provincial or national church, according to our article, is, the true believers of that province or nation. If the&s;e are di&s;per&s;ed up and down, they are only a part of the invi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t: but if they are vi&s;ibly joined by a&s;&s;embling together to hear of his word and partake of his &s;upper, they are then a vi&s;ible church, &s;uch as the church of England, France, or any other.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, I a&s;k, how do we undermine or de&s;troy the church? the provincial, vi&s;ible church of England? The article mentions three things as e&s;|&s;ential to a vi&s;ible church: 1&s;t, Living faith, without which indeed there can be no church at all, neither vi&s;ible nor invi&s;ible; 2dly, Preaching (and con&s;equent|ly hearing) the pure word of God, el&s;e that faith would langui&s;h and die; and, 3dly, A due admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, the ordinary means whereby God in|crea&s;eth faith. Now come clo&s;e to the que&s;tion: in which of the&s;e points do we undermine or de&s;troy the church?</P>
<P>Do we &s;hut the door of faith? do we le&s;&s;en the num|ber of believing people in England? Only remember what faith is, according to our homilies (viz. "a &s;ure
<PB N="295" REF="302">tru&s;t and confidence in God, that through the merits of Chri&s;t my &s;ins are forgiven, and I reconciled to the favour of God,") and we appeal to all mankind, do we de&s;troy this faith, which is the life and &s;oul of the church? Is there, in fact, le&s;s of this faith in England than there was before we went forth? I think this is an a&s;&s;ertion which the father of lies him&s;elf will &s;carce dare to utter or maintain.</P>
<P>With regard then to this fir&s;t point, it is undeniable, we neither undermine nor de&s;troy the church. The &s;econd thing is, the preaching and hearing the pure word of God. And do we hinder this? Do we hin|der any mini&s;ter from preaching the pure word of God? If any preach not at all, or not the pure word of God, is the hindrance in us or in them&s;elves? Or, do we le&s;&s;en the number of tho&s;e that hear the pure word of God? Are then the hearers thereof (whether read or preached) fewer than they were in times pa&s;t? Are the u&s;ual places of public wor&s;hip le&s;s frequented by means of our preaching? Where&s;oever our lot has been ca&s;t for any time, are the churches emptier than they were before? Surely none that has any regard left either for truth or mode&s;ty, will &s;ay, that in this point we are enemies to, or de&s;troyers of, the church.</P>
<P>The third thing requi&s;ite (if not to the being, at lea&s;t) to the well-being of a church, is the due admini&s;tra|tion of the &s;acraments, particularly that of the Lord's &s;upper. And are we, in this re&s;pect, underminers or de&s;troyers of the church? Do we either by our exam|ple or advice draw men away from the Lord's table? Where we have laboured mo&s;t, are there the fewe&s;t communicants? How does the fact &s;tand in London, Bri&s;tol, Newca&s;tle? O that you would no longer &s;hut your eyes again&s;t the broad light, which encompa&s;&s;es you on every &s;ide!</P>
<P>I believe you are &s;en&s;ible by this time, not only how weak this objection is, but likewi&s;e how ea&s;y it would be, terribly to retort every branch of it upon mo&s;t of
<PB N="296" REF="303">tho&s;e that make it; whether we &s;peak of true living faith, of preaching the pure word of God, or of the due admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, both of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. But I &s;pare you. It &s;ufficeth that our God knoweth, and will make manife&s;t in that day, whether it be by rea&s;on of us or you that men ab|hor the offering of the Lord.</P>
<P>Others object, "That we do not ob&s;erve the laws of the church, and thereby undermine it." What laws? The rubrics or canons? In every pari&s;h where I have been curate yet, I have ob&s;erved the rubrics with a &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, not for wrath, but for con&s;ci|ence &s;ake: and this, &s;o far as belongs to an unbene|ficed mini&s;ter, or to a private member of the church, I do now. I will ju&s;t mention a few of them, and leave you to con&s;ider which of us has ob&s;erved or does ob&s;erve them mo&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Days of fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence to be ob&s;erved:
<LIST>
<ITEM>The forty days of Lent,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Ember-days at the four &s;ea&s;ons,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The three rogation-days,</ITEM>
<ITEM>All Fridays in the year, except Chri&s;tmas day.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="2">2. So many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion, &s;hall &s;ignify their names to the curate, at lea&s;t &s;ome time the day before:</P>
<P>And if any of the&s;e be an open and notorious evil liver,&mdash;the curate &s;hall adverti&s;e him, that in any wi&s;e he pre&s;ume not to come to the Lord's table until he hath openly declared him&s;elf to have truly repented.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then (after the Nicene creed) the curate &s;hall declare unto the people what holydays or fa&s;ting-days are in the week following to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="4">4. The mini&s;ter &s;hall fir&s;t receive the communion in both kinds him&s;elf, and then proceed to deliver the &s;ame to the bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons, in like man|ner, if any be pre&s;ent, and after that, to the people.</P>
<P N="5">5. In cathedral and collegiate churches, and col|leges, where there are many prie&s;ts and deacons, they
<PB N="297" REF="304">&s;hall always receive the communion with the prie&s;t, every Sunday at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. The children to be bapti&s;ed mu&s;t be ready at the font, immediately after the la&s;t le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P N="7">7. The curates of every pari&s;h &s;hall warn the people, that, without great nece&s;&s;ity, they procure not their children to be bapti&s;ed at home is their hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="8">8. The curate of every pari&s;h &s;hall diligently, upon Sundays and holydays, after the &s;econd le&s;&s;on at even|ing prayer, openly in the church, in&s;truct and examine &s;o many children as he &s;hall think convenient in &s;ome part of the Catechi&s;m.</P>
<P N="9">9. When&s;oever the Bi&s;hop &s;hall give notice for children to be brought unto him for their confirmation, the curate of every pari&s;h &s;hall either bring or &s;end in writing, with his hand &s;ub&s;cribed thereunto, the names of all &s;uch per&s;ons within his pari&s;h as he &s;hall think fit to be pre&s;ented to the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Now the que&s;tion is not, Whether the&s;e rubrics ought to be ob&s;erved (you take this for granted in making the objection) but whether in fact they have been ob&s;erved, by you or me, mo&s;t? Many can wit|ne&s;s, I have ob&s;erved them punctually, yea, &s;ometimes at the hazard of my life: and as many, I fear, that you have not ob&s;erved them at all, and that &s;everal of them you never pretended to ob&s;erve. And is it you that are accu&s;ing me, for not ob&s;erving the rubrics of the church? What grimace is this! "O tell it not in Gath! publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon!"</P>
<P>With regard to the canons, I would in the fir&s;t place de&s;ire you to con&s;ider two or three plain que&s;tions.</P>
<P>1&s;t, Have you ever read them over?</P>
<P>2dly, How can the&s;e be called "the canons of the church of England?" &s;eeing they were never legally e&s;tabli&s;hed by the church? never regularly confirmed in full convocation?</P>
<P>3dly, By what right am I required to ob&s;erve &s;uch canons as were never legally e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="305">And then I will join i&s;&s;ue with you in one que&s;tion more, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether you or I have ob&s;erved them mo&s;t?</P>
<P>To in&s;tance only a few.</P>

<P>Now let the clergyman who has ob&s;erved only the&s;e five canons for one year la&s;t pa&s;t, and who has read over all the canons in his congregation; (as the King's ratification &s;traitly enjoins him to do once every year) let him, I &s;ay, ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone at us, for not ob|&s;erving the canons (&s;o called) of the church of England.</P>
<P>However we cannot be (it is &s;aid) friends to the church, becau&s;e we do not obey the governors of it, and &s;ubmit our&s;elves (as at our ordination we promi&s;ed to do) to all their godly admonitions and injunctions. I an&s;wer, in every individual point of an indifferent nature. We do and will (by the grace of God) obey the governors of the church: but the te&s;tifying the go&s;pel of the grace of God, is not a point of an indif|ferent nature. The mini&s;try which we have received of the Lord Je&s;us, we are at all hazards to fulfil. It is the burthen of the Lord which is laid upon us here; and we are to obey God rather than man. Nor yet do
<PB N="299" REF="306">we in any ways violate the promi&s;e which each of us made, when it was &s;aid unto him, "Take thou au|thority to preach the word of God, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t." We then promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit (mark the words) to the godly admonitions and injunctions of our ordinary. But we did not, could not promi&s;e to obey &s;uch injunctions, as we know are contrary to the word of God.</P>
<P>But why then, &s;ay &s;ome, do ye leave the church? Leave the church! what can you mean? do we leave &s;o much as the church-walls? your own eyes tell you, we do not. Do we leave the ordinances of the church? you daily &s;ee and know the contrary. Do we leave the fundamental doctrine of the church, namely, &s;alva|tion by faith? It is our con&s;tant theme, in public, in private, in writing, in conver&s;ation. Do we leave the practice of the church, the &s;tandard whereof are the ten commandments? which are &s;o e&s;&s;entially inwrought in her con&s;titution (as little as you may apprehend it) that who&s;oever breaks one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, is no member of the church of England. I believe you do not care to put the cau&s;e on this i&s;&s;ue. Neither do you mean this, by leaving the church. In truth, I cannot conceive what you mean. I doubt you cannot conceive your&s;elf. You have retailed a &s;entence from &s;ome|body el&s;e, which you no more under&s;tand than he.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley then takes a retro&s;pective view of the &s;tate of religion before the Methodi&s;t doctrines were preached, and the happy change produced thereby, in the follow|ing words:</P>
<Q><P>Before I conclude, I cannot but intreat you who know God, to review the whole matter from the foun|dation. Call to mind what the &s;tate of religion was, in our nation, a few years &s;ince. In whom did you find the holy tempers that were in Chri&s;t? Bowels of mercies, lowline&s;s, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, contempt of the world, patience, temperance, long-&s;uffering? A burning love to God, rejoicing evermore, and in every
<PB N="300" REF="307">thing giving thanks; and a tender love to all mankind, covering, believing, hoping, enduring all things? Per|haps you did not know one &s;uch man in the world. But how many, that had all unholy tempers? What vanity and pride, what &s;tubbornne&s;s and &s;elf will, what anger, fretfulne&s;s, di&s;content, what &s;u&s;picion and re|&s;entment, what inordinate affections, what irregular pa&s;&s;ions, what fooli&s;h and hurtful de&s;ires might you find in tho&s;e who were called the be&s;t of men? in tho&s;e who made the &s;tricte&s;t profe&s;&s;ion of religion? and how few did you know who went &s;o far as the profe&s;|&s;ion of religion, who had even the form of godline&s;s? Did you not frequently bewail, wherever your lot was ca&s;t, the general want of even outward religion? how few were &s;een at the public wor&s;hip of God? how much fewer at the Lord's table? and was even this little flock zealous of good works, careful, as they had time, to do good to all men? On the other hand, did you not with grief ob&s;erve, outward irreligion in every place? Where could you be for one week, without be|ing an eye or an ear witne&s;s, of cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, or prophanene&s;s, of &s;abbath-breaking or drunkenne&s;s, of quarrelling or brawling, of revenge or ob&s;cenity? Were the&s;e things done in a corner? did not gro&s;s iniquity of all kinds over&s;pread our land as a flood? yea, and daily increa&s;e, in &s;pite of all the oppo&s;ition which the children of God did or could make again&s;t it?</P>
<P>If you had been then told, that the jealous God would &s;oon ari&s;e and maintain his own cau&s;e; that he would pour down his &s;pirit from on high, and renew the face of the earth; that he would &s;hed abroad his love in the hearts of the outca&s;ts of men, producing all holy and heavenly tempers, expelling anger, and pride, and evil de&s;ire, and all unholy and earthly tempers; cau&s;ing outward religion, the work of faith, the pa|tience of hope, the labour of love, to flouri&s;h and abound; and wherever it &s;pread, aboli&s;hing outward irreligion, de&s;troying all the works of the devil: if
<PB N="301" REF="308">you had been told, that this living knowledge of the Lord would in a &s;hort &s;pace over&s;pread our land; yea, and daily increa&s;e, in &s;pite of all the oppo&s;ition which the devil and his children did or could make again&s;t it: would you not vehemently have de&s;ired to &s;ee that day, that you might ble&s;s God and rejoice therein?</P>
<P>Behold the day of the Lord is come. He is again vi&s;iting and redeeming his people. Having eyes, &s;ee ye not? having ears, do ye not hear? neither under|&s;tand with your hearts? At this hour the Lord is roll|ing away our reproach. Already his &s;tandard is &s;et up. His &s;pirit is poured forth on the outca&s;ts of men, and his love &s;hed abroad in their hearts. Love of all mankind, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, holy and heavenly affections, do take place of hate, anger, pride, revenge, and vile or vain affections. Hence wherever the power of the Lord &s;preads, &s;prings outward religion in all its forms. The hou&s;es of God are filled; the table of the Lord is thronged on every &s;ide: and tho&s;e who thus &s;hew their love of God, &s;hew they love their neighbour al&s;o, by being careful to maintain good works, by doing all manner of good (as they have time) to all men. They are likewi&s;e careful to ab&s;tain from all evil. Cur&s;ing, &s;abbath-breaking, drunkenne&s;s, with all other (however fa&s;hi|onable) works of the devil, are not once named among them. All this is plain, demon&s;trable fact. For this al&s;o is not done in a corner. Now, do you acknow|ledge the day of your vi&s;itation? do you ble&s;s God and rejoice therein?</P>
<P>What hinders? Is it this, that men &s;ay all manner of evil of tho&s;e whom God is plea&s;ed to u&s;e as in&s;tru|ments in his works? O ye fools, did ye &s;uppo&s;e the devil was dead? or that he would not fight for his kingdom? and what weapons &s;hall he fight with if not with lies? Is he not a liar, and the father of it? Suffer ye then thus far. Let the devil and his children &s;ay all manner of evil of us; and let them go on deceiving
<PB N="302" REF="309">each other, and being deceived: but ye need not be deceived al&s;o. Or if you are, if you will believe all they &s;ay: be it &s;o, that we are weak, &s;illy, wicked men; without &s;en&s;e, without learning, without even a de&s;ire or de&s;ign of doing good: yet I in&s;i&s;t upon the fact. Chri&s;t is preached, and &s;inners are converted to God. This none but a madman can deny. We are ready to prove it by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es. Neither therefore can the inference be denied, that God is now vi&s;iting his people. O that all men may know in this their day, the things that make for their peace!</P></Q>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley, in his <HI>Farther Appeal,</HI> thus an&s;wers the charge of enthu&s;ia&s;m brought again&s;t the Me|thodi&s;ts:</P>
<Q><P>I a&s;&s;ert, that till a man receives the Holy Gho&s;t, he is without God in the world; that he cannot know the things of God, unle&s;s God reveal them unto him by his Spirit: no, nor have even one holy or heavenly temper, without the in&s;piration of the Holy One." Now &s;hould one who is con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he has experienced none of the&s;e things, attempt to con|fute the&s;e propo&s;itions, either from &s;cripture or anti|quity, it might prove a difficult ta&s;k. What then &s;hall he do? Why, cry out, "Enthu&s;ia&s;m! Enthu|&s;ia&s;m!" and the work is done.</P>
<P>But what does he mean by <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m?</HI> Perhaps no|thing at all: few have any di&s;tinct idea of its mean|ing. Perhaps, "&s;omething very bad," or, "&s;ome|thing I never experienced and do not under&s;tand." Shall I tell you then, what that "terrible &s;omething" is? I believe, thinking men mean by enthu&s;ia&s;m, a &s;ort of religious madne&s;s; a fal&s;e imagination of being in&s;pired by God; and by an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, one that fan|cies him&s;elf under the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, when in fact he is not.</P>
<P>Let him prove me guilty of this, who can. I will tell you once more the whole of my belief on the&s;e heads:
<PB N="303" REF="310">and if any man will &s;hew me (by arguments, not hard names) what is wrong, I will thank God and him.</P>
<P>Every good gift is from God, and is given to man by the Holy Gho&s;t. By nature there is in us no good thing; and there can be none, but &s;o far as it is wrought in us by that good &s;pirit. Have we any true knowledge of what is good? This is not the re&s;ult of our natural under&s;tanding. The natural man di&s;cerneth not the things of the &s;pirit of God: &s;o that we never can di&s;cern them, until God reveals them unto us by his &s;pirit: reveals, that is, unveils, uncovers; gives us to know what we did not know before. Have we love? It is &s;hed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given unto us. He in&s;pires, breathes, in|fu&s;es into our &s;oul, what of our&s;elves we could not have. Does our &s;pirit rejoice in God our Saviour? It is joy in (or by) the Holy Gho&s;t. Have we true in|ward peace? It is the peace of God, wrought in us by the &s;ame &s;pirit. Faith, peace, joy, love, are all his fruits: and, as we are figuratively &s;aid to &s;ee the light of faith, &s;o by a like figure of &s;peech we are &s;aid to feel this peace and joy and love: that is, we have an inward experience of them, which we cannot find any fitter word to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why in &s;peaking of the&s;e things I u&s;e tho&s;e terms (<HI>in&s;piration</HI> particularly) are, 1. Becau&s;e they are &s;criptural. 2. Becau&s;e they are u&s;ed by our church. 3. Becau&s;e I know none better. The word "Influence of the Holy Gho&s;t," which I &s;uppo&s;e you u&s;e, is both a far &s;tronger and a le&s;s natural term than in&s;piration. It is far &s;tronger, even as far as "flow|ing into the &s;oul" is a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion than "breath|ing upon it:" and le&s;s natural; as breathing bears a near relation to &s;pirit; to which flowing in has only a di&s;|tant relation.</P>
<P>"But you thought I had meant immediate in&s;pira|tion." So I do, or I mean nothing at all. Nor in|deed &s;uch in&s;piration as is <HI>&s;ine mediis.</HI> But all in&s;pira|tion,
<PB N="304" REF="311">tho' by means, is immediate. Suppo&s;e, for in|&s;tance, you are employed in private prayer, and God pours his love into your heart. God then acts imme|diately on your &s;oul: and the love of him which you then experience, is as immediately breathed into you by the Holy Gho&s;t, as if you had lived 1700 years ago. Change the term. Say, God then a&s;&s;i&s;ts you to love him?" Well, and is not this immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Say, "His &s;pirit concurs with yours." You gain no ground. It is immediate concurrence or none at all. God a &s;pirit acts upon your &s;pirit. Make it out any otherwi&s;e if you can.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive how that harmle&s;s word <HI>imme|diate</HI> came to be &s;uch a bugbear in the world: "Why, I thought you meant &s;uch in&s;piration as the Apo&s;tles had: and &s;uch a receiving the Holy Gho&s;t as that was at the day of Penteco&s;t." I do, in part: indeed I do not mean, that Chri&s;tians now receive the Holy Gho&s;t in order to work miracles; but they do doubtle&s;s now receive, yea, are filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, in order to be filled with the fruits of that ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit. And he in&s;pires into all true believers now, a degree of the &s;ame peace and joy and love, which the Apo&s;tles felt in them&s;elves on that day, when they were fir&s;t filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered the mo&s;t material objections I know, which have been lately made again&s;t the great doctrines I teach. I have produced, &s;o far as in me lay, the &s;trength of tho&s;e objections, and then an&s;wered them, I hope, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s. And now I tru&s;t it appears, that the&s;e doctrines are no other than the doctrines of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: that they are all evident|ly contained in the word of God, by which alone I de|&s;ire to &s;tand or fall; and that they are fundamentally the &s;ame with the doctrines of the church of England, of which I do, and ever did profe&s;s my&s;elf a member.</P></Q>
<P>By the&s;e extracts my readers will &s;ee the principles of the&s;e hone&s;t (if mi&s;taken) people, and will come to
<PB N="305" REF="312">&s;uch conclu&s;ion as his rea&s;on and under&s;tanding will afford him. It will not be expected of me to give my opinion; it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an hi&s;torian to relate facts, and not to comment upon them, particularly in ca&s;es where religion is the concern, and in which, I think, every man has a natural right to follow the determina|tions of his own judgment: but before I give a brief hi&s;tory of their ri&s;e, &amp;c. after this recapitulation of their principles and doctrines, I &s;hall &s;et before my readers what they &s;ay in an&s;wer to one or two of the mo&s;t popular objections or calumnies rai&s;ed again&s;t them; the fir&s;t of which is, "That they create divi|&s;ions in private families." Their able Apologi&s;t
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Farther Appeal, p. 91.</NOTE> thus refutes it. "Accidentally, we do. For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e an entire family to have the form but not the power of godline&s;s, or to have neither the form nor the power; in either ca&s;e, they may in &s;ome &s;ort agree together. But &s;uppo&s;e, when the&s;e hear the plain word of God, one or two of them are convinced, "This is the truth; and I have been all this time in the broad way that leadeth to de&s;truction:" the&s;e then will begin to mourn after God, while the re&s;t remain as they were. Will they not therefore of con&s;equence divide, and form them&s;elves into &s;eparate parties? Mu&s;t it not be &s;o, in the very nature of things? and how exactly does this agree with the words of our Lord? "Suppo&s;e ye that I came to &s;end peace upon earth? I tell you nay: but rather divi&s;ion. For from henceforth there &s;hall be five divided in one hou&s;e, three again&s;t two, and two again&s;t three. The father &s;hall be divided again&s;t the &s;on, and the &s;on again&s;t the father: the mother again&s;t her daughter, and the daughter again&s;t the mother: the mother-in-law again&s;t the daughter|in-law, and the daughter-in-law again&s;t the mother-in|law. (Luke xii. 51, 52, 53.) And the foes of a man, &s;hall be they of his own hou&s;hold. (Matt. x. 36.)</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="313">Thus it was from the very beginning. For is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a Heathen parent would long endure a Chri&s;tian child? or that a Heathen hu&s;band would agree with a Chri&s;tian wife? unle&s;s either the believing wife could gain her hu&s;band; or the unbelieving hu&s;|band prevailed on the wife to renounce her way of wor|&s;hipping God: at lea&s;t, unle&s;s &s;he would obey him in going no more to tho&s;e <HI>&s;ocieties</HI> or <HI>conventicles,</HI> as they termed the Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Do you think now, I have an eye to your ca&s;e? Doubtle&s;s I have; for I do not fight as one that beateth the air. Why have not I a right to hinder my own wife or child from going to a conventicle? and is it not the duty of wives to obey their hu&s;bands? and of children to obey their parents?" Only &s;et the ca&s;e &s;e|venteen hundred years back, and your own con&s;cience gives you the an&s;wer. What would St. Paul have &s;aid to one who&s;e hu&s;band forbad her, to follow this way any more? What direction would our Saviour have given to him, who&s;e father enjoined him, not to hear the go&s;pel? His words are extant &s;till, "He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that loveth &s;on or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me." Matt. x. 37, 38. Nay more, "If any man cometh to me, and hateth not (in compari&s;on of me) his father and mother, and wife and children, yea and his own life, he cannot be my di&s;|ciple." Luke xiv. 26.</P>
<P>O, but this is not a parallel ca&s;e; for they were Heathens; but I am a Chri&s;tian." A Chri&s;tian! Are you &s;o? Do you under&s;tand the word? Do you know what a Chri&s;tian is? If you are a Chri&s;tian, you have the mind that was in Chri&s;t; and you &s;o walk as he al&s;o walked. You are holy, as he is holy both in heart and in all manner of conver&s;ation. Have you then the mind that was in Chri&s;t? and do you walk as Chri&s;t walked? are you inwardly and outwardly holy? I &s;ear, not even outwardly. No; you live in known
<PB N="307" REF="314">&s;in. Alas! how then are you a Chri&s;tian? What a railer, a Chri&s;tian? a common &s;wearer, a Chri&s;tian? a &s;abbath-breaker, a Chri&s;tian? a drunkard or whore|monger, a Chri&s;tian? Thou art a Heathen barefaced? the wrath of God is on thy head, and the cur&s;e of God upon thy back. Thy damnation &s;lumbereth not. By rea&s;on of &s;uch Chri&s;tians it is that the holy name of Chri&s;t is bla&s;phemed. Such as thou they are, that cau&s;e the very &s;avages in the Indian woods to cry out, "Chri&s;tian much drunk, Chri&s;tian beat men, Chri&s;tian tell lies, Devil-Chri&s;tian! me no Chri&s;tian."</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved above, that the Methodi&s;ts do not &s;eparate from the church, nor
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Farther Appeal, Part iii. p. 234.</NOTE> di&s;pute about the externals or circum&s;tantials of religion; they approve of and adhere to them, all that they learned when they were children, in their Catechi&s;m and Common Prayer book. They were born and bred up in the church of England, and de&s;ire to die therein. They always were, and now are (they &s;ay) zealous for the church; only not with a blind zeal. They do not, indeed, lay the main &s;tre&s;s of their religion, on any opinions, right or wrong; neither do they ever begin, or willingly join, in any di&s;pute concerning them. The weight of all religion, they apprehend, re&s;ts on holine&s;s of heart and life; and, con&s;equently, wherever they come, they pre&s;s this with all their might. How wide then is their ca&s;e from that of the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in general? <HI>They</HI> avowedly &s;eparated from the church: the Me|thodi&s;ts utterly di&s;avow any &s;uch de&s;ign. <HI>They</HI> &s;everely, and almo&s;t continually, inveighed again&s;t the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church they left: the&s;e approve both the doctrines and di&s;cipline of our church, and inveigh only again&s;t ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>They</HI> &s;pent great part of their time and &s;trength in con|tending about externals and circum&s;tantials: the Me|thodi&s;ts agree with the church of England in both; &s;o
<PB N="308" REF="315">that having no time to &s;pend in &s;uch vain contention, they have their de&s;ire in &s;pending and being &s;pent, in promoting plain practical religion. "I am &s;ick, &s;ays Mr. We&s;ley, of <HI>opinions:</HI> I am weary to bear them: my &s;oul loaths this frothy food. Give me &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial religion: give me an humble, gentle lover of God and man: a man full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri&s;y: a man, lay|ing him&s;elf out in the work of faith, the patience of hope, the labour of love.

<P>With regard to the charges of making men idle, and thereby beggaring their families, and of driving men out of their &s;en&s;es, Mr. We&s;ley thus an&s;wers: "This objection having been continually urged for &s;ome years, I will trace it from the foundation. Two or three years after my return from America, one Captain Robert Williams of Bri&s;tol made affidavit be|fore the (then) Mayor of the city, that "it was a com|mon report in Georgia, Mr. We&s;ley took people off from their work, and made them idle, by preaching &s;o much."</P>
<P>The fact &s;tood thus: At my fir&s;t coming to Savan|nah, the generality of the people ro&s;e at &s;even or eight in the morning; and that part of them who were accu&s;tomed to work, u&s;ually worked till &s;ix in the evening. A few of them &s;ometimes worked till &s;even; which is the time of &s;un-&s;et there at Mid-&s;ummer.</P>
<P>I immediately began reading prayers and expound|ing the &s;econd le&s;&s;on, both in the morning and even|ing. The morning &s;ervice began at five, and ended at, or before &s;ix: the evening-&s;ervice began at &s;even. Now &s;uppo&s;ing all the grown per&s;ons in the town had been pre&s;ent every morning and evening, would this have
<PB N="309" REF="316">made them idle? Would they hereby have had le&s;s, or con&s;iderably more time for working? The &s;ame rule I follow now, both at London, Bri&s;tol, and Newca&s;tle|upon-Tyne: concluding the &s;ervice at every place, winter and &s;ummer, before &s;ix in the morning, and not ordinarily beginning to preach till near &s;even in the evening. Now do you, who make this objection, work longer, throughout the year, than from &s;ix to &s;ix? Do you de&s;ire that the generality of people &s;hould? Or, can you count them idle, that work &s;o long? Some few are indeed accu&s;tomed to work longer. The&s;e I advi&s;e not to come on week-days: and it is apparent that they take this advice, unle&s;s on &s;ome rare and extraordinary occa&s;ion. But I hope, none of you who turn them out of their employment, have the confidence to talk of my making them idle! Do you (as the homely phra&s;e is) cry Wh&mdash; fir&s;t? I admire your cunning, but not your mode&s;ty. So far am I from either cau&s;ing or encouraging idlene&s;s, that an idle per&s;on, known to be &s;uch, is not &s;uffered to re|main in any of our &s;ocieties; we drive him out, as we would a thief or a murderer. "To &s;hew all po&s;&s;ible diligence," (as well as frugality) is one of our &s;tanding rules: and one, concerning the ob&s;ervance of which, we continually make the &s;tricte&s;t inquiry.</P>
<P>"But you drive them out of their &s;en&s;es. You <HI>make them run mad.</HI>" Nay, then they are idle with a vengeance. This objection therefore being of the ut|mo&s;t importance, de&s;erves our deepe&s;t con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, I grant, it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire to drive all the world into what you probably call <HI>madne&s;s:</HI> (I mean inward religion) to make them ju&s;t as <HI>mad</HI> as Paul was when he was &s;o accounted by Fe&s;tus. I grant, &s;econdly, it is my endeavour to drive all I can into what you may term another &s;pecies of madne&s;s, which is u&s;ually preparatory to this, and which I term repentance or conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="317">Now, what if your wife, or daughter, or acquain|taince, after hearing one of the&s;e field-preachers, &s;hould come and tell you, that they &s;aw damnation before them, and beheld with the eye of their mind the horror of hell? What if they &s;hould tremble and quake, and be &s;o taken up, partly with &s;orrow and heavine&s;s, partly with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, as to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour to &s;hew them&s;elves weary of life? Would you &s;cruple to &s;ay, that they were &s;tark mad? that the&s;e fellows had driven them out of their &s;en&s;es? and that whatever writer it was, that talked at this rate, he was fitter for Bed|lam than any other place?</P>
<P>You have over&s;hot your&s;elf now to &s;ome purpo&s;e. The&s;e are the very words of our own church. You may read them, if you are &s;o inclined, in the fir&s;t part of the homily on fa&s;ting. And, con&s;equently, what you have peremptorily determined to be mere lunacy and di&s;traction, is that repentance unto life, which, in the judgment both of the church and of St. Paul, is never to be repented of.</P>
<P>I grant, thirdly, that extraordinary circum&s;tances have attended this conviction in &s;ome in&s;tances. A particular account of the&s;e I have frequently given. While the word of God was preached, &s;ome per&s;ons have dropped down as dead; &s;ome have been, as it were, in &s;trong convul&s;ions; &s;ome roared aloud, tho' not with an articulate voice; and others &s;poke the angui&s;h of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>This, I &s;uppo&s;e, you believe to be perfect madne&s;s: but it is ea&s;ily accounted for, either on principles of rea&s;on or &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, on principles of rea&s;on. For how ea&s;y is it to &s;uppo&s;e, that a &s;trong, lively, and &s;udden apprehen&s;ion of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, the wrath of God, and the bitter pains of eternal death, &s;hould affect the body as well as the &s;oul, during the pre&s;ent laws of vital union;
<PB N="311" REF="318">&s;hould interrupt or di&s;turb the ordinary circulations, and put nature out of its cour&s;e? Yea, we may que&s;ti|on, whether while this union &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, it be po&s;&s;ible for the mind to be affected, in &s;o violent a degree, with|out &s;ome or other of tho&s;e bodily &s;ymptoms following?</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e ea&s;y to account for the&s;e things, on principles of &s;cripture. For when we take a view of them in this light, we are to add to the con&s;ideration of natural cau&s;es, the agency of tho&s;e &s;pirits who &s;till excel in natural &s;trength, and as far as they have leave from God, will not fail to torment whom they cannot de&s;troy; to tear tho&s;e that are coming to Chri&s;t. It is al&s;o remarkable, that there is plain &s;cripture-prece|dent of every &s;ymptom which has lately appeared. So that we cannot allow even the conviction attended with the&s;e to be madne&s;s, without giving up both rea&s;on and &s;cripture.</P>
<P>I grant, fourthly, that touches of extravagance, bor|dering on madne&s;s, may &s;ometimes attend &s;evere con|viction. And this al&s;o is ea&s;y to be accounted for, by the pre&s;ent laws of the animal oeconomy. For we know, fear or grief, from a temporary cau&s;e, may oc|ca&s;ion a fever, and thereby a delirium.</P>
<P>It is not &s;trange then that &s;ome, while under &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of grief or fear, from a &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God, &s;hould for a &s;ea&s;on forget almo&s;t all things el&s;e, and &s;carce be able to an&s;wer a common que&s;tion: that &s;ome &s;hould fancy they &s;ee the flames of hell, or the devil and his angels around them: or that others, for a &s;pace, &s;hould be afraid, like Cain, who&s;oever meeteth me will &s;lay me. All the&s;e, and whatever le&s;s common effects may &s;ometimes accompany this convic|tion, are ea&s;ily known from the natural di&s;temper of madne&s;s, were it only by this one circum&s;tance, that whenever the per&s;on convinced ta&s;tes the pardoning love of God, they all vani&s;h away in a moment.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I have &s;een one in&s;tance (I pray God I may &s;ee no more &s;uch!) of real la&s;ting madne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="319">Two or three years &s;ince, I took one with me to Bri&s;tol, who was under deep convictions, but of as &s;ound an under&s;tanding in all re&s;pects as ever he had been in his life. I went a &s;hort journey, and when I came to Bri&s;tol again, found him really di&s;tracted. I inquired particularly, at what time and place, and in what manner this di&s;order began? And I believe there are at lea&s;t three&s;core witne&s;&s;es alive, and ready to te&s;ti|fy what follows. When I went from Bri&s;tol, he con|tracted an acquaintance with &s;ome per&s;ons, who were not of the &s;ame judgment with me. He was &s;oon pre|judiced again&s;t me. Quickly after, when our &s;ociety were met together in King&s;wood-Hou&s;e, he began a vehement invective both again&s;t my per&s;on and doc|trines. In the mid&s;t of this, he was &s;truck raving mad; and &s;o he continued till his friends put him into Bedlam, and, probably, laid his madne&s;s too to my charge.</P>
<P>I fear there may al&s;o be &s;ome in&s;tances of real mad|ne&s;s, proceeding from a different cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a per&s;on hearing me is &s;trong|ly convinced, that a liar cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven: he comes home, and relates this to his pa|rents or friends, and appears to be very unea&s;y. The&s;e good Chri&s;tians are di&s;turbed at this, and afraid he is running mad too. They are re&s;olved he &s;hall never hear any of tho&s;e fellows more, and keep to it in &s;pite of all his intreaties. They will not &s;uffer him, when at home, to be alone, for fear he &s;hould read or pray; and perhaps in a while they will con&s;train him, at lea&s;t by repeated importunities, to do again the very thing for which he was convinced the wrath of God cometh upon the children of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>What is the event of this? Sometimes the &s;pirit of God is quenched, and departs from him. Now you have carried the point. The man is as ea&s;y as ever, and &s;ins on without any remor&s;e. But in other in&s;tan|ces, where tho&s;e convictions &s;ink deep, and the arrows
<PB N="313" REF="320">of the Almighty &s;tick fa&s;t in the &s;oul, you will drive that per&s;on into real &s;ettled madne&s;s, before you can quench the &s;pirit of God. I am afraid there have been &s;everal in&s;tances of this. You have forced the man's con&s;cience, till he is &s;tark-mad: but then, pray do not impute that madne&s;s to me. Had you left him to my direction, or rather to the direction of the Spirit of God, he would have been filled with love and a found mind: but you have taken the matter out of God's hand. And now you have brought it to a fair conclu&s;ion!</P>
<P>How frequent this ca&s;e may be, I know not. But doubtle&s;s mo&s;t of tho&s;e who make this objection, of our driving men mad, have never met with &s;uch an in&s;tance in their lives. The common cry is occa&s;ion|ed, either by tho&s;e who are convinced of &s;in, or tho&s;e who are inwardly converted to God; mere madne&s;s both (as was ob&s;erved before) to tho&s;e who are with|out God in the world. Yet I do not deny but you may have &s;een one in Bedlam who &s;aid he had follow|ed me. But ob&s;erve, a madman's &s;aying this is no proof of the fact; nay, and if he really had, it &s;hould be farther con&s;idered, that his being in Bedlam is no &s;ure proof of his being mad. Witne&s;s the well-known ca&s;e of Mr. Periam; and I doubt more &s;uch are to be found. Yea, it is well if &s;ome have not been &s;ent thi|ther, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they followed me; their kind relations either concluding, that they mu&s;t be di&s;tracted before they could do this, or perhaps ho|ping, that Bedlam would make them mad, if it did not find them &s;o.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be owned, a confinement of &s;uch a &s;ort is as fit to cau&s;e as to cure di&s;traction; for what &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s is to be compared to it? To be &s;eparated at once from all who are near and dear to you; to be cut off from all rea&s;onable conver&s;ation, to be &s;ecluded from all bu&s;ine&s;s, from all reading, from every innocent en|tertainment of the mind, which is left to prey wholly upon it&s;elf, and day and night to pore over your mi&s;|fortunes;
<PB N="314" REF="321">fortunes; to be &s;hut up day by day in a gloomy cell, with only the walls to employ your heavy eyes, in the mid&s;t either of melancholy &s;ilence, or horrid cries, groans, and laughter intermixed; to be forced by the main &s;trength of tho&s;e "who laugh at human nature and compa&s;&s;ion;" to take drenches of nau&s;eous, per|haps torturing medicines, which you know you have no need of now, but know not how &s;oon you may, po&s;&s;ibly by the operation of the&s;e very drugs on a weak or tender con&s;titution. Here is di&s;tre&s;s! It is an a&s;to|ni&s;hing thing, a &s;ignal proof of the power of God, if any creature who has his &s;en&s;es when that confinement begins, does not lo&s;e them before it is at an end!</P>
<P>How mu&s;t it heighten the di&s;tre&s;s, if &s;uch a poor wretch, being deeply convinced of &s;in, and growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e (as he probably will, &s;eeing there is no medicine here for his &s;ickne&s;s, no &s;uch phy&s;ician as his ca&s;e requires), be &s;oon placed among the incura|bles! Can imagination it&s;elf paint &s;uch a hell upon earth? where even "hope never comes, that comes to all!"&mdash;For what remedy? If a man of &s;en&s;e and huma|nity &s;hould happen to vi&s;it that hou&s;e of woe, would he give the hearing to a madman's tale? or if he did, would he credit it? "Do we not know, might he &s;ay, how well any of the&s;e will talk in their lucid intervals?" So that a thou&s;and to one he would concern him&s;elf no more about it, but leave the weary to wait for re&s;t in the grave!"</P>
<P>The fir&s;t public appearance of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, of Pembroke college, Oxford, who was an ordained clergyman of the church of England, about London, was in the year 1739, when he and his a&s;|&s;ociates preached up and down in the fields to va&s;t mul|titudes of people, with an energy that &s;truck every one, particularly in Moorfields, on Kennington Com|mon, Blackheath, &amp;c. and for &s;ome time they were admitted al&s;o into the churches to declare their pecu|liar opinions, till the indolent clergy were rou&s;ed by
<PB N="315" REF="322">their extraordinary popularity; and the church-wardens fearing damages to their pews, &amp;c. &amp;c. they were ge|nerally refu&s;ed the u&s;e of the public pulpits. The un|common fervour they expre&s;&s;ed, a &s;imple yet per&s;ua|&s;ive eloquence, and the mortified and laborious life they led, procured them not only mo&s;t numerous au|ditors, but their doctrines &s;uch a multitude of follow|ers, as a&s;toni&s;hed the guardians of our church: but whil&s;t they them&s;elves indolently per&s;i&s;ted in their old rout of &s;tated preaching, Mr. Whitefield, particularly, with a rapid progre&s;s, took from them thou&s;ands of their hearers, particularly of the lower &s;ort, and brought many more to a &s;en&s;e and abhorrence of their vices, and to attend his preaching, who, perhaps, had ne|ver been at any kind of wor&s;hip before. Whil&s;t the clergy raved both in the pulpit and in print again&s;t this novel doctrine, as they &s;tiled it (and with what ju&s;tice may be &s;een above) this itinerant preacher, de&s;pi&s;ing all danger and fatigue, not only formed &s;ocie|ties in England of his followers, but traver&s;ing, time after time, immen&s;e tracks of land and water, pro&s;e|lyted multitudes in all parts of North America, and extended his cares even to the inhabitants of the infant colony of Georgia, where that wi&s;e and excellent go|vernor, Mr. Oglethorpe, well knowing that an attach|ment to religious principles, and a life of virtue and &s;elf denial, were &s;purs to indu&s;try and oeconomy, re|ceived him with open arms, and gave him all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Here he at length erected an <HI>Orphan|hou&s;e</HI> for poor and de&s;erted children; an in&s;titution that bid fair to be of extraordinary benefit in that country; the mo&s;t authentic account of which e&s;tabli&s;hment, by an impartial eye-witne&s;s, and publi&s;hed in ju&s;tice to the Methodi&s;ts, may be &s;een in the <HI>London Magazine</HI> for the year 1745, page 603. In the&s;e Chri&s;tian labours, perilous voyages, and painful journies through the wil|derne&s;s of America, he was followed by Me&s;&s;. John and Charles We&s;ley, his faithful and able co-adjutors,
<PB N="316" REF="323">who with a zeal and con&s;tancy &s;econd only to tho&s;e which actuated the primitive Apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples of our Saviour, thought no hard&s;hips in&s;urmountable, no dangers too terrifying in pro&s;ecuting the work they &s;up|po&s;ed them&s;elves appointed to
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of his own and his brother's conver&s;ion, &amp;c. and of the nece&s;|&s;ity of becoming field preachers, Mr. John We&s;ley gives the follow|ing account. "I was ordained deacon in 1725, and prie&s;t in the year following: but it was many years after this before I was con|vinced of the great truths above recited. During all that time, I was utterly ignorant of the nature and condition of ju&s;tification. Some|times I confounded it with &s;anctification (particularly when I was in Georgia). At other times I had &s;ome confu&s;ed notion about the for|givene&s;s of &s;ins: but then I took it for granted, the time of this mu&s;t be, either the hour of death, or the day of judgment. I was equally ignorant of the nature of &s;aving faith; apprehending it to mean no more, than a "firm a&s;&s;ent to all the propo&s;itions contain|ed in the Old and New Te&s;tament." As &s;oon as, by the great ble&s;|&s;ing of God, I had a clearer view of the&s;e things, I began to declare them to others al&s;o. I believed, and therefore I &s;pake. Where|ever I was now de&s;ired to preach, &s;alvation by faith was my only theme. My con&s;tant &s;ubjects were, "Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved. Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." The&s;e I explained and inforced with all my might, both in every church where I was a&s;ked to preach, and occa&s;ionally in the religious &s;ocieties of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; to &s;ome or other of which I was continually pre&s;&s;ed to go, by the &s;tewards or other members of them. Things were in this po&s;ture, when I was told, "I mu&s;t preach no more in this, and this, and another church." The rea|&s;on was u&s;ually added without re&s;erve, "Becau&s;e you preach &s;uch doctrine." So much the more tho&s;e who could not hear me there, flocked together when I was at any of the &s;ocieties; where I &s;poke more or le&s;s, though with much inconvenience, to as many as the room I was in would contain. But after a &s;hort time, finding tho&s;e rooms could not contain a tenth part of the people that were earne&s;t to hear, I determined to do the &s;ame thing in England which I had often done in a warmer climate; namely, when the hou&s;e would not contain the congregation, to preach in the open air. This I ac|cordingly did, fir&s;t at Bri&s;tol, where the &s;ociety-rooms were exceed|ingly &s;mall, and at King&s;wood, where we had no room at all; af|terwards in or near London. And I cannot &s;ay I have ever &s;een a more awful fight, than when, on Ro&s;e-Green, or the top of Han|nam-Mount, &s;ome thou&s;ands of people were calmly joined together in &s;olemn waiting upon God, while "they &s;tood, and under open sir adored the God who made both air, earth, heaven, and &s;ky." And whether they were li&s;tening to his word, with attention &s;till as night, or were lifting up their voice in prai&s;e, as the &s;ound of many waters, many a time have I been con&s;trained to &s;ay in my heart, "How dreadful is this place! This al&s;o is no other than the hou&s;e of God! This is the gate of heaven!" Be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, 1. That I was forbidden, as by a general con&s;ent, to preach in any church (though not by any judicial &s;entence) "for preaching &s;uch doctrine." This was the open, avowed cau&s;e: there was at that time no other, either real or pretended. 2. That I had no de&s;ire or de&s;ign to preach in the open air, till long after this prohibition. 3. That when I did, as it was no matter of choice, &s;o neither of premeditation. There was no &s;cheme at all previou&s;ly formed, which was to be &s;upported thereby; nor had I any other end in view than this, to &s;ave as many &s;ouls as I could. 4. Field-preaching was therefore a &s;udden expedient, a thing &s;ubmitted to, rather than cho&s;en; and therefore &s;ubmitted to, becau&s;e I thought preaching even thus better than not preaching at all; fir&s;t, in regard to my own &s;oul; becau&s;e a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel being committed to me, I did not dare not to preach the go&s;pel; 2dly, In regard to the &s;ouls of others, whom I every where &s;aw &s;eeking death in the error of their life."</P>
<P>The effects of their preaching are thus de&s;cribed by the &s;ame hand. "Ju&s;t at this time, when we wanted little of filling up the mea&s;ure of our iniquities, two or three clergymen of the church of England began vehemently to call &s;inners to repentance. In two or three years they had &s;ounded the alarm to the utmo&s;t borders of the land. Many thou&s;ands gathered together to hear them; and in every place where they came, many began to &s;hew &s;uch a concern for religion, as they never had done before. A &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion was made on their minds, of the importance of things eternal, and they had more earne&s;t de&s;ires of &s;erving God, than they had ever had from their earlie&s;t childhood. Thus did God begin to draw them toward him&s;elf, with the cords of love, with the bands of a man. Many of the&s;e were in a &s;hort time deeply convinced of the number and heinou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;ins. They were al&s;o made tho|roughly &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e tempers which are ju&s;tly hateful to God and man, and of their utter ignorance of God, and entire inability either to know, love, or &s;erve him. At the &s;ame time, they &s;aw in the &s;tronge&s;t light the in&s;ignificance of their out&s;ide religion; nay, and often confe&s;&s;ed it before God, as the mo&s;t abominable hypocri|&s;y. Thus did they &s;ink deeper and deeper into that repentance which mu&s;t ever precede faith in the Son of God. And from hence &s;prung fruits meet for repentance. The drunkard commenced &s;ober and temperate; the whoremonger ab&s;tained from adultery and for|nication; the unju&s;t from oppre&s;&s;ion and wrong. He that had been accu&s;tomed to cur&s;e and &s;wear for many years, now &s;wore no more. The &s;luggard began to work with his hands, that he might eat his own bread. The mi&s;er learned to deal his bread to the hungry, and to cover the naked with a garment. Indeed the whole form of their life was changed. They had left off doing evil, and learned to do well. But this was not all. Over and above this outward change, they began to experience inward religion. The love of God was &s;hed abroad in their hearts, which they continue to enjoy to this day. They love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us, and with-held not from us his Son, his only Son: and this love con&s;trains them to love all mankind, all the children of the Father of heaven and earth, and in&s;pires them with every holy and heavenly temper, the whole mind that was in Chri&s;t. Hence it is that they are now uniform in their behaviour, unblameable in all manner of conver&s;ation; and in what&s;oever &s;tate they are, they have learned therewith to be con|tent; in&s;omuch that now they can in every thing give thanks. They more than patiently acquie&s;ce, they rejoice and are exceeding glad, in all God's di&s;pen&s;ations towards them; for as long as they love God (and that love no man taketh from them), they are always happy in God. Thus they calmly travel on through life, being never weary nor faint in their minds, never repi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, murmuring, or di&s;&s;atisfied, ca&s;ting all their care upon God, till the hour comes that they &s;hould drop this covering of earth, and return unto the great Father of &s;pirits; then e&s;pecially it is that they rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. You who credit it not, come and &s;ee."</P></NOTE>. In London, parti|cularly,
<PB N="317" REF="324">a great change was &s;oon perceived in the ma|jority of the common people; an unu&s;ual &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="318" REF="325">appeared in their countenances, they refrained from prophane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and the alehou&s;es were deprived of their u&s;ual inebriated gue&s;ts. Meantime the more abandoned of the <HI>canaille,</HI> whom no precepts could reach, no future denunciations of puni&s;hment de|ter from wickedne&s;s, &s;pared not reproaches, and even frequently proceeded to open in&s;ults and abu&s;es of the preachers, who were as warmly defended by their par|ti&s;ans, &s;o as often to occa&s;ion tumults and riots, that were mutually charged by the Methodi&s;ts and their op|po&s;ers on each other, and kept the public for &s;ome years in perpetual di&s;pute and agitation. But, at length, now increa&s;ed to a prodigious number, they
<PB N="319" REF="326">began to form &s;ocieties apart, for wor&s;hip in their own way, and to appoint &s;tewards and other officers for the better regulation and government of tho&s;e &s;ocieties; the principal of which, in London, are the Tabernacle and Foundery near Moorfields, the Tabernacle in Tot|tenham Court road, with many others, in the city and &s;uburbs. Their founders have increa&s;ed their num|bers in Scotland and Ireland al&s;o, where they pur&s;ued their mi&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and in many places in England, where religion was &s;eldom heard of, they have produced order, humanity, civility, and a &s;erious regard to divine things, particularly among&s;t the colliers of King&s;wood, and the fells about New|ca&s;tle. If the reader de&s;ires to enter into particulars with regard to their hi&s;tory, he would do well to per|u&s;e the &s;everal <HI>Journals</HI> of Me&s;&s;. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>We&s;|ley,</HI> as I only propo&s;e here a general view of their ri&s;e, &amp;c. Indeed it is a peculiar circum&s;tance, that no &s;ect, in &s;o few years, ever became &s;o numerous, though they have met with mild treatment from the govern|ment, and have endured no per&s;ecution for their opi|nions, which has generally helped to increa&s;e, rather than to deter the followers of a new &s;y&s;tem of doc|trines. With regard to the common people, or the mob, which is ever of the national religion, &s;o far as drinking, &s;wearing, and rioting for it extends, the ap|pearance of the founders of Methodi&s;m, in the u&s;ual ve&s;tments of clergymen, captivated them, and prevent|ed many di&s;orders that would have ari&s;en, had per&s;ons not di&s;tingui&s;hed by that reverend garb endeavoured to exhort and in&s;truct them; and yet, according to Mr. We&s;ley's account
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Farther Appeal, part iii. p. 92, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>, he him&s;elf was, once particularly, in great danger of lo&s;ing his life; and the Methodi&s;ts &s;uffered by the &s;poils and ravages of de&s;perate and wic|ked mobs, in Stafford&s;hire, in the year 1743, to the amount of 504l. 17s. at the lowe&s;t computation, owing
<PB N="320" REF="327">to a &s;hameful connivance, perhaps under-hand encou|ragement, of tho&s;e who &s;hould have re&s;trained or pu|ni&s;hed them for their diabolical exce&s;&s;es. In fact, too many of their oppo&s;ers merit the character Mr. We&s;ley has given them. "
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Farther Appeal, part iii. p. 136.</NOTE> I have heard &s;ome affirm (&s;ays he) that the mo&s;t bitter enemies to the pre&s;ent work of God were Phari&s;ees. They meant men who had the form of godline&s;s, but denied the power of it. But I cannot &s;ay &s;o. The &s;harpe&s;t adver&s;aries thereof (unle&s;s we might except a few honourable men, whom I may be excu&s;ed from naming) were the <HI>&s;cum</HI> of Corn|wall, the <HI>rabble</HI> of Bil&s;ton and Darle&s;ton, the <HI>wild bea&s;ts</HI> of Wal&s;al, and the <HI>turnkeys</HI> of Newgate."</P>
<P>In fine, the very enemies of the&s;e people will &s;carce deny that they have greatly contributed to reform and e&s;tabli&s;h order and civility among&s;t the common peo|ple; that they are (I mean the real Methodi&s;ts; for Pre&s;byterians, Quakers, and every other &s;ect, have been per&s;onated as well as they, for intere&s;ted or vil|lainous purpo&s;es) are a peaceable, upright, and prai&s;e|worthy &s;et of people; that they cannot upon their prin|ciples di&s;tre&s;s; but mu&s;t add &s;trength to the hands of government, and that their ri&s;e and amazing progre&s;s has rou&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy from that lethargy into which they had fallen, and invigorated them to be more attendant on the charge to which they were &s;o &s;o|lemnly appointed. Their favourite doctrines have found their way al&s;o into the pulpits of our churches, and many excellent preachers, who do not leave the church on that account, inforce them at this day from their pulpits. The great &s;pread of Methodi&s;m has cer|tainly contributed to &s;et people in general upon think|ing of matters of the greate&s;t moment to them; and I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, from my own ob&s;ervation, that there has been &s;uch an appearance of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;uch a concern for religion, vi&s;ible in all ranks of peo|ple,
<PB N="321" REF="328">&s;ince it has &s;o much prevailed, as cannot be re|membered in any &s;uch period of time &s;ince the re|&s;toration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this head with a brief account of their manner of wor&s;hip, church-di&s;cipline, &amp;c.</P>
<P>With regard to their manner of wor&s;hip, it is like that of the church of England, &s;ave that they allow them&s;elves to continue long in extempore prayer, and that they &s;ing &s;uch hymns as are approved by the &s;o|ciety. Indeed they allow of lay-preachers, or &s;uffer un|learned men to preach or exhort, in their places of wor|&s;hip. "I am bold to affirm (&s;ays Mr. We&s;ley) that the&s;e unlettered men have help from God for that great work, the &s;aving &s;ouls from death; &s;eeing he hath enabled, and doth enable them &s;till, to turn many to righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Thus hath he de&s;troyed the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and brought to nought the under&s;tanding of the pru|dent. When they imagined they had effectually &s;hut the door, and blocked up every pa&s;&s;age, whereby any help could come to two or three preachers, weak in body as well as &s;oul; who they might rea&s;onably believe would, humanly &s;peaking, wear them&s;elves out in a &s;hort time: when they had gained their point, by &s;ecu|ring (as they &s;uppo&s;ed) all the men of learning in the nation, He that &s;itteth in heaven laughed them to &s;corn, and came upon them by a way they thought not of. Out of the &s;tones he rai&s;ed up tho&s;e who &s;hould beget children to Abraham. We had no more fore&s;ight of this than you. Nay, we had the deepe&s;t prejudices again&s;t it, until we could not but own, that God gave wi&s;dom from above to the&s;e unlearned and ignorant men; &s;o that the work of the Lord pro&s;pered in their hand, and &s;inners were daily converted to God.</P>
<P>Indeed in the one thing which they profe&s;s to know, they are not ignorant men. I tru&s;t there is not one of them who is not able to go thro' &s;uch an examination, in &s;ub&s;tantial, practical, experimental divinity, as few of our candidates for holy orders, even in the univer|&s;ity
<PB N="322" REF="329">(I &s;peak it with &s;orrow and &s;hame, and in tender love) are able to do."</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome differences among&s;t the lead|ers of this people, particularly between Mr. Whitefield and Mr. We&s;ley, relative to the doctrine of reproba|tion; but they agree in fundamentals: in &s;maller points, each thinks and lets think, and Mr. We&s;ley &s;ays he reverences Mr. Whitefield, both as a child of God, and a true mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I could wi&s;h all religious di&s;putes had been managed with e|qual candour.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;cipline of the Methodi&s;ts, I cannot give a better account of it, than is contained in a &s;mall tract, intitled, <HI>The Nature, De&s;ign, and general Rules, of the united Societies in London, Bri&s;tol, King&s;wood, and Newca&s;tle upon Tyne,</HI> 7th edit. 1762, which I &s;hall therefore lay before my readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<P N="1">"1. In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten per&s;ons came to me in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of &s;in, and earne&s;tly groaning for redemption. They de&s;ired (as did two or three more the next day) that I would &s;pend &s;ome time with them in prayer, and advi&s;e them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they &s;aw continually hanging over their heads. That we might have more time for this great work, I appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, namely, on Thur&s;day, in the evening. To the&s;e, and as many more as de&s;ired to join with them (for their number increa&s;ed daily) I gave tho&s;e advices from time to time which I judged mo&s;t need|ful for them; and we always concluded our meeting with prayer &s;uited to their &s;everal nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P N="2">2. This was the ri&s;e of the UNITED SOCIETY, fir&s;t in London, and then in other places. Such a &s;ociety is no other than "a company of men having the form and &s;eeking the power of godline&s;s, united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and
<PB N="323" REF="330">to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their &s;alvation."</P>
<P N="3">3. That it may the more ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned, whe|ther they are indeed working out their &s;alvation, each &s;ociety is divided into &s;maller companies, called <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> according to their re&s;pective places of abode. There are about twelve per&s;ons in every cla&s;s, one of whom is &s;tiled <HI>the leader.</HI> It is his bu&s;ine&s;s, 1. To &s;ee each per&s;on in his cla&s;s, once a-week at the lea&s;t, in order to inquire how their &s;ouls pro&s;per; to advi&s;e, reprove, comfort, or exhort, as occa&s;ion may require; to re|ceive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the poor. 2. To meet the mini&s;ter and the &s;tewards of the &s;ociety once a-week, in order to inform the mi|ni&s;ter of any that are &s;ick, or of any that walk di&s;or|derly, and will not be reproved; to pay to the &s;tewards what they have received of their &s;everal cla&s;&s;es in the week preceding, and to &s;hew their account of what each per&s;on has contributed.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is one only condition previou&s;ly required in tho&s;e who de&s;ire admittance into the&s;e &s;ocieties, "a de&s;ire to flee from the wrath to come, to be &s;aved from their &s;ins." But wherever this is really fixed in the &s;oul, it will be &s;hewn by its fruits. It is therefore ex|pected of all who continue therein, that they &s;hould continue to evidence their de&s;ire of &s;alvation.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Methodi&s;ts have in &s;ome places, as in Totten|ham-Court road, built alms-hou&s;es for their more de&s;titute poor; they have al&s;o, at times, rai&s;ed con&s;i|derable &s;ums for the relief of foreign Prote&s;tants, and their works of love during the late war will ever be remembered to their honour. I need not remind my reader, that Mr. Whitefield has lately received the thanks of the legi&s;lature at Bo&s;ton in New England, for the bountiful collection made by him towards the relief of the &s;ufferers by the late fire in that city.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude my hi&s;tory of the Methodi&s;ts with another quotation from Mr. We&s;ley, in an&s;wer to the current report of his receiving great emoluments from his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as director of the Metho|di&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="335">"But perhaps you have heard, that "we in truth regard no church at all; that gain is the true &s;pring of all our actions; that I, in particular, am well paid for my work, having thirteen hundred pounds a year (as a Reverend author accurately computes it) at the Foundery alone, over and above what I receive from Bri&s;tol, King&s;wood, Newca&s;tle, and other places; and that whoever &s;urvives me will &s;ee I have made a good u&s;e of my time, for I &s;hall not die a beggar."</P>
<P>I freely own this is one of the be&s;t devi&s;ed objections which has ever yet been made; becau&s;e it not only puts us upon proving a negative (which is &s;eldom an ea&s;y ta&s;k) but al&s;o one of &s;uch a kind as &s;carce admits of any demon&s;trative proof at all. But for &s;uch proof as the nature of the thing allows, I appeal to my man|ner of life which hath been from the beginning. Ye who have &s;een it (and not with a friendly eye) for the&s;e twelve or fourteen years la&s;t pa&s;t, or for any part of that time, have ye ever &s;een any thing like the love of gain therein? Did I not continually remember the words of the Lord Je&s;us, "It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive?" Ye of Oxford, do ye not know the&s;e things are &s;o? What gain did I &s;eek among you? Of whom did I take any thing? From whom did I co|vet &s;ilver, or gold, or apparel? To whom did I deny any thing which I had, even to the hour that I depart|ed from you? Ye of Epworth and Wroote, among whom I mini&s;tered for (nearly) the &s;pace of three years, what gain did I &s;eek among you? or of whom did I take or cover any thing? Ye of Savannah and Fre|derica, among whom God afterwards proved me, and &s;hewed me what was in my heart, what gain did I &s;eek among you? Of whom did I take any thing? or who&s;e food or apparel did I covet (for &s;ilver or gold had ye none, no more than I my&s;elf for many months) even when I was in hunger and nakedne&s;s? Ye your|&s;elves, and the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, know that I lie not.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="336">"But (it is &s;aid) things are fairly altered now. Now I cannot complain of wanting any thing; having the yearly income of a Bi&s;hop of London, over and above what I gain at other places." At what other places, my friend? inform your&s;elf a little better, and you will find, that both at Newca&s;tle, Bri&s;tol, and King&s;|wood (the only places, be&s;ide London, where any col|lection at all is made) the money collected is both re|ceived and expended by the &s;tewards of tho&s;e &s;everal &s;ocieties, and never comes into my hands at all, neither fir&s;t nor la&s;t. And you, or any who de&s;ire it, &s;hall read over the accounts kept by any of the&s;e &s;tewards, and &s;ee with your own eyes, that by all the&s;e &s;ocieties I gain ju&s;t as much as you do.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e in London &s;tands thus. In November 1739, two Gentlemen, then unknown to me (Mr. Ball and Mr. Watkins) came and de&s;ired me once and again, to preach in a place called the Foundery near Moorfields. With much reluctance I at length complied. I was &s;oon after pre&s;&s;ed to take that place into my own hands. Tho&s;e who were mo&s;t earne&s;t therein, lent me the pur|cha&s;e-money, which was 115l. Mr. Watkins and Mr. Ball then delivered me the names of &s;everal &s;ub&s;cri|bers, who offered to pay, &s;ome four, or &s;ix, &s;ome ten &s;hillings a year towards the re-payment of the purcha&s;e|money, and the putting the buildings into repair. This amounted one year to near 200l. the &s;econd to a|bout 140, and &s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The united &s;ociety begun a little after, who&s;e weekly contribution (chiefly for the poor) is received and expended by the &s;tewards, and comes not into my hands at all. But there is al&s;o a quarterly &s;ub&s;cription of many of the &s;ociety, which is nearly equal to that above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The u&s;es to which the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions have been hitherto applied, are, 1&s;t, The payment of that 115l. 2dly, The repairing (I might almo&s;t &s;ay rebuilding)
<PB N="328" REF="337">that va&s;t, uncouth heap of ruins at the Foundery; 3dly, The building galleries both for men and women; 4thly, The enlarging the &s;ociety-room to near thrice its fir&s;t bigne&s;s. All taxes and occa&s;ional expences are likewi&s;e defrayed out of this fund. And it has been hitherto &s;o far from yielding any overplus, that it has never &s;ufficed for the&s;e purpo&s;es yet. So far from it, that I am &s;till in debt, on the&s;e accounts, near 300l. &s;o much have I hitherto gained by preaching the go&s;|pel! be&s;ides a debt of 150l. &s;till remaining on account of the &s;chools built at Bri&s;tol; and another of above 200l. on account of that now building at Newca&s;tle. I de&s;ire any rea&s;onable man would now &s;it down and lay the&s;e things together, and let him &s;ee, whether, al|lowing me a grain of common &s;en&s;e (if not of com|mon hone&s;ty) he can po&s;&s;ibly conceive, that a view of gain would induce me to act in this manner.</P>
<P>You can never reconcile it with any degree of com|mon &s;en&s;e, that a man who wants nothing, who has already all the nece&s;&s;aries, all the conveniencies, nay, and many of the &s;uperfluities of life, and the&s;e not only independent on any one, but le&s;s liable to contingen|cies than even a gentleman's freehold e&s;tate, that &s;uch an one &s;hould calmly and deliberately throw up his ca&s;e, mo&s;t of his friends, his reputation, and that way of life which of all others is mo&s;t agreeable both to his natural temper and education: that he &s;hould toil day and night, &s;pend all his time and &s;trength, know|ingly de&s;troy a firm con&s;titution, and ha&s;ten into weak|ne&s;s, pain, di&s;ea&s;es, death&mdash;to gain a debt of &s;ix or &s;even hundred pounds!</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the balance on the other &s;ide, let me a&s;k you one plain que&s;tion, "For what gain (&s;etting con&s;cience a&s;ide) will you be obliged to act thus? to live exactly as I do? For what price will you preach (and that with all your might, not in an ea&s;y indolent, fa&s;hionable way) eighteen or nineteen times every
<PB N="329" REF="338">week? and this throughout the year? What &s;hall I give you, to travel &s;even or eight hundred miles, in all weathers, every two or three months? For what &s;alary will you ab&s;tain from all other diver&s;ions, than the doing good, and the prai&s;ing God?" I am mi&s;taken, if you would not prefer &s;trangling to &s;uch a life, even with thou&s;ands of gold and &s;ilver."</P>

At pre&s;ent, by what I can learn, they are but a few, meeting at two or three places of wor&s;hip in London. They took their origin from John Agricola, who lived about the year 1335, and who taught "That the law is no way nece&s;&s;ary under the go&s;pel: that good works do not promote our &s;alvation, nor ill ones hinder it: that repentance is not to be preached from the deca|logue, but only from the go&s;pel

De|cember 4, 1647, being at his hou&s;e at Ilford, in E&s;&s;ex, he told his wife that he had been in a trance, and received a me&s;&s;age from God, which he mu&s;t immediately deliver to the army.

<P>They believe that the whole work of man's &s;alva|tion was accompli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on the cro&s;s. &mdash;That Chri&s;t's blood and our &s;ins went away toge|ther:&mdash;That then all our &s;ins were taken away by Chri&s;t, and blotted out for ever:&mdash;That nothing el&s;e be&s;ide faith is required in order to ju&s;tification and &s;alvation: &mdash;That there is but one duty, which is that of be|lieving; one mu&s;t do nothing, but quietly attend the voice of the Lord. The gates of heaven are &s;hut upon workers and open to believers. If we do nothing for heaven, we do as much as God requires. To believe certainly that Chri&s;t &s;uffered death for us, is enough; we want no more. We are ju&s;tified by our &s;ubmitting <HI>in our judgments</HI> to the truth of God's grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that a man do any works that he may be ju&s;tified and &s;aved. God doth not re|quire thee to do any thing that thou maye&s;t be &s;aved or ju&s;tified. The law &s;ets thee to work; but the go&s;pel binds thee to do nothing at all. Nay, the works are not only not required, but forbidden. God forbids us to work for ju&s;tification: and when the Apo&s;tle Paul pre&s;&s;eth men to believe, it is as much as if he had bid them not to work.&mdash;That the moral law is nothing to man. From any demand of the law, no man is obliged to go one &s;tep, to give away one farthing, to eat, or omit one mor&s;el. For what did our Lord do with the law? He aboli&s;hed it

<PB N="332" REF="341">ii. 20.&mdash;That outward things do nothing avail to &s;al|vation. If love to God, and love to our neighbour, and relieving the poor, be altogether unprofitable and unavoidable, either to ju&s;tification or &s;alvation; then the&s;e outward works, in &s;ubmitting to outward ordinances (viz. the ordinances of Chri&s;t) are much le&s;s available. &mdash;Tho&s;e per&s;ons bring in the mo&s;t dangerous kind of Popery, and pervert the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who per&s;uade men, that if they do not &s;ubmit to the ordinances of the Lord Je&s;us, he will not confe&s;s them before his Fa|ther. It is better not to practi&s;e outward ordinances at all, than to practi&s;e them on the&s;e go&s;pel-de&s;troying principles, to the ruining of our &s;ouls.&mdash;A believer has no inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s: God will &s;ave us to the ut|mo&s;t without any righteou&s;ne&s;s or holine&s;s of our own. To look for inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s is to deny the &s;pirit, and trample under foot the blood of the covenant. But believers have not any inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s in them. Our righteou&s;ne&s;s is nothing but the imputation of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. A believer has no holi|ne&s;s in him&s;elf, but in Chri&s;t only. The trials of the &s;pirit (commonly called &s;anctification) &s;uch as love, gentlene&s;s, long-&s;uffering, goodne&s;s, meekne&s;s, tem|perance, neither make us holy before God, nor in our own con&s;ciences, <HI>i. e.</HI> we are not made good or holy by any inward qualities or di&s;po&s;itions; but being made pure and holy in our con&s;ciences, by believing in Chri&s;t, we bear forth inwardly and outwardly the fruits of holine&s;s. A believer does not increa&s;e in holine&s;s as he increa&s;es in the love of God and man. The very moment he is ju&s;tified, he is wholly &s;anctified, and he is neither more nor le&s;s holy from that hour to the day of his death. Entire ju&s;tification, and entire &s;anctifica|tion, are in the &s;ame in&s;tant, and neither of them is, thenceforth, capable of increa&s;e or decrea&s;e. We are to grow in grace, but not in holine&s;s. The moment we are ju&s;tified, we are as pure in heart as ever we &s;hall
<PB N="333" REF="342">be. A new born babe is as pure in heart as a father in Chri&s;t; there is no difference.</P>
<P>In addition to this collective detail of the principles of the Antinomians, I &s;hall give my readers the &s;ub|&s;tance of a letter received from one of them, which, perhaps, is a more perfect view of the principles of the &s;ect, and of many popular preachers, who yet do not &s;eparate from the church, or the &s;ects with which they are united, on that account.</P>
<Q>This I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that no &s;ooner does a per&s;on believe and profe&s;s &s;alvation alone by Chri&s;t, without works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as done by him, but immediately upon his embracing &s;uch a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, he &s;hall be branded with the name of an Anti|nomian, though he &s;hould be at the &s;ame time, not|with&s;tanding his change of profe&s;&s;ion, as to his beha|viour and deportment in life, as unblameable as the &s;tricte&s;t legali&s;t whatever; from whence it is pret|ty evident, that the name of an Antinomian is given to many by way of reproach or ridicule, and that there are many &s;o accounted, to whom the charge does not ju&s;tly belong; becau&s;e they di&s;own all their own works in point of merit or acceptance with God: yet that is no proof, but what they may be found in the practice of all &s;uch good works as are nece&s;&s;ary for good govern|ment and oeconomy in &s;ociety. They own the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e, but that they do not make up or con&s;titute any part of that kingdom which is &s;piritual, and is not of this world. As I am far from thinking that the religion of Je&s;us con&s;i&s;ts merely in externals, neither do I think that an intricate &s;y&s;tem of doctrines (&s;uch as are &s;uperior to a common under&s;tanding) is in the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, but rather pre|judicial to tho&s;e who would be edified by what they profe&s;s. There &s;eems to me to be two very e&s;&s;ential points ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, namely, the knowledge of our&s;elves, of the true &s;tate of human nature, and the knowledge of &s;alvation; in and through the promi&s;ed
<PB N="334" REF="343">Me&s;&s;iah or Redeemer; or, in other words, that Je&s;us is the Son of God, that he died for our &s;ins and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, agreeable to the &s;cripture te&s;timony; that man is a &s;inner, rea&s;on and revelation afford us the mo&s;t ample proof: from whence it is likewi&s;e evident, that he &s;tands convicted in his be&s;t doings and performances by the law of his Maker, which &s;piritual and divine commandment entails con|demnation on all who hope for mercy and acceptance by a partial and imperfect obedience. As oppo&s;ites tend to illu&s;trate, &s;o does an acquaintance with our|&s;elves, with the frailty and infirmity of our nature, &s;erve to illu&s;trate the beauty and extent of divine grace, as manife&s;t in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t our Saviour. To &s;peak with candour and impartiality for my&s;elf, with|out reference to any per&s;on or party whatever. As a Chri&s;tian, I acknowledge Chri&s;t as the only foundation of my hope towards God, my acceptance with him, and rejoicing in him: I re&s;t all my concerns for time and eternity with him, as my wi&s;dom to guide me thro' all the mazes of life: I &s;ee mercy con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, and a plenitude of grace extending to the guilty, and all in harmony with every attribute of Deity, in and through the one mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us: the harmony and con&s;i&s;tency of the &s;acred pages I likewi&s;e &s;ee in him, of whom Mo&s;es and the prophets &s;pake, every precept fulfilled by him, every threatening endured by him, and every promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing I lay claim unto, as my lawful inheritance, in and through him, my glorious and exalted head. In con&s;equence of this relation between Chri&s;t, as the head, and the church, his members, un&s;peakable great and exten&s;ive are the privileges which they have a claim unto, and yet with reverence they acknow|ledge the pre-eminence of their head in all things. The name of Je&s;us, a Saviour, is to me a &s;ound more &s;triking, more excellent, more harmonious, than the mo&s;t me|lodious notes from the be&s;t tuned in&s;trument. The
<PB N="335" REF="344">whole creation, in its va&s;t extent and variety, is to me as &s;o many &s;triking figures of that con&s;ummate beauty and perfection, which dwells in his adorable per&s;on; every amiable character by which he &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, is to me full fraught with in&s;truction, admiration, and con&s;olation: he is precious and honourable in my e&s;teem, and the language of the Apo&s;tle is with me very familiar; <HI>i. e.</HI> "I count all things but lo&s;s for the ex|cellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord, &amp;c." While I hear of various &s;ounds from the various &s;ecta|ries, as having learned to di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of the true &s;hepherd, I know that never varies. I &s;ee no danger of running into error, while I have recour&s;e to, and gather all my &s;upplies from him, as the fountain of truth it&s;elf. Thus I go on in dependance upon and intercour&s;e with my Lord and Saviour, as, having a glimp&s;e of his glory, I &s;ometimes contemplate the plea|&s;ures that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from a happy and im|mortal exi&s;tence. Till that period &s;hall commence, my prevailing prayer and &s;upplication is, that he would teach me in all things by his influence and Spirit, that, under a &s;en&s;e of my own in&s;ufficiency, I may rely up|on his fulne&s;s; that, with a becoming gratitude of &s;oul, I may acknowledge every in&s;tance of his good|ne&s;s in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence and grace; that I may have a continued &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence, which contains the fulne&s;s of joy; the views of his re|conciled countenance, which makes life plea&s;ant, and gives a true reli&s;h for every rational enjoyment, in forming a ju&s;t e&s;timation of per&s;ons and things; im|ploring in all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, &s;o as to be able to ju&s;tify him in the whole of his dealings towards the children of men. But perhaps you will &s;ay, what is all this, without the external or practical part? I an&s;wer, As the le&s;&s;er mu&s;t of con&s;equence be &s;ub&s;er|vient to the greater; &s;o, where the religion of Je&s;us has its proper influence on the mind, every thing that

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes; becau&s;e Chri&s;t being his holine&s;s, he lived for him, believed for him, and was obedient for him; therefore God wanted nothing of fallen man.</P>

All that can be done is to take it, as well as the account of their principles, &amp;c. from tho&s;e who have wrote profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t them, and who having been initiated into their my&s;teries, afterwards for&s;ook their &s;ociety; in which I am al&s;o ju&s;tified, by the Mo|ravians having never returned any proper an&s;wer to the&s;e writers, &s;o that their veracity remains at pre&s;ent un|impeached. I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed to have received the proper intelligence from them&s;elves and their writings; but after much patience exerci&s;ed upon the occa&s;ion, found my&s;elf di&s;appointed.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Candid Narrative, p. 6 &amp; &s;eq. printed in 1753, where are re|ferences to the authorities made u&s;e of, which I omit in this brief account.</NOTE> "Nicholas Lewis, Count of Zinzendorf, is the author of Herrnhuti&s;m, and it is to him that the progre&s;s this &s;ect has hitherto made, is to be a&s;cribed. According to the account he gives of him&s;elf, he formed from the tenth year of his age a de&s;ign to gather together a little &s;ociety of believers, among&s;t whom he might live, and who &s;hould entirely employ them&s;elves in exer|ci&s;es of devotion, under his direction. When he became of age, which was in the year 1721, his thoughts were wholly bent on executing his project, and being joined by &s;ome per&s;ons, that were of his way of thinking, he &s;ettled at Berthol&s;dorf in Upper Lu&s;atia, an e&s;tate which he had purcha&s;ed, giving the curacy of that
<PB N="339" REF="348">village, then vacant, to a &s;tudent, in whom he had perceived &s;entiments analogous to his own.</P>
<P>Berthol&s;dorf &s;oon came to be known for this &s;ort of piety. News thereof was brought to Moravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by a carpenter, named Chri&s;tian David, who, according to Le Long, had been before in that country, and there in&s;tilled into the minds of &s;everal people a di&s;ta&s;te to the &s;uper&s;tition of the Romi&s;h church, and an inclination to the Prote&s;tant religion. Having engaged two or three of the&s;e pro&s;elytes to leave that country with their families, Count Zinzendorf received them with gladne&s;s at Berthol&s;dorf. They were directed to build an hou&s;e in a wood, about half a league from that village, which &s;oon was fini&s;hed, &s;o that on St. Martin's day, 1722, the&s;e people held their fir&s;t meeting there. It is &s;aid, that they fore&s;aw that God would kindle a light in this place that &s;hould enlighten all the country. Chri&s;tian David was &s;o &s;ure of the future growth of this &s;ettlement, that he already divided the &s;pot of ground round it into quarters, and marked out in what direc|tions the &s;treets were to run. The event has not con|tradicted this progno&s;tication. A good many people from Moravia and el&s;ewhere, to &s;helter them&s;elves un|der the protection of Count Zinzendorf, flocked to this new &s;ettlement, and built hou&s;es; and the Count him|&s;elf fixed his re&s;idence there. In a few years it became a con&s;iderable village, having an orphan-hou&s;e and o|ther public buildings. Thirty-four hou&s;es were already built there in 1728; and in 1732 the number of in|habitants amounted to &s;ix hundred. An adjacent hill called the Huth-Berg, gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e coloni&s;ts to call their dwelling-place Huth des Herrn, and af|terwards Herrnhuth; which may be interpreted <HI>the guard or protection of the Lord;</HI> and from this the whole &s;ect has taken its name.</P>
<P>The Herrnhuters &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed among them&s;elves a &s;ort of di&s;cipline, which clo&s;ely unites them to one another, divides them into different cla&s;&s;es, puts them
<PB N="340" REF="349">under an entire dependance on their &s;uperiors, and con|fines them to certain exerci&s;es of devotion, and to the ob&s;erving of different little rules. One may call it a mona&s;tic in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The difference of age, &s;ex, and the &s;ituation their members are in with re&s;pect to matrimony, con&s;titute the&s;e different cla&s;&s;es. There are cla&s;&s;es of married men, married women, widowers, widows, maids, ba|chelors, children. Each has its director, cho&s;en by its members. The &s;ame employments the men have a|mong them&s;elves, are among the women, which are exerci&s;ed by per&s;ons of their own &s;ex. Every member is daily vi&s;ited by one of his cla&s;s, who gives him ex|hortations, and takes notice of the actual &s;tate of his &s;oul, whereof he makes a report to the elders. Fre|quent particular a&s;&s;emblies are held in each cla&s;s, and general ones by the whole &s;ociety. The over&s;eers or leaders have al&s;o their private meetings to in&s;truct one another in matters concerning the guidance of &s;ouls. The members of each cla&s;s are &s;ubdivided into people that are dead, awaked, ignorant, willing di&s;ciples, di&s;ciples that have made a progre&s;s. Proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance is given to each of the&s;e &s;ubdivi&s;ions; but above all, great care is taken of tho&s;e that are &s;piritually dead.</P>
<P>They pay an uncommon attention to the in&s;truction of youth. Be&s;ides tho&s;e that have the care of or|phans, there are others that are intru&s;ted with that of all the other children. Count Zinzendorf's zeal has &s;ometimes carried him &s;o far, as to take children to his own home to in&s;truct them, to the number of twenty, whereof nine or ten &s;lept in his bed-chamber. There are a&s;&s;emblies held of little children that are not yet in a condition to walk. They are carried thither. Hymns are &s;ung in the&s;e meetings, and prayers made; even &s;ermons are preached to them &s;uitable to the capa|city of the&s;e infant-hearers.</P>
<P>The elder, co-elder, the vice-elder, &s;uperintend all the cla&s;&s;es. There are likewi&s;e informers by office, &s;ome of them known, &s;ome kept &s;ecret, be&s;ides a great
<PB N="341" REF="350">many other employments and titles, the detail of which would be too long and too tedious here.</P>
<P>A great part of their wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts in &s;inging. They pretend that children in particular are in&s;tructed in their religion by hymns. Count Zinzendorf relates a very extraordinary thing in his <HI>Natural Reflexions,</HI> viz. "that the chanters of the &s;ociety mu&s;t have re|ceived a particular and almo&s;t inimitable gift of God: for when they are obliged to &s;ing at the head of the congregation, their &s;ongs are always a connected re|petition of tho&s;e matters that had been preached ju&s;t be|fore."</P>
<P>At all hours, whether day or night, &s;ome per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, are appointed by rotation to pray for the &s;ociety. And what is mo&s;t remarkable, the&s;e people, without call, clock or watch, are acquainted, by an in|ward feeling, when their hour comes in which they are to perform their duty.</P>
<P>When the brethren perceive that the zeal of the &s;o|ciety is declining, their devotion is revived, by cele|brating <HI>Agapes</HI> or love-fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The ca&s;ting of lots is much practi&s;ed among them. They make u&s;e of it to learn the will of the Lord.</P>
<P>The elders have the &s;ole right of making matches. No promi&s;e of marriage is of any validity without their con&s;ent. The maids devote them&s;elves to the Saviour, not that their intent is never to marry, but to marry only &s;uch a per&s;on, with re&s;pect to whom God &s;hall have made known to them with certainty, that he is regenerated, in&s;tructed in the importance of the con|jugal &s;tate, and appointed by the divine director to en|ter into that &s;tate.</P>
<P>All is extraordinary at Herrnhut. The mo&s;t &s;tub|born di&s;ea&s;es vani&s;h there without help: very rarely one dies there of a violent fever. But it is common to die there of a cold, defluxion, or &s;uch like other &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition. The&s;e are at lea&s;t things Count Zinzen|dorf affirms in a writing, dated January 24, 1732,
<PB N="342" REF="351">and pre&s;ented to the mini&s;try of the court of Dre&s;|den.</P>
<P>I do not find that the Herrnhuters to the year 1729, pretended to be any thing more than members of the Lutheran church at Berthol&s;dorf. Indeed, they were all of them either born among Lutherans, or converted from Popery to the faith of the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion; and if &s;ome among&s;t them entertained ideas of Calvin|i&s;m, Count Zinzendorf took care to cure them of it. But from this time the Herrnhuters, undoubtedly with a view to &s;et their &s;ociety off to better advantage, would pa&s;s for a &s;prig of tho&s;e Bohemian and Moravian brethren, who, a long time before Luther, lived &s;e|parated from the Romi&s;h church, and who in the time of the reformation entered into brotherly corre|&s;pondence with the two great Prote&s;tant &s;ocieties, but without uniting with either of them. And Count Zinzendorf has &s;ince that time ever talked in this &s;train. He pretends that the&s;e brethren originally were of the Greek church, and in proce&s;s of time had united with the Walden&s;es, who derived their original from the Latin Church. He be&s;tows the greate&s;t encomiums on this Moravian church, &s;o much renowned in for|mer times, eclip&s;ed and forgot afterwards, and at length, if credit may be given him, revived under his au&s;pices at Herrnhut. He gives her the mo&s;t pompous titles; as, the <HI>church of the Cro&s;s,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>church of the Lamb,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>church of the Blood and Wounds,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Theo|cracy,</HI> &mdash;a <HI>people whereunto never was &s;een the like,</HI>&mdash; they are <HI>the hundred forty four thou&s;and &s;ervants of God marked on their foreheads</HI>&mdash;whereof St. John makes mention in his <HI>Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>This de&s;cent would, without doubt, do honour to Herrnhuti&s;m, but there is a nece&s;&s;ity of proving it fir&s;t. Let us examine whether it ever has yet been proved? So far from it, that even &s;etting a&s;ide the doctrine of the Herrnhuters, which openly contradicts this vain|glorious preten&s;ion, it has been acknowledged and proved by one of their own Bi&s;hops, that the ancient
<PB N="343" REF="352">Moravian brethren mixed with the reformed in Poland, and that not one of tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed their doctrine remained in Bohemia and Moravia, where it has been entirely extirpated ever &s;ince the year 1620. The Mo|ravians, who retired to Herrnhut, and who are the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable part of the inhabitants of that vil|lage, have nothing common with the ancient Bohemi|an and Moravian brethren. They are Roman Catho|licks converted to the Prote&s;tant religion, as the Herrn|huters them&s;elves acknowledge.</P>
<P>As the Herrnhut &s;ociety was begun upon the e&s;tate of Count Zinzendorf, under his protection, by his care and benefactions, and according to his ideas and views; it was but natural he &s;hould have a very great authority over it. And &s;o it happens; he has always been the &s;oul, the oracle, and the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of it. He tells us him&s;elf that he has always been at the head of his &s;ect, both in temporals and &s;pirituals, and his di&s;ciples &s;ay the &s;ame. Though titles could add no|thing to his authority, yet he has not di&s;dained them. He has even made alterations in them at different times. From the year 1726, he was called the <HI>tru&s;tee</HI> or <HI>guardian</HI> of the brethren, which happened in a &s;ingular manner, as he tells us him&s;elf. Chri&s;tian David, the carpenter, of whom mention has been made, being once in the Count's apartment to talk with him, all on a &s;udden gave him this title; which afterwards was confirmed by the unanimous con&s;ent of the &s;ociety. In the month of March 1730, he re&s;igned this dignity. In September 1732, the &s;ociety pre&s;&s;ed him to take it upon him, delivering to him an appointment or call for that purpo&s;e, in form of an act, &s;igned by the bre|thren and &s;i&s;ters that were of the privy council of the &s;ociety. At that time he refu&s;ed to comply, but grant|ed their reque&s;t &s;ome months after, upon a new appoint|ment, dated January 26, 1733. In 1737 Count Zinzendorf, who, from the age of &s;eventeen, had believed he had a call from Providence to an eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
<PB N="344" REF="353">&s;tate or condition of life, and who had already publickly preached in &s;ome of the Lutheran churches, got him&s;elf con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of his &s;ect. From that time, according to the cu&s;tom of Bi&s;hops, he made u&s;e of his Chri&s;tian name, and of that of his &s;ee, viz. Ludovicus Moravien&s;is. The Prelate of this new|fa&s;hioned creation, neverthele&s;s did not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be dazzled by the lu&s;tre of his mitre. He tells us him|&s;elf, that he had very little forwardne&s;s to make a fi|gure as a Bi&s;hop; and in the third general &s;ynod of Herrnhuti&s;m, held at Gotha in 1740, he laid down his epi&s;copal dignity; which however had made no change with re&s;pect to his office of tru&s;tee or guardian of the brethren. It appears at lea&s;t, that he was &s;till ve&s;ted with it in 1743, becau&s;e at that time the brethren di&s;|charged him from it. But this was only done with a view to give him a much more honourable title, viz. that of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary and oeconomi&s;t, with power to nominate a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and an expre&s;s clau&s;e, that nothing of importance &s;hould be done or conclud|ed without his con&s;ent. He did not accept this new promotion till towards the clo&s;e of the following year. Lately we &s;ee him &s;tile him&s;elf <HI>Lord Advocate of the Unitas Fratrum.</HI></P>
<P>Count Zinzendorf has very early been about extend|ing his &s;ect. He has &s;ent his fellow-labourers through|out the world. He him&s;elf has been over all Europe, and at lea&s;t twice in America. From the year 1733, a new Herrnhut has been &s;et up in Groenland; and before the end of the preceding year the mi&s;&s;ionaries of Herrnhuti&s;m had already pa&s;&s;ed the line. The &s;ociety po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Bethlehem in Pen&s;ylvania: it has a &s;ettlement among&s;t the Hottentots. China is entered into its plan. But it has no where made better conque&s;ts than in the Briti&s;h European dominions, in the United Pro|vinces, and in Wetteravia; in the la&s;t province, how|ever, where their views were di&s;covered, they have a|gain lo&s;t ground. They have al&s;o been turned out of
<PB N="345" REF="354">the Dani&s;h dominions, where they had made a &s;ettle|ment.</P>
<P>A di&s;cipline &s;o much overburdened as that of Herrn|huti&s;m, could not very well take place but in a &s;mall &s;ociety; and we find, that in proportion as this &s;ect came to &s;pread abroad, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to forego, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the rigour of its rule, in order to accommodate the in&s;titution to the ta&s;te, hu|mour, and ideas of the new pro&s;elytes. This gave ri&s;e to the modifications, forms, and different u&s;ages now in being among the&s;e &s;ectaries. Count Zinzendorf calls them Tropes, Types, and at this very time there are three of them, viz. the Moravian Trope or Type, which is the mo&s;t ancient; the Lutheran, which ap|pears to him to be the mo&s;t &s;alutary to the children of God; and the Reformed or Calvini&s;t Trope, for which he al&s;o has a great regard, and whereof Mr. de Wat|teville, his &s;on-in-law, was elected Bi&s;hop in 1743. I cannot exactly &s;ay wherein the above three modifica|tions differ from each other: the&s;e are &s;ecrets proba|bly known by the adepts alone. Thus much they have thought fit to acquaint the public with, that the Bohemian confe&s;&s;ion is received by the fir&s;t trope, the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg by the &s;econd, and that of the reformed churches in the United Provinces by the third. Indeed, from the year 1748, Count Zinzen|dorf has made all the tropes receive the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion; however, it is pretended, that this has made no confu&s;ion among the&s;e &s;everal modifications.</P>
<P>Conde&s;cen&s;ion being what has given ri&s;e to the&s;e tropes, Count Zinzendorf, from the &s;ame motive, &s;hews a general inclination to all Chri&s;tian commu|nions. He would have wrote to the Pope, had he known what title to give him. He has even been per&s;ecuted for having maintained, that the Pope was not the Antichri&s;t. He has &s;ent a deputation to the Patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, which has been very well received. He &s;hews a great attachment to Lutheran|i&s;m,
<PB N="346" REF="355">whereof he con&s;tantly pretends him&s;elf to be a member. He boa&s;ts of being a mini&s;ter of that church, and affirms, in &s;pite of all that can be &s;aid to the con|trary, that he and his brethren have no other doctrine than what is taught by that communion&punc; He is of late become more favourable to Calvini&s;m, than he was in the beginning&punc; It was in his power, &s;ays he, to have rooted it out from among the brethren; he however declined it. Although, according to him, the taking of oaths is not prohibited; yet the &s;ociety, wherever it &s;ettles, is known to be aver&s;e to them, and that pro|bably out of complai&s;ance to the Mennoni&s;ts or Ana|bapti&s;ts. He declares in general, that whoever em|braces Herrnhuti&s;m need not change his religion. Such advances as the&s;e cannot but infinitely facilitate the propagation of the &s;ect, which already boa&s;ts of decimating all nations, and pretends it has a right to all the children of God of whatever per&s;ua&s;ion they be.</P>
<P>Though Count Zinzendorf tells us, that he has &s;ome|times met with re&s;i&s;tance from the brethren, and that they have contradicted him; yet it appears in general, that they have &s;hewed great docility both for him and tho&s;e he has been plea&s;ed to make partakers of his au|thority. Submi&s;&s;ion to the will of the &s;uperiors of the &s;ociety, is a very e&s;&s;ential article of his &s;y&s;tem. He teaches, in his &s;ermons to the &s;ynod of Zei&s;t, that God obeys the voice of his &s;ervants (that is to &s;ay, of the brethren); but that it is required, that fir&s;t of all they agree with their friend, that they act in concert with their chief. The tractablene&s;s which he pre&s;cribes them mu&s;t go &s;o far as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led &s;tep for &s;tep, like little children, by men whom he calls mini&s;ters of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of the church, re|pre&s;enting them as being &s;o many living images of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. The irk&s;omene&s;s of thus obeying with|out re&s;erve is great, it mu&s;t be owned; but then it is much alleviated by the notion that is in&s;tilled into them, that their &s;uperiors receive from Chri&s;t him&s;elf
<PB N="347" REF="356">the orders that are given. This the Count inculcates among his flock with equal care and a&s;&s;iduity. Every thing is done by the Saviour's injunction; "Je&s;us will have it &s;o, the Lamb commands it:" this is the &s;tile of the mini&s;ters of the &s;ociety. According to them, the Saviour gives his orders on the very moment they are to be executed. He will not &s;uffer that tho&s;e who are to obey them have time to con&s;ider. "Thus bu|&s;ine&s;s is done quickly, all at once; and, as it were, in po&s;t-ha&s;te." The&s;e are the Count's own expre&s;&s;ions, who looks upon this method of the Saviour, as a con|de&s;cen&s;ion he has for his children, with who&s;e weak|ne&s;s he is not unacquainted. He knows, adds he, for in&s;tance, how it is with a maid, when &s;he is appri&s;ed &s;he is to marry: therefore he doth not willingly let per&s;ons know their de&s;tination much beforehand.</P>
<P>The &s;ending of mi&s;&s;ionaries, according to this &s;ect, is a bu&s;ine&s;s in which the Saviour is particularly con|cerned. Count Zinzendorf informs us minutely what the Saviour pre&s;cribes in this matter. For in&s;tance, &s;ome of the &s;ociety earne&s;tly de&s;iring, that tho&s;e of their brethren, who had been pitched upon to be &s;ent away, &s;hould be di&s;patched a day &s;ooner than the Saviour had appointed: the Count oppo&s;ed this motion with &s;o much &s;teadine&s;s, that it was dropped. It was to no purpo&s;e they objected, that the Captains, who were to take them on board at Rotterdam, would pay no re|gard to the day appointed by the Saviour: he re&s;olute|ly an&s;wered, "They will do it; or if not, our mi&s;&s;i|onaries will come, in another manner, to the place for which they are de&s;tined." This example of the Count's faith will appear le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing, when we attend to what he tells us further, viz. that he has found by expe|rience, that the brethren, when the Saviour directed them in their travels, have performed amazing things, things which no art, no human precaution ever could attain to. He him&s;elf has once, without human a&s;&s;i&s;tance, made a voyage in eleven weeks, which an|other
<PB N="348" REF="357">Herrnhuter could not compa&s;s in le&s;s than &s;ixty-&s;ix, becau&s;e he was in the hands of men. "The Sa|viour (continues this great apo&s;tle, in a prophetical &s;train, in his 33d &s;ermon, preached at Zei&s;t) pro|tects his people in a quite wonderful manner. My wi&s;hes and de&s;ires are, that I could bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g it to pa&s;s, that we could have a couple of &s;hips, no matter of what bulk, that belonged &s;olely to the &s;ociety, and which the maritime powers might not &s;u&s;pect of carrying on a trade, or being employed in &s;muggling; which may be po&s;&s;ible to obtain, and depends only on a favoura|ble moment: then we &s;hould &s;ee wonders. For, at pre&s;ent, our affairs are too much blended with the bu|&s;ine&s;s of men, with their intere&s;t and views; this makes a great alteration, and cannot but have, &s;ome way or other, an influence over the brethren. But were it once to become the Saviour's bu&s;ine&s;s alone, then he would let us &s;ee wonders on the &s;ea. He would not only cau&s;e us to make voyages with great &s;wiftne&s;s, but to land where never any body landed. A tempe&s;t would be &s;ufficient to bring us to the intended place. In ca&s;e leave was denied us to enter a port, we &s;hould be conveyed into &s;ome inacce&s;&s;ible bay, at &s;ome miles di&s;tance from the port, where we might land, and no body could find fault with it, becau&s;e it would ap|pear, that we were arrived there by &s;tre&s;s of weather. This would co&s;t nothing to the Saviour, it would be a play to his angels."</P>
<P>Count Zinzendorf tells us him&s;elf, that the com|mi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ociety was never calculated for a gene|ral conver&s;ion of the Heathen; that the time of this great event is not as yet come; but that the &s;ociety being an <GAP DESC="foreign"> (an election, a cho&s;en people), it mu&s;t have an <GAP DESC="foreign"> (the fir&s;tlings or fir&s;t-fruits) here and there among the Heathen. The little number the brethren have hitherto converted to the Chri&s;tian faith, is but a comfort, which the Saviour has granted them to make them amends for their labours, and they be|lieve
<PB N="349" REF="358">them&s;elves well rewarded for their toil, if in two hundred voyages they make but one hundred converts. He al&s;o tells us, that the Herrnhuters, in order to ac|quire the fir&s;tlings of Pagani&s;m, chu&s;e to look out for them among&s;t tho&s;e Heathen, that have had the lea&s;t or no communication at all with the pretenders to Chri&s;tianity, rather than among the la&s;t.</P>
<P>As the brethren have always a great number of la|bourers on the roads, oftentimes among the&s;e their chief him&s;elf with his family and retinue; and as, be|&s;ides, their undertakings, and the acqui&s;itions they make, require con&s;iderable expence, it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould have what is called the &s;inew of all great &s;chemes, money. Thus we find they have betimes e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund called by them the Lamb's or the Saviour's che&s;t, which is become very con&s;iderable by the con|tributions and donations of the pro&s;elytes of Herrnhu|ti&s;m and its favourers. From the beginning, two brethren were tru&s;ted with it; of whom, one kept the che&s;t, and the other the key; but Count Zinzendorf has always had the principal direction over it. This addi|tion of temporal concerns mu&s;t infallibly have cru&s;hed him under its weight, he being already &s;o much taken up with the &s;piritual ones of the &s;ociety, had he not found in the Counte&s;s, his &s;pou&s;e, a proper a&s;&s;i&s;tant to &s;hare his fatigues with him. In a manu&s;cript hi&s;tory of the &s;ociety, whereof the Count gives us &s;ome ab|&s;tracts in the appendix of his <HI>Natural Reflections,</HI> it is &s;aid, that this Lady, during a time of twenty-&s;ix years, has &s;o well hu&s;banded the &s;canty funds of the &s;ociety, that nothing was ever wanting, either in his family, or among&s;t the brotherhood, though there had been a nece&s;&s;ity of furni&s;hing from thence above one million of crowns for &s;undry undertakings. Upon the whole, it is well known, that whoever de&s;ires to be received as a brother, is not welcome among them, unle&s;s he con|tributes to the che&s;t. The Count &s;ays him&s;elf, "That the oeconomi&s;ts of the &s;ociety may &s;ay to a young rich
<PB N="350" REF="359">man, Either give us all thou ha&s;t, or get thee gone; give us all thou ha&s;t, or thou can&s;t not be with us."</P>
<P>I have already hinted at the rapid progre&s;s made by Herrnhuti&s;m. Here follows another curious detail, which Count Zinzendorf him&s;elf gives us in his <HI>Natu|ral Reflections,</HI> &amp;c. wrote in the years 1748 and 1749. This will &s;hew (if credit may be given to what he &s;ays) what &s;ituation the &s;ect was in at that time. The &s;ociety, &s;ays he, had almo&s;t a thou&s;and labourers di&s;|per&s;ed all over the world. This number, however, was not yet &s;ufficient; for, in proportion as they work|ed, the harve&s;t increa&s;ed. Twenty-four nations had been awakened from their &s;piritual drow&s;ine&s;s, by the care of the&s;e apo&s;tles. "We preach, &s;ays he, to an innumerable number of &s;ouls in fourteen languages, among&s;t whom, without reckoning tho&s;e that do not belong to the Prote&s;tant religion, nor the Jews and Heathens, there are at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and people that were not born Lutherans, whom we neverthele&s;s bring to the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion, and indeed we can|not recommend to them a better con&s;titution, than the church of the brethren. We have, adds he, ninety-eight e&s;tabli&s;hments, among&s;t which are ca&s;tles that have 20, 50, or 90 apartments." The mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Herrnhuters do not go and preach in every place, where their mini&s;try is required. On the 28th of Fe|bruary 1748, they had received above one hundred and &s;eventy invitations, only from Ea&s;ter of the fore|going year, with regard to which they had not as yet taken any re&s;olution. In the mean while they are not idle; in the year 1740, they had already made two hundred voyages by &s;ea. As to the progre&s;s the &s;ect has made abroad for the&s;e three years pa&s;t, I &s;hall not venture to &s;peak of, as I have not &s;ufficient mate|rials for the purpo&s;e; but as for the &s;ucce&s;s they have met with in the&s;e kingdoms, and are daily making, every body is an eye-witne&s;s of. It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="351" REF="360">that their &s;ucce&s;s from the year 1749 mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s that of the two years above-mentioned."</P>
<P>Since the publication of the above account, the Moravians have not, perhaps, increa&s;ed, as the writ|ings of Mr. Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ius, and the narrative of Andrew Frey, have done them great di&s;&s;ervice with the &s;ober part of mankind. They were e&s;tabli&s;hed here, in England, by an act pa&s;&s;ed many years &s;ince

As long as Herrnhut belonged to the church at Berthol&s;|dorf, the &s;ociety was held in great e&s;teem, and not at all &s;u&s;pected to differ from the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg. This was the rea&s;on, for which the theological faculty at Tubingen, did not &s;cruple to grant them tho&s;e te&s;|timonials, to which Count Zinzendorf has &s;ince that time always referred him&s;elf, to prove the &s;oundne&s;s of his doctrine
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">They afterwards, however, pa&s;&s;ed a judgment again&s;t them, viz. in 1747.</NOTE>. I do not know, nor is it material to inquire, whether Count Zinzendorf began to broach his new doctrine, immediately upon the beginning of the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ociety at Herrnhut; it &s;eems more likely, that as he enlarged his plan, he enlarged his notions al&s;o. Thus much is certain, that it is no ea&s;y matter to come at the tenets of this &s;ect, on account of the great ob&s;curity affected by their teachers. They make it their &s;tudy, to &s;peak and write, that they may not be under&s;tood. It is a rule among them, to &s;peak to tho&s;e, that are not initiated
<PB N="352" REF="361">into the my&s;teries of the theology of blood and wounds, that is to &s;ay, their own theology, in a manner, that they may not be able to tell again any thing of what they have heard. They act, &s;ays Count Zinzendorf him&s;elf, in the &s;ame manner as one would do, who, to catch people that are too curious, writes in a charac|ter they are not able to decypher. They &s;ucceed wonderfully in this kind of &s;tile. Sometimes they are quite unintelligible. At other times they begin to expre&s;s them&s;elves clearly, but on a &s;udden become too ob&s;cure to be under&s;tood. They are &s;eldom en|tirely clear, and neverthele&s;s &s;hew often too great a clearne&s;s
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been very apparent to the author of this Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>. For, indeed, tho&s;e things that e&s;cape them, and are ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, do no honour either to their judgment or under&s;tanding. The rea|der will be convinced of it by the &s;pecimens I am go|ing to lay before him. I &s;hall take a great number of them from Count Zinzendorf's theological opinion, and his &s;ermons preached in America, and at Zei&s;t in the province of Utrecht. The&s;e la&s;t, to the number of fifty-&s;ix, were delivered to the &s;ynod of the bre|thren, held at the la&s;t mentioned place in 1746, and are printed and publi&s;hed by the &s;ociety in one vo|lume. The Count has not put his name to it; for, according to a letter, in&s;erted in <HI>Siegfried's be&s;chei|dene Beleuchtung,</HI> directed by him to all Kings, Elec|tors, Princes, &amp;c. he has left off long ago, to put his name to his writings. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to read the&s;e &s;ermons, without perceiving him to be the au|thor; be&s;ides this, he declares him&s;elf very clearly in the preface, where he &s;ays, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the author of the&s;e &s;ermons, is to exerci&s;e the office of Syndic of the &s;ynods, to &s;uperintend the records, to admini&s;ter the liturgy, to prepare matters and propo&s;e them. I the more willingly make u&s;e of the&s;e &s;er|mons, as they have been preached for the in&s;truction
<PB N="353" REF="362">of &s;everal fellow-labourers, Engli&s;h and Dutch, late|ly received among the &s;ect, and &s;ince the preacher propo&s;es there to him&s;elf, to put into a better light certain central ideas, by which one ought to regulate one's actions, words and thoughts. If it be po&s;&s;ible, to meet any where with the tenets of Herrnhuti&s;m, it mu&s;t be in them.</P>
<P>I begin with the idea this &s;ect has of the &s;cripture. Though Count Zinzendorf doth not, as yet, think proper to di&s;own the &s;cripture; yet the indifferent manner, in which he gives his opinion of it, &s;hews what he aims at. He &s;ays in a &s;ermon preached at Philadelphia, that the &s;tile of the &s;cripture is &s;ome|times like that of a carpenter, &s;ometimes like that of a fi&s;herman, or of a toll-gatherer. Chri&s;t him&s;elf had &s;poke very meanly, and u&s;ed many a phra&s;e becoming a pea&s;ant, which is now looked upon to imply &s;ome|thing of quite a different nature, &s;ince we are unac|quainted with the manner of &s;peaking u&s;ed by the journeymen at Nazareth. He pre&s;cribes a method to his mi&s;&s;ionaries, how to deal with the comptrollers of the &s;cripture (by whom he means tho&s;e that de&s;ire proofs of every doctrine out of the &s;cripture) viz. that they ought to prove all &s;uch things by the defects or imperfections of the&s;e writings, which tho&s;e comptrol|lers pretend to make good by the perfection and infal|libility of the &s;cripture. The reading of the &s;cripture appears to him to be more dangerous than u&s;eful to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>According to Count Zinzendorf, the doctrine that God the Father is our Creator, the Son our Redeem|er, and the Holy Gho&s;t our Sanctifier, is a fal&s;e doc|trine, and one of the capital errors that reign in Chri&s;tendom. Creation and &s;anctification ought not to be a&s;cribed to the Father and Holy Gho&s;t. To avoid idolatry, people ought to be taken from the Father and Holy Gho&s;t, and conducted to Chri&s;t, with whom alone we have to do. The ancients never
<PB N="354" REF="363">dreamt of a Trinity; whoever adores the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t, differs not from a &s;ervant of Jupiter, Mercury, Apollo, or of any great hero to whom the ancients gave the title of God. Our great Doctor ap|pears &s;o po&s;itive of the orthodoxy of his new opinion, that he calls the theology received among Chri&s;tians, a dry one, and good for nothing el&s;e than to amu&s;e dogs and &s;wine, unbelievers and Athei&s;ts, invented by the Devil, and that &s;uch as teach it are Satan's pro|fe&s;&s;ors. Satan has thought within him&s;elf, &s;ays he, <HI>Men &s;hall not come to &s;ee the Father,</HI> that is, the true Father, who is the Saviour, according to Count Zin|zendorf: "I'll conduct them round about the Savi|our, I'll repre&s;ent to them a phantom of a Father, and they &s;hall think, as the Jews formerly did, that this is their God; thus the Saviour &s;hall not get them. By this means, I'll keep them in my power, whil&s;t they think within them&s;elves they are very wi&s;e. The mi&s;take among Chri&s;tians, adds he, ari&s;es from their not comprehending, that it is honour enough for the Father, to be the Father of God the Creator of all things, and to be his own and only Father.</P></Q>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t is called by the Herr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">huters, the eternal wife of God, the mother of Chri&s;t, the mother of the faithful, the mother of the church. Count Zin|zendorf, in the &s;ixth part of his <HI>Natural Reflections,</HI> gives a long detail to ju&s;tify this change he makes in the common theology. He looks upon it as important and nece&s;&s;ary; complaining much, that, &s;ince the re|formation, people are in gro&s;s ignorance concerning the per&s;on of the Holy Gho&s;t, and that the divines in this article commit a very palpable omi&s;&s;ion. He adds, that &s;uch as cannot comprehend the my&s;tery of the Trinity in the manner he explains it, want undoubred|ly uprightne&s;s of heart more than under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the Son is chiefly the object of the Herrnhuters wor&s;hip. Though Count Zinzendorf in plain words calls him the Carpenter Je&s;us, having
<PB N="355" REF="364">taken along with him, into his glory, the poor figure he made in this world, yet the mo&s;t tender names are given him. He is called their Lamb, their little Lamb, their little Je&s;us. They make this name of the femi|nine gender, calling him their mother, their Mamma Je&s;ua. The creation, redemption, and &s;anctification is the work of Chri&s;t, but the Father and Holy Gho&s;t <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> to him in all of them, which is the identical word they u&s;e in expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves on this head. "Whoever believes in Chri&s;t, tho' he knows nothing more of the Godhead, will be &s;aved. The Apo&s;tles, to avoid idolatry, had not bapti&s;ed in the name of the Fa|ther, the Son and Holy Gho&s;t, but in Chri&s;t's name on|ly. God had darted his Son as a fla&s;h of lightning, and the Son by his incarnation had made a parenthe&s;is in the Godhead. What in common life is called a grandfather, a father-in-law, &s;uch was the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Son had taken it as a favour, that he was allowed to become man and go out of the Godhead. Chri&s;t had not conquered as God, but as a man, with the &s;ame &s;trength we conquer. God had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ts us al&s;o. Chri&s;t had not had the lea&s;t power more than we have. He had laid a&s;ide his Godhead, and wrought miracles as men are able to do."</P>
<P>They have a great devotion for the five red wounds of the crucifixion, but that which Chri&s;t received in his &s;ide is extolled above all the re&s;t. This is "their favourite wound, the very dear little holy opening, the precious and thou&s;and times pretty little &s;ide." They ki&s;s this wound, they ki&s;s the &s;pear that made it, and would ki&s;s the &s;oldier who&s;e hand conducted the &s;pear; they thank him for it. It is in this opening that the faithful repo&s;es him&s;elf; there he breathes, there he &s;ports, there he lays down, &s;ometimes length-wi&s;e, &s;ometimes cro&s;s-wi&s;e: there is his country, his hou&s;e, his hall, his little bed, his little table: there he eats, there he drinks, there he lives, there he prai&s;es the dear little Lamb.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="365">The Herrnhuters have this di&s;tingui&s;hing character of fanatici&s;m, that they reject rea&s;on, rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy. The children of God do not in&s;truct them|&s;elves out of books. To demon&s;trate religion, to make it as evident as four times four are &s;ixteen, is an u&s;ele&s;s and &s;uperfluous labour. Faith does not require the lea&s;t demon&s;tration. It is brought forth in the heart by the Holy Gho&s;t. The children of God be|lieve, becau&s;e they find plea&s;ure in believing. Ne|verthele&s;s this faith, produced without rea&s;oning, &s;erves them in&s;tead of all other things. No other command|ment &s;hould be preached to men, than that of belie|ving. This is Count Zinzendorf's doctrine.</P>
<P>Regeneration comes of it&s;elf, without our being re|quired to do any thing towards it. It is a capital truth, &s;ays our Moravian Bi&s;hop, that &s;uch as have not received grace, that are not yet children of God, that have not yet a feeling of their reconciliation, that do not know yet upon what terms they are with their Creator and Saviour, ought not to be engaged to pre|pare them&s;elves for it by any action, good works, good re&s;olutions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the foregoing account of the Antinomians.</NOTE>. They mu&s;t be told, that all that has been believed hitherto to be a preparation for coming to God, is rather an hindrance to their &s;alvation. Re|generation is brought about &s;uddenly, all at once. One moment is &s;ufficient to make us free to receive grace, to be transformed to the image of the little Lamb.</P>
<P>A per&s;on regenerated enjoys great liberty. He doth what the Saviour gives him an inclination to do, and what he has no in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ination for, he is not obliged to do. He doth what the Saviour makes him do, for he is the ma&s;ter, in who&s;e power it is to make laws and to repeal them; who at all times can change the oeconomy of &s;alvation; make criminal what was virtuous, and vir|tuous what was criminal.</P>
<P>It is wrong to &s;ay, that a regenerated per&s;on doth
<PB N="357" REF="366">any thing: properly &s;peaking they do nothing. It is the Saviour that acts for them. He is with re&s;pect to the Saviour as a child, who&s;e hand one guides, yet who believes it is him&s;elf that writes, and rejoices at it.</P>
<P>On the great day of judgment, the Herrnhuters will not be placed on the Saviour's left-hand among tho&s;e that are goats; this is to be under&s;tood of cour&s;e. Nor will they be among&s;t tho&s;e called the &s;heep on the right|hand of the judgment &s;eat, a place of honour they look upon too mean to be a&s;&s;igned them. Count Zin|zendorf tells us, that the words, <HI>Holy angels, coming with the Saviour in his glory,</HI> denote the &s;aints coming along with him, and that the Herrnhuters will be tho&s;e &s;aints that accompany him. He adds, that &s;uch as do not die Herrnhuters, will have mercy on that day, provided they think favourably upon their dying bed of tho&s;e belonging to that &s;ect.</P>
<P>The circumci&s;ion of the Saviour has, according to them, &s;erved to &s;hew of what &s;ex he was. It has like|wi&s;e re&s;tored to honour that part of the human body, which, as a con&s;equence of Adam's fall, was become a di&s;grace to it; in&s;omuch, that it is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t noble, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectable part of a man's body. The &s;i&s;ters are exhorted never to think of it, but with &s;entiments of the mo&s;t profound veneration. They are even thought to make a &s;cruple of re&s;pecting men for any other rea&s;on. The organ of generation of the other &s;ex is no le&s;s honourable. It has been &s;anctified by the birth of the Saviour. I abate of the &s;trength of my author's expre&s;&s;ions whil&s;t I abridge him, for fear of offending the mode&s;ty of my readers.</P>
<P>All the &s;ouls are of the feminine &s;ex. There are only <HI>animae,</HI> and no <HI>animi,</HI> &s;ays the Moravian Bi&s;hop with great elegance. To think that there are male-&s;ouls would be, according to this profound divine, the greate&s;t folly, a chimera, which ought not to enter the thoughts of a Chri&s;tian, were he even in the mid&s;t
<PB N="358" REF="367">of an high fever. All that is of the male quality, and was adapted to our body, is detached from it as &s;oon as it is interred. It belongs not to its natural and pri|mitive &s;tate: it is an addition made to it afterwards: it is the &s;eal of the office, which the male &s;ex is in|tru&s;ted with. For, our &s;ex is an employment, an office. Je&s;us is the &s;pou&s;e of all the &s;i&s;ters, and the hu&s;bands, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e, are his procurators, his agents, in every re&s;pect like tho&s;e amba&s;&s;adors in ancient times, who, on marrying a Prince&s;s in the name of their ma&s;ter, put a booted leg in the wedding-bed. A hu&s;|band is al&s;o properly no more than a chamberlain of his wife; his office is but for a time, and <HI>ad interim.</HI> However, the titles which the Count gives him are not le&s;s glorious: he is <HI>Vice-Chri&s;t, Vice-God.</HI> The &s;i&s;ters are conducted to Je&s;us by the mini&s;try of their hu&s;bands, who thus are their &s;aviours in this world. When therefore a marriage is made, what is the rea|&s;on of it? Becau&s;e there was a &s;i&s;ter, who &s;hould be brought to the true &s;pou&s;e by the mediation of &s;uch a procurator. Count Zinzendorf, in a conference on this &s;ubject, held at Oly with the <HI>Seventh-day men,</HI> made u&s;e of the following expre&s;&s;ions, which, to avoid &s;candal as much as po&s;&s;ible, I chu&s;e to give in Latin, viz. <HI>In ip&s;o actu conjugali moriturus, po&s;&s;em dice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Salva|tori: veni de i&s;to actu,</HI> h. e. <HI>quem nomine tuo peregi.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, two con&s;equences natu|rally re&s;ult, which have not e&s;caped the Count. The one is, that whoever knows him&s;elf to be a man, ought to acknowledge the dignity that is in him, and honour the choice that has been made of his per&s;on. The other, that marriage is the mo&s;t precious depo&s;i|tum the Saviour has intru&s;ted with his church; that is to &s;ay, without doubt, to the &s;ociety of Herrnhuters, and the mo&s;t important my&s;tery to which he has given them the key. Con&s;idering this, we cannot at all be &s;urpri&s;ed at being told, that they look upon all that are married out of their &s;ociety to live in fornication and adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="368">The male &s;ex con&s;i&s;ts of married men, unmarried ones, and widowers. According to the primitive plan of the Saviour, all that had pa&s;&s;ed the twentieth or twenty-fir&s;t year &s;hould be married. After the&s;e years, the &s;tate of unmarried people is a bruti&s;h &s;tate, a &s;tate of madne&s;s, where one doth not know one's &s;elf. Be|&s;ides this divi&s;ion of men into three cla&s;&s;es, there is another more general one, by which they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into two choirs. One includes the married people of both &s;exes, and the other the unmarried ones. Count Zinzendorf is not entirely plea&s;ed with either of the choirs, and much le&s;s with the fir&s;t than the &s;e|cond. He rebukes the hu&s;bands, and upbraids them with I do not know what ab&s;traction or remi&s;&s;ne&s;s. In another &s;ermon he ob&s;erves, that when the children of God will not experience phy&s;ically certain things &s;uit|able to a certain age, it is ca&s;ting off human nature, they become unhappy; they forge to them&s;elves chi|meras; they &s;ay, I don't feel the &s;ame thing as other people. This appears a little ob&s;cure, but could per|haps be explained by what the &s;ublime Doctor el&s;e|where relates of a I do not know what mortification, cau&s;ed by I do not know what non-u&s;e.</P>
<P>I would here recommend to my readers a peru&s;al of the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and well-written <HI>Expo&s;tulatory Letter, addre&s;&s;ed to Nicholas Lewis, Count Zinzendorf, and Lord Advocate of the Unitas Fratrum, by George Whitefield, A. B.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>publi&s;hed in</HI> 1753, which will &s;till more elu|cidate what has been &s;aid above, relative to the di&s;ci|pline and tenets of this &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The following account of their belief is &s;omewhat more methodical.</P>
<P>They believe and teach
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We&s;ley's Short View, &amp;c. p. 13.</NOTE>, that Chri&s;t has done all which was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of all mankind; that, con&s;equently, we are to do nothing, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, but &s;imply to believe in him; that there is but one duty now, but one command, <HI>viz.</HI> to be|lieve
<PB N="360" REF="369">in Chri&s;t; that Chri&s;t has taken away all other commands and duties, having wholly aboli&s;hed the law; that a believer is therefore free from the law, is not obliged thereby to do or omit any thing; it being incon&s;i&s;tent with his liberty to do any thing as com|manded; that there is no &s;uch thing as degrees in faith, or weak faith, &s;ince he has no faith who has any doubt or fear; that we are &s;anctified wholly the moment we are ju&s;tified, and are neither more nor le&s;s holy to the day of our death; entire &s;anctification, and entire ju&s;|tification, being in one and the &s;ame in&s;tant: that a believer is never &s;anctified or holy in him&s;elf, but in Chri&s;t only; he has no holine&s;s in him&s;elf at all, all his holine&s;s being imputed, not inherent: that a man may feel peace which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, may rejoice with joy full of glory, and have the love of God and of all mankind, with dominion over all &s;in; and yet all this may be only nature, animal &s;pirits, or the force of imagination: that if a man regards prayer or &s;earching the &s;criptures, or communicating, as mat|ter of duty; if he judges him&s;elf obliged to do the&s;e things, or is troubled when he does them not, he is in bondage, he has no faith at all, but is &s;eeking &s;alva|tion by the works of the law: that therefore, till we believe, we ought to be <HI>&s;till,</HI> i. e. not to pray, &s;earch the &s;criptures, or communicate.</P>
<P>Thus I have given the be&s;t account I can collect of the principles of this very my&s;terious &s;ect, for whom (in the words of Mrs. Le Fevre) <HI>I pity and pray.</HI></P>
<P>I have been acquainted with &s;ome of them, and have found them mode&s;t and inoffen&s;ive in their beha|viour, and much re&s;igned to the ways of Providence. But it is plain they make an idol of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and transfer the love and wor&s;hip due to the &s;upreme God and Father of all, to the Son, as fully appears from the preceding account. In &s;hort, I may &s;ay with Mr. O&s;wald Edwards, when &s;peaking of another &s;ect, <HI>I hate their notions, but love the men.</HI></P>

According to the de&s;cription given of it by Durandus, it &s;eems to have been a kind of linen gar|ment, made &s;it and clo&s;e to the body, like a ca&s;&s;ock, tied round the middle with a girdle or fa&s;h, the &s;leeves being either plain like tho&s;e of a ca&s;&s;ock, or el&s;e gathered clo&s;e at the hands like the &s;leeves of a &s;hirt. The Albs were formerly embroidered with various colours, and adorned with fringes. The &s;urplice, among us, an&s;wers to the Alb; for the fir&s;t rubrick of the common prayer enjoins, that when&s;oever the Bi&s;hop &s;hall celebrate the holy com|munion in the church, or execute any other public mini&s;tration, he &s;hall put upon him, be&s;ide his rochette, a &s;urplice, or Alb.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Albali,</HI> a Chri&s;tian &s;ect in 1399, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by wearing white linen, and bewailing the evils and errors of the age: they u&s;ually carried a crucifix in their hand; but as they vi&s;ited many parts of Italy, it alarmed the Pope, who &s;ent &s;oldi|ers to apprehend and put their prie&s;t to death, and di&s;per&s;e the re&s;t.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> alias <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> a &s;ect of Reformers about Tholou&s;e and the Albigois, in Languedoc, who, in the twelfth century, be|came remarkable for their oppo&s;ition to the di&s;cipline and cere|monies of the church of Rome. Peter Valdo was one of their principal leaders, who &s;old his goods, and di&s;tributed to the poor, then recommended voluntary poverty, great ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s of manners, bapti&s;ed only the adult, and other things, in oppo&s;ition to the church. The Inqui&s;ition court was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t them, in 1204; but that proving in&s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s them, a holy league or croi&s;ade was agreed upon, and the Pope &s;et up his &s;tandard again&s;t them.

This name was confirmed to them by the Pope, who exempted them from the juri&s;diction of the Archbi&s;hop of Milan, and put them under the direction of the regular clerks of St. Paul. The Angelics wear the habit of the Dominicans; they carry on their brea&s;ts a wooden cro&s;s, and on their finger a gold ring, on which, in&s;tead of a precious &s;tone, is the figure of a heart, and a cruci|fix engraven on it. On &s;olemn days they wear on their heads crowns of thorns. Their con&s;titutions were drawn up by the fa|mous St. Charles Barromeo, and confirmed by Pope Urban VIII.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Angelites</HI> held, that the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, are not the &s;ame, that none exi&s;ts of him&s;elf, but that each is God by a par|ticipation of Deity. They believe the worlds were created by angels, and therefore wor&s;hip them.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Arabici,</HI> erroneous Chri&s;tians, who &s;prung up in the third century, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing tenet was, that the &s;oul and body died toge|gether, and ro&s;e again. Eu&s;ebius relates, that a council was called to &s;top the progre&s;s of it, when Origen a&s;&s;i&s;ted at it, and convinced this &s;ect &s;o fully of their error, that they abjured it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Arians,</HI> from Arius, who denied that the Son was God, con&s;ub&s;tan|tial and coequal with the Father; and a&s;&s;erted him to be a crea|ture made out of nothing and in time. This doctrine was con|demned in the Nicene council, A. C. 325: but it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the council of Rimini, A. C. 365. Arius, the principal broacher of this doctrine, died in 336.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Armenians;</HI> there are two kinds, one are Catholics, and &s;ubject to the Pope, and have a Patriarch in Per&s;ia, another in Poland. The other are a peculiar &s;ect in Natolia, and have two Pacriarchs. They believe the divine and human nature united in the Son; that the Holy Gho&s;t proceeded only from the Father; celebrate the &s;acrament with unleavened bread, and deny the body and blood of Chri&s;t to be really in the elements. They receive infants pre|&s;ently after bapti&s;m to the euchari&s;t; deny the virtue of conferring grace to belong to the &s;acrament: they reject purgatory and pray|ing for the dead; they admit of married prie&s;ts; they rebapti&s;e tho&s;e who come to their communion from the Latin church; they fa&s;t in Lent; they fa&s;t at Chri&s;tmas, December 25, and fea&s;t at our Saviour's bapti&s;m: ab&s;tain from eating blood, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Arminians,</HI> &s;ometimes called Remon&s;trants, aro&s;e in Holland by a &s;eparation from the Calvini&s;ts, about the year 1600. Adherents to Arminius, a celebrated profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Leyden. They looked upon the doctrine of the Trinity as a point not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; acknowledged the &s;upremacy of God. They be|lieved that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit of God for promoting faith and holine&s;s is promi&s;ed, and afforded on our &s;incere a&s;king it; but that the &s;cripture does not require us to pray to, nor pay adoration to the Holy Gho&s;t. They al&s;o believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t offered him&s;elf an acceptable &s;acrifice or oblation to God, but not as an adequate &s;atisfaction. They &s;peak very ambiguou&s;ly of the pre&s;cience of God, at lea&s;t Epi&s;copius and &s;ome of them; for Arminius taught that God elected the faithful according to his fore-knowledge. They maintain, that there is an univer&s;al grace given to all men; that every man is a moral agent, at liber|ty to reject or embrace this grace: they di&s;claim all human au|thority over the faith and con&s;ciences of others; and inculcate charity and unity with Chri&s;tians of different denominations.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Arnoldi&s;ts,</HI> a kind of &s;ectaries in the 12th century, &s;o called from their chief, Arnold of Bre&s;&s;e, a great declaimer again&s;t the wealth and vices of the clergy. He is al&s;o charged with preaching again&s;t bapti&s;m and the euchari&s;t, &amp;c. He was burnt at Rome in 1155, and his a&s;hes ca&s;t into the Tiber.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>A&s;h-Wedne&s;day,</HI> the fir&s;t day of Lent. It aro&s;e from a cu&s;tom of the church, of &s;prinkling a&s;hes on the heads of &s;uch as were then ad|mitted to penance. The a&s;hes mu&s;t be made from branches of the olive tree; then they are laid upon the altar, and ble&s;&s;ed by the officiating prie&s;t, afterwards &s;igned with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s; then they are &s;trewed on the heads of the prie&s;ts, and then of the laity. When this ceremony took its ri&s;e, we cannot preci&s;ely de|termine. The u&s;e of a&s;hes, and the ceremonies, were forbidden in England, by order of council, in the reign of Edward VI. 1548. This omi&s;&s;ion is at pre&s;ent &s;upplied by reading publickly, on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, the cur&s;es denounced in the holy &s;criptures again&s;t &s;everal kinds of &s;ins, the people repeating after &s;uch cur&s;e; Amen.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Augu&s;tins,</HI> an order of religious, who ob&s;erve the rule of St. Augu&s;|tin. They are popularly called Au&s;tin friars, and were origi|nally hermits, congregated into one body by Pope Alexander IV. under their general Lanfranc, 1256.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aulic Council,</HI> &s;o called from the Latin, a hall, it being in the hall of the univer&s;ity that this council is generally held; a &s;uperior court or council which has an univer&s;al juri&s;diction, and without appeal, over all the &s;ubjects of the Empire in all proce&s;&s;es enter|ed therein.

<ITEM><HI>Autocephali, Bi&s;hops.</HI> This denomination was given to &s;uch bi&s;hops in the primitive church as were exempted from the juri&s;diction of others. Before the &s;etting up of patriarchs, all metropolitans were accountable to no &s;uperior but a &s;ynod, and even after the advancement of patriarchs, &s;everal metropolitans continued thus
<PB REF="380">independent; this was likewi&s;e a privilege of the ancient Briti&s;h church; in&s;omuch that Dinothus told Au&s;tin, in the name of all the Britannic churches, that they owed no other obedience to the Pope than they did to every godly Chri&s;tian. Be&s;ides the&s;e there were another &s;ort &s;ubject to no metropolitan; but at what time this &s;ort of independent bi&s;hoprics took place, is uncertain.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Auto-de f&eacute;,</HI> or act of faith, is a &s;olemn day held by the inqui&s;ition for the puni&s;hment of heretics, and the ab&s;olution of the innocent accu&s;ed. They u&s;ually contrive the Auto to fall on &s;ome great fe&s;tival, that the execution may pa&s;s with the more awe and re|gard, at lea&s;t it is always on a Sunday. The criminals are fir&s;t led to church, where their &s;entence is read to them, either of con|demnation or ab&s;olution.

But if they per&s;i&s;t in their &s;uppo&s;ed errors, they are burnt alive.

<ITEM><HI>Azymites,</HI> Chri&s;tians who admini&s;ter the euchari&s;t, or holy commu|nion, with unleavened bread. Authors are not agreed as to this being an occa&s;ion of a rupture between the Romi&s;h and Greek church; but Bingham mentions it as his opinion, that the u&s;e of wafers and unleavened bread was not known in the church till the 11th or 12th century, and he tells the following &s;tory in con|firmation of it: As Gregory the Great was admini&s;tering the bread to a certain woman in the u&s;ual form, <HI>the body of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. &s;he fell a laughing, and, being a&s;ked the rea|&s;on of it, &s;aid, becau&s;e he called that the body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which &s;he knew to be bread that &s;he had made with her own hands. Be&s;ides, the ancients &s;ay their bread was common bread, and not objected to till 1051. But this is much more contro|verted by <HI>F. Sirmond,</HI> in a di&s;&s;ertation, wherein he &s;hews, that the Latins had con&s;tantly communicated in leavened bread, till the 10th century; and Thomas Aquinas maintains, that, during the fir&s;t ages of the church, none but unleavened bread was u&s;ed in the church; that the primitive church did it in imitation of our Saviour, who celebrated the la&s;t &s;upper with unleavened bread. Upon the whole, in the council of Florence it was decreed, that the point lay at the di&s;cretion of the church, and that either lea|vened or unleavened bread might be u&s;ed. The We&s;tern church has preferred the latter.</ITEM>

The term &s;ignifies, in the Venetian language, an Elder: the rea&s;on why their mini&s;ters were called by this name, was, that they might thereby conceal their function in remote parts, and times of per&s;ecution. The Barbes made the education of youth, and the &s;uperintendency of the public &s;chools, an important branch of their employment.

<PB REF="382">foundation of that intimate friend&s;hip which was afterwards con|tracted between this Apo&s;tle and St. Paul. The time of his con|ver&s;ion is uncertain; but he is generally e&s;teemed one of the &s;even|ty di&s;ciples cho&s;en by our Saviour him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Barnabites,</HI> an order of religious, thus called from the church of St. Barnabas at Milan, where they were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; and not, as &s;ome have imagined, becau&s;e St. Barnabas was their pa|tron; in reality St. Paul is the patron of the Barnabites. The Barnabites are regular prie&s;ts of the congregation of St. Paul. Their habit is black, and the &s;ame with that they wore when fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, in 1533, by the expre&s;s bulls of Pope Cle|ment VII. Their office is to in&s;truct, catechi&s;e, and &s;erve in mi&s;&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>St. Bartholomew's Day,</HI> a fe&s;tival of the Chri&s;tian church, celebrated on the 24th of Augu&s;t. St. Bartholomew was one of the twelve Apo&s;tles, and is e&s;teemed to be the &s;ame as Nathaniel, one of the fir&s;t di&s;ciples that came to Chri&s;t. The rea&s;on of this opinion is, becau&s;e, as St. John never mentions Bartholomew in the num|ber of the Apo&s;tles, &s;o the other Evangeli&s;ts never mention Na|thaniel; and as, in St. John, Philip and Nathaniel are joined to|gether in their coming to Chri&s;t, &s;o, in the re&s;t of the Evange|li&s;ts, Philip and Bartholomew are con&s;tantly put together. What renders this &s;till more probable, is, that Nathaniel is particularly mentioned among the Apo&s;tles, to whom our Lord appeared at the &s;ea of Tiberias, after his re&s;urrection, where were pre&s;ent Simon Peter, Thomas, and Nathaniel of Cana in Galli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee, and the two &s;ons of Zebedee, and two other of his di&s;ciples, who were probably Andrew and Philip.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bartholomites,</HI> a religious order, founded at Genoa in the year 1307. In 1296, the Sultan of Egypt coming into Armenia, committed great cruelties in that country, and particularly per&s;ecuted the monks of St. Ba&s;il, &s;ettled at Monte Negro, many of whom &s;uf|fered martyrdom, and others e&s;caped it by flight. Some of the latter flying into Europe, came to Genoa, under the conduct of one Father Martin. They were well received, and offered a &s;et|tlement in that city.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> St. order of, the mo&s;t ancient of all the religious orders, ta|king its name from St. Ba&s;il, Bi&s;hop of Cae&s;area, about the mid|dle of the fourth century.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ba&s;ilidians,</HI> a &s;ect &s;o called from Ba&s;ilides, in the &s;econd century, and cotemporary with Saturninus, who flouri&s;hed at Antioch, Ba&s;ilides in Alexandria. The peculiar tenets he held were, that the &s;upreme God, whom he &s;tiled <HI>Abraxas,</HI> begot the <HI>thais</HI> or under&s;tanding; from the <HI>thais</HI> was the <HI>Logos</HI> cerived, from the <HI>Logos phrene&s;is,</HI> or (as Tertullian tran&s;lates it) Providence, from <HI>phrene&s;is &s;ophia,</HI> and <HI>dynamis,</HI> i. e. wi&s;dom and power; from <HI>&s;o|phia</HI> and <HI>dynamis</HI> &s;prung powers, principalities, and angels, whom he calls the fir&s;t, by which angels were the fir&s;t heaven

<ITEM><HI>Beatification,</HI> in the Romi&s;h church, the act whereby the Pope de|clares the per&s;on happy after death. It differs from canoniza|tion; in the former, the Pope does not act as a judge in deter|mining the &s;tate of the beatified, but only grants a privilege to certain per&s;ons to honour him by a particular religious wor&s;hip, without incurring the penalty of &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hippers; but in canonization, the Pope &s;peaks as a judge, and determines <HI>ex ca|thedra</HI> upon the &s;tate of the canonized. It was introduced, when it was thought proper to delay the canonization of &s;aints, for the greater a&s;&s;urance of the truth, and manife&s;tation of the rigo|rous &s;teps taken in the procedure.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Beghardi,</HI> Beguardi, or Begghardi, the name of an heretical &s;ect in Germany, which &s;prung up towards the end of the 13th century. Their head was one Dulcinus. Their principal tenets were, that man, in this life, might be impeccable, and that he might ri&s;e to a degree of perfection not to be exceeded; that this &s;tate is as happy as heaven, which, when once obtained, men are no long|er obliged to ob&s;erve the fa&s;ts of the church, nor obey their &s;upe|riors; that every intellectual creature is &s;elf-happy; they di&s;re|garded good works, as of no avail to &s;alvation, and took great pains to &s;pread abroad their impious doctrines. The&s;e fanatics, who wore the habit of monks, without paying regard to any other rule, or ob&s;erving celibacy, were condemned under Pope Clement V. at the council of Vienna, in 1311.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Beguins,</HI> devout &s;ocieties of young women, e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;everal parts of Flanders, Picardy, and Lorrain, who maintain them|&s;elves by the work of their own hands, leading a middle kind of life, between the &s;ecular and religious, but make no vows.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Benedictius,</HI> or Benedictin order, is an order of monks, who profe&s;s to follow the u&s;es of St. Benedict.

<ITEM><HI>Berengarians,</HI> a religious &s;ect in the eleventh century, which adher|ed to the opinions of Berengarius, archdeacon of Angers, who, in the year 1035, began to propagate his doctrine concern|ing the euchari&s;t, in a manner agreeable to the tenets, not only of Bertram and Scotus, but of the whole primitive church; a&s;|&s;erting, that the bread and wine in the Lord's &s;upper is not really and e&s;&s;entially, but only figuratively, changed into the body and blood of Chri&s;t. Several of the monks &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed Be|rengarius: at length, in the year 1050, he was condemned in a &s;ynod held at Rome by Pope Leo IX. and excommunicated: as he was al&s;o the &s;ame year in a &s;ynod held at Verceil in Piedmont, and in another held at Tours in Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at which Lanfranc, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a&s;&s;i&s;ted. In the year 1059. Berenga|rius maintained his opinion in a &s;ynod held at Rome before Pope Nicholas II. His followers were divided on the head of the eu|chari&s;t, but they all agreed that the bread and wine were not e&s;&s;en|tially changed, &s;ome allowing that the body and blood of Chri&s;t were contained in them, tho' concealed under an impanation; others denying any change at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bernardins,</HI> or <HI>Bernardites,</HI> a Chri&s;tian fect, extended over a great part of Europe, being an improvement on the order of St. Be|nedict, fir&s;t made by Robert, abbot de Moleme, and further re|formed by St. Bernard, abbot de Clervaux, whence they take their name.&mdash;Their u&s;ual habit is a white gown, with a black &s;capula|ry; but when they officiate, they put on a large white cowl with great &s;leeves, and a hood of the &s;ame colour.&mdash;They differ very little from the Ci&s;tercians: they had their origin toward the beginning of the twelfth century.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bethlchemites,</HI> a Chri&s;tian &s;ect, called &s;tar-bearers, becau&s;e they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a red &s;tar, having five rays, which they wore on their brea&s;t, in memory of the &s;tar which appeared to the wife men, and conducted them to Bethlehem. Several au|thors have mentioned this order, but none have told us their ori|gin, nor where their convents were &s;ituated, if we except Mat|thew Paris, who &s;ays, that in the year 1257 they obtained a &s;ettlement in England, which was at Cambridge, in Trumping|ton-&s;treet.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P><HI>Bible.</HI> This word comes from the Greek Biblos, which &s;ignifies a book: we give this name to the collections of the &s;acred writ|ings, and call it Bible or book, by way of eminence and di&s;|tinction; the Hebrews call it <HI>Mikra</HI> which &s;ignifies le&s;&s;on, lec|ture or &s;cripture.&mdash;The books of the Old Te&s;tament were writ|ten chiefly in Hebrew; there are &s;ome parts of Daniel written in Chaldee, but for the book of Wi&s;dom it was never written in any other than in Greek.</P>
<P><PB REF="385">The books of the New Te&s;tament were all written in Greek, except St. Matthew, which was written in Hebrew, that is to &s;ay in Syriac, which was the language &s;poken at that time in Judea; but it is di&s;puted whether St. Mark wrote in Greek or Latin, and whether the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews was not at fir&s;t written in He|brew; but it appears mo&s;t certain that they were originally com|po&s;ed in Greek.</P>

He met with great oppo&s;ition and per&s;ecution.

<ITEM><HI>Bons Fieux,</HI> in Engli&s;h, good &s;ons, a congregation of religious, of the third order of St. Francis, &s;o called; it was founded at Armantieres, a little town of Flanders upon the Lis, in the year 1615, by five pious arti&s;ans, the olde&s;t of whom was named Hen|ry Pringuel, a native of that town; they lived in common, and formed a little community in a hou&s;e belonging to Pringuel; their habit was black, and not di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of &s;eculars; three of them &s;pent their time in making linen cloth, one taught youth, and the fifth made lace: thus they lived till the year 1626, when they embraced the third rule of St. Francis, their order in|crea&s;ed, and, in 1670, it con&s;i&s;ted of two congregations, that of Armantieres, and that of Li&s;le, in the dioce&s;e of Tournay: in 1679, they made a third &s;ettlement at St. Venant, in the dioce&s;e of St. Omer.

The in&s;titution of lay brothers began in the eleventh century; the per&s;ons on whom this title and office were conferred, were too ignorant to become clerks, and therefore ap|plied them&s;elves wholly to bodily work, in which they expre&s;&s;ed that zeal for religion, which could not exert it&s;elf in &s;piritual ex|erci&s;es.&mdash;In the nunneries, there are al&s;o lay &s;i&s;ters, who are re|tained in the convent for the &s;ervice of the nuns, in like manner as the lay brothers are for the monks.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Bull,</HI> a written letter, di&s;patched, by order of the Pope, from the Roman chancery, and &s;ealed with lead. It is a kind of apo&s;toli|cal re&s;cript, or edict, and is chiefly in u&s;e in matters of ju&s;tice and grace. If the former be the intention of the bull, the lead is hung by a hempen cord; if the latter, by a &s;ilken thread. It is this pendent lead, or &s;eal, which is, properly &s;peaking, the bull, and which is impre&s;&s;ed on the one &s;ide with the head of St. Peter and St. Paul, and on the other with the name of the Pope, and the year of his pontificate.

They were a branch of the Hu&s;&s;ites, or followers of John Hu&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Caloyers,</HI> a general name given to the monks of the Greek church. The&s;e religious con&s;ider St. Ba&s;il as their father and founder, and look upon it as a crime to follow any other rule than his. There are three degrees among them, the novices, who are called Archari; the ordinary profe&s;&s;ed, called Microchemi; and the more perfect, called Magalochemi. They are likewi&s;e divided into Coenobites, Anchorets, and Reclu&s;e. In the mona&s;teries, the religious ri&s;e at midnight, and repeat a particular office, called from thence Me&s;onycticon, which takes up the &s;pace of two hours; after which they retire to their cells, till five o'clock in the morn|ing, when they return to the church to &s;ay mattins. At nine o'clock, they repeat the terce, &s;exte, and ma&s;s; after which they repair to the refectory, where is a lecture read till dinner. At four o'clock in the afternoon they &s;ay ve&s;pers; and at &s;ix go to &s;upper. After &s;upper they &s;ay an office, from thence called Apodipho, and, at eight, each monk retires to his chamber and bed, till midnight. Every day, after mattins, they confe&s;s their faults, on their knees, to their &s;uperior. They have four Lents; the fir&s;t and greate&s;t is that of the re&s;urrection of our Lord: they call it the Grand Quarantain, and it la&s;ts eight weeks. During this Lent, the religious drink no wine, and their ab&s;tinence is &s;o great, that, if they are obliged in &s;peaking to name milk, butter, or chee&s;e, they always add this aparenthe&s;is, "Timitis a gias &s;aroco&s;tis;" <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;ave the re&s;pect due to holy Lent. The &s;econd Lent is that of the holy Apo&s;tles, which begins eight days after Whit&s;untide; its duration is not fixed, it continuing &s;ometimes three weeks, and at other times longer. During this Lent, they are allowed to drink wine. The third Lent is that of the A&s;&s;ump|tion of our Lady, it la&s;ts fourteen days: during which they ab&s;tain from fi&s;h, excepting on Sundays, and the day of the transfigu|ration of our Lord. The fourth Lent is that of Advent, which they ob&s;erve after the &s;ame manner as that of the Apo&s;tles. The Caloyers, be&s;ides the u&s;ual habit of the mona&s;tic life, wear over their &s;houlders a &s;quare piece of &s;tuff, on which are repre&s;ented the cro&s;s, and the other marks of the pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour, with the&s;e letters, JC.

<ITEM><PB REF="388"><HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> the doctrine and &s;entiments of Calvin and his followers, with regard to matters of religion. Calvini&s;m &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in its great|e&s;t purity in the city of Geneva, whence it was propagated over France, the United Provinces, and England. In France it was aboli&s;hed by the revocation of the edict of Nantz in 1685. It has been the prevailing religion in the United Provinces ever &s;ince the year 1572. In England it has dwindled &s;ince the time of Queen Elizabeth, and is now chiefly confined among the Di&s;|&s;enters; though it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, a little allayed, in the articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and in its rigour in Scotland. Of the thirteen Swi&s;s Cantons there are &s;ix who profe&s;s Calvini&s;m, which likewi&s;e obtains in the Palatinate; except that of late, Popery is there become the reigning religion. The di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets of Calvini&s;m are, 1&s;t, That prede&s;tination and reprobation are prior to the pre&s;cience of good or evil works. 2dly, That prede&s;tination and reprobation depend on the mere will of God, without any re|gard to the merits or demerits of mankind. 3dly, That God gives to tho&s;e, whom he has prede&s;tinated, a faith which they can|not lo&s;e: a nece&s;&s;tating grace, which takes away the freedom of the will; and that he imputes no &s;in to them. 4thly, That the righteous cannot do any good work, by rea&s;on of original &s;in, which cleaves to them. 5thly, That men are ju&s;tified by faith only. The modern Calvini&s;ts reject or palliate &s;ome of the&s;e arti|cles. In France the Calvini&s;ts are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Huguenots; and, among the common people, by that of Parpail|lots. In Germany they are confounded with the Lutherans, un|der the general title Prote&s;tants; only &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name Reformed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Camaldolites,</HI> or Camaldules, a religious order founded by St. Romuald, a native of Ravenna, and de&s;cended from the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of its Dukes. Romuald had ta&s;ted all the plea&s;ures, and pa&s;&s;ed through all the vices, incident to youth; but continual re|mor&s;e of con&s;cience determined him at la&s;t to renounce the world, and dedicate him&s;elf wholly to God and religion: for which pur|po&s;e he retired to Mount Ca&s;&s;in, where the conver&s;ation of a re|ligious, whom he met with there, confirmed him in his re&s;olution, and induced him to take the habit in that mona&s;tery. The man|ner of life, which he enjoined his di&s;ciples to ob&s;erve, was this: they dwelt in &s;eparate cells, and met together only at the times of prayer; &s;ome of them during the two Lents of the year, ob&s;erved an inviolable &s;ilence, and others for the &s;pace of an hundred days.

The Cameronians, in the fury of their zeal, &s;eparated from the kirk. They affirmed, that the King had forfeited his right to the crown by breaking the &s;olemn league and covenant, which were the terms on which he received it. They pretended both to dethrone and excommunicate him, and broke out into an open rebellion, which was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the Duke of Monmouth, at Bothwell|bridge. Upon the Revolution they were reconciled to the kirk, and the preachers of their party &s;ubmitted to the general a&s;&s;embly of the church of Scotland, in 1690.

<ITEM><HI>Canon.</HI> This term &s;ignifies rule, according to the import of the Greek.

The ancient canon, or catalogue of the books of the Old Te&s;tament, was made by the Jews, and is ordinarily attributed to E&s;dras. This is the canon allowed to have been fol|lowed by the primitive church till the council of Carthage, and according to St. Jerom con&s;i&s;ted of no more than twenty-two books. But that council enlarged the canon very con&s;iderably, taking into it the books which we call the Apocrypha; which the council of Trent have farther inforced, injoining all the&s;e to be received as books of holy &s;cripture, upon pain of anathema, and being attainted of here&s;y.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Canonization,</HI> a declaration of the Pope, whereby, after a great deal of &s;olemnity, they enter into the li&s;t of the &s;aints &s;ome per&s;on who has lived an exemplary live, and wrought miracles. The word ca|nonization &s;eems to be of later origin than the thing; there being
<PB REF="390">no in&s;tance of the u&s;e of the word before the 12th century: where|as St. Uldaricus was canonized in the tenth. The name is from canon, in regard the primitive canonizations were only orders of the Popes or Bi&s;hops, whereby per&s;ons eminent for piety, &amp;c. were inferred in the canon of the ma&s;s, that they might be commemo|rated in the &s;ervice, for that in tho&s;e days the u&s;e of martyrolo|gies was unknown in the church. Mabillon di&s;tingui&s;hes two kinds of canonization, a general and particular: the fir&s;t made by a general council, or a Pope; the &s;econd by a Bi&s;hop, a particular church, or a provincial council. There are in&s;tances likewi&s;e of canonization, at lea&s;t &s;omething very like them, by Abbots. At fir&s;t only martyrs were canonized; by degrees they came to con|fe&s;&s;ors. It is di&s;puted whether the martyrdom does not &s;upply the want of miracles. Canonization anciently con&s;i&s;ted in in&s;erting the &s;aint's name in the &s;acred Diptychs, or canon of &s;aints; in ap|pointing a proper office for invoking him, and erecting churches under his invocation, with altars for ma&s;s to be celebrated on; taking up the body from the fir&s;t place of its burial, and the like ceremonies. By degrees, other formalities were added; pro|ce&s;&s;ions made with the &s;aint's image in triumph, the day of his death is declared a fea&s;t; and, to render the thing &s;till more &s;olemn, Honorius III. in 1225, added &s;everal days indulgence to a canonization.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Canons,</HI> a particular order of religious, di&s;tinct from monks. Their original can be carried no higher than the fourth century, and is unanimou&s;ly a&s;cribed to the famous St. Augu&s;tin, Bi&s;hop of Hippo, in Africa, who fir&s;t pre&s;cribed a way of living to clerks, who would voluntarily live in common, and po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing, after the example of the monks.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Capuchins,</HI> religious of the order of St. Francis, in its &s;tricte&s;t ob|&s;ervance. The Capuchins are thus called, from <HI>capuce</HI> or <HI>capu|chon,</HI> a &s;tuff cap or cowl, wherewith they cover their heads. They are cloathed with brown or grey, always bare-footed, are never to go in a coach, nor ever &s;have their beard. The Capu|chins are a reform made from the Minors, commonly called <HI>Cor|deliers,</HI> &s;et on foot in the &s;ixteenth century by Matthew Ba&s;chi, a religious ob&s;ervant of the mona&s;tery of Montefia&s;cone, who, being a Roman, was adverti&s;ed &s;everal times from heaven to prac|ti&s;e the rule of St. Francis to the latter. Upon this he made ap|plication to Pope Clement, in 1525, who gave him permi&s;&s;ion to retire into a &s;olitude, and not only him, but as many others as would embrace the &s;trict ob&s;ervance, which &s;ome did accordingly. In 1528, they obtained the Pope's bull; in 1529, the order was brought into complete form. Matthew was elected General, and the chapter made con&s;titutions. In 1543, the right of preaching was taken from the Capuchins by the Pope; but, in 1545, it was re&s;tored to them again with honour. In 1578, there were al|ready &s;eventeen general chapters in the order of Capuchins.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="391"><HI>Cardinal,</HI> is more particularly u&s;ed for an eccle&s;ia&s;tic Prince, one who has a voice both active and pa&s;&s;ive in the Roman conclave, at the election of a Pope. Some &s;ay the Cardinals were &s;o called from the Latin, <HI>incardinatio,</HI> which &s;ignifies the adoption any church made of a prie&s;t of a foreign church, driven thence by misfortune; and add, that the u&s;e of the word commenced at Rome and Ravenna; the revenues of the churches of which cities being very great, they became the common refuge of the unhap|py prie&s;ts of all other churches. The Cardinals compo&s;e the Pope's council or &s;enate in the Vatican; are a con&s;titution of Pope John, which regulates the rights and titles of Cardinals; in which he declares, that as the Pope repre&s;ents Mo&s;es, &s;o the Cardinals re|pre&s;ent the &s;eventy di&s;ciples, who, under the Pontifical authori|ty, decide private and particular differences. Cardinals, in their fir&s;t in&s;titution, were only the principal prie&s;ts, or incumbents of the pari&s;hes of Rome. In the primitive church, the chief prie&s;t of a pari&s;h, who immediately followed the Bi&s;hop, was called <HI>presbyter cardinalis,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the other petty prie&s;ts, who had no church nor preferment. The term was fir&s;t applied to them in the year 150; others &s;ay, under Pope Silve&s;ter, in the year 300. The&s;e Cardinals alone were allowed to bapti&s;e, and admini&s;ter the euchari&s;t. When the Cardinal prie&s;ts became Bi&s;hops, their cardinalate became vacant, they being then &s;up|po&s;ed to be rai&s;ed to a higher dignity. Under Pope Gregory, Cardinal prie&s;ts and Cardinal deacons were only &s;uch prie&s;ts or deacons as had a church or chapel under their care; and this was the original u&s;e of the word. Leo IV. in the council of Rome held in 853, calls them <HI>presbyteros &s;ui cardinalis,</HI> and their church is <HI>parochios cardinales.</HI> The Cardinals continued on this footing till the eleventh century; but as the grandeur of his &s;tate and Holine&s;s became exceedingly augmented, he would have his coun|cil of Cardinals make a better figure than the ancient prie&s;ts had done. It is true, they &s;till pre&s;erved their ancient title; but the thing expre&s;&s;ed by it was no more. It was a good while, how|ever, ere they had the precedence over Bi&s;hops, or got the elec|tion of the Pope into their hands; but when they were once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e privileges, they &s;oon had the red hat and purple, and, growing &s;till in authority, became at length &s;uperior to the Bi&s;hops, by the &s;ole quality of being Cardinals.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Carmelites,</HI> an order of religious, making one of the four tribes of Mendicants or begging friars, and taking both its name and ori|ginal from Carmel, a mountain of Syria, formerly inhabited by the prophets Elias and Eli&s;ha, and by the children of the prophets, from whom this order pretends to de&s;cend in an uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. The manner in which they make out their antiquity has &s;omething too ridiculous to be rehear&s;ed. Some among them pretend they are de&s;cendants from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; others go far|ther;
<PB REF="392">and makes Pythagoras a Carmelite, and the ancient Druids regular branches of their order.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Carpocratians,</HI> a branch of the ancient Gno&s;tics, &s;o called from Car|pocrates, who, in the &s;econd century, revived and improved upon the errors of Simon Magus, Menander, Saturninus, and other Gno&s;tics. He owned with them one &s;ole Principal and Father of all things, who&s;e name, as well as nature, was unknown. The world, he taught, was created by angels, va&s;tly inferior to the fir&s;t principle. He oppo&s;ed the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, making him a mere man, begotten carnally on the body of Mary by Jo|&s;eph, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon gifts, which &s;et him above other creatures. He inculcated a community of women, and taught, that the &s;oul could not be purified till it had committed all kinds of abominations, making that a nece&s;&s;ary condition of per|fection.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> an order of religious, in&s;tituted by S. Bruno about the year 1086, remarkable for the au&s;terity of their rule, which obliges them to a perpetual &s;olitude, a total ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h, even at the peril of their lives, and ab&s;olute &s;ilence, except at cer|tain &s;tated times. Their hou&s;es were u&s;ually built in de&s;erts, their fare coar&s;e, and di&s;cipline &s;evere. It is ob&s;erved, that the mona&s;tical piety is better pre&s;erved in this than in any of the others. M. l'Abbe de la Trappe, however, endeavours to &s;hew, that the Carthu&s;ians do not live up to the au&s;terity enjoined by the ancient &s;tatutes of Guigues, their fifth general. M. Ma&s;&s;on, at pre&s;ent general of the order, an&s;wers that abbot, and &s;hews, that what he calls the &s;tatutes or con&s;titutions of Guigues, are in rea|lity only cu&s;toms compiled by Father Guigues, and that they did not become laws till long after.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Catechi&s;m, catechi&s;e,</HI> are Greek terms, which &s;ignify in&s;truction, to in&s;truct.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Catechi&s;t,</HI> he who in&s;tructs.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Catechumen,</HI> the per&s;on to be in&s;tructed, in order to his being ad|mitted a member of the Chri&s;tian church.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cathedral,</HI> a church wherein a Bi&s;hop has a &s;ee or &s;eat. The deno|mination <HI>cathedral</HI> &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e from the manner of &s;itting in the ancient churches, or a&s;&s;emblies of primitive Chri&s;|tians. In the&s;e, the council, <HI>i. e.</HI> the elders and prie&s;ts, was called <HI>presbyterium.</HI> At their head was the Bi&s;hop, who held the place of chairman, <HI>cathedralis,</HI> or <HI>cathedraticus;</HI> and the Pre&s;by|ters, who &s;at on either &s;ide, were al&s;o called by the ancient fa|thers <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ores Epi&s;coporum.</HI> The Epi&s;copal authority did not re|&s;ide in the Bi&s;hop alone, but in all the Pre&s;byters, whereof the Bi&s;hop was Pre&s;ident. A cathedral therefore originalty was dif|ferent from what it is now, the Chri&s;tians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il the time of Con|&s;tantine, having no lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rty to build any temple. By their church|es they only meant their a&s;&s;emblies, and by cathedrals nothing more than con&s;i&s;tories. Whence appears the vanity of &s;ome au|thors,
<PB REF="393">e&s;pecially the Spaniards, who pretend their cathedrals to have been built in the time of the Apo&s;tles.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Catholic.</HI> This term is originally Greek; it &s;ignifies univer&s;al or general. Thus the church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is called catholic, be|cau&s;e it extends throughout the world, and is not limited to time or place. In the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word, there is no Catholic church in being, that is, no univer&s;al communion; and there|fore, when, in rehear&s;ing the Apo&s;tles creed, we profeis to be|lieve <HI>the holy Catholic,</HI> we mu&s;t mean (as Mr. Chillingworth ex|pre&s;&s;es it) the right that the church of Chri&s;t, or rather (to &s;peak properly) the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, hath to be univer&s;ally believed; and therefore the article may be true, though there were no Chri&s;|tian church in the world.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cerdonians,</HI> a &s;ect of erroneous Chri&s;tians in the fir&s;t century, who e&s;pou&s;ed mo&s;t of the opinions of Simon Magus and the Maniche|ans. He a&s;&s;erted two principles, a good and a bad; the fir&s;t he called the Father of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the latter the Creator of the world. He denied the incarnation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, rejected the books of the Old Te&s;tament. He likewi&s;e denied the re&s;urrection. His di&s;ciple, Marcion, e&s;pou&s;ed and propagated the &s;ame &s;enti|ments.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cerinthians,</HI> ancient heretics, who denied the deity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They took their name from Cerinthus, one of the fir&s;t heretics in the church, he being co-temporary with St. John. Cerinthus was a zealous defender of the circumci&s;ion, as well as the Naza|renes and Ebionites. St. Epiphanius &s;ays, he was the head of a faction which ro&s;e at Jeru&s;alem again&s;t St. Peter, on account of &s;ome circumci&s;ed per&s;ons, with whom that Apo&s;tle had eat. He believed that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a mere man, born of Jo&s;eph and Mary, but, in his bapti&s;m, a cele&s;tial virtue de&s;cended on him in form of a dove, by means whereof he was con&s;ecrated by the Holy Spirit, and made Chri&s;t. It was by this cele&s;tial virtue, therefore, that he wrought &s;o many miracles, which, as he re|ceived it from heaven, quitted him after his pa&s;&s;ion, and returned to the place where it came; &s;o that Je&s;us, whom he called a pure man, really died and ro&s;e again; but that Chri&s;t, who was di&s;|tingui&s;hed from Je&s;us, did not &s;uffer at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ce&s;arins,</HI> or Cae&s;arians. A religious order, being a reform of that of St. Francis, who began to erect one with &s;uch magnificence, (for which he exacted large contributions of the order) as was neither &s;uitable to the humility which that &s;aint had made pro|fe&s;&s;ion of, nor to the poverty which he had enjoined his followers.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ce&s;tertian Monks.</HI> A religious order founded in the 9th century, by St. Robert, a benedictin, and abbot of Moleme. Certain an|chorets of a neighbouring fore&s;t, having heard of St. Robert (then abbot of St. Michael de la Tonne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) intreated him to take upon him the direction of them; but the prior of his mona&s;tery, and &s;ome of the ancient monks, ob&s;tructed his complying with
<PB REF="394">their reque&s;t. Tho&s;e monks of Tonnere lived under &s;o great a relaxation of di&s;cipline, that the abbot lo&s;t all hopes of reforming them, and therefore left them, and retired to the Abbey of Mon|tier-la-celle, in which he had formerly been a monk. Soon after he was cho&s;en prior of the mona&s;tery of St. Augulphus, which was dependent on that Abbey; then it was, that the afore-named anchorets applied them&s;elves to the Pope, who granted them a brief which directed the abbot of Montier-la-celle to deliver Ro|bert to them, they having made choice of him to govern them. Robert was well plea&s;ed with the Pope's order, and accordingly joined tho&s;e anchorets, whom he led into the fore&s;t of Moleme, where they built them&s;elves little cells made of the boughs of trees, and a little oratory, in honour of the Holy Trinity; but the&s;e hermits falling into relaxation, and Robert not being able to reclaim them, he left them, and retired to a de&s;ert, called Haur, where there were religious men who lived in much unity and &s;implicity of heart, and who cho&s;e him for their abbot; but tho&s;e of Moleme made u&s;e of the authority of the Pope, to oblige him to return, and govern them as he had done before.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chalice,</HI> the cup or ve&s;&s;el, u&s;ed to admini&s;ter the wine in, in the euchari&s;t, and, by the Romani&s;ts, in the ma&s;s. Bede affirms, that the chalice, u&s;ed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t at the &s;upper, had two handles, and held ju&s;t half a pint, which the ancients imitated; but, in the modern times, they are generally made of &s;ilver or gold.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chapter,</HI> Capitulum, a community of eccle&s;ia&s;tics belonging to a ca|thedral or collegiate church. The chief or head of the chapter is the dean; the body con&s;i&s;ts of canons or prebendaries. The chapter has now no longer &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of the dic|ce&s;e, during the life of the Bi&s;hop; but &s;ucceeds to the whole Epi&s;copal juri&s;diction during the vacancy of the &s;ee. The ori|gin of the chapters is derived from hence; that anciently the Bi&s;hops had their clergy re&s;iding with them in their cathedrals, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in performance of &s;acred offices, and in the government of the church; and even after parochical &s;ettlements were made, there were &s;till a body of clerks who continued with the Bi&s;hops, and were indeed his family, maintained out of his income.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Charity of our Lady</HI> (Religious Ho&s;pitallers, called the Order of) This order was founded about the end of the 13th century. Guy, Lord of Toinville, in France, having built, on his own lands, in a place called Boucheraumont, in the dioce&s;e of Chalons, an ho&s;pital for the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;ick and the poor, gave the care of it to &s;ome &s;ecular per&s;ons, who formed a community among them&s;elves, and took the Holy Virgin for their patrone&s;s; and, as charity was the principal motive of their union, the ho&s;pital was named the Charity of our Lady. Soon after their Founder procured them a new &s;ettlement at P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ris, and, in the year 1300. Pope Boniface VIII. confirmed this order, and honoured it with the protection of the holy &s;ee. The religious of this order ob|&s;erved
<PB REF="395">the third rule of St. Francis. Philip the Fair, in 1299, gave them a hou&s;e adjoining to their church. They had &s;eve|ral convents in different parts of the kingdom; but in length of time the&s;e religious growing di&s;orderly and irregular, their order dwindled, and at la&s;t became extinct. In 1631, their convent at Paris was given to the Carmelites, which was confirmed by let|ters-patent of King Lewis XIII.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Charity of St. Hippolytus</HI> (Religious Ho&s;pitallers of that order) A|bout the year 1585, in the pontificate of Gregory XIII. one Ber|nardin Alvarez, a Mexican, founded an ho&s;pital at a little di&s;|tance from the city of Mexico, with the permi&s;&s;ion of the Arch|bi&s;hop, and dedicated it to the honour of St. Hippolytus the Martyr, Patron of the city of Mexico. Bernardin drew up con|&s;titutions for the government of tho&s;e who joined them&s;elves with him in the pious de&s;ign of &s;erving the poor, and got them ap|proved by Pope Gregory XIII. Afterwards &s;ome other ho&s;pitals were built in imitation of this, the number of which increa&s;ing, they united, and formed a congregation, under the name of, The Charity of St. Hippolytus; which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chazinzarians,</HI> a &s;ect of heretics which aro&s;e in Armenia, in the &s;eventh century. They are &s;o called from the Armenian word <HI>chazus,</HI> which &s;ignifies a cro&s;s, becau&s;e they are charged with adoring the cro&s;s; whence, in Greek, they are likewi&s;e called <HI>&s;taurolatrae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Childermas Day,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Innecents Day,</HI> an anniver&s;ary fea&s;t of the church, held on the 28th of December, in memory of the children of Bethlehem, ma&s;&s;acred by order of Herod.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chorepi&s;copi.</HI> In the ancient church, when the dioce&s;es became en|larged by the conver&s;ion of Pagans in the country, and villages at a great di&s;tance from the city-church, the Bi&s;hops appointed them&s;elves certain a&s;&s;i&s;tants, whom they called <HI>Chorepi&s;copi,</HI> be|cau&s;e by their office they were Bi&s;hops of the country. There have been great di&s;putes among the learned concerning the na|ture of this order. Among the &s;choolmen and canoni&s;ts, it is a received opinion, that they were mere Pre&s;byters. Others think there were two &s;orts of Chorepi&s;copi; &s;ome that had Epi&s;copal ordination, and others that were mere Pre&s;byters. But a third, and the mo&s;t probable opinion, is, that they were all Bi&s;hops. This is the &s;entiment of Bi&s;hop Barlow, Dr. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmond, Dr. Beveridge, and Dr. Cave. See <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;m,</HI> oil con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crated by the Bi&s;hop, and u&s;ed in the Romi&s;h and Greek churches, in the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m, confirmation, ordination, and extreme unction. The chri&s;m is prepared on Holy Thur&s;day with a world of ceremony. In Spain it was an|ciently the cu&s;tom for the Bi&s;hop to take one-third of a &s;ol for the chri&s;m di&s;tributed to each church on account of the bal&s;am that entered its compo&s;ition. Du Cange ob&s;erves, there are two kinds of chri&s;m; the one prepared of oil and bal&s;am, u&s;ed in bapti&s;m,
<PB REF="396">confirmation, and ordination; the other of oil alone, con&s;ecrated by the Bi&s;hop, u&s;ed anciently for the catechumens, and &s;till in extreme unction. The Maronites, before their reconcilement with Rome, be&s;ides oil and bal&s;am, u&s;ed mu&s;k, &s;affron, cinnamon, ro&s;es, white frankincen&s;e, and &s;everal other drugs mentioned by Rynaldus, in 1541, with the do&s;es of each. The Je&s;uit Dandini, who went to Mount Libanus in quality of the Pope's Nuncio, or|dained, in a &s;ynod held there in 1596, that chri&s;m for the future &s;hould be made only of two ingredients, oil and bal&s;am; the one repre&s;enting the human nature of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the other his di|vine nature. The action of impo&s;ing the chri&s;m is called <HI>chri&s;|mation.</HI> This the generality of the Romi&s;h divines hold to be the next matter of the &s;acrament of confirmation. The chri&s;mation in bapti&s;m is performed by the prie&s;t; that in confirmation by the Bi&s;hop; that in ordination, &amp;c. is more u&s;ually &s;tiled <HI>unction.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> an appellation u&s;ually added to Je&s;us, and, together there|with, denominates the Me&s;&s;iah, or Saviour of the world. The word in the original Greek &s;ignifies anointed. Sometimes the word Chri&s;t is u&s;ed &s;ingly, by way of antonoma&s;is, to denote a per&s;on &s;ent from God, an anointed prophet, or prie&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> one who profe&s;&s;es the Chri&s;tian religion, or one who be|lieves in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and is bapti&s;ed in his name.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> a name fir&s;t given at Antioch to the followers of Chri&s;t. They were &s;ometimes called brethren, faithful, &s;aints, believers, friends, &amp;c. The names of Nazarenes and Gallileans were like|wi&s;e given them by the Gentiles. It is the opinion of &s;ome, that Chri&s;tian was derived originally from the Greek word <HI>chri&s;tos,</HI> good, u&s;eful, &amp;c. and applied to their Kings, as denoting au|thority or &s;acred. Hence the King of France bears the title or &s;irname of The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, <HI>Rex Chri&s;tiani&s;&s;imus.</HI> The French antiquaries trace the original of the appellation up to Gre|gory the Great; who writing a letter to Charles Martel, occa|&s;ionally gave him that title, which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have &s;ince re|tained. The Chri&s;tians were &s;ometimes &s;tiled Gno&s;tics, <HI>i. e.</HI> men of under&s;tanding and knowledge; a name which was aped and abu&s;ed by a perver&s;e &s;ort of heretics, who are commonly di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of Gno&s;tics, becau&s;e of their pretences to knowledge and &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called. Another name, which frequently occurs in the writings of the ancients, is that of The|ophori, which &s;ignifies temples of God, and is as old as Ignatius. We &s;ometimes al&s;o meet with the name Chri&s;tophori, u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; yet it is very ob&s;ervable, that in all the names they cho&s;e there were &s;ome peculiar relation to Chri&s;t or God; for party-names, and human appellations, they ever profe&s;&s;ed to ab|hor. Eu&s;ebius records a &s;tory of one Sactus, a deacon of the church of Vienna, who &s;uffered in the per&s;ecution under Anto|ninus. Being put to the rack, and examined by the magi&s;trate con|cerning
<PB REF="397">his name, his country, his city, and his quality, his an|&s;wer to all the&s;e que&s;tions was, "I am a Chri&s;tian." This, he &s;aid, was to him both name, and city, and kindred; nor could his per&s;ecutors extort any other an&s;wer from him. The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the mo&s;t remarkable manner by their conduct and their virtues. The faithful, whom the preaching of St. Peter had converted, hearkened attentively to the exhortations of the Apo&s;tles, who &s;ailed not carefully to in&s;truct them, as per&s;ons who were entering upon an entirely new life: they went every day to the temple with one heart and one mind, and continued in prayers, doing nothing different from the other Jews, becau&s;e it was not yet time to &s;eparate them. But they made a &s;till greater progre&s;s in virtue; for they &s;old all that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and di&s;tributed their goods in proportion to the wants of their brethren. They eat their meat with gladne&s;s and &s;ingle|ne&s;s of heart, prai&s;ing God, and having favour with all the peo|ple. St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, examining from what &s;ource the eminent virtue of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians &s;lowed, a&s;cribes it principally to their dive&s;ting them&s;elves of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: for (&s;ays that Father) per&s;ons from whom all that they have is taken away, are not &s;ub|ject unto &s;in; whereas, whoever has large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, wants not a devil or a tempter to draw him into hell a thou&s;and ways.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;tians of St. John,</HI> a very ancient, but corrupt &s;et of Chri&s;tians, very numerous in Ba&s;&s;ora, and the neighbouring towns. They inhabited along the river Jordan, where St. John bapti&s;ed, and from him they had their name. They hold an anniver&s;ary fea&s;t five days, during which they all go to their Bi&s;hop, and are bapti&s;ed. They have no canonical books, and deny the third per&s;on in the Trinity.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;tians of St. Thomas,</HI> or San Thoma, a &s;ect of ancient Chri&s;|tians, found in the Ea&s;t Indies, when the Europeans touched at the port of Callicut, who pretend to be de&s;cended from tho&s;e St. Tho|mas converted in the Indies; whence the name: the natives call them, by way of contempt, Nazarenes; their more honourable appellation is <HI>Mappuleymer.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> (g. d. <HI>Chri&s;ti mi&s;&s;a,</HI> i. e. the ma&s;s of Chri&s;t) a fe&s;tival celebrated on the 25th day of December, in commemoration of the birth of Chri&s;t, by the particular &s;ervice of the church.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Church,</HI> is a religious a&s;&s;embly, or the large fair building where they meet; &s;ometimes means a &s;ynod of Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;byters, and in &s;ome places the Pope and a general council. Bellarmine, and the Romi&s;h divines, to this definition add, under the &s;ame Pope, &s;overeign Pontiff, and Vicar of Je&s;us Chri&s;t on earth; in which circum&s;tance it is that the Romi&s;h and reformed notion of church differ. Amelotte and others make a vi&s;ible head, or chief, e&s;|&s;ential to a church. Accordingly, among the Catholics the Pope, in England the King, are re&s;pectively allowed heads of the church. Bi&s;hop Hoadley &s;ets a&s;ide the notion of a vi&s;ible head:
<PB REF="398">Chri&s;t alone, according to him, is head of the church; which po&s;ition he has maintained with great addre&s;s, in a celebrated &s;er|mon before King George I. on the&s;e words, <HI>My kingdom is not of this world;</HI> and in the &s;everal vindications thereof. Sometimes we con&s;ider church in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, and divide it into &s;eve|ral branches. The church militant is the a&s;&s;embly of the faithful on earth; church triumphant, that of the faithful already in glo|ry; to which the Catholics add the church patient, that of the faithful in Purgatory. <HI>Eccle&s;ia,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ynonymous with our church, is u&s;ed in the Greek and Latin prophane authors for any kind of public a&s;&s;embly; and even for the place where the a&s;&s;em|bly is held. The &s;acred and eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers &s;ometimes al&s;o u&s;e it in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; but ordinarily re&s;train the term to the Chri&s;|tians; as the term &s;ynagogue, which originally &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing, is in like manner re&s;trained to the Jews. Thus, in the New Te&s;tament, the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies almo&s;t always ei|ther the place de&s;tined for prayer, as 1 Cor. xiv. 34, or the a&s;|&s;embly of the faithful diffu&s;ed over the whole earth, as Ephe&s;. v. 24. or the faithful of a particular city or province, as 2 Cor. viii. 1, 2. or even of a &s;ingle family, as Rom. xvi. 1. or the pa&s;tors or mini&s;ters of a church, as Matt. xvii. 17.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Collect,</HI> in the liturgy of the church of England, and the ma&s;s of the Romani&s;ts, denotes a prayer accommodated for any particular day, occa&s;ion, or the like. In general, all the prayers in each office are called collects; either becau&s;e the prie&s;t &s;peaks in the name of the whole a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e &s;entiments and de&s;ires he &s;ums up by the word <HI>oremus, let us pray,</HI> as is ob&s;erved by Pope Innocent III. or becau&s;e tho&s;e prayers are offered when the peo|ple are a&s;&s;embled together; which is the opinion of Pamelius on Tertullian. The congregation it&s;elf is in &s;ome ancient authors called collect: the Popes Gela&s;ius and Gregory are &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;hed collects.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Colluthians,</HI> a Chri&s;tian &s;ect, who ro&s;e about the beginning of the fourth century, on occa&s;ion of the indulgence &s;hewn to Arius by Alexander, patriarch of Alexandria. Several people being &s;can|dalized at &s;o much conde&s;cen&s;ion, and, among the re&s;t, Collu|thus, a prie&s;t of the &s;ame city, he hence took a pretence for holding &s;eparate a&s;&s;emblies, and by degrees proceeded to the or|dinaton of prie&s;ts, as if he had been a Bi&s;hop, pretending a ne|ce&s;&s;ity for this authority, in order to oppo&s;e Arius. To this &s;chi&s;m he added here&s;y, teaching that God did not create the wicked, and that he was not author of the evils that befal men. He was condemned in a council held at Alexandria by O&s;ius, in the year 335.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Collyridians,</HI> Arabian heretics in the fourth century, &s;o denominated from idolizing the Virgin Mary, wor&s;hipping her as a godde&s;s, and offering to her cakes. St. Epiphanius wrote again&s;t this extrava|gant &s;uper&s;tition, and &s;hewed them how to di&s;tingui&s;h between
<PB REF="399">the honour which ought to be paid to the virgin, and that wor|&s;hip which is due only to God.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Collobium,</HI> a garment worn by Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters in the primi|tive ages. It was a &s;hort coat with &s;hort &s;leeves. It was an u&s;ual garment among the Romans; and therefore a Bi&s;hop, or Pre&s;byter, wearing a collobium, is no proof that the clergy in tho&s;e early times were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their habit from the laity, as &s;ome have thought, but is rather a proof of the contrary.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Commendam,</HI> in the canon or eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, is the charge, tru&s;t, or admini&s;tration of a benefice, given either to a layman to hold by way of depo&s;itum, for &s;ix months, in order for repairs, &amp;c. or to another eccle&s;ia&s;tic, or beneficed per&s;on, to perform the pa&s;toral duties thereof, till &s;uch time as the benefice is provided of a re|gular incumbent. Anciently commendams were a very laudable in&s;titution; for when an elective benefice became vacant, for which the ordinary could not for &s;ome rea&s;on immediately provide, the care of it was recommended to &s;ome man of merit, who took upon him the direction of it till the vacancy was filled up, but who enjoyed none of the profits. Commendam, in the church of Rome, is likewi&s;e a real title of a regular benefice, &s;uch as an abbey or priory given by the Pope to a &s;ecular clerk, or even to a layman, with power to di&s;po&s;e of the fruits thereof during life: and, by the Pope's bulls, the commendatory abbot has the full authority of the regular abbot, to whom he is &s;ub&s;tituted, except ing only in <HI>&s;piritualibus,</HI> the direction of which is left to the clau|&s;tral prior. Benefices in commendam are ve&s;ted in the crown by a &s;tatute of Henry VIII. This right was conte&s;ted in the reign of King James I. who de&s;igning to give in commendam a vacant church, it was di&s;puted in the court of Common Pleas, not only whether the King might grant a commendam to a Bi&s;hop, either before or after his con&s;ecration; but al&s;o whether commendams were to be granted without nece&s;&s;ity. The point was &s;olemnly argued by the judges, who were &s;everely reprimanded at the council-board by the King, for daring to attack the prerogative royal.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Communion,</HI> the being united in doctrine and di&s;cipline. In this &s;en&s;e of the word different churches are &s;aid to hold communion with each other; and in the primitive Chri&s;tian church every Bi&s;hop was obliged, after his ordination, to &s;end circular letters to foreign or remote churches, who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame faith, to &s;ignify that he was in communion with them. To maintain this unity of the faith entire, every church was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t all others in commu|nion with her, by oppo&s;ing all fundamental errors and here&s;ies; and this gave occa&s;ion to mo&s;t of the provincial and national &s;ynods we read of, in which novel, and what they thought erroneous doctrines, were condemned by a council of Bi&s;hops. This unity was al&s;o further maintained by the readine&s;s of each church, and every member of it, to join with all other churches in the perfor|mance
<PB REF="400">of doctrine, wor&s;hip, and all holy offices, as occa&s;ion re|quired, by a mutual con&s;ent in ratifying all legal acts of di&s;cipline regularly exerci&s;ed in any church what&s;oever, by unanimou&s;ly re|ceiving the cu&s;toms of the church of Rome, and adhering to the decrees of councils, both general and national. All the Chri&s;tian churches were originally in communion with each other, having one common faith and di&s;cipline; in proce&s;s of time a diver&s;ity of opinions prevailed, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome churches to &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and to form the di&s;tinct communions into which the Chri&s;tian church is at pre&s;ent divided. The three grand commu|nions are that of the church of Rome, that of the Greek church, and that of the Prote&s;tant churches.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Conception, immaculate,</HI> the &s;ubject of di&s;pute between the Dominicans and Franci&s;cans, 1387, and denied by the former. The council of Ba&s;il approved and recommended it to be embraced by all Catho|lics. The council of Trent declined pa&s;&s;ing judgment on this matter. Paul V. urged the belief of it, 1617; al&s;o Gregory XV. and Alexander VII.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Conclave,</HI> the place in which the Cardinals of the Romi&s;h church meet, and are &s;hut up, in order to the election of a Pope. The eccle|&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions allow the Cardinals to chu&s;e the place of the conclave: notwith&s;tanding which, it is always held in the Vatican, on account of the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the building, the convenience of its open &s;quare, and its galleries, which will hold a number of &s;ervants. The conclave is a range of &s;mall cells, ten feet &s;quare, made of wain&s;cot; they are numbered, and drawn for by lot; they &s;tand in a line along the galleries, and half the Vatican, with a &s;mall &s;pace between each. Such Cardinals as were created by the late Pope hang their cells with violet-coloured &s;tuff, and the re&s;t with green &s;erge: each cell has the arms of the re&s;pective Cardinal. Strong guard is kept at the door of the Vatican, and round the conclave, and many precautions, with much ceremony, made u&s;e of, to prevent any intelligence being conveyed, or in|tere&s;t, or bribery, &amp;c. but, notwith&s;tanding that, great artifice is made u&s;e of to effect an election, and it is generally obtained by corruption.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Conferences,</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical, by order or with the con&s;ent of public autho|rity, were, 1&s;t, That of the di&s;&s;enting brethren for de&s;troying greater harmony of &s;entiments and unity or friend&s;hip among&s;t differing &s;ocieties or members at Marpuge, particularly on the euchari&s;t, 1526. 2dly, At Spire, where the name of Prote&s;tants was fir&s;t u&s;ed, in 1529. 3dly, At Smalcalde, a city in Franconia, in Ger|many, where were pre&s;ent 15 Princes, be&s;ides the deputies of 30 cities which had embraced the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion, and renewed for ten years the league which the other Prote&s;tants had made for their own defence, at which the amba&s;&s;adors from England and France gave attendance, and pur&s;uant to in&s;tructions confirmed that league in 1535. This was held by adjourment in the year 1537,
<PB REF="401">by the Prote&s;tant Princes and deputies of the Lutheran cities, who agreed vigorou&s;ly to &s;upport them&s;elves again&s;t any infringement of their Chri&s;tian liberty, and eventually, after &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions, obtained an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant religion in Germany, the progre&s;&s;ive &s;teps to which are largely &s;et forth by Hoffman, 1540. 4thly, Held at the &s;ame place, when the Emperor Charles V. endeavoured to obtrude &s;ome articles of farther concilia|tion with the Prote&s;tants, which they rejected, 1548. 5thly, At Alten&s;burg, among the Lutherans, on the point of ju&s;tifica|tion, 1569; and at a &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion, held by the &s;ame members at Quintenburgh, on the ubiquity of God, 1573. 6thly, At Torgo, concerning divers articles of faith, 1576. Another &s;e&s;&s;ion held at Bipent, and another at Hetzburg, for compiling a book of Concord, 1578.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Confirmation,</HI> or impo&s;ition of hands, is a rite of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, which in the primitive church u&s;ed to be admini&s;tered, or made u&s;e of immediately after bapti&s;m, if the Bi&s;hop was pre&s;ent at the &s;olemnity. It was made a &s;acrament of the church of Rome in the Mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ian council. This rite was re&s;erved to Bi&s;hops, by Theodoris, 526. By the church of Rome the &s;acrament of confir|mation is that which makes us perfect Chri&s;tians, and impre&s;&s;es an indelible character upon us after bapti&s;m, and imparts to us the &s;pirit of fortitude, whereby we are enabled to confe&s;s Chri&s;tianity even at the hazard of our lives. Not &s;o the Prote&s;tants, for confir|mation with them is no &s;acrament, no federal rites are declared to belong to it; it is no new &s;tipulation, but rather a ratification of our bapti&s;mal engagements.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Congregation,</HI> an a&s;&s;embly of &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics, united &s;o as to con|&s;titute a body. The term is principally u&s;ed for a&s;&s;emblies of Cardinals, appointed by the Pope, and di&s;tributed into &s;everal chambers, for the di&s;charge of certain functions and juri&s;dictions, after the manner of our offices and courts.&mdash;The fir&s;t is the con|gregation of the holy office, or the inqui&s;ition; the &s;econd, that of juri&s;diction over Bi&s;hops and regulars; the third, that of councils with power to interpret the council of Trent; the fourth, that of cu&s;toms, ceremonies, precedencies, canonizations, called the congregation of rites; the fifth, that of St. Peter's fabric, which takes cognizance of all cau&s;es relating to piety and charity, part whereof is due to the church of St. Peter; the &s;ixth, that of waters, rivers, roads; the &s;eventh, that of fountains and &s;treets; the eighth, that of the index, which examines the books to be printed or corrected; the ninth, that of the government of the whole &s;tate of the church; the tenth, <HI>De bono regimine,</HI> of which the Cardinal's nephew is chief; the eleventh, that of money; the twelfth, that of Bi&s;hops, wherein tho&s;e who are to be promoted to bi&s;hoprics in Italy are examined, this is held before the Pope; the thirteenth, that of con&s;i&s;torial matters, the chief whereof is Cardinal Dean.
<PB REF="402">There is al&s;o a congregation of alms, which takes care of what relates to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of Rome and the &s;tate of the church.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Con&s;i&s;tory,</HI> or Roman Con&s;i&s;tory, denotes the college of Cardinals, or the Pope's &s;enate and council, before whom judiciary cau&s;es are pleaded. Du Cange derives the word from <HI>con&s;i&s;torium,</HI> i. e. <HI>locus ubi con&s;i&s;titur;</HI> u&s;ed chiefly for a ve&s;tible, gallery, or ante|chamber, where the courtiers wait for admi&s;&s;ion, and called <HI>a con&s;i&s;tente multitudine.</HI> The con&s;i&s;tory is the fir&s;t court or tribunal of Rome; it never meets but when the Pope plea&s;es to convoke it, and the Pope pre&s;ides in it in per&s;on, mounted on a magnificent throne, and habited in his pontificalia: on the right are Cardinal bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts, and on the left Cardinal deacons. The place where it is held, is a large hall, in the apo&s;tolical palace, where Princes and amba&s;&s;adors of Kings are received. The other pre|lates, prothonatories, auditors of rota, and other officers, are &s;eated on the &s;teps of the throne; the courtiers &s;it on the ground, am|ba&s;&s;adors on the right, and con&s;i&s;torial and fi&s;cal advocates be|hind the Cardinals. Be&s;ides the public con&s;i&s;tory, there is al&s;o a private one held in a retired chamber, called the chamber of Pa|pegay, the Pope's throne here being only rai&s;ed two &s;teps high. No body is here admitted, but the Cardinals, who&s;e opinions are collected, and called &s;entences. Here are fir&s;t propo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed all bulls for bi&s;hoprics, abbeys, &amp;c. Hence bi&s;hoprics and abbeys are &s;aid to be con&s;i&s;torial benefices, in regard they mu&s;t be pro|po&s;ed to their con&s;i&s;tory, the annates be paid to the Pope, and his bulls taken. Anciently they were elective, but by the con|cordat, which aboli&s;hes elections, they are appointed to be col|lated by the Pope alone, on the nomination of the Prince. Con|&s;i&s;tory was always the name of a court under Con&s;tantine, where he &s;at in per&s;on, and heard cau&s;es. The members of this court were called <HI>Con&s;ites.</HI> Con&s;i&s;tory is al&s;o u&s;ed among the reformed, for a council or a&s;&s;embly of mini&s;ters or elders, to regulate their affairs, di&s;cipline, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> an e&s;tabli&s;hment, ordinance, deci&s;ion, regulation, or law, made by authority of a Prince, or other &s;uperior, eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil. The con&s;titutions of the Roman Emperors make a part of the civil law; the con&s;titutions of the church make a part of the canon law. Some of the papal con&s;titutions are in form of bulls, others of briefs. Apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions denote a collection of regula|tions, attributed to the Apo&s;tles, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been col|lected by St. Clement, who&s;e name they likewi&s;e bear. They are divided into eight books, con&s;i&s;ting of a great number of rules and precepts relating to the duties of Chri&s;tians, and particularly to the ceremonies and di&s;cipline of the church. Authors are di|vided about their genuinene&s;s: the generality hold them &s;purious, and endeavour to prove them po&s;terior to the apo&s;tolical age, main|taining they were unknown till the fourth century; which, if &s;o, &s;hews St. Clement had no hand in them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="403"><HI>Convocation,</HI> a general a&s;&s;embly of the clergy of a province, &s;ummon|ed by the King's writ, to con&s;ult of the more weighty affairs of the church, as oft as a parliament is convoked to con&s;ult tho&s;e of the &s;tate. The King's writ is directed to the Archbi&s;hop of each pro|vince, requiring him to &s;ummon all Bi&s;hops, Deans, Archdeacons, of cathedral, collegiate churches, &amp;c. The place where the convo|cation of the province of Canterbury have been u&s;ually held, is St. Paul's church, whence of late they have been prorogued to St. Peter's in We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the chapel of Henry VII. or the Jeru|&s;alem chamber, where there is an upper and lower hou&s;e. The power of the convocation is limited by a &s;tatute of King Henry VIII. They are not to make any canons, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, without the King's licence; nor, when permitted to make any, can they put them in execution, but under the&s;e re&s;trictions. 1. Such canons mu&s;t not be contrary to the King's prerogative. 2. They mu&s;t not contradict any &s;tatute, or the common law. 3. Nor mu&s;t they alter any known cu&s;tom of the realm. They have the examining and cen&s;uring all heretical and &s;chi&s;matical books and per&s;ons, &amp;c. but there lies an appeal to the King in Chancery, or to his delegates. The clergy in convocation, and their &s;er|vants, have the &s;ame privileges as members of parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cope,</HI> an eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit. By an act of King Edward VI. when&s;oever the Bi&s;hop &s;hall celebrate the holy communion in the church, he &s;hall have upon him, be&s;ides his rochet, a &s;urplice or albe, and a cope, &amp;c. It an&s;wers to the collobium or epi&s;copal habit of the ancient church, and was at fir&s;t a common habit, being a coat without &s;leeves; but was afterwards u&s;ed as a church|ve&s;tment, only made very rich by embroidery, and the like. The Greeks pretend it was fir&s;t u&s;ed in memory of the mock robe put upon our Saviour.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Copiotae,</HI> a particular order of men, in the primitive Chri&s;tian church, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to inter the dead. They were &s;o called, either from the pains they took, or el&s;e becau&s;e they committed the bodies of the dead to the grave, a place of ea&s;e and re&s;t. They were in&s;tituted in the time of Con&s;tantine, or his &s;on Con&s;tantius, in two of who&s;e laws they are expre&s;sly mentioned. Their particular office was to prepare the graves, wrap up the bodies of the dead, and then bury them; and becau&s;e this was ever accounted a work of piety and religion, therefore the Copiotae, though not in holy orders, were con&s;idered as bearing a relation to the clergy, and ve&s;ted with the &s;ame immunities. Their number was very great: Con&s;tan|tine is &s;aid to have appointed no le&s;s than eleven hundred; but, by a law of Honorius and Theodo&s;ius, they were reduced to nine hundred and fifty, though Ana&s;ta&s;ius afterwards brought them back to the fir&s;t number.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Corporal,</HI> in the Chri&s;tian church. It is a fair linen cloth thrown over the con&s;ecrated elements, at the celebration of the euchari&s;t. It was &s;o called by the Latins, from being &s;pread over the body of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and, according to I&s;idore Pelu&s;iola, was
<PB REF="404">de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the body of our Saviour, being wrapt in fine linen by Jo&s;eph of Arimathea. The in&s;titution of it is a&s;cribed to Eu&s;ebius, Bi&s;hop of Rome, about the year 300.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Covenant.</HI> The fir&s;t covenant between God and man was that which he made with Adam at his creation, when he required him to forbear the u&s;e of the forbidden fruit. The &s;econd covenant is that which God made with man after his fall, by promi&s;ing him not only forgivene&s;s, provided he repented, but al&s;o the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, who &s;hould redeem him, and all the human race, from death. A third covenant is that which God made with Noah, when he directed him to build an ark. A fourth covenant is that which God made with Abraham, the mark and &s;eal of which was circumci&s;ion. But the greate&s;t, mo&s;t &s;olemn, mo&s;t excellent, and mo&s;t perfect, which God ever made with man, is that which he enter|ed into with us through the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that eternal covenant, which mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t to the end of ages: the prie&s;thood, &s;acrifice, and laws, are infinitely more exalted than tho&s;e of the Old Te&s;tament.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Coul,</HI> or <HI>Cowl,</HI> a &s;ort of monki&s;h habit worn by the Barnardines and Benedictines. There are two kinds of couls, the one white, very large, wore in ceremony, and when they a&s;&s;i&s;t at the office: the other black, wore on ordinary occa&s;ions, in the &s;treets, &amp;c. F.

<ITEM><HI>Council,</HI> primitive and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, is a free, public, eccle&s;ia&s;tical meeting, e&s;pecially of Bi&s;hops, and al&s;o of other Doctors lawfully deputed by divers churches, for the examining of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, according to the &s;criptures, and tho&s;e according to the power given by common &s;uffrage, without favour of parties, to be determined, in matters of faith, by canons. In ca&s;es of practice, by precedents in di&s;cipline, by decrees and con&s;titutions. The&s;e are not called for deciding political controver&s;ies; this properly belonging to diets, parliaments, &amp;c.

<ITEM><P><HI>Councils,</HI> OEcumenical or General, are a&s;&s;emblies of all the prelates in Chri&s;tendom, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of it.

They made 102 canons, many of them trifling in their nature, others very &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive to &s;uch as differed in point of faith or di&s;cipline.

It con&s;i&s;ted of 630 bi&s;hops, who condemned the &s;uper|&s;titious acts of the council of Ephe&s;us: they affirmed one only na|ture to be in Chri&s;t, after his incarnation, viz. his divine nature; and decreed 29 canons, many of which are not approved by the Papi&s;ts, viz. in one of the canons, that all bi&s;hops are equal with re&s;pect to power or privileges.&mdash;The eighth general coun|cil was held at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in 869, began on the 5th of Oc|tober, and ended the la&s;t day of February the next year, a|gain&s;t Photius and his adherents.&mdash;The ninth general council, and the fir&s;t of Lateran, was held in March, A.

The&s;e modern repre|&s;entations of the cro&s;s are called <HI>crucifixes.</HI> Before the refor|mation it was e&s;teemed a piece of devotion to erect cro&s;&s;es on hills, in church-yards, or over the tombs of great per&s;onages, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cro&s;s, exaltation of.</HI> A fe&s;tival of the Greek and Romi&s;h churches, ob&s;erved on the 14th of December. In the reign of Heraclius, Co&s;roes, King of Per&s;ia, &s;acked Jeru&s;alem; and together with other plunder, carried off that part of the cro&s;s left there, in memory of our Saviour, by the Empre&s;s Helena, which he &s;ent into Per&s;ia. After many battles, in which the Per&s;ians were al|ways defeated, Heraclius had the good fortune to recover the cro&s;s. This Prince carried it to Jeru&s;alem him&s;elf, and laying a&s;ide his Imperial ornaments, marched with it on his &s;houlders to the top of Mount Calvary, from whence it had been taken. The memory of this action was perpetuated by the fe&s;tivals of the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment (or, as it is now called) the exaltation of the cro&s;s. The latter name was given to this fe&s;tival, becau&s;e, on this day, they exalted, or &s;et up, the cro&s;s in the great church at Con&s;tantinople, in order to &s;hew it to the people. This fe&s;tival is di&s;tingui&s;hed among the Coptic or Egyptian Chri&s;ti|ans, by the benediction of a particular cro&s;s, which is afterwards thrown into the river Nile, in order to make its waters fall away, or rather as a grateful acknowledgment of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings which attend its overflowing.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cru&s;ade,</HI> in Spani&s;h, La Cruciata, a &s;ociety or body of men, from whom the court of inqui&s;ition, in Spain, receives no &s;mall &s;ervice. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to have an eye over the behaviour of all Roman Catholics, and to inform again&s;t them, in ca&s;e they omit any duties of the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. This &s;ociety is va&s;tly rich, and as powerful as it is wealthy; for it con&s;i&s;ts of the bi&s;hops, archbi|&s;hops, and mo&s;t of the grandees of Spain. The Spaniards are per&s;uaded, that, had it not been for the inqui&s;ition and cru&s;ade, their kingdom would have been over-run by the heretics, who had near po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the other kingdoms and &s;tates of Eu|rope.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cup.</HI> This word is often taken in &s;cripture both in a proper and a figu|rative &s;en&s;e; in the proper &s;en&s;e, it &s;ignifies a common cup, which people drink out of at their meals; or a cup of ceremony, made u&s;e of at &s;olemn and religious fe&s;tivals, as at the pa&s;&s;over, or &s;ome other hereditary bowls, made u&s;e of in friendly entertainments &mdash; In the figurative &s;en&s;e is it generally taken for the afflictions which God &s;ends; to drink of the cup, &s;ignifies to endure tho&s;e puni&s;h|ments which God has &s;een and thought fit to exerci&s;e one under.&mdash; The cup of ble&s;&s;ing, is that which was ble&s;&s;ed in entertainments of ceremony; thus our Saviour, in the la&s;t &s;upper, ble&s;&s;ed the cup, and gave it to all his apo&s;tles to drink.&mdash;The cup of &s;alvation, men|tioned
<PB REF="412">in the P&s;alms is a cup of thank&s;giving, which, while people drank, they ble&s;&s;ed the Lord, and were thankful for his mercies. The Jews have &s;till at this day cups of thank&s;giving, which are ble&s;&s;ed in their marriage-ceremonies, and in entertainments made at the circumci&s;ion of their children.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>DAlmatica,</HI> a ve&s;tment, or habit of a Bi&s;hop and deacon, &s;o called, becau&s;e it was fir&s;t invented in Dalmatia. Pope Sylve&s;ter ap|pointed it to be u&s;ed by the deacons. It was a royal garment, having been worn by the Emperor Pertinax, and it was called Chirodota, or Manicata, becau&s;e it had &s;leeves, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the col|lobium, which had none. The Dalmatica was all of white before, but behind had two purple lines or &s;tripes. Pope Eutychianus de|creed, that the bodies of the martyrs &s;hould be wrapped up in the dalmatica. Virgins are &s;ometimes repre&s;ented in this dre&s;s, for there is at Rome a picture of St. Caecilia, in the church of that Saint, habited in the Dalmatica. See <HI>Collobium.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Damiani&s;ts,</HI> &s;o called from Damianus, a Bi&s;hop, a branch of the ancient Acephalous Severites; who, with the Catholics, admitted the fourth council, but di&s;owned any di&s;tinction of per&s;ons in the Godhead, and prefe&s;&s;ed one &s;ingle nature incapable of any diffe|rence.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Datary,</HI> an officer in the Pope's court. He is always a Prelate, and &s;ometimes a Cardinal, deputed by his Holine&s;s to receive &s;uch petitions as are pre&s;ented to him, touching the provi&s;ion of benefices. The Datary has power to grant, without acquainting his Holine&s;s therewith, all &s;uch benefices as do not exceed twenty-four ducats annually; but for &s;uch as amount to more, he is obliged to get the provi&s;ions &s;igned by the Pope, who admits him to audience every day. If there be &s;everal candidates for the &s;ame place, he has the liberty of be&s;towing it on which of them he thinks proper, provided he has the requi&s;ite qualifications. This officer has likewi&s;e a &s;ub&s;titute; but he can confer no benefice at all. When a per&s;on has obtained the Pope's con&s;ent for a bene|fice, the Datary &s;ub&s;cribes his petition, <HI>annuit &s;ancti&s;&s;imus,</HI> i. e. The mo&s;t holy father con&s;ents to it. After the petition has pa&s;&s;ed the proper offices and is regi&s;tered, it is carried to the Datary, who dates it, and writes the&s;e words, <HI>datum Romae apud,</HI> &amp;c. given at Rome in the Pontifical palace, &amp;c. Afterwards the Pope's bull, granting the benefice, is di&s;patched by the Datary, and pa&s;&s;es thro' the hands of more than 1000 per&s;ons, belonging to fifteen diffe|rent offices, who have all their &s;tated fees. The reader may gue&s;s at the revenue of the Datary, e&s;pecially when the Pope's bull is procured for &s;ome large benefices.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Davidi&s;ts,</HI> Davidici, a &s;ect of heretics, the adherents of David George, a glazier, or, as others &s;ay, painter, of Ghent; who, in 1525, began to preach a new doctrine, publi&s;hing him&s;elf to be
<PB REF="413">the true Me&s;&s;iah, and that he was &s;ent thither to fill heaven which was quite empty, for want of people to de&s;erve it. He re|jected marriage, &amp;c. and laughed at the &s;elf-denial &s;o much re|commended by Chri&s;t. He died in 1556; but having promi&s;ed his di&s;ciples to ri&s;e again, at the end of three years, the magi&s;trates of Ba&s;il, where he died, ordered his body to be dug up and burnt, together with his writings, by the common hangman.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Day, Lammas,</HI> the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, celebrated as a fe&s;tival, in the Romi&s;h church, in memory of St. Peter's impri&s;onment. Eudocia, the wife of Theodo&s;ius the Emperor, having made a journey to Jeru&s;alem, was there pre&s;ented with the fetters which St. Peter was loaded with in pri&s;on. The&s;e &s;he pre&s;ented to the Pope, who afterwards laid them up in a church, built by Theodo&s;ius, in honour of St. Peter. Eudocia, in the mean time, having ob&s;erved that the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t was celebrated in memory of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, who had on that day been &s;aluted Augu&s;tus, and upon that account given occa&s;ion to the changing the name of the month, from Sextilis to Augu&s;t, that Prince&s;s thought it not rea&s;onable that a holyday &s;hould be kept in memory of an Heathen Emperor, and therefore obtained a decree of Theodo&s;ius, that this day &s;hould for the future be kept holy, in remembrance of St. Peter's bonds. This fe&s;tival is known, in the Roman calendar, by the name of the fea&s;t of St. Peter <HI>(in vinculis)</HI> in fetters. It was called among us Lammas Day, from a fond conceit the Popi&s;h people had, that St. Peter was patron of the lambs, becau&s;e our Saviour &s;aid to him, <HI>feed my lambs;</HI> upon which account they thought the ma&s;s of this day very beneficial to make their lambs thrive.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Deacon,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>mini&s;ter, &s;ervant.</HI> This word is made u&s;e of in the language of the church, to denote tho&s;e who&s;e office it is to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Bi&s;hop, or prie&s;t, in the di&s;tribution of the euchari&s;t, and, be|&s;ides this, in the &s;ervice of the poor, and admini&s;tring what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them. The number of the di&s;ciples increa&s;ing daily at Jeru&s;alem, the Greeks, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Gentile converts, began to mur|mur again&s;t the Hebrews, and to complain that their widows were neglected in the di&s;tribution of alms, which was made every day; hereupon the Apo&s;tles called the multitude of believers together, and &s;aid, "It is not rea&s;onable that we &s;hould leave the word of God, wherefore look you out among you &s;even men of hone&s;t re|port, full of the Holy Gho&s;t and wi&s;dom, whom ye may appoint over this bu&s;ine&s;s." They therefore cho&s;e &s;even, viz. Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas; the&s;e they pre&s;ented to the Apo&s;tles, and they were ordained by prayer and impo&s;ition of hands, Acts vi. 1. 1 Tim. ii. 8&mdash;12. Tho&s;e in the Romi&s;h church &s;ometimes bapti&s;ed and preached in the ab&s;ence of their Bi&s;hop or prie&s;t, and prepared catechumens for bapti&s;m. (See particularly their office in the hi&s;tories of the church of Scotland, the Pre&s;byterians, &amp;c. &amp;c.)</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="414"><HI>Deacone&s;&s;es</HI> were allowed in the primitive church, but now laid a&s;ide. Certain devout women who con&s;ecrated them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the church, and rendered tho&s;e offices to women which men could not decently do: as in bapti&s;m, for in&s;tance, which was conferred by immer&s;ion on women as well as men.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Deaconry,</HI> a name &s;till re&s;erved to the chapels and oratories in Rome, under the direction of the &s;everal deacons in their re&s;pec|tive regions or quarters.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dean,</HI> a prime dignitary in mo&s;t cathedral and collegiate churches; being u&s;ually the pre&s;ident of the chapter. It is a title, al&s;o, ap|plied among us to divers per&s;ons that are the chief of &s;ome peculiar churches and chapels; as the Dean of the King's chapel, of the Arches, of Battel, &amp;c. &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Death.</HI> This word is taken in &s;cripture not only for the death of the body, when the &s;oul is &s;eparated from the body, but likewi&s;e for the <HI>&s;econd death,</HI> a condemnation to mi&s;ery. It al&s;o &s;ignifies im|minent danger of death; for the plague and contagious di&s;ea&s;es; for poi&s;on, and any great misfortune. By the gates of death, the grave is &s;ignified, and the &s;tate of the dead after this life. By the ve&s;&s;els or in&s;truments of death, dangerous and deadly weapons are meant. By the bonds or &s;nares of death, the &s;nares which are laid to de&s;troy an enemy. A &s;on of death, a man who merits death, or is condemned to death. By the du&s;t of death, the &s;tate to which the dead per&s;on is reduced in the grave. Love is as &s;trong as death, &s;ays Solomon; no one can re&s;i&s;t death or love.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Decalogue,</HI> the ten commandments, engraven on two tables of &s;tone, and given to Mo&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Declamation,</HI> a feigned di&s;cour&s;e, or &s;peech made in public, in the tone and manner of an oration. Among the Greeks, declama|tion was the art of &s;peaking indifferently on all &s;ubjects, and on all &s;ides of a que&s;tion, of making things appear ju&s;t that were unju&s;t, and triumphing over the be&s;t and &s;ounde&s;t rea&s;ons. Such &s;ort of declamations, M. de St. Evremond ob&s;erves, were fit only to cor|rupt the mind by accu&s;toming men to cultivate their imagination rather than to form their judgment, and to &s;eek for veri&s;imilitudes to impo&s;e upon, rather than &s;olid rea&s;ons to convince the under|&s;tanding. Among us declamation is re&s;trained to certain exerci&s;es, which &s;cholars perform to teach them to &s;peak in public.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Decree,</HI> in canon law, an ordinance which is enacted by the Pope, by and with the advice of his Cardinals, in council a&s;&s;embled, without being con&s;ulted by any per&s;on thereon.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Decree of Election and Reprobation,</HI> with &s;ome modern divines, is that council or determination of God, by which, from all eternity, he ab&s;olutely cho&s;e and &s;et apart &s;ome, in order to become good and happy; but pa&s;&s;ed by the re&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> the far greater part of mankind, forming his re&s;olves in either ca&s;e, ab&s;tractedly from all con&s;ideration of any merit or demerit of theirs; a notion
<PB REF="415">which &s;eems founded on &s;ome mi&s;con&s;trued pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and in particular tho&s;e referred to in 2 Pet. iii. 16. but of which we do not find the lea&s;t traces in antiquity, before the clo&s;e of the fourth, or beginning of the fifth century.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dedication,</HI> the act of con&s;ecrating a temple, altar, &s;tatue, place, &amp;c. to the honour of &s;ome deity. It is very ancient, both in the Heathen times, and among&s;t the Chri&s;tians. The fea&s;t of the de|dication, or rather the fea&s;t-day of the &s;aint and patron of a church, was celebrated not only by the inhabitants of the place, but by tho&s;e of all the neighbouring villages, who u&s;ually re|forted thither. The cu&s;tom is &s;till retained in divers places, un|der the names of fea&s;ts, wakes, or vigils.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Definition,</HI> an enumeration of the chief &s;imple ideas whereof a com|pound idea con&s;i&s;ts, in order to a&s;certain or explain its nature and character. The &s;choolmen give very imperfect notions of defi|nition. Some define it to be the fir&s;t notion or conception that ari&s;es of a thing, whereby it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other, and from which all the other things that we conceive of it are de|duced: but the u&s;ual definition of it is, <HI>oratio explicans quid res e&s;t,</HI> a di&s;cour&s;e explaining what a thing is, that is, as &s;ome fur|ther explain it, a di&s;cour&s;e &s;etting forth tho&s;e attributes which circum&s;cribe and determine the nature of a thing; for to explain is to propo&s;e the parts &s;eparately and expre&s;sly, which were be|fore propo&s;ed conjunctly and implicitly, &s;o that every explication has regard to &s;ome whole. Hence, according to the divers kinds of parts in any thing, <HI>viz.</HI> phy&s;ical parts, metaphy&s;ical parts, &amp;c. ari&s;e &s;o many different kinds of definitions of the &s;ame thing. Thus, man is either defined an animal, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;oul and bo|dy, or a rea&s;onable animal, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P><HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> a &s;ect or cla&s;s of people, known under the denomi|nation of Freethinkers, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing character it is, not to profe&s;s any particular form or &s;y&s;tem of religion, but only to acknowledge the exi&s;tence of a God, without rendering him any external wor&s;hip or &s;ervice. The Dei&s;ts hold, that, con&s;i|dering the multiplicity of religions, the numerous pretences to re|velation, and the precarious arguments generally advanced in proof thereof, the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way is, to return to the &s;impli|city of nature, and the belief of one God, which is the only truth agreed to by all nations. They complain, that the freedom of thinking and rea&s;oning is oppre&s;&s;ed under the yoke of religion, and that the minds of men are ridden and tyrannized by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity impo&s;ed on them of believing inconceivable my&s;teries; and contend, that nothing &s;hould be required to be a&s;&s;ented to, or believed, but what their rea&s;on clearly conceives. The appella|tion Dei&s;t is more particularly given to &s;uch as are not altogether without religion, but reject all revelation as an impo&s;ition, and believe no more than what natural light di&s;covers to them; as, that there is a God, a Providence, a future &s;tate, with rewards and
<PB REF="416">puni&s;hments for the good and the bad; that God mu&s;t be ho|noured, and his will, &s;o far as we can learn it, performed; but that each per&s;on is to do this after his own manner, and as his own con&s;cience &s;ugge&s;ts. The number of Dei&s;ts is &s;aid to be daily increa&s;ing in England: a great part of the men of &s;peculation and letters are pretended to incline that way; and the like is ob|&s;erved in &s;ome of our neighbour nations, where freedom of &s;peak|ing, writing, and thinking, are indulged.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke gives us a &s;uccinct character of &s;everal &s;orts of De|i&s;ts, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ort are tho&s;e who profe&s;s to believe the ex|i&s;tence of an eternal, infinite, independent, and intelligent Be|ing, and that this Supreme Being made the world; but they fan|cy that God does not at all concern him&s;elf in the government of the world, nor has any regard to, or concern about what is done therein: nor is the doctrine of &s;ome philo&s;ophers much different, who a&s;cribe every thing to matter and motion, and &s;peak of God as an <HI>intelligentia &s;upramundana,</HI> which is the very language of Epicurus and Lucretius.&mdash;A &s;econd &s;ort of Dei&s;ts profe&s;s to be|lieve not only the being, but al&s;o the providence of God; that is, that every <HI>natural</HI> thing that is done in the world is produced by the power, appointed by the wi&s;dom, and directed by the govern|ment of God, though, not allowing any difference between mo|ral good and evil, they &s;uppo&s;e that God takes no notice of the morally good or evil actions of men, the&s;e things depending, as they imagine, merely on the arbitrary con&s;titution of human laws. &mdash;Another &s;ort of Dei&s;ts there are, who have right apprehen&s;ions concerning the natural attributes of God, and his all-governing Providence, and &s;eem al&s;o to have &s;ome notion of his moral per|fections al&s;o: they believe him to be a being infinitely knowing, powerful, and wi&s;e, and, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a being of ju&s;tice, as of goodne&s;s and truth; that he governs the world by the&s;e perfec|tions, and expects &s;uitable obedience from all his rational crea|tures; but they are prejudiced again&s;t the immortality of human &s;ouls, and in&s;i&s;t that men peri&s;h at death entirely, and that one generation &s;hall perpetually &s;ucceed another, and that there will be no future re&s;toration or renovation of things.&mdash;A fourth &s;ort there are, who profe&s;s to believe the being and attributes of God, the obligations of natural religion, and that there will be a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; but all this &s;o far only as it is di&s;coverable by the light of nature alone, without believing any divine revelation. The&s;e, he concludes, are the only true Dei&s;ts. But there is now no con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of Dei&s;m in the world. The Heathen philo&s;ophers, tho&s;e few of them who taught and lived up to the obligations of natural religion, had indeed a con|&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of Dei&s;m, &s;o far as it went. Socrates and Tully appear to be wi&s;e and &s;teady in their principles and conduct, and they were thence led to hope for a revelation, and we wi&s;h the
<PB REF="417">&s;ame &s;pirit prevailed in our modern Dei&s;ts; then we might rea|dily conclude they would embrace, and not ridicule Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall &s;ubjoin what I have farther received from an hone&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent Dei&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A Dei&s;t, or Thei&s;t, is one that believes a God, who rejects re|velation, and follows his rea&s;on only. This general definition, I imagine, will be granted by all the Dei&s;ts or Thei&s;ts in the world. Some of them, who believe man to be a free agent, have not much better or different notions of God than other people, believing him to be a perfect, rational, and moral being, &s;ome|where di&s;tinct from the univer&s;e, once from all eternity exi&s;ting by him&s;elf, before any thing was created; but that his wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, is infinitely extended, according as he wills to di&s;play it. Some of them believe free-will, and others not, which is the mo&s;t material difference between them; and this difference ari&s;es from &s;ome mens making more &s;trict natural in|quiries than others. The one think the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity of dangerous con&s;equence; the other, believing things are as they are appointed, or mu&s;t be, conceive this doctrine can no more alter the conduct of men, than the nature of things, which are unalterable and eternal, being governed and directed by the wi&s;|dom of God; his Spirit being in all, operates in all; that in him all creatures live, and have their being; for he is their life, ex|i&s;ts in them, and they in him; and is to the univer&s;e what the &s;oul is to the body; and all the appearances of things to us are the cloathing of Deity; for we &s;ee not things as they are in them|&s;elves, but as they are to us, and &s;o we judge of them; therefore we judge for our&s;elves, not for God; we cannot judge of them as he judges; that of all things generated, which appear and di&s;|appear, it may be &s;aid, as the author of the epi&s;tle to the He|brews &s;ays, "they all wax old as doth a garment, and as a ve&s;|ture God folds them up;" but he is the &s;ame, and his years do not change; neither had the ungenerated parts of the univer&s;e a beginning, nor will ever end. There is no beginning nor end to time, motion, and the exi&s;tence of things; and as God unites the whole, there is no vacuum in nature, no place void of life and exi&s;tence; that vegetable, animal, and rational life, are but different degrees of the &s;ame life, different powers communicated from, or different manife&s;tations of God, who makes and un|makes, builds and de&s;troys, according to his will, which is the &s;ame as his wi&s;dom and power, for the&s;e in him are one.&mdash;Tho&s;e who maintain nece&s;&s;ity have as much regard to moral virtue as others, but not to any kind of wor&s;hip; therefore are more of the philo&s;ophic than of the religious cla&s;s. Like the Epicureans, they think honourably of God, re&s;pecting the greatne&s;s, wonderful|ne&s;s, and dignity of his nature, but, unlike them, they a&s;cribe nothing to chance. They conceive that the divine, unchangeable nature, it not wrought upon by the prayers of men, nor regards
<PB REF="418">their prai&s;es; that the whole of our duty, whether you allow it to be religion or not, is acting in the be&s;t manner we can to|wards one another, as mens different wants are, and our different abilities are to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; that God is not indebted to man for any of his good deeds, though men are to one another; for no man has any good quality, from whence any good deed proceeds, that is not the gift of God; that God makes each of us what we are, and virtue carries its own reward with it, as the ancient phi|lo&s;ophers maintained; the like does wi&s;dom; &s;o has God or|dered the affairs of this world; for if he does not things that are right in this world, how do we know he will do right in any other, who, we have rea&s;on to believe, is in all worlds the &s;ame, and governs all by univer&s;al, mathematical, mechanic, and unchange|able laws?&mdash;In the &s;elect pieces of M. de Voltaire, I find one on Thei&s;m, p. 179, where he &s;ays, that "Thei&s;m is a religion dif|fu&s;ed through all other religions; it is a metal that mixes with all others, and who&s;e veins extend under the earth to the four cor|ners of the world. This ore is mo&s;t uncovered, and mo&s;t wrought, in China; every where el&s;e it is concealed, and the &s;ecret is in the hands of none but the adepts. There is no country in which there are more of the&s;e adepts than in England."&mdash;Many have a&s;ked, if Thei&s;m, &s;eparately con&s;idered, and without any other religious ceremony, is in reality a religion? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y. He who acknowledges a God only as a Creator, he who con&s;i|ders God only as an infinitely powerful Being, and who &s;ees no|thing in his creatures but admirable machines, is no more reli|gious with re&s;pect to him, than an European who admires the King of China is on that account the &s;ubject of that Prince.&mdash; But he who thinks that God has conde&s;cended to put a connection between him&s;elf and mankind; that he has made them free, ca|pable of good and evil; and that he has given to all a moral &s;en&s;e, which is the in&s;tinct in man, and on which is founded the law of nature; he, without doubt, has a religion, and a religion much better than all the &s;ects out of our church: for all the&s;e &s;ects are fal&s;e, and the law of nature is true; for a revealed reli|gion can only be this law of nature perfected. Thus Thei&s;m is good &s;en&s;e not yet enlightened by revelation, and other religions good &s;en&s;e perverted by &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash;All &s;ects are different, be|cau&s;e they come from men; morality is every where the &s;ame, becau&s;e it comes from God.&mdash;It may be a&s;ked, that &s;ince there are five or &s;ix hundred &s;ects, of which &s;carcely any are free from the guilt of &s;pilling human blood, from whence does it happen that the Thei&s;ts, who are every where &s;o numerous, have never cau&s;ed the lea&s;t tumult? It is becau&s;e the&s;e are philo&s;ophers. Now philo&s;ophers may rea&s;on fal&s;ely, but they can never engage in intrigues; therefore tho&s;e who per&s;ecute a philo&s;opher, under pretence that his opinions may be dangerous to the public, are guilty of as great an ab&s;urdity as a per&s;on who &s;hould be afraid
<PB REF="419">le&s;t the &s;tudy of algebra &s;hould rai&s;e the price of bread: we ought, therefore, to pity a rea&s;onable being who is in an error; but the per&s;ecutor is a fool, and an object of horror. We are all brethren: if any of my brothers, full of re&s;pect and filial piety, and animated by the mo&s;t ardent fraternal love, does not &s;alute our common father with the &s;ame ceremonies as I, ought I to cut his throat, and tear out his heart?</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Deprecatory,</HI> or deprecative, in theology, a term applied to the manner of performing &s;ome ceremonies in the form of prayer. Among the Greeks the form of ab&s;olution is deprecatory, being conceived in the&s;e terms, <HI>may God ab&s;olve me;</HI> whereas, in the Latin, and even &s;ome of the reformed churches, it is in the de|clarative form, <HI>I ab&s;olve you.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>De&s;cription,</HI> an imperfect or inaccurate definition of a thing, giving a &s;ort of knowledge thereof from &s;ome accidents and circum|&s;tances peculiar to it, which determine it enough to give an idea that may di&s;tingui&s;h it from other things; but without explaining its nature or e&s;&s;ence. Grammarians content them&s;elves with de|&s;criptions, philo&s;ophers require definitions of things. A de&s;crip|tion is an enumeration of divers attributes of a thing, mo&s;t of which are only accidental, as when a per&s;on is de&s;cribed by his deeds, his &s;ayings, his writings, his honours, &amp;c. A de&s;crip|tion, as to its outward appearance, re&s;embles a definition, and is even convertible with the thing de&s;cribed, but does not explain it; for in&s;tead of bringing &s;everal things e&s;&s;ential to the thing de&s;cribed, it only brings a number of accidents belonging thereto, e. g. Peter is the tall young man who lives on the green, wears black cloaths, frequents the college, courts N&mdash;, &amp;c. where, it is evident, we do not give any explication of Peter, as not bringing things that are in Peter, but only circum&s;tances, or things about him, tall, young, living, wearing, frequenting, courting, &amp;c. A de&s;cription, therefore, is no proper an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, <HI>quid e&s;t, what is he?</HI> but to that, <HI>quis e&s;t, who is he?</HI> De&s;criptions, in effect, are principally u&s;ed for &s;ingulars or individuals, for things of the &s;ame &s;pecies do not differ in e&s;&s;ence, but only as to <HI>hic</HI> and <HI>ille,</HI> which difference contains nothing very notable or di&s;tingui&s;hable. But individuals, of the &s;ame kind, differ much in accidents, e. g. George is a King, and William a citizen, Charles is a male, and Anne a female; Hen|ry is wife, and John a blockhead, &amp;c. Thus, a de&s;cription is an accumulation of accidents, whereby things are notably di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from each other, tho' they &s;carce differ at all in e&s;&s;ence.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Diet,</HI> an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of Germany. I &s;hall only take no|tice, in this place, of the more remarkable of tho&s;e which have been held on the affairs of religion.&mdash;1. The diet of Aug&s;burg, in the year 1530, was a&s;&s;embled to reunite the Princes of the empire, in relation to &s;ome religious matters; the Emperor him|&s;elf pre&s;ided in this a&s;&s;embly with the greate&s;t magnificence ima|ginable. The Elector of Saxony followed by &s;everal Princes, pre&s;ented the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, called, The Confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg. The Emperor ended the diet with a decree, that no alteration &s;hould be made in the doctrine and ceremonies of the Romi&s;h church, till a council &s;hould order it otherwi&s;e.&mdash; 2. The diet of Aug&s;burg, in 1547, was held on account of the Electors being divided concerning the deci&s;ions of the council of Trent. The Emperor demanded, that the management of that affair &s;hould be referred to him; and it was re&s;olved, that every one &s;hould conform to the deci&s;ions of the council&mdash;3. The diet of Aug&s;burg, in 1548, was a&s;&s;embled to examine &s;ome memorials, relating to the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; but the commi&s;|&s;ioners not agreeing together, the Emperor named three divines, who drew the de&s;ign of that famous Interim, &s;o well known in Germany, and el&s;ewhere.&mdash;4. The diet of Aug&s;burg, in 1550. In this a&s;&s;embly the Emperor complained, that the Interim was not ob&s;erved, and demanded that all &s;hould &s;ubmit to the council which they were going to renew at Trent, which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was re&s;ol&s;ed upon by a plurality of votes.&mdash;5. The diet of Nurem|berg in 1523. Here Pope Adrian VI.'s nuncio demanded the execution of Leo X.'s bull, and Charles V.'s edict, again&s;t Lu|ther; but the a&s;&s;embly drew up a li&s;t of grievances, which were reduced to an hundred articles; &s;ome whereof aime, at the de|&s;truction
<PB REF="421">of the Pope's authority, and the di&s;cipline of the Ro|mi&s;h church: however, they con&s;ented that the Lutherans &s;hould be commanded not to write again&s;t the Roman Catholics.&mdash; 6. The diet of Nuremberg, in 1524. In this a&s;&s;embly the Lu|therans having the advantage, it was decreed, that the Pope &s;hould call a council in Germany; but that, in the mean time, an a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be held at Spire, to determine what was to be believed and practi&s;ed. But Charles V. prohibited the holding this a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;7. The diet of Rati&s;bon, in 1541, was held for reuniting the Prote&s;tants with the Roman Catholics. The Em|peror named three Roman Catholics and three Prote&s;tant divines, to agree upon articles. The Roman Catholics were Julius Phlug, John Gropper, and John Eckius; and the Prote&s;tants were Philip Melanchton, Martin Bucer, and John Pi&s;torius: but after a whole month's con&s;ultation, they could agree upon no more than five or &s;ix articles, which the Emperor con&s;ented the Prote&s;tants &s;hould retain, forbidding them to &s;olicit any body to change the ancient religion.&mdash;8. The diet of Rati&s;bon, in 1546, decreed, that the council of Trent was to be followed, which was oppo&s;ed by the Prote&s;tant deputies, and this cau&s;ed a war again&s;t them.&mdash;9. The diet of Rati&s;bon, in 1557, demanded a conference between &s;ome famous doctors of both parties, which conference was held at Worms, in September, between twelve Roman Catholics, and twelve Lutheran divines; but was &s;oon di&s;&s;olved by the Lutherant being divided among them&s;elves.&mdash;10. The diet of Spire, in 1526. In this a&s;&s;embly, wherein pre&s;ided the Archduke Ferdi|nand, the Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e demanded the free exerci&s;e of the Lutheran religion: upon which it was de|creed, that the Emperor &s;hould be de&s;ired to call a general or na|tional council in Germany within a year, and that in the mean time every one &s;hould have liberty of con&s;cience.&mdash;11. The diet of Spire, in 1529, decreed, that in the countries, which had em|braced the new religion, it &s;hould be lawful to continue in it till the next council; but that no Roman Catholic &s;hould be allowed to turn Lutheran. Again&s;t this decree, &s;ix Lutheran Princes, viz. The Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburg, the two Dukes of Lunenburg, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and the Prince of Anhalt, with the deputies of fourteen imperial towns, prete&s;ted in writing, from which &s;olemn prote&s;tation came the famous name of Prote&s;tants, which the Lutherans pre&s;ently after took.&mdash;12. The diet of Worms, in 1521. In this a&s;&s;embly Luther, being charged by the Pope's Nuncio with here&s;y, and refu&s;ing to recant, the Emperor, by his edict of May 26, before all the Princes of Germany, publickly outlawed him.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Directory,</HI> a kind of regulation for the performance of religious wor&s;hip, drawn up by the a&s;&s;embly of divines in England, at the in&s;tance of the parliament, in the year 1644. It was de&s;igned to &s;upply the place of the Liturgy, or Book of Common-Prayer, the u&s;e of which they had aboli&s;hed: it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome general heads, which were to be managed and filled up at di&s;cretion, for it pre&s;cribed no form of prayer or circum&s;tances of external wor|&s;hip, nor obliged the people to any re&s;pon&s;es, excepting Amen.&mdash; To give a &s;hort ab&s;tract of the Directory: It forbids all &s;alutati|ons, and civil ceremony, in the churches; the reading the &s;crip|tures in the congregation is declared to be part of the pa&s;toral office; all the canonical books of the Old and New Te&s;tament (but not of the Apocrypha) are to be publickly read in the vulgar tongue; how large a portion is to be read at once, is left to the mini&s;ter, who has likewi&s;e the liberty of expounding when he judges it nece&s;&s;ary. It pre&s;cribes heads for the prayer before &s;er|mon, among which, part of the prayer for the King is, to &s;ave him from evil council: it delivers rules for managing the &s;ermon; the introduction to the text mu&s;t be &s;hort and clear, drawn from the words, or context, or &s;ome parallel place of &s;cripture; in dividing the text, the mini&s;ter is to regard the order of the matter, more than that of the words; he is not to burthen the memory of his audience with too many divi&s;ions, nor perplex their under|&s;tandings with logical phra&s;es and terms of art; he is not to &s;tart unnece&s;&s;ary objections, and he is to be very &s;paring in citati|ons from eccle&s;ia&s;tical or other human writers, ancient or modern. The Directory recommends the u&s;e of the Lord's Prayer, as the mo&s;t perfect model of devotion; it forbids private or lay per&s;ons to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, and enjoins it to be performed in the face of the congregation; it orders the communion table, at the Lord's &s;upper, to be &s;o placed, that the communicants may &s;it about it. The dead, according to the rules of the Directory, are to be bu|ried without any prayers, or religious ceremony.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> (Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.) The Chri&s;tian church being a &s;piritual community or &s;ociety of per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the religion of Je&s;us, and, as &s;uch, governed by &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, her di&s;|cipline con&s;i&s;ts in putting tho&s;e laws in execution, and inflicting the penalties enjoined by them again&s;t &s;everal &s;orts of offenders. To under&s;tand the true nature of church-di&s;cipline, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider
<PB REF="423">how it &s;tood in the ancient Chri&s;tian church. And, fir&s;t, The primitive church never pretended to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline upon any, but &s;uch as were within her pale, in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e, by &s;ome act of their own profe&s;&s;ion, and even upon the&s;e &s;he never pretended to exerci&s;e her di&s;cipline &s;o far as to cancel or di&s;annul their bapti&s;m; but the di&s;cipline of the church con&s;i&s;ted in a power to deprive men of the benefits of external communion; &s;uch as pub|lic prayer, receiving the euchari&s;t, and other acts of divine wor|&s;hip. This power, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church by human laws, was a mere &s;piritual authority, or, as St. Cyprian terms it, a &s;piritual &s;word, affecting the &s;oul, and not the body. Sometimes indeed the church craved a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the &s;ecular power, even when it was Heathen, but more frequently after it became Chri&s;tian: but it is to be ob&s;erved, that the church never encouraged the magi&s;trate to proceed again&s;t any one, for mere error, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical mi&s;demeanor, farther than to puni&s;h the delinquent by a pecuniary mulct, or bodily puni&s;hment, &s;uch as a confi&s;cation or bani&s;hment. And St. Au&s;tin affirms, that no good men in the Catholic church were plea&s;ed, that he|retics &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted unto death; le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments, they thought, might have their u&s;e, as a means &s;ometimes to bring them to con&s;ideration and repentance; nor was it a part of the ancient di&s;cipline to deprive men of their natural or civil rights; a ma&s;ter did not lo&s;e his authority over his family, a parent over his children, nor a magi&s;trate his office or charge in the &s;tate, by being ca&s;t out of the church. But the di&s;cipline of the church being a mere &s;piritual power, was confined to, 1. Admonition of the offender. 2. The le&s;&s;er and greater excommunication.&mdash; As to the object of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, they were all &s;uch de|linquents as fell into great and &s;candalous crimes after bapti&s;m, whether men or women, prie&s;ts or people, rich or poor, princes or &s;ubjects. That princes and magi&s;trates fell under the church's cen&s;ures, may be proved by &s;everal in&s;tances; particularly St. Chry&s;o&s;tom relates, that Babylas denied communion to one of the Roman Emperors, on account of a barbarous murder committed by him. St. Ambro&s;e likewi&s;e denied communion to Maximus, for &s;hedding the blood of Gratian; and the &s;ame holy Bi&s;hop ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to admit the Emperor Theodo&s;ius the Great into his church, notwith&s;tanding his humble&s;t intreaties, becau&s;e he had inhumanly put to death &s;even thou&s;and men at The&s;&s;alo|nica, without di&s;tingui&s;hing the innocent from the guilty.</ITEM>

Acts ix. 10. The name di&s;ciple is often &s;et down for that of a|po&s;tle; but in other places they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from di&s;ciples, as they were particularly cho&s;en by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, out of the num|ber

<ITEM><HI>Deminicans,</HI> an order of religious, called in &s;ome places Jacobins, Predicants, or Preaching Friars. They take this name from their founder Dominic de Guzman, born in 1170, at Calarvega, in Old Ca&s;tile.

<ITEM><HI>Donative,</HI> in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;en&s;e of the word, is a benefice given by the patron to the prie&s;t without pre&s;entation of the ordinary, and without in&s;titution and induction. As to the origin of dona|tives, it was one of the&s;e two ways. Fir&s;t, by royal licence. Thus Sir Edward Coke &s;ays, the King may not only found a church or free chapel donative, but may licence any &s;ubject to do the &s;ame. Secondly, Donatives may be grounded upon peculiar privilege; as, when a Lord of a manor, in a great pari&s;h, at a remote di&s;|tance from his pari&s;h-church, offers to build and endow a church there, provided it &s;hall entirely belong to him and his family, to put in what incumbent they &s;hall think fit: the Bi&s;hops, to encou|rage &s;uch a work, may have permitted them to enjoy this liberty;

<ITEM><HI>EASTER,</HI> a fe&s;tival of the Chri&s;tian church, ob&s;erved in me|mory of our Saviour's re&s;urrection. The Latins and others call it Pa&s;cha, an Hebrew word, which &s;ignifies pa&s;&s;age, and it is applied to the Jewi&s;h fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, to which the Chri&s;tian fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter corre&s;ponds. This fe&s;tival is called in Engli&s;h Ea&s;ter, from the Saxon Ea&s;tre, an ancient godde&s;s of that people, wor&s;hipped with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April. Concerning the celebration of this fe&s;tival, there were anciently very great di&s;putes in the church. Tho' all agreed in the ob&s;er|vation of it in general, yet they differed very much as to the par|ticular time when it was to be ob&s;erved; &s;ome keeping it preci&s;ely on the &s;ame &s;tated day every year, others on the fourteenth day of the fir&s;t moon in the new year, whatever day of the week it hap|pened on; and others, on the fir&s;t Sunday after the fir&s;t full moon. This diver&s;ity occa&s;ioned a great di&s;pute in the 2d century, between the A&s;iatic churches and the re&s;t of the world; in the cour&s;e of which, Pope Victor excommunicated all tho&s;e churches: but the council of Nice, in the year 324, decreed, that all churches &s;hould keep the Pa&s;cha, or fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, on one and the &s;ame day, which is always on a Sunday. This decree was afterwards confirmed by the council of Antioch, in the year 344: yet this did not put an end to all di&s;putes concerning the ob&s;ervation of this fe&s;tival; for it was not ea&s;y to determine on what Sunday it was to be held, becau&s;e, being a moveable fea&s;t, it &s;ometimes hap|pened
<PB REF="426">that the churches of one country kept it a week or a month &s;ooner than other churches, by rea&s;on of their different calculations: therefore the council of Nice is &s;aid to have decreed farther, that the Bi&s;hops of Alexandria &s;hould adju&s;t a proper cycle, and inform the re&s;t of the world on what Sunday every year Ea&s;ter was to be ob&s;erved; notwith&s;tanding which the Roman and Alexandrian accounts continued to differ, and &s;ometimes va|ried a week or a month from each other; and no effectual cure was found for this, till, in the year 525, Diony&s;ius Exiguus brought the Alexandrian canon or cycle entirely into u&s;e in the Roman church. Mean time, the churches of France and Britain kept to the old Roman canon; and it was two or three ages af|ter before the new Roman, that is, the Alexandrian canon, not without &s;ome &s;truggle and difficulty, was &s;ettled among them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ebionites,</HI> Chri&s;tian heretics, in the fir&s;t century, &s;o called from their leader Ebion. The Ebionites, as well as the Nazarenes, had their origin from the circumci&s;ed Chri&s;tians, who had retired from Jeru&s;alem to Pella during the war between the Jews and Romans, and made their fir&s;t appearance after the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, about the time of Domitian, or a little before. Ebion, the author of the here&s;y of the Ebionites, was a di&s;ciple of Cerin|thus, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He improved upon the errors of his ma&s;ter, and added to them new opinions of his own. He began his preaching in Judea; he taught in A&s;ia, and even at Rome; his tenets infected the i&s;le of Cyprus. St. John oppo&s;ed both Cerin|thus and Ebion in A&s;ia; and it is thought that this Apo&s;tle wrote his go&s;pel in the year 97, particularly again&s;t this here&s;y. The Ebionites held the &s;ame errors as the Nazarenes; they united the ceremonies of the law with the precepts of the go&s;pel; they ob|&s;erved both the Jewi&s;h Sabbath and the Chri&s;tian Sunday; they called their place of a&s;&s;embling a &s;ynagogue, and not a church; they bathed every day, which was the cu&s;tom of the Jews. In celebrating the euchari&s;t, they made u&s;e of unleavened bread, but no wine. They added to the ob&s;ervance of the law divers &s;u|per&s;titions; they adored Jeru&s;alem as the hou&s;e of God. Like the Samaritans, they would not &s;uffer a per&s;on of another religion to touch them; they ab&s;tained from the fle&s;h of animals, and even from milk; and le&s;t any one &s;hould object to them that pa&s;&s;age of the go&s;pel where Je&s;us &s;ays, he de&s;ires to eat of the pa&s;&s;over, they corrupted it. When they were &s;ick, or bitten by a &s;erpent, they plunged them&s;elves into water, and invoked all &s;orts of things to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They di&s;agreed among them&s;elves in relation to Chri&s;t: &s;ome of them &s;aid he was born, like other men, of Jo&s;eph and Mary, and acquired &s;anctification only by his good works; others of them allowed that he was born of a virgin, but denied that he was the Word of God, or had a pre-exi&s;tence before his human generation: they &s;aid he was indeed the only true prophet, but yet a mere man, who by his virtue had arrived
<PB REF="427">at being called Chri&s;t, and the Son of God. They &s;uppo&s;ed that Chri&s;t and the devil were two principles, which God had oppo|&s;ed the one to the other. Though the Ebionites ob&s;erved the law, yet they differed from the Jews in many points. They acknow|ledged the &s;anctity of Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, Mo&s;es, Aaron, and Jo&s;hua; but they laughed at all tho&s;e who came after them: they rejected &s;ome parts of the Pentateuch; and when they were too clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by this book, they entirely abandoned it. Of the New Te&s;tament they acknowledge only the go&s;pel of St. Mat|thew; that is, that which was written in Hebrew, and which they called the go&s;pel according to the Hebrews; but they took from it the two fir&s;t chapters, and corrupted other pa&s;&s;ages of it. They ab&s;olutely rejected St. Paul, as an apo&s;tate, and an enemy of the law, and publi&s;hed &s;everal calumnies again&s;t him. They had likewi&s;e fal&s;e Acts of the Apo&s;tles, in which they mixed a great many fables. As to their manner of life, they imitated the Carpocratians, the mo&s;t infamous of all heretics. They rejected virginity and continence; they obliged children to marry very young; they allowed married per&s;ons to &s;eparate from each o|ther, and marry again as often as they plea&s;ed. St. Ju&s;tin, St. Irenaeus, and Origen, wrote again&s;t the Ebionites. Symmachus, author of one of the Greek ver&s;ions of the &s;criptures, was an Ebionite.</ITEM>

Such likewi&s;e, afterwards, were tho&s;e who held the fir&s;t rank in the &s;ynagogue, the pre&s;ident or head of which was &s;tiled elder, by way of eminence.

<ITEM><HI>Ember-Weeks,</HI> or <HI>Days,</HI> in the Chri&s;tian church.

The&s;e ordination-fa&s;ts are ob&s;erved four times in the year, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wedne&s;day, Friday, and Saturday, after the fir&s;t Sunday in Lent, after Whit&s;unday, after the 14th of September, and after the 13th of December; it being injoined by a canon of the church, that deacons and mini&s;ters be ordained or made only upon the Sundays immediately following the&s;e Ember-fa&s;ts. Some derive the term <HI>Ember</HI> from a German word, which &s;ignifies ab&s;tinence; others from one which &s;ignifies a&s;hes, becau&s;e it was cu&s;tomary with the ancients to accompany their fa&s;tings with &s;prinkling of a&s;hes, or &s;itting upon them.

The Ember-weeks were formerly ob&s;erved in different churches with &s;ome variety, but were at la&s;t &s;ettled, as they are now ob|&s;erved, by the council of Placentia, A. D. 1095. St. Auou&s;tin, who lived in the fifth century, &s;peaks of the Ember-faits, but mentions them only as ob&s;erved in the dioce&s;e of Rome; from whence we may conclude, that the ob&s;ervation of them was not at that time general in the church. The council of Mentz, con|vened by Charlemagne in 813, mentions the Ember weeks as a new e&s;tabli&s;hment introduced in France, in conformity to the Ro|man church.</ITEM>

<P>Saturday, September 7, 1754, after &s;piritual de&s;ertion and wan|dering &s;ome days in the wilderne&s;s, the love of God returned to my &s;oul, and I again rejoiced in Chri&s;t as my Saviour. Glory be to God for his free and boundle&s;s mercy to the vile&s;t of &s;inners, to the mo&s;t unworthy and ungrateful of all human beings! And, oh! Lord, life and light of my &s;oul, leave me not again, I hum|bly be&s;eech thee; let every outward comfort be withdrawn, and every outward torment be inflicted, and I will rejoice &s;o thou leave me not. My helple&s;s &s;oul hangs upon thee, my Je&s;us, and well thou knowe&s;t what I have &s;uffered in thy ab&s;ence; how my parched &s;oul has fainted for thy refre&s;hing &s;treams; how it has &s;tretched it&s;elf out after thee, and even agoni&s;ed to find thee, and then mi&s;erably &s;unk, and been overwhelmed under the mountain of fin.

<PB REF="431">in the univer&s;e; but this unworthine&s;s will the more magnify thy mercy. I have only my unworthine&s;s to plead, and I have no hope but in thine atoning blood.

<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts then, in the religious &s;en&s;e of the word, are tho&s;e who pretend to extraordinary revelations and impul&s;es from heaven.

Hence we &s;ee, that in all ages, men, in whom melancholy has mixed with devotion, or who&s;e conceit of them&s;elves has rai&s;ed them into an opinion of a great familiarity with God, and a nearer admittance to his fa|vour than is afforded to others, have often flattered them&s;elves with a per&s;ua&s;ion of an immediate intercour&s;e with the Deity, and frequent communications from the divine Spirit. Their minds being thus prepared, whatever groundle&s;s opinion comes to &s;ettle it&s;elf &s;trongly upon then fancies, is an illumination from the Spi|rit of God, and pre&s;ently of divine authority, and what&s;oever odd action they find in them&s;elves a &s;trong inclination to do, that im|pul&s;e is concluded to be a call or direction from heaven, and mu&s;t be obeyed; it is a commi&s;&s;ion from above, and they cannot err in executing it.

That it was not in reality a &s;tar, is cer|tain, becau&s;e it went before them, and &s;tood over where the young child was, which could not be true of any one of the heavenly bo|dies. It mu&s;t therefore be a luminous appearance, or &s;eeming &s;tar in the lower region of the air, ob&s;erved by the wi&s;e men to differ from the ordinary &s;tars of heaven, which, as a new and prodigious &s;ight, &s;eemed to them to pre&s;age &s;omething of great moment and con&s;ideration. Some authors have &s;ugge&s;ted, that this &s;eeming &s;tar which appeared to the wi&s;e men in the Ea&s;t, might be that glorious light which &s;hone upon the &s;hepherds of Beth|lehem when the angels came to impart to them the tidings of our Saviour's birth, and which, at a di&s;tance, might appear like a &s;tar. Another que&s;tion is, how the wi&s;e men could gue&s;s at the birth of our Saviour from the appearance of this &s;tar? The mo&s;t probable an&s;wer is, that they did not collect the birth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from this uncommon appearance (which only &s;erved as their guide in finding him out) but were determined to their jour|ney by the general expectation the ea&s;tern world was then in of an univer&s;al monarch. The fea&s;t of Epiphany was not originally a di&s;tinct fe&s;tival, but made a part of that of the nativity of Chri&s;t, which being celebrated twelve days, the fir&s;t and la&s;t of which, according to the cu&s;tom of the Jews, in their fea&s;ts, were high or chief days of this &s;olemnity; either of the&s;e might be fitly called Epiphany, as that word &s;ignifies the appearance of Chri&s;t in the world.</ITEM>

The ideas of eternity and &s;elf-exi&s;tence are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, that becau&s;e &s;omething of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be eternal, independently, and without any outward cau&s;e of its be|ing, therefore it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;elf-exi&s;tent; and becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;elf-exi&s;tent, therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be eternal. To be &s;elf-exi&s;tent, is to exi&s;t by an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of the thing it&s;elf; now this nece&s;&s;ity being ab&s;olute, and not depending upon any thing eternal, mu&s;t be always unalterably the &s;ame, nothing be|ing alterable but what is capable of being affected by &s;ome|what without it&s;elf. That Being therefore, which has no other cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence, but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of its own nature, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have exi&s;ted from everla&s;ting without end.&mdash;As to the manner of this eternal exi&s;tence, it is manife&s;t, it herein infinitely tran&s;cends the manner of the exi&s;tence of all created beings, even of &s;uch as &s;hall exi&s;t for ever, that whereas it is not po&s;&s;ible for their finite minds to comprehend all that is pa&s;t, or to under&s;tand perfectly all the things that are pre&s;ent, much le&s;s to know all that is future, or to have entirely in their power any thing that is to come; but their thoughts, knowledge, and power, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have degrees and periods, and be &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and tran&s;i|ent, as the things them&s;elves. The eternal, &s;upreme Cau&s;e, on the contrary, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have &s;uch a perfect independent unchangeable comprehen&s;ion of all things, that there can be no one point or in&s;tant of his eternal duration, wherein all things that are pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, will not be as entirely known, and repre&s;ented to him, in one &s;ingle thought or view, and all things pre&s;ent and future be equally and entirely in his power and direction, as if there was no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at all, but all things were actually pre&s;ent at once.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI> This word &s;ignifies one who publi&s;hes good news: they therefore who write, as well as they who preach the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are called Evangeli&s;ts; and, in general, all they who declare any happy tidings. In I&s;aiah the Lord &s;ays, that he will give to Jeru&s;alem one that bringeth good tidings, or an Evan|geli&s;t. In the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, Philip, one of the deacons, is called an Evangeli&s;t. They were generally ranked below the Apo&s;tles and Prophers, tho' their office and duty was honourable and &s;acred. In the beginning of Chri&s;tianity, there were Evan|geli&s;ts and preachers, who, without being fixed to any church, went and preached wherever they might be mo&s;t u&s;eful. La&s;tly, we commonly call Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Evange|li&s;ts,

This Here&s;iarch had been educated by Lucian the martyr. As he was of a &s;ubtile and penetrating genius, he thought to rai&s;e his reputation by undertaking the &s;upport of Ari|ani&s;m. The &s;ucce&s;s an&s;wered his hopes: he was cho&s;en by the Arians Bi&s;hop of Germanicia, in Syria. He oppo&s;ed the divinity of the word, in the council of Antioch, in 341, and afterwards in the Arian councils of Sardica, Sirium, and Seleucia. He became the Patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, by the favour of the Emperor Con&s;tantius. He engaged the Emperor Valens, by an oath, to &s;upport the cau&s;e of Ariani&s;m. After the death of Arius, he be|came head of the Arian party, who from him took the name Eudoxians.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Eutychians,</HI> a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, di&s;ciples of Eutyches, a monk, and abbot of Con&s;tantinople, in the 5th century. Eutyches, anima|ted by a fal&s;e zeal again&s;t the errors of Ne&s;torius, fell into the op|po&s;ite impiety, and maintained, that there was but one nature in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, becau&s;e there was but one per&s;on. He pretended that the divine nature, by its &s;uperiority, had &s;o entirely &s;wallowed up the human, that the latter could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in&s;omuch, that, according to Eutyches, Je&s;us Chri&s;t was merely God, that he had nothing of humanity but the appearance. Flavian, Patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, &s;trongly oppo&s;ed this doc|trine; and Eutyches was condemned in a council held in 448: which &s;entence was confirmed by the general council of Chalce|don in 451. Eutyches re&s;i&s;ted the council of Con&s;tantinople, and
<PB REF="435">would not alter his expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the two natures in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; becau&s;e he would not, he &s;aid, condemn the holy fathers, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ticularly St. Cyril and St. Athane&s;ius, who had expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves in the &s;ame manner.

Leontius, &s;uperior of the Scythian monks, re|vived the here&s;y of Eutyches, about the year 600, and maintained that we ought to &s;ay, one of three per&s;ons in the Trinity &s;uffered on the cro&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Exarch,</HI> in the Greek church, is an officer under the Patriarch, who has the care and in&s;pection of the patriarchal mona&s;teries, or &s;uch as depend immediately on the Patriarch. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to vi&s;it them, to hear the complaints of inferiors again&s;t their &s;uperiors, to impo&s;e penance, and cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e monks who neglect their duty, and the obedience they owe their &s;uperiors. When a &s;upe|rior of a patriarchal mona&s;tery is dead, the exarch is to take care and &s;end the per&s;on elected by the monks to &s;ucceed him, to the Patriarch, for impo&s;ition of hands. He is to take an exact ac|count of all the mona&s;teries depending on the Patriarch, of their revenues, &s;acred ve&s;&s;els, and ornaments. For this purpo&s;e the exarch receives letters te&s;timonial from the Patriarch, which he is obliged to produce and &s;hew to the monks, that they may not doubt of his authority.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Excommunication,</HI> an eccle&s;ia&s;tical penalty, whereby they who incur the guilt of any heinous &s;in are &s;eparated from the communion of the church, and deprived of all &s;piritual advantages. There are two or three &s;orts of excommunication: the greater, whereby the per&s;on offending is &s;eparated from the body of the faithful; thus St. Paul excommunicated the ince&s;tuous Chri&s;tian, 1 Cor. vi. 5. The le&s;&s;er, whereby the &s;inner is forbidden to admin&s;ter or re|ceive the &s;acraments: and, la&s;tly, that which deprives him only of the company of the faithful, of which there is &s;ome mention made, 2 Cor. iii. 6. and by St. Au&s;tin. Theophilact &s;ays, that even this &s;eparation was formerly e&s;teemed a great puni&s;hment. The pri|mitive Chri&s;tians very rarely excommunicated; and when they were, it was for very important rea&s;ons, with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and concern. Excommunication of Emperors, Kings, &amp;c. by the au|thority of the Pope, began in the 9th century.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>FAITH,</HI> is a theological virtue, whereby we hold for certain that there is a God, and are per&s;uaded to believe tho&s;e truths
<PB REF="436">revealed in the &s;criptures. This faith, accompanied with the prac|tice of good works, is the life of a righteous man: "The ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith." It may be con&s;idered either as proceeding from God, who reveals his truths; or man, who yields his a&s;&s;ent to them: and in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es it is called faith. "Shall the unbelief of the Jews make the faith of God of none effect?" &s;ays St. Paul; that is to &s;ay, his &s;overeign and infallible truth. Faith is taken al&s;o for a firm confidence in God, whereby we are induced to addre&s;s our&s;elves to him for favours. Faith is &s;ometimes taken for hone&s;ty, fidelity in performing promi&s;es, truth; and in this &s;en&s;e it is applied both to God and man. Faith in general is the a&s;&s;ent of the mind to the truth of any propo&s;ition.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Farrelli&s;ts,</HI> a Chri&s;tian &s;ect, which &s;prung up in the 16th century, &s;o called from their founder William Farrel, a native of Dauphiny, who, about the year 1525, taught at Geneva the doctrines of the Samaritans, particularly the efficacy of the &s;acraments. He per|&s;uaded his di&s;ciples, that a man, to &s;ave life and goods, might deny, or di&s;&s;emble, his faith before per&s;ecutors. By this means he gained over a great number of followers, who outwardly pro|fe&s;&s;ed all &s;orts of religion, but &s;ecretly followed only their own doctrine, which con&s;i&s;ted in believing alone, without being obliged to practi&s;e any good works. Calvin, who&s;e influence in Geneva was very great, prevailed with the magi&s;trates to bani&s;h Farrel, who retired to Neuf-Chatel, where he exerci&s;ed the office of a mini&s;ter &s;ome years, and died in 1565.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fa&s;ting.</HI> This has in all ages, and among all nations, been an ex|erci&s;e much in u&s;e in time of mourning, &s;orrow, and affliction; but we find no example of it, or injunction for it, before Mo&s;es. The Jews at this time are very &s;trict in the ob&s;ervance of them. In their common fa&s;ts they begin the ob&s;ervance of them the pre|ceding evening after &s;un-&s;et, and fa&s;t till the &s;ame hour the next evening; and, on the great day of atonement, they continue their fa&s;t twenty-eight hours. During this fa&s;t, they not only ab&s;tain from all &s;orts of food, but from bathings, perfumes, odours, cor|dials, &amp;c. they go barefoot, are continent, and make no u&s;e of marriage. This is the idea which the ea&s;tern people have of fa&s;t|ing. It is an ab&s;tinence from every &s;en&s;ual gratification, as well as every kind of eating and drinking.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fa&s;ts,</HI> days of religious ab&s;tinence. Such &s;olemnities have been ob|&s;erved in all ages and nations, e&s;pecially in times of mourning and affliction. We meet with no examples of fa&s;ting, properly &s;o called, before Mo&s;es, who yet enjoins no other than the &s;olemn day of expiation, which was generally and &s;trictly ob&s;erved. Be|&s;ides the &s;olemn fa&s;t of expiation, in&s;tituted by divine authority, the Jews appointed certain times of fa&s;ting and humiliation, called
<PB REF="437">the fa&s;ts of the congregation. But, be&s;ides the public fa&s;ts, which the Jews were obliged by their law to ob&s;erve, there were others of a private nature, which the zealous and mo&s;t pious among them pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves. The common way of fa&s;ting among the Jews is, to take no food, nor any drink, from the foregoing evening till &s;un-&s;et the day following. They are allowed &s;ome particular herbs and butter, but not eggs. They mu&s;t not be &s;haved, or powdered, or bathe them&s;elves. They e&s;teem fa&s;ting as a &s;upplement to the old &s;acrifices, and place great merit in it. The ancient Chri&s;tians had two &s;orts of &s;olemn fa&s;ts, the one weekly, the other annual. Their weekly fa&s;ts, called <HI>jejunia quartae &amp; &s;extae feriae,</HI> were ob&s;erved on Wedne&s;days and Fridays; becau&s;e on Wedne&s;day our Lord was betrayed by Judas, and on Friday crucified by the Jews. The&s;e fa&s;ts la&s;ted till the ninth hour, that is, till three o'clock in the afternoon, at which time they received the euchari&s;t. They called the&s;e fa&s;ts &s;tations, and the remains of them are yet ob&s;erved in our church, which by her 15th canon has ordained, that tho' Wedne&s;days and Fridays be not holy days, yet that weekly, upon tho&s;e times, the mini&s;ter and people &s;hall re&s;ort to church, at the accu&s;tomed hour of prayer. Their annual fa&s;t was that of Lent. They had likewi&s;e their oc|ca&s;ional fa&s;ts, ob&s;erved at extraordinary and unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons, ac|cording as the variety and nece&s;&s;ity of their circum&s;tances required. Such were, times of great and imminent danger, either to the church or &s;tate, and times of public calamities, as plague or per&s;ecution. The&s;e occa&s;ional fa&s;ts were appointed by the Bi&s;hops of every church as they thought fit: they were called, by way of eminence, <HI>Jejunia.</HI> The Greeks have four &s;olemn fa&s;ts: the fir&s;t commences on the 15th of November, or forty days before Chri&s;tmas; it is ob&s;erved in commemoration of Mo&s;es's fa&s;ting forty days on Mount Sinai: the &s;econd falls in with our Lent: the third is called the fa&s;t of the holy Apo&s;tles, which they ob&s;erve upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that the Apo&s;tles prepared them&s;elves by prayer and fa&s;ting for the promulgation of the go&s;pel. This fa&s;t com|mences the week after Whit&s;untide, and continues till the fe&s;tival of St. Peter and St. Paul. Their fourth fa&s;t commences the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, and la&s;ts until the 15th. The Greeks are &s;o &s;uper&s;ti|tious and extravagant in the ob&s;ervation of their fa&s;ts, that they will admit of no ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a di&s;pen&s;a|tion. The Patriarch him&s;elf cannot authori&s;e any per&s;on to eat meat when the church has enjoined the contrary. The Romani&s;ts di&s;tingui&s;h between fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence, and different days are appointed for each of them in that church. On their days of fa&s;ting they are allowed but one meal in twenty-four hours; but on days of ab&s;tinence, provided they ab&s;tain from fle&s;h, and make but a moderate meal, they are indulged in a collation at night. The times of fa&s;ting, appointed by that church, are all Lent, except Sundays, the Ember days, the vigils of the more
<PB REF="438">&s;olemn fea&s;ts, and all Fridays, except tho&s;e that fall within the twelve days of Chri&s;tmas, and between Ea&s;ter and the A&s;cen&s;ion. Their days of ab&s;tinence are, all the Sundays in Lent, St. Mark's day, if it does not fall in Ea&s;ter week, the three Rogation days, all Saturdays throughout the year, with the Fridays before excepted, unle&s;s either happens to be Chri&s;tmas-day. The church of Eng|land, tho' it appoints days of fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence, for it makes no di&s;tinction between them, does not determine what food is proper for &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons; and there is a &s;tatute, which declares, that who&s;oever, by preaching, teaching, writing, &amp;c. affirms it to be nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;tain from fle&s;h, for the &s;aving of the &s;oul of man, or for the &s;ervice of God, is to be puni&s;hed as a &s;preader of fal&s;e news: but notwith&s;tanding this, the church declares in one of her homilies, that fa&s;ting, by the decree of the 630 fathers, a&s;&s;embled at the council of Chalcedon, which was one of the fir&s;t four general councils, who grounded their determinations upon the &s;acred &s;criptures, and long continued u&s;age or practice both of the prophets and other godly per&s;ons, before the coming of Chri&s;t, and al&s;o of the Apo&s;tles, and other devout men, in the New Te&s;ta|ment, is a withholding meat, drink, and all natural food, from the body, for the determined time of fa&s;ting. The times &s;he &s;ets a|part, as proper for this duty, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e ob&s;erved in the earlie&s;t ages of the church.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fea&s;ts.</HI> God, in his great wi&s;dom, appointed &s;everal fe&s;tivals among the Jews: 1. To perpetuate the memory of the&s;e great events and wonders which he had wrought in favour of his people. 2. To keep them firm to their religion. 3. To encourage them by in|tervals of re&s;t and plea&s;ure; for their fe&s;tivals were accompanied with rejoicings, with fea&s;ts of charity, and with innocent diver|&s;ions. 4. For in&s;truction; for at tho&s;e times there were &s;ea&s;ons when the law of God was read and explained. 5. To renew and confirm their acquaintance and friend&s;hip with their tribes. The Hebrews had a great number of fea&s;ts, as the Sabbath, the Sab|batical year, the Pa&s;&s;over, the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, of Trumpets, of New-moons, of Expiation, of Tabernacles, and occa&s;ional, as that at the dedication of the Temple, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Fe&s;tivals,</HI> days of religious fea&s;ting. Such &s;olemnities have obtained in every age and nation.&mdash;Fe&s;tivals among the ancient Grecians were in&s;tituted upon various accounts. Fir&s;t, in ho|nour of the gods, e&s;pecially if they had conferred any &s;ignal &s;a|vours on the public, or on private per&s;ons. Secondly, in order to procure &s;ome e&s;pecial favour from the gods; or to appea&s;e their anger, in times of public calamity. Thirdly, in memory of decea&s;ed friends, or of tho&s;e who had done any remarkable &s;ervice to, or died valiantly in defence of, their country. Fourthly, at a time of ea&s;e and re&s;t from their labour. In the ancient Chri&s;tian church, be&s;ides the fe&s;tivals, which peculiarly re|lated to our Lord's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">conomy on earth (&s;uch as the Nativity,
<PB REF="439">Ea&s;ter, Penteco&s;t, &amp;c.) there was another &s;ort in&s;tituted by the church, in honour of the apo&s;tles and martyrs. The fir&s;t ori|ginal of the&s;e fe&s;tivals is not certainly known, but learned men commonly carry it as high as the &s;econd century. The&s;e they called their natalitia or birth-days, meaning not their natural birth, but a glorious crown in the kingdom of Heaven. They were celebrated at the graves or monuments of the martyrs, and were mo&s;tly confined to tho&s;e particular churches where the mar|tyrs lay buried; for which rea&s;on it was cu&s;tomary for every church to have its particular fa&s;ti or kalendar of martyrs, in which was a di&s;tinct narrative of the acts and &s;ufferings of each martyr, and the&s;e acts and &s;ufferings were commonly read in the church on the anniver&s;ary, commemoration and proper fe&s;tival of the martyr. To the&s;e they commonly added a panegyrical oration, or &s;ermon, on the virtue of the martyr. They ob&s;erved the virgil or eve of the&s;e fe&s;tivals, with p&s;almody and prayer, till break of day.&mdash;Another &s;ort of fe&s;tivals, ob&s;erved by the ancient Chri&s;ti|ans, were annual thank&s;giving days, for favours and ble&s;&s;ings vouch&s;afed by God to his church. Thus the church of Alexan|dria kept an anniver&s;ary thank&s;giving on the twenty-fir&s;t of Ju|ly, for their deliverance from a terrible earthquake, in the reign of Julian; among the&s;e we may reckon the thank&s;givings for &s;ignal victories of the Emperors, which generally la&s;ted no long|er than the life of the Emperor on who&s;e account they were in|&s;tituted.&mdash;In the Romi&s;h church, there are double fea&s;ts, half double, and &s;imple fea&s;ts. The name of double fea&s;ts was given to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ervice is fuller and more &s;olemn than the re&s;t; the other denominations took their ri&s;e from &s;ingular rea&s;ons, the chief difference between them being the greater or le&s;s &s;olemnity u&s;ed in them. The churches are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the altars a|dorned according to the rank each &s;aint holds in his re&s;pective church; all high fe&s;tivals have an octave, con&s;i&s;ting of the fea&s;t it&s;elf, and the &s;even following days.&mdash;In Italy, certain fe&s;tivals are celebrated which occur only in the kalendar of the lovers of that country: to under&s;tand this, you are to know, that when a lover is de&s;irous of giving his mi&s;tre&s;s the highe&s;t te&s;timonies of his gallantry, he immediately makes her the idol of his devotion; he has ve&s;pers, and even ma&s;&s;es &s;aid in her honour: for this pur|po&s;e he makes choice of &s;ome &s;aint who&s;e name &s;he bears, and, tho' the &s;aint has the name, they manage matters &s;o, that the de|votion of the fe&s;tival is plainly relative to the lover's mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash; When, upon the reformation, the liturgy of the church of Eng|land was &s;ettled, the ob&s;ervation of fe&s;tivals was enjoined by &s;e|veral &s;tatutes, which were revived in the fir&s;t year of Queen Eli|zabeth, and continued in the fir&s;t year of King James; and when, upon the re&s;toration, King Charles i&s;&s;ued out a commi&s;&s;ion for re|viving the liturgy, the alterations made in it were &s;ynodically a|greed

It is ob&s;erved the Thur&s;|day after the octaves of Whit&s;untide; its in&s;titution is a&s;cribed to Pope Urban IV. in the year 1264; the office for the &s;olemnity was drawn up by the famous Thomas Aquinas, the church being at that time di&s;turbed by the faction of the Guel&s;s and Gibolines. Pope Urban's bull for this fe&s;tival was not every where obeyed. Afterwards, at the general council of Vienne, in 1311, under Pope Clement V. the Kings of England, France, and Arragon, be|ing pre&s;ent, this bull was confirmed, and ordered to be every where ob&s;erved.

St. Irenaeus &s;uppo&s;es that St. Paul greatly reflects upon this &s;ectary in his epi&s;tle to Timothy, which may be the rea&s;on why the&s;e epi&s;tles were in after-time rejected by them. Some imagine they proceeded from Simon Magus, and from this root they branched into various other &s;ects, as Valentinians, Cerin|thians, Ba&s;ilidians, Marcienites, Colobar&s;ian, &amp;c. One thing, in ju&s;tice to truth, is ob&s;ervable, and whoever impartially examines the fathers portraiture of the&s;e ancient here&s;ies, will find there the fir&s;t &s;eeds and elements of tho&s;e controver&s;ies which &s;o much di&s;|turbed the peace of the church for &s;everal centuries: and indeed it could be wi&s;hed the chief patrons of &s;ome doctrines, which our fir&s;t reformers either &s;tarted them&s;elves, or brought with them out of the Romi&s;h church, would carefully examine St. Irenaeus, were it only to &s;ee under what cla&s;s that ancient writer would have ran|ged them, whether within the pale of the primitive church, or among the errors which &s;he unanimou&s;ly exploded; and indeed I mu&s;t refer the reader to that author for a full account of them. Their principal tenets are, fir&s;t, the notion of the <HI>probolae,</HI> or in|ternal productions, by which they meant &s;omething originally re|&s;iding within the e&s;&s;ence of God, and formed by him into a di&s;|tinct per&s;onal &s;ub&s;tance from him; a doctrine not only incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity and immutability of the divine nature, but which al&s;o is attended with this manife&s;t contradiction, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;uppo&s;ing one and the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence to be both derived and unde|rived, &s;elf-exi&s;tent and begotten. Anaximander (&s;ays this ancient father, and meaning the Pagan philo&s;opher &s;o called) affirmed that which is immen&s;e to be the father of all things, containing, after a &s;eminal manner, within him&s;elf the production of all. This notion they have borrowed from him, and applied to their <HI>Bithus</HI> or <HI>Aeons,</HI> i. e. to their &s;upreme Father, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of divine per&s;onages derived from him; and, on the &s;ame principle, they attempted to explain the production of the animal and ma|terial world, not by God's creating it out of nothing, for this Valentinius denied, but by &s;ome flux or emanation of &s;ub&s;tance or pa&s;&s;ion from one of their Aeons. In much the &s;ame way they accounted for the origin of moral good and evil, not by founding them wholly on the will of the free agent, but in his &s;ub&s;tance or nature, made up (it &s;eems) of certain qualities originally im|planted in him, qualities in which his own con&s;ent and will was not the lea&s;t concerned, as being coeval with his exi&s;tence, and, as I before ob&s;erved, interwoven with his very nature. From hence came the <HI>Co&s;mocrater</HI> or diabolic power, and (to u&s;e their phra&s;eology) the whole &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance of wickedne&s;s: and from hence, 3dly, de&s;cending lower (I mean to the human &s;pe|cies) they divided it into the material, animal, and &s;piritual.

The &s;econd were candidates for happine&s;s, and were trained up for it by faith and good works; and under this divi&s;ion, &s;ays Irenaeus, they place us who are of the church; for which rea&s;on, they &s;ay, a good life or practice is nece&s;&s;ary for us ab&s;olutely &s;o; but as for them&s;elves, that they &s;hall be &s;aved, not by practice, but being by nature &s;piritual, and having the &s;eeds of election. They a&s;&s;ert in relation to our Saviour, that he a&s;|&s;umed the fir&s;t-fruits of whatever he intended to &s;ave.

<ITEM><HI>God.</HI> So we call the Supreme Being, the fir&s;t cau&s;e or Creator of the univer&s;e, and the only true object of religious wor&s;hip. "God (&s;ays Sir I&s;aac Newton) is a relative term, and has re&s;pect to &s;er|vants. It denotes indeed an eternal, infinite, ab&s;olutely perfect being; but &s;uch a being, without dominion, would not be God. The word God frequently &s;ignifies Lord, but every Lord is not God. The dominion of a &s;piritual being, or Lord, con&s;titutes God, true dominion, true God, the &s;upreme &s;upreme, pretended pretended. From &s;uch true dominion it follows, that the true God is living, intelligent, and powerful; and from his other per|fections, that he is &s;upreme, or &s;upremely perfect. He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omni&s;cient; that is, he endures from eternity to eternity, and is pre&s;ent from infinity to infinity; he governs all things that exi&s;t, and knows all things that are to be known; he is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; he is not duration of &s;pace, but he endures and is pre&s;ent; he en|dures always, and is pre&s;ent every where; and by exi&s;ting al|ways and every where, con&s;titutes the very things we call dura|tion and &s;pace, eternity and infinity: he is omnipre&s;ent, not on|ly virtually, but &s;ub&s;tantially; for power without &s;ub&s;tance can|not

All things are contained, and more in him, but without any mutual pa&s;&s;ion; that is, he &s;uffers nothing from the motion of bodies, nor do they undergo any re&s;i&s;tance from his omnipre&s;ence. It is confe&s;&s;ed, that God exi&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily, and by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity he exi&s;ts always and every where. Hence he mu&s;t be always &s;imilar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all perception, intelligence, and action; but after a manner not at all corporeal, not at all like men, after a manner altogether unknown to us. He is de&s;titute of all body and bodily &s;hape, and therefore cannot be &s;een, heard, or touched, nor ought to be wor&s;hipped under the repre&s;entation of any thing corporeal. We know him only by his properties or attributes, by the mo&s;t wi&s;e and excellent &s;tructure of things, and by final cau&s;es; but we adore and wor&s;hip him only on account of his dominion; for God, &s;etting a&s;ide dominion, providence, and final cau&s;es, is nothing el&s;e but fate and nature."&mdash;The exi&s;tence of &s;uch a being, or fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, is thus beautifully proved and illu&s;|trated by the ingenious author of The Religion of Nature deli|neated. "Suppo&s;e a chain hung out of the heavens from an un|known height, and though every link of it gravitated towards the earth, and what it hung upon was not vi&s;ible, yet it did not de|&s;cend, but kept its &s;ituation; and upon this a que&s;tion &s;hould a|ri&s;e, what &s;upported or kept up this chain? would it be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that the fir&s;t or lowe&s;t link hung upon the &s;econd, or that next above; the &s;econd, or rather the fir&s;t and &s;econd toge|ther, on the third, and &s;o on <HI>ad infinitum?</HI> For what holds up the whole? A chain of ten links would fall down, unle&s;s &s;ome|thing able to bear it hindered; one of twenty, if not &s;taid by &s;ome|thing of yet greater &s;trength, in proportion to the increa&s;e of weight; and therefore one of infinite links certainly, if not &s;u&s;|tained by &s;omething infinitely &s;trong, and capable to bear an infi|nite weight.

<ITEM><PB REF="448"><HI>Heretics,</HI> the general name of &s;uch per&s;ons under any religion, but e|&s;pecially the Chri&s;tian, as maintain or teach opinions in religion con|trary to the orthodox, or e&s;tabli&s;hed faith. The term here&s;y is of Greek original, and &s;ignifies option, choice, or &s;ect, as is ap|plied to the voluntary choice a man makes of doctrines, &s;uppo&s;ed to be contrary to the true faith. Here&s;ies began very early in the Chri&s;tian church: Eu&s;ebius fixes the beginning of mo&s;t of them to the reign of the Emperor Adrian; and yet it is certain, that Simon Magus had publi&s;hed his errors before that time, and &s;et up a &s;ect, which gave ri&s;e to mo&s;t of the ancient here&s;ies. The laws both of the church and &s;tate were very &s;evere again&s;t tho&s;e who were adjudged to be heretics. Tho&s;e of the &s;tates, made by the Chri&s;tian Emperors from the time of Con&s;tantine, are com|pri&s;ed under one title, <HI>De Hereticis,</HI> in the Theodo&s;ian Code. The principal of them are, fir&s;t, the general note of infamy affix|ed to all heretics in common. Secondry, all commerce forbidden to be held with them. Thirdly, the depriving them of all offices of profit and dignity. Fourthly, the di&s;qualifying them to di&s;|po&s;e of their e&s;tates, by will, or receive e&s;tates from others. Fifth|ly, the impo&s;ing on them pecuniary mulcts. Sixth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, the pro&s;cri|bing and bani&s;hing them. Seventhly, the inflicting corporal puni&s;hment on them, &s;uch as &s;cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, &amp;c. before bani&s;hment. Be&s;ides the&s;e laws, which chiefly affected the per&s;ons of heretics, there were &s;everal others which tended to the extirpation of here&s;y; &s;uch as, fir&s;t tho&s;e which forbad heretical teachers to propagate their doctrines publickly or privately. Secondly, tho&s;e which forbad heretics to hold public di&s;putations. Thirdly, &s;uch laws as pro|hibited all heretical meetings and a&s;&s;emblies. Thirdly, tho&s;e which deny to the children of heretical parents their patrimony and inheritance, unle&s;s they returned to the church: and, fourth|ly, &s;uch laws as ordered the books of heretics to be burned. There were many other penal laws made again&s;t heretics, from the time of Con&s;tantine to Theodo&s;ius, jun. and Valentinian III. but the few already mentioned, may be &s;ufficient to give an idea of the rigour with which the empire treated &s;uch per&s;ons, as held, or taught opinions contrary to the faith of the Catholic church; who&s;e di&s;cipline towards heretics was no le&s;s &s;evere than the civil laws. For, fir&s;t, the church was u&s;ed to pronounce a formal ana|thema, or excommunication, again&s;t them. Thus the council of Nice ends her creed with an anathema again&s;t all tho&s;e who op|po&s;ed the doctrine there delivered, and there are innumerable in|&s;tances of this kind to be found in the volumes of the councils. Secondly, &s;ome canons debarred them from the very lowe&s;t pri|vileges of church-communion, forbidding them to enter into the church, &s;o much as to hear the &s;ermon, or the &s;criptures read in the &s;ervice of the catechumens: but this was no general rule, for liberty was often granted to heretics to be pre&s;ent at the &s;ermons, in hopes of their conver&s;ion; and the hi&s;torians tell us, that
<PB REF="449">Chry&s;o&s;tom, by this means, brought over many to acknowledge the divinity of Chri&s;t, whil&s;t they had liberty to come and hear his &s;ermons. Thirdly, the church prohibited all per&s;ons, under pain of excommunication, to join with heretics in any religious offices. Fourthly, by the laws of the church, no one was to eat or conver&s;e familiarly with heretics, or to read their writings, or to contract affinity with them; their names were to be &s;truck out of the Diptyches, or &s;acred regi&s;ters of the church; and, if they died in here&s;y, no p&s;almody, or other &s;olemnity, was to be u&s;ed at their funerals. Fifthly, the te&s;timony of heretics was notto be taken in any eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;e what&s;oever. The&s;e are the chief eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws again&s;t heretics. As to the terms of penance impo&s;ed upon relenting heretics, or &s;uch as were willing to re|nounce their errors, and to be reconciled to the church, they were various, and differed according to the canons of different councils, or the u&s;age of different churches. The council of Eliberis appoints ten years penance before repenting heretics are admitted to communion. The council of Agde contracted this term into that of three years. The council of Epone reduced it to two years only. The ancient Chri&s;tian church made a di&s;tinction be|tween &s;uch heretics as contumaciou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted the admonitions of the church, and &s;uch as never had any admonition given them; for none were reputed formal heretics, or treated as &s;uch, till the church had given them a fir&s;t and &s;econd admonition, according to the Apo&s;tles rule. The Romi&s;h church is very rigorous in her treatment of tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom &s;he deems to be heretics, par|ticularly in tho&s;e countries where the inqui&s;ition prevails. There the utmo&s;t &s;everities of impri&s;onment, racks, and tortures of va|rious &s;hapes, are employed again&s;t them; and if the civil magi&s;trate, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they implore when the puni&s;hment is capital, &s;hould go about to mitigate it, he him&s;elf would be &s;u&s;pected of favouring heretics, and would run the ri&s;k of excommunication. There is no expre&s;s law in England, which determines what &s;hall be called here&s;y. It is true, the &s;tatute 1 Elizabeth, cap. i. di|rected the high commi&s;&s;ion court to re&s;train the &s;ame, to what had been adjudged to be &s;o by the authority of the &s;criptures, or by the fir&s;t four general councils, or to what &s;hould be determined to be &s;uch by parliament, the convocation a&s;&s;enting. The Arch|bi&s;hop, or Bi&s;hop of any dioce&s;e, has, by the common law, power to convict per&s;ons of here&s;y: the convocation may declare what tenets are heretical. Here&s;y was, anciently, trea&s;on; and the puni&s;hment for it was burning, by virtue of the writ, <HI>De here|tico comburendo;</HI> but the heretic forfeited neither lands nor goods, becau&s;e the proceedings again&s;t him were <HI>pro &s;alute animi.</HI> By &s;tatute 29 Car. II. cap. ix. the proceedings on &s;uch writ, and all puni&s;hments by death, in pur&s;uance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, are taken away; but an ob&s;tinate heretic, being excommunicated, is liable to be impri&s;oned by virtue of the writ <HI>de excommunicatio

Tho&s;e, &s;ays St. Jerom, who interpret &s;cripture to any &s;en&s;e repugnant to that of the Holy Spirit, tho' they &s;hould never withdraw them&s;elves from the church, yet may be ju&s;tly called heretics.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Jacobites,</HI> a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians in Syria and Me&s;opotamia, &s;o called, either from one Jacob, a Syrian, who lived in the time of the Emperor Mauricius, or from one Jacob a Monk, firnamed Zan|zales, who flouri&s;hed in 550. The Jacobites are one of the two &s;ects which &s;prung from the followers of Dio&s;corus and Eutyches, who refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the council of Chalcedon. They are divided among them&s;elves, &s;ome following the rites of the Latin church, and others continuing &s;eparated from the church of Rome. There is al&s;o at pre&s;ent a divi&s;ion among the latter, who have two rival Patriarchs, one of whom re&s;ides at Caramit, and the other at Derizapharan. As to their belief, they are Monophy&s;ites; that is, they hold but one nature in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which was the &s;entiment of Dio&s;corus. They pretend, however, that they ex|plain them&s;elves in this manner concerning the union of nature and per&s;on in Chri&s;t, only to keep at a di&s;tance from the Ne&s;to|riaus, but that in effect they do not differ far from the church of Rome, which e&s;tabli&s;hes two natures in Chri&s;t. With re&s;pect to purgatory, and prayers for the dead, they are of the &s;ame opinion with the Greeks, and the other Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians. They con&s;e|crate the euchari&s;t with leavened bread; they neglect confe&s;&s;ion, believing it not to be of divine in&s;titution.

Some commands of God are impo&s;&s;ible to righteous men, even tho' they endeavour with all their powers to accompli&s;h them, the grace being wanted by which they &s;hould be able to perform them. II. In the &s;tate of corrupted nature, a man never re&s;i&s;ts inward grace. III.

They followed the rule of St. Augu&s;tine, and were rank|ed among the order of Mendicants. For two centuries they were mere lay-brothers; but, in 1606, Paul V. gave them leave to enter into holy orders.

<ITEM><PB REF="453"><HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> a mo&s;t famous religious order in the Romi&s;h church. Their founder was Inigo or Ignatius Loyola, who was born, in 1491, in the province of Guipu&s;coa, in Spain. He was bred up in the court of Ferdinand, King of Spain. In his youth he di&s;covered a martial di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;iege of Pam|pelona, where he was wounded, and taken pri&s;oner by the French. During his confinement and illne&s;s, he read &s;ome books of piety, which occa&s;ioned his fir&s;t re&s;olution of devoting him&s;elf wholly to God. As &s;oon as he was cured, he undertook a pil|grimage to our Lady of Mont&s;errat in Catalonia, where he dedi|cated him&s;elf to the Virgin, and took a re&s;olution to travel to Je|ru&s;alem. It is believed he here wrote his Spiritual Exerci&s;es, which he afterwards publi&s;hed at Rome in 1548. He arrived at Jeru&s;alem, Sept. 4, 1523, where he vi&s;ited the holy places, and performed all the pious exerci&s;es of a pilgrim. Being returned to Spain, he began to &s;tudy grammar at Barcelona, and after|wards went through his cour&s;es of philo&s;ophy and divinity at Al|cala. Ignatius had then four companions, who were all cloathed like him&s;elf in a brown woollen habit, and applied them&s;elves to the &s;ame exerci&s;es. His &s;ame increa&s;ing, the number of tho&s;e who came to hear his in&s;tructions increa&s;ed likewi&s;e. This giv|ing umbrage to the inqui&s;itors of the city of Alcala, he was taken up, and impri&s;oned, by order of the Grand Vicar, but was &s;oon relea&s;ed, with an injunction to go cloathed like the other &s;cho|lars, and to ab&s;tain from talking to the people concerning reli|gion, till he had &s;tudied four years in divinity. Upon this he re|tired to Salamanca, where he continued to di&s;cour&s;e both in pub|lic and private upon moral &s;ubjects. Here he was again impri&s;on|ed, upon an information of the Dominicans again&s;t him. He being relea&s;ed, re&s;olved to quit Spain, and to go to Paris, with a firm re&s;olution to apply him&s;elf clo&s;ely to &s;tudy in that city. In 1538, Ignatius having a&s;&s;embled ten of his companions at Rome, cho&s;en mo&s;tly out of the univer&s;ity of Paris, propo&s;ed to them to make a new order. Paul III. confirmed the plan of his in&s;titu|tion by a bull, in 1540, calling them therein <HI>the company of Je|&s;us.</HI> The order was confirmed by &s;everal &s;ucceeding Popes, who added many new rights and privileges to it. The end principally propo&s;ed by this order is, to gain converts to the Romi&s;h church, with which view they di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in every country and nation, and, with amazing indu&s;try and addre&s;s, pur&s;ue the ends of their in&s;titution. No difficulty &s;o great that they cannot &s;ur|mount, no danger &s;o imminent that they will not undergo, and, as has been apparent, no crimes &s;o &s;hocking that have not been perpetrated by them, for the &s;ervice of their cau&s;es. They have been very con&s;picuous by their mi&s;&s;ions into the Indies, and by their other employments relating to the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences and the education of youth. They have lately, however, from the

They are al&s;o the names of a &s;ect of heretics, who &s;prung up in Spain a|bout the year 1575.

<ITEM><HI>Infinity,</HI> an attribute of God. "The idea of infinity or immen&s;ity is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with that of &s;elf-exi&s;tence, that, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;omething mu&s;t be infinite, independently, and of it&s;elf, therefore it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;elf exi&s;tent; and be|cau&s;e &s;omething mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;elf-exi&s;tent, therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be infinite. A nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tent being mu&s;t be every where, as well as always, unalterably the &s;ame; for a nece&s;&s;ity which is not every where the &s;ame, is plainly a con&s;equential nece&s;&s;ity only, depending upon &s;ome ex|ternal cau&s;e. Whatever therefore exi&s;ts by an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in its own nature, mu&s;t needs be infinite, as well as eternal. To &s;uppo&s;e a finite being to be &s;elf-exi&s;tent, is to &s;ay, that it is a con|tradiction for that being not to exi&s;t, the ab&s;ence of which may yet be conceived, without a contradiction, which is the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity in the world. From hence it follows, that the infinity of the &s;elf-exi&s;tent being mu&s;t be an infinity of fulne&s;s, as well as of immen&s;ity; that is, it mu&s;t not only be without limits, but al&s;o without diver&s;ity, defect, or interruption. It follows likewi&s;e, that the &s;elf-exi&s;tent being mu&s;t be a mo&s;t &s;imple, un|changeable, incorruptible being, without parts, figure, motion, divi&s;ibility, or any other &s;uch properties as we find in matter; for all the&s;e things do plainly and nece&s;&s;arily imply finitene&s;s in their very notion, and are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with compleat in|finity. As to the particular manner in which the Supreme Being is infinite, or every where pre&s;ent, this is as impo&s;&s;ible for our finite under&s;tandings to comprehend and explain, as it is for us to form an adequate idea of infinity. The &s;choolmen have pre|&s;umed to a&s;&s;ert, that the immen&s;ity of God is a point, as his eternity (they think) is an in&s;iance. But this being altogether unintelligible, we may more &s;afely affirm, that the &s;upreme cau&s;e is at all times equally pre&s;ent, both in his &s;imple e&s;&s;ence, and by the immediate and perfect exerci&s;e of all his attributes, to every point of the boundle&s;s immen&s;ity, as if it were really all but one &s;ingle point.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Legate,</HI> in Latin <HI>legatus,</HI> a Cardinal, or Bi&s;hop, whom the Pope &s;ends as his amba&s;&s;ador to &s;overeign Princes. There are three kinds of legates, <HI>viz.</HI> legates <HI>&agrave; latere,</HI> legates <HI>de latere,</HI> and le|gates by office, or <HI>legati nati.</HI> Of the&s;e the mo&s;t confiderable are legates <HI>&agrave; latere;</HI> &s;uch are tho&s;e whom the Pope commi&s;&s;ions to take his place in councils, &s;o called, in regard that the Pope ne|ver gives this office to any but his favourites and confidents, who are always at his &s;ide, <HI>&agrave; latere.</HI> The&s;e are u&s;ually Cardinals. A legate <HI>&agrave; latere</HI> has the power of conferring benefices without man|date, of legitimating ba&s;tards to hold offices, and has a cro&s;s car|ried before him, as the en&s;ign of his authority. The legates <HI>de latere</HI> are tho&s;e who are not Cardinals, but yet are in&s;tituted with an apo&s;tolical legation. Legates by office are tho&s;e who have not any particular legation given them, but who, by virtue of their dignity and rank in the church, become legates; &s;uch are the Archbi&s;hops of Rheims and Arles. But the authority of the&s;e le|gates is much inferior to that of the legates <HI>&agrave; latere.</HI> The power of a legate is &s;ometimes given without the title: &s;ome of the nuncio's are inve&s;ted with it. It was one of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical pri|vileges of England, from the Norman conque&s;t, that no foreign legate &s;hould be obtruded upon the Engli&s;h, unle&s;s the King &s;hould de&s;ire it upon &s;ome extraordinary emergency, as when a ca&s;e was too difficult for the Engli&s;h prelates to determine. Hence, in the reign of Henry II. when Cardinal Vivian, who was &s;ent legate into Scotland, Ireland, and Norway, arrived in England on his journey thither, the King &s;ent the Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Ely to a&s;k him by who&s;e authority the ventured into the kingdom

Lent was fir&s;t ob&s;erved in England by Ercumbert, &s;eventh King of Kent, A. D. 800. The Greek church ob&s;erve five Lents, the Jacobites the &s;ame number, and the Maronites &s;ix.</ITEM>

It has been often printed. This is a tran&s;lation of it. "There has appeared here a per&s;on, &s;till living, who&s;e name is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

There is &s;omething wonderfully charming in his face, with a mixture of gravity. He was never &s;een to laugh, but has been ob&s;erved to weep.

<ITEM><HI>Libertines, libertini,</HI> a religious fact which aro&s;e in the year 1525, who&s;e principal tenets were, that there is but one only Spirit, which is that of God, who is diffu&s;ed through all things, who is and lives in all creatures; that our &s;ouls are nothing but this &s;pi|rit of God; that the &s;oul dies with the body; that &s;in is a mere chimera, and only &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in opinion; &s;o that it is God that does all; both good and evil; that paradi&s;e is a dream, and hell a
<PB REF="459">phantom, invented by prie&s;ts, and religion a &s;tate-trick, to keep men in awe; that &s;piritual regeneration only con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tifling the remor&s;e of con&s;cience; repentance, in avowing to have done no evil; and that it is lawful, and even expedient, to di&s;&s;emble in matters of religion. To the&s;e they added horrid bla&s;phemies again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;aying he was nothing but a mere <HI>je ne &s;cai quoi,</HI> compo&s;ed of the &s;pirit of God, and of the opinion of men.

<ITEM><HI>Litany,</HI> in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, in Latin <HI>Supplicatio,</HI> and <HI>Rogatio.</HI> The word Litany, in its original meaning, is but another name for prayer in general, and is u&s;ed as &s;uch by Heathen authors. In the Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e of the word, a litany is a &s;olemn form of &s;up|plication to God. Eu&s;ebius, &s;peaking of Con&s;tantine's cu&s;tom of making &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es to God in his tent, &s;ays, he endeavour|ed to render God propitious to him by his &s;upplication and li|tanies; and Arcadius, in one of his laws again&s;t heretics, for|bids them to hold profane a&s;&s;emblies in the city, either by night or by day, to make their litany. At that time the public pray|ers, hymns, and p&s;almody, were all compri&s;ed under the general name of litany. Afterwards, the word came to &s;ignify a pecu|liar
<PB REF="460">&s;ort of prayers u&s;ed in the church, concerning the original of which learned men are not agreed. At fir&s;t the u&s;e of litanies was not fixed to any &s;tated time, but they were employed only as exigencies required. They were ob&s;erved, in imitation of the Ninevites, with ardent &s;upplications and fa&s;tings, to avert the threatening judgments of fire, earthquakes, inundations, or ho&s;|tile inva&s;ions. The days on which they were u&s;ed were called Rogation-days. Several of the&s;e days were appointed by the ca|nons of different councils, till the &s;eventeenth council of Toledo decreed, that litanies &s;hould be u&s;ed every month throughout the year; and &s;o, by degrees, the&s;e &s;olemn &s;upplications came to be u&s;ed weekly, on Wedne&s;days and Fridays, the ancient &s;tationary days in all churches. As to the form in which litanies are made, namely, in &s;hort petitions by the prie&s;t, which re&s;pon&s;es by the people, St. Chry&s;o&s;tom derives the cu&s;tom from the primitive ages, when the prie&s;t began and uttered by the Spirit &s;ome things fit to be prayed for, and the people joined the interce&s;&s;ions, &s;ay|ing, "We be&s;eech thee to hear us, good Lord." When the miraculous gifts of the Spirit began to cea&s;e, they wrote down &s;everal of the&s;e forms, which were the original of our modern li|tanies. St. Ambro&s;e has left us one, agreeing in many things with that of our own church. About the year 400, litanies be|gan to be u&s;ed in proce&s;&s;ions, the people walking barefoot, and repeating them with great devotion. It is pretended &s;everal countries were delivered from great calamities by this means. About the year 600, Gregory the Great, out of all the litanies extant, compo&s;ed the famous &s;even-fold litany, by which Rome, it is &s;aid, was delivered from a grievous mortality. This has been a pattern to all the we&s;tern churches &s;ince, to which ours of the church of England comes nearer than that in the pre&s;ent Ro|man Mi&s;&s;al, in which later Popes have in&s;erted the invocation of &s;aints, which our reformers ju&s;tly expunged. Tho&s;e proce&s;&s;ional liturgies having occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ioned much &s;candal, it was decreed, that the litanies for the future &s;hould only be u&s;ed within the walls of the church. The days appointed by the fifteenth canon of our church for u&s;ing the litany, are Wedne&s;days and Fridays, the ancient fa&s;ting-days of the primitive church, to which, by the &s;ubric, Sundays are added, as being the days of the greate&s;t a&s;|&s;embly for divine &s;ervice. Before the la&s;t review of the Common-Prayer, the litany was a di&s;tinct &s;ervice by it&s;elf, and u&s;ed &s;ome time after the morning-prayer was over. At pre&s;ent it is made one office with the morning-&s;ervice, being ordered to be read af|ter the third collect for grace, in&s;tead of the interce&s;&s;ional prayers in the daily &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Liturgy,</HI> denotes all the ceremonies in general belonging to divine &s;ervice. In a more re&s;trained &s;ignification, liturgy is u&s;ed among the Romani&s;ts, to &s;ignify the ma&s;s, and among us the Common-Prayer.
<PB REF="461">Prayer. All who have written on liturgies agree, that, in the primitive days, divine &s;ervice was exceedingly &s;imple, clogged with a very few ceremonies, and con&s;i&s;ting of but a &s;mall num|ber of prayers; but by degrees they increa&s;ed the number of ex|ternal ceremonies, and added new prayers, to make the office look more awful and venerable to the people. At length things were carried to &s;uch a pitch, that a regulation became nece&s;&s;ary, and it was found proper to put the &s;ervice, and the manner of per|forming it, into writing; and this was what they called a liturgy. Liturgies have been different at different times, and in different countries. We have the liturgy of St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, that of St. Peter, of St. James, the liturgy of St. Ba&s;il, the Armenian litur|gy, the liturgy of the Maronites, of the Cophtae, the Roman li|turgy, the Gallican liturgy, the Engli&s;h liturgy, the Ambro&s;ian liturgy, the Spani&s;h and African liturgies, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Liturgy of the church of England.</HI> This book is intitled, The Book of Common Prayer, and Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the U&s;e of the Church of England. Before the Reformation, the liturgy was only in Latin, being a collection of prayers, made up partly of &s;ome ancient forms u&s;ed in the primitive church, and partly of &s;ome others of a later original, accommodated to the Romi&s;h re|ligion, at that time the religion of England. But when the na|tion, in King Henry VIII.'s time, was di&s;po&s;ed to a reformation, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary both to have the &s;ervice in the Engli&s;h or vulgar tongue, and to correct and amend the liturgy, by pur|ging it of tho&s;e gro&s;s corruptions which had gradually crept into it. And, fir&s;t, the convocation appointed a committee, A. D. 1537, to compo&s;e a book, which was intitled, The godly and pious In|&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man, containing a Declaration of the Lord's Prayer, the <HI>Ave Maria,</HI> the Creed, the Ten Command|ments, and the Seven Sacraments, &amp;c. This book was again publi&s;hed in 1540, with corrections and alterations, under the title of, A nece&s;&s;ary Erudition of any Chry&s;ten Man. In the &s;ame year, a committee of Bi&s;hops and other divines was ap|pointed by King Henry VIII. to reform the rituals and offices of the church, and the next year the King and clergy ordered the prayers for proce&s;&s;ions and litanies to be put in Engli&s;h, and to be publickly u&s;ed. Afterwards, in 1545, came out the King's primer, containing the whole morning and evening prayer in Eng|li&s;h, not very different from what it is in pre&s;ent from our Com|mon Prayer. Thus far the reformation of our liturgy was carried in the reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;In the year 1547, the fir&s;t of King Edward VI. the convocation unanimou&s;ly declared, that the com|munion ought to be admini&s;tered in both kinds; whereupon an act of parliament was made, ordering it to be admini&s;tered; then a committee of Bi&s;hops, and other learned divines, was ap|pointed
<PB REF="462">to compo&s;e an uniform order of communion, according to the rules of &s;cripture, and the u&s;e of the primitive church. The committee accordingly met in Wind&s;or ca&s;tle, and drew up &s;uch a form. This made way for a new commi&s;&s;ion, impower|ing the &s;ame per&s;ons to fini&s;h the whole liturgy, by drawing up public offices for Sundays and holydays, for the bapti&s;m, confir|mation, matrimony, burial, and other &s;pecial occa&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lollards.</HI> This &s;ect, &s;pread throughout Germany, had for their lead|er Walter Lollard, who began to di&s;per&s;e his opinions about the year 1315.

<ITEM><HI>Love</HI> (the family of) a &s;ect of enthu&s;ia&s;ts which aro&s;e in Holland, and being propagated cro&s;s the Channel, appeared in England about the year 1580.

In order to propagate their opinions, they di&s;per&s;ed books tran&s;lated out of Dutch into Engli&s;h, intitled, The Go&s;pel of the Kingdom, Documental Sen|tences, The Prophecy of the Spirit of Love, The publi&s;hing of

<ITEM><HI>Manichees,</HI> Manicheans, or Manichoei, a &s;ect of ancient heretics, who a&s;&s;erted two principles, &s;o called from their author Manes, or Manicheus, a Per&s;ian by nation. He e&s;tabli&s;hed two princi|ples, viz. a good one and an evil one. The fir&s;t, which he called light, did nothing but good; and the &s;econd, which he called darkne&s;s, nothing but evil. This philo&s;ophy is very ancient, and Plutarch treats of it at large in his I&s;is and O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iris. Our &s;ouls, ac|cording to Manes, were made by the good principle, and our bodies by the evil one; the&s;e two principles being co-e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nal and independent of each other. He borrowed many things from the ancient Gno&s;tics, on which account many authors confider the Manicheans as a branch of the Gno&s;tics. In truth, the Manichean doctrine was a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, rather than of religion. They made u&s;e of amulets, in imitation of the Ba&s;ilidians, and are &s;aid to have made profe&s;&s;ion of a&s;tronomy and a&s;trology. They denied that Je&s;us Chri&s;t a&s;&s;umed a true human body, and main|tained it was only imagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary. They pretended that the law of Mo&s;es did not come from God, or the good principle, but from the evil one; and for this rea&s;on it was abrogated. They ab|&s;tained entirely from eating the fle&s;h of any animal, following herein the doctrine of the ancient Phythagore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. The re&s;t of their errors may be &s;een in St. Epiphanius, and St. Augu&s;tine; which la&s;t having been of their &s;ect, may be pre&s;umed to have been thoroughly acquainted with them. Though the Manichees profe&s;&s;ed to receive the books of the New Te&s;tament; yet, in ef|fect, they only took &s;o much of them as &s;uited with their opinions. They fir&s;t formed to them&s;elves a certain idea, or &s;cheme of Chri&s;|tianity, and to this adju&s;ted the writings of the Apo&s;tles; pretend|ing, that whatever was incon&s;i&s;tent with this, had been foi&s;ted in the New Te&s;tament by latter writers, who were half Jews. On the other hand, they made fables, and apocryphal books, pa&s;s for apo&s;tolical writings; and even are &s;u&s;pected to have forged &s;everal others, the better to maintain their errors. St. Epiphanius gives a catalogue of &s;everal pieces, publi&s;hed by Manes, and adds extracts front &s;ome of them. Manes was not contented with the quality of Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but al&s;o a&s;&s;umed that of the
<PB REF="465">Paraclete, whom Chri&s;t had promi&s;ed to &s;end. He left &s;everal di&s;ciples, and among others Addas, Thomas, and Hermas. The&s;e he &s;ent in his lifetime into &s;everal provinces, to preach his doc|trine. Manes having undertaken to cure the King of Per&s;ia's &s;on, and not &s;ucceeding, was clapped into pri&s;on upon the young Prince's death, whence he made his e&s;cape; but was apprehended &s;oon after, and burnt alive. Towards the middle of the 12th century the &s;ect of Manichees took a new face, on occa&s;ion of one Con&s;tantine, an Armenian, and adherer to it, who took upon him to &s;uppre&s;s the reading of all other books, be&s;ides the evan|geli&s;ts and the epi&s;tles of St. Paul, which he explained in &s;uch a manner, as to make them contain a new &s;y&s;tem of Manichei&s;m. He entirely di&s;carded all the writings of his predece&s;&s;ors, rejected the chimeras of the Valentinians and their thirty Aeons, the fable of Manes, with regard to the origin of rain, which he made to be the &s;weat of a young man in hot pur&s;uit after a maid, and other dreams; but &s;till retained the impurities of Ba&s;ilides. In this manner he reformed Manichei&s;m, in&s;omuch that his followers made no &s;cruple of anathematizing Scythian Buldas, and even Manes him&s;elf, Con&s;tantine being now their great Apo&s;tle. After he had &s;educed an infinite number of people, he was at la&s;t &s;toned by order of the Emperor.</ITEM>

He taught two Chri&s;ts, one &s;ent for the &s;alvation of all the world, and an|other whom the Creator would &s;end to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Jews. He denied the re&s;urrection of the body, and allowed none to be bap|ti&s;ed but tho&s;e who pre&s;erved their continence; but the&s;e he granted might be bapti&s;ed three times, and held other &s;trange opinions.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Marriage,</HI> a contract, both civil and religious, between a man and a woman, by which they engage to live together in mutual love and friend&s;hip for the procreation of children, &amp;c. This has too near a connexion with religion to be omitted in this place. The fir&s;t inhabitants of Greece lived promi&s;cuou&s;ly without marriage. Ci|crops, King of Athens, was the fir&s;t author of this honourable in|&s;titution among that people. This is mentioned by the poet Nonnos. The Jews had their nuptial contracts and ceremonies. The pre&s;ent form among the Jews, which appears to be very an|cient, is very &s;imple and &s;ignificant. Though our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our had encouraged the in&s;titution of marriage by his own pre|&s;ence at a wedding fea&s;t, and St. Paul has declared, that marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled; yet there wanted not men in the fir&s;t ages of the Chri&s;tian church, who departed from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits, and doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry; and others who taught men to commit for|nication with licence and impunity. The ancient Chri&s;tian church laid &s;everal re&s;traints upon her members in relation to marriage: &s;uch were the rules forbidding Chri&s;tians to marry with Infidels and Heathens; this re&s;traint they founded upon the Apo&s;tle's words: "Who leaves a widow at liberty to marry whom &s;he will, only in the Lord," 1 Cor. vii. 39. And upon this precept of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle: "Be ye not unequally y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed with unbelievers," 2 Cor. vi. 24. This re&s;triction extended likewi&s;e to Jews, He|retics, and all per&s;ons of different per&s;ua&s;ions, with whom it was unlawful for an orthodox Chri&s;tian to be j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined in wedlock. An|other re&s;traint of the church laid on per&s;ons intending to marry, related to con&s;anguinity and affinity, which would have made the marriage ince&s;tuous, by coming within the degrees prohibited by God in &s;cripture. A third re&s;triction in this matter was, that children under age &s;hould not marry without the con&s;ent of their parents, guardians, and next relations. The Romi&s;h church has advanced marriage to the dignity of a &s;acrament. The ritual tells
<PB REF="467">us, that the end of the &s;acrament of marriage is, that man and wife may mutually help and comfort each other, in order that they may &s;pend this life in a holy manner, and thereby gain a ble&s;&s;ed immortality; and to contribute to the edification of the church, by the lawful procreation of children, and by the care of pro|curing them a &s;piritual regeneration, and an education &s;uitable to it. They require that every per&s;on, before he enters into wed|lock, be&s;eech God to join him with &s;uch a per&s;on as he may work out his &s;alvation with, and examine whether or no the per|&s;on he has fixed his affections on has the fear of God before her eyes, is prudent, di&s;creet, and able to take care of a family, &amp;c. In our church, the form and manner of marriage is too well known to need mention.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Places, high.</HI> The people of I&s;rael are frequently reproached in &s;cripture for wor&s;hipping upon high places.

Upon the&s;e eminences the &s;uper&s;titious I&s;raelites often adored idols, and committed a thou&s;and abominations in groves and caves. This inflamed the zeal of &s;everal pious Kings and prophets to &s;uppre&s;s and de&s;troy the high places. But there was another rea&s;on why it was not lawful to wor&s;hip even the true God on the&s;e hills, namely, be|cau&s;e the Temple being built, and the place prepared for the fixed &s;ettlement of the ark, it was no longer allowed to &s;acrifice out of Jeru&s;alem.

In this &s;tate it no longer needs prayers, or hymns, or vows; prayers where the Spirit labours, and the mouth opens, are the lot of the weak and the imperfect; the &s;oul of the &s;aint is, as it were, laid in the bo&s;om, and between the arms of its God; where, without making any motion, or exerting any action, it waits and receives the divine grace.

<P>THUS having given a full account, not only of the pure and undefiled religion in&s;tituted by the Redeemer of mankind, but al&s;o of the various &s;ects and parties which have ari&s;en in the Chri&s;tian church, from &s;uperadding to, or ab&s;tracting from, or er|roneou&s;ly under&s;tanding or interpreting the &s;criptures, on the one hand, or from &s;uper&s;tition or fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic enthu&s;ia&s;m on the other, many readers (before not much ver&s;ed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e matter.) may be apt to think lightly of religion it&s;elf, from the weakne&s;s or knavery of its profe&s;&s;ors, and conceive an opinion, that &s;criptures &s;o indeter|minate, and capable of &s;uch various &s;en&s;es, are not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e depend|ed upon as the rule of faith and practice, and the guide to eternal &s;alvation. To &s;uch I would addre&s;s the few following words.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the &s;everal religious parties in the world, there is &s;uch a thing as true religion, ab&s;tracted from the con&s;ideration of all tho&s;e parties, and which the &s;en&s;ible and virtuous part of mankind are of, con&s;i&s;ting in a reverential regard to the Supreme Being, and in &s;eeking, by the practice of virtue, to &s;ecure his approbation in this &s;tate, and in any future &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The excellent faculties and powers men are endued with, the va&s;t improvements they are capable of, and the de&s;ire, if they are
<PB REF="483">virtuous, and apprehen&s;ions, if vicious, of an hereafter, &s;eem, at lea&s;t, to be &s;trong pre&s;umptions of &s;uch a &s;tate: and certainly, if there may be a future &s;tate, and much more if it be probable there will, we ought to have a regard to it in our actions and conduct in this life. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, where vice and bigotry &s;eem al|mo&s;t to divide the world between them, a wi&s;e man will take care that he be neither irreligious or profane on the one hand, nor a bi|got or enthu&s;ia&s;t on the other. Among the &s;everal &s;orts of what are called revelations, I am a&s;&s;ured you will find the Chri&s;tian to be mo&s;t agreeable to rea&s;on and the nature of things, and, if rightly under&s;tood, to be a mo&s;t perfect repre&s;entation of all moral virtues. I advi&s;e you therefore to cultivate a veneration for the writings wherein it is contained, and for its divine Author. Difference of &s;tile, difference of cu&s;toms, and the different tenets of mankind, in different ages and countries, may, as you have &s;een, together with &s;ome corruptions and interpolations, have occa&s;ioned much ob&s;curity to us in &s;everal parts of the&s;e books; but all the rules of a good life and virtuous conduct are &s;ufficiently plain and intelligible. Public wor&s;hip, if for the good of mankind in general, as we know it is, ought to be kept up, though the manner of it, in &s;ome religious a&s;|&s;emblies, may be lame and defective, and in others too &s;uper&s;titious. I advi&s;e you therefore diligently to &s;earch the oracles of truth, and to work out your &s;alvation with fear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embling, from tho&s;e ex|cellent &s;ources. If you inquire with an unprejudiced and candid mind, after imploring the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, you will find what you &s;eek; you will know and learn to practi&s;e your duty towards God and towards man, and will, with the poet, come to this conclu&s;ion:

<L><HI>His can't be wrong who&s;e life is in the right.</HI></L></Q> Thank Providence, we live in a country, and under a government, where we may freely exerci&s;e our rea&s;oning faculties, may all wor|&s;hip God in the way we are convinced is right; and, though we may differ in &s;ome points of doctrine and di&s;cipline, we are all, after our &s;everal peculiar modes, pre&s;&s;ing forward to the &s;ame great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, "to the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." Let &s;ome &s;ects give up their rea&s;on; let others even di&s;|card the &s;criptures, on which our religion is founded; we will &s;till pity and pray for them, but neither hate nor per&s;ecute them; and, in&s;tead of adhering to the dogmas of men as fallible as our&s;elves, we will apply for light and truth where they are to be found, and re|member, with the great Chillingworth, that <HI>the Bible, the Bible alone, is the religion of Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>
