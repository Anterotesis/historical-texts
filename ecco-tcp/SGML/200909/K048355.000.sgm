<P>THE manu&s;cript copy of the follow|ing unaccountable, and mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, work fell into my hands, gentle reader, by the mere favour of good chance. For I being placed at my table, eating mine &s;upper, &s;ent for &s;ome chee&s;e for the &s;ame; and, lo, around it were wrap|ped
<PB N="ii" REF="4">&s;ome leaves of the treati&s;e now pre|&s;ented unto thee. My curio&s;ity being &s;tirred, I ha&s;ted to the chee&s;e-mongers, and was &s;o fortunate as to redeem the whole, except a few leaves, which were torn therefrom; and which defects I have carefully marked by a&s;teri&s;ms.</P>
<P>The chee&s;e-monger could give me no e&s;&s;ential information concerning the manu&s;cript, except that he bought it among others in Grub-&s;treet, from the effects of a decea&s;t author.</P>
<P>The author was without doubt of an elevated turn of mind, for he lived in a cock-loft: As to the treati&s;e it

<P>I could, after painful endeavours, learn nothing further concerning the author of this erudite and diverting work, except that he was born, and that he died; but where, and when, mu&s;t be left to the di&s;coveries of future anti|quaries.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Birth, parentage and education, of James Tory.</HEAD>
<P>A VAST, you critic, with the brown face and &s;harp no&s;e! What! you are already prying to di&s;cover &s;ome naked|ne&s;s, are you? You are rummaging your pockets for your little rule and line, to apply to this &s;ublime treati&s;e. But I let you to know that this great, and arduous, work has &s;o many angles, tangents, and ca|pricious excre&s;cences, that it &s;ets your rule
<PB N="2" REF="8">and line at defiance. Be gone then: call for pen, ink, and paper; and write &s;ome work of your own&mdash;and then write a cri|tici&s;m upon it&mdash;and reduce it to your rules.</P>
<P>Your rules, indeed! all rules have ex|ceptions: and, to confirm a proverb, I &s;hall tell you a little &s;tory:</P>
<P>A worthy old gentleman of my acquaint|ance, &s;ick of the gang of town &s;ervants, hired a raw lad from the country, and re|&s;olved to tutor him him&s;elf. So, upon the evening of Hob-nail's arrival, he was &s;um|moned to the parlour, and Te&s;ty began thus: "I do not wi&s;h, Hob, to over-load your memory with too many in&s;tructions at once; but I &s;hall content my&s;elf, my lad, with giving you one at a time; and when I &s;ee that you practi&s;e that, then I &s;hall give
<PB N="3" REF="9">you another. As you are but raw from the country, the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on I &s;hall give you is, to be upon your guard again&s;t the rogui&s;h deceptions of this vile town. In buying, make it a general rule never to give above half what is a&s;ked." Hob bowed, and re|tired. Next morning the po&s;tman comes with a letter, and a&s;ks &s;ixpence. Hob, re|membering the rule, pours threepence into his hand, and the door in his face. Rat tat a tat goes the knocker, again and again, &s;o as to alarm the neighbourhood, and awake my old gentleman, to the pangs of the gout, from his fir&s;t &s;lumber. The rea&s;on of the uproar is a&s;ked. The &s;tory is told. "D&mdash;n you for a fool," &s;ays old Te&s;ty, "do not you know that there is no rule without exceptions?"</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">This work, Mr. Critic, mu&s;t not be judged by rules, but by exceptions: and, to &s;hew you how much I de&s;pi&s;e your rules, I have a &s;trong inclination to begin my Tale of a Tub at the end, and &s;o to walk backwards like a crab to the beginning. But hold: I &s;hall not allow your rules to put me out of my way neither; &s;o I &s;hall begin at the beginning, and commence at the commencement; le&s;t I fall under the ignorant monk's de&s;cription of a Hebrew book, Item, a book which begins at the end.</P>
<P>The place, and time, of James Tory's birth are &s;trongly conte&s;ted among the lite|rati. Some &s;ay that he was a relation of Nimrod, and laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the Tower of Babel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, he was born with the fir&s;t Monarchy. WARBURTON.</NOTE>. Others &s;ay that he was
<PB N="5" REF="11">the &s;on of one of the Patriarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Filmer's Patriarchal Scheme, wherein ab&s;olute indefca&s;ible right is derived from the Patri|archs. WARBURTON.</NOTE>. Some profound antiquaries, as M. Gebelin, M. Baily, Dr. Par&s;ons, and Colonel Vallancey, do mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert that James Tory was begot, by the Devil, upon Eve; and that Adam was made a cuckold while he was eating the apple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is not certain whether in was an apple that Adam are. Some &s;uppo&s;e the fatal fruit to be the pear, called <HI>Cui&s;&s;e Madame.</HI> STEEVENS.</NOTE>. They al&s;o add, that Satan laid a&s;ide his crown of horns upon this occa&s;ion, that he might not frighten his mi&s;tre&s;s; and that Adam clapped it upon his own head: and from that memorable hour, horns and cuckoldry have been concatenated. They al&s;o add, that the word James, in the Sham&s;crit and Malabaric languages, &s;ignifies <HI>love,</HI> and that Tory means <HI>power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">From this have Lord Monboddo, and &s;ome other clear metaphy&s;icians, concluded that this is a nut: and that the kernel of allegory is, that Satan being kicked out of the upper boxes for his love of power; and the &s;ame love of power being, as Chaucer tells, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, indeed the e&s;|&s;ential form, of woman; the two loves of power, thus coale&s;cing, begot a quinte&s;&s;en|tial form of love of power; which form was called James Tory. I hope what I have &s;aid is not clear. If it be clear, the reader has only to &s;ubmit it, by letter, to Lord Monboddo, and he will render it as dark as any metaphy&s;ical que&s;tion needs to be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The darkne&s;s or tenebrancy of metaphy&s;ics progene|rates from the tenebrificous o&s;citancy of man. JOHNSON.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James Tory, from a child, was always fond of riding upon a high hor&s;e, and
<PB N="7" REF="13">looking down upon his equals. He u&s;ed to &s;ay that he was a king, nay king of kings; and &s;ome thought him very wi&s;e; and &s;ome thought his brain was not a little deranged. He would often tell the little boys, his companions, that they were but ants and vermin; while he was the very image and lieutenant of God. They, in return, told him that he was an unruly brat, and only &s;uperior to them in pride and uncharitablene&s;s; and that they knew him better than the mother that bore him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an evident allu&s;ion to the Hi&s;tory of JOHN Daw&s;on and his Mother, printed at London, 1593, 4to. black letter. STEEVENS.</NOTE>. He told them he had always a &s;ure argu|ment to convince the refractory. They a&s;ked for his argument; and as he was a &s;tout boy, and loved to play with tho&s;e weaker than him&s;elf, he would kick them all round, and then take their &s;ugar plumbs
<PB N="8" REF="14">from them. Even when grown up, this was his chief argument in debate; and he called it his <HI>argumentum ad puerum;</HI> for the <HI>argumentum ad hominem</HI> he did not like, and never u&s;ed.</P>
<P>When he came to man's-e&s;tate, he was the loyale&s;t &s;ubject the king had. He &s;aid that kings were the images of God, e&s;pecially in&s;pired by him, and infallible. That men were made for kings, as &s;heep are made for men. That the Devil was the fir&s;t whig, and &s;tood at the head of the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition. A grave man pre&s;ent told him, that he was &s;peaking rank bla&s;phemy, by comparing the weakne&s;s and fallibility of man, with the omnipotence and infal|libility of his Creator. That kings had generally two legs, and &s;eldom three eyes; and that they were not only men, but,
<PB N="9" REF="15">in virtue of their education, the weake&s;t of men. That till he could prove that kings were endued with all the perfections of the Deity&mdash;"That I &s;hall prove at once," &s;aid James; and knocked the grave man down.</P>
<P>But the grave man was a per&s;onage of wealth and influence: and the con&s;equence was that James was bani&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> How James Tory came to England and became manager of an e&s;tate.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES was thus forced to &s;et &s;ail, and abandon his native country. After many adventures, not recorded in this authentic hi&s;tory, James was landed in England.</P>
<P>His proud humour &s;tuck clo&s;e by him, and expo&s;ed him to many di&s;agreeable acci|dents. He was rolled in the kennel, at the point of Port&s;mouth, for u&s;ing his <HI>argu|mentum
<PB N="11" REF="17">ad pucrum</HI> to an Engli&s;h &s;ailor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ballad of Jack and Sall. STEEVENS.</NOTE>; and was to&s;&s;ed into a dung cart for repeat|ing it to a carman.</P>
<P>James thought he had got into the in|fernal regions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A learned allu&s;ion, <HI>le roi d'Angleterre e&s;t le roi d'enfer,</HI> &s;ays a French proverb. WARBURTON.</NOTE>; and being, like other blu&s;tering bullies, a coward at heart, was about to be circum&s;pect, when a certain Lord made James the manager of an e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Here James was in his element. He again called him&s;elf the lieutenant of God; and oppre&s;&s;ed the poor tenants, and &s;hared their &s;poils with the rich ones. He be|came fond of the rich tenants, becau&s;e they &s;upported and &s;hared his extortions.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">He was al&s;o a great u&s;urer; and a&s;piring to get &s;oon rich by this practice, as he was one evening &s;moking a pipe with the par|&s;on of the pari&s;h, he reque&s;ted the par&s;on to preach again&s;t u&s;ury. The hone&s;t cler|gyman told him that it might he looked upon as a &s;atire again&s;t James him&s;elf; and that he begged to be excu&s;ed. But James in&s;i&s;ting violently, the par&s;on pro|mi&s;ed that he would: and, accordingly, next Sunday he preached &s;o well again&s;t this crying vice, that all the u&s;urers in the neighbourhood were frightened, and gave up the trade, &s;o that James got the whole.</P>
<P>James, though the greate&s;t knave in the pari&s;h, always affected great piety. He would pray, and roll up the whites of his eyes, in the high way. "Church and King" was his con&s;tant toa&s;t; and when he
<PB N="13" REF="19">wanted to oppre&s;s any poor tenant, in an extraordinary way, he always took a cler|gyman with him, and gave him part of the &s;poils; and &s;aid all that he did was for the &s;ervice of God, and the good of the church.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed to ob&s;erve that the barbarians, who e&s;tabli&s;hed the feudal &s;y&s;tem of king and ari&s;tocracy, and forgot that the people were men, were very wi&s;e. For wi&s;dom could only be found in kings, and nobles, and clergy; and was denied to all el&s;e for wi&s;e purpo&s;es. For the people were mere <HI>pecora campi;</HI> and their bu&s;ine&s;s was, like bees, to make honey for the king, peers, and clergy; and then to be &s;inged to death for their pains.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> Digre&s;&s;ion on E&s;tates.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE always admired what par&s;on Adams calls "the pede&s;trian expedition", becau&s;e of the perfect freedom which attends it. In a coach or in a chai&s;e, one cannot look every way, &s;ir; and one cannot &s;top to get out, and examine every thing curious. An equipage is one of the many mi&s;eries of the great; and forms one link of the chain of formality, which con&s;trains them, and prevents that free enjoyment of exi&s;tence, which the great would envy the pea&s;antry for, if they had &s;en&s;e enough to form an idea of its delights.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21">In a buggy, madam, or upon a hor&s;e, one is forced to attend more to the hor&s;e than to the land&s;cape; whereas on foot one is quite at one's ea&s;e. One may &s;tep to a ditch to gather a wild flower, one may a&s;cend a hill to enjoy a pro&s;pect, one may de&s;cend into a hollow glen to look up at a ca&s;cade, one may &mdash; but hold! What may one not do?</P>
<P>Now this profound work is a &s;pecies of pede&s;trian expedition in literature. The author is not mounted in the phaeton of poetry, nor in the chai&s;e of di&s;&s;ertation, nor in the buggy of novel-writing, nor up|on the hor&s;e of critici&s;m, and far le&s;s in the &s;tate-coach of hi&s;tory. No, &s;ir, he is a literary Powell; only he does not walk for a wager. Rather he is upon a pede&s;trian excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure, and is re&s;olved to &s;ee
<PB N="16" REF="22">and de&s;cribe any object which &s;trikes him, though it may be a little out of his way. The only rule he &s;hall &s;ollow in his digre&s;|&s;ions and wanderings, is not to forget his road and get into a mora&s;s.</P>
<P>E&s;tates are of many kinds, but chiefly of three. If managed by one per&s;on, it is an emblem of monarchy; if by a few of the richer tenants, it is an ari&s;tocracy; if by all in conjunction for common good, it is a democracy.</P>
<P>Each plan has its faults and its excellen|cies.</P>
<P>Faults are.</P>
<P>In a monarchy, it is ten to one if the manager does not forget that he is made for the tenants, and not the tenants for him.
<PB N="17" REF="23">Hence he becomes a tyrant, and commands about him without law or rea&s;on. You fellow, you have a fair e&s;tate of your own, give it to me, or I &s;hall put you to death. You, Dick, you have a hand&s;ome wife, you uncon&s;cionable dog, lend her to me for a night, or you &s;hall be hanged in her gar|ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author is &s;o full of double meanings, that I take this to allude to the Order of the Garter. STEEVENS.
<P>An error of the learned critic. The &s;en&s;e is literal. WARBURTON.</P></NOTE>. But this is nothing. The tenants tremble before their tyrant, and get &s;lavi&s;h and lazy, and cannot have &s;pirits to work; &s;o all are unhappy, and the e&s;tate goes to wreck, and is &s;old to the be&s;t bidder. Per|haps the manager is a weak man, and knows it; and in this ca&s;e the tyranny is wor&s;e. He buys him a certain number of che&s;ts, with good locks, which cannot be picked. Then by degrees he puts impo&s;itions upon
<PB N="18" REF="24">the tenants, till he &s;queezes mo&s;t of their money into the &s;aid che&s;ts. Then he em|ploys <HI>his</HI> ca&s;h in bribing the better &s;ort of tenants to do as he plea&s;es; and they employ <HI>theirs</HI> in bribing the inferior cla&s;s. And thus the money of the tenants is employed in bribing them; and all is one ma&s;s of cor|ruption. O fy!</P>
<Q><L>Give me &s;ome civet, good apothecary,</L>
<L>To &s;weeten mine imagination.</L></Q>
<P>A general pe&s;tilence is not &s;o de&s;tructive to mankind as general corruption in a &s;tate. The one de&s;troys the body, the other the &s;oul. All hone&s;ty is tainted. Con&s;cience hangs quite wide and loo&s;e; and is at la&s;t cut into &s;hreds and made into a pur&s;e. This is the wor&s;t kind of tyranny, and the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of bad government. Open de&s;po|ti&s;m only degrades the mind; but this
<PB N="19" REF="25">blackens, rots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More &s;cientifically, 'it nigrates and putredinates.' JOHNSON.</NOTE>, and annihilates it. Not to add that, in the former, the tenants can do nothing again&s;t main force; while, in the latter, they have the additional con&s;o|lation to know that all is owing to their own &s;implicity, and that they are oppre&s;&s;ed becau&s;e they are dupes.</P>
<P>The faults of ari&s;tocratical management are chiefly, that here are many tyrants, in|&s;tead of one; and the evil increa&s;es in pro|portion. One may e&s;cape the attention of one tyrant, but a number forms an Argus, with a hundred eyes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the in&s;cription which a gentleman put upon his library, 'Hic Argus e&s;to non Briarius.' STEEVENS.</NOTE>, and nothing e&s;capes them. My neighbour may be one of the tyrants, and may take a fancy to my garden. If the ari&s;tocracy be hereditary, it is &s;till
<PB N="20" REF="26">wor&s;e than if elective; for the latter will &s;tand upon character, will run after the &s;ha|dow of fame; while the members of the former may be gamblers and hor&s;e-jockeys. What then? They are born better than other men; their very vices and faults are entitled to re&s;pect; and they are univer&s;ally re&s;pect|ed and imitated. O ho, &s;ays Beelzebub, this is my own invention. I have a <HI>patent</HI> for it. Yes, infernal daemon, what plan could con|tribute &s;o much to people your domains, as to in&s;titute a hereditary order of right ho|nourable vices, to attract the re&s;pect and imitation of all mankind?</P>
<P>The faults of a democracy, in managing an e&s;tate, con&s;i&s;t chiefly in its envy of merit: for, as all are equal, the people think that merit and abilities are al&s;o equally &s;hared among them, which will never be the ca&s;e;
<PB N="21" REF="27">and if &s;uperior merit appear, all join in an <HI>o&s;traci&s;m</HI> again&s;t it. This management like|wi&s;e tends much to anarchy, and anarchy to tyranny. Nay a democracy, if not very wi&s;ely adju&s;ted, is often the wor&s;t of all tyrannies, exerted again&s;t particular cla&s;&s;es of its own members. <HI>Contrariorum eadem e&s;t ratio:</HI> which means, madam, that if you will bend a &s;erpent round, and put its tail in its mouth, the head and tail will become all one. Let us not, however, confound a <HI>plethocracy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plethocracy is from the Greek, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the mob.</HI> WARB.</NOTE> with a <HI>democracy,</HI> the govern|ment of the mob with the government of the people. The mob in modern countries is, in political con&s;ideration, of the &s;ame account with the &s;laves in Greece and Rome. Not that they &s;hould be real &s;laves, but on the contrary as free and happy as their &s;ta|tion and education will permit; but, as the
<PB N="22" REF="28">ancient &s;laves, they &s;hould hold no &s;hare of government, even in a democracy. The rea&s;on is their want of education, the vio|lence of their pa&s;&s;ions, and the weakne&s;s of their rea&s;on. They are perpetual children, and not even to be tru&s;ted with the manage|ment of them&s;elves, le&s;t they &s;hould do them&s;elves harm. A democracy &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of the middle ranks of people; and its &s;uperiority to other forms ari&s;es from this, that the middle cla&s;s is always the mo&s;t en|lightened, and the mo&s;t rational of the com|munity; neither giddy with power and wealth, nor deba&s;ed by the frozen hand of penury.</P>

<P>Both the&s;e circum&s;tances operated again&s;t the requi&s;ition of James. The knees of the farmers were very &s;tiff, and were bent with much the &s;ame facility as tho&s;e of an ele|phant. James was dirty as well as proud, and his floors were none of the cleane&s;t. So the farmers began to be clamorous, and a meeting was called, when a clever young fellow got up and &s;poke thus:</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">"We are informed in &s;cripture, my friends, that pride was not made for man. It is &s;o heterogeneous to his nature and condition, that, if introduced into his frame, it &s;aps the very powers of rea&s;on by &s;low but &s;ure degrees. It is like cyder, which intoxicates by inflation. It is a windy com|plaint; and, if not emitted downwards, flies to the brain and &s;wells it with extravagant &s;chemes. If many a great conqueror and rattling blade had had able phy&s;icians, the world would never have been troubled with them. It appears to me, under favour, that a &s;trong carminative has become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our manager James Tory. As I know a little of medicine, I &s;hall prepare a carminative draught, and carry it to him my&s;elf."</P>
<P>The farmers were all plea&s;ed with this motion; and gave Will Whig, for this was
<PB N="28" REF="34">the young man's name, full power to pre|pare, and admini&s;ter the &s;aid carminative potion to James Tory, in their names.</P>
<P>Will &s;oon got the draught ready, and being admitted to the pre&s;ence of James, addre&s;&s;ed him in &s;uch terms as the&s;e:</P>
<P>"Mr. James, the tenants upon this e&s;tate being informed, by evident &s;ymptoms, that you are much troubled with a windy com|plaint called pride, have de&s;ired me to pre|&s;ent this potion to you, which will prove a &s;peedy and effectual cure."</P>
<P>James was &s;o convul&s;ed with rage, that at fir&s;t he could neither &s;peak nor move. But when he recovered the u&s;e of his tongue, and of his hands, he employed the former in calling Will a thou&s;and ugly names, and
<PB N="29" REF="35">the latter in throwing the potion in his face, and breaking the pot on his head.</P>
<P>As Will was prepared for &s;uch a recep|tion, he contented him&s;elf with tripping up the heels of James, and left him &s;praw|ling upon his dirty floor.</P>

<P>As to the parentage of Will, there are many di&s;putes among the antiquaries and

Some &s;ay that the family was originally of Greek extraction; others &s;ay Roman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Becau&s;e the abhorrible e&s;&s;ence of Whiggi&s;m is de|ducted, by many, from the revive&s;cence of erudition, and the liberate &s;pirit of the Greek and Roman au|thors.

<P>After much lucubration and great exa|mination of this &s;ubject, I am inclined to
<PB N="32" REF="38">think that the Whig family came to this country from the woods of Germany. Their features and manners agreed &s;o per|fectly with the de&s;cription of the ancient Germans, given us by that wag Tacitus, that I have little doubt upon this &s;core; and the con&s;tant tradition of the family confirms this idea. If the reader will not believe me, let him, to u&s;e the &s;tyle of Dr. Bentley, go and think for him&s;elf, and be d&mdash;d. I remember I once con|vinced a great antiquary, that the Whigs were of German extract, after all my other arguments had failed, by telling him that Will Whig always u&s;ed both hands to buckle his &s;hoes, as the Germans gene|rally do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An argument mu&s;t be accommodated to the auditor. <HI>Intellectus e&s;t in intelligente, ad modum intelligentis.</HI> WAR|BURTON.</NOTE>.

See Tacitus in Germania. WARBURTON.</NOTE>. But they afterwards fell back in the world; and had lived in poverty and neglect for many gene|rations.</P>
<P>Will's father was a plain indu&s;trious hu&s;bandman; and his mother a comely clean old woman, as good a manager as ever trode in &s;hoes; but withal as good a &s;cold as ever wore out a tongue.</P>
<P>As Will was their only &s;on, and a pro|mi&s;ing youth, they had made a &s;hift to give him a good education at &s;chool and college. Whence he imbibed a &s;pirit &s;u|perior

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VIII.</HI> How Will Whig oppo&s;ed James Tory.</HEAD>
<P>LET me return to my &s;ubject. It may ea&s;ily be believed that, after the adventure which has been narrated, James Tory &s;in|gled out Will Whig for the object of his mo&s;t cordial dete&s;tation. Nor was Will wanting in return.</P>
<P>James did every thing in his power to mortify Will; and Will wrote &s;atires upon James, and &s;ent them all over the pari&s;h. James could not puni&s;h Will, becau&s;e it
<PB N="42" REF="48">was not then di&s;covered that truth was a libel.</P>
<P>But the enmity between them was further exa&s;perated upon the following occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>James, as the reader has been told, was very pious, and a pious knave is the wor&s;t of all; for a common knave pays &s;ome re|&s;pect to common rules, but a pious knave has no rule but his internal feelings; and &s;ets all human laws and &s;ocial decencies at defi|ance. Nor is it a crime to cheat the ungodly.</P>
<P>Now James, in his great piety and chri&s;|tian charity, formed a book of prayers for children<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Surely an allu&s;ion to the Book of Common Prayer, propo&s;es to the Church of Scotland in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, and which was the fir&s;t &s;pring of the grand rebellion. WARBURTON.</NOTE>; and would in&s;i&s;t upon this book
<PB N="43" REF="49">being u&s;ed by the di&s;&s;enting tenants; though they thanked him, and &s;aid they could pray very well. He &s;wore a great oath that if they would not kneel to him, they &s;hould at lea&s;t kneel to God. They became angry; and &s;aid they would not kneel becau&s;e it was pagan, and an invention of anti-chri&s;t; and that they believed that James him&s;elf was but a ba&s;tard of the whore of Babel. Will Whig laughed at all this, but encou|raged them in their ob&s;tinacy; becau&s;e u&s;e|ful to him in his de&s;igns again&s;t James To|ry. Wi&s;e men &s;ometimes encourage the folly of others, becau&s;e it &s;erves their pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute was terminated by an old woman, who threw a joint &s;tool at the head of James Tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was really the well known termination of this great &s;cheme. WARBURTON.</NOTE>. James was carried home
<PB N="44" REF="50">in bad plight, and never had courage to re|vive his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>But, as his hot head was fertile in pro|jects, he re&s;olved to build a boat for his amu&s;ement when he went a fi&s;hing, and to make all the tenants contribute to the ex|pence of this boat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This allegory mu&s;t refer to the &s;hip-money affair, another &s;pring of the grand rebellion.

This turned out &s;till wor&s;e than the praying &s;cheme; for, as philo&s;ophers ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, a man's pur&s;e is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;itive part about him; and he will defend it at the ri&s;que of his life. The tenants were all alarmed; and &s;aw that if they yielded to this demand it would be|come a precedent for future exactions. A meeting was called, and Will Whig took the chair. It was re&s;olved, with only two di&s;&s;entient voices, not to pay a penny.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">James being informed of this meeting, came to it with &s;ome &s;oldiers to &s;eize upon Will Whig<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is this the vi&s;it of Charles I. to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons in order to &s;eize the refractory members? WAR|BURTON.
<P>The dubiety of the erudite commentator is a proof of &s;omnolency for the apparence is clarificous. JOHNSON.</P></NOTE>, but Will had e&s;caped before his arrival.</P>
<P>Matters now came to the la&s;t extremity between James and Will. Both had fol|lowers, and many &s;kirmi&s;hes and &s;ome &s;harp battles happened between them. But Will at the end got the better, and &s;hut James up in his hou&s;e, not to appear upon pain of a broken head.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now was how to manage the e&s;tate; and, as in all ferments the &s;cum is apt to get uppermo&s;t, &s;o it happened here.
<PB N="46" REF="52">Some of the di&s;&s;enting tenants were the wor&s;t fanatics, that were ever blown up, like empty bladders, with crazy enthu&s;ia&s;m.

<P>But no &s;ooner were they in&s;talled, than they &s;hewed that their religion was but a cloke for &s;elf-intere&s;t. Bayle's famous pro|blem, that athei&s;m is le&s;s hurtful to &s;ociety than &s;uper&s;tition, was verified at once.
<PB N="47" REF="53">Every one was guided by his own inward light; and guided to actions which in others would have been e&s;teemed diabolical, but as they were the deeds of the godly were all holy. The inward light was &s;o variou&s;ly refracted and reflected in their mental pri&s;ms and mirrors, that it proved a mere wild|fire, and led them into mora&s;&s;es; where they would &s;trip them&s;elves naked and dance in the mud, to the no &s;mall merriment of the bye&s;tanders.

<P>At la&s;t one of them, who was a very cunning and clever fellow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oliver Cromwell. WARBURTON.</NOTE>, and only a pretender to the inward light, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;oldiers, &s;eized upon the&s;e

<P>Will Whig was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed to find a new manager in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and with all the tyrannical powers and di&s;po&s;i|tions of James Tory. Will re&s;olved not to allow one of his comrades to be his lord and ma&s;ter; and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the old &s;oldiers, he turned him out; and James Tory, taking advantage of the tumult, got his place again.</P>

<P>The con&s;equence was, that James, in|&s;tead of being grateful for the unexpected re&s;titution of his place, was exa&s;perated at the ill u&s;age he had met with; anal now looked upon all the tenants as his enemies.

<P><PB N="52" REF="58">Will Whig, who&s;e generous heart could not bear to &s;ee even folly and fanatici&s;m cru&s;hed by oppre&s;&s;ion, warmly took their part; and going to the pre&s;ence of James, who was then dallying with a favourite mi|&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An allu&s;ion to the whoremonger&s;hip of Charles II.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XI.</HI> How Will Whig increa&s;ed the rents, and em|ployed them in bribery.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS, what heart or head can bear the giddy elevation of power! Power is like an intoxicating liquor, the more that is drank the more is called for, till at la&s;t the drinker is lo&s;t in ab&s;olute &s;tupor! Such is the effect of power, that mo&s;t of the royal races in the world have terminated in imbe|cillity; witne&s;s, among others, the two fir&s;t regal progenies of France; and the Saxon races of England, which began with men of talents, and terminated with &s;aints!</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67">Even Will Whig, as hone&s;t a lad as ever breathed, with a heart as warm as &s;ummer, and a head as cool as autumn, could not with|&s;tand the inflating draught of power.</P>
<P>He &s;oon begun to dre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o like James Tory, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h them at a di&s;tance. The tenants were all &s;urpri&s;ed at the change; but &s;oon learned, at their expence, that a manager will be a manager.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of his old familiar intercour&s;e with the tenants, Will never went out but with a troop of his watchmen about him, as much as to &s;ay, "Keep your di&s;tance!" In&s;tead of his old hearty laugh, he would hardly deign to &s;mile: and he forbad the tenants to have any puppet-&s;hows, before he had &s;een
<PB N="62" REF="68">them, le&s;t the puppets &s;hould mimic the change of his behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The act for re&s;training the freedom of the &s;tage. WARBURTON.</NOTE>.s</P>
<P>He took &s;uch a liking to a piece of ground he had, in a country called Henland, lying beyond Frogland, that he would often re|tire there, and wa&s;te the rents of the e&s;tate in idle frolics. Nay, he has been heard to declare that he would, at any time, &s;acrifice the management of the e&s;tate to the inte|re&s;ts of Henland.</P>
<P>Upon pretence of the nece&s;&s;ity of a greater number of watchmen, to defend the proper|ty of the tenants, he rai&s;ed new contribu|tions; and then &s;ent the watchmen to de|fend his own ground in Henland. The tenants began to murmur; but their mur|murs were increa&s;ed when Will Whig, up|on
<PB N="63" REF="69">various pretences, rai&s;ed all the rents of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>James Tory dared not to venture upon &s;uch a trying mea&s;ure; for he was &s;en&s;ible that the tenants hated him, and might mur|der him if he gave &s;uch great provocation. But Will was &s;o much per&s;uaded of the con|fidence, which the tenants repo&s;ed in him, that he thought they would oppo&s;e no mea|&s;ure of his.</P>
<P>The tenants, however, were very clamor|ous upon this occa&s;ion; and Will found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e effectual means to pacify them.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he called &s;ome of the richer tenants to his cabinet; and told them that he did not mean to have the &s;ole profit
<PB N="64" REF="70">of the&s;e exorbitant rents, but that, if they would &s;upport his cau&s;e, he &s;hould give each of them a &s;hare of the emoluments. The rich tenants greedily a&s;&s;ented to the propo|&s;al: and Will &s;aid that he found "Every man had his price."</P>
<P>The tenants who before were an hone&s;t good &s;ort of people, &s;oon became the wick|ede&s;t &s;et in the world. An univer&s;al cor|ruption took place. Their time, which was formerly employed in u&s;eful labour, and rural recreations, was now &s;pent in ale|hou&s;es, and gambling.</P>
<P>"No management can be carried on with|out influence; and money is the &s;ure&s;t in|fluence," became an univer&s;al maxim among the tenants. The wi&s;er &s;hook their heads; and &s;aid that a &s;ecret and my&s;terious ma|nagement,
<PB N="65" REF="71">for the intere&s;t of a few indivi|duals, indeed required influence of a parti|cular kind. But an open and liberal plan of management, calculated for the benefit of all, required no influence but the good opinion of the greater part of the tenants, which was &s;ure to attend it.</P>
<P>"Mankind," &s;aid they, "have always been u&s;ed as children by their governors. Nothing can be more &s;imple than a good government: nothing more complex than a bad. Frankne&s;s incites confidence; and my&s;tery annuls it. Secrecy in government is u&s;ele&s;s either to friends or enemies. Wax is a &s;y&s;tem of wickedne&s;s; and therefore &s;e|crecy &s;hould attend its projects. But in peace, no government &s;hould have my&s;teries; and mo&s;t e&s;pecially not to its own people. A king &s;hould come forward and &s;ay, 'My
<PB N="66" REF="72">people, my friends, your good is mine, our intere&s;ts are one. I have no projects but for your happine&s;s; I &s;hall tell you freely what I mean to do; and do you tell me freely what you with.'</P>
<P>Thus did they compare their grounds to a kingdom: and &s;urely the government of both &s;hould be equally &s;imple, and for the common good.</P>
<P>Will however &s;till had his own way. At fir&s;t he u&s;ed to follow the wi&s;hes of the tenants; but now he had only to propo&s;e a &s;cheme, and it was carried by a majority.</P>
<P>Some of the tenants, however, were left virtuous, becau&s;e Will could not afford to bribe all. They began frankly to tell Will that he was as great a knave as James Tory,
<PB N="67" REF="73">and paid as little attention to the good of the tenants; and that they would call back James if he did not reform.</P>
<P>"Are not you a great rogue," &s;aid one of them to Will, "to oppre&s;s tho&s;e very peo|ple who made you manager? Think on the carminative draught, which you exhi|bited to James Tory; and take one your|&s;elf, for you need it. As for James, he was born a tyrannous fellow, and we never knew him otherwi&s;e: but for you, one of us, a creature of our own making to follow his example, nay, to oppre&s;s us more than he did! You &s;hall be taught better manners, in faith!"</P>

<P>He told them how much he had been mi&s;|repre&s;ented in his ab&s;ence, as he learned from the friends he yet had on the e&s;tate: he a&s;k|ed them what they had gained by exchang|ing his admini&s;tration for Will Whig's?

<P>James was &s;oon at all the &s;ecret meetings, which the di&s;contented tenants held, to con|cert

<P>He retaliated all Will's old invectives again&s;t his management upon that of Will. He &s;poke much of the public good, and of liberty, and property.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XIII.</HI> Digre&s;&s;on upon Oppo&s;ition.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is called oppo&s;ition in great matters, is in &s;mall called contradiction; a quality with which every ma&s;ter of a family mu&s;t be tolerably well acquainted.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of contradiction, in a family, is generally of the feminine gender; and it is well known that it does not proceed &s;o much from a de&s;ire of liberty, as from a de&s;ire of power.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80">This is al&s;o very often the ca&s;e with op|po&s;ition in a political &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>One would imagine that if every man, in an a&s;&s;embly, voted according to his con&s;ci|ence, he would hardly, in any two que&s;tions, find him&s;elf exactly in the &s;ame company. Yet it &s;o happens, in &s;ome great a&s;&s;emblies, that the &s;ame body of men will ever propo&s;e que&s;tions; and another body, acting as one man, always oppo&s;e them. It is an obvious point that neither body has any con&s;cience, or attends to the public good.</P>
<P>This will further appear, when we con|&s;ider that, put the one body of men upon the right &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and the others oppo&s;ite; in a word make them change places; and the very &s;ame mea&s;ures will be propo&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="81">by the oppo&s;ing body, and oppo&s;ed by the propo&s;ing.</P>
<P>No point in natural philo&s;ophy has &s;o much puzzled the adepts as this.</P>
<P>Some think it proceeds from animal mag|neti&s;m; and imagine that there mu&s;t be a principle of attraction upon one &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and of repul&s;ion upon the other.</P>
<P>Others &s;uppo&s;e that the whole my&s;tery proceeds upon the principles of electricity; and that, as the ancients believed, that when it thundered upon the right hand it was a happy omen, but when upon the left unfor|tunate, &s;o in this ca&s;e the electric fire of elo|quence is regarded as fortunate on the right, and unfortunate upon the left; and, as when men &s;it facing, the right hand of the one is
<PB N="76" REF="82">in oppo&s;ition to the left of the other, each body turns to the right, and &s;o the a&s;&s;embly con&s;tantly opinionates, and divides, as the members happen to &s;it. Q. E. D.</P>
<P>But others, not contented with this &s;olu|tion, account for the fact in this way. They &s;uppo&s;e that there is &s;u&s;pended in a net, fixt to the roof of the hou&s;e, a certain number of pur&s;es and patents, to which the members are con&s;tantly looking up. And as they can|not a&s;cend to reach the &s;aid net, except by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by forming them&s;elves into &s;uch pyramids of men, as are &s;hewn at Sadler's Wells; it is nece&s;&s;ary that each body &s;hould keep together, for the benefit of all its members. Nay, as at Sadler's Wells, if one man of the pyramid were to <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> from the others in any <HI>motion,</HI> it would
<PB N="77" REF="83">ruin the pyramid; &s;uch is nearly the ca&s;e here.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e pyramids of men is commonly called a mini&s;try, and the other an oppo&s;ition. The man at the top of the former is king for the time, and can ea&s;ily reach at the patents and pur&s;es, and hand them down to tho&s;e who <HI>&s;upport</HI> him. The latter pyramid is &s;o &s;hort, that the man at the top cannot reach to the net, till he can per&s;uade &s;ome of the bottom &s;upporters of the other pyramid to lend a hand to his.</P>
<P>A mini&s;try is vulgarly defined to be a body of men who impo&s;e taxes upon the people, that the mini&s;try may be enabled to bribe their repre&s;entatives. This is called the per|fection of government; and by &s;ome the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84">In this excellent plan of government, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the people be dupes; el&s;e they will be apt to laugh at the idea of being bribed with their own money. They will &s;ay, "We &s;hall not pay enormous taxes, to enable you to govern arbitrarily by bribery. No. Relieve us of our taxes, and govern arbitrarily by power. Deliver us from our repre&s;entatives, and from the taxes we pay to bribe them; and govern us as you plea&s;e, as indeed you do at any rate".</P>
<P>As to an oppo&s;ition it has been briefly defined, "a &s;et of men who with to be mi|ni&s;ters."</P>
<P>Liberty, and the public good, are names for certain pills, &s;old both by mini&s;terial and anti-mini&s;terial quack-doctors; and are
<PB N="79" REF="85">thought a &s;overeign cure for the jaundice, &s;ore eyes, and other political evils.</P>
<P>But as the mini&s;terial quacks generally &s;et up their carriages, and live at their ea&s;e, they commonly leave the &s;aid pills, and other little medicines, to be &s;old by the quacks of oppo&s;ition, who would otherwi&s;e be at a lo&s;s how to live, and <HI>il faut vivre.</HI></P>
<P>An oppo&s;ition mountebank gets often upon a &s;tage, called the hu&s;tings, where he eats fire, and vomits flame, and handles &s;erpents, and all for the public good. Over his head is a board, in&s;cribed LIBERTY AND PRO|PERTY. And after a &s;peech in much the following terms, he &s;ells his medicines and machines:</P>

<P>THE tenants were, after all that had pa&s;t, not di&s;atisfied &s;o much with Will Whig's management, as they had been with that of James Tory; for Will, with all his faults, had done more towards the real improve|ment of the e&s;tate in a few years, than James had done in his long management. All the great, and public-&s;pirited, &s;chemes, which had ever been entered into by the tenants, originated in Will's noddle.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="98">James Tory was, however, u&s;ing all the arts he could, to undermine Will; and art was the chief talent of James: whereas Will was, upon the whole, a frank open fellow, and too wi&s;e to be cunning, except now and then to guard again&s;t James, and then with a fox he was a fox and a half.</P>
<P>James found, however, that he made &s;ome progre&s;s in the good-will of the tenants, becau&s;e he got, and kept together a number of them, who oppo&s;ed Will in &s;ome points prejudicial to their intere&s;ts. But he could not hope to get the management again as long as Will kept all his &s;en&s;es about him; and he was forming &s;chemes how to admini&s;ter to Will a &s;trong opiate, when an accident gave him all the advantage which he could de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="99">Will was riding his high hor&s;e one morn|ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, allegoricaly, at the beginning of a new reign. WARBURTON.</NOTE>, when lo! at the turning of a lane, &s;tood James Tory's a&s;s eating thi&s;tles.</P>

<P>James, in the mean while, availed him&s;elf of the illne&s;s of Will; and as no other per|&s;on offered, the Lord appointed, and the tenants, reluctantly, con&s;ented that James &s;hould re&s;ume the management.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XVI.</HI> How James bribed, and &s;wore, and lied.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES Tory found the greater part of the tenants &s;o adver&s;e to his admini&s;tration, that he was forced to improve upon Will Whig's plan of bribery. Hardly was there left a tenant upon the e&s;tate who did not fall a prey to '&s;aint-&s;educing gold.'</P>
<P>He pretended that he forgave all his old enemies, and that there &s;hould be no more
<PB N="95" REF="101">parties upon the e&s;tate; but he always em|ployed his old friends, and did not like the adherents of Will Whig. He would, how|ever, &s;end the latter upon any dangerous bu|&s;ine&s;s, that if it failed they might bear the blame; whereas, if it &s;ucceeded, he knew that he &s;hould have all the prai&s;e, with the additional &s;ame of being candid and impar|tial.</P>
<P>He &s;wore &s;olemnly, and repeatedly, that he was an hone&s;t man; and encouraged &s;wearing &s;o much by rule, that no tenant could &s;ell a pennyworth of &s;nuff, without &s;wearing that it was right &s;nuff, and paid ex|ci&s;e. Swearing proceeded to &s;uch a pitch, that at la&s;t the tenants came one night and burned the pillory; and agreed that every man &s;hould &s;wear what he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102">This was the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as James was always a pretender to great piety: and, upon the re&s;umption of his office, he re|newed his acquaintance with the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, and turned up the whites of his eyes, as before.</P>
<P>Adver&s;ity had indeed taught James a little moderation; but at bottom he was &s;till the &s;ame man. Will Whig had carried many dangerous mea&s;ures by art and per&s;ua&s;ion; but James was always for force. "D&mdash;n you, do you oppo&s;e my &s;overeign will?" was his common expre&s;&s;ion to unruly tenants. Even in bribery, in&s;tead of putting a pur&s;e of gold into a tenant's pocket, he would often throw it at his head, and knock him down with it.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103">Withal he was a mon&s;trous lyar. He in|deed no longer in&s;i&s;ted that the tenants &s;hould believe a cru&s;t of bread to be the leg of a duck, but he would tell them that a notorious knave was an hone&s;t man; that a highway|man was the fitte&s;t per&s;on to be a Ju&s;tice of Peace, becau&s;e he had experience of bu&s;ine&s;s; and the like.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XVII.</HI> How James lo&s;t a part of the e&s;tate.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a large extent of ground, be|longing to the e&s;tate, which lay upon the further &s;ide of a large river; and was chiefly inhabited by the wor&s;hippers of Calvin. James hated this wor&s;hip cordially, for he was, at heart, a Roman Catholic, and a great favourer of Catholics. The tenants of this part had, however, in &s;ome degree, e&s;caped the rapacity of James, becau&s;e being at a di|&s;tance, his authority over them was not &s;o immediate.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106">James, wi&s;hing to gain all he could, and forgetting that his ma&s;ter's claim to that part of the e&s;tate was a little dubious, endeavour|ed to rack the rents of its tenants. He vi&s;ited them in per&s;on for that purpo&s;e, but only got a bloody no&s;e. Upon which he commenced an action of battery again&s;t the tenants; and they counter-&s;uited him by an indictment, for attempting, privately, to &s;teal from their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Will Whig, who had been well for &s;ome time, and had oppo&s;ed James Tory's new management, as u&s;ual, began to appear with great vehemence upon this occa&s;ion. He had not oppo&s;ed James, when he racked the tenant's rents on this &s;ide the river, becau&s;e he was affraid of the argument <HI>adverecundiam;</HI> and chiefly becau&s;e he was in hopes of hav|ing the management again, in which ca&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="107">the racked rents would have been u&s;eful to him, and his friends. But he &s;aw plainly that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, James had the wrong &s;ow by the tail; and that he was running a ri&s;k of lo&s;ing part of the e&s;tate by mere greedine&s;s.</P>
<P>As Will fore&s;aw, &s;o it came to pa&s;s. The tenants on the further &s;ide of the river, irri|tated by the tyrandic &s;pirit of James, de|clared that his management did not extend to that part of the e&s;tate. And, after a trouble|&s;ome law-&s;uit, James was non-&s;uited: and the tenants beyond the river were declared freeholders.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XVIII.</HI> How James and Will formed a coalition.</HEAD>
<P>IT might have been expected that this mor|tification would have been of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to James, by the abatement of his pride. But James was one of tho&s;e who, if they are pounded in a mortar, as &s;aith the holy &s;crip|ture, will be &s;till the &s;ame. He could not part with his high hor&s;e, not he.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="109">Will Whig had &s;till &s;o &s;trong a party, that he not a little embarra&s;&s;ed James in his ma|nagement. In fact their &s;quabbles had &s;uch an effect, that the tenants neglected their in|du&s;try; and nothing could be done for the benefit of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>A cunning fellow, called Solomon Caca|taba, ob&s;erving this, and that the wi&s;er &s;ort of the tenants were &s;ick both of James and Will, a&s;pired to the management him&s;elf. Repre&s;enting to the lord the di&s;atisfaction of the tenants, he procured a mandate appoint|ing him manager.</P>
<P>James and Will hearing of this, hung their ears; and James propo&s;ed to Will to have a meeting at a public hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110">After a hearty drink, and a game at cards, James addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus to Will: "It is truly ridiculous, my lad, for you and me to &s;truggle about the management, and thus give an up&s;tart an opportunity to out wit us both. Suppo&s;e we form a coalition, and agree to manage jointly; there will be enough for both; at lea&s;t, our profits will be better than none at all, as We have now."</P>
<P>Will a&s;&s;ented; and the coalition was formed.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence was that, by the in|fluence of their numerous followers, they &s;oon regained the management. But as James was &s;till the old man, and &s;ome of their mutual mea&s;ures were &s;ugge&s;ted, and followed out, by him; and e&s;pecially as Solomon Cacataba, who was a mountebank
<PB N="105" REF="111">of the fir&s;t order, had been very profu&s;e of cozening liquor, the tenants were di&s;con|tented.</P>
<P>This encouraged Hector Truboy, a fol|lower and di&s;ciple of Solomon Cacataba, but in faith a clever and good lad, to apply to the di&s;contented tenants, for a deputation to be &s;ent to the Lord, recommending him, Hector Truboy, as the propere&s;t per&s;on to manage the e&s;tate; &s;eeing that Solomon was rather di&s;liked, on account of his Je&s;uitic principles, and James and Will were &s;up|po&s;ed to be little better than old rogues. The tenants agreed; and further repre&s;ented that much was to be hoped from the youth of Hector Truboy, as not enured or experi|enced in vice.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112">The lord graciou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented, and Hector Truboy became manager. But the tenants were much di&s;appointed; for his advi&s;ers were chiefly the old friends of James Tory, and his mea&s;ures were, of cour&s;e, mo&s;tly tyrannical and capricious. He was, how|ever, rather fortunate: and good fortune in a general, or a mini&s;ter, is equivalent to great ability.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XX.</HI> The birth and education of Jack Common-good.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time Jack Common-good began to make a &s;tir upon the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Jack was the &s;on of parents in a moderate &s;ituation of life, neither poor nor rich: but what they had was independent. He was from his infancy a remarkable &s;hy boy; fond of retirement, and of doing, good un&s;een. He &s;eemed always lo&s;t in thought; and with all Will Whig's frankne&s;s, and goodne&s;s of
<PB N="112" REF="118">heart, he had more &s;olidity and &s;edatene&s;s. Money he put no value upon, except to give away in charity.</P>
<P>Having lo&s;t his father and mother very early in life, he was trained up by a cruel uncle, a relation of Will Whig's. Jack profited as all do in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; and, with all the abilities of Will Whig, had a humility the mo&s;t profound. When Jack began to promi&s;e great things, James Tory pretended that he was his relation: but this Jack always denied; and indeed he had not a particle of James Tory's cunning, or tyranny.</P>
<P>All Jack's &s;tudies centered in the doing of good to his fellow creatures. He was well ver&s;ed in cla&s;&s;ical learning; but he &s;aid that he would prefer one good action to all the
<PB N="113" REF="119">learning in the world. And he proved that he did not &s;peak in vain.</P>
<P>He would often a&s;&s;ert that mankind were complete ma&s;ters of every art, except the only one which they ought to prefer to all; the art of bettering them&s;elves, and the &s;o|ciety they live in.</P>
<P>The Italian proverb, that 'opinion is the queen of the world,' plea&s;ed him much; and he often wi&s;hed that the reign of this fan|ta&s;tic queen were at an end, and Rea&s;on en|throned king in her place.</P>
<P>A conqueror he always termed a butcher; and affected great contempt for war, except in &s;elf-defence, or in defence of freedom. With the French morali&s;t, he laughed at the madne&s;s of mankind, who e&s;teem a &s;word,
<PB N="114" REF="120">which de&s;troys men, a badge of honour and decoration, while the in&s;trument which cre|ates men is an object of &s;hame.</P>
<P>He would &s;ay that the happine&s;s of man|kind depended &s;olely upon the rectitude of their opinions: and while their opinions were fal&s;e, they would ever be mi&s;erable. 'Can that country be wi&s;e, or happy, where a &s;oldier is a title of honour, and a mechanic a term of contempt? Nobility &s;hould attend utility. I know no real nobles, except the mechanic and the farmer. But mankind will always honour &s;hadows, and neglect the &s;ub&s;tance. Tho&s;e nations who adore the &s;un have &s;ome excu&s;e: but how numerous are they who wor&s;hip wooden idols, of their own making; and are &s;truck with awe at the finery with which they them&s;elves have dre&s;t them!'</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="121">In &s;uch paradoxes did Jack indulge. They at fir&s;t attracted notice, merely by their no|velty; but the more they were examined, the more &s;olid they were found. The tenants began to be much plea&s;ed with Jack; and to &s;ay that, to this vigour of youth, he added more than the wi&s;dom of age.</P>

<P>At one of the&s;e meetings, which James Tory and Will Whig regularly attended, they jointly propo&s;ed an important &s;cheme, in outward appearance for the good of the
<PB N="117" REF="123">e&s;tate; but which, in reality, would only have terminated in lodging a good &s;um o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> money in their pockets. Jack &s;aw through this immediately; and ri&s;ing up, addre&s;&s;ed them in the&s;e terms:</P>
<P>"Gentlemen, I honour you both equally. You James Tory have done harm to the e&s;tate; and you Will Whig have done it little good. Even when detached from each other, your admini&s;trations re&s;embled each other &s;o nearly, that all the tenants &s;aw that a change of men was not a change of mea|&s;ures. To load the tenants with taxes, and corrupt them with bribery, were the leading objects of both. Do you really &s;uppo&s;e gentlemen, that the tenants will be your dupes for ever? Do you not know that they &s;ee through your &s;chemes? If you mu&s;t de|ceive us, do not at lea&s;t in&s;ult our under|&s;tandings.

<P>JAMES and Will were at fir&s;t quite angry with Jack; and, by means of their adherents, gave him &s;o many mortifications, that Jack thought proper to retire to Frankland, a neighbouring e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Here Jack was &s;urpri&s;ed with a very odd &s;cene: for Frankland, which had been long oppre&s;t by bad management, had all of a &s;udden become one of the free&s;t e&s;tates in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">This was owing entirely to the &s;pirit of the tenants, which long oppre&s;&s;ion had rou&s;|ed into a flame. They had &s;eized upon the management them&s;elves; and made a new code of rules, to determine all que&s;tions by, concerning the management. The public good was to be the only law. Tithes were aboli&s;hed; and the imprudent power and claims of the richer annihilated. They would allow of no nobility, but that of merit; and all men were to be equal as God made them.</P>
<P>Some heads had been broken upon the oc|ca&s;ion. But what is the death of a few men, to the good of thou&s;ands, and the de&s;cend|ants of three thou&s;ands? Never had &s;uch a revolution been accompli&s;hed with as little blood&s;hed. Jack ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that it was &s;eldom the public good could be accom|pli&s;hed without broken heads. That a little

<P>Jack was glad to find &s;ome of his own &s;chemes realized; and &s;till happier to reflect that, to &s;et his fellow-tenants to rights, there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch extremities. 'Let us,' &s;aid he, 'put an effectual &s;top to bribery, re&s;orm our old laws, agree what tenants are to be invited to the meetings, in&s;i&s;t upon the tenants being mentioned fir&s;t in all &s;olemn deeds, in&s;tead of the manager, and &s;ome other matters, and we &s;hall do very|well.'</P>

<P>JAMES and Will, finding that they could not regain the confidence of the tenants, and ob&s;erving that Jack was very popular among them, generou&s;ly agreed to &s;erve their wi&s;hes by inviting him back, and lending him all their influence to procure the management.

<P>JACK began his management, by reforming the meetings of the tenants. Hitherto the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;ome ruinous farm hou&s;es had been permitted to &s;it at the meetings, and to vote as the re&s;t; and as they were very poor, James and Will had ea&s;ily bribed them to &s;upport any mea&s;ure they plea&s;ed.

<P>He moreover made &s;uch effectual laws again&s;t bribery, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him&s;elf, or any future manager, to u&s;e it. He thus &s;ecured a meeting, in which the members could have no private intere&s;t to &s;erve, except that of the public good.</P>
