<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am under a nece&s;&s;ity of giving a preface to the following work, I &s;hall, in the language of our immortal countryman, <HI>imitate the</HI> ROMANS <HI>in brevity,</HI> as <HI>brevity is the &s;oul of wit;</HI> and not be &s;o &s;tudious of the nece&s;&s;ary ornaments of &s;tile, as of relating FACTS, with the unbia&s;s'd integrity of a faithful and impartial hi&s;torian. This I have thought fit to premi&s;e, that the reader may not imagine he is running over a jumble of <HI>facts and fiction;</HI> &s;ince it is but too common, with modern authors of the poetical ca&s;t, to lard their prefaces with a &s;et of <HI>ingenious</HI> flouri&s;hes, which carry a greater air of rhodomontade than truth.</P>
<P>The following tragedy was originally written in <HI>Italian,</HI> by the celebrated Signior FUNIDOSO DELL'ARUNDO, formerly a rope|maker in <HI>Civita Vecchia;</HI> from which place he prudently retir'd, to avoid the addre&s;&s;es of the lady INQUISITION, who had a &s;trange hankering after his per&s;on, on account of his libertini&s;m in reli|gion; for, though a <HI>Catholic</HI> in appearance, he was a <HI>Lutheran</HI> at heart. In the year 1751 he arrived in <HI>London,</HI> with that theatrical family of <HI>Italians,</HI> who gave the town &s;uch exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, in the performance of &s;everal incomparable <HI>burlettas,</HI> all, or mo&s;t of which, are &s;aid (with what truth I will not venture to a&s;certain, as I am writing a narrative of FACTS) to be the production of our <HI>hempen genius.</HI></P>
<P>In the following year, which the reader, without my chrono|logical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will be able to di&s;cover to be the year 1752, Signior DELL'ARUNDO took &s;hipping for <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> with an inten|tion of re&s;iding in that part of the world, on account of the cheap|ne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and accordingly &s;ettled in a &s;ea port about thirty miles to the &s;outhward of that place. He had not been many months in his new re&s;idence, till he married a widow, who was &s;omewhat pa&s;t the <HI>heyday of her blood;</HI> or, to &s;peak le&s;s poetically, pretty well &s;tricken in years; and before he had been a dozen moons in his alter'd &s;tate, to his great affliction, he lo&s;t his lady. I might here, according to the u&s;ual prolixity of hi&s;to|rians, take up my reader's time, by telling him of what di&s;temper the <HI>Signiora</HI> departed this life; but, as I don't intend to clog my narrative with <HI>u&s;ele&s;s matters,</HI> I &s;hall be totally &s;ilent on the occa|&s;ion: nay, I am &s;o great a lover of conci&s;ene&s;s in hi&s;tory, that I &s;hall not even &s;o far intrude on my candid reader's lei&s;ure, as to inform him that the lady died of a fit of the cholic.</P>
<P>As our <HI>Italian phoenomenon</HI> was a great admirer of poetry, it is no wonder, after he had acquir'd a competent knowledge of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> language, that he receiv'd &s;o &s;en&s;ible a plea&s;ure from the peru&s;al of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poets. He was &s;o captivated with the <HI>ma&s;terly &s;tyle and expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of our dramatic authors (e&s;pecially <HI>the more mo|dern
<PB N="iv" REF="4">ones)</HI> that he re&s;olv'd to collect the principal beauties in our language, and throw them into a tragedy, form'd on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plan, in his native tongue; which he at length &s;o happily exe|cuted, that his performance will <HI>undoubtedly</HI> be an honour to lite|rature in general, and to the <HI>Italian</HI> language in particular.</P>
<P>In <HI>October</HI> 1756, our celebrated foreigner departed this life; and, according to the phra&s;e of our diurnal &s;cribblers, <HI>univer&s;ally lamented by all his acquaintance;</HI> and as a perpetual monument of the friend&s;hip, which had long exi&s;ted between <HI>us,</HI> left his value|able performance to my care, in the following words contain'd in the body of his la&s;t will and te&s;tament.</P>
<P><HI>Item, I give and devi&s;e to my mo&s;t dear friend, brother bard, and brother rope-maker,</HI> JOSEPH REED, <HI>late of</HI> STOCKTON <HI>afore&s;aid, now of</HI> KING DAVID'S FORT, <HI>near</HI> Sun-Tavern-Fields, London, <HI>all and &s;ingular my piece, production, performance, drama, or tragedy, called</HI> MADRIGAL <HI>and</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note 1. in the Fir&s;t Act.</NOTE> TROLLETTA, <HI>with the prologue, epilogue, airs, odes, dirges, and all appurtenances thereunto belonging, or in any wi&s;e appertaining; to be tran&s;lated, alter'd, imitated, and made fit for the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>or other &s;tage, by him the &s;aid</HI> JOSEPH REED. <HI>I al&s;o will and require that the profits, ari&s;ing from the publication, or theatrical exhibition of the &s;aid tragedy, be applied and i&s;&s;ued to, and for the &s;ole u&s;e, intere&s;t, behalf, ad-vantage, and emolument of him the &s;aid</HI> JOSEPH REED, <HI>his heirs, executors, admini&s;trators, and a&s;&s;igns; only</HI> willing and requiring <HI>of him the &s;aid</HI> JOSEPH REED, <HI>after &s;uch tran&s;lation, alteration, or imitation is compleated, that the original</HI> at the &s;ole ex|pence of the &s;aid JOSEPH REED, <HI>may be &s;ent to the</HI> Vatican <HI>library at</HI> Rome, <HI>to be there pre&s;erv'd as a perpetual monument of my dra|matic genius.</HI></P>
<P>I have given this extract to prove my legal title to the Piece; for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, not with&s;tanding that clau&s;e in the <HI>bard's</HI> MAGNA CHARTA, call'd <HI>poetica licentia,</HI> I think it little le&s;s than down|right robbery, to rai&s;e any con&s;iderable &s;um from the tran&s;lation, or alteration of the works of an <HI>exotic</HI> brother, unle&s;s &s;uch brother, or his de&s;cendents, be admitted to go &s;nacks in the profits. I could wi&s;h that Mr. POPE had been of my opinion in this particular, but am &s;orry to tell the world he <HI>was not,</HI> which I think no &s;mall blemi&s;h in his character. It is univer&s;ally known this great, tho' little man, pocketed <HI>&s;ome thou&s;ands</HI> by his tran&s;lation of the works of MEONIDAS HOMER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the <HI>fine old Grecians;</HI> yet I could never learn (though I have made very &s;trict enquiry) that he had the gratitude or good manners, to &s;end even a bill of ex|change, or bank note of a cool hundred, to any of Mr. HOMER'S lineal de&s;cendents. I am aware that &s;ome of Mr. POPE'S advo|cates will be ready to bellow out, <HI>Zounds! the fellow's mad! Where the devil could be find &s;uch de&s;cendents?</HI> &mdash; But pray, gentle|men, why did not your admir'd <HI>little friend</HI> adverti&s;e in all the pub|lic papers in <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to effect &s;uch di&s;covery? In&s;tead of
<PB N="v" REF="5">this, I could never find he advertis'd at all. &mdash; Had he but even i&s;&s;ued out a notice to that purpo&s;e in our <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er only,</HI> I make no doubt but he would have had, within eight and forty hours of the publication, one or more claimants, who would have proved their lineal de&s;cent <HI>upon oath,</HI> which I think is as much &s;atisfaction, as any rea&s;onable per&s;on, who is not a downright in|fidel, would require. &mdash; But to return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>If it be plagiari&s;m, without benefit of clergy, to borrow a few lines from a native author, it is certainly as criminal to &s;teal whole plays from a foreigner. &mdash; When I reflect on the prevalency of this iniquitous practice, I am ready to fall down on my <HI>marrow|bones,</HI> to return my humble and hearty thanks to godde&s;s NATURE, for &s;o kindly di&s;qualifying me for the perpetration of &s;uch offence, by giving me the knowledge <HI>of one language only</HI> &mdash; The filching of plays, under cover of tran&s;lation, heaven knows, is a crime of no &s;hort &s;tanding &mdash; Nay, &s;ome of our countrymen have carried their villainy to a yet greater height, and &s;tole plays with little or no alteration at all. Among the&s;e abandon'd plagiaries, I am told, was AARON HILL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>of turgid, altering, and tran&s;lating memory.</HI> I have heard a report of his <HI>borrowing</HI> the tragedy of ZARA; and, as the &s;tory is in few hands, I &s;hall, by way of &s;e|cret, give it to my readers; at the &s;ame time mo&s;t earne&s;tly con|juring and requiring my &s;aid readers that it <HI>may go no further;</HI> for I would not be known to propagate any rumour, to the di&s;ad|vantage of an author, for who&s;e memory I have &s;o profound a veneration.</P>
<P>In the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &mdash; I have forgot what &mdash; Mr. THOMAS HUDSON, then an u&s;her to a grammar-&s;chool at <HI>Durham,</HI> now a clergyman in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> tran&s;lated Mon&s;. VOLTAIRE'S <HI>Zaire.</HI> On &s;ending &s;uch tran&s;lation to <HI>London,</HI> for the peru&s;al and examination of &s;ome connoi&s;&s;ieur in drama, it unfortunately fell into the hands of a con&s;iderable dealer in hats: this <HI>beaverite</HI> having a more delicate ta&s;te in the <HI>out&s;ide,</HI> than <HI>in|&s;ide</HI> ornaments of a <HI>head,</HI> gave the piece to a friend for &s;uch exa|mination; by means of which friend poor Mi&s;s <HI>Zara</HI> fell into the hands of the afore&s;aid poetical ravi&s;her, AARON, who
<Q><L>Crop'd this fair ro&s;e, and rifled all its &s;weetne&s;s,</L>
<L>Then ca&s;t it, like a loath&s;ome weed, away.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Otway's Orph.</HI></BIBL></Q> that is, in plain pro&s;e, pilfer'd the copy; and, the better to con|ceal the theft, gave out that <HI>the piece was ab&s;olutely unfit for the &s;tage;</HI> but, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch in&s;inuation, in that, or the follow|ing &s;ea&s;on, Mi&s;s <HI>Zara</HI> was thrown upon the town, and receiv'd with univer&s;al applau&s;e. It is true the play, <HI>in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e,</HI> could not be HUDSON'S, as HILL had mi&s;plac'd <HI>a &s;ingle &s;cene,</HI> and made the <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> alteration of <HI>fifty lines or upwards,</HI> by which the property (according to modern authors' latitudinarian notions of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum) undoubtedly</HI> became his own&mdash;The above anec|dote I had from Mr. HUDSON; wherefore if brother AARON'S
<PB N="vi" REF="6">gho&s;t know it to be a fib, I humbly de&s;ire the &s;aid gho&s;t to take a trip into the <HI>north,</HI> and confront the &s;ermonizer. I &s;hall not pretend to a&s;certain the truth of this charge, but only offer, as my private opinion, <HI>on the &s;ide of the church,</HI> that the &s;tiles of the <HI>Engli&s;h Zara</HI> and <HI>Merope,</HI> (both the &s;ame author's in <HI>French)</HI> are almo&s;t as different, as tho&s;e of <HI>Jane Shore</HI> and <HI>Irene.</HI></P>
<P>After this digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall lay before the public my embar|ra&s;&s;ments concerning this tragedy. Signior DELL'ARUNDO had un|fortunately forgot, that his <HI>mo&s;t dear friend</HI> under&s;tood no human language but that of his mother tongue: however, that no pains might be wanting, on my &s;ide, to do as much honour as I could to the production of my decea&s;ed brother, I got one of the <HI>Opera-Tran&s;lators</HI> to give me the piece in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but alas! the ver&s;ion was <HI>&s;o very &s;ublime,</HI> that I could not po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand any three lines of it together. After this I employ'd my friend, PETER RONE, profe&s;&s;or of languages, to give me a literal tran&s;lation, which an&s;wer'd my purpo&s;e &s;o well, that I was able to trace many of the beauties, our foreigner had borrow'd from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> play|wrights. Where the context would allow, I have given the many <HI>&s;triking</HI> pa&s;&s;ages in the very dre&s;s of the re&s;pective authors, from whom they were undoubtedly borrow'd: where the text would not allow me &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in the very words, I have by parody, or imitation, kept as near the <HI>&s;ublime originals</HI> as I po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Signior DELL'ARUNDO, in a codicil to his will, hath al&s;o left me, &s;ubject to the afore&s;aid conditions, the farther legacy of three plays, viz. one Comedy and two Tragedies, called the <HI>Contra&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s'd Prince&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s'd Wife.</HI> The Comedy is thought to be a tolerable piece; but as to the Tragedies, I mu&s;t own I think them greatly inferior to the following work. They have no <HI>triumphal entries,</HI> ROMAN <HI>ovations, &s;acrifices, dirges, proce&s;&s;ions, gho&s;ts, drums, trumpets, thunder, lightning, battles, miraculous revo|lutions</HI> (&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, according to Mr. BAYES'S rule, to ELEVATE and SURPRIZE) or any of that <HI>&s;ublime rant,</HI> which may be call'd the very &s;oul of modern tragedy. In &s;hort, they have nothing but na|ture, propriety, and &s;implicity of fable and diction to recommend them. I have been advis'd to lard them plentifully with the above <HI>tragic artillery;</HI> but, &s;o deprav'd is my ta&s;te, that I cannot li&s;ten to &s;uch innovation: I rather chu&s;e to wait till <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> come into play again on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;tage. In the mean time, if the town have a de&s;ire to &s;ee the theatrical exhibition of the &s;aid pieces; and the &s;aid town can or will rai&s;e me a patron, that hath influence &s;ufficient to procure their repre&s;entation, <HI>one,</HI> or <HI>more</HI> of the &s;aid pieces &s;hall be at the &s;ervice of the public in the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>That nothing might be wanting to render the following pro|duction as entertaining as po&s;&s;ible, I have prevailed on my learn|ed and ingenious friend, Dr. HUMBUG, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in writing annotations to the piece.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">I can hardly conclude this preface, without an intimation of the excellency of Mr. DAVIS in the character of BUCKRAMO. I hope his <HI>voice, figure</HI> and <HI>abilities for the &s;tage</HI> will, in the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, intitle him to the regard of the Public on a PATENT THEATRE.</P>

<BIBL>Dr. HUMBUG.</BIBL></NOTE> Was thy maje&s;tic eye-beam clos'd in gin;</L>
<L><NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">In the 18th century, the inhabitants of <HI>Great Britain</HI> were very much addicted to drinking a liquid, call'd <HI>Geneva;</HI> or, ac|cording to its u&s;ual abbreviation, <HI>gin,</HI> which was a &s;low, but &s;ure poi&s;on. They &s;wallow'd it, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do opium, meerly for the &s;ake of intoxication. The con&s;umption of this liquid was &s;o great, that &s;ome thou&s;ands of <HI>poi&s;oners general,</HI> di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by the <HI>mode&s;t</HI> appellation of <HI>di&s;tillers,</HI> got their liveli|hood; nay, &s;ome of them ama&s;s'd immen&s;e fortunes by the com|po&s;ition of this inebriating &s;pirit. So great was the &s;kill of the&s;e chymical poi&s;oners, that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from molo&s;&s;es, juniper-berries, turpentine; nay, I be|lieve, had they &s;et about it, from the upper leathers of old &s;hoes; but the chief, and mo&s;t benefical principles, from which they could po&s;&s;ibly draw this fatal juice, were wheat, barley, or other grain. In the years 1757 and 1758, on account of the real, or artificial &s;carcity of grain in <HI>England,</HI> the&s;e gentry were pro|hibited the u&s;e of it, which &s;o affected the di&s;tillery, that, hap|pily for the nation, &s;everal of its profe&s;&s;ors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades, and launch into le&s;s de&s;tructive cal|lings. During &s;uch prohibition it was remark'd, that human excrement, both <HI>a priori</HI> and <HI>a po&s;teriori</HI> bore an advanced price, which might probably ari&s;e from the u&s;e of the&s;e fragrant mate|rials in di&s;tillery. This conjecture is not at all unnatural, as <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>porter,</HI> after they have undergone the internal opera|tions, mu&s;t &s;till retain &s;ome remaining part of their <HI>wheaten</HI> and <HI>malten</HI> qualities. For my part, I am almo&s;t confirm'd in this opinion, from the near analogy of flavour between <HI>gin,</HI> and that more <HI>&s;olid</HI> &s;pecies of excrement, on which the <HI>honours of knight|hood</HI> hath been time immemorial conferr'd. After &s;o long a note, it will be almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to prove the truth and pro|priety of our author's &s;tiling <HI>gin,</HI> the <HI>bli&s;s and bane of human life;</HI> e&s;pecially as drunkenne&s;s &s;eems to be the primary happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent age.

<L>HEaven's! 'tis a fearful night!<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Many of our tragic authors have judiciou&s;ly u&s;her'd in a dreadful night, by way of prologue or preparative to the cata|&s;trophe of their plays. Such preparative &s;eldom fails of &s;uc|ce&s;s, as it throws a gloomy melancholy o'er the mind, and ren|ders the reader, or audience, more &s;u&s;ceptible of the en&s;uing di&s;tre&s;s of the performance. It further &s;erves to heighten the character of the hero, or heroine; for certainly nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the dignity and importance of any per&s;o|nage, than when we are convinced, that even nature it&s;elf is mourning the impending fall of her favourites.</NOTE></L>

<BIBL><HI>Macbeth.</HI></BIBL>
<P>As I intend in a few months to give the world a compleat edition of SHAKESPEAR'S works, in twenty volumes in folio, it may not, in this place, be ami&s;s to give a &s;pecimen of my cri|tical abilities. My 475th note on the tragedy of <HI>Macbeth</HI> runs thus:
<Q><P>Though all the &s;tream of editions concur in reading,
<Q><L>Or el&s;e my &s;word with an unbatter'd edgr,</L>
<L>I'll &s;heath again undeeded. &mdash;</L></Q>
yet I am per&s;uaded our immortal poet, who never wrote a line of fu&s;tian in his life, could not be guilty of &s;uch a turgid expre&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall therefore propo&s;e three &s;everal readings, one of which our poet certainly wrote:
<Q>1. <L>Or el&s;e my &s;word with an <HI>un&s;patter'd</HI> edge,</L>
<L>I'll &s;heath again <HI>un&s;peeded.</HI>&mdash;</L></Q>
as if he had &s;aid, <HI>or el&s;e my &s;word, with edge</HI> un&s;prinkled, <HI>or</HI> un&s;mear'd, <HI>with human gore, I'll &s;heath again</HI> un&s;peeded, <HI>i. e.</HI> un&s;ucce&s;sful.
<Q>2. <L>Or el&s;e my &s;word, with an <HI>unbattled</HI> edge,</L>
<L>I'll &s;heath again <HI>unbleeded &mdash; that is,</HI> unbloody.</L></Q>
<Q>3. <L>Or el&s;e my &s;word, with <HI>man-unbatten'd</HI> edge,</L>
<L>I'll &s;heath again <HI>in dead hide.</HI> &mdash;</L></Q>
q. d. <HI>or el&s;e my &s;word, with edge</HI> unbatten'd, <HI>or</HI> unfatten'd with man, <HI>or</HI> the blood of man, <HI>I'll &s;heath again</HI> in dead hide; that is, in the &s;cabbard. To illu&s;trate this image more fully, it may not be ami&s;s to add, that &s;cabbards are generally made of <HI>dead hides,</HI> or leather. I am apt to think, from the analogy of &s;ound between <HI>in dead hide,</HI> and <HI>undeeded,</HI> that &s;uch corruption hath crept into the text.</P> <BIBL>Dr. HUMBUG.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE></L>

<L><NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">This tragedy originally ended with the line,
<Q>Forbids the holy rites of funeral &mdash;</Q> on which the punning critick before-mention'd ob&s;erv'd, it was an <HI>immoral</HI> play. Our author took the hint, but could not be prevailed on to annex a moral. I expo&s;tulated with him, in the mo&s;t friendly manner, on the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch termination of the play; but he very <HI>ob&s;tinately</HI> and <HI>whim&s;ically</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that a moral, unle&s;s drawn up in the epilogue, was unnatural, be|cau&s;e it is an immediate addre&s;s to the audience; which audi|dience, the <HI>&s;peaker,</HI> in his dramatic character, cannot with pro|priety &s;uppo&s;e to be pre&s;ent &mdash; that it could not properly be &s;poken by any of the per&s;ons in the drama, unle&s;s &s;uch per|&s;on had been pre&s;ent during the whole repre&s;entation, and was con&s;equently acquainted with every incident in the play &mdash; that it was an affront to an audience, to &s;uppo&s;e them inca|pable of drawing a moral from the repre&s;entation &mdash; that it was a modern cu&s;tom, and, in his opinion,
<Q><L>More honour'd in the breach, than the ob&s;ervance.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Hamlet.</HI></BIBL></Q> that many judicious authors had &s;hewn their di&s;like of &s;uch prac|ti&s;e, particularly GAY, who &s;everely &s;atiriz'd it in his ingenious and pithy epilogue to the <HI>What d'ye call it,</HI> viz.
<Q><L>Our &s;tage-play has a moral, and no doubt</L>
<L>You all have wit enough to find it out.</L></Q> and finally, that our immortal SHAKESPEAR &s;eldom or never concluded any of his plays with a moral.
<P>He was &s;o ob&s;tinate on the occa&s;ion, that it was with no &s;mall difficuity I could prevail on him to &s;uffer me to annex the foregoing moral; which the reader may perceive is taken, with &s;light alteration, from the mo&s;t fini&s;h'd tragedy, that any language hath yet produced, I mean Mr. ADDISON'S <HI>Cato.</HI></P>
<P>As I have now ended my annotations, and occa&s;ionally &s;cat|ter'd a few <HI>encomia</HI> on the play, it will be naturally expected I &s;hould give my &s;ummary opinion of its merits, which I &s;hall deliver, not &s;o much with the candour of the friend, as the impartiality of the critick. I &s;hall divide the &s;ubject of my remarks into three heads, viz. the fable, the manners, and the diction.</P>
<P>As to the fable &mdash; but it had quite &s;lipt my memory, that the printer's boy hath been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the fini&s;hing note, wherefore I mu&s;t defer my critici&s;m, till the next edition of this tragedy.</P>
