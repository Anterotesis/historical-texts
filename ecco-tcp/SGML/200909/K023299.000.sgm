<P>MR PERCIVAL opened the pleadings on the part of the Crown. He &s;aid, this was an Information again&s;t Thomas Paine, for that he being a per&s;on of a wicked, malicious, and &s;editious di&s;po&s;ition; and wi&s;hing to in|troduce di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and to cau&s;e it to be be|lieved, that the Crown of this kingdom was contrary to the Rights of the Inhabitants of this kingdom; and to cau&s;e it to be believed al&s;o, that the Bill of Rights was a Bill of Wrongs and In&s;ults; all tending to bring the Government of this Country into contempt, and endeavouring to cau&s;e it to be believed, that the Par|liament of this country was openly corrupt in the face of day; and in order to withdraw the affections of the people of this kingdom, again&s;t the Law and Con&s;titution of this country, that the THOMAS PAINE, wi&s;hing and intending this mi&s;chief, did, on the 16th of Feb|ruary, 1791, wickedly, fal&s;ely, maliciou&s;ly, &s;canda|lou&s;ly, and &s;editiou&s;ly publi&s;h a certain book, called the Second Part of Rights of Man, &s;igned THOMAS PAINE, containing many fal&s;e, wicked, &s;candalous, malicious, and &s;editious a&s;&s;ertions; with which he would not trouble the Jury, as they would have them from the Attorney General. The Defendant had pleaded Not Guilty, upon which i&s;&s;ue was joined.</P>
<P>The ATTORNEY GENERAL &s;aid, the Jury would per|mit him to &s;tate, in this &s;tage of the proceeding, that in his mind a cau&s;e, which brought its own merit with it, a cau&s;e more plain, more clear, more certain, and indi&s;|putable, never came before a Court. Was it not that certain circum&s;tances had happened, and contributed to make the book in que&s;tion an object of con&s;iderable magnitude, and rendered it important, he &s;hould at once propo&s;e reading the pages of the book, as they were in|cluded in the information to the Jury, and then have left the ca&s;e to be di&s;po&s;ed by their good &s;en&s;e; but the particular mi&s;chief that naturally flowed from this wicked publication, had rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to open the ca&s;e in a fuller way than u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. To &s;peak of him&s;elf was what he had no delight in, and what could not be entertaining to the Jury; but as circum&s;tances made it nece&s;&s;ary, he hoped the Jury would forgive it. A rum our had been &s;pread
<PB N="3" REF="4">that this pro&s;ecution did not corre&s;pond with his private judgment. To this he an&s;wered, that if he did not think this a fit object for pro&s;ecution, he &s;hould think &s;uch an opinion di&s;qualified him from holding the office he now filled, he would be degraded in the e&s;timation of very profe&s;&s;ional man, and he ought to be de&s;pi&s;ed if he felt any unwillingne&s;s to bring this enormous ca&s;e before a Jury of this Country.</P>
<P>This was not the fir&s;t of the kind which this Defen|dant had thought fit to publi&s;h again&s;t Government. He was not, perhaps, warranted in not bringing the fir&s;t before the Gentlemen of the Jury. He pa&s;&s;ed it by, however, as it was u&s;hered into the world in that &s;hape, that it was likely to fall only into the hands of tolerably informed per&s;ons, who would have the &s;en&s;e to &s;ee the poi&s;on, and con&s;equently would be able to apply the antidote, and refute it as they went along: but when another appeared in a &s;maller &s;ize, printed on white brown paper, and thru&s;t in the hands of all per|&s;ons, of all ages, &s;exes, and conditions: they were even wrapped up with &s;weet meats for children. Such were the &s;teps that had been taken to forward this pub|lication, and he did what his duty demanded of him, he filed an information again&s;t the Defendant the fir&s;t day of the &s;ucceeding term, putting the que&s;tion upon record, which they, the Jury, had to try.</P>
<P>What it was that was the intention of this man by the&s;e publications, would not be matter of difficulty for the Jury to di&s;cover; it was manife&s;ted by every te&s;t that could apply to the explanation of a man's intention, and the Jury would have to &s;ay, whether they were not &s;atisfied that the whole of the book in que&s;tion did not de&s;erve the blame which had been imputed to it by the information. It was written with a view to vilify, de|grade, and to bring into abhorrence and contempt all the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this country in all the departments of the &s;tate. The whole of the book, the Jury would &s;ee, was artfully written for the purpo&s;e for which it was intended, namely, to make the lower orders of &s;ociety di&s;affected to Government, and it was the mo&s;t gro&s;s artifice that ever impo&s;ed upon the credulous part of mankind. It was all written in the dogmatical man|ner
<PB N="4" REF="5">It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;o many ready-made propo&s;itions, without regard to truth, and without the lea&s;t applica|tion to circum&s;tances, and al&s;o without the lea&s;t rea|&s;oning or deduction whatever; addre&s;&s;ed to men who were very properly anxious about their rights, but who, from too little knowledge of our Con&s;titution, and from being too little habituated to reflection, were ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon by &s;hallow artifice; and when the&s;e hone&s;t, but deluded men, came to be per&s;uaded that they were deprived, by the de&s;potic temper of Go|vernment, of Rights, to which they were clearly in|titled, it was a matter of no wonder they &s;hould mani|fe&s;t an abhorrence of the whole fabric. He defied any man to &s;hew a &s;y&s;tem capable of creating more mi&s;|chief than this book. It &s;tated that the regular &s;y&s;tem of our legi&s;lation was inherently corrupt, and that the whole formed a ma&s;s of abominable tyranny. Second|ly, that the Legi&s;lature altogether was, without a &s;in|gle exception, grounded upon u&s;urpation; that this u&s;urped authority framed what was called law, but that in reality there was &s;carcely &s;uch a thing as law in the country. Thus ten or twelve millions of people were told they were governed by u&s;urpation, and that of cour&s;e, as there was no &s;uch thing as law, each indi|vidual would be left to govern all his actions by his own partial notions of moral duty. Were we, indeed, to follow the&s;e doctrines?&mdash;Were we to fall into a law|le&s;s banditti? Were we to be reduced back again into a &s;avage &s;tate of nature, where man was the enemy of man, where all his faculties were u&s;ele&s;s, except &s;trength and cunning?&mdash;Were we to return to this &s;tate?&mdash;The Jury knew what the an&s;wer was to the&s;e que&s;tions. What was to be &s;aid to a man who would thus, with a general &s;weep, take away all law, or the force of all law, by a&s;&s;erting that all laws which had been hitherto made, are null and void; this &s;ort of ar|tifice was very gro&s;s, it was true, but it did not appear &s;o to tho&s;e who could not detect the artifice. Objec|tions too were &s;tarted in this book to <HI>Monarchy,</HI> in ge|neral terms, without one word being &s;aid of its <HI>advan|tages.</HI> The power of the <HI>Ari&s;tocracy</HI> was objected to, but not a word was &s;aid about the <HI>Democratic</HI> part of
<PB N="5" REF="6">our Con&s;titution. It was well known that England had a powerful Democracy; but not a word of that, becau&s;e it would not make the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people di&s;|contented; this was the common artifice; an artifice &s;o very &s;hallow, that &s;ome people might wonder perhaps at the &s;ucce&s;s of it; but to whom were the&s;e things ad|dre&s;&s;ed? to the ignorant, the credulous, and the de&s;pe|rate&mdash;the latter were naturally the enemies of all go|vernment, order, or regularity; every re&s;taint was irk|&s;ome to them, and nothing was &s;o plau&s;ible or convinc|ing to them, even upon the point of propriety, as to in|form them we &s;hall have no government at all; the others were ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed upon, and made the dupes of the crafty and de&s;igning, who might chu&s;e to deceive them.</P>
<P>The Jury, in order to judge accurately of the merits of this political performance, would take into their con|&s;ideration, the phra&s;es and manner in which the author was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s his thoughts in this publication: the manner was &s;neering and contemptuous; and, as to the matter, he called it an utterdefiance to all law, mora|lity, and religion. The indecency with which Monarchy was treated was quite &s;hocking, and the conclu&s;ions in that work, upon that topic, di&s;covered that the author was de&s;titute of knowledge, as to the various provi&s;ions, and wi&s;e ones too, which the law made in that particular.&mdash; Here the learned Gentleman entered into an hi&s;torical de|tail of the various permanent Council for Minor Kings, Regents, hereditary and official advi&s;ers, &amp;c. of the Throne, in various ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o that the provi&s;ions by law were &s;uch, that no material inconvenience could be &s;u&s;tained by the public on account of the monarchical &s;y&s;tem&mdash;a &s;y&s;tem which Mr. Paine had been plea&s;ed to &s;ay was &s;uch, that a ca&s;e might occur where there would be a complete cha&s;m in that branch of our form of go|vernment. The truth was, that our Con&s;titution was the be&s;t upon earth, and that for the plaine&s;t and cleare&s;t rea&s;on&mdash;it had had longer time for melioration than that of any other in the world. Seven hundred years ago freedom was its ba&s;is. From the days of Julius Cae&s;ar it had from age to age been improved, until it was com|pleted at the Revolution.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<P>He apprehended it to be no difficult operation of the human mind, to di&s;tingui&s;h rea&s;oning from a deliberate de&s;ign to withdraw men's minds from the Con&s;titution; it was done by the operation of good &s;en&s;e, and not dif|ficult for a Jury of the city of London. They would ob&s;erve, whether the whole of the book was not calcu|lated to convince the &s;ober part of mankind, or to pro|duce di&s;affection, to inflame pa&s;&s;ions in&s;tead of rea&s;on|ing with the mind. He knew of no circum&s;tance that could leave a doubt in the mind of the Jury as to what was pa&s;&s;ing in the heart of the Defendant, at the time he penned this publication.</P>
<P>He had thought it more becoming, as well as benefi|cial to the public, to &s;elect out of this wicked work &s;ix or &s;even pa&s;&s;ages, than to encumber the record with too many recitals. He would now take them in their order:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age is to be found in page 21, large edi|tion, and is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>All hereditary Government is in its nature ty|ranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a Government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>Now what was the tendency of this? to de&s;troy all &s;ubordination and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law. It was neither more nor le&s;s than this; to hold out to the people of this country, that they were &s;laves; this was one of the&s;e &s;hort ready-made propo&s;itions, which, if a man be|lieves, he mu&s;t &s;ay, I can bear this no longer. As to the King's inheriting the people, that was a piece of &s;o|phi&s;try; he had no inheritance in the people, his inhe|ritance was his office, and that was an office under the law.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age is in page 47.</P>
<P><Q>This Convention met at Philadelphia, in May, 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected Pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected
<PB N="7" REF="8">with any of the State Governments, or with Con|gre&s;s. He delivered up his Commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived as a private Citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Convention went deeply into all &s;ubjects: and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;|tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;e|veral parts of a federal Con&s;titution; the next que&s;tion was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this purpo&s;e they did not, like a cabal of Courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a Ger|man Elector, but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>What was this? Why the whole was written for the &s;ake of introducing a &s;neer again&s;t a Dutch Stadtholder and German Elector, this di&s;covered the temper of the man; but it was another dogma or rea|dy-made propo&s;ition, without the lea&s;t deduction.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age was to be found in page 52.</P>
<P><Q>The hi&s;tory of the Edwards and the Hen|ries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many in&s;tances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to pa&s;s tho&s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all tho&s;e in&s;tances we hear nothing of a con&s;titu|tion, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this, another William, de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the lea&s;t; &s;ince, from circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation, it &s;aid, for <HI>your &s;hare</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the
<PB N="8" REF="9">ca&s;e, the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs, and of in&s;ult. As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the pur|po&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the time of William, a &s;pecies of Go|vernment aro&s;e, i&s;&s;uing out of this coalition bill of rights; and more &s;o, &s;ince the corruption intro|duced at the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the agency of Walpole; that can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de&s;potic legi&s;lation. Though the parts may embarra&s;s each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of it&s;elf, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the Con|&s;titution, either that gives, or that re&s;trained power?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not becau&s;e a part of the government is elective, that makes it le&s;s a de&s;poti&s;m, if the per|&s;ons &s;o elected po&s;&s;e&s;s afterwards, as a Parliament, unlimited powers. Election, in this ca&s;e, becomes &s;eparated from repre&s;entation, and the candidates are candidates for de&s;poti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>Thus this author would have us believe, that, from the days of the Edwards and the Henries, up to the Stuarts, we had nothing but tyranny; and the Bill of Rights, it &s;eemed, was a bill of wrongs and in&s;ults. Who was &s;o infatuated as to believe all this? Who among us was ignorant of the character of that great founder of our juri&s;prudence, Edward the Third. And as to the Bill of Rights, &s;trangely mu&s;t that heart be con&s;tituted, which had not a grate|ful reverence for the memory of tho&s;e who procured it. But as eulogium would be lo&s;t on that bill, let it &s;peak for it&s;elf.&mdash;Here he recited almo&s;t the whole of the Bill of Rights.&mdash;Such was the bill of wrongs and in&s;ults&mdash;he would not profane it by a comment.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age was in page 56.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<P><Q>The attention of the government of England (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince its poli|tical connection with Germany, to have been &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and, with re&s;pect to re|gular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>Here was a reflection of the mo&s;t wicked &s;ort on the government of this country, and an invitation to the people to rebel, by telling them there was &s;carcely &s;uch a thing as law in England.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age was a note in page 63.</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to the two hou&s;es, of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature to have no temper of its own. The Mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obe|dience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nick-named hou&s;e regarded, that the peo|ple &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the farthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>There was no occa&s;ion to defend the Hou&s;e, it al|ways had and has at this moment &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious men in Europe.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age was in pages 107 and 108.</P>
<P><Q>Having thus glanced at &s;ome of the defects of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, I proceed to what is called the Crown, upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e.</Q></P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P><Q>It &s;ignifies a nominal office of a million &s;ter|ling a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in re|ceiving the money. Whether the per&s;on be wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every mini&s;try acts upon the &s;ame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the peo|ple mu&s;t be hood-winked, and held in &s;uper&s;titious ignorance by &s;ome bug-bear or other; and what is called the Crown an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, and there|fore it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es to be expected from it. This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The hazard to which this office is expo&s;ed in all countries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation&mdash;the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>So that if the people of this country come into their &s;en&s;es, we &s;hall have no Crown.&mdash;We had been out of for &s;en&s;es for centuries, if this was the ca&s;e; and all he could wi&s;h was that we might remain lunatics for ever.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age was a note in page 116 and 117.</P>
<P><Q>I happened to be in England as the celebra|tion of the centenary of the Revolution of 1688. The character of William and Mary have always appeared to me dete&s;table; the one &s;eeking to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power them&s;elves; but the nation was di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that event. I felt hurt at &s;eeing it a&s;cribe the whole repu|tation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Fir&s;t acted the fame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private
<PB N="11" REF="12">profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern it&s;elf, is governed as a job. England has been the prey of jobs ever &s;ince the Revolution.</Q></P>
<P>The Attorney General made a few ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e &s;landers on William and Mary, and the whole of the Hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>The la&s;t pa&s;&s;age was in page 161.</P>
<P><Q>The fraud, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ition of govern|ments, are now beginning to be too well under|&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, in all countries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;&s;|ing for the funeral. Let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick for men, at the expence of a million a year, who under&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capacities would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of a pari&s;h con&s;table. If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Attorney General, after commenting able on the various pa&s;&s;ages adverted to, made &s;everal ob&s;er|vations on the great advantages derived from an here|ditary when compared to an elective Monarchy. This was manife&s;ted in the Con&s;titution of Poland, which obliged a great, a humane, and a worthy Prince to ab|dicate his throne. He then called the attention of the Jury, to arguments that had been urged again&s;t Mr. Paine's Rights of Man, by an American Gentleman of the name of Adams; he read &s;everal extracts out of this book, and &s;aid, the&s;e arguments &s;eemed to him to be complete an&s;wers to the Rights of Man&mdash;Having fini&s;h|ed his ob&s;ervations, he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to trou|ble the Gentlemen of the Jury further in this &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s. According as they &s;hould or &s;hould not
<PB N="12" REF="13">be of opinion that this book had a dangerous tendency, would be their verdict. He had done his duty by bringing an offender of this &s;ort before the Gentlemen of the Jury, and thereby putting the Public under the &s;hield of their protection.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Haynes</HI> was the fir&s;t witne&s;s called on the part of the pro&s;ecution; who &s;aid he had bought the Second Part of the Rights of Man on the 20th of February la&s;t, at the &s;hop of Mr. Jordan, No. 166, Fleet-&s;treet.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Chapman</HI> &s;aid he was a printer, and knew the defendant Thomas Paine. He was introduced to Mr. Paine by Mr. Thomas Chari&s;tie. He was introduced as a printer to print &s;ome books. In the year 1791 he printed the Fir&s;t part of the Rights of Man; he al&s;o printed part of the Second Part of the Rights of Man, to wit, to page 112, to &s;ignature <HI>H.</HI> He had the manu|&s;cript in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to p. 146, and had compo&s;ed as far as 140. But when &s;heet <HI>I</HI> came into his hands, up|on examining it, part of it appeared to have a danger|ous tendency. He then determined in his own mind not to proceed with the work. He wrote a &s;hort note to Mr. Paine for that purpo&s;e, and it was with a degree of reluctance that he did it, owing to the civilities he had received from Mr. Paine. An accident, however, occurred, which made this bu&s;ine&s;s ea&s;y. About the 16th of January Mr. Paine called on him, and was ra|ther intoxicated with liquor. He had been dining at Mr. John&s;on's, in St. Paul's Church-yard. Mr. Paine introduced a &s;ubject upon which they had often differed &mdash;that of religion, which was a favourite topic when he was intoxicated. The &s;ubject of debate running very high, Mr. Paine at la&s;t came to per&s;onal abu&s;e. An ob&s;ervation was made by Mrs. Chapman, at which Mr. Pain was greatly offended, and &s;aid he had not been &s;o much affronted in the whole cour&s;e of his life. He ro&s;e in a great pa&s;&s;ion, declaring that as the witne&s;s was a di&s;&s;enter, he had a bad opinion of him, as they were a &s;et of hypocrites. Mr. Paine told the witne&s;s he wi&s;h|ed to &s;ettle with him. He called on the witne&s;s the next morning, and made many apologies for what he had &s;aid; that it was the effect of liquor, and wi&s;hed him to go on with the work. But the witne&s;s would not, as he thought a part of it had an evil tendency.
<PB N="13" REF="14">He made three &s;eparate propo&s;als to Mr. Paine during the publication of this work; fir&s;t, he offered him 100 guineas for the copy; &s;econdly; he offered him 500 l. and, thirdly, he offered him 1000 guineas. He an&s;wer|ed, as he intended to publi&s;h a &s;mall edition of the work, that he wi&s;hed to re&s;erve it in his own hands.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s &s;aid he had &s;een Paine write, and thought he &s;hould know his hand writing. He looked at &s;everal letters &s;igned Thomas Paine, and be|lieved they were the hand-writing of the defendant. One of the&s;e letters empowered Mr. Jordan of Fleet-&s;treet, who was the publi&s;her of this work, to declare that if any per&s;on enquired who was the author of the work, to &s;ay, that he, Paine, was the author. Others of the&s;e letters were orders to Mr. Chapman to deliver copies of the Rights of Man to Mr. Jordan.</P>
<P><HI>John Perdue</HI> &s;aid, he was formerly acquainted with Mr. Paine when he was in the Exci&s;e, and before he went to America. A letter, was &s;hewn him, which Paine wrote to Archibald M'Donald, E&s;q. his Maje&s;ty's Attorney General. The witne&s;s &s;aid, he believed it was the hand-writing of Mr. Paine. This letter was dated Paris, Nov. 11th, fir&s;t year of the Republic.&mdash;There were pa&s;&s;ages in this letter, re|flecting on the Royal Family of England.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Er&s;kine</HI> objected to this letter being read in evidence, as it was not relevant to the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent trial. My Lord, &s;aid he, the Attorney General &s;tates, that it contains a Libel of the mo&s;t atrocious kind again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and his illu&s;|trious progeny; if &s;o, let him be pro&s;ecuted by another information.</P>
<P>It cannot prove any thing contained in the Se|cond Part of the Rights of Man, nor will be evi|dence whether any thing therein contained be libel|lous or not. The pre&s;ent Information charges nothing re&s;pecting this Letter, and Mr. Attorney General may aswell read any other work of Mr. Paine as this pretended Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Kenyon</HI> &s;aid, he felt the force of Mr. Er&s;kine's objection in the light which he put it, and he &s;hould certainly reject the Letter, if the Attorney General
<PB N="14" REF="15">had attempted to introduce it, either as matter of aggravation or inducement to the Jury to find the Defendant guilty on the pre&s;ent charge. But the Letter contained an avowal that Mr Paine was the Author of the Book which is the &s;ubject of this Trial; and as the Attorney General offered it only to prove this fact, he could not re&s;i&s;t its being read.</P>
<P>The Attorney General then &s;tated the &s;ub&s;tance of the letter; which was, that he wrote to the Attorney General as a Friend; that he had nothing to do with the trial him&s;elf. Whatever was the event, it could affect him in no other way than the increa&s;e of his reputa|tion; that it was not his trial, but a trial of the Engli&s;h Government with the people of England; that getting a verdict again&s;t him (which however would be diffi|cult except by a packed jury), was the &s;ame as a verdict again&s;t the man in the moon; that had he time when he was in England, he would have publi&s;hed the in|formation, with remarks upon it, but that now he would wait until the trial was over, and then he &s;hould have &s;ome ob&s;ervations. It &s;tated, that it was po&s;&s;ible for him to believe that Mr. Guelph, or any of his pro|fligate &s;ons, had not capacity to govern a nation.&mdash;In &s;tating this part, the Attorney General felt great emo|tion; he made &s;everal &s;uitable comments on it.&mdash;The letter then went on, &s;tating &s;everal other particulars, together with a reque&s;t that it might be read by the Attorney General to the Jury at the trial.</P>
<P>Several other letters were produced, all of which were proved to be the hand-writing of Mr. Paine&mdash; In &s;hort, there was no occa&s;ion for all the&s;e proofs, as nothing was denied upon the facts on the part of Mr. Paine by his council, except the letter to the Attorney General.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;ecution being thus clo&s;ed, <HI>Mr. Er&s;kine</HI> addre&s;&s;ed the Court as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>In that part of the Attorney General's addre&s;s in which he commented on the &s;ubject of a letter &s;tated to have been received from France, he did not appear
<PB N="15" REF="16">to me to play the actor, when he exhibited &s;igns of of emotion proceeding from feelings that did honour to his nature&mdash;from feelings which, animated by his duty, mu&s;t make him eager to expre&s;s his abhorrence of the direct and &s;candalous attack upon the honour of his Royal Ma&s;ter, and upon the character of his family. If his embarra&s;&s;ment was &s;o great, and if his feeling were &s;o deeply wounded, he will do me the ju&s;tice, that mine mu&s;t be equally, if not more deeply affected. In the high office which he holds, he mu&s;t feel the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty in correcting every imputation that may be thrown on the augu&s;t Per&s;onage whom he &s;erves; but that high Per&s;on|age is too far removed, too elevated above &s;ociety, for the learned Gentleman to enter into tho&s;e habits which beget the nicer &s;en&s;ibilities of the heart. I &s;tand in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the Attorney-Ge|neral, in re&s;pect of another augu&s;t and illu&s;trious Per&s;on, implicated in the mo&s;t improper manner in the forged letter which he has read; and in addition to my official &s;ituation, he has had the conde&s;cen&s;ion to admit me to the honour of his friend&s;hip, and there|fore I owe him, I feel for him, all the duty of a grateful &s;ervant, to an indulgent ma&s;ter; and all the affection which man can owe to man. What then mu&s;t be my embarra&s;&s;ment this day, I mu&s;t be without feelings and without affections, if I did not experience at this moment, the mo&s;t afflicting emotions. But great, though they are, they have not been able to detach me from the duty which I owe to my profe&s;&s;ion, to ju&s;tice, to honour, and to my country. Gentlemen, it is the fir&s;t and deare&s;t benefit of an Engli&s;hman, that he is intitled to an impartial trial. The author of the Rights of Man would have had ample ground of detraction, if there appeared the &s;malle&s;t tincture of partiality in the proceedings of this Court. If the man whom he had cho&s;en to defend him, had been inti|midated by threats&mdash;had been reduced by prejudice&mdash; had been prevailed upon in any way to abandon the cau&s;e, he might have had occa&s;ion to complain. It would, indeed, be a blur and a blot on our Con&s;ti|tution, if a man could &s;ay that the &s;lighte&s;t impedi|ment
<PB N="16" REF="17">was thrown in the way of ju&s;tice. I lament, therefore, that the Attorney-General thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to read that forged letter. If he knew it to be genuine and authentic, it was his duty to make it the &s;ubject of a di&s;tinct pro&s;ecution. It has nothing to do with the pre&s;ent trial. I feel the impre&s;&s;ion it has made on my own. But I &s;tand here as the advocate of Tho|mas Paine for the book that is the &s;ubject of the in|formation, and knowing how e&s;&s;ential it is to the character of Briti&s;h ju&s;tice that the Bar &s;hould be free, I will &s;till maintain what I conceive to be my pro|fe&s;&s;ional duty as far as nature can &s;truggle. That forged letter was admitted only under the pretext of its &s;erving to decypher the <HI>quo animo</HI> of the Author in writing the book. Granting even that it be a genuine letter, which I expre&s;sly deny, it has not the &s;malle&s;t tendency to e&s;tabli&s;h that fact. It was written months after the publication: nay, after the Author had withdrawn from his country; after a time when, from the treatment he received at Do|ver, he might con&s;ider him&s;elf as one expelled from his country. Granting, therefore, that the letter were genuine, it is immaterial; it is foreign to the pre&s;ent trial; and the Attorney-General has utterly failed in that which I contend to be e&s;&s;ential to a pro|&s;ecution, in pruducing evidence of the evil mind with which the Author wrote his book. No one fact, previous to the publication, has he &s;tated. No|thing to delineate the malignity, the wicked de&s;ign, the &s;editous &s;pirit with which the Author propagated his doctrines; nothing has he brought forward but this forged letter written &s;o many months after, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Attorney-General has &s;aid, that a rumour has gone abroad that the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution has been car|ried on without his approbation, and he has thought it nece&s;&s;ary to do away this impre&s;ion by &s;lating his direct concurrence. No one can be more ready than my&s;elf to do liberal ju&s;tice to the candour, impartiality, and fairne&s;s of the learned Gentleman. I have no doubt of the integrity with which he has brought even the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="17" REF="18">action; but if he felt him&s;elf a little embarra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e rumours, which at be&s;t mu&s;t have been heard only in a narrow circle, what mu&s;t be my &s;ituation this day? &s;tanding up as I do again&s;t prejudices that have been openly, widely, generally circulated&mdash;Again&s;t im|putations of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and the mo&s;t affecting kind&mdash; Gentlemen, you cannot be ignorant of the di&s;graceful means that have been taken, not merely to inflame the public mind again&s;t the Defendant, but to &s;tamp and brand every man with the mark and reproach of di&s;af|fection to the Government and Con&s;titution, who &s;hall venture to hazard the &s;lighte&s;t approbation of his doc|trines. Can you go into any places of public re&s;ort, either for plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, without hearing the cry again&s;t this man&mdash;without hearing every de&s;cription of per&s;ons who may be inclined to wi&s;h for the r&eacute;form of certain abu&s;es in the admini&s;tration of Government, confounded into one band of de&s;perate de&s;troyers of the Con&s;titution? Can you go into any of the&s;e places without &s;eeing the new&s;papers filled with the mo&s;t di|rect attacks upon my character, for having undertaken his defence, as if it were not the bounden duty of a profe&s;&s;ional man to exerci&s;e his faculties in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, impartially? Without making my&s;elf a party to the cau&s;e of my client, I hold my&s;elf bound to &s;tand up in his defence, and to take care that what|ever be the offence alledged again&s;t him, he &s;hall have all the benefits to be derived from the law, and from the pure admini&s;tration of it. I &s;ay, Gentlemen, that the Con&s;titution would be gone indeed, if the feelings, the foibles, the virtues, the caprices of Barri&s;ters were to be indulged, in the cau&s;es in which they take a a part.&mdash;What would be the con&s;equence of giving them an election? What would be the con&s;equence if it were to be permitted to a man high in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion to exerci&s;e his di&s;cretion in &s;tating what cau&s;es he would appear in, and in what not? Would it not be giving a previous judgment in the ca&s;e? Would it not be arrogating to him&s;elf the province of the Judge, and giving a colour and prejudice to the ca&s;e? I am &s;ure the Noble Lord will tell you, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the pure admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice,
<PB N="18" REF="19">that per&s;onal feelings &s;hould be permitted to weigh again&s;t public duty. I do not affect to hold my&s;elf out as a per&s;on &s;o high in the profe&s;&s;ion as that weight &s;hould be given to the authority of my example; but yet from my &s;tation at this Bar, I may &s;ay, without the im|putation of vanity, that it would be a flagrant breach of the integrity of the practice, detrimental and injurious to the character of the Bar, if I could be induced by any con&s;iderations to forego the defence of a client. I have, therefore, Gentlement, treated with the contempt that they merited, all the &s;arca&s;ms, all the calumnies, with which the conver&s;ation of companies, and the co|lumns of new&s;papers, have been loaded. Regardle&s;s of all that folly, and of all that malice, can utter, I &s;hall maintain until I die, the equal right of every man of this kingdom to a fair trial; and on this ground I &s;tand up to defend this book, and this author, as by the law of England he, and it, can be defended. It is my duty, Gentlemen, to &s;tate the Que&s;tion of this day. The Que&s;tion is not whether the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution be preferable to that of America, or that of France, for the common &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t uninformed per&s;on mu&s;t revolt at &s;uch an idea; for how can a Court, con&s;tituted by Engli&s;h Government and Engli&s;h law, give a deci|&s;ion again&s;t that which creates its authority and con|&s;titutes its juri&s;diction. It is not, therefore, the que&s;tion this day, to try whether the doctrines of this author are congenial with the Con&s;titution of England; nor whether they are doctrines oppo&s;ite to, and in ho&s;tility with, the Con&s;titution of England; but whether the book has been written and publi&s;hed agreeable to, and in conformity with, the law of the land.</P>
<P>I will make my&s;elf clearly under&s;tood&mdash;Suppo&s;e then that the doctrines of Thomas Paine were doctrines, Gentlemen, of which every one of you approved, and that I were now addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to a Jury of Repu|blicans, I &s;ay that you would not be authorized to give a verdict for the Defendant, if it &s;hould be made mani|fe&s;t to you, by the evidence, that he wrote the&s;e doc|trines, and publi&s;hed them for the malignant purpo&s;e of promoting an in&s;urrection in the country, thereby of|fending again&s;t the laws of the land; you have no juri&s;|diction
<PB N="19" REF="20">and authority but from law; you have no right to give a verdict in favour of a man offending again&s;t the law, becau&s;e you may happen to entertain opinions of the &s;ame kind which produced this breach of the law. This the Noble Lord will tell you from the Bench, and it is material for you to reflect upon this clear de&s;cription of your duty; for it matters not how perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with your opinions the doctrines might be; if they are contrary to the &s;pirit and letter of the law, you mu&s;t condemn. Were I therefore, as I &s;ay, addre&s;&s;ing a body of men who lived upon this book, of whom it was the &s;oul, who doated on it, as on an angel from heaven, I would &s;ay, Gentlemen, you cannot ac|quit this man if he has committed an offence again&s;t the law. It is not whether his opinion be your's; you are not to try his opinions, for the law has nothing to do with opinions; the law binds only conduct, it leaves opinion open. You mu&s;t &s;ee, therefore, what his con|duct has been, and &s;uffer not the congeniality of your opinions to blind and influence your judgment. This may be con&s;idered as a large conce&s;&s;ion, by &s;ome, as an artful manoeuvre by others; but I a&s;&s;ert, that it is a clear di&s;tinct de&s;cription of the office of the Jury; for, on the other hand, if you &s;hall di&s;approve of the doc|trines of Thomas Paine, if you &s;hall think that the Government of England has not the infirmities he im|putes to it, nay, that the pa&s;&s;ages of the book related by the Attorney General tend to injure that Con&s;titution, and to alienate the minds of the people of this country from the love of it; I &s;ay, that you cannot convict this man, unle&s;s you &s;hall be convinced that he has over|&s;tepped the Freedom of the Pre&s;s; for, Gentlemen, you mu&s;t look at the mind, you mu&s;t enquire whether he has written this book with an hone&s;t intention, from the genuine &s;entiments of his heart, and from a pure conviction that he was thereby promoting di&s;cu&s;&s;ions for the benefit of his fellow citizens; and this is to be collected from the matter on the record. If a man is to be judged on extrin&s;ic matter, that matter mu&s;t be brought into connection, and put upon the record, that the Jury may be able to judge of it, and that the De|fendant may have all the benefits of the law. What
<PB N="20" REF="21">crime then is charged upon this man?&mdash;That he has written and publi&s;hed this book, and that this book is ho&s;tile to the Con&s;titution of England?&mdash;No. The law of England knows no &s;uch crime. It mu&s;t be proved, in order to con&s;titute his guilt, not whether the Attorney General approves the book&mdash;not whether you approve the book&mdash;but whether Paine did not &s;it down and write a book again&s;t a Con&s;titution which he ad|mired and loved, with the diabolical intention of pro|voking di&s;cord and &s;edition in the country. If this were proved, Thomas Paine could not be defended; but if he thinks, what I and you do not think, that the Con&s;titu|tion of England is not the be&s;t calculated to promote the happine&s;s of the people of this country, he is not guilty of any offence again&s;t the law, though his opi|nions may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of the Con&s;titution. Every man is protected in his opinions, it is only his conduct that makes guilt.</P>
<P>I hold it, Gentlemen, to be the duty of an advocate, if he &s;hould happen to have &s;entiments different from his client, that he is bound to conceal them. I hold him equally bound to di&s;clo&s;e his opinions, if they &s;hould happen to be favourable to him; for he is bound to exert his whole &s;aculties in &s;upport of his client. I am &s;ure that it will be of little weight, what may be my opinions upon tho&s;e doctrines; but I am ready to give my client all the benefit that he can derive from the declaration of my &s;entiments. I profe&s;s my&s;elf then to love the genuine principles of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; and I &s;olemnly believe, that the Con&s;titution, as admi|ni&s;tered by King, Lords, and Commons, is the be&s;t cal|culated to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of the people of this country, of any frame of Government, ever conceived by man. I think it nece&s;&s;ary thus to preface my parti|cular opinions, that you, Gentlement, may &s;ee that they come from no &s;u&s;pected quarter; that we are in uni&s;on with each other; and that in &s;triving to a&s;certain the truth, and to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of this country, we are animated by a common principle. I proceed, there|fore, to &s;ay, and this propo&s;ition I pledge my&s;elf to maintain, from the very nature of civil &s;ociety and Go|vernment, as well as from the theory and practice of the
<PB N="21" REF="22">Engli&s;h law, that unle&s;s it can be proved, which I con|tend it has not been, that he has endeavoured to excite individuals to rebellion again&s;t the national will, from an evil mind, you cannot convict him of a libel on the record. Though you and I may think differently, that is no object; there would be an end of the liberty of Engli&s;h men if they could not write and &s;peculate freely upon the principles of Government. The Freedom of the Pre&s;s of England, Gentlemen, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that a man mu&s;t not addre&s;s to individuals, upon the &s;pur of &s;ome occa&s;ion, opinions that &s;hall provoke them to &s;edi|tion, to in&s;urrection, and tumult; but he may freely addre&s;s to the univer&s;al rea&s;on of a whole nation, prin|ciples of Government, congenial with, or ho&s;tile to, the form of Government under which he lives. He may canvas the forms of Government in general, or he may di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e of his own in particular; he may take them to pieces, he may &s;crutinize them with the greate&s;t rigour&mdash;he may &s;tate what he thinks to be wrong in the original conception; he may trace the gradual pro|gre&s;s of decay, or of corruption; he may point out the con&s;equences; he may dwell on their enormity; he may warn the people of their fate; and, in all this, he is not the &s;ubject of a criminal pro|&s;ecution. He is not criminal, unle&s;s he did it, not contemplating the hope of meliorating the con|dition of the people, but &s;ea&s;ting on the mi&s;ery, with the pro&s;pect of which he indulged a diabolical na|ture. The Liberty of the Pre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this, that any individual may teach his fellow-citizens doctrines in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e under which they live; he may exerci&s;e his own faculties: he may provoke them to the exerci&s;e of theirs; he may per&s;uade the whole peo|ple to agree with him in the&s;e doctrines, and he is not guilty; but if he &s;hall teach it as a doctrine, that any individual may oppo&s;e the law of the land, may re&s;i&s;t the legal authority, and may, by him&s;elf, or in con|junction with others, not merely di&s;obey, but thwart and impede the &s;ettled order of &s;ociety, he would be guilty of a libel upon the record. Shew me an expre&s;|&s;ion like the&s;e in the books of Thomas Paine; &s;hew me, from any part of the evidence which the Attorney
<PB N="22" REF="23">General has brought forward, any thing to prove the evil mind of the author. The Attorney General has brought forward a &s;et of pa&s;&s;ages, but he knows that pa&s;&s;ages are not to be taken without the context. You mu&s;t di&s;cover the mind of Thomas Paine in his book, and as you mu&s;t take his book out of Court with you it will be your duty to read it carefully. What will you &s;ay, Gentlemen, when you find, in the very Pre|face to his book, the following &s;entiments? Every one knows, that the very end of a preface is to announce to the reader the intention and &s;ub&s;tance of the following tract; and here you will find, Gentlemen, in the very out&s;et of this dangerous and diabolical performance, an antidote to the very poi&s;on which it is &s;tated to di&s;&s;eminate.</P>
<P>"If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the prac|tice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors, to rea&s;on on its defects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub|&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it al&s;o my practice), that it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e, at the &s;ame time, of every argu|ment to &s;hew its errors, and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it: becau&s;e the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to di&s;cre|tionary violations of tho&s;e which are good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to principles and forms of Go|vernment, or to what are called Con&s;titutions, and the parts of which they are compo&s;ed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"It is for the good of Nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular individuals, that Government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that man|kind are at the expence of &s;upporting it. The defects of every Government and Con&s;titution, both as to prin|ciple and form, mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law; and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When the&s;e defects, and the means of remedying them are generally &s;een by a Nation, that Nation will reform its Government or its Con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the Government repealed or reformed the law
<PB N="23" REF="24">in the other. The operations of Government are re|&s;tricted to the making and the admini&s;tering of laws; but it is to a Nation that the right of forming or re|forming, generating or re-generating Con&s;titutions and Governments belong; and con&s;equently tho&s;e &s;ubjects, as &s;ubjects of inve&s;tigation, are always before a country as a matter of right, and cannot, without invading the general right of that country, be made &s;ubjects for pro|&s;ecution."</P>
<P>The&s;e, Gentlemen, are the Rights of Man: for no man can, without rebellion, withdraw his obedience; nothing &s;hort of the will of the whole can alter the Con&s;titution of a country, but every individual of that country may publi&s;h his opinions, may give his advice, and may endeavour to bring over other people to his &s;entiments. If a man taught that his fellow-citizens might act at their di&s;cretion, if he were to &s;ay that their natural rights freed them from all re&s;traint, and that they were to form to them&s;elves the rule of their own conduct, in direct oppo&s;ition to the exi&s;ting law, he could not be acquitted by a tribunal of Engli&s;h ju&s;tice; but if a man teaches the wi&s;dom of Revi&s;ion and Reform, the duty of meliorating our condition to the uttermo&s;t, or even the advantages that would flow, in his opinion, from a complete alteration of the form of our Govern|ment, he acts upon the known, acknowledged, valuable privileges of an Engli&s;hman. Thanks be to God, and to the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, &s;uch has ever been our advantageous Liberty, with &s;ome &s;light and melancholy interruption, which I &s;hall bye and bye &s;tate to you. If no man could have gone before the day in which he lived, and pointed out, from the force of &s;uperior in|tellect, improvements in our &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem, how could Government have pa&s;&s;ed on from &s;tage to &s;tage, from &s;tate to &s;tate, until at la&s;t it has acquired the beautiful &s;hape and pro&s;perous e&s;tabli&s;hment, which the Attorney General thinks it would be profanation to touch, and to &s;uch a &s;tate of perfection as to make it a vain hope to look for any further melioration?</P>
<P>What is the faire&s;t fruits of the Engli&s;h Tree of Li|berty?&mdash; The &s;ecurity of our rights and of the law, and that no man &s;hall be brought to trial where there is
<PB N="24" REF="25">prejudice exi&s;ting again&s;t him. If any thing appears that can infect the minds of the Jury, the Court upon motion will po&s;tpone the trial. The Noble Lord will recollect, that upon this principle the trial of the Dean of St. A&s;aph was po&s;tponed; for it was &s;tated in the Court, that a number of extracts from ancient books, a&s;|&s;erting the rights of Jurors, had been circulated; and the Noble Lord put off the trial. If &s;uch was the ca&s;e upon the more circulation of a &s;et of extracts from a &s;et of writers of high authority, what mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of my client?&mdash;This book, and this de&s;endant, have been the &s;ubjects of every &s;ort of imputation. Pending the trial, even a &s;et of A&s;&s;ociators, who know &s;o little of the Con&s;titution of England, as to interfere with the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, circulate an an&s;wer to this very pamphlet. It is given away at turnpikes, thrown down our areas, thru&s;t into every man's hand. The coffee-hou&s;es, the new&s;papers, are full of it&mdash;nay, that high tribunal, which is the guardian, and the repre&s;entative of the popular branch of England, has been in&s;ulted with anathemas again&s;t this man, and again&s;t this book. What is the re&s;ult of all this?&mdash;That the cau&s;e is pre|judged &mdash;that the mind of no man within the &s;weep of this torrent can be free; and that if I had made a mo|tion in the Court, I am confident that the ju&s;tice of the Noble Lord would have po&s;tponed the trial. What is the con&s;equence of all this? You, Gentlemen, mu&s;t guard your minds again&s;t the approach of this frenzy; that you mu&s;t collect firmne&s;s with con&s;cience, and ele|vate your&s;elves above the feeblene&s;s of human weakne&s;s. &mdash;You mu&s;t di&s;cover his mind in his book, not in the rage, nor in the cant of the times. You mu&s;t throw away every thing but the book&mdash;the forged letter that has been read to you, you mu&s;t equally reject. I heard of this &s;ame forged letter, and I have rea&s;on to believe it to be a foul forgery, brought forward at this moment, not merely to embarra&s;s me, but to embarra&s;s you; but you mu&s;t prove that you are not men who&s;e under|&s;tandings are to be tortured by &s;uch appeals. You will prove by your verdict, that you will deal by this man as you would wi&s;h to be dealt with in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion.&mdash;Remember this doctrine of Engli&s;hmen, that
<PB N="25" REF="26"><HI>opinion is free.</HI>&mdash;If I were to move an amendment in any part of the exi&s;ting laws of the land, would it be right, would it be rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould convict me of a libel, becau&s;e you differed from me in opinion? It is the opinion of this author, that it is the duty of citizens to obey a law while it exi&s;ts. "When a nation," &s;ays he, "changes its opinions and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy to attempt by force, what ought to be accompli&s;hed by rea&s;on. Rebellion con&s;i&s;ts in forcibly oppo&s;ing the general will of a na|tion, whether by a party or by individuals." Such is the doctrine of Thomas Paine; and I a&s;&s;ert this to be the true law of England; and I &s;ay, that I give the be&s;t proof of my attachment to the illu&s;trious family upon the throne, when I maintain the&s;e doctrines: and when I a&s;&s;ert, that they are the &s;afe&s;t for their de&s;irable intere&s;ts, and for their honour. The Attorney Gene|ral, in his ob&s;ervation upon the infamous a&s;per&s;ion on the Royal Family, &s;peaks of the heir-apparent of the Crown from hope&mdash;I &s;peak from knowledge. Without detaining you for one moment to animadvert on what I think, the indecency of the tamene&s;s with which impu|tations on the Royal progeny have been &s;uffered of late, of the apparent di&s;inclinations to pro&s;ecute what tends to break the be&s;t hopes of Engli&s;hmen, and wound the fonde&s;t feelings of the Royal bo&s;om, while there is an eagerne&s;s to pro&s;ecute the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of popular opi|nions. I believe, and I know, that if ever there was a man more firmly attached than another to the pure principles of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, to tho&s;e rights of the people, the exerci&s;e of which &s;eated the pre&s;ent Family upon the throne, it is the heir-apparent of the Crown of the&s;e realms. If there &s;hall come a time that, by the cour&s;e of nature, and God forbid that it &s;hould ever happen otherwi&s;e than by the cour&s;e of nature, he &s;hould &s;ucceed to the throne of his ance&s;tors, I have the firme&s;t confidence that he will make the Con&s;titu|tion the rule of his conduct. I know that the&s;e &s;enti|ments are congenial to his brea&s;t. I had the honour, in my place in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when I believe that augu&s;t per&s;on was pre&s;ent, to pronounce my opi|nion
<PB N="26" REF="27">on political doctrines, and to put the title of the King's Maje&s;ty upon the right which the people have to chu&s;e their chief Magi&s;trate&mdash;the only right upon which, in my opinion, the title can be truly &s;afe.</P>
<P>In endeavouring to find the true &s;pirit with which this book was written, you mu&s;t go back to the train of circum&s;tances which have formed the habits and opi|nions of the author. You cannot have forgotten that calamitous aera in our hi&s;tory, to which no man can look back without horror,&mdash;the aera of the American war. This man performed a con&s;iderable part on that memorable theatre; and of his conduct there, Mr. Burke, that celebrated character, of whom I cannot &s;peak otherwi&s;e than with great re&s;pect, however he may affect to treat me with contempt, has &s;poken of the conduct of Thomas Paine with high re&s;pect. Here Mr. Er&s;kine read &s;ome quotations from his <HI>Thoughts on he Cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent di&s;content,</HI> and other works in commendation of Thomas Paine, and he &s;aid that the&s;e two per&s;ons u&s;ed to be of the &s;ame mind, though they now differ. Paine might be right, but Mr. Burke could not be right, for Mr. Paine had been con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, but Mr. Burke had contradicted every former opinion. Paine &s;eeing the con&s;equences of the conduct of Britain with regard to America, had at|tacked the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, for Mr. Er&s;kine &s;aid, he does attack the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution&mdash;I do not affect to deny it. He &s;peaks again&s;t the original frame of our Con&s;titution, what I think is only applicable to its de|cay, and what, for I will not mince the matter, proceeds from corruptions which would bring on the ruin of us all, if I did not know and believe that the Con&s;titution contains the &s;eeds of its own reform. Is it libellous in him, however, to &s;ay what he has &s;aid again&s;t the con|&s;titutent branches of our Con&s;titution?&mdash;the grande&s;t authorities of England have done the &s;ame. Mr. Er&s;kine quoted a pa&s;&s;age of a letter from Sir George Savile to his con&s;tituents&mdash;[Vide Annual Regi&s;ter for 1780, p. 400.]&mdash;"I return to you," &s;ays Sir George, "baffled and di&s;pirited, and, I am &s;orry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope, of &s;eeing any change in the mi&s;erable cour&s;e of public calamities." And of Sir
<PB N="27" REF="28">George Savile, Mr. Er&s;kine gave the admirable cha|racter as drawn by Mr. Burke. At this time Mr. Paine and Mr. Burke fought in the &s;ame field&mdash;Mr. Burke &s;poke to Parliament, Mr. Paine to the People. Mr. Paine has only been a plagiary from him&s;elf; he has been drawn on in the &s;ame train of thinking; and, therefore, I a&s;&s;ert that his book is the product of his real &s;entiments, the genuine efforts of a mind &s;truggling for what he conceives to be the intere&s;ts of Humanity. The cau&s;e is potent, it produced the revolution in America, it produced the revolution in France; where a Government, incurable from its corruption, and profli|gacy, was totally overthrown; but can the &s;ame doc|trines affect the Con&s;titution of England? No. His doctrines had no effect, nor could there have occurred a period when the public mind could have been excited by any &s;uch doctrines, if it had not been previou&s;ly provoked by the inflammatory, the ill-judged, and the exa&s;perating doctrines of Mr. Burke. He it was who led the van in all this war of &s;edition.&mdash;Let us go back for a moment to this origin. When the people of this country &s;aw this de&s;picable government of France demoli&s;hed&mdash;that government which had been the &s;courge of England&mdash;they rejoiced in the happine&s;s of &s;o many millions. A reverend divine, now no more, made it the &s;ubject of exhortation from the pulpit. A &s;ociety of gentlemen met to celebrate it, and Mr. Burke was rou&s;ed by this into the fever of oppo&s;ition. Though he repre&s;ented them as an in&s;ignificant body of ob&s;cure individuals, he attacked the whole &s;y&s;tem of England with &s;uch bitterne&s;s of invective, and attacked the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines, with &s;uch vehemence of di&s;&s;ent, that from that day till this the flame of contention has not cea&s;ed to rage.&mdash;What was the principle of this work?&mdash;That the People of England had no right, no power, to change a tittle of their Con&s;titution; that it was an indi&s;&s;oluble compact, which at no time, on no ground, for no rea&s;on, could be broken: &s;o that neither rea&s;on nor revelation, however they might point out to the people of England a better form of government, wi&s;er in&s;titutes of peace, &s;tronger ba&s;es of liberty, they dur&s;t not &s;trive to attain them. If it be &s;o, for God's
<PB N="28" REF="29">&s;ake, let policy and di&s;cretion &s;trive to conceal the af|flicting truth, for it will &s;urely lead to the convul&s;ion which he affects to deprecate. Rather put Paine into the hands of every man, make the lowe&s;t ignorance ac|quainted with his doctrines, and cha&s;e away, if it be po&s;&s;ible, the impre&s;&s;ions which Mr. Burke has made. How different is the doctrine of truth and of peace!&mdash; How different is the doctrine of the Revolution! Look at the Con&s;titution, &s;ay the friends of liberty, it is your own trea&s;ure. Will you keep it as it is, or will you change it at the &s;ugge&s;tion of every theori&s;t? Your own happine&s;s is at &s;take; but remember the happine&s;s that it has produced you. Will they not be likely to touch with awe a Con&s;titution which comes thus re|commended to them by parental tenderne&s;s? and will they not protect it with parental authority?&mdash;Look now at the addre&s;s of Mr. Burke. Here is your Con|&s;titution, which we have made for you, and for your po&s;terity for ever. We buckle it on your backs, for you are bea&s;ts of burden. You mu&s;t not dare to touch it&mdash;you have entered into a compact which is indi&s;&s;olu|ble. Are &s;uch doctrines the legitimate way of endear|ing the Con&s;titution to the people? And I mention all this in order to &s;hew you what the book of Mr. Paine is; for Paine's book is an an&s;wer to tho&s;e doctrines of Mr. Burke&mdash;doctrines more injurious than any that could be a&s;&s;erted by Republicans and Levellers!</P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine then cited &s;everal of our mo&s;t eminent Engli&s;h writers, who&s;e &s;entiments are congenial with tho&s;e of Mr. Paine on the &s;ubject of Government.&mdash;He fir&s;t quoted Mr. Paley on the Principles of Moral and Political Philo&s;ophy, p. 426.</P>
<P N="5">V. <Q>No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever is &s;o binding, that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the Community. The family of the Prince, the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the prerogative of the Crown, the form and parts of the Legi&s;lature, together with the re&s;|pective powers, office, duration, and mutual de|pendency of the &s;everal parts, are all only &s;o many <HI>laws,</HI> mutable like other laws, whenever expe|diency

Such rea&s;ons have no place in our &s;y&s;tem? to us, if there be any good rea&s;on for treating the&s;e with more deference and re&s;pect than other laws; it is either the advantage of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of Government (which rea&s;on mu&s;t be of different force in different countries), or becau&s;e in all coun|tries, it is of importance, that the form and u&s;age of governing be acknowledged and under&s;tood, as well by the governors as the governed, and becau&s;e the &s;eldomer it is changed, the more it will be re&s;|pected by both &s;ides.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine then introduced Hume's Hi&s;tory of England, vol. ii. p. 88.</P>
<P><Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the former articles of the Great Charter contain &s;uch mitigations and ex|planations of the Feodal Law as are rea&s;onable and equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a Loyal Government, and provide for the equal di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, and free enjoy|ment of property; the great object for which po|litical &s;ociety was at fir&s;t founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor &s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and attention.</Q></P>
<P>The next Writer was the immortal Locke, and he cit|ed the following pa&s;&s;ages from his Treati&s;e on Civil Government, p. 268, 270, 309, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<P><Q><HI>All men, &s;ay they, are born under Government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a &s;ubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of &s;ubjection and allegiance.</HI> It is plain mankind never owned nor con&s;idered any &s;uch natural <HI>&s;ubjection that they were born in,</HI> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own con&s;ents, to a &s;ubjection to them and their heirs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e who would per&s;uade us, that by <HI>being born under any government we are naturally &s;ubjects to it,</HI> and have no more any title or pretence to the free|dom of the &s;tate of Nature, have no other rea&s;on (bating that of paternal power, which we have al|ready an&s;wered) to produce for it, but only becau&s;e our fathers or progenitors pa&s;&s;ed away their natur|al liberty, and thereby bound up them&s;elves and their po&s;terity to a perpetual &s;ubjection to the go|vernment, which they them&s;elves &s;ubmitted to. It is true, that whatever engagements or promi|&s;es any one has made for him&s;elf, he is under the obligation of them, but <HI>cannot, by any compact what&s;oever, bind his children or po&s;terity;</HI> for his &s;on, when a man, being altogether as free as the father, any <HI>act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the &s;on,</HI> that it can of any body el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And therefore they have a very wrong notion of Government who &s;ay, that the people have incroached upon the prerogative, when they have got any part of it to be defined by po&s;itive laws; for in &s;o doing, they have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right belonged to him, but only declared that that power which they in|definitely left in his or his ance&s;tor's hands to be exerci&s;ed for their good; was not a thing which they intended him when he u&s;ed it otherwi&s;e; for the end of Government being the good of the Community, what&s;oever alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an encroachment upon any body, &s;ince nobody in Government can have a right tending to any other end: and tho&s;e only are
<PB N="31" REF="32">encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good. Tho&s;e who &s;ay otherwi&s;e, &s;peak as if the prince had a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate intere&s;t from the good of the Community, and was not made for it; the root and &s;ource from which &s;pring almo&s;t all tho&s;e evils and di&s;|orders which happen in Kingly Governments. And indeed, if that be &s;o, the people under his government are not a &s;ociety of rational creatures, entered into a community for their mutual good; they are not &s;uch as have &s;et rulers over them&s;elves, to guard and pro|mote that good; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures, under the dominion of a ma&s;ter, who keeps them and works them for his own plea&s;ure or profit. If men were &s;o void of rea&s;on, and bruti&s;h, as to enter into &s;ociety upon &s;uch terms, Prerogative might indeed be, what &s;ome men would have it, an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the people.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And, therefore, though the People cannot be judge, &s;o as to have, by the con&s;titution of that &s;ociety, any &s;uperior power, to determine and give effective &s;en|tence in the ca&s;e; yet, they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all po&s;itive laws of men, re&s;erved that ultimate determination to them&s;elves which be|longs to all mankind; God and Nature never allowing a man &s;o to abandon him&s;elf, as to neglect his own pre&s;ervation; and &s;ince he cannot take away his own life, neither can he give another power to take it. Nor let any one think this lays a perpetual foundation for di&s;order; for this operates not till the inconveniency is &s;o great, that the majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a nece&s;&s;ity to have it amended. But this the executive power, or wi&s;e princes, never need come in the danger of; and it is the thing, of all others, they have mo&s;t need to avoid, as of all others the mo&s;t perilous.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When&s;oever, therefore, the legi&s;lative &s;hall tran&s;|gre&s;s this fundamental will of &s;ociety, and either by ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, endeavour to gra&s;p them&s;elves, or put into the hands of any other, an ab&s;olute power over the lives, liberties, and e&s;tates of the people; by this breach of truth they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for
<PB N="32" REF="33">quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to re&s;ume their original liberty, and, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new legi&s;lative, (&s;uch as they &s;hall think fit) provide for their own &s;afety and &s;ecurity, which is the end for which they are in &s;ociety. What I have &s;aid here, concerning the legi&s;lative, (&s;uch as they &s;hall think fit) provide for their own &s;afety and &s;ecurity, which is the end for which they are in &s;ociety. What I have &s;aid here, concerning the legi&s;lative in general, holds true con|cerning the &s;upreme executor, who having a double tru&s;t put in him, both to have a part in the legi&s;la|tive, and the &s;upreme execution of the law, acts again&s;t both, when he goes about to &s;et up his own arbitary will as the law of the &s;ociety. He acts al&s;o contrary to his tru&s;t, when he either employs the force, trea&s;ure, and offices, of the Society, to corrupt the repre&s;entatives, and gain them to his purpo&s;es: or openly pre-engages the electors, and pre&s;cribes to their choice &s;uch, whom he has by &s;olicitations, threats, promi&s;es, or otherwi&s;e, won to his de&s;igns; and employs them to bring in &s;uch, who have pro|mi&s;ed before-hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new|model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the Government by the roots, and poi&s;on the very fountain of public &s;ecurity? For the people having re&s;erved to them&s;elves the choice of their repre&s;enta|tives, as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they may always be freely cho&s;en, and &s;o cho&s;en, freely act and advi&s;e, as the nece&s;&s;ity of the commonwealth, and the public good, &s;hould, upon examination, and mature debate, be judged to require. This tho&s;e who give their votes before they hear the debate, and have weighed the rea&s;ons on all &s;ides, are not capable of doing. To prepare &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly as this, and endeavour to &s;et up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true repre&s;entatives of the people, and the law-makers of the &s;ociety, is certainly as great a breach of tru&s;t, and as perfect a declaration of a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the Government, as is po&s;&s;ible to be met with. To
<PB N="33" REF="34">which, if one &s;hall add rewards and puni&s;hments vi&s;ibly employed to the &s;ame end, and all the arts of perverted law made u&s;e of to take off and de&s;troy all that &s;tand in the way of &s;uch a de&s;ign, and will not comply and con&s;ent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be pa&s;t doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the &s;ociety, who thus employ it contrary to the tru&s;t which went along with it in its fir&s;t in&s;titution, is ea&s;y to determine; and one cannot but &s;ee, that he who has once attempted any &s;uch thing as this, cannot any longer be tru&s;ted.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Fir&s;t, No more than any other hypothe&s;is: for when the People are made mi&s;erable and find them|&s;elves expo&s;ed to the ill u&s;uage of arbitrary power, cry up their governors, as much as you will, for &s;ons of Jupiter; let them be &s;acred and divine, de&s;|cended or authorized from Heaven; give them out for whom or what you plea&s;e, the &s;ame will happen. The People generally ill-treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any occa&s;ion to ea&s;e them|&s;elves of a burden that &s;its heavy upon them. They will wi&s;h, and &s;eek for the opportunity, which in the change, weakne&s;s and accidents of human affairs, &s;eldom delays long to offer it&s;elf.

<PB N="34" REF="35">which, ancient names, and &s;pecious forms, are &s;o far from being better, that they are much wor&s;e, than the &s;tate of nature, or pure Anarchy; the inconve|niencies being all as great and as near, but the reme|dy farther off and more difficult.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thirdly, I an&s;wer, that this doctrine of a power in the people of providing for their &s;afety a-new, by a new legi&s;lative, when their leg&s;lators have acted con|trary to their tru&s;t, by invading their property, is the be&s;t fence again&s;t rebellion, and the probable&s;t means to hinder it: for rebellion being an oppo&s;ition, not to per&s;ons, but authority, which is founded only in the Con&s;titutions and Laws of the Government; tho&s;e, whoever they be, who by force break through, and by force ju&s;tify their violation of them, are truly and properly rebels: for when men, by entering into &s;o|ciety and civil government, have excluded force, and introdueed laws for the pre&s;ervation of property, peace and unity among&s;t them&s;elves, tho&s;e who &s;et up force again in oppo&s;ition to the laws, do <HI>rebel|lure,</HI> that is, bring back again the &s;tate of war, and are properly rebels: which they who are in power, (by the pretence they have to authority, the temp|tation of force they have in they their hands, and the flattery of tho&s;e about them) being likelie&s;t to do; the propere&s;t way to prevent the evil, is to &s;hew them the danger and inju&s;tice of it, who are under the greate&s;t temptation to run into it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor let any one &s;ay, that mi&s;chief can ari&s;e from hence, as often as it &s;hall plea&s;e a bu&s;y head, or turbulent &s;pirit, to de&s;ire the alteration of the Goyernment. It is true, &s;uch men may &s;tir whenever they plea&s;e; but it will be only to their own ju&s;t ruin and perdition: for till the mi&s;chief be grown general, and the ill de&s;igns of the rulers become vi&s;ible, or their attempts &s;en&s;ible to the greater part, the people, who are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer than right them&s;elves by re&s;i&s;tance, are not apt to &s;tir. The examples of particular inju&s;tice, or oppe&s;&s;ion of here and there an unfortunate man, moves them not. But if they univer&s;ally have a per&s;ua&s;ion grounded upon manife&s;t evidence, that
<PB N="35" REF="36">de&s;igns are carrying on again&s;t their liberties, and the general cour&s;e and tendency of things cannot but give them &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of the evil intention of their Governors, who is to be blamed for it? Who can help it, if they who might avoid it, bring them&s;elves into this &s;u&s;picion? Are the people to be blamed, if they have the &s;en&s;e of ra|tional creatures, and can think of things no other|wi&s;e than as they find and feel them?&mdash;And is it not rather their fault who put things into &s;uch a po&s;ture, that they would not have them thought to be as they are? I grant that the pride, ambition, and turbulency of private men, have &s;ometimes cau&s;ed great di&s;orders in commonwealths, and fac|tions have been fatal to &s;tates and kingdoms. But whether the mi&s;chief hath oftner begun in the peo|ple's wantonne&s;s, and a de&s;ire to ca&s;t off the lawful authority of their rulers, or in the rulers' in&s;olence, and endeavours to get and exerci&s;e an arbitrary power over their people; whether oppre&s;&s;ion or di&s;obedience gave the fir&s;t rife to the di&s;order, I leave it to impartial hi&s;tory to determine.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burkes's Letter to the Sheriffs of Bri&s;tol, was then introduced; and Mr. Er&s;kine read the following pa&s;&s;ages from p. 55. 57, 58.</P>
<P><Q>If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this, 'That the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of America is wholly aver&s;e to any other than a free government;' and this is indication enough to any hone&s;t State&s;man, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e. If any a&s;k me what a free government is, I an&s;wer, that, for any practical purpo&s;e it is what the people think &s;o; and that they and not I, are the natural, lawful, and competent judges of this matter. If they practically allow me a greater degree of au|thority over them, than is con&s;i&s;tent with any cor|rect ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for &s;o great a tru&s;t, and not to endeavour to prove from thence, that they have rea&s;oned ami&s;s, and that having gone &s;o far, by analogy, they mu&s;t hereafter have no enjoyment but my plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<P><Q>Civil Freedom, gentlemen, is not, as many have endeavoured to per&s;uade you, a thing that lies hid in the depth of ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience. But is a ble&s;&s;ing and a benefit, not an ab&s;tract &s;pecula|tion; and all the ju&s;t rea&s;oning that can be upon it, is of &s;o coar&s;e a texture, as perfectly to &s;uit the ordinary capacities of tho&s;e who are to enjoy and to defend it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For Liberty is a good to be improved, and not an evil to be le&s;&s;ened. It is not only a pri|vate ble&s;&s;ing of the fir&s;t order, but the vital &s;pring and energy of the &s;tate it&s;elf, which has ju&s;t &s;o much life and vigour as there is liberty in it. But whether liberty be advantageous or not, (for I know it is a fa&s;hion to decry the very prin|ciple) none will di&s;pute that peace is a ble&s;&s;ing; and peace mu&s;t, in the cour&s;e of human affairs, be frequently bought by &s;ome indulgence and toleration at lea&s;t of liberty. For as the Sabbath (though of divine in&s;titution) was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, Government, which can claim no higher origin or authority, in its exerci&s;e at lea&s;t, ought to conform to the exi|gencies of the times, and the temper and cha|racter of the people with whom it is concerned, and not always to attempt, violently, to bend the people to their theories of Subjection. The bulk of Mankind, on their part, are not exce&s;&s;ively curious concerning any theories, while they are really happy; and one &s;ure &s;ymptom of an ill-conducted State, is the propen&s;ity of the people to re&s;ort to them.</Q></P>
<P>Do not let us be ra&s;h, Gentlemen, in deciding upon this great que&s;tion. Before we condemn this author by bell, book, and candle, let us reflect a little on the progre&s;s of the principles of freedom. It is but one year ago, that I could have an opportunity of addre&s;|&s;ing to you &s;uch an argument. Gentlemen, your au|thority to judge of a Libel is but a year old. It is but &s;even or eight years ago when I &s;tood upon a que&s;|tion like the pre&s;ent, upon very different grounds, when I had le&s;s to &s;upport me again&s;t the embarra&s;s|ment
<PB N="37" REF="38">with which I was &s;orrounded in the pre&s;ence of an enlightened profe&s;&s;ion, and holding a doctrine that was &s;couted. The Earl of Mansfield, who, though he could not treat me with unkindne&s;s, for it was not in his nature, laughed at me as you laugh at the prattle of a child; and I was de&s;ired to go to &s;chool with my new-fangled doctrines, to learn the law of the land. Here is an argument again&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s. I have lived to &s;ee the Parliament of England unanimou&s;ly declare that I was in the right. Knowing then that it has been by &s;low and gradual degrees, that the con|&s;titution of England has grown to what it is, for God's &s;ake let us be careful not to &s;tifle the voice of rea&s;on by a ra&s;h and ha&s;ty deci&s;ion. If Mr. Burke's doctrine be right, no opinions upon government can be publi&s;hed, for the people have no juri&s;diction. If the people have not the power to alter and amend, advice is not mere|ly impertinent, it is dangerous. A juri&s;diction to be competent mu&s;t have power; and when, therefore, he a&s;&s;erts that the people of this country are utterly and for ever deprived of the power of changing their Con&s;titution, he pronouces a prohibition upon all rea|&s;oning, upon all opinion, upon all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. What has been the cour&s;e of man? That he has been led by awful authorities, &s;tep by &s;tep, from his &s;avage &s;tate in the woods, to our pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ed condition of light, of knowledge, and of enjoyments. We &s;hould &s;till be &s;avages, we &s;hould yet be in the woods, if this pro|hibition had exi&s;ted; and to what mu&s;t we return, if every man is to be condemned, who &s;hall now pro|mulgate the opinions that he entertains upon the nature of government?</P>
<P>Of all the attainments of a people, the Liberty of the Pre&s;s has been uniformly the la&s;t&mdash;Uniformly de&s;|poti&s;m has re&s;i&s;ted the propagation of truth. All other conce&s;&s;ions power has been willing to make, but again&s;t the truths of rea&s;on&mdash;again&s;t the light of knowledge, it has maintained an eternal war. Let us recollect the cour&s;e of the world, the univer&s;al God of Nature, the Saviour of Mankind, the Fountain of all Light, who came to &s;ave man from eternal darkne&s;s, expired on a cro&s;s&mdash;the object of Infidel &s;corn&mdash;of impious incredu|lity, becau&s;e they ra&s;hly oppo&s;ed the meek and mild
<PB N="38" REF="39">propagation of the truths that were to point to peace and happine&s;s in the world. His ble&s;&s;ed followers felt victims to the &s;ame horrid &s;pirit. The Saviour might have come, inve&s;ted with eternal power, and compelled the in&s;tantaneous acceptance of his doctrines. But he came to confound the pride of worldly power. He came cloathed in meekne&s;s, in benevolence, in humi|lity, and he preached his con&s;olations to the poor; in this way did political power continue to exerci&s;e its tyranny, until religion had ari&s;en to &s;uch a &s;tandard as to make it formidable; and then political power took eccle&s;ia&s;tical power into partner&s;hip, when they exerted their combined efforts at once again&s;t the rea&s;on, and the con&s;cience of man. Thus, upon the revival of letters, was &s;uper&s;tition made the in&s;trument of politi|cal tyranny; but at length the inqui&s;itive &s;pirit of Engli&s;hmen bur&s;t the chains, and the Liberty of the Pre&s;s had its beginning. It was free until, (in 1637), the Star Chamber was erected; mark the con&s;e|quence, the people &s;uffered under re&s;traint indeed; but in eleven years Charles I. peri&s;hed on a &s;caffold. Gentlemen, the human mind cannot live under re&s;traint. Let men communicate their thoughts with freedom, and their indignation fly off like a fire &s;pread on the &s;urface; like gunpowder &s;cattered they kindle, they communicate; but the explo&s;ion is neither loud nor dangerous:&mdash;keep them under re&s;traint, it is a &s;ubterraneous fire, who&s;e agitation is un&s;een untill it bur&s;ts into earthquake or volcano. Such was the whole effect of the re&s;traints in England. Crom|well &s;uffered almo&s;t all his misfortunes from this cau&s;e, and the vigour of his government could not &s;ave it again&s;t the con&s;equences of his attack on the liberty of the pre&s;s. The re&s;traint continued under Charles II. and the emotions that it produced, happily for England and for man, ended in the revolution. All the licen&s;es were done away, the pre&s;s was made free, and the Con&s;titution has already endured a century. Thus, gentlemen, our government has been &s;afe in proportion to the freedom of writing. Here Mr. Er&s;kine produced &s;ome of the fine&s;t authorities of England&mdash;the glorious Milton led the van: his memorable pa&s;&s;age, that in former times the i&s;&s;ue of the brain was no more &s;tifled than the i&s;&s;ue of the womb, and his fine illu&s;tration of the con&s;equences of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing truth, in the fate of Galileo,
<PB N="39" REF="40">were dexterou&s;ly u&s;ed by Mr. Er&s;kine&mdash;He peri&s;hed in a pri&s;on, becau&s;e he ventured to think, from ob&s;erving the pha&s;es of Venus, that the &s;un was that centre of our &s;y&s;tem, and yet, &s;aid he, we know that the &s;un is in that centre, and by our knowledge, we are enabled to pu&s;h our navigation to the extreme limits of the world, and, by line and rule, to make our way through regions the mo&s;t unknown.</P>
<P>He then cited the following pa&s;&s;age from Milton's Areo|pagatica, p. 58.</P>
<P><Q>If it be de&s;ired to know the immediate cau&s;e of all this free writing, and free &s;peaking, there cannot be a&s;|&s;igned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane government; it is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your own valourous and happy coun&s;els have pur|cha&s;ed us; liberty which is the nur&s;e of all great wits this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our &s;pirits like the influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchi&s;ed, enlarged, and lifted up our apprehen&s;ions degrees above them&s;elves.

We can grow ignorant again, bruti&s;h, formal, and &s;lav|i&s;h, as ye found us; but you then mu&s;t fir&s;t become that which ye cannot be, oppre&s;&s;ive, arbitrary, and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the &s;earch and expectation of the greate&s;t and exacte&s;t things, is the i&s;&s;ue of your own virtue propagated in us; ye cannot &s;uppre&s;s that, unle&s;s ye reinforce an abrogated and mercile&s;s law, that fathers may di&s;patch at will their own children. And who &s;hall then &s;tick clo&s;e&s;t to ye, and excite others? Not he who takes up arms for coat and conduct, and his four nobles of <HI>Danegelt.</HI> Al|though I di&s;prai&s;e not the defence of ju&s;t immunities, yet love my peace better, if that were all. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to con&s;cience, above all liberties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What would be be&s;t advi&s;ed then, if it be found &s;o hurt|ful and &s;o unequal to &s;uppre&s;s opinions for the newne&s;s or un&s;uitablene&s;s to a cu&s;tomary acceptance, will not be my ta&s;k to &s;ay; I &s;hall only repeat what I have learnt from the Lord Brook&mdash;he exhorts us to hear with patience and
<PB N="40" REF="41">humility, tho&s;e, however they may be mi&s;called, that de&s;ire to live purely in &s;uch a u&s;e of God's Ordinances as the be&s;t guidance to their con&s;ciences gives them, and to tolerate them, though in &s;ome di&s;conformity to our&s;elves.&mdash;And now the time in &s;pecial is by privilege to write and &s;peak what may help to further the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of matters in agi|tation.&mdash;The Temple of Janus, with his two controver|&s;ial faces, might now not in&s;ignificantly be &s;et open; and although all the Winds of Doctrine were let loo&s;e to play upon the earth, &s;o Truth be in the field, we do injurious by licen&s;ing and prohibiting to mi&s;doubt her &s;trength&mdash;let her and fal&s;hood grapple; who ever knew truth put to the wor&s;e in a free and open encounter? her confuting is the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ing&mdash;when a man hath been labouring the harde&s;t labour in the deep mines of know|ledge; hath furni&s;hed out his findings in all their equipage; drawn forth his rea&s;on as it were a battle ranged; &s;catter|ed and defeated all objections in his way; calls out his ad|ver&s;ary into the plain; offers him all the advantage of wind and &s;ea, if he plea&s;e that he may try the matter by dint of argument&mdash;for his opponents then to &s;culk, to lay am|bu&s;hments, to keep a narrow bridge of licen&s;ing where the challenger &s;hould pa&s;s, though it be valour enough in &s;oldier&s;hip, is but weakne&s;s and cowardice in the wars of truth, for who knows not that Truth, like the Almighty, is &s;trong, &s;he needs no policies nor &s;tratagems</Q> (he might have added pro&s;ecutions) "to make her victorious."</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a connection between licentiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to correct the one, with|out dangerou&s;ly wounding the other; it is extremely hard to di&s;tingui&s;h the true limit between them: Like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two diffe|rent colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where the one ends, or where the other begins.</P>
<P>The Attorney General had given no principles to draw the line by which we were to know where the Liberty of the Pre&s;s ended, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s be|gan. He applied Lord Loughborough's memorable ob|&s;ervation of the application. "To your tents, O I&s;|rael," as a pregnant in&s;tance of what would be &s;editious. Earl Stanhope had, with great &s;hrewdne&s;s, ridiculed this &s;ort of Liberty of the Pre&s;s, which was to be all on one &s;ide&mdash;a liberty to prai&s;e Mini&s;ters. This is a
<PB N="41" REF="42">&s;ort of liberty that even the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia would give you, and it may be called the Ru&s;&s;ian Liberty of the Pre&s;s. To make the work of the author appear &s;e|ditious, the doctrine of Lord Loughborough mu&s;t be proved. It mu&s;t be &s;hewn that his doctrine was cou|pled with circum&s;tances, or with expre&s;&s;ions, tending clearly to provoke tumult; &s;uch as, "We &s;hall &s;ee how this will work&mdash;this will bring on a new revolu|tion&mdash;we &s;hall have French in&s;urrections." But, &s;aid Mr. Er&s;kine, no &s;uch thing: if one &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion had been proved, I would have thrown up my brief&mdash;as they are not, I &s;tand up to give him the benefits of a fair trial, and I am not to be &s;landered with the charge of di&s;affection for exerci&s;ing my faculties in his defence. When my Lord and I were engaged together as coun&s;el for Lord George Gordon, as well might we have been &s;u&s;pected of &s;avouring tumult and di&s;order, as that I now &s;hould be of &s;edition and di&s;affection.</P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine then cited a pa&s;&s;age from Lord Stan|hope's Rights of Juries Defended, as follows, page 142, 143, 144.</P>
<P><Q>The thing that is illegal, <HI>is the exciting any one to &s;edition, or to a breach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Peace.</HI> The que&s;tion, therefore, upon a Libel is, whether the Paper pu|bli&s;hed <HI>did thus excite and was &s;o intended.</HI> Con&s;e|quently mere <HI>&s;peculative</HI> writings on the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> are <HI>not Libels,</HI> however <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> they may be.

<P>Mr. Er&s;kine came now to examine the pa&s;&s;ages &s;et forth in the Information. We have already gone at &s;o much length into his general argument, as to be unable to follow him in the ingenuity of his ob&s;ervations on his Extract. As to the fir&s;t, that all hereditary govern|ment was a tyranny, he de&s;ired the Jury to look at the context. I deny, &s;ays Paine, that hereditary Monarchy is the Con&s;titution. He does not inherit us like floks, for the People may confer it; they have conferred it. This is his argument. The &s;econd was an extraor|dinary &s;election&mdash;it would be no attack upon the Revo|tion, if it had been accompli&s;hed by demons. Do we love the Reformation le&s;s for being accompli&s;hed by one of the mo&s;t profligate of our Kings? No matter that the Revolution was brought about by intrigue; that it was the work of a Coalition. It is not by whom, but what it is, that the People will enquire. He con|tended, that the People had, by the freedom of opinion, obtained every thing from Magna Charta downwards? The third quotation, that we had hardly any law in England; was no libel; for he did not arraign the admi|ni&s;tration
<PB N="43" REF="44">of law, and many of our be&s;t writers had a&s;|&s;erted, that there was much confu&s;ion, much difficulty, much to be mended in our juri&s;prudence. With regard to the pa&s;&s;ages on the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, it was &s;trange that Mr. Burke &s;hould accu&s;e him; he who had &s;o &s;everely, &s;o outrageou&s;ly impeached both Hou&s;es in their turn; and here he quoted &s;ome of the memorable pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Burke, of the Lords voting them&s;elves u&s;ele&s;s, and of an addre&s;&s;ing Hou&s;e of Com|mons, when there was a petitioning People. He quoted al&s;o the memorable Proclamation of Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond, from the Thatched Hou&s;e Ta|vern. On the celebrated pa&s;&s;age of Mr. Burke, that Kings were naturally fond of low company, and that Lords were only low buffoons, he made a &s;evere com|ment. It was a &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ion on the King, and on the Nobility; but the&s;e a&s;&s;ociators might write, though they would &s;uffer no one to write but them|&s;elves lawyers, though &s;o ignorant of the character and delicacy of the &s;aw, as to propagate every &s;pecies of prejudice again&s;t this man, and to create &s;uch a hue and cry again&s;t him, that if he had been &s;lained with blood in&s;tead of ink&mdash;if he had been degraded by the crimes that make humanity abhorrent, ought not to have been rai&s;ed again&s;t him in the moment of his trial&mdash;&s;uch a clamour, that even he was almo&s;t beat down and aba&s;hed by the roar. Even in the Hou&s;e of Parliament he was &s;tigmatized by name, but he had delivered his opinion with the &s;pirit and independence that becaume a profe&s;&s;ional man, determined not to &s;hrink from his duty, whatever might be the hazard. The&s;e a&s;&s;ociators, had, with equal ignorance, &s;aid, that the great Harrington was as great a thief, and as ob&s;cure a ruffian, even as Paine.&mdash;Who was Harrington?&mdash;It might have &s;atisfied them to have read his pedigree;&mdash;he was de&s;cended from eight Dukes, three Mar|qui&s;&s;es, &s;eventy Earls, twenty-&s;even Vi&s;counts, and thirty-&s;ix Barons, of which number &s;ixteen were Knights of the Garter. Will not this do, &s;aid Mr. Er&s;kine, even for this time?&mdash;In a Court of Germany it would be deci&s;ive; but what was better than his de&s;cent was his conduct. He was the faithful &s;ervant of his Ma&s;ter Charles; he was a man of
<PB N="44" REF="45">&s;uch undoubted honour, that he avowed his Republican prin|ciples, yet retained the confidence and affection of his ma&s;ter. "I know not," &s;ays Toland, <Q>which mo&s;t to commend&mdash;the King for tru&s;ting an hone&s;t man, though of Republican principles, or Harrington for owning his principles while he &s;erved a King.</Q> How did he &s;erve him? he &s;taid in the I&s;le of Wight, to watch the fortune of his Royal Ma&s;ter; he came up by &s;tealth, concealed in the boot of a coach, to take his la&s;t farewell of him; he fell into his arms, and fainted at his feet on the &s;caffold. After Charles's death, he wrote the famous Oceana, and in the work pays a tribute of truth to the virtues of his unfortu|nate Sovereign, and a&s;cribes his misfortunes to the feeble nature of a Monarchy. Mr. Er&s;kine &s;tated the intere&s;ting anecdote, by which he recovered his Oceana from the gripe of Cromwell. He applied to his favourite daughter, and &s;eeing her infant at her &s;ide, he &s;natched it up in his arms, and ran away; alarmed for its fate, the mother followed him&mdash;"I have &s;eized your child," &s;aid Harrington, <Q>your father has &s;eized mine&mdash;I re&s;tore to you your child&mdash;&s;up|plicate your father to re&s;tore my child.</Q> The daughter &s;upplicated, and Cromwell yielded. "If my Government," &s;aid Cromwell, <Q>be made to &s;tand, it will not be battered down by paper &s;hot.</Q> After various other quotations from Monte&s;quieu, Milton, and other cla&s;&s;ics, he made a warm and affecting conclu&s;ion. <Q>Do not think that En|gli&s;hmen are to be bent to your purpo&s;e by this froward cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Be to their fau'ts a little blind&mdash;</L>
<L>Be to their virtues very kind&mdash;</L>
<L>Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</L>
<L>And clap your padlock on the mind.</L></Q>
<P>Engage them by their affections, convince their rea&s;on and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty &s;incere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their true&s;t intere&s;t, and that their form of Government is for their common good. Con&s;traint is the natural parent of re&s;i&s;tance, and this is no new doctrine. In all times where one &s;ide has been tyrannical, the other has been re|fractory. You mu&s;t all remember, Gentlemen, Lucian's plea&s;ant &s;tory&mdash;Jupiter and a countryman were walking together, conver&s;ing with great freedom and familiarity up|on the &s;ubjects of heaven and earth. The countryman li&s;|tened
<PB N="45" REF="46">with attention and acquie&s;cence, while Jupiter &s;trove only to convince him, but happening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned ha&s;tily round, and threatened him with his thunder.&mdash;"Ah! ah!" &s;aid the countryman, <Q>now, Jupi|ter, I know that your are wrong; you're always wrong, when you appeal to your thunder.</Q></P>
<P>The Attorney General ro&s;e to reply; but Mr. Camp|bell, the foreman of the Jury, &s;aid he was in&s;tructed by his brother jurors to &s;ay that he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of any ob&s;ervations, unle&s;s he thought otherwi&s;e him&s;elf, for that they were &s;atisfied. The Attorney General &s;at down, and the Jury immediately gave a verdict of <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
