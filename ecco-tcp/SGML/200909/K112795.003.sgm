<HEAD>TO The Rev. JOSEPH WARTON, D. D. MASTER of WINCHESTER SCHOOL; AND TO The Rev. THOMAS WARTON, B.D. FELLOW of TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIENDS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a conver&s;ation, &s;ome months ago, I happened to mention to you the idea I had long enter|tained of that celebrated Epi&s;tle of Horace, com|monly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of THE ART OF POETRY. I will not &s;ay that you acceded to my opinion; but I flatter my&s;elf that I, in &s;ome degree intere&s;ted your curio&s;ity, and engaged your attention: our di&s;cour&s;e at lea&s;t revived an intention I had once formed, of communicating my thoughts on the &s;ub|ject to the Publick; an intention I had only dropt for want of lei&s;ure and inclination to attempt a tran&s;lation of the Epi&s;tle, which I thought nece&s;&s;ary to accompany the original, and my remarks on it.
<PB N="iv" REF="11">
In the original, Horace a&s;&s;umes the air and &s;tyle of an affectionate teacher, admoni&s;hing and in&s;tructing his young friends and pupils: but the following tran&s;lation, together with the ob&s;ervations annexed, I addre&s;s to You as my Ma&s;ters, from whom I look for &s;ound information, a well-grounded confirmation of my hypothe&s;is, or a &s;olution of my doubts, and a correction of my errors.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the Epi&s;tle in que&s;tion has very particularly exerci&s;ed the critical &s;agacity of the literary world; yet it is remarkable that, amid&s;t the great variety of comments and de|ci&s;ions on the work, it has been almo&s;t univer&s;ally con&s;idered, except by one acute and learned writer of this country, as a loo&s;e, vague, and de&s;ultory com|po&s;ition; a ma&s;s of &s;hining materials; like pearls un&s;trung, valuable indeed, but not di&s;played to ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Some have contended, with Scaliger at their head, that this pretended <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> is totally void of art; and that the very work, in which the beauty and excellence of <HI>Order</HI> (ORDINIS VIRTUS ET VENUS!) is &s;trongly recommended, is in it&s;elf un|connected, confu&s;ed, and immethodical. The ad|vocates
<PB N="v" REF="12">
for the writer have in great mea&s;ure confe&s;&s;ed the charge, but pleaded, in excu&s;e and vindication, the familiarity of an Epi&s;tle, and even the genius of Poetry, in which the formal divi&s;ions of a pro&s;aick treati&s;e on the art would have been in&s;upportable. They have al&s;o denied that Horace ever intended &s;uch a treati&s;e, or that he ever gave to this Epi&s;tle the title of <HI>the Art of Poetry</HI>; on which <HI>title</HI> the at|tacks of Scaliger, and his followers, are chiefly grounded. The title, however, is confe&s;&s;edly as old as the age of Quintilian; and that the work it|&s;elf has a perpetual reference <HI>to Poets and Poetry,</HI> is as evident, as that it is, from beginning to end, in its manner, &s;tyle, addre&s;s, and form, perfectly <HI>Epi&s;tolary.</HI></P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Critick di&s;tingui&s;hed above, an early ornament to letters, and now a worthy dignitary of the church, leaving vain com|ments, and idle di&s;putes on the <HI>title</HI> of the work, &s;agaciou&s;ly directed his re&s;earches to &s;crutinize the work it&s;elf; properly endeavouring to trace and in|ve&s;tigate from the compo&s;ition, the end and de&s;ign of the writer, and remembering the axiom of the Poet, to whom his friend had been appointed the commentator.</P>
<Q><PB N="vi" REF="13">
<L><HI>In every work regard</HI> THE AUTHOR's END!</L>
<L><HI>For none can compa&s;s more than they intend.&mdash;</HI></L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>With this view of illu&s;trating and explaining Horace's Art of Poetry, this &s;hrewd and able writer, about thirty years ago, republi&s;hed the original Epi&s;tle, giving the text chiefly after Dr. Bentley, &s;ubjoining an Engli&s;h Commentary and Notes, and prefixing an Introduction, from which I beg leave to tran&s;cribe mo&s;t part of the three fir&s;t paragraphs.</P>
<Q><P>It is agreed on all hands, that the antients are our ma&s;ters in the <HI>art</HI> of compo&s;ition. Such of their writings, therefore, as deliver in&s;tructions for the exerci&s;e of this <HI>art,</HI> mu&s;t be of the highe&s;t value. And, if any of them hath acquired a credit, in this re&s;pect, &s;uperior to the re&s;t, it is, perhaps, the <HI>following work:</HI> which the learned have long &s;ince con&s;idered as a kind of <HI>&s;ummary</HI> of the rules of good writing; to be gotten by heart by every young &s;tudent; and to who&s;e deci&s;ive authority the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in ta&s;te and compo|&s;ition mu&s;t finally &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>But the more unque&s;tioned the credit of this poem is, the more it will concern the publick, that it be ju&s;tly and accurately under&s;tood. The writer of the&s;e &s;heets then believed it might be of
<PB N="vii" REF="14">
u&s;e, if he took &s;ome pains to clear the &s;en&s;e, con|nect the method, and a&s;certain the &s;cope and pur|po&s;e, of this admired Epi&s;tle. Others, he knew indeed, and &s;ome of the fir&s;t fame for critical learning, had been before him in his attempt. Yet he did not find him&s;elf prevented by their labours; in which, be&s;ides innumerable le&s;&s;er faults, he, more e&s;pecially, ob&s;erved two invete|rate errors, of &s;uch a &s;ort, as mu&s;t needs perplex the genius, and di&s;tre&s;s the learning, of <HI>any</HI> com|mentator. The <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e re&s;pects the SUBJECT; the other, the METHOD of the <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI> It will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething upon each.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> at large, is not the <HI>proper</HI> &s;ubject of this piece, is &s;o apparent, that it hath not e&s;caped the dulle&s;t and lea&s;t attentive of its Criticks. For, however all the different <HI>kinds</HI> of poetry might appear to enter into it, yet every one &s;aw, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> at lea&s;t were very &s;lightly con&s;idered: whence the frequent attempts, the <HI>artes et in&s;titutiones poeticae,</HI> of writers, both at home and abroad, to &s;upply its deficiencies. But, though this truth was &s;een and confe&s;&s;ed, it un|luckily happened, that the &s;agacity of his nume|rous Commentators went no further. They &s;till
<PB N="viii" REF="15">
con&s;idered this famous Epi&s;tle as a <HI>collection,</HI> though not a <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> of critici&s;ms on poetry in ge|neral; with this conce&s;&s;ion, however, that the &s;tage had evidently the large&s;t &s;hare in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Satyra haec e&s;t in &s;ui &s;aeculi poetas, PRAECIPUE vero in Roma|num Drama. <BIBL>Baxter.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Under the influence of this prejudice, &s;everal writers of name took upon them to comment and explain it: and with the &s;ucce&s;s, which was to be ex|pected from &s;o fatal a mi&s;take on &s;etting out, as the not &s;eeing, <Q REND="inline">'that the proper and &s;ole pur|po&s;e of the Author, was, not to abridge the Greek Criticks, whom he probably never thought of; nor to amu&s;e him&s;elf with compo&s;ing a &s;hort criti|cal &s;y&s;tem, for the general u&s;e of poets, which every line of it ab&s;olutely confutes; but, &s;imply to criticize the ROMAN DRAMA.'</Q> For to this end, not the tenor of the work only, but as will appear, every &s;ingle precept in it, ultimately re|fers. The mi&s;chiefs of this original error have been long felt. It hath occa&s;ioned a con&s;tant perplexity in defining the <HI>general</HI> method, and in fixing the import of <HI>particular</HI> rules. Nay, its effects have reached &s;till further. For conceiving, as they did, that the whole had been compo&s;ed out of the Greek Criticks, the labour and ingenuity
<PB N="ix" REF="16">
of its interpreters have been mi&s;employed in picking out authorities, which were not wanted, and in producing, or, more properly, by their &s;tudied refinements in <HI>creating,</HI> conformities, which were never de&s;igned. Whence it hath come to pa&s;s, that, in&s;tead of inve&s;tigating the order of the Poet's own reflexions, and &s;cru|tinizing the peculiar &s;tate of the Roman Stage (the methods, which common &s;en&s;e, and common critici&s;m would pre&s;cribe) the world hath been nau&s;eated with in&s;ipid lectures on <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Phalereus</HI>; who&s;e &s;olid &s;en&s;e hath been &s;o attenu|ated and &s;ubtilized by the delicate operation of French critici&s;m, as hath even gone &s;ome way to|wards bringing the <HI>art</HI> it&s;elf into di&s;repute.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the wrong explications of this poem have ari&s;en, not from the mi&s;conception of the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> only, but from an inattention to the METHOD of it. The <HI>latter</HI> was, in part, the ge|nuine con&s;equence of the <HI>former.</HI> For, not &s;u&s;|pecting an unity of de&s;ign in the &s;ubject, its in|terpreters never looked for, or could never find, a con&s;i&s;tency of di&s;po&s;ition in the method. And this was indeed the very block upon which HEINSIUS, and, before him, JULIUS SCALIGER,
<PB N="x" REF="17">
him&s;elf &s;tumbled. The&s;e illu&s;trious Criticks, with all the force of genius, which is required to di&s;|embarra&s;s an involved &s;ubject, and all the aids of learning, that can lend a ray to enlighten a dark one, have, notwith&s;tanding, found them&s;elves utterly unable to unfold the order of this Epi&s;tle; in&s;omuch, that SCALIGER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praef. in LIB. POET. et l. vi. p. 338.</NOTE> hath boldly pro|nounced the conduct of it to be <HI>vicious</HI>; and HEIN|SIUS had no other way to evade the charge, than by recurring to the forced and uncritical expedient of a licentious tran&s;po&s;ition. The truth is, they were both in one common error, that the Poet's purpo&s;e had been to write a critici&s;m of the Art of Poetry at large, and not, as is here &s;hewn, of the Roman Drama in particular.</P></Q>
<P>The remainder of this Introduction, as well as the Commentary and Notes, afford ample proofs of the erudition and ingenuity of the Critick; yet I much doubt, whether he has been able to convince the learned world of the truth of his main propo&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"that it was the proper and &s;ole purpo&s;e of the Au|thor, &s;imply <HI>to critici&s;e the</HI> ROMAN DRAMA."</Q> His Commentary is, it mu&s;t be owned, extremely &s;educ|ing; yet the attentive reader of Horace will perhaps
<PB N="xi" REF="18">
often fancy, that he perceives a violence and con|&s;traint offered to the compo&s;ition, in order to ac|commodate it to the &s;y&s;tem of the Commentator; who, to &s;uch a reader, may perhaps &s;eem to mark tran&s;itions, and point out connections, as well as to maintain <HI>a method</HI> in the Commentary, which cannot clearly be deduced from the text, to which it refers.</P>
<P>This very ingenious <HI>Commentary</HI> opens as fol|lows:</P>
<Q><P>The &s;ubject of this piece being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>one,</HI> viz. <HI>the &s;tate of the Roman Drama,</HI> and com|mon &s;en&s;e requiring, even in the free&s;t forms of compo&s;ition, &s;ome kind of <HI>method,</HI> the intelligent reader will not be &s;urprized to find the poet pro&s;e|cuting his &s;ubject in a regular, well-ordered <HI>plan</HI>; which, for the more exact de&s;cription of it, I di&s;tingui&s;h into three parts:</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t of them [from l. 1 to 89] is prepa|ratory to the main &s;ubject of the Epi&s;tle, con|taining &s;ome general rules and reflections on poetry, but principally with an eye to the follow|ing parts: by which means it &s;erves as an u&s;eful introduction to the poet's de&s;ign, and opens with that air of ea&s;e and elegance, e&s;&s;ential to the epi|&s;tolary form.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="xii" REF="19">II. The main body of the Epi&s;tle [from l. 89 to 295] is laid out in regulating the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tage; but chiefly in giving rules for Tragedy; not only as that was the &s;ublimer &s;pecies of the <HI>Drama,</HI> but, as it &s;hould &s;eem, le&s;s cultivated and under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="3">III. The la&s;t part [from l. 295 to the end] ex|horts to correctne&s;s in writing; yet &s;till with an eye, principally, to the <HI>dramatick &s;pecies:</HI> and is taken up partly in removing the cau&s;es, that pre|vented it; and partly in directing to the u&s;e of &s;uch means, as might &s;erve to promote it. Such is the general plan of the Epi&s;tle.</P></Q>
<P>In this general &s;ummary, with which the Critick introduces his particular Commentary, a very mate|rial circum&s;tance is acknowledged, which perhaps tends to render the &s;y&s;tem on which it proceeds, ex|tremely doubtful, if not wholly untenable. The original Epi&s;tle con&s;i&s;ts of four hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix lines; and it appears, from the above numerical analy&s;is, that not half of tho&s;e lines, only two hun|dred and &s;ix ver&s;es [from v. 89 to 295] are employed on the &s;ubject of <HI>the Roman Stage.</HI> The fir&s;t of the three parts above delineated [from v. 1 to 89] cer|tainly
<PB N="xiii" REF="20">
<HI>contains general rules and re&s;trictions on poetry,</HI> but &s;urely with no particular reference to the Drama. As to the &s;econd part, the Critick, I think, might fairly have extended the Poet's con&s;ideration of the Drama to the 365th line, &s;eventy lines further than he has carried it: but the la&s;t hundred and eleven lines of the Epi&s;tle &s;o little allude to the Drama, that the only pa&s;&s;age in which a mention of the Stage has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be implied, [<HI>ludu&s;que repertus, &amp;c.</HI>] is, by the learned and ingenious Critick him&s;elf, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed with a very different inter|pretation. Nor can this portion of the Epi&s;tle be con&s;idered, by the impartial and intelligent reader, as a mere exhortation <Q REND="inline">"to correctne&s;s in writing; taken up partly in removing the cau&s;es that pre|vented it; and partly in directing to the u&s;e of &s;uch means, as might &s;erve to promote it."</Q> <HI>Correctne&s;s</HI> is indeed here, as in many other parts of Horace's Satires and Epi&s;tles, occa&s;ionally inculcated; but &s;urely the main &s;cope of this animated conclu&s;ion is to deter tho&s;e, who are not ble&s;t with genius, from attempting the walks of Poetry.</P>
<P>I much approve what this writer has urged on the <HI>unity of &s;ubject, and beauty of epi&s;tolary method</HI> ob&s;erved in this Work; but cannot agree that <Q REND="inline">"the main
<PB N="xiv" REF="21">
&s;ubject and intention was <HI>the regulation of the Roman Stage.</HI>"</Q> How far I may differ concerning particu|lar pa&s;&s;ages, will appear from the notes at the end of this tran&s;lation. In controver&s;ial critici&s;m differ|ence of opinion cannot but be expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>(veniam petimu&s;que damu&s;que vici&s;&s;im,)</HI> but I hope I &s;hall not be thought to have delivered my &s;entiments with petulance, or be accu&s;ed of want of re&s;pect for a character, that I mo&s;t &s;incerely reverence and ad|mire.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;et down in writing, the &s;ub|&s;tance of what I &s;ugge&s;ted to you in conver&s;ation, concerning my own conceptions of the end and de|&s;ign of Horace in this Epi&s;tle. In this explanation I &s;hall call upon Horace as my chief witne&s;s, and the Epi&s;tle it&s;elf, as my principal voucher. Should their te&s;timonies prove adver&s;e, my &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be aban|doned, like many that have preceded it, as vain and chimerical: and if it &s;hould even, by their &s;upport, be acknowledged and received, it will, I think, like the egg of Columbus, appear &s;o plain, ea&s;y, and obvious, that it will &s;eem almo&s;t wonderful, that the Epi&s;tle has never been con&s;idered in the &s;ame light, till now. I do not wi&s;h to dazzle with the lu&s;tre of a new hypothe&s;is, which requires, I think,
<PB N="xv" REF="22">
neither the &s;trong opticks, nor powerful gla&s;&s;es, of a critical Her&s;chel, to a&s;certain the truth of it; but is a &s;y&s;tem, that lies level to common apprehen&s;ion, and a luminary, di&s;coverable by the naked eye.</P>
<P>My notion is &s;imply this. I conceive that one of the &s;ons of Pi&s;o, undoubtedly the Elder, had either written, or meditated, a poetical work, mo&s;t proba|bly a Tragedy; and that he had, with the know|ledge of the family, communicated his piece, or in|tention, to Horace: but Horace, either di&s;approving of the work, or doubting of the poetical faculties of the Elder Pi&s;o, or both, wi&s;hed to di&s;&s;uade him from all thoughts of publication. With this view he formed the de&s;ign of writing this Epi&s;tle, addre&s;&s;ing it, with a courtline&s;s and delicacy perfectly agree|able to his acknowledged character, indifferently to the whole family, the father and his two &s;ons. <HI>Epi|&s;tola ad Pi&s;ones, de Arte Poetic&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>He begins with general reflections, generally ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his <HI>three</HI> friends. <HI>Credite,</HI> PISONES!&mdash;PATER, <HI>&amp;</HI> JUVENES <HI>patre digni!</HI>&mdash;In the&s;e prelimi|nary rules, equally nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by Poets of every denomination, he dwells on the nece&s;&s;ity of unity of de&s;ign, the danger of being dazzled by the
<PB N="xvi" REF="23">
&s;plendor of partial beauties, the choice of &s;ubjects, the beauty of order, the elegance and propriety of diction, and the u&s;e of a thorough knowledge of the nature of the &s;everal different &s;pecies of Poetry: &s;umming up this introductory portion of his Epi&s;tle, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<Q><L><HI>De&s;criptas &s;ervare vices, operumque colores,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cur ego &s;i nequeo ignoroque, poeta &s;alutor?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cur ne&s;cire, pudens prav&egrave;, quam di&s;cere malo?</HI></L></Q>
<P>From this general view of poetry, on the canvas of Ari&s;totle, but entirely after his own manner, the writer proceeds to give the rules and hi&s;tory of the Drama; adverting principally to Tragedy, with all its con&s;tituents and appendages of diction, fable, character, incidents, chorus, mea&s;ure, mu&s;ick, and decoration. In this part of the work, according to the interpretation of the be&s;t Criticks, and indeed (I think) according to the manife&s;t tenor of the Epi&s;tle, he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf entirely to <HI>the two young gentlemen,</HI> pointing out to them the difficulty, as well as ex|cellence, of the Dramatick Art; in&s;i&s;ting on the avowed &s;uperiority of the Graecian Writers, and a&s;cribing the comparative failure of the Romans to negligence and avarice. The Poet, having
<PB N="xvii" REF="24">
exhau&s;ted this part of his &s;ubject, &s;uddenly drops a <HI>&s;econd,</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ing at once no le&s;s than <HI>two</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> Per&s;ons, to whom he originally addre&s;&s;ed his Epi&s;tle, and turning &s;hort on <HI>the</HI> ELDER PISO, mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitate publications, and the ridicule to which the author of wretched poetry expo&s;es him&s;elf. From the com|mencement of this partial addre&s;s, O MAJOR JUVE|NUM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [v. 366] to the end of the poem, <HI>almo&s;t a fourth part of the whole,</HI> the &s;econd per&s;on plural, <HI>Pi&s;ones!&mdash;Vos!&mdash;Vos, O Pompilius Sanguis!</HI> &amp;c. is di&s;carded, and the &s;econd per&s;on &s;ingular, <HI>Tu, Te, Tibi,</HI> &amp;c. invariably takes its place. The argu|ments too are equally relative and per&s;onal; not only &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tudy, combined with natural genius, to con&s;titute a Poet; but dwelling on the peculiar danger and delu&s;ion of flattery, to a writer of rank and fortune; as well as the ine&s;tima|ble value of an hone&s;t friend, to re&s;cue him from de|ri&s;ion and contempt. The Poet, however, in reve|rence to the Mu&s;e, qualifies his exaggerated de&s;cription of an infatuated &s;cribbler, with a mo&s;t noble enco|mium on the u&s;es of Good Poetry, vindicating the dignity of the Art, and proudly a&s;&s;erting, that the mo&s;t exalted characters would not be di&s;graced by the cultivation of it.</P>
<Q><PB N="xviii" REF="25">
<L><HI>Ne forte pudori</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sit</HI> tibi <HI>Mu&s;a, lyrae &s;olers, &amp; Cantor Apollo.</HI></L></Q>
<P>It is worthy ob&s;ervation, that in the &s;atyrical picture of a frantick bard, with which Horace con|cludes his Epi&s;tle, he not only runs counter to what might be expected as a Corollary of an E&s;&s;ay on <HI>the Art of Poetry,</HI> but contradicts his own u&s;ual practice and &s;entiments. In his Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, in&s;tead of &s;tigmatizing the love of ver&s;e as an abominable phren&s;y, he calls it <HI>(levis haec in&s;ania) a &s;light mad|ne&s;s,</HI> and de&s;cants on its good effects&mdash;<HI>quantas</HI> VIR|TUTES <HI>habeat, &s;ic collige!</HI></P>
<P>In another Epi&s;tle, &s;peaking of him&s;elf, and his addiction to poetry, he &s;ays,

<L><HI>Illudo chartis; hoc e&s;t,</HI> MEDIOCRIBUS ILLIS</L>
<L><HI>Ex vitiis unum,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>All which, and &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages in his works, almo&s;t demon&s;trate that it was not, without a par|ticular purpo&s;e in view, that he dwelt &s;o forcibly on the de&s;cription of a man re&s;olved
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;in &s;pite</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of nature and his &s;tars to write.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="26">To conclude, if I have not contemplated my &s;y&s;tem, till I am become blind to its imperfections, this view of the Epi&s;tle not only pre&s;erves to it all that <HI>unity of &s;ubject, and elegance of method,</HI> &s;o much in|&s;i&s;ted on by the excellent Critick, to whom I have &s;o often referred; but by adding to his judicious general ab&s;tract the familiarities of per&s;onal addre&s;s, &s;o &s;trongly marked by the writer, &s;carce a line ap|pears idle or mi&s;placed: while the order and di&s;po|&s;ition of the Epi&s;tle to the Pi&s;os appears as evident and unembarra&s;&s;ed, as that of the Epi&s;tle to Au|gu&s;tus; in which la&s;t, the actual &s;tate of the Roman Drama &s;eems to have been more manife&s;tly the object of Horace's attention, than in the Work now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Before I leave you to the further examination of the original of Horace, and &s;ubmit to you the Tran&s;lation, with the Notes that accompany it, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the &s;y&s;tem, which I have here laid down, is not &s;o entirely new, as it may perhaps at fir&s;t appear to the reader, or as I my&s;elf originally &s;uppo&s;ed it. No Critick indeed has, to my know|ledge, directly con&s;idered <HI>the whole Epi&s;tle</HI> in the &s;ame light that I have now taken it; but yet <HI>parti|cular pa&s;&s;ages</HI> &s;eem &s;o &s;trongly to enforce &s;uch an
<PB N="xx" REF="27">
interpretation, that the Editors, Tran&s;lators, and Commentators, have been occa&s;ionally driven to ex|planations of a &s;imilar tendency; of which the Notes annexed will exhibit &s;everal &s;triking in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Of the following ver&s;ion I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I have not, knowingly, adopted a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, tending to warp the judgement of the learned or un|learned reader, in favour of my own hypothe&s;is. I attempted this tran&s;lation, chiefly becau&s;e I could find no other equally clo&s;e and literal. Even the Ver&s;ion of Ro&s;common, though in blank ver&s;e, is in &s;ome parts a paraphra&s;e, and in others, but an ab|&s;tract. I have my&s;elf, indeed, endeavoured to &s;up|port my right to that force and freedom of tran&s;lation which Horace him&s;elf recommends; yet I have faithfully exhibited in our language &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, which his profe&s;&s;ed tran&s;lators have abandoned, as impo&s;&s;ible to be given in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>All I think nece&s;&s;ary to be further &s;aid on the Epi&s;tle, will appear in the Notes.</P>

<HEAD>THE ART of POETRY, an EPISTLE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Q. HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLA AD PISONES.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="title" TYPE="note">
<P>THE work of Horace, now under con&s;ideration, has been &s;o long known, and &s;o generally received, by the name of <HI>The Art of Poetry,</HI> that I have, on account of that notoriety, &s;ubmitted this tran&s;lation to the Publick, under that title, rather than what I hold to be the true one, <HI>viz. Horace's</HI> EPISTLE TO THE PISOS. The Author of the Engli&s;h Commen|tary has adopted the &s;ame title, though directly re|pugnant to his own &s;y&s;tem; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, for the very &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The title, in general a matter of indifference, is, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, of much con&s;equence. On the title Julius Scaliger founded his invidious, and injudicious, attack. <HI>De arte quaeres quid &s;entiam. Quid? equidem quod</HI> DE ARTE, SINE ARTE <HI>tradit&acirc;.</HI> To <HI>ehe Title</HI> all the editors, and commentators, have
<PB N="38" REF="96">
particularly adverted; commonly preferring the Epi&s;tolary Denomination, but, in contradiction to that preference, almo&s;t univer&s;ally in&s;cribing the Epi&s;tle, <HI>the Art of Poetry.</HI> The conduct, however, of JASON DE NORES, a native of Cyprus, a learned and ingenious writer of the 16th century, is very remarkable. In the year 1553 he publi&s;hed at Ve|nice this work of Horace, accompanied with a com|mentary and notes, written in elegant Latin, in|&s;cribing it, after Quintilian, <HI>Q. Horatii Flacci</HI> LIBER DE ARTE POETICA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think it right to mention that I have never &s;een the fir&s;t edition, pub|li&s;hed at Venice. With a copy of the &s;econd edition, printed at Paris, I was favoured by Dr. Warton of Winche&s;ter.</NOTE>. The very next year, how|ever, he printed at Paris a &s;econd edition, enriching his notes with many ob&s;ervations on Dante and Pe|trarch, and changing the title, after mature con&s;i|deration, to <HI>Q. Horatii Flacci</HI> EPISTOLA AD PISONES, <HI>de Arte Poetic&acirc;.</HI> His motives for this change he a&s;|&s;igns in the following terms.</P>

<P>Julius Scaliger certainly &s;tands convicted of cri|tical malice by his poor cavil at <HI>the</HI> SUPPOSED <HI>title</HI>;
<PB N="40" REF="98">
and has betrayed his ignorance of the ea&s;e and beauty of Epi&s;tolary method, as well as the mo&s;t gro&s;s mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion, by his ridiculous analy&s;is of the work, re&s;olving it into thirty-&s;ix parts. He &s;eems, how|ever, to have not ill conceived the genius of the poem, in &s;aying that <HI>it reli&s;hed of</HI> SATIRE. This he has urged in many parts of his Poeticks, parti|cularly in the Dedicatory Epi&s;tle to his &s;on, not omitting, however, his con&s;tant charge of <HI>Art with|out Art. Horatius</HI> ARTEM <HI>cum in&s;crip&s;it,</HI> ADEO SINE ULLA DOCET ARTE, UT SATYRAE PROPIUS TOTUM OPUS ILLUD ESSE VIDEATUR. This comes almo&s;t home to the opinion of the Author of the elegant commentaries on the two Epi&s;tles of Horace to the Pi&s;os and to Augu&s;tus, as expre&s;&s;ed in the Dedica|cation to the latter: With the recital of that opinion I &s;hall conclude this long note. <Q REND="inline">"The genius of Rome was bold and elevated: but Critici&s;m of any kind, was little cultivated, never profe&s;&s;ed as an <HI>art,</HI> by this people.

<Q>From reflections on <HI>poetry, at large,</HI> he pro|ceeds now to <HI>particulars:</HI> the mo&s;t obvious of
<PB N="55" REF="113">
which being the different <HI>forms</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> of poetick compo&s;ition, he con&s;iders, in this view, [from v. 75 to 86] the four great &s;pecies of po|etry, to which all others may be reduced, <HI>the Epick, Elegiack, Dramatick, and Lyrick.</HI> But the di&s;tinction of the <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> to be ob&s;erved in the &s;everal &s;pecies is &s;o obvious, that there can &s;carcely be any mi&s;take about them.

To ex|plain this, which is a point of great nicety, he con&s;iders [from v. 89 to 99] the ca&s;e of Drama|tick Poetry; the two &s;pecies of which are as di|&s;tinct from each other, as any two can be, and yet there are times, when the features of the one will be allowed to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the other.&mdash;But the Poet had a further view in chu&s;ing this in&s;tance. For he gets by this means into the main of his &s;ubject, which was Dramatick Poetry, and, by the mo&s;t delicate tran&s;ition imaginable, proceeds [from 89 to 323] to deliver a &s;eries of rules, inter&s;per&s;ed with hi&s;torical accounts, <HI>and enlivened by digre&s;&s;ions,</HI> for the regulation of the ROMAN STAGE.</Q>

to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the New Greek Comedy; from whence he pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily and gracefully, to <HI>the</HI> ROMAN STAGE, acknowledging the merits of the Writers, but pointing out their defects, and a&s;&s;ign|ing the cau&s;es.

Nor let any one &s;ay, that the au|dience is well able to do this for it&s;elf: Euripides did not find even an Athenian theatre &s;o quick|&s;ighted. The &s;tory is well known, [Sen. Ep. 115.] that when this painter of the <HI>manners</HI> was obliged, by the rules of his art, and the character to be &s;u&s;tained, to put a run of bold &s;entiments in the mouth of one of his per&s;ons, the people in&s;tantly took fire, charging the poet with the <HI>imputed</HI> vil|lainy, as though it had been his <HI>own.</HI> Now if

&s;uch an audience could &s;o ea&s;ily mi&s;interpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet, and this too, when a Chorus was at hand to correct and di&s;abu&s;e their judg|ments, what mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, when the <HI>whole</HI> is left to the &s;agacity and penetration of the people?

<P>Mon&s;ieur Dacier, as well as the author of the above note, cen&s;ures the modern &s;tage for having rejected <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, and having lo&s;t thereby <HI>at lea&s;t half its probability, and its</HI> GREATEST ORNAMENT; &s;o that our Tragedy is <HI>but a very faint &s;hadow of the</HI> OLD.

I would here be under&s;tood to &s;peak chiefly of the moderns. For the antients, though it has not been attended to, had &s;ome peculiar advantages over us in this re&s;pect, re&s;ulting from the princi|ples and practices of tho&s;e times. For, as it hath been ob&s;erved of the ancient Epic Mu&s;e, that &s;he borrowed much of her &s;tate and dignity from the fal&s;e <HI>theology</HI> of the pagan world, &s;o, I think, it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the ancient tragic, that &s;he has derived great advantages of probability from its mi&s;taken <HI>moral.</HI> If there be truth in this re|flection, it will help to ju&s;tify &s;ome of the ancient choirs, that have been mo&s;t objected to by the moderns.</Q>

<Q>In &s;um, though the&s;e acts of &s;evere avenging ju&s;tice might not be according to the expre&s;s letter of the laws, or the more refined conclu&s;ions of the PORCH or ACADEMY; yet there is no doubt, that they were, in the general account, e&s;teemed

fit and rea&s;onable. And, it is to be ob&s;erved, in order to pa&s;s a right judgment on the ancient Chorus, that, though in virtue of their office, they were obliged univer&s;ally to &s;u&s;tain a moral character; yet this moral was rather political and popular, than &s;trictly legal or philo&s;ophic. Which is al&s;o founded on good rea&s;on. The &s;cope and end of the ancient theatre being to &s;erve the in|tere&s;ts of virtue and &s;ociety, on the principles and &s;entiments, already &s;pread and admitted among&s;t the people, and not to correct old errors, and in|&s;truct them in philo&s;ophic truth.</Q>
<P>One of the cen&s;urers of Euripides, who&s;e opinion is controverted in the above note, is Mon&s;ieur Da|cier; who condemns <HI>the</HI> CHORUS in this in&s;tance, as not only violating their <HI>moral</HI> office, but <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of</HI> NATURE <HI>and of</HI> GOD, <HI>by a fidelity</HI> so VICIOUS and CRIMINAL, <HI>that the&s;e women,</HI> [<HI>the</HI> CHORUS!] <HI>ought to fly away in the Car of Medea, to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment due to them.</HI> The Annotator above, agrees with the Greek Scholia&s;t, that <HI>the Co|rinthian women</HI> (<HI>the</HI> CHORUS) <HI>being free,</HI> properly de&s;ert the intere&s;ts of Creon, and keep Medea's &s;e|crets, <HI>for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice,</HI> according to their cu&s;tom.

<P>The above interpretation of this part of the Epi&s;tle is, in my opinion, extremely ju&s;t, and exactly cor|re&s;ponds with the explication of De Nores, who cen|&s;ures Madius for an error &s;imilar to that of Dacier. <HI>Non rect&egrave; &s;entire videtur Madius, dum putat potius</HI> IN ROMANORUM LUXURIAM <HI>invectum Horatium, quam</HI> DE MELODIAE INCREMENTO <HI>tracta&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE MUSICK, having always been a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, I cannot (as has already been hinted in the note on l. 100 of this ver&s;ion) con&s;ider the Poet's notice of the Pipe and Lyre, as a <HI>digre&s;&s;ion,</HI> notwith&s;tanding it includes a &s;hort hi&s;+tory of the rude &s;implicity of the Mu&s;ick in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> earlier ages of Rome, and of its &s;ub&s;equent improve|ments. <HI>The</HI> CHORUS too, being originally <HI>the whole</HI> as well as afterwards a legitimate <HI>part</HI> of Tragedy, the Poet naturally traces the Drama from its origin to its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate in Greece; and afterwards compares its progre&s;s and improvements with the

<P>The&s;e lines, rather breaking in upon the continuity of the hi&s;tory of theatrical mu&s;ick, create &s;ome ob|&s;curity, which has given birth to various interpreta|tions.

M. <HI>Dacier</HI> hath I know not what conceit about a compari&s;on be|twixt the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> &s;tage. His rea&s;on is, <HI>that the lyre was u&s;ed in the Greek Chorus, as appears,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>from Sophocles him&s;elf playing upon this in|&s;trument him&s;elf in one of his tragedies.</HI> And was it not u&s;ed too in the Roman Chorus, as appears from Nero's playing upon it in &s;everal tragedies? But the learned critic did not apprehend this matter. Indeed from the caution, with which his guides, the dealers in antiquities, always touch this point, it &s;hould &s;eem, that they too had no very clear conceptions of it. The ca&s;e I take to have been this: The <HI>tibia,</HI> as being mo&s;t proper to accompany the declamation of the acts, <HI>can|tanti &s;uccinere,</HI> was con&s;tantly employed, as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy. This appears from many authorities. I mention only two from
<PB N="86" REF="148">
Cicero. <HI>Quam multa</HI> [Acad. l. ii. 7.] <HI>quae nos fu|giunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati: Qui primo inflatu Tibicinis, Antiopam e&s;&s;e aiunt aut An|dromacham, cum nos ne &s;u&s;picemur quidem.</HI> The other is &s;till more expre&s;s. In his piece entitled <HI>Orator,</HI> &s;peaking of the negligence of the Roman writers, in re&s;pect of <HI>numbers,</HI> he ob&s;erves, <HI>that there were even many pa&s;&s;ages in their tragedies, which, unle&s;s the</HI> TIBIA <HI>played to them, could not be dl&s;tingui&s;hed from mere pro&s;e: quae, ni&s;i cum Ti|bicen acce&s;&s;erit, orationi &s;int &s;olutoe &s;imillima.</HI> One of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages is expre&s;sly quoted from <HI>Thye&s;tes,</HI> a tragedy of <HI>Ennius</HI>; and, as appears from the mea&s;ure, taken out of one of the acts. It is clear then, that the <HI>tibia</HI> was certainly u&s;ed in the <HI>de|clamation</HI> of tragedy. But now the &s;ong of the tragic chorus, being of the nature of the ode, of cour&s;e required <HI>fides,</HI> the lyre, the peculiar and appropriated in&s;trument of the lyric mu&s;e. And this is clearly collected, if not from expre&s;s te&s;|timonies; yet from &s;ome occa&s;ional hints dropt by the antients. For, 1. the lyre, we are told, [Cic. De Leg. ii. 9 &amp; 15.] and is agreed on all hands, was an in&s;trument of the Roman theatre; but it was not employed in comedy. This we certainly know from the &s;hort account of the
<PB N="87" REF="149">
mu&s;ic prefixed to Terence's plays. 2. Further, the <HI>tibicen,</HI> as we &s;aw, accompanied the declama|tion of the acts in tragedy. It remains then, that the proper place of the lyre was, where one &s;hould naturally look for it, in the &s;ongs of the Chorus; but we need not go further than this very pa&s;&s;age for a proof. It is unque&s;tionable, that the poet is here &s;peaking of the Chorus only; the following lines not admitting any other po&s;&s;ible interpreta|tion. By <HI>fidibus</HI> then is nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tood the in&s;trument peculiarly u&s;ed in it. Not that it need be &s;aid that the <HI>tibia</HI> was never u&s;ed in the Chorus. The contrary &s;eems expre&s;&s;ed in a pa&s;&s;age of Se|neca, [Ep. lxxxiv.] and in Julius Pollux [l. iv. 15: &sect; 107.] It is &s;ufficient, if the <HI>lyre</HI> was u&s;ed &s;ole|ly, or principally, in it at this time. In this view, the whole digre&s;&s;ion is more pertinent, and con|nects better. The poet had before been &s;peaking of tragedy. All his directions from l. 100, re&s;pect this &s;pecies of the drama only. The application of what he had &s;aid concerning mu&s;ic, is then mo&s;t naturally made, 1. to the <HI>tibia,</HI> the mu&s;ic of the acts; and, 2. to <HI>fides,</HI> that of the choir: thus confining him&s;elf, as the tenor of this part re|quired, to tragedy only. Hence is &s;een the mi&s;|take, not only of M. Dacier, who&s;e comment is
<PB N="88" REF="150">

It is further to be ob&s;erved, that, in the applica|tion here made, be&s;ides the mu&s;ic, the poet takes in the other improvements of the Tragic Chorus, the&s;e happening, as from the nature of the thing they would do, at the &s;ame time.</P> <BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>

Only it will be proper to ob|&s;erve one or two particulars, which have been greatly mi&s;under&s;tood, and without which it will be impo&s;&s;ible, in any tolerable manner, to explain what follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. The de&s;ign of the poet, in the&s;e lines, is not to fix the origin of the &s;atyric piece, in a&s;cribing
<PB N="92" REF="154">
the invention of it to The&s;pis. This hath been concluded, without the lea&s;t warrant from his own words, which barely tell us, <Q REND="inline">"that the repre&s;en|tation of tragedy was in elder Greece followed by the <HI>&s;atires</HI>;"</Q> and indeed the nature of the thing, as well as the te&s;timony of all antiquity, &s;hews it to be impo&s;&s;ible. For the <HI>&s;atire</HI> here &s;poken of is, in all re&s;pects, a regular drama, and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of Ae&s;|chylus, when the con&s;titution of the drama was fir&s;t formed. It is true indeed, there was a kind of entertainment of much greater antiquity, which by the antients is &s;ometimes called <HI>&s;atyric,</HI> out of which (as Ari&s;totle a&s;&s;ures us) tragedy it&s;elf aro&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> But then this was nothing but a Chorus of &s;atyrs [Athenaeus, l. xiv.] celebrating the fe&s;tivals of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> with rude &s;ongs and un|couth dances; and had little re&s;emblance to that which was afterwards called <HI>&s;atiric</HI>; which, ex|cept that it retained the Chorus of &s;atyrs, and turned upon &s;ome &s;ubject relative to Bacchus, was of a quite different &s;tructure, and, in every re&s;pect, as regular a compo&s;ition as tragedy it|&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="93" REF="155">II. There is no doubt but the poem, here di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of SATYRI, was in actual u&s;e on the Roman &s;tage. This appears from the turn of the poet's whole critici&s;m upon it. Par|ticularly, his addre&s;s to the Pi&s;os, l. 235 and his ob&s;ervation of the offence which a loo&s;e dialogue in this drama would give to a <HI>Roman</HI> auditory, l. 248, make it evident that he had, in fact, the practice of his own &s;tage in view.</P>
<P N="3">III. For the ab&s;olute merit of the&s;e &s;atires, the reader will judge of it him&s;elf by comparing the Cyclops, the only piece of this kind remaining to us from antiquity, with the rules here delivered by Horace. Only it may be ob&s;erved, in addition to what the reader will find el&s;ewhere [<HI>n.</HI> l. 223.] apologized in its favour, that the double character of the &s;atires admirably fitted it, as well for a &s;en|&s;ible entertainment to the wi&s;e, as for the &s;port and diver&s;ion of the vulgar. For, while the grote&s;que appearance and je&s;ting vein of the&s;e fanta&s;tic per|&s;onages amu&s;ed the one, the other &s;aw much fur|ther; and con&s;idered them, at the &s;ame time, as replete with &s;cience, and informed by a &s;pirit of the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e wi&s;dom.

affairs, or a high, refined moral, might, with the highe&s;t probability, be in&s;inuated, under the &s;light cover of a ru&s;tic &s;implicity. And from this in|&s;tructive ca&s;t, which from its nature mu&s;t be very ob&s;cure, if not impenetrable, to us at this day, was, I doubt not, derived the principal plea&s;ure which the antients found in this &s;pecies of the drama. If the modern reader would conceive any thing of the nature and degree of this plea&s;ure, he may in part gue&s;s at it, from reflecting on the entertainment he him&s;elf receives from the cha|racters of the clowns in Shake&s;peare; <HI>who,</HI> as the poet him&s;elf hath characterized them, <HI>u&s;e their folly, like a &s;talking hor&s;e, and, under the pre&s;entation of that, &s;hoot their wit.</HI> [As you like it.]&mdash;</P><BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>This learned note, I think, &s;ets out with a mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion of the meaning of Horace, by involv|ing his <HI>in&s;tructions</HI> on THE SATYRICK DRAMA, with his account of its <HI>Origin.</HI> Nor does he, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, in&s;inuate, tho' Dacier has a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame thing, that <HI>the</HI> SATYRS owed their fir&s;t in|troduction to <HI>The&s;pis</HI>; but relates, that the very Poets, who contended in <HI>the Goat-Song,</HI> to which TRAGEDY owes its name, finding it too &s;olemn and &s;evere
<PB N="95" REF="157">
an entertainment for their rude holiday audience, inter&s;per&s;ed the grave &s;trains of tragedy with comick and <HI>&s;atyrical</HI> Interludes, producing thereby a kind of medley, &s;omething congenial to what has appeared on our own &s;tage, under the name of TRAGI-COMEDY. Nor, if I am able to read and comprehend the con|text, do the words of Horace tell us, <Q REND="inline">"that the re|pre&s;entation of Tragedy was, in elder Greece, <HI>followed</HI> by <HI>the</HI> SATYRS."</Q> The Satyrs compo&s;ed a part of the Tragedy in its infancy, as well as in the days of Horace, if his own words may be quoted as authority. On any other con&s;truction, his direc|tions, concerning the conduct of the <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Hero</HI> of the piece, are &s;carcely reconcilable to common &s;en&s;e; and it is almost impo&s;&s;ible to mark their being incorporated with the Tragedy, in more expre&s;&s;ive terms or images, than by his &s;ollicitude to prevent their broad mirth from contaminating its dignity or purity.</P>

<P><HI>The</HI> CYCLOPS of Euripides, the only SATYRICK DRAMA extant, written at a much later period, than
<PB N="96" REF="158">
that of which Horace &s;peaks in this place, cannot, I think, convey to us a very exact idea of <HI>the Tragick Pa&s;torals,</HI> who&s;e <HI>origin</HI> he here de&s;cribes. <HI>The</HI> CY|CLOPS, &s;carce exceeding 700 lines, might be played, according to the idea of &s;ome criticks, after another performance: but that cannot, without the greate&s;t violence to the text, be &s;uppo&s;ed of the &s;atyrick piece here mentioned by Horace. The idea of <HI>farces,</HI> or <HI>after-pieces,</HI> tho' an inferior branch of the Drama, is, in fact, among the refinements of an improved age. The writers of an early period throw their dra|matick materials, &s;erious and ludicrous, into one ma&s;s; which the critical chymi&s;try of &s;ucceeding times &s;eparates and refines. The modern &s;tage, like the antient, owed its birth to the ceremonies of Religion. From <HI>My&s;teries</HI> and <HI>Moralities,</HI> it pro|ceeded to more regular Dramas, diver&s;ifying their &s;erious &s;cenes, like <HI>the</HI> SATYRICK POETS, with lu|dicrous repre&s;entations. This de&s;ire of <HI>variety</HI> was one cau&s;e of the <HI>irregularity,</HI> as well as extraordi|nary <HI>length</HI> of their pieces; of which, I believe, they never gave above <HI>one</HI> at the &s;ame time of repre|&s;entation. <HI>Farce</HI> is, in point of age, as well as rank, but a younger brother of the Theatre.</P>

<P>The di&s;tinction made by <HI>De Nores</HI> of <HI>the</HI> SATYRS not making a part of the Tragedy, but barely ap|pearing between the acts, can only &s;ignify, that the Tragick and Comick Scenes were kept apart from each other.

No &s;pecimen remaining of the Roman SATYRICK Piece, I may be permitted to il|lu&s;trate the rule of Horace by a brilliant example from the <HI>&s;erio-comick</HI> HISTORIES of the Sovereign of our Drama.

<Q>The Greek Drama, we know, had its origin from the loo&s;e, licentious raillery of the rout of Bacchus, indulging to them&s;elves the free&s;t &s;allies of taunt and invective, as would be&s;t &s;uit to law|le&s;s natures, in&s;pirited by fe&s;tal mirth, and made extravagant by wine. Hence aro&s;e, and with a character an&s;wering to this original, the <HI>Satiric Drama</HI>; the &s;pirit of which was afterwards, in good mea&s;ure, revived and continued in the Old Comedy, and it&s;elf pre&s;erved, though with con|&s;iderable alteration in the form, through all the &s;everal periods of the Greek &s;tage; even when Tra|gedy, which aro&s;e out of it, was brought to its la&s;t perfection.</Q>

<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing that Dacier, who, in a controver&s;ial note, in refutation of Hein&s;ius, has &s;o properly re|marked Horace's adherence to Ari&s;totle, &s;hould not have ob&s;erved that his hi&s;tory of the Drama opens and proceeds nearly in the &s;ame order. Ari&s;totle in|deed does not name The&s;pis, but we cannot but in|clude his improvements among the changes, to which the Critick refers, before Tragedy acquired a per|manent form under Ae&s;chylus. The&s;pis &s;eems not only to have embodied <HI>the</HI> CHORUS, but to have pro|vided a theatrical apparatus for an itinerant exhibition; to have furni&s;hed di&s;gui&s;es for his performers, and to have broken the continuity of <HI>the</HI> CHORUS by an <HI>Interlocutor</HI>; to whom Ae&s;chylus adding another per|&s;onage, thereby fir&s;t created DRAMATICK DIA|LOGUE; while at the &s;ame time by a <HI>further diminu|tion of the</HI> CHORUS, by improving the dre&s;&s;es of the actors, and drawing them from their travelling waggon to a fixt &s;tage, he created <HI>a regular theatre.</HI></P>

<P>The author of the Engli&s;h Commentary has a note on this pa&s;&s;age, replete with fine ta&s;te, and &s;ound critici&s;m.</P>
<Q><P>This judgment of the poet, recommending do|me&s;tick &s;ubjects, as fitte&s;t for the &s;tage, may be inforced from many obvious rea&s;ons. As, 1. that it renders the drama infinitely more <HI>affecting:</HI> and this on many accounts, 1. As a &s;ubject, taken from our own annals, mu&s;t of cour&s;e carry with it an air of greater probability, at lea&s;t to the ge|nerality of the people, than one borrowed from

As it of cour&s;e affords the be&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t opportunities of catch|ing our minds, by frequent references to our man|ners, prejudices, and cu&s;toms. And of how great importance this is, may be learned from hence, that, even in the exhibition of foreign charac|ters, dramatic writers have found them&s;elves obliged to &s;acrifice truth and probability to the humour of the people, and to dre&s;s up their per|&s;onages, contrary to their own better judgment, in &s;ome degree according to the mode and man|ners of their re&s;pective countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"L'etude &eacute;gale des po&euml;tes de diff&eacute;rens tems &agrave; plaire &agrave; leurs &s;pec|tateurs, a encore influ&eacute; dans la maniere de peindre les caracteres.

<PB N="116" REF="178">
will be more likely to draw the manners with life and &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="2">II. Next, which &s;hould ever be one great point in view, it renders the drama more generally u&s;e|ful in its moral de&s;tination. For, it being con|ver&s;ant about dome&s;tic acts, the great in&s;truction of the fable more &s;en&s;ibly affects us; and the cha|racters exhibited, from the part we take in their good or ill qualities, will more probably influence our conduct.</P>
<P N="3">III. La&s;tly, this judgment will de&s;erve the greater regard, as the conduct recommended was, in fact, the practice of our great models, the Greek writers; in who&s;e plays, it is ob&s;ervable, there is &s;carcely a &s;ingle &s;cene, which lies out of the confines of Greece.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;ons, the practice hath, in all times, been but little followed. The Romans, after &s;ome few attempts in this way (from whence the poet took the occa&s;ion of de|livering it as a dramatic precept), &s;oon relap&s;ed into their old u&s;e; as appears from Seneca's, and the titles of other plays, written in, or after the Augu&s;tan age. Succeeding times continued the
<PB N="117" REF="179">
&s;ame attachment to Grecian, with the addition of an equal fondne&s;s for Roman, &s;ubjects. The rea|&s;on in both in&s;tances hath been ever the &s;ame: that &s;trong and early prejudice, approaching &s;ome|what to adoration, in favour of the illu&s;trious names of tho&s;e two great &s;tates. The account of this matter is very ea&s;y; for their writings, as they furni&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s of our younger, and the amu&s;ement of our riper, years; and more e&s;pecially make the &s;tudy of all tho&s;e, who devote them&s;elves to poetry and the &s;tage, in&s;en&s;ibly infix in us an exce&s;&s;ive veneration for all affairs in which they were concerned; in&s;omuch, that no other &s;ubjects or events &s;eem con&s;iderable enough, or ri&s;e, in any proportion, to our ideas of the dignity of the tragick &s;cene, but &s;uch as time and long admiration have con&s;ecrated in the annals of their &s;tory. Our Shake&s;peare was, I think, the fir&s;t that broke through this bondage of cla&s;&s;ical &s;uper|&s;tition. And he owed this felicity, as he did &s;ome others, to his want of what is called the advantage of a learned education. Thus uninfluenced by the weight of early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;truck at once into the road of nature and common &s;en&s;e: and with|out de&s;igning, without knowing it, hath left us in his hi&s;torical plays, with all their anomalies,
<PB N="118" REF="180">
an exacter re&s;emblance of the Athenian &s;tage, than is any where to be found in its mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ed ad|mirers and copyi&s;ts.</P>
<P>I will only add, that, for the more &s;ucce&s;sful execution of this rule of celebrating dome&s;tic acts, much will depend on the aera, from whence the &s;ubject is taken. Times too remote have almo&s;t the &s;ame inconveniences, and none of the advan|tages, which attend the ages of Greece and Rome. And for tho&s;e of later date, they are too much fa|miliarized to us, and have not as yet acquired that venerable ca&s;t and air, which tragedy demands, and age only can give. There is no fixing this point with preci&s;ion. In the general, that aera is the fitte&s;t for the poet's purpo&s;e, which, though fre&s;h enough in our minds to warm and intere&s;t us in the event of the action, is yet at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent times, as to have lo&s;t all tho&s;e mean and di&s;paraging circum&s;tances, which unavoidably adhere to recent deeds, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ink the noble&s;t modern tran&s;|actions to the level of ordinary life.</P><BIBL><HI>Notes on the Art of Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q>

<Q><P>Nothing in the art requires more attention and judgment, or more of that power of di&s;crimina|tion, which may not improperly be called Genius, than the &s;teering between general ideas and indi|viduality; for though the body of the whole mu&s;t certainly be compo&s;ed by the fir&s;t, in order to communicate a character of grandeur to the whole, yet a da&s;h of the latter is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to give an intere&s;t. An individual model, copied with &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, makes a mean &s;tyle like the Dutch; and the neglect of an actual model, and the method of proceeding &s;olely from idea, has
<PB N="123" REF="185">
a tendency to make the Painter degenerate into a manneri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the mind in repair, to replace and refre&s;hen tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions of nature, which are continually wearing away.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance mentioned in the life of Guido, is well worth the attention of Arti&s;ts: He was a&s;ked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty, which is acknowledged &s;uperior to that of every other Painter; he &s;aid he would &s;hew all the models he u&s;ed, and ordered a common Porter to &s;it before him, from whom he drew a beautiful countenance; this was intended by Guido as an exaggeration of his conduct; but his intention was to &s;hew that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have <HI>&s;ome model</HI> of nature before you, however you deviate from it, and correct it from the idea which you have formed in your mind of <HI>perfect beauty.</HI></P>
<P>In Painting it is far better to have a <HI>model</HI> even to <HI>depart</HI> from, than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea: There is &s;omething then to proceed on, &s;omething to be corrected; &s;o that even &s;uppo&s;ing that no part is taken, the model has &s;till been not without u&s;e.</P>

<P>We are now arrived at that portion of the Epi&s;tle, which I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that any Com|mentator ever pa&s;t, without ob&s;erving the peculiar language and conduct of the Poet. There is a kind of awful affection in his manner, wonderfully cal|culated to move our feelings and excite our atten|tion. The DIDACTICK and the EPISTOLARY &s;tile were never more happily blended. The Poet a&s;&s;umes the air of a father advi&s;ing his &s;on, rather than of a teacher in&s;tructing his pupils. Many Criticks have thrown out a cur&s;ory ob&s;ervation or two, as it were extorted from them by the pointed expre&s;&s;ions of the Poet: but none of them, that I have con&s;ulted, have attempted to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on, why Horace, having clo&s;ed his particular precepts, addre&s;&s;es all the re|mainder of his Epi&s;tle, on the nature and expediency of Poetical pur&s;uits, to <HI>the</HI> ELDER PISO only. I have endeavoured to give the mo&s;t natural rea&s;on for this conduct; a rea&s;on which, if I am not deceived, renders the whole of the Epi&s;tle intere&s;ting, as well as clear and con&s;i&s;tent; a rea&s;on which I am the more inclined to think &s;ub&s;tantial, as it confirms in great mea&s;ure the &s;y&s;tem of the Author of the Engli&s;h

<PB N="142" REF="204">
<P>I have endeavoured, after the example of the learned and ingenious author of the Engli&s;h Commentary, though on &s;omewhat different principles, to prove <Q REND="inline">"an unity of de&s;ign in this Epi&s;tle,"</Q> as well as to illu&s;trate <Q REND="inline">"the pertinent connection of its &s;everal parts."</Q> Many perhaps, like my&s;elf, will he&s;itate to embrace the &s;y&s;tem of that acute Critick; and as many, or more, may reject my hypothe&s;is. But I am thoroughly per&s;uaded that no per&s;on, who has con&s;idered this work of Horace with due attention, and carefully examined the drift and intention of the writer, but will at lea&s;t be convinced of the folly or blindne&s;s, or ha&s;te and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e Criticks, however di&s;tingui&s;hed, who have pro|nounced it to be a crude, unconnected, immethodi|cal, and inartificial compo&s;ition. No modern, I believe, ever more intently &s;tudied, or more clearly under&s;tood the works of Horace, than BOILEAU. His Art of Poetry is de&s;ervedly admired. But I am &s;urpri&s;ed that it has never been ob&s;erved that the Plan of that work is formed on the model of this Epi&s;tle, though &s;ome of the parts are more in detail, and others varied, according to the age and country of the writer. The fir&s;t Canto, like the fir&s;t Section of <HI>the Epi&s;tle to the Pi&s;os,</HI> is taken up in general pre|cepts. The &s;econd enlarges on the Lyrick, and
<PB N="143" REF="205">
Elegiack, and &s;maller &s;pecies of Poetry, but cur|&s;orily mentioned, or referred to, by Horace; but introduced by him into that part of the Epi&s;tle, that runs exactly parallel with the &s;econd Canto of Boi|leau's Art of Poetry. The third Canto treats, en|tirely on the ground of Horace, of Epick and Dra|matick Poetry; though the French writer has, with great addre&s;s, accommodated to his purpo&s;e what Horace has &s;aid but collaterally, and as it were in|cidentally, of the Epick. The la&s;t Canto is formed on the final &s;ection, the la&s;t hundred and eleven lines, of <HI>the Epi&s;tle to the Pi&s;os:</HI> the author however, judiciou&s;ly omitting in a profe&s;&s;ed Art of Poetry, the de&s;cription of the Frantick Bard, and concluding his work, like the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, with a com|pliment to the Sovereign.</P>
<P>This imitation I have not pointed out, in order to depreciate the excellent work of Boileau; but to &s;hew that, in the judgment of &s;o great a writer, the method of Horace was not &s;o ill conceived, as Scaliger pretends, even for the outline of an Art of Poetry: Boileau him&s;elf, at the very conclu&s;ion of his la&s;t Canto, &s;eems to avow and glory in the charge of having founded his work on that of HORACE.</P>

<P>After endeavouring to vouch &s;o &s;trong a te&s;timony, in favour of Horace's <HI>unity</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> from France, it is but candid to acknowledge that two of the mo&s;t popular Poets, of our own country, were of a con|trary opinion. Dryden, in his dedication of his tran&s;lation of the Aeneid to Lord Mulgrave, author of the E&s;&s;ay on Poetry, writes thus. <Q REND="inline">"In this ad|dre&s;s to your Lord&s;hip, I de&s;ign not a treati&s;e of Heroick Poetry, but write <HI>in a loo&s;e Epi&s;tolary way,</HI> &s;omewhat tending to that &s;ubject, <HI>after the ex|ample of Horace,</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of the 2d Book to Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, <HI>and of that</HI> TO THE PISOS; which we call his ART OF POETRY.

<P>Many pa&s;&s;ages of this Dedication, as well as other pieces of Dryden's pro&s;e, have been ver&s;ified by Pope. His opinion al&s;o, on the Epi&s;tle to the Pi&s;os, is &s;aid to have agreed with that of Dryden; though the Introduction to his Imitation of the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus forbids us to &s;uppo&s;e he entertained the like &s;entiments of that work with his great prede|ce&s;&s;or. His general idea of Horace &s;tands recorded in a mo&s;t admirable didactick poem; in the cour&s;e of which he &s;eems to have kept a &s;teady eye on this work of our author.</P>

I was almo&s;t confounded in the &s;erio|comick &s;cenes of the Satyrick Piece: In the mu&s;ical department I was ready, with Le Fevre, to execrate the Flute, and all the Commentators on it; and when I found my&s;elf reduced to &s;can the merits and demerits of Spondees and Trimeters, I almo&s;t fancied my&s;elf under the dominion of &s;ome <HI>plago&s;us Orbilius,</HI> and tran&s;lating the <HI>pro&s;odia</HI> of the Latin Grammar. Borrowers and Imitators cull the &s;weets, and &s;uck the cla&s;&s;ick flowers, rejecting at plea&s;ure all that ap|pear &s;our, bitter, or unpalatable.

<LG>
<L>IN Fletcher's days it was the favourite plan</L>
<L>Of Woman to dethrone the tyrant Man:</L>
<L>Our modern Fa&s;hions vary&mdash;yet their aim,</L>
<L>Howe'er pur&s;u'd appears the very &s;ame.</L>

<L>Quill'd up like Porcupines, they &s;hot their darts,</L>
<L>Slaughter'd whole rows of Knights, and wounded Hearts:</L>
<L>Their Virtue nought could &s;hake, no &s;iege could alter:</L>
<L>A rock, impregnable as Gibraltar!</L>
<L>In vain were &s;ighs, and tears, and idle flattery,</L>
<L>Their red-hot balls laid low each ho&s;tile battery,</L>
<L>While they, bright &s;tars, above all weak compari&s;on,</L>
<L>Shone forth the Female Eliotts of the Garri&s;on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The modern maiden finds things alter'd quite,</L>
<L>A hundred Danglers, not one faithful Knight!</L>
<L>Nor coy, nor cruel, all her charms di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>Coldly &s;he's &s;een, and tru&s;ting &s;he's betray'd:</L>

<L>Un&s;kill'd their anxious terrors to conceal,</L>

<L>Good Humour too the joyous &s;ea&s;on guides,</L>
<L>Quaffs at your tables, chats by your fire&s;ides.</L>
<L>The Bellman, carolling his clum&s;y rhyme,</L>
<L>You dub the Bard and Min&s;trel of the time.</L>

<L>SINCE the new po&s;t-hor&s;e tax, I dare engage</L>
<L>That &s;ome folks here have travell'd in the Stage:</L>
<L>Jamm'd in at midnight, in cold winter weather,</L>
<L>The crouded pa&s;&s;engers are glew'd together.</L>
<L>O'er many a rut, and ill-pav'd cau&s;eway jumbling,</L>
<L>They pa&s;s their Journey, ju&s;tling, jolting, grumbling.</L>
<L>Sometimes a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect &s;trikes the eye,</L>
<L>Sometimes they chuckle when a good inn's nigh;</L>
<L>'Till many a &s;quabble, &s;ome endearments pa&s;t,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>I Am a poor Strolling Player&mdash;and my haple&s;s condition</L>
<L>Obliges me to wait upon you with my Humble Petition.</L>
<L>Thro' England, South Wales, and North Wales,</L>
<L>I have travell'd many years &s;ince,</L>
<L>And repre&s;ented Lover and Hero, Wit and Fool,</L>
<L>State&s;man and Cuckold, Beggar and Prince;</L>
<L>Nay more than Ro&s;cius, Betterton, Booth, or Garrick him&s;elf could &s;ay,</L>
<L>I have acted every part&mdash;women as well as men&mdash;every part in every play.</L>
<L>Not long ago, at O&s;we&s;try, we did the falchion wield:</L>
<L>Now near this place we pitch our tent&mdash;very near here&mdash;even in Wrexham <HI>Field</HI>;</L>
<L>By Metaphor I &s;ay <HI>Field,</HI> for in fact, at a very great expence,</L>
<L>We have fitted up the Town Hall, and (for the fir&s;t time) made it the Theatre of Common Sen&s;e.</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="347">Our bills all hone&s;tly paid, now new dangers we e&s;&s;ay!</L>
<L>Rival Strollers have ari&s;en, and are re&s;olv'd to exhibit at Wynn&s;tay:</L>
<L>And what I am &s;ure in our cau&s;e will make you very hearty,</L>
<L>The little Manager from the Hay-market is one of the party.</L>
<L>They call them&s;elves <HI>Gentlemen</HI> indeed, but &s;till I &s;ay &s;o much the wor&s;e!</L>
<L>For when Gentlemen act unlike Gentlemen, 'tis a private and a publick cur&s;e.</L>
<L>Why &s;hould a Gentleman pretend to more than he under&s;tands,</L>
<L>Take the bread out of our mouths, and our trade out of our hands?</L>
<L>All arts are be&s;t executed by the arti&s;ts them&s;elves;</L>

<L>I'll drive you, my Dear! at the door &s;ee the hor&s;es and Phaeton &s;tand!</L>
<L>From high &s;teps to the Chai&s;e Sir John and the Lady mount three pair of &s;tairs,</L>

<L>They have given &s;ome rea&s;ons which I think will hold water&mdash;</L>
<L>They have had a Chri&s;tening it &s;eems, and Sir</L>
