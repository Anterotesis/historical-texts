<HEAD>THE ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WE read of a great Prince of Antiquity, who would &s;uffer his Portrait to be taken only by the greate&s;t Arti&s;t. And he thought ju&s;tly without que&s;tion: A great Object ought ever to be handled by a great Ma&s;ter. But yet I am apt to think that if <HI>Apelles</HI> had not offered his Service, the Monarch, rather than have had his Form unknown to Po&s;te|rity, would have been glad to have employed &s;ome meaner Hand.&mdash;If <HI>Stow</HI> had been as fortunate in this Particular as <HI>Alexander,</HI> I need not now have taken up my Pencil: But as this charming Land&s;kip is yet un|touched by a <HI>Titian,</HI> or a <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> a mere Bungler has been tempted to ven|ture upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">But in Excu&s;e for the Meanne&s;s of the Performance it may be &s;aid, that it is not de&s;igned to be con&s;idered as a fini&s;hed Piece: This View was not taken upon the Spot, as it ought to have been, but only from my Memory and a few loo&s;e Scratches; if the Public therefore will call it only a rough Draught, or at be&s;t a coloured Sketch, my Ambition will be fully &s;a|tisfied. The Curious therefore mu&s;t purcha&s;e it rather from their Nece&s;|&s;ity than its Merit; as they do meaner Engravings of the Cartoons, where <HI>Dorigny</HI>'s are not to be had: <Q>'Tis true, Gentlemen, &s;ays the Print|&s;eller, they are far from being good, but take my Word for it, you will meet with no better.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE UPON THE GARDENS <HI>of the Right Honourable the</HI> Lord Vi&s;count COBHAM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_POLYPTHON</HI> was a Gentle|man engaged in a way of Life, that excu&s;ed him two Months in the Year from Bu&s;ine&s;s; which Time he u&s;ed generally to &s;pend in vi&s;iting what was curious in the &s;everal Counties around him. As he had long promi&s;ed his Friend <HI>Callophilus</HI> to pa&s;s away his Va|cancy, at &s;ome time or other, in <HI>Bucking|ham&s;hire,</HI> he determined upon it this Year, and accordingly paid him a Vi&s;it at * * *. <HI>Stow</HI> was one of the fir&s;t Places where his Curio&s;ity carried him; and indeed he had
<PB N="2" REF="5">&s;carce got his Foot within the Garden-door, before he broke out into the fol|lowing Exclamation.</P>
<P>Why, here is a View that gives me a kind of Earne&s;t of what my Expectation is rai&s;ed to!</P>
<P>It is a very fine one indeed (replied <HI>Callophilus:</HI>) I do not wonder it &s;hould catch your Sight: The old Ruin upon the left of the Canal, the Opening to the Pyra|mid, the View towards the Hou&s;e, the River, the beautiful Di&s;po&s;ition of the Trees on the other &s;ide of it, and that venerable old Temple, make a fine Variety of Objects. But your Eye is &s;o taken up with Views at a di&s;tance, that you neglect &s;omething here at hand very well worth your notice. What do you think of the&s;e two Pavilions?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really they are light, gen|teel Buildings enough. I like the&s;e rough Paintings too; they are done in a very free, ma&s;terly Manner. Pray, Sir, do you know the Stories?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are both taken from <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido;</HI> the di&s;con&s;olate Nymph there, poor <HI>Dorinda,</HI> had long been in love with <HI>Syl|vio,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="6">a wild Hunter, of barbarous Manners, in who&s;e Brea&s;t &s;he had no rea&s;on to believe &s;he had rai&s;ed an an&s;wering Pa&s;&s;ion. As &s;he was roving in the Woods, &s;he acciden|tally met his Dog, and &s;aw her beloved Hunter him&s;elf at a di&s;tance hollowing, and running after it. She immediately calls the Hound to her, and hides it among&s;t the Bu&s;hes. <HI>Sylvio</HI> comes up to her, and en|quires very eagerly after his Dog: The poor Nymph puts him off, and tries all her Art to in&s;pire him with Love, but to no purpo&s;e; the cold Youth was quite in&s;en|&s;ible, and his Thoughts could admit no other Object but his Dog. Almo&s;t de&s;pair|ing, &s;he at length hopes to bribe his Af|fections, and lets him know &s;he has his Dog, which &s;he will return if he will pro|mi&s;e to love her, and give her a Ki&s;s; <HI>Sylvio</HI> is overjoyed at the Propo&s;al, and promi&s;es to give her ten thou&s;and Ki&s;&s;es. <HI>Dorinda</HI> upon this brings the Dog: but alas! &s;ee there the Succe&s;s of all her Pains: the Youth tran&s;ported at the Sight of his Dog, throws his Arms round its Neck and lavi&s;hes upon it tho&s;e Ki&s;&s;es and Endear|ments, in the very Sight of the poor af|flicted Lady, which &s;he had been flattering her&s;elf would have fallen to her &s;hare. &mdash; On this other Wall Di&s;dain and Love have taken different Sides; the Youth is warm,
<PB N="4" REF="7">and the Nymph is coy: Poor <HI>Myrtillo</HI> had long loved <HI>Amarillis;</HI> the Lady was en|gaged to another, and rejected his Pa&s;&s;ion. Gladly would he only have &s;poke his Grief, but the cruel fair One ab&s;olutely forbid him her Pre&s;ence. At length a Scheme was laid by <HI>Cori&s;ca,</HI> the young Lover's Confi|dant, which was to gain him Admi&s;&s;ion into his dear <HI>Amarillis</HI>'s Company. The Lady is enticed into the Fields with &s;ome of <HI>Cori&s;ca</HI>'s Companions, (who were let into the Plot) to play at Blindman's Buff, where <HI>Myrtillo</HI> was to &s;urprize her. See there he &s;tands he&s;itating what u&s;e to make of &s;o favourable an Opportunity, which Love has put into his Hands. &mdash; If you have &s;atisfied your Curio&s;ity here, let us walk towards the Temple of <HI>Venus.</HI> But hold: we had better fir&s;t go down towards that Wilderne&s;s, and take a View of the Lake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word here is a noble Piece of Water!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not many Years ago I remem|ber it only a Mar&s;h: it &s;urprized me pro|digiou&s;ly when I fir&s;t &s;aw it floated in this manner with a Lake. Ob&s;erve, pray, what a fine Effect that old Ruin has at the Head of it: Its Ornaments too, the Ca&s;cade,
<PB N="5" REF="8">the Trees and Shrubs, half concealing, and half di&s;covering the ragged View, and the Obelisk ri&s;ing beyond it, are Objects hap|pily di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I think the Ruin a great Addition to the Beauty of the Lake. There is &s;omething &s;o va&s;tly pictu|re&s;que, and plea&s;ing to the imagination in &s;uch Objects, that they are a great Addi|tion to every Landskip. And yet perhaps it would be hard to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on, why we are more taken with Pro&s;pects of this ruinous kind, than with Views of Plenty and Pro|&s;perity in their greate&s;t Perfection: Bene|volence and Good-nature, methinks, are more concerning in the latter kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but cannot you make a di&s;tinction between natural and moral Beau|ties? Our &s;ocial Affections undoubtedly find their Enjoyment the mo&s;t compleat when they contemplate, a Country &s;mil|ing in the mid&s;t of Plenty, where Hou&s;es are well-built, Plantations regular, and every thing the mo&s;t commodious and u&s;e|ful. But &s;uch Regularity and Exactne&s;s excites no manner of Plea&s;ure in the Ima|gination, unle&s;s they are made u&s;e of to contra&s;t with &s;omething of an oppo&s;ite kind. The Fancy is &s;truck by <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">alone; and if <HI>Art</HI> does any thing more than improve her, we think &s;he grows im|pertinent, and wi&s;h &s;he had left off a little &s;ooner. Thus a regular Building perhaps gives us very little plea&s;ure; and yet a fine Rock, beautifully &s;et off in Claro-ob&s;curo, and garni&s;hed with flouri&s;hing Bu&s;hes, Ivy, and dead Branches, may afford us a great deal; and a ragged Ruin, with venerable old Oaks, and Pines nodding over it, may perhaps plea&s;e the Fancy yet more than either of the other two Objects.&mdash;You old Hermitage, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of this de|lightful Wilderne&s;s, has an exceeding good Effect: it is of the romantick Kind; and Beauties of this &s;ort, where a probable Na|ture is not exceeded, are generally plea&s;ing. &mdash;This Opening will lead us again into the Terrace.&mdash;That large Bulding, the In|&s;cription lets you &s;ee, is a Temple dedicated to <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word a Ma&s;ter has been at work here! I cannot &s;ay I have met with any modern Touching, this long time, that has plea&s;ed me better. I &s;ee very little to be cavilled at, with regard either to the De&s;ign, Colouring, or Drawing. The&s;e Stories are taken from the <HI>Fairy-Queen</HI> I dare &s;ay; they look like <HI>Spencer</HI>'s Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: that Lady is the fair <HI>Hel|linore,</HI> who having left a di&s;agreeable Hu&s;|band, and wandering in the Woods, was met by the polite Sett of Gentry &s;he is dancing with: She likes their Manner of Life, and re&s;olves to enjoy it with them. Her old Spou&s;e <HI>Malbecco</HI> is incon&s;olable for his Lo&s;s: he wanders many Days in &s;earch of her, and at length finds her (you &s;ee him at a di&s;tance peeping from behind a Tree) revelling with a bea&s;tly Herd of Satyrs. When the Evening comes on, he follows the Company to their Retirement, takes a commodious &s;tand, and to his great Torment &s;ees every thing that pa&s;&s;es among them. After they were all laid a&s;leep, he creeps gently to his Lady, and you &s;ee him in the other Painting offering to be recon|ciled to her again, if &s;he will return back with him. But <HI>Hellinore</HI> threatens to awake the Satyrs, and get him &s;everely hand|led if he does not immediately leave her. Upon which the poor Cuckold is obliged to fly, and &s;oon after runs di&s;tracted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>This loo&s;e Story, the&s;e luxu|rious Couches, and the Embelli&s;hments round the Walls, give the Place quite a <HI>Cy|prian</HI> Air, and make it a very proper Retreat for its incontinent Inhabitant upon the
<PB N="8" REF="11">Roof.&mdash; But let us move forward towards yon cubico pyramidical Building It looks like a mighty &s;ub&s;tantial one: I fancy it is Sir <HI>John</HI>'s; he is generally pretty liberal of his Stone. However, it terminates this Terrace extremely well: the A&s;cent up to it too has a good Effect.&mdash;Pray, do you know what that Field there, upon the right, is to be improved into?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urprized the Beauty of it, in its pre&s;ent Form, does not &s;trike you at fir&s;t &s;ight. It is de&s;igned, like a Gla&s;s of Bitters before Dinner, to quicken your Ap|petite for the elegant Entertainment that is to follow. For my part, I a&s;&s;ure you, I find it a very great Relief to my Eye, to take it from the&s;e grand Objects, and ca&s;t it for a few Minutes upon &s;uch a rural Scene as this. Do not you think that Haycock contra&s;ts extremely well with this Temple? Such Oppo&s;itions, in my Opinion, are highly plea&s;ing.&mdash;That Building there is called, <HI>The Belvidere.</HI> Whatever you may think of it, from this Stand, it has its U&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, in &s;everal Pro&s;pects in the Gardens.&mdash;There is a very good Copy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Boxers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like its Situation extreamly: it terminates the&s;e Alleys, and that Opening
<PB N="9" REF="12">from the Terrace, very beautifully; much better, I think, than the fighting Gladia|tor, and <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> killing the <HI>Phili&s;tine,</HI> do that other va&s;t Terrace; the Objects there, in my Opinion, are too &s;mall for the Di&s;tance: Here both are ju&s;tly propor|tioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Critici&s;m, I think, is ra|ther too refined: I cannot &s;ee what occa&s;ion there is always for a confined View; a more open one &s;ometimes makes Variety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take me: I am not again&s;t a Pro&s;pect's being bounded even by the blue Hills in the Country. All I mean is this, that where Objects are &s;et up to ter|minate a View, they ought to be of &s;uch a Nature as to afford Plea&s;ure at any Di&s;tance they are de&s;igned to be viewed from. The&s;e Statues I have been mentioning, are Ob|jects &s;o &s;mall, that at one end of the Ter|race it is impo&s;&s;ible to make out what is offered you at the other.&mdash;I have too much Envy in my Temper, you mu&s;t know, to bear to &s;ee any thing perfect; and I came in here fully determined to cavil, if I &s;aw the lea&s;t Grounds. But this is a &s;ad Place, I find, for a malicious Spirit to enter: He who&s;e chief <HI>Entertainment</HI> is finding fault, will here meet with a very &s;lender <HI>Repa&s;t:</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13">As the Devil did at Sight of the Creation, in &s;pite of Envy he mu&s;t cry out,
<Q><L>Terre&s;trial Heaven!&mdash;</L>
<L>With what Delight could I have walk'd thee round,</L>
<L>If I could joy in ought: Sweet Inter|change</L>
<L>Of Hill, and Valley, Rivers, Woods, and Plains!</L>
<L>Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Fore&s;t crown'd,</L>
<L>Rocks, Dens, and Caves.&mdash;</L></Q>
But what have we got here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Building we took notice of from the Temple of <HI>Venus.</HI> I know you are no Friend to a cloathed Statue; &s;o I que&s;tion whether you will meet with any thing here to your Ta&s;te.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is &s;omething extremely grand and noble, I have always thought, in &s;everal of the old cloathed Statues, and par|ticularly in &s;ome of the <HI>Roman</HI> con&s;ular ones; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am always better plea&s;ed when I find them without their Finery. Marble, tho' admirably fitted to expre&s;s the Roundne&s;s of a Mu&s;cle, very often fails when it attempts to give you the
<PB N="11" REF="14">Folds of Drapery. The Ancients, it mu&s;t be owned, even in their Draperies are often &s;ucce&s;sful; but among&s;t our modern At|tempts in this Way, how many horrid Pieces of Rock-work have I beheld!</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;atram</L>
<L>De&s;inet in <HI>rupem</HI> mulier&mdash;</L></Q>
<P><HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> whenever he found him|&s;elf obliged to cloath his Statues, u&s;ed to do it with wet Linnen; which is unque&s;tion|ably the mo&s;t advantageous kind of Cloath|ing for a Statue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you are not to be plea&s;ed here, let us pa&s;s on to &s;omething el&s;e. There is no Occa&s;ion to turn down to that Pyra|mid; it is an Object not de&s;igned to be viewed at a Yard's Di&s;tance; but you will &s;ee its U&s;e by and by, in a Variety of beau|tiful Views: Let us pur&s;ue our Walk along this Terrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why here we entirely lo&s;e &s;ight of the Garden; our elegant Pro&s;pects are all vani&s;hed: I cannot conceive what this impertinent Hedge does here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you never experience in a Concert va&s;t Plea&s;ure when the whole Band
<PB N="12" REF="15">for a few Moments made a full Pau&s;e? The Ca&s;e is parallel: You have already had a great many fine Views, and that you may not be cloyed, this Hedge &s;teps in to keep your Attention awake. One Extreme recommends ano|ther: The Morali&s;ts ob&s;erve, that a lit|tle Adver&s;ity quickens our Reli&s;h for the Enjoyment of Life; and it is the Man of Ta&s;te's Care not to di&s;tribute his Beauties with too profu&s;e a Hand, for a Rea&s;on of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<Q><L>Let not each Beauty every where be &s;py'd,</L>
<L>Where half the Skill is decently to hide.</L></Q>
<P>But if you mu&s;t have &s;omething to look at, the Park there upon your left Hand affords you &s;ome very fine Views. I like that Eque&s;|trian Statue extremely: It is, in my Opinion, a very beautiful Circum&s;tance. What a Number of fine Vi&s;tas it terminates thro' the Trees, varying its Appearance in each of them.&mdash;There you have a charming View &s;truck out towards the Temple of Ancient Virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks that Statue of the Faun &s;tands a little aukwardly: He might at lea&s;t, I &s;hould think, have fixed him&s;elf in the Middle of the Semi-circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not certainly attend to his U&s;e: He &s;tands there to receive the Eye placed at the other End of that Opening.&mdash; That elegant little Building I think they call <HI>Nel&s;on</HI>'s Scat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Painting is done ma&s;terly enough: The In&s;criptions, I &s;ee, explain the De&s;igns. Tho&s;e Boys fixing the Trophies are prettily imagined. From hence that round Building terminates the View ex|tremely well. Let us walk to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold&mdash;turn to the Right a lit|tle: We mu&s;t fir&s;t pay a Vi&s;it here to the Temple of <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have had a pretty long Walk, &s;uppo&s;e we &s;it down here a Mo|ment: The&s;e Walls &s;eem to promi&s;e us &s;ome Entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Sir, you &s;ee repre&s;ented the Triumphs and Happine&s;s of Drunken|ne&s;s. Tho&s;e mu&s;ical Ladies too are not improper Companions to this mirthfully-di&s;po&s;ed Deity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of tho&s;e &s;maller Figures are really done extremely well: And tho&s;e two Va&s;es are delightfully touched. I can|not
<PB N="14" REF="17">&s;ay I am &s;o much plea&s;ed with the jolly Inhabitant: Even <HI>Bacchus</HI> him&s;elf certainly never made &s;o enormous a Figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am admiring the fine View from hence: So great a Variety of beautiful Objects, and all &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed, make a mo&s;t delightful Picture. Don't you think this Building too is a very genteel one, and is extremely well &s;ituated? The&s;e Trees give it an agreeable, cool Air, and make it, I think, as elegant a Retreat for the Enjoy|ment of a Summer's Evening, as can well be imagined.&mdash;But it is mere trifling to &s;it here: Let us walk towards the Rotunda.&mdash; This little Alley will carry us to <HI>Dido</HI>'s Cave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dido</HI>'s Cave! why 'tis built of hewn Stone! Here &s;he is however, and her <HI>pious</HI> Companion along with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e two Cupids joining their Torches, I never &s;ee but I admire extremely: they are very finely painted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think they are indeed. But let us be a little complai&s;ant, and not in|terrupt the&s;e kind Lovers too long. I want to &s;ee this Rotunda.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>There then you have it: I hope you cannot complain of an heavy Building here. I do not know any Piece of Stone|work in the whole Garden that &s;hews it&s;elf to more Advantage than this does, or makes a more beautiful Figure in a Variety of fine Views from &s;everal Parts of the Garden: Several Parts of the Garden likewi&s;e return the Compliment, by offering a great many very elegant Pro&s;pects to it. There you have an Opening laid out with all the De|corations of Art; a &s;pacious Theatre; the Area floated by a Canal, and peopled with Swans and Wild-ducks: Her late Maje&s;ty is the principal Figure in the Scene, and around her a merry Company of Nymphs and Swains enjoying them&s;elves in the Shade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot very much admire&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come; none of your Cavils,&mdash; Ob&s;erve how this View is beautifully con|tra&s;ted by one on the oppo&s;ite Side of a dif|ferent kind; in which we are almo&s;t &s;olely obliged to Nature. You mu&s;t know I look upon this as a very noble Pro&s;pect! The Field is formed by that Semi-circle of Trees into a very grand Theatre. The Point of Sight is centred in a beautiful manner by the Pyramid, which appears to great Advantage
<PB N="16" REF="19">among&s;t tho&s;e venerable Oaks: Two or three other Buildings, half hid among&s;t the Trees, come in for their Share in the Pro|&s;pect, and add much to the Beauty of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you entirely; nor do I think this other View inferior to it. That Variety of different Shades among&s;t the Trees; the Lake &s;pread &s;o elegantly among&s;t them, and glittering here and there thro' the Bu&s;hes, with the Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> as a Termination to the View, make up a very beautiful Landskip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is a Vi&s;ta likewi&s;e very happily terminated by the Canal, and the Obelisk ri&s;ing in the Mid&s;t of it. There is another clo&s;e View likewi&s;e towards <HI>Nel|son</HI>'s Seat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, we have a Variety of very elegant Pro&s;pects centred in this Point. I could &s;it here very agreeably a little longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, if you are inclined to re&s;t, come along with me: I'll carry you to where you may indulge your Humour with great Propriety. Deep in the Retirement of that Wood, the God of Sleep has reared his Habitation, where he will afford you every
<PB N="17" REF="20">Convenience to make a Nap agreeable &mdash; It comes into my Head that I forgot to carry you to a little Place, which it is hardly worth while to travel back to from this Di&s;tance: It is called <HI>St. Au&s;tin</HI>'s Cave, and an&s;wers its Title very well; it appears quite Cell-like, &s;tands retired, and is made of no other Materials but Roots and Mo&s;s. In the In&s;ide a Straw Couch offers you an hard Seat, and the Walls three humorous In&s;criptions, in Monki&s;h Ver&s;e. You may buy them, bound up with Copies of all the other In&s;criptions, in a Six-penny Pamphlet, that will be offered us at the Inn.&mdash; There, Sir, is the Temple of Sleep.</P>

<P>Why really I mu&s;t confe&s;s <HI>Ovid</HI> him&s;elf could &s;carce have buried the &s;en&s;ele&s;s God in an happier Retirement. This gloomy Darkne&s;s, the&s;e ea&s;y Couches, and that excellent <HI>Epicurean</HI> Argument above the Door, would incline me wonderfully to indulge a little, if the&s;e beautiful Ornaments did not keep my Attention awake. There is wanting too a purling Stream, to &s;ing a Requiem to the Sen&s;es; tho' the Want is in &s;ome mea&s;ure made up by the drow&s;y Lullibies of that murmuring Swarm, which this Shade has invited to wanton beneath it. You would laugh at me, or I &s;hould certainly throw my&s;elf down upon one of
<PB N="18" REF="21">the&s;e Couches; I am per&s;uaded I &s;hould need no Opium to clo&s;e my Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own &s;leeping is a Compliment as much due to this Place, as Admiration and Attention are to <HI>Raphael</HI> at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI> But try if your Curio&s;ity cannot keep you awake. Come, leave the&s;e drow&s;y Abodes, they are infectious; like lu&s;cious Food they will blunt your Appetite before the Entertainment is half over. Walk down that Alley, and pop your Head into the fir&s;t Door you come to.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the D&mdash;l have we got here? What wretched Scrawler has been at work upon the&s;e Walls?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I look upon this as a very great Ma&s;ter-piece. You mu&s;t know this Hou&s;e is inhabited by a Necro|mancer; and that In&s;cription lets you &s;ee the Hand that has been employed to paint it. The Compo&s;ition, Drawing, and Pencilling, I can allow you, are not the mo&s;t elegant; yet if the De&s;ign and Figures are the Arti&s;t's own, I can a&s;&s;ure you he has &s;hewn excel|lent Humour, and an exceeding good In|vention. That Con&s;ultation is well ima|gined; and &s;o are the&s;e Witches and Wizards, their Employments likewi&s;e, their Form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="19" REF="22">and Attitudes are well varied.&mdash;But I &s;ee this is a Scene not &s;uited to your Ta&s;te: Our next, I hope, will plea&s;e you better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what Building is that be|fore us? I cannot &s;ay I di&s;like the Ta&s;te it is de&s;igned in. It &s;eems an Antique.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Temple, Sir, of An|cient Virtue; the Place I am now conduct|ing you to. You will meet within it a very illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly of great Men; the wi&s;e&s;t Lawgiver, the be&s;t Philo&s;opher, the mo&s;t divine Poet, and the mo&s;t able Captain, that perhaps ever lived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly, Sir, engage your&s;elf in a Di&s;pute, by fixing your Epithers in &s;uch an ab&s;olute manner; there are &s;o many Competitors in each of the&s;e Ways, that altho' Numbers may be called truly eminent, it will be a difficult matter to fix Pre-eminence upon any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will hardly, I fancy, di&s;&s;ent from me, when I introduce you to the&s;e great Heroes of Antiquity: There &s;tands <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> there <HI>Socrates;</HI> there <HI>Homer;</HI> and there <HI>Epaminondas.</HI> Illu&s;trious Chiefs, who made Virtue their only Pur&s;uit, and the Welfare of Mankind their only Study;
<PB N="20" REF="23">in who&s;e Brea&s;ts mean Self-intere&s;t had no Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. To e&s;tabli&s;h a well-regulated Con&s;titution; to dictate the &s;ounde&s;t Mo|rality, to place Virtue in the mo&s;t amiable Light; and bravely to defend a People's Liberty, were Ends which neither the Dif|ficulty in overcoming the Prejudices, and taming the &s;avage Manners of a barbarous State; the Corruptions of a licentious Age, and the Ill-u&s;age of an invidious City; nei|ther the va&s;t Pains of &s;earching into Nature, and laying up a Stock of Knowledge &s;uf|ficient to produce the noble&s;t Work of Art; nor popular Tumults at Home, and the mo&s;t threatning Dangers Abroad, could ever tempt them to lo&s;e Sight of, or in the lea&s;t abate that Ardency of Temper with which they pur&s;ued them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>A noble Panegyric upon my Word! why, Sir, the&s;e great Spirits have in&s;pired you with the very Soul of Oratory. However, in earne&s;t, I confe&s;s your Enco|mium is pretty ju&s;t; and I am apt to be|lieve that if any of tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen &s;hould take it into his Head to walk from his Nitch, it would puzzle the World to find his Equal to fix in his Room.&mdash; That old Ruin, I &s;uppo&s;e, is intended to contra&s;t with this new Building.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="24">
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it is intended to con|tra&s;t with it not only in the Landskip, but likewi&s;e in its Name and De&s;ign. Walk a little nearer, and you will &s;ee its Inten|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can &s;ee nothing here to let me into its De&s;ign, except this old Gentle|man; neither can I find any thing extraor|dinary in him, except that he has met with a Fate that he is entirely de&s;erving of, which is more than falls to the Share of every worthle&s;s Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ob&s;erved how the Sta|tue is decorated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I &s;ee the whole De&s;ign: A very elegant Piece of Satyr, upon my Word! This pompous Edifice is intended, I &s;uppo&s;e, to repre&s;ent the flouri&s;hing Condition, in which ancient Virtue &s;till exi&s;ts; and tho&s;e poor &s;hattered Remains of what has never been very beautiful (notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ee, they are placed within a few Yards of a Pari&s;h-church) are de&s;igned to let us &s;ee the ruinous State of decayed modern Virtue. And the Moral is, that Glory founded up|on true Worth and Honour, will exi&s;t, when Fame, built upon Conque&s;t and popular Ap|plau&s;e, will fade away. This is really the
<PB N="22" REF="25">be&s;t thing I have &s;een: I am mo&s;t prodigiou&s;|ly taken with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intend next to carry you to a Scene of another kind. I am going to &s;hew you the Grotto, a Place generally very tak|ing with Strangers.&mdash;I thought that Piece of Satyr would catch your Attention: I hope likewi&s;e you will be as well plea&s;ed here. This Gate will carry us into the ro|mantic Retirement. What do you think of this Scene?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir, it is quite a Novelty: This Profu&s;ion of Mirrors has a very extraordinary Effect: The Place &s;eems divided into a thou&s;and beautiful Apart|ments, and appears fifty times as large as it is. The Pro&s;pects without are likewi&s;e transferred to the Walls within: And the Sides of the Room are elegantly adorned with Landskips, beyond the Pencil of <HI>Titian;</HI> with this farther Advantage, that every View, as you change your Situation, varies it&s;elf into another Form, and pre&s;ents you with &s;omething new.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think that &s;erpentine River, as it is called, is a great Addition to the Beauty of the Place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="26">
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly it is. Water is of as much U&s;e in a Landskip, as Blood is in a Body; without the&s;e two E&s;&s;entials, it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be life in either one or the other. Yet methinks it is a prodigious Pity that this &s;tagnate Pool &s;hould not by &s;ome Magic be metamorpho&s;ed in|to a cry&s;tal Stream, rolling over a Bed of Pebbles. Such a quick Circulation would give an infinite Spirit to the View. I could wi&s;h his Lord&s;hip had &s;uch a &s;tream at his Command; he would &s;hew it, I dare &s;ay, to the be&s;t Advantage, in its Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Gardens. But we cannot <HI>make</HI> Nature, the utmo&s;t we can do is to <HI>mend</HI> her. &mdash; I have heard a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman &s;peak of the River, upon which the Town of <HI>Sterling</HI> &s;tands, which is as remarkable a Meander as I have ever heard of. From <HI>Sterling</HI> to a little Village upon the Banks of this River, by Land it is only four Miles, and yet if you &s;hould follow the Cour&s;e of the Water, you will find it above twenty.&mdash; There is an Hou&s;e likewi&s;e that &s;tands upon a narrow I&s;thmus of a Penin&s;ula, formed by this &s;ame River, which is mighty remarkable: The Water runs clo&s;e to both Ends of it, and yet if you &s;ail from one to the other, you will be carried a Compa&s;s of four Miles.&mdash;Such a River winding about this Place, would make it a Paradi&s;e indeed!</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">As we are got into the North, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know any Part of the King|dom that abounds more with elegant na|tural Views: Our well-cultivated Plains, as you ob&s;erved before, are certainly not com|parable to their rough Nature in point of Pro&s;pect. About three Years ago I rode the Northern Circuit: The Weather was extremely fine; and I &s;carce remember be|ing more agreeably entertained than I was with the &s;everal charming Views exhibited to me in the northern Counties. Curio&s;ity indeed, rather than Bu&s;ine&s;s, carried me down: And as I had my Time pretty much to my&s;elf, I &s;pent it in a great mea&s;ure in hunting after beautiful Objects. Sometimes I found my&s;elf hemmed within an Amphi|theatre of Mountains, which were variou&s;ly ornamented, &s;ome with &s;cattered Trees, &s;ome with tufted Wood, &s;ome with graz|ing Cattle, and &s;ome with &s;moaking Cot|tages. Here and there an elegant View likewi&s;e was opened into the Country.&mdash; A Mile's riding, perhaps, would have car|ried me to the Foot of a &s;teep Precipice, down which thundered the whole Weight of &s;ome va&s;t River, which was da&s;hed into Foam at the Bottom, by the craggy Points of &s;everal ri&s;ing Rocks: A deep Gloom over|&s;pread the Pro&s;pect, occa&s;ioned by the clo&s;e Wood that hung round it on every Side.&mdash;
<PB N="25" REF="28">I could de&s;cribe to you a Variety of other Views I met with there, if we <HI>here</HI> wanted Entertainment in the Way of Landskip. One, however, I cannot forbear mention|ing, and wi&s;hing at the &s;ame time that his Lord&s;hip had &s;uch Materials to work with, and it could not be but he would make a mo&s;t noble Picture.&mdash;The Place I have in view is upon the Banks of the Ri|ver <HI>Eden</HI> (which is indeed one of the fine&s;t Rivers I ever &s;aw). I &s;carce know a fitter Place for a Genius in this Way to exert it|&s;elf in. There is the greate&s;t Variety of garni&s;hed Rocks, &s;hattered Precipices, ri&s;|ing Hills, ornamented with the fine&s;t Woods, thro' which are opened the mo&s;t elegant Vales that I have ever met with: Not to mention the mo&s;t enchanting Views up and down the River, which winds it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to &s;hew its Banks to the be&s;t Advantage, which, together with very charm|ing Pro&s;pects into the Country, terminated by the blue Hills at a Di&s;tance, make as fine a Piece of Nature, as perhaps can any where be met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire your Ta&s;te in Landskip extremely; you have marked out ju&s;t &s;uch Circum&s;tances as would take me mo&s;t in a View. I am I find almo&s;t as enthu&s;ia&s;tic a Lover of Nature as you are. Yet tho' I can
<PB N="26" REF="29">allow her to have an excellent <HI>Fancy,</HI> I do not think &s;he has the be&s;t <HI>Judgment.</HI> Tho' Nature is an admirable <HI>Colouri&s;t,</HI> her <HI>Com|po&s;ition</HI> is very often liable to Cen&s;ure. For which Rea&s;on I am for having her placed un|der the Direction of <HI>Art:</HI> And the Rule I would go by &s;hould be Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s;
<Q><L>&mdash;Treat the Godde&s;s like a mode&s;t Fair,</L>
<L>Not over-dre&s;s, nor leave her wholly bare</L></Q></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, we leave your ro|mantic Nature, and continue our View of her here, where &s;he is treated according to this Pre&s;cription of the Poet.&mdash;That Building is called the Temple of Contem|plation; tho&s;e Bas-relief Heads it is adorned with, are, I a&s;&s;ure you, extremely good ones.</P>

<P>We will walk up to it if you plea&s;e: It is a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>A mighty whim&s;ical Appearance it makes truly.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="27" REF="30">
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my Opinion it is a pretty Object enough, and varies our View in a very becoming manner. Its cool &s;tand up|on the Lake, and tho&s;e canvas Windows, de&s;igned as well to keep out the Sun, as let in the Air, give us a good Notion of the Manner of living in an hot Country. It is finely painted in the In&s;ide: Will you look into it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Finely painted indeed! Our Travellers tell us the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are a very in|genious People; and that Arts and Sciences flouri&s;h among&s;t them in great Beauty. But for my Part, whenever I &s;ee any of their Paintings, I am apt, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in every thing el&s;e to call their Ta&s;te into que&s;|tion. It is impo&s;&s;ible for one <HI>Art</HI> to be in Perfection, without introducing the re&s;t. They are all <HI>Links</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Chain:</HI> If you draw up one, you mu&s;t expect the re&s;t will follow. <HI>Cogno&s;citur ex &s;ocio,</HI> is an old Rule you know in judging of <HI>Men;</HI> and I believe it may be applied with as much Propriety in judging of <HI>Arts.</HI> It is hardly to be imagined that any <HI>Art,</HI> perfect in its Kind, would claim any Kindred, or even bear to keep Company with &s;uch a wretched <HI>Art of Painting</HI> as prevails among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;e:</HI> Its whole My&s;tery con&s;i&s;ts in dawbing on glaring Colours: Correctne&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="31">of Drawing, Beauty of Compo&s;ition, and harmony of colouring, they &s;eem not to have even the lea&s;t Notion of.</P>

<P>I like your Reflections extremely. We &s;hould certainly have &s;ome more elegant Productions from <HI>China,</HI> if they were able to an&s;wer the Character I have &s;ometimes heard given of them. They have very little of true, manly Ta&s;te, I fancy, among them: Their Ingenuity lies chiefly in the knick|knack Way; and is, I imagine, pretty much of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Kind.&mdash;Hold, Sir: This Way if you plea&s;e. We will walk again towards the River, and pur&s;ue it to the Canal.&mdash;It is divided, you &s;ee, in|to three Parts; one takes its Ri&s;e from the Grotto; another from the Pebble Bridge (as it is called) which is, I think, a pretty Object; and the third i&s;&s;ues from a dark Wood.&mdash;There, Sir, let me pre&s;ent you to an illu&s;trious &s;et of your gallant Countrymen. This Place is called the Tem|ple of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worthies; and is gloriou&s;ly filled, you &s;ee, with the greate&s;t Wits, Pa|triots, and Heroes, that are to be met with in our Chronicles.</P>

<P>Does not your Pul&s;e beat high, while you
<PB N="29" REF="32">thus &s;tand before &s;uch an awful A&s;&s;embly? Is not your Brea&s;t warmed by a Variety of grand Ideas, which this Sight mu&s;t give Birth to?&mdash;There you have a View of the calm Philo&s;ophers, who &s;ought Vir|tue in her Retirement, and benefited Man|kind by Thought and Meditation.&mdash; Some took the human Mind for their Theme, examined the various Powers it is endowed with, and gave us, <HI>to know our&s;elves.</HI>&mdash; Others took <HI>Nature</HI> for their Subject, look|ed thro' all her Works, and enlarged our Notions of a God.&mdash;While others, warmed with a generous Re&s;entment again&s;t Vice and Folly, made Morality their Care: To the cool Rea&s;oner &s;erious Philo&s;ophy, without any Ornament but Truth, was re|commended: To the gayer Di&s;po&s;ition the moral Song was directed, and the Heart was improved, while the Fancy was delighted: To tho&s;e who were yet harder to work upon, the Force of Example was made u&s;e of: Folly is put to the Te&s;t of Ridicule, and laughed out of countenance, while the moral Scene, like a di&s;torting Mirror, &s;hews the Villain his Features in &s;o deformed a Manner, that he &s;tarts at his own Image with Horror and Affright.&mdash;On the other Side you are pre&s;ented with a View of tho&s;e illu&s;trious Worthies, who &s;pent their Lives in Action; who left Retirement to the cool Philo&s;o|pher, entered into the Bu&s;tle of Mankind,
<PB N="30" REF="33">and pur&s;ued Virtue in the dazling Light in which &s;he appears to Patriots and Heroes.

<P>What an happy Man you are, thus to find an Opportunity of moralizing upon every Occa&s;ion!

<P>Why, Sir, you have there a View of the Kingdom of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us:</HI> That A&s;&s;embly is compo&s;ed of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and his Privy-council. But as I believe they will hardly pay us, by any Beauty in their Work|man&s;hip, for our Trouble, &s;hould we go round and make them a Vi&s;it; it is my Ad|vice
<PB N="31" REF="34">that we walk directly from hence to the Temple of Friend&s;hip, and &s;o return by that Terrace back again to tho&s;e Parts of the Garden that remain yet un&s;een.</P>

<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to follow you among&s;t the Trees, not more out of Complai&s;ance than Inclination: I like a cool Retreat as well as you. When I plan a Garden, I believe, I &s;hall deal much in &s;hady Walks; wherever I open a grand Terrace, I intend to lengthen out by its Side a clo&s;e Vi&s;ta: through the one I &s;hall lead Strangers, in the other enjoy my Friends. I am a great Admirer of walking in a Shade; it is a kind of Emblem of the mo&s;t agreeable Situation in Life, the retired one: Every fanta&s;tic View is hid from us, and we may if we plea&s;e, be Poets, or Philo&s;ophers, or what we will. I own I admire the Ta&s;te of the&s;e buzzing In&s;ects, &s;porting them&s;elves in the Shade; a glaring Sun &s;hine neither in the World, nor in a Walk, is agreeable to my Way of thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>If all the World thought as you do, we &s;hould have neither State&s;men to
<PB N="32" REF="35">mend our Laws, nor Coblers to mend our Shoes: We &s;hould all run and hide our|&s;elves among&s;t Trees, and what then would become of Society?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought you did not will|fully mi&s;take my Meaning, I would take the Trouble of telling you that I am an Advo|cate for no other <HI>Retirement</HI> than &s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with the Duties of Life. A Love for which kind of Retirement, <HI>properly qualified,</HI> is <HI>Health</HI> to the Mind; but when it is <HI>made up</HI> unskillfully, it throws us into a <HI>fatal Lethargy,</HI> from whence be|gins the Date of an u&s;ele&s;s Life. Every vir|tuous Mind, in a greater or a le&s;s Degree, has a turn this Way, and the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> I believe, ought to be at the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> Pains to guard a|gain&s;t carrying this Inclination into the Ex|treme.</P>

<P>And yet the Annals of mo&s;t Nations let us &s;ee that their greate&s;t Men have often indulged it; and much for the Benefit of Mankind too; witne&s;s many of the illu&s;trious Worthies we have ju&s;t been vi&s;iting: You forget the Panegyric you be|&s;towed upon them.</P>

On the contrary, this latter kind of Men have always &s;tood faire&s;t in my E&s;teem. The Life of a Reclu&s;e I would re|commend to none but a Valetudinarian. We were intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other as much as we are able. For my Part, it has always been my Opinion, that <HI>one good Man</HI> does more Service in the World, than <HI>a thou&s;and good Books.</HI>&mdash;But we'll drop our Ar|gument at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e I &s;ee we have fini&s;hed our Walk.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, it is a Piece of Sa|tyr: I am &s;ure you will like it if you will give your&s;elf the Trouble to examine it: It is in your Ta&s;te I know exactly.&mdash; There you &s;ee &s;its <HI>Britannia;</HI> upon one Side are held the Glory of her Annals, the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> III. and on the other is offered the Reign of &mdash;, which &s;he frowns upon, and puts by with her Hand.</P>

<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>With &s;o little Malevolence as I know you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, I do not think I ever met with any body in my Life &s;o eager to catch at any thing to blame; or to whom an Opportunity of that kind af|forded a more &s;eeming real Plea&s;ure than it does to you.&mdash;But I know it pro|ceeds from an hone&s;t Nature.&mdash;Well: Suppo&s;e we continue our Walk.&mdash;I look
<PB N="35" REF="38">upon that Statue as one of the fine&s;t in the World: I would give all the Money in my Pocket for a Sight of the Original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Po&s;ture always to me ap|pears a little too much &s;trained. I can &s;carce throw my&s;elf into &s;uch an attitude. Yet it is fine I mu&s;t confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have the be&s;t View of it, Sir, from hence. Mo&s;t of the Engravings I have met with give us the back View, but I think the Statue appears infinitely to the be&s;t Advantage when taken in Front. The Air of the Head is delightful, and cannot be hid without depriving the Figure of half its Life.&mdash;I am leading you now to that genteel Piece of Building which goes by the Name of the Palladian Bridge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een, I think, &s;omething like it at my Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>

<P>I believe, Sir, the Model was taken from thence. Tho' if I remember right, the Roof is there &s;upported by Pil|lars on both Sides.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is.&mdash;But what have we got there? You are taking me pa&s;t &s;ome|thing curious.</P>

<P>I beg your Pardon: Indeed I had almo&s;t forgot the Imperial Clo&s;et: And I wonder I &s;hould, for I a&s;&s;ure you I have the greate&s;t Veneration for its Inhabitants.&mdash; There, Sir, is a noble Triumvirate. <HI>Titus, Trajan,</HI> and <HI>Aurelius,</HI> are Names which want not the Pomp of Title to add a Lu&s;|tre to them.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h you could per&s;uade all the Kings in <HI>Europe</HI> to take them as Pat|terns. But, God knows, public Spirit is now at a low Ebb among&s;t us: There is more of it in that &s;ingle hone&s;t Sentiment, <HI>Pro me: &s;i merear, in me,</HI> than I believe is to be found in this degenerate Age in half a Kingdom.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let us have &s;ome|thing el&s;e to talk about.&mdash;Yon Wall at this Di&s;tance &s;eems to promi&s;e us &s;ome Ba&s;s-relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; you are there pre|&s;ented with a View of the different Quarters of the World, bringing their various Pro|ducts to <HI>Britannia.</HI> It is a pretty Orna|ment enough for a Bridge, which, like the Art of Navigation, joins one Land to ano|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay I much admire the Workman&s;hip. There is a great degree of Auk wardne&s;s in &s;everal of the Figures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really I am &s;o far of your way of thinking, that I mu&s;t own I am no great Admirer of this kind of Work, except it be extremely fine.&mdash;The be&s;t thing in this Way, that ever I met with, is a Piece of Alt-relief, which his Lord&s;hip keeps with|in Doors. We &s;hall &s;carce, I believe have time now, but we mu&s;t take an Opportu|nity of &s;eeing it before you leave the Coun|try. You will meet with likewi&s;e in tho&s;e Apartments &s;everal very good Pictures: I remember &s;pending an Afternoon about half a Year ago, in a very agreeable Manner a|mong&s;t them. But this Piece of Alt-relief
<PB N="38" REF="41">&s;truck me beyond every thing. The Story is <HI>Darius</HI>'s Tent; and it is &s;o charmingly told, that I have had, I can tell you, a meaner Opinion of <HI>Le Brun</HI> upon that Subject, ever &s;ince I have &s;een it: The Compo&s;ition is &s;o ju&s;t, the Figures &s;o grace|ful and correct, nay, the very Drapery &s;o free and ea&s;y, that I declare I was altogether a&s;toni&s;hed at the Sight of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; I &s;hall find &s;ome Op|portunity of paying it a Vi&s;it. There is &s;o much Art required, and &s;o much Difficulty attends doing any thing in this Way as it ought to be, that when we do meet with a good Piece of Workman&s;hip of this kind, it affords us an extreme Plea&s;ure.&mdash; So, Sir <HI>William,</HI> have I met you here! I &s;hould rather have expected to have &s;een you among the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worthies.&mdash; This &s;ame <HI>Penn,</HI> Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, is a great Favourite of mine. I e&s;teem him one of the mo&s;t worthy Legi&s;lators upon Record. His Laws, I am told, act &s;till with great Force in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> and keep the hone&s;t, inoffen&s;ive People there in extreme good Order.</P>

<P>Our Sailors mention his Colony as a very happy Set of People; they live en|tirely at Peace among&s;t them&s;elves; and

<P>No, Sir, I am not &s;o incu|rious as to &s;uffer any thing that has been in <HI>Italy</HI> to &s;lip my Notice: Some of tho&s;e par|ticularly that &s;tand on the Side next <HI>Raw|leigh,</HI> I was exceedingly taken with.</P>

<P>Pray what is your Opinion of checquered Marble's being made u&s;e of in Bu&s;ts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I never &s;ee any of the&s;e party-coloured Faces, but I am moved with Indignation at the Sculptor's ridiculous Humour. It is &s;o ab&s;urd a Ta&s;te, that I cannot conceive how it &s;hould ever enter into a Workman's Head, to make every Fea|ture of a Man's Face of a different Colour; and it amazes me, I a&s;&s;ure you, that we meet with daily &s;o many In&s;tances of &s;uch Ab|&s;urdity.&mdash;In &s;everal Parts of the Gar|den, I have had various Views of that old <HI>Gothic</HI> Building; we are now at la&s;t I hope moving towards it. I am &s;o wonderfully plea&s;ed with its outward Appearance, that
<PB N="40" REF="43">I &s;hall be di&s;appointed if I don't meet &s;ome thing an&s;werable within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as old as it looks, I a&s;&s;ure you it is not yet fini&s;hed. You will meet with nothing ornamental in the In&s;ide; &s;o I would have you per&s;uade your&s;elf it has al|ready done all in its Power to entertain you. And upon my Word I think it has done a great deal: Without it, I am &s;ure this Part of the Garden would be quite naked and lifele&s;s; nor would any other Part appear with &s;o much Beauty. It puts one in Mind of &s;ome generous Patriot in his Retirement; his own Neighbourhood feels mo&s;t the Ef|fects of that Bounty, which in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;preads it&s;elf over a whole Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like this Di&s;po&s;ition within, I a&s;&s;ure you, altogether as well as its Form without.&mdash;There are two or three Pieces of the be&s;t painted Gla&s;s that I have any where met with: Tho&s;e little hi&s;torical Pieces are exceedingly beautiful; and &s;o are tho&s;e Landskips likewi&s;e.&mdash;This Hill I think appears rather too naked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Throw your Eye over it then, and tell me if you are not ravi&s;hed with the View before you. Nothing certainly in the kind can be more beautiful or great,
<PB N="41" REF="44">than that pompous Pile ri&s;ing in &s;o mag|nificent a manner above the Wood. The Building cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;hewn to greater Advantage: The Appearance it <HI>makes</HI> pre|&s;ents you with an idea &s;ufficiently grand; yet your Imagination cannot be per&s;uaded but that it is in fact much grander, and that the Wood hides a great Part of what is to be &s;een from your Eye. This is a mo&s;t de|lightful manner of plea&s;ing: A grand Object left to a good Imagination to improve up|on, &s;eldom lo&s;es by its A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Our View likewi&s;e is greatly added to in point of Beauty, by tho&s;e &s;everal other &s;maller Buildings which offer them&s;elves, &s;ome only half hid among&s;t the Branches, and others ju&s;t peeping from among&s;t tufted Trees, which make very beautiful little gar|ni&s;hed Di&s;hes in this mo&s;t elegant Enter|tainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have thus painted the near Objects, let my Pencil, I beg, come in for a few rough Touches in the back|grounds: Without &s;omething of an Offskip, your Man of Art, you know, &s;eldom e&s;teems his View perfect. And in this Landskip there are as many beautiful Objects thrown off to a Di&s;tance as can well be imagined: That Variety of fine Wood; that bright Surface of Water, with the pointed Obelisk
<PB N="42" REF="45">in the Mid&s;t of it; tho&s;e two Pavilions up|on the Banks of the Canal; and the &s;till more di&s;tant View into the Country, are Objects which, in my Opinion, make no &s;mall Addition to the Beauty of your Land|skip; or, to carry on your Allu&s;ion, may very well come in as a &s;econd Cour&s;e in your Entertainment.&mdash; Our Attention, I think, in the next Place, is demanded by this venerable A&s;&s;embly. That old Gentle|man there &s;its with great Dignity: I like his Attitude extremely: If I under&s;tood the <HI>Runic</HI> Character, I might have known pro|bably (for this In&s;cription I fancy would in|form me) by what Title he is di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the Gracefulne&s;s of his Po&s;ture di&s;covers him to have been nothing le&s;s than an Hero of the fir&s;t Rank. He puts me in Mind of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, &s;itting in his Curule Chair to receive the <HI>Gauls.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, you have done him great Honour I mu&s;t own; but you have not yet honoured him according to his Dig|nity: He is nothing le&s;s, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, than the Repre&s;entative of a <HI>Saxon</HI> Deity. You &s;ee here
<Q><HI>Thor</HI> and <HI>Woden</HI> fabled Gods&mdash;</Q>
with the whole Sy&s;tem of your Ance&s;tor's
<PB N="43" REF="46">Theology. Walk round the A&s;&s;embly, they will &s;mile upon a true <HI>Briton,</HI> and try if you can acknowledge each by his di&s;tinct Symbol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s they do not to me &s;eem accoutered like Gods: For my Part, I &s;hould rather &s;u&s;pect them to be Statues of Heroes and Lawgivers, meta|morphi&s;ed into Divinities by the Courte&s;y of the Place: I &s;hall not however go about to di&s;pute their Titles; but like my good Ance&s;tors before me, acquie&s;ce piou&s;ly in what other People tell me.&mdash;Tho' I cannot &s;ay but that Lady there, bearing the Sun (who repre&s;ents I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Sunday</HI>) looks whim&s;ical enough; and makes ju&s;t &s;uch an Appearance as I could imagine the mi&s;led Conception of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic <HI>Saxon</HI> might mould his Deities into. But in the&s;e other Figures I mu&s;t own I cannot &s;ee Super&s;tition at all characterized, which you may ob&s;erve generally forms its Objects of Wor&s;hip into the mo&s;t mi&s;-created things that can po&s;&s;ibly enter the Imagination of Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, among&s;t the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> you may ob&s;erve &s;everal very well-&s;haped Deities: The <HI>Hercules,</HI> the <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the <HI>Venus,</HI> are at this Day Standards of Beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I am apt to attribute this rather to the Imagination of their Sculp|tors, than their Prie&s;ts. To <HI>&s;hew Art,</HI> ra|ther than to <HI>expre&s;s Religion,</HI> was the Point aimed at in the&s;e enchanting Pieces of Work|man&s;hip.&mdash;But when Super&s;tition acted without Controul; when the fanta&s;tic No|tions of Prie&s;ts were put into the Hands of ordinary Workmen, even among&s;t the po|lite <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves, Lord! what mis&s;hapen Mon&s;ters crouded into Temples, and reared them&s;elves aloft above Altars! Search other Countries likewi&s;e, <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Africa. China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> or any Place either ancient or modern, where Super&s;tition prevails, and I dare engage in the whole Catalogue of their Deities you will &s;carce meet with one that bears any thing like the human Shape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why their Demi-Gods, or ca|nonized Heroes, of which all pagan Nations had Abundance, were generally I fancy re|pre&s;ented in the human Form. And the&s;e <HI>Saxon</HI> Divinities, I &s;uppo&s;e, pretend not to any &s;uperior Rank &mdash; But however, as no Degree of Veneration is exacted from you, you may I think let them re&s;t quietly upon their Pede&s;tals, without any farther Mo|le&s;tation.&mdash;We have a good View into the Country from hence. Tho&s;e Woods are
<PB N="45" REF="48">extremely elegant in their kind; we mu&s;t certainly contrive to take a Ride thither &s;ome Evening. They are laid out in a very fine Manner, and cut into very beautiful Ridings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is the kind of Improve|ment that takes mo&s;t with me (let us &s;tep in here a Moment, we are caught I &s;ee in a Shower) I am altogether of the Poet's Opinion, that
<Q>'Tis <HI>U&s;e</HI> alone that &s;anctifies Expence.</Q>
Were I a Nobleman, I &s;hould endeavour to turn my E&s;tate into a Garden, and make my Tenants my Gardiners: In&s;tead of u&s;ele&s;s Temples, I would build Farm-hou&s;es; and in&s;tead of cutting out unmeaning Vi&s;tas, I would beautify and mend Highways: The Country &s;hould &s;mile upon my Labours, and the Public &s;hould partake in my Plea&s;ures. What &s;ignifies all this o&s;tentatious Work? Is any Man the better for it? Is it not Money mo&s;t vilely &s;quandered away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from it, that I a&s;&s;ure you, con&s;idered even in a public Light, I look upon it as an Expence that may very pro|perly be &s;aid to be &s;anctified by <HI>U&s;e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="49">
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you are going to tell me that it feeds two or three poor Labour|ers; and when you have &s;aid this, I know not what more you can &s;ay to defend it. But how is it po&s;&s;ible for a Man to throw away his Money without doing &s;ome Ser|vice in the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? Why by &s;pending it in gaming, to the Encouragement of Cheats and Sharpers: By &s;quandering it away upon Lu&s;ts and Appetites, in the Support of Stews and Bawdy-hou&s;es: Or by Dealing it out in Bribes, in oppo&s;ition to Hone&s;ty, and to advance Corruption. In Arts like the&s;e, what Numbers con&s;ume their Wealth! It is not enough for them to prevent Mankind's being benefited by their affluent Mankind's being benefited by their affluent Circum&s;tan|ces; but they do their utmo&s;t, while they dimini&s;h their Fortunes, to make all they can influence as worthle&s;s as them&s;elves. So that I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hould look upon it as a very great Point gained, if all our Men of Fortune would only take care that their Wealth proves of no Di&s;&s;ervice to Mankind. Tho' I am far from de&s;iring they &s;hould &s;top there: I would have them endeavour to turn it into &s;ome u&s;eful Channel. And in my Opinion, it is laid out in a very laudable Manner, when it is &s;pent, as it is here, in circulating thro' a Variety of Trades, in &s;up|porting
<PB N="47" REF="50">a Number of poor Families, and in the Encouragement of Art and Indu&s;try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I confe&s;s Wealth thus laid out, is beneficial to a Country; but &s;till you keep from the Point: I ask whether all the&s;e good Ends would not be an&s;wered, and more too, were this Wealth laid out according to my Scheme, in public Works, or &s;omething of an <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you have no Notion of any U&s;e ari&s;ing from the&s;e elegant Productions of Art: You cannot conceive how they &s;hould be of any Service to the Public. Why you are a mere <HI>Goth,</HI> an unpoli&s;hed <HI>Vandal;</HI> were you impowered to reform the Age, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould &s;ee you, like one of tho&s;e wild mi&s;guided People, cour&s;ing furiou&s;ly round the Land, and laying de&s;olate every thing beautiful you met with. But in my Opinion, Sir, the&s;e noble Productions of Art, con&s;idered merely as &s;uch, may be looked upon as Works of a very public Na|ture. Do you think no <HI>End</HI> is an&s;wered when a Nation's Ta&s;te is regulated with re|gard to the mo&s;t innocent, the mo&s;t refined, and elegant of its Plea&s;ures? In all polite Countries the Amu&s;ements of the People were thought highly de&s;erving a Legi&s;lator's In&s;pection. To e&s;tabli&s;h a ju&s;t Ta&s;te in the&s;e,
<PB N="48" REF="51">was e&s;teemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure as advancing the Intere&s;t of Virtue: And can it be con|&s;idered as a Work entirely of a private Na|ture, for a &s;uperior Genius to exert it&s;elf in an Endeavour to fix a true Standard of Beau|ty in any of the&s;e allowed and u&s;eful kinds of Plea&s;ure? In the Way of Gardening par|ticularly, the Ta&s;te of the Nation has long been &s;o depraved, that I &s;hould think we might be obliged to any one that would un|dertake to reform it. While a Ta&s;te for Painting, Mu&s;ic, Architecture, and other polite Arts, in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevailed a|mong&s;t us, our Gardens for the mo&s;t Part were laid out in &s;o formal, auk ward, and wretched a Manner, that they were really a Scandal to the very Genius of the Nation; a Man of Ta&s;te was &s;hocked whenever he &s;et his Foot into them. But <HI>Stow,</HI> it is to be hoped, may work &s;ome Reformation: I would have our Country Squires flock hither two or three times in a Year, by way of Im|provement, and after they have looked about them a little, return Home with new No|tions, and begin to &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity of their clipped Yews, their Box-wood Borders, their flouri&s;hed Parterres, and their lofty Brick-walls.&mdash;You may &s;mile, but! a&s;&s;ure you &s;uch an Improvement of public Ta&s;te, tho' there is no Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider it as a matter of the fir&s;t Importance, is cer|tainly
<PB N="49" REF="52">a Concern that ought by no means to be neglected. Perhaps indeed I may carry the Matter farther than the generality of People; but to me I mu&s;t own there ap|pears a very vi&s;ible Connection between an <HI>improved</HI> Ta&s;te for Plea&s;ure, and a Ta&s;te for Virtue: When I &s;it ravi&s;hed at an Ora|torio, or &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed before the Car|toons, or enjoy my&s;elf in the&s;e happy Walks, I can feel my Mind expand it&s;elf, my Notions enlarge, and my Heart better di&s;po&s;ed either for a religious Thought, or a benevolent Action: In a Word, I cannot help imagining a Ta&s;te for the&s;e exalted Plea|&s;ures contributes towards making me a bet|ter Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God! what an Enthu&s;ia&s;t you are! Polite Arts improve Virtue! an A&s;&s;ertion indeed for a Philo&s;opher to make. Why are they not always con&s;idered as ha|ving a natural Tendency to Luxury, to Riot, and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more, in my Opinion, than a whole&s;ome Meal has to a Surfeit, or reading the Scriptures to Here&s;y: All things are capable, we know, of Abu&s;e; and per|haps the be&s;t things the mo&s;t capable: And tho' this may indeed argue a Depravity in <HI>us,</HI> yet it by no means, I think, argues a Tendency
<PB N="50" REF="53">in <HI>them</HI> to deprave us. However, (to let what I have yet &s;aid &s;tand for nothing) I can tell you one very great Piece of Service ari&s;ing to the Country from Wealth laid cut in this elegant manner, which you &s;eem &s;o much to grumble at; and that is, the Money &s;pent in the Neighbourhood by the Company daily crouding hither to &s;atisfy their Curio&s;ity. We have a kind of a con|tinual Fair; and I have heard &s;everal of the Inhabitants of the neighbouring Town a&s;|&s;ert, that it is one of the be&s;t Trades they have: Their Inns, their Shops, their Farms, and Shambles, all find their Account in it: So that, in my Opinion, viewed in this Light only, &s;uch Productions of Art may be con|&s;idered as very great Advantages to every Neighbourhood that enjoys the lucky Situa|tion of being placed near them. &mdash;To this Advantage might be added, the great Degree of Plea&s;ure from hence derived daily to &s;uch Numbers of People: A Place like this is a kind of keeping open Hou&s;e, there is a Repa&s;t at all times ready for the Enter|tainment of Strangers. And &s;ure if you have any Degree of Benevolence, you mu&s;t think an <HI>u&s;eful End</HI> an&s;wered in thus affording an innocent Gratification to &s;o many of your Fellow-creatures. A <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening &s;pent here, adds a new Reli&s;h to the Day of Re&s;t and makes the Sabbath appear more chearful
<PB N="51" REF="54">to the Labourer after a toil&s;ome Week. For my Part, I a&s;&s;ure you I have &s;carce expe|rienced a greater Plea&s;ure than I have often felt upon meeting a Variety of plea&s;ed Faces in the&s;e Walks: All Care and Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to be left behind at the Garden-door, and People enter here fully re&s;olved to enjoy them&s;elves, and the &s;everal beautiful Ob|jects around them: In one Part a Face pre|&s;ents it&s;elf marked with the Pa&s;&s;ion of gap|ing Wonder; in another you meet a Coun|tenance bearing the Appearance of a more rational Plea&s;ure; and in a third, a Sett of Features compo&s;ed into &s;erene Joy; while the Man of Ta&s;te is &s;een examining every Beauty with a curious Eye, and di&s;covering his Approbation in an half-formed Smile.&mdash; To this I might &s;till add another Advantage, of a public Nature, derived from the&s;e ele|gant Productions of Art; and that is their Tendency to rai&s;e us in the Opinion of Fo|reigners. If our Nation had nothing of this kind to boa&s;t of, all our Neighbours would look upon us a &s;tupid, ta&s;tele&s;s Set of People, and not worth vi&s;iting. So that for the Credit of the Country, I think, &s;omething of this kind ought to be exhibited among&s;t us. Our public Virtues, if we have any, would not, I dare &s;ay, appear to le&s;s Ad|vantage when recommended by the&s;e Em|belli&s;hments of Art.</P>

<P>I wonder you &s;hould not know me better than to imagine I am always in earne&s;t when I find fault. My Thoughts and yours, I a&s;&s;ure you, agree exactly upon this Subject. I only wanted to engage you in &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e till the Shower was over; and as the Sky &s;eems now quite clear, if you will, we'll venture out, and vi&s;it what we have yet to &s;ee.</P>

<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a humorous Fellow: This is not the fir&s;t time you have made me play my Lungs to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;As we walk along this Terrace, you may ob&s;erve the great Advantage of low Walls: By this means the Garden is extended beyond its Limits, and takes in every thing entertain|ing that is to be met with in the range of half a County. Villages, Works of Hus|bandry, Groups of Cattle, Herds of Deer, and a Variety of other beautiful Objects, are brought into the Garden, and make a Part of the Plan. Even to the <HI>nice&s;t</HI> Ta&s;te the&s;e rural Scenes are highly delightful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay you may add, that whoever has no Reli&s;h for them, gives Rea&s;on for a Su&s;picion that he has no Ta&s;te at all.</P>
<Q><L>Straight mine Eye hath caught new Plea&s;ures</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the Landskip round it mea&s;ures;</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="56">Ru&s;&s;et Lawns, and Fallows gray,</L>
<L>Where the nibbling flocks do &s;tray;</L>
<L>Mountains, on who&s;e barren Brea&s;t</L>
<L>The labouring Clouds do often re&s;t;</L>
<L>Meadows trim with Dai&s;ies pide,</L>
<L>Shallow Brooks, and Rivers wide:</L>
<L>Towers and Battlements it &s;ees</L>
<L>Bo&s;om'd high in tufted Trees,</L>
<L>Where perhaps &s;ome Beauty lies,</L>
<L>The Cyno&s;ure of neighbouring Eyes.</L>
<L>Hard by a Cottage Chimney &s;mokes,</L>
<L>From betwixt two aged Oaks.</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you repeat no more? I could have li&s;tened with great Plea&s;ure if you had gone on with the whole Piece. It is quite Nature: That View of an old Ca&s;tle, <HI>bo|&s;om'd high in tufted Trees,</HI> plea&s;es me ex|ceedingly: And the two following Lines,
<Q><L>Where perhaps &s;ome Beauty lies,</L>
<L>The Cyno&s;ure of neighbouring Eyes,</L></Q>
give it an elegant, romantic Air; and add greatly to the Idea before conceived.&mdash; But to pur&s;ue our former Argument: It mu&s;t be owned indeed that the&s;e Walks want &s;uch Openings into the Country as little as any Place can well be imagined to do; yet even <HI>Stow</HI> it&s;elf, I a&s;&s;ure you, is much improved
<PB N="54" REF="57">by them. They contra&s;t beautifully with this more poli&s;hed Nature, and &s;et it off to greater Advantage. After &s;urfeiting it&s;elf with the Fea&s;t here provided for it, the Eye, by u&s;ing a little Exerci&s;e in travelling about the Country, grows hungry again, and re|turns to the Entertainment with fre&s;h Appe|tite. Be&s;ides, there is nothing &s;o di&s;ta&s;teful to the Eye as a confined Pro&s;pect (where the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it does not appear) e&s;pe|cially if a dead Wall, or any other &s;uch di&s;|agreeable Object &s;teps in between. The Eye naturally loves Liberty, and when it is in que&s;t of Pro&s;pects, will not re&s;t content with the mo&s;t beautiful Di&s;po&s;itions of Art, con|fined within a narrow Compa&s;s, but (as &s;oon as the Novelty of the Sight is over) will be|gin to grow di&s;&s;atisfied, till the whole Limits of the Horizon be given it to range through.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Eye, according to your Ac|count, &s;eems to be &s;omething like a Bee: Plant as many Flowers as you will near its Hive, yet &s;till the little In&s;ect will be di&s;contented, unle&s;s it be allowed to wander o'er the Country, and be its own Caterer. &mdash; I have got a few very &s;evere Exclamations at my Tongue's End, which I will not vent till you have told me the Architect's Name, who has loaded the Ground with that mon&s;trous Piece of Build|ing,
<PB N="55" REF="58">tho' I believe I can gue&s;s him without your Information.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suffer me to intercede in his Behalf. You are &s;o unmerciful a Reprover, that I have not Patience to hear you. The Room above is de&s;igned, I am told, to be fitted up in a very elegant manner; but as very little is yet done to it, we &s;hall find nothing I fancy to an&s;wer the Trouble of going up Stairs.&mdash;This Part of the Garden, you &s;ee, is yet unfini&s;hed. If we have the Plea|&s;ure of your Company in this Country next Year, you will &s;ee I dare &s;ay great Alterations here. That <HI>Ba&s;e</HI> is to &s;hoot up into a lofty Monument: And &s;everal of tho&s;e Objects you &s;ee before you are to take new Forms upon them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yonder likewi&s;e &s;eems to be a Monument <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this View of the Gardens was taken, the Monu|ment here &s;poken of has been fini&s;hed. The following Lines are a Tran&s;lation of its In&s;cription, which in the Original is wrote in Latin.
<Q><LG>
<L>As a Monument</L>

</LG></Q></NOTE> ri&s;ing: Pray who is it intended to do Honour to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, it is intended to do Honour to a Gentleman, who has done Ho|nour to his Country: It is dedicated to the Memory of Captain <HI>Grenville,</HI> and joins
<PB N="56" REF="59">with the Nation in applauding a Man, who pu&s;hed forwards by Honour, and a Love for his Country, met Danger and Death with the Spirit of a <HI>Roman.</HI> &mdash;Well, how do you like the Plan which you &s;ee laid out before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polypth.</SPEAKER>
<P>As far as I can judge of the fu|ture Landskip from this Sketch, it will be an admirable one. I am extremely taken with it. That Ba&s;on has a very fine Effect.&mdash; I could return back the &s;ame Round with great Plea&s;ure, but my Watch informs me that Mr. &mdash;, has been expecting us this half Hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Calloph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it &s;o late? The Time has &s;tole off very &s;lily. However you need be under no
<PB N="57" REF="60">Apprehen&s;ions; that hone&s;t Gentleman is &s;eldom very ha&s;ty in his Motions.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed their Round, our two Gentlemen directed their Faces back again towards the Gate.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Polypthon,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;our Hu|mour he had given &s;o many Evidences of in his Walk, began now to relent, and could talk of nothing but the agreeable Entertain|ment that had been afforded him. Some|times he would run out into the highe&s;t En|comiums of the many beautiful Terminations of the &s;everal Walks and Vi&s;tas; and ob&s;erve how many U&s;es each Object &s;erved, and in how many different Lights it was made to vary it&s;elf. <Q>For In&s;tance, &s;ays he, the Pavilion you &s;hewed me from the Tem|ple of <HI>Venus,</HI> terminates that Terrace in a very grand Manner; and makes like|wi&s;e a very magnificent Appearance, where it corre&s;ponds with another of the &s;ame Form, at the Entrance into the Park: Yet the &s;ame Building, like a Per|&s;on acquainted with the World, who can &s;uit his Behaviour to Time and Place, can vary it&s;elf upon occa&s;ion into a more hum|ble Shape, and when viewed thro' a re|tired Vi&s;ta, can take upon it the lowly Form of a clo&s;e Retreat.</Q>&mdash;When
<PB N="58" REF="61">he had enlarged pretty copiou&s;ly upon this Subject, he would next launch out into the highe&s;t Prai&s;es of the va&s;t Variety of Objects that was every where to be met with: <Q>Men of all Humours, &s;ays he, will here find &s;omething plea&s;ing and &s;uited to their Ta&s;te. The thoughtful may meet with retired Walks calculated in the be&s;t Man|ner for Contemplation: The gay and chearful may &s;ee Nature in her lovelie&s;t Dre&s;s, and meet Objects corre&s;ponding with their mo&s;t lively Flights. The ro|mantic Genius may entertain it&s;elf with &s;everal very beautiful Objects in its own Ta&s;te, and grow wild with Ideas of the inchanted kind. The di&s;con&s;olate Lover may hide him&s;elf in &s;hady Groves, or me|lancholy wander along the Banks of Lakes and Canals; where he may &s;igh to the gentle Zephyrs; mingle his Tears with the bubbling Water; or where he may have the be&s;t Opportunity, if his Malady be grown to &s;uch an Height, of ending his De&s;pair, and fini&s;hing his Life with all the Decency and Pomp of a Lover in a Romance. In &s;hort, &s;ays he, the&s;e Gar|dens are a very good Epitome of the World: They are calculated for Minds of every Stamp, and give free Scope to Inclinations of every kind: And if it be &s;aid that in &s;ome Parts they too much hu|mour
<PB N="59" REF="62">the debauched Ta&s;te of the Sen&s;u|ali&s;t, it cannot be denied on the other hand, but that they afford &s;everal very noble In|citements to Honour and Virtue.</Q>&mdash;But what beyond all other things &s;eemed mo&s;t to plea&s;e him, was the amicable and beauti|ful Conjunction of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> thro' the whole: He ob&s;erved that the <HI>former</HI> never appeared &s;tiff, or the <HI>latter</HI> extra|vagant.</P>
<P>Upon many other Topicks of Prai&s;e <HI>Po|lypthon</HI> run out with great Warmth. <HI>Cal|lophilus</HI> &s;eemed &s;urprized, and could not forbear asking him, By what means his Opinions became &s;o &s;uddenly changed? <Q>Why, &s;ays he, Sir, I have &s;aid nothing now that contradicts any thing I &s;aid be|fore. I own I met with two or three Objects that were not entirely to my Ta&s;te, which I am far from condemning for that Rea&s;on; tho' if I &s;hould, it is nothing to the purpo&s;e, becau&s;e I am now taking a Survey of the whole together; in which Light I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed with the View before me. Be|&s;ides, I hate one of your wondering Mor|tals, who is perpetually breaking out into a Note of Admiration at every thing he &s;ees: I am always apt to &s;u&s;pect his Ta&s;te or his Sincerity. It is impo&s;&s;ible that
<PB N="60" REF="63">all Genius's can alike agree in their Opinions of any Work of Art; and the Man who never <HI>blames,</HI> I can &s;carce be|lieve is qualified to <HI>commend.</HI> Be&s;ides, finding fault now and then, adds Weight to Commendation, and makes us believed to be in earne&s;t. However, notwith|&s;tanding what you may think of my fre|quent Cavils, I a&s;&s;ure you, with the greate&s;t Sincerity, I never before &s;aw any thing of the kind at all comparable to what I have here &s;een: I &s;hall by no means clo&s;e this Day with a <HI>Diem perdidi;</HI> nor would the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor him&s;elf, I be|lieve, have made the Reflection if he had &s;pent his condemned Hours in this Place.</Q></P>
<P>By this time the Gentlemen were come to the Gate, thro' which <HI>Polypthon</HI> a&s;&s;ured his Friend he pa&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t Re|luctance, and went growling out of this delightful Garden, as the Devil is &s;aid to have done out of Paradi&s;e.</P>
