<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG other di&s;ea&s;es incident to the human frame, tho&s;e of the eyes are peculiar to Egypt, where the blind are numerous. This affliction ought not, however, to be attributed to the reflected beams of a burning &s;un; for the Arabs, who live amid&s;t &s;ands, generally have good eyes, and a piercing &s;ight: nor mu&s;t we think with <HI>Ha&s;&s;alqui&s;t,</HI> who&s;e &s;tay was &s;hort in the country, that the di&s;ea&s;e was occa|&s;ioned by the exhalations of the &s;tagnant waters; for the French merchants, who&s;e hou&s;es are on the banks of the canal of Grand Cairo; that, for &s;ix months in the year, contains water, the &s;mell of which is in&s;up|portable, would be all blind; and for the&s;e fifty years, not one has lo&s;t his &s;ight. The origin of this di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
no doubt, is the Egyptian cu&s;tom of &s;leeping in the open air, on the terraces of their hou&s;es, or near their huts, during &s;ummer. From what <HI>Volney</HI> remarks on this &s;ubject, it appears, the &s;ea-air contributes very much to dim the organs of &s;ight, in this mi&s;ty at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Defluxions on the eyes, &s;ays he, are not peculiar to Egypt, they are al&s;o frequent in Syria; with this dif|ference, that they are le&s;s general; and that the in|habitants of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, are alone &s;ubject to them.</P>
<P>In the city of Cairo, which is always full of filth, the&s;e di&s;orders are more prevalent, than in all the re&s;t of Egypt. The common people are more liable to them, than per&s;ons in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and the natives more than foreigners. The prodigious num|ber of per&s;ons in this city, who&s;e &s;ight is either gone, or impaired, is &s;carce credible. Of a hundred per&s;ons, adds the above writer, I have met while walking the &s;treets of Cairo, twenty have been quite blind, ten wanting an eye, and twenty others have had their eyes red, purulent, or blemi&s;hed. Almo&s;t every one wears a fillet, a token of an approaching or convale&s;cent opthalmy; but nothing is more a&s;toni&s;hing, than the indifference and apathy, with which they &s;upport &s;o dreadful a misfortune. <HI>It was decreed,</HI> &s;ays the Mu&s;|&s;ulman;
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<HI>prai&s;e be to God! God has willed it,</HI> &s;ays the Chri&s;tian, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be his name!</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e defluxions happen at no certain &s;ea&s;on. They are an endemial di&s;order, common to every month of the year, and to every age. The cu&s;tom of &s;leeping in the air, to which it is generally attributed, is not adequate to the effects a&s;cribed to it; for, in countries remote from the &s;ea, the inhabitants al&s;o &s;leep on their terraces, and yet their &s;ight is not in|jured. If, therefore, at Cairo, in the Delta, and on the coa&s;t of Syria, it is dangerous to &s;leep in the open air, this air, mu&s;t acquire &s;ome noxious qua|lity from the vicinity of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual diet of the Egyptians appears, likewi&s;e, to be a powerful cau&s;e. The chee&s;e, &s;our milk, honey, confection of grapes, green fruits, and raw vegetables, the ordinary food of the people, produce in the &s;tomach, a di&s;order, which phy&s;icians have ob|&s;erved, to affect the &s;ight. Bodies, thus nouri&s;hed, abound in corrupted humours, which are con&s;tantly en|deavouring a di&s;charge. Diverted from the ordinary channels, by habitual per&s;piration, they fly to the ex|terior parts, and naturally attack the head; becau&s;e the Egyptians, by &s;having it once a week, and keep|ing it very warm, principally attract the per&s;piration there; and, if the head receives ever &s;o &s;light an im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of cold, on being uncovered, this per&s;pira|tion is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and falls upon the teeth; or &s;till more readily upon the eyes, as being the tendere&s;t part. On every fre&s;h cold, this organ is weakened, and at length finally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Blindne&s;s is, in many in&s;tances, occa&s;ioned by the con&s;equences of the &s;mall-pox. This di&s;order, which is very fatal in that country, is not well treated; during the three fir&s;t days, confection of grapes, honey and &s;ugar, are admini&s;tered to the &s;ick; and, after the &s;eventh, they are allowed milk, meat, and &s;alt-fi&s;h, as if they were in full health. Inoculation is not unknown to them, but little practi&s;ed. They perform the ope|ration, in a manner different from us, by in&s;erting a thread into the fle&s;h, or by making the patient inhale, or &s;wallow the powder of dried pu&s;tules.</P>
<P>Another very general di&s;temper at Cairo, is, that which the vulgar there call the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed evil;</HI> and which we al&s;o improperly term, the <HI>Neapolitan di&s;order:</HI> one half of Cairo is infected with it. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants, believe it proceeds from fright, from witchcraft, or from uncleanline&s;s. Some &s;u&s;pect the real cau&s;e; but as that is connected with a &s;ubject, on which they are remarkably re&s;erved, they chu&s;e not to mention it. This ble&s;&s;ed evil is very difficult to cure; mercury, under whatever form admini&s;tered, gene|rally
<PB N="7" REF="7">
fails; &s;udorific vegetables &s;ucceed better, with|out being however infallible; happily, the virus is not very active, from the great natural and artificial per|&s;piration. We &s;ee there, as in Spain, old men carry|ing this di&s;order about them, to the age of eighty. But the danger is imminent, to &s;uch as carry it into a cold country; for it there never fails to make a rapid progre&s;s, and &s;hews it&s;elf always more inveterate from this tran&s;plantation.</P>
<P>Several modern authors, with <HI>M. Paw</HI> at their head, have &s;aid, the pe&s;tilence is native in Egypt. Foreign phy&s;icians, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> who have re&s;ided there twenty or thirty years, have a&s;&s;ured me, this epidemic di&s;ea&s;e was brought thither by the Turks. A proof that it is not native in Egypt is, that, except in time of great famine, it never breaks out in Grand Cairo, nor the inland towns, but always begins at &s;ea ports, on the arrival of Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and travels to the ca|pital; whence it proceeds as far as Syene. Having come to a period in Grand Cairo, and being again in|troduced, by the people of Upper Egypt, it renews with greater fury, and &s;ometimes &s;weeps off two or three hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls; but always &s;tops in the month of June; or tho&s;e who catch it then are always cured.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">We ought not to pa&s;s over another &s;triking re|mark, which is, that the exce&s;s of heat and cold, are equally de&s;tructive of this dreadful contagion; win|ter kills it in Con&s;tantinople; and &s;ummer, in Egypt; it &s;eldom reaches the polar circle, and never pa&s;&s;es the tropic. The caravavs of Grand Cairo, Dama&s;|cus, and I&s;pahan, which are &s;ometimes infected, never propagate it at Mecca; and Yemen, is &s;afe from the plague.</P>
<P>The Europeans, &s;tand agha&s;t with fear, at the cala|mities it produces in Grand Cairo. According to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms, this city contains from eight to nine hundred thou&s;and inhabitants. They are &s;o crowded, that two hundred citizens here, occupy le&s;s &s;pace than thirty at Paris. The &s;treets are very narrow, and always full of people, who croud and jo&s;tle each other; and the pa&s;&s;enger is &s;ometimes obliged to wait &s;everal minutes, before he can make his way. One per&s;on, with the plague, will communicate it to a hundred; its progre&s;s is rapid, and &s;preads with the violence of a conflagration, the flames of which are augmented by the wind.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e breaks out, the French &s;hut up their di&s;trict, and intercept all communication with the city. Arab &s;ervants, who live without, every day bring them &s;uch provi&s;ions as they want; and, except
<PB N="9" REF="9">
bread, which does not communicate the infection, they throw what they bring through an aperture, cut in each door, into a tub of water, by which it is purified and u&s;ed without fear. The&s;e precautions give health and life to the French merchants, while &s;ur|rounded with all the horrors of death.</P>
<P>Burials, funeral proce&s;&s;ions, and tears, are in every &s;treet; for, like the Turks and Greeks, when the Egyptians bury their relations and friends, there are hired mourners, who make the air re&s;ound with their lamentations; and de&s;olate mothers, who, groaning, cover their faces with du&s;t, rend their cloaths, at|tending to the grave the child they have nurtured, and whom they &s;oon follow; for the Ea&s;tern people, more pious than we are, never for&s;ake their infected relations, but a&s;&s;i&s;t them to the la&s;t moment, though almo&s;t certain their affection will be fatal. The&s;e cries of de&s;pair, and funeral pomp, &s;pread a general con&s;ternation, and the French tremble in their a&s;ylums. Who, indeed, without terror, could &s;ee humanity &s;uf|fering under &s;o fearful a vi&s;itation?</P>
<P>All do not die who are attacked; but there are, &s;ometimes, no le&s;s than three hundred thou&s;and peo|ple carried off by this pe&s;tilence, in Grand Cairo. Could it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the example of the French, who, when the contagion is pa&s;t, leave their hou&s;es
<PB N="10" REF="10">
&s;afe, and in health, would not induce the Turks to u&s;e like precautions? Could it be imagined, that throughout the whole Ottoman empire, quarantine is not performed at one &s;ingle port; or merits a nation like this, to inhabit a country of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of their Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>TWO powerful cau&s;es have contributed to render Cairo, the &s;eat of an exten&s;ive commerce; the fir&s;t of which is, that all the commodities con&s;umed in Egypt, are collected within the walls of that city; and all the per&s;ons of property, that is, the Mamlouks and lawyers, are a&s;&s;embled there, and draw thither their whole revenue.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the &s;ituation, which makes this city a centre of circulation; while, by the Red Sea, it cor|re&s;ponds
<PB N="11" REF="11">
with Arabia and India; by the Nile, with Aby&s;&s;inia, and the interior parts of Africa; and by the Mediterranean, with Europe and the empire of Tur|key. Every year, a caravan from Aby&s;&s;inia arrives at Cairo, and brings from a thou&s;and to twelve hun|dred black &s;laves; as al&s;o elephants' teeth, gold du&s;t, o&s;trich feathers, gums, parrots, and monkeys; while another de&s;tined for Mecca, leaves the extremities of Morocco, and receiving pilgrims, even from the river of Senegal, coa&s;ts along the Mediterranean, collecting tho&s;e of Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis, and arrives by the de&s;art at Alexandria; con&s;i&s;ting of not le&s;s than three or four thou&s;and camels. From thence it pro|ceeds to Cairo, where it joins the caravan of Egypt. They then jointly &s;et out for Mecca, where they ar|rive one hundred days after. But the pilgrims of Mo|rocco, who have &s;ix hundred leagues more to travel, do not reach home, till after an ab&s;ence of more than a year. The lading of the&s;e caravans con&s;i&s;ts in India &s;tuffs, &s;hawls, gums, pearls, perfumes, and e&s;pe|cially the coffee of Yemen.</P>
<P>The &s;ame commodities arrive by another route at Suez. Cairo does not retain the whole of this mer|chandize; but, be&s;ides what is there con&s;umed, con|&s;iderable profits ari&s;e from the duties, and the &s;ums expended by the pilgrims. On the other hand, &s;mall caravans arrive, from time to time, from Dama&s;cus,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
with &s;ilk, oils, and fruits. During the favourable &s;ea&s;on, there are likewi&s;e ve&s;&s;els in the road of Damietta, unloading hog&s;heads of tobacco, from La|tahia; the con&s;umption of which, in Egypt, is enor|mous. Others arrive &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at Alexandria, bringing clothing, arms, fur, pa&s;&s;engers, and wrought &s;ilk, from Con&s;tantinople. Ve&s;&s;els come likewi&s;e from Mar&s;cilles, Leghorn, and Venice, with cloths, cochi|neal, Lyons' &s;tuffs and laces, grocery, paper, iron, lead, Venetian &s;equins, and German dahlers. All the&s;e articles, conveyed by &s;ea to Ro&s;etta, in barks, are fir&s;t landed there, then reimbarked on the Nile, and &s;ent to Cairo.</P>
<P>From this account, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that com|merce &s;hould continue &s;o flouri&s;hing in the capital of Egypt; and we need not he&s;itate to believe the re|port of the commi&s;&s;ioner-general of the cu&s;toms, who a&s;&s;erted, in 1783, that Cairo had traded to the amount of very near &s;ix millions and a half &s;terling.</P>
<P>But, if we examine the channels into which this wealth is poured; if we con&s;ider, that great part of the merchandize and coffee of India, pa&s;&s;es into foreign countries, the value of which is paid in goods from Europe and Turkey; that the con&s;umption of the country, almo&s;t entirely con&s;i&s;ts of articles of luxury, completely fini&s;hed, and that the produce
<PB N="13" REF="13">
given in return, is chiefly raw materials; we &s;hall per|ceive, that all this commerce is carried on, without contributing greatly to the real riches of Egypt, or the benefit of the people.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Ptolemies,</HI> the haven of Alexandria re|ceived the merchandize of the whole world; and the city became, as <HI>Strabo</HI> calls it, the greate&s;t emporium on earth. There was then a canal continued between the Nile, and the Red Sea. This work, was com|pleted under <HI>Ptolemy Philadelphus.</HI> It began at the Pelu&s;iac branch, and was carried to Ar&s;inoe, now Ag|geront, di&s;tant two leagues from the port of Suez; for thus far, the &s;ea has retired &s;ince that aera. Locks, con&s;tructed at its mouth, prevented a too ha&s;ty &s;tream; and there were lakes which &s;upplied it where boats might &s;top.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ptolemies</HI> kept up a formidable marine in the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean, to protect the Egyptian merchants. <HI>Theocritus</HI> affirms, they had ninety-&s;even fir&s;t-rate &s;hips, &s;everal of which were two hundred feet long; and four thou&s;and barks, to bear orders throughout the empire. By &s;uch means, <HI>Pto|lemy Philadelphus</HI> extended his conque&s;ts far into Ethiopia, and Yemen, and reigned over thirty-three thou&s;and cities. The&s;e facts would appear incre|dible, were they not atte&s;ted by writers of good au|thority;
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and did we not know to what degree of &s;plen|dor, commerce might rai&s;e a &s;tate.</P>
<P>Following the example of his predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Ptolemy Evergetes</HI> founded his power on trade, to which he gave every encouragement, maintained the marine of the Red Sea, &s;ubjugated &s;everal of the kings of Ho|meritae, who reigned in Arabia Felix, commanded them to guard the high roads, and effectually protect|ed caravans from the Arabs. The wealth of Egypt was at its utmo&s;t under his reign; and the abundance of gold and riches of all kinds, ever productive of ex|ce&s;&s;ive luxury in Alexandria, corrupted the court of its kings. Mo&s;t men are virtuous in mediocrity; mi&s;|fortune elevates the mind, and imparts energy, but exce&s;&s;ive pro&s;perity enervates; and, by opening the flood-gates of vice, &s;huts tho&s;e of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ptolemies</HI> enjoying &s;upreme power, abandon|ed them&s;elves to effeminacy, irre&s;olution, and di&s;or|ders, which infected the morals of their &s;ubjects; for the corruption of kingdoms always begins with that of the great. The fourth of the&s;e princes, however, performed &s;ome good acts. He al&s;o kept up, and maintained, the marine his ance&s;tors had created. Un|der his reign, were ve&s;&s;els of a &s;ize &s;o enormous, that they have never &s;ince been equalled. <HI>Plutarch</HI> de|&s;cribes one of his ve&s;&s;els, with forty benches of rowers,
<PB N="15" REF="15">
three hundred and &s;eventy-three feet long, and &s;ixty-four high at the poop. This enormous &s;hip, be&s;ide which our three-deckers would &s;eem &s;mall frigates, contained four hundred &s;ailors to work her, four thou|&s;and rowers, and about three thou&s;and fighting men. The arts of &s;hip-building and navigation, mu&s;t have been brought to great perfection among the Egyp|tians, who could build and work &s;uch immen&s;e ve&s;&s;els, that re&s;embled floating towns.</P>
<P>During the Alexandrian war, which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> XII. &s;u&s;tained again&s;t <HI>Coe&s;ar,</HI> the latter burnt a hundred and ten large &s;hips; and the Egyptians &s;till had re|&s;ources, enabling them to equip a fleet, capable of facing the enemy. But who could with&s;tand the genius of <HI>Coe&s;ar?</HI> To a woman, the glory of triumph|ing over this great man, was re&s;erved. <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> &s;ubjected the conqueror, by charms irre&s;i&s;tible. Du|ring the cour&s;e of her life, this queen di&s;played mag|nificence and prodigality, of which hi&s;tory contains not a &s;econd example. Cited by <HI>Anthony,</HI> then at Tar&s;us in Cecilia, to render an account of her conduct, &s;he went to meet the Roman General. Pa&s;&s;ing the Medi|terranean, &s;he &s;ailed up the Cydnus in a ve&s;&s;el; the de&s;cription of which re&s;embles what the poets give us of the &s;hell of <HI>Venus.</HI> The &s;ails were purple, the prow and &s;ides of glittering gold; and the oars, which kept time with the mu&s;ic, were plated with &s;ilver. The
<PB N="16" REF="16">
queen, reclining under her canopy, &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> en|riched with gold, and ine&s;timable gems, corre&s;ponded in dre&s;s to the &s;plendor of her &s;hip. The riche&s;t robes, bedecked with pearls and diamonds, veiled, but did not conceal her charms. Like the Cytherean god|de&s;s, round her were numerous children, habited like cupids, agitating the air this new deity breathed; while clouding perfumes, ince&s;&s;antly burnt, were waft|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the &s;hore. <HI>Anthony,</HI> intending to puni&s;h <HI>Cleo|patra,</HI> &s;oon felt the power of her beauty; and, for|getting the judge, became the lover. Yet, not to beauty alone was the Egyptian queen indebted for victory. She had wit, and a cultivated under&s;tanding; knew the Oriental languages, &s;poke the Greek, Ethio|pic, Hebrew, Parthian, Syriac, and Per&s;ian; and con|ver&s;ed in their own idioms with the various foreigners, who ince&s;&s;antly came to the port of Alexandria; that was then become the emporium of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra,</HI> had vanqui&s;hed <HI>Coe&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Anthony,</HI> but in vain attempted <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> a cold and artful man; and, fearing to be led in triumph by this powerful conqueror, &s;he killed her&s;elf. Egypt was then go|verned by the Romans; and was to Rome, what Peru has been to Spain, and Bengal is to England: &s;upply|ing Italy with gold and &s;ilver in &s;uch abundance, that provi&s;ions, merchandize, and lands, were doubled in value; thus ha&s;tening the ruin of the empire.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">In proportion as the Romans narrowed its limits, they adopted the vices and cu&s;toms of the conquered people. Egypt, was the kingdom that influenced their manners mo&s;t, becau&s;e it procured them mo&s;t wealth. Fine linens, and cotton cloths made at Alexandria &s;uperb carpets, and variegated cry&s;tals, were tran&s;|ported to Rome; while the abundant productions of the Thebais, &s;upplied the proud city with provi&s;ions. After this, &s;he had neither manufactures, nor agricul|ture; and, in a few years was &s;urrounded, like Eng|land, with immen&s;e parks, and by gardens; on the &s;pots, that dictators had ploughed and inhabited their ru&s;tic man&s;ions; delicious groves, ca&s;cades, parterres, and palaces were beheld. A&s;iatic effeminacy ener|vated the proud republicans. In vain did the wi&s;e&s;t of their emperors endeavour to re&s;i&s;t the torrent; nations paid them tribute. Egypt gave them corn, and they imagined they had only to receive the la|bours of the conquered, and the earth's homage. Its expiring ray freedom, extingui&s;hed by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> gave place to &s;lavery, and all its con&s;equent views. The Romans became le&s;s de&s;irous of commanding, than of enjoying, fe&s;tivals and &s;hows. The thir&s;t of gold completed corruption; all was venality at Rome; &s;oldiers and armies were bought, and the praetorian bands &s;et the empire to &s;ale.</P>
<P><PB REF="18">To Byzantium <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> tran&s;ported the &s;eat of empire, which &s;oon became divided, and its de&s;truc|tion followed. Egypt long was the tottering throne of Con&s;tantinople, and furni&s;hed its &s;overeign with re|&s;ources again&s;t its numerous enemies. The time, however, approached, when the glory of Egypt, to|gether with commerce, agriculture, and arts, was to decline.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a genius, equal to revolu|tions &s;o va&s;t, created a religion for the nations of Ara|bia, &s;cattered over the de&s;arts, which was to arm again&s;t the whole world. Hi&s;tory affords not an in&s;tance of another mi&s;&s;ion &s;o audacious. Death cut &s;hort his ex|ploits; but, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, animated by his example, and healed by the enthu&s;ia&s;m he had communicated, overthrew neighbouring nations, conquered Egypt, and a part of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Become a province under the califs, Egypt gradu|ally lo&s;t her commerce and arts. In her pre&s;ent &s;tate, groaning under the tyranny of the beys, &s;he cannot profit by her &s;ituation to rival the Europeans, who have di&s;covered new pa&s;&s;ages to that quarter of the globe, from whence &s;he drew her riche&s;t commodities. Her ignorant mariners, far from navigating the In|dian, &s;carcely dare venture over the Red Sea; their greate&s;t effort, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is their annual voyage to
<PB N="19" REF="19">
Moka, where there ill armed &s;aicks, incapable of de|fence, are laden with the coffee of Yemen; the mu&s;|lins and cloths of Bengal, brought them by the Ban|yans, the perfumes of Arabia, and the pearls of the i&s;les of Beharim. The coffee they buy for fourpence per pound, at Moka, they &s;ell for fifteen pence at Cairo; and this article alone amounts to half a mil|lion &s;terling.</P>
<P>Egypt, even in a decline, however, appears re|&s;pectable, becau&s;e &s;he contains within her&s;elf the true &s;ource of wealth. Her corn, with which &s;he &s;upplies Arabia, Syria, and a part of the Archipelago; her rice &s;ent over the Mediterranean; her carthamus flowers, with which the people of Provence annually load &s;everal &s;hips; her &s;al ammoniac, tran&s;ported through all Egypt; her abundant &s;ouda; her excel|lent flax, e&s;teemed by the Italians; her blue cloths, that cloath in part the neighbouring nations; all are objects that will make the balance of trade in her fa|vour. The Aby&s;&s;inians, bring her gold du&s;t, ele|phant's teeth, and other precious commodities, which they exchange for her productions. The cloths, lead, arms, and &s;ome gold lace from Lyons, which French &s;hips bring, do not equal what they receive; they pay the balance in Turki&s;h pia&s;tres. The merchandize, imported by the Turks, is far below what they take in return, and the difference is paid in ready money.
<PB N="20" REF="20">
Except Moka and Mecca, where the Egyptians leave a great part of their &s;equins, all who trade with them, bring &s;ilver and gold. So plentiful are the&s;e metals, that <HI>Ali</HI> bey flying to Syria, carried with him three millions and a half &s;terling; and <HI>I&s;mael</HI> bey, e&s;caping &s;ome years after, loaded fifty camels with &s;equins, pa|tacas, (a coin worth about five &s;hillings) pearls and jewellery.</P>
<P>If de&s;titute of &s;hipping and manufactures, Egypt is &s;till &s;o wealthy; what might &s;he not be, govern|ed by an enlightened people? What an influx of pro&s;perity would there ari&s;e from opening her canals, repairing her mounds, and re&s;toring to agricul|ture a third of the grounds, buried under the fands; what wealth, from opening her mines of emeralds, famous for almo&s;t equalling the diamond in dura|tion! With what utility might her indigo, carthamus, and other &s;ub&s;tances, excellent for dying, &s;cattered through her de&s;arts, be employed! The&s;e are not chi|merical riches; Egypt has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them for ages: and a wi&s;e admini&s;tration, would re&s;tore all the proli|fic trea&s;ures of nature.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s here, to give a more particular de&s;cription of the caravans, extracted from Major <HI>Rooke</HI>'s entertaining narrative, who cro&s;&s;ed the de&s;art with one, from Suez to Grand Cairo. A caravan,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
&s;ays he, &s;ignifies an a&s;&s;emblage of camels, hor&s;es, mules, men, and other animals, who are formed into large bodies, for the &s;ake of mutual protection; and, as they travel in &s;ome parts for two or three months together, over wa&s;te and barren de&s;arts, yielding nothing for the &s;upport of either man or bea&s;t, are obliged to take all nece&s;&s;aries with them, and parti|cularly water: it is on the&s;e occa&s;ions, that they find the &s;uperior excellence of the camel, to all other ani|mals; not only from its great &s;trength and unwearied per&s;everance, but from that property it has of &s;u&s;tain|ing thir&s;t for &s;everal days. The&s;e annual caravans, which go from Aleppo and Cairo to Mecca, are often compo&s;ed of thirty or forty thou&s;and people, and are under military government. An officer being ap|pointed by the Grand Signior, called the Emir Hagj, as we have before remarked, who conducts and com|mands them; the order of march, is regular and by ranks; the di&s;cipline is very exact; and a guard of Jani&s;&s;aries, with field-pieces, form the e&s;cort: they have regular times of marching and halting, which is done by &s;ignal. When they take up their ground for the night, tents are pitched; kitchens, cook&s;hops, and coffee-hou&s;es, are immediately erected, and a large camp is formed; every thing is as quickly packed up, and the camels are loaded in the morning, to be ready for gun-firing, which puts the whole body in motion. The caravan from Cairo, performs its journey to
<PB N="22" REF="22">
Mecca, in forty days; where, having &s;taid about a month, to celebrate the Hadji, a fe&s;tival, in which both the intere&s;ts of trade and religion are equally con&s;ulted, it returns in the &s;ame order, &s;topping at Medina in the way back, to pay a vi&s;it to, and make offerings at the &s;hrine of <HI>Mahommed,</HI> that having been the place of his interment, as Mecca was of his nati|vity.</P>
<P>The caravan from Suez to Cairo, being under no regulations, is an irregular and &s;traggling body, con|&s;i&s;ting of about one thou&s;and camels, and half as many men; we &s;et out, &s;ays he about noon, travelling on till eight at night; we then took up the ground; the camels ea&s;ed of their burthens, placed them&s;elves round their food, <HI>couchant,</HI> with their legs under them; and the men in the &s;ame order formed their me&s;&s;es: the cara|van was in motion by three the next morning, and travelled on without making one &s;ingle halt, even to give the camels water or food, till nine at night; &s;ome conjecture may from hence be formed, of the power of that animal; the pace we went at, &s;eemed to be nearly four miles an hour, and this was continued for eighteen hours together. My travelling carriage, was termed a <HI>Ku&s;hob.</HI> To compare &s;mall things with great, it re&s;embled the body of a coach, with an open|ing between the two &s;eats for the back of the camel, on which it was placed longitudinally, &s;o that one &s;eat
<PB N="23" REF="23">
hung on one &s;ide, the other on the other, and on each &s;its a per&s;on. I had a canopy over the top, in which I found &s;ingular u&s;e, as the heat of the &s;un was into|lerable; and, though I could not be conveyed in a manner more favourable to my feelings, lying along on mattra&s;&s;es, and pillows placed over the &s;eat; yet the unea&s;y motion of the camel, the heat of the wea|ther, and the exce&s;&s;ive drought I experienced, ren|dered it the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant journey I ever made.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Suez to Cairo is eighty miles, and is always a three day's journey for loaded camels; but our's not being loaded, they made the journey in little more than half the time. Having explained the mode of travelling, it will not require many words, to de&s;cribe a country uniformly barren, and &s;andy; &s;ome part of the way lay through a narrow valley, which appeared to be the bed of the canal, that was made to join the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and come into the latter at Suez; a great number of petrified branches of trees, and pieces of wood, are met with on the road, with here and there a carca&s;e, which is the vultures' prey; and, in &s;ome parts, a few &s;tunted &s;hrubs: every one, in the&s;e journies, goes armed, as the caravans are frequently attacked and plundered by the wild Arabs, who &s;trip the people, and leave them to peri&s;h on the de&s;art; a circum|&s;tance

that happened to &s;everal of our countrymen, a few years ago, in the following melancholy manner.</P>
<P>A contraband trade had, for &s;ome years, been car|ried on by the Engli&s;h people, from India to Cairo, much to their advantage, and as much to the prejudice of our commerce from thence to Europe: &s;everal &s;hips came annually to Suez, with cargoes from India; and though there was a firman of the Grand Signior, to whom the port belongs, &s;trictly forbidding all fo|reign &s;hips, or Chri&s;tians, to approach Suez; yet, as the pacha of Cairo, and the chief bey, found their in|tere&s;t in this illicit trade, they &s;uffered the firman to &s;leep, which it did, till a new pacha was &s;ent from Con&s;tantinople, with &s;trict orders to enforce it; where|on the following tragical event befel the Engli&s;hmen, when they came next to Suez, with their accu&s;tomed merchandize; not aware of this change of men and mea&s;ures at Cairo, they landed the cargoes of their &s;hips at Suez, paid the duties, and &s;et off. They tra|velled on the fir&s;t day with &s;ecurity, plea&s;ing them|&s;elves, probably, with the vi&s;ionary wealth which the goods were to produce, and little thinking how &s;ad a rever&s;e the next morning's light would occa&s;ion; &s;carce had they moved off the ground where they pa&s;&s;ed the night, when they were &s;urrounded by a large body of men, plundered, wounded, &s;tripped, and left naked in the de&s;art; the camels, with all their effects, water,

and provi&s;ions, being taken off by the robbers: in this piteous plight, they con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done, the only alternative being, whether they &s;hould return to Suez, or proceed to Cairo: they impru|dently re&s;olved on the latter, to which the di&s;tance was double that to Suez; to this place, two only of the company, wi&s;er than the re&s;t, made good their re|treat; the others went towards Cairo, at the in&s;tance of a commander of one of the &s;hips, who told them, that he knew the way acro&s;s the de&s;art, and that by going &s;traight to Cairo, and laying their ca&s;e before the government, they would &s;tand a better chance of recovering their goods; he gave the fir&s;t proof how bad his coun&s;el was, for being &s;oon &s;pent with heat and fatigue, he dropped and died. Being without their pilot, the re&s;t had but little chance of finding their way acro&s;s the de&s;art, where there is hardly a track; indeed, had they known it perfectly, it would have availed them little; naked, and expo&s;ed to the &s;corching beams of an African &s;un, in the month of Augu&s;t, without a drop of water to allay the raging thir&s;t they mu&s;t have experienced; all peri&s;hed ex|cept one, who arriving &s;pent and &s;peechle&s;s, at &s;ome Arabs huts, about a league from Cairo, the people there took a great deal of care of him, and partly re|covered him; he could &s;carcely articulate the name of the per&s;on to who&s;e hou&s;e he wi&s;hed to go; and when he arrived, he was &s;carcely known, &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed

was he with his &s;ufferings, which he did not get the better of in a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>The cruelty and weakne&s;s of a government, that inflicts puni&s;hment in the mi&s;erable manner above re|lated, is highly culpable; for &s;uch was the mode a|dopted by the pacha and bey, to put in force the fir|man of the Grand Signior; they them&s;elves, in fact, plundered the caravan, by means of their &s;oldiers, whom they &s;ent on this errand, and appropriated the &s;poil to their own u&s;e: they contrived likewi&s;e, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h &s;hips, by an artifice of the &s;ame dark nature, and impri&s;oned the crews. The go|vernment of Cairo, which, by openly &s;eizing the ef|fects of the people, who came there contrary to the orders of the Grand Signior, and contrary to the laws of their own country, would have acted properly, may ju&s;tly &s;tand taxed with the greate&s;t inhumanity for the conduct they ob&s;erved; and fearful that it might draw on them the re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h, who, with a &s;ingle frigate, could de&s;troy the whole of their trade in the Red Sea: they obliged all the Engli&s;hmen, who were then at Cairo, to bind them&s;elves, under the penalty of a con&s;iderable &s;um, that no &s;tep &s;hould be taken to revenge what had happened, making them find a merchant, who re&s;ided at Cairo, to be &s;urety for them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">No Chri&s;tian &s;hips have come to Suez &s;ince this af|fair; a frigate, with di&s;patches from India, came to Co&s;ire, about two years after; but the per&s;on charged with them, being contraband, was impri&s;oned by the pacha at Cairo, and &s;ent to Con&s;tantinople; for the firman not only forbids foreign &s;hips, and particularly Engli&s;h, from approaching the port of Suez, but all Chri&s;tians; declaring, "That the &s;ea of Suez, was de|&s;igned for the noble pilgrimage of Mecca; and, that the port thereof, is a port of two illu&s;trious cities, which are tho&s;e that make the light of the truth to &s;hine, and the law of the prophet; and are e&s;tabli&s;hed to promote religion and ju&s;tice, Mecca the enlighten|ed, and Medina the honoured; wherefore, it &s;ays, let &s;uch Chri&s;tians as come there, be impri&s;oned, and their effects confi&s;cated; and let no one endeavour to &s;et them free."</P>
<P>I little imagined, &s;ays <HI>Rooke,</HI> when I made tho&s;e ob|&s;ervations re&s;pecting the oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny of the Egyptian government; that I &s;hould, in my own per|&s;on, &s;o &s;oon give proof of what I have advanced; but, thus it happened, and the following adventure which I met with, may &s;erve to give a tolerable idea of its equity.</P>
<P>In one of my rides about the city, I was met by a party of Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, who acco&s;ting me, and &s;ome
<PB N="28" REF="29">
European friends who were of my party, &s;aid, that by order of their ma&s;ter, <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Bey, they were come in &s;earch of us, and that they mu&s;t immediately conduct us to him. We did not at all reli&s;h this &s;alutation, and would gladly have been excu&s;ed the honour of paying a vi&s;it to the Bey, but having no alternative, we proceeded quietly under their e&s;cort. We were not, it may be readily &s;uppo&s;ed, extremely comfort|able in this &s;ituation; and, in our way, endeavoured to divine the cau&s;e of it, but in vain: we found we had nothing el&s;e to do than to &s;ubmit patiently, and wait the event. Being arrived at the Bey's palace, my companions were &s;et at liberty, and I only detained; one of my friends, however, &s;tayed with me to act as interpreter, and plead my cau&s;e. We were now u&s;hered into the pre&s;ence-chamber, and found this potentate &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a carpet, &s;moaking a pipe &s;even or eight feet long; he was a middle aged man, rather corpulent, had a black and bu&s;hy beard that reached below his brea&s;t; and his countenance was hand&s;ome, although &s;tern and &s;evere; his myrmidons, who were bearded like him&s;elf, &s;tood in a circle round him, into the mid&s;t of which we were introduced.</P>
<P>The Bey, being informed that I was the per&s;on he had &s;ummoned, &s;urveyed me attentively; and, with an imperious tone of voice, pronounced my crime, and my &s;entence, in the &s;ame breath; telling me an

Armenian merchant having repre&s;ented to him, that an Engli&s;hman, who had pa&s;&s;ed through Cairo two years before, owed him a &s;um of money, his orders were, that I &s;hould immediately di&s;charge the debt in|curred by my countryman. I heard, with a&s;toni&s;hment, this extraordinary charge, and verdict; and, in reply, endeavoured to explain the hard&s;hip, and inju&s;tice of &s;uch a proceeding; telling him, that in the fir&s;t place, I doubted much whether the debt claimed by the Ar|menian was ju&s;t; and, in the &s;econd, &s;uppo&s;ing it was, I did not con&s;ider my&s;elf, by any means, bound to di&s;charge it; but all endeavours to exculpate my&s;elf, on the principles of rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, were totally u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince he &s;oon removed all my arguments by a &s;hort deci&s;ion; which was, that without further cere|mony, I mu&s;t either con&s;ent to pay the money, or re|main pri&s;oner in his ca&s;tle. I began then to enquire what the &s;um was, which the Armenian pretended to be due to him, and found it to be near five hundred pounds; at which price, high as it was, I believe I &s;hould have been induced to have purcha&s;ed my li|berty, had not my friend advi&s;ed me to the contrary, and given me hopes that it might be obtained without it; recommending me rather to &s;uffer a temporary confinement, than &s;ubmit to &s;o flagrant an extortion. Accordingly I prote&s;ted again&s;t paying the money, and was conducted, under a guard, into a room where I remained in arre&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">It was about noon, the u&s;ual time of dining in this country, and a very good pilau, with mutton, was &s;erved up to me; in &s;hort, I was very civily treated in my confinement, but &s;till it was a confinement; and, as &s;uch, could not fail of being extremely unplea|&s;ant; my only hopes were founded in the good offices of an Italian merchant, who&s;e &s;ervices to me, and many of my countrymen, who had been embroiled in affairs of the like nature here, de&s;erve our warme&s;t gratitude.</P>
<P>My apartment was plea&s;antly &s;ituated, with a fine view of the Nile, and a rich country; but I &s;hould have enjoyed the pro&s;pect much more, upon another occa&s;ion. On a kind of lawn, &s;haded with trees, in front of the ca&s;tle, two or three hundred hor&s;es &s;tood at picquet, richly capari&s;oned, belonging to the Bey and his guards. His principal officers and &s;laves came to vi&s;it me; and, in talking over my ca&s;e, they agreed it was very hard; but, to comfort me, &s;aid that their ma&s;ter was a very good prince, and would not keep me long confined.

While he was pro|ceeding in his endeavours to bring me over to his faith, two officers came from <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> the chief Bey, to procure my relea&s;e. My worthy friend, the Italian merchant, having very good intere&s;t with him, had made application in my behalf, and, in con&s;equence, the&s;e two amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent to reque&s;t that <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha</HI> Bey would deliver me up to them; but he &s;eemed by no means inclinable &s;o to do; and, re&s;uming his former &s;ternne&s;s of look, remained for &s;ome time in|exorable; till at length, wrought on by their en|treaties, he con&s;ented to let me go, ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, whenever he had an opportunity of making a little money, <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Bey always interfered, and pre|vented him: a pretty ob&s;ervation! From which may be inferred, that they look upon <HI>us</HI> as fair plunder;

Our readers may form an idea of all, when we mention one of a gentleman, who pa&s;&s;ing by Suez, in his way to England, that he might not be de|tained there, by the &s;earching of his baggage, pre|vailed on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers to di&s;pen&s;e with it, and only put their &s;eals on his trunks, to exempt them from being vi&s;ited till his arrival at Cairo; where being come, fatigued with his journey, and impatient to &s;hift him&s;elf, he would not wait for the in&s;pection of the officers, but broke the &s;eals to get his clothes, and paid a thou&s;and pounds for the luxury of a clean &s;hirt, an hour before he otherwi&s;e would have had it.</P>
<P>When I hear, &s;ays <HI>Rooke,</HI> of the heavy fines that have been levied on my countrymen, in their pa&s;&s;age through Egypt, I con&s;ider my&s;elf happy in being quit for a confinement of only a few hours, and fifty pounds

<P>From <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Bey's palace, I was conducted to that of the chief Bey, being attended by an officer of the former, who was &s;ent with me; <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was &s;itting in a &s;mall apartment, richly furni&s;h|ed, &s;moaking his pipe, and was accompanied by two other Turks; he appeared to be between forty and fifty years of age, middle &s;ized and hand&s;ome; and is reckoned a man of ability. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Bey's officer, inveighing &s;everely again&s;t the conduct of his ma&s;ter; then, turning to me, &s;aid I might depend on his protection, during the remainder of my &s;tay in that country; and, finding my purpo&s;e was to go down the Nile, and to Alex|andria, he gave me a pa&s;&s;port to exempt me from any trouble, or mole&s;tation I might receive on my pa&s;&s;age. Having made my proper acknowledgments to this prince for his civilities, I retired, not a little rejoiced, to have regained my liberty.</P>
<P>Owing to this kind of rapine and extortion, prac|ti&s;ed by the&s;e potentates, and likewi&s;e to the firman of the Grand Signior forbidding European &s;hips to ap|proach the port of Suez; this channel of communi|cation, betwixt Europe and India, has been &s;hut for &s;ome years pa&s;t; a circum&s;tance extremely detri|mental

<P>THE Egyptians are certainly a very ancient na|tion, though far from being &s;o ancient as they pretend, when they give us a catalogue of princes, who, according to their account, mu&s;t have exi&s;ted &s;everal thou&s;and years before the creation; but, as it has been &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome writers, if the Egyptians, by years, intended only periodical revolutions of the moon, and not of the &s;un, their difference of reckon|ing may be more ea&s;ily reconciled. Be&s;ides, it has been long ob&s;erved, of the Chine&s;e, and other king|doms who remount their origin &s;o very high, that they give no authentic account of the&s;e pretended an|cient times, but refer the fir&s;t ri&s;e, of all arts and &s;ci|ences, to the &s;ame date with our&s;elves.</P>

In the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kings of Per&s;ia it continued till the time of <HI>Darius,</HI> when it was taken from them by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. At his death the province of Egypt fell to the &s;hare of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;or, ever after retained that name. In this line it continued till the famous <HI>Cleo|patra</HI> a&s;cended the throne, the wife and &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Pto|lemy Diony&s;ius,</HI> the la&s;t king. After the death of <HI>Cleo|patra,</HI> who had been mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> Egypt became a Roman pro|vince for near &s;even hundred years, when the Sara|cens took it in 640. The famous library of Alexan|dria, &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted of 700,000 volumes, was collected by <HI>Ptolemy Philadelphus,</HI> &s;on of the fir&s;t <HI>Pto|lemy,</HI> and the &s;ame prince cau&s;ed the old te&s;tament to be tran&s;lated into Greek; this tran&s;lation is known by the name of the Septuagint ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the Cru&s;ades, in the twelfth century, Egypt was governed by <HI>Noreddin,</HI> who&s;e &s;on, the famous <HI>Sa|ladin,</HI> was &s;o dreadful to the chri&s;tian adventurers, and retook from them Jeru&s;alem. This prince in&s;tituted the military corps of Mamluks, who &s;oon after ma&s;|&s;acred the de&s;cendants of <HI>Saladin,</HI> and u&s;urped the go|vernment into their own hands. The&s;e Mamluks
<PB N="37" REF="38">
changed the form of government into a republic. They elected, however, a chief, in whom they con|&s;ided great authority. Egypt continued in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion till 1517, when Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> made a conque&s;t of the country, and it has ever &s;ince been tributary to the Turks.</P>
<P>But before we &s;peak of the pre&s;ent government in Egypt, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome clear and preci&s;e idea of the Mamluks. This appellation is be&s;towed on children, who, carried off by merchants, or banditti from Georgia, Circa&s;&s;ia, Natolia, and the various provinces of the Ottoman empire, are after|wards &s;old in Con&s;tantinople and Grand Cairo. The grandees of Egypt, who have a &s;imilar origin, bring them up in their hou&s;es, and de&s;tine them to &s;ucceed to their dignities. The&s;e foreigners, at pre&s;ent, can alone enjoy the title of Bey, and fill the offices of &s;tate. The law is &s;o preci&s;e, that even the &s;on of a Bey cannot be rai&s;ed to this eminent &s;tation; he, therefore, u&s;ually embraces the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. The divan a&s;&s;igns him a proper maintenance, and names him &s;on of the country.</P>
<P>The Mamluks are, mo&s;t of them, born of chri&s;tian parents; but are forced to embrace Mahometani&s;m, and &s;uffer circumci&s;ion. They have an excellent edu|cation given them, &s;o that they may be capable of ex|erci&s;ing
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the offices they are to fill. They ri&s;e u&s;ually by their merit, through the various tru&s;ts in the hou&s;e of the Beys, till they arrive at the po&s;t of Ca|chef, or Lieutenant of the Beys; when they govern the towns dependent on their patrons; at which time they are permitted to buy Mamluks, who follow their fortune, and become their companions and in&s;tru|ments. Their next ri&s;e is to the dignity of Bey, which gives them a &s;eat among the four and twenty members of the Divan, or council of the republic.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing them &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this country for &s;everal centuries, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> we &s;hould be led to imagine their race is pre&s;erved by the ordinary means; but, if their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment was a &s;ingular event, their con|tinuation is not le&s;s extraordinary. During five hun|dred and fifty years that there have been monarchs in Egypt, not one of them has left &s;ub&s;i&s;ting i&s;&s;ue; there does not exi&s;t one &s;ingle family of them in the &s;econd generation; all their children peri&s;h in the fir&s;t, or &s;econd de&s;cent. Almo&s;t the &s;ame thing happens to the Turks; and, it is ob&s;erved, they can only &s;ecure the continuance of their families by marrying women who are natives, which the Mamluks have always di&s;dained.</P>
<P>The wives of the Mamluks are like them, &s;laves brought from Georgia, Mongrelia, &amp;c. Their beauty
<PB N="39" REF="40">
is a con&s;tant topic among us, and we mu&s;t believe it on the credit of fame. But a European, &s;ays <HI>Vol|ney,</HI> who has only been in Turkey, has no right to give his te&s;timony on the &s;ubject. The&s;e women are more invi&s;ible here than the others; and to this circum&s;tance their reputation for beauty is greatly owing. A lady, wife of one of the French merchants at Cairo, who, by dealing in laces and Lyons' &s;tuffs, had acce&s;s to all the harems, a&s;&s;ured me, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> that among a thou&s;and, or twelve hundred cho&s;en wo|men, &s;he had &s;een, &s;he had not found ten real beauties. But the Turks are not difficult; provided a woman be fair, &s;he is hand&s;ome; and if &s;he be fat, &s;he is en|chanting; "her countenance is like the full moon, her haunches are like cu&s;hions," &s;ay they, to expre&s;s the &s;uperlative of beauty. They may be &s;aid to mea|&s;ure them by the quintal. They have be&s;ides a pro|verb worthy the notice of naturali&s;ts; "Take a fair female for thy eyes, but for plea&s;ure an Egyptian."</P>
<P>Let the naturali&s;t explain why men well formed, and married to healthy women, are unable to natu|ralize on the banks of the Nile, a race born at the foot of mount Cauca&s;us; And let it be remembered, at the &s;ame time, that the plants of Europe in that country are equally unable to continue their &s;pecies! Some may refu&s;e to believe this extraordinary fact, but it is no le&s;s certain, nor does it appear to be new.
<PB N="40" REF="41">
The ancients have made ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame na|ture; thus when <HI>Hippocrates</HI> a&s;&s;erts that, among the Scythians and Egyptians, all the individuals re&s;emble each other, though they are like no other nations; when he adds that in the countries, inhabited by the&s;e two races of men, the climate, &s;ea&s;ons, aliments and &s;oil, po&s;&s;e&s;s a uniformity no where el&s;e to be found, does he not recogni&s;e that kind of exclu&s;ion? When &s;uch countries impre&s;s &s;o peculiar a character on every thing native, is it not a rea&s;on why they &s;hould reject whatever is foreign? It &s;eems then, that the only means of naturalizing animals and plants, would be to contract an affinity with the climate, by alliance with the native &s;pecies; and this the Mamluks have con&s;tantly refu&s;ed. The means, therefore, by which they are perpetuated and multiplied, are the &s;ame by which they were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; that is to &s;ay, when they die, they are replaced by &s;laves brought from their original country.</P>
<P>Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> having conquered Egypt, and defeated the Mamluks, cau&s;ed their king to be hanged at the gates of Cairo. This barbarous action, di&s;gu&s;ted them &s;o much, that they only waited his departure again to take up arms. Reflecting afterwards on his error, that he might gain their good-will, he granted them very peculiar privileges, &s;pecified in a treaty, and made very little change in their form of government.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">The four and twenty Beys were to govern as be|fore; except, that a ba&s;haw from the Porte was to re|&s;ide at Grand Cairo, with whom it was required they &s;hould deliberate, from time to time, on the &s;tate of public affairs; but if he attempted to infringe their privileges, they might &s;u&s;pend him. They were like|wi&s;e to furni&s;h a &s;tipulated body of troops to the Ot|toman court, if it were attacked; and further, to pay a certain tribute; but, in other re&s;pects, they were left entirely to their own government.</P>
<P>The Beys feel the power they po&s;&s;e&s;s, which they dreadfully abu&s;e. The pacha remains no longer than while he is &s;ub&s;ervient to their de&s;igns; &s;hould he dare to &s;peak in defence of his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts, or tho&s;e of the Egyptians, he becomes a &s;tate-criminal: the divan a&s;&s;embles, and he is expelled. The follow|ing is the manner in which they receive and eject tho&s;e repre&s;entatives of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>When a new pacha lands at Alexandria, he gives notice of his arrival to the council of the republic; &s;ome of the Beys, of mo&s;t addre&s;s, are then &s;ent to compliment him, bring him pre&s;ents, and profe&s;s great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. While they attend on him, they artfully &s;ound his inclinations, and endeavour to learn from his own mouth, or that of his officers, what are the orders he brings. Should they find them inimical to
<PB N="42" REF="43">
their own purpo&s;es, they expedite a courier to the chief Bey, who a&s;&s;embles the divan, and the pacha is forbidden to proceed further. They then write to the Grand Signior, that the new governor comes with ho&s;tile intentions, and &s;uch as will excite rebellion among his faithful &s;ubjects; and reque&s;t his recall, which is &s;ure to be complied with. When the chiefs of the republic believe they have nothing to fear from the pacha, they invite him to Grand Cairo; the de|puties place him in a &s;umptuous galley, and e&s;cort him all the way. The attendant boats are elegantly tilted, and filled with mu&s;icians. He advances &s;lowly at the head of the fleet; no ve&s;&s;el being allowed to pa&s;s that of the pacha. Tho&s;e, who are unfortunately making a voyage up the Nile, are obliged to fol|low in his &s;uite. He &s;tops at Helai, a &s;mall village below Boulac, where the Sheik El Balad, <HI>i. e.</HI> chief Bey, comes him&s;elf to receive him, or deputes &s;everal fangiacs. The heads of the republic again congratu|late him on his landing; the Aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries pre&s;ents him the keys of the ca&s;tle, prays him to make it his re&s;idence, and he is conducted in pomp through the city. I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> and therefore can de&s;cribe, the entrance of a pacha.</P>
<P>The various corps of infantry, with their noi&s;y mu|&s;ic, march fir&s;t in two files, their colours waving; the cavalry follow. About five or &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e|men
<PB N="43" REF="44">
advance in good order, their clothing made of very bright &s;tuffs, while their floating robes, enormous mu&s;tachoes, and long lances of &s;hining &s;teel, give them a maje&s;tic and warlike appearance. Then come the Beys, magnificently clothed, and attended by their Mamluks, mounted on Arabian hor&s;es, highly mettled, and adorned with hou&s;ings, embroidered in gold and &s;ilver; the bridles of tho&s;e of the chiefs are bedecked with fine pearls and precious &s;tones, and their &s;addles with glittering gold. The various retinues of each Bey were very elegant; the beauty of the youth, the richne&s;s of their dre&s;s, and their excellent hor&s;eman|&s;hip, all together formed a very agreeable &s;ight. The pacha clo&s;ed the march, advancing gravely, preceded by two hundred hor&s;emen, a band of mu&s;ic, and four led hor&s;es, &s;lowly guided by &s;laves on foot, covered with hou&s;ings, mo&s;t richly embroidered in gold and pearls, thrt trailed on the ground. The pacha, mount|ed on a beauteous barb, wore a clu&s;ter of large dia|monds in his turban, which darted back the &s;un's rays. This proce&s;&s;ion may convey &s;ome idea of the oriental pomp and magnificence of the ancient mo|narchs of A&s;ia, when they &s;hewed them&s;elves in pub|lic. It began about eight and la&s;ted till noon.</P>
<P>On the morrow the pacha a&s;&s;embled the divan, and invited the beys to be pre&s;ent: he &s;at on a rai&s;ed &s;eat with a barred window, like the Grand Signior.
<PB N="44" REF="45">
His Kiaya, or lieutenant, read the orders of the Porte, and the &s;angines, profoundedly bowing, promi&s;ed obe|dience in all things which &s;hould not infringe their rights This ended, a collation was &s;erved; and, when the a&s;&s;embly ro&s;e, the pacha pre&s;ented the Sheik El Balad with a rich furred robe, and a hor&s;e magni|ficently capari&s;oned; al&s;o caftans to the other Beys. Such is the ceremony of in&s;tallation for a pacha.</P>
<P>His office is a kind of bani&s;hment; he cannot leave his palace, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the Sheik El Ba|lad, but is a &s;tate-pri&s;oner; who, in the mid&s;t of &s;plen|dor, cannot avoid feeling the weight of his chains. His revenue amounts to near 125,000l. and is rai&s;ed from the duties paid at Suez, on the merchandize of the Red Sea.</P>
<P>The ambition of the Beys pre&s;ents him with an abundant &s;ource of wealth; when, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing political cunning, and a knowledge of his own means, he has the art to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention among the chiefs, and form parties. Each will exert their endeavours to obtain his intere&s;t, and wealth will pour in upon him. The &s;angiacs, named by the divan al&s;o, purcha&s;e a confir|mation of their dignity from the pacha; and the inhe|ritance of tho&s;e who die without i&s;&s;ue appertains to him.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">Thus may the Grand Signior's repre&s;entative main|tain him&s;elf in office, and become immen&s;ely rich, pro|vided he proceeds with circum&s;pection; for the ground on which he &s;tands is &s;o &s;lippery, that the lea&s;t wrong &s;tep occa&s;ions his fall; and &s;ome unfore&s;een circum|&s;tances will often counteract his utmo&s;t policy. Should &s;ome young, audacious &s;angiac vanqui&s;h the party, favoured by the pacha, and arrive at the dignity of Sheik El Balad, he a&s;&s;embles the council, and the go|vernor is ignominiou&s;ly expelled. His order to de|part is entru&s;ted to an officer cloathed in black; who, carrying it in his bo&s;om, advances into the audience chamber; and, taking up a corner of the carpet which covers the &s;ofa, bows profoundedly, and &s;ays <HI>In&s;el Pacha, i. e. come down Pacha;</HI> which, having &s;aid, he departs. The governor is immediately obliged to pack up and retire, in the &s;pace of four-and-twenty hours, to Boulac, where he waits for orders from Con&s;tantinople. His per&s;on is generally &s;afe; but, &s;hould the prevailing Beys have complaints again&s;t him, they make him render a &s;evere account of his ad|mini&s;tration, and the pre&s;ents he has received; after which they divide the &s;poil. The council of the re|public elects a Caimakan, during the interregnum, to &s;upply his place, till the arrival of a new pacha.</P>
<P>An attempt was made, a few years &s;ince, to deprive the Ottoman Porte of its authority over Egypt, by
<PB N="46" REF="47">
<HI>Ali</HI> Bey, who&s;e father was a Greek prie&s;t, of one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed families of the country. Hav|ing turned Mahometan, and being a man of abilities and addre&s;s, he rendered him&s;elf extremely popular in Egypt. A fal&s;e accu&s;ation having been made a|gain&s;t him, &s;oon after he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of Bey, orders were &s;ent from Con&s;tantinople to take off his head. Being apprized of the de&s;ign, he had the me&s;&s;enger put to death, who brought the order, and &s;oon found means to put him&s;elf at the head of an army; and, being al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the dangerous &s;itua|tion to which the Turki&s;h empire was reduced, in con&s;equence of the war with Ru&s;&s;ia, he boldly mount|ed the throne of the ancient &s;ultans of Egypt. But not content with this, he al&s;o laid claim to Syria, Pa|le&s;tine, and that part of Arabia which belonged to them.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of his a&s;&s;uming the &s;overeignty of Egypt is related by <HI>Savary</HI> as follows. In 1768, the Ru&s;&s;ians declared war again&s;t the Turks, and &s;ent their fleets into the Mediterranean. <HI>Ali,</HI> who was Sheik El Balad, according to the ancient &s;tipulation, when the country was conquered from the Mamluks, rai&s;ed twelve thou&s;and men to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Porte, which cir|cum&s;tance his enemies endeavoured to turn to his de&s;truction. They wrote to the divan, that the troops he had a&s;&s;embled were to &s;erve in the Ru&s;&s;ian armies,
<PB N="47" REF="48">
with whom he had entered into an alliance, and the latter was &s;igned by &s;everal of the Beys. The ca|lumny was credited, and a Capigi-bachi immediately &s;ent, with four attendants, for the head of <HI>Ali.</HI> Hap|pily for him he had a faithful agent in the council, who in&s;tantly &s;ent off two couriers, the one by land, the other by &s;ea, to adverti&s;e him of the treachery. They out&s;tripped the me&s;&s;engers of the Grand Signior, and <HI>Ali</HI> &s;ent for <HI>Tentaoui,</HI> one of his confidents, informed him of the &s;ecret, ordered him to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;gui&s;e of an Arab, and, with twelve Mamluks, wait the arri|val of the me&s;&s;engers from Con&s;tantinople twenty miles from Cairo, &s;eize their di&s;patches, and put them to death. <HI>Tentaoui</HI> performed his mi&s;&s;ion: having waited &s;ome time at the appointed place, he &s;aw the Capigi-bachi and his attendants approach, &s;eized them, and their fatal order, murdered them, and buried their bodies in the &s;and.</P>
<P>Having the firman in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>Ali</HI> a&s;&s;embled the Beys, and after reading it to them, addre&s;&s;ed them in the following animated &s;peech: "How much lon|ger, &s;ays he, &s;hall we be the victims of Ottoman de&s;|poti&s;m? What faith can we put in the treaites of the Porte? Not many years &s;ince, &s;everal of the Beys were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, contrary to all ju&s;tice; &s;ome of you were pre&s;ent, and bear about with you the marks of that ma&s;&s;acre. The marble we tread is red with the
<PB N="48" REF="49">
blood of four of your colleagues. To day I am to die, and to-morrow, the man who &s;hall &s;upply my place. The hour is come for us to &s;hake off this ty|rant's yoke; who, violating our privileges and laws, di&s;pen&s;es with our lives at his plea&s;ure. Let us unite our&s;elves with Ru&s;&s;ia, and free the republic from the dominions of a barbarous ma&s;ter. Grant me your aid, and I will be re&s;pon&s;ible for the liberty of Egypt."</P>
<P>This produced its wi&s;hed for effect. Sixteen Beys, who were of <HI>Ali</HI>'s party, unanimou&s;ly declared for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> on the Grand Signior; and the re&s;t, un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> oppo&s;e, promi&s;ed every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power The pacha was ordered to quit Egypt in four and twenty hours, and the &s;tandard of independence was immediately rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Ali</HI> was engaged in &s;ubduing the neighbour|ing provinces of Arabia and Syria, he was no le&s;s at|tentive to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a regular form of go|vernment, and introducing order into a country that had long been the &s;eat of anarchy and confu&s;ion. His views were equally extended to commerce, for which purpo&s;e he gave great encouragement to merchants, and aboli&s;hed &s;ome &s;candalous re&s;traints and indigni|ties to which they were before expo&s;ed. His great de&s;ign, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, was to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Red Sea; to make Suez a free port, particularly
<PB N="49" REF="50">
for the Europeans, and to make Egypt once more the great centre of commerce. The conduct and views of <HI>Ali</HI> &s;hewed an extent of thought and ability; and be&s;poke a mind equal to the founding of an empire, but he was not finally &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Though at the &s;ummit of grandeur, <HI>Ali</HI> forgot not his parents. Having made his peace with the Porte, he ordered one of his generals, who was going into Natolia to bring back his father and family. Hear|ing of their arrival at Boulac, he went to meet them with a numerous train; and, as &s;oon as he perceived the aged <HI>Daoud</HI> he de&s;cended from his hor&s;e, ran and fell on his knees, and ki&s;&s;ed his feet. The father wept with joy; it was the happie&s;t day of his life, and <HI>Ali</HI> embraced his &s;i&s;ter and nephew. This tender &s;cene over, he conducted them to his palace, and the Mamluks contended who &s;hould wa&s;h the feet of their ma&s;ter's father. When they had cloathed him in magnificent robes, he was led into the harem, and re|ceived the mo&s;t affectionate care&s;&s;es from the wife of <HI>Ali. Daoud,</HI> mounted on a fine hor&s;e, was conducted to the hall of the divan; the beys, and even the pa|cha, complimented and made him pre&s;ents. After re|maining &s;even months in Egypt, he wi&s;hed to return to his native country, whither <HI>Ali</HI> &s;ent him, on board a ve&s;&s;el loaded with riches. Incidents like the&s;e, which have a great re&s;emblance to the hi&s;tory of
<PB N="50" REF="51">
<HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> when he went to meet his father in Go&s;hen, are often renewed in Egypt. <HI>Ali</HI>'s wife was a female &s;lave from Red Ru&s;&s;ia, who was very beautiful; her flaxen hair reached to the ground; her figure was tall and noble; her complexion of the pure&s;t white; her eyes blue, and her eye-brows black; but the&s;e were the lea&s;t of the trea&s;ures which nature had be&s;towed on the youthful <HI>Maria;</HI> her mind was &s;uperior to her form. Her unhappy fate never could make her conde&s;cend to gratify the de&s;ires of her ma&s;ter; he &s;poke of his power; &s;he &s;hewed &s;he was free, though in chains; he wi&s;hed to dazzle by his &s;plendor, but &s;he was in&s;en|&s;ible to pomp and grandeur. Charmed with a haugh|tine&s;s &s;o congenial to his nature, he became her lover and offered her his hand, if &s;he would renounce chri&s;|tianity; but, though not without affection for a man who had treated her according to her de&s;erts, &s;he &s;till had the fortitude to refu&s;e. At la&s;t he permitted her to retain her religion, provided &s;he would not profe&s;s it publickly, and obtained her con&s;ent; and &s;o great was his love for her, that he never had any other wife. <HI>Ali</HI> was, for a long time, very fortunate in all his enterprizes again&s;t the neighbouring A&s;iatic pa|chas, whom he repeatedly defeated; but was after|wards deprived of the kingdom of Egypt, by the ba&s;e and ungrateful conduct of <HI>Abou Dahab,</HI> who had long meditated his ruin. This was a &s;lave for whom <HI>Ali</HI> had a particular affection. He had rai&s;ed him to the
<PB N="51" REF="52">
dignity of Bey; and to give him a &s;till further proof of his affection, gave him afterwards his &s;i&s;ter in marriage. A&s;piring, however, to the &s;overeign power, he thought no means unju&s;t by which he might rid him&s;elf of his patron. The Beys of his faction, knowing his ava|rice, gave him con&s;iderable &s;ums to rid them of <HI>Ali;</HI> but he, con&s;cious of his brother's vigilance, the love of his adherents, and the difficulties of his enterprize, kept the gold, and waited a more favourable oppor|tunity; but to ingratiate him&s;elf, and blind his friend &s;till farther, he di&s;covered the con&s;piracy. The con|&s;equences exceeded his expectations, and the affec|tions of <HI>Ali,</HI> for the man to whom he thought he owed his life, became exce&s;&s;ive. <HI>Abou Dahab,</HI> how|ever, never lo&s;t &s;ight of his dete&s;table intents, but en|deavoured to &s;educe <HI>Tentaoui,</HI> and offered him twelve thou&s;and guineas, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his patron, when they were playing at che&s;s. <HI>Tentaoui</HI> immediately in|formed <HI>Ali</HI> of the propo&s;al, at which &s;o much was he prejudiced in his favour, that he did but laugh. Fail|ing in this project, he tried another, and wi&s;hed to force a wife to poi&s;on a brother &s;he loved, in a cup of coffee. She rejected the propo&s;al with horror, and &s;ent his faithful &s;lave to conjure <HI>Ali</HI> to keep on his guard again&s;t <HI>Abou,</HI> as his mo&s;t dangerous enemy. So many warnings ought to have rendered him &s;u&s;pici|ous, but his affection was extreme; nor could he
<PB N="52" REF="53">

<P>The treachery of this villain, and of another of his generals, <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> whom he had entru&s;ted with the com|mand of his troops, and who went over to <HI>Abou,</HI> preyed upon his mind; he &s;huddered at the very name of <HI>Abou Dahab,</HI> and his blood boiled in his veins. Being obliged in con&s;equence, to fly Egypt, he retreated to the dominions of Sheik <HI>Daher,</HI> at Acre, where he collected an army to make head again&s;t <HI>Abou.</HI> This agitation, and the fatigue of a painful march, occa&s;ioned him to fall dangerou&s;ly ill. When he came in &s;ight of <HI>Abou Dahab</HI>'s army, he arranged his troops in order of battle, and ordered him&s;elf to be carried into his tent, for he was too weak to &s;it on hor&s;eback. Victory had declared for <HI>Ali,</HI> when the Mograbians, mercenary troops&punc; who fight only for the lu&s;t of gain, &s;educed by the magnificent promi&s;es of <HI>Abou,</HI> went over to his &s;ide, and the face of fortune was changed. The flying rallied; and, having now only a &s;mall army to encounter, &s;urrounded them on all &s;ides, and made great &s;laughter. His friends then rode up to his tent, and conjured him to fly to Acre. <HI>Ali</HI> an&s;wered, fly my friends, I command you; as for me, my hour is come. Scarcely had they quitted him, before the lieutenant of <HI>Abou,</HI> entering, &s;abre in hand, <HI>Ali</HI> firing his pi&s;tol, ended him. Bathed in his blood,
<PB N="53" REF="54">
for two &s;oldiers had before wounded him, he fought like a lion; when another from behind bringing him down with his &s;abre, they fell upon him, and carried him to the tent of the victor. The traitor, perfidious to the la&s;t, &s;hed feigned tears, at beholding him thus, and endeavoured to con&s;ole him. <HI>Ali</HI> turned away his eyes and &s;pake not a word. He died a week after of his wounds; though &s;ome &s;aid he was poi&s;oned by his infamous brother-in-law; if &s;o, this was the com|pletion of his atrocious acts; nor can we reflect, with|out &s;huddering on the horrors which ambition impels men to commit.</P>
<P><HI>Ali</HI> was above the middle &s;ize; his eyes were large and full of fire, his manner was noble and winning, and his character frank and generous. Nature had endowed him with unconquerable fortitude, and an elevated genius. He fell the victim of friend&s;hip, and his misfortunes were the con&s;equence of having nurtured a traitor, who profited by his benefactions to embitter and rob him of life. Had Ru&s;&s;ia accepted the offers he made her, and granted him engineers, with three or four thou&s;and men, he would have &s;ub|dued Syria and Egypt, and yielded the commerce of Arabia and India into the hands of his ally. He peri&s;hed at the age of forty-five. The Egyptians wept his death, and &s;aw them&s;elves again the victims of mi&s;eries, from which he had delivered them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of their Antiquities.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we quit Egypt, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of the monuments that are mo&s;t worthy of the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e who travel into this country; we mean tho&s;e pyramids, that have been ranked formerly in the number of the &s;even wonders of the world, that are admired &s;till, and that extend from Cairo to Meduun.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uperb monuments are found only in Egypt; for though there is one at Rome, which &s;erves for a tomb to <HI>C. Ce&s;tius,</HI> it can be con&s;idered only as a mere imitation; and the lea&s;t of tho&s;e in Egypt &s;urpa&s;&s;es it much in grandeur. Thus it does not hinder us from
<PB N="55" REF="56">
being able to a&s;&s;ert, that pyramids are found only in Egypt.</P>
<P>Another general po&s;ition is, that we &s;ee pyramids only between Cairo and Meduun. Some, indeed, have advanced that there were pyramids in Upper Egypt; but they have been deceived, &s;ays <HI>Norden,</HI> by fal&s;e memoirs, or they were willing out of vain glory, to have &s;uppo&s;ed to have penetrated places where no one el&s;e has been, and to have &s;een what no one has &s;ince di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The pyramids are not &s;ituated in plains, as is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed; but, upon the rock, that is at the foot of the high mountains, which accompany the Nile in its cour&s;e, and which make the &s;eparation between Egypt and Libya. They have been all rai&s;ed with with the &s;ame intention, that is, to &s;erve for &s;epul|chres; but their architecture is extremely different, with regard to the di&s;tribution, the materials, and the grandeur.</P>
<P>Some are open; others ruined; and the greate&s;t part of them are clo&s;ed; but there is none of them which has not been damaged in &s;ome of its parts.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily conceived that they could not have been all rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time. The prodigious
<PB N="56" REF="57">
quantity of materials, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to collect, renders the &s;uppo&s;ition extremely improbable. The perfection, with which the la&s;t are built, &s;hews it in like manner, as they &s;urpa&s;s the fir&s;t, very much, in grandeur and magnificence. All that can be ad|vanced for certain is, that their fabric is of the mo&s;t remote antiquity, and even more early than the times of the mo&s;t ancient hi&s;torians, who&s;e writings have been handed down to us. That which the&s;e authors a&s;&s;ert, of the time of the building of the pyramids, is founded on traditions more fabulous than probable. It is a thing as wonderful as it is certain, that they &s;ub&s;i&s;t to our time; though the epoch of their foun|dation was lo&s;t, even at the time that the fir&s;t Greek philo&s;ophers travelled into Egypt.</P>
<P>If any one &s;hould think of maintaining, that the mo&s;t ancient pyramids mu&s;t have been founded at the &s;ame time as the tower of Babel, the notion would be thought a little extravagant. But the pyramids would, at lea&s;t, have this advantage, that they &s;ub&s;i&s;t at pre&s;ent; but there remain &s;carce any foot&s;teps of that ancient tower.</P>
<P>It appears probable, &s;ays <HI>Norden,</HI> that the origin of the pyramids even preceded that of the hieroglyphics. And as they had no longer the knowledge of tho&s;e characters, at the time when the Per&s;ians made the con|que&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="58">
of Egypt, we mu&s;t throw back the fir&s;t epoch of the pyramids, into times &s;o remote in antiquity, that vulgar chronology would find it difficult to fix the aera of their date.</P>
<P>If we conjecture that the pyramids, even the late&s;t, have been rai&s;ed before they had the u&s;e of hierogly|phics, we do not make the a&s;&s;ertion without &s;ome grounds to go upon. Who can per&s;uade him&s;elf that the Egyptians would have left &s;uch &s;uperb monuments, without the lea&s;t hieroglyphic in&s;cription&mdash;They who were profu&s;e of hieroglyphics, upon all edifices of any importance? Now there are none to be perceived, either in the in&s;ide, or out&s;ide of the pyramids, nor even on the ruins of the temple of the &s;econd and third pyramid. Is not this a proof, that the origin of the pyramids is antecedent to that of the hierogly|phics, which are, however, con&s;idered as the fir&s;t cha|racters u&s;ed in Egypt.</P>
<P>There runs among the people in Egypt, a tradition, that there were anciently in this country giants; and that they rai&s;ed without much difficulty, the pyramids, temples, and va&s;t palaces, who&s;e remains occa&s;ion at pre&s;ent, our admiration.</P>
<P>This fable &s;carces de&s;erves to be confuted; its fal&s;ity appears at fir&s;t &s;ight. But to obviate entirely
<PB N="58" REF="59">
what might be &s;aid in its favour, we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that if the country had been peopled by giants, the entrance of the caves, from whence they have drawn &s;tones for the&s;e edifices, mu&s;t have been greater than they are: that the gates of the ancient buildings, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, would have had in like manner more height and breadth, for the more ea&s;y going in, and coming out of the giants; and that the pa&s;&s;ages of the pyramids, &s;o narrow at pre&s;ent, that &s;carce a man of the pre&s;ent time can drag him&s;elf along, when lying on his belly, would have been by no means proper for men of &s;uch a &s;tature.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, nothing gives a more ju&s;t idea of the &s;ta|ture of the men of that aera, than the urn, or the Sar|cophagus, in the greate&s;t and la&s;t pyramid, neare&s;t to Grand Cairo. This exi&s;ting and irrefragable proof annihilates all tho&s;e extravagant ideas, that might be formed of the exi&s;tence of giants. It determines the &s;ize of the body of the prince, for whom the pyramid was built; and the pa&s;&s;ages of that pyramid further &s;hew, that the workmen were not of larger &s;ize than the prince; &s;ince the entrance, and the egre&s;s, &s;carce give &s;ufficient room for men of &s;uch a &s;tature as they have at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The principal pyramids are at the South-ea&s;t of Gaza; and, as &s;everal authors have pretended that
<PB N="59" REF="60">
the city of Memphis was built on this &s;pot, they are univer&s;ally denominated the pyramids of Memphis.</P>
<P>There are four which are more particularly the ob|ject of attention; for, though there are &s;even or eight others, at no great di&s;tance, yet they are not to be compared with the&s;e; e&s;pecially &s;ince they have been opened, and almo&s;t entirely ruined. The four prin|cipal ones are almo&s;t upon the &s;ame diagonal line, and di&s;tant from each other about four hundred paces. The two mo&s;t northerly pyramids are the large&s;t, and have five hundred feet perpendicular height. The two others are much le&s;s; but have &s;ome peculiarities which occa&s;ion their being examined and admired.</P>
<P>The four faces, of all the pyramids, corre&s;pond preci&s;ely with the four cardinal points; the North, the South, the Ea&s;t, and the We&s;t. The &s;ituation of the&s;e, with their adjacent parts, &s;hews in what manner they have been rai&s;ed, upon the rock, at the foot of the mountains. The rock, not having been thoroughly even, has been &s;moothed by a chi&s;&s;el; and this arti|ficial plain has a &s;loping on the North, and on the Ea&s;t &s;ides, to give convenience for tran&s;porting the materials, nece&s;&s;ary for the pyramids. This plain may have about eighty feet of elevation, above the horizon of the ground, which is always overflowed
<PB N="60" REF="61">
by the Nile; and it has a Dani&s;h league in circum|ference.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Northern of the&s;e great pyramids is the only one that is open; and, as it is the fir&s;t met with, we &s;hall begin with a de&s;cription of it, and then pro|ceed to the others.</P>
<P>The figure of a pyramid is &s;o well known, that it would be &s;uperfluous to attempt de&s;cribing it; we &s;hall only ob&s;erve that it is the mo&s;t &s;olid figure that it is po&s;&s;ible to give to the main body of a building. There is no de&s;troying it, but by beginning at the &s;ummit. It re&s;ts on a ba&s;is too firm to be attacked in that part; and whoever &s;hould attempt it would find as much difficulty, as there was in rai&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The external part of the pyramid is chiefly built of great &s;quare &s;tones, laid upon each other, without cramps, cut out of the rock along the Nile; and where, even at this day, we &s;ee the caves from whence they have taken them out.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tones are nothing near &s;o hard as might be imagined, on account of their having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long a time. They owe their pre&s;ervation, properly, to the climate where they are, which is not &s;ubject to fre|quent
<PB N="61" REF="62">
rains. Notwith&s;tanding this advantage, it may be ob&s;erved, on the North &s;ide, that they are rotten.</P>
<P>In the centre of the pyramid is a chamber, which contains a tomb, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that of <HI>Cheops,</HI> king of Egypt, founder of the pyramid; being one entire piece of marble, hollowed, and uncovered at the top, which &s;ounds like a bell, on being &s;truck. There are no &s;igns of any corp&s;e having been laid in it. The interior part of this &s;arcophagus is &s;ix feet in length, and two in depth and breadth. It is not ea&s;y to conceive how this &s;arcophagus was brought into the place where it now &s;tands; it being impo&s;&s;ible that it could have entered by the narrow pa&s;&s;ages which lead to this chamber. It is therefore rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e there mu&s;t have been &s;ome other entrance, &s;o artfully &s;topped up, as not to be di&s;cerned. The dimen&s;ions of this chamber are thirty-four feet in length, &s;even|teen in breadth, and nineteen and a half in height.</P>
<P>It is compo&s;ed of more than two hundred layers of &s;tone, that recede in proportion to their height; which is from four feet to two. Of the&s;e &s;tones &s;ome are above thirty feet in length. The&s;e enormous &s;teps mu&s;t all be mounted to arrive at the &s;ummit. This &s;ummit, which, to tho&s;e who view it from below, &s;eems a point, is a fine platform, compo&s;ed of ten or twelve ma&s;&s;y &s;tones; and each &s;ide of that platform &s;ixteen
<PB N="62" REF="63">
or eighteen feet in length. The area of this edifice is computed to be about the dimen&s;ions of the large&s;t &s;quare in London, and the height one third above that of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The large one, according to <HI>Greaves</HI>'s mea&s;urement, is &s;even hundred feet &s;quare, covering about eleven acres of ground; the inclined plane is equal to the ba&s;e, &s;o that the angles and ba&s;e make an equi-lateral triangle: the perpendicular height, as we have before ob&s;erved, is five hundred feet. The apex is thirteen feet &s;quare.</P>
<P>With what maje&s;ty, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> do the&s;e mountains of man ri&s;e to the regions of air! Awful in their age, how often has the ri&s;ing &s;un enlightened them; &s;corched their burning &s;ides at noon, and gilded them as he &s;at! During how many ages have they, keeping pace with the inconceivably &s;wift motion of the earth, annually encircled this grand luminary! Man then has con&s;tructed durable edifices, and the&s;e edifices are tombs! Thou&s;ands of ages hence, if undi&s;turbed by any grand revolution in the earth, travellers from en|lightned nations, &s;hall go to admire the&s;e va&s;t monu|ments, and &s;ay Europe &s;carce had a few &s;avages &s;cat|tered over her fore&s;ts, when a learned nation erected the&s;e &s;uperb mau&s;oleums, toward the four cardinal
<PB N="63" REF="64">
points of heaven, as monuments of its piety and a&s;|tronomical knowledge.</P>
<P>The other three pyramids, which are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, do not appear ever to have been opened.</P>
<P>Though an entrance has been di&s;covered only into the large&s;t pyramid, yet, mo&s;t probably, there is a way into the others, and likewi&s;e apartments in them; &s;ince <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us that in the middle of the pyramids there is a &s;tone, which may be taken out, to open a a pa&s;&s;age to the tombs. Attempts have been made, but without effect, to di&s;cover an entrance into the &s;e|cond, a great breach appearing in one of the &s;ides of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e four grand pyramids are &s;urrounded by a number of other that are &s;maller; and which appear to have been opened.</P>
<P><HI>Tavernier</HI> tells us, that the curio&s;ity of &s;trangers has been &s;o great as to be de&s;irous of vi&s;iting the in|terior parts of &s;ome of the&s;e pyramids; and that once, the fellow that &s;hewed them took an opportu|nity to &s;hut &s;ome Engli&s;hmen in, and leave them there to die with want, purpo&s;ely to plunder them of their property. Their bodies were not removed, and &s;oon after, another party, going on the &s;ame errand, at|tended
<PB N="64" REF="65">
by a new exhibiter, were &s;truck motionle&s;s at the &s;ight of the dead bodies of their countrymen. We tru&s;t this will be &s;ufficient to caution travellers not to let their curio&s;ity get the better of their prudence.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t of the &s;econd pyramid is the head of the great, and famous Sphinx, the whole body of which is buried in the &s;and, the top of the back only to be &s;een; which is above a hundred feet long, and is of a &s;ingle &s;tone, making part of the rock on which the pyramid re&s;ts. Its head ri&s;es about &s;even and twenty feet above the &s;ands. <HI>Mahomet</HI> has taught the Arabs to hold all images of men, or animals, in dete&s;tation; and they have disfigured the face with their arrows and lances. The dimen&s;ions of this fi|gure, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> were as follow: the circum|ference of the head, one hundred and two feet; the length of the legs, one hundred and thirty-three feet; the height, from the bottom of the belly to the &s;um|mit of the head, &s;ixty-three feet; and the head and neck, twenty-&s;even feet. It is &s;aid to have been the tomb of <HI>Ama&s;is;</HI> but is more famous on account of the enigmatical oracles delivered from it, to all who came thither to con&s;ult it; and from the ambiguous terms in which they were couched, have given ri&s;e to the proverbial expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Sphinx's riddles,</HI> applied to any thing difficult to be &s;olved. At the top of the head there was originally a hole, as likewi&s;e on the
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="65" REF="67">
back, from whence i&s;&s;ued the an&s;wers dictated by their prie&s;ts, who were placed within.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid, concerning the judgment we ought to form of the pyramids, may be applied to the labyrinth, which <HI>Herodotus</HI> a&s;&s;ures us was &s;till more &s;urprizing than the pyramids. It was not &s;o much one &s;ingle palace, as a magnificent pile, compo&s;ed of twelve palaces, regularly di&s;po&s;ed, which had a com|munication with each other. Fifteen hundred rooms, inter&s;per&s;ed with terraces, were ranged round twelve halls, and di&s;covered no outlet to &s;uch as went to &s;ee them. There were the like number of buildings un|der ground. In order to vi&s;it the rooms, and halls of the labyrinth, it was nece&s;&s;ary, as the reader will naturally &s;uppo&s;e, for people to take the &s;ame pre|caution, as <HI>Ariadne</HI> made <HI>The&s;eus</HI> u&s;e, when he was obliged to go and fight the minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete.</P>
<P>This monument, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> regarded by <HI>Pliny</HI> as the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effort of human genius, is no more to be found. Hereafter, when Europe &s;hall have re&s;tored to Egypt the &s;ciences it thence received, perhaps, the &s;ands and rubbi&s;h, which hide the &s;ub|terranean part of the labyrinth, will be removed, and precious antiquities obtained. If the du&s;t of Hercu|laneum, an incon&s;iderable city, has pre&s;erved &s;o many
<PB N="66" REF="68">
rarities, and in&s;tructive remains of art and antiquity, what may not be expected from the fifteen hundred apartments in which the archives of Egypt were de|po&s;ited; &s;ince the government a&s;&s;embled here to treat of the mo&s;t important affairs of religion and of &s;tate?</P>
<P>But the noble&s;t and mo&s;t wonderful of all the &s;truc|tures, or works of the kings of Egypt, was the lake of <HI>Moeris.</HI> Accordingly <HI>Herodotus</HI> con&s;iders it as va&s;tly &s;uperior to the pyramids and labyrinth. This lake, according to the above writer, was &s;ix hundred and thirty &s;tadia, or &s;eventy-five leagues, in circum|ference, and three hundred feet deep. This work, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and va&s;t the earth ever contained, united every advantage, and &s;upplied the defi|ciences of a low inundation, by detaining waters which would have been u&s;ele&s;sly expended in the &s;ea. Hi&s;tory knows not a work &s;o glorious; nor is it won|derful antiquity e&s;teemed it above the pyramids and labyrinth; for, with the grandeur of the enterprize, it included the happine&s;s of the people. Thus the Egyptians, who dete&s;ted the kings by whom they were forced to remove mountains, that pyramids might be rai&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed the memory of <HI>Moeris,</HI> and his name is everla&s;ting; while the names of the founders of the pyramids are forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">In &s;ailing up the Nile, from Girge to E&s;&s;uan, oppo|&s;ite the Carnac, and about a league from the Nile, are to be &s;een two colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues. The fir&s;t &s;eems to re|pre&s;ent a man, and the &s;econd a woman. In other re&s;pects they are both of the &s;ame &s;ize, and that &s;ize is prodigious. They are about fifty feet high, from the ba&s;es of the pede&s;tal to the &s;ummit of the head. They are fitting on &s;tones, almo&s;t cubical, fifteen feet high, and as many in breadth, including in them the I&s;iac figures; which &s;eem for ornament to the two corners of each &s;tone. The back part of each &s;tone is higher than the fore part, by a foot and a half.</P>
<P>The pede&s;tals are each five feet high, thirty-&s;ix and a half long, and nineteen and a half broad. The di&s;|tance between the two &s;tatues is twenty-one paces.</P>
<P>The brea&s;ts and legs of the&s;e &s;tatues are covered with abundance of Greek and Latin in&s;criptions, which have been engraven on them &s;ince they were made, and in the time of the Romans. The purport of the&s;e in&s;criptions is, to &s;ignify that the voice of <HI>Memnon</HI> has been heard by tho&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e names were affixed to them.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of the&s;e colo&s;&s;u&s;es are &s;ome ruins, which no doubt are the remains of the palace of <HI>Mem|non.</HI> Among the&s;e ruins is the fragment of a colo&s;&s;us,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
thrown down and half buried. The upper part is wanting, and it appears that violence has been em|ployed to &s;eparate it. All the body of this colo&s;&s;us was of a &s;ingle piece of black granite marble. Its pede&s;tal is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, entire, and we &s;aw on it &s;ome hieroglyphics; &s;uch as knives, &s;emi-circles, and other figures. The re&s;t of this colo&s;&s;us, &s;ays <HI>Norden,</HI> is &s;o disfigured and di&s;membered, that it was not po&s;|&s;ibel for me to take an exact mea&s;ure of it. I ima|gine, however, that its height is about twenty feet. All the&s;e marks, he adds, &s;eem to indicate, that it is here we mu&s;t &s;eek for the vocal &s;tatue of <HI>Memnon,</HI> which <HI>Strabo, Pau&s;anias, Philo&s;tratus, Lucian, Juvenal, Tacitus,</HI> and divers other ancient authors. Greek and Latin, have mentioned. As mo&s;t of the&s;e authors re|late that the &s;tatue of <HI>Memnon</HI> gave a certain &s;ound, at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, I was curious to &s;trike with a key, upon what remains of this colo&s;&s;al figure; but as the whole is &s;olid, it does not give any more &s;ound than another block of granite which is &s;unk in the ground.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of <HI>Memnon</HI> had a lyre in his hands, which was &s;aid to &s;ound at &s;un-ri&s;ing; and &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers have &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;un's light po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mechanical impul&s;e, &s;o as to produce &s;uch &s;ounds. The &s;tatue was thrown down, and cut in two, by <HI>Cam|by&s;es,</HI> to di&s;cover its internal &s;tructure.&mdash;It &s;tood in the temple of <HI>Memnon,</HI> at Thebes.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="71"><HI>Strabo</HI>'s account of this &s;tatue is as follows.

It is be|lieved, that once every day, a noi&s;e, as of a &s;troke, but not a great one, is made from the remaining part, in the &s;eat and ba&s;e; and I being on the &s;pot, with OELIUS GALLEY, and a multitude of his friends and &s;oldiers attending him, about the fir&s;t hour of the day heard a noi&s;e: but whether from the ba&s;e, or the co|lo&s;&s;us, or whether it was made purpo&s;ely, by &s;ome one of tho&s;e that &s;tood round the ba&s;e, I cannot affirm. On account of the uncertainty of the cau&s;e, I am in|clined to believe any thing, rather than this, that a &s;ound is emitted from &s;tones &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. <HI>Pape</HI> 816, <HI>Edit.

The great <HI>Dio&s;polis,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Diodorus Sicu|lus,</HI> which the Greeks have named Thebes, was &s;ix leagues in circumference. The fame of its power and wealth, celebrated by <HI>Homer,</HI> has filled the world. Its gates, and the numerous ve&s;tibules of its temples, occa&s;ioned this poet to give it the name of Hecatom|polis. Four principal temples are e&s;pecially admired
<PB N="70" REF="72">
there; the mo&s;t ancient of which was &s;urprizingly grand and &s;umptuous. Of the&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the re|mains of one only are &s;till extant It has eight en|trances, three of which have each a &s;phinx, of enor|mous &s;ize, &s;tanding in front; with two colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, on each &s;ide of the &s;phinx, which are cut from a &s;ingle block of marble in the antique ta&s;te. Cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e maje&s;tic avenues, we come to four porticos; each thirty feet wide, fifty-two in height, and a hun|dred and fifty in length. Beyond the&s;e porticos, the high walls, which form the fir&s;t court of the temple, begin. The people entered at twelve gates. We then come to the &s;econd court, which leads to the temple; and, by its extent, equals the maje&s;ty of the building. Standing at this place, the a&s;toni&s;hed eye &s;urveys the temple; the height of which is mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing, in all its immen&s;ity. Its walls of marble ap|pear everla&s;ting. Its roof, which ri&s;es in the centre, is &s;u&s;tained by eighteen rows of columns. Tho&s;e &s;tanding under the mo&s;t lofty part are thirty feet in circumference, and eighty in height; the others one third le&s;s.</P>
<P>The world does not contain a building, the cha|racter and grandeur of which more forcibly impre&s;s awe and maje&s;ty; it &s;eems adequate to the high idea the Egyptians had formed of the &s;upreme Being; nor can it be entered, or beheld, but with reverence. Its
<PB N="71" REF="73">
&s;ides, both within and without, are loaded with hier|glyphics and extraordinary figures. On the northern wall are repre&s;entations of battles, with hor&s;es and chariots; one of which is drawn by &s;tags. On the &s;outhern are two barks, with canopies, at the end of which the &s;un appears; the mariners guide them with poles; two men, &s;eated at the &s;tern, &s;eem to direct their proceedings, and receive their homage.</P>
<P>The entrance, which fronts the temple, is greatly decayed; but, if we may judge from the obeli&s;ks which remain, it mu&s;t have been mo&s;t &s;umptuous. There are two of &s;ixty feet in height, and twenty-one in circumference, at the ba&s;e; and, a little farther, two others, of &s;eventy-two feet in height, and thirty in circumference. Were the ground occupied by the various entrances, porticos and courts appertaining to the temple, mea&s;ured, we &s;hall find the whole was, at lea&s;t, half a league in circumference; and that <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> was not deceived, when he allowed it that extent.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the plain, on which the ruins &s;tand, is the village of Luxor; near which are the ave|nues and remains of another temple, &s;till more ruinous than the fir&s;t. Its extent is &s;pacious, and &s;o are its courts; which are entered under porticos, &s;upported by columns forty feet high, without e&s;timating the ba&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="74">
buried under the &s;and. Pyramidical maje&s;tic gates, abounding in hieroglyphics, and rows of colo&s;&s;al mar|ble figures, forty feet high, one third buried in the ground, all declare what the magnificence of the prin|cipal edifice, the &s;cite of which is known by a hill of ruins, mu&s;t have been. But nothing can give a more &s;ublime idea of the grandeur, than the two obeli&s;ks which &s;eem to have been placed there by giants, or the genii of fable. They are each a &s;olid block of granite, &s;eventy-two feet high, above the &s;urface, and thirty-two in circumference; but, being &s;unk deep in the &s;and and mud, they may well be &s;uppo&s;ed ninety feet, from the ba&s;e to the &s;ummit. The hieroglyphics they contain do honour to the &s;culptor; the hardne&s;s of the &s;tone has pre&s;erved them from being injured by the air. Nothing can be more maje&s;tic than the&s;e obeli&s;ks. Egypt is the &s;ole country in the world, where men have performed works like the&s;e; yet there is not a city on the face of the globe, where they would not become its greate&s;t ornament.</P>
<P>Such are the mo&s;t remarkable ornaments, found at pre&s;ent, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Thebes. Their very a&s;pect would awaken the genius of a poli&s;hed nation; but the Turks and Copts, cru&s;hed to death beneath an iron &s;ceptre, behold them, without a&s;toni&s;hment; and build huts, which can &s;carce &s;creen them from the &s;un in their neighbourhood. The&s;e barbarians, if
<PB N="73" REF="75">
they want a mill&s;tone, do not blu&s;h to overturn a co|lumn, which &s;upports a temple or portico, and &s;aw it in pieces.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide, of this once magnificent city, are the grottos, or tombs, of the ancient monarchs of the Thebais. <HI>Diodorus</HI> reckons forty-&s;even of them; but only nine are at pre&s;ent open, the re&s;t having been clo&s;ed up. The &s;ubterranean galleries, leading to them, are, in general, ten feet high, and as many in breadth. The walls and roof, cut in a white rock, pre&s;erve the brilliant poli&s;h of &s;tucco. The &s;econd grotto is &s;pacious, and much embelli&s;hed, containing, on the ceiling, numerous golden &s;tars; birds, painted in colours, which &s;eem to have lo&s;t nothing of their fre&s;hne&s;s and brilliancy; and hieroglyphics, divided in columns, and engraved in the walls. Two men are &s;eated be&s;ide the gate, the pa&s;&s;age to which is a long gentle declivity. A block of red granite, &s;ix|teen feet high, ten long, and &s;ix wide, forms the &s;arco|phagus of the king, who is &s;culptured in bas relief, on the top of the tomb, with an hieroglyphic in&s;cription. There is one exceedingly fine grotto, which contains only a marble lid, ten feet long, and &s;ix wide; and in the further part of the mo&s;t di&s;tant cavern is a human figure, with the arms cro&s;&s;ing the brea&s;t; and two others, kneeling, one on each &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">The&s;e galleries and &s;ubterranean apartments, which go very far under the mountains, and a very &s;mall part of which are here de&s;cribed, are embelli&s;hed by marble figures of men, birds, and various animals; &s;ome &s;culptured in bas relief, others cut hollow, and &s;ome painted in colours which are not to be effaced. The&s;e unintelligible characters, which contain the hi&s;|tory of the times, conceal beneath their impenetrable veil, mo&s;t intere&s;ting di&s;coveries, and the mo&s;t re|markable facts, relative to the monarchs of the The|bais, who&s;e power extended as far as India. Torches are nece&s;&s;ary in examining the&s;e labyrinths, into which the light of day cannot penetrate.</P>
<P>Such are the caverns where the bodies of kings repo&s;e, &s;urrounded by &s;ilence and &s;hades. A kind of religious terror is felt, while wandering through them; as if the pre&s;ence of the living di&s;turbed the dead in their a&s;ylums, where they have retired to re&s;t in peaceful &s;leep.</P>
<P>Returning from the&s;e dark abodes, and proceeding South-ea&s;t, the traveller &s;oon meets with the remains of a temple; on the &s;quare pillows of which are &s;ta|tues, that have all had their heads broken off; each holding a &s;ceptre in one hand, and a whip in the other. The remains of the buildings, belonging to this temple, cover a mile of ground. In one of

the courts are parts of two &s;tatues of black marble, which were thirty feet high; in the other, the tra|veller &s;tands in &s;tupid amazement, at beholding a co|lo&s;&s;al figure extended on the ground, and broken near the middle. The &s;pace between the &s;houlders is one and twenty feet; the head eleven feet in length, and eighteen in circumference. This gigantic &s;tatue is only inferior in &s;ize to that of <HI>Memnon.</HI></P>
<P>About half a league further are the ruins of Memnonium; where is the large&s;t colo&s;&s;us of Egypt. The circumference of the&s;e ruins is about half a league. On entering them the traveller is &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, at the &s;ight of two gigantic figures, which &s;eem like rocks; and are &s;eated be&s;ide each other. Their pede&s;tals are nearly equal; and formed from blocks of granite, thirty feet long, and eighteen wide. The &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatues is al&s;o one &s;ingle &s;tone; the other, the large&s;t in Egypt, is formed of five different pieces of granite, and broken in the middle. Some idea may be formed of the gigantic &s;ize of the grand colo&s;&s;us, when we are told that its feet alone are &s;even feet long. This &s;tatue, the half of which remains on its ba&s;e, and which <HI>Strabo</HI> calls the &s;tatue of <HI>Memnon,</HI> uttered a &s;ound at &s;un-ri&s;ing, as hath before been ob&s;erved. Several writers have &s;poken of it with enthu&s;ia&s;m, regarding it as one of the &s;even wonders of the world. A croud of

Greek and Latin in&s;criptions, which are &s;till legible, on the base and legs of the colo&s;&s;us, atte&s;t that princes, generals, governors, and men of all conditions have heard this miraculous &s;ound.</P>
<P>Such are the remains of Thebes, and her hundred gates, the antiquity of which is lo&s;t in the ob&s;curity of ages; and which &s;till contain proofs of the pro|fu&s;ion of arts in tho&s;e mo&s;t di&s;tant times.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF ARABIA, FROM THE LATEST AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Country, Climate, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t celebrated countries in the world, one of the large&s;t provinces in A&s;ia, and lies near the borders of Africa. Its boundaries, according to <HI>Cluverius,</HI> and other e&s;teemed geogra|phers, are, Babylon and the gulph of Per&s;ia, on the Ea&s;t; the Indian ocean, on the South; the Red Sea, with part of Egypt, on the We&s;t; and Pale&s;tine, Sy|ria, and the river Euphrates, to the North. Its ex|treme length is about four hundred and thirty Ger|man leagues; but its greate&s;t breadth is not more than three hundred and forty; and, in &s;ome parts, not above one hundred and eighty. It is &s;ituated be|tween thirty-five and &s;ixty degrees of Ea&s;tern longi|tude, and between twelve and thirteen degrees of North latitude.</P>
<P>Arabia is the ancient, as well as the modern name; though the people have been long called Saracens, or inhabitants of the de&s;arts; Sarra, in their language,
<PB N="78" REF="81">
&s;ignifying a de&s;art. Some derive the name of Arabia from Harrabi, a thief or robber, as they have been ge|nerally e&s;teemed, ever &s;ince they were a nation, to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The modern divi&s;ion of this country is into &s;ix large provinces; the HEDSJAS, &s;ituated along the Arabian gulph, from <HI>Sinai</HI> to <HI>Yemen,</HI> and extending to the province of <HI>Nedsjed;</HI> the &s;econd is the YEMEN in general, which may be &s;ubdivided into the terri|tories of the Iman of Sarra: a province which ex|tends from the borders of Hedsjas, along the Arabian gulph; and from the Indian Sea, to <HI>Hadramaut.</HI> The other provinces are, HADRAMAUT, OMAN, LACHSA, and NEDSJED.</P>
<P>It was formerly divided into three parts, according to the nature of their re&s;pective &s;oils, viz. Arabia Fe|lix, Arabia De&s;erta, and Arabia Petraea. Arabia Felix, which is the South-ea&s;t part, according to the pre&s;ent divi&s;ion, and now called Yemen, contained at lea&s;t four parts, in five, of the whole. Arabia De|&s;erta, which lies to the northward, is next in &s;ize; and Arabia Petraea, &s;ituated on the I&s;thmus of Suez, is the lea&s;t. But the exact boundaries of this country, either ancient or modern, are very uncertain; or ra|ther there are no preci&s;e boundaries; for the inland country, being under the government of a great num|ber
<PB N="79" REF="82">
of Sheiks, or Arabian Princes, who march from place to place, and encamp where they can find water and pa&s;ture for their cattle, their re&s;pective dominions have &s;carce any fixed boundary; nor is it ea&s;y to &s;ay which part of the country belongs to one of the&s;e di|vi&s;ions, and which to another.</P>
<P>The &s;eas, and promontories of Arabia, are, the Indian ocean, the gulph of Ba&s;&s;ora and Ormus, the Red Sea, and the &s;traits of Babelmandel.</P>
<P>The Red Sea, &s;ometimes called the Arabian gulph, divides Arabia from Egypt and Ethiopia; but if taken in its large&s;t extent, the name of the Red Sea was an|ciently given to all tho&s;e &s;eas, which border upon Arabia and Per&s;ia, from Africa to the Ea&s;t Indies. The rea&s;on of its being called the Red Sea, &s;ome at|tribute to the red mountains near it; others that the red &s;and of the coa&s;t gave it that name. It is called in &s;cripture the &s;ea of weeds, or ru&s;hes, the banks being overflowed with them in &s;ome places; but from whatever cau&s;e the name is derived, no &s;ea has been more celebrated than this; fir&s;t, from its having been the pa&s;&s;age of the Iraelites through it; and &s;econdly, from its having been the u&s;ual convey|ance for the fine &s;pices, and all the rich merchandize of the Ea&s;t, to Africa and Europe, for three thou&s;and years, and upwards.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83">No country is more de&s;titute of rivers: Chat, Pran, and Nagiran are the principal ones, neither of which are navigable; and &s;ome add the we&s;tern branch of the Euphrates, which runs near the boundaries of this country. The mountains are tho&s;e of Gebel, Ared, or the great mountains in the middle of the country; and tho&s;e of Mount Sinai and Horeb, in Arabia Petraea.</P>
<P>A country which, like Arabia, extends from the twelfth, to the fifteenth degree of North latitude, and con&s;equently &s;ituated, in part, between the tropics, pre&s;ents the idea of a climate where the heat mu&s;t be inten&s;e. In &s;ome of the provinces, &s;ays <HI>Nieu|burk,</HI> the heat is intolerable. But it is in this coun|try, as in many others, where the elevation of the ground, the &s;ituation of place, and the nature of the &s;oil, occa&s;ion a great difference in the climate.</P>
<P>To comprehend this, we mu&s;t form a ju&s;t idea of the local &s;ituation of the country. Arabia may be con&s;idered as a country full of mountains, and &s;ur|rounded, on all &s;ides, by a va&s;t extent of barren and &s;andy plains.</P>
<P>In the&s;e de&s;arts, &s;cattered with naked rocks, there is nothing to prevent the action of the &s;un, which burns all kinds of vegetables, and reduces the lands
<PB N="81" REF="84">
to parched &s;ands. The drought is &s;o great, that it of|ten does not rain for three years together; and the rivers, which de&s;cend from the mountains, lo&s;e them|&s;elves in the &s;ands, without being able to get to the &s;ea. Were it not for the&s;e rivers, which overflow in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and from which canals are dug to water the grounds, the farmers would not be able to obtain the &s;malle&s;t crop of corn. From ob&s;ervations made with good thermometers, &s;ays <HI>Nieuburk,</HI> we found that in the&s;e plains, as for example, at Loheya, Mocha, and Mu&s;cat, the heats were as violent as in the hotter countries.</P>
<P>The interior of this country pre&s;ents a very dif|ferent temperature. Long chains of mountains, very lofty, attract vapours; which, di&s;&s;olving in copious rains, refre&s;h the air, and animate vegetation. The cold, produced by the elevation of this mountainous part of the country, occa&s;ions &s;now there; which, however, does not la&s;t long. And while the inha|bitants of the plains are overcome with the heat, tho&s;e of the mountains are obliged to envelop them&s;elves with their peli&s;es.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of the&s;e mountains, in the mid&s;t of a country &s;o much &s;urrounded by &s;ea, is al&s;o the cau&s;e of a phenomenon which is ob&s;erved in the penin&s;ula of the Ganges, inter&s;ected by mountains. This is
<PB N="82" REF="85">
the difference in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, which are regular in the countries &s;ituated between the tropics. In the we&s;tern part of Arabia, in the Yemen, the rainy &s;ea|&s;on is the more &s;erviceable, as it begins in tbe middle of the month of June, and la&s;ts till the middle of Sep|tember, which are months when the heats are greate&s;t; and where the earth, and its inhabitants, have mo&s;t need of refre&s;hment. In the ea&s;tern part of the&s;e mountains, near Ma&s;kat, the&s;e rains fall, from the mid|dle of November, till the middle of February; and on the &s;outhern &s;ide of Arabia, the rainy &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts from the middle of February, till the middle of April. Thus the rains appear to make the circuit of the pen|in&s;ula, according to the impul&s;e of the predominant winds, during each &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This regularity in the rains makes the valleys very fertile and plea&s;ant, which &s;eparate the chains of moun|tains. The people likewi&s;e, who inhabit the&s;e moun|tains, by breathing a fre&s;h and pure air, are well-made, healthy and robu&s;t. Another advantage, which the Arabians derive, from the &s;ituation of their country, is, that they have the productions of different climates at the &s;ame time. In the plains are to be &s;een many vegetables, tran&s;planted from India; and al&s;o a great number of the animals of hot countries. The moun|tains produce the plants of temperate climates, and the animals of tho&s;e climates al&s;o thrive there. In
<PB N="83" REF="86">
&s;hort, Arabia may be con&s;idered as an a&s;&s;emblage of different climates, the real advantages of which are united in the &s;pace, contained between the Red Sea, and the Per&s;ian gulph.</P>
<P>The nature of the winds is very different in Ara|bia, according to the point from whence they come, and the &s;pace they blow over; &s;o that the wind from the &s;ame point is moi&s;t or dry, in different places, when it traver&s;es the ocean or the de&s;arts. Upon the borders of the Per&s;ian gulph, the South-ea&s;t wind brings with it a humid atmo&s;phere; which cau&s;es a very violent and oppre&s;&s;ive per&s;piration: the North-we&s;t wind, pa&s;&s;ing over the great de&s;art, is much hotter, but not &s;o relaxing. This latter wind, how|ever, heats the metals in the &s;hade, as if they were expo&s;ed to the &s;un; and its heat, when joined &s;ud|denly to that of the atmo&s;phere, often &s;uffocates both man and bea&s;t. The Arabians carry with them, when they travel, garlick and dried rai&s;ins, as remedies, with which they generally re&s;tore to life tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom the&s;e hot gu&s;ts of wind have &s;uffocated.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding its burning quality, this North-we&s;t wind &s;erves to cool the drink of the Arabs, in the middle of &s;ummer. For this purpo&s;e they put the water in un-glazed pots, made of porous earth, which they hang up in &s;ome place, expo&s;ed to the current of
<PB N="84" REF="87">
this hot wind. The water, by this means, becomes very cool; a phenomenon known in almo&s;t all hot countries, and which philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent age very well account for, as proceeding from a &s;udden evaporation.</P>
<P>Another wind, of a &s;till more dangerous kind, is the <HI>Samiel;</HI> rarely to be met with in Arabia, but very common on the frontiers. This wind is predominant only on the borders of the great de&s;art, where the agitation carries with it inflamed vapours; which the action of the &s;un kindles in this burning &s;and. The places, mo&s;t expo&s;ed to this dreadful wind, are, the borders of the Euphrates; and, &s;ometimes, the en|virons of Mecca, when the North wind blows on the &s;ide of the de&s;art. The effect of the <HI>Samiel</HI> is to &s;uf|focate, in an in&s;tant, like a fla&s;h of lightning, every living creature, within the &s;pace of its activity; and to occa&s;ion the bodies to become, in a &s;hort time, pu|trid. As it has been remarked that an almo&s;t imme|mediate putrefaction has taken place, in the bodies of animals, which have been killed by lightning, or by an electrical &s;hock, it has been &s;ugge&s;ted that this wind might be occa&s;ioned, by &s;ome electrical fluid, which is &s;o univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed; the Arabs can tell when this wind is coming, from an extraordinary red|ne&s;s in the air; and they pretend to remark, as it pa&s;&s;es along, a &s;mell of &s;ulphur. Whether this be the
<PB N="85" REF="88">
ca&s;e, or not, the only means for a per&s;on to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the fatal effects of this &s;ingular wind, is, to throw him&s;elf on the ground, with his face down|ward, till the &s;torm has blown over; the vapours of which always keep at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the ground.</P>
<P>The other meteors, in Arabia, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e in all hot countries. A &s;erene &s;ky, &s;eldom ob|&s;cured by clouds, is the rea&s;on that there are few &s;torms in the de&s;arts. The air di&s;charges it&s;elf of the electrical matter by balls of fire, and by the pheno|menon of falling &s;tars; which are frequently &s;een, and of a very con&s;iderable &s;ize. In the more de&s;art parts, near the &s;ea, the dews are very copious. Not|with&s;tanding this humidity, the air is &s;o pure, that it is u&s;ual for the inhabitants to &s;leep on the tops of their hou&s;es. There are, however, &s;ome parts, where a per&s;on, indulging him&s;elf in this cu&s;tom, is liable to be &s;eized with a fit of the pal&s;y. But the inhabitants, from long experience, know what precautions they ought, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to take.</P>
<P>Arabia has the advantage of, nearly, one continued verdure. The trees, indeed, lo&s;e their leaves every year, and the annual plants wither, before they &s;hoot out a-fre&s;h; but the interval, between the fall of the leaves, and the trees budding again, is &s;o &s;mall, that
<PB N="86" REF="89">
the change is &s;carce perceived. To have the face of a country cloathed with continual verdure, is an ad|vantage peculiar to tho&s;e latitudes, where there is no fro&s;t, and where the rainy &s;ea&s;on occupies the winter quarter.</P>
<P>From the &s;ingular po&s;ition of Arabia, it will be ea&s;y to conceive that the nature of the &s;oil mu&s;t vary very much. In fact nothing can be more oppo&s;ite. On one &s;ide there is nothing to be &s;een but de&s;arts of &s;and; and, on the other, beautiful and fertile valleys. The &s;andy plain, which &s;urrounds this penin&s;ula, is almo&s;t entirely barren; and pre&s;ents to view nothing but the image of de&s;olation.</P>
<P>This plain of &s;and, called Tehama, begins at Suez, and extends all round the penin&s;ula, to the mouth of the river Euphrates. Its breadth is unequal; in ge|neral it takes two days to cro&s;s the Red Sea, to the foot of the mountains. This part of the de&s;art ap|pears to have been covered with the &s;ea: the bottom is a grey clay, mixed with a great deal of &s;and, and containing a great number of bones, and &s;hells of &s;ea-fi&s;h, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore. There are al&s;o great heaps of &s;alt, in &s;ufficient quantity to form even little mountains. Its regular de&s;cent to the &s;hore plainly indicates that it became dry by de|grees. There is no doubt but the &s;ea is continually
<PB N="87" REF="90">
retreating from this coa&s;t, and the Tehama gradually gaining fre&s;h ground. The &s;and-banks are continu|ally increa&s;ing, and, as they approach the &s;hore, ren|der the navigation of the gulph &s;till more dangerous. Hi&s;tory al&s;o proves this increa&s;e of land; it mentions many places as &s;ea-ports, which are now at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the coa&s;t; and pa&s;&s;es over in &s;ilence, tho&s;e which are now maritime towns; the exi&s;tence of which mu&s;t con&s;equently be dated &s;ince the formation of the lands, where they are &s;ituated.</P>
<P>This acqui&s;ition of territory is of little advantage to the inhabitants; it being entirely barren, and pro|ducing nothing. Nor is there any hope of its being ever made better; as the &s;oil of this province has re|mained the &s;ame for many ages.</P>
<P>In the mountainous part of Arabia, the &s;oil varies very much; and is, in general, a clay mixed with &s;and. Their form prevents their being very fertile; they are commonly very &s;teep and pointed, &s;o that they neihter afford &s;ufficient &s;pace to &s;pontaneous ve|getable productions, nor &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment; be|cau&s;e the torrents are continually carrying away the good land. The cultivation of them is likewi&s;e, owing to this circum&s;tance, very laborious and ex|pen&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">This country may be con&s;idered as intere&s;ting, in many particulars; but, in general, it is neither rich, nor fertile. Of this, the laborious life the pea&s;ants lead, and their indifferent food, are evident proofs. If it was called Arabia <HI>Felix</HI> by the ancients, it mu&s;t have merited this name, rather by the value and rarity of its productions, than from their abundance.</P>
<P>Their mountains they never endeavour to culti|vate; they being, for the mo&s;t part, &s;chi&s;tuous, and &s;carce capable of any improvement. Their valleys &s;eem equally barren, where water is wanting, and pro|duce &s;carce any herbage; but in tho&s;e, where it can be introduced, they produce corn, vegetables, and and flowers; and no country in the world affords a more picture&s;que view. The Arabs draw the water in large &s;kins, from the wells, with oxen, both morn|ing and evening; conveying it along little canals, by the &s;ides of which their trees and plants are &s;et. They al&s;o cut little channels through their corn-fields, by which they let the water into them, as often as they have a mind.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o, in this part of Arabia, a great va|riety of fine fruits; &s;uch as oranges, lemons, grapes, peaches, and apricots; but what this country is mo&s;t famous for, is, their dates and their coffee: with which a great number of &s;hips are laden, every year,
<PB N="89" REF="92">
for Europe and India; be&s;ides large quantities &s;ent to Turkey.</P>
<P>The coffee &s;hrub grows eight or ten feet high, with a grey &s;mooth bark; the wood is white, and without much pith. The twigs ri&s;e by pairs, oppo&s;ite to each other, and the leaves on the twigs in the &s;ame man|ner; the fruit hangs to the twig by a foot-&s;talk, &s;ome|times one, two, or more in the &s;ame place. The&s;e &s;hrubs are planted in a rich &s;oil, and watered by arti|ficial canals; after three or four years bearing, the natives plant new &s;hrubs, as the old ones then begin to decline. The berries are dried in the &s;un, and the outward hu&s;k afterwards taken off with hand-mills; and the&s;e hu&s;ks the Arabians infu&s;e in boiling water, when the heat is inten&s;e, in&s;tead of berries; e&s;teeming the liquor more cooling.</P>
<P>Arabia al&s;o abounds in myrrh, manna, ca&s;&s;ia, in|cen&s;e, aloes, balm and frankincen&s;e; be&s;ides &s;ome other valuable drugs. Among their trees nothing is more wanted than timber; and indeed there is &s;carce any wood in the country.</P>
<P>All uncivilized nations have remedies, derived from vegetables, with who&s;e virtues they are ac|quainted by tradition. The Arabs are not without &s;uch kind of medicines; of which they have made
<PB N="90" REF="93">
u&s;e, from time immemorial, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as a &s;tranger can hardly credit. Aloes and euphorbia are too &s;ufficiently known to dwell upon them; in Arabia the different &s;pecies of this latter plant are &s;o numerous, that it may be looked upon as an indi|genous plant. In hot countries counter-poi&s;ons are &s;et great &s;tore by, on account of the venemous bea&s;ts with which they are infe&s;ted. By long experience, the inhabitants of the&s;e countries are acquainted with tho&s;e plants, which are &s;alutary to men, and the con|trary to the&s;e dangerous animals. The Arabs appear, however, to be ignorant of the virtues of <HI>Ophiorrizo,</HI> &s;o common in their mountains. On the contrary, they &s;et great value by the <HI>Ari&s;tolochia &s;emper virens;</HI> which they look upon, not only as a remedy, but as a pre&s;ervative, again&s;t the bite of &s;erpents. Accord|ing to their opinion, a per&s;on who has drank a de|coction of the&s;e herbs, for forty days, cannot be bit by the&s;e venomous animals. Though this is not &s;uf|ficiently a&s;certained; yet it &s;eems probable, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who travel about with &s;erpents, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to their bites, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome &s;ecret to &s;ecure them&s;elves from their malignant effect.</P>
<P>Of their animals, tho&s;e mo&s;t u&s;eful and excellent in their kind, are, camels and hor&s;es. The camels are well adapted to this de&s;art country; the large&s;t of them will carry immen&s;e burdens; &s;ome writer;
<PB N="91" REF="94">
&s;ay near a thou&s;and pounds weight each. It is well known the Arabs &s;et great value on their hor&s;es. They divide them, &s;ays <HI>Nieuburk,</HI> into two kinds; the <HI>Kadi&s;chi,</HI> or tho&s;e hor&s;es who&s;e breed is not known; and the <HI>Kochlani,</HI> or hor&s;es who&s;e pedigree is traced back for above the&s;e two hundred years. The <HI>Ka|di&s;chi</HI> are held in no great e&s;teem, and are employed in hu&s;bandry, or in carrying burdens.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kochlani,</HI> on the contrary, are kept entirely for the &s;addle. They are very much prized, and con&s;equently very dear. The Arabs pretend they derive their origin from the harems of <HI>Solomon.</HI> Be this as it will, they are capable of enduring very great fatigue, and going for days together without food. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing ardour; it is even &s;aid, that a hor&s;e of this breed, when he finds him&s;elf wounded, and no longer able to carry his rider, will quit the field of battle, in order to carry him to a place of &s;afety. If the rider is thrown to the ground, the&s;e hor&s;es will remain near him, and not give over neighing, till &s;ome one comes to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The&s;e hor&s;es are neither large nor hand&s;ome, but very &s;wi&s;t; and the Arabs value them only on ac|cout of their pedigree, and their good qualities; but by no means for their figure.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95">The&s;e Arabs, it is true, have no genealogical tables to prove the pedigree of their Kochlani; but they are neverthele&s;s certain of the regularity of the de&s;cent, becau&s;e a mare of this breed is never covered but in the pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es. Though this peo|ple are not always very &s;crupulous about perjuring them&s;elves, they are more con&s;cientious in an affair of this kind; nor is there any in&s;tance of an Arab per|juring him&s;elf, re&s;pecting the breed of a hor&s;e; be|cau&s;e he is per&s;uaded, that he him&s;elf, and his whole family would be ruined, if, in an affair of &s;uch im|portance, be depo&s;ed what was not true.</P>
<P>The common food, both of camels and hor&s;es, is barley, or barley-meal, made into dough. But <HI>Theve|not</HI> &s;ays, that in &s;ome parts of Arabia the hor&s;es are fed with camel's milk; or with butter and wheat, and &s;ometimes with the fle&s;h of camels dried in the &s;un. A more modern writer &s;ays, the cattle at Mu&s;cat are fed with fi&s;h, not with &s;uch as are fre&s;h taken; but they dig a &s;mall pit, and having thrown a large quantity of fi&s;h in it, they are &s;uffered to remain there till they are rotten, and turned to a kind of earth, which is then taken up, boiled in water, and, when it has &s;tood till it is cold, is given to the cattle. This makes them very fat, nor does their fle&s;h ta&s;te ami&s;s, from the cattle being fed with this kind of diet. They have oxen, buffaloes, goats and veni&s;on; but their beef,
<PB N="93" REF="96">
and the fle&s;h of their buffaloes, is coar&s;e. As to hogs, they never breed any, being all Mahometans, who ab|hor the &s;ight of this animal. Fi&s;h and fowl are in great plenty on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts; but the inland parts are very indifferently &s;tocked; there being neither wood nor water to &s;upply them with wood and &s;helter. Lions, bears, tygers, wolves, jackalls, and other wild bea&s;ts are al&s;o found in &s;ome parts of Arabia; but not in great numbers, there being but little cover for them.</P>
<P>Among other carniverous animals, the mo&s;t fright|ful and dangerous is the hyaena; which attacks both men and bea&s;ts. This ferocious and &s;olitary animal inhabits the caverns of the barren mountains of Ara|bia Petraea; he is al&s;o to be met with in the environs of the Per&s;ian gulph. The hyaena prowls about only in the night. In the &s;ea&s;on, when the inhabitants &s;leep in the open air, he frequently carries off the children, who are lying near their parents. As the dome&s;tic animals of the &s;outhern part of Per&s;ia are fed chiefly on fi&s;h, he is obliged to eat the &s;ame kind of food.</P>
<P>Arabia appears to be the native country of the a&s;s; they are to be &s;een here of &s;uch a beautiful, vigorous, and animated &s;pecies, that their a&s;&s;es may be compared to hor&s;es. The inhabitants al&s;o mention a wild ani|mal,
<PB N="94" REF="97">
which they have called Djaear, of the &s;ize and figure of an a&s;s, the fle&s;h of which is good to eat. This animal is, perhaps, a wild a&s;s; who, by living in woods, acquires &s;ome peculiarities in its &s;hape, which make the Arabians, who know little of natural hi&s;|tory, mi&s;take it for &s;ome other animal.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts, in the &s;outhern part of Arabia, &s;warm with monkies who have no tails; and who&s;e buttocks are bare of hair, and red. I have &s;een troops, of &s;e|veral hundreds, &s;ays <HI>Nieuburk;</HI> other travellers have met them, by thou&s;ands, in the mountains of Aden. The&s;e animals are very docile, and learn all &s;orts of tricks with great facility. This occa&s;ions a great quantity of them to be exported into Egpyt, where the mountebanks exhibit them to the people.</P>
<P>In the cultivated parts of Arabia, poultry, of all kinds, is very common. Of game, or wild fowl, very little is to be met with by travellers. The Arabians, in general, do not think it worth their notice; and neither ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for the plea&s;ure, nor the labour, of hunt|ing. Two rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for their aver&s;ion to a pa&s;time, which con&s;titutes the &s;upreme felicity of the de&s;cendants from the &s;avages of the North. A people, naturally &s;ober and frugal, living under a cli|mate, where animal food is rather prejudicial, than otherwi&s;e, to health, cannot be very fond of game.
<PB N="95" REF="98">
The punctilious precepts of the Mahometan religion mu&s;t, be&s;ides, di&s;gu&s;t an Arab from the pur&s;uit of wild animals; and, e&s;pecially, birds. For, if he omits to &s;ay a &s;hort prayer, whil&s;t he is killing the animal; or if the animal does not lo&s;e the quantity of blood, pre&s;cribed by law; or if he was not killed in&s;tantly; or if he fell upon a &s;pot that was inhabited, or con|taminited: in all the&s;e in&s;tances, the &s;port&s;man lo&s;es his labour, or his prey is deemed impure.</P>
<P>A dry country, like Arabia, cannot breed any great quantities of aquatic birds. The birds which frequent the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, and &s;eed on fi&s;hes, are very common on the borders of the Red Sea; that &s;ea being very &s;hallow, and full of fi&s;h. O&s;triches are al&s;o to be met with, in the de&s;arts, which the Arabs call the de|&s;art-bird. Eagles, falcons, hawks and vultures are the birds of prey which are &s;een in Arabia. The la&s;t of the&s;e birds renders &s;ignal &s;ervices; he purges the earth from all carca&s;es, who&s;e corruption is &s;o &s;udden, and dangerous, in hot countries; and he de&s;troys the field-mice, which would otherwi&s;e render u&s;ele&s;s the labours of the hu&s;bandmen. The&s;e e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices have made this bird to be con&s;idered as &s;acred, by the ancient Egyptians; and there are &s;till many countries where they are not permitted to be killed.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="99">In many countries of the Ea&s;t, as in Arabia, is another bird no le&s;s u&s;eful to the inhabitants. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to come from Kora&s;an, and arrives in Ara|bia about July, or Augu&s;t; following the &s;warms of locu&s;ts, of which it de&s;troys an incredible quantity. It is called Samarmar. The &s;ervices which this bird renders to the countries, expo&s;ed to the ravages of the&s;e in&s;ects, occa&s;ions, in Syria, many ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms. This bird is thought to be en|ticed by the Kora&s;an water, which is brought, with great ceremony, from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and kep in a re&s;ervoir, made of &s;tone, on the top of the tower of the mo&s;ques. If this water &s;ails, the inha|bitants are in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>There are many kinds of &s;erpents, in Arabia, who&s;e bite is often mortal; there are, however, as many more that are harmle&s;s. The bite of &s;ome only occa&s;ions a di&s;agreeable itching, which the inha|bitants ea&s;ily cure. In general, the bite of tho&s;e &s;er|pents only is mortal, who have a &s;eparate row of teeth longer than others. The Arabs, in Egypt, are acquainted with the formation of the teeth of the&s;e reptiles; and handle freely tho&s;e &s;erpents, from which they have taken out, with pincers, the long teeth, which &s;erve as a channel to the poi&s;on. In Arabia, the only &s;erpent truly dreadful is, that called Batan; very &s;mall, and delicately made, with black and white
<PB N="97" REF="100">
&s;pots. Its bite is in&s;tant death; and &s;wells the corps of the per&s;on bit, in an extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>In our pa&s;&s;age up the Red Sea, we &s;aw great quan|tities of flying fi&s;h; which ro&s;e, from time to time, above the &s;urface of the water. But we di&s;covered no flying &s;erpent; though the Arabs give this name to a &s;erpent, which &s;hould rather be called a &s;pring|ing one. This &s;erpent fa&s;tens him&s;elf by his tail, to the low branch of a tree; then giving a &s;udden jerk, by means of the ela&s;ticity of his tail, he &s;prings up, from one branch to another, till he reaches the top.</P>
<P>The Arabians di&s;tingui&s;h &s;everal kinds of locu&s;ts, to which they give particular names; but their names do not regard the nature of the animal, but the pre|tended delicacy of its fle&s;h. They give the name of <HI>Muken</HI> to that &s;ort which is looked upon the fatte&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ucculent; they eat al&s;o another, which is thin and meagre; but they refrain entirely from that called <HI>Dubba,</HI> becau&s;e it brings on a diarrhaea.</P>
<P>All the Arabs, not only tho&s;e that live on the bor|ders of Per&s;ia, but tho&s;e in Syria and Africa, are ac|cu&s;tomed to eat locu&s;ts; the Turks, on the contrary, have an aver&s;ion to this kind of food, If Europeans expre&s;s the &s;ame di&s;like, the Arabs reproach them for eating oy&s;ters, crabs and lob&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101">Swarms of this in&s;ect darken the air, and ap|pear a-far like a thick &s;moke. The noi&s;e they make, as they fly, is dreadful; it &s;tuns the ears like the fall of a great river. When &s;uch a &s;warm alights on a country, it is laid wa&s;te, and &s;tripped of its verdure. The vegetables, and date-trees, &s;uffer very much from the locu&s;ts; but the corn that is ripe, or nearly &s;o, is left un-touched, from its being too hard for them to eat.</P>
<P>A little in&s;ect, about the &s;ize of a barley-corn, is another &s;courge to Arabia, as well as to mo&s;t hot countries. Many writers have, from its re&s;emblance, taken this creature for an ant. Its in&s;tinct leads it to walk out only in the night, under &s;ome kind of galleries, which it builds up with earth as it ad|vances; when got to the end of its march, it de&s;troys and devours every thing; victuals, cloaths and furniture. We found, &s;ays <HI>Nicuburk,</HI> an army of the&s;e in&s;ects in our chambers, at Beit el Fakih, when they had built up their galleries, which we imme|diately de&s;troyed; but without being di&s;couraged, or even frightened, at the &s;ight of us, they patched up their work, during the night, with &s;ingular per&s;e|verance; &s;o that we had an infinite deal of trouble to get rid of this little animal, which lives and works in &s;ociety, like the ants.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">The Arda is another in&s;ect very dangerous to trees who&s;e leaves, or fruit, their &s;weetne&s;s makes them fond of. The&s;e in&s;ects fa&s;ten their galleries, on &s;uch kinds of trees, from the bottom to the top. The in|habitants have no other means of &s;ecuring their gar|dens, from a total deva&s;tation, than by &s;urrounding the trees with &s;heep's dung; the &s;mell of which is in&s;upportable to this in&s;ect.</P>
<P>There are a great number of ants in Arabia, mo&s;t of which are as harmle&s;s as our own. We mu&s;t, how|ever, except two kinds; one of which is trouble&s;ome, from the voracity with which it attacks the provi&s;ions of the Arabs, if not driven away by the &s;mell of cam|phire; the bite of the other is almo&s;t as painful, as that of the &s;corpion.</P>
<P>A kind of <HI>Scolopendre</HI> is al&s;o very tormenting to the inhabitants, by cau&s;ing burning pains to tho&s;e it attacks. This in&s;ect fa&s;tens it&s;elf into the fle&s;h, with all its feet, in &s;uch a manner, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be freed from it, but by &s;ucce&s;&s;ively burning, with hot iron, all the parts of the animal.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Cities.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal cities in Arabia, of which we pro|po&s;e to treat, are, Suez, &s;ituated in the Nor|thern part of Arabia; Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, in the province of Hedsjas; and Loheia, Sana and Mocha, &s;ituated in the Yemen, or &s;outhern part of Arabia.</P>
<P>Suez, which was the Ar&s;inoc of the ancients, is &s;itu|ated at the top of the Red Sea; it &s;tands &s;urrounded by the de&s;art, and is a &s;habby ill-built place: the &s;hips anchor a league from the town, to which, the channel that leads is very narrow, and has only nine or ten feet depth of water; for which rea&s;on the large &s;hips, that are built here, mu&s;t be towed down to the roads, without ma&s;ts, guns, or any thing in them; &s;ome of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are, at lea&s;t, twelve hun|dred tons burthen, being as lofty as an hundred gun &s;hip, though not longer than a frigate. Eight of the&s;e &s;hips &s;ail every year to Jeddah, before the Hadji, &s;tay
<PB N="101" REF="104">
there two or three months, and return loaded with coffee: this is &s;o material an article, in the diet of a Mu&s;&s;ulman, that the prayers and wi&s;hes of them all are offered up for its &s;afety; and, next to the lo&s;s of their country, the lo&s;s of their coffee would be mo&s;t &s;everely felt by them; the greate&s;t part of it is &s;ent to Con&s;tantinople, and other parts of Turkey.</P>
<P>The town, &s;ays <HI>Nieuburk,</HI> is &s;ituated on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Arabian gulph, or Red Sea; but not quite at its extremity. It is not &s;urrounded with walls; the hou&s;es, however, are &s;o well joined together, that there is no entering the city, but by two &s;treets; one of which, that towards the &s;ea, is open; and the other &s;hut in by an old ruinous gate. The hou&s;es are very indifferent, and the Khans are the only &s;ub&s;tantial buildings, There are &s;carce any remains of the ca&s;tle built by the Turks, on the ruins of the ancient Kolgum.</P>
<P>It is badly peopled. Among the inhabitants are &s;ome Greeks, and a &s;mall number of Copts; but, at the &s;ea&s;on of the departure of the &s;hips for Jeddah, the concour&s;e of &s;trangers, collected there, is very great.</P>
<P>The country round about is nothing but rocks, &s;lightly covered with &s;and, which renders it &s;o very
<PB N="102" REF="105">
barren, that &s;carce any vegetation is to be &s;een; trees, gardens, fields and meadows are entirely unknown. The only article; of food, which is in any plenty, is fi&s;h. All other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for men or cattle, is brought from a great di&s;tance, from Cairo three days, or from Ja&s;&s;a, &s;ix days journey.</P>
<P>There is not a &s;ingle &s;pring of fre&s;h water in Suez. The only water, that is drinkable, is brought from a place about two leagues from the town, on the other &s;ide of the gulf. It is the Arabs who bring this water, which they &s;ell very dear. The principal occupation of the inhabitants is the building of &s;hips. This bu|&s;ine&s;s is in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate, in &s;pite of the dear|ne&s;s of wood, iron, and other materials, which are all brought from Cairo on camels. The government of this town is under the influence of the Turks.</P>
<P>Between this town and Tor is a place called Bur|kit Pharoon, &s;ignifying <HI>Pharach</HI>'s whirlpool. This has been determined to be that part of the Red Sea which <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> cro&s;&s;ed, as related in the bible, when pur&s;ued by <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> who, they &s;ay, was drowned, in that very &s;pot, where this eddy is. The Arabs have &s;till a cu&s;tom, when they pa&s;s this place, to kill a &s;heep, which they &s;moke with incen&s;e, after cutting off its head, and then throw it into the &s;ea, praying at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="106">The government of Suez is under the influence of the Turks. The governor is appointed by the pacha of Grand Cairo. The Arabs, who live near Tor, on the other &s;ide of the gulf, pay little regard to the Turki&s;h governor of Suez. When they are di&s;&s;atis|fied with him, or the inhabitants, they threaten to bring no more water, and forbid any one to go near the well. The putting this threat into execution would reduce the town to the greate&s;t extremity; they therefore do every thing to pacify them. They might ea&s;ily ruin the town, if they did not prefer the advantage they derive from the tran&s;port of merchan|dize, on their camels, between Suez and Grand Cairo.</P>
<P>We our&s;elves, &s;ays <HI>Nieuburk,</HI> experienced the effects of the in&s;olent threats of the&s;e Arabs. The Scheiks who had conducted us to Mount Sinai, not having fulfilled their engagements, we refu&s;ed to pay them all the money we agreed to give them. They threatened to kill us; we told them we would defend our&s;elves. They then &s;aid they would cut off the &s;upply of water; we replied that was indifferent to us, who drank only wine; an an&s;wer which made the Turks laugh, at the Arabs' expence. But, after having intere&s;ted the tribe to take part in their quarrel, the execution of this threat was &s;o much dreaded, that the governor entreated us to &s;ettle the the difference by paying the Scheik.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="107">Every per&s;on, whether Chri&s;tian or Mahometan, who travels along the coa&s;t of Arabia Petraea, either by &s;ea or land, &s;hould take with him a Gha&s;ir, or guide, to whom he mu&s;t make &s;ome little pre&s;ent, from time to time; as al&s;o at the end of his journey. By the&s;e means he will travel through the country, without danger of being mole&s;ted. If the ve&s;&s;el, on which he embarks, &s;hould be &s;hipwrecked, it will be plundered by the Arabs; but his goods, or merchan|dize, will be re&s;tored to him immediately, if his Gha&s;ir is pre&s;ent. If the traveller names one who is ab&s;ent, a circle will be drawn round them, and they will be kept till he comes; and, then, in&s;tantly tran&s;|mitted to him. But if the traveller has no Gha&s;ir, or if he gives in a fictitious name, his effects will be &s;eized upon, without hearing any thing he has to &s;ay. The Turks, through avarice, in order to &s;ave &s;ome little pre&s;ent, and out of pride not to be thought to familiarize with the Arabs, very &s;eldom take any Gha&s;irs; but they &s;uffer by this neglect. For the rights of this kind of ho&s;pitable friend&s;hip are &s;acred among the&s;e robbers.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay of Jeddah, &s;ays <HI>Rooke,</HI> that it is <HI>terra &s;enza frutti &amp; populo &s;enza fede,</HI> I believe I give a pretty ju&s;t de&s;cription of it; but to enter into a more minute one, it is an old and ill built town, &s;urrounded by a broken and ruinous wall, having no &s;ort, nor
<PB N="105" REF="108">
any guns mounted; it is &s;ituated nearly mid-way, be|tween Mocha and Suez, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the Red Sea, and is a place of the greate&s;t trade on it; the commerce, between Arabia and Europe, here meets, and is interchanged; the former &s;ending her gums, drugs, coffee, &amp;c. which are brought in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, from the whole extent of the coa&s;t, as far as Ba&s;&s;ora, in the Per&s;ian gulph; and from Europe come cloths, iron, furs, and other articles, by way of Cairo: the revenue, ari&s;ing from the duties on the&s;e, is &s;hared between the Grand Signior, and the Scheriff of Mecca; to whom this place ju&s;tly belongs. It was formerly tributary to the Grand Signior only; but the latter, who&s;e dominions &s;urround it, &s;eized on it; the affair, however, being compromi&s;ed between them, they now &s;hare the profits of the port; the for|mer &s;ends annually a Pacha, to &s;upport his preten|&s;ions, and collect the revenue; the latter deputes a governor, who is termed the Vizir-Scheriff, and has chief power and authority here.</P>
<P>This town, like Suez, is entirely without fre&s;h water. The inhabitants have none to drink, but what the Arabs collect in their re&s;ervoirs in the moun|tains; which they bring, by little and little. on their camels, into the city. The environs are a deep &s;and, and very barren. According to tradition, the&s;e parts have experienced no change &s;ince the creation of the

world; for, in a place a little di&s;tant from the &s;ea, they &s;till &s;hew the tomb of Eve. In walking about the harbour, &s;ays <HI>Nieubuhr,</HI> I was witne&s;s to the very &s;ingular manner in which the Arabs take their wild fowl. The fowler undre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, puts &s;ome &s;ea-weed on his head, and walks towards the bird, who is not frightned at the approach of the &s;ea-weed, which he is accu&s;tomed to &s;ee floating on the waves. The Arab then &s;eizes the duck by the feet. When <HI>Pocock,</HI> and other travellers, mentioned this method being practi&s;ed in China, their relation was not cre|dited. Nothing is, however, more certain.</P>
<P>The people here are not quite &s;o black as they are farther South, having a yellowi&s;h tinge in their com|plexions; their way of living, however, is much the &s;ame: they &s;it cro&s;s-legged on the ground at their meals; watch, pray, drink coffee, and &s;moke hookah five times in the day. There are &s;everal coffee-hou&s;es which are always full; the common people there drink their di&s;h of coffee together, as ours would a pot of beer, at an alehou&s;e. The women &s;eem to have rather more liberty than at Mocha, many of them may be &s;een walking about the &s;treets; but the appearance they make is very extraordinary: tho&s;e of middling rank wear loo&s;e cloth trow&s;ers, and yel|low huzzar-boots, have veils of white linen over their faces, reaching almo&s;t to the ground, with only
<PB N="107" REF="110">
two &s;lits for the eyes, and wrap them&s;elves in a large loo&s;e plaid of coar&s;e cloth; they have a variety of gold and &s;ilver trinkets round their arms and legs, and wear necklaces of &s;mall pieces of money &s;trung; all the&s;e make a jingle, like bells, as they walk: through one of their no&s;trils they wear a ring, with a &s;lat plate on it, like a coat button, and dye their hands red, with a herb that grows in the country; they are as fond of &s;moking hookah as the men; and, when they vi&s;it, always take it along with them.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, among the men, is not unlike that of the Turks. They wear their &s;hirt over loo&s;e trow&s;ers, made of linen. The <HI>jambea,</HI> a kind of concave hanger, is fa&s;tened to a large girdle; a wai&s;tcoat, the &s;leeves of which fit clo&s;e, is covered with a very large mantle. The twi&s;t, which hangs to the handle of the dagger, has a kind of coral &s;u&s;pended to it, with which the Arabs amu&s;e them&s;elves, &s;ays <HI>Nieubuhr,</HI> to keep their fingers em|ployed. They are unacquainted with the u&s;e of &s;tockings; and wear nothing about their feet, but half-boots, or &s;lippers.</P>
<P>The women of fa&s;hion are dre&s;&s;ed nearly as the Turks are at Cairo; but the common people wear only a &s;hirt, without breeches. The Bedouins have nothing but a long piece of linen, which they wrap
<PB N="108" REF="111">
round their wai&s;t. The women, among the lower cla&s;s, wear nothing but a long &s;hift, hanging loo&s;e; and veil. In the&s;e three articles con&s;i&s;ts the whole of their dre&s;s. We have given a plate of one of the&s;e women &s;elling bread. Her fan is made of a kind of mat, compo&s;ed of leaves of the palm-tree interwove, and a para&s;ol of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Being near the fountain-head of their faith, the people here are great bigots to their religion, and, of cour&s;e, inveterate enemies to the Chri&s;tians; any &s;tranger, of that cla&s;s, is &s;ure of being in&s;ulted in the &s;treets, unle&s;s he has a guard with him; they are not allowed to go out of the gate leading to Mecca.</P>
<P>Eve's &s;epulchre is a white building, which &s;tands about a quarter of a mile North of the town; the Arabs &s;ay &s;he was certainly buried there, and that her grave is twenty feet in length, which they determine to have been the &s;tandard height of mankind, at that early period of the world; the two Arabic words &s;ig|nifying Eve, the mother of all, are in&s;cribed on the building; they go every &s;abbath to pray there, but will not &s;uffer a Chri&s;tian to vi&s;it it. The two mo&s;t valuable productions of this country are, balm of Gi|lead, and &s;enna, &s;ays <HI>Rooke;</HI> the former is extracted from a tree which grows among&s;t the mountains, the latter is a &s;hrub found near Mecca.</P>

farther up the country, however, towards the moun|tains, very fine fruits are to be &s;een in great abun|dance. During the &s;ummer months, the heats are in|tolerable at Mecca; the inhabitants, to &s;hade them|&s;elves, &s;hut the blinds of their windows very care|fully, and water the &s;treets, in order to cool the air.

<P>As a great part of the nobility, of the province of Hedsjas, lives here, it is better built than any other city of Arabia. Among the fine edifices it contains, the mo&s;t remarkable is the famous <HI>Kaba,</HI> or hou&s;e of God, which was held in veneration, even before the time of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould have been curious enough to have &s;een this extraordinary building, &s;ays <HI>Nieubuhr,</HI> but no Chri&s;tian is permitted to go to Mecca, not that there is any expre&s;s law to the contrary, or that the more enlightened Mahometans have any thing to object again&s;t a curio&s;ity of this &s;ort; but, on account of the prejudices of the people, who, looking upon this as holy ground, think the Chri&s;tians unworthy to &s;et their foot there: it would be profaned, in the opinion of the &s;uper&s;titious, if it was trodden upon by infidels. The people even imagine, that Chri&s;tians are pre|vented
<PB N="111" REF="115">
from approaching it by a &s;upernatural power. They relate, that an infidel, on his arrival at the hills which &s;urround Mecca, was attacked by all the dogs of the city, who came out on purpo&s;e; and that, &s;truck with this miracle, and the augu&s;t a&s;pect of the Kaba, he turned Mahometan.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t pre&s;ume then, that all the Europeans who have de&s;cribed Mecca, from ocular te&s;timony, have been renegado's who e&s;caped from Turkey. A recent in|&s;tance &s;upports this opinion. On the promi&s;e of being able to pre&s;erve his religion, a French &s;urgeon was per&s;uaded to accompany the Emir Hadji, as his phy|&s;ician. But, at the fir&s;t &s;tation, they obliged him to be circumci&s;ed, and then permitted him to continue his journey.</P>
<P>Although the Mahometans do not permit the Eu|ropeans to go to Mecca, they do not object giving them de&s;criptions of the Kaba. There are painters who get their livelihood, by making &s;mall paintings of the Kaba, and &s;elling them to the pilgrims.</P>
<P>To judge from the&s;e drawings, the kaba is a very in&s;ignificant building; a kind of &s;quare tower, who&s;e top has a covering of black &s;ilk thrown over it, em|broidered with gold. This covering is made at Ka|hira; and a new one, as we have already ob&s;erved in
<PB N="112" REF="116">
our account of Turkey, is &s;ent every year by the Grand Signior. The gutters of this building, are of pure gold. What &s;eems mo&s;t magnificent in this holy building, are the arcades which &s;urround the place where the kaba is &s;ituated. The Mahometans &s;peak with admiration of the great quantity of gold and &s;ilver lamps, and chandeliers, contained in the&s;e ar|cades. Yet, according to the&s;e accounts, which are probably exaggerated, the riches to be found in the kaba, are much inferior to tho&s;e di&s;played in many of the Catholic churches.</P>
<P>The kaba contains a mo&s;t venerable and extraor|dinary relic; this is the famous black &s;tone, brought by the angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> for the con&s;truction of the holy hou&s;e. According to the mufti's, when this &s;tone arrived, it was entirely white, and &s;o brilliant, that it dazzled the eyes at the di&s;tance of four days journey; but it wept &s;o much, and &s;o long for the &s;ins of men, that it became opaque, and at la&s;t quite black. Every mu&s;&s;ulman, when he walks round the kaba, mu&s;t ki&s;s, or at lea&s;t touch, this compa&s;&s;ionate &s;tone. The &s;ame honours are not paid to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;tone, nor to that of <HI>I&s;hmael.</HI> Pilgrims are di&s;pen&s;ed with from vi&s;iting and ki&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The Arabs venerate the kaba, becau&s;e it was built by <HI>Abraham,</HI> and &s;erved as a hou&s;e of prayer for him.
<PB N="113" REF="117">
In the &s;ame precincts, is the well of Zemzem, e&s;teemed for the excellence of its water, and honoured on account of its miraculous origin. <HI>Hagar,</HI> turned out of doors by her ma&s;ter, &s;et down the little <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> on this &s;pot, while &s;he went to a fountain, to get &s;ome water for her &s;on, who was dying with thir&s;t.

<P>A range of bra&s;s columns, which go round the kaba, &s;erve farther as an ornament to it. Chains run be|tween the pillars, which &s;upport a multitude of &s;ilver lamps. The portico's, or arcades, above mentioned, are intended to &s;erve as a &s;hade to the pilgrims during the violent heats in the day-time. A farther u&s;e is made of them; the merchants, who follow the caravans in great numbers, di&s;play their merchandize under the&s;e arcades.</P>
<P>The Mahometans have &s;o great an opinion of the &s;anctity of Mecca, that they extend it to the environs. The territory of this town is reputed &s;acred, to cer|tain di&s;tances, which are pointed out by particular marks. Each caravan finds, on its route, one of the&s;e marks, which is an indication to the pilgrims to put on

<P>At one day's journey, di&s;tant from the harbour of Jambo, is Medina, a city of a middling &s;ize, &s;ur|rounded with bad walls, and &s;ituated in a &s;andy plain. It belongs to the Scheriff. Before the time of <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> this city was called Jathreb; but it had the name of <HI>Medinet en Nebbi,</HI> or city of the prophet, given to it, after <HI>Mahomet,</HI> on being driven from Mecca, took refuge there; and, in this city, he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his days.</P>
<P>The tomb of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> at Medina, is re&s;pected by the mu&s;&s;ulmen; but they are not obliged to vi&s;it it, in order to pay their devotions to the tomb. The cara|vans of Syria and Egypt, which, on their return from Mecca, pa&s;s near Medina to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I had, &s;ays <HI>Nieubuhr,</HI> a drawing of the great mo&s;que, in which the tomb is &s;een in one corner. As it was feared the people might render a &s;uper&s;titious homage to the &s;poils of the prophet, iron nails are placed round the tomb, through which it may be &s;een. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;imple ma&s;onry, in the form of a che&s;t, without other monument. I could not, &s;ays the above writer, learn what gave ri&s;e to the ridiculous &s;tory, well known in Europe, of the large pieces of adamant
<PB N="115" REF="119">
which &s;upported <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s tomb in the air. This tomb is placed between two others, in which repo&s;e the a&s;hes of the two fir&s;t califs. Although it is not more magnificent than mo&s;t of the founders of mo&s;ques, the building which covers it, is enveloped on the out&s;ide with a covering of green &s;ilk, embroidered with gold, which the pacha of Dama&s;cus exchanges for a new one, every &s;even years.</P>
<P>The building is guarded by forty eunuchs, in order to prevent the trea&s;ure being taken away, which is &s;aid to be contained there. This trea&s;ure, made up chiefly of pre&s;ents from the Turki&s;h nobles, is looked upon as very con&s;iderable; but &s;o many ab&s;urd &s;tories are blended with this account, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to know what to think. Many very re&s;pectable Maho|hometans have a&s;&s;ured me, as a fact, that among other valuable trea&s;ures belonging to this tomb, one is the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, or a large quantity of powder which converts all metals into fine gold.</P>
<P>The mountainous part of the province of Hedsjas, between Mecca, is divided among a number of inde|pendent Scheicks. During the months proper for pa&s;turage, the per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank in the&s;e tribes, live under tents in &s;ummer, and remain the re&s;t of the year in towns and villages. But the people commonly live in little huts covered with ru&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120">The mo&s;t remarkable &s;tate, and the lea&s;t known, is that which the Jews have formed to the North-ea&s;t of Medina.

<P>This e&s;tabli&s;hment has, perhaps, given ri&s;e to the fable of the Sabbatic river. The&s;e Jews, not tra|velling on the &s;abbath, cannot follow the caravans. The country they inhabit is, however, &s;urrounded with &s;uch exten&s;ive de&s;erts, and &s;o very un&s;afe, that, without joining &s;ome caravan, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to go out of a country &s;o <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;,</HI> or to get into it.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="121">
having a fort at each extremity. The circuit of the wall is two miles. There are &s;everal hand&s;ome mo&s;ques in the city; but that with the tower, built in honour of <HI>Shadeli,</HI> who founded the town, and brought the coffee-plant into the neighbourhood, is the principal one.

<P>Trade has much declined here of late years, &s;ince Europe has been &s;upplied with coffee from the We&s;t-Indies, which article is the &s;taple commodity of this country; it grows at a place called Betelfaqui, about &s;ixty miles from hence, and is brought to Mocha on camels; that patient and docile animal, in the&s;e Ea&s;tern countries, &s;hares with man in his toil, and tran&s;ports his merchandize from place to place; he kneels down at the command of his ma&s;ter, to receive his load, and carries it with a &s;low and &s;teady pace acro&s;s the dry and barren de&s;arts, &s;upporting thir&s;t for &s;everal days together; nor is this animal u&s;eful only for the purpo&s;es of carrying a rider, or his burden, but it likewi&s;e &s;upplies man both with food and raiment.</P>

crimes to drink out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, with one of another <HI>ca&s;te,</HI> or religion; they never eat of any ani|mal, nor kill even a fly.

It appears more populous than it is in reality, as the gardens oc|cupy a con&s;iderable part of the &s;pace within the town. There are only twelve public baths at Sana, but there are a great number of magnificent palaces; the three fine&s;t of which were built by the pre&s;ent Imam.</P>
<P>The architecture of the Arabic palaces, bears no re|&s;emblance to ours. They are, however, built with bricks or &s;tone, cut or &s;haped in the &s;ame manner.

They have &s;carce any window-frames. In&s;tead of windows, they, in general, have &s;hutters, which they open in fine weather, and &s;hut, when it rains. In this latter ca&s;e, there is a &s;mall hole at the upper part of the &s;hutter, &s;illed up with Mu&s;covy gla&s;s, through which the light enters. Some of the Arabs have &s;mall painted windows which they get from Venice.</P>
<P>There is at Sana, as in all the towns of the Ea&s;t, large khans for travellers. Every kind of merchan|dize has its particular market. None but women are to be &s;een in the bread-market, who have portable &s;hops, or &s;tands. It is the &s;ame with all other trades, where the bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on in &s;imilar buildings in the open &s;treet. The writers have portable &s;hops, where they tran&s;cribe their papers, copy books, and give le&s;&s;ons in writing to their pupils. There are al&s;o markets, where old cloaths may be exchanged for new.</P>
<P>Timber, is in general, very dear in the Yemen; wood for burning, is no le&s;s &s;o at Sana. As all the mountains are barren, the wood comes at the di&s;tance of two or three days journey, &s;o that a camel's load commonly co&s;ts about two crowns. This &s;carcity is &s;upplied by charcoal; they have al&s;o turf, but it is &s;o had that it mu&s;t be mixed with &s;traw, in order to make it burn.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="127">Fruits, on the contrary, are in great profu&s;ion at Sana. There are more than twenty different kinds of grapes, which ripening one after another, furni&s;h a delicious refre&s;hment for many months. The Arabs hang them up in their cellars, and make them la&s;t almo&s;t the whole year. The Jews make a &s;mall quan|tity of wine, and might make &s;till more for commerce, if the Arabs were not &s;uch enemies to &s;trong liquors. A Jew, convicted of having carried wine to an Arab, is &s;everely puni&s;hed. He mu&s;t even be cautious in &s;ending it to one of his own per&s;ua&s;ion. They dry a great quantity of grapes, and it forms a con&s;iderable article of exportation.</P>
<P>The Jews are not permitted to live in Sana, they inhabit a village a-part, to the number of two thou|&s;and. In the Yemen, they are treated with more contempt, than even in Turkey. They are the be&s;t workmen the Arabs have. The&s;e people are per|mitted to go into the city in the day-time, where they work in little open &s;hops; and, at night, return to their village.</P>
<P>The Imam lives in great &s;tate at Sana; he has a numerous &s;tud of very fine hor&s;es, and his &s;eraglio is compo&s;ed of one hundred and fifty women: in this ble&s;&s;ing of life, people in the Ea&s;t may indulge them|&s;elves to what extent they plea&s;e, there being no limi|tation

to the number of concubines, though only four wives are allowed; the &s;eraglios are, therefore, com|monly in proportion to the wealth of the ma&s;ter, their concubines being &s;laves whom they purcha&s;e. Their idea of beauty, as may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, differs as much from ours as their colour; the more jetty black the complexion of the female, the more &s;he is admired; flat no&s;es and thick lips are con&s;idered hand&s;ome; and, therefore, the women of Aby&s;&s;inia, which country is oppo&s;ite to this coa&s;t, having the&s;e perfections in the highe&s;t degree, fetch the greate&s;t price in the market; numbers of them are brought here, and &s;ent to the other parts of Arabia, every year for &s;ale.</P>
<P>The throne of the Imam of Sana, who&s;e dominions may be &s;aid to comprehend the greate&s;t part of the Yemen, is hereditary. His revenues are e&s;timated at about 500,000 crowns a month. They ari&s;e from im|po&s;ts on lands, per&s;ons and goods. Coffee is the lead|ing article of his revenue; this is taxed a fourth part of its value before it is exported. It is remarkable, that <HI>Pliny</HI> notices the ancient cu&s;tom of the Arabs, to grant their &s;overeign a duty, amounting to the va|lue of the fourth part of their productions. His army con&s;i&s;ts of about four thou&s;and infantry, and one thou|&s;and cavalry.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="129">In time of peace, the &s;ervice of a &s;oldier in the cavalry, is confined to the taking care of his hor&s;e, and accompanying the Imam, or, if in the provinces, the governor, to the mo&s;que. The Arabs take very great care of their hor&s;es, each of which has its par|ticular groom. They leave the heads of their hor&s;es free, and fa&s;ten them by the legs very near the ground, which prevents their being vicious. After the &s;oldiers have conducted the Imam from the mo&s;que, they pur|&s;ue each other with lances, and this is all their mili|tary exerci&s;e. As the lands in the Yemen are very cold, they immediately put coverings over their hor&s;es, which they leave upon them, till they are mounted again.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the men have al&s;o &s;ome civil employment, which they follow, when they are not taking the field. They are armed with lances and &s;abres, and &s;ome of them carry pi&s;tols in the hou&s;ings of their &s;addles. But they wear no uniform, each per&s;on dre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf according to his fancy.</P>
<P>In the garri&s;on, the infantry is ju&s;t as idle; they &s;eldom mount guard, except &s;ome few &s;entinels at the gates of the towns. The infantry al&s;o accompany the governor to the mo&s;que, marching in rank and file, with men preceding them, who are cutting capers, with their arms in their hands, and &s;inging like &s;o
<PB N="126" REF="130">
many madmen. On their return from the mo&s;que, the&s;e foot-&s;oldiers &s;alute the governor with &s;ome di&s;charges of mu&s;quetry, made without any regula|rity; and this ceremony is the only exerci&s;e they have.</P>
<P>The infantry is &s;till wor&s;e cloathed than the cavalry; mo&s;t of the &s;oldiers are contented with &s;imply wrapping &s;ome linen round their wai&s;t, and a handkerchief about their head; the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed wear a &s;hirt, and breeches of blue cloth.</P>
<P>The Arabs have an extraordinary manner of &s;hew|ing their courage, re&s;embling the manner in which the ancients devoted them&s;elves to death. The per&s;on who wi&s;hes to give proofs of his attachment to his ma&s;ter, ties up one of his legs behind, and con|tinues firing till the enemies retire, or he him&s;elf is killed. I looked upon this as a &s;tory, having no foun|dation in truth, &s;ays <HI>Nieubuhr,</HI> until I was undeceived in the recent in&s;tance, which I found might be de|pended on, of a Scheik, in the &s;ervice of the Imam, who devoted him&s;elf in this manner, in an engage|ment again&s;t his countrymen. Six &s;laves loaded the fu&s;ils of this Scheik, who kept a continual fire upon the enemy; until, after being abandoned by the Iman's troops, and his own dome&s;tics, he was ma&s;&s;acred.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="131">They have no artillery in their armies; the Arabs know not how to make u&s;e of cannon; &s;o that their cannoniers, which they have in &s;ome of their towns, are renegado's, or fugitive Turks, who have never been thoroughly taught this art.</P>
<P>The Imam having nothing to fear from enemies, or pirates, in the Red Sea, has no need of a navy. His &s;ubjects are, in general, bad &s;ailors. The fi&s;her|men di&s;play a courage and dexterity, in hazarding them&s;elves at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, in &s;mall &s;loops, without &s;ails, and, in a manner, without oars.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the natural talents of the people, the arts, for want of encouragement, are entirely neg|lected in the territories of the Imam, and in the ad|joining provinces. Books are rare, the Arabs not being fond of printed characters. They have no painters nor &s;culptors, it being contrary to the pre|cepts of their religion, to &s;uffer the imprint of any image. Nor have they any mu&s;ical in&s;truments, ex|cept drums and reeds, in the country of the Yemen. Their gold and &s;ilver work is well executed, but the workmen are either Jews or Banians.</P>

<P>HAVING, in our de&s;cription of Syria and Pa|le&s;tine, given an account of the Bedouin Arabs inhabiting the vallies and frontiers of tho&s;e two pro|vinces; we &s;hall conclude our de&s;cription of Arabia, with &s;ome intere&s;ting ob&s;ervations on the manners and cu&s;toms of the Arabs in general; a people hitherto but little known, and which are extracted from the wri|tings of <HI>Abb&eacute; Poiret,</HI> in his late travels through part of that country.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I paint, &s;ays the <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> the confu&s;ed and contradictory ideas which aro&s;e in my mind, on the fir&s;t view of the&s;e Arab hordes? I had approached within half a gun-&s;hot of thirty tents, and was pre|paring to go up to them, when I was informed that the plague had ju&s;t made its appearance among them. To avoid the danger of communication, I di&s;mounted

from my hor&s;e. The &s;pot where I then happened to be, was on the brink of a-rivulet, the &s;tream of which was cool, and perfectly limpid; bu&s;hes of ro&s;es, lau|rels, and myrtles, formed around me an agreeable &s;hade; and the land&s;cape, bounded by hills, clothed with the mo&s;t beautiful verdure, was animated by nu|merous herds feeding at a di&s;tance, Thus nature, by pre&s;enting this delightful view, tran&s;ported me, in idea, to tho&s;e happy ages, when men were all &s;hepherds, and knew no other riches than their flocks, and the productions of the earth. Occupied with the&s;e ideas, whil&s;t wandering over the beauties of this &s;cene, and fixing my &s;ight principally upon the low &s;moky huts of the Arabs, I &s;aw, all of a &s;udden, about a dozen of them, directing their &s;teps towards me. I confe&s;s, at the &s;ight of the&s;e ferocious men, I could not &s;uppre&s;s an emotion of fear; which, in an in&s;tant, di&s;pelled all tho&s;e ideas with which I had been &s;o agreeably entertained. They were armed, and I ap|prehended &s;ome attack from them; but the Arabs who accompanied me, a&s;&s;ured me there was no danger. As &s;oon as they were near enough, I &s;aluted them ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the country, and ordered my interpreters to tell them to keep at a certain di&s;|tance, on account of the contagion. With this re|que&s;t they readily complied, and &s;quatting down in a circle round us, conver&s;ed with their countrymen for &s;ome time. They then a&s;ked me, if I would have

I drank &s;ome of it, and, notwith&s;tanding their forward manner and threatening air, was &s;en&s;ible they gave me a kind re|ception. I expre&s;&s;ed my gratitude by my ge&s;tures, and di&s;tributed among them a &s;mall quantity of powder and &s;hot, which they reque&s;ted. Forgetting then the picture which had been drawn to me of their man|ners, I endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that the nearer a man is to nature, the better he ought to be. I perceived in them the patriarchs of antiquity, de|voted entirely to the care of their flocks, and free from that multiplicity of wants created by luxury. I beheld men, to whom I was indebted for their ho&s;pi|tality, &s;ince they offered me an a&s;ylum in their tents; and, if I did not find in them the affected politene&s;s of Europe, I thought I ob&s;erved, at lea&s;t, that ru&s;tic openne&s;s, that ought to re&s;ide in the man of na|ture.</P>
<P>When I took leave of the&s;e Arabs, they accom|panied me near half a mile; and when we parted, they wi&s;hed me, in their own language, happine&s;s and peace. Being informed of the meaning of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, I repeated them very affectionately, and congratulated my&s;elf, that the fir&s;t Arabic words which I pro|nounced, &s;erved to expre&s;s my gratitude; I met with

almo&s;t the &s;ame reception, &s;ays the <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> from the dif|ferent Arab tribes, among whom I went.</P>
<P>In this de&s;art and uncultivated country, how many enjoyments, and what riches for the naturali&s;t! How many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for the philo&s;ophical ob&s;erver! How humiliating it is for human nature, to &s;ee almo&s;t all nations degenerate in&s;en&s;ibly from the virtue of their ance&s;tors, and pre&s;erve only their vices! This, however, is the picture which the hi&s;tory of all ages pre&s;ents to us. Where, at pre&s;ent, &s;hall we find the &s;ages of Greece, the learned Egyptians, and the heroes of ancient Rome? We &s;hould in vain &s;eek for them in their de&s;cendants; while the A&s;iatic has pre&s;erved his primitive effeminacy, and the barba|rous African &s;till thir&s;ts after blood. How many figures, worthy of exerci&s;ing the pencil of a <HI>Raphael,</HI> are to be met with among the Moors and Arabs! Eyes full of fire and courage, a ferocious look, manly and &s;trange features, an aquiline no&s;e, nervous arms, a tall figure, a haughty gait, legs, thighs, and &s;houlders almo&s;t always naked, are the characteri&s;tic marks which di&s;tingui&s;h the greater part of them.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s is an intere&s;ting object, and believed to be very ancient. It is &s;aid, that in &s;ome parts of the de&s;art, &s;everal of the tribes go perfectly naked. I have, indeed, met with &s;ome, &s;ays the <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> who had
<PB N="132" REF="140">
no kind of ve&s;tment whatever; and others, who had a kind of light drawers; but the greater part wear a dre&s;s, more or le&s;s &s;imple, according to their wealth and condition. Some, 'I mean the poorer &s;ort,' wrap them&s;elves up in a piece of linen cloth, &s;everal yards in length, which they roll, each according to his own manner, around the head and body. This dre&s;s is perfectly well de&s;cribed by <HI>Fenelon,</HI> when, &s;peaking of the cu&s;toms of the Boeotians, in his <HI>Telemaehus;</HI> he &s;ays, "Their dre&s;&s;es are ea&s;ily made; for in that mild climate, nothing is worn but a piece of fine light &s;tuff, uncut, which they wrap round their bodies in long folds, giving it whatever form they chu&s;e. Others add below either a &s;hirt, like tho&s;e of our women, or a tunic of woollen cloth, without &s;leeves, which reaches as far as their knees. The riche&s;t wear, be&s;ides this, a kind of robe, much like the cloaks of the hermits. The finene&s;s of their dre&s;s is al&s;o proportioned to their fortune. I have &s;een &s;everal Arab chiefs clad in woollen &s;tuffs, which, on the fir&s;t view, I have taken for very fine mu&s;lin, of an exceeding bright white colour." The Barbary wool, has always been famous for its beauty. The women, for their dre&s;s, wear a piece of &s;tuff like that of the men, but they arrange it &s;omewhat differently. They make a kind of robe of it, which covers &s;everal of tho&s;e parts that the men leave naked. Be&s;ides this, the Arab women wear &s;e|veral ornaments, which certainly do not contribute to
<PB N="133" REF="141">
&s;et off their beauty. They wear their hair in tre&s;&s;es, and &s;ometimes floating over their &s;houlders; while the men are &s;haved, and re&s;erve only one tuft in the middle of their head. The ears, arms, and legs of an Arab woman, are ornamented with large iron rings; &s;ometimes they add bits of coral. Coquettes, after their own manner, in&s;tead of rouge, which certainly would add very little embelli&s;hment to their dark complexions, u&s;e gunpowder mixed with antimony, for tracing out various figures on their foreheads, and above the eye-lids. The men do the &s;ame on their arms, brea&s;ts, and hands; a little &s;uper&s;tition is, per|haps, mixed with the&s;e my&s;tical characters. If, to &s;upply tho&s;e colours which they want, our European ladies were obliged to &s;ubmit to an operation, as pain|ful as that employed by the Arabs, it may be much doubted, whether they would wi&s;h for any other charms than tho&s;e be&s;towed by nature. The female Arabs, to render the&s;e marks indelible, prick their &s;kins in numberle&s;s places with a needle, and when the blood cea&s;es to flow, they apply their powder, finely pound|ed, and force it into the pores of the &s;kin, by repeated friction.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s, which has been de&s;cribed, is, indeed, common among the wandering Arabs of the moun|tains, and the de&s;arts. Tho&s;e, who live in cities, vary more in their manner of dre&s;&s;ing. Some go with
<PB N="134" REF="142">
their heads bare, or covered at mo&s;t with a red bon|net; others wear a turban like the Turks, with part of their accoutrements. They u&s;e &s;lippers too, but the mountaineers go always bare-footed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are fond of antiquities, might make curious and u&s;eful re&s;earches re&s;pecting the dre&s;s of the African and A&s;iatic Arabs. What induces me, &s;ays <HI>Poir&eacute;t,</HI> to believe it is very ancient, is, that the&s;e people are ab&s;olutely ignorant of a variety of modes. A &s;on never thinks of dre&s;&s;ing any other|wi&s;e than his father; and even if he &s;hould, their in|du&s;try is &s;o limited, that their workmen would find them&s;elves much embarra&s;&s;ed, were they obliged to change the form of their dre&s;s, however trouble&s;ome it might be.</P>
<P>The habitations of the Arabs are as &s;imple as their dre&s;s; they inhabit only tents or huts, con&s;tructed with the branches of trees and reeds. A collection of &s;everal tents, is called a <HI>douare:</HI> there are &s;ome which contain from ten to twenty, and even above a hundred. The&s;e tents are placed circularly, in order that they may inclo&s;e their flocks in the middle, during the night. If there be any vacant &s;pace between two tents, they fill it up with bu&s;hes and thorns, to ex|clude ferocious animals. The form of each tent is almo&s;t like that of a tomb, or of the keel of a ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="135" REF="143">
rever&s;ed. They are low, except tho&s;e of their chiefs, which are exten&s;ive, and have a little more elevation. The cloth of which they are compo&s;ed is of wool, very clo&s;ely woven, and dyed either black or brown. The facility with which the&s;e habitations are tran&s;|ported, makes the Arabs often change their abode, according to the &s;ea&s;on, or as their wants may re|quire. In winter, they choo&s;e a Southern expo&s;ure, at the bottom of &s;ome hill; in &s;ummer, they approach tho&s;e places where there are plenty of pa&s;tures, and abundance of &s;prings.</P>
<P>An inventory of their furniture may be &s;oon taken. They are acquainted with no other bed than the earth, upon which the mo&s;t delicate &s;pread a little &s;traw, a mat, or a coar&s;e carpet. A few earthen ve&s;&s;els for cooking, and to prepare their <HI>courcou&s;an;</HI> a wooden ba&s;on to draw water, and to hold their milk, when they milk their cows; a goat's &s;kin to churn their but|ter, and two portable mill-&s;tones to grind their corn, are all the apparatus of their kitchens.</P>
<P>From this enumeration of their kitchen uten&s;ils, it may readily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that their repa&s;ts are neither &s;umptuous nor delicate; indeed, nothing can be more &s;imple or frugal. They make only one meal a day, which requires any preparation. Be&s;ides this, they take nothing, or el&s;e they content them&s;elves with
<PB N="136" REF="144">
&s;ome fruit, or a few wild roots. Tho&s;e, however, who are in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, eat two meals a day, which con&s;i&s;ts only of <HI>courcou&s;an.</HI> It will be proper to ob&s;erve, that the wheat in the northern part of Arabia does not, like that in Europe, produce a pure and nutritive flour; but, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h in the grain, the mealy part from that which is hard. The fir&s;t, which is in a very &s;mall quantity, is gene|rally found at the point of the grain and in the middle. This flour makes very bad black bread; and, on this account, it is never u&s;ed. They give it their cattle, or mix it up in &s;mall quantities with the part which is hard. The Arabs are unacquainted with the u&s;e of bread. They brui&s;e their wheat by means of two portable &s;tones, &s;o that it forms a coar&s;e kind of meal, which they call <HI>courcou&s;an.</HI> When they are de&s;irous of preparing a repa&s;t, they heap up a quantity of this meal, in a ve&s;&s;el full of &s;mall holes, and place it by way of a covering upon the pot, in which they boil their fle&s;h, &s;o that the vapour which ari&s;es, penetrates the meal, and makes it &s;well. When this operation is fini&s;hed, they take out the <HI>courcou&s;an,</HI> and put it into another large flat ve&s;&s;el, &s;upported by a foot like that of our drinking gla&s;&s;es. This food &s;erves them in&s;tead of bread; and when they eat it, they mix it with a little &s;oup, milk, butter, or honey. Above the <HI>courcou&s;an</HI> they place their roa&s;t meat, which every
<PB N="137" REF="145">
one tears to pieces with his fingers; this is generally beef, mutton, fowls, or goat's fle&s;h.</P>
<P>When the <HI>courcou&s;an</HI> is prepared in this manner, the chief of the tent, or any other Arab, of a rank &s;upe|rior to the re&s;t, lays hold of the di&s;h, and eats fir&s;t, and alone. He &s;its &s;quatting down, places the <HI>courcou&s;an</HI> before him, and, having taken a little with his fingers, forms it into &s;mall balls in the hollow of his hand, and throws it into his mouth with much dexterity. When the chiefs have done, the di&s;h pa&s;&s;es into the hands of tho&s;e who are next in dignity: to children, for ex|ample, who never eat with their father, nor even in his pre&s;ence, unle&s;s among Arabs of a certain di&s;|tinction. The women eat la&s;t; they have nothing but what is left by the men, and even what is left by their own children. They alone have the charge of providing the&s;e repa&s;ts. According to the principles of their religion, the Arabs are obliged, both before and after meat, to wa&s;h their hands, beard, and mouth; but many neglect this ceremony. As Mahometans, they have nothing to drink but water, drawn up with a wooden ba&s;on, from which they all drink in their turns. However, they do not refu&s;e wine when it is offered to them, if they are not &s;een. Many of them are even known to drink to exce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="146">When the Arabs undertake long journies, and in places in which it is probable they will meet with no ho&s;pitality, they carry with them a certain quantity of their meal; and when they are pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, make a few balls of it with water, in the hollow of their hand. This &s;light nouri&s;hment &s;uffices, and &s;upports them during very long cour&s;es.</P>
<P>There are other Arabs, who&s;e way of living is &s;till more wretched and mi&s;erable. The&s;e are the un|conquered hordes, who inhabit &s;pots inacce&s;&s;ible. They have no fixed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or place of abode. If they &s;ometimes &s;ow a &s;mall portion of land, and if they keep flocks, as they are then obliged to &s;ettle in the plains, they never fail to be robbed. The&s;e wretched people, therefore, retire to the thick impe|netrable woods, to frightful defiles between the moun|tains, or to caverns in the rocks. They live &s;eparate, one from the other, and are obliged, as we may &s;ay, to nouri&s;h them&s;elves with the gra&s;s of the field. Wild fruits, tender roots, and the young &s;hoots of plants &s;up|ply them with food. The greater part have fire-arms, which are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t valuable inheritance that a father can leave to his &s;on. They might employ them in hunting, but as they find it very difficult to procure powder and &s;hot, they keep them to defend their liberty. They prefer independence and mi&s;ery to a more tranquil life, which they could not enjoy in

many parts of Arabia; but, by &s;ubmitting like the re&s;t of their countrymen to the government of the Turks. The&s;e Arabs are the mo&s;t cruel of all, and &s;o eagerly do they thir&s;t after human blood, as to make it ea&s;ily be believed that there are canibals among them. No one dares to penetrate into the defiles of their moun|tains. The &s;overeigns of the country have, &s;ome|times, carried thither con&s;iderable armies; but their enterpri&s;es have always mi&s;carried. Either the troops have been cut to pieces in the narrow pa&s;&s;es, or the Arabs have di&s;per&s;ed and taken &s;helter in the interior parts of their mountains. Sometimes they de&s;cend to the level country, and plunder the neighbouring na|tions. Their figure is horrible; they are lank and meagre, covered with rags, and di&s;gu&s;ting on account of their dirtine&s;s. They never attack travellers, ex|cept when in large bodies; but, as they live at a di&s;|tance one from the other, when a traveller makes no &s;tay among them, and does not give them time to a&s;&s;emble, he may pa&s;s in many places without danger.</P>
<P>Though half &s;avage, in appearance, the Arabs have certain received &s;igns to expre&s;s friend&s;hip and re|&s;pect.&mdash;Signs, which among them have as little &s;in|cerity as among us. The mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;alutation, when the Arabs meet, is to put the right-hand on the brea&s;t, and to incline the head; and in this po&s;ture to wi&s;h

each other a good day. They enquire afterwards, concerning the health of their relations, naming them in order, and do not forget to a&s;k re&s;pecting the mare, the flock, the tent, &amp;c. If they are Arabs who are acquainted, they embrace one another reciprocally ki&s;&s;ing each others face and &s;houlders, or they only lay hold of each other's hands, and ki&s;s one another. Tho&s;e among whom an intimate familiarity &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, when they meet one another, frequently do nothing but touch the extremity of each other's fingers, after which each puts his own to his mouth and ki&s;&s;es them.</P>
<P>When the Arabs acco&s;t any per&s;on of dignified rank, &s;uch as a chief, a bey, or a kaidi, they ki&s;s their hand with great re&s;pect. A mark of favour, on the part of the great man, is to pre&s;ent the palm of his hands to the &s;ubjects who come to render him homage, and whom he wi&s;hes to di&s;tingui&s;h from others; ge|nerally he pre&s;ents only the back part of his hand. In &s;hort, as a greater mark of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they ki&s;s his head, his &s;houlders, his turban, and his cloaths. There are &s;ome, even, who pro&s;trate them&s;elves, by placing one knee on the earth. An Arab never approaches a great man, without pulling off his flippers.</P>
<P>When two Arabs meet on the highway, they &s;alute each other, and a&s;k all the que&s;tions above men|tioned.
<PB N="141" REF="149">
without &s;topping, and even when pur&s;uing their journey in different directions: hence, it often happens, that they are too far a&s;under to be under|&s;tood, when they have got to the end of their que&s;|tions. This, however, does not prevent them from going on.</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation, their ge&s;tures are lively, graceful, and expre&s;&s;ive. When we &s;tudy them with atten|tion, it is not difficult to comprehend the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e. Their accent is &s;trong and &s;harp, and the &s;ound of their voice is &s;onorous, and may be heard very far. Their being habituated to live in the open fields, and to &s;peak to one another at a great di&s;tance, makes them acquire, from infancy, a cu&s;tom of &s;peaking very loud.</P>
<P>The Arabs do not affix to eructation the &s;ame idea of ru&s;ticity and indelicacy, as do the Europeans. On the contrary, when any one belches or &s;neezes, they offer up vows for his health. They &s;ay <HI>&s;aha,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies, <HI>may it do you good.</HI> They u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion upon many other occa&s;ions. When any of them eats, drinks, or &s;mokes, they &s;ay to him <HI>&s;aha,</HI> a compli|ment much ju&s;ter than that u&s;ed by us, when we drink to any one's health.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150">When the Arabs are at re&s;t, their u&s;ual po&s;ture is not cro&s;s-legged, like the Turks; they &s;it &s;quatting, with their fuzee upright between their knees; for they never quit their arms, except when in their tents. In this manner they pa&s;s whole days in doing nothing; and con&s;ider them&s;elves exceeding happy, when they can give them&s;elves up to this idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The only method of travelling commodiou&s;ly, in this country, is to have a tent to ones &s;elf, &s;ays <HI>Abb&eacute; Poiret,</HI> and to lay in a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ions; but &s;ometimes this precaution is impo&s;&s;ible. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, a traveller mu&s;t be contented to put up with the tents of the Arabs, dirty and di&s;gu&s;ting as they are; but above all, he mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf to their coar&s;e and unpalatable food. How often mu&s;t he de|part in the morning, without knowing where he will arrive in the evening! How oft, lo&s;ing him&s;elf in the&s;e de&s;arts, mu&s;t he &s;earch out his way amid&s;t thorny brakes, thick fore&s;ts, &s;teep rocks, and burning &s;ands; &s;ometimes &s;topped by a river, which he mu&s;t wade through, by a lake which he mu&s;t walk round, or by a mar&s;h which he cannot cro&s;s without danger; &s;ometimes &s;corched by the &s;un&punc; or drenched by the rain, and at others dying with thir&s;t, without being able to find the &s;malle&s;t &s;pring to quench it! If he carries no provi&s;ions with him, it will be impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould get any refre&s;hment before night. This
<PB N="143" REF="151">
is the only time at which the Arabs make a regular repa&s;t, or can offer any food to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>But, when night arrives, that period of repo&s;e for travellers in Europe, it is not &s;o here. He mu&s;t then choo&s;e out a dry &s;ituation, and well &s;heltered to erect his tent; he mu&s;t un&s;addle his hor&s;es, unload his mules, cut wood, light fires, and take every precaution that prudence directs to protect him&s;elf again&s;t ferocious animals and robbers. It is &s;afe&s;t to encamp not far from the tents of the Arabs, when they can be found. They furni&s;h many &s;uccours when they are tractable; and they are always &s;o, when they &s;ee a per&s;on with a &s;ufficient guard.</P>
<P>It is on the bare ground, or at mo&s;t covered with a mat, that the Arabs repo&s;e; and, it is thus that the traveller mu&s;t re&s;olve to pa&s;s the night, unle&s;s he be provided with a mattra&s;s; which, however, he mu&s;t renounce, when he meets with much rain. Be&s;ides, as all his luggage is incommodious, it will be better to adopt at fir&s;t the cu&s;tom of the Arabs, to which one mu&s;t come either &s;oon or late.</P>
<P>There are a multitude of national prejudices, re|marks the <HI>Abb&eacute;</HI> very ju&s;tly, that one cannot get rid of without having been engaged in &s;uch journies as the&s;e. All civilized nations re&s;emble one another.

The characteri&s;tic marks which di&s;tingui&s;h them, are act &s;ufficiently prominent to ob&s;erve them; we mu&s;t have a delicacy and acutene&s;s of judgment far above the common. Every nation, without doubt, has its peculiar character, cu&s;toms and manners, but they are all guided by common principles; and all, more or le&s;s, enlightened by the arts and &s;ciences, endeavour to unite around them the conveniences and comforts of life. Among&s;t a poli&s;hed people, genius, ever active and lively, is continually inventing and bringing &s;ome|thing to perfection: it embelli&s;hes the habitation of man, and converts to his u&s;e the productions of na|ture; but the&s;e boa&s;ted conveniences, the&s;e events of &s;ocial life, are &s;o many bonds, which render man a &s;lave to a number of fictitious wants; and make him an unhappy being, when his riches or labour cannot &s;upply them. Accu&s;tomed from infancy to enjoy the&s;e advantages, we believe them to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our exi&s;tence, that to procure them, we forget the labour, the fatigue, and the pain which they co&s;t us. We exhau&s;t our &s;trength, de&s;troy our health, and &s;acri|fice our mo&s;t valuable moments to the acqui&s;ition of a fortune, which often e&s;capes from us; and even on the brink of the grave, we &s;till form grand projects, in the hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a fal&s;e happine&s;s, which death in a moment &s;natches from us.

<P>Experience has undeceived me. I not only know tho&s;e men, whom I thought &s;o wretched, but I have re&s;ided among them, and lived in the &s;ame manner. I followed their cu&s;toms at fir&s;t through nece&s;&s;ity, and afterwards adopted them from habit. They eat no bread; they are ignorant of the art of cooking vic|tuals, and water is their only drink. But what is the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">equence? They are more healthy, more robu&s;t, and di&s;ea&s;es are uncommon among them. They have no hou&s;es; but in this happy climate a piece of can|va&s;s, a hut covered with leaves, or the hollow of a rock, is &s;ufficient in the wor&s;t weather, to defend one from the injuries of the air. They &s;leep in their clothes, and often amid&s;t moi&s;ture. Would it not, therefore, appear they mu&s;t be attacked by that croud of di&s;|tempers with which medicine threatens tho&s;e in Eu|rope who &s;hould attempt the &s;ame thing? I was a little frightened, when I found my&s;elf obliged, for the fir&s;t time, to repo&s;e in an Arabian hut; I &s;lept well, but finding my clothes wet when I awoke, I was ap|prehen&s;ive for my health. Luckily I felt no other in|convenience than that of having my &s;ides a little &s;ore: but this was of no con&s;equence; they were &s;oon ac|cu&s;tomed to the hard earth for a bed, as well as my head to my &s;addle, for a pillow. With a little cu&s;|tom,

one &s;leeps as &s;oundly in this manner, as in a bed &s;urrounded by curtains. Sleep, which then never ex|ceeds the bounds pre&s;cribed by nature, diffu&s;es the bal&s;am of health through all the organs. Re&s;piration becomes more lively, and we &s;eem animated by a new exi&s;tence, which one would regret to lo&s;e by too much indulgence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, at the moment when one awakes, there is another plea&s;ure which few can appreciate, becau&s;e few know how to enjoy the beauties of nature. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;ilent de&s;arts, when the morning ap|pears, the horizon glows with its ruddy light, and its rays gild the &s;ummits of the di&s;tant mountains. By little and little, the plains are illumined, &s;urrounding objects appear di&s;tinctly, the flowers expand, and &s;cent the gale with their perfume; the birds &s;hake their plumage, and &s;alute the new day; and, in a moment, all nature is enlivened, and every where pre&s;ents the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pects. The goat is &s;u&s;pended on the projecting rocks; the ox crops his food in the verdant mead; the lamb bleats by the &s;ide of its mo|ther; and the whole country becomes a true picture of pa&s;toral life. The&s;e are plea&s;ures unknown to tho&s;e who can &s;leep only in &s;ome gloomy alcove.</P>

No people can be more wretched than the&s;e women. Their hu&s;bands are real de&s;pots, who ex|erci&s;e the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority over them, and treat them with the utmo&s;t contempt. Marriage here, re|marks the <HI>Abb&eacute;</HI> again, is not a contract which requires even the con&s;ent of both parties. It is a bargain, con|cluded between the parents of the woman, and the per&s;on who intends to e&s;pou&s;e her. In order to ob|tain her, he has no need to win her heart, or merit her good graces; for, if he pre&s;ents him&s;elf with one or two beautiful cows, well fed, he is certain of being favourably received. The parents keep the cows, and deliver over their daughter in their &s;tead. Whether &s;he is to be happy, or unhappy, is not their bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;he is &s;old. If &s;he di&s;plea&s;es her hu&s;band, he &s;ends her back to her parents, and purcha&s;es another, or even &s;everal, as we have above remarked. If the re|pudiated woman happens to plea&s;e another, &s;he will co&s;t him le&s;s; as &s;he has before had another hu&s;band.</P>

butter, all belong to the women; but this is the ea&s;ie&s;t part. Whil&s;t the men pa&s;s their lives in idlene&s;s, they leave to the women the &s;evere&s;t labours. It is they who cut wood, and who, with great fatigue, carry it on their &s;houlders.

It is they, al&s;o, who often &s;ow and till the earth. Their hard&s;hips, however, are &s;till greater, when it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pull up the poles of their tents. The hu&s;|band mounts his hor&s;e very peaceably, without any other incumbrance except his arms; while the wife walks on foot, loaded with kitchen furniture, and &s;ometimes with the tent, when there is no animal to carry it. The hu&s;band often has the cruelty to beat her very &s;everely, when in &s;uch a &s;ituation &s;he is not able to keep up with his hor&s;e. Thus is &s;he obliged to travel acro&s;s burning &s;ands, having nothing either often, to eat or to drink.</P>
<P>The &s;lave, rather than the companion of her hu&s;|band, &s;he can expect from him neither tenderne&s;s nor affection.

Several of them wa&s;h their children as &s;oon as they are born, and wrap them up in the corner of their robe; in other re&s;pects, they abandon them to nature, and allow them nothing but what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their exi&s;tence. When &s;carcely brought to bed, the&s;e women re&s;ume their labours; to which is added, that of feeding their children.

The&s;e women never have their faces covered, though they ought to u&s;e veils, to hide their ugline&s;s, rather than to conceal their beauty. Their complexion is like &s;oot; their &s;kin is dry and parched, and their whole body is painted with different fanta&s;tical figures. Scarce have they pa&s;&s;ed the bounds of infancy, when the &s;igns of premature old age appear on their coun|tenances. They are early deformed by wrinkles; but it is ea&s;ily perceived, that they are only the effects of forced labour and misfortune, and not the ravages of years. The attracting graces of youth have not time to di&s;play them&s;elves; and, from infancy to old age, there is &s;carcely any gradation. Dead eyes, a ca&s;t-down and di&s;ordered look, hollow cheeks, a back bent by exce&s;s of labour, &s;igns of the greate&s;t mi&s;ery in the whole external appearance, dejection, heavi|ne&s;s, and the mo&s;t gloomy melancholy, form the por|trait of the greater part of the Arab mountaineers.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Education.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Abb&eacute; Poiret,</HI> re&s;pecting the education of the Arabs, will, perhaps, not prove unacceptable to our readers. I was &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;ays this writer, to find a public &s;chool in one of their <HI>douares;</HI> and &s;till more &s;o, to find it under the direction of a per&s;on who was blind. This Arab collected in his tent, about a dozen children of both &s;exes, whom he taught to read and write. I ob&s;erved, that their countenances bore no marks of wearine&s;s or di&s;gu&s;t, which are too common in our &s;chools of Europe; labour, on the contrary, appeared
<PB N="153" REF="165">
to them like amu&s;ement. They had only one book, the <HI>koran,</HI> which the ma&s;ter knew by heart; and, on that account, he was able to follow his &s;cholars, and to correct them, when they went wrong. They chaunt|ed their le&s;&s;ons, each with good humour, and in a different tone; and, though this mu&s;ic was not very engaging, I &s;aw, with plea&s;ure, that, among the&s;e &s;a|vage hordes, the infancy of man is not abandoned to cruel and mercile&s;s tyrants, who often bla&s;t the ri&s;ing flowers of genius at an early period of life. The farthe&s;t advanced taught the younger branches to write, under the direction of the ma&s;ter. In&s;tead of paper, they had pieces of board covered over with a kind of varni&s;h; a bit of reed, cut in a very rude man|ner, &s;upplied the place of a pen; and yet, with this coar&s;e apparatus, they wrote well, and with great expedition. When they had thoroughly learned their ta&s;k, they wa&s;hed their tablets, upon which ano|ther was written; and this always &s;ome &s;entence from the <HI>koran.</HI> As &s;oon as the time of their remaining in &s;chool was expired, each child embraced the ma&s;ter, (who treated them with great mildne&s;s and affability,) and returned him thanks for his attention. How re|ver&s;e is &s;uch a treatment, from that of one of our &s;urly pedagoues, who knows no other plan, but that of in|&s;piring children with &s;entiments of fear and di&s;gu&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="166">In the greater part of what are called civilized na|tions, children &s;carce come into the world, before they are dre&s;&s;ed out like puppets. They are made to repeat by rote, a few Latin lines; they are taught, above all, to behave with politene&s;s; that is to &s;ay, to di&s;&s;emble and lie; and they are afterwards whipped, for the&s;e faults, when their parents them&s;elves are the fir&s;t victims of their own folly. Among the Arabs, the ca&s;e is quite different: children there are entirely abandoned to nature; they are &s;eldom care&s;&s;ed, and never beaten. Left to them&s;elves, they are employed only in exerci&s;es &s;uited to their age: they run, &s;port, quarrel, and become friends; the mo&s;t ardent heat does not intimidate them; dampne&s;s and cold never hurt them; they throw them&s;elves into the water, when covered with &s;weat, and never &s;it down till they have quenched their thir&s;t. They can &s;carcely walk, when they accompany their fathers, to watch their flocks; mount on the back of the fierce&s;t bull, and learn, without bridle, and without &s;purs, to manage the mo&s;t untractable cour&s;er. Familiar with every animal, they care&s;s the &s;heep, play with the goat, and, in clo&s;e pur&s;uit, follow the ox, which e&s;capes. By the&s;e exerci&s;es, in which they delight, and to which they are never compelled, they become nimble, vigo|rous, and robu&s;t; and are enured to that kind of life for which they are de&s;tined.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="167">They are accu&s;tomed early to bear hunger, thir&s;t, and the mo&s;t laborious journeys, without complaining. Their parents do not &s;poil them, by &s;edulous and mi|nute attention. An over tender mother, never runs to wipe the &s;weat from the dirty forehead of her &s;on; if he complains, he is not heard; and if he cries, &s;he is in&s;en&s;ible to his tears, which are never the means of obtaining what he de&s;ires. He is never prevented from doing what he chu&s;es, but his parents never humour his caprice. If he wi&s;hes for any thing, he mu&s;t procure it him&s;elf; if he cannot, he mu&s;t give it up, and remain contented. He never a&s;ks for any thing; he &s;earches for it; and, by this, he accu&s;toms him&s;elf to &s;uit his de&s;ires to his &s;ituation. But this want of complai&s;ance on the part of the parents, and this kind of independence in the children, do not e&s;ta|bli&s;h, between father and &s;on, tho&s;e gentle bands, and that tender relation, which, to feeling hearts, are the highe&s;t enjoyments of life. As soon as children can &s;upport them&s;elves, without the help of tho&s;e to whom they owe their exi&s;tence, they often abandon them; and they become afterwards, &s;trangers to one another. Their common fate gives them little concern, unle&s;s they are united by reciprocal intere&s;t; affection for parents, is, therefore, a &s;entiment almo&s;t unknown to the heart of an Arab; a brother is often an enemy to a brother; and the ties of blood, which are thought
<PB N="156" REF="168">
to be &s;o &s;trong among mankind, are here of little force.</P>
<P>With regard to the real character of children, it is the &s;ame in Arabia, as el&s;ewhere. Some of them, as in Europe, are eager, lively, full of &s;pirits, and of petu|lance: their rea&s;on, though never cultivated, is much forwarder th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n that of children in Europe. Among&s;t us, a boy of twelve or thirteen, &s;carcely knows how to &s;peak before people older than him&s;elf. He is timid, ba&s;hful, and dull. On the other hand, the young Arab, wandering in the open plains &s;urrounded by tents, herds, and flocks, and enjoying in full liberty, all the plea&s;ures of youth, the bounties of nature encrea&s;e his ideas, even with the objects of his delight. As he is re&s;trained by no dread, nor checked by any &s;en&s;e of decency, he &s;peaks his &s;entiments in a firm and manly tone, without being in the lea&s;t aba&s;hed. If he wi&s;hes to be heard, he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of at|tracting the attention of tho&s;e to whom he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf; otherwi&s;e, he receives no reply. If he a&s;ks que&s;tions, none of them are an&s;wered, but as they de&s;erve it; but, at the &s;ame time, if what he &s;ays appears to be ju&s;t, he is heard with attention, and treated as a man; and this mark of di&s;tinction in|&s;pires him with the de&s;ire of acting like one. Thus, without much trouble, without ma&s;ters, and without tutors, the young Arab, formed by nature, early ac|quires
<PB N="157" REF="169">
tho&s;e ideas which relate to his occupation; as well as that vigour and noble carriage which an|nounce the dignity of man. Their ge&s;tures are not &s;tiff, but natural; and their pace is neither too quick nor too &s;low. It is firm and manly; but it is only during infancy, that the Arabs can follow the dictates of nature. Their mild and &s;imple manners, gradu|ally de&s;troyed by brutal prejudices, by the &s;angui|nary di&s;po&s;itions of their fathers, corrupted by the &s;hameful irregularities to which they abandon them|&s;elves, totally di&s;appear; and the blood-thir&s;ty &s;avage is &s;ub&s;tituted to the man of nature.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t prejudices, in&s;tilled into a child, is an implacable hatred again&s;t all chri&s;tians; and this idea becomes &s;o &s;trengthened by age, that there is not a &s;ingle Arab, who does not con&s;ider it a meritorious action, to deprive one of life I have been, &s;ays <HI>Abb&eacute; Po&iuml;ret,</HI> often greatly harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e children, who flocked round me, as I approached the tents; and I was even under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting up with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ults I received from them. Had I attempted to have corrected any of them, their fathers would not have failed to have taken their part, and to have revenged, at my expence, an injury done by a dog, to a &s;ervant of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="170">The Arabs hate us, at pre&s;ent, without knowing the rea&s;on why, remarks the <HI>Abb&eacute;.</HI> Their ance&s;tors, however, knew it well. The mo&s;t unju&s;t wars, to which fanatici&s;m gave the name of <HI>holy,</HI> carried on, both in Africa and the Ea&s;t, incen&s;ed again&s;t us im|men&s;e nations; who, at that time, had done no other hurt, than that of following the religion of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whil&s;t we followed that of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> The&s;e enterprizes were the cau&s;e of &s;hedding much blood, and termi|nated by drawing upon us, from the offended nations, a ju&s;t hatred. The name of <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> has always con|tinued to be execrated in all the different countries of the Levant, in Syria, Arabia, Per&s;ia, Armenia, Egypt, Barbary, &amp;c. Fathers have tran&s;mitted this hatred to their children. In pa&s;&s;ing from one generation to another, the cau&s;e has been forgotten, but the hatred has remained. It is thus that we pay, at pre&s;ent, for the faults committed by our ance&s;tors, more than &s;ix hundred years ago.</P>
<P>I have many times &s;een &s;ome of the women, who had never met a Chri&s;tian, &s;hudder when I appeared, and fly from me, as if I had been a mon&s;ter. How|ever, by means of &s;ome little pre&s;ent, I always ren|dered them more tractable; and when I had familiar|ized them &s;o far that they ventured to look at me, they appeared a&s;toni&s;hed when they found me like another man. Several of them could not be per&s;uaded I was
<PB N="159" REF="171">
a Chri&s;tian; they particularly examined my gloves, which were green, taking that to be the colour of the &s;kin. When I pulled them off, they were in the ut|mo&s;t amazement. Every attempt that I made to ex|plain their utility, was in vain; for, as the&s;e people are acquainted only with what is nece&s;&s;ary, they laugh at all &s;uperfluities. They think them&s;elves &s;uperior to us, becau&s;e they have fewer wants; and, indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, they are in the right. How often, by their raillery, have they given me u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons! I was accu&s;tomed, when I eat of their <HI>courcou&s;an,</HI> to u&s;e a &s;poon, in&s;tead of forming it into balls with my fingers, like them. They laughed much at this &s;uper|fluous piece of furniture, which &s;elf-love made me re|nounce; and I perceived, that, notwith&s;tanding my awkwardne&s;s in u&s;ing my fingers, they e&s;teemed me more, when they &s;aw I abandoned my own cu&s;toms to adopt theirs. Thus are all the commodities, &s;o much boa&s;ted of in Europe, treated in the de&s;art. In the eyes of an Arab mountaineer, luxury is contemptible; and the &s;tronge&s;t proof to him of our meanne&s;s, is our effeminacy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arabs follow, in a rude manner, the reli|ligion of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> They intermix it with many &s;uper&s;titions; and, attached to certain external ceremonies, &s;eem to be ignorant of its real &s;pirit. They ob&s;erve very &s;trictly the Ramadan, the Beiram, prayer, ablution, and circumci&s;ion; but few of them, however, ab&s;tain from wine.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who, under the title of <HI>Papas,</HI> wear chaplets, hanging from their necks, compo&s;ed of large beads, and who pre&s;ide at religious ceremonies, &s;uch as prayer, marriages, funerals, &amp;c. but the people can readily di&s;pen&s;e with their &s;ervices. They em|ploy their chaplets, as in Roman Catholic countries, to count the number of their prayers; and every time they drop a bead from their fingers, they &s;ay, <HI>How great is God! There is only one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</HI> In this exclamation, and rai&s;ing their
<PB N="161" REF="173">
thoughts towards God, all their prayers con&s;i&s;t. The&s;e prayers they repeat wherever they may be; on a journey, in the mid&s;t of their labour, and in the &s;ilence of retirement. They pronounce their words with a &s;trong empha&s;is, as if animated with &s;ome lively &s;en|&s;ation, and &s;truck with the maje&s;ty and beneficence of the Deity. Their manners, however, are quite con|trary to the&s;e ideas.</P>
<P>Ablution, among the Arabs, is not ob&s;erved in &s;o rigorous a manner, as among the Turks. It is &s;uf|ficient, if they wa&s;h &s;ome part of their bodies, &s;uch as the arms, hands, feet, vi&s;age, and beard, which they generally do in the morning, in the evening, and after meals. Several of them neglect this practice; but they are more attentive to their prayers, which they every where repeat. Wherever they may be, whether in the tents, or in the fields, they throw them&s;elves on their knees, cover their heads with their clothes, pro&s;|trate them&s;elves three times on the earth, ri&s;e up, and kneel down, alternately, pronouncing each time, "How great is God! <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his prophet." During the Ramadan, which continues one moon, they take no food till after &s;un-&s;et; and they even ab&s;tain from water, and from &s;moking. They &s;uffer their hair to grow, and neither wa&s;h their clothes, nor &s;have their beards; they even affect to appear covered with filth and dirt. They do the &s;ame when they lo&s;e a near
<PB N="162" REF="174">
relation, or when they have the death of any one to revenge.</P>
<P>To the Ramadan &s;ucceeds the Beiram, which con|tinues &s;everal days. The Arabs then dre&s;s them&s;elves in their be&s;t clothes, &s;have their beards, and indulge in diver&s;ions and fea&s;ting. Different tribes vi&s;it each other reciprocally, and all enmity &s;eems to be forgot|ten: but only during this fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>The return of the new year is al&s;o a fe&s;tival, u&s;hered in with entertainments, con&s;ecrated to joy and plea&s;ure. On the evening before new year's-day, as well as upon every other grand fe&s;tival, tho&s;e who are appointed to invite the people to prayer, call out much longer, and with a louder voice, than at other times, as grand &s;olemnities are announced among us by a greater number of bells.</P>
<P>The extravagant follies, to which the Arabs give them&s;elves up at that &s;ea&s;on, though different, have &s;ome re&s;emblance to a Carnival. The mo&s;t common farce con&s;i&s;ts in &s;preading out a lion's &s;kin over the &s;houlders of four Arabs, concealed under a large car|pet, which reaches to their legs. This fanta&s;tic lion has a long chain about his neck, and is led by another Arab. Several others play on a tabor and flute; whil&s;t the lion, and &s;ome dancers, perform very gro|te&s;que
<PB N="163" REF="175">
dances; others covers them&s;elves with the &s;kin of a camel, in&s;tead of the &s;kin of a lion. In this di&s;|gui&s;e they enter every hou&s;e, to which they can find acce&s;s, followed by a croud of the populace, and, above all, children, who bear in their hands the figures of a camel, and a lion. They receive &s;ome pieces of money, from every per&s;on in who&s;e hou&s;e they have exhibited their dances.</P>
<P>The laws of ho&s;pitality are held &s;acred among the Arabs; at lea&s;t, among tho&s;e who are under the di|rection of a chief. The Mahometan &s;tranger, who arrives among them, is received with apparent cor|diality; he is pre&s;ented with <HI>courcou&s;an,</HI> and is intro|duced into a tent, to repo&s;e, during the night. Were he the mo&s;t avowed enemy, when he is once admitted into the <HI>douare,</HI> he has &s;eldom occa&s;ion to fear trea|chery. This, however, is not that generous and re|&s;pectable ho&s;pitality, which, formed among the an|cient patriarchs, as well as among the Romans, the &s;weete&s;t bonds of fraternal friend&s;hip; which brought together &s;trangers of all countries, and which honoured humanity by anticipating their wants. The Arabs re&s;pect the life of their gue&s;t, whil&s;t he is in their tents; but, if they have re&s;olved to de&s;troy him, they wait until he has left the <HI>douare;</HI> they then ma&s;|&s;acre, without pity, him, whom the evening before they treated as a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="176">The &s;y&s;tem of prede&s;tination, &s;o generally adopted by the Mahometans, renders the Arabs almo&s;t indiffe|rent with regard to whatever may befall them. They never complain of their &s;ituation; each is contented with his own: &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent, they forget the pa&s;t, care little for the future, and con&s;ider death as a nece&s;&s;ary event, to which they &s;ubmit without mur|muring.</P>
<P>Have their flocks and tents been carried away?&mdash;Are they threatened by &s;ome great danger, per&s;ecuted by their chief, or driven from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions?&mdash;Amid&s;t the greate&s;t misfortunes, they make u&s;e of no other expre&s;&s;ion but this, <HI>God will have it &s;o.</HI> I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Poiret,</HI> &s;ome of them, who, when cited by their &s;overeigns, to appear before them; and, when almo&s;t certain of being &s;acrificed to their avarice, departed with a&s;toni&s;hing compo&s;ure. If any emotion of fear aro&s;e in their &s;ouls, the idea of prede&s;tination pro|duced a calm, and &s;ilenced the voice of nature. It is al&s;o to this comforting prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that they are in|debted for that indifference, with which they behold the plague exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t ravages among&s;t them. How often have I &s;een them, during this de&s;tructive contagion, wait for death without the lea&s;t emotion; di&s;charge all the duties of humanity to tho&s;e who were in&s;ected, cleans their ulcers, inter the dead; and, without any precaution, put on the clothes of tho&s;e who had peri&s;hed by this cruel ma|lady!
<PB N="265" REF="177">
They are not, however, ignorant of the dangers of communication; but they de&s;troy every objection by the&s;e words, <HI>My de&s;tiny is written; God will have it &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>The Arabs, however, do not give to prede&s;tination the &s;ame extent that we do. They apply it only to phy&s;ical events, and &s;eldom to moral actions. They believe in free-will; and, rather attached to the exte|rior rites of their religion, give them&s;elves up to the ferocity of their character, without &s;eeming to reflect on the morality of their actions. Hence ari&s;e a multitude of fal&s;e deductions and incon&s;i&s;tencies, which are not &s;urprizing in a nation rude and ignorant; and hence, tho&s;e numerous errors in the relations of travellers, who have re&s;ided only for a &s;hort time among tho&s;e people, who&s;e manners they wi&s;hed to de&s;cribe. Whoever, for example, newly landed upon their coa&s;ts, &s;hould advance towards the infected tent; whoever &s;hould have &s;een the father of a fa|mily di&s;tribute, without a tear, to his wives and chil|dren, the cloth which was to wrap up their bodies after death; and the latter receive it with a &s;toic tran|quillity, would, undoubtedly, imagine him&s;elf trans|ported into a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers; e&s;pecially if he &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the fe&s;tivals, dances, and public marks of joy which they exhibit, amid&s;t the ravages of the plague. What would he think, on &s;eeing a &s;on
<PB N="166" REF="178">
di&s;charge towards his father, the la&s;t duties of huma|nity; and, without con&s;idering the danger of contact, take the clothes from his body, wa&s;h it with care, and commit it to the earth with his own hands?</P>
<P>Such actions, among us, would be con&s;idered as heroic. Among the Arabs, they are only the con|&s;equences of their &s;y&s;tem. To undeceive them, on this head, would be de&s;troying their tranquillity, amid&s;t the de&s;poti&s;m and continual alarms which op|pre&s;s them. This &s;y&s;tem, in our religion, would open a door to every crime, by depriving us of moral li|berty; but, among the Mahometans, it produces re|&s;ignation to the will of the Supreme Being; and, is attended with no other inconvenience, than that of making them neglect tho&s;e precautions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to guard them from phy&s;ical evils. Dan|gerous in the religion of a Chri&s;tian; it becomes a ma&s;ter-piece of policy and philo&s;ophy: in that of a Mahometan, it differs little from that re&s;ignation to Providence, enjoined by Chri&s;tianity, but ill under|&s;tood, and carried too far among Mahometans.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o from the principles of their religion, that the Arabs have a kind of veneration for idiots, whom they con&s;ider as &s;aints, and privileged beings, favoured by heaven. I &s;aw one, &s;ays <HI>Poiret,</HI> who was perfectly naked; he entered, with freedom, into
<PB N="167" REF="179">
all the tents, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the women, without giving the lea&s;t offence to their hu&s;bands. To &s;top him, or to treat him with rudene&s;s, would have been an action worthy of puni&s;hment. He could go and eat where he cho&s;e, and no one refu&s;ed to give him what he wi&s;hed for. Even the &s;cheik him&s;elf endured his importunities and familiarity, with a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing complai&s;ance.</P>

<P>THE Arabs are unacquainted with any other phy|&s;ician than nature; or with any other remedies than tho&s;e pre&s;ented by ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. This nation, which formerly gave birth to &s;o many celebrated and able men, for curing the ills of huma|nity, who were the fathers of medicine, is, at pre&s;ent, even ignorant of its former &s;plendor; and has re|&s;igned, to other kingdoms, the lamp it fir&s;t lighted. It is rather, however, from ignorance, than contempt,
<PB N="168" REF="180">
that the Arabs, in their maladies, have no recour&s;e to medicine. The European phy&s;icians, who happen to be among&s;t them, are very well received; and, this character is the only thing that can make them re&s;pect the life of a &s;tranger. What is very &s;ingular, is, that the&s;e men, who are often not &s;en&s;ible of their being indi&s;po&s;ed, when they really are &s;o, become &s;ick, at lea&s;t in imagination, when they &s;ee a phy&s;ician; eager to receive his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and fearing to let &s;lip the op|portunity, they examine their health &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly, that there are few of them who do not think them|&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking phy&s;ic, were it only by the way of a preventative. Not daring to de|cide them&s;elves, whether they are well or not, they pre&s;ent their arms to the phy&s;ician, that he may feel their pul&s;e; and they can &s;carce believe his deci&s;ion, when he a&s;&s;ures them, they are in good health. They have &s;o much confidence in letting blood, that the healthie&s;t think they have occa&s;ion for this operation, which they con&s;ider as an univer&s;al remedy. For want of a &s;urgeon, they often bleed them&s;elves, by a proce&s;s, which would be very terrible to tho&s;e deli|cate people, who faint at the &s;ight of a lancet.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, who is to perform the operation, begins binding a bandage round the neck of his patient, &s;o clo&s;ely, that he is almo&s;t &s;trangled. When the veins of the forehead appear &s;welled, by the blood checked
<PB N="169" REF="181">
in its circulation, the operator makes four or five in|ci&s;ions, with a razor; and, in a moment, the patient's face is covered with blood, the effu&s;ion of which is a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by rolling a cylindric bit of wood over the in|ci&s;ions. Sometimes the Arabs bleed them&s;elves in the feet, but always by pur&s;uing the &s;ame method. When the operation is fini&s;hed, they wa&s;h the wounds, apply to them a little clayey earth, &s;oftened in water, and bind them up with a handkerchief. This opera|tion does not prevent them from immediately follow|ing their u&s;ual occupations. To this is all the medi|cine of the Arabs confined, except a few particular remedies, pre&s;erved by tradition, and admini&s;tered with a certain mixture of &s;uper&s;tition. They have al&s;o much faith in amulets and tali&s;mans.</P>
<P>The Arabs, it is true, are not acquainted with that multitude of di&s;orders, the con&s;equence of luxury and intemperance. Tho&s;e, to which they are mo&s;t &s;ubject, ari&s;e from their exce&s;&s;ive filthine&s;s, from the mar&s;hy places they inhabit, from their exce&s;&s;es with women, or from the badne&s;s of their food. The&s;e are cuta|neous di&s;orders, intermittent or putrid fevers, rheu|mati&s;m, and wa&s;ting of the humours and blood.</P>
<P>In continual wars with one another, the Arabs are much expo&s;ed to gun-&s;hot wounds, and fractures;
<PB N="170" REF="182">
but they leave them entirely to nature. Some cure, and others pre&s;erve natural ulcers, which they retain during life. But, if the Arabs do not derive the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance from medicine as we do, they do not feel its inconveniences: their imaginations are not frightened by the deci&s;ions of a phy&s;ician; and the va|rious medicines, with which the apartments of our &s;ick are furni&s;hed, neither offend their fight, nor damp their courage. As it is not nece&s;&s;ary, on account of religion, or of their civil affairs, that they &s;hould be forewarned of their la&s;t hour; they expire without thinking on death. As long as they can move, they walk; if they cannot, they remain in one &s;pot, &s;tretch|ed out on the earth, without ever pulling off their clothes. If the &s;ick per&s;on fore&s;ees his la&s;t moment, he turns his face towards the Ea&s;t, and dies calmly, recommending him&s;elf to <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Arabs, who &s;et little value on the lives of mankind, re&s;pect their remains, and take the utmo&s;t care of their interment: the want of it, they con&s;ider as one of the greate&s;t misfortunes that can happen; and, in the pre&s;ent de&s;olation, they die with compo|&s;ure, when they are certain to leave &s;ome one behind, who will bury them. The &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment, there|fore, among them, is to be cut in pieces, and thrown to the dogs. Their funeral ceremonies, &s;ays <HI>Poiret,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="183">
as far as I have had an opportunity of ob&s;erving them, are as follow:</P>
<P>Scarce has an Arab breathed his la&s;t, when his body is carefully wa&s;hed; after which it is wrapped in a winding-&s;heet, of white cloth, re&s;erved for that purpo&s;e. This cloth is manufactured in the towns of Arabia; but they &s;et the highe&s;t value upon that brought from Mecca, and which has been ble&s;&s;ed by the principal Iman. The benediction is expen&s;ive; but the &s;ingular favours annexed to it, make them forget what it co&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the dead body is purified, it is placed upon a kind of litter, and carried to the place of in|terment, either on hor&s;eback, or by the friends and relations of the decea&s;ed. While the men are em|ployed in digging the grave, the women &s;quat down in a circle round the body, which they feel and un|cover; and, afterwards, conver&s;e together with much indifference; but every now and then they break off their di&s;cour&s;e, to give vent to their lamentations, to a&s;k the body que&s;tions, and to be&s;eech it, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to return again, and take up its abode among them. "Why," &s;ay they, "ha&s;t thou quitted us? Did we not prepare thy <HI>courcou&s;an</HI> well? Alas! &s;hall thy children then behold thee no more? Ah! return again; nothing &s;hall be wanting to thee. But
<PB N="172" REF="184">
thou heare&s;t no more; thou no longer give&s;t an an|&s;wer to our words; thou heare&s;t only our &s;ighs, &amp;c." The&s;e di&s;mal lamentations, which di&s;play a natural and pathetic eloquence, would have a powerful effect in moving the heart of a &s;pectator; did he not &s;ee the&s;e very women, a moment after, throw a&s;ide that external appearance of the deepe&s;t grief, talk and laugh together, and afterwards return to their former lamentations.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tender complaints, they tear their hair, and open the veins of their temples, with their nails; while the blood trickles down, mingled with their tears, and exhibits an appearance of the deepe&s;t de&s;pair. When the grave is fini&s;hed, the body is de|po&s;ited in it, on its &s;ide, and with the face turned to|wards the Ea&s;t. One of their <HI>papas</HI> puts into its hands a letter of recommendation to <HI>Mahomet;</HI> after which a kind of arch is formed over it, with the bran|ches of trees, in order that the earth may not touch it. When the grave is covered with earth, other branches of trees are laid over it, and a quantity of large &s;tones, to prevent &s;avage animals from devour|ing the body, in the night time. In the middle of the &s;tones an opening is left, where they depo&s;it earthen ve&s;&s;els, and other family uten&s;ils; but this is only done to Arabs of rank. Before they quit the grave, they erect in the middle of it, a kind of funeral flag; which

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF ITALY, FROM BUSCHIN, MARTYN, MILLER, PIOZZI, BARETTI, KEYSLER, ADDISON, SHARP, SHERLOCK, GROSLEY, NORTHALL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE general name of Italy was probably derived from Aetolia, a Grecian nation, oppo&s;ite to this country, from which it is &s;eparated only by the Adri|atic gulph. The &s;outhern part was inhabited by va|rious tribes, who communicated their names to the &s;everal &s;ubdivi&s;ions; as the Latins, Sabines, Tu&s;cans, Samnites, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>According to the earlie&s;t accounts in hi&s;tory, this beautiful penin&s;ula was in the &s;ame &s;ituation as it is
<PB N="176" REF="189">
now, cantoned out into various little &s;tates, and re|publics, all living in di&s;tru&s;t, and at variance with each other.</P>
<P>We have different computations of the extent of Italy, according to the different notions, that ancient and modern writers have entertained of the proper boundaries of this country: let it &s;uffice, however, that from the frontiers of Switzerland, to the extre|mity of the kingdom of Naples, it is about &s;even hun|dred and fifty miles in length; and, from the fron|tiers of the duchy of Savoy, to tho&s;e of the dominions of the &s;tate of Venice, which is its greate&s;t breadth, about four hundred miles; though, in &s;ome parts, it is &s;carce a fourth part as broad.</P>
<P>It is bounded by the Alps, which &s;eparates it from France, Switzerland, and Germany, towards the North and North-we&s;t; by the gulph of Venice, or Adriatic &s;ea, and the country of Trent, towards the Ea&s;t; by the Ionian &s;ea, and &s;trait of Me&s;&s;ina, towards the South; and the Tu&s;can &s;ea towards the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The principal mountains in Italy are, the Alps and Apennines. The Alps, which word, in its general ac|ceptation, &s;ignifies high mountains, are a long chain of hills, beginning at the mouth of the river Var; and, after many irregular windings, terminating near the
<PB N="177" REF="190">
river Ar&s;ia, in I&s;tria, in the Adriatic. They divide Italy from France, Switzerland and Germany, and are variou&s;ly denominated according to their &s;ituation. The Appennine mountains take their ri&s;e near the Alps, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, in the territories of Genoa, and dividing Italy into almo&s;t two equal parts, reach to the &s;traits that &s;eparate it from Sicily.</P>
<P>The large&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable rivers in Italy, are, 1. The Po, in Latin, Padus, or Eridanus, which ri&s;es in one of the highe&s;t mountains in the Alps. After receiving upwards of thirty &s;mall rivers, it empties it&s;elf into the Adriatic, by &s;even different mouths.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Adige, in Latin Athe&s;is, has its &s;ource likewi&s;e in the Alps, and waters the cities of Trent and Verona. It is the only large river in Lom|bardy; and, in&s;tead of joining the Po, runs, as this river does, into the Adriatic.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Arno flows from the Appennine mountains, and falls into the Tu&s;can &s;ea, near Pi&s;a.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Tiber, in Latin Tiberis, ri&s;es al&s;o out of the Apennine mountains; and, at a little di&s;tance from Rome, empties it&s;elf into the Tu&s;can &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="191">Italy lies between the thirtieth, or, if we include Sicily, the thirty-&s;eventh and forty-&s;ixth degree of North latitude; therefore, the air of this country mu&s;t be very different according to the different &s;itu|ations of the &s;everal countries of which it is compo&s;ed. The Northern parts, that lie upon the Alps, are cold, and covered with &s;now in winter; the hills of the Apennine, which run almo&s;t the whole length of Italy, are al&s;o cold; but, the countries on the North of the Apennine, are temperate; and tho&s;e on the South are warm. The Campania of Rome is unhealthy; and &s;o is the Ferrare&s;e, occa&s;ioned by bogs and &s;tag|nant waters. In other parts, the air is generally pure and dry; and, though Naples, from its Southern &s;itu|ation, might be thought the hotte&s;t; yet, being almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, it is continually refre&s;hed by breezes from thence.</P>
<P>This country, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> produces every thing in great plenty, for the u&s;es and conveniences of life. All materials for enjoyment, and a variety of deli|cacies, which lie &s;cattered, as it were, in other coun|tries, are here almo&s;t every where met with in pro|fu&s;ion. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of corn, rich wines, and the choice&s;t fruits; &s;uch as oranges, citrons, lemons, olives, pomegranates, &amp;c. oil, &s;ugar, almonds, rai&s;ins; mulberry-trees beyond number, to facilitate the pro|duction of &s;ilk; tame and wild bea&s;ts, alaba&s;ter, ja&s;|per,
<PB N="179" REF="192">
iron, alum, &s;ulphur, gold, &s;ilver, &amp;c. On this account Italy is ju&s;tly &s;tiled, by writers, the parent of plenty: the &s;ource of earthly felicity; the pride of our globe; the garden of Europe; the beauty of the world, and even a microco&s;m within it&s;elf. But the fine plants, which, from time to time, have been brought into the We&s;tern countries from Italy, as the reputed mother of them, are not all originally natives, the far greater part being tran&s;planted to the Italian &s;oil, from the Ea&s;t. All the fruit-trees, the produce of which the Latins call <HI>mala,</HI> were tran&s;ported to Italy, after the conque&s;t of the Romans in Africa, Greece, A&s;ia-Minor, and Syria. The apricots came from Epirus, and are called <HI>mala Epirotica;</HI> the peaches, <HI>mala Per&s;ica,</HI> from Per&s;ia; the citrons, <HI>mala Medica,</HI> from Media; the pomegranates, <HI>mala Punica,</HI> from Carthage; and che&s;nuts from <HI>Ca&s;tania,</HI> in the di&s;trict of Magne&s;ia, in Macedonia. The be&s;t pears, as their names &s;ufficiently indicate, were &s;ent from Alexandria, Numidia, Greece, and Numantia. The fir&s;t plumbs were imported from Armenia and Syria, and e&s;pecially from Dama&s;cus. <HI>Lucius Lucullus,</HI> was the fir&s;t who introduced cherry-trees from Pontus, which &s;oon after became the growth of all other coun|tries throughout Europe.</P>
<P>However rich and exuberant Italy may be deemed in general, yet no &s;mall difference is di&s;cernible, in
<PB N="180" REF="193">
re&s;pect to the futility, whole&s;omene&s;s, and plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of its provinces. It is &s;ubject to &s;everal, and great inconveniences, e&s;pecially in the middle and lower parts, as will more particularly appear in the de&s;cription of the re&s;pective territories. In &s;ome countries, the number of inhabitants is far from &s;uf|ficient for the culture, and improvement of the &s;oil. On con&s;idering the multitude of people in Italy, during the time of the Roman emperors, its pre&s;ent de&s;olatene&s;s, which is mo&s;t perceptible in the domi|nions of the Pope, cannot but appear &s;urprizing. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> a judicious ob&s;erver of men and things, is of opinion, that the <HI>Campania</HI> of ancient Rome, con|tained more people, than there are at pre&s;ent in all Italy; and, that there is not a town of any con&s;e|quence, in the whole country, where the eccle&s;ia&s;tics make, if not half, at lea&s;t one-third of the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Italy may be con&s;idered under three grand divi|&s;ions: 1. Upper Italy, comprehending Lombardy, &s;o as to include the principality of Piedmont; to which may be added, the dukedom of Savoy, though on this &s;ide the Alps; the duchies of Mont&s;errat, Milan, Parma, Modena, and Mantua, with the republics of Genoa and Venice. 2. Middle Italy, containing the dominions of the pope, and the grand duke of Tu&s;|cany; with the republics of Lucca and St. Marino.

3. The lower, or Southern part of Italy, con&s;i&s;ting of the kingdom of Naples. We will begin with the lower divi&s;ion, the kingdom of Naples, as being mo&s;t proximate to the countries we have been &s;peak|ing of, thence proceed to the &s;econd divi&s;ion, and end with the fir&s;t, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE provinces, of which the kingdom of Naples con&s;i&s;ts, were formerly a part of the dominions of the Roman Republic, and afterwards of the Em|perors. It is now, by the vici&s;&s;itudes of time, govern|ed with the i&s;land of Sicily, by a &s;on of the late king of Spain. From being once a Roman colony, it partook, as did Rome it&s;elf, of a number of very &s;tately and magnificent edifices; which, by the hand of time, by earthquakes and wars, are now a &s;cene of ruins; but

there is a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, to the antiquary and man of learning, to travel over this cla&s;&s;ic ground; and view, in the many ruins he meets with, the ancient &s;plendor and magnificence of their Roman ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The population of the kingdom of Naples, accord|ing to <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> in 1782, was 4,675,000; that of Sicily, 1,300,000; and that of the E&s;tates belonging to the King, 30 000; in the whole 6,005,000. Naples contains 1,274 &s;quare miles; Sicily, 576; the E&s;tates of the King, 14; in the whole 1,864.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Naples, independent of the i&s;land of Sicily, which is part of the empire; and thus gives the title of King of the two Sicilies; I &s;ay the king|dom of Naples it&s;elf, called Lower Italy, is bounded on the North-ea&s;t by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, known by the name of the Pope's territories; and, on all the other parts, by the Mediterranean and Adriatic &s;eas. Its extent, from South-ea&s;t to North-we&s;t, is two hun|hred and eighty Engli&s;h miles: from North ea&s;t to South-we&s;t, from ninety &s;ix to one hundred and twenty miles. It is u&s;ually divided into four large provinces, Terra di Lavora, Abruzzo, Apulia, and Calabria; containing the old Samnium, Campania, Apulia, Lu|cania, and Brutium, with a little of Latium.</P>
<P>The old Appian road, made by the Romans, from Rome to Capua, and afterwards to the &s;eaport
<PB N="184" REF="198">
Brundu&s;ium, runs almo&s;t through the whole extent of the kingdom of Naples, and is a wonderful work of man; which, in &s;ome parts of it, has both on the right and left, one continued row of ruined palaces, temples, aqueducts, and tombs. What a glorious &s;ight mu&s;t Italy have afforded to Northern Virtuo&s;i, who came to &s;ee it in the time of the Upper Empire. This road is a cau&s;eway, made of the lava of Ve&s;u|vius, that liquid fiery &s;ub&s;tance, which the volcano has thrown out, from time to time, and which, on cooling, becomes as hard as rock, and as &s;mooth as marble. This cau&s;eway, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> appeared evidently to me, to re&s;t all along on &s;olid ma&s;onry work, lined with &s;mall &s;tones, of equal &s;ize with tho&s;e of the upper &s;ide, which are about eighteen inches &s;quare, and bound together with cement, &s;o as to form one &s;olid block. In comparing roads of &s;uch a con&s;truction, with mo|dern roads, the latter &s;eem only as gravel walks; which, in cour&s;e of time, without repair, would be|come mires, impa&s;&s;able by carriages: whereas, this pavement has continued, in many places, in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, more than two thou&s;and years; being begun three hundred and thirty-two years before Chri&s;t, by <HI>Appius Claudius,</HI> the cen&s;or. It is three hundred and &s;ixty miles in length.</P>
<P>Fundi, is the frontier town of the kingdom of Naples, between this and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. It
<PB N="185" REF="199">
&s;tands upon a plain, &s;heltered by hills, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e with Italian towns; but it has nothing very attractive to the traveller.</P>
<P>This country is extremely hot; and &s;ubjects foreign|ers, unle&s;s they take great care of them&s;elves, to a &s;ickly habit of body; particularly if they travel in July, Augu&s;t, or September. In the lower part of the kingdom, little winter is felt.</P>
<P>The &s;ummers, even at Naples, are &s;o exceeding clo&s;e and hot, that were it to happen only once in thirty or forty years, they would call it a plague. They &s;it in chairs, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> with only a thin callico gown, &s;ome days, for hours together; wholly occupied in wiping off the &s;weat, that runs in channels down their bodies. The winters here are exceedingly plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome; for, notwith&s;tanding the rain, you &s;ee no damps on the &s;tair-ca&s;es, nor on the walls of your chambers; their iron does not ru&s;t, as with us; nay, the paintings on the out&s;ide of their buildings, in fre&s;co, remain for years. It is &s;o warm, that the flies do not leave them all the year. The quantity of rain at Naples, is much more con&s;iderable, than that which falls on the &s;ame &s;pace of-ground in England. When the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;ets in, it commonly la&s;ts &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive weeks, falling, not in &s;uch &s;howers as we are accu&s;tomed to; having rain more

or le&s;s, every month in the year, but, by pailfuls; an ab&s;olute water-&s;pout, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> that carries all before it, and almo&s;t drowns the unfortunate pa&s;&s;en|ger, who is caught out of doors by the &s;torm; and yet, Naples is &s;o well paved, that immediately after the rain, the &s;treets are clean and dry. Whole months of drought, are compen&s;ated by the deluge of a day; and, be&s;ides, the South winds are &s;o boi&s;terous, in winter, as to bur&s;t open the bolts of both doors and windows. In &s;ummer time, the air is con&s;tantly re|fre&s;hed by the &s;ea-breeze. Farenheit's thermometer &s;eldom ri&s;es higher than 76; whereas, at Rome, it ri&s;es to 89. At the end of January, the thermometer is &s;eldom lower than 36. At Rome, it falls to 27; &s;o that the difference, between the greate&s;t degree of heat and cold, at Naples, is only 40 degrees; whereas at Rome, though more to the Northward, it is 62. But the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the Neapolitan cli|mate is the Sirocc, or South-ea&s;t wind; which, in May and June, is very common. It is infinitely more relaxing, and gives the vapours in a much higher degree, than the wor&s;t of our rainy Novembers. It will blow for &s;even or eight days, or more, without in|termi&s;&s;ion; it blows as hot, as from the mouth of an oven, and gives &s;uch a degree of la&s;&s;itude, both to mind and body, that renders men ab&s;olutely incapa|ble of performing their u&s;ual functions. It is not, perhaps, &s;urpri&s;ing, that it &s;hould produce the&s;e effects

A &s;mart Pari&s;ian marquis came here, about ten days ago, in the month of May, and was &s;o full of animal &s;pirits, that the people thought him mad. He never remained a moment in the &s;ame place; but, at their grave conver&s;ations, u&s;ed to &s;kip from room to room, with &s;uch amazing ela&s;ticity, that the Italians &s;wore he had got &s;prings in his &s;hoes. I met him, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> this morning, walking with the &s;tep of a philo&s;opher; a &s;melling-bottle in his hand, and all his vivacity extingui&s;hed. I a&s;ked him what made him &s;o dull? <HI>Ah! mon ami,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>je n'ennui &agrave; la mort;&mdash;moi, qui n'ai jamais &s;&ccedil;u l'ennui.

<P>The natives them&s;elves do not &s;uffer le&s;s than &s;tran|gers; and all nature &s;eems to langui&s;h during this abominable wind. A Neapolitan lover avoids his mi&s;tre&s;s, with the utmo&s;t care, in the time of the &s;irocc; and the indolence it in&s;pires, is almo&s;t &s;uf|ficient to extingui&s;h every pa&s;&s;ion. All works of genius are laid a&s;ide, during its continuance; and, when any thing very flat or in&s;ipid is produced, the &s;tronge&s;t phra&s;e of di&s;approbation they can be&s;tow is,

<P>It is not the warmth of this wind, that renders it &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;pirits; it is rather the want of that genial quality which is &s;o enlivening, and which ever renders the We&s;tern breeze &s;o agreeable. The &s;pring, and ela&s;ticity of the air, &s;eems to be lo&s;t; and that active principle, which animates all nature, appears to be dead. The thermometer, which before the wind &s;tood at 43, ro&s;e, whil&s;t it blew, to 71. Sea-bathing is the be&s;t antidote again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>Martyn</HI> &s;ays, though con&s;umptive people re&s;ort to Naples, for a recovery of health, yet this is a frequent di&s;ea&s;e here. The climate &s;eems unfavourable to it; owing, probably, to the &s;tillne&s;s of the bay; the height of the hills behind the city, and the &s;udden tran&s;itions from heat to cold. The rains generally continue from the end of December, to the middle of January, which is followed by an agreeable &s;pring, nearly re|&s;embling the &s;ummer of our Northern climates; ex|cept, that the &s;eas are continually &s;tormy and dan|gerous. Almond trees bloom in February, and gar|den vegetables are in &s;ea&s;on all the year round. Ice is &s;eldom &s;een in the level country; &s;ometimes years pa&s;s without &s;now falling, and, when it does fall, it

di&s;&s;olves as &s;oon as it reaches the ground. What is collected, is from the mountains.</P>
<P>In the plains, ice or &s;now is very rarely &s;een. The &s;now, that &s;ometimes falls in the mountainous parts, is gathered and kept, for cooling liquors in &s;ummer-time, in&s;tead of ice. Even &s;o early as April, the &s;un darts a very great heat, but the nights are cold. The fertility of the &s;oil is very extraordinary; being pro|ductive to an exuberance of all kinds of grain; and the fine&s;t fruits and culinary plants may be cultivated and rai&s;ed, at any time of the year. Oil, wines, rice, flax, are equal to the fine&s;t of other countries. Ca|labria affords great quantities of manna; and both there, and in other parts of the kingdom, &s;affron grows, and is deemed as good as that brought from the Ea&s;t. The hills of Pau&s;olippo are covered with flouri&s;hing almond-trees, palm-trees, and the great American agave. Fig-trees are very common all over the king|dom; and the evergreen lemon and orange, give the hills a mo&s;t agreeable variety of colours, and the ap|pearance of a botanical garden; for lemons, citrons, cedrates, pomegranates, and china apples, grow be|tween Rome and Naples, without any particular cul|ture. There are whole fore&s;ts of &s;uch trees, near Terracina, the frontier between the two &s;tates; but they are, in flavour and fragrance, much below the the Spani&s;h and Portugal fruits. There are ripe

<P>Whil&s;t I was in England, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> I never heard the words Northern Climate pronounced, but they con|veyed to me an idea of barrenne&s;s and imperfection; I had always conceived that vegetables, and garden-fruits, attained a flavour and &s;avourine&s;s, in the more Southern climes, unknown to the latitude of 51; but, to my great &s;urprize, I do not find, that any of their herbage is equal in ta&s;te and &s;weetne&s;s, to that which grows in our gardens; and as to Italy being the gar|den of the world, beautiful and fertile as &s;ome parts of it are, the amazing quantity of barren mountains, extending from almo&s;t the one extremity to the other, &s;hould &s;eem to deprive it of that character; and, how|ever bold and uncommon the a&s;&s;ertion may appear, I think England a better re&s;emblance of a garden than Italy, and &s;hould not he&s;itate to oppo&s;e our verdure and inclo&s;ures, to their myrtle and orange-trees; which la&s;t are not to be &s;een in winter, out of green-hou&s;es, except in the Southern parts of Italy.</P>
<P>Their green pea (of which they have but one &s;ort) is infinitely le&s;s delicious than ours; and what is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, few of their fruits excel ours; I be|lieve none, except their water-melons, their figs, and their grapes. An Engli&s;h gentleman at Naples, who

imported his ra&s;berry jam from England, made iced ra&s;berry of a much higher flavour, than any made at Naples immediately from the fruit it&s;elf. A noble Venetian procured a &s;kilful gardener from England, in hopes of improving the culture of his garden. I conver&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> with this gardener, whom I found under a &s;tate of di&s;couragement and de&s;pair. he told me, he had not yet ever ta&s;ted a peach in Italy, of a true flavour, and he believed he never &s;hould; for that he was thwarted and ob&s;tructed by the other gardeners, in his attempts to reform their practice; that he had no authority over them, but was confined to his own proper department, which he told me would an&s;wer very little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o allum, vitriol, &s;ulphur, rock chry&s;tal, quarries of fine marble, and a variety of minerals. Gla&s;s works make a beneficial branch of trade, as do the Neapolitan hor&s;es, which are much e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>The cream-coloured hor&s;es, &s;uch as draw our king's &s;tate coach, are a common breed here, and &s;hine like &s;atin; here are &s;ome too of a &s;hining &s;ilver white, wonderfully elegant; the ladies exhibit a variety in the colour of their cattle which draw them.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> tells us, that they &s;hewed her at Naples, a &s;kew-ball, or pye-balled a&s;s, well proportioned,
<PB N="192" REF="206">
coated like a racer in an Engli&s;h &s;tud, &s;ixteen hands and a half high; his colour bay and white, in large patches, and his temper &s;ingularly mild and gentle; &s;he could have purcha&s;ed it for two pounds fifteen &s;hillings Engli&s;h. Hares and partridges are &s;o tame in this country, that they will run under the carriage-wheels.</P>
<P>Buffaloes are here common; a peculiar chee&s;e is made of their milk, rolled up like &s;tiff pieces of rib|band. Of their black &s;hining horns, they make &s;nuff-boxes and combs; and a buff-leather of their &s;kins. As this creature is unruly, they lead them with bra&s;s or iron rings, drawn through their no&s;es. The wool of their &s;heep is fine and good, and they make a great deal of &s;ilk. Of the filaments, or a kind of hair or wool, growing on &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h, are made wai&s;tcoats, caps, &s;tockings, and gloves, much warmer than wool; and though not &s;o fine, and &s;oft as &s;ilk, yet always re|taining a peculiar glo&s;s.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome di&s;agreeable animals in this coun|try, though harmle&s;s; one is the green-lizard, of which there are great &s;warms, common, indeed, to mo&s;t other parts of Italy. In &s;pring, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> hundreds of the&s;e little animals are &s;een ba&s;king on the flat roofs; and as they crawl up and down the walls, if a window or door be left open, they make their
<PB N="193" REF="207">
way into the hou&s;es. The &s;corpion is a much greater nu&s;ance, which harbours not only in old buildings, and under large &s;tones, but infe&s;ts the hou&s;es in this country; &s;o that, in &s;ome places, it is not unu&s;ual to make the bead&s;teads of poli&s;hed iron, and to place them at &s;ome di&s;tance from the wall, to prevent the&s;e vermin from getting into the beds. It is true they &s;eldom hurt, unle&s;s attacked, or accidentally injured, which may ea&s;ily happen by a per&s;on's turning in his bed.</P>
<P>Another plague, almo&s;t peculiar to the kingdom of Naples, e&s;pecially the Southern parts, is the tarantula, &s;o called from the city of Tarento, in which neigh|bourhood it mo&s;t abounds. It is a large &s;pider, with eight eyes; the bite, or &s;ting of which, is cured only by mu&s;ic. The patient, under the venom of this in|&s;ect, has extravagant vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;hrieking, &s;obbing, laughing, dancing, &amp;c. They cannot bear the &s;ight of black, or blue, but &s;eem delighted with red or green objects; they have an abhorrence al&s;o, to eating fruit and vegetables. A melancholy &s;ilence, and a fixed eye, are the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order; at this time mu&s;ic is called in to rou&s;e the patient to a violent motion, and thus promoting a copious &s;weat. Diffe|rent patients are not affected but by different tunes. They mu&s;t be lively, and chiefly with the guitar, haut|boy, trumpet, violin, and Sicilian kettle-drum. The
<PB N="194" REF="208">
country people, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> who are more or le&s;s &s;killed in all the&s;e in&s;truments, enforce the operation of their mu&s;ic with grimaces, and odd ge&s;ticulations. Several tunes are played, before the right one, per|haps, is found; I mean the one that &s;ets the patient a dancing; which exerci&s;e is involuntary, and heighten|ed, by playing quicker on the in&s;truments. When nature &s;eems to be exhau&s;ted, the mu&s;ic is &s;u&s;pended, and the patient put to bed and &s;weated. His &s;pirits thus recovered, he is called out of bed again by the &s;ame tune, and dances till he faints with fatigue, and falls, then he is removed to his bed; and thus, in a few days, the cure is compleated. Sometimes it has been known to return the next year; but the &s;ame pre&s;cription is always applied. If no means of cure are applied, the patient is carried off in a few days. The petticoats of women are apt to harbour the&s;e vermin; and, of cour&s;e, they are more liable to be bitten than men. <HI>Swinburne</HI> is of opinion, that if per&s;ons, bit by this in&s;ect, are ever involuntarily affected, it is an attack upon their nerves only, a &s;pecies of St. Vitus's dance; but he doubts the truth of the di&s;order, and &s;o do many others, it having never been known to affect any but the very poor: of this, we &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P>Among the natural curio&s;ities of this country, the Phrygian &s;tone, or the <HI>pietra fringifera,</HI> may be
<PB N="195" REF="209">
cla&s;&s;ed. It has neither the hardne&s;s of &s;tone, nor the properties of earth, but con&s;i&s;ts of an indurated mix|ture of earth, rotten beech-wood, and fibres of dif|ferent plants; from which, being laid in a moi&s;t and &s;hady place, grow in a few days, according to its &s;ize, mu&s;hrooms, weighing often twenty pounds each. The &s;eed lies in the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tone, and is di&s;tin|gui&s;hable only from du&s;t, by a good micro&s;cope. The growth of the mu&s;hrooms is greatly forwarded, by pouring warm water on the &s;tone. There are other &s;ingularities, which we &s;hall &s;peak of in the places where they are found.</P>
<P>The Appenine mountains extend throughout the whole length of the country, and terminate at the &s;treights of Sicily. Mount Ve&s;uvius, &s;o well known for its fiery eruptions, lies five Italian miles from the city of Naples, but di&s;tinct from the Appenines. Its declivity, every where towards the &s;ea, is planted with vines and fruit-trees, and is no le&s;s fertile towards the bottom. The circumjacent plain affords a charm|ing pro&s;pect, and the air is clear and whole&s;ome. The wine here produced, is very delicious, and of three &s;orts; two are a yellow mu&s;cadine; and the third, abu&s;ively called <HI>lachrymoe Chri&s;ti,</HI> &s;o called from the drops of juice oozing from the grapes when fully ripe; of the latter, the little that is made is re&s;erved for the king's cellar, who makes pre&s;ents of it. The South,
<PB N="196" REF="210">
and We&s;t &s;ides of the mountain, exhibit a very dif|ferent view; being, like the top, covered with black cinders, fleck, and &s;tones. On this di&s;mal &s;ide, the mountain is cleft a&s;under. Its North peak re&s;embles an inverted cone, &s;triking the eye with an accumula|ted ma&s;s of &s;tones, &s;and, and cinders; and is properly the vulcano. It has another peak, called the Somma. The North peak is three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred feet above the level of the &s;ea; but the other peak only three thou&s;and three hundred and thirty. The black a&s;hes, with which the upper part of the mountain is covered, render the a&s;cent very tedious and toil&s;ome; though curious per&s;ons are a&s;&s;i&s;ted in climbing, by the pea&s;ants fa&s;tening belts round their wai&s;ts, of which the climbers take hold, and are thus helped up. The higher we a&s;cend, the hotter is the ground, and often rumbling noi&s;es are heard from within; and, in many places, are clefts through which the &s;moke con&s;tantly i&s;&s;ues. Its mouth alters its form at every irruption, and often the depth within is &s;o con&s;iderable, that cu|rious per&s;ons have ventured down into it. Prior to an irruption, the mountain &s;eems to give a warning of its rage, by a dreadful noi&s;e, &s;haking all the adjacent places, and afterwards belching forth a&s;hes and &s;tones, of three or four hundred pounds weight, and ca&s;ting them to the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles. Several times, as in the years 1694, 1737, 1751, 1754, and 1755, and much later than this, a flaming &s;tream of melted
<PB N="197" REF="211">
&s;ulphur, metals and minerals, has i&s;&s;ued out of its crater, or mouth, as from a cauldron boiling over; &s;weeping along with it large &s;tones, and ravaging the whole country, through which it &s;hapes its cour&s;e. When this fluid matter becomes cold, it has all the hardne&s;s of &s;tone; and, in &s;ome places, &s;tands in huge heaps &s;ixty ells high, which have been broken to pieces to pave the &s;treets. Naples is paved with this lava. The inhabitants, in the neighbourhood, are plea&s;ed with a moderate eructation every year; experience having taught them, that then few, or no &s;hocks of earthquakes, need be apprehended, and the&s;e but &s;light. There is &s;uch a quantity of combu&s;tible mat|ter in the bowels of the earth, in this part of the world, that was it not for the&s;e tunnels, or chimnies, acting as vent for the fire, earthquakes would be very frequent; and it is remarked, that Ve&s;uvius, and Etna in Sicily, generally vent their fury at the &s;ame time. Indeed, as it is, earthquakes are very frequent. The city of Herculaneum was overwhelmed with a torrent of fire, in the year 79, and all its buildings buried within the earth, &s;eventy feet deep. Pompeia, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and &s;o lately as the year 1783, the whole province of Calabria was laid wa&s;te, and the city of Me&s;&s;ina, in Sicily, overthrown, and up|wards of forty thou&s;and per&s;ons de&s;troyed. The earth &s;hook &s;o violently, for many days, that the in|habitants near the &s;ea coa&s;t, on the &s;treights of Sicily,
<PB N="198" REF="212">
ran out and lay upon the beach, to avoid being cru&s;hed by the falling hou&s;es; but, unfortunately for them, a promontory, with a whole town upon it, broke from the land, and fell into the &s;ea, driving the waters before it; which, on their return, over|whelmed the beach; and, on their falling backwards into the &s;ea again, &s;wept off with it all that were on the &s;hore, to the number of forty thou&s;and. So dreadful is this calamity!</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> arrived at Naples, at two o'clock in the morning, in very &s;tormy weather, at a time when Ve|&s;uvius was vomiting forth torrents of flaming lava down its &s;ides, and was the only object vi&s;ible. At this time thunder, lightning, rain, and wind, were contending for the ma&s;tery; and combining to extin|gui&s;h the torches, brought to light her from her car|riage. She a&s;ked a Franci&s;can friar, if it was the fa|mous vulcano? Yes, replied he, that's our mountain which throws up money for us, by calling foreigners to &s;ee the extraordinary effects of &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a phe|nomenon! Such a calmne&s;s, in &s;uch a &s;torm, was more, &s;ays &s;he, than my &s;en&s;es could credit. The blue lightning, who&s;e colour &s;hewed the nature of the original minerals, from which &s;he drew her exi&s;tence, &s;hone around us, from time to time, in a broad expan&s;e, and &s;udden darkne&s;s followed in an in&s;tant. No object then, but the fiery river could be &s;een, till another fla&s;h
<PB N="199" REF="213">
&s;hewed us the waves of the &s;ea, to&s;&s;ing and breaking, at a height inconceivable.</P>
<P>Nothing, &s;ure, was ever more awful or &s;ublime, than our entrance into Naples, at that dead hour of night; not a whi&s;per to be heard in the &s;treets, and not a glimp&s;e of light to lead us on our way, but repeated fla&s;hes of livid lightning, and the glare of the burn|ing mountain. My poor maid, adds this lady, had, by this time, nearly lo&s;t her wits by terror; and my French valet, exau&s;ted with fatigue, beat down with the thunder claps, and covered with rain and &s;ea-&s;pray, had ju&s;t life enough to exclaim, <HI>"Ah madame! Il me &s;emble que nous &s;ommes venus icy expr&egrave;s pour voir le fin du monde!"</HI></P>
<P>And yet, there are people who live at the foot of this mountain, without any fear. It is &s;o prolific as to compen&s;ate for all this dread; a&s;k them, if they are not frightened when the vulcano rages, le&s;t it &s;hould carry away their hou&s;es, and they will tell you, no; &s;o as we can rai&s;e our vines and oranges again&s;t it for three years, (for it acts as a hot wall) our fortune is made, and the hou&s;e may go. If the red river comes, we can run away, and hang the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been di&s;covered, that the hou&s;es of the &s;ub|terranean city of Herculaneum, of which we &s;hall
<PB N="200" REF="214">
&s;peak more particularly hereafter, which was built more than two thou&s;and years ago, were erected on foundations of this lava; a manife&s;t proof that the great irruptions, of this mountain, are not all &s;ub|&s;equent to that which &s;wallowed up the city.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne</HI> is firmly of opinion that Ve&s;uvius has been rai&s;ed, from the level of the plains, by the &s;ole action of fire contained in its bowels. Indeed, the i&s;le of Rhodes, that of A&s;cen&s;ion, and many in the Archipelago, one which ro&s;e out of the &s;ea, in 1707, completely prove this a&s;&s;ertion. For what are i&s;lands but the tops of hills, ri&s;ing ju&s;t above the water, who&s;e ba&s;es are at the bottom of the deep; and of &s;uch a hill, who&s;e top does not emerge above the &s;urface, but lies a little below it, as a &s;hoal, &s;hould be &s;welled by &s;ubterranean fires, it would ri&s;e above the ocean, and become an i&s;land.</P>
<P>Half way up the mountain dwells a hermit, in an excavation of the lava, who profits &s;o much by tra|vellers climbing to its &s;ummit, that the vulcano mu&s;t rage indeed, before he thinks of quitting his retire|ment. Experience has taught him, when to expect an irruption, and be will foretel it with a &s;eeming plea&s;ure. Gentlemen &s;top here to regale, and for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to help them up. Sometimes here are three or four fellows attending for that purpo&s;e, who will
<PB N="201" REF="215">
contend, with their <HI>couteaus,</HI> for the honour of leading the way, and for the reward in con&s;equence. Fellows, that if you were not armed, would plunder you.</P>
<P>About eight miles from Ve&s;uvius, is a half-extinct vulcano, &s;tiled by the ancients, the Court of Vulcan; by the moderns Solfatara; though at &s;uch a di&s;tance from Ve&s;uvius, it has a &s;ubterraneous communication with that mountain. Its form is circular; hills of mo|derate elevation &s;urround it; and, notwith&s;tanding the vicinity of the fire, vines and fruit-trees grow very well on the outer declivity; the floor of the crater is white as chalk, a kind of marly clay. It has &s;e|veral fi&s;&s;ures, or cha&s;ms, that emit &s;moke, but it never flames. The more Ve&s;uvius rages, the quieter Sol|&s;atara is. The ground is every where hollow; for if a &s;tone be thrown upon it, or the ground be &s;truck with a hammer, a long &s;ubterraneous echo en&s;ues. If a large &s;tone be ca&s;t into one of the holes, which have been dug, the noi&s;e is little &s;hort of thunder. It &s;eems to be a vulcano burnt out, and &s;unk into it&s;elf, leav|ing a crater-like ground, inclo&s;ed with &s;ome remains of its &s;ides, &s;urrounding it in an amphitheatrical form.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood are two or three famous lakes. The fir&s;t is that of Agnano, lying in a valley, and about a mile in circumference. The water here,
<PB N="202" REF="216">
in many places, boils up to the height of two inches, without any &s;en&s;ible warmth. It breeds a great num|ber of wild ducks, and other water-fowl; and here the king &s;ometimes comes for the diver&s;ion of &s;hoot|ing. In a rock, near its banks, is the <HI>Grotta del Cane,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e a dog, on whom the experiment is commonly made, for half a crown (and &s;everal are left there for the purpo&s;e) forcibly held, with his no&s;e again&s;t the bottom, is &s;uffocated in a few minutes; but, if thrown within two minutes after into the lake, recovers; owing, no doubt, to the fre&s;h air. The&s;e &s;ulphureous exhalations, are al&s;o equally fatal to other animals. The &s;weating baths are certain cells, or chambers, in the grotto of lake Agnano; two of which have an aperture, each exhaling a very hot &s;team, &s;o as to throw a per&s;on in them into a very pro|fu&s;e &s;weat; u&s;ed in venereal ca&s;es, paralytic di&s;or|ders, gout, weakne&s;s of joints, and internal impo&s;t|humes.</P>
<P>The &s;econd lake is the Lucina, famous among the Romans for its fine oy&s;ters, and abundance of fi&s;h. It is now rather like a pond than a lake, having been filled up by a mountain, formed by an earthquake, in the night of the 19th of September, 1538. This mountain is five hundred perches high, and five Italian miles in circumference.</P>

As, therefore, the country is &s;o thinly inhabited, we find the towns &s;warming with people.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of Naples.</HEAD>
<P>NAPLES, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> is fabled to owe its foundation to a Siren; and idlene&s;s, that wor&s;t of Sirens, &s;eems to have &s;pread its baneful influence over this favourite city, which no length of time has been able to di&s;pel. It has never lo&s;t the &s;oft vo|luptuous character, which it may be &s;aid to have re|ceived from <HI>Parthenope,</HI> its &s;upernatural foundre&s;s. The Crimeans formed a &s;ettlement in this bay, about three hundred years after the Trojan war, and called it their new town, <HI>Neapolis.</HI> Naples, thus happily &s;itu|ated, grew rich and populous. It was, during a &s;hort &s;pace of time, the &s;eat of war, in the days of <HI>Hannibal;</HI> but, at almo&s;t, all other periods, enjoyed the mo&s;t pro|found
<PB N="205" REF="220">
peace, under the powerful dominions of the Ro|mans. It was &s;uffered to live under its municipal laws, wor&s;hip its peculiar deities, and retain its origi|nal rites and language. This indulgence was pur|cha&s;ed by a quota of &s;hips, to be furni&s;hed when de|manded. Thus maintained, in peace and &s;ecurity, Naples became the centre of polite arts, the &s;eat of re|fined ta&s;te and luxury, and a favourite re&s;idence of the rich and voluptuous citizens of Rome. The em|perors partook of the fa&s;hionable partiality for its climate, and gave it many &s;ub&s;tantial marks of their predilection. But the rougher policy of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> altered its con&s;titution, and made it a Roman colony. On the divi&s;ion of the empire, Naples was a&s;&s;igned to the Ea&s;tern monarch; and, being connected with Greece, by language and manners, long pre&s;erved its allegiance to that crown, under a kind of &s;ubordinate, republican government. It &s;uffered &s;everely from the Saracens, who invaded Italy about the beginning of the ninth century. King <HI>Roger,</HI> after the reduction of every other place that now belongs to the King of Naples, was voluntarily admitted here, aboli&s;hed the ducal government, and a&s;&s;umed the title of King of the two Sicilies. Naples, at this time, was large and &s;trong; but its bulwarks were demoli&s;hed by the em|peror <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and levelled to the ground by his grand&s;on, <HI>Conrad.</HI> The emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> II. father of <HI>Conrad,</HI> transferred the univer&s;ity of Bologne here,
<PB N="206" REF="221">
embelli&s;hed the city with new buildings, and repaired the old ones. <HI>Charles</HI> I. brother to <HI>Louis</HI> IX. of France, conquered it, and brought it to perfection, by fixing here his royal re&s;idence, and the tribunal of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But <HI>Charles</HI> I. was a tyrant. It was in his reign, 1269, that his ill u&s;age of his &s;ubjects provoked them to invite <HI>Conradine,</HI> the &s;on of their late king, who was al&s;o emperor of Germany, to the inheritance of his ance&s;tors. <HI>Conradine,</HI> the prince then in Germany, was a &s;pirited youth of &s;eventeen: he obeyed their &s;ummons; but unfortunately lo&s;t his life in the expedition. He was defeated, betrayed, taken pri&s;oner, and beheaded. <HI>Charles,</HI> at fir&s;t, con&s;ented he &s;hould be ran&s;omed; and &s;ent an expre&s;s to the empre&s;s <HI>Margaret,</HI> his mother, for that purpo&s;e; but the tyrant altered his mind afterwards, and put him to death, with <HI>Frederick</HI> of Au&s;tria, his cou&s;in, and com|panion in the enterpri&s;e. His afflicted mother arrived on the beach, with a va&s;t trea&s;ure for the ran&s;om of her &s;on and nephew, but found only lifele&s;s trunks to redeem from the hands of the barbarous conqueror. Their deaths did not remain long unrevenged. <HI>Charles,</HI> and his Frenchmen, rendered their yoke &s;o galling to the Sicilians, who&s;e honour, property, and lives, were become the &s;port of the licentious con|querors, that, on Ea&s;ter-Monday, 1282, the people

of Palermo rai&s;ed the &s;tandard of revolt; the whole i&s;land followed the example of the capital, and a gene|ral ma&s;&s;acre en&s;ued; in which every Frenchman, their wives and children, to the number of eight thou&s;and, one man only excepted, who was &s;pared for his virtue, was put to the &s;word without mercy; an event known in hi&s;tory, by the name of the Sicilian ve&s;pers. <HI>Charles</HI> died three years afterwards of a broken heart. The empre&s;s expended the money &s;he brought to ran&s;om her &s;on, in the erecting and beautifying the church of <HI>Maria del Carmine.</HI> Every &s;ucceeding prince added &s;omething to the embelli&s;hment of Naples, and it &s;oon came to vie with the fir&s;t cities in Europe, for beauty, wealth, and numbers; but ill provided for defence. It actually threw open its gates to every invader, and re|ceived with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, whatever commander was the conqueror, with &s;ome few exceptions only. In 1495, it was taken by <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. king of France; but in 1504, the French were expelled, and the crown fell to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> king of Spain; at who&s;e death it devolved on his grand&s;on, the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. During the time the Au&s;trian families were on the throne, it was governed by viceroys, and the peace of Naples was interrupted only by Turks, French, and a banditti, till the year 1647; when the famous in&s;urrection of Ma&s;&s;aniello broke out. This man was a fi&s;herman, who, on account of &s;ome duties laid on fruit, &s;tirred up the people, and found him&s;elf at the head of 150,000
<PB N="208" REF="225">
men, drove the viceroy into the ca&s;tle, ordered the heads of his oppo&s;ers to be &s;truck off before him, and &s;trutted about for a week, the dictator of the Neapo|litan republic. He required the viceroy, to aboli&s;h all taxes, and to deliver up the writ of exemption, granted by <HI>Charles</HI> V. near 100 years before. This embarra&s;&s;ed the viceroy; but to appea&s;e the people, he forged a deed, and &s;ent it by the favourite of the people, the duke of <HI>Matalone,</HI> whom he had confined. The fraud being di&s;covered, the duke was torn from his hor&s;e, maltreated by the mob, and afterwards com|mitted to pri&s;on. <HI>Ma&s;&s;aniello</HI> was a day or two after killed for his mi&s;conduct by his own party, and the rebellion was quelled.</P>
<P>Naples, the capital of the kingdom, anciently Par|thenope, lies in 41&deg; 29&prime; North latitude; is &s;ituated partly on the &s;ide of a mountain, and partly towards the &s;ea, lying in the form of an amphitheatre, with the bay before it. This is formed of two half circles, with a promontory in the middle, &s;o as to wear the &s;hape of the figure 3; the town ri&s;ing in an amphi|theatre behind it. It is large, the walls being nine Italian miles in circuit; but, including the &s;uburbs, the entire circumference cannot be le&s;s than eighteen miles. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are hand&s;omely paved; the hand&s;ome&s;t, and that of the greate&s;t length and breadth, is the <HI>Strada di Toledo.</HI> The breadth is twenty-three common paces; and, after running in a

direct line of fifteen hundred paces, it is continued in an ea&s;y curved line, for three hundred more; and yet has not one palace in the whole length of it. Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> &s;ays it is as &s;trait as Bond-&s;treet, London; as long as Oxford-road, very wide; the hou&s;es all of &s;tone, and at lea&s;t eight &s;tories high; in the heart of the city the &s;treets are narrow; and, on account of the height of the hou&s;es, gloomy. Over the &s;hops, live per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; but per&s;ons, of very high quality, have palaces in other parts of the city. Though it is not, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> one third of the &s;ize of London, the number of inhabitants are computed at 350,000. Many of the &s;treets are more crouded than the Strand. The &s;treets not being lighted or watched at night, is is a very dangerous place often after dark.</P>
<P>That which the police, and &s;ome remains of &s;hame re|&s;train, in other parts, e&s;pecially in cities, are here, above all the controul of law. The &s;ulphur, with which their vegetables and food are impregnated; the continual u&s;e of chocolate, and other laxatives, occa&s;ion nece&s;|&s;ities, which will admit neither delay nor circum&s;pec|tion; the court-yards of palaces and hotels, the por|ches of private hou&s;es, the &s;tairs and landing-places, are &s;o many conveniences for pa&s;&s;engers. Per&s;ons will often throw them&s;elves out of their coaches, and mingle with the foot-pa&s;&s;engers, every one taking

<Q>Veniam petimu&s;que damusque vice&s;&s;im.</Q>
<Q>"Begging pardon and granting it by turns."</Q>
<P>From this general liberty, and the little care taken by an owner or tenant, about the cleanline&s;s of his hotel, his hou&s;e, or landing-place, it is ea&s;ily to be &s;uppo&s;ed, what filthine&s;s and infection mu&s;t be in a city, &s;o populous as Naples.</P>
<P>There is, however, one plea&s;ure in walking through the city; the &s;treets being well paved, and kept in good order. No heavy loads on carriages are &s;uf|fered to be brought into town. The heavie&s;t cart is that which carries wine; all heavy burdens are brought on the backs of a&s;&s;es. Market-gardeners bring in their vegetables by this conveyance, and carry out their dung by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es have all flat roofs, paved with &s;tone, and a balu&s;trade, that one may &s;afely walk on them; numbers of flower-pots, and fruit-trees, in boxes, are placed on them, and produce a very gay effect. <HI>Gro&s;ley</HI> &s;ays they look like hou&s;es, who&s;e tops have been con&s;umed by fire, e&s;pecially as the upper part of the&s;e hou&s;es is blackened by &s;moke, and the va|pours

of the air, more than the middle parts. A great number of &s;talls, whereon eatables are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and of balconies, with lattice windows, take off from the beauty of the &s;treets; but they are hand&s;ome notwith&s;tanding. This city does not, in|deed, rival either Rome or Genoa, in &s;tately palaces; yet it can boa&s;t of fine ones, as al&s;o of a great number of fine fountains; though the water, in mo&s;t of them, is but indifferent. Water is al&s;o conveyed to the city, from the foot of Mount Ve&s;uvius, by a very grand aqueduct.</P>
<P>The mona&s;teries, and convents, of both &s;exes, are one hundred and forty-nine; be&s;ides which, are thirty-four hou&s;es for poor boys, girls, and women; eleven ho&s;pitals; five &s;eminaries, for eccle&s;ia&s;tics; four capital churches; thirty-two pari&s;h-churches; &s;eventy other churches and chapels, and upwards of one hundred and thirty oratories, or chapels of reli|gious fraternities. Mo&s;t of the churches are deficient in good paintings, and a fine front; and their marble monuments, are not of tho&s;e magnificent dimen&s;ions, as tho&s;e which &s;trike the eye at Rome; but every thing el&s;e, in beauty and richne&s;s, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all of the kind in other Catholic countries.

<P><PB N="212" REF="230"><HI>Il Duomo,</HI> or the archbi&s;hop's cathedral, though Gothic, is &s;urpri&s;ingly fine; it is dedicated to St. <HI>Ja|nuarius;</HI> and, in one of the chapels, is the tomb of that &s;aint: he was bi&s;hop of Benevonto, and is called the patron of the city. They &s;ay he was murdered, and that &s;ome of his blood is pre&s;erved in a gla&s;s phial, which they &s;hew; but more of this by-and-by. The dome of this cathedral is exceedingly rich, in all &s;orts of &s;culpture, painting, gilding, and marble. The high altar is &s;uperb, and its tabernacle &s;et with the fine&s;t gems. The mo&s;t remarkable thing, in this church, is a chapel called <HI>Il Te&s;ora;</HI> the architecture of which is extremely beautiful. In it are the &s;tatues of Saints <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> finely executed by <HI>Finelli;</HI> and two pillars of black marble, mo&s;t beautifully &s;potted. The door is of bra&s;s, curiou&s;ly wrought with fe&s;toons and foliage, and co&s;t thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and <HI>&s;cudi;</HI> each &s;cudi, 4s. 2d. The chapel is of a round form, and contains &s;even altars of the fine&s;t marble, and forty-two pillars of <HI>Broccatello.</HI> Round the upper part of the wall &s;tand twenty-one large bronze images of &s;aints, each valued at four thou&s;and &s;cudi; and, under them are &s;ixty large &s;ilver bu&s;ts, of &s;o many &s;aints. Mo&s;t of the&s;e bronzes are by <HI>Finelli.</HI> The cupola was painted by <HI>Lanfranco, Domenichini,</HI> and <HI>Parmeggiano,</HI> but the&s;e noble pieces have &s;uffered by earthquakes, that &s;hook the cupola. Behind the high altar, which is detached from the wall, and en|tirely

of red porphyry, is the &s;hrine with &s;ilver doors, where is kept the head of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> and the two phials of his blood.</P>
<P>In the area, between the cathedral and Capua &s;treet, &s;tands a fine marble obeli&s;k, on which is erected a bra&s;s &s;tatue of St. <HI>Januarius.</HI> This obeli&s;k is annu|ally illuminated, on the 19th of September, with a &s;plendour hardly to be conceived; whil&s;t a numerous band of mu&s;ic play by it, and all the guns, in the &s;eve|ral forts, are fired on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of the four catacombs, hitherto di&s;covered in Naples, tho&s;e of St. <HI>Januarius</HI> are both of the great|e&s;t extent, and be&s;t kept. This is a &s;ubterraneous burial-place, hewn out of a &s;olid rock; the pa&s;&s;ages are &s;ixteen feet high, and arched, and eleven wide. That the Romans buried their dead, long before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, is out of di&s;pute. The bodies, in the&s;e catacombs, were depo&s;ited in cavities, on both &s;ides of the vaults, one above another, in a kind of ovens; the mouths of which, when full, were clo&s;ed up with a marble &s;lab, or with tiles. There are pa&s;&s;ages branching out on each &s;ide, but the&s;e are nar|row. In many parts, they are &s;aid to extend &s;eve|ral miles, but they are now walled up; robberies, &amp;c. having been committed, by banditti, who u&s;ed to

<P>St. <HI>Maria Annunziata</HI> is one of the fine&s;t churches in Naples; for the eye every where meets with noble paintings, &s;tatues, monuments, <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievos,</HI> &amp;c. The gilding alone of the high altar, and the chapel belong|ing to it, co&s;t twenty-three thou&s;and crowns; and the other ornaments, enriched with <HI>lapis lazuli,</HI> corne|lian, ja&s;per, agate, and a profu&s;ion of other gems, eighteen thou&s;and ducats more, each ducat 3s. 4d. The plate, in the ve&s;try of this church, a few years &s;ince, weighed above twenty-one thou&s;and marks.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital called <HI>La Santa Ca&s;a,</HI> belonging to this church, was once the be&s;t endowed in the whole world. Its annual income, amounting to two hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. All this was expended on the &s;ick, poor, foundlings, and other charitable purpo&s;es. The children brought up here, are generally about two thou&s;and five hundred; it being no uncommon thing, in the night, for twenty infants to be put into the wheel, or machine, which &s;tands open, both day and night, for the reception of them; and eight wet nur&s;es attend every day. The boys are brought up to trade, and &s;ome to the church. The girls, according to their capacities, do the nece&s;&s;ary work of the ho&s;pital; are employed in
<PB N="215" REF="233">
the care and in&s;truction of the children; placed in a convent, or married off, with a portion of one hun|dred, or two hundred ducats. In &s;uch portions, ten thou&s;and ducats have been expended in one year; and fifteen thou&s;and foundlings maintained. If &s;uch women, as are married, become di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widows, or are de&s;erted by their hu&s;bands; or, in ca&s;e they are unhappy in &s;uch marriages, without any fault of theirs, they are re-admitted, and a particular apart|ment allowed them for life. The annual amount of the dowries to other women, with which this hou&s;e &s;tands charged, by &s;everal ancient legacies and foun|dations, was, at lea&s;t, eighteen thou&s;and ducats; there being many noble families, who&s;e daughters, at their marriage, received two or three thou&s;and dollars from this ho&s;pital. The phy&s;icians, &amp;c. &s;tood the hou&s;e, yearly, in fourteen thou&s;and ducats. To the <HI>Santa Ca&s;a</HI> belong four other ho&s;pitals, to which pa|tients are &s;ent, for the convenience of warm bathing, &amp;c. Such was the &s;tate of this ho&s;pital, at the begin|ning of this century, when it broke, for above five millions of ducats, on which its total ruin was feared; but it was, at la&s;t, brought before an imperial com|mi&s;&s;ion; when all its revenues, except forty-two thou|&s;and ducats a year, were made over to the creditors till they were paid; &s;o that the girls portions now are re|duced from two hundred ducats to fifty. Other ex|pences are proportionably dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="234">Here is al&s;o an in&s;titution, called <HI>Sacra Monte della Piet&agrave;;</HI> who&s;e revenue, amounting to fifty thou&s;and ducats, is, for two years, lent out on pledges without intere&s;t, in &s;ums not exceeding ten ducats. Many wealthy per&s;ons, who either want opportunity, or not being inclined to make purcha&s;es, or lend on intere&s;t, or mortgages, place their fortunes here; partly for &s;e|curity, and partly for the benefit of the poor.</P>
<P>The late king of Spain began a new palace at <HI>Capo di Monte,</HI> but, di&s;couraged by the difficulty of acce&s;s, and procuring water, he left it unfini&s;hed. Twenty-four rooms, however, of this neglected palace, are filled with the collection that was removed from Parma; con&s;i&s;ting of an invaluable &s;et of pictures, a library, a fine cabinet of medals, and a great number of cameos and intaglios, particularly an onyx <HI>tazza,</HI> eight inches in diameter; but none of the&s;e valuable articles are hung up, or properly di&s;po&s;ed. The books are unpacked, and all is in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the palace of the prince <HI>di Tar&s;ia</HI> is a library open for the public, three days in a week. There are &s;everal other good libraries, but the principal one is the king's.</P>
<P>Of all the palaces in Naples, that of the king's is the mo&s;t magnificent. In the audience-room, are finely
<PB N="217" REF="235">
painted the mo&s;t remarkable actions of the Spani&s;h nation. The <HI>&s;ala Regia,</HI> where the carnival enter|tainments are given, is hung with the portraits of all the viceroys at full length. A particular gallery is taken up with the exploits of the duke of Alva. In another &s;aloon is repre&s;ented the war carried on by <HI>Charles</HI> V. with <HI>John Frederick,</HI> elector of Saxony. In the palace-chapel is a &s;ubterraneous communica|tion (a good re&s;ource for viceroys and courtiers) to the <HI>Nuovo Ca&s;tello,</HI> by the &s;ea-&s;ide, which is well gar|ri&s;oned; forty-two pieces of ordnance are mounted on the walls and ba&s;tions; among which are &s;ome taken by <HI>Charles</HI> V. from the elector of Saxony, at the battle of Muhlberg.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;tello del Uovo,</HI> or Egg Ca&s;tle, &s;o called from its oval figure, &s;tands in the &s;ea upon a rock, joined to the continent by a bridge two hundred and twenty paces long. This ca&s;tle is &s;aid to have been anciently the palace of <HI>Lucullus.</HI> It is &s;upplied with fre&s;h water con|veyed under the bridge.</P>
<P>The third check, upon the city of Naples, is the ca&s;tle of St. Elmo. It is &s;ituated on an eminence, to|wards the We&s;t, and the plan is in the form of a &s;tar, with &s;ix rays. Its &s;ubterraneous works are very &s;pa|cious, and hewn out of a rock to &s;uch a depth, as to be bomb-proof; on which account, a great number of
<PB N="218" REF="236">
military &s;tores are here kept. It can al&s;o be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions from <HI>Ca&s;tello Nuovo,</HI> by means of a &s;ub|terraneous communication. In the upper part of St. Elmo's ca&s;tle are &s;even ci&s;terns of water; and, under the vaults and mines, is a re&s;ervoir large enough for two galleys to &s;ail on. The water, which is always extremely cold, is drawn up by a bucket, through a kind of aperture.</P>
<P>One of the plea&s;ante&s;t parts of the city is the <HI>Pi|aggie,</HI> that is, the Strand, from its proximity to the &s;ea-&s;hore. The coolne&s;s of the air, the agreeablene&s;s of the pro&s;pect, the extent of the area, and its freedom from du&s;t, make it the evening re&s;ort of the quality; &s;o that it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee &s;ome hundreds of coaches here; but, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, per&s;ons of different &s;exes never ride together in the &s;ame coach. Nothing can be more delightful than the gardens to the right-hand, on the hill, adorned with walks of orange, cedar, and palm-trees, and a profu&s;ion of the mo&s;t beautiful flowers.</P>
<P>The bay of Naples is thirty miles in circum|ference, and twelve miles acro&s;s. The harbour is very &s;pacious, and has a grand light-hou&s;e, with a mole, five hundred paces in length, which &s;eparates the main harbour from the ba&s;on. The latter is behind the New Ca&s;tle, and has generally in it four gallies; the
<PB N="219" REF="237">
crews of which, both rowers and &s;oldiers, are obliged every Lent, to come to confe&s;&s;ion, and receive the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>The harbour is formed by the mole, which pro|jects near half a mile into the &s;ea. It was begun to be built in 1302. It is in the form of a bending arm, and about &s;ixty feet broad, con&s;i&s;ting of large &s;tones, hewn and &s;quare, &s;o clo&s;ely cemented, that it &s;tands unmoveable like a rock, and braves the fury of the mo&s;t impetuous waves. In the middle of the elbow &s;tands the light-hou&s;e, a beautiful, lofty, round tower; at the end of the bending of the elbow, is a &s;mall fort. There is al&s;o a chapel, near the middle of the mole, where ma&s;s is duly &s;aid for ma|riners. The mole is broad enough for two coaches to go a-brea&s;t, and &s;ufficient room for them to turn at the end. It is the mo&s;t agreeable public walk about the city, and much frequented in &s;ummer evenings, by per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, to enjoy the <HI>fre&s;co,</HI> or refre&s;hing breezes from the &s;ea. On each &s;ide the mole, &s;hips and other ve&s;&s;els are chained; and from it is a beau|tiful pro&s;pect of Mount Ve&s;uvius, the delightful coun|try about Portici, and the beautiful a&s;cent of great part of Naples; the hou&s;es and gardens appearing one above another, almo&s;t to the ca&s;tle of St. Elmo. The company here have con&s;tantly concerts of the fine&s;t mu&s;ic; who&s;e &s;ounds are wonderfully &s;weet, in a &s;till evening, owing to the water; and add con&s;iderably
<PB N="220" REF="238">
to the plea&s;ures of the place. The harbour for the gallies will contain about twenty, defended by the old town of St Vincent, now u&s;ed as a place of con|finement, for di&s;obedient children.</P>
<P>Naples has &s;everal &s;quares, but they are &s;mall and irregular; many of them have, in the middle, a &s;hort obeli&s;k, loaded with decorations, far from plea&s;ing to the eye; but the fine&s;t is that of Medina, oppo&s;ite the new ca&s;tle. The upper ba&s;on is &s;upported by the three Graces; and, on the top, &s;tands a &s;uperb <HI>Neptune,</HI> attended by &s;everal other figures, all ejecting water. The town is well &s;upplied with daily markets, &s;o that provi&s;ions are ever fre&s;h, and in great plenty. Their wine is the be&s;t in Europe, and both fi&s;h and fle&s;h are extremely good. There are two or three good inns, for the ac|commodation of travellers. The apartments are in|different, but every thing el&s;e will be found good, and the cooks excellent; gentlemen may have a ready furni&s;hed lodging, &s;uch as it is, (for there are few better than what we meet with in the poor-hou&s;es of Shoreditch) and have their provi&s;ions from the inns. Wines are exceedingly cheap; nine gallons may be bought for 3s. 3d. and fellows, who &s;peak a little broken Engli&s;h, are ready as <HI>valet de places,</HI> to attend you every where; but they are much greater knaves here, than the generality of their fraternity.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="239">Some thou&s;ands of the populace, called the <HI>Laza|roni,</HI> or black-guards, have no other habitation than the &s;treets; and much the greater part of the other portion, having no employ, either from want of ma|nufactures, or their natural propen&s;ity to idlene&s;s, are &s;auntering in the &s;treets from morning to night, and make tho&s;e crowds at Naples; which are not &s;een in other places, but on fe&s;tivals, elections, and other public days.</P>
<P>The&s;e lazaroni, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> are computed at above thirty thou&s;and; and have, on &s;ome well known oc|ca&s;ions, as the in&s;urrection of <HI>Ma&s;&s;aniello,</HI> and others, had the government, for a &s;hort time, in their own hands. The greater part of them have no dwelling-hou&s;es, but &s;leep every night in the &s;treets, under porticos, piazzas, or any kind of &s;helter they can find. Tho&s;e, who have wives and children, live in the &s;uburbs, near Pau&s;ilippo, in huts, or in caverns; or chambers dug out of that mountain. Some get a livelihood by fi&s;hing, others by carrying loads to and from the &s;hipping. Many walk about the &s;treets, ready to run on errands, or perform any labour in their power, for a very &s;mall reward. As they do not meet with con&s;tant employ, their wages are not ade|quate to their maintenance; the &s;oup and bread, di&s;|tributed at the gates of convents, &s;upply the deficiency. The lazaroni are generally repre&s;ented as a lazy,

licentious, and turbulent &s;et of people; but Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> entertained a very different idea of their cha|racter. This idlene&s;s, &s;ays he, is evidently the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, not of choice; they are always ready to perform any work, however laborious, for a rea&s;on|able gratification. It mu&s;t proceed from the fault of government, when &s;uch a number of &s;tout, active citi|zens remain unemployed; and, &s;o far are they from being licentious and turbulent, that I cannot help thinking they are too tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. Though the inhabitants of the Italian cities were the fir&s;t who &s;hook off the feudal yoke; and though, in Naples, they have long enjoyed the privilege of municipal ju|ri&s;diction; the external &s;plendor of the nobles, and the authority they &s;till exerci&s;e on the pea&s;ants, impo&s;e upon the minds of the lazaroni; and, however bold and re&s;entful they may be, of injuries offered by others, they bear the in&s;olence of the nobility, as pa&s;|&s;ive as pea&s;ants fixed to the &s;oil. A coxcomb of a <HI>volanti,</HI> or running footman, tricked out in a fanta&s;tic dre&s;s, or any of the liveried &s;laves of the gue&s;ts, make no ceremony of treating the&s;e poor fellows with all the in&s;olence, and in&s;en&s;ibility natural to their ma&s;ters; and for no vi&s;ible rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he is dre&s;&s;ed in lace, and they in rags.

the running footman, is the u&s;ual warning they re|ceive. Nothing animates this people to in&s;urrection, but &s;ome very pre&s;&s;ing and very univer&s;al cau&s;es, &s;uch as &s;carcity of bread: every other grievance they bear, as if it was their charter. When we con&s;ider thirty thou&s;and human creatures, without beds, or habita|tions, wandering almo&s;t naked, in &s;earch of food, through the &s;treets of a well-built city; when we think of the opportunities they have of being together, and of comparing their own de&s;titute &s;ituation, with the affluence of others, one cannot help being a&s;to|ni&s;hed at their patience.</P>
<P>Let the prince be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;plendor and magnificence; let the great and the rich have their luxuries; but, in the name of humanity, let the poor, who are willing to work, have food in abundance, to &s;atisfy the cravings of nature; and raiment, to defend them from the inclemencies of the weather.</P>
<P>If their governors, whether through weakne&s;s, or neglect, do not &s;upply them with the&s;e, they certainly have a right to help them&s;elves. Every law of equity, and common &s;en&s;e, will ju&s;tify them in revolting again&s;t &s;uch governors; and in &s;atisfying their own wants, from the &s;uperfluities of lazy luxury.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="242">Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> gives us a very different idea of this &s;et of men; and &s;ays, that the natural indolence of the Neapolitans makes them regardle&s;s of the com|forts and inconveniences of life. As the weather is exceedingly warm, the lazaroni, who have but little care about appearances, go with a va&s;t deal of their per&s;ons uncovered, except that of tatooing their &s;houl|ders and legs, as do the Indians, with figures inde|libly marked in their &s;kin, by gunpowder, and other means. The man, who rows you about the delightful bay of Naples, has, perhaps, the angel <HI>Raphael,</HI> or the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> delineated, on one &s;un-burnt leg, the &s;aint of the town, upon the other; and the glory, or &s;even &s;pirits of God, upon his brawny &s;houlders. They hate work, &s;ays this lady, and why? Becau&s;e they want for nothing, having few de&s;ires. A hou&s;e would be an inconvenience to them; and, though many of them have decent clothes, they throw them off till a time of gala, and will &s;it by the &s;ea-&s;ide play|ing at moro, with their fingers.</P>
<P>A Florentine nobleman, continues Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> told me once, that he a&s;ked one of the&s;e fellows to carry his portmanteau for him, and offered him a <HI>carlini;</HI> more in proportion to a Neapolitan, than an Engli&s;h &s;hilling would be to a London porter; he had not twenty yards to go with it.

but what of that?&mdash;"Why, then, no more am I," was the an&s;wer, "and it is too hot weather to carry burthens;" and &s;o turned about on the other &s;ide and lay &s;till.</P>
<P>This cla&s;s of people, &s;ay this lady, amounting to a number that even terrifies one to think of, gives the city an air of gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s, one cannot help rejoicing in. The Toledo-&s;treet is one con|tinual crowd. Nothing can exceed the confu&s;ion to a walker; and here are little gigs, drawn by one hor&s;e, which, without any bit in his mouth, but a &s;tring tied over his no&s;e, tears along with inconceivable rapidity: a &s;mall narrow gilt chain to hold one, &s;et between the two wheels, and no &s;prings to it, nor any thing el&s;e which can add to the weight; and this flying car is a kind of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iacre,</HI> or hackney coach, that will travel a mile for fourpence halfpenny; or at the rate of a carlini, or four-pence halfpenny, an hour.</P>
<P>The coat of arms, belonging to Naples, was an unbridled hor&s;e; but one of their late kings put a bit into its mouth, as an emblem of his having brought the Neapolitans to &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>I have given my readers one rea&s;on, of the popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of the towns in the kingdom of Naples; that of the country places being de&s;erted. Another
<PB N="226" REF="244">
that fills Naples, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> is, that it furni&s;hes its own inhabitants, and, perhaps, is the only metropolis in Europe that does &s;o. London, Paris, and other chief cities, are &s;upplied with the people from the country; the luxury, and expen&s;ivene&s;s of large towns, being &s;o great an impediment to marriage, and popu|lou&s;ne&s;s, they would all, in the ordinary cour&s;e of na|ture, be depopulated in a few years, were they not an|nually recruited from other parts: but, in Naples, the ca&s;e is different, from a &s;ingular cu&s;tom among the gentry, in hiring married &s;ervants, in preference to unmarried ones. In Paris, or London, very few &s;er|vants can hope to be employed, who are not &s;ingle; and therefore an infinite number, of this cla&s;s of peo|ple, mu&s;t pa&s;s their lives in celibacy; as the in&s;tances in the&s;e cities are but rare, where footmen and maid-&s;ervants can &s;upport them&s;elves, after marriage, by a different occupation.</P>
<P>But in Naples, it is almo&s;t an univer&s;al fa&s;hion, to give their men-&s;ervants board-wages, not admitting them to &s;leep in their hou&s;es. This naturally in|duces them to marry, giving them a &s;ettlement &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to the character acquired here, by all ranks of ma&s;ters; but what &s;eems &s;till more to facilitate ma|trimony, in this order of people, is the prodigious number of young women, ready to accept the fir&s;t offer; for, in Italy, they are not taken into &s;ervice as
<PB N="227" REF="245">
in England, A nobleman, who keeps forty men &s;er|vants, has &s;eldom more than two maids; and, indeed, it is &s;o much the province of the men, to do the hou&s;e-bu&s;ine&s;s, that they are employed all over the country, even to the making of the beds. This circum&s;tance, with the difficulty &s;he has to acquire her living here, by any other means, is the rea&s;on why they &s;eldom make an objection to the certain poverty attending on marriage. The &s;warms of children, in all the &s;treets inhabited by the poor, are &s;uch as will naturally re&s;ult from this practice; and as a married couple, though they have &s;ix or &s;even children, never occupy more than one room; the extreme populou&s;ne&s;s of Naples mu&s;t con&s;equently follow from &s;uch cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The lazaroni are &s;uch mi&s;erable wretches, as are not to be &s;een in any other town in Europe. Per|haps, among the a&s;hes of our gla&s;s-hou&s;es in London, we may find two or three beggars not unlike them; and they are &s;uffered to &s;un them&s;elves a great part of the day, under the palace-walls, where they lie ba&s;king like dirty &s;wine, and are a much more nau&s;eous &s;pec|tacle. Being almo&s;t naked, they &s;uffer extremely in cold weather; and were the climate le&s;s mild, they would certainly peri&s;h; even the greater part of the poor, who work for their livelihood, &s;eldom wear &s;hoes or &s;tockings, and their children never; but, notwith&s;tanding the power of u&s;e, the cold in the
<PB N="228" REF="246">
winter months produces chilblains, and &s;ore legs, to a piteous degree.</P>
<P>To give my readers an idea of the &s;tarving life of the poor, I &s;hall only mention the wages of &s;ervants, to which all kinds of wages are nearly proportionate. A Neapolitan gentleman pays his footman five ducats a month; a nobleman, perhaps &s;ix. All the quality, who keep pages, give them &s;ix or &s;even ducats, with a livery once in two years, and another for gala days only, which la&s;ts ten years; but neither &s;hoes, &s;tock|ings, nor wa&s;hing. With this &s;um they &s;ub&s;i&s;t them|&s;elves and families; for this pay includes board wages; nor are the tables of the gentry &s;o amply provided here, as to admit of the lea&s;t depredation, as is the ca&s;e in England, where married &s;ervants generally maintain their wives from their ma&s;ter's larder. Now, a ducat is about 3s. 9d. five of which make &s;ome|thing le&s;s than 19s. the whole monthly income of the greater number of livery &s;ervants in Naples. The cu&s;tom of vails is, in a manner, unknown, except by great chance, or at the beginning of the year, when they receive a few trifling perqui&s;ites. The genera|lity of &s;ervants, marrying very young, their wives, for the mo&s;t part, ble&s;t with a numerous progeny, the cares of which are a &s;ufficient occupation for the wi&s;e, makes it that the labour of her hands can add but little to their &s;tock. The rent of a room, for a month, is a
<PB N="229" REF="247">
ducat, which leaves exactly fifteen &s;hillings for cloath|ing and maintaining the whole family. After this de|tail, it will not appear &s;trange that they &s;eldom eat either meat, or fre&s;h fi&s;h, but find them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of feeding chiefly on vegetables, a cheap &s;ort of chee&s;e, &s;alt fi&s;h, and a coar&s;e bread; which la&s;t is as dear at Naples, as at London. If it excites won|der, how they contrive to live on the&s;e wages, it is &s;till more &s;o, how it is contrived on four ducats, or four and a half, the u&s;ual price given by lawyers and trade&s;men; for every one here has the rage of keep|ing a footman, down to a &s;et of hou&s;ekeepers, who hire one for the Sunday only; and there are tho&s;e who hire one on that day, for an hour or two only, &s;o that &s;ome &s;ervants will let them&s;elves out to three or four different ma&s;ters on the &s;ame Sunday, one in the morning, another at noon, and a third after dinner, and &s;o on. This cla&s;s of &s;ervants are wittily called <HI>Domenichini,</HI> or Sunday-men; <HI>Domenica</HI> &s;ignifying Sunday. I mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve, that in great families, a few of the upper &s;ervants are not at board-wages, but are dieted by their ma&s;ters, for the con|venience of con&s;uming what remains at table.</P>
<P>The king's footmen receive only eight ducats, and &s;ix carlines a month, equal to 1l. 12s. 6d. and two carlines a day extraordinary, when his maje&s;ty is at any of his palaces out of Naples. This extraordinary
<PB N="230" REF="248">
allowance is granted them, for their particular main|tenance, as they cannot partake of the &s;ame dinner with their wives and families.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this account of the lowne&s;s of &s;ervants' wages, with remarking, that they all prefer a carline (fourpence halfpenny) a day, for board-wages, to the being maintained by their ma&s;ters; by which one may judge, with what vile provi&s;ion they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. They know nothing of the &s;uperfluities &s;o common among&s;t our poor; I mean the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong and &s;pirituous liquors, a matter of &s;uch notoriety, that I do not remember to have &s;een in the &s;treets, one drunken man or woman, if I may except a few &s;oldiers, and a few valets-de-place. Indeed, the cu&s;tom, or &s;pirit of &s;obriety, is rooted &s;o deeply in their manners, that the luxury they indulge, is a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;now, or ice-water, and lemonade. You &s;ee the very dregs of the mob, &s;pending their farthings, or halfpenny, on a gla&s;s of tho&s;e liquors, in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year; the &s;ame thing is practi&s;ed by the great, in a more elegant and expen&s;ive manner. Perhaps the heat of the climate may have indicated this luxury fir&s;t, in the &s;ummer months, but it is now become one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and government has availed it&s;elf of the fa&s;hion, by making a monopoly of the &s;now at Naples, and &s;elling it at a very high price, about three farthings a pound.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="249">It is this cheapne&s;s of &s;ervants that accounts for the &s;howy appearance &s;ome of the quality here make with &s;mall fortunes; but what enables them al&s;o to &s;upport a large hou&s;ehold, and a va&s;t quantity of coach-hor&s;es and carriages, is the circum&s;tance of confining them&s;elves to that one luxury. They have no expen&s;ive country-hou&s;es and gardens, no hounds, no race-hor&s;es, no parliament elections; and, in &s;hort, no great demands for the education of their children; di&s;po&s;ing of all the girls in convents, on very ea&s;y terms, whil&s;t they are children, where they are left all their lives, unle&s;s they provide them hu&s;bands; for &s;ingle young ladies are not &s;uffered to appear in the world, neither at &s;pectacles, nor vi&s;its. The &s;mall expence of their tables, al&s;o, is another means of enabling them to figure away with equipages. It is not u&s;ual here, to dine or &s;up at each others hou&s;es; and there are &s;ome who never do, except only on Chri&s;tmas-day, or, perhaps, during that week; nay, in general, are they &s;o unaccu&s;tomed to entertain one another, that the greater number &s;eldom receive their friends, but upon weddings, deaths, and lyings-in. They al&s;o carry their par&s;imony &s;o far, as to lock up their fine furniture, in the intervals of the&s;e ceremo|nies. It is amazing, at how &s;mall an expence the ge|nerality of the fir&s;t people live here, as to their table. It is not an uncommon thing, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> to contract with the cook, or one of the upper &s;ervants, to &s;upply
<PB N="232" REF="250">
their dinners at &s;o much a-head; and, I &s;hall &s;carcely be credited, when I mention &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as nine|pence Engli&s;h, wine included; neverthele&s;s, this is a practice not only at Naples, but at Rome, and other parts of Italy; and is a fact that may be depended on. There are, however, a few exceptions among&s;t the no|bility, to this retired manner of eating. There are &s;ome, who, when they entertain, give the mo&s;t &s;plen|did, expen&s;ive, and elegant dinners that can be con|ceived. The prince of <HI>Franca Villa,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> was there, in 1765, kept a kind of open table every night, with twelve or fourteen covers; where the Engli&s;h, of any con&s;equence, were at all times re|ceived with the greate&s;t politene&s;s. Though it be not the cu&s;tom to dine or &s;up with one another, except on ex|traordinary occa&s;ions, their vi&s;its being merely conver|&s;ations; &s;ome few exert them&s;elves to give balls, and even &s;ome of the merchants adopt this practice.</P>
<P>Now I am mentioning vi&s;its, it may be worth noticing a certain tire&s;ome etiquette, prevailing in this place, of waiting in the &s;treets, on evening vi&s;its, till two pages give in your name, and bring down flambeaux to light you up &s;tairs, perhaps almo&s;t to the top of the hou&s;e, as the quality live generally a great height from the ground. All this par&s;imony, in other re&s;pects, enables them, I &s;ay, to figure away with equipages, and that they do, more than in any other place in the
<PB N="233" REF="251">
world. Some of their princes have forty or fifty coach-hor&s;es; more than twenty different carriages; thirty, forty, or fifty dome&s;tic pages; be&s;ides four, five, or &s;ix running footmen, before their chariots. A running footman &s;eems almo&s;t an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ary of life here; for a gentleman never rides po&s;t, on the road near Naples, nor takes an airing, that is not preceded by one of the&s;e poor breathle&s;s fellows. They are u&s;eful, indeed, in the &s;treets; for, owing to the continual noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of the people, many of them would be run over, if it was not for the&s;e men, to bid them get out of the way.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the dukes and princes here, two or three excepted, are not equal to tho&s;e of our Engli&s;h nobility. The prince of <HI>Franca Villa's</HI> is about thirteen thou&s;and pounds a year; and no prince makes a greater appearance at Naples than him. The emoluments of the great officers of &s;tate, and the &s;alaries of all the king's &s;ervants, are much &s;maller than in England. The fees, al&s;o, of lawyers and phy&s;icians, are trifling, compared with ours; and talents, of every kind, are but poorly recompen&s;ed; &s;o that affluence is not diffu&s;ed, through every &s;treet, as in London; but is confined almo&s;t within the narrow circle of the nobility. The lord-&s;teward, lord chamberlain, and ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, have each eighteen hundred ducats a year, not three hundred and fifty pounds
<PB N="234" REF="252">
&s;terling; and about &pound;1. 6s. a day, for their table, when the king is not at Naples. The ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e has likewi&s;e a coach and &s;ix, two running foot|men and two footmen, at the king's expence. The lords of the bed-chamber have but thirty ducats a month, which is about &s;eventy pounds a year; and thirteen &s;hillings a day for their table, when the king is ab&s;ent: and there are no perqui&s;ites annexed to the&s;e offices. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at, that &s;o many of the nobles, with &s;mall e&s;tates, though they have a place at court, are obliged to live retired, not|with&s;tanding the low prices of provi&s;ions and la|bour.</P>
<P>The royal palace forms a &s;quare, with a court in the middle; has a noble &s;tair-ca&s;e, which takes up one &s;ide. The front is grand, and well executed; the architecture is bold and noble, done by <HI>Fontana,</HI> and originally intended as a palace for the viceroys, when under the Spani&s;h government. A theatre is built in this palace, very commodious for operas. All the apartments abound in fine paintings, and beau|tiful tape&s;try. The cielings have gold grounds, with white ornaments. There are red and white marble frames to the doors, with figures and gilt plates on them. The gardens reach to the &s;ea-&s;ide, but are nothing extraordinary. There is always here a &s;plen|did court, and the nobility exceed tho&s;e of the court
<PB N="235" REF="253">
of France, in their dre&s;&s;es and equipages. When a lady of quality goes there, &s;he is conducted in the following manner: &s;he &s;ets out alone in a gilded coach, with gla&s;s windows behind as well as before. This is preceded by another neat coach, in which &s;its a per&s;on, genteely dre&s;&s;ed, called her <HI>Braceira,</HI> who hands her in and out of her coach. Another coach follows, wherein are four pages, or more, ac|cording to her rank; and a rich &s;edan chair is carried empty, by two chairmen, near the &s;ide of her coach. When they reach the palace, the braceira gets out, and hands the lady into her &s;edan; the pages walk|ing, two and two, on each &s;ide, richly dre&s;&s;ed. In this manner &s;he is carried up &s;tairs, where &s;he quits her &s;edan, and the pages &s;upport her train, which is &s;ome yards in length, till &s;he comes to the drawing-room door, when it is buttoned up with loops. The braceira and pages wait her return, in the anti-cham|ber, when &s;he is re-conducted to her coach. It is re|marked that, though the Neapolitan ladies dre&s;s them|&s;elves to great advantage, they are not &s;o beautiful in appearance, as tho&s;e at Florence and Rome. The &s;tate coach of the king is &s;aid to have co&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds, and is the mo&s;t magnificent in Europe. It is very large, and richly gilt, even the tire round the wheels. It is u&s;ually drawn by &s;ix noble black hor&s;es, who&s;e harne&s;s is extremely rich, and the reins of broad, &s;olid gold-lace; the carved work is the fine&s;t
<PB N="236" REF="254">
imaginable, and the painting &s;o extraordinary, that nothing can exceed it. In&s;tead of iron or bra&s;s, the&s;e parts, as well as the ornaments, are &s;ilver, and &s;ilver gilt.</P>
<P>There is not, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> a city in all the world, with the &s;ame number of inhabitants, in which &s;o few &s;eem to contribute to the wealth of the community, by u&s;eful or productive labour, as Naples; but the number of prie&s;ts, monks, fidlers, lawyers, nobility, footmen and lazaroni, &s;urpa&s;s all rea&s;onable proportion. The king of Naples counts a hundred per&s;ons, among his &s;ubjects, with the title of prince; a &s;till greater num|ber, with that of duke. Six or &s;even of the&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> have from ten to twelve, or thirteen hundred pounds a year; a con&s;iderable number have fortunes about half that value, and the annual revenue of many, is not above one or two thou&s;and pounds. With re&s;pect to the inferior orders of nobility, they are much poorer. Many counts and marqui&s;&s;es, have not above three or four hundred pounds of paternal e&s;|tate; many &s;till le&s;s, and &s;ome few enjoy a title with|out any e&s;tate whatever; and yet many of them make a very &s;plendid appearance. I dined once, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> with the duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> at prince <HI>Iacci</HI>'s; we pa&s;&s;ed through twelve or thirteen large rooms, before we arrived at the dining-room. There were thirty-&s;ix per&s;ons at table, and each gue&s;t had a foot|man
<PB N="237" REF="255">
behind his chair. Other dome&s;tics, belonging to the prince, remained in the adjacent rooms, and in the hall. We afterwards pa&s;&s;ed through a number of other rooms, in our way to one, where there was a commanding pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>When there is no opera, the <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> or &s;ea-&s;hore, is the great &s;cene of Neapolitan parade. The fine&s;t car|riages are painted, gilt, varni&s;hed, and lined, in a richer and more beautiful manner, than are yet become fa&s;hionable either in England or France. They are often drawn by &s;ix, &s;ometimes by eight hor&s;es; two running footmen, gaily dre&s;&s;ed, precede the carriage; and three or four hand&s;ome &s;ervants, in rich liveries, hang behind. The ladies and gentlemen, within the coaches, glitter in all the brilliancy of lace, embroi|dery, and jewels. The carriages, for gala days, are purpo&s;ely made, with very large windows, that tho&s;e within may be &s;een. Nothing can be more &s;howy than the harne&s;s of the hor&s;es; their heads and manes are ornamented with the rare&s;t plumage, and their tails &s;et off with ribbands, and artificial flowers, in &s;uch a graceful manner, as leads us to think they were dre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who dre&s;&s;ed their ladies.</P>
<P>After all, you will imagine, perhaps, the amu&s;e|ment cannot be very great. The carriages follow each other in two lines, moving in oppo&s;ite directions.

The company within &s;mile and bow, and wave the hand, as they pa&s;s and repa&s;s their acquaintance; and, doubtle&s;s, imagine them&s;elves the mo&s;t important figures in the proce&s;&s;ion. The hor&s;es, however, &s;eem to be of a very different way of thinking; and to con|&s;ider them&s;elves as the chief objects of admiration, looking on the livery-&s;ervants, the volanti's, lords and ladies, as their natural &s;uite, on all &s;uch &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>Under an appearance of giddine&s;s, levity, and mer|riment, the commonalty and citizens, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> amid&s;t labour and plea&s;ure, conceal deep and well-conducted views, if not in every head, at lea&s;t as a body; and as a body, they form a democracy, inde|pendent of the king, and of the nobility, joining with the latter, when their intere&s;t &s;o requires. The lower clergy, and the majority of monks, with whom Naples &s;warms, never fail &s;iding with them.</P>
<P>The citizens of Naples, thus, form a &s;ociety of their own, perfectly di&s;tinct from the nobility; and, al|though they are not the mo&s;t indu&s;trious people in the world, yet, having &s;ome degree of occupation, and their time being divided between bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure, they, probably, have more enjoyment than tho&s;e who, without internal re&s;ources, or opportu|nities
<PB N="239" REF="257">
of active exertion, pa&s;s their lives in &s;en&s;ual gratifications.</P>
<P>The great theatre of St. Carlo, adjoining to the royal palace, is va&s;t, noble, and elegant; as in de|&s;cribing this, we &s;hall de&s;cribe every other Italian theatre, they being all built on the &s;ame plan, we will be the more particular. The form is a truncated el|lip&s;e, a&s;toni&s;hingly &s;pacious, having &s;ix rows of boxes all round the hou&s;e, &s;imilar to the new opera-hou&s;e in London; thirty in each row, except the two lowe&s;t, out of which the king's box is taken, and this is fronting the &s;tage, and occupies four of them, and is on a level with the &s;econd range, or row. Each of the&s;e boxes, like a room, is furni&s;hed with a table, pier-gla&s;s, ta|pe&s;try, carpet, canopy, branches, &amp;c. is large enough to hold twelve per&s;ons &s;tanding; but they are &s;o nar|row, that only three ladies can &s;it in front; the three next behind them, to &s;ee, mu&s;t &s;tand up, &s;o that all tho&s;e behind the&s;e can &s;ee little or nothing. The king's is a &s;aloon, and large enough to contain the royal fa|mily, and part of the court. The orche&s;tra will hold two hundred performers. The pit contains fifteen rows of &s;eats, thirty in a row, &s;eparated by broad re&s;ts for the elbow, like arms of a chair; be&s;ides an in|terval all through the middle, and a circuit all round under the boxes, which will hold one hundred and fifty per&s;ons &s;tanding. The &s;eat of each chair, in the pit,
<PB N="240" REF="258">
lifts up like the lid of a box, and has a lock to fa&s;ten it. There are gentlemen &s;ufficient in Naples to hire, by the year, the fir&s;t four rows next to the orche&s;tra, who take the key of the &s;eat home with them, leaving it locked, by which means they are always &s;ure of their place at any hour; and, as the intervals, between the rows, are wide enough to permit per&s;ons to pa&s;s, with|out di&s;turbing others, they are exceedingly conve|nient. The u&s;ual price for the &s;ea&s;on, in which they give four new operas, is twenty ducats, about 3l. 15s. Tho&s;e who do not hire &s;eats by the year, pay three carlines, about thirteen-pence-halfpenny, for their place in the pit.</P>
<P>The price of a box, for the whole year, is two hun|dred and forty ducats, or near 47l. or a le&s;s price in proportion to the length of the &s;ea&s;on. The three lower ranges are hired by ladies of di&s;tinct on, for a year; the other three are let out by the night; but, they mu&s;t hire the whole box; yet, if any &s;ingle &s;tranger wi&s;hes admittance, they are, if properly re|commended, invited into the boxes of the nobility. The nobility will let their boxes, when they do not go them&s;elves; and often, on gala nights, or at the opening of a new opera, will do the &s;ame; for which they will get an exorbitant price, &s;ometimes fifteen ducats, or more. It is common not only to receive company in the&s;e boxes, but to take ice and other re|fre&s;hments,
<PB N="241" REF="259">
to &s;up and play at cards; for the &s;ize of the theatre, and the noi&s;e of the audience are &s;uch, that the performers and band are but indi&s;tinctly heard, except when a favourite air is &s;inging; but, indeed, the opera is con&s;idered more as a place of rendezvous, than otherwi&s;e; and this imperfection is not much attended to. The &s;ea&s;on generally la&s;ts from the fifth of November, to the beginning of Sep|tember.</P>
<P>The decorations of the theatre, in&s;tead of being like &s;cenes, repre&s;ent &s;ome public place, the in&s;ide of a temple, or palace; the whole on three large pieces; two along the &s;ides, and one in front, in which pain|ters di&s;play all the magic of per&s;pective. It is the cu&s;tom in Italy, to light the &s;tage only, which renders the hou&s;e dark and gloomy; but, on gala nights, or when the king is pre&s;ent, it is &s;uperbly illuminated. The large gla&s;s in the front of each box, again&s;t which two wax lights, as large as torches, are placed, and other lights in the boxes, and on the &s;tage, properly di&s;po&s;ed, make the hou&s;e brilliant; but the glare and the &s;moke is, on the other hand, offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Dark as the boxes are, they would be much more &s;o, if tho&s;e who &s;it in them, did not, at their own ex|pence, put up a couple of candles. The ladies, in the boxes and pit of the opera-hou&s;e in London, make a
<PB N="242" REF="260">
more brilliant appearance, than in the boxes at Naples; where, on common nights, it is not po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h a feature acro&s;s the hou&s;e. The gen|tlemen in the pit do not, in the whole, make a good figure; for, though there are many officers well dre&s;t, and other gentlemen, yet the major part of the com|pany are &s;habby; con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons who pay nothing, &s;uch as the upper &s;ervants of ladies who hire boxes; upper &s;ervants of amba&s;&s;adors; and, &s;ome|&s;ometimes, for a &s;mall fee to the door-keepers, &s;uch &s;ervants gain admi&s;&s;ion for friends. The hou&s;e and the &s;tage is &s;o large, that, in windy weather, you would imagine your&s;elf in the &s;treet, (the wind blowing &s;o hard in the pit and boxes) and it often occa&s;ions colds.</P>
<P>The performers are not paid &s;o liberally at Naples, as at London; but, con&s;idering the difference in the price of things, the pay of the capital &s;ingers does not fall much &s;hort of it. <HI>Gabrielli</HI> had eighteen hundred &s;equins, or nine hundred pounds &s;terling. The fir&s;t man has three thou&s;and five hundred ducats; the fir&s;t dancer two thou&s;and; the fir&s;t woman dancer fifteen hundred, each ducat about three &s;hillings and ten|pence &s;terling.</P>
<P>The <HI>Impre&s;&s;ario,</HI> or manager, is bound to very hard terms, &s;o that his profits are incon&s;iderable. The theatre being part of the palace, the king re&s;erves
<PB N="243" REF="261">
for him&s;elf, and officers, fifteen boxes, without paying any thing; and the junto, deputed by his maje&s;ty, to &s;upervi&s;e the opera, re&s;erve to them&s;elves a right of nominating &s;ingers and dancers, which obliges the managers, &s;ometimes, to pay them an exorbitant price; and, to add to the misfortune, the nobility here, as in England, are &s;low of pay, and a manager mu&s;t not compel them. The women-dancers, by an order from court, are obliged to wear black drawers.</P>
<P>The exhibition is variegated by marches, battles, triumphs, all in the mo&s;t grand execution. Battles are fought between numerous fencing-ma&s;ters, in rich uniforms, and who appear all really fighting; the cla&s;h|ing of their weapons keeping time with the orche&s;tra. The&s;e battles are not without their cavalry and mount|ed on hor&s;es from the king's &s;tables, or tho&s;e of the fir&s;t nobility. In triumphs, the car is drawn by the king's fine&s;t-hor&s;es, capari&s;oned by the manager. The in|tervals between the acts, are filled up with ballets to French mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Compo&s;ers labour to rival each other in the mu&s;ic of the operas; and thus, frequently, the &s;ame piece is &s;et &s;everal times to mu&s;ic. In <HI>Meta&s;tatio's Demophoon,</HI> &s;et by the celebrated <HI>Sa&s;&s;one;</HI> the arietta <HI>Mi&s;ero Par|goletto,</HI> in which <HI>Timante</HI> &s;peaks to his &s;on, whom he holds in his arms, the expre&s;&s;ion is of that nature,
<PB N="244" REF="262">
as to draw tears from the whole audience. Clapping, in Italy, is a &s;ignal for an <HI>encore;</HI> of cour&s;e, they never clap, unle&s;s they wi&s;h to have the &s;inging re|peated; and this is &s;ometimes done to a fifth or &s;ixth time; and, in the&s;e repetitions it is, that the &s;inger exerts every re&s;ource of nature and art, to &s;urpa&s;s him&s;elf in each repetition, by the variety of gradations, which he introduces into the trills, modulations, and whatever belongs to the expre&s;&s;ion. Slight and quick as &s;ome of the&s;e gradations may be, not one of them e&s;capes an Italian ear; they perceive them, they feel them, they reli&s;h them with a delight, in Italy, called, "The foreta&s;te of the joys of Paradi&s;e;" where, we hope, there will be others equivalent for tho&s;e nations, equally good; but, who&s;e organs are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to the powers of harmony.</P>
<P>There are two other theatres, in which comic operas are performed, without dances; and there is a neat little play-hou&s;e, in which they act comedies. All the theatres are open on Saturday and Sunday evenings, and each of them once in the week, be|&s;ides.</P>
<P>The playhou&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> is hardly better than a cel|lar, and is u&s;ually called <HI>Cantina,</HI> (cellar) being ten &s;teps down from the &s;treet into the pit, which holds &s;eventy or eighty people, when crouded; the price a carline, four-pence
<PB N="245" REF="263">
halfpenny. There is a gallery round the pit, turn|ed into ten or twelve boxes, each holding four; the price eight carlines for the box. At &s;uch a price, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;cenes, dre&s;&s;es, actors, and decorations, mu&s;t be indifferent. It will not, how|ever, be &s;o ea&s;y to imagine the &s;habbine&s;s of the au|dience, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of men, in dirty caps and wai&s;tcoats, in the pit; for the boxes are gene|rally empty. All the Italian gentlemen and ladies &s;pit, and indelicately; not in their handkerchiefs, or in a bye corner; but, in the cantina, they &s;pit all about them, on the walls, on your cloaths; and their na&s;ti|ne&s;s is offen&s;ive to the la&s;t degree: the exhibition is little better than buffoonery, ju&s;t as we &s;ee practi&s;ed in England by <HI>Merry Andrews,</HI> on the &s;tages of moun|tebanks, and on the out&s;ide of booths, at Bartholo|mew-fair.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t re&s;pectable cla&s;s of citizens are com|prehended the lawyers; of whom there are incredible numbers in this town. The mo&s;t eminent of this pro|fe&s;&s;ion hold, indeed, a kind of intermediate rank, between the nobility and citizens; the re&s;t are on a level with the phy&s;icians, the principal merchants, and the arti&s;ts; none of whom, with all their indu&s;try, can make great fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="264">But the&s;e citizens having fewer avocations, and no public walks, or gardens, where they re&s;ort, are more frequently &s;een &s;auntering and conver&s;ing in the &s;treets. In London and Paris, the people who fill the &s;treets are mere pa&s;&s;engers, hurrying from place to place, on bu&s;ine&s;s. They make no &s;top. Whil&s;t you &s;it in your chamber, in either of the&s;e cities, the u&s;ual noi&s;e you hear from the &s;treets is, that of the car|riages; but at Naples, where they talk with uncom|mon vivacity, and where whole &s;treets, full of talkers, are in continual employment; the noi&s;e of carriages is completely drowned, in the aggregated clack of human voices. In the mid&s;t of all this idlene&s;s fewer riots, or outrages of any kind happen, than might be expected in any town, where the police is far from being &s;trict; and where &s;uch multitudes of poor unemployed people meet together, every day; a proof, that the national character of the Itali|ans is quietne&s;s, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and good order; and partly to the common people, being univer&s;ally &s;ober.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> &s;ays, that when a Neapolitan does not know what to do with him&s;elf, he tumbles over his papers, in order to &s;tart a law-&s;uit; for bow, other|wi&s;e, would the many thou&s;ands of lawyers be &s;up|ported in this capital? The fir&s;t time Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> went to their <HI>vicaria,</HI> that is, their We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, he was
<PB N="247" REF="265">
mortified in having &s;et out &s;o late from home, finding the &s;treet crowded with advocates, in their way to dinner; but, notwith&s;tanding the difficulty he had of threading the multitude, who were pouring out in &s;uch numbers, he found, when he had pu&s;hed into the hall, almo&s;t as much pre&s;&s;ing, as is u&s;ually met with the fir&s;t night of a new play at the London theatres.</P>
<P><HI>Northall</HI> informs us, that the inhabitants of Naples are divided into <HI>Titolati Mobili de Seggio, Nobilita fuori de Seggi, Civilta,</HI> and <HI>Plebe.</HI> To the fir&s;t order belong the princes and nobility; to the &s;econd, all the natives of the country, with all &s;trangers &s;ettled at Naples, and living in a noble manner; in the third, are ranked doctors in all &s;ciences, lawyers, notaries, officers of the courts of judicature, phy&s;icians, ban|kers, jewellers, gold&s;miths, &s;ilk-merchants, and book-&s;ellers; the fourth cla&s;s, comprehends all the re&s;t of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Naples, with re&s;pect to its municipal police, is di|vided into &s;ix <HI>&s;eggis,</HI> or wards, five of which are go|verned by a committee of nobles; the other belongs to the plebeians, and is di&s;tributed into twenty-nine quarters, under the direction of an <HI>Eletto,</HI> or mayor. The&s;e wards meet in open porticos, which alternately have the honour of being the theatre where, in the
<PB N="248" REF="266">
month of May, the blood of St. <HI>Januarius</HI> is liqui|fied, as will be &s;poken of hereafter.</P>
<P>The city having, as has been ob&s;erved, neither watchman nor lamps, one father <HI>Rocco,</HI> a Dominican, has per&s;uaded the people to &s;ub&s;cribe oil for lamps, to burn before images; he fixes the&s;e up in the mo&s;t convenient places, and thus turns their devotion to public account.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions, I have ob&s;erved, are plentiful and cheap; poultry, game, and fi&s;h, are abundant; fruit and ve|getables are to be had all the winter. The wants of na|ture are &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, &s;ays <HI>Marlyn,</HI> that the lower cla&s;s of people work but little; their great plea&s;ure is to ba&s;k in the &s;un, and do nothing. The lazaroni wallow about like &s;wine. Per&s;ons of a middle rank pa&s;s much of their time in coffee-hou&s;es; few pur&s;ue their callings, with any degree of zeal or activity.</P>
<P>Architecture is by no means in a good ta&s;te at Naples. Of three hundred churches and upwards, there is not one, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> with a front or portico, which has any merit; many of them pre&s;ent nothing but a bare wall. They endeavour to make amends by abundance of interior decorations. There is a pro|fu&s;ion of gilding and painting in them, but their pain|ters
<PB N="249" REF="267">
have been corrupted by the national ta&s;te for brilliancy and extravagance.</P>
<P>However, to re&s;cue this fine city from the accu&s;a|tion of a bad ta&s;te in its public ornaments, the king has cau&s;ed the Farne&s;ian bull to be tran&s;ported from Rome, in order to have it placed on the great foun|tain, in the walk of the royal villa. This immen&s;e group con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix figures, larger than life, and many &s;maller ones, together with the rock in which they are repre&s;ented; all &s;aid to be hewn out of one block of marble. It was originally brought from Rhodes to Rome, and placed on Caracalla's baths. It repre&s;ents <HI>Amphion</HI> and <HI>Zetus,</HI> who, by order of <HI>Antione</HI> their mother, are binding <HI>Dirce</HI> to the horns of a wild bull.</P>
<P><HI>I Stadii Publici</HI> are the buildings of the univer&s;ity, made from de&s;igns of <HI>Fontana.</HI> The front is adorned with antique &s;tatues, found at Crema. Profe&s;&s;ors read lectures here on all the &s;ciences.</P>
<P>There are, in this city, three con&s;ervatories, for the education of boys in the profe&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ic. The&s;e furni&s;h a band for the church of the Franci&s;cans, morning and evening, during eight days in Oc|tober.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="268">The mona&s;teries of this city are exceedingly rich. There are not le&s;s than one hundred and &s;eventy-eight of them including tho&s;e ho&s;pitals that are under the directions of the monks; and, as the monks are the hereditary coun&s;el of the populace, it is evident they do not want for coun&s;ellors. The monks, who con|ver&s;e with the nobility and the citizens, are very &s;tu|dious and artful, in &s;centing inheritances; and leave no &s;tone unturned, to procure for their hou&s;es, either pre&s;ents, or partial legacies, when they cannot gra&s;p the whole To the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e practices, are owing tho&s;e amazing riches, which are di&s;played in the decoration of their churches, in the brilliant and very co&s;tly &s;pectacles frequently given there, and in the enormous quantity of plate, with which their &s;ocieties are crowded. The churches of Naples are, perhaps, as rich in this kind, as all the churches of Italy put together.</P>
<P>But, though they covet riches, they are, never|thele&s;s, charitable; there being no poor-rates in Ro|man Catholic countries, as in England, the poor de|pend upon the benevolence of the people; and there are numbers of families every where, that di&s;tribute their donations to the nece&s;&s;itous, at certain appointed times, &s;ome, once a week; &s;ome, oftener. The con|vents generally feed the poor on certain days, who flock to the convents for what they have to di&s;po&s;e

<P>I will clo&s;e this account of Naples, with a declara|tion of Mr. <HI>Sherlock.</HI> Though it has many di&s;agree|able circum&s;tances attending it, &s;o that a man who could live out of it, would not like to be an inhabi|tant of the place; yet, there are a variety of things that will attract a traveller, to view it, perhaps, in pre|ference to mo&s;t other cities of Europe; but, chiefly, an account of the delightful &s;cenes around it. It is not &s;urprizing, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> that <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld make &s;uch fine ver&s;es at Naples; the air is &s;o &s;oft and &s;o pure, the &s;un &s;o brilliant and &s;o warm, and the face of nature &s;o rich and diver&s;ified; that the imagination feels a vivacity and vigour, which it &s;carce ever per|ceives in other countries.</P>

<P>On the right, the hill of Pau&s;ilippo, who&s;e form is &s;emicircular, and adorned to its &s;ummit with trees and plea&s;ure hou&s;es; from its point, which lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ea, this mountain increa&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly, till it ar|rives behind the centre of Naples; and, on its &s;ummit is &s;een a va&s;t tower, overlooking the city and crown|ing the &s;cene. On the left, a chain of va&s;t high mountains, &s;urrounding the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the gulph, or bay of Naples; and who&s;e rugged boldne&s;s, forms a mo&s;t happy contra&s;t with the elegant and cultivated beauties of Pau&s;ilippo. <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> and <HI>Corneille,</HI> would have looked to the left. <HI>Racine</HI> and <HI>Pope,</HI> to the right.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e mountains on the left, Ve&s;uvius is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting by its form, which is a very beautiful cone; by its height, and above all, by its vicinity to the city.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the People, Character, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE people, both of city and country, are vigo|rous, robu&s;t, raw-boned, full of fire and &s;pright|line&s;s; active, indefatigably laborious, and, in a word, cut out for war; they are not any thing like the Ita|lians of Upper Italy. They pride them&s;elves in being de&s;cended from the Greeks, and re&s;embling them. They are broad and full-che&s;ted, with a &s;hort thick neck; fle&s;hy, with a fine complexion, and a very bri&s;k eye. They go with the neck and &s;houlders, brea&s;t and arms, almo&s;t naked.

little of tho&s;e di&s;orders, which all the magi&s;trates' vi|gilance at Paris and London, can &s;carcely prevent. This, as I have ob&s;erved, mu&s;t ari&s;e chiefly from their &s;obriety, and pa&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The women and children do not look &s;o healthy here, as in other parts of Italy. A great number of women are ob&s;erved, to have wens in their throats, as bad as in &s;ome other countries; owing to their drinking, in &s;ummer, &s;o great a quantity of &s;now-water.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of the ordinary women, which ladies likewi&s;e adopt, if they venture abroad on foot, and wi&s;h not to be known, are two black, &s;ilk petti|coats, which &s;erve entirely to conceal their whole figures; as, when both are tied round the wai&s;t, one is &s;uddenly turned up; and, as they pull it quick over their heads, a loo&s;e trimming of narrow, black gauze, drops over the face; whil&s;t a hook and eye fa&s;tens all clo&s;e under the chin, and gives them an air not un|like our country wenches, who throw the gown tail over their heads, to protect them from a &s;ummer &s;hower. The holliday dre&s;&s;es of the pea&s;ants, round Naples, are very rich and cumber&s;ome. We often &s;ee, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> a great, coar&s;e, raw-bone fellow, panting for heat under a thick blue velvet coat, co|mical enough; the females in a &s;carlet cloth petticoat, with a broad gold-lace at the bottom; a jacket open

before, but charged with heavy ornaments, and the head&punc; not unbecomingly, dre&s;&s;ed with an embroidered hankerchief from Turkey.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, the young countrywomen are, in general, far from hand&s;ome, though they have fine eyes and hand&s;ome features; their hands and feet are clum&s;y, their &s;hapes neglected, their necks not firm, and their &s;kins di&s;coloured, by living &s;o much in the &s;un, without bonnets. Among&s;t them, we may find almo&s;t every mode of hair-dre&s;&s;ing, &s;een in the Greek and Roman coins. The <HI>coiffeure</HI> of the younger <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> with the coil of plaited hair upon the crown of the head, occurs, frequently, in the old town; that with the coil lower down, which may be properly &s;tiled <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s head-dre&s;s, is common among the younger part of the &s;ex, in the &s;uburbs of Chiaia, and <HI>Plotinas,</HI> among the women more advanced in years. Very little &s;uffices to cloath the lazaroni, except on holi|days; and then he is, indeed, tawdrily decked out with a laced jacket, and flame-coloured &s;tockings; his buckles are of an enormous magnitude; and &s;eem to be the prototype of tho&s;e with which our pre&s;ent men of mode load their in&s;teps. The women are al&s;o very &s;plendid on &s;uch days of &s;how; but their hair is then bound up in ti&s;&s;ue caps, and &s;carlet nets. Ci|tizens and lawyers are plain enough in their apparel; but, the female part of their family vies with the fir&s;t
<PB N="257" REF="278">
court ladies, in expen&s;ive dre&s;s, and all the vanities of modi&s;h fopperies. Luxury hath, of late, advanced with gigantic &s;trides at Naples. Forty years ago, the Neapolitan ladies wore nets and ribbands on their heads, as the Spani&s;h women do at this day, and not twenty of them were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a cap: but hair, plainly dre&s;&s;ed, is a mode now confined to the lowe&s;t order of people; and all the di&s;tinction of dre&s;s, between the wife of a nobleman, and that of a citi|zen, is entirely laid a&s;ide. Expence and extrava|gance are here in the extreme; the great families, adds <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are oppre&s;&s;ed with a load of debt; the working part of the community always &s;pend the price of their labour before they receive it; and the citizen is reduced to great par&s;imony, almo&s;t to pe|nury, in hou&s;ekeeping; in order to an&s;wer the&s;e de|mands of external &s;how. Short commons, at home; whet his appetite, when invited out to dinner; and it is &s;carce credible what a quantity of victuals he will devour. The nobility, in general, are well &s;erved, and live comfortably, but it is not their cu&s;|tom to invite &s;trangers; the number of poor depen|dents that dine with them, and cannot properly be introduced into company, prevents the great families from inviting foreigners: another rea&s;on may be, their &s;leeping after dinner in &s;o regular a manner, as to undre&s;s and go to bed. No ladies, or gentlemen, fini&s;h their toilets till the afternoon; on which account
<PB N="258" REF="279">
they dine at twelve or one o'clock. The great of|ficers of &s;tate, and mini&s;ters, live in a different &s;tyle, and keep &s;umptuous tables; to which &s;trangers and others have frequent invitations.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Neapolitan grandee's hou&s;e|hold, is on a very expen&s;ive plan. The number of &s;er|vants, and equipages, would &s;uffice for a &s;overeign prince; and the wardrobe of their wives is on the &s;ame magnificent &s;cale; yet no lady, of whatever rank or fortune, has more than one hundred ducats a month, for pin-money. At the birth of every child, the hu&s;|band makes his wife a pre&s;ent of one hundred ounces of &s;ilver, and &s;ome valuable trinkets, according to his fortune.</P>
<P>The king takes very little &s;tate upon him; he lives among his &s;ubjects, with the old Roman idea, of a window in his heart; he rides and rows, and hunts the wild boar, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> and catches fi&s;h in the bay; and &s;ells it too, at market, as dear as he can; but gives away the money directly, &s;o that he is very much beloved. The people know the wor&s;t of him, that is, he &s;hoots at the birds, dances with the girls, eats macaroni, and rows again&s;t the watermen in the bay. One of them, when this lady was there, by his un|courtly effort, &s;he adds, to out-row the king, &s;trained him&s;elf, and bled much at the no&s;e; this accident made
<PB N="259" REF="280">
the king conqueror, and he won the trifling wager that was laid between them; laughed, and leaped on &s;hore, amid the acclamations of the populace, who huzza'd him home to his palace; from whence he &s;ent double the &s;um he won to the waterman's wife, with other tokens of kindne&s;s. For, whil&s;t he re&s;olves to be happy him&s;elf, he is equally determined to make no man wretched. When the Emperor and the Grand Duke, his brothers in law, talked to him of their new projects, for reformation in the church, he told them, that he &s;aw but little advantage they brought into <HI>their</HI> &s;tates, by the&s;e new fangled notions; that when he was at Milan and Florence, the deuce a Neapolitan could be found in either, whil&s;t his capital was crouded with refugees from them; that, in &s;hort, they might do <HI>their</HI> way, but he would do <HI>his;</HI> that he had not now an enemy in the world, public or private; and that he would not make him&s;elf any, for the &s;ake of propa|gating doctrines he did not under&s;tand, and could not take the trouble to &s;tudy; that he &s;hould &s;ay his prayers as he u&s;ed to do, and had no doubt of their being heard, whil&s;t he only begged ble&s;&s;ings on his be|loved people; &s;o, if the&s;e wi&s;e brothers-in-law would &s;ee him enjoy life, in&s;tead of &s;hortening it, by unne|ce&s;&s;ary cares, they might come and &s;ee him the next morning, play a match at tennis.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="281">The truth is, the jolly Neapolitans lead a coar&s;e life, but an unoppre&s;&s;ed one. Marks of abundance are &s;een in all parts of the town. There is no &s;ettled market in any place; but every third &s;hop, almo&s;t, is full of what the French call &s;o properly, <HI>ammunition de bouche;</HI> whil&s;t whole boars, kids, and &s;mall calves, dangle from a &s;ort of neat &s;caffolding, all with their &s;kins on, and make a pretty appearance. Poulterers hang up their birds in the feathers too; not lay them on boards plucked, as they do at Venice and London. The principal &s;treets, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are lined with &s;ellers of macaroni, fried and boiled fi&s;h, puddings, cakes, and vegetables of all &s;orts; where, for a very &s;mall &s;um, which the lazaroni earn, by running of an errand, or picking of pockets, he may find a ready meal, at all hours. The flaggon, hanging out at every convent, invites him to quench his thir&s;t with wine; or if he prefers water, as mo&s;t of the poor do, there are &s;talls in all the thoroughfares, where lemonade and iced water is &s;old. The pa&s;&s;ion for iced water is &s;o great, and &s;o general at Naples, that none but mere beggars will drink it in its natural &s;tate; and a &s;car|city of bread would not be more &s;everely felt, than a &s;carcity of &s;now. It is brought in boats every morn|ing, from the mountains behind Ca&s;telamare, and is farmed out at a great rent by the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="282">In the Chri&s;tmas &s;ea&s;on, the Italians are peculiarly ingenious in decorating their &s;hops, and &s;etting out their wares. Every grocer, fruiterer, &amp;c. mingles orange, lemon, and myrtle leaves among the goods expo&s;ed at his door, as we do ever-greens in our churches; but with infinitely more ta&s;te. Some odd pretty moveable coffee-hou&s;es too, or lemonade-&s;hops, &s;et on wheels, adorned with gilding, painting, &amp;c. and covered with ices, orgeats, and other refre&s;hments; as it were in emulation, each of the other, and in a &s;trange variety of &s;hapes and forms, help towards the finery of Naples. I have counted thirty, adds Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> of the&s;e <HI>galante</HI> &s;hops, on each &s;ide of the &s;treet; which, with their nece&s;&s;ary illuminations, make a brilliant figure by candle-light, till twelve at night; when all the &s;how cea&s;es, and every one puts out his candle and goes to bed. Till that hour, how|ever, few things can exceed the merriment of Naples; while <HI>volantes,</HI> or running-footmen, dre&s;&s;ed like tum|blers before a &s;how, precede all carriages of di&s;tinc|tion, and endeavour to keep the people from being run over; yet, whil&s;t they are li&s;tening to &s;ome &s;treet orator, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently de&s;cribed, they often get cru&s;hed and killed: yet as Pope &s;ays,</P>

<P>In Naples, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> they are accu&s;tomed to &s;treet orators; the&s;e are men who, &s;pouter-like, will repeat &s;tanzas from <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> or any other poet, in a pom|pous, recitative cadence, peculiar to the natives of Italy, and who hold the book in their hands, in ca&s;e their me|mory &s;hould fail them. They occa&s;ionally comment on the pa&s;&s;ages they recite, in pro&s;e; in order to bring the poet's expre&s;&s;ion nearer to the capacities of their

hearers. The Doctor tells us, he li&s;tened to one &s;ome time, and that his auditory increa&s;ed every mo|ment; men, women, and children, bringing &s;eats from the neighbouring hou&s;es, to &s;it down round him. His cloak hung loo&s;e from one &s;houlder, his right-arm being di&s;engaged for the purpo&s;es of oratory. Sometimes he winds it with a &s;low, &s;mooth motion, according with the cadence of the ver&s;es; &s;ometimes he pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart, to give energy to the pathos of the poet. Now he gathered the hanging folds of the right &s;ide of his cloak, and held them gracefully up, in imitation of a Roman &s;enator; and anon he &s;wung them acro&s;s his left &s;houlder, like a citizen of Naples; he humoured the &s;tanza by his voice, which he could modulate to the key of any pa&s;&s;ion; from the boi&s;terous bur&s;ts of rage, to the tender notes of pity and of love. But, when he came to de&s;cribe the exploits of <HI>Orlando,</HI> from <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> he tru&s;ted neither to the power of his own voice, nor the poet's genius; but, throwing off his cloak, and gra&s;ping his cane, he a&s;&s;umed the warlike attitude, and &s;tern countenance of that hero; repre&s;enting, by the mo&s;t animated ac|tions, how he drove his &s;pear through the bodies of &s;ix of her enemies at once; the point, at the &s;ame time, killing a &s;eventh, who would al&s;o have remained transfixed with his companions, if the &s;pear could have held more than &s;ix men of an ordinary &s;ize upon it, at a time.</P>

<P>At Rome, the&s;e &s;treet-orators entertain their au|dience with entertaining pa&s;&s;ages from hi&s;tory; that whil&s;t it amu&s;es the populace, and keeps them from le&s;s innocent and more expen&s;ive pa&s;times, it gives them &s;ome general idea of hi&s;tory.

This water, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> &s;till continues to be privately made at Naples, under the appellation of <HI>Acquetta di Napoli;</HI> and not many years &s;ince, a &s;mall ca&s;k of it was, according to orders, &s;ent to a certain country; but &s;ince, lemon-juice has been found an antidote again&s;t it; this vile compo&s;ition has fallen into &s;ome di&s;repute.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="292">It mu&s;t be in con&s;equence of the precariou&s;ne&s;s of puni&s;hment, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> that this city furni&s;hes many more delinquents, in proportion to its &s;ize, than our wicked London. There are in the pri&s;ons, at Naples, generally between two and three thou&s;and; &s;ome &s;ay more; be&s;ides about two thou&s;and in the galleys, lying in the harbour. Even murderers, &s;ometimes, e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. It is &s;carce credible, but a magi&s;trate of this city declared to a gentleman, who was a&s;king &s;ome que&s;tions on the &s;ubject, that, the preceding week, the populace had been very orderly, for that only four murders had been committed. This, adds <HI>Sharp,</HI> I had from a noble Neapolitan, who atte&s;ted it as a fact; perhaps it might be exaggerated; but they cer|tainly do not hold murder in &s;o horrid a light here, as in colder climates. A young gentleman informed me, that on the road to this place, from Rome, he &s;aw at a di&s;tance a &s;cuffle among &s;ome po&s;tillions, in which, as it turned out afterwards, one of them was &s;tabbed dead. On enquiry into the matter, he was cooly an|&s;wered, that it was only a <HI>colpo di coltello,</HI> (a &s;tab with a knife.)</P>
<P>The indifference with which the crime of mur|der is regarded, among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the Italians, is further illu&s;trated by the following anec|dote. A gentleman of Naples, in pa&s;&s;ing occa|&s;ionally before the king's palace, had frequently no|ticed
<PB N="272" REF="293">
a man of &s;ingular appearance at work. He was chained to &s;ome others, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in removing rub|bi&s;h, and bringing &s;tones for a new building, the foundation of which had ju&s;t been laid. The man, by having often &s;een him pa&s;s, recollected his per&s;on, and always took off his hat, as he found an oppor|tunity. The gentleman, not knowing how to account for his attention, was induced, one day, to inquire the cau&s;e of his civility and of his chains. To the fir&s;t part of the query he an&s;wered, in the Neapolitan &s;tyle, that it was "<HI>il &s;uo devere,</HI> his duty;" and to the &s;econd he &s;aid, that he was in that predicament for <HI>una minchionerioe,</HI> a trifle." <HI>"Ho ammazzata &s;olamente una donna,"</HI> &s;aid he, "I have only killed a woman."</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> have, in all ages been remarkable for a voluptuous manner of living. The luxury of Capua and Atella is well known, and Naples is by <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;tiled,</P>

part of it is a receptacle for two thou&s;and; and yet it is no uncommon thing for eccle&s;ia&s;tics to lodge in the&s;e infamous parts of the town. This totally cor|rupts all the youth; and the clergy, being exempt from the civil juri&s;diction, and connived at by their &s;upe|riors, that the &s;acred order may not be di&s;graced by puni&s;hments, &s;et the wor&s;t of examples.</P>
<P>They tell us, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> that the very air of Italy contributes to its profligacy. <HI>Propertius</HI> intreats his <HI>Cynthia</HI> not to remain too long on &s;hore, which he &s;eems to think dangerous to the cha&s;te&s;t maiden.</P>

Though there are not wanting tho&s;e who affirm, that the influence of this &s;educing climate, is evident <HI>now,</HI> in as &s;trong a degree, as it is de&s;cribed to have been anciently; that it pervades people of all ranks and conditions, and that in the convents them&s;elves:</P>

<P>For my own part, continues this author, I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that I &s;aw nothing whil&s;t I was there, to ju&s;tify the general imputation above-mentioned. There are per&s;ons who contend, that the Neapolitans are of a colder con&s;titution&punc; and more philo&s;ophic in the command of their pa&s;&s;ions, than any people in Europe. Do not the lower cla&s;s of men, &s;ay they, &s;trip them&s;elves before the hou&s;es, which front the bay, and bathe in the &s;ea, without the lea&s;t cere|mony? Are not numbers of the&s;e athletic figures, during the heat of the day, &s;een walking and &s;porting on the &s;hore perfectly naked, and with no more idea of &s;hame, than <HI>Adam,</HI> felt in his &s;tate of innocence; whil&s;t the ladies from their coaches, and the &s;ervant maids and young girls, who pa&s;s along, contemplate
<PB N="275" REF="296">
this &s;ingular &s;pectacle, with as little apparent emo|tion, as the ladies in Hyde-park, behold a review of the hor&s;e-guards?</P>
<P><HI>Gro&s;ley</HI> &s;ays, princes are as common at Naples, as marqui&s;&s;es at Paris. The luxury of the nobi|lity lies chiefly in their equipages. Their mules, or hor&s;es, are the fine&s;t that can be got; the length of the traces is one chief mark of grandeur and di&s;|tinction; and their lacqueys are very hand&s;ome well-made fellows, in rich liveries, trailing &s;words of an enormous length; whereas the ma&s;ter's &s;word, which is more like a poniard, is carried by the fir&s;t lackey at a button-hole.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants in this country, according to <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> are &s;o flothful, as to prefer begging, or robbing, to la|bour and indu&s;try; but, in the city of Naples, there is &s;omething of an indu&s;trious &s;pirit, and &s;everal flouri&s;hing manufactures are there carried on. It is a phra&s;e here, that a king, to keep the people quiet, mu&s;t provide three <HI>F</HI>'s; namely, <HI>Fe&s;te, Farine,</HI> and <HI>Forche;</HI> that is, "Fe&s;tivity, Flour, and Gibbets," the people being exce&s;&s;ively fond of public diver&s;ions; clamorous on the dearth of corn; and &s;editious, unle&s;s kept in awe by &s;everity.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="297">The fi&s;hermen of St. Lucia, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are the hand&s;ome&s;t men in Naples. They have the true old Grecian features, and &s;uch well-proportioned limbs, as might &s;erve for models in any academy of de&s;ign. Indeed, the whole race of men in this city, according to <HI>Sharp,</HI> are more robu&s;t and athletic, than the run of mankind in London, and carry larger burdens.</P>
<P>Wives are in &s;uch &s;ubordination to their hu&s;bands, that, though the lower cla&s;s, particularly fi&s;hermen's wives, is always fighting and &s;colding, they never re|&s;i&s;t their hu&s;band's authority; but, when he comes, to &s;eparate the combatants, and carry home his di&s;he|velled &s;pou&s;e, &s;he goes off quietly with him; and &s;eems to &s;tand as much in awe of her con&s;ort, as the Ru&s;&s;ian wives do of theirs, and &s;uffers her&s;elf to be beaten by him with as little murmuring. I was once, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> &s;hewn a woman here, who, during the life of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, was a pattern of mode&s;ty, and evenne&s;s of temper to the whole pari&s;h; but, in con|tracting a &s;econd marriage, &s;urprized and &s;candalized the neighbourhood with her perpetual riots, and boi&s;|terous behaviour. On being reprimanded by the cu|rate, &s;he ever frankly acknowledged, that her former hu&s;band under&s;tood the management of a wife, and u&s;ed to check her intemperate bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, by timely correction; but that her pre&s;ent helpmate was too mild to apply the proper cha&s;ti&s;ement, which
<PB N="277" REF="298">
every wife requires more or le&s;s. Men &s;eldom inter|fere in feminine brawls; when they do, they gene|rally content them&s;elves with abu&s;ing, threatening, or &s;haking a cudgel, or pitchfork at their antagoni&s;t, till the crowd comes in to part them. Sometimes a man is &s;tabbed, but this is rare among the fi&s;hermen. Manners vary with the di&s;tricts; in &s;ome they en|gage with bludgeons. The&s;e are the true lazaroni of <HI>Ma&s;&s;aniello;</HI> in others, the attack is made with knives, and other deadly weapons; but the Neapo|litans are by no means &s;o blood-thir&s;ty and revenge|ful, as repre&s;ented. It requires more than a &s;light provocation to lead them to extremities. Drunken|ne&s;s is not a common vice at Naples, of cour&s;e, quar|rels are rare. It is al&s;o uncommon to &s;ee any thing, in public, like gallantry, among the people; no &s;ol|diers, or &s;ailors, leading their doxies; or girls going about in que&s;t of lovers; all which, in other coun|tries, give ri&s;e to riot and blood&s;hed. Though at Naples, there is only a nominal police, yet hou&s;e-breaking is unknown, riots &s;till more &s;o; it bears no proportion to the murders committed in the di&s;tant provinces, where I am credibly informed, &s;ays <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> no le&s;s than four thou&s;and per&s;ons are killed annually. Mo&s;t of the&s;e crimes are perpetrated with guns, in the mountainous countries, where a great fe|rocity of character and wildne&s;s of manners pre|vail.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="299">Cici&s;beos are as general here, as in other parts of Italy. Many people in England imagine, the majo|rity of Cici&s;beos, to be an innocent kind of dangling fribble, but they are utterly mi&s;taken; nor do I find that it is under&s;tood here, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> that the ladies live in greater purity with their Cici&s;beos, than with their hu&s;bands; and generally &s;peaking, with much le&s;s. If only one-half of the ladies practi&s;ed this cu&s;tom, the other half would de&s;pi&s;e them; but, in fact, very few have any pretence to upbraid the re&s;t with bad conduct. To &s;ay the truth, if you invite five ladies to dinner, you mu&s;t lay ten plates; as each, for a cer|tainty, brings her Cici&s;beo with her.</P>
<P>How is it probable, that hu&s;bands and wives &s;hould have any love for each other, when they are always brought together, without the lea&s;t participation of their own; nothing being con&s;ulted by parents, but for|tune and family.</P>
<P>Children here, have very little tendency to &s;upport the friend&s;hip and harmony of the married &s;tate. A certain knowledge of every wife's attachment to a lover extingui&s;hes all &s;ocial affection, and all fondne&s;s for the offspring; and it is only the elde&s;t born who, the hu&s;band is &s;ure belongs to him; and for that &s;e|curity, it is generally requi&s;ite the birth &s;hould take

place the fir&s;t year, as the women &s;eldom hold out longer without a Cice&s;beo.</P>
<P>The Calabre&s;e have &s;ome very capricious notions. One is, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> that every child, who&s;e mother has been true to her marriage vow, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;emble the father. It is thought a reproach, to have been fuckled by any one but one's own mother.</P>
<P>They repo&s;e great confidence in judgments, and expect to &s;ee every one who jeers at the defect of another, afflicted with the &s;ame. Inoculation has been attempted at one place near Reggio; but from ill &s;ucce&s;s and &s;uper&s;titious aver&s;ion, tho&s;e who have un|dergone the operation, are marked by &s;ome oppro|brious nickname.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on dies in the fields, it is believed his &s;pirit will appear in the &s;ame place, in white robes; and that the only way of laying it is, to &s;end out young boys to approach &s;ilently, and to cover it with a volley of &s;tones. Not long &s;ince, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> a Dominican prie&s;t, &s;itting in his white garment, on a hill near Tropea, taking a &s;ketch of the country; was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;pirit of an old mad woman, who had drop|ped down dead &s;ome time before, on that very &s;pot; and was near being killed by the youths of the neigh|bouring
<PB N="280" REF="301">
village, before he could convince them of the little conceits of their error.</P>
<P>The funeral behaviour, and mea&s;ure of grief of the Calabre&s;e, are regulated by the &s;tricte&s;t etiquette. The virtues, as well as vices, of a decea&s;ed father of a family, are recapitulated by the olde&s;t man in company. The widow repeats his words, adds com|ments of her own, then roars out loudly, and plucks off handfuls of her hair, which &s;he &s;trews over the bier. Daughters tear their locks, and beat their brea&s;ts, but remain &s;ilent. More di&s;tant relations re|peat the oration cooly, and commit no outrage upon their per&s;ons. When the kin&s;man of a baron, or a rich citizen dies, a number of old women are hired to perform all the&s;e ceremonies, and howl for the fa|mily.</P>
<P>At Naples, the forms are rather different. I was one day, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> pre&s;ent at the funeral of an old fi&s;herman. The actions of his widow were &s;o over&s;trained, as to be truly ridiculous; &s;he tore off her hair and clothes, and yelled in the mo&s;t hideous manner, till her &s;tep-&s;ons appeared to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods. She then turned, her fury upon them, and beat them out of the hou&s;e. The prie&s;ts now came for the body, and &s;he oppo&s;ed their entry for a decent length of time; but, at la&s;t, &s;uffering her&s;elf
<PB N="281" REF="302">
to be overpowered, flew to the window with her daughters and her mother (who, from having outlived many relations, had &s;carcely a hair left on her head) and there beat her brea&s;t, &s;cratched her cheeks, and threw whole handfuls of hair towards the bier, with the frantick ge&s;tures of a demoniack. The proce&s;&s;ion was no &s;ooner out of &s;ight, than all was quiet; and in five minutes I heard them laughing and dancing about the room, as if rejoicing to be rid of the old churl.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the country, it is a rule to fa&s;t the whole day of interment. Two women, in a village near Salerno, mother and daughter of a farmer, at who&s;e removal from the hou&s;e, they had acted their parts with great applau&s;e, locked them&s;elves up; and, in order to gather &s;trength, after the fatigue they had undergone; began, in defiance of cu&s;tom, to fry &s;ome pieces of tripe for their dinner. As ill luck would have it, a couple of relations, who living at a great di&s;tance, had come too late for the ceremony, knocked at the door, to pay their re&s;pects to the di&s;con&s;olate widow. Great was the difficulty they found in gain|ing admittance: all the parade of grief was again di&s;|played, the dinner &s;lipped into a napkin, and hid under the bed, and nothing heard in the room but groans and lamentations. The &s;trangers entered with compo&s;ed mien, and were endeavouring, with little &s;ucce&s;s, to admini&s;ter comfort to their unhappy kin&s;|women;
<PB N="282" REF="303">
when behold! a dog they had brought with them, winded the fry, and dragged it out into the middle of the floor, to the great anger of the vi&s;itors, and utter confu&s;ion of the mourners, who&s;e reputation was irretrievably ruined in the e&s;teem of the whole pari&s;h.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Environs, Ea&s;t of Naples.</HEAD>
<P>THE environs of Naples are highly entertaining to the cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, the antiquary, and the naturali&s;t. To the We&s;t are Puzzuoli, and Baiae; to the Ea&s;t, Ve&s;uvius, the &s;ubterranean cities, and the mu&s;eum at Portici.</P>
<P>The commencement of the road, from Naples to Puzzuoli, lies through the <HI>grotta di Pau&s;ilippe,</HI> which opens into one of the &s;uburbs. Formerly, it was nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s Mount Pau&s;ilippo, which, from its delightful appearance, is &s;aid to have derived its Greek name, implying <HI>grief appea&s;ing;</HI> but, at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="283" REF="304">
that labour is unnece&s;&s;ary; a broad &s;ubterraneous road being cut through the mountain. This pa&s;&s;age is conducted, chiefly, through large rocks, and &s;ome|times through <HI>&s;trata</HI> of &s;and. It is at both ends, between ninety and an hundred feet high, in order to throw in more light. Towards the middle, where the top is lower, two large vent-holes, for light and air, are made through the roof of this grotto; but the light is not &s;ufficient; and travellers are, be&s;ides, ex|tremely incommoded with the du&s;t, in this &s;ubter|raneous pa&s;&s;age. The bottom of it, which in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> V. was paved with broad &s;tones, like the &s;treets of Naples, is cleaned &s;everal times in a year; and then it is pretty free from du&s;t; but, as it is a road extremely frequented, this convenience is of no long duration. The breadth is between eighteen and twenty feet, &s;o that there is &s;ufficient room for two carriages to avoid each other, and, to prevent any inconvenience on this head; it is u&s;ual, in the dark places, to call out to any per&s;on coming the contrary Way, to know on which &s;ide they intend to keep. When they an&s;wer <HI>alla montagna,</HI> "to the mountain," it &s;ignifies the Naples &s;ide; which, to tho&s;e coming from the city, is on the right-hand; and <HI>alla marina,</HI> "to the &s;ea," denotes the left-hand &s;ide. We have often drove through this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> but never without flambeaux.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="305">Its length is &s;omething more than half an Italian mile. On the left-hand, near the middle, is an ora|tory hewn out of the rock, with a lamp continually burning in it. The grotto is, by the vulgar, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made by magic, and that <HI>Virgil</HI> was the &s;orcerer who wrought it. The poet, it is true, gives a de&s;cription of the Cumaean grotto, but this the learned populace apply to the grotto of Pau&s;ilippo; and conclude, &s;ince he has &s;o circum&s;tantially de|&s;cribed an ancient &s;ybil, or prophete&s;s, that he mu&s;t have been a wizard. If a man, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> would form to him&s;elf a ju&s;t idea of this place, he mu&s;t fancy a va&s;t rock, undermined from one end to the other, and a highway running through it, near as long and as broad as the Mall in St. James's park.</P>
<P>Opinions vary concerning the fir&s;t openers of this grotto. This kind of rocky &s;ub&s;tance is perforated with &s;o much ea&s;e, and the cu&s;tom of carrying on &s;ub|terraneous galleries, &s;eems to have prevailed at &s;o very early a period of &s;ociety, that &s;ome authors have a&s;cribed the work to the giants, or the Cimmerians, who were wont to make caves, their places of re&s;i|dence, as well as the repo&s;itory of their plunder. Others a&s;&s;ert it to have been done by <HI>Cocceius,</HI> an ar|chitect, of the Augu&s;tan age. From <HI>Seneca</HI>'s expre&s;|&s;ions, complaining of its inconveniences, we gather, that it was then open only for foot pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="306">Po&s;&s;ibly, the cutting of a road through the moun|tain, was at fir&s;t not thought of, but the great quan|tity of &s;tones fetched out of it, for the buildings in Naples, and Puzzuoli, might occa&s;ion &s;uch a deep excavation on both &s;ides; that, at la&s;t, for the con|venience of travelling, government employed work|men to pull down, and clear away the intermediate &s;pace: be&s;ides, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed the way was at fir&s;t in &s;uch a good condition, as it is at pre&s;ent. <HI>Seneca,</HI> in his fifty-&s;eventh letter &s;ays, <HI>Nihil illo carcere longius, nihil illis faucibus ob&s;curius; i. e.</HI> "This dun|geon is intolerably long and extremely dark." From whence it may be inferred, that the apertures, which in <HI>Strabo</HI>'s time, through which light entered at the &s;ides, were &s;oon after &s;topped up, either by earth|quakes, or want of proper care.</P>
<P>Neapolitan hi&s;torians agree, that king <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> of the Arragon family, cau&s;ed this pa&s;&s;age to be con|&s;iderably widened; and Don <HI>Pedro de Toledo,</HI> vice|roy, under the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. is known to have given orders for levelling and paving the ground, as likewi&s;e for enlarging the two vent-holes, which had been bored through by order of <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> I. That it was entirely wrought by art, is unque&s;tionable, from the marks it bears of chizels, and other tools u&s;ed by &s;tone-cutters. The earthquakes that have made &s;uch havock, among the numerous remains of antiquity in
<PB N="286" REF="307">
the&s;e parts, have hitherto &s;pared this u&s;eful work. Its &s;afety is, probably, due to the &s;olidity of the rock, in which there does not appear any veins, or mixture of &s;ulphur, or any kind of inflammable particles. Under this mountain is a large quarry, from which they dig &s;tone, that is frequently u&s;ed in the buildings at Naples. On the &s;ide of the mountain next the &s;ea, and among&s;t the rocks, grows the plant <HI>Opuntia,</HI> or Indian fig, on which is found the cochineal. Upon the top of this grotto, are &s;till &s;ome remains of an antique aqueduct, which conveyed water from Serino, to &s;upply a re|&s;ervoir called <HI>Pi&s;cina mirabile,</HI> of which we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>The du&s;t in this grotto, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> is intolera|ble in &s;ummer, and the &s;cantine&s;s of light at all &s;ea|&s;ons of the year, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; for, that which is ad|mitted through the apertures abovementioned, is no &s;ecurity again&s;t the danger of being run over, cru&s;hed again&s;t the wall, or at lea&s;t hurt by the faggots which a&s;&s;es are continually bringing from the woods. I never could accu&s;tom my&s;elf, &s;ays the above author, per|fectly to this &s;ubterraneous road, but with ha&s;ty &s;teps &s;ought to leave it as the &s;eat of noi&s;e, gloom, du&s;t, and unwhole&s;ome damps; wondering, at the &s;ame time, how pa&s;&s;engers ventured into &s;uch a place at all hours, &s;ingly, or in company, without any guard to prevent a&s;&s;aults, or &s;ufficient light to detect a lurking

Were a &s;imilar thoroughfare nece&s;&s;ary, near any other capital, it would require all the exertion of the magi&s;tracy, to pre&s;erve the lives and properties of the inhabitants, who had occa&s;ion to pa&s;s through it; near London, none but a madman would venture into it. It is certainly no &s;mall matter of &s;urprize, to find this pa&s;&s;age &s;o &s;ecure, in a country &s;o ill pro|vided with officers of police; it reflects honour upon the national character, and, indeed, it behoves me to give te&s;timony in its favour; as I never, &s;ays <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> met with any in&s;ult, nor &s;aw rea&s;on to expect one, during my long abode among the Neapolitans, or my innumerable and pervious rides and walks, through different parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Above the Ea&s;tern entrance of this celebrated <HI>grotta,</HI> on the brink of a precipice, in a vineyard be|longing to the Marquis <HI>Salcitro,</HI> are to be &s;een the ruins of an ancient mau&s;oleum. It was originally built in the form of a pyramid; but the lower part of it, which is all that is now remaining, is not much un|like a large oven. The way to it is not to be found without a guide; and, on the &s;ide towards Pau&s;ilippo, it is &s;o narrow, and runs along &s;uch a high precipice, that it is &s;omewhat dangerous to per&s;ons &s;ubject to giddine&s;s. This ancient ruin, generally pa&s;&s;es for the monument of the poet <HI>Virgil;</HI> but without &s;ufficient grounds, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> to warrant &s;uch conjecture. In

the wall within it, are ten &s;mall niches, or cavities, ap|parently de&s;igned for urns. According to <HI>Alphon&s;o de Hereda,</HI> late bi&s;hop of Ariano, the marble urn in which <HI>Virgil</HI>'s arches had been depo&s;ited, &s;tood here on nine &s;mall, marble pillars, of which, at pre&s;ent, there is not the lea&s;t appearance; and what became of &s;uch a remarkable piece of antiquity, is al&s;o a great my&s;tery. Some pretend, that at the earne&s;t &s;o|licitations of the inhabitants of Mantua, they were pre&s;ented to that city; but others affirm, that the Car|dinal of <HI>Mantua,</HI> found means to get them into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The third opinion is, that the urn was tran&s;ported to Genoa, but that the pillars were ap|plied to &s;ome other u&s;e. This is certain, that at Mantua, where they pride them&s;elves not a little, on account of their city being the birth-place of that immortal bard, they know nothing of the place of his burial. <HI>Ste&s;&s;ano,</HI> in his account of the churches of Naples &s;ays, that in his time, which was no longer ago than 1560, both the urn and the pillars were in being, with this di&s;tich, then legible, near them:

<P>Many a &s;olitary walk, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> have I taken to this place. The earth which contains his a&s;hes, we expected to find cloathed in the brighte&s;t verdure.

&s;uch di&s;tance, as renders the hope of ever &s;eeing them again uncertain. No wonder, therefore, that in a con|templative mood, our &s;teps are often directed to a &s;pot &s;o well calculated to create and cheri&s;h &s;entiments con|genial with the &s;tate of our mind. But then comes an antiquarian, with his odious doubts, to di&s;turb the plea&s;ing &s;ource of our enjoyment; and, from the fair and delightful regions of fancy, conveys us in a mo|ment to a dark, barren, and comfortle&s;s de&s;art;&mdash;he <HI>doubts</HI> whether this be the real place where the a&s;hes of <HI>Virgil</HI> were depo&s;ited; and tells us an un&s;atisfac|tory &s;tory about the other &s;ide of the bay; and that he is rather inclined to believe, the poet was buried &s;omewhere there, without determining any particular &s;pot. Would to Heaven, that the&s;e doubters would keep their minds to them&s;elves, and not ruffle the tranquillity of true believers!</P>
<P>But after all, why &s;hould not this be the real tomb of <HI>Virgil?</HI> Why &s;hould the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who delight in pilgrimage to this &s;pot, be deprived of that plea|&s;ure? Why &s;hould the poet's gho&s;t be allowed to wander along the dreary banks of the Styx, till anti|quarians erect a cenotaph to his memory? Even <HI>they</HI> acknowledge he was buried in this bay, and near Naples; and tradition has fixed on this &s;pot, which, exclu&s;ive of every other pre&s;umption, is a much
<PB N="291" REF="312">
&s;tronger evidence in its favour, than their vague con|jectures again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Of the ancient monuments at Naples the mo&s;t en|tire, and unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t curious, is <HI>Virgil</HI>'s tomb, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley.</HI> This monument, which by <HI>Mi&s;&s;on</HI> and <HI>Montfaucon,</HI> is repre&s;ented as a pyramid almo&s;t ruined, is a lanthorn or turret, about twenty feet high, on open arcades; the &s;olid parts of which were formerly adorned with pillars. This &s;tructure &s;tands on a platform, cut in the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the hill of Pau&s;ilippo, in &s;ight of the two bays of Naples; the harbour, the ca&s;tles, part of the city lengthways, and fronting Mount Ve&s;uvius. Unque&s;tionably, it was, in order to make it &s;o con&s;picuous, that its elevation &s;o much exceeds the proportion of its ba&s;e. It com|mands the entrance of the favourite grotto; and, by the excavations daily carrying on in this part of the mountain, commands it &s;o, that at pre&s;ent it is &s;carce two feet from the brink of a precipice, a hundred and eighty feet deep; and, if the&s;e excavations be con|tinued, they mu&s;t certainly undermine this valuable monument.</P>
<P>On the external &s;urface of the cupola, in which it terminates, is a prodigy much celebrated by the Ita|lian poets; I mean its being exactly crowned with a laurel, though the only nouri&s;hment the tree receives
<PB N="292" REF="313">
is, what its roots meet with in the joining of the &s;tones. All travellers are &s;ure to have a pluck at this tree, which they do by means of a rope, with a &s;tone at the end of it. You may be &s;ure, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> in her de&s;cription of this celebrated tomb, "I am po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome of the leaves of this &s;acred tree; how happy &s;hould I be, if drinking a decoction of them, would in&s;pire me with Virgilian poe&s;y! The &s;ide of the mountain where the tomb &s;tands, in&s;tead of any trees of this kind, is covered with yews and firs. <HI>Vir|gil</HI>'s laurel, however, recruits its daily lo&s;&s;es, and perpe|tuates it&s;elf with renovating vigour. In the &s;ixteenth century, there was only one &s;tem which &s;tood in the centre of the cupola, where we will &s;uppo&s;e it to have been planted by &s;ome Neapolitan, a warm admirer of <HI>Virgil.</HI> About the beginning of the la&s;t century, a fir blown by the wind, from a collateral foot of the mountain, fell with its top on the &s;tem thus choaking it; but nature her&s;elf repaired the accident, &s;etting, as layers, the compre&s;&s;ed ramifications of the root, which now have &s;pread over the cupola's whole &s;ur|face.</P>
<P>Beautiful points of view offer them&s;elves every &s;tep in a&s;cending this mountain; the &s;ummit of which is covered with villas and gardens, planted with ever|greens, belonging to &s;everal noble families at Naples. Further on, towards the North, is the convent of the
<PB N="293" REF="314">
<HI>Camaldoli,</HI> from which there is a mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;ea-view, and a mo&s;t beautiful land-one. Hence you may go through fore&s;ts of che&s;nuts, opening &s;ome|times to noble views, till you reach the glacis of the ca&s;tle of St. Elmo; where the whole city and &s;uburbs appear in one collective picture. The Carthu&s;ian convent, adjoining to the ca&s;tle, is, perhaps, the be&s;t &s;ituated mona&s;tery in Europe.</P>
<P>On this mountain, in the Villa Mazza, are the re|mains of <HI>Pollio</HI>'s fi&s;h-ponds, &s;o often mentioned in the works of ancient writers; the expence he was at in embelli&s;hing them, the extravagant pa&s;&s;ion he had for his fi&s;h, which, by care and feeding, grew to a remark|able &s;ize; the cruel food with which he &s;upplied them, and the rebuke he met with from <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> in who&s;e pre&s;ence he bad ordered a &s;lave to be thrown into the pond, for a trivial offence; are circum&s;tances that have rendered the&s;e re&s;ervoirs famous.</P>
<P>Puzzuoli is &s;ituated about &s;even miles from Naples. It had its ancient name, <HI>Puteoli,</HI> either from a &s;ulphu|reous &s;tench, or from the great number of <HI>put&eacute;i,</HI> or holes, which are made here, on account of the &s;ul|phur works, and by digging for &s;and; which in an|cient times was found very &s;erviceable for building, e&s;pecially under water. <HI>Quis enim &s;atis miretur,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Pliny, pe&s;&s;imam ejus terroe partem ideoque pulverem ap|pellatam

It is a&s;&s;erted, by &s;ome authors, that this city was founded five hundred and twenty-two years before the Chri&s;tian Aera, by one <HI>Decius,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and, according to others, by &s;ome one el&s;e. It is mo&s;t agreeably &s;ituated on the margin of a &s;mall bay; and the great quantity of beautiful &s;tones, and gems ca&s;t up by the &s;ea, is a &s;uf|ficient proof of its former &s;plendor and magnificence. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e &s;tones, are of a blue, or a red ca&s;t, with &s;everal pieces of <HI>Verde antico,</HI> por|phyry, &amp;c. and &s;eem to have been u&s;ed in Mo&s;aic work; there are frequently found agate, cornelian, amethy&s;t, ja&s;per, onyx, beryl, <HI>lapis lazuli,</HI> &amp;c. and many of them cameos, and intaglios.</P>
<P>On every hill, and vale of the environs, appear the ruins of exten&s;ive villas, once embelli&s;hed with all the elegancies of combined arts; now traced only by half buried, mouldering walls, and &s;ome marble frag|ments;
<PB N="295" REF="316">
left, as it were, to vouch for the ta&s;te and co&s;t|line&s;s with which they were con&s;tructed. In the la&s;t period of the commonwealth, and during the gaudy aera of the <HI>Coe&s;ars,</HI> almo&s;t every per&s;on, of exalted rank, had a hou&s;e in this country, which the &s;agacious anti|quaries of Puzzuoli point out to you, without doubt or he&s;itation.</P>
<P>The town of Puzzuoli, and its environs, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> pre&s;ents &s;uch a number of objects worthy of the attention of the antiquarian, the natural philo|&s;opher, and the cla&s;&s;ic &s;cholar; that to de&s;cribe all, with the minutene&s;s they de&s;erve, would fill volumes. The cathedral, now under the protection of St. <HI>Ja|nuarius,</HI> and St. <HI>Proculus,</HI> was formerly a temple, de|dicated to <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>It is built of large &s;tones, without cement. No more of the ancient temple remains, than &s;ome Co|rinthian columns, with their capitals, and part of the entablature, of Parian marble, and beautiful work|man&s;hip, in one of the &s;ide-walls of the cathedral.</P>
<P>The temple of <HI>Jupiter Serapis,</HI> in this city, is ac|counted a very intere&s;ting monument of antiquity; being quite different from the Roman and Greek temples, and built in the manner of the A&s;iatics; pro|bably by the Egyptian and A&s;iatic merchants, who
<PB N="296" REF="317">
&s;ettled here; this place having been the great empo|rium of Italy, until the Romans built O&s;tia and An|tium. The ruins of this temple are in the fine&s;t pre|&s;ervation of any round Naples. It was originally encompa&s;&s;ed by forty-two &s;quare rooms, which are now almo&s;t reduced to ruins; yet &s;till &s;ome columns of beautiful white marble are to be &s;een, fluted, and highly fini&s;hed. The whole was paved with large &s;labs of marble, and the edifice completely encru&s;ted with the &s;ame. It is curious to &s;ee the ma&s;&s;y rings fixed in the pavement, to which the victims were fa&s;tened, and the copper pipes, or drains, to convey away their blood: here is a pierced &s;quare of marble, of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, which &s;erved as a drain &s;tone; for it is placed in the center of a quadran|gular part of the temple, preci&s;ely under the open part of the roof, in order to receive and carry off the rain water, which entered at the opening. Half of its buildings are &s;till buried under the earth, thrown upon it by volcanic commotions, or accumulated by the crumblings of the hill.</P>
<P>The enclo&s;ure is &s;quare, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> environed with buildings for prie&s;ts, and baths for votaries: in the center remains a circular platform, with four flights of &s;teps up to it; va&s;es for fire, a centrical altar, rings for victims, and other appendages of &s;acrifice entire and not di&s;placed; &s;ixteen columns of African
<PB N="297" REF="318">
marble, that &s;u&s;tained the roof and the &s;tatues, have been removed to the new palace at Ca&s;erta, the pe|de&s;tals of the &s;tatues only remaining.</P>
<P>In that part of the town, called <HI>la Piazza,</HI> is placed a &s;quare pede&s;tal of white marble, found in the year 1690. Each &s;ide has a bas-relief. Although they are much injured, we may di&s;tingui&s;h fourteen figures, by which are repre&s;ented &s;o many cities of A&s;ia-Minor. The pede&s;tal is in&s;cribed to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and probably a &s;tatue of him had been placed upon it; erected, according to the opinion of &s;ome learned men, by the&s;e fourteen cities that were near being en|tirely demoli&s;hed by an earthquake, in his reign, to whom he had &s;ent very liberal &s;upplies. It is e&s;teemed a mo&s;t beautiful bas-relief, and a work of excellent ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The ruins of its ancient edifices, are widely &s;pread along the adjacent hills and &s;hores. An amphi|theatre &s;till exi&s;ts, entire in mo&s;t of its parts. It is &s;aid to have &s;tood formerly within the walls of the city, but is now near a mile di&s;tant from it. This is a proof of the great decay of the town, from its former extent and &s;plendor. The arena, which is now a garden, is two hundred and fifty feet long; the por|ticos of entrance, which were below the &s;teps, or &s;eats, for the &s;pectators, and the dens for wild bea&s;ts, with a
<PB N="298" REF="319">
&s;tone trough in each, to hold water for them, are &s;till to be &s;een. Here, it is &s;aid, St. <HI>Januarius</HI> and his companions were thrown, to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts; but the latter were, it &s;eems, not wanting in re&s;pect due to &s;uch holy per&s;onages, and never offered to lay a paw on them. At the entrance of St. <HI>Janu|arius</HI>'s pri&s;on, now converted into a chapel, is an in|&s;cription, &s;ignifying, that it was con&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop of <HI>Puzzuoli,</HI> in 1689; and promi&s;ing an indul|gence of forty days, to tho&s;e who devoutly vi&s;it that &s;acred &s;pot in this amphitheatre. <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on at the games celebrated here.</P>
<P>There is a curious antiquity here, called the laby|rinth of <HI>Dedalus;</HI> it is near the amphitheatre, but, by the learned, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a re&s;ervoir to &s;erve the city of Puzzuoli with water. To every one of the&s;e apartments there are four doors, which makes the place extremely intricate. A little further is an arched vault, &s;upported by eleven pillars, incru&s;ted with tartar; and, at pre&s;ent, it is a winec-ellar. This, likewi&s;e, &s;eems to have been a re&s;ervoir. Half a league from Puzzuoli, are the <HI>columbarias,</HI> or tombs, the de&s;cent into which is by ladders. There is nothing very curious in the&s;e repo&s;itories of the dead; they are of a &s;imple &s;tructure, with &s;mall niches, in which urns, filled with the a&s;hes of the family, were depo&s;ited.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="320">This town is chiefly inhabited by fi&s;hermen; their children run after &s;trangers with plates full of mo&s;aic pieces, of various colours; among&s;t which may fre|quently be found medals, intaglios, and engravings on gems; the&s;e the &s;ea throw upon the beach, and are purcha&s;ed for a trifle. Some of them are genuine, but many are fal&s;e; and the&s;e mock antiquities are frequently impo&s;ed on ignorant &s;trangers; which are no more than the refu&s;e of lapidaries &s;hops, procured from Naples; but, whoever has a little intelligence in the&s;e matters, cannot ea&s;ily be deceived.</P>
<P>The ruins of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s villa, near this city, are of &s;uch extent, as to give a high idea of the wealth of this great orator. Had fortune, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> always be&s;towed her gifts with &s;o much propriety, &s;he never would have been accu&s;ed of blindne&s;s. Neither this villa, nor that at Tu&s;culum, nor any of his country-&s;eats, were the &s;cenes of idlene&s;s or riot. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the works he compo&s;ed in them; works which have always been the delight of the learned; and which, &s;till more than the impor|tant &s;ervices he rendered his country, have contri|buted to immortalize his name.</P>
<P>Here it was he wrote both the books, intitled <HI>Quoe&s;|tionum Academicarum.</HI> The ruins of this famous aca|demia of <HI>Cicero,</HI> &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> are a mile and a
<PB N="300" REF="321">
quarter round; but this immen&s;e building is now &s;o demoli&s;hed, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;certaining its regular plan; though we took the trouble of walking, or rather &s;tumbling over the rubbi&s;h, through a num|ber of rooms, we could not find one that could be termed a large one, in a modern Engli&s;h hou&s;e. Some of the pavement &s;till remains, compo&s;ed of &s;mall dies of white marble, forming a mo&s;aic pattern; mo&s;t of the rooms were vaulted, and many of the arches &s;till remain entire.</P>
<P>It is evident that the &s;ea has covered the greate&s;t part of this building, as con&s;iderable ve&s;tiges, which plainly appear to have been part of the &s;tructure, are di&s;|cernable at low water: this is highly probable, for an additional rea&s;on; the academia was &s;o clo&s;e to the &s;ea, as to admit <HI>Cicero</HI>'s gue&s;ts to have amu&s;ed them|&s;elves by fi&s;hing from his windows.</P>
<P>The mole of the harbour of Puzzuoli, is a &s;tupen|dous work. There are now fourteen piles remaining, built with a &s;ort of &s;tone called Piperno, and faced with brick; the&s;e piles are connected by half-ruined arches. The common people u&s;ually call it, <HI>Il ponte di Caligula,</HI> as if it were the ruins of the bridge built by that emperor, from Puzzuoli to Baiae. This error, <HI>Suetonius</HI>'s life of that emperor very &s;atisfactorily Confutes, where he &s;ays, that what <HI>Caligula</HI> built,
<PB N="301" REF="322">
was no more than a bridge of boats, covered with earth, and reaching from Baiae to the Puzzuoli mole; &s;o that the piers are not only plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the moveable bridge of <HI>Caligula,</HI> but he has likewi&s;e called it by the name of moles, which is even now applied to any <HI>congeries</HI> of rocks, or &s;tone, that &s;erves for the &s;ecurity of an harbour. That the pila&s;|ters in the &s;ea, before Puzzuoli, did not belong to a bridge, is likewi&s;e further apparent, from their not being placed in a &s;trait line, but forming a curve towards the North.</P>
<P>The &s;ea, about Puzzuoli, abounds in fi&s;h, e&s;pecially of the te&s;taceous kind. Here is al&s;o a fi&s;h called <HI>Cavallo Marino,</HI> which is not quite an inch in length, and is generally dried for keeping. The head of this little fi&s;h very much re&s;embles that of a hor&s;e: it is often brui&s;ed with vinegar and honey, and ap|plied, by way of plai&s;ter, to the part bitten by a mad dog. This &s;pecies of fi&s;h is al&s;o found on the other &s;ide of Italy, along the coa&s;ts of the Adriatic.</P>
<P>The purple dye of this place was in &s;uch e&s;teem, among the ancient Romans, as to be &s;aid to have ri|valled that of Tyre; it is the blood taken from the vein in the &s;hell-fi&s;h, probably the perriwinkle, and of which there is &s;o &s;mall a quantity, as not to exceed one drop in each fi&s;h.</P>

<P>PURSUING the path towards Naples, &s;ays <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the environs, I ar|rived at a convent of Capuchin Friars, which com|mands &s;o fine a pro&s;pect, that many painters have cho&s;en it as a &s;tation for delineating the bay. Saint <HI>Januarius</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have completed his martyr|dom on this &s;pot, by the axe, after facing the wild bea&s;ts with impunity.

<P>The bay, between Puzzuoli and Baiae, is about three miles in breadth. In the circuit of this bay lies Monte Barbara, anciently Mons Gaurus, the fa|vourite of <HI>Bacchus;</HI> undoubtedly of volcanic origin, though beyond the records of hi&s;tory. It was this mountain, which is now one of the mo&s;t barren &s;pots round Naples, that was formerly &s;o celebrated for its Falernian wine.

<P>Directly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Il Monte Barbaro,</HI> towards the We&s;t, lies <HI>Il Monte Nuovo,</HI> or the new mountain, which ro&s;e in&s;tantaneou&s;ly in the night of the nineteenth of September, 1538, during an earthquake, which cau&s;ed a terrible deva&s;tation in the neighbourhood. "It may &s;eem &s;till more wonderful," &s;ays <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> in his phy&s;ics, "that not only mountains &s;hoot up in the continent, but even i&s;lands in the middle of the &s;ea. As to mountains, nothing can be more notorious than that of Puzzuoli, which was, in one night, formed by
<PB N="304" REF="325">
a congeries of pumice &s;tones and a&s;hes, to the height of above a thou&s;and paces."</P>
<P>Though this alteration happened at the time of an earthquake, it was not cau&s;ed by it; earthquakes, in|deed, often overturn mountains, but never produce any; to do this, the irruption of a volcano is re|quired. <HI>Swinburne,</HI> in his de&s;cription of this pheno|menon, &s;ays, in 1538, after previous notice by re|peated quakings, the convul&s;ed earth bur&s;t a&s;under, and made way for a deluge of hot a&s;hes and flames; which, being &s;hot up to an immen&s;e height into the darkened atm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;phere, fell down again all round, and formed: circular mound, four miles in circum|ference, and one thou&s;and feet high, with a large cup in the middle. Immediately after the explo&s;ion, the wind ro&s;e furiou&s;ly, and wa&s;ted the lighter particles over the country, burning and bla&s;ting all vegetation in its progre&s;s: wherever the&s;e a&s;hes, impregnated with poi&s;on, adhered to the gra&s;s, death became the lot of all bea&s;ts that brou&s;ed upon it. The terrors occa&s;ioned by this &s;hock, threatened the abandonment of the whole di&s;trict; &s;carcely a family dur&s;t remain even within &s;ight of this horrid heap; which had over|whelmed a large town, filled up a lake, and buried under it a very exten&s;ive tract of cultivated lands.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="326">Part of this mountain is cultivated; but the larger portion of its declivity is widely overgrown with prickly broom, and rank weeds, that emit a very foetid, &s;ulphureous &s;mell, The crater is &s;hallow its in&s;ide clad with &s;hrubs, and the little area at the bot|tom planted with fig and mulberry-trees; a mo&s;t &s;triking &s;pecimen of the amazing vici&s;&s;itudes that take place in this extraordinary country.

<P><PB N="307" REF="328">Lake Avernus lies about half a mile di&s;tant, on the left-hand, in the road to Cuma. This lake, like the mountain Gaurus, is exceedingly altered, but much for the better.

<P>The noxious quality attributed to this lake, and the &s;ulphureous exhalations &s;o fatal to birds, who &s;hould attempt to fly over it, are likewi&s;e particularly mentioned in the &s;ixth book of <HI>Virgil.</HI> This lake is at pre&s;ent &s;tocked with variety of good fi&s;h, and the birds not only fly over it unhurt, but wild ducks, and other aquatic fowls are to be &s;een upon it; and the adjacent vineyards produce a very good &s;ort of wine. <HI>Servius (ad Aenead iii. v.</HI> 442.) a&s;cribes the noxious air about this lake, in ancient times, to the thick and lofty woods that then &s;urrounded it, which hindered the di&s;per&s;ion of the effluvia; adding, that <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> having ordered the wood to be cut down and extir|pated,
<PB N="308" REF="329">
the country &s;oon put on a chearful appear|ance.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne,</HI> in his de&s;cription of this lake, tells us that the land&s;cape, though confined, is extremely plea&s;ing; the dark blue &s;urface of the&s;e unruffled waters, &s;aid to be three hundred and &s;ixty feet deep, &s;trongly re|flects the tapering groves, that cover its &s;loping in|clo&s;ure, of about only half a mile in diameter: &s;hoals of wild fowl &s;wim about, and king-fi&s;hers &s;hoot along under the banks; a large octagon temple, in ruins, ad|vances maje&s;tically to the brink; its marble orna|ments have long been removed, but its form and &s;ize render it a noble object. It was, probably, dedicated to the infernal gods, to who&s;e wor&s;hip the&s;e &s;olemn &s;hades were formerly con&s;ecrated. Black aged groves then &s;tretched their boughs over the watery aby&s;s, and, with impenetrable foliage, excluded almo&s;t every ray of whole&s;ome light; mephitic vapours, a&s;cending from the hot bowels of the earth, being denied free pa&s;&s;age to the upper atmo&s;phere, floated along the &s;urface in poi&s;oned mi&s;ts. The&s;e circum&s;tances pro|duced horrors fit for &s;uch gloomy deities; a colony of Cimmerians, as well &s;uited to the rites as to the place it&s;elf, cut dwellings in the bo&s;oms of the &s;ur|rounding hills, and officiated as prie&s;ts of Tartarus. Super&s;tition, always delighting in dark ideas, eagerly &s;eized on this &s;pot, and hither &s;he led her trembling
<PB N="309" REF="330">
votaries, to celebrate her di&s;mal orgies; here &s;he evoked the manes of departed heroes&mdash;here &s;he of|fered &s;acrifices to the gods of hell, and attempted to dive into the &s;ecrets of futurity. Poets enlarged upon the popular theme, and painted its awful &s;cenery with the &s;tronge&s;t colours of their art. <HI>Homer</HI> brings <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to Avernus, as to the mouth of the infernal abodes; and, in imitation of the Grecian bard, <HI>Virgil</HI> con|ducts his hero to the &s;ame ground. The holine&s;s of the&s;e &s;hades remained unimpeached for many ages: <HI>Hannibal</HI> marched his army to offer incen&s;e at this altar.</P>
<P>After a long reign of undi&s;turbed gloom and cele|brity, a &s;udden glare of light was let in upon Aver|nus: the horrors were di&s;pelled, and with them vani&s;hed the &s;anctity of the lake; the axe of <HI>Agrippa</HI> brought its fore&s;t to the ground, di&s;turbed its &s;leepy waters with &s;hips, and gave room for all its malignant effluvia to e&s;cape. Modern writers, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> charge ancient authors with exaggeration, in de&s;crib|ing the virulence of its exhalations; but I think them entitled to more re&s;pect, for even now the air is feveri&s;h and dangerous; as the jaundiced faces of the vine-dre&s;&s;ers, who have &s;ucceeded the Sybils, and the Cimmerians in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temple, mo&s;t ruefully te&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="331"><HI>Boccacio</HI> relates, that during his re&s;idence at the Neapolitan court, the &s;urface of this lake was &s;uddenly covered with dead fi&s;h, black and &s;inged, as if killed by &s;ome &s;ubaqueous eruption of fire. At pre&s;ent it abounds with tench; the Locrine with eels. The change of fortune, in the&s;e lakes, is &s;ingular: in the &s;plendid days of Imperial Rome, the Lucrine was the cho&s;en &s;pot for the parties of plea&s;ure of a vo|luptuous court; they are de&s;cribed by <HI>Seneca,</HI> as the highe&s;t refinement of extravagance and luxury; now a &s;limy bed of ru&s;hes covers the &s;catered ponds of this once beautiful &s;heet of water; and the du&s;ky Aver|nus is now clear and &s;erene; offering a mo&s;t alluring &s;urface and charming &s;cenes for &s;imilar amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite the temple, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> I entered a cave, u&s;ually &s;tiled the Sybils Grotto; it &s;eems more likely to have been the mouth of a communication, between Cuma and Avernus, than the abode of a prophete&s;s; e&s;pecially as the &s;ybil is po&s;itively &s;aid by hi&s;torians, to have dwelt in a cavern under the Cu|maean citadel. A mo&s;t acute and indefatigable un|raveller of antiquarian clews, thinks it was part of the canal that <HI>Nero</HI> projected from the mouth of the Tiber, to the Julian port.</P>
<P>The entrance to the cave of the &s;ybil, as it is com|monly called, is about three yards wide, near five feet
<PB N="311" REF="332">
high, and two hundred and twenty, or two hundred and thirty yards to the end: here is a narrow way, de&s;cending to two &s;mall cells, where there are baths. From the large&s;t of the&s;e, they &s;ay, there is a corri|dore, or pa&s;&s;age, ending in an outlet, now made up with bricks; and that there is a third cell, with a wind|ing &s;tairca&s;e, leading from it to the top of the moun|tain, but now &s;topped up by dirt.</P>
<P><HI>Northall</HI> notices only one room. After advancing about two hundred paces, there is a pa&s;&s;age which leads to &s;ome baths, where the &s;econd grotto is. It is a little room, about fourteen feet long, and eight broad, and of a height proportionable. On the walls are &s;ome &s;mall remains of gilding, and mo&s;aic work: but it &s;eems very my&s;terious, how the &s;ybil could live in &s;o confined a place.</P>
<P><HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> likewi&s;e, who &s;eems to have vi&s;ited this &s;up|po&s;ed re&s;idence of the &s;ybil, notices only one apart|ment, at the extremity of the pa&s;&s;age; in which, &s;ays he, there is a kind of &s;tone trough; by &s;ome antiquarians imagined to be the &s;ybil's bath; and, by others, her bed: on the walls are &s;everal figures, made of &s;mall &s;tones, and &s;hells of different colours, curiou&s;ly ar|ranged. The pavement is al&s;o a mo&s;aic work, but cannot be &s;een di&s;tinctly, as it is covered with water. Here, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> the <HI>Lago Averno</HI> is twenty-five
<PB N="312" REF="333">
fathoms deep, and almo&s;t entirely &s;urrounded with a ri&s;ing ground; &s;o that a canal of communication with the &s;ea, which need not be above the length of half an Italian mile, would make it one of the mo&s;t commodious harbours in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the Lucrine lake, towards the &s;ea, is a hill, with a deep rent on its &s;ummit; which the poor illiterate people are taught to believe, was made at our Saviour's crucifixion; and that it was the pa&s;|&s;age through which he de&s;cended into the <HI>Limbus patrum,</HI> in order to relea&s;e the Patriarchs; and to this &s;uper&s;titious notion, the mountain owes the name of <HI>Il monte di Chri&s;to.</HI></P>
<P>Between Averno, and the city of Cuma, is to be &s;een part of the <HI>Via Appia,</HI> where two hills are joined by means of a noble arch, called <HI>Arco Felice,</HI> built with large bricks; its height is &s;eventy, and its breadth fifty-five feet: the pa&s;&s;age under it is twenty feet four inches. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> but without any probability, to have been a gate of the city of Cuma.</P>
<P>From this high ground, there is a view of the dreary, flat &s;hore of Patria, where, on the edge of a large pond, are &s;ome heaps of &s;tones, the ruins of Liter|num. Hither <HI>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus,</HI> with|drew
<PB N="313" REF="334">
from the accu&s;ations of his enemies, and &s;pent his latter days in philo&s;ophical retirement: by this voluntary exile, he pre&s;erved his per&s;on from in|dignity, without being indebted for his &s;afety to a di&s;pen&s;ation of any po&s;itive, though unju&s;t law of his country. <HI>Seneca</HI> mentions having &s;lept in the villa, which two hundred years before had been the a&s;ylum of that hero: he de&s;cribes it as a &s;ub&s;tantial building, in a garden, &s;urrounded with high walls, and flanked with towers, to defend it again&s;t a &s;udden attack; in it was a ci&s;tern, capable of containing water enough for an army to drink; and, for the private u&s;e of the ma&s;ter, a &s;mall gloomy bath, after the &s;imple fa&s;hion of tho&s;e times. This &s;hore was, probably, le&s;s un|whole&s;ome, when <HI>Scipio</HI> lived here, than it is in its pre&s;ent uncultivated &s;tate, overflowed with foetid pools of bracki&s;h water.</P>
<P>If tradition can be relied on, <HI>Scipio</HI>'s a&s;hes were depo&s;ited here, and the word <HI>Patria</HI> &s;till remaining fixed in the wall of a watch-tower, and giving name to the adjacent lake, is a fragment of his angry epi|taph: <HI>ingrata neque enim mea o&s;&s;a habebis.</HI> "Ungrate|ful country, you &s;hall not even have my bones." It is at lea&s;t certain, that no urn, or monumental in&s;crip|tion, belonging to this illu&s;trious member of the fa|mily, has been found in the &s;epulchre of the <HI>Scipios,</HI> lately di&s;covered at Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="335">From hence, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> we rowed about &s;ix miles Ea&s;tward, to the in&s;ulated rock, on which &s;tood the citadel of Cuma, (the fir&s;t city founded in Italy by Grecian emigrants) once the &s;eat of commerce, the parent of Naples, and the capital of a &s;tate that ruled the &s;eas, before either Rome or Carthage were heard of: its pro&s;perity was of long continuance, while yet the power of infant Rome remained crampt within the narrow limits of her own plains. Under the &s;way of <HI>Ari&s;todemus,</HI> Cuma afforded an a&s;ylum to <HI>Tarquin</HI> the proud, the depo&s;ed king of Rome.</P>
<P>As Rome advanced in her fortunate career, the glory of all her neighbouring powers faded away before her; the Cumaeans, in their turn, &s;ubmitted to the yoke, and were treated with lenity; but real liberty was gone, and the trade abandoned her &s;hores. The Goths reduced it &s;till lower; and at la&s;t, being merely a receptacle for thieves, it was in 1207, totally ruined and for&s;aken.</P>
<P>This rocky hill is the produce of an eruption, and hollowed into many &s;pacious caverns; among&s;t which we look, in vain, for the grotto, where the Cumaean &s;ybil pronounced her oracles; that &s;anctuary was de|&s;troyed in the Gothic war. <HI>Agathias</HI> informs us, that it was &s;cooped into the form of a temple; the roof of which &s;erved as a foundation for one of the prin|cipal
<PB N="315" REF="336">
towers of the fortre&s;s. The hermitage of Wark|worth, in Northumberland, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> celebrated by the pen of Dr. <HI>Percy,</HI> may &s;erve to give an idea of this &s;ybilline grotto. When <HI>Nar&s;es</HI> inve&s;ted the ci|tadel, he cau&s;ed this rocky cover to be cut through in &s;everal directions, and then propped up with beams; as &s;oon as every thing was in readine&s;s for the a&s;&s;ault, the wood was &s;et on fire. Upon the props being con|&s;umed, the rocks gave way, and brought the walls down headlong with them into the temple; and, on the&s;e accumulated ruins, the Imperial troops entered the breach.</P>
<P>Between Cuma and Mi&s;enum, lies the lake <HI>Acheron</HI> or <HI>Palus Acheru&s;ia,</HI> &s;o well known among the an|cients; and, from its black water, is by <HI>Virgil</HI> termed <HI>tenebro&s;a palus,</HI> "the gloomy lake." For the increa&s;e of its fi&s;hery, a canal has been made from the main &s;ea into this lake, by which means the waters of it have been much mended, and rendered fitter for fi&s;h to live in. Mo&s;t of the fi&s;hermen live upon a little i&s;land in the middle of the lake; but the fi&s;h they catch, are chiefly eels and barbles. At pre&s;ent it is called <HI>Lago di Fu&s;aro.</HI> Here, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> my conductors &s;hewed me the ruins of the tomb of <HI>Caius Marius.</HI> As I am apt to believe that popular tales have always &s;ome foundation, however feeble to re&s;t upon; I think it probable, that the a&s;hes of a Roman
<PB N="316" REF="337">
of that name were depo&s;ited here; but it cannot be tho&s;e of the famous Con&s;ul; becau&s;e <HI>Sylla</HI> cau&s;ed his remains to be taken out of the tomb and &s;cattered to the wind.</P>
<P>In the&s;e parts, as our antiquarians tell us, <HI>Servilius Vatia</HI> had a &s;eat, to which he retired under the tyran|nical reign of <HI>Tiberius. Vatia,</HI> on account of the re|treat he had cho&s;en, was cried up as the happie&s;t of the Romans; &s;o that it was a common &s;aying, O <HI>Vatia &s;olus &s;cis vivere:</HI> "O <HI>Vatia,</HI> you alone know how to live." But <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;eems to have been of a different opinion; for, in his fifty-fifth epi&s;tle, he &s;ays, <HI>ille latere &s;ciebat non vivere&mdash;Nunquam aliter hanc villam Vati&acirc; vivo proeteribam, quam ut dicerem. Vatia hic &s;itus e&s;t.</HI> "He knew how to &s;ecrete him&s;elf, not how to enjoy life.&mdash;Nor did I ever pa&s;s his hou&s;e, without &s;aying, <HI>Vatia</HI> lies there."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t below the above lake is the <HI>Mare morto.</HI> The ancients pretend that dead bodies were carried over this lake, from Mi&s;enum to the Ely&s;ian fields. It is a double pool, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> of which the outer di|vi&s;ion is open to the &s;ea; the inner one, occa&s;ionally &s;hut up for the purpo&s;e of fi&s;hing. A &s;lip of &s;and divides it from the channel of Procida; and, at the ex|tremity, ri&s;es the &s;olitary, &s;helving promontory of Mi|&s;eno; the ruins of a city of that name are &s;cattered
<PB N="317" REF="338">
at its foot; and the remains of a theatre very appa|rent. A fine fragment of marble cornice is &s;till left, to bear te&s;timony of the elegance with which it was decorated, in the riche&s;t luxuriance of the compo&s;ite order.</P>

<P>On this penin&s;ula, a villa was built by <HI>Caius Marius,</HI> with a degree of elegance, that gave great offence to the mo&s;t au&s;tere among the Romans, who thought it ill &s;uited to the character of &s;o rough a &s;oldier. Upon the &s;ame foundation, <HI>Lucullus,</HI> the plunderer of the Ea&s;tern world, erected an edifice; in compari&s;on of which, the former hou&s;e was a cottage; but even his
<PB N="318" REF="339">
magnificence was eclip&s;ed by the &s;plendor of the pa|lace, which the emperors rai&s;ed on the &s;ame &s;pot. To the&s;e proud abodes of heroes, and monarchs, which have long been levelled to the ground, a few fi&s;hing huts, and a lonely public-hou&s;e have &s;ucceeded; hither boatmen re&s;ort to tipple, perhaps on the iden|tical &s;ite, where the voluptuous ma&s;ters of the world quaffed Chian and Valernian wine.</P>
<P>Near this &s;pot is the <HI>Pi&s;cina Mirabilis;</HI> it is a &s;ub|terraneous ci&s;tern, divided into alleys, by rows of &s;quare pillars, from which &s;prings an arched roof; the incru&s;tation, formed anciently upon the plai&s;tered walls, by the &s;ediment of the water; is now &s;o &s;trong an alaba&s;ter, as almo&s;t to defy the pick-axe; and &s;o thick and compact, as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of a very fine poli&s;h.</P>
<P>It is much di&s;puted by whom this re&s;ervoir was built. Some attribute it to <HI>Lucullus;</HI> others are of opinion that <HI>Agrippa</HI> had it made, for the conve|nience of the fleet, or for watering the gardens; and the chambers near it, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> called <HI>cento came|relle,</HI> &s;eem to have been de&s;igned for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The channel, where the fleet of <HI>Agrippa</HI> moored, has now but one craggy cobble, &s;tationed to ferry

over pa&s;&s;engers. I cro&s;&s;ed it, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> to the Ely&s;ian fields; which are bounded on the North &s;ide by a &s;mall eminence, covered with vine-bearing trees; the face of the bank is hollowed into number|le&s;s caves, and places of &s;epulture; and an ancient way leads from the ferry towards Capua, between rows of monumental buildings; which by an unu&s;ual permutation of property, from being filled with the a&s;hes of the dead, are now occupied by living pea|&s;ants. The cau&s;e of this road, and its environs, being &s;o uncommonly crouded with tombs, exi&s;ts in the &s;u|per&s;titious creed of the Pagans, who held inhumation nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; and a grave, the only door through which a &s;oul could pa&s;s to a future &s;tate of bli&s;s. According to the &s;pirit of this tenet, neither the inhabitant who died peaceably in his bed at Mi&s;enum, nor the mariner, who met his fate in battle, or in &s;hip|wreck, was &s;uffered by his friends to remain without the honours of a tomb: to every per&s;on, even of mo|derate rank, a &s;uitable mau&s;oleum was erected, to pro|cure for his departed &s;oul, free ingre&s;s into the Ely|&s;ian &s;hades. The&s;e circum&s;tances coincide, admira|bly, with the fables and traditions handed down, con|cerning this country, from a very early period. <HI>Homer</HI> brings <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> hither, and here he fixes the &s;cene of his Stygian machinery; thus the <HI>Mare morto</HI> pa&s;&s;ed for Acheron, and the adjoining fields for the vale of Ely&s;ium, to which the dead were wafted in the boat of

<P>Off this promontory lie the i&s;lands I&s;chia and Pro|cida; well worthy the trouble of a vi&s;it, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> from any curious traveller: the former of the&s;e, for richne&s;s of &s;oil, abundance of products, and beauty of &s;ituation, may vie with the mo&s;t celebrated &s;pots on the globe: the&s;e advantages have drawn many &s;ettlers to its &s;hores, and added eight thou&s;and inhabitants to its li&s;ts, in the la&s;t thirty years.</P>
<P>The ancients believed I&s;chia to have been rai&s;ed out of the bo&s;om of the deep, by the force of central fires: the Chalcydians were the fir&s;t adventurers, that dared to &s;et foot on this igneous &s;oil, and were amply repaid for their riches, by the immen&s;e wealth they drew from the &s;ettlement: however, continual earth|quakes and eruptions, forced them to abandon the place. <HI>Hiero,</HI> king of Syracu&s;e, who was indefatiga|ble, in advancing the commercial intere&s;ts of his do|minions, &s;ent a colony to this i&s;land; but the emolu|ments falling &s;hort of his expectations, he &s;oon with|drew his people; &s;ince that epoch, I&s;chia has u&s;ually obeyed the ma&s;ters of the adjacent continent. All I&s;chia is of fiery origin; but its North-we&s;t angle is more di&s;turbed, and more overturned by eruptions, than any other part of it. On this &s;ide of the i&s;land
<PB N="321" REF="342">
are &s;ome vapour-baths, erected on a neck of land, &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ulphur, and other mine|rals, the u&s;ual concomitants of volcanos.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of a mile, &s;outh of the&s;e &s;udatories, is the town of Foria, inhabited by an indu&s;trious peo|ple; they employ a con&s;iderable number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, in the carriage of their fruit and wines; but, the want of a harbour, expo&s;es them to great lo&s;&s;es in &s;tormy weather. The hou&s;es of this burgh are &s;olidly built; but the &s;treets are almo&s;t too narrow for an a&s;s, with a pair of panniers. The environs are ex|tremely fertile; the young women, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> I met coming down the mountain, with ba&s;kets of figs upon their heads, were tall and hand&s;ome; their fea|tures regularly fine, their eyes &s;parkling, their &s;hape and gait light and airy beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the declivity of the central mountain of the i&s;land, is a crater; circular, &s;hallow, and embanked with a va&s;t mound of cinders; it is full of lava, twi&s;ted and curled, as if, while in a fluid &s;tate, it had been &s;tirred round with a &s;tick. No vegetation has as yet taken place on the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, though they have been expo&s;ed to the air &s;ince the year 1301. The eruption la&s;ted near two months, and cau&s;ed &s;uch de|va&s;tation in the human and animal &s;pecies, by the ma|lignity of its vapours, and poi&s;onous qualities of its

I arrived at the &s;ummit of this mountain, adds <HI>Swinburne,</HI> ju&s;t as the &s;un had extricated his orb out of a ma&s;s of heavy vapours, that &s;till hung upon the Appennine: as his rays diverged, the fogs that floated on the &s;ea vani&s;hed, and a view ro&s;e gradually to the &s;ight, of which &s;o weak a pencil as mine, can never give an adequate idea. As the magnificent view from Mount Epomeo, &s;eems the mo&s;t intere&s;ting object of curio&s;ity in the i&s;land, we &s;hall proceed with our author's de&s;cription of it. The di&s;tant part of the picture, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> di&s;played the mo&s;t ad|mirable marine, and terre&s;trial &s;cenery, while the fore|ground exhibited the richne&s;s of a fertile, populous i&s;land. This va&s;t expan&s;e, of &s;ea and land, lay un|folded before me like a chart; on which every object was marked with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pinnacle of Epomeo, is a white rock of tufa, in the heart of which is hewn a church, cells, galleries, and other conveniences for &s;even hermits, under the patronage of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The&s;e reclu&s;es &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon alms, collected thrice a week about the i&s;land, while the &s;ea&s;on permits; but, during &s;ome months of the year, the &s;now lies &s;o deep in this peak, as to &s;hut them out from all communication with mankind.

The pa&s;&s;age to the cells is contrived to wind through the rock, &s;o as to admit views of almo&s;t every part of the i&s;land; towards the South, the declivity is very gradual to the &s;ea, and cloathed in the riche&s;t garb of vegetative nature; the North &s;ide of the mountain is more abrupt and de&s;titute of verdure; at the foot of its tremendous point lies a circular ba&s;on; from whence, in former times, i&s;&s;ued flames and fiery torrents that overwhelmed the country; but its operations have cea&s;ed, during &s;uch an immen&s;e &s;eries of years, that the borders are tumbled in, and almo&s;t every di&s;tinc|tive feature of a crater obliterated.</P>

<P>This i&s;land gave birth to, or was, at lea&s;t, the pro|perty of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Procida,</HI> a man of great fame in the annals of the thirteenth century. Though rich, and nobly born, this extraordinary per&s;on did not di&s;dain the practice of phy&s;ic; but improved a &s;trong natural genius, by every help the &s;canty knowledge of the age afforded. The great features of his character were &s;agacity, activity, daringne&s;s, and per&s;everance; with the&s;e qualities he undertook to avenge his countrymen of the Provencals; who, under <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> had reduced both Sicilies to &s;lavery, and de&s;troyed the hou&s;e of Suabia. This plan for de&s;troying the French being &s;ettled, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the private meetings of the Sicilians; and, by incendiary di&s;|cour&s;es, fed the fire of di&s;content, till he &s;aw the pro|per moment for blowing it up into a flame: at his nod, though, perhaps, the cri&s;is was ha&s;tened by &s;ome accidental outrages, all Sicily ro&s;e in arms at the fatal &s;ound of the evening bell, known by the name of the

<P>The fi&s;hing, of this little i&s;land, brings in a hand|&s;ome profit, owing to the extraordinary expertne&s;s of the Neapolitan divers. I have frequently known their &s;tay under water, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> to exceed two minutes, and have been a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ome can, and do remain longer. Their common method of taking oy&s;ters, &s;ea-urchins, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, is, to plunge in, head foremo&s;t, among&s;t the rocks; and with a &s;trong knife, wrench the &s;hells off the &s;tones to which they adhere; then, ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, throw their booty into a floating ba&s;ket tied to their foot: but the vio|lence of the exertion, and the pre&s;&s;ure of the water, weaken their lungs, and &s;horten their lives; few reach the age of thirty years. When they go in &s;earch of the razor-fi&s;h, called in Neapolitan <HI>cannolicchi,</HI> they walk up to their &s;hins in the &s;ea, backwards and for|wards, with the greate&s;t gravity and attention; moving their feet &s;ideways along the &s;and, till they feel the &s;harp edge of a razor-&s;hell, then they dart down with amazing rapidity, and &s;eize their prey. From this &s;tately deportment, comes the local proverbial ex|pre&s;&s;ion, of a per&s;on walking about in a brown &s;tudy; he is fi&s;hing for <HI>cannolicchi.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="347">In the center of the gulph, of which this fragment of Cape Mi&s;enum makes the extreme We&s;tern point, are the mutilated remnants of Baiae, that elegant re|&s;ort of the gay ma&s;ters of the world. The hot &s;prings, and medicinal vapours that abound in its environs, mu&s;t very early have excited the attention of valetu|dinarians; as bathing was the con&s;tant &s;olace of the Greeks while in health, and their remedy when di&s;|ea&s;ed: but Baiae does not &s;eem to have attained a degree of celebrity &s;uperior to that of other baths, till the Roman commonwealth began to be in the wane. As &s;oon as the plunder of a conquered world was transferred, from works of public u&s;e and orna|ment, to objects of private luxury; the tran&s;cendent advantages, which Baiae offered to Roman volup|tuaries, flying from the capital in &s;earch of health and plea&s;ure, were attended to with enthu&s;ia&s;m: the va|riety of its natural baths, the &s;oftne&s;s of its climate, and the beauties of its land&s;cape, captivated the minds of opulent nobles, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for bathing knew no bounds; abundance of linen, and di&s;u&s;e of ointments, render the practice le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in modern life; but the ancients performed no exerci&s;e, engaged in no &s;tudy, without previous ablutions, which at Rome re|quired an enormous expence in aqueducts, &s;tones, and and attendants: a place, therefore, where waters na|turally heated to every degree of warmth, bubbled &s;pontaneou&s;ly out of the ground, in the plea&s;ante&s;t of

all &s;ituations, was &s;uch a trea&s;ure, as could not be overlooked. Hither, at fir&s;t, retired for a temporary relaxation, the mighty rulers of the empire, to &s;tring anew their nerves, and revive their &s;pirits, fatigued with bloody campaigns and civil conte&s;ts. Their ha|bitations were &s;mall and mode&s;t; but, &s;oon, increa&s;ing luxury added palace to palace; &s;o that ground was wanting for the va&s;t demand. Enterpri&s;ing architects, &s;upported by infinite wealth, carried their foundations into the &s;ea, and drove that element back from its limits; it has &s;ince taken ample revenge, and reco|vered much more than it ever lo&s;t.</P>
<P>From being a place of re&s;ort, for a &s;ea&s;on, Baiae now grew up to a permanent city; whoever found him&s;elf di&s;qualified by age, or infirmity, for &s;u&s;taining any longer an active part on the political theatre; who|ever, from an indolent di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ought a place, where the plea&s;ures of the town were combined with the &s;weets of a rural life; whoever wi&s;hed to with|draw from the dangerous neighbourhood of a court, and the baneful eye of informers, flocked hither, to enjoy life, untainted with fear and trouble. Such af|fluence rendered Baiae as much a miracle of art, as it was before of nature; its &s;plendor may be inferred from its innumerable ruins, heaps of marbles, mo&s;aics, and other precious fragments of ta&s;te.</P>

Lo&s;s of fortune left the Romans neither the means, nor, indeed, the thought of &s;upporting &s;uch expen&s;ive e&s;ta|bli&s;hments; which can only be enjoyed in perfection, during peace and pro&s;perity. No &s;ooner had opu|lence withdrawn her hand, than the unbridled &s;ea ru&s;hed upon its old domain; moles and buttre&s;&s;es were torn a&s;under, and wa&s;hed away; whole promon|tories, with the proud towers that once crowned their brows, were undermined, and tumbled headlong into the deep; where, many feet below the &s;urface, pave|ments of &s;treets, foundations of hou&s;es, and ma&s;&s;es of walls may &s;till be de&s;cried. Internal commotions of the earth contributed al&s;o largely to this general deva&s;|tation; mephitic vapours, and &s;tagnated waters, have converted this favourite &s;eat of health into the den of pe&s;tilence, at lea&s;t during the e&s;tival heats; yet Baiae, in its ruined &s;tate, and &s;tripped of all its ornaments, &s;till pre&s;ents many beautiful and &s;triking &s;ubjects for the pencil.</P>

<P>At the bottom of the bay, and at the foot of the &s;teep rocks; which &s;erve as a foundation to the ruins, called <HI>Nero</HI>'s hou&s;e, are &s;ome dark caves of great depth, leading to the hotte&s;t of all vapour baths: no one can remain long in them, or, indeed, penetrate to the end, without an extraordinary degree of &s;trength and re&s;olution. The&s;e baths, thirty in number, are &s;aid to have been adorned with Greek in&s;criptions, and &s;tatues, denoting by their expre&s;&s;ions and atti|tudes, what particular part of the human frame was af|fected and relieved from its pains, by each particular bath. <HI>Parrino</HI> informs us, that three phy&s;icians of Salerno, apprehen&s;ive of the ruin, that the &s;urprizing efficacy and reputation of the&s;e waters would bring upon their college, came hither in the dead of the night, mutilated the figures, defaced the letters, and, as far as their time would allow, di&s;turbed the cour&s;e of the &s;prings; but the hi&s;torian adds, very gravely, that Hygeia, ever watchful over the health of Naples, revenged this barbarous outrage, by conjuring up a

&s;torm, that buried the three doctors in the &s;ea, before they could reach their home or triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of their villainy. The &s;prings at the bottom of the grotto are &s;o hot, as to boil an egg hard almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly. <HI>Martyn</HI> &s;ays, the&s;e baths are much fre|quented; and that there are &s;ometimes, from the ho&s;|pitals of the annunciation alone at Naples, above nine hundred patients.</P>
<P>As for the city of Baiae, which &s;tood on this coa&s;t, there is not the lea&s;t remains to be &s;een of it. The fort, lately built here, is called Baia, and &s;tands upon a rock; but the air of it is &s;o unwhole&s;ome, that the governor &s;leeps every night at Puzzuoli, which is on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bay, about three miles di&s;tant. Sometimes pri&s;oners are brought to this fort, which is more dreaded than any other pri&s;on in Italy.</P>
<P>On the &s;ea &s;hore, facing Baiae, is an ancient temple of <HI>Mercury,</HI> which may be looked upon as the pan|theon in miniature, for it is not above twenty-five common paces in diameter. It is quite round, with an aperture in the center of the roof, for the admi&s;&s;ion of light; two per&s;ons, directly oppo&s;ite to each other, and whi&s;pering clo&s;e to the wall, may conver&s;e with each other, without being overheard by the company in the middle.</P>

<P>Near <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI>'s villa is &s;hewn an ancient ruin, &s;aid to have been the monument of <HI>Agrippina,</HI> who was put to death by <HI>Nero,</HI> her own &s;on.

<P>Between Baia and Cape Mi&s;eno, are, likewi&s;e, &s;everal other remains of antiquity; but, by the ex|planations of them, are mo&s;tly grounded on uncer|tain conjectures, Among other pieces, there has been dug up hereabouts, a &s;tatue of <HI>Venus,</HI> twice as big as the life, holding a globe in one hand, and three golden apples in the other; from whence &s;ome anti|quarians conclude, that <HI>Venus Genetrix</HI> mu&s;t have had a temple in this neighbourhood; and, as <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar</HI> had a country-&s;eat near Baiae, others &s;till farther alledge, that he founded and built this temple.</P>

<P>HAVING now taken a view of the environs Ea&s;t of Naples, we will proceed to the We&s;tern &s;ide, which is no le&s;s intere&s;ting, on account of Hercula|neum, Pompeii, and the mu&s;eum at Portici.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="357">A broad, level road, by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and through a village, where many of the nobility have villas, leads to the palace at Portici, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from which is the entrance into Herculaneum; a city buried by a torrent of lava, that i&s;&s;ued from the mountain, in the fir&s;t year of the emperor <HI>Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI> The thick|ne&s;s of the heap that covers it, has been much in|crea&s;ed, by fiery &s;treams vomited, &s;ince that cata|&s;trophe, and now forms a ma&s;s of twenty-four feet deep of dark-grey &s;tone, which is ea&s;ily broken to pieces. By its non-adhe&s;ion to foreign bodies, marbles, and bronzes, are pre&s;erved in it, as in a ca&s;e made to fit them; and exact moulds, of the faces and limbs of &s;tatutes, are frequently found in this &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The elder <HI>Pliny</HI> lo&s;t his life in this irruption; he, and his companions, &s;ays his nephew, the younger <HI>Pliny,</HI> went out from his hou&s;e in order to e&s;cape. They had pillows upon their heads, with napkins, as the be&s;t and only defence again&s;t the &s;torms of &s;tones that fell around them. It was day every where el&s;e, but here a deeper darkne&s;s prevailed than in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure night; which, in &s;ome degree however, was di&s;&s;ipated by torches, and other lights of various kinds. They proceeded as far on the &s;hore as they could, in hopes of finding &s;ome means of putting out to &s;ea, but found the waves run extremely high and boi&s;terous.

uncle having drank a draught or two of cold water, threw him&s;elf down upon a cloth, that was &s;pread for him; when, immediately the flames, and a &s;trong &s;mell of &s;ulphur, which was the forerunner of them, di&s;|per&s;ed the re&s;t of the company, and obliged him to ri&s;e. He rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two of his &s;ervants, and in&s;tantly fell down dead; &s;uffo|cated, as I conjecture, by &s;ome gro&s;s and noxious va|pour, having always had weak lungs, and frequently &s;ubject to a difficulty of breathing.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e &s;ituation, of this &s;ubterraneous city, was not known till the year 1713; when it was acci|dentally di&s;covered by &s;ome labourers, who, in dig|ging a well, &s;truck upon a &s;tatue on the benches of the theatre. Many others were afterwards dug out, and &s;ent to France by the prince of Elbeuf; but little progre&s;s was made in the excavation, till <HI>Charles,</HI> infanta of Spain, a&s;cended the Neapolitan throne: by his unwearied efforts, and liberality, a very con&s;ide|rable part of Herculaneum has been explored; and &s;uch trea&s;ures of antiquity drawn out, as form the mo&s;t curious mu&s;eum in the world. It being too arduous a ta&s;k to attempt removing the covering, the king contented him&s;elf with cutting galleries to the principal buildings, and cau&s;ing the extent of one or two of them to be cleared: of the&s;e the theatre is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. On a balu&s;trade, which di|vided
<PB N="338" REF="360">
the orche&s;tra from the &s;tage, was found a row of &s;tatues; and, on each &s;ide of the pulpitum, the eque&s;trian figure of a per&s;on of the Nonian family; they are now placed under the porticos of the palace; and, from the great rarity of eque&s;trian &s;tatues in marble, would be very valuable objects, were their workman&s;hip even le&s;s excellent than it is; one of them, in particular, is a very fine piece of &s;culp|ture.</P>
<P>Since the King of Spain left Naples, the digging has been continued, but with le&s;s &s;pirit and expen|diture; indeed, the collection of curio&s;ities brought out of Herculaneum and Pompeii, is already &s;o con|&s;iderable, that a relaxation of zeal and activity be|comes excu&s;eable.</P>
<P>This city, &s;ays <HI>Northall,</HI> mu&s;t have been &s;ituated where Portici is at pre&s;ent, for we knew we cro&s;&s;ed under the main &s;treet, by hearing the coaches rattle over our heads. It has been called by the poets, the city, or the &s;alt-pits of <HI>Hercules. Urbs Herculea, Sa|linoe Herculeoe.</HI> This was one of the mo&s;t ancient cities of Europe, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built before the Trojan war. <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> of Halicarna&s;&s;us, relates, that it was founded by <HI>Hercules;</HI> and, though many of the relations of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> are fabulous, yet there are many rea&s;ons why his account of this city
<PB N="339" REF="361">
ought not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or rejected. According to him, <HI>Hercules,</HI> having de&s;troyed the tyrants and rob|bers, who infe&s;ted Spain and Gaul, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, and entered Italy, where he built Pompeia, and after|wards Herculaneum, at which place his fleet met him. The Romans became ma&s;ters of the city, two hundred and ninety-three years before Chri&s;t. The agreeable &s;ituation of this coa&s;t induced many Romans to build villas there; and it appears there were &s;everal at Her|culaneum. <HI>Cicero</HI> mentions one belonging to <HI>Fabius</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> another built by <HI>C. Coe&s;ar.</HI> It appears, likewi&s;e, by a de&s;cription given by <HI>Statius,</HI> of the&s;e villas, that they were decorated with the fine&s;t paint|ings and &s;culpture, by <HI>Aleppo, Phidias, Polycletus,</HI> and other Greek ma&s;ters; which will account for the great number of exqui&s;ite remains, of ancient art, found in the city of Herculaneum.</P>
<P>It is at Portici, &s;ix miles from Naples, that the &s;uperb mu&s;eum of antiques, found at Herculaneum and Pompeia, is depo&s;ited. Were there nothing but the cabinet of Portici and Pompeia, worth viewing in Italy, they alone would con&s;iderably repay any tra|veller, for all the inconveniences he mu&s;t &s;uffer from bad roads, bad inns, &amp;c. &s;hould they be even more wretched, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> than &s;ome that we have experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="362">From the&s;e gloomy vaults, &s;peaking of the de&s;cent into Herculaneum, I returned, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> with eagerne&s;s, to contemplate the riches they once con|tained, now arranged in a wing of the palace of Por|tici. This mu&s;eum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not only &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, altars, in&s;criptions, and other ornamental appendages of opulence and luxury, but al&s;o an entire a&s;&s;ortment of the dome&s;tic, mu&s;ical, and chirurgical in&s;truments u&s;ed by the ancients; tripods of elegant form and ex|qui&s;ite execution; lamps in endle&s;s variety; va&s;es and ba&s;ons of noble dimen&s;ions; chandeliers of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;hapes; pateras and other appurtenances of &s;acrifice; looking-gla&s;&s;es of poli&s;hed metal; coloured gla&s;s, &s;o hard, clear, and well &s;tained, as to appear like emeralds, &s;apphires, and other precious &s;tones; a kitchen completely fitted up with copper pans, lined with &s;ilver; kettles, ci&s;terns for heating water, and every nece&s;&s;ary for culinary purpo&s;es; &s;pecimens of various &s;orts of eatables, retaining their form, though burnt to a cinder; corn, bread, fi&s;h, oil, wine, and flour; a lady's toilet, fully furni&s;hed with combs, thimbles, rings, paint, ear-rings, &amp;c. the bu&s;ts fill &s;e|veral rooms; but very few of the originals, whom they are meant to imitate, are known. The floors are paved with ancient mo&s;aic; few rare medals have been found in the&s;e ruins; the mo&s;t curious is a gold medallion of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;truck in Sicily, when he had been &s;aluted emperor fifteen times. The fre&s;co paint|ings,
<PB N="341" REF="363">
which, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ervation, have been torn off the walls, and framed and glazed, are to be &s;een in another part of the palace; the elegance of the attitudes, and the infinite variety of the &s;ubjects, &s;tamp them as performances worthy of the attention of arti&s;ts and antiquarians; but no pictures, yet found, are ma&s;terly enough to prove, that the Greeks car|ried the art of painting, to &s;o great a height of per|fection, as they did that of &s;tatuary; yet, can we &s;up|po&s;e, tho&s;e authors incapable of appreciating the merits of an <HI>Apelles</HI> or a <HI>Zeuxis;</HI> who, with &s;o much critical di&s;cernment, have pointed out the beauties of the works of a <HI>Phidias</HI> or a <HI>Praxiteles;</HI> beauties, that we have &s;till an opportunity of contemplating? Would they have be&s;towed equal prai&s;es on both kinds of performances, if either of them had been much in|ferior to the other? I think it is not probable, and we mu&s;t pre&s;ume, that the capital productions of ancient painters, being of more peri&s;hable materials than bu&s;ts and &s;tatues, have been de&s;troyed in the fatal di&s;a&s;ters that have &s;o often afflicted both Greece and Italy. Herculaneum and Pompeii were but towns of the &s;econd order; and not likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ma&s;ter-pieces of the great arti&s;ts, which were u&s;ually de&s;tined to adorn the more celebrated temples, or the palaces of kings and emperors.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="364">A more valuable acqui&s;ition, than bronzes and pic|tures, were thought to be made, when a large parcel of manu&s;cripts was found among the ruins; hopes were entertained, that many works of the cla&s;&s;icks, which time has deprived us of, were now going to be re&s;tored to light; and that a new mine of &s;cience was on the point of being opened. But the difficulty of unrolling the burnt parchment, of pa&s;ting the frag|ments on a flat &s;urface, and of decyphering the ob|&s;cure letters, have proved &s;uch ob&s;tacles, that very little progre&s;s has been made in the work. A prie&s;t invented the method of proceeding; but it would re|quire the joint labours of many learned men, to carry on &s;o nice and tedious an operation, with any &s;ucce&s;s. Perhaps, &s;uch an employment would be well calcula|ted to fill up the idle hours of the nuns; who&s;e delicate fingers are be&s;t adapted to &s;o nice an operation. At pre&s;ent, the work is &s;u&s;pended, and manu&s;cripts lie in du&s;ty heaps, as u&s;ele&s;s to the learned world, as they had been for the preceding &s;eventeen centuries. One volume, that was unrolled and completely read, con|tained a Greek treati&s;e, again&s;t the bad effects of mu&s;ic in a republic.</P>
<P>Among the antique marbles, the figures of animals, as well the fabulous, as tho&s;e that imitate nature, are finely done; they were u&s;ed to convey water into the baths, and there is much humour expre&s;&s;ed in their
<PB N="343" REF="365">
countenance; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the chimeras, ba|&s;ili&s;ks, &amp;c. An elegant &s;tatue of <HI>Diana,</HI> in white marble carved after the purple gown, worn by the Roman ladies of antiquity; the garment is edged with a lace, exactly re&s;embling point; it is about an inch and an half broad, and has been purple and gilt, great part of which &s;till remains. The &s;tatue, bu&s;ts, bas-reliefs, in bronze, which are very numerous, are of &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite workman&s;hip, that it is not in the power of the mo&s;t able arti&s;t of this day, to execute repre&s;entations, in metal of any kind, that can rival, or even bear a competition with many of them.</P>
<P>All the rooms, about ten in number, are paved with antique mo&s;aic, exactly as they found their pre|&s;ent floors in Herculaneum; the&s;e rooms, being con|&s;tructed of &s;imilar dimen&s;ions for their reception; and no two of them are of the &s;ame pattern, <HI>The Al'y Grec</HI> borders, encompa&s;s every different floor, and are cu|rious in their regularity, and linear intricacy. One pavement particularly de&s;erves notice, it repre&s;ents a Roman camp, forming an exact &s;quare; in the middle, of each &s;ide, is a gate fronting the center. Towers of three &s;tories high, at equal di&s;tances, encompa&s;s the whole; they are all alike in &s;ize, except tho&s;e at the angles, which appear larger, and more con&s;iderable than the others. The &s;eats, for the mu&s;icians, found in the orche&s;tra at Herculaneum, are curious; the
<PB N="344" REF="366">
frames and legs being &s;till perfect; they are of bronze, and have been gilt; &s;ome of the gilding &s;till remains; the legs repre&s;ent two &s;erpents on each &s;ide of the &s;tool; which, forming a kind of cro&s;s, &s;omewhat like two Ss, de&s;cribe the &s;erpentine line of beauty, and produce a mo&s;t graceful effect. Here are al&s;o in|&s;criptions, &s;etting forth the names of tho&s;e who u&s;ed the bath at Stabia.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the uten&s;ils in bronze, the &s;cales and weights de&s;erve notice, for the delicacy of their work|man&s;hip. It appears, that the weights commonly u&s;ed, were bu&s;ts of gods, or heroes, &s;u&s;pended by a ring. The &s;cales are of various &s;izes; be&s;ides a great many in&s;truments for weighing, like tho&s;e called in England &s;teelyards; to which the weights, re&s;embling human figures, &s;eem to have belonged. The moulds for ices, and various in&s;truments for ornamenting pa&s;try, clearly prove the luxury of tho&s;e times to have far exceeded, in fertility of invention, that of our day: a great va|riety of &s;trainers, pierced in the mo&s;t curious manner, and which are frequently found in pairs, one fitting into the other; but, for what u&s;e de&s;igned, is not ea&s;y to determine; many of them are in &s;ilver, others in bronze. Here are culinary uten&s;ils, of more various &s;hapes and &s;izes, than can be found in the be&s;t fur|ni&s;hed modern kitchen.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="367">One of the&s;e rooms is built, and furni&s;hed, in the exact conformity with a kitchen di&s;covered entire; it contains a number of articles, many of them &s;o com|plicated, that their u&s;e does not clearly appear; each ve&s;&s;el is of bronze, and of fine workman&s;hip: upon the whole, it &s;eems indi&s;putable, that the ancients em|ployed more refinements in their entertainments, than the moderns; and mu&s;t have &s;erved up a much greater variety of di&s;hes than we do. The dre&s;&s;ers, &s;tew-holes, &s;toves, boilers, fi&s;h-kettles, re&s;emble ours, though they &s;eem to have been better contrived. The lamps to light the apartments, and the candelabras to &s;u&s;tain them, &s;hew a &s;urpri&s;ing fertility of invention and execution. Here are al&s;o tunable bells, of dif|ferent &s;izes, for their cattle, re&s;embling tho&s;e in Eng|land, called <HI>tintinabula;</HI> al&s;o keys, letters to &s;tamp with, perhaps to mark linen; in&s;truments of agricul|ture, &s;urgery and mathematics. Another article, of culinary u&s;e, which would be very convenient and agreeable in England, is a kind of portable kitchen, which does not exceed the &s;ize of a commodious plate-warmer; in the center is a va&s;e for water; under it a furnace for fire, with an invention for boiling meat at the &s;ame time that it heats the water; this va&s;e has a double bottom, and three little flews, or chimneys for carrying off the &s;moke; the double bot|tom admits of &s;tewing any thing in the manner called by the French <HI>&agrave; la brai&s;e:</HI> this would be a mo&s;t con|venient

They have cups and &s;aucers in &s;ilver, of &s;uperior &s;culpture to any I have ever yet &s;een; and re&s;embling in make tho&s;e now u&s;ed for tea and cof|fee: their handles are &s;o curiou&s;ly contrived, as to balance them, and prevent their overturning, however carele&s;sly held when full.</P>
<P>The in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, I particularly remarked, are the following; the &s;eringa, or flute of &s;everal notes, formed of bone, and which may be frequently &s;een as the in&s;ignia, in painting, if not always accom|panying the God <HI>Pan,</HI> and the &s;atyrs: the <HI>Crotali;</HI> the&s;e are like ba&s;ons, or deep &s;aucers, with broad brims; they were &s;truck again&s;t each other, and are of bra&s;s. The <HI>Si&s;trum,</HI> in &s;hape like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, cro&s;&s;ed by &s;everal wires pa&s;&s;ing through holes, and &s;o made, as to admit of their &s;lipping from &s;ide to &s;ide; when this in&s;trument is waved by the hand, the wires produce a loud noi&s;e. The <HI>Tibioe,</HI> or double flute; this is made of metal.</P>
<P>In armoury are many &s;hields, iron boots, &s;pears, &amp;c. In &s;hort, were we to de&s;cribe all the curious articles, that have been dug out of this celebrated city, it would fill a volume. Such accounts have been publi&s;hed, and to the&s;e we mu&s;t refer the reader,

<P>Sixteen miles North of Naples &s;tood the ancient city of Capua; which is &s;aid, at one period, to have vied in magnificence with Rome and Carthage. <HI>Han|nibal</HI>'s army is &s;aid to have been conquered by the luxuries of this place. Whether Capua brought on the ruin of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> or not, it is certain that <HI>Hannibal</HI> occa&s;ioned the ruin of Capua. The Capuans, having broken their connexion with Rome, and formed an alliance with her enemy, were be&s;ieged by <HI>Fulvius</HI> and <HI>Appius. Hannibal</HI> exerted all his abilities for his new friends, but was not able to bring the Romans to a battle, or to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and Capua fell a victim. Capua was a flouri&s;hing city, three hundred and fifty years before the birth of Chri&s;t; and, in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> contained three hundred thou&s;and inhabi|tants, and a great number of magnificent buildings. It continued in a &s;tate of grandeur during the conti|nuance of the Roman empire, but afterwards &s;uffered greatly from the Goths; next fell into the hands of the Lombards, and was, at la&s;t, burnt by the Saracens, in 842. Twelve years after this, its inhabitants removed to New Capua, then built, about three miles from it. Several villages are erected on the &s;cite of Old Capua, and one of them bears its name; but the only remains of its former grandeur, worth noticing, is an amphi|theatre;
<PB N="348" REF="370">
the lower order, Tu&s;can, with a Doric over it. In its pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, the architecture ap|pears clum&s;y; it was built with brick, and faced with &s;tone or marble; but the facing is all carried off. Many of the ruins have been removed into the new town; the walls of the town-hou&s;e are lined with them, and exhibit gigantic grote&s;que heads, which adorned the key-&s;tones of the amphitheatre; private hou&s;es are al&s;o enriched with fragments of the&s;e ruins, and the Cathedral can boa&s;t of many of them.</P>
<P>Modern Capua is but a &s;mall place, fortified with a rampart. The &s;treets are narrow, dirty, ill-paved, and thin of people. There is but one inn in the town, yet it is an archbi&s;hopric. No city in Italy contains a greater number of ancient in&s;criptions, brought here from old Capua; and a &s;tatue, of king <HI>Charles</HI> II. of Spain, is erected in the market-place. The country, between this and Naples, (di&s;tance &s;ix|teen miles) is fertile, and delightful in the extreme. The cau&s;eway, though of a much later date than the Appian way, it is not at all inferior to it; and, in many parts, the rows of trees, planted on each &s;ide, form a fine vi&s;to, more than a mile in length. The country, on each &s;ide, is diver&s;ified with corn-fields, gardens, and vineyards; and the vines climbing up the lofty trees, and interwoven with their luxurious branches, from a kind of natural fe&s;toon.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="371">The king is building a palace at Ca&s;&s;erta, on the plain where ancient Capua &s;tood, out of all propor|tion to the revenues of the kingdom; and, when fini&s;hed, will be one of the mo&s;t &s;pacious and magni|ficent palaces in Europe. This immen&s;e building is of a quadrangular form, 750 feet Engli&s;h, by 580; about 112 feet high, comprehending five habitable &s;tories, which contain &s;uch a number of apartments, as will accommodate the mo&s;t numerous court, without any acce&s;&s;ary buildings.</P>
<P>The quadrangule is divided into four courts, each about 252 feet by 170. In each of the two princi|pal fronts are three corre&s;ponding gates; forming three openings, which pierce the whole building. The middle gates form the entry to a magnificent portico, for coaches. The grand &s;tairca&s;e is adorned with the riche&s;t marble; and all the apartments corre&s;pond with the external appearance. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us, that when he was there in 1777, among the workmen em|ployed in fini&s;hing this palace, were one hundred and fifty Africans, taken pri&s;oners from the &s;tates of Bar|bary, with whom Naples is always at war. There were about as many Chri&s;tian &s;laves, condemned to work there, for crimes again&s;t the laws; they are, however, better cloathed and fed than the Africans.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="372">The gardens, belonging to this palace, are equally exten&s;ive and magnificent. A great number of fine &s;tatues, mo&s;t of them copies of the be&s;t antiques, are there in readine&s;s to &s;et up, when the gardens are fini&s;hed; which, probably, are by this time. Here was a very large elephant, kept by African &s;laves. In the garden is an artificial water, and an i&s;land with a kind of ca&s;tle on it, regularly fortified, and a nu|merous train of artillery; &s;ome of them nine or ten pounders. I no &s;ooner entered this fort, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> than I wi&s;hed uncle Toby and corporal Trim had been of our party; it would have charmed the &s;oul of the worthy veteran, and his faithful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>At Lorrento, on a bay of the &s;ea, eighteen or twenty miles South of Naples, the town that gave birth to <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> in 1544, are the noble ruins of a villa men|tioned in <HI>Statius</HI>'s <HI>Sylvoe,</HI> that belonged to <HI>Pollius Foelix;</HI> it appears to have been accurately de&s;cribed by that poet; for, though the &s;maller features are disfigured, the great out-lines of the place are &s;till di&s;cernable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP VIII.</HI> Of the &s;everal Cities, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AVELLINO is a city, about thirty miles we&s;t of Naples, in the road to Tarento; we enter it by a fine avenue, a mile long, between two rows of poplars, remarkable for their height, bulk, and clo&s;e|ne&s;s of foliage. The country, from Naples, is delight|ful; particularly the immen&s;e plains of Nola, (remark|able for the invention of bells) which are one entire grove of tall elms and poplars, planted in rows, to &s;upport the vines growing at their feet, and &s;tretching their branches from tree to tree, in beautiful garlands. Between the lines, the hu&s;bandman &s;ows corn and pul&s;e, without any fallow; and, to prevent the land from being exhau&s;ted, rai&s;es early crops of Lupins and beans, which he hoes up before they &s;eed, and buries for manure. The harrowing, and rolling, is performed by oxen. This &s;oil is a &s;andy volcanic loam, very rich and vegetative.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="374">Avellino is a con&s;iderable city, extending a mile in length, down the declivity of a hill, with ugly &s;treets, but tolerable hou&s;es. The churches have nothing to recommend them, being crouded with mon|&s;trous ornaments, in a barbarous &s;tile, apparently bor|rowed from the Spaniards. The cathedral is a poor building. The good people of this town need not run to Naples, to &s;ee the blood of St. <HI>Januarius;</HI> for they have a &s;tatue of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> with a phial of his blood; which, for eight days in Augu&s;t, entertains them with a &s;imilar miraculous liquefaction. Their only edifice of note is a public granary, of the com|po&s;ite order, adorned with antique &s;tatues, and a very elegant one, in bronze, of <HI>Charles</HI> II. king of Spain, whil&s;t a boy. The number of inhabitants is between eight and ten thou&s;and. The bi&s;hop's revenue about 1,125l. &s;terling a year. The magi&s;tracy con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;yndic, and four eletti, all annual; which offices are engro&s;&s;ed by a certain number of families, that neither inter-marry, nor a&s;&s;ociate with the re&s;t of the burghers. There is a manufactory here that dyes cloth, made up of various qualities and colours, but chiefly blue; the duty of which brings in a revenue, to the prince, of 3,750l. yearly. They make al&s;o here, a great deal of macaroni, which is in great repute all over the country.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="375">Avellino abounds with cattle and provi&s;ions of every kind; a good mule &s;ells for eleven pounds Engli&s;h, and a bullock for nine pounds. Each &s;treet is &s;upplied with whole&s;ome water, but their wine is in|different. The volcanic &s;oil produces little corn, but fruit in abundance, particularly the hazel nut. Nut-bu&s;hes cover the face of the valley; and, in prolific years, bring in a profit of 60,000 ducats, equal to 11,250l. Engli&s;h. They are what we call Spani&s;h nuts.</P>
<P>The women of this neighbourhood are hand&s;ome, and take great pains to deck out their per&s;ons to ad|vantage. Once a week they wa&s;h their hair, with a lye of wood a&s;hes, that changes it from a dark brown to a flaxen yellow, of many different tints in the &s;ame head of hair. This I take, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> to be the true <HI>flava Coe&s;aries</HI> of the Latin poets. Experience has taught me to di&s;cover many traces of ancient cu&s;|toms, in the modes and habits of the modern Italians.

<P>In de&s;cending the la&s;t ridge of hills, between the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern courts of Italy, we come into the exten&s;ive plains of Puglia; in the center of which &s;tands Foggia, a principal town of the province of Capitanata, without walls, citadel, or gates. It is neatly built of white &s;tone, and has two or three good &s;treets. The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e has a hand&s;ome edifice. This town, with many others on the coa&s;t of the Adri|atic, was ruined in 1732, by an earthquake, and has been rebuilt with neatne&s;s and regularity. In &s;um|mer the air is unwhole&s;ome; and all, who can remove, de&s;ert it, during the hot months. In winter, it con|tains twenty thou&s;and inhabitants, including &s;trangers. All the large &s;treets, and open &s;quares, are undermined with vaults, where corn is buried, and pre&s;erved &s;ound, from year to year.</P>
<P>This town has been of &s;ome con&s;equence in former years, and &s;till is, being a &s;taple for corn and wool,
<PB N="356" REF="378">
and where the toll of &s;heep is paid to and from Puglia; for va&s;t quantities of &s;heep de&s;cend in autumn from the mountains of Abruzzo, into the warm plains of Puglia, to yean; and, in May, return to the high country. The invention of this duty is a&s;cribed, by <HI>Varro,</HI> to the ancient Romans; who, on &s;ubduing the Italian &s;tates, were accu&s;tomed to allot the improved lands to their non-citizens; whil&s;t they left the wa&s;tes, and le&s;s cultivated tracts, to the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, on their paying a tenth of the produce of the corn-lands, and a fifth of all other fruits. Breeders of cattle and &s;heep, were to compound with the cen&s;ors. In later times, the emperor appropriated all &s;uch common lands to them&s;elves, and cau&s;ed them to be con&s;idered as royalties. As this traffic increa&s;ed, the crown, not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ufficient range of pa&s;ture for the great flocks, purcha&s;ed other lands of the Puglian pro|prietors. The&s;e royal pa&s;tures are bounded by &s;tones, and are known by the name of <HI>Taooliere;</HI> they ex|tend &s;ixty miles in length, and thirty in breadth, and are capable of feeding one million, two hundred thou&s;and &s;heep: in return, the &s;hepherds of Abruzzo bound them&s;elves for ever, to drive their flocks here yearly, from the mountains, and to pay certain duties, or toll, for every one hundred head of &s;heep. This duty is called the <HI>dogana,</HI> and is one of the riche&s;t mines of wealth, belonging to the crown of Naples. It has been continually increa&s;ing. Soon after its in|&s;titution,
<PB N="357" REF="379">
it cleared 72,000 ducats; in 1730, it pro|duced 235,972. At pre&s;ent, the neat profit, ari&s;ing to the king, from letting the pa&s;tures, is about 40,000 ducats; but with the duties in tallow, wool, &amp;c. this amounts to 400,000.</P>
<P>On account of the great variety of field &s;ports, to which the adjacent hills and plains are peculiarly adapted, this town was a favourite re&s;idence of the German princes. <HI>Charles</HI> I. of Spain, erected a &s;ump|tuous palace here, and died in this place, in his way to Brindi&s;i, in 1285. The Puglian &s;port&s;men run down hares with greyhounds, and pur&s;ue the wild boar, with one lurcher, and two or three ma&s;tiffs. The hunters ride with a lance, and a pair of pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>A few miles from Foggia are &s;ome faint traces of walls, &s;aid to be tho&s;e of Arpi, or Argyripae, once the capital of a kingdom, founded by <HI>Diomed,</HI> after the &s;iege of Troy. The flat pa&s;tures, about this place, and Manfredonia, for twenty miles, abound in a&s;pho|dels, thi&s;tles, wild artichokes, and fennel-grant; of the la&s;t are made bee-hives, and chair-bottoms. The leaves are given to a&s;&s;es, and the pea&s;ants eat the ten|der buds, when boiled, as a delicacy. This plant, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> who travelled over the &s;pot, covers half the plain, between Foggia and Manfredonia; and grows &s;o high, that there is an in&s;tance, in one
<PB N="358" REF="380">
of the wars, between France and Spain, of the Spa|niards having marched through it undi&s;covered, clo&s;e up to the French entrenchments. The artichokes are given to buffaloes.</P>
<P>Manfredonia is a city, built by <HI>Manfred,</HI> in 1261. In order to found it, under the mo&s;t favourable au&s;|pices, he called together the mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;ors of a&s;trology, a &s;cience he had great confidence in; and cau&s;ed them to calculate the happie&s;t hour and minute for laying the fir&s;t &s;tone. The port was &s;ecured from &s;torms by a pier; the ramparts were built of the mo&s;t &s;olid materials; and, in the great town, was hung a bell of &s;o con&s;iderable a volume, as to be heard over all the plain of Capitanata, to alarm the country in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion. In &s;pite, however, of all the pre|cautions taken by <HI>Manfred,</HI> neither his pains, or the horo&s;copes of his wizards, have been able to render it opulent or powerful. It carries on a direct trade in corn, with Venice and Greece, but has &s;carce &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants. It was pillaged by the Turks in 1620. All &s;orts of vegetables abound here, and are infinitely &s;uperior to tho&s;e rai&s;ed in the volcanic &s;oil of Naples; and fi&s;h is plentiful and cheap.</P>
<P>About twenty miles South of Manfredonia, on the coa&s;t, in the way to Brindi&s;i, are the fields of Cannae, famous for the victory obtained over the Romans by
<PB N="359" REF="381">
<HI>Hannibal,</HI> in the 536th year of Rome. The traces of the town are very faint, con&s;i&s;ting of fragments of altars, cornices, gates, walls, vaults, and under-ground granaries. It was de&s;troyed the year before the bat|tle. The &s;cene of action is marked out to po&s;terity, by the name of <HI>Pezzo di Sangue;</HI> "field of blood:" The pea&s;ants frequently turn up &s;purs, and heads of lances, with the plough; and hor&s;e loads of armour and weapons, have been, at different times, carried away. The bread of this place is as brown as ma|hogany, and quite gritty, owing to the incompact tex|ture of the &s;tone, with which the millers grind their corn. They beat out their corn here, by the tramp|ling of a great number of mares, tied in a &s;tring by their tails, and whipped round and round. In the <HI>Terra di Otranto,</HI> they do this by a pair of oxen, who drag between them a heavy rough &s;tone, that forces out the grain.</P>
<P>Barletti is another city on the coa&s;t, a little more to the South. It has a ruinous a&s;pect, its walls tumb|ling down, and its ditches filled with rubbi&s;h; but the city within, though thinly inhabited, is magnificently built. It conveys the idea of &s;ome mighty &s;tate, re|duced by conque&s;t to a province, or depopulated by pe&s;tilence. Its &s;treets are wide and well paved, the hou&s;es large and lofty, and built with hewn &s;tone; which, from age, has acquired a poli&s;h like marble.
<PB N="360" REF="382">
Some of the&s;e venerable man&s;ions have the &s;tones cut angularly, after the Tu&s;can manner. Many hou&s;es &s;till retain painted arches, &s;hort twi&s;ted columns, and other remnants of the ta&s;te of the Saracens, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have built them; whil&s;t others are deco|rated with all the embelli&s;hments of the old Grecian architecture. The cathedral is remarkable for its an|tique granite columns. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. was crowned here.</P>
<P>In the market-place &s;tands a bronze colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, &s;eventeen feet three inches high, &s;uppo&s;ed to repre|&s;ent the emperor <HI>Heraclius,</HI> who began his reign in 610. He is &s;tanding, dre&s;t in a military habit, crowned with a diadem, a &s;hort cloak hanging from his left &s;houlder, and thrown over his left arm, which holds a globe; his right arm is rai&s;ed above his head, and gra&s;ps a &s;mall cro&s;s. The image is rude and incor|rect, and the attitude awkward; <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it to have been cut in Italy, and dre&s;&s;ed after the Roman fa&s;hion. The citadel is &s;pacious, and commands the port, which is a labyrinth con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal irre|gular piers, where &s;hips are moored, but not &s;heltered from the North. The exports here, are &s;alt, corn, almonds, and liquorice, which la&s;t grows here &s;pon|taneou&s;ly in the &s;wamps.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="383">The next city &s;outhward is Trani, a &s;ea-port town al&s;o, and an archbi&s;hopric. There is, here, a colle|giate &s;eminary, but the &s;tudents &s;eem aver&s;e to &s;tudy. From time immemorial, no work is done in Trani after dinner, &s;o that the whole afternoon is &s;pent by the in|habitants in dozing, chattering, or &s;auntering. Though the exportation of corn from this place is con&s;iderable, it &s;eems the only bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tirring. Indu&s;try &s;eems to have for&s;aken the cities on this coa&s;t; there are too many of them; &s;o that, jealous of each other, they enfeeble their trade; and, being aver&s;e to all friendly intercour&s;e, never &s;tudy their intere&s;ts. All &s;orts of vegetables here are plentiful, and exqui&s;ite; the mar|ket-people &s;ell beans and peas by weight, and u&s;e peb|bles in lieu of weights.</P>
<P>Trani is tolerably well built with &s;tone, on uneven ground. The harbour is encircled by the town, and has &s;carcely depth of water enough to float a boat. The corn &s;hips anchor two miles from the &s;hore. The cathedral was erected &s;ix hundred years ago, and is a mean building. Here is al&s;o a ca&s;tle, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome gloomy towers; but the mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Clare</HI> is a &s;umptuous enclo&s;ure. If there was a good road on this coa&s;t, it would be delightful to travel it, with the Adriatic on one &s;ide, and olive groves on the other. There are other cities between Trani and Brindi&s;i, viz. Bi&s;ceglia, Molfetta, Giovenazzo, and
<PB N="362" REF="384">
Bari. As they have nothing remarkable, we &s;hall pa&s;s them and &s;peak of Bari.</P>
<P>Bari makes a great figure at a di&s;tance, it is de|fended by double walls, and an old ca&s;tle, occupying a rocky penin&s;ula, of a triangular form, about a mile in circumference. The hou&s;es are, in general, mean, but built on a &s;oil rai&s;ed by the ruins of former edi|fices, near thirty feet above the level of the &s;ea. From the rampart, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> at every turn of the eye, we catch a different view of the &s;ea and coa&s;t, &s;tretching from the mountains of Garganus, to the hills of O&s;tuni. The towns, that ri&s;e along this line in various de|grees of &s;hade, have a beautiful effect, and nothing can be more picture&s;que, than the fleets of fi&s;hing-boats, &s;teering for their re&s;pective harbours, on the approach of night. On &s;hore, the bloom of &s;pring, and lively foliage, contra&s;ted with innumerable white cottages, form an enchanting rural &s;cene.</P>
<P>This city is al&s;o an archbi&s;hopric. The cathedral has no exten&s;ive beauties, and its revenues do not ex|ceed 1,125l. Engli&s;h. Its &s;teeple is one of the highe&s;t in the kingdom, about 253 feet from the ground: among the trea&s;ures of this place, is an iron diadem, with which &s;ome Barian writers pretend the Norman kings were crowned. Religious orders abound in Bari, and &s;ome of them have rich gaudy churches,
<PB N="363" REF="385">
with good paintings. Here are twelve convents for men, five for women, and three ho&s;pitals. The in|habitants are about 16,700, are an active pains-taking &s;et of people, and carry on a good trade, in oil and almonds. They al&s;o export to the Venetian i&s;lands, a large quantity of pot-a&s;h, &s;oap, ani&s;eed and garlick.</P>
<P>Brindi&s;i was the ancient Brundu&s;ium, that gave birth to <HI>Pacuvius,</HI> and where <HI>Virgil</HI> died. In this city <HI>Octavianus</HI> fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Coe&s;ar;</HI> and here he concluded one of his &s;hort-lived peaces with <HI>Antony.</HI> The barbarians, who ravaged every corner of Italy, did not &s;pare &s;o rich a town; and, in 836, the Saracens gave a fini&s;hing blow to its fortunes. The phrenzy for expeditions to Pale&s;tine, (it being one of the ports where pilgrims and warriors took &s;hip|ping,) contributed powerfully to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of this city. It was al&s;o benefited by the re&s;idence of the emperor <HI>Frederick,</HI> who&s;e frequent armaments for the Holy Land, required his pre&s;ence at this place of rendezvous; but, the lo&s;s of Jeru&s;alem, the fall of the Grecian empire, and the ruin of all the Levant trade, after the Turks had conquered the Ea&s;t, re|duced Brindi&s;i to a &s;tate of inactivity and de&s;olation, from which it has never been able to emerge. The Appian way, pa&s;&s;ing Bari, terminated at Brundu|&s;ium.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="386">Brindi&s;i, as it now appears, is a great city, if the extent of its walls be con&s;idered; but the inhabited hou&s;es do not fill above half the enclo&s;ure. The &s;treets are crooked and rough, the buildings poor and ruinous; and it has no very remarkable church, or edifice. The canons of the cathedral retain the an|cient cu&s;tom of having hand-maids; but, as they take care to choo&s;e them, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> of canonical age and face, we may &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>focarioe,</HI> to be only cha&s;te repre&s;entatives of the help-mates allowed the clergy, before popes and councils had reprobated them. The&s;e women are exempt from taxes, and enjoy many privileges. When they die, they are buried gratis, and the funeral is attended by the chap|ter, with great &s;olemnity; a mark of re&s;pect not paid to any relations of the canons.</P>
<P>Near the port, &s;tand the walls of a palace, erected by <HI>Walter de Brienne,</HI> in a very bad ta&s;te. Its ma|terials are grey &s;tone, divided at regular di&s;tances, with broad cour&s;es of black marble. Little remains of ancient Brundu&s;ium, except innumerable broken pillars, fixed at the corners of &s;treets, to defend the hou&s;es from carts; fragments of coar&s;e mo&s;aic work, the floors of former habitations, the column of the light-hou&s;e, a large marble ba&s;on, into which the water runs from brazen heads of deer, &s;ome in&s;crip|tions, ruins of aqueducts, coins, and other &s;mall fur|niture
<PB N="365" REF="387">
of an antiquary's cabinet. The ca&s;tle, built to protect the Northern branch of the harbour, is large and &s;tately.</P>
<P>The port is double, and the fine&s;t in the Adriatic. The outer part is formed by two promontories, that &s;tretch off gradually from each other, as they advance into the &s;ea; leaving a very narrow channel at the ba&s;e of the angle. The i&s;land of St. Andrew, on which is a fortre&s;s, lies out between the capes, and &s;ecures the whole road from the fury of the waves. In this deep pit, or &s;pace, large &s;hips may ride at anchor. At the bottom of the bay the hills recede, in a &s;emicircular &s;hape, to leave room for the inner haven, which, as it were, cla&s;ps the city in its arms; or rather encircles it in the figure of a &s;tag's head and horns. This form is &s;aid to have given ri&s;e to its name Brundu&s;ium; in the old Me&s;&s;apian language &s;ignifying a deer's head. Nothing can be more beau|tiful than this interior port, or better adapted to trade and navigation. It is very deep, and extends in length two miles and a half; in breadth, 1200 feet in the wide&s;t part. The hills, and the town, &s;helter it on all &s;ides. The north ridge is plentifully cultivated and planted; but, that to the South is bare of wood, and all &s;own with corn. In ancient days, the com|munication between the two havens, was marked by lights, placed on Corinthian columns. Of the&s;e, one
<PB N="366" REF="388">
remains entire on its pede&s;tal, is built with a green and white marble, its capital adorned with figures of Syrens and Tritons, mixed with the Acanthus leaf, and upon it is a circular va&s;e, which formerly held the fire. The whole kingdom of Naples cannot &s;hew a more complete &s;ituation for trade; and yet it has nei|ther commerce, hu&s;bandry, nor is it populous. From the ob&s;tructions in the channel of communication, between the outer and inner haven, ari&s;es the tribe of evils that de&s;olate this unhappy town. <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar</HI> may be &s;aid to have begun its ruin, by attempting to block up <HI>Pompey</HI>'s fleet. He drove piles into the neck of land, between the two ridges of hills; threw in earth, trees, and ruins of hou&s;es, and had nearly accompli&s;hed the blockade, when <HI>Pompey</HI> &s;ailed out, and e&s;caped to Greece.

<P><PB N="367" REF="390">In the fifteenth century, the prince of <HI>Tarento</HI> &s;unk &s;ome &s;hips in the middle of the pa&s;&s;age, to prevent the royali&s;ts from entering the port, which became a re&s;t|ing-place for &s;ea-weeds and &s;and, and thus blocked up the pa&s;&s;age. In 1752, the evil was increa&s;ed, &s;o as to prevent the waves beating through; and, from this period, the port became a fetid green lake; no fi&s;h but eels could live in it, nor any boat ply, except canoes of a &s;ingle tree. The low grounds at each end were overflowed, and converted into mar&s;hes; which every &s;ummer created &s;uch a pe&s;tilence, as in a few years &s;wept off the greate&s;t part of its inhabitants. From the number of eighteen thou&s;and, they were re|duced in 1766, to five thou&s;and livid wretches, tor|mented with agues and malignant fevers. In 1775, fifteen hundred died during the autumn. Well may <HI>Swinburne</HI> call this a woeful change of climate. Forty years ago, the air of Brindi&s;i was e&s;teemed &s;o whole&s;ome, that the convents of Naples u&s;ed to &s;end their con&s;umptive friars here, for the recovery of their health. This induced the remaining citizens to apply for relief, to one of the kings, <HI>Marce&s;tus,</HI> who was a native of the place, and the port has been re-opened in con&s;equence. It will now admit large boats; the &s;ea ru&s;hes in and out at all tides; and the canal, which is &s;even hundred yards long, in a direct line from the column, is cleared; its parapets de|fended by piles and fa&s;cines; and it is in contempla|tion

to erect &s;tone piers on each &s;ide. Sir <HI>Wil|liam Hamilton</HI> &s;ays, in 1789, the canal is now &s;o choaked up, as to have only &s;even feet in depth of of water, in many places, and the pe&s;tilential air is as prevalent as ever. The engineer who undertook to clear it failed; but another is appointed, who means to widen the canal to &s;ixty-&s;even feet, and make it twenty-one feet deep; but there is every rea&s;on to fear, &s;ays Sir <HI>William,</HI> that the propo&s;ed remedy will prove ineffectual, and that this unfortunate city is doomed to &s;peedy de&s;truction. The workmen, in clearing the channel, have found &s;ome medals and &s;eals, and have drawn up many piles, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> that were driven in by <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar.</HI> They are &s;mall oaks, &s;tripped of their bark, and &s;till are as fre&s;h as if they had been cut only a month; though buried, above eighteen centuries, &s;even feet under the &s;and. The &s;oil about the town is light and good, produces ex|cellent cotton, which is manufactured into gloves and &s;tockings at Brindi&s;i.</P>

<P>THE next city, of any note, is Lecce; this lies between the North latitudes of 40 and 41 in the penin&s;ula, called the heel of Italy; the breadth of which is about thirty miles. Lecce is on the Ea&s;|tern coa&s;t, Gallipoli on the We&s;tern. The country here is open, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome coppices of &s;mall, jagged leaved oaks; the fields decorated with loo&s;e &s;tone walks. The Adriatic &s;ea, here, is not more than &s;ixty miles over; the &s;nowy tops, of the Grecian mountains, are, in a clear day, vi&s;ible. The villages, in this penin&s;ula, make a very plea&s;ing appearance, the hou&s;es being built with white &s;tone; but the churches are ornamented in a very barbarous &s;tyle, and the face of the country is too rocky, and too bare of trees, corn, and gra&s;s, to be agreeable.</P>
<P>Lecce, the capital of Terra di Otranto, the &s;eat of its tribunal, and the &s;econd city in the kingdom, is
<PB N="370" REF="393">
better paved and built, than any town in this pro|vince. If the builders here had the &s;malle&s;t ta&s;te, the buildings would make a noble figure; for the &s;tone of the country is &s;o fine, white, and &s;oft, when taken from the quarry, that it may be moulded like wax, and will receive any form from the chi&s;el; yet, when expo&s;ed to the air, becomes hard and durable; but the architecture here, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> is cramped into &s;uch crowded, uncouth decorations, as to be far in|ferior to that of the Goths and Saracens. Many of the paintings in the churches, and hou&s;es of the no|bility, are by <HI>Verrio,</HI> a native of Lecce, long em|ployed in England; he died in 1707. The number of people here does not exceed thirteen thou&s;and; very inadequate to the extent of the city, which has the reputation of being, to the kingdom of Naples, what Thebes was to Greece; and a native of Lecce, is &s;aid to be di&s;tingui&s;hable from his fellow-&s;ubjects, by his heavy manner, and dull comprehen&s;ion. It has, notwith&s;tanding, an academy of Belles Lettres. Lecce is twenty-four miles from Brindi&s;i, and is a bi&s;hoprick. Mu&s;ic is here cultivated with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and many of the nobility are good per|formers, and proud of exhibiting on &s;olemn fe&s;tivals. Leccean mu&s;ic has a very plaintive character, peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="394">Otranto is a &s;mall city, &s;tands on a hill, and con|tains only three thou&s;and inhabitants. Its harbour &s;mall, but convenient. The cathedral is Gothic, and, agreeable to the mode in Puglia, has a &s;ubterranean &s;anctuary. The columns are of beautiful marble, and granite; the pavement, a rude &s;pecies of Mo&s;aic, called Saracenic, like the tomb of <HI>Edward</HI> I. in We&s;t|min&s;ter-abbey. The&s;e mo&s;aics are compo&s;ed of pieces of porphyry, &s;erpentine and cubes of gilt gla&s;s, di&s;|po&s;ed in &s;tars, coiles, or chequers. The compart|ments of the halls are bordered with them; and the &s;mall twi&s;ted columns, that &s;upport the pulpits and ca|nopies, are ornamented with a &s;piral &s;hape of the &s;ame work.</P>
<P>Otranto was a Roman colony, and is an arch|bi&s;hop's &s;ee. It was invaded by the Turks in 1480, inve&s;ted, &s;tormed, and pillaged; its prelate was &s;lain at the church door; eight hundred principal inhabi|tants dragged out of the gates and butchered, and their bodies left unburied for twelve months. <HI>Swin|burne</HI> &s;ays, he was entertained here with the mu&s;ic of &s;ome of tho&s;e itinerant performers, that play at Chri&s;t|mas, in the &s;treets of Rome and Naples. Their na|tive country is Ba&s;ilicata, where the inhabitants of the Apennines learn, from their infancy, to rai&s;e the mat|tock with one hand, and play on the bagpipe, or flagelet, with the other. With the&s;e people, mu&s;ic
<PB N="372" REF="395">
is rather a talent awakened by nece&s;&s;ity, than an act of pa&s;time or luxury. Their u&s;ual employment is draining of lands; but as &s;uch work is not always needful, they travel with their mu&s;ical in&s;truments for a maintenance, all over Italy, France, and Spain. Some have gone as far as America, and brought back much wealth with them. Their concerts are gene|rally compo&s;ed of two mu&s;icians, who play in uni&s;on, with two long large bagpipes, one an octave higher than the other; whil&s;t a third &s;ounds a kind of hautboy; and, at the end of each ritornel, chants a rural ditty, to which the bagpipes play an accompa|niment. The in&s;truments are all made by the &s;hep|herds them&s;elves, in tho&s;e forms and &s;izes, which tra|dition has handed down to them, and experience has taught them to imitate.</P>
<P>Being in the country of the tarantula, Mr. <HI>Swin|burne</HI> took &s;ome pains to inve&s;tigate every particular re&s;pecting that in&s;ect; but could find no per&s;on bitten with it, the &s;ea&s;on of the year not being far enough advanced. He, however, prevailed on a woman, who had formerly been bitten, to act the part, and dance before him. Many mu&s;icians were &s;ummoned, and &s;he performed it, as they all declared, to per|fection. At fir&s;t, &s;he lolled &s;tupidly on a chair, whil&s;t the &s;trains were dull; but, when the men touched the chord, &s;uppo&s;ed to vibrate to her heart, &s;he
<PB N="373" REF="396">
&s;prang up with a hedious yell, &s;taggered round the room like a per&s;on drunk, holding a handkerchief in both hands, rai&s;ing them alternately, and moving in very true time. As the mu&s;ic grew bri&s;ker, her motions quickened, and &s;he &s;kipped about with great vigour, and variety of &s;teps, every now and then &s;hrieking very loud. Wherever a per&s;on bit is to dance, a place is prepared for them, hung round with ribbands, and bunches of grapes. The patients are dre&s;&s;ed in white, with red, green, and yellow rib|bands, the&s;e being the favourite colours; on their &s;houlders they ca&s;t a white &s;carf, let their hair fall loo&s;e about their ears, and throw their heads as far back as they can bear it. They are exact copies of the ancient prie&s;te&s;&s;es of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The orgies of that god, who&s;e wor&s;hip under various &s;ymbols was more widely &s;pread over the globe, than that of any other divinity, were doubtle&s;s performed with energy and enthu&s;ia&s;m, by the lively inhabitants of this warm climate. The introduction of Chri&s;tianity having aboli&s;hed all the&s;e heatheni&s;h rites, and the women not daring to act any frantic part, as bacchantes, <HI>Swinburne</HI> is of opinion, that, unwilling to give up &s;o darling an amu&s;ement, they devi&s;ed other pretences. Accident may have led them to the di&s;covery of the tarantula; and, on the &s;trength of its poi&s;on, the Pug|lian dames &s;till enjoy their old dance, though time has effaced the memory of its ancient name and in&s;ti|tution.
<PB N="374" REF="397">
It has been proved that the tarantula is a harmle&s;s in&s;ect, and the in&s;anity, &s;aid to be occa|&s;ioned by its bite, and cured by mu&s;ic, is an impo|&s;ition only on the credulous. It is a large &s;pider with eight eyes, placed four, two, and two.</P>
<P>Gallipoli lies on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore of the penin|&s;ula, about thirty miles from Otranto, in the gulph of Tarento. It &s;tands on a rocky i&s;land, joined to the continent by a bridge, near which flows a foun|tain of very fine water. From the remote&s;t antiquity, this &s;tation was &s;o very favourable to commerce, that every maritime power wi&s;hed to &s;ecure it; but, the crown of Naples has &s;o de&s;erted it, that it has neither harbour, nor &s;helter for &s;hipping. Its inhabitants do not exceed &s;ix thou&s;and; but they are ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, lively, merry, and, in general, well in|formed. The air is rather con&s;umptive. The build|ings are tolerable, and &s;ome of the churches have good paintings. Good mu&s;lins, cotton &s;tockings, and other parts of apparel are here manufactured, and pur|cha&s;ed by the Provencals. The cotton trade brings in about thirty thou&s;and ducats yearly. Their wine is good, but oil is the great &s;upport of the place. Two-thirds of all olive plantations are exported to France and the north of Italy; the remainder is &s;ent to Naples, and other Italian ports. In 1766, oil was exported to the value of one million of ducats.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="398">The olive tree is, here, attended with the greate&s;t care. The fruit is not gathered, but kept till it falls. The common method, of making oil, is to cru&s;h the olives to a pa&s;te, with a perpendicular mill&s;tone, run|ning round a trough. This pa&s;te is put into flat, round, ru&s;h ba&s;kets, piled one upon another, and then put under a pre&s;s. After the fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ing, &s;cald|ing water is poured into each ba&s;ket, its contents &s;tirred up, and they are again pre&s;&s;ed; and &s;o re|peatedly, till no more oil can be &s;kimmed from the &s;urface.</P>
<P>Tarento is the next city we &s;hall mention, and &s;hall dwell rather longer upon this, as affording more entertainment to our readers. It is nearly in the &s;ame latitude with Brindi&s;i, only on the We&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, about thirty miles from Brin|di&s;i. It is a &s;eaport, at the upper end of the gulph of Tarento; and admits of reflections on the general vici&s;&s;itudes of the fate of empires. Tarento, where now &s;carce a &s;ingle fi&s;hing boat di&s;turbs the bo&s;om of its waters, is that where the trading ve&s;&s;els of half the world once rendezvou&s;ed; where the mighty navy of Carthage once di&s;played its flag. Of all the tem|ples, gymna&s;ia, theatres, and other monuments of glory and opulence, not &s;o much as a &s;ingle column ri&s;es on the hill where Tarentum once &s;tood; which is on the left in the plate of the pre&s;ent town; the
<PB N="376" REF="399">
paltry buildings, of &s;ome mean convents, mark its ancient &s;cite; whil&s;t the modern city, crowded into a narrow i&s;land, holds the place of the old citadel, and &s;till re&s;embles a fortre&s;s, more than an emporium of trade; but, in &s;pite of all this change, Tarento is &s;till replete with wonderful beauties.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent city &s;tands upon a neck of land, di|vided from the oppo&s;ite country by the &s;ea of Pic|colo, which runs from the gulph of Tarento by a narrow &s;treight, &s;ix miles up into the country, form|ing a large oval lake, three miles wide, divided into two bays by a narrow promontory. Tarento is joined to the oppo&s;ite land by a bridge of &s;even arches. Through the&s;e the tide flows with great im|petuo&s;ity, and nothing now but &s;mall boats can be ad|mitted, which, before the building of the bridge, was the entrance of the harbour. On this bridge is carried the aqueduct, that &s;upplies the city with water from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. This bay, and the city, is a delightful &s;cene. Olive woods clothe the fine ground on both &s;ides, and the oppo&s;ite hills are rich in corn-fields and orchards. Over the city, and beyond the bridge, &s;hips appear at anchor in the gulph, or outer port, and the blue mountains of Ba&s;ilcata on the right, complete the pro&s;pect. (See the plate.)</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="401">The city of Tarento has not much to boa&s;t of. The &s;treets are remarkably dirty, and narrow; particularly the Marina, which runs along the Mare Piccolo; and is, without di&s;pute, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful habitation of human beings in Europe; except, perhaps, the Je&s;uits Ghetto at Rome. The only tolerable &s;treet is a ter|race, above the &s;teep rocks that hang over the gulph, or great &s;ea, and prevent all acce&s;s on that quarter. The cathedral has but little merit. The &s;quare, near the bridge, is the only opening of any extent, and the general re&s;ort of the citizens in &s;ummer, when they &s;it round the fountain, to enjoy the &s;oft evening breeze, and refre&s;h them&s;elves with the fanning of the balmy air. In the hot &s;ummer months, the air is not very whole&s;ome; but, the archbi&s;hop is &s;tudying every means to improve the place by cultivation, and other means. <HI>Swinburne</HI> was well entertained here. At the priory, he had, for &s;upper, fifteen different &s;orts of &s;hell-fi&s;h, all fat and &s;avory; particularly a &s;mall mu&s;|cle, tinged both within and without with the riche&s;t violet colour, and the &s;hell covered with &s;hag. This mu&s;cle is dragged for in the great &s;ea, and then &s;cat|tered on heaps of &s;tones, &s;unk by the fi&s;hermen, at every head-land of the Mare Piccolo.</P>
<P>Brundu&s;ium was the great &s;upply of oy&s;ters for the Roman tables. From that port, the &s;pawn was car|ried to &s;tock their public re&s;ervoirs at the Lucrine
<PB N="378" REF="402">
lake, near Baia; and no mention is made, by the an|cients, of any Tarentine &s;hellfi&s;h, except the &s;callop; but they have now ninety-three different &s;orts, all eat|able; and oy&s;ters among the re&s;t. Very fine branch|ing coral is al&s;o found, along the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of this city; the places are kept a &s;ecret. The quantity may be judged of by a boat's crew, once drawing up, in one day, as much as &s;old for ninety-three pounds fif|teen &s;hillings Engli&s;h, that is five hundred ducats, each ducat three &s;hillings and nine-pence &s;terling.</P>
<P>The &s;eas of Tarento are as copiou&s;ly &s;tocked with the &s;caly and finny tribes, as with the cru&s;taceous and te&s;taceous. The people depend on their fi&s;hery for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pay very heavy duties to the crown, and rents to private per&s;ons. The King receives 1700l. a-year for rent.</P>
<P>Never was a place more completely &s;wept off the face of the earth than Tarentum, not a &s;ingle ruin left; &s;carce a mark, that &s;uch a city ever exi&s;ted on the &s;pot; and yet we are well a&s;&s;ured by hi&s;torians, that a rival of Rome, once rai&s;ed her proud towers, and arrayed her numerous armies along the&s;e now lone|&s;ome hills. Near the Alcantarine convent is a &s;mall hillock, wholly formed of the &s;hells of fi&s;h, employed by the ancients in the compo&s;ition of their celebrated purple dye; and, not far from it, are the remains of
<PB N="379" REF="403">
&s;ome re&s;ervoirs and conduits belonging to their work. Below the ruins of the&s;e re&s;ervoirs, the &s;hore is thickly &s;trewed with fragments of Etru&s;can va&s;es; and a little nearer the city is the Argentaria, where the gold and &s;ilver&s;miths had their &s;hops. It &s;till de&s;erves the name, from a number of medals, rings, chains, and other trinkets, con&s;tantly dug out of it.</P>
<P>The cotton manufacture employs the&s;e poor Ta|rentines, who are not able to be fi&s;hermen. The pay of a hu&s;bandman is a carline (fourpence halfpenny) a day. Cultivation goes on well; in &s;ome places the crops are divided between the landlord and the farmer: but the quantity of wa&s;te lands is incredible; and whatever pains they be&s;tow on corn-lands, no one has an idea of improving either pa&s;ture or meadow. Not a &s;eed is &s;own, not a weed de&s;troyed, not a bu&s;h grub|bed up.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention the greate&s;t curio&s;ity, in this part of the world; which is a well, mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> in his &s;econd book. <HI>Juxta oppidum Manduriam lacus ad margines plenus, neque exhau&s;tis aquis minuitur, neque enfu&s;is augetur.</HI> "Near the town of Manduria, is a lake full to the brim, who&s;e waters never dimini&s;h, nor increa&s;e by addition." This well <HI>Swinburne</HI> ex|amined: it excites the admiration of the people as much now, as it did in ancient days. The water, in
<PB N="380" REF="404">
this circular cavern, lighted from above by a &s;pacious aperture, never ri&s;es or falls beyond a certain mark. If as much rubbi&s;h be thrown in, as will fill it half-way up, it never ri&s;es the water above the mark; if the rubbi&s;h ri&s;es above the mark, the water di&s;appears. Clear away the mud to the bottom, and you find a hard &s;mooth floor, without any &s;igns of a cha&s;m for the water to run off. The water is good and &s;upplies the town; of cour&s;e, all experiments on it are for|bidden.</P>
<P>Every baron in this country keeps a certain num|ber of tru&s;ty, determined fellows, to protect his va&s;&s;als, convey his rents, and prevent depredations on his game and fore&s;ts. They howl by the &s;ide of his coach, to defend his per&s;on and baggage. The rad|knights, or radmen, kept by ancient barons, were of the &s;ame kind.</P>
