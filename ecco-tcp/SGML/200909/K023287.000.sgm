<HEAD>TO <HI>M. DE LA FAYETTE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER an acquaintance of nearly fifteen years, in difficult &s;ituations in America, and various con&s;ultations in Europe, I feel a plea&s;ure in pre|&s;enting to you this &s;mall treati&s;e, in gratitude for your &s;ervices to my beloved America, and as a te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for the virtues, public and private, which I know you to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The only point upon which I could ever di&s;cover that we differed, was not as to principles of go|vernment, but as to time. For my own part, I think it equally as injurious to good principles to permit them to linger, as to pu&s;h them on too fa&s;t. That which you &s;uppo&s;e accompli&s;hable in fourteen or fifteen years, I may believe practicable in a much &s;horter period. Mankind, as it appears to me, are always ripe enough to under&s;tand their true intere&s;t, provided it be pre&s;ented clearly to their under&s;tanding, and that in a manner not to create &s;u&s;picion by any thing like &s;elf-de&s;ign, nor offend by a&s;&s;uming too much. Where we would wi&s;h to reform we mu&s;t not reproach.</P>
<P>When the American revolution was e&s;tabli&s;hed, I felt a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;it &s;erenely down and enjoy
<PB N="vi" REF="3"> the calm. It did not appear to me that any ob|ject could afterwards ari&s;e great enough to make me quit tranquillity, and feel as I had felt before. But when principle, and not place, is the energetic cau&s;e of action, a man, I find, is every where the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I am now once more in the public world; and as I have not a right to contemplate on &s;o many years of remaining life as you have, I am re|&s;olved to labour as fa&s;t as I can; and as I am anxious for your aid and your company, I wi&s;h you to ha&s;ten your principles, and overtake me.</P>
<P>If you make a campaign the en&s;uing &s;pring, which it is mo&s;t probable there will be no occa&s;ion for, I will come and join you. Should the cam|paign commence, I hope it will terminate in the extinction of German de&s;poti&s;m, and in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the freedom of all Germany. When France &s;hall be &s;urrounded with revolutions, &s;he will be in peace and &s;afety, and her taxes, as well as tho&s;e of Germany, will con&s;equently become le&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I began the chapter entitled the <HI>"Conclu&s;ion"</HI> in the former part of the RIGHTS OF MAN, publi&s;hed la&s;t year, it was my intention to have extended it to a greater length; but in ca&s;ting the whole matter in my mind which I wi&s;hed to add, I found that I mu&s;t either make the work too bulky, or contract my plan too much. I therefore brought it to a clo&s;e as &s;oon as the &s;ubject would admit, and re|&s;erved what I had further to &s;ay to another op|portunity.</P>
<P>Several other rea&s;ons contributed to produce this determination. I wi&s;hed to know the manner in which a work, written in a &s;tyle of thinking and expre&s;&s;ion different to what had been cu&s;to|mary in England, would be received before I pro|ceeded farther. A great field was opening to the view of mankind by means of the French Revo|lution. Mr. Burke's outrageous oppo&s;ition there|to brought the controver&s;y into England. He at|tacked principles which he knew (from informa|tion) I would conte&s;t with him, becau&s;e they are principles I believe to be good, and which I have contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h, and conceive my&s;elf bound to defend. Had he not urged the controver&s;y, I had mo&s;t probably been a &s;ilent man.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5">Another rea&s;on for deferring the remainder of the work was, that Mr. Burke promi&s;ed in his fir&s;t publication to renew the &s;ubject at another oppor|tunity, and to make a compari&s;on of what he called the Engli&s;h and French Con&s;titutions. I therefore held my&s;elf in re&s;erve for him. He has publi&s;hed two works &s;ince, without doing this; which he certainly would not have omitted, had the com|pari&s;on been in his favour.</P>
<P>In his la&s;t work, <Q>His appeal from the new to the old Whigs,</Q> he has quoted about ten pages from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and having given him&s;elf the trouble of doing this, &s;ays, <Q>he &s;hall not at|tempt in the &s;malle&s;t degree to refute them,</Q> meaning the principles therein contained. I am enough acquainted with Mr. Burke to know, that he would if he could. But in&s;tead of conte&s;ting them, he immediately after con&s;oles him&s;elf with &s;aying, that "he has done his part."&mdash;He has not done his part. He has not performed his promi&s;e of a compari&s;on of con&s;titutions. He &s;tarted the controver&s;y, he gave the challenge, and has fled from it; and he is now a <HI>ca&s;e in point</HI> with his own opinion, that, <HI>"the age of chivalry is gone!"</HI></P>
<P>The title, as well as the &s;ub&s;tance of his la&s;t work, his <HI>"Appeal,"</HI> is his condemnation. Prin|ciples mu&s;t &s;tand on their own merits, and if they are good they certainly will. To put them under the &s;helter of other men's authority, as Mr. Burke has done, &s;erves to bring them into &s;u&s;picion. Mr. Burke is not very fond of dividing his honours, but in this ca&s;e he is artfully dividing the di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="6">But who are tho&s;e to whom Mr. Burke has made his appeal? A &s;et of childi&s;h thinkers and half-way politicians born in the la&s;t century; men who went no farther with any principle than as it &s;uited their purpo&s;e as a party; the nation was al|ways left out of the que&s;tion; and this has been the character of every party from that day to this. The nation &s;ees nothing in &s;uch works, or &s;uch politics worthy its attention. A little matter will move a party, but it mu&s;t be &s;omething great that moves a nation.</P>
<P>Though I &s;ee nothing in Mr. Burke's Appeal worth taking much notice of, there is, however, one expre&s;&s;ion upon which I &s;hall offer a few re|marks.&mdash;After quoting largely from the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and declining to conte&s;t the principles con|tained in that work, he &s;ays, <Q>This will mo&s;t probably be done <HI>(if &s;uch writings &s;hall be thought to de&s;erve any other refutation than that of criminal ju&s;tice)</HI> by others, who may think with Mr. Burke and with the &s;ame zeal.</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it has not yet been done by any body. Not le&s;s, I believe, than eight or ten pam|phlets intended as an&s;wers to the former part of the "Rights of Man" have been publi&s;hed by different per&s;ons, and not one of them, to my knowledge, has extended to a &s;econd edition, nor are even the titles of them &s;o much as generally remembered. As I am aver&s;e to unnece&s;&s;arily multiplying publications, I have an&s;wered none of them. And as I believe that a man may write
<PB N="x" REF="7"> him&s;elf out of reputation when nobody el&s;e can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock.</P>
<P>But as I would decline unnece&s;&s;ary publications on the one hand, &s;o would I avoid every thing that might appear like &s;ullen pride on the other. If Mr. Burke, or any per&s;on on his &s;ide the que&s;tion, will produce an an&s;wer to the "Rights of Man," that &s;hall extend to an half, or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended, I will reply to his work. But until this be done, I &s;hall &s;o far take the &s;en&s;e of the public for my guide (and the world knows I am not a flat|terer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not worth mine to an&s;wer. I &s;uppo&s;e the number of copies to which the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> extended, taking England, Scot|land, and Ireland, is not le&s;s than between forty and fifty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I now come to remark on the remaining part of the quotation I have made from Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>"If," &s;ays he, <Q>&s;uch writings &s;hall be thought to de&s;erve any other refutation than that of <HI>cri|minal</HI> ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>Pardoning the pun, it mu&s;t be <HI>criminal</HI> ju&s;tice indeed that &s;hould condemn a work as a &s;ub&s;titute for not being able to refute it. The greate&s;t con|demnation that could be pa&s;&s;ed upon it would be a refutation. But in proceeding by the method Mr. Burke alludes to, the condemnation would, in the final event, pa&s;s upon the criminality of the pro|ce&s;s and not upon the work, and in this ca&s;e, I
<PB N="xi" REF="8"> had rather be the author, than be either the judge, or the jury, that &s;hould condemn it.</P>
<P>But to come at once to the point. I have dif|fered from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen on the &s;ub|ject of pro&s;ecutions, and I &s;ince find they are fall|ing into my opinion, which I will here &s;tate as fully, but as conci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t put a ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>It would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit inve&s;tigating the principles, good or bad, on which &s;uch a law, or any other is founded.</P>
<P>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors, to rea&s;on on its defects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it al&s;o my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e at the &s;ame time of every argument to &s;hew its er|rors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; becau&s;e the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to a di&s;cre|tionary violation, of tho&s;e which are good.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to principles and forms of government, or to what are called con&s;titutions and the parts of which they are com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9">It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular indi|viduals, that government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that mankind are at the expence of &s;upporting it. The defects of every government and con&s;ti|tution, both as to principle and form mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When tho&s;e defects, and the means of remedying them are ge|nerally &s;een by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other. The operation of government is re&s;tricted to the making and the admini&s;tering of laws; but it is to a nation that the right of forming or re|forming, generating or regenerating con&s;titutions and governments belong; and con&s;equently tho&s;e &s;ubjects, as &s;ubjects of inve&s;tigation, are always before a country <HI>as a matter of right,</HI> and cannot, without invading the general rights of that country, be made &s;ubjects for pro&s;ecution. On this ground I will meet Mr. Burke whenever he plea&s;e. It is better that the whole argument &s;hould come out, than to &s;eek to &s;tifle it. It was him&s;elf that open|ed the controver&s;y, and he ought not to de&s;ert it.</P>
<P>I do not believe that monarchy and ari&s;tocracy will continue &s;even years longer in any of the en|lightened countries in Europe. If better rea&s;ons can be &s;hewn for them than again&s;t them, they will &s;tand; if the contrary, they will not. Mankind
<PB N="xiii" REF="10"> are not now to be told they &s;hall not think, or they &s;hall not read; and publications that go no farther than to inve&s;tigate principles of government, to in|vite men to rea&s;on and to reflect, and to &s;hew the errors and excellences of different &s;y&s;tems, have a right to appear. If they do not excite attention, they are not worth the trouble of a pro&s;ecution; and if they do, the pro&s;ecution will amount to no|thing, &s;ince it cannot amount to a prohibition of reading. This would be a &s;entence on the public, in&s;tead of the author, and would al&s;o be the mo&s;t effectual mode of making or ha&s;tening revo|lutions.</P>
<P>On all ca&s;es that apply univer&s;ally to a nation, with re&s;pect to &s;y&s;tems of government, a jury of <HI>twelve</HI> men is not competent to decide. Where there are no witne&s;&s;es to be examined, no facts to be proved, and where the whole matter is before the whole public, and the merits or demerits of it re&s;ting on their opinion; and where there is no|thing to be known in a court, but what every body knows out of it, every twelve men is equally as good a jury as the other, and would mo&s;t probably re|ver&s;e each other's verdict; or from the variety of their opinions, not be able to form one. It is one ca&s;e, whether a nation approve a work, or a plan; but it is quite another ca&s;e, whether it will commit to any &s;uch jury the power of determining whether that nation have a right to, or &s;hall reform its govern|ment, or not. I mention tho&s;e ca&s;es, that Mr. Burke may &s;ee I have not written on Government
<PB N="xiv" REF="11"> without reflecting on what is Law, as well as on what are Rights.&mdash;The only effectual jury in &s;uch ca&s;es would be, a convention of the whole nation fairly elected; for in all &s;uch ca&s;es the whole nation is the vicinage. If Mr. Burke will propo&s;e &s;uch a jury, I will wave all privileges of being the citizen of another country, and, defending its principles, abide the i&s;&s;ue, provided he will do the &s;ame; for my opinion is, that his work and his principles would be condemned in&s;tead of mine.</P>
<P>As to the prejudices which men have from edu|cation and habit, in favour of any particular form or &s;y&s;tem of government, tho&s;e prejudices have yet to &s;tand the te&s;t of rea&s;on and reflection. In fact, &s;uch prejudices are nothing. No man is preju|diced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is attached to it on the belief of its being right; and when he &s;ee it is not &s;o, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a defective idea of what pre|judice is. It might be &s;aid, that until men think for them&s;elves the whole is prejudice, and <HI>not opi|nion;</HI> for that only is opinion which is the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and reflection. I offer this remark, that Mr. Burke may not confide too much in what has been the cu&s;tomary prejudices of the country.</P>
<P>I do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by. They have been impo&s;ed upon by parties, and by men a&s;&s;uming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation &s;hould ri&s;e above tho&s;e trifles. It is time to di&s;mi&s;s that inattention which has &s;o long
<PB N="xv" REF="12"> been the encouraging cau&s;e of &s;tretching tax|ation to exce&s;s. It is time to di&s;mi&s;s all tho&s;e &s;ongs and toa&s;ts which are calculated to en&s;lave, and operate to &s;uffocate reflection. On all &s;uch &s;ubjects men have but to think, and they will nei|ther act wrong nor be mi&s;led. To &s;ay that any people are not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and to &s;ay they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If &s;uch a ca&s;e could be proved, it would equally prove, that tho&s;e who govern are not fit to govern them, for they are a part of the &s;ame national ma&s;s.</P>
<P>But admitting governments to be changed all over Europe; it certainly may be done without convul&s;ion or revenge. It is not worth making changes or revolutions, unle&s;s it be for &s;ome great national benefit; and when this &s;hall appear to a nation, the danger will be, as in America and France, to tho&s;e who oppo&s;e; and with this re|flection I clo&s;e my Preface.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT Archimedes &s;aid of the mechanical powers, may be applied to Rea&s;on and Liberty: <HI>"Had we,"</HI> &s;aid he, <Q>a place to &s;tand upon, we might rai&s;e the world.</Q></P>
<P>The revolution of America pre&s;ented in politics what was only theory in mechanics. So deeply rooted were all the governments of the old world, and &s;o effectually had the tyranny and the antiquity of habit e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf over the mind, that no beginning could be made in A&s;ia, Africa, or Europe, to reform the political condition of man. Freedom had been hunted round the globe; rea|&s;on was con&s;idered as rebellion; and the &s;lavery of fear had made men afraid to think.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the irre&s;i&s;tible nature of truth, that all it a&s;ks, and all it wants, is the liberty of appearing. The &s;un needs no in&s;cription to di&s;tingui&s;h him from darkne&s;s; and no &s;ooner did the American go|vernments di&s;play them&s;elves to the world, than
<PB N="2" REF="15"> de&s;poti&s;m felt a &s;hock, and man began to con|template redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The independence of America, con&s;idered mere|ly as a &s;eparation from England, would have been a matter but of little importance, had it not been accompanied by a revolution in the principles and practice of governments. She made a &s;tand, not for her&s;elf only, but for the world, and looked beyond the advantages her&s;elf could receive. Even the He&s;&s;ian, though hired to fight again&s;t her, may live to ble&s;s his defeat; and England, con|demning the viciou&s;ne&s;s of its government, rejoice in its mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>As America was the only &s;pot in the political world, where the principles of univer&s;al reforma|tion could begin, &s;o al&s;o was it the be&s;t in the natural world. An a&s;&s;emblage of circum&s;tances con&s;pired, not only to give birth, but to add gigantic maturity to its principles. The &s;cene which that country pre&s;ents to the eye of a &s;pec|tator, has &s;omething in it which generates and encourages great ideas. Nature appears to him in magnitude. The mighty objects he beholds, act upon his mind by enlarging it, and he par|takes of the greatne&s;s he contemplates.&mdash;Its fir&s;t &s;ettlers were emigrants from different European nations, and of diver&s;ified profe&s;&s;ions of religion, retiring from the governmental per&s;ecutions of the old world, and meeting in the new, not as ene|mies, but as brothers. The wants which nece&s;&s;arily accompany the cultivation of a wilderne&s;s produced among them a &s;tate of &s;ociety, which countries, long hara&s;&s;ed by the quarrels and intrigues of
<PB N="3" REF="16"> governments, had neglected to cheri&s;h. In &s;uch a &s;ituation man becomes what he ought. He &s;ees his &s;pecies, not with the inhuman idea of a natural enemy, but as kindred; and the example &s;hews to the artificial world, that man mu&s;t go back to Nature for information.</P>
<P>From the rapid progre&s;s which America makes in every &s;pecies of improvement, it is rational to conclude, that if the governments of A&s;ia, Africa, and Europe, had begun on a principle &s;imilar to that of America, or had not been very early cor|rupted therefrom, that tho&s;e countries mu&s;t by this time have been in a far &s;uperior condition to what they are. Age after age has pa&s;&s;ed away, for no other purpo&s;e than to behold their wretch|edne&s;s.&mdash;Could we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;pectator who knew nothing of the world, and who was put into it merely to make his ob&s;ervations, he would take a great part of the old world to be new, ju&s;t &s;truggling with the difficulties and hard&s;hips of an infant &s;ettlement. He could not &s;uppo&s;e that the hordes of mi&s;erable poor, with which old countries abound, could be any other than tho&s;e who had not yet had time to provide for them&s;elves. Little would he think they were the con&s;equence of what in &s;uch countries is called government.</P>
<P>If, from the more wretched parts of the old world, we look at tho&s;e which are in an advanced &s;tage of improvement, we &s;till find the greedy hand of government thru&s;ting it&s;elf into every corner and crevice of indu&s;try, and gra&s;ping the &s;poil of the multitude. Invention is continually exerci&s;ed, to furni&s;h new pretences for revenue
<PB N="4" REF="17"> and taxation. It watches pro&s;perity as its prey, and permits none to e&s;cape without a tribute.</P>
<P>As revolutions have begun, (and as the proba|bility is always greater again&s;t a thing beginning, than of proceeding after it has begun), it is natural to expect that other revolutions will follow. The amazing and &s;till increa&s;ing expences with which old governments are conducted, the numerous wars they engage in or provoke, the embarra&s;&s;ments they throw in the way of univer&s;al civilization and commerce, and the oppre&s;&s;ion and u&s;urpation they act at home, have wearied out the patience, and exhau&s;ted the property of the world. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, and with the examples already exi&s;ting, revolutions are to be looked for. They are become &s;ubjects of univer&s;al conver&s;ation, and may be con&s;idered as the <HI>Order of the day.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;y&s;tems of government can be introduced, le&s;s expen&s;ive, and more productive of general happine&s;s, than tho&s;e which have exi&s;ted, all at|tempts to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s will in the end be fruitle&s;s. Rea&s;on, like time, will make its own way, and prejudice will fall in a combat with intere&s;t. If univer&s;al peace, civilization, and commerce, are ever to be the happy lot of man, it cannot be accompli&s;hed but by a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of governments. All the monarchical governments are military. War is their trade, plunder and revenue their objects. While &s;uch governments continue, peace has not the ab&s;olute &s;ecurity of a day. What is the hi&s;tory of all monarchical governments, but a di&s;gu&s;tful picture of human wretchedne&s;s, and the accidental re&s;pite
<PB N="5" REF="18"> of a few years repo&s;e? Wearied with war, and tired with human butchery, they &s;at down to re&s;t and called it peace. This certainly is not the condition that Heaven intended for man; and if <HI>this be monarchy,</HI> well might monarchy be reckon|ed among the &s;ins of the Jews.</P>
<P>The revolutions which formerly took place in the world, had nothing in them that intere&s;ted the bulk of mankind. They extended only to a change of per&s;ons and mea&s;ures but not of prin|ciples, and ro&s;e or fell among the common tran&s;|actions of the moment. What we now behold, may not improperly be called a <HI>"counter revolu|tion."</HI> Conque&s;t and tyranny, at &s;ome early period, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed man of his rights, and he is now recovering them. And as the tide of all hu|man affairs has its ebb and flow in directions con|trary to each other, &s;o al&s;o is it in this. Govern|ment founded on a <HI>moral theory, on a &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al peace, on the indefea&s;ible hereditary Rights of Man,</HI> is now revolving from we&s;t to ea&s;t, by a &s;tronger impul&s;e than the government of the &s;word revolved from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It intere&s;ts not particular individuals, but nations, in its progre&s;s, and promi&s;es a new aera to the human race.</P>
<P>The danger to which the &s;ucce&s;s of revolutions is mo&s;t expo&s;ed, is that of attempting them before the principles on which they proceed, and the advantages to re&s;ult from them, are &s;ufficiently &s;een and under&s;tood. Almo&s;t every thing apper|taining to the circum&s;tances of a nation, has been ab&s;orbed and confounded under the general and
<PB N="6" REF="19"> my&s;terious word <HI>government.</HI> Though it avoids taking to its account the errors it commits, and the mi&s;chiefs it occa&s;ions, it fails not to arrogate to it&s;elf whatever has the appearance of pro&s;perity. It robs indu&s;try of its honours, by pedanticly mak|ing it&s;elf the cau&s;e of its effects; and purloins from the general character of man, the merits that ap|pertain to him as a &s;ocial being.</P>
<P>It may therefore be of u&s;e, in this day of revolu|tions, to di&s;criminate between tho&s;e things which are the effect of government, and tho&s;e which are not. This will be&s;t be done by taking a review of &s;ociety and civilization, and the con&s;equences re|&s;ulting therefrom, as things di&s;tinct from what are called governments. By beginning with this inve&s;tigation, we &s;hall be able to a&s;&s;ign effects to their proper cau&s;e, and analize the ma&s;s of com|mon errors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF SOCIETY AND CIVILIZATION.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect of govern|ment. It has its origin in the principles of &s;ociety and the natural con&s;titution of man. It exi&s;ted prior to government, and would exi&s;t if the for|mality of government was aboli&s;hed. The mutual dependance and reciprocal intere&s;t which man has upon man, and all the parts of a civilized com|munity upon each other, create that great chain of connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the trade&s;man, and every occupation, pro&s;pers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the whole. Common intere&s;t regulates their concerns, and forms their law; and the laws which common u&s;age ordains, have a greater influence than the laws of government. In fine, &s;ociety performs for it&s;elf almo&s;t every thing which is a&s;cribed to government.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand the nature and quantity of government proper for man, it is nece&s;&s;ary to attend to his character. As Nature created him
<PB N="8" REF="21"> for &s;ocial life, &s;he fitted him for the &s;tation &s;he intended. In all ca&s;es &s;he made his natural wants greater than his individual powers. No one man is capable, without the aid of &s;ociety, of &s;upplying his own wants; and tho&s;e wants, acting upon every individual, impel the whole of them into &s;ociety, as naturally as gravitation acts to a center.</P>
<P>But &s;he has gone further. She has not only forced man into &s;ociety, by a diver&s;ity of wants, which the reciprocal aid of each other can &s;upply, but &s;he has implanted in him a &s;y&s;tem of &s;ocial affections, which, though not nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;t|ence, are e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s. There is no period in life when this love for &s;ociety cea&s;es to act. It begins and ends with our being.</P>
<P>If we examine, with attention, into the compo|&s;ition and con&s;titution of man, the diver&s;ity of his wants, and the diver&s;ity of talents in differ|ent men for reciprocally accommodating the wants of each other, his propen&s;ity to &s;ociety, and con&s;equently to pre&s;erve the advantages re&s;ulting from it, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cover, that a great part of what is called government is mere impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Government is no farther nece&s;&s;ary than to &s;upply the few ca&s;es to which &s;ociety and civilization are not conveniently competent; and in&s;tances are not wanting to &s;hew, that every thing which govern|ment can u&s;efully add thereto, has been per|formed by the common con&s;ent of &s;ociety, without government.</P>
<P>For upwards of two years from the commence|ment of the American war, and to a longer period
<PB N="9" REF="22"> in &s;everal of the American States, there were no e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of government. The old go|vernments had been aboli&s;hed, and the country was too much occupied in defence, to employ its attention in e&s;tabli&s;hing new governments; yet during this interval, order and harmony were pre&s;erved as inviolate as in any country in Europe. There is a natural aptne&s;s in man, and more &s;o in &s;ociety, becau&s;e it embraces a greater variety of abilities and re&s;ource, to accommodate it&s;elf to whatever &s;ituation it is in. The in&s;tant formal government is aboli&s;hed, &s;ociety begins to act. A general a&s;&s;ociation takes place, and common intere&s;t produces common &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>So far is it from being true, as has been pre|tended, that the abolition of any formal govern|ment is the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety, that it acts by a contrary impul&s;e, and brings the latter the clo&s;er together. All that part of its organization which it had committed to its government, de|volves again upon it&s;elf, and acts through its medium. When men, as well from natural in|&s;tinct, as from reciprocal benefits, have habituated them&s;elves to &s;ocial and civilized life, there is always enough of its principles in practice to carry them through any changes they may find nece&s;&s;ary or convenient to make in their govern|ment. In &s;hort, man is &s;o naturally a creature of &s;ociety, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to put him out of it.</P>
<P>Formal government makes but a &s;mall part of civilized life; and when even the be&s;t that human
<PB N="10" REF="23"> wi&s;dom can devi&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is a thing more in name and idea, than in fact. It is to the great and fundamental principles of &s;ociety and civilization&mdash;to the common u&s;age univer&s;ally con&s;ented to, and mutually and reciprocally main|tained&mdash;to the uncea&s;ing circulation of intere&s;t, which, pa&s;&s;ing through its million channels, in|vigorates the whole ma&s;s of civilized man&mdash;it is to the&s;e things, infinitely more than to any thing which even the be&s;t in&s;tituted government can perform, that the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the individual and of the whole depends.</P>
<P>The more perfect civilization is, the le&s;s occa&s;ion has it for government, becau&s;e the more does it regulate its own affairs, and govern it&s;elf; but &s;o contrary is the practice of old governments to the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, that the expences of them in|crea&s;e in the proportion they ought to dimini&s;h. It is but few general laws that civilized life re|quires, and tho&s;e of &s;uch common u&s;efulne&s;s, that whether they are enforced by the forms of government or not, the effect will be nearly the &s;ame. If we con&s;ider what the principles are that fir&s;t conden&s;e men into &s;ociety, and what the motives that regulate their mutual intercour&s;e afterwards, we &s;hall find, by the time we arrive at what is called government, that nearly the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s is performed by the natural opera|tion of the parts upon each other.</P>
<P>Man, with re&s;pect to all tho&s;e matters, is more a creature of con&s;i&s;tency than he is aware, or that
<PB N="11" REF="24"> governments would wi&s;h him to believe. All the great laws of &s;ociety are laws of nature. Tho&s;e of trade and commerce, whether with re&s;pect to the intercour&s;e of individuals, or of nations, are laws of mutual and reciprocal intere&s;t. They are followed and obeyed, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of the parties &s;o to do, and not on account of any formal laws their governments may impo&s;e or interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But how often is the natural propen&s;ity to &s;ociety di&s;turbed or de&s;troyed by the operations of govern|ment! When the latter, in&s;tead of being ingrafted on the principles of the former, a&s;&s;umes to exi&s;t for it&s;elf, and acts by partialities of favour and oppre&s;&s;ion, it becomes the cau&s;e of the mi&s;chiefs it ought to prevent.</P>
<P>If we look back to the riots and tumults, which at various times have happened in England, we &s;hall find, that they did not proceed from the want of a government, but that government was it&s;elf the generating cau&s;e; in&s;tead of con&s;olidating &s;ociety it divided it; it deprived it of its natural cohe&s;ion, and engendered di&s;contents and di&s;orders, which other|wi&s;e would not have exi&s;ted. In tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations which men promi&s;cuou&s;ly form for the purpo&s;e of trade, or of any concern, in which government is totally out of the que&s;tion, and in which they act merely on the principles of &s;ociety, we &s;ee how naturally the various parties unite; and this &s;hews, by compari&s;on, that governments, &s;o far from being always the cau&s;e or means of order, are often the
<PB N="12" REF="25"> de&s;truction of it. The riots of 1780 had no other &s;ource than the remains of tho&s;e prejudices, which the government it&s;elf had encouraged. But with re&s;pect to England there are al&s;o other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s and inequality of taxation, however di&s;|gui&s;ed in the means, never fail to appear in their effects. As a great ma&s;s of the community are thrown thereby into poverty and di&s;content, they are con&s;tantly on the brink of commotion; and, deprived, as they unfortunately are, of the means of information, are ea&s;ily heated to outrage. Whatever the apparent cau&s;e of any riots may be, the real one is always want of happine&s;s. It &s;hews that &s;omething is wrong in the &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, that injures the felicity by which &s;ociety is to be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But as fact is &s;uperior to rea&s;oning, the in&s;tance of America pre&s;ents it&s;elf to confirm the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions.&mdash;If there is a country in the world, where concord, according to common calculation, would be lea&s;t expected, it is America. Made up, as it is, of people from different nations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That part of America which is generally called New-England, including New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land, and Connecticut, is peopled chiefly by Engli&s;h de&s;cen|dants. In the &s;tate of New-York, about half are Dutch, the re&s;t Engli&s;h, Scotch, and Iri&s;h. In New-Jer&s;ey, a mixture of Engli&s;h and Dutch, with &s;ome Scotch and Iri&s;h. In Penn&s;ylvania, about one third are Engli&s;h, another Germans, and the remain|der Scotch and Iri&s;h, with &s;ome Swedes. The States to the &s;outhward have a greater proportion of Engli&s;h than the mid|dle States, but in all of them there is a mixture; and be&s;ides tho&s;e enumerated, there are a con&s;iderable number of French, and &s;ome few of all the European nations lying on the coa&s;t. The mo&s;t numerous religious denomination are the Pre&s;byterians; but no one &s;ect is e&s;tabli&s;hed above another, and all men are equally citizens.</NOTE>, accu&s;tomed
<PB N="13" REF="26"> to different forms and habits of government, &s;peaking different languages, and more different in their modes of wor&s;hip, it would appear that the union of &s;uch a people was impracticable; but by the &s;imple operation of con&s;tructing government on the principles of &s;ociety and the rights of man, every difficulty retires, and all the parts are brought into cordial uni&s;on. There, the poor are not oppre&s;&s;ed, the rich are not privileged. Indu&s;try is not mortified by the &s;plendid extrava|gance of a court rioting at its expence. Their taxes are few, becau&s;e their government is ju&s;t; and as there is nothing to render them wretched, there is nothing to engender riots and tumults.</P>
<P>A metaphy&s;ical man, like Mr. Burke, would have tortured his invention to di&s;cover how &s;uch a people could be governed. He would have &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome mu&s;t be managed by fraud, others by force, and all by &s;ome contrivance; that genius mu&s;t be hired to impo&s;e upon igno|rance, and &s;hew and parade to fa&s;cinate the vulgar. Lo&s;t in the abundance of his re&s;earches, he would have re&s;olved and re-re&s;olved, and finally over-looked the plain and ea&s;y road that lay directly before him.</P>
<P>One of the great advantages of the American revolution has been, that it led to a di&s;covery of
<PB N="14" REF="27"> the principles, and laid open the impo&s;ition of go|vernments. All the revolutions till then had been worked within the atmo&s;phere of a court, and never on the great floor of a nation. The parties were always of the cla&s;s of courtiers; and what|ever was their rage for reformation, they carefully pre&s;erved the fraud of the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es they took care to repre&s;ent govern|ment as a thing made up of my&s;teries, which only them&s;elves under&s;tood; and they hid from the under&s;tanding of the nation, the only thing that was beneficial to know, namely, <HI>That govern|ment is nothing more than a national a&s;&s;ociation acting on the principles of &s;ociety.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to &s;hew, that the &s;ocial and civilized &s;tate of man is capable of performing within it&s;elf, almo&s;t every thing nece&s;&s;ary to its protection and government, it will be proper, on the other hand, to take a review of the pre&s;ent old governments, and examine whether their principles and practice are corre&s;pondent thereto.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESENT OLD GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch governments as have hitherto exi&s;ted in the world, could have commenced by any other means than a total violation of every principle &s;acred and mo|ral. The ob&s;curity in which the origin of all the pre&s;ent old governments is buried, implies the iniquity and di&s;grace with which they began. The origin of the pre&s;ent government of Ame|rica and France will ever be remembered, be|cau&s;e it is honourable to record it; but with re|&s;pect to the re&s;t, even Flattery has con&s;igned them to the tomb of time, without an in&s;cription.</P>
<P>It could have been no difficult thing in the early and &s;olitary ages of the world, while the chief employment of men was that of attending flocks and herds, for a banditti of ruffians to over-run a country, and lay it under contributions. Their power being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, the chief of the band contrived to lo&s;e the name of Robber in that of Monarch; and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29">The origin of the government of England, &s;o far as relates to what is called its line of monarchy, being one of the late&s;t, is perhaps the be&s;t recorded. The hatred which the Norman inva&s;ion and tyranny begat, mu&s;t have been deeply rooted in the nation, to have outlived the con|trivance to obliterate it. Though not a courtier will talk of the curfeu-bell, not a village in England has forgotten it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e bands of robbers having parcelled out the world, and divided it into dominions, began, as is naturally the ca&s;e, to quarrel with each other. What at fir&s;t was obtained by violence, was con&s;i|dered by others as lawful to be taken, and a &s;econd plunderer &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t. They alternately invaded the dominions which each had a&s;&s;igned to him&s;elf, and the brutality with which they treated each other explains the original character of monar|chy. It was ruffian torturing ruffian. The conque|ror con&s;idered the conquered, not as his pri&s;oner, but his property. He led him in triumph rattling in chains, and doomed him, at plea&s;ure, to &s;lavery or death. As time obliterated the hi&s;tory of their beginning, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors a&s;&s;umed new appear|ances, to cut off the entail of their di&s;grace, but their principles and objects remained the &s;ame. What at fir&s;t was plunder, a&s;&s;umed the &s;ofter name of revenue; and the power originally u&s;urp|ed, they affected to inherit.</P>
<P>From &s;uch beginning of governments, what could be expected, but a continual &s;y&s;tem of war and extortion? It has e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf into a trade. The vice is not peculiar to one more than
<PB N="17" REF="30"> to another, but is the common principle of all. There does not exi&s;t within &s;uch governments, a &s;tamina whereon to ingraft reformation; and the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t effectual remedy is to begin anew.</P>
<P>What &s;cenes of horror, what perfection of ini|quity, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in contemplating the character, and reviewing the hi&s;tory of &s;uch go|vernments! If we would delineate human nature with a ba&s;ene&s;s of heart, and hypocri&s;y of coun|tenance, that reflection would &s;hudder at and hu|manity di&s;own, it is kings, courts, and cabinets, that mu&s;t &s;it for the portrait. Man, naturally as he is, with all his faults about him, is not up to the character.</P>
<P>Can we po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that if governments had originated in a right principle, and had not an intere&s;t in pur&s;uing a wrong one, that the world could have been in the wretched and quar|rel&s;ome condition we have &s;een it? What induce|ment has the farmer, while following the plough, to lay a&s;ide his peaceful pur&s;uits, and go to war with the farmer of another country? or what inducement has the manufacturer? What is dominion to them, or to any cla&s;s of men in a nation? Does it add an acre to any man's e&s;tate, or rai&s;e its value? Are not conque&s;t and defeat each of the &s;ame price, and taxes the never-failing con&s;equence?&mdash;Though this rea&s;oning may be good to a nation, it is not &s;o to a government. War is the Pharo table of governments, and na|tions the dupes of the game.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="31">If there is any thing to wonder at in this mi|&s;erable &s;cene of governments, more than might be expected, it is the progre&s;s which the peaceful arts of agriculture, manufacture and commerce have made, beneath &s;uch a long accumulating load of di&s;couragement and oppre&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF THE OLD AND NEW SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can appear more contradictory than the principles on which the old governments began, and the condition to which &s;ociety, civilization, and commerce, are capable of carrying mankind. Government on the old &s;y&s;tem, is an a&s;&s;umption of power, for the aggrandi&s;e|ment of it&s;elf; on the new, a delegation of power, for the common benefit of &s;ociety. The former &s;upports it&s;elf by keeping up a &s;y&s;tem of war; the latter promotes a &s;y&s;tem of peace, as the true means of enriching a nation. The one en|courages national prejudices; the other promotes univer&s;al &s;ociety, as the means of univer&s;al com|merce. The one mea&s;ures its pro&s;perity, by the quantity of revenue it extorts; the other proves its excellence, by the &s;mall quantity of taxes it requires.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has talked of old and new whigs. If he can amu&s;e him&s;elf with childi&s;h names and di&s;tinctions, I &s;hall not interrupt his plea&s;ure. It is not to him, but to the Abb&eacute; Sieyes, that I addre&s;s this chapter. I am already engaged to
<PB N="20" REF="33"> the latter gentleman, to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject of monarchical government; and as it naturally occurs in comparing the old and new &s;y&s;tems, I make this the opportunity of pre&s;enting to him my ob&s;ervations. I &s;hall occa&s;ionally take Mr. Burke in my way.</P>
<P>Though it might be proved that the &s;y&s;tem of government now called the NEW, is the mo&s;t ancient in principle of all that have exi&s;ted, being founded on the original inherent Rights of Man: yet, as tyranny and the &s;word have &s;u&s;pended the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rights for many centuries pa&s;t, it &s;erves better the purpo&s;e of di&s;tinction to call it the <HI>new,</HI> than to claim the right of calling it the old.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t general di&s;tinction between tho&s;e two &s;y&s;tems, is, that the one now called the old is <HI>hereditary,</HI> either in whole or in part; and the new is entirely <HI>repre&s;entative.</HI> It rejects all here|ditary government:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As being an impo&s;ition on mankind.</P>
<P>Secondly, As inadequate to the purpo&s;es for which government is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e heads&mdash;It can|not be proved by what right hereditary govern|ment could begin: neither does there exi&s;t within the compa&s;s of mortal power, a right to e&s;tabli&s;h it. Man has no authority over po&s;terity in matters of per&s;onal right; and therefore, no man, or body of men, had, or can have, a right to &s;et up hereditary government. Were even our|&s;elves to come again into exi&s;tence, in&s;tead of being &s;ucceeded by po&s;terity, we have not now the right of taking from our&s;elves the rights
<PB N="21" REF="34"> which would then be ours. On what ground, then, do we pretend to take them from others?</P>
<P>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant expla|nation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd head, that of being inadequate to the purpo&s;es for which government is nece&s;&s;ary, we have only to con&s;ider what govern|ment e&s;&s;entially is, and compare it with the cir|cum&s;tances to which hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Government ought to be a thing always in full maturity. It ought to be &s;o con&s;tructed as to be &s;uperior to all the accidents to which individual man is &s;ubject; and therefore, hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, by being <HI>&s;ubject to them all,</HI> is the mo&s;t irregular and imperfect of all the &s;y&s;tems of government.</P>
<P>We have heard the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> called a <HI>levelling</HI> &s;y&s;tem; but the only &s;y&s;tem to which the word <HI>levelling</HI> is truly applicable, is the hereditary monarchical &s;y&s;tem. It is a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>mental levelling.</HI> It indi&s;criminately admits every &s;pecies of character to the &s;ame authority. Vice and virtue, ignorance and wi&s;dom, in &s;hort, every quality, good or bad, is put on the &s;ame level. Kings &s;ucceed each other, not as rationals, but as animals. It &s;ignifies not what their mental or moral characters are. Can we then be &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="35"> at the abject &s;tate of the human mind in monar|chical countries, when the government it&s;elf is formed on &s;uch an abject levelling &s;y&s;tem?&mdash;It has no fixed character. To day it is one thing; to-morrow it is &s;omething el&s;e. It changes with the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mper of every &s;ucceeding individual, and is &s;ubject to all the varieties of each. It is govern|ment through the medium of pa&s;&s;ions and acci|dents. It appears under all the various charac|ters of childhood, decrepitude, dotage, a thing at nur&s;e, in leading-&s;trings, or in crutches. It rever&s;es the whole&s;ome order of nature. It occa|&s;ionally puts children over men, and the conceits of non-age over wi&s;dom and experience. In &s;hort, we cannot conceive a more ridiculous figure of government, than hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in all its ca&s;es, pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>Could it be made a decree in nature, or an edict regi&s;tered in heaven, and man could know it, that virtue and wi&s;dom &s;hould invariably ap|pertain to hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the objections to it would be removed; but when we &s;ee that nature acts as if &s;he di&s;owned and &s;ported with the here|ditary &s;y&s;tem; that the mental characters of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in all countries, are below the average of human under&s;tanding; that one is a tyrant, another an ideot, a third in&s;ane, and &s;ome all three together, it is impo&s;&s;ible to attach confi|dence to it, when rea&s;on in man has power to act.</P>
<P>It is not to the Abb&eacute; Sieyes that I need apply this rea&s;oning; he has already &s;aved me that trouble, by giving his own opinion upon the ca&s;e. <Q>If it
<PB N="23" REF="36"> be a&s;ked,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>what is my opinion with re&s;pect to hereditary right, I an&s;wer, without he&s;itation, That, in good theory, an hereditary tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of any power or office, can never accord with the laws of a true repre&s;entation. Hereditary&s;hip is, in this &s;en&s;e, as much an attaint upon principle, as an outrage upon &s;o|ciety. But let us,</Q> continues he, <Q>refer to the hi&s;tory of all elective monarchies and principali|ties: Is there one in which the elective mode is not wor&s;e than the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P>As to debating on which is the wor&s;t of the two, is admitting both to be bad; and herein we are agreed. The preference which the Abb&eacute; has given, is a condemnation of the thing that he prefers. Such a mode of rea&s;oning on &s;uch a &s;ubject is inadmi&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e it finally amounts to an accu&s;ation upon Providence, as if &s;he had left to man no other choice with re&s;pect to government than between two evils, the be&s;t of which he admits to be <HI>"an attaint upon principle, and an outrage upon &s;ociety."</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over, for the pre&s;ent, all the evils and mi&s;chiefs which monarchy has occa&s;ioned in the world, nothing can more effectually prove its u&s;e|le&s;sne&s;s in a &s;tate of <HI>civil government,</HI> than making it hereditary. Would we make any office here|ditary that required wi&s;dom and abilities to fill it? and where wi&s;dom and abilities are not nece&s;|&s;ary, &s;uch an office, whatever it may be, is &s;uperfluous or in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>Hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is a burle&s;que upon monarchy. It puts it in the mo&s;t ridiculous
<PB N="24" REF="37"> light, by pre&s;enting it as an office which any child or ideot may fill. It requires &s;ome talents to be a common mechanic; but, to be a king, requires only the an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al figure of man&mdash;a &s;ort of breathing automaton. This &s;ort of &s;uper&s;tition may la&s;t a few years more, but it cannot long re&s;i&s;t the awakened rea&s;on and intere&s;t of man.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Burke, he is a &s;tickler for monarchy, not altogether as a pen&s;ioner, if he is one, which I believe, but as a political man. He has taken up a contemptible opinion of mankind, who, in their turn, are taking up the &s;ame of him. He con&s;iders them as a herd of beings that mu&s;t be governed by fraud, effigy and &s;hew; and an idol would be as good a figure of monarchy with him, as a man. I will, however, do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that, with re&s;pect to America, he has been very complimentary. He always con|tended, at lea&s;t in my hearing, that the people of America were more enlightened than tho&s;e of England, or of any country in Europe; and that therefore the impo&s;ition of &s;hew was not nece&s;|&s;ary in their governments.</P>
<P>Though the compari&s;on between hereditary and elective monarchy, which the Abb&eacute; has made, is unnece&s;&s;ary to the ca&s;e, becau&s;e the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem rejects both; yet, were I to make the com|pari&s;on, I &s;hould decide contrary to what he has done.</P>
<P>The civil wars which have originated from con|te&s;ted hereditary claims, are more numerous, and have been more dreadful, and of longer continu|ance, than tho&s;e which have been occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="25" REF="38"> election. All the civil wars in France aro&s;e from the hereditary &s;y&s;tem; they were either produced by hereditary claims, or by the imperfection of the hereditary form, which admits of regencies, or monarchy at nur&s;e. With re&s;pect to England, its hi&s;tory is full of the &s;ame misfortunes. The conte&s;ts for &s;ucce&s;&s;ion between the Hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, la&s;ted a whole century; and others of a &s;imilar nature, have renewed them&s;elves &s;ince that period. Tho&s;e of 1715 and 1745, were of the &s;ame kind. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion war for the crown of Spain, embroiled almo&s;t half Europe. The di&s;turbances in Holland are generated from the hereditary&s;hip of the Stadtholder. A government calling it&s;elf free, with an hereditary office, is like a thorn in the fle&s;h, that produces a fermentation which endeavours to di&s;charge it.</P>
<P>But I might go further, and place al&s;o foreign wars, of whatever kind, to the &s;ame cau&s;e. It is by adding the evil of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that of monarchy, that a permanent family-intere&s;t is created, who&s;e con&s;tant objects are dominion and revenue. Poland, though an elective monarchy, has had fewer wars than tho&s;e which are hereditary; and it is the only government that has made a voluntary e&s;&s;ay, though but a &s;mall one, to reform the condition of the country.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at a few of the defects of the old, or hereditary &s;y&s;tems of government, let us compare it with the new, or repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem takes &s;ociety and civilization for its ba&s;is; nature, rea&s;on, and experience, for its guide.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="39">Experience, in all ages, and in all countries, has demon&s;trated, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to controul Nature in her di&s;tribution of mental powers. She gives them as &s;he plea&s;es. Whatever is the rule by which &s;he, apparently to us, &s;catters them among mankind, that rule remains a &s;ecret to man. It would be as ridiculous to attempt to fix the hereditary&s;hip of human beauty, as of wi&s;dom. Whatever wi&s;dom con&s;tituently is, it is like a &s;eedle&s;s plant; it may be reared when it appears, but it cannot be voluntarily produced. There is always a &s;ufficiency &s;omewhere in the general ma&s;s of &s;ociety for all purpo&s;es; but with re&s;pect to the parts of &s;ociety, it is continually changing its place. It ri&s;es in one to day, in another to|morrow, and has mo&s;t probably vi&s;ited in rotation every family of the earth, and again withdrawn.</P>
<P>As this is the order of nature, the order of government mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow it, or govern|ment will, as we &s;ee it does, degenerate into igno|rance. The hereditary &s;y&s;tem, therefore, is as repugnant to human wi&s;dom, as to human rights; and is as ab&s;urd, as it is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>As the republic of letters brings forward the be&s;t literary productions, by giving to genius a fair and univer&s;al chance; &s;o the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem of government is calculated to produce the wi&s;e&s;t laws, by collecting wi&s;dom from where it can be found. I &s;mile to my&s;elf when I contemplate the ridiculous in&s;ignificance into which literature and all the &s;ciences would &s;ink, were they made here|ditary; and I carry the &s;ame idea into governments. An hereditary governor is as incon&s;i&s;tent as an
<PB N="27" REF="40"> hereditary author. I know not whether Homer or Euclid had &s;ons: but I will venture an opinion, that if they had, and had left their works un|fini&s;hed, tho&s;e &s;ons could not have completed them.</P>
<P>Do we need a &s;tronger evidence of the ab&s;ur|dity of hereditary government, than is &s;een in the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e men, in any line of life, who once were famous? Is there &s;carcely an in&s;tance in which there is not a total rever&s;e of the charac|ter? It appears as if the tide of mental faculties flowed as far as it could in certain channels, and then for&s;ook its cour&s;e, and aro&s;e in others. How irrational then is the hereditary &s;y&s;tem which e&s;tabli&s;hes channels of power, in company with which wi&s;dom refu&s;es to flow! By continuing this ab&s;urdity, man is perpetually in contradiction with him&s;elf; he accepts, for a king, or a chief magi&s;trate, or a legi&s;lator, a per&s;on whom he would not elect for a con&s;table.</P>
<P>It appears to general ob&s;ervation, that revolu|tions create genius and talents; but tho&s;e events do no more than bring them forward. There is exi&s;ting in man, a ma&s;s of &s;en&s;e lying in a dor|mant &s;tate, and which, unle&s;s &s;omething excites it to action, will de&s;cend with him, in that con|dition, to the grave. As it is to the advantage of &s;ociety that the whole of its faculties &s;hould be employed, the con&s;truction of government ought to be &s;uch as to bring forward, by a quiet and re|gular operation, all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in revolutions.</P>
<P>This cannot take place in the in&s;ipid &s;tate of
<PB N="28" REF="41"> hereditary government, not only becau&s;e it pre|vents, but becau&s;e it operates to benumb. When the mind of a nation is bowed down by any poli|tical &s;uper&s;tition in its government, &s;uch as here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is, it lo&s;es a con&s;iderable portion of its powers on all other &s;ubjects and objects. Hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion requires the &s;ame obedi|ence to ignorance, as to wi&s;dom; and when once the mind can bring it&s;elf to pay this indi&s;crimi|nate reverence, it de&s;cends below the &s;tature of mental manhood. It is fit to be great only in little things. It acts a treachery upon it&s;elf, and &s;uffocates the &s;en&s;ations that urge to de|tection.</P>
<P>Though the ancient governments pre&s;ent to us a mi&s;erable picture of the condition of man, there is one which above all others exempts it&s;elf from the general de&s;cription. I mean the democracy of the Athenians. We &s;ee more to admire, and le&s;s to condemn, in that great, extraordinary peo|ple, than in any thing which hi&s;tory affords.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke is &s;o little acquainted with con&s;ti|tuent principles of government, that he confounds democracy and repre&s;entation together. Repre|&s;entation was a thing unknown in the ancient de|mocracies. In tho&s;e the ma&s;s of the people met and enacted laws (grammatically &s;peaking) in the fir&s;t per&s;on. Simple democracy was no other than the common-hall of the ancients. It &s;igni|fies the <HI>form,</HI> as well as the public principle of the government. As the&s;e democracies increa&s;ed in population, and the territory extended, the &s;imple
<PB N="29" REF="42"> democratical form became unwieldy and imprac|ticable; and as the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation was not known, the con&s;equence was, they either degenerated convul&s;ively into monarchies, or be|came ab&s;orbed into &s;uch as then exi&s;ted. Had the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation been then under|&s;tood, as it now is, there is no rea&s;on to believe that tho&s;e forms of government, now called mo|narchical or ari&s;tocratical, would ever have taken place. It was the want of &s;ome method to con&s;olidate the parts of &s;ociety, after it became too populous, and too exten&s;ive for the &s;imple democratical form, and al&s;o the lax and &s;o|litary condition of &s;hepherds and herd&s;men in other parts of the world, that afforded opportu|nities to tho&s;e unnatural modes of government to begin.</P>
<P>As it is nece&s;&s;ary to clear away the rubbi&s;h of errors, into which the &s;ubject of government has been thrown, I &s;hall proceed to remark on &s;ome others.</P>
<P>It has always been the political craft of cour|tiers and court-governments, to abu&s;e &s;omething which they called republicani&s;m; but what repub|licani&s;m was, or is, they never attempt to explain. Let us examine a little into this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The only forms of government are, the demo|cratical, the ari&s;tocratical, the monarchical, and what is now called the repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>What is called a <HI>republic,</HI> is not any <HI>particular form</HI> of government. It is wholly characteri&s;tical of the purport, matter, or object for which go|vernment ought to be in&s;tituted, and on which
<PB N="30" REF="43"> it is to be employed, RES-PUBLICA, the public affairs, or the public good; or, literally tran&s;lated, the <HI>public thing.</HI> It is a word of a good original, referring to what ought to be the character and bu&s;ine&s;s of government; and in this &s;en&s;e it is na|turally oppo&s;ed to the word <HI>monarchy,</HI> which has a ba&s;e original &s;ignification. It means arbitrary power in an individual per&s;on; in the exerci&s;e of which, <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and not the <HI>res-publica,</HI> is the object.</P>
<P>Every government that does not act on the principle of a <HI>Republic,</HI> or in other words, that does not make the <HI>res-publica</HI> its whole and &s;ole object, is not a good government. Republican government is no other than government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and conducted for the intere&s;t of the pu|blic, as well individually as collectively. It is not nece&s;&s;arily connected with any particular form, but it mo&s;t naturally a&s;&s;ociates with the repre&s;en|tative form, as being be&s;t calculated to &s;ecure the end for which a nation is at the expence of &s;up|porting it.</P>
<P>Various forms of government have affected to &s;tyle them&s;elves a republic. Poland calls it&s;elf a republic, which is an hereditary ari&s;tocracy, with what is called an elective monarchy. Holland calls it&s;elf a republic, which is chiefly ari&s;tocra|tical, with an hereditary &s;tadtholder&s;hip. But the government of America, which is wholly on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation, is the only real republic in character and in practice, that now exi&s;ts. Its government has no other object than the public bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, and therefore it is properly
<PB N="31" REF="44"> a republic; and the Americans have taken care that THIS, and no other, &s;hall always be the object of their government, by their rejecting every thing hereditary, and e&s;tabli&s;hing government on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation only.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have &s;aid that a republic is not a <HI>form</HI> of government calculated for countries of great extent, mi&s;took, in the fir&s;t place, the <HI>bu&s;i|ne&s;s</HI> of a government, for a <HI>form</HI> of government; for the <HI>res-publica</HI> equally appertains to every ex|tent of territory and population. And, in the &s;econd place, if they meant any thing with re&s;pect to <HI>form,</HI> it was the &s;imple democratical form, &s;uch as was the mode of government in the ancient de|mocracies, in which there was no repre&s;entation. The ca&s;e, therefore, is not, that a republic cannot be exten&s;ive, but that it cannot be exten&s;ive on the &s;imple democratical form; and the que&s;tion naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf, <HI>What is the be&s;t form of government for conducting the</HI> RES-PUBLICA, <HI>or the</HI> PUBLIC BUSINESS <HI>of a nation, after it becomes too exten&s;ive and populous for the &s;imple democratical form?</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be monarchy, becau&s;e monarchy is &s;ubject to an objection of the &s;ame amount to which the &s;imple democratical form was &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that an individual may lay down a &s;y&s;tem of principles, on which government &s;hall be con&s;titutionally e&s;tabli&s;hed to any extent of territory. This is no more than an operation of the mind, acting by its own powers. But the practice upon tho&s;e principles, as applying to the
<PB N="32" REF="45"> various and numerous circum&s;tances of a nation, its agriculture, manufacture, trade, commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c. requires a knowledge of a different kind, and which can be had only from the various parts of &s;ociety. It is an a&s;&s;emblage of practical knowledge, which no one individual can po&s;&s;e&s;s; and therefore the monarchical form is as much limited, in u&s;eful practice, from the incompetency of knowledge, as was the democratical form, from the multiplicity of population. The one degenerates, by exten&s;ion, into confu&s;ion; the other, into ignorance and in|capacity, of which all the great monarchies are an evidence. The monarchical form, therefore, could not be a &s;ub&s;titute for the democratical, be|cau&s;e it has equal inconveniences.</P>
<P>Much le&s;s could it when made hereditary. This is the mo&s;t effectual of all forms to preclude knowledge. Neither could the high democrati|cal mind have voluntarily yielded it&s;elf to be go|verned by children and idiots, and all the motley in&s;ignificance of character, which attends &s;uch a mere animal-&s;y&s;tem, the di&s;grace and the reproach of rea&s;on and of man.</P>
<P>As to the ari&s;tocratical form, it has the &s;ame vices and defects with the monarchical, except that the chance of abilities is better from the proportion of numbers, but there is &s;till no &s;ecu|rity for the right u&s;e and application of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a character of ari&s;tocracy, the reader is referred to <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> Part I. page 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Referring, then, to the original &s;imple democracy,
<PB N="33" REF="46"> it affords the true data from which government on a large &s;cale can begin. It is incapable of ex|ten&s;ion, not from its principle, but from the in|convenience of its form; and monarchy and ari&s;|tocracy, from their incapacity. Retaining, then, democracy as the ground, and rejecting the cor|rupt &s;y&s;tems of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, the re|pre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf; re|medying at once the defects of the &s;imple demo|cracy as to form, and the incapacity of the other two with re&s;pect to knowledge.</P>
<P>Simple democracy was &s;ociety governing it&s;elf without the aid of &s;econdary means. By ingraft|ing repre&s;entation upon democracy, we arrive at a &s;y&s;tem of government capable of embracing and confederating all the various intere&s;ts and every extent of territory and population; and that al&s;o with advantages as much &s;uperior to hereditary government, as the republic of letters is to here|ditary literature.</P>
<P>It is on this &s;y&s;tem that the American govern|ment is founded. It is repre&s;entation ingrafted upon democracy. It has fixed the form by a &s;cale parallel in all ca&s;es to the extent of the principle. What Athens was in miniature, America will be in magnitude. The one was the wonder of the an|cient world; the other is becoming the admiration and model of the pre&s;ent. It is the ea&s;ie&s;t of all the forms of government to be under&s;tood, and the mo&s;t eligible in practice; and excludes at once the igno|rance and in&s;ecurity of the hereditary mode, and the inconvenience of the &s;imple democracy.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="47">It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment capable of acting over &s;uch an extent of territory, and &s;uch a circle of intere&s;ts, as is im|mediately produced by the operation of repre&s;en|tation. France, great and populous as it is, is but a &s;pot in the capaciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem. It adapts it&s;elf to all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es. It is preferable to &s;imple democracy even in &s;mall territories. Athens, by repre&s;entation, would have outrivalled her own democracy.</P>
<P>That which is called government, or rather that which we ought to conceive government to be, is no more than &s;ome common center, in which all the parts of &s;ociety unite. This cannot be accompli&s;hed by any method &s;o conducive to the various intere&s;ts of the community, as by the repre|&s;entative &s;y&s;tem. It concentrates the knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to the intere&s;t of the parts, and of the whole. It places government in a &s;tate of con&s;tant maturity. It is, as has been already ob&s;erved, never young, never old. It is &s;ubject neither to non age, nor dotage. It is never in the cradle, nor on crutches. It admits not of a &s;epara|tion between knowledge and power, and is &s;upe|rior, as government always ought to be, to all the accidents of individual man, and is therefore &s;uperior to what is called monarchy.</P>
<P>A nation is not a body, the figure of which is to be repre&s;ented by the human body; but is like a body contained within a circle, having a com|mon center, in which every radius meets; and that center is formed by repre&s;entation. To connect
<PB N="35" REF="48"> repre&s;entation with what is called monarchy, is eccentric government. Repre&s;entation is of it&s;elf the delegated monarchy of a nation, and cannot deba&s;e it&s;elf by dividing it with another.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has two or three times, in his parlia|mentary &s;peeches, and in his publications, made u&s;e of a jingle of words that convey no ideas. Speaking of government, he &s;ays, <Q>It is better to have monarchy for its ba&s;is, and republican|i&s;m for its corrective, than republicani&s;m for its ba&s;is, and monarchy for its corrective.</Q>&mdash;If he means that it is better to correct folly with wi&s;dom, than wi&s;dom with folly, I will no otherwi&s;e con|tend with him, than that it would be much better to reject the folly entirely.</P>
<P>But what is this thing which Mr. Burke calls monarchy? Will he explain it? All men can under|&s;tand what repre&s;entation is; and that it mu&s;t nece&s;|arily include a variety of knowledge and talents. But, what &s;ecurity is there for the &s;ame qualities on the part of monarchy? or, when this monarchy is a child, where then is the wi&s;dom? What does it know about government? Who then is the monarch, or where is the monarchy? If it is to be performed by regency, it proves it to be a farce. A regency is a mock &s;pecies of republic, and the whole of monarchy de&s;erves no better de&s;cription. It is a thing as various as imagination can paint. It has none of the &s;table character that govern|ment ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is a revolution, and every regency a counter-revolu|tion. The whole of it is a &s;cene of perpetual court
<PB N="36" REF="49"> cabal and intrigue, of which Mr. Burke is him&s;elf an in&s;tance. To render monarchy con&s;i&s;tent with government, the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be born a child, but a man at once, and that man a Solomon. It is ridiculous that nations are to wait, and government be interrupted, till boys grow to be men.</P>
<P>Whether I have too little &s;en&s;e to &s;ee, or too much to be impo&s;ed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing el&s;e, I leave out of the que&s;tion; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy, always appears to me a &s;illy, contemptible thing. I compare it to &s;ome|thing kept behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of bu&s;tle and fu&s;s, and a wonderful air of &s;eeming &s;olemnity; but when, by any acci|dent, the curtain happens to be open, and the company &s;ee what it is, they bur&s;t into laughter.</P>
<P>In the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem of government, nothing of this can happen. Like the nation it&s;elf, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a perpetual &s;tamina, as well of body as of mind, and pre&s;ents it&s;elf on the open theatre of the world in a fair and manly manner. Whatever are its excellences or its defects, they are vi&s;ible to all. It exi&s;ts not by fraud and my&s;tery; it deals not in cant and &s;ophi&s;try; but in&s;pires a language, that, pa&s;&s;ing from heart to heart, is felt and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;hut our eyes again&s;t rea&s;on, we mu&s;t ba&s;ely degrade our under&s;tanding, not to &s;ee the folly of what is called monarchy. Nature is orderly in all her works; but this is a mode of
<PB N="37" REF="50"> government that counteracts nature. It turns the the progre&s;s of the human faculties up&s;ide down. It &s;ubjects age to be governed by children, and wi&s;dom by folly.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem is always parallel with the order and immutable laws of nature, and meets the rea&s;on of man in every part. For example:</P>
<P>In the American federal government, more power is delegated to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, than to any other individual member of congre&s;s. He cannot, therefore, be elected to this office under the age of thirty-five years. By this time the judgment of man becomes matured, and he has lived long enough to be acquainted with men and things, and the country with him.&mdash;But on the monarchical plan, (exclu&s;ive of the numer|ous chances there are again&s;t every man born into the world, of drawing a prize in the lottery of hu|man faculties), the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, whatever he may be, is put at the head of a nation, and of a government, at the age of eighteen years. Does this appear like an act of wi&s;dom? Is it con&s;i&s;tent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation? Where is the propriety of calling &s;uch a lad the father of the people?&mdash;In all other ca&s;es, a per&s;on is a minor until the age of twenty-one years. Before this period, he is not tru&s;ted with the management of an acre of land, or with the heritable property of a flock of &s;heep, or an herd of &s;wine; but, wonderful to tell! he may, at the age of eighteen years, be tru&s;ted with a nation.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51">That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident, (at lea&s;t to me), in every character in which it can be viewed. It would be impo&s;&s;ible, on the rational &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entative government, to make out a bill of expences to &s;uch an enormous amount as this deception admits. Government is not of it&s;elf a very chargeable in&s;titution. The whole expence of the federal government of America, founded, as I have already &s;aid, on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;enta|tion, and extending over a country nearly ten times as large as England, is but &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars, or one hundred and thirty-five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, that no man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, will compare the character of any of the kings of Europe with that of General Wa&s;hington. Yet, in France, and al&s;o in England, the expence of the civil li&s;t only, for the &s;upport of one man, is eight times greater than the whole expence of the federal government in America. To a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for this, appears almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. The generality of people in America, e&s;pecially the poor, are more able to pay taxes, than the generality of people either in France or England.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e is, that the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem diffu&s;es &s;uch a body of knowledge throughout a nation, on the &s;ubject of government, as to ex|plode ignorance and preclude impo&s;ition. The craft of courts cannot be acted on that ground. There is no place for my&s;tery; no where for it to begin. Tho&s;e who are not in the repre&s;entation, know as much of the nature of bu&s;ine&s;s as tho&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="52"> who are. An affectation of my&s;terious impor|tance would there be &s;couted. Nations can have no &s;ecrets; and the &s;ecrets of courts, like tho&s;e of individuals, are always their defects.</P>
<P>In the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, the rea&s;on for every thing mu&s;t publicly appear. Every man is a proprietor in government, and con&s;iders it a nece&s;&s;ary part of his bu&s;ine&s;s to under&s;tand. It concerns his intere&s;t, becau&s;e it affects his property. He examines the co&s;t, and com|pares it with the advantages; and above all, he does not adopt the &s;lavi&s;h cu&s;tom of following what in other governments are called LEADERS.</P>
<P>It can only be by blinding the under&s;tanding of man, and making him believe that government is &s;ome wonderful my&s;terious thing, that exce&s;&s;ive revenues are obtained. Monarchy is well calcu|lated to en&s;ure this end. It is the popery of government; a thing kept up to amu&s;e the igno|rant, and quiet them into taxes.</P>
<P>The government of a free country, properly &s;peaking, is not in the per&s;ons, but in the laws. The enacting of tho&s;e requires no great expence; and when they are admini&s;tered, the whole of civil government is performed&mdash;the re&s;t is all court contrivance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF CONSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT men mean di&s;tinct and &s;eparate things when they &s;peak of con&s;titutions and of governments, is evident; or, why are tho&s;e terms di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately u&s;ed? A con&s;titution is not the act of a government, but of a people con|&s;tituting a government; and government without a con&s;titution, is power without a right.</P>
<P>All power exerci&s;ed over a nation, mu&s;t have &s;ome beginning. It mu&s;t be either delegated, or a&s;&s;umed. There are no other &s;ources. All dele|gated power is tru&s;t, and all a&s;&s;umed power is u&s;urpation. Time does not alter the nature and quality of either.</P>
<P>In viewing this &s;ubject, the ca&s;e and circum|&s;tances of America pre&s;ent them&s;elves as in the beginning of a world; and our enquiry into the origin of government is &s;hortened, by referring to the facts that have ari&s;en in our own day. We have no occa&s;ion to roam for information into the ob|&s;cure field of antiquity, nor hazard our&s;elves upon conjecture. We are brought at once to the point of &s;eeing government begin, as if we had lived in the beginning of time. The real volume, not of
<PB N="41" REF="54"> hi&s;tory, but of facts, is directly before us, unmu|tilated by contrivance, or the errors of tradition.</P>
<P>I will here conci&s;ely &s;tate the commencement of the American con&s;titutions; by which the difference between con&s;titutions and governments will &s;ufficiently appear.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remind the reader, that the United States of America con&s;i&s;t of thir|teen &s;eparate &s;tates, each of which e&s;tabli&s;hed a government for it&s;elf, after the declaration of independence, done the fourth of July 1776. Each &s;tate acted independently of the re&s;t, in forming its government; but the &s;ame general principle per|vades the whole. When the &s;everal &s;tate govern|ments were formed, they proceeded to form the federal government, that acts over the whole in all matters which concern the intere&s;t of the whole, or which relate to the intercour&s;e of the &s;everal &s;tates with each other, or with foreign nations. I will begin with giving an in&s;tance from one of the &s;tate governments, (that of Penn&s;ylvania), and then proceed to the federal government.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, though nearly of the &s;ame extent of territory as England, was then divided into only twelve counties. Each of tho&s;e counties had elected a committee at the com|mencement of the di&s;pute with the Engli&s;h government; and as the city of Philadelphia, which al&s;o had its committee, was the mo&s;t central for intelligence, it became the center of communication to the &s;everal county committees.
<PB N="42" REF="55"> When it became nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to the formation of a government, the committee of Philadelphia propo&s;ed a conference of all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> county committees, to be held in that city, and which met the latter end of July 1776.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e committees had been elected by the people, they were not elected expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e, nor inve&s;ted with the authority, of form|ing a con&s;titution; and as they could not, con|&s;i&s;tently with the American idea of rights, a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a power, they could only confer upon the matter, and put it into a train of operation. The conferrees, therefore, did no more than &s;tate the ca&s;e, and recommend to the &s;everal counties to elect &s;ix repre&s;entatives for each county, to meet in convention at Philadelphia, with powers to form a con&s;titution, and propo&s;e it for public con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>This convention, of which Benjamin Franklin was pre&s;ident, having met and deliberated, and agreed upon a con&s;titution, they next ordered it to be publi&s;hed, not as a thing e&s;tabli&s;hed, but for the con&s;ideration of the whole people, their approbation or rejection, and then adjourned to a &s;tated time. When the time of adjournment was expired, the convention re-a&s;&s;embled; and as the general opinion of the people in approba|tion of it was then known, the con&s;titution was &s;igned, &s;ealed, and proclaimed on the <HI>authority of the people</HI> and the original in&s;trument depo&s;ited as a public record. The convention then appointed a day for the general election of the repre&s;entatives who were to compo&s;e the
<PB N="43" REF="56"> government, and the time it &s;hould commence; and having done this, they di&s;&s;olved, and returned to their &s;everal homes and occupations.</P>
<P>In this con&s;titution were laid down, fir&s;t, a declaration of rights. Then followed the form which the government &s;hould have, and the powers it &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;the authority of the courts of judicature, and of juries&mdash;the manner in which elections &s;hould be conducted, and the proportion of repre&s;entatives to the number of electors&mdash;the time which each &s;ucceeding a&s;&s;em|bly &s;hould continue, which was one year&mdash;the mode of levying, and of accounting for the expen|diture, of public money&mdash;of appointing public officers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>No article of this con&s;titution could be altered or infringed at the di&s;cretion of the government that was to en&s;ue. It was to that government a law. But as it would have been unwi&s;e to pre|clude the benefit of experience, and in order al&s;o to prevent the accumulation of errors, if any &s;hould be found, and to pre&s;erve an uni&s;on of government with the circum&s;tances of the &s;tate at all times, the con&s;titution provided, that, at the expiration of every &s;even years, a convention &s;hould be elected, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of revi&s;ing the con&s;titution, and making alterations, additions, or abolitions therein, if any &s;uch &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee a regular proce&s;s&mdash;a govern|ment i&s;&s;uing out of a con&s;titution, formed by the people in their original character; and that con|&s;titution &s;erving, not only as an authority, but as
<PB N="44" REF="57"> a law of controul to the government. It was the political bible of the &s;tate. Scarcely a family was without it. Every member of the govern|ment had a copy; and nothing was more com|mon, when any debate aro&s;e on the principle of a bill, or on the extent of any &s;pecies of authority, than for the members to take the printed con&s;ti|tution out of their pocket, and read the chapter with which &s;uch matter in debate was connected.</P>
<P>Having thus given an in&s;tance from one of the &s;tates, I will &s;hew the proceedings by which the federal con&s;titution of the United States aro&s;e and was formed.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, at its two fir&s;t meetings, in September 1774, and May 1775, was nothing more than a deputation from the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal provinces, afterwards &s;tates; and had no other authority than what aro&s;e from common con&s;ent, and the nece&s;&s;ity of its acting as a public body. In every thing which related to the internal affairs of America, congre&s;s went no further than to i&s;&s;ue recommendations to the &s;everal provincial a&s;&s;emblies, who at di&s;cretion adopted them or not. Nothing on the part of congre&s;s was compul&s;ive; yet, in this &s;ituation, it was more faithfully and affectionately obeyed, than was any government in Europe. This in&s;tance, like that of the national a&s;&s;embly in France, &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that the &s;trength of government does not con|&s;i&s;t in any thing <HI>within</HI> it&s;elf, but in the attach|ment of a nation, and the intere&s;t which the people feel in &s;upporting it. When this
<PB N="45" REF="58"> is lo&s;t, government is but a child in power; and though, like the old government of France, it may harra&s;s individuals for a while, it but facilitates its own fall.</P>
<P>After the declaration of independence, it be|came con&s;i&s;tent with the principle on which repre&s;entative government is founded, that the authority of congre&s;s &s;hould be defined and e&s;tabli&s;hed. Whether that authority &s;hould be more or le&s;s than congre&s;s then di&s;cretionarily exerci&s;ed, was not the que&s;tion. It was merely the rectitude of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the act, called the act of con|federation, (which was a &s;ort of imperfect federal con&s;titution), was propo&s;ed, and, after long delibe|ration, was concluded in the year 1781. It was not the act of congre&s;s, becau&s;e it is repugnant to the principles of repre&s;entative government that a body &s;hould give power to it&s;elf. Congre&s;s fir&s;t informed the &s;everal &s;tates, of the powers which it conceived were nece&s;&s;ary to be inve&s;ted in the union, to enable it to perform the duties and &s;ervices required from it; and the &s;tates &s;everally agreed with each other, and concenterated in congre&s;s tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that in both tho&s;e in&s;tances, (the one of Penn&s;ylvania, and the other of the United States), there is no &s;uch thing as the idea of a compact between the people on one &s;ide, and the government on the other. The compact was that of the people with each other, to produce and con&s;titute a
<PB N="46" REF="59"> government. To &s;uppo&s;e that any government can be a party in a compact with the whole people, is to &s;uppo&s;e it to have exi&s;tence before it can have a right to exi&s;t. The only in&s;tance in which a compact can take place between the people and tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the government, is, that the people &s;hall pay them, while they chu&s;e to employ them.</P>
<P>Government is not a trade which any man or body of men has a right to &s;et up and exerci&s;e for his own emolument, but is altogether a tru&s;t, in right of tho&s;e by whom that tru&s;t is delegated, and by whom it is always re&s;umeable. It has of it&s;elf no rights; they are altogether duties.</P>
<P>Having thus given two in&s;tances of the original formation of a con&s;titution, I will &s;hew the man|ner in which both have been changed &s;ince their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The powers ve&s;ted in the governments of the &s;everal &s;tates, by the &s;tate con&s;titutions, were found, upon experience, to be too great; and tho&s;e ve&s;ted in the federal government, by the act of confederation, too little. The defect was not in the principle, but in the di&s;tribution of power.</P>
<P>Numerous publications, in pamphlets and in the new&s;papers, appeared, on the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of new modelling the federal govern|ment. After &s;ome time of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, carried on through the channel of the pre&s;s, and in conver&s;ations, the &s;tate of Virginia, experiencing &s;ome inconvenience with re&s;pect to commerce, pro+po&s;ed holding a continental conference; in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="47" REF="60"> of which, a deputation from five or &s;ix of the &s;tate a&s;&s;emblies met at Anapolis in Maryland, in 1786. This meeting, not conceiving it&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently authori&s;ed to go into the bu&s;ine&s;s of a reform, did no more than &s;tate their general opinions of the propriety of the mea&s;ure, and recommend that a convention of all the &s;tates &s;hould be held the year following.</P>
<P>This convention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected with any of the &s;tate governments, or with congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</P>
<P>The convention went deeply into all the &s;ub|jects; and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a Ger|man Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t directed, that the propo&s;ed con&s;ti|tution &s;hould be publi&s;hed. Secondly, that each &s;tate &s;hould elect a convention, expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of taking it into con&s;ideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it; and that as &s;oon as the approbation and ratification of any nine &s;tates &s;hould be given, that tho&s;e &s;tates &s;hould proceed to the election of their proportion of members to
<PB N="48" REF="61"> the new federal government; and that the opera|tion of it &s;hould then begin, and the former federal government cea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;tates proceeded accordingly to elect their conventions. Some of tho&s;e conven|tions ratified the con&s;titution by very large ma|jorities, and two or three unanimou&s;ly. In others there were much debate and divi&s;ion of opinion. In the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts convention, which met at Bo&s;ton, the majority was not above nineteen or twenty, in about three hundred members; but &s;uch is the nature of repre&s;entative government, that it quietly decides all matters by majority. After the debate in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts convention was clo&s;ed, and the vote taken, the objecting mem|bers ro&s;e, and declared, <Q>That though they had argued and voted again&s;t it, becau&s;e certain parts appeared to them in a different light to what they appeared to other members; yet, as the vote had decided in favour of the con&s;titution as propo&s;ed, they &s;hould give it the &s;ame practical &s;upport as if they had voted for it.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as nine &s;tates had concurred, (and the re&s;t followed in the order their conventions were elected), the old fabric of the federal government was taken down, and the new one erected, of which General Wa&s;hington is pre&s;ident.&mdash;In this place I cannot help remarking, that the character and &s;ervices of this gentleman are &s;ufficient to put all tho&s;e men called kings to &s;hame. While they are receiving from the &s;weat and labours of man|kind, a prodigality of pay, to which neither their
<PB N="49" REF="62"> abilities nor their &s;ervices can entitle them, he is rendering every &s;ervice in his power, and refu&s;ing every pecuniary reward. He accepted no pay as commander in chief; he accepts none as pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>After the new federal con&s;titution was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, conceiving that &s;ome parts of its own con&s;titution required to be altered, elected a convention for that purpo&s;e. The propo&s;ed alterations were publi&s;hed, and the people concurring therein, they were e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In forming tho&s;e con&s;titutions, or in altering them, little or no inconvenience took place. The ordinary cour&s;e of things was not interrupted, and the advantages have been much. It is always the intere&s;t of a far greater number of people in a nation to have things right, than to let them remain wrong; and when public matters are open to debate, and the public judgment free, it will not decide wrong, unle&s;s it decides too ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>In the two in&s;tances of changing the con&s;titu|tions, the governments then in being were not actors either way. Government has no right to make it&s;elf a party in any debate re&s;pecting the principles or modes of forming, or of changing, con&s;titutions. It is not for the benefit of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the powers of government, that con|&s;titutions, and the governments i&s;&s;uing from them, are e&s;tabli&s;hed. In all tho&s;e matters, the right of judging and acting are in tho&s;e who pay, and not in tho&s;e who receive.</P>
<P>A con&s;titution is the property of a nation, and
<PB N="50" REF="63"> not of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the government. All the con&s;titutions of America are declared to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed on the authority of the people. In France, the word nation is u&s;ed in&s;tead of the people; but in both ca&s;es, a con&s;titution is a thing antecedent to the government, and always di&s;tinct there|from.</P>
<P>In England, it is not difficult to perceive that every thing has a con&s;titution, except the nation. Every &s;ociety and a&s;&s;ociation that is e&s;tabli&s;hed, fir&s;t agreed upon a number of original articles, dige&s;ted into form, which are its con&s;titution. It then appointed its officers, who&s;e powers and authorities are de&s;cribed in that con&s;titution, and the government of that &s;ociety then commenced. Tho&s;e officers, by whatever name they are called, have no authority to add to, alter, or abridge the original articles. It is only to the con&s;tituting power that this right belongs.</P>
<P>From the want of under&s;tanding the difference between a con&s;titution and a government, Dr. John&s;on, and all writers of his de&s;cription, have always bewildered them&s;elves. They could not but perceive, that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a <HI>controuling</HI> power exi&s;ting &s;omewhere, and they placed this power in the di&s;cretion of the per&s;ons exerci&s;ing the government, in&s;tead of placing it in a con&s;titution formed by the nation. When it is in a con&s;titution, it has the nation for its &s;upport, and the natural and the political controuling powers are together. The laws which are enacted by governments, controul men only as individuals,
<PB N="51" REF="64"> but the nation, through its con&s;titution, controuls the whole government, and has a natural ability &s;o to do. The final controuling power, therefore, and the original con&s;tituting power, are one and the &s;ame power.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on could not have advanced &s;uch a po&s;ition in any country where there was a con&s;ti|tution; and he is him&s;elf an evidence, that no &s;uch thing as a con&s;titution exi&s;ts in England.&mdash;But it may be put as a que&s;tion, not improper to be in|ve&s;tigated, That if a con&s;titution does not exi&s;t, how came the idea of its exi&s;tence &s;o generally e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P>In order to decide this que&s;tion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider a con&s;titution in both its ca&s;es:&mdash;Fir&s;t, as creating a government and giving it powers. Secondly, as regulating and re&s;training the powers &s;o given.</P>
<P>If we begin with William of Normandy, we find that the government of England was origi|nally a tyranny, founded on an inva&s;ion and con|que&s;t of the country. This being admitted, it will then appear, that the exertion of the nation, at different periods, to abate that tyranny, and render it le&s;s intolerable, has been credited for a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Magna Charta, as it was called, (it is now like an almanack of the &s;ame date,) was no more than compelling the government to renounce a part of its a&s;&s;umptions. It did not create and give powers to government in the manner a con|&s;titution does; but was, as far as it went, of the
<PB N="52" REF="65"> nature of a re-conque&s;t, and not of a con&s;titution; for could the nation have totally expelled the u&s;urpation, as France has done its de&s;poti&s;m, it would then have had a con&s;titution to form.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many in&s;tances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to pa&s;s tho&s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all tho&s;e in&s;tances we &s;ee nothing of a con&s;titution, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power.</P>
<P>After this, another William, de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and of the two evils, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>William,</HI> the nation preferred what it thought the lea&s;t; &s;ince, from circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it, but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation, it &s;aid, for <HI>your &s;hare,</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs, and of in&s;ult. As to what is called the convention parliament, it was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From the time of William, a &s;pecies of govern|ment
<PB N="53" REF="66"> aro&s;e, i&s;&s;uing out of this coalition bill of rights; and more &s;o, &s;ince the corruption intro|duced at the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the agency of Walpole; that can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de&s;potic legi&s;lation. Though the parts may embarra&s;s each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of it&s;elf, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the con&s;titution either that gives or that re&s;trains power?</P>
<P>It is not becau&s;e a part of the government is elective, that makes it le&s;s a de&s;poti&s;m, if the per&s;ons &s;o elected, po&s;&s;e&s;s afterwards, as a parlia|ment, unlimited powers. Election, in this ca&s;e, becomes &s;eparated from repre&s;entation, and the candidates are candidates for de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>I cannot believe that any nation, rea&s;oning on its own rights, would have thought of calling tho&s;e things <HI>a con&s;titution,</HI> if the cry of con&s;titu|tion had not been &s;et up by the government. It has got into circulation like the words <HI>bore</HI> and <HI>quoz,</HI> by being chalked up in the &s;peeches of parliament, as tho&s;e words were on window &s;hut|ters and door po&s;ts; but whatever the con&s;titu|tion may be in other re&s;pects, it has undoubtedly been <HI>the mo&s;t productive machine of taxation that was ever invented.</HI> The taxes in France, under the new con&s;titution, are not quite thirteen &s;hillings per head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole amount of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed taxes of France, for the pre&s;ent year, is three hundred millions of livres, which is twelve millions and a half &s;terling; and the incidental taxes are e&s;ti|mated at three millions, making in the whole fifteen millions and a half; which, among twenty-four millions of people, is not quite thirteen &s;hillings per head. France has le&s;&s;ened her taxes &s;ince the revolution, nearly nine millions &s;terling annually. Before the revolution, the city of Paris paid a duty of upwards of thirty per cent. on all articles brought into the city. This tax was collected at the city gates. It was taken off on the fir&s;t of la&s;t May, and the gates taken down.</NOTE>, and the taxes in England,
<PB N="54" REF="67"> under what is called its pre&s;ent con&s;titution, are forty-eight &s;hillings and &s;ixpence per head, men, women, and children, amounting to nearly &s;even|teen millions &s;terling, be&s;ides the expence of col|lection, which is upwards of a million more.</P>
<P>In a country like England, where the whole of the civil government is executed by the people of every town and county, by means of pari&s;h officers, magi&s;trates, quarterly &s;e&s;&s;ions, juries, and a&s;&s;ize; without any trouble to what is called the govern|ment, or any other expence to the revenue than the &s;alary of the judges, it is a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;uch a ma&s;s of taxes can be employed. Not even the internal defence of the country is paid out of the revenue. On all occa&s;ions, whether real or con|trived, recour&s;e is continually had to new loans and new taxes. No wonder, then, that a machine of government &s;o advantageous to the advocates of a court, &s;hould be &s;o triumphantly extolled! No won|der, that St. James's or St. Stephen's &s;hould echo with the continual cry of con&s;titution! No wonder, that the French revolution &s;hould be reprobated, and the <HI>res-publica</HI> treated with reproach! The <HI>red
<PB N="55" REF="68"> book</HI> of England, like the red book of France, will explain the rea&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What was called the <HI>livre rouge,</HI> or the red book, in France, was not exactly &s;imilar to the court calendar in England; but it &s;ufficiently &s;hewed how a great part of the taxes was lavi&s;hed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will now, by way of relaxation, turn a thought or two to Mr. Burke. I a&s;k his pardon for neg|lecting him &s;o long.</P>
<P>"America," &s;ays he, (in his &s;peech on the Canada con&s;titution bill) <Q>never dreamed of &s;uch ab&s;urd doctrine as the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke is &s;uch a bold pre&s;umer, and ad|vances his a&s;&s;ertions and his premi&s;es with &s;uch a deficiency of judgment, that, without troubling our&s;elves about principles of philo&s;ophy or politics, the mere logical conclu&s;ions they pro|duce, are ridiculous. For in&s;tance,</P>
<P>If governments, as Mr. Burke a&s;&s;erts, are not founded on the Rights of MAN, and are founded on <HI>any rights</HI> at all, they con&s;equently mu&s;t be founded on the rights of <HI>&s;omething</HI> that is <HI>not man.</HI> What then is that &s;omething?</P>
<P>Generally &s;peaking, we know of no other creatures that inhabit the earth than man and bea&s;t; and in all ca&s;es, where only two things offer them&s;elves, and one mu&s;t be admitted, a negation proved on any one, amounts to an affir|mative on the other; and therefore, Mr. Burke, by proving again&s;t the Rights of <HI>Man,</HI> proves in
<PB N="56" REF="69"> behalf of the <HI>bea&s;t;</HI> and con&s;equently, proves that government is a bea&s;t: and as difficult things &s;ometimes explain each other, we now &s;ee the origin of keeping wild bea&s;ts in the Tower; for they certainly can be of no other u&s;e than to &s;hew the origin of the government. They are in the place of a con&s;titution. O John Bull, what honours thou ha&s;t lo&s;t by not being a wild bea&s;t. Thou mighte&s;t, on Mr. Burke's &s;y&s;tem, have been in the Tower for life.</P>
<P>If Mr. Burke's arguments have not weight enough to keep one &s;erious, the fault is le&s;s mine than his; and as I am willing to make an apology to the reader for the liberty I have taken, I hope Mr. Burke will al&s;o make his for giving the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus paid Mr. Burke the compliment of remembering him, I return to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From the want of a con&s;titution in England to re&s;train and regulate the wild impul&s;e of power, many of the laws are irrational and tyrannical, and the admini&s;tration of them vague and pro|blematical.</P>
<P>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince its political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o compleatly engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and, with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="70">Almo&s;t every ca&s;e now mu&s;t be determined by &s;ome precedent, be that precedent good or bad, or whether it properly applies or not; and the prac|tice is become &s;o general, as to &s;ugge&s;t a &s;u&s;picion, that it proceeds from a deeper policy than at fir&s;t &s;ight appears.</P>
<P>Since the revolution of America, and more &s;o &s;ince that of France, this preaching up the doctrine of precedents, drawn from times and circum&s;tances antecedent to tho&s;e events, has been the &s;tudied practice of the Engli&s;h government. The gene|rality of tho&s;e precedents are founded on prin|ciples and opinions, the rever&s;e of what they ought; and the greater di&s;tance of time they are drawn from, the more they are to be &s;u&s;pected. But by a&s;&s;ociating tho&s;e precedents with a &s;uper|&s;titious reverence for ancient things, as monks &s;hew relics and call them holy, the generality of mankind are deceived into the de&s;ign. Govern|ments now act as if they were afraid to awaken a &s;ingle reflection in man. They are &s;oftly leading him to the &s;epulchre of precedents, to deaden his faculties and call his attention from the &s;cene of revolutions. They feel that he is arriving at knowledge fa&s;ter than they wi&s;h, and their policy of precedents is the barometer of their fears. This political popery, like the eccle&s;ia&s;tical popery of old, has had its day, and is ha&s;tening to its exit. The ragged relic and the antiquated precedent, the monk and the monarch, will moul|der together.</P>
<P>Government by precedent, without any regard
<PB N="58" REF="71"> to the principle of the precedent, is one of the vile&s;t &s;y&s;tems that can be &s;et up. In numerous in&s;tances, the precedent ought to operate as a warning, and not as an example, and requires to be &s;hunned in&s;tead of imitated; but in&s;tead of this, precedents are taken in the lump, and put at once for con&s;titution and for law.</P>
<P>Either the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep man in a &s;tate of ignorance, or it is a prac|tical confe&s;&s;ion that wi&s;dom degenerates in govern|ments as governments increa&s;e in age, and can only hobble along by the &s;tilts and crutches of precedents. How is it that the &s;ame per&s;ons who would proudly be thought wi&s;er than their predece&s;&s;ors, appear at the &s;ame time only as the gho&s;ts of departed wi&s;dom? How &s;trangely is an|tiquity treated! To an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;es it is &s;poken of as the times of darkne&s;s and ignorance, and to an&s;wer others, it is put for the light of the world.</P>
<P>If the doctrine of precedents, is to be followed, the expences of government need not continue the &s;ame. Why pay men extravagantly, who have but little to do? If every thing that can happen is already in precedent, legi&s;lation is at an end, and precedent, like a dictionary, determines every ca&s;e. Either, therefore, government has arrived at its dotage, and requires to be reno|vated, or all the occa&s;ions for exerci&s;ing its wi&s;dom have occured.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee all over Europe, and particularly in England, the curions phaenomenon of a nation
<PB N="59" REF="72"> looking one way, and a government the other&mdash; the one forward and the other backward. If governments are to go on by precedent, while nations go on by improvement, they mu&s;t at la&s;t come to a final &s;eparation; and the &s;ooner, and the more civilly, they determine this point, the better <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In England, the improvements in agriculture, u&s;eful arts, manufactures, and commerce, have been made in oppo&s;ition to the genius of its government, which is that of following prece|dents. It is from the enterprize and indu&s;try of the individuals, and their numerous a&s;&s;ociations, in which, tritely &s;peaking, government is neither pillow nor bol&s;ter, that the&s;e improve|ments have proceeded. No man thought about the govern|ment, or who was <HI>in,</HI> or who was <HI>out,</HI> when he was planning or executing tho&s;e things; and all he had to hope, with re&s;pect to government, was, <HI>that it would let him alone.</HI> Three or four very &s;illy mini&s;terial news-papers are continually offending again&s;t the &s;pirit of national improvement, by a&s;cribing it to a mini&s;ter. They may with as much truth a&s;cribe this book to a mini&s;ter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of con&s;titutions generally, as things di&s;tinct from actual governments, let us proceed to con&s;ider the parts of which a con&s;titu|tion is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Opinions differ more on this &s;ubject, than with re&s;pect to the whole. That a nation ought to have a con&s;titution, as a rule for the conduct of its government, is a &s;imple que&s;tion in which all men, not directly courtiers, will agree. It is only on the component parts that que&s;tions and opin|ions multiply.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="73">But this difficulty, like every other, will dimini&s;h when put into a train of being rightly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing is, that a nation has a right to e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Whether it exerci&s;es this right in the mo&s;t judicious manner at fir&s;t, is quite another ca&s;e. It exerci&s;es it agreeably to the judgment it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es; and by continuing to do &s;o, all errors will at la&s;t be exploded.</P>
<P>When this right is e&s;tabli&s;hed in a nation, there is no fear that it will be employed to its own injury. A nation can have no intere&s;t in being wrong.</P>
<P>Though all the con&s;titutions of America are on one general principle, yet no two of them are exactly alike in their component parts, or in the di&s;tribution of the powers which they give to the actual governments. Some are more, and others le&s;s complex.</P>
<P>In forming a con&s;titution, it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what are the ends for which government is nece&s;&s;ary? Secondly, what are the be&s;t means, and the lea&s;t expen&s;ive, for accompli&s;hing tho&s;e ends?</P>
<P>Government is nothing more than a national a&s;&s;ociation; and the object of this a&s;&s;ociation is the good of all, as well individually as collec|tively. Every man wi&s;hes to pur&s;ue his occupa|tion, and to enjoy the fruits of his labours, and the produce of his property in peace and &s;afety, and with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence. When the&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="74"> things are accompli&s;hed, all the objects for which government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed are an&s;wered.</P>
<P>It has been cu&s;tomary to con&s;ider government under three di&s;tinct general heads. The legi&s;la|tive, the executive, and the judicial.</P>
<P>But if we permit our judgment to act unincum|bered by the habit of multiplied terms, we can perceive no more than two divi&s;ions of power, of which civil government is compo&s;ed, namely, that of legi&s;lating or enacting laws, and that of executing or admini&s;tering them. Every thing, therefore, appertaining to civil government, cla&s;&s;es it&s;elf under one or other of the&s;e two divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>So far as regards the execution of the laws, that which is called the judicial power, is &s;trictly and properly the executive power of every country. It is that power to which every individual has appeal, and which cau&s;es the laws to be executed; neither have we any other clear idea with re&s;pect to the official execution of the laws. In England, and al&s;o in America and France, this power begins with the magi&s;trate, and proceeds up through all the courts of judicature.</P>
<P>I leave to courtiers to explain what is meant by calling monarchy the executive power. It is merely a name in which acts of government are done; and any other, or none at all, would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Laws have neither more nor le&s;s authority on this account. It mu&s;t be from the ju&s;tne&s;s of their principles, and the intere&s;t which a nation feels therein, that they derive &s;upport; if
<PB N="62" REF="75"> they require any other than this, it is a &s;ign that &s;omething in the &s;y&s;tem of government is imper|fect. Laws difficult to be executed cannot be generally good.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the organization of the <HI>legi&s;la|tive power,</HI> different modes have been adopted in different countries. In America it is generally compo&s;ed of two hou&s;es. In France it con&s;i&s;ts but of one, but in both countries it is wholly by repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is, that mankind (from the long tyranny of a&s;&s;umed power) have had &s;o few oppor|tunities of making the nece&s;&s;ary trials on modes and principles of government, in order to di&s;|cover the be&s;t, <HI>that government is but now beginning to be known,</HI> and experience is yet wanting to de|termine many particulars.</P>
<P>The objections again&s;t two hou&s;es are, fir&s;t, that there is an incon&s;i&s;tency in any part of a whole legi&s;lature, coming to a final determination by vote on any matter, whil&s;t <HI>that matter,</HI> with re&s;pect to <HI>that whole,</HI> is yet only in a train of delibera|tion, and con&s;equently open to new illu&s;trations.</P>
<P>Secondly, That by taking the vote on each, as a &s;eparate body, it always admits of the po&s;&s;ibility, and is often the ca&s;e in practice, that the minority governs the majority, and that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to a degree of great incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That two hou&s;es arbitrarily checking or controuling each other is incon&s;i&s;tent; becau&s;e it
<PB N="63" REF="76"> cannot be proved, on the principles of ju&s;t repre&s;en|tation, that either &s;hould be wi&s;er or better than the other. They may check in the wrong as well as in the right,&mdash;and therefore, to give the power where we cannot give the wi&s;dom to u&s;e it, nor be a&s;&s;ured of its being rightly u&s;ed, renders the hazard at lea&s;t equal to the precaution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>With re&s;pect to the two hou&s;es, of which the Engli&s;h Par|liament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature, to have no temper of its own. The mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedience.</P>
<P>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in Eng|land, it is manhood compared with what is called the hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nick-named hou&s;e regarded, that the people &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It ap|pears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation. In the debate on en|gaging in the Ru&s;&s;ian and Turki&s;h war, the majority in the hou&s;e of peers in favour of it was upwards of ninety, when in the other hou&s;e, which is more than double its numbers, the majority was &s;ixty-three.</P>
<P>The proceedings on Mr. Fox's bill, re&s;pecting the rights of juries, merits al&s;o to be noticed. The per&s;ons called the peers were not the objects of that bill. They are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more privileges than that bill gave to others. They are their own jury, and if any of that hou&s;e were pro&s;ecuted for a libel, he would not &s;uffer, even upon conviction, for the fir&s;t offence. Such inequality in laws ought not to exi&s;t in any country. The French con&s;titution &s;ays, That <HI>the law is the &s;ame to every individual, whether to protect or to puni&s;h. All are equal in its &s;ight.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="77">The objection again&s;t a &s;ingle hou&s;e is, that it is always in a condition of committing it&s;elf too &s;oon.&mdash;But it &s;hould at the &s;ame time be remem|bered, that when there is a con&s;titution which de|fines the power, and e&s;tabli&s;hes the principles within which a legi&s;lature &s;hall act, there is al|ready a more effectual check provided, and more powerfully operating, than any other check can be. For example,</P>
<P>Were a bill to be brought into any of the Ame|rican legi&s;latures, &s;imilar to that which was pa&s;&s;ed into an act by the Engli&s;h parliament, at the com|mencement of George the Fir&s;t, to extend the du|ration of the a&s;&s;emblies to a longer period than they now &s;it, the check is in the con&s;titution, which in effect &s;ays, <HI>Thus far &s;halt thou go and no further.</HI></P>
<P>But in order to remove the objection again&s;t a &s;ingle hou&s;e, (that of acting with too quick an impul&s;e&punc; and at the &s;ame time to avoid the incon|&s;i&s;tencies, in &s;ome ca&s;es ab&s;urdities, ari&s;ing from two hou&s;es, the following method has been pro|po&s;ed as an improvement upon both.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To have but one repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Secondly, To divide that repre&s;entation, by lot, into two or three parts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That every propo&s;ed bill, &s;hall be fir&s;t debated in tho&s;e parts by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that they may become the hearers of each other, but without taking any vote. After which the whole repre|&s;entation
<PB N="65" REF="78"> to a&s;&s;emble for a general debate and de|termination by vote.</P>
<P>To this propo&s;ed improvement has been added another, for the purpo&s;e of keeping the repre&s;en|tation in a &s;tate of con&s;tant renovation&punc; which is, that one-third of the repre&s;entation of each county, &s;hall go out at the expiration of one year, and the number be replaced by new elections.&mdash;Another third at the expiration of the &s;econd year replaced in like manner, and every third year to be a ge|neral election <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to the &s;tate of repre&s;entation in England, it is too ab&s;urd to be rea&s;oned upon. Almo&s;t all the repre&s;ented parts are decrea&s;ing in population, and the unrepre&s;ented parts are increa&s;ing. A general convention of the nation is nece&s;&s;ary to take the whole &s;tate of its government into con&s;ideration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But in whatever manner the &s;eparate parts of a con&s;titution may be arranged, there is <HI>one</HI> general principle that di&s;tingui&s;hes freedom from &s;lavery, which is, that all <HI>hereditary government over a people is to them a &s;pecies of &s;lavery, and repre&s;en|tative government is freedom.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;idering government in the only light in which it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that of a NA|TIONAL ASSOCIATION; it ought to be &s;o con|&s;tructed as not to be di&s;ordered by any accident happening among the parts; and, therefore, no extraordinary power, capable of producing &s;uch an effect, &s;hould be lodged in the hands of any indi|vidual. The death, &s;ickne&s;s, ab&s;ence, or defec|tion,
<PB N="66" REF="79"> of any one individual in a government, ought to be a matter of no more con&s;equence, with re&s;pect to the nation, than if the &s;ame circum|&s;tance had taken place in a member of the Engli&s;h Parliament, or the French National A&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>Scarcely any thing pre&s;ents a more degrading character of national greatne&s;s, than its being thrown into confu&s;ion by any thing happening to, or acted by, an individual; and the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cene is often increa&s;ed by the natural in&s;ignificance of the per&s;on by whom it is occa&s;ioned. Were a government &s;o con&s;tructed, that it could not go on unle&s;s a goo&s;e or a gander were pre&s;ent in the &s;enate, the difficulties would be ju&s;t as great and as real on the flight or &s;ickne&s;s of the goo&s;e, or the gander, as if it were called a King. We laugh at individuals for the &s;illy difficulties they make to them&s;elves, without perceiving, that the greate&s;t of all ridiculous things are acted in go|vernments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is related, that in the canton of Berne, in Swi&s;&s;erland, it had been cu&s;tomary, from time immemorial, to keep a bear at the public expence, and the people had been taught to be|lieve, that if they had not a bear they &s;hould all be undone. It happened &s;ome years ago, that the bear, then in being, was taken &s;ick and died too &s;uddenly to have his place immediately &s;upplied with another. During this interregnum the people di&s;covered, that the corn grew, and the vintage flouri&s;hed, and the &s;un and moon continued to ri&s;e and &s;et, and every thing went on the &s;ame as before, and, taking courage from the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, they re&s;olved not to keep any more bears; for &s;aid they, <Q>a bear is a very voracious, expen&s;ive animal, and we were obliged to pull out his claws, le&s;t he &s;hould hurt the citizens.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;tory of the bear of Berne was related in &s;ome of the French news-papers, at the time of the flight of Louis XVI. and the application of it to monarchy could not be mi&s;taken in France; but it &s;eems, that the ari&s;tocracy of Berne applied it to them&s;elves, and have &s;ince prohibited the reading of French news-papers.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="80">All the con&s;titutions of America are on a plan that excludes the childi&s;h embarra&s;&s;ments which occur in monarchical countries.

<P>When once &s;uch a vicious &s;y&s;tem is e&s;tabli&s;hed it becomes the guard and protection of all inferior abu&s;es. The man who is in the receipt of a mil|lion a year is the la&s;t per&s;on to promote a &s;pirit of reform, le&s;t, in the event, it &s;hould reach to him|&s;elf. It is always his intere&s;t to defend inferior abu&s;es, as &s;o many out-works to protect the cita|del; and in this &s;pecies of political fortification, all the parts have &s;uch a common dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to touch on any &s;ubject, that will not &s;ugge&s;t an allu&s;ion to &s;ome corruption in governments. The &s;imile of <HI>"fortifications,"</HI> unfortunately involves with it a cir|cum&s;tance, which is directly in point with the matter above alluded to.</P>
<P>Among the numerous in&s;tances of abu&s;e which have been acted or protected by governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of quartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its expence.</P>
<P>Humanity dictates a provi&s;ion for the poor; but by what right, moral or political, does any government a&s;&s;ume to &s;ay, that the per&s;on called the Duke of Richmond, &s;hall be maintained by the public? Yet, if common report is true, not a beggar in London can purcha&s;e his wretched pittance of coal, without paying towards the civil li&s;t of the Duke of Richmond. Were the whole produce of this impo&s;ition but a &s;hilling a year, the iniquitous principle would be &s;till the &s;ame; but when it amounts, as it is &s;aid to do, to not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> the enor|mity is too &s;erious to be permitted to remain&mdash;This is one of the effects of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>In &s;tating this ca&s;e, I am led by no per&s;onal di&s;like. Though I think it mean in any man to live upon the public, the vice originates in the government; and &s;o general is it become, that whether the parties are in the mini&s;try or in the oppo&s;ition, it makes no difference: they are &s;ure of the guarantee of each other.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="83">Monarchy would not have continued &s;o many ages in the world, had it not been for the abu&s;es it protects. It is the ma&s;ter-fraud, which &s;helters all others. By admitting a participation of the &s;poil, it makes it&s;elf friends; and when it cea&s;es to do this, it will cea&s;e to be the idol of courtiers.</P>
<P>As the principle on which con&s;titutions are now formed rejects all hereditary pretentions to government, it al&s;o rejects all that catalogue of a&s;&s;umptions known by the name of preroga|tives.</P>
<P>If there is any government where prerogatives might with apparent &s;afety be entru&s;ted to any individual, it is in the foederal government of America. The Pre&s;ident of the United States of America is elected only for four years. He is not only re&s;pon&s;ible in the general &s;en&s;e of the word, but a particular mode is laid down in the con&s;titution for trying him. He cannot be elected under thirty-five years of age; and he mu&s;t be a native of the country.</P>
<P>In a compari&s;on of the&s;e ca&s;es with the govern|ment of England, the difference when applied to the latter amounts to an ab&s;urdity. In England the per&s;on who exerci&s;es prerogative is often a
<PB N="71" REF="84"> foreigner; always half a foreigner, and always married to a foreigner. He is never in full natural or political connection with the country, is not re&s;pon&s;ible for any thing, and becomes of age at eighteen years; yet &s;uch a per&s;on is per|mitted to form foreign alliances, without even the knowledge of the nation, and to make war and peace without its con&s;ent.</P>
<P>But this is not all. Though &s;uch a per&s;on cannot di&s;po&s;e of the government, in the manner of a te&s;tator, he dictates the marriage connections, which, in effect, accompli&s;hes a great part of the &s;ame end. He cannot directly bequeath half the government to Pru&s;&s;ia, but he can form a marriage partner&s;hip that will produce almo&s;t the &s;ame thing. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it is happy for England that &s;he is not &s;ituated on the continent, or &s;he might, like Holland, fall under the dicta|tor&s;hip of Pru&s;&s;ia. Holland, by marriage, is as effectually governed by Pru&s;&s;ia, as if the old tyranny of bequeathing the government had been the means.</P>
<P>The pre&s;idency in America, (or, as it is &s;ome|times called, the executive,) is the only office from which a foreigner is excluded, and in England it is the only one to which he is ad|mitted. A foreigner cannot be a member of parliament, but he may be what is called a king. If there is any rea&s;on for excluding foreigners, it ought to be from tho&s;e offices where mi&s;chief can mo&s;t be acted, and where, by uniting every
<PB N="72" REF="85"> bias of intere&s;t and attachment, the tru&s;t is be&s;t &s;ecured.</P>
<P>But as nations proceed in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of forming con&s;titutions, they will examine with more preci&s;ion into the nature and bu&s;ine&s;s of that department which is called the executive. What the legi&s;lative and judicial departments are, every one can &s;ee; but with re&s;pect to what, in Europe, is called the executive, as di&s;tinct from tho&s;e two, it is either a political &s;uperfluity or a chaos of unknown things.</P>
<P>Some kind of official department, to which reports &s;hall be made from the different parts of a nation, or from abroad, to be laid before the national repre&s;entatives, is all that is nece&s;&s;ary; but there is no con&s;i&s;tency in calling this the executive; neither can it be con&s;idered in any other light than as inferior to the legi&s;lative. The &s;overeign authority in any country is the power of making laws, and every thing el&s;e is an official department.</P>
<P>Next to the arrangement of the principles and the organization of the &s;everal parts of a con&s;ti|tution, is the provi&s;ion to be made for the &s;up|port of the per&s;ons to whom the nation &s;hall confide the admini&s;tration of the con&s;titutional powers.</P>
<P>A nation can have no right to the time and &s;ervices of any per&s;on at his own expence, whom it may chu&s;e to employ or entru&s;t in any depart|ment whatever; neither can any rea&s;on be given
<PB N="73" REF="86"> for making provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of any one part of a government and not for the other.</P>
<P>But, admitting that the honour of being en|tru&s;ted with any part of a government is to be con&s;idered a &s;ufficient reward, it ought to be &s;o to every per&s;on alike. If the members of the legi&s;lature of any country are to &s;erve at their own expence, that which is called the executive, whether monarchical, or by any other name, ought to &s;erve in like manner. It is incon&s;i&s;tent to pay the one, and accept the &s;ervice of the other gratis.</P>
<P>In America, every department in the govern|ment is decently provided for; but no one is extravagantly paid. Every member of Congre&s;s, and of the a&s;&s;emblies, is allowed a &s;ufficiency for his expences. Whereas in England, a mo&s;t prodigal provi&s;ion is made for the &s;upport of one part of the government, and none for the other, the con&s;equence of which is, that the one is furni&s;hed with the means of corruption, and the other is put into the condition of being corrupted. Le&s;s than a fourth part of &s;uch expence, applied as it is in America, would remedy a great part of the corruption.</P>
<P>Another reform in the American con&s;titutions, is the exploding all oaths of per&s;onality. The oath of allegiance in America is to the nation only. The putting any individual as a figure for a nation is improper. The happine&s;s of a nation is the &s;uperior object, and therefore the intention
<PB N="74" REF="87"> of an oath of allegiance ought not to be ob&s;cured by being figuratively taken, to, or in the name of, any per&s;on. The oath, called the civic oath, in France, viz. the <HI>"nation, the law, and the king,"</HI> is improper. If taken at all, it ought to be as in America, to the nation only. The law may or may not be good; but, in this place, it can have no other meaning, than as being conducive to the happine&s;s of the nation, and therefore is included in it. The remainder of the oath is improper, on the ground, that all per&s;onal oaths ought to be aboli&s;hed. They are the remains of tyranny on one part, and &s;lavery on the other; and the name of the CREATOR ought not to be introduced to witne&s;s the degradation of his creation; or if taken, as is already mentioned, as figurative of the nation, it is in this place redundant. But whatever apology may be made for oaths at the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a government, they ought not to be permitted afterwards. If a govern|ment requires the &s;upport of oaths, it is a &s;ign that it is not worth &s;upporting, and ought not to be &s;upported. Make government what it ought to be, and it will &s;upport it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To conclude this part of the &s;ubject:&mdash;One of the greate&s;t improvements that has been made for the perpetual &s;ecurity and progre&s;s of con&s;ti|tutional liberty, is the provi&s;ion which the new con&s;titutions make for occa&s;ionally revi&s;ing, altering, and amending them.</P>
<P>The principle upon which Mr. Burke formed
<PB N="75" REF="88"> his political creed, that <Q>of binding and controul|ing po&s;terity to the end of time, and of renouncing and abdicating the rights of all po&s;terity for ever,</Q> is now become too dete&s;table to be made a &s;ubject of debate; and, therefore, I pa&s;s it over with no other notice than expo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Government is but now beginning to be known. Hitherto it has been the mere exer|ci&s;e of power, which forbad all effectual en|quiry into rights, and grounded it&s;elf wholly on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. While the enemy of liberty was its judge, the progre&s;s of its principles mu&s;t have been &s;mall indeed.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutions of America, and al&s;o that of France, have either affixed a period for their re|vi&s;ion, or laid down the mode by which improve|ments &s;hall be made. It is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h any thing that combines principles with opinions and practice, which the progre&s;s of circum&s;tances, through a length of years, will not in &s;ome mea&s;ure derange, or render incon&s;i&s;tent; and, therefore, to prevent inconveniences accu|mulating, till they di&s;courage reformations or provoke revolutions, it is be&s;t to provide the means of regulating them as they occur. The Rights of Man are the rights of all generations of men, and cannot be monopolized by any. That which is worth following, will be followed for the &s;ake of its worth; and it is in this that its &s;ecurity lies, and not in any conditions with which it may be encumbered. When a man
<PB N="76" REF="89"> leaves property to his heirs, he does not connect it with an obligation that they &s;hall accept it. Why then &s;hould we do otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to con&s;titutions?</P>
<P>The be&s;t con&s;titution that could now be de|vi&s;ed, con&s;i&s;tent with the condition of the pre&s;ent moment, may be far &s;hort of that excellence which a few years may afford. There is a morning of rea&s;on ri&s;ing upon man on the &s;ubject of government, that has not appeared before. As the barbari&s;m of the pre&s;ent old governments expires, the moral condition of nations with re&s;pect to each other will be changed. Man will not be brought up with the &s;avage idea of con&s;idering his &s;pecies as his enemy, becau&s;e the accident of birth gave the individuals exi&s;tence in countries di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names; and as con&s;titutions have always &s;ome relation to external as well as to dome&s;tic circum|&s;tances, the means of benefiting by every change, foreign or dome&s;tic, &s;hould be a part of every con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>We already &s;ee an alteration in the national di&s;po&s;ition of England and France towards each other, which, when we look back to only a few years, is it&s;elf a revolution. Who could have fore&s;een, or who would have believed, that a French National A&s;&s;embly would ever have been a popular toa&s;t in England, or that a friendly alliance of the two nations &s;hould become the wi&s;h of either. It &s;hews, that man, were he not
<PB N="77" REF="90"> corrupted by governments, is naturally the friend of man, and that human nature is not of it&s;elf vicious. That &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and ferocity, which the governments of the two countries in&s;pired, and which they rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;e of taxation, is now yielding to the dictates of rea&s;on, intere&s;t, and humanity. The trade of courts is beginning to be under&s;tood, and the affectation of my&s;tery, with all the artificial &s;orcery by which they impo&s;ed upon mankind, is on the decline. It has received its death-wound; and though it may linger, it will expire.</P>
<P>Government ought to be as much open to improvement as any thing which appertains to man, in&s;tead of which it has been monopo|lized from age to age, by the mo&s;t ignorant and vicious of the human race. Need we any other proof of their wretched manage|ment, than the exce&s;s of debts and taxes with which every nation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t emerging from &s;uch a barbarous con|dition, it is too &s;oon to determine to what extent of improvement government may yet be carried. For what we can fore&s;ee, all Europe may form but one great republic, and man be free of the whole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. WAYS AND MEANS of improving the condi|tion of EUROPE, inter&s;per&s;ed with MISCELLA|NEOUS OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN contemplating a &s;ubject that embraces with equatorial magnitude the whole region of hu|manity, it is impo&s;&s;ible to confine the pur&s;uit in one &s;ingle direction. It takes ground on every character and condition that appertains to man, and blends the individual, the nation, and the world.</P>
<P>From a &s;mall &s;park, kindled in America, a flame has ari&s;en, not to be extingui&s;hed. With|out con&s;uming, like the <HI>Ultima Ratio Regum,</HI> it winds its progre&s;s from nation to nation, and conquers by a &s;ilent operation. Man finds him&s;elf changed, he &s;carcely perceives how. He acquires a knowledge of his rights by attending ju&s;tly to his intere&s;t, and di&s;covers in the event that the &s;trength and powers of de&s;poti&s;m con&s;i&s;t wholly in the fear of re&s;i&s;ting it, and that, in order <Q>to be free, it is &s;ufficient that he wills it.</Q></P>
<P>Having in all the preceding parts of this work endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of principles as a ba&s;is, on which governments ought to be erected; I &s;hall proceed in this, to the ways and means of rendering them into practice. But in order to introduce this part of the &s;ubject with
<PB N="79" REF="92"> more propriety, and &s;tronger effect, &s;ome preli|minary ob&s;ervations, deducible from, or connected with, tho&s;e principles, are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Whatever the form or con&s;titution of govern|ment may be, it ought to have no other object than the <HI>general</HI> happine&s;s. When, in&s;tead of this, it operates to create and encrea&s;e wretchedne&s;s in any of the parts of &s;ociety, it is on a wrong &s;y&s;|tem, and reformation is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tomary language has cla&s;&s;ed the condition. of man under the two de&s;criptions of civilized and uncivilized life. To the one it has a&s;cribed feli|city and affluence; to the other hard&s;hip and want. But, however, our imagination may be impre&s;&s;ed by painting and compari&s;on, it is neverthele&s;s true, that a great portion of mankind, in what are called civilized countries, are in a &s;tate of poverty and wretchedne&s;s, far below the condi|tion of an Indian&punc; I &s;peak not of one country, but of all. It is &s;o in England, it is &s;o all over Eu|rope. Let us enquire into the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It lies not in any natural defect in the prin|ciples of civilization, but in preventing tho&s;e principles having an univer&s;al operation; the con|&s;equence of which is, a perpetual &s;y&s;tem of war and expence, that drains the country, and defeats the general felicity of which civilization is capa|ble.</P>
<P>All the European governments (France now excepted) are con&s;tructed not on the principle of univer&s;al civilization, but on the rever&s;e of it. So far as tho&s;e governments relate to each other,
<PB N="80" REF="93"> they are in the &s;ame condition as we conceive of &s;avage uncivilized life; they put them&s;elves be|yond the law as well of GOD as of man, and are, with re&s;pect to principle and reciprocal conduct, like &s;o many individuals in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of every country, under the civilization of laws, ea&s;ily civilize together, but governments being yet in an uncivilized &s;tate, and almo&s;t continually at war, they pervert the abun|dance which civilized life produces to carry on the uncivilized part to a greater extent. By thus engrafting the barbari&s;m of government upon the internal civilization of a country, it draws from the latter, and more e&s;pecially from the poor, a great portion of tho&s;e earnings, which &s;hould be applied to their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and comfort.&mdash;A|part from all reflections of morality and philo&s;ophy, it is a melancholy fact, that more than one-fourth of the labour of mankind is annually con&s;umed by this barbarous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>What has &s;erved to continue this evil, is the pecuniary advantage, which all the governments of Europe have found in keeping up this &s;tate of un|civilization. It affords to them pretences for power, and revenue, for which there would be neither occa&s;ion nor apology, if the circle of civi|lization were rendered compleat. Civil govern|ment alone, or the government of laws, is not productive of pretences for many taxes; it ope|rates at home, directly under the eye of the coun|try, and precludes the po&s;&s;ibility of much impo&s;i|tion. But when the &s;cene is laid in the unciviliz|ed
<PB N="81" REF="94"> contention of governments, the field of pre|tences is enlarged, and the country, being no longer a judge, is open to every impo&s;ition, which governments plea&s;e to act.</P>
<P>Not a thirtieth, &s;carely a fortieth, part of the taxes which are rai&s;ed in England are either occa&s;ioned by, or applied to, the purpo&s;es of civil government. It is not difficult to &s;ee, that the whole which the actual government does in this re&s;pect, is to enact laws, and that the country admini&s;ters and executes them, at its own ex|pence, by means of magi&s;trates, juries, &s;e&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;ize, over and above the taxes which it pays.</P>
<P>In this view of the ca&s;e, we have two di&s;tinct characters of government; the one the civil government, or the government of laws, which operates at home, the other the court or cabi|net government, which operates abroad, on the rude plan of uncivilized life; the one attended with little charge, the other with boundle&s;s extra|vagance; and &s;o di&s;tinct are the two, that if the latter were to &s;ink, as it were by a &s;udden open|ing of the earth, and totally di&s;appear, the former would not be deranged. It would &s;till proceed, becau&s;e it is the common intere&s;t of the nation that it &s;hould, and all the means are in practice.</P>
<P>Revolutions, then, have for their object, a change in the moral condition of governments, and with this change the burthen of public taxes will le&s;&s;en, and civilization will be left to the en|joyment of that abundance, of which it is now de|prived.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="95">In contemplating the whole of this &s;ubject, I extend my views into the department of com|merce. In all my publications, where the matter would admit, I have been an advocate for com|merce, becau&s;e I am a friend to its effects. It is a pacific &s;y&s;tem, operating to cordialize mankind, by rendering nations, as well as individuals, u&s;eful to each other. As to mere theoretical reformation, I have never preached it up. The mo&s;t effectual proce&s;s is that of improving the condition of man by means of his intere&s;t; and it is on this ground that I take my &s;tand.</P>
<P>If commerce were permitted to act to the uni|ver&s;al extent it is capable, it would extirpate the &s;y&s;tem of war, and produce a revolution in the uncivilized &s;tate of governments. The invention of commerce has ari&s;en &s;ince tho&s;e governments began, and is the greate&s;t approach towards uni|ver&s;al civilization, that has yet been made by any means not immediately flowing from moral principles.</P>
<P>Whatever has a tendency to promote the civil intercour&s;e of nations, by an exchange of benefits, is a &s;ubject as worthy of philo&s;ophy as of politics. Commerce is no other than the traffic of two indi|viduals, multiplied on a &s;cale of numbers; and by the &s;ame rule that nature intended the inter|cour&s;e of two, &s;he intended that of all. For this purpo&s;e &s;he has di&s;tributed the materials of manu|factures and commerce, in various and di&s;tant parts of a nation and of the world; and as they cannot be procured by war &s;o cheaply or &s;o com|modiou&s;ly
<PB N="83" REF="96"> as by commerce, &s;he has rendered the latter the means of extirpating the former.</P>
<P>As the two are nearly the oppo&s;ites of each other, con&s;equently, the uncivilized &s;tate of Eu|ropean governments is injurious to commerce. Every kind of de&s;truction or embarra&s;&s;ment &s;erves to le&s;&s;en the quantity, and it matters but little in what part of the commercial world the reduction begins. Like blood, it cannot be taken from any of the parts, without being taken from the whole ma&s;s in circulation, and all partake of the lo&s;s. When the ability in any nation to buy is de&s;troyed, it equally involves the &s;eller. Could the government of England de&s;troy the commerce of all other nations, &s;he would mo&s;t effectually ruin her own.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that a nation may be the car|rier for the world, but &s;he cannot be the mer|chant. She cannot be the &s;eller and the buyer of her own merchandize. The ability to buy mu&s;t re&s;ide out of her&s;elf; and, therefore, the pro&s;perity of any commercial nation is regulated by the pro&s;perity of the re&s;t. If they are poor &s;he cannot be rich, and her condition, be it what it may, is an index of the height of the commercial tide in other nations.</P>
<P>That the principles of commerce, and its uni|ver&s;al operation may be under&s;tood, without un|der&s;tanding the practice, is a po&s;ition that rea&s;on will not deny; and it is on this ground only that I argue the &s;ubject. It is one thing in the
<PB N="84" REF="97"> counting-hou&s;e, in the world it is another. With re&s;pect to its operation it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be contemplated as a reciprocal thing; that only one half its powers re&s;ides within the nation, and that the whole is as effectually de&s;troyed by de|&s;troying the half that re&s;ides without, as if the de&s;truction had been committed on that which is within; for neither can act without the other.</P>
<P>When in the la&s;t, as well as in former wars, the commerce of England &s;unk, it was becau&s;e the general quantity was le&s;&s;ened every where; and it now ri&s;es, becau&s;e commerce is in a ri&s;ing &s;tate in every nation. If England, at this day, imports and exports more than at any former period, the nations with which &s;he trades mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do the &s;ame; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> imports are their exports, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>There can be no &s;uch thing as a nation flouri&s;h|ing alone in commerce; &s;he can only participate; and the de&s;truction of it in any part mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily affect all. When, therefore, governments are at war, the attack is made upon the common &s;tock of commerce, and the con&s;equence is the &s;ame as if each had attacked his own.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent increa&s;e of commerce is not to be attributed to mini&s;ters, or to any political con|trivances, but to its own natural operations in con&s;equence of peace. The regular markets had been de&s;troyed, the channels of trade broken up, the high road of the &s;eas infe&s;ted with robbers of every nation, and the attention of the world called to other objects. Tho&s;e interruptions have cea&s;ed,
<PB N="85" REF="98"> and peace has re&s;tored the deranged condition of things to their proper order <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In America, the increa&s;e of commerce is greater in pro|portion than in England. It is, at this time, at lea&s;t one half more than at any period prior to the revolution. The greate&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els cleared out of the port of Philadelphia, before the commencement of the war, was between eight and nine hundred. In the year 1788, the number was upwards of twelve hundred. As the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is e&s;timated as an eighth part of the United States in population, the whole number of ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t now be nearly ten thou&s;and.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that every nation reck|ons the balance of trade in its own favour; and therefore &s;omething mu&s;t be irregular in the common ideas upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fact, however, is true, according to what is called a balance; and it is from this cau&s;e that commerce is univer&s;ally &s;upported. Every nation feels the advantage, or it would abandon the practice: but the deception lies in the mode of making up the accounts, and in attributing what are called profits to a wrong cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt has &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;hewing what he called a balance of trade from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books. This mode of calcula|tion, not only affords no rule that is true, but one that is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, Every cargo that departs from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, appears on the books as an export; and, according to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e balance, the lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea, and by foreign failures,
<PB N="86" REF="99"> are all reckoned on the &s;ide of profit, becau&s;e they appear as exports.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e the importation by the &s;muggling trade does not appear on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, to arrange again&s;t the exports.</P>
<P>No balance, therefore, as applying to &s;uperior advantages, can be drawn from tho&s;e documents; and if we examine the natural operation of com|merce, the idea is fallacious; and if true, would &s;oon be injurious. The great &s;upport of com|merce con&s;i&s;ts in the balance being a level of benefits among all nations.</P>
<P>Two merchants of different nations trading to|gether, will both become rich, and each makes the balance in his own favour; con&s;equently, they do not get rich out of each other; and it is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the nations in which they re&s;ide. The ca&s;e mu&s;t be, that each nation mu&s;t get rich out of its own means, and increa&s;es that riches by &s;omething which it procures from another in exchange.</P>
<P>If a merchant in England &s;ends an article of Engli&s;h manufacture abroad, which co&s;ts him a &s;hilling at home, and imports &s;omething which &s;ells for two, he makes a balance of one &s;hilling in his own favour: but this is not gained out of the foreign nation or the foreign merchant, for he al&s;o does the &s;ame by the article he receives, and neither has a balance of advantage upon the other. The original value of the two articles in their proper countries were but two &s;hillings; but by
<PB N="87" REF="100"> changing their places, they acquire a new idea of value, equal to double what they had at fir&s;t, and that increa&s;ed value is equally divided.</P>
<P>There is no otherwi&s;e a balance on foreign than on dome&s;tic commerce. The merchants of London and Newca&s;tle trade on the &s;ame princi|ples, as if they re&s;ided in different nations, and make their balances in the &s;ame manner: yet London does not get rich out of Newca&s;tle, any more than Newca&s;tle out of London: but coals, the merchandize of Newca&s;tle, have an additional value at London, and London merchandize has the &s;ame at Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Though the principle of all commerce is the &s;ame, the dome&s;tic, in a national view, is the part the mo&s;t beneficial; becau&s;e the whole of the advantages, on both &s;ides, re&s;ts within the nation; whereas, in foreign commerce, it is only a participation of one half.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t unprofitable of all commerce is that connected with foreign dominion. To a few individuals it may be beneficial, merely becau&s;e it is commerce; but to the nation it is a lo&s;s. The expence of maintaining dominion more than ab&s;orbs the profits of any trade. It does not increa&s;e the general quantity in the world, but operates to le&s;&s;en it; and as a greater ma&s;s would be afloat by relinqui&s;hing dominion, the partici|pation without the expence would be more valu|able than a greater quantity with it.</P>
<P>But it is impo&s;&s;ible to engro&s;s commerce by
<PB N="88" REF="101"> dominion; and therefore it is &s;till more fallacious. It cannot exi&s;t in confined channels, and nece&s;|&s;arily breaks out by regular or irregular means, that defeat the attempt; and to &s;ucceed would be &s;till wor&s;e. France, &s;ince the revolution, has been more than indifferent as to foreign po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; and other nations will become the &s;ame, when they inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject with re&s;pect to commerce.</P>
<P>To the expence of dominion is to be added that of navies, and when the amount of the two are &s;ubtracted from the profits of commerce, it will appear, that what is called the balance of trade, even admitting it to exi&s;t, is not enjoyed by the nation, but ab&s;orbed by the government.</P>
<P>The idea of having navies for the protection of commerce is delu&s;ive. It is putting the means of de&s;truction for the means of protection. Com|merce needs no other protection than the recipro|cal intere&s;t which every nation feels in &s;upport|ing it&mdash;it is common &s;tock&mdash;it exi&s;ts by a balance of advantages to all; and the only inter|ruption it meets, is from the pre&s;ent uncivilized &s;tate of governments, and which it is its com|mon intere&s;t to reform <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I &s;aw Mr. Pitt's mode of e&s;timating the balance of trade, in one of his parliamentary &s;peeches, he appeared to me to know nothing of the nature and intere&s;t of commerce; and no man has more wantonly tortured it than him&s;elf. During a period of peace, it has been havocked with the calamities of war. Three times has it been thrown into &s;tagnation, and the ve&s;&s;els unmaned by impre&s;&s;ing, within le&s;s than four years of peace.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="102">Quitting this &s;ubject, I now proceed to other matters.&mdash;As it is nece&s;&s;ary to include England in the pro&s;pect of a general reformation, it is proper to enquire into the defects of its govern|ment.

<P>As a new &s;y&s;tem is now opening to the view of the world, the European courts are plotting to counteract it. Alliances, contrary to all former &s;y&s;tems, are agitating, and a common intere&s;t of courts is forming again&s;t the common intere&s;t of man. This combination draws a line that runs throughout Europe, and pre&s;ents a cau&s;e &s;o entirely new, as to exclude all calculations from former circum&s;tances. While de&s;poti&s;m warred with de&s;poti&s;m, man had no intere&s;t in the con|te&s;t; but in a cau&s;e that unites the &s;oldier with the citizen, and nation with nation, the de&s;poti&s;m of courts, though it feels the danger, and medi|tates revenge, is afraid to &s;trike.</P>

I did not, at my fir&s;t &s;etting out in pub|lic life, nearly &s;eventeen years ago, turn my thoughts to &s;ubjects of government from motives of intere&s;t; and my conduct from that moment to this, proves the fact. I &s;aw an opportunity, in which I thought I could do &s;ome good, and I followed exactly what my heart dictated. I neither read books, nor &s;tudied other people's opinions. I thought for my&s;elf. The ca&s;e was this:</P>
<P>During the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the old governments in America, both prior to, and at the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, I was &s;truck with the order and decorum with which every thing was conducted; and impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that a little more than what &s;ociety naturally performed, was all the government that was nece&s;&s;ary; and that monarchy and ari&s;tocracy were frauds and impo&s;itions upon mankind. On the&s;e principles I pub|li&s;hed the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s it met with was beyond any thing &s;ince the invention of printing.

<P>After the declaration of independence, Congre&s;s unani|mou&s;ly, and unknown to me, appointed me &s;ecretary in the foreign department. This was agreeable to me, becau&s;e it gave me the opportunity of &s;eeing into the abilities of foreign courts, and their manner of doing bu&s;ine&s;s. But a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;ing between congre&s;s and me, re&s;pecting one of their com|mi&s;&s;ioners, then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, I re&s;igned the office, and declined, at the &s;ame time, the pecuniary offers made me by the mini&s;ters of France and Spain, M. Gerard and Don Juan Mirralles.</P>
<P>I had by this time &s;o completely gained the ear and confi|dence of America, and my own independence was become &s;o vi&s;ible as to give me a range in political writing, beyond, per|haps, what any man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in any country; and what is more extraordinary, I held it undimini&s;hed to the end of the war, and enjoy it in the &s;ame manner to the pre&s;ent moment. As my object was not my&s;elf, I &s;et out with the determination, and happily with the di&s;po&s;ition, of not being moved by prai&s;e or cen&s;ure, friend&s;hip or calumny, nor of being drawn from my purpo&s;e by any per&s;onal altereation; and the man who cannot do this, is not fit for a public character.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>During the war, in the latter end of the year 1780, I formed to my&s;elf a de&s;ign of coming over to England; and communi|cated it to General Greene, who was then in Philadelphia, on his route to the &s;outhward, General Wa&s;hington being then at too great a di&s;tance to communicate with immediately. I was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that if I could get over to England, without being known, and only remain in &s;afety till I could get out a publication, that I could open the eyes of the country with re&s;pect to the madne&s;s and &s;tupidity of its govern|ment. I &s;aw that the parties in parliament had pitted them|&s;elves as far as they could go, and could make no new impre&s;|&s;ions on each other. General Greene entered fully into my views; but the affair of Arnold and Andr&egrave; happening ju&s;t after, he changed his mind, and, under &s;trong apprehen&s;ions for my &s;afety, wrote very pre&s;&s;ingly to me from Anapolis, in Maryland, to give up the de&s;ign, which, with &s;ome reluctance, I did. Soon after this I accompanied Col. Lawrens, &s;on of Mr. Lawrens, who was then in the Tower, to France, on bu&s;ine&s;s from Congre&s;s. We landed at L'Orient; and while I remained there, he being gone forward, a circum&s;tance occurred, that renewed my former de&s;ign. An Engli&s;h packet from Falmouth to New-York, with the government di&s;patches on board, was brought into L'Orient. That a packet &s;hould be taken, is no extraordinary thing; but that the di&s;patches &s;hould be taken with it, will &s;carcely be credited, as they are always &s;lung at the cabin window, in a bag loaded with cannon-ball, and ready to be &s;unk at a moment. The fact, however, is as I have &s;tated it, for the di&s;patches came into my hands, and I read them. The capture, as I was informed, &s;ucceeded by the following &s;tratagem:&mdash;The captain of the Madame privateer, who &s;poke Engli&s;h, on coming up with the packet, pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for the captain of an Engli&s;h frigate, and invited the captain of the paeket on board, which, when done, he &s;ent &s;ome of his own hands back, and &s;ecured the mail. But be the circum&s;tance of the capture what it may, I &s;peak with certainty as to the government di&s;patches. They were &s;ent up to Paris, to Count Vergennes, and when Col. Lawrens and my&s;elf returned to America, we took the originals to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>By the&s;e di&s;patches I &s;aw into the &s;tupidity of the Engli&s;h cabinet, far more than I otherwi&s;e could have done, and I renewed my former de&s;ign. But Col. Lawrens was &s;o unwill|ing to return alone; more e&s;pecially, as among other matters, we had a charge of upwards of two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in money, that I gave into his wi&s;hes, and finally gave up my plan. But I am now certain, that if I could have exe|cuted it, that it would not have been altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I begin with charters and corporations.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="106">It is a perver&s;ion of terms to &s;ay, that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect, that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently
<PB N="94" REF="107"> in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling tho&s;e rights in the majority, leave the right by
<PB N="95" REF="108"> exclu&s;ion in the hands of a few. If charters were con&s;tructed &s;o as to expre&s;s in direct terms,
<Q><PB N="96" REF="109">that every inhabitant, who is not a member of a corporation, &s;hall not exerci&s;e the right of voting,</Q> &s;uch charters would, in the face, be charters, not of rights, but of exclu&s;ion. The effect is the &s;ame under the form they now &s;tand; and the only per&s;ons on whom they operate, are the per&s;ons whom they exclude. Tho&s;e who&s;e rights are guaranteed, by not being taken away, exer|ci&s;e no other rights, than as members of the com|munity they are entitled to without a charter; and, therefore, all charters have no other than an indirect negative operation. They do not give rights to A, but they make a difference in favour of A by taking away the right of B, and con&s;e|quently are in&s;truments of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But charters and corporations have a more exten&s;ive evil effect, than what relates merely to elections. They are &s;ources of endle&s;s conten|tions in the places where they exi&s;t; and they le&s;&s;en the common rights of national &s;ociety. A native of England, under the operation of the&s;e charters and corporations, cannot be &s;aid to be an Engli&s;hman in the full &s;en&s;e of the word. He is not free of the nation, in the &s;ame manner
<PB N="97" REF="110"> that a Frenchman is free of France, and an American of America. His rights are circum|&s;cribed to the town, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to the pari&s;h of his birth; and all other parts, though in his native land, are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m as a foreign country. To acquire a re&s;idence in the&s;e, he mu&s;t undergo a local naturalization by purcha&s;e, or he is for|bidden or expelled the place. This &s;pecies of feudality is kept up to aggrandize the corpora|tions at the ruin of towns; and the effect is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The generality of corporation towns are in a &s;tate of &s;olitary decay, and prevented from further ruin, only by &s;ome circum&s;tance in their &s;ituation, &s;uch as a navigable river, or a plentiful &s;urrounding country. As population is one of the chief &s;ources of wealth, (for without it land it&s;elf has no value,) every thing which operates to prevent it mu&s;t le&s;&s;en the value of property; and as corporations have not only this tendency, but directly this effect, they cannot but be injurious. If any policy were to be followed, in&s;tead of that of general freedom, to every per&s;on to &s;ettle where he cho&s;e, (as in France or America,) it would be more con&s;i&s;tent to give encouragement to new comers, than to preclude their admi&s;&s;ion by exacting premiums from them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to account for the origin of charter and cor|poration towns, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e them to have ari&s;en out of, or been connected with, &s;ome &s;pecies of garri&s;on &s;ervice. The times in which they began ju&s;tify this idea. The generality of tho&s;e towns have been garri&s;ons; and the corporations were charged with the care of the gates of the towns, when no mili|tary garri&s;on was pre&s;ent. Their refu&s;ing or granting admi&s;&s;ion to &s;trangers, which has produced the cu&s;tom of giving, &s;elling, and buying freedom, has more of the nature of garri&s;on au|thority than civil government. Soldiers are free of all corpo|rations throughout the nation, by the &s;ame propriety that every &s;oldier is free of every garri&s;on, and no other per&s;ons are. He can follow any employment, with the permi&s;&s;ion of his officers, in any corporation town throughout the nation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="111">The per&s;ons mo&s;t immediately intere&s;ted in the abolition of corporations, are the inhabitants of the towns where corporations are e&s;tabli&s;hed. The in&s;tances of Manche&s;ter, Birmingham, and Sheffield, &s;hew, by contra&s;t, the injury which tho&s;e Gothic in&s;titutions are to property and com|merce. A few examples may be found, &s;uch as that of London, who&s;e natural and commercial advantage, owing to its &s;ituation on the Thames, is capable of bearing up again&s;t the political evils of a corporation; but in almo&s;t all other ca&s;es the fatality is too vi&s;ible to be doubted or denied.</P>
<P>Though the whole nation is not &s;o directly affected by the depre&s;&s;ion of property in corpora|tion towns as the inhabitants them&s;elves, it par|takes of the con&s;equence. By le&s;&s;ening the value of property, the quantity of national commerce is curtailed. Every man is a cu&s;tomer in propor|tion to his ability; and as all parts of a nation trade with each other, whatever affects any of
<PB N="99" REF="112"> the parts, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily communicate to the whole.</P>
<P>As one of the hou&s;es of the Engli&s;h parlia|ment is, in a great mea&s;ure, made up of elections from the&s;e corporations; and as it is unnatural that a pure &s;tream &s;hould flow from a foul foun|tain, its vices are but a continuation of the vices of its origin. A man of moral honour and good political principles, cannot &s;ubmit to the mean drudgery and di&s;graceful arts, by which &s;uch elections are carried. To be a &s;ucce&s;sful candi|date, he mu&s;t be de&s;titute of the qualities that con|&s;titute a ju&s;t legi&s;lator: and being thus di&s;ciplined to corruption by the mode of entering into parlia|ment, it is not to be expected that the repre&s;en|tative &s;hould be better than the man.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in &s;peaking of the Engli&s;h repre|&s;entation, has advanced as bold a challenge as ever was given in the days of chivalry. <Q>Our repre&s;entation,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>has been found <HI>perfectly adequate to all the purpo&s;es</HI> for which a repre&s;entation of the people can be de&s;ired or devi&s;ed. I defy,</Q> continues he, <Q>the enemies of our con&s;titution to &s;hew the contrary.</Q>&mdash; This declaration from a man, who has been in con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to all the mea&s;ures of parlia|ment the whole of his political life, a year or two excepted, is mo&s;t extraordinary; and, comparing him with him&s;elf, admits of no other alter|native, than that he acted again&s;t his judgment as a member, or has declared contrary to it as an author.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113">But it is not in the repre&s;entation only that the defects lie, and therefore I proceed in the next place to the ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>What is called the Hou&s;e of Peers, is con&s;ti|tuted on a ground very &s;imilar to that, again&s;t which there is a law in other ca&s;es. It amounts to a combination of per&s;ons in one common intere&s;t. No rea&s;on can be given, why an hou&s;e of legi&s;lation &s;hould be compo&s;ed entirely of men who&s;e occupation con&s;i&s;ts in letting landed pro|perty, than why it &s;hould be compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who hire, or of brewers, or bakers, or any other &s;eparate cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke calls this hou&s;e, <Q>the great ground and pillar of &s;ecurity to the landed intere&s;t.</Q> Let us examine this idea.</P>
<P>What pillar of &s;ecurity does the landed intere&s;t require more than any other intere&s;t in the &s;tate, or what right has it to a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate repre&s;entation from the general intere&s;t of a nation? The only u&s;e to be made of this power, (and which it has always made,) is to ward off taxes from it&s;elf, and throw the burthen upon &s;uch articles of con&s;umption by which it&s;elf would be lea&s;t affected.</P>
<P>That this has been the con&s;equence, (and will always be the con&s;equence of con&s;tructing govern|ments on combinations,) is evident with re&s;pect to England, from the hi&s;tory of its taxes.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding taxes have encrea&s;ed and mul|tiplied upon every article of common con&s;ump|tion,
<PB N="101" REF="114"> the land-tax, which more particularly affects this "pillar," has dimini&s;hed. In 1788, the amount of the land-tax was 1,950,000 &pound;. which is half a million le&s;s than it produced almo&s;t an hundred years ago <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue. The land-tax in 1646 was &pound; 2,473,499.</NOTE>, notwith&s;tanding the rentals are in many in&s;tances doubled &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>Before the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly equal proportions between the land and articles of con&s;umption, the land bearing rather the large&s;t &s;hare: but &s;ince that aera, nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon con&s;umption. The con&s;equence of which has been a con&s;tant encrea&s;e in the number and wretchedne&s;s of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here again the burthen does not fall in equal proportions on the ari&s;tocracy with the re&s;t of the community. Their re&s;idences, whether in town or country, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart from di&s;tre&s;s, and the expence of relieving it. It is in manufac|turing towns and labouring villages that tho&s;e burthens pre&s;s the heavie&s;t; in many of which it is one cla&s;s of poor &s;upporting another.</P>
<P>Several of the mo&s;t heavy and productive taxes are &s;o contrived, as to give an exemption to this pillar, thus &s;tanding in its own defence. The tax upon beer brewed for &s;ale does not affect the ari|&s;tocracy,
<PB N="102" REF="115"> who brew their own beer free of this duty. It falls only on tho&s;e who have not con|veniency or ability to brew, and who mu&s;t pur|cha&s;e it in &s;mall quantities. But what will man|kind think of the ju&s;tice of taxation, when they know, that this tax alone, from which the ari|&s;tocracy are from circum&s;tances exempt, is nearly equal to the whole of the land-tax, being in the year 1788, and it is not le&s;s now, 1,666,152 &pound;. and with its proportion of the taxes on malt and hops, it exceeds it.&mdash;That a &s;ingle article, thus partially con&s;umed, and that chiefly by the work|ing part, &s;hould be &s;ubject to a tax, equal to that on the whole rental of a nation, is, perhaps, a fact not to be paralleled in the hi&s;tories of revenues.</P>
<P>This is one of the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from an hou&s;e of legi&s;lation, compo&s;ed on the ground of a combination of common intere&s;t; for what|ever their &s;eparate politics as to parties may be, in this they are united. Whether a combination acts to rai&s;e the price of any article for &s;ale, or the rate of wages; or whether it acts to throw taxes from it&s;elf upon another cla&s;s of the com|munity, the principle and the effect are the &s;ame; and if the one be illegal, it will be difficult to &s;hew that the other ought to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is to no u&s;e to &s;ay, that taxes are fir&s;t propo&s;ed in the hou&s;e of commons; for as the other hou&s;e has always a negative, it can always defend it&s;elf; and it would be ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e that its acquie&s;cence in the mea&s;ures to be propo&s;ed were not under&s;tood before hand. Be&s;ides which, it
<PB N="103" REF="116"> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o much influence by borough-traffic, and &s;o many of its relations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> connec|tions are di&s;tributed on both &s;ides of the com|mons, as to give it, be&s;ides an ab&s;olute negative in one hou&s;e, a preponderancy in the other, in all matters of common concern.</P>
<P>It is difficult to di&s;cover what is meant by the <HI>landed intere&s;t,</HI> if it does not mean a combination of ari&s;tocratical land-holders, oppo&s;ing their own pecuniary intere&s;t to that of the farmer, and every branch of trade, commerce, and manufacture. In all other re&s;pects it is the only intere&s;t that needs no partial protection. It enjoys the general protection of the world. Every individual, high or low, is intere&s;ted in the fruits of the earth; men, women, and children, of all ages and degrees, will turn out to a&s;&s;i&s;t the farmer, rather than a harve&s;t &s;hould not be got in; and they will not act thus by any other property. It is the only one for which the common prayer of man|kind is put up, and the only one that can never fail from the want of means. It is the intere&s;t, not of the policy, but of the exi&s;tence of man, and when it cea&s;es he mu&s;t cea&s;e to be.</P>
<P>No other intere&s;t in a nation &s;tands on the &s;ame united &s;upport. Commerce, manufactures, arts, &s;ciences, and every thing el&s;e, compared with this, are &s;upported but in parts. Their pro&s;perity or their decay has not the &s;ame uni|ver&s;al influence. When the vallies laugh and
<PB N="104" REF="117"> &s;ing, it is not the farmer only, but all creation that rejoices. It is a pro&s;perity that excludes all envy; and this cannot be &s;aid of any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Why then does Mr. Burke talk of his hou&s;e of peers, as the pillar of the landed intere&s;t? Were that pillar to &s;ink into the earth, the &s;ame landed property would continue, and the &s;ame plough|ing, &s;owing, and reaping would go on. The ari&s;tocracy are not the farmers who work the land, and rai&s;e the produce, but are the mere con&s;umers of the rent; and when compared with the active world, are the drones, a &s;eraglio of males, who neither collect the honey nor form the hive, but exi&s;t only for lazy enjoyment.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, called ari&s;tocracy, <HI>"the Corinthian capital of poli&s;hed &s;ociety."</HI> To|wards compleating the figure, he has now added the <HI>pillar;</HI> but &s;till the ba&s;e is wanting; and whenever a nation chu&s;es to act a Sam&s;on, not blind, but bold, down go the temple of Dagon, the Lords and the Phili&s;tines.</P>
<P>If a hou&s;e of legi&s;lation is to be compo&s;ed of men of one cla&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of protecting a di&s;tinct intere&s;t, all the other intere&s;ts &s;hould have the &s;ame. The inequality, as well as the burthen of taxation, ari&s;es from admitting it in one ca&s;e, and not in all. Had there been an hou&s;e of farmers, there had been no game laws; or an hou&s;e of merchants and manufacturers, the taxes had neither been &s;o unequal nor &s;o exce&s;|&s;ive. It is from the power of taxation being in
<PB N="105" REF="118"> the hands of tho&s;e who can throw &s;o great a part of it from their own &s;houlders, that it has raged without a check.</P>
<P>Men of &s;mall or moderate e&s;tates, are more injured by the taxes being thrown on articles of con&s;umption, than they are ea&s;ed by warding it from landed property, for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They con&s;ume more of the productive taxable articles, in proportion to their property, than tho&s;e of large e&s;tates.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their re&s;idence is chiefly in towns, and their property in hou&s;es; and the encrea&s;e of the poor-rates, occa&s;ioned by taxes on con&s;ump|tion, is in much greater proportion than the land-tax has been favoured. In Birmingham, the poor-rates are not le&s;s than &s;even &s;hillings in the pound. From this, as is already ob&s;erved, the ari&s;tocracy are in a great mea&s;ure exempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e are but a part of the mi&s;chiefs flowing from the wretched &s;cheme of an hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>As a combination, it can always throw a con|&s;iderable portion of taxes from it&s;elf; and as an hereditary hou&s;e, accountable to nobody, it re&s;embles a rotten borough, who&s;e con&s;ent is to be courted by intere&s;t. There are but few of its members, who are not in &s;ome mode or other participaters, or di&s;po&s;ers of the public money. One turns a candle-holder, or a lord in waiting; another a lord of the bed-chamber, a groom of the &s;tole, or any in&s;ignificant nominal office, to which a &s;alary is annexed, paid out of the public
<PB N="106" REF="119"> taxes, and which avoids the direct appearance of corruption. Such &s;ituations are derogatory to the character of man; and where they can be &s;ubmitted to, honour cannot re&s;ide.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e are to be added the numerous dependants, the long li&s;t of younger branches and di&s;tant relations, who are to be provided for at the public expence: in &s;hort, were an e&s;tima|tion to be made of the charge of ari&s;tocracy to a nation, it will be found nearly equal to that of &s;upporting the poor. The Duke of Richmond alone (and there are ca&s;es &s;imilar to his) takes away as much for him&s;elf as would maintain two thou&s;and poor and aged per&s;ons. Is it, then, any wonder, that under &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of government, taxes and rates have multiplied to their pre&s;ent extent?</P>
<P>In &s;tating the&s;e matters, I &s;peak an open and di&s;intere&s;ted language, dictated by no pa&s;&s;ion but that of humanity. To me, who have not only refu&s;ed offers, becau&s;e I thought them improper, but have declined rewards I might with reputa|tion have accepted, it is no wonder that meanne&s;s and impo&s;ition appear di&s;gu&s;tful. Independence is my happine&s;s, and I view things as they are, without regard to place or per&s;on; my country is the world, and my religion is to do good.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in &s;peaking of the ari&s;tocratical law of primogeniture, &s;ays, <Q>it is the &s;tanding law of our landed inheritance; and which, without que&s;tion, has a tendency, and I think,</Q>
<PB N="107" REF="120"> continues he, <Q>a happy tendency, to pre&s;erve a character of weight and con&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke may call this law what he plea&s;es, but humanity and impartial reflection will de|nounce it a law of brutal inju&s;tice. Were we not accu&s;tomed to the daily practice, and did we only hear of it as the law of &s;ome di&s;tant part of the world, we &s;hould conclude that the legi&s;lators of &s;uch countries had not yet arrived at a &s;tate of civilization.</P>
<P>As to its pre&s;erving a character of <HI>weight and con&s;equence,</HI> the ca&s;e appears to me directly the rever&s;e. It is an attaint upon character; a &s;ort of privateering on family property. It may have weight among dependent tenants, but it gives none on a &s;cale of national, and, much le&s;s of univer&s;al character. Speaking for my&s;elf, my parents were not able to give me a &s;hilling, beyond what they gave me in education; and to do this they di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves: yet, I po&s;&s;e&s;s more of what is called con&s;equence, in the world, than any one in Mr. Burke's catalogue of ari|&s;tocrats.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at &s;ome of the defects of the two hou&s;es of parliament, I proceed to what is called the crown upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;ignifies a nominal office of a million &s;terling a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in receiving the money. Whether the per&s;on be wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every mini&s;try acts upon the &s;ame
<PB N="108" REF="121"> idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people mu&s;t be hood-winked, and held in &s;uper|&s;titious ignorance by &s;ome bugbear or other; and what is called the crown an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, and therefore it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es to be expected from it. This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches.</P>
<P>The hazard to which this office is expo&s;ed in all countries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation&mdash;the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>It has been cu&s;tomary to call the crown the executive power, and the cu&s;tom is continued, though the rea&s;on has cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was called the <HI>executive,</HI> becau&s;e the per&s;on whom it &s;ignified u&s;ed, formerly, to &s;it in the character of a judge, in admini&s;tering or execut|ing the laws. The tribunals were then a part of the court. The power, therefore, which is now called the judicial, is what was called the execu|tive; and, con&s;equently, one or other of the terms is redundant, and one of the offices u&s;ele&s;s. When we &s;peak of the crown now, it means nothing; it &s;ignifies neither a judge nor a general: be&s;ides which it is the laws that govern, and not the man. The old terms are kept up, to give an appearance of con&s;equence to empty forms; and the only effect they have is that of increa&s;ing expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the means of rendering governments more conducive to the general
<PB N="109" REF="122"> happine&s;s of mankind, than they are at pre&s;ent, it will not be improper to take a review of the progre&s;s of taxation in England.</P>
<P>It is a general idea, that when taxes are once laid on, they are never taken off. However true this may have been of late, it was not always &s;o. Either, therefore, the people of former times were more watchful over government than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent, or government was admini&s;tered with le&s;s extravagance.</P>
<P>It is now &s;even hundred years &s;ince the Norman conque&s;t, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of what is called the crown. Taking this portion of time in &s;even &s;eparate periods of one hundred years each, the amount of the annual taxes, at each period, will be as follows:&mdash;

<P>The difference between the fir&s;t four hundred years and the la&s;t three, is &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, as to warrant an opinion, that the national character of the Engli&s;h has changed. It would have been
<PB N="111" REF="124"> impo&s;&s;ible to have dragooned the former Engli&s;h, into the exce&s;s of taxation that now exi&s;ts; and when it is con&s;idered that the pay of the army, the navy, and of all the revenue-officers, is the &s;ame now as it was above a hundred years ago, when the taxes were not above a tenth part of what they are at pre&s;ent, it appears impo&s;&s;ible to account for the enormous increa&s;e and expen|diture, on any other ground, than extravagance, corruption, and intrigue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Several of the court new&s;papers have of late made fre|quent mention of Wat Tyler. That his memory &s;hould be traduced by court &s;ycophants, and all tho&s;e who live on the &s;poil of a public, is not to be wondered at. He was, however, the means of checking the rage and inju&s;tice of taxation in his time, and the nation owed much to his valour. The hi&s;tory is conci&s;ely this:&mdash;In the time of Richard the &s;econd, a poll-tax was levied, of one &s;hilling per head, upon every per&s;on in the nation, of whatever e&s;tate or condition, on poor as well as rich, above the age of fifteen years. If any favour was &s;hewn in the law, it was to the rich rather than to the poor; as no per&s;on could be charged more than twenty &s;hillings for him&s;elf, family, and &s;ervants, though ever &s;o numerous; while all other families, under the number of twenty, were charged per head. Poll-taxes had always been odious; but this being al&s;o oppre&s;|&s;ive and unju&s;t, it excited, as it naturally mu&s;t, univer&s;al dete&s;|tation among the poor and middle cla&s;&s;es. The per&s;on known by the name of Wat Tyler, who&s;e proper name was Walter, and a tyler by trade, lived at Deptford. The gatherer of the poll-tax, on coming to his hou&s;e, demanded tax for one of his daughters, whom Tyler declared was under the age of fifteen. The tax-gatherer in&s;i&s;ted on &s;atisfying him&s;elf, and began an indecent examination of the girl, which enraging the father, he &s;truck him with a hammer, that brought him to the ground, and was the cau&s;e of his death.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance &s;erved to bring the di&s;contents to an i&s;&s;ue. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Tyler, who, in a few days was joined, according to &s;ome hi&s;tories, by upwards of fifty thou&s;and men, and cho&s;en their chief. With this force he marched to London, to demand an abolition of the tax, and a redre&s;s of other grievances. The court, finding it&s;elf in a forlorn condition, and unable to make re&s;i&s;tance, agreed, with Richard at its head, to hold a conference with Tyler in Smithfield, making many fair profe&s;&s;ions, courtier like, of its di&s;po&s;itions to redre&s;s the oppre&s;&s;ions. While Richard and Tyler were in conver&s;ation on the&s;e matters, each being on hor&s;eback, Walworth, then mayor of London, and one of the creatures of the court, watched an opportunity, and like a cowardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;tabbed Tyler with a dagger; and two or three others falling upon him, he was in&s;tantly &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>Tyler appears to have been an intrepid di&s;intere&s;ted man, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf. All his propo&s;als made to Richard, were on a more ju&s;t and public ground, than tho&s;e which had been made to John by the Barons; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ycophancy of hi&s;torians, and men like Mr. Burke, who &s;eek to glo&s;s over a ba&s;e action of the court by traducing Tyler, his fame will outlive their fal&s;ehood. If the Barons merited a monument to be erected in Runnymede, Tyler merits one in Smithfield.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>As to the national debt, however heavy the intere&s;t may be in taxes; yet, as it &s;erves to keep alive a capital, u&s;eful to commerce, it balances by its effects a con&s;iderable part of its own weight; and as the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in England is, by &s;ome means or other, &s;hort of its proper proportion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foreign intrigue, foreign wars, and foreign dominions, will in a great mea&s;ure account for the deficiency.</NOTE>, (being not more than twenty mil|lions, whereas it &s;hould be &s;ixty,) it would, be&s;ides the inju&s;tice, be bad policy to extingui&s;h a capital that &s;erves to &s;upply that defect. But with re&s;pect to the current expence, whatever is &s;aved therefrom is gain. The exce&s;s may &s;erve to keep corruption alive, but it has no re-action on credit and commerce, like the intere&s;t of the debt.</P>
<P>It is now very probable, that the Engli&s;h go|vernment (I do not mean the nation) is un|friendly to the French revolution. Whatever &s;erves to expo&s;e the intrigue and le&s;&s;en the influence of courts, by le&s;&s;ening taxation, will be unwelcome to tho&s;e who feed upon the &s;poil. Whil&s;t the clamour of French intrigue, arbitrary power, popery, and wooden &s;hoes could be kept up, the nation was ea&s;ily allured and alarmed into taxes. Tho&s;e days are now pa&s;t; deception, it is to be hoped, has reaped its la&s;t harve&s;t, and better times are in pro&s;pect for both countries, and for the world.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="129">Taking it for granted, that an alliance may be formed between England, France, and America, for the purpo&s;es hereafter to be mentioned, the national expences of France and England may con|&s;equently be le&s;&s;ened. The &s;ame fleets and armies will no longer be nece&s;&s;ary to either, and the reduction can be made &s;hip for &s;hip on each &s;ide. But to accompli&s;h the&s;e objects, the governments mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be fitted to a common and cor|re&s;pondent principle.

<P>The&s;e matters admitted, the national expences might be put back, <HI>for the &s;ake of a precedent,</HI> to what they were at &s;ome period when France and England were not enemies. This, con&s;equently, mu&s;t be prior to the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o to the revolution of 1688 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I happened to be in England at the celebration of the cen|tenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always appeared to me dete&s;table; the one &s;eek|ing to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of power them&s;elves; yet, as the nation was di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that event, I felt hurt at &s;eeing it a&s;cribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had under|taken it as a jobb, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Fir&s;t acted the &s;ame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds over and above his pay as king; and having thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern it&s;elf, is governed as a jobb. England has been the prey of jobbs ever &s;ince the revolution.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t in&s;tance
<PB N="117" REF="130"> that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, antecedent to tho&s;e dates, is in the very wa&s;teful and profligate times of Charles the Second; at which time England and France acted as allies.

<P>Even this &s;um is &s;ix times greater than the ex|pences of government are in America, yet the civil internal government in England, (I mean that admini&s;tered by means of quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions, juries, and a&s;&s;ize, and which, in fact, is nearly the whole, and performed by the nation,) is le&s;s expence upon the revenue, than the &s;ame &s;pecies and portion of government is in America.</P>
<P>It is time that nations &s;hould be rational, and not be governed like animals, for the plea&s;ure of their riders. To read the hi&s;tory of kings, a man would be almo&s;t inclined to &s;uppo&s;e that government con&s;i&s;ted in &s;tag-hunting, and that every nation paid a million a year to a hunt&s;man. Man ought to have pride, or &s;hame enough to blu&s;h at being thus impo&s;ed upon, and when he
<PB N="119" REF="132"> feel his proper character, he will. Upon all &s;ub|jects of this nature, there is often pa&s;&s;ing in the mind, a train of ideas he has not yet accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to encourage and communicate. Re|&s;trained by &s;omething that puts on the character of prudence, he acts the hypocrite upon him&s;elf as well as to others. It is, however, curious to ob&s;erve how &s;oon this &s;pell can be di&s;&s;olved. A &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, boldly conceived and uttered, will &s;ometimes put a whole company into their proper feelings; and whole nations are acted upon in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>As to the offices of which any civil government may be compo&s;ed, it matters but little by what names they are de&s;cribed. In the rotine of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as before ob&s;erved, whether a man be &s;tiled a pre&s;ident, a king, an emperor, a &s;enator, or any thing el&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;ervice he can perform, can merit from a nation more than ten thou&s;and pounds a year; and as no man &s;hould be paid beyond his &s;ervices, &s;o every man of a proper heart will not accept more. Public money ought to be touched with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of honour. It is not the produce of riches only, but of the hard earnings of labour and poverty. It is drawn even from the bitterne&s;s of want and mi&s;ery. Not a beggar pa&s;&s;es, or peri&s;hes in the &s;treets, who&s;e mite is not in that ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible that the Congre&s;s of America, could be &s;o lo&s;t to their duty, and to the intere&s;t of their con&s;tituents, as to offer General Wa&s;hing|ton,
<PB N="120" REF="133"> as pre&s;ident of America, a million a year, he would not, and he could not, accept it. His &s;en&s;e of honour is of another kind. It has co&s;t England almo&s;t &s;eventy millions &s;terling, to maintain a family imported from abroad, of very inferior capacity to thou&s;ands in the nation; and &s;carcely a year has pa&s;&s;ed that has not produced &s;ome new mercenary application. Even the phy|&s;icians bills have been &s;ent to the public to be paid. No wonder that jails are crowded, and taxes and poor-rates encrea&s;ed. Under &s;uch &s;y&s;tems, nothing is to be looked for but what has already happened; and as to reformation, when|ever it come, it mu&s;t be from the nation, and not from the goverment.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds is more than &s;ufficient to defray all the expences of government, exclu&s;ive of navies and armies, the following e&s;timate is added for any country, of the &s;ame extent as England.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, three hundred repre&s;enta|tives, fairly elected, are &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es to which legi&s;lation can apply, and preferable to a larger number. They may be divided into two or three hou&s;es, or meet in one, as in France, or in any manner a con&s;titution &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>As repre&s;entation is always con&s;idered, in free countries, as the mo&s;t honourable of all &s;tations, the allowance made to it is merely to defray the expence which the repre&s;entatives incur by that &s;ervice, and not to it as an office.</P>

<P>If a nation chu&s;e, it can deduct four <HI>per cent.</HI> from all offices, and make one of twenty thou&s;and <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>All revenue officers are paid out of the monies they collect, and therefore, are not in this e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The foregoing is not offered as an exact detail of offices, but to &s;hew the number and rate of &s;alaries which five hundred thou&s;and pounds will &s;upport; and it will, on experience, be found impracticable to find bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify even this expence. As to the manner in which
<PB N="122" REF="135"> office bu&s;ine&s;s is now performed, the Chiefs, in &s;everal offices, &s;uch as the po&s;t-office, and cer|tain offices in the exchequer, &amp;c. do little more than &s;ign their names three or four times a year; and the whole duty is performed by under clerks.</P>
<P>Taking, therefore, one million and an half as a &s;ufficient peace e&s;tabli&s;hment for all the hone&s;t purpo&s;es of government, which is three hundred thou&s;and pounds more than the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in the profligate and prodigal times of Charles the Second, (notwith&s;tanding, as has been already ob&s;erved, the pay and &s;alaries of the army, navy, and revenue officers, continue the &s;ame as at that period,) there will remain a &s;urplus of up|wards of &s;ix millions out of the pre&s;ent current ex|pences. The que&s;tion then will be, how to di&s;|po&s;e of this &s;urplus.</P>
<P>Whoever has ob&s;erved the manner in which trade and taxes twi&s;t them&s;elves together, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparating them &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Becau&s;e the articles now on hand are already charged with the duty, and the reduction cannot take place on the pre&s;ent &s;tock.</P>
<P>Secondly. Becau&s;e, on all tho&s;e articles on which the duty is charged in the gro&s;s, &s;uch as <HI>per</HI> barrel, hog&s;head, hundred weight, or tun, the abolition of the duty does not admit of being divided down &s;o as fully to relieve the con&s;umer, who purcha&s;es by the pint, or the pound. The la&s;t duty laid on &s;trong beer and ale, was three
<PB N="123" REF="136"> &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> barrel, which, if taken off, would le&s;&s;en the purcha&s;e only half a farthing <HI>per</HI> pint, and con&s;equently, would not reach to practical relief.</P>
<P>This being the condition of a great part of the taxes, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look for &s;uch others as are free from this embarra&s;&s;ment, and where the relief will be direct and vi&s;ible, and capable of immediate operation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, the poor-rates are a direct tax which every hou&s;e-keeper feels, and who knows al&s;o, to a farthing, the &s;um which he pays. The national amount of the whole of the poor rates is not po&s;itively known, but can be procured. Sir John Sinclair, in his Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, has &s;tated it at &pound;. 2,100,587. A con&s;iderable part of which is expended in litiga|tions, in which the poor, in&s;tead of being relieved, are tormented. The expence, however, is the &s;ame to the pari&s;h from whatever cau&s;e it ari&s;es.</P>
<P>In Birmingham, the amount of the poor-rates is fourteen thou&s;and pounds a year. This, though a large &s;um, is moderate, compared with the population. Birmingham is &s;aid to contain &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;ouls, and on a proportion of &s;eventy thou&s;and to fourteen thou&s;and pounds poor-rates, the national amount of poor-rates, taking the population of England at &s;even mil|lions, would be but one million four hundred thou|&s;and pounds. It is, therefore, mo&s;t probable, that the population of Birmingham is over-rated.
<PB N="124" REF="137"> Fourteen thou&s;and pounds is the proportion upon fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls, taking two millions of poor-rates as the national amount.</P>
<P>Be it, however, what it may, it is no other than the con&s;equence of the exce&s;&s;ive burthen of taxes, for, at the time when the taxes were very low, the poor were able to maintain them&s;elves; and there were no poor-rates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poor-rates began about the time of Henry the Eighth, when the taxes began to encrea&s;e, and they have encrea&s;ed as the taxes encrea&s;ed ever &s;ince.</NOTE>. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, a labouring man, with a wife and two or three children, does not pay le&s;s than be|tween &s;even and eight pounds a year in taxes. He is not &s;en&s;ible of this, becau&s;e it is di&s;gui&s;ed to him in the articles which he buys, and he thinks only of their dearne&s;s; but as the taxes take from him, at lea&s;t, a fourth part of his yearly earnings, he is con&s;equently di&s;abled from providing for a family, e&s;pecially, if him&s;elf, or any of them, are afflicted with &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep, therefore, of practical relief, would be to aboli&s;h the poor-rates entirely, and in lieu thereof, to make a remi&s;&s;ion of taxes to the poor of double the amount of the pre&s;ent poor-rates, viz. four millions annually out of the &s;urplus taxes. By this mea&s;ure, the poor would be benefited two millions, and the hou&s;e-keepers two millions. This alone would be equal to a reduction of one hundred and twenty millions of the national
<PB N="125" REF="138"> debt, and con&s;equently equal to the whole expence of the American war.</P>
<P>It will then remain to be con&s;idered, which is the mo&s;t effectual mode of di&s;tributing this remi&s;|&s;ion of four millions.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily &s;een, that the poor are generally compo&s;ed of large families of children, and old people pa&s;t their labour. If the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es are provided for, the remedy will &s;o far reach to the full extent of the ca&s;e, that what remains will be incidental, and, in a great mea&s;ure, fall within the compa&s;s of benefit clubs, which, though of hum|ble invention, merit to be ranked among the be&s;t of modern in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Admitting England to contain &s;even million of &s;ouls; if one-fifth thereof are of that cla&s;s of poor which need &s;upport, the number will be one mil|lion four hundred thou&s;and. Of this number, one hundred and forty thou&s;and will be aged poor, as will be hereafter &s;hewn, and for which a di&s;tinct provi&s;ion will be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>There will then remain one million two hun|dred and &s;ixty thou&s;and, which, at five &s;ouls to each family, amount to two hundred and fifty-two thou&s;and families, rendered poor from the ex|pence of children and the weight of taxes.</P>
<P>The number of children under fourteen years of age, in each of tho&s;e families, will be found to be about five to every two families; &s;ome having two, and others three; &s;ome one, and others four; &s;ome none, and others five; but it rarely happens
<PB N="126" REF="139"> that more than five are under fourteen years of age, and after this age they are capable of &s;ervice or of being apprenticed.</P>
<P>Allowing five children (under fourteen years) to every two families,

</TABLE></P>
<P>It is certain, that if the children are provided for, the parents are relieved of con&s;equence, becau&s;e it is from the expence of bringing up children that their poverty ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Having thus a&s;certained the greate&s;t number that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to need &s;upport on account of young families, I proceed to the mode of relief or di&s;tribution, which is,</P>
<P>To pay as a remi&s;&s;ion of taxes to every poor family, out of the &s;urplus taxes, and in room of poor-rates, four pounds a year for every child un|der fourteen years of age; enjoining the parents of &s;uch children to &s;end them to &s;chool, to learn read|ing, writing, and common arithmetic; the mini&s;|ters of every pari&s;h, of every denomination, to certify jointly to an office, for that purpo&s;e, that this duty is performed.</P>
<P><TABLE>

<CELL>&pound;. 2,520,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>By adopting this method, not only the poverty of the parents will be relieved, but ignorance will be bani&s;hed from the ri&s;ing generation, and the
<PB N="127" REF="140"> number of poor will hereafter become le&s;s, becau&s;e their abilities, by the aid of education, will be greater. Many a youth, with good natural genius, who is apprenticed to a mechanical trade, &s;uch as a carpenter, joiner, millwright, &s;hipwright, black|&s;mith, &amp;c. is prevented getting forward the whole of his life, from the want of a little common edu|cation when a boy.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the ca&s;e of the aged.</P>
<P>I divide age into two cla&s;&s;es. Fir&s;t, the ap|proach of age beginning at fifty. Secondly, old age commencing at &s;ixty.</P>
<P>At fifty, though the mental faculties of man are in full vigour, and his judgment better than at any preceeding date, the bodily powers for laborious life are on the decline. He cannot bear the &s;ame quantity of fatigue as at an earlier period. He begins to earn le&s;s, and is le&s;s capable of enduring wind and weather; and in tho&s;e more retired em|ployments where much &s;ight is required, he fails apace, and &s;ees him&s;elf, like an old hor&s;e, begin|ning to be turned adrift.</P>
<P>At &s;ixty his labour ought to be over, at lea&s;t from direct nece&s;&s;ity. It is painful to &s;ee old age working it&s;elf to death, in what are called civilized countries, for daily bread.</P>
<P>To form &s;ome judgment of the number of tho&s;e above fifty years of age, I have &s;everal times counted the per&s;ons I met in the &s;treets of London, men, women, and children, and have generally found that the average is about one in &s;ixteen or
<PB N="128" REF="141"> &s;eventeen. If it be &s;aid that aged per&s;ons do not come much in the &s;treets, &s;o neither do infants; and a great proportion of grown children are in &s;chools, and in work &s;hops as apprentices. Taking then &s;ixteen for a divi&s;or, the whole number of per&s;ons, in England, of fifty years and upwards of both &s;exes, rich and poor, will be four hundred and twenty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons to be provided for out of this gro&s;s number will be, hu&s;bandmen, common labourers, journeymen of every trade and their wives, &s;ailors, and di&s;banded &s;oldiers, worn out &s;ervants of both &s;exes, and poor widows.</P>
<P>There will be al&s;o a con&s;iderable number of middling trade&s;men, who having lived decently in the former part of life, begin, as age approaches, to lo&s;e their bu&s;ine&s;s, and at la&s;t fall to decay.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there will be con&s;tantly thrown off from the revolutions of that wheel, which no man can &s;top, nor regulate, a number from every cla&s;s of life connected with commerce and adventure.</P>
<P>To provide for all tho&s;e accidents, and what|ever el&s;e may befal, I take the number of per&s;ons, who at one time or other of their lives, after fifty years of age, may feel it nece&s;&s;ary or comfortable to be better &s;upported, than they can &s;upport them|&s;elves, and that not as a matter of grace and fa|vour, but of right, at one third of the whole num|ber, which is one hundred and forty thou&s;and, as &s;tated in page 125, and for whom a di&s;tinct pro|vi&s;ion was propo&s;ed to be made. If there be
<PB N="129" REF="142"> more, &s;ociety, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hew and pom|po&s;ity of government, is in a deplorable condition in England.</P>
<P>Of this one hundred and forty thou&s;and, I take one half, &s;eventy thou&s;and, to be of the age of fifty and under &s;ixty, and the other half to be &s;ixty years and upwards.&mdash;Having thus a&s;certained the probable proportion of the number of aged per|&s;ons, I proceed to the mode of rendering their condition comfortable, which is,</P>

<P>This &s;upport, as already remarked, is not of the nature of a charity, but of a right. Every per&s;on in England, male and female, pays on an average in taxes, two pounds eight &s;hillings and &s;ixpence <HI>per ann.</HI> from the day of his (or her) birth; and, if the expence of collection be added, he pays two pounds eleven &s;hillings and &s;ixpence; con|&s;equently, at the end of fifty years he has paid one hundred and twenty-eight pounds fifteen &s;hillings; and at &s;ixty, one hundred and fifty-four pounds ten &s;hillings. Converting, therefore, his (or her) in|dividual
<PB N="130" REF="143"> tax into a tontine, the money he &s;hall re|ceive after fifty years, is but little more than the legal intere&s;t of the nett money he has paid; the re&s;t is made up from tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances do not require them to draw &s;uch &s;upport, and the capital in both ca&s;es defrays the expences of go|vernment. It is on this ground that I have extend|ed the probable claims to one third of the number of aged per&s;ons in the nation.&mdash;Is it then better that the lives of one hundred and forty thou&s;and aged per&s;ons be rendered comfortable, or that a million a year o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> public money be expended on any one individual, and him often of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s or in&s;ignificant character?

Though all pay taxes in the articles they con&s;ume, all do not pay poor-rates. About two millions are ex|empted, &s;ome as not being hou&s;e-keepers, others as not being able, and the poor them&s;elves who receive the relief. The ave|rage, therefore, of poor-rates on the remaining number, is forty &s;hillings for every family of five per&s;ons, which makes the whole average amount of taxes and rates, 14<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> For &s;ix per|&s;ons. 17<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> For &s;even per&s;ons, 20<HI>l.</HI> 16<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>

<P>After all the above ca&s;es are provided for, there will &s;till be a number of families who, though not properly of the cla&s;s of poor, yet find it difficult to give education to their children; and &s;uch chil|dren, under &s;uch a ca&s;e, would be in a wor&s;e con|dition than if their parents were actually poor. A nation under a well regulated goverment, &s;hould permit none to remain unin&s;tructed. It is monar|chical and ari&s;tocratical government only that re|quires ignorance for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then four hundred thou&s;and children to be in this condition, which is a greater number
<PB N="132" REF="145"> than ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed, after the provi&s;ions already made, the method will be,</P>
<P>To allow for each of tho&s;e children ten &s;hillings a year for the expence of &s;chooling, for &s;ix years each, which will give them &s;ix months &s;chooling each year, and half a crown a year for paper and &s;pelling books.</P>
<P>The expence of this will be annually <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Public &s;chools do not an&s;wer the general purpo&s;e of the poor.

There are always per&s;ons of both &s;exes to be found in every village, e&s;pecially when growing into years, ca|pable of &s;uch an undertaking. Twenty children, at ten &s;hillings each, (and that not more than &s;ix months each year) would be as much as &s;ome livings amount to in the remote parts of England; and there are often di&s;tre&s;&s;ed clergymen's widows to whom &s;uch an income would be acceptable. Whatever is given on this ac|count to children an&s;wers two purpo&s;es, to them it is education, to tho&s;e who educate them it is a livelihood.</NOTE> &pound;250,000</P>
<P>There will then remain one hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great modes of relief which the be&s;t in&s;tituted and be&s;t principled government may devi&s;e, there will &s;till be a number of &s;maller ca&s;es, which it is good policy as well as beneficence in a nation to con&s;ider.</P>

<P>Al&s;o twenty thou&s;and pounds to be appropriated to defray the funeral expences of per&s;ons, who, travelling for work, may die at a di&s;tance from their friends. By relieving pari&s;hes from this charge, the &s;ick &s;tranger will be better treated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this part of the &s;ubject with a plan adapted to the particular condition of a metro|polis, &s;uch as London.</P>
<P>Ca&s;es are continually occurring in a metropolis different to tho&s;e which occur in the country, and for which a different, or rather an additional mode of relief is nece&s;&s;ary. In the country, even in large towns, people have a knowledge of each other, and di&s;tre&s;s never ri&s;es to that extreme height it &s;ometimes does in a metropolis. There is no &s;uch thing in the country as per&s;ons, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;tarved to death, or dying with cold from the want of a lodging. Yet &s;uch ca&s;es, and others equally as mi&s;erable, happen in London.</P>
<P>Many a youth comes up to London full of ex|pectations, and with little or no money, and un|le&s;s he gets immediate employment he is already
<PB N="134" REF="147"> half undone; and boys bred up in London with|out any means of a livelihood, and as it often hap|pens of di&s;&s;olute parents, are in a &s;till wor&s;e con|dition; and &s;ervants long out of place are not much better off. In &s;hort, a world of little ca&s;es are continually ari&s;ing, which bu&s;y or affluent life knows not of, to open the fir&s;t door to di&s;tre&s;s. Hunger is not among the po&s;tponeable wants, and a day, even a few hours, in &s;uch a condition, is often the cri&s;is of a life of ruin.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, which are the general cau&s;e of the little thefts and pilferings that lead to greater, may be prevented. There yet remain twenty thou&s;and pounds out of the four millions of &s;urplus taxes, which, with another fund here|after to be mentioned, amounting to about twenty thou&s;and pounds more, cannot be better applied than to this purpo&s;e. The plan then will be,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To erect two or more buildings, or take &s;ome already erected, capable of containing at lea&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons, and to have in each of the&s;e places as many kinds of employment as can be contrived, &s;o that every per&s;on who &s;hall come may find &s;omething which he or &s;he can do.</P>
<P>Secondly, To receive all who &s;hall come, with|out enquiring who or what they are. The only condition to be, that for &s;o much, or &s;o many hours work, each per&s;on &s;hall receive &s;o many meals of whole&s;ome food, and a warm lodging, at lea&s;t as good as a barrack. That a certain portion of what each per&s;on's work &s;hall be worth &s;hall be re&s;erved,
<PB N="135" REF="148"> and given to him, or her, on their going away; and that each per&s;on &s;hall &s;tay as long, or as &s;hort time, or come as often as he chu&s;e, on the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P>If each per&s;on &s;taid three months, it would a&s;&s;i&s;t by rotation twenty-four thou&s;and per&s;ons annually, though the real number, at all times, would be but &s;ix thou&s;and. By e&s;tabli&s;hing an a&s;ylum of this kind, &s;uch per&s;ons to whom temporary di&s;tre&s;&s;es occur, would have an opportunity to recruit them|&s;elves, and be enabled to look out for better em|ployment.</P>
<P>Allowing that their labour paid but one half the expence of &s;upporting them, after re&s;erving a por|tion of their earnings for them&s;elves, the &s;um of forty thou&s;and pounds additional would defray all other charges for even a greater number than &s;ix thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The fund very properly convertible to this pur|po&s;e, in addition to the twenty thou&s;and pounds, re|maining of the former fund, will be the produce of the tax upon coals, and &s;o iniquitou&s;ly and wantonly applied to the &s;upport of the Duke of Richmond. It is horrid that any man, more e&s;pecially at the price coals now are, &s;hould live on the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a community; and any government permitting &s;uch an abu&s;e, de&s;erves to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This fund is &s;aid to be about twenty thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="149">I &s;hall now conclude this plan with enumerating the &s;everal particulars, and then proceed to other matters.</P>
<P>The enumeration is as follows:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Abolition of two million poor-rates.</P>
<P>Secondly, Provi&s;ion for two hundred and fifty-two thou&s;and poor families.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Education for one million and thirty thou&s;and children.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Comfortable provi&s;ion for one hun|dred and forty thou&s;and aged per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Donation of twenty &s;hillings each for fifty thou&s;and births.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Donation of twenty &s;hillings each for twenty thou&s;and marriages.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Allowance of twenty thou&s;and pounds for the funeral expences of per&s;ons travelling for work, and dying at a di&s;tance from their friends.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Employment, at all times, for the ca|&s;ual poor in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, tho&s;e in&s;truments of civil torture, will be &s;uper|ceded, and the wa&s;teful expence of litigation prevent|ed. The hearts of the humane will not be &s;hocked by ragged and hungry children, and per&s;ons of &s;eventy and eighty years of age begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their la&s;t, as a repri&s;al of pari&s;h upon pari&s;h. Widows will have a maintenance for their children, and not be carted away, on the death of their hu&s;bands, like culprits and criminals;
<PB N="137" REF="150"> and children will no longer be con&s;idered as en|crea&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their parents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, becau&s;e it will be to their advantage, and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, will be le&s;&s;ened. The poor, as well as the rich, will then be intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of government, and the cau&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of riots and tumults will cea&s;e.&mdash;Ye who &s;it in ea&s;e, and &s;olace your&s;elves in plenty, and &s;uch there are in Turkey and Ru&s;&s;ia, as well as in England, and who &s;ay to your&s;elves, <Q>Are we not well off,</Q> have ye thought of the&s;e things? When ye do, ye will cea&s;e to &s;peak and feel for your&s;elves alone.</P>
<P>The plan is ea&s;y in practice. It does not em|barra&s;s trade by a &s;udden interruption in the order of taxes, but effects the relief by changing the ap|plication of them; and the money nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e can be drawn from the exci&s;e collections, which are made eight times a year in every market town in England.</P>
<P>Having now arranged and concluded this &s;ub|ject, I proceed to the next.</P>
<P>Taking the pre&s;ent current expences at &s;even millions and an half, which is the lea&s;t amount they are now at, there will remain (after the &s;um of one million and an half be taken for the new cur|rent expences, and four millions for the before-mentioned &s;ervice) the &s;um of two millions; part of which to be applied as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="151">Though fleets and armies, by an alliance with France, will, in a great mea&s;ure, become u&s;ele&s;s, yet the per&s;ons who have devoted them&s;elves to tho&s;e &s;ervices, and have thereby unfitted them&s;elves for other lines of life, are not to be &s;ufferers by the means that make others happy. They are a dif|ferent de&s;cription of men to tho&s;e who form or hang about a court.</P>
<P>A part of the army will remain at lea&s;t for &s;ome years, and al&s;o of the navy, for which a provi&s;ion is already made in the former part of this plan of one million, which is almo&s;t half a million more than the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army and navy in the prodigal times of Charles the Second.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then fifteen thou&s;and &s;oldiers to be di&s;|banded, and to allow to each of tho&s;e men three &s;hillings a week during life, clear of all deductions, to be paid in the &s;ame manner as the Chel&s;ea Col|lege pen&s;ioners are paid, and for them to return to their trades and their friends; and al&s;o to add fif|teen thou&s;and &s;ixpences per week to the pay of the &s;oldiers who &s;hall remain; the annual ex|pence will be,

As it falls in, a part of the taxes may be taken off; for in|&s;tance, when thirty thou&s;and pounds fall in the duty on hops may be wholly taken off; and as other parts fall in, the duties on candles and &s;oap may be le&s;&s;ened, till at la&s;t they will totally cea&s;e.</P>
<P>There now remains at lea&s;t one million and an half of &s;urplus taxes.</P>
<P>The tax on hou&s;es and windows is one of tho&s;e direct taxes, which, like the poor-rates, is not con|founded with trade; and, when taken off, the re|lief
<PB N="140" REF="153"> will be in&s;tantly felt. This tax falls heavy on the middling cla&s;s of people.</P>

<P>When taxes are propo&s;ed, the country is amu&s;ed by the plau&s;ible language of taxing luxuries. One thing is called a luxury at one time, and &s;ome|thing el&s;e at another; but the real luxury does not con&s;i&s;t in the article, but in the means of procur|ing it, and this is always kept out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>I know not why any plant or herb of the field &s;hould be a greater luxury in one country than ano|ther, but an overgrown e&s;tate in either is a luxury at all times, and as &s;uch is the proper object of taxation. It is, therefore, right to take tho&s;e kind tax-making gentlemen up on their own word, and argue on the principle them&s;elves have laid down, that of <HI>taxing luxuries.</HI> If they, or their champion Mr. Burke, who, I fear, is growing out of date like the man in armour, can prove that an e&s;tate of twenty, thirty, or forty thou&s;and pounds a year is not a luxury, I will give up the argument.</P>
<P>Admitting that any annual &s;um, &s;ay for in&s;tance, one thou&s;and pounds, is nece&s;&s;ary or &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a family, con&s;equently the &s;econd thou&s;and is of the nature of a luxury, the third &s;till more &s;o, and by proceeding on, we &s;hall at la&s;t arrive at a &s;um that may not improperly be called a prohibitable luxury. It would be impo|litic to &s;et bounds to property acquired by indu&s;try, and therefore it is right to place the prohibition
<PB N="142" REF="155"> beyond the probable acqui&s;ition to which indu&s;try can extend; but there ought to be a limit to pro|perty, or the accumulation of it, by beque&s;t. It &s;hould pa&s;s in &s;ome other line. The riche&s;t in every nation have poor relations, and tho&s;e often very near in con&s;anguinity.</P>
<P>The following table of progre&s;&s;ive taxation is con&s;tructed on the above principles, and as a &s;ub|&s;titute for the commutation tax. It will reach the point of prohibition by a regular operation, and thereby &s;upercede the ari&s;tocratical law of primo|geniture.</P>

<P><PB N="145" REF="158">At the twenty-third thou&s;and the tax becomes twenty &s;hillings in the pound, and con&s;equently every thou&s;and beyond that &s;um can produce no profit but by dividing the e&s;tate. Yet formidable as this tax appears, it will not, I believe, produce &s;o much as the commutation tax; &s;hould it pro|duce more, it ought to be lowered to that amount upon e&s;tates under two or three thou&s;and a year.</P>
<P>On &s;mall and middling e&s;tates it is lighter (as it is intended to be) than the commutation tax. It is not till after &s;even or eight thou&s;and a year that it begins to be heavy. The object is not &s;o much the produce of the tax, as the ju&s;tice of the mea|&s;ure. The ari&s;tocracy has &s;creened it&s;elf too much, and this &s;erves to re&s;tore a part of the lo&s;t equili|brium.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of its &s;creening it&s;elf, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to look back to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the exci&s;e laws, at what is called the Re&s;toration, or the coming of Charles the Second. The ari&s;|tocratical intere&s;t then in power, commuted the feudal &s;ervices it&s;elf was under by laying a tax on beer brewed for <HI>&s;ale;</HI> that is, they compounded with Charles for an exemption from tho&s;e &s;ervices for them&s;elves and their heirs, by a tax to be paid by other people. The ari&s;tocracy do not purcha&s;e beer brewed for &s;ale, but brew their own beer free of the duty, and if any commutation at that time were nece&s;&s;ary, it ought to have been at the expence of tho&s;e for whom the exemptions from tho&s;e &s;er|vices
<PB N="146" REF="159"> were intended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tax on beer brewed for &s;ale, from which the ari&s;tocracy are exempt, is almo&s;t one million more than the pre&s;ent commu|tation tax, being by the returns of 1788, 1,666,152<HI>l.</HI> and con|&s;equently they ought to take on them&s;elves the amount of the commutation tax, as they are already exempted from one which is almo&s;t one million greater.</NOTE>; in&s;tead of which it was thrown on an entire different cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>But the chief object of this progre&s;&s;ive tax (be|&s;ides the ju&s;tice of rendering taxes more equal than they are) is, as already &s;tated, to extirpate the overgrown influence ari&s;ing from the unnatural law of primogeniture, and which is one of the princi|pal &s;ources of corruption at elections.</P>
<P>It would be attended with no good con&s;equences to enquire how &s;uch va&s;t e&s;tates as thirty, forty, or fifty thou&s;and a year could commence, and that at a time when commerce and manufactures were not in a &s;tate to admit of &s;uch acqui&s;itions. Let it be &s;ufficient to remedy the evil by putting them in a condition of de&s;cending again to the community, by the quiet means of apportioning them among all the heirs and heire&s;&s;es of tho&s;e families. This will be the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e hitherto the ari&s;tocracy have quartered their younger children and connections upon the public i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;ele&s;s po&s;ts, places, and offices, which when aboli&s;hed will leave them de&s;titute, unle&s;s the law of primogeniture be al&s;o aboli&s;hed or &s;uperceded.</P>
<P>A progre&s;&s;ive tax will, in a great mea&s;ure, effect this object, and that as a matter of intere&s;t to the
<PB N="147" REF="160"> parties mo&s;t immediately concerned, as will be &s;een by the following table; which &s;hews the nett produce upon every e&s;tate, after &s;ubtracting the tax. By this it will appear, that after an e&s;tate ex|ceeds thirteen or fourteen thou&s;and a year, the re|mainder produces but little profit to the holder, and con&s;equently will pa&s;s either to the younger children, or to other kindred.</P>

<P>According to this table, an e&s;tate cannot pro|duce more then 12,3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0<HI>l.</HI> clear of the land tax and the progre&s;&s;ive tax, and therefore the dividing &s;uch e&s;tates will follow as a matter of family intere&s;t.

<P>Although an enquiry into the origin of tho&s;e e&s;tates be unnece&s;&s;ary, the continuation of them in their pre&s;ent &s;tate is another &s;ubject. It is a matter of national concern. As hereditary e&s;tates, the law has created the evil, and it ought al&s;o to provide the remedy. Primogeniture ought to be aboli&s;hed, not only becau&s;e it is unnatural and unju&s;t, but becau&s;e the country &s;uffers by its operation. By cutting off (as before ob&s;erved) the younger children from their proper portion of inheritance, the public is
<PB N="149" REF="162"> loaded with the expence of maintaining them; and the freedom of elections violated by the overbearing influence which this unju&s;t monopoly of family pro|perty produces. Nor is this all. It occa&s;ions a wa&s;te of national property. A con&s;iderable part of the land of the country is rendered unproduc|tive by the great extent of parks and cha&s;es which this law &s;erves to keep up, and this at a time when the annual production of grain is not equal to the national con&s;umption <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the reports on the corn trade</NOTE>.&mdash;In &s;hort, the evils of the ari&s;tocratical &s;y&s;tem are &s;o great and numerous, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with every thing that is ju&s;t, wi&s;e, natu|ral, and beneficent, that when they are con&s;idered, there ought not to be a doubt that many, who are now cla&s;&s;ed under that de&s;cription, will wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure can they derive from contemplat|ing the expo&s;ed condition, and almo&s;t certain beg|gary of their younger offspring? Every ari&s;tocra|tical family has an appendage of family beggars hanging round it, which in a few ages, or a few generations, are &s;hook off, and con&s;ole them&s;elves with telling their tale in alms-hou&s;es, work-hou&s;es, and pri&s;ons. This is the natural con&s;equence of ari&s;tocracy. The peer and the beggar are often of the &s;ame family. One extreme produces the other: to make one rich many mu&s;t be made poor; nei|ther can the &s;y&s;tem be &s;upported by other means.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="163">There are two cla&s;&s;es of people to whom the laws of England are particularly ho&s;tile, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t helple&s;s; younger children and the poor. Of the former I have ju&s;t &s;poken; of the latter I &s;hall mention one in&s;tance out of the many that might be produced, and with which I &s;hall clo&s;e this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Several laws are in exi&s;tence for regulating and limiting workmen's wages. Why not leave them as free to make their own bargains, as the law-makers are to let their farms and hou&s;es? Per|&s;onal labour is all the property they have. Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy to be infringed? But the inju&s;tice will appear &s;tronger, if we con&s;ider the operation and effect of &s;uch laws. When wages are fixed by what is called a law, the legal wages remain &s;tationary, while every thing el&s;e is in progre&s;&s;ion; and as tho&s;e who make that law, &s;till continue to lay on new taxes by other laws, they encrea&s;e the expence of living by one law, and take away the means by another.</P>
<P>But if tho&s;e gentlemen law-makers and tax-makers thought it right to limit the poor pittance which per&s;onal labour can produce, and on which a whole family is to be &s;upported, they certainly mu&s;t feel them&s;elves happily indulged in a limita|tion on their own part, of not le&s;s than twelve thou|&s;and a year, and that of property they never ac|quired, (nor probably any of their ance&s;tors) and of which they have made &s;o ill a u&s;e.</P>

<P>There yet remains, as already &s;tated, one mil|lion of &s;urplus taxes. Some part of this will be required for circum&s;tances that do not immediate|ly pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and &s;uch part as &s;hall not be wanted, will admit a further reduction of taxes equal to that amount.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="166">Among the claims that ju&s;tice requires to be made, the condition of the inferior revenue officers will merit attention. It is a reproach to any go|vernment to wa&s;te &s;uch an immen&s;ity of revenue in &s;inecures and nominal and unnece&s;&s;ary places and offices, and not allow even a decent livelihood to tho&s;e on whom the labour falls. The &s;alary of the inferior officers of the revenue has &s;tood at the petty pittance of le&s;s than fifty pounds a year for up|wards of one hundred years. It ought to be &s;e|venty. About one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds applied to this purpo&s;e, will put all tho&s;e &s;alaries in a decent condition.</P>
<P>This was propo&s;ed to be done almo&s;t twenty years ago, but the trea&s;ury-board then in being
<PB N="154" REF="167"> &s;tartled at it, as it might lead to &s;imilar expecta|tions from the army and navy; and the event was, that the King, or &s;omebody for him, applied to parliament to have his own &s;alary rai&s;ed an hun|dred thou&s;and a year, which being done, every thing el&s;e was laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to another cla&s;s of men, the infe|rior clergy, I forbear to enlarge on their condi|tion; but all partialities and prejudices for, or again&s;t, different modes and forms of religion a&s;ide, common ju&s;tice will determine, whether there ought to be an income of twenty or thirty pounds a year to one man, and of ten thou&s;and to another. I &s;peak on this &s;ubject with the more freedom, becau&s;e I am known not to be a Pre&s;byterian; and therefore the cant cry of court &s;ycophants, about church and meeting, kept up to amu&s;e and bewilder the nation, cannot be rai&s;ed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Ye &s;imple men, on both &s;ides the que&s;tion, do ye not &s;ee through this courtly craft? If ye can be kept di&s;puting and wrangling about church and meeting, ye ju&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of every cour|tier, who lives the while on the &s;poil of the taxes, and laughs at your credulity. Every religion is good that teaches man to be good; and I know of none that in&s;tructs him to be bad.</P>
<P>All the before-mentioned calculations, &s;uppo&s;e only &s;ixteen millions and an half of taxes paid into the exchequer, after the expence of collection and drawbacks at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and exci&s;e-office
<PB N="155" REF="168"> are deducted; whereas the &s;um paid into the ex|chequer is very nearly, if not quite, &s;eventeen mil|lions. The taxes rai&s;ed in Scotland and Ireland are expended in tho&s;e countries, and therefore their &s;avings will come out of their own taxes; but if any part be paid into the Engli&s;h exchequer, it might be remitted. This will not make one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year difference.</P>
<P>There now remains only the national debt to be con&s;idered. In the year 1789, the intere&s;t, exclu&s;ive of the tontine, was 9,150,138<HI>l.</HI> How much the capital has been reduced &s;ince that time the mini&s;ter be&s;t knows. But after paying the intere&s;t, aboli&s;hing the tax on hou&s;es and win|dows, the commutation tax, and the poor rates; and making all the provi&s;ions for the poor, for the education of children, the &s;upport of the aged, the di&s;banded part of the army and navy, and en|crea&s;ing the pay of the remainder, there will be a &s;urplus of one million.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;cheme of paying off the national debt appears to me, &s;peaking as an indifferent per&s;on, to be an ill-concerted, if not a fallacious job. The burthen of the national debt con&s;i&s;ts not in its being &s;o many millions, or &s;o many hun|dred millions, but in the quantity of taxes col|lected every year to pay the intere&s;t. If this quan|tity continue the &s;ame, the burthen of the na|tional debt is the &s;ame to all intents and purpo&s;es, be the capital more or le&s;s. The only knowledge
<PB N="156" REF="169"> which the public can have of the reduction of the debt, mu&s;t be through the reduction of taxes for paying the intere&s;t. The debt, therefore, is not reduced one farthing to the public by all the mil|lions that have been paid; and it would require more money now to purcha&s;e up the capital, than when the &s;cheme began.</P>
<P>Digre&s;&s;ing for a moment at this point, to which I &s;hall return again, I look back to the appoint|ment of Mr. Pitt, as mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I was then in America. The war was over; and though re&s;entment had cea&s;ed, memory was &s;till alive.</P>
<P>When the news of the coalition arrived, though it was a matter of no concern to me as a citizen of America, I felt it as a man. It had &s;omething in it which &s;hocked, by publicly &s;porting with de|cency, if not with principle. It was impudence in Lord North; it was want of firmne&s;s in Mr. Fox.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was, at that time, what may be called a maiden character in politics. So far from being hackneyed, he appeared not to be initiated into the fir&s;t my&s;teries of court intrigue. Every thing was in his favour. Re&s;entment again&s;t the coali|tion &s;erved as friend&s;hip to him, and his ignorance of vice was credited for virtue. With the return of peace, commerce and pro&s;perity would ri&s;e of it&s;elf; yet even this encrea&s;e was thrown to his account.</P>
<P>When he came to the helm the &s;torm was over, and he had nothing to interrupt his cour&s;e. It re|quired
<PB N="157" REF="170"> even ingenuity to be wrong, and he &s;uc|ceeded. A little time &s;hewed him the &s;ame &s;ort of man as his predece&s;&s;ors had been. In&s;tead of profiting by tho&s;e errors which had accumulated a burthen of taxes unparalleled in the world, he &s;ought, I might almo&s;t &s;ay, he adverti&s;ed for ene|mies, and provoked means to encrea&s;e taxation. Aiming at &s;omething, he knew not What, he ran|&s;acked Europe and India for adventures, and aban|doning the fair preten&s;ions he began with, became the knight-errant of modern times.</P>
<P>It is unplea&s;ant to &s;ee character throw it&s;elf away. It is more &s;o to &s;ee one's-&s;elf deceived. Mr. Pitt had merited nothing, but he promi&s;ed much. He gave &s;ymptoms of a mind &s;uperior to the meanne&s;s and corruption of courts. His ap|parent candour encouraged expectations; and the public confidence, &s;tunned, wearied, and confounded by a chaos of parties, revived and attached it&s;elf to him. But mi&s;taking, as he has done, the di&s;gu&s;t of the nation again&s;t the coalition, for merit in him&s;elf, he has ru&s;hed into mea&s;ures, which a man le&s;s &s;upported would not have pre|&s;umed to act.</P>
<P>All this &s;eems to &s;hew that change of mini&s;ters amounts to nothing. One goes out, another comes in, and &s;till the &s;ame mea&s;ures, vices, and extra|vagance are pur&s;ued. It &s;ignifies not who is mi|ni&s;ter. The defect lies in the &s;y&s;tem. The foun|dation and the &s;uper&s;tructure of the government
<PB N="158" REF="171"> is bad. Prop it as you plea&s;e, it continually &s;inks into court government, and ever will.</P>
<P>I return, as I promi&s;ed, to the &s;ubject of the national debt, that offspring of the Dutch-Anglo revolution, and its handmaid the Hanover &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it is now too late to enquire how it began. Tho&s;e to whom it is due have advanced the mo|ney; and whether it was well or ill &s;pent, or pocketed, is not their crime. It is, however, ea&s;y to &s;ee, that as the nation proceeds in contemplat|ing the nature and principles of government, and to under&s;tand taxes, and make compari&s;ons be|tween tho&s;e of America, France, and England, it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible to keep it in the &s;ame torpid &s;tate it has hitherto been. Some re|form mu&s;t, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, &s;oon begin. It is not whether the&s;e principles pre&s;s with little or much force in the pre&s;ent moment. They are out. They are abroad in the world, and no force can &s;top them. Like a &s;ecret told, they are beyond recall; and he mu&s;t be blind indeed that does not &s;ee that a change is already beginning.</P>
<P>Nine millions of dead taxes is a &s;erious thing; and this not only for bad, but in a great mea&s;ure for foreign government. By putting the power of making war into the hands of foreigners who came for what they could get, little el&s;e was to be ex|pected than what has happened.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="172">Rea&s;ons are already advanced in this work &s;hew|ing that whatever the reforms in the taxes may be, they ought to be made in the current expences of government, and not in the part applied to the intere&s;t of the national debt. By remitting the taxes of the poor, <HI>they</HI> will be totally relieved, and all di&s;content on their part will be taken away; and by &s;triking off &s;uch of the taxes as are already men|tioned, the nation will more than recover the whole expence of the mad American war.</P>
<P>There will then remain only the national debt as a &s;ubject of di&s;content; and in order to remove, or rather to prevent this, it would be good policy in the &s;tock-holders them&s;elves to con&s;ider it as property, &s;ubject like all other property, to bear &s;ome portion of the taxes. It would give to it both popularity and &s;ecurity, and as a great part of its pre&s;ent inconvenience is balanced by the ca|pital which it keeps alive, a mea&s;ure of this kind would &s;o far add to that balance as to &s;ilence ob|jections.</P>
<P>This may be done by &s;uch gradual means as to accompli&s;h all that is nece&s;&s;ary with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and convenience.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of taxing the capital, the be&s;t method would be to tax the intere&s;t by &s;ome progre&s;&s;ive ratio, and to le&s;&s;en the public taxes in the &s;ame proportion as the intere&s;t dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the intere&s;t was taxed one halfpenny in the pound the fir&s;t year, a penny more the &s;econd,
<PB N="160" REF="173"> and to proceed by a certain ratio to be determined upon, always le&s;s than any other tax upon property. Such a tax would be &s;ubtracted from the intere&s;t at the time of payment, without any expence of col|lection.</P>
<P>One halfpenny in the pound would le&s;&s;en the intere&s;t and con&s;equently the taxes, twenty thou|&s;and pounds. The tax on waggons amounts to this &s;um, and this tax might be taken off the fir&s;t year. The &s;econd year the tax on female &s;ervants, or &s;ome other of the like amount might al&s;o be taken off, and by proceeding in this manner, always ap|plying the tax rai&s;ed from the property of the debt towards its extinction, and not carry it to the cur|rent &s;ervices, it would liberate it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;tockholders, notwith&s;tanding this tax, would pay le&s;s taxes than they do now. What they would &s;ave by the extinction of the poor-rates, and the tax on hou&s;es and windows, and the commutation tax, would be con&s;iderably greater than what this tax, &s;low, but certain in its operation, amounts to.</P>
<P>It appears to me to be prudence to look out for mea&s;ures that may apply under any circum&s;tance that may approach. There is, at this moment, a cri&s;is in the affairs of Europe that requires it. Preparation now is wi&s;dom. If taxation be once let loo&s;e, it will be difficult to re-in&s;tate it; neither would the relief be &s;o effectual, as to proceed by &s;ome certain and gradual reduction.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174">The fraud, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ition of govern|ments, are now beginning to be too well under|&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, in all countries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;|&s;ing for the funeral. Let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</P>
<P>The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick for men, at the expence of a million a year, who under&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capaci|ties would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of a pari&s;h con&s;table. If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</P>
<P>When it &s;hall be &s;aid in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor di&s;tre&s;s is to be found among them; my jails are empty of pri&s;oners, my &s;treets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppre&s;&s;ive; the rational world is my friend, becau&s;e I am the friend of its happine&s;s: when the&s;e things can be &s;aid, then may that country boa&s;t its con&s;titution and its government.</P>
<P>Within the &s;pace of a few years we have &s;een two Revolutions, tho&s;e of America and France. In the former, the conte&s;t was long, and the conflict &s;e|vere;
<PB N="162" REF="175"> in the latter, the nation acted with &s;uch a con&s;olidated impul&s;e, that having no foreign ene|my to contend with, the revolution was complete in power the moment it appeared. From both tho&s;e in&s;tances it is evident, that the greate&s;t forces that can be brought into the field of revolutions, are rea&s;on and common intere&s;t. Where the&s;e can have the opportunity of acting, oppo&s;ition dies with fear, or crumbles away by conviction. It is a great &s;tanding which they have now uni|ver&s;ally obtained; and we may hereafter hope to &s;ee revolutions, or changes in governments, pro|duced with the &s;ame quiet operation by which any mea&s;ure, determinable by rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, is accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accompli&s;hed by rea&s;on. Rebellion con&s;i&s;ts in forcibly op|po&s;ing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, there|fore, to be in every nation a method of occa&s;ionally a&s;certaining the &s;tate of public opinion with re&s;pect to government. On this point the old govern|ment of France was &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent go|vernment of England, becau&s;e, on extraordinary occa&s;ions, recour&s;e could be had to what was then called the States General. But in England there are no &s;uch occa&s;ional bodies; and as to tho&s;e who are now called Repre&s;entatives, a great part of
<PB N="163" REF="176"> them are mere machines of the court, placemen, and dependants.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, that though all the people of Eng|land pay taxes, not an hundredth part of them are electors, and the members of one of the hou&s;es of parliament repre&s;ent nobody but them&s;elves. There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter re&s;pecting a general reform; and by the &s;ame right that two per&s;ons can confer on &s;uch a &s;ubject, a thou&s;and may. The object, in all &s;uch preliminary proceedings, is to find out what the general &s;en&s;e of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or chu&s;e to pay ten times more taxes than there is occa&s;ion for, it has a right &s;o to do; and &s;o long as the majority do not impo&s;e condi|tions on the minority, different to what they im|po&s;e on them&s;elves, though there may be much error, there is no inju&s;tice. Neither will the error continue long. Rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will &s;oon bring things right, however wrong they may be|gin. By &s;uch a proce&s;s no tumult is to be appre|hended. The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their intere&s;t and happine&s;s is included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous.</P>
<P>The objects that now pre&s;s on the public atten|tion are, the French revolution, and the pro&s;pect of a general revolution in governments. Of all
<PB N="162" REF="177">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="163" REF="178">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="164" REF="179"> nations in Europe, there is none &s;o much intere&s;ted in the French revolution as England. Enemies for ages, and that at a va&s;t expence, and without any national object, the opportunity now pre&s;ents it&s;elf of amicably clo&s;ing the &s;cene, and joining their efforts to reform the re&s;t of Europe. By do|ing this, they will not only prevent the further ef|fu&s;ion of blood, and encrea&s;e of taxes, but be in a con|dition of getting rid of a con&s;iderable part of their pre&s;ent burthens, as has been already &s;tated. Long experience however has &s;hewn, that reforms of this kind are not tho&s;e which old governments wi&s;h to promote; and therefore it is to nations, and not to &s;uch governments, that the&s;e matters pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the preceding part of this work, I have &s;poken of an alliance between England, France, and Ame|rica, for purpo&s;es that were to be afterwards men|tioned. Though I have no direct authority on the part of America, I have good rea&s;on to con|clude, that &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to enter into a con&s;i|deration of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, provided, that the go|vernments with which &s;he might ally, acted as na|tional governments, and not as courts enveloped in intrigue and my&s;tery. That France as a na|tion, and a national government, would prefer an alliance with England, is a matter of certainty. Nations, like individuals, who have long been enemies, without knowing each other, or knowing why, become the better friends when they di&s;cover
<PB N="165" REF="180"> the errors and impo&s;itions under which they had acted.</P>
<P>Admitting, therefore, the probability of &s;uch a connection, I will &s;tate &s;ome matters by which &s;uch an alliance, together with that of Holland, might render &s;ervice, not only to the parties immediately concerned, but to all Europe.</P>
<P>It is, I think, certain, that if the fleets of Eng|land, France, and Holland were confederated, they could propo&s;e, with effect, a limitation to, and a general di&s;mantling of all the navies in Europe, to a certain proportion to be agreed upon.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That no new &s;hip of war &s;hall be built by any power in Europe, them&s;elves included.</P>
<P>Secondly, That all the navies now in exi&s;tence &s;hall be put back, &s;uppo&s;e to one tenth of their pre&s;ent force. This will &s;ave to France and Eng|land at lea&s;t two millions &s;terling annually to each, and their relative force be in the &s;ame proportion as it is now. If men will permit them&s;elves to think, as rational beings ought to think, nothing can appear more ridiculous and ab&s;urd, exclu&s;ive of all moral reflections, than to be at the expence of building navies, filling them with men, and then hauling them into the ocean, to try which can &s;ink each other fa&s;te&s;t. Peace, which co&s;ts nothing, is attended with infinitely more advan|tage, than any victory with all its expence. But this, though it be&s;t an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of nations, does not that of court governments, who&s;e habited policy is pretence for taxation, places, and offices.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="181">It is, I think, al&s;o certain, that the above con|federated powers, together with that of the United States of America, can propo&s;e with effect, to Spain, the independance of South America, and the opening tho&s;e countries of immen&s;e extent and wealth to the general commerce of the world, as North America now is.</P>
<P>With how much more glory, and advantage to it&s;elf, does a nation act, when it exerts its powers to re&s;cue the world from bondage, and to create it&s;elf friends, than when it employs tho&s;e powers to encrea&s;e ruin, de&s;olation, and mi&s;ery. The horrid &s;cene that is now acting by the Engli&s;h go|vernment in the Ea&s;t-Indies, is fit only to be told of Goths and Vandals, who, de&s;titute of princi|ciple, robbed and tortured the world they were incapable of enjoying.</P>
<P>The opening of South America would produce an immen&s;e field of commerce, and a ready money market for manufactures, which the ea&s;tern world does not. The Ea&s;t is already a country full of ma|nufactures, the importation of which is not only an injury to the manufactures of England, but a drain upon its &s;pecie. The balance again&s;t England by this trade is regularly upwards of half a million annually &s;ent out in the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips in &s;ilver; and this is the rea&s;on, together with German in|trigue, and German &s;ub&s;idies, there is &s;o little &s;ilver in England.</P>
<P>But any war is harve&s;t to &s;uch governments, how|ever ruinous it may be to a nation. It &s;erves to
<PB N="167" REF="182"> keep up deceitful expectations which prevent a people looking into the defects and abu&s;es of go|vernment. It is the <HI>lo here!</HI> and the <HI>lo there!</HI> that amu&s;es and cheats the multitude.</P>
<P>Never did &s;o great an opportunity offer it&s;elf to England, and to all Europe, as is produced by the two Revolutions of America and France. By the former, freedom has a national champion in the We&s;tern world; and by the latter, in Europe. When another nation &s;hall join France, de&s;poti&s;m and bad government will &s;carcely dare to appear. To u&s;e a trite expre&s;&s;ion, the iron is becoming hot all over Europe. The in&s;ulted German and the en&s;laved Spaniard, the Ru&s;s and the Pole, are be|ginning to think. The pre&s;ent age will hereafter merit to be called the Age of rea&s;on, and the pre|&s;ent generation will appear to the future as the Adam of a new world.</P>
<P>When all the governments of Europe &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, nations will become acquainted, and the animo&s;ities and prejudices fomented by the intrigue and artifice of courts, will cea&s;e. The oppre&s;&s;ed &s;oldier will become a freeman; and the tortured &s;ailor, no longer dragged along the &s;treets like a felon, will pur&s;ue his mercantile voyage in &s;afety. It would be better that nations &s;hould continue the pay of their &s;oldiers during their lives, and give them their di&s;charge and re&s;tore them to freedom and their friends, and cea&s;e recruiting, than retain &s;uch mul|titudes at the &s;ame expence, in a condition u&s;ele&s;s
<PB N="168" REF="183"> to &s;ociety and them&s;elves. As &s;oldiers have hither|to been treated in mo&s;t countries, they might be &s;aid to be without a friend. Shunned by the citi|zen on an apprehen&s;ion of being enemies to liber|ty, and too often in&s;ulted by tho&s;e who com|manded them, their condition was a double op|pre&s;&s;ion. But where genuine principles of liberty pervade a people, every thing is re&s;tored to order; and the &s;oldier civily treated, returns the civi|lity.</P>
<P>In contemplating revolutions, it is ea&s;y to per|ceive that they may ari&s;e from two di&s;tinct cau&s;es; the one, to avoid or get rid of &s;ome great calamity; the other, to obtain &s;ome great and po&s;itive good; and the two may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of active and pa&s;&s;ive revolutions. In tho&s;e which proceed from the former cau&s;e, the temper be|comes incen&s;ed and &s;owered; and the redre&s;s, ob|tained by danger, is too often &s;ullied by revenge. But in tho&s;e which proceed from the latter, the heart, rather animated than agitated, enters &s;e|renely upon the &s;ubject. Rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, per&s;ua&s;ion and conviction, become the weapons in the conte&s;t, and it is only when tho&s;e are attempted to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that recource is had to violence. When men unite in agreeing that a <HI>thing is good,</HI> could it be obtained, &s;uch as relief from a burden of taxes and the extinction of corruption, the ob|ject is more than half accompli&s;hed. What they approve as the end, they will promote in the means.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184">Will any man &s;ay, in the pre&s;ent exce&s;s of tax|ation, falling &s;o heavily on the poor, that a remi&s;|&s;ion of five pounds annually of taxes to one hun|dred and four thou&s;and poor families is not a <HI>good thing?</HI> Will he &s;ay, that a remi&s;&s;ion of &s;even pounds annually to one hundred thou&s;and other poor families&mdash;of eight pounds annually to another hundred thou&s;and poor families, and of ten pounds annually to fifty thou&s;and poor and widowed fami|lies, are not <HI>good things?</HI> And to proceed a &s;tep farther in this climax, will he &s;ay, that to provide again&s;t the misfortunes to which all human life is &s;ubject, by &s;ecuring &s;ix pounds annually for all poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and reduced per&s;ons of the age of fifty and until &s;ixty, and of ten pounds annually after &s;ixty is not a <HI>good thing?</HI></P>
<P>Will he &s;ay, that an abolition of two million of poor-rates to the hou&s;e-keepers, and of the whole of the hou&s;e and window-light tax and of the com|mutation tax is not a <HI>good thing?</HI> Or will he &s;ay, that to aboli&s;h corruption is a <HI>bad thing?</HI></P>
<P>If, therefore, the good to be obtained be worthy of a pa&s;&s;ive, rational, and co&s;tle&s;s revolution, it would be bad policy to prefer waiting for a cala|mity that &s;hould force a violent one. I have no idea, con&s;idering the reforms which are now pa&s;&s;ing and &s;preading throughout Europe, that England will permit her&s;elf to be the la&s;t; and where the occa&s;ion and the opportunity quietly offer, it is better than to wait for a turbulent nece&s;&s;ity. It may be con&s;idered as an honour to the animal facul|ties
<PB N="170" REF="185"> of man to obtain redre&s;s by courage and dan|ger, but it is far greater honour to the rational fa|culties to accompli&s;h the &s;ame object by rea&s;on, accommodation, and general con&s;ent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know it is the opinion of many of the mo&s;t enlightened characters in France (there always will be tho&s;e who &s;ee farther into events than others) not only among the general ma&s;s of citi|zens, but of many of the principal members of the former Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, that the monarchical plan will not continue many years in that country. They have found out, that as wi&s;|dom cannot be made hereditary, power ought not; and that, for a man to merit a million &s;tirling a year from a nation, he ought to have a mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a univer&s;e; which, if he had, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wi&s;hed not to appear to lead the nation fa&s;ter than its own rea&s;on and intere&s;t dictated. In all the conver&s;ations where I have been pre&s;ent upon this &s;ubject, the idea always was, that when &s;uch a time, from the general opinion of the nation, &s;hall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be, to make a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent in &s;ee &s;imple to the per&s;on whoever he may be, that &s;hall then be in the monarchical office, and for him to retire to the enjoyment of private life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his &s;hare of ge|neral rights and privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time and his conduct than any other citizen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As reforms, or revolutions, call them which you plea&s;e, extend them&s;elves among nations, tho&s;e nations will form connections and conventions, and when a few are thus confederated, the pro|gre&s;s will be rapid, till de&s;poti&s;m and corrupt go|vernment be totally expelled, at lea&s;t out of two quarters of the world, Europe and America. The Algerine piracy may then be commanded to cea&s;e, for it is only by the malicious policy of old go|vernments, again&s;t each other, that it exi&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="186">Throughout this work, various and numerous as the &s;ubjects are, which I have taken up and in|ve&s;tigated, there is only a &s;ingle paragraph upon religion, viz. <Q>that every religion is good, that teaches man to be good.</Q></P>
<P>I have carefully avoided to enlarge upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e I am inclined to believe, that what is called the pre&s;ent mini&s;try wi&s;h to &s;ee contentions about religion kept up, to prevent the nation turning its attention to &s;ubjects of govern|ment. It is, as if they were to &s;ay, <Q>Look that way, or any way, but this.</Q></P>
<P>But as religion is very improperly made a poli|tical machine, and the reality of it is thereby de|&s;troyed, I will conclude this work with &s;tating in what light religion appears to me.</P>
<P>If we &s;uppo&s;e a large family of children, who, on any particular day, or particular circum&s;tance, made it a cu&s;tom to pre&s;ent to their parent &s;ome token of their affection and gratitude, each of them would make a different offering, and mo&s;t proba|bly in a different manner. Some would pay their congratulations in themes of ver&s;e or pro&s;e, by &s;ome little devices, as their genius dic|tated, or according to what they thought would plea&s;e; and, perhaps, the lea&s;t of all, not able to do any of tho&s;e things, would ramble into the garden, or the field, and gather what it thought the prettie&s;t flower it could find, though, perhaps, it might be but a &s;imple weed. The parent would be more gratified by &s;uch variety, than if the whole of
<PB N="172" REF="187"> them had acted on a concerted plan, and each had made exactly the &s;ame offering. This would have the cold appearance of contrivance, or the har&s;h one of controul. But of all unwelcome things, nothing could more afflict the parent than to know, that the whole of them had afterwards gotten together by the ears, boys and girls, fight|ing, &s;cratching, reviling, and abu&s;ing each other about which was the be&s;t or the wor&s;t pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Why may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that the great Fa|ther of all is plea&s;ed with variety of devotion; and that the greate&s;t offence we can act, is that by which we &s;eek to torment and render each other mi&s;erable. For my own part, I am fully &s;atisfied that what I am now doing, with an endeavour to conciliate mankind, to render their condition hap|py, to unite nations that have hitherto been ene|mies, and to extirpate the horrid practice of war, and break the chains of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, is acceptable in his &s;ight, and being the be&s;t &s;ervice I can perform, I act it chearfully.</P>
<P>I do not believe that any two men, on what are called doctrinal points, think alike who think at all. It is only tho&s;e who have not thought that appear to agree. It is in this ca&s;e as with what is called the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. It has been taken for granted to be good, and encomiums have &s;up|plied the place of proof. But when the nation come to examine into its principles and the abu&s;es it admits, it will be found to have more defects than I have pointed out in this work and the former.</P>
<P>As to what are called national religions, we
<PB N="173" REF="188"> may, with as much propriety, talk of national Gods. It is either political craft or the remains of the Pagan &s;y&s;tem, when every nation had its &s;epa|rate and particular deity. Among all the writers of the Engli&s;h church clergy, who have treated on the general &s;ubject of religion, the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Landaff has not been excelled, and it is with much plea&s;ure that I take the opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing this token of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the whole of the &s;ub|ject, at lea&s;t, as far as it appears to me at pre&s;ent. It has been my intention for the five years I have been in Europe, to offer an addre&s;s to the people of England on the &s;ubject of government, if the op|portunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf before I returned to Ame|rica. Mr. Burke has thrown it in my way, and I thank him. On a certain occa&s;ion three years ago, I pre&s;&s;ed him to propo&s;e a national convention to be fairly elected for the purpo&s;e of taking the &s;tate of the nation into con&s;ideration; but I found, that however &s;trongly the parliamentary current was then &s;etting again&s;t the party he acted with, their policy was to keep every thing within that field of corruption, and tru&s;t to accidents. Long ex|perience had &s;hewn that parliaments would follow any change of mini&s;ters, and on this they re&s;ted their hopes and their expectations.</P>
<P>Formerly, when divi&s;ions aro&s;e re&s;pecting go|vernments, recour&s;e was had to the &s;word, and a civil war en&s;ued. That &s;avage cu&s;tom is exploded by the new &s;y&s;tem, and reference is had to national conventions. Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and the general will ar|bitrates
<PB N="174" REF="189"> the que&s;tion, and to this, private opinion yields with a good grace, and order is pre&s;erved uninterrupted.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen have affected to call the prin|ciples upon which this work and the former part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> are founded, "a new fangled doc|trine." The que&s;tion is not whether tho&s;e princi|ples are new or old, but whether they are right or wrong. Suppo&s;e the former, I will &s;hew their ef|fect by a figure ea&s;ily under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It is now towards the middle of February. Were I to take a turn into the country, the trees would pre&s;ent a leafle&s;s winterly appearance. As people are apt to pluck twigs as they walk along, I per|haps might do the &s;ame, and by chance might ob|&s;erve, that a <HI>&s;ingle bud</HI> on that twig had begun to &s;well. I &s;hould rea&s;on very unnaturally, or rather not rea&s;on at all, to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>this</HI> was the <HI>only</HI> bud in England which had this appearance. In&s;tead of deciding thus, I &s;hould in&s;tantly conclude, that the &s;ame appearance was beginning, or about to begin, every where; and though the vegetable &s;leep will continue longer on &s;ome trees and plants than on others, and though &s;ome of them may not <HI>blo&s;&s;om</HI> for two or three years, all will be in leaf in the &s;ummer, except tho&s;e which are <HI>rotten.</HI> What pace the political &s;ummer may keep with the na|tural, no human fore&s;ight can determine. It is, however, not difficult to perceive that the &s;pring is begun.&mdash;Thus wi&s;hing, as I &s;incerely do, freedom and happine&s;s to all nations, I clo&s;e the</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AS the publication of this work has been delayed be|yond the time intended, I think it not improper, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, to &s;tate the cau&s;es that have oc|ca&s;ioned the delay.</P>
<P>The reader will probably ob&s;erve, that &s;ome parts in the plan contained in this work for reducing the taxes, and certain parts in Mr. Pitt's &s;peech at the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, Tue&s;day, January 31, are &s;o much alike, as to induce a belief, that either the Author had taken the hint from Mr. Pitt, or Mr. Pitt from the Author.&mdash;I will fir&s;t point out the parts that are &s;imilar, and then &s;tate &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as I am acquainted with, leaving the reader to make his own conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering it almo&s;t an unprecedented ca&s;e, that taxes &s;hould be propo&s;ed to be taken off, it is equally as extraor|dinary that &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould occur to two per&s;ons at the &s;ame time; and &s;till more &s;o, (con&s;idering the va&s;t va|riety and multiplicity of taxes) that they &s;hould hit on the &s;ame &s;pecific taxes. Mr. Pitt has mentioned, in his &s;peech, the tax on <HI>Carts</HI> and <HI>Waggons</HI>&mdash;that on <HI>Female Servants</HI>&mdash; the lowering the tax on <HI>Candles,</HI> and the taking off the tax of three &s;hillings on <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> having under &s;even windows.</P>
<P>Every one of tho&s;e &s;pecific taxes are a part of the plan contained in this work, and propo&s;ed al&s;o to be taken off. Mr. Pitt's plan, it is true, goes no farther than to a reduc|tion of three hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds; and the reduction propo&s;ed in this work to nearly &s;ix millions. I have made my calculations on only &s;ixteen millions and an half of revenue, &s;till a&s;&s;erting that it was <Q>very nearly, if not quite, &s;eventeen millions.</Q> Mr. Pitt &s;tates it at 16,690,000. I know enough of the matter to &s;ay, that he has not <HI>over</HI>&s;tated it. Having thus given the par|ticulars, which corre&s;pond in this work and his &s;peech, I will &s;tate a chain of circum&s;tances that may lead to &s;ome explanation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hint for le&s;&s;ening the taxes, and that as a con|&s;equence flowing from the French revolution, is to be found in the ADDRESS and DECLARATION of the Gen|tlemen who met at the Thatched-Hou&s;e Tavern, Augu&s;t 20, 1791. Among many other particulars &s;tated in that Addre&s;s, is the following, put as an interrogation to the
<PB N="176" REF="191"> government oppo&s;ers of the French Revolution. <Q>Art they &s;orry that the pretence for new oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, and the occa&s;ion for continuing many old taxes will be at an end?</Q></P>
<P>It is well known, that the per&s;ons who chiefly frequent the Thatched Hou&s;e Tavern, are men of court connections, and &s;o much did they take this Addre&s;s and Declaration re|&s;pecting the French revolution and the reduction of taxes in di&s;gu&s;t, that the Landlord was under the nece&s;&s;ity of in|forming the Gentlemen, who compo&s;ed the meeting of the twentieth of Augu&s;t, and who propo&s;ed holding another meeting, that he could not receive them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gentleman who &s;igned the addre&s;s and declaration as chairman of the meeting, M. Horne Tooke, being generally &s;up|po&s;ed to be the per&s;on who drew it up, and having &s;poken much in commendation of it, has been jocularly accu&s;ed of prai&s;ing his own work. To free him from this embara&s;&s;ment, and to &s;ave him the repeated trouble of mentioning the author, as he has not failed to do, I make no he&s;itation in &s;aying, that as the oppor|tunity of benefiting by the French Revolution ea&s;ily occurred to me, I drew up the publication in que&s;tion, and &s;hewed it to him and &s;ome other gentlemen; who, fully approving it, held a meet|ing for the purpo&s;e of making it public, and &s;ub&s;cribed to the amount of fifty guineas to defray the expence of adverti&s;ing. I believe there are at this time, in England, a greater number of men acting on di&s;intere&s;ted principles, and determined to look into the nature and practices of government them&s;elves, and not blindly tru&s;t, as has hitherto been the ca&s;e, either to government generally, or to parliaments, or to parliamentary oppo&s;ition, than at any former period. Had this been done a century ago, corruption and taxation had not arrived to the height they are now at.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What was only hinted at in the Addre&s;s and Declara|tion, re&s;pecting taxes and principles of government, will be found reduced to a regular &s;y&s;tem in this work. But as Mr. Pitt's &s;peech contains &s;ome of the &s;ame things re&s;pect|ing taxes, I now come to give the circum&s;tances before al|luded to.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is: This work was intended to be publi&s;hed ju&s;t before the meeting of Parliament, and for that purpo&s;e a con&s;iderable part of the copy was put into the printer's hands in September, and all the remaining copy, as far as page 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which contains the parts to which Mr. Pitt's &s;peech is &s;imilar, was given to him full &s;ix weeks before the meeting of parliament, and he was informed of the time at which it was to appear. He had compo&s;ed nearly the
<PB N="177" REF="192"> whole about a fortnight before the time of Parliament meeting, and had printed as far as page 112, and had given me a proof of the next &s;heet, up to page 128. It was then in &s;ufficient forwardne&s;s to be out at the time propo&s;ed, as two other &s;heets were ready for &s;triking off. I had before told him, that if he thought he &s;hould be &s;traightened for time, I would get part of the work done at another pre&s;s, which he de&s;ired me not to do. In this manner the work &s;tood on the Tue&s;day fortnight preceding the meet|ing of Parliament, when all at once, without any previous intimation, though I had been with him the evening before, he &s;ent me, by one of his workmen, all the remaining copy, from page 112, declining to go on with the work <HI>on any con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>To account for this extraordinary conduct I was totally at a lo&s;s, as he &s;topped at the part where the arguments on &s;y&s;tems and principles of government clo&s;ed, and where the plan for the reduction of taxes, the education of children, and the &s;upport of the poor and the aged begins; and &s;till more e&s;pecially, as he had, at the time of his beginning to print, and before he had &s;een the whole copy, offered a thou|&s;and pounds for the copy-right, together with the future copy-right of the former part of the Rights of Man. I told the per&s;on who brought me this offer that I &s;hould not accept it, and wi&s;hed it not to be renewed, giving him as my rea&s;on, that though I believed the printer to be an hone&s;t man, I would never put it in the power of any printer or publi&s;her to &s;uppre&s;s or alter a work of mine, by making him ma&s;ter of the copy, or give to him the right of &s;elling it to any mini&s;ter, or to any other per&s;on, or to treat as a mere matter of traffic, that which I intended &s;hould operate as a principle.</P>
<P>His refu&s;al to complete the work (which he could not purcha&s;e) obliged me to &s;eek for another printer, and this of con&s;equence would throw the publication back till after the meeting of Parliament, otherways it would have ap|peared that Mr. Pitt had only taken up a part of the plan which I had more fully &s;tated.</P>
<P>Whether that gentleman, or any other, had &s;een the work, or any part of it, is more than I have authority to &s;ay. But the manner in which the work was returned, and the particular time at which this was done, and that after the offers he had made, are &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances. I know what the opinion of book&s;ellers and publi&s;hers is upon &s;uch a ca&s;e, but as to my own opinion, I chu&s;e to make no declara|tion.
<PB N="178" REF="193"> There are many ways by which proof &s;heets may be procured by other per&s;ons before a work publicly appear; to which I &s;hall add a certain circum&s;tance, which is,</P>
<P>A mini&s;terial book&s;eller in Piccadilly who has been em+ployed, as common report &s;ays, by a clerk of one of the boards clo&s;ely connected with the mini&s;try (the board of trade and plantation of which Hawk&s;bury is pre&s;ident) to publi&s;h what he calls my Life (I wi&s;h his own life and that th&s;oe of the cabinet were as good) u&s;ed to have his books printed at the &s;ame printing-office that I employed; but when the former part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> came out, he took his work away in dudgeon; and about a week or ten days before the printer returned my copy, he came to make him an offer of his work again, which was accepted. This would con&s;equently give him admi&s;&s;ion into the printing-office where the &s;heets of this work were then lying; and as book&s;ellers and printers are free with each other, he would have the opportunity of &s;eeing what was going on. &mdash;Be the ca&s;e however as it may, Mr. Pitt's plan, little and diminutive as it is, would have had a very awkward ap|pearance, had this work appeared at the time the printer had engaged to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>I have now &s;tated the particulars which occa&s;ioned the delay, from the propo&s;al to purcha&s;e, to the refu&s;al to print. If all the Gentlemen are innocent, it is very unfortunate for them that &s;uch a variety of &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances &s;hould without any de&s;ign, arrange them&s;elves together.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed this part, I will conclude with &s;tat|ing another circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>About a fortnight or three weeks before the meeting of Parliament, a &s;mall addition, amounting to about twelve &s;hillings and &s;ix pence a year, was made to the pay of the &s;oldiers, or rather, their pay was docked &s;o much le&s;s. Some Gentlemen who knew, in part, that this work would contain a plan of reforms re&s;pecting the oppre&s;&s;ed condition of &s;oldiers, wi&s;hed me to add a note to the work, &s;ignify|ing, that the part upon that &s;ubject had been in the printer's hands &s;ome weeks before that addition of pay was propo&s;ed. I declined doing this, le&s;t it &s;hould be interpreted into an air of vanity, or an endeavour to excite &s;u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icion (for which, perhaps, there might be no grounds) that &s;ome of the government gentlemen, had, by &s;ome means or other, made out what this work would contain: and had not the printing been interrupted &s;o as to occa&s;ion a delay beyond the time fixed for publication, nothing contained in this appendix would have appeared.</P>
