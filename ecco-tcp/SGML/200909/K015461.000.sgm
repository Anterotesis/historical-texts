<HEAD>DEFINITION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><Q>A Con&s;titution is a <HI>Thing</HI> antecedent to Government, and a Government is only the Creature of a Con&s;titution. The Con&s;titution of a Country is not the act of its Government, but of <HI>the People</HI> con&s;tituting a Government. It is the Body of Elements to which you can refer and quote article by article; and which contains the principles upon which the Government &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the manner in which it &s;hall be organized, the powers it &s;hall have, the Mode of Elections, the Duration of Parliaments, or by what other name &s;uch Bodies may be called; the powers which the ex|ecutive
<PB N="4" REF="3">part of the Government &s;hall have; and, in fine, <HI>every thing</HI> that relates to the <HI>compleat organization</HI> of a <HI>civil government,</HI> and the principles upon which it &s;hall act, and by which it &s;hall be bound. A Con&s;titution, therefore, is to a Government what the laws made afterwards by that Government are to a Court of Judicature. The Court of Ju|dicature does not make the laws, neither can it alter them; it only acts in con|formity to the laws made: and the Govern|ment is in like manner governed by the Con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Rights of Man, by Thomas Paine, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a fortunate Age is this, Mr. Paine, when every thing is defined, every thing laid open to the meane&s;t capacities, every prejudice done away, and Truth &s;tands blu&s;hing before us &s;tripped &s;tark naked! I had always had a &s;trange veneration for the word <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> though, to &s;ay the truth, till
<PB N="5" REF="4">I had the good fortune to &s;tumble upon the above <HI>&s;hort, clear,</HI> and <HI>preci&s;e</HI> definition of it, I was as little able to have explained its exact meaning, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e who make u&s;e of it every day, without a&s;king them&s;elves whether they annex to it any determinate &s;ignification.</P>
<P>You have told us, Sir, what a Con&s;ti|tution <HI>is</HI> and what it is <HI>not.</HI> I am now in&s;tructed, that it is <HI>a thing</HI> both in fact and name:
<Q>"Aye, but what thing, Sir John, what thing?"</Q> Why it is a thing that begets Government, which begets Laws, which beget Judica|ture, &amp;c. and &s;o they go on begetting one another to the end of the chapter. And who begot the Con&s;titution? Why <HI>the People;</HI> that is, every individual of the Commu|nity, who having, at &s;ome time or other, been a&s;&s;embled together, before the exi&s;tence of Law and Government, in a perfect &s;tate of independent nature, did by them&s;elves, or by a &s;elect number among&s;t them cho&s;en
<PB N="6" REF="5">for that purpo&s;e, agree upon a <HI>Body of Elements</HI> to which you can refer and quote <HI>article</HI> by <HI>article in a vi&s;ible form:</HI> Parlia|ments, Elections, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;That all this is binding upon the Community for ever, not to be altered in an <HI>iota,</HI> till, by what is called <HI>a Revolution,</HI> the people think fit to put them&s;elves (as they have always a right to do), back again into the original &s;tate, by extingui&s;hing all Law and Govern|ment, in order to amu&s;e them&s;elves with making a new Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>By this definition, it is indeed clear, that neither France nor England ever had a Con|&s;titution, nor any other country that I ever heard of. Thus, after mankind has been more or le&s;s in a &s;tate of Civil Government all over the world, for &s;o many thou&s;and years, it was re&s;erved for the Philo&s;ophers of North America and the Jacobins <Q>enlightened and enlightening,</Q> to convey to us the de|finition, through your organs, of a word, to which, though it had been &s;o long in every body's mouth, the true &s;en&s;e had never
<PB N="7" REF="6">been affixed&mdash;a word expre&s;&s;ive of a <HI>Thing</HI> that never has had an exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>With due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, Sir, to your in|&s;tructive judgment, &s;uffer me to doubt at lea&s;t, whether the term, in your &s;en&s;e of it, can be, with more propriety, applied to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of France &s;ince the Revolution, than it would under the Monarchy they have done away. I will admit, if you plea&s;e (what I believe you would hardly think of a&s;&s;uming as the fact), that the elections of the Members to the A&s;&s;emble&eacute;s des Etats Generaux included the voice of every in|dividual in the community.</P>
<P>But pray, did the People fir&s;t place them|&s;elves in the original primitive &s;tate, by de|claring an abolition of all exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;h|ments? Did they delegate their authority to their Deputies in con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;tate of things, with a formal commi&s;&s;ion expre&s;sly to frame a <HI>new</HI> Con&s;titution as the ba&s;is of a <HI>new</HI> Government?&mdash;Surely I mu&s;t have gro&s;sly deceived my&s;elf, if, in many of their
<PB N="8" REF="7">in&s;tructions, they did not expre&s;sly declare that they were <HI>already</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Con|&s;titution which they reclaimed from the time of Charlemagne; a Con&s;titution that was dear to them in the extreme, and which they recommended to the protection of their at|tornies in the &s;tronge&s;t terms of anxious &s;olicitude. If this was the &s;entiment <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;ed</HI> in &s;ome of the cahiers of in&s;truction, was it not <HI>implied in every one</HI> of them, who unanimou&s;ly declare their attachment to the Monarchy, with the other three orders of the &s;tate, which they declare to be the lawful &s;upreme Legi&s;lature of the kingdom, and which they look up to as the redre&s;s of all their grievances, and the Palladium of their liberties? I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e now that the Repre&s;entatives are wi&s;er than their Con&s;tituents; that the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>elements</HI> they have devi&s;ed, is as much better as you plea&s;e than tho&s;e that were committed to their protection; nay, I will &s;uppo&s;e even that the Nation "enlightened" &s;ince by the force of eloquence and of the lanthorn, are at this moment of the &s;ame opinion with the A&s;|&s;embly;
<PB N="9" REF="8">&s;till, as the Con&s;titution that has been decreed under a commi&s;&s;ion, not only containing no authority from the people for the de&s;truction of all exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hments, and the con&s;tituting new ones, but con|taining the mo&s;t po&s;itive commands to pro|tect the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hments which were held &s;acred by them, it is &s;ubmitted to you, in all humility, whether &s;uch innovations come at all within the limits of your De|finition; whether tho&s;e who accept a tru&s;t to one purpo&s;e, and u&s;e it to the direct con|trary, can avail them&s;elves of the authority they have betrayed; whether, if added to the breach of tru&s;t, there happens to be at the &s;ame time a breach of the <HI>Oath,</HI> their employers exacted from them to abide by their in&s;tructions, in&s;tead of acting in direct oppo&s;ition to them; whether any oath im|po&s;ed upon others afterwards by &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly can be conceived, even by them|&s;elves, to have any validity: whether, in &s;hort, upon your principle, the powers a&s;|&s;umed by &s;uch a Body can be regarded as any thing more than a direct u&s;urpation upon
<PB N="10" REF="9">the rights of the people, and the force they exerci&s;e over all ranks of Citizens, from the Monarch down to the Pea&s;ant, with &s;o free a hand, can be con&s;idered as any thing but the <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> tyranny of an unauthorized though inviolable oppre&s;&s;ion and perjured Senate.</P>
<P>The <HI>conci&s;e, clear,</HI> and <HI>explicit</HI> definition you have given us, Sir, of a Con&s;titution, has one great advantage attached to it, which every <HI>Lover of Liberty</HI> will know how to appre|ciate. As it &s;uppo&s;es an extinction of all law and government previous to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the principles of a future &s;y&s;tem; and, as it is the duty of every good Citizen to endeavour to procure to his country the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation he can devi&s;e, it opens a wide field for <HI>Patriot Exertions.</HI> It is hence|forth not only an innocent occupation, but a meritorious exerci&s;e of the rights of the individual, whenever he has a new Con&s;ti|tution to propo&s;e, to begin by removing out of his way the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hments, that he may convene his Fellow Citizens for the
<PB N="11" REF="10">purpo&s;e of con&s;idering the new body of ele|ments he has to propound. It will there|fore be no longer a crime in future <HI>Le|gi&s;lators,</HI> &s;uch as Guy Vaux, Jack Cade, or Ld. G &mdash; G &mdash;, to de&s;troy the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem; much le&s;s to call upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the people for that purpo&s;e; and &s;till le&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch arguments, through the chan|nel of the pre&s;s, or by word of mouth, as may awaken them to the exerci&s;e of their indi&s;putable indefea&s;ible rights. It is a duty they will fulfil in common with the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities, a Paine, a Cromwell, a Franklyn, a Ravailac, and a Mirabeau. Whoever, in future, &s;hall be arre&s;ted in his career by the charge of &s;edition, will an&s;wer calmly, <Q>I am ignorant of the term; to in|cite my Fellow Citizens to the exerci&s;e of a lawful right, for their own good, can never be imputed as a crime.</Q> If, ani|mated in the cau&s;e of Freedom, he &s;hould be tran&s;ported beyond the bounds of per|&s;ua&s;ion into &s;ome overt act of violence, as parricide, for example, he will &s;ay, <Q>I de|&s;erve a crown of laurel, not a halter. I
<PB N="12" REF="11">have a Con&s;titution to propo&s;e by and by, and am only preparing the nece&s;&s;ary pre|vious &s;teps to it, by bringing about a &s;tate of nature through a Revolution and the extinction of all Law and Govern|ment.&mdash;I &s;tand upon the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I defy you to touch a hair of my head.</Q> What a field does this open for the generous efforts of active patrioti&s;m un|controuled?</P>
<P>Luminous, however, Sir, as your happy definition cannot but be e&s;teemed, the more we reflect upon it; and pregnant with all the benefits to mankind which the philantropy of Modern Philo&s;ophy is &s;o eager to impart; one regret offers it&s;elf upon the peru&s;al of it, viz. the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of applying it to any practical purpo&s;e. Like &s;o many other excellent devices, I fear it is only fitted to the &s;peculation of the clo&s;et and the regions of metaphy&s;ical theory. To obtain the <HI>ac|tual con&s;ent</HI> (for, alas! after all, the <HI>virtual</HI> con&s;ent, through delegates, is little better than a mere fiction of law), by which
<PB N="13" REF="12">millions of individuals equal, free, and inde|pendent, bind them&s;elves to abide by a Go|vernment to be formed upon the Con&s;ti|tution they adopt; to make a multitude and a multitude &s;o compound, capaple of comprehending, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, and determining the nice &s;ubtleties of the <HI>Elements</HI> of civil Polity, without which apprehen&s;ion and deliberation, their con&s;ent is that of an Infant or an Idiot; a mockery and mere form; to frame the&s;e principles of Government and Legi&s;lation upon &s;o broad a ba&s;is, article by article, as to embrace at once all the po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances and &s;ituations, to be bound by them hereafter, any defect in which can have no other remedy but that of an appeal to the people in the &s;tate in which alone they are competent to form a new Con&s;titution: la&s;tly, to give efficacy, &s;y&s;tem, &s;tability, and permanence to a fabric built upon the change|able ba&s;e of the <HI>pupularis aura</HI>&mdash;Such an idea, however &s;ublime, of the only hold by which mankind are to be cemented <HI>rightfully</HI> in &s;ocial relation to each other, is, in truth, a Philo&s;ophy little framed for u&s;eful purpo&s;es,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and worthy only of the elevated con|templations of the Doctors of the Modern School.</P>
<P>Le&s;s acute and le&s;s &s;oaring Geniu&s;es, who&s;e notions of Liberty con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ecure and peaceable enjoyment of legal e&s;tabli&s;hments tran&s;mitted to them by their ance&s;tors, with &s;uch amendments and renovations from time to time as the infallible te&s;t of <HI>experience</HI> may &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of; not in forming <HI>new e&s;tabli&s;hments</HI> upon <HI>new principles;</HI> who pre|fer the being wi&s;ely governed, to the govern|ing others; who can content them&s;elves with the benefits ari&s;ing from good Laws, in&s;tead of indulging them&s;elves in the fanciful <HI>origin of Law</HI> and definition of Con&s;titutions; will carefully keep tho&s;e theoretical &s;pecu|lations at a di&s;tance from the body politic, as they will Books of Phy&s;ic from the body natural, whil&s;t they feel no pre&s;&s;ure of bodily infirmity. No matter, in either ca&s;e, whe|ther the Con&s;titution (i. e. the organization of the con&s;tituent principle of &s;ound health)&punc; be known or defined, they will think it bad
<PB N="15" REF="14">when they &s;uffer, and will &s;eek a remedy; when they do not &s;uffer, they will, if they are wi&s;e, turn their ear from tho&s;e who try to obtrude upon them their no&s;trums and me|dical di&s;qui&s;itions, which in one ca&s;e will make them at lea&s;t hypocondriac and fan|ta&s;tic, and in the other, tends to render them di&s;&s;atisfied, turbulent, and mi&s;chievous Citizens.</P>
