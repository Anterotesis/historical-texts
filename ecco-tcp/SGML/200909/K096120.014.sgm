<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> General Divi&s;ion of the Country; Mountains, Rivers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of the Turki&s;h provinces in Europe, we &s;hall now treat of tho&s;e in A&s;ia; which are &s;ituated between the twenty-&s;eventh and forty-fifth degrees of longitude, and the thirtieth and forty-&s;ixth degrees of N. latitude. They are bounded by Tartary and the Black Sea, on the North; by Per|&s;ia, on the Ea&s;t; by Arabia and the Levant, on the South; and by the Helle&s;pont and the Archipelago, on the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The principal mountains in A&s;iatic Turkey, are, Olympus, Ida, Taurus, Anti-Taurus, and tho&s;e of Caramania or Cilicia; all of them &s;ituated in Natolia,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
or Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia; Mount Cauca&s;us, now called the mountains of Dagi&s;tan; the mountains of Armenia, among which is Mount Ararat; the mountains of Curdi&s;tan, or A&s;&s;yria, which lie between Per&s;ia and Turkey; and the mountains of Pale&s;tine, particularly Hermon and Lebanon.</P>
<P>The &s;eas bordering on this country, are, the Euxine, or Black Sea; the Bo&s;phorus of Con&s;tantinople; the Propontis, or &s;ea of Marmora; the Helle&s;pont, and the Aegean &s;ea, or Archipelago, which divide A&s;ia from Europe; and the Levant, or White Sea, as the Turks call it, being the Ea&s;t end of the Mediter|ranean; to which may be added, the gulf of Per&s;ia, or Ba&s;&s;ora: the&s;e &s;eas, and the Red Sea, which divides A&s;ia from Africa, make part of the grand Signior's titles; who &s;tiles him&s;elf Lord of the Black, White, and Red Seas. Never was a country more advan|tageou&s;ly &s;ituated for navigation, and foreign traffic; all the merchandize of China and India, being brought up the Red Sea, and the gulf of Per&s;ia, and, by the other &s;eas, di&s;tributed to all the countries in this quar|ter of the globe.</P>
<P>The chief rivers are, the Euphrates, Tigris, Oron|tes, Maeander, Sarabat, Halys, Kara, and Jordan. The Euphrates and Tigris ri&s;e in the North, and, taking their cour&s;e South-ea&s;t, inclo&s;e that fine plain
<PB N="5" REF="6">
in Me&s;opotamia, now called Diarbeck; which, by &s;ome, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the &s;eat of Paradi&s;e. Certain it is, that the city of Babylon, the large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful city that ever &s;tood upon the earth, was &s;ituated in this province, on both banks of the Euphrates; the river running through the mid&s;t of it. The Euphrates and Tigris unite their &s;treams below Babylon; and then, dividing again, fall into the Per|&s;ian gulf, by &s;everal channels below Ba&s;&s;ora; from whence that &s;ea is often called the gulf of Ba&s;&s;ora. The city of Nineveh, little inferior to Babylon, &s;tood upon the Tigris; which, from its rapid &s;tream, ob|tained that name.</P>
<P>The river Orontes ri&s;es in Mount Hermon; and, running North-we&s;t, falls into the Levant &s;ea, a little below Antioch, which city &s;tands upon it. The river Maeander, now Madre, ri&s;es in Mount Taurus; and, running to the we&s;t, in a winding cour&s;e, falls into the Archipelago, near Ephe&s;us. From this river, all &s;er|pentine, or winding &s;treams, are called Maeanders. The river Sarabat ri&s;es in Natolia; and, running South-we&s;t, falls into the Archipelago, North of Smyrna. As to the little river Granicus, where <HI>Alexander</HI> ob|tained his fir&s;t victory over the Per&s;ians, it is &s;o &s;mall a &s;tream, that we &s;eldom &s;ee it on any map; but, from the concurrent relation of mo&s;t writers, it falls into the Helle&s;pont to the Ea&s;tward of Alydos, or the Dar|danells.
<PB N="6" REF="7">
The river Kara ri&s;es in Natolia Proper; and, running almo&s;t due Ea&s;t, falls into the Euphrates. The Jordan, which is &s;o named from two little &s;treams, Jor and Dan, ri&s;ing at the foot of Anti-Lebanus, and, after a cour&s;e of about twenty miles, uniting in one, is not a river of any great length, depth, or breadth, equal to its fame; its whole cour&s;e not being above 150 miles; its breadth not above twenty yards, and its depth not &s;ufficient for navigation. In its pa&s;&s;age into the Dead Sea, where it empties it&s;elf, it makes two lakes; the fir&s;t called Meron, of &s;mall extent, and dry in &s;ummer; the &s;econd, called the &s;ea of Gallilee, or the lake of Tiberias, or lake of Genezareth, one hundred furlongs in length, and forty in breadth.</P>
<P>The Dead Sea, as it is called, from a fal&s;e opinion, that it killed even the birds that flew over it, is, by experience, known not to de&s;erve &s;uch a terrible name; it is, indeed, extremely &s;alt, and the water &s;o &s;trong, that it will hardly admit a human body to &s;ink, and has a bituminous &s;tench; it is &s;aid that no fi&s;h, or other living creatures, can exi&s;t in this &s;ea; but, as fi&s;h-&s;hells are found on its &s;hore, there is rea&s;on to doubt the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. Its extent, from North to South, is &s;eventy miles, and &s;ixteen from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; it was formerly a plain, on which &s;tood the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and two others, de&s;troyed by fire from heaven.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="9">The principal provinces in A&s;iatic Turkey, are A&s;ia-Minor, or Natolia; Turcomania, or Armenia-Major; Georgia; Curdi&s;tan, or A&s;&s;yria; Diarbeck, or Me&s;o|potamia; Chaldaea; Syria; Pale&s;tine; Arabia Petraea, and Arabia De&s;erta; of each of which we &s;hall &s;peak in their turns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> A&s;ia-Minor.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin with A&s;ia-Minor, which lies op|po&s;ite to Con&s;tantinople. This province is bounded by the Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, and the Black Sea, to the North; by Georgia, and the river Euphra|tes, which divide it to the Ea&s;t, from Turcomania; on the South it is bounded by the Mediterranean, and by the Archipelago on the We&s;t.</P>
<P>A&s;ia-Minor is again &s;ub-divided into four parts; Na|tolia Proper, (the whole circle of A&s;ia-Minor, being &s;ometimes called Natolia) which contains the We&s;tern
<PB N="8" REF="10">
part; Ama&s;ia, the Northern; Aladulia, the Ea&s;tern; and Caramania, the Southern part.</P>
<P>Natolia Proper, which compri&s;es much the large&s;t &s;ub-divi&s;ion of A&s;ia-Minor, has in it many fine pro|vinces. This portion of A&s;ia-Minor has been &s;ub|divided, by ancient and modern geographers, into ten provinces. Pontus Paphalagoniae, Galatia, Phrygia Major, Lydia or Maenia, Doris, Caria, Ionia, Eolis, My&s;ia, comprehending Phrygia Minor and Bithynia.</P>
<P>The principal cities in the&s;e provinces, of which we propo&s;e to treat, ancient as well as modern, are Smyr|na, Ephe&s;us, Pru&s;a or Bur&s;a, Pergamus, Troy, Nice and Nicomedia; be&s;ides &s;ome others in this, and the re&s;t of the provinces of A&s;ia; which, though now in ruins, have been memorable in times pa&s;t, either for their &s;plendor, or as having been the birth-place of &s;ome great man of antiquity; or, for &s;ome other par|ticular worthy of being recorded. We &s;hall begin fir&s;t with Smyrna.</P>
<P>Smyrna is &s;ituated in 38 degrees of North latitude, at the extremity of a large bay in the Aegean &s;ea, op|po&s;ite to the i&s;land of Scio, and about eight days jour|ney by land from Con&s;tantinople. It is related of <HI>Alex|ander the Great,</HI> that, after hunting, he fell a&s;leep on Mount Pagus, beneath a plane-tree, which grew by a
<PB N="9" REF="11">
fountain near a temple of the <HI>Neme&s;es;</HI> and that the godde&s;s directed him in a vi&s;ion, to found there a city for the Smyrneans; a people of Ephe&s;us then living in villages. The work was begun by Antigonus, and fini&s;hed by Ly&s;imachus.</P>
<P>The &s;ite, &s;elected by <HI>Alexander</HI> for this people, was &s;uch as the ancient founders commonly preferred. Their cities, in general, were &s;eated by &s;ome hill, or mountain; which, as this did, &s;upplied them with mar|ble, and was commodious, as well for defence, as or|nament. The &s;ide or &s;lope, afforded a &s;ecure &s;itua|tion for the &s;eats of the &s;tadium and theatres, which ro&s;e from its quarry to advantage; and rendered the view as captivating as it was noble. The Greeks were, of old, accounted happy in chu&s;ing their &s;ituations. They were &s;tudious to unite beauty with &s;trength, and good ports with a fertile &s;oil. The Romans, on the con|trary, were attentive to articles neglected by them, to the paving of ways, to aqueducts, and common &s;hores.</P>
<P>Smyrna flouri&s;hed as <HI>Apollo</HI> had foretold; and, under the Romans, was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beautiful of the Ionian cities. The &s;treets were as &s;trait as the &s;ite would admit, and excellently di&s;po&s;ed. The ways were paved. Both above and below were large qua|drangular porticoes. There was al&s;o a library; and, be&s;ides the other requi&s;ites of a noble city, a port
<PB N="10" REF="12">
which &s;hut up; but, from an omi&s;&s;ion of the architects, the want of &s;ewers occa&s;ioned a great nui&s;ance. It was much frequented by the &s;ophi&s;ts; and, with Ephe&s;us, became renowned as a &s;chool of oratory and &s;cience. It has been exalted with high encomiums, and &s;tiled <HI>the lovely, the crown of Ionia, the ornament of A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The deva&s;tations committed in A&s;ia-Minor, and the changes effected by the rivers on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, have rendered Smyrna the only con&s;iderable mart by the &s;ea-&s;ide; and, in con&s;equence, the principal centre of the traffic of the country. One lucrative branch of its commerce failed, during the troubles in Per&s;ia, when the throne was u&s;urped by <HI>Nadir Shah.</HI> The accu&s;tomed communication by caravans was then in|terrupted; and trade, meeting with ob&s;tructions in the old cour&s;e, which it had held for ages, turned away into new channels. But, with this lo&s;s, Smyrna con|tinues a large and flouri&s;hing city. The bay, be&s;ides numerous &s;mall craft, is daily frequented by &s;hips of burthen, from the chief ports in Europe; and the fac|tors, who are a re&s;pectable body, live in affluence, and acquire fortunes.</P>
<P>The conflux at Smyrna, of people of various na|tions, differing in dre&s;s, in manners, in language, and in religion, is very con&s;iderable. The Turks occupy
<PB N="11" REF="13">
by far, the greater part of the towns. The other tribes live in &s;eparate quarters.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants, and Roman Catholics, have their chapels; the Jews, a &s;ynagogue or two; the Arme|nians, a large and hand&s;ome church with a burying ground by it. The Greeks, before the fire, had two churches. They applied, by their bi&s;hop at Con&s;tan|tinople, for leave to rebuild that which was de&s;troyed; but the &s;um demanded, was too exorbitant to be given.</P>
<P>The factors, and other Europeans &s;ettled at Smyrna, generally inter-marry with the Greeks, or with natives of the &s;ame religion. Their ladies wear the oriental dre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of large trow&s;ers, or breeches, which reach to the ancle; long ve&s;ts of rich &s;ilk, or of velvet, lined in winter with co&s;tly furs; and round their wai&s;ts, an embroidered zone, with cla&s;ps of &s;ilver or gold. Their hair is plaited, and de&s;cends down the back, often in great profu&s;ion. The girls have, &s;ome|times, above twenty thick tre&s;&s;es, be&s;ides two or three encircling the head as a coronet, and &s;et off with flowers and diamonds. They commonly &s;tain it of a che&s;nut colour, which is the mo&s;t admired. Their apparel and carriage are antique. It is remarkable, that the trow&s;ers are mentioned in a fragment of <HI>Sap|pho.</HI> The habit is light, loo&s;e, and cool, adapted to
<PB N="12" REF="14">
the climate. When they vi&s;it each other, they put over the head a thin tran&s;parent veil of mu&s;lin, with a border of gold ti&s;&s;ue. A jani&s;&s;ary walks before, and two, or more, handmaids follow them through the &s;treets. When a&s;&s;embled, they are &s;een reclined in various attitudes, or &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a &s;ofa. Girls of inferior rank from the i&s;lands, e&s;pecially Tino, abound; and are many of them as beautiful in per|&s;on, as picture&s;que in appearance. They excel in a glow of colour, which &s;eems the effect of a warm &s;un, ripening the human body, as it were, into uncommon perfection.</P>
<P>The principal buildings in Smyrna are the mo&s;ques, the public baths, the beze&s;ten, and the khans, or inns. The khans have, in general, a quadrangle or &s;quare area, and &s;ometimes a fountain in the middle. The upper &s;tory con&s;i&s;ts of an open gallery, with a range of apartments, and often a &s;mall mo&s;que. Below are the camels with their burthens, and the mules, or hor&s;es. A &s;ervant du&s;ts the floor of a vacant chamber when a traveller arrives; and, &s;preading a mat, which is all the furniture, leaves him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The &s;treets of Smyrna, a few excepted, are very narrow, and exceed|ing intricate.</P>
<P>The lofty mountains which &s;helter Smyrna, and leaves it only open to the &s;ea, concenter the rays of
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the &s;un, as it were, into a focus. The inten&s;e heat com|mences in June, and continues without intermi&s;&s;ion to the end of Augu&s;t, or the middle of September. During this period, if the <HI>inbat</HI> fail, the inhabitants are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and even pant for breath. The ground is then burnt up, and has large cha&s;ms and fi&s;&s;ures, which, as &s;ome have imagined, give vent to bitumi|nous vapours. The&s;e, if confined, are &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion earthquakes by their explo&s;ion. A year &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es without a &s;hock or two, but generally &s;light, and le&s;s hurtful than alarming. They happen chiefly in &s;pring and autumn, when the weather is calm; and it has been remarked at tho&s;e times, that the &s;ea commonly withdraws from the beach, and the water is unu&s;ually low. Be&s;ides this calamity, Smyrna is vi&s;ited almo&s;t annually by the plague. If the di&s;|temper rages, the con&s;uls and factors either retire into the country, or, as the phra&s;e is, <HI>&s;hut up;</HI> not admit|ting even the market-man to enter their gates. Many of the people abandon their dwellings, and live abroad in tents. The i&s;landers return home, and the &s;treets of the Frank's quarter, which is exceedingly po|pulous, almo&s;t cea&s;e to be trodden.</P>
<P>The Turks chiefly bury without the town, where the inclo&s;ures are very exten&s;ive; it being their cu&s;tom not to open the grounds filled with bodies, till a long term of years has elap&s;ed. In their cemetaries, and
<PB N="14" REF="16">
in tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tians and Jews, are found many marble &s;labs, and fragments of architecture. The Engli&s;h ground, which is at a di&s;tance from the Frank quarter, at the oppo&s;ite end of the town, is walled in; and contains &s;ome monuments worthy notice, for the beauty of their &s;culpture. The&s;e were brought from Italy. Mr. <HI>Bouverie,</HI> the friend and companion of Mr. <HI>Dawkins,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> is interred there and has over him a plain marble, with a long Latin in|&s;cription. He died at Magne&s;ia, by the Maeander.</P>
<P>Smyrna is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The &s;heep have broad tails, hanging down like an apron; &s;ome weighing eight, ten, or more pounds. The&s;e are eaten as a delicacy; and the fat, before they are full grown, accounted as delicious as marrow. The fle&s;h of wild hogs is common, and in e&s;teem among the Europeans and Greeks, who purcha&s;e the animal, when killed by the Turks. Fine fi&s;h is taken in the bay. Hares, with game and fowl, are cheap. The partridges are bigger than tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, of a different colour and &s;pecies, with red legs.</P>
<P>The olive-groves furni&s;h doves, field-fares, thru&s;hes, quails, &s;nipes, and the like, in abundance. A va|riety of excellent wines are produced in the country, or imported from the i&s;lands. The fruits are of an exqui&s;ite flavour. Among tho&s;e of the gourd kind,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the water-melon, which grows to a great &s;ize, is not only highly palatable, but &s;o innocent as to be allowed to the &s;ick in fevers. The figs are de&s;ervedly famous. The rich clu&s;ters of grapes are as whole&s;ome as beau|tiful. Many on the &s;talk, are found converted by the &s;un into rai&s;ins. Large and heavy bunches are hung on &s;trings, and pre&s;erved in the &s;hops for &s;ale in winter. Lemons and oranges, with citrons, are in great plenty. The &s;herbets made with the juice of the two former, newly gathered, in water &s;weetened with white honey, are as cooling as grateful to the ta&s;te. Coffee is brought from Arabia. We partook, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> from whom is extracted this account, almo&s;t daily, of eatables unknown to us before; and, in a &s;hort time, were reconciled to the cu&s;tom of &s;leeping after dinner, which is recommended as conducing, and even ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to health in that climate.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation was not, however, without grievances. We were much infected by a minute fly, which irri|tates by its puncture; and, &s;ettling on the white wall, eludes the angry pur&s;uer with &s;urprizing activity. But this &s;pecies, and the other in&s;ects which annoyed us, were petty offenders, compared with the mo&s;qui|toes, or large gnats, which tormented us mo&s;t exceed|ingly by their loud noi&s;e, and by repeated attacks upon our &s;kin, when it was naked, and lightly clothed; perforating it with their acute probo&s;cis, and &s;ucking
<PB N="16" REF="18">
our blood till they were full. A &s;mall fiery tumour then en&s;ues, which will not &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide, unle&s;s the patient has been here naturalized, as it were by re|&s;idence; but the pain is much allayed by lemon-juice. At night, they raged furiou&s;ly about our beds, a&s;&s;aulting the gauze veil, our defence; which, thin as it was, augmented the violent heat to a degree almo&s;t intolerable. Their fondne&s;s for foreign food, is generally but too vi&s;ible in the &s;wollen and di&s;torted features of per&s;ons newly arrived.</P>
<P>Smyrna has on the South-ea&s;t, a fine plain, in which are villages, and the hou&s;es of the principal factors, who re&s;ide in the country in &s;ummer. At the extre|mity of this plain, are the mountains. In the&s;e, wild animals abound, and e&s;pecially jackalls, which are nightly howling on the hills, or in the plain. When one begins, the re&s;t join, as it were, in full cry. Ca|meleons and lizards are commonly &s;een, about the rubbi&s;h of old buildings, ba&s;king in the &s;un; and &s;e|veral kinds of &s;nakes are found, &s;ome of great length, which are frequently di&s;covered by their mu&s;ty &s;mell.</P>
<P>The river Meles, was the ancient boa&s;t of the Smyr|neans. This mo&s;t beautiful water, as it has been &s;tiled, flowed by the city, and had its &s;ource not re|mote. The &s;tream is clear, and in &s;ummer &s;hallow,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;carce covering the rocky bed; and, winding in the deep valley behind the ca&s;tle, murmuring among the ever-greens. In winter, after heavy rains on the mountains, or the melting of the &s;now, it &s;wells into a torrent rapid and deep, often not fordable, or with danger.</P>
<P>The gulf of Smyrna, which has been computed about ten leagues long, is &s;heltered by hills, and affords &s;ecure anchorage. The mouth of the river Hermus, is within two leagues of the city. This river, with the Meander, was anciently famous for a fi&s;h called Glanis, and for mullet; which came up from the &s;ea in great numbers, particularly in &s;pring.</P>
<P>The fertility of the &s;oil by the river, has occa&s;ioned the &s;ettling of numerous villages, on that &s;ide of the gulf. Menimen, which is the principal, &s;upplies Smyrna with fruits, fi&s;h, and provi&s;ions; boats pa&s;&s;ing to and fro without intermi&s;&s;ion. The hills are en|livened by flocks of &s;heep and goats, and re&s;ound with the rude mu&s;ic of the lyre and pipe; the former, a &s;tringed in&s;trument, re&s;embling a guittar, and held much in the &s;ame manner, but u&s;ually played with a bow.</P>
<P>The port of Smyrna, is one of the fine&s;t in the Levant, and capable of containing the large&s;t fleet.
<PB N="18" REF="20">
There are &s;eldom fewer than an hundred ve&s;&s;els, of nations, at anchor in it. The circumference of the pre&s;ent city, is about four miles; it is nearly in the form of a triangle. The hou&s;es have very little beauty in them, being built very low, and in general with clay walls. The public buildings, however, have an air of great magnificence. Though the hou&s;es are low, the &s;treets are &s;pacious, and look like one con|tinued fair, where all kinds of merchandize of Europe and A&s;ia, is expo&s;ed to view, with all &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ions in great profu&s;ion. The hou&s;es of the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French con&s;uls, &s;tand near the &s;hore, and are very hand&s;ome buildings.</P>
<P>A ca&s;tle &s;tands at the entrance of the port, which commands all &s;hipping going in, and coming out. There is al&s;o a ruinous ca&s;tle in the upper part of the city, near a mile in circumference, built, according to tradition, by the Empre&s;s <HI>Helen;</HI> and near it, the re|mains of a palace, in which the Greek council was held; when Smyrna was the metropolis of Lower A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The walks about the town are exceedingly plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Frank-&s;treet, where are &s;everal little groves of lemon and orange-trees; which, being at all times clothed with blo&s;&s;oms and fruits, have a mo&s;t beautiful appearance. Through the&s;e gardens runs the river Melos, on who&s;e banks
<PB N="19" REF="21">
the Smyrneans have a tradition that <HI>Homer</HI> was born; though this honour is contended by Rhodes, Scio, Athens, and other places.</P>
<P>The vines, which cover the little hills round Smyrna, afford a delightful pro&s;pect, and a great quantity of grapes; of which &s;ome excellent wine is made.</P>
<P>Hunting and fi&s;hing, are two diver&s;ions which are very much followed by the inhabitants. It is very frequent for them to go out to fi&s;h in large parties; and after having caught a &s;ufficient quantity, and amu&s;ed them|&s;elves as long as they think proper, to land near &s;ome wood, into which they enter; and, after &s;preading a cloth, make their dinner of the fi&s;h they have caught, and whatever collation they have brought with them. In the&s;e parties, are &s;ometimes from twenty to thirty people. While they are at dinner, trumpets, French-horns, and other in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, are continually playing; after which, is generally &s;ome &s;ea-dance, or other diver&s;ion performed by the mariners.</P>
<P>The merchants continually form &s;uch parties as the&s;e, either on the water, or to go a few miles in the country, which, the cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions, makes it very rea&s;onable. In &s;hort, at Smyrna, there may be &s;aid to be every thing that can gratify the &s;en&s;es, and make life plea&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">The trade of this city is very con&s;iderable. It is chiefly carried on by the Engli&s;h and Dutch. The chief articles, which the inhabitants wear, are cotton, camels' &s;kins, and &s;tuffs made of the &s;ame, &s;uch as water-camlets, of a very glo&s;&s;y &s;hining colour. The&s;e are &s;old for &s;ixty crowns a piece, and &s;ometimes more.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a commerce carried on with Per&s;ia, by the caravans, which arrive in February, July, and October. The journey from Per&s;ia to Smyrna, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> takes up about &s;even months.</P>
<P>The reports of the population of this city vary very much. Some writers make it to con&s;i&s;t of eighty thou&s;and inhabitants, others not &s;o much.</P>
<P>Forty miles South of Smyrna, &s;tands the remains of the ancient and celebrated city of Ephe&s;us. The&s;e two cities have been termed the eyes of A&s;ia-Minor. It is very plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon a fine haven, near the mouth of the river Cay&s;ter. Under the Romans, it was the metropolis of A&s;ia. Here &s;tood the cele|brated temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> e&s;teemed one of the wonders of the world, and which <HI>Ero&s;tratus</HI> burnt to perpe|tuate his memory, the night that <HI>Alexander</HI> was born. Many grand ruins &s;till remain; &s;ome of which, are merely conjectured, by writers, to be the remains
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of the &s;econd temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> there having been a &s;econd temple erected to the honour of that godde&s;s, and built in a &s;tile of magnificence more glorious than that of the former.</P>
<P>Near the aqueduct, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> we met with a curious memorial of the great re&s;pect paid to the god|de&s;s of the Ephe&s;ians. It was one of their decrees in&s;cribed on a &s;lab of white marble, purporting, that an entire month &s;hould be held &s;acred, and &s;et apart to the godde&s;s; and that, during this whole month, nothing &s;hould be attended to by the Ephe&s;ians, but fe&s;tivals and public games.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o very vi&s;ible remains of an aque|duct, a circus, and a theatre; that theatre, in which the preaching of St. <HI>Paul</HI> produced &s;uch a tumult, that the people ru&s;hed in and &s;houted, 'Great is <HI>Diana</HI> of the Ephe&s;ians.'</P>
<P>The curious reader, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> will a&s;k what is become of the renowned temple of <HI>Diana?</HI> Can a wonder of the world be vani&s;hed like a phantom, without leaving a trace behind? We would give a &s;a|tisfactory an&s;wer to &s;uch queries; but, to our great regret, we &s;earched for the &s;ite of this fabric, to as little purpo&s;e as the travellers who have preceded us.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">The de&s;truction of &s;o illu&s;trious an edifice, de&s;erved to have been carefully recorded by cotemporary hi&s;|torians. We may conjecture, it followed the triumph of chri&s;tianity. The Ephe&s;ian reformers, when autho|ri&s;ed by the Imperial edicts, rejoiced in the oppor|tunity of in&s;ulting <HI>Diana,</HI> and deemed it piety to de|moli&s;h the very ruin of her habitation. Hence, per|haps, while the columns of a Corinthian temple have owed their pre&s;ervation to their bulk, tho&s;e of this fabric, with the va&s;t architraves, and all the ma&s;&s;ive materials have peri&s;hed, and are con&s;umed. Though its &s;tones were far more ponderous, and the heap larger beyond compari&s;on, the whole is gone, we know not how, or whither. An ancient author has de&s;cribed it, as &s;tanding at the head of the port, and &s;hining as a meteor. We may add, that as &s;uch too it has &s;ince di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>This temple, was reckoned the fir&s;t in Ionia, for magnitude and riches. The architect employed, was the famous projector, who propo&s;ed the forming of Mount Athos, when he had fini&s;hed, into a &s;tatue of <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> It was 420 feet long, and 220 broad. Of the columns, which were &s;ixty feet high, 127 were donations from kings. The order was Ionic, and it had eight columns in front. The folding doors, or gates, had been continued four years in glue, and were made of cypre&s;s-wood, which had been trea&s;ured
<PB N="23" REF="25">
up for four generations, highly poli&s;hed. The ceiling was of cedar. The whole altar was, in a manner, full of the works of <HI>Praxiteles.</HI> The offerings were in|e&s;timable, and among them was a picture by <HI>Apelles,</HI> repre&s;enting <HI>Alexander</HI> armed with thunder, for which he was paid twenty talents of gold, or near forty thou&s;and pounds. The &s;tructure was &s;o wonderfully great in its compo&s;ition, and &s;o magnificently adorned, that it appeared the work of beings more than human. The &s;un, it is affirmed, beheld in his cour&s;e, no object of &s;uperior excellence, or worthier of admiration.</P>
<P>A writer, who lived toward the end of the &s;econd century, has cited a &s;ybil, as foretelling, that the earth opening and quaking, the temple of <HI>Diana</HI> would be &s;wallowed, like a &s;hip in a &s;torm, into the aby&s;s; and <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> lamenting and weeping by the river-banks would enquire for it, then inhabited no more. If the authenticity of the oracle were undi&s;puted, and the &s;ibyl acknowledged a genuine prophete&s;s, we might infer from the vi&s;ible condition of the place, the full accompli&s;hment of the whole prediction. We &s;eek in vain for the temple; the city is pro&s;trate; and the godde&s;s gone.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent inhabitants of this once magnificent city, are only a few Greek pea&s;ants, living in extreme wretchedne&s;s, dependance, and in&s;en&s;ibility: the re|pre&s;entations
<PB N="24" REF="26">
of an illu&s;trious people, and inhabiting the wreck of their greatne&s;s; &s;ome, beneath the vaults of the &s;tadium; and &s;ome by the abrupt precipice, in the &s;epulchres, which received the a&s;hes of the dead.</P>
<P>Such are the pre&s;ent citizens of Ephe&s;us, and &s;uch is the condition to which that renowned city has been gradually reduced. It was a ruinous place, when the emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> filled Con&s;tantinople with its &s;tatues, and rai&s;ed his church of St. <HI>Sophia</HI> on its columns. Since then, it has been almo&s;t quite ex|hau&s;ted. Its &s;treets are ob&s;cured and overgrown. A herd of goats was driven to it for &s;helter, from the &s;un at noon; and a noi&s;y flight of crows from the quarries, &s;eemed to in&s;ult its &s;ilence. The glorious pomp of its heathen wor&s;hip is no longer remem|bered; and chri&s;tianity, which was there nur&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, and fo&s;tered by general councils, until it increa&s;ed to fulne&s;s of &s;tature, barely lingers on, in an exi&s;tence hardly vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Bur&s;a is one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t towns of Turkey in A&s;ia, the capital of the ancient Bithynia, and extends it&s;elf from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, at the foot of Mount Olympus, and on the edge of a fine exten&s;ive plain, full of mulberry and other fruit-trees. So many &s;prings proceed from Mount Olympus, that every hou&s;e has its own fountain. The mo&s;ques are very
<PB N="25" REF="27">
elegant and numerous, they are covered with lead, and adorned with domes; as are al&s;o the caravan|&s;ara's, which are very hand&s;ome and commodious. The Bege&s;tein, is a large &s;tructure full of warehou&s;es and &s;hops, containing all the commodities of the Ea&s;t, be&s;ides their own manufactures in &s;ilk. Here are the be&s;t workmen in all Turkey; they are excellent imi|tators of the tape&s;try of Italy and France. This place is, in general, very plea&s;ant; and the quarter of the Bazars, is well paved and neat. It contains above forty thou&s;and Turks; four hundred families of Jews; five hundred of Armenians, and three hundred of Greeks. None but Mu&s;&s;ulmen are permitted to dwell in the city; but the &s;uburbs, which are much more beautiful, and better peopled, are filled with Jews, Armenians, and Greeks. The Jews came hither from Granada, and &s;peak good Spani&s;h to this day. The inhabitants have excellent wine, and other provi&s;ions in great plenty. It was the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h emperors, before they pa&s;&s;ed into Europe. The palace of the grand &s;ignior is &s;till remaining, though in a ruinous &s;tate, and &s;tands on a high road encircled by a double wall. The &s;epulchres of the fir&s;t Turki&s;h emperors, and their &s;ultanas, are al&s;o &s;till to be &s;een in &s;mall chapels covered with domes.</P>
<P>The celebrated baths of <HI>Calip&s;o,</HI> are little more than a mile from the city. The&s;e baths are in &s;uch
<PB N="26" REF="28">
fame, for the cures they have effected, that many peo|ple re&s;ort to them from very remote provinces. The water in &s;ome of them is &s;o hot, that it mu&s;t be mixed with a con&s;iderable quantity of cold to be &s;upportable. The con&s;truction of the&s;e baths, is nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e we have already de&s;cribed, and the manner of bathing in them the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In this province are &s;everal other towns, now re|duced to villages, which were formerly flouri&s;hing and important cities. Among others, Chalcedon, near Scutari, is now a mi&s;erable village; though, in for|mer times, it was a great city, and the re&s;idence of the fourth general council.</P>
<P>Nicomedia, a little to the South of Chalcedon, was once the capital of Bithynia, and is &s;till a town of &s;ome commerce, delightfully &s;ituated in a fertile country. Mo&s;t of the Turki&s;h navy are built here. It received its name from <HI>Nicomedes,</HI> king of Bithynia, who added con&s;iderably to its improvement. The ruins of this city, &s;ays <HI>Motraye,</HI> &s;hew, that it once covered more ground, than either Con&s;tantinople, or even London.</P>
<P>Nice, to the South-ea&s;t of the above city, is al&s;o very large and populous, and carrying the remains of &s;till greater extent. Here <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> a&s;&s;embled the fir&s;t general council; and, in this city the Greek Em|perors
<PB N="27" REF="29">
re&s;ided, after Con&s;tantinople was taken from them by the Latins.</P>
<P>Lybu&s;&s;a is memorable for the death of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> who cho&s;e to put a period to his exi&s;tence, rather than deliver him&s;elf up to his mortal enemy, the king of Nicomedia. It lies between this latter city and Chalcedon.</P>
<P>The province of Phrygia-Minor, adjoining to Bi|thynia, contains the ruins of &s;everal once celebrated cities; particularly Lamp&s;acus, Troy, Troas, Alex|andria, and Pergamos.</P>
<P>Of Lamp&s;acus, now a &s;mall town at the entrance of the Dardanells, it is related, that <HI>Alexander</HI> having de|voted it to de&s;truction, and being informed, the in|habitants were coming to implore his mercy, that he would &s;pare their city, &s;wore, that he would reject their petition, with which the inhabitants being made acquainted, addre&s;&s;ed him to de&s;troy their city; and it was &s;aved by this &s;tratagem; this great hero, think|ing that his oath ought not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Of Troy, rendered memorable by <HI>Homer, Virgil,</HI> and other poets, for the ten years &s;iege it &s;u&s;tained, again&s;t the united power of the Greeks, according to &s;everal writers, &s;ome magnificent ruins remain; but, we &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e ruins are tho&s;e of Troas Alex|andria,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
one of the eighteen cities erected by <HI>Alexander the Great. Chandler</HI> ob&s;erves, that &s;everal travellers have imagined this was the &s;ite of Ilium, or Troy. The &s;iege of Troy, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened about the year of the world 2816; before Chri&s;t 1184 years. At Sigaeum, built on its ruins, are two barrows &s;tanding, each in a vineyard. One, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> was that of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus;</HI> the other was that of <HI>Antilochus,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Ne&s;tor.</HI> We had like|wi&s;e in view, the barrow of <HI>Ajax Telamon;</HI> and at a di&s;tance from it, that of <HI>Ae&s;ytes,</HI> mentioned in <HI>Homer;</HI> but of the ruins of Troy he makes no mention.</P>
<P>Alexandria Troas, (we take our de&s;cription from <HI>Chandler</HI>) was begun by <HI>Antigonus,</HI> and from him fir&s;t called Antigonia; but <HI>Ly&s;imachus,</HI> to whom, as a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of <HI>Alexander,</HI> it devolved, changed its name in honour of the decea&s;ed king.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> in&s;tead of making his progre&s;s by deva&s;tations, wi&s;ely provided more la&s;ting and ho|nourable monuments of his pa&s;&s;age through the coun|tries which he &s;ubdued; cau&s;ing cities and temples to be erected, and forming plans for their future pro&s;|perity. As his &s;tay was commonly &s;hort, the exe|cution of his noble de&s;igns was committed to the go|vernors, whom he appointed; men of grand ideas, fitted to &s;erve &s;o magnificent a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">In the war with <HI>Antiochus,</HI> Alexandria Troas was eminent for its fidelity to the Romans. Under <HI>Augu&s;|tus,</HI> it received a Roman colony, and increa&s;ed. It was then the only con&s;iderable place between Sigaeum, and Lectos, and was inferior to no city of its name, but Alexandria in Egypt.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian religion was planted early at Troas. In the beginning of the fifth century, the bi&s;hop <HI>Silvanus,</HI> was required to deliver a ve&s;&s;el from a demon, which was believed to detain it, as it could not be launched. It was intended for tran&s;porting &s;ome large columns, and was of great &s;ize. Going down to the beach, the bi&s;hop prayed; and taking hold of a rope, called to the multitude to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, when the &s;hip rea|dily obeyed him, and hurried into the &s;ea. Of the ruins of this city, there are &s;ome very con&s;iderable remains.</P>
<P>Pergamos, &s;ituated in the &s;ame province, between Troas and Smyrna, was once the capital of a large kingdom, of which <HI>Attalus</HI> was the la&s;t king; who, by his will, transferred his kingdom to the Romans, which gave that people an opportunity of intere&s;ting them|&s;elves in the affairs of the A&s;iatic princes. Here <HI>Galen,</HI> the celebrated phy&s;ician, was born. Parchment and tape&s;try, it is &s;aid, were fir&s;t made here; but it is more famous for a library collected by its kings, con|taining
<PB N="30" REF="32">
20,000 volumes, written on parchment. It was one of the &s;even churches threatened by St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>In the province of Galatia, is Ancyra, &s;ituated on the river Melus; near this city, which is at pre&s;ent one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Natolia, <HI>Pompey</HI> ob|tained a great victory over <HI>Mithridates;</HI> and, nearly on the &s;ame &s;pot, <HI>Bajazet</HI> was afterwards defeated by <HI>Tamerlane.</HI> The &s;treets are full of old marble pillars, &s;ome of which are of red porphyry, grained with white, and others of red and white ja&s;per. The hou&s;es are, for the mo&s;t part, built of clay; yet noble pieces of marble are frequently found to have been employed in the&s;e buildings, as al&s;o in the walls and towers of the city. The ca&s;tle has a triple wall, com|po&s;ed of large pieces of white marble and &s;tone, much re&s;embling porphyry. There are a great number of in&s;criptions in different parts of the town.</P>
<P>It is computed there are in Ancyra, 40,000 Turks, be&s;ides a great number of Greeks and Armenians. This city lies about five days journey South of the Black Sea.</P>
<P>In the country about Ancyra, there is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t breed of goats in the known world. They are milk-white, and their hair, which is as fine as &s;ilk, is
<PB N="31" REF="33">
curled, and eight or nine inches long. The fine &s;tuffs and camblots, made from their hair, is the principal manufacture of the country. But the&s;e goats are not to be met with above four or five days journey from this city; if they are carried further, they dege|nerate.</P>
<P>The two cities of Gordium and Colo&s;s, in Phrygia-Major, are reputed, the fir&s;t to have been the &s;eat of <HI>Gordius,</HI> king of Phrygia, who tied the famous knot in the temple of <HI>Apollo;</HI> which he predicted, that who|ever could unloo&s;en, would be &s;overeign of the whole world; and which <HI>Alexander,</HI> in vain attempting, cut with his &s;word. Colo&s;s, &s;ituated on the South &s;ide of the Maeander, is the city to which S. <HI>Paul</HI> addre&s;&s;ed one of his epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>Lydia is the province of which that rich and power|ful monarch <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> was king. The capital city is Sardes, &s;ituated on the river Pactolus, &s;eventy miles Ea&s;t of Smyrna: it hath now little remarkable, but very exten&s;ive ruins, though it was once the fine&s;t city in Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and one of the &s;even churches mentioned in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Lydia, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> was celebrated for its city Sardes, which was of great antiquity, though po&s;terior to the war of Troy. It was enriched by the fertility
<PB N="32" REF="34">
of the &s;oil, and the Acropolis was remarkable for its &s;trength. This was on a lofty hill; the back part, or that towards Tmolus, a perpendicular precipice. One of the kings, an ance&s;tor of <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> it is related, believed that, by leading a lion about the wall, he &s;hould render the fortre&s;s impregnable, and neglected that portion of it as totally inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> who was a tyrant, or king of all nations, within the river Halys, engaging <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who had fol|lowed him into Lydia, was defeated in the plain before the city; the Lydian hor&s;es not enduring the &s;mell of the camels. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then be&s;ieged him, and offered a reward for the per&s;on who &s;hould fir&s;t mount the wall. One of his &s;oldiers had &s;een a Lydian de&s;cend for his helmet, which had rolled down the back of the Acro|polis. He tried to a&s;cend there, where not even a centinel was placed, and &s;ucceeded. Afterwards the Per&s;ian Satrapas, or commandant, re&s;ided at Sardas, as the emperor did at Su&s;a.</P>
<P>The city and acropolis, &s;urrendered on the ap|proach of <HI>Alexander,</HI> after the battle of the Granicus. Under the Romans, Sardes was a large city, and not inferior to any of its neighbours, until the terrible earthquake, which happened in the time of <HI>Tiberius Coe&s;ar.</HI> Magne&s;ia, Philadelphia, Laodicea, Ephe&s;us, and &s;everal more cities partook largely in that cala|mity;
<PB N="33" REF="35">
but this place &s;uffered prodigiou&s;ly, and was much pitied.</P>
<P>The principal towns that we &s;ee any account of, in the province of Caria, are Miletus, and Halicar|na&s;&s;us.</P>
<P>Miletus, &s;ituated near the &s;ea, on the North &s;ide of the Maeander, was once a town of great fame, but at pre&s;ent is only a village.</P>
<P>Miletus, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> is now a very mean place, but &s;till called Palat, or Palatia, <HI>the palaces.</HI> The principal relic, of its former magnificence, is a ruined theatre, which is vi&s;ible afar off, and was a mo&s;t capa|cious edifice, mea&s;uring 457 feet long. The exter|nal face of this va&s;t fabric is marble. On the &s;ide of the theatre next to the river, is an in&s;cription in mean characters, rudely cut, in which, <HI>"The city Miletus"</HI> is mentioned &s;even times. This is a monument of here|tical Chri&s;tianity. One <HI>Ba&s;ilides,</HI> who lived in the &s;econd century, was the founder of an ab&s;urd &s;ect, called Ba&s;ilidians and Gno&s;tics, the original proprietors of the many gems, with &s;trange devices and in&s;crip|tions, intended to be worn as amulets, or charms; with which the cabinets of the curious now abound. One of their idle tenets was, that the appellative <HI>"Jehovah,"</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ingular virtue and efficacy.
<PB N="34" REF="36">
They expre&s;&s;ed it by the &s;even Greek vowels, which they tran&s;ported into a variety of combinations. The &s;uper&s;tition appears to have prevailed, in no &s;mall de|gree, at Miletus. In this remain the my&s;terious name is frequently repeated, and the deity &s;ix times invoked, <HI>"Holy Jehovah, pre&s;erve the town of the Mile&s;ians, and all the inhabitants."</HI> The archangels al&s;o are &s;um|moned to be their guardians, and the whole city is made the author of the&s;e &s;upplications; from which, thus engraved, it was expected, as may be pre&s;umed, to derive la&s;ting pro&s;perity, and a kind of tali&s;manical protection.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ite of the town, to a great extent, is &s;pread with rubbi&s;h, and over-run with thickets. The ve&s;tiges of the heathen city, are pieces of wall, broken arches, and a few &s;cattered pede&s;tals and in&s;criptions; a &s;quare marble urn, and many wells. One of the pede&s;tals has belonged to a &s;tatue of the emperor <HI>Hadrian,</HI> who was a friend to the Mile&s;ians; as appears from the title of &s;aviour and benefactor be&s;towed on him. Another has &s;upported the emperor <HI>Severus,</HI> and has a long in&s;cription, with this curious pre|amble. "The &s;enate and people of the city of the Mile&s;ians, the fir&s;t &s;ettled in Ionia, and the mother of many and great cities, both in Pontus and Egypt, and in various other parts of the world." Some fragments of ordinary churches are inter&s;per&s;ed among the ruins;
<PB N="35" REF="37">
and traces remain of an old fortre&s;s erected upon the theatre; beneath which, is a &s;quare inclo&s;ure, de|&s;igned, it &s;eems, as a &s;tation for an armed party to di&s;|pute, or defend the pa&s;&s;age of the river.</P>
<P>From the number of for&s;aken mo&s;ques, it is evident, that Mahometani&s;m had flouri&s;hed in its turn, at Mi|letus. All the&s;e have been mean buildings, and mere patch work; but one, a noble and beautiful &s;tructure of marble, is in u&s;e; and the dome, with a tall palm|tree or two, towers amid the ruins of &s;ome low flat|roofed cottages, inhabited by a very few Turki&s;h fami|lies, the pre&s;ent citizens of Miletus.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this place, after the declen&s;ion of the Greek empire, is very imperfect. The whole re|gion has undergone frequent ravages from the Turks. One &s;ultan, in 1175, &s;ent 20,000 men, with orders to lay wa&s;te the Roman provinces, and bring him &s;ea|water, &s;and, and an oar. All the cities on the Maean|der, and on the coa&s;t, were then ruined. Miletus was again de&s;troyed towards the end of the thirteenth cen|tury, by the conquering <HI>Othman.</HI></P>
<P>This city was once exceedingly powerful and il|lu&s;trious. Its early inve&s;tigators extended its com|merce to remote regions. The whole Euxine &s;ea, the Propontis, Egypt, and other countries, were fre|quented
<PB N="36" REF="38">
by its &s;hips, and &s;ettled by its colonies. It boa&s;ted a venerable band of memorable men; among the re&s;t, <HI>Hecatoeus,</HI> an early hi&s;torian; and <HI>Thales,</HI> the father of philo&s;ophy. It with&s;tood <HI>Darius,</HI> and re|fu&s;ed to admit <HI>Alexander.</HI> It has been &s;tiled the me|tropolis, and head of Ionia; the bulwark of A&s;ia; chief in war and peace; mighty by &s;ea; the fertile mother, which had poured forth her &s;ons to every quarter, counting not fewer than &s;eventy-five cities de&s;cended from her. It afterwards fell &s;o low, as to furni&s;h a proverbial &s;aying, "The Mile&s;ians were once great;" but, if we compare its ancient glory, and its &s;ub&s;equent humiliation with its pre&s;ent &s;tate, we may ju&s;tly exclaim, "Miletus, how much lower art thou now fallen!"</P>
<P>At Ura, twenty-two miles from Miletus, and about two miles and a half from the &s;hore, are the ruins of a famous temple, dedicated to <HI>Apollo Didy|meus.</HI> It is approached by a gentle a&s;cent, and &s;een afar off; the land towards the &s;ea lying flat and level. The memory of the plea&s;ure which this &s;pot afforded me, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> will not be &s;oon, or ea&s;ily, era&s;ed. The columns, yet entire, are &s;o exqui&s;itely fine; the marble ma&s;s &s;o va&s;t and noble, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, perhaps, to conceive greater beauty and maje&s;ty of ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">Of Halicarna&s;&s;us nothing is extant but the ruins. No part of the tomb, erected by queen <HI>Artime&s;ia,</HI> for her hu&s;band <HI>Mau&s;olus,</HI> is now remaining; though for|merly e&s;teemed one of the fine&s;t &s;tructures in the world. In this city <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> were born.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ia, another di&s;trict in A&s;ia-Minor, containing &s;everal provinces, and bounded by the Euxine &s;ea on the North, and by Armenia and Georgia on the Ea&s;t, has few places of any celebrity.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ia, a town of the &s;ame name, &s;ituated near the banks of the river Iris, is the re&s;idence of the Turki&s;h viceroy; and was anciently that of the kings of Cap|padocia. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on an eminence, from whence there is a pro&s;pect over an exten&s;ive plain. The buildings are mean, nor is it a place of much commerce; but there are &s;ome magnificent ruins, where the palaces of the ancient princes &s;tood. The Greeks have an archbi&s;hop. The be&s;t wines, and be&s;t fruits in Natolia, are to be met with here. It is al&s;o celebrated in having been the birth-place of <HI>Strabo.</HI></P>
<P>Tocat, a very populous city, is &s;ituated about a hun|dred miles South of the Black Sea. There is a con|&s;iderable manufacture carried on here, of yellow Tur|key
<PB N="38" REF="40">
leather. The Armenians, who inhabit this city, are mo&s;tly mechanics, being employed in copper, and other hardware. The Chri&s;tians make excellent wine here, and the adjacent country abounds in different kinds of fruits. Saffron is produced here in con&s;ide|rable quantity. It is al&s;o the grand thoroughfare for the caravans, which come from Turkey, and are bound for Per&s;ia, Arabia, and India. The Amazons, if ever there were &s;uch a people, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have re&s;ided in this part of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>According to other writers, who give a more par|ticular de&s;cription of this city; it contains near 30,000 inhabitants. The hou&s;es are well built, and two &s;tories in height. The city is in the form of an am|phitheatre, which gives it a &s;ingular appearance. The &s;treets are well paved, a circum&s;tance very unu&s;ual in A&s;iatic cities. The &s;treams are &s;o abundant, that each hou&s;e here, has al&s;o its fountain. Be&s;ides the &s;ilk of this country, they manufacture eight or ten loads of that of Per&s;ia, and make it into &s;ewing &s;ilk. Their chief trade is in copper ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch as kettles, drink|ing cups, lanthorns and candle&s;ticks. This city may be looked upon as the center of trade in Natolia.</P>
<P>Trebi&s;ond is a large, populous, and &s;trong town, &s;ituated on the &s;hore of the Euxine &s;ea. Within the walls are groves and gardens, intermixed with hou&s;es.
<PB N="39" REF="41">
It is &s;eated at the foot of a very &s;teep hill, and the walls are &s;quare and high with battlements. They are built with the ruins of ancient &s;tructures, on which there are in&s;criptions, but not legible. It had a &s;trong ca&s;|tle built on a rock for its defence, but now much de|cayed; the harbour, which lies at the Ea&s;t end of the city, was formerly e&s;teemed a very good one; but is, at pre&s;ent, &s;o blocked up, that &s;hips cannot enter it.</P>
<P>The &s;uburbs, which are larger than the city, are in|habited by Greeks and Armenians. The country is not fruitful, and the trade is much on the decline. It was &s;ubject to the Roman and Greek emperors; but in 1209, the &s;overeignty of it was u&s;urped by <HI>David Commenus,</HI> a Frenchman, who took upon him&s;elf the title of Duke. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, <HI>John Commenus,</HI> a&s;|&s;umed that of emperor; and his de&s;cendants remained &s;overeigns of the city, and the adjacent country, till the year 1460, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. took it, and put to death <HI>David Commenus,</HI> the la&s;t emperor; and the Turks &s;till continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Turcomania, Curdi&s;tan, and Diarbeck.</HEAD>
<P>THE province of Turcomania, the ancient Arme|nia, is &s;ituated North of Diarbeck and Curdi&s;|tan; having Media on the Ea&s;t, and Natolia on the We&s;t. The chief cities arc Erzerom and Cars.</P>
<P>The city of Erzerom, the capital, is &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, in forty-one degrees of longitude, and forty of latitude. It is about two miles in cir|cumference, and &s;urrounded by a double wall. The inhabitants con&s;i&s;t of twenty thou&s;and Turks, and &s;ix thou&s;and Armenians. Mo&s;t of the Turks, though or|dinary trade&s;men, are called Jani&s;&s;aries, from having given a &s;um of money to the Aga, to be enrolled as &s;uch.</P>
<P>The Greeks and Armenians have each their bi&s;hop. They are, for the mo&s;t part, artificers, and employed in the leather and copper manufactures; the moun|tains near the city, being rich in copper, together with
<PB N="41" REF="43">
&s;ome &s;ilver ore. The&s;e mountains, are generally co|vered with &s;now till mid&s;ummer; the air in winter is exceedingly cold; and the vallies in &s;ummer are as much too hot; the weather, hereabouts, frequently changing from violent heat to the oppo&s;ite extreme, which is the more in&s;upportable, as there is &s;carco any fewel in the country; there is neither tree nor bu&s;h to be &s;een for many miles; their firing, there|fore, is cow-dung, and other &s;tinking materials which taint the air, and &s;poil the food dre&s;&s;ed with it. Their commerce is chiefly in furs, and they have a bri&s;k fo|reign trade; the caravans pa&s;&s;ing through this city, in their way to Con&s;tantinople, in order to avoid the Arabs, whom they are in danger of encountering, when they proceed in a direct line to Aleppo. In this city is collected the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e dues, on all mer|chandize that pa&s;&s;es through the country. They &s;el|dom enter into particulars, but charge them by the lump, according to their weight. For in&s;tance, twenty pounds are demanded for every camel-load, which is generally about eight hundred weight. Sometimes five per cent. is demanded for all merchandize ex|ported; and five crowns for each traveller.</P>
<P>Kars, or Cars, lies on a river of the &s;ame name, about one hundred miles Ea&s;t of Trebi&s;ond. It is two miles in circumference, and but thinly inhabited. The town is defended by a ca&s;tle, &s;ituated on an inac|ce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="42" REF="44">
rock; and, as it is a frontier town adjoining to Per&s;ia, it has a numerous garri&s;on, commanded by a ba&s;haw. The merchants complain much of the extor|tions practi&s;ed on them, when they pa&s;s through this city. The hou&s;es are very mean in their appearance, and look more like dens than the habitations of human beings.</P>
<P>The province of Curdi&s;tan, or A&s;&s;yria Proper, is divided between the Per&s;ians and the Turks. The We&s;tern part belonging to Turkey, is the lea&s;t, and lies between Per&s;ia on the Ea&s;t, and Diarbeck, or Me|&s;opotamia, on the We&s;t. This is a very mountainous country; but the hills are covered with good timber and herbage to their very &s;ummit, and the &s;oil in the vallies is well watered and fertile; but being a frontier province, it is not &s;o well cultivated as it might be. The people are chiefly &s;hepherds, who live in tents, and ramble from place to place, covering the country with their flocks and herds. They are a &s;ort of chri&s;tians, but are &s;aid to be very bruti&s;h, and much given to pil&s;ering tho&s;e who pa&s;s through their country, like the Arabs. But this is not to be wondered at, on the frontiers of two powerful king|doms at enmity with each other; and where people will take greater liberties than in other places.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">There are &s;carce any towns or villages in Curdi&s;tan. The hou&s;es lie di&s;per&s;ed at the di&s;tance of a mu&s;ket|&s;hot from each other; and, though they make no wine, there is &s;carce a hou&s;e without its vineyard.</P>
<P>In this country &s;tood the ancient city of Nineveh, on the ea&s;tern bank of the river Tigris. This city, ac|cording to <HI>Jonas,</HI> was &s;ixty miles in circumference. The walls of it are &s;aid to have been one hundred feet high, and the towers two hundred feet; of the&s;e it is recorded, there were eleven hundred and fifty. The hou&s;es did not &s;tand contiguous, but were &s;urrounded with large gardens and court-yards. It is &s;aid to have been built by <HI>Nimrod;</HI> but, according to &s;ome writers, by <HI>Ninus;</HI> from whom it is conjectured to have re|ceived its name. It held out a &s;iege of three years, again&s;t <HI>Arbaces,</HI> when the river overflowed twenty furlongs of the wall; on which <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> the king, retired into his palace, and having collected all his wealth, amounting to twenty thou&s;and millions of pounds, he &s;et fire to the whole, and threw him&s;elf into the flames. This city was afterwards entirely de&s;troyed by <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> and nothing is now to be &s;een, but heaps of rubbi&s;h along the river Tigris, where it formerly &s;tood, and which is imagined to be the re|mains of this great city.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">About two miles from the Tigris, on a &s;mall emi|nence, &s;tands a mo&s;que; on the &s;pot, where, accord|ing to tradition, <HI>Jonas</HI> was buried. The Turks have &s;uch a veneration for this mo&s;que, that they will &s;carce permit any Chri&s;tian to enter it.</P>
<P>The principal city in Curdi&s;tan, is Shera&s;oul, which lies to the Ea&s;t of Nineveh, in the 36th degree of La|titude. It is the &s;eat of the viceroy. The town is not large, but built in a &s;ingular manner; the hou&s;es being hewn out of a rock, or the &s;ide of a hill.</P>
<P>Arbela, to the Ea&s;t of Shera&s;oul, lies adjoining to a plain of fifteen leagues in extent. It was on this plain that <HI>Alexander</HI> defeated <HI>Darius.</HI> In the middle of the plain is a con&s;iderable eminence, covered with fine oaks; and on the &s;ummit a ca&s;tle, into which it is &s;aid, <HI>Darius</HI> went to view the engagement.</P>
<P>Betlis, in the northern part of this province, is a city who&s;e prince is independent, both of the Porte, and of Per&s;ia; the country here being very mountainous, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. The road up to the city is cut through a rock, being not more than ju&s;t wide enough to admit a camel to pa&s;s. It is built round the hill in &s;hape of a cone, and &s;tands at an equal di&s;tance from two other mountains. On the top is a plain where the Ca&s;tle &s;tands; and here the bey, or
<PB N="45" REF="47">
prince, has his palace. It is &s;aid he can rai&s;e five and twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and a large body of foot, from among the &s;hepherds in this province.</P>
<P>The province of Diarbeck, or Me&s;opotamia, lies between the Tigris and Euphrates; from which &s;itua|tion it is &s;aid to have obtained its name. It is bounded by Turcomania on the North, and Chaldaea on the South.</P>
<P>This province is, for the mo&s;t part, as fertile as any in the Turki&s;h empire. It abounds, particularly in the North part, with corn, wine, cattle, wild fowl, and every kind of provi&s;ions. There is a plea&s;ing va|riety of hills and vales, throughout the province; and it is almo&s;t entirely encircled by the Tigris and Eu|phrates, be&s;ides being watered by &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;treams.</P>
<P>The two principal cities in this province, are Orfa and Diarbeck. Orfa is &s;aid to be the capital. This city is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ancient Edi&s;&s;a; it lies in 36 degrees of North latitude. It is al&s;o &s;aid to have been the place where <HI>Abraham</HI> dwelt. The fir&s;t thing &s;hewn to &s;trangers, is a large fountain, who&s;e &s;prings ri&s;e under the principal mo&s;que. The Chri&s;tians have a tradition, that it was on this &s;pot that <HI>Abraham</HI> prayed,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
before he went to offer up his &s;on I&s;aac, and that two &s;prings of water aro&s;e from the place where he knelt.</P>
<P>The walls of this city are built of free-&s;tone, with towers at different di&s;tances; but the town is meanly built, and many parts of it unoccupied. There are &s;ome plea&s;ant gardens in the &s;uburbs, watered by ar|tificial canals, and the &s;oil produces good corn and wine; but what Orfa is mo&s;t remarkable for, is the manufacture of yellow Turkey leather, as it is called; the red being made at Diarbeck, and the blue at Tocat.</P>
<P>Diarbeck is &s;ituated in 42 degrees of Ea&s;t longitude, and 47 of North latitude, on the river Tigris, and not far from its &s;ource. It is built on an eminence, and the de&s;cent to the river is very &s;teep. The town is &s;urrounded by a double wall; on the outward wall, are &s;ixty ancient towers, and three gates; on every one of which is an in&s;cription in Greek, not intelligible at pre&s;ent, but repeating the name of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> &s;everal times. In this city is a magnificent mo&s;que, and &s;e|veral hand&s;ome &s;quares. It contains 20,000 Chri&s;|tian inhabitants, two thirds of which are Armenians&punc; be&s;ides a great number of Mahometans. About a league from the city, is a canal cut from the Tygris, which &s;upplies the town with water&punc; and it is in this water that all the red Turkey leather, made at Diar|beck,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
is wa&s;hed, and which &s;o much excels all others in colour. This manufacture employs, at lea&s;t, one-fourth of the inhabitants. The &s;oil in the environs of this city, is very good, and abounds in corn and wine. This city &s;tands &s;o near the &s;ource of the Tigris, that it is fordable here.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Irac-Arabi, and Georgia.</HEAD>
<P>THE province of Irac-Arabi, anciently called Chaldaea, lies on both &s;ides the river Euphrates and Tigris; having Per&s;ia on the Ea&s;t, and Arabia De&s;erta on the We&s;t. In this province, according to &s;ome writers, was the &s;eat of Paradi&s;e; and here &s;tood the tower of Babel, where language was fir&s;t con|founded.</P>
<P>The principal towns in this province are, Bagdad, Ba&s;&s;ora, and the ruins of Babylon and Selqucia.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">Bagdat, the capital, is &s;ituated in 43 degrees of Ea&s;t longitude, and 33 of North latitude, on the river Tygris. It was built by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. caliph of the Saracens, on the We&s;tern &s;ide of the river; and about the year 1100, another town was built on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, and both united by a bridge of boats; according to <HI>Hanway,</HI> the only communication the river will admit of, as it is broad and deep, and in its ordinary cour&s;e very rapid. At certain &s;ea&s;ons, it &s;wells to a prodi|gious height; and, overflowing the country, occa&s;ions many mora&s;&s;es on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the city.</P>
<P>The fortifications of this city are compo&s;ed of lofty thick walls, of brick, covered with earth; &s;trengthened by great towers in form of ba&s;tions, placed at certain di&s;tances, and protected by a deep ditch, which can be filled at any time by the waters of the Tigris. The citadel is on the North &s;ide, and commands the river. The whole fortification is furni&s;hed with near two hundred pieces of cannon. The garri&s;on generally con&s;i&s;ts of a body of two thou&s;and men; and in time of war, more than twice that number; be&s;ides the or|dinary militia, which is twelve thou&s;and men. The principal buildings are the palace of the viceroy, the mo&s;ques of which are five; and the cloy&s;ters which &s;urround the bazars, or market-places; and their bag|nios, all built by the Per&s;ians, when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bagdat. The cadi, who is principal eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and
<PB N="49" REF="51">
con&s;equently the chief judge, has great authority in this province. The Tefterdar, or trea&s;urer, who col|lects the public revenue, has al&s;o con&s;iderable influ|ence in the council; and the Reis Effendi, or &s;ecre|tary, who is &s;ometimes &s;tiled chancellor, is likewi&s;e an officer of great con&s;equence, and they are all of the viceroy's council; and a check on his admini&s;tration, over whom he has no authority; they being only ac|countable to the Divan at Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>Bo&s;&s;ora, or Ba&s;&s;ora, is &s;ituated in 47 degrees of Ea&s;t longitude, and 30 of North latitude, about three miles from the united &s;tream of the Euphrates, and the Tigris, with which it has a communication by a deep canal, the tide flowing between forty and fifty miles higher than the town, which is a great advantage to their navigation and foreign traffic. The walls of this town are twelve miles in circumference; within which, are many void &s;paces, fields and gardens. The &s;ituation of Ba&s;&s;ora, is not only extremely plea&s;ant, being &s;urrounded with fruitful fields and gardens; but it is, or at lea&s;t was, the be&s;t &s;ituated for trade of any city in the world; and is the mo&s;t ancient port-town, that hi&s;tory takes notice of, in that part of the world. The merchants of Ba&s;&s;ora, and tho&s;e of Tyre, were probably cotemporaries; or rather the cities of Tyre and Sidon, the chief Phenician ports, received the &s;pices, and other merchandize of the Ea&s;t, from Ba&s;|&s;ora,
<PB N="50" REF="52">
to which port they were fir&s;t brought by land, on the backs of camels; and afterwards by &s;ea up the gulf of Per&s;ia; and from that gulf, up the river Euphrates, to the end of the canal, which pre&s;erves the commu|nication between that river and the town. Four months in the year, the Indian merchants re&s;ort hither, viz. between the fir&s;t of July, and the end of October, when the Mon&s;oon &s;ets fair to bring them up the gulf; and, at this time, arrive the merchants from the We&s;t. In this &s;ea&s;on of the year, the town is crowded with traders from almo&s;t every part of the world.</P>
<P>It is not only the foreign trade that renders this town &s;o con&s;iderable, but its lying in the road from Per&s;ia to Mecca; through which, numerous cara|vans of pilgrims annually pa&s;s; who not only lay out con&s;iderable &s;ums for provi&s;ions, before they enter the de&s;art, but make a &s;ort of trading voyage, barter|ing the produce of their own country, for that of the countries they pa&s;s through; and their nobles, who are above this kind of traffic, by carrying a great train of officers and &s;ervants with them, &s;pend a great deal of money, which the Arabs find &s;o beneficial, that when the Per&s;ians began to take another route to Mecca, on account of &s;ome fre&s;h duties extorted be the Arabs, they invited them to proceed in their an|cient tract, and agreed to remit even mo&s;t of tho&s;e they u&s;ed formerly to demand.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">The greate&s;t prejudice to Ba&s;&s;ora, is the <HI>Samiel,</HI> or hot wind, that blows over this country annually, about Mid&s;ummer; at which time, many of the inhabitants, as well as foreigners, lo&s;e their lives. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> a traveller of credit, relates, that he knew four thou&s;and people de&s;troyed by it in one &s;ea&s;on; but, as this is the time of their fair, when multitudes of foreigners flock here, po&s;&s;ibly many of them might die of other di&s;ea&s;es. There is another di&s;temper which reigns here, about this time, occa&s;ioning &s;wellings in the groin, neck, and other parts of the body. This is not &s;o dangerous as the other; but were it much more &s;o, it is ob&s;ervable, that where merchants have a pro&s;|pect of great gain, nothing will deter them from vi&s;it|ing &s;uch places; as for example, their trading to Ben|coolen, in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and Porto-Bello, in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>This hot wind reigns from India, as far as the junc|tion of the Tigris and Euphrates; and &s;eems to be more fatal here than either in India or Per&s;ia; tho&s;e who breathe this air, frequently dying in an in&s;tant, as if &s;truck with lightning. <HI>Thevenot</HI> is of opinion, this is the wind mentioned by <HI>Job,</HI> it blowing always from the Ea&s;t; it &s;eems very evident, this hot wind is occa&s;ioned from its blowing over a tract of burning &s;and; as it is never felt upon the &s;ea, contiguous to tho&s;e countries, where it is &s;o fatal on the land.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">The environs of this city are beautiful. There are no finer pa&s;ture grounds to be met with in all A&s;ia; but the country, &s;ince it has been under the dominion of the Turks, is not &s;o well cultivated as it was in former times.</P>
<P>Georgia, of which we have &s;aid &s;omething before, is divided between the Per&s;ians and the Turks. Much the greater part is under the dominion of Per&s;ia. This is a very mountainous country, e&s;pecially the North part; the mountains, however, in general, are covered with fore&s;t-trees, fruit-trees, and herbage; and the &s;oil produces good corn, where it is cultivated; but the inhabitants are for the mo&s;t part &s;hepherds, living in tents, and ploughing no more than is &s;ufficient for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of the&s;e mountains, however, very high, and covered with &s;now great part of the year, which makes the air of this province very cold in winter; except in the vallies, and tho&s;e are, for the mo&s;t part, warm enough, and in &s;ummer exce&s;&s;ive hot.</P>
<P>In Turki&s;h Georgia may be comprehended Mon|grelia, Imeretta, and the South part of Circa&s;&s;ia; which countries are &s;ituated between 41 and 46 de|grees of Ea&s;tern longitude, and between 40 and 45

degrees of North latitude; lying in the form of a cre&s;cent, about the Ea&s;t end of the Euxine &s;ea. The chief towns are, Amarchia and Gonie. Of the&s;e towns we find nothing worthy of notice. The Georgians appear to lead a particular life, being di&s;|per&s;ed about the mountains, or in the vallies, and on the banks of rivers, in &s;cattered habitations.</P>
<P>The country is reputed to be very healthy, and the natives are of a good &s;tature, and their features and complexion, as well as their parts and genius, more admired than any people in the Ea&s;t.

<P>It has not only been the cu&s;tom of late years, for the Turks and Per&s;ians to furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;laves from this province; but, during the reign of their caliphs, the Egyptians formed their guards from the natives of this country; who, in time, became &s;o nu|merous, that they at la&s;t depo&s;ed the caliphs, u&s;urping the dominion of Egypt them&s;elves, under the name of Mamalukes, and even maintained them&s;elves on that throne, for &s;everal generations, not by hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; but, when a &s;ultan or caliph died, another popular &s;lave was elected &s;overeign from among them.
<PB N="54" REF="56">
It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Egyptians al&s;o pur|cha&s;ed female &s;laves, as well as males, from the Geor|gians. The Egyptian women have been &s;o celebrated for their beauty and wit, that we have many re|markable in&s;tances in hi&s;tory, particularly in <HI>Solomon,</HI> who adored his Egyptian wife, as well as her gods. <HI>Cleopatra</HI> made a conque&s;t, both of <HI>Coe&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Anthony;</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> was fonder of his Egyptian mi&s;tre&s;s, than of any of his wives or concubines. The rea&s;on gene|rally a&s;&s;igned, that the Turks are &s;uch comely and per&s;onable men, and their daughters &s;o fair, is their cohabiting with Georgian and Circa&s;&s;ian beauties; and the like may be conjectured of the Egyptians.</P>
<P>All that we can learn of the pre&s;ent government of Georgia is, that the Southern provinces are &s;ubject either to the Per&s;ians or the Turks; but, as to the Northern provinces, they are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, inde|pendent of either of the&s;e powers. They will, to &s;erve their turn, acknowledge them&s;elves &s;ubject, &s;ometimes to Turkey, and at others to Ru&s;&s;ia; but no dependance is to be placed upon them. By re|tiring to their mountains, they are, in a manner, out of their reach; and as it would be impracticable en|tirely to &s;ubdue them, &s;o it would be impolitic to at|tempt it; becau&s;e, if they found them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed by one of the&s;e powers, they would infallibly join the other. With re&s;pect to their internal government,

the country &s;eems divided into but two ranks, or orders, that of lords and &s;laves. The common people have no property in the lands, or goods they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and even their wives and children are the property of their re&s;pective lords, and may be &s;old by them at plea&s;ure. The lords them&s;elves, in their &s;everal &s;ub|divi&s;ions, have a chief, whom they acknowledge to be their &s;overeign, and po&s;&s;ibly may be a check upon his admini&s;tration, if he attempts to tyrannize, or oppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>With regard to the religion of the inhabitants of Georgia, there are a number of Mahometans; but much the greater part are Chri&s;tians, of the Greek and Armenian per&s;ua&s;ion; and it is the&s;e who are made &s;laves; the Turks giving free liberty to all tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;cribe to their religious tenets.</P>

<P>SYRIA lies to the We&s;tward of Diarbeck, or Me|&s;opotamia, from which it is &s;eparated from the Euphrates; having Natolia and Turcomania on the North, Arabia on the South, and the Mediterranean towards the We&s;t, in which limits are included, Phoe|nicia and Pale&s;tine.</P>
<P>This name of Syria, is an abridgment of A&s;&s;yria, fir&s;t adopted by the Ionians, who frequented tho&s;e coa&s;ts, after the A&s;&s;yrians of Nineveh had reduced that country to be a province of their empire; that is, about 750 years before Chri&s;t. The name of Syria, then comprehended neither Phoenicia, nor Pale&s;tine. The pre&s;ent inhabitants, who, according to the con|&s;tant practi&s;e of the Arabs, have not adopted the Greek names, call it <HI>Barrel-Sham,</HI> or country to the left. This country is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, only a chain of mountains, di&s;tributing them&s;elves in various di|rections

from one leading branch. The&s;e mountains, as they vary their levels and &s;ituations, are al&s;o greatly changed in their form and appearance.</P>
<P>It is an opinion generally received, that Syria is a very hot country; but it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;everal di&s;tinctions: fir&s;t, on account of the differ|ence of latitude, which, from one extremity to the the other, is not le&s;s than &s;ix degrees: &s;econdly, from the natural divi&s;ion of the country, into low and flat, and high and mountainous, which divi&s;ion occa&s;ions a &s;till more &s;en&s;ible difference; for, while <HI>Reaumeur</HI>'s thermometer &s;tands at 25 and 26 degrees upon the coa&s;t, it hardly ri&s;es to 20 or 21 among the moun|tains. In winter, therefore, the whole chain of mountains is covered with &s;now; while the lower country is always free from it, or at lea&s;t, it lies only for an in&s;tant. We mu&s;t, therefore, e&s;tabli&s;h two ge|neral climates, the one very hot, which is that of the coa&s;t, and the interior plains, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Balbech, Antioch, Tripoli, Acre, Gaza, &amp;c. the other tem|perate, and almo&s;t like our own, which is the climate of the mountains, at lea&s;t at a certain height.</P>
<P>In the mountains, the order of &s;ea&s;ons is nearly the &s;ame as in the middle provinces of France; the win|ter, which la&s;ts from November to March, is &s;harp and vigorous. Not a year pa&s;&s;es without &s;now, and
<PB N="58" REF="61">
the earth is frequently covered &s;everal feet deep with it for months together; the &s;pring and autumn are mild, but the &s;ummer heat is ab&s;olutely in&s;upportable. In the plains, on the contrary; as &s;oon as the &s;un returns to the equator, the tran&s;ition is rapid to op|pre&s;&s;ive heats, which continue to the end of October. But then the winter is &s;o moderate, that the orange, date, banana, and other delicate trees, flouri&s;h in the open air; and it appears equally extraordinary and picture&s;que, to an European at Tripoli, to behold under his windows in the month of January, orange-trees loaded with flowers and fruit, while the lofty head of <HI>Lebanon</HI> is covered with ice and &s;now.</P>
<P>Syria, therefore, unites different climates under the &s;ame &s;ky; and collects within a narrow compa&s;s, plea|&s;ures and productions, which nature has el&s;ewhere di&s;per&s;ed at greater di&s;tances from time and place. In Europe, &s;ea&s;ons are &s;eparated by months; here they are only &s;eparated by hours. If in Saide, or Tripoli, the inhabitants are incommoded by the heats of July, in &s;ix hours they are in the neighbouring mountains, and in the temperature of March; or, on the other hand, if chilled by the fro&s;ts of Decem|ber, in the mountains, a days journey brings them to the coa&s;t amid the flowers of May. The Arabian poets have therefore &s;aid, that the Sannen, (or peak of Lebanon) bears winter on his head, &s;pring upon
<PB N="59" REF="62">
his &s;houlders, and autumn in his bo&s;om, while &s;um|mer lies &s;leeping at his feet.</P>
<P>The winds in Syria, as in Egypt, are, in &s;ome de|gree, periodical, and governed by the &s;ea&s;ons. About the autumnal equinox, the North-we&s;t wind begins to flow more frequently and &s;tronger. It renders the air dry, clear, and &s;harp; and it is remarkable, that on the &s;ea-coa&s;t it cau&s;es the head-ach; but never in the mountains. This wind continues to prevail about fifty days, and is followed by the North-we&s;t, We&s;t, and South-we&s;t, which prevail from November to February. The two latter winds are, to u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the Arabs, <HI>the fathers of the rains.</HI> In March ari&s;e the pernicious winds from the Southern quarter, with the &s;ame circum&s;tances as in Egypt. Their duration, at each return, is u&s;ually three days. The ea&s;terly winds which follow, continue till June, when a North wind &s;ucceeds. At the &s;ea&s;on, the wind varies through all the points every day, pa&s;&s;ing with the &s;un from the Ea&s;t to the South; and from the South to the We&s;t, to return by the North, and re-commence the circuit. At this time al&s;o, a local wind called the land-breeze, prevails along the coa&s;t during the night; it &s;prings up after &s;un-&s;et, la&s;ts till &s;un-ri&s;ing, and reaches only two or three leagues out at &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">The cau&s;es of all the&s;e phaenomena, are problems well de&s;erving the attention of natural philo&s;ophers. No country is better adapted to ob&s;ervations of this kind, than Syria. It &s;eems as if nature had there pre|pared whatever is nece&s;&s;ary, to the &s;tudy of her ope|rations. We, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> in our foggy climates, in the depth of va&s;t continents, are unable to pur&s;ue the great changes which happen in the atmo&s;phere: the confined horizon, which bounds our view, circum|&s;cribes al&s;o our ideas. The field of our ob&s;ervation is very limited; and a thou&s;and circum&s;tances com|bine to vary the effects of natural cau&s;es. There, on the contrary, an immen&s;e &s;cene opens before us; and the great agents of nature are collected in a &s;pace, which renders it ea&s;y to watch their various opera|tions. To the We&s;t, is the va&s;t liquid plain of the Mediterranean; to the Ea&s;t, the plain of the De&s;art, no le&s;s va&s;t, but ab&s;olutely dry; in the mid&s;t of the&s;e two level &s;urfaces, ri&s;e the mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits are &s;o many ob&s;ervatories, from whence the &s;ight may di&s;cern full thirty leagues. Four ob&s;ervers might command the whole extent of Syria; and, from the tops of Ca&s;iers, Lebanon and Tabor, let nothing e&s;cape them within that boundle&s;s horizon. They might ob&s;erve, how the region of the &s;ea, at fir&s;t un|clouded, veils it&s;elf with vapours; in what manner the&s;e vapours form into groups, and &s;eparate; and, by a con&s;tant mechani&s;m, a&s;cend and ri&s;e above the moun|tains;
<PB N="61" REF="64">
while, on the other hand, the de&s;art invariably clear, never produces clouds, and has only tho&s;e it has received from the &s;ea. They might reply to the que&s;tion propo&s;ed by M. <HI>Michaelis,</HI> to the traveller for the king of Denmark, "Whether the de&s;art pro|duces dews?" that the de&s;art, containing no water, except in winter, after the rains, can only furni&s;h va|pours at that period. On viewing the valley of Bal|beck, burnt up with heat, whil&s;t the head of Lebanon is hoary with ice and &s;now, they would be &s;en&s;ible of the truth of a maxim, which ought no longer to be di&s;puted, <HI>that the heat is greater in proportion as we ap|proach the &s;urface of the earth;</HI> &s;o that it &s;eems to pro|ceed only from the action of the rays of the &s;un upon the earth. In &s;hort, they might &s;ucce&s;sfully attempt the &s;olution of the greate&s;t part of meteorological problems.</P>
<P>The exaggerated, or in other terms, the grand ideas which hi&s;tory and travellers u&s;ually give to di&s;|tant objects, have accu&s;tomed us to &s;peak of the waters of Syria, with a re&s;pect, which amu&s;es our imagina|tion. We are fond of &s;aying, the <HI>river Jordan,</HI> the <HI>river Orontes,</HI> the <HI>river Adonis.</HI> If, however, we wi&s;h to pre&s;erve to words their proper &s;ignification, we &s;hall hardly find in this country, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> any other <HI>rivulets.</HI> The channels of the Orontes and the Jordan, the two mo&s;t con&s;iderable, are &s;carcely &s;ixty
<PB N="62" REF="65">
paces wide at their mouths; the others, do not merit to be mentioned. If the rains and melted &s;now give them &s;ome importance in the winter, their cour&s;e is only to be di&s;covered, during the remainder of the year, by the round &s;tones, and fragments of rocks with which their beds are filled. They are nothing but torrents and ca&s;cades; and it may be conceived, that from the proximity of the mountains, to the &s;ea, among which they ri&s;e, their waters have not time to collect in long valleys, &s;o as to form rivers.</P>
<P>The Jordan, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> may, in general, be about thirty-five cubits in breadth; but when the &s;now is thawed, or during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, its increa&s;e overflows its banks, extends to the di&s;tance of more than four miles, and is &s;ometimes divided into two or three channels.</P>
<P>It is &s;o rapid at all times, that the &s;tronge&s;t &s;wimmer cannot cro&s;s it; and it would be even dangerous to cro&s;s it in a boat, unle&s;s one had the mantling <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> mentioned in the &s;econd chapter of the &s;econd book of <HI>Kings.</HI> Its waters are always muddy; but when taken from the river, and put into any kind of ve&s;&s;el, they immediately clarify, leaving a black &s;ediment mixed with bituminous particles. The&s;e waters, how|ever are &s;weet, will not &s;oon corrupt, and abound with fi&s;h. Both &s;ides of the Jordan are bordered by a
<PB N="63" REF="66">
fore&s;t of tufted trees, which grow &s;o clo&s;ely in &s;ome places, that they are impenetrable to the rays of the &s;un. This fore&s;t is the retreat of tigers, which &s;ome|times carry de&s;olation to the &s;urrounding country. It is peopled al&s;o, with, birds of every kind, and particularly nightingales.</P>
<P>The&s;e waters are &s;aid to purify both the &s;oul and the body. The Greeks even imagine, that people are not properly baptized, until they have plunged three times into the river Jordan. Men, women, and chil|dren, therefore, may be &s;een throwing them&s;elves into the water together, with an eagerne&s;s almo&s;t border|ing on madne&s;s, without thinking that they offend both again&s;t mode&s;ty and decency.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of bathing in this river, is as ancient as the age of <HI>Eli&s;ha.</HI> "Go," &s;aid that prophet to <HI>Naaman,</HI> who was afflicted with the lepro&s;y, "wa&s;h in the Jordan &s;even times, and thy fle&s;h &s;hall come again unto thee, and thou &s;halt be clean." <HI>Naaman</HI> obeyed; and, as a reward for his faith, his blood was purified, and his fle&s;h became as &s;ound as that of an infant.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles oppo&s;ed by the mountains of the above-mentioned rivers, at the i&s;&s;ue, have formed con|&s;iderable lakes, in &s;everal places; &s;uch as tho&s;e of An|tioch,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, Houla, Tabaria, and that which is honoured with the name of the Dead Sea, or Lake A&s;phaltites. All the&s;e lakes, except the la&s;t, are of fre&s;h water, and contain &s;everal &s;pecies of fi&s;h, different from tho&s;e we are acquainted with.</P>
<P>Lake A&s;phaltites alone, contains neither animal nor vegetable life. We &s;ee no verdure on its banks, nor are fi&s;h to be found within its waters; but it is not true, that its exhalations are pe&s;tiferous, &s;o as to de|&s;troy birds flying over it. It is very common to &s;ee &s;wallows &s;kimming its &s;urface, and dipping for the water nece&s;&s;ary to build their ne&s;ts. The real cau&s;e which deprives it of vegetables and animals, is the ex|treme &s;altne&s;s of the water, which is infinitely &s;tronger than that of the &s;ea. The &s;oil around it, equally im|pregnated with this &s;alt, produces no plants; and the air it&s;elf, which becomes loaded with evaporation, and which receives al&s;o the &s;ulphureous and bituminous vapours, cannot be favourable to vegetation; hence, the deadly a&s;pect which reigns around this lake. In other re&s;pects, the ground about it is not mar&s;hy; and its waters are limpid and incorruptible, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with a di&s;&s;olution of &s;alt. The origin of this mineral, is ea&s;y to be di&s;covered; for on the South-we&s;t &s;hore, are mines of fo&s;&s;il &s;alt; which, for time immemorial, have &s;upplied the neighbouring Arabs, and even the city of Jeru&s;alem. We find al&s;o on
<PB N="65" REF="68">
this &s;hore, fragments of &s;ulphur and bitumen; as al&s;o hot fountains, and deep crevices; which are di&s;covered at a di&s;tance by little pyramids, built on the brink of them. At intervals, we al&s;o meet with un&s;hapen blocks, which prejudiced eyes mi&s;take for mutilated &s;tatues, and which pa&s;s with ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious pilgrims, for monuments, of the adventure of <HI>Lot</HI>'s <HI>wife,</HI> though it is no where &s;aid &s;he was metamor|pho&s;ed into &s;tone, like <HI>Niobe;</HI> but into &s;alt, which mu&s;t have melted the en&s;uing winter.</P>
<P>Some naturali&s;ts have been greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, to find a di&s;charge for the water, which the Jordan is continually pouring into the lake, and have, there|fore, been inclined to &s;u&s;pect it had a communication with the Mediterranean; but, be&s;ides that; we know of no gulf to corroborate this &s;uppo&s;ition; it has been demon&s;trated, by accurate calculations, that the eva|poration is more than &s;ufficient to carry off the waters brought by the river. It is, in fact, very con&s;ider|able, and frequently becomes &s;en&s;ible to the eye, by the fogs with which the lake is covered, at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, and which are afterwards di&s;per&s;ed by the heat.</P>
<P>A view of the country will convince us, that the mo&s;t elevated point of all Syria, is Lebanon, on the South-ea&s;t of Tripoli. Scarcely do we depart from
<PB N="66" REF="69">
Larnic, in Cyprus, which is thirty leagues di&s;tant, before we di&s;cover its &s;ummit, capped with clouds. This is al&s;o di&s;tinctly perceivable on the map, from the cour&s;e of the rivers. Next to Lebanon, the mo&s;t elevated part of the country, is Mount Akkar, which becomes vi&s;ible as &s;oon as we leave Marra, in the de&s;ert. It appears, like an enormous flattened cone, and is con&s;tantly in view for two days together.</P>
<P>Lebanon, which gives its name to the whole ex|ten&s;ive chain of the Ke&s;raouan, and the country of the Dru&s;es, pre&s;ents us every where with maje&s;tic mountains. At every &s;tep we meet with &s;cenes, in which nature di&s;plays either beauty or grandeur. When we land on the coa&s;t, the lo&s;tine&s;s and &s;teep a&s;cent of this mountainous ridge, which &s;eems to inclo&s;e the country, in&s;pires a&s;toni&s;hment and re&s;pect. Should the curious traveller climb the&s;e &s;ummits, which bound his view, the immen&s;ity of &s;pace which he di&s;covers becomes a fre&s;h &s;ubject of admiration; but, com|pletely to enjoy this maje&s;tic &s;cene, he mu&s;t a&s;cend the very point of Lebanon, or the Sannin. There, on every &s;ide, he will view an horizon without bounds; while, in clear weather, the fight is lo&s;t over the de|&s;ert, which extends to the Per&s;ian gulf, and over the &s;ea which bathes the coa&s;ts of Europe. He &s;eems to command the whole world, which the wandering eye, now &s;urveying the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive chain of mountains,
<PB N="67" REF="70">
tran&s;ports the imagination in an in&s;tant, from Antioch to Jeru&s;alem; and, now approaching the &s;urrounding objects, more minutely examines the rocks, woods, torrents, hill-&s;ides, villages, and towns: and the mind &s;ecretly exults at the diminution of things, which before appeared great. The &s;pectator contemplates the valley, ob&s;cured by &s;tormy clouds, with a novel delight, and &s;miles at hearing the thunder, which had &s;o often burnt over his head, growling under his feet; while the threatening &s;ummits of the mountains are dimini&s;hed, till they appear only like the furrows of a ploughed field, or the &s;teps of an amphitheatre; and the mind is flattered by an elevation above &s;o many great objects, on which pride makes it look down with a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>When the traveller vi&s;its the interior of the&s;e moun|tains, the ruggedne&s;s of the roads, the &s;teepne&s;s of the de&s;cents, the height of the precipices, &s;trike him at fir&s;t with terror; but the &s;agacity of his mule &s;oon relieves him, and he examines at his ea&s;e, tho&s;e pic|ture&s;que &s;cenes which &s;ucceed each other to enter|tain him. There, as in the Alps, he travels whole days, to reach a place which is in &s;ight at his depar|ture; he winds, he de&s;cends, he &s;kirts the hills, he climbs; and in this perpetual change of po&s;ition, it &s;eems as if &s;ome magic power varied for him at every &s;tep, the decorations of the &s;cenery. Sometimes he
<PB N="68" REF="71">
&s;ees villages ready to glide, from the rapid declivities on which they are built; and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the ter|races of one row of hou&s;es, &s;erve as a &s;treet to the row above them. I have reckoned, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> from a hundred, to a hundred and twenty of the&s;e grada|tions, on the &s;ame declivity, from the bottom of the valley to the top of the eminence.</P>
<P>The South of Syria, that is the hollow through which the Jordan flows, is a country of volcanos; the bituminous and &s;ulphureous &s;ources of the lake A&s;phaltites, the lava, the pumice &s;tones thrown upon its banks, and the hot bath of Tabaria, demon&s;trate, that this valley has been the &s;eat of a &s;ubterraneous fire, which is not yet extingui&s;hed. Clouds of &s;moke are often ob&s;erved to i&s;&s;ue from the lake, and new crevices to be formed upon its banks. If conjecture in &s;uch ca&s;es were not too liable to error, we might &s;u&s;pect that the whole valley has been formed only by a violent &s;inking of a country, which formerly poured the Jordan into the Mediterranean. It ap|pears certain, at lea&s;t, that the cata&s;trophe of five cities, de&s;troyed by fire, mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by the eruption of a volcano, then burning. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays, expre&s;sly, "that the tradition of the inhabitants of the country (that is of the Jews them&s;elves) was, that formerly the valley of the lake, had been peopled
<PB N="69" REF="72">
by thirteen flouri&s;hing cities, and that they were &s;wal|lowed up by a volcano."</P>
<P>This account &s;eems confirmed by the quantities of ruins, &s;till found by travellers, on the We&s;tern border. The&s;e eruptions have cea&s;ed long &s;ince; but earth|quakes, which u&s;ually &s;ucceed them, &s;till continue to be felt, at intervals, in this country. The coa&s;t, in general, is &s;ubject to them; and hi&s;tory gives us many examples of earthquakes, which have changed the face of Antioch, Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, &amp;c. In our time, in the year 1759, there happened one, which cau&s;ed the greate&s;t ravages. It is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed, in the valley of Balbeck, upwards of twenty thou&s;and per&s;ons; a lo&s;s which has never been repaired. It is remarked in Syria, that earthquakes &s;eldom happen but in winter, after the autumnal rains; and this ob&s;ervation, conformable to that made by Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> in Barbary, &s;eems to prove, that the action of water on the dried earth, has &s;ome &s;hare in the&s;e convul&s;ive motions.</P>
<P>The variety of productions which this province affords, is a&s;toni&s;hing. Be&s;ides wheat, rye, barley, beans, and the cotton plant, which is cultivated every where, we find a multitude of u&s;eful and agreeable productions, appropriated to different &s;ituations. Maize thrives in the light &s;oil of Balbeck; and even
<PB N="70" REF="73">
rice is cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s, in the low grounds. They have lately begun to plant &s;ugar-canes, in the gardens of Saide. Indigo grows without cultivating. The hill &s;ides of Latahia produce tobacco. As for trees, the olive-tree of Provence grows at Antioch, and at Ramla, to the height of the beech. The white mulberry tree con&s;titutes the wealth of the whole country of the Dru&s;es, by the beautiful &s;ilks which are produced on it; while the vine, &s;upported on poles, or winding round the oaks, &s;upplies grapes, which afford red and white wines, that might rival tho&s;e of Bourdeaux. Gaza produces dates, like Mecca, and pomegranates like Algiers; Tripoli affords oranges, equal to tho&s;e of Malta; Bairont, figs, like tho&s;e of Mar&s;eilles; and bananas, not inferior to tho&s;e of St. Domingo; Aleppo enjoys the exclu&s;ive advantage of producing pi&s;tachios; and Dama&s;cus ju&s;tly boa&s;ts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the fruits known in Europe. Twenty &s;orts of apricots are reckoned there; the &s;tone of one of which, contains a kernel highly valued through all Turkey. In &s;hort, the cochineal plant, which grows on all that coa&s;t, contains, perhaps, that precious in|&s;ect, in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St. Domingo. It was long imagined, that the cochineal was peculiar to Mexico; and the Spaniards, to &s;ecure the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, have prohibited the exportation of the living cochineal, under pain of death.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74">With the&s;e numerous advantages of climate and of &s;oil, it is not a&s;toni&s;hing, that Syria &s;hould always have been e&s;teemed a mo&s;t delicious country; and that the Greeks and Romans ranked it among the mo&s;t beau|tiful of their provinces, and even thought it not in|ferior to Egypt. In more moderate times, a Pacha, acquainted with both the&s;e provinces, being a&s;ked to which he gave the preference, replied, "Egypt, without doubt, is a mo&s;t beautiful farm, but Syria is a charming country hou&s;e."</P>
<P>To complete the natural hi&s;tory of Syria, it is pro|per to add, that it produces all dome&s;tic animals; and, be&s;ides the&s;e, the buffalo and the camel, who&s;e utility is &s;o well known. We al&s;o find antelopes in the plains, which &s;upply the place of our roebucks; and in the mountains are numbers of wild boars. The &s;tag and the deer are unknown there; the wolf, and the real fox, are very rare; but there is a pro|digious quantity of the middle &s;pecies, named jackall; which, in Syria, is called <HI>wauwee,</HI> in imitation of its howl. The&s;e jackalls go in droves, and frequent the environs of the towns, where they feed on what car|rion they can find. They never attack any one, but are always ready to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. Every evening they &s;eem to give each other the watch-word, and begin howling; and their cries, which are very
<PB N="72" REF="75">
doleful, la&s;t &s;ometimes for a quarter of an hour. In unfrequented places, there are al&s;o hyenas. But, in return, the country is exempt from lions and bears. Water-fowl are very plentiful; land game is not &s;o abundant. A &s;pecies of the humming-bird, &s;till exi&s;ts in the territory of Saide. This and the pelican, are the only remarkable birds in Syria.</P>
<P>Syria, as well as Egypt, Per&s;ia, and almo&s;t all the South of A&s;ia, is &s;ubject to another calamity, no le&s;s dreadful than the earthquakes; tho&s;e clouds of locu&s;ts &s;o often mentioned by travellers. The quantity of the&s;e in&s;ects is incredible, to all who have not wit|ne&s;&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hing numbers; the whole earth is covered with them, for the &s;pace of &s;everal leagues. The noi&s;e they make in browzing on the trees and herbage, may be heard at a great di&s;tance; and re|&s;embles that of an army foraging in &s;ecret. The Tartars them&s;elves, are a le&s;s de&s;tructive enemy than the&s;e little animals; one would imagine, that fire had followed their progre&s;s. Wherever the&s;e myriads &s;pread, the verdure of the country di&s;appears; and cau&s;es the dreary image of winter to &s;ucceed in an in|&s;tant, to the rich &s;cenery of &s;pring. When the&s;e clouds of locu&s;ts take their flight, to &s;urmount any ob|&s;tacle, or to traver&s;e more rapidly a defart &s;oil, the heavens, may literally be &s;aid, to be ob&s;cured by them.
<PB N="73" REF="76">
Happily this calamity is not frequently repeated; for it is the inevitable forerunner of famine, and the mal|adies it occa&s;ions. The inhabitants of Syria have remarked, that locu&s;ts are always bred by too mild winters; and that they con&s;tantly come from the de&s;ert of Arabia. From this ob&s;ervation, it is ea&s;y to con|ceive, that the cold not having been rigorous enough to de&s;troy their eggs, they multiply &s;uddenly; and, the herbage failing them in the immen&s;e plains of the de&s;ert, innumerable legions i&s;&s;ue forth. When they make their fir&s;t appearance on the cultivated country, the inhabitants &s;trive to drive them off, by rai&s;ing large clouds of &s;moke, but frequently their herbs and wet &s;traw fail them; they then dig trenches, where num|bers of them are buried; but the two mo&s;t efficacious de&s;troyers of the&s;e in&s;ects are, the South, and South-ea&s;terly winds, and the bird called the <HI>&s;amamar.</HI> The&s;e birds, which greatly re&s;emble the wood-pecker, follow them in numerous flocks, like &s;tarlings, and not only greedily devour them, but kill as many as they can; accordingly they are re&s;pected by the pea&s;ants, and no one is ever allowed to &s;hoot them. As for the Southerly and South-ea&s;terly winds, they drive with violence the&s;e clouds of locu&s;ts, over the Mediter|ranean, where &s;uch quantities of them are drowned, that, when their carca&s;es are thrown on the &s;hore, they infect the air for &s;everal days, even to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">In &s;o exten&s;ive a country as Syria, we may rea|&s;onably pre&s;ume the quality of the &s;oil is not every where the &s;ame. The land of the mountains is, in general, rude; and that of the plains, fat and loamy; and exhibiting every &s;ign of the greate&s;t fecundity. In the territory of Aleppo, towards Antioch, it re|&s;embles very fine brick-du&s;t, or Spani&s;h du&s;t. The waters of the Orontes, traver&s;ing this di&s;trict, are ting|ed with white, which proceeds from the nature of the lands towards its &s;ource. Almo&s;t every where el&s;e the earth is brown, and like fine garden mould. In the plains, it is often difficult to find a pebble.</P>
<P>Having now given an account of the climate, face of the country, and the productions of this province, we &s;hall proceed to treat of the different cities, and conclude with a general view of the inhabitants, who are divided into di&s;tinct nations, differing from each other in their cu&s;toms, manners, and religious cere|monies; and, in a great mea&s;ure, independent of the government of the Porte, though within the di&s;trict of Syria.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Pachalie of Aleppo. Divi&s;ion of the Country and Cities.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;ultan <HI>Selim</HI> I. had taken Smyrna from the Mamalukes, he &s;ubjected the province to the government of viceroys, or pachas, inve&s;ted with unlimited power. The more effectually to &s;ecure his authority, he divided the country into five govern|ments, or pachalies, which divi&s;ion &s;till remains. The&s;e pachalies, are tho&s;e of Aleppo, Tripoli, and Saide, lately removed to Acre; that of Dama&s;cus, and la&s;tly, that of Pale&s;tine, the &s;eat of which, is &s;ometimes at Gaza, and &s;ometimes at Jeru&s;alem. Since the time of <HI>Selim,</HI> the limits of the&s;e pachalies have often varied, but their general extent has been always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Following this divi&s;ion of the country, we &s;hall proceed to give a de&s;cription of the mo&s;t remarkable places in each pachalie. We will begin with the mo&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="79">
Northerly, that of Aleppo. This pachalie extends from the Euphrates, to the Mediterranean, between two lines, one drawn from Scandaroon to Beer; the other from the Beles to the &s;ea, by Mara, and the bridge of Shoger. This &s;pace principally con&s;i&s;ts of two plains, that of Antioch to the We&s;t, and that of Aleppo to the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The places which merit mo&s;t attention in this pa|chalie are, fir&s;t, the city of Aleppo, called by the Arabs <HI>Halab,</HI> and, by ancient geographers Chalybon. This city is the capital of the government, and the or|dinary re&s;idence of the pacha. It is &s;ituated in the va&s;t plain extending from the Orontes to the Euphra|tes; and which, towards the South, terminates in the de&s;art. The &s;ituation of Aleppo, be&s;ides the advan|tage of a rich and fruitful &s;oil, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es al&s;o that of a &s;tream of fre&s;h water, which never becomes dry. This river, which is about as large as that of the new river near London, terminates &s;ix leagues below Aleppo, in a morafs, &s;ull of wild boars and pelicans. Near Aleppo, its banks are covered with a fertile earth, and laid out in gardens, or rather orchards; which, in a hot country, and e&s;pecially in Turkey, cannot but be delightful. The city is in it&s;elf, one of the mo&s;t agreeable in Syria; and is, perhaps, the clean|e&s;t and be&s;t built of any in Turkey. On whatever &s;ide it is approached, its numerous minarets and
<PB N="77" REF="80">
domes, pre&s;ent an agreeable pro&s;pect to the eye, fa|tigued with the continued &s;amene&s;s of the brown and parched plains. In the centre is an artificial foun|tain, &s;urrounded by a dry ditch, on which is a ruinous fortre&s;s. From hence we have a fine pro&s;pect of the whole city; and to the North, di&s;cover the &s;nowy tops of the mountains of Bailan; and on the We&s;t, tho&s;e which &s;eparate the Orontes from the &s;ea; while to the South and Ea&s;t, the eye can di&s;cern as far as the Euphrates. In the time of <HI>Omar,</HI> this ca&s;tle &s;topped the progre&s;s of the Arabs, for &s;everal months, and was at la&s;t taken by treachery; but, at pre&s;ent, would not be able to re&s;i&s;t the feeble&s;t a&s;&s;ault. Its &s;light walls, low and without a buttre&s;s, are in ruins; its little old towers, are in no better condition; and it has not four cannon fit for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Aleppo, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> celebrated for the number of its inhabitants, the beauty of its edifices, the extent of its commerce, and the riches which that produce, is &s;ituated in a hollow valley, clo&s;e to a &s;mall river. This water, which &s;upplies the inhabitants of Aleppo, appears as extraordinary in the country through which it runs, as the city it&s;elf, in the de&s;art in which it &s;tands.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es, which are all built with terraces on their tops, are &s;o equal in height, that there are &s;el|dom
<PB N="78" REF="81">
any &s;teps to a&s;cend, in going from one hou&s;e to another; while &s;everal large vaulted &s;treets increa&s;e the facility of communication, by affording a pa&s;&s;age to every part of the city, free from the embarra&s;&s;ment of open &s;treets. They are carefully paved, have gutters, and a foot pavement on each &s;ide, and the middle of the &s;treet is laid with brick, the &s;mall end upwards, for the convenience of the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>In this city we find a cleanline&s;s, unknown to other cities in Turkey, even to the capital it&s;elf. This re|gulation is not attended with the &s;ame trouble as in Europe; there are a&s;s-drivers, who go about the city and take up the rubbi&s;h and dirt, which every inha|bitant is obliged to &s;weep together.</P>
<P>Though Aleppo cannot be e&s;teemed a place of im|portance in war, as a commercial city it has a diffe|rent appearance. It is the emporium of Armenia, and the Diarbekar; &s;ends caravans to Bagdad, and into Per&s;ia; and communicates with the Per&s;ian gulf and India, by Ba&s;&s;ora; with Egypt and Mecca, by Dama&s;cus; and with Europe, by Scandaroon (Alex|andretta) and Latahia. The chief commodities are, raw or &s;pun cottons, coar&s;e cloths, goats hair, gall and pi&s;tachio nuts, and &s;hawls; the wool of which, is &s;o fine and &s;ilky, that the whole handkerchief may be contained in the two hands clo&s;ed. The mo&s;t beautiful
<PB N="79" REF="82">
comes from Ca&s;hmire; their value is from &s;ix guineas to fifty pounds.</P>
<P>The French have a con&s;ul in this city, and &s;even counting-hou&s;es; the Engli&s;h and the Venetian two; and the merchants of Leghorn one. The late em|peror <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> appointed one in 1784, in the per&s;on of a rich Jew, who &s;haved his beard to a&s;&s;ume the uniform and the &s;word.</P>
<P>This city is not exceeded in extent, by any in Turkey, except Con&s;tantinople and Cairo, and per|haps Smyrna. The number of inhabitants has been computed at two hundred thou&s;and. The people of Aleppo, are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t civilized in all Turkey; and the European merchants no where en|joy &s;o much liberty, or are treated with &s;o much re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The air of Aleppo is very dry and piercing; but, at the &s;ame time, very &s;alubrious, for all who are not troubled with a&s;thmatic complaints. The city, how|ever, and the environs, are &s;ubject to a &s;ingular en|demial di&s;order, which is called the ring-worm, or pimple of Aleppo; it is, in fact, a pimple, which is at fir&s;t inflammatory, and at length becomes an ulcer of the &s;ize of the nail. The u&s;ual duration of this ulcer is one year, it commonly fixes on the face, and
<PB N="80" REF="83">
leaves a &s;car, which disfigures almo&s;t all the inhabi|tants. It is alledged, that every &s;tranger who re&s;ides there three months, is attacked with it; experience has taught, that the be&s;t mode of treatment is to u&s;e no remedy. No rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned for this malady; but it is &s;u&s;pected to proceed from the quality of the water, as it is likewi&s;e frequent in the neighbouring villages, in &s;ome parts of the Diarbekar; and even in certain di&s;tricts near Dama&s;cus, where the &s;oil and the water have the &s;ame appearances.</P>
<P>For a long time, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> this di&s;ea&s;e was at|tributed to the &s;ubtility of the air of Aleppo; but tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have never drank water till it has been boiled, remaining free from this di&s;temper, makes it rather &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the water. There have been per&s;ons, who &s;taid in this city only a few days, who have been attacked by this di&s;ea&s;e even a year after. The method of cure is very &s;im|ple; nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to lay an ivy leaf, with a little cerate &s;pread upon it, over the tu|mour, and this brings it to a &s;uppuration in the cour&s;e of a year. No particular regimen is required; and, when a cure is effected, the body generally enjoys good health for a long while after.</P>
<P>Every one has heard of the pigeons of Aleppo, which &s;erve as couriers at Alexandretta and Bagdad.
<PB N="81" REF="84">
This u&s;e of them, which is not fabulous, has been laid a&s;ide for the la&s;t thirty of forty years, becau&s;e the curd robbers killed the pigeons. The manner of &s;ending advice by them was this: they took pairs, which had young ones, and carried them on hor&s;eback to the place from whence they wi&s;hed them to return, taking care to let them have a full view. When the news arrived, the corre&s;pondent tied a billet to the pigeon's foot, and let her loo&s;e. The bird, impatient to &s;ee its young, flew off like lightning, and arrived at Aleppo in ten hours from Alexandretta, and in two days from Bagdad. This pigeon has nothing peculiar in its form, except its no&s;trils, which, in&s;tead of being &s;mooth and even, are &s;welled and rough.</P>
<P>The open &s;ituation of Aleppo, brings a great number of &s;ea-birds there, and affords the curious a &s;ingular amu&s;ement: if a per&s;on goes after dinner, on the terrace of the hou&s;es, and makes a motion as if throwing bread, numerous flocks of birds will in&s;tantly fly round him, though at fir&s;t he cannot di&s;cover one; but they are floating aloft in the air, and de&s;cend in a moment to &s;eize in their flight, the mor&s;els of bread, which the inhabitants frequently amu&s;e them&s;elves with throwing them.</P>
<P>Next to Aleppo, Antioch, called by the Arabs An|tahia, claims our attention. This city, anciently re|nowned
<PB N="82" REF="85">
for the luxury of its inhabitants, is now no more than a ruinous town; who&s;e hou&s;es, built with mud and &s;traw, and narrow and miry &s;treets, exhibit every appearance of mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s. The&s;e hou&s;es are &s;ituated on the Southern bank of the Oron|tes, at the extremity of an old decayed bridge: they are covered to the South by a mountain, upon the &s;lope of which is wall, built by the Cru&s;aders.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the unpoli&s;hed manners of its in|habitants, Antioch was better calculated than Aleppo, to be the emporium of the Europeans. By clearing the mouth of the Orontes, which is &s;ix leagues lower down, boats might have been towed up that river; though, according to <HI>Volney,</HI> they could not have &s;ailed up, as <HI>Pococke</HI> affirms; the current being extremely rapid. We no longer hear at Antioch, either of the grove of <HI>Daphne,</HI> or of the voluptuous &s;cenes, of which it was the theatre. The plain of Antioch, though the &s;oil of it is excellent, is uncultivated and abandoned to the Turcomen; but the hills on the &s;ide of the Orontes, abound in plantations of figs and olives, vines and mulberry-trees, which are planted in quin|cunx, and exhibit a land&s;cape worthy our fine&s;t pro|vinces.</P>
<P>The gulf towards the North-ea&s;t, is remarkable for nothing, but the town of Alexandretta, or Scanda|roon,
<PB N="83" REF="86">
of which it bears the name. This town, &s;ituated on the &s;ea-&s;hore, is, properly &s;peaking, nothing but a village without walls; in which, the tombs are more numerous than the hou&s;es, and entirely owing its ex|i&s;tence to the road it commands. This is the only road in all Syria, where ve&s;&s;els anchor on a &s;olid bot|tom, without their cables being liable to chafe; but, in other re&s;pects, it has &s;o many &s;erious inconvenien|ces, that nece&s;&s;ity alone prevents the merchants from abandoning it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is infe&s;ted during winter, by a wind pecu|liar to this place, which, ru&s;hing from the &s;nowy &s;um|mits of the mountains, frequently forces &s;hips to drag their anchors &s;everal leagues. Secondly, when the &s;now begins to cover the mountains, which &s;urround the gulf, tempe&s;tuous winds ari&s;e, which prevent ve&s;|&s;els from entering it, for three or four months. Thirdly, the road from Alexandretta to Aleppo, by the plain, is infe&s;ted by curd robbers, who conceal them&s;elves in the neighbouring rocks, and frequently attack and plunder the &s;tronge&s;t caravans. Another rea&s;on more forcible than all the&s;e is, the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the air of Alexandretta. It may be affirmed, that it every year carries off one-third of the crews of ve&s;&s;els, which remain there during the &s;ummer; nay, &s;hips frequently lo&s;e all their men in a couple of months. The &s;ea&s;on for this epidemic di&s;order, is
<PB N="84" REF="87">
principally from May, to the end of September; it is an intermittent fever of the mo&s;t malignant kind, and accompanied with ob&s;tructions of the liver, which terminate in a drop&s;y. The cities of Tripoli, Acre, and Larneca, in Cyprus, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;|order, though in a le&s;s degree. In all the&s;e places, the &s;ame local circum&s;tances &s;eem to have given birth to the contagion; the cau&s;e of it is to be a&s;cribed to the adjoining mora&s;&s;es, and &s;tanding waters; which, in con&s;equence, produce vapours, and mephitic exha|lations; a convincing proof of this is, that the di&s;|order does not prevail in &s;ea&s;ons, when no rain has fallen. But, unfortunately, Alexandretta is con|demned, from its &s;ituation, never to be wholly exempt from it; for the plain on which the town is built, is &s;o low and flat, that the rivulets finding no declivity, can never reach the &s;ea. This plain is about a league in breadth, and lies at the foot of the moun|tains, and has been formed from earth brought down by the torrents. When they are &s;welled by the win|ter rains, the &s;ea, &s;welled likewi&s;e by tempe&s;ts, hinders their di&s;charging them&s;elves into it; hence, the&s;e waters, forced to &s;pread them&s;elves, form lakes in the plain. On the approach of &s;ummer, the waters be|come corrupted by the heat, and exhale vapours equally corrupt, which cannot di&s;per&s;e, being con|fined by the mountains that encircle the gulf. The entrance of the bay, be&s;ides, lies to the We&s;t, which,
<PB N="85" REF="88">
in tho&s;e countries is the mo&s;t unhealthy expo&s;ure, when it corre&s;ponds with the &s;ea. The labour nece&s;|&s;ary to remedy this, would be immen&s;e; and, under a government like that of the Turks, impo&s;&s;ible. A few years ago, the merchants of Aleppo, di&s;gu&s;ted with the numerous inconveniences of Alexandretta, wi&s;hed to abandon that po&s;t, and carry the trade to Latakia. They propo&s;ed to the pacha of Tripoli, to repair the harbour at their own expence, provided he would grant them an exemption of all duties for ten years. To induce him to comply with their reque&s;t, the agent they employed, talked much of the advan|tage which would, <HI>in time,</HI> re&s;ult to the whole country. "But what &s;ignifies to me what may happen in time, replied the pacha? I was ye&s;terday at Marach, to|morrow, perhaps, I &s;hall be at Djedda; why &s;hould I deprive my&s;elf of pre&s;ent advantages, which are cer|tain, for future benefits I cannot hope to partake?" The European factors were obliged, therefore, to re|main at Scandaroon. There are three of the&s;e fac|tors; two for the French, and one for the Engli&s;h and Venetians. The only curio&s;ity which they have to amu&s;e &s;trangers with, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ix or &s;even marble monuments, &s;ent from England, on which are writ|ten, <HI>Here lies &s;uch a one, carried off in the flower of his age, by the fatal effects of a contagious air.</HI> The fight of the&s;e is the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as the languid air, yellow complexion, livid eyes, and drop&s;ical bellies
<PB N="86" REF="89">
of tho&s;e who &s;hew them, make it but too probable, they cannot long e&s;cape the &s;ame fate. It is true, they have &s;ome re&s;ource in the village of Bailen; the pure air, and excellent waters of which, &s;urpri&s;ingly re&s;tore the &s;ick. This village, &s;ituated among the mountains, three leagues from Alexandretta, pre&s;ents the mo&s;t picture&s;que appearance. It is built among precipices, in a narrow and deep valley, from whence the gulf of Scandaroon is &s;een, as through a tube. The hou&s;es, leaning again&s;t the &s;teep declivities of the two mountains, are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the terraces of the lower &s;erve as &s;treets and courts to tho&s;e above. In winter, ca&s;cades pour down on every &s;ide, which &s;tun the inhabitants with their noi&s;e; and, in their fall, &s;ometimes rend off large pieces of the rocks, and even throw down the hou&s;es. The cold is very &s;evere there, during that &s;ea&s;on, but the &s;ummer delightful; the inhabitants, who &s;peak only Turki&s;h, live on their goats and buffaloes, and the produce of a few gardens which they cultivate.</P>
<P>On the road from Alexandretta to Aleppo, is the village of Martawan, celebrated among the Turks and Europeans, on account of an extraordinary prac|tice of the inhabitants, who let out their wives and daughters for a trifling &s;um. This pro&s;titution, held in abhorrence by the Arabs, &s;eems to have originated in &s;ome religious cu&s;tom, which ought, perhaps, to be
<PB N="87" REF="90">
&s;ought for in the ancient wor&s;hip of the godde&s;s <HI>Venus,</HI> or be attributed to the community of women, permitted by the An&s;arians, to which tribe the inha|bitants of Mortawan belong. The Franks pretend that the women are pretty. But it is probable, that long ab&s;tinence at &s;ea, and the variety of intrigue, con&s;titute all their merit; for their exterior announ|ces nothing but the di&s;gu&s;ting uncleanline&s;s of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Two days journey to the North-ea&s;t of Aleppo, is the town of Mambedj; &s;o celebrated in ancient times, under the names of Bambyce, and Hierapolis. No traces remain of the temple of that great godde&s;s, with who&s;e wor&s;hip <HI>Lucian</HI> has made us acquainted. The only remarkable monument is a &s;ubterraneous canal, which conducts the water from the mountains of the North, to the di&s;tance of four leagues. All this country, was formerly full of &s;uch aqueducts: the A&s;&s;yrians, Medes, and Per&s;ians, e&s;teemed it a re|ligious duty to convey the water to the de&s;art, in order to multiply, according to the precepts of <HI>Zoroa&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>principles of life and abundance:</HI> we, therefore, at every &s;tep, meet with a&s;toni&s;hing proofs of ancient population. Along the whole road from Aleppo to Hama, may be &s;een the ruins of ancient villages, ci&s;terns fallen in, and the remains of for|tre&s;&s;es; nay, even of temples.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Pachalie of Tripoli.</HEAD>
<P>THE pachalie of Tripoli, comprehends the country, which &s;tretches along the Mediter|ranean, from Latahia to the Nark-el-Kelb, and is bounded on the We&s;t by that torrent, and the chain of mountains which overlook the Orontes. The principal part of this government is hilly; the &s;ea-coa&s;t alone, between Tripoli and Latahia, is a level country. This pachalie, contains &s;everal different tribes and religions. Among its remarkable cities, we mu&s;t fir&s;t mention Tripoli. It is &s;ituated on the river Kadi&s;ha, at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league from its mouth, and preci&s;ely at the foot of Lebanon, which overlooks and &s;urrounds it with its branches, to the Ea&s;t, the South, and even a little to the North-we&s;t. It is &s;eparated from the &s;ea, by a &s;mall trian|gular plain, called <HI>La Marine,</HI> half a league in breadth; at the point of which is the village where the ve&s;&s;els land their goods.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">All the environs of Tripoli, are laid out in or|chards, where the nopal grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and the white mulberry is cultivated for the &s;ilk-worm; and, the pomegranate, the orange, and the lemon-tree, for their fruit; which is of the greate&s;t beauty. But the&s;e places, though delightful to the eye, are un|healthy. Every year, from July to September, epi|demic fevers, like tho&s;e of Scandaroon and Cyprus, rage here: the&s;e are owing to the artificial inunda|tions, with which the mulberry-trees are watered, in order that they may throw out their &s;econd leaves. Be&s;ides, as the city is open only to the We&s;t, the air does not circulate, and the &s;pirits are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion, which makes health at be&s;t but a kind of convale&s;cence. The air, though more humid, is more &s;alubrious at <HI>La Marine,</HI> doubtle&s;s from its having greater freedom of circulation. It is worthy of ob&s;ervation al&s;o, that the Southern &s;hore of this plain, is full of the ruins of habitations, and columns broken and buried in the earth, or in the &s;ea &s;ands. The Franks have employed a great number of them, in the building of their walls; in the remains of which, they are &s;till to be &s;een laid cro&s;s-ways.</P>
<P>The commerce of Tripoli, con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t wholly in indifferent coar&s;e &s;ilks, which are made u&s;e of for laces. It is ob&s;erved, they are every day lo&s;ing their quality. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, the decay of the mul|berry-trees;
<PB N="90" REF="93">
of which, &s;carcely any thing now re|mains but &s;ome hollow trunks. A &s;tranger in&s;tantly a&s;ks, why not plant new ones? This is an European ob&s;ervation. Here they never plant; becau&s;e, were they to build or plant, the pacha would &s;ay, this man has money. He would &s;end for him, and de|mand it of him: &s;hould he &s;ay he had none, he would receive the ba&s;tinado; &s;hould he confe&s;s, he would &s;till receive it, in order to extort from him the ac|knowledgment that he had more. This commerce is in the hands of the French alone. They have a con|&s;ul here, and three commercial hou&s;es. Their exports are &s;ilk and &s;punges, fi&s;hed up in the road; the&s;e they exchange for cloths, cochineal, &s;ugar, and We&s;t-India coffee; but this factory, both with re&s;pect to imports and exports, is inferior to its &s;ubordinate town Latakia.</P>
<P>The town of Latahia, founded by <HI>Seleucus Nicator,</HI> under the name of Laodicea, is &s;ituated at the ba&s;e, and on the Southern &s;ide of a &s;mall penin&s;ula, which projects half a league into the &s;ea. Its port is a &s;ort of ba&s;on, environed by a mole, the entrance of which is very narrow. It might contain five and twenty, or thirty ve&s;&s;els; but the Turks have &s;uffered it &s;o to be choaked up, as &s;carcely to admit four. Notwith|&s;tanding this, Latahia carries on a very great com|merce, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in tobacco; of which, up|wards
<PB N="91" REF="94">
of twenty cargoes are annually &s;ent to Da|mietta. In the time of <HI>Strabo,</HI> the exports con&s;i&s;ted in its famous wines, the produce of the hill &s;ides. Even then, Egypt was the market by the way of Alexandria. Neither Latahia, nor Tripoli, can be mentioned as places of &s;trength. They have neither cannon nor &s;oldiers; a &s;ingle privateer would make a conque&s;t of them both. They are each &s;uppo&s;ed to contain from four, to five thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;ts between the&s;e towns, we meet with &s;everal inhabited villages, which were formerly large cities; but we find &s;till more places, which have only the half de&s;troyed, remains of ancient habitations. Among the latter, is the rock or i&s;land of Roud, for|merly a powerful city and republic, known by the name of <HI>Aradus.</HI> Not a &s;ingle wall is remaining of all that multitude of hou&s;es; which, according to <HI>Strabo,</HI> were built with more &s;tories than even tho&s;e of Rome. The liberty enjoyed by the inhabitants, had rendered it very popular, and it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by naval commerce, manufactures, and arts. At pre&s;ent, the i&s;land is de&s;erted; nor has tradition even retained the memory of a &s;pring of fre&s;h water in its environs, which the people of Aradus di&s;covered at the bottom of the &s;ea, and from which they drew water, in time of war, by means of a leaden bell, and a leathern pipe fitted to its bottom. The river Ibrahim, the ancient
<PB N="92" REF="95">
<HI>Adonis,</HI> which is two leagues to the Southward, has the only bridge to be &s;een, that of Tripoli excepted, from thence to Antioch. It is of a &s;ingle arch, fifty feet wide, and upwards of thirty high, of a very light architecture, and appears to have been a work of the Arabs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Pachalie of Acre.</HEAD>
<P>TO the South of the pachalie of Tripoli, and on the &s;ame coa&s;t, is a third pachalie; that, till now, has borne the name of the city of Saide, its capital; but may henceforward a&s;&s;ume that of Acre, to which place the pacha has of late years transferred his re|&s;idence. This city, which is now the principal one in the pachalie, is &s;ituated in a large plain, bounded on the South by Mount Carmel; on the We&s;t, by the mountains of Galilee: and on the North, by another mountain, called the ladder of Tyre: &s;uch is the de|&s;cription
<PB N="93" REF="96">
given of it by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> It was formerly reckoned among the ancient cities of Phenicia. The addition of St. <HI>John,</HI> &s;eems to have been given it, on account of the ho&s;pital knights of that order, who took refuge there after the ruin of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Nothing is now to be &s;een of this ancient city, but the &s;hapele&s;s remains of monuments erected in it by the Chri&s;tians. In the We&s;tern part, are found &s;ome ruins of a church, dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew.</HI> Three large windows, which time has not yet de&s;troyed, give us a very grand idea of this building.</P>
<P>The palace of the grand ma&s;ter of the order of St. <HI>John</HI> of Jeru&s;alem, with the whole extent of the ho&s;pital, &s;erve at pre&s;ent for a habitation to the chief of Acre, together with his family and part of his ca|valry.</P>
<P>This edifice, which is almo&s;t entire, owes its pre|&s;ervation to the a&s;toni&s;hing thickne&s;s of its walls. It is particularly remarkable for two high towers, and its &s;ubterranean apartments; which contained hand-mills that are &s;till &s;ometimes u&s;ed.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e towers, is an immen&s;e hall; in the centre of which, there is a large fountain, ornamented with marble of every kind.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">Oppo&s;ite to the palace of the pacha, is a large &s;quare; in the Northern part of which, ari&s;e the ruins of the church and mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Clara.</HI> It was in this memorable a&s;ylum, that &s;ome virtuous virgins mutilated their vi&s;ages, when the city was &s;acked and taken by the Saracens, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the brutality of the&s;e barbarians; who, finding them ob|jects of horror, butchered them without mercy.</P>
<P>There are here two Latin churches, in one of which public wor&s;hip is performed by the fathers of the Holy Land, who inhabit a very commodious ho&s;|pital, which &s;tands clo&s;e to it, and which is open at all times to travellers and devotees, who are pious enough to go and vi&s;it the tombs in Galilee.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Acre are all &s;o narrow, that when a camel goes along the broade&s;t of them, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any other animal to pa&s;s at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Cut &s;tones only, and not bricks, are employed for con&s;tructing the hou&s;es. The roofs, very different from ours, are made flat, in the form of a terrace, upon which the inhabitants walk; and which brings to re|membrance tho&s;e mentioned by <HI>Vitruvius.</HI> The con|&s;truction is &s;ingular. When the walls of an edifice are fini&s;hed, and the upper &s;tory is covered with beams of greater or le&s;s &s;trength, cypre&s;s boards are
<PB N="95" REF="98">
then laid clo&s;ely one again&s;t another, and nailed down to them. This covering &s;upports, in its turn, &s;everal joi&s;ts, placed tran&s;ver&s;ely; over which are &s;pread hay and chopped &s;traw, mixed with lime and &s;mall &s;tones. The whole being made &s;mooth by means of a mallet, a layer of cinder is then thrown over this compo|&s;ition; afterwards a &s;econd of lime and &s;and; and la&s;tly, a third, con&s;i&s;ting of a kind of plai&s;ter, formed of lime, a&s;hes, and pounded cinders, which is &s;moothed with a roller, and to which a lu&s;tre and poli&s;h are given, by a certain kind of wooden in&s;trument. This is the u&s;ual method of con&s;tructing the&s;e terraces.</P>
<P>If this floor happens to crack by the exce&s;&s;ive heat, the fi&s;&s;ures are filled up with a mixture of lime, a&s;hes and oil; and this compo&s;ition will re&s;i&s;t the longe&s;t rains, and at length become &s;o hard, that water cannot penetrate it. Roofs built in the form of a cupola, are covered or encru&s;ted with a &s;ub|&s;tance, con&s;i&s;ting of pounded flints and lime, which is applied with great care, in order that it may acquire a lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>In this city are two Bazars, or markets, always well &s;upplied. One contains provi&s;ions of every kind; and the other is furni&s;hed with an a&s;&s;ortment of cloths and &s;tuffs for making dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="99">In the &s;ame &s;pot, are al&s;o two public baths, orna|mented with marble, and pretty well con&s;tructed: there are here, likewi&s;e, &s;everal coffee-hou&s;es, which give this place a lively and agreeable appearance.</P>
<P>The air of this city is unwhole&s;ome; and various di&s;ea&s;es prevail in it every year during the great heats. The&s;e, no doubt, are occa&s;ioned by the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, and &s;ome putrid mar&s;hes in the neigh|bourhood. The be&s;t precaution that Europeans can take, again&s;t the malignity of this air, is to confine them&s;elves to a moderate diet; and above all, to avoid night dews, and not to ri&s;e till the &s;un has di&s;&s;i|pated that collection of clouds and vapours, with which the atmo&s;phere is loaded every morning.</P>
<P>This city was rai&s;ed to its pre&s;ent con&s;equence, by a very extraordinary character, <HI>Shaik Daher,</HI> who for many years u&s;urped the government of it; con|&s;enting, for form's &s;ake, to be annually inve&s;ted with it, by a ba&s;haw from the Porte; but, in other re&s;pects, paid no regard to their authority. He governed his people with great ju&s;tice, and &s;hewed an extraordinary partiality to the Chri&s;tians; by which means, he drew a con&s;iderable number of them to &s;ettle in his terri|tories, where they were &s;ecure from tho&s;e extortions practi&s;ed on them by the neighbouring pachas. By the following act of ju&s;tice and humanity, &s;hewn to
<PB N="97" REF="100">
&s;ome pilgrims who were &s;hipwrecked on his coa&s;t, he acquired the confidence of &s;ucceeding ones, that they preferred landing at Acre, where they paid the cu&s;|tomary dues of landing, to Yafa, which was before the port where all pilgrims landed, in their pa&s;&s;age from Europe to the Holy Land. Two ve&s;&s;els filled with Greeks, French, and Armenians, to the number of two hundred, were in their pa&s;&s;age from Europe to Yafa, driven on &s;hore by a dreadful &s;torm in the gulf of Acre. Though they had the good fortune to e&s;cape the fury of the waves, they found them&s;elves in a dangerous and di&s;agreeable &s;ituation on &s;hore. Some of the neighbouring pea&s;ants, a mercile&s;s and thieving race, called Gorans, attacked them, and &s;trip|ped them of their clothes, and every thing they had &s;aved from the wreck. The captains of the &s;hips were no more re&s;pected than the re&s;t of the com|pany; twelve of whom only having found means to e&s;cape, arrived at Acra, during the time it was rava|ged by the plague.</P>
<P>The governor informed of this ma&s;&s;acre, di&s;patched in great ha&s;te a party of &s;oldiers, who found nothing on the &s;hore but &s;ome mangled bodies. Their orders were, to take all the Gorans without di&s;tinction, whe|ther guilty or innocent. Such of the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins as they could find, were hung; and when the vengeance of the princes were once &s;atisfied, his compa&s;&s;ion took
<PB N="98" REF="101">
plea&s;ure in comforting the unhappy travellers, whom he furni&s;hed with lodging, food, and cloathing. Fate, however, had not yet done per&s;ecuting them; for they were attacked by the plague which &s;pared only eight of them. Deeply affected by this new misfor|tune, and, in order to &s;ecure them from every acci|dent, the chief ordered twenty men to e&s;cort them on hor&s;eback, to Jeru&s;alem; and gave them, from his trea&s;ury, a &s;um &s;ufficient to maintain them for a con|&s;iderable time. This was a noble and generous ac|tion, which gained him the e&s;teem and affection of his &s;ubjects. He found al&s;o another recompence, in the profit he afterwards gained from the Armenians; for that nation, deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the kindne&s;s &s;hewn by the governor of Acre, to their eight citi|zens, when any of the inhabitants came on a pilgri|mage to Jeru&s;alem, they &s;topped at Acre, in prefe|rence to Yafa, to pay there the duty of landing. They did the &s;ame on their return; and the greate&s;t part of the&s;e pilgrims being rich merchants, increa&s;ed the commerce of the city, by purcha&s;ing and &s;elling the various kinds of merchandize.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Daher Omar</HI> &s;aw him&s;elf fixed in the go|vernment, like an intelligent man well acquainted with the true &s;ource of opulence, he endeavoured by every method he could, to introduce commerce into it. The polite and affable manner he behaved to|wards
<PB N="99" REF="102">
the European merchants, added to the &s;trict ju&s;tice which he maintained in traffic, drew thither people from all parts of the world; and the Engli&s;h, the French, and the Dutch, all wi&s;hed to partake in the advantages which the city of Acre held forth, by the abundance of its productions, particularly its cotton.</P>
<P><HI>Daher</HI> readily fore&s;aw, that the number of Euro|pean merchants would increa&s;e, in proportion to the facility which they might find in vending the merchan|dize they brought along with them. On this account, he dimini&s;hed the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e dues, and rendered his country as advantageous as convenient for the Turki&s;h and Arabian merchants, of the city of Da|ma&s;cus; who u&s;ed before to &s;upply them&s;elves with goods at the market of Seyd. The&s;e, almo&s;t imme|diately, began to come to Acre, in numerous cara|vans, which made trade decrea&s;e in the neighbouring cities; and opened to Europe, an ea&s;y communication for exporting all &s;orts of merchandize, &s;uch as drugs, and cloth of every kind, which are furni&s;hed in great abundance, by the va&s;t commerce of Dama&s;cus. In &s;hort, the trade of the city of Acre, ro&s;e to &s;o much importance and con&s;ideration, that &s;everal princes of Europe, &s;ent thither con&s;uls, to protect and &s;upport &s;uch of their &s;ubjects, as had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves here as merchants.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103">The French had a vice-con&s;ul here for a con&s;ider|able time; but, on account of &s;ome di&s;putes with the merchants, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to recall him, and the duties of con&s;ul are now di&s;charged by the mer|chants them&s;elves, in rotation.</P>
<P>England al&s;o has a vice-con&s;ul here, who belongs to the con&s;ul&s;hip of Aleppo. By letters patent from the Imperial internuncio, at Con&s;tantinople, and the Venetian con&s;ul, re&s;ident at Cyprus, he is commi&s;|&s;ioned to protect at Acre, the merchants belonging to both the&s;e nations. He watches al&s;o, over the in|tere&s;ts of Ragu&s;a, for the con&s;ul at Cyprus.</P>
<P>All affairs re&s;pecting the Dutch trade, are mana|ged by a particular con&s;ul, dependant like the Eng|li&s;h vice-con&s;ul, on the con&s;ul-general of Aleppo.</P>
<P>The expence of freight for merchandize, exported from Acre to Europe, is regulated by the u&s;ual rate at Cyprus; and this is followed through all the re&s;t of Syria.</P>
<P>Near the &s;ea-&s;hore, about two hundred and fifty paces from the city, is the river Belus; "the bed of which is confined and narrow, and contains abundance of gla&s;s particles mixed with its &s;and." <HI>Pliny,</HI> who gives us this information, &s;hews how that tran&s;parent
<PB N="101" REF="104">
matter was indebted for its origin to the oriental &s;hores. This valuable di&s;covery being carried to perfection, rai&s;ed man to the heavens; brought to his eye remote objects, the immen&s;e di&s;tances of which he can calculate and mea&s;ure; &s;ubmitted to his in|&s;pection, the planets and cele&s;tial bodies; and per|mitted him, like the eagle, to approach the burning rays of light, which he can divide and re-unite at plea&s;ure. It &s;ecures him al&s;o from the injuries of the air, when, from the center of his habitation, he can behold, through its tran&s;parent pores, the &s;plendor of day in its full glory.</P>
<P>The river Belus, al&s;o is celebrated by the hi&s;torian <HI>Flavian,</HI> who &s;ays, "it is worthy of admiration, both on account of the agreeable valley through which it pa&s;&s;es, and the &s;and found on its borders." When foreign ve&s;&s;els &s;ail along the&s;e coa&s;ts, they take on board &s;ome of this &s;and, to &s;erve them as balla&s;t; and the Venetians carry away more of it for that purpo&s;e, than any other nation.</P>
<P>About eight leagues ea&s;t of Acre, near Lake Ta|baria, is a fountain of warm mineral waters. For want of being cleaned, it is filled with a black mud, which is a genuine Ethiops martial. Per&s;ons attacked by rheumatic complaints, find great relief, and are frequently cured by baths of this mud.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105">Balbeck, celebrated by the Greeks and Latins, under the name of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> or the city of the &s;un, is &s;ituated at the foot of Anti-Lebanon, preci&s;ely on the la&s;t ri&s;ing ground, where the mountain terminates in the plain. What principally attracts our attention here, is a large edifice, adjoining to the city; which, by its lofty walls and rich columns, manife&s;tly appears to be one of tho&s;e temples, which antiquity has left for our admiration. When we con&s;ider the extra|ordinary magnificence of this temple, we cannot but be a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ilence of the Greek and Roman authors re&s;pecting it. <HI>Wood,</HI> who has carefully exa|mined all the ancient writers, has found no mention of it, except in a fragment of <HI>John</HI> of Antioch, who attributes the con&s;truction of this edifice to <HI>Antoninus Pius.</HI> The in&s;criptions which remain corroborate this opinion. We are ignorant of the &s;tate of this city, in remote antiquity; but it is to be pre&s;umed, that its &s;ituation on the road from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it &s;ome part of the commerce of the&s;e opulent capitals. Under the Romans, in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> it is mentioned as a garri&s;on town. Its pre&s;ent &s;tate is deplorable.

This is a con&s;iderable trading town, and the chief emporium of Dama&s;cus. The French, who are the only Europeans to be found in it, have a con&s;ul, and five or &s;ix commercial hou&s;es. The manufacture of cotton is the principal art of the inhabitants; the number of whom, may be e&s;timated at about five thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Six leagues to the South of Saide, following the coa&s;t, is the ancient Tyre, now dwindled to a village of fifty or &s;ixty families.

In&s;tead of that ancient commerce, &s;o active and &s;o exten&s;ive, Tyre reduced to a mi&s;erable village, has no other trade than the exportation of a few &s;acks of corn, and raw cotton; nor any merchant but a &s;ingle Greek factor, in the &s;ervice of the French at Saide, who &s;carcely makes &s;ufficient profit to main|tain his family.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Pachalie of Dama&s;cus.</HEAD>
<P>THE pachalie of Dama&s;cus, the fourth and la&s;t of Syria, comprehends nearly the whole Ea&s;tern part of that country. The fir&s;t city that pre&s;ents it|&s;elf in this pachalie, is Dama&s;cus. It is &s;ituated in a large plain, open to the South and Ea&s;t, but &s;hut in to the North and We&s;t, by mountains, which limit the view at no great di&s;tance; but, in return, a num|ber of rivulets ari&s;e from the&s;e mountains, which ren|der the territory of Dama&s;cus the be&s;t watered, and mo&s;t delicious province of all Syria; the Arabs &s;peak of it with enthu&s;ia&s;m; and think they can never &s;uf|ficiently extol the fre&s;hne&s;s and verdure of its orchards, the abundance and variety of its fruits, its numerous &s;treams, and the clearne&s;s of its rills and fountains. This is al&s;o the only part of Syria, where there are de|tached plea&s;ure-hou&s;es in the open country. No city affords &s;o many canals and fountains; each hou&s;e has one; and all the&s;e waters are furni&s;hed by three ri|vulets, or branches of the &s;ame river, which, after fer|tilizing
<PB N="105" REF="108">
the gardens for a cour&s;e of three leagues, flow into a hollow of the de&s;art, to the South-ea&s;t, where they form a mora&s;s, called the mora&s;s of the mea|dow.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a &s;ituation it cannot be di&s;puted, that Dama&s;cus is one of the mo&s;t agreeable cities in Tur|key; but it is &s;till deficient in point of &s;alubrity. The inhabitants complain, that the white waters of the Barrada are cold and hard; and it is ob&s;erved, that the natives are &s;ubject to ob&s;tructions; that the white|ne&s;s of their &s;kin, is rather the palene&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, than the colour of health; and that the too great u&s;e of fruit, particularly of apricots, occa&s;ions there, every &s;ummer and autumn, intermittent fevers and dy|&s;enteries.</P>
<P>This city is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain eighty thou&s;and in|habitants. The greater part of the&s;e are Arabs and Turks; the number of Chri&s;tians are e&s;timated at above 15000. The Turks never &s;peak of the people of Dama&s;cus, without ob&s;erving, they are the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous in the whole empire: the Arabs, by a play on words, have made this proverb: <HI>&s;ham&eacute;, &s;houm&eacute;.</HI> The man of Dama&s;cus, wicked: on the con|trary, they &s;ay of the people of Aleppo, <HI>Halab&eacute;, tehelibi;</HI> the Aleppo man, a petit maitre. From pre|judice, owing to the difference of religions, they
<PB N="106" REF="109">
al&s;o add, that the Chri&s;tians there are more vile and knavi&s;h than el&s;ewhere. In this they re&s;emble the inhabitants of Cairo; like them they dete&s;t the Franks, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to appear at Dama&s;cus in a Euro|pean dre&s;s.</P>
<P>This hatred which the people of Dama&s;cus have for Chri&s;tians, ari&s;es from their communication with Mec|ca. Their city, they look upon to be a holy place, &s;ince it is one of the gates of the Caaba; for Dama&s;cus is the rendezvous for all the pilgrims from the North of A&s;ia, as Cairo is for tho&s;e from Africa. Their number every year, amounts from thirty to fifty thou&s;and; many repair hither four months, before the u&s;ual time; but the greate&s;t number only at the end of the Ramadan. Dama&s;cus then re&s;embles an im|men&s;e fair; nothing is to be &s;een but &s;trangers from all parts of Turkey, and even Per&s;ia; and every place is full of camels, hor&s;es, mules, and even mer|chandize. At length, after &s;ome days preparation, all this va&s;t multitude &s;et out confu&s;edly on their march; and, travelling by the confines of the de&s;art, arrive in forty days at Mecca, for the fe&s;tival of the Bairam. As this caravan traver&s;es the country of &s;everal independent Arab tribes, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make treaties with the Bedouins, for a free pa&s;&s;age, and take them for guides. Frequent di&s;putes ari&s;e on this &s;ubject, between the Shaiks, of which the
<PB N="107" REF="110">
pacha avails him&s;elf to make a better bargain; but, in general, the preference is given to the tribe of Sardia, which encamps to the Southward of Dama&s;cus, along the Hauran: the pacha &s;ends to the &s;haik, a mace, a tent, and a pelli&s;e, to &s;ignify he takes him as chief conductor. From this moment, it is the &s;haik's bu&s;ine&s;s to furni&s;h camels at a &s;tated price; the&s;e he hires from his tribe and his allies; the pacha is re&s;pon&s;ible for no lo&s;&s;es, which are all on the &s;haik's own account. On an average, ten thou&s;and camels peri&s;h yearly; which form a very advantageous article of commerce for the Arabs.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be imagined, that devotion is the &s;ole motive of all the&s;e expences and fatigues. Pecu|niary intere&s;t has a more con&s;iderable &s;hare in this ex|pedition. The caravan affords the means of engro&s;|&s;ing every lucrative branch of commerce; and almo&s;t all the pilgrims convert it into a matter of &s;pecula|tion. On leaving their own country, they load them|&s;elves with merchandize, which they &s;ell on the road; the &s;pecie ari&s;ing from this, added to what they have brought with them, is conveyed to Mecca, where they exchange it for all kinds of India goods. Sometimes the Arabs pillage the &s;tragglers, and carry off de|tached parties of the caravans. But, in general, the pilgrims arrive &s;afe, in which ca&s;e their profits are very con&s;iderable. At all events, they are recom|pen&s;ed in the veneration attached to the title of <HI>Hadji,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="111">
(pilgrim) and by the plea&s;ure of boa&s;ting to their coun|trymen, of the wonders of the Caabas, and Mount Ararat; of magnifying the prodigious crowds of pil|grims, and the number of victims on the day of the Bairam; and, recounting the dangers and fatigues they have undergone, the extraordinary figure of the Bedouins, the de&s;art without water, and the tomb of the prophet at Medina. The&s;e wonderful tales pro|duce their u&s;ual effect, that is, they excite the admi|ration and enthu&s;ia&s;m of the audience; though, from the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;incere pilgrims, nothing can be more wretched than this journey. Accordingly, this tran&s;ient admiration has not prevented a proverb, which does little honour to the&s;e pious travellers. <HI>Di&s;tru&s;t thy neighbour,</HI> &s;ays the Arab, <HI>if he has made a Hadj; but if he has made two, make ha&s;te to leave thy hou&s;e:</HI> and, in fact, experience has proved, that the greater part of the devotees of Mecca, are peculiarly in&s;olent and treacherous, as if they wi&s;hed to recom|pence them&s;elves for having been dupes, by becom|ing knaves.</P>
<P>By means of this caravan, Dama&s;cus is become the center of a very exten&s;ive commerce. By Aleppo, the merchants of this city corre&s;pond with Armenia, Anadolia, the Diarbekar, and even with Per&s;ia. They &s;end caravans to Cairo; which, following a route, frequented in the time of the patriarchs, take
<PB N="109" REF="112">
their cour&s;e by Tabaria, Nablous, and Gaza. In re|turn, they receive the merchandize of Con&s;tantinople, and Europe, by way of Saide and Bairout. The home-con&s;umption, is balanced by &s;ilk and cotton &s;tuffs, which are manufactured here in great quan|tities, and are very well made; by the dried fruits of their own growth, and &s;weetmeat cakes of ro&s;es, apri|cots, and peaches, of which Turkey con&s;umes to the amount of near a million of livres. The remainder, paid for by the cour&s;e of exchange, occa&s;ions a con|&s;iderable circulation of money, in cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties, and the commi&s;&s;ion of the merchants. This com|merce has exi&s;ted in the&s;e countries, from the mo&s;t remote antiquity. It has flowed, through different channels, according to the changes of the government, and other circum&s;tances; but it has every where left very apparent traces of the opulence it produced.</P>
<P>This city is al&s;o in great reputation for its &s;word|blades, and for all manner of cutlery-ware, the water being very proper for tempering iron and &s;teel.</P>
<P>Near Dama&s;cus, is a beautiful meadow of great ex|tent; from the earth of which, it is &s;aid, <HI>Adam</HI> was formed. There is al&s;o a grotto in it, and a Turki&s;h oratory, in which, St. <HI>Paul</HI> is &s;aid to have received his &s;ight after his vi&s;ion. The place is likewi&s;e &s;hewn,
<PB N="110" REF="113">
where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was let down from the wall in a ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>Another curio&s;ity in the city of Dama&s;cus is, a large coffee-hou&s;e, capable of containing between four and five hundred people, &s;haded with trees, in which is a &s;mall i&s;land, encircled with a rapid &s;tream of water. Here the Turks re&s;ort every day in great numbers, to &s;olace them&s;elves upon the <HI>duans,</HI> they being delighted with nothing &s;o much, as the &s;ight of water and verdure; and if, to the&s;e, a beautiful face is added, the three together, according to a Turki&s;h proverb, will bani&s;h the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate melancholy.</P>
<P>The <HI>duans,</HI> are broad &s;eats, rai&s;ed &s;ixteen or eigh|teen inches above the floor, which are covered with carpets, and furni&s;hed with cu&s;hions to lean on. In the hou&s;es of people of rank, at Dama&s;cus, the&s;e apartments are fitted up in a mo&s;t expen&s;ive and lux|urious &s;tile. In the&s;e, the Turks eat, drink, &s;leep, &s;moke, receive vi&s;its, and perform their devotions; and, a &s;tranger is &s;eldom permitted the &s;ight of any others.</P>
<P>Among other things de&s;erving of notice in this city, is the church of St. <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> now con|verted into a mo&s;que. This is a mo&s;t &s;pacious, lofty, and beautiful building; but a particular de&s;cription
<PB N="111" REF="114">
of it is difficult to be obtained; a Chri&s;tian being &s;carce allowed to &s;et his foot in it. There is one room in this church, in which the <HI>head of St. John the Bapti&s;t</HI> is kept, e&s;teemed &s;o very &s;acred by the Ma|hometans, that it is penal even for a Turk to go into this apartment. <HI>Maundrell</HI> relates, that he was told by a Turki&s;h nobleman, that they expected Our Sa|viour would de&s;cend into this mo&s;que, at the day of judgment, as <HI>Mahomet</HI> would into that of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>No Frank is permitted to ride on hor&s;eback, when he goes to vi&s;it the gardens, or other curio&s;ities round the city; he mu&s;t either walk on foot, or be mounted on an a&s;s; and for this purpo&s;e there are always a&s;&s;es, &s;tanding ready equipped in the &s;treets, to be hired. The rider has no occa&s;ion, when he is mounted, to u&s;e either whip or &s;pur, as the ma&s;ter of the a&s;s, or his &s;ervant, follows behind, and forces him along with a goad, &s;o that he performs his &s;tage in le&s;s time than could be expected from &s;o &s;luggi&s;h a crea|ture.</P>
<P>The &s;treet called <HI>Strait,</HI> in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, &s;till retains its name at Dama&s;cus; or at lea&s;t, they &s;hew one, that they pretend to be the &s;ame, which is about half a mile in length, but &s;o narrow with the hou&s;es jutting over, that its length and &s;traitne&s;s is not to be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115">At a little di&s;tance from Dama&s;cus, is a high hill, on which, according to tradition, <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> of|fered &s;acrifice; and where <HI>Cain</HI> afterwards killed his brother. A little further, is a Greek convent, called Sidonia, &s;ituated upon a &s;teep rock, on the &s;ide of a large valley; the a&s;cent of which, approaches &s;o nearly to the perpendicular, that people are obliged to go up to it by &s;tairs cut in the rock. In this con|vent, founded by <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> and remarkable for its ex|cellent wine, are about twenty Greek monks, and twice the number of nuns, who live together as in one family, without any &s;eparation. Such a retire|ment, with good wine, agreeable company, and fine women, can be no great mortification.</P>
<P>In this pachalie are al&s;o, celebrated remains of Pal|myra, a city famous in the third age of Rome, for the part it took in the differences between the Parthians and the Romans; and its de&s;truction under <HI>Aurelian.</HI> Hi&s;tory has &s;ince pre&s;erved the name of this great city; but it is merely the name, for the world had very confu&s;ed ideas of the real grandeur and power it had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. They were &s;carcely even &s;u&s;pected to exi&s;t, till, towards the end of the la&s;t century, &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants of Aleppo, tired with hearing the Bedouins talk of the immen&s;e ruins to be found in the de&s;art, re&s;olved to a&s;certain the truth of the&s;e extraordinary relations. Their narrative, publi&s;hed in the Philo&s;o|phical
<PB N="113" REF="116">
Tran&s;actions, met with many who refu&s;ed be|lief; men could neither conceive nor per&s;uade them|&s;elves, that in a &s;pot &s;o remote from any habitable place, &s;uch a magnificent city as their drawings de|&s;cribed, could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. But, &s;ince <HI>Dawkins</HI> publi&s;hed, in 1753, the plans and views he him&s;elf had taken on the &s;pot, in 1751, all doubts are at an end; and, it is univer&s;ally acknowledged, that anti|quity has left nothing, either in Greece or Italy, to be compared with the magnificence of the ruins of Palmyra.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to imagine any thing more &s;triking, &s;ays <HI>Wood,</HI> than the view of the&s;e ruins. So great a number of Corinthian pillars, with &s;o little wall, or &s;olid building, afford a mo&s;t romantic variety of pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>They are &s;aid to occupy an extent of more than 2600 yards, concealing a multitude of edifices behind them. In this &s;pace, are &s;ometimes found a palace, of which nothing remains but the courts and walls; &s;ometimes a temple, who&s;e peri&s;tyle is half thrown down; and now a portico, a gallery, or triumphal arch. Here &s;tand groups of columns, who&s;e &s;ymmetry is de&s;troyed by the fall of many of them; there they may be &s;een, ranged in rows of &s;uch length, that, &s;imilar to rows of trees, they deceive the &s;ight, and
<PB N="114" REF="117">
a&s;&s;ume the appearance of continued walls. If, from this &s;triking &s;cene, the traveller ca&s;ts his eyes upon the ground, another, almo&s;t as varied, pre&s;ents it&s;elf: on all &s;ides he beholds nothing but &s;ubverted &s;hafts, &s;ome whole, others &s;hattered to pieces, or di&s;located in their joints; and, on which &s;ide &s;oever he looks, the earth is &s;trewed with va&s;t &s;tones, half buried, with broken entablatures, damaged capitals, mutilated freezes, disfigured reliefs, effaced &s;culptures, violated tombs, and altars defiled by du&s;t.</P>
<P>We refer the reader to the plates of Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> for a more particular explanation of the&s;e ruins, and to make him &s;en&s;ible of the degree of perfection, to which the arts had arrived in the&s;e remote ages. Ar|chitecture, more e&s;pecially, lavi&s;hed her ornaments, and di&s;played her magnificence in the temple of the &s;un, the tutelar deity of Palmyra. The &s;quare court which &s;urrounded it, was &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-nine feet each way, and a double range of columns was continued all round the in&s;ide. In the middle of the vacant &s;pace, the temple pre&s;ents another of forty-&s;even feet, by one hundred and twenty-four in depth. Around it runs a peri&s;tyle of one hundred and forty columns; and, what is very extraordinary, the gate faces the &s;etting, and not the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">What arti&s;ts e&s;teem very &s;ingular is, that the front of this temple of the &s;un, re&s;embles the gallery of the Louvre, built by <HI>Perrault,</HI> long before the exi&s;tence of the drawings, which made us acquainted with it; the only difference is, that the columns of the Louvre are double, whereas tho&s;e of Palmyra are detached.</P>
<P>Within the court of this &s;ame temple, the philo&s;o|pher may contemplate a &s;cene, he will e&s;teem &s;till more intere&s;ting. Amid the&s;e hallowed ruins of the magnificence of a powerful and poli&s;hed people, are about thirty mud-walled huts, which contain as many pea&s;ant families, who exhibit every external &s;ign of ex|treme poverty. So wretched are the pre&s;ent inhabi|tants of a place once &s;o renowned and populous. The&s;e Arabs only cultivate a few olive-trees, and as much corn as is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. All their riches con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome goats and &s;heep they feed in the de&s;art. The Engli&s;h travellers, <HI>Wood</HI> and <HI>Daw|kins,</HI> inform us, that the&s;e pea&s;ants are healthy and well-&s;haped; and the few di&s;tempers they are &s;ubject to, prove, that the air of Palmyra, merits the eulo|gium be&s;towed on it by <HI>Longinus,</HI> in his epi&s;tle to <HI>Por|phyry.</HI> It &s;eldom rains there, except at the equi|noxes, which are accompanied by tho&s;e hurricanes of &s;and, &s;o dangerous in the de&s;art. The complexion of the&s;e Arabs, is very &s;warthy, from the exce&s;&s;ive heat; but this does not hinder the women from having
<PB N="116" REF="119">
beautiful features. They are veiled; but are not &s;o &s;crupulous of &s;hewing their faces, as the Ea&s;tern women generally are; they dye the end of their fingers red, their lips blue, and their eye-brows and eye-la&s;hes black; and wear very large gold or bra&s;s rings in their ears and no&s;es.</P>
<P>The travellers we have quoted, have made very ju|dicious remarks on the age which produced &s;o many monuments of indu&s;try and power, and the &s;ource of the immen&s;e riches they indicate, but too long to be in&s;erted here; and we mu&s;t again refer the curious reader to that work, to &s;ee in what manner they di&s;|tingui&s;h two &s;orts of ruins at Palmyra; one of which mu&s;t be attributed to very remote ages; while the others, which are the magnificent monuments &s;o often mentioned, are the work of more modern times. They demon&s;trate with great ingenuity, that Palmyra, &s;ituated three days journey from the Euphrates, was indebted for its wealth and &s;plendor, to the advantage of its po&s;ition on one of the great roads, by which the valuable commerce, that has at all times &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Europe and India, was then carried on; they have proved, in &s;hort, that the Palmyrenes were at the height of their pro&s;perity; when, become a barrier between the Romans and the Parthians, they were politic enough to maintain a neutrality in their
<PB N="117" REF="120">
di&s;putes, and to render the luxury of tho&s;e powerful empires, &s;ub&s;ervient to their own opulence.</P>
<P>Leaving the&s;e valuable ruins, and returning to the habitable world, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> we fir&s;t meet with Homs, the Eme&s;us of the Greeks, &s;ituated on the Ea&s;tern bank of the Orontes: this place, which was formerly a &s;trong and populous city, is, at pre&s;ent, only a large ruinous town, containing not more than two thou|&s;and inhabitants, partly Greeks, and partly Maho|metans.</P>
<P>Two days journey below Homs, is Hama, cele|brated in Syria for its water-works. The wheels are, in fact, the large&s;t in this country, being thirty-two feet in diameter. Troughs are fa&s;tened to the cir|cumference, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to fall into the river; and, when they reach the vertex of the wheel, di&s;|charge the water into a re&s;ervoir, whence it is con|veyed by conduits to the public and private baths. The town is &s;ituated in a narrow valley, on the banks of the Orontes, contains about four thou&s;and inha|bitants, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome trade, from its &s;ituation on the road from Aleppo to Tripoli. Further down the Orontes, is Famia, formerly one of the mo&s;t cele|brated cities of Syria, under the name of Apamea. The &s;oil of the neighbourhood, abounding in pa&s;tu|rage, fed no le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and mares, three
<PB N="118" REF="121">
hundred &s;tallions, and five hundred elephants; in|&s;tead of which, the <HI>marches</HI> of Famia, at pre&s;ent, &s;carcely afford a few buffaloes and &s;heep.</P>
<P>This is by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable pachalie in Syria; the pacha, be&s;ides an unbounded authority, is conductor of the &s;acred caravan of Mecca, under the highly re&s;pected title of Emir Hadj. The Maho|metans con&s;ider this office as &s;o important, and en|titled to &s;uch reverence, that the per&s;on of a pacha, who acquits him&s;elf well of it, becomes inviolable, even by the &s;ultan: it is no longer permitted to <HI>&s;ued his blood.</HI> But, the divan has invented a method of &s;atisfying its vengeance on tho&s;e protected by this pri|vilege, without departing from the literal expre&s;&s;ion of the law, by ordering them to be pounded in a mor|tar, or &s;mothered in a &s;ack; of which, there have been various in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The tribute of the pacha to the &s;ultan, is very tri|fling; five and forty pur&s;es, or between two and three thou&s;and pounds; but then he is &s;addled with all the expences of the Hadj; the&s;e are e&s;timated at between three and four hundred thou&s;and pounds. They con|&s;i&s;t in provi&s;ions, and the hire of the camels for the pilgrims. Be&s;ides this, one thou&s;and eight hundred pur&s;es mu&s;t be paid to the Arab tribes, to &s;ecure a free pa&s;&s;age. The pacha re-imbur&s;es him&s;elf, by the
<PB N="119" REF="122">
<HI>miri,</HI> or duty upon lands. Be&s;ides his other emolu|ments, the pacha is heir of all the pilgrims who die on the journey, and this is not the lea&s;t of his perqui&s;ites; it being invariably ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e are the riche&s;t of the pilgrims. Be&s;ides all this, he has the profits he makes by lending money on intere&s;t, to merchants and farmers, and taking from them whatever he thinks proper, in the way of <HI>bal&s;e,</HI> or extortion.</P>
<P>The pachalie of Dama&s;cus, from its &s;ituation, is more than any other expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the Bedouin Arabs; yet, it is remarked, to be the lea&s;t ra|vaged of any in Syria. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, that in&s;tead of frequently changing the pachas, as is prac|ti&s;ed in the other governments, the Porte u&s;ually be|&s;tows this pachalie for life: in the pre&s;ent century it was held for fifty years, by a rich family of Dama&s;cus. <HI>A&s;ad,</HI> the la&s;t of them, held it fifteen years; during which time, he did an infinite deal of good. His pa&s;&s;ion, like that of all men in office throughout Turkey, was to ama&s;s money, but he did not let it re|main idle in his coffers; and, by a moderation un|heard of in this country, required no more intere&s;t for it than &s;ix per cent. the u&s;ual intere&s;t being from twenty to forty. An anecdote is related of him, which will give an idea of his character. Being one day in want of money, the informers, by whom the pachas are con&s;tantly &s;urrounded, advi&s;ed him to
<PB N="120" REF="123">
levy a contribution on the Chri&s;tians, and on the ma|nufacturers of &s;tuffs. "How much do you think they may produce," &s;aid <HI>A&s;ad;</HI> "fifty or &s;ixty pur&s;es," re|plied they. "But," an&s;wered he, "the&s;e people are by no means rich, how will they rai&s;e that &s;um?" "My Lord, they will &s;ell their wives' jewels; and, be&s;ides, they are Chri&s;tian dogs." "Ill &s;hew you," replied the pacha, "that I am an abler extortioner than you!" The &s;ame day he &s;ent an order to the mu&s;ti, to wait upon him &s;ecretly, and at night. As &s;oon as the mu&s;ti arrived, <HI>A&s;ad</HI> told him, "he was in|formed, he had long led a very irregular life in pri|vate; that he, though the head of the law, had in|dulged him&s;elf in drinking wine, and eating pork, contrary to the precepts of the mo&s;t pure book; a&s;|&s;uring him, at the &s;ame time, he was determined to inform again&s;t him, to the Mu&s;ti of Stamboul, (Con|&s;tantinople) but that he wi&s;hed to give him timely notice, that he might not reproach him with perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s. The mu&s;ti, terrified at this menace, con|jured him to de&s;i&s;t; and, as &s;uch offers are an open and allowed traffic among the Turks, promi&s;ed him a pre&s;ent of a thou&s;and pia&s;tres. The pacha rejected the offer; the mu&s;ti doubled and trebled the &s;um, till, at length, they &s;trike a bargain for &s;ix thou&s;and pia&s;|tres, with a reciprocal engagement to ob&s;erve a pro|found &s;ilence. The next day, <HI>A&s;ad</HI> &s;ends for the cadi, and addre&s;&s;es him in the &s;ame manner; tells him,
<PB N="121" REF="124">
he is informed of &s;everal flagrant abu&s;es in his admi|ni&s;tration; and that he is no &s;tranger to a certain af|fair, which may, perhaps, co&s;t him his head. The cadi, confounded, implores his clemency, negociates like the mu&s;ti; accommodated the matter for a like &s;um, and retires, congratulating him&s;elf that he has e&s;caped even at that price. He proceeded in like manner with the wali; the aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries; and, after them, the wealthie&s;t Turki&s;h and Chri&s;tian mer|chants. Each of the&s;e, charged with offences pecu|liar to their &s;ituations; and, above all, accu&s;ed of in|trigues, were anxious to purcha&s;e pardon by contribu|tions. When the &s;um total was collected, the pacha, being again with his intimates, thus addre&s;&s;ed them, "Have you heard it reported at Dama&s;cus, that <HI>A&s;ad</HI> has been guilty of extortion?" No &s;eignior. "By what means then have I found the two hundred pur&s;es I now &s;hew you?" The informers began to exclaim in great admiration, and enquire what method he had employed. "I have fleeced the rams," replied he, "and &s;kinned the lambs and the kids."</P>
<P>After fifteen years reign, the people of Dama&s;cus were deprived of this man, by intrigues, the hi&s;tory of which, is thus related: About the year 1755, one of the black eunuchs of the &s;eraglio, making the pilgri|mage of Mecca, took up his quarters with <HI>A&s;ad;</HI> but, not contented with the &s;imple ho&s;pitality with which

he was entertained, he would not return by Dama&s;cus, but took the road to Gaza. <HI>Ho&s;ein,</HI> who was then go|vernor of that town, took care to give him a &s;umptuous entertainment. The eunuch, on his return to Con|&s;tantinople, did not forget the treatment he had re|ceived from his two ho&s;ts; and, to &s;hew his gratitude and re&s;entment, determined to ruin <HI>A&s;ad,</HI> and rai&s;e <HI>Ho&s;ein</HI> to his dignity. His intrigues was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that the following year, he obtained for him the pa|chalie of Dama&s;cus. <HI>A&s;ad</HI> thus depo&s;ed, retired with his hou&s;hold into the de&s;art, to avoid &s;till greater di&s;|grace. <HI>Ho&s;ein,</HI> conducted the caravan agreeable to the duty of his &s;tation; but, on his return, having quarrelled with the Arabs, concerning &s;ome payment they claimed, they attacked him, defeated the e&s;cort, and entirely plundered the caravan in 1757. On the news of this di&s;a&s;ter, the whole empire was thrown into as much confu&s;ion, as could have been occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t important battle. The families of twenty thou&s;and pilgrims, who had peri&s;hed with thir&s;t and hunger, or been &s;lain by the Arabs; the re|lations of a multitude of women, who had been car|ried into &s;lavery; the merchants intere&s;ted in the plundered caravan, all demanded vengeance on the cowardice of the <HI>Emir Hadj,</HI> but he concealed him|&s;elf &s;o well, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;urpri&s;e him; while he, from his retreat, acting in concert with the eunuch his protector, undertook to exculpate him&s;elf.
<PB N="123" REF="126">
The pachalie, however, remained vacant; <HI>Ho&s;ein,</HI> di&s;graced as he was, could not re&s;ume his govern|ment. The Porte, de&s;iring to revenge the late affront, and provide for the &s;afety of the pilgrims in future, made choice of a &s;ingular man, who&s;e character and hi&s;tory de&s;erves to be noticed. This man, named <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> was born near Bagdad, in an ob&s;cure &s;ta|tion. Entering very young into the &s;ervice of the pacha, he had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t years of his life in camps and war, and been pre&s;ent, as a common &s;oldier, in all the campaigns of the Turks, again&s;t <HI>Kouli-khan;</HI> and the bravery and intelligence he di&s;played, rai&s;ed him, &s;tep by &s;tep, even to the pacha of Bagdad. Ad|vanced to this eminent po&s;t, he conducted him&s;elf with &s;o much firmne&s;s and prudence, that he re&s;tored peace to the country, from both foreign and dome&s;tic wars. The &s;imple and military life he continued to lead, requiring no great &s;upplies of money, he ama&s;&s;ed none; but the great officers of the &s;eraglio of Con|&s;tantinople, who derived no profits from his modera|tion, did not approve of this di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and waited only for a pretext to remove him.</P>
<P>This they &s;oon found. <HI>Abd-allah</HI> had kept back the &s;um of about four thou&s;and pounds, ari&s;ing from the e&s;tate of a merchant. Scarcely had the pacha re|ceived it, before it was demanded of him. In vain did he repre&s;ent, that he had u&s;ed it to pay &s;ome old
<PB N="124" REF="127">
arrears of the troops; in vain did he reque&s;t time: the vizir only pre&s;&s;ed him the more clo&s;ely; and, on a &s;econd refu&s;al, di&s;patched a black eunuch, &s;ecretly provided with a kat-&s;herif, to take off his head. The eunuch arriving at Bagdad, feigned him&s;elf a &s;ick per&s;on, travelling for his health; and, as &s;uch, &s;ent his re&s;pects to the pacha; ob&s;erving the u&s;ual forms of politene&s;s, and reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to pay him a vi&s;it. <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> well acquainted with the practi&s;es of the divan, was di&s;tru&s;tful of &s;o much complai&s;ance, and &s;u&s;pected &s;ome &s;ecret mi&s;chief. His trea&s;urer, not le&s;s ver&s;ed in &s;uch plots, and greatly attached to his per&s;on, confirmed him in the&s;e &s;u&s;picions; and, in order to di&s;cover the truth, propo&s;ed to go and &s;earch the eunuch's baggage, while he and his retinue &s;hould be paying their vi&s;it to the pacha. <HI>Abd-allah</HI> approved the expedient; and, at the hour appointed, the trea&s;urer repaired to the tent of the eunuch, and made &s;o careful a &s;earch, that he found the kat-&s;herif concealed in the lapelles of a peli&s;&s;e. Immediately, he flew to the pacha, and, &s;ending for him into an ad|joining room, told him what he had di&s;covered. <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> furni&s;hed with the fatal writing, hid it in his bo&s;om, and returned to the apartment; when, re|&s;uming with an air of the greate&s;t indifference, his conver&s;ation with the eunuch: "The more I think of it," &s;aid he, "&s;ignior aga, the more I am a&s;to|ni&s;hed at your journey into this country; Bagdad is
<PB N="125" REF="128">
&s;o far from Stamboul, we can boa&s;t &s;o little of our air, that I can &s;carcely believe you have come hither for no other purpo&s;e, but the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your health." "It is true," replied the aga; "I am al&s;o commi&s;&s;ioned to demand of you, &s;omething on account of the four thou&s;and pounds you received." "We will &s;ay nothing of that," an&s;wered the pacha; "but come," added he with an air of firmne&s;s, "confe&s;s that you have likewi&s;e orders to bring with you my head. Ob&s;erve what I &s;ay, you know my character, and you know my word may be depended upon: I now a&s;&s;ure you that, if you make an open declaration of the truth, you &s;hall depart without the lea&s;t injury." The eunuch now began a long defence, prote&s;ting that he came with no &s;uch black intentions. <HI>"By my head,"</HI> &s;aid <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> confe&s;s the truth to me:" the eunuch &s;till denied. <HI>"By your head,"</HI> he &s;till denied: "take care, <HI>by the head of the &s;ultan;</HI>" he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted. "Be it &s;o," &s;ays <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> "the matter is decided, thou ha&s;t pronounced thy doom;" and drawing forth the kat-&s;herif, Know you this paper? Thus you go|vern at Con&s;tantinople. Yes, you are a troop of vil|lains, who &s;port with the lives of whoever happen to di&s;plea&s;e you; and &s;hed, without remor&s;e, the blood of the &s;ervants of the &s;ultan. The vi&s;ir mu&s;t have heads, he &s;hall have one; off with the head of that dog, and &s;end it to Con&s;tantinople." The order was
<PB N="126" REF="129">
executed on the &s;pot, and the eunuch's retinue di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, departed with their ma&s;ter's head.</P>
<P>After this deci&s;ive &s;troke, <HI>Abd-allah</HI> might have availed him&s;elf of his popularity to revolt; but he rather cho&s;e to retire among the Curds. Here the pardon of the &s;ultan was &s;ent him, and an order, ap|pointing him pacha of Dama&s;cus. Wearied of his exile, and de&s;titute of money, he accepted the com|mi&s;&s;ion, and &s;et out with one hundred men, who fol|lowed his fortune. On his arrival at the frontiers of his new government, he learnt, that <HI>A&s;ad</HI> was en|camped in the neighbourhood; he had heard him &s;poken of as the greate&s;t man in Syria, and was de|&s;irous of &s;eeing him. He, therefore, di&s;gui&s;ed him|&s;elf; and, accompanied only by &s;ix hor&s;emen, repaired to his camp, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. He was introduced, as is u&s;ual in their camps, without much ceremony; and, after the cu&s;tomary &s;alutations, <HI>A&s;ad</HI> enquired of him, whither he was going, and whence he came? <HI>Abd-allah</HI> an&s;wered, he was one of &s;ix or &s;even Curd hor&s;emen, who were &s;eeking employment; and hearing <HI>Satadji (Abd-allah</HI>'s other name) was ap|pointed to the pachalie of Dama&s;cus, were going to apply to him; but being informed on their way, that <HI>A&s;ad</HI> was encamped in the neighbourhood, they had come to reque&s;t of him provi&s;ions for them&s;elves and their hor&s;es. With plea&s;ure, replied <HI>A&s;ad,</HI> but do
<PB N="127" REF="130">
you know <HI>Satadji?</HI> Yes. What &s;ort of a man is he? Is he fond of money? No; <HI>Satadji</HI> cares very little for money, or peli&s;&s;es, or &s;hawls, or pearls, or women; he is fond of nothing but well-tempered arms, good hor&s;es, and war. He does ju&s;tice, protects the widow and the orphan, reads the Koran, and lives on butter and milk. Is he old? &s;aid <HI>A&s;ad.</HI> Fatigue has made him appear older than he is: he is covered with wounds; he has received a blow with a &s;abre, which has made him lame with his left leg; and another, which makes him lean his head on his right &s;houlder. In &s;hort, &s;aid he, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, he is, in &s;hape and fea|tures, exactly my picture. At the&s;e words, <HI>A&s;ad</HI> turned pale, and gave him&s;elf up for lo&s;t; but <HI>Abd-allah,</HI> &s;itting down again, &s;aid to him, brother, fear nothing; I am not &s;ent by a troop of banditti; I come not to betray thee; on the contrary, if I can render thee any &s;ervice, command me, for we are both held in the &s;ame e&s;timation with our ma&s;ters; they have recalled me, becau&s;e they wi&s;h to cha&s;ti&s;e the Bedou|ins; when they have gratified their revenge on them, they will again lay plots to deprive me of my head. <HI>God is great; what he hath decreed will come to pa&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments, <HI>Abd-allah</HI> repaired to Da|ma&s;cus; where he re&s;tored good order, put an end to the extortions of the &s;oldiery, and conducted the cara|van, &s;abre in hand, without paying a pia&s;tre to the
<PB N="128" REF="131">
Arabs. During his admini&s;tration, which la&s;ted two years, the country enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect tranquil|lity. The inhabitants of Dama&s;cus &s;till &s;ay, that under his government they &s;lept in &s;ecurity with open doors. He him&s;elf, frequently di&s;gui&s;ed as one of the poore&s;t of the people, &s;aw every thing with his own eyes. The acts of ju&s;tice he &s;ometimes did, in con|&s;equence of his di&s;coveries under the&s;e di&s;gui&s;es, pro|duced a &s;alutary circum&s;pection. Some in&s;tances are &s;till told by the people with plea&s;ure. It is &s;aid, for example, that being on his circuit at Jeru&s;alem, he had prohibited his &s;oldiers from either taking, or or|dering any thing without paying. One day when he was going about in the di&s;gui&s;e of a poor man, with a little plate of lentiles in his hand, a &s;oldier, who had a faggot on his &s;houlders, would force him to carry it. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, he took it on his back, while the <HI>Deliba&s;he</HI> following him, drove him on with im|precations. Another &s;oldier, knowing the pacha, made a &s;ign to his comrade, who in&s;tantly took to flight, and e&s;caped through the cro&s;s &s;treets. After proceeding a few paces, <HI>Abd-allah</HI> no longer hearing his man, turned round, and vexed at mi&s;&s;ing his aim, threw his burthen on the ground, &s;aying, the ra&s;cally knavi&s;h dog! he has both robbed me of my hire, and carried off my plate of lentiles. The &s;oldier did not long e&s;cape; a few days after, the pacha &s;urpri&s;ing
<PB N="129" REF="132">
him in the act of robbing a poor woman's garden, and ill treating her, ordered his head to be &s;truck off on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>As for him&s;elf, he was unable to ward off the de&s;|tiny he had fore&s;een. He was poi&s;oned by his nephew. This he di&s;covered before he died; and &s;ending for his murderer, Wretch that thou art, &s;aid he, the villains have &s;educed thee, thou ha&s;t poi&s;oned me to profit by my &s;poils: it is in my power, before I die, to bla&s;t thy hopes, and puni&s;h thy ingratitude; but I know the Turks, they will be my avengers. In fact, <HI>Satadji</HI> had &s;carcely breathed his la&s;t, before a Capidji produced an order to &s;trangle the nephew, which was executed.</P>
<P>Of the tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>O&s;man Darouich,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the following is a &s;triking in&s;tance. In the month of November, 1784, a village of Greek Chri&s;|tians near Dama&s;cus, which had paid the miri, was called upon to pay it a &s;econd time. The &s;haiks ap|pealing to the regi&s;ter, refu&s;ed to comply; but a night or two after, a party of &s;oldiers attacked the village, and &s;lew one and thirty per&s;ons. The wretched pea|&s;ants in con&s;ternation, carried the heads to Dama&s;cus, and demanded ju&s;tice of the pacha. After hearing their complaints, <HI>O&s;man</HI> told them, to leave the heads in the Greek church, while he made the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="130" REF="133">
inquiries. Three days elap&s;ed, and the heads putrify|ing the Chri&s;tians wi&s;hed to bury them; but to effect this, the pacha's permi&s;&s;ion was nece&s;&s;ary, for which they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of paying forty pur&s;es, or above two thou&s;and pounds. With &s;uch tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion in the officers of the Grand Signior, both at Con&s;tantinople, and in the different pacha|lies, who can but rejoice to &s;ee the downfall of the Turki&s;h empire?</P>
<P>We &s;hall, in our next chapter, take a view of the manners and cu&s;toms of the different nations, as they may more properly be termed, who inhabit the&s;e &s;e|veral pachalies.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the different Inhabitants of Syria.</HEAD>
<P>SYRIA as well as Egypt, has undergone revolu|tions, which have confounded the different races of its inhabitants. Within two thou&s;and years, we
<PB N="131" REF="134">
may reckon ten inva&s;ions, which have introduced into that country a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of foreign nations, &s;o that the people of Syria, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a mixture of inhabitants, and may be divided into three princi|pal cla&s;&s;es:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the po&s;terity of the people conquered by the Arabs, that is, the Greeks of the lower empire.</P>
<P>Secondly, the po&s;terity of the Arabian conquerors.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the pre&s;ent ruling people, the Ottoman Turks.</P>
<P>To the&s;e people, who are the cultivators, and &s;ettled inhabitants of Syria, mu&s;t &s;till be added, three other wandering tribes or pa&s;tors, viz. the Turcomen, the Curds, and the Bedouin Arabs.</P>
<P>Such are the different races di&s;per&s;ed over this country. In this enumeration, it is remarkable, that the ancient inhabitants have no remaining repre&s;enta|tive; their di&s;tingui&s;hing character is lo&s;t and con|founded in that of the Greeks, who, in fact, by a con|tinued re&s;idence from the days of <HI>Alexander,</HI> have had &s;ufficient time entirely to take place of the ancient people.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">Syria has not, like Egypt, refu&s;ed to adopt the fo|reign races. They all become equally naturalized to the country. The features and complexion are go|verned nearly by the &s;ame laws there, as in the South of Europe. There the inhabitants of the Southern plains, are more &s;warthy than tho&s;e of the Northern; and the&s;e more &s;o than the inhabitants of the moun|tains. In Lebanon, the complexion does not differ from that in the middle provinces of France. The women of Dama&s;cus and Tripoli, are greatly boa&s;ted for the fairne&s;s, and even regularity, of their fea|tures; but we mu&s;t take this prai&s;e on tru&s;t, &s;ince the veil they perpetually wear, allows no per&s;on to make nice ob&s;ervations. In &s;everal di&s;tricts, the women are le&s;s &s;crupulous without being le&s;s cha&s;te. In Pale&s;tine, for example, the married women may be &s;een almo&s;t uncovered; but want and fatigue, have robbed the countenance of all its charms; their eyes alone, are almo&s;t every where beautiful; and the long drapery, which forms their general dre&s;s, permits the body freely to di&s;play its &s;hape: it is &s;ometimes without elegance, but its proportions, at lea&s;t, are no ways in|jured. I do not recollect, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> having &s;een in Syria, nor even in Egypt, two per&s;ons crooked or de|formed. It is true, they are &s;trangers to tho&s;e tight|laced wai&s;ts, which, though &s;o much admired among us, are in no e&s;timation in the Ea&s;t; and the young women, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their mothers, very early &s;tudy,
<PB N="133" REF="136">
even &s;uper&s;titious receipts, to acquire an <HI>embon|point.</HI></P>
<P>The Syrians are, in general, of a middling &s;tature, and are, as in all warm countries, le&s;s corpulent than the inhabitants of the North. We find, however, in the cities, &s;ome individuals, who&s;e corpulency proves, that the influence of diet, is able to counterbalance, in a certain degree, that of climate.</P>
<P>Syria has no di&s;ea&s;e peculiar to it&s;elf, but the pimple of Aleppo, which we have noticed in &s;peaking of that city. Other di&s;orders are, dy&s;enteries and fevers, the con&s;equence of the bad fruits which the people greedily devour. The &s;mall-pox is &s;ometimes very fatal; but the general and mo&s;t frequent illne&s;s is the cholic, the cau&s;es of which are very evident, when we con&s;ider that every one eats to exce&s;s of un ripe fruit, raw vegetables, honey, chee&s;e, &s;trong oil, &s;our milk, and ill-fermented bread. The&s;e are the u&s;ual food of all the inhabitants; and the acid juices they contain, produce crudities, nau&s;ea, and even vomitings of bile. Accordingly, the fir&s;t pre&s;cription, in almo&s;t all di&s;orders, is an emetic; which method of treatment is only known to the European phy&s;icians. Bleeding is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor u&s;eful. In dangerous ca&s;es, cream of tartar and tamarinds, have the mo&s;t certain &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="137">Among the different inhabitants of Syria we have mentioned, &s;ome are di&s;per&s;ed, indifferently, over every part of the country; others confine them&s;elves to particular &s;pots, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to de|termine.</P>
<P>The Greeks, the Turks, and the Arabian pea&s;ants, belong to the former cla&s;s, with this difference, that the Turks re&s;ide only in the towns where they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the military employments, and the of|fices of the magi&s;tracy, and where they exerci&s;e the arts. The Arabs and Greeks inhabit the villages, and form the cla&s;s of hu&s;bandmen in the country, and the inferior people in the towns. That part of the coun|try which contains the mo&s;t Greek villages, is the pa|chalie of Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P>The Turcomen, the Curds, and the Bedouins, have no fixed habitations, but keep perpetually wandering with their tents and herds, in limited di&s;tricts, of which they look upon them&s;elves as the proprietors. The Turcoman hordes, generally encamp on the plain of Antioch; the Curds, in the mountains between Alex|andretta and the Euphrates; and the Arabs &s;pread over the whole frontier of Syria, adjacent to their de&s;arts.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="138">The Turkmen, or Turcomen, are of tho&s;e Tartar hordes, who, on the great revolutions of the empire of the Califs, emigrated from the Ea&s;tward of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and &s;pread them&s;elves over the va&s;t plains of America and A&s;ia-Minor. Their language is the &s;ame with that of the Turks, and their mode of life nearly &s;imilar to that of the Bedouin Arabs. Each of their camps acknowledges a chief, who&s;e power is not determined by fixed laws, but governed by cu&s;tom and circum&s;tances. It is rarely abu&s;ed, becau&s;e the &s;ociety is compact, and the nature of their &s;ituation maintains &s;ufficient equality among its mem|bers. Every man able to bear arms, is anxious to carry them, &s;ince on his individual force, depend both his per&s;onal &s;afety, and the re&s;pect paid him by his companions. All their property con&s;i&s;ts in cattle, that is camels, buffaloes, goats, and e&s;pecially &s;heep. They live on milk, butter, and meat, which are in great abundance among them; and the &s;urplus of which they &s;ell in the towns, and the neighbouring country. In return, they take arms, clothes, money, and corn. Their women &s;pin wool and make car|pets; the u&s;e of which is immemorial in the&s;e coun|tries, and con&s;equently indicates their manner of living to have been always the &s;ame. As for the men, their whole occupation con&s;i&s;ts in &s;moking, and look|ing after their flocks. Perpetually on hor&s;eback with their lances on their &s;houlders, their crooked &s;abres
<PB N="136" REF="139">
by their &s;ides, and their pi&s;tols in their belts; they are expert hor&s;emen, and indefatigable &s;oldiers. They have frequent differences with the Turks, who dread them; but as they are divided among them&s;elves, and form &s;eparate camps, they do not a&s;&s;ume that &s;upe|riority, which their combined forces would en&s;ure them. The pachalies of Aleppo and Dama&s;cus, which are the only parts of Syria they frequent, may be computed to contain about thirty thou&s;and wan|dering Turkmen. A great number of the&s;e tribes pa&s;s, in &s;ummer, into Armenia and Caramania, where they find gra&s;s in greater abundance, and return to their former quarters in winter.</P>
<P>The Turkmen are reputed Mu&s;&s;ulmen, and gene|rally bear the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark, circumci&s;ion. But they trouble them&s;elves very little about religion, and they have neither the ceremonies, nor the fanatici&s;m of &s;edentary nations. To de&s;cribe their manners ac|curately, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have lived among them. They have the reputation of not being robbers like the Arabs, though they are neither le&s;s generous, nor le&s;s ho&s;pitable; and, when we con&s;ider that they live in plenty, without being rich, and that they are inured to war, and hardened by fatigue and danger, we may pre&s;ume, they are equally removed from the ignorance and &s;ervility of the pea&s;ants, and the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and corruption of the inhabitants of towns.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="140">The Curds are another national body; the divided tribes of which, are equally di&s;per&s;ed over the Lower A&s;ia, and have extended them&s;elves pretty con&s;ider|ably, e&s;pecially within the la&s;t hundred years. The&s;e were the &s;ame Curds who are mentioned by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> under the denomination of <HI>Card-uchi,</HI> and who op|po&s;ed the retreat of the ten thou&s;and. This hi&s;torian ob&s;erves, that though &s;hut in on all &s;ides by the Per|&s;ian empire, they had con&s;tantly braved the power of the <HI>Great king,</HI> and the arms of his <HI>Satraps.</HI> They have changed but little in their modern &s;tate, and though in appearance, tributaries to the Porte, pay very little re&s;pect to the orders of the Grand Signior, or his pachas. In their mountains, they are &s;ubject to a &s;ort of foedal government; each village has its chief, and the whole nation is divided into different and independent factions. All their tribes united, are e&s;timated to exceed one hundred and forty thou|&s;and tents, that is one hundred and forty thou&s;and armed men. Like the Turkmen, the&s;e Curds are pa&s;tors and wanderers; but differ from them in &s;ome particular cu&s;toms. The Turkmen give their daugh|ters a marriage dower: the Curds receive a premium for theirs. The Turkmen pay no re&s;pect to nobility, the Curds honour it above every thing The Turk|men do not &s;teal: the Curds are almo&s;t every where looked upon as plunderers; on which account, they are much dreaded in the neighbourhood of Aleppo
<PB N="138" REF="141">
and Antioch, where they fix their tents. In this pa|chalie, and in that of Dama&s;cus, their number exceeds twenty thou&s;and. They are reputed Mahometans; but they never trouble them&s;elves about religious rites, or opinions. Several of them wor&s;hip <HI>Shaitan,</HI> or <HI>Satan,</HI> that is the genius who is the enemy of God.</P>
<P>Language is the principal indication of the con|&s;anguinity of nations. That of the Curds is divided into three dialects. It has neither the a&s;pirations, nor the gutturals of the Arabic; nor does it re&s;emble the Per&s;ian; &s;o that it mu&s;t be an original language. Now, if we con&s;ider the antiquity of the people who &s;peak it; and that we know they are related to the Medes, A&s;&s;yrians, Per&s;ians, and even the Parthians, we may be allowed to conjecture, that a knowledge of this tongue, might throw &s;ome light on the ancient hi&s;tory of the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>The third wandering people in Syria, are the Be|douin Arabs. In general, when &s;peaking of the Arabs, we &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h whether they are cultiva|tors, or pa&s;tors; this difference in their mode of life, occa&s;ioning a great one in their manners and genius. In the former ca&s;e, the &s;ocial &s;tate in which they live re&s;embles our own. In the &s;econd in&s;tance, their mode of exi&s;tence is neither that of poli&s;hed na|tions,
<PB N="139" REF="142">
nor of &s;avages. Such are the Bedouins, or in|habitants of the va&s;t de&s;arts, which extend from the confines of Per&s;ia to Morocco. Though divided into independent communities, or tribes, they may &s;till be con&s;idered as forming one nation. The re|&s;emblance of their language, is a manife&s;t token of this relation. In general, the Bedouins are &s;mall, meagre, and tawny; more &s;o, however, in the heart of the de&s;art, than on the frontiers of the cultivated country. In general, they do not exceed five feet two inches. This difference of height can only be attributed to their food. It may likewi&s;e be affirmed, that the lower cla&s;s of Bedouins, live in a &s;tate of ha|bitual wretchedne&s;s and famine. It is an undoubted fact, that the quantity of food u&s;ually con&s;umed by the greate&s;t part of them, does not exceed &s;ix ounces a day. Six or &s;even dates &s;oaked in melted butter, a little &s;weet milk or curds, &s;erve a man a whole day; and he e&s;teems him&s;elf happy when he can add a &s;mall quantity of coar&s;e flour, or a little ball of rice. Meat is re&s;erved for the greate&s;t fe&s;tivals; and they never kill a kid, but for a marriage or a funeral. A few wealthy and generous &s;haiks alone, can kill young camels, and eat baked rice with their victuals. In times of dearth, the vulgar, half fami&s;hed, do not di&s;|dain the mo&s;t wretched kinds of food; and eat lo|cu&s;ts, rats, lizards, and &s;erpents, broiled on briars.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="143">We have already &s;aid, the Bedouin Arabs are di|vided into tribes; each of which appropriates it&s;elf a tract of land. If another tribe enters upon this ter|ritory, they are treated as enemies, and a &s;kirmi&s;h commences. This combat is, however, decided by the fir&s;t &s;hock, and the vanqui&s;hed take to flight. But the &s;laughter made in the&s;e engagements, frequently &s;ows the &s;eeds of hatred, which perpetuate the&s;e di&s;|&s;en&s;ions. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed law among them, that the blood of every man who is &s;lain, mu&s;t be avenged by that of his murderer. So nice are the Arabs on this point of honour, that if any one neglects to &s;eek his retaliation, he is di&s;graced for ever. The&s;e ani|mofities are tran&s;mitted, from father to children, and never cea&s;e, but by the extinction of one of the fa|milies, unle&s;s they agree to &s;acrifice the criminal, or <HI>purcha&s;e the blood</HI> for a &s;tated price, in money, or flocks.</P>
<P>The government of the&s;e tribes is at once republi|can, ari&s;tocratical, and even de&s;potic, without exactly corre&s;ponding with any of its forms. It is republican, as the people have a great influence in all affairs, and nothing can be tran&s;acted without the con&s;ent of a majority. It is ari&s;tocratical, becau&s;e the families of the &s;haiks po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of the prerogatives which every where accompany power; and la&s;tly, it is de&s;potic, becau&s;e the principal &s;haik has an indefinite
<PB N="141" REF="144">
and almo&s;t ab&s;olute authority; which, when he hap|pens to be a man of credit and influence, he may even abu&s;e; but the &s;tate of the&s;e tribes confines even this abu&s;e to very narrow limits; for, if a chief &s;hould commit an act of inju&s;tice, if, for example, he &s;hould kill an Arab, it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape puni&s;hment; the re&s;entment of the in|jured party would pay no re&s;pect to his dignity, the law of retaliation would be put in force, and &s;hould he not pay the blood, he would be infallibly a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated. If he hara&s;&s;es his &s;ubjects by &s;everity, they abandon him, and go over to another tribe.</P>
<P>The principal &s;haik in every tribe, defrays the charges of all who arrive at, or leave the camp. He receives the vi&s;its of the allies, and of every per&s;on who has bu&s;ine&s;s with them. Adjoining to his tent is a large pavillion, for the reception of all &s;trangers and pa&s;&s;engers. In the&s;e pavillions, are held fre|quent a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;haiks, and principal men, to determine on encampments and removals, on peace and war; on the difference with the Turki&s;h governors, and the villages; and the litigations and quarrels of individuals. To this crowd which enters &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, he mu&s;t give coffee, bread baked on the a&s;hes, rice, and &s;ometimes roa&s;ted kid or camel; in a word, he mu&s;t keep open table; and it is the more important to him to be generous, as this genero&s;ity is clo&s;ely
<PB N="142" REF="145">
connected with matters of the greate&s;t con&s;equence. On the exerci&s;e of this, depends his credit and his power. The fami&s;hed Arab, ranks the liberality which feeds him before every virtue. To provide for the&s;e expences, the &s;haik has nothing but his herds, a few &s;pots of cultivated ground, the profits of his plunder, and the tribute he levies on the high roads; the total of which is very incon&s;iderable. We mu&s;t not, therefore, when we &s;peak of the Bedouins, affix to the word <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Lord,</HI> the ideas they u&s;ually convey: we &s;hould come nearer the truth, by com|paring them to &s;ub&s;tantial farmers, in mountainous countries, who&s;e &s;implicity they re&s;emble in their dre&s;s, as well as in their dome&s;tic life and manners. A &s;haik, who has the command of five hundred hor&s;e, does not di&s;dain to &s;addle and bridle his own, nor to give him barley and chopped &s;traw. In his tent, his wife makes the coffee, kneads the dough, and &s;uper|intends the dre&s;&s;ing of the victuals. His daughters and kin&s;women wa&s;h the linen, and go with pitchers on their heads, and veils over their faces, to draw water from the fountain. The&s;e manners agree pre|ci&s;ely with the de&s;criptions in <HI>Homer,</HI> and the hi&s;tory of <HI>Abraham</HI> in Gene&s;is.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity, or perhaps more properly, the po|verty of the lower cla&s;s of the Bedouins, is propor|tionate to that of their chiefs. All the wealth of a
<PB N="143" REF="146">
family con&s;i&s;ts of moveables, of which the following is a pretty exact inventory. A few male and female camels, &s;ome goats and poultry; a mare, and her bridle and &s;addle; a tent, a lance &s;ixteen feet long, a crooked &s;abre, a ru&s;ty mu&s;ket, a pipe, a portable mill, a pot for cooking a leathern bucket, a &s;mall coffee-roa&s;ter, a mat, &s;ome clothes, a mantle of black wool, and a few gla&s;s, or &s;ilver rings, which the women wear upon their legs and arms. If none of the&s;e be wanting, their furniture is complete. But, what the poor man &s;tands mo&s;t in need of, and what he takes mo&s;t plea&s;ure in, is his mare; for this animal is his principal &s;upport. With his mare, the Bedouin makes his excur&s;ions again&s;t ho&s;tile tribes, or &s;eeks plunder in the country, and on the highways. The mare is preferred to the hor&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he does not neigh, is more docile, and yields milk; which, on occa&s;ion, &s;atisfies the thir&s;t, and even the hunger of her ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Thus, confined to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ities of life, the Arabs have as little indu&s;try as their wants are few; all their arts con&s;i&s;t in weaving their clum&s;y tents, and making mats and butter. Their whole commerce only extends to exchanging camels, kids, &s;tallions, and milk; for arms, clothing, a little rice, or corn, and money which they bury. They are to|tally ignorant of all &s;cience, and have not even any
<PB N="144" REF="147">
idea of a&s;tronomy, geometry, or medicine. They have not a &s;ingle book, and nothing is &s;o uncommon among the &s;haiks, as to know how to read. All their literature con&s;i&s;ts in reciting tales and hi&s;tories, in the manner of the Arabian Nights Entertainments. They have a peculiar pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch &s;tories; and employ, in them, almo&s;t all their lei&s;ure. In the evening, they &s;eat them&s;elves on the ground, at the thre&s;hold of their tents, or under cover, if it be cold; and there, ranged in a circle round a little fire of dung, their pipes in their mouths, and their legs cro&s;&s;ed, they &s;it awhile in &s;ilent meditation; till, on a &s;udden, one of them breaks forth with, <HI>Once upon a time</HI>&mdash;and con|tinues to recite the adventures of &s;ome young &s;haik, and female Bedouin: he relates in what manner the youth got a &s;ecret glimp&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s; and how he became de&s;perately enamoured of her; he minutely de&s;cribes the lovely fair, boa&s;ts her black eyes, as large and &s;oft as tho&s;e of the gazalle; her languid and em|pa&s;&s;ioned looks, her arched eye-brows, re&s;embling two bows of ebony; her wai&s;t &s;trait, and &s;upple as a lance; he forgets not her &s;teps, light as tho&s;e of the <HI>young filley;</HI> nor her eye-la&s;hes blackened with <HI>kohl,</HI> nor her lips painted blue, nor her nails, tinged with the golden coloured <HI>henna,</HI> nor her brea&s;ts re&s;embling two pomegranates, nor her words, &s;weet as honey. He recounts the &s;ufferings of the young lover, <HI>&s;o wa&s;ted with de&s;ire and pa&s;&s;ion, that his body no longer yields any
<PB N="145" REF="148">
&s;hadow.</HI> The Bedouins have likewi&s;e their love|&s;ongs, which have more &s;entiment and nature in them than tho&s;e of the Turks.</P>
<P>The Arabs have often been reproached with a &s;pirit of rapine, but, without wi&s;hing to defend it, we may ob&s;erve, that one circum&s;tance has not been &s;ufficiently attended to; which is, that it only takes place to|wards reputed enemies, and is con&s;equently founded on the acknowledged laws of all nations. Among them&s;elves they are remarkable for a good faith, a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, a genero&s;ity which would do honour to the mo&s;t civilized people. What is there more noble, than that right of a&s;ylum &s;o re&s;pected among all the tribes? A &s;tranger, nay, even an enemy touches the tent of the Bedouin, and from this in&s;tant, his per&s;on becomes inviolable. It would be reckoned a di&s;graceful meanne&s;s, an indelible &s;hame, to &s;atisfy even a ju&s;t vengeance at the expence of ho&s;pitality. Has the Bedouin con&s;ented to eat bread and &s;alt with his gue&s;t? nothing in the world can induce him to be|tray him. The power of the Sultan him&s;elf, would not be able to force a refuge, from the protection of a tribe, but by its total extermination. The Bedouin, &s;o rapacious without his camp, has no &s;ooner &s;et his foot within it, than he becomes liberal and generous. What little he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he is ever ready to divide. He has even the delicacy not to wait till it is a&s;ked:
<PB N="146" REF="149">
when he takes his repa&s;t, he affects to &s;eat him&s;elf at the door of his tent, in order to invite the pa&s;&s;engers; his genero&s;ity is &s;o &s;incere, that he does not look upon it as a merit, but merely as a duty. To ob&s;erve the manner in which the Arabs conduct them&s;elves to|wards each other, one would imagine that they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all their goods in common. Neverthele&s;s, they are no &s;trangers to property; but it has none of that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which the increa&s;e of the imaginary wants of luxury, has given it among poli&s;hed na|tions.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, the Bedouins, from po|licy, pre&s;erve the appearance of Mahometani&s;m; but &s;o relaxed is their ob&s;ervance of its ceremonies, and &s;o little fervor has their devotion, that they are gene|rally con&s;idered as infidels who have neither law nor prophets. They even make no difficulty in &s;aying, that the religion of Mahomet was not made for them; "for," add they, "how &s;hall we make ablutions who have no water? How can we be&s;tow alms who are not rich? Why &s;hould we fa&s;t in the Ramadan, &s;ince the whole year with us is one continual fa&s;t? and what nece&s;&s;ity is there for us to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, if God be pre&s;ent every where?" In &s;hort, every man acts and thinks as he plea&s;es, and the mo&s;t perfect toleration is e&s;tabli&s;hed among them.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="150">Be&s;ides the Arabs of the above de&s;cription, there are others who re&s;ide in the cities of Syria and Pale&s;|tine, and who are more poli&s;hed than the re&s;t of their countrymen. Their manner of dre&s;&s;ing and behaving in company, gives them a greater re&s;emblance to the Turks. The&s;e people generally carry on their com|mercial affairs, with much uprightne&s;s and integrity, and &s;ubmit to the government under which they live, without forgetting they are &s;prung from I&s;hmael, that the Arabs boa&s;ting they are de&s;cended from I&s;hmael, the &s;on of Abraham and Agar. They, accordingly &s;hew a wonderful affection for the inhabitants of the de&s;art, whom they alone con&s;ider as de&s;cended from noble and illu&s;trious blood. The greater part of tho&s;e real Arabs, who are fixed in cities, do not &s;uf|fer their beards to grow till they are advanced in years; but the other inhabitants of the de&s;art, never cut theirs at all. They carry their re&s;pect for the beard &s;o far, that to touch it when they &s;wear, is as &s;olemn an oath, as that of the ancient gods, when they &s;wore by the river Styx. They take very great care to keep it clean; and it may be ea&s;ily conceived, they con&s;ider it a great affront when any one pulls them by this venerable ornament.</P>
<P>Though the Bedouin Arabs are exceedingly poor, there are others who live under tents, in valleys ad|joining to the cities, who&s;e flocks are more abundant,
<PB N="148" REF="151">
and who are not that half &s;tarved race like the Be|douins, or tho&s;e Arabs, who wander more upon the extremities, and the mo&s;t de&s;art part of this pro|vince.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Arabs <HI>Mariti</HI> &s;eems to have in view, when he &s;ays, they are of a middle &s;tature, their com|plexion brown, and that they have always a grave and melancholy air. Misfortunes give them no pain, and they derive no plea&s;ure from pro&s;perity, becau&s;e they receive with re&s;ignation both good and evil from the hand of God. Equally in&s;en&s;ible to the cries of their children, and to the tears of their wives, their vi&s;ages exhibit no kind of alteration whatever. They &s;eldom laugh, and never weep: to do either, in their opinion, &s;hews great weakne&s;s; and, on this account, they have very little e&s;teem for a man who weeps or laughs too much. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, for the Europeans to affect great indifference when among&s;t them, and to imitate their &s;erious and melancholy be|haviour: with a little attention in this re&s;pect, their friend&s;hip and e&s;teem may ea&s;ily be had.</P>
<P>The&s;e people derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from flocks, from hunting, and from what they acquire by plunder. The acknowledge no &s;overeigns, but the Emirs of their tribes, who are their natural princes, and to whom they pay obedience. They have al&s;o &s;haiks,
<PB N="149" REF="152">
who are per&s;ons of an advanced age, whom they often con&s;ult, and who&s;e advice they follow. As there are no fixed judges among the Arabs, the&s;e &s;haiks &s;upply the place, and from their determination there is no appeal.</P>
<P>Though polygamy is permitted to the Arabs, by the law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which they follow, it is rare to &s;ee them have more wives than one.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of &s;moaking, &s;o common even among the women, is al&s;o one of the amu&s;ements of the Arabs, who may be &s;een &s;itting from morning to night with their pipes in their mouths.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Arabs, con&s;i&s;ts only of a white robe bound round with a broad leathern girdle, which may be &s;traitened or &s;lackened at plea&s;ure, by means of &s;trong buckles, or a large cla&s;p, with a few &s;maller ones. Winter and &s;ummer, they wear a large cloak, &s;triped black and white, and made of the hair of goats, or &s;ome other animal. In winter, they u&s;e it to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the cold and rain, and in &s;ummer to &s;creen them from the heat of the &s;un. They wear nothing on their heads but a kind of red cap, &s;urrounded with a piece of cloth of the &s;ame colour, or intermixed &s;ometimes with white, which forms all its ornaments. Their Emirs, or princes,
<PB N="150" REF="153">
dre&s;s in the &s;ame manner, except, that their cloaks are for the mo&s;t part all black.</P>
<P>They wear &s;lippers after the manner of the Turks; but they are generally in half boots, in order that they may be ready at all times to mount on hor&s;eback. Some Arabs who are employed in agriculture, in|&s;tead of &s;lippers, wear only two &s;oles of leather fa&s;|tened under the foot, at the toe and heel, and form|ing a kind of &s;andal. Their drawers are made of linen, and de&s;cend to the lower part of the leg.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arabs have no habitations, but tents; they generally &s;top in valleys, taking always the precaution to place &s;ome of their tents on a neighbouring hill, to prevent their being &s;urprized by different tribes who are their enemies. Be&s;ides this, being on the watch, they are able to fall on travellers unexpectedly, whom they are contented to rob, without offering any per&s;onal in&s;ult, provided no ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance is made.</P>
<P>The riches of the&s;e Arabs con&s;i&s;t in cattle, which &s;upply them with fle&s;h, milk, butter, and wool, the principal articles they have occa&s;ion for, as they de|&s;pi&s;e luxury of every kind.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="154">What they value mo&s;t, is their fine hor&s;es, and e&s;|pecially tho&s;e that are &s;wift in running. They di&s;|tingui&s;h them into three races, and are very curious in pre&s;erving their genealogy. Tho&s;e of the two fir&s;t races, are of a moderate height, but exceedingly &s;len|der and &s;wift; they never neigh, and eat only once in the four and twenty hours. In the evening, which is the time they are fed, a mea&s;ure of barley is &s;u&s;|&s;pended from their necks in a bag. If they are fa|tigued, they do not receive their allowance till an hour later: but they are &s;uffered to drink almo&s;t every moment; even when covered with du&s;t, and in the mid&s;t of their labour. When they arrive at their tents, they are unbridled, and tied to a lance fixed in the ground, by means of a rope which pa&s;&s;es round their necks. If it be a mare, &s;he is tied by the foot; but the &s;addles are never taken from their backs, ex|cept when they are combed. The Arabs have a greater number of mares than of hor&s;es, becau&s;e they are better able to endure fatigue, hunger, and thir&s;t; and becau&s;e they require much le&s;s care.</P>
<P>About the time when the hor&s;es cover, they &s;uffer them to feed in the open fields for the &s;pace of fifteen days, after which they carry witne&s;&s;es with them, to certify what breed the hor&s;e is. They do the &s;ame thing at the birth of the foal; and mark upon a card, the month, day, and hour, together with the origin of
<PB N="152" REF="155">
the animal, and the colour of its hair. This card, called <HI>cogget,</HI> and containing different atte&s;tations, is put into a &s;mall bra&s;s ball, and &s;u&s;pended by a &s;tring from the colt's neck, where it remains during the whole time of its life: in &s;hort, that happy day is ce|lebrated by a fe&s;tival they give to their friends. The Arabs wait till their hor&s;es have attained the age of three years, before they put a bit into their mouths; and &s;uffer the fourth year to elap&s;e before they mount them. In this interval, they exerci&s;e them conti|nually as we do in Europe, by making them run round in a circle. At the end of four years, they are &s;hod and prepared for a particular kind of cour&s;ing, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;etting off on full gallop, &s;topping &s;hort &s;uddenly, turning to the right and left, and retreating when the rider di&s;charges his lance. It is cu&s;tomary for the Arabs to attack their enemies with great im|petuo&s;ity, and then to fly back with the like &s;peed. They, therefore, in&s;truct their hor&s;es to &s;toop a little, by leaning towards one &s;ide, to enable the rider to recover his arms, without being obliged to di&s;mount. Whil&s;t they are accu&s;toming them to the&s;e different manoeuvres, they never make u&s;e of the whip, but employ &s;purs, with the points of which they prick the &s;ides of the hor&s;e, according as they judge it nece&s;|&s;ary. At the end of five years, they cut their tails, in order that they may grow afterwards, according to their natural di&s;po&s;ition. They keep their hoofs
<PB N="153" REF="156">
very &s;hort, but make them advance a little beyond the &s;hoe, which is formed of a piece of very thin iron.</P>
<P>Arabian hor&s;es increa&s;e in &s;trength, in propor|tion as they are exerci&s;ed in running, and it is very ea&s;y when they are &s;topped, to make them pur&s;ue &s;uch a pace as one wi&s;hes. When galloping, they carry their heads high, but &s;uffer them to droop a little on an ordinary trot. If the rider &s;hould throw the bridle loo&s;e upon their necks, they would make no motion; and he might continue his journey in perfect &s;afety, without taking it again into his hand. If he be di&s;mounted by any accident, the hor&s;e will not advance a &s;tep further, but immediately &s;tops till he gets up. The Arabs, properly &s;peaking, do not make u&s;e of a bridle, but of a halter; and, in order to remain firm in their &s;eats, becau&s;e their &s;ad|dles are high, they pre&s;s their legs &s;trongly again&s;t the hor&s;e's &s;ides. Their manner of &s;itting on hor&s;eback is perfectly carele&s;s; and, in this re&s;pect, they do not di&s;play that gracefulne&s;s by which the Turks are di&s;|tingui&s;hed. They are, however, far from being bad hor&s;emen; when they wi&s;h to make their hor&s;es gal|lop, they bend their bodies a little, and lean forwards, which is a &s;ufficient &s;ignal for the animal to &s;et out full &s;peed.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="157">When they mount their hor&s;es, they are almo&s;t always armed with lances, twelve or fourteen feet in length, which they handle with great dexterity; but they have a &s;maller kind for darting again&s;t the enemy, as they retain the former always in their hands. They carry mu&s;kets likewi&s;e, but they are much ter|rified when they engage with fire-arms, being &s;o little accu&s;tomed to them; and, after the fir&s;t di&s;charge, they become ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The features of the Arab women are remarkably beautiful, when young; but they &s;oon become dis|figured, by certain black &s;pots like patches, which they make in their faces with a &s;harp-pointed iron. They mark with the &s;ame colour their lips and eye|la&s;hes, by mixing, with the paint employed for that purpo&s;e, a certain &s;ub&s;tance which they call <HI>colia&s;tri.</HI> According to the general cu&s;tom of the Levant, they dye their nails, and the palms of their hands, yellow.</P>
<P>Young girls make an opening near one of the no&s;|trils, into which they put a clove: this appears to them to be a peculiar beauty, which they con&s;ider as a &s;ign of virginity; though they continue to wear it even after they have had children. There are &s;ome, who, in&s;tead of a clove, thru&s;t through their no&s;trils a &s;ilver ring, about an inch and an half in
<PB N="155" REF="158">
diameter; from the bottom of which is &s;u&s;pended a piece of coral, or &s;ome &s;mall coin.</P>
<P>One difference is remarked, between the Arab men and women; which is, that the latter, much le&s;s &s;erious when young, become peevi&s;h and melan|choly with age: whil&s;t the men acquire with years, an opener and freer air. This difference, indeed, may be remarked among the people of every nation whatever: a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, and of being loved, is the fir&s;t &s;entiment that ari&s;es in the mind of a woman; and it grows and increa&s;es as &s;he approaches towards maturity; but, as love accompanies beauty only, and as beauty di&s;appears with youth, it is not a&s;toni&s;hing that a woman &s;hould become moro&s;e as &s;he advances in life. Having lo&s;t the power of charming, &s;he is no longer followed; and this neglect &s;he is by no means able to &s;upport. With men, the ca&s;e is quite different, being formed for accompli&s;hing great things, they &s;eem to abandon their nature, when they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be overcome by love.</P>
<P>The Arab women wear only a plain robe, after the Turki&s;h manner, and &s;carcely ever cover their heads. Their cloaks re&s;emble tho&s;e of the men, but there are only few who u&s;e drawers, according to the cu&s;tom of the poli&s;hed people of the Ea&s;t. They ornament their hair, with &s;trings of &s;mall gla&s;s beads, of different
<PB N="156" REF="159">
colours; on their legs and arms they wear bracelets of the &s;ame, and have rings made of metal on their fingers.</P>
<P>The principal occupation of the Arab women, is to take care of the tents in which they lodge, to pro|vide water, to prepare food, to milk their flocks, and to make butter and chee&s;e. They likewi&s;e manufac|ture the cloth nece&s;&s;ary for covering their tents.</P>
<P>As there are no longer any phy&s;icians among the Arabs, the care of the &s;ick is committed entirely into the hands of women. Among other di&s;ea&s;es, they cure the drop&s;y &s;o perfectly, that the patient is never afterwards &s;ubject to it. They are acquainted with the virtues of herbs, and employ them with great &s;uc|ce&s;s. The Arabs almo&s;t always u&s;e &s;carification in their cures, and e&s;pecially for pains. On the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ation, they apply a red hot iron to the part af|fected, and are freed from their complaint by this violent remedy. This is the rea&s;on why &s;o many of the Arabs may be &s;een with &s;cars on different parts of their bodies.</P>
<P>The Arabs make very little u&s;e of bread. Their u&s;ual food is roots, honey, milk, butter, mutton, and the fle&s;h of their camels; and birds which they may catch alive; becau&s;e it is an article of the Mahome|tan
<PB N="157" REF="160">
law, to kill tho&s;e animals which they eat, and to ex|tract their blood. They con&s;ume a great deal of rice, particularly in their pilau. For &s;ea&s;oning the greater part of their di&s;hes, they employ &s;our and curdled milk, which they mix with leaven.</P>
<P>The Arabians have another kind of food, which appears to us &s;till more &s;ingular. This food is the fle&s;h of locu&s;ts, which they collect in the &s;ea&s;on, when they pa&s;s through their country; and having taken off their heads, put them into leather bags, with a cer|tain quantity of &s;alt. When they eat them, they cut them into &s;lices as we do &s;au&s;ages.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the various beverages of the Arabs, water holds the fir&s;t rank. They make &s;uch a continual u&s;e of coffee, that they can drink it like the Turks almo&s;t at every hour of the day; but in &s;mall quan|tities, and without &s;ugar. They compo&s;e another kind of drink with roots, and the juice of the &s;ugar|cane, and of grapes mixed with water. They have al&s;o a third, made with an infu&s;ion of barley, which has a great re&s;emblance with our barley.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality is &s;o much honoured among all the Arabs, that, without regard to religion or country they will receive in their tent every traveller who ap|plies to them, and take the &s;ame care of his &s;ervant
<PB N="158" REF="161">
and his hor&s;e. After making him &s;it down on a mat, commodiou&s;ly &s;pread on the ground, they pre&s;ent him with a pipe, and coffee; and every now and then a&s;k him how he does. They then prepare &s;omething for him to eat, and offer him their di&s;hes, with that &s;implicity which is &s;o common among them; and an|nounces by their countenances, the great happine&s;s they experience in being able to do him any &s;ervice. If he wi&s;hes to pa&s;s the night in their habitation, they arrange the &s;ame mat in the form of a bed; and place under one end of it his &s;tone, or a &s;addle to &s;erve him for a pillow. Should the traveller at his departure offer his ho&s;t a piece of money, becau&s;e he appears to be poor, it would be accepted with grati|tude; but if he gave nothing, the Arab would te&s;tify no di&s;&s;atisfaction whatever. It may not here be im|proper, to de&s;cribe the manner of eating among the Arab lords, which is a little different from that of the Turks.</P>
<P>After the floor is covered with different pieces of tape&s;try, a long table, rai&s;ed about three or four in|ches from the ground, and which is only two feet in breadth, is placed in the middle of the apartment, without a cloth &s;pread over it, and without any orna|ment. Several di&s;hes filled with pilau, or rice baked, without &s;auce, and a &s;heep roa&s;ted whole, with its belly &s;tuffed, compo&s;e the fir&s;t cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162">If the number of per&s;ons at table &s;hould amount to thirty, a &s;econd &s;heep is added. This principal cour&s;e is followed by &s;everal di&s;hes, containing boiled greens and pul&s;e, with meat &s;ea&s;oned in various ways; and then comes the la&s;t cour&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall ba&s;ons of milk, rendered &s;our by means of leaven. In &s;uch repa&s;ts as the&s;e they never employ knives, forks, plates, towels, or gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>When the di&s;hes are ranged in order, the gue&s;ts, having wa&s;hed their hands and pulled off their &s;lip|pers, approach the table with their chief, who invokes the benediction of heaven on the fe&s;tival. Each then &s;its down on the floor with his legs cro&s;&s;ed, and a do|me&s;tic &s;preads over their knees a long cloth, which &s;erves the whole company. They then begin to eat without any further compliment.</P>
<P>The Europeans, accu&s;tomed to ceremony, and above all to cleanline&s;s, would not find them&s;elves. very comfortable at &s;uch tables. Their delicate &s;to|machs would be apt to become &s;queami&s;h, when they &s;aw each gue&s;t put his hand into the di&s;hes, touch all the ragouts with it, and, filling it with a mixture of fle&s;h and pilau, form it into &s;mall balls, and then pre&s;s the whole into his mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163">With regard to their beverage, which is always water, it is &s;upplied by the neare&s;t dome&s;tic, and is drank from a cup made of baked earth, or a cocoa|nut, and &s;carcely ever from gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>They remain a very &s;hort time at table, and ri&s;e all together to thank God for their good appetite. After again wa&s;hing their hands, they retire to another hall, where &s;ome fruits are prepared, which form part of the de&s;ert. In the u&s;e of the&s;e &s;weet things, they are very moderate, which are carried away almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are &s;erved up. Coffee and pipes are brought in the la&s;t place, with which they regale them|&s;elves, &s;itting in a circle.</P>
<P>The remains of their table are placed before their attendants, and from them are carried to the inferior &s;ervants. But will the reader be able to gue&s;s for whom the &s;craps left by all the&s;e wretches are de&s;ign|ed? Will it be believed in tho&s;e countries of Europe, which make it their boa&s;t to pay the mo&s;t flattering at|tention to the fair &s;ex; where they are treated with all the re&s;pect due to queens; where, when the table is loaded with the mo&s;t delicate viands, and the choice&s;t dainties, nothing appears good but what is pre&s;ented by their fair hands; and where the ma&s;ter him&s;elf will not venture to touch the &s;malle&s;t article
<PB N="161" REF="164">
without their permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;that, among the&s;e barba|rous people, what has e&s;caped the teeth of the filthie&s;t &s;lave, is carried to the women, and even to the mi&s;|tre&s;s of the hou&s;e? The&s;e women drink coffee, and &s;moke in the &s;ame manner as the men.</P>
<P>The Arabs we have now been de&s;cribing, pa&s;&s;ed from the de&s;arts of Arabia, to Syria and Pale&s;tine, in the &s;ixth century; and &s;ince that period, they have &s;till more or le&s;s pre&s;erved their footing in the&s;e coun|tries. All the inhabitants of the coa&s;ts, or of the interior parts, who &s;peak the Arabic language only, are comprehended under their name.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Dru&s;es, and Mutuales.</HEAD>
<P>THE country of Ca&s;travent, a part of Mount Le|banon, is inhabited, in preference to any other &s;pot, by the Dru&s;es. The religion of the&s;e people, is one of the mo&s;t modern in the Ea&s;t, &s;ince it is not older than 1030. The principles of this religion, are almo&s;t entirely unknown: their &s;acred books pre|&s;enting nothing but a &s;eries of errors and ob&s;curities. Their religion, however, &s;eems to be a mixture of Mahometani&s;m, and Chri&s;tianity. They pray indif|ferently in the Greek churches, and the Turki&s;h mo&s;ques.</P>
<P>Their language is that of the Arabs, which is the only one familiar to the different people of Syria.</P>
<P>The Dru&s;es are a robu&s;t, well-made people, and of a noble a&s;pect, for which they are in part indebted to their education.&mdash;They are accu&s;tomed from their infancy, to hard&s;hips and fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166">When mothers lay their children in the cradle, in|&s;tead of putting their pillow under their head, as is cu&s;tomary among us, they put it under their reins, &s;o that the head remains in a hanging po&s;ition. Wrap|ping up the legs afterwards with bandages, they bring the two calves together, taking care to extend their toes outwards; and this gives them, when old, that maje&s;tic carriage by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>In their di&s;po&s;ition, they are naturally faithful and &s;incere. They are fond of the Europeans, to whom they perform every duty that humanity requires, and on every occa&s;ion protect and defend them, as far as lies in their power. As they have very great aver|&s;ion to u&s;ury, they cannot endure the roguery of the Turks, or the avarice of the Hebrews.</P>
<P>The Dru&s;es have particular princes, called Emirs, who are &s;even in number; and who, in conjunction, all govern the &s;ame country. One of them has the title of Grand Emir, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;upreme autho|rity, being pre&s;ident of the council. The city of Bareith, is the capital where the Emirs re&s;ide. The wives of the&s;e princes al&s;o enjoy a &s;hare in the go|vernment, and continue to command after their hu&s;|bands' death; but when they have children old enough to &s;ucceed their fathers, they re&s;ign into their hands the reins of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="167">Though the Dru&s;es are con&s;idered as independent on the Grand Signior, they pay annually a &s;mall tri|bute to the Ottoman court; and this is the only &s;ha|dow of authority that the Porte &s;till retains over the&s;e people, jealous of their independance.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a very &s;hort tunic, which &s;carcely reaches to their knees, made of goats hair and wool, and &s;triped with different colours. Over this they tie &s;everal bands of &s;tuff, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of rays, among&s;t which are &s;ome of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue. This kind of ornament, which they wear before and behind, terminates towards the reins: the &s;leeves of their tunic, reach no further than their elbow. Under this upper garment, they have a pretty long robe of Turki&s;h cloth, the &s;leeves of which extend to the wri&s;t: their drawers are of the &s;ame &s;tuff, but much &s;horter and narrower than tho&s;e worn in other parts of the Levant. They u&s;e white &s;hirts, which, in general, are not cut after the Ottoman manner. The girdle with which they bind both the&s;e articles of dre&s;s clo&s;e to the body, pa&s;&s;es above the reins, and is compo&s;ed of ten or twelve pieces of &s;tuff or cloth; and they wrap up their heads in beautiful bands of &s;everal colours, which form their turbans. Their &s;lippers al&s;o differ from tho&s;e of other people in the Ea&s;t, and have &s;ome re&s;emblance to our &s;hoes, ex|cept, that the leather of which they are made is red,
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="168">
<HEAD>DRUSES.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="165" REF="169">
or yellow morocco; that they fa&s;ten the &s;traps with thongs of the &s;ame, in&s;tead of buckles; and that the upper-leather ri&s;es a great way up the leg.</P>
<P>The form and colour of their clothes have &s;uch a conformity, that the Dru&s;es &s;eem all to wear a military uniform: their princes, however, dre&s;s in a different manner, and in a great mea&s;ure copy the Turks. The dre&s;s al&s;o of their prie&s;ts, has no relation with that in common u&s;e; they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by black, brown, and &s;ometimes white clothes; they carry no arms, and their turbans are white and exceedingly high.</P>
<P>One might almo&s;t &s;ay, that the arms of the Dru&s;es form a part of their dre&s;s; for they never lay them a&s;ide either in the time of peace, or of war. They con&s;i&s;t of a pair of pi&s;tols, with a poniard, which they &s;u&s;pend from the fore part of their girdle; an axe, a large flat bottle filled with powder, a fuzee, and a cartouch box, which hangs behind, containing twenty-four rounds of &s;hot. They have very few hor&s;es, becau&s;e they would be of no u&s;e among their moun|tains, in which they keep them&s;elves fortified.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of their women, is much the &s;ame as that of the Turki&s;h women, except that they wear on their heads a plate of &s;ilver, made in the form of a cone,
<PB N="166" REF="170">
and about a palm in breadth. Above it they fix a long veil, which de&s;cends half way down the body, and which &s;eems to add to their beauty and grace. When they have occa&s;ion to go abroad, they cover their face with it.</P>
<P>A thin delicate figure, &s;o much admired in Europe, is not held in the &s;ame e&s;timation by the Dru&s;es. The&s;e rude people prefer tho&s;e of a larger &s;ize; and, as the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing is natural to all the women of the earth; whil&s;t the European ladies endeavour, by vigorous ab&s;tinence, to render their per&s;ons genteel, the female Dru&s;es &s;trive to acquire, by high living, that plump and jolly appearance, which among&s;t them con&s;titutes beauty.</P>
<P>The Mutuales, are a people di&s;per&s;ed in great num|bers all over Syria; and are named thus from <HI>Mutual,</HI> a celebrated captain, who de&s;troyed the ancient religion of the Per&s;ians, in order to &s;ub&s;titute Mahometani&s;m in its &s;tead. The Mutuales, therefore, are Mahome|tans, but &s;chi&s;matics.</P>
<P>They differ from the ancient believers in only one point, which is, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the doctors. Whil&s;t the latter called Sinnins, or Legietes, reckon as im|mediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the prophet, <HI>Abubaker, O&s;man,</HI> and <HI>Omar;</HI> the Mutuales acknowledge none but <HI>Ali.</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="171">
This point was conte&s;ted between both parties, by force of arms; and torrents of blood were &s;hed in the di&s;pute. <HI>Hu&s;&s;an</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein,</HI> brothers and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Ali,</HI> peri&s;hed by the hands of the Sinnins; and <HI>Mutual,</HI> who inhabited their domains, adopted al&s;o their madne&s;s and prejudice. And &s;uch is the blindne&s;s of fanatici&s;m, that the Mutuales think they perform an action agreeable to heaven, when they &s;a|crifice a Sinnin.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sinnins are not the only per&s;ons whom the Mutuales con&s;ider as impure. All religions, without di&s;tinction, appear to them worthy of the &s;ame con|tempt. They mu&s;t be extremely hungry before they can be induced to eat with a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Should an European, by chance put his lips to any of their cups, they immediately break it to pieces, by da&s;hing it on the ground; and, if the va&s;e be of metal, they plunge it &s;everal times into boiling water, invoking the name of God, and that of his pro|phet.</P>
<P>When they purcha&s;e any provi&s;ions in the Chri&s;|tian, or Mahometan markets, they dip them three or four times into the mud, for the purpo&s;e, as they &s;ay, of purifying them.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172">The Mutuales are above the middle &s;tature; have robu&s;t con&s;titutions, and are indefatigable in war. In dre&s;s and manners, they bear a great re&s;emblance to the Arabs.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no country in the world, where the women are held in le&s;s con&s;ideration than among the&s;e people. A Mutuale prie&s;t leads his wife to a friend, as he would lead his hor&s;e; and, when in want of money, he lets her out for a month, or half a year. No di&s;putes, re&s;pecting the children, ever re&s;ult from this traffic; they mu&s;t be maintained by the per&s;on who borrows the woman; becau&s;e, the produce of a field belongs always to him who has &s;own it; and, if any altercation ari&s;es between the parties, they tru&s;t to the hone&s;ty of the woman to &s;ettle them. The Mutuales do not think they offend God by this con|duct: when reproached for it, they reply, that every one has a right to di&s;po&s;e of his property as he plea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Pale&s;tine.</HEAD>
<P>PALESTINE is bounded on the North by Saide, or Sidon; on the South, by the Dead Sea; on the We&s;t, by the Mediterranean; and on the Ea&s;t, by the river Jordan, and the Lake of Tiberias. In length it is about a hundred and &s;eventy miles; but its breadth varies much, being in &s;ome places fifty-eight miles, and in others, only twenty-two.</P>
<P>It comprehends the ancient country of Canaan, conquered by <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the conductor of the people of God, after the death of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> It was called al&s;o the <HI>Promi&s;ed Land,</HI> becau&s;e it had been promi&s;ed by God, many centuries before, to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his de&s;cen|dants.</P>
<P>After the return of the Jews from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, this country was divided into three parts; called Judaea, Samaria, and Galilee. Judaea is the
<PB N="170" REF="174">
mo&s;t Southern part, and Galilee the mo&s;t Northern; on which account, Samaria, called at pre&s;ent the Napulo&s;a, remained in the middle, and was, as it were, the centre of all Pale&s;tine.</P>
<P>It is &s;till con&s;idered to be divided into the &s;ame three parts. The capital of Judaea is Jeru&s;alem; that of Galilee, the &s;mall city of Nazareth; and that of Samaria, the city of Napulo&s;a.</P>
<P>Pale&s;tine, is known al&s;o by The Holy Land, becau&s;e our Saviour was born and re&s;ided here, till the period when he a&s;cended into Heaven. The &s;criptures de|&s;cribe this country as exceedingly fertile, and abound|ing with productions of every kind. In Deuteronomy, it is &s;aid, "For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that &s;pring out of the valleys and hills." And in another place, to &s;hew its richne&s;s and fertility, it is &s;aid to be, "A land flowing with milk and honey."</P>
<P>The great population of Pale&s;tine, is an evident proof of the fertility of its &s;oil. In the time of <HI>David,</HI> there were eleven hundred thou&s;and combatants in the kingdom of I&s;rael; and four hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and in the tribe of Judah alone. Some writers conclude, therefore, that its inhabitants, including
<PB N="171" REF="175">
women and children, might amount in all to eight millions of people.</P>
<P>The land of Canaan, contained a prodigious number of cities and villages, as may be &s;een in the fifteenth chapter of <HI>Jo&s;hua;</HI> where we are told, that a hundred and twelve walled cities fell to the lot of the tribe of Judah alone. Of all its ancient cities, however, a few only remain; the re&s;t being either de&s;troyed, or their names given to paltry villages, now almo&s;t in ruins.</P>
<P>The population of this country, is al&s;o greatly di|mini&s;hed; but, at pre&s;ent, no certain calculation can be given of it; as the number of its inhabitants con|tinually varies, on account of the Bedouin Arabs, who always come here at certain periods.</P>
<P>If the country has lo&s;t its ancient &s;plendor, by the de&s;truction of its cities, and the decrea&s;e of its popu|lation, it &s;till retains its natural advantages, being beautifully variegated with mountains, hills, and de|lightful plains.</P>
<P>Its climate is exceeding good. It &s;eldom rains here; but this deficiency is &s;upplied by mo&s;t abun|dant dews. The cold is never exce&s;&s;ive; and, if the &s;ummer heats are great, they are mitigated
<PB N="172" REF="176">
by a periodical breeze, which renders them &s;up|portable.</P>
<P>Pale&s;tine abounds with almo&s;t every thing that is u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary for the life of man. It produces wheat, barley, pul&s;e of all kinds, fruits, wine, and oil, in &s;uch plenty; that though a part only of the coun|try is cultivated, great quantities of the&s;e articles are di&s;tributed in the neighbouring provinces of Syria, and even tran&s;ported to Europe, particularly wheat, barley, and pul&s;e.</P>
<P>With regard to dome&s;tic and wild animals, it pro|duces various kinds, many of which are not known in Europe. Cotton grows here in great perfection, particularly in Samaria and Galilee. Among its pro|ductions, may be reckoned al&s;o &s;ilk, tobacco, drugs, and aromatic herbs.</P>
<P>The mountainous country towards Jeru&s;alem, is more barren than any other part, but there is no rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it has always been in the &s;ame con|dition. The cau&s;e of its being at pre&s;ent neglected, is the want of population; the inhabitants having abandoned the mountains, and retired to the plains, where agriculture is attended with le&s;s labour, and where they find more conveniences for their cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="177">Even in Galilee and Samaria, there are many parts &s;till uncultivated; but as they abound with gra&s;s, they afford pa&s;ture to the cattle, which form the whole riches of the Arabs.</P>
<P>This province, according to &s;ome writers, is a di&s;|trict independant of every pachalie. Sometimes it has governors of its own, who re&s;ide either at Gaza or Jeru&s;alem; but at pre&s;ent, Jeru&s;alem is &s;ubordinate to the Pacha of Dama&s;cus, who appoints a deputy called a Mot&s;allam; and the re&s;t of the province is divided into three apanages, <HI>viz.</HI> Yafa, Loudd, and Gaza. The former has been given to the Sultana mother, and the two latter to the Captain Pacha, as a recompence for pa&s;t &s;ervices. The&s;e three di&s;tricts have, therefore, now &s;eparate governors. We &s;hall fir&s;t, however, treat of the ancient capital of the pro|vince, Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>The approach to this city, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> pre&s;ents a &s;triking example of the vici&s;&s;itude of human affairs. When we behold its walls levelled, its ditches filled up, and all its buildings embarra&s;&s;ed with ruins; we &s;carcely can believe we view that celebrated metro|polis, which formerly with&s;tood the efforts of the mo&s;t powerful empires. Still more are we a&s;toni&s;hed at its ancient greatne&s;s, when we con&s;ider its &s;itua|tion, amid a rugged &s;oil, de&s;titute of water, and &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="174" REF="178">
by dry channels of torrents and &s;teep heights. Remote from every great road, it &s;eems neither to have been calculated for a con&s;iderable mart of com|merce, nor the center of a great con&s;umption. It overcame, however, every ob&s;tacle, and may be ad|duced as a proof what popular opinions may effect in the hands of an able legi&s;lature, or when favoured by happy circum&s;tances. The &s;ame opinions &s;till pre|&s;erve to this city its feeble exi&s;tence. The renown of its miracles perpetuated in the Ea&s;t, invites and re|tains a certain number of inhabitants within its walls. Mahometans, Chri&s;tians, and Jews, without di&s;tinction of &s;ects, all make it a point of honour to &s;ee, or to have &s;een, what they denominated the <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>holy city.</HI> To judge from the re&s;pect the inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;s, for the &s;acred places it contains, we &s;hould be ready to imagine there is not in the world a more devout people; but this has not prevented them from acquiring, and well de&s;erving, the reputation of the vile&s;t people of Syria; not excepting even tho&s;e of Dama&s;cus. Their number is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to twelve or fourteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>This city is, at pre&s;ent, about three miles in cir|cumference; its &s;ituation is different from what it was at the time of our Saviour. Mount Calvary, upon which is built the church of the Holy Sepul|chre, &s;tood formerly without the walls; being appro|priated

to the execution of malefactors, and, of cour&s;e, con&s;idered as a polluted &s;pot; but &s;ince our Saviour's &s;uffering upon this mount, it has been &s;o reverenced, and re&s;orted to by Chri&s;tians, as to have drawn the city round about it; and is, at pre&s;ent, the center of Jeru&s;alem. On the contrary, a great part of Mount Sion now &s;tands without the walls.</P>
<P>The church of the Holy Sepulchre, is the mo&s;t magnificent, and the only remarkable building in Je|ru&s;alem, and that which pilgrims chiefly come to vi&s;it. It is a large &s;tructure, with a round nave, having no light but what comes through the top, like the ro|tunda at Rome. The dome is covered on the out|&s;ide with lead, and within with cedar-wood. The opening of the dome is clo&s;ed with a net of wire, to prevent birds from flying into the church. In the middle of the nave, and directly under the opening of the dome, is the Holy Sepulchre, which is in a chapel, who&s;e door is three feet high, and two broad. It is &s;o &s;mall, that it will hold but three per&s;ons on their knees at a time. On the right-hand, at the en|trance, is the place where the body of our Saviour was laid. The table he was laid on, is two feet and a half high, from the pavement; and is covered with white marble, as the pilgrims who came to vi&s;it the tomb, were continually carrying away &s;mall pieces of the &s;tone.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181">This chapel is cut out of the rock; and there three holes in the roof, to let out the &s;moke of the lamps, which are forty-four in number, and always kept lighted. Before the gate of the &s;epulchre, is a &s;ilver lamp, &s;o large, that two men cannot fathom it. The Turks have had a mind &s;everal times, to carry off this lamp, and &s;end it to Mecca.</P>
<P>If any one be de&s;irous to know how a per&s;on feels him&s;elf, the fir&s;t time he kneels before the Sepulchre of our Lord, for my own part, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> I can only an&s;wer, that I never felt my&s;elf &s;o much affected in my life. A Monk, who vi&s;ited the &s;acred tomb with me, and who had never before been at Jeru|&s;alem, was &s;o agitated, and &s;hed &s;o many tears, on kneeling before the &s;epulchre of our Lord, that it was full two hours before he could be brought to him|&s;elf again. I will not, from thence conclude, &s;ays the above writer, that this was indi&s;putably the &s;epul|chre of our Saviour. But as no &s;erious per&s;on can approach this &s;pot, without being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an idea, and meditating upon the &s;ufferings of him who died for the &s;ins of mankind, his &s;oul mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very deeply affected. And though we live in an age, in which &s;uch numbers &s;eem to glory in their infidelity, conceiving this to be a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing characteri&s;tic from the vulgar, and the criterion of a fine genius; yet I am firmly of opinion, the mo&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="182">
profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;t, with all his affected &s;tupidity, could not forbear feeling the &s;ame emotions with my&s;elf upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On Good-Friday, the pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour is &s;olemnized in this church. All the mo&s;t material cir|cum&s;tances of this great event are then repre&s;ented; &s;uch as nailing him to the cro&s;s, crowning him with thorns, and then taking the body down, and wrapping it in a &s;heet. The Monks have fir&s;t a &s;ermon, and then every one takes a lighted taper in his hand, with crucifixes, and other uten&s;ils to begin the proce&s;&s;ion. One of the&s;e crucifixes is as big as life, exceedingly well done, and is crowned with thorns, and be&s;meared with blood. They vi&s;it fir&s;t the pillar of flagellation; next the pri&s;on; afterwards the altar of the divi&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s garments; then they advance to the chapel of deri&s;ion, and from thence to Mount Calvary, leav|ing their &s;hoes at the bottom of the &s;tairs. Here are two altars; one where our Saviour was &s;uppo&s;ed to be nailed on the cro&s;s, and another where it was erected, and where they &s;et up the crucified image. Near this &s;pot, is the memorable cleft in the rock, which was &s;aid to have been made by an earthquake, when our Saviour &s;uffered.</P>
<P>There are &s;even gates to this city; one of which, called the Golden gate, has been long blocked up by
<PB N="178" REF="183">
the Turks; from a prediction, that the Chri&s;tians will again enter Jeru&s;alem by this gate, and get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city. The Turks u&s;e &s;till farther precaution, in &s;hutting every Friday, during their time of prayer, all the other gates; it having been further predicted, that the Chri&s;tians would enter Jeru&s;alem on the Turki&s;h &s;abbath, and during the time of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A great number of Jews repair to this city, as they grow old, in order to end their days here, and be in|terred in the valley of Jeho&s;aphat. It being a received notion among them, that tho&s;e who are buried in this vale, will appear fir&s;t at the great day of judgment, which they &s;uppo&s;e will take place on this &s;pot.</P>
<P>As for the mo&s;que in this city, which the Turks affirm to have been the temple of Solomon, no Chri&s;|tian is permitted to enter it; &s;o very rigid are they in this re&s;pect, that &s;hould any Chri&s;tian be even &s;een in the court that &s;urrounds the mo&s;que, he mu&s;t either turn Mahometan, or be burnt alive.</P>
<P>When the pilgrims arrive near the gates of Jeru|&s;alem, the fathers of the Latin convent &s;end their interpreter, to invite them to their cloy&s;ters, where they are hand&s;omely entertained, their feet wa&s;hed, and an apartment a&s;&s;igned them; after which they give each pilgrim a wax torch, and go in proce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="179" REF="184">
round the cloi&s;ters, &s;inging <HI>Te Deum,</HI> for their &s;afe ar|rival in the Holy city.</P>
<P>Every pilgrim pays the governor an entrance fee of ten pia&s;tres; he likewi&s;e collects a con&s;iderable re|venue from the exportation of certain &s;ingular ar|ticles from Jeru&s;alem, &s;uch as <HI>beads, relics, &s;anctuaries, cro&s;&s;es, pa&s;&s;ions, agnus dei's, &s;capularies,</HI> &amp;c. of which near three hundred che&s;ts are &s;ent off annually. The fabrication of the&s;e uten&s;ils of piety, procures &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence for the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian and Ma|hometan families of Jeru&s;alem, and its neighbour|hood; men, women, and children are employed in carving, and turning wood and coral, and in embroi|dering in &s;ilk, with pearls, and gold and &s;ilver thread. The convent of the Holy-land alone, lays out an|nually, to the amount of fifty thou&s;and pia&s;tres in the&s;e wares; and tho&s;e of the Greeks, Armenians, and Copts, taken together, pay a &s;till larger &s;um. This &s;ort of commerce is the more profitable to the manufac|turers, is their goods co&s;t them little, and their price is enhanced by &s;uper&s;tition. The&s;e commodities ex|ported to Greece, Italy, and Portugal, and particu|larly to Spain, produce very con&s;iderable returns, either in the form of alms, or of payments. To this the convents join another not le&s;s important article of traffic, the vi&s;its of the pilgrims. There was a time when the mini&s;ters of religion taught, that it was indi&s;pen|&s;ibly
<PB N="180" REF="185">
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; and this pious zeal per|vading all Europe, gave ri&s;e to the Cru&s;ades. Since their unfortunate i&s;&s;ue, the zeal of the European pil|grims has dimini&s;hed, and is now reduced to a few Italian, Spani&s;h, and German monks; but the ca&s;e is different with the Orientals. Faithful to the &s;pirit of pa&s;t times, they continued to con&s;ider the journey to Jeru&s;alem, as a work of the greate&s;t merit. Their prie&s;ts and monks, who find their advantage in this fervor, &s;tudy to promote it. The Greeks e&s;pecially, declare, that the pilgrimage confers plenary indulgence, not only for the pa&s;t but for the future; and that it not only ab&s;olves from the neglect of fa&s;ting, and the non-ob|&s;ervance of fe&s;tivals, but even from the mo&s;t heinous offences. Such great encouragements are not with|out effect; and every year, a crowd of pilgrims of both &s;exes, and all ages, &s;et out from the Morea, Ar|chipelago, Con&s;tantinople, Natolia, Armenia, Syria, and Egypt, the number of whom, in 1784, amounted to two thou&s;and. The monks, who find by their re|gi&s;ter, that formerly ten or twelve thou&s;and annually made this pilgrimage, never cea&s;e exclaiming, that religion rapidly decays, and that the zeal of the faith|ful is nearly extingui&s;hed. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that this zeal is rather expen&s;ive, &s;ince the mo&s;t moderate pilgrimage never co&s;ts le&s;s than near two hundred pounds, and from that &s;um to between two and three thou&s;and.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="186">The&s;e pilgrims, as we have already ob&s;erved, di&s;|embark at Yafa. They arrive in November, and re|pair without delay to Jeru&s;alem, where they remain until after the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter. They are lodged confu&s;edly, by whole families, in the cells of the con|vents of their re&s;pective communions. On Palm-Sunday, they go to purify them&s;elves in the Jordan. The reader mu&s;t con&s;ult particular relations of this pilgrimage, to form an idea of the tumultuous march of this fanatic multitude into the plain of Jericho; the indecent and &s;uper&s;titious zeal with which they throw them&s;elves, men, women, and children, naked into the Jordan; the fatigue they undergo before they reach the borders of the Dead Sea; the melancholy in&s;pired by the &s;ight of the gloomy rocks of that country, the mo&s;t &s;avage in nature; their return and vi&s;itation of the holy places; and the ceremony of the new fire, which de&s;cends from heaven on the holy Saturday, brought by an angel. The Orientals &s;till believe in this miracle, though the Franks acknowledge that the prie&s;ts retire from the &s;acri&s;ty, and effect what is done by very natural means.</P>
<P>Ea&s;ter over, each returns to his own country, proud of being able to rival the Mahometan in the title o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pilgrim; nay, many of them, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves as &s;uch, imprint on their hands, wri&s;ts, or arms, figures of the cro&s;s or &s;phere, with the cypher of
<PB N="182" REF="187">
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI> This painful, and &s;ometimes dan|gerous operation, is performed with needles, and the perforations filled with gunpowder, or powder of antimony, and is never to be effaced. The Maho|metans have the &s;ame practice, which is al&s;o to be found among the Indians, and other &s;avages, (called at Otahcit&eacute; <HI>Tattooing</HI>) as it was likewi&s;e among &s;everal ancient nations, with whom it had a connection with religion, which it &s;till retains wherever it prevails. So much devotion does not, however, exempt the&s;e pilgrims from the proverbial cen&s;ure thrown upon the Hadjis; &s;ince, the Chri&s;tians &s;ay likewi&s;e, <HI>beware of the pilgrims of Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>We may well &s;uppo&s;e &s;o great a multitude, re&s;iding at Jeru&s;alem for five or &s;ix months, mu&s;t leave behind them con&s;iderable &s;ums; and reckoning only fifteen hundred per&s;ons, at one hundred pi&s;toles each, we &s;hall find they cannot expend le&s;s than between &s;ixty and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds. Part of this money is paid to the inhabitants and merchants for nece&s;&s;aries, and the&s;e omit no opportunity of impo&s;ing upon &s;tran|gers. Water, in 1784, co&s;t ten-pence a jug. Ano|ther part goes to the governor and his &s;ubalterns, and the remainder is the profit of the convents.</P>
<P>Of the places round Jeru&s;alem, there are only two which merit attention. The fir&s;t is <HI>Raha,</HI> the ancient
<PB N="183" REF="188">
Jericho; &s;ituated &s;ix leagues to the North-ea&s;t of Je|ru&s;alem, in a plain &s;ix or &s;even leagues long, by three wide; around which are a number of barren moun|tains that render it extremely hot. Here, formerly, was cultivated the balm of Mecca. At pre&s;ent there is not a plant of it remaining; but another &s;pecies is to be found at Raha, called Zakkown, celebrated al&s;o for healing wounds, and which the Arabs &s;ell very dear: this is the &s;ole commerce of Raha, which is no more than a ruinous village. It was on the &s;ummit of one of the mountains &s;urrounding this plain, that the devil took our Saviour, when he &s;hewed him all the kingdoms of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Bait-ell-ham,</HI> or Bethlehem, &s;o ce|lebrated in the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;tianity. This village, &s;ituated two leagues South-ea&s;t of Jeru&s;alem, is &s;eated on an eminence, in a country full of hills and vallies, and might be rendered very agreeable. The &s;oil is the be&s;t in all the&s;e di&s;tricts; but, as is the ca&s;e every where el&s;e, cultivation is wanting. Near Bethlehem is a valley, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed the angels appeared to the &s;hepherds, and proclaimed the birth of Chri&s;t. The fountains, pools, and gardens, which were &s;aid to have been the delight of <HI>Solomon,</HI> are al&s;o &s;till re|maining. They reckon, about &s;ix hundred men ca|pable of bearing arms upon occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189">In this neighbourhood are &s;ome &s;oap manufactories, and a very ancient gla&s;s-hou&s;e, the only one in Syria. They make there a great quantity of coloured rings, bracelets for the wri&s;ts and legs, and for the arms above the elbows; be&s;ides a variety of other trinkets which are &s;ent even to Con&s;tantinople. The rings are often more than an inch in diameter; they are pa&s;&s;ed on the arms of children; and it often, happens, that the arm growing bigger than the ring, a ridge, of fle&s;h is formed above and below, &s;o that the ring is buried in a deep hollow, and cannot be got off, and this is con&s;idered as a beauty.</P>
<P>Gaza, which was the occa&s;ional re&s;idence of the pacha, and is now that of the Aga, is no more than a defencele&s;s village, peopled at mo&s;t by two thou&s;and inhabitants. The &s;ituation of Gaza, by fitting it for the medium of communication between Syria and Egypt, has rendered it at all times a town of &s;ome importance. The ruins of white marble, &s;ometimes found there, prove it was formerly the abode of luxury and opulence. The black &s;oil of the &s;urrounding country is extremely fertile; and the gardens, watered by the limpid &s;treams, produce, without art, pomegra|nates, oranges, exqui&s;ite dates, and ranunculus roots, in great reque&s;t even at Con&s;tantinople. It has, how|ever, &s;hared in the general de&s;truction; and, notwith|&s;tanding its proud title of the capital of Pale&s;tine, &s;ays
<PB N="185" REF="190">
<HI>Volney,</HI> who includes Jeru&s;alem, in the province of Syria, it is now a town of &s;mall account.</P>
<P>The manufacture of cottons, is the principal &s;upport of the inhabitants, who keep about five hundred looms employed. There are al&s;o two or three &s;oap manu|factories. The article of a&s;hes, was formerly a con|&s;iderable commerce. The Bedouins, who procured the&s;e a&s;hes, by &s;imply burning the plants of the de|&s;art, &s;old them at a rea&s;onable price; but &s;ince the Aga has monopolized this commodity, the Arabs, compelled to part with it at his price, are no longer anxious to collect it; and the inhabitants, con&s;trained to purcha&s;e at his plea&s;ure, neglect making &s;oap.</P>
<P>A branch of commerce, &s;till more advantageous to the people of Gaza, is furni&s;hing provi&s;ions for the caravans, which pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s between Syria and Egypt. They al&s;o purcha&s;e the plunder from the Bedouins, an article which would be of prodigious wealth to them, were the&s;e accidents more frequent. It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the profits they made by the plunder of the great caravan in 1757. Two thirds of upwards of twenty thou&s;and camel loads, of which the caravan of pilgrims was compo&s;ed, were brought to Gaza. The ignorant and fami&s;hed Be|douins, who knew no value in the fine&s;t &s;tuffs, but as they &s;erved to cover them, &s;old the fine Cachmire
<PB N="186" REF="191">
&s;hawls, callicoes, mu&s;lins, Per&s;ian &s;ilks, coffee, and gums, for a few pia&s;tres. We may judge, from the following &s;tory, of the ignorance and &s;implicity of the&s;e inhabitants of the de&s;erts. A Bedouin of Anaza, having found among the booty, &s;everal bags of fine pearls, took them for rice, and had them boiled to eat them; but &s;eeing that they did not &s;often, was on the point of throwing them away, when an in|habitant of Gaza gave him in exchange for them, a red bonnet of Faz. A &s;imilar accident happened at the time of the pillage of the caravan in 1779; and in 1784, the caravan of Barbary, con&s;i&s;ting of up|wards of three thou&s;and camels, was likewi&s;e pillaged, and the quantity of coffee di&s;per&s;ed by the Bedouins throughout Pale&s;tine was &s;o great, as to cau&s;e the price of that article to fall &s;uddenly to one half of what it was before; and it would have fallen &s;till more, had not the governor prohibited the &s;ale of it, in order to compel the Bedouins to deliver it all into his hands. A monopoly of this &s;ort, in the affair of 1779, produced him more than eighty thou&s;and pia&s;tres.</P>
<P>In the de&s;arts of this province, are the two moun|tains Sinai and Horeb, &s;o frequently mentioned in the &s;criptures. At the foot of the former, is a con|vent of Monks. The Greeks have &s;o much faith in the relics of St. <HI>Catharine,</HI> which they &s;ay is depo&s;ited
<PB N="187" REF="192">
there, that they doubt of their &s;alvation, if they have not vi&s;ited them at lea&s;t once in their lives. They repair thither even as far as from the Morea, and Con&s;tantinople. The rendezvous is at Cairo, where the Monks of Mount Sinai have corre&s;pondents, who treat with the Arabs for a convoy. The ordinary price is &s;ix pounds two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence each pa&s;&s;enger, exclu&s;ive of provi&s;ions. On their arrival at the convent, the Greeks perform their devotions, vi&s;it the church, ki&s;s the relics and images, mount on their knees more than one hundred &s;teps of the hill of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and conclude by making an offering, the value of which is not fixed, but rarely amounts to fifty pataques.</P>
<P>Except at the&s;e vi&s;itations, which take place once a year, this convent is the mo&s;t de&s;art and &s;avage abode in nature. The adjacent country is nothing but a pile of rugged and naked rocks. Mount Sinai, at the foot of which it is &s;eated, is a peak of granite, which &s;eems to overwhelm it. The hou&s;e is a &s;ort of &s;quare pri&s;on, who&s;e lo&s;ty walls have only a window, which, though very high, &s;erves likewi&s;e by way of door; for to enter this convent, the traveller mu&s;t go into a ba&s;ket, which the Monks leave &s;u&s;pended at the window, and occa&s;ionally hoi&s;t up with ropes. This precaution ari&s;es from their fear of the Arabs, who might force the convent, if the u&s;ual entrance
<PB N="188" REF="193">
was by a door: they never open the only one there is, except on a vi&s;it from the bi&s;hop; at all other times it is kept clo&s;ely &s;hut. This vi&s;itation &s;hould take place every two or three years; but as it nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a con&s;iderable contribution from the Arabs, the Monks evade it. They do not, however, &s;o ea&s;ily e&s;cape the daily di&s;tribution of a certain quan|tity of provi&s;ions; and the quarrels which ari&s;e on this &s;ubject, frequently draw on them a &s;hower of &s;tones, and even mu&s;ket-&s;hot from the di&s;contented Bedouins. They never &s;tir into the country; they have by dint of labour, made a garden on the rocks, with earth they have brought thither, which &s;erves them to walk in. They cultivate excellent fruit there, &s;uch as grapes, figs, and e&s;pecially pears, of which they make pre&s;ents; and which are highly e&s;teemed at Cairo, no &s;uch fruit being there to be met with. Their dome&s;tic life is the &s;ame with that of the Greeks and Maronites of Lebanon; that is, it is entirely de|voted to u&s;eful works, or to religious duties. But the Monks of Lebanon enjoy the ine&s;timable advan|tage of liberty and &s;ecurity, which is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e of Sinai. In other re&s;pects, this confined and melancholy &s;tate of exi&s;tence is, that of all the Monks in the country of the Turks. Every where their con|vents are pri&s;ons, with no other light than a window, by which they receive their victuals; and every where are they built in di&s;mal places, de&s;titute of
<PB N="189" REF="194">
whatever can give plea&s;ure, and where nothing is to be found but rocks and &s;tones, without either gra&s;s or mo&s;s, and yet they are full of Monks. There are fifty at Mount Sinai, five and twenty at Mar Saba, and upwards of three hundred in the two de&s;arts of Egypt. I, one day, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> enquired the rea&s;on of this, in a conver&s;ation with one of the &s;uperiors, and a&s;ked him, "What could induce men to engage in a mode of life &s;o truly mi&s;erable?" "What," &s;ays he, "are not you a Chri&s;tian?" Is not this the path which leads to heaven?&mdash;"But," replied I, "we may al&s;o re|ceive &s;alvation without renouncing the world; (and between our&s;elves, father), I do not perceive that the Monks, though they are pious, po&s;&s;e&s;s that ancient fervour, which, throughout life, kept its eyes fixed on the hour of death!" "It is true," &s;aid he, "we have no longer the au&s;terity of the ancient Anchorites; and, in reality, this is one rea&s;on why our convents are &s;o full. You, who come from a country where men live in &s;ecurity and abundance, may con&s;ider our life as an in&s;upportable denial, and our retreat from the world as a &s;acrifice. But in the &s;ituation of this country, perhaps, the ca&s;e is different. What can we do? Turn merchants! We &s;hould then be overwhelmed with the cares of bu&s;ine&s;s and our fa|milies; and after having worked hard for thirty years, comes the aga, the pacha, or the cadi; we are brought to trial without the &s;hadow of a crime; witne&s;&s;es are
<PB N="190" REF="195">
&s;uborned to accu&s;e us; we are ba&s;tinadoed, plundered, and turned into the world as naked as the fir&s;t day we entered it. As for the pea&s;ant, his ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e; the aga oppre&s;&s;es him, the &s;oldier pillages him, and the Arabs rob him. Shall we become &s;oldiers? The profe&s;&s;ion is laborious and dangerous, and how it will end is not very certain. It may &s;eem hard, perhaps, to &s;hut our&s;elves up in a convent; but, at lea&s;t, we live there in peace; and, though in a &s;tate of habitual ab&s;tinence and poverty, we perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy more than we &s;hould, if we had continued in the world. Ob&s;erve the &s;ituation of the pea&s;ants, and look at ours. We po&s;&s;e&s;s every thing they have, and even what they have not; we are better clad, and better fed; we drink wine and coffee: and who are our Monks but the children of pea&s;ants?</P>

<P><PB N="191" REF="197">Yafa, the ancient Joppa, &s;ituated in this province where the pilgrims di&s;embark. As a &s;ea-port and a place of &s;trength, Yafa is nothing; but it is capable of becoming one of the mo&s;t important on the coa&s;t, on account of two &s;prings of fre&s;h water which are within its walls, on the &s;ea &s;hore. It is held by ano|ther aga, who pays for it one hundred and twenty pur&s;es to the Sultana. For this he receives the whole miri, and poll-tax of the town, with &s;ome adjacent villages; but the chief part of his revenue ari&s;es from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, as he receives all the duties on im|ports and exports. The&s;e are pretty con&s;iderable, as it is at Yafa that the rice of Damietta is landed for Jeru&s;alem, and the merchandize of a &s;mall French factory at Ramla. It is the port likewi&s;e, for the pilgrims of the Morea and Con&s;tantinople; each of whom pay him fourteen crowns on his landing, and the &s;ame &s;um when he returns. The convent in this city, is &s;aid to be built on the &s;pot, where &s;tood the hou&s;e of <HI>Simon</HI> the tanner, mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. It was there where St. <HI>Peter</HI> lodged, when he rai&s;ed <HI>Tabitha</HI> from the dead; and where he &s;aw a ve&s;&s;el let down from heaven, that was full of un|clean bea&s;ts. It was here likewi&s;e, that <HI>Jonah</HI> took &s;hipping to fly from the pre&s;ence of God, when he commanded him to preach repentance to the Nine|vites. This place has al&s;o been rendered famous in the fables of antiquity; it being handed down to us,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
that here <HI>Andromeda</HI> was fa&s;tened to a rock, in order to be devoured by the &s;ea-mon&s;ters, from which &s;he was delivered by <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> who had fallen in love with her.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the Ea&s;t of Yafa, is the village of Loudd, where the other aga re&s;ides. A place lately ravaged by fire and &s;word, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> would have preci&s;ely the appearance of this village. From the huts of the inhabitants, to the palace of the aga, is one continued heap of rubbi&s;h and ruins. The poor Chri&s;tians who dwell here, &s;hew with great veneration the ruins of the church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and make &s;tran|gers &s;it on a column; which, as they &s;ay, that Saint once re&s;ted on. They point out the place where he preached, where he prayed, &amp;c. The whole country is full of &s;uch traditions. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tir a &s;tep without being &s;hewn the traces of &s;ome apo&s;tle, &s;ome martyr, or &s;ome virgin; but what credit can be due to the&s;e traditions?</P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants of Pa|le&s;tine, differ little from tho&s;e of Syria. The women in the villages, are not &s;o &s;trict in covering them|&s;elves with a veil when they go abroad, as they are in other parts of A&s;ia. That &s;implicity of life which pre|vailed among the patriarchs, is a good deal more pre|&s;erved
<PB N="193" REF="199">
among&s;t the country people in this province, than in Syria.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was in one of the villages of this pro|vince, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> a young Arab woman, at who&s;e wedding I had been pre&s;ent a day or two before, came to the well to draw water. She was accompanied by &s;ome other women, who were &s;inging a &s;ong allu&s;ive to her marriage; and who, every now and then, &s;ent forth certain tremulous &s;ounds, which had no mean|ing, but were only expre&s;&s;ions of joy.</P>
<P>At a di&s;tance, appeared &s;everal men, who every now and then di&s;charged mu&s;kets and pi&s;tols, in compli|ment to the new married hu&s;band, who was on hor&s;e|back; and who, in&s;tead of following his wife, pro|ceeded with his company to a different quarter.</P>
<P>His wife, who was a beautiful young woman, was dre&s;&s;ed in a robe with very long &s;leeves, which hung down to the ground; and which, as well as the re&s;t of the robe, were &s;triped with various lively colours. This was the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of a new married per&s;on. When &s;he arrived at the well, &s;he filled her ve&s;&s;el, after which the re&s;t of the women did the &s;ame. This cu&s;tom, of women going to draw water, for the u&s;e of their families, is often mentioned in the &s;crip|tures. We are told in Gene&s;is, that when the &s;ervant
<PB N="194" REF="200">
of <HI>Abraham</HI> was going to Me&s;opotamia, to &s;eek a wife for <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> he made his camels kneel down, without the city of Nahor, by a well, at the time of the even|ing, when the women went out to draw water.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els which the women of Pale&s;tine u&s;e for drawing water, are a kind of narrow mouthed pit|chers, with two handles, capable of containing be|tween five and &s;ix quarts.</P>
<P>When the women go to a &s;tream with the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, they fill them by dipping them into it; but, if they go to a well, which may happen to be deep, they carry with them a leathern bag, folded up under their arm, with which they draw up the water.</P>
<P>When they have filled their pitchers, they put them upon their head, placing a handkerchief, folded up in the form of a knot, below them; and, &s;o dexterous are they in carrying the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, that &s;ome of them to &s;hew their &s;kill, hold them in an inclined po&s;ition, and at the &s;ame time employ them&s;elves in &s;pinning, or lead their children along with them by the hand.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> A Review of the Pre&s;ent State of Syria and Egypt, with occa&s;ional Remarks on the Turki&s;h Empire in general.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With re&s;pect to the Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turki&s;h government in Syria, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is pure military de&s;poti&s;m. That is, the bulk of the inhabitants are &s;ubject to the caprices of a faction of armed men, who di&s;po&s;e of every thing according to their intere&s;t, or fancy. To form a proper concep|tion of the &s;pirit with which this faction governs, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the title by which the Turks claim po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country.</P>
<P>When the Ottomans, under Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> took Syria from the Mamlukes, they con&s;idered it as a po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion acquired by the law of arms and war. Now, according to this law, among barbarous nations, the vanqui&s;hed is wholly at the di&s;cretion of the victor, and becomes his &s;lave; his life and property belong
<PB N="196" REF="202">
to his conqueror, who may di&s;po&s;e of every thing; and what he leaves his captive, he leaves him as a fa|vour.</P>
<P>Such was the law among the Greeks and Romans, and among all tho&s;e &s;ocieties of robbers, whom we have honoured with the name of conquerors. Such, at all times, was that of the Tartars, from whom the Turks derive their origin. In the plains of Tartary, the hordes divided by intere&s;t, were no other than bands of robbers, armed for attack and defence; and, to &s;eize as fair booty whatever they might covet. Now in an army, laws are but the orders of the chief; the&s;e orders are ab&s;olute, and &s;uffer no delay; they mu&s;t proceed from one will, and from a &s;ingle head: hence, a &s;upreme authority in him who commands, and a pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in him who obeys. But, in the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e orders, as the in&s;trument in his turn becomes an agent; the con&s;equence of this is, that there is a &s;pirit at once imperious and &s;ervile, which is preci&s;ely that of the Turki&s;h conquerors, Proud after victory, the meane&s;t of the Ottomans treated the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the vanqui&s;hed, with the lofty &s;uperiority of a ma&s;ter; and this &s;pirit diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through every rank, we may judge of the di&s;|tance, from whence the &s;upreme chief looks down upon the crowd of &s;laves beneath him. The&s;e &s;en|timents cannot be better pourtrayed, than in the for|mulary
<PB N="197" REF="203">
of the titles a&s;&s;umed in their public acts; "I, &s;ays the Sultan, in their treaties, who am, by the in|finite grace of the great and omnipotent Creator, em|peror of emperors; a refuge for &s;overeigns, di&s;tribu|tor of crowns to the kings of the earth, &s;ervant of the two thrice-&s;acred cities Mecca and Medina, governor of the holy city of Jeru&s;alem, ma&s;ter of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa; lord of the two &s;eas, of Dama&s;cus, the odour of Paradi&s;e; of Bagdad, the &s;eat of the ca|lifs; and of a multitude of countries, i&s;lands, &s;traits, nations, generations, and of &s;o many victorious armies, which repo&s;e beneath the &s;hade of our Sublime Porte; I, in &s;hort, <HI>the &s;hadow of God</HI> on earth, &amp;c."</P>
<P>From &s;uch exalted grandeur, how mu&s;t the Sultan look down on the re&s;t of mankind? In what light mu&s;t he view that earth he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and di&s;tributes as a domain, of which he is the &s;overeign ma&s;ter? What mu&s;t the people he has &s;ubdued appear, but &s;laves devoted to his &s;ervice? This empire may be compared to a plantation in one of our &s;ugar i&s;lands; where a multitude of &s;laves labour, to &s;upply the luxury of one great proprietor, under the in&s;pection of a few &s;ervants, who take good care of them&s;elves. There is no difference, except that the dominions of the Sultan being too va&s;t for a &s;ingle admini&s;tration, he is obliged to divide it into &s;maller plantations, and &s;eparate governments, admini&s;tered after the &s;ame
<PB N="198" REF="204">
manner as the united empire. Such are the provin|ces under the government of the pachas. The&s;e pro|vinces again being too exten&s;ive, the pachas have had recour&s;e to further &s;ubdivi&s;ions; and hence, that &s;eries of &s;ubalterns, which &s;tep by &s;tep de&s;cends to the lowe&s;t employments. Thus power, being ab&s;olute and arbitrary, in the monarch, is tran&s;mitted ab&s;olute and arbitrary to all his &s;ub-delegates. It is &s;till the Su|tan who dictates, and commands, under the varied names of <HI>Pacha, Moi&s;allam, Kaiem-Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am,</HI> and <HI>Aga;</HI> nor is there one in this de&s;cending &s;cale, even to the <HI>Deliba&s;he,</HI> who does not repre&s;ent, him. It is curious to hear, with what in&s;olence the lowe&s;t of the&s;e &s;ol|diers, giving his orders in a village, pronounces: It is the will <HI>of the Sultan,</HI> it is the Sultan's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In each government, the pacha being the image of the &s;ultan, is like him, an ab&s;olute de&s;pot, The main object of &s;o much authority is to collect the tribute. This duty fulfilled, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> no other is required of him; the means, are at his di&s;cretion; and &s;uch is the nature of his &s;ituation, that he cannot be delicate in his choice of them; for the place he holds, depends on the favour of the Vi&s;ir, or &s;ome other great officer; and this can be only obtained and &s;ecured, by bidding higher than his competitors. He mu&s;t, therefore, rai&s;e money to pay the tribute, and indemnify him|&s;elf for all he has paid, &s;upport his dignity, and make
<PB N="199" REF="205">
provi&s;ion in ca&s;e of accident. The e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of collecting the <HI>miri</HI> (land-tax) and the cu&s;toms, is to appoint one or more principal farmers, for the cur|rent year; who, in order to facilitate the collection, divide it into le&s;&s;er farms, which are again &s;ubdivided, even to the &s;malle&s;t villages. The pacha lets the&s;e employments to the be&s;t bidder. The farmers, who, on their &s;ide, have no object in taking them but gain, &s;train every nerve to augment their receipt. Hence, tho&s;e extortions to which they are the more ea&s;ily in|clined, as they are &s;ure of being &s;upported by au|thority. The con&s;equence is, that the people being denied the fruit of their labour, re&s;train their indu&s;|try to the &s;upply of their nece&s;&s;ary wants. Thus, the arbitrary power of the &s;ultan, tran&s;mitted to the pacha and his &s;ub-delegates, becomes the main &s;pring of a tyranny, which circulates through every cla&s;s; whil&s;t its effects, by a reciprocal re-action, are every where fatal to agriculture, arts, commerce, population; in &s;hort, to every thing that con&s;titutes the power of the &s;tate; or, which is the &s;ame thing, the power of the Sultan him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This arbitrary power of the pacha, occa&s;ions abu&s;es likewi&s;e in the army. Perpetually urged by the want of money, he retrenches as far as po&s;&s;ible, the u&s;ual military e&s;tabli&s;hments. He dimini&s;hes the number
<PB N="200" REF="206">
of his troops; le&s;&s;ens their pay, winks at their di&s;|orders, and di&s;cipline no longer exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The emirs and pachas, all imitate the Sultan; all regard the country they govern, as their private pro|perty, and their &s;ubjects as their dome&s;tics; while they, in their turn, &s;ee in their &s;uperiors only tyran|nical ma&s;ters. It is a truth worthy of remark, that the greater part of the African and A&s;iatic States, e&s;|pecially &s;ince the days of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> have been govern|ed on the&s;e principles; and that no part of the world has exhibited &s;o many commotions and revolutions. May it not, therefore, be concluded, that arbitrary power is no le&s;s fatal to the military &s;trength, than the finance of a nation.</P>
<P>The pacha, as being the image of the Sultan, is the head of all the police. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power of life and death; and this he exerci&s;es with|out any formality, or giving time for an appeal. When he meets with a criminal, he orders him to be &s;eized; and the executioner, by whom he is attended, &s;trangles him, or &s;trikes off his head upon the &s;pot; nay, &s;ome|times the pacha him&s;elf does not di&s;dain this office. The pachas frequently &s;troll about di&s;gui&s;ed, and woe to the man whom they &s;urpri&s;e in a fault. As they cannot be pre&s;ent every where, they commit this duty to a deputy, called the Wali, who patroles night and
<PB N="201" REF="207">
day; keeps a watchful eye on the &s;editious; appre|hends robbers; and, like the pacha, judges and con|demns without appeal. This officer has a multitude of &s;pies, who are mo&s;t of them thieves; and by their means, he knows every thing that pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e pre&s;ides over the police of the mar|kets; there he in&s;pects their weights and mea&s;ures; and, on this head, his puni&s;hment is &s;evere. For any, the &s;malle&s;t deficiency in the weight of bread, meat, or confectionary, he will inflict five hundred &s;trokes of the ba&s;tinado, and &s;ometimes cau&s;e the offender to be put to death, Examples of &s;uch puni&s;hment are not unfrequent in the great cities, yet there is no country where fal&s;e weights are more common; all the dealer has to do, is to keep a &s;harp look out for the pa&s;&s;ing of the wali. When they appear, the deficient weights are &s;ecreted. The dealers al&s;o bargain with the &s;er|vants who precede him; and, for a certain &s;um, can in|&s;ure impunity.</P>
<P>The office of the wali, by no means extends to tho&s;e objects of utility, which are under the regulation of the police in European cities. No attention is paid either to cleanline&s;s, or &s;alubrity. The &s;treets are never paved, &s;wept, or watered, either in Syria, or Egypt. They are narrow and winding, and, in ge|neral, encumbered with rubbi&s;h. Travellers are above
<PB N="202" REF="208">
all, &s;hocked with the &s;ight of a multitude of hideous dogs, which have no owner. They form a &s;ort of in|dependent body, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on public arms. They are quartered in di&s;tricts; and &s;hould one of them happen to pa&s;s his limits, a combat en&s;ues, which is extremely trouble&s;ome to pa&s;&s;engers. The Turks do not kill the&s;e dogs, though they avoid touching them as un|clean. They pretend, they en&s;ure the &s;afety of the cities by night; but this is more owing to the wali and the gates, with which every &s;treet is &s;ecured.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>THE admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in civil &s;uits, is the only &s;pecies of authority, which the &s;ultans have withheld from the pachas. All the magi&s;trates of the empire, depend on one principal chief, who re|&s;ides at Con&s;tantinople. This grand cadi names the judges of the capital cities, &s;uch as Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, Jeru&s;alem, &amp;c. The&s;e judges again name others within their juri&s;diction. But all the&s;e employments,

<PB N="203" REF="210">
like tho&s;e of the government, are fold to the be&s;t bid|der, and farmed from year to year.</P>
<P>The tribunal whence the&s;e cadi's i&s;&s;ue their deci|&s;ions, is called the Mahkama, or place of judgment. In an empty mean apartment, the cadi is &s;eated on a mat, or wretched carpet. On each &s;ide are his clerks and &s;ome dome&s;tics. The door is open to every one; the parties appear; and there, without interpreters, ad|vocates, or attornies, each pleads his own cau&s;e. Squatted on the ground, they &s;tate the facts, di&s;cu&s;s, reply, conte&s;t, and argue again in their turns. Some|times the debates are violent; but the cries of the clerks, and the &s;taff of the cadi, &s;oon re&s;tore order and &s;ilence. Gravely &s;moking his pipe, and twi&s;ting the end of his beard, this judge li&s;tens, interrogates, and concludes by pronouncing a &s;entence, which, at mo&s;t, allows but two months delay. The parties are &s;eldom &s;atisfied; they retire, however, with re&s;pect, and pay a fee, e&s;timated at one-tenth of the property litigated, without murmuring at the deci&s;ion, as it is invariably dictated by the infallible Alcoran.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, this &s;implicity of ju&s;tice, which does not con&s;ume the property in litigation, or compel the ab&s;ence of the pleader from his place of re&s;idence, are two very great advantages; but, on the other hand, they are counter-balanced by abu&s;es. Daily
<PB N="204" REF="211">
experience, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> proves there is no country where ju&s;tice is more corrupt than in Egypt and Syria, and no doubt in all the re&s;t of the empire. The parties may bargain for their cau&s;e with the cadi, as they would for any common commodity. Corrup|tion is habitual and general; and how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, where integrity may be ruinous, and inju&s;|tice lucrative; and where each cadi, deciding without appeal, fears neither a rever&s;ion of his &s;entence, nor puni&s;hment for his partiality.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate of juri&s;prudence, throughout the Turki&s;h empire. There exi&s;ts no public and ac|knowledged code, where individuals may in&s;truct them&s;elves in their re&s;pective rights; the judgments being, in general, founded on unwritten cu&s;toms, or the frequently contradictory deci&s;ions of the doctors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Influence of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>IN vain do the Mahometans boa&s;t, that the koran contains the &s;eeds, and even the perfection, of all political and legi&s;lative knowledge. Whoever reads this revered book, mu&s;t be obliged to confe&s;s, that it contains nothing which con&s;titutes a legi&s;lative code. The only laws we find in it, may be reduced to four or five ordinances, relative to polygamy, divorces, &s;lavery, and the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and even the&s;e are &s;o contradictory, that they are not to be recon|ciled. The re&s;t is merely a chaos of unmeaning phra&s;es, an emphatical declaration on the attributes of God; or a collection of puerile tales, and ridiculous fables, &s;o flat and fa&s;tidious, that no man can read it to the end. <HI>Mahomet</HI> did not wi&s;h to enlighten men, but to rule over them; he &s;ought not di&s;ciples, but &s;ubjects; and obedience, not rea&s;oning, is required from them. All the legi&s;lators of antiquity, have, in vain, exhau&s;ted their genius, to explain the relations of
<PB N="206" REF="213">
man in &s;ociety; <HI>Mahomet,</HI> more able, or more pro|found than they, re&s;olves all into a few phra&s;es. It is certain, that of all the men who have ever attempted to give laws to nations, none was ever &s;o ignorant as <HI>Mahomet;</HI> nor was a compo&s;ition produced to the world, &s;o truly wretched as his book. Of this, the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t twelve hundred years in A&s;ia, are a proof; the convul&s;ions of the governments, and the ignorance of the people, in this quarter of the globe, having originated more or le&s;s in the koran, and its morality.</P>
<P>The koran, however, is not without its &s;ublimity. I think the ideas conveyed by <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s vi&s;ion, &s;uch as de&s;erve the notice of the world. This vi&s;ion, &s;eems to be a copy of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s trance; wherein he was, in a few hours, taken up into the third heaven, and &s;hewn all the glories of the godhead. So boa&s;ted the im|po&s;tor <HI>Mahomet.</HI> He pretended, that the angel <HI>Ga|briel</HI> took him out of his bed one night, and carried him up in a cloud to the empyreum, and &s;hewed him the &s;eventeen heavens; and to increa&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ed miracle, he declared, that in his flight from his room, a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of water was overthrown, and that the angel had returned him to his bed before all the water had run out. This &s;tory, I &s;ay, &s;erves to give us &s;ome idea of Omnipotence, either in lengthening out a few mo|ments of time to that age, required for &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age,

<P>The people of Syria, we have &s;aid, are, in general, Mahometans or Chri&s;tians. This difference of wor|&s;hip, is productive of the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable effects in their civil &s;tate. Faithful to the &s;pirit of the koran, the Turks treat the Chri&s;tians with a &s;everity, which di&s;plays it&s;elf in various forms. A Chri&s;tian cannot &s;trike a Mahometan, without ri&s;k of his life; but, if a Mahometan kills a Chri&s;tian, he e&s;capes for a &s;tipu|lated price. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t not mount on hor&s;eback in the towns; they are prohibited the u&s;e of yellow &s;lippers, white &s;hawls, and every &s;ort of green colour.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> State of the Pea&s;ants, and of Agriculture.</HEAD>
<P>IN Syria, and even throughout the Turki&s;h empire, the pea&s;ants, like the other inhabitants, are deem|ed <HI>&s;laves</HI> of the Sultan; but this term, only conveys the meaning of our word, &s;ubjects. Though ma&s;ter of their lives and properties, the Sultan does not &s;ell them, nor does he limit them to a certain &s;pot. If he be&s;tows an appanage on &s;ome grandee, it is not &s;aid, as in Ru&s;&s;ia and Poland, that he gives him five hundred, or a thou&s;and pea&s;ants; in a word, the pea&s;ants, though oppre&s;&s;ed by the tyranny of the government, are not degraded by the &s;ervitude of foedality.</P>
<P>When Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> conquered Syria, in order to render the collection of the revenue more ea&s;y, he e&s;|tabli&s;hed a &s;ingle territorial tribute, called the <HI>miri.</HI> This tribute, at the time it was fixed, was very trifling, it amounted to, &s;carce nothing. Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> not|with&s;tanding the ferocity of his character, &s;eems to have under&s;tood the importance of favouring the hu&s;|bandman.
<PB N="210" REF="218">
That this tax might be regularly collected, he gave orders to prepare a regi&s;ter, in which the con|tingent of each village &s;hould be &s;et down. In &s;hort, this miri was fixed at an invariable rate, never to be augmented nor dimini&s;hed. Not daring to violate the law e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Sultan, re&s;pecting the immu|tability of the impo&s;t, the pachas have introduced a multitude of charges, which produces all the effects of an augmentation.</P>
<P>Thus, having the greate&s;t part of the lands at their di&s;po&s;al, they clog their conce&s;&s;ions with burden&s;ome conditions, by exacting the half, and &s;ometimes two-thirds of the crop; or by monopolizing the feed of the cattle, which the cultivators are under the nece&s;|&s;ity of purcha&s;ing from them at their own price. The harve&s;t over, they cavil about lo&s;&s;es, and pretended robberies; and, as they have the power in their hands, they carry off what they think proper. If the &s;ea&s;on fails, they &s;till exact the &s;ame &s;um; and, to pay them&s;elves, expo&s;e every thing the poor pea&s;ant has to &s;ale. Happily, his per&s;on, at lea&s;t, remains free; for the Turks are ignorant of the refinement of impri&s;on|ing, for debt, the man who has no longer any pro|perty.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;tant oppre&s;&s;ions are added a thou&s;and accidental extortions. Sometimes the whole village
<PB N="211" REF="219">
is laid under contribution, for &s;ome real or imaginary offence; and &s;ometimes a &s;ervice of a new kind is in|troduced. A pre&s;ent is exacted on the acce&s;&s;ion of each governor; a contribution of gra&s;s is demanded for his hor&s;es, and barley and &s;traw for his cavaliers; they mu&s;t provide likewi&s;e, for all the &s;oldiers, who pa&s;s or carry orders; and the governors take care to multiply the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, which are a &s;aving to them, but inevitable ruin to the pea&s;ants. The vil|lages tremble at every <HI>Lawend</HI> who appears; he is a real robber, under the name of a &s;oldier; he enters as a conqueror, and commands like a mon&s;ter: <HI>dogs, rabble;</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>bring me bread, coffee, tobacco; I mu&s;t have; I mu&s;t have meat.</HI> If he ca&s;ts his eyes on any poultry, he kills them; and when he takes his depar|ture, adding in&s;ult to tyranny, he demands what is called, the hire of his grinders. In vain do the pea|&s;ants exclaim again&s;t this inju&s;tice; the &s;abre impo&s;es &s;ilence. What is the con&s;equence of all the&s;e depre|dations? The poorer cla&s;s of inhabitants ruined, be|come a burthen to the village, or fly into the cities; but the miri is unalterable, and the &s;um to be levied, mu&s;t be found &s;omewhere; con&s;equently, their portion falls on the remaining inhabitants, who&s;e burthen, though at fir&s;t light, now becomes in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method is adopted, with re&s;pect to the capitation of the Chri&s;tians. Its amount having been
<PB N="212" REF="220">
e&s;timated at the time they were fir&s;t numbered, it mu&s;t always produce the &s;ame, though tho&s;e who pay &s;hould be le&s;s numerous. Hence, it happens, that this capi|tation is &s;ometimes carried from three, five, and eleven pia&s;tres, at which it was fir&s;t rated, to five and thirty, and forty; which ab&s;olutely impoveri&s;hes tho&s;e on whom it is rai&s;ed, and obliges them to leave the country. The&s;e burthens are, more e&s;pecially, op|pre&s;&s;ive in tho&s;e countries, be&s;towed as an appanage; and, likewi&s;e, in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to the ravages of the Arabs.</P>
<P>In the former, the Titulary, greedy to augment his revenue, delegates full power to his le&s;&s;ee, to aug|ment the taxes, who is well &s;econded by the avidity of his &s;ubalterns. The&s;e men, refining on the arts of wringing money from the people, have contrived to impo&s;e duties on every commodity brought to mar|ket on entries, on the conveyance of goods, and even on the burthen of an a&s;s. With re&s;pect to the Be|douins, if they are at war, they pillage as enemies; if at peace, they devour every thing as gue&s;ts: hence, the proverb, <HI>Avoid the Bedouin, whether friend or ene|my.</HI> When the pea&s;ants are in want of money to pur|cha&s;e grain, cattle, &amp;c. they can find none, but by mortgaging the whole, or part of their future crop, at a mo&s;t exorbitant rate of intere&s;t, amounting &s;ome|times to thirty and forty per cent.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="221">From all the&s;e cau&s;es, the art of cultivation is in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate; the hu&s;bandman is de&s;titute of in&s;truments, or has bad ones; his plough is frequently no more than the branch of a tree, cut below a bifur|cation, and u&s;ed without wheels. The ground is tilled by a&s;&s;es and cows, rarely by oxen, which would be|&s;peak too much riches; beef is, therefore, very &s;carce in Syria and Egypt, be&s;ides being lean and bad, like all the meat of hot countries. In the di&s;tricts expo&s;ed to the Arabs, as in Pale&s;tine, the countryman mu&s;t &s;ow with his mu&s;ket in his hand. Scarcely does the corn turn yellow, before it is reaped and concealed in &s;ub|terraneous caverns. As little as po&s;&s;ible is kept for feed, becau&s;e they &s;ow no more than is barely nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; in &s;hort, their whole indu&s;try is confined to a &s;upply of their immediate wants; and, to procure a little bread, a few onions, a wretched blue &s;hirt, and a bit of woollen, much labour is not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the Arti&s;ans, Traders, and Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>THAT cla&s;s of men, which give value to raw mate|rials, by manufacturing them, is not &s;o ill treated in Syria, as the cla&s;s which produces them; the rea&s;on of which is, that the property of the arti&s;ans, and tra|ders is more concealed from the &s;crutinizing eye of government, than that of the pea&s;ants. This is one of the principal cau&s;es of the populou&s;ne&s;s of the towns in Syria, and all over Turkey. While, in other countries, the cities are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the over|flow of the country; here they are the effect of its de&s;ertion. The pea&s;ants expelled from their villages, fly into them for refuge, and find there tranquillity, and even a degree of ea&s;e and plenty.</P>
<P>The pachas are particularly attentive to this la&s;t ar|ticle, as on it depends their per&s;onal &s;afety. They, therefore, take care to keep provi&s;ions cheap, in all the con&s;iderable towns, e&s;pecially in that where they
<PB N="215" REF="223">
re&s;ide. In ca&s;e of a failure in the harve&s;t, they pro|hibit the exportation of grain, and oblige every per|&s;on to &s;ell it at a fixed price, under pain of death.</P>
<P>Commerce, in Syria, is &s;till in that &s;tate of infancy, which characteri&s;es barbarous ages, and uncivilized countries. Along the whole coa&s;t, there is not a har|bour capable of admitting a ve&s;&s;el of four hundred tons, nor are the roads &s;ecured by forts. In the in|terior parts of the country, there are neither great roads nor canals, nor even bridges over the greate&s;t part of the rivers and torrents, however nece&s;&s;ary they may be in winter. Between town and town, there are neither po&s;ts nor public conveyance. The only convenience of this kind, is the Tartar courier, who comes from Con&s;tantinople to Dama&s;cus, by way of Aleppo. This courier has no relays but in the large towns, which are at great di&s;tances from each other; but, in ca&s;e of need, he may di&s;mount the fir&s;t hor&s;e|man he meets. He leads with him, according to the cu&s;tom of the Tartars, a &s;econd hor&s;e in hand, and has frequently a companion, for fear of accidents. The communication between one city and another, is kept up by carriers, who have no fixed time of depar|ture. This ari&s;es from the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of form|ing troops, or caravans, as no one travels alone, from the in&s;ecurity of the roads.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="224">It is remarkable, that there are no waggons or carts to be &s;een in Syria. Every thing is carried on the backs of mules, a&s;&s;es, or camels; all which animals are excellent here. The two former are employed in the mountains; and nothing can equal their addre&s;s, in climbing and &s;liding over the &s;lopes of the craggy rocks. The camel is more u&s;ed in the plains, becau&s;e he con&s;umes le&s;s, and carries more. His u&s;ual bur|then, is about &s;even hundred and fifty pounds. His food is every thing his ma&s;ter chu&s;es to give him; &s;traw, brambles, pounded dates, beans, barley, &amp;c. With a &s;ingle pound of food, and as much water in a day, he will travel for weeks together. In the whole way from Cairo to Suez, which is a journey of forty, or forty-&s;ix hours, they neither eat nor drink; but the&s;e fa&s;tings repeated, exhau&s;t them as well as other animals. Their breath then becomes foetid. Their ordinary pace is very &s;low, not exceeding two miles, or two miles and a quarter, an hour. It is needle&s;s to pre&s;s them, they will go no quicker; but, by allowing them re&s;t, they will travel fifteen or eigh|teen hours in a day.</P>
<P>There are no inns any where; but, as in other parts of Turkey, and likewi&s;e in Spain, the cities, and commonly the villages, have their <HI>khan,</HI> which &s;erves as an a&s;ylum for travellers. The&s;e hou&s;es of reception, are always built without the precincts of
<PB N="217" REF="225">
the towns. The lodgings in them are cells, where nothing is to be found but bare walls, du&s;t, and &s;ome|times &s;corpions. A mat, and the key of the chamber, is all that the keeper of the khan furni&s;hes. The traveller mu&s;t, therefore, carry with him his bed, his kitchen uten&s;ils, and even his provi&s;ions. The bag|gage of a man, who wi&s;hes to be completely provided, con&s;i&s;ts in a carpet, a mattra&s;s, a blanket, two &s;aucepans, with lids, contained within each other; two di&s;hes, two plates, and a coffee-pot; a &s;mall wooden box for &s;alt and pepper; &s;ix coffee cups, without han|dles, in a leathern box; a round leathern table, which he &s;u&s;pends from the &s;addle of his hor&s;e; &s;mall lea|thern pouches, or bags for oil; melted butter, water, and, if a Chri&s;tian, brandy; a pipe, a tinder-box, a cup of cocoa-nut, &s;ome rice, dried rai&s;ins, dates, Cy|prus chee&s;e; and, above all, coffee berries, with a roa&s;ter, and wooden mortar to pound them.</P>
<P>Our European merchants, not being contented with &s;uch &s;imple accommodations, their journeys are very expen&s;ive and le&s;s frequent; but, the riche&s;t na|tives, make no difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing their lives tra|velling in this manner, between Bagdad, Ba&s;&s;ora, Cairo, and Con&s;tantinople. Travelling is their edu|cation, and their &s;cience. To &s;ay of any man he is a merchant, is to pronounce him a traveller. They find in it, the advantage of purcha&s;ing their goods at
<PB N="218" REF="226">
the fir&s;t hand, procuring them at a cheaper rate, en|&s;uring their &s;afety, by e&s;corting them them&s;elves; pre|venting many accidents, and obtaining &s;ome abate|ment of the numerous tolls. They learn, be&s;ides, to under&s;tand weights and mea&s;ures; the extreme diver|&s;ity of which, renders theirs a very complicated pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Each town has its peculiar weight, which, under the &s;ame denomination, differs from that of another.</P>
<P>Coin is more fixed; a per&s;on may travel over the whole empire, from Choczim, on the borders of Ru&s;&s;ia, to Syene, adjoining to Nubia, without expe|riencing any change in its denomination or value. The mo&s;t &s;imple of their coins is the <HI>Para;</HI> called al&s;o, a <HI>Medin,</HI> a <HI>Fadda,</HI> a <HI>Kata,</HI> or a <HI>Me&s;ria.</HI> It is the &s;ize of an Engli&s;h &s;ilver three-pence; and is worth &s;omething more than an halfpenny. After the para, follow &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, pieces of five, ten, and twenty paras; then the <HI>Zolate,</HI> or <HI>I&s;lote,</HI> worth thirty paras. The pia&s;tre of the Lion, which is the coin mo&s;t generally u&s;ed in commerce, is worth about forty paras, or two &s;hillings and a penny, Engli&s;h. La&s;tly, there is the pia&s;tre of the dog, which is &s;ixty paras.</P>
<P>All the&s;e coins are &s;ilver, but with &s;uch a mixture of alloy, that the pia&s;tre of the dog is as large as an Eng|li&s;h crown, though intrin&s;ically worth only three &s;hil|lings
<PB N="219" REF="227">
and &s;ixpence. They bear no image, becau&s;e of the prohibition of the prophet, but only the cypher of the Sultan on one &s;ide, and on the other the&s;e words: <HI>Sultan of the two continents, Lord of the two &s;eas, the Sul|tan, &s;on of the Sultan&mdash;&s;truck at Stamboul</HI> (Con&s;tanti|ple) <HI>or at Maor,</HI> Cairo; the only two cities in the Turki&s;h empire, where there is a mint.</P>
<P>The gold coins are the &s;equin, called <HI>Dahab,</HI> or picca of gold, and &s;ometimes <HI>Zahr-Mahaboub,</HI> or well-beloved flower. It is worth three pia&s;tres, or forty paras each. There is likewi&s;e a &s;equin, but very rare to be met with, called <HI>Fondoucli,</HI> worth one hundred and &s;eventy paras. Be&s;ides the&s;e coins, which are tho&s;e of the whole Turki&s;h empire, &s;ome of the European &s;pecie are very current, &s;uch as the German dollars, and Venetian &s;equins. The Venetian &s;equins are in great reque&s;t, from the finene&s;s of their &s;tandard, and their being worn as trinkets by the women. Some of them wear two or three hundred, hung near the fore|head, at the edge of the head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The effect of this luxury, is the withdrawing con|&s;iderable &s;ums from circulation, which remain dead; be&s;ides, when any of the&s;e pieces return into common u&s;e, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to weigh them. The prac|tice of weighing money, is general in Syria, in Egypt, and all over Turkey. No piece, however effaced,
<PB N="220" REF="228">
is refu&s;ed there; the merchant draws out his &s;cales and weights, as in the days of <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he went to purcha&s;e his &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole commerce of Syria, is in the hands of the Franks, Greeks, and Armenians: for|merly it was engro&s;&s;ed by the Jews. The Mahome|tans have little to do with it; not that they are pre|vented by the prejudices of their religion, or by in|dolence, as &s;ome writers have a&s;&s;erted, but by ob&s;ta|cles thrown in their way by their own government. The Porte, in&s;tead of giving a decided preference to Turki&s;h &s;ubjects, finds it more lucrative to &s;ell their rights and indu&s;try to foreigners. Some European &s;tates have, by treaties, obtained a diminution of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties, to three per cent. while the mer|chandize of the &s;ubjects of the Sultan, pays &s;trictly ten, or when favoured, &s;even per cent. Be&s;ides this, when the duties are once paid in any port, the Frank is not liable to pay a &s;econd time in another. But the ca&s;e is different with the Turki&s;h &s;ubject. The Franks too, having found it convenient to employ Latin Chri&s;tians, as agents, have procured them a partici|pation of their privileges, and they are no longer &s;ub|ject to the power of the pachas, or amenable to Tur|ki&s;h ju&s;tice. They cannot be plundered, and whoever has a commercial proce&s;s with them, mu&s;t plead before the European con&s;ul. With &s;uch di&s;advantages, it is
<PB N="221" REF="229">
not &s;urpri&s;ing the Mahometans &s;hould relinqui&s;h com|merce to their rivals. The&s;e agents of the Franks, are known in the Levant, under the name of <HI>Baratary Drogmans; i. e.</HI> privileged interpreters. The <HI>Barat,</HI> or <HI>privilege,</HI> is a patent of which the Sultan makes a pre&s;ent to the amba&s;&s;adors re&s;iding at the Porte. For|merly, the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors made pre&s;ents of them to particular per&s;ons in each factory; but, within the la&s;t twenty years, they have been made to under&s;tand it is more lucrative to &s;ell them. The pre&s;ent price of them, is about two hundred and fifty pounds. Each amba&s;&s;ador has fifty given him, which are renewed on the death of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and form a very pretty per|qui&s;ite.</P>
<P>France has the greate&s;t trade to Syria, of any Eu|ropean nation. The factories, or as they are called, <HI>echelles,</HI> of the French, are &s;even in number. Aleppo, Scandaroon, Satakia, Tripoli, Saide, Acre, and Ramla. The &s;um of their impo&s;ts, amounts to about 250,000l. All this commerce pa&s;&s;es through the &s;ingle channel of Mar&s;eilles; and even the natives of Tur|key are prohibited from carrying on their commerce, except through the medium of the&s;e factors. Con|&s;idered relatively to the Turki&s;h empire, it may be affirmed, this commerce is more detrimental than ad|vantageous. For the articles exported, being all raw materials, the empire deprives it&s;elf of the advan|tages
<PB N="222" REF="230">
to be derived from the labour of its &s;ubjects. On the other hand, the commodities imported, being articles of pure luxury, only &s;erve to increa&s;e the di&s;|&s;ipation of the rich; whil&s;t, perhaps, they aggravate the wretched condition of the people, and the cla&s;s of cultivators.</P>

<P>THE arts, and trades in Syria, afford matter for much con&s;ideration. In the fir&s;t place, the re|ligion of <HI>Mahomet</HI> having prohibited all kinds of images and figures, there, of cour&s;e, exi&s;ts neither painting, &s;culpture, or engraving, nor any of the nu|merous profe&s;&s;ions dependent on them. Secondly, a multitude of our trades are rendered unnece&s;&s;ary, from the &s;mall quantity of furniture u&s;ed by the Orientals. The whole inventory of a wealthy fa|mily, con&s;i&s;ts in a carpet for the feet, in mats, cu|&s;hions,
<PB N="223" REF="231">
matra&s;&s;es, &s;ome &s;mall cotton cloths, copper and wooden platters for the table, a few &s;tewing pans, a mortar, a portable mill, a little porcelain, and &s;ome plates of copper, tinned. All our apparatus of ta|pe&s;try, and paper hangings, bed&s;teads, chairs, &s;tools, gla&s;&s;es, de&s;ks, bureaus, clo&s;ets; our beaufets, with their plate, and table &s;ervices; all our cabinet and uphol|&s;tery work, are luxuries totally unknown to them; &s;o that nothing is &s;o &s;imple as a Turki&s;h removal. Their cloathing is not more complicated, though more expen|&s;ive. They are &s;trangers to the hats, perukes, hair-dre&s;&s;ing, buttons, buckles, &s;tocks, laced ruffles, and all that &s;uperfluity with which we are &s;urrounded. Cotton or &s;ilk &s;hirts, which even the pachas do not count by dozens, and which have neither ruffles nor wai&s;tbands, nor plaited collars; an enormous pair of breeches, which &s;erve al&s;o by way of &s;tockings; a handkerchief on the head, another round the wai&s;t, with three large folds of cloth, compo&s;e the whole wardrobe of the Orientals. Their only articles of luxury are gold&s;mith's work, and which is confined to women's trinkets, &s;aucers for coffee, wrought like lace, the ornaments of their harne&s;s, their pipes, which are very beautiful; and the &s;ilk &s;tuffs of Aleppo and Da|ma&s;cus. In pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets of the towns, we meet with nothing but beaters of cotton, on tenters, retailers of &s;tuffs and mercery, barbers, tinners, lock|&s;miths,
<PB N="224" REF="232">
&s;adlers, and e&s;pecially &s;ellers of little loaves, hardware, grain, dates, and &s;weetmeats.</P>
<P>In the villages, the inhabitants limited to mere ne|ce&s;&s;aries, have no arts, but tho&s;e, without which they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; every one endeavours to &s;upply his own wants, that he may not be obliged to &s;hare what he has with others. Each family manufactures the coar&s;e cottons with which they are clothed. Every hou&s;e has its portable mill, with which the women grind the barley, or <HI>dourra,</HI> for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The flour from the&s;e mills is coar&s;e; and their little round loaves ill leavened, and badly baked; but they pre|&s;erve life, and that is all which is required. In the mountains, they do not pre&s;erve their vines, and they no where engraft trees; every thing, in &s;hort, re|minds us of the &s;implicity of ancient times. When the rea&s;on of this want of indu&s;try is a&s;ked, the an&s;wer is uniformly the &s;ame. "It is good enough. It is &s;ufficient: To what purpo&s;e would it be to do more?" They are right; &s;ince they would not be permitted to reap the benefit of their labours.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the arts in the&s;e countries, is highly in|tere&s;ting, as pre&s;erving the di&s;coveries in almo&s;t every re&s;pect of ancient times. For example, the &s;tuffs of Aleppo are not an Arabian invention. The dyes they have, are properly tho&s;e of Tyre. The manner

by which the ancients &s;ecured the harne&s;s of their hor&s;es, again&s;t the &s;troke of the &s;abre, is, undoubtedly, the &s;ame now u&s;ed at Aleppo and Dama&s;cus, for the head-&s;talls of their bridles.

<P>The cement they make u&s;e of, is, no doubt, that of the Greeks and Romans. To make it properly, they only u&s;e the lime when boiling, and mix with it one-third of &s;and, and another of a&s;hes and pounded brick-du&s;t. With this compo&s;ition they form wells, ci&s;terns, and vaults, which the water cannot pa&s;s through. The u&s;e of this cement, has been lately introduced at Paris, but it is of great antiquity in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We may affirm the &s;ame of the manner of working the iron mines in Lebanon, on account of its &s;implicity. It is the method now employed in the Pyrenees, and known under the name of the <HI>Catalonian forge.</HI> The furnace con&s;i&s;ts in a kind of chimney, formed in the &s;ide of a deep declivity. The funnel is filled with wood, which is &s;et fire to. The bellows is applied to the inferior mouth, and the iron ore poured in from above; the metal falls to the bottom, and is taken out by the &s;ame mouth at which the fire is lighted. Even

their ingenious wooden &s;liding locks, with which they barricade their &s;treets, may be traced back to the time of <HI>Solomon,</HI> who mentions them in his &s;ong.</P>
<P>To their mu&s;ic, we mu&s;t not a&s;cribe &s;o high an an|tiquity. It does not appear to have an earlier origin, than the age of califs; yet, as its principles were bor|rowed from the Greeks, it might afford matter of cu|rious ob&s;ervation, to adepts in that &s;cience. Cairo is, perhaps, the only place in Syria, or in Egypt, where there are a few &s;haiks, who under&s;tand the principles of the art. They have collections of airs, which are not noted in our manner, but written in characters, all the names of which are Per&s;ian. They have no mu&s;ic but vocal; for they neither know nor e&s;teem in&s;trumental. They are &s;trangers, likewi&s;e, to any other accompaniment than the uni&s;on, and the con|tinued ba&s;e of the monochord. Their airs, in point of character and execution, re&s;emble nothing we have heard in Europe, except the &s;eguidillas of the Spa|niards. They have divi&s;ions more laboured, even than tho&s;e of the Italians, and cadences, and inflexions of tones, impo&s;&s;ible to be imitated by European throats. Their performance is accompanied with &s;ighs and ge&s;tures, which paint the pa&s;&s;ions in a more lively manner, than we &s;hould venture to allow. To behold an Arab with his head inclined, his hand ap|plied to his ear, his eye-brows knit, his eyes langui&s;h|ing;
<PB N="227" REF="235">
to hear his plaintive tones, his lengthened notes, his &s;ighs and &s;obs, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to refrain from tears: and, indeed, they mu&s;t certainly find a plea&s;ure in &s;hedding them, &s;ince among all their &s;ongs, they con&s;tantly prefer tho&s;e which excite them mo&s;t; as among all accompli&s;hments, &s;inging is, that which they mo&s;t admire.</P>
<P>Dancing, which with us, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> holds an equal rank with mu&s;ic, is far from being held in the &s;ame e&s;|timation with the Arabs. This art, among them, is branded with a kind of &s;hame; a man cannot practi&s;e it without di&s;honour, and the exerci&s;e of it is only permitted to women. This judgment will appear to us &s;evere, but it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that in the Ea&s;|tern world, dancing is not an imitation of war, as among the Greeks, nor a combination of graceful at|titudes and movements, as with us; but a licentious imitation of the utmo&s;t wantonne&s;s of love. This is the &s;pecies of dance, which, brought from Carthage to Rome, announced the decline of her republican man|ners; and which &s;ince, revived in Spain by the Arabs, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts there, under the title of <HI>Fandango.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding the freedom of our manners, it would be difficult, without wounding the ear, accurately to de|&s;cribe it; it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the female dancer, with her arms extended, and an empa&s;&s;ioned air, &s;inging, and accompanying her &s;ong with ca&s;tanets,
<PB N="228" REF="236">
which &s;he holds between her fingers, executes, without changing her place, all tho&s;e motions of the body, which pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf carefully conceals under the veil of night. Such is their licentiou&s;ne&s;s, that none but pro&s;titutes venture to dance in public.</P>
<P>The intimate connexion between the arts and &s;ci|ences, leaves no room to doubt, that the latter are &s;till more neglected. The barbari&s;m of Syria and Egypt, is complete. In vain have &s;ome writers denied this a&s;&s;ertion, and talked of colleges, places of educa|tion, and books. The&s;e words, in Turkey, convey not the &s;ame idea as with us. The age of the califs, is pa&s;t among the Arabs, and yet to begin among the Turks. The&s;e two nations have, at pre&s;ent, neither geometricians, a&s;tronomers, mu&s;icians, nor phy&s;icians. Where &s;hould phy&s;icians be formed, &s;ince there are no e&s;tabli&s;hments of the kind; and anatomy is repug|nant to the prejudices of their religion? A&s;tronomy, indeed, they practi&s;e; but, by a&s;tronomy, they under|&s;tand only the decree of fate, by the motions of the &s;tars, and not the profound &s;cience of calculating their revolutions. The Monks of <HI>Mar-Hanna,</HI> who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of books, and maintain a corre&s;pondence with Rome, are not le&s;s ignorant than the re&s;t. Never, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> before my arrival, had they heard that the earth turned round the &s;un; and the zealots, find|ing
<PB N="229" REF="237">
it contradicted in the holy bible, were for treat|ing me as a heretic.</P>
<P>In examining the cau&s;es of the general ignorance of the Orientals, we &s;hall find the &s;carcity of books one of the principal. There are but two libraries in Syria, that of the Monks of Mar-Hanna, and that of Acre, both of which are very incon&s;iderable; one of them not exceeding three hundred volumes. The other is to be found in the form of government. Under the admini&s;tration of the Turks, there is no pro&s;pect of obtaining rank or fortune, through the channels of the &s;ciences. For this rea&s;on, the Orien|tals are ignorant from the &s;ame principle, that makes them poor. They may apply with ju&s;tice to &s;cience, what they &s;ay of the arts, "What good pur|po&s;e will it an&s;wer to do more?"</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP XIX.</HI> The Manners and Character of the Inhabitants of Syria.</HEAD>
<P>OF all &s;ubjects of ob&s;ervation to a traveller, the moral character of the inhabitants of a country is certainly the mo&s;t important. To &s;ucceed in &s;uch an enquiry, we mu&s;t live in the country, learn the language, and adopt the cu&s;toms of the inhabi|tants; conditions &s;eldom complied with by travellers; and which when they are, &s;till leave numerous diffi|culties to &s;urmount; for we are not only to combat the prejudices we may meet with in our way, but to overcome our own.</P>
<P>When a European arrives in Syria, or in any part of the Ea&s;tern world, what appears mo&s;t extraordinary to him, in the exterior of the inhabitants, is the almo&s;t total oppo&s;ition of their manners to his own. The mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;ts may be &s;een between the peo|ple of A&s;ia, and tho&s;e of Europe. We wear &s;hort and
<PB N="231" REF="239">
clo&s;e dre&s;&s;es; theirs are long and ample. We &s;uffer our hair to grow, and &s;have the beard; they let their beard grow, and &s;have the head. With us, to uncover the head is a mark of re&s;pect; with them, a naked head is a &s;ign of folly. We &s;alute in an inclined po&s;|ture; they in an upright one. We pa&s;s our lives erect; they almo&s;t always &s;eated. They &s;it and eat on the ground; we on rai&s;ed &s;eats. With re&s;pect to language likewi&s;e; their manner of writing is con|trary to ours; and mo&s;t of our ma&s;culine nouns, are feminine with them.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic, is that reli|gious exterior in the countenances, conver&s;ation, and ge&s;tures of the inhabitants of Turkey. In their &s;treets every one appears with his &s;tring of beads. There is &s;till another characteri&s;tic in the exterior of the Orientals, which attracts the attention of an ob&s;erver; that is, their grave and phlegmatic air. In&s;tead of the open and cheerful countenance, which we either na|turally po&s;&s;e&s;s or a&s;&s;ume, their behaviour is &s;erious, au&s;tere, and melancholy: they rarely laugh, and the gaiety of the French appears to them a fit of deli|rium. When they &s;peak, it is with deliberation, with|out ge&s;tures, and without pa&s;&s;ion; they li&s;ten without interruption; they are &s;ilent for whole days together, and by no means pique them&s;elves on &s;upporting conver&s;ation. If they walk, it is always lei&s;urely
<PB N="232" REF="240">
and on bu&s;ine&s;s; they have no idea of our trouble|&s;ome activity, and walking backward and forward for amu&s;ement. Continually &s;eated, they pa&s;s whole days mu&s;ing, with their legs cro&s;&s;ed, their pipes in their mouths, and almo&s;t without changing their atti|tude.</P>
<P>As to the &s;edentary life of the natives, what motives has a man to be&s;tir him&s;elf, in a country where the police has never thought either of laying out walks, or encouraging plantations; where there is no &s;afety without the towns, nor plea&s;ure within the precincts; where every thing, in &s;hort, invites us to &s;tay at home?</P>
<P>The compari&s;on of our civil and dome&s;tic &s;tate, with that of the Orientals, will furni&s;h &s;till further rea|&s;ons for that phlegm, which con&s;titutes their general character. One of the chief &s;ources of gaiety with us, is the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of the table, and the u&s;e of wine. The Orientals, are almo&s;t &s;trangers to this double enjoyment. Another &s;ource of enjoyment with Europeans, is the free intercour&s;e between the two &s;exes, which prevailed more particularly in France. In A&s;ia, on the contrary, women are rigorou&s;ly ex|cluded the &s;ociety of men. Every body mu&s;t be &s;trangers to them; and they mu&s;t be &s;uffered to pa&s;s along the &s;treets, as if there were &s;omething contagious
<PB N="233" REF="241">
in their nature. In fact, <HI>Mahomet,</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately fond as he was of women, has not done them the honour of treating them in his koran, as belonging to the hu|man &s;pecies; and it is even a &s;ort of problem with the Mahometans, whether women have any &s;ouls. The government is &s;till more unju&s;t towards them; for it denies them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any landed pro|perty, and &s;o completely deprives them of every kind of per&s;onal liberty, as to leave them dependant all their lives on their male relations.</P>
<P>This &s;ituation of the women, among the Orientals, occa&s;ions a great contra&s;t between their manners and ours. Such is their delicacy on this head, that, as we have ob&s;erved before, they never &s;peak of them. When we give them &s;ome account of European man|ners, it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment. They are unable to conceive how our women go with their faces uncovered, when in their country, an up|lifted veil, is the mark of a pro&s;titute, or a &s;ignal for a love adventure. They have no idea how it is po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ee them, talk with them, or touch them with|out emotion; or be alone without proceeding to the la&s;t extremities.</P>
<P>What we are able to learn of the dome&s;tic life of hu&s;bands, who have &s;everal wives, is neither calcu|lated to make their lot envied, nor to give a high idea
<PB N="234" REF="242">
of this part of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s legi&s;lation. Their hou&s;e is a perpetual &s;cene of tumult and contention. The four legal married women complain, that their &s;laves are preferred to them; and the &s;laves, that they are aban|doned to the jealou&s;y of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. If one wife obtains a trinket, a token of favour, or permi&s;&s;ion to go to the bath, all the others require the &s;ame, and league together in the common cau&s;e. To re&s;tore peace, the polygami&s;t is obliged to a&s;&s;ume the tone of a de&s;pot; and from that moment, he meets with nothing but the &s;entiments of &s;laves, the appearance of fondne&s;s, yet real hatred. In vain does each of the&s;e women prote&s;t &s;he loves him more than the re&s;t; in vain do they fly on entering his apartments to pre|&s;ent him his pipe and &s;lippers, to prepare his dinner' or to &s;erve him with coffee; in vain, while he is effe|minately &s;tretched on his carpet, do they chace away the flies which incommode him; all the&s;e attentions and care&s;&s;es, have no other object than to procure an addition to their trinkets, and moveables; that if he &s;hould repudiate them, they may be able to tempt ano|ther hu&s;band, or find re&s;ource in what becomes their only property. They are merely courtezans, who think of nothing but to &s;trip their lover before he quits them; and this lover, long &s;ince deprived of de&s;ires, and teazed by feigned fondne&s;s, is far from enjoying an enviable &s;ituation. The contempt the Turks entertain for their women, ari&s;es from this con|currence
<PB N="235" REF="243">
of circum&s;tances, and is evidently the effect of their own cu&s;toms. How &s;hould women retain that exclu&s;ive love, which renders them mo&s;t e&s;timable, when &s;o many &s;hare in the affections of their hu&s;|bands? Or how &s;hould they po&s;&s;e&s;s that mode&s;ty which con&s;titutes their greate&s;t virtue, when the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cenes of debauchery are daily practi&s;ed before their eyes? How, in &s;hort, &s;hould they be en|dowed with the manners requi&s;ite to make them ami|able, when no care whatever is taken of their educa|tion?</P>
<P>After what we have &s;aid of the manners of the Orientals, we &s;hall be no longer &s;urpri&s;ed, that their whole character partakes of the monotony of their pri|vate life, and of the &s;tate of &s;ociety in which they live. Even in the cities, where we &s;ee mo&s;t acti|vity, as at Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, and Cairo, all their amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;t in going to the bath, or meeting to|gether in coffee-hou&s;es, re&s;embling ours only in name. There, in a large room, filled with &s;moak, &s;eated on ragged mats, the wealthier cla&s;s of people pa&s;s whole days in &s;moaking their pipes, talking of bu&s;ine&s;s in conci&s;e phra&s;es, uttered at long intervals, and frequently in &s;aying nothing.</P>
<P>Of all the different &s;pecies of public exhibitions, the only one they know, and which is common at
<PB N="236" REF="244">
Cairo alone, is that of &s;trollers, who &s;hew feats of &s;trength like our rope-dancers, and tricks of &s;light-of-hand like our jugglers. We there &s;ee &s;ome of them eating flints, others breathing flames; &s;ome cutting their arms, or perforating their no&s;es, without receiv|ing any hurt; and others devouring &s;erpents. The people, from whom they carefully conceal the &s;ecrets of their art, entertain a &s;ort of veneration for them, and call the&s;e extraordinary performances by a name, which &s;ignifies <HI>prodigy</HI> or <HI>miracle.</HI> This propen&s;ity of believing the mo&s;t extraordinary feats or tales, is a re|markable feature in the character of the Orientals. They admit, without he&s;itation, or the lea&s;t &s;hadow of doubt, the mo&s;t wonderful things that can be told them; and, if we regard the tales current among them, as many prodigies happen every day, as have been a&s;cribed to the age of the <HI>Genii</HI> and fairies; the rea|&s;on of which, no doubt is, that being ignorant of the ordinary cour&s;e of phy&s;ical and moral cau&s;es, they know not the limits between probability and impo&s;|&s;ibility. Be&s;ides having been accu&s;tomed, from their earlie&s;t youth, to believe the extravagant fables of the koran, they are entirely de&s;titute of any &s;tandard of analogy, to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;hood. Their credulity, therefore, ari&s;es from ignorance, and the nature of their government. To this credulity, their extravagance of imagination, is, in a great mea&s;ure, to be attributed; but, though deprived of this &s;ource,
<PB N="237" REF="245">
their works would &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s many brilliant orna|ments.</P>
<P>In general, the Orientals are remarkable for a clear conception, an ea&s;y expre&s;&s;ion, a propriety of language in the things they are acquainted with, and a pa&s;&s;ionate and nervous &s;tile. They have particularly a ta&s;te for moral &s;entences, and their proverbs &s;hew they can unite ju&s;tne&s;s of ob&s;ervation, and profundity of thought, with an ingenuity of force and expre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Their conver&s;ation appears at fir&s;t, to have a &s;ort of coldne&s;s, but when we are more accu&s;tomed to it, we find our&s;elves greatly attached to them. Such is the good opinion with which tho&s;e who have had mo&s;t communication with them have been impre&s;&s;ed, that the greater part of our travellers and merchants allow, that they find them a people of a more humane and gene|rous character, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more &s;implicity, and more refined and open manners, than even the inha|bitants of European countries; as if the A&s;iatics, hav|ing been poli&s;hed long before us, &s;till pre&s;erved the traces of their early improvement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Of the Religion and Funerals of the Ancient Egyptians.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION and man were born together. Before he was ble&s;&s;ed with revelation, objects which a&s;toni&s;hed, from which he received the greate&s;t bene|fits, or dreaded mo&s;t, by turns attracted veneration. To rivers, &s;eas, &s;torms, and the &s;un, he addre&s;&s;ed his prayers, and erected altars. The le&s;s he knew of the phenomena of nature, the more he believed in hidden powers. All nations have adored, under different names, invi&s;ible &s;pirits, either praying for protection, or deprecating wrath. Men, enlightened by &s;ublime philo&s;ophy only, can behold him who pre&s;ides over the univer&s;e, or &s;uppo&s;e a plurality of gods ab|&s;urd.</P>
<P>Never were any people &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as the Egyp|tians. They had a great number of gods of different orders and degrees. Among the re&s;t, two were uni|ver&s;ally adored, <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> and <HI>I&s;is;</HI> which are &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="239" REF="247">
to have been &s;ymbolical of the &s;un and moon. Be&s;ides the&s;e deities, the Egyptians wor&s;hipped a great num|ber of bea&s;ts, as the ox, the dog, the wolf, the hawk, the crocodile, the ibis, the cat, &amp;c. Many of the&s;e bea&s;ts were the objects of &s;uper&s;tition, only to &s;ome particular cities; and, whil&s;t the people of one city wor&s;hipped one &s;pecies of animals as gods, tho&s;e of an adjoining one held them in abomination. This was the origin of the continual wars between different ci|ties; and, is &s;aid to have taken its ri&s;e from the fal&s;e policy of one of their &s;overeigns; who, in order to pre|vent con&s;piring again&s;t the &s;tate, devi&s;ed this means of engaging them in religious conte&s;ts.</P>
<P>It was death for any per&s;on to kill one of the&s;e ani|mals wilfully; and a puni&s;hment was even decreed again&s;t him, who &s;hould have killed an ibis, or a cat, though unintentionally. As a proof of this, <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> relates an incident he was witne&s;s to, during his &s;tay in Egypt. A Roman had inadvertently, and without de&s;ign, killed a cat; the exa&s;perated populace ran to his hou&s;e, and neither the authority of the king, who &s;ent his guard, nor the terror of the Roman name, could re&s;cue the unfortunate criminal. Such was the reverence the Egyptians had for the&s;e ani|mals, that, in an extreme famine, they cho&s;e rather to eat one another, than feed on their imaginary deities.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="248">Of all the&s;e animals, the bull <HI>Apis</HI> was the mo&s;t fa|mous. Magnificent temples were erected to him; ex|traordinary honours were paid him while he lived; and &s;till greater after his death. Egypt then went into a general mourning. His ob&s;equies were &s;olemnized with &s;uch a pomp, as is &s;carce credible. In the reign of <HI>Ptolemy Logus,</HI> the bull <HI>Apis</HI> dying of old age, the funeral pomp, be&s;ides the ordinary expences, amount|ed to twelve thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>It is pretty evident, that the golden calf, &s;et up by the I&s;raelites near Mount Sinai, was owing to their abode in Egypt, and an imitation of the god <HI>Apis,</HI> as well as tho&s;e which were afterwards &s;et up by <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> (who had re&s;ided long in Egypt) in the two extremities of the kingdom of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, not &s;atisfied with offering incen&s;e to animals, carried their folly to &s;uch exce&s;s, as to a&s;cribe a divinity to the pul&s;e and roots of their gardens. For this they have been ingeniou&s;ly reproached by the Roman &s;atyri&s;t, in one of his inimitable &s;atires. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee a nation, which boa&s;ted its &s;uperiority above all others, in wi&s;dom and learning, abandon it|&s;elf to the mo&s;t gro&s;s and ridiculous &s;uper&s;tition. In|deed, to read of animals and vile in&s;ects, honoured with religious wor&s;hip, placed in temples, and maintained with great care, and at an extravagant expence; to
<PB N="241" REF="249">
read that tho&s;e who killed them, were puni&s;hed with death; and, that the&s;e animals were embalmed and &s;olemnly depo&s;ited in tombs, a&s;&s;igned them by the public; to hear, in &s;hort, that this extravagance was carried to &s;uch lengths, that leeks and onions were ac|knowledged as deities, and depended upon for &s;uccour and protection, are exce&s;&s;es, which we at this di&s;tance of time can &s;carce credit; and yet they have the evi|dence of all antiquity. You enter, &s;ays <HI>Lucian,</HI> into a magnificent temple, every part of which glitters with gold and &s;ilver. You there look attentively for a god, and are cheated with a &s;tork, an ape, or a cat; a ju&s;t emblem, adds that writer, of too many palaces, the ma&s;ters of which, are far from being the brighte&s;t or|naments of them.</P>
<P>Several rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned for the wor&s;hip paid to animals by the Egyptians. The fir&s;t is drawn from fabulous hi&s;tory. It is pretended, that the gods, when mankind rebelled again&s;t them, &s;led into Egypt, and concealed them&s;elves under the forms of different ani|mals; and that the&s;e gave ri&s;e to the wor&s;hip after|wards paid to the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is taken from the benefit the&s;e animals procure to mankind: oxen by their labour; &s;heep by their wool and milk; dogs by their &s;ervice in hunting and guarding hou&s;es; whence the god <HI>Anubis</HI> was re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="242" REF="250">
with a dog's head. The Ibis, a bird re&s;em|bling a &s;tork, was wor&s;hipped, becau&s;e he put to flight the winged &s;erpents, with which Egypt would other|wi&s;e have been grievou&s;ly infected; the crocodile, an amphibious creature, of &s;urpri&s;ing &s;trength and &s;ize, was wor&s;hipped, becau&s;e he defended Egypt from the incur&s;ion of the wild Arabs; the ichneumon was ador|ed, becau&s;e he prevented the too great increa&s;e of the crocodiles, which might have proved de&s;tructive to Egypt. This little animal does this &s;ervice to the country two ways. Fir&s;t, he watches the time when the crocodile is ab&s;ent, and breaks his eggs, but does not eat them. Secondly, when the crocodile &s;leeps on the banks of the Nile, which he always does with his mouth open, this &s;mall animal lying concealed in the mud, leaps at once into his mouth, gets down his en|trails and gnaws them, then piercing his belly, the &s;kin of which is very tender he e&s;capes in &s;afety; and thus, by his addre&s;s and &s;ubtilty, becomes victorious over &s;o terrible an animal.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of chri&s;tianity, not &s;atisfied with the&s;e rea&s;ons, have a&s;&s;erted, that the wor&s;hip which the Egyptians paid to animals, was not offered to the animals them&s;elves, but to the gods of whom they were the &s;ymbols. <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his fa|mous treati&s;e on I&s;is and O&s;iris, the two mo&s;t famous deities of the Egyptians, &s;ays, that philo&s;ophers ho|nour
<PB N="243" REF="251">
the image of God, wherever they find it, even in inanimate beings, con&s;equently much more in tho&s;e which have life. We are, therefore, to approve not the wor&s;hip of the&s;e animals, but tho&s;e who, by their means, a&s;cend to the deity; they are to be con&s;idered as &s;o many mirrors which nature holds forth, and in which the Supreme Being di&s;plays him&s;elf in a won|derful manner. Should men, therefore, for the em|belli&s;hment of &s;tatues, collect together all the gold and precious &s;tones in the world, the wor&s;hip mu&s;t not be referred to the &s;tatues; for the deity does not vi&s;it in colours artfully di&s;po&s;ed, nor in frail matter, de&s;titute of &s;en&s;e and motion. <HI>Plutarch</HI> further adds, in the &s;ame treati&s;e, that as the &s;un, moon, heaven, earth, and &s;ea, are common to all men, but have different names, according to the difference of nations and languages; in like manner, though there is but one Deity or providence, which governs the univer&s;e, men give him different names, and pay him different ho|nours, according to the laws and cu&s;toms of their country.</P>
<P>The pyramids were erected as &s;o many &s;acred mo|numents, de&s;tined to tran&s;mit in future times the me|mory of great princes: they were likewi&s;e con&s;idered as the man&s;ions, where the body was to remain during a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages; different in this re&s;pect from hou&s;es which were called inns, and where men
<PB N="244" REF="252">
were to abide only as travellers, during the cour&s;e of a life too &s;hort to engage their affections.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on of a family died, all the kindred and friends quitted their u&s;ual habits, and went into mourning. They refrained al&s;o from baths, wine, and luxuries of every kind. This mourning la&s;ted forty or &s;eventy days, according to the quality of the per&s;on.</P>
<P>Bodies were embalmed three ways. The mo&s;t mag|nificent was be&s;towed on per&s;ons of rank, the expence of which amounted to a talent of &s;ilver, or about a hun|dred and twenty pounds.</P>
<P>Many hands were employed in this operation. Some drew the brain through the no&s;trils, by an in|&s;trument made for the purpo&s;e. Others emptied the bowels and inte&s;tines, by a hole cut in the &s;ide with an Egyptian &s;tone, which was very &s;harp; after which, the cavities were filled up with perfumes, and various odoriferous drugs. As this evacuation (which was nece&s;&s;arily attended with &s;ome di&s;&s;ection) &s;eemed cruel and inhuman, the per&s;ons employed in it, fled as &s;oon as the operation was over, and were pur&s;ued with &s;tones from the &s;tanders by. But tho&s;e who em|balmed the body were honourably treated. They filled it with myrrh, cinnamon, and all &s;orts of &s;pices.
<PB N="245" REF="253">
After a certain time, the body was &s;wathed in lawn fillets, glued together with a very thin gauze, and then cru&s;ted over with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfumes. By this means, the entire figure of the body, the linea|ments of the face, and the hair on the lids and eye|brows were pre&s;erved in their natural perfections. The body thus embalmed, was delivered up to he relations, who put it in a kind of open che&s;t, fitted exactly to the &s;ize, and placed it upright again&s;t the wall, either in &s;epulchres, if they had any, or in their hou&s;es. The&s;e embalmed bodies, are what are now called mummies, which are &s;till brought from Egypt, and to be &s;een in the cabinets of the curious. This &s;hews the care that the Egyptians took of their dead. Children, by &s;eeing the bodies of their ance&s;tors thus pre&s;erved, recalled to mind tho&s;e virtues for which the public had honoured them.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;olation among the heathens, to leave a good name behind them; and they imagined this the only human ble&s;&s;ing, of which death could not deprive them. But the Egyptians would not &s;uffer prai&s;es to be be&s;towed indi&s;criminately on all decea&s;ed per&s;ons. This honour was to be obtained only from the public voice. The a&s;&s;embly of the judges, met on the other &s;ide of the lake, which they cro&s;&s;ed in a boat. He who &s;at at the helm, was called <HI>Charon,</HI> in the Egyp|tian language; and, this fir&s;t gave the hint to <HI>Orpheus,</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="254">
who had been in Egypt, to invent the fiction of <HI>Cha|ron</HI>'s boat. As &s;oon as a man was dead, he was brought to his trial. The public accu&s;er was heard. If he proved, that the decea&s;ed had lived a bad life, his memory was condemned, and he was deprived of burial. The people were affected with laws, which extended beyond the grave; and every one &s;truck with the di&s;grace inflicted on the dead per&s;on, was afraid to reflect di&s;honour on his own memory, and that of his family. But if the decea&s;ed was not con|victed of any crime, he was interred in an honourable manner.</P>
<P>When, therefore, a favourable judgment was pro|nounced, the next thing was to proceed to the cere|mony of interment. In his panegyric, no mention was made of his name, becau&s;e every Egyptian was deemed noble. No prai&s;es were con&s;idered as ju&s;t or true, but &s;uch as related to the per&s;onal merit of the de|cea&s;ed. He was applauded for having received an excellent education in his early years; and, in a more advanced age, for having exerci&s;ed gentlene&s;s, mode|ration, and all other virtues, which con&s;titute the good man. Then all the people &s;houted, and be&s;towed the highe&s;t eulogiums on the decea&s;ed, as one, who would be for ever received into the &s;ociety of the vir|tuous, in the kingdom of <HI>Pluto.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> A De&s;cription of Egypt, from Volney, Savary, Norden, and Tott.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Country, Climate, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>EGYPT is bounded on the North, by the Medi|terranean; on the South, by a chain of moun|tains, &s;eparating it from Nubia; on the Ea&s;t, by the Red Sea, and the i&s;thmus of Suez; and its We&s;tern limits are the de&s;arts of Lybia; in the mid&s;t of which &s;tood the temple of <HI>Jupiter Ammon.</HI> Its greate&s;t length is about two hundred and twenty-five leagues, extending from Syene, which is &s;ituated under the tropic of Cancer, to Cape Buelos, which is the mo&s;t projecting land of the Delta, and almo&s;t terminates the thirty-&s;econd degree of North latitude.</P>
<P>The broade&s;t part is from Alexandria to Damietta; and from thence it grows gradually narrower and nar|rower, till it approaches Nubia, where it is enclo&s;ed
<PB N="248" REF="257">
between two chains of mountains, having the Nile and a plain between them, not above half a day's journey over.</P>
<P>It is divided into upper and lower; the former is a long valley beginning at Syene, and ending at Grand Cairo. Two ridges of mountains, taking their depar|ture from the la&s;t cataract, form the lofty outlines of upper Egypt: their parallel direction is from North to South, till they reach Grand Cairo; where, &s;epa|rating to the right and left, the one &s;tretches toward Mount Colzowm, and the other terminates in &s;and-banks near Alexandria. In this celebrated valley, man fir&s;t &s;ought and fir&s;t beheld the light of &s;cience, who&s;e radiance diffu&s;ing it&s;elf over Greece, has &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively enlightened the re&s;t of the world. This valley, though &s;till as fruitful as in the happy days of <HI>Thebes,</HI> is much le&s;s cultivated; its famous cities are laid level with the du&s;t; and laws and arts trodden under foot by ignorance and de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Lower Egypt, includes all the country lying be|tween Grand Cairo, the Mediterranean, the I&s;thmus of Suez, and Lybia. This immen&s;e plain, contains &s;lips of land, well cultivated, on the borders of the canals; and in its centre, that triangular i&s;land to which the Greeks gave the name of Delta, formed by the two branches of the Nile, which divide at Batri|el-Balkara
<PB N="249" REF="258">
(the cow's belly) and empty them&s;elves into the &s;ea; below Damietta and Ro&s;etta. This i&s;land, the mo&s;t fruitful on the earth, has lo&s;t much of its extent, &s;ince the time when Canopus and Pelu&s;ium were its limits. Mo&s;t of the canals, which with their &s;treams brought fertility, are dried up; and the earth cea&s;ing to be watered, and continually expo&s;ed to the burning heats of the &s;un, is become a barren &s;and. Tho&s;e that remain bear little re&s;emblance to their ancient &s;tate, and no longer communicate with the lake Menzala, except a very little while, during the time of the inundation; but they are dry all the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P>This country was called Mi&s;raim, by the Hebrews and Arabs, who &s;uppo&s;ed the fir&s;t &s;overeign was <HI>Mi&s;|raim,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Cham</HI> and grand&s;on of <HI>Noah.</HI> It was al&s;o called Coptus, from Coptus, the capital city of upper Egypt; and the natives were called Copts, as the Chri&s;tians in Egypt are to this day, and e&s;teemed the real de&s;cendants of the ancient Egyptians.</P>
<P>The climate of Egypt is e&s;teemed extremely hot. The height of the &s;un, which, in &s;ummer, nearly ap|proaches the zenith, is doubtle&s;s a primary cau&s;e of this heat; but when we con&s;ider, that in other coun|tries under the &s;ame latitude, the heat is le&s;s we may conclude, there exi&s;ts a &s;econdary one; and this, per|haps,
<PB N="250" REF="259">
is the country being &s;o little elevated above the level of the &s;ea. On this account, two &s;ea&s;ons only &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed in Egypt, the &s;pring and &s;um|mer; that is to &s;ay, the cool and the hot &s;ea&s;on. The latter continues from March to November; and even from the end of February, the &s;un is not &s;upportable, for a European, at nine o'clock in the morning. During the whole of this &s;ea&s;on, the air is inflamed, the &s;ky &s;parkling, and the heat oppre&s;&s;ive to all who are unaccu&s;tomed to it. The body &s;weats profu&s;ely, under the lighte&s;t dre&s;s, and in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t pro|found repo&s;e. And this per&s;piration becomes &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that the flighte&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of it is a &s;erious malady. The departure of the &s;un, tempers, in &s;ome degree, the&s;e heats. The vapours from the earth, &s;oaked by the Nile, and tho&s;e brought by the We&s;t, and North-we&s;t winds, ab&s;orbing the fire di&s;per&s;ed throughout the atmo&s;phere, produce an equal fre&s;h|ne&s;s, and piercing cold, if we may credit the natives and &s;ome European merchants; but the Egyptians, almo&s;t naked, and accu&s;tomed to per&s;pire, &s;hiver at the lea&s;t coolne&s;s. The thermometer, which at the lowe&s;t, in the month of February, &s;tands at the eighth or ninth degree of <HI>Reaumur</HI>'s &s;cale above the freez|ing point, enables us to determine with certainty; and we may pronounce, that &s;now and hail are pheno|mena, which no Egyptian has &s;een in fifty years. As for our merchants, their &s;en&s;ibility is owing to their improper u&s;e of furs, which is carried &s;o far, that in
<PB N="251" REF="260">
winter they have frequently two or three coverings of foxes-&s;kins; and even in &s;ummer, retain the er|mine, or <HI>petit-gris:</HI> in excu&s;e for this, they plead the chilline&s;s they experience in the &s;hade, as an indi&s;pen|&s;able rea&s;on; and, in fact, the Northerly and We&s;t|erly currents of air, which almo&s;t continually prevail, cau&s;e a very great coolne&s;s out of the &s;un; but the rea&s;on is, that the peli&s;e is the lace of Turkey, and their favourite luxury; it is the &s;ign of opulence and the etiquette of dignity; and the inve&s;titure of im|portant offices, is always accompanied with the pre&s;ent of a peli&s;e.</P>
<P>It might naturally be imagined that Egypt, from the&s;e heats, and its wet and mar&s;hy condition for three months, mu&s;t be an unhealthy country; but experience proves the fallacy of this &s;uppo&s;ition; the vapours of the &s;tagnant waters, &s;o fatal in Cyprus and Alexandretta, have not the &s;ame effect in Egypt. This appears to be owing to the natural dryne&s;s of the air, to the proximity of the de&s;arts, which ince&s;&s;antly draw off the humidity, and the perpetual currents of air which meet with no ob&s;tacles. This aridity is &s;uch, that raw meat, expo&s;ed even in &s;ummer, to the North wind, does not putri&s;y, but dries up, and be|comes hard as wood. In the de&s;arts, dead carca&s;es are found dried in this manner, which are &s;o light, that a per&s;on may ea&s;ily lift, with one hand, the entire body of a camel. It mu&s;t be remarked, however,
<PB N="252" REF="261">
that the air near the &s;ea, is infinitely le&s;s dry, than higher up the country: thus, at Alexandria and Ro|&s;etta, iron cannot be expo&s;ed twenty-four hours to the air, without ru&s;ting.</P>
<P>The air of Egypt, be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this drying quality, appears &s;trongly impregnated with &s;alts, the proofs of which are every where apparent. The &s;tones are corroded by natrum; and in moi&s;t places, long cry&s;tallizations of it are to be found, which might be taken for &s;alt-petre.</P>
<P>It is no doubt this property of the air and the earth, which added to the heat, gives vegetation an activity, &s;carce credible in our cold climates. Where|ever plants have water, the rapidity of their growth is prodigious. Whoever has travelled to Cairo, or Ro&s;etta, knows that the &s;pecies of gourd, called kara, will, in twenty-four hours, &s;end out &s;hoots near four inches long; but this &s;oil appears unfavourable to all exotics. Foreign plants degenerate there rapidly; the truth of which is confirmed by daily experience. The merchants are obliged every year, to renew their &s;eeds, and &s;end to Malta for their cauliflowers, beet|root, and carrots; which, when &s;own, &s;ucceed very well at fir&s;t; but if the &s;eed produced from them be afterwards &s;own, the plants run up tall and weak.
<PB N="253" REF="262">
The &s;ame happens to apricots, pears, and peaches, when tran&s;ported to Ro&s;etta.</P>
<P>Were heat the principle of di&s;ea&s;es, upper Egypt would not be habitable; but it only &s;eems to occa&s;ion a burning fever, to which the inhabitants are &s;ubject, and which they cure by regimen, drinking much water, and bathing in the river: in other re&s;pects, they are &s;trong and healthy. Old men are numerous, and many ride on hor&s;eback at eighty. The food they eat in the hot &s;ea&s;on, much contributes to the pre&s;er|vation of their health; it is chiefly vegetables, pul&s;e, and milk. They bathe frequently, eat little, &s;eldom drink fermented liquors, and mix much lemon juice in their food. This ab&s;tinence, pre&s;erves vigour to a very advanced age.</P>
<P>The North wind, in &s;ummer, continually blows, and finding no ob&s;tacle throughout all Egypt, where the mountains are not high, it drives the vapours of the mar&s;hes and lakes towards Aby&s;inia, and ince&s;&s;antly changes the atmo&s;phere. Perhaps, the bal&s;amic ema|nations of orange flowers, ro&s;es, the Arabian ja&s;mine, and odorous plants, contribute to the &s;alubrity of the air. The waters of the Nile, al&s;o ligther and &s;ofter, and more agreeable to the ta&s;te, than any other, greatly in|fluence the health of the inhabitants. All antiquity ac|knowledges their excellence; and the people certainly
<PB N="254" REF="263">
drink them with a kind of avidity, without being ever injured by the quantity. The Egyptians, &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;|tides,</HI> are the only people who pre&s;erve the water of the Nile, in &s;ealed va&s;es, and drink it when it is old, with the &s;ame plea&s;ure as we do old wine. Being lightly impregnated with nitre, they are only a gentle aperient to tho&s;e who take them to exce&s;s. I will not, &s;ays <HI>Sa|vary,</HI> with many writers, make believe, they render the women prolific, and give &s;trength and plumpne&s;s to the men; the faithful hi&s;torian ought to &s;top where the marvellous begins, and relate only what he can war|rant.</P>
<P>In lower Egypt, the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, the large lakes and the abundance of the waters mode|rate the &s;un's heat, and pre&s;erve a delightful tempera|ture. <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> who long lived here, did not think the country unhealthy.</P>
<P>They have prai&s;ed its fruitful &s;oil, its grateful pro|ductions, its &s;tately monuments, and its great popula|tion; without mentioning the dreadful maladies of which the moderns have made it the &s;eat. <HI>Herodolus</HI> po&s;itively &s;ays, "The Egyptians are the mo&s;t healthy people on earth; which advantage they owe to the &s;a|lubrity of the air, and the temperature of the climate, which &s;eldom varies; for mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of man, ought to be attributed to the rapid vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ea|&s;ons,"
<PB N="255" REF="264">
To &s;ome moderns, who have never &s;een this fine kingdom, and e&s;pecially to M. <HI>Paw,</HI> it was re|&s;erved to teach us a contrary doctrine. He pretends, that at pre&s;ent, "this country is become, by the neg|ligence of the Turks and Arabs, the cradle of the pe&s;|tilence; that another epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, equally dread|ful, appears here occa&s;ionally, brought to Cairo, by the caravans of Nubia; that the culture of rice en|genders numerous maladies; that the want of rain and thunder, occa&s;ions the air of the Thebais, to acquire a violence that ferments the humours of the body, &amp;c." The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions have an air of probability, which might impo&s;e on people who have not lived in Egypt; but M. <HI>Paw,</HI> has ventured opinions in his clo&s;et, with|out, the guidance of experience. Had he lived in this country, facts would have demon&s;trated the con|trary.</P>
<P>In vallies, inclo&s;ed by high mountains, where the atmo&s;phere is not continually renewed by a current of air, the culture of rice is unwhole&s;ome, and the hu&s;|bandman often pays with his life, the rich harve&s;t which the earth yields. But it is not the ca&s;e near Damietta and Ro&s;etta. The plains are nearly on a level with the &s;ea; neither hill nor height impede the refre&s;hing breezes of the North, which drives the clouds and ex|halations of the flooded fields &s;outhward, continually purifies the atmo&s;phere, and pre&s;erves the health of
<PB N="256" REF="265">
the people. Whether this, or any other be the cau&s;e, the hu&s;bandmen who cultivate the rice, are not more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, than tho&s;e of the Thebais, who do not. I pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the whole year amid rice-fields, which I every day went to &s;ee watered, without feeling the lea&s;t inconveniences. An old &s;urgeon, a native of Nice, and who had practi&s;ed thirty years at Damietta, has repeatedly confirmed what I have ad|vanced, on the healthine&s;s of the country. The great|e&s;t torments to the inhabitants, are the gnats and mu&s;|quitoes, which, ri&s;ing by millions out of the mar&s;hes, &s;warm in the air and the hou&s;es. The handkerchief mu&s;t be held in the hand all day. It is the fir&s;t thing a vi&s;itor receives, and, at night, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;leep under mu&s;quiteros.</P>
<P>The Southerly winds are known in Egypt, by the general name of <HI>winds of fifty days,</HI> not that they blow fifty days from the South without intermi&s;&s;ion; but, becau&s;e they prevail more frequently in the fifty days preceding, and following the equinox. Travellers have mentioned them under the denomination of poi&s;onous winds; or more correctly, hot winds of the de&s;art. Such, in fact, is their quality, and their heat &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that it is difficult to form an idea of its violence, without having experienced it; but it may be compared to the heat of a large oven, at the mo|ment of drawing out of the bread. When the&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="266">
winds begin to blow, the atmo&s;phere a&s;&s;umes an alarm|ing a&s;pect. The &s;ky, at other times &s;o clear in this climate, becomes dark and hoary; the &s;un lo&s;es its &s;plendor, and appears of a violet colour. The air is not cloudy, but grey and thick; and is, in fact, filled with an extremely &s;ubtle du&s;t, which penetrates every where. This wind, always light and rapid, is not at fir&s;t remarkably hot; but it increa&s;es in heat, in pro|portion to its continuance. All animals &s;oon di&s;cover it by the change it produces in them. The lungs, which a too refined air no longer expands, are con|tracted, and become painful. Re&s;piration is &s;hort and difficult; the &s;kin is parched and dry, and the body con&s;umed by an internal heat. In vain is re|cour&s;e had to large draughts of water; nothing can re|&s;tore per&s;piration. In vain is coolne&s;s &s;ought for in tho&s;e bodies, in which it is u&s;ual to find it. Marble, iron, water, though the &s;un no longer appears, are hot. The &s;treets are de&s;erted, and a dead &s;ilence reigns every where. The inhabitants of towns and villages, &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es; and tho&s;e of the de&s;art, in their tents, or in wells dug in the earth, where they wait the termination of this de&s;truc|tive heat. It u&s;ually la&s;ts three days, but if it ex|ceeds that time, it becomes in&s;upportable. Woe to the traveller whom this wind &s;urpri&s;es far from &s;helter. The danger is mo&s;t imminent, when it blows in &s;qualls, for then the rapidity of the wind increa&s;es the heat to &s;uch
<PB N="258" REF="267">
a degree, as to cau&s;e &s;udden death. This wind is e&s;pecially de&s;tructive to per&s;ons of a plethoric habit; and tho&s;e, in whom fatigue has de&s;troyed the tone of the mu&s;cles and ve&s;&s;els. The corp&s;e remains a long time warm, &s;wells, turns blue, and is ea&s;ily &s;eparated; all which are &s;igns of that putrid fermentation, which takes place when the humours become &s;tagnant. The&s;e accidents are to be avoided, by &s;topping the no&s;e and mouth with handkerchiefs; an efficacious method, likewi&s;e, is that practi&s;ed by the camels, which bury their no&s;es in the &s;and, and keep them there till the &s;quall is over.</P>
<P>Another quality of this wind, is its extreme aridity; which is &s;uch, that water &s;prinkled on the floor, eva|porates in a few minutes; by its extreme dryne&s;s, it withers and &s;trips all the plants, and by exhaling too &s;uddenly, the emanations from animal bodies, cri&s;ps the &s;kin, clo&s;es the pores, and cau&s;es that feveri&s;h heat which is the in&s;eparable attendant of ob&s;tructed per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>The&s;e hot winds are not peculiar to Egypt; they blow likewi&s;e in Syria; more frequently, however, near the &s;ea, and in the de&s;art, than in the mountains. <HI>Nieubuhr</HI> met with them in Arabia, at Bombay, and in the Diarbekir: they are al&s;o known in Per&s;ia, in the re&s;t of Africa, and even in Spain; every where their ef|fects
<PB N="259" REF="268">
are &s;imilar, but their direction varies according to the &s;ituation of the country. In Egypt, the mo&s;t violent proceed from the South-South-We&s;t; at Mecca from the Ea&s;t; at Surat from the North; at Ba&s;&s;ora from the North-We&s;t; from the We&s;t at Bagdad; and in Syria from the South-Ea&s;t. The&s;e varieties, which &s;eem embarra&s;&s;ing at fir&s;t &s;ight, on re|flection, furni&s;h the means of &s;olving the enigma. We find on examination, that the&s;e winds always proceed from de&s;art continents; and, in fact, it is natural that the air which covers the immen&s;e plains of Lybia and Arabia, meeting there neither with rivulets, nor lakes, nor fore&s;ts, but &s;corched by the rays of a burning &s;un and the reflection of the &s;and, &s;hould acquire a prodigious degree of heat and aridity. It is &s;o true, that the&s;e qualities are owing to the action of the &s;un upon the &s;ands; that the&s;e &s;ame winds produce not the &s;ame effects at every &s;ea&s;on. In Egypt, for ex|ample, the Southerly winds in December and January, are very cold; and, the rea&s;on is, that the &s;un having reached the Southern tropic, no longer burns up the Northern parts of Africa; and that Aby&s;inia, which is extremely mountainous, is covered with &s;now. From a &s;imilar rea&s;on, the South wind has much le&s;s effect in Cyprus; where it arrives cooled by the vapours of the Mediterranean. In fact, this &s;ubject offers a mul|titude of problems, calculated to excite the curio&s;ity of the naturali&s;t. In Italy they are called the Sirroc winds.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="269">To de&s;cribe Egypt in a few words, let the reader imagine, on one &s;ide, a narrow &s;ea and rocks; (the Red Sea) on the other immen&s;e plains of &s;and; and in the middle, a river flowing through a valley of one hundred and fifty leagues in length, and from three to &s;even wide; which, at the di&s;tance of thirty leagues from the &s;ea, &s;eparates into two arms; the branches of which wander over a &s;oil free from ob&s;tacle, and almo&s;t without declivity.</P>

But the manner of travelling here, is ill adapted to pro|mote &s;uch re&s;earches. It is not the &s;ame in this country as in Europe; travels there, are agreeable excur&s;ions; in Egypt, they are dangerous and diffi|cult undertakings, e&s;pecially for Europeans; whom the &s;uper&s;titious natives believe to be &s;orcerers, who are come to di&s;cover by magic, tho&s;e trea&s;ures which the geniis have concealed under the ruins. This ri|diculous, but deep-rooted opinion, added to perpetual wars and di&s;turbances, deprives the traveller of &s;e|curity, and prevents every di&s;covery. No one dares even to walk alone in the fields; nor can he procure any per&s;on to accompany him. The ba&s;is of all Egypt, is a continued bed of calcareous &s;tone, of a
<PB N="261" REF="270">
whiti&s;h hue, and &s;omewhat &s;oft, containing &s;hells ana|logous to tho&s;e found in the neighbouring &s;eas. Mar|ble, likewi&s;e, is found at the foot of the mountains, bordering on the Red Sea. Copper is the only metal of this country, mentioned by the ancients. On the road to Suez, is the greate&s;t quantity of what are called Egyptian flints, or pebbles; there, likewi&s;e, tho&s;e &s;tones have been found, which, from their form, were taken for petrified wood.</P>
<P>The two lakes of Natron, &s;ituated to the We&s;t of the Delta, are more intere&s;ting objects. Their bed is a &s;ort of natural trench, three or four leagues long, by a quarter wide, the bottom of which is &s;olid and &s;tony. It is dry for nine months in the year; but in winter, there oozes from the earth, a water of a red|di&s;h violet colour, which fills the lake to the height of five or &s;ix feet; the return of the great heats, cau&s;ing this to evaporate, there remains a bed of &s;alt two feet thick, and very hard, which is broken with bars of iron. Thirty thou&s;and quintals are produced from them every year. This phenomenon, which indicates a &s;oil impregnated with &s;alt, is common throughout all Egypt. Even when the gardens are overflowed, for the &s;ake of watering them, the &s;urface of the ground, after the evaporation of the water, appears glazed over with &s;alt.</P>

Its blacki&s;h colour, its clayey cementing quality, demon&s;trate its foreign origin; and, in fact, it is brought by the river from the heart of Aby&s;inia. Without this fat and light mud, Egypt never could have produced any thing; that alone &s;eems to contain the &s;eeds of vegetation and fecun|dity: and the&s;e again are owing to the river, by which it is depo&s;ited.</P>

But the political philo&s;opher will con|&s;ider it in a light more worthy of his attention, &s;hould he di&s;cover in the climate, production and population of Egypt, the means by which it has been rendered &s;o celebrated. Tho&s;e advantages, which ages cannot de&s;troy, and which have re&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t revolu|tions, will appear to him preferable to &s;uch as, like chymical compo&s;itions, are to be decompo&s;ed by the contrary proce&s;s to that by which they are pro|duced.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272">Such have been, no doubt, tho&s;e kingdoms, the memory of which has been pre&s;erved by hi&s;tory, though geography can &s;carcely point out the &s;ituation of their capitals.

<P>Wherever the inundation can reach, habitations are erected on little hills, rai&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, and which are contrived to take up as little room as po&s;|&s;ible, that they may &s;ave all the ground they can for cultivation.</P>
<P>The villages are always &s;urrounded by an infinite number of pointed turrets, to invite thither the pigeons, in order to collect their dung.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the River Nile.</HEAD>
<P>EGYPT has but one river, and on which its whole phy&s;ical and political exi&s;tence depends. It is the Nile that provides for the nece&s;&s;aries of animal life; the want of which is, &s;o frequently and &s;o di&s;tre&s;sfully, experienced in warm climates. The Nile alone, with|out the aid of rain, every where &s;upplies vegetation with moi&s;ture; the earth, during the three months in|undation, imbibing a &s;ufficient quantity of water for the re&s;t of the year. Were it not for this overflowing, only a very &s;mall part of the country could be culti|vated, and even that would require prodigious la|bour; it is with rea&s;on, therefore, it has been &s;tiled the &s;ource of plenty, happine&s;s, and even of life it&s;elf. Had <HI>Albuquerque</HI> been able to execute his project, of turning its cour&s;e into the Red Sea; this country, now &s;o rich and fertile, would have become a &s;avage de&s;art, &s;urrounded by &s;olitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="275">It is with rea&s;on, that the Egyptians have always profe&s;&s;ed a religious veneration for the Nile; but a European mu&s;t be pardoned, if, on hearing them boa&s;t its beauty, he &s;miles at their ignorance. Never will the&s;e troubled and muddy waters, have for him the charm of tran&s;parent fountains, and limpid &s;treams; never, except from &s;ome extraordinary excitement, will a &s;warthy Egyptian woman, dripping from the&s;e yellow and muddy waters, remind him of the bathing Naiads. For &s;ix months of the year, the water of the Nile is &s;o thick, that it mu&s;t have time to &s;ettle before it can be drank; and, during the three months which precede the inundation, reduced to an incon&s;iderable depth, it grows heated, becomes green, foetid, and full of worms; and, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to that which has been before drawn and pre&s;erved in ci&s;|terns. At all times, people of delicacy take care to perfume it, and cool it by evaporation.</P>
<P>Earthen ve&s;&s;els, unglazed, are kept carefully in every apartment, from whence the water continually tran&s;pires; this tran&s;piration produces the more coolne&s;s, in proportion as it is more con&s;iderable; for this rea&s;on, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are often &s;u&s;pended in pa&s;&s;ages, where are currents of air, and under the &s;hade of trees. In &s;everal parts of Syria, they drink the water which has tran&s;pired; in Egypt, they drink that which remains; be&s;ides, in no country is &s;o much
<PB N="267" REF="276">
water u&s;ed. The fir&s;t thing that an Egyptian does on entering his hou&s;e, is to lay hold of the pitcher of water, and take a hearty draught of it, and thanks to their perpetual per&s;piration, they feel no inconve|nience from the practice.</P>
<P>This river, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> the &s;ources of which are not known, receiving all the &s;treams with which Aby&s;&s;inia and Ethiopia are abundantly watered, de&s;cends into Egypt, which it cro&s;&s;es from South to North, to about four leagues below Cairo; where, dividing it&s;elf into two branches, it forms the i&s;land, &s;o celebrated and well known by the name of Delta: it is &s;aid, he adds, that a traveller of the name of <HI>Bruce,</HI> has pretended to have di&s;covered the &s;ource of the Nile. I &s;aw at Cairo, the &s;ervant who was his guide, and the com|panion of his journey, who a&s;&s;ured me, he had no knowledge of any &s;uch di&s;covery. It may, perhaps, be objected, that a learned man like <HI>Bruce,</HI> was not obliged to give an account of his di&s;coveries to his valet; but, in a de&s;art, remarks <HI>Tott,</HI> the pride of ce|lebrity vani&s;hes. The ma&s;ter and &s;ervant di&s;appear, and become only two men, nece&s;&s;itated to a&s;&s;i&s;t their mutual wants; the only &s;uperiority is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;tronge&s;t; and the &s;ervant I have mentioned, born in the country, would certainly have corroborated <HI>Bruce</HI>'s a&s;&s;ertions, in a di&s;covery merely typogra|phical.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="277">That the Nile ri&s;es in Ethiopia, admits not of a doubt; but, whether <HI>Bruce,</HI> or the Portugeu&s;e je&s;uits of the la&s;t century, have been able to a&s;certain that particular fountain, which is indi&s;putably the head, &s;eems not &s;o very clear. It does not appear, that any of the&s;e travellers have traced its cour&s;e, &s;tep by &s;tep, from its &s;ource to its mouth. <HI>Savary</HI> &s;ays, the Aby|&s;inians, who bring gold du&s;t to Grand Cairo, are una|nimous in a&s;&s;erting, that this river, taking its ri&s;e in Ethiopia, divides into two branches; one of which, known by the name of A&s;&s;erac, or the blue river, joins the Niger; and, traver&s;ing Africa from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, falls into the Atlantic ocean: and that, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> North, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Medi|terranean This, we believe, is denied by <HI>Bruce;</HI> but of this matter we &s;hall treat more fully, when we &s;peak of Aby&s;inia, where its &s;ource undoubtedly is.</P>
<P>The periodical inundation of this river, in a coun|try where it &s;carcely ever rains, and which the heat of the climate, and the very nature of the &s;oil, &s;eem to have devoted to perpetual drought and &s;terility, is a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing phenomenon, and which, more particu|larly de&s;erves to be noticed.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of the Nile begins early in June, but is not much perceived till the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice; when the waters become troubled, are of a reddi&s;h tincture,
<PB N="269" REF="278">
and are thought unwhole&s;ome. They mu&s;t be pu|rified before they are drank, which is done by mixing bitter almonds, pounded to du&s;t, in a jar full of water, and kept turning with the arm for &s;ome minutes; it is then left to &s;ettle, and in five or &s;ix hours, the hetero|geneous particles &s;ub&s;ide to the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, and the water becomes limpid and excellent. The Egyptians attribute this fermentation of the Nile, to the dew, which then falls in abundance. Many hi&s;|torians have &s;eriou&s;ly affirmed, it contributed to the inundations. It is much more natural to think, that the river overflowing in Aby&s;inia and Ethiopia, brings down a great quantity of &s;and, and millions of the eggs of in&s;ects; which, hatching about the time of the &s;ol|&s;tice, produce the fermentation of the waters, and that reddi&s;h tincture which renders them unhealthy.</P>
<P>The Nile continues encrea&s;ing till near the end of Augu&s;t, and often even in September. The progre&s;s of the inundation, is ob&s;erved at the Nilometer; and public criers di&s;tributed in each quarter of Grand Cairo, the capital, every day make known to the peo|ple, the ri&s;ing of the waters, till they are come to the height proper for opening the canal, by which they are conveyed to the middle of the city, and the ci&s;|terns. The Nilometer, is &s;ituated at the Southern point of the I&s;land of Raouda; it is a column erected
<PB N="270" REF="279">
in the center of a low chamber, the bottom of which is on a level with the bed of the Nile.</P>
<P>As Egypt pays no tribute to the Grand Signior, if the waters do not ri&s;e to &s;ixteen cubits; the Egyptians often di&s;gui&s;e the truth, and do not proclaim they have ri&s;en to that height till they have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed it. When they are under &s;ixteen cubits, a famine is dreaded; the years of abundance, are tho&s;e between eighteen and twenty-two cubits. When the waters exceed this, they lay too long on the ground, and prevent its being &s;own; on the contrary, inundations below the medium, often leave the high lands fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>The river, at this time, &s;preading it&s;elf over the country, on each &s;ide of its bed for &s;everal leagues, appears like a &s;ea; whatever parts lay &s;o remote, as to be out of the reach of the inundation, are watered by canals; &s;o much is expended in its cour&s;e, that it has been conjectured, not a tenth part of the water r&eacute;aches the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The appearance which Egypt pre&s;ents at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, mu&s;t be very &s;ingular and curious, to one who a&s;cends a high building, and di&s;covers a va&s;t ex|pan&s;e of water all around, with towns and villages ri&s;ing out of the flood; here and there a cau&s;eway, and numberle&s;s groves and fruit-trees, who&s;e tops only are vi&s;ible. When the waters retire, they leave a
<PB N="271" REF="280">
va&s;t quantity of fi&s;h on the land; and, at the &s;ame time, what is much more valuable, a &s;lime, which acts as manure, and fertilizes the fields. By this annual addition of &s;oil, Egypt has been very much rai&s;ed and enlarged in the cour&s;e of years, and many places are now inland, which were formerly clo&s;e to the &s;ea, &s;uch particularly, is Damietta; and, as the mud of the Nile extends for &s;ome leagues into the &s;ea, and accu|mulates every year, this country, by little and little, annually increa&s;es.</P>
<P>The day of proclamation for opening the canals, is a day of rejoicing, and a &s;olemn fea&s;t among the Egyp|tians. The pacha and his whole court de&s;cend from the ca&s;tle, and go in pomp to Fo&s;tat; where the canal begins that runs through Grand Cairo. He places him&s;elf under a magnificent pavillion erected there. The boys, with their mu&s;icians playing before him, and their mamluks following, are his attendants. The chief prie&s;ts ride hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned; and all the inhabitants, on hor&s;eback, on foot, and in boats, ha&s;ten to be pre&s;ent at this ceremony. More than three hundred thou&s;and people a&s;&s;emble on land and water. The boats, mo&s;t of them painted and carved, have canopies and &s;treamers of various colours. Tho&s;e of the women, are known by their elegance, richne&s;s, and the gilt columns that &s;upport the ca|nopy, and particularly by the blinds let down before
<PB N="272" REF="281">
the windows. The people all remain &s;ilent, till the moment the pacha gives the &s;ignal, and then, in&s;tantly &s;houts of joy rend the air; the trumpets &s;ound their flouri&s;hes, and the kettle-drums, and other in&s;truments, reverberate on all &s;ides. Certain men throw down the &s;tatue of clay, which was placed on the mound, which &s;tatue is called, <HI>The betrothed,</HI> and is the re|mains of an ancient rite among the Egyptians, who con&s;ecrated a virgin to the Nile; and whom, in times of dearth, they &s;ometimes threw into the waters. The mound, or dam, is pre&s;ently de&s;troyed; and the waters no longer meeting an ob&s;tacle, flow towards Grand Cairo. The pacha throws gold and &s;ilver coins into the &s;tream, which good &s;wimmers immediately dive for, and bring up. The inhabitants appear intoxicated with joy; they congratulate, and pay compliments to each other all day; and &s;ongs of thank&s;giving are every where heard. A number of female dancers a&s;&s;emble on the banks of the <HI>Khalig,</HI> (canal) and regale the &s;pectators with their la&s;civious dances. All is mirth and good cheer, and the very poor them&s;elves fea&s;t. This univer&s;al rejoicing is not &s;urpri&s;ing: the fate of the country depends on the inundation, and when it arrives, all behold the hopes of harve&s;t, the picture of plenty, and anticipate the promi&s;ed good with tran&s;port.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="282">The evenings pre&s;ent a &s;pectacle &s;till more agree|able. All the great &s;quares of the city are floated; and the families a&s;&s;emble in boats, adorned with ta|pe&s;try, rich cu&s;hions, and every convenience luxuri|ous ea&s;e can wi&s;h. The &s;treets, mo&s;ques, and mina|rets, are illuminated: they row from &s;quare to &s;quare, taking with them fruits and refre&s;hments. This mo&s;t numerous a&s;&s;embly, is u&s;ually at Le&s;behia, which is the large&s;t &s;quare in the city, and near half a league in circumference; it forms an immen&s;e ba&s;on, &s;ur|rounded by the palaces of the beys, which are em|belli&s;hed with various coloured lights. Many thou|&s;ands of boats, to the ma&s;ts of which lamps are &s;u&s;|pended, produce an ever-varying illumination. The clear and &s;tarry heavens, which there are &s;eldom ob|&s;cured by mi&s;ts, and the profu&s;ion of atrificial lights on the waters, give all the brilliancy of day, to the &s;weet refre&s;hing coolne&s;s of night. Imagine, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the plea&s;ure with which the people, who have been &s;corched twelve hours by a &s;un &s;o ardent, come and breathe the cool air of the&s;e lakes: &s;eldom are the charms of this nocturnal &s;eene di&s;turbed by impetu|ous winds; they fall at &s;un-&s;et, and gentler airs agi|tate the atmo&s;phere. The charms of female &s;ociety, are, however, here procured with difficulty. Men a&s;|&s;ociate only with men, and women with women.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="283">The lamps are obliged to be always kept lighted; this is a precaution nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;afety, which the Oualli, who goes from place to place, takes care to &s;ee punctually ob&s;erved. If this officer, who &s;uperintends the police, finds a boat without light, he is ju&s;tified in beheading all the per&s;ons on board; and, unle&s;s a &s;uitable pre&s;ent re&s;trains the arms of the executioners who accompany him, he in&s;tantly and ri|gorou&s;ly executes the &s;entence.</P>
<P>All the de&s;criptions of Egypt have hitherto agreed to con&s;ider the mud, which the water acquires during its increa&s;e, and at length depo&s;its on the inundated lands, as a manure by which they are fertilized. No vegetative quality, however, is di&s;coverable, in ana|lizing it, before its union with the &s;and; which, to|gether with the clay, compo&s;es the &s;oil of Egypt.</P>
<P>The Nile, notwith&s;tanding the agitation of its waters, is &s;o ea&s;y to confine, that many fields lower than the &s;urface of the river, are pre&s;erved during its increa&s;e, from an inundation de&s;tructive to their productions, merely by a dam of moi&s;tened earth, not more than eight or ten inches in thickne&s;s.</P>
<P>This method, which co&s;ts the cultivator but little trouble, is made u&s;e of to pre&s;erve the Delta, when it is threatened by the flood. This i&s;land, which an|nually
<PB N="275" REF="284">
produces three harve&s;ts, is continually watered by machines, con&s;tructed on the Nile, and on the canals cut through the i&s;land, but it rarely is in danger of being overflowed; and this rich part of Egypt, which extends to the &s;ea, would be &s;till le&s;s affected by the &s;welling of the river, did not the wind, blowing a long time in one quarter, rai&s;e the waters of the Me|diterranean toward the South.</P>
<P>It was without doubt, to provide again&s;t tho&s;e years, when the Nile does not overflow a great part of the country, that the ancient &s;overeigns of Egypt cut &s;o many canals; the principal of which are &s;till kept in order, but the greater part neglected, and con&s;equently one half of Egypt is deprived of cultivation. Tho&s;e which convey the water to Cairo, to the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are mo&s;t attended to by government. An officer is appointed to watch this la&s;t, and hinder the Arabs of Bachria, who receive the &s;uperfluous waters of this canal, from turning them off before Alexandria be provided; or opening it before the time fixed, which would hinder the increa&s;e of the Nile. That which conveys the water into the province of Fayoom, is watched in like manner, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, (which is called the canal of Trajan) be filled.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="285">A number of other canals, only taken care of by tho&s;e who derive advantage from them, i&s;&s;ue from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fer|tilize the province of Sharkia; which, making part of the i&s;thmus of Suez, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of Egypt, and the mo&s;t capable of a great increa&s;e of cultiva|tion. The plains of Gaza, which lie beyond, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Arabs, would not be le&s;s fertile, if the &s;pirit of deva&s;tation did not de&s;troy, even the &s;pon|taneous productions. Many other canals run through the i&s;le of Delta, &s;ome of which are navigable, and render its culture equal to that of a well-managed kitchen-garden.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that the Delta, more elevated than the re&s;t of Egypt, is bounded towards the &s;ea, by a fore&s;t of palm-trees; the land of which is much higher than the highe&s;t ri&s;ing of the waters; and this topographical remark, according to <HI>Volney,</HI> is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the &s;y&s;tem of the forma|tion of the Delta, by &s;ediment. A country, which ri&s;es higher than the highe&s;t inundations, can never owe to them its origin. Such &s;ediment can only oc|ca&s;ion, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> the divi&s;ion of the two branches of the Nile. Very re&s;pectable authorities have laboured to prove, that the Delta has been formed from the &s;ediment of the Nile; particularly &s;ome of the fir&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="286">
writers of antiquity, who are not &s;o apt to err as the moderns.</P>
<P>The degrees of inundation are not the &s;ame through all Egypt. On the contrary, a gradual diminution obtains, as the river approaches the &s;ea. At Syene, the overflow is more con&s;iderable by one &s;ixth, than at Grand Cairo; and when the depth of water, at this latter city, is twenty-&s;even feet, it is &s;carcely four at Ro&s;etta and Damietta. The rea&s;on of this is, that, be&s;ides the quantity of water ab&s;orbed by the grounds, as it flows, the river confined in one &s;ingle bed, and within a narrow valley, ri&s;es higher in the upper country; but when it has pa&s;&s;ed Grand Cairo, being no longer ob&s;tructed by the mountains, and &s;eparating into a thou&s;and branches, it nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;es in depth what it acquires in &s;urface.</P>
<P>This river runs a cour&s;e of fifteen hundred miles, from South to North; and, dividing as we have before ob&s;erved, a little below Cairo, into two branches, falls into the Mediterranean, at about one hundred miles di&s;tant from each other.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two principal branches, &s;ays <HI>Rooke,</HI> go &s;everal others, inter&s;ecting the country that lies between; and this bounteous river, after &s;cattering plenty over the land, during a cour&s;e of many hun|dred
<PB N="278" REF="287">
miles, empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea by &s;even mouths. The two mo&s;t con&s;iderable, are tho&s;e of Damietta and Ro&s;etta, the former was the <HI>O&s;tium Pathmeticum</HI> of the antients; the latter, the <HI>O&s;tium Bolbitinum.</HI></P>
<P>At Grand Cairo, it does not appear that the Nile is much broader than the Thames is at London, and in many parts near this city it is even fordable. In the upper parts of this river, are &s;even cataracts, where the Nile falls from a very great height, with a prodigious roaring; but, in lower Egypt, the &s;tream glides along gently, and pa&s;&s;engers are &s;eldom ob&s;truct|ed on it by &s;torms.</P>
<P>The banks of this river, as well as tho&s;e of all the canals, are crouded with va&s;t numbers of pea&s;ants, continually employed in watering the country, either by their own labour, or the management of tho&s;e ani|mals which relieve it. An infinite number of draw-wells, worked with a wheel, are contrived for this pur|po&s;e; the waters, which are rai&s;ed, are poured into a channel, and di&s;tributed among the grounds, at a di&s;tance from the river, by various canals; which the indu&s;try and activity of the cultivator, prepare with intelligence and economy. Women, occupied with the care of their families, are &s;een carrying home water, in jars, upon their heads; others wa&s;h their linen, bleach that which is newly made, &s;pread it out,
<PB N="279" REF="288">
and give them&s;elves up to that chearfulne&s;s and gaiety &s;o natural to them, on every occa&s;ion; making the air re&s;ound with their &s;hrill voices, the <HI>ulululatus</HI> of the Romans. The barges, which pa&s;s from one city to another, the boats employed in the conveyance of commodities, and the navigation which commerce maintains, add to the variety and motion of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This navigation, is principally remarkable for the agility of the watermen, and the manner in which they convey the pottery-ware, made in higher Egypt. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, before this is explained, to ob|&s;erve, that the earthen pans, made to pre&s;erve water, ought to be bigger, the farther tho&s;e, for who&s;e u&s;e they are intended, dwell from the river; and as the inhabitants of lower Egypt, re&s;ide at the greater di&s;tance, the potters, who dwell in the higher, con|trive the rafts accordingly by which they convey their wares. The large&s;t jars, fa&s;tened by their handles, form the fir&s;t row of the raft; the middle &s;ized are placed next, and the lea&s;t uppermo&s;t; the proprietor contrives for him&s;elf a convenient &s;tation, and, fur|ni&s;hed with a long pole, commits him&s;elf to the cour&s;e of the waters, without fearing to run a-ground on a &s;oft clay, which can do no damage.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Agriculture, and Manner of rai&s;ing Seed.</HEAD>
<P>AGRICULTURE was honourable among the ancient Egyptians, which they had rendered mo&s;t flouri&s;hing throughout their empire; witne&s;s their immen&s;e labours for di&s;tributing the waters over the lands. There are &s;till eighty canals, like rivers; &s;everal of which are twenty, thirty, and forty leagues in length; receiving and di&s;tributing the inundation over the country. Except &s;ix, the others are almo&s;t filled up and dry, when the Nile is low. The grand lakes of Maeris, Behira, and Mareotis, were va&s;t re|&s;ervoirs, to contain the &s;uperabundant waters, and af|terwards to di&s;per&s;e them in the plains. They were rai&s;ed over the high lands, by chain buckets; the in|vention of which is due to the Egyptians. One ox can turn them, and water a va&s;t field. The&s;e ma|chines gave <HI>Archimedes</HI> the idea of his ingenious &s;crew, which is &s;till in u&s;e. Be&s;ides the&s;e re&s;ervoirs, all the towns, at a little di&s;tance from the Nile, are &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="281" REF="290">
by &s;pacious ponds, for the convenience of the inhabitants, and of agriculture. The remains we find of large mounds, were to contain the river; they al&s;o &s;topped the torrents of &s;and.</P>
<P>Twelve hundred years has this country been &s;ub|ject to a people, who have &s;uffered the&s;e great works to peri&s;h. The limits of cultivated Egypt yearly de|crea&s;e, and &s;terile lands every where accumulate. Po|pulation has equally &s;uffered: ancient Egypt &s;upplied food to eight millions of inhabitants: at pre&s;ent, the e&s;timate is not one half.</P>
<P>The lands all belong to the chiefs, which they &s;ell to individuals. When the proprietor dies, it de&s;cends to the &s;on, but he is obliged to purcha&s;e his father's inheritance; nor is he certain of obtaining it; the highe&s;t bidder becomes the proprietor. Who will improve lands, which he cannot tran&s;mit to his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or? The farmer wanting only a livelihood, leaves part of his grounds untilled. The labours of agri|culture are very light to what they are in other coun|tries. The ox having made a &s;light furrow, the field is hoed and levelled like a garden; and, when &s;owed, &s;lightly harrowed, and here ends the labour of the hu&s;bandman, till harve&s;t, which is abundant in the ex|treme, and never fails but with the inundation. The corn and barley, ripe, are reaped, and laid on the
<PB N="282" REF="291">
floor; and the farmer, &s;eated in a cart with cutting wheels, and drawn by oxen blindfolded, drives over the &s;traw which it chops. The corn, winnowed, is yellow, large, and of exceeding good quality. The Egyptians eat red, half-baked bread; bad, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of wind and water-mills, they u&s;e a hand-mill, and do not &s;ufficiently &s;ift the flour. A French baker, made bread as white as &s;now, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> and ex|cellently ta&s;ted, with this &s;ame wheat.</P>
<P>Rice requires a little more care; the field mu&s;t be inundated, well cleared, and watered every day, which is done by chain-buckets. It is cut in five months, and the product is u&s;ually eighty bu&s;hels for one. Be&s;ides the&s;e grains, Egypt produces abun|dance of doura, or Indian millet; flax, formerly &s;o famous, hemp, carthamus, or ba&s;tard &s;affron; and multitudes of exqui&s;ite melons, and other vegetables, which the people eat during the heats.</P>
<P>Seed-time differs according to the province, and the height of the ground. Near Syene, wheat and barley are &s;own in October, and reaped in January. About Girja the harve&s;t month is February; and in March, round Grand Cairo: &s;uch is the general pro|gre&s;s of the harve&s;t through the Said. There are many exceptions, according as the lands are, high or low, more or le&s;s di&s;tant from the river. They &s;ow
<PB N="283" REF="292">
and reap all the year in Egypt, wherever they can ob|tain the water of the Nile. The land is never fallow, and yields three harve&s;ts annually; there the tra|veller ince&s;&s;antly beholds the charming pro&s;pect of flowers, fruits, corn and &s;pring. Summer and Au|tumn at once pre&s;ent their trea&s;ures. De&s;cending from the cataracts, at the begining of January, the wheat is &s;een almo&s;t ripe; farther on it is in ear; and &s;till farther the fields are green. Lucern is mowed three times, between November and March, and is the only hay there is in Egypt, and is u&s;ed chiefly to fodder cattle. Hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, mules and camels graze in the meadows, during winter; and they eat chopped &s;traw, barley and beans; which kind of food gives health, &s;trength and mettle. The Arabs accu&s;|tom their hor&s;es to great ab&s;tinence, water them only once a day. and feed them with a little barley and milk.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, who &s;eldom cultivate the olive, buy their oil in Crete and Syria; but as the love of illumination has de&s;cended to them, from their fore|fathers, they extract oil from various plants; the com|mone&s;t is the produce of the <HI>&s;e&s;amum;</HI> they call it lamp oil. They al&s;o extract it from the &s;eed of the carthamus, from flax, popies, and lettuce. The oil of the carthamus is eaten by the common people.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="293">Their manner of rai&s;ing bees is not a little extra|ordinary, and be&s;peaks great ingenuity. Upper Egypt, pre&s;erving its verdure only four or five months, the flowers and harve&s;ts being &s;een no longer, the people of Lower Egypt profit from this circum|&s;tance, by a&s;&s;embling on board large boats, the bees of different villages. Each proprietor confides his hives, with his own mark, to the boatman; who, when loaded, gently proceeds up the river, and &s;tops at every place where he finds verdure and flowers. The bees &s;warm from their cells at break of day, and col|lect their nectar, returning, &s;everal times, loaded with booty; and in the evening re-enter their hives, with|out ever mi&s;taking their abode. Thus, &s;ojourning three months on the Nile, the bees, having extracted the perfumes of the orange flowers of the Said, the e&s;&s;ence of the ro&s;es of Fayoum, the &s;weets of the Arabian ja&s;min, and of every flower, are brought back to their homes, where they find new riches. The proprietors pay the boatmen, on their return, ac|cording to the number of hives they have taken, from one end of Egypt to the other.</P>
<P>Having now given a general view of the face of the country, climate and productions, we proceed to treat of the different cities, beginning fir&s;t with tho&s;e in Lower Egypt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="285" REF="294">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Cities, Grand Cairo, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE cities in Egypt are all &s;ituated on the Nile, or the great canals; the hou&s;es are built of brick, &s;everal &s;tories high, and in a ta&s;te &s;imilar to that in vogue, two or three hundred years ago, in the great cities of Europe. The palm-trees, which &s;urround the Egyptian cities, and the ve&s;&s;els which line the banks of the Nile, or the canals on which they are built, add to the beauty of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It is by uniting agriculture with commerce, that all the cities of Egypt incite, encourage, and profit by the indu&s;try which encircles them; but the advan|tages which Grand Cairo enjoys, are not confined to the intere&s;ts of Egypt alone; its commerce embraces both the hemi&s;pheres; and its &s;treets are continually crowded with camels, which bring the merchandize of Egypt, and the Indies; and piled with bales of goods, from Madras and Mar&s;eilles; &s;o that Grand Cairo appears to be the centre of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295">This city, called by the Arabs Mi&s;&s;ir, is &s;ituated on the right &s;ide of the Nile; about half a league from the river. It is adjoining to the mountains of Ara|bia; at the we&s;tern angle of the&s;e mountains, the ca&s;tle of Old Cairo is built. Boulac, the port of Old Cairo, forms the &s;uburbs; and if the number of their inhabitants are added to that of the city, we &s;hall find a&s;&s;embled here, not le&s;s than &s;even hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons; a proof of the great number of the inhabitants in Egypt.</P>
<P>In the fifteenth century Grand Cairo was one of the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities in the world; the emporium of Europe and A&s;ia, and traded from the &s;traits of Gibraltar, to the furthe&s;t limits of India. The di&s;covery of the Cape of Good Hope, and the Ottoman conque&s;t, have deprived it of great part of its opulence and &s;plendor; yet, its admirable &s;ituation, and the fertility of Egypt, are advantages &s;o great, that, in a &s;pace of three leagues, it &s;till contains an in|finity of people, and immen&s;e riches.</P>
<P>The extent of Grand Cairo, along the principal canal, from North to South, is one league and a half; and three quarters of a league in breadth, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. Its whole circumference is be&s;t &s;een from a mount overlooking the city, by which it is half en|circled, like an immen&s;e cre&s;cent. The &s;treets are &s;o
<PB N="287" REF="296">
narrow and winding, &s;ome &s;carce admitting two per|&s;ons to walk a brea&s;t, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to follow their direction, amid&s;t the multitudes of hou&s;es, which &s;tand crouding on each other; va&s;t vacancies only can be di&s;tingui&s;hed; and there are &s;quares, which become ponds, in the time of inundation, and gardens the re&s;t of the year. They are rowed over in Sep|tember, and covered with flowers and verdures, in April.</P>
<P>The principal &s;treet in the city is called the Khaliz, or canal, being under water nine months in the year; it is, in many places, paved with marble; and, during the other three months, people walk along it, as they do in the other &s;treets. This &s;treet, or canal, is &s;aid to have been dry by order of one of the Pharaoh's. Previous to the inundation of the Nile, it is dammed up; and, when the river has ri&s;en to a certain height, broken down; on which the water in&s;tantly flows into the city; and, by le&s;&s;er canals, is communicated to the re&s;ervoirs, gardens, and adjacent country. All the cities of Egypt have canals to convey the waters of the Nile to them. This river ri&s;es to its greate&s;t height about Augu&s;t. In October it begins to de|crea&s;e. The criers then go about the city, to ac|quaint the inhabitants that the water-carrier can get no more water from the canal; as it is then no longer fit to be drank, and becomes &s;tagnant, from all kinds
<PB N="288" REF="297">
of na&s;tine&s;s being thrown into it. After it has cea&s;ed entirely to flow, the &s;tench is intolerable.</P>
<P>When the water is to be drained from the canal, it is divided, in &s;everal places, by the means of &s;mall dykes: above which they throw the water on both &s;ides, and cau&s;e it to run off by degrees. This is ge|nerally done in May. They afterwards &s;hovel up the mud; and, loading their a&s;&s;es with it, carry it into the fields. If this was not repeated every year, the canal, in a &s;hort time, would be &s;o full of mud, that the hou&s;es would be under water, during the time of the inundation.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it is evident, that in tho&s;e towns, which are at any di&s;tance from the Nile, the inhabitants have but very indifferent water, for drink|ing, the greate&s;t part of the year; it being only &s;uch as is pre&s;erved in their ponds and re&s;ervoirs, or what is brought to them by the Arabs, in goat-&s;kins, which is very indifferent.</P>
<P>Next to the Khaliz is the Bazar &s;treet; where, on market-days, there is &s;uch a concour&s;e of people col|lected, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s along. This is a very long and &s;pacious &s;treet; at one end of it is a Bezi&s;tan, where may be &s;een &s;hops as magnificent as any in Con&s;tantinople; at the other end is the &s;lave-market.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298">Grand Cairo contains near three hundred mo&s;ques; mo&s;t of them with minarets. The&s;e give an agree|able variety to a city, which, from the flatne&s;s of its roofs, appears uniform. Public cryers, at appointed hours, as in all towns of Turkey, call the people to prayers, from the&s;e minarets: about eight hundred voices are heard, at the &s;ame moment, from all quar|ters of the city, calling man to the performance of his duty to God. The Turks abhor the noi&s;e of bells, and &s;ay it offends the ears, is unmeaning, and proper only for bea&s;ts of burden. They derive this opinion from <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who, like a great politician, de&s;irous that all his in&s;titutions &s;hould have one ten|dency, and willing to captivate both the &s;en&s;es and under&s;tanding, rejected the trumpet of the Jews, and the rattle of the Oriental Chri&s;tians. He knew the human voice would make a greater impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of man, than the grating &s;ound of in&s;en&s;ible bra&s;s; and produced a holy &s;ummons, &s;ent by heaven, conformable to his views.</P>
<P>The circuit of this city, &s;ays <HI>Rooke,</HI> is &s;even miles; the hou&s;es extremely high, and the &s;treets very nar|row, not being wider than our alleys in London, and are always full of people, mo&s;t of them being mounted; the Turks of fa&s;hion on hor&s;eback; Chri&s;tians and Plebeians on jacka&s;&s;es. To the ex|treme height of the hou&s;es, they add every other con|trivance
<PB N="290" REF="299">
po&s;&s;ible, to exclude the &s;un; placing over, from the top of the hou&s;es on one &s;ide of the &s;treet, to tho&s;e of the other, canvas &s;trained on frames; whereby the &s;treets are very much darkened, and the &s;un totally excluded; one advantage in this hot country; but then, on the other hand, the air is, by that means, rendered clo&s;e and &s;offocating.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Cairo &s;tands on a &s;teep rock, and is &s;urrounded by thick walls, on which are &s;trong tow|ers. It was a place of great force before the in|vention of gunpowder; but, being commanded by the neighbouring mountains, it would not now &s;tand the fire of a battery erected there, two hours. It is more than a quarter of a league in circumference.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle includes the palaces of the Sultan of Egypt, now almo&s;t buried under their own ruins; domes overthrown, heaps of rubbi&s;h, gilding, and pictures, the colours of which have defied corroding time; &s;tately marble columns &s;till &s;tanding, but, in ge|neral, without capitals: &s;uch are the tokens of its former magnificence. In one of the halls of the&s;e ruinous buildings, the rich carpet is fabricated, which the Emir <HI>Hadji</HI> bears every year to Mecca, to cover the Caaba, or temple of <HI>Abraham,</HI></P>
<P>The pachas inhabit a large building, containing nothing remarkable, the windows of which look to|wards
<PB N="291" REF="300">
the &s;quare Caramaydan. The hall of audi|ence, where the divan a&s;&s;embles three times a week, is nearly as long, but not &s;o wide, as We&s;tmin&s;ter hall; and is &s;tained by the blood of the beys, ma&s;&s;a|cred, &s;ome years ago, by order of the Porte. The&s;e are, however, at pre&s;ent, the &s;overeigns of Egypt; for the Grand Signior's repre&s;entative is a phantom, with which they &s;port: they keep him to &s;erve their own purpo&s;es; then di&s;mi&s;s him with &s;hame. He cannot leave his palace, in which he is a pri&s;oner, without their permi&s;&s;ion. Thus humbled is the Ot|toman pride, thus feeble, and thus reduced is that em|pire, which threatened to en&s;lave Europe.</P>
<P>The mint is near Caramaydan, where a prodigious quantity of medins and &s;equins are &s;truck, with the die of the bey who governs the city. The &s;equins, worth about &s;ix &s;hillings and threepence, are made of the gold-du&s;t &s;upplied by the caravans of Aby&s;inia; which, the ma&s;ter of the mint declared, annually brought near one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Enriched and occupied with the commerce of Egypt by the Nile, of Europe by the Mediterranean, and of Yemen and the Indies by the Red Sea, the luxury which follows this exten&s;ive commerce is in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that gold is e&s;teemed com|mon,
<PB N="292" REF="301">
nor can the riche&s;t manufactures of India give &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s, well is among the things, the mo&s;t curious, the ca&s;tle contains. It is &s;unk in the rock, two hun|dred and twenty feet deep, and forty-two in circum|ference. It includes two excavations, not perpendi|cular to each other. A &s;tairca&s;e, the de&s;cent of which is exceedingly gentle, is carried round; the partition which &s;eparates the &s;tairca&s;e from the well, is part of the rock, left only &s;ix inches thick, with windows cut at intervals, to give light; but as they are &s;mall, and &s;ome of them low, it is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cend by the light of candles.</P>
<P>There is a re&s;ervoir, and a level &s;pace, at that part of the well where it takes a new direction; and oxen, which turn a machine that draws water from the bottom of the well. Other oxen, from above, rai&s;e it out of this re&s;ervoir, by a &s;imple machine. This water comes from the Nile, and as it has been filtrated through &s;and, impregnated with &s;alt and nitre, is bracki&s;h.</P>
<P>Thirty columns of red granite, being ruins of the palace of <HI>Salah Eddin,</HI> are &s;till &s;tanding: the &s;haft of each is forty-five feet high, and a &s;ingle &s;tone. The variations in their dimen&s;ions, and the ornaments
<PB N="293" REF="302">
&s;culptured round the capitals, be&s;peak their having been from more ancient monuments. Some di&s;tance from the&s;e beautiful columns is a delightful balcony, or pavillion, &s;tanding in the highe&s;t part of the cita|del, the pro&s;pect from which is mo&s;t exten&s;ive. The whole of Grand Cairo, with its multitudinous mo&s;ques and minarets, is &s;een at a view. Toward Boulac, fruitful fields, and rich harve&s;ts, inter&s;per&s;ed with groves of date-trees; on the South-we&s;t, Fo&s;tat, or Old Cairo, and the plains of Said beyond; which, when inundated by the Nile, contain hamlets &s;cattered up and down like i&s;lands. The land&s;cape is termi|nated by the pyramids, which, like painted mountains, appear lo&s;t in the clouds. The eye is never wearied with objects &s;o various and grand; the fre&s;h air breathed in this elevated &s;ituation, and the coolne&s;s it imparts, is an additional plea&s;ure. Seated in this de|lightful pavillion, how many agreeable thoughts ri&s;e in the mind; yet how &s;uddenly are the&s;e &s;weet medita|tions di&s;turbed by gloomy melancholy! Here, in the rich fields, arts and &s;ciences once flouri&s;hed, where now an ignorant and barbarous people trample them under foot. Tyranny, with its iron &s;ceptre, is become the &s;courge of the fir&s;t of countries, in which the mi|&s;eries of men &s;eem to increa&s;e, in proportion to the efforts of nature to render them happy!</P>
<P>When we hear of Grand Cairo, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> in his de&s;cription of this city, we are led to imagine it mu&s;t
<PB N="294" REF="303">
be a capital, like tho&s;e of Europe; but if we reflect that our cities have only begun to be rendered con|venient and elegant, within the&s;e la&s;t hundred years, we &s;hall ea&s;ily believe, that in a country where no|thing has been improved &s;ince the tenth century, they mu&s;t partake of the common barbari&s;m; and, indeed, we &s;hall find that Cairo contains none of tho&s;e pub|lic, or private edifices, tho&s;e regular &s;quares, or well-built &s;treets, in which the architect di&s;plays his genius. Its environs are full of hills of du&s;t, formed by the rubbi&s;h every day accumulating; whil&s;t the multitude of tombs, and the &s;tench of the common &s;ewers, are offen&s;ive to the &s;mell and &s;ight. Within the walls the &s;treets are winding and narrow; and, as they are not paved, the crowds of men, camels, a&s;&s;es and dogs, which pre&s;s again&s;t each other, rai&s;e a very di&s;agreeable du&s;t; individuals often water their doors, and to this du&s;t &s;ucceeds mud and pe&s;tiferous exhalations. Con|trary to the general cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t, the hou&s;es have two or three &s;tories; over which is a terrace of &s;tone, or tile. All the&s;e hou&s;es have the air of pri&s;ons; for they have no light from the &s;treet. The rooms within are ill contrived. Among the great, however, are to be found &s;ome orna|ments, as well as conveniences; their va&s;t halls, e&s;pe|cially, in which water &s;pouts up into marble ba&s;ons, are peculiarly well adapted to the climate. The paved floor, inlaid with marble and coloured earthen
<PB N="295" REF="304">
ware, is covered with mats and mattra&s;&s;es; and over all is &s;pread a rich carpet, on which every one fits cro&s;s-legged. Around the wall is a &s;ort of &s;opha, with cu&s;hions to &s;upport the back and elbows; and above, at the height of &s;even or eight feet, a range of &s;helves, decked out with China and Japane&s;e por|celain. The walls, naked in other re&s;pects, are che|quered with &s;entences extracted from the koran, and painted foliages and flowers, with which al&s;o the por|ticos of the beys are covered; the windows have nei|ther gla&s;s, nor moving &s;a&s;hes, but only an open lattice-work, which frequently co&s;ts more than our glazing. The light enters from the inner courts, from whence the &s;ycamores reflect a verdure, plea&s;ing to the eye. An opening to the North, or at the top of the ceiling, admits a fre&s;h breeze, while, by a whim&s;ical contra|diction, they wrap them&s;elves up in warm woollen cloths and furs. The rich pretend, by this means, to e&s;cape di&s;ea&s;es; but the common people, with their blue &s;hirts, and hard mats, are le&s;s liable to take cold, and enjoy better health.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ingularities which appear mo&s;t extra|ordinary to a &s;tranger at Cairo, may be mentioned the great number of ugly dogs, which roam about the &s;treets; and the kites, which &s;kim over the hou&s;es, with frequent and doleful cries. The mu&s;&s;ulmen kill neither of the&s;e, though they are equally held to be
<PB N="296" REF="305">
unclean; on the contrary, they often throw them the fragment of their tables; and devotees here, as in the other parts of the Turki&s;h dominions, endow chari|table foundations of bread and water for the dogs. The&s;e animals have be&s;ides, the re&s;ource of the com|mon &s;ewers; which, however, does not prevent them from &s;uffering by hunger and thir&s;t; but it is very a&s;|toni&s;hing, that the&s;e extremities never occa&s;ion mad|ne&s;s. <HI>Pro&s;per Alpinus</HI> has already made this re|mark, in his treati&s;e on the phy&s;ic of the Egyptians. Canine madne&s;s is equally unknown in Syria; the name of the malady, however, is to be found in the Arabic language, and is not borrowed from any fo|reign tongue.</P>
<P>Among other things worthy of notice in Grand Cairo, we mu&s;t not omit the ovens for hatching chickens. It &s;eems incredible, that they &s;hould be able to hatch chickens without the hen's &s;itting upon the eggs; and &s;till more improbable, that they &s;hould afterwards &s;ell the&s;e chichens by the bu&s;hel, and yet both of the&s;e are done. The eggs are laid in ovens, which they can heat to &s;uch a temperature, as to be like the natural heat of the hens; by this means, the chickens when hatched, are as &s;trong and well fledged, as tho&s;e produced in the common way, The&s;e ovens are built in a low place, and almo&s;t under ground. They are made of earth, in a circular form, and the
<PB N="297" REF="306">
earth is covered with flax and cow's hair, on which the eggs are laid. There are twelve of the&s;e ovens placed in two rows, one over the other, with a pa&s;&s;age be|tween. The eggs, to the number of eight or nine thou&s;and in each oven, are arranged in heaps in the lower &s;tory, and a fire of dried cow-dung kindled in the upper row, morning and evening, an hour each. This repeated for eight days, and the building being &s;ufficiently heated, the fire is put out, every aperture clo&s;ed, and a part of the eggs heaped below, are car|ried above. The &s;uperintendant occa&s;ionally exa|mines, if it be nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the heat. On the nineteenth day, the chickens begin to move in their &s;hells, nibble with their beaks on the twentieth, endeavouring to break their pri&s;on, and are u&s;ually completely hatched on the twenty-fir&s;t: then do the&s;e eggs, apparently lifele&s;s, begin to move, and roll about the floor, and thou&s;ands of little various co|loured chickens to run and hop round the apartment. This &s;ight is truly diverting. They are carried in panniers, and cried about the &s;treets on the morrow, each hou&s;e &s;tocking it&s;elf at a halfpenny a piece. Various authors have &s;aid, the&s;e fowls are not &s;o good as tho&s;e hatched by the hen, but they are mi&s;taken, &s;ays <HI>Savary;</HI> for a French cook, whom he &s;aw at Grand Cairo, bought them every year, and when well well fed, they became excellent poultry.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="307">There are only four months in the year proper for this operation, on account of the great heats; the&s;e are from December to April, and in that time it is computed, there are above three hundred thou&s;and chickens hatched in this manner. This commerce is carried on by the Copts; the great art &s;eems to be in giving the ovens a proper degree of heat, as too much, or too little, will de&s;troy the embryo.</P>
<P>Boulac, only half a league from Grand Cairo, and making part of its &s;uburbs, is the port where all the merchandize, from Damietta and Alexandria, is land|ed. This &s;uburb, &s;ituated on the Ea&s;tern bank of the Nile, is two miles long, but narrow. It contains &s;uperb public baths, and va&s;t okals. The&s;e are &s;quare buildings, including a large court with a portico, over which is a winding gallery: the ground-floor is di|vided into &s;pacious magazines, and the rooms above have neither furniture nor ornaments. Here &s;tran|gers live and depo&s;it their wares; and the&s;e okals, having only one gate, like that of a citadel, are &s;ecure in time of revolt, from all in&s;ult. The&s;e are the only inns in Egypt, and &s;trangers are obliged to find their own furniture and food; for, in this country, money cannot procure dinners ready dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In front of the hou&s;es at Boulac, are &s;een thou|&s;ands of ve&s;&s;els, of various forms and &s;izes, at anchor.
<PB N="299" REF="308">
Some large and &s;trong, carrying two ma&s;ts, are trad|ing barks; the&s;e u&s;ually have a large cabbin for pa&s;|&s;engers: others, light and without decks, are only to ferry people from one &s;ide of the river to the other. A third &s;ort, are plea&s;ure-boats, artfully carved and painted, containing charming cabins, carpeted over, and affording &s;helter from the &s;un's heat. Here, re|clined at ea&s;e, on cu&s;hions, the wealthy go to breathe that fre&s;h and cooling air, which is continually active upon the Nile; and here admire the variegated land|&s;capes which its ever-verdant banks pre&s;ent. When the wind is favourable, the &s;ail is hoi&s;ted, and the&s;e light boats &s;eem to fly over the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P>Half a league from Boulac, is the old ca&s;tle of Hellai. Here the beys, accompanied by their &s;tately train, go to receive the new pacha, and conduct him in pomp to the pri&s;on, from which they have ju&s;t ex|pelled his predece&s;&s;or. Round this ca&s;tle are &s;pacious enclo&s;ures, where the orange, citron, and pome|granate, planted without order, grow exceedingly high and tufted: their twining branches form charm|ing arbours, over which the &s;ycamore and palm extend their dark-green foliage, and among them rivulets meander, and the clu&s;tering ro&s;e and bazil bloom. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the delight of breathing the fre&s;h air, beneath the&s;e enchanting &s;hades; under a
<PB N="300" REF="309">
climate &s;o continually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the burning heat of the dog-days; this plea&s;ure only can be felt. The odour of the orange flower, and the aromatic emana|tions of bal&s;amic plants, gently renovate the &s;en&s;es, and infu&s;e the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations. It is dan|gerous for a European to frequent the&s;e groves, being peopled by concubines, whom the jealous Turks, if they &s;lip, never pardon. Abandoned to the de|lights of contemplation, and indulging tho&s;e delicious &s;en&s;ations the time and place in&s;pired, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> I once, incautiou&s;ly, proceeded towards the thicke&s;t part of one of them; when a terrifying voice &s;ud|denly exclaimed&mdash;Where are you going? Stand, or you are dead.&mdash;It was a &s;lave who guarded the en|trance of the grove, that no ra&s;h curio&s;ity might di&s;turb the females who repo&s;ed on the verdant banks. I in|&s;tantly turned about, happy in not having been known to be a European. I afterwards under&s;tood, the beys go there &s;ometimes with their harem, and that any over iniqui&s;itive &s;tranger, who &s;hould wander there at &s;uch a time, would ri&s;k the immediate lo&s;s of his head.</P>
<P>While de&s;cribing the environs of Grand Cairo, we ought not to forget the ancient Heliopolis, formerly famous for cultivating the higher branches of &s;cience, and for the grandeur of its building. <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us, it was built on a long &s;lip of earth, rai&s;ed by men, to
<PB N="301" REF="310">
&s;ecure it from inundation; and the place he de&s;cribes, is covered with ruins, two leagues North-ea&s;t of Cairo.</P>
<P>Heliopolis, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a temple of the &s;un; where, in a particular enclo&s;ure, the &s;acred ox was fed. This ox, was adored here by the name of <HI>Mnevis,</HI> as he was at Memphis, by that of <HI>Apis.</HI> The credulous people &s;uppo&s;ed it a god; the prie&s;ts, an animal, mo&s;t u&s;eful to agriculture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a country, where he a&s;&s;i&s;ts in tillage, and afterwards in watering the earth, during &s;ix months of the year. When the waters of the Nile are low, oxen are employed to turn machines, with chain-buckets, which rai&s;e the water into re&s;ervoirs, whence it is di&s;per&s;ed over the grounds; for which rea&s;on, this animal is pre&s;erved at its birth, and it is forbidden to kill a calf in Egypt.</P>
<P>The temple of the &s;un was not the only one at He|liopolis; there was another, built in the old Egyptian &s;tile, with &s;phynx avenues, and &s;tately obeli&s;ks before the principal entrance. Nothing could have a finer effect, than the colo&s;&s;al figures of marble, and high pil|lars of a &s;ingle &s;tone, which were in front of the ve&s;|tibule of Egyptian temples. The&s;e temples were ruins, in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> Two, of the four obeli&s;ks, which <HI>Sochis</HI> had erected in that city, were carried to Rome; a third was de&s;troyed by the Arabs;
<PB N="302" REF="311">
and the fourth remains on its pede&s;tal. It is a &s;ingle &s;tone, brought from the Thebais, perfectly poli&s;hed, &s;ixty-eight feet high above the ba&s;e, and about &s;ix feet and a half &s;quare. The obeli&s;k is in good pre|&s;ervation. This, and one &s;phynx of yellowi&s;h mar|ble, thrown in the du&s;t, are the only remains of He|liopolis.</P>
<P>There was formerly a college of prie&s;ts here, where, for more than a thou&s;and years, they had made a&s;tro|nomical ob&s;ervations; and, by their labours, calcu|lated the &s;olar year of 365 days, and &s;ome minutes; which alone, will prove the extent of their know|ledge in this &s;cience. It was many years afterwards, before the people of Europe could exactly determine the &s;olar year; and <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar,</HI> wi&s;hing to reform the Roman kalendar, was obliged to employ an a&s;tro|nomer of Alexandria.</P>
<P>At Heliopolis, <HI>Herodotus</HI> was chiefly in&s;tructed in the &s;ciences, and Egyptian my&s;teries; which were tho&s;e profound branches of knowledge, they thought proper to conceal from the people, under the veil of religion; and, by writing them in hieroglyphics. En|lightened by what he learnt from them, this father of hi&s;tory, was crowned at the Olympic games; and the nine books he compo&s;ed, deemed worthy of the nine mu&s;es, who&s;e names they bore. And yet, how
<PB N="303" REF="312">
many people, remarks <HI>Savary,</HI> who have not read him at all, or not enough, have dared to critici&s;e, or call him fabulous. For my own part, &s;ays the above wri|ter, &s;u&s;pending his judgment on the remainder of his hi&s;tory, I can only e&s;timate the worth of what he &s;ays concerning Egypt; and, with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction I can truly &s;ay, I have found the manners and cu&s;|toms of this country, &s;uch as he de&s;cribes them; ex|cept with &s;ome &s;light modifications, as a change of go|vernment and religion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have intro|duced. As to the monuments he has de&s;cribed, what remains, proves he has not exaggerated, and demon|&s;trates the po&s;&s;ibility of what is no more. Ju&s;tice de|mands this homage, in favour of an hi&s;torian, who, like <HI>Homer,</HI> was the painter of nations.</P>
<P>Heliopolis has not only the glory of having in|&s;tructed <HI>Herodotus,</HI> but al&s;o of having taught philo|&s;ophy to <HI>Plato;</HI> who, from the &s;ublimity of his doc|trine, has obtained the epithet of Divine. In this city, <HI>Eudoxus</HI> remained thirteen years, and became one of the mo&s;t famous a&s;tronomers of his time. What now remains of all her monuments, and of all her &s;ciences? A barbarous Per&s;ian has overthrown her temples; a fanatic Arab burnt her books; and one &s;olitary obe|li&s;k, overlooking her ruins, &s;ays to pa&s;&s;engers, THIS ONCE WAS HELIOPOLIS.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313"><HI>Herodotus,</HI> and &s;ome other writers after him, relate &s;ome particulars concerning the Phoenix, and the tem|ple of the &s;un; which, if true, would be very won|derful. Of this kind of birds, according to the opi|nions of the ancients, there is never but one at a time in the world. He is brought forth in Arabia, is about the &s;ize of an eagle, and lives between five and &s;ix hundred years. His head is adorned with a &s;hining and mo&s;t beautiful cre&s;t; the feathers of his neck are of a gold colour, and the re&s;t are purple; his tail is white, intermixed with red, and his eyes &s;parkling like &s;tars. When he finds his end approaching, he builds a ne&s;t with wood, and aromatic &s;pices, and then dies. From his bones and marrow a worm is produced, out of which another phoenix is formed. His fir&s;t care, is to &s;olemnize his parent's ob&s;equies; for this pur|po&s;e, he makes up a ball in the &s;hape of an egg, with abundance of perfumes, as large as he can carry; a hole is then made in it, into which he puts his parent's body, and clo&s;es it up carefully with myrrh, and other perfumes. After this, he takes up the precious load, and flying to the altar of the &s;un, in the city of Helio|polis, he there burns it.</P>
<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> di&s;pute the truth of the cir|cum&s;tances, as here related; but &s;uppo&s;e it to be true in general. <HI>Pliny,</HI> on the contrary, looks upon the whole to be fabulous; and this is the opinion of mo&s;t
<PB N="305" REF="314">
modern authors&punc; This ancient tradition, hath intro|duced into mo&s;t languages, the cu&s;tom of giving the appellation of phoenix, to whatever is &s;ingular and uncommon. <HI>Rara avis in terris,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Juvenal,</HI> a rare bird, when &s;peaking of the difficulty to find an ac|compli&s;hed woman in the world. <HI>Seneca</HI> makes the &s;ame remark, re&s;pecting a good man.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from Heliopolis, is the &s;mall village of Mataree, &s;o called, becau&s;e it has a fre&s;h water &s;pring; and what is remarkable, the only one in Egypt. Tradition has rendered it famous, as being the place to which the holy family came, when they fled from <HI>Herod:</HI> and that the ble&s;&s;ed virgin bathed the child <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in this fountain. In this village was an enclo&s;ure, where &s;lips of the bal&s;am &s;hrub brought from Mecca, was cultivated; and which the Ea&s;tern women made u&s;e of, to give a fre&s;hne&s;s to the com|plexion, and to fortify the &s;tomach. This precious plant is lo&s;t to Egypt; where the pachas, for it was a pacha who brought it from Mecca, do not &s;tay long enough to think of any thing, but the intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>Giza, &s;uppo&s;ed by many writers, to be the ancient &s;cite of the Memphis, is &s;ituated oppo&s;ite to Grand Cairo, on the other &s;ide of the Nile, and is the village where the French merchants have their country

hou&s;es. The beautiful i&s;land of Raouda, and its odo|riferous bowers, the Mekias, again&s;t which the waves beat with violence, old Cairo, and its &s;urrounding gardens, with a multitude of boats, which are con|tinually cro&s;&s;ing the river, are &s;een from the principal hou&s;es: exten&s;ive and verdant pro&s;pects, variegated with hou&s;es, mo&s;ques, or more di&s;tant minarets, charm the eye, inducing the &s;pectators to &s;it hours contemplating the&s;e &s;miling objects; while the fre&s;h air, which follows the cour&s;e of the Nile in currents, comes, re-animates the &s;en&s;es, and gives the &s;oul that energy, which is nece&s;&s;ary to ta&s;te the beautiful and the &s;ublime. To Giza, therefore, fatigued by bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or &s;uffocated by the heats of Grand Cairo, the French come to repo&s;e; at Giza they recover their health, and in pure and cooling air, breathe life in the aromatic exhalations of plants and flowers.</P>
<P>At &s;ome farther di&s;tance from Grand Cairo, on a canal running into the lake Bourlos, is the village of Tanta, where there is a con&s;iderable annual fair, to which the inhabitants of upper and lower Egypt come in crouds, to exchange their native produces for India &s;tuffs, Moka coffee, and French cloths. It con|tinues a week; and de&s;ire of gain brings &s;ome of the Egyptians, while love of plea&s;ure cau&s;es many more to come to it. Ten thou&s;and boats are upon the canal at this &s;ea&s;on, all carrying abundance of pro|vi&s;ions;
<PB N="307" REF="316">
where are good cheer, mu&s;ic, and rejoicing. There are nearly as many tents pitched on &s;hore, to which the mo&s;t famous courtezans of Egypt fail not to come. They likewi&s;e go on board the boats, where they di&s;play their talents for dancing, &s;inging, and gallantry. Many gla&s;s lamps are nightly lighted; the repetition of which, reflects innumerable &s;tars in the waters. The tents have the &s;ame, and this wonderful illumination, for the extent of a league, produces on the gra&s;s, and the chry&s;tal &s;treams, charming effects. The&s;e fairs, much frequented, are not uncommon. They are the remains of the ancient pilgrimages of the Egyptians, to Canopus, Sais, and Bubu&s;tus.</P>
<P>The three other cities we propo&s;e to notice, are Alexandria, Ro&s;etta, and Damietta.</P>
<P>The city of Alexandria, founded by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and afterwards &s;o much admired and adorned by the Romans, the re&s;idence of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and re|fuge of <HI>Anthony,</HI> once famous for its magnificence, luxury, and learning, is now become an undi&s;tingui&s;h|able heap of ruins; baths, palaces, porticos, and am|phitheatres, lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly jumbled together. The &s;avage race of the Saracens, when they took it, has re|duced it to this mi&s;erable &s;tate; but a circum&s;tance more to be lamented than any other, was the de&s;truc|tion of the famous Ptolemean library, containing one
<PB N="308" REF="317">
hundred thou&s;and volumes. On taking the city, the general &s;ent to the caliph, to know his orders re&s;pect|ing the&s;e books; who returned for an&s;wer, by all means to burn them; for if they were agreeable to the Al|coran, they were &s;uperfluous, and if contrary to it, impious; accordingly, the Mu&s;&s;ulmen applied them to the purpo&s;e of heating their baths, and it was &s;ix months before they were con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The name of this city, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> &s;peaking of Alex|andria, which recalls to memory the genius of one of the mo&s;t wonderful of men; the name of the country which reminds us of &s;o many great events; the pic|ture&s;que appearance of the place it&s;elf; the &s;preading palm-trees; the terraced hou&s;es, which &s;eem to have no roof; the lofty &s;lender minarets; every thing an|nounces to the traveller who has ju&s;t entered Egypt, that he is in another world; a variety of novel ob|jects pre&s;ent them&s;elves to every &s;en&s;e; he hears a language, who&s;e barbarous &s;ounds, and &s;harp and guttural accents, offend his ear; he &s;ees dre&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t unu&s;ual and whim&s;ical kind, and figures of the &s;trange&s;t appearance. In&s;tead of our naked faces, our heads &s;welled out with hair, our triangular head-dre&s;&s;es, and our &s;hort and clo&s;e habits, he views with a&s;toni&s;hment, tanned vi&s;ages, with beards and mu&s;ta|chios, bundles of &s;tuff, rolled up in folds, on their bald heads; long garments, which, reaching from the
<PB N="309" REF="318">
neck to the heels, &s;erve rather to veil, than clothe the body; pipes of &s;ix feet long, with which every one is provided; hideous camels, which carry water in leathern pouches; and &s;addled and bridled a&s;&s;es, which lightly trip along with their riders in flippers: he ob&s;erves their markets ill &s;upplied with dates, and round flat little loaves; a filthy drove of half-&s;tarved dogs roaming through the &s;treets, and a kind of wan|dering phantoms; which, under a &s;ingle piece of dra|pery, di&s;cover nothing human, but two eyes, which &s;hew they are women.</P>
<P>Amid this croud of unu&s;ual objects, his mind is incapable of reflection; nor is it until he has reached his place of re&s;idence, &s;o de&s;irable after a long voyage, that, after becoming more calm, he reflects on the narrow, ill-paved &s;treets, the low hou&s;es, which, though not calculated to admit much light, are &s;till more ob|&s;cured by lattice-work, the meagre and &s;warthy in|habitants, who walk bare-footed, without other cloath|ing than a blue &s;hirt, fa&s;tened with a leathern girdle, or a red handkerchief; while the univer&s;al air of mi|&s;ery, &s;o manife&s;t in all he meets, and the my&s;tery which reigns around their hou&s;es, point out to him the rapacity of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the di&s;tru&s;t attendant upon &s;lavery.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="319">But his whole attention is &s;oon attracted by tho&s;e va&s;t ruins, which appear on the land &s;ide of the city. In our countries ruins are an object of curio&s;ity. Scarcely can we di&s;cover, in unfrequented places, &s;ome ancient ca&s;tle, who&s;e decay announces rather the de&s;ertion of its ma&s;ter, than the wretchedne&s;s of the neighbourhood. In Alexandria, on the contrary, we no &s;ooner leave the New Town, than we are a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the &s;ight of an immen&s;e extent of ground, over&s;pread with ruins. In a walk of two hours we follow a double line of walls and turrets, which form the circumference of ancient Alexandria. The earth is covered with the remains of lofty buildings de&s;|troyed; whole fronts crumbled down, roofs fallen in, battlements decayed, and the &s;tones corroded, and disfigured by &s;alt-petre. The traveller pa&s;&s;es over a va&s;t plain, furrowed with trenches, pierced with wells, divided by walls in ruins, covered over with ancient columns and modern tombs, amid palm-trees and no|pals, (the cochineal); and where no living creature is to be met with, but owls, bats, and jackalls.</P>
<P>Modern Alexandria is a place of &s;mall extent, &s;carcely containing &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants, but ex|ceedingly commercial; which advantage it owes to its &s;ituation. Ancient Alexandria contained three hundred thou&s;and free inhabitants in the time of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus;</HI> a double number of &s;laves may, at lea&s;t, be
<PB N="311" REF="320">
added; and the amount will be nine hundred thou|&s;and. How prodigious the difference!</P>
<P>The canal of Faoua, the only one which &s;till runs to Alexandria, and without which it could no longer be a town, &s;ince it has not a drop of &s;oft water, is half filled up with mud and &s;and. Under the govern|ment of the Romans, and even of the Arabs, it was navigable all the year; and its banks were &s;haded by date-trees, covered by vines, and ornamented with plea&s;ure-hou&s;es. The &s;tream only flows now about the end of Augu&s;t, leaving &s;carce time to fill the re|&s;ervoirs; the lands are become de&s;arts, and the groves and gardens have di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Yet are not all the tokens of ancient magnificence effaced: the ci&s;terns, built under all parts of the city, are almo&s;t entire. Toward the ea&s;tern part of the palace are two marble obeli&s;ks, vulgarly called <HI>Cleo|patra</HI>'s needles, containing numerous hieroglyphics: one is thrown down, broken, and covered with &s;and; the other &s;till re&s;ts on its pede&s;tal; each, cut from one &s;ingle &s;tone, is about &s;ixty feet high, and &s;even feet &s;quare, at the ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the maje&s;ty of a column of red granite, &s;tanding near the &s;outhern gate of this city, commonly known by the name of <HI>Pompey</HI>'s pillar, and
<PB N="312" REF="321">
which is the mo&s;t &s;triking object now extant. The whole column is a hundred and fourteen feet high, and &s;till pre&s;erves a perfect poli&s;h. The circum|ference of the ba&s;e is about &s;ixty feet. The &s;haft and the upper &s;tories of the ba&s;e are one &s;ingle block of ninety feet long, and nine in diameter.</P>
<P>At a di&s;tance this column is &s;een predominant over the city, and at &s;ea &s;erves as a &s;ignal for mariners. When near, it excites a&s;toni&s;hment, mingled with awe; the &s;pectator is never weary of admiring the beauty of the capital, the length of the &s;haft, or the grand &s;implicity of the pede&s;tal.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit mentioning the manner by which &s;ome Engli&s;h ma&s;ters of &s;hips contrived to get to the top of it; they flew a kite over the pillar, in &s;uch a direction, that when the &s;tring was loo&s;ed, to let it fall, and the kite came to the ground, the &s;tring lay acro&s;s the top of the pillar, by means of which they pa&s;&s;ed ropes over; and, making &s;hrouds, the &s;ame as to the ma&s;t of a &s;hip, they went up triumphantly, drinking a bowl of punch on the &s;ummit, and di&s;co|vering that there had formerly been a pede&s;trian &s;ta|tue on it, a piece of the foot remaining.</P>
<P>Travellers, and men of literature, have made many fruitle&s;s attempts, to di&s;cover to what prince it was
<PB N="313" REF="322">
dedicated. The mo&s;t intelligent have thought it could not be in honour of <HI>Pompey;</HI> &s;ince <HI>Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> have not mentioned it; they there|fore remained in doubt from which, &s;ays <HI>Savary, Abul|&s;eda</HI> might have relieved them. He calls it the co|lumn of <HI>Severus,</HI> and hi&s;tory informs us, this Emperor vi&s;ited, and de&s;erved well of its inhabitants. This column was a mark of their gratitude; the Greek in|&s;cription, half effaced, but vi&s;ible on the we&s;tern &s;ide, when the &s;un &s;hines on it, was no doubt legible in the time of <HI>Abulfeda,</HI> and contained the name of <HI>Severus.</HI> Neither is this the &s;ole monument erected to him, by the gratitude of the people of Alexandria. In the mid&s;t of the ruins of Antinoe, built by <HI>Adrian,</HI> is a magni|ficent column, the in&s;cription on which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, dedicated to <HI>Alexander Severus.</HI></P>
<P>In its modern &s;tate, Alexandria is the emporium of a con&s;iderable commerce. It is the harbour for all commodities, exported from Egypt to the Mediter|ranean, except the rice of Damietta. The Europe|ans have e&s;tabli&s;hments here, where factors di&s;po&s;e of our merchandize. Ve&s;&s;els are con&s;tantly to be met with from Mar&s;eilles, Leghorn, Venice, Ragu&s;a, and the dominions of the Grand Signior; but it is dangerous to winter here. The new port, the only harbour for Europeans, is clogged up with &s;and; &s;o that in &s;tormy weather &s;hips are liable to bulge: and the
<PB N="314" REF="323">
bottom being al&s;o rocky, the cables &s;oon cha&s;e and part, one ve&s;&s;el then driving again&s;t a &s;econd, and that again&s;t a third, they are perhaps all lo&s;t. Of this there was a fatal in&s;tance, &s;ixteen or eighteen years ago, when &s;ixty-two ve&s;&s;els were da&s;hed to pieces on the mole, in a gale of wind from the North-we&s;t.</P>
<P>The old port is not &s;ubject to this inconvenience; but the Turks admit no &s;hips into it, except tho&s;e of Mu&s;&s;ulmen. It will perhaps be a&s;ked why they do not repair the new port? The an&s;wer is, in Turkey they de&s;troy every thing, and repair nothing. The old harbour will be de&s;troyed likewi&s;e, as the balla&s;t of ve&s;&s;els has been continually thrown into it, for the&s;e la&s;t two hundred years.</P>
<P>At the extremity of one of the arms of the new port &s;tood the famous Pharos, reckoned one of the wonders of the world; and which has nothing now to repre&s;ent it, but a Turki&s;h fort, built on the &s;ame &s;pot, and probably out of its ruins.</P>
<P>In time of war Alexandria is of no importance; no fortification is to be &s;een; even the Pharos, with its lofty turrets, cannot be defended. A &s;ingle Ru&s;|&s;ian or Malte&s;e frigate, would &s;uffice to lay it in a&s;hes; but the conque&s;t would be of no value. A foreign power could not maintain it&s;elf there, as the country
<PB N="315" REF="324">
is without water. This mu&s;t be brought from the Nile by the kalidj, or canal of twelve leagues; which &s;upply of water would undoubtedly be cut off, were a foreign power to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Alexandria.</P>
<P>It is the canal alone that connects Alexandria with Egypt; for, from its &s;ituation without the Delta, and the nature of the &s;oil, it really belongs to the de&s;arts of Africa, and we do not enter Egypt until we arrive at Ro&s;etta; there the &s;ands, peculiar to Africa, end: and a black, fat, and loamy &s;oil, the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tic of Egypt, begins. There al&s;o, for the fir&s;t, we behold the waters of the celebrated Nile, which, rolling between two &s;teep banks, con&s;iderably re&s;emble the Seine, between Auteuil and Pa&s;&s;y. The woods of palm-trees on each &s;ide, the orchards, watered by its &s;treams, the lemon, the orange, the banana, the peach, and other trees, by their perpetual verdure, render Ro&s;etta a&s;toni&s;hingly delightful.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians tell us, that <HI>Alexander</HI>'s body was em|balmed in this city, in a coffin of gold, which, as may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, was taken away, and it was put into one of gla&s;s; being pre&s;erved therein &s;o late as to the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who took a view of it in that &s;tate, adorned it with a gold crown, and wept over it.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325">Ro&s;etta, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t towns in Egypt. It &s;preads along the we&s;tern bank of the Nile; and is nearly a league in length, and one-fourth in width. No remarkable &s;quare is &s;een here; no &s;treet perfectly &s;trait; but the hou&s;es, built with ter|races, &s;tanding a&s;under, and kept in good repair, have a plea&s;ing air of neatne&s;s and elegance. The only remarkable public edifices are the mo&s;ques; the lofty minarets of which are built in a light, bold &s;tile; and produce a picture&s;que effect, in a town where all the roofs are flat, by throwing variety into the picture. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es have a pro&s;pect of the Nile and the Delta; a truly magnificent one! Ve&s;&s;els and boats, &s;ome rowing, &s;ome under &s;ail, continually cover the river; while the tumult of the port, the mirth of the mariners, and their noi&s;y mu&s;ic, pre&s;ent a &s;cene ever moving, ever alive. The Delta, that immen&s;e gar|den, where the exhau&s;tle&s;s earth is never weary of pro|ducing, affords an eternal view of harve&s;ts, vegetables, flowers, and fruits, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the abundant vari|ety of which, at once, gladdens the eye and the heart. Various &s;pecies of cucumbers, delicious melons, the fig, the orange, the banana, the pomegranate, all grow here, all have an exqui&s;ite flavour.</P>
<P>North of the city are gardens, where citron, orange, date, and &s;ycamore trees, are promi&s;cuou&s;ly planted; and the arbours they form, impenetrable to
<PB N="317" REF="326">
the &s;un's rays, by the mingling of the trees, together with the flowers &s;cattered among them, render the&s;e groves mo&s;t enchanting.</P>
<P>When the atmo&s;phere is all on fire, when the big moi&s;ture cour&s;es down every member, when ga&s;ping man pants after cool air, with what ec&s;tacy does he go and re&s;pire under the&s;e bowers, and be&s;ide the rivu|let, by which they are watered! There the Turk, with his long ja&s;&s;mine pipe, wrought with amber, imagines him&s;elf tran&s;ported into the garden of delight, which <HI>Mahomet</HI> promi&s;ed: thoughtle&s;s in tranquil apathy, he &s;mokes the &s;un down, void of de&s;ire, void of am|bition. His calm pa&s;&s;ions never ca&s;t one curious look towards futurity; content with what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he neither invents, nor brings the inventions of others to perfection; his life to us &s;eems a &s;lumber, ours to him one continued &s;tate of intoxication. While we are ever pur&s;uing happine&s;s, which continually eludes our gra&s;ps, he peaceably enjoys the good which na|ture gives, without troubling him&s;elf concerning the morrow.</P>
<P>Here, in the&s;e gardens, the young Georgians, &s;old into &s;lavery by barbarous parents, quit, with the veil which covers them, that decency they ob&s;erve in public. Freed here from all con&s;traint, they cau&s;e la&s;civious dances to be performed in their pre&s;ence; &s;ing tender
<PB N="318" REF="327">
&s;ongs, and relate tales and romances, which pre&s;ent an undi&s;gui&s;ed picture of their manners, and plea&s;ures. Born in a temperate clime, they receive from nature a &s;oul of energy, and tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions; brought afterwards into Egypt, the fire of the atmo&s;phere, the perfume of the orange-flower, and the emanations of aromatic plants, voluptuou&s;ly invade every &s;en&s;e; then does one &s;ole care employ, one &s;ole de&s;ire tor|ment them; one only predominant want is felt; the violence of which is increa&s;ed by the re&s;traint under which they are kept.</P>
<P>Ro&s;etta, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> may well excite the curio&s;ity of a European, who &s;ees &s;o many new objects, that he imagines him&s;elf tran&s;ported into another world; men and nature, all he beholds is changed. A dead &s;i|lence reigns throughout the city, uninterrupted by the noi&s;e of carriages; camels are the carriers here; nothing alters or di&s;turbs the grave walk of the inha|bitants; their long garments float down to their heels; the head is loaded with a heavy turban, or encircled with a &s;hawl; they cut their hair off, and let their beards grow. Sa&s;hes are common to both &s;exes; the citizen is armed with a knife, the &s;oldier with a &s;abre, and two pi&s;tols. The women of low rank, who&s;e clothing con&s;i&s;ts of an ample blue &s;hift, and long drawers, cover their faces with a bit of cloth, having holes oppo&s;ite the eyes; the rich wear a large white
<PB N="319" REF="328">
veil, with a black &s;ilk mantle, enveloping the body, like a domino. A &s;tranger &s;carcely dares look at them; to &s;peak would be a crime; but the&s;e ma&s;ks are liberal of their &s;igns and oglings; and, as this is the only language they are permitted to u&s;e in public, it is more expre&s;&s;ive, more copious, and in much higher perfection than in Europe; every thing is &s;aid, and wonderfully well under&s;tood, without opening the lips.</P>
<P>The country is as different from the neighbour|hood of Paris, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> and we may add of Lon|don, as is Ro&s;etta from a town in France, or in Eng|land. An immen&s;e flat, without hill or mountain, inter&s;ected by innumerable canals; corn-fields, branch|ing &s;ycamores, who&s;e unperi&s;hable wood pre&s;erves the mud-wall hut, into which the hu&s;bandman retires du|ding winter, for he &s;leeps under the &s;hade in &s;ummer; date-trees in clu&s;ters, or &s;cattered over the plain, the profu&s;e fruit of which is nutritive, &s;weet and &s;alutary; the ca&s;&s;ia with fertile branches, decked in yellow flowers, and bearing a pod well known in pharmacy; orange and citron trees, unmutilated by the pruning knife, who&s;e projecting odoriferous boughs form ar|bours impenetrable by the &s;un's rays; &s;uch are the objects of the Delta, and &s;uch its principal trees and &s;hrubs. Winter does not rob them of their foliage; they are apparelled all the year, as if every month was May.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="329">The rice-ground round Ro&s;etta is known by the name <HI>Sultani,</HI> and is appropriated to the u&s;e and con&s;umption of Con&s;tantinople. As &s;oon as the rice is down, the &s;tubble is torn up, the land &s;lightly dre&s;&s;ed, and barley is &s;own, which pre&s;ently ripens. Tho&s;e who prefer a crop of hay inundate the field, and &s;ow it with lucern, which grows &s;o fa&s;t, that in twenty days it is a foot and a half high, and &s;o thick that its &s;ur|face appears one &s;olid verdure. It is three times cut before the &s;ea&s;on of tran&s;planting the rice; thus the &s;ame field will either yield two crops of grain; one of rice and the other of barley; or four crops, one of rice and three of hay. This fecundity is, however, peculiar to the Delta; when the land lying lower than in the Thebais may be watered, all the year, by means of the canals and machines.</P>
<P>The principal wealth of this city flows from com|merce. The tran&s;portation of foreign merchandize to Cairo, and of the productions of Egypt to the port of Alexandria, gives employment to a great number of mariners; their ve&s;&s;els are called <HI>&s;cherms,</HI> a light kind of boats with lateen &s;ails, and which having no decks are very hazardous; a gu&s;t of wind coming un|expectedly, turns them on their &s;ide, and they founder. The word &s;cherm, in Arabic, expre&s;&s;es the &s;wiftne&s;s with which the&s;e &s;mall ve&s;&s;els &s;kim the waves. The <HI>Bogaz,</HI> for &s;o they call the bar at the mouth of the
<PB N="321" REF="330">
Nile, and which is another Arabic word, de&s;criptive of the agitation of the waves, is a dangerous &s;hoal for the&s;e light boats. The waters here drive and &s;truggle to find a pa&s;&s;age into the &s;ea; and, when the wind fre&s;hens, the waves running mountains high, form whirlpools, which engulph ve&s;&s;els. The Bogaz is &s;hallow; and, in the extent of a league, there is &s;el|dom more than a pa&s;&s;age of &s;ome few fathoms for the ve&s;&s;els, which is continually changing.</P>
<P>The bar of the Nile is totally clo&s;ed, two months in the year, and the commerce of Alexandria inter|rupted; but were it to become totally impa&s;&s;able, and were all the &s;hipping of Egypt to be &s;wallowed up, the Ottoman government would not remove one foot of earth, from the canal of Faoua, to render it navi|gable. Committed to their care every thing pe|ri&s;hes, nothing is repaired.</P>
<P>Damietta, larger and not le&s;s agreeable than Ro|&s;etta, forms a &s;emi-circle on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Nile, two leagues and a half from its mouth. Stand|ing at one end of this cre&s;cent, the eye &s;urveys its whole extent. It contains about eighty thou&s;and in|habitants, has &s;everal &s;quares, one of which is called Men&s;hia. Bazars, filled with merchandize, okals or khans, as &s;pacious as tho&s;e of Cairo, under the por|ticos of which are Indian &s;tuffs, &s;ilks from Mount Le|banon,
<PB N="322" REF="331">
&s;al ammoniac, and quantities of rice be&s;peak it a commercial place. The hou&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e near the river, are very high; mo&s;t of them have plea&s;ant &s;aloons, built on the terraces; in which charming places, open to every wind, the Turk, indo|lently &s;eated on his &s;opha, pa&s;&s;es his life in &s;moaking, viewing the &s;ea, bounded by the horizon, the grand lake lying on the other &s;ide, and the Nile running between the two, which traver&s;es a rich country. Va|rious grand mo&s;ques, with high minarets, ornament the city. The public baths, faced with marble, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Grand Cairo; the linen is clean, and the water very pure.</P>
<P>Multitudes of boats, and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, ince&s;&s;antly fill the port of Damietta. The &s;cherms &s;erve to load and unload the &s;hips that anchor in the road; others are coa&s;ting pilot-boats. The fine&s;t rice of Egypt is cultivated in the neighbouring plains; and its annual exportation amounts to between two and three hun|dred thou&s;and pounds. There are likewi&s;e cloths, &s;al ammoniac, wheat, &amp;c. Laws, ruinous to the country, prohibit the exportation of the latter; but they are evaded, and it is pa&s;&s;ed as rice. The Chri&s;|tians of Aleppo and Dama&s;cus, for many ages e&s;ta|bli&s;hed here, carry on the principal trade: they are &s;uffered to grow rich by Turki&s;h indolence, which contents it&s;elf with occa&s;ional extortions. Exporta|tion
<PB N="323" REF="332">
of rice is forbidden; but by arrangements advan|tageous to the receiver of the cu&s;toms, the people of Provence annually load &s;everal &s;hips. The Bogaz prevents them from entering the Nile, and their car|goes are brought by boats, which practice is produc|tive of innumerable vexations and abu&s;es. The rice of the be&s;t quality, which departs in the evening for the &s;hip, &s;eldom arrives there, but an inferior &s;ort is &s;ub&s;tituted, during the night. The captains of Mar|&s;eilles, aware of the&s;e tricks, but unable to prevent them, endeavour to repel fraud by fraud, and traffic becomes a kind of mutual robbery. The thing mo&s;t di&s;advantageous to the commerce of Damietta is, its defective harbours; the road, where ve&s;&s;els lie, being expo&s;ed, every gale that ri&s;es the captains are obliged to &s;lip their cables, and take refuge at Cyprus, or keep the open &s;ea. By cutting a canal of half a league only, it would be ea&s;y to give &s;hips free en|trance into the Nile, which is deep; and this &s;mall expence would render Damietta a fine harbour.</P>
<P>The flip of land where this city is built, is only from two to &s;ix miles wide. Rivulets inter&s;ect it in every direction, and render it the mo&s;t fruitful part of Egypt. The rice, in common years, yields eighty bu&s;hels for one; and other products are in the &s;ame proportion. Here nature, eminently and profu&s;ely di&s;playing her riches and pomp, pre&s;ents, the year
<PB N="324" REF="333">
round, flowers, fruits and harve&s;ts. She withers not in winter, and fades not in &s;ummer. She is nei|ther &s;corched nor frozen. The thermometer only varies from the 29th above freezing, to the 24th. This happy temperature Damietta owes to the va&s;t quantities of water by which it is &s;urrounded. The thermometer ri&s;es twelve degrees higher at Grand Cairo. Verdure is no where &s;o fre&s;h. Trees no where &s;o loaded with fruit. The banks, among the rice-fields, bear &s;everal &s;pecies of reeds, &s;ome of which grow very high; among them is the calamus in abundance, with which the Orientals write. Its &s;mall &s;talk bears long narrow leaves, gracefully pen|dent and pliant branches, bedecked with white flow|ers. Here may be &s;een the papyrus, in quantities, the paper of the ancient Egyptians. The pre&s;ent &s;carcity of the papyrus, in Egypt, is owing to the avi|dity of the publicans, who will only &s;uffer it to grow in a few places, that they may rai&s;e the price. Of this <HI>Strabo</HI> complains; and the evil, it &s;eems, &s;till con|tinues. <HI>Savary</HI> ob&s;erves it is only to be &s;een round Damietta, and the lake Menzala; and that mo&s;t tra|vellers, who have been there, have not mentioned it; &s;ome, le&s;s circum&s;pect, have denied its exi&s;tence, and propagated &s;ables on the &s;ubject. This triangular ru&s;h, eight or nine feet high, and an inch thick, bears a lanigerous tuft. The lotus al&s;o here rai&s;es its proud &s;talk above the water, and appears the king of aquatic
<PB N="325" REF="334">
plants. The inland ponds and canals abound with this &s;tately flower, which yields a mo&s;t agreeable odour.</P>
<P>Damietta has many villages in its environs; mo&s;t of them have manufactories, where the fine&s;t Egyp|tian cloth is made, particularly napkins; much in re|que&s;t: at the ends of which is &s;ilk fringe. They are brought to table, e&s;pecially, on vi&s;its of ceremony; the &s;lave pre&s;ents one to wipe the mouth after drink|ing &s;herbet, or eating confectionary, &s;erved on a &s;il|ver plate. Round the&s;e villages u&s;ually are &s;mall woods, where the trees, planted promi&s;cuou&s;ly, have an uncommon, and picture&s;que effect.</P>
<P>A mile South-we&s;t of the town is an orange-grove, to which the inhabitants re&s;ort, where the walks are made &s;traight; and this is the only place where art has any way aided nature; no where el&s;e are the trees planted in rows. No words can expre&s;s the plea&s;ure of breathing the cool, and perfumed air of the&s;e de|lightful &s;hades. The unmutilated trees are above thirty feet high, and their intermingled branches, and thick foliage, all in bloom, from top to bottom, wholly exclude the &s;un's rays. Each orange-tree is a va&s;t no&s;egay, the flowers of which almo&s;t conceal the leaves, forming together the mo&s;t beautiful canopy, ever beheld. There is a &s;mall rivulet be&s;ide each row,
<PB N="326" REF="335">
and twice a day a re&s;ervoir is opened, by which the trees are watered. It is intoxication of plea&s;ure to walk here at noon; and never, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> did I &s;o foricbly feel all the delicious enjoyments, that odours and aromatics can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>At one end of this walk is a canal full of the papy|rus. Entering, on the left, &s;tands the gardener's hut, and a grove of citron and palm trees, planted &s;o near each other as &s;carce to grant admi&s;&s;ion. This place, enclo&s;ed by ditches and palli&s;adoes, is the a&s;ylum of my&s;tery, where the hand&s;ome&s;t of the Turki&s;h wo|men occa&s;ionally come to breathe, &s;ay they, bal&s;amic &s;weetne&s;s beneath the&s;e &s;hades.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this account of Damietta with a tale related by <HI>Savary,</HI> to prove that incidents, &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e of the times of <HI>Jacob,</HI> are &s;till renewed in Egypt. A farmer, near Dama&s;cus, reduced to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s as to be obliged to part with his implements of hu&s;bandry, led by the invi&s;ible hand of Provi|dence, as formerly <HI>Tobias</HI> was by the angel, while he bargained for corn, lately arrived from Damietta. He heard &s;peak of the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Mourad</HI> Bey, who had entered Grand Cairo victorious, and in triumph. The &s;hape, character and origin of the warrior were de&s;cribed, and how he had ri&s;en from &s;lavery to &s;u|preme power. The a&s;toni&s;hed farmer found the de|&s;cription
<PB N="327" REF="336">
accorded with a &s;on, who had been &s;tolen from him at twelve years old; hope palpitated in his heart; he ha&s;tened home with his provi&s;ions, told his family what he had heard, and determined immedi|ately to depart for Egypt. His weeping wife and &s;ons offered up prayers for his &s;afe return. Going to the port of Alexandretta, he embarked there, and came to Damietta. One continued fear tormented him; his &s;on, for&s;aking the religion of his ance&s;tors, had embraced Mahometani&s;m; and now, &s;urrounded as he was with &s;plendor, would he acknowledge his parents? The thought lay heavy on his heart; yet the wi&s;h to &s;natch his family from all the horrors of famine, the hope of finding a long lamented &s;on, gave him fortitude. He continued his journey, came to the capital, repaired to the palace of <HI>Mourad,</HI> applied to the officers of the prince, and mo&s;t ardently &s;oli|cited admi&s;&s;ion. His dre&s;s and appearance be&s;poke poverty and misfortunes, and were poor recommenda|tions; but his great age, &s;o re&s;pectable in the Ea&s;t, pleaded in his behalf. One of the attendants went to the bey, and told him an aged man, apparently mi|&s;erable, reque&s;ted an audience. Let him enter, re|plied <HI>Mourad,</HI> and the farmer proceeded, with trem|bling &s;teps, over the rich carpet, which be&s;pread the hall of the divan, and approached the bey, who re|clined on a &s;opha embroidered with &s;ilk and gold. Crowding &s;en&s;ations deprived him of the u&s;e of &s;peech;
<PB N="328" REF="337">
at la&s;t, after attentively looking, the voice of nature vanqui&s;hing fear, he fell; and, embracing his knees, exclaimed, You are my &s;on! The bey rai&s;ed him, en|deavoured to recollect, and, after finding him to be his father, made him &s;it down by his &s;ide, and care&s;&s;ed him mo&s;t affectionately. The fir&s;t gu&s;h of nature over, the fire de&s;cribed in what deplorable &s;tate he had left his mother, and brethren, whom the prince propo&s;ed to &s;end for, and, with them, divide his riches and power; if they would embrace I&s;lani&s;m. This the generous Chri&s;tian had fore&s;een; and, fearing youth might be dazzled, took not one of his &s;ons with him. He therefore firmly rejected <HI>Mourad</HI>'s offer, and even remon&s;trated with him, on his own change of religion. The bey finding his father determined, and that his fa|mily's di&s;tre&s;s demanded immediate &s;uccour, &s;ent him back to Syria, with a large &s;um of money, and a ve&s;&s;el loaded with corn. The happy hu&s;bandman immedi|diately returned to the plains of Dama&s;cus, where his arrival bani&s;hed mi&s;ery and tears from his homely roof, and brought joy, ea&s;e and fe&s;tivity.&mdash;This hi&s;|tory greatly re&s;embles that of <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> and would more, perhaps, did we know every incident attend|ing it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the different Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>AMID tho&s;e revolutions which all nations have experienced, there are few countries which have pre&s;erved their original, and primitive inhabi|tants pure, and unmixed. The &s;ame de&s;ire which leads individuals to encroach on each other's property, has excited nations one again&s;t another; the con&s;e|quence of which has been, to introduce into &s;tates a foreign conqueror, who has de&s;poiled the vanqui&s;hed nation of the domain, granted them by nature.</P>
<P>Such has been the ca&s;e with Egypt: deprived three-and-twenty centuries ago, of her natural pro|prietors, &s;he has &s;een her fertile fields, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a prey to the Per&s;ians, the Macedonians, the Romans, the Greeks, the Arabs, the Georgians, and, at length, the race of Tartars, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Ot|toman Turks. Among &s;o many nations, &s;everal of them have left ve&s;tiges of their tran&s;ient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but as they have been blended in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, they
<PB N="330" REF="340">
have been &s;o con&s;ounded, as to render it very diffi|cult to di&s;criminate their re&s;pective characters.</P>
<P>The real native Egyptians, according to <HI>Savary,</HI> are the Copts; called &s;o from Cophtos, once a famous city in the Thebais; or from <HI>cobtos,</HI> cut; becau&s;e they have always pre&s;erved the u&s;e of circumci&s;ion. The&s;e only are the de&s;cendants of the ancient Egyptians; and who, more than two hundred years, &s;ubjected by foreign powers, have lo&s;t the genius and &s;cience of their forefathers; though they have pre&s;erved their cu&s;toms, and the ancient vulgar tongue.</P>
<P>The knowledge tran&s;mitted from father to &s;on, of all arable lands, their value and extent, occa&s;ions them to be cho&s;en clerks to the beys; and, that they may conceal their accounts from the&s;e lords, mo&s;t of them are written in Coptic. They do not, however, perfectly under&s;tand the language; but, as their mi&s;|&s;als, and the various other works they po&s;&s;e&s;s, have an Arabic language, their ancient language is not lo&s;t; and in &s;ome future time it may, perhaps, &s;upply the learned with means of di&s;pelling the ob&s;curity of the fir&s;t ages, and removing the veil from my&s;terious hie|roglyphics.</P>
<P>The Copts embraced Chri&s;tianity at its birth; and <HI>Amrou,</HI> having conquered Egypt, permitted them
<PB N="331" REF="341">
the free exerci&s;e of the Chri&s;tian religion; &s;ince when they have even had churches, prie&s;ts, bi&s;hops, and a patriarch, who&s;e re&s;idence is at Grand Cairo. Nu|merous &s;uper&s;titious practices, received from their an|ce&s;tors, are mingled in their wor&s;hip; but they are mild, humane and ho&s;pitable. Paternal tenderne&s;s and filial love con&s;titute their dome&s;tic happine&s;s, where every tie of blood is cheri&s;hed and ho|noured. Inland trade, the art of hatching eggs and rai&s;ing bees, are almo&s;t the whole of their knowledge. They often enrich them&s;elves by the admini&s;trations entru&s;ted to them; but they &s;eldom enjoy tranquility, the fruits of their labours. The bey, who beholds them opulent, often &s;trips them of their riches, without mercy. Such oppre&s;&s;ions do not excite revolt; their want of energy keeps them en|chained in poverty and &s;ubjection, which they &s;upport without murmuring.</P>
<P>After the Copts, the Arabs are the mo&s;t ancient people of Egypt, where they twice have reigned. Their fir&s;t dominion was in the remote ages of anti|quity. The &s;econd began in the &s;eventh, and ended in the twelfth century. Two-thirds of the pre&s;ent inhabitants are Arabs; the manners of whom differ according to their mode of life. Tho&s;e who become hu&s;bandmen are governed by their foreign ma&s;ters, and pre&s;ent a &s;triking example to philo&s;ophers, of the
<PB N="332" REF="342">
influence of laws over men. Beneath a tyrannical government, they have lo&s;t that good faith, which characterizes their nation. They take part in their ma&s;ter's quarrels. Villages arm again&s;t villages, and towns again&s;t towns; and, during the revolutions, continually reviving at Grand Cairo, the country pre&s;ents a frightful &s;cene of carnage and horror. It is the&s;e degenerate Arabs, who render the navigation of the Nile exceedingly dangerous, attack boats in the dark, ma&s;&s;acre pa&s;&s;engers, &s;eize their effects, and commit every kind of outrage.</P>
<P>Another divi&s;ion of the Arabs, who may be called hu&s;bandmen, are governed by their &s;heiks, who po&s;|&s;e&s;s various principalities in the Thebais. Now, as heretofore, they are the judge, the pontiff, and the &s;overeign of their people; yet governing more like fathers of families, than kings. The&s;e venerable pa|triarchs u&s;ually take their meals at the doors of their hou&s;es, or tents, inviting all comers: ri&s;ing from table they cry aloud, <HI>Whoever is hungry, let him in the name of God, come and eat,</HI> which is not a barren form; any man, whoever he may be, has a right to &s;it down, and feed on what he finds.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arabs are the be&s;t of people; ignorant of the vices of poli&s;hed nations, incapable of di&s;gui&s;e, they know neither fal&s;hood nor knavery. Haughty
<PB N="333" REF="343">
and generous, they repel in&s;ult by arms, and never employ treachery; ho&s;pitality is &s;acred among them, their hou&s;es and tents are open to travellers of all religions, and their gue&s;ts are treated with as much re&s;pect, and affection as their own kindred. Of their hone&s;ty &s;ome idea may be formed, by the following fact, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> to which I was a witne&s;s. An Arab &s;heik had long annually come to the di&s;trict of the French, where he took up goods on credit, of a mer|chant; &s;till coming the following year, at the &s;ame time, bringing the money, and taking fre&s;h merchan|dize. Sickne&s;s one year prevented him from coming him&s;elf, at the u&s;ual time; but he &s;ent his &s;on, with the money, and continued a trade, equally honourable to both nations.</P>
<P>A third &s;pecies of Arabs is comprized under the general name of Bedouai; of whom we have already given &s;ome account. They are divided into tribes, meddle not with agriculture, and feed on barley, dates, and the fle&s;h and milk of their herds, which they drive into the valleys, where they find water and pa&s;turage. Ma&s;ters of the de&s;arts, they are the ene|mies of all caravans, attack them wherever they can find them, and force them either to fight, or pay tri|bute. If the re&s;i&s;tance be too powerful, they retreat without fear of pur&s;uit; if they conquer, they pillage every one, divide the &s;poil, but never, as we have be|fore
<PB N="334" REF="344">
remarked, kill any one, unle&s;s to revenge the death of their companions.</P>
<P>After the mi&s;eries M. de S. <HI>Germain</HI> underwent, cro&s;&s;ing Suez, he came expiring to the tent of a Be|douin, to who&s;e generous care he owed his life; and who conducted him to Cairo, as &s;oon as his health was recovered. M. <HI>Pag&eacute;s</HI> fled over the &s;ands of Arabia De&s;erta, with &s;even Arabs; he had lo&s;t his water and provi&s;ions, and, falling from his camel, was in danger of being &s;acrificed to the re&s;entment of an in&s;ulted tribe. One of his companions al|lighted, and, at the ri&s;k of his life, took him up be|hind him, till they came to a place of &s;afety. The whole provi&s;ion of the Arabs, during the journey, was a barley cake a day, and that not a large one. This they divided into eight portions; and the one they gave the &s;tranger was always twice as much as their own.</P>
<P>Of the misfortunes attending M. de S. <HI>Germain, Volney</HI> has given a more particular relation. The ca|ravan he accompanied, it appears, was compo&s;ed of Engli&s;h officers and pa&s;&s;engers, who had landed from two ve&s;&s;els at Suez, in their way to Europe by Cairo. The Bedouin Arabs of Tor, informed that their pa&s;|&s;engers were richly laden, re&s;olved to plunder them, and attacked them five leagues from Suez. The Eu|ropeans,
<PB N="335" REF="345">
&s;tripped &s;tark naked, and di&s;per&s;ed by fear, &s;e|parated into two parties. Some returned to Suez; the remainder, to the number of &s;even, thinking they could reach Cairo, pu&s;hed forward into the de&s;art. Fatigue, thir&s;t, hunger, and the heat of the &s;un, de|&s;troyed them, one after the other. M. de S. <HI>Germain</HI> alone &s;urvived all the&s;e horrors. During three days, and two nights, he wandered in this bare and &s;andy de&s;art, frozen at night by the North wind, (for it was in the month of January) and burnt by the &s;un during the day, without any other &s;hade but a &s;ingle bu&s;h, into which he thru&s;t his head among the thorns; or any other drink but his own urine. At length, on the third day, perceiving the water of <HI>Berket-el-Hadj,</HI> he &s;trove to make toward it; but he had already fallen three times, from weakne&s;s, and would have remained where he la&s;t fell, but for an Arab, mounted on a ca|mel, who &s;aw him at a great di&s;tance. This cha|ritable man conveyed him to his dwelling, and took care of him for three days, with the utmo&s;t humanity. At the expiration of that time he was conveyed to Cairo, where he arrived in a mo&s;t deplorable condition. His body was one entire wound, his breath cadave|rous, and he had &s;carcely a &s;park of life remaining. By dint of great care and attention, he was at la&s;t re|&s;tored to health. Much was &s;aid, at the time, of the barbarity of the Arabs, who notwith&s;tanding killed no one. At pre&s;ent, &s;ays <HI>Volney,</HI> we may venture to
<PB N="336" REF="346">
blame the imprudence of the Europeans, who con|ducted them&s;elves like madmen throughout the whole affair. So great was the di&s;cord among them, and they had carried their negligence &s;o far, as not to have a &s;ingle pi&s;tol fit for u&s;e. All their arms were at the bottom of their che&s;ts. Be&s;ides, it appears that the Arabs did not act merely from their u&s;ual motives; well-informed per&s;ons a&s;&s;ert, that the affair was tran&s;|acted at Con&s;tantinople, by the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company's Agents;</HI> who &s;aw, with a jealous eye, indi|viduals entering into a competition with them for the traffic of Bengal; and what has pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of enquiries into the event, has proved the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>An exce&s;&s;ive love of liberty occa&s;ions them to prefer the dreary wilderne&s;s, where they lived in|dependent, to the rich plains of Egypt, where they mu&s;t live as &s;laves. Government has &s;everal times of|fered them lands, which they have con&s;tantly refu&s;ed; and this independent &s;pirit, &s;o well pourtrayed in the &s;acred &s;criptures, they have inviolably pre&s;erved from the time of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> their father. Liberty has &s;o many charms, that, to obtain it, they firmly &s;upport hunger, thir&s;t, and the &s;corching &s;un. Sometimes humbled, but never en&s;laved, they have braved all the powers of the earth; and &s;hook off the chain, in which other nations have alternately been bound.
<PB N="337" REF="347">
The Romans, ma&s;ters of the world, lo&s;t the armies they &s;ent to conquer their country. The Egyptians, Per&s;ians and Ottomans, never could &s;ubdue them. Thus this proud people is the &s;ole nation, which has pre&s;erved that haughtine&s;s of character, genero&s;ity, and inviolable fidelity, which &s;o highly honour huma|nity. Deceit and perjury they know not. Ignorant of, though not de&s;pi&s;ing, &s;cience; &s;ound rea&s;on, up|rightne&s;s and elevation of &s;oul, di&s;tingui&s;h them from all the Orientals. The&s;e are the Arabs which the genius of a &s;ingle man united, to the de&s;truction of the thrones, the conquering of kingdoms, and the im|po&s;ing of laws on two-thirds of the earth. Their con|que&s;ts are lo&s;t, but their character, religion, and man|ners are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Except the Copts and Arabs, the Mograbians, or We&s;tern Mahometans, are the mo&s;t numerous inhabi|tants of Egypt; they devote them&s;elves, &s;ome to trade, and &s;ome to arms. Their nation ought not to be judged by the individuals of Grand Cairo: tho&s;e who become &s;oldiers are adventurers, mo&s;t of them guilty of crimes, and bani&s;hed from their country by the fear of ju&s;tice. The&s;e mercile&s;s, faithle&s;s, lawle&s;s &s;ol|diers, abandon them&s;elves to every exce&s;s, and always &s;ell them&s;elves to that Bey, who is the be&s;t bidder.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="348">The number of real Turks here, is not great, ex|clu&s;ive of the Jani&s;&s;aries and A&s;&s;abs; who, abu&s;ing their power, pillage the Egyptians, and foreigners, and employ every means to ama&s;s great riches. Like the Mograbians, they are neither di&s;ciplined, under|&s;tand the art of gunnery, nor would it be po&s;&s;ible for them to oppo&s;e the military &s;cience of Europeans.</P>
<P>The Syrian Chri&s;tians, Greeks, and Jews, addict them&s;elves entirely to commerce, exchange, and the mechanic arts. Their ductile cunning, promotes them occa&s;ionally to be commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms, and receivers of the revenue in Egypt; but their ho|ne&s;ty may not be depended on, and their arts &s;hould always be watched. Having obtained power, they employ it to oppre&s;s European merchants, invent ex|actions, and &s;hackle their commerce. Many of them are gold&s;miths, and work in gold, &s;ilver, and jewellery, with tolerable &s;kill. Their performances in fillagree are valuable. Several of them have e&s;tabli&s;hed ma|nufactories of light &s;tuffs, made from Bengal cotton, and the &s;ilk of Syria, which are purcha&s;ed by the natives. Though well woven, the&s;e &s;tuffs fail in the dye, the colour being neither &s;o vivid, nor &s;o unfading as tho&s;e of India, which mu&s;t be attributed to the ig|norance of the arti&s;ts; for Egypt produces excellent indigo, carthamus, and various dyes. Their linen cloths have the &s;ame defect. Egyptian flax, formerly
<PB N="339" REF="349">
&s;o renowned for its excellence, is &s;till the &s;ame; but, the &s;pinners are &s;o bad, that their linen is very coar&s;e.</P>
<P>The amount of the&s;e inhabitants, &s;o different in their manners, religion, and nations, is near four millions; the&s;e are governed and kept in order, by eight thou&s;and Mamluks. A matter not &s;urpri&s;ing, if we recollect, that under <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> three cohorts, amounting to about three thou&s;and men, were &s;uffi|cient to guard the Thebais, or Upper Egypt; as <HI>Strabo</HI> informs us, who, was an ocular witne&s;s of the fact.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Character, Private Life, Food, Occupations, Amu&s;ements.</HEAD>
<P>LIFE, in the capital of Egypt, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is rather pa&s;&s;ive, than active. Nine months in the year, the body is oppre&s;&s;ed by heat; and the &s;oul, in a &s;tate of apathy, &s;ighs after calm tranquility. In|action, under a temperate clime, is painful; here re|po&s;e
<PB N="340" REF="350">
is enjoyment. The mo&s;t frequent &s;alutation at meeting, or parting, is, <HI>peace be with you.</HI> Effeminate indolence is born with the Egyptian, grows with his growth, and de&s;cends with him to the grave. It is the vice of the climate; it influences his inclinations, and governs his actions. The &s;ofa, therefore, is the mo&s;t luxurious piece of furniture in an apartment. Their gardens have charming arbours, but no walks. The European, born under a varying &s;ky, is active, impatient, and agitated, like the atmo&s;phere in which he lives; while the Egyptian, feeling the &s;ame heat, and the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation, two thirds of the year, is idle, &s;olemn, and patient.</P>
<P>He ri&s;es with the &s;un to enjoy the morning air; purifies him&s;elf, and repeats the appointed prayer. His pipe and coffee are brought him, and be reclines at his ea&s;e on his &s;ofa. Slaves, with their arms cro&s;|&s;ed, remain &s;ilent at the farther end of the chamber, with their eyes fixed on him, &s;eeking to anticipate his wants. His children &s;tanding in his pre&s;ence, unle&s;s he permits them to be &s;eated, pre&s;erve every appear|ance of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect: he gravely care&s;&s;es them, gives them his ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;ends them back to the harem.</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t ended, he tran&s;acts the bu&s;ine&s;s of his trade, or office; and as to di&s;putes, they are few, a|mong
<PB N="341" REF="351">
a people where the name of attorney is un|known; and where each man is his own pleader.</P>
<P>When vi&s;itors come, they are received without many compliments, but in an endearing manner. His equals are &s;eated cro&s;s-legged, be&s;ide him; his infe|riors kneel, and fit upon their hams. People of di&s;|tinction, are placed on a rai&s;ed &s;ofa. This is nearly the general cu&s;tom throughout Turkey, and &s;eems to be the cu&s;tom, not only of the pre&s;ent, but of ancient times. Thus, according to <HI>Virgil, Aeneas</HI> in the pa|lace of <HI>Dido,</HI> had the place of honour; while, &s;eated on a rai&s;ed bed, he related to the queen, the burning of Troy. When every per&s;on is &s;eated, the &s;laves bring pipes and coffee, and &s;et the perfume bra&s;ier in the middle of the chamber, and afterwards pre&s;ent &s;weetmeats and &s;herbet.</P>
<P>The tobacco, &s;moaked in Egypt, is brought from Syria, in leaf, and cut by them into long filaments; it is not &s;o acrid as that of America; and, to render it more agreeable, they mix with it the odorous wood of aloes. Their pipes are u&s;ually of ja&s;min, the end gar|ni&s;hed with amber, and often enriched with precious &s;tones: they are very long; the vapour imbibed, is therefore very mild. The Orientals pretend, it agree|ably irritates the palate, while it gratifies the &s;mell. Some of their pipes are fifteen feet long.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="352">When the vi&s;it is almo&s;t ended, a &s;lave, bearing a &s;ilver plate, in which e&s;&s;ences are burning, goes round to the company; and each, in turn, perfumes his beard, and &s;prinkles ro&s;e-water on his head and hands. Thus, the ancient cu&s;tom of perfuming the head and beard; as &s;ung by the royal prophet, "Like the pre|cious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even upon Aaron's beard," is &s;till continued. <HI>Anacreon,</HI> the father of the fe&s;tive ode, and the poet of the graces, ince&s;&s;antly repeats, "I delight to &s;prin|kle my body with precious perfumes, and crown my head with ro&s;es."</P>
<P>About noon, the table is prepared, and the viands brought in a large tray of tinned copper; and though in no great variety, yet always in great plenty. In the centre, is a mountain of rice cooked with poultry, and highly &s;ea&s;oned with &s;pice and &s;affron. Round this are ha&s;hed meats, pigeons, &s;tuffed cucumbers, de|licious melons and fruits. The roa&s;t meats are cut &s;mall, laid over with the fat of the animal, &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt, &s;pitted, and done on the coals; they are tender and &s;ucculent. The gue&s;ts &s;eat them&s;elves on a carpet, round the table; a &s;lave brings water in one hand, and a ba&s;on in the other, to wa&s;h. This is an indi&s;pen&s;able ceremony, where each per&s;on puts his hand in the di&s;h, and where the u&s;e of forks is un|known;
<PB N="343" REF="353">
it is repeated when the meal is ended. The&s;e cu&s;toms of the Ea&s;t, appear to be very ancient.</P>
<P><HI>Menelaus,</HI> and the beauteous <HI>Helen,</HI> having loaded <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> with gifts, gave them a ho&s;|pitable banquet.</P>
<Q><L>And now when through the royal dome they pa&s;s'd,</L>
<L>High on a throne the king each &s;tranger plac'd.</L>
<L>A golden ewer, th' attendant dam&s;el brings,</L>
<L>Replete with water, from the cry&s;tal &s;prings.</L>
<L>With copious &s;treams, the &s;hining va&s;e &s;upplies,</L>
<L>A &s;ilver laver of capacious &s;ize.</L>
<L>They wa&s;h. The tables in fair order &s;pread,</L>
<L>The glitt'ring canni&s;ters are crown'd with bread!</L>
<L>Viands of various kinds, allure the ta&s;te</L>
<L>Of choice&s;t &s;ort, and &s;avour rich repa&s;t!</L>
<BIBL>ODYS. XV.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The manner, in which the &s;on of <HI>Thetis</HI> received the Greek deputies, very much re&s;embles that in which the Egyptians treat their gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>After dinner, the Egyptians retire to the harem, where they flumber &s;ome hours, amid&s;t their wives and children. A commodious and agreeable place of repo&s;e is extreme luxury to them. Thus, <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who neglected nothing that might &s;educe, tells his fol|lowers,
<PB N="344" REF="354">
that the inhabitants of Paradi&s;e enjoy the &s;weets of repo&s;e, and have a place mo&s;t delightful to &s;leep in at neon.</P>
<P>The poor having neither &s;ofa nor harem, lie down on the mat on which they have dined. Thus, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> at the la&s;t &s;upper, &s;uffered his beloved di&s;ciple to repo&s;e his head upon his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary in the evening to go on the water, or breathe the fre&s;h air of the banks of the Nile, beneath the orange and &s;ycamore-trees. An hour after &s;un-&s;et, &s;upper is &s;erved up, con&s;i&s;ting of rice, poultry, vegetables, and fruits, which are very &s;alu|tary during the heats: the &s;tomach requires the&s;e, and would reject more &s;olid food. Moderation in eating, is the virtue of the climate.</P>
<P>Such is the ordinary life of the Egyptians. Our &s;hews, plays, and plea&s;ures are to them unknown; a monotony, which, to an European would be death, is delight to an Egyptian. Their days are pa&s;t in re|peating the &s;ame thing, in following the &s;ame cu&s;toms, without a wi&s;h or thought beyond. The lower cla&s;s of people, however, are very fond of li&s;tening to the tales and tricks of conjurors.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="355">Among the other diver&s;ions, by which the jugglers delude the common people out of their money, is that of leading about dancing camels. The&s;e animals are taught to dance when young, by being brought upon a heated floor, which gives them a good deal of pain, and cau&s;es them to lift up their legs as if they were dancing, while they keep beating time with a drum; and this practice they continue for about half a year; after which time, when the camel hears the noi&s;e of a drum, he &s;trikes into a dance. The for|tune-tellers, have likewi&s;e a trick of breeding up lit|tle birds, which, when any per&s;on applies to them to have his fortune told, bring him a &s;crip of paper, in which his future de&s;tiny is written.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, as their name imports, had their origin in this country. They are called by the Turks, Zinganees, from <HI>Zinganeus,</HI> their leader; who, with a great many Egyptians, retired into the de&s;arts, when &s;ultan <HI>Selim</HI> took Egypt from the Mamluks; where they increa&s;ed to &s;o formidable a number, making incur&s;ions, from time to time, in the plain, that the Turks were glad to enter into a treaty with them; by which it was agreed, they &s;hould lay down their arms, and be allowed the &s;ame privileges as other &s;ubjects, in exerci&s;ing any trade, or means of live|lihood. But the Zinganees, having been accu&s;tomed to a vagabond wandering life, and lo&s;t all ideas of re|ligion,
<PB N="346" REF="356">
were aver&s;e to change their mode of living, and &s;till continued to follow their former cour&s;e of ra|pine and plunder. And the Turks, finding they could not be reclaimed, were obliged to bani&s;h them the country; of cour&s;e, a power was given to any per&s;on to kill a Zinganee; or make a &s;lave of him, if di&s;co|vered in the country after a limited time. This law was &s;o well enforced, that a Zinganee was not to be &s;een in Egypt for many years after. They had agreed to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, in &s;mall parties, all over the world; and, being natives of Egypt, a country where the occult &s;ciences, or black art, as it was called, had, in the opinion of credulous people, ri&s;en to great per|fection, they thought they could not pitch upon a more effectual means of gaining &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and, at the &s;ame time, indulge their wandering way of life, than by &s;etting up for fortune-tellers.</P>
<P>Egypt, however, as well as Italy, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> has her <HI>improvi&s;atore,</HI> called <HI>Almai,</HI> or learned; which title they obtain, by being more educated than other women. They form a cla&s;s very famous in the coun|try; to be admitted into which, it is nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s a fine voice, eloquence, the rules of grammar, and be able to compo&s;e and &s;ing extempore ver&s;es, adapted to the occa&s;ion.</P>

They place them in a rai&s;ed orche&s;tra, or pulpit, where they &s;ing during the fea&s;t; after which, they de&s;cend, and form dances, which no w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y re&s;embles ours. They are pantomimes, that repre&s;ent the com|mon incidents of life. Love is their u&s;ual &s;ubject. The &s;upplene&s;s of their dancers' bodies, is inconceiv|able; and the flexibility of their features, which take impre&s;&s;ions of the parts they play at will, is a&s;toni&s;h|ing. The indecency of their attitudes is often exce&s;|&s;ive; each look, each ge&s;ture, &s;peaks; and, in a man|ner &s;o forcible, as not po&s;&s;ibly to be mi&s;under&s;tood. They throw a&s;ide mode&s;ty with their veils When they begin to dance, a long and very light &s;ilk robe floats on the ground, negligently girded by a &s;a&s;h: long black hair, perfumed, and in tre&s;&s;es, de&s;cends over their &s;houlders; the &s;hift, tran&s;parent as gauze, &s;carcely conceals the &s;kin: as the act on proceeds, the various forms and contours that the body can a&s;&s;ume, &s;eem progre&s;&s;ive; the &s;ound of mu&s;ica in&s;truments re|gulates their &s;teps Words adap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to &s;uch like &s;cenes inflame them &s;till more, until they appear intoxica|ted, and become frantic bacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ants.

<P>The&s;e almai, are admitted into all harems; where they teach the women the new airs, recount amorous tales, and recite poems in their pre&s;ence, which are intere&s;ting, by being pictures of their own manners. They teach them the my&s;teries of their art, and in|&s;truct them in la&s;civious dances. The minds of the&s;e women are cultivated, their conver&s;ation is agreeable, they &s;peak their language with purity; and habitually addicting them&s;elves to poetry, learn the mo&s;t winning and &s;onorous modes of expre&s;&s;ion. Their recital is very graceful; when they &s;ing, nature is their only guide. Some of their airs are light and gay; but their excellence is mo&s;tly &s;een in the pathetic. When they rehear&s;e a tale, in the manner of the ancient tragic ballad, by dwelling upon affecting and plaintive tones, they in&s;pire melancholy; which in&s;en&s;ibly aug|ments, till it melts into tears. The very Turks, ene|mies as they are to the arts, pa&s;s whole nights in li&s;ten|ing to them. Two people &s;ing together occa&s;ionally; but, like their orche&s;tra, they are always in uni&s;on. Accompaniments in mu&s;ic, are only for enlightened nations; who, while melody charms the ear, wi&s;h to have the mind employed by a ju&s;t and inventive mo|dulation.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="360">The I&s;raelites, to whom Egyptian manners, by long dwelling in Egypt, were become natural, had al&s;o their almai. At Jeru&s;alem, as at Cairo, they gave the women le&s;&s;ons. St. <HI>Mark,</HI> relates a fact, which proves the power of the Oriental dance over the heart of man. He tells us, that <HI>Herod</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed with his daughter's dancing on &s;ome great fe&s;tival, as to bid her a&s;k any favour of him &s;he thought proper, and that he would grant it; upon which, at the de&s;ire of her mother, &s;he reque&s;ted the head of <HI>John</HI> the Bap|ti&s;t, which was immediately brought her in a charger.</P>
<P>The almai, are pre&s;ent at marriage ceremonies, and precede the bride, playing on in&s;truments. They al&s;o accompany funerals, at which they &s;ing dirges, utter groans and lamentations, and imitate every mark of grief and de&s;pair. Their price is high, and they &s;eldom attend any but wealthy people, and men of high rank.</P>
<P>I was invited, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> to a &s;plendid &s;upper, given by a rich Venetian merchant, to the receiver-general of the finances of Egypt. The almai &s;ung various airs, during the banquet; and afterwards the prai&s;es of the principal gue&s;ts. The mo&s;t plea&s;ing part of this performance, was an ingenious allegory, in which Cupid was the &s;uppo&s;ed interlocutor. There was a play after &s;upper, and handfuls of &s;equins were
<PB N="350" REF="361">
&s;ent to the &s;ingers. This fe&s;tival, brought them at lea&s;t fifty guineas: they are not, however, always &s;o well paid.</P>
<P>The common people have always their almai, who are a &s;econd order of the&s;e women, imitators of the fir&s;t; but have neither their elegance, grace, or knowledge. They are &s;een every where; the pub|lic &s;quares and walks, round Grand Cairo, abound with them; the populace require ideas to be conveyed with &s;till le&s;s di&s;gui&s;e; decency will not permit the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of their motions, and po&s;tures to be de&s;cribed; of which no idea can be formed but by &s;eeing them. The Indian <HI>Bayadieres,</HI> are exemplarily mode&s;t, when compared to the dancing girls of the Egyptians. This is the principle diver&s;ion of the&s;e people, and one in which they take great delight.</P>

were no ladies in the a&s;&s;embly, it was not the mo&s;t lively party in the world; but, being new to me, was for that rea&s;on entertaining.</P>
<P>Being a &s;tranger, I was a kind of &s;ight to them, and they a&s;ked me numberle&s;s que&s;tions; at the &s;ame time being extremely civil, and &s;everal of them as a com|pliment, taking their pipes out of their mouths, and offering them to me to &s;moke; although the indelicacy of this cu&s;tom was &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ting, yet, in con|formity to their manners, I took their pipes, &s;moked two or three whiffs and returned them. They look upon it as the mo&s;t civil thing they can do, to a &s;tran|ger, or vi&s;itor, to offer him the di&s;h of coffee they them|&s;elves are &s;ipping, or the pipe they are &s;moking, which it would be the height of ill manners in any one to refu&s;e. Our &s;upper was &s;erved at twelve o'clock, and con&s;i&s;ted of &s;weetmeats, pa&s;try, and &s;herbets, &s;erved on &s;ilver waiters, placed on the carpet, around which we formed our&s;elves in different parties, of five or &s;ix in each: we did not continue long at table, and immediately; as our repa&s;t was fini&s;hed, the company broke up.</P>
<P>Among other amu&s;ements, in which the people of Grand Cairo take great delight, are the tricks of apes; great numbers of which are &s;een in the &s;treets. They are brought by the Arabs from Mecca, who teach
<PB N="352" REF="363">
them different anticks for diver&s;ion. The Arabs being naturally inclined to buffoonery, their genius bears no &s;mall re&s;emblance to the in&s;tinct of apes, and affords much amu&s;ement to tho&s;e who accompany their caravans. Among other droll &s;tories of the cunning and &s;agacity of the&s;e animals, the following is related from <HI>Le Brun.</HI></P>
<P>An ape, kept by one of the Arabs, u&s;ed to remain in the kitchen while the victuals were dre&s;&s;ing, to pre|vent the hawks from &s;tealing any thing away. Hawks are very numerous in the&s;e countries, and collect to|gether on the tops of hou&s;es, in order to &s;natch up whatever they &s;ee within their reach. The chimnies being very low, and very wide, enables them to dive down, and carry off any provi&s;ions that may be lying on the hearth. It happened one day that this Arab, having put a piece of meat into the pot, went out, and not returning again &s;oon, it boiled over, and the meat remained uncovered. A hawk, who was on the look out, upon the top of the chimney, perceiving this, was very de&s;irous of the meat; and flying down, ventured to &s;eize upon it, and carried it up the chim|ney. The ape, who &s;aw him&s;elf tricked, ca&s;t a very &s;orrowful look up the chimney; and, fore&s;eeing the ill u&s;age he &s;hould meet with from his ma&s;ter, endea|voured to avoid the &s;torm by an artifice of his own. He argued, therefore, with him&s;elf in this manner:
<PB N="353" REF="364">
"The hawk that has done me this injury, after he has devoured his prey, will, no doubt, return to &s;ee if there be any thing more left for him." And the fire being out, he clapped him&s;elf in the pot, and turning his bare buttocks upwards, thought the hawk might take him for another piece of fle&s;h. In &s;hort, the hawk being returned, and looking from the top of the chimney, &s;tooped down on what he &s;aw in the pot; and the ape, who was on the catch, turning him&s;elf round very dexterou&s;ly, &s;eized on the falcon, chopped off his head, and put him into the pot. The Arab, on returning home, went to look at the meat he had put on the fire; and, perceiving the metamorpho&s;is, looked very angrily on the ape. But this creature making a leap, took the hawk out of the pot, clapped him&s;elf into it, in the &s;ame po&s;ture he had done at fir&s;t, and &s;hewed by &s;everal ge&s;tures, that the hawk had taken away the meat, and the manner in which he &s;ur|pri&s;ed him, and put him into the pot. From this one in&s;tance, it is ea&s;y to conceive how many &s;tories of the like nature, the&s;e creatures would furni&s;h, and to which the Italian proverb is very applicable: <HI>&s;i non &eacute; vero, &eacute; ben trovato;</HI> i. e. <HI>if not true, it is well|invented.</HI></P>
<P>Having now de&s;cribed the mode of life that the men lead, we will endeavour to give a general idea of female manners in this country. In Europe, women
<PB N="354" REF="365">
act parts of great con&s;equence, and often reign &s;ove|reigns on the world's va&s;t theatre. How different in Egypt, where they are bowed down by the fetters of &s;lavery, condemned to &s;ervitude, and have no influ|ence in public affairs. The Egyptians never even mention their wives in conver&s;ation; or, if obliged to &s;peak of them, they &s;ay the mother of &s;uch a per|&s;on, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, &amp;c. Good manners will not permit the vi&s;itor to a&s;k; How does your wife do, Sir? But in imitation of their re&s;erve, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, How does the mother of &s;uch a per&s;on do? And even this they think an in&s;ult, unle&s;s a&s;ked by a kin&s;man, or an intimate friend.</P>
<P>Subject to the immutable laws by which cu&s;tom governs the Ea&s;t, the women do not a&s;&s;ociate with men; not even at table, where the union of &s;exes produces mirth and wit, and makes food &s;weet. When the great dine with one of their wives, &s;he is pre|viou&s;ly informed, prepares the apartment accordingly, perfumes it with precious e&s;&s;ences, procures the mo&s;t delicate viands, and receives her lord with the utmo&s;t attention and re&s;pect. Among the common people, the women u&s;ually &s;tand or &s;it in the corner of the room, while the hu&s;band dines; often hold the ba&s;on for him to wa&s;h, and &s;erve him at table. Cu&s;toms like the&s;e, which the Europeans rightly call barba|rous, and exclaim again&s;t, appear &s;o natural here,
<PB N="355" REF="366">
that they do not &s;u&s;pect it can be otherwi&s;e el&s;ewhere. Such is the power of habit over man. What has been for ages, he &s;uppo&s;es, a law of nature.</P>
<P>I lately dined with an Italian, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> who had married an Egyptian woman, and having lived there long, a&s;&s;umed their habits. His wife and &s;i&s;ter-in-law &s;tood in my pre&s;ence; and it was with difficulty I prevailed on them to &s;it at table with us, where they were extremely timid and di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>The women in Egypt overlook their hou&s;hold, and do not think them&s;elves deba&s;ed, by preparing them|&s;elves their own food, and that of their hu&s;bands. Former cu&s;toms &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, render their cares duties. Thus, <HI>Sarah</HI> ha&s;tened to bake cakes upon the hearth, when angels vi&s;ited <HI>Abraham,</HI> who per|formed the rights of ho&s;pitality. <HI>Sarah</HI> likewi&s;e, who prepared the dinner for <HI>Abraham</HI> and his gue&s;ts, &s;at not at table, but remained in her tent.</P>
<P>Though thus employed, the Egyptian women have much lei&s;ure, which they &s;pend among their &s;laves; embroidering &s;a&s;hes, making veils, tracing de&s;igns to decorate their &s;ofas, and in &s;pinning. Such <HI>Homer</HI> painted the women of his time. Labour has al&s;o its relaxations; plea&s;ure is not bani&s;hed the harem. Chearful and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;ongs are accompanied by the
<PB N="356" REF="367">
&s;laves, with the tambour de ba&s;que and with ca&s;tanets. Sometimes the almai come to enliven the &s;cene with their dances, and affecting recitals, and by relating amorous romances; and, at the clo&s;e of the day, there is an amorous repa&s;t, in which exqui&s;ite fruits and perfumes are &s;erved with profu&s;ion. Thus do they endeavour to charm away the dulne&s;s of cap|tivity.</P>
<P>Not that they are wholly pri&s;oners; once or twice a week they are permitted to go to the bath, and vi&s;it female relations and friends. To bewail the dead, is likewi&s;e a duty they are allowed to perform. I have often &s;een di&s;tracted mothers round Cairo, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> reciting funeral hymns, over the tombs they had be|&s;trewed with odoriferous plants. Thus, <HI>Hecuba</HI> and <HI>Andromache</HI> lamented over the body of <HI>Hector;</HI> and thus, <HI>Fatima</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> wept over <HI>Mahomet.</HI> We will here in&s;ert the complaint of <HI>Fatima,</HI> the daugh|ther of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> that of <HI>Andromache,</HI> may be &s;een in the twenty-fourth book of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Iliad.</P>

<P>Then, taking a little of the du&s;t from the coffin, and putting it to her face, &s;he adds,</P>
<P>"Who, having &s;melt the du&s;t of his tomb, can ever find odour in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfumes? Alas! every agreeable &s;en&s;ation is extinct in my heart! The clouds of &s;orrow envelop me, and will change the brightne&s;s of day, to the darkne&s;s of night!"</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom was not unknown to the Romans; they had their funeral urns &s;trewed with cypre&s;s. How charmingly does the elegant <HI>Horace</HI> &s;hed flowers over that of <HI>Quinctilius!</HI> How affecting, how pa&s;&s;ion|ate, is the ode he addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Virgil,</HI> on the death of their common friend! Among European nations, where ties of kindred are much relaxed, they rid them|&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, of the religious duties which ancient piety paid the dead; but the rea&s;on why we die unregretted is, becau&s;e we have had the misfor|tune to live unbeloved.</P>
<P>The Egyptian women receive each others vi&s;its very affectionately; when a lady enters the harem,
<PB N="358" REF="369">
the mi&s;tre&s;s ri&s;es, takes her hand, pre&s;&s;es it to her bo&s;om, ki&s;&s;es her, and makes her &s;it down by her &s;ide; a &s;lave ha&s;tens to take her black mantle; &s;he is entreated to be at ea&s;e, quits her veil and her out|ward garment, and di&s;covers a floating robe, tied round the wai&s;t with a &s;a&s;h, which perfectly di&s;plays her &s;hape. She then receives compliments accord|ing to their manners. "Why, my mother, or my &s;i&s;ter, have you been &s;o long ab&s;ent? We &s;ighed to &s;ee you! Your pre&s;ence is an honour to our hou&s;e; it is the happine&s;s of our lives!" Such titles as madam, mi&s;s, mi&s;tre&s;s, are unknown in Egypt. A mother, ad|vanced in years, is called mother; when young, &s;i&s;ter; and if a girl, daughter of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Slaves pre&s;ent coffee, &s;herbet, and confectionary; they laugh, talk, and play; a large di&s;h is placed on the &s;ofa, on which are oranges, pomegranates, bana|nas, and excellent melons. Water, and ro&s;e-water, mixed, are brought in an ewer, and with them a &s;ilver ba&s;on to wa&s;h the hands, and loud glee and conver&s;a|tion &s;ea&s;on the repa&s;t. The chamber is perfumed by wood of aloes in a brazier; and the &s;laves afterwards dance to the &s;ound of cymbals, with whom the mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es often mingle. At parting, they &s;everal times repeat, God keep you in health! Heaven grant you a numerous offspring! Heaven pre&s;erve your chil|dren; the delight and glory of your family! The&s;e
<PB N="359" REF="370">
wi&s;hes, very ancient in the Ea&s;t, are found often in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>While a vi&s;itor is in the harem, the hu&s;band mu&s;t not enter; it is the a&s;ylum of ho&s;pitality, and cannot be violated without fatal con&s;equences; a cheri&s;hed right which the Egyptian women carefully maintain, being intere&s;ted in its pre&s;ervation. A lover, di&s;|gui&s;ed like a woman, may be introduced into the for|bidden place, and it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould remain un|di&s;covered; death would otherwi&s;e be his reward. In this country, where the pa&s;&s;ions are excited by the climate, and the difficulty of gratifying them, love often produces tragical events.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h women go guarded by their eunuchs, upon the water al&s;o, and enjoy the charming pro&s;pects of the banks of the Nile. Their cabins are plea&s;ant, richly embelli&s;hed, and the boats well carved and painted. They are known by the blinds over the windows, and the mu&s;ic by which they are accom|panied.</P>
<P>When they cannot go abroad, they endeavour to be merry in their pri&s;ons. Towards &s;un-&s;et, they re|pair to the terrace, and take the fre&s;h air among the flowers, which are there carefully reared. Here they often bathe; and thus at once, enjoy the cool, limpid
<PB N="360" REF="371">
water, the perfume of odoriferous plants, the balmy air, and the &s;tarry ho&s;t which &s;hines in the firmament. Thus bathed <HI>Bath&s;heba,</HI> when <HI>David</HI> beheld her from the roof of his palace.</P>
<P>The Turks oblige the public criers to &s;wear, they will &s;hut their eyes, when they call the people to prayer, that their wives may not be &s;een from the high mina|rets. Another more certain precaution they take is, to chu&s;e the blind to perform this pious function.</P>
<P>Such is the u&s;ual life of the Egyptian women. Their duties are, to educate their children, of which we &s;hall treat hereafter, to take care of their hou&s;hold, and live retired within their family: their plea&s;ure is to vi&s;it, give fea&s;ts, in which they often yield to ex|ce&s;&s;ive mirth, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s; go on the water, take the air in orange-groves, and li&s;ten to the almai.</P>
<P>The hot baths, known in the remote&s;t ages, and ce|lebrated by <HI>Homer,</HI> have pre&s;erved all their alure|ments and &s;alubrity. The baths have been already de&s;cribed, in our account of Turkey; of the manner of bathing in Egypt, it may not be ami&s;s to add &s;ome further particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="372">The bathers are not, as in this country, impri&s;oned in a kind of tub, where the body cannot re&s;t at its ea&s;e; but reclining on a &s;pread &s;heet, and the head &s;upported on a &s;mall pillow; they freely take what po&s;|ture they plea&s;e, while clouds of odoriferous vapours envelop and penetrate every pore.</P>
<P>Having repo&s;ed thus &s;ome time, a gentle moi&s;ture diffu&s;es it&s;elf over the body; a &s;ervant then comes, gently pre&s;&s;es, and turns the bather; and when the limbs are flexible, makes the joints crack without trouble; then touches lightly, and &s;eems to knead the body, without giving the &s;lighte&s;t &s;en&s;ation of pain.</P>
<P>This done, he puts on a &s;tuff glove, and continues rubbing, and freeing the &s;kin of the patient, which is quite wet, from every kind of &s;caly ob&s;truction, and all tho&s;e imperceptible particles that clog the pores, till it becomes as &s;mooth as &s;attin; he then conducts the bather into a cabinet, and pours a lather of per|fumed &s;oap on his head, and retires.</P>
<P>The ancients honoured their gue&s;ts &s;till more; and treated them after a mo&s;t voluptuous manner. Whil&s;t <HI>Telemachus</HI> was at the court of <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> "The beau|teous <HI>Polyca&s;te,</HI> younge&s;t of the daughters of the king of <HI>Pylos,</HI> led the &s;on of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to the bath, wa&s;hed him
<PB N="362" REF="373">
with her own hands; and, having rubbed his body with precious ointments, clothed him in rich garments, and a &s;hining mantle." Nor were <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> and <HI>Te|lemachus,</HI> wor&s;e treated in the palace of <HI>Menelaus;</HI> the beauties of which having admired, "they were con|ducted to marble ba&s;ons, in which the baths were pre|pared; where beauteous &s;laves wa&s;hed them, rubbed them with odorous oils, and clothed them in fine gar|ments, and magnificent furred robes."</P>
<P>The room into which the bather retires, has two water-cocks, one for cold, the other for hot water; and he wa&s;hes him&s;elf. The attendant pre&s;ently re|turns, with a depilatory pomatum, which in&s;tantly eradicates hair, wherever applied. It is in general u&s;e, both with men and women in Egypt.</P>
<P>Being well wa&s;hed and purified, the bather is wrap|ped up in hot linen, and follows his guide through various windings, which lead to the outward apart|ment; while this in&s;en&s;ible tran&s;ition, from heat to cold, prevents all inconvenience. Being come to the alcove, a bed is ready prepared, on which the per|&s;on no &s;ooner lies down, than a boy comes, and begins to pre&s;s with his delicate hands, all parts of the body, in order to dry them perfectly: the linen is once more changed; and the boy gently rubs the
<PB N="363" REF="374">

<P>Coming from a bath filled with hot vapour, in which exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration bedewed every limb, into a &s;pacious apartment, and the open air, the lungs ex|pand and re&s;pire plea&s;ure. Well kneaded, and, as it were, regenerated the blood circulates freely, the body feels a voluptuous ea&s;e, a flexibility till then un|known, and a lightne&s;s, as if relieved from &s;ome enormous weight; and the man almo&s;t fancies him&s;elf new-born, and fir&s;t beginning to live. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence, diffu&s;es it&s;elf to the very extremities; and, while thus yielding to the mo&s;t delightful &s;en&s;ations, ideas of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind, pervade and fill the &s;oul; the imagination wanders through worlds, which it&s;elf embelli&s;hes, every where drawing pictures of happine&s;s and delight. If life be only a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, the vigour, the rapidity, with which the me|mory then retraces all the knowledge of the man, would lead us to believe, that the two hours of deli|cious calm, which &s;ucceed bathing, are an age.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the baths, the u&s;e of which was &s;o &s;trong|ly recommended by the ancients, and the plea&s;ures of which the Egyptians &s;till enjoy. Here they prevent or exterminate rheumati&s;ms, catarrhs, and tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es

of the &s;kin, which want of per&s;piration occa|&s;ions. Here they find a radical cure for that di&s;ea&s;e, which attacks the powers of generation, and the reme|dies for which are &s;o dangerous in Europe. Here they rid them&s;elves of tho&s;e uncomfortable &s;en&s;ations, &s;o common among other nations, who have not the &s;ame regard to cleanline&s;s. <HI>Tournfort,</HI> who had taken the vapour bath at Con&s;tantinople, where they are much le&s;s careful than at Grand Cairo, thinks they injure the lungs; but longer experience would have convinced him of his error. There are no people who practi&s;e this bathing more than the Egyptians; nor any to whom &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es are le&s;s known. They are almo&s;t wholly unacquainted with pulmonic com|plaints.</P>
<P>The women are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the&s;e baths, where they go at lea&s;t once a week, taking with them &s;laves accu&s;tomed to the office. More &s;en&s;ual than men, after the u&s;ual proce&s;s, they wa&s;h the body, and particularly the head with ro&s;e-water. Then their attendants braid their long black hair, with which, in|&s;tead of powder and pomatum, they mingle precious e&s;&s;ences. They then blacken the rim of the eye-lid, arch the brows with <HI>cohel</HI> (tin burnt with gall nuts) and &s;tain the nails of their hands and feet, of a golden yellow, with <HI>henna.</HI> Their linen, and their robes having been pa&s;t through the &s;weet vapour of aloes

wood, and their dre&s;&s;ing ended, they remain in the outward apartment, and pa&s;s the day in fea&s;ting; while &s;inging girls come and dance, and &s;ing &s;oothing airs, or recount amorous adventures.</P>
<P>The days of bathing, are fe&s;tive days among the Egyptian women; they deck them&s;elves magnifi|cently; and, under the long veil of mantle, which hide them from the public eye, wear the riche&s;t &s;tuffs. They undre&s;s them&s;elves in pre&s;ence of each other, and their vanity extends to their very drawers; which, in winter, are made of &s;tuffs, inwove with &s;ilk and gold; and, in &s;ummer, of worked mu&s;lin. Ruffles and lace, are unknown to them; but their &s;hifts are made of cotton and &s;ilk, as light and tran&s;parent as gauze. Rich &s;a&s;hes of ca&s;&s;imere, bind up their floating robes. The wool of ca&s;&s;imere, is the fine&s;t in the world, &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing &s;ilk it&s;elf. The &s;a&s;hes made from it, co&s;t about five and twenty pounds each; they are u&s;ually em|broidered at the ends; and, though three French ells long, and one wide, may be drawn through a ring. Two cre&s;cents of fine pearls, &s;parkle amid the black hair that &s;hades their temples; while diamonds en|rich the Indian handkerchief, with which they bind their brows. Such are the Georgians and Circa&s;&s;ians, whom the Turks purcha&s;e for their wives. They are neat to exce&s;s, and walk in an atmo&s;phere of per|fumes;
<PB N="366" REF="377">
and, though their luxury is hidden from the public, it &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the European women.</P>
<P>That we may fini&s;h the portrait of the Egyptian ladies, we will relate from <HI>Savary,</HI> a love-adventure, which happened when he was at Ro&s;etta. Facts are better than arguments, to &s;hew the manners of a peo|ple. <HI>Ha&s;&s;an,</HI> an old jealous Turk, had married a Georgian girl of &s;ixteen, and appointed guards t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> watch her. But what guards are &s;o vigilant as love? This wealthy lord, had a magnificent garden near Ro|&s;etta, whither he permitted the youthful <HI>Jemily,</HI> his wife, to go and take the evening air. Slaves of both &s;exes always attended her. The men watched the walls, and &s;tood centinel at the gates; the women waited on her within, where &s;he languidly &s;trayed among bowers. As &s;he was gravely walking, one evening, by the river &s;ide, veiled, and &s;urrounded by her &s;laves, to go to her garden, &s;he perceived a Eu|ropean, who lately had arrived at Ro&s;etta. The co|lours of youth were vivid on his cheeks, which were not yet tanned by the &s;un, and drew her attention. She pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly, and let her fan fall, that &s;he might have a pretence to &s;top a moment. Her eyes met his, and the look went to her heart; the air, the &s;hape, the features of the &s;tranger, were imprinted in her memory; and, the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;peaking to, and the dread of &s;eeing him no more, gave her a painful
<PB N="367" REF="378">
&s;en&s;e of &s;lavery. Scarcely had &s;he arrived among the arbours of her garden, before &s;he e&s;caped from the croud; and, taking one of the women a&s;ide, in whom &s;he had mo&s;t confidence, &s;aid, Did&s;t thou perceive the young &s;tranger? Did&s;t thou behold his bright eyes, and how he looked upon me? O, my friend! My dear <HI>Zetfa!</HI> Go find him, and tell him to walk among the orange groves to morrow evening, where the wall is lowe&s;t. Say, I wi&s;h to &s;ee him, and &s;peak to him; only bid him &s;hun the watchful eyes of my pityle&s;s keepers.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age was punctually delivered, and the Eu|ropean, unguardedly promi&s;ed; which promi&s;e, the &s;ight of approaching danger made him break. The &s;lave went a &s;econd time, and a&s;ked him why he had not kept his word. His excu&s;es were various, and he fixed a di&s;tant time. Reflection again vanqui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion, and he went not to the rendezvous. <HI>Zetfa</HI> returned once more. The youth, &s;educed by her di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;wore, that on the morrow, he would be under the arbour, an hour after &s;un-&s;et. The hour of ap|pointment came, and a third time, the beauteous <HI>Je|mily,</HI> &s;aw her&s;elf deceived. <HI>Zetfa</HI> returned to the European, reproached him for his perfidy, and the imprudent youth once more promi&s;ed; but, left to him&s;elf, the dread of an ignominious death, made him again violate his words. Patience it&s;elf has a period;
<PB N="368" REF="379">
that of <HI>Jemily,</HI> was long: for nine months &s;he &s;olicited a man, whom &s;he had &s;een but an in&s;tant. One even|ing, after &s;hedding tears of bitterne&s;s, forgetting her|&s;elf in the grove, and thinking only of her lover, <HI>Ha&s;&s;an,</HI> tired of waiting, treated her har&s;hly. The charm was broken, and &s;he retired furious to her apartment. Go once more, &s;aid &s;he, to the perfidious European, and bear him the&s;e my la&s;t words&mdash;I &s;aw you, &s;tranger, I thought you had &s;en&s;ibility, and my heart panted to be yours. Nine months you have deceived me; perjury to you is &s;port. But, beware, your life is in my hands, and I am determined. <HI>Ha&s;&s;an,</HI> will go tomorrow to Faoua, and he will not return till late. Either come in the evening and receive your pardon, or a &s;lave &s;hall bring me your head. <HI>Jemily,</HI> &s;wears by the prophet, if longer neglected, to be re|venged.</P>
<P><HI>Zetfa</HI> faithfully reported the&s;e words, and the Eu|ropean he&s;itated no longer. At the appointed hour, he came to the wall, which &s;eparated him from the beauteous Georgian. His heart palpitates, he leaps the wall, and enters into the garden. Two women, on &s;eeing him, ri&s;e and appear terrified, while he &s;tood motionle&s;s. The one was <HI>Jemily</HI> her&s;elf, who held out her hand, and gave him courage. He approached, bowed profoundly, and was kindly rai&s;ed; a &s;ignal was given, and the &s;lave di&s;appeared. Stranger, &s;aid
<PB N="369" REF="380">
<HI>Jemily,</HI> why have you deceived me &s;o long, you love me not? Forgive me, beauteous <HI>Jemily;</HI> it was my fears detained me, but I am come to repair my wrongs, and throw my&s;elf at your feet. She &s;eemed as if &s;he would have continued her reproaches, but taking him by the hand, which trembled in her own, &s;he led him to an orange-grove.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Marriages, Education, and Paternal Authority.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE, among Chri&s;tians, is a holy rite, and indi&s;&s;oluble. Laws, in certain ca&s;es, &s;u&s;|pend, but &s;eldom annihilate its effects. Oriental manners, &s;o different from Europeans, have obliged legi&s;lators to render wedlock le&s;s permanent. The female relations, make matches for the young men. They meet mo&s;t of the maidens of the city at the bath, whom they perfectly de&s;cribe; and the choice made, the alliance is mentioned to the father of the
<PB N="370" REF="381">
female, the portion &s;pecified; and, if he con&s;ents, they make him pre&s;ents. The proce&s;&s;ion, which is the commencement of the marriage-ceremony, u&s;ually begins in the evening; dancers go before the bride, with their feet tied to &s;tilts, and carrying balancing poles; numerous &s;laves di&s;play the effects, furniture, and jewels, de&s;tined to her u&s;e; troops of dancing girls, keep time with their in&s;truments; matrons richly cloathed, walk with a grave pace, and the young bride appears under a magnificent canopy, borne by four &s;laves, &s;u&s;tained by her mother and &s;i&s;ters, and en|tirely covered by a veil, embroidered with gold, pearls, and diamonds. A long file of flambeaux il|lumine the proce&s;&s;ion; and the almai, in chorus, oc|ca&s;ionally &s;ing ver&s;es in prai&s;e of the bride and bride-groom. I have twenty times beheld &s;uch pompous proce&s;&s;ions, in the &s;treets of Cairo, where the longe&s;t route is always cho&s;en; they being vain of di&s;playing their whole &s;plendor on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When come to the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band, the women go on the fir&s;t floor, whence they perceive, through the blinds of a gallery, all that pa&s;&s;es below. The men, who are a&s;&s;embled in the hall, do not mix with them, but pa&s;s part of the night in banquetting, and hearing mu&s;ic. The almai de&s;cend, throw off their veils, and di&s;play their agility and addre&s;s; ex|hibiting to the &s;ound of mu&s;ic, pantomimes, in which
<PB N="371" REF="382">
they repre&s;ent the combats of Hymen, the &s;truggles of the bride, and the artifices of love. Having ended, the almai, in chorus, chaunt the epithalamium. Dur|ing the ceremony, the bride pa&s;&s;es &s;everal times before the bridegroom, and always in different dre&s;&s;es, to di&s;play her wealth and elegance. The gue&s;ts having retired, the hu&s;band enters the nuptial chamber; the veil is removed, and, for the fir&s;t time, he beholds his wife.</P>
<P>Such are the ceremonies of marriage among the Egyptians, which the rich and poor &s;crupulou&s;ly ob|&s;erve. The daughter of the mechanic, is, in like manner, conducted to her &s;pou&s;e; the only difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;urrounding paraphernalia. In&s;tead of &s;lambeaux, they burn fir, in braziers carried on poles; and the &s;tilt dancers, and tambours de ba&s;que, &s;upply the want of almai, and mu&s;icians. The poor man's daughter, wanting attendants and canopies, borrows a veil, and marches to the &s;ound of cymbals, or bits of metal, which her indigent followers &s;trike in time, without tune.</P>
<P>Nearly the &s;ame ceremonies are ob&s;erved by the Copts; but they have a cu&s;tom of betrothing young girls, only &s;ix or &s;even years old, which is done by putting a ring on the finger. They often obtain per|mi&s;&s;ion, from her friends, to educate her, till &s;he ar|rives
<PB N="372" REF="383">
at puberty. Divorces, bathing, and marriage proce&s;&s;ions, are al&s;o practi&s;ed by the &s;chi&s;matic chri&s;|tians; only they can have but one wife at a time.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of an Egyptian lady is to educate her children; and a numerous po&s;terity is their mo&s;t fervent wi&s;h. This is even the prayer of the poor, who earns his bread by the &s;weat of his brow; and did not adoption alleviate grief, when nature is un|kind, a barren woman would be incon&s;olable. The mother daily &s;uckles her child, who&s;e infant &s;miles, added to frequent pregnancy, recompences all the cares and pains they create. Milk di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e maladies which dry up the juices of the youthful wife, who &s;ends her offspring to be nurtured by a &s;tranger, are here unknown. That mothers &s;hould &s;uckle their young, is a law as ancient as the world; it is expre&s;sly ordered by <HI>Mahomet.</HI> "Let mothers &s;uckle their children full two years, if the child does not quit the brea&s;t; but &s;he &s;hall be permitted to wean it with the con&s;ent of her hu&s;band." <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> in the Ely&s;ian fields, beholds his mother, his tender mother, there, who had &s;ed him with her milk, and nurtured him in infancy.</P>
<P>When obliged by circum&s;tances to take a nur&s;e, they do not treat her as a &s;tranger; &s;he becomes one
<PB N="373" REF="384">
of the family, and pa&s;&s;es her days amid&s;t the children &s;he has &s;uckled, by whom &s;he is cheri&s;hed and ho|noured as a &s;econd mother.</P>
<P>The harem, is the cradle and &s;chool of infancy. The new-born feeble infant is not there &s;waddled, and filleted up in a &s;wathe, the &s;ource of a thou&s;and di&s;ea&s;es. Laid naked on a mat, expo&s;ed in a va&s;t chamber to the pure air, he breathes freely; and, with his delicate limbs, &s;prawls at plea&s;ure. The new element in which he is to live, is not entered with pain and tears. Daily bathed beneath his mother's eye, he grows apace; free to act, he tries his coming powers, rolls, crawls, ri&s;es; and, &s;hould he fall, can|not much hurt him&s;elf, on the carpet, or mat, which covers the floor.</P>
<P>He is not bani&s;hed his father's hou&s;e, when &s;even years old, and &s;ent to college, with the lo&s;s of health and innocence; he does not, it is true, acquire much learning; he, perhaps, can only read and write; but, he is healthy, robu&s;t, fears God, re&s;pects old age, has filial piety, and delights in ho&s;pitality; which virtues, continually practi&s;ed in his family, remain deeply en|graven in his heart.</P>
<P>The daughter's education is the &s;ame. Whalebone and bu&s;ks, which martyr European girls, they know
<PB N="374" REF="385">
not; they run naked, or covered only with a &s;hift, till &s;ix years old; and the dre&s;s they afterwards wear, confines none of their limbs, but &s;uffers the body to take its true form; and nothing is more uncommon than ricketty children, and crooked people.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory places the infancy of human nature in the Ea&s;t; here paternal authority began, and here its rights are &s;till pre&s;erved. A father enjoys all the titles nature be&s;tows. Each family forms a &s;mall &s;tate, of which the father is king; the members of it, at|tached to him by the ties of blood, acknowledge and &s;ubmit to his power. The children, educated in the women's apartment, do not come into the hall; e&s;pe|cially when &s;trangers are there. Young people are &s;ilent in this hall; if men grown, they are allowed to join the conver&s;ation: but, when the &s;heik, <HI>i. e.</HI> head of the family, &s;peaks, they cea&s;e and attentively li&s;ten; if he enters an a&s;&s;embly, all ri&s;e; they give him way in public, and every where &s;hew him e&s;teem and re&s;pect. In the time of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the&s;e manners &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Egypt; and the de&s;poti&s;m under which it groans, &s;erves to pre&s;erve them. A numerous po&s;|terity, often re&s;ides under the &s;ame roof; the children, and grand-children, come and pay their common father a daily tribute of veneration and love: the plea&s;ure of being loved and re&s;pected, in proportion as age increa&s;es, makes him forget he grows old;
<PB N="375" REF="386">
the content of his heart &s;parkles in his eyes, and &s;ecu|rity &s;mooths the wrinkles of his forehead; he is chear|ful and jocular; and, while his youthful de&s;cendants wear the mo&s;t mode&s;t garments, he is decked in the gaye&s;t colours Happy, in the bo&s;om of his family, when on the borders of the grave, he perceives not the approach of death; and reclines to everla&s;ting re&s;t, amid&s;t the embraces of his children. Long do they mourn his lo&s;s, and each week &s;trew his tomb with flowers. The Egyptians have lo&s;t the art of embalming, but not the feelings which gave it birth.</P>
<P>Among poli&s;hed nations, the &s;ilver-haired fire is often obliged to be &s;ilent, in the pre&s;ence of haughty youth; or a&s;&s;ume the manners of a boy, to become &s;upportable. In proportion, as the burthen of life is felt, and its plea&s;ures dimini&s;h, he beholds him&s;elf an incumbrance to tho&s;e who, but for him, had never been. They refu&s;e him con&s;olation when he needs it mo&s;t; and the cold hand of age withers his faculties, which the kindly flame of filial love warms not. In &s;uch nations, the grey-haired feeling father dies, long before he is carried to the grave. I was impelled, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> to draw this parallel, by the affecting &s;cenes I here each day witne&s;s; where the reverend patriarch, with his beard floating on his brea&s;t, &s;miles in frigid age on his grand-children, who approach
<PB N="376" REF="387" MS="y">
him with their care&s;&s;es. He beholds four generations, eager to pay him all filial duty; his heart expands, and he delights in life to its la&s;t moment. The&s;e people have, in ignorance, pre&s;erved the &s;implicity of an|cient manners; they know not our arts and &s;ciences, but the &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ations of nature, not taught by book, they know, enjoy, and revere.</P>
