<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE COMIC BALLAD.</HEAD>
<P>THE pieces here &s;elected under the title of Comic Ballads fall under the &s;everal denominations of Pa&s;toral, Amatory, Ludicrous, and Convivial; this Di&s;&s;ertation therefore naturally divides it&s;elf into the&s;e &s;everal heads.</P>
<P>No &s;ubject of critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion has been examined with more a&s;&s;iduity, and le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s, than Pa&s;toral compo&s;ition. The French critics, whom a writer of any di&s;cernment &s;eldom quotes but to confute their ab&s;urdities, have here blundered with more than or|dinary addre&s;s. Rapin has found that pa&s;toral writing
<PB N="x" REF="6">mu&s;t faithfully repre&s;ent the manners of the golden age. Dubos, a more judicious writer, has di&s;covered that the real dialogues of modern &s;hepherds are too gro&s;s for poetic relation; he therefore advi&s;es a poet, who would now venture into this walk of ver&s;e, to choo&s;e for his &s;peakers princes who had lo&s;t them&s;elves in a wood. He is &s;urely him&s;elf lo&s;t in a wood of fal&s;e critici&s;m, when he informs us that the fir&s;t Dialogue of Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds, is an excellent Pa&s;toral Eclogue. It is no doubt a very fine piece of writing, but, con&s;idered in the light of a Bucolic Po|em, it makes fully as aukward a figure as an ancient River God in a French Opera with a tye wig, and &s;ilk &s;tockings.</P>
<P>Did the&s;e writers ever read Theocritus? Did they not know that he was the father, and his works the only models, of this kind of poetry?</P>
<P>Of all the poets of antiquity, none has been imitated with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than that excellent writer. He would him&s;elf appear to be perfectly original; for though we read that Homer was indebted for &s;ome of his beauties to his poetical predece&s;&s;ors, we never find Theocritus lay under this accu&s;ation. His eclogues breathe the very &s;pirit of nature; and &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of all his imi|tators in beauty, as much as a romantic river, wander|ing through the riche&s;t rural &s;cenes, does a Dutch jet|d'eau
<PB N="xi" REF="7">&s;quirting among hedges of clipt yews. Virgil, who was born an elegiac poet, but never happened upon his proper province, has in pa&s;toral only di&s;played excellent &s;kill in ver&s;ification, which is indeed his fir&s;t and almo&s;t only prai&s;e in all his works. His very per&s;ons are ridiculous; for what have Thyr&s;is and Corydon to do with the Po? An ab&s;urdity followed by the whole imitators of this imitator; and among others by Pope, who gravely makes Alexis &s;ing upon the banks of the Thames. His admired French author Boileau, might have told him that Truth alone is fair and lovely. To confound the <HI>names</HI> of different climates and ages mu&s;t, to every reader of ta&s;te, appear fully as ludicrous as to confound places and dates in defiance of geography and chronology. Who but mu&s;t &s;mile if he read that Theocritus was born at the Devil tavern, in the Strand at Paris, in the year of Chri&s;t 908, and had the honour to recite one of his eclogues before that merry prince Charles I. of England, who was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he cut three capers of a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing height, to the amazement of the bard; and afterwards made him a pre&s;ent of a lottery ticket? Yet this is not more ab&s;urd than to mingle names, places, and &s;ubjects, that are perfectly heterogeneous, as is done in Pope's pa&s;torals; which are very much inferior to them of Philips, though Phillips has no
<PB N="xii" REF="8">claim to prai&s;e. The fact is, that pa&s;toral eclogue is quite foreign to modern manners. Tho&s;e of The|ocritus appear natural from their antiquity, and from his inimitable language and manner, but he &s;tands alone, and ever will.</P>
<P>Any eclogues that occur in this collection, &s;uch as <HI>Robene and Makyne,</HI> &amp;c. are of a lyric nature; and may with much more propriety be called &s;ongs than eclogues, though they partake of the manner of both. I there|fore leave the pa&s;toral eclogue to come to the pa&s;toral &s;ong or ballad, a &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, which, though not very remote in its e&s;&s;ence from the pa&s;toral dialogue, is infinitely more con&s;onant to modern man|ners, as it implies no per&s;onal repre&s;entation. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be written or &s;poken by a &s;hepherd, but merely to convey rural &s;entiments and images.</P>
<P>Dubos tells us, that the pea&s;ants of Italy at this day go to keep their flocks, or labour the ground, with their guitar on their backs; and that they &s;ing their loves in extempore ver&s;es, which they accompany with their in&s;trument. This they call <HI>Improvi&s;adare</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This practice of making extempore ver&s;es is frequent in Italy, as we may ob&s;erve in many of the late&s;t travellers. But I &s;uppo&s;e the principal merit of &s;uch poetry ari&s;es from the &s;urprize of the hearer. The works of Barnardino Per|fetti, a Patrician of Sienna, <HI>Firenze,</HI> 1774, now lie before me. He was the be&s;t of modern extemporary poets, and crowned in the capitol, yet there is nothing in them.</NOTE>, Were
<PB N="xiii" REF="9">any of the&s;e &s;ongs to be committed to writing, and of high merit, it might be con&s;idered as a pa&s;toral &s;ong complete in every circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Yet I que&s;tion if in truth of character, it could exceed &s;ome of the pieces of that kind now under our eye, though written perhaps in the &s;moke and noi&s;e of a capital. But to pa&s;s from this theory, many of the Scoti&s;h &s;ongs now &s;elected, mu&s;t be allowed by every good judge to have uncommon excellence in the pa&s;toral mode of poetry. They po&s;&s;e&s;s the utmo&s;t truth of manner and of colouring. They have all that &s;weetne&s;s which an ancient critic
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Hermogenes, l.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 23.</BIBL></NOTE> ob&s;erves, is the re&s;ult of perfect &s;implicity. As mo&s;t of the Pa&s;toral pieces in this Selection are likewi&s;e of the Amatory &s;tyle, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the&s;e kinds of poetry in conjunction.</P>
<P>If the antiquity of the different kinds of poetry were properly a&s;certained, it is to be believed that love, poetry would be found among tho&s;e of the fir&s;t inven|tion. Love, that &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, is ever the in&s;pirer of poetry. Love is a ma&s;ter that can call forth mu&s;ical &s;ounds from the heart of the &s;avage of Iceland, amid his half year's wintry night, as well as from that of the exulting inhabitant of Arabia the
<PB N="xiv" REF="10">happy under the influence of the &s;ummer &s;un. His effects are controlled by no manner of life, and con|fined by no zone. In the mo&s;t barbarous countries Love will be found the in&s;pirer of &s;entiment, and re|finer of thought and of language:
<Q><L>Spirero nobil &s;en&s;i a rozzi petti;</L>
<L>Raddolciro delle lor lingue il &s;uono.</L></Q></P>
<P>As Love is perhaps the father of poetry
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">; Plato, loq. de Amore.</NOTE>, &s;o it is ob&s;erved that the fair objects, and be&s;t judges of that pa&s;&s;ion, have always e&s;teemed it the mo&s;t complete triumph of their charms when their lovers are &s;o en|flamed as to commence poets in their prai&s;e. Amorous poetry has often been the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>magic charm</HI> that has caught the heart of the fair novice in that pa&s;&s;ion. This has not e&s;caped Shak&s;pere, that anatomi&s;t of the heart.</P>
<Q><L>My gracious Duke,</L>
<L>This man has witched the bo&s;om of my child:</L>
<L>Thou, thou, Ly&s;ander, thou ha&s;t <HI>given her rhymes;</HI></L>
<L>And &s;tolen th' impre&s;&s;ion of her fanta&s;y</L>
<L>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</L>
<L>Knacks, trifles, no&s;egays, &s;weetmeats, (me&s;&s;engers</L>
<L>Of &s;trong prevailment in unharden'd youth.)</L>
<BIBL><HI>Mid&s;ummer Nights Dream.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="11">If we except Sappho, the only female who ever wrote any thing worth pre&s;ervation; there is no writer who has painted love in more genuine and tender co|lours than are u&s;ed in the Scotch Amatory Ballads. Yet there are none of them, that I remember, are written by ladies
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is indeed of very late years, one in&s;ignificant exception to this rule. <HI>Auld Robin Gray</HI> having got his &s;illy p&s;alm &s;et to &s;oporific mu&s;ic, is to the credit of our ta&s;te, popular for the day. But after lulling &s;ome good-natured audiences a&s;leep, he will &s;oon fall a&s;leep him&s;elf.</NOTE>. That profligacy of manners which always reigns before women can &s;o utterly forget all &s;en&s;e of decency and propriety as to commence authors, is yet almo&s;t unknown in Scotland. May it ever be &s;o! May dome&s;tic duties and affections be ever the &s;ole employments and amu&s;ements of my fair country-women, while tho&s;e of other kingdoms are &s;howing them&s;elves naked in love &s;ongs and romances, or &s;talking the &s;treets in the breeches of critici&s;m and morality!</P>
<P>The love ver&s;es in this volume are of almo&s;t every different hue incident to that changeable pa&s;&s;ion; but a plaintive tenderne&s;s is the more general characteri&s;tic of them. Fielding, I think, has ob&s;erved that love is generally accompanied by a plea&s;ing melancholy. The &s;ongs in this collection called <HI>Lochaber, Ewbuchts Ma|rion, Low down in the broom,</HI> and many others have,
<PB N="xvi" REF="12">when accompanied witn their proper airs, a mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite pathos:
<Q><L>They yield a very echo to the &s;eat</L>
<L>Where Love is throned.</L></Q></P>
<P>Others again po&s;&s;e&s;s an equal power of &s;prightline&s;s; &s;uch as <HI>An thou wert my ain thing, Soger Ladie, O'er the Bogie,</HI> &amp;c. which do not yield to the be&s;t French &s;ongs in &s;pirit, though the&s;e are likewi&s;e excellent in their kind. Indeed if the French excel in any &s;pecies of poetry, it is in their &s;ongs, though their be&s;t efforts in this way do not &s;eem much known in England. As this is the ca&s;e, and it is perfectly coherent with my &s;ubject, I &s;hall beg leave to pre&s;ent my reader with a few French &s;ongs of the fir&s;t merit.</P>

<P>But to return, I mu&s;t not quit this &s;ubject without offering a few remarks on the principal &s;cene of the Scoti&s;h pa&s;toral &s;ongs, namely the &s;outhern part of Scotland in the neighbourhood of the Tweed. I can|not do this better than in the words of an excellent writer. He forms a fine contra&s;t by beginning with a de&s;cription of the Northern parts of Scotland. <Q>The highlands of Scotland, &s;ays he, are a picture&s;que, but in general a melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous de&s;ert covered with dark heath, and often ob&s;cured by mi&s;ty weather; narrow vallies, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices, re&s;ound|ing with the fall of torrents; a &s;oil &s;o rugged and a climate &s;o dreary, as in many parts to admit neither the amu&s;ements of pa&s;turage, nor the la|bours
<PB N="xxv" REF="21">of agriculture; the mournful da&s;hing of waves along the friths and lakes that inter&s;ect the country; the portentous noi&s;es which every change of the wind, and every increa&s;e and diminution of the wa|ters is apt to rai&s;e in a lonely region full of echoes, and rocks, and caverns: the grote&s;que and gha&s;tly appearance of &s;uch a land&s;cape by the light of the moon:&mdash;Objects like the&s;e diffu&s;e a gloom over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with oc|ca&s;ional and &s;ocial merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of &s;ilence and &s;olitude.</Q> And a little further he ob|&s;erves, <Q>that the ancient highlanders of Scotland had hardly any other way of &s;upporting them&s;elves than by hunting, fi&s;hing, or war; profe&s;&s;ions that are continually expo&s;ed to fatal accidents. And hence, no doubt, additional horrors would often haunt their &s;olitude, and a deeper gloom over&s;hadow the imagi|nation even of the hardie&s;t native.</Q> He proceeds,</P>
<P><Q>What then would it be rea&s;onable to expect from the fanciful tribe, from the mu&s;icians and poets, of &s;uch a region? Strains expre&s;&s;ive of joy, tranquillity, or the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions? No. Their &s;tyle mu&s;t have been better &s;uited to their circum&s;tances. And &s;o we find in fact that their mu&s;ic is. The wilde&s;t ir|regularity appears in its compo&s;ition; the expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="xxvi" REF="22">is warlike and melancholy, and approaches even to the terrible&mdash;And that their poetry is almo&s;t uni|formly mournful, and their views of nature dark and dreary, will be allowed by all who admit of the authenticity of O&s;&s;ian; and not doubted by any who believe the&s;e fragments of highland poetry to be ge|nuine, which many old people, now alive, of that country remember to have heard in their youth, and were then taught to refer to a pretty high an|tiquity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some of the Southern provinces of Scotland pre|&s;ent a very different pro&s;pect. Smooth and lofty hills covered with verdure, clear &s;treams winding through long and beautiful valleys, trees produced without culture, here &s;traggling or &s;ingle, and there crowding into little groves and bowers, with other circum&s;tances peculiar to the di&s;tricts I allude to, render them fit for pa&s;turage, and favourable to ro|mantic lei&s;ure, and tender pa&s;&s;ions. Several of the old Scotch &s;ongs take their names from the rivulets, villages and hills adjoining to the Tweed near Mel|ro&s;e, a region di&s;tingui&s;hed by many charming va|rieties of rural &s;cenery, and which, whether we con&s;ider the face of the country, or the genius of the people, may properly enough be termed the Arcadia of Scotland. And all the&s;e &s;ongs are &s;weetfully and

<P>Thus far this eminent philo&s;opher and poet; who&s;e ideas are &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o con&s;onant with my own, that they leave me little or nothing further to add. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve that the genuine Old Songs, which were originally &s;et to the mo&s;t ad|mired of the Scoti&s;h airs, are mo&s;t of them unfor|tunately lo&s;t. For the pre&s;ent words to the greater part of them we are indebted to Allan Ram&s;ay, and his friends, as he him&s;elf informs us in the fol|lowing words of the preface to his Tea-table Mi&s;cel|cellany, or Collection of Songs. <Q>My being well a&s;|&s;ured how acceptable new words to known good tunes would prove, engaged me to the making ver&s;es for above SIXTY of them in this and the &s;econd vo|lume:</Q> (which are Scoti&s;h &s;ongs, the third and la&s;t volume containing mo&s;tly Engli&s;h,) <Q>about THIRTY more were done by &s;ome ingenious young gentlemen.</Q> I heartily wi&s;h hone&s;t Allan and his ingenious young gentlemen had rather u&s;ed their endeavours to recover and pre&s;erve the real ancient ballads, than to compo&s;e new ones. For uncouth as tho&s;e might be, I much
<PB N="xxviii" REF="24">&s;u&s;pect they exceeded their &s;ub&s;titutes in variety at lea&s;t. Indeed as I meant this as a POETICAL, not as a MUSICAL work, I found my&s;elf obliged to admit only the be&s;t of the&s;e modern pieces, always prefering the ancient when it could be found. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h for words to all the Scoti&s;h airs, may find them in many collections. This only means to pre&s;ent the reader of ta&s;te with the very be&s;t of Scoti&s;h ballad poetry. The reader, whom I could wi&s;h to plea&s;e, would turn with contempt from a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame ideas expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame words and &s;tanza. For though the airs vary, their verbal accom|paniments have in general a &s;imilarity as di&s;gu&s;ting as the poems of Blackmore, or the pictures of Angelica Kauffman. Though the ancient &s;ongs were perhaps le&s;s &s;mooth than their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, they were doubtle&s;s more varied, being compo&s;ed at di&s;tant periods by different min&s;trels, than they could po&s;&s;ibly be by Allan Ram&s;ay (a writer not rich in ideas) and his young friends, who perhaps begun and fini&s;hed their labours in this way in the &s;pace of a few weeks. And if they were har&s;h or uncouth, the ancient compo&s;er might plead with Ta&s;&s;o:
<Q><L>&mdash; &s;e ben miri,</L>
<L>Molle, e dura e co&s;tei;</L>
<L><PB N="xxix" REF="25">Co&s;i &s;on duri, e molli i ver&s;i miei.</L>

<P>A very celebrated and intelligent phy&s;ician, who was born, and pa&s;&s;ed his early years in the &s;outh of Scotland, informs me, that it is his opinion, that the be&s;t of the ancient Scoti&s;h airs were really compo&s;ed by &s;hepherds. In his remembrance there was, in al|mo&s;t every village of that di&s;trict, a chief &s;hepherd, who had acquired celebrity by compo&s;ing better &s;ongs than others of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion. And he thinks that though the be&s;t airs are in general known, yet the words to at lea&s;t one half have never been publi&s;hed. The mu&s;ical in&s;truments u&s;ed by the&s;e rude min&s;trels, are the common flute, and the <HI>&s;tock-and-horn,</HI> which is a flute with a &s;mall horn fa&s;tened to the further end of it, and which forms a <HI>ba&s;e,</HI> in the nature of a ba&s;&s;oon.</P>
<P>The beginning of one of their unpubli&s;hed ballads of the mournful kind, he happens to remember. It was written on the fatal expedition to Darien, in the end of la&s;t century, a project that &s;eems to have been
<PB N="xxx" REF="26">formed for the de&s;truction of the Scoti&s;h youth, and opens with the following mo&s;t &s;triking couplet.</P>
<L>We'll a awa to the woods and murne</L>
<L>Untill our Scoti&s;h joes come hame.</L>
<P>I believe not above half a dozen of the&s;e genuine Scoti&s;h pa&s;toral ballads are in print; and &s;u&s;pect all &s;uch may be found in this volume. They have certain &s;trokes in them which, in my opinion, could only occur to real &s;hepherds. Such are <HI>The yellow-hair'd laddie, Ewbuchts Marion, In &s;immer I maw'd my meadow,</HI> &amp;c. What a &s;ad exchange to give &s;uch &s;ongs for the poor tin&s;el of Allan Ram&s;ay, and his bottle companions!</P>
<P>There is a book printed at St. Andrews in 1548, called <HI>The Complaint of Scotland.</HI> It is written by a Sir James Inglis, and is of &s;uch exceeding rarity as to be almo&s;t unique: but Dr. George Mackenzie in his Lives of Scoti&s;h Writers, has given us an ab&s;tract of it.

<P>This li&s;t, which is of exceeding curio&s;ity, may teach us that not one of our Scoti&s;h popular airs is &s;o ancient as 1548. Indeed I &s;u&s;pect the&s;e of which the &s;cene lyes in the &s;outh of Scotland, as <HI>Tweed&s;ide,</HI> &amp;c. are all of them po&s;terior to the acce&s;&s;ion of James VI. to the throne of England. Any of the above &s;ongs, that have local marks, belong to the Northern parts of Scotland; and it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the provinces which fir&s;t felt the ble&s;&s;ings of repo&s;e, would fir&s;t break out into finging. Not above two of the pieces in this li&s;t are now known. If I do not mi&s;take, numbers 2 and 19, or &s;omething like them, may be found in <HI>Smith's Songs in &s;core before the year</HI> 1500. They are Engli&s;h &s;ongs; and prove the author has intermingled Engli&s;h airs with tho&s;e of his own country. I am told No. 17 u&s;ed lately to be &s;ung on the &s;tage at Edinburgh, and contains a mock court&s;hip between a frog and a mou&s;e, of &s;ome &s;atyrical merit.</P>
<P>Some few of the modern &s;ongs have the merit of being written on real occa&s;ions, and &s;uch always &s;peak
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="29">the language of the heart, a language of difficult &s;imulation. Some of &s;uch yield not to the Elegies of Tibullus in nature and pathos, though that ancient poet is a wonderful ma&s;ter in Amatory ver&s;e. Ham|mond has never caught his &s;pirit, except in imitations, which are &s;o clo&s;e as to be almo&s;t tran&s;lations, but I have lately had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;ome Elegies of this kind in manu&s;cript, which rival tho&s;e of Tibullus him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient pieces in this &s;election are of the LUDICROUS &s;tyle of poetry, which is &s;omething &s;ur|pri&s;ing, as that &s;pecies of writing has been thought by able crities to be an effort of modern refinement. It is true the images given us in the Scoti&s;h Ludicrous pieces are often not the mo&s;t agreeable or delicate; but have the mo&s;t modern writers, Swift for example, been more laudable in this re&s;pect? In <HI>Peblis to the Play, Chri&s;t's Kirk on the Green,</HI> and others, the reader will find curious de&s;criptions of low life and manners, as they were in Scotland in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries; the more curious as they were drawn by the hands of monarchs them&s;elves. It is certainly much to the credit of the united kingdoms that, while the poets of the other countries of Europe were writing extravagant romances, Chaucer, and the princely bards of Scotland, were employed in delineating real life and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="30">In the <HI>Wyfe of Auchtermuchty,</HI> and &s;imilar productions here given, there is abundance of humour, though a critic of fa&s;hion may perhaps pronounce it <HI>low.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is NATURE, and will ever be &s;o. Had Chaucer only written, or rather tran&s;lated, the <HI>Romaunt of the Ro&s;e,</HI> his works might now have been fa&s;t a&s;leep in &s;ome old che&s;t; but his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ales,</HI> replete with humour of the lower kind, will perpetuate his fame. That father of Eng|li&s;h poetry appears to have been as much e&s;teemed in Scotland, as in his native country. Dunbar, the chief of the Scoti&s;h poets, has in his <HI>Goldin Terge</HI> the following &s;pirited apo&s;trophe in his prai&s;e, which is highly generous, if we con&s;ider the inveterate enmity at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two kingdoms. It proves that the pur&s;uit of poetry is productive of large and liberal &s;entiments, even in a barbarous period.</P>

<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="31">Chaucer may indeed be regarded as the father, not only of Engli&s;h poetry, but of that remarkable quality of writing called <HI>humour;</HI> a word which, I believe, has no corre&s;ponding term in any language, as we have none for the French <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</HI> for they are di&s;tinct ideas. <HI>Na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</HI> if I m&iuml;&s;take not, only implies a <HI>na|tive gaiety, an uncon&s;cious &s;implicity,</HI> and is never u&s;ed in a &s;ynonymous &s;en&s;e with <HI>humour,</HI> which implies &s;omething characteri&s;tic, even though <HI>&s;evere</HI> or <HI>moro&s;e,</HI> as we &s;ay a <HI>humourous gravity.</HI> Fontaine has <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</HI> Chaucer has hu|mour. Wit is an a&s;&s;imulation of di&s;tant ideas: Humour is confined to <HI>manner</HI> either of &s;peaking or writing.</P>
<P>It has been affirmed by &s;ome eminent critics, that the moderns much excel the ancients in witty and hu|mourous compo&s;ition; and alledged, that the ancients have no writers in the&s;e kinds to oppo&s;e to Don Quixote, Hudibras, The Splendid Shilling, the Adventures of Gil Blas, The Tale of a Tub, and the Rehear&s;al
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adventurer, No. 133. The reader will &s;mile at the works here enumerated, when he thinks on the omi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e of Shak&s;pere, Fielding, and Smollet; the la&s;t of whom was a writer of the mo&s;t genuine humour that ever exi&s;ted.</NOTE>. But in this they did not reflect that they only &s;aw one &s;ide of the que&s;tion. The fact is, that with is the mo&s;t fleeting and tran&s;itory quality writing can have. Like an exqui&s;ite e&s;&s;ence, it wa&s;tes it&s;elf, and leaves
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="32">only the va&s;e that contained it. The Margites of Homer I &s;u&s;pect began, like Hudibras in our time, to cea&s;e being under&s;tood before it was allowed to peri&s;h. But the argument I would u&s;e is, in &s;hort, that we cannot judge of the efforts of the ancients in this way, becau&s;e their be&s;t works are lo&s;t. Surely then to pro|nounce again&s;t them, when they cannot be heard in their defence, is not candid. It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that the modern Novel, de&s;criptive of real life, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful kind of writing known, when properly conducted, appears to have been fo|reign to ancient conception. But it appears to me very evident that the human mind, in the progre&s;s of ages, alters its &s;hape and powers, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf. In the days of Greece and Rome, its criterion would &s;eem to have been &s;trength: in modern times, ver|&s;atility aud acutene&s;s. Hence the dignity and grandeur of their writings; and the wit and preci&s;ion of ours. Rea&s;ons might be given for the difference, but this is not the proper place.</P>
<P>As we have &s;een Chaucer was &s;o much regarded by the ancient Scoti&s;h poets, I &s;uppo&s;e it was from him they took their ideas of burle&s;que de&s;criptions of vulgar life.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvii" REF="33">The CONVIVIAL &s;ongs in this Selection are not many, I &s;hall not therefore in&s;i&s;t on this head. It may, however, be ob&s;erved that, con&s;idering how much the French have written in this way, it is &s;omething &s;trange their ancient allies, the Scots, &s;hould have been &s;o barren in this very ea&s;y mode of compo&s;ition. One would imagine the juice of the grape, that in&s;pired Anacreon, was equally potent in his numerous French imitators; while the Scots, having little of that liquid in&s;piration, were by ale confined in the bands of &s;leep at the &s;ocial hour that gave the French <HI>bons vivants</HI> free acce&s;s to the regions of fancy.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected that, before clo&s;ing this e&s;&s;ay, I &s;hould offer &s;ome remarks on Scoti&s;h Mu&s;ic, a &s;ubject of much intere&s;t and curio&s;ity to every lover of that be&s;t &s;ort of melody which &s;peaks to the heart and pa&s;&s;ions. But the ingenious author of an e&s;&s;ay on Scoti&s;h Mu&s;ic, annexed to Mr. Arnot's Hi&s;tory of Edinburgh, has left me nothing to add on that head. Dr. Beattie has likewi&s;e treated this &s;ubject more briefly, but with his u&s;ual elegance and ability, in his E&s;&s;ay on Poetry and Mu&s;ic as they affect the Mind. Another good writer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gregory in his Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man with tho&s;e of the Animal World.</NOTE> has likewi&s;e dropt a few re|marks on this matter. Both the&s;e eminent authors

Not to mention <HI>Lord Thomas and fair Annet</HI> which is an Engli&s;h Ballad; as well as <HI>Chevy Chace,</HI> though &s;ome who have not &s;een Dr. Percy's ancient
<PB N="xxxix" REF="35">ballad of this name, will &s;till contend for its being Scoti&s;h
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such has been the generous impartiality of the min&s;trel who compo&s;ed this fine ballad, and who perhaps had been entertained with equal attention at Alnwick and at Dougla&s;s ca&s;tles, that hardly one intrin&s;ic mark could be given to authori&s;e the a&s;cribing of it to a native of either country, till the ancient copy appeared, which at once terminated the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>An edition printed at Aberdeen 1754, has a preface and notes, which pre&s;ent the arguments that were then valid for <HI>Chevy chace</HI> being a Scoti&s;h compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Chevy chace might be compen&s;ated to Scot|land by the recovery of many tragic pieces of no inferior merit, were means u&s;ed by tho&s;e who have opportunities for that purpo&s;e. <HI>Bertram the archer,</HI> the Robin Hood of Scotland, is now hardly known to have exi&s;ted, though he was celebrated in many a heroic ditty. The only &s;tanza known to the Editor is given, as it clo&s;es with a pretty thought. Bertram, being &s;urrounded by his enemies, ad|dre&s;&s;es his weapons in this manner:
<Q><L>My tru&s;ty bow of the tough yew,</L>
<L>That I in London bought;</L>
<L>And &s;ilken &s;trings, if ye prove true,</L>
<L>That my true love has wrought.</L></Q></P></NOTE>. Of the Scoti&s;h Ballads, which fall under the title of this &s;econd volume, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, perhaps, twenty or thirty more would have been admitted, had the limits of the work allowed it. Yet here, I have, to u&s;e a vulgar metaphor, pre&s;ented the reader with the cream of about a dozen volumes, mo&s;t of them un|common in this part of the kingdom. The comic
<PB N="xl" REF="36">pieces here given, are cho&s;en either from their being rare, their being unpubli&s;hed, or their intrin&s;ic merit.</P>
<P>For the very curious piece, which is placed at the head of this volume, and now fir&s;t publi&s;hed, I am in|debted to the friend&s;hip of the mo&s;t learned and in|genious Editor of the Reliques of Ancient Engli&s;h Poetry. <HI>Peblis to the Play</HI> will certainly be looked upon as a very con&s;iderable acqui&s;ition to ancient Scoti&s;h Poetry, and will, I doubt not, gain Dr. Percy, to whom alone the reader is beholden for it, much grate|ful applau&s;e in the Northern part of the kingdom in particular. Indeed con&s;iderable fame is already due to him who fir&s;t &s;et the example of a legitimate collec|tion of this kind, than which, if conducted with ta&s;te, nothing can well be more entertaining to the lover of Poetry. The Reliques of Ancient Engli&s;h Poetry were only the amu&s;ement of his youthful hours of relaxa|tion from &s;everer &s;tudies; but might well be called a work of infinite labour and di&s;qui&s;ition, if executed by a writer of le&s;s genius to form a noble plan, and le&s;s ability to put it in execution. For the politene&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, with which the communication of this poem was made, I now beg leave to offer him my public acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="37">Some readers may perhaps think, that a few of the pieces in this volume might, with equal propriety, have been allotted to the fir&s;t, as being of a plaintive or mournful kind. In excu&s;e it may be alledged, that the melancholy of the&s;e productions is not of the deepe&s;t &s;hade, but &s;uch as may, with no blame, fall in with the pre&s;ent arrangement; in the &s;ame manner as the be&s;t comic writings are inter&s;per&s;ed with a few &s;cenes of fugitive gravity.</P>

<HEAD>PEBLIS TO THE PLAY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR this very curious &s;pecimen of ancient Scoti&s;h poetry, the reader has already been informed that the editor was indebted to Dr. Percy; who to the copy in his hand-writing, from which this is printed, annexed the following account of the original MS.</P>
<P><Q>This old &s;ong is pre&s;erved in the Pepy&s;ian Library, at Magdalen College in Cambridge, in p. 155, of an ancient MS. collection of old Scoti&s;h &s;ongs and poems in folio; which MS. had, I believe, been a pre&s;ent to the founder of that library, (old Mr. Pepys) from the duke of Lauderdale, mini&s;ter to king Charles II. It had originally belonged to that duke's
<PB N="162" REF="199">ance&s;tor, Sir Richard Maitland, knt. who lived in the reign of queen Mary, and her &s;on king James VI; and contains a great number of &s;ongs and poems by the &s;aid Sir Richard Maitland, which are of high poetical merit, and throw moreover great light on the incidents and manners of that age. It is remarkable that this old bard, Sir Richard Maitland, was blind (like Homer and Milton), at lea&s;t at the time when &s;ome of his poems were written; as he expre&s;sly mentions it, and con&s;oles him&s;elf very poetically under the lo&s;s of his &s;ight, and very advanced age, in one of his pieces intitled, <HI>The blind Baron's Comfort.</HI> Be&s;ides his own pieces, the MS. contains a &s;election of the pieces of other bards collected by him: &s;ome of them (as this of James I.) no where el&s;e pre|&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The foregoing poem is expre&s;sly quoted for king James I's compo&s;ition, and po&s;tiively a&s;cribed to that monarch, in John Major's Scoti&s;h Hi&s;tory, 4to. See his account of king James I. towards the end, where Major &s;eems to hint that a parody had been made of this &s;ong of the king's, to ridi|cule him for &s;ome low intrigue in which the king had been detected, &amp;c. I have not the book by me, but with this clue the meaning of that very ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age, I think, may be decyphered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="200"><Q>This &s;ong written by king James I. is a proof that <HI>Chri&s;t's Kirk on the Green,</HI> was written by his de|&s;cendant James V. being evidently a more modern compo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of Major, mentioned above, is as fol|lows. <Q>Artificlo&s;um libellum de Regina dum captivus erat compo&s;uit, antequam eam in conjugem duceret: et aliam artificio&s;am cantilenam eju&s;dem, <HI>Yas &s;en,</HI> &amp;c. et jucundum artificio&s;umque illum cantum, <HI>At Bel|tayn,</HI> &amp;c. quam alij de Dalkeith et Gargeil mutare &s;tuduerunt, quia in arce aut camera clau&s;us &s;erva|batur, in qua mulier cum matre habitabat.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. P. after writing his own remarks, having communicated this poem to &s;everal of his learned friends, they inter&s;per&s;ed theirs; and I &s;hall here give their ob&s;ervations, and a few of my own, upon this &s;ingular production, after a few preliminary notices that may be nece&s;&s;ary to the Engli&s;h reader.</P>
<P>James I, king of Scotland, and the undoubted au|thor of the production now under view, was born in the year 1393, being the &s;on of Robert III.

<HEAD>II. CHRISTS KIRK ON THE GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS edition is given from the la&s;t, intitled, <HI>Two ancient Scotti&s;h poems; The Gaberlunzie Man, and Chri&s;ts Kirk on the Green; with Notes and Ob&s;ervations by John Calendar, E&s;q. of Craigforth, Edinburgh,</HI> 1782, 8vo. Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on's edition of this ballad, printed at Oxford 1691, from Bannatyne's MS. is the earlie&s;t edition. I am &s;orry, however, to &s;ee Mr. Calendar quoting Ram&s;ay's edition for &s;ome parts of his text, as there certainly never was a more ignorant or ra&s;h tran&s;criber of an|cient Scoti&s;h poetry than Allan Ram&s;ay. He &s;eems to have con&s;idered it as very much his property; and to have exerci&s;ed his own profe&s;&s;ion upon it by &s;having, curling, and powdering it at his will and plea&s;ure. Mr. Calendar might have given us a tran&s;cript of this piece from Bannatyne's MS. in the Advocate's library at Edinburgh; in which Dr. Percy has ob&s;erved in a MS. note, <HI>Chri&s;ts Kirk on the Green</HI> is very different from what it was when filled with the innovations of Allan Ram&s;ay. This mo&s;t ingenious and faithful of all editors of ancient Engli&s;h poetry has likewi&s;e the fol|lowing notice prefixed to his MS. copy of <HI>Peblis to the
<PB N="174" REF="211">Play.</HI> <Q>In Maitland's MS. the old &s;ong of <HI>Chri&s;ts Kirk</HI> differs from all the copies I have &s;een in the con|clu&s;ion of all the &s;tanzas; each of which ends with this line, by way of burden or chorus,
<L>At Chri&s;tis Kirk on the greene.</L>
always preceded by &s;ome &s;hort line, as in this fir&s;t &s;tanza;
<L>Was never in Scotland hard nor &s;ene</L>

<L>In hir new kirtil of gray,</L>
<L>full gay</L>
<L>At Chry&s;tis kirk on the grene.</L> which I cannot help thinking is more genuine than that in the Evergreen, and the other editions, as it &s;o exactly re&s;embles the conclu&s;ions of the &s;tanzas in <HI>Peblis to the Play.</HI></Q> In con&s;equence of the&s;e well founded remarks, I have pre&s;erved the burthen in this edition throughout.</P>
<P>As the foregoing piece was undoubtedly written by James I. of Scotland, &s;o we have good authority, thongh not &s;o infallible, to a&s;cribe this to James V. a
<PB N="175" REF="212">prince who delighted in low manners and adventures &s;o much, as often to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf in order to enjoy them. He reigned from 1514 to 1542. A mo&s;t cu|rious account of his death may be found in <HI>Knox's Hi&s;|tory of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland.</HI> He was the <HI>Zerbino</HI> of Ario&s;to; and is celebrated by Ron&s;ard in as good ver&s;es as ever came from his pen.</P>
<P>The notes of Mr. Calendar are fraught with that knowledge of Northern literature for which he is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated; and, though my opinion can add nothing to the general &s;uffrage, I cannot help &s;aying that, for univer&s;al &s;cience of Northern Antiquities and languages, Mr. Calendar may ju&s;tly be regarded as the mo&s;t learned man in Europe. I am &s;orry to &s;ee he takes no notice of a work he publi&s;hed a &s;pecimen of &s;ome time ago in his pre&s;ent publication; which leads me to fear he has dropt that grand de&s;ign. This was his <HI>Bibliotheca Septentrionalis</HI> in the manner of D'Her|belot's Bibliotheque Orientale, containing a complete &s;y&s;tem of Northern &s;cience of every kind to be com|prized in two folio volumes. An amazing work! and which ought to be made a national concern. In his pre&s;ent volume he promi&s;es a Glo&s;&s;ary of the ancient Scoti&s;h language; but would he return to the large de&s;ign above prai&s;ed, the fame would be infinitely greater, without much greater labour. Words are for
<PB N="176" REF="213">pedants, but facts are for all. There is, perhaps, no branch of learning more painful, and le&s;s glorious, than etymology. To Mr. Calendar the glo&s;&s;ary to this vo|lume is much obliged. They who would &s;ee what va&s;t intelligence may be be&s;towed in elucidating <HI>Chri&s;ts Kirk on the green,</HI> and the following piece called <HI>The Gaber|lunyie man,</HI> are referred to his work.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remind the reader of a curious circum&s;tance, which is, that Sappho, the celebrated poete&s;s, wrote a ballad (if I may &s;o call it) on a <HI>Country Wedding,</HI> which is mentioned by Demetrius Phalereus; and which, I doubt not, re&s;embled this. He ob&s;erves, &s;he made the Ru&s;tic Bridegroom and the Porter &s;peak in mean and vulgar language, though &s;he was her&s;elf happy in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion, where it was to be u&s;ed with propriety.

<P>St. 6. <HI>Saya Fere.</HI>] Fere, for <HI>mate,</HI> is a common word in ancient Scoti&s;h. The Scoti&s;h writers even carried it into England with them, as we may ob&s;erve in <HI>the Tra|gedies of William Alexander of Men&s;trie, London,</HI> 1607.</P>
<P>St. 13.] It is with regret I ob&s;erve, that the latter part of this &s;tanza is &s;till applicable. Many Scoti&s;h
<PB N="180" REF="217">peers have not &s;ufficient &s;pirit to &s;light Engli&s;h gold, but ignobly to this hour, barter the liberties of their country, and their own independence for it. May ex|ecration pur&s;ue their memories! Scotland is, perhaps, at this day, the only country in Europe to which the philo&s;ophical light of liberty has not penetrated. To oppo&s;e a fooli&s;h or corrupt mini&s;ter is, with my coun|trymen, to oppo&s;e legal power. One of their mo&s;t cele|brated writers is ju&s;t now engaged, at a rated &s;alary, to defend the cau&s;e of corruption.&mdash;Not all his talents will &s;ave him from the contempt of more enlightened po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>St. 19.] This ludicrous de&s;cription of the drunken gods is perfectly ri&s;ible. Nothing in <HI>Midas</HI> or <HI>The Golden Pippin</HI> can exceed it. The &s;everal attributes are finely pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>St. 25.] <HI>Bruce</HI> is here u&s;ed for him the Jacobites e&s;teem legal heir of the crown. The principles of this poem are utterly dete&s;ted by the Editor, as they are by every friend of mankind: he only gives it as a piece of fine writing in its way. The unhappy attachment to the family of Stuart, has wa&s;ted the fine&s;t e&s;tates, and &s;hed &s;ome of the be&s;t blood in Scotland. It now exi&s;ts only in the brea&s;ts of old women.</P>
<P>The real Bruce (Robert I.) was a hero, if ever any &s;uch exi&s;ted. The fine&s;t epic poem in the world might

<P>Lord Hales ob&s;erves on this &s;ingular piece, that <Q>&s;ome traces of theatrical compo&s;ition may be di&s;|covered in Scotland during the 16th century. Sir David Lind&s;ay wrote &s;everal interludes.</Q></P>
<P>By the way, Sir David Lind&s;ay was once a mo&s;t po|pular author in Scotland, witne&s;s the proverb, <HI>Its no in Davie Lind&s;ay;</HI> meaning any thing out of the common road. He was in great celebrity in his own life time, about the period of the reformation. A &s;tory is told of an hone&s;t farmer, who being on his death-bed, a pious neighbour brought an Engli&s;h bible to read to him. The dying man had to that day never known of &s;uch a book, and, upon hearing &s;ome of its mi|raculous contents, cried out, <HI>Hoot awa! Bring me Davie Lind&s;ay. That's all a made &s;tory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="222">St. 4, <HI>Fyn Mackowl.</HI>] 'Better known in England, &s;ays Lord Hales, <Q>under the moderni&s;ed name of Fingal.&mdash;Concerning this per&s;onage, whether real or imaginary, there are innumerable legends in the highlands of Scotland. He is more celebrated as a giant, then as the hero of O&s;&s;ian.</Q></P>
<P>On the next line, 'That dang the devill, &amp;c.' his lord&s;hip ob&s;erves, <Q>This may allude to the conte&s;t with the &s;pirit of Loda. Here let me ob&s;erve, that to doubt Fingal and Temora being ancient compo&s;itions, is indeed, a refinement in &s;ceptici&s;m. They contain various allu&s;ions to the manners of other times, which have e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of Mr. Macpher|&s;on him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>The Editor has been called a zealous defender of the antiquity of O&s;&s;ian by tho&s;e who had not under&s;tanding enough to perceive the &s;cope of his di&s;&s;ertation on the Oral Tradition of Poetry; which only attempts to prove that poetry may be a long time pre&s;erved by tradition; without the &s;lighte&s;t reference to O&s;&s;ian's antiquity, but from probability only of pre&s;ervation; which the candid reader will confe&s;s to be no argu|ment. The&s;e people will &s;tare when he a&s;&s;ures them that, &s;o far from being an advocate of O&s;&s;ian's an|tiquity, he does not regard twenty pages in the whole work as ancient, and has always expre&s;&s;ed that notion.
<PB N="186" REF="223">Nay be mu&s;t add that, if not two lines in the poems of O&s;&s;ian are ancient, that circum&s;tance would, if in|fallibly proved, give an infinite addition in his opinion, to their &s;uperlative merit. So little has he of the &s;pirit of an antiquary.</P>
