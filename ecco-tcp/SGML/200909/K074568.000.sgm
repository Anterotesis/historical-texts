<P>TO a generous public little apology will be nece&s;&s;ary for offering to their patronage the Story of an Indi|vidual, who, under circum&s;tances the mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ing in their nature, has been, for a con&s;iderable part of a long life, their a&s;&s;iduous and u&s;eful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The Blind, in all ages and countries, have engaged, in a peculiar degree, the &s;ympathy of mankind;&mdash;and, where original poverty has been annexed to their misfortune, it has been e&s;teemed the utmo&s;t exertion in their favour, to enable them to mini&s;ter to the amu&s;e|ment of &s;ociety, as the only means for keeping them independent of it: To this general rule, however, a &s;urpri&s;ing exception is here &s;hewn; and it is for|tunate for the credibility of this little piece, that it is given to the world du|ring the life-time not only of its HERO,
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
but of many others who were witne&s;|&s;es of the various extraordinary <HI>facts</HI> it contains.</P>
<P>It is fit, however, to notice the di&s;advantages under which it now makes it appearance;&mdash;and which, from circum&s;tances, were unavoid|able: The per&s;on who&s;e ta&s;k it was to render it, in &s;ome degree, fit for the pre&s;s, had much difficulty to en|counter in arranging the dates, &s;carce any attention having been paid to chronological order; and the various anecdotes having been &s;et down, as the recollection of them aro&s;e in the mind of the narrator, by an amanuen|&s;is wholly unqualified for the purpo&s;e, and given in a language intelligible to tho&s;e only who are well acquainted with the York&s;hire dialect.&mdash;To tho&s;e inaccuracies was added, a literal <HI>di&s;|re&s;pect of per&s;ons;</HI> the fir&s;t and third being indi&s;criminately u&s;ed through|out. To avoid con&s;tantly-recurring
<PB N="v" REF="5">
egoti&s;ms, the preference is here given to the third per&s;on; though it is feared even that will be found too often in the proper name, where it might have been, in many in&s;tances, &s;upplied by the pronoun.&mdash;But a long ab&s;ence having nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended the at|tention of the Editor, and the de&s;ire for publication before the clo&s;e of the Harrogate &s;ea&s;on being urgent, he is not allowed time to correct his own errors. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the part containing an account of the &s;hare which Metcalf bore under the late Colonel Thornton, in his expedition again&s;t the rebels; his various under|takings as a road-maker, &amp;c. have received little other correction than what could be given by interlineation. Throughout, however, not the lea&s;t violence is done to the facts; to in&s;ure the purity of which, the M.

<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">Though it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to bring the &s;tyle into &s;omething like grammatical order, and to purge it of barbari&s;ms, yet pains have been taken to pre&s;erve its &s;implicity; and in &s;ome in&s;tances, where a few &s;entences of dialogue are introduced, the original words remain. Imperfect as it is, a hope is neverthele&s;s entertained that it will prove amu&s;ing; and happy &s;hall the Author of its Apology be, if the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale &s;hall prove of &s;ufficient value to &s;mooth the decline of a life, which, though marked by eccentricity, has not been &s;pent in vain.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF JOHN METCALF.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN METCALF was born at Knare&s;|borough, on the 15th of Augu&s;t, 1717. When four years old, he was put to &s;chool by his parents, who were working people, and continued at &s;chool two years: He was then &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, which ren|dered him totally blind, though all po&s;&s;ible means were u&s;ed to pre&s;erve his &s;ight.</P>
<P>About &s;ix months after recovering from the &s;mall-pox, he was able to go from his father's hou&s;e to the end of the &s;treet, and return, without a guide; which gave him
<PB N="2" REF="8">
much &s;pirit and &s;atisfaction.&mdash;In the &s;pace of three years he was able to find his way to any part of the town of Knare&s;borough; and had begun to a&s;&s;ociate with boys of his own age, going with them to &s;eek birds' ne&s;ts, and for his &s;hare of the eggs and young birds he was to climb the trees, whil&s;t his com|rades waited at the bottom, to direct him to the ne&s;ts, and to receive what he &s;hould throw down; and from this he was &s;oon able to climb any tree he was able to gra&s;p. He would now ramble into the lanes and fields alone, to the di&s;tance of two or three miles, and return. His father keeping hor&s;es, he learned to ride, and in time became an able hor&s;eman, a gallop being his favourite pace. His parents having other children, at the age of thirteen had John taught mu&s;ic, at which he proved very expert; though he had con|ceived more ta&s;te for the cry of a hound or a harrier, than the &s;ound of any in&s;trument.</P>
<P>A gentleman at Knare&s;borough, of the name of Woodburn, was ma&s;ter of a pack of hounds:&mdash;This gentleman encouraged
<PB N="3" REF="9">
Metcalf very much, by taking him to hunt with him, and was always very de&s;irous of his company. Metcalf kept a couple of very good hounds of his own.</P>
<P>Mr. Woodburn's hounds being &s;eldom kennelled, Metcalf u&s;ed to take &s;everal of them out &s;ecretly along with his own, about ten or eleven o'clock at night, (the hares being then feeding); but one of the young hounds happening to worry a couple of lambs, it cau&s;ed him to di&s;continue that practice.</P>
<P>When about fourteen years old, his acti|vity of limbs, and the good &s;ucce&s;s with which his exploits were u&s;ually attended, con&s;oled him &s;o greatly for the deprivation of &s;ight, that he was lead to imagine it was in his power to undertake any thing, without danger: the following adventure, however, cau&s;ed him to alter his opinion of its value.</P>
<P>There happened to be a plumb-tree a little way from Knare&s;borough, where there had been a hou&s;e formerly.&mdash;One Sunday, Met|calf and his companions (who were &s;killed in
<PB N="4" REF="10">
matters of this &s;ort) would go there, to get &s;ome of the fruit; in the&s;e ca&s;es, Metcalf was always appointed to a&s;cend, for the pur|po&s;e of &s;haking the trees. He was accord|ingly &s;ent up to his po&s;t; but in the height of the bu&s;ine&s;s, his companions gathering below were &s;uddenly alarmed by the appear|ance of the owner of the tree, and prepared to quit the ground with all expedition:&mdash;Metcalf thus left to him&s;elf, &s;oon under&s;tood how matters were going, though the wind was high, which prevented him from hearing di&s;tinctly; and being inclined to follow his comrades, in making his retreat he fell head|long into a gravel-pit belonging to Sir Harry Sling&s;by, and cut a large ga&s;h in his face, without, however, receiving any other injury than a &s;tun which for &s;ome time hindered his breathing, and kept him motionle&s;s on the ground.&mdash;His father being rather &s;evere, Metcalf was afraid to go home, le&s;t his wound &s;hould lead to a di&s;covery of the prank he had been engaged in.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">Soon after this, (though not ea&s;ily di&s;|mayed) he and &s;ome other boys were com|pletely alarmed:&mdash;The church-porch at Knare&s;borough being the u&s;ual place of their meeting, they one night between eleven and twelve o'clock a&s;&s;embled there; Metcalf being generally the chief projector of their plans: They determined to rob an orchard; which having done, they returned to the church-porch to divide their booty. Before their return, a circum&s;tance had happened to which they were &s;trangers, but to the di&s;covery of which the following little inci|dent led, though not immediately: There being a large ring to the church-door, which turned for the purpo&s;e of lifting the latch, one of the party took hold of it, and, by way of bravado, gave a loud rap; calling out, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>A tankard of ale here!</HI>"</Q> A voice from within an&s;wered, very loudly, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You are at the wrong hou&s;e.</HI>"</Q> This &s;o &s;tupified the whole covey, that none of them could move for &s;ome time. At length, Metcalf &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Did you not hear &s;omething &s;peak in the
<PB N="6" REF="12">
church?"</Q> Upon this, they all took to their heels, and ran till they got out of the church|yard, Metcalf running as fa&s;t as any of them. They now held a con&s;ultation on the &s;ubject of their fright, all equally wondering at the voice, and none able to account &s;atisfactorily for it&mdash;One &s;uppo&s;ed that it might have been &s;ome brother wag, who had put his mouth to the key-hole of the North door; but to this it was objected, that the reply was too di&s;tinct and too ready to have come in that way. At length, however, their &s;pirits being a little rai&s;ed, they ventured again down the flagged pavement into the church-yard; but when they came oppo&s;ite to the church, they perceived a light, &s;o great as inclined them to believe that the church was on fire. They now re-entered the church-porch, and were nearly determined to call the par&s;on; when &s;omebody within lifting the latch and making a great noi&s;e, they again di&s;per&s;ed, terrified and &s;peechle&s;s. One of the party, (who&s;e name was Clemi&s;haw) a &s;on of the &s;exton, ran home, and in a de&s;perate fright got into
<PB N="7" REF="13">
bed with his mother; all the re&s;t, at the &s;ame time, making the be&s;t of their way.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this panic was as follows:&mdash;An old lady, wife of Dr. Talbot, (who had for many years enjoyed the living of Spof|forth) dying, and her relations, who lived at a great di&s;tance, being de&s;irous to arrive before her interment, ordered the body to be kept; this being too long the ca&s;e, and the neighbours perceiving a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, a reque&s;t was &s;ent to the Rev. Mr. Collins, who ordered the &s;exton to be called up to dig the grave in the church imme|diately: the &s;exton had lighted a great number of candles: &s;o much for the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of the church being on fire; and the grave-digger was the per&s;on who&s;e voice had &s;o terrified the apple-merchants, when they knocked. Such, however, was the impre&s;&s;ion, that pranks of this nature were not repeated.</P>
<P>About the year 1731, Metcalf being then fourteen years of age, a number of men and boys made a practice of &s;wimming in
<PB N="8" REF="14">
the river Nidd, where there are many deeps convenient for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Metcalf re|&s;olving to learn that art, joined the party, and became &s;o very expert, that his compa|nions did not chu&s;e to come near him in the water, it being his cu&s;tom to &s;eize them, &s;end them to the bottom, and &s;wim over them by way of diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>About this time, a &s;oldier and another man were drowned in the above deeps: the former, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was taken with the cramp; the latter could not &s;wim. Metcalf was &s;ent for to get up the bodies, and at the fourth time of diving &s;ucceeded in bringing up that of the &s;oldier, which, when rai&s;ed to the &s;urface, other &s;wimmers carried on &s;hore; but life had quite left it. The other body could not then be found.</P>
<P>There are very frequent floods in the river Nidd; and it is a remarkable fact, that in the deep places, there are eddies, or &s;ome other cau&s;es of attraction, which will draw to the bottom any &s;ub&s;tance, however light, which comes within their &s;phere of action. Large
<PB N="9" REF="15">
pieces of timber were often &s;een to be car|ried down by the floods; the&s;e, on coming over the deep places, were &s;topped for the &s;pace of a moment, and then &s;unk. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, Metcalf would go down and with the greate&s;t ea&s;e fix ropes to the wood, which was drawn up by &s;ome per&s;ons pur|po&s;ely &s;tationed on the banks.</P>
<P>In the year 1732, one John Barker kept an inn at the We&s;t end of the High Bridge, Knare&s;borough. This man was a manufac|turer of linen cloth, and u&s;ed to bleach his own yarn. At one time, having brought two packs of yarn to the river to wa&s;h, he thought he ob&s;erved a number of wool-packs rolling towards him; but on a nearer view it proved to be a &s;welling of the current, oc|ca&s;ioned by a &s;udden and very violent rain in the neighbourhood. He had not time to remove his yarn, &s;o that it was &s;wept away, and carried through the arches of the bridge, which &s;tands on a rock. A little below there is a piece of &s;till water, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about twenty-one feet in depth: as &s;oon as the
<PB N="10" REF="16">
yarn got to this, it &s;unk, except a little which caught the &s;kirts of the rock in going down. Metcalf being intimate with Barker, and cal|ling at his hou&s;e a few days after the acci|dent, found him lamenting his lo&s;s. Metcalf told him that he hoped to recover his yarn for him, but Barker &s;miled at the &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;urdity of the propo&s;al: finding, however, that his friend was re&s;olved on a trial, he con&s;ented. Metcalf then ordered &s;ome long cart-ropes to be procured, and fixing a hook at one end, and leaving the other to be held by &s;ome per&s;ons on the High Bridge, he de&s;cended, and hooking as much of the yarn as he could at one time, he gave orders for drawing up. In this way the whole was re|covered, with very little damage.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Metcalf happened to be at Scriven, at the hou&s;e of one Green, an innkeeper.&mdash;Two per&s;ons then pre&s;ent had a di&s;pute concerning &s;ome &s;heep which one of them had put into the penfold. The owner of the &s;heep, (one Robert Scaif, a Knare&s;|borough man, and a friend of Metcalf's)
<PB N="11" REF="17">
appeared to be ill treated by the other party, who wi&s;hed to take an unfair advantage. Metcalf perceiving that they were not likely to agree about the damages, bade them good night, &s;aying he was going to Knare&s;borough, but it being about the dead time of night, he was firmly re&s;olved to do a little friendly bu|&s;ine&s;s before he &s;hould get home. The pen|fold being walled round, he climbed over, and getting hold of the &s;heep one by one, he fairly to&s;&s;ed them over the wall: the difficulty of the &s;ervice increa&s;ed as the number got le&s;s, not being &s;o ready to catch;&mdash;he was not, however, thereby deterred, but fully completed the exploit.</P>
<P>On the return of day, the penfold door being found fa&s;t locked, great was the &s;ur|pri&s;e on finding it untenanted, and various the conjectures as to the rogue or rogues who had liberated the &s;heep; but Metcalf pa&s;t un&s;u&s;pected, and enjoyed the joke in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>He continued to practice on the violin, until he became able to play country dances.
<PB N="12" REF="18">
At Knare&s;borough, during the winter &s;ea&s;on, there was an a&s;&s;embly every fortnight, at which he always attended, and went be&s;ides to many other places where there was public dancing; yet, though much employed in this way, he &s;till retained his fondne&s;s for hunt|ing, and likewi&s;e began to keep game cocks. Whenever he went to a cock-pit, it was his cu&s;tom to place him&s;elf on the lowe&s;t &s;eat, and always clo&s;e to &s;ome friend who was a good judge, and who, by certain motions, enabled him to bet, hedge, &amp;c. If at any time he heard of a better game cock than his own, he was &s;ure to get him by &s;ome means or other, though at a hundred miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>A little way from home he had a cock-walk, and at the next hou&s;e there chanced to be another. The owner of the cock at the latter hou&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing that Metcalf's and his would meet, armed his own cock with a &s;teel &s;pur; which greatly di&s;plea&s;ing Metcalf, he formed a plan of revenge; and getting one of his comrades to a&s;&s;i&s;t, they procured a quantity of cabbage-leaves, and fa&s;tening
<PB N="13" REF="19">
them together with &s;kewers, they fixed them again&s;t the out&s;ide of the windows, that the family might not perceive the return of day|light; and that they &s;hould al&s;o be pri&s;oners, the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates in roguery walled up the door with &s;tones, and mud-mortar, which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making by the convenience of a pump which &s;tood near. They then brought water, in tubs, and continued pour|ing it in great quantities over the new wall, (which did not reach quite up to the top of the door-frame) until the hou&s;e was flooded to a great depth. This done, they made the be&s;t of their way home.</P>
<P>In the morning, the people of the hou&s;e finding their &s;ituation, and being at no lo&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e who had been the projector, and in all probability the leading performer, of the bu&s;ine&s;s, were no &s;ooner &s;et at liberty, than they went to a Ju&s;tice, and got a war|rant for Metcalf; but not being able to prove the fact, he was, of cour&s;e, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>His fame now began to &s;pread; and when
<PB N="14" REF="20">
any arch trick was done, inquiry was &s;ure to be made where Metcalf had been at the time.</P>
<P>At Bilton, two miles from Knare&s;borough, there was a rookery, and the boys had made many attempts to take the young ones; but the owner wi&s;hing to pre&s;erve them, they were prevented. Metcalf determining to make a trial, &s;ent one of his comrades in the day-time as a &s;py to reconnoitre the po&s;ition of the ne&s;ts; and having been informed by him as to this, they &s;et out in the dead of night, and brought away &s;even dozen and a half, excepting the <HI>heads,</HI> which they left under the trees. The owner of the rooks finding the heads, &s;ent the bellman round, offering a reward of two guineas for di&s;co|vering the offenders: the &s;ecret, however, was kept until long afterwards.</P>
<P>A man at Knare&s;borough having married a woman who had lived at a farm-hou&s;e about a mile di&s;tant, brought his wife to his own home; and &s;ome articles being left in the de&s;erted hou&s;e, he &s;ent a &s;on he had by a former marriage to bring them away.&mdash;<PB N="15" REF="21">
Metcalf being about the &s;ame age as this boy, cho&s;e to accompany him. When they got to the place, the boy mi&s;&s;ed the key, which he had lo&s;t from his pocket by the way; and being afraid to return without his errand, he con&s;ulted Metcalf about what was to be done. Metcalf was for entering the hou&s;e at all events; and not being able to procure a ladder, got a pole, which reached to the thatch, and having borrowed a rope and a &s;tick, he climbed up the pole, and then a&s;|cending by the roof to the chimney, he placed the &s;tick acro&s;s, and fa&s;tening the rope to it, attempted to de&s;cend, but finding the flew too narrow, he threw off his cloaths, and laying them on the ridge of the hou&s;e, made a &s;econd attempt, and &s;ucceeded: he then opened the door for his companion. While they were in the hou&s;e, there was a heavy thunder-&s;hower, to which Metcalf's cloathes were expo&s;ed, being left upon the hou&s;e-top: he attempted to get up again, to fetch them; but the pole by which he had a&s;cended was now &s;o wet, that he could not
<PB N="16" REF="22">
climb by it; he was therefore obliged to wait until it dried, when a&s;cending again, he recovered his cloathes. This was con|&s;idered by all who heard of it as a very extraordinary performance by one in his &s;ituation, as well as a great act of friend&s;hip to his companion.</P>
<P>In the year 1732 Metcalf was invited to Harrogate, to &s;ucceed, as fidler, a poor old man who had played there for 70 years, and who, being borne down by the weight of 100 years, began to play too &s;low for coun|try dancing. Metcalf was well received by the nobility and gentry, who employed no other fidler, except a boy whom he hired as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, when they began to build a long-room at the Queen's Head.</P>
<P>Being once, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, at Ripon a&s;&s;embly, they re&s;olved to call the next day at Newby Hall, the &s;eat of 'Squire Blacket; having got acquainted with that worthy family by their frequent vi&s;its to Harrogate. There they &s;tayed, regaling them&s;elves, till near night, when they &s;et out for home.
<PB N="17" REF="23">
In the way, they had to cro&s;s the river Ure by a ford, or go round by Boroughbridge or Ripon, which latter Metcalf was not inclined to do. They were told that the ford would be found impa&s;&s;able, much rain having fallen. Metcalf, however, was determined to try; but on coming to the water-&s;ide, he found his companion was much in liquor, and began to doubt of <HI>his</HI> getting over: as for him&s;elf, he had no fear, being a good &s;wimmer.&mdash;So it was agreed that Metcalf &s;hould &s;trip, and (leaving his cloathes to the care of his friend) lead his hor&s;e over, and thereby prove whether or not it was &s;afe for his comrade to follow. By this means they got over, but not before it was dark. He then began to dre&s;s him&s;elf, but his wai&s;tcoat (in which were the three joints of his haut|boy) was mi&s;&s;ing, as al&s;o his &s;ilver &s;hoe|buckles, and &s;eventeen &s;hillings which fell from his pocket. This was an unplea&s;ant accident, but there being no pre&s;ent remedy, they made the be&s;t of their way to Copgrove, where they re&s;ted. Metcalf li&s;tened dili|gently
<PB N="18" REF="24">
to the clock, and after &s;ome hours, &s;uppo&s;ing the waters to have abated, (which was the ca&s;e,) he returned, and found his &s;eventeen &s;hillings on the bank, and a buckle on each &s;ide of the water. The wai&s;tcoat and hautboy he could never recover, although he carefully drew the deeps with a gardener's iron rake, which he had procured for that purpo&s;e at Newby Hall.</P>
<P>Metcalf now bought a hor&s;e, and often ran him for &s;mall plates. He &s;till continued to be a cocker&mdash;often hunted&mdash;and &s;ome|times went a cour&s;ing; in the evenings he attended to play at the a&s;&s;emblies: finding, from the&s;e various pur&s;uits, pretty &s;ufficient employment. Being greatly encouraged by the gentlemen, he began to think him&s;elf of that cla&s;s, excepting that his <HI>rents</HI> failed to come in half-yearly from his tenants.</P>
<P>About this time there was a long-room built at the Green-Dragon at Harrogate. More mu&s;ic being then wanted, he engaged one Midgeley (one of the Leeds waits) and
<PB N="19" REF="25">
his &s;on, as a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Midgeley, &s;en. being a good performer, was taken into partner&s;hip gratis; but the &s;on, and Metcalf's former a&s;&s;i&s;tant, paid five pounds each premium. This was done with the approbation of all the innkeepers, who wi&s;hed to keep Metcalf at the head of the band.</P>
<P>In the year 1735, Francis Barlow, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Middlethorp, near York, who kept a pack of beagles, was at Harrogate, and liking Met|calf, gave him an invitation to &s;pend the winter at Middlethorp, de&s;iring him to bring his hor&s;e: the invitation was gladly accepted, and he went out with Mr. Barlow's hounds twice a week, highly gratified in the enjoy|ment of his favourite &s;port. While at Mid|dlethorp, he was invited by Mr. Hebdin, an eminent mu&s;ician, of York, to come to his hou&s;e, and play, offering him, gratis, any &s;ervice or in&s;truction in his power: this kind offer Metcalf readily accepted, and went to practice mu&s;ic on tho&s;e days when there was no hunting.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">He had now completed a vi&s;it of &s;ix months to the worthy 'Squire of Middle|thorpe;&mdash;and the hunting &s;ea&s;on being almo&s;t over, he propo&s;ed to his patron to take a farewell hunt in the forenoon, intending to proceed to Knare&s;borough in the evening.&mdash;He accordingly &s;et out with the hounds in the morning; returned with the 'Squire at noon; got him&s;elf and his hor&s;e well fed and <HI>watered,</HI> and then pro|ceeded to York, to take leave of Mr. Heb|din, previous to his going home. He had learned to walk, and ride very readily through mo&s;t of the &s;treets of York; and as he was riding pa&s;t the George Inn, in Coney&s;treet, Standi&s;h, the landlord, &s;topped him, calling out <Q REND="inline">"What ha&s;te?"</Q> Metcalf told him he was for Knare&s;borough that night&mdash;The landlord replied, that there was a gentleman in the hou&s;e who wanted a guide to Harro|gate; adding, <Q REND="inline">"I know you can do that as well as any one."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So I can,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"but you mu&s;t not let him know that I am blind, for perhaps he will be afraid to tru&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="27">
me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> &s;hall manage that,"</Q> replied Stan|di&s;h; &s;o going in, he informed the gentle|man that he had procured him a &s;afe guide. Plea&s;ed at this, the gentleman reque&s;ted that Metcalf would come in and take a bottle: this (for an obvious rea&s;on) the landlord ob|jected to on the part of Metcalf, but recom|mended &s;ome wine at the door; during the drinking of which, the &s;tranger got ready, and they &s;et off, Metcalf taking the lead. As they were turning Ou&s;egate corner, a voice halloed out <Q REND="inline">"<HI>'Squire Barlow's Blind Hunt&s;man!</HI>"</Q> but the gentleman not know|ing the meaning of this, they rode bri&s;kly up Micklegate, through the Bar, turned the corner to Holgate, and through Poppleton Field on to He&s;&s;ay Moor, and &s;o proceeded forward, going over Skip-Bridge. (At this time the turnpike was not made between York and Harrogate.)</P>
<P>On the North-We&s;t end of Kirk-Hammer|ton Moor, the road to Knare&s;borough joined the main road which leads to Boroughbridge by a &s;udden turn to the left; but Metcalf
<PB N="22" REF="28">
cleared that without any difficulty. When they came to Allerton-Mauleverer, the &s;tran|ger a&s;ked who&s;e large hou&s;e that was on the right; and was immediately informed by Metcalf. A little farther on, the road is cro&s;&s;ed by the one from Wetherby to Bo|roughbridge, and proceeds along by the high brick wall of Allerton Park. There was a road leading out of the Park, oppo&s;ite to the gate upon the Knare&s;borough road, which Metcalf was afraid of mi&s;&s;ing; but the wind being from the Ea&s;t, and he per|ceiving a bla&s;t coming through the Park|gate, he readily turned his hor&s;e to the oppo|&s;ite gate which leads to Knare&s;borough. Reaching out his hand to open it, he felt the heel, as it is called; and, backing his hor&s;e, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Confound thee! thou always goes to the gate heel, in&s;tead of the head."</Q> The gentleman ob&s;erved to him that his hor&s;e &s;eemed aukward, and that his own mare was good at coming up to a gate; whereupon Metcalf permitted him to per|form this office. Darkne&s;s (which had now
<PB N="23" REF="29">
come on) being no ob&s;truction to him, he bri&s;kly led the way, re&s;olved that his com|panion &s;hould not again &s;ee his face till they got to Harrogate. As they were going through Knare&s;borough, the gentleman pro|po&s;ed a gla&s;s of wine, which Metcalf refu&s;ed, alledging that the hor&s;es were hot, and that being near their journey's end, it was not worth while to &s;top:&mdash;On then they went; and pre&s;ently &s;ome one cried out <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That's Blind Jack!</HI>"</Q>&mdash;This a&s;&s;ertion, however, was contradicted by another per&s;on who could not clearly identify him; and by this means the &s;tranger was kept in the <HI>dark</HI> as effectu|ally as his guide. They then proceeded over the High Bridge, and up the Fore&s;t Lane, and then entering the Fore&s;t, they had to pa&s;s along a narrow cau&s;eway which reached about one-third of the way to Harrogate. When they had gone a little way upon the Fore&s;t, the gentleman &s;aw a light, and a&s;ked what place it was. There were &s;ome rocks upon the Fore&s;t called Hook&s;ton Craggs, and near to the&s;e the ground was low and
<PB N="24" REF="30">
&s;wampy in &s;ome places, clo&s;e by which lays the Leeds road;&mdash;about this part were fre|quently &s;een at night, vapours, commonly called Will-o'-the-wi&s;p. Metcalf took it for granted that his companion had &s;een one of the&s;e, but for good rea&s;ons declined a&s;king him whereabout the light was; and to divert his attention from this object, a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">"Do you not &s;ee two lights; one to the right, the other to the left?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> replied the gentleman; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;een but one light, that there on the right."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well then, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Metcalf, <Q REND="inline">"that is Harrogate."</Q> There were then many tracks, but Metcalf made choice of that neare&s;t the fence: by the &s;ide of this path, which is very near Harrogate, &s;ome larc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s were planted; and &s;tepping-&s;tones laid for the convenience of foot-pa&s;&s;engers: Metcalf got upon this &s;tony path, and the gentleman's hor&s;e following, got one of his hind feet jammed between two of the &s;tones: when his hor&s;e was freed, he a&s;ked <Q REND="inline">"Is there no other road?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> replied Metcalf, <Q REND="inline">"there is another, but
<PB N="25" REF="31">
it is a mile about:"</Q> knowing at the &s;ame time that there was a dirty cart-way ju&s;t at hand, but to which upon &s;ome account he preferred this rugged path.</P>
<P>Arrived at their journey's end, they &s;top|ped at the hou&s;e now called the Granby, but found that the o&s;tler was gone to bed.&mdash;Metcalf being very well acquainted with the place, led both the hor&s;es into the &s;table, and the o&s;tler &s;oon after appearing, he delivered them to his care, and went into the hou&s;e to inquire after his fel|low-traveller, whom he found comfortably &s;eated over a tankard of negus, in which he pledged his guide; but when Metcalf at|tempted to take the tankard, he reached out his hand wide of the mark: however, he &s;oon found it, and drank; and going out again, left to the landlord the opportunity of explaining to his companion what he was not yet &s;en&s;ible of.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think, landlord,"</Q> &s;aid the gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"my guide mu&s;t have drank a great deal of &s;pirits &s;ince we came here."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, my good Sir, do you think
<PB N="26" REF="32">
&s;o?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, I judge &s;o from the appear|ance of his <HI>eyes.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eyes!</HI> ble&s;s you, Sir,"</Q> rejoined the landlord, <Q REND="inline">"do not you know that he is BLIND?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by that?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I mean, Sir, that <HI>he cannot &s;ee.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"BLIND! Gracious God!!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; as blind as a &s;tone, by Heaven!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, landlord,"</Q> &s;aid the gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"this is too much: call him in."</Q> Metcalf enters. <Q REND="inline">"My friend, are you really blind?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; I lo&s;t my &s;ight when &s;ix years old."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Had I known that, I would not have ven|tured with you for an hundred pounds."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And I, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Metcalf,
<Q REND="inline">"would not have lo&s;t my way for a thou&s;and."</Q>
This conver&s;ation ended, they &s;at down, and drank plentifully. Metcalf had with him a ca&s;e containing a new fiddle which he had ju&s;t received from London, and the gentle|man ob&s;erving it, de&s;ired him to play: the guide gave him as much &s;atisfaction in this way, as he had before done in the character of a conductor; and the &s;ervices of the evening were rewarded by a pre&s;ent of two
<PB N="27" REF="33">
guineas, be&s;ides a plentiful entertainment the next day, at the co&s;t of this gentleman, who looked upon the adventure with Met|calf as the mo&s;t extraordinary incident he had ever met with.</P>
<P>1736. The Harrogate &s;ea&s;on now com|mencing, Metcalf, of cour&s;e, re&s;umed his occupation; and, being of a jocular and comic turn, was &s;o well received at all the inns, that he obtained free quarters for him&s;elf and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Green Dragon at that place was then kept by a Mr. Body, who had two nephews with him; and when the hunting &s;ea&s;on drew near its clo&s;e, the&s;e with &s;ome other young men expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire for a day's &s;port; and knowing that Mr. Wood|burn, the ma&s;ter of the Knare&s;borough pack of hounds, had often lent them to Metcalf for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they doubted not of the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>his</HI> application: being, how|ever, unprovided with hunters, they were obliged to defer the day for near a fortnight before they could be accommodated.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">On the evening before the appointed day, Metcalf went, flu&s;hed with hope, to Mr. Woodburn, reque&s;ting him to lend the pack for the next day. This was a favour out of his power to grant, having engaged to meet 'Squire Trapps, with the hounds, next morning, upon Scotton Moor, for the pur|po&s;e of entering &s;ome young fox-hounds.&mdash;Chagrined at this, Metcalf debated with him&s;elf whether the di&s;appointment &s;hould fall to Mr. Woodburn's friends, or his own: determining that it &s;hould not be the lot of the latter, he aro&s;e the next morning before day-break, and cro&s;&s;ed the High Bridge, near which he had the advantage of the joint echos of the Old Ca&s;tle and Belmont Wood. He had brought with him an extraordinary good hound of his own, and taking him by the ears, made him give mouth very loudly, him&s;elf giving &s;ome halloos at the &s;ame time. This device had &s;o good an effect, that in a few minutes he had nine couple about him, as the hounds were kept by various people about the &s;hambles, &amp;c. and were &s;uffered to
<PB N="29" REF="35">
lay unkennelled. Mounting his hor&s;e, away he rode with the dogs to Harrogate, where he met his friends, ready mounted, and in high &s;pirits. Some of them propo&s;ed going to Bilton Wood; but this was oppo&s;ed by Metcalf, who preferred the Moor: in fact, he was apprehen&s;ive of being followed by Mr. Woodburn, and wi&s;hed to be further from Knare&s;borough upon that account.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to his advice, they drew the Moor, at the di&s;tance of five miles, where they &s;tarted a hare, killed her after a fine chace, and immediately put up another:&mdash;ju&s;t at this moment came up Mr. Woodburn, foaming with anger, &s;wearing mo&s;t terribly, and threatening to &s;end Metcalf to the devil, or at lea&s;t to the hou&s;e of correction; and, his pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;ing to the utmo&s;t, rode up with an intention to hor&s;ewhip him, which Metcalf prevented, by galloping out of his reach.&mdash;Mr. Woodburn then endeavoured to call off the hounds; but Metcalf, knowing the fleet|ne&s;s of his own hor&s;e, ventured within &s;peak|ing, though not within <HI>whipping,</HI> di&s;tance of
<PB N="30" REF="36">
him, and begged that he would permit the dogs to fini&s;h the chace, alledging that it would &s;poil them to take them off; and that he was &s;ure they would (as they actually did) kill in a very &s;hort time. Metcalf &s;oon found that Mr. Woodburn's anger had begun to abate; and going nearer to him, pleaded in excu&s;e a mi&s;under&s;tanding of his plan, which he &s;aid he thought had been fixed for the day after. The apology &s;ucceeded with this good-natured gentleman, who, giving the hare to Metcalf, de&s;ired he would accom|pany him to Scotton Moor, whither, though late, he would go, rather than wholly di&s;|appoint Mr. Trapps. The reader, by this time, knows enough of Metcalf to believe he was not aver&s;e to this propo&s;al; &s;o leaving the hares with his comrades, and engaging to be with them in the evening, he joined his old a&s;&s;ociate. The day being advanced, Metcalf objected to the circuitous way of Harrogate Bridge, propo&s;ing to cro&s;s the river Nidd at Holm Bottom; and Mr. Wood|burn not being acquainted with the ford,
<PB N="31" REF="37">
he again undertook the office of guide, and leading the way, they &s;oon arrived at Scot|ton Moor, where Mr. Trapps and his com|pany had waited for them two hours. Mr. Woodburn explained the cau&s;e of the delay, and, being now able to participate in the joke, the affair ended very agreeably.</P>
<P>Metcalf &s;tayed with this company until three in the afternoon, and then &s;et off for Harrogate, cro&s;&s;ing the river. He had not ta&s;ted food that day; but when he got to his friends, he found them preparing the brace of hares, with many other good things, for &s;upper; and after &s;pending many jovial hours, he played country-dances till day|light.</P>
<P>When the Harrogate &s;ea&s;on was over, it was Metcalf's con&s;tant cu&s;tom to vi&s;it at the inns, always &s;pending the evening at one or other of them. At the Royal Oak (now the Granby) in particular, &s;cenes of mirth were often going forward; and at the&s;e he greatly attracted the notice of one of the land|lord's daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38">In the &s;ummer he u&s;ed often to run his hor&s;e for the petty plates or prizes given at the fea&s;ts in the neighbourhood; and on all the&s;e occa&s;ions, when in her power, &s;he was &s;ure to attend, with her female friends. By frequent intercour&s;e, the lady and Metcalf became very intimate; and this intimacy produced mutual regard and confidence. Her mother being a high-&s;pirited woman, had brought up her daughters, as &s;he hoped at lea&s;t, with notions ill &s;uited to the condi|tion of Metcalf; &s;o that in order to di&s;gui&s;e the &s;tate of their hearts from her parents, the lovers agreed on a &s;et of names and phra&s;es, intelligible to each other, though not &s;o to them. He u&s;ed to call him&s;elf Mary, or Tibby, (at once changing the &s;ex, and &s;peaking as if of a third per&s;on); and &s;he, Harry, or Dickey, or &s;ome &s;uch name. Whenever he &s;ought to intimate to her his intention of vi&s;iting her, he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t tell Richard that Mary will be here on &s;uch a day."</Q> Her mother would perhaps
<PB N="33" REF="39">
a&s;k, <Q REND="inline">"Who is that?"</Q> To which &s;he would reply, that it was a young woman who was to meet her brother there.&mdash;But if the day appointed by Metcalf was not convenient, &s;he would &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"Richard had called, and had left word that Mary &s;hould call again at &s;uch a time;"</Q> meaning the time &s;he wi&s;hed Metcalf to come.&mdash;And as &s;he com|monly fa&s;tened the doors, when &s;he expected him &s;he always left a door or a window open.</P>
<P>One night, in particular, Metcalf having, in con&s;equence of an appointment, arrived there about midnight, and got in by a window that had been de&s;ignedly left open; in his way to the <HI>young</HI> woman's room, he met the <HI>old</HI> one in the middle of the &s;tair-ca&s;e! Both parties were much &s;urpri&s;ed; and the mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;king angrily <Q REND="inline">"Who's there?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What do you want?"</Q> he knowing that &s;he always went to bed early, replied <Q REND="inline">"I came in late la&s;t night, &s;at down in a chair by the fire|&s;ide, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep."</Q> She then called
<PB N="34" REF="40">
loudly to her daughter, <Q REND="inline">"Why did you not &s;hew Jack to bed?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I was not to &s;it up all night for him;"</Q> replied the la&s;s. He then pur&s;ued his way up &s;tairs, and the girl con|ducted him to a bed-room.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer he would often play at bowls, making the following conditions with his antagoni&s;t, viz. to receive the odds of a bowl extra for the deficiency of an eye.&mdash;By the&s;e terms he had three for the other's one. He took care to place a friend and confidant at the jack, and another about mid-way; and tho&s;e, keeping up a con&s;tant di&s;cour&s;e with him, enabled him, by their voices, to judge of the di&s;tance. The degree of bias he could always a&s;certain by feeling; and, odd as it may &s;eem, was very frequently the winner.</P>
<P>Cards, too, began to engage his attention; all of which he could &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and many were the per&s;ons of rank who, from curio&s;ity, played with him, he generally winning the majority of the games.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41">But the atchievements already enumerated were far from bounding either his ambition or capacity: He now a&s;pired to the acquaint|ance of jockies of a higher cla&s;s than he had hitherto known, and to this end frequented the races at York and many other places; when he always found the better kind of per|&s;ons inclined to lend him their &s;kill in making his bets, &amp;c. impre&s;&s;ed, as they no doubt were, with &s;ympathy for his &s;ituation, and &s;urprize at his odd propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>He commonly rode to the race-ground among&s;t the crowd; and kept in memory both the winning and lo&s;ing hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Being much in the habit of vi&s;iting York in the winter time, a whim would often take him to call for his hor&s;e at bed-time, and &s;et out for Knare&s;borough, regardle&s;s of the bad|ne&s;s of the roads and weather, and of all remon&s;trance from his friends; yet the hand of Providence always conducted him in &s;afety.&mdash;It was quite common for him to go from Skipton, over the Fore&s;t Moor, to Knare&s;|borough, alone; but if he had company,
<PB N="36" REF="42">
and it was night, he was, of cour&s;e, the foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>About the year 1738, Metcalf having increa&s;ed his &s;tud, and being aware of the docility of that noble animal, the hor&s;e, &s;o tutored his own, that whenever he called them by their re&s;pective names, they would immediately an&s;wer him by neighing. This was chiefly accompli&s;hed by &s;ome di&s;cipline at the time of feeding. He could, however, without the help of tho&s;e re&s;pon&s;es, &s;elect his own hor&s;es out of any number.</P>
<P>Having matched one of his hor&s;es, to run three miles, for a wager of &s;ome note, and the parties agreeing to ride each his own, they &s;et up po&s;ts at certain di&s;tances, on the Fore&s;t, including a circle of one mile; having, of cour&s;e, three rounds to go. Great odds were laid again&s;t Metcalf, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of his inability to keep the cour&s;e. But what did his ingenuity &s;ugge&s;t in this dilemma: or, rather, what did it anticipate? He procured four dinner-bells from the different inns, with what others he
<PB N="37" REF="43">
could borrow; and placing a man, with a bell, at each po&s;t, he was enabled, by the ringing, to turn; and fully availing him|&s;elf of the &s;uperior fleetne&s;s of his hor&s;e, came in winner, amid&s;t the plaudits and exultations of the multitude, except only tho&s;e who had betted again&s;t him.</P>
<P>A gentleman of the name of Skelton then came up, and propo&s;ed to Metcalf a &s;mall wager, that he could not gallop a hor&s;e of his fifty yards, and &s;top him within two hundred. This hor&s;e was notorious as a run-away, and had baffled the efforts of the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t riders to hold him. Met|calf agreed to the wager, upon condition that he might choo&s;e his ground; but Skel|ton objected to there being either hedge or wall in the di&s;tance. Metcalf, every ready at any thing that was likely to produce a joke, agreed; the &s;takes were depo&s;ited; and knowing that there was a large bog near the Old Spa at Harrogate, he mounted at about the di&s;tance of an hundred and fifty yards from it. Having ob&s;erved the wind,
<PB N="38" REF="44">
and placed a per&s;on who was to &s;ing a &s;ong, for the guidance of &s;ound, he &s;et off, at full gallop, for the bog, and &s;oon fixed the hor&s;e &s;addle-&s;kirt deep in the mire. He then floundered through the dirt as well as he was able, till he gained a firm footing; when he demanded his wager, which was allotted him by the general &s;uffrage. It was with the greate&s;t difficulty, however, that the hor&s;e could be extricated.&mdash;That Metcalf was &s;o well acquainted with this &s;pot, was owing to his having, about three weeks before, relieved a &s;tranger who had got fa&s;t in it in the night, and who&s;e cries had attracted him.</P>
<P>It was now no unu&s;ual thing with him to buy hor&s;es, with a view to &s;ell them again. Happening to meet with a man who had left the place of hunt&s;man to a pack of &s;ub|&s;cription hounds kept by Sir John Kaye, 'Squire Hawke&s;worth, and others, and who had a hor&s;e to &s;ell, Metcalf inquired his price, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting per|mi&s;&s;ion to ride him a little way. Having
<PB N="39" REF="45">
trotted the hor&s;e a mile or two, he returned, telling the owner that the <HI>eyes</HI> of his nag would &s;oon fail. The man, however, &s;tood firm to his demand of twenty-five guineas for the hor&s;e, alledging that he was beauti|fully moulded, only &s;ix years old, and his action good. Metcalf then took the man into the &s;table, and de&s;ired him to lay his hand upon the eyes of the hor&s;e, to feel their uncommon heat; a&s;king him, at the &s;ame time, how he could, in con&s;cience, demand &s;o great a price for a hor&s;e that was going blind. This treaty ended with Met|calf's purcha&s;ing the hor&s;e, bridle, and &s;ad|dle, for fourteen pounds.</P>
<P>A few days after, as he was riding on his new purcha&s;e, he ran again&s;t a &s;ign-po&s;t, upon the Common, near the Toy-Shop, and nearly threw it down. Not di&s;couraged by this, he &s;et off for Ripon, to play at an a&s;&s;embly; and pa&s;&s;ing by a place at Harro|gate called the World's-End, he overtook a man going the Ripon road.&mdash;With him Metcalf laid a wager of &s;ix-pennyworth of
<PB N="40" REF="46">
liquor, that he would get fir&s;t to an alehou&s;e at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance. The ground being rough, Metcalf's hor&s;e &s;oon fell, and lay for a while on the thigh of his ma&s;ter, when, making an effort to ri&s;e, he cut Metcalf's face with one of his fore &s;hoes. The Rev. Mr. Richard&s;on coming up at this moment, and expre&s;&s;ing his concern for the accident, Metcalf told him that nothing had hurt him but the cowardice of his hor&s;e, who had <HI>&s;truck him whil&s;t he was down.</HI> His in&s;tru|ment, however, &s;uffered &s;o materially, that he was obliged to borrow one to perform on for the night, at Ripon, to which place he got without further accident. The a&s;&s;embly over, he &s;et off to return to Harrogate, and arrived there about three in the morning.</P>
<P>He now thought it was time to di&s;po&s;e of his fine hor&s;e, who&s;e eyes began to di&s;charge much. After applying the u&s;ual remedies of allum blown into the eyes, roweling in different parts, &amp;c. he found him in market|able condition; and knowing that there would &s;oon be a great &s;hew of hor&s;es with|out
<PB N="41" REF="47">
Micklegate-Bar, at York, he re&s;olved to take the chance of that mart; and &s;etting out the night before, put up at the Swan, in Micklegate. The next morning, when the &s;hew began, Metcalf's nag attracted the notice of one Carter, a very exten&s;ive dealer, who a&s;king the price, was told twenty-two guineas. Carter then inquired if he was found, and received for an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"I have never known him <HI>lame;</HI> but I &s;hall trot him on this pavement, and if there be any ail|ment of that kind, it will &s;oon appear, with my weight."</Q> The dealer bade him &s;ixteen guineas, and a little after, &s;eventeen; which Metcalf, for well-known rea&s;ons, was glad to receive.</P>
<P>Having &s;old his hor&s;e, he &s;et off on foot for Harrogate; but before he had got to Holgate (about a mile on his way) he was overtaken by a Knare&s;borough man, on hor&s;eback, who propo&s;ed, for two &s;hillings-worth of punch, to let him ride in turn, dividing the di&s;tances equally. Metcalf thought the man was unrea&s;onable in his
<PB N="42" REF="48">
demand, but agreed to it at length; and giving his companion one tankard, he, by con&s;ent, got the fir&s;t ride, with in&s;tructions to the following effect, viz. That he &s;hould ride on till he got a little beyond Poppleton-Field, where he would <HI>&s;ee</HI> a gate on his right hand, to which he &s;hould fa&s;ten the hor&s;e, and leaving him for the owner, proceed. Metcalf not <HI>&s;eeing</HI> the gate, as de&s;cribed, rode on to Knare&s;borough, which was &s;even|teen miles from the place where he had left his fellow-traveller. He then left the hor&s;e at the owner's hou&s;e, &s;aying that the ma&s;ter having got into a return-chai&s;e, had de|&s;ired him to ride the hor&s;e home.&mdash;The owner was greatly enraged at being le&s;t to walk &s;o long a way; but, on Metcalf's pleading that he never <HI>&s;aw</HI> the gate, he found it his intere&s;t to join in the laugh.</P>
<P>Being now in the prime of life, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a peculiar archne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, with an uncea&s;ing flow of &s;pirits, and a contempt of danger, &s;eldom if ever equalled by one in his circum&s;tances, it will not be wondered at
<PB N="43" REF="49">
that levities, &s;uch as are before recited, &s;hould have employed a con&s;iderable portion of his time. The &s;equel, however, will, in due cour&s;e, &s;hew, that he was capable of embarking in, and bringing to perfection, &s;everal &s;chemes, of public as well as private utility; and this promi&s;e to the reader, it is hoped, will in&s;ure his patience, while he is made the companion of the author in a few more of his frolic&s;ome adventures.</P>
<P>In the year 1738 Metcalf attained the age of twenty-one years, and the height of &s;ix feet one inch and an half, and was remark|ably robu&s;t withal.</P>
<P>At that time there lived at Knare&s;borough one John Bake, a man of a ferocious temper and athletic figure. He was con&s;idered in the neighbourhood as a champion, or rather bully; and thus qualified, was often em|ployed <HI>&s;pecially,</HI> to &s;erve writs or warrants, in ca&s;es where de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance was ex|pected. Metcalf going one evening, with a friend, to a public hou&s;e, they there met this Bake; and a &s;hort time after, Metcalf's
<PB N="44" REF="50">
and Bake &s;at down to cards. The latter took &s;ome money off the table, to which he was not entitled; and the former remon|&s;trating on the inju&s;tice of Bake, received from him a violent blow. Metcalf interpo&s;ing with words only at fir&s;t, was treated in the &s;ame manner; when in&s;tantly entering into combat with this ruffian, he be&s;towed upon him &s;uch di&s;cipline as &s;oon extorted a cry for mercy.</P>
<P>To the fame which Metcalf had acquired by various means, was now added that of a boxer, though he was far from being ambi|tious of celebrity in that way. Some little time after, Metcalf was called up at midnight by this very Bake, who, knowing by experi|ence the prowe&s;s and powers of his late anta|goni&s;t, had pre&s;umed to make a bet of five guineas, that Metcalf would beat a fellow who&s;e company he had ju&s;t left.&mdash;But Met|calf gave him to under&s;tand, that, although he had &s;tore of thumps for tho&s;e who &s;hould treat him with in&s;olence, he was no prize-fighter; and having no quarrel with the man
<PB N="45" REF="51">
in que&s;tion, he (Bake) might fight or forfeit as he liked be&s;t.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of getting a little fi&s;h, he once, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, drew a net of eighty yards length, in the deepe&s;t part of the river Wharfe, for three hours together. At one time he held the lines in his mouth, being obliged to &s;wim.</P>
<P>The following wager he laid, and won: He engaged with a man at the Queen's Head at Harrogate, to go to Knare&s;borough Cro&s;s, and return, in le&s;s time than the other would gather one hundred and twenty &s;tones, laid at regular di&s;tances of a yard each, and, taking one &s;tone at a time, put them all into a ba&s;ket placed at one end of the line.</P>
<P>Meeting with &s;ome company, among&s;t whom there was one of a boa&s;tful turn, Metcalf propo&s;ed to go again&s;t him from Harrogate to Knare&s;borough Cro&s;s, provided he would take the way which Metcalf &s;hould choo&s;e. To this the other agreed, believing that he could ea&s;ily keep pace with Metcalf till he &s;hould arrive within &s;ight of the Cro&s;s,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
and that he could then pu&s;h forward, and beat him. But when they got within half a mile of the town, Metcalf quitted the road which leads over the High Bridge, and, knowing that his antagoni&s;t could not &s;wim, made for a deep part of the river above Bridge, and dive&s;ting him&s;elf of his upper drapery, &s;wam acro&s;s; at the &s;ame time cal|ling out jeeringly to his adver&s;ary, <Q REND="inline">"that he hoped for the plea&s;ure of his company up to the Cro&s;s."</Q> The other, not liking to com|mit him&s;elf to the water, gave up the wager.</P>
<P>About this time, Dr. Chambers, of Ripon, had a well-made hor&s;e, which he u&s;ed to hunt; but finding that latterly he became a great &s;tumbler, he exchanged him with a dealer, who took him to Harrogate, and meeting with Metcalf, told him he had an excellent hunter to &s;ell at a low price.&mdash;Metcalf de&s;ired to try how the hor&s;e leaped, and the owner agreeing, he mounted him, and found that he could go over any wall or fence, the height of him&s;elf when &s;addled. A bargain was &s;oon &s;truck; and this hap|pening
<PB N="47" REF="53">
at the Queen's Head, &s;everal gen|tlemen who were witne&s;&s;es of the hor&s;e's performance invited Metcalf to accompany them, two days after, to Belmont Wood, where a pack of hounds were to throw off.</P>
<P>The&s;e hounds were the joint property of Francis Trapps, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his brother, of Nidd, near Ripley. A pack &s;uperior to this was not to be found in the kingdom; nor were the owners them&s;elves ever excelled in their attention to their dogs and hunters.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed-for day arriving, Metcalf at|tended the gentlemen, and the hounds were not long in finding. The fox took away to Plumpton Rocks, but finding all &s;ecure there he made for Stockeld Wood, and found matters in the &s;ame &s;tate as at Plump|ton.&mdash;He had then run about &s;ix miles. He came back, and cro&s;&s;ed the river Nidd near the Old Abbey, and went on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Knare&s;borough, to a place called Coney-Garths (where there were earths) near Scriven. Metcalf's hor&s;e carried him nobly; pulling hard, and requiring propor|tionate
<PB N="48" REF="54">
re&s;i&s;tance. The wind being high, Metcalf lo&s;t his hat, but would not &s;top to recover it; and coming to Thi&s;tle-Hill, near Knare&s;borough, he re&s;olved to cro&s;s the river at the Abbey-Mill, having often before gone, <HI>on foot,</HI> over the dam-&s;tone. When he got to the dam, he attended to the noi&s;e of the fall, as a guide, and ranging his hor&s;e in a line with the &s;tones, da&s;hed forward for &s;ome part of the way; but the &s;tones being &s;lippery with a kind of mo&s;s, his hor&s;e &s;tum|bled, but recovered this and a &s;econd blun|der: the third time, however, floundering completely, away went hor&s;e and rider into the dam. Metcalf had pre&s;ence of mind to di&s;engage his feet from the &s;tirrups, during the de&s;cent; but both the hor&s;e and him&s;elf were immer&s;ed over head in water. He then quitted his &s;eat, and made for the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide, the hor&s;e following him. Having &s;ecured his nag, he laid him&s;elf down on his back, and held up his heels to let the water run out of his boots; which done, he quickly re-mounted, and went up a narrow lane
<PB N="49" REF="55">
which leads to the road between Knare&s;|borough and Wetherby; then through &s;ome lanes on the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide of Knare&s;|borough; and cro&s;&s;ing the Boroughbridge road, he got to the Coney-Garths, where he found that the whipper-in only had arrived before him.</P>
<P>Here the fox had earthed, as was expected; and the other hor&s;emen (who had gone over the Low Bridge, and through the town) after &s;ome time came up.&mdash;They were much &s;urpri&s;ed at finding Metcalf there, and attri|buted the &s;oaked condition of him&s;elf and hor&s;e to profu&s;e &s;weating; nor were they undeceived till (giving up the fox) they got to Scriven, where, upon an explanation of the affair, they laughed heartily.</P>
<P>In the circle of Metcalf's acquaintance at Knare&s;borough were two young men, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter lived with them in the capacity of hou&s;ekeeper; and &s;he being of a jocular turn, would often, on Metcalf's calling at the hou&s;e, propo&s;e &s;uch whim&s;ical &s;chemes to him, as gave him rea&s;on to believe that to
<PB N="50" REF="56">
laugh and be merry was the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of her life. However, &s;he one evening appri&s;ed him of her intention to pay him a vi&s;it in the night, and de&s;ired him to leave his door unlocked. A knowledge of the woman's mirthful propen&s;ity made him at fir&s;t con|&s;ider this as a joke; but, on the other hand, he though it <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that a <HI>real</HI> a&s;&s;ignation was intended; and being too gallant to di&s;appoint a <HI>lady,</HI> he told her he would obey her orders. Too &s;ure for the future peace of Metcalf, the lady was punctual to her appointment; coming at the dead time of night to his mother's hou&s;e, unawed at pa&s;|&s;ing by the <HI>church,</HI> who&s;e &s;anction was want|ing. It would be impertinent to derain the reader on the &s;ubject of the meeting: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that Metcalf too had unfortunately left his &s;cruples at another hou&s;e. In a few months after, this tender creature acco&s;ted him in the u&s;ual way&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am ruined!&mdash;undone!&mdash;lo&s;t for ever, if you do not make an hone&s;t woman of me!&mdash;" &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">Whatever compunction Metcalf might have felt in a ca&s;e of confiding innocence, pleading for the only compen&s;ation in his power, he did not think his con&s;cience very deeply intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ent: be&s;ides, his heart was &s;trongly attached to his fir&s;t truly re&s;pectable and worthy mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;His bu&s;i|ne&s;s, therefore, was to pacify a trouble&s;ome client, which he did in the be&s;t manner he was able. The adventure with this dulcinea had happened previous to the above-men|tioned hunt; but when Metcalf accompa|nied the gentlemen from the Coney-Garths to the village of Scriven, he there heard, on the authority of the landlord of the inn, that a woman had gone that day to filiate a child to him. He endeavoured to be merry on the occa&s;ion, alledging, that it could not be &s;o, as he had not <HI>&s;een</HI> the woman for &s;everal years. This produced a laugh among the company; but with Metcalf it &s;oon took a more &s;erious turn. On his return to Harro|gate he employed his fellow-fidler to procure a meeting between him and his favourite,
<PB N="52" REF="58">
Dorothy Ben&s;on, which was effected with &s;ome difficulty; and he took this occa&s;ion to inform her of his di&s;grace, judging it better to be before-hand with her, in a mat|ter which could not be long concealed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! John,"</Q> replied &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"thou ha&s;t got into a &s;ad &s;crape: but I intreat thee, do not think of marrying her."</Q> Having quieted the fears of his favourite on that &s;core, he de&s;ired his a&s;&s;i&s;tant to go with him to Knare&s;|borough, to <HI>&s;ound the coa&s;t;</HI> but before they had got half way, his companion exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Here is the Town-Officer coming!"</Q> Met|calf propo&s;ed walking &s;martly on, without noticing him; but when they got near, the Officer, who was a Quaker, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Stop, I want to &s;peak with thee."</Q> He then explained his errand, and pre&s;&s;ed Met|calf much to marry the woman; to which he replied, that he had no thoughts of mar|riage, and de&s;ired to know whether for thirty or forty pounds in money the matter might be made up. <Q REND="inline">"Yea, friend,"</Q> &s;aid Jonathan, <Q REND="inline">"perhaps I can &s;ettle the affair
<PB N="53" REF="59">
for thee on tho&s;e terms."</Q> On this, Metcalf ob&s;erved to him, that he mu&s;t go to Harro|gate, his money being there. The Quaker agreeing, they went together to a public-hou&s;e, where Metcalf called for a tankard of punch, drank part of it, and &s;eeming very chearful, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t go and collect my money: as it is in various hands, perhaps it will be an hour or more before I can return; &s;o drink your punch, and call for more."</Q> This pretext &s;ucceeding, he left Jonathan to regale him&s;elf at his own &s;uit; and choo&s;ing the mo&s;t private way to a thick wood, he there &s;ecreted him&s;elf all day. After &s;ome hours waiting, the man of the broad brim lo&s;t all patience, and &s;et out in que&s;t of his profane ward; when meeting a gentleman, he thus acco&s;ted him: <Q REND="inline">"Friend! have thee, perchance, &s;een a blind fidler?"</Q> The gen|tleman replied, <Q REND="inline">"I thought that a per&s;on of thy cloth had not wanted a fidler."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I tell thee I want one at this time,"</Q> quoth the Quaker; who, after &s;ome other fruitle&s;s inquiries, went home.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="60">At night, Metcalf ventured to break cover; and judging it un&s;afe to remain in the neighbourhood of the <HI>hounds,</HI> he gave his a&s;&s;i&s;tant directions to put his little affairs in order&mdash;then mounting his hor&s;e, he took the road for Scarborough.</P>
<P>As he was walking one day on the &s;ands, with a friend, he re&s;olved to take a &s;wim in the &s;ea, his companion agreeing to give him an halloo when he &s;hould think he had gone far enough outward; but the other, not making a &s;ufficient allowance for the noi&s;e of the &s;ea, &s;uffered him to go out of hearing before he &s;houted, and Metcalf continued &s;wimming until he got out of the &s;ight of his friend, who now &s;u&s;pected he &s;hould &s;ee him no more. At length he began to reflect, that, &s;hould he proceed on to Holland, he had nothing in his <HI>pocket</HI> to make him wel|come;&mdash;&s;o turning, and removing his hair from his ears, he thought he heard the breakers beating again&s;t the pier which defends the Spa: finding, by the noi&s;e, that
<PB N="55" REF="61">
he was at a great di&s;tance, he increa&s;ed his efforts, and happening to be right, he landed in &s;afety, and relieved his friend from a very painful &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Having an aunt at Whitby, near the Allum-works, he went there, left his hor&s;e, and got on board an allum &s;hip bound for London.</P>
<P>In London he met with a North-country man who played on the &s;mall pipes, and who frequented the hou&s;es of many gentle|men in town. By his intelligence Metcalf found out &s;everal who were in the habit of vi&s;iting Harrogate; and among&s;t others, Colonel Liddell, who re&s;ided in King-&s;treet, Covent-Garden, and who gave him a gene|ral invitation to his hou&s;e. The Colonel was a Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed, and lived at Raven&s;worth-Ca&s;tle, near Newca&s;tle-upon-Tyne; and on his return from London into the North, which generally happened in the month of May, he &s;topped three weeks at Harrogate, for a number of years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">When the winter was over, Metcalf thought he mu&s;t t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ke a <HI>look</HI> out of London. Accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;et out through Ken&s;ington, Hammer&s;mith, Colnbrook, Maidenhead, and Reading, in Berk&s;hire; and returned by Wind&s;or, and Hampton-Court, to London, in the beginning of May. In his ab&s;ence, Colonel Liddell had &s;ent to his lodgings, to let him know that he was going to Harrogate, and that, if agreeable to him, he might go down either behind his coach or on the top. Metcalf, on his return, waited upon the Colonel, and thanked him, but declined his kind offer, ob&s;erving, that he could, with great ea&s;e, walk as far in a day as he would choo&s;e to travel. The next day, at noon, the Colonel, and his &s;uite, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix|teen &s;ervants on hor&s;eback, &s;et off, Metcalf &s;tarting about an hour before them. They were to go by way of Bugd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and he made his way to Barnet. A little way from Barnet the Bugden and St. Albans roads part, and he had taken the latter: however, he made good the de&s;tined &s;tage for &s;leeping, which
<PB N="57" REF="63">
was Welling, and arrived a little before the Colonel, who was &s;urprized at his perform|ance. Metcalf &s;et off again the next morn|ing before his friends, and coming to Big|gle&s;wade, found the road was cro&s;&s;ed with water, there being no bridge at that time. He made a circuitous ca&s;t, but found no other way, except a foot-path which he was dubious of tru&s;ting. A per&s;on coming up, a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"What road are you for?"</Q>&mdash;He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"For Bugden."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You have had &s;ome liquor this morning, I &s;uppo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> replied Metcalf; al|though he had ta&s;ted none that day. The &s;tranger then bid him follow, and he would bring him into the highway. Soon after they came to &s;ome &s;luices, with planks laid acro&s;s, and Metcalf followed by the &s;ound of his guide's feet; then to a gate, on the &s;ide of the turnpike, which being locked, he was told to climb over. Metcalf was &s;truck with the kind attention of his conductor, and taking twopence from his pocket, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here, good fellow, take that, and get thee
<PB N="58" REF="64">
a pint of beer;"</Q> but the other declined it, &s;aying he was welcome. Metcalf, however, pre&s;&s;ing the reward upon him, was a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"Can you &s;ee very well?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Not remarkably well,"</Q> he replied. <Q REND="inline">"My friend,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"I do not mean to <HI>tythe</HI> you:&mdash;I am Rector of this pari&s;h; and &s;o God ble&s;s you, and I wi&s;h you a good journey."</Q> Met|calf &s;et forward with the par&s;on's benedic|tion, and &s;topped every night with the Colo|nel: On coming to Wetherby, he arrived at the inn before him, as u&s;ual, and told the landlord of his approach, who a&s;ked him by what means he had become acquainted with that, and was informed by him how he had preceded the Colonel the whole week, this being Saturday, and they had left town on Monday noon. The Colonel arriving, or|dered Metcalf into his room, and propo&s;ed halting till Monday; but Metcalf replied, <Q REND="inline">"With your leave, Sir, I &s;hall go to Harro|gate to night, and meet you there on Mon|day."</Q> In truth, he was anxious to know the wor&s;t re&s;pecting the woman who had
<PB N="59" REF="65">
been the cau&s;e of his journey; and was much plea&s;ed to find matters in a better train than he expected, &s;he being in a com|fortable way, and not inclined to be farther trouble&s;ome. Many friends vi&s;ited him on Sunday, and the next day the Colonel ar|rived. But of all his friends, the deare&s;t was at the Royal Oak: with her he had an affectionate meeting, after an ab&s;ence of &s;even months. During this interval a young man had been paying his addre&s;&s;es to her; and knowing that Metcalf was acquainted with the family, he &s;olicited him to u&s;e what intere&s;t he had in his behalf: this, when made known to the lady by the man of her heart, afforded them both great entertain|ment.</P>
<P>Metcalf became now in great reque&s;t as a performer at Ripon a&s;&s;embly, which was re&s;orted to by many families of di&s;tinction, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Sir Walter Blacket of Newby, Sir John Wray, Sir R. Graham, 'Squire Rhodes, 'Squire Ai&s;laby of Studley, and many others. When he played alone,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
it was u&s;ual with him, after the a&s;&s;embly, to &s;et off for Harrogate or Knare&s;borough; but when he had an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, he remained all night at Ripon to keep him company, his partner being afraid to ride in the dark.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf worth fifteen pounds, (a larger &s;um than he ever before had to &s;pare) he made his favourite Mi&s;s Ben&s;on his trea|&s;urer; but as he had not yet begun to &s;pecu|late in the purcha&s;e of <HI>land,</HI> and a main of cocks being made in the neighbourhood, he became a party, and drawing his ca&s;h from the hands of his fair banker, he lo&s;t two-thirds of his whole fortune.&mdash;The remaining five pounds he laid on a hor&s;e which was to run at York a few days after; and though he had the good fortune to win the la&s;t wager, his general imprudence in this way produced a little &s;hyne&s;s from his &s;weetheart.</P>
<P>His competitor (not &s;u&s;pecting the inti|macy between Metcalf and the young lady) pu&s;hed his &s;uit bri&s;kly; and after a &s;hort time, banns were publi&s;hed in the churches of Knare&s;borough and Kirby-Overblow.&mdash;<PB N="61" REF="67">
Metcalf was much &s;urpri&s;ed, having long thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of her affection. He now began to believe that &s;he had laid more &s;tre&s;s on his late follies than he had been aware of, and the remembrance of them gave him exqui&s;ite pain, for he loved her tender|ly, and was re&s;trained from propo&s;ing mar|riage to her only by the doubts he had of being able to &s;upport her in the manner &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to. On the other hand, his pride made him di&s;dain to &s;hew that he was hurt, or to take any mea&s;ures to prevent the match. The publication of banns being complete, the wedding-day was appointed.&mdash;The &s;uppo&s;ed bridegroom had provided an entertainment at his hou&s;e for upwards of two hundred people; and going with a few friends to Harrogate on the Sun|day, propo&s;ed the following day for the nuptials, which were to be &s;olemnized at Knare&s;borough, intending to return to Har|rogate to breakfa&s;t, where a bride-cake was ready, with a hamper of wine, which latter was to have been carried to Kirby, for the u&s;e of the gue&s;ts he had invited.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="68">On the Sunday, Metcalf riding pretty &s;martly pa&s;t the Royal Oak, towards the Queen's Head, was loudly acco&s;ted in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"One wants to &s;peak with you."</Q> He turned immediately to the &s;tables of the Oak, and, to his joyful &s;urpri&s;e, found there his favourite, who had &s;ent her mother's maid to call him. <Q REND="inline">"Well, la&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"thou's going to have a merry day to-mor|row; am I to be the fidler?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thou never &s;halt fiddle at my wedding,"</Q> replied &s;he. <Q REND="inline">"What's the matter?

plan, as Mi&s;s Ben&s;on was apprehen&s;ive of being mi&s;&s;ed by her friends.&mdash;Jack, ever prompt at an expedient, de&s;ired that &s;he would that night place a lighted candle in one of the windows of the old hou&s;e, as &s;oon as the coa&s;t was clear, and her&s;elf ready to &s;et off, which will doubtle&s;s appear to the reader a very extraordinary &s;ignal to a blind man; but he had conceived mea&s;ures for carrying the projected elopement into effect by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a third per&s;on. This being approved of, &s;he went into the hou&s;e, and in a &s;hort time was followed by Metcalf, who was warmly received by the &s;uppo&s;ed bridegroom and company. The tankard went bri&s;kly round with <Q REND="inline">"Succe&s;s to the intended couple;"</Q> in which toa&s;t, it may be readily believed, Metcalf joined them mo&s;t cordially.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed till it was near dark, he thought it time for putting bu&s;ine&s;s into a proper train. Going then to a public hou&s;e known by the name of the World's End, he inquired for the o&s;tler, whom he knew to be
<PB N="64" REF="70">
a &s;teady fellow; and after obtaining from this man a promi&s;e either to &s;erve him in an affair of moment in which he was engaged, or keep the &s;ecret, he related the particulars of his a&s;&s;ignation, and the intended elope|ment; to forward which, he de&s;ired him to let them have his ma&s;ter's mare, which he knew would carry double.&mdash;This agreed on, he reque&s;ted the further &s;ervice of meeting him at the Raffle Shop (now the Library) at ten o'clock: a whi&s;tle was to be given by the fir&s;t who got there, as a &s;ignal. They met pretty punctually; and Metcalf a&s;ked him if he &s;aw a &s;tar, meaning the light before mentioned: he &s;aid, he did not; but in le&s;s than half an hour the <HI>&s;tar</HI> was in the place appointed. They then left the hor&s;es at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, not choo&s;ing to venture into the court-yard, it being paved. On the door being opened by the lady, he a&s;ked her if &s;he was ready; to which &s;he replied in the affirmative.&mdash;He advi&s;ed her, however, to pack up a gown or two, as &s;he probably might not &s;ee her mother again for
<PB N="65" REF="71">
&s;ome time. The o&s;tler having recommended the lady's pillion to Metcalf, in preference to that of his mi&s;tre&s;s, he a&s;ked her for it:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O dear!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it is in the other hou&s;e; but we mu&s;t have it."</Q> She then went to the window and called up her &s;i&s;ter, who let her in. The pillion and cloth were in the room where the &s;uppo&s;ed bridegroom &s;lept; and on his &s;eeing her enter, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I'll take this and bru&s;h it, that it may be ready in the morning."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That's well thought on, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid he. She then came down, and all three went to the hor&s;es. Metcalf mounted her behind his friend, then got upon his own hor&s;e, and away they went. At that time it was not a matter of &s;o much difficulty to get married as it is at pre&s;ent; and they, with only the trouble of riding twelve miles, and at a &s;mall expence, were united.</P>
<P>Metcalf left his bride, on his return, at a friend's hou&s;e within five miles of Harrogate, but did not di&s;mount, being in ha&s;te to return the mare he had borrowed with <HI>French leave.</HI> A few minutes after their
<PB N="66" REF="72">
return, Mr. Body, the landlord, called for his mare, to go to Knare&s;borough, and fortunately &s;he was ready for him.</P>
<P>Metcalf now went to the Queen's Head, to perform the u&s;ual &s;ervice of playing during the breakfa&s;t half hour. His over|night's excur&s;ion made him rather thought|ful, having got a <HI>bird,</HI> but no <HI>cage</HI> for it. While he was mu&s;ing on this &s;ubject, an acquaintance, who made one of the intended bridegroom's company the evening before, came up, and a&s;ked him to take a gla&s;s with him. Metcalf quickly gue&s;&s;ed what his bu&s;i|ne&s;s was, but adjourned with him to a private room, &s;eemingly unconcerned. <Q REND="inline">"Metcalf,"</Q> &s;aid he <Q REND="inline">"a &s;trange thing has happened &s;ince you were with us la&s;t night, concerning Dolly Ben&s;on, who was to have been mar|ried this morning to Anthony Dickin&s;on.&mdash;You are &s;u&s;pected of knowing &s;omething about the former; and I &s;hall briefly &s;tate to you the con&s;ternation which her di&s;appear|ance has occa&s;ioned, and the rea&s;ons why &s;u&s;picion falls upon you. This morning, early, the bridegroom went to Knare&s;bo|rough,
<PB N="67" REF="73">
and informed the Rev. Mr. Collins that he and his intended wife were coming that forenoon to be married. In his ab&s;ence Mrs. Ben&s;on and her other daughter began to prepare for breakfa&s;t; and ob&s;erving that Dolly lay very long in bed, her mother de&s;ired that &s;he might be called; but her u&s;ual bedfellow declaring that &s;he had not &s;lept with her, &s;he was ordered to &s;eek her in &s;ome of the other rooms. This was done, but in vain. They then took it for granted that &s;he had taken a ride with Mr. Dickin|&s;on; but he returning, could give no account of her. All her friends began now to be very &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed; and, among&s;t other fearful conjectures, &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he might have fallen into the well, in attempting to draw water for breakfa&s;t; and actually got &s;ome iron creepers, and &s;earched the well. Her brother then took hor&s;e, and rode to Burton-Leonard, to a young man who had &s;lightly paid his addre&s;&s;es to her, and, inform|ing him of the di&s;tre&s;s of the family, begged he would give information, if in his power. The young man immediately a&s;ked him if he
<PB N="68" REF="74">
had &s;een Blind Jack; he an&s;wered, that you were at the Oak la&s;t night, but did not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect you.&mdash;The other, however, per&s;i&s;ted in the opinion that you were mo&s;t likely to know where the girl was, and gave the following incident as a rea&s;on: Being, not long &s;ince, at a dance, where Mi&s;s Ben|&s;on made one, he ob&s;erved her wiping a profu&s;e per&s;piration from your face, with an handkerchief; and this act was accompanied by a look &s;o tender, as left no doubt in his mind of her being &s;trongly attached to you."</Q></P>
<P>This narrative (a part of which was no news to Metcalf) was &s;carcely fini&s;hed, when young Ben&s;on appeared; and Metcalf put an end to all inquiry, by declaring the truth: and thinking it his duty to conciliate, if po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e whom he had offended, he employed the &s;ofte&s;t phra&s;es he was ma&s;ter of on the occa&s;ion. He begged pardon, through their &s;on, of Mr. and Mrs. Ben&s;on, whom he did not pre&s;ume to call father and mother, and wi&s;hed them to believe that the warmth of his pa&s;&s;ion for their daughter, with the de&s;pair of obtaining their con&s;ent,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
had led him to the mea&s;ures he had taken; and that he would make them the be&s;t amends in his power, by the affectionate conduct he &s;hould ob&s;erve to his wife.</P>
<P>The &s;on, in part pacified, left Metcalf, and reported this declaration to his parents: but they were ju&s;t as well plea&s;ed at it, as they would have been at the &s;ight of their build|ing in flames; and, in the height of pa&s;&s;ion, declared they would put him to death, if they met with him.</P>
<P>The poor forlorn Dickin&s;on then departed, accompanied by one of Mr. Ben&s;on's &s;ons. When they got near his home, they heard two &s;ets of bells, viz. tho&s;e of Folifoot and Kirby Overblow, ringing, in expectation of the arrival of the bride and groom; but the &s;ound was more like that of a knell to Dickin|&s;on, who fell from his hor&s;e through angui&s;h, but was relieved by the attention of his friend. The company were &s;urpri&s;ed at not &s;eeing the bride; but matters were &s;oon explained, and they were de&s;ired to partake of the fare pro|vided for them.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">Metcalf not being able, at once, to pro|cure a <HI>Palace</HI> for his <HI>Queen,</HI> took a &s;mall hou&s;e at Knare&s;borough. It now became matter of wonder that &s;he &s;hould have pre|ferred a blind man to Dickin&s;on, &s;he being as hand&s;ome a woman as any in the country. A lady having a&s;ked her why &s;he had refu&s;ed &s;o many good offers for Blind Jack; &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I could not be happy without him:"</Q> And being more particularly que&s;tioned, &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"His actions are &s;o &s;ingular, and his &s;pirit &s;o manly and enter|pri&s;ing, that I could not help liking him."</Q> Metcalf being interrogated, on his part, how he had contrived to obtain the lady, replied, That many women were like liquor-mer|chants, who purcha&s;e &s;pirits above proof, knowing that they can <HI>lower</HI> them at home; and this, he thought, would account why many a rake got a wife, while your plodding &s;ons of phlegm were doomed to celibacy.</P>
<P>He now went to Harrogate, as u&s;ual, with the exception of <HI>one</HI> hou&s;e. Meeting with a butcher there one day, and drinking pretty
<PB N="71" REF="77">
freely, a wager was propo&s;ed to Metcalf, that he dur&s;t not vi&s;it his mother-in-law. He took the wager, mounted his hor&s;e, and riding up to the kitchen-door, called for a pint of wine. There being then only women in the hou&s;e, they all ran up &s;tairs in a fright. He then rode into the kitchen, through the hou&s;e, and out at the hall-door, no one mole&s;ting him. As there were many evi|dences to this act of <HI>heroi&s;m,</HI> he returned, and demanding the &s;takes, received them without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Harrogate &s;ea&s;on being on the decline, he retired to Knare&s;borough, where he pur|cha&s;ed an old hou&s;e, intending to build on its &s;cite the next &s;ummer. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by ano|ther &s;tout man, he began to get &s;tones up from the river; and being much u&s;ed to the water, took great delight in this &s;ort of work. Meeting with &s;ome workmen, he told them the intended dimen&s;ions of his hou&s;e, and they named a price, by the rood, for build|ing it: but Metcalf, calculating from his own head, found that their e&s;timate would
<PB N="72" REF="78">
not do; &s;o letting them the job by lump agreement, they completed it at about half the &s;um which they would have got by the rood.</P>
<P>He now went to the Oak, to demand his wife's cloaths, but was refu&s;ed: on a &s;econd application, however, he &s;ucceeded. His wife having brought him a boy, and &s;ome genteel people being the &s;pon&s;ors, they em|ployed their good offices to heal the breach between the families, and were &s;o fortunate as to &s;ucceed. On the birth of a daughter (the &s;econd child) Mrs. Ben&s;on her&s;elf was godmother, and pre&s;ented Metcalf with fifty guineas.</P>
<P>He continued to play at Harrogate in the &s;ea&s;on; and &s;et up a four-wheel chai&s;e, and a one-hor&s;e chair, for public accommodation, there having been nothing of the kind there before.&mdash;He kept tho&s;e vehicles two &s;um|mers, when the innkeepers beginning to run chai&s;es, he gave them up; as he al&s;o did racing, and hunting; but &s;till wanting em|ployment, he bought hor&s;es, and went to
<PB N="73" REF="79">
the coa&s;t for fi&s;h, which he took to Leeds and Manche&s;ter; and &s;o inde&s;atigable was he, that he would frequently walk for two nights and a day, with little or no re&s;t.</P>
<P>Going from Knare&s;borough to Leeds in a &s;now-&s;torm, and cro&s;&s;ing a brook, the ice gave way under one of his hor&s;es, and he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of unloading to get him out; but the hor&s;e as &s;oon as free ran back to Knare&s;borough, leaving him with two pan|niers of fi&s;h, and three other loaded hor&s;es, which, together with the badne&s;s of the night, greatly perplexed him:&mdash;After much difficulty, however, he divided the weight among&s;t the others, and pur&s;uing his journey, arrived at Leeds by break of day.</P>
<P>Once pa&s;&s;ing through Halifax, he &s;topped at an inn called the Broad Stone. The land|lord's &s;on and &s;ome others who frequented Harrogate &s;eeing Metcalf come in, and hav|ing often heard of his exploits, &s;ignified a wi&s;h to play at cards with him: he agreed, and accordingly they &s;ent for a pack, which he de&s;ired to examine a little. The man of
<PB N="74" REF="80">
the hou&s;e being his friend, he could depend upon his honour in preventing deception. They began, and Metcalf beat four of them in turn; playing for liquor only. Not &s;ati&s;|fied with this, &s;ome of the company propo&s;ed playing for money; when engaging at &s;hil|ling whi&s;t, Metcalf won fifteen &s;hillings. The party who lo&s;t then propo&s;ed to play double or quit, but Metcalf declined playing for more than &s;hilling points; till at la&s;t yielding to much importunity, he got en|gaged for guineas, and, favoured by fortune, won ten, the whole &s;um late in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lo&s;er, who took up the cards, and going out, &s;oon returned with eight guineas more: Metcalf's friend examined the cards, to &s;ee that they were not marked; and find|ing all fair, they went on again, until tho&s;e eight pieces followed the other ten. They then drank freely at Metcalf's co&s;t, he being in good circum&s;tances to treat. About ten at night he took his leave, &s;aying he mu&s;t be at Knare&s;borough in the morning, having &s;ent his hor&s;es before. On his way he cro&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="81">
the river Wharfe about a mile below Poole: the water being high, his hor&s;e &s;wam, but he got &s;afe home; and this ended his pur&s;uits as a fi&s;hmonger, the profits being &s;mall, and his fatigue very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>From the period of his di&s;continuing the bu&s;ine&s;s of fi&s;hmonger, Metcalf continued in the practice of attending Harrogate, as a player on the violin in the Long-room, until the commencement of the Rebellion in 1745.</P>
<P>The events of that period having been &s;o numerou&s;ly and &s;o minutely detailed, that any one the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of this country cannot be unacquainted with the origin, progre&s;s, and termination of the civil commotions which agitated it,&mdash;it would appear unnece&s;&s;ary to obtrude the narration of them here, further than may &s;eem needful to introduce the part in which Metcalf bore a per&s;onal &s;hare. The circum&s;tance of his commencing &s;oldier, was at that time, and will &s;till by the reader, be looked upon as a very extraordinary proceeding of one in his &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82">The alarm which took place, in con&s;e|quence of that event, was general; and loyalty to the reigning Sovereign, and Government, with mea&s;ures for re&s;i&s;tance to the Rebel Party, &s;hone no where more con&s;picuous than in the County of York.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the many in&s;tances which mark this, none were more &s;triking than the &s;ig|nally-gallant conduct of the late WILLIAM THORNTON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Thornville.</P>
<P>The opinion of that gentleman, as deli|vered at the General County Meeting held at the Ca&s;tle of York, was, that the four thou|&s;and men, (for the rai&s;ing, cloathing, and maintaining of which <HI>ninety thou&s;and pounds</HI> had been &s;ub&s;cribed) &s;hould be embodied in companies with the regulars, and march with the King's forces to any part where their &s;ervices might be required.&mdash;This mode of proceeding, however, not meeting the opi|nion of the majority of the gentlemen pre&s;ent, he determined to rai&s;e a company at his own expence.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">In con&s;equence of that re&s;olution, Mr. Thornton went to Knare&s;borough about the fir&s;t of October, 1745; and Metcalf having for &s;everal years been in the practice of vi&s;it|ing that gentleman's man&s;ion, (particularly at the fe&s;tive &s;ea&s;on of Chri&s;tmas, where, with his violin and hautboy, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to entertain the family) Mr. Thornton was well acquainted with his extraordinary di&s;po&s;ition, and, imagining that he might be of &s;ervice to him in his pre&s;ent undertaking, &s;ent for our blind hero to his inn, treated him liberally with punch, and, informing him <Q REND="inline">"that the French were coming to join the Scotch rebels, the con&s;equence of which would be, that if not vigourou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, they would violate all our wives, daughters, and &s;i&s;ters,"</Q> a&s;ked him if he had &s;pirit to join the company about to be rai&s;ed. Metcalf in&s;tantly giving an affirmative an&s;wer, was a&s;ked whether he knew of any &s;pirited fellows who were likely to make good &s;oldiers; and having &s;atisfied his patron on this head al&s;o, he was appointed an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to a &s;erjeant already procured,
<PB N="78" REF="84">
with orders to begin recruiting the next day. This &s;ervice went on with rapid &s;uc|ce&s;s: &s;everal carpenters, &s;miths, and other artificers were engaged, to all of whom Metcalf promi&s;ed great military advance|ment, or, in default of that, places of va&s;t profit under Government, as &s;oon as the matter was over, which he called only a <HI>bu&s;tle;</HI> thus following the example of other <HI>decoy ducks,</HI> by promi&s;ing very unlikely things.</P>
<P>Such was their &s;ucce&s;s, that in two days only they enli&s;ted one hundred and forty men, out of whom the Captain drafted &s;ixty-four, (the number of privates he wanted) and &s;ent immediately to Leeds for cloth of a good quality for their cloathing. The coats were blue, trimmed and faced with buff; and buff wai&s;tcoats. The taylors he had employed refu&s;ing to work on a Sunday, he rebuked their fanatical &s;cruples in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"You ra&s;cals! if your hou&s;es were on fire, would you not be glad to extingui&s;h the flames on a <HI>Sunday?</HI>"</Q> which had the
<PB N="79" REF="85">
de&s;ired effect. Arms being procured from the Tower, the men were con&s;tantly and regularly drilled. Such of them as had relations in the public line, would frequently bring their companions to drink, for the benefit of the re&s;pective hou&s;es; and Metcalf never failed to attend one or other of tho&s;e parties, his fiddle and hautboy contributing to make the time pa&s;s agreeably: and the worthy Captain was liberal in his allowance of money for &s;uch fe&s;tive purpo&s;es, in&s;omuch that had he wanted five hundred men, he could ea&s;ily have obtained them. Soon after he brought them to Thornville, where he ordered every other day a fat ox to be killed for their entertainment, and gave them beer &s;even years old, expre&s;&s;ing a great plea&s;ure at its being re&s;erved for &s;o good a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He now began to found the company as to their attachment to the cau&s;e and to him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"My lads,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you are going to form a part of a ring-fence to the fine&s;t e&s;tate in the world! The King's army is on its march to the Northward; and I have
<PB N="80" REF="86">
the plea&s;ing confidence that all of you are willing to join them."</Q>&mdash;They replied, as if one &s;oul had animated them, <Q REND="inline">"We will follow you to the world's end!"</Q></P>
<P>All matters being adju&s;ted, the company was drawn up, and among&s;t them BLIND JACK made no <HI>&s;mall</HI> figure, being near &s;ix feet two inches high, and, like his compa|nions, dre&s;&s;ed in blue and buff, with a large gold-laced hat: So well plea&s;ed was the Captain with his appearance, that he &s;aid he would give an hundred guineas for only <HI>one eye</HI> to &s;tick in the head of his <HI>dark</HI> champion.</P>
<P>Jack now played a march of the Captain's choo&s;ing, and off they moved for Borough|bridge. Capt. Thornton having a di&s;cretion|ary route, took his march over the moors, in expectation of meeting &s;ome of the &s;traggling parties of the rebel army; and quartered at &s;everal villages in his way, where he was kindly received, and vi&s;ited by the heads of the genteele&s;t families in the neighbourhood, who generally &s;pent the evenings with him. Metcalf being always at the Captain's quar|ters,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
played on the violin, accompanied by a good voice, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Britons! &s;trike home,</HI>"</Q> and other loyal and popular airs, much to the &s;atisfaction of the vi&s;itors, who frequently offered him money, but this he always re|fu&s;ed, knowing that his acceptance of it would di&s;plea&s;e his commander.</P>
<P>Arriving at Newca&s;tle, they joined the army under the command of General Wade, by who&s;e order they were united with Pulte|ney's regiment, which, having &s;uffered much in &s;ome late actions abroad, was thought the weake&s;t. Captain Thornton gave orders for tents for his men, and a marquee for him&s;elf, for which he paid the uphol&s;terer eighty guineas. He pitched them on New|ca&s;tle Moor, and gave a pair of blankets to each tent. Jack ob&s;erved to his Captain, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I live next door to you: but it is a cu&s;tom, on coming to a new hou&s;e, to have it warmed."</Q> The Captain knowing his meaning, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How much will do?"</Q>&mdash;Jack an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Three &s;hillings a tent;"</Q> which the Captain generou&s;ly gave, and &s;aid,
<PB N="82" REF="88">
<Q REND="inline">"As you join Pulteney's regiment, they will &s;mell your breath;"</Q> &s;o he gave them ten guineas, being one to each company. On the night of their entertainment, the &s;now fell &s;ix inches.</P>
<P>After &s;topping here for about a week, the General received intelligence of the motions of the rebels, and gave orders to march by break of day for Hexham, in three columns, wi&s;hing to intercept them upon the We&s;t road, as their route &s;eemed to be for England that way. The tents were in&s;tantly &s;truck; but the Swi&s;s troops having the van, and not being willing to move at &s;o early an hour, it was half pa&s;t ten before they left the ground, and the &s;now by that time was become extremely deep in &s;everal places: it al&s;o proved a very &s;evere day for hail and fro&s;t. They were often three or four hours in marching a mile, the pioneers having to lower the hills, and fill up &s;everal ditches, to make a pa&s;&s;age for the artillery and baggage.</P>
<P>About ten at night they arrived at Oving|ton, the place marked out for them, with
<PB N="83" REF="89">
&s;traw to re&s;t on; but the ground was frozen &s;o hard, that but few of the tent-pins would enter it, and in tho&s;e few tents which were pitched, the men lay one upon another, greatly fatigued with their march, it having been fifteen hours from the time of their &s;triking the tents, till their arrival at this place, although the di&s;tance is only &s;even miles.</P>
<P>At eleven o'clock at night Captain Thorn|ton left the camp, and went to Hexham, to vi&s;it his relation, Sir Edward Blacket, and with a view of getting provi&s;ions and nece&s;|&s;aries for his men: he was only nine hours ab&s;ent, as, although it was Sunday morning, the march was to be continued. It having been cu&s;tomary to burn the &s;traw, to warm the men before they &s;et off, orders were here given to pre&s;erve it, in ca&s;e it might be wanted on their return. However, Captain Thornton and the Lieutenant being ab&s;ent, and the En&s;ign having died at Newca&s;tle, Metcalf took it upon him to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"My lads, get the &s;traw together, to burn; our Captain
<PB N="84" REF="90">
will pay for more, if we &s;hould want it:"</Q> which being done, he took out his fiddle, notwith&s;tanding the day, and played to the men whil&s;t they danced round the fire; which made the re&s;t of the army ob&s;erve them, though they did not follow their example. The Captain and Lieutenant ar|riving in the mid&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed much plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing the men thus recreate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>That day they reached Hexham, where they halted. On Monday night, about ten o'clock, the army was put in motion by a fal&s;e alarm. Here General Wade re&s;olved to return; and immediately began the march for York, by way of Pier&s;ebridge, Catterick, and Boroughbridge; and continuing his route Southward, encamped his men on Clifford Moor, where they halted a few days, and then moved to a ground between Ferry|bridge and Knottingley. The rebels had now penetrated Southward as far as Derby; but the General having heard that they had received a check from the Duke of Cumber|land,

&s;ent General Oglethorpe with a thou|&s;and hor&s;e towards Manche&s;ter, either to harra&s;s the enemy in their retreat, or to join the Duke's forces; and returned him&s;elf with the remainder, by Wakefield-Outwood, and Leeds, to Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke came up with the rebels at Clifton, on the borders of We&s;tmoreland, of which Lord George Mur|ray, with the rear guard, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t another party had fortified them&s;elves behind three hedges and a ditch.</P>
<P>The Duke coming upon the open moor after &s;un-&s;et, gave orders for three hundred dragoons to di&s;mount, and advance to the brink of the ditch; when the rebels fired upon them from behind the hedges, which they returned, and fell a few paces back: the rebels mi&s;taking this for flight, ru&s;hed over the ditch, but meeting a warmer recep|tion than they expected, were glad to retreat, and continued their route to Penrith.</P>
<P>The Duke's army was not able to follow, owing to the badne&s;s of the roads, and the
<PB N="86" REF="92">
fatigue of a tedious march; but the next morning he pur&s;ued them to Penrith; and from thence to Carli&s;le, where they left part of their army.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s thought it advi&s;able to reduce this place, and accordingly &s;ent for heavy artillery from Whitehaven, which ar|riving on the 25th of December, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered on the 30th, and his Royal Highne&s;s returned to London. General Wade continued his march for the North, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all the foreigners from his army; and General Hawley on coming from London to take the command, was joined by &s;ome regiments which had been withdrawn from Flanders. They marched to Edinburgh; from thence to Falkirk, and pitched their tents on the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, on the 16th of January.</P>
<P>The Highland army being at Torwood, about mid-way between Falkirk and Stirling, and di&s;tant from the Engli&s;h camp only about three miles, they could ea&s;ily di&s;cover each other's camp-lights. The Engli&s;h army lay
<PB N="87" REF="93">
all night on their arms, in expectation of being attacked; but the van and picquet guards came in on the morning of the 17th, having ob&s;erved no motions in the rebel camp which &s;hewed any &s;igns of an attack, although they were as near them as &s;afety would permit. Soon after, the enemy were ob&s;erved to move &s;ome of their colours from Torwood, towards Stirling, which made the Engli&s;h &s;uppo&s;e that they were retreating; but this motion was a feint to deceive them. However, upon this appearance, the &s;oldiers were ordered to pile their arms, and take &s;ome refre&s;hment; and although Lord Kil|marnock was in the rebel army, General Hawley went to breakfa&s;t with Lady Kilmar|nock, at Callendar-Hou&s;e. The enemy, in the mean time, &s;tole a march down a valley Northward, unperceived; but ju&s;t before the army di&s;covered them, they were &s;een by a per&s;on who ran into the camp, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen! what are you about? the Highlanders will be upon you:"</Q> on which &s;ome of the officers &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Seize that ra&s;cal,
<PB N="88" REF="94">
he is &s;preading a fal&s;e alarm."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Will you, then, believe your own eyes?"</Q> replied the man; when in&s;tantly the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion became apparent, by their advancing to the highe&s;t ground upon Falkirk moor, the wind blowing &s;trongly in the faces of the Engli&s;h, with a &s;evere rain. At this moment &s;everal had left the field as well as the General; but the drums beat to arms, which cau&s;ed tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent to repair in&s;tantly to the camp, and the lines were immediately formed.</P>
<P>Captain Thornton's company was embo|died with the matro&s;&s;es, who were thought too weak; and this was a great di&s;appoint|ment to him, who&s;e intention was to be in the front, whenever an engagement &s;hould take place. Metcalf played before them to the field; but the flag cannon &s;inking in a bog, Captain Thornton exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"D&mdash;n this accident; we &s;hall &s;ee no &s;port to-day:"</Q> and leaving his troop to a&s;&s;i&s;t the matro&s;&s;es in bringing up the cannon to their &s;tation, he rode up oppo&s;ite to the hor&s;e which were
<PB N="89" REF="95">
going to engage. The regiments of Hamil|ton and Gardner were put in the front; and the Highlanders, after firing their pieces, threw them down, and di&s;charged their pi&s;tols in the hor&s;es' faces, which cau&s;ed them to retreat, much confu&s;ed: and on the Duke of Perth exclaiming aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Although the hor&s;e have given way, yet the work is not accom|pli&s;hed,"</Q> the enemy pur&s;ued with their broad &s;words, cutting down the men as they fled; and the hor&s;es did great mi&s;chief, by break|ing through their own foot, the men crying out at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline">"Dear brethren, we &s;hall all be ma&s;&s;acred this day!"</Q> On their pa&s;&s;ing the artillery, the Captain of the ma|tre&s;&s;es &s;eeing their perilous &s;ituation, gave orders for all the train hor&s;es to be cut from the cannon. General Hu&s;ke at this time came up with three regiments, and engaged the left wing of the Highlanders, ordering the rear and centre to keep firing, and the front to re&s;erve. The rebels, as was their cu&s;tom, after the di&s;charge of their pieces, flung them away, and advanced with their
<PB N="90" REF="96">
broad &s;words clo&s;e up to the fir&s;t line; when the front in&s;tantly fired, and being &s;o near, did more than double execution; which cau&s;ed them to retreat, leaving a great num|ber dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The General ob&s;erving a va&s;t body of the rebels on the right, drew up his men nearer Falkirk, and gave orders to keep the town until morning: however, on examining the powder, they had the mortification to find that the heavy rains had damaged it to &s;uch a degree, that but few pieces could be fired; and the village being open on all &s;ides, was a circum&s;tance &s;o favourable to the enemy, as induced that General to form the re&s;olu|tion of quitting the town with all expedition, and march to Linlithgow, where there was more &s;helter under the walls, in ca&s;e of an attack.&mdash;This mea&s;ure was fully ju&s;tified by the event; for the enemy pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;ely, that many were taken by &s;urpri&s;e, as, in con&s;equence of the order to keep the town all night, &s;everal had gone into the hou&s;es to put off their wet cloathes; and tho&s;e who
<PB N="91" REF="97">
were appri&s;ed of the retreat had no &s;ooner left the place, than the rebels took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and made a great many pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom were twenty of Captain Thornton's men, with the Lieutenant and En&s;ign.</P>
<P>Mr. Crofts, the Lieutenant, having eighty guineas in his pocket, begged to make Lord George Murray his trea&s;urer; which office his Lord&s;hip accepted, and had afterwards the <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> to return him SIX!</P>
<P>Captain Thornton, al&s;o, was in one of the hou&s;es, for the purpo&s;e before-mentioned, but had not time &s;ufficient to effect his e&s;cape; and being alarmed by the bagpipes at the door, he retreated up &s;tairs: in a few minutes &s;everal of the rebels ru&s;hed up, in &s;earch of the fugitives; when one of them came to the very room door behind which he had taken refuge, and overlooking him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here are none of the ra&s;cals here."</Q> The woman of the hou&s;e having &s;een the Captain go up &s;tairs, went to him &s;oon after, and opening a clo&s;et door, entreated him to enter, which he did.&mdash;She then brought
<PB N="92" REF="98">
a dre&s;&s;er, and placed di&s;hes, &amp;c. upon it, which prevented all appearance of a door in that place; and fortunately there was no bed in the room. About ten minutes after he had been fixed in his new quarters, a great number of people, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of High|land officers, among&s;t whom was Secretary Murray, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the apartment, which being large, they propo&s;ed making u&s;e of for bu&s;ine&s;s during their &s;tay.</P>
<P>We will there leave Captain Thornton, and return to Metcalf, who with the matro&s;|&s;es was retiring from the field of battle.</P>
<P>Knowing that two of his ma&s;ter's hor&s;es had been left at a widow's hou&s;e a &s;hort di&s;tance from the town, he made his way to the place, with intent to &s;ecure them. This woman had in the morning expre&s;&s;ed great &s;eeming loyalty to King George; but when Metcalf returned in the evening, the wind had changed:&mdash;She now extolled Prince Charles, and &s;aid the de&s;eat of <HI>George's folk</HI> was a ju&s;t judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="99">Metcalf went into the &s;table and found the hor&s;es, &s;addled them, and was leading out the fir&s;t, when he was &s;urrounded by a few &s;tragglers of the Highland army: <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t have that bea&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid they; but Metcalf refu&s;ing to give him up, they &s;aid to one another, <Q REND="inline">"Shoot him."</Q> On hearing two of them cock their pieces, he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"What do you want with him?"</Q>&mdash;They an&s;wered, that they wanted him for their Prince: <Q REND="inline">"If &s;o, you mu&s;t have him,"</Q> replied he. They took him, and immediately went off. Met|calf then brought out the other; but as he was about to mount, the Captain's coach|man (who&s;e name was Snowden) joined him, and Metcalf inquiring of him the fate of his ma&s;ter, was an&s;wered, that he had not &s;een him &s;ince he left the artillery, when he rode up with the hor&s;e which were going to engage: this induced them to think that the wor&s;t had befallen him. They then thought it advi&s;able to attempt falling in with the rear of the army, and endeavoured to &s;lant the ground for that purpo&s;e; but before they
<PB N="94" REF="100">
had proceeded many yards, their hor&s;e &s;unk up to the &s;addle-&s;kirts in a bog: however, being &s;trong and plunging out, they mounted again, and &s;oon joined it as they wi&s;hed; where on making diligent inquiry after their Captain, they were told that he was left behind; on which Snowden returned as far as he could with &s;afety, but without gaining any intelligence, and Metcalf walked on with the army.</P>
<P>They arrived at Linlithgow, where they halted; and the next day they marched to Edinburgh. There the mob, and lower orders of people, were very free in their expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome of the higher al&s;o &s;poke very warmly, in favour of Prince Charles; making it appear clearly, <HI>by their own account,</HI> that nothing could prevent his coming to the Crown.</P>
<P>The next morning as many of Captain Thornton's men as had e&s;caped being taken pri&s;oners, (about forty-eight in number,) a&s;&s;embled; and none of them being quite certain of having &s;een the Captain &s;ince he
<PB N="95" REF="101">
left them with the cannon in the bog, they &s;uppo&s;ed him to have &s;hared the fate of many other brave men who had fallen in the action of that day, and which they all &s;in|cerely lamented&mdash;not only on account of the favours he had individually conferred on them, but for the great and liberal example which he had invariably &s;hewn to his brother officers, in the care and attention which he paid to his men in general; the natural con|&s;equence of which was, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the love and confidence of the &s;oldiery. The di&s;appearance, al&s;o, of the two other officers, and twenty of their men, greatly di&s;pirited them; and, together with the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from their regular pay, induced &s;ome of them to apply to Metcalf for a &s;upply, in order to carry them home; but he laudably refu&s;ed any aid he might have afforded them, on being informed of the purpo&s;e for which it was required.</P>
<P>The army being fixed at Edinburgh, the head-quarters were at the Abbey. The &s;uperior officers &s;ent for Metcalf, thinking it
<PB N="96" REF="102">
a &s;ingular circum&s;tance that a per&s;on de|prived of &s;ight &s;hould enter into the army; and knowing that his ma&s;ter was mi&s;&s;ing, they de&s;ired to conver&s;e with him. One of the officers belonging to the dragoons who retreated from Falkirk &s;peaking ironically of Thornton's men, a&s;ked Jack how <HI>he</HI> got off the field of battle.&mdash;Metcalf an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I found it very ea&s;y to follow by the &s;ound of the dragoon hor&s;es, they made &s;uch a <HI>clatter</HI> over the &s;tones."</Q> This reply made the gen|tlemen turn the laugh again&s;t him. Colonel Cockayne likewi&s;e a&s;ked how he dur&s;t venture into the &s;ervice, blind as he was; to which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"that had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pair of good eyes, he would never have come there to have ri&s;ked the lo&s;s of them by gun|powder."</Q> Then making his obei&s;ance, he withdrew: For Metcalf, though he had not <HI>read books,</HI> had read <HI>men;</HI> and received his knowledge from the &s;chool of the world.</P>
<P>He now determined upon a journey to Falkirk, in &s;earch of his Captain; but this being attended with difficulty, he applied to a
<PB N="97" REF="103">
Knare&s;borough man who lived at Edinburgh and was of the rebel party, telling him that he wi&s;hed to be a mu&s;ician to Prince Charles, as he found it was all over with the Engli&s;h. The man informed him that they had a &s;py, an Iri&s;hman, going to the Prince; on which Metcalf &s;et forward with him, and he pro|mi&s;ed to recommend him on their arrival at Falkirk; but on coming up to the Engli&s;h out-&s;entries, they were &s;topped:&mdash;Metcalf inquired for the Captain, and informed him of the real cau&s;e of his journey: by him he was kindly advi&s;ed to lay a&s;ide his project, and told that he would lo&s;e his life; but &s;till per&s;i&s;ting, he proceeded with the &s;py, and arrived at Linlithgow, where they &s;tayed all night. They met with &s;everal women who had been upon plunder, and were then on their return to Edinburgh; and the &s;py in&s;tructed them how to avoid the Engli&s;h &s;entries. Metcalf was very careful to exa|mine the cloathes they had got, thinking that by chance he might meet with &s;ome of his Captain's, ignorant as he was of his fate.
<PB N="98" REF="104">
One of the women &s;ent a token by Metcalf to her hu&s;band, who was Lord George Murray's cook: this woman's guide was a hor&s;e-dealer, who &s;oon became acquainted with Metcalf, having frequented the fairs in York&s;hire; and at this time by &s;ome means had got introduced to the heads of both armies, and obtained a protection from each to pre&s;s hor&s;es occa&s;ionally.&mdash;This man's fate was re|markable; for going into Stirling, where the King's army lay, he found that orders were given to let no &s;trangers pa&s;s without an examination, which he underwent, and &s;aid that he had a protection from General Hu&s;ke: being ordered to produce it, he had the mi&s;|fortune to take that out of his pocket which he had got from the Pretender; and when informed of his mi&s;take, in&s;tantly produced the other&mdash;but too late; for he was tied up by the neck to a lamp-iron, without giving him time to put off his boots.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before Metcalf and the &s;py left the 'Change-hou&s;e at Linlithgow, &s;ome of the van guard of the rebels came in, and
<PB N="99" REF="105">
called for whi&s;key; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that they dropped there a &s;ilver-mounted pi&s;tol, which, on their &s;etting out, the &s;py picked up, and offered to Metcalf; but he refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, he thought it not proper to have fire-arms about him, as he expected to be &s;earched: &s;o they pur&s;ued their journey and pre&s;ently fell in with the rebels out|guard, &s;everal of whom acco&s;ted Metcalf, and as all &s;eemed well, they were allowed to pa&s;s, and arrived at Falkirk, where he inquired for Lord George Murray's cook, to deliver his pre&s;ent, and was afterwards introduced to and conver&s;ed with his Lord|&s;hip, Secretary Murray, and other gentle|men. Lord George gave him part of a gla&s;s of wine, an article at that time of great value; for as the rebels had been there three times, and the Engli&s;h twice, they had almo&s;t <HI>&s;wept the cupboard clean of its crumbs.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t conver&s;ing with them, he was very circum&s;pect, knowing that his life was in danger, if the real purpo&s;e of his journey &s;hould be di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106">He then made his way towards the market-place, where a number of Highlanders were a&s;&s;embled.&mdash;This was on Wedne&s;day the 22d; but it happened that his ma&s;ter had left the place that morning, about four hours before his arrival.</P>
<P>We will now return to Captain Thornton, whom we left on Friday in the clo&s;et, in clo&s;e neighbourhood with the Highland Chiefs, who every day tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s in the room. The Quarter-Ma&s;ters of the rebel army hav|ing taken the hou&s;e, had given the woman to whom it belonged a &s;mall apartment back|ward; but every night &s;he took care to carry him &s;uch provi&s;ions as &s;he could convey through a crevice at the bottom of the door; and this mode &s;he u&s;ed for fear of alarming tho&s;e who &s;lept in the adjoining rooms. The clo&s;et was only a yard and a half &s;quare; and the Captain's cloathes being wet when he entered, made his &s;ituation the more uncom|fortable, as he had got a &s;evere cold, and &s;ometimes could not forbear coughing, even when the rebels were in their room. Once
<PB N="101" REF="107">
in particular, hearing a cough, they &s;aid one to another <Q REND="inline">"what is that?"</Q> but one of them an&s;wered, that it was &s;omebody in another room;&mdash;not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting a door in the place where the clo&s;et was.</P>
<P>On Monday night the woman of the hou&s;e went to the door to carry provi&s;ions as u&s;ual, when the Captain &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline">"I am deter|mined to come out, let the con&s;equence be what it may; for I will not die like a dog in this hole;"</Q> but &s;he begged that he would bear his confinement till the next night, and &s;he would adopt &s;ome plan to effect his e&s;cape. She accordingly con&s;ulted an old carpenter, who was true to the Royal cau&s;e, and he came the next night, removed the dre&s;&s;er, and liberated the Captain. They proceeded down &s;tairs in the dark, to the woman's apartment, where &s;he made tea, whil&s;t the carpenter concerted their plan of operation. They dre&s;&s;ed him in a pladdie and brogues, with a black wig, and the carpenter packed him up a bag of tools, as if he was going with his ma&s;ter to work as &s;oon as it was
<PB N="102" REF="108">
light. The Captain had only ten guineas about him, (having lo&s;t his ca&s;h with his Lieutenant, Mr. Crofts) eight of which he gave to the woman who had &s;o faithfully pre&s;erved him, and two to the carpenter, who, to &s;ecrete them, put them into his mouth along with his tobacco, fearful of a &s;earch by the Highlanders, who would have &s;u&s;pected him had they found more than a &s;hilling. Every thing being ready, they &s;et out, the Captain with his bag of tools follow|ing his &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter. On coming into the croud, he looked about, and was rather behind; and although in di&s;gui&s;e, did not look like a common workman;&mdash;which making the old man dread a di&s;covery, he called out to him, <Q REND="inline">"Come alang, ye filthy loon: ye have had half a bannock and a mutchkin of drink in your wame&mdash;we &s;hall be too late for our day's wark."</Q> Whether this artifice &s;erved him or not, is uncertain; but they got &s;afe through the throng, and, leaving the high-road, pur&s;ued their journey acro&s;s the country. Having come to a ri&s;ing
<PB N="103" REF="109">
ground, the Captain took a view of Falkirk moor, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Yonder's the place where &s;uch a &s;ad piece of work was made of it on Friday la&s;t."</Q> The old man at the &s;ame time looking the other way, &s;aw two or three hundred Highlanders, who had been on plunder, coming down a lane which led from Callendar-Hou&s;e (Lord Kilmarnock's &s;eat) into the main road; and being de&s;irous of pa&s;&s;ing the end of this lane before they came up, in order to avoid them, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall have a wor&s;e piece of work of it than we had on Friday, if you do not ha&s;ten your pace;"</Q> and begged the Captain to come forward, which he did; but walking bri&s;kly up a hill, he &s;uddenly &s;topped, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ick:"</Q> however they gained their point, and pa&s;&s;ed the Highlanders; for had they come up with them, the lea&s;t injury would have been a march back to Falkirk, as pri&s;oners. On going two miles farther, they arrived at a hou&s;e belonging to a friend of the carpenter's, and which had been plundered: there the old man got an egg, but not being able to
<PB N="104" REF="110">
find a pan to boil it, he roa&s;ted it in peat|a&s;hes, and gave it to the Captain, to put in his <HI>wame,</HI> for &s;o he called his &s;tomach. Proceeding a few miles farther, they arrived at another hou&s;e, where they procured a hor&s;e for the Captain.&mdash;He arrived at the Engli&s;h out-po&s;ts, and making him&s;elf known was permitted to pa&s;s, and reached Edin|burgh in &s;afety.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Metcalf, whom we left at Falkirk, as his dre&s;s was a plaid wai&s;tcoat laced with gold, which he had borrowed of a friend at Edinburgh, together with a blue regimental coat faced with buff, he told the Highlanders, in an&s;wer to their inquiries, that he had been fiddling for the Engli&s;h officers, and that they had given him that coat, which had belonged to a man who was killed; and al&s;o that his intention was to &s;erve in the &s;ame capacity with Prince Charles.&mdash;But a per&s;on coming up who had &s;een Jack at Harrogate, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That fellow ought to be taken up, for he has &s;omething more than common in his proceedings;"</Q> on
<PB N="105" REF="111">
which Metcalf was taken to the guard-room, and &s;earched for letters, but none were found, having only a pack of cards in his pocket, which they &s;plit, to &s;ee whether they contained any writing in the folds, but find|ing none, he was put into a loft in the roof of the building, (where the &s;now came in very much) along with a dragoon, and &s;ome other pri&s;oners, where for three days they were &s;uffered to remain in confinement.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time Metcalf and his fellow-pri&s;oners were tried by a court-martial, at which he was acquitted, and had permi&s;&s;ion given to go to the Prince; but wanting to borrow a clean &s;hirt, they a&s;ked him where his own were; he &s;aid, at Linlithgow, but that he dur&s;t not go there, on account of <HI>George's devils.</HI> They told him that he might &s;afely go with the Iri&s;hman he came with. He knew that his companion had letters for the Highlanders' friends at Edin|burgh, but had no intention to pa&s;s the En|gli&s;h &s;entries. Metcalf amu&s;ed him with a&s;&s;urances that he had ten pounds at Edin|burgh,
<PB N="106" REF="112">
for which he &s;hould have no occa|&s;ion if he joined the Prince, and that he might have the greate&s;t part of it: the &s;py, on this, became extremely de&s;irous of his company to Edinburgh, wi&s;hing to finger the money, and propo&s;ed going acro&s;s the coun|try; but Metcalf &s;aid that <HI>he</HI> could pa&s;s the Engli&s;h &s;entries, by &s;aying that he was going to Captain Thornton. They then proceeded, and after going two miles, they met an offi|cer, who was reconnoitring, and he knowing Metcalf, told him that his ma&s;ter was arrived at Edinburgh, which news was highly plea|&s;ing to him. On leaving the officer, the &s;py acco&s;ted him with <Q REND="inline">"So, what you <HI>are</HI> going to him."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid Metcalf, <Q REND="inline">"nor to any &s;uch fellows."</Q> They then pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entry, as Metcalf propo&s;ed, and arrived at Edinburgh, where they parted, but promi&s;ed to meet the next evening at nine o'clock. Jack went directly to his Captain, who re|joiced at &s;o unexpected a meeting. Metcalf told him that he had given him a great deal of trouble; adding, that he thought people
<PB N="107" REF="113">
might come home from market without fetching.&mdash;The Captain &s;miled, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What is to be done, for I have neither money or cloathes, having left all behind at Falkirk; but I have bills upon the road to the amount of three hundred pounds?"</Q> This proved fortunate; for had they been a few days &s;ooner, they might by chance have been lo&s;t al&s;o;&mdash;but the rea&s;on of this delay was, that all letters, directed to Scotland, were at this time &s;ent to London, to be examined at the General Po&s;t-Office. Metcalf told the Captain that he could get him &s;ome money, which the other thought impo&s;&s;ible: how|ever he went to a known friend, and ob|tained thirty pounds.&mdash;Taylors were in&s;tantly &s;et to work, and next morning the Captain was enabled to vi&s;it his brother officers at the Abbey.</P>
<P>The army &s;till quartered at Edinburgh, while part of the rebels were in Falkirk, and another part at Stirling, where they rai&s;ed &s;everal batteries, and be&s;ieged Stirling Ca&s;tle. The governor, General Blakeney, made little

oppo&s;ition; and a &s;hot from the batteries killing two or three men, &s;ome of the officers were greatly enraged, and threatened to confine the Governor: But a little time &s;hewed that he was right in his conduct; for letting the rebels come pretty near the walls, on a &s;udden he began &s;o hot a fire, as to kill &s;everal of their men, demoli&s;hing their batteries, and di&s;mounting their guns, which made them glad to retreat, and rai&s;e the &s;iege: and the General having de&s;troyed the bridge, they were obliged to make a circuit|ous march before they were able to ford the river.</P>
<P>The Duke of Cumberland arrived at Edin|burgh on the 30th of January, 1746; and two days afterwards marched out at the head of the army, towards Falkirk, the rebels leaving it a little time before. Captain Thornton vi&s;ited the Duke often: his Royal Highne&s;s took notice of Metcalf, and &s;poke to him &s;everal times on the march, ob&s;erving how well by the &s;ound of the drum he was able to keep his pace. On the army's arri|val
<PB N="109" REF="115">
at Linlithgow, intelligence was received that the rebels were on their march to give them battle; upon which the army was drawn up in order, and the Duke rode through the lines, and addre&s;&s;ed the men as follows: <Q REND="inline">"If there be any who think them|&s;elves in a bad cau&s;e, or are afraid to engage, thinking they may fight again&s;t any of their relations, let them now turn out, receive pardon, and go about their bu&s;ine&s;s, without any farther que&s;tion."</Q>&mdash;On this, the whole army gave three huzzas. But the intelli|gence proving fal&s;e, they proceeded to Fal|kirk, and continued their route through Stir|ling, Perth, Montro&s;e, Briffin, and Stonehive, to Aberdeen, where they halted. The rebel army lay now at Strathbogie.</P>
<P>At Aberdeen the Duke gave a ball to the ladies, and per&s;onally &s;olicited Captain Thorn|ton for his fidler, there being at that time no mu&s;ic in the army except Colonel Howard's, (the Old Buffs) and which being wind mu&s;ic were unaccu&s;tomed to country dances. As the rebel army was only twenty miles di&s;tant,
<PB N="110" REF="116">
no invitations were &s;ent till five o'clock, tho' the ball was to begin at &s;ix. Twenty-five couple danced for eight hours, and his Royal Highne&s;s made one of the &s;et, and &s;everal times, as he pa&s;&s;ed Metcalf, who &s;tood on a chair to play, &s;houted <Q REND="inline">"Thornton, play up:"</Q> but Jack needed no exhortation, for he was very well practi&s;ed, and better inclined.</P>
<P>Next morning the Duke &s;ent him two guineas; but as he was not permitted to take money, he informed his Captain, who &s;aid, that as it was the Duke's money, he might take it; but ob&s;erved, that he &s;hould give his Royal Highne&s;s's &s;ervants a treat. He had only three &s;ervants with him, (viz. his gentleman, cook, and groom.) So the next night two of them paid Metcalf a vi&s;it, and a merry party they made, the Captain ordering them great plenty of liquor.</P>
<P>In a little time they proceeded on their march, and engaged the rebels on Culloden moor, giving them a total defeat, although they had targets to ward off the bayonet, whil&s;t they cut away with their broad &s;words,
<PB N="111" REF="117">
yet the Duke found a method of fru&s;trating their plan, by pu&s;hing the bayonet over the right arm, which rendered their targets of no u&s;e. King&s;ton's Light Hor&s;e pur&s;ued them in their di&s;order and flight, and made a great &s;laughter among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h pri&s;oners were now all libe|rated.&mdash;Two or three of Captain Thornton's men had died in pri&s;on; and the re&s;t re|turned home.</P>
<P>The rebellion being completely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, Captain Thornton returned home al&s;o, ac|companied by Metcalf, of who&s;e family it is full time to take &s;ome notice.&mdash;He had the happine&s;s to find his faithful partner and children in good health; and although the former confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had entertained many fears for her poor blind adventurer, yet knowing that a &s;pirit of enterprize made a part of his nature, &s;he was often comforted by the hope, that he would, in &s;ome degree, &s;ignalize him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the misfor|tune under which he laboured.&mdash;This decla|ration, following a mo&s;t cordial reception,
<PB N="112" REF="118">
gave full confirmation to an opinion which Metcalf had ever held, viz. that the care&s;&s;es and approbation of the &s;ofter &s;ex, are the highe&s;t reward a &s;oldier can de&s;erve or obtain.</P>
<P>The notice with which the Duke of Cum|berland had honoured Metcalf, gave him much rea&s;on to believe, that, had he fol|lowed him to London, he would have re|ceived more marks of his Royal favour.&mdash;But Metcalf was deficient to him&s;elf in this in&s;tance; neglecting to &s;olicit further notice till it was judged too late to make application.</P>
<P>About a year after their return, a vacancy happening in the repre&s;entation for the city of York, the citizens &s;ent for Mr. Thornton, and unanimou&s;ly elected him, free of all expence.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this, the militia was rai&s;ed, and he was, as his merit well entitled him to be, appointed Colonel of the We&s;t-York battalion; which &s;ituation he held, with advantage to the &s;ervice, and honour to him&s;elf, for the remainder of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119">Blind Jack being now at liberty to choo&s;e his occupation, attended Harrogate as u&s;ual; but having, in the cour&s;e of his Scotch expe|dition, become acquainted with the various articles manufactured in that country, and judging that &s;ome of tho&s;e might an&s;wer for him to traffic with in England, he repaired, in the &s;pring, to Scotland, and &s;upplied him|&s;elf with various articles in the cotton and wor&s;ted way, particularly Aberdeen &s;tock|ings. For all tho&s;e articles he found a ready &s;ale at the hou&s;es of gentlemen in the exten|&s;ive County of York; and being per&s;onally known to mo&s;t of the families, was ever very kindly received. He never was at a lo&s;s to know, among&s;t a thou&s;and articles, what each had co&s;t him, from a particular mode of marking.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o cu&s;tomary with him to buy hor&s;es, for &s;ale in Scotland, bringing back galloways in return; and in this traffic he depended on feeling the animals, to direct his choice.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120">He al&s;o engaged pretty deeply in the con|traband trade, the profits of which were at that time much more con&s;iderable than the ri&s;k.</P>
<P>One time in particular, having received a pre&s;&s;ing letter from Newca&s;tle-upon-Tyne, requiring his &s;peedy attendance, he &s;et out on hor&s;eback from Knare&s;borough at three in the morning, and got into Newca&s;tle in the evening about &s;ix o'clock, the di&s;tance nearly &s;eventy-four miles, and did not feel the lea&s;t fatigued.</P>
<P>Having received &s;ome packages, he em|ployed a few &s;oldiers to convey them to a carrier, judging that men of their de&s;cription were lea&s;t liable to &s;u&s;picion. After &s;ending off his goods, he &s;tayed two nights with &s;ome relations he had there, and then &s;et off for home. He had with him about an hundred weight of tea, ca&s;ed over with tow, and tightly corded up; this he put into a wallet, which he laid acro&s;s his &s;addle.</P>
<P>Coming to Che&s;ter-le-Street, (about half|way between Newca&s;tle and Durham) he
<PB N="115" REF="121">
met at the inn an exci&s;eman, who knew him as &s;oon as he had di&s;mounted, and a&s;ked him what he had got there. Metcalf an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;ome tow and line for my aunt, who lives a few miles di&s;tant;&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;he was far enough for giving me the trouble to fetch it."</Q> The officer a&s;king him to bring it in, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"For the time I &s;hall &s;tay it may as well remain on the hor&s;ing-&s;tone."</Q> By this &s;eeming indifference about his package, he removed &s;u&s;picion from the mind of the exci&s;eman, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re-placing it acro&s;s the &s;addle; when he pur&s;ued his journey, and got home in &s;afety.</P>
<P>Once having di&s;po&s;ed of a &s;tring of hor&s;es, he bought, with the produce, a quantity of rum, brandy, and tea, to the amount of 200l. put them on board a ve&s;&s;el for Leith, and travelled over-land, on foot, to meet the ve&s;&s;el there. He had about thirty miles to walk, and carried near five &s;tone weight of goods which he did not choo&s;e to put on &s;hipboard. At Leith he had the mortifica|tion to wait &s;ix weeks, without receiving any
<PB N="116" REF="122">
tidings of the ve&s;&s;el, which many &s;uppo&s;ed to have been lo&s;t, there having been a &s;torm in the interval. The di&s;tre&s;s of mind re&s;ult|ing from this, induced him once to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"If &s;he is lo&s;t, I wi&s;h I had been in her; for &s;he had all my property on board."</Q> Soon after, however, the &s;hip got into Leith harbour. He there went on board, and &s;et &s;ail for Newca&s;tle; but another &s;torm ari&s;ing, the mate was wa&s;hed overboard, the mainfail carried away, and the &s;hip driven near the coa&s;t of Norway. De&s;pair now became general; the pro&s;pect of going to the bottom &s;eeming almo&s;t certain. He now reflected on the impiety of his wi&s;h re&s;pecting the former &s;torm; and &s;o effectually was his way of thinking changed, that had he had all the current coin of the univer&s;e, he would have given it to have been on &s;hore. It now appeared to him a dreadful thing to leave the world in the mid&s;t of health and vigour; but the wind changing, hope began to return, and the Captain put about for the Scotch coa&s;t, intending to make Arbrothie. A &s;ig|nal
<PB N="117" REF="123">
of di&s;tre&s;s was put up, but the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that no boat could venture out with a pilot. He then &s;tood in for the harbour, but &s;truck again&s;t the pier end, owing to the unmanageable &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;el, from the lo&s;s of her main&s;ail: &s;he narrowly e&s;caped being bulged; but having got to the back of the pier, was towed round into the har|bour, with near five feet water in her hold. Her e&s;cape from the mercile&s;s elements, however, did not &s;eem to terminate her dangers, the country people &s;hewing a di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;eize her as a wreck, and plunder her; but fortunately there was at hand a party, con&s;i&s;ting of an officer and twenty men, of Pulteney's regiment, who had been in pur&s;uit of &s;ome &s;mugglers; and Metcalf knowing them well, (Colonel Thornton's company being attached to that regiment) the officer &s;ent three files of men to protect the ve&s;&s;el, while the crew were removing the goods to a warehou&s;e.</P>
<P>As this ve&s;&s;el &s;tood in need of repairs, Metcalf put his goods on board another,
<PB N="118" REF="124">
and in her got to Newca&s;tle. There he met with an acquaintance; and from the &s;eem|ing cordiality at the meeting, he thought he might have tru&s;ted his life in the hands of this man. With this impre&s;&s;ion, Metcalf opened to him the &s;tate of his affairs; in|forming him that he had got four hundred gallons of gin and brandy, for which he had a permit, and about thirty gallons for which he had none, and which he wanted to land; telling him, at the &s;ame time, of the harra&s;s|ing voyage he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed: But, it &s;eems, his misfortunes were only about to commence; for, in a quarter of an hour, he found that the man whom he had taken for a friend had gone down to the quay &s;ide, and, giving information of what he knew, had all the goods &s;eized, and brought on &s;hore. Metcalf imagined that none were &s;eizable but the &s;mall part for which he had not obtained a permit; but was &s;oon un|deceived, the whole being liable to &s;eizure, as not agreeing with the &s;pecified quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">He then repaired to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and applied to Mr. Sunderland, the Collector. This gentleman knew Metcalf, (being in the habit of vi&s;iting Harrogate) and received him very kindly; but informed him, with much concern, that it was not in his power to &s;erve him, the captors being the exci&s;e people, and not of his department.&mdash;He, however, &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;ome good might re&s;ult from an application to Alderman Peireth, with whom Metcalf was acquainted, and who was particularly intimate with the Collector of the Exci&s;e. The good Alder|man gave him a letter to the Collector; re|pre&s;enting, as in&s;tructed by Metcalf, that the bearer had bought four hundred gallons of &s;pirits, at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at Aberdeen; and that the extra quantity was for the pur|po&s;e of treating the &s;ailors and other friends, as well as for &s;ea-&s;tock for him&s;elf. At fir&s;t the Collector told him that nothing could be done for him, until he &s;hould write up to the Board, and receive an an&s;wer; but Metcalf remon&s;trating on the inconvenience of the
<PB N="120" REF="126">
delay, and the other re-con&s;idering the letter, he agreed to come down to the quay at four o'clock in the afternoon, which he accor|dingly did, and relea&s;ed every thing without expence.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after the regiment called the Queen's Bays were rai&s;ed, they were quar|tered at Knare&s;borough and the adjacent towns; but, after a &s;hort &s;tay, they were ordered to the North. The country people &s;eemed extremely unwilling to &s;upply car|riages for conveying the baggage; the King's allowance being but nine-pence a mile, per ton; that of the County, one &s;hilling in the We&s;t Riding, and fifteen-pence in the North Riding. Metcalf having two waggons, (one of them covered) had a mind to try this new bu&s;ine&s;s; and, to make &s;ure of the job, got the &s;oldiers to <HI>pre&s;s</HI> his two carriages, which were accordingly loaded, him&s;elf attending them to Durham. Previous to loading, however, the country people, who knew the advantage of carrying for the army, and who had kept back, in hopes of an advance in the
<PB N="121" REF="127">
price, came forward with their waggons, in oppo&s;ition to Metcalf; but the &s;oldiers would employ no other.</P>
<P>Arriving at Durham, he met Bland's Dragoons, on their march from the North to York: they loaded his waggons again for Northallerton, and would willingly have engaged them to York; but this he was obliged to decline, having promi&s;ed to bring twenty-three wool-packs to Knare&s;borough. He was ju&s;t &s;ix days in performing this journey; and cleared, with eight hor&s;es and the one he rode, no le&s;s a &s;um than twenty pounds; though many people were afraid to travel with &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Some time after the Queen's regiment had got to Durham, it received the u&s;ual annual recruit of four hor&s;es to a troop. The regiment having been &s;o lately rai&s;ed, had no old hor&s;es: neverthele&s;s, four were to be &s;old from each. Metcalf had notice &s;ent him of the &s;ale, but did not receive the letter until the day before it commenced.&mdash;He &s;et off, however, that afternoon, for Dur|ham, and riding all night, got there by day-break.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="128">His fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to become acquainted with the farriers; &s;o getting about half-a-dozen of them together, and plying them heartily with gin, he began to que&s;tion them as to the hor&s;es which were to be &s;old.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the number to be di&s;po&s;ed of, was a grey one, belonging to one of the drums. The man who had the charge of him not having been &s;ufficiently careful in trimming him, had burnt him &s;everely, which cau&s;ed a prodigious &s;welling. Had this carele&s;s conduct been known to his &s;uperiors, he would have been puni&s;hed for it: upon that account the matter was hu&s;hed up. Metcalf, however, being appri|zed of the real cau&s;e, in the cour&s;e of his conver&s;ation with the farriers, determined to purcha&s;e him, judging that they would be de&s;irous to part with him at any price; and in this conjecture he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The &s;ale began by bringing out &s;even bay hor&s;es; &s;ix of which a gentleman bought for a carriage, and Metcalf purcha&s;ed the &s;eventh.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="129">They then brought forward the grey hor&s;e with his &s;welled &s;heath, which excited many jokes and much laughter among the &s;pecta|tors.&mdash;Our chapman bought him al&s;o, at the very low price of 3l. 15s. od. which was fir&s;t affixed by the auctioneer, but which, how|ever, the people &s;aid was very much beyond his value.</P>
<P>Having u&s;ed &s;uch applications as he thought efficacious for his recovery, by the time he had got him home he had the &s;ati&s;|faction to find him perfectly &s;ound; and within a week afterwards refu&s;ed fifteen guineas for him.&mdash;He kept him many years as a draught-hor&s;e; and the other hor&s;e al&s;o was &s;old to a profit, by which he thought him&s;elf very well paid for his journey to Durham.</P>
<P>In the year 1751 Metcalf commenced a new employ:&mdash;He &s;et up a &s;tage-waggon between York and Knare&s;borough, being the fir&s;t on that road, and conducted it con|&s;tantly him&s;elf, twice a week in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and once in winter; and this bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="124" REF="130">
together with the occa&s;ional conveyance of army baggage, employed his attention until the period of his fir&s;t contracting for the making of roads, which &s;uiting him better, he di&s;po&s;ed of his draught, and intere&s;t in the road, to one Gui&s;eley.</P>
<P>An act of Parliament having been ob|tained to make a turnpike-road from Harro|gate to Boroughbridge, a per&s;on of the name of O&s;tler, of Farnham, was appointed &s;ur|veyor; and Metcalf falling into company with him, agreed to make about three miles of it, viz. between Min&s;kip and Fearn&s;by.&mdash;The materials were to be procured from one gravel pit for the whole length: he therefore provided deal boards, and erected a tempo|rary hou&s;e at the pit, took a dozen hor&s;es to the place, fixed racks and mangers; and hired a hou&s;e for his men at Min&s;kip, which was di&s;tant about three-quarters of a mile. He often walked from Knare&s;borough in the morning, with four or five &s;tone of meat on his &s;houlders, and joined his men by &s;ix o'clock: and by the means he u&s;ed, he com|pleted
<PB N="125" REF="131">
the work much &s;ooner than was ex|pected, to the entire &s;atisfaction of the &s;ur|veyor and tru&s;tees.</P>
<P>During his lei&s;ure hours he &s;tudied mea|&s;urement in a way of his own; and when certain of the girt and length of any piece of timber, he was able to reduce its true con|tents to feet and inches; and would bring the dimen&s;ions of any building into yards or feet.</P>
<P>Near the time of his fini&s;hing this road, the building of a bridge was adverti&s;ed to be contracted for, at Boroughbridge; and a number of gentlemen met for that purpo&s;e at the Crown inn there. Metcalf, among&s;t others, went al&s;o. The ma&s;ons varied con&s;iderably in their e&s;timates. O&s;t|ler, the &s;urveyor of the roads, was appointed to &s;urvey the bridge; and Metcalf told him that he wi&s;hed to undertake it, though he had never done any thing of the kind before. On this, the &s;urveyor acquainted the gentle|men with what Metcalf had propo&s;ed; when he was &s;ent for, and a&s;ked what he knew
<PB N="126" REF="132">
about a bridge: he told them, that he could readily de&s;cribe it, if they would take the trouble of writing down his plan, which was as follows: <Q REND="inline">"The &s;pan of the arch, 18 feet, being a &s;emi-circle, makes 27: the arch|&s;tones mu&s;t be a foot deep, which if mul|tiplied by 27, will be 486; and the ba&s;es will be 72 feet more.&mdash;This for the arch: it will require good backing; for which purpo&s;e there are proper &s;tones in the old Roman wall at Aldborough, which may be brought, if you plea&s;e to give directions to that effect."</Q> The gentlemen were &s;urpri&s;ed at his readi|ne&s;s, and agreed with him for building the bridge. The per&s;ons who had given in their e&s;timates, were much offended; and as the &s;tone was to be procured from Renton, a &s;ale-quarry belonging to one of the ma&s;ons who were there, he was unwilling to &s;ell any to Metcalf; upon which he went to Farn|ham, and found good &s;tones, which the lime-burners had left, (being too &s;trong for their purpo&s;e,) got them dre&s;&s;ed at the place for little money, conveyed them to Borough|bridge,
<PB N="127" REF="133">
and having men to take them off the carriages, &s;et them, and completed the arch in one day; and fini&s;hed the whole in a very &s;hort period.</P>
<P>Soon after, there was a mile and an half of turnpike-road to be made between Knare&s;|borough-Bridge and Harrogate, which Met|calf al&s;o agreed for. Going one day over a place covered with gra&s;s, he told his men that he thought it different from the ground adjoining, and would have them try for &s;tone or gravel, which they immediately did, and found an old cau&s;eway, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made in the time of the Romans, which af|forded many materials proper for the purpo&s;e of making the road. Between the Fore&s;t-Lane head and Knare&s;borough-Bridge, there was a bog, in a low piece of ground, over which to have pa&s;&s;ed was the neare&s;t way; and the &s;urveyor thought it impo&s;&s;ible to make a road over it: but Metcalf a&s;&s;ured him that he could readily accompli&s;h it.&mdash;The other then told him, that if &s;o, he &s;hould be paid for the &s;ame length as if he had gone
<PB N="128" REF="134">
round. Jack &s;et about it, ca&s;t the road up, and covered it with whin, and ling; and made it as good, or better, than any part he had undertaken. He received about four hundred pounds for the road and a &s;mall bridge which he had built over a brook called Stanbeck.</P>
<P>There was an old hou&s;e at Harrogate, with &s;ome fields belonging to it, and denominated a me&s;&s;uage, which was of more value, as having common-right upon the Fore&s;t. It belonged to an old woman, and at her decea&s;e to her hu&s;band. Metcalf went to the latter, and bought his contingent right in the hou&s;e and land; and the old woman came to him &s;oon after, to &s;ell her life-e&s;tate in it al&s;o. They agreed; and including both the net &s;um amounted to eighty pounds. In about three weeks after this purcha&s;e, he &s;old it for upwards of two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>A road being projected between Harro|gate and Harewood-Bridge, &s;ix miles in length, a meeting was held, (the late Lord Harewood, then Mr. La&s;celles, being one of
<PB N="129" REF="135">
the party) to contract with any per&s;on who might be thought proper to make it. A great number of e&s;timates were delivered, but Metcalf obtained the contract. It was to be completed before the winter &s;et in; and being a &s;tiff-clay &s;oil, it was judged expedient to ca&s;t the whole length before they began to &s;tone it: on the&s;e accounts he agreed with the gentlemen, that no carriages &s;hould pa&s;s whil&s;t the road was making; and, by way of prevention, had &s;luices cut at each end of the lane, and wooden bridges, which he took up occa&s;ionally, thrown acro&s;s, for his own carriages to pa&s;s over with the materials. He al&s;o hired two hou&s;es, at a di&s;tance from each other on the road, to entertain &s;trangers who travelled on hor&s;e|back, and the people employed in the under|taking, as there were not &s;ufficient in the country. The &s;hort period he had contracted to complete the work in, obliging him to u&s;e the readie&s;t methods, he had a wheel-plough drawn by nine hor&s;es through the fore&s;t, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t expeditious way to get up
<PB N="130" REF="136">
the roots of whin and ling, in parts where they were &s;trong; and being obliged to &s;uper|intend the progre&s;s of the work, he obtained leave from the innkeepers at Harrogate to engage a &s;ub&s;titute in his ab&s;ence. He com|pleted his contract in the time allowed, to the &s;atisfaction of the gentlemen tru&s;tees, and of the &s;urveyor; and received for the work twelve hundred pounds.</P>
<P>There then being about a mile and an half of road to be made through part of Chapel-Town to Leeds, Lord Harewood and other gentlemen met at the Bowling-Green in Chapel-Town, to receive e&s;timates;&mdash;and Metcalf got the contract. He al&s;o widened the arch of Sheep&s;car-Bridge; and received for that and the road together near four hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Between Skipton and Colne in Lanca&s;hire there were four miles of road to be made, and e&s;timates were adverti&s;ed for. A num|ber of gentlemen met, and Metcalf's pro|po&s;als had the preference. The materials were at a greater di&s;tance, and more difficult
<PB N="131" REF="137">
to be procured, than he expected; and a wet &s;ea&s;on coming on, made this a bad bargain; yet he completed it according to contract.</P>
<P>He next engaged for two miles on the Burnleigh road, which he completed; but was not more a gainer.</P>
<P>He then agreed for two miles of road which lay through Broughton to Martin; and two miles more which lay through Addingham, and over part of Romell's Moor. The &s;ame tru&s;tees acted for tho&s;e roads, as for that of Colne. The&s;e he completed, and received one thou&s;and three hundred and fifty pounds from Mr. Ingham of Burnleigh and Mr. Alcock of Skipton.</P>
<P>After this, a meeting was held at Wake|field, to contract for making part of the road between that town and Halifax.&mdash;Metcalf engaged for four miles which lay between Mill-Bridge and Belly-Bridge; and fini&s;hed this al&s;o, though it was an extremely wet &s;ummer.&mdash;He then took three miles more which lay between Belly-Bridge and Halifax, and completed it.&mdash;And al&s;o agreed
<PB N="132" REF="138">
for five miles which lay between Wakefield and Checkingley-Beck, near Dew&s;bury.</P>
<P>The tru&s;tees of the road, (Sir Rowland Winn, &mdash; Smith and W. Roebuck, E&s;qrs.) meeting at Wakefield, to let part of the road leading to Pontefract, and likewi&s;e from Wakefield to Donca&s;ter, Metcalf took three miles and an half which lay between Hag-Bridge and Pontefract, and one mile and an half on the Donca&s;ter road, from Crofton through Foulby; all which he completed. The road from Wakefield, to Pontefract, Donca&s;ter, and Halifax, being under the management of one company of tru&s;tees, Mr. Allen John&s;on was trea&s;urer for one part, John Mills, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for another, both of Wakefield; and Mr. Valentine Stead, and Mr. William Cook, for the other parts: By the payment of the&s;e four gentlemen he re|ceived &s;ix thou&s;and four hundred pounds.</P>
<P>A road was then adverti&s;ed to be let from Wakefield to Au&s;terland, intended to lead through Horbury, Almondbury, Hudder&s;|field, Mar&s;den, and Saddleworth. A meet|ing
<PB N="133" REF="139">
was held at Huddersfield, for the purpo&s;e. Sir John Kaye, Colonel Radcliffe, 'Squire Farrer, and &s;everal other gentlemen attended, and Metcalf agreed with them from Black-Moor Foot to Mar&s;den, and from thence to Standi&s;h-Foot; al&s;o from Lup&s;et-Gate, thro' Horbury, about two miles and an half. At that time none of the road was marked out, except between Mar&s;den and Standi&s;h-Foot, leading over a common called Pule and Standi&s;h: the &s;urveyor took it over deep mar&s;hes; but Metcalf not expecting it to have been carried that way, thought it a great hard&s;hip, and complained to the gentlemen, alledging it would be a much greater expence: they an&s;wered, that if he could make a complete road, he &s;hould not be a lo&s;er; and they were of opinion, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to dig the earth quite out of the mar&s;hes, until they came to a &s;olid bottom.&mdash;Metcalf, on calculating that each mar&s;h, upon an average, being three yards deep, and fourteen broad, would make two hundred and ninety-four &s;olid yards of earth
<PB N="134" REF="140">
in every rood, which, to have carried away, would have been extremely tedious and ex|pen&s;ive&mdash;and not only &s;o, but that the road lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t, would fill with &s;now in winter, (as it u&s;ually falls in that direction, when the wind is in the North)&mdash;argued the point privately with the &s;urveyor and &s;everal of the gentlemen: but they all &s;eemed im|moveable in their former opinion. Metcalf then appeared at the public meeting, and the &s;ubject was again brought forward; but knowing that it would be to little purpo&s;e to hold a conte&s;t with them, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Gentle|men, as you &s;eem to have a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s before you to-day, it appears quite unnece&s;&s;ary to tre&s;pa&s;s upon your time on this head:&mdash;I propo&s;e to make the road over the mar&s;hes, after my own plan; and if it does not an&s;wer, I will be at the expence of making it over again, after your's:"</Q> which was con&s;ented to. And as he had engaged to make nine miles of the road in ten months, he began in &s;ix different parts, with near four hundred men employed. One of the
<PB N="135" REF="141">
places was Pule and Standi&s;h common, which he ca&s;t fourteen yards wide, and rai&s;ed in a circular form. Water in &s;everal places ran acro&s;s the road, which he carried off by drains; but found the greate&s;t difficulty in conveying &s;tones to the places for the pur|po&s;e, on account of the &s;oftne&s;s of the ground. Numbers of clothiers u&s;ually going that way to Huddersfield market, were by no means &s;paring in their cen&s;ure, and held much diver&s;ity of opinion relative to its completion. But Metcalf got the piece levelled to the end, and then ordered his men to bind heather, or ling, in round bundles, and directed them to lay it on the intended road, by placing the bundles in &s;quares of four, and laying another upon each &s;quare, pre&s;&s;ing them well down. He then brought broad-wheeled carts, and began to lead &s;tone and gravel for covering. When the fir&s;t load was brought and laid on, and the hor&s;es had gone off in &s;afety, the company huzza'd from &s;urpri&s;e. They com|pleted the whole of this length, which was about half a mile; and it was &s;o particularly
<PB N="136" REF="142">
fine, that any per&s;on might have gone over it in winter, un&s;hod, without being wet. This piece of road needed no repairs for twelve years afterwards. Having fini&s;hed the nine miles within the limited time, he took three miles from Standi&s;h to Thur&s;ton Clough, which he completed;&mdash;and afterwards &s;ix miles and an half from Sir John Kaye's &s;eat to Huddersfield; and from thence to Long|royd and Bridge toll-bar, about a mile and an half;&mdash;al&s;o four bridges, their &s;pans twenty-four feet each; together with &s;ix bridges, the &s;pans of which were nine feet each. When all this work was fini&s;hed, (the gentlemen having promi&s;ed that he &s;hould be no lo&s;er) a meeting was called, and Metcalf attended: he a&s;&s;ured them that the work he had completed extra to his fir&s;t bargain, in the mar&s;hes and other places, de&s;erved five hundred pounds: after &s;ome debate, he was allowed three hundred pounds; though it was well worth the fir&s;t-named &s;um. He had made about twenty-one miles in the whole, for which he received four thou&s;and five hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143">In the building of bridges, where the foundations were bad, he laid on a &s;ufficient thickne&s;s of ling where it could be got, otherwi&s;e of wheat &s;traw; he next laid planks five inches thick, with &s;quare morti&s;es cut through; and driving in a number of piles, he made the foundation &s;ecure.&mdash;He then laid &s;prings for the arch upon the planks, which cau&s;ed all to &s;ettle regularly when the weight came on. And though he built many arches, of different &s;izes, by taking this me|thod none ever fell.</P>
<P>He undertook three turnpike-hou&s;es upon the Wakefield and Au&s;terland roads, and completed them all. Believing there was a &s;tone-quarry on the South-Ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud|dersfield, in ground belonging to Sir John Ram&s;den, he bored &s;ecretly in the night-time before he undertook the road, and was &s;uc|ce&s;sful in finding it. After fini&s;hing the road, having &s;ome vacant time, and having likewi&s;e di&s;covered the quarry, Sir John gave him liberty to lead away &s;tone. He now took hou&s;es to build, particularly one belong|ing
<PB N="138" REF="144">
to Mr. Marmaduke Hebdin, nine yards wide, twenty-three yards long, and twenty-one feet from the foundation to the &s;quare of the building;&mdash;it had twenty chimnies or pipes: And this he al&s;o completed.</P>
<P>He undertook the road from Dock-Lane head, in York&s;hire, to A&s;hton-under-Line, in Lanca&s;hire; al&s;o from the guide-po&s;t near the latter place, to Stockport, in Che&s;hire; and al&s;o between Stockport and Mottram-Longdale: the whole length being eighteen miles. He &s;et men to work in different parts, with hor&s;es and carts to each company; and though he lo&s;t twenty hor&s;es in one win|ter, he was not di&s;couraged; ob&s;erving that <Q REND="inline">"hor&s;e-leather had been dear a long time, but he hoped now to reduce the price."</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this misfortune, he com|pleted the whole, including a great number of drains and arches, which were all done to the &s;atisfaction of the tru&s;tees and &s;urveyor; and received for the work four thou&s;and five hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145">He then took eight miles more which re|quired &s;everal drains and arches.&mdash;He rai&s;ed one hollow nine yards, and built &s;ufficiently on each &s;ide to keep up the earth, with bat|tlements on the top; for which he received two thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>One day being met by Sir Geo. Warren, who inquired if he was at lei&s;ure, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he de&s;ired to &s;ee him at his hou&s;e at Poynton. Metcalf went, and agreed to make about five miles of a private road through the Park. He took twelve or fourteen hor&s;es of his own, and brought large quantities of &s;tone into Sir George's grounds, for the u&s;e of draining. For this he received &s;everal hundred pounds, and great favours al&s;o from Sir George and his lady.</P>
<P>A road was to be made between Whaley and Buxton, in Derby&s;hire, to avoid a hill: it went over a tedious piece of ground called Peeling Mo&s;s; the whole road being four miles in length, with &s;ome part &s;trong rock, which was to be bla&s;ted with gunpowder.&mdash;<PB N="140" REF="146">
In taking this road, Metcalf met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition from a &s;on of one of the commi&s;|&s;ioners; but Peter Legh, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Lyme, and another gentleman, &s;upporting Metcalf, he gained the point, and completed the under|taking, with &s;everal drains and fence walls; for which he received near eleven hundred pounds.</P>
<P>He next took a mile and an half of High-Flats, between Huddersfield and Sheffield; and fini&s;hed it likewi&s;e, to the amount of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Eight miles of road were next adverti&s;ed to be made between Huddersfield and Hali|fax. A meeting was held, and &s;everal per|&s;ons attended with e&s;timates for making it. One part was very rocky, and full of hollows, and the ground in a very bad &s;ituation, par|ticularly between Elland and Salter&s;hebble, and through a place called Grim&s;car Wood, which was very boggy and rough. Many were of opinion that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make a road over that ground. But by building up the hollows, and lowering the
<PB N="141" REF="147">
hills, Metcalf accompli&s;hed it:&mdash;And it is worthy of remark, that he never undertook any road which he did not complete, altho' he has taken many which per&s;ons who had their &s;ight dur&s;t not engage in. He fini&s;hed the road, with a great number of fence walls and drains, to the &s;atisfaction of the &s;urveyors and tru&s;tees, and received for it two thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eleven pounds.</P>
<P>A little after this, a road was adverti&s;ed to be made between Congleton and the Red-Bull Inn, in Che&s;hire, about &s;ix miles in length; but the materials were about three miles di&s;tant in &s;everal places. A meeting for letting this road was held at a place called Auder&s;ley, which Metcalf attended; and being a &s;tranger in that part, he fortunately met with three gentlemen who knew him, viz. &mdash; Clows of Macclesfield, &mdash; Downs of Sigleigh, and &mdash; Wright of Mottram, E&s;qrs. two of them Ju&s;tices of the Peace.&mdash;They &s;aid to the tru&s;tees, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, you have only to agree with this man, and you may be a&s;&s;ured of having your work well done."</Q>
<PB N="142" REF="148">
The road, however, was not let that day, the bu&s;ine&s;s being deferred until another meeting to be held at Congleton, where Met|calf and others attended with e&s;timates.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen,"</Q> &s;aid Metcalf, <Q REND="inline">"I am a &s;tran|ger to you, and you may with rea&s;on que&s;tion my performing the bargain; but to prevent any doubt, I will fir&s;t do one hundred pounds worth of work, and afterwards be rea&s;onably paid as it goes forward; the hundred pounds may lay in the trea&s;urer's hands till the whole is completed, and then to be paid."</Q> On this propo&s;al, and the three gentlemen's recom|mendation at the former meeting, they agreed with him, although there was an e&s;timate given in lower than his by two hundred pounds. He completed the road, to the great &s;atisfaction of the &s;urveyor and tru&s;tees, and received three thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>During the time that Metcalf was engaged in making this road, having one day occa&s;ion to &s;top at Congleton, he met, at the Swan inn there, one Warburton, a capital farmer, who lived about a mile di&s;tant. This man
<PB N="143" REF="149">
was remarkable for &s;porting large &s;ums in various ways, and no &s;ooner &s;aw Metcalf, than he acco&s;ted him thus: <Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand that you play at cards."</Q>&mdash;Metcalf replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sometimes, but not often;"</Q> being much &s;urpri&s;ed that a &s;tranger &s;hould know he had that propen&s;ity. Warburton offered to play him for five or ten pounds, the be&s;t of five games at put; but this he thought fit to decline: in the pre&s;ence of his friends he would not have feared to play for twenty; but being in a &s;trange place, and having a large undertaking relative to the turnpikes, he concluded that it would be highly im|prudent to game. The farmer, however, per&s;i&s;ting in his de&s;ire for play, Metcalf, after a little con&s;ideration, determined to try the effect of ridicule on his new acquaint|ance, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I have not now time; but if you will meet me here this day fortnight, I will play you, the be&s;t of five games, for a leg of mutton, four-pennyworth of cabbage, and five &s;hillings worth of punch."</Q> The farmer, plea&s;ed with any pro&s;pect of engaging
<PB N="144" REF="150">
him, agreed to the wager, and in&s;i&s;ted that the money &s;hould be depo&s;ited with the land|lord; which was accordingly done. During the interval, Warburton &s;pread the &s;tory of his engagement to play with a blind man; and, thinking it a good joke, invited many of his friends to the entertainment. Metcalf came at the time fixed, having fir&s;t engaged a friend from Buxton to accompany him, who&s;e chief bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;ee that his adver&s;ary did not play tricks with the cards. Three guineas to two were offered to be laid on Warburton; and Metcalf's friend ob|&s;erving this, expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to take the odds, if agreeable to him: to this, Metcalf replied, that he meant only to amu&s;e him&s;elf by playing for mutton and cabbage; and, that if any &s;ums were laid, he would forfeit his wager. When all parties were a&s;&s;em|bled, Metcalf, out of joke, propo&s;ed to his adver&s;ary to club for all the articles, and treat the company; but this he po&s;itively refu&s;ed, alledging that he had collected his friends for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing the match
<PB N="145" REF="151">
played. On this, Metcalf called to the land|lord for a fiddle, and playing on it for a little while, was a&s;ked by the farmer what he meant: <Q REND="inline">"To enable you,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to tell your children, that when you played with a blind man, you <HI>played to &s;ome tune!</HI>"</Q> They then went into a large room, and were fol|lowed by a crowd of people, among&s;t whom were two Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and &s;everal clergymen. The game now began, and Metcalf won the two fir&s;t; his adver&s;ary got the third, and pulling out his pur&s;e, offered to lay five guineas on the rubber: this was a tickling offer to Metcalf, but having re&s;olved again&s;t playing for money, he made &s;hift to overcome the temptation. Metcalf won the next game; and, of cour&s;e, the rubber. On this the farmer laid a large &s;um on the table, and offered to play for the amount; but Metcalf would only play for liquor, for the good of the company. The farmer agreeing, they began again, and Metcalf pre&s;ently won two games, when a gentleman pre&s;ent &s;hewed a great de&s;ire to play with him for money,
<PB N="146" REF="152">
but in vain; &s;o winning this rubber al&s;o, he &s;addled his antagoni&s;t with the whole &s;core, and not &s;atisfied with the triumph already gained, began to banter him &s;orely on his <HI>childi&s;h</HI> manner of playing, and telling him, that when the road work &s;hould cea&s;e for the Chri&s;tmas holidays, he would come to his hou&s;e, and teach him to play like a <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>The quantity of liquor yet to come in being large, detained many of the company until five in the morning; and Warburton, who had got pretty drunk, by way of com|fort, declared before parting, that of twenty-two fine cows, he would rather have lo&s;t the be&s;t, than have been beaten &s;o publicly.</P>
<P>Metcalf apprehending that he might now be &s;olicited by many to engage in play, and con&s;idering the importance of his other en|gagements, called a&s;ide Mr. Rolle, the &s;ur|veyor of the road, and begged of him to give &s;ixpence, upon condition of receiving five pounds, if he (Metcalf) &s;hould play any more at cards for eighteen months, the time allotted to fini&s;h the road. Mr. Rolle appro|ving
<PB N="147" REF="153">
highly of this, they returned to the company, and Metcalf making the propo&s;al, received the &s;urveyor's &s;ixpence publicly; and thus put an end to all further importunity.</P>
<P>Here Metcalf finds it his duty to &s;u&s;pend, for a while, his road-making narrative, to introduce, for the la&s;t time, the mention of the much-loved Partner of his cares, whom he had brought into Che&s;hire, and le&s;t at Stockport, that &s;he might avail her&s;elf of the medical advice of a per&s;on there, famed for the cure of rheumatic complaints, of which de&s;cription her's was thought to be:&mdash;But human aid proving ineffectual, &s;he there died, in the &s;ummer 1778, after thirty-nine years of conjugal felicity, which was never inter|rupted but by her illne&s;s or his occa&s;ional ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>In his treatment of her, Metcalf never lo&s;t &s;ight of the original di&s;tinction in their cir|cum&s;tances, always indulging her to the ut|mo&s;t that his own would allow; but &s;he had no unrea&s;onable de&s;ires to gratify. She died in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t year of her age, leaving four children; and was buried in Stockport church-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154">In 1781 the road between Wetherby and Knare&s;borough was let.&mdash;He undertook that part which led through Rib&s;ton and Kirk-Deighton, till it joined the great North road leading from Boroughbridge to Wetherby; and al&s;o built two toll-hou&s;es upon the road; and received about three hundred and eighty pounds.</P>
<P>Metcalf had a daughter married in Che&s;hire, to a per&s;on in the &s;tocking bu&s;ine&s;s. The manufacturers in this line, in the neighbour|hood of Stockport, talked of getting loads of money; and Metcalf thought that he would have a portion of it al&s;o: he accordingly got &s;ix jennies and a carding engine made, with other uten&s;ils proper for the bu&s;ine&s;s; bought a quantity of cotton, and &s;pun yarn for &s;ale, as &s;everal others did in the country. But it co&s;t him much trouble and expence, before he got all his uten&s;ils fixed: the &s;peculation likewi&s;e failed; and a time came when no yarn could be &s;old without lo&s;s. Then Met|calf got looms, and other implements proper for weaving calicoes, jeans, and velverets:&mdash;for having made the cotton bu&s;ine&s;s an object
<PB N="149" REF="155">
of particular attention, he was become very well acquainted with the various branches of it. He got a quantity of calicoes whitened and printed, his velverets cut, dyed, &amp;c. and having &s;pun up all his cotton, he &s;et off with about eight hundred yards of fini&s;hed goods, intending to &s;ell them in York&s;hire, which he did at Knare&s;borough and in the neighbour|hood; and his &s;on-in-law was to employ his jennies until he came back. On his return, coming to Mar&s;den near Huddersfield, where he had made a road &s;ome years before, he found that there was to be a meeting, to let the making of a mile and an half of road, and the building of a bridge over the river that runs by the town, &s;o as to leave the former road, in order to avoid the &s;teepne&s;s of a hill. At the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome of his friends, he &s;taid till the meeting, and agreed with the tru&s;tees. The bridge was to be twelve yards in the &s;pan, and nine yards in breadth. The&s;e too he completed, and received a thou&s;and pounds; but the &s;ea&s;on being wet, and the ground over which he had to bring his ma|terials very &s;wampy, and at a di&s;tance from the road, he lo&s;t con&s;iderably by it.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">In 1789 he was informed that there was a great quantity of road to be let in Lanca&s;hire: he accordingly went, and took a part between Bury and E&s;lington, and another part from E&s;lington to Ackrington; as al&s;o a branch from that to Blackburn. There were &s;uch hollows to fill, and hills to be taken down, to form the level, as was never done before: in &s;everal of the hollows the walls were ten yards high, before the battlements were put on the top. He had two &s;ummers allowed to fini&s;h this work in; but the trade in Lanca&s;hire being bri&s;k, made wages very high, and the navigation at that time cutting through the country &s;o employed the men, that it was a very difficult matter to procure a &s;ufficiency of hands. The fir&s;t &s;ummer the rains were &s;o perpetual, that he lo&s;t about two hundred pounds; but in the next he completed the whole work, and received by the hands of Mr. Carr of Blackburn three thou&s;and five hundred pounds; and, after all, was forty pounds lo&s;er by it.</P>
<P>In the year 1792 he returned into York|&s;hire; and having no engagement to employ
<PB N="151" REF="157">
his attention, he bought hay to &s;ell again, mea&s;uring the &s;tacks with his arms; and having learnt the height, he could readily tell what number of &s;quare yards were con|tained, from five to one hundred pounds value. Sometimes he bought a little wood|&s;tanding; and if he could get the girth and height, would calculate the &s;olid contents.</P>
<P>From that period he has &s;ettled on a &s;mall holding at Spofforth, near Wetherby; and his hou&s;e is kept by a daughter and &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>At Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">as, 1794, he paid a vi&s;it to the pre&s;ent Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">el Thornton, and his mother, at Thornville-Royal; and the reception he met with was &s;uch as fully reminded him of former days at Old Thornville, where he had &s;pent many Chri&s;tma&s;&s;es. The truly re&s;pectable Relict, and the worthy Repre&s;entative, of his late Commander, always receive Blind Jack with a conde&s;cending affability, highly flat|tering to one in his humble &s;tation.</P>
<P>Having known the &s;treets of York very accurately in the earlier part of his life, he determined, on the commencement of the la&s;t year, to vi&s;it once more that ancient city,
<PB N="152" REF="158">
where he had not been for the &s;pace of thirty-two years: He found alterations for the better in Spurriergate, Blake&s;treet, the Pavement, &amp;c. and being now in the neighbourhood of Middlethorp, where he had, in the year 1735, &s;pent a half-year &s;o happily, he re&s;olved to have another <HI>look</HI> at it, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its pre&s;ent worthy ma&s;ter. From Mr. Barlow's hou&s;e there is a road which leads to Bi&s;hop|thorpe; and this road he clearly recollected, though &s;ixty years had elap&s;ed &s;ince he had gone that way before: &s;o rete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was his memory on this occa&s;ion, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covered an alteration in the hanging of two gates by a wall-&s;ide near the above man&s;ion. At Mr. Barlow's he &s;taid &s;everal nights, which, he &s;carcely need add, were &s;pent mo&s;t agreeably, he endeavouring to make his fiddle &s;peak the &s;atisfaction and hilarity felt by its owner. Returning to York, he &s;pent a few nights at the hou&s;e of another friend; and &s;etting out on the 10th of January, 1795, he walked to Green-Hammerton, in his way to Thornville-Royal, in about three hours and an half, being
<PB N="153" REF="159">
ten miles; proceeded to Thornville that night, and to Knare&s;borough next morning the 10th, which being the birth-day of Sir Thomas Sling&s;by's elde&s;t &s;on, and which was kept with the utmo&s;t fe&s;tivity, he re&s;olved to &s;pend at the worthy Baronet's. Here he clo&s;ed the fe&s;tive &s;ea&s;on of Chri&s;tmas, after a tour of &s;ome weeks among&s;t his friends;&mdash;to whom, in particular, he &s;ubmits, with the utmo&s;t deference, this imperfect Sketch of a LIFE, with which only can terminate his grateful remembrance of their numerous favours.</P>
