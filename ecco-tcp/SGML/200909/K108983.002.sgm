<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH WILL SHEW THAT THE SNAKE WAS SCOTCHED&mdash;NOT
KILLED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As I intimated at the end of the fir&s;t volume, that the pranks
of the mad mu&s;ician, extraneous as at fir&s;t &s;ight they mu&s;t appear, had
relation, and very &s;trongly too, to the main and mo&s;t material part of my
de&s;ign, &s;o I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew in what way.</P>
<P>The reader will allow me that, according to the letter of my
de&s;cription, which really did not outgo the fact, the bu&s;tle at the inn
mu&s;t, to &s;trangers, and particularly ladies, have been alarming to a 
<PB N="6" REF="4"> great degree; and when it is con&s;idered that Lady Hazard
was &s;even months gone with child, it will not appear very extraordinary that,
terrified in &s;o unexpected and particular a manner, it &s;hould have &s;uch
an effect upon her tender and delicate frame, as to throw her into labour,
which it actually did.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t, upon this news, undertook to produce a
gentleman of the faculty from London, whither he went as fa&s;t as a chai&s;e
and four hor&s;es could convey him, accompanied by Charles, who&s;e anxiety for
his mother was &s;trongly manife&s;ted in his heartening and encouraging the
po&s;tillions. My Lord however was not idle. There were &s;everal towns near at
hand, and each of them boa&s;ted its man-midwife; &s;o fa&s;hionable was it
even then, to adopt a cu&s;tom which the landlord &s;wore&mdash;as he &s;tirred
the kitchen fire to prepare for the nece&s;|&s;ary potations upon this
occa&s;ion&mdash;was a di&s;grace to the Engli&s;h nation; a cu&s;tom to which
our ance&s;|tors, who had nerves that, like their bows, twanged with
&s;trength, were utter &s;trangers. He &s;aid it was a cu&s;tom originating
from &s;loth and effiminacy; that it was one of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed
improvements to|wards the annihilation of manline&s;s and becoming decency that
our natural enemies did us the favour to introduce every day; that it was
unmanly and <PB N="7" REF="5"> &s;candalous as well as ignorant and ridiculous,
for that the mo&s;t experienced practitioner could not po&s;&s;ibly, from the
nature of the circum&s;tance, ar|rive to any thing comparable to the knowledge
of a woman upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to whom every po&s;&s;ible &s;ymptom
mu&s;t be practically known, and who&mdash;which with our landlord was
nine-tenths of his argument&mdash;could alone conduct &s;uch a particu|lar
bu&s;ine&s;s with proper decorum.</P>
<P>In this temper he &s;ent for a good old lady, who, he &s;aid,
had been ob&s;tetric gentlewoman u&s;her to half the town, and never had met
with an accident, unle&s;s from &s;uch a combination of natural cau&s;es as
would have baffled the utmo&s;t perfection of art.</P>
<P>The old lady, who re&s;ided in the neighbourhood, arrived
fir&s;t, and Lord Hazard, extremely anxious to procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance, made
no &s;cruple of introducing her to his wife.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay,' cried the landlord, as he poured her
out a gla&s;s of u&s;quebaugh, 'this is as it &s;hould be; here, my lord, is an
operator, and plea&s;e you, worth a thou&s;and of your men-midwives; fellows
that I believe would rather have the reputation of getting children than of
bringing them into the world. I once a&s;ked a chap of this &s;tamp what 
<PB N="8" REF="6"> made all the children he produced &s;o cur&s;ed
rickety?&mdash;and he an&s;wered me, with great arch|ne&s;s, that a man had a
right to mar what he made.'</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the landlord's rhetoric, he was obliged to
pull in his horns when he under&s;tood that Lady Hazard's ca&s;e was of &s;o
particular a kind that the good old gentlewoman, his friend, could not venture
to proceed in it upon her &s;ingle judg|ment. Being a&s;ked what he &s;aid to
this, he replied he was &s;till right:&mdash;it happened to be one of tho&s;e
difficult ca&s;es which required a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but yet the gentleman,
whoever he was, would reap great be|nefit from the old woman, who would be able
to explain to him all he had to do, and from a convic|tion, being a woman, that
he could not have the &s;malle&s;t conception of.</P>
<P>Before morning, arrived three gentlemen, who had been &s;ent for
from different towns, and pre&s;ently afterwards Standfa&s;t, Charles, and an
eminent man-midwife from London, who, upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, attended her
lady&s;hip. A number of corks were heard to report their liberty, and hot wine,
po&s;&s;ets, and other comfortable drinks &s;moked all over the hou&s;e; yet,
though the landlord was greatly plea&s;ed at what went forward, when he ca&s;t
his eyes upon the medical tribe, he could not help remarking that 
<PB N="9" REF="7"> he did not believe there was half &s;o much fu&s;s when king
ARTHUR was born.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t gentleman who arrived, the re&s;t of cour&s;e gave
way. He immediately vi&s;ited Lady Hazard, and &s;hortly afterwards found it
nece&s;&s;ary to have a private conver&s;ation with his lord&s;hip:&mdash;nor
will the reader be greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, though very much &s;hocked, to hear
that, in the cour&s;e of this conference, it came out that the peculiarity of
Lady Hazard's ca&s;e originated with Mi&s;s Snaffle!</P>
<P>Lord Hazard's feeling on this occa&s;ion was not &s;imply
wretchedne&s;s, it was horror. Standfa&s;t was called in, that the whole might
be explained to him; in doing which, my lord u&s;ed &s;uch forcible lan|guage,
&s;o execrated him&s;elf, and &s;o extolled the high, the tran&s;cendent
friend&s;hip of the tutor, that the &s;urgeon, who was both a &s;en&s;ible man
and a valuable member of &s;ociety, declared he was charm|ed at the
circum&s;tance, and &s;hould be very happy to cultivate Mr. Standfa&s;t's
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon being now particularly informed of the ca&s;e,
declared that a very di&s;agreeable operation mu&s;t be performed; but he hoped
the life of Lady Hazard was not in danger. He &s;aid he could ea&s;ily give the
matter a turn to the other phy&s;ical gentle|men, <PB N="10" REF="8"> who, he
could plainly &s;ee, were ignorant pre|tenders to a profe&s;&s;ion in which
they had neither right nor ability to practice; and this, he &s;aid, he
conceived materially nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of Lady Hazard's peace of
mind, which it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to pre&s;erve if the matter were known
to any but him&s;elf:&mdash;it being a practice with the&s;e gentry, at which
indeed they are very expert, to injure the dome&s;tic, as well as the
corporeal, con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard, finding that every thing might be managed without
confiding to his lady the real cau&s;e of her pre&s;ent danger, declared he
would wait the event with patience and re&s;ignation, which turned out as the
&s;urgeon had predicted, the child was de&s;troyed, but the lady &s;urvived the
operation. As to the old woman, &s;he was &s;ent home as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, for the &s;urgeon agreed &s;o far with the land|lord, that he
feared much more a di&s;covery through her, than through his brother
profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>It was nearly &s;ix weeks before Lady Hazard could be with
&s;afety removed; during which time, her kind friend Lady Roebuck &s;carcely
&s;tirred from her. Nor was the baronet le&s;s attentive to my lord. He had
&s;et his heart upon &s;timulating that nobleman to an emulation of his own
conduct, when they &s;hould arrive in Warwick&s;hire, and doubted not, as 
<PB N="11" REF="9"> he knew Lady Hazard longed for the accompli&s;h|ment of
&s;o de&s;irable an end, when he &s;hould ex|plain to his friend how
practicable &s;uch a ta&s;k was, and how &s;ure and immen&s;e the reward, he
would readily join him in &s;o meritorious an exerci&s;e of that liberality
which Lord Hazard, whatever were his foibles, certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, the time rolled in&s;en|&s;ibly
on; for as &s;oon as Lady Hazard could be re|moved, &s;he was, for the
pre&s;ent, conveyed to a hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, which her lord had hired
for that purpo&s;e; and as the company Sir Sidney ex|pected for the &s;ummer
called, of nece&s;&s;ity, at the John of Gaunt's Head, in a few days the poet,
painter, and mu&s;ician made their appearance, as well as Sir Sidney's
attorney, and a clergyman, all of whom, by invitation, were to pa&s;s the
&s;ummer at Roebuck hall.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly having now &s;o largely increa&s;ed, parties of
plea&s;ure were planned; and as Lady Ha|zard's health &s;eemed every day to be
more confirm|ed, the general tranquillity was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>As to my lord, his re&s;olution was made, and cer|tainly
irrevocably. Therefore, as no wor&s;e con&s;e|quences had happened from his
former conduct, he <PB N="12" REF="10"> rejoiced at the pre&s;ent moment in the
&s;ame degree as a patient who, by a trifling and immaterial mu|tilation, is
re&s;tored to health and vigour from the morbid effects of a gangrene.</P>
<P>The great difficulty with Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck was how to
proceed as to Standfa&s;t. It was impo&s;&s;ible to begin their attack on Lady
Ha|zard, as it would ruffle her mind in her pre&s;ent weak condition; and as to
my lord, he was &s;o wrapped up in his amiable friend, that it would be
impracticable, as well as highly ab&s;urd, to attempt at undeceiving him.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate were matters &s;ituated when the cler|gyman
lately mentioned arrived at the inn. This gentleman, who&s;e name was Friend,
had been known to Sir Sidney for many years, and was not the le&s;s e&s;teemed
by him for having incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of a bi&s;hop, becau&s;e he
would not vote again&s;t his con&s;cience. He was a very learned, and, what is
a great deal better, a very &s;en&s;ible man; for though he had little of that
under&s;tanding by which men ri&s;e in the world, and which, according to
nine-tenths of mankind, is the only mental coin that ought to pa&s;s current,
yet he had a number of old fa&s;hioned virtues, of no great u&s;e but to the
owner; but to him valuable indeed:&mdash;&s;uch as piety, <PB N="13" REF="11">
an un&s;ullied con&s;cience, a benevolent heart, with the addition of a clear
judgment, an inventive ge|nius, and a critical and accurate knowledge of
an|cient and modern literature.</P>
<P>As Sir Sidney's was a kind of hou&s;e of call to good characters
out of employ, no wonder this gen|tleman was &s;ometimes with him. His vi&s;it
at pre|&s;ent, however, was on another account; for the baronet, to tell the
reader the truth, was not with|out hopes of &s;eeing him rector of Little
Hockley. He had been &s;ome time nominated curate; and, at the death of the
pre&s;ent incumbent, the living would be in the gift of Lord Hazard. That this
circum|&s;tance, which has not been mentioned before, may not appear
extraordinary, I &s;hall now explain how it came about.</P>
<P>When Sir Sidney wrote to Lord Hazard, as we have &s;een,
relative to Little Hockley, he little dreamt that his application would have
produced all the cordiality that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them.&mdash;On the
contrary, there was more of delicacy than hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in con&s;ulting
him at all.</P>
<P>To Mr. Standfa&s;t, however, he did not conceive he owed any
&s;uch delicacy; and therefore, as the right of nominating a curate reverted to
the rector, <PB N="14" REF="12"> at the death of Major Malplaquet, di&s;liking
the bargain and &s;ale manner in which it had been tran&s;|acted before, he
applied, in the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible way, to the good pa&s;tor, for the
appointment of Mr. Friend to that &s;ituation: namely, by making an offer to
commute with him for the entire pro|fits of the living, at a very hand&s;ome
price, and to pay the curate's &s;alary out of his own pocket.</P>
<P>The rector, who could calculate much better than he could
preach, entered into the whole &s;pirit of the argument, and Mr. Friend became
to Sir Sid|ney, what Mr. Standfa&s;t had been formerly to Ma|jor Malplaquet.
This was the rea&s;on why Mr. Figgins removed to his vicarage, who, officiating
for &s;ome &s;hort time at Little Hockley, while the negociation was pending
between Sir Sidney and the rector, became known to the baronet and Mr. Friend,
both of whom believed him to be a very valuable young man, and Sir Sidney, in
particular, a&s;&s;ured him that if he could in future be of any &s;er|vice to
him, it would give him plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In a few days after the arrival of Mr. Friend, Standfa&s;t had
&s;o ingratiated him&s;elf into his good opinion, that the worthy man was
charmed with him. Indeed Standfa&s;t &s;aw plainly that this was a good medium
of recommendation to Sir Sidney, <PB N="15" REF="13"> who&s;e friend&s;hip, for
&s;ome rea&s;on or other, he was &s;trenuou&s;ly de&s;irous to cultivate.
Perhaps, as pro|vidence appeared to have re&s;cued Lord Hazard from his
immediate gripe, he had &s;ome &s;imilar favour in contemplation for the
baronet.</P>
<P>Certain it is that the damning proof which Sir Sidney and his
lady imagined they had again&s;t Mr. Standfa&s;t, which was only pre&s;umptive,
began to &s;ink before tho&s;e po&s;itive proofs which &s;eemed every day to
announce his reformation from a number of crimes which he made no &s;cruple to
&s;ay he had formerly committed; and this, added to the tran&s;port he
ap|parently felt at the re&s;toration of that happine&s;s which now began to
gild the moments of Lord and Lady Hazard, gave this fortunate gentleman &s;uch
a favourable place in the hearts of all about him, that really an accu&s;ation
to his prejudice, though ever &s;o plau&s;ibly urged, would probably have
gained but little faith, unle&s;s backed by very weighty, and indeed undeniable
proof again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sir Sidney really had not. The utmo&s;t he could alledge
was that di&s;&s;ipation and tho&s;e irre|gularities which Standfa&s;t
confe&s;&s;ed and di&s;claimed, except indeed a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of his
being con|cerned in all the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Snaffle, which, if this
recent behaviour was not hypocri&s;y, amounted <PB N="14" REF="14">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="15" REF="15">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="16" REF="16"> to
nothing, and which was corroborated only by an intercepted letter, and even
that&mdash;the re&s;t not proved&mdash;would al&s;o fall to the ground.</P>
<P>The proof alluded to was the very letter which Standfa&s;t
fancied had not been &s;ent, but, upon fur|ther enquiry he found him&s;elf
mi&s;taken; yet, as it had made no alteration in Lady Hazard, he was convinced
it had not been properly delivered, and was afterwards confirmed in that
opinion, when he found it had been given to Lady Roebuck's foot|man.</P>
<P>In fact, Lady Roebuck's &s;ervant, on that very fatal afternoon,
delivered her a letter at Lady Ha|zard's, where &s;he happened to be waiting
for Sir Sidney, who promi&s;ed to meet her there at tea time. Lady Hazard was
luckily writing letters in her own room, and her friend had ju&s;t taken up a
favourite author, from which employ being interrupted by 
<Q REND="inline">'a letter for your lady&s;hip,'</Q> &s;he,
without further ceremony, opened it, and read the&s;e words: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I cannot refrain from acquainting you that your hu&s;band
has an intrigue with an infa|mous woman, and you will be a&s;&s;ured that I
tell <PB N="17" REF="17"> you truth, when my intelligence is proved to you by
his &s;taying out the greate&s;t part of this night. Probably you may gue&s;s
the quarter from whence you receive this, and as revenge is completely in your
power, why not obey its dictates in favour of one who will not be ungrateful to
your incom|parable charms?</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P> Sir Sidney, who came in while &s;he was yet read|ing it, cried
out, 
<Q REND="inline">'So, &s;o, I have caught you in the fact, have
I? What tender epi&s;tle have you there?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Only a di&s;covery of your tricks, my love,'
&s;aid &s;he.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read that; but, before you &s;ee a word,
remember I tell you it originates with Mr. Stand|fa&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>As this conduct was no le&s;s hand&s;ome than u&s;ual in Lady
Roebuck, her hu&s;band was neither &s;ur|pri&s;ed at that nor at the contents
of the letter. In|deed they laughed &s;o heartily at it, that their mirth
&s;erved only to double their concern when, upon looking at the direction,
which neither of them had noticed before, they &s;aw it was addre&s;&s;ed to
Lady Hazard.</P>
<P>They were now indeed &s;trongly confirmed it came through Mr.
Standfa&s;t, and after having in&s;i|nuated <PB N="18" REF="18"> away Lady
Hazard's time till the latene&s;s of the evening convinced them there was too
much truth in the letter, they retired, and, when alone, formed that
determination which we have &s;een &s;o re&s;olutely made at the end of the
fir&s;t volume, and now almo&s;t abandoned at the very beginning of the
&s;econd.</P>
<P>The latter end of the letter Lady Roebuck thought could allude
to no other than Standfa&s;t; for though &s;he had heard of the bu&s;ine&s;s of
Dog|bolt, yet &s;he could not avoid looking upon that to be over&s;trained, and
that the tutor at the bot|tom was the object who wanted to recommend him&s;elf;
and indeed Lady Hazard, who wi&s;hed to di&s;gui&s;e nothing from her friend,
did not &s;cruple to &s;ay there were times when &s;he had &s;imilar
&s;u&s;|picions, though always, upon reflection, &s;he was convinced &s;he did
him wrong.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t, being as con&s;eious of all the&s;e matters as
if he had known their thoughts, com|batted the effects of tho&s;e re&s;olutions
they had taken in the manner we have &s;een; and thus, though continually on
the brink of a di&s;covry, he traver&s;ed the verge of the precipice on which
he was placed as &s;ecurely, though not &s;o harmle&s;sly, <PB N="19" REF="19">
as SHAKESPEARE's pea&s;ant upon Dover cliff; for the pea&s;ant is de&s;cribed
as gathering a purifier of the blood, while the par&s;on was &s;earching for
what|ever could inflame and corrupt it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A KIND OF WHITE CROW&mdash;THREE OTHER CURIOSITIES, AND A SAFE
ARRIVAL IN WARWICKSHIRE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As we &s;hall have &s;omething to do with all tho&s;e characters
which I have lately introduced to the reader's notice, it may not be ami&s;s if
I men|tion a word or two of each in this place.</P>
<P>The attorney, who&s;e name was Balance, had long been a great
favourite of Sir Sidney; not becau&s;e he had a remarkable number of
enemies&mdash;though that was very often a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the
baronet to e&s;pou&s;e a man's intere&s;t&mdash;but becau&s;e he had great
profe&s;&s;ional integrity and private worth. I &s;hall in a moment explain how
this gentleman conjured up &s;uch a ho&s;t of foes, by &s;aying that he
mortally hated roguery, though a lawyer. Indeed it had been doubted, by many of
his brother profe&s;&s;ors, whe|ther his odd notions and &s;trange practice did
not &s;o decidedly operate again&s;t that &s;tronge&s;t of all laws, cu&s;tom,
to the detriment of the general intere&s;t, that a point might be made to
&s;trike him off the rolls. <PB N="21" REF="21"> For, &s;aid they, very
learnedly, 
<Q REND="inline">'as u&s;age has, time out of mind, regulated
laws; as u&s;age has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed that it &s;hall be lawful for attornies
to ap|propriate to them&s;elves not only the money, goods, and chattles, lands
and tenements, wives and chil|dren, con&s;ciences, peace of mind, nay even the
liberty and lives of their clients; and as this &s;aid lawyer Balance
ab&s;olutely rejects in toto, all &s;uch general power over his clients,
&s;hamefully con|tenting him&s;elf with moderate and rea&s;onable re|compence
from tho&s;e in who&s;e behalf he has &s;uc|ceeded, and &s;candalou&s;ly
declining to pro&s;ecute and pur&s;ue to their ruin, &s;uch as he plainly
&s;ees have been already plucked and pillaged, till they totter under the
weight of their accumulated mi&s;|fortunes:&mdash;quere, whether, by trampling
upon cu&s;tom, which is paramount to law, and explain|ing ju&s;tice and equity
to be the &s;ame thing, which, for the better promotion of cavils and
arguments, have been con&s;idered, time immemorial, to have di&s;tinct and
different meanings, and looked upon as things that ought to be for ever kept
&s;eparate and apart, the &s;aid lawyer Balance ought not to under|go a heavy
cen&s;ure of the court for the fir&s;t offence, to be &s;u&s;pended during
plea&s;ure for the &s;econd, and if, upon returning to practice, he &s;hould be
found infringing this cu&s;tom, this u&s;age, this law, this ju&s;tice, this
equity, a third time, then, <PB N="22" REF="22"> and in that ca&s;e, to be
con&s;idered as incorrigible, and rendered incapable to practi&s;e in his
maje&s;ty's courts of ju&s;tice!'</Q></P>
<P>No one of the&s;e gentlemen, however, being pa|triot enough to
ri&s;e up and re&s;cue the laws from the gripe of &s;o bold an innovator, he
went on with this illicit practice to the great terror of the petti|fogging
tribe&mdash;many of whom he had cau&s;ed to be &s;truck off the rolls&mdash;and
to the admiration of all good men, and, among the foremo&s;t, his particular
friend Sir Sidney.</P>
<P>We come now to the arti&s;ts. The&s;e were the &s;ame who had
vi&s;ited Roebuck hall for the la&s;t three years; for though the baronet had
formerly made a point of having a new &s;et every &s;ea&s;on, he at la&s;t gave
up that plan, finding, upon taking them in|di&s;criminately, that he brought
home with him little more than a cargo of vanity, ignorance, and affectation.
Having &s;earched, therefore, with great care, and met with three a little more
to his mind, though they certainly were &s;trange kind of oddities, he &s;tuck
to them, and being now accu&s;tomed to their &s;ingularities, and finding
nothing in them that exceeded folly, they really furni&s;hed him with a fund of
amu&s;ement, independant of their profe&s;|&s;ional abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"> The poet, Mr. Ego by name, was, at lea&s;t
in his own opinion, as much any thing el&s;e as a writer. He knew every thing,
and, what is very extraordi|nary, better than any body.</P>

<P>This company, upon Lady Hazard's recovery, &s;e|parated into two
parties; one of which &s;et off for the &s;eat of my lord, and the other for
that of the baronet; till at length, by the ringing of bells and the
acclamations of all the inhabitants, they were welcomed to Little Hockley and
Ca&s;tlewick.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney threw his eyes complacently around 
<PB N="26" REF="26"> him, which &s;parkled with the &s;atisfaction of
be|holding &s;o many &s;incere adherents; and he did not at that moment a
little plume him&s;elf upon the hope of &s;eeing his friend in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;olid enjoyment.</P>
<P>The meeting between Sir Sidney's friends and Annette was tender
beyond expre&s;&s;ion. My lord declared he never &s;aw &s;o &s;weet a creature.
Charles thought her hand&s;ome, but babyi&s;h. His mind in|deed ran upon riper
charms, for he had &s;o little of the delicacy of love in his compo&s;ition,
that he con|ceived him&s;elf a perfect Cae&s;ar, and having made &s;o many
fir&s;t &s;ight conque&s;ts, he was yet to learn the plea&s;ure of
&s;olicitation.</P>
<P>It is a &s;hame to talk thus of a boy of eighteen, but really
Mr. Standfa&s;t had &s;o well remembered the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed
between him and Viney, previous to his introduction to Lord Hazard, that the
young gentleman had already experienced the &s;ecre&s;y of the very &s;ame
&s;urgeon who&s;e cautious con|duct we were witne&s;&s;es of in the la&s;t
chapter. This gentleman, to &s;ay the truth, was a perfect HIPPO|CRATES. As
well as the medical &s;kill of that an|cient, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his
prudence; for he &s;eemed to adhere to the famous oath of his predece&s;&s;or,
in which he enjoined him&s;elf to make his patient's <PB N="27" REF="27"> good
his principal aim, and that whatever he &s;aw or heard in the cour&s;e of his
practice, or otherwi&s;e, relative to the affairs of life, nobody &s;hould ever
know, if it ought to remain a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The country and its amu&s;ements had infu&s;ed &s;uch plea&s;ure
and &s;atisfaction into every member of this &s;ociety, that nothing was &s;een
but cheerfulne&s;s.&mdash;They mu&s;tered up a tolerable concert at Sir
Sidney's, a thou&s;and good humoured &s;allies circulated in the way of
impromptues and epigrams, and &s;ketches of each others &s;ingularities were
handed about, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of all but tho&s;e immediately
ca|ricatured. Charles was pretty adroit in each way, and having a greater
licence, his &s;trokes were bolder, and, in every other re&s;pect, at lea&s;t a
match for the re&s;t. In &s;hort, there was no part of their time un|filled by
&s;ome plea&s;ure to every per&s;on's ta&s;te; for it was a maxim with Sir
Sidney that all was fair in which there was no premeditated mi&s;chief. As for
the re&s;t, Mr. Friend began to experience very agree|able effects from his
efforts at Little Hockley, e&s;pe|cially as they were &s;econded by the
exhortations of Standfa&s;t, who they knew had been a great &s;inner, and who
now a&s;&s;ured them that he was become a great penitent.</P>
<P>Thus, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every plea&s;ure a &s;miling
coun|try, <PB N="28" REF="28"> profu&s;e liberality, joyful hearts, and
ingenious heads could produce, their happine&s;s would have been complete had
it not been damped by the indi&s;|po&s;ition of Lady Hazard, who, a &s;hort
time after their arrival in the country, evidently fell into a gra|dual
decline.</P>
<P>This, in a great mea&s;ure, prevented Lord Ha|zard from a
participation in the general happine&s;s, and gave occa&s;ionally no little
unea&s;ine&s;s to Sir Sid|ney and Lady Roebuck. My lord, however, in proportion
as he &s;hunned the general hilarity, courted the charms which he found in
private me|ditation, and the exerci&s;e of that benevolence to which he was
&s;o forcibly &s;timulated by Sir Sidney.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW GUEST&mdash;AND THE DEPARTURE OF AN OLD
ONE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MATTERS wore this face when Charles, who had been in continual
anxiety relative to the &s;ituation of Mi&s;s Figgins, &s;aw her brother one
morning ride into the park. It was about the time when the young gentleman
flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould become a father, and having acco&s;ted Mr.
Figgins, who re|turned his &s;alutation with bare civility, he was con|vinced
this manly achievement of his had been crowned with the expected &s;ucce&s;s.
Relying how|ever on the friend&s;hip of Mr. Standfa&s;t, he felt ra|ther
&s;atisfied than otherwi&s;e on the &s;ubject, and im|mediately appeared as
coldly civil as the young cler|gyman.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins was &s;hewn to Mr. Standfa&s;t, with whom he held a
long conference, the re&s;ult of which our hero waited for with impatience; and
he was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed when the two gentlemen came towards him in
terms of very high altercation.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="30"> Charles could di&s;tinctly hear Standfa&s;t
&s;ay 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come, this is a little too
ra&s;cally.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ra&s;cally!' cried the other.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' replied Standfa&s;t, 'for it is
impo&s;&s;ible that you can be ignorant of her cha|racter:'</Q>&mdash;and then,
&s;eeing Charles, &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'Here is the young gentleman, and I confe&s;s
his conduct was imprudent enough, but &s;ir, I tell you once again it was a
trap for him, and if it had not been for my po&s;itive injunction, &s;o
honourable are his &s;entiments, he would have di&s;graced his family for ever
by marrying your &s;i&s;ter, whom I can prove to be a woman void of reputation.
To tell you the truth &s;ir, this was the cau&s;e of my &s;ilence, and as I am
convinced you mu&s;t have been privy to the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, you need not
expect any further countenance from my lord, the bi&s;hop, or any other of my
friends.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Figgins declared that if Mr. Standfa&s;t could in the
&s;malle&s;t degree prove what he a&s;&s;erted, he &s;hould abandon his
&s;i&s;ter as a wretch unworthy his protection. He prote&s;ted his total
ignorance of her character, and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured Mr. Standfa&s;t he knew
nothing of the intrigue between her and our hero, till&mdash;&s;eeing her
palpably in a condition that would &s;hortly bring di&s;grace on him,
particularly becau&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion and connections&mdash;he taxed her
with the fact, and &s;he, with great unwillingne&s;s, <PB N="31" REF="31">
di&s;covered to him what had pa&s;&s;ed. He uttered a very florid &s;peech on
the &s;ubject of ingratitude, and declared he &s;hould dete&s;t him&s;elf if he
could be ca|pable, even was his benefactor&mdash;meaning Mr.
Stand|fa&s;t&mdash;to withdraw his countenance and protection for ever from
him, to meditate any return that could militate again&s;t tho&s;e honourable
&s;entiments of pure and grateful acknowledgment which were eminently his
due.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t confe&s;&s;ed, till this bu&s;ine&s;s, he had
always con&s;idered him as a very thankful, proper, decent, grateful young
man:&mdash;nay he might recol|lect he had given hints that there would be no
ob|jection to count upon his future favour; and really, if he could acquit
him&s;elf&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'Will you &s;uffer me to &s;peak?' &s;aid
Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to Mr. Figgins, I mo&s;t &s;incerely beg his
pardon for the irregularity I was guilty of in his hou&s;e. That he &s;hould
know any thing of it is morally impo&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e his &s;i&s;ter told
me that &s;he &s;incerely believed he would be the death of her, if he found it
out; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, this has at times given me &s;o much anxiety, that
if I had not promi&s;ed you, Mr. Stand|fa&s;t, upon my honour&mdash;which I
hope will ever be a &s;acred pledge with me&mdash;to leave the whole to your
di&s;cretion, I certainly &s;hould, long ago, have written to Mr. Figgins, and
laid all the blame on <PB N="32" REF="32"> my&s;elf, where it certainly ought
to fall: I am very happy to have this opportunity of coming to &s;o proper an
explanation, and will readily abide by the determination of Mr. Standfa&s;t in
relation to my future conduct.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Charles,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'your
con|duct in this, as in every thing el&s;e, is perfectly hand&s;ome. Perhaps my
zeal for your honour and that of your noble father has hurried me too far, and
induced me to treat Mr. Figgins with more har&s;hne&s;s than he merited. I will
take his word for what he a&s;&s;erts, becau&s;e really, as I &s;aid be|fore,
there has always been &s;omething about him like ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, gratitude,
and a proper &s;en&s;e of obligation.'</Q>&mdash;Here Figgins bowed&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'If there|fore matters go in the old train as to
him, I beg that it may extend to his &s;i&s;ter.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is the point I wanted to come to,' &s;aid
Charles. 'I a&s;&s;ure you we were both betrayed into what we did, for neither
of us originally meant more than a very harmle&s;s gratification.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t. 'Come, come,
Charles, you might be a Lubin, but &s;he was no Annette I a&s;&s;ure you. No,
no, Figgins,' added Standfa&s;t, taking Charles by the hand, 'my pupil here,
whom <PB N="33" REF="33"> I hope to &s;ee a duke, is no match for your
&s;i&s;ter, even were there not that bar which I will hereafter convince you
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts. In the mean time, let the bantling come forth, and be brought
up:&mdash;we will find a provi&s;ion for it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Figgins was now invited to &s;pend a few days in the family,
to which he con&s;ented. Indeed the time pa&s;&s;ed &s;o agreeably, that a
fortnight had elap&s;ed before he ever dreamt of taking his leave. Charles,
during this interval, became very intimate with him, and Mr. Friend and the
good Mildman&mdash;which la&s;t declared he began to have hopes of Little
Hockley the moment the young gentleman had ap|peared among them&mdash;were
charmed with his &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t the reader, who knows his origin, too ha&s;tily
credit that I am advancing any thing unna|tural or unlikely. Art does not
require brilliant talents, and no people in the world are &s;o ea&s;ily
im|po&s;ed upon as good men. Pay but a mode&s;t deference to your own opinion,
that you may not &s;eem too &s;ervile; &s;truggle a little with conviction
before you appear to yield to it; and, though you give up points with
reluctance, never fail in the end to crown your adver&s;ary with the palm of
victory:&mdash;<PB N="34" REF="34"> and be a&s;&s;ured of friends wherever you
choo&s;e to make them.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t knew mankind &s;urely. This young man was bred up
under him; and as he had &s;trong intellects, rather an engaging figure, a
retentive memory, a wonderful natural penetration, a col|lected and &s;hrewd
&s;agacity, with a fortunate knack of chequering his conver&s;ation with bits
and &s;craps of philo&s;ophy and morality, which he had &s;tudied, it is not at
all a&s;toni&s;hing that he &s;hould be mi&s;taken for a &s;en&s;ible and good
man by &s;uch as, could they have di&s;covered any defects in him, would rather
have excu&s;ed than expo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t, one day, having received &s;ome letters from
London, came to my lord, and in|formed him that his uncle was at the point of
death. Of this uncle Lord Hazard had heard him &s;peak, and always under&s;tood
he had great expectations from him. He therefore begged that no time might be
lo&s;t, but that the tutor &s;hould in&s;tantly &s;et out to &s;ee his
relation. This was the more rea|dily agreed to becau&s;e Mr. Figgins could
&s;tay to &s;u|perintend his pupil's &s;tudies, which indeed now con&s;i&s;ted
of nothing more than reading and com|paring different authors, a part of which
exerci&s;e <PB N="35" REF="35"> he plea&s;ures of the country took off; not to
reckon nis attention to painting and mu&s;ic, in both of which he was a great
proficient.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries adju&s;ted, Mr. Standfa&s;t took his leave
of his good friends in Warwick&s;hire, and repaired to London; from whence, in
a &s;hort time afterwards, he informed Lord Hazard that, his uncle being dead,
he was left independant; but that he &s;hould &s;till con&s;ider him as his
benefactor, and would, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have &s;ettled his affairs,
wait on him. He anxiou&s;ly enquired after Lady Ha|zard, whom he had left in a
very declining &s;tate of health; hoped his pupil was plea&s;ed with Figgins,
whom he took the liberty to recommend as his tu|tor, while he &s;hould need a
per&s;on in that capacity, and offered to relinqui&s;h in his favour that
annuity which his lord&s;hip had &s;ettled on him for life.</P>
<P>My lord replied in a &s;uitable manner to this letter. He
wi&s;hed his friend joy of his good fortune; drew a melancholy picture of Lady
Hazard's &s;ituation; enlarged mo&s;t pathetically on his own treatment of her;
&s;olemnly declared if he &s;hould lo&s;e her all his happine&s;s would be at
an end; con&s;ented with plea|&s;ure to his propo&s;al concerning Figgins, but
po&s;i|tively refu&s;ed&mdash;though he was determined to take care of the
young man&mdash;to &s;uffer the &s;malle&s;t re&s;ti|tution <PB N="36" REF="36"> of that which he, Standfa&s;t, had infinitely more than
de&s;erved:&mdash;winding up the whole with a &s;trong contra&s;t between the
great and exalted me|rit of his friend, and his own unworthine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;ummer was gliding away, during which
&s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed that did not bring with it &s;ome new plea&s;ure;
but yet Lady Ha|zard's indi&s;po&s;ition was a cloud that dimmed this &s;erene
&s;ky. As mo&s;t of the&s;e amu&s;ements however were calculated for the
alleviation of her pain, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e which Charles
conducted&mdash;for he doated on his mother&mdash;their enjoyments &s;uffered
but little diminution on her account. In the mean time our hero's &s;entiments
changed in&s;en&s;ibly every day in favour of Annette, though really his heart
was yet a perfect &s;tranger to the delicious &s;en&s;ations of delicate love;
and tho&s;e he did feel, young as he was, upon &s;o proper an occa&s;ion he
well knew how to &s;uppre&s;s. He had &s;ome warm thoughts cer|tainly as to
Emma, and knowing as much of books as her&s;elf, he very archly conceived a
de&s;ign of con|quering her with her own weapons; but, finding her virtue too
well fortified to yield to his &s;olicita|tions, he made an honourable retreat,
greatly to her &s;atisfaction, who was not in the lea&s;t angry; for virtue,
with her, was &s;lender indeed that could not with&s;tand every trial. On the
contrary, &s;he ven|tured <PB N="37" REF="37"> to predict that Annette was his
de&s;tined wife, but fore&s;aw his imprudence would co&s;t many a mu|tual heart
ach before the accompli&s;hment of their de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Charles certainly had not the &s;malle&s;t objection to
con&s;ider Annette in the light of an intended wife, nor was he by any means,
as I have already &s;aid, in&s;en&s;ible to either her beauty or
accompli&s;hments; and therefore&mdash;e&s;pecially as he had the &s;anction of
both his and her parents&mdash;he paid her the exacte&s;t attention, and lo&s;t
no method nor opportunity of in&s;piring her with &s;entiments highly to his
advan|tage. But he had ever &s;et his heart on &s;eeing the world, and that not
&s;uperficially, before he &s;hould &s;ink into a dome&s;tic character, which
he always conceived would be a clog to the exertions of a vo|latile mind, like
his; unle&s;s he could be a&s;&s;ured, by repeated experience, that his partner
for life was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e many and &s;carce attractions which
would &s;o bind his inclinations as to make him prefer bondage to liberty.</P>
<P>The attention he paid Annette had, however, a different effect
on that young lady. Their little plea&s;ures were, it is true, not more than
the &s;ports of children; but there was &s;uch an unaffected ea&s;e, &s;uch
&s;weetne&s;s of temper, &s;uch an engaging and &s;o <PB N="38" REF="38">
in&s;inuating an addre&s;s in our hero, without the &s;malle&s;t tincture of
art, or illiberality, that, with|out her own knowledge, &s;he imbibed the
&s;eeds of that poi&s;on which, according to Emma's predic|tion, was de&s;tined
to give her many a bitter pang.</P>
<P>Little Hockley was now improving very fa&s;t.&mdash;Mr. Balance
had routed the two attornies I for|merly &s;poke of, who, upon examination,
were found to have practi&s;ed without the &s;malle&s;t quali|fication. The
painter had completed a picture of the return of the prodigal &s;on, which was
placed in a con&s;picuous part of the church, and the mu&s;ician had opened a
fine organ, the gift of Sir Sidney, un|der which the poet affixed a very
elegant latin in|&s;cription, which Emma &s;aid ought to have been in
Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>It had been an invariable cu&s;tom to celebrate the baronet's
birth-day by throwing open the doors of the man&s;ion hou&s;e, and fea&s;ting
all comers. In the afternoon &s;everal &s;ports were performed on the green,
and, in the evening, the company retired to a very large ru&s;tic
a&s;&s;embly-room, where Sir Sidney always opened the ball; and after he had
&s;een that his tenants and neighbours had every thing they could wi&s;h for,
to give their plea&s;ure free &s;cope, he <PB N="39" REF="39"> retired with
their warm and unfeigned good wi&s;hes for a continuance of his health and
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Since Sir Sidney's marriage, however, this fe&s;ti|val had been
kept on his wedding day, and this was called the grand fea&s;t:&mdash;for there
were three others to celebrate, the birth-day of him&s;elf, that of Lady
Sidney, and that of Annette. But the&s;e happening near each other, and Sir
Sidney not choo&s;ing to fill his tenants heads with too profu&s;e an
inclination for plea&s;ure, he held the&s;e fe&s;tivals on the four quarter
days, when he never failed to lighten the hearts of tho&s;e who, from
unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity, could not be punctual with their rent.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o remarkable in the con|duct of the day
which united the two villages, that I &s;hall take a fre&s;h chapter to
de&s;cribe it: flattering my&s;elf that no one will blame me for dwelling upon
a &s;ubject the fitte&s;t that can be to produce benevo|lent ideas.</P>

&s;olicited upon this occa&s;ion. The poet, painter, and mu&s;ician produced a
ma&s;que in con|junction, and Charles wrote and &s;et an ode, as 
<PB N="41" REF="41"> well as painted the decorations for it; and it was
allowed&mdash;though that might be the company's par|tiality&mdash;to be the
complete&s;t performance of the day.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard's department was to receive the company, and
accommodate &s;uch as could not find room at Sir Sidney's. Charles had the
manage|ment of the amu&s;ements, and Mr. Friend, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mildman and
Figgins, undertook to pre&s;erve decency and decorum. The company which
ar|rived on the Sunday evening were &s;erved in the apartments provided for
them, and permitted to &s;up and retire at their own time.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock on the Monday morning, the two villages were
awoke by ringing of bells, a di&s;|charge of cannon, and other demon&s;trations
of joy. This done, &s;everal me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched to reque&s;t
their attendance at a rural amphitheatre fitted up for the purpo&s;e, in the
front of the rookery. There, by eight o'clock, the company a&s;&s;embled; and,
after a &s;hort but pathetic hymn to the deity, had breakfa&s;t &s;erved up to
them by children, in white and fle&s;h-colour dre&s;&s;es, ornamented with
flowers, who drew the mo&s;t delicious beverages from a variety of urns,
di&s;tributed about in niches.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42"> Coffee, tea, and chocolate, were relieved
by ca|pilaire, orgeat, lemonade, and &s;herbet; while the mo&s;t odoriferous
perfumes mingled their artificial &s;weets with the ro&s;es and je&s;&s;amine,
that &s;hed their emanations as they interlaced the &s;urrounding treil|lage.
Cakes, comfits, and liqueurs, were &s;een in great variety and abundance; and
after the com|pany had amply refre&s;hed them&s;elves, during a per|formance of
the mo&s;t touching and melting airs, each Ganemede and Hebe moved a &s;pring,
and in&s;tantly played in the centre of every alcove a foun|tain of ro&s;e
water, for the u&s;e of ablution; which ceremony was &s;ucceeded by a
proclamation, that every one was at liberty to take &s;eparate diver&s;ion till
eleven o'clock, when they were expected on the lawn, in order to go to church
in proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This proce&s;&s;ion, though &s;imple, was &s;triking. It was
preceded by twenty-four wool-combers, each of whom carried &s;ome ornament of
their profe&s;&s;ion. Twelve others followed, with banners, on which were
di&s;played a variety of ingenious devices.&mdash;Twenty-five inhabitants of
Ca&s;tlewick, and as many of Little Hockley, &s;ucceeded, one of each place
linked arm in arm, in token of brotherly love. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded a band of
mu&s;ic:&mdash;then came the &s;tewards with golden wands, who were followed by
<PB N="43" REF="43"> their a&s;&s;i&s;tants with &s;ilver ones. Lady Roebuck,
Lady Hazard, and Annette came next, in an open carriage: the&s;e were
&s;ucceeded by a large number of other carriages, and the&s;e again by about
two thou&s;and &s;pectators.</P>
<P> Being orderly &s;eated at church, the &s;ervice was performed,
and an excellent &s;ermon preached by Mr. Mildman, from the text 
<Q REND="inline">'There is more joy in heaven over one &s;inner
that repenteth, than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons, who need no
repentance.'</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ervice over, they returned in the &s;ame
or|der&mdash;with this difference:&mdash;twelve morrice dancers met them on
their way, and conducted them in a mazy round to the lawn, where all
di&s;per&s;ed, and, after promi&s;cuous ambulations about the garden, retired
to dre&s;s for dinner, which, at three o'clock, &s;moaked in the grand
&s;aloon, for the company within doors, and on the lawn for all who cho&s;e to
partake of it.</P>
<P>In the &s;aloon Lady Roebuck held her &s;tate, and Sir Sidney
played the humble ho&s;t. Annette, on one &s;ide, &s;at with all the blooming
fre&s;hne&s;s of a new blown ro&s;e; and, on the other, poor Lady Hazard,
pallid as a drooping lily. On the table <PB N="44" REF="44"> was elegantly
di&s;tributed a mo&s;t &s;umptuous fea&s;t, admirably contra&s;ted, and
delicately &s;erved up. Nor did their plea&s;ure receive a &s;mall addition
from the hearty vacant mirth that a&s;&s;ailed them from the lawn&mdash;which
the &s;aloon overlooked&mdash;where &s;at as many happy gue&s;ts as could
&s;urround an ox, two bucks, and four &s;heep, all roa&s;ted whole; at which
Emma &s;at in imitation of Lady Roebuck, and the butler&mdash;who was the very
&s;ervant &s;o faithful to Sir Sidney in France&mdash;attended, like his
ma&s;ter, to &s;up|ply the wants of the company.</P>
<P>Many loyal toa&s;ts were proclaimed by a di&s;charge of cannon,
and pledged by the company without. At length the lawn was cleared, coffee
introduced into the &s;aloon, and, in a &s;hort time after, notice given that
the ode written by our hero was going to be performed in the ru&s;tic
amphitheatre, where the company had breakfa&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;aloon was now prepared for the ma&s;que, to which the
company were de&s;ired to repair in fancy dre&s;&s;es, but without vizors.
Previous however to the performance, as &s;oon as it became &s;ufficiently
dark, they were led by the morrice dancers through a &s;erpentine walk to the
canal, where, on the oppo|&s;ite bank, was di&s;charged a mo&s;t &s;uperb
firework, in which the painter had exerted him&s;elf in orna|mental 
<PB N="45" REF="45"> tran&s;parencies, and the poet in apt de|vices.</P>
<P>The ma&s;que over, it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the
univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment when, upon returning to the lawn, they found it
converted into beautiful alcoves, tents, booths, and other receptacles for
different par|ties, where boys and girls, in the mo&s;t picture&s;que fancy
dre&s;&s;es, ran before them, ready to anticipate their very wi&s;hes. Nothing
could exceed the beauty proportion, and di&s;po&s;ition of this city of the
plea|&s;ures, reared as it were by enchantment. Tho&s;e who were not
di&s;po&s;ed, however, to re&s;ort to it for refre&s;hment, were attended and
&s;erved in a manner equally de&s;irable in a &s;uite of rooms in the hou&s;e;
and as to Emma's company, in addition to a review of all the&s;e plea&s;ures at
a becoming di&s;tance, they had their own rural a&s;&s;embly room for their
&s;upper and ball, where I am well informed not one, within &s;ome hours,
gue&s;&s;ed what it was o'clock, till the &s;un &s;ent forth tho&s;e &s;treaks
of crim&s;on which put an end to their harmle&s;s merriment on the Tue&s;day
morning.</P>
<P>Nor did their &s;uperiors &s;eparate one whit &s;ooner, and not
then without regretting that their plea&s;ures were at an end, and declaring
that they never wit|ne&s;&s;ed &s;uch ta&s;te, nor experienced &s;uch
ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P><PB REF="46"> It may not be improper to notice &s;ome of the
principal remarks made on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Annette remarked that Charles looked, &s;poke, and did every
thing divinely. He remarked that &s;he was a lovely little creature; and all
the company remarked that they &s;eemed born for each other.&mdash;Emma
remarked &s;he had made a conque&s;t of the poet, the mu&s;ician, and the
butler; and well know|ing the fidelity of this la&s;t to his ma&s;ter, and
affec|tion to his young mi&s;tre&s;s, declared, as &s;he undre&s;&s;ed Annette,
that &s;he &s;hould have no objection, at a proper &s;ea&s;on, to be the author
of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The poet remarked Emma was a &s;mart wench, and &s;hould be his;
for he was the man in the world for her purpo&s;e. The mu&s;ician agreed to the
fir&s;t remark, but thought they neither of them &s;tood any chance; and the
painter, overhearing them, &s;wore &s;he was a caricature of mother Shipton,
and they were damned fools for talking &s;uch non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard remarked that he had now but one wi&s;h in the
world; and Sir Sidney remarked&mdash;but not to my lord, that this was the
fir&s;t time their grand fea&s;t had been graced with the pre&s;ence of Lady
Hazard, and he greatly feared it would be the la&s;t. Indeed that amiable and
charming lady, <PB N="47" REF="47"> le&s;t &s;he &s;hould dimini&s;h the
general hilarity, exerted her&s;elf on that day beyond her &s;trength, and
though probably the utmo&s;t human care&mdash;for &s;he had every
a&s;&s;i&s;tance that money or influence could procure&mdash;could not have
wholly re&s;tored her, yet, certainly, her now rapid decline was accelerated by
the various &s;hocks, though of temporary plea&s;ure, which &s;he received in
a&s;&s;i&s;ting to promote the happine&s;s of her friends.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A DISPUTE BETWEEN EMMA AND THE POET.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As this is the only entire &s;ummer the reader and I are to
pa&s;s in Warwick&s;hire, I &s;hall explain pretty fully how the time jogged
on. So far it is pretty evident every man's lei&s;ure had been taken up to
prepare for the fe&s;tival, which &s;ome may think I have a little too
particularly de&s;cribed. It has, how|ever, brought about &s;omething,
according to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom; for it made Lady Hazard wor&s;e, which, but
for the &s;ake of moral truth, I &s;incerely wi&s;h had not happened; it lo&s;t
Emma's heart; and it did two or three other things, which will be di|vulged in
proper time.</P>
<P>This grand affair being over, the &s;pare time was filled up
with lighter and le&s;s regular plea&s;ures; among which Charles, in
particular, found the con|trary di&s;po&s;itions of Sir Sidney's &s;cientific
trium|virate excellent food for his frolick&s;ome temper, which, though it had
not the &s;malle&s;t tincture of <PB N="49" REF="49"> mi&s;chief in it, loved
to indulge it&s;elf with expo&s;ing ab&s;urdity. To this Ma&s;ter Figgins egged
him on with all his per&s;ua&s;ion, with no view, however, as he &s;aid, but to
oblige the young gentleman; nor, to &s;ay the truth, did Sir Sidney want a
reli&s;h for &s;uch fun, when every thing was kept within proper decorum.</P>
<P>It did not &s;ignify what the joke was, their argu|ment upon it
produced all the amu&s;ement. Charles very often &s;et the poet down to a
literary contention with Emma, who, being &s;killed in authorities, ge|nerally
conquered him; for really dates and facts are very good materials for
critici&s;m, and method will very often be too hard for genius. Upon the&s;e
occa&s;ions the poet was thru&s;t further into a corner by the &s;atiric
painter, and con&s;oled by the accom|modating mu&s;ician. One afternoon,
however, &s;he gained &s;o complete a triumph, that he was obliged, for a long
time, to own him&s;elf conquered.</P>
<P>The reader remembers that Emma had a very great predelection for
Dr. JOHNSON, and Charles en|treated the poet to attack the lexicographer. This
he did not fail to do, but kept, for a long time, to general accu&s;ations.
Emma de&s;ired he would give her &s;ome opportunity of an&s;wering him. 
<Q REND="inline">'Any <PB N="50" REF="50"> man,' &s;aid &s;he,
'may be made to look contemp|tible. ARISTOPHANES contrived this of SOCRATES,
who, becau&s;e he was a man of inoffen&s;ive man|ners, and therefore naturally
decried the licentious writings and conduct of the comic poets, provoked the
fury of this &s;atiri&s;t:&mdash;but even though this is true, and though
Madame DACIER was &s;o charmed with this author that &s;he
tran&s;lated&mdash;and, not content with that, read two hundred times, and
every time with fre&s;h plea&s;ure, the very piece that was written to render
this great philo&s;opher ridi|culous&mdash;yet it proved nothing, becau&s;e
general a&s;&s;ertion is a blunt arrow that falls without in|flicting a
wound.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, what do you &s;ay to this?' cried
Figgins, who &s;tood by.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Say!' cried the poet, 'If &s;he wants proofs of
what I have a&s;&s;erted, &s;he &s;hall have them; I am the man for adducing
proofs. And fir&s;t of all, has he not written a &s;evere &s;atire on
him&s;elf, when he &s;ays of SWIFT 
<Q REND="inline">"that on all common occa&s;ions he habitually
affects a &s;tyle of arrogance, and dictates rather than per&s;uades?"</Q> In
another place, 
<Q REND="inline">"he predominated over his com|panions with a
very high a&s;cendency, and proba|bly would bear none over whom he could not
&s;o predominate."</Q> Now does not Mrs. THRALE, after a confe&s;&s;ion that
&s;he had &s;urfeited her&s;elf with an <PB N="51" REF="51"> abject and
indefatigable attention to him for a number of years, &s;uch as no man who did
not in a mo&s;t in&s;olent degree predominate over his com|panions could exact,
does &s;he not declare &s;he could no longer bear him, and that &s;he went to
Bath becau&s;e &s;he knew he would not follow her? Is not Mr. BOSWELL every
moment frightened to death le&s;t there &s;hould be a total breach between
them? Does not the Doctor meditate an entire &s;eparation only becau&s;e Mr.
BOSWELL had the im|prudence to leave him for a few minutes, with truly the
&s;hameful intention of contributing to his ea&s;e and convenience? What do you
&s;ay to all this? Does not this convince you that my a&s;&s;ertions are
truth?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no, &s;ir,' an&s;wered Emma, 'we were to
talk of a poet, you are &s;peaking of a man.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'A good eva&s;ion,' &s;aid Ego, 'and in the
Doc|tor's own way. I am the man for &s;eeing what people are about:&mdash;but
come, you &s;hall have him as a poet. And pray, does he not wi&s;h to de&s;troy
the very being of poetry, by in&s;i&s;ting on annihi|lating mythology? Does he
not find it very re|prehen&s;ible in Mr. GAY to introduce Cloacina and the
nightman in his Trivia? and does he not abu&s;e poor PRIOR mo&s;t unmercifully
for fabling that <PB N="52" REF="52"> Chloe was mi&s;taken one day by Cupid for
Venus, and another for Diana? In &s;hort, mythology is, with him, puerility. He
&s;ays of Collins that he loved faries, genii, giants, and mon&s;ters! and that
while he pur&s;ued the&s;e objects, he did not &s;uffici|ently cultivate
&s;entiment: when all the world knows that there is an end of poetry if
&s;entiment is no longer to be conveyed through &s;o rich and beautiful a
vehicle. What do you &s;ay to this abu&s;e of the gods and godde&s;&s;es? Is
not it &s;hame|ful?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No &s;ir,' &s;aid Emma, 'not at all, for a man
may abu&s;e &s;uch imaginary beings without injuring any body's moral
feelings.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Another eva&s;ion,' cried the poet, 'I will be
judged by any body. But I will go a plainer way to work. Here is a critici&s;m
of his that is &s;tark non&s;en&s;e. In &s;peaking of Mr. GRAY's lines on the
death of a cat that was drowned as &s;he at|tempted to catch a gold fi&s;h, the
la&s;t line &s;ays, that all that glitters is not gold; nor if it were, &s;ays
the doctor, would the cat have been the better for it, for a cat does not know
the value of gold. Now I &s;ay &s;he does, in the &s;en&s;e it is here meant,
which is nothing more than that we are not to tru&s;t to appearances; and a cat
knows that, as far as her <PB N="55" REF="53"> under&s;tanding goes, as well as
a man. Can you controvert this, Mrs. Emma? No, no, I am the man for clo&s;e
rea&s;oning. All that glitters is not gold &s;ure enough. What do you &s;ay to
my argu|ment?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That it is not &s;terling, &s;ir,' &s;aid
Emma.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your learned principal would have given the
&s;ame vague an&s;wer,' &s;aid the poet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come, why does he take no more notice of
COLLINS's ode than if no &s;uch poem had ever been written? Can you an&s;wer me
that?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ea&s;ily, &s;ir,' &s;aid Emma; 'it was written
for mu&s;ic, which he did not under&s;tand.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is a pity then,' &s;aid the poet, 'that he
did not under&s;tand it; for he cannot &s;hew &s;uch harmony in his own poetry,

<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Emma, 'he was profound.'</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'Zounds,' cried the poet, 'you would make a man
mad; I am a man that is never in a pa&s;&s;ion, but damme madam&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>Here every body interfered, and it was univer&s;ally allowed
that Emma had gained a complete victory. 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' &s;aid Emma, &s;till imitating Dr.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF SHAM GHOSTS, AND A VALIANT TAYLOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this repul&s;e which the poet &s;u&s;tained from
Emma, he had really a penchant for her, and as &s;he loved reading, he
flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould &s;ucceed by acknowledging her victory over him
in the di&s;pute already mentioned, and &s;ubmit|ting tacitly to her opinion in
all literary matters.</P>
<P>This amorous intercour&s;e, at lea&s;t that which appeared &s;o
to the mu&s;ician, began to make him a little unea&s;y, for he flattered
him&s;elf with pretty near the &s;ame hopes as the poet. Seeing this, Charles
and his a&s;&s;ociates hit upon a plan which they thought would afford them
&s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Charles very archly intimated to Toogood that Emma, in her own
mind, gave him the preference, but, added he, you will lo&s;e her owing to your
ab|&s;urd diffidence. In &s;hort, after proper preparatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> he propo&s;ed to him a &s;cheme which he &s;aid would 
<PB N="54" REF="56"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB REF="57"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="56" REF="58"> evince his love for Emma, even without wounding his mode&s;ty by
declaring it, would bring out her real &s;entiments towards him, and would
finally frighten Ego into a relinqui&s;hment of his preten|&s;ions to her.</P>
<P>The kind Mr. Toogood agreed to the propo&s;al with but little
he&s;itation. It was this: the a&s;&s;o|ciates were to report that the
mu&s;ician had hanged him&s;elf for love, and, to give it a colour, while he
hid him&s;elf in a garret&mdash;where, by the way, they almo&s;t &s;tarved him,
under a pretence that nobody could come to him for fear of a
di&s;covery&mdash;his fian|nel powdering gown was put upon a &s;tuffed figure,
and hung as it were artfully by the neck to a &s;taple in his bed chamber; and
this was &s;hewn to the poet, in the du&s;k of the evening, in a way &s;o well
managed, that he really took it for the mu&s;ician.</P>
<P>The poet, willingly enough, ran, as he was de|&s;ired, for help,
and, in the interim, the powdering gown was &s;hifted from the figure to
Toogood him|&s;elf, who&s;e face had previou&s;ly been &s;meared by the painter
with a compo&s;ition of a cadaverous hue; there|fore, when he returned, and
found Toogood &s;tretched upon the bed, he had not the &s;malle&s;t doubt but
that he had made his final exit. Pre|&s;ently afterwards Emma came into the
room, and <PB N="57" REF="59"> being properly in&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e,
began to lament her hard fate, and to utter &s;o many tender things in favour
of the mu&s;ician&mdash;calling him her Orpheus, her Amphion!&mdash;In &s;hort
&s;he flew into &s;uch apparent rapture, that Charles and Figgins feared the
crotchet-monger would have jumped up, and appea&s;ed her upon the &s;pot. She
&s;aid this country was now deprived of a &s;econd PURCEL, but where could they
find another DRYDEN to record his prai&s;e?</P>
<P>Ego an&s;wered bri&s;kly, that DRYDEN to be &s;ure was a very
pretty poet, but there was one yet in the world, he flattered him&s;elf, as
capable of &s;inging the virtues of a decea&s;ed friend as mo&s;t people.</P>
<P>Emma took him at his word, &s;aying &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould
never be able to bring her&s;elf to love him&mdash;though &s;he would try what
&s;he could do&mdash;yet her friend&s;hip he might always command, if he would,
as a la&s;t tribute to his friend's memory, write his epitaph.</P>
<P>This &s;ettled, the company di&s;per&s;ed. Charles lifted up his
hands, Figgins ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, the poet in profound meditation,
Mu&s;quito &s;wearing it &s;erved the fool right, and Emma quite in a tragedy
rant: The poet de&s;ired he might have a &s;light &s;up|per <PB N="58" REF="60"> in his apartment, and pen, ink, and paper.&mdash;The mu&s;ician, who
had acted his part very well, was locked up, and every body retired.</P>
<P>Ego was heard for &s;ome time to walk about his room in great
agitation, and afterwards to draw his chair and &s;it down very &s;till to
work. In &s;hort, he had fini&s;hed the ta&s;k ju&s;t at that moment 
<Q> 
<L>'When church yards yawn,</L> 
<L>'And hell it&s;elf breaths forth contagion to the
world!'</L></Q></P>
<P>Being charmed with his production, he began to read it aloud,
and afterwards was heard to exclaim, 
<Q REND="inline">'I never was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in my life!
Once more&mdash;'</Q>and then reading&mdash;
<Q> 
<L>'Here Toogood lies, by de&s;p'rate pa&s;&s;ion
<HI>drove,</HI></L> 
<L>'Who, great mu&s;ician, hanged him&s;elf for
love!'</L></Q></P>
<P>He &s;carcely had uttered the&s;e words, when open flew the
door, and the mu&s;ician appeared in his powdering gown, with a halter round
his neck, ex|claiming in a hollow voice 
<Q REND="inline">'And &s;o I did, perfidi|ous poet.'</Q> The
bard, like Pierrot&mdash;though the mu&s;ician looked that character more than
he did&mdash;now began to &s;tare, to tremble, and, without quit|ing either the
paper or the candle, blundered to the further &s;ide of the bed, where the
gho&s;t, with a mo&s;t <PB N="59" REF="61"> gha&s;tly grin, glided after him.
Seeing him&s;elf fol|lowed, he &s;prang acro&s;s the bed at the expence of his
&s;hins, and out of the door, the gho&s;t hard at his heels, when hurrying down
the &s;tairs&mdash;which were &s;trewed with peas, unknown to either of them,
they rolled over each other till they lighted on a feather bed, purpo&s;ely
laid at the landing place, where all the company in the hou&s;e bur&s;t in at
once, and found them cuffing one another almo&s;t as un|mercifully as Mr. POPE
makes the two eagles in HOMER.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ician began now to perceive that he had been duped as
well as the poet. Sir Sidney &s;aid he was &s;orry to find the mu&s;ician had
played upon &s;o ridiculous a chord; to which Charles an&s;wered, his
performance was perfectly in the amoro&s;o &s;tyle.&mdash;Emma &s;aid that to
be &s;ure he had given a dying proof of his love, but not knowing that he would
recover, &s;he, out of de&s;pair, had cho&s;en another.&mdash;The painter
&s;aid it was not the fir&s;t time Mr. Too-good had made him&s;elf ridiculous.
The poor mu|&s;ician, getting up, laughed the matter off as well as he could.
He &s;aid his known character was to ac|commodate him&s;elf, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, to the plea|&s;ure of the company; and as to the poet, he &s;aid
he &s;u&s;pected it was a trick from the beginning, for he was the man at
di&s;coveries! He &s;wore he would <PB N="60" REF="62"> have acted a dead man
ten times better; and as for a gho&s;t! 
<Q REND="inline">'Damme,' &s;aid he, 'if I had per&s;onated a
gho&s;t, I would have &s;cared you all out of your wits!'</Q></P>
<P>After a hearty laugh, Emma fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s by a few
&s;erious words, &s;aying, that they had both hung them&s;elves up as marks of
ingratitude, in re|turn for Sir Sidney's ho&s;pitality; yet, if the gho&s;t of
remor&s;e did but haunt them a little, for enter|taining a wi&s;h to injure a
poor girl, who had no|thing to depend upon but her character, &s;he &s;hould,
for her own part, think them &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>A truce was &s;truck, and good humour re&s;tored, or rather
prolonged; for none of the parties enter|tained the lea&s;t rancour: on the
contrary, the mu|&s;ician was the fir&s;t to confe&s;s he had been ju&s;tly
re|proved for his error, and Ego &s;aid he was an ad|mirer of poetical
ju&s;tice, which he flattered him&s;elf he had exemplified pretty &s;trongly in
his writings.</P>
<P>About this time a matter happened which had very nearly undone
&s;ome of Sir Sidney's pious work at Little Hockley. One John Swa&s;h, a
miller, who was at the head of a large family, and one of the fir&s;t who
repented of his former idle tricks, had been &s;et up by Sir Sidney, and had
lived for &s;ome <PB N="61" REF="63"> time in comfort and credit. This man, at
the in|&s;tigation of &s;ome litigious per&s;ons, who envied his pre&s;ent good
fortune, had been taken up for &s;heep-&s;tealing: a crime which he certainly
had committed &s;ome years before. He was to be tried at Warwick, at the
&s;ummer a&s;&s;izes, and Sir Sidney greatly feared the fact would be fully
proved; in which ca&s;e, it would be difficult to &s;ave the man.</P>
<P>But this was not the wor&s;t, for a number of the Hockleyites,
having been guilty of crimes equally enormous, might, on his conviction,
emigrate from the village, where they began to live peaceable and decent lives;
and thus he &s;hould lo&s;e the fruits of that benevolent harve&s;t which he
had been &s;o long and &s;o carefully bringing to perfection.</P>
<P>There was but one man who could &s;wear to his identity; except
indeed a companion, who having been formerly di&s;charged by a magi&s;trate, on
ac|count of this fact, now appeared as king's evidence, to curry favour with
the farmer, who&s;e &s;heep had been lo&s;t, as well as to &s;creen him&s;elf
from future pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>This man, who, as I &s;aid, could &s;wear to him, was a taylor,
and lived, at this time, in pretty good credit at Wellingborough, but had
formerly worked <PB N="62" REF="64"> as journeyman at a &s;mall town not far
from Little Hockley, and when bu&s;ine&s;s was not very &s;tiring there, was
glad enough to job about at other places, and return to his wife and family
with the earn|ings.</P>
<P>He had been three days getting ready &s;ome mourning for a
family in the neighbourhood, when, being upon the point of returning on a very
dark night, he was reminded, by &s;ome officious friend, that he mu&s;t go
&s;even miles about, for that over the common, which was but little more than
three, he would certainly meet with the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be under&s;tood that on this common was erected a
gibbet, where were hung in chains two &s;mugglers, who had murdered an
exci&s;eman; and under this gibbet every evening were &s;een&mdash;for a great
number of the inhabitants within &s;ome di&s;tance round were ready to &s;wear
it&mdash;two men in white marching with much deliberation, and carrying a
coffin.</P>
<P>The taylor had frequently heard all this, but as it rained a
little, and the way over the common lay &s;o much nearer than the other, he
could not think or going round:&mdash;be&s;ides he was perfectly, at this 
<PB N="63" REF="65"> time, pot valiant, and one more gla&s;s put the
fini&s;h|ing &s;troke to his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Away went the taylor with his wages in his pocket, and his
goo&s;e &s;u&s;pended on a &s;tick, which he held over his &s;houlder. When he
came near the gibbet, &s;ure enough he &s;aw two men carrying a coffin. His
&s;en&s;ations may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at. He was &s;eized with &s;o
&s;trong a fit of horror, that his teeth chattered, his legs &s;hook, he
trembled from head to foot, and &s;weat at every pore. He made an effort to run
away, but his limbs refu&s;ed their of|fice. At length, as the &s;pectre
approached, with one frantic &s;truggle, between fear and de&s;peration, his
well-poi&s;ed goo&s;e flew from the &s;taff that &s;up|ported it like
lightning, and hitting the head of the gho&s;t that was neare&s;t to him,
brought him to the ground&mdash;when lo! open flew the coffin, and out jumped
two &s;heep!</P>
<P>The other &s;pirit, uncon&s;cious that he had only one-ninth of
an adver&s;ary to encounter, took to his heels, and &s;oon di&s;appeared. The
fir&s;t, however, &s;tunned by the blow he had received, could not &s;o
ea&s;ily get out of the taylor's clutches, who being convinced of the fact by
the information of the two &s;heep, pur&s;ued his victory, and actually tied
the <PB N="64" REF="66"> culprits hands with a large piece of li&s;t, in order
to carry him before a magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The &s;heep&s;tealer pleaded very hard for his liberty as &s;oon
as he came to him&s;elf, when the taylor, knowing his voice, pre&s;ently
recognized him for the very &s;ame John Swa&s;h, who now, at the di&s;tance of
almo&s;t three years, was confined in Warwick jail for this individual
offence.</P>
<P>The general opinion was that the taylor had com|pa&s;&s;ionated
the &s;ituation of John for a valuable con|&s;ideration, which was, in the
nature of a fine, to be paid by in&s;tallments, but had not been regularly
di&s;charged. Finding however that the offender be|gan to be pretty well off in
the world, the &s;ubject was revived, and the matter carried by the farmer, at
the in&s;tigation of the taylor, to the length we have &s;een.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the circum&s;tances which made Sir Sidney unea&s;y.
He plainly &s;aw that Swa&s;h was picked out not with a view to offer a public
&s;acri|fice at the &s;hrine of offended ju&s;tice, but merely to be u&s;ed as
an in&s;trument by way of experiment, to &s;ee how much money could, upon
&s;imilar occa&s;ions, be extorted in future:&mdash;for knowing the baronet to 
<PB N="65" REF="67"> be very warm in whatever he e&s;pou&s;ed, the two
pet|ti&s;oggers who were driven from Little Hockley, and a few others who
accompanied them, counted upon a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which they had
no doubt they could procure by rai&s;ing contributions, in like manner, upon
the genero&s;ity of Sir Sidney.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE SEQUEL OF SWASH AND THE TAYLOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The difficulty &s;eemed to be how to &s;uppre&s;s the evidence
of the taylor without Sir Sidney's apparent concurrence; for it was not enough
that he &s;hould not &s;eem to take any active part in the bu&s;ine&s;s, but it
was nece&s;&s;ary to regard it as a matter of perfect indifference to him.</P>
<P>On this account, it was nece&s;&s;ary to be very wary in their
mea&s;ures. Charles and Figgins, how|ever, undertook, after a very little
reflection, to re|move all difficulties.</P>
<P>The plan was explained, and greatly approved; and now came the
time to put it in execution.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e was taken about three miles from War|wick, whither
Charles, Figgins, and the body of arts repaired; which la&s;t were informed
that the <PB N="67" REF="69"> removal was only temporary, to take views, and
at|tend the a&s;&s;emblies at the a&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>About a month before the a&s;&s;izes, Charles and Fig|gins rode
to Wellingborough. The latter having pre|viou&s;ly rolled his coat in the road,
and &s;pla&s;hed his hor&s;e on one &s;ide, they went to the fir&s;t inn they
&s;aw, where they enquired if there was a clever tay|lor in town, who could
make a coat at a &s;hort warning. The landlord recommended one, but not the man
they wanted; but, rather than make ob|jections, they determined to &s;ee him,
and when he came found fault with every thing he produced: which indeed they
were determined to do with fifty, till they &s;hould &s;ee the object of their
pre&s;ent bu&s;i|ne&s;s. At length he came, and there never was &s;uch a
taylor! They were &s;truck with his ta&s;te, his manner, his price:&mdash;In
&s;hort, the poor devil was in raptures, though a man mu&s;t have been very
ingenious to find language for this lavi&s;h prai&s;e in favour of a card of
buttons, and &s;ome &s;nips of cloth. So it was however, that the taylor never
found out half &s;o much merit in him&s;elf as at that moment. He made his men
&s;it up all night, and a very awk|ward coat was produced in the morning for
Fig|gins, which, neverthele&s;s, was the pink of ta&s;te, and the extreme of
the new fa&s;hion; and Charles pre|tended to be &s;o much in love with it, that
he ordered <PB N="68" REF="70"> a frock for him&s;elf, with the addition of a
new Bir|mingham button, with which he declared him&s;elf enchanted. This frock
however he could not &s;tay for. It was therefore ordered to be &s;ent to the
hou&s;e of the Rev. Mr. Figgins, near Warwick, where it would be paid for on
delivery.</P>
<P>The taylor &s;aid he &s;hould be at Warwick at the a&s;&s;izes,
for he was &s;ubpoened there upon a trial, and he would then, if the gentleman
plea&s;ed, take the liberty of calling, to &s;ee if he was &s;atisfied with his
coat.</P>
<P>Figgins &s;aid he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee him, for that
he knew no character &s;o re&s;pectable as a trade&s;man. This was &s;aid as
they took hor&s;e, and the taylor, making a very low bow, retired. The
circum&s;tance was however &s;o &s;ingular, that the landlord, as well as the
taylor's wife, &s;et down Charles and Figgins for two cheats, and cautioned the
taylor not to be taken in.</P>
<P>The taylor had him&s;elf &s;ome &s;u&s;picions akin to theirs,
though the flattery that had been lavi&s;hed on him almo&s;t overcame his
warine&s;s. However, to make all &s;ure, as he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at
Warwick,&mdash;indeed no other than to con his le&s;&s;on as to his evi|dence 
<PB N="69" REF="71"> again&s;t Swa&s;h&mdash;he took that opportunity of
carrying home the coat him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Mr. Figgins's, he was very kindly welcomed,
detained all night, paid his bill, and informed that more clothes would be
&s;ent for, to be got ready again&s;t the a&s;&s;ize ball; to which our hero
added, 
<Q REND="inline">'I wi&s;h we could prevail on you, &s;ir, to
&s;ettle here, for there is not one of your profe&s;&s;ion within twenty miles
who knows even how to &s;et on a button with ta&s;te.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor acceeded to the fact, took a comforta|ble portion of
merit to him&s;elf, and went home in high &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Swa&s;h was to be tried on the la&s;t day of the a&s;&s;izes, on
the motion of the coun&s;el, and three days previ|ous to the trial an order was
&s;ent to the taylor from our hero for &s;ome clothes for the a&s;&s;ize ball.
The taylor could not refu&s;e to execute the order, but, neverthele&s;s, very
anxious to be in time for the trial, was determined he would be at Warwick the
night before.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant being di&s;patched to &s;ugge&s;t alterations and
delays, till he &s;hould be detained very late that evening, he at length
arrived, clothes and all, at <PB N="70" REF="72"> Mr. Figgins's, about half an
hour pa&s;t eleven o'clock, mo&s;t exceedingly fatigued.</P>
<P>Figgins took him very cordially by the hand, and led him into a
parlour, where, at near one&mdash;the clocks being put back almo&s;t an
hour&mdash;&s;upper ap|peared. The taylor prote&s;ting he never was &s;o
di&s;|po&s;ed to make a good meal in his life, fell to very heartily. Thus the
time pa&s;&s;ed on till within a quarter of an hour of day light, though by the
clocks&mdash;being once more put back&mdash;the taylor did not believe it &s;o
late by two hours. At length he was led to bed completely drunk. Having &s;lept
till two o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;which will not ap|pear extraordinary if
we con&s;ider his drunkenne&s;s and fatigue&mdash;he awoke, without
recollecting for &s;ome moments where he was. When he felt, how|ever, a fine,
&s;oft, &s;tately bed, he began to have &s;ome faint idea how he came there;
but, as every thing appeared as dark as pitch, he concluded it was in the
middle of the night, and turned to go to &s;leep again; this, after tumbling
and to&s;&s;ing for half an hour, he effected, and taking another pretty good
nap, waked about half an hour pa&s;t &s;ix.</P>
<P>Feeling a violent head-ach, and finding him&s;elf intolerably
hungry, he could not help thinking the night remarkably long. He got out of the
bed, and <PB N="71" REF="73"> groped about for the windows, and having drawn
one of the curtains, opened the &s;hutters, but it was all the &s;ame. He could
not throw up the &s;a&s;h in|deed, owing, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to a mode of
fa&s;tening it, which he did not under&s;tand. He was yet con|vinced, however,
that it was not near day light, and therefore determined to go to bed
again.</P>
<P>In groping out his way, he caught hold of the to&s;&s;el of a
bell, whieh immediately tingled very forcibly. This frightened him out of his
wits.&mdash;How could he apologize in a gentleman's hou&s;e for making &s;uch a
di&s;turbance? After he had been in bed about a quarter of an hour, in anxious
hope that nobody had heard the bell, a &s;ervant came into his room, with a
candle, yawning, &s;tretching, and rubbing his eyes, who a&s;ked him what he
would be plea&s;ed to have.</P>
<P>The taylor begged his pardon a hundred times, for di&s;turbing
him, though it was nearly &s;even in the evening, and a&s;ked what o'clock it
was, and how long it would be till day light?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'O'clock, &s;ir!' &s;aid the &s;ervant, why we
han't a been in bed above a quarter of an hour; I believe there will be a good
three hours yet before the cock crows.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Three hours!' cried the taylor, 'why I never
pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a night in my life! Three hours!&mdash;why I &s;eem as if I
had lain twenty; and then I am &s;o cur&s;ed hungry.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, that is your long jour|ney, &s;ir,' &s;aid
John.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know what the devil it is,' &s;aid the
taylor, 'but could not you, my dear Mr. John, get me a bit of &s;omething for
the tooth?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord love you, no &s;uch thing,' &s;aid John;
'you mu&s;t e'en &s;tay till morning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Morn|ing!' cried the taylor, 'why I &s;hall be
fami&s;hed in three hours; I never had &s;uch a craving in my life.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well,' &s;aid John, 'then I will &s;ee
what I can do; but I mu&s;t get the keys of old Mother Search, the
hou&s;e-keeper, and &s;he is a devil of a cru&s;ty toad, I can tell
you.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor implored him to &s;ee what he could do, and John
&s;aid he would return directly. He did not, however, make his appearance for
another half hour, when he brought word that there was nothing to be had.</P>
<P>This news the taylor was obliged to &s;wallow in|&s;tead of the
repa&s;t he had expected, and wi&s;hing John a good night, endeavoured once
more to get to &s;leep. This however was impo&s;&s;ible; he kicked about,
turned, twi&s;ted, got up, lay down, and be|tween whiles, fell into a kind of
do&s;e, till night <PB N="73" REF="75"> actually came. His patience was now
entirely ex|hau&s;ted, and, for the fir&s;t time, he &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome
trick had been played him. The whole con|duct of this family had been &s;o
extraordinary, that he began now to reflect on his neighbours' &s;u&s;pi|cions;
but then, how could that apply to him?&mdash;he had nothing to be robbed of.
They might mur|der him, however, but what harm had he done to any body? Perhaps
it was all a drunken frolic:&mdash;perhaps it was day-light all this time.
Whatever it was, he might be &s;ure no &s;ervant would &s;et him right; he was
therefore determined to &s;ally forth, and know the truth of every thing.</P>
<P>So re&s;olved, he immediately put on his clothes, and groping
out the door, met with no impediment all the way to the garden, where, by
feeling about, he &s;oon found him&s;elf. Here he gave that credit to the
&s;tars which he denied to John, and being now convinced his brain was
affected, he thought he could not do better than return, without giving any
further di&s;turbance to the family. This, however, was not &s;o ea&s;ily
practicable as he imagined. The door had &s;hut after him in &s;uch a manner,
that he found it out of his power to open it.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation was now truly deplorable. He dur&s;t not knock,
for fear of making more di&s;turbance in <PB N="74" REF="76"> the hou&s;e. In
the mean time he was devoured with hunger, and being in a &s;trange place, in
the night, his fancy transformed every bu&s;h, not into an offi|cer, but a
gho&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e apprehen&s;ions were not a little heightened by a
variety of noi&s;es, which now a&s;&s;ailed his ears. Clanking of chains,
groans, and howls fixed him petrified to the &s;pot, while &s;trange lights,
which came and di&s;appeared, added not a little to the hor|rid workings of his
teeming fancy. At length &s;ome|thing tapped him upon the &s;houlder, when
turning round in an agony of fear, he &s;aw, as plain as ever he did any thing
in his life, John Swa&s;h &s;taring him in the face. What at this moment were
the poor taylor's &s;en&s;ations! He &s;queaked, kicked, plunged, without being
able to take his eyes from this dread|ful object, till pre&s;ently his &s;ight
failed him, his mu&s;cles were all relaxed, and he mea&s;ured his length on the
ground.</P>
<P>A few tweaks by the no&s;e and &s;ome cold water brought him a
little to him&s;elf, when he found John and another &s;ervant lifting him up.
This circum|&s;tance did not a little facilitate his recovery. The moment he
got the u&s;e of his &s;peech, he cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'For the love of God, dear chri&s;tian
gentlemen, &s;peak to me! Oh Lord, is he gone? Did you <PB N="75" REF="77">
&s;ee him? Oh dear, dear, dear, dear&mdash;there he comes again! Hold me
fa&s;t!&mdash;don't let him fly away with me!'</Q></P>
<P>John and his fellow &s;ervant had &s;ome difficulty to comply
with his reque&s;t, he &s;truggled &s;o hard, for fear gave him the &s;trength
of a giant.</P>
<P>The &s;pectre approaching, the taylor's fear, or rather horror,
was beyond de&s;cription 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' cried he, 'Don't you &s;ee it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'See what?' &s;aid John, 'I &s;ee nothing but
the trees and the &s;tars, do you Thomas?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not I,' &s;aid Thomas.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come, &s;ir, doo ey goo to bed&mdash;yow
han not a &s;lept to night. When the woine a be got out of your head, yowl be
in your right wits, like a &s;ober par&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>The gho&s;t now began to &s;peak. 
<Q REND="inline">'Hu&s;h, hu&s;h,' cried the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord have mercy upon me, &s;ave and deliver
me. It &s;peaks! Oh John Swa&s;h, John Swa&s;h, how have I offended
thee?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh mi&s;erable taylor, li&s;ten to me,' &s;aid
the gho&s;t.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will John indeed,' &s;aid the poor
terror-&s;truck wretch,</Q> and now the gho&s;t went on.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For the lucre of gain thou did&s;t try to hang
me. <PB N="76" REF="78"> though well thou knowe&s;t I never did thee harm; but
I have e&s;caped thy malice, for rather than bring di&s;grace upon my poor wife
and family, I made away with my&s;elf. Now if thou wi&s;he&s;t to &s;leep
peaceably in thy bed, make a full confe&s;&s;ion of thy wickedne&s;s to Sir
Sidney Roebuck, and through him re&s;tore to my unhappy family that money which
thou ha&s;t at different times frigh|tened me out of. Remember, and let not my
an|gry &s;pirit vi&s;it thee a &s;econd time.'</Q> So &s;aying, the gho&s;t
di&s;appeared.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord have mercy, &s;ave, deliver, and forgive
my &s;ins,' &s;aid the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What d'ye toak a|bout?' &s;aid Thomas.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pardon a poor, wretched, mi&s;erable &s;inner,'
exclaimed the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come,' &s;aid John, 'it will be time
enough to &s;ay your prayers when you are up in your room.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How can you be &s;o bla&s;phemous?' &s;aid the
taylor, 'did not you hear what he &s;aid?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who? Who?' cried John.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why the man's out of his wits.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who!' exclaimed Snip, 'why poor John Swa&s;h; I
have killed, I have murdered him, and his blood will be on my hands.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried Thomas, 'the&s;e be odd
&s;ort of &s;peeches; I do not wonder yow be troubled in mind, if yow a done
&s;uch wicked things as the&s;e:&mdash;but coom, yow be only a &s;leep, and a
dreaming.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79"> In &s;hort, the trembling taylor was at
la&s;t con|veyed to his room, where he lay &s;weating and &s;hi|vering, and
almo&s;t &s;uffocated under the clothes, till day-light.</P>
<P>He now got up, and &s;aying his prayers longer and louder than
ever he had done in his life, he be|gan, though &s;till in bodily fear, to
con&s;ider how he &s;hould prevent a &s;econd vi&s;it from the gho&s;t. As
however the family was not yet &s;tirring, and he thought he had made pretty
&s;ufficient di&s;turbance in it already, he returned once more to bed, where,
having undergone &s;o much mental and corporeal fatigue, he fell into a &s;ound
&s;leep, which probably &s;aved him from a &s;evere fit of &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>The reader has &s;een that the windows had been purpo&s;ely
blocked up, on the fir&s;t night, on the out &s;ide, to cheat the taylor,
through the whole of that day, into a belief that it was not yet light; by
which means the trial of Swa&s;h came on, and he was ac|quitted for want of
evidence; for as to the confede|rate, Figgins had &s;een, and &s;o completely
intimi|dated him, with threatening to lay a detainer again&s;t him on another
&s;core, that he purpo&s;ely prevaricated on the trial, and the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as frivolous and vexatious. The noi&s;e which
the taylor heard when he was in the garden, and which <PB N="78" REF="80"> his
fears had &s;o greatly magnified, was nothing more than the taking down the
blinds, which, as I have &s;aid, on the out&s;ide were affixed to the
windows.&mdash;But the gho&s;t was no other than the individual John Swa&s;h,
who had been relea&s;ed in the afternoon, and properly tutored for the
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The taylor, at the proper time, was &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t in
the parlour, where he was kindly re|ceived by Mr. Figgins and Charles, as well
as the poet and the mu&s;ician:&mdash;the painter being gone to take a walk.
They informed him they were ex|tremely &s;orry to hear he had been &s;o ill in
the night, and the poet, pretending to know &s;omething of phy&s;ic, felt his
pul&s;e, which having done very grave|ly, he declared that the gentleman was
not &s;o ill in body as that he was troubled with thick-coming fancies that
di&s;turbed his re&s;t.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That's very true, &s;ir,' &s;aid the taylor,
'you have found out my di&s;order at once.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well but can't you cure him of that?' &s;aid
Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No,' an&s;wered the poet gravely, 'in that
ca&s;e the pa|tient mu&s;t admini&s;ter unto him&s;elf.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank you &s;ir,' &s;aid the taylor; 'it is
very true&mdash;he mu&s;t indeed&mdash;and &s;o I will, if it &s;hall plea&s;e
God, be|fore I am many hours older.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"> 
<Q REND="inline">'You &s;ee, you &s;ee,' &s;aid the poet, 'I know
all the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order. You are very hungry &s;ir, are you
not?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes &s;ir,' &s;aid the taylor, 'I dare &s;ay I
could eat a &s;houlder of mutton, and look round me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A bad &s;ymptom, &s;ir,' &s;aid the poet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pooh, pooh,' cried Charles, 'I will never
believe that a hungry &s;ick man is in much danger. Come John, let us have the
breakfa&s;t, the gentle|man will be too late for the trial.'</Q> Then
addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf to the taylor: 
<Q REND="inline">'When do you expect it to come on &s;ir? I hope
you will convict the ra&s;|cal; for really times are come to &s;uch a pa&s;s
that an hone&s;t man cannot keep his property in &s;afety.'</Q></P>
<P> The taylor's countenance underwent &s;everal alte|rations, and
he faultered out, 
<Q REND="inline">'why &s;ir I don't think it will come on at
all.'</Q> Here John came in with a &s;moaking plate of toa&s;t. 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, let us fall to,'</Q> &s;aid Charles. 
<Q REND="inline">'Come &s;ir, help your|&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor began to put a piece to his mouth, when in came the
painter. 
<Q REND="inline">'Your &s;ervant,' &s;aid Figgins, 'where have
you been this morning?'&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' &s;aid Mu&s;quito, 'I have been to
&s;ee a very unplea&s;ant &s;pectacle, I a&s;&s;ure you. A poor fellow, one
Swa&s;h, who was to have been tried this morn|ing <PB N="80" REF="82"> for
&s;heep-&s;tealing, poi&s;oned him&s;elf la&s;t night in his cell, and, through
the intere&s;t of Sir Sid|ney Roebuck, the coroner's verdict was returned
lunacy, and they are now carrying the body to his wife and children.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the tea and toa&s;t dropt out of the taylor's hand, and he
entreated, for the love of God, that he might be conducted to that very Sir
Sidney Roebuck, for he could not eat nor &s;leep before he di&s;burthened his
con&s;cience of &s;omething that lay very heavy on it.</P>
<P>Every one affected extraordinary &s;urpri&s;e at this
declaration; after which, Mr. Figgins &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, I am a clergyman, and if I can do you any
&s;ervice by hearing your confe&s;&s;ion, and giving you &s;alutary advice, I
will do it with plea&s;ure.'</Q> To which the terrified taylor&mdash;looking
about him&mdash;&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'No &s;ir, that won't do; I am afraid he will
appear again if I tell it to any body but Sir Sidney.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Appear!' &s;aid Charles, 'Who? Who will
ap|pear?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'The gho&s;t &s;ir, the gho&s;t!' &s;aid the
tay|lor; 'John Swa&s;h's gho&s;t!'</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman now de&s;ired to &s;peak with Mr. Fig|gins, who
being u&s;hered in, proved to be Sir Sid|ney.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"> The moment the taylor &s;aw him, he fell
upon his knees, and cried out 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh dear &s;ir forgive me.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Forgive you!' &s;aid Sir Sidney, 'why who are
you?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid he, 'I am the taylor, the wicked
taylor that tried to hang John Swa&s;h.'</Q></P>
<P>The baronet was then informed of all the gho&s;t enjoined Snip,
and at length, on his earne&s;t entreaty, went apart with him to make an ample
confe&s;&s;ion. This indeed amounted to nothing criminal in the taylor, except
the extortion of the money; but it laid up &s;uch a body of evidence again&s;t
the emi|grants from Little Hockley, as the baronet had no doubt would put a
&s;top to their nefarious attempts for the future.</P>
<P>The taylor's confe&s;&s;ion being &s;igned and &s;worn to, he
was permitted to eat a voracious breakfa&s;t with John, for nothing after this
could prevail on him to come into the parlour.</P>
<P>A large cavalcade now appeared in the road, which poor Snip, as
well as every body el&s;e, knew to be the judges, who were leaving Warwick to
open the a&s;&s;izes at Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>The taylor, though no great conjuror, &s;aw plain|ly he had been
tricked. He now neither wondered <PB N="82" REF="84"> at his
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s nor his hunger, and le&s;t he &s;hould any longer remain
in doubt, John Swa&s;h him&s;elf&mdash;who &s;oftly entered the
kitchen&mdash;tapped him upon the &s;houlder once more, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Ma&s;ter Cabbage, you have twice taken me for a
gho&s;t, beware of the third time.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor received a very whole&s;ome admonition from Sir
Sidney, who explained to him in very pa|thetic terms, the cruelty and wanton
maliciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;turbing the quiet of a man and his family, who, he
&s;aid, were objects of great compa&s;&s;ion, as well as prai&s;e; for there
were very few in&s;tances of tho&s;e who had &s;o given them&s;elves up to bad
exam|ple, as to have been guilty of every wickedne&s;s and depravity, and
afterwards de&s;irous of returning from their vicious cour&s;es. He &s;aid
there was no encouragement to which &s;uch objects were not en|titled. How
reprehen&s;ible then was it in tho&s;e who waited for the moment when &s;uch
&s;hould return to virtue, and, in con&s;equence of their hone&s;t in|du&s;try,
become in tolerable circum&s;tances, to &s;eek for opportunities to
di&s;tre&s;s and harra&s;s them, and &s;o prevent the happy effects of their
laudable and hone&s;t endeavours.</P>
<P>As for the taylor, he told him he was well con|vinced he had
been &s;et on by others, and as he had <PB N="83" REF="85"> now made a candid
and fair confe&s;&s;ion relative to all tho&s;e dark con&s;piracies which he
plainly &s;aw were levelled again&s;t the&s;e poor repentant &s;inners, if he
would go on a little further, and join with him in detecting this knot of
villains, he might rely upon his favour; and he would enjoy a much higher
&s;atisfaction&mdash;that of di&s;charging his duty as an ho|ne&s;t man.</P>
<P>The taylor was &s;uffered to depart, after faithfully
promi&s;ing all that had been enjoined him, and Sir Sidney was, for the fir&s;t
time, let into the whole of the my&s;tery by which the taylor had been
prevented from appearing at the trial; for it mu&s;t be under|&s;tood that Sir
Sidney knew the taylor was to be kept away, but he did not know in what
manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A NEW CURE FOR AN AMOROUS FEVER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE hou&s;ekeeping of Mr. Figgins, near War|wick, being now
broken up, Charles and his friend returned to Hazard hou&s;e, and Mu&s;quito,
Ego, and Toogood to Roebuck hall.</P>
<P>Charles had noticed that Mu&s;quito, in con&s;e|quence of his
&s;atiric vein, had conceived him&s;elf a kind of &s;uperior to his two
companions; for when|ever it came up in conver&s;ation that they had been
ridiculed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the gho&s;t, he took care &s;agaciou&s;ly to
hint that no one dared play him &s;uch a trick.</P>
<P>Our hero was therefore determined to leave him no room for
exultation, e&s;pecially as by the mode through which he intended to &s;hew him
off, as well as the re&s;t, he &s;hould do even a more meritorious act than he
had done in &s;aving Emma from the per&s;ecutions of the poet and the
mu&s;ician. This method of &s;tudying mi&s;chief, only by way of in|flicting 
<PB N="85" REF="87"> merited puni&s;hment, was a &s;pecies of amu&s;e|ment in
which it has been &s;een our hero delighted. It certainly was highly
prai&s;eworthy in one &s;en&s;e, for it turned every thing off with a laugh
only again&s;t the offender, whereas, had it been &s;haped into a complaint,
and preferred again&s;t him to Sir Sidney, it might have endangered the hopes
which he built on his patronage.</P>
<P>John Swa&s;h had a daughter, who mu&s;t have had an uncommon
mind for her &s;ituation in life; for, from her earlie&s;t infancy, &s;he was
remarked to have had a dete&s;tation to that vice which &s;urrounded her. She
profitted by avoiding bad examples as much as others by imitating good ones. In
&s;hort&mdash;which is the &s;tronge&s;t proof that can be given of the
excel|lence of her heart, and the incorruptibility of her honour, &s;he, at
eighteen, was as &s;potle&s;s a character at Little Hockley, as the mo&s;t
innocent inhabitant of her age and &s;ex could be at Ca&s;tlewick.</P>
<P>The painter had long laid &s;iege to this young creature, who
had all that beauty which regular features, ro&s;y health, and a perfect
&s;ymmetry of form can give. He drew her likene&s;s, and took care it &s;hould
be a flattering one. He took a &s;ketch of the mill, and made it a pre&s;ent to
Swa&s;h, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional pride was thus tickled. He painted a 
<PB N="86" REF="88"> favourite tortoi&s;e&s;hell cat for the mother, and, in a
variety of other in&s;tances, made his talents &s;ub&s;er|vient to his
wi&s;hes; but, in particular, he vaunted that he had been the principal
in&s;trument in de|taining the taylor from appearing at the trial.</P>
<P>I know not if the girl's gratitude on the &s;ide of her duty
pleaded in his favour, or whether nature began to whi&s;per to her that, good
as &s;he was, love&mdash;as &s;omebody has expre&s;&s;ed it&mdash;is the
&s;overeign end of our being; but certainly &s;he began to li&s;ten to the
painter's conver&s;ation with plea&s;ure, and as &s;he had never in her life
been controlled, &s;crupled not to walk with him in an evening. She &s;oon,
however, repented of her complai&s;ance, and was almo&s;t fatally convinced on
what terms the&s;e oppor|tunities were reque&s;ted. She re&s;ented his
in&s;olence, which was manuel as well as verbal, and without ceremony informed
her mother of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, who, good woman, I am &s;orry to &s;ay
it, did not make &s;uch forcible objections to it as the daughter did. To &s;ay
the truth, &s;he had a large fa|mily, and looked upon her daughters as much in
the light of traffic, as her barley meal. In &s;hort, won by a hand&s;ome
&s;um, a promi&s;e of painting her picture in the attitude of milking a
favourite cow, and a half anker of genuine nantz&mdash;with &s;hame I write
it&mdash;after but little he&s;itation, &s;he agreed to <PB N="87" REF="89">
this method of providing for her girl as &s;he called it.</P>
<P>This good woman, in her youth, had been toler|ably hand&s;ome
her&s;elf. Ma&s;ter Flu&s;h had been heard to intimate that he fancied the
governor&mdash;meaning Standfa&s;t&mdash;had taken care to provide a birth in
heaven for Ma&s;ter Swa&s;h, in the month of April; but I am afraid nobody had
&s;o &s;trong a claim to that favour as Lord Hazard.</P>
<P>Charles had eyed this girl with plea&s;ure, but would not for
the univer&s;e have given way to the &s;hadow of an impul&s;e to her
di&s;honour. And here it may not be ami&s;s to beg the reader will &s;top with
me, and admire how greatly to our own advantage we take re&s;olutions which are
in favour of virtue; for it is within po&s;&s;ibility that, had our hero given
way to an inclination natural enough for a youth of warm blood to entertain,
and I hope full as natural if there were any thing like honour in his
di&s;po&s;ition, to conquer&mdash;hear it ye &s;educers of virtue! Ye
mercile&s;s triumphant de&s;poilers of innocence! who are cruel becau&s;e you
have power!&mdash;in&s;olent be|cau&s;e victorious!&mdash;hear it, and reflect
with horror on the mi&s;eries that to often re&s;ult from your vices,&mdash;he
might have contaminated a &s;i&s;ter!!</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"> From &s;o deplorable a crime, however
uninten|tional, did Charles, by his per&s;everance in his ho|nourable
re&s;olutions, very probably e&s;cape; for he, by his frequent chat with this
girl, had taught her bo&s;om to glow with tenderne&s;s, but having put the
curb, as we have &s;een, upon his wi&s;hes, and cea&s;ed to be particular from
the moment he was apprehen|&s;ive of danger&mdash;during which interval the
painter &s;tept in&mdash;&s;he found &s;ome plea&s;ure, which the reader may be
a&s;&s;ured is not unnatural, in li&s;tening to lan|guage of the &s;ame kind
from another, even though it was not &s;o eloquently worded, or &s;o gracefully
delivered.</P>
<P>As Charles withdrew his attention from this girl upon a ground
for which &s;he loved him &s;till more&mdash;for he made no &s;cruple of
confe&s;&s;ing the truth&mdash;the poor girl having been repul&s;ed by her
mother, as we have &s;een, or rather encouraged to make her fortune, according
to the old gentlewoman, by that which, according to any body el&s;e, would have
been her ruin, was walking &s;olitary and unhappy by the &s;ide of her father's
mill-&s;tream, when Figgins and our hero pa&s;&s;ed by. Charles &s;aw the
pearly tear &s;tanding on her cheek, and very good naturedly enquired the
cau&s;e. After a little reluctance &s;he informed him, and concluded her
artle&s;sly pathetic <PB N="89" REF="91"> &s;tory with &s;aying 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed it is a &s;ad thing when a poor girl's
mother bids her to be wicked; but I won't be wicked, if I am ever &s;o
undutiful I won't.'</Q></P>
<P>Both Charles and Figgins commended her laudable re&s;olution,
and now occurred an admirable oppor|tunity of puni&s;hing the painter in his
own way. He immediately told the girl of his intention; to for|ward which,
&s;he was de&s;ired to acquaint her mo|ther that &s;he would be a good girl,
and behave civil to the gentleman, and, when he came, &s;he &s;hould make him
an appointment in the du&s;k of the even|ing in the bed chamber; that he would
let her father privately into the &s;ecret, who &s;hould, in concert with them,
&s;o revenge him&s;elf upon her audacious lover, as to leave him very little
reli&s;h for &s;uch a|mu&s;ement in future.</P>
<P>The girl was charmed to find her cau&s;e taken up &s;o warmly by
our hero, for &s;he knew, let what would happen, the painter mu&s;t not dare to
com|plain.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ignation was made, and Swa&s;h apprized of the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s. The painter, as may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, attended
punctually, and the hu&s;band being, as it was imagined, &s;afe at the ale
hou&s;e, the <PB N="90" REF="92"> amorous Appelles was conducted to the young
lady's bed chamber, by her accommodating mamma, and de&s;ired to go to bed,
where he &s;hould be made as happy as he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>He had not lain long in this &s;ituation, before he heard a foot
upon the &s;tairs, when immediately his heart beat high, his fancy anticipated
the expected plea&s;ure, and all his &s;en&s;es were in an alarm; but, however,
all the&s;e were nothing to the alarm that pre&s;ently followed. In
ru&s;hed&mdash;at lea&s;t his fears made him believe &s;o&mdash;half a dozen
myrmidons; pop half a dozen times went half a dozen pi&s;tols; the fir&s;t of
which was a &s;ufficient intimation that the &s;alute had very little of love
in it. Indeed he won|dered how it came that he was not a dead man, for his
fears had wounded him in twenty places.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t of the&s;e hints he took, and darting out of
the foot of the bed, he pre&s;ently cleared the landing place, and gained the
bottom of the &s;tairs; by which time he received a few more compliments of the
&s;ame kind. The&s;e, however, though they were unnece&s;&s;ary to refre&s;h
his memory, ha&s;tened his departure, which he took without paying the
&s;malle&s;t compliment to any of the family, but ru&s;h|ing out at the
&s;treet door, made his way acro&s;s a paddock, which led to the road; his
pur&s;uers &s;till <PB N="91" REF="93"> popping at &s;uch a rate, that he
verily believed he was flying from a whole platoon.</P>
<P>Being come to a bank, he collected his whole might to jump over
the hedge, into the road, but the di&s;tance being greater than he imagined, he
plunged, with all his force, naked as he was, into a bramble bu&s;h, which
clinging in a hundred places to his &s;hirt, and in as many to his fle&s;h,
pinned him down &s;o firmly, that he was obliged to make &s;everal excruciating
efforts to free him&s;elf. He did &s;o how|ever at la&s;t, but finding
him&s;elf &s;urrounded with enemies, who were &s;till popping at him, he
doubled as artfully as any Jack hare, and was followed as clo&s;ely, with this
difference, that the game opened in&s;tead of the pack; for he yelped, howled,
&s;wore, ejaculated, cur&s;ed, and prayed, in &s;uch a &s;trange collection of
hy&s;terical tones, that the mu&s;ician, who was then pre&s;ent, had as much
rea&s;on to be enraged as Hogarth's, for all the complicated din there
de&s;|cribed, &s;eemed to be centured in one per&s;on.</P>
<P>This di&s;cordance however did not la&s;t long, for trying to
cro&s;s the mill &s;tream by a bridge, which to be &s;ure had been laid down an
hour before, but was now drawn up, poor Mu&s;quito came &s;ou&s;e over head and
ears into the water, which being in that part pretty deep, would have cooled
him for in|triguing, <PB N="92" REF="94"> and every thing el&s;e in this world,
had not a large fi&s;hing net been previou&s;ly placed to receive him.</P>
<P>The net was immediately drawn up, which, with all the ha&s;te
they could make however, was not ef|fected before the poor painter had totally
lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>He was now put into a &s;hell, and the church being near,
carried to the bone hou&s;e, where being held up by the heels, a quantity of
water ran out of his mouth, and he pre&s;ently exhibited &s;igns of life. The
moment this event took place, they hurried off with the lanthorn&mdash;the only
light they had&mdash;and the &s;exton, who, being a friend to the miller,
connived at the trick, immediately returned with his mattock and &s;hovel on
his &s;houlder.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' &s;aid he, as if to him&s;elf, 'that
job's done.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh d d d d dear,' cried the painter,</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is odd there &s;hould be nobody to own the
man,' cried the &s;exton, putting down his things.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'B b b oh&mdash;ah&mdash;oh&mdash;' cried the
painter.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I have made him a good grave, however,' cried
the &s;exton, 'and as &s;oon as the coroner's que&s;t has &s;at upon
him&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95"> The painter now mu&s;tered &s;trength
enough to &s;it up, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh d d d d dear&mdash;f f f f
friend.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord, what's that!' &s;aid the &s;exton.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh f f f f for the love of God help me,' cried
Mu&s;quito.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why lookee now,' &s;aid the &s;exton, 'here's
my man come to life. Lie down now doey; lie down, I ha been ju&s;t making your
grave.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord,' exclaimed the painter, 'my g g g g
grave!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay ay, nobody will own you, you &s;ee, and &s;o
we &s;hall bury you to-morrow morning.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bury me!' cried the painter, who had by this
time got out of the &s;hell. 'Oh Chri&s;t, where am I brought to?'&mdash;then
looking round him&mdash;'Oh, dear friend have pity upon me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried the &s;exton, 'don't come
nigh me; I never could abide a dead body in my life, unle&s;s in the way of
bu&s;ine&s;s, and when it was &s;crewed up, as a body may &s;ay: &s;o don't
come nigh me.'</Q></P>
<P>The painter told him he was alive, the &s;exton &s;aid he was a
damned liar, and took up the lanthorn to be gone: the painter followed: the
&s;exton hol|howing out 
<Q REND="inline">'the devil take the hindmo&s;t.'</Q> At length,
turning round a corner of the church, he blew out the candle, &s;lipt away, and
the painter found him&s;elf alone, &s;ore from head to foot, wet and naked, in
the middle of a church yard, above <PB N="94" REF="96"> two miles from Sir
Sidney's, at half an hour pa&s;t ten o'clock at night.</P>
<P>In this condition he po&s;ted to the alehou&s;e, where he
intended to have trumped up a &s;tory of his being robbed, but his old friend
the &s;exton being the fir&s;t man he &s;aw in the room, he only de&s;ired the
u&s;e of &s;ome clothes, for which he &s;aid he would &s;atisfy them
hand&s;omely.</P>
<P>The man of the hou&s;e agreed to accommodate him, and fetched
&s;ome things for that purpo&s;e, which Mu&s;quito put on before the fire; for
the landlady was gone to bed. In the mean time the gue&s;ts were not &s;paring
of their jokes. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ble&s;s me,' &s;aid one, 'the gentleman has
been &s;adly mauled with zummet! He looks as if he had tumbled into a hornet's

<P>The painter did not reply a &s;ingle word to all this wit; but,
having hurried on the landlord's clothes, and &s;aid he would return them in
the morning, and &s;atisfy him for his trouble, he &s;neaked to Sir Sid|ney's,
and &s;kulked up &s;tairs to bed.</P>
<P>Charles and Figgins came in the morning to breakfa&s;t. Every
body was very inqui&s;itive to know how it happened that the painter had not
&s;upped at home. One &s;aid &s;ignificantly he was perhaps better engaged;
another, that whatever his amu&s;ement was, he hoped it was to his liking. In
&s;hort, the poor painter was hand&s;omely played off. At la&s;t it came to Sir
Sidney's turn, who &s;aid hone&s;t Swa&s;h had been with him that morning about
an affair &s;omething in the &s;tyle of the &s;oldier and the king of
France:&mdash;the &s;oldier craved pardon for having thrown a man's hat out of
window, and, having ob|tained it, &s;aid he had thrown his head out too.</P>
<P>Here Sir Sidney related the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the preceding
evening, as indeed he had heard it from Charles, not from Swa&s;h. He concealed
his know|ledge of the gallant, who, he &s;aid, was rightly &s;erved, and he
only wi&s;hed the next time the gentleman, <PB N="96" REF="98"> whoever he was,
took it into his head to corrupt innocence and de&s;troy dome&s;tic peace, he
would never after having done &s;o pre&s;ume to come into his pre&s;ence. He
concluded with reprobating the con|duct of the mother, and heartily
recommending the girl to Lady Roebuck's notice, who declared, as Emma was in
want of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;he &s;hould be im|mediately placed about the
per&s;on of Annette.</P>

<PB REF="99">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE READER IS ATTACKED ON THE SIDE OF HIS
SENSIBILITY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT never, for a &s;ingle moment, occurred to Charles that he had
wrought an event mo&s;t wonderfully in his own favour by thus puni&s;hing the
painter; for Jude&mdash;&s;o was the miller's daughter called&mdash;rang the
changes in his prai&s;e &s;o continually, that, as her voice was the voice of
nature, and her &s;entiments &s;trong genuine gratitude, his cau&s;e could not
even in Emma have had half &s;o powerful an advocate: nay with Emma
her&s;elf:&mdash;for though &s;he was well enough plea&s;ed that the youth had
conceived favour|able thoughts of her, though &s;he admired the ready
willingne&s;s with which he had corrected his error, yet there was, with her, a
di&s;tinct difference in the two ca&s;es. As to her&s;elf, &s;he was a ho&s;t
alone; &s;he defied temptation; and, to &s;uch a youth as Charles, &s;he was
rather plea&s;ed than concerned that &s;he had had an opportunity of &s;hewing
upon what erroneous ground he began his career, and what certain mi|&s;ery
would be the con&s;equence of his per&s;uting in <PB N="98" REF="100">
indi&s;criminate pur&s;uits, in which he might be a&s;|&s;ured, though he would
often dupe others, he would oftener be duped him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Emma repre&s;ented to him that the &s;en&s;ations of a tender
and &s;u&s;ceptible heart, which had given a &s;in|gle pang to &s;uffering
virtue, mu&s;t be intolerable; and therefore conjured him to cea&s;e from a
conduct which was fooli&s;h as well as wicked, impolitic as well as unworthy;
for it was a barter of virtue for infamy, tran&s;ient plea&s;ure for la&s;ting
pain: and however con&s;onant to the boi&s;terous and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions of
youth, would, throughout his life, be over&s;hadowed by a cloud of
wretchedne&s;s, which the &s;plendour of rank and di&s;tinction would vainly
&s;truggle to di&s;&s;ipate.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, this incident had touched Emma in the right
key; for if &s;he gave Charles credit for his delicate and honourable treatment
of Jude, how much then was due to her admonitions which pro|duced it?</P>
<P>If Emma had a weak &s;ide, certainly this was it. She was
perfectly a &s;chemer on the &s;ide of virtue, and thought the pa&s;&s;ions
might be bottled up, like the winds of Aeolus; forgetting that there never
wants curious and turbulent &s;pirits to let them out, <PB N="99" REF="101">
not only to excite fre&s;h dangers, but make the ca&s;e wor&s;e, by leaving no
remedy.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, nothing could be purer than poor Emma's
intentions, which, though they were not always infallible, hit nine times out
of ten as &s;he wi&s;hed they &s;hould. Here it was impo&s;&s;ible they
&s;hould mi&s;s. Standfa&s;t indeed, had he &s;o far con|de&s;cended, would
have at plea&s;ure changed the form of every one of them; and, &s;pight of
Emma's pene|tration, have &s;hewn them, even to her, &s;o deformed that &s;he
&s;hould &s;carcely have known them for her own.</P>
<P>This gentleman, however, &s;eems to be meditat|ing at a
di&s;tance; and, as the cour&s;e is left free for youth, &s;weetne&s;s, good
nature, and ingenuity to pay their open court to beauty, mode&s;ty, and
delicate &s;en&s;ibility, no wonder if, &s;anctioned by parents, &s;trongly
&s;upported by irre&s;i&s;tible advocates, and their mutual wi&s;hes being in
their e&s;&s;ence eminently congenial, a &s;trong, and, one would think,
indi&s;&s;o|luble compact mu&s;t naturally be formed between Charles and
Annette.</P>
<P>To &s;peak plain, which I, as well as Emma, think the be&s;t
way, &s;o many were the de&s;irable ends an union between this amiable couple
promi&s;ed to ae|compli&s;h, <PB N="100" REF="102"> that, had it not been for
their youth&mdash;though probably they would not have found that an
objection&mdash;neither them&s;elves, the fathers and mo|thers, connections and
dependants, the two villages of Ca&s;tlewick and Little Hockley&mdash;for
Little Hock|ley was really now ri&s;ing into &s;ame, in &s;pight of Mrs.
Swa&s;h and her unworthy propen&s;ities, for which, between the reader and I,
&s;he got well thra&s;hed by her hu&s;band&mdash;not one of the&s;e I &s;ay but
would have ble&s;&s;ed the day which united this lovely pair, and, what to
&s;ome of them would not have been an un|welcome object, have produced an
extraordinary grand fea&s;t.</P>
<P>But whether fortune thought with Emma that virtues and
pa&s;&s;ions are given us to be exerci&s;ed and controlled, or whether the
mind, like the con&s;titu|tion, is &s;oberer in its age for having been taken
down in its youth, I &s;hall not pretend to decide here:&mdash;certain it is
that the blind and varying god|de&s;s did not altogether take part with the
friends of our hero and heroine; the rea&s;on why, and the man|ner how, &s;he
thought proper to di&s;&s;ent from this otherwi&s;e unanimous opinion, will
hereafter be gra|dually developed. In the mean time, I am really concerned
that, ju&s;t when we find Charles and An|nette in the full enjoyment of their
friends' admira|tion, and that of one another, I &s;hould be under the 
<PB N="101" REF="103"> unplea&s;ant nece&s;&s;ity of throwing as complete a
damp over all their &s;pirits&mdash;&s;uch a &s;cene of light and dark|ne&s;s
is this life&mdash;as I had before pre&s;ented to them of joy and
exultation.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure the very name of poor Lady Hazard will anticipate
every word of the &s;ad tale it is my un|willing duty to relate. This amiable
lady, this lovely, this fatal &s;acrifice to complicated villany, who&s;e fall
was doomed to tear the heart of him who in early life had departed from the
paths of honour: This charming victim, who it &s;hould &s;eem by an error of
fate received the blow that was meant for her lord:&mdash;But it was no error;
it is blindne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e fate can err; he was to live, that in the
ex|piation of his original guilt, his pangs might tor|ture him with accumulated
keenne&s;s:&mdash;</P>
<P>Sweet Lady Hazard, who had &s;eemed to decline with the
&s;ummer, had been for &s;ome weeks evi|dently ha&s;tening to her
di&s;&s;olution, when at length the &s;olemn &s;entence of the phy&s;icians
precluded all hope. Indeed &s;he felt that a few hours would put a period to
her &s;ufferings, and de&s;ired, with calm re&s;ignation, that &s;he might, for
the la&s;t time, &s;ee her friends about her.</P>
<P>This affecting reque&s;t was &s;oon complied with, 
<PB N="102" REF="104"> for Lady Roebuck had been almo&s;t continually with her
from the moment &s;he was in actual danger, and though our hero and his
companions had, at differ|ent opportunities, employed their time as we have
&s;een, yet the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s of them would at any moment have flown to
have contributed in the &s;lighte&s;t degree to her ea&s;e or comfort. In fact,
&s;he was gliding out of the world by &s;uch imperceptible degrees, that, as
&s;he &s;upported her melancholy &s;itu|ation with wonderful fortitude, there
had ever been, till very lately, &s;ome &s;light hope of her recovery.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard had &s;ome time, by her own parti|cular de&s;ire,
been left alone with his lady. Before however I relate what pa&s;&s;ed at this
affecting inter|view, that I may not improperly interrupt the reader's banquet
of grief&mdash;which by &s;ome is thought to be a very delicious luxury&mdash;I
&s;hall notice, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to heighten the loveline&s;s of Lady
Hazard, and the wretchedne&s;s of her Lord, that, owing to &s;ome
expre&s;&s;ions which fell from the &s;ur|geon, during the operation at the
John of Gaunt&mdash;which I have de&s;cribed as particular as was nece&s;&s;ary
or delicate&mdash;&s;he became acquainted with that &s;ecret which &s;eems to
be &s;et up as a beacon in this hi&s;tory to warn the reader that a very
&s;mall deviation from prudence may plunge a family into irretrievable
mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105"> The interview between Lord and Lady
Hazard was of that affecting kind that at once excites pity and terror. It was
one of tho&s;e moments when the tongue denies relief to the heart, when nature
would &s;ink but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of madne&s;s, and when the
pre&s;&s;ure of calamity numbs the keenne&s;s of its tor|ture.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard, overwhelmed with the recollection of his
unworthine&s;s, and loaded with the &s;elf-re|proaching con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
his guilt, lay in a torpid &s;tupor. His angel wife, though every &s;igh
ha&s;tened her departure, pitied his pangs, and &s;orrowed for his
&s;ufferings. He, burning to di&s;clo&s;e what &s;hame forbid him to utter, and
&s;he dreading a horrid tale &s;he had long and &s;ilently anticipated!</P>
<P>In this &s;tate&mdash;that hand of death extended over her brow
which he would have given the world to have been directed to his&mdash;no
merciful tear to relieve his &s;wolen heart, he mu&s;t have expired with
exce&s;|&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility, had not a few inarticulate &s;ounds,
accompanied by a piteous &s;igh, bur&s;t from his tor|tured bo&s;om.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Be calm, my &s;weet love,' cried Lady
Hazard:</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Calm!' returned he</Q>&mdash;her cele&s;tial
voice penetrat|ing his torn heart, and the tears gu&s;hing in torrents 
<PB N="104" REF="106"> from his eyes&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, calm as the pitile&s;s butcher that kills
the innocent lamb! When thy &s;potle&s;s &s;oul &s;hall look down with ju&s;t
horror and kind commi&s;eration on thy polluted hu&s;band, and thy cruel
murderer, then tell me to be calm! Infu&s;e thy incomparable innocence into my
culpable heart, in&s;pire me with virtue, and teach me to be happy. See! Oh
heavenly God!&mdash;&s;he hears me with &s;orrow, but not with
a&s;toni&s;hment! She knew it!&mdash;'tis plain &s;he knew it!&mdash;and my
foul crimes have, like the influence of a malignant poi&s;on, &s;lowly
con&s;umed her life! Pity, pardon, immaculate angel!&mdash;But my thoughtle&s;s
frenzy is too much for her tender frame. How are you, my love? She an&s;wers
wildly!'</Q>&mdash;And &s;o indeed &s;he did. Lord Hazard's violence had thrown
her into a delirium, in which &s;he remained a few mi|nutes, and then
expired!</P>
<P>The incoherent expre&s;&s;ions &s;he uttered during this
melancholy interval, &s;ufficiently confimed Lord Hazard that his lady was but
too well acquainted with the fatal &s;ecret; and, le&s;t he &s;hould not be
wretched enough at her lo&s;s, he had now the addi|tional reflection that his
crime had fir&s;t &s;apped the foundation of her peace, and afterwards
gradually de&s;troyed her life. Regardle&s;s however of any di&s;|covery, or
its con&s;equences, he &s;ummoned every <PB N="105" REF="107"> po&s;&s;ible
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her aid; but no &s;yllable that e&s;|caped Lady Hazard
reached any ear, except that Charles, who fir&s;t entered the room, heard his
mo|ther fervently exclaim, which were the la&s;t words &s;he uttered, 
<Q REND="inline">'If any ble&s;&s;ings were in &s;tore for me, of
which I have been untimely deprived, &s;hower them, merciful heaven, upon the
head of my dear boy.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>NEW MATTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Having &s;o completely thrown the two families in the country
into the vapours, as to make it im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould play any of their
whim&s;ical tricks in our ab&s;ence, the reader and I will take a look at Mr.
Standfa&s;t and his a&s;&s;ociates; and, as much as any thing, becau&s;e it is
now high time that we &s;hould re&s;cue that gentleman's fame from &s;uch an
opprobrious &s;tain as that of having compa&s;&s;ed the death of Lady Hazard,
and brought about that &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s de&s;cribed in the la&s;t
chapter, &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of doing mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>I am ready to grant that no man upon earth had more
&s;atisfaction in contemplating the wretchedne&s;s which was produced by any
one of his contrivances, but then I do in&s;i&s;t that it was not &s;o much for
the plea&s;ure of the thing, as the collateral con&s;ideration; and I
&s;incerely believe, ill as I think of him, that could he have had the
&s;malle&s;t chance of doubling his <PB N="107" REF="109"> advantage, be it in
profit or plea&s;ure, by &s;acrific|ing his whole party, he would not have made
a &s;ingle &s;cruple.</P>
<P>But, to argue this matter fairly. What had Mr. Standfa&s;t
gained by heaping all this complicated mi&s;chief on the head of his friend and
benefactor, but an addition to the &s;alary which he had hone&s;tly earned by
being tutor to Charles? Why nothing literally, to be &s;ure, as to him&s;elf.
As to whom then? This is an article that remains to be ac|counted for. Again,
if Mr. Standfa&s;t, on his own account, received no other
&s;atisfaction&mdash;which &s;urely was a &s;mall reward for &s;uch eminent
villany&mdash;what other motive &s;timulated him? Revenge.&mdash;Revenge!
Yes:&mdash;and now let me get rid of the&s;e two articles. And fir&s;t, as to
whom he &s;eemed to be working for.</P>
<P>Know then reader that Mr. Standfa&s;t, the con|&s;ummately
artful Mr. Standfa&s;t, who&s;e &s;uperior talents in the craft of inflicting
unmerited calamity none ever attained, who&s;e truly diabolical &s;pirit never
conceived mi&s;chief complete unle&s;s the &s;haft with which it wounded
&s;truck at virtue, who could cajole and cozen all the world, and dupe every
one el&s;e, was him&s;elf a dupe to&mdash;Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y!</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"> Here is the collateral con&s;ideration,
but whence the revenge? From the &s;ame quarter. Mr. Stand|fa&s;t, who held all
women as his &s;laves, who treated &s;erious, rea&s;onable, honourable love as
a banter; who mocked at the very idea of a &s;olemn and &s;acred obligation to
a woman; this very Mr. Standfa&s;t,&mdash;pity him, oh pity him, villain as he
is&mdash;was a &s;lave to Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y. Hence his revenge. He was her
fir&s;t love; was the friend of him who killed her hu&s;band in a duel; &s;he
had a child by him before &s;he &s;aw Lord Hazard, and would have married him,
but that his lord&s;hip &s;tept in and carried her:&mdash;nay, let me whi&s;per
to the reader, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible but Zekiel was his &s;on.</P>
<P>A number of doubts which the reader had before formed, are now
di&s;&s;ipated; nor will it be nece&s;&s;ary to go again over the minutiae of
Mr. Standfa&s;t's conduct, which was dictated by her, though car|ried into
effect by him; and, as &s;he dared join o&s;|ten&s;ible acts to his covert
ones, what wonder if the un&s;u&s;pecting virtue of Lord Hazard was
&s;ur|pri&s;ed.</P>
<P>Her views and her ambition were obvious.&mdash;Lady Hazard was
to be put out of the way by a diabo|lical contrivance, which, had it been
avowed, could have fa&s;tened nothing on its perpetrators. His lord|&s;hip 
<PB N="109" REF="111"> would naturally be incon&s;olable for her lo&s;s, and
who knew if he would &s;urvive it, when he came to con&s;ider that it
originated in his guilt. Should this imaginary ble&s;&s;ing be realized, her
&s;on would come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the title and e&s;tate; if not,
&s;he would at lea&s;t have the triumphant con|&s;olation that &s;he had
imbittered his future felicity.</P>
<P>This conduct was natural and common, infa|mous as it was. But
how &s;hall we account for that of her paramour, who could not, fond &s;oul,
re&s;t in the country ab&s;ent from her he loved. Charles, as to Mi&s;s
Figgins, was a &s;toic to him. The lady had promi&s;ed, on the death of Lady
Hazard, to honour him with her hand, and in&s;tead of going to receive the
la&s;t benediction of an expiring uncle, his bu&s;i|ne&s;s in town was to keep
from expiring the valuable love of the amiable Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y.</P>
<P>Thus, while friend&s;hip, obligation, and all other ties that
naturally induce gratitude, only &s;timulated Mr. Standfa&s;t to every
atrocious and ra&s;cally mea|&s;ure that could &s;ap the foundation, and lay a
train for the de&s;truction, of that love and harmony that were exemplary in
the family of his patron and be|nefactor. The mere whim and caprice of a
wo|man, whom he knew to be worthle&s;s, and com|pletely the rever&s;e of every
thing for which &s;he could <PB N="110" REF="112"> expect admiration, made
him&mdash;expert as he was at every thing artful, proof as he was again&s;t
every thing but &s;elf&mdash;undertake the mo&s;t wicked, as well as the mo&s;t
&s;illy, things in nature. Here is a Hercules, not contented with wielding the
club&mdash;not quite &s;o worthily, by the bye&mdash;he buckles to the
di&s;taff.</P>
<P>It will be unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention that Figgins was
&s;ent for and fixed with Charles by Mr. Standfa&s;t's participation; nor will
it very probably have e&s;caped the reader's &s;agacity that the whole affair
of Mi&s;s Figgins, who had not been with child, was nothing more than to hold
out a pretended &s;e|cret over the head of that young gentleman; for both
Standfa&s;t and Figgins well knew that there is not a &s;tronger hold of a
grateful and generous heart than the knowledge of obligation: and this is the
&s;ort of credulity I have de&s;cribed as a part of our hero's compo&s;ition,
which, throughout his life, induced him to be thankful to others for lending
him imaginary benefits, that they might receive from him real ones.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould Charles be devoted to the &s;ame ruin with
others? He could not po&s;&s;ibly hinder any one of their &s;chemes. He had
nothing that could give them the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. Was it 
<PB N="111" REF="113"> then nothing to be the darling child, the hopeful
cheri&s;hed favourite, while Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y and her &s;on were turned into
the world, the &s;port of malicious tongues, and the ve&s;tiges of fallen
great|ne&s;s? Charles&mdash;though were the records of the human heart
&s;earched for every thing good and great that ever made up an amiable
character, the &s;ame marks of worth would be found in his:&mdash;Charles
mu&s;t be traduced, mu&s;t be vilified, it was nece&s;&s;ary, it was material;
he mu&s;t be &s;unk that his elder brother might ri&s;e. Be&s;ides, Mr.
Stand|fa&s;t had a hu&s;band in his eye for Annette; a better hu&s;band;
&s;ince who can deny but a rich, &s;en&s;ible, thinking youth, as one will
appear, an&s;wers that de&s;cription more perfectly than a poor, vicious,
di&s;|&s;ipated, incon&s;tant wretch, as will be the character of the
other.</P>
<P>Reader, it was not Zekiel that our friend Stand|fa&s;t had found
out for Annette. I know not if &s;uch an attempt would not have been a touch
even above his art; but, however, that young gentleman will probably &s;hew, by
and by, that he would chu&s;e to be con&s;ulted before any material &s;tep
&s;hould be taken that concerned him.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Zekiel had, at the time I am &s;peaking, pretty decided
opinions, and one of them was to <PB N="112" REF="114"> appear, however he
might really be, &s;atisfied with all his mother and Mr. Standfa&s;t &s;hould
determine, unle&s;s they &s;hould a&s;k him to &s;ign any paper, which he was
fully re&s;olved never to do.</P>
<P>As the reader has not yet heard the up&s;hot of the bu&s;ine&s;s
relative to tho&s;e letters wherein an applica|tion was made for the grant of
the e&s;tate in War|wick&s;hire, I may as well inform him here that Sir
Sidney's application rendered that of Mrs. O'Shock|ne&s;y and her &s;on
fruitle&s;s; therefore, through Standfa&s;t's advice, an addition was made to
the an|nual &s;tipend of the &s;on, who immediately left Eaton, and went to
France, with Snaffle for his companion, and Flu&s;h for his valet; while
Dogbolt, who had long ago dropt his title, being a hand&s;ome fellow,
occa&s;ionally comforted Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, when Mr. Standfa&s;t, who as yet
dared not &s;ee her, except by &s;tealth, was out of the way.</P>
<P>Mr. Kiddy had taken good care to make him&s;elf particularly
u&s;eful to Zekiel, who &s;wore there was &s;o much fun and gig about the rum
dog, that he would rather have him for a companion than all the black-jacket
codgers in England.</P>
<P>Whether Kiddy had any latent meaning in the &s;ingular pains he
took to ingratiate him&s;elf with his <PB N="113" REF="115"> young ma&s;ter, I
will not here enquire; but certain|ly Standfa&s;t one day told him to take care
how he came on, to which Kiddy archly replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, as for that, ma&s;ter governor, don't you
go for to be unea&s;y: honour you know among thieves.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus have I &s;hewn, when all things are con&s;i|dered, that
Standfa&s;t was the wor&s;t actor in his own farce. Nay I know not, upon all
great occa&s;ions, whether to the &s;ubordinate objects the whole prai&s;e is
not attributable. Trim &s;ays, while he is mu&s;ter|ing his tattered troop,
fifty thou&s;and &s;uch ragged ra&s;cals as the&s;e would make an ALEXANDER,
and who can deny but the taylor and the mantua-maker tell truth when they &s;ay

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A RECEIPT FOR BUILDING, BY BEGINNING AT THE
SUPER|STRUCTURE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR want of lei&s;ure, or perhaps inclination, or for &s;ome
other wi&s;e rea&s;on, no le&s;s cogent, I did not mention to the reader that,
at the la&s;t grand fea&s;t, a young &s;tranger appeared, and indeed attracted
a great deal of notice. He was then ju&s;t arrived from Madeira, and brought
letters to Sir Sidney from a merchant there, with whom the baronet dealt for
wines, and tran&s;acted other bu&s;ine&s;s. Coming &s;o opportunely, he was
invited to the fea&s;t, and cut, as I have &s;aid, no incon&s;iderable
figure.</P>
<P>Charles took great plea&s;ure in accommodating this gentleman,
who&s;e name was Glo&s;s; &s;tudying his ea&s;e and convenience while he
remained in War|wick&s;hire. He reque&s;ted the plea&s;ure of corre&s;|ponding
with him, and begged his intimate friend|&s;hip when he &s;hould return to
England, with a view of &s;ettling, which he talked of doing after he &s;hould
have taken a trip to the Cape of Good Hope, where <PB N="115" REF="117"> his
father had died immen&s;ely rich, on his return from India.</P>
<P>The winter had now began &s;o to perriwig the trees, as
&s;omebody has called it&mdash;by the way, &s;ome|body and nobody are very
u&s;eful figures in rhe|toric&mdash;that the &s;emicircle of evergreens before
Sir Sidney's &s;aloon, with the clu&s;ters near it, looked like a vegetable
court of judges and coun&s;ellors, in powdered ties and full-bottoms.</P>
<P>This hint, and a call of the hou&s;e of commons&mdash;for Sir
Sidney had &s;tayed in the country beyond his u&s;ual time, rou&s;ed the
baronet, and made him be|gin to think of putting on his boots. Yet not even his
duty, dearly as he loved it, could induce him to &s;tir a &s;tep without Lord
Hazard, who was become what SHAKESPEARE &s;ays of life, 
<Q REND="inline">'a walking &s;hadow.'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard looked upon him&s;elf as the execu|tioner of his
wife, and though his grief was inward, yet it did not e&s;cape &s;uch vigilant
friend&s;hip as Sir Sidney's. His lord&s;hip declared he would de|vote
him&s;elf to retirement. His friends, however, at length prevailed; and, to
make the &s;atisfaction complete and univer&s;al, Annette was, for the fir&s;t
time, to &s;ee London, accompanied by Emma.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"> It was the continual &s;tudy of every one
to make Lord Hazard's time pa&s;s agreeably, in which plea|&s;urable ta&s;k Mr.
Standfa&s;t now a&s;&s;i&s;ted, who&s;e pre|&s;ence his lord&s;hip
confe&s;&s;ed contributed greatly to relieve his care, though heaven knows he
had no &s;uch intention; for his vi&s;its were for no other pur|po&s;e than to
warn him of certain &s;nares which Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y was not preparing for
him, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to entangle him in others that &s;he was.</P>
<P>About Chri&s;tmas arrived Charles's friend Glo&s;s, from the
Cape of Good Hope, where he had, he &s;aid, &s;ettled his affairs greatly to
his &s;atisfaction.&mdash;He brought an&s;wers to &s;ome letters with which Sir
Sidney entru&s;ted him for Madeira.</P>
<P>As Mr. Glo&s;s will hereafter cut no incon&s;iderable figure in
this hi&s;tory, it may not be improper to give &s;ome account of him. He was
the &s;on of a clergyman, who, probably, knowing that the ad|vancement in the
learned profe&s;&s;ions was a thing that depended le&s;s upon merit than
intere&s;t, had bred him up to trade: not &s;paring, however, to give him a
complete education, which he very pro|perly thought could do him no harm in any
&s;itua|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="119"> One thing, however, was very romantic in
this &s;cheme. All the&s;e bricks were to be made without &s;traw; for the old
gentleman either could not, or would not, give his &s;on a &s;hilling, towards
laying a foundation for that fortune he was neverthele&s;s &s;ure he would one
day or other make. But having added the living languages to the dead ones, and
procured a recommendation for him to a counting|hou&s;e at Li&s;bon, they
parted: the father furni&s;hing him with &s;ome excellent rules for the
regulation of his future conduct, and forbidding him to draw for any thing but
advice.</P>
<P>The young gentleman's temper happened luckily to fall in with
his father's. He undertook, if he were eligibly &s;et out, to make his fortune.
His maxims were, from early youth, that if a man cho&s;e to fix his eye upon a
&s;pot, let it be ever &s;o out of his pre&s;ent reach, or &s;urrounded by ever
&s;uch diffi|culties, through per&s;everance it might be come at. In little, he
had proved this doctrine to be founded; for he never in his life
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in his own right, a &s;ingle &s;ixpence, and yet he had cut
a figure with the be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is curious to remark, that though no man upon earth knew
better the value of &s;ub&s;tance than Mr. Glo&s;s, yet he &s;eem con&s;tantly
to live upon <PB N="118" REF="120"> &s;hadow. The appearance, and not the thing
it&s;elf, &s;eemed to be what he mo&s;t delighted in. He &s;o com|pletely
turned round all his employers in their own bu&s;ine&s;s, that the tide of
their fortune &s;oon ran in a larger channel, and they were a&s;toni&s;hed at
the riches which originated from plans of his advi&s;ing. They however little
con&s;idered what a yoke they were forming for them&s;elves; for it was not
long before the young gentleman &s;tipulated for a parti|cipation of their
profits, in con&s;equence of which he took the earlie&s;t opportunity to
involve the af|fairs of the partner&s;hip, and was the only one able to &s;ave
any thing from the wreck of a bankruptcy, in which the whole concern was &s;oon
involved.</P>
<P>After this &s;troke he went to Madeira, where he drew a picture
of the folly of his partners, and &s;hewed very clearly&mdash;for it is
certainly true that people are to be rea&s;oned into, as well as out of, any
thing&mdash;how unwi&s;ely they had acted, and how fooli&s;hly he had thrown
away his time.</P>
<P>Being, through a hou&s;e with which he had been connected, very
&s;oon taken in an active partner, for a &s;light &s;hare of the profits, and
with liberty to trade privately on his own account, he entered into the
&s;pirit of the Madeira trade in &s;uch a &s;tyle as a&s;toni&s;h|ed every
merchant on the i&s;land. He had the ad|dre&s;s <PB N="119" REF="121"> to tie
the Dunkirk dealers down to give him and his connections a preference in
brandies, pro|vided they dealt to &s;uch an amount; in con&s;equence of which
he &s;oon had it in his power to &s;tagnate the Dunkirk trade in Madeira, by
being able to un|der&s;ell the brandy merchants them&s;elves, who, eager to
catch at the bait he held out for them, had &s;up|plied him largely, little
&s;u&s;pecting he would hold back what he had bought, with a view of
fore&s;talling their next market.</P>
<P>I give this as one among a variety of in&s;tances in which he
&s;aw further into people's affairs than they did them&s;elves. By this means
he had re&s;ources for them which they never dreamt of, and of cour&s;e was
able to &s;tipulate for better terms for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time it was, one would think, this man's pride never
to have a &s;hilling he could call his own. Nothing was expen&s;ive enough for
him, and when it was his turn to treat at Bachelor's-hall,&mdash;a place at
Madeira built by the unmarried men, and remarkable for ho&s;pitality&mdash;it
was in a &s;tyle that a&s;toni&s;hed every body: for his ta&s;te was equal to
his ingenuity.</P>
<P>At length Madeira became too barren a &s;pot for the fecundity
of his genius. He left it after giv|ing <PB N="120" REF="122"> it many real
advantages, and was univer&s;ally regretted, as a man wonderfully calculated
for bu|&s;ine&s;s, and yet a mo&s;t agreeable companion.</P>
<P>He got a con&s;iderable &s;um for his concern in the hou&s;e he
left, which he took care, in a few months, to get rid of in England.</P>
<P>The reader remembers that this gentleman brought letters from
his connections in Madeira to Sir Sidney. The&s;e were of cour&s;e greatly in
his fa|vour. Indeed the baronet was very well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew him any
kindne&s;s; but it was among the maxims of Mr. Glo&s;s never to make u&s;e of a
friend except to carry a material point, and a man mu&s;t be very &s;hallow
indeed if he could not pretty well gue&s;s beforehand whether that point could
be carried.</P>
<P>The plan upon which this young gentleman pro|ceeded was very
&s;imple, but it required con&s;ummate talents. It was nothing more than to
admini&s;ter to every man's foibles, and reprobate his vices. It is
imppo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe how a man is infallibly taken hold of by a
conduct of this kind. Very few are uniformly good, or uniformly wicked;
therefore, all who are not have both follies and vices mixed with &s;ome good
qualities, Our follies are always agree|able <PB N="121" REF="123"> to us, but
though all vices are the con&s;equence of them, we dete&s;t the vice it&s;elf,
while we hug the folly that may have cau&s;ed it. Clo&s;e however as we may
take folly to our hearts, we never fail to be privately a&s;hamed of
our&s;elves for it, nor to at|tribute, in the face of the world, our actions to
any thing el&s;e rather than this hidden cau&s;e. What power then mu&s;t that
man have over you, who, by encouraging you in your foibles, not only has
di&s;|covered this plea&s;urable deformity you are &s;o &s;tudious to hide,
but, by glo&s;&s;ing it over, contrives to make you believe it appears as
agreeable to him as to your&s;elf. This man has your heart fully and wholly,
and there is nothing you can deny him.</P>
<P>This was Mr. Glo&s;s, who, however he came by it, had this art
in the highe&s;t perfection, and knew &s;o well how and upon whom to play his
game, that he was ever &s;ure of coming off winner.</P>
<P>Nor are the talents which form this character of nece&s;&s;ity
required to be very brilliant, though va|rious and per&s;picuous. They are of
the minor kind: a quickne&s;s of conception, a clo&s;e ob&s;ervation on men and
manners, &s;ome &s;hrewdne&s;s, and a good memory compri&s;ing them all: to
which indeed&mdash;but that would be a deduction in worthy matters&mdash;
<PB N="122" REF="124"> mu&s;t be indi&s;pen&s;ibly added, frontle&s;s impudence
and a total want of feeling.</P>
<P>Any man with the&s;e in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if he em|ploy
him&s;elf in nothing but this pur&s;uit, will ar|rive to as great perfection in
the noble art of play|ing upon mankind, as will rai&s;e him to that degree of
con&s;equence he may think proper.</P>
<P>The&s;e qualifications &s;tood with Mr. Glo&s;s in the place of
Fortune, and with the&s;e he turned that fickle lady's wheel as he thought
proper.</P>
<P>Will not the reader begin to feel uncomfortable when, in
conformity to that veracity which all hi&s;|torians &s;hould critically keep in
view, I am obliged to declare that this was the gentleman Mr. Stand|fa&s;t had
in his eye as a hu&s;band for Annette.</P>
<P>Charles, Figgins, and Mr. Glo&s;s were in&s;epe|rable. The
latter cut a prodigious figure. He had an elegant chariot, half a dozen
footmen, and might have been taken for a newly arrived nabob. It was an
extraordinary thing, however, that go where they would, though he was &s;ure to
run up a mo&s;t expen&s;ive reckoning, he, by &s;ome carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or
other, con&s;tantly left his pur&s;e at home, &s;o that <PB N="123" REF="125">
he pre&s;ently became indebted to Charles more than two hundred pounds in odds
and ends of this kind.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ed off as eccentricity, and as he had a mo&s;t
agreeable apparent indolence of mind, which, by the way, was what Kiddy would
have called a copy of his countenance, he appeared to our hero the mo&s;t
delightful companion he had ever met with.</P>
<P>It was agreed that Charles, with Figgins as a companion,
&s;hould, early in the &s;pring, &s;et out to make a tour of Europe, in which
he ventured to expre&s;s a very &s;trong wi&s;h that Mr. Glo&s;s would
accompany him.</P>
<P>This however could not be. That gentleman was in treaty for a
borough, which a member was expected every day to vacate in his favour.
Be|&s;ides, he had reque&s;ted Sir Sidney to cheapen an e&s;tate for him in
Warwick&s;hire, and he was cur&s;ed|ly afraid that a certain woman of
condition, that he &s;aid &s;hould be namele&s;s&mdash;and &s;o &s;he well
might, for &s;he was not in exi&s;tence&mdash;would in&s;i&s;t upon a kind of a
half promi&s;e he had made, and noo&s;e him; which matter, he &s;aid, were it
really &s;erious, he verily believed would drive him abroad; for he did 
<PB N="124" REF="126"> not think the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fine&s;t and
riche&s;t wo|man in the kingdom a compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of any man's
liberty of his figure and con&s;equence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF ADVICE AND AN ADIEU TO ENGLAND.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;pring put an end to tho&s;e town enjoyments which had
employed the lei&s;ure hours of our hero and his connections, and now Charles
and his friend Figgins began to prepare for an excur&s;ion to tho&s;e parts of
the world where true politene&s;s is thought to be native, &s;o heartily do
Engli&s;hmen reprobate the manners of their own country, though they &s;o
dearly love its principles.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled that our hero &s;hould go on to Italy, by the
borders of Flanders, and not &s;ee Paris till on his return to England, through
the heart of France; as it was thought, by that means, he would the better
ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of that capital.</P>
<P>Charles's heart was fully &s;et on this tour, and, for &s;everal
days, it was the general topic of all the friends. He received the good
wi&s;hes and advice of all with great thankfulne&s;s. Sir Sidney, with 
<PB N="126" REF="128"> the heartie&s;t friend&s;hip, entreated him not to
en|graft French manners upon an Engli&s;h cion. He begged of him to hear,
&s;ee, and con&s;ider; to ap|prove and adopt whatever mended the heart, but to
reject with contempt all that merely went to deco|rate the per&s;on. He &s;aid
a flattering exterior was a dangerous thing, and there were &s;ometimes more
art and de&s;ign under a feather, than any graver de|coration of the head. He
&s;aid the whole character of the French was comprehended in minutiae; that
this rendered them at fir&s;t &s;ight agreeable, after|wards nece&s;&s;ary, and
at length, to credulous men, endearing, but to the penetrating trifling and
tire|&s;ome.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney &s;aid he would not wi&s;h for a better authority for
pronouncing a man weak and igno|rant than his having a &s;trong attachment,
upon re|peated trials, to the French in general. They were, he &s;aid, polite
without good manners; acquainted with every thing, though perfect in nothing;
pray|ing one moment and cheating the next; holding you in their arms, and
laughing over your &s;houlder; gay with de&s;ign; accommodating with arrogance;
apparently open, but really hypocritical; a&s;&s;uming with meanne&s;s. In
&s;hort, he &s;aid their lives were a mixture of pride and &s;ervility;
&s;elf-con&s;equence and adulation; &s;tateline&s;s and cringing;
prote&s;ta|tion <PB N="127" REF="129"> and in&s;incerity; and though their
&s;ports were the &s;ports of children, their mi&s;chief was the mi&s;|chief of
monkies.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Happy the man then, &s;ir,' &s;aid Charles,
'who, like you, can &s;en&s;ibly di&s;criminate between the extremes of this
motley character, and retain &s;o much of it for his own u&s;e as &s;hall make
him wary in his dealings with the world, without being
di&s;honourable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know not,' &s;aid Sir Sidney, 'whether I
de|&s;erve your compliment, but this is the very effect I would wi&s;h the
French manners to have upon you, who, however cautioned, will, I fear, from the
openne&s;s of your heart, and your &s;trong de|&s;ire to find men what they
ought to be, take, without examination, that dro&s;s which the French &s;o very
ea&s;ily contrive to pa&s;s for &s;terling. As to Italy, &s;ee every valuable
picture, &s;tatue, and &s;truc|ture; hear all that is excellent in mu&s;ic,
admire the country, and come away, le&s;t, exclu&s;ive of the danger to your
own morals, you are obliged to con|fe&s;s that the mo&s;t beautiful, and once
the mo&s;t glo|rious, place in the world, is now the mo&s;t infamous.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, who truly regarded Charles as her &s;on, as much
from inclination as from a promi&s;e <PB N="128" REF="130"> made to Lady Hazard
on her death bed, gave him only general advice as to his youth and
inexperience, relying however on his &s;trong good &s;en&s;e, and that
rectitude of heart which, as we have already noticed, was remarkable in &s;o
young a man. She promi&s;ed to keep Annette firmly to her &s;entiments of
e&s;teem for him, and doubted not but his conduct would warrant all her
exertions in the promotion of his happine&s;s; and finally, that Annette
improved at home, and he abroad, there could be no doubt of their making one of
the mo&s;t happy, as well as ele|gant couples in the world.</P>
<P>Emma warned him again&s;t the jays of France and the
nightingales of Italy. She &s;aid &s;he fore&s;aw that, if his heart was not
&s;teel and adamant, he would be ruined; that &s;he had read his mind
thoroughly, and plainly &s;aw that the only vice he had in the world was want
of deceit. It was, to be &s;ure, a &s;trange declaration, but it was very true.
That &s;he &s;hould not wonder at any thing he became in the hands of the
French and Italians; for he was &s;uch pliable wax that any man, with a
plau&s;ible &s;tory, the argu|ment of which could be deduced from a good
mo|tive, might &s;hape him into any form. She begged of him, in particular, to
beware of holy hypocrites. What &s;he had read, &s;he told him, of their
cruelty and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, was yet wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, than all 
<PB N="129" REF="131"> the gambols with which the forms of their facetious
religion &s;eemed to burle&s;que its author: or rather, the author of that
which they daringly ventured to innovate, and which involved a &s;y&s;tem of
morality mild as mercy, and benignant as his holy name who e&s;tabli&s;hed it.
Above all &s;he cautioned him again&s;t convents, and an intercour&s;e with
tho&s;e drones of &s;ociety the inmates of them, who, from lei&s;ure to plan,
and inclination to execute, were the perpe|trators of every &s;pecies of
profligacy and mi&s;chief. Her reading, &s;he &s;aid, had induced her to
believe that there were more than three hundred thou&s;and cloy&s;tered clergy
in France, and a proportionable number of females; that the wickedne&s;s, the
attro|cious wickedne&s;s carried on within tho&s;e walls, which were
&s;uppo&s;ed to immure &s;aints, was &s;hock|to humanity.</P>
<P>Emma further ob&s;erved that it could not be &s;up|po&s;ed that
any thing like the licentious infamy of France and Italy could ever have been
practi&s;ed here, becau&s;e England had, properly &s;peaking, never been the
&s;eat of that dangerous religion; but let it be recollected, in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, what barbarous, what dete&s;table ve&s;tiges of popi&s;h
profligacy were di&s;covered at the demo|li&s;hing Netley abbey, and many other
convents.&mdash;Subterraneous communications for nightly vi&s;its 
<PB N="130" REF="132"> from friars to nuns, and nuns to friars. Hidden infants
apparently murdered. If then the plant, which was here an exotic, grew to
&s;uch perfection, how mu&s;t it flouri&s;h in its native &s;oil. It was
hor|rible to think of it!</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' added Emma, if I may credit what I have
read, this mo&s;t unholy, irreverent, indecent, ri|diculous religion, is
clearly where it exi&s;ts a je&s;t with all but the &s;uper&s;titious ignorant.
What is the mode of choo&s;ing a pope but a bla&s;phemous impo&s;ition, in
which, one would think, to puni&s;h them for pre&s;umptuou&s;ly daring to give
out that their election is from heaven, they once, by in|&s;piration no doubt,
as well as upon all other oc|ca&s;ions, cho&s;e a woman, who betrayed her
&s;ex, their &s;hame, and opened the eyes of every one who cho&s;e to &s;ee.
But <HI>vive la bagatelle</HI> in that, as in every thing el&s;e, &s;oon got
the better of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound rea&s;on, and they went on electing
popes, the choice of heaven; not however with|out taking a precaution, le&s;t
heaven &s;hould have again deceived them.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma's precautions were applauded by a bur&s;t of laughter, and
Charles entreated her to make her&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y, giving her his word
that he would take particular care that his &s;mall plan|tation 
<PB N="131" REF="133"> of under&s;tanding &s;hould not be eaten up by the&s;e
black locu&s;ts.</P>
<P>Annette took an innocent but tender leave of her lover; for Emma
had ever encouraged her not to be a&s;hamed of a truly virtuous pa&s;&s;ion.
Our hero felt him&s;elf greatly charmed at the di&s;tinction, and exulted not a
little at reflecting that after time and experience &s;hould have prepared him
with manly and proper re&s;olutions, and given him riper quali|ties of mind and
per&s;on, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o charm|ing an object would be within
his reach. Many were their mutual prote&s;tations: ardent, yet inno|cent;
heartfelt, yet rea&s;onable. At length they &s;eparated, with a promi&s;e to
write to each other, and with vows of inviolable fidelity.</P>
<P>One audience now only &s;tood with Lord Hazard, before the time
when our hero was to depart. This interview was without witne&s;s. My lord took
his &s;on tenderly by the hand, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Charles, lowered as I am by my grief,
wretched by calamity, and di&s;ordered by both, my merits are more than
rewarded by having you for my &s;on. I never made you a &s;tranger to my
youthful exce&s;&s;es; indeed it would perhaps be policy to paint them to you
even in their &s;tronge&s;t colours, that you might &s;hun the certain ruin
that awaits <PB N="132" REF="134"> &s;uch profligacy. Your incomparable mother,
now no more, was&mdash;I cannot think of it but my &s;oul is in
arms&mdash;given me to ble&s;s my repentant heart with comfort more than &s;uch
a wretch de|&s;erved; yet did I, after the enjoyment of &s;uch bli&s;s, &s;uch
unexampled delight, da&s;h the cup of happine&s;s from my lips, in the very
moment that it held for me all the ble&s;&s;ings of life in one deli|cious
draught.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Wonder not at my words, Charles, it is very
true; your mother owes her death to me!&mdash;to your father!&mdash;to your
wretched culpable father! He who &s;hould from duty, from gratitude, from a
&s;en&s;e of his own honour, her virtues, her an|gelic virtues, have avoided
like contagion the mo&s;t di&s;tant means that could wound her mind the
thou&s;andth part of a moment, much le&s;s join with wretches, with infamous
dete&s;table wretches, to work the de&s;truction of her peace, and then her
life! Oh look with pity,' cried he, in agony, injured, martyred &s;aint, and
calm the woes that tear me!&mdash;that de&s;troy me!&mdash;that feed me with
&s;uch torturing remor&s;e as would make me think annihilation a ble&s;&s;ing!
My dear boy thou art a&s;toni&s;hed.'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am indeed &s;ir,' &s;aid Charles; 'but it

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF POLITENESS, A TRIP TO CALAIS, AND A CU|RIOUS
DISCOVERY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY thing Mr. Figgins had done hitherto was rather a partial
rehear&s;al behind the &s;cenes than the actual performance of his part. He now
comes forward on the &s;tage, where we dare tru&s;t him with|out a prompter,
&s;o well had he perfected him&s;elf in tho&s;e &s;cenes where he was
de&s;tined to make his appearance: and indeed it were to be wi&s;hed that other
actors, whether on the theatre or in the pul|pit, at the bar, at court, or any
of tho&s;e many playhou&s;es in the kingdom, were&mdash;though but for the
&s;ake of con&s;i&s;tency&mdash;half &s;o well qualified to &s;u&s;tain their
parts, or half &s;o perfect in them.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140"> Charles had not twice changed hor&s;es in
his way to Dover before he had much welcome cau&s;e to be charmed with the
&s;olicitude of his friend. Figgins well knew that to treat a di&s;order in the
mind, he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to a practice the very rever&s;e of that
generally adopted with relation to the body; therefore, in&s;tead of
nau&s;eous, unpalatable draughts, in which one would think its profe&s;&s;ors
imagined con&s;i&s;t all the &s;ecrets of phy&s;ic, he &s;tudiou&s;ly went
about to prepare all that he conceived would charm the heart and expand the
liberal mind of our hero. He drew him from his &s;ilence by degrees; extolled
in the highe&s;t terms of admiration his filial piety; repre&s;ented the
condition of his father as the work|ings of a truly amiable mind, formerly
irregular indeed, but now re&s;tored to the exerci&s;es of rea&s;on and
benevolence; he drew a warm picture of both the power and the will of Sir
Sidney to &s;ooth all his cares; and finally, painted the extreme
&s;atisfaction that would re&s;ult to him by a contemplation that he had one
&s;on who would become &s;o great an honour to him as to make noble amends for
the obloquy ca&s;t upon his name by the de&s;picable ignorance and
con|temptible conduct of the other.</P>
<P>After &s;everal &s;imilar preparations, he began to enter upon
the grand &s;ubject, and at length made his young friend perfectly &s;en&s;ible
for what purpo&s;e <PB N="139" REF="141"> they were then in the po&s;t
chai&s;e. France and all its gaieties began in&s;en&s;ibly to blend in their
con|ver&s;ation, and Figgins archly remarked that gravity was an exotic which
certainly would not flouri&s;h in &s;o &s;miling a climate.</P>
<P>Charles was ever remarkably tenacious of not permitting his
private feelings to inconvenience his friends, and the le&s;s he conceived
him&s;elf obliged to re&s;traint by a man's pre&s;ence, the more forward he was
to &s;hew that his attention was voluntary.&mdash;He felt Figgins's kindne&s;s,
and began to unbend. Be&s;ides, he had high health, and brilliant &s;pirits;
and however &s;incerely he might grieve at heart when he reflected&mdash;which
he certainly very often did for his time of life&mdash;&s;orrow caught but
little apparent hold on his volatile mind.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Dover, they be&s;poke a pa&s;&s;age boat to
them&s;elves for the next morning, and while it was yet day-light took a walk
to &s;ee that cliff which Emma had convinced her&s;elf, by her read|ing, though
now the boundary of the channel, had certainly, in former times, made a part of
the con|tinent.</P>
<P>On their return to &s;upper, the landlady informed them that a
young lady, attended by a footman and <PB N="140" REF="142"> a female
&s;ervant, had arrived &s;ince their departure, and finding that our travellers
had engaged the only pa&s;&s;age boat on the Dover &s;ide, expre&s;&s;ed an
anxious wi&s;h that &s;he might be permitted to go half the expence of the
ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ail with that opportu|nity, for that her affairs called for
expedition; and &s;he had been al&s;o informed that as the wind blew right into
Calais harbour there would be no chance of any arrival from thence.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be conceived that the reque&s;t was in&s;tantly
complied with, though not the terms of it. A genteel compliment was in&s;tantly
returned to the lady, with an earne&s;t entreaty that &s;he would &s;uffer the
gentlemen to wait on her. The interview was permitted, the lady was
complimented with the offer of a pa&s;&s;age for her and her &s;ervants, which
it was delicately hinted to her mu&s;t be gratis, and, after as much
he&s;itation as was due to good breed|ing, &s;he accepted the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>What Figgins had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully began, this lady
completed. She was young, hand&s;ome, and lively, and though there appeared now
and then a little levity in her manner, yet Charles, upon Figgins's
&s;ugge&s;tion, was willing to attribute it to her extrac|tion and &s;ituation,
the fir&s;t of which they &s;oon <PB N="141" REF="143"> learnt from her own
mouth was French, and the latter that of a widow.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, it came out, to the
great &s;atisfaction of our travellers, that this young lady, by name St.
Vivier, was born in En|gland, and the daughter of a French refugee; that &s;he
married a French gentleman, who was pro|&s;cribed for &s;ome overt acts in
which he &s;tood up for the liberty of the &s;ubject, but he now being dead,
&s;he was going to &s;ee what &s;he could collect in France of the &s;cattered
remains of his fortune; that her journey was to Lyons, and being obliged to
make &s;ome &s;tay at Sedan, for intelligence among her late hu&s;band's
relations, &s;he &s;hould pur&s;ue her rout by the borders of Flanders.</P>
<P>As this was &s;tep for &s;tep the way that had been marked out
for Charles, what could be &s;o fortunate as the above intelligence. This fact
was commu|nicated, and a propo&s;al &s;ugge&s;ted that they &s;hould make that
tour together. It was not however men|tioned but with the mo&s;t &s;uitable
propriety as to preparation and manner. The lady found great difficulty to
believe that her route was really that which our travellers had intended to
take, but &s;aw, &s;he &s;aid, that they were &s;o polite as to alter their
intention in compliment to her.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144"> Both Charles and Figgins vehemently
prote&s;ted the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion, and indeed u&s;ed &s;o many
arguments to convince her that it would have been an infringment of that
politene&s;s which &s;he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a natural and elegant
degree to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urther doubted their
veracity. The next difficulty was that it would appear very odd if &s;he
&s;hould travel in the company of &s;trangers. Charles &s;aid &s;he had her own
&s;ervants with her, and Figgins noticed that they were all alike &s;trangers
in France, where indeed no explanations were ever required when people paid
their way. This &s;he &s;aid &s;he &s;hould make a point of doing to the
utmo&s;t farthing, if &s;he con&s;ented at all, but at any rate &s;he mu&s;t
en|treat till the morning to con&s;ider of the propriety of their propo&s;al, 
<Q REND="inline">'for,' added &s;he, 'a woman of ho|nour cannot
be too cautious, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a licentious country as France has been
de&s;cribed to me.'</Q></P>
<P>In this remark both our hero and his friend ac|quie&s;ced, and
now &s;upper being announced, the lady, after &s;ome little difficulty, was
prevailed on to partake of it; not however without remarking that matters
mu&s;t be put upon a different footing when they &s;hould arrive on the other
&s;ide of the wa|ter. To which our hero replied, with a very pe|netrating
glance, that he &s;incerely hoped it would <PB N="143" REF="145"> be &s;o, and,
upon the lady's looking grave, added, &s;ince it appeared to be her wi&s;h.</P>
<P>A &s;mart breeze the next day conducted them &s;afely to Calais
in &s;omething more than three hours, where, after the cu&s;tomary ceremonies
of entering their names, paying a vi&s;it to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, giving
&s;omething in charity, and &s;atisfying a few clamorous porters, they were
glad to get hold of &s;ome <HI>&s;oup gras</HI> at De&s;&s;eins, which, as well
as the re&s;t of their dinner, they found excellent.</P>
<P>In the evening they went to the play, which was al&s;o performed
in the &s;ame inn, where there is a remarkable neat theatre, and by no means
&s;mall. During the performance Charles was greatly plea&s;ed with the remarks
of Madame St. Vivire, who &s;poke French admirably well, and perfectly ta&s;ted
the neat nothingne&s;s of the French little operas, two of which were that
night given. Our hero, who knew al&s;o that language as well as reading could
teach it him, begged to be this lady's &s;cholar for the prac|tical part of it.
She readily agreed, by which means, as he feigned, whenever he found it
con|venient, to know le&s;s than he did, he had a thou|&s;and opportunities of
indulging him&s;elf in a thou|&s;and witty &s;allies, by way of trying how a
declara|tion of love would be taken, which he the le&s;s he|&s;itated 
<PB N="144" REF="146"> to do, as a widow at her own di&s;po&s;al was fairly out
of his agreement.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t tried his French eloquence to per&s;uade her that the
plea&s;ure of her charming company and the advantage of the rapid improvement
he &s;hould make under her tuition would amply overbalance the expences of
their journey. At fir&s;t however &s;he could not think of con&s;enting to
this, but Charles being &s;trongly &s;econded by Figgins, &s;he at length
agreed.</P>
<P>This matter &s;et Charles more at ea&s;e, for he was pretty well
a&s;&s;ured &s;he could not be a woman of very nice honour who would, in this
in&s;tance, yield to the &s;olicitation of two &s;trangers. He there|fore
determined to ply her with the whole force of his amorous eloquence. At night
he took notice &s;he &s;ipped the burgundy pretty freely, which op|portunity he
&s;eized to in&s;inuate &s;ome bold hints which were not ill received.
Maintaining this ground, he had &s;oon rea&s;on to think the lady would, after
a very &s;hort &s;iege, &s;urrender in form, which hopes were confirmed the
next morning by Figgins, who had already won the lady's woman&mdash;both a
hand&s;ome and genteel girl&mdash;and reaped the fruits of his victory.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"> Charles redoubled his a&s;&s;iduity, and
Madam St. Vivier, after holding out with great apparent mo|de&s;ty, at length
reluctantly promi&s;ed to make him happy on their arrival at Li&s;le, to which
place, having &s;een every thing at Calais, not forgetting the picture where
the citizens are kneeling to King Edward, with halters about their necks, which
curio&s;ity was recommended to his attention by Emma, they now prepared to
&s;et out.</P>
<P>About an hour before the hor&s;es were to be ready, Mr.
De&s;&s;ein begged the favour of an au|dience with Charles, which being granted
him, after a proper apology and preparation, he &s;aid he had a matter of great
delicacy to communicate, which concerned him nearly.</P>
<P>Charles expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at this declara|tion,
and having previou&s;ly promi&s;ed at De&s;&s;ein's entreaty, that he would in
no wi&s;e take the matter ill, he was informed that, &s;ome months before, a
gentleman came to him one morning, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. De&s;&s;ein I have been robbed of tho&s;e
eighty <HI>louis d'ors</HI> which I ye&s;terday received from you in a
bag.'</Q> He replied it was impo&s;&s;ible; that his money might probably be
mi&s;laid, or found by the &s;ervants, but that in that hou&s;e nobody could be
<PB N="146" REF="148"> robbed. He would make enquiry, he &s;aid, and the money
would be re&s;tored to him.</P>
<P>The gentleman went out, and at his return De&s;&s;ein had eighty
<HI>louis d'ors</HI> ready for him in a bag &s;imilar to the other, for money
being in France often paid in three livre and &s;ix livre pieces, the bankers
have all bags on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The excu&s;e made to the gentleman was, that, as the hou&s;e was
very full the evening before, the &s;er|vant, after he was a&s;leep, &s;eeing
the bag lie on the ground, had brought it to one of the clerks, who had put it
in the counting hou&s;e; for it &s;hould be known that De&s;&s;ein is a banker
as well as an inn|keeper. The gentleman, not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect|ing the
truth of what he heard, put the money in his pocket, and went away.</P>
<P>The fact, however, which had been &s;o artfully
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, was this: De&s;&s;ein &s;aid he &s;aw in a mo|ment that the
gentleman had been really robbed, and upon making his enquiries, as to the
&s;ituation of the lodgers, he found to a certainty by whom. In &s;hort, he
&s;aid, this crime was committed by a young Engli&s;h gentleman, heir to a high
title, and a large e&s;tate; that it could not be for want of mo|ney, 
<PB N="147" REF="149"> as, no doubt, he might have had what he plea&s;ed of his
father; but finding him&s;elf in an immediate nece&s;&s;ity, in&s;tead of
applying to him, in which ca&s;e he might have been &s;upplied, he took this
&s;um without con&s;idering the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Mr. De&s;&s;ein &s;aid the re&s;olution he took upon it was to
&s;ay nothing upon the &s;ubject to any per&s;on till he &s;hould &s;ee the
young gentleman him&s;elf, for that out of gratitude to the Engli&s;h, to whom
he owed his all, he would rather lo&s;e ten times that &s;um than make a &s;tir
about &s;uch a trifle, but that having &s;een that young gentleman &s;ince, and
been treated by him in a very <HI>en cavalier</HI> &s;tyle, though he was
determined not to expo&s;e him, except to his own family, he &s;hould now
certainly make no &s;cruple of applying for the money.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he informed our hero, who began now to &s;mell a
rat, that Zekiel was the thief.</P>
<P>What an opportunity is here to put an end to this hi&s;tory!
Charles had nothing to do but get his brother hanged, to be heir to the family,
title, and e&s;tate, his marriage with Annette would have fol|lowed of
cour&s;e, and when they had produced half <PB N="148" REF="150"> a dozen
children, for Lord Hazard to dandle on his knee, and comfort him&s;elf in his
old age, he would have &s;unk peaceably to re&s;t, and have left his darling
&s;on and daughter in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ho|nours.</P>
<P>Whether Charles fore&s;aw an uniform tranquil|lity in &s;uch a
life, and was determined to experi|ence what &s;ort of plea&s;ures are
generally produced by variety, or whether&mdash;which is full as
proba|ble&mdash;he felt a &s;trong wi&s;h to hide his unnatural brother's
frailty, we will not enquire. Certain it is, he, without he&s;itation, repaid
Mr. De&s;&s;ein upon the &s;pot, thanked him for his prudence, and
re|pre&s;ented that he was &s;orry to &s;ee his brother po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o
in&s;olent a &s;pirit, but begged he would con&s;ider the whole as an
extravagant <HI>tour de jeune&s;&s;e,</HI> which had more of fal&s;e wit in it
than premedi|tated vice. He de&s;ired that the whole might &s;ink into
oblivion, and in particular that it might never come to his father's ears.</P>
<P>Mr. De&s;&s;ein promi&s;ed literally to follow the di|rections
of our hero, with who&s;e manner and ge|nero&s;ity he was very much &s;truck;
and could not help remarking that he plainly &s;aw, though 
<PB N="149" REF="151"> the honour was ve&s;ted in the elder brother, the
younger po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the virtues which could alone enoble a family.</P>

<P>CHARLES having fini&s;hed this bu&s;ine&s;s greatly to his
&s;atisfaction, determined that no hint &s;hould e&s;|cape him concerning it,
not even to Figgins; but, le&s;t future in&s;tances of his brother's nefarious
con|duct &s;hould multiply in a &s;trange country, where it would co&s;t him
dearly to extricate him&s;elf from &s;uch difficulties, he lengthened a letter
he had al|ready written to his father, by fir&s;t very delicately apologizing
for touching on &s;uch a &s;ubject, and then entreating that his brother's
allowance might be augmented, even though his own &s;hould be curtailed; for
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a man in any &s;tyle to cut a figure in
France&mdash;particularly a young and inexperienced man&mdash;with a &s;lender
in|come. He gave &s;ome general rea&s;ons for this re|que&s;t, and, though with

<P><PB N="151" REF="153"> After entreating Mr. De&s;&s;ein to
&s;end any letters forward for him to Li&s;le, he took leave of Calais.</P>
<P>At Li&s;le they purpo&s;ed &s;taying a few days, and as Charles
promi&s;ed him&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ma|dame St. Vivier, he was
determined to &s;port as grand a figure as his circum&s;tances would
allow.&mdash;He therefore hired a carriage, made parties, and gave <HI>petits

Engli&s;h &s;port&s;men, were hunt|ing out for any body who could &s;peak a
word of Engli&s;h. Figgins and our hero relieved their di&s;tre&s;s as much as
po&s;&s;ible. At length &s;upper appeared, and pre&s;ently one of our bucks
&s;aid to the other, 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;ay, you Tadpole, if I can think how &s;o
many people jabber &s;o cur&s;e confoundedly with their jaws full.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, my lord,' &s;aid his friend, 'a Frenchman's
jaws are like the tools of a trunk maker, they always make more noi&s;e than

<P>Figgins gave them a hint that they had better be on their guard,
le&s;t any of the company &s;hould un|der&s;tand Engli&s;h.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh dam'me,' &s;aid my lord, 'the queer lantern
jawed bitches of fellows know no more about Engli&s;h than they do about

<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI>' an&s;wered a very polite
abbe.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;ay,' &s;aid my lord, 'Moun|&s;eer, how
much &s;oup meeger and frogs do you hide away, when you can get it, in your
leather bags of cheeks, that look for all the world like the jaw bags of a

<P><PB N="153" REF="155"> The abbe, after paying him the utmo&s;t

<Q REND="inline">'He fays he does not under&s;tand what you

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come &s;ir,' &s;aid my lord, 'no offence to
you, but I will bet you five hundred, and I &s;ay done fir&s;t, that if any
French ra&s;cal in company dares for to offer an affront to me, I twigs him a

<P> At this moment Madam St. Vivier &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'My Lord Hazard I have the plea&s;ure of
drinking your health.'</Q> To which Charles an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Madam I thank you; give me leave to
drink with you, that our wi&s;hes may be mutual.'</Q></P>
<P> The &s;tranger, who was di&s;puting with Figgins, here cried
out, 
<Q REND="inline">'Hey! what's this! Here you Tad|pole, how is
this? Here is a gentleman does me the honour to take up my title before I am
dead, ay and before my old put of a father is dead too!'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156"> Charles, penetrating in a moment the
whole force of the&s;e few words, blu&s;hed with indignation, which Zekiel
perceiving&mdash;for the reader &s;ees it was he&mdash;followed the blow he had
given, by &s;aying 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, dam'me, fine work; fine times, when every
little whipper &s;napper can &s;et up for a lord!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True,' &s;aid Figgins, who had a mind to give
our he|ro time for recollection, 'and one may &s;ee by your own appearance how
contemptible it is,'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' &s;aid Mr. Tadpole, 'you mu&s;t now
&s;uffer me to &s;peak &s;ir. This gentleman is certainly the elde&s;t &s;on of
Lord Hazard, who has ridiculou&s;ly di&s;carded him under pretence of libertine
conduct, when there is &s;carcely &s;uch an old libertine as him&s;elf in
exi&s;tence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Charles, 'your a&s;&s;ertion is a
fal&s;ity. I &s;ee this whole bu&s;ine&s;s. I am by accident in the company of
my elder brother, who &s;hall not, nor &s;hall you &s;ir, traduce the character
of the mo&s;t amiable father that ever had exi&s;tence.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' &s;aid Figgins, 'let the matter,
now it is explained, be, as it ought, forgotton; or at lea&s;t defer it all the
company is gone, or till to-mor|row morning.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I defer it!' &s;aid the young lord;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'no &s;uch thing I a&s;&s;ure you:&mdash;who's
afraid of the&s;e grinning ba|boons <PB N="155" REF="157"> here?'</Q> for the
Frenchmen had by this time began to &s;hrug up their &s;houlders, and
demon&s;trate other tokens of admiration. 
<Q REND="inline">'My brother Charles here, for that is the go I
&s;ee, thinks, becau&s;e he has got a parcel of &s;tarve-gutted rips of
moun|&s;eers about him, that a man of my condition, dam'me, is to be grinned
out of his title.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'When the title comes to be yours,' retorted
Charles, 'there will be more likelihood of grinning than at pre&s;ent; but the
matter, as Mr. Figgins has very properly &s;aid, &s;hould drop, which you had
better agree to your&s;elf, at lea&s;t for the pre|&s;ent, if it were only in
con&s;ideration of your being my gue&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your gue&s;t!' &s;aid Zekiel, 'why do you think
as I would have come for to eat any of your &s;up|per if I had been up to
&s;uch fine gig as this?'&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'As much,' &s;aid Charles, as I would have
invited you, had I known who you were:&mdash;as the invita|tion therefore was
&s;ent as from &s;tranger to &s;tran|ger, I am willing to give it another turn
to all tho&s;e who have not under&s;tood the di&s;pute, and I am &s;ure the
whole company will join in laughing it off.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, and a fine laugh it would be again&s;t me,
<PB N="156" REF="158"> hey Tadpole. No, no, dam'me, I will tell them all about
it. I &s;ay, Moun&s;eer, no my lord he&mdash;I my lord.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Ah ha!</HI>' &s;aid an officer, without
under&s;tanding him.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me if I ever &s;aw &s;uch a &s;et of fools
in my life,' &s;aid Zekiel.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That man no my lord at all; I am one great,
grand my lord my&s;elf!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very great and very grand indeed,' &s;aid
Charles; 'it is pity that nobody knows it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are a puppy, Mr. Charles,' &s;aid Zekiel:
why the devil don't you help me out, Tadpole? you can jabber a little of their
damned gib|beri&s;h.'</Q></P>
<P>Tadpole undertook to inform the company how the matter &s;tood,
in which account he certainly be|haved very &s;candalou&s;ly, by repre&s;enting
Zekiel as a lord, and Charles as an impo&s;tor, without ex|plaining how
innocently the matter had been fallen into. Here Charles interfered with all
the warmth he could. It was however to no purpo&s;e. <HI>Ce&s;t affreux! Je&s;u
Maria! Ce&s;t honteux!</HI> and half a dozen other expre&s;&s;ions of
a&s;toni&s;hment, were all uttered together, and the whole company agreed that
they had all along feared our hero was a low born fellow by his prodigality. In
&s;hort, a thou&s;and marks of <PB N="157" REF="159"> attention were
immediately lavi&s;hed upon Zekiel, which being interpreted to him through the
me|dium of Tadpole, he &s;wore he never liked French people &s;o well in his
life, while Charles, fortified by indignation again&s;t the apo&s;tacy of his
gue&s;ts, did not now think it worth his while to undeceive them, but contented
him&s;elf with taking this as a caution how he &s;hould &s;ummon together a
promi&s;|cuous company in France at his own expence for the future.</P>
<P>Figgins however was determined it &s;hould not go off &s;o. He
ob&s;erved that not one of the company, while they be&s;towed pretty liberally
the mo&s;t humi|liating epithets on Charles, grudged to eat or drink any thing
they could lay their hands on, he there|fore moved that either nothing &s;hould
be touched, or that they would accompany every word, in the manner they had
before this di&s;covery, with &s;ome well-turned compliment to him at who&s;e
expence they &s;at down; for as nothing was expected for &s;o &s;umptuous an
entertainment but words&mdash;a coin in which they were very rich and very
prodigal&mdash;he mu&s;t beg, in the name of his friend, that they would fulfil
the conditions of the fea&s;t, otherwi&s;e it would induce him to wi&s;h for a
bill, that every man might pay his reckoning in another coin, with 
<PB N="158" REF="160"> which he did not believe they were &s;o well
pro|vided.</P>
<P>This &s;arca&s;m gave very high offence, notwith|&s;tanding
which they eat and drank on without offer|ing to comply with either of Mr.
Figgins's condi|tions, till at la&s;t Zekiel, to whom they were ex|plained
through Tadpole, offered to pay his &s;hare, and invited his new friends to
follow his ex|ample.</P>
<P>His adherents began now to for&s;ake him; no one came into his
propo&s;al, and all eyes were imme|diately fixed again upon Charles, who
&s;eeing what &s;ort of turn matters were likely to take, got up, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'Come gentlemen, I will end the
di&s;pute:&mdash;Is it not fair that he &s;hould be con&s;idered as the true
Lord Hazard who pays the bill?'</Q></P>
<P>A general affirmative was in&s;tantly given, and Zekiel being
a&s;ked if he would pay the whole ex|pence of the evening out of his pocket,
an&s;wered he would &s;ee &s;uch a &s;et of moun&s;eers and madames at the
devil fir&s;t. Charles then called the waiter, who &s;aid there was nothing to
pay, for that his honour had &s;atisfied every thing, as well for the &s;upper
as the dance and little opera that would enter in a few minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"> Zekiel now under went a thou&s;and
mortifications, which he contented him&s;elf with returning by a|bu&s;e, in a
language the Frenchmen could not un|der&s;tand. At length he &s;neaked off to
bed, vowing revenge again&s;t his brother, which Mr. Flu&s;h, who, as we have
&s;aid, was a follower of his fortunes, a&s;&s;ured him, as he a&s;cended the
gallery, was ea&s;ily practicable.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid Charles had rea&s;on to believe that
Madame St. Vivier would at Li&s;le recompen&s;e his attention, by con&s;enting
to make him happy upon his own terms. That very night &s;hew was to comply with
his wi&s;hes, and this &s;ecret, by a means I &s;hall take an opportunity one
time or other to ex|plain, Mr. Flu&s;h had di&s;covered, and now im|parted it
to Zekiel, who getting in&s;tructions as to the &s;ituation of all the
different bed-chambers, de|termined to &s;upplant his brother.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this determination, when all was &s;ilent in
the inn, he went to the room where he had been directed, and finding it
invitingly open, fa&s;tened the door on the in&s;ide, and groped about till he
found the bed. Being acco&s;ted by a female voice, in a whi&s;per, he replied
in the &s;ame man|ner. He then undre&s;t him&s;elf, and was welcomed into bed
as warmly as he could wi&s;h. In about <PB N="160" REF="162"> half an hour
after, another per&s;on knocked &s;oftly at the door, whom he of cour&s;e
gue&s;&s;ed to be his brother Charles; but, advi&s;ing the lady not to take the
&s;malle&s;t notice of this intru&s;ion, after a &s;hort time the importunate
vi&s;itant gave over knocking, and went away.</P>
<P>He began now to glory in his &s;ucce&s;s, and had a great mind
to &s;tay and brazen the whole matter out, but was &s;o earne&s;tly entreated
by the lady to &s;pare her delicacy, and to leave her before the day dawned,
that he at length complied.</P>
<P>Elated with this revenge, Zekiel, as he occa|&s;ionally
pa&s;&s;ed our hero in the morning, could not help looking big, and half
in&s;ulting him. Charles bore every thing very patiently, till, being obliged
to an&s;wer an impertinent que&s;tion or two, a very provoking altercation
en&s;ued, and Zekiel ventured a mo&s;t invidious and wanton invective again&s;t
the memory of Charles's mother. Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when
our hero fairly knocked him down, and indeed was &s;o tran&s;ported with
pa&s;&s;ion, that he &s;wore he would not re&s;t a mo|ment till he had
&s;acrificed &s;o infamous a ra&s;cal to the offended laws.</P>
<P>Zekiel being again upon his legs, came up and 
<PB N="161" REF="163"> demanded what he meant by that. Charles bid him a&s;k
Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein. At the&s;e words Zekiel was in a cold &s;weat, and
trembled from head to foot, and was actually upon the point of confe&s;&s;ing
the robbery when Figgins and Mr. Tadpole came up-Seeing this, Charles, in the
language of Tamerlane, bade him keep his own wicked &s;ecret, and be &s;afe;
and a&s;king Mr. Tadpole which way they intended to go to England, and being
an&s;wered by the way of O&s;tend, he advi&s;ed him, for the &s;ake of his
friend, to keep that re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Figgins plainly &s;aw there was &s;ome hidden mean|ing in this
expre&s;&s;ion, and had indeed, though he had not betrayed it, thought a little
my&s;teriou&s;ly of the <HI>tete a tete</HI> interview between Charles and
Mon|&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein; to which another circum&s;tance that occurred at
Li&s;le being added, he thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to tax Charles with want of
confidence, and pu&s;hing the matter while it was warm, he obtained from our
hero, who was the wor&s;t qualified in the world for a hypocrite, the whole
truth.</P>
<P>Figgins thanked him for his frankne&s;s, and &s;aid that in
return he would give him &s;ome intelligence relative to Ma&s;ter Zekiel that
would not a little &s;ur|pri&s;e him.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164"> He &s;aid, that being all well flu&s;hed
the night be|fore, every one &s;eemed to have his different appoint|ment. For
his part, he had made an a&s;&s;ignation with Kitty, Madame St. Vivier's maid,
which he went to keep, but, by &s;ome accident or other, mi&s;|taking the
chamber, he had certainly introduced him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Tadpole, who, it was
plain, ex|pected &s;omebody; for, upon finding it impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer
many of her que&s;tions, &s;he was at fir&s;t in manife&s;t confu&s;ion, but
&s;oon recovering her&s;elf, gave a turn to the unintelligible part of her
conver|&s;ation, and, in direct terms, made him under&s;tand that &s;he took
him for Zekiel, though what &s;he &s;aid was &s;o worded that he plainly &s;aw
this was the fir&s;t interview of that nature which had pa&s;&s;ed, and which
&s;he was evidently &s;urpri&s;ed into, owing to her ex|pectation of &s;ome
other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Taking the hint, therefore, he pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on her for
my lord, which indeed &s;poilt all his &s;cheme of plea&s;ure for the remainder
of the night, except &s;o much as gratified his curio&s;ity; for having yielded
to his embraces before matters came to be explained, &s;he took on &s;trangely,
and complained of being ruined in her &s;leep, and all the old cant of tho&s;e
ladies who are well ver&s;ed in &s;uch arts as pa&s;s off their &s;tale ware to
inexperienced young gentle|men.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165"> 
<Q REND="inline">'I topped my part,' &s;aid Figgins, 'for
learning from her all tho&s;e vows and promi&s;es which your precious brother
has made her, I confirmed them with a number of his quaint oaths, and at length
left her apparently &s;atisfied.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould not forget to mention that after I
had been &s;ometime in bed, a knocking and a voice was heard at the chamber
door, on which, in her fright, &s;he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"that is my brother, I know his voice"</Q>&mdash;'and &s;o, by the way, did I. She would have let
him in, to have witne&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tations I had made her. This however
I overruled, and after a time the brother&mdash;for I dare &s;ay it was
he&mdash;went away; but, upon putting all con&s;iderations together, I am
convinced this Mr. Tadpole is the lady's gallant, and they are trying together
to noo&s;e your brother, which, upon my &s;oul, I think, for the &s;ake of the
family, ought to be pre|vented.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles agreed to this, and &s;aid if Mr. Figgins would confront
the lady on their return&mdash;for they were now on the ramparts&mdash;he
would, in &s;pight of his inward indignation for his brother, try to un|deceive
him, and &s;o &s;ave him from this infamy, that &s;eemed to await him.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"> Figgins &s;aid he was an excellent young
man, and he would &s;econd &s;o laudable an endeavour with all his heart. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid Figgins, 'now we are on the
&s;ubject of la&s;t night, you, I find, kept my ap|pointment; for Kitty tells
me this morning that &s;ome per&s;on &s;tole into her room, whom &s;he
mi&s;|took for me, but, finding her error&mdash;but not till &s;he had
yielded&mdash;made the be&s;t of it, and hu|moured the mi&s;take.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is &s;ingular enough,' &s;aid Charles, 'I
a&s;|&s;ure you it was not I; I was much better em|ployed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Are you &s;ure of it?' &s;aid
Figgins.&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'Oh certain,' &s;aid Charles. 'My
a&s;&s;ignation was no my&s;terious one; I had no occa&s;ion to &s;hroud my
de&s;igns in darkne&s;s, for the joys I reaped were heightened by the blu&s;hes
of my mi&s;tre&s;s, which were revealed to my view by a wax taper, which I dare
&s;ay was bought for a very different cere|mony.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then by God,' &s;aid Figgins, 'it was your
brother, who dubbed me with my harlot, while J was dubbing him by anticipation
with his wife, and I am damnably mi&s;taken if he has not had &s;uch
anticipaters in the lady's favours for any time this four years.'</Q></P>
<P>This conver&s;ation brought them back to the inn, where they
found their whole benevolent de&s;ign <PB N="165" REF="167"> rendered abortive,
for Zekiel and his company had in their ab&s;ence &s;et out, and were now
&s;everal miles on their journey towards O&s;tend.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let them go,' &s;aid Figgins, 'and &s;ince the
fellow will run his no&s;e into the matrimonial gin, let him &s;queak for it;
but I hope, while I re|probate his folly, I am not glancing at any in you.
Madame St. Vivier and you are evidently upon very kind terms; I need not hint
to your good &s;en&s;e that &s;he is a mere adventurer..'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' &s;aid Charles, 'that one may plainly
&s;ee: I &s;hould like however to know her real &s;tory.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That, for your &s;ake, I have di&s;covered,'
&s;aid Figgins.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madame St. Vivier and her maid are neither more
nor le&s;s than Aimwell and Archer in the Beaux Stratagem. They are travelling
to the &s;outh of France, by the way of Lyons, which route I believe they take
&s;imply becau&s;e it is ours. On their return, by the way of Paris, Mrs. Kitty
is to be the mi&s;tre&s;s, and Madame St. Vivier the maid, and whatever they
pick up in their journey they are to go &s;nacks in. The girl acknowledges to
me that the fir&s;t idea was to trap you into a marriage, but finding we were
too knowing for them, and in facts better calculated to admini&s;ter to their
plea&s;ure than their convenience, like a <PB N="166" REF="168"> couple of
generous girls as they are, every thing it &s;eems is to be left to
our&s;elves.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Which genero&s;ity they mu&s;t not repent,'
&s;aid Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'By no means,' &s;aid Figgins; 'and if in our
way we meet with any Engli&s;h booby, not your brother, let them in God's name
profit of their good fortune.'</Q></P>
<P>This introduced &s;ome general remarks on En|gli&s;h travellers,
which Madame St. Vivier inter|rupted. Figgins acquainted her with the
di&s;covery as to her &s;cheme, and both the gentlemen a&s;&s;ured her they
would a&s;&s;i&s;t it as far as they could, without injuring their characters
as men of honour.</P>
<P>Po&s;t hor&s;es were ordered to be ready the next morning. While
they were harne&s;&s;ing, Charles having occa&s;ion to pay the civility of an
adieu to a per&s;on in power, who had done him &s;ome kindne&s;s as to his
bu&s;ine&s;s at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and other matters, had the curio&s;ity to
call him&s;elf at the po&s;t office, for he had not yet received a &s;ingle
letter from his father, though he had written &s;everal.&mdash;He was there
informed that there had been letters, but they were fetched away by a footman,
in a live|ry exactly like his own, the day before. Charmed with the&s;e
tidings, he flew back to the inn, think-that <PB N="167" REF="169"> the footman
mu&s;t have been John, who had forgot to give them to him; but how great was
his &s;urpri&s;e when John a&s;&s;ured him he had received no letters, and
offered to go back to the po&s;t-office to rectify the mi&s;take, whither they
immediately &s;et out, Figgins begging them to be expeditious, for the hor&s;es
were put to. 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;tay Charles,' added Figgins, 'I will
tell you, as &s;ure as you are alive, how the ca&s;e is. Your brother's livery
is the &s;ame as yours; he has intercepted your letters, and is now gone the

tra|vels with him, for he has not head enough him|&s;elf&mdash;has hit upon
this treacherous plan to make a breach between you and your father.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It mu&s;t be &s;o,' &s;aid Charles, 'but that

in his opinion that Figgins was a &s;incere friend, John a faithful &s;ervant,
and Zekiel a great rogue, our travellers took the road to Bru&s;|&s;els, and at
the fir&s;t &s;tage our hero wrote to Mr. De&s;&s;ein, as he had
re&s;olved.</P>
<P>As I am writing the hi&s;tory of Charles Hazard, and not a tour
on the continent, I &s;hall trouble my readers with no more than &s;uch
circum&s;tances as immediately concern that young gentleman, or lead to his
affairs, together with &s;uch minutiae as naturally produced them, and &s;uch
remarks as may &s;erve for their elucidation.</P>
<P>In conformity to the&s;e rules, I &s;hall only &s;ay that at
Bru&s;&s;els nothing happened of con&s;equence enough <PB N="170" REF="172">
for me to record except that Charles and Figgins became intimate with a young
Frenchman, named Combrie, who had &s;tollen a nun, and married her. This couple
were glad enough to have e&s;caped from France with &s;afety, without &s;taying
to accompli&s;h a de&s;ign which they had formed of getting the lady's fortune
out of the hands of a tru&s;tee, in which the church had placed it. They were
therefore little better off than in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an unbounded
&s;tock of love, and what money Mr. Combrie, who was the <HI>cadet</HI> of an
honourable family, had been able to procure from the fondne&s;s of a doating
mo|ther.</P>
<P>Having however violated one of the mo&s;t &s;acred laws of
France, by carrying a nun out of that king|dom, the mettled Frenchman conceived
he could incur but little more blame if he pu&s;hed his point &s;o far as to
take her fortune forcibly out of the hands of a litigeous <HI>procureur,</HI>
who had made u&s;e of the money to his own advantage for two years, and eluded
every attempt, even of the clergy, to get it from him.</P>
<P>The man of the law was however too vigilant and circum&s;pect
for Combrie, who being a novice in a matter which required &s;o much wary
caution and prudent re&s;olution, and be&s;ides too much <PB N="171" REF="173">
tran&s;ported with his expected happine&s;s, he ma|naged his plan &s;o
bunglingly, that &s;o far from &s;uc|ceeding with the <HI>procureur,</HI> he
had very nearly been defeated in his views concerning the lady.</P>
<P>Though this couple loved each other with perhaps more
tenderne&s;s for being without fortune, yet mo&s;t people agree, and they could
not but yield to the general opinion, that money is a &s;ecurity for love,
e&s;pecially after reflection takes place. In|deed, being in a &s;trange
country, from whence they mu&s;t &s;hortly, for the &s;ake of &s;afety, recede
further, they were not &s;o blinded by their affection, but they &s;aw that
their future pro&s;pects would be in a very doubtful way, if &s;ome &s;cheme
was not hit upon to re&s;cue the money before it could be con|fi&s;cated for
the u&s;e of the church.</P>
<P>Combrie, who had been at Bru&s;&s;els but a &s;hort time, yet
who was looked upon, in con&s;equence of his &s;hyne&s;s, as a very equivocal
character, &s;aw plainly the danger of making a confident in that place, and as
an attempt at the recovery of his wife's fortune would be impracticable,
without a confederate or two, taking a hint from the &s;trong congeniality that
appeared between the &s;entiments of our travellers and his own, he fancied he
&s;hould be &s;afe at-lea&s;t in their confidence, even if they did 
<PB N="172" REF="174"> not lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides, his affairs
were very pre&s;&s;ing, and he doubted, if his re&s;olutions were not
&s;uddenly and effectually taken, whether the all-gra&s;ping power of the
church would not deprive him of every po&s;&s;ible hope.</P>
<P>Having no time to deliberate, and being em|boldened by the
engaging freedom and true breed|ing of Charles and his friend, he ventured,
without re&s;erve, to entru&s;t them with his affairs, into which our friends
gave &s;o freely, that Figgins, who the reader knows was no mean hand at a
plot, concer|ted one that it was agreed would infallibly &s;ucceed, even
without rendering either him or his friend liable to the &s;malle&s;t
&s;u&s;picion of being concerned in it.</P>
<P>Full of their project, the three friends &s;et out, leaving
Madame Combrie in her apartments at Bru&s;&s;els, but fir&s;t &s;ending Madame
St. Vivier before them to Sedan, where &s;he actually had bu&s;ine&s;s; for as
to them&s;elves, out of &s;afety to Combrie, they travelled to Nancy in
Lorraine, where lay the &s;cene of action, by the way of Luxembourg, and, in
fact, as much in Au&s;tria as po&s;&s;ible till they &s;hould come to Metz,
where they were to hold their grand coun&s;el of war. Madame St. Vivier,
however, was not at all apprized of their bu&s;ine&s;s, but only in|&s;tructed,
<PB N="173" REF="175"> after &s;he had accompli&s;hed hers, to meet them at
Nancy, to which Sedan lies in the direct road.</P>
<P>Without &s;topping to look at a &s;ingle pro&s;pect, building,
or even crucifix, in the way, I &s;hall &s;et down my travellers at Metz,
where, by agreement, they &s;eparated, Charles and Figgins taking po&s;t
hor&s;es for Nancy, and Combrie jogging after them at his lei&s;ure, upon his
own hor&s;e: not however till they had agreed whereabout they &s;hould find him
in the &s;uburbs, near which place Combrie had a tru&s;ty friend, who he was
&s;ure would give him every nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Nancy, they went to the con|vent of Chartreux,
where &s;trangers, e&s;pecially of condition, are for a &s;hort time treated
gratis. The members of this convent being all men of fortune, and, in general,
&s;uch as have retired from the world through di&s;appointments at court, are
always charmed at the arrival of new gue&s;ts, whether their vi&s;its be owing
to curio&s;ity or nece&s;&s;ity, but they are particularly plea&s;ed with the
Engli&s;h. No wonder then that the &s;uperior, when he under&s;tood that
Charles was a young Engli&s;h nobleman, and Figgins his governor; that they had
unexpectedly been deceived as to remittances from England, and 
<PB N="174" REF="176"> therefore from actual nece&s;&s;ity had intruded on
their generous in&s;titution, both for immediate &s;uccour and advice,
in&s;tantly &s;ignified&mdash;e&s;pecially as their preten&s;ions were
corroborated by the te&s;timony of letters of credit and recommendation, and
many other authentic documents&mdash;his warme&s;t wi&s;hes to enter heartily
into their intere&s;t. They paid him a number of acknowledgments for his great
civility to &s;trangers, and &s;aid they piqued them&s;elves on their own
&s;agacity, which had pointed out the pro|priety of applying to a man of his
piety, as well as con&s;equence, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, rather than run the
ri&s;k of being impo&s;ed upon by an indi&s;cri|minate choice of a per&s;on to
&s;upply their pre&s;ent wants, without an eligible recommendation.</P>
<P>After this preface our travellers acquainted the &s;uperior that
they wi&s;hed his reference to &s;ome money negociator, for a pre&s;ent
&s;upply, who a&s;&s;ur|ing them that it would give him particular plea&s;ure
to recommend them to &s;ome per&s;on who &s;hould treat them
con&s;cientiou&s;ly, mentioned his near re|lation Mon&s;ieur Goufre, <HI>le
procureur:</HI> not however till he had expatiated on the wickedne&s;s of
tho&s;e u&s;urious wretches who take advantage of the nece&s;|&s;itous, and
oppre&s;s their fellow creatures under the idea of relieving them.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177"> Figgins &s;aid he had heard of one
Mon&s;ieur Banc|&s;ec, but the &s;uperior a&s;&s;ured them they could not get
into wor&s;e hands. Charles &s;aid certainly it would be their intere&s;t to
rely upon the &s;uperior's advice, and begged the favour of a note to
Mon|&s;ieur Goufre. This reque&s;t was immediately com|plied with, and our
friends went their ways to the gentleman's hou&s;e in que&s;tion, after
thanking the kind reclu&s;e in terms of the warme&s;t gratitude.</P>
<P>Before however we introduce the reader to Mon|&s;ieur Goufre, it
will not be inexpedient to &s;ay how Charles and his friend happened to get
recom|mended to the very man who retained Madame Combrie's fortune.</P>
<P>The reader has &s;een that he was a near relation to the
&s;uperior of the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> which was well known to Combrie, and it
will not appear extraordinary that this connection with the clergy &s;hould be
the means of Mon&s;ieur Goufre's being often employed in matters which
concerned the church. In fact, the frequent litigations by friends of the
decea&s;ed to recover monies conditionally left for charitable u&s;es, on one
&s;ide, and the a&s;&s;ertion of the church's right on the other, had, upon
many occa&s;ions, pro|duced &s;uch a &s;ee-&s;aw of intere&s;ted altercation
be|tween the <HI>procureur</HI> and the <HI>&s;uperieur,</HI> that matters 
<PB N="176" REF="178"> perfectly plain and clear in them&s;elves, often wore an
air of &s;uch my&s;terious embarra&s;&s;ment under &s;uch delu&s;ion as
frittered large legacies into bills of ex|pences, which were cunningly
&s;nacked by the law|yer and the monk.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e lucrative bones, at which they had been a long
time nibbling, was Madame Combrie's fortune, the perfect &s;ituation of which,
nay even the drawer in which it was depo&s;ited, Figgins un|dertook to procure
intelligence of; to do which, properly, they had recour&s;e to the &s;uperior,
and through him were re&s;olved to attack the heart of his relation in that
part where he was mo&s;t vulner|able&mdash;for it was not true that they
actually wanted money&mdash;and to give a colour to this it was no bad plan to
&s;eize an opportunity of taking the <HI>Char|treux</HI> by the outward
&s;ymbol of his profe&s;&s;ion, and make his charity, which was counterfeit,
the in|&s;trument of his real confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Combrie being arrived in the Fauxbourg, and informed of their
re&s;olves, the moment came to put their de&s;ign in execution. Charles and
Figgins waited on the <HI>procureur,</HI> who, after all the nece&s;&s;ary
difficulties, which, upon motion, was to be re|moved by Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein,
agreed to accommo|date them with what they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary; 
<PB N="177" REF="179"> for they had repre&s;ented that they &s;hould change
their route &s;o often, and probably from momentary in|ducements, that it would
be better to take up in &s;pecie as much as would &s;erve for &s;ome months,
and leave in the hands of Mon&s;ieur Goufre travell|ing bills of Sir James
Herries, and other Engli&s;h bankers, to the amount of the &s;um and the
di&s;|count.</P>
<P>Nothing retarded the payment of the money but waiting for a
letter from Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;ein, which at length arrived greatly to the
&s;atisfaction of all parties. It &s;poke very hand&s;omely of Charles and his
friend, and it is proper to mention that, over and above the bu&s;ine&s;s of
a&s;&s;uring Mon&s;ieur Goufre, it mentioned that letters had been &s;ent to
Charles at Li&s;le, on account of which he had written to Bru&s;|&s;els, and
this confirmed Charles in his opinion of Zekiel's treachery. Figgins however
made a dif|ferent u&s;e of this circum&s;tance, greatly turning it to their
pre&s;ent account, for he proved very clearly that if tho&s;e letters &s;ent to
Li&s;le had been received, the application to Mon&s;ieur Goufre would have been
unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>During the interval between writing to Calais and receiving an
an&s;wer, Charles and Figgins had twice dined with the <HI>procureur,</HI> and
the latter had &s;o <PB N="178" REF="180"> in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his good
graces, that under pretence of enquiring into the practice of the French laws,
he wormed out of him almo&s;t all his affairs. The endowments of the
mona&s;teries naturally came up in their conver&s;ation, in which bu&s;ine&s;s
he owned he was very much employed, and one morning, when they were talking in
the counting-hou&s;e upon this &s;ubject, the <HI>procureur</HI> &s;aid, as he
was locking up his bureau, 
<Q REND="inline">'here now is a pretty large fortune which has
been le&s;&s;ened almo&s;t one-fourth by liti|gation. It belonged to a nun, who
has been lately &s;tolen from a neighbouring mona&s;try&mdash;there it is
labelled and &s;ealed up, in notes upon the <HI>Cai&s;&s;e d'accompte, payable
au porteur&mdash;</HI>and I have now a &s;upreme order, which I &s;hall yield
to next week,&mdash;after I have made out my bill again&s;t it&mdash;to
&s;ur|renderit to the Lady Abbe&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P>Naturally gue&s;&s;ing that nuns were not &s;o fre|quently
&s;tolen but that her he had heard of mu&s;t be Madame Combrie, Figgins found
his point &s;o far gained, and now the letter being arrived from Ca|lais,
nothing remained but to receive their money.</P>
<P>On the evening appointed for this bu&s;ine&s;s, the
<HI>procureur</HI> was invited by our travellers to a &s;ump|tuous
entertainment at the Hotel <HI>D'Angleterre.&mdash;</HI>Before &s;upper the
ceremony of &s;igning and &s;ealing <PB N="179" REF="181"> was performed, and
after &s;upper all was hilarity. Figgins made the <HI>procureur</HI> harrangue,
Charles pre|vailed on him to &s;quall &s;everal <HI>chan&s;ons a boire,</HI>
and Madame St. Vivier, who arrived at Nancy that very afternoon, took him out
to walk a minuet with her. In &s;hort, the votary of chicane having made a good
bargain, a good &s;upper, and fallen violently in love with Madame St. Vivier,
did not notice how the hours wore, and was at length, after a good fini&s;h|ing
do&s;e, carried to bed, in a condition that laid him by the heels till ten
o'clock the next morning.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE LAITY PROVE TWO CUNNING FOR BOTH LAW AND
GOSPEL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was three hours after Mon&s;ieur Goufre went home before he
di&s;covered that any trick had been played him, for I hope the reader does not
&s;uppo&s;e the &s;upper was given for nothing. He a&s;ked one of the clerks if
any body had called while he was engaged the evening before, and was an&s;wered
no|body of any con&s;equence but Father Benedick.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'What Father Benedick?' &s;aid Goufre.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Him,' &s;aid the clerk, 'we &s;ent to you at
the <HI>Hotel D'An|gleterre,</HI> and by whom you &s;ent your keys, with
written orders to deliver the fortune belonging to the convent of our lady of
the a&s;cen&s;ion.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Written orders! Keys!' cried the a&s;toni&s;hed
<HI>pro|cureur.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But it is impo&s;&s;ible; here are my
keys.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well &s;ir, the&s;e are the keys he brought,'
&s;aid the clerk, 'and here is the order: &s;urely we know your hand
writing.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this Mon&s;ieur Goupe read, in a faultering 
<PB N="181" REF="183"> accent, and in a hand &s;o like his own that he could
him&s;elf find no difference: 
<Q REND="inline">'Let Father Benedick have the packet in the
bureau labelled Money belonging to the convent of our lady of the
a&s;|cen&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P>As all the French dance well, it is not wonder|ful that
Mon&s;ieur Goufre had &s;carcely read the&s;e words when he took a
<HI>cha&s;&s;ee</HI> to the bureau, where he di&s;covered the ne&s;t without
the bird, <HI>caprioled</HI> back to the parlour for his hat and cane,
<HI>rigadooned</HI> to the door, <HI>bri&s;eed</HI> out of it, and in a new
fa&s;hioned <HI>pas courant</HI> pre&s;ently made an <HI>entre</HI> at the
hou&s;e of the general of the police. There being joined by a proper number of
figurants, under the characters of <HI>&s;ergeants du ville, archets,</HI> and
<HI>pou&s;e culs,</HI> the <HI>procu|reur</HI> paraded at their head to the
<HI>Hotel D'Angleterre,</HI> where, to enrich the proce&s;&s;ion back again, he
en|treated our hero, Figgins, and Madame St. Vivier to perform a <HI>pas de
trois.</HI></P>
<P>In plain Engli&s;h, he fairly believed his pocked had been
picked while he was a&s;leep, and that our travellers, who were thieves, had
taken this me|thod to rob him; and having imparted the&s;e &s;u&s;|picions to
the general of the police, he obtained an order to bring the delinquents before
him.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184"> A few words however &s;erved to convince
that of|ficer, and even the <HI>procureur</HI> him&s;elf, that his
&s;u&s;|picions were groundle&s;s. The clerk depo&s;ed that about &s;even
o'clock in the evening, a per&s;on in the garb of a friar, calling him&s;elf
Father Benedick, came to their hou&s;e, and &s;aid he had particular
bu|&s;ine&s;s with Mon&s;ieur Goufre, relative to a certain fortune belonging
to the convent of our lady of the a&s;cen&s;ion. He repre&s;ented that upon
various pre|tences it had been &s;o long kept out of the church's hands, that
it was in agitation to procure a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the <HI>procureur's</HI>
employments, if he &s;hould refu&s;e immediately to deliver it. He &s;aid it
was pity Mon&s;ieur Goufre was not within, for his au|thority was &s;o powerful
and deci&s;ive, that if he re|turned it would be with force, which he would
willingly avoid. The clerk &s;aid, in con&s;equence of the&s;e menaces, he made
no &s;cruple of &s;ending the &s;uppo&s;ed friar to his ma&s;ter, who, about a
quar|ter before eight, returned with Mon&s;ieur Goufre's keys, and a written
order to deliver the fortune which was locked up in the bureau, and which had a
label &s;imilar to that de&s;cribed in the &s;aid written order. The clerk
&s;wore he believed it to be the hand writing of his ma&s;ter, and he was
&s;ure the keys were tho&s;e his ma&s;ter then held in his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185"> Mr. Figgins here entreated that he might
have permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;k the <HI>procureur</HI> a few que&s;tions, which
reque&s;t being complied with, he &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray &s;ir in who&s;e company were you from
half pa&s;t &s;ix o'clock till nine, during which time this fraud is &s;aid to
have been committed?'</Q></P>
<P> Mon&s;ieur Goufre an&s;wered in his company.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'Were you not,' &s;aid Figgins, 'during that
whole time, in your &s;ober &s;en&s;es?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perfectly,' an|&s;wered the man of law.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And now let me rou&s;e your be&s;t recollection
while I a&s;k if in that very interval of time, you were not talking of your
ex|ten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s, of your property, and indeed of this very fortune
you now &s;ay you have lo&s;t, but which you then bragged you had &s;afely
locked up; as a proof of which you &s;hewed us tho&s;e very keys, and at the
very time as it &s;hould &s;eem, that your clerk was u&s;ing them&mdash;which
is a very likely &s;tory&mdash;to deliver that fortune up to a per&s;on he had
never before &s;een.'</Q></P>
<P>The poor <HI>procureur</HI> felt this unan&s;werable mode of
rea&s;oning mo&s;t &s;everely, and the general of the po|lice&mdash;whether
other ca&s;es had induced him to doubt the veracity of Mon&s;ieur Goufre, or
whether he was con&s;cious that Engli&s;hmen are con&s;tantly upon the&s;e
occa&s;ions not tho&s;e who dupe, but tho&s;e who <PB N="184" REF="186"> are
duped&mdash;&s;eemed to pay great attention to Fig|gins's harrangue, who
&s;eeing his advantage, thought he could not do better than follow it up: which
he did in the&s;e words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon the whole, it appears to me, and &s;o it
&s;hall to the Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador, that Mon&s;ieur Goufre having found in
us a pretty free-milch cow, as to &s;ome money tran&s;actions we have had
toge|ther, has fancied, notwith&s;tanding the documents we have produced, that
we could not make good our preten&s;ions to rank and independency, and
therefore imagined we might be awed, by the ac|cu&s;ation of a &s;ham robbery,
into a compo&s;ition: and this appears from many circum&s;tances.&mdash;What
had we to do with this fortune? Why were we to know in what place it lay? Why
have we been repeatedly &s;hewn the key that locked it up? Be&s;ides, the
matter has been &s;o bunglingly managed, that the clerk depo&s;es that very key
was &s;ent at the individual time he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es to have had it in
his pocket. Then he does not pretend to &s;ay that the hand writing is not like
his, but, on the contrary, &s;o like that he &s;hould have taken it for his
own. But it was nece&s;&s;ary this &s;hould be &s;aid, becau&s;e if the hand
writing had not been exactly like his, the clerk would have had no pretence
whatever to have delivered the <PB N="185" REF="187"> fortune. Again, what was
this &s;ame Father Be|nedick?&mdash;and how had he got all this intelligence?
How in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his pocket invi&s;ibly, and conveyed away the
keys, during an interval of perhaps the only five minutes in an hour and a half
that they had been tru&s;ted there without his hand upon them for their
&s;ecurity; but, at any rate, to make the &s;tory in the &s;malle&s;t degree
colourable, what connection had this &s;uppo&s;ed Father Benedick with them, to
lend the &s;malle&s;t probability to their being concerned in a tran&s;|action
&s;o very derogatory to their honour as gen|tlemen, &s;o totally
unnece&s;&s;ary to their circum|&s;tances, which Mon&s;ieur Goufre had taken
care, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, to make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter
of&mdash;and &s;o di&s;graceful to the name of Engli&s;hmen? How had it been
proved that they, &s;o far from knowing the friar in que&s;tion, had a &s;ingle
a&s;&s;ociate, even of their own country?&mdash;for both the clerks gave very
clear te&s;timony that Father Benedick &s;poke with an accent &s;o pure and
vernacular, that they were &s;ure he was a French|man: and indeed &s;o he was.
All the&s;e circum|&s;tances con&s;idered, it was impo&s;&s;ible this affair
&s;hould be otherwi&s;e than a gro&s;s attempt&mdash;an event which occurred
too frequently&mdash;to impo&s;e upon Engli&s;h credulity; which, however
others <PB N="186" REF="188"> might pa&s;s over, would not, in the pre&s;ent
in|&s;tance, be regarded in any light either trifling or pardonable; on the
contrary, it would be found that men of character had been tampered with, who
were both able and willing to right them&s;elves. He therefore in&s;i&s;ted,
for the &s;ake of general ju&s;|tice and the honour of the Engli&s;h nation,
that the matter &s;hould be fully and publicly inve&s;tigated: to which and
they would be content to &s;ubmit to a temporary impri&s;onment, provided
Mon&s;ieur Goufre &s;hould be laid under the &s;ame re&s;tric|tion.'</Q></P>
<P>The general of the police, whou could not pro|bably &s;ee that
all this intelligence had been, by the mo&s;t &s;ubtle train of artful
in&s;inuation, deliberately drawn from Goufre, by Figgins, with a view to
forward the de&s;igns of Combrie&mdash;who the reader &s;ees was father
Benedick&mdash;had no manner of doubt but that every word he had heard was
truth.</P>
<P>His own private opinion indeed was, that being in a &s;hort time
to deliver up the fortune, the <HI>procu|reur</HI> had conjured up the whole
accu&s;ation to cover his embezzlement of the money. As to the friar, he had
not the lea&s;t doubt but that he was a real character, procured probably by
his relation, the &s;uperior of the Chartreux, who, as we have &s;aid 
<PB N="187" REF="189"> was occa&s;ionally concerned with Mr. Goufre in his law
practices.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he &s;o well knew, as he thought, the trim of the
bu&s;ine&s;s, that he would not have he&s;i|tated to comply with the terms of
Mr. Figgins, had he not had &s;ome very material objections to get rid of.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, he well knew that their know|ledge of each
others illicit conduct was mutual; they had trod together the paths of
oppre&s;&s;ion; and it was their con&s;tant cu&s;tom when either was likely to
get into a &s;crape, to call the other to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, however, the <HI>procureur</HI> had pre|viou&s;ly &s;worn to
the general of the police that he had actually been robbed, and this was indeed
the truth; but matters&mdash;thanks to Figgins's addre&s;s&mdash;wore now &s;o
different an a&s;pect, that this &s;eeming want of confidence quite
exa&s;perated him, and no|thing but his own actual &s;afety made him he&s;itate
a moment to take part again&s;t the <HI>procureur.</HI></P>
<P>Balancing thus between his conviction and his intere&s;t, he
thought proper to pur&s;ue a middle cour&s;e. He &s;aid, as there had actually
been no|thing proved which had been alledged, he could not an&s;wer &s;ending
to pri&s;on three per&s;ons, one of <PB N="188" REF="190"> them a lady, who had
made &s;o hand&s;ome a defence. Mon&s;ieur Goufre had certainly, in the fir&s;t
tran&s;|ports of his re&s;entment, done what he thought very ju&s;tifiable, but
what, upon reflection, had neither certainty, nor even probability, to
&s;upport it; that it was plain he had been &s;ome way or other tricked, how
would very likely hereafter appear; and, if he had been too warm, &s;tung as he
was at being de|prived of a large depo&s;ite, which it would cut deep into his
fortune to make good, tho&s;e very traits of liberality on which that
gentleman&mdash;meaning Fig|gins&mdash;had dwelt, would, he hoped, induce him
and his friend to overlook &s;urely a very pardonable error.</P>
<P>Charles &s;aid, Mon&s;ieur Goufre's mad manner of rectifying a
mi&s;take, he thought, de&s;erved no lenity at their hands. For his part he
&s;hould dete&s;t the idea of patching up a matter that &s;truck &s;o hard in
him at the honour of every young nobleman on his travels. He &s;hould think, if
he pa&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a glaring impertinence, every one of his Engli&s;h
ac|quaintance ought to re&s;ent it. He &s;hould therefore acquaint the
Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador, who was his fa|ther's particular friend, of the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out the &s;malle&s;t re&s;erve; and if he mu&s;t endure to
have a hated liberty forced upon him, he would at lea&s;t, let his
inconvenience be what it might, &s;tay <PB N="189" REF="191"> in that town till
not only him&s;elf and his friend &s;hould be hand&s;omely cleared, but till he
who had the audacity to &s;candalize their characters &s;hould meet with his
merited puni&s;hment. So &s;aying, he gave the lady his hand, and &s;aid if
their forms would admit it he &s;hould chu&s;e to go from that place, but that
he &s;hould be found at the <HI>Hotel D'Angleterre</HI> till the matter was
finally decided.</P>
<P>They were followed out by the general of the po|lice, who
whi&s;pered Figgins, in the hall, that he plainly &s;aw Mon&s;ieur Goufre had
done a ra&s;h thing, but that it need not hinder them from pur&s;uing their
tour, for if they would leave twenty guineas in his hands, he would take care
as much ju&s;tice &s;hould be done to their honour as if they were
pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>In this I verily believe he &s;poke truth, but Fig|gins cut him
&s;hort with this reply:</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, If the law has any power over us, u&s;e it
now you have us in your cu&s;tody; if not, the be&s;t of you &s;hall have
rea&s;on to repent this outrage: and as to leaving twenty guineas in your
hands, I would do it with great plea&s;ure, were I not un|luckily bound by a
vow not to tru&s;t any French|man further than I can &s;ee him.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"> The general of the police &s;aid it was a
great pity &s;o good an opportunity &s;hould be lo&s;t, and added that perhaps
the young gentleman was not bound by the vow.</P>
<P>Charles &s;aid he was always bound by the deter|minations of his
governor, e&s;pecially when they went to a prevention of his being duped.</P>
<P>The general of the police not thinking fit to urge the matter
any farther, after many reverences, retired to the <HI>procureur;</HI> after
which our travellers departed, fir&s;t giving the officers of ju&s;tice
&s;ome|thing to drink.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Goufre was found by his friend in a &s;tate of
di&s;traction. The latter however believed it all put on, and began very
&s;everely to upbraid him with his duplicity, and to blame him for having made
&s;uch a fool of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>procureur</HI> &s;wore that he had been robbed, and was
ruined, and confirmed the oath with a hundred others. He was unfortunate enough
however to gain no manner of credit; on the contrary, the general of the police
told him, in &s;o many words, that &s;ince he was above placing confidence in
his <PB N="191" REF="193"> friends, he &s;incerely wi&s;hed the Engli&s;hmen
might trounce him.</P>
<P>This introduced a warm bout at alternate recri|mination, till at
length both became cool, and they determined, in conjunction with the
&s;uperior of the Chartreux, to take an early opportunity of delibe|rating on
the mo&s;t expedient means to get out of &s;uch a di&s;agreeable &s;crape.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>AN EXPLANATORY LETTER&mdash;A LITTLE VEXATION&mdash;AND A
JOURNEY TO LYONS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MADAME St. Vivier had not the &s;malle&s;t idea that her
companions really knew any thing of the fraud. She had acted her part to
perfection the night before, as to making Mon&s;ieur Goufre drunk and
ridicu|lous, but was ignorant that the trick went any fur|ther than getting
good terms from him as to the money that was borrowed; neither had a &s;yllable
of the &s;ituation of Madame Combrie been explained to her; for it is natural
to &s;uppo&s;e our travellers did not &s;o &s;in again&s;t good breeding as to
introduce &s;uch a character into that lady's company. She might be &s;ent
purpo&s;ely to Dover, and probably was in|tended to be played off as a
<HI>corps de re&s;erve</HI> upon our hero, but when no direct outrage on
propriety was nece&s;&s;ary, Mr. Figgins was too great a general to call in
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when every thing went on even beyond his wi&s;hes. But how
beyond his wi&s;hes? Patience, dear reader: I would not have you know 
<PB N="193" REF="195"> what is brewing, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, for any
con&s;idera|tion. Attend then, and let the fruit of your curio|&s;ity ripen by
degrees; nor&mdash;that it may have the better reli&s;h&mdash;wi&s;h to gather
it till it &s;hall be ready to drop into your hand.</P>
<P>Four or five days after the affair of the general of the police,
the <HI>procureur</HI> waited on our travellers, with great deference and
re&s;pect, and informed them that he had received a letter which had
&s;ati&s;|fied him in every point relative to the fraud. He therefore acquitted
them &s;o heartily of any concern in that matter, that he appeared extremely
&s;hocked at his conduct, and &s;aid he would publi&s;h their in|nocence
coupled with any acknowledgment of his own, by way of conce&s;&s;ion, that they
&s;hould think proper to dictate. As to him&s;elf, he had the plea|&s;ure to
inform them that as it was now known he had not been to blame, at the mediation
of his re|lation the &s;uperior of the Chartreux, and his friend the general of
the police, the chapter of the con|vent to which the money was due had remitted
the payment of it till his death, provided he would then add the intere&s;t of
it, and an additional be|que&s;t of ten thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>The letter to Mon&s;ieur Goufre was as follows:&mdash;
<PB N="194" REF="196"> 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MONSIEUR GOUFRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Le&s;t your clerks, or any other innocent per&s;ons,
&s;hould &s;uffer under the &s;u&s;picion of having taken from your bureau that
fortune which in ju&s;tice and equity is mine, in right of my wife, I write
this to acquaint you that, on Friday even|ing la&s;t, about &s;even o'clock, I
called at your hou&s;e, habited like a friar, and, under the name of Father
Benedick, demanded the fortune in your hands belonging to the convent of our
lady of the a&s;cen&s;ion; intimating that if I did not &s;ee you, be where you
might, I &s;hould return pre|pared to compel you to re&s;ign it. Your clerks
referred me to you at the <HI>Hotel D'Angleterre,</HI> from whence I feigned to
return at about a quarter be|fore eight, bringing with me a written order, as
if from you&mdash;a duplicate of which I have enclo&s;ed, to &s;hew you how
well I counterfeited your hand writing&mdash;and a bunch of keys, one of which
opened your bureau. One of your clerks, &s;o completely impo&s;ed upon,
naturally gave me what I wanted. I immediately departed, derobed my|&s;elf of
my holy accoutrements, mounted my hor&s;e, and rode through bye-ways till I
arrived at Rouen <PB N="195" REF="197">&mdash;fir&s;t taking care to touch the
<HI>'Argent Comptant,</HI> which, as you know, I was ea&s;ily enable to do, as
the whole fortune was in notes on the <HI>Cai&s;&s;e d'ac|compte</HI> at Paris,
payable <HI>au porteur&mdash;</HI>from whence, when I &s;hall have put this
letter in the po&s;t, a ve&s;&s;el will carry me to Guern&s;ey, and, before it
can reach you, I &s;hall be in England.</P>
<P> It may not be ami&s;s to tell you that the key which opened
your bureau I cau&s;ed to be made from your own, for which purpo&s;e I took
care to be very much about you, before I &s;tole my dear Araminta from her
hypocritical directre&s;s. I knew it always accompanied four others, the &s;ize
of which did not e&s;cape my notice: two of them open che&s;ts, one a &s;mall
cabinet, and the lea&s;t a ca&s;ket.</P>
<P> All the&s;e matters lent &s;uch &s;trong probability to my
&s;tory, with which my holy garb &s;o well agreed&mdash;a garb which was never
u&s;ed to a wor|thier purpo&s;e&mdash;that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me not to
&s;ucceed.</P>
<P> If this confe&s;&s;ion will do you any good with the
church, you are welcome to make what u&s;e of it you think proper. As to
my&s;elf, I &s;hall glory in its publication, for I am &s;ure the money 
<PB N="196" REF="198"> that &s;erves to maintain an hone&s;t pair, who&s;e
views are honourable and their actions exemplary&mdash;but more e&s;pecially as
that money is their right&mdash;is more worthily, nay more religiou&s;ly
applied than in fattening and encouraging in li|centiou&s;ne&s;s tho&s;e
&s;lothful drones who, as you and I know, &s;hut them&s;elves up from the world
not to cheri&s;h holine&s;s, but to hide profligacy.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>From Yours, &amp;c. COMBRIE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter, which &s;peaks &s;o plain, completes the account of
Figgins's &s;cheme, which I have thus piece-meal explained to the reader. The
circum|&s;tance of the keys, which was a fact, together with the knack which
Combrie had of imitating Goufre's hand writing,&mdash;which indeed is not
difficult, for al|mo&s;t all Frenchmen write alike&mdash;gave a hint of it, and
the idea of an application to the &s;uperior of the Chartreux, and all tho&s;e
concurrent circum&s;tances which we have &s;een &s;o well managed, could not
fail to crown it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This hi&s;tory then has &s;o far acted in its cu&s;tomary
province as to make one couple happy already. How long they are to continue
&s;o, it is not im|po&s;&s;ible <PB N="197" REF="199"> but we may hereafter
have occa&s;ion to no|tice.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be &s;een that this affair ended greatly to the
honour of our travellers, who, in con&s;e|quence, attracted the notice of all
the Engli&s;h who then re&s;ided at Nancy. Among the re&s;t they were vi&s;ited
by a gentleman, who&s;e company, as a plain &s;traight-forward, well-meaning
man, was very a|greeable to them. He &s;erved admirably well to make one at a
party of whi&s;t, and for a cur&s;ory ac|quaintance really was not without his
merit.</P>
<P>A very &s;hort time however let them into the cha|racter of this
new acquaintance, who&s;e name was Ireland; for one night, being at whi&s;t,
with Mr. Figgins for his partner, Charles was &s;o tantalized into betting, and
confu&s;ed off his guard, that he got up from the table an hundred and fifty
pounds lo&s;er, in &s;pight of all the hints and expo&s;tulations of Fig|gins,
who only played for crowns.</P>
<P>The next day he heard, from undoubted autho|rity, that Mr.
Ireland was an errant &s;harper, and had e&s;caped from England after killing a
gentle|man in a duel, who had dared to tax him publicly with a palpable
fraud.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200"> This lo&s;s however had one good effect
upon our hero, for he made a mo&s;t &s;olemn vow never again to lo&s;e five
pounds at one &s;itting, which re&s;olution he inviolably kept to the day of
his death.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid very little of Charles's continual
di&s;|appointments, at not receiving letters from his fa|ther, or indeed any
body el&s;e, &s;ince his departure from England. The truth is that it gave him
in|expre&s;&s;ible concern, and occa&s;ioned from him many and various
remon&s;trances, which were apparently very little heeded.</P>
<P>Figgins te&s;tified as much unea&s;ine&s;s as our hero, but upon
this, as well as every other &s;ubject, he comforted him by a variety of
arguments. He &s;aid it very often occurred that people on a tour mi&s;&s;ed of
their letters, though at length they came &s;afely to hand; that at Nancy, for
example, it was &s;ome|times three weeks before a man could write a letter and
receive an an&s;wer to it; and this inconvenience would encrea&s;e in
proportion as they went farther. There was no doubt, he &s;aid, but every thing
would fall upon its legs, and the letters would all come together in a lump,
and he cheerfully agreed to wait at Lyons till every proper explanation could
be mutually exchanged, not only as to Charles and his father, but every other
corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"> This kind accommodation in Figgins gave
our hero great plea&s;ure. He had really, at times, felt very unplea&s;antly on
this &s;ubject, and though he could account for his di&s;appointment at
Li&s;le, yet more than two months had elap&s;ed &s;ince that time, during which
interval he had repeatedly written in &s;uch a full and &s;atisfactory manner,
that he could not bear to reflect on the parting between him and his father,
and, at the &s;ame time, hold in mind that all his attempts to learn the
&s;tate of that ami|able parent's mind were continually baffled. He knew not
what might have happened in his ab|&s;ence: he had dreaded to leave him: nay he
would not think on the &s;ubject, it was dreadful to him! yet he could not give
a rea&s;on for it. Who knew but the letters received at Li&s;le, &s;ince he had
heard nothing afterwards, might give an account of an unfavourable alteration
in his father's health: per|haps they contained a tender injunction to come and
clo&s;e the dying eyes of an indulgent parent: per|haps he was then dead, and
the letters were from friends who gave him the melancholy news, which his
perfidious brother had received with a trium|phant and cruel joy.</P>
<P>Reflections like the&s;e greatly embittered the en|joyments of
our hero, and though I have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;ent the
reader with any <PB N="200" REF="202"> thing but the agreeable &s;ide of the
picture, yet it is certainly true that Charles had his moments when he felt
very &s;evere and bitter unhappine&s;s; nay he had once very nearly determined
to return to Calais, the better to inve&s;tigate this unplea&s;ant
bu&s;ine&s;s, though the natural gaiety, and I will &s;ay hone&s;ty, of his
di&s;po&s;ition, prevented his particular griefs from interfering with
plea&s;ures in which others were concerned. What wonder then if the kind
con&s;oling advice of Figgins kept his mind in that tranquillity which made it
impo&s;&s;ible for an un|concerned per&s;on to penetrate his chagrin.</P>
<P>I have conceived it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay thus much, le&s;t the
reader &s;hould think our hero had, in imita|tion of &s;ome other heroes, left
his feeling in his own country, and that his foreign freaks&mdash;every one of
which I undertake to contend had a defen&s;i|ble motive&mdash;were merely the
common effect of that fa&s;hionable conceit and &s;upercilious levity which are
the qualities the French have, in general, a right to take as a &s;ample of
Engli&s;h manners.</P>
<P>All affairs at Nancy being properly &s;ettled, Charles began to
be very impatient for their de|parture to Lyons. Before they &s;et out,
however, he drew up a recapitulation of all his other letters, to which he
added many earne&s;t entreaties; and, <PB N="201" REF="203"> that it might be
&s;ure to go &s;afe, entru&s;ted it to the care of Figgins him&s;elf, who
in&s;i&s;ted upon putting it in the po&s;t office, &s;wearing he began to
&s;u&s;pect every body; and, when he returned, &s;aid that Ma&s;ter John
&s;hould not be &s;o confidently tru&s;ted for the future. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why &s;o?' &s;aid Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay no great matter,' an&s;wered Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I begin to have my &s;u&s;picions of him: but
perhaps the&s;e devils of women have corrupted him.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles a&s;ked his friend what induced his &s;u&s;pi|cions.
Figgins &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'I caught the ra&s;cal in a lie, that is all:
which I cannot bear. Dam'me if there is &s;o pimping a thing upon earth as an
un|nece&s;&s;ary lie.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'From a per&s;on in whom you place confidence,'
&s;aid Charles, 'there cannot be a crime of &s;uch magnitude. As death is
better than torture, &s;o open enmity is better than hid|den deceit. Even a
trifling lie, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, may conceal the mo&s;t tremendous
con&s;e|quences. For my part, I look upon plain inte|grity to be &s;o
po&s;itively e&s;&s;ential in the compo&s;i|tion of a friend, that though I
were one ma&s;s of imperfections, I would forgive the continual rei|teration of
them, both to my&s;elf and the world, rather than they &s;hould be
hyperbolically glo&s;&s;ed over. On the contrary, if I thought the man I 
<PB N="202" REF="204"> tru&s;ted could even meditate a wi&s;h to deceive me,
let my partiality be what it might, I would tear him from my heart, even though
it &s;hould bur&s;t in making the effort.'</Q></P>
<P>Figgins, who had eyed our hero with extraordi|nary tokens of
amazement, while he animatedly pronounced the&s;e words, fir&s;t looked pale,
then red, but recovered however in time to put in for his &s;hare of this
hone&s;t opinion; and, after an eulo|gium on Charles's way of thinking, and
reflecting on John, who alone he cho&s;e to under&s;tand as the per|&s;on all
this warmth was levelled at, he fini&s;hed his remark with 
<Q REND="inline">'Damn the fellow, I &s;hould be &s;orry to find
him a ra&s;cal, for I have a regard for him.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles certainly had no particular meaning in the words he had
uttered, but his di&s;appointment at not hearing from his father gave him
occa&s;ionally a kind of peevi&s;h di&s;content, as if he found &s;ome|body had
deceived him, though he knew not who. As a proof that he had not the
&s;malle&s;t mi&s;tru&s;t of Figgins, he entru&s;ted him, as we have ju&s;t
&s;een, with his letter to put in the po&s;t office; yet he was &s;carcely gone
but he wi&s;hed he had taken it him&s;elf: though he &s;incerely believed this
wi&s;h a tacit, though an involuntary, inju&s;tice to his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"> The contents of his letter next were gone
over in his mind, in which he found nothing but a repe|tition of
di&s;appointments, that, for ought he knew, would be rewarded with new ones;
e&s;pecially as he was confident, in his own mind, they originated in &s;ome
&s;ecret cau&s;e which he had not been, nor &s;hould ever be perhaps, able to
penetrate. In this trim of thinking, when Figgins returned and dropt tho&s;e
hints concerning John, out came the very &s;oul of our hero, and &s;o it would
have done had his own ruin been the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Figgins&mdash;for what rea&s;on perhaps the reader may
conceive&mdash;verily believed this thru&s;t was at him, and though he not only
&s;aw he had well parried it, but, as he firmly believed, di&s;armed his young
friend of all &s;u&s;picion, yet he feared, that &s;hould he take in his head
to arm him&s;elf frequently with the&s;e im|patient doubts, as he did not want
for &s;kill in the&s;e &s;ort of conflicts, he, Figgins, might one day or other
receive &s;uch a hit as might prove a mortal &s;tab to all his hopes of
bringing tho&s;e &s;chemes to bear which he certainly, for &s;ome rea&s;on or
other, was concerting; for though I have con&s;tantly allowed that Charles was
credulous, he could not be gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon; and no man knew this
better than Figgins, who, with all his management, would not have been able
ea&s;ily to gain his ends, which <PB N="204" REF="206"> were now&mdash;though
the reader, as I have &s;aid, mu&s;t wait with patience to know
how&mdash;nearly accom|pli&s;hed, had not a &s;eries of unexpected events
con|curred to give him a helping hand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>FULL OF INTERESTING MATTER&mdash;AND, AMONG THE REST, TWO
DEATHS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR travellers arrived at Lyons after a &s;afe and plea&s;ant
journey. They vi&s;ited every thing curious, were frequently at the play, made
acquaintance with men of condition and ta&s;te, and, in &s;hort, here, as in
other places, availed them&s;elves of every opportunity of improvement: thus
fulfilling the real purpo&s;es of travelling.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters however I have even le&s;s time to particularize
here than I had heretofore, and therefore &s;hall leave to the readers
imagination what was the employment of a young man and his governor who were
really ambitious of returning home with as much knowledge as they could pick
up, but which acqui&s;ition Charles in particular&mdash;as the reader &s;hall
hear&mdash;became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Our hero, walking one day in a field beyond the ramparts, was
meditating on a &s;mall book, in the <PB N="206" REF="208"> mid&s;t of a grove,
when he heard behind him a ru&s;tling. Directing his eyes to the place from
whence the noi&s;e i&s;&s;ued, he &s;aw two men very warmly attacking each
other with drawn &s;words. In the impetuo&s;ity of his fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations,
he bounded like a fawn to the place, and drawing to part the combatants, one of
them, like Mercutio, was hurt under our hero's arm. He faultered out 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Oh Je&s;u Je &s;uis mort!</HI>'</Q> and
fell down.</P>
<P>Charles was &s;o dreadfully &s;hocked at this acci|dent, that he
thought of nothing but endeavouring to &s;uccour the wounded per&s;on, on which
chari|table employ he was &s;o intent, that he did not pay the &s;malle&s;t
regard to the other, who, upon &s;eeing his antagoni&s;t drop, fled with the
fwifte&s;t precipi|tation.</P>
<P>A moment's recollection convinced our hero that he was in a
mo&s;t &s;ingularly perilous &s;ituation. The poor wounded wretch &s;eemed to
be dying, and every circum&s;tance would &s;erve to make it believed that he
was the murderer. Neverthele&s;s, his &s;trong humanity &s;o prevailed over his
prudence, that he ran without the wood, and holloed to the centinel upon the
ramparts for help, telling him there was a man dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"> Several gentlemen who were walking on the
ram|parts pre&s;ently came up, to whom Charles related, but not without much
confu&s;ion&mdash;for he was mo&s;t exceedingly affected&mdash;the whole matter
as it had pa&s;&s;ed. Unfortunately his relation gained very little credit.
They all knew the nature of duelling, and naturally imagined a prudent per&s;on
would, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, go another way rather than interfere with two
men who were agreed upon fairly deciding a quarrel by the law of arms.</P>
<P>Charles was a&s;toni&s;hed when he under&s;tood their
&s;u&s;picions, and could not help a&s;king, with &s;ome di&s;dain, whether the
French always requited the good offices of &s;trangers in the &s;ame manner.
One or two of the gentlemen took heat at this, and &s;aid he &s;hould an&s;wer
every thing at large before the general of the police.</P>
<P>Charles treated their menaces with perfect in|difference,
relying upon the te&s;timony of the dying man, who however left his protector
in the lurch; for after an ineffectual attempt to &s;peak, he pointed to
Charles, and falling backward, expired.</P>
<P>This action was univer&s;ally allowed to have been intended as a
&s;ign to di&s;tingui&s;h the murderer, and what &s;trongly corroborated the
general opinion was <PB N="208" REF="210"> our hero's &s;word, which was very
much &s;tained with blood. It was in vain that he accounted very na|turally for
this circum&s;tance, by &s;aying that when he fir&s;t &s;aw the dead man fall,
he abandoned his &s;word, the better to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that of
cour&s;e, as it lay, the blood, which ran in a &s;tream, had fallen upon
it.</P>
<P>This was con&s;trued into cunning and art. In &s;hort, the guard
arrived, and he was conducted to the hou&s;e of the general of the police,
comforted however with 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Courage! on pardon en France un coup de
vivacite.</HI>'</Q> In &s;pight however of the&s;e com|fortable tidings,
Figgins, who had been waiting for our hero to breakfa&s;t at their inn, was
very &s;oon &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t with him in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Figgins in&s;i&s;ted upon it, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that
it was impo&s;&s;ible his friend could be concerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s
otherwi&s;e than as an accidental me|diator. The gentleman who had fallen was a
man of &s;ome con&s;ideration, re&s;ident in that place, where Charles was an
ab&s;olute &s;tranger, and had not the &s;malle&s;t acquaintance. He offered to
&s;wear that, till this unhappy morning, he had never been a &s;ingle ten
minutes out of his company &s;ince his ar|rival in Lyons, and how could &s;o
&s;erious a quarrel have engendered without previous malice?&mdash;with|out 
<PB N="209" REF="211"> the &s;malle&s;t acquaintance with the unfortunate
per&s;on, or even knowledge that any &s;uch man had exi&s;tence? He maintained
there was not upon earth a le&s;s turbulent &s;pirit than his friend; that his
di&s;po&s;ition was the &s;weete&s;t, milde&s;t, mo&s;t benig|nant, in the
world; that there could not be in na|ture a more benevolent heart. He would
an&s;wer with his life that, was the fact as they &s;u&s;pected, his young
friend had not the &s;oul to be guilty of &s;uch low, &s;uch treacherous
ba&s;ene&s;s as to di&s;own it. On the contrary, as no laws were &s;o lenient,
as to accidental rencounters, as tho&s;e of France, &s;o far from denying what
had happened, he would feel enough at having been the de&s;truction of a fellow
creature, however unintentionally, without adding guilt to misfortune, by
excu&s;ing him&s;elf at the ex|pence of a wilful lie.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e arguments, Figgins in&s;i&s;ted that they had
not con&s;ulted even common probability in this bu&s;ine&s;s. His friend had
averred that the murderer fled. Who was he then? No people were &s;o remarkably
provident as to who went and came as the French. Let the book of the general of
the police be con&s;ulted, and &s;ee who had retired from the town. If he was a
&s;ettler, it would ea&s;ily be known; if a &s;tranger, intelligence of him
might be gathered at the place where he lodged. As to the <PB N="210" REF="212"> action of the dying man, he was a&s;&s;ured it had been intended to
point out his friend as one who had endeavoured to pre&s;erve him. In &s;hort,
he &s;aid let the matter but have time, and be maturely inve&s;ti|gated, and he
would re&s;ign him&s;elf as an accom|plice, and willingly await the &s;ame
fate: &s;taking his own life upon the i&s;&s;ue of his friend's inno|cence.</P>
<P>This manly and noble &s;peech, which was made in pre&s;ence of
&s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people of Lyons, had its effect. It was
warmly agreed, even by the relations of the decea&s;ed&mdash;who, by the bye,
got a fortune by his death&mdash;that every thing ought to be well
con&s;idered. Accordingly, the term of &s;ix weeks was fixed to make all the
nece&s;|&s;ary enquiries, at which time it was intended, if nothing happened to
exculpate our hero, that he &s;hould be brought to trial.</P>
<P>It was now the bu&s;ine&s;s of Figgins to alleviate, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his friend.&mdash;he had however very
little comfort for him. It had been found that a &s;tranger had actually
ab|&s;conded on the very morning this &s;ad affair hap|pened, but as the inland
towns in France are not &s;o particular as to mere &s;trangers as the
&s;ea-ports, he could not learn his name. He a&s;ked Charles if he 
<PB N="211" REF="213"> had no idea who the murderer was. Charles &s;aid he had
&s;carcely given him a &s;ingle look, &s;o in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly was the
mi&s;chief done; and that from that moment he had not &s;een him at all, his
whole care having been directed towards the dying man: but, notwith&s;tanding
all the&s;e di&s;advantages, he was &s;ure he had &s;omewhere &s;een him,
though it was then utterly out of his power to recollect when or where.</P>
<P>In a few days after the impri&s;onment of our hero, Figgins came
to him and &s;aid he was greatly afraid there was &s;ome damned plot in the
bu&s;ine&s;s, for that the women were gone off, and had taken John with
them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What plot can there be?' &s;aid Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'In this &s;ituation they are tired of us, and
re&s;olved to &s;hift for them&s;elves: a very common re&s;olution for
creatures of their &s;tamp.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True,' &s;aid Fig|gins, 'but how will you
reconcile the conduct of Mr. John? I will tell you what has lately &s;truck
me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What?' &s;aid Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why,' an&s;wered Figgins, 'that this &s;ame
Madame St. Vivier is known to Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, and, if &s;o, there is no
mi&s;chief, however dete&s;table, but you may apprehend. That woman has the
hypocri&s;y of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> crocodile, the
heart of a tygre&s;s, and the malic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="212" REF="214"> of the devil. She delights in mi&s;chief; it &s;eems to
be as requi&s;ite to her exi&s;tence as food; there is not &s;uch an infernal
&s;uccubus in human nature; and may I be damned'&mdash;for our friend Figgins
would &s;ometimes &s;wear&mdash;'if it were my fate to chu&s;e whether to
encounter the anger of a hungry lion, or groan under the influence of a plot
again&s;t me, prepared and inflicted by that &s;he fiend, if I would not
tru&s;t the claws of old Leo rather than the diabolical fangs of Mother
O'Shockne&s;y.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Now you may remember,' continued Figgins, 'I
caught Ma&s;ter John in a lie. It was this:&mdash;Kitty had told me &s;he had
&s;een this gentleman of ours very bu&s;ily employed in a familiar
conver&s;a|tion at Li&s;le with that fellow of your brother's, Flu&s;h, whom,
by the way, I never liked&mdash;indeed I know Mr. Standfa&s;t turned him off on
account of his attachment to Mrs. O'Devil. Why Mrs. Kitty told me this I
remember I thought very odd at the time, but catching from it, at the moment,
an idea concerning the embezzlement of the let|ters, I, with more bluntne&s;s
than wit, taxed the gentleman with his intimate acquaintance with Mr. Flu&s;h,
which he denied, and which Kitty confirmed to his face. It was this determined
me to take your letters my&s;elf, and this has kept me ever &s;ince upon my
guard, as to this fellow; <PB N="213" REF="215"> and finding now which way he
inclines, it is more than po&s;&s;ible he has been a ra&s;cal all along, and
that even the half-guinea he refu&s;ed from Sir Daniel Dogbolt was a feint,
through which he acted according to his in&s;tructions.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles &s;aid he had never correctly under&s;tood that
bu&s;ine&s;s, or what it alluded to; nor had he known more than that &s;ome
difference had happened between his father and mother, which had been happily
adju&s;ted through the mediation of Mr. Standfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Figgins &s;aid when his mind could bear the rela|tion he would
acquaint him with all the particulars, exactly as it had been related by my
lord to the &s;ur|geon, at the John of Gaunt's Head, and who he &s;aid had,
&s;pight of all Standfa&s;t's care, not pre&s;erved the &s;ecret &s;o
&s;acredly as a man of his profe&s;&s;ion ought. This however did not happen to
be the truth, for it was through Mr. Standfa&s;t, and no other per&s;on, that
Mr. Figgins came by his intelligence. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid Figgins, 'to fini&s;h with this
dear harmle&s;s lady, whom I &s;o dearly love, if &s;he has any hand in your
affairs, you may be a&s;&s;ured it will be pro|ductive of mi&s;chief to you
both in England and here.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"> Charles &s;aid he had no doubt of the
gentlewo|man's kind offices, but yet he &s;aw no harm that could come of them,
for his father was pretty well upon his guard again&s;t her; and as to his own
con|duct, it was, he flattered him&s;elf, at lea&s;t in mate|rial points, not
&s;uch as to merit reproach. 
<Q REND="inline">'All I wi&s;h,' &s;aid he, 'is to hear from my
dear father; if he remain &s;afe from the malice of our enemies, I will forgive
every thing they can do to me.'</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ubject however was never out of Figgins's mouth, and
indeed, though nothing could be ma|naged with more cautious delicacy, one would
think he had an inclination to &s;ink his friends &s;pirits till he &s;hould be
inclined to &s;ave the trouble of a public trial, by hanging him&s;elf in his
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>All this however was not &s;ufficient to damp the &s;pirits of
our hero, though I mu&s;t own his &s;ituation &s;eemed a good deal to tire his
patience. He had &s;o invariably adhered to tho&s;e principles which, at his
out&s;et in life, he had &s;o invariably laid down for him&s;elf, that,
con&s;cious of his own innocent in|tentions, he did not believe it po&s;&s;ible
that he could &s;ink under the weight of inju&s;tice. He therefore entreated
his friend&mdash;who, as the trial approached, put on looks more and more
rueful&mdash;to make him|&s;elf ea&s;y. 
<Q REND="inline">'How can I?' &s;aid Figgins. 'All the 
<PB N="215" REF="217"> devils in hell, one would think, con&s;pire again&s;t
you. I declare to God to &s;ee virtue like yours &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed is enough
to make one cur&s;e one's be|ing, and wi&s;h rather to be the vile&s;t reptile
than a human creature.'</Q> And then would he enu|merate the damned things, as
he called them, that had fallen out to thwart the good intentions of our hero;
and the&s;e would he follow up with his ap|prehen&s;ions for his &s;afety; then
cut a little out of the way to take a wipe at that fury in petticoats, Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y; then cur&s;e, then hope, then &s;hudder, then admire again the
fortitude of his friend, and then exclaim that in &s;uch an infernal world as
this, it was not worth while to be virtuous, for that none but ra&s;cals were
happy.</P>
<P>It was about two days before the trial, when he had one morning
wound up, or rather let down, our hero, by &s;imilar remarks to the&s;e, that
he un|dertook to go through the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Snaffle, with all
its con&s;equences, which really &s;hocked Charles to &s;uch a degree that his
&s;pirits were &s;carcely able to bear it. Seeing this, Figgins cur&s;ed
him&s;elf for his incon&s;iderate ra&s;hne&s;s. Said he, 
<Q REND="inline">'My unconquerable friend&s;hip makes me a fool;
and, in proportion as you are oppre&s;&s;ed, you &s;o creep into my heart,
that, out of complai&s;ance to your curio&s;ity, I do the very things which
un|man <PB N="216" REF="218"> you, when&mdash;if like other men I had more art
than hone&s;ty&mdash;I &s;hould try to render you cal|lous to your fate, rather
than melt you into almo&s;t a de&s;ire to meet it. But come Charles,' added he,
embracing him, 'I will &s;tand by you nobly, and if you mu&s;t fall, you
&s;hall not want a friend to revenge you.'</Q></P>
<P>In this delightful mood did this kind friend per|mit Charles to
remain for that day. On the next he entered his friend's apartment with a
mo&s;t cheer|ful countenance, &s;aying there was long-looked-for come at
la&s;t, and with the&s;e words pre&s;ented a packet of letters, which he &s;aid
were ju&s;t arrived by the po&s;t; but that was not all, another parcel had
been left at their bankers, which he &s;uppo&s;ed con|tained the whole of his
father's letters, ever &s;ince he left England.</P>
<P>Charles, who had ha&s;tily catched at the fir&s;t letter that
came to his hand, opened it, and found it from Sir Sidney. He wondered to &s;ee
it begin with Sir, but getting to the &s;econd line, while Figgins was uttering
tho&s;e la&s;t words, which he did not hear, he exclaimed 
<Q REND="inline">'Merciful God!'</Q>&mdash;and fainted away.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ummoned, and he recovered; when, having
raved him&s;elf almo&s;t into another <PB N="217" REF="219"> &s;woon, he became
&s;tupid with horror. At length he grew more calm, and being entreated by his
friend to bear his fortunes like a man, he gathered compo&s;ure enough to read
the following words.

convinced that, &s;hould the event as to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation turn out

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The very number and weight of the&s;e
&s;landers,' &s;aid Charles, 'are what makes me &s;it down per|fectly ea&s;y
under them. I was in a flattering dream as to the world, and fondly fancied
my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of generous friends, who, till I left my native
country, were willing to give me cre|dit for any little merit I
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and anxiou&s;ly &s;tudious to find a venial motive for any
indi&s;cre|tion. But this pre&s;ent moment convinces me I was mi&s;taken; their
di&s;cernment, as to my real character, was &s;o &s;hallow, that it is plain
they laid up every little trait of youthful folly to ground 
<PB N="231" REF="233"> a falacious argument upon, which they now be|lieve to be
&s;olid rea&s;on. This, co-operating with the mo&s;t unworthy and unheard of
treachery, they have given me up as a profligate and an abandoned character,
impo&s;&s;ible to be reclaimed; and this calumny from a quarter they all
dete&s;t&mdash;which common reflection mu&s;t call impo&s;&s;ible and a
lie&mdash;is cheri&s;hed warmly, zealou&s;ly: cheri&s;hed to the utter
reprobation of him for whom they pre|tend a friend&s;hip. To whom then does the
re|probation really belong? Does it not recoil on them&s;elves? And what
compliment &s;hould I pay my&s;elf by calling that man my friend who is &s;o
ready blindly, ignorantly, unfeelingly to think me the wor&s;t villain that
ever infe&s;ted the earth? Perhaps they did not know that I do po&s;&s;e&s;s
one quality in as &s;trong, but I hope as hone&s;t, a degree at lea&s;t as any
of them. If I do not flatter my|&s;elf, my pride is of the right &s;ort; and it
&s;hall not bend to the lea&s;t explanation till I have re|ceived a
conce&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e who have injured me. No, no, Figgins, an emperor
&s;hall not trample upon me; and by all that is &s;acred I will &s;ee
contrition in my enemies before I deign to communicate with them.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My noble friend,' cried Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let me fini&s;h,' &s;aid Charles. 'As to
Annette, &s;he is a <PB N="232" REF="234"> beautiful girl, and I love her
better than any wo|man I ever &s;aw; or rather, what I feel for her is more
like love than I have felt for any other; but I never could flatter my&s;elf we
&s;hould ever be united: there was always a &s;omething about my mind that
forbade me to think of it. As matters are I will forget her; for though I am
convinced this prohibition&mdash;&s;o perver&s;e is human nature&mdash;would
&s;oon, were I to give way to it, make a fool of me, yet it &s;hall not be; for
I will not love her di&s;honourably, and as to marriage, I do not love the
world &s;o well as to bring its cares upon my head.'</Q></P>
<P>Figgins expre&s;&s;ed more amazement at this calm, ea&s;y,

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I know not, in this hurry of my &s;pirits, if there be any
precedents in books of a wo|man's writing to a man out of mere friend&s;hip; at
lea&s;t of &s;ufficient authenticity to warrant my di&s;regarding decorum in
this manner. If there are not, it is a new incident, and I mu&s;t rely on the
purity of my intentions to excu&s;e it.</P>
<P> So extremely like a fairy tale, where the hero's bad genius
only makes its appearance, is all that has happened in this family relative to
you, that if I did not fancy I had my&s;elf &s;agacity enough to account for
the influence of the foul fiend, and whence it originates, I &s;hould think it
very hard indeed that people could not be contented with lo&s;ing their own
&s;en&s;es, but they mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that others lay a&s;ide theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240"> That I may ha&s;ten through this
epi&s;tle &s;ir&mdash;for I have a good deal to &s;ay&mdash;I am willing,
unfa|&s;hionable as it may be at our hou&s;e, to do you poetical ju&s;tice; not
however in the &s;tyle of your good friends here, who, finding you in danger of
your life, think&mdash;in imitation of ARISTOTLE, RICHARDSON, and the barber's
uncle in <HI>Gil Blas&mdash;</HI>that they cannot excite in you too much
ter|ror.</P>
<P> This candour in me does not proceed from any weak
compa&s;&s;ion, but from a fair revi&s;al of your actions at the time they
pa&s;&s;ed under my ob&s;erva|tion: and I do not think that charity
authori&s;es me to look farther, at lea&s;t with a &s;evere eye.</P>
<P> Abiding by this mode of deci&s;ion, common ju&s;tice
obliges me to &s;ay that all your mad freaks here, which I would not have given
a farthing for you if you had been without, originated from wor|thy motives.
Mu&s;quito, Ego, and even Too|good &s;marted, it is true, but they highly
merited their puni&s;hment, and the la&s;h was held by the hand of ju&s;tice;
but think ye they forgot it in your ab&s;ence? Oh no: &s;curvy fellows as they
are. Thank heaven, however, the wor&s;t of your enemies cannot give a bad
motive to your con|duct <PB N="239" REF="241"> in a certain in&s;tance. Yet
there are &s;ome who compare you to Lovelace, and call your treatment of Jude 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;paring your
ro&s;ebud:"</Q>&mdash;charming young man as you were, and I will believe
<HI>are.</HI></P>
<P> Judy daily ble&s;&s;es you, poor girl, and joins with me to
pray for the hard hearts that are &s;et again&s;t you. Your behaviour as to her
began, continued, and ended critically right, and her virtue, as it ought, was
rewarded in the cata&s;trophe; nor can a &s;oul capable of &s;uch an act
indulge a &s;ingle prin|ciple that could dictate &s;uch dreadful crimes as we
are all commanded to believe again&s;t you.</P>
<P> As for my part, I have read &s;o much that hu|man nature is
a thing I am pretty well ver&s;ed in. I mu&s;t beg leave therefore to u&s;e my
own proper intellects, rather than tho&s;e of others; for though I am devoted
to Sir Sidney, yet I am more &s;o to truth and honour: and the&s;e wih not let
me &s;ee why nature &s;hould perform a miracle, by turning all tho&s;e
excellent gifts &s;he had afforded you into diabolical ones, merely for the
gratification of your enemies, and commiting a breach of promi&s;e, which &s;he
was never known in any other in&s;tance to do.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"> Your father was certainly greatly
&s;hocked at not hearing from you; but if we do not admit all the re&s;t, why
&s;hould we not charitably believe your letters have been intercepted. For my
part, I &s;hould think, if you had committed all this wickedne&s;s, you would
the &s;ooner have written to him, if it had been only for the &s;ake of
colour|ing it. But poor man his behaviour was very &s;trange towards the
la&s;t; yet you will find he could not bear to curtail you in your
circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P> As to the &s;tate of our family, it is briefly as follows:
Sir Sidney will not hear a word in your favour from any body; my dear lady you
know is the mirror of duty and goodne&s;s, and therefore if &s;he have any
&s;entiments to your advantage &s;he dare not divulge them even to me; charming
Annette, who&mdash;or our complicated hi&s;tory will be incomplete&mdash;mu&s;t
marry you at la&s;t, is grown an angel, and I &s;cruple not to tell you will
never love any body but your&s;elf: but, dear creature, devoted to her duty,
how will &s;he dare to look a &s;tern father in the face, much le&s;s di&s;obey
him; and, unfortunately, &s;he is not Lady Roebuck's child.</P>
<P> I have not mentioned to you however all our 
<PB N="241" REF="243"> family: Mr. Glo&s;s I can a&s;&s;ure you is no very
in|con&s;iderable member of it. He has &s;o pu&s;hed him&s;elf among the great,
that he is in parliament, and he has &s;o attached him&s;elf to Sir Sidney,
that he is become his darling. He has certainly a knowledge of human nature,
but it is an artful one; for I can &s;ee plainly he has got round the good
gentleman by prai&s;ing his ance&s;try, which we all know is his foible. They
have agreed to|gether on making &s;ome motion relative to the an|tiquities of
Engli&s;h baronets: then he has intro|duced a number of improvements at
Ca&s;tlewick, and put the people in a way of carrying the goods to market upon
much better terms than they were u&s;ed to; which is all very good if his
motives were &s;o: he has al&s;o been indefatigable in &s;e|conding Sir
Sidney's de&s;igns at Little Hockley, but how that will be now I do not know,
for your brother is beginning to &s;ettle grooms and others of his &s;porting
followers there.</P>
<P> Mr. Glo&s;s, finding my partiality to books, thought he
knew where to find me vulnerable; but all his erudition was not able to cover

<Q REND="inline">'This girl,' &s;aid Figgins, 'with her
whim&s;ical &s;tyle, has more good &s;en&s;e than all of them put 
<PB N="243" REF="245"> together. Her reading has been like the pro|gre&s;s of a
bee; &s;he has &s;elected all the &s;weets, and left the poi&s;on behind: and
it proves that her in|tellects are remarkably &s;trong, for &s;he &s;eems to
have gathered as much mundaine knowledge by inference as others from worldly
commerce; and this is well exemplified in her being too cunning for Mr.
Glo&s;s, who indeed &s;eems to be the direc|tor of this plot. I wonder upon
what terms he and the Lady Dowager are.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She is a very good girl,' &s;aid Charles, 'and
I am afraid her &s;olicitude for me will deprive her of her place.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I fear &s;o too,' &s;aid Figgins, 'for &s;he
does not di&s;gui&s;e that &s;he di&s;likes Glo&s;s, who will take ad|vantage
of her being upon a fal&s;e &s;cent to get rid of her; for her &s;u&s;picions
of Mr. Standfa&s;t, not|with&s;tanding his &s;candalous letter, are &s;urely
ill grounded. This will be found out, and &s;he will be turned away as a
mi&s;chief-maker. But for this mi&s;take, the remarks in her letter would have
been very &s;hrewd and &s;en&s;ible; but her di&s;like to Standfa&s;t is of
ancient date. He made pretty bri&s;k love to her when he was in the family of
Major Malplaquet, and, upon her re&s;i&s;ting his <PB N="244" REF="246">
inclinations, he did not place in her virtue that implicit belief that it
merited.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould think that would in&s;pire her
con|tempt,' &s;aid Charles, 'rather than her revenge. However, I cannot help
thinking as you do that Mr. Standfa&s;t has given no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to this
&s;candal but his belief of its truth, which cannot have failed to lend weight
and con&s;equence to the opinions of the re&s;t, both in regard to their
con|viction that he is a judge of mankind, and that he mu&s;t know me better
than any body. It only turns out that he does not know me at all; nay that I
did not know him; for I could not have thought it po&s;&s;ible he could &s;o
&s;oon, nor with &s;o much indifference, have dropt the ma&s;k of the kind
friendly advi&s;er, to betray the in&s;olent a&s;&s;uming pedagogue.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear &s;ir,' &s;aid Figgins, 'you will
plea&s;e to recoliect that Mr. Standfa&s;t gets in years, which will not
le&s;&s;en his pride, of which he has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pretty liberal
quantity all his life, and you may be a&s;&s;ured it is not dimini&s;hed by a
recollection that he has a good five hundred a year &s;ettled on him for life;
which he ought, by the bye, to have the gratitude to remember belongs in right
to you. My two hundred a year comes from the &s;ame <PB N="245" REF="247">

common decency that we &s;hould &s;hew a wi&s;h, even though we have not

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' &s;aid Charles, 'God knows how long I am
to live, but that I may not pa&s;s my life in an eternal warfare, I will not
inve&s;tigate any thing: Time &s;hall do it for me. There is but one
in|ducement to my giving the matter a &s;ingle thought, which is the
&s;ituation of Annette. How|ever, all I can do actively in relation to her will
not only operate more to her di&s;advantage, but plunge me into real
wretchedne&s;s, which is a thing, I thank them all, full unplea&s;ant enough
when one only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it in imagination. When my mind is more at
ea&s;e I may perhaps an&s;wer Emma's letter, but it will be only
&s;trenuou&s;ly to reque&s;t &s;he will not concern her&s;elf in my affairs at
all, and to make the poor creature ea&s;y, by tell|ing her that I can &s;mile

choice; and, if they do not care which, it would &s;urely be greatly beneath me

<P>A &s;ummons to dinner put an end to this long conver&s;ation,
after which Figgins left his friend, in his mi&s;erable apartment, to go and
prepare the aw|ful bu&s;ine&s;s of the next day. He was no &s;ooner gone than
our hero began to pervade the contents of tho&s;e letters which Figgins had
brought him from the bankers. Fir&s;t he &s;elected tho&s;e from his father,
which were filled with &s;uch tenderne&s;s, &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s of heart,
&s;uch &s;en&s;ibility, yet unmixed with a &s;ingle reproach, that all poor
Charles's fortitude was nearly exhau&s;ted. He &s;ighed, wrung his hands, and
cried like a child, which his gaoler&mdash;as he en|tered his apartment to
examine if the rivets of his fetters were fa&s;t&mdash;mi&s;taking for
apprehen&s;ion on ac|count of his approaching trial, begged he would make

his &s;tory. At pre&s;ent we are going into happier company, and if it be

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CLUE TO THE FOREGOING LABYRINTH.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>RETROSPECTION is a very good and a very nece&s;|&s;ary thing. If
one's actions appear worthy upon a review, they will be a &s;ort of &s;ecurity
for the future; if otherwi&s;e, their deformity being an unplea&s;ant object of
contemplation, we may perhaps wi&s;h to replace it with &s;omething of a more
lovely appear|ance: at lea&s;t this will be the ca&s;e with good minds. Some
men love &s;ingularity, others ugline&s;s, and I &s;incerely believe it is in
&s;ome men's nature to love wickedne&s;s, and even wickedne&s;s in which no
plea|&s;ure can be enjoyed but the mere exerci&s;e of it. For my part, however,
I &s;hall not here treat of &s;uch innate, undeducible affections, but
endeavour to give to a po&s;itive cau&s;e every little freak of fancy that the
per&s;onages in this hi&s;tory chu&s;e to occupy their attention with.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary conduct has been lately ob|&s;erved to
govern all the good people on this &s;ide of the water, ever &s;ince the reader
and I took leave of <PB N="249" REF="251"> them, in order to accompany our hero
to France. What appears lea&s;t reconcileable to credibility, is the alteration
of Sir Sidney, who, being a man of rea&s;on, of the world, of experience, of
con&s;ide|ration, and of uncommon benevolence, one would naturally &s;uppo&s;e
mu&s;t, in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner, have been tampered with before he
could have been induced to give up a young man in who&s;e dawnings of maturity
he had taken abundant plea|&s;ure, who&s;e father he had loved and honoured,
and of who&s;e happine&s;s he had hoped to have been the guardian.</P>
<P>Indeed when our hero left England Sir Sidney contemplated with
great plea&s;ure when he &s;hould return, in the bloom of manhood, with all
tho&s;e confirmed accompli&s;hments &s;o con&s;onant to his rank and talents,
the rea&s;onable delight with which he &s;hould witne&s;s an union between him
and his daughter, and as no one &s;poke of Charles but in a &s;tyle of the
mo&s;t exalted panegyric, no wonder if he was charmed at &s;eeing every thing
and every body confirm &s;uch hone&s;t and legitimate &s;enti|ments. But, when
a week, then a fortnight, then a month, then two, then four, elap&s;ed without
a &s;ingle line from Charles to either his father, his mi&s;tre&s;s, or any
other friend, what could Sir Sid|ney <PB N="250" REF="252"> think? What
judgment could he form of tho&s;e reports which continually a&s;&s;ailed his
ears, and which &s;eemed gradually to turn all his friends again&s;t him?</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to watch the progre&s;s of this
bu&s;ine&s;s. Zekiel, as the reader was long ago in|formed, when he left Eaton
went to France. There being in very &s;traitened circum&s;tances, and totally
under the direction of Mr. Flu&s;h, he was obliged to practi&s;e many tricks
and &s;hifts to get on, e&s;pecially as Kiddy, who &s;eems as a
manooverer&mdash;his own word&mdash;to be a twin-born with Standfa&s;t, very
carefully threw certain gentlemen depredators in his way, who are, as every
body knows, pretty plentiful in France, and who took care&mdash;his own
language again&mdash;to keep the pur&s;e, by &s;weating it, in good running
order.</P>
<P>Being very clo&s;ely driven at Calais, and not hav|ing enough of
Kiddy about him to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween what the law calls theft, from that
which is &s;o denominated by rea&s;on, he did that through in|experience for
which he <HI>might</HI> have been hanged, when, in fact, his mode of policy
&s;hould have made him do only that for which he <HI>ought</HI> to have been
hanged.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="253"> Mr. De&s;&s;ein, however, who had his
policy too, as we have &s;een, did not chu&s;e to expo&s;e him, and, by the
advice of his principal, he took care after|wards, however he offended
again&s;t ju&s;tice in a re|ligious &s;en&s;e, not to &s;in again&s;t law.</P>
<P>From a variety of &s;ources which Flu&s;h contrived to get
opened for him, Mr. Zekiel, together with his own income and what he could
drain from his mother, and indeed from Mr. Standfa&s;t, contrived to cut a very
capital da&s;h at Paris. He &s;et very large &s;ums <HI>chez les
compte&s;&s;es,</HI> and he betted larger upon the cour&s;e of Fontainebleau.
In &s;hort, in &s;pight of all he could ama&s;s together, hone&s;tly or
di&s;hone&s;tly, he would have found him&s;elf not only aground, but
&s;urrounded with &s;ome very marked di&s;grace, if he had not met with a
gentleman who was &s;o kind as to admini&s;ter very largely to his wants; and
who, not contented with &s;uch liberal in|&s;tances of kindne&s;s to a perfect
&s;tranger, gave evi|dent tokens of &s;atisfaction when the young lord in
expectation informed him he had a very tender af|fection for his
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>This gentleman, the reader &s;ees, was Mr. Tad|pole. He had, it
&s;eems, in company with the young lady we &s;aw at Li&s;le, who was, to &s;ay
truth, not his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;which circum&s;tance indeed Mr. Fig|gins's 
<PB N="252" REF="254"> &s;agacity taught us to &s;u&s;pect
before&mdash;deter|mined to make one bold pu&s;h to render him&s;elf
in|dependant. He had ama&s;&s;ed at the gaming table in England about nine
hundred pounds, to which his reputed &s;i&s;ter added thirteen hundred, which
&s;he had won at a different game. Their plan was to &s;nap up &s;ome young man
of good expectations, fir&s;t &s;upplying him with money, and afterwards with a
wife.</P>
<P>Tadpole, who was originally a lawyer's clerk, carefully
&s;ecured every &s;tep he took, and, by the time he reached England, had Zekiel
&s;o completely in his power, that, being then of age, he &s;crupled not to
make over to his friend the rever&s;ion of a part of his father's terra
firma.</P>
<P>Coming &s;o unexpectedly to his title and fortune, advantage was
taken of this power over him, and a marriage &s;uddenly clapt up; not out of
fear of any reluctance in the young lord, but le&s;t an old lady, one Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y, &s;hould not only de&s;troy the hopes of the young lady, by the
exerci&s;e of her power over him, but al&s;o tho&s;e of the gentleman, by
fur|ni&s;hing him with the money to pay off the mort|gage.</P>
<P>This marriage, which Emma gave us a hint of, 
<PB N="253" REF="255"> operated as we &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to
no|tice, in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner; but the bu|&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent
being to account for the reports again&s;t our hero, I &s;hall go back to
Li&s;le, where the reader will recollect I entreated his particular at|tention
to all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our hero had never &s;een Flu&s;h, and the two bro|thers were
&s;o grown out of each other's remem|brance, that it is not wonderful they
&s;hould remain in mutual ignorance till an accident unravelled the my&s;tery.
After Zekiel had retired, vowing re|venge, and left his brother ma&s;ter of the
field of battle, Kiddy, as we have &s;een, told him that re|venge was very
ea&s;ily in his power. He then in|formed him of Madame St. Vivier's intention
to complete the happine&s;s of Charles that evening, and &s;hewed him a chamber
which he &s;aid and believed was hers. Zekiel, following the direction of his
tru&s;ty valet, was admitted to Kitty's bed room, and, in the full belief that
he was deceiving his brother, made as happy as he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion here is, how came Flu&s;h, who was ju&s;t
arrived, to know &s;o well all the&s;e private mat|ters? The an&s;wer is, by
Mrs. Kitty, who, toge|ther with her mi&s;tre&s;s, had been as well in&s;tructed
<PB N="254" REF="256"> upon this occa&s;ion by Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, as Mi&s;s
Snaffle had upon a former one.</P>
<P>Flu&s;h, having the honour to know both the ladies, did not
&s;cruple, when the &s;quabble began between our hero and his brother, to
interrogate the waiting maid as to 
<Q REND="inline">'how the cat jumped,'</Q> as he called it, and,
having learnt from her the parti|culars of the a&s;&s;ignation, propo&s;ed to
put Zekiel in the place of Charles, which &s;he promi&s;ed, without intention
to perform; for &s;he knew if it were de|tected all their other de&s;igns on
our hero would be at an end; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;he feared a
di&s;covery from Flu&s;h, for indeed he menaced it, if &s;he refu&s;ed. She
therefore directed him to conduct Zekiel to her bed chamber, where he
pa&s;&s;ed the night, and the per&s;on who tapped at the door was Mr. Tadpole,
who having fir&s;t knocked at his <HI>&s;oidi&s;ante</HI> &s;i&s;ter's, thought
he had mi&s;taken the room, and afterwards went to his own bed, for fear of
fur|ther mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>So completely however were all the&s;e cro&s;s pur|po&s;es
acted, that Kitty believed the per&s;on who knocked at the door to be no other
than Mr. Fig|gins, who, in his turn, as has been &s;hewn, was otherwi&s;e
employed. Kitty, however, having given <PB N="255" REF="257"> Madame St. Vivier
a hint of this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he burnt a light in her chamber, by which means
Charles came, as he informed Figgins, at the certainty of his not being
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t awkward circum&s;tance in this affair was the &s;cene
which pa&s;&s;ed the next day in the po&s;t chai&s;e between Zekiel and his two
companions.&mdash;Tadpole had taxed the young lady in the morning as to what
per&s;on was in her bed chamber; &s;he a&s;|&s;ured him it was the young lord;
they were there|fore a&s;toni&s;hed that he him&s;elf dropt no hint of it,
while, on his &s;ide, he trembled for fear any one &s;hould have maliciou&s;ly
di&s;covered to them what he thought had really happened.</P>
<P>This doubtful taciturnity gave Tadpole a notion that he was
inwardly hugging him&s;elf at his &s;ucce&s;s, and that probably having
&s;tolen the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the young lady, he might, for &s;ome
rea&s;on or other, &s;lacken in his devoirs for the future. Mi&s;s al&s;o had
&s;u&s;picions akin to the&s;e, and &s;he had once an idea of throwing
her&s;elf at her brother's feet, and mak|ing u&s;e of this opportunity, through
his authority, of exacting from Zekiel a written promi&s;e of mar|riage. She
refrained however, and it was well &s;he did. Tadpole ventured a few hints. He
&s;aid he believed the devil had been let loo&s;e the night be|fore 
<PB N="256" REF="258"> in the inn, for he had heard &s;uch running about and
knocking at doors, that he could not get a wink of &s;leep. Zekiel blundered
out an awkward remark or two, Mi&s;s ventured at a few leading que&s;tions,
and, in &s;hort, they were all three on the verge of a di&s;covery, which would
probably have overturned their re&s;pective intentions.</P>
<P>It happened however that but one di&s;covery came of it, and
that was confined to the knowledge of Tadpole and the young lady. It was, that
&s;ome|body had been in bed with Mi&s;s, which &s;omebody was neither Zekiel
nor Tadpole. They therefore, for they had not an idea of Figgins, concluded it
to be Charles, and this thought dwelling in their imagination, pre&s;ented
it&s;elf as a bar to their &s;cheme. Upon a con&s;ultation on this &s;ubject
after|wards, however, they re&s;olved it &s;hould make no difference as to
their future mea&s;ures, and their minds being thus made up&mdash;which the
reader will allow to be a pretty &s;trong in&s;tance of delicacy&mdash;all
matters went in their former channel.</P>
<P>When they came to England it was agreed, on all hands, that Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y and Standfa&s;t &s;hould know no more of Mr. and Mi&s;s Tadpole
than if there had been no &s;uch per&s;ons in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="259"> And now came, as Figgins called it,
ma&s;ter|&s;troke the fir&s;t. This gentleman corre&s;ponded with Mr.
Standfa&s;t, as did al&s;o Madame St. Vivier, who&s;e real name was Jenny
Singleton, with Mrs. O'Shock|ne&s;y. From their accounts they had began to
frame an accu&s;ation, which the arrival of Zekiel greatly improved, and which,
with its amendments, &s;tood as in Standfa&s;t's letter.</P>
<P>The&s;e tidings were conveyed to Mr. Glo&s;s, who in&s;inuated
them into Sir Sidney's family as oppor|tunity &s;erved; and, as fa&s;t as one
rumour died away, he broached another, that the good baronet might not be
&s;uffered to cool.</P>
<P>In this worthy bu&s;ine&s;s he found three very u&s;eful tools
in Mu&s;quito, Ego, and Toogood; who remem|bering, as Emma has told us, their
old grudge&mdash;e&s;|pecially when revived in its wor&s;t lights by
Glo&s;s&mdash;were continually throwing out &s;ome hint to Charles's
di&s;advantage. Mu&s;quito &s;aid the young fellow was mad, and becau&s;e he
had been tolerably educated, and puffed up with fal&s;e applau&s;e, had, like
other &s;poilt children, thought he could carry all the world before him.
Toogood &s;aid that he could not have believed a young man of &s;uch
pro|mi&s;ing parts would &s;o di&s;grace all his friends, while 
<PB N="258" REF="260"> Ego declared that if he had been a young fellow ble&s;t
with &s;o many advantages, he would have turned out the be&s;t creature in the
world. In &s;hort, Glo&s;s made them play fa&s;t and loo&s;e, as he plea&s;ed,
and when they talked in exaggerating terms of his former pranks, he once
ventured in a mild way to reprobate the part Sir Sidney had taken in the
bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Swa&s;h and the taylor, &s;aying he &s;hould not wonder to
hear his acquie&s;cence upon that occa&s;ion quoted as an excu&s;e for the
wretch's enormities.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, together with the interception of Charles's
letters, which, by the bye, furni&s;hed Standfa&s;t, who received them, with a
mo&s;t admi|rable guide to the execution of his &s;chemes, and now and then
&s;ome cur&s;ory intelligence from gen|glemen ju&s;t arrived from France, who
&s;aw our hero drunk at an inn, or quarrelling in a coffee-hou&s;e, where he
refu&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding their earne&s;t &s;olicita|tion, to &s;end any
letter or me&s;&s;age to England. All the&s;e I &s;ay worked his utter ruin in
the opinion of his friends; and yet, I mu&s;t do Sir Sidney the ju&s;|tice to
&s;ay he he&s;itated again&s;t what appeared to be po&s;itive conviction till
one morning news was brought that Lord Hazard was found &s;hot through the
head, and that the act was certainly committed by him&s;elf, for one pi&s;tol
lay clo&s;e by him, and <PB N="259" REF="261"> another was found loaded in his
pocket; and they were the &s;ame pair he had bought when he was la&s;t in
town.</P>
<P>Two days after this melancholy accident John ar|rived, who wept
over his old ma&s;ter's corp&s;e, &s;aid he did not wonder at what had
happened, after|wards corroborated all that had been reported, did not &s;pare
Figgins, and concluded with an account of Charles's being impri&s;oned at Lyons
for murder, producing, at the &s;ame time, a French Gazette, which gave the
particulars of the whole tran&s;action. Under the&s;e appearances, with Glo&s;s
at his elbow, Sir Sidney wrote the letter we have &s;een.</P>

wor&s;t of injuries&mdash;the tak|ing away a man's good name&mdash;I feel it
incumbent on me to account for the clo&s;e intimacy which cer|tainly did
&s;ub&s;i&s;t between them.</P>
<P>When Glo&s;s came to England from Madeira, either accident, or
nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;omething&mdash;for it is not nece&s;&s;ary now to be
particular&mdash;pointed out Mr. Standfa&s;t as a proper per&s;on to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his views of &s;ettling in this country.</P>
<P>That reverend gentleman, ever ready to help out 
<PB N="261" REF="263"> a genius&mdash;for this quality mu&s;t be allowed to Mr.
Glo&s;s&mdash;advi&s;ed him to trump up a &s;tory of going to the Cape of Good
Hope, and then return, after go|ing only to Madeira, where he actually had yet
&s;ome little bu&s;ine&s;s, and circulate a report that he had touched his
father's fortune, which, being in merchandi&s;e, he had only to change it into
money, to cut a figure.</P>
<P>Being introduced to a number of trade&s;men, as a young nabob,
he pre&s;ently &s;at him&s;elf down in a mo&s;t elegant hou&s;e, built a
<HI>vis a vis,</HI> and took up large quantities of goods: Standfa&s;t
&s;upplying him with what ready money he was in ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity
of.</P>
<P>Cutting this figure, and having his preten&s;ions backed by
Standfa&s;t, money was next borrowed, Snaffle and Dogbolt becoming
occa&s;ionally colla|teral &s;ecurities; and this trade went on &s;o
&s;wim|mingly, that in le&s;s than a year and a half they found their names
&s;tanding out on different engagements for upwards of twenty-&s;even
thou&s;and pounds! twelve at lea&s;t of which Standfa&s;t had converted to his
own proper u&s;e: for the avarice of Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y was in&s;atiable, and
the poor gentle|man doated on her to a degree of infatuation.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264"> Thus &s;ituated, their ruin collectively
was inevi|table, if they could not &s;tem this &s;torm, which now &s;eemed to
be bur&s;ting over their heads. The diffi|culty &s;eemed to be how to manage
it, but to &s;uch geniu&s;es all dangers were &s;urmountable. Some hundreds
were laid out in India goods, to &s;hew by way of &s;ample, which were bought
for exportation, to &s;ave the drawback, and afterwards clande&s;tinely
relanded.</P>
<P>Every po&s;&s;ible exertion was made to give re&s;pon|&s;ibility
and con&s;equence to the appearance of Mr. Glo&s;s. A large e&s;tate was
bargained for; nay he even went &s;o far as to wait on the mini&s;ter, to offer
an exclu&s;ive treaty for a loan. Thus his name rang in the new&s;papers, and
the whole world, believing him to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an immen&s;e
for|tune, offered him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might think proper to command.
Large &s;ums were &s;oon pre&s;&s;ed upon him, which went to &s;atisfy &s;uch
as would not &s;hift the re&s;pon&s;ibility from his confederates &s;houl|ders
to his. Others did not make any difficulty of doing this; &s;o that after a
variety of negociations, Mr. Glo&s;s's name &s;tood alone for the original
&s;um of twenty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds, and &s;even added to it!</P>
<P>What was the next &s;tep? How was he to go on 
<PB N="263" REF="265"> How &s;kreen him&s;elf from his creditors? How in|deed,
but by borrowing the writings of a friend's e&s;tate, and &s;tanding for a
borough! He had given proofs of his abilities as a negociator; nobody knew the
theory of commerce better; who then &s;o proper to fill an office under the
&s;tate?</P>
<P>He had fixed his eye on the trea&s;ury &s;hip of the navy, and I
have &s;aid he had a knock of getting to any &s;pot that he fixed his attention
on. A public acknowledgment that he was determined upon hav|ing this po&s;t,
that is to &s;ay, whenever there &s;hould be a mini&s;try virtuous enough for
him to mix with, gained him his election.</P>
<P>His &s;peech from the hu&s;tings was very original, and
therefore very taking. In all addre&s;&s;es he had hitherto noticed, there were
a number of general promi&s;es, which were never performed. He, on the
contrary, re&s;olved to promi&s;e nothing but what his con&s;tituents were
&s;ure he would perform if he could.</P>
<P>He began with &s;aying that he had an intere&s;t in offering
him&s;elf for that borough, and &s;o had every man living when he made a
&s;imilar application; for would any one pre&s;ent, or in the world, exerci&s;e
<PB N="264" REF="266"> his talents for nothing? This, he &s;aid, was ho|ne&s;t,
and, therefore, he had no doubt it would be popular. He went on with &s;aying
he had watched with great attention the unhappy &s;ituation of this country,
and was ready to lend a helping hand to &s;ave it from impending ruin. For this
however he certainly expected a reward: and it was but ju&s;t. Would a
phy&s;ician &s;ave a life without a fee?&mdash;or a par&s;on a &s;oul without
his tithes? It was folly, it was non&s;en&s;e, it was hypocri&s;y, for men to
pre|tend di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and mere love of their coun|try. He loved his
country as well as any body; was as di&s;intere&s;ted as any body; but &s;till,
patrio|ti&s;m and &s;elf-denial could not imply, in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance,
more than this: that while loaves and fi&s;hes are going forward, a man
&s;hould eat only to &s;atisfy nature, in&s;tead of guttling till he fur|feited
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he would be plain, and fairly lay open all his views.
The navy of this nation was its bul|wark, its glory. It was that which lent
millions to our trea&s;ury, magnificence to our appearance, and terror to our
name. It was that which made us re|&s;pected and admired; dreaded and envied.
We made but a point on the face of the globe, but yet that point, though
&s;mall, was re&s;plendant. It was <PB N="265" REF="267"> gazed at with wonder
by the remote&s;t corners of the earth. We were the true Cyno&s;ure of trade;
the commercial pole, that, with more than mag|netic force, attracted the
intere&s;ts of &s;urrounding nations. All this was owing to our navy: the
pro|tection of our commerce. His ambition therefore was to be trea&s;urer of
that navy; in the execution of which office, though he expected to be paid for
his trouble, yet he would be bold to &s;ay his conduct would de&s;erve it: for
he was &s;ure he &s;hould &s;ave immen&s;e &s;ums to the nation!</P>
<P>He &s;aid he de&s;pi&s;ed profe&s;&s;ions. They were un|manly,
ungenerous, and an in&s;ult to tho&s;e to whom they were made: he had therefore
hone&s;tly opened his mind. That hone&s;ty would, he doubted not, be a
&s;ufficient &s;ecurity with Engli&s;hmen, who&s;e na|tural character was
hone&s;ty, for his future good intentions. If he &s;hould have the great honour
to be returned for the borough of Bray, and a mini&s;ter &s;hould come in of
&s;ufficient ability and integrity for him to act with, he would &s;tipulate
for the &s;itua|tion he had &s;et his heart upon, and they would then &s;ee how
the money would be handled! He would be bold to &s;ay, though it would be for
his intere&s;t, it &s;hould al&s;o be for theirs: for the intere&s;ts of the
member and his con&s;tituents were in&s;eperable.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268"> He fini&s;hed his &s;peech with &s;aying
he &s;corned to appeal to their ears, he hoped he had appealed to their hearts;
and as their own conviction mu&s;t teach them that truth, and only truth, had
been his guide, he hoped that hone&s;ty, plain dealing, and unre&s;erved candor
would mark that day as an epoch when a member of parliament was cho&s;en who
had no expectations but from honour, no views but from &s;entiment.</P>
<P>I need not add that Mr. Glo&s;s carried his elec|tion; for
notwith&s;tanding this florid &s;peech, which was indeed novel enough, he had
bought the bo|rough, and the gentleman who conte&s;ted the elec|tion was only a
nominal antagoni&s;t, &s;et up to &s;ave appearances.</P>
<P>This point being carried, the per&s;on of Mr. Glo&s;s was
&s;acred, and his creditors might go whoop for their money. Exa&s;perated with
this treatment, his <HI>vis a vis</HI> was &s;topt in the &s;treet, and
executions &s;erved in his hou&s;e. But this was as u&s;ele&s;s as the re&s;t;
all his property was made over to Mr. Stand|fa&s;t, for money lent. And now we
&s;ee Mr. Glo&s;s without an inch of land he could call his own, nearly forty
thou&s;and pounds in debt, with a hou&s;e and an equipage made over for
&s;afety to another, a parlia|ment <PB N="267" REF="269"> man, a popular
&s;peaker, almo&s;t the leader of a party, and making large &s;trides, with the
princi|ples we have &s;een, towards a re&s;pon&s;ible and lucra|tive place
under government: for the trea&s;urer&s;hip of the navy he was determined to
have.</P>
<P>As he really began to boa&s;t, and not without rea&s;on, of his
influence, he thought he could not attack Sir Sidney in a more vulnerable place
than his ancient hou&s;e, which, from a long train of col|lateral argument, he
proved to be older than the baronet him&s;elf had &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not go into the minutiae of this arrange|ment, which
mu&s;t not only be dry, but unintere&s;t|ing to the reader, who, I dare &s;ay,
would bate a little in the article of birth to &s;uch as made up the deficiency
in honour&mdash;but only &s;ay that Mr. Glo&s;s made it out very clearly that
Sir Sidney was the only living i&s;&s;ue of the family who held the honour of
the fir&s;t Engli&s;h baronetcy, and offered to make a motion in the hou&s;e,
which he &s;hould &s;upport with many powerful arguments, that his maje&s;ty be
advi&s;ed to grant to Sir Sidney Walter Roebuck, and his heirs for ever, an
exclu&s;ive patent of baronetcy, under the title of baronet in chief, to be
con&s;idered as an honour between that of a common baronet and a baron, in like
manner as a marquis is con&s;idered be|tween <PB N="268" REF="270"> an earl and
a duke, and the precedent to be quoted, as an illu&s;tration of the argument,
was to be, that as there was but one real marquis&mdash;which was the ca&s;e at
that time&mdash;&s;o there &s;hould be but one chief baronet.</P>
<P>The baronet certainly li&s;tened to the propo&s;al, and turned
it a good deal in his mind, and though he doubted whether he &s;hould avail
him&s;elf of &s;uch an opportunity of aggrandizing his
family&mdash;e&s;peci|ally as he had no &s;on&mdash;yet, as he could &s;ee
nothing but attention to his intere&s;t in the conduct of Glo&s;s, he certainly
conceived from that moment a great re|gard for him. This was prodigiou&s;ly
augmented by the attention this la&s;t mentioned gentleman paid to
Ca&s;tlewick, and the actual advantage its intere&s;ts received from his
advice, which both gave the baronet an in&s;ight into his capacity, and
confirmed his good opinion of it. All the&s;e circum&s;tances co-operating, as
indeed Emma has already told us, no wonder if he had familiar entrance to his
hou&s;e, afterwards to his heart, and at length an offer of his alliance.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s took care al&s;o to appear the friend of Charles;
but then his mediation never came with|out an in&s;inuation that he was more a
friend to ho|nour. In &s;hort the two characters were &s;o &s;trik|ingly
contra&s;ted in the mind of the baronet, that <PB N="269" REF="271"> without
any great &s;tretch of propriety, the reader mu&s;t allow, under the&s;e
circum&s;tances, that it is not to be wondered he &s;hould turn about in the
manner I have de&s;cribed. Be&s;ides&mdash;for I would fain &s;um up every
trifling figure, to make the ag|gregate of my rea&s;ons upon &s;o important a
point convincing&mdash;Sir Sidney felt a delicate, a nice re|pugnance, perhaps
too much &s;o, at the idea of a connection with the &s;on of a man who had
de&s;troyed him&s;elf, and who had, a&s;&s;uredly, borne in his youth a very
bad character.</P>
<P>Again, he plainly fore&s;aw that all his benevolent attempts at
Little Hockley would &s;oon be fru&s;|trated by the innovations of the young
lord; for it was not yet &s;o firmly rooted but that, owing to a new crew of
revellers, it began already to lo&s;e ground. This, and the recollection of the
ancient feuds, which he now feared would be renewed, heartily conquered his
inclination to be in any re|&s;pect allied to the family of Lord Hazard, though
he admired the talents of our hero, and really had &s;uch a value for him as to
wi&s;h his welfare, though he doubted whether he would ever de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t and Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y mu&s;t now become a
little the &s;ubject of our attention. That gentleman and lady had been
&s;ometime married: <PB N="270" REF="272"> but it was the wi&s;h of both that
it &s;hould not be pub|li&s;hed. She brought with her a comfortable number of
debts, and being now a <HI>femme couverte,</HI> very &s;oon contracted a number
more. In &s;hort, there were no bounds to her extravagance, which Mr.
Stand|&s;a&s;t &s;eemed as anxious to feed as &s;he to indulge.&mdash;His own
income, including a living the gift of my lord, his annuity from that nobleman,
the intere&s;t of his legacy from Major Malplaquet, and what he had be&s;ides
been able to realize&mdash;for no object upon earth, except Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y,
had been &s;ixpence expence to him&mdash;was about &s;eventeen hundred a year;
the lady had three; yet we have lately &s;een above twelve thou&s;and added to
their income in a year and a half! But what was this? He doated on her as
implicitly, as rapturou&s;ly, and as boyi&s;hly as Barn well did on Millwood,
and threw large &s;ums into her lap as willingly, whenever he could &s;teal
them: for I think the means he u&s;ed to get at them might very well be called
theft. On her &s;ide, no dutche&s;s mu&s;t dare to vie with her in ta&s;te and
ex|pence. But every &s;ource from whence this profu|&s;ion was &s;upplied at
length dried up. Mr. Glo&s;s being in parliament, nobody would tru&s;t him; and
thus the whole credit of the confederacy was at a &s;tand. Be&s;ides, Lord
Hazard, who was expected to grieve him&s;elf to death for the lo&s;s of his
wife and the irregularities of his &s;on, was yet alive, and 
<PB N="271" REF="273"> had no di&s;order but &s;orrow, which, though
immode|rate, did not &s;eem likely to kill him. What joy then to the heart of
this lady to hear he was no more!&mdash;to find her &s;on in full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more than thirteen thou&s;and a year, the whole of which
&s;he intended to command! Her tran&s;port knew no bounds! She be&s;poke a new
carriage and new liveries, and bowled down into Warwick&s;hire in the mo&s;t
&s;uperb and magnificent &s;tyle that money could procure or fa&s;hion invent:
taking with her &s;uch dome&s;tics for her &s;on as &s;he conceived proper for
his &s;ituation in life. In &s;hort nothing could equal the triumph with which
&s;he thought her&s;elf &s;ure of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both her &s;on's
&s;en&s;es and his affairs. Judge then what was her a&s;toni&s;hment when
flying to his arms he &s;topt her by introducing his wife, being no other than
the very Mi&s;s Tad|pole that Figgins, to u&s;e his own words, dubbed him with
by anticipation at Li&s;le! What then did &s;he feel! Words are not &s;trong
enough to de&s;cribe her &s;en&s;ations. It took her breath away. She raved,
&s;tampt, laughed, execrated, and would probably have died with the violence of
her pa&s;&s;ion, had not a &s;hower of tears borne away the fir&s;t torrent of
that complication of di&s;tre&s;sful feelings which a&s;&s;ailed her. At length
&s;he accompli&s;hed &s;omething like ar|ticulate utterance, when the whole
&s;chool of Billing&s;|gate, had it been pre&s;ent, might have heard and 
<PB N="272" REF="274"> edified. No opprobrious name that could be
&s;can|dalou&s;ly &s;poken or maliciou&s;ly applied, was unre|membered. His
lord&s;hip&mdash;&s;urely no lord was ever &s;o called before&mdash;was a
pitiful ra&s;cal, a nincompoop, a hop o' my thumb, a paltry puppy, and a
pimp|ing &s;coundrel. The lady was a &s;curvy jade, a for|tune hunting minx, a
low wretch, and a &s;orry trull.</P>
<P> Zekiel laughed at all the abu&s;e on him&s;elf, but taking fire
at the in&s;ults offered to his wife, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'I'll tell you what it is ma'am; I know you
&s;ee what you'd be at, but dam'me let me tell you dam'me that I am out of my
leading &s;trings, dam'me if I 'ent, and I won't no longer be &s;chooled, d'ye
&s;ee, by any old cat in England.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Old cat!' &s;creamed out the lady
dowager.</Q></P>
<P>The young lady here interfered, and begged her hu&s;band to
con&s;ider he was talking to his mother.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'To my mother,' cried he, 'why &s;o I know I am,
and a pretty mother &s;he is, now is not &s;he, to a|bu&s;e you and I in this
here manner? Why I know'd what &s;he was upon; &s;he thought to come here and
be lady paramount of every thing, and &s;nub and ding me about like a lout and
a &s;chool boy; but dam'me if I'll have any &s;uch doings: no, I won't old
gentlewoman, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. I know in a week, if &s;he was to be here,
&s;he'd be <PB N="273" REF="275"> whole and fole; nay I &s;hould not wonder if
&s;he wanted at la&s;t to take my &s;eat from me in the hou&s;e of lords. But
hold, now I think on't &s;he has been there once too often already.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You brute!' exclaimed his mother. 'You
wretch!&mdash;you undutiful cur&s;ed devil! Oh I could tear your eyes
out!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare &s;ay you could,' cried the young lord,
'but I'll tell you what mother, if I am &s;o unduti|ful, you had better go away
from &s;uch a cur&s;ed devil, for to tell you the truth I never intended you
&s;hould live with my wife, &s;eeing as how it was not unlikely you would
advi&s;e her to play me a trick or &s;o with my <HI>valet de
chambre.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y could contain her&s;elf no lon|ger: &s;he ran
to his &s;word, and drawing it half way out of the &s;cabbard, &s;wore &s;he
would murder him. Lady Hazard here &s;creamed &s;o loud that Tadpole, who had
been walking in the garden, came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and demanded what
was the matter.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The matter?' cried Zekiel; 'only my old mother
wants &s;o &s;end me po&s;t to the other world, <PB N="274" REF="276">
becau&s;e I reminded her a little of the follies of her youth. God ble&s;s the
good gentlewoman,' add|ed he, 'do now pray go home, wa&s;h the paint off your
&s;aded jaws, and chuckle to old Standfa&s;t.&mdash;Why do you think I have not
been up to all the rum gig? Why yes I have; but it was no bu&s;i|ne&s;s of
mine, you know, while I could coax you out of the ready. Now, d'ye &s;ee, I can
&s;upply my&s;elf, and thanks to nobody:&mdash;&s;o every one for him&s;elf,
and God for us all. Mr. Standfa&s;t has two or three goodi&s;h things: they may
keep you &s;nug enough, if you have a mind to live pretty and decent, as an old
gentlewoman ought. As for me I intend to live nobly, and &s;pend my money like
a man!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;till my lord,' &s;aid Tadpole&mdash;</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'Brother Tadpole,' interrupted Zekiel, 'I'll be
damned if I live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with a wife and a mo|ther, and there's
it d'ye &s;ee. That being the maxim of the thing, you had better, old lady, as
I &s;aid before, go back again; and it may be as well for you to keep a quiet
tongue, and advi&s;e Ma&s;ter Standfa&s;t to do the &s;ame, or it may be the
wor&s;e for both you, d'ye &s;ee, and the rum duke too.</Q></P>
<P>I have neither time nor inclination, nor indeed 
<PB N="275" REF="277"> capacity to paint the fury of the lady, at her leaving
the hou&s;e, which &s;he did &s;oon after. Every bitter wi&s;h her invention
could &s;upply was lavi&s;hed on her &s;on. Among the re&s;t, I think &s;he
&s;aid &s;he hoped to her &s;oul he would be both a beggar and a cuck|old.</P>
<P>The lady's return to Mr. Standfa&s;t, who was pre|vented by
bu&s;ine&s;s from accompanying her into the country, was truly a curious one.
She blamed him for every thing, which was her u&s;ual method when|ever any
thing mi&s;carried; and he, as u&s;ual, bore his jobation with a&s;toni&s;hing
coolne&s;s. This pro|voked her: her pa&s;&s;ion then provoked him: one epithet
begat another, till he was all the old, &s;ap|le&s;s, doting idiots that her
fertile fancy could in|vent; and &s;he was, by his account, the damnede&s;t
infernal hell-cat that ever was born to cur&s;e an un|happy ra&s;cal like
him.</P>
<P>From &s;torming they went to upbraiding then they proceeded to
the &s;ituation of their affairs, which were found to be plunged over head and
ears in difficul|ties. This, in &s;pight of them, brought on re|flexion, and
that upbraided them with the infamous practices they had been guilty of to

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader will judge right if he fancies this re|ception of
Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y was a concerted thing between my lord and his brother in
law, who was now his &s;teward, as was Flu&s;h his butler. Indeed, as every
&s;ervant formerly in the hou&s;e was by this time replaced by others, brought
in at the in&s;tance of the&s;e two friends, his lord&s;hip was doomed to be as
much in leading &s;trings as ever his mother could have held him for the life
of her; but as he was &s;uffered in every thing to have his own way, he did not
concern him&s;elf with what they did privately, but let them feather their
ne&s;ts in quiet, under the idea of taking all his affairs off his hands,
becau&s;e he was a man of rank, in whom it was vulgar to let bu&s;ine&s;s
interfere with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Kiddy under&s;tood one another very well,
for the latter had, while they were in France, made a di&s;covery, of which the
reader &s;hall &s;ome time hence participate.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280"> A &s;ecret to a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, or

then Flu&s;h &s;et up his re&s;t. It is true he ba|lanced, when he fir&s;t came
to England, and was within a hair's breadth of de&s;troying all Tadpole's
hopes, by making the above di&s;covery to his old ma&s;ter Standfa&s;t; but
that gentleman making him &s;ome propo&s;al or other that he did not like, he
re|tracted before he had &s;o explained him&s;elf as to betray Tadpole, and
matters having &s;ince turned out &s;o much to his advantage, he thanked his

<P>Whether Kiddy was tired of his youthful follies, or whether his
whirligig inclinations had wearied them&s;elves with turning round, I know not,
but he &s;eemed like a worn-out weathercock to be glad to ru&s;t where he had
&s;topt: and this choice was ma|nife&s;t in a total alteration in his manners.
He went to church, nay more, he was very often clo&s;eted with a methodi&s;t
preacher, with whom he got drunk, and &s;ang p&s;alms.</P>
<P> The young lord u&s;ed to &s;moke this, as he called it, and
gave him many a dry rub, to one of which &s;allies he one day replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Lord love your <PB N="279" REF="281">
lord&s;hip, my lord, when you come to repent, as I do, of all your worldly gig,
and are down upon the heavenly comfort of a religious life, you may tell the
old rum codger with his hour gla&s;s, come when he will, you are up to all he
knows, and in|different, as &s;ome old learned gentleman &s;ays, whether you
clo&s;e your peepers in &s;leep or in death.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma, who, as &s;he informed our hero, was up on the watch, no
&s;ooner heard of Kiddy's conver|&s;ion, but knowing he mu&s;t be full of good
intelli|gence for her, determined to tamper with him: not that &s;he had any
expectation of finding him le&s;s a hypocrite in his new calling than in his
old one. She therefore &s;aw there might be danger in putting her de&s;igns in
execution per&s;onally. In fact Emma &s;aw her&s;elf of con&s;equence in the
very way &s;he had all her life wi&s;hed to be; for &s;he was convinced &s;he
&s;hould have it in her power, in the language of tho&s;e romances &s;he &s;o
dearly loved, to conduct two con|&s;tant lovers to the temple of Felicity,
through all the briars and bogs that impeded their pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;Flu&s;h
&s;he pitched upon as the vehicle in this trou|ble&s;ome journey, which Swa&s;h
and his daughter were to guide, while &s;he her&s;elf, like &s;ome tutelary
genius, &s;hould watch their motions, in&s;pire them <PB N="280" REF="282">
with courage on the road, and remove all difficulties in their pa&s;&s;age to
this de&s;irable goal.</P>
<P>In le&s;s figurative language, &s;he &s;et Swa&s;h, who with
good rea&s;on loved Charles mo&s;t &s;incerely, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into
Flu&s;h's good graces, who, I can tell you, had already began to love homage,
&s;o little had the &s;pirit mended his humility.</P>
<P>It was in the miller's in&s;tructions never to mention a word of
our hero, or, if he found that unavoida|ble, to cover any &s;u&s;picion of his
friend&s;hip, by railing again&s;t him, but at the &s;ame time to cheri&s;h all
that dropt from Flu&s;h&mdash;who now, for di&s;tinc|tion, began to be called
Canting Kiddy&mdash;that could in the remote&s;t degree lead to any
circum&s;tance that implied a plot having been formed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>As to Jude, her part was a capital one, and had &s;he not been
perfected in it by a very capable in|&s;tructre&s;s, &s;he might have &s;poilt
all.</P>
<P>Kiddy, it was notorious, loved a pretty girl; Judy was
in&s;tructed to throw her&s;elf in his way, to give an account of his
behaviour, and proceed &s;tep by &s;tep as &s;he &s;hould be directed by Emma.
It was fore&s;een her virtue would be attacked, but this was 
<PB N="281" REF="283"> the very cunning of the &s;cene. Whenever this &s;hould
happen to be the ca&s;e, &s;he was directed to draw, in her &s;imple way, a
pathetic picture of the wickedne&s;s of mankind, and lament the blindne&s;s of
the world, who could load the pre&s;erver of her innocence with unmerited
reproaches, while he who was &s;eeking to de&s;troy it had the character of
&s;anc|tity and penitence. They were not &s;o mad how|ever as to tru&s;t to
Judy's prudence alone, nor her rhetoric, for force might overcome both: Swa&s;h
therefore was to be at hand upon any trying occa|&s;ion, to re&s;cue her, which
being romantic, was &s;till more to Emma's ta&s;te.</P>
<P>If &s;he &s;hould get at any material evidence, her next &s;tep
was to &s;trengthen her own weak force by the alliance, as &s;he &s;hould think
fit, of either Mr: Friend or Mr. Balance, or both; and as &s;he &s;aw many
ob&s;tacles would lie in the way, particularly the bu&s;ine&s;s of Glo&s;s,
&s;he advi&s;ed Annette to avow implicitly her affection for Charles, which her
fa|ther had formerly authori&s;ed, and who would not &s;o far contradict his
own excellent character as to in|&s;i&s;t on her marrying one man before &s;he
had forgot|ten the other. Be&s;ides Mr. Glo&s;s was not yet trea|&s;urer of the
navy, and therefore could not make tho&s;e offers as to fortune which a man of
Sir Sid|ney's <PB N="282" REF="284"> rank and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would of
cour&s;e expect, e&s;pecially when he became chief baronet; which
circum&s;tance, ridiculous as it was, really at times occupied his reflections:
for what man is there, let him be ever &s;o good or ever &s;o wi&s;e, but has
his weak &s;ide.</P>
<P>All this jumble or chaos of circum&s;tances were fluctuating at
this time in Emma's head, out of which &s;he had no doubt but &s;he &s;hould
form a world of happine&s;s for the young couple.</P>
<P>Matters being in this &s;tate as to our hero in En|gland, the
reader and I will once more take a trip to the continent, in which journey we
cannot do better than follow the &s;teps of Madame St. Vivier and her handmaid
Kitty, who&s;e private motives being made clearer&mdash;which &s;eems very
nece&s;|&s;ary&mdash;this hi&s;tory will &s;tand as di&s;entangled as any one
could rea&s;onably de&s;ire who wi&s;hes things to be brought forward in their
natural order.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een that I am not very fond of dwelling upon
trifling circum&s;tances, I &s;hall there|fore, without mentioning a word of
the&s;e ladies bringing up, &s;ay that Madame St. Vivier was a fa&s;hionable
woman of the town, and that Mi&s;s Kitty, <PB N="283" REF="285"> though her
handmaid, had been in no le&s;s a &s;phere of life than her&s;elf. Indeed, but
a very few years before, &s;he had cut a figure little le&s;s brilliant than
Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, but falling in love with either the beauty or the brogue of
Mr. Ireland, &s;he had really attached her&s;elf to him with a &s;ingu|lar
degree of con&s;tancy for a lady of her pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When this gentleman was obliged to ab&s;cond, in con&s;equence
of his duel, he left his affairs in the hands of an intimate friend, who
thought proper to take no other notice of the tru&s;t, than by appro|priating
every thing to his own u&s;e, without remitt|ing his friend abroad, or allowing
the lady at home, a &s;ingle &s;ixpence: &s;o that in this ca&s;e Kiddy's
re|mark of honour among thieves did not apply.</P>
<P>Mrs. Kitty having been &s;ometime out of the way of
practice&mdash;for fa&s;hion has as much to do in the&s;e ca&s;es as
beauty&mdash;had recour&s;e to her old friend Jenny Singleton, who began ju&s;t
then al&s;o to be on the decline, and propo&s;ed a vi&s;it to Sedan, where Mr.
Ireland then was, with a view to con&s;ult him on their future operations.</P>
<P>This expedition was lucky enough, for Mr. Glo&s;&s; 
<PB N="284" REF="286"> coming acro&s;s them, they were tutored by Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y how to make their journey worth while.</P>
<P>Figgins gave them intelligence concerning the departure of
Charles; and, as it had been concerted, they met him at Dover.</P>
<P>The ladies however, determined to make all &s;ure, had privately
agreed to act in the very manner Figgins has de&s;cribed; for their experience
gave them rea&s;on to believe that it was not impo&s;&s;ible but Mr. Ireland
might forget to give them the meeting. They therefore were in appearance to be
alternately mi&s;tre&s;s and maid, both to &s;ave ex|pence, to keep their
&s;ecrets to them&s;elves, and al&s;o to avail them&s;elves of any opportunity
that might happen of &s;napping up any Engli&s;h booby, by way of completing
his tour for improvement.</P>
<P>Matters turned out however very much to their &s;atisfaction.
They met with Mr. Ireland at Se|dan; he attended them to Nancy, where, as it
has been &s;een, he plundered our hero of a tolerable &s;upply. Nor did he
ab&s;olutely part with them, but hovered about as it were, till his affairs
called him into Italy, to which place&mdash;after robbing our hero 
<PB N="285" REF="287"> of every thing they could lay their hands on, as we
heard Figgins inform him&mdash;the&s;e two kind ladies followed him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A JESUITICAL EXPLANATION&mdash;THE SEPARATION OF TWO
FRIENDS&mdash;AND AN ANSWER TO EMMA'S LETTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the reader and I were unfeeling enough to leave Charles in
&s;uch a &s;ituation that death &s;eemed almo&s;t de&s;irable to him, Mr.
Figgins appears to have been more &s;olicitous about him, for in le&s;s than
half an hour after the melancholy moment wherein I de&s;cribe him reading his
father's letters, he re|turned with great plea&s;ure in his countenance, took
his friend by the hand, and giving him joy, told him he was liberated!</P>
<P>Charles, going from one extreme to the other, was enraptured at
the news, and reque&s;ted to be in|formed how &s;o unexpected an event had been
brought about. Figgins an&s;wered him that they were in no place to &s;atisfy
his curio&s;ity. They were then joined by their attorney, who had &s;tayed
be|hind to pay the fees of the pri&s;on; and now the jailor, who a little
before had earne&s;tly examined <PB N="287" REF="289"> our hero's chains, to
&s;ee if they were fa&s;t enough, came with great ceremony to unfa&s;ten
them.</P>
<P>This and all other punctilios over, they &s;allied forth, and
Charles and Figgins being arrived at their inn, the latter thus accounted for
his friend's enlargement.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins &s;aid that no &s;ingle day had pa&s;t &s;ince his
friend's impri&s;onment but &s;ome &s;tep had been taken to get at the truth of
the unhappy bu&s;ine&s;s, which had been the means of his &s;uffering in &s;o
worthy a cau&s;e. The accounts had been for a good while various and
un&s;atisfactory, and therefore he determined, as he had enough in all
con&s;cience to vex him without being eternally tortured with &s;uch
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, not to &s;ay a word till &s;ome certain intel|ligence &s;hould
arrive. He &s;aid the fir&s;t clue he had of any thing like a chance of
&s;ucce&s;s, though he took no notice of it at the time, was his friend's
&s;aying he was &s;ure he had &s;omewhere &s;een the murderer. This put it into
his head&mdash;though he owned it was a conjecture greatly at random. 
<Q REND="inline">'But.' added he 'I would catch as much at a
&s;traw for my friend's &s;afety as my own. That Ireland, who was a great
duelli&s;t, was probably the man.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And by heaven,' &s;aid Charles, 'I do believe 
<PB N="288" REF="290"> he was; though it never &s;truck me &s;o till this
moment.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You &s;hall hear,' &s;aid Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was inclined the more to believe this on
hearing his name men|tioned in an odd way by Madame St. Vivier, with whom I now
began to think he had maintained &s;ome intelligence all along; for I
recollected that it dropt from her at Nancy that &s;he had &s;een him in
England. This &s;et me upon interrogating Kitty, who confe&s;&s;ed his having
been at Lyons, and that very probably he was the guilty per|&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was now convinced they knew it. Thinking
therefore to practi&s;e the trick your brother taught us at Li&s;le, I ordered
John to enquire every day at the po&s;t-office, and to bring me any letters
di|rected to Madame St. Vivier. He, I &s;uppo&s;e, made them acquainted with
the&s;e in&s;tructions, for after waiting till about three weeks ago, to no
purpo&s;e, I was ju&s;t thinking what other method I could hit upon, when, all
on a &s;udden, the la|dies and Mr. John decamped, as I imagined, to|gether, but
we have &s;ince learnt he went to En|gland.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Women cannot &s;o ea&s;ily travel &s;ecretly in
France <PB N="289" REF="291"> as men. I therefore &s;oon found out their route,
which, as I &s;u&s;pected, led to where Mr. Ireland was waiting for them. My
fir&s;t intention was to have pur&s;ued them my&s;elf, but reflecting I
&s;hould be of more u&s;e to you upon the &s;pot, I got, by the interference of
our banker, a very intelligent young man to go in my &s;tead.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The in&s;tructions given to this young man were
not to act &s;o as to endanger Mr. Ireland&mdash;for that I knew you did not
wi&s;h&mdash;but only to get from him &s;uch &s;ort of &s;atisfaction as
&s;hould acquit you.&mdash;The fir&s;t part of this injunction was
unnece&s;&s;ary, for though he overtook the ladies in the kingdom of France,
the gentleman was &s;afe in the confines of Savoy. They however, fearing for
them&s;elves, &s;erved him as a guide, and coming at length to where Mr.
Ireland had appointed them, he did you ample ju&s;tice, making voluntary oath
that you had no part in the fray, but that of a mediator, and that &s;o far
from having any malice, you could not po&s;&s;ibly know either the quarrel or
its cau&s;e; for that all you did was merely the effect of acci|dent, and
entirely with a view to prevent mi&s;|chief.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This confe&s;&s;ion, &s;o &s;worn&mdash;which
is now lodged <PB N="290" REF="292"> to ground your di&s;charge upon&mdash;he
accompanied with this letter, which you will find attributes the duel to the
ha&s;tine&s;s of the gentleman who unfor|tunately fell. He talks of
unhand&s;ome reflections again&s;t Engli&s;hmen in general, and him in
parti|cular. In &s;hort, be the cau&s;e of quarrel what it may, he had it in
his power to palliate the matter as he thought proper, for there are no
witne&s;&s;es to contradict him.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus,' added he, 'my noble friend, you are at
liberty, and I offer my&s;elf to avenge you on your enemies in any way you may
think proper to point out for me.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles thanked him heartily, but &s;aid his only revenge would
be contemptuous indifference.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of this account Mr. Figgins ex|ceeded the truth,
and in others fell &s;hort of it. He had not &s;et John to enquire about
letters; he had not taken a hint from our hero as to Ireland; he had not wormed
the matter out of the ladies. On the contrary, a note had been received
explanatory of Ireland's flight on the very morning it happened, and the
intelligence had not been protracted out of tenderne&s;s to Charles, but to
cover the &s;afety of the &s;ugitive; for though a gentleman was &s;ent, as 
<PB N="291" REF="293"> our hero was informed, and did actually return with the
letter and oath already mentioned, yet Madame St. Vivier, who, to do her
ju&s;tice, was as willing as any body to &s;ave Charles, &s;tipulated however
that no arrangement &s;hould take place till Mr. Ire|land &s;hould be fully out
of danger. Then again there was no part of the conduct of the&s;e ladies
un|known to him. He knew why they went to Sedan; he was acce&s;&s;ary to the
lo&s;s of the money at Nancy; he even learnt that Kitty and Ireland were upon
the be&s;t terms; he con&s;ented when they went away to their taking that money
of which he pretended to have been robbed; and, la&s;tly, &s;o far from not
be|ing acquainted with John's departure for England, he &s;ent him there,
and&mdash;not to hide the truth&mdash;with proper in&s;tructions how our hero
&s;hould be written to: &s;o that he knew every word of Mr. Standfa&s;t's
letter before Charles received it.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins now began to be very inqui&s;itive as to our hero's
future plan. Charles &s;aid he &s;hould immediately write to Mr. Balance, and
if he found him willing to &s;upply him without the ceremony of going to
England, he &s;hould continue his tour as he originally intended; 
<Q REND="inline">'for,' &s;aid he, 'I &s;ee nothing in my native
country that &s;hould make me de&s;irous of returning to it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nor I either,' &s;aid Figgins, 'except it were
to cur&s;e them all round.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pretty advice indeed,' &s;aid Charles, with a
laugh: 'want a man deliberately to go &s;even hun|dred miles for no better
purpo&s;e than to put him|&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then may I be damned,' &s;aid Figgins, 'if
I think there is your fellow upon the face of the earth. Such prudence and
di&s;cernment at your age is truly a&s;toni&s;hing.'</Q></P>
<P>The reader &s;ees that Figgins did not want Charles to go to
England, but as he well knew the right kind of argument to hold with mankind,
the &s;tronger Charles's ob&s;tinacy appeared, the more he argued again&s;t it.
He &s;hewed how ea&s;y it would be to un|deceive Sir Sidney. He painted the
beauties of Annette; the danger of lo&s;ing her; the triumph of obtaining her
from his rival; till at length, being highly exhilirated with wine, he had
rea&s;on to re|pent of his warmth, for Charles, in the heat of his vivacity,
&s;aid &s;omething that implied a determina|tion to return.</P>
<P>Fortune however, envious perhaps of his having &s;o narrowly
e&s;caped an untimely end, or thinking <PB N="293" REF="295"> the hero of
&s;uch a hi&s;tory as this had not been long enough upon his probation, or bent
upon bringing about his cata&s;trophe, whatever it be, by the means of Mrs.
Emma, her agent, or for &s;ome other equally wi&s;e and con&s;iderate motive,
determined to give Charles good time to deliberate, before he &s;hould come to
any re&s;olution; for he was that night taken with a violent fever, which
la&s;ting him &s;everal days without the &s;malle&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion, and
&s;everal weeks with but very little, he was at length left in a mo&s;t
emaciated condition, with all the &s;ymptoms of a gradual decline.</P>
<P>The moment he was able he wrote to Mr. Ba|lance, without however
dropping a hint of his ill|ne&s;s, which precaution he enjoined Figgins al&s;o
to ob&s;erve, thinking, probably, it would look like an overture to a
reconciliation, which, had he even wi&s;hed, his pride would have forbid him to
ac|knowledge.</P>
<P>Indeed he was pretty re&s;olute as to his future in|tentions;
for though his bodily &s;trength was greatly impaired, his mental faculties
were at lea&s;t as &s;trong as ever.</P>
<P>This was the only &s;erious illne&s;s he had ever had in his
life. It had given him excellent time for re|flection, <PB N="294" REF="296">
and the more he reflected the le&s;s he &s;aw to be a&s;hamed of. In proportion
therefore as he found him&s;elf wronged, he per&s;i&s;ted in his firm
de|termination to con&s;ider him&s;elf independant, and accountable to no man
for his actions: and, as to enjoy the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch
principles he mu&s;t not have many friend&s;hips, he re&s;olved to continue his
tour, that, by gathering a plentiful &s;tock of ac|compli&s;hments, he might be
the better qualified to find a friend in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme he was al&s;o determined to pur&s;ue after his own
fancy, which part he dige&s;ted as de|liberately as the re&s;t. Taking
therefore an oppor|tunity one day, when the phy&s;ician advi&s;ed him to try
the air of Montpelier, he thus opened his mind to his friend Figgins.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear &s;ir, it would be but a poor return to
your warm and un&s;haken friend&s;hip, merely to &s;ay it will ever be
remembered by me with that &s;ort of heart-felt plea&s;ure every thing gives me
that originates from &s;uch hand&s;ome and liberal principles. It would however
be taking a very unfriendly advantage of you if I could be &s;o un|rea&s;onable
as to requite &s;o much genero&s;ity by &s;uf|fering you to neglect and injure
your affairs on my account.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="297"> 
<Q REND="inline">'My father has &s;ettled on you an annuity, to
which is now annexed no conditions on your &s;ide of attention to me; for he
being dead, his kind|ne&s;s mu&s;t naturally be con&s;idered as a remem|brance
of pa&s;t, in&s;tead of a reward for pre&s;ent, &s;ervices: but as I know your
worthy heart will not let you regard your&s;elf as entitled to this e&s;|teem,
unle&s;s you acquit your con&s;cience of re|ceiving it upon any other principle
than that of de&s;ert, in&s;tead of throwing away your time on me&mdash;time
which, at your &s;ea&s;on of life, mu&s;t be very precious to you, and which
you can without doubt employ to greater advantage in the bo&s;om of your family
and affairs&mdash;you &s;hall keep a con|&s;tant corre&s;pondence with me, and
I will promi&s;e to profit by that advantage as much as my capacity and
abilities permit me: &s;o now do not take it unkind that I &s;hould have
re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my travels alone, but rather let me have your excu&s;e
that I have already taken up &s;o much of your time, to your
prejudice.'</Q></P>
<P>It happened luckily for Mr. Figgins, that this was the very
&s;ubject he had him&s;elf been two or three times on the point of broaching,
but he felt &s;o awkward about it that he could not for the &s;oul of him tell
how to begin. Having however the ice broken for him, he did not &s;cruple to
acknowledge <PB N="296" REF="298"> that his affairs at home were rather in a
di&s;ordered condition, and that he &s;incerely believed, were he on the
&s;pot, a certain bi&s;hop would at that time have an opportunity of promoting
him: but yet he could not think of leaving his dear, his honoured friend; it
would look as if he was of a piece with the re&s;t of the world, and had
ba&s;ely de&s;erted his cau&s;e.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your own heart and my experience of your
ge|nerous friend&s;hip will, my dear Figgins,' &s;aid Charles, 'acquit you;

opinion of tho&s;e who take the freedom &s;o very liberally to talk of me, you
will retrieve your character in&s;tead of injure it, by quitting a man &s;o
unworthy to be &s;poken well of.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather,' &s;aid Figgins, if I am induced to
leave you, let it be with a view to confound any ra&s;cal who &s;hall dare to

your calumniators, and I a&s;&s;ure you neither Mr. Stand|fa&s;t, who&s;e

<Q REND="inline">'Figgins, if you would have me believe you value
either my friend&s;hip or peace of mind, imitate what I &s;hould do in the
&s;ame &s;ituation. When you hear any one vilify me, laugh in his face, without

<P>After a great deal of per&s;ua&s;ion on one &s;ide, and much
apparent reluctance on the other, it was a|greed upon that our hero and Mr.
Figgins &s;hould part. This they did with many warm prote&s;tations of
friend&s;hip, and future attention to each other's intere&s;t&mdash;on one
&s;ide I am &s;ure very &s;incere&mdash;and a firm promi&s;e to keep up a
regular corre&s;pon|dence.</P>
<P>Not two days after the departure of Mr. Fig|gins, Charles wrote
to Mr. Balance, by whom he had been treated, as to his money, in a very
gen|tlemanly manner, de&s;iring, without giving a &s;ingle rea&s;on, that he
would immediately grant out of his fortune a hundred a year to Mr. Figgins for
life; and about four hours after this letter was di&s;patched, he received one
from Emma, informing him of his brother's actual marriage&mdash;and al&s;o that
Lady Ha|zard was in a way to ble&s;s him with a &s;on and heir&mdash;the
di&s;comfiture of the Lady Dowager; the unal|tered <PB N="298" REF="300">
inflexibility of Sir Sidney; the neutrality of Lady Roebuck; the con&s;tancy of
Annette; a con|gratulation on his relea&s;e, which they had all heard from
&s;ome &s;py in the camp; to which &s;he added, pray God Mr. Figgins prove not
rather an Euri&s;|teus than a Pylades; a gentle reproach for his &s;i|lence; an
exhortation to return; 
<Q REND="inline">'but indeed,' &s;aid &s;he, 'to what purpo&s;e?
Ju&s;tice, come as am|ply as it may, can now &s;carcely make you amends. Of
what u&s;e was the pyramid to Ae&s;op after they had hurled him from the
rock?'</Q>&mdash;and la&s;tly, &s;he informed him that &s;he had a mo&s;t
formidable plot, which had already taken root, and when it &s;hould have grown,
blo&s;&s;omed, and borne fruit, &s;he doubted not but &s;he &s;hould gather a
plentiful crop of ju&s;tice to him, credit to her&s;elf, conviction to the
abu&s;ed, and confu&s;ion to his enemies.</P>
<P>Charles had not an&s;wered Emma's former letter, it is true, but
he was determined now to do &s;o once for all. This was his letter. 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY GOOD EMMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Your attention to me, to &s;peak in your own way, is a
panegyric on your&s;elf, and a lam|poon <PB N="299" REF="301"> on tho&s;e
around you; for even though I &s;hould de&s;erve all they have &s;o very
liberally laid to my charge, a little charity one &s;hould think would not do
them any harm. But I &s;ee the con|federacy is &s;trong, and had I the &s;hadow
of a wi&s;h to break it up&mdash;which I really have not&mdash;it would, I dare
&s;ay, be no ea&s;y matter.</P>
<P> Your information, as to your &s;weet young lady, is very
flattering, and, at any other time, would have been very delightful; but why
&s;hould I pur|&s;ue what I can never arrive at: &s;ince the folly of her own
family has made an union between us im|practicable? Be therefore, good
Emma&mdash;for upon my &s;oul you are really a good creature&mdash;a friend to
her, and in&s;tead of filling her ears with imagi|nary happine&s;s, which &s;he
can never enjoy&mdash;re|commend to her an ob&s;ervance of her duty, by which
&s;he will no doubt more fully accompli&s;h all her wi&s;hes. You will the more
readily induce her to this by a&s;&s;uring her, which you may with great truth,
that whatever may have been my &s;entiments, I am determined not to think of
her in future.&mdash;Indeed my intention, and that for many rea&s;ons, is never
to &s;ee her again, and without any ill com|pliment to your literary wi&s;dom,
I mu&s;t &s;ay you are a dunce if you do not &s;ee why.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="302"> As to Sir Sidney and the re&s;t of my
formidable accu&s;ers, I will not take the trouble to care what they think of
me; for, though I heartily forgive them&mdash;though I think pity is the
properer word&mdash;and would do them any &s;ervice I honourably
could&mdash;but I believe they think mine rather a &s;habby kind of
honour&mdash;yet the world &s;hould not purcha&s;e from me a grain of
friend&s;hip for them.</P>
<P> And now Emma, as you are &s;o kind as not to think me quite
the hang dog they have painted me, do pray believe that what I have &s;aid
above was dictated by &s;incerity; and, this admitted, your under&s;tanding
will tell you that I &s;hall be in&s;en|&s;ible to all per&s;ua&s;ion; for you
&s;ee, by my deli|beration, that the&s;e re&s;olutions are not the ca|price of
a moment. Seeing this, it will al&s;o &s;trike you as repugnant both to your
&s;afety and my ho|nour&mdash;which you know it would be a terrible thing not
to redeem&mdash;to hold farther conference on the &s;ubject. The &s;ame
rea&s;ons will &s;hew you the nece&s;&s;ity of dropping your plot. No, my
&s;trange, valuable, kind girl, keep the friend&s;hip of your patron; keep your
good opinion of me neverthele&s;s; and leave the re&s;t to time, who, according
to SHAKESAEARE&mdash;for you love a quo|tation&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"tries all old offenders,"</Q> and Time
be|ing <PB N="301" REF="303"> a very ju&s;t judge, I &s;hall never have any
ob|jection to appear before him.</P>
<P> Adieu: &s;hew your wi&s;hes to oblige me by im|plicitly
adhering to the contents of this letter.</P>

<PB REF="304">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING AN EVENT WHICH, HOWEVER SAGACIOUS THE READER MAY
BE, WILL NOT BE ANTICIPATED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES continued in a very weak &s;tate. As &s;oon therefore as
he had received from Mr. Balance &s;uch kind of authority as enabled him to
find him|&s;elf in ca&s;h, travel where he might, he complied with his
phy&s;ician's advice, and removed, by &s;hort &s;tages, to Montpelier, with
only a <HI>valet de chambre</HI> and a <HI>laquais,</HI> both Frenchmen: his
intention be|ing to &s;hun the Engli&s;h as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>His di&s;order for &s;ome time gave every appear|ance that if
the malignity of his friends went &s;o far as to wi&s;h him in the other world,
they would &s;oon be &s;atisfied. Perhaps &s;ome of them might have been happy
to have contemplated his &s;ituation.&mdash;Their charitable expectations
however would have been di&s;appointed, for his youth and con&s;titution
triumphed over the con&s;umption, and, what per|haps was a greater victory,
over the united efforts of the phy&s;icians; and at length&mdash;but not in
le&s;s <PB N="303" REF="305"> than &s;even months&mdash;his recovery was
pronounced to be certain.</P>
<P>I might here draw a &s;triking picture enough of a young man of
rank and fortune, with excellent talents, an admirable heart, young,
hand&s;ome, and &s;weet tempered, without a &s;ingle fault that might not be
defended upon principles of rea&s;on, hemmed in by an ho&s;t of enemies, and
apparently dying by him&s;elf in a remote corner of a &s;trange kingdom. All
this inter&s;per&s;ed with apt ob&s;ervation, and em|belli&s;hed with proper
reflections, would indeed make up good moral matter in this place, and give me
an opportunity of fini&s;hing the &s;econd volume with &s;ome very pretty,
round, well-turned reading:&mdash;but the bu&s;ine&s;s of this hi&s;tory
is&mdash;as indeed I think every other ought to be&mdash;action, which I give
the reader warning will be more and more rapid as we go on. I therefore beg,
that whoever &s;hall wi&s;h I had pau&s;ed at &s;uch and &s;uch a place, and
given my mu&s;e a bait, cramming down every mouthful with a moral &s;entence,
will &s;upply that &s;entence them|&s;elves, which will be more than one
advantage to me: it will &s;ave me the trouble; it will be more to the ta&s;te
of every reader; and it will give free &s;cope to all tho&s;e who think with
me, to go on without &s;kipping.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="306"> Charles did not want company at
Montpelier, for he did not want money. He had officers and abbes out of number,
and &s;ometimes ladies, and now and then an Engli&s;h gentleman in misfortunes,
who was not the wor&s;e for his trouble in vi&s;iting him. At other times he
read the be&s;t authors, and never lo&s;t any opportunity of &s;peaking French,
which he at la&s;t accompli&s;hed correctly and elegantly.</P>
<P>His health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ooner than his &s;trength.
On this account he &s;lowly vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the towns in the &s;outh of
France, where he met with a variety of characters, with who&s;e hi&s;tories,
were I &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, I could interlard my book, till, as I once heard an
Iri&s;hman &s;ay of a bad play, the main plot would be all epi&s;ode. I &s;hall
however, which is mode&s;t enough, chu&s;e but one, and now we are talking of
Iri&s;hmen, it &s;hall be a gentleman of that country; he &s;hall be a monk,
called Father Fitzgibbon, and member of a convent of Benedic|tines.</P>
<P>Our hero, becau&s;e perhaps he was in a wine country&mdash;for
&s;ick people are very whim&s;ical&mdash;took it in his head to long for &s;ome
beer; an inclination however he did not &s;eem likely to gratify, for en|quiry
had been repeatedly made for that beverage to <PB N="305" REF="307"> purpo&s;e.
His valet, who had a mo&s;t indulgent ma&s;ter&mdash;and they &s;ay a good
ma&s;ter makes a good &s;ervant&mdash;determining not to give the matter up
quietly, procured intelligence that about two leagues off there was a convent
of Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, and Scotch, where, for their own u&s;e, they brewed
excellent beer. To this convent, without &s;aying a word to Charles, he
po&s;ted. Having told his &s;tory, he re|ceived for an&s;wer, that they brewed
the beer for their own u&s;e, as he had heard, but, neverthele&s;s, if upon
paying them a vi&s;it they &s;hould like the gentleman, they would &s;upply him
with as much as he could drink. A card to this effect was di&s;|patched,
inviting Charles to dine with them the next day. He obeyed that &s;ummons and
&s;everal others, till, what with the beer, the good company, and the ride,
which I believe had mo&s;t merit&mdash;as the air in Wales performs that cure
which the phy|&s;icians attribute to the goat's milk&mdash;in a &s;hort time he
found him&s;elf in perfect health.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have mentioned this circum&s;tance &s;o minutely
had I not de&s;igned to introduce Father Fitzgibbon, who was &s;uperior of this
convent, to the reader, and I &s;hould not have introduced Fa|ther Fitzgibbon
to the reader if I had not had a material rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="308"> This friar was, as I have &s;aid, a
native of Ireland. He was of a good family, but being a younger bro|ther, he
quitted Dublin and went to Bath&mdash;the u&s;ual market&mdash;in &s;earch of a
fortune. There he contrived to lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e, where lodged al&s;o
an ancient lady and her daughter, the widow and heire&s;s of an old hunks, who
had ama&s;&s;ed a large fortune by boiling blubber at Deptford. It was
immaterial to him which he married, but he was determined upon one of them, and
that one &s;hould be her who was riche&s;t. This his intelligencers in|formed
him was the daughter, who being very ig|norant and conceited, and be&s;ides
be&s;et hard, yielded upon ea&s;ier terms than marriage, which conditions the
Iri&s;hman did not boggle about, becau&s;e for why, &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">'&s;ure can't I make you very happy after I have
ruined you for ever.'</Q></P>
<P>The appointment being made when and where this forward young
lady, for the fir&s;t time, was to yield up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
per&s;on to her intended hu&s;band, Fitzgibbon, which is not extraordinary in
an Iri&s;hman, made a blunder; for, mi&s;taking his way, in&s;tead of Mi&s;s's
room, he got into her mam|ma's, who expected a gallant likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Before the morning they di&s;covered their mutual mi&s;take, and
before the next morning Fitgibbon, <PB N="307" REF="309"> prevailed on the old
lady to rob the young lady of her fortune, with which they &s;et off for
France, and of which money, three years after, when this antiquated Venus died,
he had ju&s;t enough left to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion in the Iri&s;h
brigades. To be brief: After much riotous conduct, and many mi&s;demeanours, he
was broken, when the church,&mdash;which is in France &s;omething like what we
&s;ay in England of the &s;ea and the gallows&mdash;received him.</P>
<P>He had been &s;uperior of this convent of Benedic|tines four
years, and at the end of three more he was to vi&s;it his own country for a
twelvemonth, when he a&s;&s;ured our hero he would &s;pend a month with him in
England.</P>
<P>For a few hours, at a time of vacant hilarity, Charles could not
be in more agreeable company. He laid him&s;elf out for their convenience,
&s;ent them &s;everal de&s;irable pre&s;ents, and left, at his departure, a
hand&s;ome donation, which Fitzgibbon did not &s;cruple to tell him, in a
whi&s;per, &s;hould be laid out in excellent claret.</P>
<P>Charles had &s;tayed &s;o long in France that the time was now
nearly arrived which he had intended to have apportioned to his whole tour: for
his promi&s;e to his father had been to return in time to pa&s;s his birth|day 
<PB N="308" REF="310"> with him, when he &s;hould have attained his one and
twentieth year. He therefore determined to go back to England, in order to take
his affairs into his own hands, after which, if he &s;hould feel him&s;elf &s;o
di&s;po&s;ed, he might then be in time to make his tour of Italy; for &s;o far
from having any body to con|trol him, he did not think there were &s;ix
per&s;ons upon the face of the earth who cared three-pence about him. In this
mind he &s;et out, with a view to &s;tay a month at Paris, and then jog on
lei&s;urely for England. He arrived at Aix la Chapelle late in the evening,
where he &s;upped, and then ordered po&s;t hor&s;es to be ready the next
morning. The hou&s;e &s;eemed to be very full of gue&s;ts, and ju&s;t as our
hero got into bed, they were reinforced by a compa|ny from the play. Charles
had been dropt a&s;leep about an hour, when he was, all on a &s;udden, awoke by
a violent &s;creaming. For a moment&mdash;which is very natural in a &s;trange
bed&mdash;he knew not where he was. Recollecting him&s;elf however, he hurried
on his breeches and &s;lippers, and throwing a morning gown over him, took his
&s;word, and darted from his own chamber to that from whence the noi&s;e
i&s;&s;ued. The door was locked, but he bur&s;t it open with his foot, and
immediately &s;aw a French officer &s;trug|gling with a young lady, who &s;till
&s;hrieked with all her force. With the hilt of his &s;word he &s;truck the
ravi&s;her in a moment to the ground, then placing <PB N="309" REF="311">
him&s;elf between him and the young lady, he &s;tood ready for him, in a
po&s;ture of defence, again&s;t he &s;hould attempt to ri&s;e. At the moment he
placed him&s;elf in this attitude, rou&s;e reader your whole
at|tention!&mdash;exert your whole &s;tock of penetration!&mdash;prepare for a
mo&s;t unlooked-for &s;urpri&s;e!&mdash;yet, let it be ever &s;o great, it
cannot be any thing equal to that of our hero, when, on looking towards the
door, he &s;aw &s;everal per&s;ons enter the chamber, and, among the
foremo&s;t, Sir Sidney, Lady Roebuck, and Emma!</P>
<P>Reader, it was Annette her&s;elf whom Charles had re&s;cued from
a ravi&s;her!&mdash;who having in the fifteen months that he had been ab&s;ent
ripened into wo|man, and improved in every limb and feature into more
perfection than ever was de&s;cribed by the able&s;t pen or correcte&s;t
pencil; nay had the be&s;t poet or painter that ever wrote or drew &s;een her,
like our hero, at that moment, and even felt the &s;ame cap|tivating
&s;en&s;ation from the a&s;toni&s;hing power of her irre&s;i&s;table charms,
then &s;o greatly heightened, &s;till mu&s;t a de&s;cription of them have been
incomplete: for neither are there words nor colours &s;trong enough for the
ta&s;k. Charles, though he had but a mo|ment, which was imperfectly lent him by
the rela|tive intelligence received from &s;eeing who entered the room, in that
moment gazed away his &s;oul; <PB N="310" REF="312"> his very brain received
the whole force of her in|comparable attractions, and love took triumphant
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>During this interval, &s;hort as it was, the officer had got up,
un&s;een by our hero, and was coming to|wards him. This con&s;trained him to
transfer his attention from the lady to the gentleman. He a&s;ked, in a firm
voice if he dared ju&s;tify his conduct; to which he was an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">'No &s;ir; it was unpardona|ble. It was wine, it
was di&s;traction! I have &s;uf|fered an ignominious blow, but I de&s;erved it,
and you are a &s;tranger. No &s;ir, I &s;hall a&s;k for no &s;a|tisfaction; for
light and blameable as I may have behaved, though my exi&s;tence depends on my
courage, and the &s;word is my profe&s;&s;ion, I dare not draw it in a
di&s;honourable cau&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P> Sir Sidney, who at fir&s;t thought very differently of this
bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially when he heard Emma exclaim as they approached the
chamber, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Chri&s;t, there is Mr. Hazard!'</Q> felt,
from the &s;tronge&s;t conviction, a warm glow of gratitude to|wards our hero.
This however was a little checked by reflection, as well as a contemplation of
what Charles was then doing, who, forgetting there were a number of
&s;pectators pre&s;ent, &s;tood like a &s;tatue, devouring with his eyes the
beauty of Annette, <PB N="311" REF="313"> which was now heightened by
con&s;cious innocence and thankful plea&s;ure. In this &s;hort interval,
dur|ing which Sir Sidney deliberated, Annette was mo|de&s;tly delighted, Emma
hugged her&s;elf, and our hero was fa&s;cinated, in came to their relief Mr.
Glo&s;s, who being in a few words informed of the bu&s;ine&s;s, went up in a
&s;tyle of the greate&s;t familia|rity to Charles, and &s;eizing him by the
hand, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear &s;ir, how do you do? I thought you
were in Italy. For God's &s;ake why don't you let your friends hear from
you?'</Q> Charles flung from him in great indignation, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know you &s;ir,'</Q> and was making
towards the door, but Sir Sidney, who could not bear to receive a &s;ervice of
&s;uch magnitude without noticing it, &s;topt him, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot refrain from warmly acknow|ledging
this unexpected kindne&s;s, which has been as bravely and gallantly, as
di&s;intere&s;tedly, &s;hewn me. You know Mr. Hazard I have a warm heart, and a
generous action touches it; therefore, this of yours, which has probably
&s;aved my honour, I &s;hall not, you may be a&s;&s;ured, think lightly of; and
if&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Surely,' &s;aid Charles, recovering him&s;elf
into a complacent, yet erect dignity, 'you je&s;t Sir Sid|ney! What I have done
is at be&s;t but a common duty, which requires no partial thanks, becau&s;e 
<PB N="312" REF="314"> the greate&s;t &s;tranger would have been equally
en|titled to it. But how do you know it was not the act of one ravi&s;her
anxious to defeat the de|&s;igns of another? I dare &s;ay it will have that
colour by to-morrow morning. In the mean time you &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured I am
hone&s;t in &s;omething, nor will you doubt it when I tell you that what|ever
motive induced me to that which has pre|&s;erved Mi&s;s Roebuck's honour to her
family, it was not friend&s;hip to her father: and &s;o &s;ir, good night to
you.'</Q> So &s;aying, he bowed re&s;pectfully to the ladies, and left the
room.</P>
