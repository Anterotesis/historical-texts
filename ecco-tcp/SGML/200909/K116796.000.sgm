<HEAD>FOR PUBLISHING, PERIODICALLY, A COLLECTION OF MATHEMATICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL TRACTS AND SELECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Utility of a Work of this kind will appear evident in reflecting that a multitude of valuable Tracts, both Mathe|matical and Philo&s;ophical, are inter&s;per&s;ed among voluminous collections and expen&s;ive publications, and are otherwi&s;e inacce&s;&s;i|ble to the generality of readers.</P>
<P>To collect and pre&s;erve &s;uch Tracts, to compre&s;s them into a &s;mall compa&s;s, and to arrange them in a convenient form, are the objects of the Editors of the Publication which is now offered to the Patronage and Encouragement of the Scientific World.</P>
<P>It is not intended to confine the &s;election to Engli&s;h Works, but occa&s;ionally to tran&s;late tho&s;e in other languages which appear to de&s;erve places in this Collection.</P>
<P>The Editors propo&s;e to publi&s;h a Volume annually; or oftener, if it be found nece&s;&s;ary and they meet with &s;ufficient encourage|ment; to contain portions of &s;everal valuable tracts, each paged &s;eparately, &s;o that, when complete, they may be bound in di&s;tinct volumes, or in any manner the purcha&s;er may think proper. A part of each volume will al&s;o be re&s;erved for the in&s;ertion of &s;horter extracts and original Communications, which in time will form a valuable mi&s;cellaneous volume.</P>
<P>Having briefly &s;tated the OUTLINES of their PLAN, the Editors pre&s;ume to think that the execution of it will be attended with con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the Public and to Science. And in order to render it as perfect as po&s;&s;ible, they will thankfully receive any Hints for its Improvement, addre&s;&s;ed (Po&s;t-paid) to Mr. Glen|dinning, Book&s;eller, No. 25, Hatton-Garden, London; Mr. T. Bulmer, Sunderland; Mr. Richard Kay, Aberford, York; Mr. Wm. Wallace, Perth Academy; Mr. John Henry Swale, Che&s;|ter; Mr. John Lowry, Birimingham; or Mr. N. Bo&s;worth, Peterborough.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Volume is now in the Pre&s;s and will &s;oon appear: tho&s;e Gentlemen who wi&s;h to encourage the Work will plea&s;e to &s;ignify their intention, by applying to their re&s;pective Book&s;ellers for the Work.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>The Editor is &s;orry to be again under the nece&s;&s;ity of apologi&s;ing for the late appearance of his Publication, He is confident, however, of having his apology accepted when he a&s;&s;ures his
<PB N="2" REF="3">readers that the delay was occa&s;ioned by circum&s;tances which he was unable to prevent, and that mea&s;ures have been taken which it is hoped will en&s;ure the regular appearance of each Number in future. One of the&s;e is, a determination to prepare the copy for the pre&s;s immediately after the limited time is expired, without waiting for any further Communications. While, therefore, the Editor returns his mo&s;t grateful thanks to his kind contributors for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, he begs leave to intreat that they will &s;end their favours early; and he tru&s;ts the &s;malle&s;t reflection will convince them of the propriety of the re&s;triction he has adopted.</P>
<P>The Editor has not continued Mr. <HI>Wallace's</HI> Paper on PORISMS, becau&s;e it is intended for in&s;ertion in "A Collection of Mathe|matical and Philo&s;ophical Tracts and Selections"; Propo&s;als for publi&s;hing which, accompany this Number.</P>
<P>It is intended, in each &s;ucceeding Number, to in&s;ert accounts of new Mathematical and Philo&s;ophical Publications, and &s;hort bio|graphical Notices of eminent Mathematicians and Philo&s;ophers, recently decea&s;ed. Impartial and authentic Communications for the&s;e articles will always be thankfully received.</P>
<P>The Editor will be much obliged to tho&s;e Gentlemen who favour him with new que&s;tions, as much as po&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e &s;uch as will be of real utility in the various branches, and will generally admit of neat, accurate, and &s;atisfactory an&s;wers; he has al&s;o to reque&s;t that &s;uch of his corre&s;pondents as &s;end him &s;olutions, will be at the trouble to work them throughout, and give the re&s;ult as well as the method of &s;olution. This would undoubtedly give more &s;atisfaction to the readers of the Repo&s;itory, and at the &s;ame time add to the reputation of its ingenious contributors.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf alluded to in one of the Replies to Mr. Jogglebelly's E&s;&s;ay on Negroes, would have had his letter in&s;erted, had he not de&s;cended to &s;uch low and vulgar language as would have di&s;graced the Repo&s;itory. It is hoped he will, on recon&s;idering his letter, acquie&s;ce in this opinion, and that he will al&s;o, on further delibration, think the Editor has acted with propriety in not publi&s;hing his very violent remarks on an Individual, whom he can a&s;&s;ure him, he has, in this ca&s;e, unju&s;tly accu&s;ed. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e objections the Letter of L. M. on the &s;ame &s;ubject, is al&s;o liable, and on <HI>that account</HI> is inadmi&s;&s;ible. The Editor wi&s;hes by all means to encourage fair and liberal di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, but he can never con&s;ent to make his work the vehicle of &s;currility and abu&s;e in&s;tead of argument and candour.</P>
<P>Librus, of Walton, is informed, in an&s;wer to his enquiry con|cerning Mr. Gregory's "Le&s;&s;ons, A&s;tronomical and Philo&s;ophical," that the Editor has not been able to procure him a copy, but he has &s;ince heard that a new Edition of that u&s;eful performance, enlarged and improved, is ju&s;t publi&s;hed by Mr. CONDER, No. 30, Buck|er&s;bury, London.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">Mr. Keith's Trigonometry is now in the Pre&s;s and will &s;oon appear.</P>
<P>A Silver Medal will be determined by Lot, as before, among three of the be&s;t an&s;werers to each of the Prize Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>On account of the late appearance of this Number is is propo&s;ed to delay the publication of Number IX. until the fir&s;t of May, 1800, and to extend the time for receiving Communications to the 15th of January. All letters received after that time will po&s;itively be too late for in&s;ertion in that Number.</P>
<P>Number X. will be ready on the fir&s;t of November, 1800, and all letters intended for its u&s;e mu&s;t come to hand by the 15th of July, or they will be too late.</P>
<P><HI>New Editions of Numbers I. and II. will be publi&s;hed &s;peedily.</HI></P>
<P>Communications, <HI>Po&s;t-paid,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed either to Mr. Glendin|ning, No. 25, Hatton-Garden; Mr. O. Gregory, Cambridge; Mr. T. Bulmer, Sunderland; or Mr. N. Bo&s;worth, Peterborough, will be thankfully received, and duly forwarded to the Editor.</P>
