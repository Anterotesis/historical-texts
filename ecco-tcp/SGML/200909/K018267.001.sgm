<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WE have taken the earlie&s;t opportunity that a judicious in&s;pection, and mature con&s;idera|tion of events could give us, of pre&s;enting to the public, A COMPLEAT HISTORY OF THE LATE WAR, not le&s;s important than, we hope, u&s;eful and correct, written with an impartiality which &s;hould be the guide of every hi&s;torian, and from which we have not deviated through national affection.</P>
<P>WE have taken up our HISTORY from the commencement of the war, and have be&s;towed all the pains upon it, &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject re|quires, which, however, we mu&s;t acknowledge, de&s;erves much more &s;kilful workmen. None was ever more formed to excite curio&s;ity, from the importance of events, the dignity of the per|&s;ons engaged, the greatne&s;s of the actions per|formed, and the amazing revolutions of fortune; for the Reader will here find the &s;cattered ac|counts of this war, which has been carried on in the four quarters of the world, united in one connected narrative, and continued to the peace.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">To effect this from the materials that offered, has been a work of more labour, than may at fir&s;t appear, and to render the&s;e tran&s;actions (which have not been le&s;s our amazement, than the world's in general) the more con&s;picuous and clear, we have added, in Notes, the accounts tran&s;mitted from the commanders of our fleets and armies, and publi&s;hed by authority, when facts were recent, and the immediate object of univer&s;al attention. The&s;e will illu&s;trate and confirm the Hi&s;tory; and our readers mu&s;t be plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many curious and important pieces, which while they give the cleare&s;t evi|dence, &s;upport the national character to future ages. In many places we find them filled with the actions of inferior officers, which, with le&s;s care in their &s;uperiors, would have been lo&s;t in the multiplicity of events: This care, not le&s;s commendable than u&s;eful, will excite officers to &s;eize every opportunity of immortalizing their fame, and doing honour to their re&s;pective corps. Some of the&s;e letters mu&s;t be u&s;eful in forming the young &s;oldier, as they are very expre&s;&s;ive of that character, pointing out the care, circum|&s;pection, anxiety, and per&s;everance to form a WOLFE, or a GRANBY.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Origin of the troubles in North America. Admiral Bo&s;|cawen and General Braddock &s;ent thither. Operations intended. Two French men of war taken. Braddock defeated. Gen. John&s;on repul&s;es the French. French threaten an inva&s;ion. Fort St. Philip be&s;ieged and taken. Treaty with Ru&s;&s;ia, the &s;pirit of it. Alliance with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Ground of the Quarrel between her Im|perial Maje&s;ty and that Monarch. Treaty of Peter&s;bourg. Treaty of Ver&s;ailles. King of Pru&s;&s;ia enters Saxony and Bohemia. Battle of Lowo&s;itz. Saxon army &s;urrenders.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE original plan of this work propo&s;ed no more than, that each volume &s;hould contain a narra|tive of tho&s;e events which di&s;tingui&s;h its own Year. But, becau&s;e we have entered upon our undertaking in the heat of an almo&s;t general and very im|portant war, I thought it would not be unnece&s;&s;ary or di&s;agreeable to look a little farther back. It would be difficult, perfectly to under&s;tand the operations of the &s;everal powers at war, without reviewing the tran|&s;actions of the preceding years; nor would it be ea&s;y
<PB N="2" REF="18">
to enter into the &s;pirit of the&s;e, without examining the cau&s;es which more nearly or remotely operated to produce tho&s;e troubles that have involved &s;o many parts of the world in one common di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The war in which all parties and intere&s;ts &s;eem now to be &s;o perfectly blended, aro&s;e from cau&s;es which originally had not the lea&s;t connection: the uncertain limits of the Engli&s;h and French territories in America; and the mutual claims of the Hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Brandenbourg on the dutchy of Sile&s;ia. It is no wonder that the two former powers &s;eizing on a country in which they con&s;idered the right of the natural Inhabitants as nothing, &s;hould find it a very difficult matter to &s;ettle their own. For a long time neither of the&s;e powers were &s;ufficiently acquainted with the geography of America, to enable them to a&s;certain the limits of their &s;everal preten&s;ions with any tolerable exact|ne&s;s; nor, indeed, were the&s;e matters deemed of &s;uffici|ent moment to call for a very laborious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. At the treaty of Utrecht, whil&s;t &s;o many more important Intere&s;ts, or what then &s;eemed more important, were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the limits of Nova Scotia, then called Acadia, were expre&s;&s;ed only in general terms, and left to be put on a more certain footing by &s;ub&s;equent negotiations. The&s;e negotiations pur&s;ued with no vigour, and drawn out into an exce&s;&s;ive length, &s;eemed only to increa&s;e the former confu&s;ion. After the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Royal Family, a French connection, perhaps nece&s;&s;ary from the circum&s;tances of the time, and afterwards a certain negligence of all affairs but tho&s;e of our dome&s;tic polity, &s;uffered this important point to vani&s;h almo&s;t wholly out of our con&s;i|deration. During this interval, our colonies on the con|tinent of North Amerca, extended them&s;elves on every &s;ide. Whil&s;t agriculture and the maritime commerce flou|ri&s;hed on their coa&s;ts, the Indian trade drew &s;everal of our wandering dealers far into the inland country, and beyond the great mountains. Here they found them&s;elves in a de|lightful climate, in a &s;oil abundantly fruitful, and watered with many fair and navigable rivers. The&s;e advantages, joined to tho&s;e of the Indian trade, appeared to compen&s;ate for its remotene&s;s from the &s;ea. It was judged, that as the fir&s;t &s;ettlers on the coa&s;t, we had a good right to the inland country; and, if &s;o, to the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which opened another door to the ocean. With the&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="19">
views, a company of merchants and planters, obtained a charter for a con&s;iderable tract of land near the river Ohio, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Alleganey mountains, but within the province of Virginia; and the adventurers be|gan to &s;ettle pur&s;uant to the terms of their patent.</P>
<P>Now began to &s;hoot forth the &s;eeds of another di&s;pute, which had long lain unob&s;erved, but which proved alto|gether as thorny and intricate as that concerning the limits of Acadia. The French pretending to have fir&s;t di&s;co|vered the mouths of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, claimed the whole adjacent country, towards New Mexico on the ea&s;t, quite to the Apalachian or Alleganey mountains on the we&s;t. They drove off the new &s;ettlers, and built a new fort called du Que&s;ne, on the forks of the River Monongahela, a &s;ituation which commanded the entrance into all the coun|try on the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve, that I do not pretend to decide concerning the right of either nation in this conte&s;t. It is evident enough, that the con&s;ideration of the right had much le&s;s influence on both parties, than the con&s;ideration of conveniency. Should the French be able to unite Ca|nada to their colonies at the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi by a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that va&s;t country which lies between them, the Engli&s;h colonies mu&s;t lo&s;e all &s;hare in the Indian trade in time of peace; and in time of war be expo&s;ed to conti|nual dangers, or to the ruinou&s;ly chargeable defence of a frontier more than 1500 miles in length. If on the con|trary, the French &s;hould fail to make good the&s;e claims on the Ohio, and tho&s;e on Nova Scotia, their two colo|nies entirely di&s;united, and the entrance into one &s;hut up for the winter &s;ea&s;on by fro&s;t, and the entrance into the other difficult in all &s;ea&s;ons by the banks at the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ppi, mu&s;t certainly lo&s;e all their value to France, and in their fall involve much of the fortune of their great &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1755."> Both nations being fully per&s;uaded of this, no longer looked on the affair of the Ohio as a matter of indifference. They prepared to cut the gordian knot of the long and in|tricate negotiation by the &s;word. Ships were fitted out, and &s;ome troops &s;ilently &s;ent off from Bre&s;t. General Braddock &s;ailed to Virginia with about 1500 regular troops;



 24 men of war under the Admirals Bo&s;|cawen and Mo&s;tyn were ordered to America, to in|tercept the French &s;upplies. Orders were &s;ent to our
<PB N="4" REF="20">
colonies to arm; and three operations were actually under|taken, one again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne under Braddock; the other two again&s;t the French forts in Nova Scotia, and the fort of Crown Point on the Frontiers of New York. The two courts in the mean time breathed nothing but peace, and exchanged reciprocal profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, and good will, which deceived neither party.</P>
<P>They who are of opinion that the pa&s;&s;ions and characters of the ruling men influence all public concerns as much as the public intere&s;ts them&s;elves, thought they &s;aw other cau&s;es operating to ha&s;ten this breach. On the death of a great Mini&s;ter, which happened &s;ome time before, the admini&s;tration was new moulded. Some per&s;ons then taken in, were con&s;idered as belonging to a party not perfectly united with the remains of the old admini&s;tration. It was thought, that the leading man of this party propo&s;ed to work out the old Servants of the crown, in order to make way for a more uniform &s;y&s;tem. As long as peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, government is &s;upported by it&s;elf; and any change is dif|ficult. But the conduct of a war, is a thing critical to a mini&s;try. The leader of this party therefore, con&s;cious of his own talents, which all men acknowledged to be con|&s;picuous, and of his connections which were con&s;iderable, warmly pu&s;hed on a war, &s;econded by the fairne&s;s of the public motives, and the general voice of the people. In this war his friends relied, that things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, that the old party would find them&s;elves obliged to retire, and to leave the &s;tage clear for them to &s;erve their country according to their own plans, and on their own terms. This de&s;ign was believed to be pu&s;hed forward by another great man of that party, who had play|ed a game nearly of the &s;ame kind before, and in whom an advanced age had not abated any thing of his natural fire and love of violent councils.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="June 10."> Things came to a cri&s;is by the taking of two French men of war by the Admirals Bo&s;cawen and Mo&s;|tyn.

 

 The operations by land were carried on with vigour; but whether conducted with equal judg|ment, we &s;tand too near the time to decide. However, the French fort at Beau&s;ejour was taken, and &s;oon after tho&s;e on St. John's river were abandoned;

 

 by which we remained ma&s;ters of all Nova Scotia. <MILESTONE N="June 16."> The principal expedition was that again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne,

under General Braddock. That General abounding too much in his own &s;en&s;e for the degree of military knowledge he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, commanding in a country which he did not know, and carrying on a &s;pecies of war in which he had no experience, &s;uffered him&s;elf, when he had advanced within 10 miles of Fort du Que&s;ne, to be &s;urpri&s;ed by an ambu&s;|cade of French and Indians. <MILESTONE N="July 9."> His army was &s;eiz|ed with a panic from the unu&s;ual appearance,

 

 and horried cries of the &s;avages; they fled in confu|&s;ion; they were totally defeated with a con&s;iderable &s;laugh|ter, e&s;pecially of their officers. The General him&s;elf, after having five hor&s;es killed under him, was mortally wounded; wiping away all the errors of his conduct by an honourable death for his country.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Sep. 7."> The nation was &s;omething con&s;oled for this lo&s;s in the &s;ignal advantage gained by General John&s;on, who com|manded the expedition de&s;igned again&s;t Crown Point.

 

 He was attacked in his intrenchments by the French General Die&s;kau, but the a&s;&s;ailants wanting cannon, and firing from too great a di&s;tance, were totally defeated, and Die&s;kau him&s;elf was made pri&s;oner. This victory, tho' very honourable for Mr. John&s;on and the provincial troops under his command, yet as it was gained late in the &s;ea&s;on, and as the army was in no very good condition, it had no con&s;equences. On the whole, we &s;eemed, after allowing for this victory, and for the di&s;|lodgment of the French from Nova Scotia, to have had the wor&s;t part in the campaign; con&s;idering the &s;anguine ex|pectations which had been formed, and the great &s;uperiori|ty of &s;trength which we exerted, or were able to have ex|erted, in that part of the world.</P>
<P>During this &s;ummer, our court took a re&s;olution not to wait the precarious operation of our arms in America for redre&s;s of the grievances complained of, but to &s;trike &s;uch a blow as would at once put a &s;ecurity into our hands, for the evacuating the places the enemy had fortified in our territories, and di&s;able them in the two mo&s;t material points, the re&s;ources of their trade, and their &s;eamen. Their merchant &s;hips were every where attacked, as if war had been actually declared, and va&s;t numbers brought into our ports. The French made all Europe re&s;ound with com|plaints of what they called a proceeding &s;o unju&s;t, and a violation of the law of nations &s;o flagrant and unprecedent|ed.
<PB N="6" REF="23">
But, whether it was that they were really in no con|dition to act, or that they intended to influence the other courts in their favour, by a &s;hew of extraordinary modera|tion, they contented them&s;elves with this, and neither de|clared war, nor made any &s;ort of repri&s;al for &s;everal months after. <MILESTONE N="1756."> At lenght they began to act; &s;everal bodies of troops moved to the coa&s;ts of Picardy,

The mini&s;try &s;eemed to have been infected with the common terror; for though they had very early notice or the French de&s;igns, &s;uch was the apprehen&s;ion of the inva&s;ion, or &s;uch the ill-contrived di&s;po&s;ition of our navy, that Admiral Byng was not di&s;patched to the Mediterranean before the 5th of April, and then with a &s;quadron of no more than 10 &s;hips of the line.</P>

Our affairs were in &s;uch a Condition that we were driven to the expe|dient
<PB N="7" REF="24">
of a court martial to revive the Briti&s;h &s;pirit, and to the unfortunate nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hedding the blood of an Admiral, a per&s;on of a noble family,



 as a &s;a|crifice to the di&s;cipline of our navy.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="Feb. 14. 1757."> From this melancholy picture, let us turn our eyes ano|ther way, and review the &s;teps by which this war came to involve the re&s;t of the contending powers. The French, among&s;t the other plans they formed for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing our affairs, made no &s;ecret of their de&s;ign of attacking his Maje&s;ty's German dominions. The&s;e countries evi|dently had no &s;ort of connexion with the matters which gave ri&s;e to the war. But being under a Sovereign &s;o remarkably affectionate to his native country; they judged he might be terrified into a relaxation of his rights in America, to pre&s;erve Hanover from the calamities with which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> threatened. Their politics, however, in this in&s;tance proved as un&s;ucce&s;sful as they were unju&s;t. No motion was made towards an abatement in our claims with regard to America; his Maje&s;ty took other methods for the pre&s;ervation of the peace of Germany. His Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects by their repre&s;entatives, not more generou&s;ly than rea|&s;onably, re&s;olved to defend the Hanoverians if attacked in their quarrel. To an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, the mini&s;try enter|ed into a &s;ub&s;idy treaty with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, in virtue of which &s;he was to hold 55,000 men in readine&s;s to be &s;ent on a requi&s;ition wherever the Briti&s;h &s;ervice re|quired.</P>
<P>The alliance with Ru&s;&s;ia was cho&s;en for rea&s;ons which were then &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible; though it is to be hoped they can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t again. The long ill under&s;tanding between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and our court, and his clo&s;e connexion with that of Ver&s;ailles, rai&s;ed no ill-grounded apprehen&s;ions that he might be induced to act a dangerous part on this occa&s;ion. Ru&s;&s;ia was therefore a proper ally, who had both a political and per&s;onal enmity to this mo|narch, and who would be &s;ure to employ a great power with great vigour in &s;uch a cau&s;e. But this &s;y&s;tem was in a &s;hort time totally rever&s;ed. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had been too well appri&s;ed of the clo&s;e conjunction of the courts of Peter&s;burg and Vienna, and of the real motive to that conjunction, to have the lea&s;t de&s;ign of embroiling him&s;elf with England. Matters were therefore very &s;oon explain|ed, and the treaty between his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty and this
<PB N="8" REF="25">
court, to keep all foreigners out of the Empire, was &s;igned at London in January 1756. The&s;e treaties were cen&s;ured as incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; but in reality they were con&s;i&s;tent enough, aiming preci&s;ely at the &s;ame object, to oppo&s;e the &s;chemes meditated by France for di&s;turbing the affairs of Germany.</P>
<P>If reflecting on the &s;entiments of the&s;e courts, there was &s;omething unexpected in the alliance between great Bri|tain and Pru&s;&s;ia; it was &s;oon followed by another alliance of a nature infinitely more &s;urpri&s;ing. The Empre&s;s Queen of Hungary, finding England in no di&s;po&s;ition to co-operate in her de&s;igns, had recour&s;e to other mea&s;ures. The hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which had formerly united Europe to pre&s;erve her from the power of France, now entered her&s;elf into the mo&s;t intimate union with that power. By this extraordinary revolution the whole political &s;y&s;tem of Europe a&s;&s;umed a new face; it was indeed a revolution &s;o extraordinary, that we &s;hall be ju&s;tified if we interrupt the cour&s;e of this narrative, to look back at the cau&s;es which produced it.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Brandenbourg, a little more than two cen|turies ago, was in a very humble condition. But by the part &s;he took in the reformation, which put into her hands the e&s;tates of the Teutonic order; by a marriage from which &s;he acquired the duchy of Cleves; and by an un|common &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able princes who carefully improved every turn in the affairs of Germany to their advantage, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf by degrees to a con&s;iderable &s;tate, to an electorate, and at la&s;t to a royalty, not only in name but in power. The late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in order to &s;trengthen this power, though he pa&s;t almo&s;t his whole reign in the mo&s;t profound peace, gave his whole attention to his army; frugal in all other re&s;pects, in this alone he was expen&s;ive; it was his bu&s;ine&s;s, and what was perhaps of greater mo|ment, it was his only diver&s;ion. Thus in a reign apparently inactive, there was always kept up an army of near 100,000 men, in as much exerci&s;e as they could have in war, and formed with the mo&s;t perfect di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>When his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty came to the throne, he imme|diately &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition of employing effectually that military force, which his father had &s;pent his life only in forming and training. He managed his di&s;pute with the Bi&s;hop of Liege by the &s;ummary method of force; and &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to carry all things with &s;o high an hand, as
<PB N="9" REF="26">
made him indeed much re&s;pected, but much dreaded too by the Princes of the Empire, who &s;aw that there was another power to be feared in Germany, be&s;ides that of Au&s;tria. But the&s;e were &s;mall matters, rather &s;igns of the di&s;po&s;ition of this Prince, than exertions of it. He medi|tated much greater things; and only waited an opportu|nity to make good the antient claims of his family on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the dutchy of Sile&s;ia. The right to that dutchy had been a very intricate affair; but the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria availing her&s;elf of the greatne&s;s of her power, and of a di&s;&s;ention between the Elector Frederick II. and his &s;on, prevailed with the Elector to give up that right for an equivalent; then &s;he per&s;uaded his &s;on to con|firm the treaty; and at the &s;ame time for a trivial con&s;i|deration to give up the equivalent it&s;elf. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, not thinking him&s;elf bound by the&s;e acts, though confirmed be a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, took advantage of his own power, and the embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, to re&s;ume what their power and the embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of his family had formerly deprived him of. For immediately on the death of Charles the 6th,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 1740."> 

 when the Au&s;trian greatne&s;s &s;eemed irrecoverably lo&s;t, he entered into Sile&s;ia, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole country with little oppo&s;ition. Then uniting with the French and Bavarians, he &s;ecured his conque&s;ts by two deci&s;ive victories,

 <MILESTONE N="June 11. 1742,"> 

 and by a trea|ty which yielded him the greate&s;t part of Sile&s;ia and the whole county of Glatz. But the cau&s;e of the Emperor which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had embraced, &s;oon cau&s;ed a renewal of ho&s;tilities; the Queen of Hungary &s;aw her&s;elf defeated in three pitched battles; her new ally the King of Poland,

 <MILESTONE N="June 2, 1744,"> 

 driven from his German dominions, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia entering Dre&s;den in triumph, where he gave the law in a treaty, by which Sile&s;ia was once more &s;olemnly confirmed to him:

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 1745."> 

 in return to which he guarantied to the Queen of Hungary the re&s;t of her dominions.</P>
<P>The Queen of Hungary could not ea&s;ily lo&s;e the me|mory of the wound &s;he had received in the lo&s;s of one of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t parts of all her dominions. Sile&s;ia, which &s;he had ju&s;t yielded, extended in length 200 miles along the cour&s;e of the large and navigable river Oder.
<PB N="10" REF="27">
A country of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fertility and highe&s;t cultiva|tion; abounding with men, abounding with valuable manu|factures, and yielding a clear yearly revenue of 800,000 pounds &s;terling. The peace was hardly concluded by which &s;he re&s;igned this valuable territory, than &s;he &s;et on foot practices for recovering it. She entered into a treaty with the court of Peter&s;bourg, of an innocent and &s;imply defen|&s;ive nature, &s;o far as appeared to the public; but &s;ix &s;ecret and &s;eparate articles were added to it;

 <MILESTONE N="May 22, 1746,"> 

 one of which provides, that in ca&s;e his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty &s;hould attack her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s Queen, or the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, or even the republic of Poland, that this attack &s;hould be con&s;idered as a breach of the treaty of Dre&s;den; that the right of the Empre&s;s Queen to Sile&s;ia ceded by that treaty &s;hould revive; and that the contracting powers &s;hould mutually furni&s;h an army of 60,000 men to re-inve&s;t the Empre&s;s Queen with that dutchy.</P>
<P>To this &s;o extraordinary a treaty, the King of Poland was invited to accede; and he did &s;o far accede to it, as to &s;hew he perfectly agreed in his &s;entiments with the&s;e courts. But his &s;ituation in the jaws of a formidable enemy, and the experience of pa&s;&s;ed misfortunes, had rendered him &s;o weary, that he declined &s;igning the treaty; but &s;till, with the con&s;ent of the parties concerned, whom he fully con|vinced of his re&s;olution to co-operate in all their mea&s;ures. He de&s;ired and they agreed, that in the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms he &s;hould have a &s;hare in the &s;poil, on the footing of a treaty for the eventual portion, of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions made in the la&s;t war.

 <MILESTONE N="May 18, 1745."> 

 On the&s;e conditions the King of Poland without actu|ally &s;igning, was under&s;tood, and received as a party to the treaty of Peter&s;bourg.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e mea&s;ures, all &s;ort of means were employed to embroil the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs in the North, and particularly to render him per&s;onally odious to the Czarina. When their machinations had taken full ef|fect, and Ru&s;&s;ia was fixed in an unalterable enmity to that monarch, preparations of magazines and armies were made in Bohemia and Moravia; and the King of Poland, under pretence of a military amu&s;ement, drew together about 16000 men, with which he occupied the &s;trong and im|portant Po&s;t of Pirna. The Queen of Hungary &s;aw that &s;he
<PB N="11" REF="28">
&s;tood in need of yet &s;tronger &s;upports than the&s;e in the arduous bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had undertaken. She found that Great Britain, which had often done &s;o much for her di&s;tre&s;s, would do little for her ambition: &s;he therefore had recour&s;e to France, who joyfully accepted an alliance, that promi&s;ed to confound the whole Germanic body, concluded a treaty with the Empre&s;s at Ver&s;ailles the 1&s;t of May 1756, a re|markable aera in the political hi&s;tory of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret articles of the treaty of Peter&s;bourg, the fountain of the pre&s;ent troubles, and the &s;teps taken to put that treaty in execution, though formed and carried on with as much &s;ecrecy as earne&s;tne&s;s, could not e&s;cape the vigilance of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, who watched all their mo|tions, and had perfect intelligence of their mo&s;t hidden de|&s;igns. When, therefore, he perceived that by the breach between England and France, the Empre&s;s Queen would take advantage of the&s;e troubles to avail her&s;elf of her al|liances and her armament; he ordered his mini&s;ter at Vienna to demand a clear explication, and proper a&s;&s;urances con|cerning the preparations he &s;aw making: and receiving only a dry and equivocal an&s;wer, that the Empre&s;s had taken mea&s;ures for her own &s;ecurity and that of her allies and friends, the King believed him&s;elf no longer bound to pre|&s;erve any terms; a dangerous war was to be kept out of his own territories at any rate; and being always in perfect rea|dine&s;s for action, he fell upon Saxony with a con&s;iderable army.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;eemed only to demand a free pa&s;&s;age for his troops, and an ob&s;ervance of the neutrality profe&s;&s;ed by the King of Poland;

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 29."> 

 but as he had very good rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t &s;uch a neutrality, he demanded as a &s;ecurity, that the Saxon troops &s;hould quit the &s;trong po&s;t they occupied, and di&s;|per&s;e them&s;elve immediately. This demand was refu&s;ed, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in con&s;equence of that refu&s;al, immediately formed a &s;ort of blockade about the Saxon camp at Pirna, with a view to reduce it by famine, &s;ince its inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation rendered an attack unadvi&s;eable. There were in Bohemia two Au&s;trian armies under M. Brown and M. Picolomini; to keep them in awe, M. Schwerin had entered Bohemia from the county of Glatz; and M. Keith had penetrated into that kingdom on the &s;ide of Mi&s;nia. But the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, not entirely confiding in the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions? and &s;till apprehen&s;ive that M. Brown
<PB N="12" REF="29">
might be able to convey &s;ome relief to the Saxons, re&s;olv|ed to bring him to action, to the &s;ucce&s;s of which he knew his own pre&s;ence would greatly contribute. He therefore left the blockade of the Saxon army, joined his forces under Keith, and engaged the Au&s;trians at Lowo&s;itz. Here he obtained a victory,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 1."> 

 which though it was not undi&s;puted with regard to the field of battle, yet with regard to the con&s;equences it was as deci&s;ive as could be wi&s;hed. M. Brown found it impracticable to re|lieve the Saxons, notwith&s;tanding the judicious efforts he made for that purpo&s;e; and that Army, after a vain attempt to retire from their difficult po&s;t, which had one fault, that it was as difficult to leave it as to force it, were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. The King of Poland quitted his German dominions; and the Pru&s;&s;ians took up their winter quarters in Saxony, &s;eized upon the revenues, levied exorbitant contributions, and obliged the country to furni&s;h recruits. This unhappy people &s;aw their country exhau&s;t|ed, and forced to bear the burthen of a war again&s;t it&s;elf. It was then that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia con&s;ulting the rules of policy more than tho&s;e of politene&s;s, made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the archieves at Dre&s;den, in doing which &s;ome rough|ne&s;s was u&s;ed towards the Queen; but he made him&s;elf amends for the clamour indu&s;triou&s;ly rai&s;ed on this pretence, by acquiring the originals of the&s;e pieces, which evinced to the world the reality of the de&s;ign again&s;t him, and which therefore in a great mea&s;ure ju&s;tified the means he had taken to come at them, as well as the extraordinary &s;everities he u&s;ed towards the unfortunate Saxons.</P>

<P>WHILST the King of Pru&s;&s;ia pa&s;&s;ed the winter in the mo&s;t vigorous preparations for carrying on the war, his ally Great Britain pre&s;ented a very different face of things.

again&s;t tho&s;e who had acted weakly, but tho&s;e who had proved in&s;ufficiently for the lo&s;s of that important po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The public re&s;entment which at fir&s;t &s;eemed to have no other object than Byng, was &s;oon turned again&s;t the mini&s;try. The clamour in parliament was great; without doors it was exce&s;&s;ive. Addre&s;&s;es praying a &s;trict enquiry into the cau&s;e of our misfortunes, were pre&s;ented from all parts of the kingdom. The mini&s;try, notwith&s;tanding this general di&s;content, had a real &s;trength; and they might have &s;tood, had they agreed among&s;t them&s;elves. The commons could not be brought to any angry votes; and the re&s;ult of the enquiry into the lo&s;s of Minorca, was as favourable as they could have wi&s;hed. But Mr. F&mdash;x thought it not advi&s;eable to bear a large proportion of the odium cau&s;ed by coun&s;els, in which he had little &s;hare. Perhaps he thought this embarra&s;&s;ment, a &s;ituation not unfavourable to the arrangement he had always aimed at? he therefore &s;uddenly threw up an em|ployment, which he hoped to re&s;ume augmented with greater power.</P>
<P>On the removal of this principal prop, the whole &s;truc|ture of the mini&s;try fell to pieces. The D. of N. the Ld. Ch. the fir&s;t lord of the admiralty re&s;igned; and the chiefs of the party by who&s;e manoeuvres they were di&s;placed,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 4. 1756."> 

 naturally &s;ucceeded to the ma|nagement of affairs. They who had re&s;igned gave them no apparent oppo&s;ition in parliament; but whether it was, that the new mini&s;try were them|&s;elves too fre&s;h from oppo&s;ition, and &s;ome of them too full of the popular manners that introduced them to court to be perfectly agreeable in the clo&s;et, or that they had made their bottom too narrow, after holding their em|ployments for &s;ome months, to the great concern of the public, they in their turn were obliged to quit their po&s;ts.

 <MILESTONE N="April 5. 1757."> 

 Thus was the helm of government a &s;econd time abandoned. The ca&s;e of the King and the nation was at that juncture truly deplorable. We were without any ally who could do us the lea&s;t &s;ervice, engaged in a war hitherto un&s;ucce&s;sful, with the mo&s;t formidable power in Europe; we almo&s;t de&s;paired of our military virtue; public &s;pirit appeared utterly extingui&s;hed, whil&s;t the rage of faction burned with the utmo&s;t violence; our operations were totally &s;u&s;pend|ed:
<PB N="14" REF="31">
and having no mini&s;try e&s;tabli&s;hed, we had no plan to follow.</P>
<P>Three factions divided the ruling men of the nation, for the gro&s;s of the people &s;eemed to have no further views than a redre&s;s of their grievances, by whatever means that could be brought about; the fir&s;t of the&s;e factions was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who had grown to place and power, or had formed their connexions under the old mini&s;try. They were &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in the nation, and had undoubtedly the greate&s;t parliamentary intere&s;t. They had at the &s;ame time another intere&s;t hardly le&s;s con&s;iderable, that of the monied people; but in &s;ome points, and tho&s;e material too, they were weak. They were not at all popular; a matter of great con&s;i|deration in a government like ours; and they were &s;up|po&s;ed by the gro&s;s of the people, not to be under the direction of great political abilities.</P>
<P>The &s;econd faction, though not &s;u&s;pected of the want of &s;ufficient ability, was yet more unpopular than the former; they had not attempted to pre&s;erve even the ap|pearances e&s;&s;ential to popularity; and to them the more e&s;&s;ential, as their parliamentary &s;trength was, however re&s;pectable, much inferior to the fir&s;t. If their influence at one court was able to ballance that of the old mini&s;try, by means of a then powerful connexion, that very con|nection made them far wor&s;e at another court, and wor&s;e with the generality of the people, who entertained or pre|tended at lea&s;t to entertain, &s;u&s;picions of a nature the more dangerous, as they were only dropped in hints and whi&s;|pers, and never could come to a full and open explana|tion.</P>
<P>The third party, had little parliamentary and le&s;s court influence; but they had a prodigious popularity, which &s;upplied every other defect. The abilities of their leader were of the mo&s;t &s;hining kind; his application equal to his abilities; his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was confe&s;&s;ed by his ene|mies; and though it would have &s;hined in the days of he|roi&s;m, was now the more valued, and &s;et off to the greater advantage by the general &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which prevailed among the men of bu&s;ine&s;s. The nation repo&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect confidence in his integrity and love to his country. This party, con&s;cious where its &s;trength lay, cultivated with great care the popularity which was the ba&s;is of their

power; even perhaps &s;o as to impair on &s;ome occa&s;ion the dignity of government.</P>
<P>The&s;e three factions differed from each other extremely with regard to power, the grand object of all factions. But in the general &s;cheme of their politics, the two fir&s;t were pretty much agreed. Looking on France as the mo&s;t con|&s;tant and mo&s;t dangerous enemy of Great Britain, they dreaded the increa&s;e of her power and influence among the neighbouring nations as the greate&s;t of all evils. To pre|vent &s;o dangerous an aggrandi&s;ement, they thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a con&s;tant attention to the ballance of power, and to &s;eek our particular &s;afety and liberty in the general &s;afety and liberty of Europe. A clo&s;e connection was therefore to be kept up with the powers of the continent, not only by continual negotiati|ons, but by large &s;ub&s;idies, and even by a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with our troops if the occa&s;ion &s;hould require &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e, as well as to &s;ecure the more effectually our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, a con&s;iderable regular land force ought to be con&s;tantly maintained. Our navy, they thought, ought by no means to be neglected; but it was only to be cultivated and employed &s;ub&s;erviently to the more comprehen&s;ive continental &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e parties were far from being friends to arbitrary power, or in any &s;ort aver&s;e to parliaments; they loved the con&s;ti|tution; but they were for pre&s;erving the authority of go|vernment entire, and in its utmo&s;t lawful force. To make government more ea&s;y, knowing that many would di&s;turb it, from di&s;affection or di&s;gu&s;t, or mi&s;taken notions of liberty, they thought it ju&s;t to rule men by their intere&s;ts, if they could not by their virtues, and they had long been in the practice of procuring a majority in parliament, by the di&s;tribution of the numerous lucrative places and employments which our con&s;titution leaves in the di&s;po&s;al of the Crown. Several believed that no other method was practicable, con&s;idering the nature of mankind, and our particular form of government.</P>
<P>But the third and popular party, was influenced by different principles. They looked indeed on the power of France in the &s;ame light with the two former, and were of the &s;ame opinion concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting bounds to it. In the means of attaining this end they differed. Our &s;ituation they thought dictated a narrower,
<PB N="16" REF="33">
but a more natural, a &s;afer, and a le&s;s expen&s;ive plan of politics, than that which had been adopted by the other party. We ought never to forget, &s;aid they, that we are an i&s;land: and that this circum&s;tance, &s;o favourable both to our political and to our civil liberty, pre&s;cribes to us a conduct very different from that of any other nation. Our natural &s;trength is a maritime &s;trength, as trade is our natural employment; the&s;e mu&s;t always go hand in hand, and they mutually &s;upport each other. But, if turning our back to our real intere&s;ts, and abandoning our natural element, we enter that inextricable labyrinth of continental politics; if we make our&s;elves parties in every controver&s;y; if we exhau&s;t our wealth in purcha&s;ing the u&s;ele&s;s and precarious friend&s;hip of every petty prince or &s;tate; if we wa&s;te the blood of our people in all the quarrels that may ari&s;e on the continent; &s;o far from go|ing in the right way to reduce France, that we attack her on the &s;trong &s;ide, and only de&s;troy our&s;elves by our ill judg|ed efforts again&s;t the enemy. That we can have nothing to fear from the &s;uperiority of France on the continent, whil&s;t we pre&s;erve our &s;uperiority at &s;ea; that we can always cut the &s;inews of the enemy's &s;trength by de&s;troying their traffic; that to fear an inva&s;ion from a power weak in its marine, is the idle&s;t of all fears; that in ca&s;e an inva&s;ion were po&s;&s;ible, a well trained national militia, &s;upplying by their zeal the defects of their di&s;cipline, would prove our be&s;t protection; that a &s;tanding army is in whatever &s;hape dangerous to freedom; and that a government like ours, connected by its very e&s;&s;ence with the liberty of the &s;ub|ject, can never be in want of the &s;upports of de&s;potic power, As little is parliamentary influence nece&s;&s;ary. A govern|ment plea&s;ing to the people, as every good government mu&s;t be, can never be generally oppo&s;ed; and men need no bribes to per&s;uade them to their duty.</P>
<P>The&s;e notions, &s;o oppo&s;ite in their extreams, might be reconciled in a medium, and u&s;ed to temper each other. For as, on one hand, it would be very ab&s;urd to make no &s;ort of advantage of our in&s;ular &s;ituation, but to engage in all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the continent without re&s;erve, and to plunge our&s;elves into real evils out of a dread of po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chiefs; &s;o on the other hand, to think our&s;elves wholly unconcerned in the fortunes of our neighbours on the continent, or to think of aiding them in any ca&s;e, only
<PB N="17" REF="34">
by the way of diver&s;ion with our fleets, would be a way of proceeding, &s;till more extravagant than the former. If &s;uch notions were reduced to practice, we might &s;oon lo&s;e all tho&s;e advantages derived from a &s;ituation which we abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a temperament, could not be perceived during the ferment of that time, in which the&s;e topics were bandied to and fro with infinite heat. The re&s;ignation, or rather deprivation, of the popular mi|ni&s;try, only increa&s;ed their popularity, and the general di&s;content; the people could not believe that good mea|&s;ures could be pur&s;ued, when tho&s;e, in whom alone they confided, were not employed; almo&s;t all the corporations of the kingdom pre&s;ented the deprived mini&s;ters with their freedom, and addre&s;&s;ed them in the warme&s;t manner, te&s;ti|fying the mo&s;t intire approbation of their conduct, and the &s;incere&s;t concern to &s;ee them out of employment.</P>
<P>This conflict between an old e&s;tabli&s;hed intere&s;t, and the torrent of popularity, continued for a long time, and the nation was almo&s;t ruined by it. It is not ea&s;y, nor perhaps quite proper, to attempt to trace the &s;teps by which &s;o hap|py a coalition, as we have &s;een take place, was brought about. But it was formed in &s;uch manner, has held to|gether with &s;uch &s;olidity, and produced &s;uch excellent effects,

 as I believe the mo&s;t &s;anguine could not have hoped for at that time. Mr. P. was again re&s;tored to the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the D. of N. was placed at the head of the trea&s;ury, Mr. F. was appointed payma&s;ter of the forces. This ar|rangement, which gave very general &s;atisfaction, was how|ever di&s;liked by tho&s;e, whom their violent attachment to their party had in&s;pired with a narrow and exclu&s;ive &s;pirit. It was the be&s;t mea&s;ure, becau&s;e it was an healing mea|&s;ure; and it was little le&s;s than impo&s;&s;ible for any parti|cular party to carry on public bu&s;ine&s;s on its &s;ingle bot|tom.</P>
<P>It was high time that our dome&s;tic di&s;&s;entions &s;hould be compo&s;ed at la&s;t. From every quarter of the world, in which we had any concern,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 14. 1756."> 

 we heard of nothing but lo&s;&s;es and calamities. In America we lo&s;t the Fort of O&s;wego. That fort, &s;itua|ted at the mouth of the Onondaga river, commanded a commodious harbour on the Lake Ontario. It was built
<PB N="18" REF="35">
by General Shirley, and de&s;igned to cover the country of the Five Nations; to &s;ecure the Indian trade; to interrupt the communication between the French northern and &s;outhern e&s;tabli&s;hments; and to open a way to our arms to attack the forts of Frontenac and Niagara. For the&s;e purpo&s;es, &s;ome frigates had been fitted out for cruizing, and a number of boats prepared for the tran&s;portation of troops; but they all fell to the enemy with the fort, where 100 pieces of cannon were, and a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ion. 1600 men were made pri&s;oners of war. The place made but a trifling re&s;i&s;tance, &s;carce holding out three days; the attempts to relieve it were too late. The French demoli&s;hed the fort.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;&s;es were not confined to America. The E. India company received a blow, which would have &s;haken an e&s;tabli&s;hment of le&s;s &s;trength to its foundations. The news of the war between France and England had not yet reach|ed India, but a new and very formidable enemy was rai&s;ed up in that quarter. The Nabob of Bengal (the Nabobs are a &s;pecies of viceroys to the Grand Mogul, grown almo&s;t independent in their &s;everal provinces,) irritated at the protection given to one of his &s;ubjects in the Engli&s;h fort of Calcutta, and, as it is &s;aid, at the refu&s;al of &s;ome duties to which he claimed a right, levied a great army, and laid &s;iege to that place. The Governor, terrified by the numbers of the enemy, abandoned the fort with &s;eve|ral of the principal per&s;ons in the &s;ettlement, who &s;aved them&s;elves with their mo&s;t valuable effects on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;erted. Mr. Hollwel, the &s;econd in command, bravely held the place to the la&s;t extremity, with a few gallant friends, and the remains of a feeble garri&s;on. A very noble defence was in&s;ufficient to keep an untenable place, or to affect an ungenerous enemy. The fort was taken, and the garri&s;on being made pri&s;oners, were thru&s;t into a narrow dungeon.

 <MILESTONE N="June 26."> 

 Hollwel, with a few others, came out alive, to paint a &s;cene of the mo&s;t cruel di&s;tre&s;s which perhaps human nature ever &s;uffered. The Ea&s;t India company lo&s;t their principal &s;ettlement in Bengal, and a fort, which &s;ecured to them the mo&s;t valuable part of their trade.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHAT turn the Engli&s;h politics were like to take in the year 1759, &s;eemed for &s;ome time uncertain. The new mini&s;try did not &s;eem well e&s;tabli&s;hed; nor was it well known, whether they would pur&s;ue the plans and pre&s;erve the connections of the old. Abroad, every thing was prepared for opening the campaign with the utmo&s;t eclat. All Europe was in motion.</P>
<P>France, in order to demon&s;trate to the Queen of Hun|gary, the advantageous choice &s;he had made in connecting her&s;elf with the hou&s;e of Bourbon, formed two great ar|mies. The fir&s;t was compo&s;ed of near 80,000 men, the flower of the French troops, attended with a va&s;t artillery and commanded by M. d'Etrees, a General of the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation &s;he had in her &s;ervice. Under him &s;erved M. de Contades, M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all officers of high character, and all fit to com|mand in chief, if M. d'Etrees had not been appointed to that eminence. This formidable army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and marched by We&s;tphalia, in order to invade the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions in quality of allies to the Empre&s;s Queen, and guardians of the liberties of the Empire, and to no other intent, as it was pretended; but in reality, with a view to reduce Hanover al&s;o. They judged that their operations again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might be executed, and their &s;cheme to drive the King of England into &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions with regard to America, might be compleated by one and the &s;ame blow. The &s;econd army was com|manded

by the Prince de Soubi&s;e; it con&s;i&s;ted of about 25,000 men. This army was de&s;tined to &s;trengthen the Imperial army of execution; but before it had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, it made it&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cleves, Meurs and Gueldres, whil&s;t a detachment from d'Etrees's army &s;eized upon the town of Emden, and whatever el&s;e belonged to Pru&s;&s;ia in Ea&s;t Frie&s;land.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had entered Saxony in the beginning of the preceding &s;ummer, proce&s;s was com|menced again&s;t him in the Emperor's Aulic council, and before the diet of the Empire. It is not difficult to con|ceive how the affair mu&s;t have been decided; when tho&s;e who feared the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, believed they had a fair opportunity to reduce him: and when tho&s;e who feared the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, were, by that very fear, obliged to &s;up|port the power they dreaded: accu&s;tomed as they were to the influence of a family in which the Empire had &s;o long been in a manner hereditary; and over-awed by the appearance of a confederacy, the mo&s;t formidable the world had ever yet &s;een. Accordingly the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was condemned for contumacy: and the Fi&s;cal had orders to notify to him that he was put under the ban of the Empire, and adjudged fallen from all the dignities and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions which he held under it. The circles of the Em|pire were ordered to furni&s;h their contingents of men and money to put this &s;entence in execution; but the contin|gents were collected &s;lowly, the troops were badly compo|&s;ed, and probably this army had never been able to act, if it had not been for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance offered under the Prince de Soubi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians, who were principals in the quarrel, were not behind their auxiliaries in the greatne&s;s of their pre|parations; they made the mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts, by which they a&s;&s;embled a body of upwards of 100,000 men in Bohemia, and committed the command to Prince Charles of Lorrain, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by M. Brown. In the north all things threatened the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The Czarina true to her re&s;entments and her engagements, had &s;ent a body of 60,000 men commanded by M. Apraxin, who were in full march to invade the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, whil&s;t a &s;trong fleet was equip|ped in the Baltick, to co-operate with that army. Altho' the King of Sweden was allied in blood and inclination to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, yet the jealou&s;y which the Senate en|tertained
<PB N="21" REF="40">
of their &s;overeign; the hope of recovering their antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Pomerania by means of the pre&s;ent troubles, and in fine their old attachment to France, newly cemented by intrigues and &s;ub&s;idies, made their ill in|clinations to the cau&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia more than &s;u&s;picious. Hitherto indeed nothing more than the tendency of their councils was fully known. The Duke of Mecklenbourg took the &s;ame party, and agreed to join the Swedi&s;h army when it &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled, with 6000 men; a proceed|ing which he has &s;ince had rea&s;on to repent bitterly. Thus were the forces of five mighty &s;tates

, each of which had in their turn been a terror to all Europe, united to reduce the heir of the Marqui&s;&s;es of Brandenbourg; and in &s;uch a point of danger and glory, had the great and formidable abilities of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty placed him, with little, in compari&s;on, that could enable him to &s;u&s;tain the violence of &s;o many &s;hocks, except what tho&s;e abilities &s;upplied. But his a&s;toni&s;hing oeconomy, the incomparable order of his finances, the di&s;cipline of his armies beyond all prai&s;e, a &s;agacity that fore&s;aw every thing, a vigilance that attended every thing, a con&s;tancy that no labour could &s;ubdue, a courage that no danger could di&s;may, an intuitive glance that catches the deci&s;ive moment, all the&s;e &s;eemed to form a &s;ort of ballance to the va&s;t weight again&s;t him, turned the wi&s;hes of his friends into hopes, and made them depend upon re&s;ources that are not within the power of calcu|lation.</P>
<P>The only army that appeared in his favour was a body of between 30 and 40,000 Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, who with &s;ome reinforcements of his own troops, formed an army of ob&s;ervation, commanded by his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland; this army was po&s;ted on the We&s;er, to watch the motions of M. d'Etrees. The va&s;t and unwieldy body of the French, encumbered as the French armies always are by an immen&s;e baggage, and an innumerable multitude of mouths without hands, made a very &s;low progre&s;s through the rough and barren country that lies between the Rhine and the We&s;er. All the abili|ties of the French general were employed in finding &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence for his troops. His Royal Highne&s;s on the other hand, di&s;played great abilities in throwing all po&s;&s;ible im|pediments in his way. But when the&s;e impediments were removed by the &s;uperiority of numbers, the Hanoverian
<PB N="22" REF="41">
army gradually gave way, yielding to that &s;uperiority, and the French troops pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er without oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty being determined according to his maxim, to lay the cloth as from home as po&s;&s;ible; made his di&s;po&s;itions for carrying the war into Bohemia as &s;peedily as the &s;ea&s;on would admit. Three great bodies of his troops entered into that kingdom by three very different ways, but nearly at the &s;ame time. M. Schwerin penetrated into it from Sile&s;ia. The Prince of Bevern entered with the corps under his command from Lu&s;atia, and defeated as a preliminary to a more deci&s;ive victory, a body of 28,000 Au&s;trians who oppo|&s;ed him.

 <MILESTONE N="Apr. 21."> 

 The King him&s;elf prepared to enter Bohemia at a great di&s;tance from the corps com|manded by the&s;e Generals; and as he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to march towards Egra, the enemy imagined he intended to execute &s;ome de&s;ign di&s;tinct from the object of his other armies. With this idea they detached a body of 20,000 men, to ob&s;erve his motions. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia find|ing that this feint had all its effect, made a &s;udden and ma&s;terly movement to his left, by which he cut off all communication between that detachment and the main army of the Au&s;trians. Spirited with this advantage, he pu&s;hed onwards with the utmo&s;t rapidity to Prague, where he joined the corps under the prince of Bevern and M. Schwerin, who had advanced with inconceivable diligence to meet him. Never were operations executed with more judgment, celerity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian army was little &s;hort of 100,000 men, and the &s;ituation of their camp, fortified by every ad|vantage of nature,

 <MILESTONE N="May 6."> 

 and every contrivance of art, &s;uch as on common occa&s;ions might ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as impregnable; but the Pru&s;&s;ians, being near|ly as numerous as the enemy, in&s;pired by a &s;ociety of dan|ger with their King, and filled with that noble enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, whil&s;t it urges to daring enterpri&s;es, almo&s;t en&s;ures their &s;ucce&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed mora&s;&s;es, climed precipices, faced batteries, and after a bloody and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, totally defeated the Au&s;trians. They took their camp, military che&s;t, cannon, all the trophies of a complete victory. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the victors, as well as the vanqui&s;hed, was very great; but both &s;ides had yet a greater lo&s;s in
<PB N="23" REF="42">
the death of two of the be&s;t generals in Europe. M. Schwe|rin was killed at the age of eighty-two, with the colo|nels &s;tandard in his hand at the head of his regiment. M. Brown received a wound, which, from the chagrin he &s;uffered rather than from its own nature, proved mortal.</P>
<P>About 40,000 of the Au&s;trian army took refuge in Prague. The re&s;t fled different ways. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia lo&s;t no time to inve&s;t the place, and to cut off all &s;uccours. If on one hand &s;uch an immen&s;e garri&s;on made an attack unadvi&s;eable, on the other that formidable number it&s;elf &s;eemed to make the reduction of the place by famine the more certain. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia not relying &s;olely on this, prepared to bombard the town. On the 29th of May, at midnight, after a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm of rain and thunder, as if it were to di&s;play how much more ruinous the malice of men may be, than the greate&s;t terrors of na|ture, on the &s;ignal of a rocket, four batteries, which di&s;|charged every twenty-four hours two hundred and eighty-eight bombs, be&s;ides a va&s;t multitude of red hot balls, be|gan to pour de&s;truction on that unfortunate city, which was &s;oon in flames in every part. The garri&s;on made a vigo|rous defence, and one well conducted and de&s;perate &s;ally: but they were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. The principal magi&s;trates, burge&s;&s;es, and clergy, &s;eeing their city on the point of being reduced to an heap of rubbi&s;h, made the mo&s;t moving &s;upplications to the commander to li&s;ten to terms. The commander was deaf to their prayers. Twelve thou&s;and of the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s mouths were driven out of the city. The Pru&s;&s;ians forced them in again. The affairs of the empre&s;s &s;eemed verging to inevitable de&s;truction; a whole army was upon the point of &s;urrendering pri&s;oners of war; the capital of Bohemia on the point of being ta|ken, and with it all the re&s;t of that flouri&s;hing kingdom. The &s;anguine friends to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia began to com|pute the di&s;tance of Vienna.</P>
<P>In this de&s;perate &s;ituation of affairs, Leopold Count Daun entered on the &s;tage, and began to turn the fortune of the war. This General never had commanded in chief before; but he was formed, by a long cour&s;e of experience in various parts of Europe, under the greate&s;t Generals, and in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;cenes of actions. Though of a very noble family, he had, without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from court favour, ri&s;en in&s;en&s;ibly by the &s;low gradation of mere
<PB N="24" REF="43">
merit, with much e&s;teem and without any noi&s;e. This General arrived within a few miles of Prague, the day after the great battle. He collected the fugitive parties of the Au&s;trian army, and retired to a po&s;t of great &s;trength, from whence he fed the troops in Prague with hopes of re|lief. But as no man better under&s;tood the &s;uperiority of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops, and as he was &s;en&s;ible of the impre&s;&s;ion which the late defeat had left upon his men, he carefully avoided to precipitate matters by an ha&s;ty action. He knew that the &s;ituation he had cho&s;en would embarra&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ians; that a large party of their army mu&s;t be always employed to watch him; that this would weaken their ef|forts again&s;t the great body &s;hut up in Prague, whil&s;t his own forces gained time to recover their &s;pirits, and to in|crea&s;e in &s;trength by the daily &s;uccours, which his court exerted all their powers to &s;end him: with the&s;e ideas he waited in his entrenched camp at Colin, to act as events &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than Count Daun of the effects of this conduct. He determined at all adventures to di&s;lodge him from the po&s;t he held; but whether it was that the King feared to weaken his army, which had actually an army to be&s;iege, or whether he was blinded by a train of uniform &s;ucce&s;s, which made him believe his arms irre&s;i&s;table under every di&s;advantage, or whatever were his motives or nece&s;&s;ities, the whole army employed in this undertaking, including the Prince of Bevern's corps, did not exceed 32,000 men, cavalry and infantry; and with the&s;e he was to attack 60,000 men, in one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ituations which could be cho&s;en,

 <MILESTONE N="June 18."> 

 and defended by a va&s;t train of artillery. Whatever the mo&s;t impetuous and well regula|ted courage, whatever an ardor in&s;pired by the remem|brance of &s;o many victories could do towards overcoming every kind of di&s;advantage, was done by the Pru&s;&s;ians on this occa&s;ion. They returned to the attack &s;even times: in none of their victorious battles had their bravery been more con&s;picuous. Both the King's brothers were in the field; and they did every thing that could be expected from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's brothers. The King him&s;elf at the head of his cavalry, made one furious and concluding charge. Every thing was tried, and every thing was un|&s;ucce&s;sful. The want of a &s;ufficiently numerous infantry,
<PB N="25" REF="44">
in a ground where his cavalry could not &s;upport them, the want of an equal artillery, the advantageous &s;ituation of the enemy, their numbers, their bravery, their General, obli|ged the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to quit the field. What his lo&s;s was is not &s;o certain; it wa s undoubtedly great in the ac|tion, but &s;till greater by de&s;ertions, and the innumerable ill con&s;equences that follow a defeat.</P>
<P>Though the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was defeated in this battle, and though he brought on his defeat in a great mea&s;ure, by &s;ome errors of his own, yet whatever &s;mall blemi&s;h his military &s;kill might have &s;uffered, his reputation was rai&s;ed higher than ever, in the opinion of all judicious men, by the noble and candid manner in which he acknowledged his mi&s;take, by the firmne&s;s with which he bore his mi&s;|fortune, and by tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trokes of genius and heroi&s;m, by which he retrived his lo&s;s. The &s;miles of fortune make conquerors; it is her malice which di&s;covers heroes.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEVER was the old ob&s;ervation, <HI>une bataille perdue a un mauvais <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u,</HI> more verified than in the con&s;e|quences of the unfortunate battle of Colin. Though the King retired unpur&s;ued by his enemies, he was obliged to rejoin his own army before Prague without delay, and to rai&s;e the blockade of that place. The impri&s;oned Au&s;trians with joy received Count Daun their deliverer, and their united forces became greatly &s;uperior to the Pru&s;&s;ians. The King was in a &s;hort time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in Saxony. The Au&s;trians hara&s;&s;ed him as much as po&s;&s;ible; but their armies, notwith&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority, were not in a condition from their late &s;ufferings to make any deci&s;ive attempt upon him, as the
<PB N="26" REF="45">
frontiers of Saxony abound with &s;ituations ea&s;ily de|fended.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's misfortunes now poured in upon him at once, and from every quarter. The army com|manded by the Duke of Cumberland, who continually re|tired before the French, after they had pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, came however to a re&s;olution to make a &s;tand at Ha&s;ten|beck, within a few Miles of Hammelen, where it was judged that the &s;uperior numbers of the enemy might be the lea&s;t prejudicial; but notwith&s;tanding the advantages of the &s;ituation, the bravery of the Hanoverians, and the conduct of the Duke, the allied army was driven from the field of battle,

 <MILESTONE N="July 25."> 

 and retreated towards Stade. By taking this route his Royal Highne&s;s was driven into a &s;ort of <HI>cul de &s;ac.</HI> Unable by his &s;ituation to retire, or by his &s;trength to advance, he was compelled to &s;ign the remarkable capitulation of Clo&s;ter-&s;even,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 7."> 

 by which 38,000 Hanoverians laid down their arms, and were di&s;per&s;ed into different quarters of cantonment. The French army had a little before this changed its commander. D'Etrees, the favourite of all the military men, was removed from the command, which was conferred on the Duke de Rich|lieu, who excelled him and all mankind in the profe&s;&s;ion of a courtier. The Hanoverians were now quite &s;ubdued, and all the French force, let loo&s;e by this treaty, was ready to fall in upon the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions.</P>
<P>An enterprize was concerted in England again&s;t the coa&s;t of France, to make a diver&s;ion in his favour, by drawing a part of the French army to the defence of their own country. England propo&s;ed to compa&s;s another great de|&s;ign, and which &s;he had equally at heart, by the expedi|tion, which was to give an effectual blow to the marine of France. The de&s;tination of this armament was kept a pro|found &s;ecret, and whil&s;t it excerci&s;ed the penetration of all the politicians of Europe, it filled France with the mo&s;t &s;erious alarms. The Engli&s;h Fleet at la&s;t appeared before Rochfort. Some time was &s;pent before it could be re&s;olved what plan was to be followed in the attack;

 <MILESTONE N="Sep. 21."> 

 at la&s;t it was re&s;olved to &s;ecure the &s;mall i&s;le of Aix, from whence &s;ome ob&s;truction was apprehended to their landing. The i&s;land was &s;oon reduced; but as a good deal of time was con&s;umed in the&s;e deliberations and
<PB N="27" REF="46">
actions, the militia of the country had time to gather, and there was an appearance of two camps on the &s;hore. The commanders now took into con&s;ideration the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t, the danger of landing, the time the enemy had to put the place in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence, as might make any &s;udden attempt, or <HI>coup de main,</HI> un&s;ucce&s;sful: in con&s;equence of the&s;e deliberations, they unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved to return without making any attempt. The di&s;appointment of the nation was equal to the &s;anguine hopes we had conceived;

 <MILESTONE N="Sep. 29."> 

 nothing could exceed the general di&s;content. The military men blamed the plan of the expedition. The Mini&s;ters, and with them the public voice, exclaimed at the execution. A <HI>court of enquiry,</HI> of officers of reputation, cen&s;ured the commander; a <HI>court martial,</HI> of officers of reputation, acquitted him. The expedition &s;erved only in England to increa&s;e and imbitter our di&s;&s;entions, and to turn our at|tention to vain di&s;putes. It did nothing towards relieving the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, who had made for a long time a dilatory march and &s;eemed uncertain of their own re&s;olution, all at once ha&s;tened their motions. They entered the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia under M. Apraxin and General Fermer, and marked their progre&s;s by a thou&s;and inhuman cruelties. A large body of Au&s;trians entered Sile&s;ia, and penetrated as far as Bre&s;lau. Then they made a turn backwards, and laid &s;iege to the important fortre&s;s of Schweidnitz, ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the key of that dutchy, which was the cau&s;e of the war. Another body entered Lu&s;atia, and made them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of Zittau. Twenty-two thou&s;and Swedes pierced into the Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and laid the whole country under contributions. Richlieu, freed from all oppo&s;ition on the &s;ide of Hanover, made his way into Halber&s;tad, and the old marche of Brandenburgh, fir&s;t exacting contributions, and then plun|dering the towns. The army of the Empire, reinforced by that of the Prince de Soubi&s;e, after many delays, was at la&s;t on full march to enter Saxony; this left the Au&s;trians at liberty to turn the greate&s;t part of their forces to the reduc|tion of Sile&s;ia. General Haddick pierced through Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ed by the Pru&s;&s;ian armies, and, &s;uddenly pre&s;enting him&s;elf before the gates of Berlin, laid the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's capital under contribution; and though he retired on the
<PB N="28" REF="47">
approach of a body of Pru&s;&s;ians, yet he &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former po&s;t, in order to interrupt the communica|tion of the King with Sile&s;ia. The fate which &s;eemed to have threatened the Empre&s;s &s;ome months ago, was now looked upon as the certain lot of her antagoni&s;t. All his endeavours to retrieve his affairs had hitherto been equally brave and un&s;ucce&s;sful. General Lehwald had orders at any hazard to engage the Ru&s;&s;ians: with thirty thou&s;and he attacked double that number &s;trongly entrenched, at a place called Norkitten; but after &s;everal of tho&s;e wonderful efforts,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 30."> 

 which the Pru&s;&s;ians alone knew how to make, he was compelled to retire; but he retired in excellent order, without being pur&s;ued, having killed five times more of the enemy, than he had lo&s;t of his own men, and more formidable after his defeat, than the Ru&s;&s;ians after their victory. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia exerted him&s;elf upon every &s;ide; his enemies almo&s;t always fled before him; but whil&s;t he pur&s;ued one body, another gained in &s;ome other part upon him, and the winter came on fa&s;t, as his &s;trength decayed, and his adver&s;aries multi|plied from every quarter. The following letter which ap|peared in the public papers about this time, paints the con|dition of that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed monarch, in &s;o full a manner, that I &s;hall attempt no other de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>"Many per&s;ons, who &s;aw the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he pa&s;&s;ed lately through Leip&s;ic, cannot expre&s;s how much he is altered. They &s;ay he is &s;o much worn away, that they &s;carce knew him. This, indeed, is not to be won|dered at; he hath not a body of iron, like Charles XII. and he endures as great fatigues as he did. He is as much on hor&s;eback as Charles was, and often lies upon the ground. His inward &s;ufferings cannot be le&s;s than his out|ward: let us ca&s;t our eyes on a map of the Pru&s;&s;ian domi|nions; and mea&s;ure what he hath left of the many fair po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions he had in the month of April la&s;t, of which a &s;pace of &s;even months hath &s;tript him. Whence can he have men? he is &s;hut out from the Empire; and from whence can he draw money? the dutchy of Guelders, the dutchy of Cleves, the principality of Moers, the county of Lin|gen, the county of Lip&s;tadt, the principality of Minden, Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, Embden, and its infant company, part of the archbi&s;hoprick of Magdeburgh, &s;ome other parts of the marche, Ducal Pomerania, a great part of Sile&s;ia, a

great part of the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, Berlin it&s;elf, almo&s;t all his dominions, in &s;hort, are either taken from him, or laid under contribution, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies, who collect the public revenues, fatten on the contributions, and with the money which they draw from the electorate of Hanover, and other conque&s;ts defray the expences of the war. This picture certainly differs greatly from that which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might have &s;ketched out, the day he took arms to enter Saxony. Add to this the Duke of Cum|berland's convention, which deprived him of all his allies, and left him without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever, excepting four or five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which the Briti&s;h parliament may give him.

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Battle of Ro&s;bach, Schwaidnitz taken by the Au&s;trians. Prince of Bevern attacked in his entrenchments. Bre&s;lau taken by the Au&s;trians. King of Pru&s;&s;ia marches to Sile&s;ia. The battle of Li&s;&s;a. Bre&s;lau retaken. Au&s;tri|ans driven out of Sile&s;ia.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS was the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;ituation, when the will of Providence, and his own wonderful abilities, as wonderfully changed the &s;cene. His maje&s;ty deferred to bring on a deci&s;ive action, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as his affairs were, until the approach of winter; had he marched to attack the Imperial army, whil&s;t it was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, he mu&s;t either have left Saxony expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the Au&s;trian parties, or have greatly weakened his own forces employed in the principal action. He therefore &s;uf|fered the army of the Empire to advance to the frontiers of Mi&s;nia, and even to threaten the &s;iege of Leip&s;ic, be|fore he began to act again&s;t them: he however moved to|wards them, leaving an army in Lu&s;atia to ob&s;erve the Au&s;trians. On his fir&s;t motions, the enemy retired with precipitation. But when they had reinforced them&s;elves with numbers and courage &s;ufficient to per&s;uade them to advance, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his turn retired. His re|&s;olution &s;eemed to have been to fight as near Mi&s;nia as po&s;|&s;ible, and as deep in the winter, as he conveniently might, for if he &s;hould have the good fortune to &s;ucceed again&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="49">
the Imperial army, &s;uch a blow, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, would effectually di&s;able them from acting any thing to his preju|dice, for that year at lea&s;t; but if, on the contrary, he &s;hould fail, Saxony was at hand, in which it would prove difficult for the enemy to make any impre&s;&s;ion whil&s;t the winter continued. As for the time to be lo&s;t by following this plan, and the advantage it would afford the Au&s;trians in their de&s;igns on Sile&s;ia, they were not to be compared with the advantages which the King received from it. He knew that Schweidnitz was &s;trong, and excellently provi|ded; the prince of Bevern was &s;trongly po&s;ted near it to ob&s;truct the enemy's operations; the winter would lean heavier on the be&s;iegers; and on the whole, he had rea&s;on to tru&s;t that his troops, animated by his own pre&s;ence and example, would prove far &s;uperior to the enemy, in endu|ring all the hard&s;hips of a winter campaign.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;pent in various movements, between the allied army of the Imperiali&s;ts and French on one &s;ide, and the Pru&s;&s;ians on the other, the King re&s;olved to give battle to his enemies, who were now advanced to the con|fines of Mi&s;nia. On the 24th of October, the King had taken his re&s;olution; at that time his army happened to be divided into &s;everal corps, &s;ome of them at a di&s;tance of no le&s;s than twenty leagues a&s;under; yet &s;uch were the &s;pirit and excellent di&s;po&s;itions of the Pru&s;&s;ians, that the junction of all the&s;e corps were fully effected on the 27th, and the King advanced towards the enemy. The enemy fell back at his approach, and repa&s;&s;ed the Sala; they were followed clo&s;e.

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 5."> 

 The two armies met near the village of Ro&s;bach.</P>
<P>The united army, commanded by the prince of Saxe Hilburghau&s;en and the prince of Soubi&s;e, was 50,000 men compleat. But the troops of the Circles were new rai&s;ed, and many of them not well affected to the &s;ervice, nor to their French allies. The Pru&s;&s;ians did not amount to 25,000; but then they were Pru&s;&s;ians, and led on by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. As &s;oon as the armies were formed, and the battle going to begin, which was to decide the fate of &s;o many nations, and to determine between force and virtue, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia addre&s;&s;ed his troops nearly in the fol|lowing words.</P>
<P><Q>My dear friends, the hour is come, in which all that is, and all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon
<PB N="31" REF="50">
the &s;words which are now drawn for the battle. Time permits me to &s;ay but little; nor is there occa&s;ion to &s;ay much. You know that there is no labour, no hun|ger, no cold, no watching, no danger that I have not &s;hared with you hitherto; and you now &s;ee me ready to lay down my life with you, and for you. All I a&s;k, is the &s;ame pledge of fidelity and affection that I give. And let me add, not as an incitement to your courage, but as a te&s;timony of my own gratitude, that from this hour, until you go into quarters, your pay &s;hall be double. Acquit your&s;elves like men, and put your con|fidence in God.</Q>
The effect of this &s;peech was &s;uch as cannot be de&s;cribed. The general emotion bur&s;t in an uni|ver&s;al &s;hout, and the looks and demeanor of the men were animated to a &s;ort of heroic phren&s;y. In this di&s;po&s;ition, which progno&s;ticated the &s;ucce&s;s, engagement began.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the action, the French cavalry came on with great &s;pirit, but they were repul&s;ed; &s;ome regi|ments having gained an eminence, defended them&s;elves bravely, but in the end they were totally routed. The in|fantry, both French and Imperiali&s;ts, made but a faint re|&s;i&s;tance. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia in per&s;on, expo&s;ed to the hotte&s;t fire, led on his troops; the enemy gave way in every part; they were &s;eized with a panic, and fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. They left 3000 men dead on the field of battle; 63 pieces of cannon, and many colours. Eight French generals, 250 officers of different ranks, and 6000 private men were taken. Night alone &s;aved from total de&s;truction the &s;cattered remains of an army that in the morning was &s;o numerous and &s;o formidable.</P>
<P>I have not undertaken on this, nor &s;hall I undertake upon any other occa&s;ion, in the&s;e preliminary chapters, to enter into the detail of all the various manoeuvres of every battle; they are matters little under&s;tood by, and little intere&s;ting to, the generality of readers. Be&s;ides, the accounts are &s;ometimes inaccurate, and &s;eldom or never con&s;i&s;tent with each other.</P>
<P>The glorious &s;ucce&s;s of the battle of Ro&s;bach, was &s;uch as hardly wanted to be improved; the enemy was left to|tally incapable of action. The King was &s;et free on that &s;ide; but it was a freedom which gave him no re&s;pite from his labours; it only gave him an opportunity of undergo|ing
<PB N="32" REF="51">
new labours in another part. The Au&s;trians had a va&s;t force, and had now begun to make a proportionable progre&s;s in Sile&s;ia. The dependance which the King had upon the fidelity of his Generals there, &s;eemed &s;haken by &s;omething which then appeared, and &s;till &s;eems ambiguous in their conduct. The Au&s;trians after a &s;iege from the 27th of October to the 11th of November, carried on under infinite difficulties and with a prodigious lo&s;s, had reduced Schweidnitz, and obliged the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on of 4000 men to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. Soon after, as they had intelligence of the victory of Ro&s;bach, and knew that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was on full march to the relief of Sile&s;ia, the Au&s;trians re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time to attack the prince of Bevern in his &s;trong camp under the walls of Bre&s;lau. A treble &s;uperiority incited them to this attempt. They attacked the prince's army with great re&s;o|lution, and their attack was &s;u&s;tained with amaz|ing intrepidity.

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 22."> 

 The &s;laughter of the Au&s;trians was prodigious. A great part of their army had retired from the field of battle, and the re&s;t were preparing to retire; when all at once the Pru&s;&s;ian Generals unexpect|edly took the &s;ame re&s;olution. A part of their army had &s;uffered a great deal in the engagement. They became apprehen&s;ive of a total defeat, in ca&s;e their intrenchments &s;hould be forced in any part, With the&s;e ideas they re|treated from the &s;trong po&s;t they occupied, and retired be|hind the Oder.. The Au&s;trians returning, with a&s;toni&s;h|ment &s;aw them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the field of battle, which they had but ju&s;t been obliged to relinqui&s;h. What is re|markable, and what gave ri&s;e to many conjectures, the Prince of Bevern going to reconnoitre without e&s;cort, and attended only by a groom, was taken two days after the battle by an advanced party of Croats, a &s;mall body of whom had cro&s;&s;ed the Oder.</P>
<P>This advantage, though dearly bought, was immediately followed with many others. Bre&s;lau, the capital of Sile&s;ia,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 24."> 

 immediately &s;urrendered, where, as well as at Schweidnitz, they found va&s;t &s;tores of provi&s;ion, ammunition and money. All Sile&s;ia was on the point of falling into their hands. Fortune &s;eems every where to have thrown the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs into di&s;traction, in order to rai&s;e, and as it were, to round his glory in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing them; and to have been even &s;o jealous of his ho|nour
<PB N="33" REF="52">
as not to permit his own excellent generals and incom|parable troops to triumph any where but in his own pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>The King immediately after the battle of Ro&s;bach, with tho&s;e troops which he had a few days before collected from places an hundred miles di&s;tant from each other, began a march of upwards of two hundred more, and led them from engaging one &s;uperior army, to engage another &s;till more &s;uperior; from danger to hard&s;hip, and from hard|&s;hip to renewed danger. In the mo&s;t rapid march he pa&s;&s;ed through Thuringia, through Mi&s;nia, through Lu&s;atia, in &s;pite of the efforts of the Generals Haddick and Mar&s;hal, who were po&s;ted in Lu&s;atia to ob&s;truct him; and entering Sile&s;ia arrived the 2d of December at Parchwitz upon the Oder. Here he was joined by the Prince of Bevern's corps who cro&s;&s;ed that river to meet him.</P>
<P>About this time an incident happened which was very remarkable; one of the&s;e agreeable adventures that relieve the mind amid&s;t the perpetual horror that attends a narra|tive of battles and blood&s;hed. The garri&s;on of Schweid|nitz had &s;een, with the greate&s;t reluctance, the capitulation which bound their hands from the Service of their King and Country. Whil&s;t the Au&s;trians were conducting them to pri&s;on, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their ma&s;ter had gained at Ro&s;bach; animated with this news, they unanimou&s;ly ro&s;e upon the e&s;corte which con|ducted them, and which happened not to be very &s;trong, and entirely di&s;per&s;ed it. Thus freed, they marched on not very certain of their way, in hope to rejoin &s;ome corps of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops. The &s;ame fortune which freed them, led them directly to the army commanded by the King him&s;elf, which was ha&s;tening to their relief. Great was the joy on both &s;ides at this unexpected meeting, for the pri&s;oners had heard nothing of his Maje&s;ty's march. This little incident, whil&s;t it added a con&s;iderable &s;trength to the army, added likewi&s;e to its &s;pirit, and &s;eemed an happy omen of &s;ucce&s;s in the future engagement.</P>
<P>As his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty approached to Bre&s;lau, the Au&s;|trians confiding in their &s;uperiority, abandoned their &s;trong camp (the &s;ame which had been occupied by the Prince of Bevern) and re&s;olved to give the King battle. He was marching with the utmo&s;t diligence not to di&s;ap|point them;

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 5."> 

 and they met near the village of
<PB N="34" REF="53">
Leuthen. The ground which the Au&s;trians occupied was very advantageous, and every advantage of the &s;ituation was improved to the utmo&s;t, by the diligence and &s;kill of Count Daun; who remembring that he was the only Ge|neral who had ever carried the field from the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, knew better than any body how difficult it was to ob|tain &s;uch a victory. All the di&s;po&s;itions were made ac|cordingly; the ground they occupied was a plain, except that in &s;ome part it had &s;mall eminences; the&s;e they &s;ur|rounded with artillery; the ground was al&s;o inter&s;per&s;ed with thickets, which they &s;ought to turn to their advantage. On their right and left were hills on which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in their front was inter|&s;ected by many cau&s;eways; and to make the whole more impracticable, the Au&s;trians had felled a va&s;t many trees, and &s;cattered them in the way. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not terrified with this &s;ituation, nor with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that above 70,000 excellent troops, commanded by Count Daun, were &s;o po&s;ted. The Pru&s;&s;ians, who did not ex|ceed, as it is &s;aid, 36,000 men, attacked them with their u&s;ual re&s;olution. It was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, at the begin|ning of the engagement, for the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e to act, on account of the impediments we have ju&s;t mentioned, but a mo&s;t judicious di&s;po&s;ition of the King him&s;elf overcame that di&s;advantage; he had in his fir&s;t di&s;po&s;itions placed four batallions behind the cavalry of his right wing, fore|&s;eeing that General Nada&s;ti, who was placed with a corps de re&s;erve on the enemies left, de&s;igned to take him in flank. It happened as he had fore&s;een; that General's hor&s;e attacked the King's right wing with great fury; but he was received with &s;o &s;evere a fire from the four battali|ons, that he was obliged to retire in di&s;order. Then the King's flank well covered and &s;upported, was enabled to act with &s;uch order and vigour, that the enemy's right was obliged to give way. The Pru&s;&s;ian artillery, which was incomparably &s;erved, and &s;ilenced that of the enemy, con|curring to maintain the King's infantry, and to enable them to act in grounds where their hor&s;e could give them but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Au&s;trians made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance during the whole battle. The panic of the enemy did not here, as at Ro&s;bach, do half the bu&s;ine&s;s; every foot of ground was well di&s;puted. The Au&s;trians rallied all their forces about Leuthen, which was defended upon all &s;ides
<PB N="35" REF="54">
with intrenchments and redoubts. After reiterated attacks made with the utmo&s;t impetuo&s;ity, and &s;u&s;tained with great firmne&s;s, the Pru&s;&s;ians ma&s;tered the po&s;t; then the Au&s;tri|ans fled on all parts; they were entirely routed. The King pur&s;ued them to Li&s;&s;a. 6000 of the Au&s;trians were &s;lain, 15,000 were made pri&s;oners; and an immen&s;e artil|lery, upwards of 200 pieces of cannon were taken.</P>
<P>This great and deci&s;ive action was fought on the very &s;ame day of the next month after the no le&s;s important and deci&s;ive battle of Ro&s;bach. The con&s;equences that follow|ed the action of Leuthen, declared the entirene&s;s of the victory. Notwith&s;tanding the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau was immediately undertaken, and pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch &s;pirit, that by the 29th of December it &s;urrendered; and with it &s;urrendered the garri&s;on of 13,000 men pri&s;o|ners of war; the blockade of Schweidnitz was formed as clo&s;ely as the inclemency of the winter would permit; whil&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian parties not only re-po&s;&s;es&s;ed tho&s;e parts of Sile&s;ia which belonged to the King, but penetrating into the Au&s;trian divi&s;ion, reduced Jagerndorf, Troppau, and Tet&s;chen, and left to the Empre&s;s Queen, except a forlorn garri&s;on in Schweidnitz, no &s;ort of footing in that country, in which a few days before &s;he reckoned her dominion per|fectly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ians and Swedes retire. Hanoverians re&s;ume their arms. Cruelty of the French. Condition of their army. Ca&s;tle of Harburg be&s;ieged. Re-capitulation of the events of the year <HI>1757.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the misfortunes of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, after the battle of Colin, came on him all at once, &s;o his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, after his victories at Ro&s;bach and Li&s;&s;a, flowed upon him all at once likewi&s;e, and in a full tide. The Ru&s;&s;ians, though they had repul&s;ed General Lehwald, &s;uffered &s;o much in that action, and their barbarous method of mak|ing war had &s;o de&s;troyed the country, that they &s;eemed to them&s;elves to have no way of &s;afety left but in retiring out of the Pru&s;&s;ian territories. This extraordinary retreat of &s;o great an army, and &s;o lately victorious, and &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good &s;ea-port in the country, could &s;carcely be ac|counted
<PB N="36" REF="55">
for on tho&s;e motives we have a&s;&s;igned, and a&s;toni&s;hed all Europe, whil&s;t it left Gen. Lehwald at liberty to turn his arms into Pomerania again&s;t the Swedes. The Swedes on this occa&s;ion did nothing worthy of their ancient military fame; but every where retiring, left the Pru&s;&s;ians an ea&s;y conque&s;t, not only of the Pru&s;&s;ian but of every part of the Swedi&s;h Pomerania, excepting the port of Stral&s;und; they left their allies of Mecklenbourg quite expo&s;ed to all the re|&s;entment of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who cha&s;ti&s;ed them with the mo&s;t &s;evere contributions and levies. The French, who had been ravaging the old marche of Brandenburg, evacuated that country immediately after the battle of Ro&s;|bach. But one of the greate&s;t revolutions of fortune in the war, and one of the mo&s;t glorious and important con&s;e|quences of that victory, was, that the Hanoverian troops were enabled to re&s;ume their arms.</P>
<P>From the moment the capitulation of Clo&s;ter-&s;even was &s;igned, the Duke the Richlieu, who came to the command only to reap the advantages, and &s;ully the honour of an|other's conque&s;t, &s;eemed to think of nothing but how to re|pair, from the plunder of the unhappy Hanoverians, the fortune which he had &s;hattered by a thou&s;and vices. The mo&s;t exorbitant contributions were levied with the mo&s;t in|flexible &s;everity; every exaction, which was &s;ubmitted to, only produced a new one &s;till more extravagant; and all the orderly methods of plunder did not exempt them from the pillage, licenciou&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;olence of the French &s;ol|diery. However, in ju&s;tice to merit, we mu&s;t exempt from this general charge the conduct of the duke de Randan, Governor of Hanover for the French; who &s;aved the ca|pital of the Electorate from utter ruin by the &s;trictne&s;s of his di&s;cipline, by the prudence, the ju&s;tice and moderation of all his conduct; a conduct which does more real honour to his name, than the mo&s;t &s;plendid victories.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu's rapaciou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t they leaned &s;o heavily on the conquered people, did the conquering army no kind of &s;ervice. Intent only on plunder, which he did not confine to the enemy, he relaxed every part of military di&s;cipline; and that numerous army which M. d'Etrees had &s;u&s;tained, and brought in health and &s;pirits through the di&s;mal de&s;arts of We&s;tphalia, under all the oppo&s;ition of a &s;kilful adver&s;ary, were now, in full peace, in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a conquered and plentiful country,
<PB N="37" REF="56">
reduced in their numbers, decayed in their health, and their &s;pirits, without cloaths, without &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, without order, without arms. In this condition they began at la&s;t to per|ceive that the Hanoverians, with the yoke of the capitula|tion about their necks, were &s;till formidable. As they had broke almo&s;t every article of that treaty, they made no &s;cru|ple to add another breach in order to &s;ecure them in all the re&s;t. They attempted actually to take their arms from the Hanoverian and He&s;&s;ian troops. The&s;e gallant troops, who had with a &s;ilent grief and indignation &s;een the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their ruined country, were ravi&s;hed to find that the victory at Ro&s;bach encouraged their &s;overeign to re&s;ent at la&s;t this and all the other indignities they had &s;uffered. They began to collect and to act, and under the command of the gallant Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, reinforced with a body of Pru&s;&s;ian troops, they broke from their confinement. They reduced the town of Harburg, and laid clo&s;e &s;iege to the ca&s;tle, which it mu&s;t be owned was defended very bravely. In all other re&s;pects the French did not &s;eem in a condition to maintain their ground any where. Tho&s;e troops, which a few months before had &s;o &s;ubmitted as to make it nece&s;|&s;ary to declare that they were <HI>not pri&s;oners of war,</HI> in order to explain their condition, were now on the point of pu&s;h|ing their adver&s;aries to almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;treights. Such was the force of French military di&s;cipline, and &s;uch the triumphs of Voltaire's hero.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia now &s;aw the full effect of his coun|&s;els and his labours. His dominions were freed; his allies were enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and his enemies defeated, broken, and flying every where before him. In what light po&s;terity will view the&s;e things is uncertain; we, under who&s;e eyes, as we may &s;ay, they were atchieved, &s;carcely believed what we had &s;een. And perhaps in all the records of time, the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle year, on the &s;cene of a &s;ingle country, never contained &s;o many &s;triking events, never di&s;played &s;o many revolutions of fortune; revolutiens not only beyond what might have been expected, but far beyond what the mo&s;t &s;agacious fore&s;ight, rea&s;oning from experience, and the nature of things, could po&s;&s;ibly have imagined. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia at fir&s;t triumphant: the whole power of the Au|&s;trians totally defeated; their hopes utterly ruined: then their affairs &s;uddenly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, their armies victorious, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his turn hurled down; defeated;
<PB N="38" REF="57">
abandoned by his allies; &s;urrounded by his enemies; on the very edge of de&s;pair: then all at once rai&s;ed beyond all hope, he &s;ees the united Au&s;trian, Imperial, and French power levelled with the ground; 40,000 Hanoverians, a whole army, &s;ubmit to 80,000 French, and are only <HI>not</HI> pri|&s;oners of war. The French are peacable ma&s;ters of all the country between the We&s;er and the Elbe: anon, the&s;e &s;ub|dued Hanoverians re&s;ume their arms; they recover their country, and the French in a little time think them&s;elves not &s;ecure to the ea&s;tward of the Rhine. 500,000 men in action. Six pitched battles fought. Three great armies annihilated. The French army reduced and vanqui&s;hed without fighting. The Ru&s;&s;ians victorious, and flying as if they had been vanqui&s;hed. A confederacy, not of &s;amller potentates to humble one great power, but of five the greate&s;t powers on earth to reduce one &s;mall potentate; all the force of the&s;e powers exerted and baffled. It happened as we have related; and it is not the hi&s;tory of a century, but of a &s;ingle campaign.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WITH regard to the part we had in the tran&s;actions of this year, though it was not &s;o full of &s;triking events, nor does it afford &s;uch a &s;plendid &s;ubject for narra|tive, yet it is as interre&s;ting to an Engli&s;h reader, and may perhaps prove more in&s;tructive; as it &s;hews us in &s;o &s;trong a light, the mi&s;erable con&s;equences of our political divi&s;ions, which produced a general un&s;teadine&s;s in all out pur&s;uits, and infu&s;ed a langour and inactivity into all our military ope|rations. For, whil&s;t our commanders abroad knew not who were to reward their &s;ervices or puni&s;h their neglects, and were not a&s;&s;ured in what light even the be&s;t of their actions would be con&s;idered, (having rea&s;on to apprehend that they might not be judged of as they were in them&s;elves, but as their appearances might an&s;wer the end of &s;ome ruling fac|tion;)
<PB N="39" REF="58">
they naturally wanted that firmne&s;s and that enter|prizing re&s;olution, without which the be&s;t capacity, and in|tentions the mo&s;t hone&s;t, can do nothing in war. The at|tachment of mo&s;t men to their parties, weakened their af|fection to their country. It has been imagined that mini|&s;ters did not always wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s even to their own &s;chemes le&s;t obnoxious men &s;hould acquire credit by the execution of them; as it was &s;u&s;pected that officers even at the ex|pence of their own reputation, did not exert their faculties to the utmo&s;t, le&s;t a di&s;agreeable mini&s;terial &s;y&s;tem &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of its coun&s;els by the vigour of their operations. For my part, I think that the&s;e refinements, in which there is often as much malice di&s;covered as penetra|tion, have carried the matter infinitely too far. But certain it is, that the &s;pirit of per&s;onal parties and attachments, ne|ver carried to greater lengths than at that time, proved of very bad con&s;equences, if it had no other effect than to rai&s;e and to give a colour to &s;uch &s;u&s;picions as we have fir&s;t mentioned. Whatever was the cau&s;e, it is mo&s;t certain, that our &s;ucce&s;s in America this year, no more an&s;wered to the greatne&s;s of our preparations and our hopes than it did in the two preceding.</P>
<P>The attack upon Crown Point, which had been a princi|pal object of our attention in the beginning, &s;eemed at this time to be laid a&s;ide; and an expedition to Loui&s;bourg, un|doubtedly a more con&s;iderable object in it&s;elf, &s;upplied its place. Lord Loudoun was to command the land forces in this expedition; Admiral Holborn the navy. The former left New York with a body of 6000 men, and &s;ailed to Halifax, where he was joined by the latter,

 <MILESTONE N="July 9."> 

 who had &s;ailed from Corke on the 7th of May with a con&s;iderable fleet, and much the &s;ame number of land forces, which his Lord&s;hip had brought from New York. When the united armies and fleets were on the point of de|parting for Loui&s;bourg, news arrived at Halifax, that the Bre&s;t fleet con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen &s;hips of the line be&s;ides frigates, with great &s;upplies of military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and men, were arrived at the harbour which they were pre|paring to attack. This news immediately &s;u&s;pended their preparations. Councils of war were held one after another. The re&s;ult of the whole was, that as the place was &s;o well reinforced, the fleet of the French rather &s;uperior to our navy, and the &s;ea&s;on &s;o far advanced, it was the more pru|dent
<PB N="40" REF="59">
cour&s;e to defer the enterpri&s;e to a more favourable op|portunity. This re&s;olution &s;eems to have been mo&s;t eligible in their circum&s;tances, becau&s;e the council of war was almo&s;t unanimous in it.</P>
<P>Lord Loudoun returned to New York, and the Admiral now freed from the care of the tran&s;ports &s;et &s;ail for Loui&s;|bourg, in hopes as it was &s;aid, of drawing the French fleet to an engagement. But upon what grounds this hope was conceived, I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee; as it could not be ima|gined, that the French fleet having no &s;ort of occa&s;ion to fight in order to protect Loui&s;bourg, would chu&s;e out of a bravado to bring on an unnece&s;&s;ary battle. However it was, the Engli&s;h &s;quadron continued to cruize off that har|bour until the 25th of September, when they were overtaken by a terrible &s;torm, in which one of our &s;hips was lo&s;t, eleven di&s;ma&s;ted, and the re&s;t returned to England in a very &s;hat|tered condition. This was the end of the expedition to Loui&s;bourg from which &s;o much was expected. But it was not the wor&s;t con&s;equences which attended it.</P>
<P>Since O&s;wego had been taken, the French remained en|tirely ma&s;ters of all the lakes, and we could do nothing to ob&s;truct their collecting the Indians from all parts, and obliging them to act in their favour. But our apprehen&s;ions, (or what &s;hall they be called?) did more in favour of the French than their conque&s;ts. Not &s;atified with the lo&s;s of that important fortre&s;s, we our&s;elves abandoned to the mer|cy of the enemy all the country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who pre&s;erved even the appearance of friend&s;hip to us. The forts we had at the Great carrying Place were demoli&s;hed; Wood Creek was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;topped up and filled with logs; by which it became evident to all tho&s;e who knew that country, that our communication with our allied Indians was totally cut off; and what was wor&s;e, our whole frontier left perfectly uncovered to the irruption of the enemies &s;avages, who &s;oon availed them|&s;elves of our errors. For after the removal of the&s;e barriers, and the taking of Fort William Henry, of which we &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, they de&s;troyed with fire and &s;word the fine &s;ettlements which we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the Mohawks river and on tho&s;e grounds called the German flats. Thus with a va&s;t increa&s;e of our forces, and the cleare&s;t &s;uperiority over the enemy, we only abandoned our allies, expo&s;ed our peo|ple, and relinqui&s;hed a large and valuable tract of country.
<PB N="41" REF="60">
The French &s;oon made us feel effectually the want of what we had lo&s;t, and what we had thrown away.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable fort called Fort William-Henry, had been built on the &s;outhern edge of the Lake George, in order to command that lake, and to cover our frontiers; a garri&s;on of 2500 men defended it. General Webb with about 4000 men was po&s;ted at no great di&s;tance. No &s;ooner had the French learned that my Lord Loudoun with the body of the army was gone on the Loui&s;bourg expedition, than they prepared to take advantage of his ab&s;ence. They drew toge|ther all the forces which they had at Crown-Point, Ticon|deroga, and the adjacent po&s;ts; they added a con&s;iderable body of Canadians, and a greater number of Indians than they had ever yet employed; the whole made near 8000 men. With the&s;e and a very good artillery, Mon&s;ieur Montcalm prepared to be&s;iege Fort William-Henry. It is &s;aid that the advances of this commander were not made with &s;o much &s;ecre&s;y as to prevent General Webb from having early intelligence of his motions; but unfortunately no credit being given to this intelligence, orders were not &s;ent to collect the militia in &s;ufficient time, which in con|junction with his own forces, and with tho&s;e in the fort had either obliged the French to relinqui&s;h their attempt, or to have made it a very great hazard. But the &s;iege being now regularly formed, and the be&s;iegers meeting but little oppo&s;ition from within,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 3."> 

 and no di&s;tur|bance at all from without, the place was in &s;ix days &s;urrendered by the advice of General Webb;

 <MILESTONE N="9th."> 

 who&s;e intercepted letter M. Montcalm &s;ent into the fort.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on marched out with their arms, and engaged not to &s;erve during eighteen months. The French &s;avages paid no regard to the capitulation, but falling upon our men as they marched out, dragged away the little effects they had left, hawling the Indians and Blacks in our &s;er|vice out of their ranks, &s;calping &s;ome, carrying off others, and committing a thou&s;and outrages and barbarities, from which the French commander endeavoured in vain to re&s;train them. All this was &s;uffered by 2000 men with arms in their hands, from a di&s;orderly crew of &s;avages. However, the greate&s;t part of our men, though in a bad condition, got to Fort Edward, &s;ome by flight; &s;ome having &s;urrendered them&s;elves to the French, were by
<PB N="42" REF="61">
them &s;ent home. The enemy demoli&s;hed the fort, car|ried off the provi&s;ion, ammunition, artillery, and the ve&s;|&s;els which we had prepared on the lake, and departed without attempting any thing farther. Neither was any thing farther attempted on our &s;ide. And thus was fini&s;hed the third campaign in North America, where we had actually near 20,000 regular troops, a great number of provincial forces, and a great naval power of upwards of twenty &s;hips of the line.</P>
<P>A war between the maritime powers is felt in all parts of the world. Not content with inflaming Europe and Ame|rica, and di&s;&s;entions of the French and Engli&s;h pur&s;ued the tracts of their commerce, and the Genges felt the fatal ef|fects of a quarrel on the Ohio. But here the &s;cene is changed greatly to the advantage of our nation; the bra|very of Admiral Wat&s;on and Colonel Clive, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the military honour of the Engli&s;h, which was &s;inking there as it had done in all other places. Admiral Wat&s;on with no more than three &s;hips of the line, &s;ailed from Madra&s;s, and afer a tedious voyage arrived at the port of Bala&s;ore in the kingdom of Bengal,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 5."> 

 where &s;trength|ening his force with what recruits he could draw together, he entered the Ganges, and after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bu&s;budgia fort which commanded that part of the river.

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 30."> 

 This opened him a pa&s;&s;age to the fort of Calcutta, the late prin|cipal &s;ettlement of the company in Bengal, and the &s;cene of the deplorable &s;ufferings of &s;o many of our unfortunate countrymen. Animated with revenge at the affecting &s;ight of this place, our &s;hips and land forces attacked it with &s;o much &s;pirits, that the Indians &s;urrendered it on the &s;ame day it was approached. A few days after Hugly, &s;ituated higher up the Ganges, was reduced with as little difficulty.</P>
<P>The Nabob, who &s;aw that the torrent of the Engli&s;h va|lour could not be re&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch feeble dams as forts de|fended by Indians, drew down a whole army con&s;i&s;ting of 10,000 hor&s;e, and 12,000 foot, to drive them from their conque&s;ts, Infinitely inferior as our troops were in number, they did not he&s;itate to attack the Nabob's army. Though our forces did not entirely rout the In|dians,

 <MILESTONE N="Feb. 5."> 

 yet they made a great &s;laughter among&s;t them; and they had &s;o much the advantage of the field, that the Nabob was in a &s;hort time glad to con|clude a treaty of peace,

 <MILESTONE N="9th."> 

 by which the Engli&s;h
<PB N="43" REF="62">
Ea&s;t-India company was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all its antient pri|vileges; an immunity from all taxes was granted, and a re&s;titution promi&s;ed for all that the trade had &s;uffered in the taking of Calcutta.</P>
<P>When all ob&s;truction on the &s;ide of the Indians was re|moved, and the company's officers had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their antient e&s;tabli&s;hments, the Admiral turned his arms again&s;t the French. He re&s;olved to attack Chandenagore, &s;ituated &s;omewhat higher on the river than Calcutta; a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength and the principal &s;ettlement of the French in that part of the Ea&s;t-Indies. In this ex|pedition Colonel Clive commanded 700 Europeans and 1600 Black &s;oldiers. The Admirals Wat&s;on and Pocock com|manded the fleet, if it may be called a fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of no more than three &s;hips of the line, the Kent, the Ty|ger, and the Sali&s;bury. The French prepared in the be&s;t manner they could to receive them, and &s;unk &s;everal large ve&s;&s;els both above and below their fort; but the Admiral having by carefully &s;ounding found a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age without being driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of weighing up any of the &s;hips, made &s;o &s;evere a fire upon the fort, in which he was &s;econded by Colonel Clive's batteries on the &s;hore, that the place capitulated in le&s;s than three hours.

 <MILESTONE N="May 24."> 

 500 Europeans and 700 Blacks &s;urrendered pri&s;o|ners of war; 183 pieces of cannon were found in the place, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable value in goods and money. Four forts co&s;t our troops no more than four days to reduce them.</P>
<P>The judicious timeing of the&s;e &s;everal operations, as well as tho&s;e which followed, was not le&s;s laudable than the gallant &s;pirit with which they were executed. Before the French were alarmed, cure was taken to re-po&s;&s;e&s;s all the po&s;ts we formerly held; to humble the Nabob by &s;ome ef|fectual blow; and by a treaty tie up his hands from acting again&s;t us. This Prince had &s;hewed him&s;elf from the mo|ment of his &s;igning that treaty, very little inclined to abide by the &s;tipulations he had made. He indeed promi&s;ed abundantly, but always deferred the performance upon &s;uch frivolous pretences, as evidently demon&s;trated his ill inten|tions. The Engli&s;h commanders under&s;tood this proceed|ing perfectly well; but they re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble their &s;en&s;e of it, until they had broken the French power in this pro|vince, which they had greater rea&s;on to dread, &s;mall as it
<PB N="44" REF="63">
was, than all the armies of the Nabob. When they had fully accompli&s;hed this by the taking of Chandenagore, they deliberated whether they ought not to re-commence ho&s;tili|ties with the Indians. A re&s;olution in the affirmative had been attended with great difficulty and danger, if a mo&s;t fortunate incident had not helped to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Nabob Suraja Doula, the &s;ame who had the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken Calcutta, had &s;hewn to his own &s;ubjects the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lent and perfidous &s;pirit, which formerly and &s;till di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h. His Generals were mo&s;tly di&s;contented, and &s;ome of them entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t him. Jaffier Ali Cawn one of his principal officers, a man of great power and intere&s;t, was at the head of this con&s;piracy. As &s;oon as their de&s;igns were ripened, they communicated them to the Engli&s;h government in Calcutta, praying their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The chiefs there did not he&s;itate long what party they &s;hould take; they entered into a treaty with Jeffier Ali Cawn and the con&s;pirators; and in con&s;equence of this treaty, our troops immediately took the field uner Colonel Clive. The Admiral undertook to garri&s;on the fort of Chandenagore with his &s;eamen, in order to leave the greater number of land forces for the expedition. A detachmnnt of fifty &s;ea|men with their officers were added to &s;erve as gunners. A twenty gun &s;hip was &s;tationed above Hugly, in order to pre&s;erve a communication between Colonel Clive and the Admiral.</P>
<P>Their preliminary mea&s;ures being thus judiciou&s;ly taken, they advanced up the river, and in a few days brought the Nabob's army of about 20,000 men exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who favoured the con&s;pirators, to an action, which was deci&s;ive in favour of the Engli&s;h.

 <MILESTONE N="June 22."> 

 Two con&s;ider|able bodies commanded by Jaffier and Roy Dolub remained inactive in the engagement. The Nabob &s;eeing him&s;elf ruined by the treachery of his officers and the cow|ardice of his troops, fled with the few who continued faith|ful to him.</P>
<P>Jaffier Ali Cawn now declared him&s;elf openly; and en|tering Muxadavat the capital of the province with an army of his friends and victorious allies,

 he was placed by Colonel Clive in the antient &s;eat of the Nabobs, and received the homage of all ranks of people as Suba of Bengal, Bahar and Orixa. The depo&s;ed Nabob was &s;oon after made pri&s;oner, and put to death in his pri&s;on

by the conqueror. In about thirteen days this great revo|lution was accompli&s;hed; and with le&s;s force and trouble than is often required to take a petty village in Germany, was transferred the government of a va&s;t kingdom, yielding in its dimen&s;ions to few in Europe, but to none in the ferti|lity of its &s;oil, the number of its inhabitants, and the rich|ne&s;s of its commerce. By the alliance with the new Nabob, and by the reduction of Chandenagore, the French were entirely driven out of Bengal and all its dependencies. This was one of the articles of the treaty. By the other articles, a perpetual alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive was made be|tween the parties. The territories of the company were enlarged, and upwards of two millions &s;terling was &s;tipu|lated to be paid as an indemnification to the Ea&s;t-India com|pany, and the &s;ufferers in the taking of Calcutta. The new Nabob, full of gratitude to tho&s;e to whom he owed his dig|nity, gave, be&s;ides the above large &s;ums, about 600,0000 pounds, as a gratuity to the &s;ea &s;quadron and the troops. However &s;hort of expectation our enterpri&s;es in America fell this year, tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t-Indies greatly exceeded every thing we could hope from the forces which were employed. And it may be doubted whether all the great powers en|gaged in the pre&s;ent bloody wars in Europe, in which &s;uch torrents of blood were &s;pilled, and &s;o many millions of trea|&s;ure are wa&s;ted, will in the conclu&s;ion reap among&s;t them &s;o much &s;olid profit as the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company did with a handful of men in a &s;hort campaign. The joy of the na|tion at the&s;e &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, was not a little damped by the death of Admiral Wat&s;on, who lo&s;t his life by the unwhole&s;omne&s;s of the country,

overtures towards peace from any of the powers at war. And perhaps nothing &s;o &s;ingular ever happened, as that &s;o many &s;tates, united, if not again&s;t their real intere&s;ts, yet again&s;t all their former habits of connection, full of &s;o ma|ny occa&s;ions of jealou&s;y, abounding with matter of com|plaint again&s;t each other, and even involved in misfortunes which u&s;ually de&s;troy a mutual confidence, that not one of the&s;e powers either from fear, or hope, or wearine&s;s, or levity, de&s;i&s;ted from their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; nor did that monarch acquire one ally more by the admiration of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, than he had formerly gained through compa&s;&s;ion to his misfortunes. All the confe|derates pre&s;erved the &s;ame attachment to each other, to him the &s;ame animo&s;ity. It is equally a matter of great ad|miration, how the re&s;ources even of the&s;e great &s;tates, could keep pace with their ambition, and in a very few months &s;upply the place of great armies almo&s;t wholly de|&s;troyed. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia by his victories had added to his natural re&s;ources. The&s;e re&s;ources were more con&s;ide|rable than is commonly imagined; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony which yielded him great &s;upplies, &s;aved his own revenue. He was indeed not quite &s;o fre&s;h as at the be|ginning of the war; but then the condition of the enemy was in many re&s;pects far wor&s;e than his. His troops had be&s;ides acquired a high reputation and a clear &s;uperiority over all others. The con&s;ideration, however, of an army greatly harra&s;&s;ed, and a mo&s;t &s;evere winter, obliged him to re&s;train his ardor, and to attempt nothing again&s;t the Au&s;trians in the months of January, February and March. The &s;ame inaction owing to much the &s;ame cau&s;es, pre|vailed among&s;t the Hanoverians for a little time: but hav|ing been reinforced about the middle of February by a body of Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e, they put their whole army once more in motion.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu had been recalled, and the Count of Clermont now commanded the French troops. This was their third commander in chief within the &s;pace of a year; a circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficient to &s;hew the un&s;teadi|ne&s;s of their councils, and the irregularity of their opera|tions. In effect, they every where retreated before the Hanoverians, who&s;e main body marched on the right to the country of Bremen; whil&s;t a &s;econd body under Gene|ral Za&s;trow kept on the left towards Gifforn. They pu&s;hed
<PB N="47" REF="68">
the French from po&s;t to po&s;t. They abliged them to eva|cuate Otter&s;berg, Bremen and Werden. The ca&s;tle of Rotterberg was taken in &s;ix hours. A con&s;iderable detach|ment under Count Chabot was po&s;ted at Hoya, a &s;trong fort upon the We&s;er, and a place of &s;uch con&s;equence that prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to di&s;lodge the enemy from it. He appointed for that &s;ervice the hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, with four batalions of foot and &s;ome light hor&s;e. This Prince, not twenty year of age, had already entered into the cour&s;e of glory under the au&s;pices of his uncle, and full of ardor to &s;ignalize him&s;elf, with joy em|braced the occa&s;ion; and here he gave an earne&s;t of his fame, in one of the mo&s;t lively and be&s;t conducted actions in the war. The fir&s;t fruits of this young hero were &s;uch as would have done honour to the maturity of the mo&s;t experienced &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The Prince had a broad and deep river to pa&s;s. He had no means of tran&s;porting his men, but a &s;ingle float;

 <MILESTONE N="Feb. 23."> 

 &s;o that a long time mu&s;t be &s;pent in get|ting them over: what was wor&s;t, before half his troops were pa&s;&s;ed, a &s;trong wind aro&s;e, which rendered the float un&s;erviceable, and entirely cut off all communication between the Prince and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable number of his party, whil&s;t the party he was going to attack was &s;u|perior to him, had his whole body been together. In this exigence the Prince came to a re&s;olution worthy of him&s;elf. He re&s;olved not to &s;pend any time in attempts to bring over the re&s;t of his troops, much le&s;s to make any at|tempts to return to them; but to urge on boldly, in &s;uch a manner as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the enemy with an opinion of his &s;trength, and to attack them bri&s;kly before they could be undeceived. Therefore, between four and five o'clock in the morning, they marched with the utmo&s;t &s;peed directly to the town of Hoya. When they had approached within a mile and a half of the place, another accident was on the point of defeating the whole enterpri&s;e. Their detachment fired by mi&s;take upon four of the enemies dragoons, who were patrolling; the firing was caught from one to another, and at la&s;t became general. This &s;eemed more than enough to di&s;cover their motions and alarm the enemy. But the &s;ame &s;pirit influenced the conduct of every part of this af|fair; a bold countenance became nece&s;&s;ary, and it was a&s;&s;umed; they marched with the utmo&s;t diligence to the
<PB N="48" REF="69">
town, and encountered the enemy at the bridge; a fierce fire, well &s;upported on either &s;ide, en&s;ued. The ground was &s;uch, that the Prince could not bring up his whole de|tatchment equally. Sen&s;ible of this di&s;advantage, he form|ed a de&s;ign to overcome it, as judicious, as it was re&s;olute, which was to turn the enemy by attacking them in the rear; to execute this de&s;ign, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a circuit about the town. Every thing &s;ucceeded: The attack on the enemy's rear was made with bayonnets fixed, a terrible &s;laughter en&s;ued. The French abondoned the bridge, and fled in confu&s;ion: The Prince having cleared the town of the enemy, joined the party he had left. The Count de Chabot threw him&s;elf, with two batallions into the ca&s;tle, with a re&s;olution to maintain him&s;elf there; but in a little time he capitulated, &s;urrendering the place, his &s;tores, and magazines, his troops being permitted to march out. The Prince, who had no artillery, and who, on account of the badne&s;s of the roads, de&s;paired of bringing up heavy cannon, &s;uffered them to depart. Six hundred and &s;eventy men were made pri&s;oners in the action, and a place of much importance, and which opened a pa&s;&s;age over the We&s;er, &s;ecured to the Hanoverians, with the lo&s;s of le&s;s than 1000 men killed and wounded. I have dwelt on this action, and de&s;cribed it as particularly as I could, though nothing deci&s;ive in it&s;elf, becau&s;e it is not in pitched battles between great armies, where the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;trokes of conduct are always di&s;played; the&s;e le&s;&s;er affairs frequently call for as much or more of &s;agacity, re&s;olution, and pre|&s;ence of mind, in the commander; yet are they often &s;lighly pa&s;&s;ed by, as matters of no con&s;equence, by the generality of people, who rather con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the event, than the &s;pirit of the action.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand continued to advance, with his right on one &s;ide of the We&s;er, and his left on the other; the French continued to retire, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively abandoned all the places they had occupied in the electorate, except Minden. A garri&s;on of 4000 men defended that place; but it was clo&s;ely inve&s;ted, and in nine days the whole garri&s;on &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war.

 <MILESTONE N="March 14."> 

 Se|veral &s;kirmi&s;hes happened between the advanced parties of the Hanoverian army and the French, always to the advantage of the former. The wretched con|dition of the French troops is hardly to be de&s;cribed or ima|gined:
<PB N="49" REF="70">
officers and &s;oldiers involved in one common di&s;tre&s;s; the officers forgot their rank, and the &s;oldiers their obedi|ence; full ho&s;pitals, and empty magazines; a rigorous &s;ea|&s;on and bad covering; their baggage &s;eized or abandoned, and the hu&s;&s;ars and hunters of the allied army continually hara&s;&s;ing, pillaging, and cutting them off. It was no alle|viation to their mi&s;ery, that the inhabitants of the country, which they abandoned, were reduced to the &s;ame extremi|ties. The &s;avage behaviour of &s;ome of their troops at their departure, took away all compa&s;&s;ion for their &s;ufferings; but this was not univer&s;al. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in Hanover, quitted the place with the &s;ame virtue, that he had &s;o long held it. Re&s;entment had no power to per&s;wade him to act with rigour, in the adver&s;e turn of the French affairs, than the pride of conque&s;t had in their pro&s;perity. When he had orders to evacuate the place, there were very con&s;iderable magazines of corn and forage, ama&s;&s;ed for the u&s;e of the army; he had full time to burn them, and he had precedents enough to have ju&s;ti|fied the action: but he left the whole in the hands of the magi&s;trates, to be gratuitou&s;ly di&s;tributed to the poor: he employed all his vigilance to prevent the lea&s;t di&s;order among&s;t his troops, and was him&s;elf the la&s;t man that marched out of the town. This behaviour, which did &s;uch honour to his name and country, has made his memory for ever dear to the Hanoverians, drew tears of love and grati|tude from his enemies, and acknowledgments from the generous Prince again&s;t whom he &s;erved.</P>
<P>The French, through extreme difficulties, marched to|wards the Rhine in three columns. The &s;everal &s;cattered bodies, which had united at Mun&s;ter, formed the right. The body, which came from Paderborn; and which was commanded by the prince of Clermont in per&s;on, march|ed in the middle. The forces which had occupied He&s;&s;e were on the left. In this order they reached the Rhine, which they all pa&s;&s;ed, except a body under Count Cler|mont, who &s;till remained at We&s;el, and re&s;olved to main|tain that po&s;t. The French army, which about four months before had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in numbers, and in a condition to make the mo&s;t powerful enemies tremble, with|out any adver&s;e &s;troke of war what&s;oever, by a fate almo&s;t unparalleled, now repa&s;&s;ed it like fugitives, in a condition the mo&s;t deplorable, reduced to le&s;s than half their original

number, and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the enemy, which they had obliged to lay down their arms.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ill fortune, and the &s;ame de&s;pair of their af|fairs followed them every where. On the arrival of a &s;mall Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by commodore Holmes before Embden, and their taking an advantageous &s;ituation,

As &s;oon as Mr. Holmes di&s;covered their de&s;ign, and that they were tran&s;|porting their artillery and baggage up the river, he order|ed out a few armed boats to pur&s;ue them. The&s;e took &s;ome of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els, in which were the &s;on of an officer of di&s;tinction, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. The commodore without delay re&s;tored the &s;on to his fa|ther, and offered to return the money, on receiving the officer's word of honour, that it was his private property. This affair is mentioned, not only to do ju&s;tice to the judi|cious conduct by which a place of &s;o much con&s;ideration was &s;o ea&s;ily carried, but al&s;o to that genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, which &s;o nobly di&s;tingui&s;hes almo&s;t all tho&s;e, who hold any rank in our &s;ervice.</P>

<P>WHILST the French arms &s;uffered &s;uch di&s;graces abroad, they endeavoured by an alteration of their councils at home, to re&s;tore their credit. Their mini&s;ters had been long the &s;port of female caprice; it was their power of plea&s;ing a mi&s;tre&s;s who governed their King, that alone qualified them to &s;erve their country. Some of the mo&s;t able men were turned out of their employments with di&s;grace; others retired from the publick &s;ervice with in|dignation; a certain low character had for a long time ap|peared
<PB N="51" REF="72">
in all the proceedings of France, both within and without. Even in their dome&s;tic di&s;putes, and where &s;omething of a free and manly &s;pirit appeared, this &s;pirit evaporated, and &s;pent it&s;elf upon unworthy and de&s;picable objects. The&s;e conte&s;ts which involved the church, the law and the crown, weakened them all; and the &s;tate felt all the ill effects of di&s;union of its orders, without &s;ee|ing an augmentation of power thrown into the &s;cale of any. But now taught by their misfortunes and di&s;graces, they were obliged to an alteration in their conduct: they were obliged to call men to the public &s;ervice upon public prin|ciples: at a time indeed, when in many re&s;pects things could only be altered, not mended: and wi&s;e and able mi|ni&s;ters could do little more by their penetration and public &s;pirit, than to &s;ee and lament the ruin, cau&s;ed by the want of tho&s;e virtues in their predece&s;&s;ors. The duke de Belle|i&s;le, known to all Europe for his great abilities, and his great exploits, was at length placed at the head of the mili|tary department, as &s;ecretary at war.</P>
<P>There appeared in the common prints a &s;peech, &s;aid to be made by that nobleman in council; which, if it be not authentic, contains at lea&s;t &s;uch &s;entiments, as would come not unnaturally from a French patriot, and one who had &s;erved his King and country with honour during better times.</P>
<P><Q>I know, &s;aid he, the &s;tate of our armies. It gives me great grief, and no le&s;s indignation: for be&s;ides the real evil of the di&s;order in it&s;elf, the di&s;grace and infamy which it reflects on our government, and on the whole nation, is &s;till more to be apprehended. The choice of officers ought to be made with mature deliberation. I know but too well to what length the want of di&s;cipline, pillaging and robbing have been carried on by the officers and common men, after the example &s;et them by their generals. It mortifies me to think I am a Frenchman; my principals are known to be very different from tho&s;e which are now followed. I had the &s;atisfaction to retain the e&s;teem, the friend&s;hip and the con&s;ideration, of all the princes, noblemen, and even all the common people in all parts of Germany where I commanded the king's forces. They lived there in the mid&s;t of abundance; every one was plea&s;ed; it fills my &s;oul with angui&s;h, to find that at pre&s;ent the French are held in execration;
<PB N="52" REF="73">
that every body is di&s;pirited, and that many officers pub|lickly &s;ay things that are criminal and highly puni&s;hable. The evil is &s;o great that it demands immediate redre&s;s. I can ea&s;ily judge, by what pa&s;&s;es in my own brea&s;t, of what our generals feel from the &s;peeches they mu&s;t daily hear in Germany, concerning our conduct; which indeed would lo&s;e much to be compared with that of our allies. I mu&s;t particularly complain of the delays and irregularity of the po&s;ts; a &s;ervice which is very ill pro|vided for. I am likewi&s;e di&s;plea&s;ed with the negligence of our generals returning an&s;wers; which is a manife&s;t breach of their duty. Had I commanded the army, a thou&s;and things which are done, would not have been done; and others, which are neglected, would have been executed. I would have multiplied my communi|cations; I would have had &s;trong po&s;ts on the right, on the left, and in the centre lined with troops. I would have had magazines in every place. The quiet and &s;atis|faction of the country &s;hould have been equal to their pre|&s;ent di&s;affection, at being harra&s;&s;ed and plundered; and we &s;hould have been as much beloved, as we are at pre&s;ent abhorred. The con&s;equences are too apparent to need being mentioned. I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e things, becau&s;e late redre&s;s is better than the continuation of the evil.</Q></P>
<P>M. de Bellei&s;le being e&s;tabli&s;hed in his office, turned all his attention to the cure of the evils, which he lamented; and exerted all the power that remained in the nation, to put their army in Germany once more upon a re&s;pectable footing. The expedition into Germany was originally a mea&s;ure as contrary to the true intere&s;ts of France, as it was of ju&s;tice and equity; but having adopted that mea&s;ure, the con&s;equences which aro&s;e &s;eemed to demand that it &s;hould be pur&s;ued with vigour. Therefore the connection with the Empre&s;s Queen was drawn clo&s;er than ever, and nothing was omitted to give a greater &s;trength, and a better order to the army on the Rhine. But the&s;e endeavours which &s;trained all the &s;inews of France, already too much weakened by the almo&s;t total ruin of &s;everal e&s;&s;ential bran|ches of their trade, drew away all the re&s;ources nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their navy. It was then in a &s;ufficiently bad condition, from a want of &s;eamen and &s;tores; and there were no means found, or little attention u&s;ed, to re&s;tore it: &s;o that from a deficiency in the marine, it &s;eemed to be
<PB N="53" REF="74">
equally impracticable to feed the war in America, or to pre&s;erve the coa&s;t of France it&s;elf from in&s;ults. Such was the condition of our enemies, at the opening of the cam|paign of 1758.</P>
<P>As to England, far from being exhau&s;ted by the war, or di&s;pirited by our ill &s;ucce&s;s, our hopes ro&s;e from our di&s;ap|pointments, and our re&s;ources &s;eemed to be augmented by our expences; with &s;uch ea&s;e and alacrity were the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies granted and rai&s;ed. Many errors and many abu&s;es which the war di&s;covered without making fatal, were corrected. The &s;pirit of our officers was revived by fear or by &s;hame. Our trade was well protected by the &s;u|periority, and prudent di&s;tribution of our naval force. The revenue was frugally managed, and the whole &s;tate well cemented and bound together in all its parts, by the union of the admini&s;tration, by the patrioti&s;m which ani|mated it, and by the entire confidence which the people had in the pre&s;iding abilities and intentions. As France per&s;i&s;ted in her attachment to the enemies of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, Great Britain entered into &s;till clo&s;er engagements with that monarch, the lu&s;tre of who&s;e virtues, &s;et off by his late wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es, quite turned our eyes from the objections which were rai&s;ed again&s;t the con&s;i&s;tency of that alliance with our intere&s;ts. How far it is con&s;i&s;tent with them, is I think, a much more difficult point to &s;ettle, than the adherents to either party &s;eem willing to allow. But it ought to be con&s;idered, that the circum&s;tances of affairs in the beginning of the war, hardly admitted of any other choice; it had been the height of madne&s;s, to have been on ill terms with his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty at that time; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to have kept good terms with him, without being on very bad ones with Vienna. Things were in an ill &s;ituation; and the ballance of Germany was in danger of being over&s;et, what party &s;oever &s;hould pre|vail. It was impo&s;&s;ible that England could have &s;tood neu|ter in this conte&s;t: if &s;he had, France would not have imi|tated her moderation; &s;he would gladly have joined with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to di&s;tre&s;s Hanover, and reduce Au&s;tria. The&s;e two powers &s;o exerted, would doubtle&s;s compa&s;s their end, unle&s;s we interpo&s;ed to prevent it; and we mu&s;t &s;ooner or later have interpo&s;ed, unle&s;s we were re&s;olved tamely to &s;ee France and her allies giving laws to the conti|nent. In a word, France would certainly have joined with
<PB N="54" REF="75">
one party or the other, and the party which &s;he joined, would certainly, by that union, prove dangerous to the common liberty, and mu&s;t therefore be oppo&s;ed by us; we mu&s;t have been in &s;pite of us engaged in the troubles of Germany, as we ever have been, and ever &s;hall be, as long as we are a people of con&s;ideration in Europe. The alliance with Pru&s;&s;ia was pointed out to us by the circum&s;tance of his acting on the defen&s;ive. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia medita|ted no conque&s;ts. But her imperial maje&s;ty indi&s;putably aimed at the recovery of Sile&s;ia, which was to di&s;turb the &s;ettled order of things; and this de&s;ign was the only cau&s;e of the troubles in that part of the world. I am &s;en&s;ible that this is notwith&s;tanding all that may be &s;aid, a que&s;tion of &s;ome intricacy, and requires a con&s;ideration of many more particulars, than the brevity of our de&s;ign will allow. But whether we cho&s;e our party in this alliance judiciou&s;ly or not, we have, I imagine, very great rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with a mea&s;ure, which has induced France to engage &s;o deeply in the affairs of Germany, at &s;o ruinous an expence of her blood and trea&s;ure. Our mini&s;try was at this time fully convinced of the prudence of the choice that had been made, and re&s;olved to &s;upport his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, and the army under Prince Ferdinand, in the mo&s;t effectual manner; 100,000 l. were voted for the Hanoverian and He&s;&s;ian forces; and a convention between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,

 <MILESTONE N="Ap. 11."> 

 and his Britannic maje&s;ty, was &s;igned in London, whereby the King of Great Britain engages to pay his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty the &s;um of 670,000 l. &s;terling; and each of the contracting powers engaged to conclude no peace without the participitation of the other.</P>
<P>The northern courts made no alteration in their &s;y&s;tem. In Sweden, &s;ome real plots to di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed con|&s;titution ended in the ruin of their contrivers; &s;ome ficti|tious plots were &s;et on foot to give a &s;anction to mea&s;ures again&s;t the crown party, which an&s;wered their ends; and, as the ruling power continued the &s;ame and the internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions the &s;ame, the ho&s;tilities again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia were re&s;olved with the former animo&s;ity, but pro|mi&s;ed to be pur&s;ued with the former languor. In Ru&s;&s;ia, the Empre&s;s did not think her intentions well &s;econded by her mini&s;ters. The great delays, and the unaccountable retreat in the la&s;t campaign, gave ground to &s;u&s;pect, that
<PB N="55" REF="76">
&s;he had been betrayed by her mini&s;ters, or her generals. M. Apraxin was moved from the command, and was put under arre&s;t. He ju&s;tified his conduct by expre&s;s orders from Count Be&s;tuchef. Be&s;tuchef was removed from his office, and put under arre&s;t al&s;o. Count Woronzoff &s;uc|ceeded Be&s;tuchef in his employment, and the generals Brown and Fermor took the command of the army in the place of Apraxin.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;eason permitted the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to re-commence his operations, he laid &s;iege to Schweidnitz, and pu&s;hed it with &s;o much vigour,

 <MILESTONE N="April 3."> 

 that the place &s;urrendered in thirteen days. The garri&s;on reduced by &s;ickne&s;s during the blockade, and by their lo&s;&s;es during the &s;iege, from &s;even to little more than three thou&s;and men, yielded them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. By this &s;troke, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia left his enemies no foot|ing in any part of his dominions. His next con&s;ideration was how to guard again&s;t their future attempts, and at the &s;ame time to make a vigorous attack upon &s;ome part of the Au&s;trian territories. His forces were well &s;tationed for both the&s;e purpo&s;es; for be&s;ides the troops which Count Dohna commanded on the &s;ide of Pomerania, a con&s;iderable body was po&s;ted between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Sile&s;ia from the fury of the Ru&s;&s;ians, in ca&s;e they &s;hould make their inroad that way. An army, in a little time after was formed in Saxony, commanded by his bro|ther Prince Henry, which con&s;i&s;ted of thirty battalions, and forty-five &s;quadrons. It was de&s;tined to make head again&s;t the army of the Empire, which by amazing efforts made during the winter, and by the junction of a large body of Au&s;trians, was now in a condition to act again. A ready communication was kept up between all the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's armies, by a proper choice of po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olved to make Moravia the theatre of the war this year. Moravia was fre&s;h ground; a country, as yet untouched by the ravages of war. If he &s;hould &s;ucceed in his operations in this country, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es by opening to him the neare&s;t road to Vienna, mu&s;t prove more deci&s;ive than they could any where el&s;e. If he &s;hould fail, the Au&s;trians were at a di&s;tance from the centre of his affairs, and would find it difficult to improve their advantages to his ruin. After the reduction of Schweid|nitz, the King ordered two bodies of his troops to po&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="77">
them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to make it appear that he intended to carry the war into Bohemia. Whil&s;t he drew away the enemies attention from the real objects by the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, the main of his army by a very rapid march,

 <MILESTONE N="May 3."> 

 entered into Moravia in two co|lumns, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, in a &s;hort time and with little or no oppo&s;ition, of all the po&s;ts ne|ce&s;&s;ary to cover the troops to be employed in the &s;iege of Olmutz. On the 27th of May the trenches were opened before that city.</P>
<P>M. Daun was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the King's march to|wards Moravia, than he took his route through Bohemia to that province. Notwith&s;tanding that the Empre&s;s Queen omitted no po&s;&s;ible endeavours to a&s;&s;emble a large army again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, though &s;he had for that pur|po&s;e exhau&s;ted the Milane&s;e and Tu&s;cany, and &s;wept up the la&s;t recruits in her Danubian territories, M. Daun was not yet in a condition to give the King of Pru&s;&s;ia battle; neither did his character lead him to tru&s;t that to fortune, which he might en&s;ure, though more &s;lowly, by conduct. This wi&s;e general took his po&s;ts from Gewics to Littau, in a mountainous country, in a &s;ituation where it was impo&s;|&s;ible to attack him. He had the fertile country of Bohemia, from whence he readily and certainly drew &s;upplies, at his rear. He was from his po&s;ition at the &s;ame time enabled to hara&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ian army before Olmutz, and to intercept the convoys which were brought to them from Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>Olmutz, by the extent of its works, and other advan|tageous circum&s;tances, is a city which it is very difficult compleatly to inve&s;t. So that &s;ome of the King's po&s;ts be|ing nece&s;&s;arily weakened by occupying &s;o great an extent of country, were attacked by Daun's detachments from time to time, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that abundant &s;uccours both of men and ammunition were thrown into the place. The&s;e attacks were always made by night, and very few nights pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome attack. The &s;ucce&s;s was various. But the operations of the &s;iege were greatly di&s;turbed by the&s;e continual alarms. Be&s;ides it is &s;aid that the Au&s;trians, be|fore the King's inva&s;ion of this province, had de&s;troyed all the forage in the neighbourhood of Olmutz. The hor&s;e were obliged to forage at a great di&s;tance, which harra&s;&s;ed them extreamly. M. Daun took advantage of all the&s;e circum&s;tances. It was in vain that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
<PB N="57" REF="78">
endeavoured by all the arts of a great commander to pro|voke or entice him to an engagement. He profited of the advantages he had made, without being tempted by them to throw out of his hands the &s;ecure game he was play|ing.</P>
<P>The great object of M. Daun was the Pru&s;&s;ian convoys. On receiving advice that a large and important one was to leave Troppau on the 25th of June, he took mea&s;ures to intercept it. He ordered general Jahnus, who was at Muglitz on the left, to advance towards Bahrn, and a de|tachment which was at Prerau at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to the right, to march to Stadt-Leibe; &s;o that the&s;e two corps &s;hould on different &s;ides attack the convoy at one and the &s;ame time. To further the execution of this project, M. Daun him&s;elf approached the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and di|rected all his motions as if he intended to give them battle. However, the King was too great a ma&s;ter in the game of general&s;hip, which was now playing, to be deceived by this feint. He detached a con&s;iderable party under general Ziethen, to &s;upport his convoy, which was already about 7000 &s;trong. Before this detachment could come up, the convoy was attacked, but the Au&s;trians were repul&s;ed. But M. Daun, who provided for every thing, quickly reinforced his parties who renewed the engagement the next day. They fir&s;t &s;uffered the head of the convoy to go unmole&s;t|ed; but as the centre was &s;till embarra&s;&s;ed in a dangerous defile, they ea&s;ily cut off the head from the re&s;t, and then they attacked the centre with the greate&s;t fury. The Pru&s;&s;ians made as good a re&s;i&s;tance as the nature of the ground would &s;uffer. General Ziethen did every thing which could be expected from an accompli&s;hed officer; but in the end they were entirely routed; all the waggons in that divi&s;ion were taken; the rear was pu&s;hed back towards Troppau; the head alone with great difficulty arrived at the Pru&s;&s;ian camp.</P>
<P>This was a fatal &s;troke, becau&s;e it came at a time when it was impo&s;&s;ible to repair it. The &s;iege of Olmutz had been all along attended with great difficulties: and now the news which every day arrived of the nearer and nearer ap|proach of the Ru&s;&s;ians, called the King loudly to the de|fence of his own dominions. Already the Co&s;&s;acks and Calmucks made incur&s;ions into Sile&s;ia, and by their ravages and cruelties, announced the approach of the great army.
<PB N="58" REF="79">
The &s;iege mu&s;t be rai&s;ed: Moravia mu&s;t be abandoned; Mar&s;hal Daun mu&s;t have the Honour of freeing his coun|try, and driving away &s;uch an Adver&s;ary as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from a conque&s;t deemed certain; all was perform|ed without a battle, by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t refined and vi|gorous manoeuvres that ever were put in practice.</P>
<P>When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;aw that the unpro&s;perous &s;itu|ation of his affairs obliged him to retreat; he took a re&s;olu|tion, &s;uch as a victory in&s;pires in other. He took ad|vantage even of the excellent movement of M. Daun, by which that able general had advanced his quarters to Poz|nitz, and placed him&s;elf &s;o as to &s;upport Olmutz in the mo&s;t effectual manner; by this movement, however, he was obliged to uncover the frontiers of Bohemia. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, whom nothing could e&s;cape, was &s;en&s;ible of this advantage, and therefore, in&s;tead of falling back upon Sile&s;ia, which &s;tep would immediately have drawn the Au&s;trian army into his dominions, he determined to re|treat from one part of the enemies territories into another. The day before the &s;iege was rai&s;ed the firing of the Pru&s;|&s;ians continued as bri&s;k as ever, and &s;hewed no &s;ort of &s;ign of an intention to depart; but in the night the whole army took the road to Bohemia in two co|lumns,

 <MILESTONE N="July 1."> 

 and gained an entire march upon the Au|&s;trians. So that notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts which the enemy could make to overtake and hara&s;s the King upon his march, he advanced into Bohemia with little mo|le&s;tation, &s;eized upon a large magazine at Leutomi&s;&s;el, de|feated &s;ome corps of Au&s;trians who had attempted to di&s;turb him in his progre&s;s, and arrived at Konig&s;gratz, one of the mo&s;t important po&s;ts in Bohemia, with all his &s;ick and wounded, with all his heavy baggage, all his heavy Artil|lery, and military &s;tores complete. This place he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed after driving from it a body of 7000 Au&s;trians who were entrenched there. He immediately laid this city and &s;eve|ral other di&s;tricts under contribution; but his plan not ad|mitting any further operations on that &s;ide, he took no other advantage from this momentous po&s;t. He &s;oon re-entered Sile&s;ia, and marched with the mo&s;t amazing dili|gence to encounter the Ru&s;&s;ians, who had at this time united their divided corps under Brown and Fermor, and fixed the long fluctuating plan of their operations, by en|tering the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and laying &s;iege

But it is nece&s;&s;ary to break our narrative of his affairs, however intere&s;ting, to take a view of the operations of the armies on the Rhine. We leave the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in full march, do give one body of his enemies battle, after executing a retreat from the other, in a man|ner that did his military genius the greate&s;t honour. So that on the whole, it is difficult to &s;ay, which gained the greate&s;t glory, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by his retreat, or M. Daun by the mea&s;ure which obliged him to it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Allies pa&s;s the Rhine. Battle of Crevelt. Action at Sanger&s;|hau&s;en. Action at Meer. Allies repa&s;s the Rhine.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PRINCE Ferdinand had it not in his power to cut off the retreat of the French over the Rhine; but he pre&s;&s;ed them clo&s;ely, and prepared him&s;elf to cro&s;s that ri|ver in pur&s;uit of them. His de&s;ign was to carry the war beyond the Mae&s;e, and thereby oblige the Prince de Sou|bi&s;e to abandon the enterprize he was preparing again&s;t He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. His Highne&s;s executed the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine at Herven with the corps immedi|ately under his command;

 <MILESTONE N="June 1."> 

 then he &s;ent the bridge with which he &s;erved him&s;elf &s;o well up the river to Rees; the re&s;t of the troops pa&s;&s;ed there; the whole army were over before the 7th of June. The flattery of the la&s;t age &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment a pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine by a French monarch, unoppo&s;ed, at the head of a mighty army. We &s;aw that river pa&s;&s;ed by the enemies of France, in the pre&s;ence of an army of 50,000 of that nation; it was an action which did not need the exaggerations of rhetoric.</P>
<P>The French army retired as the Prince advanced, and took an advantageous camp which threatened to retard the operations of the allies: their right was under Rheinberg; but the Prince by his well-judged motions turned their left flank towards the convent of Campe, by which the French found them&s;elves obliged to quit their advantageous po&s;t,
<PB N="60" REF="81">
and to retire into Meurs: they &s;till kept towards the Rhine: the Prince advanced on the &s;ide of the Mae&s;e.</P>
<P>It was evident, that whil&s;t the French continued only to retire, it would prove impo&s;&s;ible for them to hinder the allies from executing the plan they propo&s;ed: they there|fore thought it advi&s;eable to change their countenance. They had falled back as far as Nuys; they now returned on their &s;teps, and advanced as far as Crevelt, within a few miles of Prince Ferdinand's camp. The Prince made the di&s;po&s;itions for a battle, with his u&s;ual vigour and pru|dence. He carefully reconnoitred the &s;ituation of the enemy. He found that their right was at a village called Vi&s;chelon; their left extended towards Anrath, where it was covered with a wood: Crevelt, which was in the front of their right was occupied by a party of their troops. His highne&s;s re&s;olved upon three attacks: the fir&s;t and real attack was on the flank of the enemy's left wing; the other two were de&s;igned to divert their attention, and prevent their &s;uccouring the object of his principal attack; for which purpo&s;e he recommended to his generals to make the be&s;t u&s;e of their heavy artillery, and not to advance too far unle&s;s they were perfectly a&s;&s;ured of the &s;ucce&s;s of the main operation.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e wi&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, and perfectly learn|ed the be&s;t routes by which the enemy might be approached,

 <MILESTONE N="June 23."> 

 his highne&s;s put him&s;elf at the head of the grenadiers of his right wing, and advanced on the &s;ide of Anrath in two colums. A canonading vio|lent and well &s;upported opened the action: the Hanove|rian artillery was greatly &s;uperior to that of the French; but though the French lo&s;t many men, they lo&s;t no ground in this way, and their po&s;ition in the wood made a clo&s;e attack ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: the hereditary Prince of Brun|&s;wick put him&s;elf at the head of the fir&s;t line of foot, and with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, advanced with the whole front direct|ly to the wood. Here a furious fire of &s;mall arms com|menced, which continued without the &s;malle&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion for two hours and an half. All the Hanoverian battalions threw them&s;elves into the wood: two ditches well lined with infantry were oppo&s;ed to their fury: they were forced one after another: the enemies battalions were pu&s;hed back, they were entirely broken, and fled out of the wood in a di&s;order which was irreparable: their cavalry, who
<PB N="61" REF="82">
kept the be&s;t countenance po&s;&s;ible, in &s;pite of the terrible fire of the Hanoverian artillery, and in &s;pite of the vigo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous attempts of the Hanoverian hor&s;e, who had by this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and means to gain the plain, covered the retreat of their &s;cattered infantry, and &s;aved them from utter ruin: the right wing and the centre, though they &s;uffered grievou&s;ly by the cannonading, were no where broken, but retreated towards Nuys in the mo&s;t perfect order.</P>
<P>Seven thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops were killed, wound|ed, and taken pri&s;oners; but there was nothing in this battle &s;o grievous to France, and &s;o affecting even to the enemy, as the fate of the count de Gi&s;ors. This young nobleman, the only &s;on of the duke de Bellei&s;le, not above twenty-five years of age, newly married to the heire&s;s of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e; him&s;elf the la&s;t hope of a mo&s;t noble family, was mortally wounded at the head of his regiment, which be brought up with the mo&s;t heroic courage, and in&s;pired by his example to make incredible efforts. He had been educated with all the care an excellent father could be&s;tow on a &s;on of an uncommon genius, who was alone able to &s;upport the reputation of his family. To the pure&s;t morals he had united the polite&s;t manners; he had made a great proficiency in learning; he knew many branches of it, and loved all; he had &s;een every part of Europe, and read courts and nations with a di&s;cerning eye; and wanted nothing to fulfil all hope, and to make him a perfect and la&s;ting ornament and &s;upport to his coun|try, but a knowledge in the military art; he entered that cour&s;e of glory and danger, and fell in his fir&s;t campaign. The unhappy father and mini&s;ter &s;aw his private misfor|tunes keep pace with the public calamities, and the tears of his family mingled with tho&s;e of his country.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand gained a victory at Crevelt, which did the greate&s;t honour to his military capacity, and to the bravery of his troops. But it was a victory neither entire nor deci&s;ive: the French army on their own frontiers was quickly and &s;trongly reinforced; &s;o that they were not only in a condition in &s;ome &s;ort to make head again&s;t the allies, but were enabled to detach a con&s;iderable reinforce|ment to the army of the Prince de Soubi&s;e on the other &s;ide of the Rhine.</P>
<P>Altho' the Prince had rea&s;on to imagine that he &s;hould not be able to keep his ground on this &s;ide of the Rhine for
<PB N="62" REF="83">
any con&s;iderable time, this did not hinder him from im|proving to the utmo&s;t, the advantage he had obtained. Whil&s;t the French, di&s;abled by their late defeat, were in no condition to oppo&s;e him, he pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine with a large detachment, and appeared on the 28th of June before Du&s;&s;eldorp, a city advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on the river, and belonging to the Elector Palatine. A &s;evere bombardment obliged it to capitulate on the 7th of July: the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 2000 men, marched out with the honours of war. Prince Ferdinand placed here three battalions of Hanoverians, and threw a bridge of boats acro&s;s the river; by that means he multiplied his po&s;ts and communications on both &s;ides of the Rhine; and threw a new and no &s;mall impediment in the way of the French, to retard their pro|gre&s;s, in ca&s;e he &s;hould find him&s;elf compelled to retire. After this, the army of the allies and that of France, &s;pent &s;everal days in making various marches and countermarches, as if they both propo&s;ed to bring on an action, to which, however, it does not appear that either party was very &s;trongly inclined.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand &s;till retained his hopes that the Prince of Y&s;enburg who commanded the He&s;&s;ian troops, would find the Prince of Soubi&s;e employment for &s;ome time. He had originally laid his plan in &s;uch a manner, that by pa&s;&s;ing the Mae&s;e, and transferring the &s;eat of war into the enemies country, he might draw the French from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince of Soubi&s;e to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of the main army under M. de Contades, who com|manded in the room of count Clermont, being now the fourth commander of the French troops &s;ince they entered Germany. But whil&s;t Prince Ferdinand plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tho&s;e hopes, and &s;till continued to act as far as circum|&s;tances would admit, in pur&s;uance of this plan, he received an account which di&s;concerted all his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The duke de Broglio, &s;upported by the corps of the prince de Soubi&s;e,

 <MILESTONE N="July 23."> 

 with a much &s;uperior force, attacked and defeated the He&s;&s;ian army of &s;even thou&s;and men near Sanger&s;hau&s;en: this opened to them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;er: they might act in We&s;tphalia, on which &s;ide &s;oever they plea&s;ed, and it was to be feared, that if they availed them&s;elves of the advantages they had, they might be able to intercept the Briti&s;h troops. The&s;e troops having been landed at Embden, were now on their
<PB N="63" REF="84">
march under the command of the duke of Marlborough to reinforce the allied army. The prince in this &s;ituation of affairs, had no option left but an engagement with the French army, or a retreat over the Rhine: the former was not ea&s;y to compa&s;s, as the French indu&s;triou&s;ly de|clined a battle, and it became extremely dangerous to re|main long in a po&s;ition with the enemies army on his left, and the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Gueldre on his right. In this &s;itu|ation his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence became every day more difficult. To repa&s;s the Rhine had its difficulties too; the roads which led to that river were rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able by the heavy rains; the river it&s;elf was &s;o &s;welled with them, that the bridge at Rees had been for &s;ome time u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of the allied army did not e&s;cape the penetration of Mon&s;. de Chevert, one of the able&s;t commanders among the French. He formed a plan upon them, which, if it had &s;ucceeded, mu&s;t have put the allies into the greate&s;t perplexity. This general had &s;ome time before pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, with an intention of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Du&s;&s;eldorp, and he had prepared all things with great ability for that enterpri&s;e: the rains u&s;ually heavy for that &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ome other cro&s;s accidents, had fru&s;trated his intentions. But perceiving that the &s;ame ac|cidents which defeated his de&s;ign proved al&s;o unfavourable to the enemy, he re&s;olved to turn his di&s;appointment into an advantage, and from the ruins of his fir&s;t project to build another of yet greater importance. Baron Imhoff was po&s;ted to the right of the Rhine in a &s;trong &s;ituation near Meer. He was to cover the bridge at Rees; to &s;ecure a con&s;iderable magazine; and to keep open communication between the Engli&s;h reinforcements and the main army. The plan of Mon&s;. Chevert was to di&s;lodge Imhoff, to burn the bridge at Rees, to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the magazine, and to render the junction of the Engli&s;h troops with the Hanoverians impracticable. To execute this ju|dicious &s;cheme, he united &s;everal detachments from the garri&s;on of We&s;el, to a con&s;iderable corps which he intend|ed to have employed in the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp. The whole made near 12,000 men: the troops under Imhoff were but &s;ix batallions, and four &s;quadrons, hardly 3000 in all.</P>

from the army of Prince Ferdinand: the &s;well of the river had rendered all relief impo&s;&s;ible; all his hopes were there|fore in his genius and the bravery of his troops. He con&s;idered that though the po&s;t he occupied was &s;ufficient|ly &s;trong, the enemy might make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Rees, by turning his camp, and thus execute one of the principal parts of their de&s;ign; he con&s;idered the great difference between attacking and being attacked; he con|&s;idered the effect of an attempt altogether unexpected by the enemy; he therefore took the re&s;olution of abandoning his po&s;t, and going out to meet them. Perceiving that the French were marching into difficult ground, he did not lo&s;e a moment to begin the action. He ordered a &s;mall party,

 <MILESTONE N="April 5."> 

 which he had po&s;ted in a little coppice, to fall upon the enemies left, which he ob&s;erved to be uncovered; and appointed the fire of this party, as a &s;ignal for all the re&s;t to advance, and make the on&s;et with bayonets fixed. The French thus vigorou&s;ly and unexpectedly attacked, fell into confu&s;ion; their cou|rage ill &s;econded the wi&s;dom of their general; they did not &s;tand half an hour; they left on the field of battle eleven pieces of cannon, many pri&s;oners, and much baggage to the Hanoverians, who drove them under the cannon of We&s;el.</P>
<P>This &s;ignal advantage over &s;uch a prodigious &s;uperiority was not more gallantly obtained than well pur&s;ued and im|proved. Imhoff &s;aw that the rains had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to leave no hopes for the allied army to pa&s;s by the bridge of Rees. Having taken proper care of his ma|gazines, he quitted his po&s;t at Meer, and being reinforced by &s;ome parties, who pa&s;&s;ed the river in boats, he marched with the utmo&s;t diligence towards the route of the Engli&s;h forces, and happily effected a junction, which had hitherto been attended with &s;o many difficulties.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand in his retreat met with no ob&s;truction, but ju&s;t what was &s;ufficient to di&s;play more fully the gal|lantry of his officers, and the &s;pirit of his troops. A town called Wachtendonck was on his left, as he retreated; this place, though not fortified, is a po&s;t of much importance, and being an inland &s;urrounded by the river Niers, is ex|tremely difficult of acce&s;s: the French had thrown a body of troops into this place. The hereditary prince, the fir&s;t in every active &s;ervice, was employed to force it. The
<PB N="65" REF="86">
bridge on his approach had been drawn up. The prince &s;ee|ing that if he attempted to get down this bridge, the ene|my would gain time to recollect them&s;elves, threw him&s;elf into the river; his grenadiers, animated by &s;o gallant an example, plunged in after him, and furiou&s;ly attacking the enemy with their bayonets, in a few minutes drove them from that po&s;t; this advantage, joined to that gained by general Imhoff, and the uncommon re&s;olution which ap|peared in both the&s;e actions, awed the French. They found that their troops, raw, undi&s;ciplined and little fit for hard &s;ervice, were not to be relied upon; and they feared to bring on an action, which by being deci&s;ive again&s;t them might draw on the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. So that the prince repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in a mo&s;t excellent order, even with le&s;s trouble than he had at fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed it; and indeed with little mole&s;tation, but what he met with from the weather. Such exce&s;&s;ive rains had fallen, that he in vain attempted a pa&s;&s;age at Rhineberg or at his bridge of Rees;

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 9. and 10."> 

 he effected it a little lower at a place called Griethuy&s;en.</P>
<P>Although Prince Ferdinand was obliged to pa&s;s the Rhine, and to act more upon the defen&s;ive for the future; yet his vigorous conduct in the beginning was very glorious to him, and very advantageous to the common cau&s;e. The French &s;uffered greatly in their military reputation; the Hanoverians had gained a &s;uperiority over them, and now &s;o much of the campaign was wa&s;ted, that notwith&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of their numbers, it was not probable that they would find them&s;elves able to make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s in their de&s;igns again&s;t the King's electoral domi|nions for this year. The advantage gained by Broglio and Soubi&s;e was not attended with the con&s;equences, which might have been apprehended. Prince Y&s;enburg kept &s;o good a countenance in a &s;trong po&s;t he had cho&s;en, that the French did not choo&s;e to attack him again; and &s;ince Prince Ferdinand had repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, he might always be well &s;upported.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Retreat from Bohemia. Mea&s;ures of Count Daun. Battle of Cu&s;trin. King of Pru&s;&s;ia marches into Saxony, and joins Prince Henry.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the retreat of the Pru&s;&s;ians from Moravia, the war had a&s;&s;umed a new face. The Generals who conduct|ed it had changed hands. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was obliged to act upon the defen&s;ive; M. Daun was now in a condition of di&s;playing his talents in an offen&s;ive war. The affairs of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia were &s;carce ever in a more critical &s;itu|ation than at that time. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eemed at fir&s;t di&s;|po&s;ed to enter into Sile&s;ia; but now they had united their &s;everal disjointed corps, penetrated into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and having commenced the &s;iege of Cu&s;|trin, a place that threatened them with no great oppo&s;ition, they were arrived within a few days march of Berlin Count Dohna po&s;ted with a greatly inferior force at Frank|fort on the Oder, watched without being able to ob&s;truct their progre&s;s. In Pomerania, the Generals Weedel and Manteufel oppo&s;ed almo&s;t the &s;ame ineffectual efforts to the arms of Sweden. The army of the Empire, and a con&s;i|derable body of Au&s;trians under General Haddick, advanced into Saxony, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves by degrees of tho&s;e &s;trong po&s;ts, which compo&s;e the frontiers of Mi&s;nia, they continually &s;treightened the quarters of Prince Henry. That Prince was &s;trongly encamped at Dippol&s;walde, with about 20,000 men, in order to cover Dre&s;den, and command the cour&s;e of the Elbe. Thus circum&s;tanced, the King could not find his account in remaining long in Bohemia, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to effect any thing deci&s;ive. Every thing depended upon his being able to drive the Ru&s;&s;ians out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his territories, who with a mighty forced ruined every place they arrived at, and &s;eemed not only to make war again&s;t him, but again&s;t human nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>M. Daun was &s;oon appri&s;ed of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's in|tentions: but he con&s;idered that if he was to pur&s;ue the King into Sile&s;ia, he mo&s;t encounter with difficulties almo&s;t in&s;uperable; &s;everal &s;trong places &s;tood in his way, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would prove ea&s;y for the Pru&s;&s;ian troops left for the defence of that dutchy, to take an advantageous camp under one of tho&s;e places, and thus oblige them to wa&s;te unprofitably the
<PB N="67" REF="88">
time, which might be employed in the execution of more judicious projects. Be&s;ides that in this manner of proceed|ing he could never act in concert, nor pre&s;erve any effectual communication with the &s;everal bodies of his allies. To pu&s;h forward with his whole force directly to Berlin, could at be&s;t be regarded as a <HI>coup de main,</HI> which could prove nothing deci&s;ive in the campaign, even &s;uppo&s;ing the project &s;hould &s;ucceed, but it was rather probable that it would not &s;ucceed, as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might clear his hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians before the army of M. Daun could, for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance arrive in the Lower Lu&s;atia. Every con&s;i|deration therefore pointed out the relief of Saxony as the great object of the Au&s;trian operations. It was an object apparently to be compa&s;&s;ed with greater ea&s;e, and if com|pa&s;&s;ed, productive of more &s;olid advantages than any other. The army of the Empire already &s;uperior to that of Prince Henry could co-operate in the de&s;ign, and the recovery of Saxony once effected, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia would &s;ee him&s;elf entirely dive&s;ted of one of the principal re&s;ources he had to rely upon in the war, for money, provi&s;ions, and forage; whil&s;t his hereditary dominions &s;tripped of this &s;trong bar|rier defencele&s;s in them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;aulted on three &s;ides by powerful armies, could &s;carce find them employment to the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>M. Daun having re&s;olved upon his plan of operations &s;uf|fered the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to continue his march towards the Ru&s;&s;ians, without any mole&s;tation: he contented him&s;elf with leaving a con&s;iderable body of Troops under the Gene|rals Har&s;ch and de Ville, on the &s;outhern frontiers of Sile|&s;ia, in order to form &s;ome enterpri&s;e on that &s;ide, which might draw the attention and forces of the Pru&s;&s;ians as far as po&s;&s;ible from the great object of his operations. When he had made the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions he marched towards Saxony, through the country of Lu&s;atia, by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen. His fir&s;t project was bold. He propo&s;ed to cro&s;s the Elbe at Mei&s;&s;en; by which the communication between Dre&s;den and Leip&s;ic would be cut of at one &s;troke. Then he propo&s;ed to attack Prince Henry in his camp at Seidlitz, whil&s;t the army of the Empire fell upon him in another quarter. Thus the Prince was to be put between two fires, and his retreat into Dre&s;den to be rendered impracticable; but upon mature con&s;ideration, this project was laid a&s;ide. M. Daun reflected that the fortre&s;s of Sonne&s;tein, of which he
<PB N="68" REF="89">
was not yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would prove no &s;mall impediment to his de&s;igns.

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 3."> 

 He con&s;idered that the po&s;ition of Prince Henry oppo&s;ite to the army of the Empire was too advantageous, to make an attack upon him advi&s;eable: and unle&s;s the Prince could be induced to attack the Imperiali&s;ts fir&s;t, a point not to be expected in his circum&s;tances, he might always find it ea&s;y to throw him&s;elf into Dre&s;den, and by proper motions to pre&s;erve a free communication with the King. M. Daun was obliged to renounce his fir&s;t de&s;ign, but he was left at full liberty to form and to execute &s;uch other plans for the relief of Saxony as his prudence could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>About that time the imperial court elated with their re|cent &s;ucce&s;s, began to &s;hew with what moderation they were likely to behave if it continued and increa&s;ed. They entirely threw of all the little appearance of re&s;pect they had hitherto retained for the King of Great Britain, and &s;everal others of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Princes and per&s;ons of the Empire. They made the abu&s;e of their authority go hand in hand with the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t a conclu&s;um of the Aulic council was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the King of Great Britain, as Elector of Hanover, again&s;t the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, again&s;t Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, the Count of Lippe Buckebourg, and in general again&s;t all the Adherence to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, threatening them with Penalties indignity, per&s;on and e&s;tate. In con|&s;equence of this decree, letters avocatory were i&s;&s;ued, no|tifying to the &s;overeign Princes, that if they did not within a limited time di&s;per&s;e their armies, break off their con|nection with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, pay their quota of Roman months, and &s;end their contingents to the army of execution, they were to be put under the ban of the Empire. To all other per&s;ons who held any dignity in the Empire, orders were given and penalties were threatened &s;uitable to their condition. They in &s;hort went all lengths, but that of actually and formally putting them under the ban, which they would not have failed to do, if their &s;ucce&s;s had an|&s;wered its beginnings. So little regard had the court of Vienna to former &s;ervices of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature; and &s;o entirely did &s;he &s;eem to forget that &s;he owed to the King of Great Britain, not only that power which &s;he now unju&s;tly and ungratefully turned again&s;t him, but al|mo&s;t the very being of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. So entirely
<PB N="69" REF="90">
did &s;he forget that this Monarch had expended his trea&s;ures, employed his armies, and even expo&s;ed his per&s;on in her cau&s;e, when it was not only abandoned, but attacked by almo&s;t all the re&s;t of Europe. However the violent pro|ceedings of the Aulic council, drew no one State or per&s;on from the Kings of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia; they rather had a contrary effect, in rou&s;ing the whole Evangelic body to a &s;en&s;e of their own danger. Much le&s;s were they able to &s;top the progre&s;s of the allied arms.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia conducted his retreat out of Bohe|mia in admirable order. The Generals Jahnus and Laudohn for &s;everal days hung upon his rear with two &s;trong bodies. They took advantageous po&s;ts, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, &s;ome|times on the other, &s;ometimes together, &s;ometimes &s;epa|rately, and threw all po&s;&s;ibly impediments in his way. But the vigour of the Pru&s;&s;ians drove them with lo&s;s from every po&s;t. So that by the 6th of Augu&s;t, they were obliged entirely to de&s;i&s;t from their pur&s;uit. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia freed from all mole&s;tation, marched with the utmo&s;t diligence by Wi&s;oca, Politz, Land&s;hut, and arrived on the 20th at Franckfort on the Oder. Here he joined the troops under Count Dohna. The army was now in a condi|tion to act,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 22."> 

 and they did not lo&s;e a moment's time to march again&s;t the enemy. All their vigour and expedition was not more than nece&s;&s;ary. The Ru&s;&s;ians had be&s;ieged Cu&s;trin from the 15th. Though the&s;e people &s;carcely emerged from barbari&s;m, had not the mo&s;t perfect &s;kill in operations of this nature, they &s;upplied that deficien|cy by a fero&s;ity that &s;crupled nothing, by numbers who&s;e lives they did not regard, and by a mo&s;t formidable artillery, which rudely but furiou&s;ly managed, only &s;pread the more general and indi&s;criminate de&s;truction. In effect, they threw &s;uch a multitude of bombs and red hot balls into that unfortunate city, that in a &s;hort time it was on fire in every quarter. Of the wretched inhabitants &s;ome were burned, &s;ome buried in the ruins, &s;ome killed by the balls that fell like hail in the &s;treets: the &s;urviving majority &s;afe neither within nor without their hou&s;es, abandoned their homes and their &s;ub&s;tance, and fled, many of them almo&s;t naked, out of the &s;ide which was not inve&s;ted. Never was beheld a more deplorable &s;pectacle; nor was it ea&s;y to &s;ay which formed the more wretched appearance, tho&s;e who peri&s;hed, or tho&s;e who e&s;caped. Mean while the Governor firm in
<PB N="70" REF="91">
his courage and fidelity, did every thing for the defence of the walls and ruins of the place; but the walls built in the old manner did not promi&s;e a &s;ucce&s;sful defence; the enemy had po&s;ted them&s;elves in the &s;uburbs, and in the firing of the town, the principal magazine of the be&s;ieged was blown up.</P>
<P>The protector and avenger of his dominions, was now however at hand. On the 23th, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's whole army pa&s;&s;ed the Oder at Glu&s;tebi&s;&s;el, about twenty Engli&s;h miles to the north-ea&s;t of Cu&s;trin. The Ru&s;&s;ians on the fir&s;t notice of his approach, broke up the &s;iege of that place, and marched towards the villages of Zwicker and Zorn|dorff. It was the King's intention to wind round the left flank of their army, and to take them in the rear, by which he hoped to throw them into confu&s;ion. But in this he found him&s;elf di&s;appointed. The Ru&s;&s;ian Generals had fore&s;een his purpo&s;e and made excellent di&s;po&s;itions. As the ground did not admit them to extend greatly in length, they threw them&s;elves into a &s;quare body compo&s;ed of four lines, forming a front almo&s;t equal on every &s;ide, and on every &s;ide &s;urrounded by cannon and chevaux de frize. In this formidable di&s;po&s;ition they waited the attack of the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>It was on the 25th of Augu&s;t that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after a march of 56 days, from the mid&s;t of Moravia, brought his army in pre&s;ence of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The King had never been per&s;onally engaged with that enemy before. His troops had never obtained any advantage over them. The whole fortune of the war depended upon the event of this day. The Pru&s;&s;ians were now in the clo&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;e to fight for their country, which was ready to fall under one of the &s;evere&s;t &s;courges with which Providence has cha&s;ti&s;ed a nation. Nothing was wanting which could in&s;pire the &s;oldiers with revenge. Every where the marks of the enemies cruelty were before their eyes; the country de&s;o|lated on every &s;ide, and the villages in flames all round the field of battle.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock in the morning the battle began by a fire of cannon and mortars which rained on the right wing of the Ru&s;&s;ians without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion for near two hours. Nothing could exceed the havock made by this terrible fire, nor the con&s;tancy with which the Mu&s;covite foot, raw and unexperienced, &s;u&s;tained a &s;laughter that
<PB N="71" REF="92">
would have confounded and di&s;per&s;ed the compleate&s;t vete|rans. They fell in their ranks; new regiments &s;till pre&s;&s;ed forward to fill their places, and to &s;upply new &s;laughter. When the fir&s;t line had fired away all their charges, they ru&s;hed forward on the Pru&s;&s;ians. That firm body of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry which had often &s;tood, and often given &s;o many terrible &s;hocks, by one of tho&s;e unaccountable move|ments of the human mind, that render every thing in war &s;o precarious, gave way in the pre&s;ence of their Sovereign, and when they had in a manner &s;ecured the victory, retired in di&s;order before the half broken battalions of the Mu&s;co|vites. Had the Ru&s;&s;ian officers known how to profit of this di&s;order; had they immediately thrown in their hor&s;e with vigour to compleat it, and entirely break that body; this had probably been the la&s;t day of the Pru&s;&s;ian greatne&s;s. The King was not &s;o negligent. For ju&s;t in this anxious moment, whil&s;t the battle was yet in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, by a very rapid and ma&s;terly motion, he brought all the cavalry of his right to the centre, with which General Sedlitz at their head, bur&s;ting in upon the Ru&s;&s;ian foot, uncovered by their hor&s;e, and di&s;ordered even by their advantage, they pu&s;hed them back, with a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;laughter. The repul&s;ed battalions of Pru&s;&s;ia had time to recollect, and to form them&s;elves; and now returning to the on&s;et with a rage exa&s;perated by their late di&s;grace, they entirely turned the ballance of the fight. The Ru&s;&s;ians were thrown into the mo&s;t horrid confu&s;ion. The wind blew the du&s;t and &s;moke full in their faces. They no longer di&s;tingui&s;hed friends or enemies. They fired upon each other. In this di&s;traction they plundered their own baggage which &s;tood between the lines, and intoxicated them&s;elves with brandy. Orders were now no more heard nor obeyed. The ranks fell in upon one another; and being crammed together in a narrow &s;pace, every &s;hot di&s;charged by the Pru&s;&s;ians had its full effect: whil&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians kept up only a &s;cattered fire, without direction or effect, and quite over the heads of their enemies. It was now no longer battle, but a horrid and undi&s;tingui&s;hed carnage. Yet &s;till, (which is a wonderful circum&s;tance) the Ru&s;&s;ians thus di&s;tracted and &s;laughtered, kept their ground. The action continued without inter|mi&s;&s;ion from nine in the morning until &s;even at night. At la&s;t the night it&s;elf, the fatigue of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and a judi|cious attack on their right wing, which drew their attention
<PB N="72" REF="93">
on that &s;ide, gave the Ru&s;&s;ian army &s;ome re&s;pite to recover their order, and an opportunity of retiring a little from the &s;cene of their di&s;a&s;ter. On their &s;ide near 10,000 fell upon the &s;pot, they had more than 10,000 wounded, mo&s;t of them mortally: 939 officers, not including the inferior, were killed, wounded, and taken pri&s;oners; of two particular re|giments con&s;i&s;ting before the battle of 4595 effective men, only 1475 were left; their whole lo&s;s on this bloody day way 21,529 men. That of the Pru&s;&s;ians in every way did not amount to 2000.</P>
<P>The Gazettes of both parties warmly di&s;puted the vain honour of the field of battle. On the mo&s;t diligent en|quiry, it appears that both parties &s;pent the night on or very near the place of action. But this is an affair of little con|&s;equence. The Pru&s;&s;ians had all the fruits, and mo&s;t of the proofs of a victory the mo&s;t complete and deci&s;ive. A va&s;t train of artillery taken, the military che&s;t, a number of pri&s;oners, many of them officers of high rank; the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, the next and the following days; their General Fermor's reque&s;t for leave to bury the dead; their incapacity to advance or form any new enterpri&s;e; the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's unmole&s;ted operations again&s;t his other enemies; all the&s;e form the mo&s;t clear and certain demon&s;tration of a victory in all the points, for which a victory is de&s;irable.</P>
<P>Nothing le&s;s indeed, than a very complete victory could have done any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the King's affair at that time, when four armies of his enemies were making their way to one common centre, and threatened to unite in the heart of Brandenburg. The King renewed the attack on the Ru&s;&s;ians the next morning. The event of the la&s;t day had &s;hewed them, that there was no way of &s;afety but in a retreat, and in effect they retreated before the Pru&s;&s;ians as far as Land&s;perg on the frontiers of Poland. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was convinced that their late check mu&s;t wholly di&s;|able them from attempting any thing material again&s;t his dominions on that &s;ide; and he &s;aw clearly that whatever he might hope to gain by improving his advantage again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, he mu&s;t lo&s;e far, more by allowing his other enemies to make a progre&s;s on the &s;ide of Saxony. He &s;atisfied him&s;elf therefore with leaving a &s;mall body of troops under Count Dohna, to ob&s;erve the motions of the Mu&s;covite army; and marched with the greate&s;t part of his
<PB N="73" REF="94">
forces and the utmo&s;t expedition to the relief of Prince Henry.</P>
<P>M. Daun having laid a&s;ide his fir&s;t project for pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe at Mei&s;&s;en, enterpri&s;ed nothing new on the &s;ide of Saxony for &s;ome days; he contented him&s;elf with taking a po&s;ition at Stolpen to the Ea&s;tward of the Elbe, by which, whil&s;t he pre&s;erved to him&s;elf an ea&s;y communication with the army of the Empire, he interrupted the communication between Bautzen and Dre&s;den; he favoured the operations of General Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Lu&s;atia to the confines of Brandenburgh; and by drawing the attention of the Pru&s;&s;ian forces which were left in Si|le&s;ia to the northward of that dutchy, he facilitated the progre&s;s of the Generals Harach and de Ville in the &s;outhern parts. Admirable di&s;po&s;itions without que&s;tion, if the time had not called for more vigorous mea&s;ures, and if the re&s;cue of Saxony from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had not been the great object of the campaign! It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the court of Vienna had &s;till &s;uch an hankering after Sile&s;ia, as in|duced them to &s;laken their efforts on the &s;ide of Saxony, in hopes, that if M. Daun could protract the operations there, &s;o as to find full employment for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, their other forces might reduce Sile&s;ia with great facility; and thus perhaps by aiming at two &s;uch difficult objects at once, as it generally happens, they lo&s;t them both. Upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition, it is not very ea&s;y to account for the &s;eeming inactivity of M. Daun, whil&s;t he had &s;o fair a game in his hands. However advantageou&s;ly Prince Henry might have cho&s;en his po&s;t, or however &s;trongly he might have &s;ecured it, yet the prodigious &s;uperiority of the com|bined armies &s;eems to have more than over-balanced that advantage, and to have ju&s;tified, nay to have demanded &s;ome bold and deci&s;ive attempt.</P>
<P>In fact, this appeared at length to be the Mar&s;hal's own opinion. For when the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of Sonne&s;tein mo&s;t unaccountably &s;urrendered, with a garri&s;on of 1400 men, to the Au&s;trian General Mac-Guire after the re&s;i&s;|tance of no more than a &s;ingle day;

towards Dre&s;den. This was to bring matters to a &s;peedy deci&s;ion. But now the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by the mo&s;t rapid marches had reached the frontiers of Saxony. The whole de&s;ign was di&s;concerted; and far from being able to di&s;lodge Prince Henry, they found them&s;elves utterly unable to pre|vent the King his brother from joining him, with his whole army.

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 11."> 

 On his approach General Laudohn abandoned his advantages in the Lower Lu&s;atia, and fell back upon M. Daun; who him&s;elf retired from the neighbourhood of Dre&s;den and fell back as far as Zittau. The army of the Empire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;trong po&s;t of Pirna, which the Saxons had occupied in the begin|ning of the war, kept their ground; but did not undertake any thing. Thus in fifteen days the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by his unparallelled &s;pirit, diligence and magnanimity, fought and defeated a &s;uperior body of his enemies, in one extre|mity of his dominions, and baffled without fighting another &s;uperior body in the other extremity.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages, glorious as they were, were not the only ones which followed the victory at Zorndorf. The Swedes who directed their motions by tho&s;e of their Ru&s;&s;ian allies, ha&s;tened their operations when that army had ad|vanced into Brandenburgh. General Wedel was detached from Saxony, to &s;top their progre&s;s; and the Prince of Be|vern, now Governor of Stettin, gave them &s;ome oppo&s;ition. All this, however, had proved ineffectual, if the news of the defeat of the Ru&s;&s;ians had not alarmed the Swedes in &s;uch a manner, as to make them return with more expedi|tion than they had advanced. Tho' the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs began to put on a better appearance by the&s;e efforts, the fortune of the war &s;till hung in a very dubious &s;cale. The enemy was &s;till &s;uperior. The Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;till &s;ome footing in his dominions. The Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts were yet in Saxony; and if the King's armies had it in their power to take &s;trong &s;ituations; the enemy had the &s;ame advantages. The condition of things was ex|tremely critical, and the lea&s;t error or misfortune threat|ened &s;till to plunge the King of Pru&s;&s;ia into an aby&s;s of calamities.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE operations of the armies in We&s;tphalia, &s;eemed for a long time to langui&s;h. The grand army of the French under M. de Contades, was wholly unable to drive Prince Ferdinand from the po&s;ts which he had cho&s;en &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly along the Lippe. The other divi&s;ion of the French forces under the Prince de Soubi&s;e, had made no great pro|gre&s;s on the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;tle, again&s;t the Prince I&s;enburg, who &s;till kept his ground in that principality, in order to protect the cour&s;e of the We&s;er, and to cover the electo|rate. The French were &s;en&s;ible that an attack on the prin|cipal army of the allies, would prove a very dangerous at|tempt, in which even if they &s;hould have &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, their progre&s;s into the King's electoral dominions mu&s;t be very &s;low and difficult. But as the Body of the allies em|ployed in He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;tle was far the weake&s;t, and as an ad|vantage on that &s;ide promi&s;ed them the command of the We&s;er, and a better pa&s;&s;age into the heart of the enemies country, they determined to make an attempt there. To further this de&s;ign, a con&s;iderable detachment was made from the army of M. de Contades, which increa&s;ed the Prince of Soubi&s;e's corps to at lea&s;t 30,000 men. Prince Ferdinand, who was &s;ufficiently aware of the enemies plan, had &s;ome time before &s;ent General Oberg with a &s;trong reinforcement to join the Prince I&s;enburg; but notwith|&s;tanding this reinforcement, the whole force of the allies in He&s;&s;e did not exceed 15000. This body was attacked by the French at Lanwerenhagen, and their great &s;uperiority, e&s;pecially in point of cavalry,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 30."> 

 obliged the allies to retire with the lo&s;s of about 1500 men. The allies unable to keep the field, had however &s;ome woods in their rear which covered their retreat, and they pre&s;erved &s;o good a countenance as prevented their defeat from becoming total.</P>

<P><PB N="76" REF="101">Great con&s;equences might have been apprehended from this affair. But the vigilance of Prince Ferdinand, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t ready communications all along the Lippe, &s;uffered the victorious army to reap but little ad|vantage from their victory. That accompli&s;hed General ad|vanced with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mo&s;t expedition towards Rheda, and the P. I&s;enburgh having fallen back upon him, they joined in &s;uch a manner as perfectly to &s;ecure the We&s;er, without lo&s;ing any thing on the &s;ide of the Rhine. And although the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary motions, in &s;ome &s;ort uncovered the electorate, &s;o as to lay it open to the incur&s;ions of the enemies light troops, who penetrated even to the gates of Hanover; yet the French were not in a condition to e&s;tabli&s;h any con&s;i|derable body, or to take any po&s;t of moment in that part.</P>
<P>During this time, the armies of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and M. Daun, made no very remarkable movements. The Mar&s;hal kept his advantageous camp at Stolpen, by which he pre&s;erved a communication with the army of the Em|pire. The army was &s;ecured by its inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, but it enterpri&s;ed nothing of con&s;equence. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia on the other hand, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important po&s;t of Bautzen, which lies &s;o opportunely for commanding at once both Mi&s;nia and Lu&s;atia, extended his right wing to Hochkirchen. By this po&s;ition he pre&s;erved a communication with the army of his brother prince Henry, he protected Brandenburg from the incur&s;ions of the Au&s;|trians, and at the &s;ame time that he &s;ecured the&s;e intere&s;t|ing objects, he was better &s;ituated for throwing &s;uccours into Sile&s;ia, than he could be any where el&s;e con&s;i&s;tently with his general plan. The two armies kept the mo&s;t watchful eye upon each others motions. The principal aim of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;eemed to have been the preventing M. Daun from communicating with Bohemia. The great intention of M. Daun was to cut off the King from Sile&s;ia. Things were &s;o ballanced, that it did not &s;eem po&s;&s;ible by mere &s;kill in marches and po&s;itions to an&s;wer the&s;e ends very fully: therefore a battle &s;eemed inevitable. But it &s;eemed too that con&s;idering the &s;ituation of both armies, a battle could not be attempted without extreme danger to the party who &s;hould begin the attack.</P>
<P>M. Daun &s;aw that if any more time was lo&s;t without action, the very &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t oblige him to evacuate Saxony, and thus give up all the fruits of the campaign. He came
<PB N="77" REF="102">
to a re&s;olution of giving the King of Pru&s;&s;ia Battle. But even in the vigour of this re&s;olution, appeared the extreme caution which characteri&s;es that able General. Having communicated his de&s;ign to the prince of Deux-Ponts, and &s;ettled mea&s;ures with him, he marched in the dead of a very dark night, in three columns, towards the right of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's camp. Notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s of the night, notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ary divi&s;ion of the Au&s;trian army,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 14."> 

 the greatne&s;s of their num|bers, and the length of way they had to march, yet &s;uch was the wi&s;e conduct and great good fortune of this de&s;ign, that they all arrived at the &s;ame time at the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, none having lo&s;t their way, without di&s;co|very, without confu&s;ion, and began the attack with the utmo&s;t regularity and re&s;olution at five o'clock in the morn|ing.</P>
<P>How the King's out-guards were kept &s;o as to make &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;e practicable, is hard to &s;ay. It is hard to accu&s;e the vigilance of &s;o able a commander, or the attention of &s;o many fini&s;hed officers as &s;erved under him. To &s;peak of treachery is a way of accounting for misfortunes, more common than rea&s;onable. However it was, the Pru&s;&s;ians had not time to &s;trike their tents, when they found the enemy in the mid&s;t of the camp, and an impetuous attack already begun. Scarce had the battle begun, when a de|feat &s;eemed certain; not &s;o much from the confu&s;ion of the troops, as the irreparable lo&s;s of two officers in the highe&s;t command, and of the greate&s;t merit. M. Keith received two mu&s;quet balls, and fell dead upon the &s;pot. Prince Francis of Brun&s;wick had his head &s;hot off by a cannon ball as he mounted his hor&s;e. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had then the whole of affairs to &s;u&s;tain alone, at the time when he mo&s;t wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But his pre&s;ence of mind, his firmne&s;s, his activity, remedied in &s;ome mea&s;ure the ef|fects of this unfor&s;een attack, and the lo&s;&s;es and di&s;orders it had occa&s;ioned; he was every where pre&s;ent, and in&s;pi|red his troops with an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dor like his own. The King or|dered &s;ome detachments from his left, to reinforce his right wing; but in the moment the orders were received, the left it&s;elf was furiou&s;ly attacked. General Retzow who commanded in that quarter, with difficulty repul&s;ed the Au&s;trians, and was not able to afford any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
<PB N="78" REF="103">
to the right, which was alone obliged to &s;upport the whole weight of the grand attack.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians in the beginning of the engagement had beaten them out of the village of Hochkirchen; as the fate of the day depended upon that po&s;t, the hotte&s;t of the di&s;|pute was there. The Pru&s;&s;ians made three bloody and un|&s;ucce&s;sful attacks on the village; on the fourth they carried it; but the Au&s;trians pouring continually fre&s;h troops upon that &s;pot, drove them out at length after reiterated efforts, and a prodigious &s;laughter on all &s;ides. Then the King de&s;pairing of the fortune of that field, ordered a retreat: his troops, which had been &s;uddenly attacked in a dark night by &s;uperior numbers, and had run to arms &s;ome half naked, and all in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, had, notwith&s;tand|ing, made a mo&s;t vigorous re&s;i&s;tance; and maintained the fight for near five hours. They made their retreat in good order without being pur&s;ued, &s;upported by the good coun|tenance of their cavalry, and the fire of the numerous and well &s;erved artillery, which was placed in the centre of their camp. They lo&s;t in this bloody action at lea&s;t 7000 men, killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, together with many cannon. The Au&s;trian account allowed their own lo&s;s in killed and wounded to amount to near 5000.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in retiring from Hochkirchen, in fact only altered the po&s;ition of his right wing, which fell back as far as Wei&s;&s;enberg. His left &s;till remained at Baut|zen. This po&s;ition was nearly as good as the former. The great lo&s;s was the lo&s;s of reputation, which always attends a defeat, and the lo&s;s of two great generals which attended this in particular. M. Keith was a Scochman born. He engaged with his brother the Lord Mar&s;hal in the Rebellion of 1715. Being obliged to relinqui&s;h his country on this occa&s;ion, he entered into the troops of Spain, and after|wards pa&s;&s;ing into Ru&s;&s;ia, he obtained a con&s;iderable com|mand, and performed many &s;ignal &s;ervices in their wars with Turkey and Sweden; and &s;erved them al&s;o in peace by &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies. But finding the honours of that country no better than a &s;plendid &s;ervitude, and not meeting with tho&s;e rewards, which his long and faithful &s;ervices de&s;erved, he left that court for one where merit is better known and better rewarded: and having been employed &s;ince the be|ginning of the war in a di&s;tingui&s;hed command in the King
<PB N="79" REF="104">
of Pru&s;&s;ia's armies, he fell at la&s;t in a &s;ervice that was wor|thy of him.</P>
<P>If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia lo&s;t &s;ome reputation in &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed in this affair; he fully retrieved it by his extraordinary conduct in the cour&s;e of the action, and his admirable efforts after it. On the whole, perhaps, when all circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia will appear greater in this defeat, than in any victory he ever yet obtained. The wing of his army that was attack|ed, was &s;urpri&s;ed at a di&s;tance from him, the two Generals that commanded it &s;lain in the fir&s;t on&s;et, his other princi|pal Generals wounded, the whole wing in confu&s;ion with|out a leader; to come, in the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, in ha&s;te from another quarter; to recover all; twice to re|pul&s;e the enemy, and at la&s;t to retire, overborne only by numbers and fatigue, without being pur&s;ued, is &s;uch an in&s;tance of great General&s;hip, as perhaps has never been exceeded.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing in Saxony, the Ru&s;&s;ians made no farther attempts on the Side of Brandenburgh; they remained in their camp near Land&s;perg, until the 21&s;t of September; when after &s;everal feigned motions, made to cover their real de&s;ign, they began their retreat towards Pomerania, where they arrived on the 26th.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould keep their ground in that province during the winter, unle&s;s they could &s;ecure &s;ome &s;ea-port, from whence they might be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The little town of Colberg was very opportune for that purpo&s;e, as it is a &s;ea-port on the Baltick, and &s;o meanly fortified, that the reduction of it appeared to be as ea&s;y as expedient. On the third of October, they formed the &s;iege of this incon&s;iderable place, with a body of 15000 men. But &s;uch was the bravery of Major Heydon the Governor; and &s;uch the incapacity of the Ru&s;&s;ians for ope|rations of this nature, that this little town, defended only by a rampart, without any outwork, and lined with a very feeble garri&s;on, held out again&s;t the repeated attacks of the enemy twenty-&s;ix days,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 29."> 

 and then obliged them to rai&s;e the &s;iege, without any &s;uccours what&s;oever from without. This was the la&s;t enterpri&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ians. Their va&s;t army retired with di&s;grace, fir&s;t from Branden|burgh, and then from Pomerania; not being able to ma&s;ter one place of &s;trength in either country; but having de|&s;troyed
<PB N="80" REF="105">
with the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarity both the open towns and defencele&s;s villages; leaving as &s;trong impre&s;&s;i|ons of contempt for their incapacity, as of horror for their cruelty.</P>
<P>After the defeat which the King received at Hochkirchen, he omitted no mea&s;ures to prevent the enemy from making any material advantage of it. He perceived clearly, that the advantage they propo&s;ed to derive from it, was to cover the operations of their armies in Sile&s;ia; and that they had no longer any &s;erious de&s;ign upon Saxony during this campaign. The King therefore, made no &s;cruple to rein|force his army by con&s;iderable detachments from that of Prince Henry, which were brought up by that Prince him|&s;elf. And as he &s;aw that Nei&s;s, the &s;iege of which had been already formed and pro&s;ecuted with great vigour, mu&s;t certainly &s;urrender if it were not &s;peedily &s;uccoured, he re&s;olved to march into Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>To the execution of this de&s;ign, the greate&s;t difficulties &s;tarted up on all &s;ides. The army of M. Daun, lately vic|torious, had no other bu&s;ine&s;s than to intercept him. To fight was dubious; to avoid it hard. If he could even avoid a battle, he had much to apprehend from the efforts of the enemy to harra&s;s him on his march. If he &s;hould be &s;o happy as to e&s;cape or conquer the&s;e difficulties, yet his march entirely uncovered Saxony, and abandoned that mo&s;t intere&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, very poorly defended, to all the force of two powerful armies.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the con&s;ideration of Saxony &s;hould detain him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, Sile&s;ia ran the &s;ame ri&s;que, and the &s;ame or greater di&s;advantages mu&s;t en&s;ue to his af|fairs, by &s;uffering the Au&s;trians to obtain a footing there. This dilemma, which would have rendered a meaner genius entirely inactive&punc; and hindered him from taking any re&s;o|lution, only obliged the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to take his re&s;o|lution with the greater &s;peed, and to execute it with the greater vigour.</P>
<P>On the 24th of November at night, he quitted his camp at Dobre&s;chutz, and making a great compa&s;s he arrived, without any ob&s;truction from the enemy, in the plain of Gorlitz. A body of the Au&s;trians had in vain endeavoured to &s;ecure this po&s;t before him; tho&s;e that arrived were de|feated, with the lo&s;s of 800 men. By this happy march, all the advantages of M. Daun's &s;tudied po&s;ition, of all the
<PB N="81" REF="106">
fruits his boa&s;ted victory at Hochkirchen, were lo&s;t in a moment, and an open pa&s;&s;age to Sile&s;ia lay before the King. He pur&s;ued his march with the greate&s;t diligence. General Laudohn, with 24,000 men was &s;ent to pur&s;ue him. That active general continually harra&s;&s;ed his rear guard; but the King continued his march without interruption, and &s;uffer|ed him to take many little advantages, rather than by de|laying to conte&s;t &s;mall matters, to endanger a de&s;ign, which might be deci&s;ive of the whole campaign.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Daun, not content with the ob&s;ta|cles which General Laudohn threw in the King's way, &s;ent a large body of hor&s;e and foot by another route to reinforce the army which under the Generals Har&s;ch and De Ville had formed the &s;iege of Nei&s;s, and the blockade of Co&s;el. But he perceived that all the&s;e mea&s;ures would probably prove ineffectual, as his principal project, which was to cover Sile&s;ia, had been defeated. He therefore turned his views towards Saxony, and &s;atisfying him&s;elf with detaching Ge|neral Laudohn, which might create an opinion that the whole Au&s;trian army pur&s;ued, he followed the King no further than Gorlitz; which place he immediately quitted, and having by forced marches gained the Elbe, he pa&s;&s;ed that river at Pirna,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 6."> 

 and advanced towards Dre&s;den. At the &s;ame time the army of the Em|pire, by its motions having obliged the Pru&s;&s;ian army then extremely weakened by the detachments that had been drawn from it, to retire from its po&s;t before Dre&s;den, &s;ome miles to the we&s;tward of that city, cut off their communi|cation with Leip&s;ic, whil&s;t M. Daun attempted to cut off their communication with Dre&s;den; but they found means to throw them&s;elves into that city, and afterwards to retire to the other &s;ide of the Elbe. The Au&s;trians and Imperial|i&s;ts began at once to inve&s;t tho&s;e two important places; another party advanced towards Torgau, an attempted that town. It &s;eemed utterly impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the Au&s;trians from becoming ma&s;ters of Saxony, who in a man|ner covered the whole country with their forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia drew nearer and nearer to Nei&s;s. The &s;iege of that fortre&s;s was commenced on the 4th of Augu&s;t; on the 3d of October it was com|pletely inve&s;ted; and the place was pu&s;hed on one &s;ide with the greate&s;t vigour, and on the other maintained with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate &s;kill and bravery, until the approach of

the King of Pru&s;&s;ia obliged the Au&s;trians, on the 1&s;t. of November, to rai&s;e the &s;iege, leaving a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores behind them. The &s;ame terror obliged the parties employed in the blockade of Co&s;el, to leave that place at liberty, and to fall back, together with the armies of the Generals Har&s;ch and De Ville, into Bohemia, and the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he had thus by the report of his march, without fighting, driven his enemies out of Sile&s;ia,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 9."> 

 lo&s;t not a moment to return by the &s;ame route, and with the &s;ame expedition to the relief of Saxony. Two bodies of his troops had moved for the &s;ame purpo&s;e out of Pomerania, one under Count Doh|na, and one under General Wedel. The corps under We|del had thrown it&s;elf into T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgau, repul&s;ed the Au&s;trians, who had attempted that place, and pur&s;ued them as far as Eulenbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. The grand operation of the Au&s;trians was again&s;t Dre&s;den. M. Daun, with an army of 60,000 men, came before that city, on the very Day on which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia began his march to oppo&s;e him, &s;o that he might well imagine his &s;ucce&s;s certain again&s;t a place meanly for|tified, and defended only by 12,000 men. The &s;ame day he began to cannonade it, and his light troops, &s;upported by the grenadiers of the army, made a &s;harp attack upon the &s;uburbs. The Governor, Count Schmettau, &s;aw that from the weakne&s;s of the &s;uburbs it would prove impo&s;&s;ible for him to prevent the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of them by a <HI>coup de main,</HI> and if they &s;ucceeded in this at|tempt, the great height of the Hou&s;es, being &s;ix or &s;even &s;tories, and entirely commanding the ramparts, would ren|der the reduction of the body of the place equally ea&s;y and certain. The&s;e con&s;iderations determined him to &s;et the&s;e &s;uburbs on fire.</P>
<P>It is well known that the &s;uburbs of Dre&s;den compo&s;e one of the fine&s;t towns in Europe, and are greatly &s;uperior to that which lies within the walls. Here the mo&s;t wealthy parts of the Inhabitants re&s;ide, and here are carried on tho&s;e &s;everal curious manufactures for which Dre&s;den is &s;o fa|mous. Count Daun fore&s;aw this con&s;equence of his at|tempt. He endeavoured to intimidate the Governor from this mea&s;ure, to which he knew the cruel rea&s;on of war would naturally lead him, by threatening to make him per|&s;onally an&s;werable for the &s;teps he &s;hould take; but Count

Schmettau an&s;wered with the firmne&s;s that became a man of honour and a &s;oldier, that he would an&s;wer whatever he &s;hould do, and would not only burn the &s;uburbs, in ca&s;e M. Daun advanced, but would likewi&s;e defend the city it|&s;elf &s;treet by &s;treet, and at la&s;t even the ca&s;tle, which was the royal re&s;idence, if he &s;hould be driven to it. When the magi&s;trates were appri&s;ed of this re&s;olution, they fell at the feet of Count Schmettau, and implored him to change his mind, and to have mercy on that devoted part of their city. The part of the royal family, who remained in Dre&s;|den, joined their &s;upplications to tho&s;e of the magi&s;trates; they prayed him to &s;pare that la&s;t refuge of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed royal|ty, and to allow at lea&s;t a &s;ecure re&s;idence to tho&s;e, who had been deprived of every thing el&s;e. All entreaties were vain. Schmettau continued firm in his re&s;olution. He told them that their &s;afety d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded on them&s;elves, and on M. Daun; that if he made no attempts, the &s;uburbs &s;hould be &s;till &s;ecure; but that if he took any farther &s;teps, the nece&s;&s;ity of his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, and his own honour, would compel him to act very di&s;agreeable to the lenity of his di&s;|po&s;ition. The magi&s;trates retired in de&s;pair. Combu&s;tibles were laid in all the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>At three a clock next morning,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 10."> 

 the &s;ignal for firing the &s;uburbs was given, and in a moment a place &s;o lately the &s;eat of ea&s;e and luxury, flouri&s;hing in traffick, in plea&s;ures and ingenious arts, was all in flames. A calamity &s;o dreadful needs no high colouring. However, as little mi&s;chief attended &s;uch a combu&s;tion, as the Nature of the thing could admit. Very few lo&s;t their lives; but many their whole &s;ub&s;tance. When this was done, the Pru&s;&s;ian troops abandoned the flaming &s;uburbs, and retired in good order into the city.</P>
<P>M. Daun &s;aw this fire, which, whil&s;t it laid wa&s;te the capital of his ally, made it more difficult for him to force it, he &s;ent in &s;ome empty threats to the Governor. But the Saxon mini&s;ter at Rati&s;bon, made grievous complaints to the Diet, of what he repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t unparalleled act of wanton and unprovoked cruelty, that had ever been committed. The emi&s;&s;aries of the court of Vienna &s;pread the &s;ame complaints; and they made no &s;cruple to invent, and to alter facts in &s;uch a manner as to move the greate&s;t pity towards the &s;ufferers, and the greate&s;t indignation again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. All the&s;e, however, were in
<PB N="84" REF="111">
a &s;hort time abundantly confuted, by the authentick certi|ficates of the magi&s;trates of Dre&s;den, and of tho&s;e officers of the court, who were perfectly acquainted with the tran&s;|action. By the&s;e certificates it appears, that only 250 hou&s;es were con&s;umed. Though this was a terrible cala|mity; it was nothing to the accounts given in the gazettes of the Au&s;trian faction. By the&s;e certificates it appears al&s;o, that the people were not &s;urpri&s;ed, but had &s;ufficient notice of the Governor's intentions, to enable them to provide for their &s;afety. In a word, all the charges of cruelty again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian commander, and &s;oldiery were fully overthrown.</P>
<P>This fire made a <HI>coup de main</HI> impracticable; regular operations demanded time, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was now in full march towards Saxony. M. Daun retired from before the place on the 17th. The King, after cro&s;&s;ing Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe, and joyning his troops under Count Dohna and General Wedel, arrived triumphantly at Dre&s;den on the 20th. The armies of M. Daun and the Empire gave way towards Bohemia, into which kingdom they &s;oon after finally retreated, without enterpri&s;ing any thing further. Six &s;ieges were rai&s;ed almo&s;t at the &s;ame time; that of Colberg, carried on by General Palmbach, under the orders of Mar&s;hal Fermor; that of Nei&s;s by M. de Har&s;ch; that of Co&s;el; that of Dre&s;den by M. Daun; the blockade of Torgau by M. Haddick; and that of Leip&s;ick by the Prince of Deux-Ponts.</P>
<P>About the time that the Au&s;trians retired into winter quarters, the French did the &s;ame; and the Hanoverians permitted them to do it without mole&s;tation, the &s;ea&s;on be|ing too far advanced, and their army perhaps not of &s;uffi|cient &s;trength for offen&s;ive operations; and Prince Ferdi|nand kept the field no longer. The Briti&s;h troops had no occa&s;ion of &s;ignalizing their bravery this year; but without a battle the nation &s;uffered a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and was touched with a very deep and general &s;orrow. The Duke of Marlborough died in Mun&s;ter, the 20th of October, of a fever, contracted by the fatigues of the Campaign. Never did the nation lo&s;e in one man, a temper more candid and benevolent, manners more amiable and open, a more pri|mitive integrity, a more exalted genero&s;ity, a more warm and feeling heart. He left all the enjoyments, which an ample fortune and an high rank could be&s;tow in the publick
<PB N="85" REF="112">
eye; and which every milder virtue, every di&s;po&s;ition to make and to be made happy, could give in a dome&s;tic life: he left the&s;e for the &s;ervice of his country, and died for its defence, as he had lived for its ornament and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>If we compare the events of this year with tho&s;e of the la&s;t, we &s;hall find in the actions of the pre&s;ent year, perhaps &s;omething le&s;s of that a&s;toni&s;hing eclat; fewer battles; not &s;o many nor &s;o &s;triking revolutions of fortune; but we may di&s;cover upon all &s;ides far greater management, and a more &s;tudied and refined conduct; more artful movements, a more judicious choice of po&s;ts, more quick and vigorous marches. If in the la&s;t year, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was the hero of the imagination, he is this year the hero of the judgment; and we have, I think, rea&s;on to admire him upon ju&s;ter princi|ples. Obliged to evacuate Moravia, he throws him&s;elf into Bohemia, and executes a retreat with all the &s;pirit of an inva&s;ion. He marches more than an hundred miles through an enemy's country, followed and harra&s;&s;ed by large armies, who are unable to obtain any advantage over him. Gain|ing at length his own territories, he engages the va&s;t army of the Ru&s;&s;ians and defeats it. He is unable to follow his blow, but he di&s;ables them from &s;triking any again&s;t that part of his dominions, which he is obliged to leave. Whil&s;t he is engaged with the Ru&s;&s;ians on the frontiers of Poland, the Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts enter Saxony. Before they can do any thing deci&s;ive, the King is him&s;elf &s;uddenly in Saxony, and by his pre&s;ence, at once di&s;concerts all their projects. The &s;cene is again changed, they &s;urpri&s;e him in his camp at Hochkirchen, two of his Generals are killed, his army defeated, his camp is taken. They attack Sile&s;ia with a formidable army. Notwith&s;tanding his late defeat; notwith&s;tanding the great &s;uperiority of his enemies; not|with&s;tanding the advantage of their po&s;ts; he makes an amazing &s;weep about all their forces, eludes their vigilance, renders their po&s;itions unprofitable; and marching with an a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity into the remote&s;t parts of Sile&s;ia, obliges the Au&s;trian armies to retire with precipitation out of that province. Then he flies to the relief of Saxony, which his enemies had again profited of his ab&s;ence to in|vade; and again by the &s;ame rapid and well conducted march, he obliges them to abandon their prize. Defeated by the Au&s;trians he acquired by his conduct all the advan|tages
<PB N="86" REF="113">
to the mo&s;t compleat victory. He guarded all his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in &s;uch a manner, as to enable them all the endure his ab&s;ence for &s;ome &s;hort time; and he conducted his marches with &s;uch &s;pirit, as did not make it nece&s;&s;ary to them to hold out any longer; he made twice the circuit of his dominions, and in their turn he relieved them all.</P>
<P>Nor was the conduct of Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick le&s;s worthy of admiration. Placed at the Head of a body of troops, who were but lately obliged to lay down their arms, he found the enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole open country, and of all the &s;trong places in it. Commencing the campaign in the mid&s;t of a &s;evere winter, without any place of &s;trength in his hands, he drove the enemy from all tho&s;e they held. He obliged them to repa&s;s the Rhine, he followed and defeated them in a pitched battle. Being af|terwards obliged by the great force of France on its own frontier, and the numerous armies they had in different pla|ces, to repa&s;s the Rhine; he defended Lippe again&s;t num|bers greatly &s;uperior, and though they defeated a part of his army, they were not able to turn their victory to the lea&s;t advantage. Prince Ferdinand's campaign may well pa&s;s for a perfect model of defen&s;ive operations.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians, in taking winter quarters, di&s;po&s;ed their forces &s;o as to form a chain of an amazing length, from the frontiers of Moravia pa&s;&s;ing through Bohemia, all along the &s;kirts of Sile&s;ia and the borders of Saxony. There the Imperial army joined this chain, and continued it through Thuringia and Franconia, where it was united to the quar|ters of the Prince de Soubi&s;e. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e troops had fallen back from He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, finding them&s;elves unable to maintain their ground in the landgraviate. The Prince de Soubi&s;e's cantonments extended we&s;tward along the cour&s;e of the Maine and Lahn, to meet tho&s;e of the M. de Contades which &s;tretched to the Rhine, and continued the chain be|yond it quite to the Mae&s;e, &s;o as to command the whole cour&s;e of the Rhine, and both &s;ides both upwards and down|ward. Prince Ferdinand was unable to extend him&s;elf to &s;uch a length; and e&s;pecially found it impracticable to e&s;ta|bli&s;h quarters on the other &s;ide of the Rhine; but he di&s;|po&s;ed his troops in the mo&s;t advantageous manner in the bi&s;hoprics of Mun&s;ter, Paderborn, and Hilde&s;heim, and in the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. The &s;everal bodies may all unite with ea&s;e, and &s;upport each other. To pre|&s;erve

a communication between this and the Pru&s;&s;ian army, as well as to break &s;ome part of that formidable chain of the enemy, the King &s;ent &s;ome bodies of his troops into Thu|ringia, who di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the army of the Empire of &s;everal of their po&s;ts there, and they now threaten to penetrate &s;till farther.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he had a &s;econd time driven the Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts out of Saxony, re&s;olved to keep no mea&s;ures with that unhappy country. He declared that he was re&s;olved no longer to con&s;ider it as a depo&s;it, but as a country which he had twice &s;ubdued by his arms. He therefore ordered tho&s;e of the King of Poland's privy council, who &s;till remained at Dre&s;den, to retire at a very &s;hort warning. But if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had a right, as perhaps he had to con&s;ider Saxony as a lawful conque&s;t, he certainly &s;eemed not to con&s;ider the people as &s;ubjects, when he continued to exact the mo&s;t &s;evere contributions; and in a manner too, very little becoming a lawful &s;overeign; for he &s;urrounded the exchange with &s;oldiers, and confi|ning the merchants in narrow lodgings on &s;traw beds, he obliged them by extreme &s;uffering, to draw bills on their foreign corre&s;pondents for very large &s;ums. This city had been quite exhau&s;ted by former payments, and had not long before &s;uffered military execution. And enemy that acted thus, had acted &s;everely; but when a country is en|tirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any power, and claimed as a conque&s;t, the rights of war &s;eem to cea&s;e; and the people have a claim to be governed in &s;uch a manner as becomes a ju&s;t Prince; e&s;pecially when no extreme nece&s;&s;ity in his affairs compels him to the&s;e rigorous cour&s;es. To retaliate on the&s;e mi&s;e|rable people &s;ome part of the cruelties committed by the Ru&s;&s;ians on his dominions &s;eems to be very unrea&s;onable, as it is but too obvious, that the barbarity of that people could not be re&s;trained, however it might be exa&s;perated by the total de&s;truction of Saxony. Such retaliations are odious and cruel. We heartily wi&s;h we could prai&s;e the King of Pru&s;&s;ia as much for his temporate u&s;e of his con|que&s;t, as for tho&s;e wonderful and heroic qualities by which he obtained it. We might be con&s;idered as partial in our account, if we had omitted to take notice of what is alledg|ed again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when we have &s;poken &s;o fully of the outrages committed by his enemies.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the beginning of this year, the good condition of our navy and our army; the &s;pirit and popularity of the mini&s;try; the wi&s;e choice of commanders, in contempt of vulgar and trivial maxims; the prevalence of the contrary to all the&s;e among&s;t the enemy; gave us the be&s;t grounded hopes of a vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful campaign. Concerning the theatre of our operations there was &s;ome doubt. It was the opinion of &s;ome, that our pu&s;h in Europe &s;hould be made on the &s;ide of Germany; and that we ought to &s;trengthen the army of Prince Ferdinand with &s;uch a re|&s;pectable body of troops, as might enable that fini&s;hed com|mander to exert all his talents, and to improve to the utmo&s;t the advantages he had already obtained over the French. They imagined, that if an early and con&s;iderable reinforce|ment were &s;ent to the Prince, whil&s;t the French army was yet in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, and if in this condition that &s;hould receive any con&s;iderable blow, they would find it extremely difficult to retrieve it: and receiving this blow, on the frontier of their own territories, the Prince might carry the war into France it&s;elf; and thus very probably bring matters to a &s;peedy deci&s;ion. That in pur&s;uing this plan a diver&s;ion on the coa&s;t of France was by no means excluded: and that on the contrary it mu&s;t, on this plan, be attended with con&s;equences infinitely more important than it could otherwi&s;e; that otherwi&s;e, France might laugh at the little de&s;ultory efforts of an handful of men, who were to be embarked and di&s;-embarked with great dif|ficulty and hazard, and which would always be obliged to fly at the fir&s;t approach of an enemy. That whil&s;t the French had only an army, greatly inferior in number to en|gage on the &s;ide of Germany, they would always find them|&s;elves
<PB N="89" REF="116">
well able to act abroad, and defend them&s;elves at home.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was &s;trongly urged, that we ought to make the de&s;truction of the French marine our great object, and to con&s;ider all continental operations only in a &s;econdary light. That by &s;ending a large body of Engli&s;h troops to the King's army on the Rhine, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily weaken our efforts in America, and on the coa&s;t of France; and by drawing away all our forces, we mu&s;t &s;hake that internal &s;ecurity, which invigorated all our operations abroad. That whil&s;t we maintained an army of 50,000 foreigners in Germany, it would be the greate&s;t imprudence to &s;end al&s;o a large body of our own national troops into the &s;ame country, and by that means not only &s;quander away our men, but employ almo&s;t every penny granted for the Land &s;ervice, out of Great Britain; a method which could not fail of exhau&s;ting us in a very &s;hort time. That the force already in Germany was &s;ufficient to keep the French engaged, and that the propo&s;ed expeditions to France would, be attacking the coa&s;t, now in one part, now in another, and keeping all parts in continual alarms, nece&s;|&s;arily detain a very con&s;iderable part of their forces at home, and thus make a powerful diver&s;ion, whil&s;t it was pur&s;uing what ought to be the grand perpetual object of all our operations, the de&s;truction of the French maritime power.</P>
<P>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was however &s;o far modified by the arguments on the other &s;ide, that after &s;ome time a few regiments were &s;ent into Germany, as we have before related. The&s;e and better rea&s;ons, no doubt, determined the operations on the coa&s;t of France; but whil&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary preparations were making, their de&s;ti|nation was kept an inviolable &s;ecret; and now, as they had the year before, in&s;pired France with no little terror. Two &s;quadrons, by the latter end of May, were in readine&s;s for &s;ailing. The greater under Lord An&s;on, the &s;maller under Commodore Howe, which was &s;o de&s;igned to convoy the tran&s;ports, and to favour the landing and re-imbarkment. The land forces con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixteen battalions, and nine troops of light hor&s;e: they were commanded by the late Duke of Marlborough. They &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth: but as &s;oon as the fleet &s;et &s;ail,

 <MILESTONE N="June 1."> 

 the &s;quadron of my Lord An&s;on &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and bore off to the Bay of Bi&s;cay, in order to &s;pread the alarm more
<PB N="90" REF="117">
widely, and to ob&s;erve the French &s;quadron in Bre&s;t. The other part of the fleet, which was commanded by Commo|dore Howe, with the tran&s;ports, arrived without any acci|dent in Cancalle Bay, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the City of St. Maloes. Here the troops landed without op|po&s;ition,

 <MILESTONE N="5th."> 

 and having fortified a po&s;t near Cancalle (a po&s;t by nature well fitted for defence) for the &s;ecurity of their retreat, they marched in two columns to St. Maloes. When the army arrived there it was &s;oon vi|&s;ible, that the town, &s;trongly &s;ituated on a penin&s;ula, com|municating with the main land only by a long and narrow cau&s;eway, was by no means a proper object of a <HI>coup de main;</HI> and though for want of outworks, it was ill qualified to &s;u&s;tain a regular &s;iege; yet our forces were, for want of &s;trength and artillery &s;ufficient, altogether as ill qualified for &s;uch an operation. They were therefore contented with &s;etting fire to about an hundred &s;ail of &s;hipping many of them privateers,

 <MILESTONE N="8th."> 

 which lay under the cannon of the town, and to &s;everal magazines filled with naval &s;tores. The damage was very con&s;ider|able; yet, what is to be remarked, the enemy did not fire a &s;ingle &s;hot on the detachment employed in this &s;ervice. Having nothing more to do on this &s;ide, they retired to Cancalle; and reimbarked with as little oppo&s;ition as they met with at landing;

 <MILESTONE N="12th."> 

 the land and &s;ea com|manders having made all the di&s;po&s;itions with great judgment.</P>
<P>Before the fleet returned, they reconnoitred the town of Granville on the coa&s;t of Normandy; but finding that a large body of troops were encamped in the neighbourhood, they made no attempt there. From thence they moved to|wards Cherbourg, and made the proper di&s;po&s;itions for landing near that place; but a hard gale blowing into the &s;hore, and the tran&s;ports beginning to fall foul on each other, it became extremely hazardous to attempt landing. Be&s;ides, the provi&s;ion was near exhau&s;ted, and the &s;oldiers by being &s;o long cooped up in the tran&s;ports, were grown &s;ickly. It became highly nece&s;&s;ary to return home, and they arrived at St. Helen's on the 29th-of June.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, by which the French &s;uf|fered largely, with &s;carce any lo&s;s on our &s;ide, though it &s;ufficiently an&s;wered the intention of the armament, fell &s;omewhat &s;hort of the expectations of the public, who
<PB N="91" REF="118">
had formed much greater hopes, than it was po&s;&s;ible for the nature of &s;uch enterpri&s;es to fulfil. However, their hopes were again revived; by &s;eeing that every thing was prepared for another expedition, and that our armies and fleets were to be kept in con&s;tant action during the &s;ummer. The time was now come when we were to turn the tables upon France, and to retaliate by real attacks, the terrors which had been rai&s;ed by her menaces of an inva&s;ion. The Duke of Marlborough had now taken the command of the Engli&s;h forces in Germany; and General Bligh &s;ucceeded him in this command. Prince Edward re&s;olved to go upon the expedition, and to form him&s;elf for the &s;ervice of his country under &s;o brave and able a commander as Howe. It is ea&s;y to imagine, how much the &s;pirit, the pre&s;ence and example of the gallant young Prince, who went with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s through all the detail of a mid&s;hip|man's duty, in&s;pired both the &s;eamen and the troops.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, the fleet &s;et &s;ail from St. Helen's. In a few days they came to anchor before Cherbourg. The French had drawn a line &s;trengthened by forts, along the mo&s;t propable places for landing. They had drawn down three regiments of regular troops, and a con&s;iderable body of militia to the &s;hore, and had in all appearance threatened a very re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to the de&s;cent of the Engli&s;h forces. But the Commodore di&s;po&s;ed the men of war and bomb ketches &s;o judiciou&s;ly, and made &s;o &s;harp a fire upon the enemy, that they never ventured out of their entrenchments;

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 6."> 

 &s;o that the landing was effected in excellent order, and with very little lo&s;s. The French who made &s;o poor an oppo&s;ition to the landing, had &s;till many advantages from the nature of the ground which they occupied; but they neglected them all; and abandon|ing by a mo&s;t &s;hameful de&s;pair their forts and lines on the coa&s;t, they &s;uffered the Engli&s;h to enter Cherbourg the day after the landing, without throwing the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle in their way. It mu&s;t be remembered too, that the whole number of the Engli&s;h forces on this expedition was rather &s;hort of 6000 men.</P>
<P>Cherbourg is on the land &s;ide an open town; neither is it very &s;trongly defended towards the &s;ea. The harbour is naturally bad. But the place is well &s;ituated, in the mid&s;t of the channel, for protecting the French, and annoying the Engli&s;h commerce in time of war and perhaps for fa|cilitating
<PB N="92" REF="119">
an inva&s;ion on England it&s;elf. Mon&s;ieur Belidor the famous engineer, had demon&s;trated its importance, and propo&s;ed a plan for the improvement and defence of the harbour, as well as for the fortifications of the town. This plan was approved and partly put in execution by the build|ing of a mole, digging a ba&s;on and making &s;luices and flood gates with excellent materials and a va&s;t expence. The work had been for a con&s;iderable time di&s;continued; but in this expedition, that work of &s;o great ingenuity, charge, and labour, was totally de&s;troyed. Whil&s;t our humanity regrets the unhappy nece&s;&s;ity of war, we cannot help think|ing that the Engli&s;h nation was freed by the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, from what might one day be cau&s;e of no trivial alarms.</P>
<P>When this work of de&s;truction was over, all the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour burned, and ho&s;tages taken for the contribu|tions levied on the town, the forces reimbarked, with great &s;peed and &s;afety without any interrup|tion from the enemy,

 <MILESTONE N="16th."> 

 and with the &s;ame expedi|tion, care and conduct, as they had been fir&s;t landed; the army having continued ten days unmole&s;ted in France.</P>
<P>The Nation exulted greatly in this advantage, e&s;pecially as it almo&s;t accompanied the news of our glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es in America. Nothing was omitted to give the action its utmo&s;t eclat; the bra&s;s cannon and mortars taken at Cher|bourg, were drawn from Ken&s;ington to the tower, quite through the city, in great pomp and order, adorn|ed with &s;treamers,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 16."> 

 attended by guards, drums, mu&s;ic, and whatever el&s;e might draw the atten|tion of the vulgar. They who cen&s;ured this proce&s;&s;ion as too o&s;tentatious, did not con&s;ider, how forcibly things of this nature &s;trike upon ordinary minds, and how greatly they contribute to keep the people in good humour to &s;up|port the many charges and lo&s;&s;es that are incident to the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful war.</P>
<P>The fleet when it left Cherbourg, was driven to the coa&s;t of England; but the troops were not di&s;embarked; it was re&s;olved, that the coa&s;t of France &s;hould have no re&s;pite; and accordingly they &s;ailed towards St. Maloes, and landed in the bay of St. Lunar at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town of St. Maloes. This choice of a place for land|ing, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;urpri&s;ed all tho&s;e who remem|bered upon what rea&s;ons the attempt again&s;t that place had
<PB N="93" REF="120">
been &s;o recently laid a&s;ide. There was no other object of &s;ufficient con&s;ideration near it. The town was at lea&s;t in as good a po&s;ture of defence as it had been then; and the force which was to attack it had &s;ince then been con&s;ider|ably le&s;&s;ened. There is undoubtedly &s;omething very unac|countable as well in the choice as in the whole conduct of this affair. The per&s;ons in the principal commands, &s;hifted the blame from one to another. There is nothing more remote from our de&s;ign, than to &s;et up for judges in mat|ters of this nature; or ungenerou&s;ly to lean on any officer, who, meaning well to the &s;ervice of his country, by &s;ome misfortune or mi&s;take fails in &s;uch hazardous and intricate enterpri&s;es. We &s;hall be &s;atisfied with relating the facts as they happened.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the troops were landed in the bay of St. Lunar, it became evident that the de&s;ign again&s;t St. Maloes was utterly impracticable. Other projects were then pro|po&s;ed, but they all &s;eemed equally liable to objection. Whil&s;t they debated concerning a plan for their operations, the fleet was in the greate&s;t danger. The bay of St. Lunar is extremely rocky; and the experience of the people of the country, together with what he &s;aw him&s;elf, convinced the Commodore that it was impo&s;&s;ible to remain any longer in this road with tolerable &s;afety. Therefore he moved up to the bay of St. Cas, about three leagues to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>The fleet was &s;eparated from the land forces; but it was &s;till ea&s;y to pre&s;erve a communication between them; and as no attack was yet apprehended, they made no &s;cruple to penetrate farther into the country. In two days they arrived at the village of Matignon, having had &s;everal &s;kir|mi&s;hes with &s;mall bodies of the enemy, who from time to time appeared on their flanks, and who always di&s;appeared when they were bri&s;kly encountered. By this time the Duke d'Aiguillon, Governor of Britanny, was advanced within &s;ix miles of the Engli&s;h army, with a body of twelve battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons of regular troops, and two regiments of militia. This determined the council of war to retreat; they wanted but three miles to the bay of St. Cas. But in this little march a con&s;iderable time was con&s;umed, and the French army was clo&s;e upon them before they could be compleatly reimbarked. A very &s;teep hill formed a &s;ort of amphitheatre about the bay of St.
<PB N="94" REF="121">
Cas, where the embarkation was making; but before the la&s;t divi&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ted of all the grenadiers of the army, and the fir&s;t regiment of the guards, could get off, the French had marched down this hill, through an hol|low way, and formed them&s;elves in a long line again&s;t the few Engli&s;h troops that remained. There remained in this exigency only the expedient of a&s;&s;uming a bold countenance, and attacking them with vigour. The bra|very of our troops on this de&s;perate occa&s;ion, was wor|thy of a better fortune. The &s;hips and frigates &s;econded their efforts, and made a &s;evere fire upon the enemy. All was to no purpo&s;e; their ammunition was at la&s;t &s;pent; the enemies numbers prevailed; our little body attempted to retreat, but they fell into confu&s;ion, they broke, an horrible &s;laughter followed, many ran into the water and met their fate in that element. The &s;hore was covered with dead bodies. General Drury was drowned. Sir John Armitage, a young volunteer of great fortune and hopes, was &s;hot through the head. Several officers, men of large fortune and con&s;ideration fell. At length the firing of the frigates cea&s;ed, and the French immediately gave quarter. About 400 were made pri&s;oners, 600 were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this carnage, in the mid&s;t of a fire that &s;taggered the brave&s;t &s;eamen who managed the boats, Com|modore Howe exhibited a noble example of intrepidity and fortitude, by ordering him&s;elf to be rowed in his own boat through the thicke&s;t of the fire, to encourage all that were engaged in that &s;ervice, and to bring off as many men as his ve&s;&s;el could carry.</P>
<P>This affair di&s;pirited the people of England, and elated the people of France far more than an affair of &s;o little con&s;equence ought to have done. It was in fact no more than the cutting off a rear guard. There is often more blood&s;hed in &s;kirmi&s;hes in Germany, which make no figure in the Gazettes. And certainly, if our expeditions to the coa&s;t of France were planned with any judgment, on our part we had rather rea&s;on to congratulate our&s;elves that we were able to land three times on that coa&s;t, with &s;o in|con&s;iderable a lo&s;s. The French indeed had rea&s;on to mag|nify this lo&s;s; and they did greatly magnify it in order to con&s;ole their people, who had &s;een their trade &s;uffer &s;o much, and their country &s;o long in&s;ulted with impunity.</P>

<P><PB N="95" REF="123">Whatever our &s;ucce&s;&s;es were on the coa&s;t of France, they did not affect us in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e which we had in America. From this part of the world we had long been &s;trangers to any thing, but delays, misfortunes, di&s;ap|pointments, and di&s;graces. But the &s;pirit which had been rou&s;ed at home, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf into all parts of the world where we had any concern, and invigorated all our opera|tions.</P>
<P>Admiral Bo&s;cawen with a powerful fleet of men of war and &s;everal tran&s;ports &s;ailed for Halifax from England. Feb. the 19th. He had the chief command in the expedition again&s;t Loui&s;bourg, and in particular the direction of the naval operations. General Amher&s;t, from who&s;e character great things were expected, and who ju&s;tified the&s;e expec|tations, was to command the land forces. The&s;e amounted to about 14000 men, including &s;ome light troops, fitted for the peculiar &s;ervice of the country. The whole fleet con|&s;i&s;ting of 151 &s;hips, &s;et &s;ail from the harbour of Halifax. On the &s;econd of June they appeared before Loui&s;bourg. They were &s;ix days on the coa&s;t before a landing was found practicable; &s;uch a prodigious &s;urf &s;welled all along the &s;hore, that no boat could po&s;&s;ibly live near it. The French not tru&s;ting to this ob&s;tacle, had drawn intrenchments in every part where it might be po&s;&s;ible to land, &s;upported them with batteries in convenient places, and lined them with numerous infantry. At length the &s;urf though violent at be&s;t,

 <MILESTONE N="June 8."> 

 was ob&s;erved to be &s;ome|what abated, and the Admiral and General did not lo&s;e a moment to avail them&s;elves of this opportunity of landing; they made all their di&s;po&s;itions for it with the highe&s;t judgment. They ordered the frigates towards the enemies right and left, to rake them on their flanks. Then the troops were di&s;po&s;ed for landing in three divi&s;ions. That on the left was commanded by General Wolfe, and was de&s;tined to the real attack. The divi&s;ions in the cen|tre to the right, were only de&s;igned for feigned attacks, to draw the enemies attention to all parts, and to di&s;tract their defence.</P>
<P>When the fire of the frigates continued about a quarter of an hour, General Wolfe's divi&s;ion moved towards the land; the enemy re&s;erved their &s;hot until the boats were near in &s;hore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and mu&s;quetry upon them. The &s;urf aided their

fire. Many of the boats over&s;et, many were broken to pieces, the men jumped into the water, &s;ome were killed, &s;ome drowned; the re&s;t &s;upported and encouraged in all difficulties, by the example, &s;pirit, and conduct of their truly gallant commander, gained the &s;hore, took po&s;t, fell upon the enemy with &s;uch order and re&s;olution, that they &s;oon obliged them to fly in confu&s;ion. As &s;oon as this po&s;t was made good, and centre moved towards the left, and the right followed the centre, &s;o that the landing was com|pleated, though not without much time and trouble, in an excellent order, and with little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The operations of a &s;iege are too minute and intere&s;ting to make a detail of them agreeable to readers, who are not conver&s;ant in the art military. The operations again&s;t Loui&s;bourg for &s;everal days went on very &s;lowly, owing en|tirely to the prodigious &s;urf and the rough weather, which made it extremely difficult to land the artillery, &s;tores, and in&s;truments to be employed in the &s;iege; however, the ex|cellent conduct of the Generals Amher&s;t and Wolfe, by degrees overcame all the difficulties of the weather, which was extremely unfavourable, the ground which was rugged in &s;ome places and boggy in others, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the garri&s;on which was con&s;iderable. The French had five men of war of the line in the harbour, who could bring all their guns to bear upon the approaches of the Engli&s;h troops. The fir&s;t thing done was to &s;ecure a point called the light|hou&s;e battery, from whence they might play upon the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and on the batteries on the other &s;ide of the harbour. General Wolfe performed this &s;ervice with his u&s;ual vigour and celerity, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and all the other po&s;ts in that quarter.

 <MILESTONE N="June 12."> 

 His fire from this po&s;t on the 25th &s;ilenced the i&s;land battery, which was that mo&s;t immediately oppo&s;ed to his; but the &s;hips &s;till continued to bear upon him until the 21&s;t of the follow|ing month, when one of them blew up, and communicating the fire to two others, they al&s;o were in a &s;hort time con|&s;umed to the water edge. This was a lo&s;s not to be repair|ed; the approaches drew near the covered way, and things were in a good condition for making a lodgment in it; the enemies fire was con&s;iderably &s;lackened; the town was con&s;umed to the ground in many places, and the works had &s;uffered much in all. Yet the enemy &s;till delaying to &s;ur|render, gave occa&s;ion to add one brave action to the others,
<PB N="97" REF="127">
which had been di&s;played during the cour&s;e of this &s;iege. The Admiral who had all along done every thing po&s;&s;ible to &s;econd the efforts of the land forces, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, re&s;olved on a &s;troke, which by be|ing deci&s;ive of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the harbour, might make the reduction of the town a matter of little difficulty. He re&s;olved to &s;end in a detachment of 600 &s;eamen in boats, to take or burn the two &s;hips of the line which remained, and if he &s;hould &s;ucceed in this, he propo&s;ed the next day to &s;end in &s;ome of his own great &s;hips, who might batter the town on the &s;ide of the harbour. This was not more wi&s;ely planned by the Admiral, than gallantly and &s;ucce&s;sfully ex|ecuted by Captain L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">forey. In &s;pite of the fire from the &s;hips and the batteries,

 he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of both the&s;e &s;hips; one he towed off, the other, as &s;he ran aground, was &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>This &s;troke, in &s;upport of the &s;pirited advances of the land forces, was conclu&s;ive. The town &s;urren|dered the next day.

    <P>On the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> I had the good fortune to meet Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> with the fleet and the troops coming out of the har|bour of <HI>Halifax.</HI> Lieut. Gen. <HI>Bragg</HI>'s regiment, from the bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> joined the fleet this day.</P>
    <P>The 29th we had fine weather; the &s;hips kept well together; the whole con&s;i&s;ted of 157 &s;ail. The <HI>Dublin</HI> went very &s;ickly into <HI>Halifax.</HI></P>
    <P>The 30th the wind blew hard in the afternoon; the &s;hips were greatly di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
    <P>The 31&s;t the wind &s;ometimes contrary, obliged us to tack, and it blew fre&s;h.</P>
    <P>The 1&s;t of <HI>June</HI> Capt. <HI>Rous</HI> in the <HI>Sutherland</HI> came from off the harbour of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> &s;aid, two &s;hips had got in the 30th; that there were 13 &s;ail in the harbour. We &s;aw the entrance of <HI>Gabarus</HI> at night.</P>
    <P>The 2d it was foggy in the morning; about twelve &s;aw <HI>Loui&s;|bourg</HI> and the &s;hips in the harbour. The fleet, with about a third 
    <PB REF="128" N="98">
    of the troops, anchored in <HI>Gabarus</HI> bay; and this evening, with Brigadiers Generals <HI>Lawrence</HI> and <HI>Wolfe,</HI> I reconnoitred the &s;hore as near as we could, and made a di&s;po&s;ition for landing in three places the next morning, in ca&s;e the troops arrived.</P>
    <P>The enemy had a chain of po&s;ts from Cape <HI>Noir</HI> to the flat <HI>Point,</HI> and irregulars from thence to the bottom of the Bay; &s;ome works thrown up at the places which appeared practicable to land at, and &s;ome batteries.</P>
    <P>On the 3d mo&s;t of the tran&s;ports came in this morning, all well prepared for landing; but the &s;urf on &s;hore was &s;o great, it was impo&s;&s;ible to land. This day Brigadier General <HI>Whitmore</HI> arrived from <HI>Halifax,</HI> at which place I have left Col. <HI>Monckton</HI> to com|mand. As one Bay was found to have le&s;s &s;urf than the others, a di&s;po&s;ition was made to land the next morning in one place in|&s;tead of three.</P>
    <P>The 4th the wind and &s;urf were &s;o very high, Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> told me it was impracticable to land.</P>
    <P>The 5th a great &s;well and fog in the morning, and the Admi|ral declared it &s;till impracticable to land.</P>
    <P>The 6th an appearance of change of weather, in the morning early: I was re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity; the &s;ignal was made to prepare to land between five and &s;ix o'clock, and at eight all the men were in the boats: The fog came on again, and the &s;well encrea&s;ed during the time the men were getting into the boats, and the Admiral again declared it impracticable to land. I ordered the troops on board their re&s;pective &s;hips, fir&s;t acquaint|ing them with the rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>
    <P>The 7th the weather bad in the morning, in the afternoon the &s;well rather decrea&s;ed, and gave us great hopes of landing at day|break the next morning, for which orders were given: and <HI>Bragg</HI>'s regiment, who were in a number of &s;loops, to &s;ail under convoy, by the mouth of the harbour to <HI>Lorembec;</HI> &s;ending at the &s;ame time a proportion of artillery de&s;tined for the light hou&s;e <HI>Point,</HI> with orders to make all the &s;how they could of land|ing, but not to land till further orders, intending to draw the enemy's attention on that &s;ide.</P>
    <P>From the 2d to this time, the enemy have been reinforcing their po&s;ts, adding to their works, cannonading and throwing &s;hells at the &s;hips, and making all the preparations they can to oppo&s;e our landing. Seven tran&s;ports were now mi&s;&s;ing with
    
    <PB REF="129" N="99">
    
    troops on board, three of which came in at night. The Admiral gave all nece&s;&s;ary orders for the frigates to cover our landing.</P>
    <P>On the 8th the troops were a&s;&s;embled in the boats before break of day, in three divi&s;ions; and Commodore <HI>Durell</HI> having viewed the coa&s;t by order of the Admiral, and given me his opinion the troops might land, without danger from the &s;urf, in the bay on our left, the <HI>Kennington</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;now began the fire on the left, followed by the <HI>Grammont, Diana</HI> and <HI>Shannon</HI> frigates in the centre, and the <HI>Sutherland</HI> and <HI>Squirrel</HI> upon the right. When the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour, the boats upon the left rowed into the &s;hore, under the command of Brigadier General <HI>Wolfe,</HI> who&s;e detachment was compo&s;ed of the four elde&s;t companies of grenadiers, followed by the light infantry, (a corps of 540 men, cho&s;en as mark&s;men from the different regiments, &s;erve as irregulars, and are commanded by Major <HI>Scott,</HI> who was Major of the Brigade) and the companies of rangers, &s;upported by the <HI>Highland</HI> regiment, and tho&s;e by the eight remaining compa|nies of grenadiers.</P>
    <P>The divi&s;ion on the right, under the command of Brigadier Gen. <HI>Whitmore,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of the <HI>Royal, La&s;celles, Monckton, Forbes, An&s;truther</HI> and <HI>Webb,</HI> and rowed to our right by the white <HI>Point,</HI> as if intending to force a landing there.</P>
    <P>The centre divi&s;ion, under the command of Brigadier General <HI>Lawrence,</HI> was formed of <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s, <HI>Hop&s;on</HI>'s, <HI>Otway</HI>'s, <HI>Whitmore</HI>'s, <HI>Lawrence</HI>'s, and <HI>Wharburton</HI>'s, and made, at the &s;ame time, a &s;how of landing at the fre&s;h water <HI>Cove.</HI> This drew the enemy's attention to every part, and prevented their troops, po&s;ted along the coa&s;t, from joining tho&s;e on their right.</P>
    <P>The enemy acted very wi&s;ely, did not throw away a &s;hot, till the boats were near in &s;hore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and mu&s;ketry upon them. The &s;urf was &s;o great, that a place could hardly be found to get a boat on &s;hore. Not|with&s;tanding the fire of the enemy, and the violence of the &s;urf, Brigadier <HI>Wolfe</HI> pur&s;ued his point, and landed ju&s;t at their left of the <HI>Cove,</HI> took po&s;t, attacked the enemy, and forced them to retreat. Many boats over&s;et, &s;everal broke to pieces, and all the men jumped into the water to get on &s;hore.</P>
    <P>So &s;oon as the left divi&s;ion was landed, the fir&s;t detachment of the centre rowed at a proper time to the left, and followed; then the remainder of the centre divi&s;ion, as fa&s;t as the boats could

    fetch them from the &s;hips; and the right divi&s;ion followed the centre in like manner.</P>
    <P>It took up a great deal of time to land the troops; the enemy's retreat, or rather flight, was through the roughe&s;t and wor&s;t ground I ever &s;aw; and the pur&s;uit ended with a cannonading from the town, which was &s;o far of u&s;e, that it pointed out how near I could encamp to inve&s;t it: On which the regiments marched to their ground, and lay on their arms. The wind en|crea&s;ed, and we could not get any thing on &s;hore.</P>
    <P>The lo&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's troops at landing is, Capt. <HI>Baillie</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> of the <HI>Highland</HI> regiment; Lieut. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> of mine, 4 &s;erjeants, 1 corporal, and 38 men killed, 21 were of my regiment, (the grenadiers) of which 8 were &s;hot, and the re&s;t drowned in trying to get on &s;hore.</P>
    <P>Five lieutenants, 2 &s;erjeants, 1 corporal, and 51 men wounded; and of the five companies of rangers, 1 en&s;ign and 3 private killed, 1 wounded, and 1 mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
    <P>On the enemy's &s;ide, 2 captains of grenadiers, and 2 lieutenants, are pri&s;oners; 1 officer killed, and an <HI>Indian</HI> chief: Several men likewi&s;e killed; and, I imagine, about 70 men taken pri&s;oners: They were &s;ent on board as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. By &s;ome of the pri|&s;oners I had intelligence, that M. St. <HI>Julien,</HI> Colonel, command|ed in the <HI>Cove:</HI> That there were 5 battalions in the town, name|ly, <HI>Bourgogne, Artois, Royal Marine, Cambi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Volontaires Etrangers,</HI> with about 700 <HI>Canadians.</HI> The three fir&s;t regiments wintered in <HI>Loui&s;bourg; Volontaires Etrangers</HI> came there not long &s;ince with part of the fleet, and <HI>Cambi&s;e</HI> the night before we landed.</P>
    <P>We took from the enemy three 24 pounders, &s;even 9 pounders, and &s;even 6 pounders, two mortars and fourteen &s;wivels; all which were placed along the &s;hore, to prevent our landing; with ammunition tools, and &s;tores of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The 9th. Lieut. Gen. <HI>Bragg</HI>'s regiment returned in their &s;loops from <HI>Lorembec.</HI> The weather continued extremely bad; the &s;urf &s;o great, that we could get only &s;ome of our tents on &s;hore in the afternoon.</P>
    <P>The 10th the furf &s;till continued, and it was with great diffi|culty that we got any thing on &s;hore.</P>
    <P>The 11th the weather grew clear and better, and the light 6 pounders, which I had ordered on &s;hore immediately after the
    <PB REF="133" N="101">
    troops were now only landed, and &s;ome artillery &s;tores with them.</P>
    <P>On the 12th, from intelligence I had received, that the enemy had de&s;troyed the grand battery, and called in their out-po&s;ts, I detached Brigadier <HI>Wolfe</HI> with 1200 men, 4 companies of grena|diers, 3 companies of rangers, and &s;ome light infantry round the N. E. harbour to the <HI>Light Hou&s;e Point,</HI> with an intention to &s;ilence the <HI>I&s;land</HI> battery, and, at the &s;ame time, to attempt to de&s;troy the &s;hips in the Harbour; &s;ending, at the &s;ame time by &s;ea, the proportion of artillery, tools, &amp;c. that had been ordered for this &s;ervice.</P>
    <P>I received, this day, a report from Brigadier <HI>Wolfe,</HI> that he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Light Hou&s;e Point,</HI> and all the po&s;ts on that &s;ide the harbour, which the enemy had abandoned, leaving &s;e|veral cannon, which were rendered u&s;ele&s;s, tools, &amp;c. and a great quantity of fi&s;h at <HI>Lorembec.</HI> The weather continued extremely bad; but we got &s;ome tools on &s;hore this night, &s;o that, on the 13th. we began to make a communication from the right to the left in front of the camp; and I ordered three redoubts on the mo&s;t advantageous ground in the front. A party of the enemy came out this day towards our camp, but were &s;oon beat back by the light Infantry, before two picquets could well get up to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We worked at three redoubts in front all night.</P>
    <P>The 14th the enemy cannonaded us a great part of the day. The &s;urf &s;till continued &s;o great, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty we could land any thing. The fleet, under the com|mand of Sir <HI>Charles Hardy,</HI> which appeared ye&s;terday for the fir&s;t time, was in the night blown off to &s;ea.</P>
    <P>The 15th I &s;ent four more mortars in a &s;loop to the <HI>Light Hou&s;e,</HI> but we could not get any artillery landed on this &s;hore. At night two de&s;erters from the <HI>Volontares Etrangers</HI> came in; &s;aid they had 5 killed and 40 wounded in the &s;kirmi&s;h on the 13th.</P>
    <P>The 16th, the fir&s;t fine weather, we landed 12 days provi&s;ion, and got many things on &s;hore, but could not land any artillery.</P>
    <P>The 17th I got Colonel <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> on hor&s;eback, and, with Col. <HI>William&s;on</HI> and Major <HI>M' Kellar,</HI> we reconnoitred the whole ground as far as we could; and Colonel <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> was determined in his opinion of making approaches by the <HI>Green Hill,</HI> and con|fining the de&s;truction of the &s;hips in the harbour, to the <HI>Light
    <PB REF="134" N="102">
    Hou&s;e Point,</HI> and the batteries on that &s;ide. I added two 8 inch mortars and three royals to the <HI>Light Hou&s;e</HI> batteries.</P>
    <P>The 18th we had fine weather. Some <HI>Indians</HI> took three of the tran&s;ports men at the bottom of <HI>Gabarus</HI> bay who landed there contrary to orders. The road for the artillery was pu&s;hed on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. We got three 23 pounders on &s;hore, though the &s;urf was great the beginning of the day.</P>
    <P>The 19th the batteries on the <HI>Light Hou&s;e</HI> were intended to have been opened this night, but could not be got ready &s;o &s;oon. <HI>L'Echo,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> frigate of 32 guns, was brought in to-day; had got out of the harbour the 13th at night, and was bound to <HI>Quebec:</HI> By her we have intelligence, that the <HI>Bizane</HI> got out the day we landed, and the <HI>Comette</HI> &s;ince our arrival off the harbour.</P>
    <P>The 20th the <HI>I&s;land Battery</HI> and &s;hips fired at the batteries on the &s;hore, who began their fire this la&s;t night. The enemy burnt an old &s;hip at the bottom of the harbour.</P>
    <P>The 21&s;t very bad weather, and the &s;urf high. The enemy di&s;covered us making the road for the artillery, and cannonaded us; threw &s;ome &s;hot into the left of the camp, but did not oblige me to decamp any part. An advanced redoubt towards <HI>Green Hill</HI> was thrown up this night.</P>
    <P>The 22d the bad weather continued; we were employed on the road, and getting up a <HI>Block Hou&s;e</HI> on the left by the <HI>Miray</HI> road, to &s;ecure the communication to the N. E. harbour and <HI>Light Hou&s;e,</HI> and to hinder any parties from going into the town.</P>
    <P>The 23d the Admiral a&s;&s;ured me there were above a hundred boats lo&s;t in landing the troops and provi&s;ions. This day fine weather; and we now have on &s;hore twelve 24 pounders, and &s;ix 12 pounders. The enemy fired a great deal from their &s;hipping and <HI>I&s;land Battery,</HI> and threw &s;ome &s;hot into the left of the camp. Colonel <HI>Me&s;&s;ervey,</HI> and mo&s;t of his carpenters, taken ill of the &s;mall-pox, which is a very great lo&s;s to the army. Gabions and fa&s;cines are landed, and carried forward as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, to make an epaulement to <HI>Green Hill.</HI> The batteries at the <HI>Light Hou&s;e</HI> fire with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the <HI>I&s;land Battery,</HI> and I hope will &s;oon &s;ilence it.</P>
    <P>On the 24th the enemy fired on the <HI>Light Hou&s;e Batteries</HI> from the town and &s;hipping, and on our advanced redoubt, which was fini&s;hed, they fired from the town. Colonel <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> remained fixed in his opinion of advancing by <HI>Green Hill.</HI> We had this
    <PB REF="135" N="103">
    day in the park of artillery thirteen 24 pounders, and &s;even 12 pounders.</P>
    <P>The 25th the cannonading continued night and day: In the evening the <HI>I&s;land Battery</HI> was &s;ilenced; their own fire had helped to break down part of their works: Fa&s;cines and gabions were forwarded to <HI>Green Hill</HI> as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. All the men employed at work, and making the nece&s;&s;ary communications. The enemy fired a good deal at our advanced redoubt.</P>
    <P>The 26th a &s;mall alarm on the left of a party that had advanc|ed from the town; had got up to the <HI>Block Hou&s;e,</HI> which was not quite fini&s;hed. They had with them a barrel of pitch to &s;et it on fire: The guard on it was not &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e a large party; but a detachment was &s;ent out &s;o quick, that they were forced to retreat without effecting their de&s;ign, though two of the men had been in the <HI>Block Hou&s;e,</HI> and they were drove back into the town very fa&s;t. Three hundred pioneers ordered to <HI>Green Hill.</HI> Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> landed 200 marines, and took the po&s;t at <HI>Kennington Cove,</HI> which is a great ea&s;e to the army. I de&s;ired of the Admiral four 32 pounders and two 24 pounders to leave at the <HI>Light Hou&s;e,</HI> to keep the <HI>I&s;land Battery</HI> in ruin, that with a proper number of men intrenched there, Brigadier <HI>Wolfe,</HI> with his detachment, might be able to come round the harbour, bringing his artillery with him; and to try to de&s;troy the &s;hipping, and to advance towards the <HI>We&s;t Gate.</HI></P>
    <P>The 27th one bra&s;s 24 pounder was lo&s;t in 12 fathom water, by &s;lipping off the <HI>catamaran</HI>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of raft much u&s;ed at &s;ea.</NOTE>

, as they were coming from the &s;hip to land it. The cannon I a&s;ked of the Admiral were landed this night at the <HI>Light Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
    <P>The 28th a great many popping &s;hots and cannonading. As the po&s;t at <HI>Green Hill</HI> was covered, we began the road over the bog, and throwing up an epaulement. Colonel <HI>Me&s;&s;ervey</HI> and his &s;on both died this day; and of his company of carpenters of 108 men, all but 16 in the &s;mall-pox, who are nur&s;es to the &s;ick. This is particularly unlucky at this time.</P>
    <P>The 29th cannonading continued; the frigate fired con&s;tantly at the epaulement; we pur&s;ued working at the road which co&s;t a great deal of labour: At night the enemy &s;unk 4 &s;hips in the harbour's mouth; <HI>Apollo,</HI> a two deck'd one, <HI>la Fidelle</HI> of 36 guns, <HI>la Chevre,</HI> and <HI>la Biche,</HI> of 16 guns each, and they cut

    off mo&s;t of their ma&s;ts. Remain in the harbour five of the line of battle, and a frigate of 36 guns.</P>
    <P>The 30th, at night, &s;ome firing at <HI>Kennington Cove:</HI> The ma|rines thought they &s;aw <HI>Indians:</HI> The frigate fired all night at the epaulement, as the men worked in the night time.</P>
    <P>The 1&s;t of July, the enemy creeped out in the morning to get &s;ome old pali&s;ades and wood. Brig. <HI>Wolfe</HI> and Major <HI>Scott</HI>'s light infantry pu&s;hed them in with a very bri&s;k fire; and the Brigadier took po&s;t on the hills, from whence it was intended to try to demoli&s;h the &s;hipping; we marched forward on the right; forced the enemy back to <HI>Cape Noir</HI> with a &s;mart fire.</P>
    <P>The 2d. the epaulement and road went on heavily, from the extreme badne&s;s of the ground: The enemy continued their cannonading, and threw &s;ome &s;hells: We &s;kirmi&s;hed all day with parties out of the town.</P>
    <P>The 3d, a great cannonading from the town and &s;hipping on the batteries. Brig. <HI>Wolfe</HI> was making an advanced work on the right, thrown up at 650 yards from the covered way, with an in|tention of erecting a battery to de&s;troy the defences of the place, it being pretty well on the capital of the <HI>Citadel Ba&s;tion;</HI> and the falling of the ground from this place, towards the works, would hinder di&s;covering as much of the works, as would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to do them any con&s;iderable damage. In the evening the &s;ea officers thought &s;ome of the &s;hips would try to get out of the harbour. The batteries on the left immediately played on them, but it grew &s;o dark they could not continue.</P>
    <P>The 4th a great fog; when there were glares of light, the cannonading began; 500 men kept continually making fa&s;cines.</P>
    <P>The 5th very bad weather; the epaulement was ha&s;tened on as much as po&s;&s;ible, it &s;wallowed up an immen&s;e number of fa&s;|cines, co&s;t &s;ome men, as the frigate cannonaded on it without cea&s;ing.</P>
    <P>The 6th a &s;loop &s;ailed out of the harbour with a flag of truce to Sir <HI>Charles Hardy,</HI> to carry &s;ome things to their wounded of|ficers and pri&s;oners.</P>
    <P>The many difficulties of landing every thing in almo&s;t a conti|nual &s;urf, the making of roads, draining and pa&s;&s;ing of bogs, and putting our&s;elves under cover, render our approach to the place much longer than I could wi&s;h.</P>
    <P>On the 7th we had very foggy weather; cannonading
    <PB REF="139" N="105">
    conti|nued all day, and a good deal of popping &s;hots from the advanced po&s;ts.</P>
    <P>The 8th I intended an attack on &s;ome advanced po&s;ts at <HI>Cape Noir,</HI> but it did not take place. Col <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> got a contu&s;ion by a musket ball on his boot, which laid him up in the gout.</P>
    <P>The 9th, in the night, the enemy made a Sortie where Briga|dier <HI>Lawrence</HI> commanded: they came from <HI>Cape Noir,</HI> and though drunk, I am afraid rather &s;urpri&s;ed a company of grena|diers of <HI>Forbs</HI>'s, commanded by Lord <HI>Dundonald,</HI> who were po&s;ted in a <HI>Fleecke</HI> on the right. Major <HI>Murray,</HI> who cammand|ed three companies of grenadiers immediately detached one, and drove the enemy back very ea&s;ily. <HI>Whitmore</HI>'s and <HI>Bragg</HI>'s gre|nadiers behaved very well on this occa&s;ion. Lord <HI>Dundonald</HI> was killed, Lieut. <HI>Tew</HI> wounded and taken pri&s;oner, Capt. <HI>Bontein</HI> of the engineers taken pri&s;oner: 1 corporal, 3 men killed; 1 &s;erjeant, 11 men mi&s;&s;ing; 17 men wounded: The Sortie was of five picquets, &s;upported by 600 men; a Captain, <HI>Chevalier de Chauvelin</HI> was killed, a Lieutenant wounded and taken pri|&s;oner: 17 men killed, 4 wounded and brought off pri&s;oners, be&s;ides what wounded they carried into the town, one of which, a Captain, died immediately. The enemy &s;ent out a flag of truce to bury their dead, which when over, the cannonading began again. The frigate was &s;o hurt, &s;he hauled clo&s;e to the town; the &s;hips fired very much again&s;t Brig. <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s batteries.</P>
    <P>The 10th, the road at the epaulement went on a little better; the enemy fired a great deal, and threw many &s;hells.</P>
    <P>The 11th, a waggoner was taken off by &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> between the block-hou&s;e and the left of the N. E. harbour.</P>
    <P>The 12th it rained very hard all night; not a man in the de|tachment could have a dry thread on; we made an advanced work to <HI>Green Hill;</HI> at night the waggoner who had been taken, luckily made his e&s;cape, &s;aid, they were 250 <HI>Canadians.</HI> The <HI>Citadel Ba&s;tion</HI> fired very &s;martly.</P>
    <P>The 13th, the enemy threw a great many &s;hells; we perfect|ed our works as fa&s;t as we could; bad rainy weather; the ene|my was at work at <HI>Cape Noir</HI> to hinder us taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion near that point, which is of no con&s;equence; &s;ome de&s;erters came in, &s;aid a &s;loop of <HI>Miray</HI> got in three days ago.</P>

    <P>The 15th, the cannonading and firing continued; the enemy tried to throw &s;ome &s;hells into camp, &s;uppo&s;ed to be intended again&s;t our powder magazine: At ten at night the <HI>Light Hou&s;e</HI> battery fired &s;ome rockets as a &s;ignal of &s;hips &s;ailing out of the harbour

; Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI> an&s;wered it; the frigate got out, and Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI>'s fleet got under &s;ail and went to &s;ea. Be|fore day break, Capt. <HI>Sutherland,</HI> po&s;ted at the end of the N.E. harbour, was attacked, and there was a great deal of firing; the grenadiers of Brig. <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s corps marched to &s;u&s;tain him, and all the light infantry; it was over before they could get up, and by a de&s;erter from the enemy, they were only 100 men come from <HI>Miray,</HI> where they left Mon&s;. <HI>de Bo&s;biere,</HI> who had, on the other &s;ide the water, 300 men with boats to pa&s;s. Major <HI>Scott,</HI> with the light infantry, pur&s;ued, but could not get up with them. I encamped a corps forward.</P>
    <P>The 16th, towards night, Brig. <HI>Wolfe</HI> pu&s;hed on a corps and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hills in the front of the <HI>Bara&s;oy,</HI> where we made a lodgment; the enemy fired very bri&s;kly from the town and &s;hipping.</P>
    <P>The 17th, a great fire continued from the town and &s;hipping; we re&s;olved to extend the parallel from the right to the left. The fleet returned.</P>
    <P>The 18th, all la&s;t night the enemy fired musketry from the covert way, and tried to throw &s;hells into the camp.</P>
    <P>The 19th, I relieved the trenches by battalions, the 14 batta|lions forming 3 brigades; a &s;mart fire from the covert way, the batteries on the left fired again&s;t the ba&s;tion <HI>Dauphine</HI> with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
    <P>The 21&s;t, one of the &s;hips in the harbour, that had &s;ome pow|der blown up in her, made a great explo&s;ion, and &s;et the &s;hip on fire, which &s;oon caught the &s;ails of two more; they burned very fa&s;t, and we kept firing on them the whole time, to try to hinder the boats and people from the town to get to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the

    <P>The 22d, two batteries on the right opened with thirteen 24 pounders, and another of 7 mortars, and fired with great &s;ucce&s;s; the enemy fired very well from the town for &s;ome time, and threw their &s;hells into our works. Our &s;hells put the citadel in flames. I ordered Col. <HI>William&s;on</HI> to confine his fire as much as he could to the defences of the place, that we might not de&s;troy the hou|&s;es. A Lt. of the <HI>Royal Americans,</HI> going his rounds on an an|vanced po&s;t, lo&s;t his way, and was taken pri&s;oner near <HI>Cape Noir.</HI> A battery was begun on the left for four 24 pounders.</P>
    <P N="23">23d, the cohorns were u&s;ed at night, and the <HI>French</HI> mortars &s;ent to throw &s;tones from the trenches. The enemy fired all &s;orts of old iron, and any &s;tuff they could pick up. Col. <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> was out to-day for the fir&s;t time &s;ince he received the contu&s;ion. Our batteries fired with great &s;ucce&s;s. This night the &s;hells &s;et fire to the barracks, and they burnt with great violence.</P>
    <P>On the 24th, the fire was very brisk on our &s;ide, and the ene|my's decrea&s;ed. The Admiral gave me 400 &s;eamen to help to work at the batteries, &amp;c. and 200 miners added to a corps of 100 already e&s;tabli&s;hed, that we might make quick work of it, and they were immediately employed. The 4 gun battery opened, and another of 5 erecting. One of the men of war in the harbour, the <HI>Bienfai&s;ant,</HI> fired at our trenches at high-water, and the <HI>Citadel</HI> and <HI>Bafiion Dauphine</HI> fired again&s;t the 4 gun bat|tery; but our men firing &s;mall arms into the embrazures, beat the enemy off their guns.</P>
    <P>The 25th, the batteries fired with great &s;ucce&s;s. The Admiral &s;ent me word, he intended to &s;end in boats with 600 men, to take or de&s;troy the <HI>Prudent</HI> and the <HI>Bienfai&s;ant</HI> in the harbour. I or|dered all the batteries at night to fire into the works as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep the enemy's attention to the land. The miners and workmen went on very well with their approaches to the co|vered way, though they had a continued and very &s;mart fire from it, and grape &s;hot, and all &s;orts of old iron from the guns of the ramparts. We continued our fire without cea&s;ing, and a <HI>Ricochet:</HI> The boats got to the &s;hips at one in the morning, and took them both: they were obliged to burn the <HI>Prudent</HI> as &s;he was aground, and they towed off the <HI>Bienfai&s;ant</HI> to the N.

<P><PB N="112" REF="150">Excepting this lo&s;s, the army had hitherto proceeded &s;ucce&s;sfully. In a little time they appeared before Ticon|deroga. This is a very important po&s;t, and as &s;trongly &s;ecured.

 <MILESTONE N="July 8."> 

 The fort is &s;ituated on a tongue of land between Lake George and a narrow gut, which communicates with the Lake Champlain. On three &s;ides it is &s;urrounded with water; and for a good part of the fourth it has a dangerous mora&s;s in front; where that failed, the French had made a very &s;trong line upwards of eight feet high, defended by cannon, and &s;ecured by 4 or 5000 men. A great fall of trees with their branches out|ward, was &s;pread before the entrenchment for about an hundred yards.</P>
<P>The General cau&s;ed the ground to be reconnoitred; and the engineer made &s;o favourable a report of the weakne&s;s of the entrenchment, that it appeared practicable to force it by mu&s;quetry alone. A fatal re&s;olution was taken, in con|&s;equence of this report, not to wait the arrival of the artil|lery, which on account of the badne&s;s of the ground, could not be ea&s;ily brought up, but to attack the enemy without lo&s;s of time. They were confirmed in this precipitate re|&s;olution, by a rumour that a body of 3000 men were on their march to join the French at Ticonderoga, and very &s;hortly expected to arrive.</P>
<P>When the attack began, the difficulty of the ground, and

the &s;trength of the enemies lines which had been &s;o little fore&s;een, was but too &s;everely felt. Although the troops behaved with the utmo&s;t &s;pirit and gallantry, they &s;uffered &s;o terribly in their approaches, and made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion on the entrenchment, that the General &s;eeing their reitera|ted and ob&s;tinate efforts fail of &s;ucce&s;s, being upwards of four hours expo&s;ed to a mo&s;t terrible fire, thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to order a retreat, to &s;ave the remains of the army. Near 2000 of our men were killed, wounded and taken pri|&s;oners; the number of the taken being very incon&s;iderable. This precipitate attack, was followed by a retreat as preci|pitate; in&s;omuch that our army gained their for|mer camp to the &s;outhward of Lake George,

<P>THE embarkation of the artillery, &s;tores and provi&s;ions being compleated on the evening of the 4th in&s;tant; next morn|ing at break of day the tents were &s;truck, and all the troops, amounting to 6367 regulars, officers, light infantry, and rangers included, and 9024 provincials, including officers and batteau men, embarked in about 900 ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eaux, and 135 whale boats, the artillery to cover our landing, being mounted on rafts.</P>
<P>At five in the evening, reached <HI>Sabbath Day Points</HI> (25 miles down the Lake) where we halted till ten, then got under way again, and proceeded to the landing place (a cove leading to the <HI>French</HI> advanced guard) which we reached early next morning the 6th.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival, &s;ent out a reconnoitring party; and having met with no oppo&s;ition, landed the troops, formed them in four columns, regulars in the centre, and provincials on the flanks, and marched toward the enemy's advanced guard, compo&s;ed of one battalion, po&s;ted on a logged camp, which, upon our ap|proach they de&s;erted, fir&s;t &s;etting fire to their tents, and de&s;troy|ing every thing they could; but as their retreat was very precipi|tate, they left &s;everal things behind, which they had not time either to burn or carry off. In this camp we likewi&s;e found one pri&s;oner and a dead man.</P>
<P>The army in the foregoing order continued their march through
<PB N="122" REF="152">
the wood on the we&s;t-&s;ide, with a de&s;ign to inve&s;t <HI>Ticonderoga,</HI> but the wood being very thick, impa&s;&s;able with any regularity to &s;uch a body of men, and the guides un&s;kilful, the troops were be|wildered, and the columns broke, falling in one upon another.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Howe,</HI> at the head of the right centre colum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;upported by the light infantry, being advanced, fell in with a <HI>French</HI> party, &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of about 400 regulars, and a few <HI>Indians,</HI> who had likewi&s;e lo&s;t them&s;elves in the retreat from the advanced guard; of the&s;e our flankers killed a great many, and took 148 pri&s;oners, among whom were five officers and three cadets.</P>
<P>But this &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s co&s;t us very dear, not as to the lo&s;s, of numbers, for we had only two officers killed, but as to con&s;e|quence, his lord&s;hip being the fir&s;t man that fell in this &s;kirmi&s;h; and as he was, very de&s;ervedly, univer&s;ally beloved and re&s;pected throughout the whole army, it is ea&s;y to conceive the grief and con&s;ternation his untimely fall occa&s;ioned; for my part, I cannot help owning that I felt it mo&s;t heavily, and lament him as &s;in|cerely.</P>
<P>The 7th, the troops being greatly fatigued, by having been one whole night on the water, the following day con&s;tantly on foot, and the next day under arms, added to their being in want of provi&s;ion, having dropped what they had brought with them, in order to lighten them&s;elves, it was thought advi&s;eable to return to the landing place, which we accordingly did about eight that morning.</P>

there, after de&s;troying the mill and breaking down their bridge, had retired &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. <HI>Brad&s;treet</HI> having laid another bridge a cro&s;s, and having &s;ent me notice of his being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that ground, I accordingly marched thither with the troops, and we took up our quarters there that night.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners we had taken being unanimous in their reports, that the <HI>French</HI> had eight battalions, &s;ome <HI>Canadians</HI> and colony troops, in all about 6000, encamped before their fort, who were intrenching them&s;elves, and throwing up a brea&s;t-work, and that they expected a reinforcement of 3000 <HI>Canadians,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> who had been detached under the command of Mon&s;. <HI>de Levy,</HI> to make a diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of the <HI>Mohawk</HI> river; but upon intelligence of our preparations and near approach, had been repeatedly recalled, and was hourly expected; it was thought mo&s;t advi&s;eable to lo&s;e no time in making the attack; wherefore early in the morning of the 8th, I &s;ent Mr. <HI>Clerk,</HI> the engineer, acro&s;s the river on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the fort, in order to recon|noitre the enemy's intrenchments.</P>
<P>Upon his return, and favourable report of the practicability of carrying tho&s;e works, if attacked before they were fini&s;hed, it was agreed to &s;torm them that very day: Accordingly the rangers, light infantry, and the right wing of <HI>Provincials,</HI> were ordered immediately to march and po&s;t them&s;elves in a line, out of can|non &s;hot of the intrenchments; the right extending to <HI>Lake George,</HI> and the left to <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> in order that the regular troops, de&s;tined for the attack of the intrenchments, might form on their rear.</P>
<P>The <HI>Piquets</HI> were to begin the attack, &s;u&s;tained by the grena|diers, and by the battalions: the whole were ordered to march up bri&s;kly, ru&s;h upon the enemy's fire, and not give theirs, until they were within the enemy's brea&s;t-work.</P>
<P>After the&s;e orders i&s;&s;ued, the whole army, except what had been left at the landing-place to cover and guard the batteaux and whale boats, and a <HI>Provincial</HI> regiment at the <HI>Saw-mill,</HI> were put in motion, and advanced to <HI>Ticonderoga,</HI> where they unfor|tunately found the intrenchments, not only much &s;tronger than had been repre&s;ented, and the brea&s;t-work at lea&s;t eight or nine feet high; but likewi&s;e the ground before it covered with felled trees, the branches pointed outwards, which &s;o fatigued and re|tarded

<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ucce&s;s of Col. Brad&s;treet greatly facilitated that of the expedition under Gen. Forbes. The General had had a very tedious and trouble&s;ome march, through a country almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, very little known, and continually hara&s;&s;ed on his route by the enemies Indi|ans. An advanced guard of this army, con&s;i&s;ting of about 800 men under Major Grant, had mo&s;t unaccountably ad|vanced to Fort du Que&s;ne, with a de&s;ign as it &s;hould &s;eem of reducing the place by a <HI>coup de main;</HI> but the garri&s;on &s;uddenly &s;allying out and attacking them warmly on all &s;ides, killed and made pri&s;oners many of this party, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. This was, however, their la&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; for the body of the army being conducted with greater &s;kill and cir|cum&s;pection, baffled all their attempts; &s;o that the French being convinced by &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes that all their efforts to &s;urprize the troops, or interrupt their communication were to no purpo&s;e, and being con&s;cious that their fort was not tenable again&s;t a regular attack, they wi&s;ely aban|doned the place after de&s;troying their works;

<P>* The river <HI>Senga,</HI> or <HI>Senegal,</HI> is in one of tho&s;e channels of the river <HI>Niger,</HI> by which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;charge its waters into the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean: The river <HI>Niger,</HI> according to the be&s;t maps, ri&s;es in the ea&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI> and after a cour&s;e of 300 miles, nearly due we&s;t, divides into three branches, the mo&s;t northerly of which is the <HI>Senegal,</HI> as above; the middle is the <HI>Gambia,</HI> or <HI>Gambra;</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;outhern, <HI>Rio Grande.

The entrance of it is guarded by &s;everal forts, the principal of which is Fort <HI>Lewis,</HI> built on an i&s;land of the &s;ame name. It is a quadrangular fort, with two ba&s;tions, and of no incon&s;ide|rable &s;trength. At the mouth of the river is a bar; the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for pa&s;&s;ing it, is from <HI>March</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> or rather from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>July,</HI> becau&s;e the tides are then highe&s;t.

The <HI>Dutch</HI> were the fir&s;t who &s;ettled <HI>Senegal,</HI> and built two forts. The <HI>French</HI> made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of them in 1678.

<P>From the Ea&s;t Indies we have this year heard nothing remarkable. It does not &s;eem that the French, notwith&s;tand|ing the great &s;truggle they made to &s;end out a &s;trong arma|ment under Gen. Lally, have been in a condition to enter|pri&s;e any thing. It is &s;aid, and probably with good founda|tion, that the greate&s;t part of that force was dwindled away with &s;ickne&s;s during the voyage. Our naval force was ex|erted with &s;pirit and effect in the Mediterranean. The French found that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Minorca could not drive us from the dominion of the Mediterranean, where Admi|ral O&s;born gave the enemies maritime &s;trength &s;uch blows, as they mu&s;t long feel, and which merited him the greate&s;t of all honours, to be joined with the conquerors of Louis|bourg, in the thanks of the repre&s;entative body of their country.</P>
<P>The coming year &s;eems big with great events. In Ger|many the affairs of the rival powers of Pru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria, appear to be more nearly ballanced than at any time &s;ince the beginning of the war. This force is as great as ever, and their animo&s;ity is no way le&s;&s;ened. Great &s;teps are ta|ken to a&s;&s;emble powerful armies on the Rhine; whil&s;t Great Britain has &s;ent out two con&s;iderable armaments, one to the We&s;t Indies, the other to Africa; the &s;ucce&s;s of which mu&s;t go a great way towards determining the i&s;&s;ue of the war. Other great preparations are al&s;o making on the part of Great Britain. In the mean time, the Dutch enraged at the captures of their &s;hips, make complaints, and threaten armaments. The death of the Prince&s;s of Orange, which happened at a mo&s;t critical juncture, adds more perplexity to affairs in that quarter. If we look to the &s;outhward, the clouds &s;eem gathering there al&s;o. The imminent death of the King of Spain, will be an event fruitful of troubles. In this affair the King of Sardinia, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the hou&s;e of Bourbon, will find them&s;elves concerned; to &s;ay nothing of the maritime powers. In a word, the flame of war threatens to &s;pread in every part of Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The inclinations of the Powers at war at the clo&s;ing the la&s;t campaign. The King of Spain's death apprehended. Con|dition of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, Empre&s;s Queen, Ru&s;&s;ia, Sweden, Holland, France, and England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHOEVER reflects upon the conclu&s;ion of the &s;everal campaigns &s;ince the year 1755, will ea&s;ily perceive that at the end of the la&s;t, the fortune of the &s;everal powers at war &s;eemed more nearly upon a ballance, than it had been at the clo&s;e of any of the former. The campaign was rather le&s;s bloody, than that which immediately preceeded it; and it was not concluded with any action of &s;uch an eclat, as could greatly rai&s;e, or depre&s;s the hopes of any of the contending parties. All parties became more cautious; becau&s;e it be|came every day more evident, that the fortune of war was not to be decided by any &s;ingle &s;troke, however con&s;iderable.
<PB N="133" REF="166">
The prize was re&s;erved for the player of the &s;kilful game; for the mo&s;t attentive patience: for the greate&s;t depth of re&s;ources. An equality of this kind &s;eemed at la&s;t to pro|mi&s;e Europe &s;ome repo&s;e. All &s;ides might now give and receive honourable and equitable terms; and peace might be &s;ettled on that footing, on which it has been u&s;ually made, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in our part of the world. But the great de&s;igns entertained by each power; revenge imbittered by the blows which all had felt in their turns, the con&s;ideration of the va&s;t expences that fell upon all, and which a peace at that time would have made fruitle&s;s; even the hopes ari&s;ing from the equivocal appearances of the la&s;t campaign, e&s;tranged every court from the di&s;po&s;ition to peace. In&s;o|much that there were no terms directly offered by any of the belligerent power; nor did any of the neutral interpo&s;e their mediation. Be&s;ides the&s;e, another cau&s;e operated powerfully; a great event was hourly expected about this time; an event which threatened to involve the Southern parts of Europe in the calamities of that war, that had &s;o long wa&s;ted the Northern; and which, whenever it &s;hould take place, threatened to render the political &s;y&s;tem infi|nitely more intricate, and probably to give the war quite a new turn.</P>
<P>The late King of Spain, by the force of a conjugal affec|tion, rarely &s;een in that dignity, &s;ince the death of his Queen had been given up to a melancholy, which preyed upon his health, and affected his under&s;tanding. His death, or incapacity, appeared inevitable within a &s;hort time. The King of Naples, Don Carlo&s;s, was next in the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. In the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, it had been agreed, that the dutchies of Parma, Placentia and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in ca&s;e Don Carlos &s;hould ever come to the crown of Spain. The&s;e countries were at the end of that war, in the hands of the Empre&s;s Queen, or her allies. Her imperial Maje&s;ty had &s;et up a claim to the rever&s;ion of the&s;e dutchies, on the ex|tinction of i&s;&s;ue male in the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e. But the ambition of the Queen of Spain to make all her children Sovereigns, put powerful bars in her way to it. This am|bition was one of the cau&s;es which made the la&s;t &s;o general a war. The peace of Aix la Chapelle, which put a period to that war, after &s;ettling the&s;e conte&s;ted dutchies as an e&s;tabli&s;hment for Don Philip, &s;econd &s;on to the King of
<PB N="134" REF="167">
Spain, provided, that whenever the event, which we have mentioned above, &s;hould take place, that is to &s;ay, the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Don Carlos to the crown of Spain, then the King|dom of Naples and Sicily &s;hould pa&s;s to the infant Don Philip, and the dutchies which formed his e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould refer to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The King of Naples, not without rea&s;on, looked upon this article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, as injurious to his rights; accordingly he never acceded to it. No method in this ca&s;e could be &s;een, which might prevent matters from coming to extremities, except the &s;ituation of the Em|pre&s;s, engaged as &s;he was with a powerful adver&s;ary, who kept her forces &s;trained to the utmo&s;t pitch. She was in no condition to engage in a new war, however intere&s;ting the object might be. Her ally France, who &s;o ineffectually a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in Germany, could not probably a&s;&s;i&s;t her with more effect in Italy; &s;he therefore &s;eemed to have no other part left, than to acquie&s;ce for the pre&s;ent, and wait in &s;ilence a more favourable opportunity to a&s;&s;ert her claims. The event of the King of Spain's death has &s;ince happened. It has produced none of the&s;e immediate effects which were apprehended; and this probably proceeded from the cau&s;e which we have ju&s;t now hinted. A dead calm at pre&s;ent broods over Italy. But in this tranquility and &s;ilence there are materials gathering, which may in no very di&s;tant period bur&s;t in a terrible tempe&s;t over that delightful country. They are very nearly the &s;ame that produced the la&s;t trou|bles there, and may not only revive them, but &s;pread the horrors of war once more over all Europe.</P>
<P>Such were the inclinations of the powers at war at the opening of this year; their &s;trength &s;eemed al&s;o very entire; in particular, the re&s;ources of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia appeared a&s;toni&s;hing, after the great blows he had &s;uffered; and after the advantages he had gained, but gained at &s;o high a price. He was &s;till able to &s;hew him&s;elf the father and benefactor, as well as the protector of his people. In the mid&s;t of the devouring wa&s;te of &s;uch an expen&s;ive war, from the funds of his oecomony he was enabled to remit the taxes to tho&s;e parts of his dominions, which had &s;uffered from the Ru&s;&s;ian barbarity; he even advanced money to tho&s;e which had &s;uffered the mo&s;t con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>To take a nearer view of his &s;ituation, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the whole kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;till remained in the

hands of the Mu&s;covites. The dutchy of Cleves, together with his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the Rhine, could yield him nothing; they were held by the French; but in the&s;e re&s;|pects, his &s;ituation was not wor&s;e than it had been, almo&s;t from the beginning of the war. He had to ballance the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, the rich country of Saxony, which he had twice in one campaign wre&s;ted from the hands of the Au&s;trians. Add to this, the renewal of the &s;ub&s;idy treaty with Great Britain, on the advantageous terms of the former year. The&s;e were undoubtedly great &s;upports; and the King &s;eemed as entire in power, and more advanced in reputation than ever.</P>
<P>But to a more critical examination, things had an a&s;pect not quite &s;o favourable. This appearance was rather &s;pe|cious than entirely &s;olid; and whil&s;t all without looked full and fair, within there was a decay of &s;ub&s;tance, and an hollowne&s;s that rung at the &s;lighte&s;t touch. That incom|parable body of troops, which at the beginning of the war had given him &s;o great a &s;uperiority, no longer exi&s;ted in the &s;ame per&s;ons. If his troops derived advantages from a long &s;eries of active &s;ervice, the&s;e advantages were equally on the &s;ide of the enemy. His army had known what it is to be beaten; and it is no wonder, if a &s;ort of wearine&s;s and de&s;pair began to creep upon them, after &s;uch an infi|nite train of unrewarded fatigues, when they &s;aw that &s;o many wonderful exploits had not yet ended the war in their favour. Many of his be&s;t generals had been killed in battle, or died, or had retired, or were di&s;graced. The hoards which he had ama&s;&s;ed before the war, by this time mu&s;t have been intirely &s;pent; his dominions mu&s;t have been greatly exhau&s;ted, both of men and money. Saxony could no longer yield &s;uch &s;upplies as formerly. The indigence of the &s;ubdued inhabitants, &s;et bounds to the rapacity of the conqueror. The &s;ub&s;idy of Great Britain did a great deal; but it could not &s;upply the de|ficiencies on this, and on every other &s;ide. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, probably, made the King of Pru&s;&s;ia more cautious and dilatory than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna had as great burthens to &s;u&s;tain as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;he had &s;uffered much greater blows. That power has a &s;trength, &s;omewhat unaccount|able and peculiar to her&s;elf. More deficient in pecuniary funds, than any other great power in Europe, &s;he is better able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and to do con&s;iderable things without them.
<PB N="136" REF="169">
For by a long habit, the whole &s;tate is formed to its nece&s;|&s;ities; and the &s;ubject is more ready to &s;upply free quarter, and to indure military licence than any other. The coun|try is abundantly fruitful in all its parts. And whil&s;t the war is carried on near home, an arbitrary government, operating on &s;o exten&s;ive an object, can hardly fail of &s;uch re&s;ources, as mu&s;t &s;erve an Au&s;trian army; which is &s;till paid in a great mea&s;ure, as Tacitus de&s;cribes the troops of the antient Germans to have been; <HI>they have a plentiful table in lieu of pay.</HI>

<P>And indeed it mu&s;t be owned, that there is no Sovereign, who is more highly honoured in his dominions, or obeyed with a greater mixture of love and reverence, by all his &s;ubjects, than her Imperial Maje&s;ty. So that having a very ample power, very willing obedience, a large territory and many men, not &s;ufficiently employed in the arts of peace, it perhaps may be gue&s;&s;ed, in what manner &s;he has been able to &s;upply her many and great lo&s;&s;es, and to continue a war, like the pre&s;ent, better than &s;tates more abundant in money. She is be&s;ides, and this is a matter of no &s;mall con&s;equence, &s;upported by the countenance, the authority, and the forces of the Empire. And &s;he has for her allies the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t formidable names in Europe. In the wars which this power carried on in the la&s;t, and in this century, though u&s;ually not very &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;he has always been the la&s;t to de&s;ire a peace; though frequently &s;low in her operations, &s;he makes amends by an extraordinary per&s;everance.</P>
<P>This &s;lowne&s;s could not e&s;cape general ob&s;ervation, in the actions of the la&s;t year. That the Au&s;trians did not play with &s;ufficient &s;pirit, the great game which was in their hands, after the battle of Hochkirchen, and the entry of the Ru&s;&s;ians into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, &s;eems hardly di&s;putable. Perhaps it was that the court of Vienna, by an error common to many courts, but particu|larly &s;o to this, and often fatal to it, interfered too much and too minutely, in the operations of the campaign.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the character of Mar&s;hal Daun him&s;elf, might have had &s;ome &s;hare in this inactivity; a character almo&s;t in all things the direct rever&s;e of that of
<PB N="137" REF="170">
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. He &s;aw that the King, active, re&s;o|lute and advantageous, wa&s;ted him&s;elf even by that activity and &s;pirit, to which he owed his mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Should the Au&s;trians carry on the war in the &s;ame &s;pirit, they might &s;uffer in the &s;ame manner, without being ever able to equal, much le&s;s to exceed that great Monarch, in a &s;tile of action peculiarly his own. Daun therefore by principle, &s;eems to have kept his army from coming to action, in order to oppo&s;e a &s;trength entire, and recruited by a long re&s;t, to that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, wa&s;ted by the efforts it was obliged to make ince&s;&s;antly, and on every &s;ide. His de&s;ign &s;eemed to be, that the i&s;&s;ue of the war &s;hould rather ari&s;e from the general re&s;ult and concurrence of all the operations, gradually producing a &s;olid though a &s;low advantage, than from the effects of a bold, quick, and ma&s;terly &s;troke. In fact, the Au&s;trians felt all the benefits, and all the inconveniencies which u&s;ually attend this &s;ort of conduct, a conduct which probably lo&s;t them Saxony in the la&s;t campaign, and which has &s;ecured them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they now hold in that country. The Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians watched the time and one another, and came very late to action.</P>
<P>The court of Peter&s;burg &s;till adhered to its old &s;y&s;tem, in &s;pite of the late ill &s;ucce&s;s of her arms, and all the ef|forts of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, to withdraw her from her al|liance. If &s;he had &s;ome lo&s;s of men, it was the lea&s;t lo&s;s &s;he could feel: and &s;he thought that whil&s;t the war was carried on at the expence of others, the reduction of &s;o near, &s;o dreaded, and &s;o hated a rival as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the opportunity of the forming her troops to &s;ervice, and perfecting her officers, were objects of con&s;equence enough to keep her clo&s;ely attached to her fir&s;t &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The Swedes pre&s;erved likewi&s;e the &s;ame connexion; but they continued as before, an incon&s;iderable, and inglorious part of the war.</P>
<P>Holland pre&s;erved her neutrality; but it was a neutrality little re&s;pected, and indeed in it&s;elf little re&s;pectable. Di|vided in her councils, attentive only to private intere&s;ts, &s;he di&s;gu&s;ted the Engli&s;h, and neither plea&s;ed nor &s;erved the French. For &s;ome of the &s;ubjects of that republic had car|ried on the trade of France in their bottoms, which &s;ubject|ed them to frequent captures from the Engli&s;h men of war and privateers. This prodoced loud complaints in Holland,
<PB N="138" REF="171">
and warm remon&s;trances to the court of London. The&s;e complaints met with little attention, being in many re&s;pects but indifferently founded. The affair was drawn out in length, until the di&s;pute was extingui&s;hed by the de&s;truction of its object; &s;ome of the French colonies were reduced, and the trade in the others, grown too &s;mall and too hazar|dous to be continued longer with any hope of advantage.</P>
<P>The affairs of France and England were partly connected with the general &s;y&s;tem, and partly di&s;tinct and independent. France perceived that the &s;trength of the Engli&s;h, and the exertion of that &s;trength, increa&s;ed continually in America; &s;he knew from the natural inferiority of her colonies, and the feeble &s;tate of her navy, that &s;he could not in rea&s;on hope for great &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter; for which rea&s;on, although &s;he &s;ent a fleet under Mon&s;. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpart into the We&s;t Indies, and &s;ome men of war, with as many &s;tore and tran&s;port &s;hips as &s;he could &s;teal out of the river St. Law|rence, her great efforts were to be made in Europe; &s;he had two objects, the recovery of Hanover, and the inva&s;ion of the&s;e i&s;lands; in either of which if &s;he &s;ucceeded, there could be no doubt, but that it would prove a &s;ufficient bal|lance for all that &s;he had &s;uffered, or had to apprehend in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t object, though it was difficult to attain it, and though if it &s;hould be attained, it did not promi&s;e to an&s;wer her purpo&s;es &s;o well as the latter, yet it was upon that &s;he chiefly depended. Hitherto in|deed the &s;ucce&s;s which France had in Germany, was not at all proportioned to the prodigious efforts which &s;he made; &s;he began to find her&s;elf much exhau&s;ted. The wants of the French obliged them to pay little re&s;pect to neutral, or even to friendly powers; &s;o that the e&s;teem and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they had in Germany, dimini&s;hed con|tinually. They eat up the country, and &s;eized on &s;uch towns as were convenient to them, without any ceremony: yet freed from all the&s;e re&s;traints, their army had made very little progre&s;s; their generals had not di&s;played any great abilities, and their army, in it&s;elf very badly compo&s;ed, was deficient in di&s;cipline, to a degree which is &s;carcely credible. They kept neither guards nor po&s;ts, nor cen|tinels; a great part of their troops wandered from the camp into the neighbouring towns, and retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned drunk. Their councils of war were held in a tumultuous and di&s;or|derly
<PB N="139" REF="172">
manner; and all their de&s;igns were perfectly known in the camp of the allies, where a very different picture was exhibited, with regard to regularity and caution.</P>
<P>The French troops have &s;everal e&s;&s;ential defects in their con&s;titution, which prevent them from equalling tho&s;e of Germany, and other nations. Several regiments are in a manner hereditary in great families, who placed at their fir&s;t out&s;et at a very high point of military rank, think it unnece&s;&s;ary to attain the qualifications, which lead others to it &s;tep by &s;tep. As to the re&s;t of the officers, as their pay is &s;mall and their hopes littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, few &s;tudy the art military, as a profe&s;&s;ion: they &s;erve becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion to do &s;o, and that it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to be a gentleman. Thus they di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;s as a di&s;agreeable ta&s;k; and having little to lo&s;e in the &s;ervice, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve a due &s;ubordination. The common m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n are little more than abject va&s;&s;als, and therefore want that high &s;pirit which in their gentry makes &s;ome amends for the want of knowledge and a&s;&s;iduity. And as they are corrupted by the example of their &s;uperiors, &s;o by their negligence they are left without any re&s;traint. The officers do not chu&s;e to incur the ill will of their men, or to give them&s;elves trouble, by exerci&s;ing that whol&s;ome &s;everity in which the health and vigour of military di&s;cipline con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The German common people are indeed in a &s;till lower &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage than the French, and might therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed naturally, no better &s;oldiers; but their bodies are more robu&s;t and hardy; their treatment is &s;evere and rigo|rous, their &s;ubordination is mo&s;t exact, which makes their di&s;cipline perfect; and Germany is &s;o habituated to war, that all the people may be &s;aid to be born &s;oldiers. The&s;e things give the Germans a great &s;uperiority over the French; a &s;uperiority which was more vi&s;ible in this, than in any former war.</P>
<P>The&s;e defects in their army were increa&s;ed by the low &s;tate of their finances, which cau&s;ed their troops to be very ill paid. The French court made &s;ome attempts to keep up their credit, by changing their former methods of rai&s;ing money. Mr. Silhoute was made comptroller of the finances, and the farmers general were removed from their former employment of finding the &s;upplies. New methods were divi&s;ed, which might &s;tave off the entire ruin of their finances, until their armies in Germany could &s;trike &s;ome
<PB N="140" REF="173">
effectual blow, or their project of an inva&s;ion, which quieted the minds of the people in &s;ome degree, &s;hould be put in execution.</P>
<P>With regard to the latter project, France had formerly found that the bare report of &s;uch a de&s;ign had &s;erved many material purpo&s;es; but in England things had &s;ince then, been greatly changed. The threats of an inva&s;ion increa&s;|ed our internal &s;trength, without rai&s;ing any apprehen&s;ions; they in a great mea&s;ure executed the militia act, which hardly any thing el&s;e could have put in execution; they increa&s;ed the regular troops, both in their number and their &s;pecies. England for the fir&s;t time &s;aw light hor&s;e and light foot. There reigned in both hou&s;es the mo&s;t perfect and unprecedented union. Among the great men there was no difference that could in the lea&s;t affect the conduct of the war. The di&s;pute concerning the preference of the continental and the marine &s;y&s;tem, was entirely &s;ilenced; becau&s;e a &s;y&s;tem took place which comprehended both, and operated in both as fully as the warme&s;t advocates of either could de&s;ire. Never did England keep a greater number of land forces on foot, on the continent of Europe, in England, in America, when &s;he turned all her power to her land forces only. Never did &s;he cover the &s;eas with &s;uch formidable fleets, when her navy alone engaged her atten|tion. Such is the effect when power and patrioti&s;m unite; when <HI>liberty and order ki&s;s;</HI> and when a nation &s;its with a happy &s;ecurity under the &s;hade of abilities which &s;he has tried, and virtues in which &s;he dares to confide.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;eizing of Francfort in the la&s;t year, by a mo&s;t flagrant violation of the liberties of the Empire, had given the French and their allies the mo&s;t material advan|tage they had acquired in the campaign; for it &s;ecured to
<PB N="141" REF="174">
them the cour&s;e of the Maine, and the Rhine, and made it ea&s;y to them to receive every kind of reinforcement and &s;upply. It &s;ecured likewi&s;e that communication between them, the Imperial, and the Au&s;trian armies, and formed that chain, from which they derived no &s;mall benefit of mutual &s;uccour and concurrence in their operations. Much depended upon their being di&s;lodged from that po&s;t; as well with regard to the fortune of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's army, as to that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Such a &s;troke mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have the greate&s;t influence on the events of the whole en&s;uing campaign. Prince Ferdinand, &s;en&s;ible of this, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted him to enter upon action, drew his troops out of their cantonments; and at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, prepared to di&s;lodge them, before they could receive the &s;upplies, of which they were in daily expectation. The re&s;t of his army, con&s;i&s;ting of about ten or twelve thou&s;and men, were left to guard the electorate, and to watch the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter. Some detachments of Hanoverians and Pru&s;&s;ians had, in the latter end of February, driven the Imperiali&s;ts and Au&s;trians from the po&s;ts, which they occupied at Erfurth and Ei&s;inach, and &s;ome places in the country of He&s;&s;e; this drew a &s;trong body of the enemy into that part, which pu&s;hed them back; but the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, who led the army of the allies through ways, before deemed impa&s;&s;able to an army, defeated them in &s;ome &s;evere &s;kirmi&s;hes; &s;everal places of importance were taken; &s;everal whole battalions were made pri&s;oners, with their officers. The French, alarmed at the vivacity of this beginning, judged it but the prelude to &s;omething more deci&s;ive. Accordingly the Duke of Broglio took an advantageous po&s;t, near Bergen, at a village between Francfort and Hanau, which it was nece&s;|&s;ary the Allies &s;hould ma&s;ter, before they could penetrate to his line. This place he had made his right, and &s;ecured his flanks and centre in &s;uch a manner, that the attack could only be made at that village.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition was the French army when the Allies approached; they formed them&s;elves under an eminence, and began the attack on the village of Bergen, between nine and ten in the morning with great intrepidity. They were received with a very &s;evere fire, which the enemy had prepared for them; they made three attacks in the &s;pace of about two hours, and were every time repul&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="175">Prince Ferdinand now ob&s;erved that the enemy &s;till kept a good countenance in their po&s;t, and that his own troops began to fall into &s;ome di&s;order. This able general, who never ri&s;ques his fortune on a &s;ingle throw, began to think of a retreat, whil&s;t his lo&s;s was yet incon&s;iderable, and the di&s;order of his men ea&s;ily to be repaired. But a retreat in the face of a victorious enemy, was hazardous; and the day was not yet above half &s;pent. In this exigence he made &s;uch movements, as &s;trongly indicated a de&s;ign of falling once more upon the village, in the enemy's right, and of making at the &s;ame time a new attack upon their left. The&s;e appearances were farther countenanced by a cannonode, on both the&s;e po&s;ts, &s;upported with an uncom|mon fury. The French deceived by the&s;e manoeuvres, kept clo&s;e in their po&s;ts; they expected a new and a lively attack every moment; they returned the cannonade as bri&s;kly as they could; and in this po&s;ture things continued until night came on, when the prince made an ea&s;y retreat, without di&s;order, or mole&s;tation, and halted at Windeken.</P>
<P>In this action the lo&s;s of the allies was about two thou&s;and in every way: that of the French was by no means le&s;s con&s;iderable. The allies indeed &s;uffered no|thing in their reputation; their countenance through the whole action having been excellent. Prince Ferdinand gained as much honour, and di&s;played as much &s;kill, as could have been obtained, or &s;hewn upon a more fortunate occa&s;ion. The event however was, in its con&s;equences, far from indifferent; for the allies having mi&s;&s;ed this blow, the French &s;till kept Francfort, and all advantages which they drew from that &s;ituation; they had time and means to receive their reinforcements; and they acquired in a &s;hort &s;pace &s;uch a &s;uperiority, as obliged prince Ferdinand to content him&s;elf with acting on the defen&s;ive, for a long time after.</P>
<P>The advantages which would have ari&s;en from another i&s;&s;ue of that battle appeared more fully, from the operati|ons which were carrying on the &s;ide of Bohemia, and which probably were de&s;igned to concur with tho&s;e of the prince, in &s;ome grand and comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme. There is no doubt, that the army of the allies, and tho&s;e of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, had determined to act in concert, and had &s;ettled &s;ome plan for that purpo&s;e; and though it &s;hould not be di&s;covered with equal certainty, what that plan was,
<PB N="143" REF="176">
it may not however be unplea&s;ant to trace it; as far at lea&s;t as a rea&s;onable conjecture, guided by the lights de|rived from the tendency of each operation, may lead us. For if we &s;ucceed at all, in &s;uch an attempt, it diffu&s;es at wonderful clearne&s;s over the whole narrative.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible then, that it was de&s;igned in the fir&s;t place, to keep the Ru&s;&s;ians at a di&s;tance, until the latter end of the &s;ummer, by the de&s;truction of their magazines in Poland. That on the other &s;ide prince Ferdinand &s;hould attempt to drive the French towards the Rhine, and to get between them and the army of the Empire; which having thus lo&s;t its communication with the French, prince Henry &s;hould ru&s;h out of Saxony, and fall upon them in Bohemia and Franconia, and cut off al&s;o their communication with the great body of the Au&s;trians. Then the Imperiali&s;ts, would find them&s;elves &s;ituated between two ho&s;tile and &s;u|perior armies; whil&s;t in Bohemia, Mar&s;hal Daun would be either obliged to try his fortune &s;ingle handed, with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or totally to abandon that kingdom, into which it was in the power of the Pru&s;&s;ians to enter, in op|po&s;ite parts at once.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this plan was executed with great &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s. So early as the 23d of February the Pru&s;&s;ian general Wober&s;now marched into Poland from Glogau in Sile&s;ia, with forty-&s;ix &s;quadrons, and twenty-nine battalions, where they routed &s;ome bodies of Co&s;&s;acks; and after hav|ing de&s;troyed &s;everal immen&s;e magazines, particularly one at Po&s;en, &s;aid to be &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of fifty thou&s;and men for three months, they retured without any lo&s;s into Sile&s;ia, on the 18th of April.</P>
<P>As for the &s;econd Act of this military drama, it was ex|ecuted with as great &s;ucce&s;s, and with &s;ome advantages more &s;triking than the fir&s;t. Prince Henry commanded the Pru&s;&s;ian troops in Saxony, which the public accounts called forty thou&s;and men. He had certain intelligence, that &s;ome movements, which had purpo&s;ely been made by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, had drawn the greate&s;t part of the Au&s;trian troops, which had been po&s;ted as a watch upon Saxony, towards the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, He immediately took ad|vadtage of this opening, and entered Bohemia in two columns: one marched towards Peter&s;wade:

 <MILESTONE N="April 15."> 

 the other, which was commanded by General Hul&s;en, made its way by Pa&s;berg and Commottau. The
<PB N="144" REF="177">
fir&s;t penetrated as far as Lobo&s;chutz, and Leitmeritz, the enemy flying before them, and every where abandoning or burning the va&s;t magazines which they had ama&s;&s;ed in all tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The body under General Hul&s;en did as much &s;ervice, and it had a more active employment. The pa&s;s of Pa&s;berg, &s;trong in it&s;elf, was defended by a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;trians. General Hul&s;en having conducted his cavalry by another way, &s;o as to fall directly on their rear, attacked them with his infantry in front, and drove them out of all their intrenchments; one general, fifty-one officers, and no le&s;s than two thou&s;and private men, were made pri&s;oners on this occa&s;ion.

 <MILESTONE N="April 22."> 

 The Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t but &s;eventy men killed and wounded They returned into Saxony with ho&s;tages for the contributions they had exacted.</P>
<P>After this fatiguing expedition, the prince gave his troops a few days to re&s;t, and then led them once more to action. He directed his march through the Voigtland, towards the army of the Empire; they entered Franconia by the way of Hoff; they attacked General Macguire, who command|ed a body of Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts. Here they were bravely re&s;i&s;ted for the whole day; but the numbers and &s;pirit of the Pru&s;&s;ians prevailing, Macguire gladly took advantage of the night to make a retreat, having lo&s;t about five hundred men. A few &s;kirmi&s;hes more decided the fate of Franconia. The army of the Empire retreated, as the Pru&s;&s;ians advanced, and abandoned the rich bi&s;hoprics of Bamberg and Wurtzburg to contribution.

 but &s;ome confu&s;ion happening before the capitulation was compleatly fini&s;hed, a party of Croats came to blows with a party of Pru&s;&s;ians, who had by this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the gates; this was re&s;ented as an infringement of the capitulation. A pretence was given to plunder the place; it was given up to pillage, by order of the comman|ders, for two days, in a very unrelenting and licentious manner. This produced loud and ju&s;t complaints again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians, and in due time a &s;evere retaliation. Prince Henry had pu&s;hed back the army of the Empire, as far as Nuremberg; he had di&s;abled a great part of the circle of Franconia from giving them a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and thus far he had accompli&s;hed the objects of his expedition. But as
<PB N="145" REF="178">
that part of the plan, which Prince Ferdinand was to have executed, had ailed, it was impo&s;&s;ible on one hand to hinder the French army from &s;uccouring that of the Empire, or on the other, to prevent a body of Au&s;trians from availing them&s;elves of his ab&s;ence, to penetrate into Saxony. In the&s;e circum&s;tances any farther &s;tay in Franconia was u&s;e|le&s;s, and might be dangerous. His army, loaded with booty and contribution, returned to their old &s;ituation. The Au&s;trians retired into Bohemia at their approach.</P>
<P>Appearances were hitherto favourable enough to the Pru&s;&s;ians: however none of the great ends propo&s;ed by the general plan were fully an&s;wered. The Ru&s;&s;ians, notwith|&s;tanding the de&s;truction of their magazines, continued their march towards Sile&s;ia. Count Dohna, who had rai&s;ed great contributions and levies in the dutchy of Mecklenburg, was preparing to oppo&s;e them on the &s;ide of Brandenburgh; other parties under other commanders, were po&s;ted at tho&s;e places where their irruption was the mo&s;t apprehended. The approach of this army brought things nearer and nearer to a cri&s;is. The eyes of all Europe were fixed with anxiety and expectation on their progre&s;s. It appeared the more formidable, becau&s;e the progre&s;s of the French arms was very rapid after the battle of Bergen.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand finding that another attack was not ad|vi&s;eable, retreated continually. The French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of He&s;&s;e without oppo&s;ition; they met as little in making their way through the bi&s;hoprick of Paderborn; and whil&s;t their grand army, under Mar&s;hal de Contades, pu&s;hed the allies in that quarter and on the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e, M. d'Armentieres was po&s;ted by We&s;el, to advance on that &s;ide as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. The condition of the allied army was extremely dubious; whil&s;t the French increa&s;ed in their numbers and &s;pirit. Their new &s;ucce&s;s gave them rea&s;on to hope for a campaign as fortunate as that of 1757.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>GREAT Britain was not content with the efforts which &s;he had made in Germany: America, the intere&s;ts of which had given ri&s;e to the war, was the object which principally engaged her attention. This was indeed the proper object of her natural &s;trength, and by her &s;ucce&s;s in this quarter, &s;he mo&s;t effectually laid the axe to the root of the enemy's naval power, and cut away one great part of the re&s;ources which fed the war. A &s;quadron of nine &s;hips of the line,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 1758."> 

 with &s;ixty tran&s;ports, con|taining &s;ix regiments of foot, in the end of the la&s;t year, &s;ailed for the We&s;t Indies, in order to attack and reduce the French Caribbee i&s;lands. General Hop&s;on commanded the land forces; the fleet in the ex|pedition was to be under the orders of Commodore Moore, then in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t object was Martinico, the fir&s;t in reputation of the French Caribbees, the &s;eat of government, the centre of all the trade which France carries on with tho&s;e i&s;lands; &s;trong both by nature and art. This i&s;land lies in the 15th degree N. lat. The &s;hore is on every &s;ide indented with very deep bays, which they call Cul de Sacs, and the &s;ands, only di&s;coverable at low water, form in many places a hid|den, and almo&s;t in&s;urmountable barrier. A lofty ridge of almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains, runs north we&s;t and &s;outh ea&s;t quite through the i&s;land; all the &s;pace on both &s;ides is inter|&s;ected at incon&s;iderable di&s;tances with deep gullies, through which the water pours down in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, with great impetuo&s;ity. In other re&s;pects, the i&s;land is plea&s;ant and fruitful; well watered, and well cultivated, abounding with plantations and villages all along the &s;ea coa&s;t. The two principal places are St. Pierre, and Port Royal; both
<PB N="147" REF="180">
town con&s;iderable in this part of the world, for their mag|nitude, trade and &s;trength.</P>
<P>By this &s;hort de&s;cription may be di&s;cerned, how de&s;irable &s;uch a conque&s;t was, and the difficulties which naturally oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to it. They were the greater, becau&s;e at this time there was in the i&s;land a con&s;iderable number of regular troops. They have at all times a numerous and well armed militia, not contemptible for their di&s;cipline, and well &s;uited to the &s;ervice of the country; add to this, that they can bring into the field a large body of negroes, habituated to arms, and in general well affected to the in|tere&s;ts of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h forces landed without oppo&s;ition, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Port Royal harbour, aften the men,

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 6."> 

 of war had driven the enemy from their bat|teries and entrenchments. But on their landing, they found that the nature of the country proved a greater ob&s;truction to their progre&s;s, than the &s;trength of the enemy. The&s;e profound gullies, inclo&s;ed by &s;teep, and almo&s;t per|pendicular precipices, proved an un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the regular march of the troops, or the conveyance of cannon. The enemy had broke up the roads; and five miles of &s;uch roads, and through &s;uch an impracticable country, were to be pa&s;&s;ed before Port Royal could be at|tacked by land. The commander, therefore, of the forces, judged the difficulties on the land-&s;ide in&s;urmountable; the naval commander held it impo&s;&s;ible to put the cannon a&s;hore nearer to the fort. Some jealou&s;y &s;eems to have ari&s;en. The re&s;ult of the whole was, that the forces were reimbarked on the day of their landing.</P>
<P>Very little was done at Port Royal; but it was hoped, that more would be done at St. Pierre. They accordingly &s;et &s;ail for that place; but when they had arrived before it, and examined the coa&s;t,

 <MILESTONE N="19."> 

 new difficul|ties aro&s;e, which produced a new deliberation. They determined that the fort could not be reduced, without &s;uch detriment to the troops and the &s;hipping, that they could afterwards make little u&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s; and in this they had probably good rea&s;on. The conduct of the officers afterwards plainly demon&s;trated, that no mean views had any influence on their councils; they agreed to abandon their enterprize again&s;t Martinico. But having been foiled in this their fir&s;t attempt, they
<PB N="148" REF="181">
re&s;olved not to return with the di&s;grace of having done nothing worthy of the greatne&s;s of the armament, and the expectation of their country. They con&s;idered, that the i&s;land of Guadaloupe was an object, though not of &s;uch an eclat, of full as much real con&s;equence as Martinico; and they knew, that it was neither &s;o &s;trong in troops or forti|fications. Their fir&s;t failure might lead to an advantage, as con&s;iderable as that which they had mi&s;&s;ed. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e re&s;olutions, they &s;et &s;ail for Guadaloupe.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is called Guadaloupe, from a re&s;emblance which it bears to a chain of mountains of the &s;ame name in Old Spain. To &s;peak with exactne&s;s, Guadaloupe is rather to be con&s;idered as two i&s;lands, divided from each other by a &s;mall arm of the &s;ea, or &s;alt-water river, not above three hundred feet over where it is wide&s;t. One of the&s;e i&s;lands is called the Grand Terre; the other more particularly and by di&s;tinction, Guadaloupe; they are to|gether in a circle about ninety leagues. The fir&s;t is nearly de&s;titute of fre&s;h water, and not perfectly cultivated; but it is otherwi&s;e with Guadaloupe. No part of the world is furni&s;hed with more or better. No le&s;s than fifty rivers, in that &s;mall circuit, throw them&s;elves into the &s;ea; many navigable by boats, for two, &s;ome even for three leagues into the country. Not to mention the numberle&s;s &s;prings which ri&s;e among the rocks, and, after a thou&s;and beautiful meanders, lo&s;e them&s;elves in the larger &s;treams. The fir&s;t accounts which we have of that country, are lavi&s;h in the de&s;cription of its beauties; and the late&s;t agree with them, that no part of the We&s;t Indies, perhaps of the world, affords more agreeable and romantic &s;cenes. It is full of high mountains; one of which towers far above the re&s;t, and is a volcano, continually emitting &s;moke and fire. From hence they have con&s;iderable quantities of &s;ulphur. They have al&s;o hot baths, fit for all the medicinal purpo&s;es in which &s;uch waters are u&s;ed. The land in the valleys is extremely fertile; it produces the u&s;ual We&s;t India com|modities, &s;ugar, indigo, coffee, cotton, and ginger: the mountains abound with game: &s;o that there is nothing in the i&s;land wanting, for the convenience and delight of life, in an air more temperate and &s;alubrious than is commonly breathed between the tropics.</P>
<P>The French began to plant colonies in this i&s;land as early as the year 1632. But for a long time this, together with
<PB N="149" REF="182">
all their other colonies, continued in a langui&s;hing condi|tion. It was in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, that they began to emerge. After the peace of Utrecht had given France time to breathe, &s;he turned her attention &s;trongly to the&s;e i&s;lands; Guadaloupe partook however le&s;s of this care than Martinico, and yet, by its natural advan|tages, it does not fall &s;hort of that i&s;land, neither in the quantity, or the goodne&s;s of its produce; if it does not greatly exceed it in both; as it certainly does in its capacity to receive all &s;orts of improvement. The importance of this i&s;land, until its late conque&s;t, was very little known in England. The rea&s;on was this. By an old regulation, the people of Guadaloupe were forbid to trade directly with Europe, but were obliged to &s;end all their produce to Martinico, from whence they had all their European commodities. A &s;trange regulation, to be continued in an age &s;o enlightened as this, by a nation &s;o enlightened as France.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h made attempts upon this i&s;land in 1691, and 1703; but they were neither powerful enough, nor con|ducted with &s;ufficient ability to produce any permanent ef|fect; the troops wa&s;ted the country, and retired with their booty. But on the occa&s;ion, of which we are going to &s;peak, they were more able, &s;trong, and fortunate.</P>
<P>On the 23d of January the fleet came before the town of Ba&s;&s;e Terre, the capital of the i&s;land, a place of con&s;i|derable extent, large trade, and defended by a &s;trong for|tre&s;s. This fortre&s;s, in the opinion of the chief engineer, was not to be reduced by the &s;hipping. But Commodore Moore, notwith&s;tanding this opinion, brought four men of war to bear upon the citadel; the re&s;t were di&s;po&s;ed again&s;t the town, and the batteries which ob&s;tructed the landing. About nine in the morning a fire from all &s;ides began, which continued with the utmo&s;t fury until night, when the citadel, and all the batteries, were effectually &s;ilenced. During this cannonade the bombs, that were continually &s;howered upon the town, &s;et it on fire in &s;everal places. It burned without interruption the whole of this and the fol|lowing day; when it was almo&s;t totally reduced to a&s;hes. The lo&s;s was prodigious from the number of warehou&s;es in the town, full of rich, but combu&s;tible materials. Nothing could be more &s;triking, than the horror of the &s;pectacle,
<PB N="150" REF="183">
from the mutual and unremitted fire of &s;o many great &s;hips and batteries, heightened with a long line of flames, which extended along the &s;hore, and formed the back ground of this terrible picture.</P>
<P>In this lively engagement, our lo&s;s was very incon&s;idera|ble. The next day the forces landed without oppo&s;ition,

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 24."> 

 and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town and citadel. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;ucce&s;s, the i&s;land was far from being reduced. The country is rugged and mountainous, and abounded with pa&s;&s;es and defiles, of a difficult and dangerous nature. The inhabitants had retired with their armed negroes into the mountains; and all &s;eemed prepared to defend their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions bravely, and to the la&s;t extremities.</P>
<P>General Hop&s;on died on the 27th of February, and Ge|neral Barrington &s;ucceeded him. He embarked part of his forces for the Grand Terre, where Colonel Crump attack|ed and reduced the towns of St. Anne, and St. Francois; whil&s;t this attack diverted the enemy's attention, the Gene|ral fell upon the &s;trong po&s;t of Go&s;ier, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of it; and thus the Grand Terre was in a manner re|duced, and di&s;abled from &s;ending any relief to the other part.</P>
<P>There is a con&s;iderable mountain, not far from the town of Ba&s;&s;e Terre, called Dos d'A&s;ne, or the A&s;&s;e's Back; thi|ther a great part of the enemy had retired. It is a po&s;t of great &s;trength, and great importance, as it keeps a watch upon the town, and at the &s;ame time forms the only com|munication there is between that town, and the Capes Terre, the plaine&s;t, plea&s;ante&s;t, and mo&s;t fruitful part of the whole i&s;land. It was not judged practicable to break into it by this way; and all the re&s;t of Guadaloupe was in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Therefore a plan was formed for another operation, by which it was propo&s;ed to &s;urprize Petit Bourg, Goyave, and St. Mary's, and by that way to march into Capes Terre, which might be ea&s;ily reduced. But this de&s;ign failing, it was nece&s;&s;ary to attempt tho&s;e places by main force. Col. Clavering and Col. Crump landed near Arnonville, and attacked the enemy, &s;trongly intrenched at a po&s;t, &s;trong by nature, called Le Corne. This was forced; another intrenchment at Petit Bourg had the &s;ame fate; a third near St. Mary's yielded in the &s;ame manner. An opening being at la&s;t made into the Capes

Terre, the inhabitants &s;aw, that the be&s;t part of the coun|try was on the point of being given up to fire and &s;word; they came in and capitulated; their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,

 and their civil and religious liberties were granted to them.</P>
<P>Three &s;mall i&s;lands, near Guadaloupe, De&s;eada, Santos and Petite Terre,

 <MILESTONE N="19th."> 

 &s;urrendered a few days after, and on the &s;ame terms.</P>
<P>This capitulation was hardly &s;igned, when the French &s;quadron under M. Bompart appeared before the i&s;land, and landed at St. Anne's, in the Grand Terre, the Gene|ral of the French Caribbees, with &s;ix hundred regular troops, two thou&s;and buccaneers, and a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The capitulation was made at the mo&s;t critical time; for had this reinforcement arrived but a day &s;ooner, the whole expedition had probably been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Great Britain, this valuable i&s;land, after a campaign of near three months, in which the Engli&s;h troops behaved with a firmne&s;s, cou|rage and per&s;everance, that ought never to be forgotten, Intolerable heat, continual fatigue, the air of an unaccu&s;|tomed climate, a country full of lofty mountains and &s;teep precipices, po&s;ts &s;trong by nature and by art, defended by men who fought for every thing that was dear to them; all the&s;e difficulties only increa&s;ed the ardour of our forces, who thought nothing impo&s;&s;ible under commanders, who were not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for their intrepidity and &s;kill, than their zeal for the &s;ervice of their country, and the perfect harmony and good under&s;tanding that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween them. There is nothing perhaps &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to in|&s;pire confidence into the &s;oldier, as to ob&s;erve that the of|ficers have a perfect confidence in one another

<P><PB N="152" REF="185">It mu&s;t not be omitted, that many of the inhabitants exerted them&s;elves very gallantly in the defence of their country. A woman, a con&s;iderable planter in the i&s;land,

<HEAD>(a) The Hon. Gen. <HI>Barrington</HI>'s Letter to the Right Hon. Mr. Secre|tary <HI>Pitt,</HI> particulari&s;ing his proceedings at <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> <DATE><HI>May 9, 1759.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter of the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> I had the honour to ac|quaint you, that the troops under my command at <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> (except the garri&s;on of Fort <HI>Royal</HI>) were all embarked, with
<PB N="152" REF="185">
their baggage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without the lo&s;s of a man. The fleet &s;ailed the next morning for Fort <HI>Louis,</HI> but from the very great difficul|ty of turning to windward, were not able to reach it till the 11th, at four in the afternoon, when all the &s;hips of war, but only 25 of the tran&s;ports, came to an anchor; the others were either driven much to leeward, or prevented by the winds and &s;trong currents from weathering the point of <HI>Saintes.</HI></P>
<P>I went on &s;hore at Fort <HI>Louis</HI> that evening to &s;ee the Fort, and the works carrying on by the detachment that had already been &s;ent thither from <HI>Ba&s;&s;eterre.</HI></P>
<P>On the 12th, I went in a boat to reconnoitre the two coa&s;ts of this Bay, as well the <HI>Grand Terre</HI> &s;ide, as that of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> to find a proper place for making a de&s;cent; but Commodore <HI>Moore</HI> having acquainted me in the evening of that day, that he had re|ceived certain intelligence of a <HI>French</HI> &s;quadron of &s;kips of war, con&s;i&s;ting of nine &s;ail of the line and two frigates, being &s;een to the northward of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and that it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for him to quit this place, with all the &s;hips of war under his com|mand, and go into <HI>Prince Rupert's Bay,</HI> in the i&s;land of <HI>Dominico,</HI> as a &s;ituation more advantageous for the protection of <HI>Ba&s;&s;eterre,</HI> and this place, as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> i&s;lands; I thought it advi&s;e|able the next day to call together the General Officers to con&s;ider what, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, was be&s;t to be done, and it was determined; notwith&s;tanding the divided &s;tate of the troops by the &s;eparation of the tran&s;ports, the weak &s;tate of Fort <HI>Louis,</HI> and the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upplying it with water but from the &s;hips, and the many difficulties which then appeared, that it would be mo&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and the honour of his arms, to do the utmo&s;t to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fort, and to wait &s;ome further intelligence of the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>Commodore <HI>Moore</HI> &s;ailed the next morning for <HI>Prince Rupert's Bay,</HI> with all the &s;hips of war, except the <HI>Roebuck</HI> of 40 guns, which he left, as &s;ome protection to the tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>From this time to the 17th, I continued to direct works to be made for the &s;ecurity of the camp, and for the fini&s;hing, as well as &s;trengthening the lines, when, the chief engineer, who was on board one of the tran&s;ports that could not before get up, being arrived, and having made to me a report of the weakne&s;s of the Fort, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to call a council of war to con&s;ider the &s;tate thereof; and it being debated whether the Fort might
<PB N="153" REF="186">
not be made tenable, and kept as a garri&s;on for his Maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice, on a more circum&s;cribed plan, though it appeared impo&s;&s;i|ble to keep it in the pre&s;ent extent of out-po&s;ts; it was determin|ed, after much con&s;ideration, that from its weakne&s;s and bad con|&s;truction, its being commanded by &s;everal heights very contiguous to it, as well as the great difficulty (I may indeed &s;ay the impo&s;&s;i|bility) of procuring for the pre&s;ent, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a con&s;tant &s;upply of water, and other more nece&s;&s;ary things for the &s;upport and defence of a garri&s;on in this part of the world, not to be te|nable. However, Sir, I was, determined to hold it, until &s;ome future event might convince me what was be&s;t to be done for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I reflected on the &s;tate of the army under my command, and of the little probability there was of &s;ucceeding in any attempt of reducing the country by the troops I had, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;hips of war to cover them in landing. But however I de|termined to make a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of <HI>Grand Terre;</HI> and for that purpo&s;e I ordered Col. <HI>Crump,</HI> with a detachment con&s;i&s;ting of 600 men, to go in &s;ome of the tran&s;ports that carried mo&s;t guns, and endeavour to land between the towns of St. <HI>Anne</HI> and St. <HI>Francois,</HI> and de&s;troy the batteries and cannon, which was happily executed with very little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>As I imagined by my &s;ending Col. <HI>Crump</HI> to attack the towns of St. <HI>Anne</HI> and St. <HI>Francois,</HI> the enemy would be obliged to detach &s;ome of their troops from the po&s;t of <HI>Go&s;ier,</HI> I ordered, two days after he &s;ailed, the only 300 men I had left to be put on board tran&s;ports, and lye off that town; and in the morning of the 29th, I went to reconnoitre the battery and intrenchments, and per|ceiving that the enemy appeared le&s;s numerous than for &s;ome time before, I made a di&s;po&s;ition for forcing them by two different at|tacks. This was executed the next morning at &s;un-ri&s;ing, with great &s;pirit and re&s;olution by the troops; and notwith&s;tanding the fire of the enemy from their intrenchments and battery, both were &s;oon carried with little lo&s;s, and the enemy drove into the woods. The troops immediately de&s;troyed the cannon and battery, with the town.</P>
<P>This being happily effected, I ordered the detachment to force its way to Fort <HI>Louis;</HI> and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent orders for the
<PB N="154" REF="187">
garri&s;on to make two &s;allies, one to the right, in order to put the enemy between two fires, and the other to attack their lines, as I knew that which I had ju&s;t made would oblige them to &s;end troops to oppo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age on that &s;ide. The fir&s;t was made, but the latter, by &s;ome mi&s;take, was not executed; which, had it been done, we mu&s;t have inevitably been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lines. The detachment from <HI>Go&s;ier</HI> forced their pa&s;&s;age with &s;ome lo&s;s, notwith&s;tanding a very &s;trong pa&s;s that the enemy were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a battery of three 24-pounders, which would, the next day, have played upon our camp.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>De&s;bri&s;ay,</HI> whom I had left at Fort <HI>Royal</HI> in <HI>Ba&s;&s;eter|re,</HI> having been killed by the blowing up of &s;ome cartridges that took fire from the wadding of a 24-pounder that was di&s;charged from the upper ba&s;tion of Fort <HI>Royal,</HI> at a body of the enemy, on the 23d of <HI>March,</HI> I appointed Major <HI>Melvill,</HI> who command|ed the detachment of the 38th regiment from the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands,</HI> to be governor in his room. Major <HI>Trollone,</HI> a lieut. of the 63d regiment, and two private men, were likewi&s;e killed by this ac|cident; and a capt. another lieut. and 3 men wounded: And the parapet of that ba&s;tion levelled with the ground by the explo|&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I was acquainted with this accident, I was told, that the enemy had erected a bomb-battery, and thrown &s;everal &s;hells into the fort; and that they had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been working, as the garri&s;on &s;u&s;pected, upon another bat|tery; I therefore ordered Govenor <HI>Melvill</HI> to cau&s;e a &s;ortie (&s;ally) to be made from the garri&s;on in order to de&s;troy it. Ac|cordingly a detachment of 300 men &s;allied out under the com|mand of Capt. <HI>Blomer,</HI> on the 1&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> and without much difficulty forced the enemy's intrenchments, and got into the work, which proved to be a battery of one 18-pounder, and one 12 nearly compleated. Our people &s;piked the guns, and returned to the garri&s;on with the lo&s;s of only &s;ix men killed, and &s;ix wound|ed.</P>
<P>As I thought the fort, by this accident, might want the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the chief engineer, I &s;ent him thither immediately, as well as the commanding officer of the artillery, that no time might be lo&s;t in putting it again in a proper &s;tate of defence.</P>
<P>The remaining part of the tran&s;ports, with the troops, being
<PB N="155" REF="188">
now arrived; nine having come on the 23d of <HI>March,</HI> and the others by one or two in a day; as I had long intended, &s;o &s;oon as it was in my power to make an attack on the <HI>Gaudaloupe</HI> &s;ide, as the enemy had there &s;ome po&s;ts of infinite con&s;equence, I form|ed, upon the information of &s;ome <HI>Negroes,</HI> who promi&s;ed to con|duct the troops in flat-bottom boats by night, a de&s;ign of &s;urpriz|ing <HI>Petit Bourg. Guoyave,</HI> and St. <HI>Marie</HI>'s, at the &s;ame time. The fir&s;t was to be effected by Brig. <HI>Crump,</HI> who, the moment he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, was to march to bay <HI>Mahaut,</HI> and de&s;troy the batteries there, as well as a large magazine of provi&s;i|ons that the enemy had collected from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to hinder any more arriving: The latter, under Brig. <HI>Clavering,</HI> after he had &s;urpri&s;ed St. <HI>Marie</HI>'s and <HI>Guoyave,</HI> was to march into the <HI>Cape&s;terre,</HI> and reduce that fine country. The &s;ucce&s;s of this ap|peared not only to me, but to the gentlemen who were to exe|cute it, almo&s;t infallible: But the night proved &s;o bad, and the <HI>Negroe</HI> conductors were &s;o frightened, that they run &s;everal of the boats on the &s;hoals, of which that coa&s;t is full; &s;o that tho' Brig. <HI>Clavering</HI> did land with about 80 men, yet the place was &s;o full of mangroves, and &s;o deep in mud, that he was obliged to return, but not without the enemy's di&s;covering our de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This obliged me to attempt by force, what could not be effect|ed upon a &s;afer plan: But as I then was laid up in a mo&s;t &s;evere fit of the gout in my feet, head, and &s;tomach, I &s;ent Brigadiers <HI>Clavering</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> to reconnoitre the coa&s;t near <HI>Arnoville;</HI> and upon their report, I ordered 1300 regulars, and 150 of the <HI>Antigua</HI> volunteers, to land under the protection of the Wool|wich man of war: What happened afterwards, you will &s;ee by the following letter which I received at <HI>Petit Bourg</HI> from Brig. <HI>Clavering,</HI> on the 25th of <HI>April.</HI></P>

<HEAD>At M. Poyen's, Cape&s;terre, Gaudaloupe, <DATE>April <HI>24, 1759.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 12th of <HI>April,</HI> at day-break, I landed with the troops which you put under my orders, con&s;i&s;ting of 1300 men, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Antigua</HI> volunteers, at a Bay not far di&s;tant from <HI>Arnoville.</HI> The enemy made no oppo&s;ition to our
<PB N="156" REF="189">
landing, but retired, as our troops advanced, to very &s;trong in|trenchments behind the river <HI>Le Corn.</HI> This po&s;t was to them of the greate&s;t importance, as it covered the whole country to the bay <HI>Mahaut,</HI> where the provi&s;ions and &s;upplies of all &s;orts were land|ed from St. <HI>Eu&s;tatia,</HI> and therefore they had very early taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and had &s;pared no pains to &s;trengthen it, though the &s;ituation was &s;uch as required very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. The river was only acce&s;&s;ible at two narrow pa&s;&s;es, on account of a mora&s;s covered with mangroves, and tho&s;e places they had occupied with a redoubt and well palli&s;aded intrenchments, de|fended with cannon, and all the militia of that part of the coun|try. We could only approach them in a very contracted front, which was at lea&s;t reduced to the breadth of the roads, inter&s;ect|ed with deep and wide ditches. Our artillery, which con&s;i&s;ted of four field pieces and two hawbitzers, were ordered to keep a con|&s;tant fire on the top of the intrenchments, to cover the attack made by <HI>Duroure</HI>'s regiment and the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> who, on this occa&s;ion, behaved with the greate&s;t coolne&s;s and re&s;olution, keep|ing up, as they advanced, a regular platoon firing. This behavi|our &s;o intimidated the enemy, that they abandoned the fir&s;t in|trenchment on the left, into which the <HI>Highlanders</HI> threw them|&s;elves, &s;word in hand, and pur&s;ued the enemy, with part of <HI>Du|roure</HI>'s regiment, into the redoubt.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;till kept their ground at their intrenchments on the right, from whence they annoyed our people very much, both with mu&s;quetry and cannon; and though tho&s;e who had carried the fir&s;t intrenchments had got into their rear, yet, till a bridge could be made to pa&s;s the river, they could not get round to at|tack this po&s;t. This took us up near half an hour; but however we got up time enough to take near 70 of the enemy pri&s;o|ners, as they were endeavouring to make their e&s;cape, among&s;t whom were &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable inhabitants of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>We found in both the intrenchments &s;ix pieces of cannon. Our lo&s;s was one officer and 13 men killed, and two officers and 52 men wounded.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the ditches could be filled up for the pa&s;&s;age of the artillery, we proceeded on our march towards <HI>Petit Bourg.</HI> A con&s;iderable number of the enemy had lined an intrenchment
<PB N="157" REF="190">
about half a mile on the left of the road, but when they perceived we were endeavouring to &s;urround them, they abandoned it, keeping always about 200 yards in our front, &s;etting fire to the &s;ugar-canes, which obliged us more than once to leave the road, to avoid any accident to our powder.</P>
<P>The troops arrived late on the banks of the river <HI>Lezard,</HI> be|hind which, at the only ford, the enemy had thrown up very &s;trong intrenchments, protected with four pieces of cannon on the hill behind them.</P>
<P>Having reconnoitred the &s;ide of the river, and finding it might co&s;t us very dear to force the pa&s;&s;age at the ford, I therefore kept up their attention all the night by firing into their lines, during which time I got two Canoes conveyed about a mile and a half down the river, where being launched, we ferryed over, before break of day in the morning, a &s;ufficient number of men to at|tack them in flank, whil&s;t we &s;hould do the &s;ame in front: The enemy &s;oon perceived their danger, and left their intrenchments with the greate&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>Thus we pa&s;&s;ed without the lo&s;s of a man, &s;till pur&s;uing them to <HI>Petit Bourg,</HI> 
which place they had fortified with lines, and a redoubt filled with cannon.</P>
<P>We found Capt. <HI>Uvedale</HI> there, in the <HI>Granada</HI> bomb, throw|ing &s;hells into the Fort. The enemy did not remain in it long, when they &s;aw our intention of occupying the heights round them, but left us ma&s;ters of that, and the Port, with all the cannon round the place.</P>
<P>We halted here the 14th, to get provi&s;ions for the troops.</P>
<P>On the 15th, at day break, Brig. <HI>Crump</HI> was detached with 700 men to the bay <HI>Mahaut,</HI> and at the &s;ame time Capt. <HI>Steel</HI> with 100 to <HI>Guoyave,</HI> about 7 miles in our front, to de&s;troy a battery there. The panick of the enemy was &s;uch, that they only di&s;charged their cannon at him, and abandoned a po&s;t that might have been defended again&s;t an army. He nailed up 7 pie|ces of cannon, and returned the &s;ame evening to <HI>Petit Bourg,</HI> Brig. <HI>Crump</HI> returned likewi&s;e the next day with his detachment from the bay <HI>Mahaut,</HI> where he found the town and batteries abandoned. The&s;e he burnt, with an immen&s;e quantity of provi|&s;ions, that had been landed there by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and reduced the whole country, as far as <HI>Petit Bourg.</HI></P>
<PB N="158" REF="191">
<P>The heavy rains on the &s;ucceeding days had &s;o &s;welled the ri|vers, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the troops to advance; however, this delay gave us an opportunity of &s;trengthening the po&s;t a <HI>Petit Bourg.</HI></P>
<P>On the 18th in the evening, the <HI>Antigua</HI> volunteers took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion again of <HI>Guoyave;</HI> they were &s;upported early the next morn|ing by a detachment commanded by Lieut. Col. <HI>Barlow,</HI> who had orders to repair the road for the pa&s;&s;age of the cannon.</P>
<P>On the 20th, after leavin 250 men to guard <HI>Petit Bourg,</HI> the remaining part of the detachment, with the cannon, moved on to <HI>Guoyave,</HI> in order to proceed afterwards to St. <HI>Marie</HI>'s, where we were informed the enemy were collecting their whole force to oppo&s;e us, and had likewi&s;e thrown up intrenchments, and made barricadoes on the road to prevent our approach to it. We were not long before we perceived them; but, at the &s;ame time, we found, as well by our own ob&s;ervation, as by the information of the guides, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible to get into their rear by roads the enemy thought impracticable, and con&s;equently had guarded with very little care.</P>
<P>A detachment was immediately formed under Col. <HI>Barlow,</HI> for this &s;ervice, and orders were &s;ent to ha&s;ten the march of the ar|tillery, which, from the badne&s;s of the roads, had not been able to get up. The fir&s;t &s;hot from our cannon, placed very near their intrenchment, with the alarm that was given by our detachment in the rear, made the enemy very &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous &s;ituation they were in, and indeed their precipitate flight only &s;a|ved them from being all taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued them as far as the heights of St. <HI>Marie</HI>'s, where we again formed our men, for a fre&s;h attack on the lines and bat|teries there.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the barricadoes were levelling for the artillery, we at|tempted a &s;econd time to pa&s;s the woods and precipices that co|vered the flanks of the enemy's lines; but, before we could get up our cannon, they perceived our movement, and began to quit their lines to oppo&s;e it, which made us re&s;olve, without any further delay, to attack them immediately in front; and it was accord|ingly executed with the greate&s;t vivacity, notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;tant firing of both their cannon and mu&s;quetry. They abandon|ed here all their artillery, and went off in &s;o much confu&s;ion, that they never afterwards appeared before us.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="192">
<P>We took up our quarters at St. <HI>Marie</HI>'s that night, and the next day entered the <HI>Cape&s;terre,</HI> which is the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful part of this or any other country in the We&s;t Indies. Eight hundred and &s;eventy <HI>Negroes,</HI> belonging to one man only &s;urrendered this day.</P>
<P>Here Me&s;&s;. <HI>de Glainvilliers</HI> and <HI>Duqueruy,</HI> deputed by the principal inhabitants of the I&s;land, met me to know the terms you would grant them; and, as I accompanied them to <HI>Petit Bourg</HI> the next day, and there pre&s;ented them to you, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to mention any tran&s;action &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, conclude, without doing ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, to who&s;e merit is due the &s;ucce&s;s that has attended the King's arms on this occa&s;ion; I mean the &s;pirit and con&s;tancy of the troops: To Brig. <HI>Crump,</HI> without who&s;e concurrence, I never undertook any thing, but chiefly to your&s;elf, Sir, who planned the whole en|terprize, and who furni&s;hed me with all the&s;e means, without which, neither bravery or prudence can little avail.</P>

<P>I Have the &s;atisfaction to inform you, that by great per&s;eve|rance, and changing entirely the nature of the war, by carry|ing it on by detachments, I have at length made my&s;elf ma&s;ter of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> and <HI>Grand Terre.</HI> This is a work, Sir, that, I be|lieve, the mo&s;t &s;anguine (con&s;idering our total &s;eparation from the fleet) could not expect to have been performed by &s;o &s;mall a body of men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in this trouble you with a detail, as I have done my|&s;elf the honour of &s;ending it to you in my other letter. I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, that the great good conduct and zeal of Bri|gadiers <HI>Clavering</HI> and <HI>Crump,</HI> and the bravery of the troops, got the better of every ob&s;tacle; forced the enemy in all their in|trenchments,

and &s;trong pa&s;&s;es; took 50 pieces of cannon, and advanced as far as the <HI>Cape&s;terre,</HI> the only remaining unreduced part of the country. This at la&s;t brought the enemy to terms. My &s;ituation was &s;uch, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that what was done &s;hould not be procra&s;tinated, as I was determined to grant no truce for time enough for the inhabitants to recover from their fears. Mr. Moore was ab&s;ent, the thing pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome re&s;olution was to be taken immediately. That, which I took, was according to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding, and I hope, Sir, you will approve of it.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, the infinite con&s;equence and value of <HI>Guada|loupe,</HI> and <HI>Grand Terre,</HI> is not perfectly known in <HI>England,</HI> as (if I am rightly informed) there is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugar grown here than in all the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands</HI> put together; be&s;ides great quantities of cotton and coffee. The country, e&s;pecially the <HI>Cape&s;terre,</HI> the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw, watered with good rivers every mile or two; and a port belonging to it, where all the navy of <HI>England</HI> may ride &s;afe from hurricanes. All this can be explained much better, than I can by letter, by Brig. <HI>Clavering,</HI> who&s;e infinite zeal for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and talents as a &s;oldier, I hope will recommend him to protection. Such men are rare; and I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, there are few things in our profe&s;&s;i|on, that he is not equal to, if it &s;hould be thought fit to honour him with the execution of any future commands.</P>
<PB N="161" REF="196">
<P>I have appointed Col. <HI>Crump</HI> to the government, who, &s;ince governor <HI>Haldane</HI> left us, I have made act as Brigadier: His merit is very great, both as a &s;oldier, and a man of judgment; He is of this part of the world; under&s;tands the trade, cu&s;toms, and genius of the people; and as he thinks nobly and de&s;intere&s;t|edly, he would not have accepted of the government, but in hopes of advancing him&s;elf in the army by that means. I cannot &s;ay, how very u&s;eful, and how much our &s;ucce&s;&s;es are owing to his good conduct, and great zeal.</P>
<P>As I have now nothing to fear from the land, I am repairing, as well as I can, Fort <HI>Louis,</HI> and fortifying the i&s;le of <HI>Cochon,</HI> for the greater &s;ecurity of the harbour. The poor people here are in a mi&s;erable condition, but I &s;hall do every thing in my power to procure them the things they want.</P>
<P>I have the honour to &s;end you inclo&s;ed the capitulation of the governor, as well as that of the inhabitants. The latter have be|haved, in all their dealings, with great candour; and it is a ju&s;tice I owe them, to acquaint you with it.</P>
<P>It has not as yet been po&s;&s;ible for me to go round ths i&s;land to &s;ee the different po&s;ts that mu&s;t be occupied, I therefore cannot yet determine the exact number of troops that will be nece&s;&s;ary to be left for their defence.</P>
<P>The great a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have received from Capt. <HI>Lynn,</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oebuck,</HI> in the different &s;ervices I have been carrying on for the reduction of the&s;e i&s;lands, ought not to be for|got by me, as well as his fir&s;t Lieutenant, Mr. <HI>Keating;</HI> both whom I beg leave to recommend to your favour.</P>
<P>I find it is impo&s;&s;ible (from the different parts of the I&s;lands where they are to be received) for me to procure a return of the artillery and &s;tores (which have been delivered up, in con&s;equence of the capitulation) to &s;end by this opportunity; but I hope to be able to have the Honour of &s;ending it very &s;oon.</P>
<P>I cannot help congratulating my&s;elf, that I had ju&s;t &s;igned the capitulation with the inhabitants of the <HI>Grand Terre,</HI> when a me&s;|&s;enger arrived in their camp to acquaint them, that M. <HI>Beauhar|nois,</HI> the general of the&s;e i&s;lands, had landed at <HI>St. Anne</HI>'s, on the windward part of that i&s;land, with a reinforcement from <HI>Mar|tinico,</HI> of 600 regulars, 2000 buccaneers, and 2000 &s;tand of &s;pare arms for the inhabitants, with artillery and mortars, under

precautions of the Prince proved al&s;o ineffectual to retard the progre&s;s of their arms. Ritberg was &s;urpri&s;ed, Lip&s;tadt was blockaded, Minden was taken by a&s;&s;ault, where a gar|ri&s;on of 1500 men were made pri&s;oners, and where immen&s;e magazines fell into their hands. D'Armentieres advanced again&s;t Mun&s;ter; he attempted to take the place by a coup de main. Though foiled in his attempt with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, he did not de&s;i&s;t; he drew up his cannon from We&s;el, and after a &s;hort &s;iege,

 <MILESTONE N="July 25."> 

 made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city; the garri&s;on of 4000 men, became his pri&s;oners. Nothing &s;eemed able to with&s;tand the rapid torrent with which the French over-ran the whole country; they no longer hoped, the conque&s;t of Hanover; it was with them an ab&s;olute certainty. Elated with the fair appearance of their fortune, they kept no bounds. The French mini&s;ter, the Duke of Bellci&s;le, in his letters to the Mar&s;hal Contades, &s;peaks only of the means of &s;ecuring their conque&s;t, and preventing another expul&s;ion from Ha|nover; and for this end propo&s;ed the mo&s;t cruel and un|warrantable expedients. Nor was there le&s;s dread and de|jection vi&s;ible on the &s;ide of the allies, than pride and con|fidence on that of the French. The archives and mo&s;t va|luable moveables were &s;ent off from Hanover to Stade. All things &s;eemed ha&s;tening to the &s;ame po&s;ture which drew on the famous capitulation of Clo&s;ter Seven.</P>
<P>In this general gloom that over&s;pread the fortune of the allies, the Prince kept him&s;elf unmoved and attentive to his de&s;igns. He did not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be di&s;concerted by blows, which he had probably fore&s;een, and the ill con&s;e|quences of which he knew how to prevent. The body of the French army after the taking of Minden, had po&s;ted them&s;elves near the city, to which the right of their army extended; their left was protected by a very &s;teep hill; in their front was a large mora&s;s; and a rivulet covered their rear. Nothing could be more advantageous than this &s;itua|tion; and whil&s;t they continued in it, nothing could be en|terpri&s;ed again&s;t them. The army of the allies, after a con|tinued retreat, began at la&s;t to advance, and fixed their
<PB N="164" REF="200">
camp altogether as advantageou&s;ly at Peter&s;hagen, a place about three leagues from the enemy.</P>
<P>Things were brought to that pa&s;s, that nothing but a battle could hinder the French from taking winter quarters in the electorate. There was no po&s;&s;ibility of attacking them with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s in the camp which they then occupied. The point was to draw them from that po&s;t in|to the plain; but the movements nece&s;&s;ary to effect this were extremely hazardous to an inferior army, in &s;ight of the enemy. The operations of Prince Ferdinand, on this occa&s;ion, di&s;played &s;o penetrating and uncommon a genius, &s;uch a guarded boldne&s;s, &s;uch a certainty of the grounds he went upon, &s;uch a perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, that per|haps there is no in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of general&s;hip &s;o com|pleat and fini&s;hed; for which rea&s;on we &s;hall endeavour from the be&s;t lights we have, to draw out at length the &s;everal parts that concurred to form this remarkable piece; we could indeed wi&s;h that the authentick accounts of &s;o ve|ry memorable an event, had been more clear and explicit; but we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with the materials we have.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July, Prince Ferdinand for&s;ook his camp on the We&s;er, and marched towards Hillen, a village con|&s;iderably to his right, with the greate&s;t part of his army: However he took care to leave on the brink of that river, a body under General Wangenheim; which extended to the town of Thornhau&s;en, where they were intrenched, and &s;upported by a con&s;iderable artillery. He had the day be|fore detached the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;|wick,

 <MILESTONE N="July 28."> 

 with 6000 men, to make a compa&s;s to|wards the enemy's left flank, and to po&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to cut off the communication of their convoys from Paderborn.</P>
<P>The French were not inattentive to the&s;e movements; their Generals immediately held a council of war; and the re&s;ult was, that they gave completely into the &s;nare that was laid for them. They &s;aw, as they imagined, the allied army divided and disjointed; and now the happy moment pre&s;ented it&s;elf, for the attack of General Wangenheim, who they knew was not &s;trong, and who &s;eemed at a great di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the army, &s;o that it appeared im|po&s;&s;ible that he could be relieved. This body being routed, as it ea&s;ily might, it was obvious that they &s;hould then be able to place them&s;elves between Prince Ferdinand's army
<PB N="165" REF="201">
and the We&s;er, and cut off his communication with that river; the great object at which they aimed, through the whole campaign, and in which was involved the certain de|&s;truction of the allies.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e ideas they left their advantageous po&s;t, and in eight columns pa&s;&s;ed the mora&s;s in their front,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 1."> 

 and advanced into the plain. The Duke of Brog|lio was to lead the attack, by falling upon that body that lay near the river, which &s;eemed to pre&s;ent him an a&s;&s;ured and ea&s;y victory. He marched on, therefore, with great confidence; but as &s;oon as he had gained an eminence which lay along his front, he was &s;truck with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, when, in&s;tead of a few po&s;ts weakly guarded, he beheld the whole army of the allies drawn up in excellent order, ex|tending from the banks of the We&s;er, quite to the mora&s;s, in the front of the late French camp. This was a &s;troke en|tirely unexpected; they believed the Prince to have been at Hillen; but he had marched up, and the whole army was joined in the night. This di&s;covery for a while put a &s;top to the motions of the French; they were hemmed in be|tween the allies, the mora&s;s and the river. Their &s;ituation was di&s;agreeable, but it was now impo&s;&s;ible to recede.</P>
<P>The allies, finding the French &s;lower than they expect|ed, began to advance, and threatened the enemy's centre. This was compo&s;ed almo&s;t wholly of hor&s;e; but it was the flower of their cavalry, who anticipated the &s;hock of the allies, and began the engagement. The brunt of the battle was almo&s;t wholly &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h infantry, and &s;ome corps of Hanoverians, which &s;tood the re-iterated charges of &s;o many bodies of hor&s;e, the &s;trength and glory of the French armies, with a re&s;olution, &s;teadine&s;s, and expertne&s;s in their manoeuvre, which was never exceeded, perhaps never equalled. They cut to pieces or entirely routed the&s;e bodies. Two brigades of foot attempted to &s;upport them, but they vani&s;hed before the Engli&s;h infantry. Waldegrave's and King&s;ley's regiments di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in a particular manner this day; nor were their com|manders le&s;s di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tingui&s;hed. The enemy's hor&s;e, which compo&s;ed their centre, being entirely di&s;comfited, and their right, which attacked Wangenheim, having made no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion, they thought of nothing but a retreat.</P>
<P>At this point of time the Prince &s;ent orders to Ld. George Sackville, who commanded the whole Briti&s;h, and &s;everal
<PB N="166" REF="202">
brigades of the German cavalry, to advance. That caval|ry formed the right wing of the allies, extended to the mo|ra&s;s, and if it could have charged at the in&s;tance of the ene|my's retreat, &s;uch a &s;hock at that time, and in that &s;itua|tion, would in all probability have left the French without an army in Germany. But the orders were not &s;ufficiently preci&s;e, or they were not &s;ufficiently under&s;tood by the En|gli&s;h commander; &s;o that there was &s;ome delay in waiting for an explanation. The critical minute pa&s;&s;ed away; the Briti&s;h cavalry lo&s;t their &s;hare in the glory of the action; and the French retreated in &s;ome order, favoured by the &s;piri|ted and well-judged efforts of the Duke of Broglio, and the advantages which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Minden gave them.</P>
<P>What is remarkable, the French attributed their misfor|tune in this battle to the &s;ame error in their di&s;po&s;ition, which lo&s;t them the battle of Blenheim; that of compo&s;ing their centre almo&s;t wholly of cavalry, without any proper &s;up|port of foot.</P>
<P>The battle was over; but then it was that the effects of Prince Ferdinand's admirable di&s;po&s;itions appeared in their full lu&s;tre. The French not having been mole&s;ted by the Briti&s;h cavalry in their retreat, had an opportunity of regain|ing their former advantageous po&s;t. They had, indeed, lo&s;t the honour of the day, and mi&s;&s;ed the &s;troke which they had meditated. They had likewi&s;e lo&s;t a great number of men. But all the&s;e lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces might be repaired, and there &s;eemed nothing deci&s;ive in the day of the Minden. It had certainly happened, as it then appeared, if the Prince who fore&s;eeing this, and neglecting nothing which could be provided, had not formed the plan of detaching away the Hereditary Prince in the manner already related. At five in the morning of that day, this young hero attacked a large body of the French under the Duke de Bri&s;ac; this body, though po&s;ted in a mo&s;t advantageous manner, he entirely defeated, and obliged them to take refuge in Min|den. The news of this blow came with an ill omen to M. de Contades, in the in&s;tant when the Engli&s;h infantry began to engage his centre. The enemy him&s;elf could not help admiring the dexterity of the &s;troke under which he &s;unk: and full of a&s;toni&s;hment at a conduct at once &s;o daring and judicious, paid the ju&s;t applau&s;e to a General, who could detach with &s;ecurity &s;o large a body from his army, when
<PB N="167" REF="203">
he was going to attack an enemy already much &s;uperior to him in numbers.</P>
<P>This happy &s;troke decided the affair, all the pa&s;&s;es thro' which the French could draw &s;uccour or provi&s;ion, were &s;eized. They relinqui&s;hed their &s;trong po&s;t; they fled through Minden, and pa&s;&s;ing the We&s;er, retreated to the ea&s;tward of that river; thus lo&s;ing all the advantages which they had made in the campaign, and forced to retreat thro' a country different from that through which they had ad|vanced, and in which they had taken no mea&s;ures to pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the French in this action amounted to about &s;even thou&s;and men killed, wounded and pri&s;oners; among whom were many officers of con&s;iderable rank. The lo&s;s of the allies was not more than two thou&s;and. The Eng|li&s;h, as they gained the greate&s;t glory, &s;o they were the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. Twelve hundred of the killed and wound|ed were of that nation. The Prince on the day after the battle paid the due honours to the&s;e illu&s;trious corps, as well as to &s;everal of the Hanoverians who had behaved in the &s;ame gallant manner. He did ju&s;tice to the merit of the officers; he di&s;tingui&s;hed their names; and even particula|ri&s;ed &s;o low as captains. To &s;ome in the mo&s;t obliging man|ner he &s;ent con&s;iderable pre&s;ents; and he omitted nothing to &s;hew that he knew what it is to be well &s;erved, and how to encourage the troops and officers to do their duty with &s;pirit and chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Although the Engli&s;h had the greate&s;t &s;hare in the ho|nour of this &s;ignal day, and that the Prince acknowledged their merit in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, ^(^a^)

<PB N="169" REF="205">
<P>The news of a victory &s;o glorious to our troops, and of a cen&s;ure &s;o di&s;graceful to their commander, came at once to England. In proportion to the joy which filled all hearts, in proportion to their opinion of the great general to whom they owed &s;o &s;ea&s;onable an an advantage, was their indignati|on again&s;t the unfortunate commander to whom it was at|tributed that this advantage was not greater. The public, as u&s;ual, judged definitively upon the fir&s;t charge. They never pardon a general who&s;e error it is to fall &s;hort. In vain they are prayed to &s;u&s;pend their judgment, and to wait for a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; the matter is already decided; they have a fact again&s;t an officer, and they look upon all rea|&s;oning in his favour, not &s;o much a defence of his conduct, as the exertion of eloquence and artifice to palliate a neglect
<PB N="170" REF="206">
of duty. This indeed makes the ca&s;e of officers particular|ly hard; but then it always &s;hews them what they have to do.</P>
<P>The merits of the matter are &s;till regarded in the &s;ame light by the public. But the heat, the eagerne&s;s, and cu|rio&s;ity of the fir&s;t movements being over, the matter will be heard, whenever it comes to be again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with le&s;s attention, but with le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion too. It is not for us to de|liver any opinion in &s;o nice a controver&s;y. We have in points of le&s;s moment hitherto declined it; and we &s;hall always de|cline it until the proper judges before whom it probably will come, &s;hall have taught us what to think. There is in|deed no doubt that if the cavalry of the allies right wing, &s;ituated as it was, had been brought to act at the critical time when it had orders to move, the battle of Minden had proved as deci&s;ive as that of Hoc&s;ted. But whether it was a fault in the giving or the delivering of the orders, or whe|ther it was &s;ome mi&s;apprehen&s;ion in him who received them, we cannot but &s;incerely pity a commander of &s;uch admirable talents, who by the error or the misfortune of a moment, lo&s;t an opportunity that would have ranked him for ever with the Marlboroughs and the Brun&s;wicks.</P>
<P>A few days after the battle his lord&s;hip re&s;igned his com|mand and returned to London. He was but a few days in London when he was deprived of all his military employ|ments. The Marquis of Granby, whom the opinion of Prince Ferdinand, and the de&s;ires of the whole army had pointed out, &s;ucceeded him in his command. A generous and ardent courage, an affability of manners that flowed from no artifice, a manly freedom and openne&s;s of &s;oul, a chearful and unre&s;erved conver&s;ation, a munificence that knew no bounds, &s;o many qualities of the man and of the &s;oldier, endeared him to the whole army, and rendered En|gli&s;h and foreigners, his inferiors, his equals and his &s;uperi|or in command, unanimous in his favour.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e changes were making, Prince Ferdinand lo&s;t no time to improve his victory, by the pur&s;uit of the French, who retired in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. The allies were not indeed able to overtake the main body of their army, but they nara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them extreme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and the French were obliged to &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifice a great part of their army piece-meal to pre&s;erve the re&s;t entire. The nece&s;&s;ity of providing &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence drove them towards Ca&s;&s;el. The Prince pur&s;ued

them, obliged them to evacuate that place, and once more freed that poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country from the French tyranny. The ca&s;tle of Ziegenhayn, after an hour's defence, gave the allies about 400 pri&s;oners. After this the He|reditary Prince of Brun&s;wick,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 23."> 

 equally con&s;picu|ous in the greater and the le&s;&s;er operations of war,

 <MILESTONE N="27."> 

 made a private march at night in order to &s;ur|pri&s;e a corps of French irregulars, commanded by the famous partizan Fi&s;cher, which were po&s;ted at Wetter, where it was convenient for the allies to encamp. This corps he entirely routed, killing a great number and taking 400. The French threw a garri&s;on into Marpurg, in hopes of putting &s;ome &s;top to the rapid career of the allies. In effect this did prove an ob&s;tacle for &s;ome days, but at length the ca&s;tle &s;urrendered, and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of between 8 and 900 men,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 11."> 

 became pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>Here a bound was &s;et to the progre&s;s of the allied arms. Not that they were &s;topped by any con&s;iderable ob&s;truction from the main body of the French in that quarter, but from &s;ome effects in another quarter of the un&s;ucce&s;sful begin|ning of the campaign, from which the battle of Minden had not yet perfectly di&s;engaged them. Mun&s;ter was &s;till behind them, and &s;till in the hands of the enemy, who had a powerful garri&s;on in that city. M. de Contades, who even after his defeat exceeded the allies in numbers, and had now no further view of an offen&s;ive campaign, &s;ent a &s;trong body under d'Armentieres, which was reinforced by &s;ome troops from the Lower Rhine, to near 15,000 men, to cover that place. Prince Ferdinand had before detach|ed General Imhoff from Ca&s;&s;el in order to reduce it. On the approach of d'Armentieres, Imhoff was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege. But being &s;oon after reinforced,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 6."> 

 the French commander retired in his turn towards We&s;el, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which place had all along proved of infinite importance to the French in all their ope|rations. The &s;iege of Mun&s;ter was again re&s;umed, but the bu&s;ine&s;s threatened to be difficult and tedious. This however was the only rub which the allies encountered. In all other re&s;pects they were perfectly fortunate. They had driven their enemy two hundred miles before them, and at the end of the campaign, after all their efforts, and all their
<PB N="172" REF="209">
&s;anguine hopes of conque&s;t, &s;et them down ju&s;t where they had begun it.</P>
<P>The event of the battle of Minden, and the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes of the French arms, threw Ver&s;ailles into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Ths news of that defeat arrived ju&s;t as the King was taking hor&s;e to hunt. He retired &s;ilent and dejected into the apartment of Madam de Pompadour, and for &s;ome time &s;aw none of his mini&s;ters. The Duke of Broglio and M. de Contades mutually accu&s;ed each other, for the ill conduct of that day. The public acquitted Bro|glio. Bellei&s;le and his General Contades lo&s;t all reputati|on: but the duke &s;till pre&s;erved his employment and a con|&s;iderable part of his influence at court.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t confu&s;ion and &s;urprize of &s;o unexpect|ed an event was a little abated; it was re&s;olved to &s;end re|inforcements to their army in Germany, and at the &s;ame time to &s;end thither &s;ome officer of experience and authori|ty, who might judge, and compo&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the differ|ences which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the commanders; as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the deliberations for retrieving their affairs. Pub|lic misfortunes call great men from their ob&s;curity. M. de Etrees was cho&s;en on this occa&s;ion, and inve&s;ted with an au|thority which he unwillingly accepted. When he arrived at the French camp,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 25."> 

 he could not avoid a &s;igh on viewing of the ruins of that army, which had triumphed under his command at Ha&s;tenbeck. How|ver, his behaviour to M. de Contades was polite and gene|rous. The old Mare&s;chal told him that he was not come to take his command, but to &s;erve under him; and whil&s;t he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his advice, he would receive his or|ders.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the French endeavour to piece up their broken fortune in Germany, they made &s;ome &s;how of pu&s;hing the other part of their &s;cheme with vigour. All their ports were full of the preparations for an inva&s;ion of the Briti&s;h dominions. Men of war, tra&s;ports and flat-bottomed boats, now almo&s;t a word of ridicule, were prepared with great di|ligence. They talked of a triple embarkation. M. Thu|rot was to command a &s;mall &s;quadron and &s;everal tran&s;ports from Dunkirk, which it was believed were intended for Scotland. This man from a ma&s;ter of a merchant &s;hip be|came a captain of a privateer, in which capacity he greatly annoyed the Engli&s;h trade, and acquired a reputation. At
<PB N="173" REF="210">
a time when France does not abound with great men, his &s;ervices in this way and his daring &s;pirit, recommended him to a command in the King's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign again&s;t England, as the voyage hither is the &s;horte&s;t, was to be attempted from Havre, and &s;ome other ports of Normandy, in flat-bottomed boats. The third embarkation, which was &s;uppo&s;ed again&s;t Ireland, was to be made from Vannes in the Lower Brittany, where a large body of troops was a&s;&s;embled, commanded by the Duke d'Aiguillon governor of that province. This embar|kation was to be covered by the fleet under M. de Conflans, which was preparing with great diligence in Bre&s;t. Had this de&s;ign been &s;uch as it was repre&s;ented, and had it been put into execution, there is no doubt but &s;uch an attempt upon both kingdoms, at three different places at once, mu&s;t have thrown the whole into no &s;mall confu&s;ion. But excel|lent mea&s;ures were taken on the part of England to fru&s;|trate their de&s;igns, whatever they might have been.</P>
<P>A &s;quadron under Commodore Boys was &s;tationed before Dunkirk. Admiral Rodney was &s;ent to bombard Havre, which &s;ervice he performed with &s;ucce&s;s. Admiral Hawke blocked up the harbour of Bre&s;t with a &s;trong &s;quadron, whil&s;t a le&s;&s;er kept a watch upon that of Vannes. The&s;e precautions were continued the whole &s;ummer, during which time the French proceeded rather &s;lowly, but after the battle of Minden had de&s;troyed their hopes in Germany, they turned to this object with the greater attention. What i&s;&s;ue it had we &s;hall relate in its proper place. But their fir&s;t attempts on the ocean proved as un&s;ucce&s;sful as their arms on land.</P>
<P>A great fleet was equipped at Toulon, which &s;ome de&s;ti|ned for America, whil&s;t others believed it was de&s;igned to unite it&s;elf with that of Bre&s;t to favour the inva&s;ion. Ad|miral Bo&s;cawen who commanded in the Mediterranean, blocked up this &s;quadron, until &s;ome unfavourable weather and the foulne&s;s of his &s;hips obliged him to return to Gib|raltar to refit. The French took this opportuni|ty to &s;ail out,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 14."> 

 and they proceeded with great dili|gence to the &s;treights.</P>
<P>They had arrived very near Gibraltar before the admiral had notice of their approach; but notwith&s;tanding that our &s;hips were not perfectly prepared to &s;ail, the admiral u&s;ed
<PB N="174" REF="211">
&s;uch great expedition that in two hours after the account ar|rived the Engli&s;h fleet was out at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h fleet was compo&s;ed of fourteen &s;hips of the line be&s;ides frigates. The enemy had twelve of the line. They were &s;uperior in the bulk of their &s;hips and in the number of men, if they were inferior in the number of ve&s;|&s;els; and it is the opinion of many per&s;ons of judgment&punc; that if they had formed a line of battle, and fought Mr. Bo&s;cawen in order, they might very well have hoped for a better i&s;&s;ue of this matter than they found. But the evil genius of France operating on the cowardice or incapacity of their commander, induced them to &s;eparate their fleet and fly. The Engli&s;h &s;hips were newly refitted; they pro|ved better &s;ailors; and the men, animated with the &s;pirit|ed example of their admiral, engaged the French &s;hips as they could overtake them; and they overtook &s;ome of them off Cape Lagos in Portugal. A bri&s;k engagement en&s;u|ed. Two of the enemy's &s;hips, the Ocean and the Re|doubtable, were run on &s;hore and burned. The fir&s;t was the &s;hip of M. de la Clue, the French admiral, who e&s;ca|ped to land; but being grievou&s;ly wounded, and, as it is &s;aid, having lo&s;t both his legs, he died &s;oon after. Two other capital &s;hips, the Centaure and Mode&s;te, were taken.</P>
<P>The &s;cattered remains of their fleet with difficulty got into the harbour of Cadiz, where they were &s;oon after blocked up, and where they &s;till remain. This action hap|pened on the 18th of Augu&s;t; and it gave a great eclat to the Briti&s;h arms, which, in the &s;ame month, had triumph|ed &s;o &s;ignally both by &s;ea and land ^(^b^).</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Count Dohna di&s;graced. Wedel &s;ucceeds him. The Ru&s;&s;i|ans enter Sile&s;ia. Battle of Zulichau. Ru&s;&s;ians take Frankfort on the Oder. Gen. Laudohn joins them.

Parallel of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and Prince Fer|dinand of Brun&s;wick.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's victory at Ro&s;bach had given the Hanoverians an opportunity to free their coun|try, it might be expected that the affair at Minden would
<PB N="176" REF="213">
have &s;erved to free his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty from &s;ome of the numerous armies that oppre&s;&s;ed him. But as this battle was fought in the middle of the &s;ea&s;on for action, and as Mun&s;ter &s;till continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, Prince Ferdinand could not venture at that time, to make any detachment from his army in the King's favour, with|out ri&s;quing all the advantages which he had obtained from his victory. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was therefore left alone to &s;truggle with the Au&s;trians, Ru&s;&s;ians, Imperiali&s;ts, and Swedes.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, who&s;e motions governed tho&s;e of all the other armies, left their camp at Po&s;na in Poland, and quit|ting the Vi&s;tula, drew near to the banks of the Oder. They
<PB N="177" REF="214">
were under the command of a Ru&s;&s;ian nobleman, Count Soltikoff. Count Dohna, who had been ordered to oppo&s;e them, &s;aw that their numbers were too con&s;iderable, and their po&s;ts too &s;trong to be attacked with any pro&s;pect of advantage, &s;o that he contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving their motions, and hara&s;&s;ing their march. This conduct &s;eemed more dilatory and timid than the circum&s;tances, or the in|clinations of the King could bear. He is &s;aid to have re|proached that General in &s;o &s;evere a manner, for a conduct in which he was in all probability very ju&s;tifiable, that he took the fir&s;t opportunity to re&s;ign his command, and, un|der the pretence of recovering his health, retired to Ber|lin. The King immediately put General Wedel into his place, with po&s;itive orders to engage the Ru&s;&s;ian army at all events. To enable him to obey his commands, he re|inforced him with &s;everal detachments from his own army. The po&s;itivene&s;s of the King's orders on this occa&s;ion may perhaps be cen&s;ured; but it mu&s;t be owned, that the time required a cour&s;e next to de&s;perate. His hereditary domi|nions were in the utmo&s;t danger, and nothing but &s;ome great and fortunate &s;troke could effectually prevent the junction of the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ians armies, an event which, of all others, he had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to dread.</P>
<P>Fortified in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the reinforcements he had received, and in con&s;equence of his orders, Gen. Wedel re&s;olved to attack the Ru&s;&s;ians on their march.

 <MILESTONE N="July 23."> 

 They had got to Zulichau and directed their cour&s;e to Cro&s;&s;en in Sile&s;ia, to get before the Pru&s;|&s;ian army, and to make good the pa&s;&s;age of the Oder. The &s;ituation of the Ru&s;&s;ians was very advantageous; po&s;t|ed upon eminences, defended by a powerful artillery, and near 70,000 &s;trong. The Pru&s;&s;ian army fell &s;hort of 30,000; and they had greater di&s;advantages than their inferiority of number to get over. They had a bridge to pa&s;s, and &s;uch a narrow defile to &s;truggle through, that &s;carce a third of a battalion could march in front. The ground was &s;uch, that the cavalry could not &s;upport their infantry. Yet with all the&s;e difficulties the attack was long and re&s;olute. But this re&s;olution made their repul&s;e, which all the&s;e di&s;|advantages had rendered inevitable, far more bloody and di&s;tre&s;sful. Four thou&s;and &s;even hundred were killed or pri&s;oners: the wounded came to 3000. General Wober|&s;now, an officer of great ability, was killed, and General
<PB N="178" REF="215">
Manteuffel was wounded. The Pru&s;&s;ians were obliged to retire, but they were not pur&s;ued, and they pa&s;&s;ed the Oder without mole&s;tation. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eized upon the towns of Cro&s;&s;en and Frankfort on the Oder.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;ince the beginning of the war, had never hitherto obtained an advantage where he was not per&s;onally pre&s;ent. His pre&s;ence now became more ne|ce&s;&s;ary than ever. Since the action at Zulichau, the Ru&s;&s;i|ans had penetrated a con&s;iderable way into his territories, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important city of Frankfort upon the Oder. He therefore marched with 10,000 of his be&s;t troops, to join the broken army of Wedel, in order to drive this formidable and determined enemy from his country. Prince Henry commanded the remainder of his army, which was too well po&s;ted to fear any in&s;ult during his ab&s;ence. The eyes of all were fixed upon his march, and his &s;oldiers, who remembered Zorndorf, eagerly long|ed to try their &s;trength once more with the &s;ame anta|goni&s;ts.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not unappri&s;ed of the motions of the Ru&s;&s;i|ans, or the de&s;igns of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. He knew that the great fault of the Ru&s;&s;ian troops, was the want of a re|gular and firm cavalry, which might be depended upon in a day of action. This defect was a principal cau&s;e of their misfortune at Zorndorf in the la&s;t year; a misfortune which di&s;concerted all the operations of that campaign. As this was the only want which the Ru&s;&s;ians were under, &s;o it was that which Daun was be&s;t able to &s;upply at a &s;hort warning. With this view he &s;elected about 12,000 of his hor&s;e, and there is no better hor&s;e than that of the Au&s;trians, which with about 8000 foot, he placed under the command of Gen. Laudohn, one of the able&s;t officers in that &s;ervice. This body was divided into two columns, one of which marched through Sile&s;ia, and the other through Lu&s;atia. By extreme good fortune and conduct, with little lo&s;s or oppo&s;ition, they both joined the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and were received with tran&s;ports of joy.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was unable to prevent this &s;troke, joined General Wedel at Muhlro&s;e,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 4."> 

 and took upon him the command of the united armies. But &s;till finding him&s;elf too weak for the deci&s;ive action he was preparing to attempt, he recalled General Finck, whom he had &s;ent &s;ome time
<PB N="179" REF="216">
before into Saxony with nine thou&s;and men, in order to op|po&s;e the Imperiali&s;ts in that country. With the&s;e reinforce|ments he was not able to rai&s;e his army to fifty thou&s;and compleat. That of the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ince the junction of Lau|dohn, was upwards of ninety thou&s;and. They had be&s;ides, taken a po&s;t, which they had &s;o &s;trongly entrenched, and defended with &s;uch a prodigious number of cannon, that it was extremely difficult and hazardous to attempt them, yet under the&s;e accumulated di&s;advantages, it was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould fight. The detachments from Count Daun's army already menaced Berlin; Saxony, which he was obliged to leave expo&s;ed, had become a prey to the Imperiali&s;ts; and the Ru&s;&s;ians united with the Au|&s;trians, encamped before his eyes in Sile&s;ia, the be&s;t and riche&s;t part of his dominions. In &s;hort, his former repu|tation, his pre&s;ent difficulties, his future hopes, every mo|tive of honour and of &s;afety demanded an engagement; the campaign ha&s;ted to a deci&s;ion, and it was evident that no|thing farther could be done by marches and choice of po&s;ts. The &s;anguine temper of other generals has often obliged them to fight under di&s;advantages; but the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's circum&s;tances were &s;uch, that from the multitude of his e|nemies, he was neither able to con&s;ult times nor &s;ituations. Ra&s;hne&s;s could hardly dictate, any thing which in his con|dition, would not have been recommended by prudence.</P>
<P>When the attack was re&s;olved, the King's troops put them&s;elves in motion at two in the morning, and having formed them&s;elves in a wood,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 12."> 

 advanced towards the enemy. It was near eleven, before the action began. The principal effort of the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia was again&s;t the left wing of the Ru&s;&s;ian army. He be|gan according to their u&s;ual method, with a fierce cannon|ade, which having had the effect he de&s;ired from it, he attacked that wing with &s;everal battalions di&s;po&s;ed in co|lumns.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian entrenchments were forced with great &s;laughter. Seventy-two pieces of cannon were taken. But &s;till there was a defile to be pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;everal redoubts to be ma&s;tered, which covered the village of Cunner&s;dorf. The&s;e were attacked with the &s;ame re&s;olution, and taken one after another. The enemy made another &s;tand at the village, and endeavoured to pre&s;erve their ground there, by pu&s;hing forward &s;everal battalions of hor&s;e and foot;
<PB N="180" REF="217">
but their re&s;i&s;tance there, proved not more effectual than it had done every where el&s;e; they were driven from po&s;t to po&s;t, quite to the la&s;t redoubts. For upwards of &s;ix hours Fortune favoured the Pru&s;&s;ians, who every where broke the enemy, with an unparallelled &s;laughter. They had driven them from almo&s;t all the ground which they had occupied before the battle, they had taken more than half their artillery; &s;carce any thing &s;eemed wanting to the mo&s;t complete deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King in tho&s;e circum&s;tances wrote a billet to the Queen to this effect;
<Q>Madam, we have beat the Ru&s;&s;i|ans from their entrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.</Q>
This news arrived at Ber|lin, ju&s;t as the po&s;t was going out, and the friends of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia throughout Europe, exulted in a certain conclu&s;ive victory. Mean time, Fortune was preparing for him a terrible rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemy, defeated in almo&s;t every quarter, found their left wing, &s;hattered as it was, to be more entire than any other part of the army. Count Soltikoff therefore a&s;|&s;embled the remains of his right, and gathering as many as he could from the centre, reinforced that wing, and made a &s;tand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advan|tageous eminence, in a place called <HI>The Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> burying ground.</HI> Nothing was wanting to fini&s;h matters in favour of the King, but to drive the Ru&s;&s;ians from this their la&s;t hope. But this enterprize was difficult. It is confidently &s;aid, that the Pru&s;&s;ian generals were unanimous in opinion, that they &s;hould not endeavour at that time to pu&s;h any fur|ther the advantages they had obtained. They repre&s;ented to the King, that the enemy was &s;till very numerous, their artillery con&s;iderable, and the po&s;t which they occupied of great &s;trength; that his brave troops, who had been en|gaged for &s;o long a time, in the &s;evere&s;t action, perhaps, ever known, and in one of the hotte&s;t days ever felt, were too much exhau&s;ted for a new attempt; an attempt of &s;uch extreme difficulty, as might daunt even troops that were quite fre&s;h. That the advantage he gained would be as de|ci&s;ive in its con&s;equences as that at Zorndorf; and whil&s;t the enemy filled the gazettes of their party, with frivolous di&s;putes of the field of battle, he would be reaping, as he did then, all the effects of an unque&s;tioned victory. That the enemy would be obliged to retire immediately into Po|land,
<PB N="181" REF="218">
and to leave him at liberty to act in other quarters, where his pre&s;ence was full as nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons were very cogent; and for a few moments they &s;eemed to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome weight with the King. But his character &s;oon determined him to a contrary re&s;olution. He could not bear to be a conqueror by halves. One effort more was alone wanting to that victory, which would free him for ever from the adver&s;ary, which had leaned heavie&s;t on him during the whole war.</P>
<P>Once more he put all to the hazard. His infantry, &s;till re&s;olute, and &s;upported by their late &s;ucce&s;s, were readily brought to act again. They drew on their bodies fainting with heat and labour to a new attack. But the enterprize was beyond their &s;trength. The &s;ituation of the enemy was impregnable; and their artillery, which began to be &s;upe|rior to that of the Pru&s;&s;ians, on account of the difficulty of the ground, which made it impo&s;&s;ible for the latter to bring up any other than a few &s;mall pieces, repul&s;ed the&s;e feeble battalions with a great &s;laughter. With an a&s;toni&s;hing, per|haps, with a blameable per&s;everance, the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry was brought to a &s;econd attack, and were a &s;econd time repul&s;ed, and with a lo&s;s greater than at fir&s;t. The&s;e ef|forts being un&s;ucce&s;sful, the affair was put to the cavalry. They made redoubled but u&s;ele&s;s attacks; the hor&s;es were &s;pent, as well as tho&s;e they carried.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t at that time, when the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e was wa&s;ted by the&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts, that the greate&s;t part of the Ru&s;&s;ian, and the whole body of the Au&s;trian cavalry, which had been hitherto quite inactive, and which was therefore quite fre&s;h, ru&s;hed down upon them, broke them to pieces, forced them back upon their foot, and threw the whole into irreparable di&s;order. The whole army was &s;eiz|ed with a panic; and in a few minutes tho&s;e troops, &s;o lately victorious and irre&s;i&s;table, were totally di&s;per&s;ed and defeated. The King did every thing to re&s;tore the field, hazarding his per&s;on, even beyond his former daring, and prodigal of a life, which he &s;eemed to think, ought not to be &s;eparated from conque&s;t. Thrice he led on his troops to the charge; two hor&s;es were killed under him; &s;everal balls were in his cloaths. The efforts of &s;kill, courage, and de&s;pair, were made, and proved ineffectual; a &s;ingle error outweighed them all. Scarcely a general, hardly an inferior officer in the army was without &s;ome wound. That of Ge|neral
<PB N="182" REF="219">
Seidlitz was particularly unfortunate; for to that wound, the failure of the hor&s;e which he commanded, was principally attributed. It was to the &s;pirit and conduct of this able officer, that a great part of the &s;ucce&s;s at Zorndorf was owing, and the la&s;t campaign. It is known, that if it had not been for a &s;ea&s;onable movement of the hor&s;e, the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army had then been in great danger of a defeat.</P>
<P>The night, and the prudent u&s;e of &s;ome eminences, which were defended as well as circum&s;tances would admit, pre&s;erved the Pru&s;&s;ian army from total de&s;truction. How|ever, this lo&s;s was far greater than any which they had &s;u&s;|tained from the beginning of the war. All their cannon was taken, the killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, by the mo&s;t favourable accounts, were near twenty thou&s;ands. Gene|ral Putkammer was killed on the &s;pot. The&s;e generals who&s;e names are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in this war, Itzenplitz, Hul&s;en, Finck, Wedel, and Seidlitz, were among the wounded; as was the Prince of Wurtenburg, and five ma|jor generals. The enemy could not have fewer than ten thou&s;and killed on their &s;ide. For hardly ever was a more bloody battle.</P>
<P>When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia found him&s;elf obliged to quit the field, he &s;ent another di&s;patch to the Queen, expre&s;&s;ed in this manner,
<Q>Remove from Berlin with the royal fa|mily. Let the archives be carried to Potzdam. The town may make conditions with the enemy.</Q>
We &s;hould in vain attempt to draw the picture of the court and city, on the receipt of &s;uch news in the mid&s;t of the joy, which they indulged for that which they had received but a few hours before. The terror was increa&s;ed by the indi|&s;tinct relation that &s;oon followed, which gave them only to under&s;tand, that their army was totally routed; that there was no account of the King, and that a Ru&s;&s;ian army was advancing to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their city.</P>
<P>The day after the battle, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia repa&s;&s;ed the Oder, and encamped at Retwein. From thence he moved to Fu&s;tenwalde, and placed him&s;elf in &s;uch a man|ner, that the Ru&s;&s;ians did not venture to make any attempt upon Berlin. He continually watched their army; a part of which, in&s;tead of turning towards Brandenburgh, march|ed into Lu&s;atia, where it joined that of the Au&s;trians. Here the victorious General Soltikoff, for the fir&s;t time, met M.
<PB N="183" REF="220">
Daun, and amid&s;t rejoicings and congratulations, con&s;ulted about the mea&s;ures for improving their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies thus united, &s;carce &s;eemed from their &s;trength and their victories, to have any other deliberation left, than of what part of the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions they &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The King was twice defeated with a va&s;t lo&s;s. He was cut off from all commu|nication with the army of his brother Prince Henry; yet to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the world, the &s;uperior, the vic|torious and united army acted upon the defen&s;ive, and were curbed in all their motions, and fru&s;trated in all their de|&s;igns, by the inferior, the beated and divided. Nothing ever &s;hewed the genius of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia more fully, than his conduct after the battle of Cunner&s;dorf. In a few days after &s;o terrible a defeat, every thing was in order in his camp. He &s;upplied the lo&s;s of his artillery from his &s;tores in Berlin. He recalled General Klei&s;t, with about five thou&s;and men from Pomerania; in pre&s;ence of two &s;uch armies as tho&s;e, of M. Daun and Count Soltikoff, he de|tached &s;ix thou&s;and men from his &s;mall body, to the relief of Saxony, where the army of the Empire had availed it&s;elf of his ab&s;ence, to reduce the whole country. Hall, Wit|temberg, Leip&s;ic, Torgau, and at la&s;t Dre&s;den it&s;elf, had opened their gates to the Imperiali&s;ts. With the remain|der of his troops, he put him&s;elf between the Ru&s;&s;ians and Great Glogau, covered that city, which was the object of the enemy's de&s;igns, and &s;aw them &s;oon after, notwith|&s;tanding their two victories, obliged to return again into Poland; and to leave him free for the re&s;t of the campaign.</P>
<P>What was done by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ince that time, will be the &s;ubject of another chapter; after we have re|lated the proceedings of the Engli&s;h and French in America, to which the order of time directs our pre&s;ent attention. But we cannot di&s;mi&s;s the affairs of Germany, in which two &s;uch battles as tho&s;e of Minden and Cunner&s;dorf were fought, with events &s;o different for the common cau&s;e, without ob&s;erving &s;omething concerning the two generals who conducted them.</P>
<P>They are certainly in reputation the fir&s;t in Europe, which probably never produced two greater men; though they differ as much in their characters, and in the kind of talents they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as they agree in the greatne&s;s of their abilities for war. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, rapid, vehement,
<PB N="184" REF="221">
impatient, often gives deci&s;ive blows; but he often mi&s;&s;es his &s;troke, and wounds him&s;elf. Prince Ferdinand is cool, deliberate, exact, and guarded; he &s;ees every po&s;&s;ible ad|vantage, he takes it at the moment, pur&s;ues it as far as it will go; but never attempts to pu&s;h it farther. Nothing in the man di&s;turbs the commander. In him, we do not &s;ee a per&s;on who is a great &s;oldier; it is the idea of a per|fect General; it is a general in the ab&s;tract. Ferdinand &s;uffers his temper to be guided by his bu&s;ine&s;s. He never precipitates matters; he takes them in their order and their cour&s;e, and tru&s;ts nothing to fortune. The King on the other hand, leads, and even forces circum&s;tances; he does not endeavour to remove but to over-leap ob&s;tacles; he puts all to the ri&s;que; and by &s;uffering Fortune to play her part in his de&s;igns, he acquires a &s;plendor and eclat in his actions, which mere wi&s;dom could never give him. Prince Ferdinand is famous for never committing a fault. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia is above all the world, in repairing tho&s;e he has committed. Like &s;ome of the great ma&s;ters in writing, when ever he makes, or &s;eems to make a mi&s;|take, it is a &s;ignal to the ob&s;erver, to prepare for &s;ome great and admirable &s;troke of &s;pirit and conduct. His er|rors &s;eem to be &s;purs to his abilities. He commits an er|ror, he repairs it; he errs again; and again a&s;toni&s;hes us by his manner of e&s;caping. We &s;hould often condemn the commander, but that we are always forced to admire the hero.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Plan of the campaign in North America. Three expeditions. Ticonderoga and Crown Point abandoned. Colonel Town|&s;hend killed. Expedition to Niagara. Colonel Prideaux killed. Sir William John&s;on defeats the French. Takes Fort Niagara. Con&s;equences of this.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE theatre of our operations in America, is of &s;uch a va&s;t extent, that if we had per&s;evered in the cour&s;e we pur&s;ued for &s;ome time, in attacking but one place at once, the war would inevitably be &s;pun out to an extreme length, without bringing on any thing deci&s;ive; and it would have rendered our natural &s;uperiority of little u&s;e, by &s;uffering the French to collect, as they had hitherto
<PB N="185" REF="222">
done, their &s;trength into one &s;ingle point, which enabled them to contend with us, with a force &s;ufficient for the &s;ervice in that country. This year another method was followed. It was propo&s;ed to attack the French in all their &s;trong po&s;ts at once; to fall as nearly as po&s;&s;ible at the &s;ame time upon Crown Points, Niagara, and the forts to the &s;outh of Lake Erie, whil&s;t a great naval ar|mament, and a con&s;iderable body of land forces &s;hould attempt Quebec, by the River St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>This plan was very advi&s;able, as it tended to weaken, by di&s;tracting the re&s;i&s;tance of the enemy, and whil&s;t we adhered to it, it was clearly impo&s;&s;ible for the French to maintain their ground in any of tho&s;e places which were attacked, without very weakly defending, or even de&s;ert|ing &s;ome of the others; and if, by the means of &s;uch diver&s;ions, any of tho&s;e places &s;hould fall into our hands, the campaign could not be &s;aid to be &s;pent to no purpo&s;e. But be&s;ides the end in di&s;tracting the enemy's defence, there was another propo&s;ed of no le&s;s con&s;equence; which was to make a concurrence in all the various operations, &s;o that whil&s;t they divided the enemy, they might mutually &s;upport one another.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t, who commanded the American forces in chief, with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable body, amounting, in regulars and provincials, to about twelve thou&s;and men, was to attack Ticonderoga and Crown Point by Lake-George; the reduction of tho&s;e forts would naturally lay open the Lake Champlain, where, having e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ufficient naval force, he was by the River Sorel, which forms the communication between this Lake and the great River St. Lawrence, to proceed directly to Quebec, the capital of Canada. Here he was to make a junction with General Wolfe and Admiral Saunders, who having entered the River St. Lawrence at the oppo&s;ite quarter, would pro|bably have commenced the &s;iege of Quebec, by the time that General Amher&s;t might find it practicable to join them. It was not doubted, that if this junction could be effected, the reduction of that city would follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The third of the grand operations was again&s;t the fort, near the Fall of Niagara; a place of very great con&s;equence both in war and in peace. The reduction of this was com|mitted to Brigadier General Prideaux, under whom Sir William John&s;on commanded the provincials of New York,
<PB N="186" REF="223">
and &s;everal Indians of the Five Nations, who were engaged in our &s;ervice by the credit that gentleman had obtained a|mong their tribes.</P>
<P>The object of this operation lay too remote from the o|thers, to expect, with any great confidence, that they could be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by its &s;ucce&s;s in any other manner than by weakening the enemy's forces. However it was hoped, that if they &s;hould be fortunate enough to take Niagara, early in the &s;ea&s;on, the troops might be embarked on the Lake Ontario, and finding no longer any ob&s;truction from Fort Frontenac, which was de&s;troyed la&s;t year, might fall down the River St. Lawrence, and po&s;&s;ibly either make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Montreal, or by their approach at lea&s;t, draw &s;uch a force to that part, as greatly to faci|litate our de&s;igns upon Quebec and Crown Point. But if this &s;cheme, in addition to its own end, &s;hould not facili|tate either of the other two capital undertakings, it would probably, as it was the mo&s;t important place the French had in that part of the world, draw all the troops they had upon the Lakes to attempt its relief, which would leave the fort, on tho&s;e Lakes expo&s;ed to a fourth, though infe|rior expedition, which was made again&s;t them, under Ge|neral Stanwix. In reality, it afterwards had that effect.</P>
<P>The army under General Amher&s;t was the fir&s;t in mo|tion. The Lake George, or, as the French call it, Lake Sacrament, is a long, but in proportion, narrow water, a|bout forty miles in length, and enclo&s;ed on either &s;ide with mar&s;hy grounds. This communicates by another long and very narrow &s;treight with Lake Champlain. This &s;treight is &s;ecured at each &s;ide by a fort; that to the &s;ide of Lake George, is called Ticonderoga; that to the Champlain Lake, is called Fort Frederick, or Crown Point; both extremely &s;trong in their &s;ituation; and the former of which had repul&s;ed our troops with a very con&s;iderable &s;laughter, as has been related among&s;t the events of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t, after he had pa&s;&s;ed Lake George, ar|rived with very little oppo&s;ition from the enemy before Ti|conderoga; at fir&s;t the French made &s;ome appearance, as if they meant to defend the place; but as they knew the &s;trength of our forces, as they &s;aw that the preparations for the attack were making with as much judgment as vi|gour, and as the enterprize which was preparing again&s;t Quebec, did not leave them a force &s;o con&s;iderable as they
<PB N="187" REF="224">
had there in the preceding campaign, they abandoned their fort in the night,

 <MILESTONE N="July"> 

 having damaged it as much as they could, and retired to Crown Point</P>
<P>General Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t immediately &s;et him&s;elf about repair|ing the fortifications of this po&s;t, which effectually &s;ecured the Lake George; covered our colonies, and was of &s;uch va&s;t importance, to enable him to pu&s;h forward his offen|&s;ive operations, or to favour his retreat, in ca&s;e of a re|ver&s;e of fortune. The only lo&s;s of any con&s;equence which the Engli&s;h army &s;uffered, in making this valuable acqui&s;i|tion, was the death of Colonel Town&s;end, who was killed in reconnoitring, by a &s;hot from the fort. The &s;teady bravery, the promi&s;ing genius, and the agreeable manners of this officer, cau&s;ed this lo&s;s to be con&s;idered as a very great one. They compared this melancholy event with the death of Lord Howe; they remembered how much the&s;e young &s;oldiers re&s;embled each other, both in their virtues, and in the circum&s;tances of their fate. Both dear to the troops, and having both lo&s;t their lives on an expe|dition again&s;t this place.</P>
<P>Although the general had rea&s;on to imagine, that the &s;ame rea&s;ons which had induced the enemy to abandon their fort and lines at Ticonderoga, would per&s;uade them al&s;o to relinqui&s;h Crown Point; he took all his mea&s;ures with the &s;ame care, as if he expected an ob&s;tinate defence at the fort, and an attempt to &s;urprize him on his march. He remembered how fatal &s;ecurity had proved to us, in that part of the world upon many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The French abandoned the fort as it had been fore&s;een. The general retired with about three thou&s;and five hundred men to the bottom of Lake Champlain, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the i&s;land called I&s;le du Noix. He was &s;till pretty &s;trong on the lake, having &s;everal armed boats and &s;loops, with which he hoped to prevent the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h into the interior parts of Canada. General Amher&s;t, as &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown Point, u&s;ed every endeavour to attain a naval &s;uperiority on the lake,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 14."> 

 and in the mean time began to fortify this po&s;t, as he had that at Ticonderoga. To this time the French were actu|ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heart of our territories; &s;o that dur|ing a war of three years, we had in effect been only acting on the defen&s;ive. It was on the day on which Mr. Am|her&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown Point, that he received the
<PB N="188" REF="225">
agreeable news of the reduction of Niagara, by the troops under Sir William John&s;on; and he had the plea&s;ure and encouragement of &s;eeing two of the great objects of the campaign accompli&s;hed, whil&s;t he prepared him&s;elf to co-operate in the accompli&s;hment of the third, which was to be deci&s;ive of the whole. The body which had been appointed for Niagara, under General Prideaux, without any accident arrived at the fort, which lies at the bottom of the lake, towards the &s;outh-we&s;t ^(^a^).</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the honour to acquiant you, by lieutenant <HI>Monterieff, Ni|agara</HI> &s;urrendered to his maje&s;ty's arms the 25th in&s;tant. A detachment of 1200 men, with a number of <HI>Indians,</HI> under the command of Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Aubry</HI> and <HI>de Lignery,</HI> collected from <HI>Detroi, Venango,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;que I&s;le,</HI> made an attempt to reinforce the gar|ri&s;on, the 24th in the morning; but as I had intelligence of them&punc; I made a di&s;po&s;ition to intercept them. The evening before, I ordered the light infantry and picquets to take po&s;t on the road upon our left, leading from <HI>Niagara Falls</HI> to the fort: In the morning, I reinforced the&s;e with two companies of grenadiers, and part of the 46th regiment. The action began about half an hour after nine; but they were &s;o well received by the troops in front, and the <HI>Indians</HI> on their flank, that, in an hour's time, the whole was compleatly ruined, and all their officers made pri&s;o|ners, among whom are Mon&s;. <HI>Aubry, De Lignery, Marin, Re|pentini,</HI> &amp;c. to the number of 17. I cannot a&s;certain the num|ber of killed, they are &s;o di&s;per&s;ed among the woods, but their lo&s;s is great.</P>
<P>As this happened under the eyes of the garri&s;on, I thought proper to &s;end my la&s;t &s;ummons to the commanding officer for his &s;urrendering, which he li&s;tened to. M. <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rieff</HI> will inform you of the &s;tate of our ammunition and provi&s;ions: I hope care will be taken to forward an immediate &s;upply of both to <HI>O&s;wego.</HI> As the troops that were defeated ye&s;terday were drawn from tho&s;e po&s;ts, which lie in General <HI>Stanwix</HI>'s route, I am in hopes it will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition.

</LETTER>

<P>This is without exception, the mo&s;t important po&s;t in America, and &s;ecures the greate&s;t number of communica|tions. For it is &s;ituated at the very entrance of a &s;treight, by which the Lake Ontario is joined to that of Erie, which is connected with the other three great &s;eas of fre&s;h water, by the cour&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> St. Lawrence, which runs through them all, and carries off their &s;uperfluous waters to the ocean. A little above the fort, is the cataract of Niagara, which is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t remarkable in the world, for the quantity of water, and the greatne&s;s of the fall. This fall would interrupt the commerce between the lakes, but for a road which the French have made up the hilly country that lies up the &s;treight; &s;o that there is here a good carrying-place, and not very tedious; for after a portage of about eight miles, you reimbark again, and pro|ceed without any interruption to the Lake Erie.</P>
<P>As the great communication of tho&s;e who go by water is along this &s;treight, and carrying place, &s;o tho&s;e who tra|vel by land, are obliged to cro&s;s it. The lakes are &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed, that without a &s;omewhat hazardous voyage, the In|dians cannot any otherwi&s;e pa&s;s from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of North-America, for many hundred miles. The fort of Niagara, thus naturally commands all the Five Nations, and all tho&s;e Indian tribes that lie to the north|ward of the lakes, as well as tho&s;e that are &s;cattered along the banks of the Ohio, Ouabache, and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and ac|cording as it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h or the French, connects or disjoints the colonies of Canada and Lou&s;iana, protects or lays open our own, and is in all re&s;pects of &s;o much con&s;equence, that it was the opinion of per&s;ons, the mo&s;t conver&s;ant in American bu&s;ine&s;s, that this attempt ought to have been made much earlier; and, that if &s;uch an attempt, made at &s;uch a time, had &s;ucceeded, it would have contributed very much to the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e parts
<PB N="190" REF="227">
of our colonies, which were the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, and would have, at the &s;ame time, greatly facilitated all our offen&s;ive mea&s;ures, and &s;hortened the war.</P>
<P>From the time that the French were acquainted with this place, they were fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of its importance, both with regard to commerce, and to domi|nion. They made &s;everal attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves here; but the Indians who &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible of the con|&s;equences than we were, con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed it. They guarded this &s;pot for a long time, with a very &s;evere and prudent jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t we neglected, confiding in our &s;trength, to cul|tivate the friend&s;hip of the Indians, the French, &s;en&s;ible of their weakne&s;s, omitted no endeavour to gain the&s;e &s;avage people to their intere&s;ts, and they prevailed at la&s;t, under the name of a trading hou&s;e, to erect a &s;trong fort at the mouth of the &s;treight, on the very be&s;t harbour, not only on this, but on any of the lakes; an harbour which is &s;afe from e|very wind, and open for the whole year. A French officer, an able and enterpri&s;ing man, had been a pri&s;oner among the Iroquois for a long time, and having, according to their cu&s;tom, been naturalized, he grew extremely popular a|mong&s;t them, and at la&s;t acquired his liberty. He com|municated to the then Governor of Canada, the plan of an e&s;tabli&s;hment at Niagara, and he him&s;elf undertook to exe|cute it. He returned among&s;t the Iroquois, and pretending great love for their nation, which was now his own, told them, that he would gladly come to make frequent vi&s;its to his brethren; but it was proper for that purpo&s;e, that they &s;hould allow him to build an hou&s;e, where he might live at ea&s;e, and according to his own manner: at the &s;ame time, he propo&s;ed to them, advantages in trade from this e&s;tabli&s;hment. A reque&s;t, which &s;eemed a compliment to tho&s;e to whom it was made, was readily granted. The hou&s;e was built. By degrees this hou&s;e extended it&s;elf; it was &s;trengthened by various additions; and it grew at la&s;t to a regular fortre&s;s, which has ever &s;ince awed the Five Nations, and checked our colonies.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of this place had not been long formed, before General Prideaux was killed in the trenches, by the bur&s;ting of a cohorn.

an expre&s;s was &s;ent to General Amber&s;t, who al|ways attentive to the &s;ervice, lo&s;t no time to &s;end an offi|cer of character to command in his place. But the com|mand, which in the interim devolved upon Sir William John&s;on, could not have been better be&s;towed. He omit|ted nothing to continue the vigorous mea&s;ures of the late General, and added to them, every thing his own genius could &s;ugge&s;t. Re&s;pected by the regular troops, dear to the provincials, almo&s;t adored by the Indians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that genius for acquiring popularity among&s;t all kinds of men, and that ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition, which we &s;o &s;eldom &s;ee united with di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and integrity, he employed tho&s;e talents &s;olely for the benefit of his country. The troops, remembering, that it was under that General, the fir&s;t advantage had been obtained over the French, pu&s;hed on the &s;iege with &s;o much alacrity, that in a few days they had brought their approaches within an hundred yards of the covered way</P>
<P>The French were alarmed at the imminent danger of this intere&s;ting place. They therefore collected all the regular troops and provincials, which they could draw from all their po&s;ts about the lakes, and to tho&s;e joined a large body of &s;avages, in order to give the Engli&s;h battle, and to rai&s;e the &s;iege. The amounted in all to 1700 men.</P>
<P>When General John&s;on was apprized of their approach, he ordered his light infantry, &s;upported by &s;ome grenadiers and regular foot, to take po&s;t on the road to his left, by which the French were to take their route. He placed his Indians on his flanks. Whil&s;t he took mea&s;ures to receive the French, who came to relieve the place, he po&s;ted a &s;trong body, in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ecure his trenches from any attempt of the garri&s;on during an engagement.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition he waited to receive the ene|my.

 At nine in the morning the engagement be|gan, by a violent and horrid &s;cream of the enemy's &s;avages, according to their barbarous cu&s;tom. It was this &s;cream, perhaps the mo&s;t horrid &s;ound that can be imagined, which is &s;aid to have &s;truck a panic into the troops of General Braddock, and was one of the principal cau&s;es of that de|feat, by which our endeavours in America were &s;o long fru&s;trated; but on this occa&s;ion it had no effect. The e|nemy was &s;o well received by the troops in front, and by the Indians on their flanks, that in le&s;s than an hour's time,

their whole army was ruined. The pur&s;uit was hot and bloody; and it continued for five miles. Seventeen offi|cers were made pri&s;oners, among whom were the fir&s;t and &s;econd in command.</P>

 <MILESTONE N="July 25."> 

 This action was fought in &s;ight of the fort; and it was no &s;ooner concluded it favour of our troops, than the General &s;ummoned the garri&s;on to &s;ur|render; &s;ending a li&s;t of the pri&s;oners, and remon&s;trating on the ill effects of their holding out longer, particularly with regard to the Indians. The capitulation was &s;igned that night. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of about 600 men, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war, and were conducted to New York. The fort and &s;tores were given up to the Engli&s;h troops.</P>
<P>This was the &s;econd very important &s;ervice performed by General John&s;on in this war, and a &s;econd time he had the good fortune to make the commander in chief of the enemy his pri&s;oner. It mu&s;t not be omitted, to the ho|nour of this gentleman, that though he was not regularly bred a &s;oldier, the mo&s;t compleat officer could not have made more excellent di&s;po&s;itions for the battle, or have conducted the &s;iege from the beginning to the end, with a more cool and &s;teady re&s;olution, or with a more compleat knowledge of all the nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres of war. The taking of Niagara broke off effectually that communication, &s;o much talked off, and &s;o much dreaded, between Ca|nada and Loui&s;iana, and by this &s;troke, one of the capi|tal political de&s;igns of the French, which gave occa&s;ion to the pre&s;ent war, was defeated in its direct and im|mediate object.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE con&s;equences which attended the reduction of the fort of Niagara, as well as tho&s;e upon Lake Cham|plain, were very intere&s;ting; but the great and central operation to which all the re&s;t tended, and to which even tho&s;e were to be only &s;ub&s;ervient, was that again&s;t Que|bec, the capital of Canada; and as this was to be the de|ci&s;ive &s;troke, it was proper that the greate&s;t force &s;hould have been employed again&s;t it. If we reckon the maritime force, there is no doubt that we employed a greater num|ber of men again&s;t Quebec, than again&s;t the Champlain forts; but the land forces, from &s;ome cau&s;e, fell much &s;hort of the number originally propo&s;ed, for they did not exceed 7000 men, regulars and provincials, though the original plan intended 9000 for that expedition, indepen|dent of the junction of tho&s;e under Gen. Amher&s;t, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the occa&s;ion was taken for granted. In this expedition Gen. Wolfe commanded the land forces. The fleet was under Admiral Saunders.</P>

 <MILESTONE N="26th."> 

The whole embarkation arrived in the latter end of June in the I&s;le of Orleans, a few leagues from Quebec, without any accident what&s;oever, notwith&s;tanding the ill fame of the river St. Laurence, and the reports of its dangerous navigation, probably &s;pread for political purpo&s;es. They landed upon the I&s;le of Or|leans, which is formed by the branches of the river St. Laurence. This i&s;land is about twenty miles in length, and &s;even or eight in breadth, highly cultivated, and af|fording every kind of refre&s;hment to the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors after their tedious voyage.</P>
<P>As this i&s;land extends quite up to the ba&s;on of Quebec, it was nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in order to act again&s;t the
<PB N="194" REF="231">
town; for the mo&s;t we&s;terly point of this i&s;land advances towards an high point of land on the continent, called Point Levi. Both of the&s;e &s;hut up the view of the northern and &s;outhern channel, which environ the i&s;le of Orleans, &s;o that the harbour of Quebec appears to be a ba&s;on landlock|ed upon all &s;ides. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both the&s;e points were nece&s;&s;ary, as they might be employed either with great ad|vantage again&s;t the town, or much to the annoyance of the be&s;iegers; for whil&s;t the enemy continued ma&s;ters of tho&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;hip to lie in the harbour of Quebec. When the&s;e po&s;ts were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which was done with little difficulty, the harbour and town of Quebec appeared full to the view, at on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a tempting and di&s;couraging &s;ight. For no place &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater benefits of nature; nor any of which nature &s;eems more to have con|&s;ulted the defence.</P>
<P>Quebec, &s;ays F. Charlevoix, can boa&s;t of a fre&s;h water harbour, capable of containing an hundred men of war of the line, at one hundred and twenty leagues di&s;tance from the &s;ea. It lies on the mo&s;t navigable river in the univer&s;e. The river St. Laurence up to the i&s;le of Orleans, that is for about 112 leagues from its mouth, is no where le&s;s than from four to five leagues broad; but above that i&s;le it nar|rows, &s;o that before Quebec it is not above a mile over. Hence this place got the name of Quebeis or Quebec, which, in the Algonquin tongue, &s;ignifies a &s;trait.</P>
<P>The city is the &s;eat of the governor and the intend|ant, and the &s;upreme tribunals of ju&s;tice for all the French North America; it is al&s;o an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and a place of con&s;iderable trade. It is large in extent, and elegant in many of its buildings both public and private. It con&s;i&s;ts of an upper and lower town; the lower, which is narrow, is built upon a &s;trand, at the foot of a lofty rock, upon which the upper town &s;tands. This rock extends it&s;elf, and continues with a bold and &s;teep front, we&s;tward along the river St. Laurence for a con&s;iderable way. Another river from the north-we&s;t, called St. Charles, falls here in|to the former, wa&s;hing the foot of the rock on which Que|bec &s;tands; the point on which the town is built, thus be|comes a &s;ort of penin&s;ula by the junction of the&s;e rivers; &s;o that whoever attacks Quebec, mu&s;t either make his ap|proaches above the town, and overcome the precipice which I have mentioned, or cro&s;s the river St. Charles, and at|tempt
<PB N="195" REF="232">
it upon that &s;ide. The former of tho&s;e methods mu&s;t appear to a prudent commander wholly unadvi&s;eable, and the latter extremely difficult. If the former method &s;hould be attempted, they would have that dangerous precipice to overcome, defended by the enemies whole force, which the attack would draw to this quarter. On the other hand the country from the river St. Charles to the northward, for more than five miles, is extremely rough, broken and difficult, full of rivulets, gullies, and ravines, and &s;o con|tinues to the river of Montmorenci, which flows by the foot of a &s;teep and woody hill. On the &s;ide of the river St. Laurence is a bank of &s;and of great extent, which pre|vents the approach of any con&s;iderable ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>In this advantageous &s;ituation was the French army po&s;t|ed, upon what was deemed the only acce&s;&s;ible &s;ide of Que|bec, all along from the river St. Charles to that of Mont|morenci, entrenched at every attackable &s;pot, with the ri|ver and &s;andbank abovementioned in their front, and thick impenetrable woods upon their rear. It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine a &s;tronger po&s;t; a po&s;t at once more defen&s;ible in it&s;elf, or better calculated for &s;uccouring a city, on which &s;ide &s;oever it &s;hould be attacked. Thus po&s;ted, they great|ly exceeded in number the be&s;iegers, being about 10,000 men, under an able, and thitherto fortunate commander, M. de Montcalm, who, though he was &s;uperior in number to the Engli&s;h, re&s;olved to ri&s;que nothing, and wi&s;ely relied on the natural &s;trength of the country.</P>
<P>When Wolfe &s;aw the &s;ituation of the town, the nature of the country, the number of the troops, and their po&s;iti|on, though of a &s;anguine temper and highly adventurous, he began to de&s;pair; but, however another commander might have thought inaction in &s;uch circum&s;tances ju&s;tified to him&s;elf, or even to the world, by &s;uch &s;trong appearan|ces, Wolfe re&s;olved to leave nothing unattempted, but amid&s;t the choice of difficulties which lay before him, to pitch upon tho&s;e where the valour of his troops might be employed with the be&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had &s;ecured the we&s;t point of the i&s;le of Orleans, and that of Levi, he erected batteries there of cannon and mortars, on the high ground, from the point of Levi, which looks towards the town; the&s;e fired conti|nually upon the place; Admiral Saunders was &s;tationed be|low in the north channel of the i&s;le of Orleans, oppo&s;ite to
<PB N="196" REF="233">
Montmorenci; Admiral Holmes was &s;tationed above the town, at once to di&s;tract the enemies attention, and to pre|vent any attempts from the enemy again&s;t the batteries that played upon the town.</P>
<P>After this wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was made of the fleet, Gen. Wolfe cau&s;ed the troops to be tran&s;ported over the north channel of the river St. Laurence, to the north-ea&s;t of Mont|morenci, with a view of pa&s;&s;ing that river, and bringing the enemy to an engagement. Some heights which com|manded the enemies intrenchments, and a ford above, and another below the falls, encouraged him to this attempt; but upon reconnoitring the ground, the oppo&s;ite &s;hore was found &s;o &s;teep and woody, that he could not hope to put his de&s;ign in execution, which was by moving towards the ene|mies flank, to draw them to an engagement. To bring the French to an action was his &s;ingle object. He had found that any attempts to a&s;&s;ault the city would prove to no purpo&s;e, whil&s;t the fleet could only batter the lower town, and mu&s;t &s;uffer greatly by the cannon and bombs of the upper, whil&s;t they were employed in this ineffectual &s;ervice; for after the reduction of the lower town, the pa&s;|&s;ages to the upper were extremely &s;teep, and moreover &s;o well entrenched, that this advantage would prove little to|wards the reduction of the place.</P>
<P>The only point left, therefore, was by every means to entice or force the enemy to an engagement; and to this end no means were omitted, by &s;ending detachments up the river, and by every appearance of a de&s;ign to attack the town on that &s;ide. But the Marquis de Montcalm, in chu&s;ing his po&s;t, was well appri&s;ed of its importance. He knew &s;ufficiently the nature of the country up the river, and he tru&s;ted to it; and therefore kept him&s;elf clo&s;ely in his po&s;t, di&s;po&s;ing his parties of &s;avages, in which he was very &s;trong, in &s;uch a manner, as to make any attempt upon him by &s;urpri&s;e ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. In the mean time, from the town, fire&s;hips and boats were let down the &s;tream to de&s;troy the &s;hipping, which, as they almo&s;t wholly filled the channel, were greatly endangered. But by the ex|traordinary &s;kill and vigilance of Admiral Saunders, every ve&s;&s;el of this kind &s;ent again&s;t them was towed a&s;hore with|out doing the lea&s;t mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="234">The general finding that all his efforts to decoy the enemy to an engagement had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and, &s;en&s;ible that they de&s;ired nothing more than to act defen&s;ively, un|til the &s;ea&s;on it&s;elf &s;hould fight for them and oblige the Engli&s;h to retire, he came at la&s;t, in &s;pite of all difficulties, to the re&s;olution of attacking them in their entrenchments on the &s;ide of Montmorenci. The place where the attack was to be made, was cho&s;en with great judgment, as the only place thereabouts in which the artillery could be brought into u&s;e; as there, and there only, the greate&s;t part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once, and that there the retreat in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e was &s;ecure, at lea&s;t for a certain time of the tide. Having determined upon the place where the attack was to be, which was at the mouth of the river Montmorenci, the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions for it were made, both on the part of the Admiral and of the General.

 <MILESTONE N="July 30."> 

 But notwith&s;tanding that the whole was conducted with equal vigour and prudence, it was totally defeated by one of tho&s;e accidents which &s;o fre|quently interpo&s;e to the di&s;grace of human wi&s;dom, and which demon&s;trates that &s;he is far from being the &s;ole arbi|tre&s;s of war.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h grenadiers, who led the attack, had orders, immediately after their landing, to form them&s;elves on the beach; but in&s;tead of forming them&s;elves as they were di|rected, from the hurry and noi&s;e of their landing, or from an ill-governed ardor, they ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly towards the enemies entrenchments in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and confu&s;i|on, without waiting for the corps which were to &s;u&s;tain them, and join in the attack. In this di&s;order, they were met by a violent and &s;teady fire from the entrenchments, by which they were thrown into more confu&s;ion, and obliged them to &s;helter them&s;elves behind a redoubt, which the French had abandoned on their appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch.</P>
<P>The General perceiving that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e grenadiers to form under &s;o &s;evere a fire, that the night drew on, a violent tempe&s;t was gathering, and the tide began to make, &s;aw clearly that he had nothing further left, than to order a retreat, with as little di&s;advantage as po&s;&s;ible. He therefore called off tho&s;e troops, and having formed behind Brig. Monckton's corps, which was on the beach in excel|lent
<PB N="198" REF="235">
order, the whole repa&s;&s;ed the river without mole&s;tati|on, the General expo&s;ing his per&s;on with that intrepidity, which di&s;tingui&s;hed him both during the attack, and the retreat.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s in this check was not incon&s;iderable; and the event on the whole was &s;uch, as to di&s;courage any further attempts upon that &s;ide. They returned to the old mea&s;ures. The General again &s;ent &s;ome bodies above the town, and &s;ome men of war &s;ailed up the &s;tream for more than twelve leagues. They received intelligence that the enemy had ama&s;&s;ed &s;ome magazines of provi&s;ions in the interior coun|try, and they propo&s;ed by getting between them and the town, to draw the French army from their entrenchments, to the long-de&s;ired engagement; but if they failed to com|pa&s;s this, they might at lea&s;t de&s;troy the &s;hips of war which the enemy had in the river, and help to open a communica|tion between them and Gen. Amher&s;t, on whom their la&s;t expectations were fixed, and who, they flattered them|&s;elves, was on his march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But though they &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying &s;ome of the ene|mies magazines, there was nothing of great moment in this. They could not come near the men of war. How|ever they received intelligence from &s;ome pri&s;oners, of the &s;ucce&s;s of Sir William John&s;on again&s;t Niagara; they learned likewi&s;e, that the French had &s;oothed the difficul|ties in the way of Gen. Amher&s;t, by abandoning Crown Point and Ticonderoga. But this intelligence, otherwi&s;e &s;o plea&s;ing, brought them no pro&s;pect of the approach of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter. The &s;ea&s;on wa&s;ted apace. The General fell violently ill, con&s;umed by care, watching, and a fatigue, too great to be &s;upported by a delicate con&s;ti|tution, and a body unequal to that vigorous and enterpri&s;ing &s;oul that it lodged. It was not enough for him to e&s;cape from &s;o great an expedition uncondemned and unapplauded; to be pitied, was he thought but a milder cen&s;ure; and he knew that no military conduct can &s;hine, unle&s;s it be gild|ed with &s;ucce&s;s. His own high notions, the public hope, the good &s;ucce&s;s of other commanders, all turned inward upon him, oppre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits, and converted di&s;appoint|ment into di&s;ea&s;e.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wi&s;h I could, upon this occa&s;ion, have the honour of tran&s;|mitting to you a more favourable account of the progre&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's arms; but the ob&s;tacles we have met with, in the ope|rations of the campaign, are much greater than we had rea&s;on to expect, or could fore&s;ee; not &s;o much from the number of the enemy (tho' &s;uperiour to us) as from the natural &s;trength of the country, which the Marquis <HI>de Montcalm</HI> &s;eems wi&s;ely to depend upon.</P>
<P>When I learned that &s;uccours of all kinds had been thrown in|to <HI>Quebec;</HI> that five battalions of regular troops, completed from the be&s;t of the inhabitants of the country, &s;ome of the troops of the colony, and every <HI>Canadian</HI> that was able to bear arms, be|&s;ides &s;everal nations of &s;avages, had taken the field in a very ad|vantageous &s;ituation; I could not flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hould be able to reduce the place. I &s;ought however an occa&s;ion to attack their army, knowing well, that with the&s;e troops I was able to fight, and hoping that a victory might di&s;per&s;e them.</P>
<P>We found them incamped along the &s;hore of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> from the river St. <HI>Charles</HI> to the falls of <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> and intrenched in every acce&s;&s;ible part. The 27th of June we landed upon the i&s;le of <HI>Orleans;</HI> but receiving a me&s;&s;age from the Admiral, that there was rea&s;on to think the enemy had artillery, and a force upon the point of <HI>Levi,</HI> I detached Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI> with four bat|talions to them from thence. He pa&s;&s;ed the river the 29th at night, and marched the next day to the point; he obliged the enemy's irregulars to retire, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of that po&s;t: The advanced parties upon this occa&s;ion had two or three &s;kir|mi&s;hes with the <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> with little lo&s;s on either &s;ide.</P>
<PB N="200" REF="237">
<P>Colonel <HI>Carleton</HI> marched with a detachment to the We&s;ter|mo&s;t point of the i&s;le of <HI>Orleans,</HI> from whence our operations were likely to begin.</P>
<P>It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e two points, and for|tify them; becau&s;e from either the one or the other, the enemy might make it impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;hip to be in the ba&s;on of <HI>Quebec,</HI> or even within two miles of it.</P>
<P>Batteries of cannon and mortars were erected with great di&s;|patch on the point of <HI>Levi,</HI> to bombard the town and magazines, and to injure the works and batteries: The enemy perceiving the&s;e works in &s;ome forwardne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the river with 1600 men to attack and de&s;troy them. Unluckily they fell into confu&s;ion, fired upon one another, and went back again; by which we lo&s;t an opportunity of defeating this large detachment. The effect of this artillery has been &s;o great (though acro&s;s the river) that the upper town is con&s;iderably damaged, and the lower town entirely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The works for the &s;ecurity of our ho&s;pitals and &s;tores on the i&s;le of <HI>Orleans</HI> being fini&s;hed, on the 9th of <HI>July</HI> at night, we pa&s;&s;ed the North channel, and incamped near the enemy's left, the river <HI>Montmorenci</HI> between us The next morning Captain <HI>Dank</HI>'s Company of Rangers, po&s;ted in a wood to cover &s;ome workmen, were attacked and defeated by a body of <HI>Indians,</HI> and had &s;o many killed and wounded, as to be almo&s;t di&s;abled for the re&s;t of the campaign: The enemy al&s;o &s;uffered in this affair, and were in their turn driven off by the neare&s;t troops.</P>
<P>The ground, to the ea&s;tward of the falls, &s;eemed to be (as it really is) higher than that on the enemy's &s;ide, and to command it in a manner which might be made u&s;eful to us. There is be|&s;ides a ford below the falls, which may be pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome hours in the latter part of the ebb and beginning of the flood tide; and I had hopes, that po&s;&s;ibly means might be found of pa&s;&s;ing the river above, &s;o as to fight the Marquis <HI>de Montcalm,</HI> upon terms of le&s;s di&s;advantage than directly attacking his intrenchments. In reconnoitring the river <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> we found it fordable at a place about three miles up; but the oppo&s;ite bank was intrench|ed, and &s;o &s;teep and woody, that it was to no purpo&s;e to attempt a pa&s;&s;age there. The E&s;cort was twice attacked by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were as often repul&s;ed; but in the&s;e rencounters we had 40 (officers and men) killed and wounded.</P>
<PB N="201" REF="238">
<P>The 18th of <HI>July,</HI> two men of war, two armed &s;loops, and two tran&s;ports with &s;ome troops on board, pa&s;&s;ed by the town without any lo&s;s, and got into the upper river. This enabled me to reconnoitre the country above, where I found the &s;ame attenti|on on the enemy's &s;ide, and great difficulties on ours, ari&s;ing from the nature of the ground, and the ob&s;tacles to our communicati|on with the fleet. But what I feared mo&s;t, was, that if we &s;hould land between the town and the river, Capt. <HI>Rouge,</HI> the body fir&s;t landed could not be reinforced before they were attacked by the enemy's whole army.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties, I thought once of attempt|ing it at St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, about three miles above the town: but perceiving that the enemy were jealous of the de&s;ign, were prepa|ring again&s;t it, and had actually brought artillery and a mortar (which, being &s;o near to <HI>Quebec,</HI> they could increa&s;e as they plea&s;ed) to play upon the &s;hipping; and, as it mu&s;t have been many hours before we could attack them, (even &s;uppo&s;ing a fa|vourable night for the boats to pa&s;s by the town unhurt) it &s;eem|ed &s;o hazardous, that I thought it be&s;t to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>However, to divide the enemy's force, and to draw their at|tention as high up the river as po&s;&s;ible, and to procure &s;ome intel|ligence, I &s;ent a detachment under the command of Col. <HI>Carleton,</HI> to land at the Point <HI>de Trempe,</HI> to attack whatever he might find there, bring off &s;ome pri&s;oners, and all the u&s;eful papers he could get. I had been informed that a number of the inhabitants of <HI>Quebec,</HI> had retired to that place, and that probably we &s;hould find a magazine of provi&s;ions there.</P>
<P>The Colonel was fired upon by a body of <HI>Indians</HI> the moment he landed, but they were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed and driven into the woods: he &s;earched for magazines, but to no purpo&s;e, brought off &s;ome pri&s;oners, and returned with little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>After this bu&s;ine&s;s, I came back to <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> where I found that B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig. <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> had, by a &s;uperior fire, prevented the <HI>French</HI> from erecting a battery on the bank of the river, from whence they intended to cannonade our camp. I now re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity which pre&s;ented it&s;elf of attacking the ene|my, though po&s;ted to great advantage, and every where prepared to receive us.</P>
<P>As the men of war cannot (for want of a &s;ufficient depth of water) come near enough to the enemy's intrenchments to annoy 
<PB N="202" REF="239">
them in the lea&s;t, the Admiral had prepared two tran&s;ports (draw|ing but little water) which upon occa&s;ions could be run a ground, to favour a de&s;cent. With the help of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which I un|der&s;tood would be carried by the tide clo&s;e in &s;hore, I propo&s;ed to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of a detached redoubt near to the water's edge, and who&s;e &s;ituation appeared to be out of mu&s;quet &s;hot of the intrenchment upon the hill: If the enemy &s;upported this de|tatched piece, it would nece&s;&s;arily bring on an engagement, what we mo&s;t wi&s;hed for; and if not, I &s;hould have it in my power to examine their &s;ituation, &s;o as to be able to determine where we could be&s;t attack them.</P>
<P>Preparations were accordingly made for an engagement. The 31&s;t of <HI>July</HI> in the forenoon, the boats of the fleet were filled with grenadiers, and a part of Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI>'s brigade from the point of <HI>Levi:</HI> The two brigades under the Brigadiers <HI>Town|&s;hend</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> were ordered to be in readine&s;s to pa&s;s the ford, when it &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary. To facilitate the pa&s;|&s;age of this corps, the admiral had placed the <HI>Centurion</HI> in the channel, &s;o that &s;he might check the fire of the lower battery which commanded the ford: This &s;hip was of great u&s;e, as her fire was very judiciou&s;ly directed. A great quantity of artillery was placed upon the eminence, &s;o as to batter and enfilade the left of their intrenchments.</P>
<P>From the ve&s;&s;el which run a-ground, neare&s;t in. I ob&s;erved that the redoubt was too much commanded to be kept without very great lo&s;s; and the more, as the two armed &s;hips could not be brought near enough to cover both with their artillery and mu&s;quetry, which I at fir&s;t conceived they might. But as the enemy &s;eemed in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and we were prepared for an action, I thought it a proper time to make an attempt upon their intrenchments. Orders were &s;ent to the Brigadiers Generals to be ready with the corps under their command. Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI> to land, and the Brigadiers <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> to pa&s;s the ford.</P>
<P>At a proper time of the tide, the &s;ignal was made, but in row|ing towards the &s;hore, many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the boats grounded upon a ledge that runs of a con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance. This accident put us into &s;ome di&s;order, lo&s;t a great deal off time, and obliged me to &s;end an officer to &s;top Brig. <HI>Tow&s;hend</HI>'s march, whom I then ob&s;erv|ed to be in motion. While the &s;eamen were getting the boats off, 
<PB N="203" REF="240">
the enemy fired a number of &s;hells and &s;hot, but did no con&s;ide|rable damage. As &s;oon as this di&s;order could be &s;et a little to rights, and the boats were ranged in a proper manner, &s;ome of the officers of the navy went in with me, to find a better place to land: we took one flat-bottomed boat with us to make the ex|periment, and as &s;oon as we had found a fit part of the &s;hore, the troops were ordered to di&s;embark, thinking it not yet too late for the attempt.</P>
<P>The 13 companies of grenadiers, and 200 of the &s;cond <HI>Royal American</HI> battalion, got fir&s;t on &s;hore. The grenadiers were or|dered to form them&s;elves into four di&s;tinct bodies, and to begin the attack, &s;upported by Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI>'s corps, as &s;oon as the troops had pa&s;&s;ed the ford, and were at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t. But whe|ther from the noi&s;e and hurry at landing, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, the grenadiers, in&s;tead of forming them&s;elves as they were directed, ran on impetuou&s;ly towards the enemy's intrenchments in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and confu&s;ion, without waiting for the corps which were to &s;u&s;tain them, and join in the attack. Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI> was not landed, and Brig. <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> was &s;till at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, though upon his march to join us, in very great order. The grenadiers were checked by the enemy's fir&s;t fire, and obliged to &s;helter them&s;elves in or about the redoubt, which the <HI>French</HI> abandoned upon their approach. In this &s;itua|tion they continued for &s;ome time, unable to form under &s;o hot a fire, and having many gallant officers wounded, who (carele&s;s of their per&s;ons) had been &s;olely intent upon their duty. I &s;aw the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of calling them off, that they might form them&s;elves behind Brig. <HI>Monckton</HI>'s corps, which was now landed, and drawn up on the beach, in extreme good order.</P>
<P>By this new accident, and this &s;econd delay, it was near night, a &s;udden &s;torm came on, and the tide began to make; &s;o that I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable, not to per&s;evere in &s;o difficult an at|tack, le&s;t (in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e) the retreat of Brig. <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>'s corps might be hazardous and uncertain.</P>
<P>Our artillery had a great effect upon the enemy's left, where Brigadiers <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> were to have attacked; and, it is probable that if tho&s;e accidents I have &s;poken of, had not happened, we &s;hould have penetrated there, whil&s;t our left and centre (more remote from our artillery) mu&s;t have bore all the violence of their mu&s;quetry.</P>
<PB N="204" REF="241">
<P>The French did not attempt to interrupt our march. Some of their &s;avages came down to murder &s;uch wounded as could not be brought off, and to &s;calp the dead, as their cu&s;tom is.</P>
<P>The place where the attack was intended, has the&s;e advanta|ges over all others hereabout. Our artillery could be brought into u&s;e. The greate&s;t part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once. And the retreat (in ca&s;e of repul&s;e) was &s;e|cure, at lea&s;t for a certain time of the tide. Neither one or other of the&s;e advantages can any where el&s;e be found. The enemy were indeed po&s;ted upon a commanding eminence. The beach upon which the troops were drawn up, was of deep mud, with holes, and cut by &s;everal gullies. The hill to be a&s;cended very &s;teep, and not every where practicable. The enemy numerous in their intrenchments, and their fire hot. If the attack had &s;uc|ceeded, our lo&s;s mu&s;t certainly have been great, and their's in|con&s;iderable, from the &s;helter which the neighbouring woods af|forded them. The river St. <HI>Charles</HI> &s;till remained to be pa&s;&s;ed, before the town was inverted. All the&s;e circum&s;tances I con&s;i|dered; but the de&s;ire to act in conformity to the King's intenti|ons, induced me to make this trial, per&s;uaded that a victorious army finds no difficulties.</P>
<P>The enemy have been fortifying ever &s;ince with care, &s;o as to make a &s;econd attempt &s;till more dangerous.</P>
<P>Immediately after this check, I &s;ent Brig. <HI>Murray</HI> above the town with 1200 men, directing him to a&s;&s;i&s;t Rear Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> in the de&s;truction of the <HI>French</HI> &s;hips (if they could be got at) in order to open a communication with Gen. <HI>Amher&s;t.</HI> The Briga|dier was to &s;eek every favourable opportunity of fighting &s;ome of the enemy's detachments, provided he could do it upon tolerable terms, and to u&s;e all the means in his power to provoke them to attack him. He made two different attempts to and upon the North &s;hore without &s;ucce&s;s; but in a third was more fortunate. He landed unexpectedly at <HI>De Chambaud,</HI> and burnt a magazine there, in which were &s;ome provi&s;ions, &s;ome ammunition, and all the &s;pare &s;tores, clothing, arms, and baggage, of their army.</P>
<P>Finding that their &s;hips were not to be got at, and little pro&s;|pect of bringing the enemy to a battle, he reported his &s;ituation to me, and I ordered him to join the army.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners he took informed him of the &s;urrender of the fort of <HI>Niagara;</HI> and we di&s;covered, by intercepted letters, that 
<PB N="205" REF="242">
the enemy had abandoned <HI>Carillon</HI> and <HI>Crown Point,</HI> were reti|red to the i&s;le <HI>Aux Noix;</HI> and that Gen. <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> was making pre|parations to pa&s;s the Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> to fall upon M. <HI>de Bourle|maque</HI>'s corps, which con&s;i&s;ts of three battalions of foot, and as many <HI>Canadians</HI> as make the whole amount to 3000 men.</P>
<P>The Admiral's di&s;patches and mine would have gone eight or ten days &s;ooner, if I had not been prevented from writing by a fever. I found my&s;elf &s;o ill, and am &s;till &s;o weak, that I begged the general officers to con&s;ult together for the public utility. They are all of opinion, that (as more &s;hips and provi&s;ions have now got above the town) they &s;hould try, by conveying up a corps of 4 or 5000 men (which is nearly the whole &s;trength of the army, after the points of <HI>Levi</HI> and <HI>Orleans</HI> are left in a proper &s;tate of defence) to draw the enemy from their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and bring them to an action. I have acquie&s;ced in their propo&s;al, and we are preparing to put it in execution.</P>
<P>The Admiral and I have examined the town, with a view to a general a&s;&s;ault; but, after con&s;ulting with the chief engineer, who is well acquainted with the interior parts of it, and, after viewing it with the utmo&s;t attention, we found, that though the batteries of the Lower Town might be ea&s;ily &s;ilenced by the men of war, yet the bu&s;ine&s;s of an a&s;&s;ault would be little advanced by that, &s;ince the few pa&s;&s;ages that lead from the Lower to the Up|per Town, are carefully intrenched; and the upper batteries can|not be affected by the &s;hips, which mu&s;t receive con&s;iderable da|mage from them and from the mortars. The Admiral would rea|dily join in this, or in any other mea&s;ure, for the public &s;ervice; but I could not propo&s;e to him an undertaking of &s;o dangerous a nature, and promi&s;ing &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To the uncommon &s;trength of the country, the enemy have ad|ded (for the defence of the river) a great number of floating bat|teries and boats. By the vigilance of the&s;e and the <HI>Indians</HI> round our different po&s;ts, it has been impo&s;&s;ible to execute any thing by &s;urprize. We have had almo&s;t daily &s;kirmi&s;hes with the&s;e Sava|ges, in which they are generally defeated, but not without lo&s;s on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>By the li&s;t of di&s;abled officers (many of whom are of rank) you may perceive, Sir, that the army is much weakened. By the na|ture of the river, the mo&s;t formidable part of this armament is de|prived 
<PB N="206" REF="243">
of the power of acting, yet we have almo&s;t the whole force of <HI>Canada</HI> to oppo&s;e. In this &s;ituation, there is &s;uch a choice of difficulties, that I own my&s;elf at a lo&s;s how to determine. The affairs of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I know, require the mo&s;t vigourous mea|&s;ures; but then the courage of a handful of brave men &s;hould be exerted only where there is &s;ome hope of a favourable event. However, you may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that the &s;mall part of the cam|paign which remains, &s;hall be employed (as far as I am able) for the honour of his Maje&s;ty and the intere&s;t of the nation, in which I am &s;ure of being well &s;econded by the Admiral and by the Generals. Happy if our efforts here can contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's arms in any other parts of <HI>America.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Sterling-Ca&s;tle off Point Levi, in the River St. Lawrence, <DATE>5th of September, <HI>1759.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the 6th of <HI>June,</HI> I acquainted you I was then off <HI>Scutari,</HI> &s;tanding for the river St. <HI>Laurence.</HI> On the 26th, I had got up, with the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the fleet and tran&s;ports, as far as the middle of the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans,</HI> where I immediately pre|pared to land the troops, which I did the next morning. The &s;ame day the &s;econd and third divi&s;ions came up, and the troops from them were landed likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>I got thus far without any lo&s;s or accident whatever; but, di|rectly after landing the troops, a very hard gale of wind came on, by which many anchors and &s;mall boats were lo&s;t, and much da|mage received among the tran&s;ports, by their driving on board each other. The &s;hips that lo&s;t mo&s;t anchors I &s;upplied from the men of war as far as I was able, and in all other re&s;pects, gave them the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power.</P>
<PB N="207" REF="244">
<P>On the 28th, at midnight, the enemy &s;ent down from <HI>Quebec</HI> &s;even fire&s;hips; and though our &s;hips and tran&s;ports were &s;o nu|merous, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;pread &s;o great a part of the channel, we towed them all clear and a-ground, without receiving the lea&s;t damage from them. The next night Gen. <HI>Monckton</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the river, and landed with his Brigade on the South &s;hore, and took po&s;t at Point <HI>Levi;</HI> and Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> took his on the We&s;tmo&s;t Point of the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> I moved up between the Points of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Levi;</HI> and, it being re&s;olved to land on the North &s;hore, be|low the falls of <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> I placed on the 8th in&s;t. his Maje&s;|ty's &s;loop the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> and the <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> armed ve&s;&s;el, in the channel between <HI>Orleans</HI> and the North &s;hore, to cover that land|ing, which took place at night.</P>
<P>On the 17th, I ordered Capt. <HI>Rous</HI> of the <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to pro|ceed, with the fir&s;t fair wind and night tide, above the town of <HI>Quebec,</HI> and to take with him his maje&s;ty's &s;hips <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Squir|rel,</HI> with two armed &s;loops, and two catts armed and loaded with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the 18th, at night, they all got up, except the <HI>Diana,</HI> and gave Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> an opportunity of reconnoitring above the town, tho&s;e &s;hips having carried &s;ome troops with them for that pur|po&s;e. The <HI>Diana</HI> ran a&s;hore upon the rocks off Point <HI>Levi,</HI> and received &s;o much damage, that I have &s;ent her to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with 27 &s;ail of <HI>American</HI> tran&s;ports, (tho&s;e which received mo&s;t damage in the gale of the 27th of <HI>June</HI>) where they are to be di&s;charged; and the <HI>Diana,</HI> having repaired her damages, is to proceed to <HI>England,</HI> taking with her the ma&s;t &s;hips, and what trade may be ready to accompany her.</P>
<P>On the 28th, at mignight, the enemy &s;ent down a raft of fire-&s;tages, of near a hundred Radeaux, which &s;ucceeded no better than the fire-&s;hips.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> determined to land a number of troops above the falls of <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> in order to attack the enemy's lines; to cover which, I placed the <HI>Centurion</HI> in the channel, be|tween the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans</HI> and the falls, and ran on &s;hore, at high water, two catts which I had armed for that purpo&s;e, again&s;t two &s;mall batteries and two redoubts, where our troops were to land. About &s;ix in the evening they landed, but the Generel not think|ing it proper to per&s;evere in the attack; &s;oon after, part of them 
<PB N="208" REF="245">
re-embarked, and the re&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the Falls with Gen. <HI>Wolfe;</HI> upon which, to prevent the two catts from falling into the ene|my's hands (they being then dry on &s;hore) I gave orders to take the men out and &s;et them on fire, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>On the 5th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the night, I &s;ent twenty flat-bottom|ed boats up the river, to the <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to embark 1260 of the troops, with Brig. Gen. <HI>Murray,</HI> from a po&s;t he had taken on the &s;outh &s;hore. I &s;ent Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> up to the <HI>Sutherland,</HI> to act in concert with him, and give him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance the &s;hips and boats could afford. At the &s;ame time I directed Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to get at, and de&s;troy the enemy's &s;hips above the town; and for that purpo&s;e I ordered the <HI>Lowe&s;toffe,</HI> and <HI>Hunter</HI> &s;loop, with two armed &s;loops and two catts, with pro|vi&s;ions, to pa&s;s <HI>Quebec</HI> and join the <HI>Sutherland;</HI> but the wind holding we&s;terly, it was the 27th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> before they got up, which was the fourth attempt they had made to gain their pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>On the 25th, at night, Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> and Gen. <HI>Murray,</HI> with part of the troops, returned; they had met with, and de|&s;troyed a magazine of the enemy's cloathing, &s;ome gunpowder, and other things; and Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> had been ten or twelve leagues above the town, but found it impracticable at that time to get farther up.</P>
<P>Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> having re&s;olved to quit the camp at <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> and go above the town, in hopes of getting between the enemy and their provi&s;ions, (&s;uppo&s;ed to be in the &s;hips there) and by that means force them to an action, I &s;ent up, on the 29th at night, the <HI>Seahor&s;e</HI> and two armed &s;loops, with two catts laden with provi&s;ions, to join the re&s;t above <HI>Quebec;</HI> and having taken off all the artillery, from the camp at <HI>Montmorenci,</HI> on the 3d in&s;t. in the afternoon the troops embarked from thence, and land|ed at Point <HI>Levi.</HI> The 4th, at night, I &s;ent all the flat-bottomed boats up, and this night a part of the troops will march up the &s;outh &s;hore, above the town, to be embarked in the &s;hips and ve&s;|&s;els there, and to-morrow night the re&s;t will follow. Admiral <HI>Holmes</HI> is al&s;o gone up again to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their future operations, and to try, if, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the troops, it is practicable to get at the enemy's &s;hips.</P>
<P>As Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> writes by this opportunity, he will give you an account of his part of the operations, and his thoughts what fur|ther 
<PB N="209" REF="246">
may be done for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. The enemy appear numerous, and &s;eem to be &s;trongly po&s;ted; but let the event be what it will, we &s;hall remain here as long as the &s;ea&s;on will per|mit, in order to prevent their detaching troops from hence again&s;t Gen. <HI>Amher&s;t;</HI> and I &s;hall leave cruizers at the mouth of the ri|ver, to cut off any &s;upplies that may be &s;ent them, with &s;trict or|ders to keep that &s;tation as long as po&s;&s;ible. The town of <HI>Quebec</HI> is not habitable, being almo&s;t entirely burnt and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>I enclo&s;e you the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;hips under my com|mand: twenty of the victuallers that &s;ailed from <HI>England</HI> with the <HI>Echo,</HI> are arrived here, one unloaded at <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> having re|ceived damage in her pa&s;&s;age out, and another I have heard no|thing of. No &s;hips of the enemy have come this way, that I have had any intelligence of, &s;ince my arrival in the river except one, laden with flour and brandy, which was taken by Capt. <HI>Drake</HI> of the <HI>Lizard.</HI></P>
<P>Before Admiral <HI>Durell</HI> got into the river, three frigates, and &s;eventeen &s;ail, with provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and a few recruits, got up, and are tho&s;e we are &s;o anxious, if po&s;&s;ible, to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday I received a letter from Gen <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> (to whom I have had no opportunity of writing &s;ince I have been in the river) dated Camp off <HI>Crown Point, Augu&s;t</HI> 17th, wherein, he only de&s;ires I would &s;end tran&s;ports and a convoy to <HI>New York,</HI> to carry to <HI>England</HI> &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy pri&s;oners taken at the &s;urrender of <HI>Niagara.</HI></P>
<P>I would have wrote to you &s;ooner from hence, but while my di&s;patches were preparing, Gen. <HI>Wolfe</HI> was taken very ill; he has been better &s;ince, but is &s;till greatly out of order.</P>

de&s;ign of Wolfe was deeper, and more particularly direct|ed than it had been before. The camp at Montmorenci was broke up, and the troops were conveyed to the &s;outh|ea&s;t
<PB N="203" REF="240">
of the river, and encamped at Point Levi. The &s;qua|dron under Admiral Holmes made movements up the river for &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in order to draw the enemies
<PB N="204" REF="241">
attention as far from the town as po&s;&s;ible. This &s;ucceeded in &s;ome mea&s;ure; for, though it could not per&s;uade the Marquis de Montcalm to quit his po&s;t, it induced him to
<PB N="205" REF="242">
detach M. de Bougainville with 1500 men to watch their motions, and to proceed along the we&s;tern &s;hore of the river, whil&s;t the Engli&s;h army directed its march the &s;ame way on the ea&s;tern bank.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="243">When Gen. Wolfe &s;aw that matters were ripe for action, he ordered the &s;hips under Admiral Saunders to make a feint, as if they propo&s;ed to attack the French in their en|trenchments,
<PB N="207" REF="244">
on the Beauport &s;hore below the town, and by their motions to give this feint all the appearance of a reality which it po&s;&s;ibly could have. This di&s;po&s;ition be|ing
<PB N="208" REF="245">
made below the town, the General embarked his forces about one in the morning, and with Admiral Holmes's di|vi&s;ion went three leagues further up the river than the in|tended
<PB N="209" REF="246">
place of his landing, in order to amu&s;e the enemy, and conceal his real de&s;ign. Then he put them into boats, and fell down &s;ilently with the tide, unob&s;erved by the French centinels po&s;ted along the &s;hore. The rapidity of the current carried the&s;e boats a little below the intend|ed place of attack. The &s;hips followed them, and arrived ju&s;t at the time which had been concerted to cover their
<PB N="210" REF="247">
landing. Con&s;idering the darkne&s;s of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation, and it required excellent heads both on the part of the marine, and the land &s;ervice, to pre&s;erve a communication, and to prevent a di&s;covery and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the troops could not land at the &s;pot propo&s;ed, when they were put on &s;hore an hill appeared before them ex|tremely high and &s;teep in its a&s;cent; a little path winded up this a&s;cent, &s;o narrow that two could not go abrea&s;t. Even this path was intrenched, and a captain's guard de|fended it. The&s;e difficulties did not abate the hopes of the General, or the ardor of the troops. The light infantry under Colonel Howe laying hold of &s;tumps and boughs of trees, pulled them&s;elves up, di&s;lodged the guards, and cleared the path; and then all the troops &s;urmounting eve|ry difficulty, gained the top of the hill, and as fa&s;t as they a&s;cended formed them&s;elves, &s;o that they were all in order of battle at day break.</P>
<P>Montcalm, when he heard that the Engli&s;h had a&s;cended the hill,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 13."> 

 and were formed on the high ground at the back of the town, &s;carcely credited the intel|ligence, and &s;till believed it to be a feint to induce him to abandon that &s;trong po&s;t, which had been the object of all the real attempts that had been made &s;ince the beginning of the campaign. But he was &s;oon, and fatally for him, undeceived. He &s;aw clearly, that the Engli&s;h fleet and ar|my were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that the upper and lower town might be attacked in concert, and that nothing but a battle could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave it. Accordingly he determined to give them battle, and quitting Beauport, pa&s;&s;ed the river St. Charles, and formed his troops oppo&s;ite to ours.</P>
<P>He filled the bu&s;hes that were in his front with detach|ments of Indians, and his be&s;t mark&s;men, to the number of about 1500; his regular forces formed his left; his right was compo&s;ed of the troops of the colony, &s;upported by two battali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns of regulars. The re&s;t of the Indians and Canadians extended on that &s;ide, and attempted to out-flank the left of the Engli&s;h, which was formed to prevent that de&s;ign, in a manner which the military men call <HI>Po|tence;</HI> that is, in a body which pre&s;ents two faces to the enemy. Here Brigadier General Town&s;hend commanded &s;ix regiments, and the Loui&s;bourg grenadiers were di&s;po&s;|ed in a line to the right of this body, extending to the ri|ver.
<PB N="211" REF="248">
A regiment was drawn up behind the right for a re|&s;erve. It was formed in eight &s;ubdivi&s;ions, with large in|tervals. The light infantry under Colonel Howe, protect|ed the rear and the left. The di&s;po&s;itions on both &s;ides were judicious, and the engagement on both &s;ides began with &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h troops were exhorted to re&s;erve their fire; and they bore that of the enemy's light troops in front, which was galling, though irregular, with the utmo&s;t pa|tience and good order, waiting for the main body of the e|nemy, which advanced fa&s;t upon them. At forty yards di|&s;tance, our troops gave their fire, which took place in its full extent, and made a terrible havock among the French. It was &s;upported with as much vivacity as it was begun, and the enemy every where yielded to it; but ju&s;t in the moment, when the fortune of the field began to declare it&s;elf, General Wolfe, in who&s;e life every thing &s;eemed included, fell: General Monckton, the next to him in command, fell immediately after, and both were conveyed out of the line; the command now devolved on General Town&s;hend. It was at a very critical time. For, though the enemy began to fall back, and were much broken, the lo&s;s of the two generals was a very di&s;couraging circum|&s;tance, and it required great temper and great exertions to &s;upport the advantages that had been gained, and to pu&s;h them to their proper extent. General Town&s;hend &s;hewed him&s;elf equal to &s;o arduous a duty; the troops pre&s;erved their &s;pirit, and each corps &s;eemed to exert it&s;elf with a view to its peculiar character. The grenadiers with their bayonets, the Highlanders with their broad &s;words, and the re&s;t of the forces, with a &s;teady and continued fire, drove the enemy in great di&s;order from every po&s;t, and compleat|ed their defeat. During the whole action, Colonel Howe with his light infantry covered the left wing in &s;uch a man|ner, as entirely to fru&s;trate the attempts of the enemies In|dians and Canadians upon that flank.</P>
<P>The field now &s;eemed to be compleatly decided, when a new enemy appeared, which threatened to bring on a fre&s;h engagement, and to put all again to the hazard. M. de Bougainville, whom the feigned movements of the Engli&s;h troops had drawn up the river, turned back on di&s;covering their real de&s;ign, and now appeared on the rear of the army, with a body of 2000 men. But fortunately the main body
<PB N="212" REF="249">
of the French was by this time &s;o broken and di&s;per&s;ed, that the General was able to e&s;tabli&s;h his rear, and to turn &s;uch an oppo&s;ition on that &s;ide that the enemy retired after a very feeble attempt.</P>
<P>In this deci&s;ive action our troops lo&s;t about 500 men; on the &s;ide of the enemy at lea&s;t 1500 were killed. But however glorious this victory was, and however important in its con&s;equences, it mu&s;t be admitted that it was very dearly bought. Soldiers may be rai&s;ed; officers will be formed by experience; but the lo&s;s of a genius in war, is a lo&s;s which we know not how to repair. The death of Wolfe was indeed grievous to his country, but to him&s;elf the mo&s;t happy that can be imagined; and the mo&s;t to be envied by all tho&s;e who have a true reli&s;h for military glory. Unindebted to family, or connections, un&s;upported by in|trigue or faction, he had accompli&s;hed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life at a time, when others are only beginning to appear; and at the age of thirty-five, without feeling the weakne&s;s of age or the vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, having &s;atisfied his hone&s;t ambition, having compleated his character, having fulfilled the expectations of his country, he fell at the head of his conquering troops, and expired in the arms of victory.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances that attended the death of &s;uch a per&s;on, are too intere&s;ting to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, and they were indeed &s;uch as &s;poke the whole tenor of his life. He fir&s;t received a wound in his head; but, that he might not di&s;courage his troops, he wrapped it up in his hanker|chief, and encouraged his men to advance: &s;oon after he received another b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in his belly; this al&s;o he di&s;&s;embled, and exerted him&s;elf as before; when he received a third in his brea&s;t, under which he at la&s;t &s;unk, and &s;uffered him&s;elf, unwillingly, to be carried behind the ranks. As he lay &s;truggling with the angui&s;h and weakne&s;s of three grievous wounds, he &s;eemed only &s;ollicitous about the fortune of the battle. He begged one, who attended him, to &s;upport him to view the field; but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed and confu&s;ed his &s;ight, he de&s;ired an officer, who was by him, to give him an account of what he &s;aw. The officer an&s;wered, that the enemy &s;eemed broken; he repeated his que&s;tion a few minutes after with much anxiety, when he was told that the enemy was totally routed, and that they fled in all parts. Then, &s;aid he, "I am &s;atisfied;" and immediately he expired.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="250">Without the &s;ame advantages, the enemy al&s;o had an heavy lo&s;s in this battle, which, no doubt, contributed to their defeat. M. de Montcalm, commander in chief, was killed on the &s;pot; an officer who had done the highe&s;t &s;ervices to his country throughout the whole American war, and perfectly &s;upported his reputation in this la&s;t &s;eene of it, having made the mo&s;t perfect di&s;po&s;itions that human prudence could &s;ugge&s;t, both before the battle and in the engagement. It is &s;omething remarkable that in both ar|mies, the fir&s;t in command &s;hould be killed, and the &s;econd dangerou&s;ly wounded. But General Monckton happily re|covered, the French officer died a little after the battle.</P>
<P>Five days after the action, the enemy &s;eeing that the communication between the town and the army was cut off,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 18."> 

 and that the Engli&s;h fleet and troops were preparing with all vigour for a &s;iege, &s;ur|rendered the city of Quebec upon terms of honour to the garri&s;on, and advantage to the inhabitants, who were pre|&s;erved in the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their civil rights, until a general peace &s;hould decide their future condition. The fortifications of the city were in tolerable order; the hou&s;es almo&s;t totally demoli&s;hed. A garri&s;on of 5000 men under General Murray, were put into the place, with a plenty of provi&s;ions and ammunition for the winter. The fleet &s;ailed to England &s;oon after, fearing le&s;t the &s;etting in of the fro&s;ts &s;hould lock them up in the river St. Laurence. ^(^a^)</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the honour to acquaint you with the &s;ucce&s;s of his ma|je&s;ty's arms, on the 13th in&s;t. in an action with the <HI>French,</HI> on the heights to the we&s;tward of this town.</P>
<P>It being determined to carry the operations above the town the po&s;ts at <HI>Point Levi,</HI> and <HI>l'I&s;le d'Orleans,</HI> being &s;ecured, the General marched with the remainder of the force, from <HI>Point Levi,</HI> the 5th and 6th, and embarked them in tran&s;ports, which had pa&s;&s;ed the town for that purpo&s;e. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, a movement of the &s;hips was made up, by Admiral <HI>Holmes,</HI> in or|der to amu&s;e the enemy now po&s;ted along the North &s;hore; but the tran&s;ports being extremely crowded, and the weather very bad, the General thought proper to cantoon half his troops on the South &s;hore; where they were refre&s;hed, and reimbarked up|on the 12th at one in the morning. The light infantry, com|manded by Col. <HI>Howe,</HI> the regiments of <HI>Bragg, Kennedy, La&s;celles,</HI> and <HI>An&s;truther,</HI> with a detachment of <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and the <HI>American</HI> grenadiers, the whole being under the command of Brigadiers <HI>Monckton</HI> and <HI>Murray,</HI> were put into flat-bottomed boats, and, after &s;ome movements of the &s;hips, made by Admiral <HI>Holmes,</HI> to draw the attention of the enemy above, the boats fell down with the tide, and landed on the North &s;hore, within a league of Cape <HI>Diamond,</HI> an hour before day-break: the rapidity of the tide of ebb carried them a little below the intended place of attack, which obliged the light infantry to &s;cramble up a
<PB N="215" REF="252">
woody precipice, in order to &s;ecure the landing the troops by di&s;lodging a captain's po&s;t, which defended the &s;mall intrenched path the troops were to a&s;cend. After a little firing, the light infantry gained the top of the precipice, and di&s;per&s;ed the Cap|tain's po&s;t; by which means, the troops, with a very little lo&s;s, from a few <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in the wood, got up, and were immediately formed. The boats, as they emptied, were &s;ent back for the &s;econd embarkation, which I immediately made. Brigadier <HI>Murray,</HI> who had been detached with <HI>An&s;truther</HI>'s battalion to attack the Four Gun Battery upon the left, was re|called by the General, who now &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> army cro&s;&s;ing the river St. <HI>Charles.</HI> General <HI>Wolfe</HI> thereupon begun to form his line, having his right covered by the <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> grenadiers; on the right of the&s;e again he afterwards brought <HI>Otway</HI>'s; to the left of the grenadiers were <HI>Bragg</HI>'s, <HI>Kennedy</HI>'s, <HI>La&s;celles</HI>'s, <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and <HI>An&s;truther</HI>'s; the right of this body was com|manded by Brigadier <HI>Monckton,</HI> and the left by Brigadier <HI>Murray;</HI> his rear and left were protected by Col. <HI>Howe</HI>'s Light-infantry, who was returned from the Four Gun Battery before-mentioned, which was &s;oon abandoned to him. General <HI>Montcalm</HI> having collected the whole of his force from the <HI>Beauport</HI> &s;ide, and ad|vancing, &s;hewed his intention to flank our left, where I was immediately ordered with General <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s battalion, which I formed <HI>en potence.</HI> My numbers were &s;oon after encrea&s;ed by the arrival of the two battalions of <HI>Royal Americans;</HI> and <HI>Webb</HI>'s was drawn up by the General, as a re&s;erve, in eight &s;ubdivi&s;ions with large intervals. The enemy lined the bu&s;hes in their front with 1500 <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Canadians,</HI> and I dare &s;ay had placed mo&s;t of their be&s;t mark&s;men there, who kept up a very galling, tho' irregular, fire upon our whole line, who bore it with the great|e&s;t patience, and good order, re&s;erving their fire for the main body now advancing. This fire of the enemy was however checked by our po&s;ts in our front, which protected the forming our own line. The right of the enemy was compo&s;ed of half of the troops of the colony, the battalion of <HI>La Sarre Languedoc,</HI> and the remainder of the <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> Their centre was a column, and formed by the battalions of <HI>Bearn</HI> and <HI>Gui|enne.</HI> Their left was compo&s;ed of the remainder of the troops of the colony, and the battalion of <HI>Royal Rou&s;illon.</HI> This was, as near as I can gue&s;s, their line of battle. They brought up
<PB N="216" REF="253">
two pieces of &s;mall artillery again&s;t us, and we had been able to bring up but one gun; which being admirably well &s;erved, galled their column exceedingly. My attention to the left will not permit me to be very exact with regard to every circum&s;tance which pa&s;&s;ed in the centre, much le&s;s to the right; but it is mo&s;t certain, that the enemy formed in good order, and that their attack was very bri&s;k and animated on that &s;ide. Our troops re&s;erved their fire, till within forty yards, which was &s;o well continued, that the enemy every where gave way. It was then our General fell at the head of <HI>Bragg</HI>'s, and the <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> grenadiers, advancing with their bayonets: About the &s;ame time Brigadier-general <HI>Monckton</HI> received his wound at the head of <HI>La&s;celles</HI>'s. In the front of the oppo&s;ite battalion fell al&s;o M. <HI>Montcalm;</HI> and his &s;econd in command is &s;ince dead of his wounds on board our fleet. Part of the enemy made a &s;econd faint attack. Part took to &s;ome thick cop&s;e wood, and &s;eemed to make a &s;tand. It was at this moment, that each corps &s;eemed in a manner to exert it&s;elf, with a view to its own pecu|liar character. The grenadiers, <HI>Bragg</HI>'s, and <HI>La&s;celles</HI>'s, pre&s;&s;ed on with their bayonets. Brigadier <HI>Murray,</HI> advancing with the troops under his command, bri&s;kly compleated their rout on this &s;ide; when the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> &s;upported by <HI>Ar&s;truther</HI>'s, took to their broad &s;words, and drove part into the town, and part to the works at their bridge on the river <HI>St. Charles.</HI></P>
<P>The action, on our left and rear, was not &s;o &s;evere. The hou&s;es, into which the Light Infantry were thrown, were well defended, being &s;upported by Col. <HI>Howe,</HI> who taking po&s;t with two companies behind a &s;mall cop&s;e, and frequently &s;allying upon the flanks of the enemy during the attack, drove them often into heaps, again&s;t the front of which body I advanced platoons of <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s regiment, which totally prevented the right wing from executing their fir&s;t intention. Before this, one of the <HI>Royal American</HI> battalions had been detached to pre&s;erve our communi|cation with our boats, and the other being &s;ent to occupy the ground which Brigadier <HI>Murray</HI>'s movement had left open, I re|mained with <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s to &s;upport this di&s;po&s;ition, and to keep the enemy's right, and a body of their &s;avages, which waited &s;till more towards our rear, oppo&s;ite the po&s;ts of our Light In|fantry, waiting for an opportunity to fall upon our rear.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was the &s;ituation of things, when I was told, in the
<PB N="217" REF="254">
action, that I commanded: I immediately repaired to the centre, and finding the pur&s;uit had put part of the troops in di&s;order, I formed them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Scarce was this effected, when M. <HI>de Bougainville,</HI> with his corps from <HI>Cape Rouge</HI> of 2000 men, appeared in our rear. I advanced two pieces of artillery, and two battalions towards him; upon which he retired. You will not, I flatter my&s;elf, blame me for not quitting &s;uch advantageous ground, and ri&s;king the fate of &s;o deci&s;ive a day, by &s;eeking a fre&s;h enemy, po&s;ted perhaps in the very kind of ground he could wi&s;h for, viz. woods and &s;wamps.</P>
<P>We took a great number of <HI>French</HI> officers upon the field of battle, and one piece of cannon. Their lo&s;s is computed to be about 1500 men, which fell chiefly upon their regulars.</P>
<P>I have been employed, from the day of action to that of the capitulation, in redoubting our camp beyond in&s;ult, in making a road up the precipice for our cannon, in getting up the artillery, preparing the batteries, and cutting off their communication with the country. The 17th, at noon, before we had any battery erected, or could have any for two or three days, a flag of truce came out with propo&s;als of capitulation, which I &s;ent back again to the town, allowing them four hours to capitulate, or no farther treaty. The Admiral had, at this time, brought up his large &s;hips as intending to attack the town. The <HI>French</HI> officer returned at night with terms of capitulation, which, with the Admiral, were con&s;idered, agreed to, and &s;igned at eight in the morning, the 18th in&s;tant. The terms we granted, will I flatter my&s;elf, be approved of by his Maje&s;ty, con&s;idering the enemy a&s;&s;embling in our rear, and what is far more formidable, the very wet and cold &s;ea&s;on, which threatened our troops with &s;ickne&s;s, and the fleet with &s;ome accident; it had made our road &s;o bad, we could not bring up a gun for &s;ome time; add to this, the advantage of entering the town, with the walls in a defen&s;ible &s;tate, and the being able to put a garri&s;on there &s;trong enough to prevent all &s;urprize. The&s;e, I hope, will be deemed &s;ufficient con&s;iderations for granting them the terms I have the honour to tran&s;mit to you. The inhabitants of the country came in to us fa&s;t, bring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in their arms, and taking the oaths of fidelity, until a general peace determines their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I have the honour to inclo&s;e herewith a li&s;t of the killed and wounded; a li&s;t of the pri&s;oners as perfect as I have yet been able
<PB N="218" REF="255">
to get it; and a li&s;t of the artillery and &s;tores in the town as well as tho&s;e fallen into our hands at <HI>Beauport</HI> in con&s;equence of the vic|tory. By de&s;erters we learn, that the enemy are re-a&s;&s;embling what troops they can, behind the <HI>Cape Rouge;</HI> that M. <HI>de Levy</HI> is come down from the <HI>Montreal</HI> &s;ide to command them; &s;ome &s;ay, he has brought two battalions with him; if &s;o, this blow has already a&s;&s;i&s;ted General <HI>Amher&s;t.</HI> By other de&s;erters, we learn, that M. <HI>de Bougainville,</HI> with 800 men, and provi&s;ions, was on his march to fling him&s;elf into the town the 18th, the very morn|ing it capitulated, on which day we had not compleated the in|ve&s;titure of the place, as they had broke their bridge of boats, and had detachments in very &s;trong works on the other &s;ide the river <HI>St. Charles.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould not do ju&s;tice to the Admiral, and the naval &s;ervice, if I neglected this occa&s;ion of acknowledging how much we are indebted for our &s;ucce&s;s to the con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport re|ceived from there, and the perfect harmony and corre&s;pondence, which has prevailed throughout all our operations, in the uncom|mon difficulties, which the nature of this country, in particular, pre&s;ents to military operations of a great extent, and which no army can it&s;elf &s;olely &s;upply; the immen&s;e labour in artillery, &s;tores and provi&s;ions; the long watchings and attendance in boats; the drawing up our artillery by the &s;eamen even in the heat of action; it is my duty, &s;hort as my command has been, to ac|knowledge, for that time, how great a &s;hare the navy has had in this &s;ucce&s;sful campaign.</P>

The army took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gates on the land &s;ide the &s;ame evening, and &s;ent &s;afe guards into the town to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;erve order, and to prevent any th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng from being de&s;troyed; and Capt. <HI>Palli&s;er,</HI> with a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy of &s;eamen, landed in the lower town, and did the &s;ame. The next day our army marched in, and near a thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> officers,
<PB N="219" REF="257">
&s;oldiers and &s;eamen, were embarked on board &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> catts, who &s;hall &s;oon proceed for <HI>France,</HI> agreeable to the capitulation.</P>
<P>I had the honour to write to you the 5th in&s;t by the <HI>Rodney</HI> cutter. The troops, mentioned in that letter, imbarked on board the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els above the town, in the night of the 6th in&s;t. and at four in the morning of the 13th began to land on the north &s;hore, about a mile and a half above the town. General <HI>Montcalm</HI> with his whole army, left their camp at <HI>Beauport,</HI> and marched to meet him. A little before ten both armies were form|ed, and the enemy began the attack. Our troops received their fire, and re&s;erved their own, advancing till they were &s;o near as to run in upon them, and pu&s;h them with their bayonets; by which, in a very little time, the <HI>French</HI> gave way, and fled to the town in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and with great lo&s;s; for our troops pur&s;ued them quite to the walls, and killed many of them upon the glacis, and in the ditch; and if the town had been further off the whole <HI>French</HI> army mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed. About 250 <HI>French</HI> pri&s;oners were taken that day, among whom are ten captains, and &s;ix &s;ubaltern officers, all of whom will go in the great &s;hips to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry to acquaint you, that General <HI>Wolfe</HI> was killed in the action; and General <HI>Monckton</HI> &s;hot through the body; but he is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be out of danger. General <HI>Montcalm,</HI> and the three next <HI>French</HI> officers in command, were killed; but I mu&s;t refer you to General <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> (who writes by this opportunity) for the particulars of this action, the &s;tate of the garri&s;on, and the mea&s;ures he is taking for keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. I am now beginning to &s;end on &s;hore the &s;tores they will want, and provi&s;ions for five thou&s;and men; of which I can furni&s;h them with a &s;ufficient quantity.</P>
<P>The night of their landing, Admiral <HI>Holmes,</HI> with the &s;hips and troops, was about three leagues above the intended landing place: General <HI>Wolfe,</HI> with about half his troops, &s;et off in boats, and dropped down with the tide, and were by that means, le&s;s liable to be di&s;covered by the <HI>French</HI> centinels, po&s;ted all along the coa&s;t. The &s;hips followed them about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and got to the landing place ju&s;t in the time that had been concerted, to cover their landing; and con&s;i|dering the darkne&s;s of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation and very properly and &s;ucce&s;s|fully
<PB N="220" REF="258">
conducted. When General <HI>Wolfe,</HI> and the troops with him, had landed, the difficulty of gaining the top of the hill is &s;carce credible: it was very &s;teep in its a&s;cent, and high, and no path where two could go a-brea&s;t: but they were obliged to pull them|&s;elves up by the &s;tumps and boughs of trees, that covered the declivity.</P>
<P>Immediately after our victory over their troops, I &s;ent up all the boats in the fleet with artillery, and ammunition; and on the 17th went up with the men of war in a di&s;po&s;ition to attack the lower town, as &s;oon as General <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> &s;hould be ready to attack the upper; but in the evening they &s;ent out to the camp and offered terms of capitulation.</P>
<P>I have the farther plea&s;ure of acquainting you, that during this tedious campaign there has continued a perfect good un|der&s;tanding between the army and the navy. I have received great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Admirals <HI>Durell</HI> and <HI>Holmes,</HI> and from all the captains: Indeed every body has exerted them&s;elves in the execu|tion of their duty; even the tran&s;ports have willingly a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with boats and people on the landing the troops, and many other &s;ervices.</P>

All the di&s;po&s;itions to that daring but judicious attempt, near Silery, which at la&s;t drew Montcalm from his en|trenchments, were &s;o many ma&s;ter-pieces in the art of war.
<PB N="220" REF="258">
But it is certain, that the&s;e things, notwith&s;tanding the ex|traordinary abilities of the general, could never have been compa&s;&s;ed, had not the marine co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">operated with an unani|mity, diligence, and &s;kill, which never could have taken place, but from that perfect love to their country, that ani|mated all tho&s;e that were concerned in this expedition. Here was no murmuring nor di&s;content, nor ab&s;urd jealou|&s;y; no mean competition between the land and &s;ea-&s;ervice; but the mo&s;t zealous endeavours to &s;econd each others ef|forts, and the mo&s;t generous inclinations on each &s;ide, to give a due prai&s;e to their mutual &s;ervices.</P>
<P>When the news of this deci&s;ive action arrived in England, we all remember, though it is very difficult to de&s;cribe, the various and mixed emotions with which every one was af|fected. But two days before this came, was received the expre&s;s which General Wolfe had &s;ent off after the affair of Montmorenci. When the general doubted, the public thought they had rea&s;on to de&s;pair. But whil&s;t this gloom was fre&s;h and in the mid&s;t of the general de&s;pondency; a &s;econd expre&s;s arrives, and brings all at once an account of
<PB N="221" REF="259">
the victory, the taking of Quebec, and the death of Gene|ral Wolfe. The effect of &s;o joyful news, immediately on &s;uch a dejection, and then the mixture of grief and pity, which attended the public congratulations and applau&s;es, was very &s;ingular and affecting. The &s;ort of mourning triumph, that manife&s;ted it&s;elf on that occa&s;ion, did equal honour to the memory of the General, and to the huma|nity of the nation.</P>
<P>A little circum&s;tance was talked of at that time, and it de|&s;erves to be recorded, as it &s;hews a firmne&s;s of &s;entiment, and a ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking, in the lower kind of people, that is rarely met with even among&s;t per&s;ons of education. The mother of General Wolfe was an object marked out for pity by great and peculiar di&s;tre&s;s; the public wound pierced her mind with a particular affliction, who had ex|perienced the dutiful &s;on, the amiable dome&s;tic character, whil&s;t the world admired the accompli&s;hed officer. Within a few months &s;he had lo&s;t her hu&s;band; &s;he now lo&s;t this &s;on, her only child. The populace of the village where &s;he lived unanimou&s;ly agreed to admit no illuminations or firings, or any other &s;ign of rejoicing what&s;oever near her hou&s;e, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem by an ill-timed triumph, to in&s;ult over her grief. There was a ju&s;tne&s;s in this, and who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver knows the people, knows that they made no &s;mall &s;acrifice on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, which never &s;uffers any public &s;ervice to pa&s;s unrew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded, proceeded to honour the merits of the living and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the dead. The mini&s;ter him&s;elf made the motion for this purpo&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons, and all the force of eloquence was di&s;played in &s;etting off the&s;e &s;ervices in their proper light. A magnificent monument was voted for the decea&s;ed General in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; the living Generals and Admirals received the greate&s;t of honours, the thanks of their country, by their repre&s;en|tatives.</P>
<P>It is not known with certainty in what manner the French di&s;po&s;ed of the remainder of their army after the battle of Quebec. It is probable that they retired towards Montreal and Trois Rivieres, the only places of any con|&s;equence which they had left in Canada. In order to de|prive them of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in any attempt they might be in|duced to make towards the recovery of Quebec in the winter, the country along the river was laid wa&s;te for a
<PB N="222" REF="260">
very con&s;iderable extent. A mea&s;ure, which for the &s;ake of humanity, we could have wi&s;hed not to have been found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the operations were thus &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on in the river St. Laurence, General Amher&s;t was not want|ing in his endeavours on the &s;ide of Lake Champlain. Though the retreat of the French from Crown Point and Ticonderoga had left him entirely ma&s;ter of Lake George, he found that the command of Lake Champlain was &s;till an object of &s;ome difficulty. Mr. Bourlemaque, who com|manded in that part, had retired to the I&s;le de Noix, at the bottom of the lake, where he had three thou&s;and five hundred men &s;trongly entrenched; he had likewi&s;e four &s;tout armed &s;loops, by which he could ea&s;ily defeat any attempts by boats.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t found it nece&s;&s;ary to attain a naval &s;u|periority upon the Champlain, before he could hope to pu&s;h his operations any further; but this was a work of &s;o much time, that it made it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to attain the great end of the campaign, the communication with Ge|neral Wolfe, who was left in the manner we have &s;een to the exertion of his &s;ingle &s;trength. The naval preparations were not perfectly accompli&s;hed before the 10th of Octo|ber. They con&s;i&s;ted of a great radeau, eighty four feet in length, and twenty in breadth, which carried &s;ix twenty-four pounders; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of a brigantine and a &s;loop.</P>
<P>Covered by the&s;e the army was embarked in boats in a mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;ition, and proceeded a con&s;i|derable way up the lake;

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 11."> 

 but as the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, and the weather growing cold and tempe&s;tuous, he judged it highly dangerous to venture his troops much upon the water in open batteaux; for the waves run as high on this lake as at &s;ea in an hard gale of wind. Be&s;ides, he could not hope at this advanced &s;ea&s;on to act at &s;uch a di&s;tance as the I&s;le de Noix with any effect; he therefore wi&s;ely po&s;tponed his operations on that &s;ide to another year, and contented him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with the efforts of his little marine, which exerted it&s;elf with great activity; they blocked up two of the enemies &s;trong|e&s;t ve&s;&s;els in a bay, but the French abandoned them in the night,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 15."> 

 and &s;unk them in a deep wa|ter, the crews making their e&s;cape; the&s;e they
<PB N="223" REF="261">
were in hopes to weigh up. The French appearing no where to oppo&s;e them, the armed &s;loops returned to Crown Point &s;oon after the troops,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 21."> 

 which were di&s;po&s;ed in winter quarters.</P>
<P>The memorable and vigorous campaign of 1759, which made full amends for the inactivity of the former, was thus happily clo&s;ed. By the taking of Niagara, Ticonderago, and above all, Quebec, the French, in the little remaining part of Canada, are inve&s;ted upon every &s;ide. The troops which they have under Mr. Levy at Montreal, and tho&s;e under Mr. Bourlemaque at I&s;le de Noix, can neither be recruited with men, nor properly &s;upplied with military &s;tores, all communication with France being cut off. So that in the opening of the next campaign, if they are at|tacked with vigour from the &s;ide of Quebec, whil&s;t Gene|ral Amher&s;t advances with his body by Lake Champlain, of which he has now the entire dominion, the re&s;i&s;tance will be no more than &s;ufficient to give reputation to the con|que&s;t; and it will depend more upon our own &s;entiments of convenience what part of North America we &s;hall leave to France, than to any efforts they may make in that part of the world; happy if our European &s;y&s;tem &s;hould &s;o far concur, as to leave us free to conclude a peace in America upon its own merits.</P>

<P>Prince Henry's march into Saxony. General Vehla defeated. King of Pru&s;&s;ia enters Saxony. Pru&s;&s;ians defeated at Maxen. Again defeated at Mei&s;&s;en. M. Daun occupies the camp at Pirna. Mun&s;ter &s;urrenders to the allies. Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick defeats the Duke of Wurtemburg at Fulda. March of the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick to Saxony.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE took notice, in the preceeding part of our narra|tive, of that movement of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by which he got between the Ru&s;&s;ians and Great Glogau, and thereby baffled their de&s;ign upon that important place. This movement, at once daring, prudent and nece&s;&s;ary, hindered the Ru&s;&s;ians from taking winter quarters in his dominions; but at the &s;ame time it unavoidably cut off all communica|tion with the army of Prince Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="262">That Prince, &s;eeing that he could not &s;econd the opera|tions of the King, his brother, on the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, con|trived another expedient of co-operating with him, which was immediately to direct his march towards Saxony. There was no object, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which was more intere&s;ting; on that account it was very proper; but this march an&s;wered al&s;o another end; for it drew the attention of M. Daun to the &s;ide of Saxony, and di&s;abled him from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the de&s;igns of the Ru&s;&s;ians again&s;t Glogau, either with his whole army, or with any con&s;iderable de|tachment from it. The whole country of Lu&s;atia, through which this projected march lay, was in a manner over&s;pread with the enemy. M. Daun, with the main army of the Au&s;trians, lay at a place called Sorau, oppo&s;ite to the prince's camp. Five bodies of Ru&s;&s;ians occupied as many advanta|geous po&s;ts between the Bober and the Nei&s;s. General Laudohn po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole country along the Spree, with &s;everal Au&s;trian corps. To get round M. Daun, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a va&s;t circuit, and to march between the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian armies for more than &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>Before the prince entered upon this arduous de&s;ign, by &s;everal bold movements he obliged M. Daun to retreat from Sorau to Gorlitz, and from Gorlitz as far as Bautzen, keeping him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible between the prince and Saxony. But his Royal Highne&s;s having perceived the direction in which M. Daun was moving, made a com|pa&s;s to the northward of the Au&s;trians, into the Lower Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ed the Nei&s;s at Rothenburg, and marching with the utmo&s;t expedition arrived at Hoyers Werda in two days from his leaving his po&s;ts near Zittau.

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 25."> 

 This rapid march brought them quite unexpected upon a body of five or &s;ix thou&s;and Au&s;trian irregulars, commanded by General Vehla, who were &s;itu|ated in all &s;ecurity behind the town. They were routed with no &s;mall &s;laughter. Having di&s;lodged this corps, the prince's army had lei&s;ure to repo&s;e them&s;elves after &s;uch a fatiguing march, for two days; and then continued their progre&s;s towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">be, which river they cro&s;&s;ed at Torgau,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 2."> 

 having received notice that M. Daun had cro&s;&s;ed it before them near Dre&s;den. Thus was the grand theatre of the war once more trans|ferred into Saxony, and that mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> country, continually
<PB N="225" REF="263">
harra&s;ed, continually to&s;&s;ed from hand to hand, the &s;port of violence and fortune, &s;uffered equal di&s;tre&s;&s;es from its deliverers and its enemies.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian army, from the beginning of this war, has been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for its marches; and there is certainly nothing in all the various operations of war, which more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hes good troops, and able and &s;pirited leaders. But this march of prince Henry over &s;uch a tract of country, almo&s;t every where occupied by the enemy, in &s;o &s;hort a time, and with &s;o little lo&s;s, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t extraordinary, and the be&s;t con|ducted, of the marches, that have been made by the Pru&s;|&s;ian, or any other army.</P>
<P>This fortunate &s;troke, together with the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ians, afforded &s;ome hope, that notwith&s;tanding his re|peated di&s;a&s;ters, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might &s;till conclude the campaign to his advantage. The detachments under Finck and Wun&s;ch had no &s;ooner entered Mi&s;nia, than they attained a &s;uperiority over the united armies of Au|&s;tria and the Empire; all the places which in &s;o &s;hort a time they had &s;eized, in as &s;hort a time were reduced to the obedience of their former ma&s;ters. Wun&s;ch had en|gaged their army, and defeated one of its wings. This victory gave them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing to the gates of Dre&s;den, the only town which remained to the enemy of all tho&s;e they had taken. They found them&s;elves unable to prevent prince Henry from pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe; they found them&s;elves unable to prevent General Hul&s;en from coming to his relief with a con&s;iderable detachment; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound them&s;elves unable to prevent the King from joining him&s;elf to tho&s;e; when,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 12."> 

 after obliging the Ru&s;&s;ians to evacuate Sil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ia, he marched to their relief, leaving General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tzenplitz, with a part of his army, to keep the Ru&s;&s;ians from availing them&s;elves of his ab&s;ence. On this the army of the empire retired. M. Dawn fell back towards Dre&s;den. All the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's po&s;ts were left unmole&s;ted, and after all his lo&s;&s;es, and all his ne|ce&s;&s;ary detachments, he &s;till &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of a gallant army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, in high &s;pirits, and ready to execute the mo&s;t de&s;perate of his orders, notwith|&s;tanding the advanced &s;ea&s;on, and the great extremity of the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="264">It is true, that M. Daun was &s;uperior to him in num|bers, and yet more &s;o in &s;ituation. He could at any time take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the famous camp at Pirna, where he could not be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; but then the freezing of the Elbe, the &s;now on the mountains which divide Bohemia from Saxony, and the continual mo|le&s;tations which might be expected from the Pru&s;&s;ian par|ties, made this &s;ituation as dangerous, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as it was de&s;irable in others.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of many, that the&s;e advantages on the &s;ide of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, well pur&s;ued without aim|ing at more, would in a &s;hort time infallibly have obliged M. Daun to relinqui&s;h his &s;trong po&s;t, and to retire into Bohemia, abandoning Dre&s;den, and with it all the fruits of his victorious campaign. But the King, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an idea of the ill &s;ituation of the Au&s;trians, thought that advantages of greater moment, and more deci&s;ive, might he drawn from it. He knew, that the pa&s;&s;es into Bohemia were &s;o difficult, that by &s;ome po&s;ts properly cho&s;en and &s;trongly guarded, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Au&s;trians might be made impracticable, and even their retreat rendered &s;o difficult, that M. Daun would find him&s;elf compelled to fight at a di&s;advantage, and to put to the hazard of the field, all that his caution and prudence had been &s;o long and &s;o painfully procuring.</P>
<P>Upon this plan the King, having obliged M. Daun to retreat as far as Plauen, advanced him&s;elf as far as Ke&s;&s;el|dorf; and ordered General Finck, with a &s;trong corps, to turn the Au&s;trians, and &s;eize the defiles of Maxen and Ot|tendorf, through which alone it &s;eemed po&s;&s;ible for the Au&s;trians to communicate with Bohemia. This was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully executed, that there appeared no doubt that the King had effectually &s;ecured one of his principal ob|jects, and had placed Daun between two fires.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians enjoyed this &s;ecurity, M. Daun, who was aware of their de&s;ign, had &s;o occupied all the eminences about this rough and dangerous place, and all the pa&s;&s;es into it, that the Pru&s;&s;ians were hardly attacked, when their defeat &s;eemed inevitable. It is probable that they had got too far into the&s;e defiles, and had not taken proper mea&s;ures to &s;ecure a retreat, or any &s;ort of com|munication with the grand army. They became too late &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, and they made, for a whole day,
<PB N="227" REF="265">
the mo&s;t intrepid efforts to di&s;engage them&s;elves from it; but they were foiled in every attempt, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s of men, and of the mo&s;t part of their artillery.</P>
<P>Night put a &s;top to the engagement; the Au&s;trians em|ployed it effectually, to entangle the Pru&s;&s;ians, by guarding with double &s;trength and vigilance, every avenue through which it was po&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape. So that when the morning appeared,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 26."> 

 they &s;aw the hills covered upon every &s;ide with great bodies of their enemies, and every defile pre&s;ented a wall of bayonets, through which it was impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate. Thus galled with the lo&s;&s;es of the preceding day, in which it is &s;aid they had exhau&s;ted almo&s;t all their ammunition, &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of their cannon, &s;urrounded by the enemy on all quarters, no re&s;ource, no pro&s;pect of re|lief appearing, the army lo&s;t all hope, and all &s;pirit. To make any efforts in this condition, General Finck thought would only be to throw away unprofitably the lives of many brave men, which might be re&s;erved for a more hopeful occa&s;ion; he therefore, notwith&s;tanding the known rigour of his ma&s;ter, the apparent &s;hame of the thing, and the thou&s;and circum&s;tances of embarra&s;&s;ment that mu&s;t have ari&s;en to a man of honour at &s;uch a juncture, came to a re&s;olution of &s;urrendering the whole army pri&s;oners of war. Nineteen battalions and thirty five &s;quadrons, compo&s;ing near twenty thou&s;and men by the Au&s;trian account, above twelve by the Pru&s;&s;ian confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ixty-four pieces of cannon, many &s;tandards and colours were taken on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was unque&s;tionably the greate&s;t blow which the Pru&s;|&s;ians had felt from the beginning of the war; con&s;idering the critical time, the numbers taken, and the lo&s;s of repu|tation, which aro&s;e from the manner in which they were taken. It is no wonder, that &s;uch an extraordinary advan|tage, thus cheaply obtained, &s;hould greatly have elevated the friends of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. They had put the cheat upon the Pru&s;&s;ians, they had caught their enemy in the very trap which they had laid, as they thought, with &s;uch addre&s;s for them. They had now received a full in|demnification for the capture of the Saxon army, which had &s;urrendered in much the &s;ame manner, and very near this place, in the year 1756.</P>

 but on the approach of a large body of Au|&s;trians, they prepared to retreat over the river into that place into which they thought their retreat &s;ecure; but having been obliged by an hard fro&s;t to withdraw their bridge of boats, a thaw &s;upervening, when they attempted to lay a bridge of pontoons, &s;o many great fragments of ice floated in the river, that they found it impracticable; they were therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing over their army in boats. Whil&s;t they &s;truggled wirh the&s;e difficul|ties, their rear guard was attacked by the Au&s;trians with great fury, and all the men that compo&s;ed it, together with the General, were killed or made pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians on this occa&s;ions is &s;aid to have been three thou&s;and killed and taken; and this &s;econd &s;urprize brought a new di&s;credit, as well as a great detriment to the Pru&s;&s;ian arms.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not &s;o carried away with this flood of &s;uc|ce&s;s, as to depart in the lea&s;t degree from his u&s;ual cauti|ous management. Two advantages were now obtained, which, with a very few efforts, might be improved, to the entire de&s;truction of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. At lea&s;t, many Generals would have thought &s;o; but M. Daun thought that the &s;ame conduct, which, with no ri&s;que, and with little lo&s;s, had reduced the King &s;o low, was the mo&s;t likely, if pur&s;ued, to bring on his entire ruin. He re&s;olved to give that monarch no &s;ort of chance to recover his fortune; Daun, after the two great victories he had him&s;elf newly obtained, retired behind Dre&s;den; and as if he had been beaten, as often as he was victorious, he took refuge in the impregnable camp at Pirna, having &s;o di&s;po&s;ed matters, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, now to weak to &s;end out any great detachments, could not prevent his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia carried on his un&s;ucce&s;sful campaign in Saxony, through all the rigours of the &s;evere&s;t winter for many years felt in Europe; the army of the al|lies kept the field with better fortune. It is true, things had been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed by the ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of Mun&s;ter,
<PB N="229" REF="267">
and the reinforcements which arrived in the French army, that Prince Ferdinand did not find him&s;elf in a condition to force them to a deci&s;ive action; and therefore the &s;itu|ation of the two armies had continued much the &s;ame for a con&s;iderable time. At length Mun&s;ter, after a &s;eries of operations, &s;ometimes a &s;iege, &s;ometimes a block|ade, now broken off, and now re&s;umed,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 20."> 

 at la&s;t &s;urrendered, and the garri&s;on capitulated for their liberty.</P>
<P>Not long after this, the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, all who&s;e enterpri&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed with a peculiar eclat and &s;plendor, that mark them for his own, performed a &s;er|vice that curbed the French, even more than the lo&s;s of Mun&s;ter. Prince Charles of Bevern was al&s;o engaged in this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Duke of Wurtemburg had renewed his treaty of &s;ub&s;idy with France, and having recruited and augmented his troops, he lay at Fulda, a great way to the right of the French army. The Hereditary Prince formed a de&s;ign to attack him at that di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 28th of November, taking a &s;mall, but well cho&s;en corps of hor&s;e and foot, and di&s;engaging them from their baggage, he arrived in two days at Fulda, where the Wurtemburgers enjoyed them&s;elves in full &s;ecurity. A <HI>feu de joye</HI> had been ordered for that day; the troops were all in their be&s;t cloaths; the Duke had invited all the ladies in the town to his table, and to a ball, which he intended to have given that very day; but the Hereditary prince di&s;|concerted their mea&s;ures, both of war and diver&s;ion. A large party of the Wurtemburg troops were po&s;ted in a plain before the town. The Hereditary Prince fell upon them unawares in their front and flank, and drove them into the town, into which he clo&s;ely pur&s;ued them. Here they made &s;ome appearance of maintaining their ground for &s;ome minutes, but they were &s;oon driven out on the other &s;ide, and hotly pur&s;ued by the Prince of Brun&s;wick; without the town they were met by Prince Charles of Be|vern, who had made a compa&s;s about the place, and at|tacked them vigorou&s;ly as &s;oon as they had got out of it. Four battalions made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and were all cut to pieces or made pri&s;oners; the re&s;t, with the Duke him&s;elf, covered by the re&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e battalions, made a &s;hift to e&s;cape. Above a thou&s;and pri&s;oners were made on this
<PB N="230" REF="268">
occa&s;ion; and the Prince returned to the camp of the allies, after having effectually di&s;abled this corps from performing any thing con&s;iderable; and this action was of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, as, by the di&s;po&s;ition of that corps at Fulda, there was an appearance as if the French meant to form a communication with the army of the Empire, for the mutual exten&s;ion and &s;ecurity of their winter quarters.</P>
<P>This enterpri&s;e was only the prelude to another, which promi&s;ed to be much more exten&s;ive in its con&s;equences. The &s;ea&s;on was now grown too &s;evere to &s;uffer the allies to pu&s;h any further the advantages they had obtained over the French; at the &s;ame time it di&s;abled the French from attempting any thing con&s;iderable again&s;t them. Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages of the &s;ea&s;on, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Mun&s;ter, the allies were no longer obliged to keep &s;o large a body of men in We&s;tphalia. The&s;e were the con&s;iderations which &s;uf|fered Prince Ferdinand to turn his eyes to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs. After the two great blows which that monarch had &s;uffered, there was no hope of di&s;lodging M. Daun with his &s;ingle force; and he was utterly unable to avail him&s;elf as heretofore, of the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow. Prince Ferdinand, di&s;tant as he was from his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ally, and &s;o near to an enemy &s;uperior in numbers, did not he&s;itate to &s;end him &s;uccours, to enable him, if po&s;&s;ible, to make a final effort. He detached therefore 12,000 of his be&s;t men, and placed them under the command of the Hereditary Prince, with who&s;e vigour and diligence he was perfectly acquainted, and under whom he knew the &s;oldiers would endure any hard&s;hip with chearfulne&s;s. They marched from Kor&s;dorff,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 11."> 

 and in the depth of the late &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, without lo&s;ing a man by &s;ickne&s;s or de&s;ertion, in fifteen days, marched near three hundred miles, and join|ed the King of Pru&s;&s;ia at Freybourg.</P>
<P>This junction rai&s;ed for a while the &s;pirits and hopes of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, but, in effect, it did more honour to the abilities of the Hereditary Prince, than &s;ervice to the King. The &s;ea&s;on which fought equally again&s;t all &s;ides, the inacce&s;&s;ible camp at Pirna, and the caution of M. Daun, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the King, notwith&s;tanding this re|inforcement, to make any attempt. So that after &s;everal movements in hopes of bringing the Au&s;trians to an en|gagement, he was obliged at length to de&s;i&s;t, and to &s;uffer
<PB N="231" REF="269">
the &s;hattered remains of his army to repo&s;e in winter quar|ters, after the fruitle&s;s fatigues of &s;o long, &s;o laborious, and &s;o bloody a campaign.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia did not derive the benefits that were expected from this detachment; the French had no &s;ooner notice of it, than they attempted to avail them|&s;elves of the weakne&s;s it cau&s;ed in the allied army. The Duke of Broglio was now at the head of the French troops; he had lately returned from Ver&s;ailles, having ruined the character of M. de Contades, e&s;tabli&s;hed his own, remov|ed his rival, and, in &s;pight of &s;eniority, had acquired the mar&s;hal's &s;taff, and the command of the army. He thought he had now an opportunity for an action of eclat to di&s;tin|gui&s;h his entrence into command. He attempted to attack Prince Ferdinand by &s;urpri&s;e. But finding him perfectly prepared,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 24."> 

 and all his po&s;ts well guarded, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to retire to his former quarters; and with this abortive attempt clo&s;ed the ope|rations of the German campaign, from whence France had entertained &s;uch &s;anguine hopes; leaving to Prince Ferdi|nand the glory of taking Mun&s;ter in the pre&s;ence of one of their armies, and of &s;ecuring his own po&s;ts again&s;t all their efforts, after he had, from an inferior number, detached 12,000 men three hundred miles from his camp.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;everity of the winter could not put a &s;top to the operations of the land armies; it had no more effect upon the operations at &s;ea, which went on with vigour, in &s;pight of the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. The inva&s;ion projected by France, which the engagement off Cape Lagos had retarded, was by no means laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The preparations for a naval equipment in the har|bour of Bre&s;t, and for tran&s;porting a body of forces from
<PB N="232" REF="270">
Vannes, went on continually. The winter did not delay the&s;e preparations, becau&s;e it was hoped that in that &s;ea&s;on, the Briti&s;h fleet might be obliged to take refuge in their own harbours; and thus might afford an opportunity for the French fleet to come out unoppo&s;ed, and to execute the object of their de&s;tination before the Briti&s;h navy could be in readine&s;s to encounter them.</P>
<P>In fact, they were not wholly di&s;appointed in their ex|pectations. A violent &s;torm forced Sir Edward Hawke to quit his &s;tation off Bre&s;t. He came with his whole fleet to anchor in Torbay.</P>
<P>The French fleet availed it&s;elf of his ab&s;ence to put to &s;ea.

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 14."> 

 The whole Engli&s;h nation was alarmed; but it was an alarm which produced no hurry or di&s;turbance, but vigorous, cool, and &s;ettled methods for defence.</P>
<P>And now the event of the whole war was put to the i&s;&s;ue; for upon the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;troke every thing depended. Admiral Hawke lo&s;t not a moment's time to put again to &s;ea,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 14."> 

 and to &s;eek the French fleet. Both &s;quadrons put to &s;ea on the &s;ame day; Sir Edward Hawke from Torbay, M. de Conflans from Bre&s;t. There was a difference of but one &s;hip of the line in their forces.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible here to pa&s;s over the gallant behaviour of one of our Admirals, as it helps to mark the genius and &s;pi|rip of this happy time, and as this is one of the fine&s;t in&s;tan|ces of it. Admiral Saunders came into port from his Que|bec expedition immediately after Hawke had &s;ailed. After &s;uch a long voyage and &s;o &s;evere a campaign, unbroken by fatigue, and &s;till in&s;atiated with glory, he determined im|mediately to &s;et &s;ail again, and partake the honour and danger of the coming engagement. For this purpo&s;e no time was to be lo&s;t, and he had no orders. But he thought the exigencies of his country &s;ufficient orders; and he knew that at this time the letter of military di&s;cipline would never be &s;et again&s;t its &s;pirit. He therefore &s;et &s;ail without waiting for orders with ten &s;hips; but fortune did not fa|vour the genero&s;ity of his intentions, and he did not join the Briti&s;h fleet time enough for the engagement.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward Hawke concluded that the fir&s;t rendez|vous of the enemy's fleet would be at Quiberon, he direct|ed his cour&s;e with all diligence for that bay. But here
<PB N="233" REF="271">
again fortune for a while &s;eemed to declare for the French; for a &s;trong wind blown in an ea&s;terly point, drove the En|gli&s;h fleet a great way to the we&s;tward; but at length it became more favourable, and bore them in directly to the &s;hore. About eight o'clock the headmo&s;t &s;hips di&s;covered the enemy bearing to the northward, between the i&s;land of Bellei&s;le and the main land of France.</P>
<P>Hawke &s;aw at la&s;t what he had &s;o long, and &s;o ardently wi&s;hed for, (though hitherto in vain) the enemy in his reach. But yet there were &s;uch difficulties in his way, as would have checked a very cautious commander, or per|haps any commander in circum&s;tances le&s;s critical to the public &s;afety. On the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;pection of the chart it will appear, that all this &s;ea is &s;own thick with &s;ands and &s;hoals, and &s;hallows, and rocks; our pilots were by no means well acquainted with it; and the wind blew little le&s;s than a violent &s;torm, and the waves ran mountain high. In the&s;e circum&s;tances they were to attack a very &s;trong &s;quadron of the enemy on their own coa&s;t, with which they were perfectly acquainted. All the&s;e difficul|ties only animated the Engli&s;h Admiral. In one of the fi|ne&s;t &s;hips in the world, commanding the flower of the Briti&s;h navy, and &s;econded by &s;ome of the mo&s;t tried and brave&s;t officers in the &s;ervice; and above all not dubious of him|&s;elf. He ordered the &s;hips neare&s;t the enemy immediately to cha&s;e, and, by engaging them, to give time for the re&s;t of the fleet to come up.</P>
<P>M. Conflans had two choices, either to fly, or to &s;tand and fight it out. But he followed neither perfectly; for &s;ome time he appeared as if he meant to fight; but after giving the Briti&s;h &s;hips time to come near him, when it was too late, he crouded all the &s;ail he could carry; at the &s;ame time he &s;hewed an attention to keep his &s;quadron toge|ther.</P>
<P>At half an hour after two, the action began with great fury. In two hours the enemy had lo&s;t three &s;hips of the line, one &s;truck, two were &s;unk outright. Hawke ordered his &s;hip to re&s;erve her fire, to pa&s;s by all the others, and to be laid along &s;ide of the Soleil Royal, the be&s;t &s;hip in the French navy, and commanded by M. de Conflans; the ma&s;ter remon&s;trated on the almo&s;t inevitable danger of the coa&s;t. Hawke an&s;wered,
<Q>You have done your duty in this re|mon&s;trance; now obey my orders, and lay me along
<PB N="234" REF="272">
&s;ide the French admiral.</Q>
A French &s;hip of 70 guns generou&s;ly put him&s;elf between them; Hawke was obliged to be&s;tow here the fire he had re&s;erved for a greater occa|&s;ion, and at one broad&s;ide &s;unk her to the bottom. The headmo&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;hips fired on the enemy as they came up to them, and then pa&s;&s;ed on to others, leaving tho&s;e behind to improve their &s;ucce&s;s, and de&s;troy or take them; and by this method they had got up quite to the van of the enemy, and would have totally de&s;troyed their fleet, had not night interpo&s;ed to &s;ave them. Before night came on, the enemy's fleet was much di&s;per&s;ed; but in the eagerne&s;s of the pur&s;uit, two of the Engli&s;h &s;hips unfortu|nately run upon a &s;and, called the Four, and were lo&s;t. The enemy fled in to their own coa&s;t. Seven &s;hips of the line threw overboard all their guns, and e&s;caped into the River Villaine; about as many more got out to &s;ea, and made for other ports.</P>
<P>Nothing could be conceived more dreadful than the night which &s;ucceeded this action. A violent &s;torm blew all night long. It was a pitchy darkne&s;s; a dangerous coa&s;t &s;ur|rounded them on almo&s;t all &s;ides. A continual firing of di&s;tre&s;s guns was heard, without knowing whether they came from friend or enemy; and on account of the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t and the darkne&s;s of the night, our people were equally unable to venture to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When morning came on, they found the French Admi|ral had run his &s;hip, and another called the Heros, on &s;hore; the fir&s;t was &s;et on fire by the enemy, the other by our &s;eamen. Thus concluded this remarkable action ^(^c^)

, in
<PB N="235" REF="273">
which the French had four capital &s;hips de&s;troyed, one ta|ken, and the whole of their formidable navy, in which con|&s;i&s;ted the la&s;t hope of their marine, &s;hattered, di&s;armed, and di&s;per&s;ed. The long threatned inva&s;ion which was
<PB N="236" REF="274">
to repair their lo&s;&s;es in every part of the world, was di&s;&s;i|pated, and the credit of their arms broken along with their forces. The behaviour of the Engli&s;h captains and &s;eamen,
<PB N="237" REF="275">
on the contrary, added as much to the glory of the Briti&s;h arms, as to the &s;afety of their country. Perhaps there ne|ver was a naval engagement of &s;uch extent, in which no
<PB N="238" REF="276">
captain was accu&s;ed, nor even in any degree &s;u&s;pected of mi&s;behaviour or cowardice; in which tho&s;e who engaged, and tho&s;e who did not, gave proofs that they were equally ardent in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>

<P>IN my letter of the 17th, by expre&s;s, I de&s;ired you would ac|quaint their lord&s;hips with my having received intelligence of 18 &s;ail of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine and three frigates of the <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> &s;quadron, being di&s;covered about 24 leagues to the N.

we cha&s;ed them, their &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted, according to the ac|companying li&s;t, of four &s;hips of 80, &s;ix of 74, three of 70, eight of 64, one frigate of 36, one of 34, and one of 16 guns, with a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to look out. They &s;ailed from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> the 24th in&s;t. the &s;ame day I &s;ailed from <HI>Toybay.</HI></P>
<P>Concluding that their fir&s;t rendevous &s;hould be <HI>Quiberon,</HI> the in&s;tant I received the intelligence, I directed my cour&s;e thither with a pre&s;t &s;ail. At the fir&s;t wind blowing hard, at S. by E. and S. drove us con&s;iderably to the we&s;tward. But on the 18th and 19th, though variable, it proved more favourable. In the mean time, having been joined by the <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI> frigates, I directed their commanders to keep a head of the &s;quadron: one on the &s;tarboard and the other on the larboard bow.

, the <HI>French Heros</HI> al&s;o, and the <HI>Soleil Royal,</HI> which under cover of the night had anchored among us, cut and run a&s;hore to the we&s;tward of <HI>Crozie.</HI> On the latter's moving, I made the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s &s;ignal to &s;lip and pur&s;ue her, but &s;he unfortunately got upon the <HI>Four,</HI> and both &s;he and the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> are irrecoverably lo&s;t, notwith&s;tanding we &s;ent them all the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance that the weather would permit. About four&s;core of the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI>'s company, in &s;pite of the &s;tronge&s;t remon&s;trahces of their captain, made rafts, and, with &s;everal <HI>French</HI> pri&s;oners be|longing to the <HI>Formidable,</HI> put off, and I am afraid, drove out to &s;ea. All the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s are &s;aved (with as many of the &s;tores as po&s;|&s;ible) except one lieutenant and a boat's crew, who were drove on the <HI>French</HI> &s;hore, and have not been heard of: the remains of both &s;hips have been &s;et on fire. We found the <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire, Re|venge,</HI> and <HI>Defiance,</HI> in the night of the 20th put out to &s;ea; as I hope the <HI>Swift&s;ure</HI> did, for &s;he is &s;till mi&s;&s;ing. The <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Defiance</HI> returned next day, and the latter &s;aw the <HI>Revenge</HI> without. Thus, what lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained has been owing to the weather not the enemy, &s;even or eight of who&s;e line of battle &s;hips got to &s;ea, I believe, the night of the action.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was broad day-light in the morning of the 21&s;t, I di&s;covered &s;even or eight of the enemy's line of battle &s;hips at anchor, between <HI>Point Penris,</HI> and the river <HI>Villaine;</HI> on which I made the &s;ignal to weigh, in order to work up and attack them; but it blowed &s;o hard from the N. W. that in&s;tead of daring to ca&s;t the &s;quadron loo&s;e, I was obliged to &s;trike top gallant ma&s;ts. 
<PB N="237" REF="275">
Mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;hips appeared to be a-ground at low water; but on the flood, by lightening them, and the advantage of the wind under the land, all except two got that night into the river <HI>Vil|laine.</HI></P>
<P>The weather being moderate on the 22d, I &s;ent the <HI>Portland, Chatham,</HI> and <HI>Vengeance</HI> to de&s;troy the <HI>Soleil Royal</HI> and <HI>Heros.</HI> The <HI>French,</HI> on the approach of our &s;hips, &s;et the fir&s;t on fire, and &s;oon after the latter met the &s;ame fate from our people. In the mean time I got under way, and worked up within <HI>Penris Point,</HI> as well for the &s;ake of its being a &s;afer road, as to de&s;troy, if po&s;&s;ible, the two &s;hips of the enemy which &s;till lay without the <HI>Villaine;</HI> but before the &s;hips I &s;ent a-head for that purpo&s;e could get near them, being quite light, and with the tide of flood, they got in.</P>
<P>All the 23d we were employed in reconnoitring the entrance of that river, which is very narrow, and only twelve feet water on the bar, at low water. We di&s;covered at lea&s;t &s;even, if not eight, line of battle &s;hips about half a mile within, quite light, and two large frigates moored acro&s;s, to defend the mouth of the river; only the frigates appeared to have guns in.</P>
<P>By evening I had twelve long boats fitted as fire-&s;hips, ready to attempt burning them, under convoy of the <HI>Saphire</HI> and <HI>Co|ventry;</HI> but the weather being bad, and the wind contrary, oblig|ed me to defer it, till at lea&s;t the latter &s;hould be favourable; if they can, by any means be de&s;troyed, it &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>In attacking a flying enemy, it was impo&s;&s;ible in the &s;pace of a &s;hort winter's day, that all our &s;hips &s;hould be able to get into ac|tion, or all tho&s;e of the enemy brought to it. The commanders and companies of &s;uch as did come up with the rear of the <HI>French,</HI> on the 20th, behaved with the greate&s;t intrepidity, and gave the &s;tronge&s;t proof of a true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;pirit. In the &s;ame manner I am &s;atisfied, would tho&s;e have acquitted them&s;elves, who&s;e bad go|ing &s;hips, or the di&s;tance they were at in the morning, prevented from getting up. Our lo&s;s by the enemy is not con&s;iderable; for in the &s;hips which are now with me, I find only one lieutenant, and 39 &s;eamen and marines killed, and about 202 wounded. When I con&s;ider the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the hard gales of wind on the day of action, a flying enemy, the &s;hortne&s;s of the day, and the coa&s;t we are on, I can boldly affirm, that all that po&s;&s;i|bly could be done, has been done. As to the lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;|tained, 
<PB N="238" REF="276">
let it be placed to the nece&s;&s;ity I was under of running all ri&s;ks to break this &s;trong force of the enemy: had we had but two hours more day-light, the whole had been totally de&s;troyed or taken, for we were almo&s;t up with their van when night overtook us.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday came in here the <HI>Pallas, Fortune</HI> &s;loop, and the <HI>Pro|&s;erpine</HI> fire-&s;hip. On the 16th I had di&s;patched the <HI>Fortune</HI> to <HI>Quebec,</HI> with directions to captain <HI>Duff,</HI> to keep directly on his guard. In his way thither he fell in with the <HI>Phebe,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> fri|gate of 40 guns, under jury-ma&s;ts, and fought her &s;everal hours. During the engagement lieutenant <HI>Stuart,</HI> 2d of the <HI>Ramilies,</HI> whom I had appointed to command her, was unfortunately killed; the &s;urviving officers, on con&s;ulting together, re&s;olved to leave her, as &s;he proved too &s;trong for them. I have detached captain <HI>Young</HI> to <HI>Quiberon</HI> bay with five &s;hips, and am making up a flying &s;quadron to &s;cour the coa&s;t to the i&s;le of <HI>Aix,</HI> and if practicable, to attempt any of the enemy's &s;hips that may be there.</P>

</FLOATEXT>

<P><PB N="239" REF="277">Tho&s;e who think &s;uch matters de&s;erving of their notice, have ob&s;erved, that this deci&s;ive naval engagement, the &s;urrender of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops at Maxen, and the taking of Mun&s;ter, happened on the &s;ame day, the 20th of No|vember.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="278">This was the conclu&s;ion of the French affairs in Europe. The i&s;&s;ue of the campaign in America had not been more favourable to them. Although the events in the Ea&s;t Indies belong properly to the la&s;t year, yet, as the accounts did not arrive until this, and that the actions there were of great importance, and equally fortunate on our &s;ide, it is proper that we &s;hould take &s;ome notice of them here.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="279">The Engli&s;h had by no means that &s;uperiority over the French in the Ea&s;t Indies, which they had in America. It was here the French &s;eemed to have made tho&s;e efforts, by which they hoped in &s;ome degree to ballance their lo&s;&s;es in other parts. They had a very &s;trong &s;quadron under M. d'Ache in tho&s;e &s;eas. M. de Lally, an officer of credit, and of greater rank than had u&s;ually been &s;ent on that &s;ervice, commanded a body of 2000 Europeans, a great army, in a country where the name of an European is it&s;elf a &s;trength.</P>
<P>In the beginning, their &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed proportioned to their forces; they took the fort and city of St. David's. But in a very &s;hort time the ill &s;tar of France, which in no part of the world &s;et well on their affairs, began to influ|ence them here. M. d'Ache, in two naval engagements, was wor&s;ted, and prevented from co-operating with the land forces for the re&s;t of the campaign. And had the &s;pirit and conduct of Admiral Pococke been as well &s;econded by &s;ome of his captains, as it was by others, there is great rea&s;on to believe, that the French naval power had been as effectually de&s;troyed in tho&s;e &s;eas, as it had been in tho&s;e of Europe.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e checks, it was nece&s;&s;ary that M. Lally &s;hould act. But it was not only the di&s;grace of the French fleet, but an extreme want of money which delayed his operations. A Prince of the country, the King of Tan|jour, appeared the only re&s;ource which was open. To this prince he applied for a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, which being ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, he carried the war into his dominions, and laid &s;iege to his capital city. But after lying &s;everal days before it, and after having even made a prac|ticable breach, the &s;kill of &s;ome Engli&s;h gunners, the want of provi&s;ions and ammunition, and the di&s;orders which reigned in his army, obliged him to return without the money, and with the mortification of being beaten from a place, only fortified after the Indian manner.</P>
<P>This failure in their pecuniary expectations, and their repul&s;e from an Indian town, were bad encouragements to the undertaking of an enterprize again&s;t an European ene|my, and a fortification in &s;ome degree regular. But having &s;eized upon a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, as it is thought much with its own con&s;ent, which contained a large trea&s;ure, they &s;et out at length to be&s;iege Madra&s;s. But here their &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="242" REF="280">
was no better than at Tanjour, though their &s;trength was greater, and their efforts much more ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Colonel Draper and Major Brereton defended the place with the utmo&s;t &s;kill and bravery. Mr. Pigot likewi&s;e with equal genero&s;ity and prudence, &s;econded their endeavours, by the &s;upplies of &s;tores and ammunition, which were ad|mirably di&s;tributed, and co-operated with the military with a firmne&s;s and intrepidity, by which he obtained an honour equal to any in the defence of the place. Whil&s;t the town was defended with great &s;pirit within; parties were con|tinually &s;ent out, which &s;o infe&s;ted the roads through which the enemy's convoys were to pa&s;s, that their army in the trenches were infinitely weakened by the detachments which they were obliged to &s;end out. After a &s;iege of more than two months, they were obliged to abandon their en|terprize, and by that means renounce for ever all tho&s;e &s;an|guine hopes, which they had entertained from the forces in this part of the world. The Engli&s;h, on the contrary, went on from &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ucce&s;s. Whil&s;t they defeated the French on the Ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the great penin&s;ula of India, on the we&s;tern they took the great and opulent city of Surat from the powers of the country, with very little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>General Lally left Madra&s;s in the utmo&s;t tran&s;ports of rage and de&s;pair, which a man of honour and ability in his profe&s;&s;ion can feel, who is ill &s;econded by his troops, neg|lected by tho&s;e who ought to &s;upport him, and cheated by the villainy of contractors, and of all tho&s;e who turn war into a low traffic. ^(^a^)

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Gen. Lally's Letter to M. de Lyrit, dated Madra&s;s, <DATE>the 14th of February, <HI>1759.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>A Good blow might be &s;truck here: There is a &s;hip in the road of 20 guns, laden with all the riches of Madra&s;s, which it is &s;aid will remain there till the 20th. The <HI>Expedition</HI> is ju&s;t arrived, but M. <HI>Gorlin</HI> is not a man to attack her: for &s;he has made him run away once before. The <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> on the other hand did but ju&s;t make her appearance before St. Thomas; and on the vague report of thirteen &s;hips coming from Porto Novo, &s;he took fright; and after landing the provi&s;ions with which &s;he was laden, &s;he would not &s;tay long enough even to take on board twelve of her own guns, which &s;he had lent us for the &s;iege.</P>
<PB N="243" REF="281">
<P>If I was the judge of the point of honour of the company's officers, I would break him like gla&s;s, as well as &s;ome others of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fidelle,</HI> or <HI>Harlem,</HI> or even the afore&s;aid <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with the twelve guns re&s;tored to her, would be &s;ufficient to make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip, if they could manage &s;o as to get to the windward of her in the night. <HI>Maugendie</HI> and <HI>Tremil|lier</HI> are &s;aid to be good men; and were they employed only to tran&s;port 200 wounded men, that we have here, their &s;ervice would be of importance.</P>
<P>We remain &s;till in the &s;ame po&s;ition: the breach made the&s;e fifteen days; all the time within fifteen toi&s;es of the wall of the place, and never holding up our heads to look at it.</P>

<P>Of 1500 <HI>Cipays</HI> which attend our army, I reckon near 800 are employed upon the road to <HI>Pondicherry,</HI> laden with &s;ugar, pepper, and other goods; and as for the <HI>Caulis</HI> they are all employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from the fir&s;t day we came here.</P>

<P><PB N="247" REF="285">However, the&s;e re&s;ources, &s;uch as they are, will enable them to keep the war on foot. They turn their whole at|tention to Germany, where they have very greatly aug|mented their army, and placed it under a general, from whom they have &s;ome hopes, after their repeated di&s;ap|pointments, and the frequent changes they have made. They propo&s;e al&s;o another army under the prince de Sou|bi&s;e; if they can compa&s;s this latter project, as it is believ|ed they may, the &s;y&s;tem of Germany is &s;till in very immi|nent danger. For notwith&s;tanding the tried goodne&s;s of our troops, and the admirable commander at the head of them, it is certain, even with any reinforcements we may be able to &s;end, we &s;hall find it very difficult to contend with two armies, &s;uppo&s;ing that we &s;hall have no other than French armies to contend with, and that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be able, as he has hitherto been, to find employment for the many, the powerful, and the implaca|ble enemies that &s;urround him.</P>
<P>It is certain he is much reduced; and that his re&s;ources are nearly exhau&s;ted. The&s;e are facts which cannot be concealed; and yet &s;ome glimmering of hopes may be &s;till perceived, when we con&s;ider the admirable talents for war and government, which that monarch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; and when we con&s;ider even the events of the la&s;t (to him) unfortunate campaign; where after having &s;uffered four capital defeats, and having obtained no one con&s;iderable advantage, he has yet continued in &s;ome &s;ort &s;uperior in the field; the enemy has not been able to make the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon his do|minions; and he has, at la&s;t, more than divided Saxony with them; the city of Dre&s;den is all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s in that country, and the acqui&s;ition of which has been the only fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f four campaigns, and four victories in one campaign, and the efforts of the united forces of Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, and the Empire, to &s;ay nothing of France and Sweden.</P>
<P>As for Great Britain, &s;he has only to fear from her con|nections. In no one year &s;ince &s;he was a nation, has &s;he been favoured with &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;es, both by &s;ea and land, and in every quarter of the globe; nor have her officers, both by &s;ea and land, ever done more honour to their coun|try, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir &s;kill and bravery. And with regard to the in|ternal admini&s;tration, it &s;uffices to &s;ay, that whil&s;t France became bankrupt, without delay or murmuring there have been more than &s;ix millions borrowed in England at a very

ea&s;y rate; and that the intere&s;t on this immen&s;e &s;um has been made good by a &s;ingle tax upon malt, which will &s;carce be felt by the people. By this the re&s;ources of England may be imagined; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that highly as we are taxed for the nece&s;&s;ary charges of the war; we have not been prevented from great and expen&s;ive vo|luntary exertions of public &s;pirit and beneficence. The cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and after their example other towns made a large &s;ub&s;cription for enli&s;ting &s;oldiers. Sub&s;criptions were al&s;o carried on to a great amount, for cloathing the enemies pri&s;oners, abandoned through the neglect or poverty of their &s;overeign; and for admini&s;ter|ing to the relief of the families of tho&s;e who had fallen in the battles of Quebec and Minden. Thus actuated by the warme&s;t patrioti&s;m, which far from extingui&s;hing, &s;eemed to kindle a beneficence towards our enemies in their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The condition of Europe, which all people thought would have been decided in this campaign, is nearly as du|bious as ever; and the difficulties which oppo&s;e them&s;elves to a peace are rather augmented than dimini&s;hed. Here then we clo&s;e the &s;cene, and conclude the events of the pre&s;ent year; in the next we hope, notwith&s;tanding appear|ances, after &s;o many &s;cenes of horror, to have the more plea&s;ing ta&s;k of relating the &s;teps taken to a general peace, on terms as particularly advantageous to our own country, as the mixed intere&s;ts of Europe, and the various fortunes of the powers embarked in the &s;ame cau&s;e, will admit.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANNUAL REGISTER: OR HISTORY OF THE WAR. For the YEAR 1760.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Nothing decided in the war. State of the &s;everal powers concerned. Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia propo&s;e an ac|commodation. Difficulties in concluding a peace. The condition and hopes of France. Demands on the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Treaty &s;aid to be between Ru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF all the wars which have harra&s;&s;ed Europe for more than a century had not proved it, the events of the la&s;t campaigns mu&s;t have &s;atisfied every thinking man, that victories do not decide the fate of nations. Four mo&s;t bloody, and to all appearance mo&s;t ruinous defeats, which he &s;uffered in that year, had de&s;poiled the King of Pru&s;&s;ia of no more than a &s;ingle town. After the&s;e accumu|lated blows he &s;till found him&s;elf in a condition to make good his winter-quarters; to cover his dominions; and to tempt the favour of fortune in another campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="290">To carry our attention a little further back; who could have imagined, that when the French had compelled the Hanoverian troops to lay down their arms, when they had thru&s;t them into a defencele&s;s corner, had bound them down with the yoke of a &s;trict and &s;evere capitulation, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of every place which could boa&s;t the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of &s;trength in the king's German dominions, that in a few months they &s;hould find them&s;elves compelled to fly before their captives; and after having &s;uffered a con&s;iderable defeat, &s;hould be pu&s;hed back almo&s;t on their own territories.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed that the effects of the&s;e advantages under the management of a very great commander, who was be&s;ides largely reinforced, could have been fru&s;trated only by the lo&s;s of &s;ome great battle. But the fact was otherwi&s;e. The Hanoverians, without any adver&s;e &s;troke in that campaign, were obliged to repa&s;s the Rhine and the Lippe; and &s;ince that time, fortune having decided nothing by the events of five years war, has given to Prince Ferdinand the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of We&s;tphalia in the manner of a conquered country, and yet &s;ees him abandoning He&s;&s;e, and with difficulty co|vering the borders of Hanover.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the victory of Crevelt could not enable the Duke of Brun&s;wick to defend the Rhine. The battle of Bergen did not give M. Broglio an entrance into Hanover. The great victory of Minden did not drive the French from the Maine. We have &s;een armies, after complete victory, obliged to act as if they had been defeated; and after a defeat, taking an offen&s;ive part with &s;ucce&s;s, and reaping all the fruits of victory.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are &s;till more &s;trongly enforced by the fortune of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Covered with the laurels of Lowo&s;itz, Prague, Ro&s;bach and Li&s;&s;a, when he began after &s;o many compleat triumphs, to pur&s;ue his advantages, and to improve &s;ucce&s;s into conque&s;t, the &s;cene was &s;ud|denly altered. As &s;oon as he attempted to penetrate with effect into the enemies country, without having &s;uffered any very &s;ignal blow, without any con&s;iderable mi&s;take committed upon his &s;ide, Fortune, who hath as it were at|tached her&s;elf to the defen&s;ive, immediately for&s;ook him. He was not able to take a &s;ingle place. And tho&s;e advanta|ges which at other times and &s;ituations, would have laid
<PB N="251" REF="291">
the foundation of la&s;ting empire, have in his ca&s;e only protracted a &s;evere de&s;tiny, which &s;ome think in the end inevitable; but which as many, as great, and as entire victories &s;ince obtained over his forces, have not been yet able to bring upon him.</P>
<P>The ballance of power, the pride of modern policy, and originally invented to pre&s;erve the general peace as well as freedom of Europe, has openly pre&s;erved its liberty. It has been the original of innumerable and fruitle&s;s wars. That political torture by which powers are to be enlarged or abridged, according to a &s;tandard, perhaps not very ac|curately imagined, ever has been, and it is to be feared will always continue a cau&s;e of infinite contention and blood&s;hed. The foreign amba&s;&s;adors con&s;tantly re&s;iding in all courts, the negotiations ince&s;&s;antly carrying on, &s;pread both confederacies and quarrels &s;o wide, that whenever ho&s;tilities commence, the theatre of war is always of a pro|digious extent. All parties in tho&s;e diffu&s;ive operations, have of nece&s;&s;ity their &s;trong and weak &s;ides. What they gain in one part is lo&s;t in another; and in conclu&s;ion, their affairs become &s;o ballanced, that all the powers concerned are certain to lo&s;e a great deal; the mo&s;t fortunate acquire little; and what they do acquire is never in any rea&s;onable proportion to charge and lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Frequent experience of this might prove one of the &s;tronge&s;t grounds for a la&s;ting peace in Europe. But that &s;pirit of intrigue, which is the political di&s;temper of the time, that anxious fore&s;ight which forms the character of all the pre&s;ent courts, prevent the &s;alutary effects which might re&s;ult from this experience. The&s;e modern treaties of peace, the fruits not of moderation but nece&s;&s;ity; tho&s;e engagements contracted when all the parties are wea|ried and none &s;atisfied, where none can properly be called conquerors or conquered, where after having &s;ought in vain to compel, they are content to over-reach them in the very moment they are formed, and from the very act of forming them, with the &s;eeds of new di&s;&s;entions, more implacable animo&s;ities, and more cruel wars. For if to for|ward the work of peace, any member in the&s;e alliances &s;hould acquire a ce&s;&s;ion of any importance in its favour, this afterwards becomes a ground for another alliance, and for new intrigues to deprive them of their acqui&s;ition. To &s;ettle the peace of Germany, Sile&s;ia was yielded in 1745
<PB N="252" REF="292">
to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and that ce&s;&s;ion gave occa&s;ion for the war of 1756.</P>
<P>The kings of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia cho&s;e the mo|ment of &s;ucce&s;s, to propo&s;e an accommodation; and they de&s;ired that the oppo&s;ite powers &s;hould concur with them in nominating &s;ome place for a congre&s;s. Some &s;poke of Leip&s;ic, as a means of indemnification to that unfortunate city; the States General would have given a town of theirs; King Stani&s;laus offered Nancy, his capital: but the time of peace was not yet come. The two kings made a di&s;play of moderation; and they had rea&s;on to think that if their pro|po&s;als &s;hould be accepted (which probably they did not then expect) they mu&s;t naturally take the lead in that negotiation, and mu&s;t give the whole a turn to their advantage. But the adver&s;e alliance unanimou&s;ly rejected their efforts, and the refu&s;al of &s;ome of its members was couched in terms &s;ufficiently haughty.</P>
<P>To &s;peak impartially, they could not at that time have accepted propo&s;itions for peace. France had &s;uffered in every quarter: in her pre&s;ent condition &s;he could &s;carcely look for every favourable terms. As they had now aban|doned in de&s;pair all attempts by &s;ea, and con&s;equently all efforts in North America and both the Indies, all their hopes were centered in Germany. Hitherto their fortune in that country had not been very encouraging. But &s;till, in that country lay their be&s;t and indeed their only pro&s;pect. The &s;trength and per&s;everance of the two empre&s;&s;es, the wa&s;ted condition of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the enormous ex|pence of the German war to England, which mu&s;t gradually exhau&s;t the re&s;ources of her credit, and with them the pa|tience of an incon&s;tant people, had in&s;pired with no &s;mall hope. All the&s;e con&s;iderations confirmed their re&s;olution of hearkening to no terms, until by acquiring &s;uperiority, or at lea&s;t an equality, they might be a&s;&s;ured of procuring &s;uch as were not very di&s;advantageous or humiliating.</P>
<P>The empre&s;s queen upon her part had a moral certainty, that &s;he could not procure, by a treaty propo&s;ed at &s;uch a juncture, tho&s;e objects for which &s;he had begun, and with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s in every fortune had carried on the war. In reality, her circum&s;tances then were, and they &s;till continue, very intricate and embarra&s;&s;ed. It was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould have allies of great power; but if they have done her great &s;ervices, they have formed high preten&s;ions; in|deed

&s;o high, that if &s;he and her allies cannot ab&s;olutely pre|&s;cribe the terms of peace, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould all be in any degree &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Her &s;ituation in this re&s;pect has pu&s;hed <HI>ad internecionem,</HI> the war between her and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Even the ce&s;&s;ion of all Sile&s;ia in her favour, cannot procure a peace for that monarch. The Ru&s;&s;ians will never let loo&s;e their hold of the ducal Pru&s;&s;ia; a country conquered by their own arms, a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which rendered the King mo&s;t formida|ble to them, and which is their &s;ole indemnification for what they have expended in a war entered into for other views than tho&s;e of glory, or even of revenge. It has been confidently a&s;&s;erted, that the empre&s;s queen of Hungary has actually guarantied the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country to its conquerors. This is indeed a very extraordinary &s;tep, and the fact is not &s;ufficiently authenticated. But the report is not altogether improbable. We may be &s;ure that if &s;uch a guarantee has been made, it has been entered into upon &s;ome reciprocal engagement of equal force, and for an ob|ject equally important.</P>
<P>Nothing but the la&s;t de&s;perate nece&s;&s;ity, nothing in &s;hort but being conquered in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, will ever induce the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to &s;ubmit to both the&s;e ce&s;&s;ions. By &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, be&s;ide being de&s;poiled of that con|que&s;t, which is the great glory of his reign, and con&s;titutes the firme&s;t &s;upport of his revenue, he will &s;ee his heredi|tary dominions curtailed of another province from whence he derives his royal title, and what makes it of infinitely great|er importance in his eyes, the be&s;t commercial part of his territories, and that only part of his territories, by which he could have hoped to become in any degree a maritime power.</P>
<P>But though it were po&s;&s;ible that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty could be brought to &s;ubmit to the&s;e humiliating terms, a great deal &s;till remains to be adju&s;ted. There are other de|mands, which though not &s;o high in their nature, nor &s;o &s;trongly enforced, are notwith&s;tanding con&s;iderable, and cannot, with any decency be totally neglected. What is the nature of the bargain between the Empre&s;s and the Se|nate of Sweden, has not yet been made publick. Be it what it will, this is probably the lea&s;t perplexing part of the whole.</P>
<P>But &s;ome indemnification for the King of Poland, on
<PB N="254" REF="294">
who&s;e dominions the greate&s;t calamities of the war have fallen, &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and on what principle can Au&s;tria ever expect an ally, if &s;he &s;hould &s;ecure all the benefits of the pacification to her&s;elf, and leave to her con|federates nothing but the &s;ufferings of a war in which they were involved purely in her quarrel?</P>
<P>This variety of demands, all to be &s;atisfied out of the do|minions of a &s;ingle Prince, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily perplex the work of peace with almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties. It ought not indeed to be concealed, that there are circum|&s;tances which &s;eem to lead to &s;ome &s;olution of this embar|ra&s;&s;ment. But if they are attentively concerned, they will, I believe, be rather found to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>Great Britain has had remarkable &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France at &s;ea, in America, and in the Indies. On the continent of Europe, her fortune is even at this day, tollerably ballanced: the two weak parts, therefore, in the oppo&s;ite alliances, (I &s;peak only with regard to the events of the pre&s;ent war) are France and Pru&s;&s;ia. As therefore France will expect &s;ome ce&s;&s;ions from Great Britain, it is rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be bought by &s;ome moderation of the rigorous terms which otherwi&s;e would have been impo&s;ed on Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>All the &s;acrifices to peace mu&s;t be made out of the ad|vantage acquired by Au&s;tria and Great Britain. But when Great Britain &s;hall have con&s;ented to &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions, to forward this great work, what return can the Empre&s;s Queen make, but an abatement of her demands upon Sile|&s;ia? That is, by giving up that grand, favourite, and in|deed to her &s;ole object, for which &s;he has brought upon her&s;elf a heavy war, di&s;gu&s;ted her antient and natural al|lies, and purcha&s;ed the aid of her natural enemy, at the price of places which the be&s;t blood of Europe has been &s;o often &s;hed to pre&s;erve in her family. To all who con&s;ider the character of that court, it will appear very plainly that &s;he will hazard almo&s;t any thing, and even ri&s;que tho&s;e con|&s;equences to which her imprudent alliance with France has expo&s;ed her, rather than accept a peace which mu&s;t deprive her of her hopes of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things are weighed, it will not appear won|derful that there have been &s;o few &s;erious overtures for peace; and that the longer the war continues, the greater difficulties &s;eem to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to any conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="295">The only hope that remains of any happy conclu&s;ion, is that &s;ome of the great members of the alliance, wearied and exhau&s;ted, will at length fly off, and thereby throw the re&s;t into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that a peace will be &s;uddenly huddled up; and all difficulties not removed, but forgotten, by not allowing time to weigh and &s;tudy what may be gained or lo&s;t. This mu&s;t produce a &s;y&s;tem of pacification, the na|ture of which it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee; becau&s;e it cannot be &s;aid upon which &s;ide this defection will begin; but prin|cipally becau&s;e the war &s;till continues, in the event of which, in &s;pight of all that can be conjectured from the &s;trength and pre&s;ent condition of the powers concerned, fortune will have &s;o large a &s;hare. But we may predict without ra&s;hne&s;s, that the fir&s;t overtures will be between Great Britain and France: for they never think of peace in Germany.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>State of the Engli&s;h garri&s;on at Quebec. De&s;igns of Mon&s;-Levi. Preparations for a &s;iege. French army marches from Montreal. Their &s;trength. Battle of Sillery. Gen. Murray defeated.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS was the po&s;ture of Europe at the clo&s;e of the campaign of 1759. And all thoughts of peace being entirely removed, the war was pro&s;ecuted in this part of the world with the utmo&s;t vigour as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on per|mitted them to recommence operations.</P>
<P>But in America, the &s;everity of winter was not able whol|ly to interrupt the progre&s;s of the war. Canada had been &s;uppo&s;ed conquered, by the taking of Quebec. Indeed without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to reduce that country; but &s;till a great deal remained to compleat the advantage to which the taking of Quebec had only given an opening. The French troops after their de|feat, had retired into the heart of their country. And the Engli&s;h navy having provided the town &s;ufficiently with military &s;tores and provi&s;ions, &s;et &s;ail, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould be overtaken by the fro&s;t. Ten battalions, two companies of the artillery, one of American wood-rangers, in all about 7000 men, formed the garri&s;on which was left
<PB N="256" REF="296">
in Quebec to command Canada during the winter, and to facilitate the entire reduction of that province in the en&s;uing campaign. They were under the orders of General Murray.</P>
<P>As the river St. Laurence is commonly &s;hut up by ice, for the greater part of the winter, all communication with Europe was cut off. The conquering army was therefore &s;ubject to be inve&s;ted in Quebec. The French command|er, M. Levi, was &s;en&s;ible of this advantage; and he &s;aw that it was the only re&s;ource by which he could have any chance of pre&s;erving Canada. He accordingly prepared to make u&s;e of this la&s;t, and only opportunity; and he was not without &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He knew that the fortifications of Quebec were weak and incomplete, without any kind of outwork; that the town was almo&s;t a general ruin, &s;ince the late &s;iege; and that the Engli&s;h garri&s;on had been much enfeebled, and greatly reduced in their numbers by the &s;curvy. He knew al&s;o, that by &s;ome misfortune, no provi&s;ion had been made to prevent his attaining a &s;uperiority on the river; as no ve&s;&s;els had been left, on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they could not be u&s;eful in winter.</P>
<P>The winter had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;kirmi&s;hes always terminating in favour of the Engli&s;h, by which they enlarged the &s;phere of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. M. Levi had indeed propo&s;ed, during the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, to attempt the place by a coup de main; and had made preparations for that purpo&s;e. But the activity of the garri&s;on was &s;uch; and all the outpo&s;ts &s;o well &s;ecured, that he thought it more prudent to abandon that de&s;ign, and to po&s;tpone his operations, to the opening of the &s;pring, when a regular &s;iege might be formed.</P>
<P>The forces which &s;till remained in Canada, were not un|equal to the attempt. Ten battalions of regular troops, amounting to near 5000 men; 6000 of experienced militia of Canada; about 300 &s;avages. This was the force which M. Levi had collected at Montreal, and with which he took the field on the 17th of April, 1760.</P>
<P>His provi&s;ions, ammunition, and heavy baggage, fell down the river St. Laurence, under the convoy of &s;ix fri|gates from 44 to 26 guns. By this &s;quadron, which there was nothing to oppo&s;e, he acquired the undi&s;puted com|mand of the river, a point of the greate&s;t importance to
<PB N="257" REF="297">
the whole de&s;ign. In ten days march, the French army arrived at the heights of Abraham three miles from Quebec.</P>
<P>When Gen. Murray perceived the approach of the ene|my, he had two parts to take, either to keep within the town, and confiding in his troops, which though weak as an army, were &s;trong as a garri&s;on, to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege to the utmo&s;t extremity; or to march out, and by trying the fortune of the field, to avoid the tedious hard&s;hips of a &s;iege, in a place which &s;eemed to him &s;carcely tenable.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved on the latter part. But when he came to review his ability for this undertaking, he could po&s;&s;ibly draw into the field no more than 3000 men. However he was not frighted by the enemy's great &s;uperiority. He de|termined to engage; and he grounded his re&s;olution on the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that his army, notwith&s;tanding its inferiority, was in the habit of beating the enemy. That they had a fine train of field artillery; that to &s;hut them&s;elves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the &s;ingle chance of holding out for a con&s;iderable time a wretched fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter, at the &s;ame time that it gave an additional one, and perhaps a better; and in fine, that if the event was not pro&s;perous, he might, after holding out to the la&s;t extremity, retreat, with what &s;hould remain of the garri&s;on, to the i&s;le of Orleans or Coudres, and there wait for reinforcements.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to comprehend the prudence of engaging in the open field, an army four times &s;uperior; e&s;pecially when the weaker army had it in their power to keep upon the de|fen&s;ive in a &s;trong po&s;t; and Quebec may well be con&s;ider|ed at lea&s;t as a &s;trong retrenchment. It is as hard to under|&s;tand how the chance of holding out a fortre&s;s, &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened after a defeat of the troops, which compo&s;e the garri&s;on, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer by &s;uch an event, both in numbers and in &s;pirit; it is equally difficult to conceive how the remains of that garri&s;on, which &s;hould be driven from Quebec, could have &s;afely retreated to the i&s;le of Or|leans or Coudre&s;s, or have remained in either of tho&s;e places, with any tolerable &s;ecurity, whil&s;t the enemy were, as they were, confe&s;&s;edly ma&s;ters of the river. The&s;e are matters not &s;o ea&s;ily comprehended by tho&s;e who are at a di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action; there circum&s;tances may have given the&s;e rea&s;ons their due weight; and they had the

greater influence from the character of the general; a man of the mo&s;t ardent and intripid courage, pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;i|rous of glory, and emulous of the reputation Wolfe had ac|quired. He knew that a bold and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke, and well pur&s;ued, might &s;o di&s;able the enemy, who were in no likelihood of receiving &s;peedy or con&s;iderable &s;uccours from France, that the way to conque&s;t would lie plain and open before him; and he might expect the honour of the total reduction of Canada, before the arrival of the re&s;t of the king's forces to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus depending on fortune, on the tried goodne&s;s of his troops, and his own courage to animate them, he marched out of the city, and de&s;cended from the heights of Abra|ham with the army mentioned above, and twenty field-pie|ces. The right and left of the enemy's van po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of &s;ome &s;mall woody eminences; the main army marched by the road of St. Foix; and formed them&s;elves under the &s;helter of the woods. Whil&s;t the body of the enemies army was yet unformed, the Engli&s;h troops attack|ed their van, both on the right and left, with the ut|mo&s;t impetuo&s;ity, and drove them from the eminences, though they were well maintained; the advanced po&s;ts of the French centre gave way, without a blow, and fell back upon their main army.</P>
<P>Hitherto the fortune of the field was favourable to the Engli&s;h; but now the advantages they had obtained brought them full on the main army of the French, which formed in columns, and advanced with great rapidity to &s;upport their broken vanguard. The fire became very hot, and &s;top|ped the progre&s;s of our troops; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the enemy having &s;upported their centre, wheeled round the flanks of the Briti&s;h army to the left and right, and formed a &s;emi|circle, which threatened to clo&s;e upon our rear. Proper movements were made to protect the flanks, but it was evident the army was in the greate&s;t danger, not only of a defeat, but of &s;eeing it&s;elf &s;urrounded, and its retreat to Quebec intirely intercepted. Near one thou&s;and men, &s;ol|diers and officers, (a third of the army) had been, by this time killed and wounded. Nothing could be now thought of but as &s;peedy a retreat as po&s;&s;ible; and in this there were difficulties, which nothing but the bravery of the &s;ol|diery and the &s;kill and &s;pirit of the officers could overcome. They gained Quebec with little lo&s;s in the pur&s;uit; but
<PB N="259" REF="301">
they were obliged to leave their cannon, which they could not bring off, on account of the wreaths of &s;now, which even in this advanced &s;ea&s;on, and in the temperate latitude of 47, &s;till lay upon the ground. The French lo&s;t at lea&s;t 2000 in the action.</P>
<P>When the account of this victory arrived in Europe, the French were for a while infinitely elated. The blow was &s;en&s;ibly felt in England. Our &s;anguine hopes were at once &s;unk. If Quebec was lo&s;t, it was evident that the greate&s;t difficulties mu&s;t have ari&s;en to our affairs in America, and the reduction of Canada mu&s;t become the work of more than one campaign. Nobody imagined that the town could hold out longer after &s;uch a defeat; and the fleet &s;ent from Europe to reinforce the place was then at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s all things were prepared at Quebec for a vi|gorous defence. The late check he had received, only rou&s;ed the governor to more &s;trenuous efforts. He knew that the lo&s;s of the place would be attributed to the teme|rity of his councils; he was &s;en&s;ible that in proportion to the honours paid by the public to tho&s;e who had conquered Quebec, would their indignation fall upon tho&s;e by whom it &s;hould happen to be lo&s;t; and that in general nothing makes a wor&s;e figure, than a ra&s;hne&s;s which is not fortu|nate. The&s;e thoughts were perpetual &s;tings to a mind like his, pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of glory; and that very di&s;po&s;iti|on which led him to fight un&s;ucce&s;sfully with a weak army, gave him activity and &s;ucce&s;s in the defence of a weak forti|fication.</P>
<P>The French, who&s;e whole hope of &s;ucce&s;s depended on perfecting their work before a Briti&s;h &s;quadron could ar|rive, lo&s;t not a moment's time to improve their victory. They opened trenches before the town the very night of the battle. But it was the 11th of May before they could bring two batteries to play upon the fortifications. They were greatly deficient in this re&s;pect. Their accounts &s;ay, they had no more than twelve pieces of iron artillery, which carried twelve pound balls. The Engli&s;h train, was without compari&s;on, &s;uperior. Before the French had opened their batteries, 132 pieces of cannon were placed on the ramparts. The fire of the be&s;iegers was therefore always &s;lack, interrupted, and of little effect.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the weakne&s;s of the enemies fire, the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h artillery, and the re&s;olution of the
<PB N="260" REF="302">
governor, and garri&s;on, the relief of the place depended en|tirely on the early arrival of the Briti&s;h fleet, which was looked out for every hour with the mo&s;t anxious expectati|on. Had any French &s;hips of force come before the En|gli&s;h, it was the general opinion that the place mu&s;t inevi|tably have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>On the 9th of May to the great joy of the garri&s;on, an Engli&s;h frigate anchored in the ba&s;on and brought them an account that the Briti&s;h &s;quadron commanded by Lord Colville, was then in the river. On the 16th, a &s;hip of the line and a frigate arrived; the next morning the two frigates were &s;ent to attack the French &s;quadron above the town. They executed their commi&s;&s;ion &s;o well, that in a moment all the French ve&s;&s;els of whatever kind were di&s;|per&s;ed, and the greate&s;t part de&s;troyed or taken.</P>
<P>M. Levi, who had the mortification to behold from the eminences this action, which at one &s;troke put an end to all the hopes he had conceived from the late victory, was per&s;uaded that the&s;e frigates by the boldne&s;s of their man|ner, mu&s;t have been the vanguard of a con&s;iderable rein|forcement; and that too clo&s;e at hand: He therefore rai&s;ed the &s;iege in the utmo&s;t hurry and precepitation, leaving be|hind all his artillery, and a great part of his ammunition and baggage, although Lord Colville, with the re&s;t of the &s;quadron, did not arrive at Quebec untill two days after.^(^a^)</P>

<HEAD>The Hon. James Murray's Letter to Mr. Secretary Pitt, dated, Quebec, <DATE>May <HI>25, 1760.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING acquainted General <HI>Amber&s;t,</HI> three weeks ago, that <HI>Quebec</HI> was be&s;ieged, by an army of 15,000 men, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, to do my&s;elf the honour of addre&s;&s;ing directly to you, the more agreeable news of the &s;iege being rai&s;ed, le&s;t, by your receiving the former intelligence, before the latter, &s;ome incon|venience might ari&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>By the journal of my proceedings, &s;ince I have had the com|mand here, which I have the honour to tran&s;mit to you, you will perceive the &s;uperiority we have maintained over the enemy, du|ring the winter, and that all Lower <HI>Canada,</HI> from the Point <HI>Au-Tremble,</HI> was reduced, and had taken the oath of fidelity to the 
<PB N="261" REF="303">
King. You will, no doubt, be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the ene|my's attempts upon our po&s;ts, and ours upon theirs, all tended to the honour of his Maje&s;ty's arms, they were always baffled, and we were con&s;tantly lucky.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;ay as much within the walls; the exce&s;&s;ive cold|ne&s;s of the climate, and con&s;tant living upon &s;alt provi&s;ions, with|out any vegetables, introduced the &s;curvy among the troops, which, getting the better of every precaution of the officer, and every remedy of the &s;urgeon, became as univer&s;al as it was invete|rate, in&s;omuch, that, before the end of April, 1000 were dead, and above 2000 of what remained, totally un&s;it for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I received certain intelligence, that the Che|valier <HI>de Levis</HI> was a&s;&s;embling his army, which had been cantoned in the neighbourhood of <HI>Montreal;</HI> that he had compleated his eight battallions, and forty companies of the Troops de Colonie, from the choice of the <HI>Montreali&s;ts;</HI> had formed the&s;e forty companies into four battalions; and was determinad to be&s;iege us, the moment that St. Laurence was open, of which he was en|tirely ma&s;ter, by means of four King's frigates, and other craft, proper for this extraordinary river.</P>
<P>As I had the honour to acquaint you formerly, that <HI>Quebec</HI> could be looked upon in no other light, than that of a &s;trong can|tonment, and that any works I &s;hould add to it, would be in that &s;tile, my plan of defence was, to take the earlie&s;t opportunity of entrenching my&s;elf upon the heights of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which entirely commanded the ramparts of the place at the di&s;tance of 800 yards, and might have been defended by our numbers again&s;t a large army. But the Chevalier <HI>de Levis</HI> did not give me time to take the advantage of this &s;ituation; the 23d, 24th and 25th of <HI>April.</HI> I attempted to execute the projected lines, for which a provi&s;ion of fa&s;cines, and of every nece&s;&s;ary material, had been made, but found it impracticable, as the earth was &s;till cover'd with &s;now in many places, and every where impregnably bound up by the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The night of the 26th, I was informed, the enemy had land|ed, at Point <HI>Au Tremble,</HI> 10,000 men, and 500 barbarians. The po&s;t we had taken at the embouchure of the river <HI>Caprouge</HI> (the mo&s;t convenient place for di&s;embarking their artillery and &s;tores, and for &s;ecuring their retreat) obliged them to land where they did, 20 miles higher up.</P>
<PB N="262" REF="304">
<P>The 27th, having broke down all the bridges over the <HI>Caprouge,</HI> and &s;ecured the landing places at <HI>Sillery,</HI> and the <HI>Foulon,</HI> I march|ed with the grenadiers piquets, <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s regiment, and two field pieces, and took po&s;t &s;o advantageou&s;ly, as to fru&s;trate the &s;chemes they had laid of cutting off our po&s;ts. They had begun to form from the defile they were obliged to pa&s;s, but thought proper to retreat, on reconnoitring our po&s;ition; and about four this afternoon we marched back to town, having withdrawn all our po&s;ts, with the lo&s;s of two men only, though they did every thing in their power to harra&s;s the rear.</P>
<P>The enemy was greatly &s;uperior in number, it is true; but when I con&s;idered that our little army was in the habit of beating that enemy, and had a very fine train of field artillery; that &s;hut|ting our&s;elves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the &s;ingle chance of holding out for a con&s;iderable time, a wretch|ed fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hard|ly alter, at the &s;ame time it gave an additional one, perhaps a better, I re&s;olved to give them battle; and if the event was not pro&s;perous, to hold out to the la&s;t extremity, and then to retreat to the i&s;le of Orleans, or Coudres, with what was left of the gar|ri&s;on, to wait for reinforcements.</P>
<P>This night the nece&s;&s;ary orders were given, and half an hour after &s;ix next morning, we marched with all the force I could mu&s;ter, viz. three thou&s;and men, and formed the Army on the heights, in the following order; <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>'s <HI>An&s;truther</HI>'s 2d bat|talion of <HI>Royal Americans,</HI> and <HI>Webb</HI>'s, compo&s;ed the right Bri|gade, commanded by Col. <HI>Burton: Kenneny's La&s;celles's, High|landers,</HI> and <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>'s, the left brigade, commanded by Col. <HI>Fra&s;er: Otway</HI>'s, and the third battalion of <HI>Royal Americans,</HI> were the corps de re&s;erve. Major <HI>Dalling</HI>'s corps of light infantry co|vered the right flank, and Capt. <HI>Hazzen</HI>'s company of rangers, with 100 volunteers, under the command of Capt. Donoald Mac|donald, a brave and experienced officer, cover'd the left. The battalions had each two field pieces.</P>
<P>While the line was forming, I reconnitred the enemy, and perceived their van had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ri&s;ing grounds, three quarters of a mile in our front, but that their army was upon the march, in one column, as far as I could &s;ee. I thought this the lucky moment, and moved with the utmo&s;t order to at|tack them, before they had formed. We &s;oon beat them from the 
<PB N="263" REF="305">
heights they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, tho' they were well di&s;puted; and Major <HI>Dalling,</HI> who cannot be too much commended for his be|haviour this day, and his &s;ervices during the winter, forced their corps of grenadiers from a hou&s;e and windmill they had taken hold of, to cover their left flank. Here he, and &s;everal of his officers were wounded; his men, however, pur&s;ued the fugitives to the corps which were now formed to &s;u&s;tain them. They halted, and di&s;per&s;ed along the front of the right, which prevented that wing from taking advantage of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion they had made on the enemy's left. They had immediately orders given them to regain the flank, but, in attempting this, they were charged, thrown into di&s;order, retired to the rear, and from the number of officers killed and wounded, could never again be brought up, during the action. <HI>Otway</HI>'s was in&s;tantly ordered to advance, and &s;u&s;tain the right wing, which the enemy in vain made two at|tempts to penetrate. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, Capt. <HI>Ince,</HI> with the grenadiers of <HI>Otway</HI>'s, were di&s;tingui&s;hed. While this pa&s;&s;ed there, the left were not idle; they had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the enemy of two redoubts, and &s;u&s;tained with unparallelled firmne&s;s the bold united efforts of the enemy's regulars. <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Canadians,</HI> till at la&s;t fairly fought down, and reduced to a handful; though &s;u&s;tained by the 3d battalion of <HI>Royal Americans</HI> from the re&s;erve, and <HI>Kennedy</HI>'s from the centre, where we had nothing to fear, they were obliged to yield to &s;uperior numbers, and a fre&s;h column of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> which penetrated.</P>
<P>The di&s;order of the left was &s;oon communicated to the right; but the whole retired in &s;uch a way, that the enemy did not ven|ture upon a bri&s;k pur&s;uit. We left mo&s;t of our cannon, as the roughne&s;s of the ground, and the wreaths of &s;now, made it im|po&s;&s;ible to bring them off; what could not be brought off were nailed up.</P>
<P>Our killed and wounded amounted to one third of tho&s;e in the field; that of the enemy, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, exceeds 2500 men; which may be readily conceived, as the action la&s;ted an hour and three quarters.</P>
<P>Here I think it my duty to expre&s;s my gratitude to the officers in general, and the &s;atisfaction I had in the bravery of all the troops.</P>
<P>On the night of the 28th, the enemy opened trenches again&s;t the town; and, at the &s;ame, we &s;et to work within, to for|tify 
<PB N="264" REF="306">
it, which we never had in our power to attempt &s;ooner, from the &s;everity of this climate during the winter, and the ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity of executing works of more immediate importance la&s;t au|tumn, before the fro&s;t &s;et in. I wanted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Major <HI>Mackeller,</HI> the chief engineer, dangerou&s;ly wounded in the action; his zeal for, and knowledge in the &s;ervice, is well known; but the alacrity of the garri&s;on made up for every defect.</P>
<P>My journal of the &s;iege which accompanies this, &s;ets forth in full what was done; and I flatter my&s;elf, the extraordinary per|formances of the handful of brave men I had left, will plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty, as much as they &s;urprized us who were eye witne&s;&s;es to them.</P>
<P>Great prai&s;e is due to Commodore <HI>Swanton,</HI> and the Captains <HI>Schomberg</HI> and <HI>Dean;</HI> I have not words to expre&s;s the readine&s;s, vivacity, and valour they &s;hewed in attacking and de&s;troying the enemy's &s;quadron. Capt. <HI>Dean</HI> has lo&s;t his &s;hip; but it was in a good cau&s;e, and he has done honour to his country.</P>
<P>The morning of the 27th of <HI>May,</HI> I had intended a &s;trong for|tie, to have penetrated into the enemy's camp, which, from the information of the pri&s;oners I had taken, and the concurrent ac|count of the de&s;erters, I conceived to be very practicable.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I had ordered the regiments of <HI>Amher&s;t, Town&s;hend, La&s;celles, An&s;truther,</HI> and <HI>Highlanders,</HI> with the grenadiers and light infantry under arms, but was informed by Lieut. <HI>M'Alpin,</HI> of my battalion (whom I &s;ent out to amu&s;e the enemy with &s;mall allies) that their trenches were abandoned.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly pu&s;hed out at the head of the&s;e corps, not doubting but we mu&s;t have overtaken and forced their rear, and had ample revenge for the 28th of <HI>April;</HI> but I was di&s;appointed, for they had cro&s;&s;ed the river <HI>Caprouge,</HI> before we could come up with them. However, we took &s;everal pri&s;oners, and much baggage, which would otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped. They left their camp &s;tand|ing; all their baggage, &s;tores, magazines of provi&s;ions and am|munition, 34 pieces of battering cannon, four of which are bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s 12 pounders, 10 field pieces, 6 mortars, 4 petards, a large quan|titg of &s;caling ladders and entrenching tools beyond number; and have retired to their former a&s;ylum, <HI>Jacques Cartier.</HI> From the information of pri&s;oners, de&s;erters and &s;pies, provi&s;ions are very &s;carce: ammunition does not abound; and the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Canadians</HI> have de&s;erted them.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Winter remarkably &s;evere &s;ucceeded the bloody cam|paign of 1758. At Bareith in the night of the 16th of December, the cold was in&s;upportable. Reamur's
<PB N="267" REF="309">
therometer was &s;unk to 15, which is preci&s;ely the &s;ame degree it fell to in 1709. A year like this di&s;tingui&s;hed by the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, and the fury of war. Birds dropped dead in their flight. At Leip&s;ic ten centinels were froze to death. An infectious di&s;ea&s;e which began in the armies, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among the inhabitants of Saxony, and made a dreadful havock. A pe&s;tilential contagion ra|ged among the cattle. Famine was &s;oon added to the re&s;t of their calamities; and every mi&s;ery that can afflict man|kind, was poured out upon that unfortunate people with the mo&s;t liberal mea&s;ure. There was no pro&s;pect of an al|levation of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es. On the contrary, the &s;uffer|ings of the people only made their &s;overeigns more earne&s;t for revenge; and out of the general want a re&s;ource aro&s;e to their armies, who were the more readily recruited, be|cau&s;e the &s;canty pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oldier, became an object of envy to the wretched pea&s;antry in mo&s;t of the&s;e countries; and death &s;eemed more honourable and le&s;s certain by the &s;word, than by penury and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>France and England vied in their endeavours to augment their forces in Germany. M. Broglio had now the com|mand of the grand army, and the &s;ole conduct of the ge|neral plan of operations. He had early in this year, been honoured with the &s;taff of a mar&s;hal of France. And no|thing was omitted to give lu&s;tre to his command, and to furni&s;h him with every means of exerting his talents. His corps was augmented to near 100,000 effective men. Thir|ty thou&s;and drawn out of their quarters in Du&s;&s;eldorp, Cleves, Cologne and We&s;el, and compleated by draughts from France, formed a &s;eperate army on the Rhine, under the Count de St. Germain. This di&s;po&s;ition was made not only to divide the attention of the allied army, but to prevent the ill con&s;equences of the mi&s;under&s;tanding which was known to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between this general and the Duke de Broglio. The third army propo&s;ed at the clo&s;e of the foregoing campain did not appear.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of England, the preparations were not le&s;s con&s;iderable in proportion to her ability for that kind of war. Six regiments of foot commanded by Major Gene|ral Griffin, were forthwith &s;ent to reinforce the allied ar|my. Elliot's regiment of light hor&s;e &s;oon followed them. At the opening of this campaign, we had in Germany twelve regiments of heavy, and one of light hor&s;e; and
<PB N="268" REF="310">
twelve regiments, with two Highland battalions of foot; the whole amounted to near 22,000 men. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, they were further reinforced to near 25,000, Such a number of Briti&s;h troops, &s;erving in one army, had not been &s;een on the continent, for two hundred years pa&s;t. The allied army indeed fell &s;hort of the French in numbers; but they exceeded it in the quality of the troops. Tho&s;e newly arrived from England were fre&s;h but not undi&s;ciplin|ed; the old were indeed harra&s;&s;ed, but they had been ac|cu&s;tomed to victory.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year, the death of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el had excited &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ions;

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 31."> 

 the di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or were uncertain; and his withdrawing him&s;elf from the cau&s;e of the allies would have made a breach in their army, that it would have proved almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top. But the&s;e fears were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. The new Landgrave among the very fir&s;t acts of his government, gave the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of his &s;teady adherence to the &s;y&s;tem of his father, and even agreed to add con&s;iderably to the He&s;&s;ian troops in the pay of Great Britain; &s;o that all things promi&s;ed as favourably to the allies, as from that irremediable inferiority in numbers could have been expected.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was under far greater difficulties; he had felt the heavie&s;t blows, and was mo&s;t &s;canted in the means of healing them.</P>
<P>His lo&s;&s;es were not to be reckoned by the men killed and pri&s;oners, but by armies de&s;troyed or taken. Forty gene|rals had died, or were &s;lain in his &s;ervice, &s;ince the 1&s;t of October 1756, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who had been wounded, di&s;abled, or made pri&s;oners. And this alone would have been a lo&s;s not to be repaired, if the&s;e murdering wars which cut off &s;o many experienced officers, did not at the &s;ame time, form &s;o many more to &s;upply their places. The king had renewed his alliance on the former terms with Great Britain. By his indefatigable indu&s;try, no gaps were &s;een in his armies. But they were no longer the &s;ame troops, and if the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had formerly the merit of ably commanding the mo&s;t excellent armies; he has now to fill up the mo&s;t remarkable deficiency on the part of his troops by his own heroi&s;m; and to undertake far more ar|duous enterprizes, than his fir&s;t, with infinitely weaker in|&s;truments. His affairs wore a bad a&s;pect in the opening of
<PB N="269" REF="311">
the former year. In this they &s;eemed altogether de&s;pe|rate.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;uffered; but they were &s;ufficiently reinforced. The Swedes who had been generally obliged to give ground in the winter, had in that of 1759 the ad|vantage in &s;everal &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hes, and had even taken pri&s;oner the Pru&s;&s;ian general Manteuffel. As to the Au&s;|trians, victorious for a whole campaign almo&s;t without fighting, their armies and magazines were full, their corps compleat, their men fre&s;h, vigorous, and full of re&s;olution. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes of con&s;equence had been fought during the ce&s;&s;ation of the great operations; and they were gene|rally to their advantage.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;en&s;ible, that in this, as in the former campaigns, he &s;hould be attacked by four armies; and that his dominions would be inve&s;ted upon every &s;ide. As the&s;e operations were very exten&s;ive and complicated, to enable the reader to form an idea of the campaign, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of the ground the king had to defend, which is circum&s;tanced in this manner.</P>
<P>To the north is Pomerania. This country is very open; and it is defended on that part on which the Swedes gene|rally act, with but few, and tho&s;e mean fortifications, An|clam, Demmein and Pa&s;&s;ewalk. But then the Swedi&s;h army is not numerous, and if they &s;hould attempt to pene|trate far into the country, they mu&s;t leave Stetin, in which there is always a &s;trong garri&s;on behind them to their left, which would render their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence difficult, and their re|treat in ca&s;e of any misfortune, extremely hazardous; and they have not &s;ufficient &s;trength to ma&s;ter this place by a regular &s;iege. This has always proved a check to the pro|gre&s;s of that army, even when they have been otherwi&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This &s;ame country to the ea&s;tward of the Oder, is one great object of the Ru&s;&s;ian de&s;igns. Its chief &s;trength in this quarter is the town of Colberg; a place they have frequently attempted, but always without &s;ucce&s;s. And their failure, in this in&s;tance, has been the main cau&s;e why they have never been able to take winter quarters in the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions, or even during the campaign, to make any con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon Pomerania. For they can have no communication with their own country by &s;ea, for want of this port. On their rear, lies the exten|&s;ive
<PB N="270" REF="312">
and inho&s;pitable de&s;ert of Waldow; and this with the uncertain di&s;po&s;ition of the city of Dantzick, renders their &s;upplies of provi&s;ion from Poland difficult and precarious. Neither is it po&s;&s;ible in the&s;e circum&s;tances, to unite their forces with tho&s;e of Sweden acting in the &s;ame country. The Oder flows between them; which is &s;o commanded by the city of Stetin, as to make all communication between the&s;e armies in a great mea&s;ure impracticable. In&s;omuch, that on the &s;ide of Pomerania, the force of the&s;e two pow|ers is compelled to act &s;eparately, without concert, and therefore weakly and ineffectually.</P>
<P>To the we&s;tward, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is &s;ufficiently co|vered by the city of Magdebourg, the &s;tronge&s;t place in his dominions, and in that part of Germany. Here are his greate&s;t magazines, and his principal founderies; and this is the repo&s;itory of whatever he finds nece&s;&s;ary to place out of the reach of &s;udden in&s;ult.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhward he is obliged to defend Saxony and Si|le&s;ia. Both of the&s;e countries on their frontiers towards Bo|hemia, ri&s;e into very rough, broken, and mountainous grounds, abounding in advantageous po&s;ts and &s;trong &s;itua|tions. Lu&s;atia lies between them; a level &s;andy plain, (in|ter&s;per&s;ed with pine-woods,) extending without any ob&s;ta|cle to the very gates of Berlin. Through this country the king's communication between Sile&s;ia and Saxony mu&s;t be kept up, and therefore it has been from the beginning of this war, the great &s;cene of tho&s;e remarkable marches and counter-marches, by which his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty has acqui|red &s;o great a reputation; and al&s;o of tho&s;e bold and &s;udden attempts which have di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome of the generals of the adver&s;e party. As an army cannot be advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in this territory, it has not been u&s;ual for a con&s;ider|ably body to remain there long; and it is particularly un|favourable to defen&s;ive operations. This country may be con&s;idered as the curtin, and the frontiers of Saxony and Sile&s;ia as the ba&s;tions, that flank the &s;ort of fortification, which the king is to maintain.</P>
<P>No part of that monarch's territories are naturally more defencele&s;s than the ea&s;tern; at the &s;ame time that it is at|tacked by the mo&s;t powerful of his enemies. A country al|together &s;andy and level, extends along both &s;ides of the Oder, from the northern frontier of Sile&s;ia, until it meets Pomerania, a country of the &s;ame kind. There is no re|&s;pectable
<PB N="271" REF="313">
fortification on this &s;ide; and the river Warta that falls here into the Oder, makes the tran&s;port of pro|vi&s;ions, and con&s;equently the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the armies that act again&s;t him more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>As to Sile&s;ia, it is covered on the Bohemian &s;ide with mountains, and it contains places of &s;uch &s;trength as to be above the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the fir&s;t army that appears before them. Indeed it is to be remarked, that &s;uch a de|gree of &s;trength &s;eems &s;ufficient for the kind of &s;ervice which has di&s;tingui&s;hed this war. Never was a war of &s;uch a length and extent, in which fewer &s;ieges of con&s;equence have been formed; and the late &s;ervice which affords &s;o large a field for experience in every other &s;pecies of military operations, affords very little matter of improvement in the art of reducing or defending &s;trong places.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's de&s;ign &s;eems to have been to &s;ave him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible to the end of the campaign; the only time when his &s;ucce&s;s might be deci&s;ive, and his ill-fortune not ruinous. He therefore formed a defen&s;ive plan. In pur&s;uance of this he withdrew his out-po&s;ts from Freyberg, and drawing a chain of cantonments from the fore&s;t of Tharandt on his right to the Elbe, he took a mo&s;t advantageous camp between that river and the Multa; &s;trongly intrenching it where it had not been previou&s;ly for|tified by nature; and furni&s;hed it with &s;o numerous an ar|tillery, that they reckoned in their front only 250 pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he covered the mo&s;t material parts of Saxony, kept the attention of M. Daun's army engaged, and was enabled to &s;end out reinforcements to Prince Henry, or el&s;ewhere, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, without expo&s;ing one part whil&s;t he defended the other.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King's army defended his conque&s;ts in Mi&s;|nia, Prince Henry had a&s;&s;embled an army about Franckfort on the Oder, and took various po&s;itions about that place and Cro&s;&s;en. In this po&s;ition, he commanded three prin|cipal communications, in &s;uch a manner as to protect at once Sile&s;ia, the New Marche of Brandenburg, and the avenues to Berlin; all which were threatened by &s;everal bo|dies of the enemy. General Fouquet had e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters near the county of Glatz, and whil&s;t he covered that &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, he communicated with Prince Henry, and
<PB N="272" REF="314">
was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to &s;end to or receive &s;uccours from him, as either party &s;hould happen to be pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>M. Daun, as &s;oon as he &s;aw that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had fortified him&s;elf in his po&s;t, he too buried him&s;elf in en|trenchments, and kept the mo&s;t attentive eye upon all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> maje&s;ty's motions. Whil&s;t he confined him&s;elf in this po|&s;ition, in order to tie down the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Laudohn, with a &s;trong but light and di&s;incumbered army, moved from the camp he had occupied during the winter in Bohemia, and pre&s;enting him&s;elf alternately on the &s;ide o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lu&s;atia, and on the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, threatened &s;ome|times to penetrate into Berlin, &s;ometimes by a bold &s;troke to effect a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians, and attack Prince Henry, &s;ometimes to &s;it down before Glatz, Schweidnitz, or Bre&s;lau; and thus the alarm was &s;pread upon every &s;ide, not knowing where the &s;torm would fall.</P>
<P>At length he declared him&s;elf. Having by &s;everal fein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;uaded general Fouquet that his intentions were again&s;t Schweidnitz, that general marched thither a con&s;iderable body of his troops, and left Glatz uncovered. As &s;oon as Laudohn perceived this movement, he on his &s;ide made another, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Land&s;hut; and when he had taken Land&s;hut, he pretended a de&s;ign of &s;ecuring this po&s;t by leaving a &s;mall body of troops there. This feint al&s;o &s;ucceeded, and drew general Fouquet from Schweid|nitz back again to Land&s;hut. He drove the Au&s;trians from that place without difficulty; but in the mean time Lau|dohn made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal important pa&s;&s;es, by which he was in &s;ome &s;ort enabled to &s;urround the corps of General Fouquet.</P>
<P>The commander finding him&s;elf in tho&s;e dangerous cir|cum&s;tances, had nothing left but to fortify his po&s;t, for|merly made a very &s;trong one, with additional works; which he did with &s;uch effect, that it had more the re&s;em|blance of a regular fortification than an entrenchment. How|ever, the army he commanded was far from numerous; and he was obliged to weaken it &s;till farther by a detachment of 2000 men, to pre&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, a communication with Schweidnitz.</P>
<P>Laudohn longed to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by &s;ome capital &s;troke; he had now by a &s;eries of very artful movements procured a mo&s;t favourable opportunity. Fir&s;t, therefore, he &s;hut up with great dexterity the pa&s;&s;es on every &s;ide, and
<PB N="273" REF="315">
rendered his adver&s;ary's retreat impracticable. Then he began an attack on the Pru&s;&s;ian entrenchments in the dead of the night in three different places.

 <MILESTONE N="June 23."> 

 The &s;ignal for the a&s;&s;ault was given by four hawbitzers fired in the air. The Au&s;trians ru&s;hed to the attack with uncommon fury, and maintained it with &s;o &s;teady a re&s;o|lution, that in three quarters of an hour the two &s;tronge&s;t entrenchments were carried, and the line of communicati|on forced: The Pru&s;&s;ians at day-break found them&s;elves pu&s;hed back from hill to hill, and line to line, to their la&s;t entrenchments. Their re&s;i&s;tance was all along brave, and their retreat regular. The enemy purcha&s;ed every advan|tage at the deare&s;t rate; but at la&s;t pre&s;&s;ed upon every &s;ide, worn down by a terrible &s;laughter, their general di&s;abled by two mortal wounds, at eight in the morning the rem|nant of the army threw down their arms and &s;urrendered on the field of battle.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the vanqui&s;hed, the &s;lain were about 4000. The pri&s;oners were, one general of foot, namely general Fouquet; two major generals; two hundred and thirteen officers of the inferior rank; and upwards of 7000 private &s;oldiers, 58 pieces of artillery, with a number of colours. Never was a more entire and deci&s;ive victory. The whole army, general, officers, every thing was de&s;troyed. Scarce three hundred of the body intrenched by Land&s;hut e&s;caped. The corps alone which was to pre&s;erve the communicati|on, together with &s;ome bodies of cavalry who had not been engaged, with difficulty got into Schweidnitz, where they expected every moment to be be&s;ieged. This advantage co&s;t the Au&s;trians above 12000 men killed and wounded.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS victory was pur&s;ued with as much rapidity as it was obtained with courage and addre&s;s. Baron Lau|dohn immediately returned back from Land&s;hut, fell
<PB N="274" REF="316">
like a &s;torm upon Glatz. Glatz con&s;i&s;ts of two fortre&s;&s;es, the old and the new. The old was taken by &s;torm; the new &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. Two thou&s;and brave men and &s;ome good works could not defend it again&s;t the impe|tuo&s;ity of the Au&s;trians. One hundred and one pieces of bra&s;s cannon were taken. Immen&s;e magazines of provi&s;i|on and military &s;tores piled up in this frontier place to fa|vour in better times an irruption into Bohemia, fell into the hands of the conqueror. Every thing gave way. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Glatz laid all Sile&s;ia open, and the Au&s;trians might turn their arms upon any &s;ide without the lea&s;t dan|ger to the freedom of their retreat. Neither was there any &s;ort of army to give the lea&s;t ob&s;truction. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia held down by M. Daun, was in Saxony. Prince Henry was al&s;o at a great di&s;tance towards Cu&s;trin. If that Prince attempted to move to the relief of Sile&s;ia, he laid open Brandenburgh, and even Berlin it&s;elf to the irruptions of the Ru&s;&s;ians. If he remained in his po&s;t, Sile&s;ia was in|evitably lo&s;t. Even his &s;peedie&s;t march &s;eemed by no means a certain way to releive it. The King was yet further di&s;|tant; and any motion of his threatened to &s;hake and un|hinge the whole &s;cheme of his defence; expo&s;ing at once Saxony and Berlin. The lo&s;s of his third army, &s;mall as that army was, laid him under difficulties that &s;eemed in|&s;uperable.</P>
<P>Favoured by the&s;e circum&s;tances, Laudohn had only to chu&s;e what direction he &s;hould give his arms. Sile&s;ia, as has been ob&s;erved, lay open before him. He had threat|ened Schweidnitz; but he &s;aw that Bre&s;law was a place of greater con&s;equence, much more ea&s;ily reduced, and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it facilitated a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians; a point on which the ultimate improvement of his victory wholly depended. The place be&s;ides is of &s;o great extent, and the works of &s;o little comparative &s;trength, that he had no &s;mall hopes of ma&s;tering it before Prince Henry could come, if he &s;hould at all attempt to come to its re|lief.</P>
<P>He therefore delayed no longer than the march of his heavy artillery and the nece&s;&s;ary preparatives required, to lay &s;iege to the capital of Sile&s;ia, of who&s;e &s;afety the mo&s;t &s;anguine friends of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty began to di&s;pair,</P>
<P>But in the interval between the battle of Land&s;hut and the commencement of the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau, the King of
<PB N="275" REF="317">
Pru&s;&s;ia was not idle. His thoughts were continually em|ployed to repair this di&s;a&s;ter; all ordinary re&s;ources were impracticable or ineffectual. His genius alone could enter the li&s;ts with his ill fortune. Placing therefore his hopes in him&s;elf, he aimed by a daring and unexpected &s;troke, to draw even from &s;o &s;evere a misfortune &s;ome new and more brilliant advantages.</P>
<P>In pur&s;ance of the plan he had laid,

 <MILESTONE N="July 2."> 

 he di&s;po|&s;ed all things for a march towards Sile&s;ia, and had pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe and penetrated through a woody coun|try without oppo&s;ition; had the enemy been appri&s;ed of his march as early as he began it, it had been attended with great and un&s;urmountable difficulties. Mar&s;hal Daun no &s;ooner had advice of his march, than he al&s;o immediately moved with the utmo&s;t expedition at the head of his main army towards Sile&s;ia, leaving the army of the empire, and a body under General Lacy, to awe Saxony in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The two armies continued their route through Lu&s;atia; that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia a little to the northward, that of Mar&s;hal Daun to the &s;outhward; both apparently pu&s;h|ing towards the &s;ame object, and with equal eagerne&s;s. But as the army of the mar&s;hal had rather the &s;horter cut to make, and as he moved with far greater and more unaf|fected diligence, he got very con&s;iderably the &s;tart of the King.</P>
<P>When his maje&s;ty was appri&s;ed that M. Daun had gained full two days march upon him;

 <MILESTONE N="July 8."> 

 that he had actually arrived at Gorlitz, and was pu&s;hing by forced marches to Lauban; his great purpo&s;e was ob|tained. Immediately he &s;truck into M. Daun's track, but wheeled into the oppo&s;ite direction, repa&s;&s;ed the Spree near Bautzen, and whil&s;t every one imagined him on the fron|tiers of Sile&s;ia, he &s;uddenly &s;prung up like a mine before Dre&s;den. The army of the Empire retired. Lacy's corps was obliged to &s;hift its &s;ituation. The Pru&s;&s;ian generals Hul&s;en and Ziethen, who had probably been prepared to act in con|cert with the King, joined him before that place, and knowing there was no room for delay,

 <MILESTONE N="July 13."> 

 began the &s;iege with the utmo&s;t vigour.</P>
<P>Then was this mo&s;t unfortunate city a third time expo|&s;ed to the fury of war. The inhabitants &s;uffered in their habitations for the weakne&s;s of the works; and there were armies both without and within of &s;uch mutual and deter|mined
<PB N="276" REF="318">
rage, and &s;o carele&s;s of all things but their enmity, that they little &s;crupled to &s;trike at each other through the bodies of the &s;uffering Saxons. All Europe had now its eyes turned to the event of this ma&s;terly manoeuvre; and certainly through the whole cour&s;e of this eventful war, nothing appeared more worthy of regard, nor at any time had there been exhibited a piece of general&s;hip more com|pleat, than the conduct of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march.</P>
<P>Since Dre&s;den had fallen into the hands of the Au&s;trians, it had been &s;trengthened with the addition of &s;everal new works. The burning of the &s;uburbs by the Pru&s;&s;ians, in order to keep them out, became an advantage to them when they came to po&s;&s;e&s;s the town. In &s;hort, the place, was rendered in all re&s;pects more defen&s;ible than formerly. It had al&s;o a very large garri&s;on under General Macguire, an officer of courage and experience, who re&s;olved to main|tain it to the la&s;t extremity: when he was &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, he made an&s;wer, "That it was impo&s;&s;ible the king could have been appri&s;ed with his being entru&s;ted with the command of that capital; otherwi&s;e &s;o great a captain as his maje&s;ty would not make &s;uch a propo&s;al to an officer of his &s;tanding: that he would defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t man; and wait whatever the king &s;hould think proper to attempt."</P>
<P>Both parties being therefore in&s;pired with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution, the one to attack, the other to defend, the &s;iege was pu&s;hed on by every method of force and addre&s;s; there was &s;carce any intermi&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;aults, &s;urprizes, coups de mains, &s;allies, and all kind of actions u&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and all the mo&s;t vigorous in their way. In the mean time three batteries of cannon and mortars played continually, but with much greater damage to the buildings than effect on the fortifications.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Daun was in Sile&s;ia when he heard all at once of the deceit put upon him by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, of his return to Saxony, of the &s;iege, and the extreme danger of Dre&s;den. His return was as rapid as his march had been. On the 19th he appeared within a league of Dre&s;den. His approach only cau&s;ed the Pru&s;&s;ians to redouble their efforts; that day they had received reinforcements of heavy cannon and mortars, and battered the place with new fury. The cathedral church, the new &s;quare, &s;everal principal &s;treets, &s;ome palaces, the noble manufactory of porcelain, were all entirely reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="319">The &s;iege continued till the 22d. The night of the 21&s;t, M. Daun had thrown &s;ixteen battalions into Dre&s;den. It was in vain to continue any longer the pretence of be&s;ieg|ing a whole army within the town, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time there was another army to reinforce it without. The king withdrew his forces without mole&s;tation from the &s;uburbs, though there were three con&s;iderable armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood, be&s;ides that which was within the walls.</P>
<P>Thus ended, without the &s;ucce&s;s &s;o ma&s;terly, a proceed|ing de&s;erved, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's famous &s;tratagem. But the want of &s;ucce&s;s can detract nothing from the merit of the mea&s;ure. By drawing Mar&s;hal Daun from Saxony to Sile&s;ia he gained the u&s;e of eight days, free of ob&s;truction from the enemy's grand army; eight days at a time when hours and even moments were critical. In this time he had certainly a chance at lea&s;t of reducing Dre&s;den; and by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place he would have found him&s;elf in|finitely better able to carry his arms to the defence of every part of his territories for the pre&s;ent, and for the future would have that great place of retreat in ca&s;e of any misfor|tune. If he failed in this attempt his affairs were preci&s;ely in their former condition; and he could not &s;uffer in repu|tation by having made it.</P>
<P>As the King of Pru&s;&s;ia could not be blamed for the &s;peedy return of Mar&s;hal Daun, and the con&s;equences of that re|turn; &s;o neither in effect could the Mar&s;hal &s;uffer any ju&s;t imputation in having been deceived by the king's march. He knew that there were very plau&s;ible motives to call, and even to pre&s;s him to move that way. He knew that if the king &s;hould get into Sile&s;ia without any oppo&s;ition from him, Laudohn might not only be deprived of all the advan|tages he could hope for from his late victory, but by being attacked by the united armies of the king and his brother, would run the ri&s;que of a defeat that might fully revenge that of Land&s;hut.</P>
<P>Whatever the merit of either of the commanders might be on this occa&s;ion, it is certain that Laudohn met no con|&s;iderable ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>But Laudohn who &s;aw all things prepared for an ob&s;ti|nate defence, did not wholly tru&s;t to his military manoeu|vres. He &s;ent a letter to the governor Count Tavenzien, to intimidate him by the di&s;play of his &s;trength. He &s;et
<PB N="278" REF="320">
forth, that his forces con&s;i&s;ted of 50 battalions and 80 &s;qua|drons; that the Ru&s;&s;ian army of 75,000 men were within three days march; that it was in vain for the governor to expect &s;uccour from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was then at the other &s;ide of the Elbe, that it was &s;till more vain to look for relief from Prince Henry, who could &s;carce hope to &s;tand his own ground again&s;t the grand army of the Ru&s;&s;ians; that in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy he could expect no rea&s;onable terms: and that the&s;e were the la&s;t that &s;hould be offered. Moreover he reminded him that the place was a mercantile town, not a fortre&s;s; and that he could not defend it without contravening the laws of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules, by which honour is reduced to act, not by its own feelings, but according to intrin&s;ical circum|&s;tances; rules by which they have attempted to determine exactly and mechanically that nice&s;t of all lines which di&s;|criminates courage from ra&s;hne&s;s, form one of the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances of the great difference between the antient and modern methods and ideas of war. In the antient times, a brave commander would have an&s;wered this threatning me&s;&s;age in general terms of defiance. But Count Taven|zien re&s;pected the&s;e imaginary laws. He took care to prove that in defending the town, he did not infringe them; and &s;poke as Laudohn had done in the character of a military juri&s;con&s;ult, as well as a &s;oldier; he gave for reply. That the town of Bre&s;law being &s;urrounded with works and wet ditches, was to be con&s;idered as a place of &s;trength, and not &s;imply as a mercantile town. That the Au&s;trians them&s;elves defended it as &s;uch in 1757, after the battle of Li&s;&s;a. That the king had command|ed him to defend it to the la&s;t extremity, that therefore General Laudohn might &s;ee it was not from humour he had refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to his &s;ummons. That he was not frighted with the General's threats to de&s;troy the town; for he was not entru&s;ted with the care of the hou&s;es, but the fortifications.</P>
<P>Laudohn had al&s;o &s;ent in a memorial in the &s;ame menac|ing &s;tile, where he thought it might have a greater effect, to the civil magi&s;trates, hoping that the ruin with which the town was threatened, might induce them join with the inhabitants, to per&s;uade the governor to a &s;peedy &s;urrender.</P>
<P>All the&s;e menacing mea&s;ures &s;eemed to argue a fear in
<PB N="279" REF="321">
Baron Laudohn, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were not &s;o near as he pretended, and that the town might po&s;&s;ibly be releived be|fore their arrival. However he &s;hewed them, at nine of the very evening of the me&s;&s;age, that his threats were not vain, by a terrible di&s;charge of mortars and red hot balls that fell in an uninterrupted &s;hower upon the city untill midnight. During this fierce bombardment, that made a dreadful havock in the town, he attempted the out-works by a&s;&s;ault. His Croats attacked the covered-way in many places at once, with the u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity of tho&s;e brave irregulars; but they were received and repul&s;ed with a re&s;olution equal to their own, and with more &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>This operation of this dreadful night having made no im|pre&s;&s;ion on the inflexible determination of the governor, Baron Laudohn had once more recour&s;e to negotiation. He now changed his &s;tile, and held out the mo&s;t flattering pro|po&s;itions; offering to grant him what capitulations he &s;hould think proper to a&s;k, and even to leave him&s;elf to draw up the articles. The governor replied that the firing the town had made no change in his re&s;olution; and he would wait with firmne&s;s for the enemy upon the ramparts; but that he could not help ob&s;erving it was contrary to the laws of arms to begin the &s;iege of a fortre&s;s, by ruining its inha|bitants. The me&s;&s;enger made an&s;wer, that the trenches would be &s;oon opened. The governor &s;aid, it was what he had long expected.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians, foiled in their hopes from treaty, conti|nued to batter the town, and made &s;everal attacks upon the out-works for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. They found every po&s;t bravely defended; the Ru&s;&s;ian army did not appear, but they now began to perceive the approach of another army le&s;s agreeable; that of Prince Henry; which having marched with the utmo&s;t diligence from Great Glogau, now came fa&s;t upon him; and on the 5th of Augu&s;t, reached within a few miles of the town.</P>
<P>Laudohn did not think it expedient to put the advantage he had gained, and tho&s;e which he had yet to expect from the management of time, to the i&s;&s;ue of a battle; he there|fore decamped and made his retreat in good order, but with &s;ufficient quickne&s;s; having procured from this enterpri&s;e only the wretched &s;atisfaction of reducing a great part of the city to a heap of rubbi&s;h, and of having revenged upon Bre&s;law &s;ome part of the &s;ufferings of Dre&s;den.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE French and allied armies had been reinforced in the manner we have already mentioned. But the vigour of their operations did not altogether corre&s;pond with what might have been expected from their &s;trength and mutual animo&s;ity. The campaign, at lea&s;t in any effective manner, opened late. A country which had been &s;o long the theatre of &s;o ruinous a war, had been too much wa&s;ted to make the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and con&s;equently the free motion of the armies ea&s;y. The winter had been &s;evere and long; and it was not untill the green forage appeared plentifully above ground, that tho&s;e great bodies of cavalry, which make &s;o large a part in our modern armies, were in a condition to act. The &s;ufferings of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e, from a want of dry forage, during a great part of the winter and the &s;pring had been extreme; this obliged them to fall much farther back from the French cantonments; and to mole&s;t them le&s;s than they otherwi&s;e would have done. It was be&s;ides a lo&s;s, that at the opening of the campaign, they had &s;o exten&s;ive a tract between them and Hanover; which by an artful choice of po&s;ts might have been yielded &s;tep by &s;tep, and the campaign &s;o managed and &s;pun out, that the &s;ea&s;on of action mu&s;t have expired, before the French could have reaped any deci&s;ive advantage from their &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Although the French were during the winter &s;upplied far better than the allies with all nece&s;&s;aries by the com|mand of the Maine, the Mo&s;elle and the Rhine; and that the countries at their back had been much le&s;s con&s;umed by the war; yet the &s;ame difficulties embarra&s;&s;ed them as &s;oon as they thought of taking the field, and quitting their advantageous cantonment. Therefore there was a &s;low|ne&s;s in the principal armies upon both parts, until the mid|dle of &s;ummer.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="323">Not however, but that &s;omething was attempted in this interval, by le&s;&s;er parties. On the &s;ide of the Rhine, &s;ome actions happened between the army of St. Germain, and the corps of General Sporken, who was po&s;ted at Dulmen, to ob&s;erve the French in that quarter. Dulmen formed the right flank of the chain of cantonments made by the allied army, which extended its left to the &s;outh-ea&s;t fron|tiers of the country of He&s;&s;e, above an hundred and fifty miles di&s;tant. The Hereditary Prince who was on that wing, exerted, as much as circum&s;tances would permit, his u&s;ual activity and enterprize. He threw him&s;elf into the di&s;trict of Fulda; he laid it under an heavy contribution and broke up &s;everal French corps that were po&s;ted there.</P>
<P>The&s;e actions decided nothing. The French army &s;u|perior in numbers, and in &s;ituation, advanced; and the allies, who &s;eemed to have cho&s;en the defen&s;ive, gradually retired. In effect, if the French had pur&s;ued their original plan, it would have proved almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the allied army to maintain its ground. If St. Germain, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Cleves, We&s;el, and Du&s;&s;eldorp, had advanced on the &s;ide of Mun&s;ter; and M. Broglio moving forward through the country of He&s;&s;e, had made a &s;trong detachment to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, whil&s;t with his main body he en|gaged the attention of Prince Ferdinand, the allies would &s;hortly have found them&s;elves enclo&s;ed upon three &s;ides; and nothing could have extricated them but a capital vic|tory obtained under every di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>The French army was &s;ufficiently numerous for the&s;e operations. But it was &s;u&s;pected that the jealou&s;y which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between M. de St. Germain and the Duke of Broglio prevented their being carried into execution. This mi&s;under&s;tanding daily increa&s;ed. In&s;omuch, that M. Broglio thought fit to order the corps of St. Germain to unite it&s;elf with the grand army. The count, who could not brook obedience to a younger officer, and one be&s;ides with whom he was not on the be&s;t terms, re|tired from the &s;ervice.

 He had only &s;erved be|fore upon condition of commanding an army en|tirely di&s;tinct, and under his own particular orders. This difference deprived France of one of its mo&s;t able generals, and di&s;concerted one of its mo&s;t promi&s;ed &s;chemes of operation.</P>
<P>Before this mi&s;under&s;tanding had produced the&s;e effects,
<PB N="282" REF="324">
the affairs of the French went on with all imaginable pro&s;perity. The principal army not retarding it&s;elf, by con&s;ideration of the places of &s;trength which the allies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their front, the ca&s;tles of Marburg and Dillen|bourg, pu&s;hed forward into the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e, leaving detachments to reduce tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t of which &s;urrendered on the 30th of June, the latter held out to the 16th of July; but the garri&s;ons of both &s;ur|rendered pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>In the mean time whil&s;t M. Broglio advanced on the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e;

 <MILESTONE N="July 10."> 

 the corps of St. Germain had penetrated through the dutchy of We&s;tphalia, and the two armies joined near a place called Corbach. The allied army had fallen back from the po&s;t they occu|pied at Fritzlar, and were retreating towards the river Dymel. As yet they had received no advice of the dreaded junction of the French armies; but as it was imagined that the corps of St. Germain only moved that way, and the vanguard only of that corps could be arrived at Corbach, which could not be e&s;timated at more than 10,000 foot, and 17 &s;quadrons at the utmo&s;t, the Hereditary Prince formed a &s;ceme of attacking and driving them from that po&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had begun the attack, contrary to his expec|tation he found the enemy already formed; but it was now impo&s;&s;ible to recede. The action grew every moment more furious and bloody. The French &s;tood their ground with firmne&s;s, and the main army being extremely near, in&s;tead of being wa&s;ted in the action, they grew more nu|merous by the reinforcements that were continually &s;ent.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Prince &s;hould make as &s;peedy a retreat as po&s;&s;ible; but the difficulty of drawing out of the field in the middle of the day, before an enemy quite fre&s;h, and every in&s;tant reinforced, may be ea&s;ily imagined. To compleat this difficulty, &s;ome bodies of the German troops both hor&s;e and foot fell into great confu&s;ion. The enemy &s;aw it at the fir&s;t glance, and to increa&s;e it to the utmo&s;t di&s;order, pu&s;hed forward upon them with a numerous artillery and a large body of cavalry. The allied army &s;eemed to be in the way of inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>In this exigence the Hereditary Prince, as his la&s;t re|&s;ource, put him&s;elf at the head of a &s;quadron of Bland's and Howard's regiments of dragroons. By the&s;e the un|common
<PB N="283" REF="325">
heroi&s;m of their young leader was perfectly &s;e|conded. They charged the enemy with the utmo&s;t fury, &s;topped their career of their victorious hor&s;e; and enabled the alied battalions to make an undi&s;turbed retreat.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince was wounded in this action; about 900 men were killed, wounded, or pri&s;oners, fifteen pieces of cannon, the whole of the artillery, was left to the enemy, but &s;till in their circum&s;tances to have avoided a total defeat, was in &s;ome &s;ort victory. The well-timed impetuo&s;ity of the Hereditary Prince, and the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e, could not be too highly prai&s;ed. The Prince retired to the main army of the allies, who had now po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;trong po&s;t of Saxenhau&s;en: whil&s;t the French continued oppo&s;ite to them in the no le&s;s &s;trong po&s;t of Corbach, which they had acquired by their victory; and here for &s;ome time they watched each other.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince &s;uffered more by this check than from the wounds he had received. His mind, forgetful of his pain and weakne&s;s, only brooding over his defeat, &s;eek|ing out with anxiety an opportunity of revenging his lo&s;s by &s;ome bold, &s;ignal, and unexpected &s;troke again&s;t the enemy. It was not long before an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Advice had been received, that among the detachments which the French employed to reduce tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es which the allies had garri&s;oned on their retreat, there was one very con&s;iderable, formed of French and Saxon, under Mon&s;. Glaubitz, moving towards Zigenhagen, a place of importance in the landgrave of He&s;&s;e. The Hereditary Prince undertook to relieve it, and for that pur|po&s;e &s;elected &s;ix battalions of the German troops,

 <MILESTONE N="14 July."> 

 two brigades of hunters, a regiment of hu&s;&s;ars, and Eliot's light dragoons. Although this la&s;t corps was but ju&s;t arrived, had been newly rai&s;ed, and had never &s;een any kind of &s;ervice, the Prince was &s;o well plea&s;ed with their countenance, that he cho&s;e them preferably to all other for his difficult enterprize, and the event proved that he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Glaubitz remained in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity; he was under no &s;ort of apprehen&s;ion of being mole&s;ted by a detachment of an army &s;ixty miles di&s;tance, under the eye, and as it were, guard of a &s;uperior body which

 when on a &s;udden he found him&s;elf attacked with the utmo&s;t violence&punc; The Hereditary Prince having reconnoitred hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;ition, made a detour of two leagues through woods and mountains, fell upon his left, whil&s;t the re&s;t of his troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> climbed the mountains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and ru&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the &s;ame &s;pirit upon the right.</P>
<P>Glaubitz had &s;carce time to form his troops; and they were only formed to be immediately broken. They retired with precipitation, leaving their camp and all it contained to the enemy. The Prince had &s;o di&s;po&s;ed his cavalry as to cut off the retreat of &s;ome; but the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part gained ground upon him. On this occa&s;ion he relied entirely on Elliot's hor&s;e, as it was altogether impo&s;&s;ible for the infantry, already hara&s;&s;ed by the action, and a mo&s;t fatiguing forced march of two days, to follow them. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the head of this hor&s;e he overtook the fugitives as they came out of a wood, charged and broke them five different times, &s;eperated a body of 500 from the re&s;t, &s;urrounded them, and obliged them to throw down their arms. Hav|ing routed this, with the like rapidity, he flew to another body who had taken po&s;t near a wood, &s;urrounded them in the &s;ame manner; &s;ummoned and received them all pri&s;o|ners of war. A regiment of the enemy's hu&s;&s;ars was en|tirely cut to pieces. Nothing was wanting to compleat his victory. Elliot's light hor&s;e, proud to be led on by the Prince him&s;elf, and worthy of that honour, had the greate&s;t &s;hare of the glory and &s;ufferings of that day. So young a corps had never &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf. No more than 79 of the allies were killed in this action, but of the&s;e 71 were of this &s;ingle regiment.</P>
<P>The numbers of the enemy killed is not known, but for a time the &s;laughter was terrible. General Glaubitz him&s;elf was made pri&s;oner, together with the Prince of Anhalt. There were be&s;ides 177 officers, and 2482 private men. A greater number of pri&s;oners could &s;carely be expected from a victory in a general engagement. The trophies were nine pair of colours and &s;ix pieces of cannon. In all the <HI>Petite Gurre</HI> of this campaign, (and the campaign be|tween the French and the allies was almo&s;t wholly made up of &s;uch,) this was by far the mo&s;t billiant action; and alone might have e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of the Hereditary Prince, if any thing had been wanting to e&s;tabli&s;h him the

fir&s;t man of his age, in that &s;pecies of war. He returned to the camp of Saxenhau&s;en, without mole&s;tation, having fully revenged the affair of Corbach.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand did not remain long after this action in his camp at Saxenhau&s;en. By &s;o advanced a po&s;ition, the landgraviate, and even Hanover, lay too open to the enemies incur&s;ions. He therefore took his camp at a place called Kalle, in a &s;ituation nearer to Ca&s;&s;el On this M. Broglio formed a plan, which the greatne&s;s of his army in &s;ome &s;ort enabled him to execute. The Chevalier de Muy, who commanded in the room of the Count St. Germain, was ordered to cro&s;s the Dymel at Statbergen, with his re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of 35,000 men, in order to cut off the allies from their communication with We&s;tphalia. Whil&s;t the re&s;t of the French, dividing them&s;elves into two bodies, moved, the main army under M. Broglio towards Duke Ferdinand's camp at Kalle, the re&s;erve under Prince Xavier of Saxony towards Ca&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The&s;e important movements obliged Prince Ferdinand to &s;et him&s;elf al&s;o in motion; and as he was not in a condition to make detachments of &s;ufficient &s;trength, he cro&s;&s;ed the Dymel with his grand army, in order to fight the Chevalier de Muy.</P>
<P>His Serene Highne&s;s formed his main body on the heights of Corbach,

 <MILESTONE N="31 July."> 

 and moved towards the enemy, who were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted near Warbourg; in the mean time the Hereditary Prince with two columns wheeled round the enemy's left, and began a vigorous at|tack at once upon that flank, and upon their rear. The French commander poured reinforcements on that quarter. An hot engagement was there maintained with equal ob&s;ti|nacy for near four hours. Whil&s;t this combat continued with uncertain fortune on the left, Prince Ferdinand cau&s;ed &s;ome bodies to file off towards the French bridges on the Dymel to their right, by which he propo&s;ed to attack al&s;o on that &s;ide, and intercept them on their retreat; at the &s;ame time the main of his army advanced with the utmo&s;t expedition to charge the enemy in front.</P>
<P>The French now &s;aw them&s;elves in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being &s;urrounded. Already their left, attacked in flank and rear by the Hereditary Prince, began to give way: his fire became every moment &s;uperior; and the ear|lie&s;t retreat was the &s;afe&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="328">As &s;oon as Prince Ferdinand perceived the enemy to tire, he &s;aw it ab&s;olutely in vain to think of bringing infantry upon their front.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the time that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia found him&s;elf compelled to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Dre&s;den, it was evident that he could have no hopes of acting in Saxony to any good purpo&s;e. The bu&s;y part of the campaign came on fa&s;t. Though Prince Henry had obliged Laudohn to retire from Bre&s;law; that general, able, and lately victorious, was &s;till formidable; he kept Nei&s;&s;e and Schweidnitz blocked up; and wanted to effect a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians, by which he propo&s;ed to give the final blow to the king's power in Sile&s;ia, The Ru&s;&s;ians had now actually arrived in the fron|tier parts of that province, and wanted but a very few days ea&s;y march to compleat that fatal and long dreaded junction. At the &s;ame time another body of Ru&s;&s;ians had penetrated into Pomerania; laid all the defencele&s;s parts under con|tribution, and threatened the &s;iege of Colberg: The Swedi&s;h army, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 22,000 men, commenced al&s;o, tho' with le&s;s vigour, their operations. In all that country the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had not 5000 men to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances a plan of mere defence would have proved altogether without effect. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had but two armies; and it was nece&s;&s;ary that one of them, at lea&s;t, &s;hould make the mo&s;t rapid and &s;udden movements to oppo&s;e &s;o many combinations. On the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia the danger &s;eemed more pre&s;&s;ing, and accordingly he marched to its relief;

 <MILESTONE N="July 30."> 

 advanced near two hundred miles, and left Mar&s;hal Daun, who had con&s;ider|ably the &s;tart, far behind him. This march would have been thought an a&s;toni&s;hing exploit in a partizan at the head of a &s;mall and di&s;encumbered corps; but that a nume|rous army clogged with its artillery, with above two thou|&s;and waggons, &s;hould in that time traver&s;e &s;uch a &s;pace,

&s;hould pa&s;s the Elbe, the Spree, the Nei&s;&s;e, the Quei&s;s, and the Bober, five con&s;iderable rivers; that they &s;hould effect all this, with one army of the enemy on one &s;ide of it flanks, another behind, and with a third in its front (th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> actual po&s;ition of the Au&s;trians in Lu&s;atia) was an actio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;erved for, and only to be expected from the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pru&s;&s;ia.

To en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s beyond doubt, it was determined that this attempt &s;hould be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by &s;urprize, and therefore in the night. M. Daun reme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+bered the bad guard which had been kept by the Pru&s;&s;ians and the advantage, which in the year 1758 he derived fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a night attack at the battle of Hochkirchen.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this plan the whole army, as &s;oon as &s;hould begin to grow dark, was to march from their &s;even po&s;ts to &s;uch &s;ituation as were marked out for each corps they were to &s;trike their tents, but yet to keep up the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="295" REF="337">
in their camps, and to have the drums beat the tattoo as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Some time after Mar&s;hal Daun had begun to move, to his a&s;toni&s;hment the patroles he had &s;ent out returned with the account, that they had met no out-po&s;ts. As &s;oon as day broke and the army had advanced, their apprehen&s;ions were confirmed. They were di&s;appointed in their de&s;ign, there was no enemy in the camp; but when they ca&s;t their eyes from thence, they could perceive at a di&s;tance the ri&s;ing of a thick &s;moke, which left them no room to doubt that their fortune was then on the point of deci&s;ion, by a part of their forces only, and that the King and Baron Laudohn were at that moment hotly engaged; Daun could only look on and wait the event.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July the king was in his camp at Lignitz, when he received advice that the Ru&s;&s;ian army of 24,000 men, under Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder, at a place called Auras, and that they were to pa&s;s the river on that very day. He &s;u&s;pected al&s;o, that the enemy had formed the de&s;ign of a general attack. Troops which have been a long time oppo&s;ed to each other can reciprocally gue&s;s at each other's de&s;igns; the method u&s;ed by the enemies generals grow familiar, and the lea&s;t motion they make di&s;clo&s;es their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This is the account the Pru&s;&s;ians gave of the means by which they came to a knowledge of M. Daun's projects. The Au&s;trians attributed this di&s;covery, not to the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;agacity, but to intelligence given by de&s;erters.</P>
<P>Whatever the means were by which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia became &s;u&s;picious of this de&s;ign, it is certain, that he took the mo&s;t early, the mo&s;t vigorous, and the mo&s;t effective mea|&s;ures to defeat it. He was thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the danger he ran of being &s;urrounded, if he continued in his po&s;t at Lignitz; out of that very de&s;ign, which was calculated for his ruin, his genius drew a new means of &s;afety. He &s;aw at a glance, that the plan which the enemy had formed to &s;urround him, at the &s;ame time, nece&s;&s;arily divided their own armies. And this divi&s;ion was the great object he had pur&s;ued &s;o long, and thro' &s;uch di&s;couraging di&s;appoint|ments. His only bu&s;ine&s;s was to prevent their reuniting in a general attack upon his quarters. Therefore in the very evening calculated for the attempt on his camp, he quitted it with as much privacy as the enemy had propo&s;ed to attack

 the &s;urprize he intend+ed was turned upon him&s;elf. But this able gene+ral, though &s;urpri&s;ed, was not di&s;ordered. The be&s;t di&s;po+&s;itions were made that the time would admit; a &s;harp an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;tinate combat began; which continued without giving

way on either &s;ide, until &s;ix. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia exerted him&s;elf with incredible diligence to pre&s;erve an uniform &s;trength in every part of his line, and hazarded his own life with a daring, which nothing but his &s;ituation could excu&s;e from temerity. His cloaths were &s;hot through in &s;everal places, his hor&s;e was killed under him. But all the&s;e trou|bles and dangers were fully compen&s;ated by the efforts of his troops, who maintained &s;o &s;teady a fire, and pu&s;hed the Au&s;trians with &s;o much ardour, that they at la&s;t gave ground, and retreated with precipitation, though not with|out &s;ome order, towards the Kat&s;bach.</P>
<P>The king pur&s;ued them to this river, and no further. His advantage as it was gained by the mo&s;t vigorous &s;teps, &s;o bounds were &s;et to the ardour of improving it with the mo&s;t guarded caution. He feared if he pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;s too far, it might disjoin the part of the army en|gaged from that which he had left to ob&s;erve M. Daun; and perhaps give that general an opportunity of taking a &s;evere revenge on the right, for the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the left. Notwith&s;tanding this re&s;erve of the king, (a re&s;erve, the want of which was formerly the only failing in his mi|litary character, but which his misfortunes had now per|fectly taught him,) notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ay he did not pu&s;h his good fortune again&s;t Baron Laudohn to the utmo&s;t, the victory was compleat, glorious, and adorned with all the trophies. By their own confe&s;&s;ion, the Au&s;trians lo&s;t upwards of 6000 men, killed, wounded and pri&s;oners. The Pru&s;&s;ians made it amount, and not without proba|bility to 10,000. Among the pri&s;oners, were two gene|rals, and 84 officers; 82 pieces of cannon and 23 pair of colours were taken. On the &s;ide of the conquerors, five hundred were killed, and 1200 wounded.</P>
<P>With regard to Sile&s;ia, the victory near Lignitz produced &s;ome mo&s;t immediate, and mo&s;t u&s;eful effects. Although M. Daun, not di&s;pirited with his late mi&s;adventure, and only &s;ollicitous to repair his lo&s;s, had detached a &s;trong corps under Prince Lowen&s;tein, and Gen. Beck to &s;trengthen the Ru&s;&s;ians and encourage them to advance. Count Czerni|chew was &s;o intimidated with the late defeat of the Au&s;tri|ans, that he repa&s;&s;ed the Oder by the &s;ame bridges on which he had lately cro&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Thus one great end of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march was obtained. He prevented the dreaded junction of tho&s;e two
<PB N="298" REF="340">
powers. In the other part of his de&s;ign, he did not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> perfectly &s;ucceed. M. Daun &s;ince the action of P&s;affendorf could indeed make no progre&s;s in Sile&s;ia; but on the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+hand, the king was not able entirely to drive him out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that province. The Au&s;trians even after their defeat, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uperior to the king, had been be&s;ides largely reinforced The empre&s;s exerted all her power, to remove the ill effec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this late check might have had on the reputation of her arms at the &s;ame time that &s;he augmented her troops, &s;he com|forted and encouraged Baron Laudohn, and by a very gene+rous and gracious letter let him &s;ee, that &s;he was not a &s;ove+reign, in who&s;e mind a late misfortune cancels the memory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;t &s;ervices.

<P>The king after this victory joined his brother Prince Henry at Newmarcke. One part of that Prince's army under General Goltze had pa&s;&s;ed the Oder to ob&s;erve the Ru&s;&s;ians, who &s;ince the repa&s;&s;ing that river, &s;eemed to direc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their motions northward. The king being &s;trengthened by this junction, and having his communication with Bre&s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> clear, marched again&s;t Daun, who had begun to form the blockade of Schweidnitz, fell upon a corps under General Beck; made two battalions of Croats pri&s;oners, di&s;per&s;ed &s;everal &s;quadrons, and by this lively affair obliged the enemy&punc; grand army to rai&s;e the blockade, and by a precipitate re|treat, to take refuge in the mountains of Land&s;hut.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his maje&s;ty was thus exerting the mo&s;t heroic ef|forts in defence of Sile&s;ia; Gen. Hul&s;en, who commanded for him in Saxony, &s;econded his endeavours in that quarter with uncommon bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. The army of the empire had formed a de&s;ign of cutting him off from Tor|gau. To fru&s;trate their intentions, that general quitted his camp at Mei&s;&s;en, and marched to Strehla. The enemy divided into two bodies; one attacked an advanced po&s;t about a cannon &s;hot from his camp upon every &s;ide, with the greate&s;t fury from, day break to &s;ix in the morning,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 20."> 

 whil&s;t another corps was &s;o placed as to keep his camp in awe, and to prevent his

attempting any thing for the relief of the advanced po&s;t. Gen Hul&s;en &s;aw that unle&s;s he could &s;peedily do &s;omething for its &s;uccour, that body mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. He there|fore in this exigency, gave orders to his cavalry to make a circuit round an height; and to charge if po&s;&s;ible the ene|mies flank. This order was executed with the utmo&s;t promptitude and &s;pirit. The Imperiali&s;ts were charged on their flanks; their battalions and hor&s;e were thrown upon one another in confu&s;ion, and 41 officers and 1200 men were made pri&s;oners, The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians was incon|&s;iderable. Gen. Hul&s;en by this advantage, was enabled to encamp under To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gau, while he retreated through an ap|prehen&s;ion, as the grand army of the Imperiali&s;ts was com|ing up, that he might be cut off from his communication with the Elbe. This retreat made the Au&s;trians magnify the affair into a victory on their &s;ide; but the circum&s;tances render the Pru&s;&s;ian account much more probable.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed once more to have &s;miled, after a long interval of gloom on the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs; and the reputation of his arms began to revive. But the victories he obtained, though glorious, were deci&s;ive of little more than the field upon which they were fought. They were far from having lowered the power of the enemy to an equality with his. And the movements he made to gain tho&s;e advantages, and to protect one part of his dominions nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed the re&s;t. The enemy was able to de|tach without end; and whil&s;t bodies of Ru&s;&s;ians traver&s;ed the Lower Sile&s;ia, &s;everal corps of Au&s;trians &s;coured Lu&s;a|tia; and thus together they broke off all regular commu|nication between the king's army and his hereditary domi|nions, and of cour&s;e between him and his general Hul&s;en, who with very unequal forces was &s;truggling to &s;ecure Saxony; a country in which there are towns indeed forti|fied; but fortified for the greater part in &s;uch a manner, as to be little more than &s;nares for increa&s;ing the number of pri&s;oners, by betraying defencele&s;s garri&s;ons into the hands of an enemy &s;uperior in the field.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the king is &s;aid to have wrote a letter to the celebrated

<P>The Hereditary Prince who was ever in motion, continually hovering now on one &s;ide, now on the other, the French camp, in one of his excur&s;ions had perceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the French, according to their u&s;ual negligence, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not very exact in their out-po&s;ts and patrols.

 they divided into three bodies, which took three differ|ent routs, by which the place was compleatly &s;urrounded. At eight in the evening, they &s;et out from Warbourg, and came before this place at two the following morning. Not|with&s;tanding the precautions taken, the trampling of the troops over the gardens gave the alarm to a guard of the enemies dragoons, who immediately began to fire. Strict orders had been given to proceed with as little alarm as po&s;&s;ible, and to re&s;erve their fire; and &s;uch was the delibe|rate courage, &s;uch the perfect di&s;cipline of the Engli&s;h gre|nadiers, that they &s;u&s;tained this fire, pu&s;hed on with bayo|nets, drove back the enemies piquets, killed the guard at the gate, and entered the town along with the fugitives, without the lea&s;t noi&s;e, hurry, or confu&s;ion.

<P>The column of the Engli&s;h grenadiers having forced the gate, advanced regularly with their bayonets fixed, and without firing a mu&s;quet, by the two &s;treets that led to the church-yard, (which being the only open part of the town, &s;erved the French as a place of arms,) killing or taking a great number of tho&s;e who ran from the hou&s;es towards this rendezvous; and thus they advanced with the greate&s;t order and the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, until they reached the church-yard.

<P>Two regiments of the enemies dragoons endeavoured to fly to the gate that led to their camp; but they found it, oc|cupied by 400 grenadiers, who drove them back with their bayonets; forced from hence, they fled to another gate; there they were repul&s;ed with a &s;harp fire of &s;mall arms.

precarious the French communication with the Rhine and Maine, from whence they drew the greate&s;t part of their &s;upplies of all kinds.</P>
<P>With this intention, he detached general Bulow at the head of a &s;trong corps, who pu&s;hed forward towards Mar|purg, &s;urprized the town, de&s;troyed the French ovens, with &s;everal hundred waggons of flour, and carried off a con&s;iderable quantity of cloathing and military &s;tores. In the mean time, his light troops &s;coured the country in &s;uch a manner as for a while an&s;wered the great end of the ex|pedition in breaking the French communication with Frankfort. Proceeding on this plan he made a further movement towards Frankenau, which, at length, nece&s;&s;i|tated the French general Stainville, who commanded in tho&s;e parts, to quit his po&s;ition, and endeavour to &s;top the progre&s;s of this detachment. He came up with their rear as they were pa&s;&s;ing the river Orche,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 13."> 

 and falling upon them at this di&s;advantage with &s;uperior numbers and great fury, he entirely routed the rear; and took &s;ome men and a very great number of hor&s;es.</P>
<P>It was to be apprehended that he might have pur&s;ued this advantage, to the entire ruin of M. Bulow's detachment; if the Hereditary Prince by a forced march of five German miles had not arrived time enough to &s;upport him. On the prince's arrival M. Stainville fell back, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong po&s;t in which it was in vain to attack him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e mea&s;ures were taking with mixed &s;ucce&s;s for di&s;quieting the French, and interrupting their commu|nication to the &s;outhward of their quarters, like movements were made to the northward, to oblige them, if po&s;&s;ible, to relinqui&s;h their hold on Gottingen. But General Wan|genheim, who with that de&s;ign had cro&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and in the beginning had proceeded with no &s;mall expecta|tions; but at length he received a &s;evere check, which forced him to repa&s;s the river with &s;ome precipitation.

and that O&s;tend, which the Empre&s;s &s;o unpolitically for her&s;elf, and &s;o ungratefully to her former friends, had given into the hands of France, would be the fir&s;t object of tho&s;e forces which were to unite from &s;uch a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign of the expedition from Port&s;mouth has, we under&s;tand, been formerly di&s;avowed. Whether in &s;trict|ne&s;s, not being a principal in the war, with her imperial maje&s;ty, England ought to have made &s;uch an attempt, though O&s;tend was defended by a French garri&s;on, we &s;hall not take upon us to determine; but without the aid of &s;uch con&s;iderations, it is evident there were &s;uffi|cient objections to it from the &s;ide of mere prudence. Almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties occurred in &s;uch a &s;cheme; and it would &s;carcely appear to mo&s;t men advi&s;eable to add a Flemi&s;h to our German war.</P>
<P>But we think it po&s;&s;ible to give &s;ome rea&s;onable account of the expedition of the Hereditary Prince, independent of any connection with the Briti&s;h armament. For a con&s;ide|rable time the French had &s;eemed re&s;olved to re&s;ume their former plan of an army on the Lower Rhine; &s;uch motions were made as &s;trongly indicated that this de&s;ign would &s;hort|ly be put in execution; and the allied army had every thing to fear from it. For as the French were checked from proceeding to the compleat conque&s;t of the electorate by the allied, army on the Dymel, if this army &s;hould it&s;elf be &s;o checked, by one of the enemy advancing from the Lower Rhine, there would be then nothing to hinder M. Broglio from &s;ending forward &s;o &s;trong a re&s;erve as might finally reduce Hanover. In the&s;e circum&s;tances nothing but a very deci&s;ive victory could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave the allied ar|my, thus &s;urrounded and deprived of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, from peri&s;hing in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, or &s;urrendering in the mo&s;t &s;hameful manner.</P>
<P>There was one &s;tep only which might with certainty pre|vent this de&s;ign, and even in &s;ome mea&s;ure turn it upon the enemy; the taking Cleves and We&s;el into the hands of the allies. This would not only defeat the &s;cheme of the French for acting on the Lower Rhine, but greatly em|barra&s;s their operations in every other quarter. Even the attempt, though it &s;hould not be attempted with &s;ucce&s;s, would nece&s;&s;arily draw the attention of the French that way, and thus &s;ave Hanover at lea&s;t for one campaign. This alone had been a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the march. But
<PB N="308" REF="352">
had the Briti&s;h armament at the &s;ame time been intende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;ome part of the coa&s;t of France, or had England poli|tically kept up &s;uch a rumour, when &s;he had in reality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more remote object for her armament; in either of the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;es it would undoubtedly have co-operated with the He|reditary Prince's de&s;igns, by detaining a greater body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the French troops at home to defend their own coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to penetrate into all the motives But it is evident, that in the German enterpri&s;e every thing depended on the celerity of the operations. The &s;iege o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> We&s;el was carried on with great vigour, by that part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the prince's army which was on the right of the Rhine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whil&s;t the prince covered it on the left. But before the enemy could di&s;turb him, nature declared again&s;t his &s;uc|ce&s;s by the fall of immen&s;e rains, which &s;welled the Rhine and Lippe to &s;uch a degree as greatly interrupted the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;iege, having rendered the roads of We&s;tphalia impa&s;&s;able, and therefore prevented the arrival of the&s;e reinforcements which were intended to pu&s;h the &s;iege with the greater effect. The&s;e rains al&s;o made it very difficult for the prince to pre&s;erve his communication with the be|&s;iegers, which however he made a &s;hift to keep open by one bridge above and another below the town,</P>
<P>In the mean time, the French with all the expedition they could u&s;e, had collected an army under M. de Ca&s;trie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of thirty battalions and thirty-eight &s;quadrons, partly from the great army in He&s;&s;e, partly from the Low Countries. This body advanced as far as Rheinberg, and after a &s;trenu|ous re&s;i&s;tance drove out a detachment of the allies which had been po&s;ted there. From thence they marched by their left, and encamped behind the convent of Campen. The Hereditary Prince now &s;aw at the &s;ame time the &s;ea|&s;on and a &s;uperior army acting again&s;t him, to fight this enemy, fully prepared to receive him, with the troops which he could &s;pare from the &s;iege, might be a de&s;perate attempt. To break up the &s;iege would have of it&s;elf an|&s;wered the intention of the enemies march. There was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> medium but a &s;urprize; which was re&s;olved, and all the di&s;po&s;itions for it made with the judgment by which the great prince who commanded is di&s;tingui&s;hed upon &s;uch difficult occa&s;ions. This attempt became the more nece&s;&s;ary, and the le&s;s time was to be lo&s;t in making it, as intelligence had been received that the French army was &s;hortly to be
<PB N="309" REF="353">
augmented by powerful reinforcements. The prince be|gan his march at ten in the evening.</P>
<P>To reach the enemy's camp, it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge Fi&s;cher's corps of irregulars, who had occupied the con|vent of Campen in their front. This produced &s;ome &s;hot,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 16."> 

 and this &s;hot alarmed the whole French army, which immediately got under arms and po&s;ted them&s;elves in a wood. The allied troops pu&s;hed forward, twice repul&s;ed the French, and with the mo&s;t noble per&s;everance reiterated their attacks on the wood, and kept up a terrible and well &s;upplied fire for &s;ixteen hours without intermi&s;&s;ion, that is from five in the morn|ing to the &s;ame evening at nine. There have been few ex|amples of &s;o ob&s;tinate a combat. But at length finding night approach, the troops harra&s;&s;ed, their ammunition &s;pent, and all hopes vain of di&s;lodging a &s;uperior enemy from an advantageous po&s;t, the Hereditary Prince having had an hor&s;e killed under him, and being him&s;elf wound|ed, was with regret compelled to retire. Eleven hundred and &s;eventy of the allies were killed and wounded in this bloody action; about 500 were made pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the French was far greater but they had the field.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, the Engli&s;h nation regretted the lo&s;s of one of its mo&s;t &s;hining ornaments in the death of Lord Downe, who whil&s;t his grateful &s;overeign was di&s;tining him to higher honours, received a mortal wound in this battle. He was a per&s;on of free and plea&s;urable life: but of an ex|cellent under&s;tanding, amiable manners, and the mo&s;t in|trepid courage. In the beginning of this war he had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in rou&s;ing a martial &s;pirit among&s;t the young people of rank in England, and having long &s;hewed them by a gallant example how to fight, he at la&s;t by a melancholy one, &s;hewed them how to die for their country.</P>
<P>As the briti&s;h troops had been the greate&s;t &s;ufferers in this as well as in mo&s;t other actions of the campaign, great murmers were rai&s;ed again&s;t the commander of the allied army, as if upon all occa&s;ions, even the mo&s;t trivial, he had wantonly expo&s;ed the lives of the Briti&s;h, in order to pre&s;erve tho&s;e of the German &s;oldiery. Some carried this complaint to a ridiculous length. But could it with rea&s;on have been expected, that where 25,000 Engli&s;h had &s;erved for a whole campaign, were engaged in five &s;harp encoun|ters (&s;ome of them a &s;ort of pitched battles) in all which

engaged by an event of the greate&s;t importance, and which many were of opinion would make no &s;mall change in the nature of the war, and above all in the general &s;y&s;tem of pacification. This was the death of George II. king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>He died &s;uddenly in his palace at Ken&s;ington in the 77th year of his age and 33d of his reign. The immediate cau&s;e of his death was the rupture of the &s;ub&s;tance of the right ventricle of his heart, by which the circulation was &s;top|ped in an in&s;tant. This was preceded by no &s;ort of appa|rent illne&s;s. His maje&s;ty enjoyed an uncommon degree of health and &s;trength for that age; but it was believed that he had &s;uffered, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf too much to the cold, in reviewing &s;ome troops that were to be embarked for the expedition. He had been extremely &s;olicitous about the fortune of this expedition. He had been no le&s;s anxious for the fate of the enterpri&s;e under the Hereditary Prince, an account of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of which he had received, tho' it was not at that time made public. This was believed to have touched him deeply, and to have been one of the cau&s;es of a death &s;o afflicting to all his people.</P>
<P>When future hi&s;torians come to &s;peak of his late maje&s;ty, they will find both in his fortune and his virtue, abundant matter for ju&s;t and un&s;u&s;pected panegyric.

and we do not hazard any thing in a&s;&s;erting, that if it had not been for the prudent fore&s;ight of that mea&s;ure, the army which has &s;ince been formed, and the great things which have &s;ince been done, could never have had exi&s;t|ence. So that if we only examine what he has done in Germany, when we reflect what enemies &s;ecret and de|clared he had at different times to manage and to fight in that country, he mu&s;t in every fair judgment be allowed the greate&s;t prince of his family.</P>

<P>He was plain and direct in his intentions; true to his word; &s;teady in his favour and protection to his &s;ervants, and never changed them willingly; this appeared clearly in tho&s;e who &s;erved more immediately on his per&s;on, whom he &s;carce ever removed; but they grew old along with him, or died in their places. But having been in a &s;ort compelled by a violent faction, to relinqui&s;h a mini&s;ter for whom he had great affection, and in whom he repo&s;ed an unlimited confidence, it afterwards became a matter of more indifference to him by whom he was &s;erved in the affairs of his government.</P>
<P>He was merciful in his di&s;po&s;ition, but not to &s;uch a de|gree as in any &s;ort to encourage offences again&s;t his go|vernment. On the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion in 1746, he behaved without any remarkable di&s;play either of &s;eve|rity or clemency. Many were pardoned, many puni&s;hed; and this perhaps, is the mo&s;t proper conduct on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, where offended maje&s;ty requires victims, ju&s;tice examples, and humanity pardons.

<P>As he came into England in a riper age, and of con&s;e|quence never had been able to attain a perfect knowledge of the force and beauties of our language, he never &s;hewed a &s;ufficient regard to the Engli&s;h literature, which in his reign did not flouri&s;h: and this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the

<P>Berlin is compo&s;ed of five towns, which have &s;tretched to each other and grown into one va&s;t city upon the banks of the river Spree. It has been augmented to this gran|deur, by having long been the re&s;idence of the electors of Brandenburg and kings of Pru&s;&s;ia, who as they have en|larged
<PB N="317" REF="361">
their dominions by inheritance, force, or policy, have all contributed &s;omething to the grandeur and mag|nificence of this their capital. The &s;ituation of the town on &s;o noble and navigable a river as the Spree, communi|cating on one &s;ide with the Oder, by a canal (the mo&s;t princely work of her &s;overeigns) and on the other falling into the Elbe, has added not a little to its extent and opu|lence; but that which has contributed mo&s;t of all, has been the reception of the French refugees, to which this city has always been a mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured and favourable a&s;ylum, as it has al&s;o been to tho&s;e prote&s;tants who have been per&s;ecuted in any part of Germany; and the pre&s;ent king by enlarging his plan, and imparting an extent of toleration unknown to his predece&s;&s;ors, has al&s;o introduced Roman Catholics, whom he has encouraged by &s;uffering them to build a mo&s;t magnificent church in the heart of Berlin. By this means he has brought the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite factions to concur in pro|moting the grandeur of his royal re&s;idence. From the&s;e cau&s;es Berlin is become one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Europe; va&s;t in its extent; con&s;iderable in its commerce, and magnificent beyond mo&s;t others in its public and private buildings, and the regular di&s;tribution of the &s;treets in the new town. It had long been the &s;eat of the greate&s;t mili|tary arrangements in the world; and it was made by the pre&s;ent king the &s;eat of arts and &s;ciences, and the place of re&s;ort of ingenious men, in every &s;cience, in every art, and from every quarter.</P>
<P>Such is Berlin, which at this time being de&s;erted by the greate&s;t part of its garri&s;on, was abandoned to the mercy of a mighty army of Au&s;trians, Ru&s;&s;ians, Saxons and Imperia|li&s;ts, animated by revenge; exa&s;perated by injuries; and in|&s;tigated by avarice. Nothing could exceed the terror and con&s;ternation of the inhabitants on this occa&s;ion. They were acquainted with the &s;avage character of one part of the enemy, and with the violent animo&s;ity of the re&s;t; and they knew that they did not want pretences for colouring their &s;everities, with the appearance of a ju&s;t retaliation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of the inhabitants, the enemy ap|poached. The garri&s;on immediately propo&s;ed to capitu|late. With re&s;pect to them, the terms were &s;hort; they were made pri&s;oners of war. But with regard to the inha|bitants, where the great danger lay, the conditions were more tolerable than they expected; they were promi&s;ed

We have abundant rea&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect the exact veracity of many pieces of that nature which have been publi&s;hed on all &s;ides; and which are but too fre|quently a &s;ort of &s;tate libels&punc; where the powers at war, not content to de&s;troy each other in the field, pur&s;ue their ad|ver&s;aries reputation, and endeavour mutually to paint each other as mon&s;ters equally devoid of ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion. Indeed if we were to give credit to all the writings of this kind that have appeared, it were hard to &s;ay which of the parties have by their conduct brought the greate&s;t di&s;grace upon human nature. It is, however, certain, that the country of Brandenburg &s;uffered more &s;everely on this oc|ca&s;ion than the city of Berlin. An ill di&s;ciplined army is always mo&s;t furious in its retreat, and the country had made no conditions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE King of Pru&s;&s;ia at la&s;t &s;aw his capital taken by his mo&s;t cruel enemies, and put to ran&s;om; his native country was wa&s;ted; they took up their quarters in his pa|laces: but this was far from the whole of his misfortunes. When Gen. Hul&s;en marched to cover Brandenburg, there remained no Pru&s;&s;ian army in Saxony. So that the Impe|rial army on their return from Berlin, within a &s;hort time, and with little oppo&s;ition, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Leip|&s;ick,

encamped within reach of Torgau, one part of his army extending to the Elbe, by which he was covered on that &s;ide, and whil&s;t he was protected on every other quarter by ponds, hills, and woods, it was impo&s;&s;ible to chu&s;e a more advantageous &s;ituation, in which above 80,000 men were po&s;ted with every precaution that could be taken by a weak army in the mo&s;t unlucky po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was extremely &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trength, the advantageous po&s;ture, and the precautions of M.

<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was re&s;olved to come to a bat|tle. He cau&s;ed his army to be informed that he was to lead them to a mo&s;t de&s;perate attempt, that his affairs required it, and that he was determined to conquer or die in the ex|pected engagement. They unanimou&s;ly an&s;wered, that they would die along with him.</P>
<P>Animated by this declaration he began his march;

 <MILESTONE N="3d Nov."> 

 but having taken a re&s;olution as daring as could be dictated by de&s;pair, he made all the di&s;po&s;itions with as much &s;kill and care as could be &s;ugge&s;t|ed by the mo&s;t guarded prudence. He divided his army into three columns; General Hul&s;en with one was to take po&s;t in a wood that lay on the left of the Au&s;trian army, and had orders not to move until he found the re&s;t of the Pru&s;&s;ians engaged. General Ziethen was to charge on the right; the great attack in front was to be made by the king in per&s;on. The king had di&s;po&s;ed his force in &s;uch a man|ner, that either his right or left mu&s;t take the enemy in rear and clo&s;e them in, &s;o as to di&s;able them from under|taking any thing again&s;t the part where he intended to effect his principal attack. This was the king's di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>M. Daun as &s;oon as he perceived that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;erious in his re&s;olution of fighting, to prevent confu|&s;ion, &s;ent all his baggage over the Elbe, acro&s;s which he

<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition he was found, when about two o'clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the afternoon the king began his attack, and was recei+<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with the fire of two hundred pieces of cannon, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were di&s;po&s;ed along the Au&s;trian front.

vain to think of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, ordered a retreat, which was conducted in this darkne&s;s and acro&s;s the Elbe with wonderful order; none were lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing the bridges, and far the greater part of their artillery was pre&s;erved. The Pru&s;&s;ians remained ma&s;ters of this well-fought and bloody field. The darkne&s;s hindered them from mole&s;ting the enemies retreat or improving their victory, which they bought at the expence of ten thou&s;and killed and wounded, and about three thou&s;and pri&s;oners. But even with this lo&s;s, the advantage was well purcha&s;ed: it was a nece&s;&s;ary and a glorious victory. It re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of their arms; it &s;ecured their winter-quarters; and gave them again the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of Saxony.</P>
<P>Probably of all the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's battles, this was the mo&s;t important; and it was that in the conduct of which he &s;hewed the greate&s;t &s;kill, intrepidity, and per&s;everance. His troops behaved with a firmne&s;s which would have done honour to tho&s;e which he formerly led into Bohemia. In this action where they were to &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle and encounter every difficulty and danger in order to attack &s;o great and excellent an army as the Au&s;trian, under &s;uch an accompli&s;hed commander as M. Daun, their number did not exceed fifty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Au&s;trians was very great; the number killed and wounded is not indeed accurately known. Pro|bably it did not much, if at all exceed the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the victorious army; but the pri&s;oners were far more numerous, two hundred and &s;ixteen officers of the Au&s;tri|ans were taken, among whom were four generals, together with eight thou&s;and of the common &s;ort. The king in this battle, in which he every moment expo&s;ed his life to the greate&s;t dangers, received a &s;light contu&s;ion in his brea&s;t by a mu&s;ket &s;hot.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians di&s;puted the victory in the Gazettes. But the King of Pru&s;&s;ia reaped all the fruits of it; he recovered all Saxony except Dre&s;den; it had been the extremity of ra&s;hne&s;s to have commenced the &s;iege of that place in the depth of winter, and in the &s;ight of an army &s;trongly po&s;ted, and which though it had been beaten continued after its de|feat, more numerous than his own. His troops had alrea|dy &s;u&s;tained fatigues almo&s;t beyond human &s;trength; and the mo&s;t prudent part now left was to permit them to en|joy a little repo&s;e; and in the interval of action to prepare,
<PB N="324" REF="368">
by employing the means his victory had put into his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for the arduous work of the en&s;uing campaign.</P>
<P>Indeed the face of the Pru&s;&s;ian affairs had been pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+giou&s;ly changed &s;ince the day in which their enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> entered Berlin.

<PB N="325" REF="369">
of the en&s;uing year, two millions of crowns, exclu&s;ive of the ordinary revenue, together with a va&s;t quantity of forage and provi&s;ion. From all the other parts of Mi&s;nia which he held he exacted in the &s;ame proportion. He compelled them al&s;o to &s;upply a va&s;t number of recruits; his demand was twenty thou&s;and; and though it be certain that they could not &s;upply &s;o many, yet he was enabled by the recruits furni&s;hed by Saxony alone, entirely to fill up the breaches which the battle of Torgau had made in his battalions. He drew al&s;o va&s;t re&s;ources from the dutchy of Mecklenburgh, which he taxed at &s;ome millions of crowns, an immen&s;e quantity of provi&s;ion, and a great number of recruits. The&s;e he in&s;i&s;ted either on receiving immediately, or that the duke &s;hould enter his troops into the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice. It is &s;aid that his maje&s;ty then made &s;ome &s;ort of treaty or compo&s;ition with the duke, who&s;e condition has been from the beginuing of the war, the wor&s;t that can be imagined. For his &s;ituation is &s;uch, ju&s;t behind the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and out of all po&s;&s;ibility of communication with the grand armies of his allies, that he cannot be benefited by any advantages which they acquire; on the contrary, he &s;uffers almo&s;t equally, whether the King of Pru&s;&s;ia be vic|torious or defeated; and his dominions mu&s;t furni&s;h the means of improving the king's victories, and repairing his lo&s;&s;es. If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has made a treaty with this Prince, there is no doubt that it is almo&s;t wholly in his maje&s;ty's favour, and that he has taken care that he &s;hall not draw much le&s;s profit from the Duke of Mecklenburgh as an ally, than he had derived from him as an enemy.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, with regard to extent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is much in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which he was left at the clo&s;ing the foregoing campaign; but in all other re&s;pects his condition is infinitely preferable. He had then indeed the &s;ame po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Saxony; but he clo&s;ed that campaign with the lo&s;s of two battles, de&s;tructive in them|&s;elves, and di&s;graceful in their circum&s;tances: he clo&s;ed this by a mo&s;t beneficial and mo&s;t glorious victory, by which the reputation of his arms, greatly tarni&s;hed, was re&s;tored to its former brightne&s;s, and which in its con&s;equences has given him as fair a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s as he can have, whil&s;t the alliance again&s;t him is not in the lea&s;t degree weakened by the falling off of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable member, or the abatement of the &s;malle&s;t degree Of their animo&s;ity.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the account &s;tands thus with regard to England; deeply embarked as &s;he has been in this Ger|man war, in her particular quarrel with France, &s;he has been carried along with an almo&s;t uninterrupted tide of &s;uc|ce&s;s. She has taken many of the French colonies; &s;he has de&s;troyed their navy and their trade, and having in&s;ulted the enemies coa&s;ts, has ruined an harbour which might one day prove very obnoxious to us. Then how &s;tands the ac|count in Germany? The French have been there frequent|ly defeated: Hanover has been recovered and protected: The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has been pre&s;erved &s;o long at lea&s;t from the rage of his enemies, and in general the liberty of Germany has been hitherto &s;ecured. So that if we have incurred a great expence, we have done by it infinitely more than France has done at an expence much greater than ours. For the advocates who declaim again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;eem to have forgot that the charge of the French army mu&s;t exceed ours, as the number of their troops to be paid, exceeds the difference between French and Engli&s;h pay. Tho&s;e on the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment in Germany, have at no time exceeded 25,000, and the re&s;t of the confederates &s;erve very nearly on the &s;ame terms with the French. Not to mention the &s;ub&s;idies &s;o greatly &s;upe|rior to ours, which that power pays to &s;tates from whom &s;he has not a &s;ingle regiment to augment her armies. Thus, although by our victories, France is relieved from the charge of her navy, and that of the defence of &s;ome of her mo&s;t con&s;iderable colonies, the German war alone has brought her finances to a di&s;tre&s;s of which the whole world has been witne&s;s. And nothing le&s;s could have happened; the expence however contracted was &s;till enormous; and the re&s;ource of every war, trade was almo&s;t wholly de|&s;troyed. In England, the expence was al&s;o undoubtedly great: but then, the old trade &s;till remained to &s;upply it, and new channels were opened. Had we lain by and tame|ly beheld Germany in part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the re&s;t compel|led to receive laws from France, the war there would &s;oon have been brought to an end; and France &s;trengthened by victory, by conque&s;t and alliance, would have the whole force and whole revenue of her mighty monarchy free to act again&s;t us alone.</P>

year, than the events which we have ju&s;t related. But to avoid breaking the thread of the more important events in Germany, we have re&s;erved it for this place.</P>
<P>The reader will remember, that in the French &s;cheme for invading the&s;e i&s;lands, (which was de&s;cribed as it then appeared to us in the 4th chapter of the annals of 1759,) a &s;mall &s;quadron was prepared at Dunkirk, under Mon&s;ieur Thurot, the de&s;tination of which mo&s;t people at that time imagined to have been for Scotland. But, it has &s;ince ap|peared, that this little &s;quadron was intended to make a di|ver&s;ion on the north coa&s;t of Ireland, whil&s;t the grand fleet under Mon&s;ieur de Conflans, made the principal de&s;cent in &s;ome of the &s;outhern parts of that kingdom. The manner in which the latter and principal part of this project failed, has already been related among the tran&s;actions of that year. It remains now to give &s;ome account of the part in which Thurot was concerned.</P>
<P>His &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five frigates, on board of which were 1270 land &s;oldiers, &s;ailed from the port of Dunkirk on the 5th of October 1759. They had been blocked up until that time by an Engli&s;h fleet; but under favour of an hazy night, they put out to &s;ea, and arrived at Gottenburg in Sweden ten days after. From thence they made to Bergen in Norway. In the&s;e voyages, the men were reduced by &s;ickne&s;s, and the ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves had &s;o &s;uffered by &s;torms, that they were obliged to &s;end one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them back to France. It was not until the 5th of December, that they were able to &s;ail directly for their place of de&s;tination. But their old ill for|tune pur&s;ued them with fre&s;h di&s;appointments. For near three months they beat backward and forward among&s;t the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland, having in vain attempted a conve|nient landing near Derry. In this tedious interval they &s;uf|fered every po&s;&s;ible hard&s;hip. Their men were thinned and di&s;heartened. Another of their &s;hips was &s;eparated from them, of which they never heard more. The now remain|ing three were extremely &s;hattered, and their crews &s;uffer|ed extremely by famine. This obliged them to put into the i&s;le of Ilay;

<P>Such was their diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, that they overtook Thurot's &s;quadron before they could get out of the Iri&s;h &s;ea. They were exactly three frigates to three. The French &s;hips were much the larger, and their men much more nu|merous; but both &s;hips and men were in a bad condition. A &s;harp and clo&s;e engagement began. None of the French could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape, and they mu&s;t take or be taken. Thurot did all that could be expected from the intrepidity of his character; he fought his &s;hip until &s;he had her hold almo&s;t filled with water, and her decks covered with dead bodies. At length he was killed. The crew of his &s;hip, and by her example tho&s;e of the other two, di&s;pirited by this blow, and pre&s;&s;ed with uncommon alacrity by the &s;ig|nal bravery of Capt. Elliott, and tho&s;e who commanded un|der him, &s;truck, and were carried into Ram&s;ay Bay in the I&s;le of Man. Even this incon&s;iderable action added to the glory of the Engli&s;h arms.

The public indeed lamented the death of the brave Thurot, who even whil&s;t he commanded a priva|teer, fought le&s;s for plunder than honour; who&s;e behaviour was on all occa&s;ions full of humanity and genero&s;ity; and who&s;e undaunted courage rai&s;ed him to rank, and me|rited di&s;tinction. His death &s;ecured the glory he always &s;ought: he did not live to be brought a pri&s;oner into En|gland; or to hear in France tho&s;e malignant critici&s;ms, which &s;o often attend unfortunate bravery.

He marched into the enemies country. He made war upon the Indians after their own manner. No other would have been effectual. He burned E&s;tatoe the capital of the Lower Cherokees, con&s;i&s;ting of 200 hou&s;es, an Indian town of the very fir&s;t magnitude; and then proceeded to the &s;ame execution on all the towns and villages of that di|&s;trict of the Cherokees, which were numerous, populous, and wealthy.

But the Colonel marched with equal diligence and arrived about the time when the French had made a practicable breach.

 His army con&s;i&s;ted of 1700 Europeans, and about 3000 black troops. Lally's amounted to 2200 Europeans, and between 9 and 10,000 blacks.

Three thou&s;and <HI>Moratta</HI> hor&s;e about this time joined the enemy, which put me to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for want of provi&s;ions, as they plundered all the country.

On the 10th, Gen. <HI>Lally</HI> marched with all his army towards <HI>Wondiwa&s;h,</HI> and I moved with our army along the bank of the river, in order to ob&s;erve their motions, and cover our own country. On the 12th, I received a letter from the commanding officer at <HI>Conjeveram,</HI> that 500 of the enemy's <HI>Europeans,</HI> and a large body of hor&s;e, had entered the town; and that the re&s;t of their army lay at <HI>Jango|lam,</HI> three miles di&s;tance from it: I therefore put the army in motion, and endeavoured, by a forced march, to &s;ave that place, which was very weak (but of con&s;equence to us) and happily ar|rived there the 13th before day-light. The enemy quitted the place, their army moved towards <HI>Wondiwa&s;h.</HI> The 15th I cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Palla</HI> with all the army, and on the 17th arrived at <HI>Outrema|lour,</HI> about fourteen miles from <HI>Wondiwa&s;h,</HI> which place I found M. <HI>Lally</HI> had inve&s;ted, and began to rai&s;e batteries.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER a general war of five years, carried on with the greate&s;t effu&s;ion of blood, and the mo&s;t ex|traordinary expence ever known to attend a war of that continuance, it was hoped that, if the animo&s;ity of the belligerent powers was not abated, at lea&s;t a great part of the fuel of di&s;cord had been con&s;umed; and that the time was arrived for giving peace to Europe. Some propo&s;itions for that purpo&s;e had been made in the clo&s;e of the year 1759. Tho&s;e who rather wi&s;hed for peace, than very

attentively con&s;idered the probability of effecting it, &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ed to think it might then have been expected.

is concluded on other terms, as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has found by &s;evere experience, and as we ob&s;erved on a form|er occa&s;ion, is only a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation, and not a perfect peace. But it mu&s;t be acknowledged that this &s;ituation, the mo&s;t coincident with their true intere&s;t, is at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t contradictory to the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of nations. It appears hard to loo&s;e upon every &s;ide every object of the war. A peace on this foundation will be cen|&s;ured, but it is the be&s;t, on the &s;ame principle that the &s;horte&s;t follies are the be&s;t; and that no injured pride is left to brood over a future war. Contrary to the opinion of the warm patriots on all &s;ides, we therefore imagined that the year &s;eventeen hundred and fifty-eight, in the clo&s;e of the third campaign, was the happy moment for negocia|tion. At this time, however, no propo&s;itions had been made. The propo&s;itions of &s;eventeen hundred and fifty-nine were but &s;lightly regarded, and obviou&s;ly could end in nothing. But in the beginning of the year, of which we are now going to treat, the &s;cene of negociation was opened with far greater &s;olemnity and parade; and as it was car|ried on with great diligence, it nece&s;&s;arily makes a principal part of the hi&s;tory of this year. It is indeed &s;omewhat for|tunate both for the writers and the readers of the&s;e events that this treaty has intervened. The narative otherwi&s;e had proved extremely barren and unentertaining. For though the animo&s;ity of the belligerent powers was not, as we ob&s;erved, abated, their efforts, however, had con&s;ide|rably &s;lackened, and their operations began gradually to de|generate into the Petiteguerre. Tho&s;e va&s;t events that a&s;toni&s;h the mind, or hold it in a plea&s;ing &s;u&s;pence; tho&s;e important battles and &s;ieges; tho&s;e rapid and well conduct|ed marches, and tho&s;e lively enterprizes which di&s;tingui&s;h the former years, except in a very few in&s;tances, &s;carce make any part of the hi&s;tory before us. But though the operations of the field had fallen into a &s;tate of langour, the cabinet became full of bu&s;ine&s;s, and negociation flou|ri&s;hed. In this &s;ituation candour obliges us to acquaint our readers that we are &s;till more liable to mi&s;takes, than when we attempt to de&s;cribe the tran&s;actions of the campaign. It very frequently happens, that the accounts of the military operations come authenticated from the hands of tho&s;e great generals who have conducted them, and when we have al|lowed for the partiality of the account, there is nothing to
<PB N="356" REF="405">
be detracted from them for want of &s;ufficient information. Even in the ca&s;e of partiality, we are often able to correc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mi&s;repre&s;entation or over-charge of one of the parties by that of the other. The&s;e things are done in the eye of the world. But the motives either to peace or war, and the &s;teps taken in a negociation, are all behind the curtain. They do not appear for a long time, and, &s;ometimes they never appear completely. There is however, an advantage in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. For one of the powers at war, in order to ju&s;tify to its &s;ubjects and to the world, its part in the continuance of a war &s;o fatal to both, has publi&s;hed an account of the late negociation; artful indeed, and pro|bably in &s;ome re&s;pects unfair; but containing at the &s;ame time many valuable and illu&s;trating pieces, the authenticity of which is not di&s;puted. The point in &s;uch ca&s;es to be dreaded is not the publication of fal&s;e pieces but the con|cealment of &s;everal that are real and important. The public information is probably rather incompleat, than un|true. We wait with impatience for that full and authen|tic narrative of &s;o important a negociation, which undoubt|edly our court propo&s;es to publi&s;h. We have delayed the &s;etting out our work the longer, in hopes of its appearance, by which we might have been able to perfect and correct our account of this tran&s;action. The account of the Spa|ni&s;h negotiation has appeared late, but we have not failed to make u&s;e of it. At pre&s;ent we engage in our work, un|der tho&s;e difficulties, which it is ju&s;t the reader &s;hould know and allow for. In the &s;ucceeding year we &s;hall take care to profit of whatever further lights may be im|parted.</P>
<P>Very early in this year 1761, the courts of Peter&s;burgh, Vienna, France, Sweden and Poland, agreed &s;everally and jointly to offer propo&s;als towards renewing that negotiation for peace, which had abruptly been broken off in the clo&s;e of the year 1759. France was the principal and fir&s;t mo|ver; for as it was her ambition which had made the war &s;o general, and her revenue which in a great mea&s;ure &s;up|ported it; the former being now humbled by a &s;eries of unfortunate events, and the latter reduced by mo&s;t enor|mous expences, &s;he began at length to relent, and appa|rently to de&s;ire peace in earne&s;t. The other members of the grand alliance could not decently, nor &s;afely oppo&s;e the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of France. The court of Sweden in par|ticular
<PB N="357" REF="406">
was given to under&s;tand, that the exhau&s;ted condi|tion of France was the true motive of her moderation; that in fact, &s;he was not able any longer to furni&s;h the &s;tipulated &s;ub&s;idies, nor to adhere to the letter of her en|gagements with her allies. The&s;e circum&s;tances, which &s;he was neither able, nor &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to conceal, formed the &s;ure&s;t guaranty of her &s;incerity.</P>
<P>The five parties to the war on that &s;ide, made as many declarations, which were &s;igned at Paris on the 25th of March, and delivered at London on the 31&s;t of the &s;ame month. The counter declaration of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia appeared on the 3d of April. Aug&s;burg, as the &s;itu|ation mo&s;t commodious for the powers at war, was appoint|ed for the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Egremont, Lord Stormont amba&s;&s;ador in Poland, and general Yorke our amba&s;&s;ador in Holland, were nomi|nated as the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries. On the part of France, the count de Choi&s;el was appointed. Aug&s;burg now became the centre of attention to all Europe, and each court prepared every thing towards this important meeting which it could furni&s;h of &s;plendor for the di&s;play of its dig|nity, and of ability for the &s;upport of its intere&s;t. The public conver&s;ation was for a while diverted from &s;cenes of horror, blood&s;hed, and pillage; and every mind was em|ployed more agreeably on the public &s;cene of magnificence, and the private game of policy, which was to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, in order that a negotiation, in it&s;elf &s;ufficiently intricate, &s;hould be the le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed, to admit to the treaty none but the parties principally concerned, together with their allies.</P>
<P>Although this exclu&s;ion of the neutral intere&s;ts tended greatly to di&s;embarre&s;s and &s;implify the negotiation, yet &s;uch was the variety of &s;eparate and independent matters, which &s;till remained to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, that it became advi&s;e|able to make a further &s;eparation, if they hoped to treat upon them with any tolerable ea&s;e, or with any pro&s;pect of coming to a &s;peedy deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring back the mo|tives to the war to their fir&s;t principles; and to di&s;engage tho&s;e &s;everal intere&s;ts which originally, and in their own nature had no connection, from that ma&s;s, in which mutual injuries and a common animo&s;ity had blended and con|founded them. This propo&s;ition came fir&s;t from France,

<PB N="358" REF="409">
and it was an early and happy omen of her inclination t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> peace.</P>
<P>The war, which was truly and originally German, evi|dently had but a &s;ingle, though this a very difficult object to determine the fate of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. So many powers were concerned in this determination, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> views of aggrandi&s;ement, indemnification, and revenge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> various and difficult to be reconciled, that this alone &s;eemed matter enough for a &s;eparate and very arduous negotiation. In effect all the powers of the north were concerned in it. For this rea&s;on, the other great object of the general war, the limits of America, which by that &s;trange chain of ho&s;tile connections, which even unites the various inde|pendent quarrels and enmities of Europe, had been mixed with the German di&s;putes, was again &s;et upon its proper and peculiar ba&s;is; and whil&s;t the truly German intere&s;ts were handled at Aug&s;burg, it was propo&s;ed to treat on this head &s;eparately in London and in Paris. For this purpo&s;e, mini&s;ters were mutually &s;ent from tho&s;e courts; Mr. Stan|ley on the part of England; and Mr. Bu&s;&s;y on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> France.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition was al&s;o exceedingly prudent; for there is no doubt that if the&s;e potentates could &s;ettle their claims to their mutual &s;atisfaction, and &s;hould carry to Aug&s;burg the &s;ame candour and good faith, and the &s;ame &s;incere de|&s;ire of peace, their influence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily tend to in&s;pire principles of moderation into the re&s;t, and mu&s;t contribute largely to accelerate the great work of pacification.</P>
<P>Things were thus &s;et upon the be&s;t footing po&s;&s;ible, and the negotiation &s;eemed to be in the happie&s;t train that could be wi&s;hed. But unfortunately the plan and di&s;po&s;ition of the treaty were much more ea&s;ily adju&s;ted, than the matter and the &s;ub&s;tance. It was very obvious, that France if &s;he was willing even to pretend to a de&s;ire of peace, could &s;carce avoid making conce&s;&s;ions, which to her were &s;ufficiently mortifying. The moment her proper quarrel came to be &s;eparated from the general cau&s;e, &s;he had every di&s;advan|tage in the negociation, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;uffered every di&s;|a&s;ter in the war. On the &s;ide of Germany indeed &s;he had acted with &s;ucce&s;s; but even there the advantages &s;he had acquired were &s;till precarious, as the chance of war was &s;till open: no propo&s;ition for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms having been admitted. As &s;he knew therefore, that great &s;acrifices
<PB N="359" REF="410">
might be expected from her, &s;he did not &s;o finally re&s;t her hopes upon the negotiation, as not to look out for another re&s;ource; and this rendered on her part the whole proceed|ing le&s;s effective and le&s;s &s;incere.</P>
<P>The re&s;ource &s;he &s;ought was in Spain, who &s;he hoped could not look with indifference on the humiliation of the principal branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Hitherto in|deed the king of Spain had ob&s;erved a tolerable exact neu|trality in his conduct, and in his declarations had &s;pared no expre&s;&s;ions of good will and friend&s;hip to our court. He &s;eemed to be wholly intent on the internal oeconomy of his dominions, on the improvement of their long neglected police, on the advancement of their commerce, and the re|gulation of the finances. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e do|me&s;tic attentions, the French mini&s;try did not de&s;pair of drawing his regards abroad. They thought that the offers which France in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would find her|&s;elf obliged to make, mu&s;t extremely alarm all good Spani|ards, who could not &s;ee without the mo&s;t &s;erious apprehen|&s;ions, the French power wholly annihilated in America. By this event, their colonies, though &s;o much &s;uperior to all others in opulence and extent, mu&s;t in a manner be at the mercy of England: no power being in any &s;ort able to afford them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to hold the ballance between them and the power of England. At this time indeed, the French court had not ab&s;olutely &s;ucceeded in her de&s;igns at Madrid: but &s;he was in hopes, that every &s;tep &s;he took in the treaty and every conce&s;&s;ion &s;he &s;hould make, would prove a fre&s;h incentive to the jealou&s;ies and apprehen&s;ions of Spain. Thus in effect all the motions which France &s;eemingly made towards peace were in reality &s;o many &s;teps towards a new war; and whil&s;t at London &s;he breathed nothing but moderation, and the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire of putting a period to the calamities of Europe, at Madrid &s;he was taking the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for &s;preading them further, and continu|ing them longer.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of England, though there was far more good faith in the public procedure, there were al&s;o, it mu&s;t be admitted, many circum&s;tances which co-operated to re|tard the peace. The great and almo&s;t unparallelled &s;ucce&s;s which attended our arms in this war, had rai&s;ed a proporti|onable expectation, and in&s;pired very high thoughts into the minds of the people. They thought it unrea&s;onable to
<PB N="360" REF="411">
make almo&s;t any conce&s;&s;ions to a nation who&s;e ambition and violence they had always found to corre&s;pond with its power, and whom they now con&s;idered as lying at their mercy. That this was the time for reducing France, which if we let pa&s;s, we could never hope again to recover. In the&s;e &s;entiments it mu&s;t have fared ill with that admini&s;tration, who &s;hould make a &s;acrifice of any of tho&s;e objects on which the people had &s;et their hearts.</P>
<P>On the other hand it could not have e&s;caped them, that the &s;ituation of affairs in Germany, however they might be artificially &s;eparated in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have an influence on the final determination of the treaty. They &s;aw, that after a &s;evere &s;truggle of five years, the affairs of our neare&s;t allies were only not ruined. To &s;ay nothing of the condition of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the whole country of He&s;&s;e was in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of France; they likewi&s;e held the county of Hanau; and by their occupation of Got|tingen, the Hanoverian territory lay open to their arms. If this quarrel &s;hould be con&s;idered as a cau&s;e not &s;trictly En|gli&s;h, (though the French in their memorials contended it was), yet certainly the He&s;&s;ians, and principally the Hano|verians, were allies of &s;o near a connection, and had done and &s;uffered &s;o much in the common cau&s;e, that it mu&s;t have appeared &s;hocking to all Europe, if &s;olely attentive to our own peculiar advantages, we &s;hould patch up a peace without any provi&s;ion in their favour: and it was very evi|dent, that this provi&s;ion could not be made in the &s;ituation in which the la&s;t campaign had left them, unle&s;s our govern|ment purcha&s;ed it at a price that would be very grudgingly paid by the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, perplexed between the natural expectati|ons of their country, and the rea&s;onable expectations of their allies, mu&s;t have found it not a little difficult to know what party they ought to take. In order to reconcile, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e contradictory de&s;ires, the only &s;olution which could be found was to pu&s;h the war with the utmo&s;t vigour; and in the mean time not to hurry the negotiation: in hopes that during its progre&s;s things might take &s;uch a turn, as to enable them to purcha&s;e peace for their allies out of the acqui&s;itions they &s;hould have made after the com|mencement of the treaty, and without being obliged to have recour&s;e to their conque&s;ts, previous to that aera. On this footing they propo&s;ed to &s;atisfy the demands of the public
<PB N="361" REF="412">
faith, and at the &s;ame time to pre&s;erve the reputation which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their affairs at home. Accordingly the duke of Brun&s;wick was to pro&s;ecute with the utmo&s;t vigour, the operations which he had begun in the depth of winter; and an expedition, the object of which was then &s;ecret, was prepared with equal diligence in England.</P>
<P>In the&s;e equivocal di&s;po&s;itions, and in this odd mixture of ho&s;tile and pacific mea&s;ures, began the year 1761, a year more remarkable, perhaps, than any of tho&s;e we have hi|therto de&s;cribed, for events which will be radically deci&s;ive of the future pro&s;perity or mi&s;ery of Europe, but le&s;s, for tho&s;e matters by which the imagination of the reader is commonly affected. Having in this chapter laid down, as far as we can conjecture, the political motives for the un|common effort which was made in Germany, in our next chapter we &s;hall give an account of the military plan of this effort, the execution and the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign, the French had the entire and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole territory of He&s;&s;e: a country tolerably provided, and which contains many tenable places. Some of the&s;e, they had &s;trengthened with additional works; and they had ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e ma|gazines in the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituations. This was their condition in the front of their winter cantonments. On their left they had driven the allies from the Lower Rhine, where they kept a con&s;iderable body of troops, which &s;treightened our quarters, and checked our efforts on that &s;ide. On their right they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the town of Gottingen, in which they had placed a very &s;trong garri&s;on; and thus they &s;hut us up on this quarter al&s;o, whil&s;t the king's German dominions lay entirely open to their enterprizes.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="413">If we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the French armies, they will pre&s;ent us with the idea of an immen&s;e cre&s;cent, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two advanced points of which were at Gottingen and We&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the body extended in He&s;&s;e: &s;o that being perfectly well provided with magazines, and ma&s;ter of all the prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> communications, nece&s;&s;ary for their current &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, with &s;trong places in their rear, and in both their flanks&punc; in the next campaign they had only to advance their &s;evera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;ts in a manner to enclo&s;e the allied army, which, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s (from their numbers and &s;ituation, hard+ly to be expected) would find it&s;elf entirely incapable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> making any &s;tand again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand was very &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e inconvenien|cies of his &s;ituation, and of the advantages the enemy ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> over him. It was extremely difficult to &s;ettle a plan for ac|tion; but no action could be attended with much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> con&s;equences, than inactivity in a bad condition. He knew from experience, that the French were ill qualified for win+ter operations in Germany, and that his own &s;oldiers, be&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their &s;uperior hardine&s;s, and their being inured to the ri+gour of the climate, could &s;uffer but little more from field &s;ervice, e&s;pecially if attended with &s;ucce&s;s, than they mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> endure from the badne&s;s of their winter quarters. It is tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that there was &s;omething di&s;couraging in the attack of a very &s;uperior body of the enemy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every advantage again&s;t him: but it was clear, that this &s;uperiority, and the&s;e advantages would not le&s;&s;en as the &s;ummer approach|ed. It was clear, that every &s;tep the enemy gained on him would render his defence weaker and his re&s;ources mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;canty; and that if the enemy found them&s;elves in a conditi+on to commence this campaign where they had conclude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the la&s;t, and that nothing &s;hould hinder their proceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the earlie&s;t &s;ea&s;on, he could never rea&s;onably hope to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tract the war to another year.

<P>Having therefore re&s;olved to act, he lo&s;t no time to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with vigour. He appointed three places of rendezvous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Dymel, the Rhine, and in Saverland. His army a&s;&s;em|bled on the 9th of February, without &s;uffering the enemy to have any previous notice of their intentions. The next day the troops halted, and the duke communicated to his
<PB N="363" REF="414">
generals the di&s;po&s;ition he had made for the motions of the whole.</P>
<P>The centre was led by his &s;erene highne&s;s in per&s;on; it penetrated directly into He&s;&s;e, and marching by Zierenberg and Durenberg, made its way towards Ca&s;&s;el. The right and left of the army were each at a very con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from this body; but they were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as fully to co-operate in the general plan of operation, which was very exten&s;ive. The hereditary prince commanded on the right: he marched by Stadbergen for Mengeringhau&s;en; and leaving the country of He&s;&s;e to the Ea&s;tward, as the alarm was to be as &s;udden, and as widely diffu&s;ed as po&s;&s;i|ble, he pu&s;hed forward with the utmo&s;t expedition into the heart of the French quarters. General Sporcken com|manded a corps at a greater di&s;tance to the left, and pene|trated into Thuringia, by Duder&s;tadt and Heiligen&s;tadt. The de&s;ign of this movement was to break the communi|cation of the French with the army of the Empire, to open one for our&s;elves with the Pru&s;&s;ians, and to cut off all inter|cour&s;e between the grand army of the enemy, and their garri&s;on at Gottingen.</P>
<P>By this &s;udden, exten&s;ive, and vigorous attack, the French were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation: they retreated, or rather fled upon every &s;ide. It could &s;carcely have been imagined, that this was the &s;ame army which had but ju&s;t clo&s;ed the campaign with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. Such has been the &s;port of fortune in this war, even beyond all former examples of her caprice, that the in&s;tances are numerous of inferior and beaten armies, without any appa|rent change in their circum&s;tances, driving the conquerors before them. So remarkable was the revolution of fortune at this time, that it is highly credible if the French had had their quarters in an open country, their army had been to|tally de&s;troyed: but happily for them, they had very &s;uffi|cient means of &s;ecuring their retreat. For as the allies ad|vanced, they were obliged to leave Ca&s;&s;el and Gottingen at their backs; into the former of which the enemy had thrown a garri&s;on equal to a moderate army; and in the latter they had 7 or 8000 men. Beyond the&s;e again were Fritzlar, Ziegenhayn, and Marpurg, places of a tolerable degree of &s;trength and well garri&s;oned, be&s;ides &s;ome other inferior po&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="415">The hereditary prince, who&s;e party was the mo&s;t advanc|ed, &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, by an attempt to &s;urprize Fritz|lar. He had received advice that it was not prepared to re|ceive him. He accordingly took only a few battalions and no cannon, in hopes of being able to carry that place at once. But unfortunately he was deceived in his intelligence. The garri&s;on was prepared and re&s;olute, and though the hereditary prince attacked it with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, he was obliged for that time to de&s;i&s;t, and to draw off with no in|con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time, Marpurg was attempted in the &s;ame manner, and with no better &s;ucce&s;s. Gen. Breidenback, an Hanoverian officer, of great bravery, experience and repu|tation, who commanded there, lo&s;t his life in the attack. The&s;e two &s;evere checks at the entrance into action, did not however di&s;courage either the parties that &s;uffered them, or the re&s;t of the army. They advanced as expeditiou&s;ly, and with more caution. Cannon and mortars were brought be|fore Fritzlar, which, after a defence that was rather made for the credit of the commander, than from any hope of &s;aving the place,

 <MILESTONE N="Feb. 15."> 

 &s;urrendered on honour|able terms. A large magazine was found here. The marquis of Granby was employed, with &s;ucce&s;s, in reducing the forts and ca&s;tles in this neighbourhood. The allied army re&s;olutely advanced, and as they advanced, the French continually retired, abandoning po&s;t after po&s;t, and fell back almo&s;t to the Maine. They fired their magazines as they retreated; but the allies pur&s;ued with &s;o much ra|pidity, that they &s;aved five capital &s;tores; one of which con|tained no le&s;s than 80,000 &s;acks of meal, 50,000 &s;acks of oats, and a million of rations of hay, a very &s;mall part of which had been de&s;troyed. The&s;e were acqui&s;itions of the utmo&s;t advantage, as they wonderfully facilitated the pro|gre&s;s of the army; which, as it advanced, &s;till found its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; provi&s;ion was al&s;o thereby made for the caval|ry, which otherwi&s;e, it could never have been &s;upplied with in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, and at &s;uch a va&s;t di&s;tance from our origi|nal quarters.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;ucce&s;s in front, it was not here the grand object of our operations lay. Ca&s;&s;el was to be redu|ced. The French had in that town a garri&s;on of 17 batta|lions, be&s;ides &s;ome other corps, under the command of the count de Broglio; and there was no doubt, that he would
<PB N="365" REF="416">
defend the place to the utmo&s;t. The fortifications of Ca&s;&s;el are mo&s;tly in the old manner; they con&s;i&s;t of very high, but &s;trong walls. Some works indeed had been newly ad|ded; but the great hope of the enemy was in the &s;trength of the garri&s;on and the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on. The &s;iege of this place was not to be delayed; however it was nece&s;&s;ary previou&s;ly to clear all the adjacent country of the enemy, and to cut off the communication of the garri&s;on with their grand army.</P>
<P>Therefore when mar&s;hal Broglio had been driven quite out off He&s;&s;e, and had retreated towards Frankfort, prince Ferdinand cea&s;ed to advance; and having ordered two bo|dies to the blockade of Marpurg and Ziegenhayn, which &s;till ob&s;tinately held out, he formed that part of the army which was with him into a chain of cantonments, making a front towards the enemy which extended from the river Lahn to the river Ohm, and from the Ohm to the Fulda; thus he propo&s;ed to watch the motions of mar&s;hal Broglio's army, to cover the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, and the blockades of the two fortre&s;&s;es ju&s;t mentioned. The &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was carried on by the count of Lippe Schaumburg a &s;overeign prince of the empire, reputed one of the able&s;t engineers in Europe. His management of the artillery at Thornhau&s;en was a principal cau&s;e in the acqui&s;ition of that great victory; and it was not doubted that his abilities would be exerted as effectively at Ca&s;&s;el. Trenches were opened on the fir&s;t of March. All eyes were now directed to this point; for on the &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;troke depended the whole fortune of the campaign. It was very apparent that if Ca&s;&s;el and its garri&s;on &s;hould fall into the hands of the allies, Gottingen and the inferior places mu&s;t inevitably fall along with it; and this misfortune would be more than equivalent to the lo&s;s of a great battle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the war was thus carried on in He&s;&s;e, M. Sporck|en who commanded the detachment to the left, on the &s;ide of Saxony, advanced with an intrepidity equal to the re&s;t; he was &s;oon joined by a corps of Pru&s;&s;ians, and the united army lo&s;t no time to clear the Werra and the Un&s;trut of the bodies of French and Saxons which occupied the mo&s;t im|portant po&s;t upon the&s;e rivers. As the&s;e bodies were ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted and could be &s;upported on one &s;ide by the garri&s;on of Gottingen, and on the other, as they pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves, by the army of the empire, they main|tained
<PB N="366" REF="417">
their ground; and this &s;oon brought on a &s;harp action.

 <MILESTONE N="Feb. 14."> 

 The allies attacked a large body advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted at Langen&s;altz upon the Un&s;trut; the event was entirely favourable. Three whole battalions of Saxons were made pri&s;oners by the Pru&s;&s;ians; M. de Sporcken took two battalions. The enemy's lo&s;s was computed at five thou&s;and men; &s;everal pieces of cannon were al&s;o taken, and a large magazine was aban|doned. This blow was well followed; one body of the combined army pu&s;hed to Ei&s;enach and Gotha, whil&s;t another by forced marches got forward to Fulda; the French gave way on their right; and the army of the empire on the left; the latter fell back to Bamberg, to|tally abandoning a very large tract of country.</P>
<P>Hitherto the affairs of the allies proceeded almo&s;t in an uninterrupted cour&s;e of pro&s;perity. It was indeed a degree of pro&s;perity altogether a&s;toni&s;hing, and which as at fir&s;t it could &s;carcely have been expected, &s;o there was no rea&s;on to imagine it would have any long continuance. For the allies on the &s;ide of Saxony, where M. Sporcken acted, in pro|portion as their activity and &s;ucce&s;s carried them forward, left the countries on their rear more and more uncovered, and expo&s;ed, without any or with a very in&s;ufficient defence, to the attempts of the powerful garri&s;on of Gottingen. The count de Vaux, who commanded that garri&s;on, is a very able and enterprizing officer. And he no &s;ooner perceived, that the allies were wholly intent upon driving their enemies from the Werra and Un&s;trut, and on pu&s;hing the advantages they had acquired to the utmo&s;t, then he marched out of Gottingen with a &s;trong detachment, attacked and routed as Hanoverian convoy, fell upon the town of Duder&s;tadt with the utmo&s;t violence; and though he failed in his fir&s;t at|tempt, he repeated it with &s;o much &s;pirit, that at length he carried that town, and afterwards &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable places near it. By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es he prevented M. de Sporcken's corps from returning by the way they had ad|vanced, and indeed ab&s;olutely di&s;qualified them from acting &s;eperately from their main army; to which &s;oon after the&s;e events, they were obliged to join them&s;elves. This junc|tion now became nece&s;&s;ary on another account,</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Broglio towards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign had been obliged, by the enterprizes of the hereditary Prince, to detach from his army in He&s;&s;e a large body to
<PB N="367" REF="418">
the lower Rhine. He now found it equally proper to re|call this body together with further reinforcements, in order to maintain his ground in the country northward of the Maine, where he was clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the allies, and which he mu&s;t be compelled &s;hamefully to relinqui&s;h, if Ca&s;&s;el was not relieved in time. Sen&s;ible of this, with whatever difficulty, he called in his mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;ts, em|bodied his army, in&s;pired them with new &s;pirits, and made them capable, by a more exact order in their di&s;cipline and a great &s;uperiority in their numbers, of attempting &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the hopes of the allies, depended on the effect of their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; they were obliged to attempt too many objects at the &s;ame time, and the&s;e too arduous for the number of which their army con&s;i&s;ted. For it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould keep one army, and that no &s;mall one, employed on the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el; another was occupied in the blockade of Ziegenhayn; a third was employed to the ea&s;tward of the Fulda; and &s;till a fourth was nece&s;&s;ary to cover and &s;u&s;tain all the&s;e various opera|tions, and to oppo&s;e it&s;elf to the attempts of Mar&s;hal Brog|lio. It was but too plain, that when the whole of the French force was collected in one point, it could never be re&s;i&s;ted by a part only of the allied army; if they &s;hould attempt to draw away any of the &s;eperate corps from the critical &s;ervice upon which it was employed, the entire pur|po&s;e of their labours was given up. In a word, Prince Ferdinand had three &s;trong po&s;ts of the enemy on his rear, and their grand army now perfectly united on his front, and his &s;ituation, which was far from advantageous, obliged him to call in M. Sporcken's body which had effected its pur|po&s;e and could be&s;t be &s;pared. However the prince kept his po&s;ition as long as po&s;&s;ible; and the &s;iege was carried on with as much vigour as a winter operation, and the &s;pi|rited defence of a great garri&s;on ably commanded, would admit.</P>
<P>But Mar&s;hal Broglio, as &s;oon as he had collected his army, advanced without delay. He cau&s;ed the troops under the hereditary prince to be attacked near the village of Stange|rode, in the neighbourhood of Grunberg, where he was ad|vanced in front of the before-mentioned line of the allied army. The attack was made by the enemies dragoons, the very fir&s;t &s;hock of which broke the whole foot, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="368" REF="419">
nine regiments, Hanoverians, He&s;&s;ians, and Brun&s;wickers. The French on this occa&s;ion made two thou&s;and pri&s;oners, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;everal trophies of victory; few were killed or wounded on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>After this blow the allied army could no longer think of making head again&s;t the French, or of maintaining their ground in He&s;&s;e. They broke up the blockade of Ziegen|hayn; and &s;oon after rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, after twenty-&s;even days open trenches. They evacuated the whole coun|try of He&s;&s;e, retired behind the Dymel, and falling back nearly to the quarters they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before this undertaking.</P>
<P>Thus ended an expedition which was carried on again&s;t many difficulties, with much &s;pirit, and which at fir&s;t excit|ed great hopes. It failed indeed in &s;ome of its objects; but it produced its effect in the total of the operations of the year. The French, by the de&s;truction or &s;eizure of &s;o many of their principal magazines, were for a long time di&s;abled from taking any advantage of their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the preced|ing campaign, or from their late victory. It was hot until the &s;ea&s;on was a good deal advanced that they were in a condition to act. This ce&s;&s;ation was not dearly bought even by the lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained at Stangerode, and the ex|treme hard&s;hips the troops had endured during the whole &s;ervice; for circum&s;tanced as both armies were at their quitting the field, without this &s;ea&s;onable check it is proba|ble we &s;hould have at this day no footing in Germany. Both armies as it where by con&s;ent lay quiet in their winter quar|ters. During their inaction, the negotiation at London and Paris, who&s;e commencement we have related in the fir&s;t chapter, was pur&s;ued without interruption.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that after the judicious &s;eperations which had been made of the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal pow|ers at war, there &s;till remained a &s;ufficient fund of intricacy and altercations in each particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In order there|fore
<PB N="369" REF="420">
to make the way to peace as &s;mooth as po&s;&s;ible, it was re&s;olved previou&s;ly to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome certain and &s;imple points that might &s;erve to direct and keep &s;teady the whole nego|tiation. The&s;e points were but two; indeed they were &s;o in&s;eperably connected with each other, that they &s;eemed rather members of the &s;ame propo&s;ition than &s;eparate arti|cles. The fir&s;t was, <HI>that the two crowns &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they have conquered one from the other.</HI> The &s;econd imported that, <HI>the &s;ituation in which they &s;hall &s;tand at certain periods, &s;hall be the po&s;ition to &s;erve as a ba&s;is for the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</HI></P>
<P>As France was known to have had the wor&s;t in the war, a propo&s;ition of <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> coming from her, mu&s;t have ap|peared an in&s;tance of moderation, altogether &s;urprizing to our mini&s;ters. It is certain, that had peace been concluded at that in&s;tant, and upon the &s;ole foundation of this article, England would then have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conque&s;ts &s;he had made, every one of which was in a very high degree advan|tageous to her commerce and her power, and none of which could be con&s;idered as a &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, France continuing in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the places &s;he had conquered, would have acquired no advantage that could at all countervail the expence of keeping them; at the &s;ame time that &s;he would be expo&s;ed to endle&s;s alter|cations, and would afford matter of the highe&s;t jealou&s;y, in|dignation, and di&s;content, even to her neare&s;t allies. This ba&s;is being therefore &s;ettled, although it was evident, that the treaty could not re&s;t upon this ba&s;is &s;olely. England had certainly a great &s;uperiority in the negotiation, and might rationally expect (when they &s;hould come to talk of re&s;titutions) to purcha&s;e the evacuation of the French con|que&s;ts in Germany, at a much &s;maller price than their ap|parent magnitude might &s;eem to demand. However the&s;e were &s;till a matter of &s;o much anxiety, and the nature of the preci&s;e &s;tipulations were &s;till &s;o uncertain, that the ne|gotiation, though it proceeded with &s;trong appearance of a de&s;ire for peace, met with very frequent checks and delays. Both parties were indeed unanimous in the article of <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis;</HI> than which, it mu&s;t be admitted, there could not be a better ground to treat upon. But as the war &s;till conti|nued, and whil&s;t it continued might make a daily alteration in the fortune of the contracting powers, it was nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="370" REF="421">
to fix upon &s;ome epochas to which this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory article &s;hould refer.</P>
<P>The French on this head propo&s;ed, <HI>that the &s;ituation in which they &s;hall &s;tand on the</HI> fir&s;t of September in the year 1761 <HI>in the Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> on the fir&s;t of July in the &s;ame year <HI>in the We&s;t-Indies and in Africa, and on</HI> the fir&s;t of May following <HI>in Europe, &s;hould be the po&s;ition, which &s;hould &s;erve as a ba&s;is to the treaty which may be negotiated be|tween the two powers.</HI> They added further, that as the&s;e epochas might &s;eem too near or too di&s;tant for the intere&s;t of Great Britain, they were extremely willing to enter into a negotiation upon that object.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try received this propo&s;ition with le&s;s &s;atisfaction than its apparent fairne&s;s de&s;erved. They en|tirely rejected the French epochas; and declared that they could not admit, without prejudice to them&s;elves, any other epochas than tho&s;e which <HI>have reference to the day of &s;ign|ing the treaty of peace.</HI> Had this re&s;olution been &s;trictly adhered to, it was evident that the negotiation was that moment at an end. For though what was a&s;&s;erted in the French memorial in reply to this declaration, <HI>(that the ba&s;is of the propo&s;ition of</HI> uti po&s;&s;idetis <HI>was nece&s;&s;arily connected with the particular epochas propo&s;ed)</HI> is by no means to be admitted; it is on the other hand not ea&s;y to deny the va|lidity of their &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;ertion, "that if not the&s;e, at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> certain periods during the war ought to be fixed; and that the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> could not rea&s;onably have reference only to the time of &s;igning the treaty of peace." For if the contrary principle was once admitted, it would become difficult to know, or even with probability to gue&s;s, at the nature or the value of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which by &s;uch an ar|ticle &s;hould be mutually given away. And if the&s;e difficul|ties occurred in the &s;implicity of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory article, they mu&s;t be increa&s;ed tenfold upon every other, and mu&s;t come to &s;uch an height as to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of negotiation on things of &s;o intricate a nature as exchanges and equiva|lents. The French in their memorial in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trongly on the propriety of e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e periods, that they threatened to recal the whole propo&s;ition if they were not agreed to.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t doubtle&s;s appear at fir&s;t view &s;urprizing to &s;ee France, who&s;e actual &s;ituation was very indifferent, con|tending for a near period, and England, who&s;e affairs were
<PB N="371" REF="422">
at that time apparently in a pro&s;perous &s;ituation, po&s;tponing the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> to one more remote. But the truth is, that in that particular neither party con&s;ulted their pre&s;ent con|dition. They acted wholly on fore&s;ight. For though the Engli&s;h, on the 25th of March, when this propo&s;ition was made, were carrying on the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, and the other &s;trong places in He&s;&s;e, and the enemy had no army in that country to oppo&s;e them, it was notwith&s;tanding evident that from the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e &s;ieges, and from the alacrity of mar&s;hal Broglio in collecting his troops, they mu&s;t be &s;hortly obliged to abandon the enterprize; it was evident that France mu&s;t be rein&s;tated in the ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her former conque&s;ts long before the epocha of the fir&s;t of May, the period which they fixed for Europe. Both courts were fully apprized of this. It was therefore the intere&s;t of France to offer and of England to reject this near period; e&s;pecially as the fate of the de&s;ign on the coa&s;t of France was then depending, and our admini&s;tration &s;eemed to have conceived no mean hopes of its &s;ucce&s;s, and no &s;mall opini|on of its importance in the negotiation.</P>
<P>The fleet employed in this expedition &s;ailed from Spit|head on the 29th of March, and it was &s;oon di&s;covered that Bellei&s;le was the object.</P>
<P>Bellei&s;le, the large&s;t of all the European i&s;lands belonging to the French King, is between 12 and 13 leagues in cir|cumference.</P>
<P>The i&s;land originally belonged to the earl of Cornouaille, but has been &s;ince yielded to the king: it contains only one little city, called Le Palais, three country towns, 103 vil|lages, and about 5000 inhabitants,</P>
<P>The town of Palais takes its name from a ca&s;tle, belong|ing to the duke de Bellei&s;le, in its neighbourhood, which is now converted into a citadel, which is a regular and &s;trong fortification, fronting the &s;ea, compo&s;ed principally of horn|work, and is provided with two dry ditches, the one next the counter&s;carp, and the other &s;o contrived as to &s;ecure the in|terior fortifications. This citadel is divided from the large&s;t part of the town by an inlet of the &s;ea, over which there is a bridge of communication; from the other part of the town; and which is mo&s;t inhabited, it is only divided by its own fortifications, and a glacis. There are three no|minal harbours in this i&s;land, Palais, Sauzon and Goulfard; every one of which labours under &s;ome capital defect, either
<PB N="372" REF="423">
in being expo&s;ed, &s;hallow, or dangerous at the entrance. The only branch of trade carried on here is the curing pilchards.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of the i&s;land, poor in it&s;elf, capable of little improvement, and &s;o ill circum&s;tanced in point of har|bours, a &s;ort of a di&s;like to the expedition began to ari&s;e. Several did not &s;ee of what con&s;iderable &s;ervice &s;uch a con|que&s;t could be of to England in time of peace, or of what prejudice to the enemy in time of war. They fore&s;aw that it could not be taken without con&s;iderable lo&s;s, or kept without con&s;iderable expence; and on the whole they ap|prehended that when exchanges came to be made, France would lay no great &s;tre&s;s upon it. On the other hand it was urged, that though the harbours were bad, yet &s;mall priva|teers might i&s;&s;ue from thence, greatly to the mole&s;tation of the French coa&s;ting trade; and that the fleet of England might ride between it and the continent in a well protected road. They imagined the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land, if not of great detriment to the intere&s;t of France, would be a grievous wound to her pride; and that tho&s;e circum&s;tances which had formerly induced her to expend money on the fortifications there, and on the apprehen&s;ion of an inva&s;ion to fill them with a powerful garri&s;on, would likewi&s;e per|&s;uade her to &s;et a value on the place when it came to be e&s;timated in the treaty.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they rea&s;oned in this manner in England, the fleet under the command of commodore Keppel, and the land forces under general Hodg&s;on, arrived before Bellei&s;le on the 7th of April, and on the 8th agreed to attempt a landing on the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the i&s;land in a &s;andy bay near Lochmaria point. Here the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little fort; they had moreover entrenched them&s;elves on an hill exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep, and the foot of which was &s;craped away. The attempt was made in three places with great re&s;olution: a few grenadiers got on &s;hore, and formed them|&s;elves; but as they were not &s;upported, they were for the greater part made pri&s;oners. The re&s;t of the army, after &s;everal very brave and repeated efforts, being wholly unable to force the enemies lines, or make good their landing, were obliged to retire with lo&s;s; what added to the di&s;a&s;ter was, that &s;everal of the flat bottomed ve&s;&s;els were de&s;troyed or damaged in an hard gale which followed on our retiring from the &s;hore. This made the pro&s;pect of any future at|tempt
<PB N="373" REF="424">
more unplea&s;ing even than the fir&s;t. In this attack we lo&s;t in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, near five hundred men.</P>
<P>Neither commanders nor &s;oldiers were however di&s;pirit|ed by this mortifying repul&s;e. They re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, not to return without effect, and then determined diligently to &s;earch the whole coa&s;t, in order to find a place more fa|vourable for another attack. The view indeed was not en|couraging. The i&s;land is naturally a fortification; and what nature had left undone to make it &s;uch, had been amply &s;upplied by art.</P>
<P>It was a long time after this fir&s;t failure before the wea|ther would give our commanders an opportunity of a &s;econd trial; however they per&s;i&s;ted with the utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s, and found at length a convenient &s;ituation. Not that it was a part of the coa&s;t le&s;s &s;trong than the re&s;t; on the contrary, they built their principal hopes on the exce&s;&s;ive &s;teepne&s;s and difficulty of the rocks, which had rendered the enemy rather le&s;s attentive on this quarter. This ar|duous attempt was made at a bold rocky &s;hore, near the above-mentioned point of Lockmaria. Be&s;ides the princi|ple attack, two feints were made at the &s;ame time to di&s;tract the enemy, whil&s;t the men of war directed their fire with great judgment and effect on the hills. The&s;e manoeuvres gave brigadier general Lambert with an handful of men, an opportunity of climbing up a very &s;teep rock, without mole&s;tation. This little body having thus pro&s;perou&s;ly gained the top of the hill, formed them&s;elves in good order, and without delay.

 <MILESTONE N="April 25."> 

 They were im|mediately attacked by three hundred of the French, but they maintained their advantage with re&s;o|lution until the whole corps of brigadier Lambert, which now had a&s;cended in the &s;ame manner, arrived to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and repul&s;ed the enemy

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the honour to acquaint you, that his Maje&s;ty's fleet under the command of Com. <HI>Keppel,</HI> and the tran&s;ports with his Mje&s;ty's forces on board, came to an anchor in this road on <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 7th in&s;t. about twelve o'clock. Soon after their ar|rival, I went with the Commodore to take a view of the coa&s;t; and we agreed at our return, that the port of St. <HI>Andro</HI> appeared to us to be the be&s;t place to make a de&s;cent; and it was &s;ettled, that Sir <HI>Thomas Stanhope,</HI> with &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips, and the tran&s;ports, with <HI>Stuart</HI>'s and <HI>Gray</HI>'s battalions and marines on board, &s;hould make a feint at <HI>Sauzon,</HI> at the &s;ame time that we made a real attack at St. <HI>Andro.</HI> Then it was too late in the day to do more than give the nece&s;&s;ary orders for the troops de&s;tined to land fir&s;t, to be ready to embark early in the morning in the flat bottomed boats, that I might attempt a landing as &s;oon as the &s;hips had &s;ilenced a four gun-battery, which commanded the en|trance of the bay. This was &s;oon done by the <HI>Achilles,</HI> after &s;he took her &s;tation. No time was then lo&s;t to go in with the boats, with the grenadiers, and the regiments ordered for this &s;ervice. But when we entered the bay, we found the enemy &s;o &s;trongly in|trenched on each &s;ide of the hill, which was exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep, and the foot of it &s;craped away, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get up to the brea&s;twork. After &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;ful efforts, &s;eeing it was impracticable to force the enemy from their lines, I thought it ad|vi&s;able to de&s;i&s;t. Maj. Gen. <HI>Crawford</HI> and Brig. <HI>Carleton</HI> exerted them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible on the occa&s;ion: the latter is wounded in the thigh, but in a good way of doing well. The lo&s;s we &s;uffered in our retreat was very incon&s;iderable, as the fire of the &s;hips covered it. The weather has been &s;o bad ever &s;ince the 8th, that I have not been able to get returns from the &s;e|veral corps, &s;o I cannot a&s;certain our lo&s;s; but I believe there are near 500 killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the honour of writing to you the 29th of <HI>March,</HI> when I left <HI>Spithead.</HI> It was from that time to the 6th in&s;t. before the wind came to the we&s;tward, to enable the fleet to &s;teer in with the coa&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> and that evening I detached &s;ix frigates, in hopes they might in the night get &s;o &s;tationed, as to cut off the enemy's communication with the main land. The next morn|ing the fleet pa&s;&s;ed the &s;outh end of <HI>Bellei&s;le,</HI> clo&s;e along the &s;hore; and at one of the bays by Point <HI>Lomaria,</HI> the General and my&s;elf thought a de&s;cent might be tried: but as the wind was &s;outherly, it could not po&s;&s;ibly be attempted at that time. At twelve o'clock the whole fleet anchored in the great road; when imme|diately I went with Gen. <HI>Hodg&s;on</HI> to the northern part of the i&s;l|and, to be as well informed of the &s;trength of the enemy's works there as the time would admit; and while we were upon this ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;ervice, the &s;hips of war in the road were preparing the flat boats for the reception of the troops; but by the time we got back, it was too late in the day to make any trial.</P>
<P>The 8th the wind north-ea&s;terly, the boats being ready for the reception of the troops, the &s;ignal was made very early in the morning for them to a&s;&s;emble at the rendezvous; and three &s;hips, with two bomb-ve&s;&s;els, were ordered to proceed round the point of <HI>Lomaria,</HI> at the S. E. part of the i&s;land, and attack the fort and other works in the <HI>Sandy Bay</HI> round the before-mentioned point, the place the General and my&s;elf had agreed to have attacked,</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Barrington,</HI> in the <HI>Achilles,</HI> got placed fir&s;t, and &s;oon &s;ilenced the fire from the fort and from the &s;hore; and then, as he was directed, made the &s;ignal of his having done &s;o; when the troops in the boats were pu&s;hed to the landing, with great bri&s;kne&s;s and &s;pirited behaviour, at three different places near to each other, by Capt. <HI>Barton,</HI> whom I ordered to command the boats. But the difficulty of getting footing, and the enemy be|ing &s;trongly intrenched on the heights, and in the little fort, the troops &s;oon met with &s;uch a repul&s;e, that it became nece&s;&s;ary, as well as prudent, to de&s;i&s;t from the attempt for the pre&s;ent, and retire with the flat boats; in which they were well covered by the &s;hips and bombs.</P>
<P>One of the flat boats landed &s;ixty of <HI>Erskine</HI>'s grenadiers, who got up a very difficult place to the top of the hills; where they formed with great &s;kill, but were &s;o immediately routed by a much more numerous body of the enemy, that all attempts to &s;uccour them was ineffectual, any further than the boats bringing from the rocks about twenty of them.</P>
<P>While all this was tran&s;acting, Sir <HI>Thomas Stanhope,</HI> with four &s;hips of war, the battalions of <HI>Gray</HI>'s and <HI>Stuart</HI>'s, with 500 ma|rines in tran&s;ports, were oppo&s;ite <HI>Sauzor,</HI> at the northern part of the i&s;land. the&s;e troops were embarked in the boats, if po&s;&s;ible to divert the enemy from the principal object.</P>
<P>A gale of wind coming on very quick after the retiring from the &s;hore, has occa&s;ioned &s;o much damage among the tran&s;ports, by the lo&s;s of anchors and flat boats, that it takes up a very con&s;iderable time to put things in away to attempt what further may be thought practicable. The lo&s;s of flat boats in the gale is twenty-two, which will render the force of landing much infe|rior to what it was fir&s;t attempted with.</P>
<P>While the repairing and adju&s;ting of the&s;e defects are in hand, I hope &s;ome &s;pot may be agreed upon, where we may be more &s;ucce&s;sful in the attempt, than we were on the 8th; but if not &s;o, I hope his Maje&s;ty will believe I have had nothing more at heart than the exerting the force intru&s;ted to me, in a manner mo&s;t conducive to the honour of his arms.</P>

<P>AS I have ju&s;t had a note from Com. <HI>Keppel,</HI> to inform, me, that a frigate will &s;ail this day for <HI>England,</HI> I have only time to acquaint you, that his Maje&s;ty's troops under my com|mand landed ye&s;terday at five. The enemy's attention was &s;o di&s;tracted with our attempts of landing at different places, where there was the lea&s;t appearance of our being able to &s;ucceed, that it gave Brig. <HI>Lambert</HI> an opportunity of climbing up a rock with a corps I had left with him for that purpo&s;e, if practicable. The difficulty of mounting had made the enemy lea&s;t attentive to that part. <HI>Beauclerk's</HI> grenadiers, with their captain, <HI>Patter&s;on,</HI> got up before they &s;aw what was intended. They immediately march|ed a body of 300 men to attack him. The grenadiers maintained their ground till the re&s;t of Brig. <HI>Lambert</HI>'s got up. We took three bra&s;s field-pieces, and &s;ome wounded pri&s;oners. It is im|po&s;&s;ible for me &s;ufficiently to commend Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI>'s conduct and gallant behaviour on the occa&s;ion; and take the liberty to beg you will permit me to reque&s;t you will recommend him to the King, as an officer de&s;erving his maje&s;ty's favour. Capt. <HI>Patter&s;on</HI> has lo&s;t his arm. I believe our lo&s;s is not above thirty killed.

along a very rugged and broken road. This nece&s;&s;arily took up &s;ome time. However the &s;iege was commenced with vigour: and the garri&s;on, commanded by the chevalier de
<PB N="378" REF="429">
St. Croix. a brave and experienced officer, threatened on their &s;ide a long and ob&s;tinate defence. Nothing in fact was deficient on either part. The enemy made &s;ome &s;allies; one of them with con&s;iderable effect. Major Gen. Craw|ford was made pri&s;oner on this occa&s;ion. But our troops were only animated by the&s;e checks. A furious attack was made upon the enemies lines which covered the town, and they were carried without much lo&s;s; principally by the uncommon intrepidity of a company of marines which had been but newly rai&s;ed, No action of greater &s;pirit and gal|lantry had been performed during the whole war.</P>
<P>The town was now entirely abandoned, and the defence confined to the citadel. It was obvious, that as our fleet prevented all communication with the continent, and there|by cut off all hopes of relief, the place mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be reduced; but the chevalier de St. Croix was re&s;olved to pro|vide for his own honour, when he could not for the pre|&s;ervation of the place entru&s;ted to him, and, &s;ince he could not maintain it, to &s;ell it as dear a po&s;&s;ible. Accordingly there was no mention of yielding, until the 7th of June, when there was no longer the &s;lighte&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;uccour, and the place was by no means &s;afely tenable. Then he capitulated, and the garri&s;on marched out with the honours of war.</P>
<P>Thus was the i&s;land of Bellei&s;le reduced under the En|gli&s;h government, after a defence of two months. In this expedition we had about eighteen hudred men killed and wounded. The lo&s;s mo&s;t regretted was, that of Sir William Peere Williams, a young gentleman of great talents and ex|pectations, and who had made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in par|liament. He had but newly entered into the &s;ervice. He was &s;hot in the night, by having carele&s;sly approached too near a centinel of the enemy. He was the third per&s;on of family whom in this war, the love of enterprize had brought to an honourable death in the&s;e expeditions to the coa&s;t of France.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="430">Whatever difference of opinion might have been en|tertained concerning the value of this conque&s;t, or the price which was paid for it, the rejoicing in London was great and &s;incere. The general and the land and &s;ea offi|cers employed in the expedition were the &s;ubject of very ju&s;t applau&s;e, who with &s;o noble a per&s;everance had &s;trug|gled with, and had overcome &s;uch great difficulties, and who had the &s;pirit, after &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter on their out&s;et, to renew an attack under circum&s;tances nearly as unfavourable as tho&s;e by which they had been at fir&s;t foiled. The city of London addre&s;&s;ed the King on the occa&s;ion. And it was generally expected that this new proof of our &s;uperiority mu&s;t influence the negotiation in our favour. Some how|ever were of opinion, that it would rather exa&s;perate the French, and irritate their pride to renew the&s;e efforts which their misfortunes had &s;lackened when they &s;aw us in the mid&s;t of a treaty making attempts, and carrying places in Old France, and as it were, in the pre&s;ence of that haughty court. However as there was nothing done that was not &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable, no complaint was made, and the treaty proceeded, to all appearance with as much good hu|mour as before.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>England and France agree to treat of a &s;eperate peace. Epo|chas propo&s;ed by England. Court of Vienna agrees. Ob|jects of the negotiation. Propo&s;als of France with regard to Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America. French memorial concerning Spain. Indignation of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter. Engli&s;h an&s;wer to the French memorial.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that though the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles treated &s;eperately, it was hitherto by no means propo&s;ed, that this &s;eperate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;hould lead to a &s;eperate peace. It was no more than a previous arrange|ment for the removal of tho&s;e difficulties, which might prevent the peace of France with England from being uni|ted with the general peace of Europe. But in proportion as the treaty advanced, it became obvious, that the &s;ettling of any terms, which had no reference to the &s;ignature of &s;omething obligatory between the two crowns, could at be&s;t be only void and illu&s;ory, and might in the end even
<PB N="380" REF="431">
prove the &s;ource of dangerous and captious altercations. The Engli&s;h mini&s;ter therefore, before he would agree to that definitively upon any point, and particularly upon the epochas, in&s;i&s;ted upon two preliminary conditions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that every thing, which &s;hould be happily adju&s;ted between the two crowns in relation to their particular war, &s;hall be made obligatory, final, and conclu&s;ive, indepen|dent of the fate of the negotiation of Aug&s;burg.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and France, or preliminary articles to that end, &s;hall be &s;igned and ratified between the date of that memorial and the fir&s;t of the following Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>If the&s;e conditions were accepted, then England on her part con&s;ented to name determinate epochas, to which the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> &s;hould refer; the fir&s;t of July for Europe; the fir&s;t of September for Africa and America; and the fir&s;t of November for the Ea&s;t Indies. The French mini&s;try without conte&s;ting the epochas them&s;elves, complained of the conditions; of the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they &s;aid it departed from the letter and &s;pirit of the memorial of the 26th of March, which was the foundation of the whole treaty; of the &s;econd, on account of the extreme &s;hortne&s;s of the time allotted for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ome difficult and momen|tous points; and the adju&s;tment of matters which regarded a war extended over the four quarters of the globe; for the memorial which contained tho&s;e conditions, was dated on the 17th, and was not received at Paris until the end of June, &s;o that little more than a month was left to obtain the con&s;ent of the court of Vienna to a &s;eperate treaty, to &s;ettle the terms of this treaty, and finally, to ratify it.</P>
<P>If a very uncommon good under&s;tanding had not &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed between her imperial Maje&s;ty and the king of France, it mu&s;t have been very difficult to have received this con|&s;ent. But in fact it was immediately received, and upon one very &s;hort and apparently rea&s;onable condition, "That nothing might be &s;tipulated to the prejudice of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria." But when this condition came to be explain|ed, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently, it was &s;o far from faciliating, that it created new ob&s;tacles to the peace. However, this acquie&s;cence of the principal of her allies, enabled France to accept of the fir&s;t condition without re&s;erve; and to the la&s;t &s;he verbally, though not in the cleare&s;t terms, agreed al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="432">Things &s;eemed for the pre&s;ent in the be&s;t &s;ituation, which in this &s;tage of the treaty could be expected. The ba&s;is of the negotiation was &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The article <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> &s;ince the taking Bellei&s;le, was a matter of le&s;s difficulty, and the epochas were in general &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, as to coincide with the de&s;igns and de&s;ires of both parties. The treaty was confined to the two powers, and it was to be perfectly definitive as to them. A time for concluding it, was al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure &s;ettled; a cir|cum&s;tance, which if it did not admit &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, cut off however the opportunities of chicane, and &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t &s;uitable to a candid proceeding, and a &s;incere de&s;ire of peace.</P>
<P>The foundation being thus laid, the &s;uper&s;tructure was the next con&s;ideration. This &s;uper&s;tructure con&s;i&s;ted in the adju&s;tment of tho&s;e compen&s;ations which were to be made for the reciprocal conque&s;ts (and here the difficulty lay) of the two powers; a punctilio of honour might have intervened at the very fir&s;t &s;etting out, extremely pernici|ous to the &s;alutary work in hand; from which party the fir&s;t propo&s;ition &s;hould proceed? But in this re&s;pect France gave way, and that conce&s;&s;ion afforded no incon&s;iderable proof of her pacific intentions.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t apprize the reader that we do not mean to enter exactly into the whole detail of this negotiation, nor undertake preci&s;ely to de&s;cribe all the turns that were taken in it. This, we imagine, would prove a tedious and un|acceptable performance. We &s;hall attach our&s;elves to the capital objects which were contended for in this game of policy: We &s;hall endeavour to point out the matters which fir&s;t ob&s;tructed, and then finally broke off the treaty; and we &s;hall re&s;t on the&s;e things in &s;uch a manner, as &s;eems to us fitte&s;t for marking out the true &s;pirit of the negotiating powers. Our own ob&s;ervations &s;hall be very &s;paringly interpo&s;ed. We are hi&s;torians, and not advocates.</P>
<P>The <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> being &s;ettled as the ba&s;is of the treaty, nothing could rea&s;onably be claimed by either party, that was not to be counterpoi&s;ed by &s;ome equivalent from the other; and con&s;equently it was nece&s;&s;ary to adju&s;t and va|lue their &s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, preten&s;ions and demands. There were &s;ix principal objects in this negotiation. Fir&s;t, the limits of the two crowns in North America. Secondly, the conque&s;ts of Great Britain in the We&s;t-Indies, (toge|ther
<PB N="382" REF="433">
with the Neutral I&s;lands there.) Thirdly, our con|que&s;ts in Africa and in India. Fourthly, the adju&s;tment of the particular affair between the Engli&s;h and French in Germany. Fifthly, the conduct which the two crowns were to hold with regard to their re&s;pective allies in Ger|many. And la&s;tly, the re&s;titution of the captures made by England, previous to the declaration of war.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of the&s;e articles, France propo&s;ed to cede and guaranty all Canada to England; &s;tipulating only that the free and publick exerci&s;es of the Roman Catholick reli|gion &s;hould be permitted under the Engli&s;h government, and that tho&s;e of the old French coloni&s;ts who cho&s;e to re|tire might have leave to tran&s;port them&s;elves from thence, and take away or di&s;po&s;e of their effects. In compen&s;ation for this, they required a confirmation of the privilege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what fi&s;hing they enjoyed on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland, under the treaty of Utrecht; and that this fi&s;hery might be carried on with advantage, they likewi&s;e required the re&s;titution of the i&s;le of Cape Breton, excluding them&s;elves in return from erecting on that i&s;land any kind of fortifica|tion what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The affairs in the We&s;t-Indies, which make the &s;econd capital object, they propo&s;ed to &s;ettle in this manner. They offered to exchange Minorca for Guadaloupe and Marigalante; and as to the four Neutral I&s;lands, they in|&s;i&s;ted that two of them, Dominica and St. Vincent, were held by their natural inhabitants the Carribees, under the protection of France, and that they ought &s;till to remain in the &s;ame condition. With regard to the two others, they propo&s;ed to make a fair divi&s;ion; that St. Lucia &s;hould re|main to France, and that England &s;hould enter into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Tobago. On this head it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that in the opinion of &s;ome people, our mini&s;try did not, in this treaty, &s;et the ju&s;t value on the acqui&s;ition they had made; when they looked upon Canada as the great and leading object, and only con&s;idered Guadaloupe and Mari|galante in a &s;econdary and &s;ubordinate light. This is a que&s;tion of difficulty, and has been much agitated. Tho&s;e who dread a fre&s;h American war from the ambition of France, and were &s;truck with the idea of extended empire, preferred the former conque&s;t; tho&s;e who &s;olely con&s;ider|ed our intere&s;t as a commercial people, were generally in favour of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="434">On the &s;ide of Africa, France &s;atisfied her&s;elf with de|manding either the &s;ettlement at Senegal, or the i&s;le of Goree: for which (together with the re&s;toration of Belle|i&s;le) they con&s;ented to evacuate Gottingen, He&s;&s;e and Ha|nau, and to draw off their army to the Maine and the Rhine. This was certainly a full equivalent. But with regard to the Ea&s;t-Indies, they had no tolerable equivalent to offer. They expatiated much in their memorial upon the di&s;advantages which mu&s;t ari&s;e to the companies of the two nations, from their entertaining views of conque&s;t, &s;o contrary to the true &s;pirit, and the real intere&s;t of the&s;e trading e&s;tabli&s;hments; and they concluded by propo&s;ing the treaty, formerly &s;ettled between the &s;ieurs Godcheau and Saunders, as a ba&s;is for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace in A&s;ia. It mu&s;t be remarked, that this treaty had been concluded at a time when the affairs of France in the Ea&s;t Indies made a figure very different from their pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation; and therefore it &s;eemed unfair to make this treaty a &s;tandard under circum&s;tances altogether inapplicable.</P>
<P>The war, which has been &s;o long, with &s;o much blood|&s;hed and &s;o fruitle&s;sly carried on in We&s;tphalia, the French &s;trenuou&s;ly contended, was from the time of (what they called) the breach of the capitulation of Clo&s;ter-Seven, a war purely Engli&s;h; and therefore that their conque&s;ts in that part of Germany, formed a proper compen&s;ation for the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts in the other quarters of the world. Our mini&s;ters did not attempt formally to refute this a&s;&s;er|tion; they rather &s;eemed to admit it; and they agreed ac|cordingly to receive the evacuation of the&s;e places as an equivalent for ce&s;&s;ions to be made on the footing we have already mentioned. On this point there was little diffi|culty.</P>
<P>The intricate and knotty part was on what we have &s;ta|ted as the fifth object; the conduct of the two crowns with regard to their allies. Here was a real, a capital difficulty. From the beginning of the negotiation, England had de|clared that they would inviolably pre&s;erve their faith to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and would act &s;trenuou&s;ly in his &s;upport. This picqued the French mini&s;ters; who, in their turn, thought them&s;elves bound to make a declaration equally &s;trong in favour of the empre&s;s; and they had, moreover, recently conditioned with the court of Vienna, to admit nothing in the treaty to her di&s;advantage; words of great
<PB N="384" REF="435">
latitude. However, in this difficulty, they found out a &s;olution, which it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, had a very fair and captivating appearance. They propo&s;ed that both armies in Germany &s;hould ob&s;erve an exact neutrality; and &s;hould be reciprocally bound to afford no &s;ort of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor to give no &s;ort of offence to the allies of either of the parties And they propo&s;ed further, that as armies in this &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|inert neutrality mu&s;t be a dead and u&s;ele&s;s expence to the power who maintains them, the French king, from the time his Britannic maje&s;ty recalled the Engli&s;h forces from Germany, would cau&s;e double the number of French for|ces from the armies of the Upper and Lower Rhine to re|turn into France; and that no French troops &s;hould remain in Germany but in proportion to tho&s;e which the king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> England &s;hould keep in his pay. It might certainly be urged in confirmation of the propriety of this offer, that is reality the&s;e armies, whil&s;t they continued in action, though they worried each other abundantly, afforded no kind of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to their allies, and therefore, when they came mu|tually to entertain pacific &s;entiments concerning their own particular quarrel, and were to give an example of modera|tion to the re&s;t of Europe, there &s;eemed to be no rea&s;on why they &s;hould make efforts in favour of any ally which they had not made, or been able to make in the hotte&s;t time of ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The la&s;t article had its difficulties al&s;o. The French in&s;i&s;ted, as a point from which they were re&s;olved never to recede, upon the re&s;titution of the captures made before the declaration of war. This demand, they were of opini|on, was grounded on the cleare&s;t principles of the law of nations, and the mo&s;t expre&s;s &s;tipulation of treaties. With|out entering into the&s;e various arguments with which this po&s;ition might be maintained and attacked, it appeared to many that the honour of both nations was almo&s;t equally concerned, the one to claim, the other as re&s;olutely to re|fu&s;e this re&s;titution.</P>
<P>On the whole, the&s;e propo&s;als, which the French &s;ent to London in a memorial of the 15th of July, formed, tho' in &s;ome re&s;pects undoubtedly exceptionable, a very agree|able plan for a treaty of peace. A better could not have been expected in the fir&s;t project of an enemy, and it might be hoped, that a negotiation thus favourably begun, could not fail of adju&s;ting ea&s;ily whatever appeared wrong, or
<PB N="385" REF="436">
&s;upplying whatever was defective in this fir&s;t draught of the propo&s;itions. But fatally for the repo&s;e of mankind, in the very in&s;tant that this fair propo&s;al was made, at the ve|ry moment when the&s;e &s;trong demon&s;trations were given, an act was done which blew up at one explo&s;ion, the whole ba&s;is of the treaty that had been long and carefully laying, &s;cattered the materials which had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly col|lected, and &s;o cautiou&s;ly arranged, and in&s;tead of extin|gui&s;hing, &s;pread the flames of war more widely, and made them rage with new fury. From this time forward all the tran&s;action was full of animo&s;ity, re&s;entment and mi&s;tru&s;t. The reader has been apprized of the mea&s;ures which France had been invariably pur&s;uing at the court of Ma|drid, and the arguments &s;he employed to infu&s;e a jealou&s;y into that court. Hitherto however, there was no appear|ance that the&s;e mea&s;ures had any effect; but to the infinite &s;urprize and indignation of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, together with the memorial which contained the above recited pro|po&s;itions, Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, the French agent, delivered a private memorial, &s;ignifying, that in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the peace upon &s;olid foundations, not to be &s;haken by the conte&s;ted intere&s;ts of a third power, the king of Spain might be in|vited to accede to guaranty the treaty, and that to prevent the differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great Britain and this monarchy from being a means of producing a fre&s;h war in Europe, with the con&s;ent and communication of his Ca|tholic maje&s;ty, he propo&s;es, that in this negotiation, the three points, which had been di&s;puted between the crowns of England and Spain, might be finally &s;ettled. Fir&s;t, the re&s;titution of &s;ome captures made upon the Spani&s;h flag. Secondly, the privilege of the Spani&s;h nation to fi&s;h on the banks of Newfoundland. Thirdly, the demolition of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements made on the Spani&s;h territories in the bay of Honduras.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined, from the character of the then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in what manner he received the&s;e propo&s;als: he rejected with the utmo&s;t &s;corn, the offer of negotiating, through an enemy humbled, and almo&s;t at his feet, the di&s;putes of his nation, with a power actually in friend&s;hip with us. He called upon the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter to di&s;avow the propo&s;itions, which had been &s;aid to be made with the knowledge of his court. He returned as wholly in admi&s;&s;ible this offen&s;ive memorial, declaring, that it would
<PB N="386" REF="437">
be looked upon as an affront to the dignity of his ma&s;ter, and incompatible with the &s;incerity of the negotiation, to make any further mention of &s;uch a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>And now he prepared, without delay, an an&s;wer to the principal memorial, in a &s;tile rather dictated by the circum|&s;tances which accompanied that paper, and which &s;uffici|ently indicated the de&s;igns of France, than what the pro|po&s;itions them&s;elves &s;trictly de&s;erved. Indeed, as he had by this time conceived an incurable &s;u&s;picion of the &s;ince|rity of France in the whole proceeding, it would not have been prudent to have made tho&s;e advances, which on a &s;uppo&s;ition of good faith and pacific intentions, might po&s;&s;i|bly have been advi&s;eable; for though both powers had over and over declared, that their re&s;pective propo&s;itions, if the treaty &s;hould by any accident be broken off, would be con|&s;idered as retracted or never made; yet it is certain, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> things once &s;ettled and agreed to, unavoidably &s;tamp their own impre&s;&s;ion upon any future negotiation, relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's an&s;wer, which is dated on the 29th of July, agrees to the re&s;titution of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and Bellei&s;le, on the compen&s;ations propo&s;ed by France. It agrees al&s;o to receive Canada, but without any new limits or any exception what&s;oever; and it adds to the French offer of all Canada, "its appurtenances." It admits the propo&s;al of the partition of the Neutral I&s;lands. It rejects the French demand of Cape Breton, or of any other i&s;land in the gulph or river of St. Lawrence; or of any power of fi&s;hing in that river, in that gulph, or on tho&s;e coa&s;ts; and it allows the privilege of fi&s;hing on the banks of Newfound|land, only on con&s;ideration of the demolition of Dunkirk. But the propo&s;ed re&s;titution either of Senegal or Goree, is utterly refu&s;ed. The German neutrality is rejected with di&s;dain; and it is declared that Great Britain is unalterably re&s;olved to &s;upport the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with efficacy and good faith. In addition to the offer made to evacuate He&s;&s;e, &amp;c. it is in&s;i&s;ted that the French &s;hall make a general eva|cuation of all her conque&s;ts in We&s;tphalia, and all its coun|tries, including its conque&s;ts from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia on the Rhine, though France had before declared, that they were conquered for the queen of Hungary, that they were actually governed in her name, and that &s;he could not, con|&s;i&s;tently with good faith, agree to deliver them to the king
<PB N="387" REF="438">
of Pru&s;&s;ia. The treaty between Saunders and Godcheau was not admitted as a proper ba&s;is for a treaty relative to the Ea&s;t Indies. But it was agreed, that the two compa|nies &s;hould negotiate concerning their re&s;pective intere&s;ts, as the king of Great Britain could not di&s;po&s;e of the rights of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company without their con&s;ent. As to the re&s;titution of the captures before the war, this was mo&s;t po&s;itively refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this period we leave the negotiation to follow the mo|tions of the armies in Germany. It is certain, that the di&s;|po&s;itions of the two courts grew daily more unfavourable: their confidence in each other, and their mutual good-will wore away; and it was to be feared, that this negotiation, if it broke off in an un&s;atisfactory manner, mu&s;t leave im|pre&s;&s;ions on the minds of the two nations of &s;uch a nature, as might cau&s;e them to wi&s;h they had never engaged in it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALthough the great purpo&s;e of the early and &s;trenuous effort made by the allies was not fully an&s;wered, it neverthele&s;s produced, as we have before ob&s;erved, a very con&s;iderable and u&s;eful effect. The de&s;truction of the French magazines retarded their operations in &s;uch a man|ner, that the greate&s;t part of the month of June was &s;pent before their armies found them&s;elves in a condition to act. But as &s;oon as they had taken proper mea&s;ures for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, the prince of Soubi&s;e cau&s;ed his troops to pa&s;s the Rhine, and to advance on the &s;ide of Mun&s;ter, not far from which city the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick was po&s;ted to oppo&s;e him. Mar&s;hal Broglio a&s;&s;embled the for|ces
<PB N="388" REF="439">
under his command at Ca&s;&s;el, and moved towards the Dymel, in order to effect a junction with the body under the prince of Soubi&s;e. They made no doubt that their con|joining &s;trength would &s;oon attain a decided &s;uperiority over the allies, who had ended their late enterprize with a lo&s;s which was con&s;iderable, and which in their circum&s;tances, they could not well bear, nor ea&s;ily &s;upply.</P>
<P>The&s;e hopes were &s;upported by the &s;ucce&s;s of their fir&s;t en|counter. General Sporcken with a &s;trong detachment had been po&s;ted in an advantageous &s;ituation on the Dymel, and in the front of the allied army. On the approach of Mar|&s;hal Broglio, he attempted to retire with all that expedition which his inferiority made nece&s;&s;ary. But the French came upon him with &s;uch rapidity,

 <MILESTONE N="June 29."> 

 that they overtook and attacked his rear, which was in&s;tantly routed; they took 800 pri&s;oners, 19 pieces of can|non, 400 hor&s;es, and upwards of 170 waggons. The &s;ame day they pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel; and whil&s;t prince Ferdinand, di&s;couraged by this check, fell back to the Lippe, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Warburg,

 <MILESTONE N="July 2."> 

 Drin|gleburg, and Paderborn.</P>
<P>The allies, however, &s;oon recovered their &s;pirits; and the main body of their army being well &s;ecured, they &s;ent out &s;everal detachments. Their &s;mall bodies were conduct|ed by General Luckner, and other able partizans, who un|dertook &s;everal bold and very di&s;tant enterprizes, attacked the enemy where they were lea&s;t upon their guard, routed their convoys, de&s;troyed &s;everal of their magazines, carri|ages and hor&s;es, and carried off their prey even from the gates of Ca&s;&s;el. The&s;e lively actions &s;eemed a prelude to &s;ome more important and deci&s;ive attempt.</P>
<P>The French became &s;en&s;ible that a &s;troke of &s;ome im|portance was expected from the greatne&s;s of their force, and that it was not for the credit of their arms only, but for their &s;ecurity from the minute, but continual and galling attempts of parties from the allied army.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time prince Ferdinand had been po&s;ted to the &s;outh of the Lippe, between Ham and Lip&s;tadt. This po|&s;ition he took, in all probability, becau&s;e M. Broglio had, by occupying the places on the Dymel, got between him and Hanover. Therefore he judged it expedient for him in his turn to get between the prince de Soubi&s;e and the Rhine. In this &s;ituation, if the enemy attempted any
<PB N="389" REF="440">
movement towards the king's dominions, he was ready to fall directly on the places they occupied by that river, which, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, were full as impor|tant to them as the Hanoverian territory was to us. Thus whil&s;t he &s;eemed to retire from that territory, and in a manner to abandon it, he in reality provided with the greater effect for its &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Broglio, when he had re&s;olved on the attack of the allied army, united his troops to tho&s;e of the prince de Soubi&s;e, at a place called Soe&s;t, between Lip&s;tadt and Ham. On the other hand, as &s;oon as the general of the allies was apprized of their intention he po&s;ted his army in a very &s;trong and advantageous manner.</P>
<P>The river Ae&s;t runs for a con&s;iderable way, almo&s;t paral|lel to the Lippe, from which it is not di&s;tant in &s;ome pla|ces, much more than half a mile. The high road from Lip&s;tadt, to Ham pa&s;&s;es between the&s;e rivers; and it was of the utmo&s;t moment to prince Ferdinand to &s;ecure that im|portant communication by which, alone he could hope an advantageous retreat, or in any degree propo&s;e to command the adjacent country. With a view therefore to protect that communication, he e&s;tabli&s;hed his left wing on the I&s;thmus between the rivers. The left extremity of that wing under General Wutgenau, leaning to the Lippe, by which it was perfectly &s;ecured, as the right was &s;upported by the village of Kirch Denkern, &s;ituated immediately on the Ae&s;t. The marquis of Granby commanded in that wing, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lieutenant general Howard and the prince of Anhalt, who were po&s;ted towards the above-mentioned village.</P>
<P>At that village another river called the Saltzbach, &s;mall, but very deep, joins the Ae&s;t almo&s;t in a right angle. Be|hind this river on a con&s;iderable eminence was placed the centre commanded by general Conway; and on the con|tinuation of the &s;ame eminence, the right wing, under the hereditary prince, &s;tretched out towards the village of Werle, and it was well defended on the flank by rugged, bu&s;hy, and almo&s;t impracticable ground. Nothing could be more advantageous than this di&s;po&s;ition of the army, by which the whole centre and right wing were covered in front by the river, and the left &s;upported by rivers on both its flanks. In the left indeed was the &s;trength and flower of the army; the count of Lippe had placed al&s;o in this
<PB N="390" REF="441">
wing, the greate&s;t part of the artillery, as he knew that it defended the mo&s;t important &s;ituation, was the mo&s;t expo|&s;ed in front, and con&s;equently would be the object of the enemy's mo&s;t con&s;iderable efforts.</P>
<P>He was not mi&s;taken in his conjecture. On the 15th of July, in the evening, a very furious attack was made on lord Granby's po&s;ts, which was &s;u&s;tained for a long time with all the intrepidity and firmne&s;s, which Briti&s;h troops always exert, and which that gallant officer knows &s;o well how to in&s;pire. The di&s;po&s;ition we have ju&s;t men|tioned, was not then compleated; &s;o that they had the whole torrent of that impetuo&s;ity, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the French in their fir&s;t attacks, to re&s;i&s;t for &s;ome hours, until Wutgenau, according to the plan originally projected, ar|rived to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then with efforts united and redoubled in a long and ob&s;tinate combat, which continued untill it was quite dark, they repul&s;ed the French and drove them into the woods.</P>
<P>By the next morning, the di&s;po&s;ition of the al|lies was perfected;

 <MILESTONE N="July 16."> 

 and it was evident that the French, far from being di&s;mayed by their misfor|tune, were preparing for a more general and better &s;u&s;tain|ed attack than the former. M. Broglio commanded again&s;t our left, which, as on the preceeding day, was the princi|pal object of the enemy. The prince de Soubi&s;e led their centre on their left. The engagement began at three in the morning, and it was a &s;evere and continued fire for upwards of five hours, before the lea&s;t effect could be per|ceived on either &s;ide. The weight of the attack this day lay on Wutgenau's corps, which &s;upported it with a degree of bravery, that rivaled the &s;tand which had been lately made by the Briti&s;h forces. But about nine, the prince di&s;covered that the enemy were preparing to erect batteries on an emminence, in the front of the Marquis of Gran|by's camp, which he had not been able to enclo&s;e within his lines. Sen&s;ible of the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity there was of preventing the enemy from &s;eizing on an eminence, from whence they might cruelly gall his army, he called in a re|&s;erve, which had been placed at the other &s;ide of the Lippe under general Sporcken. Strengthened by this &s;upply, and encouraged by the irre&s;olution which now began to appear in the motions of the enemy, he commanded the troops which were neare&s;t at hand to advance upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="442">This movement was deci&s;ive, the enemy gave way, fell into di&s;order, and retired with precipitation. Their centre and left, which had not been able to pa&s;s the Saltzbach, after a long and effectual cannonade, retired with the re&s;t, and covered their retreat; &s;o that favour'd by this circum|&s;tance, and the clo&s;ene&s;s of the country, which was full of hedges, they marched off in tolerable order, and were pur|&s;ued but a little way. However, their lo&s;s was con&s;idera|ble: the Regiment of Rouge, con&s;i&s;ting of four battalions, with its cannon and colours, was entirely taken by the &s;in|gle battalion of Maxwell. Their whole lo&s;s in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, has been e&s;timated at 5000. The allies had about 300 killed, 1000 wounded, and about 200 pri&s;oners. This action was the climax of the campaign of 1761

<P>ON the 15th of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>French</HI> attacked the light troops in the front of Lord <HI>Granby</HI>'s corps, which was encamped on the heights of <HI>Kirch Denckern.</HI> His Lord&s;hip ordered the regi|ments of <HI>Cornwallis, Keith, Campbell,</HI> and <HI>Marsberg,</HI> to the left to &s;upport the po&s;ts. There was an uninterupted fire of cannon and &s;mall arms, till nine at night, when it cea&s;ed, without any impre&s;&s;ion having been made by the enemy upon Lord <HI>Granby</HI>'s left.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 16th, about three o'clock the canno|nading began very bri&s;kly on both &s;ides, and continued till nine, when the enemy gave way in great di&s;order. His mo&s;t &s;e|rene highne&s;s the Duke, then ordered the corps of the prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> Lord <HI>Granby</HI> and <HI>Wutgenau,</HI> to attack them on their retreat; which they did with &s;o much vigour that the enemy ne|ver attempted to form before them, but threw down their arms and ran off in the utmo&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>When major <HI>Wedderbourn</HI> came away, there were &s;ix colours already taken, eleven or twelve pieces of cannon; many officers, among&s;t whom the Comte <HI>de Rouge,</HI> and great part of the regi|ments of <HI>De Rouge, Dauphin,</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> to the amount of 3000 men.</P>
<P>After having pur&s;ued them about a league, the duke ordered the troops to form upon the heights of <HI>Kirch Denckern.</HI> The he|reditary prince was &s;till driving the enemy on their left. Pri&s;on|ers and cannon, were coming in every moment.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that the Mar&s;hal <HI>duc de Broglio</HI> commanded on the right of the <HI>French</HI> army, oppo&s;ite to the prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> Lord <HI>Granby,</HI> and Lieutenant General <HI>Wutgenau,</HI> where his &s;erene hignne&s;s was in per&s;on.</P>

<PB N="392" REF="443">
wi&s;dom of the accompli&s;hed commander in the di&s;po&s;ition, and to the bravery of the troops in the combat; but it was far from deci&s;ive. Notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s the French &s;uffered, they were &s;till much &s;uperior, in their numbers. On this misfortune the old ill under&s;tanding between Sou|bi&s;e and Broglio broke out with fre&s;h animo&s;ity. Narratives, memorials, and replies, conceived with great bitterne&s;s, were mutually remitted from both mar&s;hals to their court. Mar&s;hal Broglio alledged, that his misfortune was owing to the prince de Soubi&s;e's delay, who did not begin the attack till it was too late for him to continue it; the prince de Soubi&s;e, on the other hand, &s;ugge&s;ted, that Broglio began his attack earlier than the time that had been fixed, in hopes of forcing the allies without Soubi&s;e's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and when he found that point lo&s;t, obliged Soubi&s;e to retreat, that he might not have the honour of recovering it.</P>
<P>The allies after this battle kept their ground for &s;ome time, whil&s;t the French retreated. It is impo&s;&s;ible regular|ly to account for all the unexpected turns which have hap|pened, perhaps, more in this campaign, than in any of the former. It is enough to know that the original &s;uperiority of the French, together with their opportunity of con|tinual reinforcement, may very tolerably explain the rea&s;on
<PB N="393" REF="444">
of the advantages which they &s;o often obtained after very con&s;iderable defeats. This is a point which it is nece&s;&s;ary the reader &s;hould continually keep in his mind during the whole narration of this &s;trange war. After their late lo&s;s and retreat, the French &s;oon advanced again. The party under the prince de Soubi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Lippe, and made di&s;po&s;itions for the &s;iege of Mun&s;ter, whil&s;t mar&s;hal Bro|glio's army turned off on the other &s;ide, cro&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and threatened to fall in upon Hanover.</P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of the enemy compelled prince Ferdinand, though little in a condition for it, to divide his army al&s;o. The hereditary prince po&s;ted him&s;elf to cover Mun&s;ter; whil&s;t prince Ferdinand continued in the country towards the We&s;er, to ob&s;erve the motions of mar&s;hal Broglio.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e various po&s;itions were mutually taken, as the armies were continually moving near each other, a number of very &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued. Mar&s;hal Broglio cautiou&s;ly avoided a battle whenever he &s;aw that the duke of Brun&s;wick, by calling together his troops, had prepared for, and was de&s;irous of it; &s;o that there was no way left, but if po&s;&s;ible, to check his motions, and wear down his force, by reiterated le&s;&s;er actions

 the di&s;appointment of &s;uch great hopes as were formed from the ri&s;ing gallantry of a prince, who &s;o nobly &s;upported the martial &s;pirit of his family, and had fallen whil&s;t he was emulating the heroic actions of his brother the hereditary prince and his uncle Ferdinand.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of We&s;tphalia, the prince de Soubi&s;e per&s;e|vered, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome checks, in his de&s;ign of laying &s;iege to Mun&s;ter; there was great rea&s;on to apprehend that he might &s;ucceed in that enterprize, as it was always in mar&s;hal Broglio's power, by taking &s;ome &s;teps on the &s;ide of Hanover, to make it nece&s;&s;ary to draw away the great|e&s;t part of the force de&s;tined to the &s;uccour of Mun&s;ter. He therefore began to make the previous arrangements at Dor|&s;ten.

which were e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and by this means not only fru&s;trated their de&s;ign of be&s;ieging Mun&s;ter, but compelled them for a time, to retire from the Lippe.</P>
<P>As to prince Ferdinand, he &s;aw clearly, that the inten|tions of mar&s;hal Broglio were to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his maje&s;ty's, and the duke of Brun&s;wick's territories. To at|tempt to follow him, and to beat him from thence, would only be irrecoverably to transfer the &s;eat of war into tho&s;e countries, and wholly to abandon We&s;tphalia to the enemy. Diver&s;ion therefore, and not direct oppo&s;ition, became his object. He re&s;olved, that as often as he perceived mar&s;hal Broglio making any progre&s;s on the &s;u&s;pected quarter, he &s;hould throw him&s;elf as far into He&s;&s;e as the enemy had ad|vanced towards Hanover, and by &s;topping their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, oblige them to quit their enterprize. This plan at fir&s;t &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes, and drew back mar&s;hal Broglio into He&s;&s;e, upon who&s;e approach prince Ferdinand retired to his old quarters at Paderborn, and ready for a new movement as &s;oon as Broglio &s;hould return to the execution of his former de&s;ign.

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 19."> 

</P>
<P>Accordingly he &s;oon returned to the We&s;er. Then the hereditary prince, who had by this time re-joined the grand army, advanced into He&s;&s;e, and pu&s;hed to the farthe&s;t ex|tremities of that country, even as far as Fritzlar; but tho' he &s;ucceeded &s;o far in his attempts as to de&s;troy all the le&s;|&s;er magazines which he found in the open country; yet as all the fortre&s;&s;es were in the hands of the enemy, as the garri&s;ons had been newly reinforced and the grand maga|zines were well &s;ecured in tho&s;e places, he kept his ground in his advanced po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was on this occa&s;ion principally that prince Ferdinand found the di&s;advantage of not being able to form two ar|mies, which might act &s;eperately. For on one hand, mar|&s;hal Broglio, when he had perfectly &s;ecured his po&s;ts in He&s;&s;e, took a &s;ituation in which he watched all the motions of prince Ferdinand, and kept him&s;elf in readine&s;s to fall back into He&s;&s;e, or to advance into Hanover, as might be&s;t agree with his de&s;igns. From hence he &s;ent out &s;ome pow|erful detachments which acted with great effect. One of the&s;e detachments entered the Harts Fore&s;t (the remains of the great Hercynian, &s;o famous among the antients) and be&s;ieged the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Schartsfelts, which they took and demoli&s;hed. Then they laid the whole tract of country
<PB N="396" REF="449">
under &s;evere contribution. Another, and &s;till more powerful detachment under prince Xavier of Saxony appeared be|fore Wolfenbuttle, a con&s;iderable city, and &s;trongly &s;ituated,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 5."> 

 as it is wholly &s;urrounded by the Ocker. But the French, as they knew that the town is mo&s;tly built of wood, commenced their opera|tions with a very fierce bombardment. This had &s;uch an effect, that the re&s;i&s;tance of the place was not proportioned to its &s;trength; in five days it &s;urrendered, and was &s;ubject, like the re&s;t, to a grievous contribution.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, the French followed their blow, and advanced, keeping &s;till the cour&s;e of the Ocker, to Brun&s;wick; and began al&s;o to inve&s;t that city. The reigning prince, unable to protect his &s;ubjects, or to &s;ecure his per&s;on in his dominions, fled to Hamburgh, where he met the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, whom the rage of war had in the &s;ame manner driven from his territories. This free ci|ty now became a place of general refuge, and enriched it|&s;elf by the calamities, as it had in better times done by the pro&s;perity of Germany. It was lately computed, that the &s;trangers there had increa&s;ed to 40,000, among&s;t whom they could reckon two &s;overeign princes, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>This rapid and unre&s;i&s;ted progre&s;s of the French to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, was to the highe&s;t degree alarming. Prince Ferdinand with all the expedition in his power, de|tached the hereditary prince to the relief of Brun&s;wick. This mea&s;ure fortunately &s;aved that very important place. This active commander compelled the enemy not only to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Brun&s;wick, but to abandon Wolfenbuttel, and to make a precipitate retreat with the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their cannon, and upwards of 1000 men.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Broglio's detachments proceeded thus in di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing the country to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, the prince of Soubi&s;e, who by the removal of the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick to another quarter, &s;aw no longer any thing ca|pable of oppo&s;ing him, &s;pread his army by detachments over all We&s;tphalia, and ravaged it in the mo&s;t cruel man|ner. They took O&s;nabrug; and becau&s;e the contributions were not immediately paid, they gave up the place to be pillaged by their troops, who rifled the mi&s;erable inhabitants without mercy. Another body pu&s;hed as far as Embden. This important town was immediately &s;urrendered by the
<PB N="397" REF="450">
garri&s;on (two Engli&s;h companies of invalids) at the de&s;ire of the timid inhabitants, and the promi&s;e of a favourable treatment: notwith&s;tanding this capitulation, and the merit of &s;o ea&s;y a &s;urrender, the town, as well as the whole coun|try of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, was laid under a ruinous contribu|on. But their exorbitances grew to &s;uch an extremity, that the boors were at length compelled to ri&s;e, and with &s;uch arms as a &s;udden rage &s;upplied them, to drive the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors out of their country.</P>
<P>A more con&s;iderable corps commanded by the prince de Conde, laid &s;iege to Meppen, a place on the Ems, of &s;ome con&s;equence,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 13."> 

 and where we had &s;ome magazines. In three days it was reduced, and the garri&s;on of five hundred men were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The city of Bremen was defended by a weak garri&s;on. This was a place of far greater moment than Meppen, the allies having ama&s;&s;ed their immen&s;e magazines, as it was a great and trading town, advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on the river We&s;er; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place mu&s;t undoubtedly have given to the French the command of that river, thro' which the allies derived all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If the Engli&s;h had lo&s;t Bremen, they mu&s;t have &s;een them&s;elves inve&s;ted and locked up in a barren counrry, in the heart of Germa|ny, &s;urrounded by their enemies, and deprived of every re|&s;ource. Fortunately the inhabitants of this city proved as brave as tho&s;e of Embden were timid. They were exa&s;pe|rated by the example of the French rigour, which they had &s;een on every &s;ide of them. They therefore joined the garri&s;on, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging them in the defence of the place. The French were obliged to retire precipitately; and a &s;trong reinforcement was thrown into Bremen, to &s;e|cure that very important city from the like enterprizes for the future.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the two French armies in this manner ravaged all the country held by the allies, prince Ferdinand, who &s;aw the rage of war &s;pread all around him, with his u&s;ual firmne&s;s, kept that central po&s;ition which he had taken &s;oon after the battle of Kirch Denkern; no movements of the enemy could terrify or allure him from it. He had &s;ettled his head quarters at Buhne, and his army extended from thence to|wards Hammelen. Po&s;ted in this manner, he &s;ecured the cour&s;e of the We&s;er, by preventing the enemy from making
<PB N="398" REF="451">
them&s;elves ma&s;ters either of Hammelen or Minden; he lay in the be&s;t &s;ituation in which it was po&s;&s;ible to place a &s;in|gle army, that was to act again&s;t two; and knowing that he could not follow their movements with the body of his army, without hazarding the king's electoral dominions, and indeed every object of the war, he contented him&s;elf with &s;ending out &s;uch detachments as he could &s;pare, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively to the relief of the places which were attacked. He &s;aw that the winter approached, which had always been a circum&s;tance fayourable to him; and it was evident that whil&s;t he continued with his main body immoveably fixed as it was, and his detachments active on every &s;ide, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the enemy to keep any of tho&s;e places, they had &s;eized in their incur&s;ions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>UNTIL this year the operations of the Pru&s;&s;ian armies took the lead in intere&s;t and importance before all the other events of the war. The firmne&s;s and activity of their illu&s;trious monarch, the number and animo&s;ity of his ene|mies, the blows that he gave, and tho&s;e that he &s;uffered, his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and terrible falls, his amazing and almo&s;t miraculous recoveries, kept all eyes fixed on his motions, as the great centre of public attention. Undoubtedly nothing that has ever been acted on the &s;cene of human affairs, at|tracted the minds of men to it with greater ju&s;tice; none perhaps afforded at once more entertainment to the imagi|nation, and furni&s;hed more copious materials for political and military in&s;truction; and probably, therefore, this part of all our modern hi&s;tory, will be the mo&s;t carefully &s;tudied by po&s;terity, when it comes to be properly known, and wor|thily written.</P>
<P>To judge of the importance of this branch of the general
<PB N="399" REF="452">
war, it will be proper to recollect that, be&s;ides a number of &s;ieges which were pro&s;ecuted, together with innumerable and bloody &s;kirmi&s;hes, no le&s;s than nineteen pitched battles, or capital actions, have been fought on his part &s;ince the clo&s;e of the year 1756, when the king of Pru&s;&s;ia fir&s;t &s;eized upon Saxony, and made an iruption into Bohemia. In eleven of the&s;e battles, the King or his generals were de|feated. He was victorious only in eight. Ten of them were fought under his own command; and &s;even out of the eight victories which were gained, were obtained by him|&s;elf in per&s;on; of the eleven defeats, he was pre&s;ent only at three.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;ome judgment may be formed of the active and enterprizing character of this monarch, and of the amazing re&s;ource he had prepared, or formed, or &s;eized, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, one may &s;ay, almo&s;t creat|ed. We have ob&s;erved that the la&s;t campaign had ended more to his advantage than the one preceding had done; for tho&s;e two great victories of Lignitz and Torgau, with which he then ended his operations, had not only re&s;cued his affairs in Sile&s;ia and Saxony from impending de&s;truction, but had enlarged his field for recruiting, and prepared him, to all appearance, for more early and vigorous action, than could have been expected in mo&s;t of the preceding cam|paigns. But every one was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve, that this year he had totally altered the &s;y&s;tem of his conduct. An inactivity and languor was diffu&s;ed over all his proceedings. He &s;eemed to have adopted the caution and &s;lowne&s;s which had been &s;o long oppo&s;ed to his vivacity by M. Daun. The &s;ummer was almo&s;t wholly &s;pent, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had &s;carcely been mentioned.</P>
<P>It was not &s;u&s;pected that the propo&s;ed negotiation at Aug&s;burg could have had much, if any influence upon his method of proceeding. No particular propo&s;als had been made concerning his affairs, nor indeed any other marks of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition towards him &s;hewn, except what were contained in tho&s;e general declarations, which a regard to common decency had exacted. It mu&s;t have added to the anxiety of his &s;ituation, that Great Britain and France were at that time engaged in a &s;eparate treaty, in which the latter power was in a condition to make &s;o many flattering offers in relation to Germany, that he might well have dreaded the withdrawing of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which had hitherto been
<PB N="400" REF="453">
his great &s;upport again&s;t all attacks, and his final re&s;ource in all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Perhaps he was well a&s;&s;ured, that the faith of Great Britain was proof again&s;t every offer, however alluring; in fact it proved to be &s;o; for in rejecting the German neutrality, which the French propo&s;ed in the late negotiation, our country afforded as convincing a proof of an un&s;haken public faith, as any people had ever given to their allies.</P>
<P>However, whil&s;t this point remained in any degree of &s;u&s;pence, it would have appeared natural, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould make &s;ome uncommon exertions to confirm the faith of his allies, as well as to put him&s;elf upon a more re&s;pectable footing at the en&s;uing congre&s;s. It is, notwith|&s;tanding certain, that he contented him&s;elf with acting wholly upon the defen&s;ive; a conduct, which perhaps his circum&s;tances had rendered ab&s;olutely unavoidable. Prince Henry commanded an army in Saxony, which intrenched it&s;elf &s;trongly under Leip&s;ic. M. Daun continued near Dre&s;den; and the&s;e two armies did no more than watch each other during the campaign. The King was al&s;o in|trenched in a very &s;trong po&s;ition in Upper Sile&s;ia, not far from Schweidnitz, whil&s;t the fortre&s;&s;es in the lower part of that country were filled with &s;uch garri&s;ons, as put them out of the reach of any &s;udden in&s;ult.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition was pointed out by the motions and appa|rent de&s;igns of his enemies. The Ru&s;&s;ian army was this year, as well as in the former, divided into two &s;trong bo|dies; one of which, led by Tottleben, directed its march towards Pomerania: and the other under M. Butterlin, en|tered into the upper Sile&s;ia, advancing towards Bre&s;lau Baron Laudohn entered that province in the part oppo&s;ite to them, and they propo&s;ed to unite their armies, in order to attack the King, or to take Bre&s;lau or Schweidnitz in his pre&s;ence. The remarkable drought in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, which had greatly lowered the Oder, facilitated their junction. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;pread them&s;elves over all the open country of Sile&s;ia; and exacted heavy contribu|tions.

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 1."> 

 A body of them appeared before Bre&s;lau, and began to cannonade the town from &s;even bat|teries. Laudohn exerted the whole of his &s;kill to draw the king from his po&s;t, and to engage him in a di&s;advantageous action. Sometimes he advanced, as if he meant to join the Ru&s;&s;ians: &s;ometimes his motions indicated a de&s;ign on Sch|weidnitz;
<PB N="401" REF="454">
the&s;e attempts failing, he turned off and made a feint as if he propo&s;ed to fall upon the Lower Sile&s;ia, in hopes that he might at lea&s;t oblige the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to detach and divide his forces; but the King continued im|moveable in his po&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e various movements were making with little effect, on the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, the other grand divi&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians advanced without oppo&s;ition into Pomerania; and it was expected that their proceedings would be attended with greater effect &s;ince the removal of Tottleben, and the appointment of general Romanzow to the command. Tot|tleben had been long &s;u&s;pected, and, it is &s;aid, at length convicted, of a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The &s;ituation of this Monarch obliged him to fight with every &s;ort of weapon; and Tottleben, a &s;oldier of fortune, without any national attachment or particular allegiance, was a fit object for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's pecu|niary &s;tratagems. He did not &s;ucceed &s;o well in the attempts of the &s;ame kind which he is &s;aid to have made upon Lau|dohn. Every circum&s;tance concurred to render the method of corruption le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in that quarter.</P>
<P>Colberg, regularly be&s;ieged, or clo&s;ely &s;treightened every campaign, &s;ince the Ru&s;&s;ians made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, was now a&s;&s;aulted with greater and more determined force than ever. A &s;trong fleet con&s;i&s;ting of forty &s;ail of all kinds, blockaded it by &s;ea, whil&s;t the army of general Romanzow formed the &s;iege by land. On the other hand, the place threatened a defence worthy of its former efforts. This city was from the beginning of the war of greater &s;trength than it had commonly been repre&s;ented; every attempt of the Ru&s;&s;ians, by demon&s;trating where any weakne&s;s lay, taught the Pru&s;&s;ians, who were fully &s;en&s;ible of its importance, in what part and in what man|ner it was nece&s;&s;ary to add to its works; and they had omitted no opportunity. In addition to this defence, the Prince of Wurtenburg was &s;trongly intrenched under the cannon of the town, with a body of &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was extremely alarmed at the danger of this momentous po&s;t, the key of his dominions to the north, from the relief of which he was removed, and, as it were, chained down, at &s;uch an immen&s;e di&s;|tance. Though Laudohn and Butterlin found abundant
<PB N="402" REF="455">
employment for his forces, he re&s;olved to &s;end a con&s;ider|able detachment under general Platen to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Colberg. The fertility of his genius propo&s;ed two ends from this &s;ingle expedient. He ordered Platen to direct his march through Poland, and to de&s;troy the Ru&s;&s;ian maga|zines, which had been ama&s;&s;ed on the frontiers of that king|dom, and from which their army in Sile&s;ia drew its whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This &s;ervice, might, he hoped, be performed without any con&s;iderable interruption to the progre&s;s of the detachment towards Colberg. The event was entirely an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes. General Platen ruined three principal magazines of the enemy. He attacked a great convoy of their waggons; de&s;troyed 500, and burned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;per&s;ed the provi&s;ions they carried. Four thou&s;and men who protected this convoy, were, for the greater part, killed or made pri&s;oners. General Platen, after this u&s;eful and brilliant exploit, pur&s;ued his march with the utmo&s;t dili|gence to Pomerania.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this blow was no &s;ooner received by the Ru&s;&s;ians in Sile&s;ia, than they were &s;truck with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. They had lately effected one of their purpo&s;es by their junction with the Au&s;tri|ans;

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 25."> 

 but this &s;troke compelled them at once to &s;ever this union, &s;o lately and with &s;uch difficulty compa&s;&s;ed to drop all their de&s;igns upon Bre&s;lau, to repa&s;s the Oder, and to retire without delay into Poland, le&s;t their remaining magazines &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame fate with the three above-mentioned, and there future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence be thereby rendered wholly precarious.</P>
<P>So unfortunately circum&s;tanced were the affairs of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, that his wi&s;e&s;t &s;chemes and happie&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es could hardly an&s;wer any other end than to vary the &s;cene of his di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;torm which had been diverted from Sile&s;ia by general Platen's expedition, was only remov|ed from thence to be di&s;charged with irre&s;i&s;tible fury on Colberg. The Ru&s;&s;ians, when they &s;aw that the mea&s;ures the king had taken, rendered the completion of both their de&s;igns impracticable, re&s;olved at all adventures to &s;ecure one of them. Colberg was the object of their choice, not only as the place furthe&s;t from &s;uccour but as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would be an advantage fitte&s;t for an&s;wering tho&s;e ends which were more nearly and properly Ru&s;&s;ian. M. Buttur|lin, therefore, as &s;oon as he had e&s;tabli&s;hed his convoys, di|rected
<PB N="403" REF="456">
his cour&s;e towards Pomerania, and being ma&s;ter of Lan&s;perg, he &s;ent detachments from thence, that cruelly wa&s;ted all the adjoining Marche of Brandenburg, without at the &s;ame time diverting him&s;elf by the&s;e ravages from his main intention.</P>
<P>A force of Ru&s;&s;ians was by this time a&s;&s;embled in Pome|rania, to which it was impo&s;&s;ible for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to oppo&s;e any thing that was in any degree able to contend with them in the field; of cour&s;e he could not promi&s;e him&s;elf that immediate rai&s;ing the &s;iege could be the effect of the&s;e &s;uccours. All he could do was to &s;end another de|tachment to that part under general Knoblock; and hoped that by the union of the&s;e &s;everal &s;mall corps, and by their intercepting or at lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Ru&s;&s;ian convoys of provi&s;ion, the place might be enabled to hold out, until the &s;evere &s;etting in of winter &s;hould render the operations of a &s;iege impracticable.</P>
<P>He was providing in this manner, and &s;tudying new me|thods for the relief of Colberg, to the danger of which place his whole attention was drawn, when an event happened ju&s;t by him, and, as it were, under his eye, almo&s;t as di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing as the taking of Colberg would have proved, and &s;o much the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as it was entirely unexpected.</P>
<P>On the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ians under Butturlin, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia imagined him&s;elf at liberty. He found a want of provi&s;ions in his &s;trong camp near Schweidnitz, and to be the more ea&s;ily &s;upplied, he aproached nearer to the Oder, He was &s;o little in fear of the enemy, that on making this movement he drafted 4000 men from the garri&s;on of Sch|widnitz: he thought that the preparations nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;iege would give him &s;ufficient notice, and &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to provide for the &s;afety of that important place, from which after all, he had removed but to a very &s;mall di&s;tance. Lau|dohn, who through the whole campaign had watched the king with a mo&s;t diligent and penetrating a&s;&s;iduity, and hitherto had found no part open and unguarded, thought in this in&s;tant he perceived an advantage. It was indeed an advantage which would never have appeared as &s;uch, but to a general as re&s;olute as &s;agacious. He re&s;olved to at|tempt this &s;trong place, by a <HI>coup de main.</HI> On the 1&s;t of October at three in the morning, the a&s;&s;ault began. An attack was made at the &s;ame time on all the four outworks which the troops, ordered on this important enterprize ap|proached
<PB N="404" REF="457">
with &s;o much precaution, that they were not per|ceived by the garri&s;on. They &s;caled all the four at the &s;ame time; and the troops which defended them had &s;carce time to fire a few cannon &s;hot. On the &s;ide of the a&s;&s;ailants, not a gun was di&s;charged: but in one of tho&s;e out-works the fire of the &s;mall arms &s;et fire to a powder magazine, which blew up, and on this occa&s;ion about 300 of the Au|&s;trians, and about the &s;ame number of the Pru&s;&s;ians were killed. As &s;oon at the out-works were carried, they pre|pared to a&s;&s;ault the body of the place, which they entered by bur&s;ting open the gates, and at day-break they found them&s;elves-ma&s;ters of the town after firing a few &s;hot. Five battalions, making about 3000 men, and lieutenant-general Za&s;trow, governor of the fortre&s;s, were made pri|&s;oners. The conquerors found here a great number of can|non, and a large magazine of meal. Their lo&s;s in the whole of this bold and fortunate undertaking amounted, by their accounts, to no more than 600 men.</P>
<P>In a manner &s;o unexpected, and con&s;idering the nature of the fortifications, &s;o unprecedented, Schweidnitz fell for a &s;econd time in this war into the hands of the Au&s;trians; and that city, which in the year 1758 had co&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians a blockade of &s;ome months, and a &s;iege of thirteen days open trenches to recover it, was again lo&s;t in a few hours, and with a very incon&s;iderable damage to tho&s;e who under|took this daring enterprize.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia felt this grievous blow to the quick. By their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Schweidnitz he &s;aw the Au&s;trians en|abled to winter in Sile&s;ia; he &s;aw that whil&s;t they held this place, he could po&s;&s;ibly make no motion for the relief of any other part of his dominions, without expo&s;ing Bre&s;lau, and along with it the whole of Upper Sile&s;ia, to a certain and irrecoverable conque&s;t. In the fir&s;t agitations produced by &s;o extraordinary and affecting a di&s;a&s;ter, he was di&s;po&s;ed to attribute this misfortune to the treachery of the governor, but he was too generous to harbour &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, for any time, again&s;t an officer who had hitherto &s;erved him with fidelity, and who might have been &s;urprized with an attack of &s;o uncommon a nature, and which the king him|&s;elf had as little &s;u&s;pected as the governor. He immediate|ly recovered his temper, and &s;aid with a &s;mile,
<Q>It is a fa|tal blow; we mu&s;t endeavour to remedy it.</Q>
He wrote to general Za&s;trow, who commanded there,
<Q>We may
<PB N="405" REF="458">
now &s;ay, what Francis I. of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia, <HI>We have lo&s;t all except our ho|nour.</HI> As I cannot comprehend what hath happened to you, I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend my judgment; the thing is very extraordinary.</Q></P>
<P>Schweidnitz was lo&s;t &s;uddenly; but Colberg made a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and noble defence, At length, however, the gar|ri&s;on began to be &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions. General Platen quitted the intrenchments, which he had maintained in conjunction with the prince of Wurtenburg, in order to cover the reinforcements, which the numerous and &s;trong detachments of the Ru&s;&s;ians, who over&s;pread the whole country, had hitherto kept at a di&s;tance. But he had the misfortune to meet an infinitely &s;uperior body of the ene|my, to be beaten, and to lo&s;e part of his convoy; and it was with difficulty he e&s;caped with the remainder to Stettin.</P>
<P>The other (general Knoblock) had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at Treptow, which was to &s;erve as a re&s;ting place for the con|voys; but as general Platen had been repul&s;ed, in the man|ner we have ju&s;t &s;een, Romanzow advanced with a large force to Treptow. Knoblock, hopele&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a town which had &s;carcely any walls, and inve&s;ted by a body &s;o va&s;tly &s;uperior, yet made a vigorous and gallant defence for five days; he was at length compelled to &s;urrender him|&s;elf and his body of about 2000 men pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;a&s;ters were occa&s;ioned by the nece&s;|&s;&s;ity there was for revictualling Colberg, co&s;t what it would, for that end, of di&s;per&s;ing the Pru&s;&s;ian troops in the face of a Ru&s;&s;ian army of 50,000 men. The revictualling in the&s;e circum&s;tances could not be effected without a &s;in|gular piece of good fortune; and, in order to get into the way of this good fortune, every ri&s;que was to be run.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages over Platen and Knoblock rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the Ru&s;&s;ians, and enabled them to contend with the extreme rigour of the &s;ea&s;on in that northern latitude; they pu&s;hed the &s;iege with redoubled efforts. All hope of a &s;upply from the land was ab&s;olutely at an end; and though the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet had been by a violent &s;torm driven off the coa&s;t, the &s;uccour from the &s;ea was too precarious to be depended on. In this de&s;perate &s;ituation the prince of Wur|tenburg became apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t his army, which had been unable to relieve the town, by delaying any longer
<PB N="406" REF="459">
under its walls would only &s;hare its fate, and that famine might al&s;o oblige him to &s;urrender. He therefore re&s;olved, whil&s;t his men retained their vigour, to break through a part of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and to leave Colberg to make the be&s;t terms its circum&s;tances would admit. This de&s;ign he accompli&s;hed happily, and with little or no lo&s;s.</P>
<P>

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 16th."> 

And now Colberg, hople&s;s of all relief, the garri&s;on exhau&s;ted, provi&s;ion low, the fortifica|tions in many places battered to pieces, after a long &s;iege of near &s;ix months, &s;urrendered to the Ru&s;&s;ians. The governor and the garri&s;on were made pri&s;oners of war. This place was defended by the gallant <HI>Heyde,</HI> who to this time had maintained it &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t all the efforts of the Ru&s;&s;ians during the war; and as he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the king his ma&s;ter, for his merit in the &s;ucce&s;sful de|fence of it, he had likewi&s;e as full a&s;&s;urances of his favours after having on the late occa&s;ion conducted him&s;elf with his former bravery, though it was not with the former good fortune.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of two &s;uch places as Schweidnitz and Colberg, at the two extremities of his dominions, was deci&s;ive again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. It was now impo&s;&s;ible for him to make any movement by which the enemy could not pro|fit to his almo&s;t certain de&s;truction. To form &s;ieges, with an army like his, inferior in the field, was impo&s;&s;ible. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Colberg, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every thing. They were ma&s;ters of the Baltic; and they now acquired a port, by which their armies could be well provided, without the nece&s;&s;ity of tedious, uncertain, and expen&s;ive convoys from Poland, The road lay almo&s;t open into the heart of Bran|denburg. Stetin alone &s;tood in their way; but it was ob|vious that nothing but the advanced &s;ea&s;on could &s;ave Stetin from the fate of Colberg. The Ru&s;&s;ians, now for the fir&s;t time, took up their winter quarters in Pomerania.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this whole year pa&s;&s;ed without a regular battle between the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and any of his enemies, yet none of the mo&s;t unfortunate of his campaigns had been &s;o ruinous to him. He had &s;uffered four terrible defeats, without having ballanced them with a &s;ingle ad|vantage of con&s;equence in the campaign of 1759. Yet in the&s;e circum&s;tances it is almo&s;t incredible how little he really lo&s;t. He was able to take the field again the en&s;uing year in a very re&s;pectable manner, and to make head
<PB N="407" REF="460">
again&s;t his enemies. In that year he lo&s;t a whole army near Land&s;hut; &s;till he was far from being broken. Af|terwards in that &s;ame campaign, he gave his enemies two &s;ignal defeats, and ended his operations advantageou&s;ly, and with great glory. But in the year, of which we now write, without &s;uffering any con&s;iderable blow in the field, without any &s;triking efforts on any &s;ide, his power has gradually crumbled away. The mo&s;t calamitous defeats could not &s;ink him lower. And in the &s;ituation in which he &s;tood after the taking of Colberg, we may &s;afely &s;ay, that there was &s;carcely a po&s;&s;ibility that he could be pre&s;erved from de&s;truction by any thing that lay within the reach of human endeavours.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The negotiation re&s;umed. French conce&s;&s;ions. Difference concerning the German alliance. Difference concerning the captures antecedent to the declaration of war. Treaty breaks off. Me&s;&s;ieurs Stanley and Bu&s;&s;y recalled.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER having been &s;o long detained on the theatre of war, it is time we &s;hould return to take a view of the negotiation for putting an end to the mi&s;eries it occa|&s;ioned. In reality the view, even of this &s;cene, was very glooming and unpromi&s;ing. The confidence and good hu|mour of the two courts being &s;ubverted, all that followed was rather an altercation than a treaty. It is true, that pa|pers pa&s;&s;ed backward and forward; and the preten&s;ions of each party, the points they agreed to cede, and tho&s;e which they were determined to adhere to, grew more di&s;tinct and explicit. But all that cordiality was vani&s;hed, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary towards &s;moothing and clearing a road, which a long ho&s;tility had broken up, and &s;o many intricate topics had contributed to embarra&s;s.</P>
<P>Without involving our&s;elves in the detail of the &s;everal memorials which were delivered in and without referring numerically to the &s;everal articles, it will be &s;ufficient that we briefly &s;tate tho&s;e points which were, or &s;eemed to be, in a fair way of adju&s;tment between England and France; and afterwards tho&s;e on which it &s;hould appear that the negotiation broke off.</P>
<P>After &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concerning its proper limits, it was
<PB N="408" REF="461">
agreed, that all Canada &s;hould be ceded to the Engli&s;h. This ce&s;&s;ion comprehended, on one &s;ide, all the i&s;lands and countries adjoining to the gulph of St. Lawrence. On the other, it took in all the great lakes, and the whole cour&s;e of the Ohio, to its di&s;charge into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. A territory &s;ufficient for the ba&s;is of a great empire.</P>
<P>In drawing this line of divi&s;ion, another que&s;tion aro&s;e concerning the bounds of Loui&s;iana, and the &s;tate of the intermediate Indian nation between the lakes and the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;ippi, who inhabit, or are rather &s;cattered over an immen&s;e country, that lies along the back of our colonies all the way from Pen&s;ylvania to Georgia. It was therefore very proper that &s;omething definitive &s;hould be &s;ettled on this article, as it might otherwi&s;e ea&s;ily be made productive of a new war, England propo&s;ed that all tho&s;e nations &s;hould con|tinue, as &s;he contended they had heretofore been, under the protection of Great Britain, without &s;aying any thing pre|ci&s;e as to the dominion of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>France controverted this propo&s;ition; &s;he on her part propo&s;ed to divide the&s;e nations; that tho&s;e to the north|ward of the line drawn to a&s;certain the limits of Canada &s;hould be independent, under the protection of England, but that tho&s;e, which were to the &s;outhward, &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame independence, under the protection of France. No|thing was perfectly &s;ettled in relation to this point; but it does not &s;eem as if there could have been any material di&s;|agreement upon it had the other matters in debate been ad|ju&s;ted to their mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The African conte&s;t &s;eemed to have been attended with &s;till le&s;s difficulty. The French con&s;ented to give up both Senegal and Goree, provided Anamaboo and Acra were guarantied to them.</P>
<P>The momentous que&s;tion of the fi&s;hery was likewi&s;e de|termined, The French gave up their claim to Cape Bre|ton and St. John's, and were &s;atisfied to receive the little i&s;land of St, Pierre on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland; but even this they were to receive on conditions &s;ufficiently humili|ating. They were to erect no &s;ort of fortification, nor to keep up any military e&s;tabli&s;hment there. An Engli&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ary was to re&s;ide on the i&s;land, in order to &s;ee that the&s;e &s;tipulations were adhered to. As to the re&s;t, the French were to have the &s;ame privileges on the coa&s;t of Newfound|land, checked with the &s;ame re&s;trictions, which before the
<PB N="409" REF="462">
war they had enjoyed under the 15th article of the treaty of Utrecht. In conformity to another article of that treaty, and in compen&s;ation for the privilege of the fi&s;hery, they con&s;ented that Dunkirk &s;hould be demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Concerning the i&s;lands of Guadaloupe, Marigalante, Mi|norca and Bellei&s;le, no great controver&s;y had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the beginning. It had all along been agreed, that, the&s;e conque&s;ts &s;hould be reciprocally re&s;tored. Neither did the French &s;cruple to adopt our propo&s;al concerning the affairs of the Ea&s;t-Indies, nor to make &s;atisfactory declara|tion concerning O&s;tend and Nieuport.</P>
<P>So many delicate and intere&s;ting points were &s;ettled, that it does not fir&s;t appear what it was that could have re|tarded the peace. A di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;eperate intere&s;ts of two powers only, that are in earne&s;t to agree, may be &s;et|tled without any very con&s;iderable difficulty. The hard and almo&s;t inextricable part of the knot, is that wherein the cro&s;s concerns and intere&s;ts of allies intervene. There were two points upon which, if we may form a judgment from appearances, this negotiation unfortunately broke off. The fir&s;t was upon the manner in which England and France might be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t their re&s;pective allies; and on the re&s;titution of We&s;el, Gueldres, and &s;uch other places as the French had conquered from his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t member of this principal point, the repeated propo&s;als of France for a neutrality in Germany had been uniformly and po&s;itively rejected by our admini&s;tration. They were con&s;idered as &s;o many attacks upon national integrity. This &s;cheme therefore, not being admitted they would or could come to no agreement, and &s;carcely to an intelligible explanation either of the mode or the quantity of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they &s;hould be at li|berty mutually to impart to their German allies, or of the place in which &s;uch &s;uccours &s;hould be employed. As to We&s;el and Gueldres, the French ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to re&s;tore tho&s;e places. They declared that &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ion would be directly again&s;t the faith by which they were bound to the empre&s;s queen of Hungary, for whom they in&s;i&s;ted that the&s;e places had been conquered, and in who&s;e name alone they were governed, though they had been reduced by the French arms, and were at that moment held by French garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, namely, the re&s;titution of cap|tures
<PB N="408" REF="463">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="409" REF="464">

<PB N="410" REF="465">
made previous to the declaration of war, the negoti|ating powers were equally po&s;itive, the one to demand, the other to refu&s;e it. The Engli&s;h argued that this claim had no &s;ort of foundation in the law of nations, neither was it grounded on any particular convention. That the right of all ho&s;tile operations re&s;ults, not from a formal declaration of war but from the ho&s;tilities which the aggre&s;&s;or has fir&s;t offered; that the contrary of this propo&s;ition is at lea&s;t ex|tremely conte&s;tible; and &s;ince, it can by no means be clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed, it follows that the detainment of tho&s;e captures mu&s;t be con&s;idered, on the &s;ide of England, as part of the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> originally propo&s;ed as the ba&s;is of this treaty.</P>
<P>France on the other hand, &s;eemed as fully convinced of the ju&s;tice of her preten&s;ions, and &s;he deemed the arguments with which &s;he &s;upported them to be &s;o unan&s;werable, that &s;he offered to &s;ubmit them to the ju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h tri|bunals. They urged that this claim of re&s;titution was founded on the law of nations, and upon particular conven|tion; by the 19th article of the peace of Utrecht; and by the &s;econd article of the treaty of commerce; and that this was &s;trengthened by the third article of the treaty of Aix|la-Chappelle, which renews and confirms tho&s;e articles in the preceeding treaties.</P>
<P>By the&s;e articles a protection is allowed to the re&s;pective &s;ubjects who may have &s;hips in the ports of either of the powers, becau&s;e having no opportunity of knowing that a rupture is fallen out, they &s;ailed under a &s;ecurity of peace, and under the faith of treaties. By a parity of rea&s;oning, the &s;hips not actually in tho&s;e ports ought to enjoy the &s;ame &s;ecurity; el&s;e, as they are included in the &s;ame parity of cir|cum&s;tances, it would follow, contrary to the principals of humanity and right rea&s;on, that the &s;overeigns had provided for the pre&s;ervation of one part of their &s;ubjects from the mi&s;eries of a &s;udden rupture, to which they expo&s;e the re&s;t. The particular conventions of the&s;e treaties, they &s;aid, had their foundation in general equity and the law of nations; &s;ince, as it is impracticable for belligerent &s;tates to agree among&s;t them&s;elves which is the agre&s;&s;or, it is proper that the &s;ubjects &s;hould receive previous notice of the rupture, in order that they may be able di&s;tinctly to know when they are, or are not in &s;ecurity, or when they may, or may not rely on the treaties which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between their &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>The&s;e topics were as u&s;ual, bandied to and fro with great
<PB N="411" REF="466">
heat and little effect; and as in &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions the arguments on both &s;ides are plau&s;ible, and there can be no authori&s;ed judge, the weight of the &s;everal preten&s;ions commonly de|pends upon the power of the parties to enforce them. On the&s;e two points, therefore, the renunciation of German alliances, and the re&s;titution of captures, the negotiation from the beginning was at a &s;tand; and on the&s;e at length to all appearance, it finally broke off.</P>
<P>Not but we are fully &s;atisfied that the di&s;agreement even on the&s;e points might have been only the o&s;ten&s;ible cau&s;e of the rupture. The true cau&s;e of the breach &s;eems to have been the un&s;ea&s;onable interpo&s;ition of the Spani&s;h claims. For could France be &s;uppo&s;ed in good earne&s;t to de&s;ire peace, that is, to de&s;ire &s;uch a rea&s;onable peace, as her circum&s;tances might demand, when &s;he officiou&s;ly min|gled with our particular debate, the affairs of a foreign and neutral power, which had not the &s;malle&s;t connection with tho&s;e that were at this time properly under delibera|tion? It was ridiculous to urge, that this was done from a prudent fore&s;ight, and to prevent a future war, which the&s;e di&s;putes might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion. The bu&s;ine&s;s was to put an end to the war which then actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and no|thing could be farther from a&s;&s;i&s;ting this de&s;ign than to in|crea&s;e the &s;ubjects of debate. France mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the weight of this argument, who her&s;elf propo&s;ed in the very beginning of this treaty, as means almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for carrying it on with effect, that their particular di&s;pute &s;hould be &s;eparated from tho&s;e of their German allies, with which it certainly had a more natural connexion than with tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between England and Spain; as all the former parties were then engaged directly or indirectly in the war, to which Spain had then no manner of relation.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try finding the French immoveable on the two capital points above mentioned and having no opi|nion of the &s;incerity of their procedure, &s;ent directions to Mr. Stanly, to return to England, and to de|&s;ire that Mr. Bu&s;&s;y &s;hould on the part of his court, receive the &s;ame orders.

 An end was thus put to this negotiation, (from which Europe had conceived &s;uch &s;anguine hopes of the alleviation of its mi&s;eries) after it had continued near &s;ix months.

engaged, or from extingui&s;hing the old war, that the parties &s;eperated with intention more ho&s;tile, and opi|nions more adver&s;e than ever; and the war was &s;oon &s;pread to a much greater extent by the taking in of a new party, and may po&s;&s;ibly &s;pread, &s;till more widely, by laying open new &s;ources of contention which may gradually draw in other powers, and finally involve every part of Europe. It was al&s;o a means of producing changes in England, which at a time of le&s;s tranquility, and in circum&s;tances of le&s;s internal &s;trength might have been productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS nothing could have been more unprecedented, &s;o no|thing was more alarming than the proceeding of the court of Spain in the negotiation. It was altogether extra|ordinary to &s;ee a propo&s;al for accommodating di&s;putes that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between friends coming thro' the channel of an enemy. It was extremely &s;ingular to &s;ee points of &s;uch con&s;equence formally communicated and propo&s;ed for de|liberation by a French agent, commi&s;&s;ioned only to nego|tiate a particular and di&s;tinct bu&s;ine&s;s, when the Spaniards had an amba&s;&s;ador re&s;iding in London, from whom no &s;ort of intimation had been previou&s;ly received of &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>That propo&s;al not only marked out a want of &s;incerity on the part of France, but it manife&s;ted &s;o &s;trange and ir|regular a partiality on the part of Spain, that it would very little have become the dignity of the king of Great Britain, or his attention to the &s;afety of his &s;ubjects, to let it pa&s;s without a full and &s;atisfactory explanation. Accordingly the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was called upon to di&s;avow this ir|regular procedure; but he returned a verbal, and &s;oon after was authori&s;ed by his court to return a written an&s;wer, in

which he openly avowed and ju&s;tified the &s;tep taken by the French agent, as entirely agreeable to the &s;entiments of his ma&s;ter. He declared that the kings of France and Spain were united not only by ties of blood, but by a mutual in|tere&s;t. He applauded the humanity and greatne&s;s of mind which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty demon&s;trated in the pro|po&s;ition that was complained of. He in&s;i&s;ted much on the &s;incere de&s;ire of peace, the only motive which influenced the conduct of the two monarchs; and he added, haughtily, that if his ma&s;ter had been governed by any other princi|ples,
<Q>His Catholic maje&s;ty giving full &s;cope to his great|ne&s;s, would have &s;poken from him&s;elf, and as became his dignity.</Q></P>
<P>It appeared evidently from the whole of this paper, that the court of Spain was regularly, as a fort of party, ap|pri&s;ed of every &s;tep that was taken in the negotiation; that her judgment was appealed to upon every point, and her authority called in aid to force the acceptance of the terms which were offered by France; in a word, that there was a perfect union of affections, intere&s;ts, and councils between the&s;e two courts; and the mini&s;ter of the former, &s;o far from denying or palliating this conduct, &s;eemed to glory in it.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt who then took the lead in the mini&s;try, was fully &s;atisfied the intentions of Spain were by no means equivocal, and that this partiality, which they &s;trong|ly avowed not only by declarations, but by facts, would drive them into all the mea&s;ures of France. That a war on that account was ab&s;olutely inevitable; and if, for the pre&s;ent moment, the Spaniards rather delayed their declaration of war, than laid a&s;ide their ho&s;tile inten|tions, it was in order to &s;trike the blow at their own time, and with the greater effect; that therefore their rea&s;ons for delaying to act were the very motives, which ought to in|duce us to act with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, and utmo&s;t vigour. That we ought to con&s;ider the eva&s;ions of that court as a refu&s;al of &s;atisfaction, and that refu&s;al, as a declaration of war. That we ought from prudence as well as from &s;pirit to &s;ecure our&s;elves the fir&s;t blow; and to be practically convinced, that the early and effective mea&s;ures, which had &s;o large a &s;hare in reducing France to this dependence upon Spain, would al&s;o be the fitte&s;t for deterring or di&s;abling Spain from affording any protection to France. That, to
<PB N="414" REF="469">
carry on this war with vigour, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to con|tinue our pre&s;ent efforts; no new armament would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and that if any war could provide its own re&s;ources, it mu&s;t be a war with Spain. That their flota had not yet arrived, and that the taking of it, would at once di&s;able theirs and &s;trengthen our hands. This procedure &s;o &s;uited to the dignity of the nation, and the in&s;ults it had received, would be a le&s;&s;on to Spain, and to every other power, how they &s;hould pre&s;ume to dictate in our affairs, and to intermeddle with a menacing mediation, and an officiou&s;ne&s;s as in&s;idious as it was audacious. That he would allow our enemies, whether &s;ecret or declared, no time to think and recollect them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, &s;o agreeable to the re&s;olute and en|terpri&s;ing character of this mini&s;ter, appeared &s;hocking to almo&s;t all the re&s;t of his collegues. They admitted that we ought not to be terrified from the a&s;&s;ertions of our ju&s;t de|mands, by the menaces of any power. They owned that Spain had taken a very extraordinary and very unju&s;tifiable &s;tep; but that we ought to admit and even to wi&s;h for, an explanation; this court upon a &s;ober yet &s;pirited remon|&s;trance, might recall that ra&s;h propo&s;ition into which they had been perhaps unwarily &s;educed by the artifices of France; that to &s;hun war upon a ju&s;t occa&s;ion was coward|ice, but to provoke or court it was madne&s;s. And, if to court a war was not in general a very wi&s;e mea&s;ure, to de|&s;ire it with Spain, if po&s;&s;ibly it could be avoided, was to overturn the mo&s;t fundamental principles of the policy of both nations. That this de&s;ire of adding war to war, and enemy to enemy, whil&s;t we had our hands already as full as they could hold, and whil&s;t all our faculties were &s;trained to the utmo&s;t pitch, was ill to calculate the national &s;trength of our country, which, however great, had its limits, and was not able to contend with all the world; that whil&s;t we were calling for new enemies, no motion was made of new allies, nor indeed of any new re&s;ource what&s;oever. To plunge into &s;uch mea&s;ures, in the manner propo&s;ed, and upon no better grounds, could not fail to &s;candalize and alarm all Europe; and we could po&s;&s;ibly derive no advantage from this precipitate conduct, which would not be more than counter-balanced by the jealou&s;y and terror it would nece&s;|&s;arily create in every nation near us. As to the &s;eizure of the flota, it was not to be reckoned upon, as at the very
<PB N="415" REF="470">
time of that deliberation it might be expected to be &s;afe in its harbour; and perhaps if we could &s;ucceed in &s;eizing it, we might perform a &s;ervice not very agreeable to neutral nations, and as little advantageous to our own commerce. If Spain, blind to her true intere&s;ts, and mi&s;led by French councils, &s;hould give in a more deci&s;ive manner into the de&s;igns of that court, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e a rea&s;onable &s;a|tisfaction, it would be then the true time to declare war, when all the neighbouring and impartial powers were con|vinced that we acted with as much temper as re&s;olution, and when every thinking man at home &s;hould be &s;atisfied that he was not hurried into the hazards and expences of war, from an idea of chimerical heroi&s;m, but from inevi|table nece&s;&s;ity; and that in &s;uch a ca&s;e we might depend upon the utmo&s;t &s;upport which the nation could give to an admini&s;tration that depended upon its &s;trength, and yet dreaded to wa&s;te it wantonly, or to employ it unju&s;tly. The mini&s;ter warmed by this oppo&s;ition, declared that,
<Q>This was the time for humbling the whole Hou&s;e of Bourbon; that if this opportunity was let &s;lip, it might never be recovered; and if he could not prevail in this in&s;tance, he was re&s;olved that this was the la&s;t time he would &s;it in that council. He thanked the mini&s;ters of the late king for their &s;upport; &s;aid he was him&s;elf called to the mini&s;try by the voice of the people, to whom he con&s;i|dered him&s;elf as accountable for his conduct; and that he would no longer remain in a &s;ituation which made him re&s;pon&s;ible for mea&s;ures he was no longer allowed to guide.</Q></P>
<P>The noble lord, who precided in this council, to whom years have added the wi&s;dom of experience, without abat|ing the vigour and fire of youth; and who was him&s;elf as bold a mini&s;ter as ever directed the affairs of this nation, made him this reply:
<Q>I find the gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I &s;ay I am &s;orry for it, &s;ince he would otherwi&s;e have certainly compelled us to leave him; but, if he be re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the right of ad|vi&s;ing his maje&s;ty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpo&s;es are we called to this council? When he talks of being re&s;pon&s;ible to the people, he talks the language of the hou&s;e of commons, and for|gets, that at this board, he is only re&s;pon&s;ible to the king. However, though he may po&s;&s;ibly have convinced
<PB N="416" REF="471">
him&s;elf of his infallibility, &s;till it remains that we &s;hould be equally convinced before we can re&s;ign our under&s;tand|ing to his direction, or join with him in the mea&s;ure be propo&s;es.</Q>

<P>On the divi&s;ion, the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, and a noble lord clo&s;ely connected with him, were the only voices in favour of the immediate declaration of war; the re&s;t of the board were unanimou&s;ly again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve that together with tho&s;e matters, which have been publi&s;hed, relative to this very important deliberation, with &s;ome appearance of authenticity, we have added &s;uch arguments as have been agitated among the people; a liberty nece&s;&s;ary to place the matter in its full light.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt and lord Temple, adhering to their fir&s;t opinion, and having delivered their rea&s;ons in writing, re&s;igned their employments. This re&s;ignation &s;eemed equal to a revolu|tion in the &s;tate. An univer&s;al alarm was &s;pread; a thou|&s;and rumours flew abroad, and the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions were, that this great mini&s;ter, endeavouring to avail him&s;elf by his firmne&s;s in negotiation of the advantages he had acquired
<PB N="417" REF="472">
by his vigour in war, was oppo&s;ed by the whole council, who were re&s;olved to have a peace at any rate, and that this oppo&s;ition had driven him to re&s;ign the &s;eals&punc; But the true cau&s;e of the re&s;ignation very &s;oon came out; and on this point a violent conflict en&s;ued, in which the popular cau&s;e was wor&s;e &s;u&s;tained, and the mini&s;terial better, (that is, with greater effect) than is u&s;ual in &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. Some circum&s;tances contributed not a little to this &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When Mr. Pitt re&s;igned the &s;eals, the great per&s;on to whom they were delivered received them with ea&s;e and firmne&s;s, without reque&s;ting that he &s;hould re&s;ume his of|fice. His maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the lo&s;s of &s;o able a &s;ervant; and to &s;hew the favourable &s;en&s;e he enter|tained of his &s;ervices, he made him a mo&s;t gracious and un|limited offer of any rewards in the power of the crown to be&s;tow. His maje&s;ty at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf not only &s;atisfied with the opinion of the majority of his council, but declared he would have found him&s;elf under the greate&s;t difficulty how to have acted, had that council concurred as fully in &s;upporting the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed by Mr. Pitt, as they had done in rejecting it. A &s;entiment (in the light in which his maje&s;ty con&s;idered this mea&s;ure) grounded upon the firme&s;t principles of integrity and ho|nour, and which mu&s;t rai&s;e the highe&s;t veneration for his royal character not only among his own &s;ubjects, but among&s;t all nations, when they &s;ee a power which has &s;o little to fear from any human effort, &s;o very fearful of the lea&s;t infringement of the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t critical rules of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was &s;en&s;ibly touched with the grandeur and conde&s;cen&s;ion of this proceeding. 'I confe&s;s, Sir, I had but too much rea&s;on to expect your maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure. I did not come prepared for this exceeding goodne&s;s. Par|don me, Sir,&mdash;it overpowers, it oppre&s;&s;es me.' He bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>We are far from an attempt to add any colouring to &s;o exqui&s;itely affecting a picture. We are indeed far from be|ing able to do ju&s;tice to perhaps one of the mo&s;t pathetic and elevated &s;cenes which could po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;played, the parting of &s;uch a prince, and &s;uch a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next day a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds a year was &s;ettled on Mr. Pitt for three lives, and at the &s;ame time a title was conferred upon his lady and her i&s;&s;ue; a pen&s;ion
<PB N="418" REF="473">
the be&s;t be&s;towed, and a nobility the mo&s;t honourably ac|quired, and mo&s;t truly merited. Immediately the Gazette gave notice to the public of all the&s;e tran&s;actions. The re|&s;ignation made the fir&s;t article; the honours and rewards the next; and they were followed by a letter from our am|ba&s;&s;ador in Spain, containing an account of the favourable and pacific language of that court, and of the &s;trong a&s;&s;u|rances they gave of a de&s;ire to accommodate all differences in an amicable manner.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that this manoeuvre was very &s;kilfully executed. For it at once gave the people to under&s;tand the true motive to the re&s;ignation; the in&s;ufficiency of that motive, and the graciou&s;ne&s;s of the king notwith&s;tanding the abrupt departure of his mini&s;ter. If after this the late mini&s;ter &s;hould chu&s;e to enter into oppo&s;ition, he mu&s;t go into it loaded and oppre&s;&s;ed with the imputation of the blacke&s;t ingratitude; if on the other hand he &s;hould retire from bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;hould concur in &s;upport of that admini&s;|tration which he had left, becau&s;e he di&s;approved its mea|&s;ures, his acquie&s;cence would be attributed by the multitude to a bargain for his for&s;aking the public, and that the title and the pen&s;ion were the con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the barriers that were oppo&s;ed again&s;t that torrent of popular rage, which it was apprehended would proceed from this re&s;ignation. And the truth is, they an|&s;wered their end perfectly: This torrent for &s;ome time was beaten back, almo&s;t diverted into an oppo&s;ite cour&s;e; and when afterwards it returned to tho&s;e objects, again&s;t which it was originally directed, and where it was mo&s;t dreaded, it was no longer that impetuous and irre&s;i&s;tible tide, which in the year 1757 had borne down every thing before it; it was weakened, divided, and ineffective.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion the clamours and inferior members of each party went lengths, which undoubtedly were neither authori&s;ed nor approved by their leaders. The friends of Mr. Pitt rai&s;ed the mo&s;t violent clamours for di&s;placing a mini&s;ter, who&s;e mea&s;ures had rai&s;ed the nation from the mo&s;t abject &s;tate, to the highe&s;t pinacle of glory. They &s;aid, that
<Q>he was in fact di&s;placed, when he was com|pelled to re&s;ign, by not being &s;uffered to carry into ex|ecution tho&s;e mea&s;ures which he knew to be nece&s;&s;ary to the honour and &s;afety of his country. That the check which this mini&s;ter had received, would mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;on|ably
<PB N="419" REF="474">
revive the drooping hopes of France, &s;unk by the vigour of our military operations, and the firmne&s;s of our councils under his admini&s;tration, and would &s;hew Spain with what impunity &s;he might in&s;ult the honour of the Briti&s;h crown, and violate the property of its &s;ub|jects. They reckoned up the di&s;graces which the nati|on had &s;uffered before Mr. Pitt had entered into the management of affairs, and the victories and conque&s;ts which were the fruit of his councils.</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e rea&s;onings, addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olutions and in&s;tructions were &s;et on foot in the great corporations; and it was believed that the example would be followed, as on a former occa&s;ion of the &s;ame kind, by all the other ci|ties and boroughs of the kingdom. But the progre&s;s of this mea&s;ure, though commenced with much alacrity, was &s;low and languid: a few only of the corporations entered into it, and &s;ome even of the&s;e few in a manner le&s;s warm than was expected. A &s;trenuous defence was made on the part of the remaining mini&s;try.</P>
<P><Q>Was it ever heard, &s;aid they, that a &s;overeign has been cen&s;ured for li&s;tening to the whole body of his council, in preference to the particular opinions of a &s;in|gle man? On the contrary, this uncontrouled &s;way of a &s;ingle mini&s;ter has been often thought dangerous, and was always odious in our free con&s;titution; and is the more ju&s;tly to be di&s;liked, as perhaps incon&s;i&s;tent with the true &s;pirit, either of ab&s;olute monarchy, or of limi|ted government. Let the merit of this mini&s;ter be what it will, &s;hall his ma&s;ter therefore be forced to receive him upon any terms? Mu&s;t his prince, to gratify his ambitious views, or if you plea&s;e, his virtuous intentions, di&s;mi&s;s his whole council, and annihilate his prerogative as a king, his rea&s;on and judgment as a man? Was it ever heard before, that a coun&s;ellor has profe&s;&s;ed with|out any re&s;erve or any ma&s;k, that becau&s;e he could not guide in government, he would not co-operate? This has unque&s;tionably been the true motive for the conduct of many mini&s;ters, but never was the avowed motive until this occa&s;ion. Mr. Pitt has had the free&s;t &s;cope for the exertion of his genius; he was, perhaps, the only Engli&s;h mini&s;ter that never met with the &s;lighte&s;t oppo|&s;ition; he has had the trea&s;ures and the forces of the na|tion at his mo&s;t ab&s;olute command; let him, in his turn,
<PB N="420" REF="475">
do that ju&s;tice that has been done to him; let him if the favours of the crown con&s;titute no obligation, be bound at lea&s;t by the rules of equity; and if he will not partake in the conduct of the pre&s;ent mo&s;t intricate and difficult bu&s;ine&s;s of admini&s;tration, let him not ren|der it &s;till more intricate and more difficult by his oppo|&s;ition; and let him not &s;tudy to find a ju&s;tification of his mea&s;ures, from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e whom he has left, when that ill &s;uce&s;s will be owing to his own devi|ces.</Q></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING, to my great &s;urprize, that the cau&s;e and manner of my re&s;igning the &s;eals, is gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented in the city, as well as that the mo&s;t gracious and &s;pontaneous marks of his ma|je&s;ty's approbation of my &s;ervices, which marks followed my re|&s;ignation, have been infamou&s;ly traduced as a bargain for my for|&s;aking the public, I am under a nece&s;&s;ity of declaring the truth of both the&s;e facts, in a manner which I am &s;ure no gentleman will contradict; a difference of opinion with regard to mea&s;ures to be taken again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> of the highe&s;t importance to the honour of the crown, and to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential national intere&s;ts, (and this founded on what <HI>Spain</HI> had already done, not on what that court may farther intend to do) was the cau&s;e of my re&s;igning the &s;eals&punc; Lord Temple and I &s;ubmitted in writing, and &s;igned by us, our mo&s;t humble &s;entiments to his maje&s;ty, which being over-ruled by the united opinion of all the re&s;t of the king's &s;ervants, I re&s;igned the &s;eals on Monday the 5th of this month, in order not to remain re&s;pon&s;ible for mea&s;ures, which I was no longer allowed to guide.

whole life, public and private, was &s;crutinized with the utmo&s;t malignity, to furni&s;h matter of calumny again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his admini&s;tration were depreciated; his faults were mon&s;trou&s;ly exaggerated, and the rewards and honours &s;o ju&s;tly conferred on him by his &s;overeign, were by every trick of wit, ridicule, and buffoonery, converted into matter of degradation and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Without pre&s;uming to take any part in a controver&s;y, which (however unequally) divided the royal council, or without entering into the &s;entiments of any faction, which we have always &s;hunned, we may affirm with truth and impartiality, that no man was ever better fitted than Mr. Pitt, to be the mini&s;ter in a great and powerful nation, or better qualified to carry that power and greatne&s;s to their utmo&s;t limits. There was in all his de&s;igns a magnitude, and even a va&s;tne&s;s, which was not ea&s;ily comprehended by every mind, and which nothing but &s;ucce&s;s could have made to appear rea&s;onable. If he was &s;ometimes incor|rect he was never vulgar.</P>
<P>His power, as it was not acquired, &s;o neither was ex|erci&s;ed in an ordinary manner. With very little parliamen|tary, and with le&s;s court influence, he &s;wayed both at court and in parliament with an authority unknown before, to the be&s;t &s;upported mini&s;ters. He was called to the mini&s;|try by the voice of the people; and what is more rare, he held it with that approbation; and under him for the fir&s;t time, admini&s;tration and popularity were &s;een united. Un|der him Great Britain carried on the mo&s;t important war in which &s;he ever was engaged, alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, with greater &s;plendour, and with more &s;ucce&s;s than &s;he had ever enjoyed at the head of the mo&s;t powerful alliances. Alone this i&s;land &s;eemed to ballance the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>In the conduct of the war he never &s;uffered the enemy to
<PB N="422" REF="478">
breathe, but overwhelmed them with re-iterated blows, and kept up the alarm in every quarter. If one of his expedi|tions was not &s;o well calculated or &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully executed, amends were made by another, and by a third. The &s;pi|rit of the nation once rou&s;ed, was not &s;uffered for a mo|ment to &s;ub&s;ide; and the French, dazzled, as it were, by the multitude and celerity of his enterprizes, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all power of re&s;i&s;tance. In &s;hort, he revived the military genius of our people; he &s;upported our allies; he extended our trade; he rai&s;ed our reputation; he augment|ed our dominions; and on his departure from admini&s;trati|on, left the nation in no other danger than that which ever mu&s;t attend exorbitant power, and the temptation which may be, to the invidious exertion of it. Happy it had been for him, for his &s;overeign, and his country, if a temper le&s;s au&s;tere, and a di&s;po&s;ition more practicable, more com|pliant, and conciliating, had been joined to his other great virtues. The want of the&s;e qualities di&s;abled him from act|ing any otherwi&s;e than alone: it prevented our enjoying the joint fruit of the wi&s;dom of many able men, who might mutually have tempered, and mutually forwarded each other; and finally, which was not the meane&s;t lo&s;s, it de|prived us of his own immediate &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who cen&s;ured his political conduct the mo&s;t &s;e|verely, could rai&s;e but few exceptions to it; none of them &s;ingly and perhaps, the whole united, of no great weight again&s;t a per&s;on long engaged in &s;o great a &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>Whether the part, which under his admini&s;tration we rather continued to act than newly took, with regard to the affairs of Germany, be for the real intere&s;t of Great Bri|tain, is a que&s;tion of the utmo&s;t difficulty, and which per|haps will never admit a &s;atisfactory &s;olution. To condemn him on this head we mu&s;t be &s;ure of this &s;olution. It has been ob&s;erved in favour of that conte&s;ted mea&s;ure, that France demon&s;trated, through the whole progre&s;s of the late treaty, the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, that we &s;hould abandon the German connection; no trifling argument, that our enemy did not look upon it to be extremely prejudicial to our intere&s;ts. If he has carried on that war at a va&s;t expence, a prodigious &s;tand has been made again&s;t the intire power of France; had le&s;s been expended, the whole expence might have been lo&s;t. How far this part of his conduct was agreeable to his former declarations, is a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which
<PB N="423" REF="479">
can avail but little. He found the nation engaged in the&s;e affairs; it was more ea&s;y to pu&s;h them forward, than to extricate him&s;elf from them; as he proceeded, he di&s;co|vered by experience the advantages of that plan of action, and his opinion was changed.</P>
<P>But even admitting, that, to attain the ends of oppo&s;iti|on, he had once fallen upon popular topics, which even then he knew were not tenable, it can form but a very &s;mall blemi&s;h in a public character, however wrong it may be by application to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of morality. Ill would it fare with &s;tate&s;men if this &s;ort of con&s;i&s;tency were to be expect|ed from the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent of them.</P>
<P>With regard to the pen&s;ion and title, it is a &s;hame that any defence &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. What eye cannot di&s;tin|gui&s;h, at the fir&s;t glance, the difference between this and the exceptionable ca&s;e of titles and pen&s;ions? What Briton, with the &s;malle&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour and gratitude, but mu&s;t blu&s;h for his country, if &s;uch a man retired unrewarded from the public &s;ervice, let the motives to that retirement be what they would? It was not po&s;&s;ible that his &s;overeign could let his eminent &s;ervices pa&s;s unrequited; the &s;um that was given was undoubtedly inadequate to his merits; and the quantum was rather regulated by the moderation of the great mind that received it, than by the liberality of that which be&s;towed it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Di&s;pute with Spain. Repre&s;entation of the earl of Bri&s;tol. Di&s;po&s;ition of the court of Madrid. Treaty between France and Spain. England de&s;ires a communication. Court of Spain refu&s;es. The mini&s;ters mutually withdraw. A rupture.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE unfortunate intervention of Spain in the late ne|gotiation, rai&s;ed &s;o many difficulties, and created &s;o&punc;
<PB N="424" REF="480">
much mi&s;chief both abroad and at home, that it becomes an aera in this hi&s;tory, and it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould pur&s;ue that object from the point at which we left it, to its final and fatal determination.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which had been received from the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter in London was far from being &s;atisfactory to our court. Orders were immediately given to the earl of Bri&s;|tol, our amba&s;&s;ador in Spain, to remon&s;trate with energy and firmne&s;s on &s;o extraordinary a proceeding; to adhere to the negative put upon the Spani&s;h preten&s;ions to fi&s;h at Newfoundland; to re&s;t the article of di&s;puted captures, on the ju&s;tice of our tribunals; to continue the former profe&s;|&s;ions of our de&s;ire of an amicable adju&s;tment of the log|wood di&s;pute; and of our willingne&s;s to cau&s;e the &s;ettle|ments on the coa&s;t of Honduras to be evacuated, as &s;oon as ever his Catholick maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t a method for our enjoyment of that traffic to which we had a right by treaty, and which was further confirmed to us by repeated promi&s;es from that court.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that the earl of Bri&s;tol was authori&s;ed to proceed with that &s;pirit, which the offended dignity of our court required, and to bring Spain to a categorical and &s;atisfactory declaration, concerning her final intentions; yet if he perceived on her part any intention to di&s;avow or even to explain away this offen&s;ive tran&s;action, he was rea|dily to accept it, and to afford to that court as hand&s;ome a retreat as po&s;&s;ible. The letter which conveyed the&s;e in|&s;tructions was written by Mr. Pitt, and dated on the 28th of July, a few days after the fatal memorial had been deliver|ed by Mr. Bu&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>The earl of Bri&s;tol punctually obeyed tho&s;e orders. He found General Wall, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, much in cold blood, and in very equivocal di&s;po&s;itions. He heard with great patience the proper and energetic repre&s;entation that had been very ably made by the earl of Bri&s;tol. He ap|plauded the king of Great Britain's magnanimity in not &s;uffering France as a tribunal, to be appealed to in his di&s;|putes with Spain; and declared, that in the propo&s;ition which had been made with the con&s;ent of his court, things were not con&s;idered in that light; a&s;ked whether it could be imagined in England, that the Catholic king was &s;eek|ing to provoke us in our pre&s;ent mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and mo&s;t exalted &s;ituation, and after &s;uch a &s;eries of pro&s;perous events
<PB N="425" REF="481">
as no &s;ingle nation had ever met with? He valued, and reciprocally returned, our frequent profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and our de&s;ire of amicable adju&s;tment. But the&s;e favoura|ble demon&s;trations were accompanied with &s;ome circum|&s;tances, that had a very menacing appearance. For in the fir&s;t place, he declared that at that time the utmo&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the courts of France and Spain; that in con&s;equence of their perfect agreement, there was a mutual unre&s;erved communication of every &s;tep taken in their &s;everal negotiations with England; that France had even offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t Spain, in ca&s;e the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions &s;he had with us &s;hould grow into a rupture; and that this offer was con&s;idered in a friendly light. Such an intimate union of a third power with one of the parties at war, forebodes no long duration to its friend&s;hip, or even to its neutrality with the other. If Spain ju&s;tified the proceedings of France, and owned her&s;elf concerned in them, it was but one, and that a &s;hort, &s;tep, to a junction with her.</P>
<P>As to the three matters in di&s;pute, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter re&s;olutely adhered to them all; and as to the la&s;t (that of the logwood) he ob&s;erved, that Great Britain had offered them nothing, but what they had long &s;ince been tired of, treaty and negotiation; that this matter had been already fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and that on this head Spain had given the mo&s;t convincing proofs of her de&s;ire to be on the be&s;t terms with England; for in the beginning of this war, before England had grown terrible by her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, when their American governors had endeavoured to di&s;lodge the En|gli&s;h from &s;ome new e&s;tabli&s;hments on the coa&s;t of Hondu|ras, they had, at the complaint of our court, in order to take away all cau&s;e of mi&s;tru&s;t, ordered the governor to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o ju&s;tifiable an enterprize. That on the offer of England on this occa&s;ion to &s;ettle matters in an amicable manner, they chearfully agreed to that method. But that &s;ix years had elap&s;ed without their receiving the lea&s;t &s;atis|faction. They even alleged that the Engli&s;h encroach|ments on their coa&s;ts in that time increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this manner the Spaniards vindicated the form and the matter of their proceeding: they &s;hewed no &s;ort of di&s;po&s;i|tion to relax from their claims; but at the &s;ame time they no longer in&s;i&s;ted on blending together the &s;everal di&s;cu&s;&s;i|ons; and they profe&s;&s;ed in general, though not very warm terms, a de&s;ire of continuing in amity with us. With re|gard
<PB N="426" REF="482">
to the matter in di&s;pute, the preten&s;ions of both pow|ers &s;tood in this po&s;ture throughout the whole di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; except that they were urged with more or le&s;s a&s;perity, ac|cording to the fluctuating di&s;po&s;ition of the court of Spain, which &s;eemed to re&s;t upon no &s;ure and &s;ettled principals. There were probably two factions in her councils who as they alternately prevailed, changed the language and counte|nance of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter. However, for &s;ome time the a&s;pect of things continued on the whole to be rather fa|vourable; and even an expre&s;s declaration was at length made, that Spain had been, at no time, more intent on cultivating a good corre&s;pondence with us. But &s;till the French intere&s;t &s;ilently gained ground at Madrid; the con|fidental communications of that court with Spain; her af|fected moderation in the treaty; the dangerous greatne&s;s of England; the common intere&s;t of the hou&s;e of Buorbon, every part of which mu&s;t &s;uffer, both in its dignity and &s;afe|ty, by allowing the principal of its branches to be pruned to the quick: the&s;e points were urged with continual &s;olli|citation; and they a&s;&s;ured the Spaniards that even the &s;ign|ing an alliance between the &s;overeigns of the two nations, would intimidate England, already exhau&s;ted by the war, and apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing the valuable commerce &s;he car|ried on with Spain.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments and &s;ugge&s;tions at length prevailed, and a treaty was &s;igned between the two courts, the pur|po&s;e of which was to pre&s;erve from oppre&s;&s;ion, and to maintain the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. This al|liance was of a nature the more dangerous, as it turned up|on family not national intere&s;t, and becau&s;e not &s;tating ex|actly its objects, it might be made ju&s;t of what extent they plea&s;ed. We make no mention of any other treaty than this, of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently alarming, becau&s;e whatever &s;u&s;|picions may be entertained,, there is no certainty that any other has been concluded between tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>France had obtained in this treaty almo&s;t all that &s;he aimed at; by it &s;he entered into the clo&s;e&s;t connection with Spain; this connection did not indeed &s;eem directly of ne|ce&s;&s;ity to conclude a breach with England; it led to it how|ever, almo&s;t inevitably. At fir&s;t the whole tran&s;action was kept a profound &s;ecret; the inferiority of the marine of Spain, and the precariou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;upplies from America, in ca&s;e they came to a pre&s;ent rupture with England, obliged
<PB N="427" REF="483">
them to this temporary re&s;erve. France took care that this treaty &s;hould not tran&s;pire untill the negotiation was broken off; and Spain, whil&s;t &s;he was under the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, exhibited tho&s;e occa&s;ional proofs of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, which we have ju&s;t now &s;een. But as &s;oon as France had lo&s;t all hopes of concluding the negotiation in the manner &s;he had wi&s;hed, and had failed in the u&s;e &s;he made of the intervention of the claims of Spain, &s;he circulated with great indu&s;try a report, that Spain would immediately de|clare again&s;t Great Britain, in con&s;equence of a treaty lately concluded among the Bourbon courts.</P>
<P>England found that tho&s;e boa&s;ts of the French were too confidently made, and too generally believed, to be altoge|ther without foundation. In con&s;equence of the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions, orders were &s;ent to Spain, to demand in the mo&s;t moderate terms, but in a manner not to be evaded, a com|munication of this treaty, or at lea&s;t a di&s;avowal that it con|tained any thing to the prejudice of Great Britain. But before the&s;e orders could reach Spain, lord Bri&s;tol had him|&s;elf received intelligence of the treaty, and of the hopes, which the French made no &s;ecret of their deriving from that &s;ource. He therefore thought him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring &s;atisfaction from the Spani&s;h &s;ecretary of &s;tate concerning it.</P>
<P>Upon this application there appeared on a &s;udden &s;uch a change in the countenance, language, and &s;entiments of that mini&s;ter, as indicated but too fully the ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;u&s;picions that were entertained. The Spani&s;h flota was now &s;afely arrived with a very rich cargo; the French arms had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the king's electoral do|minions; the &s;ucce&s;s of the Imperial arms was no le&s;s &s;trik|ing; the rea&s;ons for their former &s;hew of moderation no longer exi&s;ted. They therefore gave a loo&s;e to tho&s;e move|ments which they had hitherto concealed. M. Wall, evad|ing a direct an&s;wer, entered into a long and bitter com|plaint, not only of the treatment which Spain had received from us, but of the haughtine&s;s of our late proceedings with France; that it was time for them to open their eyes, and not to &s;uffer a neighbour, an ally, a relation, and a friend, any longer to run the ri&s;que of receiving &s;uch rigid laws as were pre&s;cribed by an in&s;ulting conqueror; that we were intoxicated with our &s;ucce&s;&s;es; and a continued &s;eries of victories had elated us &s;o far, as to make us reject the rea|&s;onable
<PB N="428" REF="484">
conce&s;&s;ion offered by France. This refu&s;al made it evident that our de&s;ign in ruining the French power, was the more ea&s;ily to cru&s;h Spain; that we propo&s;ed entirely to cha&s;e the French from all their colonies in America to have the ea&s;ier ta&s;k in &s;eizing on the Spani&s;h dominions in tho&s;e parts, thereby to &s;atisfy to the utmo&s;t of our ambition, and to gratify our boundle&s;s thir&s;t of conque&s;t; therefore he would him&s;elf be the man to advi&s;e the king of Spain, that &s;ince his dominions were to be overwhelmed, at lea&s;t that they &s;hould be &s;iezed with arms in his &s;ubjects hands, and not to continue the pa&s;&s;ive victim he had hitherto ap|peared in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, though a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o extraor|dinary a change of &s;tile, replied with coolne&s;s to the invec|tives, and with firmne&s;s to the menaces of the Spani&s;h mi|ni&s;ter; he obviated the objections which had been made, and &s;upported our preten&s;ions; after an&s;wering in the be&s;t manner to what M. Wall had urged, he returned to his fir&s;t demand, an explanation concerning the treaty: as often as a direct an&s;wer was evaded, the &s;ame que&s;tion was again put; and at length the only reply was, that the king of Spain had thought proper to <HI>renew his family compact;</HI> and then Mr. Wall, as if he was gone farther than he was au|thori&s;ed, &s;uddenly turned the di&s;cour&s;e, and no farther &s;ati&s;|faction could be obtained,</P>
<P>This revolution in the appearances of things in Spain, was too intere&s;ting not to be immediately communicated. Our mini&s;try &s;aw evidently, that the moderation they had hitherto di&s;played, might be attributed to fear, and that the language of the court of Spain would permit no doubt of their ho&s;tile inten&s;ions. Orders were therefore given to the earl of Bri&s;tol, conformable to dignity of the nation, and the ju&s;tice of our claim. He was ordered to renew his in&s;tances concerning the treaty; to demand an explanation with a proper firmne&s;s, but without the mixture of any thing which might irritate; and to &s;ignify, that a peremp|tory refu&s;al to communicate the treaty, or to di&s;avow an intention to take part with our enemies, would be con&s;i|dered as an aggre&s;&s;ion on the part of Spain, and an ab&s;o|lute declaration of war.</P>
<P>Things were now brought to a &s;ingle and preci&s;e point. The demand was made in the terms of the order. Then it was that the pride of Spain entirely threw of the remain|der
<PB N="429" REF="485">
of that ma&s;k, which her policy had per&s;uaded her to a&s;&s;ume; the &s;ecretary, M. Wall, replied,
<Q>That the &s;pirit of haughtine&s;s and of di&s;cord,

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 10."> 

 which dictated this incon&s;iderable &s;tep, and which for the misfortune of mankind &s;till reigns &s;o much in the Briti&s;h government, is what has made the declaration of war, and attacked the king's dignity; and that the Earl of Bri&s;tol might return when and in what manner was convenient to him.</Q></P>
<P>The Earl of Bri&s;tol parted from Madrid the 17th of De|cember; and thus was brought on a rupture which has prodigiou&s;ly extended the operations, and con&s;equently the mi&s;eries of war, and threatens to protect them to a very long duration. Europe unfortunately found her&s;elf plunged into the gulph of a new war, at the time &s;he hoped to emerge from the old one, and by the very means which were u&s;ed to draw her out of it. A point of honour alone &s;eemed to have been the la&s;t and immediate cau&s;e of the breach; but whoever has diligently attended to the Spani&s;h affairs from the memorial pre&s;ented by Bu&s;&s;y to the final an&s;wer delivered by Wall, will &s;ee that the motives were, however ill under&s;tood, of a much more &s;erious and impor|tant nature.</P>
<P>As the two powers had now come to extremities, and the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador had departed from Madrid, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter al&s;o quitted London; but before his departure he left a paper, in the nature of a manife&s;to, of very little im|portance in point of argument, but filled with invectives, charging the war on the haughtine&s;s of the late Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, and on the little re&s;pect with which his court had been treated, both during the admini&s;tration of that mini&s;ter, and &s;ince his re&s;ignation. That had the purport of the treaty been de&s;ired in a manner le&s;s offen&s;ive to the dignity of his ma&s;ter, it might as ea&s;ily have been obtained, as it could have been ju&s;tified; for the treaty, which was believ|ed to have been &s;igned on the 15th of Augu&s;t, contained only a reciprocal guaranty of the dominions of the &s;everal branches of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, but with this particular re&s;triction, that it &s;hould only extend to the dominions which &s;hall remain to France after the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked that, this paper, whil&s;t it pretends to &s;et forth the purport of a treaty dated the 15th of Augu&s;t, does not deny the exi&s;tence of any other treaty, which
<PB N="430" REF="486">
might more offen&s;ively concern the intere&s;t of Great Britain. It was however an&s;wered in every article with the utmo&s;t moderation, per&s;picuity and force, in a memorial of loth Egremont.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the defeat of the French near Wandewa&s;h, the taking of the city of Arcot, and the reduction of the fortre&s;&s;es of Chitteput and Carrical, Pondicherry wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the only &s;pace of con&s;equence which remained to our ene|mies in India. This town, beautifully built, &s;trongly forti|fied, and four leagues in circuit, &s;eemed rather the capital of a kingdom, than a trading e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of Malabar, about forty miles from our &s;ettle|ment at Madra&s;s, which in the days of its pro&s;perity it ri+valled, if not exceeded in trade, opulence and &s;plendor; and it &s;till remained the depo&s;itory of whatever wealth was left to the French, after the rever&s;e of their fortune in war.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fortre&s;&s;es adjacent to this important place had been reduced, and the inland country brought perfectly to our intere&s;ts by the total expul&s;ion of the French, the blockade of Pondicherry was commenced by the land forces under colonel Coote, and the marine under admiral Stevens. A regular &s;iege was at that time impracticable on account of the periodical rains, which were daily expected; and even under more favourable circum&s;tances it would have proved a ta&s;k of infinite difficulty to attempt any army that could be &s;upported in India, the taking of a place &s;o &s;trongly fortified, defended by a good garri&s;on, and by an officer able and re&s;olute, and who&s;e pride and ob&s;tinacy, &s;o prejudicial on all other occa&s;ions, would have made him, as in effect they did make him, per&s;evere to the very la&s;t moment, is
<PB N="431" REF="487">
the defence of the la&s;t &s;take, which the French had left in India.</P>
<P>The blockade being therefore cho&s;en as the mo&s;t eligible for the time, was continued with the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t extraordinary patience on both &s;ides, for full &s;even months. In this time the garri&s;on and inhabitants &s;uffered &s;orely by famine. Col. Coote, in order to augment their di&s;tre&s;s, erected batteries at a di&s;tance, not with a view of ruining the walls, but to harra&s;s the enemy by an encrea&s;e of garri&s;on duty.</P>
<P>At length when the weather appeared &s;ettled, four batte|ries were rai&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance to enfilade the &s;treets of Pondicherry, whil&s;t others were advanced nearer in order to play upon the works. The&s;e operations, though the &s;iege was not yet formally undertaken, commenced on the 26th of November, 1760, but as the &s;ea&s;on of the rains and winds was not yet quite over, much was &s;uffered from &s;torms, which ruined the batteries and approaches. They were however always repaired with the utmo&s;t alacrity and &s;peed, and the &s;iege &s;uffered no intermi&s;&s;ion. So that the be&s;ieged, who eagerly expected the arrival of their fleet to their relief, were reduced to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s. They lived on camels, elephants, dogs, and cats. The extreme &s;carcity and dearne&s;s even of this wretched provi&s;ion, increa&s;ed their mi&s;ery. Sixteen roupies (half crowns) had been paid for the fle&s;h of a dog.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s their hopes were &s;uddenly re|vived, and tho&s;e of the be&s;iegers, notwith&s;tanding the pro|gre&s;s they had made, almo&s;t totally depre&s;&s;ed. On the fir&s;t of January 1761, one of tho&s;e terrible &s;torms, &s;o frequent in the Indian &s;ea, and &s;o ruinous, drove the Engli&s;h &s;quadron from before Pondicherry. Two &s;hips of the line were wrecked, and their crews, with the exception of two or three men, entirely peri&s;hed. Two others of the &s;ame cla&s;s were driven a&s;hore, and beat to pieces. The men fortu|nately e&s;caped. The real damage which our fleet &s;u&s;tained on this occa&s;ion, together with the idea of a far greater, &s;ugge&s;ted by their own de&s;ires, and ju&s;tified by the violence of the &s;torm, elevated to the highe&s;t pitch the &s;pirits of the garri&s;on, &s;unk by di&s;ea&s;e, famine, fatigue, and an uninter|rupted train of adver&s;e fortune.

, as it may tend to furni&s;h &s;ome idea of the cha|racter of this &s;ingular man.</P>
<P>But admiral Stevens, and tho&s;e who commanded under him, exerting them&s;elves with unparalleled diligence and ce|lerity, appeared again before Pondicherry in le&s;s than four days after the &s;torm, with eleven &s;hips of the line and one frigate, and the blockade was as compleat as ever. No &s;uc|cours had been thrown in, and admiral Stevens in order to prevent the ill impre&s;&s;ion which the late di&s;a&s;ter might have occa&s;ioned, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the neighbouring Dutch and Dani&s;h &s;ettlements, of the good condition and &s;trength of the remainder of his fleet, and a&s;&s;ured them he would make prize of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as he found infringing the neutrality by attempting to &s;upply the enemy.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this mortifying di&s;appointment, M. Lally made no propo&s;al to &s;urrender. The &s;iege was carried on with redoubled alacrity; and at length a large battery being advanced within four hundred and fifty yards of the rampart, a breach being effected, and not more than one

day's provi&s;ion of any kind remaining, a &s;ignal was made for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms; the principal of the Je&s;uits, together with two Civilians came out, and offered terms of capi|tulation. The governor pre&s;erving all his haughtine&s;s, which neither his errors nor misfortunes could in the lea&s;t abate, declined to offer any terms;

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 15."> 

 he &s;ent out a paper full of invectives again&s;t the En|gli&s;h, for the breach of treaties relative to India; he alledged that tho&s;e breaches di&s;qualified him from propo&s;ing any terms; and in con&s;equence he rather &s;uffered our troops to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, than formally &s;urrender it. As the governor refu&s;ed to capitulate, the propo&s;al of the in|habitants was little regarded, and the city of Pondicherry, with a garri&s;on of about fourteen hundred European &s;ol|diers, a va&s;t quantity of military &s;tores, and great riches, was given up at di&s;cretion to our victorious arms.</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;aid too highly of the conduct, per&s;eve|rance, and unanimity of the land and &s;ea &s;ervices during a tedious &s;iege and blockade of eight months, in a climate &s;o unfavourable to all military operations. Colonel Coote gave the final blow to the French power in India; he was now indi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the rich coa&s;t of Coromandel; the French power was wholly extirpated; the neutral nations were contemptible; the princes of the country con&s;idered us with an aweful regard, and nothing but a little French &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t of Malabar, called Mahie, (and which was &s;oon after reduced) oppo&s;ed our commanding the whole trade of that va&s;t penin&s;ula of India from the Ganges to the Indies, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and profitable &s;phere of commerce in the world.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t every thing was giving way to our arms in the &s;outhern parts of this penin&s;ula, the affairs of France, which in Bengal had been to all appearance totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, ro&s;e up again for a moment from a quarter, and in a manner, which was little expected. After the taking of Chandena|gore by admiral Wat&s;on in the year 1757, Mr. Law, (ne|phew to that Law who had made him&s;elf &s;o well known by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;cheme) put him&s;elf at the head of a party of French fugitives, which was augmented from time to time to about two hundred men. With this &s;mall party he threw him&s;elf into the heart of the country, and joining him&s;elf &s;ometimes to one, &s;ometimes to another of the na|tive princes, as his intere&s;t led him; he rendered him&s;elf
<PB N="434" REF="490">
con&s;iderable by &s;everal &s;triking &s;ervices, and &s;upported the credit of his little corps with a very high reputation.</P>
<P>The Great Mogul having &s;ome time &s;ince been depo&s;ed by an irruption of the Marrattas, and dying &s;oon after, one of his &s;ons, Sha Zaddah, a&s;&s;umed the title, and was &s;up|ported by &s;ome of the provinces of that exten&s;ive and di&s;|united empire; he was oppo&s;ed by others; and though he was at the head of a royal army of his native &s;ubjects, &s;uch is the &s;tate of the military in that part of the world, that he con&s;idered an handful of European fugitives, as an acqui&s;ition of the greate&s;t importance, and &s;uch as might turn the ballance again&s;t any weight of Indians, which might be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. In fact, it was to Mr. Law he attributed the reduction of &s;everal con&s;iderable provinces to his obedience.</P>
<P>Elated with the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, Law per&s;uaded him to turn his arms again&s;t Bengal, which had not acknowledged him; it was a rich and flouri&s;hing country, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, would undoubtedly contribute more than all the re&s;t to &s;et him on the throne of the Moguls. Here, unfortunately for him the evil genius of Law impelled him to encounter again with tho&s;e arms, by which the intere&s;t of his country had been before ruined in this part of the world, and which indeed were tho&s;e only, from which he had a great deal to fear. Sha Zaddah entered the kingdom of Bengal at the head of an army of 80,000 Indians and &s;omething more than 200 French.</P>
<P>The French &s;upport was more prejudicial to his title in the eyes of the Engli&s;h, than any other objection, and as they were now become the arbiters of crowns in the Ea&s;t, they joined the Nabob of Bengal to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. About 20,000 blacks &s;upported by 500 Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, formed the army again&s;t him. A major (major Carnac) commanded that body, which engaged, and totally routed an army of four&s;core thou&s;and men, commanded by the Mogul in per&s;on. That prince was taken pri&s;oner; Mr. Law was al&s;o taken, and the party of French adventurers di&s;per&s;ed for ever. It is not yet known with certainty, in what manner they mean to di&s;po&s;e of their captive monarch. It was &s;ome heightening to the &s;atisfaction of this great event, that it happened on the &s;ame day in which the French agreed to the &s;urrender of Pondicherry.</P>
<P>A little before this, Jaffier Ali Cawn, the Nabob who,
<PB N="435" REF="491">
in 1757, had been placed in that dignity by general Clive, notwith&s;tanding the terrifying example of his predece&s;&s;or, by his weakne&s;s and mi&s;government, drew on him&s;elf the hatred of his &s;ubjects, and lo&s;t the protection of the Engli&s;h. But as his ambition was the feeble&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ions, he con|&s;ented quietly to quit the throne. The revolution was ef|fected without blood&s;hed, his &s;on-in-law was appointed in his room; and as the whole tran&s;action was with the con|&s;ent and co-operation of the Engli&s;h governor Van&s;ittart, the old privileges of the company were confirmed, and new were acquired: the Engli&s;h in Bengal were become nece&s;&s;ary to the government of that country, and every change pro|duced &s;omething to their advantage.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the period of this war in the Ea&s;t In|dies, has been marked by as many &s;triking events, uncom|mon circum&s;tances, and &s;ingular rever&s;es of fortune, as any that have happened from the time of our knowledge of this part of the world.</P>
<P>It can hardly be &s;aid, that this &s;eries of pro&s;perity was interrupted by the &s;ucce&s;sful attempts of the count d'E&s;taign. This lively adventurer, with the command of no more than two ordinary frigates, had in October 1759, taken and de|&s;troyed the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement of Bender-Aba&s;&s;i, on the Per|&s;ian gulph; he then &s;truck over to the i&s;land of Sumatra, where we carry on our mo&s;t con&s;iderable commerce in pep|per; and before the end of the following April, reduced Bencoolen, the principal &s;ettlement, and all the re&s;t of our forts and factories on that i&s;land, which made a defence al|together as unworthy of the re&s;t of our conduct in India, as that of the count d'E&s;taign was &s;uperior to the efforts of his countrymen in that quarter. This bold adventurer, how|ever, could not derive &s;o much honour from the vigour of his enterprize, as di&s;grace from having made them again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;acred law of arms: if what is &s;aid is true, that he was at the very time a pri&s;oner upon parole.</P>
<P>In America the i&s;land of Dominica, one of tho&s;e i&s;lands called Neutral, but which the French had fortified and &s;et|tled, was reduced by a &s;mall armament under lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas. North America was perfectly quieted by a peace with the Cherokees. Colonel Grant reduced them to this nece&s;&s;ity, by penetrating with great courage and per&s;everance into their country, and de&s;troying fifteen of their towns, and almo&s;t their whole harve&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE clo&s;e of the year 1761 left the affairs of all Eu|rope, both military and political, in the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting &s;ituation, in which they have &s;tood, at perhaps any period of our modern hi&s;tory. The endea|vours which had been made to bring about peace among&s;t the belligerent powers, &s;erved only to increa&s;e their ani|mo&s;ity.
<PB N="437" REF="493">
And at the &s;ame time they brought into light and exertion, tho&s;e latent motives and di&s;po&s;itions to war, which had long lurked in other powers under the veil of neutrali|ty; and had only been kept down &s;ometimes by irre&s;oluti|on of temper in per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes by want of &s;y&s;tem in politics. The&s;e ineffectual endeavours for peace produ|ced al&s;o many occa&s;ions of quarrel and debate, that were ab&s;olutely new.</P>
<P>To the north there was no appearance of relenting in any one of the powers engaged. It was not to be expected, that the confederacy, which had held together &s;o long, and under &s;uch difficulties and di&s;appointments, &s;hould now break to pieces, ju&s;t at the moment when the &s;tates which compo&s;ed it &s;eemed in a condition to reap the mature fruits of their unanimity and per&s;everance. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was not in a &s;tate either to allure or to intimidate. Great Britain could not increa&s;e his &s;ub&s;idy, nor reinforce his ar|mies. The allied army in We&s;tphalia played a defen&s;ive, and, on the whole of the campaign, a lo&s;ing game; and there was nobody &s;o &s;anguine as to think that Great Bri|tain could increa&s;e her &s;trength in Germany, where &s;he paid already 100,000 men, and expended five millions an|nually.</P>
<P>Although nothing &s;eems more certain in a general view of the political &s;y&s;tem, than that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia is not the natural and nece&s;&s;ary ally of this nation; yet his fortune neither was, &s;ince the beginning of the war, nor is it now a matter of indifference to us.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Shippin was of opinion, that the power of France was become an object of much le&s;s terror &s;ince the growth of the power of Ru&s;&s;ia. But he never imagined it po&s;&s;ible, that all the great continental powers of Europe &s;hould ever be united with France; and that they &s;hould con&s;pire to load her &s;cale in&s;tead of ballancing it. He never could fore&s;ee, what has actually happened in this war, that this very power of Ru&s;&s;ia could co-operate with France, and even with Sweden; and what is full as extraordinary, that both the&s;e latter could co-operate with Au&s;tria to de|&s;troy in effect the &s;y&s;tem, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the treaty of We&s;tphalia; that &s;y&s;tem, which it had been the great drift of policy, and the great object of war to both France and Sweden in the la&s;t century to e&s;tabli&s;h and
<PB N="438" REF="494">
to confirm, and to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria con&s;tantly to op|po&s;e. The de&s;truction of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;eemed to in|clude the de&s;truction of the treaty of We&s;tphalia; becau&s;e he is the only power in the empire capable of a&s;&s;erting the independency of its members, and &s;upporting the declining credit of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The total ruin of Saxony, with &s;uch circum&s;tances of unpardonable cruelty by that prince him&s;elf, and the ex|hau&s;ted &s;tate of all the other Prote&s;tant members of the empire, have narrowed that intere&s;t more and more to the &s;ingle object of Pru&s;&s;ia. As this intere&s;t was fir&s;t formed in the empire, &s;o its condition there cannot fail of having the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible influence on all the potentates of the &s;ame communion. Even in this light, England had an intere&s;t that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould not be entirely cru&s;hed by the prevalence of a combination compo&s;ed in &s;o extraordi|nary a manner, that its &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce a total revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of Europe, and draw on a &s;eries of con&s;equences, which, though it is impo&s;&s;ible to particularize, mu&s;t have undoubtedly been of the mo&s;t im|portant and alarming nature.</P>
<P>But there was an intere&s;t yet nearer to us, the fate of our own army in Germany, which could not &s;urvive the de&s;truction of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia for an hour. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances rendered the pro&s;pect of the campaign in Ger|many very gloomy; as there was no &s;ort of ground to &s;up|po&s;e that this prince, upon who&s;e fate &s;o many important intere&s;ts immediately depended, could hold out to the mid|dle of &s;ummer. Be&s;ides, Denmark &s;hewed no favourable di&s;po&s;itions towards us; and Holland di&s;covered evident marks of coldne&s;s, if not of ab&s;olute alienation. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition of the powers in the north.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern powers of Europe, who&s;e total inconnec|tion with the cau&s;es, and who&s;e great remotene&s;s from the &s;eat of war might appear &s;ufficient to en&s;ure their tranquil|lity, began to enter into action with a &s;pirit equal to that of any of the parties, who had from the beginning acted as principals; new fewel was heaped upon the fire of conten|tion, which had wa&s;ted &s;o many nations, ju&s;t as it &s;eemed to be on the point of expiring.</P>
<P>That alliance between the branches of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, of which we have &s;poken la&s;t year, and which is &s;o well known by the name of the Family Compact, is one
<PB N="439" REF="495">
of the mo&s;t extraordinary tran&s;actions of this, or, perhaps, of any time, It has already produced &s;ome effects an&s;wer|able to its de&s;ign; it may produce others &s;till more impor|tant; and on the whole mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an event of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, la&s;ting, and alarming influence.</P>
<P>The treaty of Vienna in 1756, between France and Au&s;tria, has certainly contributed not a little to give that new turn to affairs, by which almo&s;t all the di&s;cour&s;es, that have hitherto been written on the intere&s;ts of princes, are rendered erroneous, and of little u&s;e in future &s;pecula|tions. That treaty, however, though it &s;eems entirely to have disjointed the antient &s;y&s;tem of alliance by which France was formerly counterpoi&s;ed, may, po&s;&s;ibly, not be &s;o much a la&s;ting change, as a temporary and excentric de|viation from the &s;phere in which the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria had formerly moved, and into which it &s;eems &s;o &s;utiable to her natural and permanent intere&s;t to return. The Bourbon compact is of a different nature; and it &s;eems to have at length produced that intire union between the French and Spani&s;h monarchies, which was &s;o much dreaded on the death of Charles II. and which it was the great purpo&s;e of the treaty of partition, and the war of the grand alliance to prevent. We have &s;een it take place in our days, com|paratively with very little notice; &s;o much greater is our pre&s;ent &s;trength; or &s;o much greater was the apprehen&s;i|on in tho&s;e days, than the danger of the actual event in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was a bold pu&s;h in France to attempt, and an uncom|mon &s;ucce&s;s to procure, towards the clo&s;e of an unfortu|nate and di&s;graceful war, an alliance of this kind. France could not have expected from the mo&s;t fortunate i&s;&s;ue of her affairs, an advantage &s;o great as that which &s;he derived from her uncommon di&s;tre&s;&s;es. It is &s;ome time &s;ince the jealou&s;y of her power has began to abate. But in fact her &s;ecurity, and probably too her power, will be greatly in|crea&s;ed by this very circum&s;tance. In&s;tead of forming &s;uch an object as alarmed mankind, and again&s;t which all Eu|rope u&s;ed to unite, &s;he is her&s;elf become the centre of an alliance, which extends from the northern to the &s;outhern extemity of Europe; and &s;he was in this war, actually united with Ru&s;&s;ia, Sweden, Au&s;tria, the Empire, Spain, and Naples; to &s;ay nothing of Denmark, with which &s;he had al&s;o &s;ome connections.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="496">With other nations, however, her ties are comparative|ly &s;light: but the engagements of the Bourbon compact form rather an act of incorporation than an alliance. It contains &s;tipulations hitherto unheard of in any treaty. By the 23d and 24th articles, the &s;ubjects of the &s;everal branch|es of the hou&s;e of Bourbon are admitted to a mutual natu|ralization, and to a participation of &s;uch privileges and im|munities, as if they were natural born &s;ubjects of the coun|tries of their re&s;pective &s;overeigns. The direct trade to America forms the only exception to this comprehen&s;ive communitive of intere&s;ts. The tenor of this article is of in|finite con&s;equence to the general trading intere&s;t of Europe; all the &s;tates of which, by the 25th article of the &s;ame al|liance, are excluded from any pro&s;pect of obtaining &s;imilar advantages.</P>
<P>This forms a civil union in almo&s;t the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e; the political union is even more perfect. By the 1&s;t and 16th articles, the two monarchs of France and Spain agree to look upon every power as their enemy, which becomes an enemy of the other; that a war declared again&s;t either, &s;hall be regarded as per&s;onal by the other; and that, when they happen to be both engaged in a war again&s;t the &s;ame enemy or enemies, they will wage it jointly with their whole forces; and that their military operations &s;hall pro|ceed by common con&s;ent and with a perfect agreement.</P>
<P>By the 26th article, they agree reciprocally to di&s;clo&s;e to each other their alliances and negotiations.</P>
<P>By the 17th and 18th, they formally engage not to make, or even to li&s;ten, to any propo&s;al of peace from their com|mon enemies, but by mutual con&s;ent; being re&s;olved, in time of peace as well as in time of war, <HI>each mutually to con|&s;ider the intere&s;ts of the allied crown as its own; to compen|&s;ate their &s;everal lo&s;&s;es and advantages, and to act as if the two monarchies formed only one and the &s;ame power.</HI> The king of the Sicilies, and the infant duke of Parma are comprehend|ed in this treaty.</P>
<P>Here is the model of the mo&s;t perfect confederacy. There is but one re&s;triction to the extent of this &s;cheme; but this particular re&s;triction is a key to the whole treaty; as it &s;hews, in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner again&s;t what object it was principally directed. For by the 8th article it is provided, that Spain &s;hall not be bound to &s;uccour France, when &s;he is engaged in a war in con&s;equence of her engage|ments
<PB N="441" REF="497">
by the treaty of We&s;tphalia, or other alliances with the princes and &s;tates of Germany and the north, <HI>unle&s;s &s;ome maritime power takes part in tho&s;e wars,</HI> or France be attacked by land in her own country. This exception of the maritime powers indicates &s;ufficiently that the ten|dency of this article is to affect England, and &s;erves to point out clearly, though obliquely, to the other powers of Eu|rope, that their connection with England is the great cir|cum&s;tance which is to provoke the enmity of Spain.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that this treaty alone, when once its true nature came to be di&s;covered, if no other cau&s;e exi&s;ted, would have been &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify Great Britain in a de|claration of war again&s;t a monarchy, which had united it|&s;elf in &s;o intimate a manner with her enemy, that it was rendered impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other. In this point, however, prudence was to interpo&s;e, and circum&s;tances to direct. It was not therefore, untill eve|ry attempt to bring Spain to a clear declaration of pacific intentions had been tried without &s;ucce&s;s, in the manner &s;he have already &s;een, that war was actually declared again&s;t her. This declaration was made, on our part, in London, the 2d of January of the pre&s;ent year.</P>
<P>Since Great Britain was a kingdom, &s;he never was in &s;uch a doubtful and dangerous &s;ituation; for at this time we was engaged, directly or indirectly, in a war, not only with all the great continental powers, but, what is more material, with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the maritime &s;trength of Europe. According to the ordinary computa|tions, the navy of Spain con&s;i&s;ted of more than 100 men of war; and though the French navy was greatly reduced, it became of con&s;ideration when added to the Spani&s;h. Great efforts were made to render it re&s;pectable. Several communities in France engaged to fit out men of war at their own expence; and in general that whole people felt, after having been &s;unk under a long de&s;pondency, a momen|tary glow of hope and animation from this alliance, &s;o pow|erful in its real &s;trength, and in its principals &s;o flattering to the national vanity. The glory of their royal hou&s;e, was, on this occa&s;ion, united with the &s;afety of their country. They were reinforced by the mo&s;t cordial amity of a power untouched in its re&s;ources of men, money, and &s;tores; whil&s;t Great Britain was exhau&s;ted of men by her many
<PB N="442" REF="498">
victories, and her re&s;ources were &s;inking under a debt of more than one hundred millions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a rude &s;hock had been lately given to the &s;y&s;tem of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed, in &s;ome degree, likely to affect public credit. The part which Mr. Pitt might finally take, and the con&s;equences which might re&s;ult from his actions, were extremely undetermined; nor was it at all clear, what degree of harmony and real confi|dence continued among&s;t the &s;everal parts of the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting admini&s;tration. All the&s;e con&s;iderations could not fail of in&s;piring France with great confidence.</P>
<P>Great Britain, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, had, however, &s;ome things in her favour. The hope of plunder which always attends a Spani&s;h war, di&s;po&s;ed the minds of many towards the pre&s;ent; and was &s;ure to call forth a very vigo|rous exertion both of public and private &s;trength. This circum&s;tance al&s;o in&s;ured the &s;upplies.</P>
<P>With regard to the admini&s;tration, their delay in entering into this Spani&s;h war, contrary to the ideas of Mr. Pitt, his re&s;ignation in con&s;equence of this delay; the nece&s;&s;ity, which &s;o &s;oon after appeared, of engaging in ho&s;tilities, and which, to the bulk of the people, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the &s;entiments of that mini&s;ter, together with a recollection of the &s;ingular &s;pirit with which the French war had been car|ried on, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have excited them to the mo&s;t &s;trenous efforts, and to every act of laudable emulation. There was a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing, that the &s;pirit of the na|tion, and the wi&s;dom of its councils, were not confined to a &s;ingle man; and it was &s;hewn effectually.</P>
<P>We had al&s;o, to ballance the great &s;trength derived from the extraordinary combination of our enemies, that uni|form tenor of &s;ucce&s;s on our &s;ide, which made our people believe them&s;elves invincible. This was not an unground|ed pre&s;umption, or a dream of enthu&s;ia&s;m; their ju&s;t opini|on of &s;uperior courage, together with the &s;olid experience derived from &s;uch a variety of &s;ervices, and &s;o many &s;harp conflicts by &s;ea, and land, all combined to make our forces &s;eem, and be, almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Spain, on the other hand, had, in the very con&s;titution of her power, an e&s;&s;ential defect, which expo&s;ed her on this, as upon all other occa&s;ions. Her re&s;ources, though very great, are not within her&s;elf; and con&s;equently are not always at her command, being &s;ubject not only to be

intercepted by the operations of the war, but to be de|&s;troyed or lo&s;t by the ca&s;ualty of long voyages; and, in every event, are liable to delay and di&s;appointment.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Portugal threatened. Melancholy &s;tate of that kingdom. Arrogant propo&s;ition of the French and Spani&s;h mini&s;ters to the court of Li&s;bon. An&s;wer of that court. Several memorials. Re&s;olution of the king of Portugal. French and Spani&s;h mini&s;ters depart. War declared by tho&s;e powers again&s;t Portugal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUCH was our &s;ituation, both at home and abroad, at the breaking out of this new war. Something extraor|dinary was to be expected from the confederacy of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. It was not, however, altogether cer|tain where the &s;torm, that was gathering, would fall. There were apprehen&s;ions for the peace of Italy; Holland had &s;ome cau&s;e of dread; and menaces were u&s;ed in that quarter. But Portugal &s;eemed to be mo&s;t endangered, on account of her clo&s;e and natural connection with Great Britain, her internal weakne&s;s, the antient claims of the Catholic king, and the opportunity of inva&s;ion; that kingdom being on all &s;ides, except to the &s;ea, in a manner inclo&s;ed by Spain.</P>
<P>Public conjecture was not mi&s;taken in fixing upon Por|tugal. No mention was made, indeed, of the Spani&s;h pre|ten&s;ions to that crown; but a re&s;olution was taken not only to oblige her to renounce all friend&s;hip, but to violate her neutrality with Great Britain.</P>
<P>No attempt was ever de&s;igned with le&s;s appearance of ju&s;tice; no propo&s;ition was ever made with more arrogance and de&s;poti&s;m to an independent &s;overeign; and no &s;cheme &s;eemed, according to every human appearance, &s;o certain of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Portugal, on the recovery of her li|berty; which happened in the year 1640, found her&s;elf &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e acqui&s;itions, in both Indies, which had been the principal &s;ources of her power, and the great monuments of the captivity of her former kings and commanders. During the interval of her &s;ub|jection, new commerical powers had ri&s;en, &s;ome on the

ruins of her fortune, and others upon different but not le&s;s &s;ub&s;tantial foundations. though the Brazils were recover|ed, and Goa and &s;ome other places in India remained &s;till to Portugal, her maritime power, and the &s;hare of trade, on which it depended, were not recoverable. Contrary to the fate of other nations, who have &s;haken off a foreign do|minion, &s;he did not owe her liberty to great abilities. Whil&s;t the United Provinces were fir&s;t freed, and after|wards aggrandized, by the capacity of the princes of Orange, and whil&s;t Pru&s;&s;ia, from an incon&s;iderable and de|pendent principality, grew into a formidable monarchy by the genuis of her &s;overeigns, Portugal continued to lan|gui&s;h in a &s;tate of mediocrity. Without any &s;ymptoms of danger to her exi&s;tence, &s;he &s;uffered a gradual decay of her power and con&s;ideration. The character of her govern|ment was narrow and biggoted, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of her commerce prepo&s;terous. If, on the one hand, a long peace added to the re&s;ources of her revenue, it, on the other, ab&s;olutely annihilated her military; and no country in the world had an army &s;o complete in numbers, &s;o ill furni&s;h|ed with arms, &s;o deficient in di&s;cipline, and &s;o wholly un|provided of able and experienced officers.</P>
<P>In this condition &s;he &s;uffered a fatal blow from the earth|quake in 1756. The wealthy and flouri&s;hing city of Li&s;bon was laid level with the ground; near 30,000 of the inha|bitants were buried in the ruins; and tho&s;e who remained, with the court it&s;elf, were reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>As if this earthquake, which overturned their capital, had al&s;o &s;haken and de&s;tracted the frame of their government, and the temper of their minds, the mo&s;t dreadful di&s;tempers broke out in the &s;tate, A &s;eries of horrid crimes, and of cruel puni&s;hments, &s;ucceeded to this calamity. The mo&s;t noble and wealthy family of Portugal, having engaged it|&s;elf in a &s;acrilegious attempt on the life of their &s;overeign, was cut off at once, with little di&s;tinction of &s;ex or age, by a bloody and dreadful exertion of ju&s;tice. Many others, who were accu&s;ed or &s;u&s;pected, &s;uffered death, or exile, or impri&s;onment. Among&s;t the&s;e, and from the &s;ame cau|&s;es, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable religious orders for wealth, influence, and policy, was &s;tripped of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and intirely driven out of the country.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances left this unhappy kingdom in the
<PB N="445" REF="503">
utmo&s;t weakne&s;s and confu&s;ion. All tho&s;e, and they were not a few, who were attached by connection of blood or intere&s;t to the nobles that had &s;uffered, or by religious pre|judice to the Je&s;uits who had been expelled, could never be cordially relied upon by the crown, and were probably as little inclined to any extraordinary efforts in favour of a government, which their re&s;entments mu&s;t have repre&s;ent|ed to them as no better than a bloody tyranny.</P>
<P>The Bourbon confederacy had &s;ome ground to &s;uppo&s;e that Portugal, in this &s;ituation, would not have courage to with&s;tand their menaces, and much le&s;s ability for any long time to re&s;i&s;t their efforts. The Spani&s;h army over&s;pread the frontiers of Portugal; the commerce of corn between the two kingdoms was prohibited, and every thing threat|ened a &s;udden inva&s;ion. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e ho&s;tile preparations,

 <MILESTONE N="Mar. 6."> 

 the French and Spani&s;h mi|ni&s;ters presented a joint memorial to the court of Li&s;bon which was followed by &s;everal others. The pur|port of the&s;e memorials was to per&s;uade his mo&s;t faithful maje&s;ty to enter into the alliance, and co-operate in the mea&s;ures of the two crowns, again&s;t Great Britain.</P>
<P>It was not ea&s;y to find very convincing arguments to in|duce Portugal to adopt &s;o extraordinary a change of &s;y&s;tem. The united crowns, in a memorial which was &s;igned by the amba&s;&s;adors of both, in&s;i&s;ted largely on the tyranny which Great Britain exerted upon all powers, e&s;pecially the maritime, and upon Portugal among the re&s;t; on the par|ticular in&s;ult which had been offered to her juri&s;diction, by Bo&s;cawen's attack on de la Clue's &s;quadron in a Portugue&s;e harbour; on that affinity, by which the two monarchs of Spain and Portugal are as clo&s;ely connected by the ties of blood, as all powers are by a common intere&s;t, to oppo&s;e the ambitious de&s;igns of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Whatever the&s;e arguments were deficient in rea&s;on, was made up by a &s;trong in&s;inuation of force. The memorial concluded with a declaration, that, as &s;oon as his mo&s;t faith|ful maje&s;ty had taken his re&s;olution, which they doubted not would prove favourable, their army was ready to enter Portugal, and to garri&s;on the principal ports of that king|dom, in order to prevent the dangers to which they might be expo&s;ed from the attempts of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The two mini&s;ters added to this extraordinary memori|al, that they were ordered by their courts to demand a ca|tegorical
<PB N="444" REF="504">

an&s;wer in four days; and that any delay, beyond that time, &s;hould be con&s;idered as a negative.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Portugal was at this time certainly wor|thy of compa&s;&s;ion. If, contrary to her known intere&s;ts, contrary to her antient connections, and to the faith of treaties, &s;he &s;hould engage in this offen&s;ive alliance, &s;he mu&s;t expect to &s;ee her territories and her colonies expo&s;ed to the formidable navies of England. This however dan|gerous conde&s;cen&s;ion was not to &s;ecure her, by her own act, &s;he would have put her&s;elf, bound hand and foot, into the power of the Bourbon alliance; and having received foreign garri&s;ons into all her places of &s;trength, would have reduced her&s;elf to the condition of a province to Spain. On the other hand, if &s;he adhered to her faith, and at|tempted to maintain her independency, an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men was ready to enter her territories, which contained no place of real &s;trength, and which had not twenty thou&s;and troops, and tho&s;e ill armed, and wor&s;e di&s;ciplined, to defend it.</P>
<P>In this emergency, the firmne&s;s of the king of Portugal was eminent, and &s;uch as mu&s;t deliver his name to po&s;terity with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed advantage. He re&s;olved &s;tea|dily to adhere to his antient and natural alliance, and to brave all dangers and difficulties, that he might pre&s;erve his fidelity inviolable; following that generous maxim of king John of France, that if good faith were to be bani&s;hed from all other parts of the world, it ought to be found in the brea&s;t of &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>His an&s;wer to this in&s;ulting propo&s;ition was humble and moderate, but firm: he ob&s;erved, that the ties, which equally united him to Great Britain and the two crowns, rendered him as proper a mediator to them all, as they made it improper for him to declare him&s;elf an enemy to any of them; that his alliance with England was antient, and therefore could give no offence at this conjuncture; that it was purely defen&s;ive, and therefore innocent in all its circum&s;tances; that the late &s;ufferings of Portugal di&s;abled her (in ca&s;e &s;he were willing) from taking part in an offen|&s;ive war, into the calamities of which, neither the love his faithful maje&s;ty bore to his &s;ubjects as a father, nor the du|ty by which he was bound to them as a king, could &s;uffer him to plunge them. Finally, he reminded the catholic king of his pacific di&s;po&s;itions, by which, on former occa|&s;ions,
<PB N="447" REF="507">
he had yielded &s;o much, to pre&s;erve peace between the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>This rea&s;onable and moderate an&s;wer drew on replies, which more and more di&s;clo&s;ed the true character and &s;pi|rit of the Bourbon confederacy. They denied that the al|liance with England was purely defen&s;ive, or intirely inno|cent; and for this unheard-of rea&s;on, that the defen&s;ive al|liance is converted into an offen&s;ive one, <HI>from the &s;ituation of the Portugue&s;e dominions, and from the nature of the Engli&s;h power:</HI> the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, &s;aid they, cannot keep the &s;ea in all &s;ea&s;ons, nor cruize on the principal coa&s;ts for cutting off the French and Spani&s;h navigation, without the ports and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Portugal; that the&s;e i&s;land|ers could not in&s;ult all maritime Europe, if all the riches of Portugal did not pa&s;s into their hands; that therefore Por|tugal furni&s;hes them with the means to make war; and their alliance with the court of Great Britain is offen|&s;ive.</P>
<P>Certainly, the <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of a country was never before given as a rea&s;on, however it might have &s;erved as a &s;ecret motive, for declaring war again&s;t it. Nor was it before heard, that the common advantages of trade, derived from a neutral nation, could be deemed an act of ho&s;tility. The&s;e were rather in&s;ults than arguments. And the whole pro|ceedings of the united crowns were in the &s;ame &s;train; they undertook to judge for Portugal of the pretended yoke which was impo&s;ed upon her by England, and which &s;he could not her&s;elf di&s;cover; to re&s;ent injuries for her, for which &s;he had received and accepted &s;atisfaction; and, as if this had not been indignity &s;ufficient, they in&s;ultingly inform the king of Portugal, that <HI>he ought to be glad of the necece&s;&s;i|ty which they laid upon him to make u&s;e of his rea&s;on, in order to take the road of his glory, and the common intere&s;t.</HI> This nece&s;&s;ity was the immediate march of their army to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions.</P>
<P>So extraordinary a treatment neither intimidated the king from the firmne&s;s of his re&s;olution, nor provoked him to change from the moderation of his language. He main|tained, that the treaties of league and commerce, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Portugal and Great Britain, are &s;uch as the law of God, of nature, and of nations, have always deemed innocent. He intreated their mo&s;t chri&s;tian and catholic maje&s;ties to open their eyes to the crying inju&s;tice
<PB N="448" REF="508">
of pur&s;uing again&s;t Portugal, the war kindled again&s;t Great Britain; he de&s;ired them to con&s;ider, that they were giving an example, which would produce the de&s;truction of man|kind; that there was an end of the public &s;afety, if neutral nations were to be attacked, becau&s;e they have defen&s;ive treaties with the belligerent powers; that a maxim &s;o de|&s;tructive would occa&s;ion de&s;olation in all Europe, the mo|ment a war was kindled between any two &s;tates; that, there|fore, if their troops &s;hould enter his dominions, he would, in defence of his neutrality, endeavour to repul&s;e them with all his forces, and tho&s;e of his allies; and he concluded with this magnanimous declaration, that <HI>it would affect him le&s;s, though reduced to the la&s;t extremity, of which the Great Judge is the &s;ole arbiter, to let the la&s;t tile of his palace fall, and to &s;ee his faithful &s;ubjects &s;pill the la&s;t drop of their blood, than to &s;acrifice, together with the honour of his crown, all that Portugal holds mo&s;t dear; and to &s;ub|mit, by &s;uch extraordinary means, to become an unheard-of example to all pacific powers, who will no longer be able to enjoy the benefit of neutrality, whenever a war &s;hall be kindled between other powers, with which the former are connected by defen&s;ive treaties.</HI> When this final re&s;olution was thus &s;piritedly declared, pa&s;&s;ports were de|manded for the amba&s;&s;adors of the two crowns,

<P>We have dwelt &s;ome time upon this tran&s;action: we hope the reader will not think the narrative drawn into a blameable length. The &s;ubject is intere&s;ting, the proce|dure uncommon, and the example alarming. This war again&s;t Portugal was the fir&s;t fruit of the Bourbon compact: they &s;hewed very early to the world, what it was to expect from the maturity of this league; when they were &s;o ele|vated by the &s;uperiority they imagined they had attained, even in forming it, that they thought them&s;elves di&s;pen&s;ed from tho&s;e decorums, and plau&s;ible appearances, which the mo&s;t ambitious princes commonly make u&s;e of, in the exe|cution of their mo&s;t ambitious de&s;igns. If they had invad|ed Portugal without any declaration at all, it might, per|haps, be con&s;idered as a piece of convenient inju&s;tice, which they left to the previous nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ub&s;equent &s;ucce&s;s of their affairs, to ju&s;tify as they could; but &s;o many memo|rials

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have &s;een, in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t year, that by the taking of Colberg, on one hand, and Schweidnitz, on the other, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions were entirely at the mercy of his enemies: his forces were worn away, and even his efforts had gradually declined: a complete victory, tho' this was an event not at all probable, could not &s;ave him. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by wintering in Pomerania, and by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Colberg, which in&s;ured them &s;upplies by a &s;afe and expeditious channel, were in a condition to commence their operations much earlier than u&s;ual, as well as to &s;u&s;tain them with more &s;pirit and uniformity. No re&s;ource of policy could be tried with the lea&s;t expectation of &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;uch a re&s;i&s;tance for five years, of which the world never furni&s;hed another example, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had nothing left but &s;uch a conduct, as might clo&s;e the &s;cene with glory, &s;ince there was &s;o little appearance of his concluding the war with &s;afety.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e gloomy appearances, his inveterate and inflexible enemy, the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, died, in the &s;ixty-third year of her age,

 <MILESTONE N="Jan. 2."> 

 and the twenty-&s;econd of her reign.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="510">This prince&s;s was &s;econd daughter to Peter the Great and a de&s;cendant not altogether unworthy of that illu&s;trious founder of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. From being little better than a pri&s;oner, &s;he became in a moment a de&s;potic &s;ove|reign. At the acce&s;&s;ion of this prince&s;s, the Ru&s;&s;ian power, &s;o newly created, &s;eemed to be in danger of a decline, from the many revolutions to which the empire had been &s;ubject; and the in&s;titutions of Peter the Great, by which that ex|ten&s;ive part of the world was drawn out of barbari&s;m, be|gan perceivably to decay, until her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, when the former was put out of all que&s;tion by the vigour of her government, and the latter cheri&s;hed and promoted by the encouragement which &s;he gave to every valuable art and &s;cience. The academy at Peter&s;burgh is at pre&s;ent one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in Europe, and has already enriched the learned world with con&s;iderable di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In fact, &s;he governed the Ru&s;&s;ian empire with more lenity than any of her predece&s;&s;ors; and, perhaps, carried this amiable di&s;po&s;ition to an impolitic acce&s;s. She regu|lated and increa&s;ed her finances; kept alive, and even in|crea&s;ed, the di&s;cipline of her armies; and in all her tran&s;|actions with foreign &s;tates, and in the various faces which her politics a&s;&s;umed, &s;he always &s;upported the dignity and importance of her country at the highe&s;t point. For her private plea&s;ures, indeed, &s;he has been much cen&s;ured; but as they were merely plea&s;ures, and of &s;uch a nature that &s;en|timent had little &s;hare in them, they had little influence on her public conduct, which was always manly and firm.</P>
<P>The part &s;he took in this war, though it might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have been dictated by re&s;entment, was at the fame time the re&s;ult of the &s;ounde&s;t policy. No power, but that of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, was capable of checking hers. He was, not only from his &s;trength and character, but from the &s;ituation of his dominions, the only prince in Europe from whom it could be materially her intere&s;t to make conque&s;ts. By the retention of Pru&s;&s;ia, and by the dominion which in another name, &s;he held over the dutchy of Courland, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very great &s;hare of the Baltic coa&s;t, and thereby po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means of becoming a maritime power of the fir&s;t order. With the&s;e advantages, &s;he might ea&s;ily com|plete all that had been wanting, towards e&s;tabli&s;hing an un|controulable power over Poland. By the &s;ame means &s;he might entirely over-awe Denmark and Sweden; and al&s;o,
<PB N="451" REF="511">
by her vicinity, &s;he would be enabled to interpo&s;e in the concerns of Germany, with much more authority than &s;he had hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; although her intervention had always been of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In reality, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;eemed to make far greater &s;acrifices of her intere&s;t to her re&s;entment than Ru&s;&s;ia did, with whom tho&s;e two principals went hand in hand, and &s;upported each other. For nothing is more evident, than that Ru&s;&s;ia would &s;et up for a defender of the liberties of Germany, if ever &s;he got any footing in its neighbourhood; that &s;he would animate the powers there to a&s;&s;ert a greater degree of independence than they do at pre&s;ent; that &s;he would render, by her machinations, the empire in the Au|&s;trian family very precarious; and might even find means of &s;etting &s;ome feeble prince on the imperial throne, in order to embroil the whole Germanic body, and to keep it in en|tire dependence upon Ru&s;&s;ia. On the whole, if the projects of Au&s;tria had &s;ucceeded in their full extent, &s;he would have very &s;oon found in Ru&s;&s;ia a more powerful re&s;traint than ever &s;he had either in France or Sweden, even in the great|e&s;t heights of their power and credit in Germany. She would, indeed, have ruined the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; but &s;he would have purcha&s;ed his ruin with her own independency.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the pro&s;pects that lay before all political rea|&s;oners at the time of the death of the empre&s;s Elizabeth. Charles Peter Ulric, of the hou&s;e of Hol&s;tein, who had been created grand duke of Ru&s;&s;ia, and appointed heir ap|parent to that va&s;t empire by the late czarina, &s;ucceeded, under the name of Peter III. None but tho&s;e who were intimately acquainted with the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the new czar, could have any rea&s;on to imagine that he would abandon the &s;y&s;tem of his predece&s;&s;or, which was certainly founded on the true intere&s;t of the country he go|verned. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf &s;eemed for &s;ome time to have entertained no great hopes from this change. The czar had, however, &s;ometimes di&s;covered marks of e&s;teem for the character of this monarch. He had the black eagle, of which order the king of Pru&s;&s;ia is grand ma&s;ter. But the king of Pru&s;&s;ia could place very little confidence in this: however, with that air of plea&s;antry, which never entirely for&s;ook him in all his misfortunes, he &s;aid in a letter to Mr. Mitchel, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at the Ru&s;&s;ian court, "Is not this a very extraordinary knight, to feed 80,000 men at my

expence? He is the only one of my knights that takes that liberty. If every knight of the garter did the &s;ame, your England (England though it is) would be devoured by them. I beg you would endeavour to make my knight more trac|table, and tell him it is again&s;t the in&s;titutes of the order, for a knight to eat up his grand ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>The eyes of all Europe were now fixed upon the &s;teps which the czar might take. With regard to the govern|ment of his country, nothing could be more popular and au&s;picious than his fir&s;t mea&s;ures. The earlie&s;t u&s;e he made of his ab&s;olute power, was to &s;et the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility and gentry free, and to put them on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e of their rank in the other more moderate governments of Europe. Almo&s;t all the exiles were recalled to court, and among&s;t the re&s;t the unfortunate count Biron, who, from a &s;overeign prince, had been reduced to the mo&s;t wretched condition, in the mo&s;t wretched country on the globe. He had been many years a pea&s;ant of Siberia, and may very probably once more become a &s;overeign prince. It is in tho&s;e de&s;potic governments we &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;triking exce&s;&s;es, and di&s;mal rever&s;es of fortune; in which one day a per&s;on is rai&s;ed to &s;omething almo&s;t above man, and the next is perhaps in a moment degraded to the lowe&s;t &s;tation of hu|manity.</P>
<P>The new emperor proceeded in his reformation to aboli&s;h &s;ome &s;evere and tyrannical juri&s;dictions, and intending the &s;ame benign di&s;po&s;ition to all degrees of his &s;ubjects, he le&s;&s;ened the tax upon &s;alt, to the very great and univer&s;al relief of the poor.</P>
<P>The&s;e beginnings gave the mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ions of his dome&s;tic government. But Europe was principally con|cerned in his foreign politics. It was not long before his di&s;po&s;itions to peace became apparent. What a&s;toni&s;hed the world, was the high rate at which he valued this ble&s;&s;ing. In a memorial, which he cau&s;ed to be delivered on the 23d of February, to the mini&s;ters of the allied courts, he declar|ed, that, <HI>in order to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, he was ready to &s;acrifice all the conque&s;ts made by the arms of Ru&s;&s;ia in this war, in hopes that the allied courts will on their parts equally prefer the re&s;toration of peace and tranquillity, to the advan|tages which they might expect from the continuance of the war, but which they cannot obtain but by a continuance of the effu&s;ion of human blood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="513">The allies prai&s;ed the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;pirit, and huma|nity of this declaration; but recommended to his attention the fidelity to treaties, which con&s;titutes a no le&s;s valuable part of the royal character, and a no le&s;s con&s;iderable branch of the duty of a monarch to his &s;ubjects. They &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to imitate his de&s;ire for peace, but by no means to follow his example in purcha&s;ing it by a ce&s;&s;ion of all the advantages, which they had acquired, or hoped to acquire by the war.</P>
<P>The Czar having thus far complied with decency, and being of a character little fitted to wait the &s;low procedure of a joint negotiation, gave way to his ardent de&s;ires for peace, and to the &s;entiments of that extravagant admiration, which he had conceived for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. A &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of ho&s;tilities was concluded between them on the 16th of March; and it was followed not long after by a treaty of peace and alliance.

 <MILESTONE N="May 5."> 

 Nothing was &s;tipulated by the czar in favour of the former con|federates, whom he entirely abandoned. He even agreed to join his troops to tho&s;e of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to act again&s;t them. In a little time a Ru&s;&s;ian army was &s;een in conjunc|tion with one of Pru&s;&s;ia, to drive out of Sile&s;ia tho&s;e Au&s;tri|ans, who had been a few months before brought into that province by the Ru&s;&s;ian arms.</P>
<P>This was a miraculous revolution. Fortune who had &s;o long abandoned the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to his genuis, after ha|ving per&s;ecuted him for near five years, and overpowered him with the whole weight of her anger, at length made amends by a &s;udden turn, and did for him at one &s;troke the only thing, by which he could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Sweden who &s;ince &s;he has recovered her liberty has lo&s;t her political importance, and for a long time acted entirely under the direction of Ru&s;&s;ian councils, followed on this, as on all other occa&s;ions, the example of the courts of Peter&s;|burgh, and &s;igned a treaty of peace with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia on the 22d of May.</P>
<P>In order to account for whatever was not the re&s;ult of mere per&s;onal character in this extraordinary revolution of politics in Ru&s;&s;ia, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remind the reader, that the czar Peter the third was duke of Hol&s;tein; and that the dukes of Hol&s;tein had preten&s;ions to the dutchy of Sle&s;|wick. The&s;e preten&s;ions were compromi&s;ed by a treaty in 1732. But as the ce&s;&s;ion made by the hou&s;e of Hol&s;tein in
<PB N="454" REF="514">
this treaty was the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, it had been always apprehended that &s;he would make u&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;afe oppor|tunity of reclaiming her antient rights. The czar &s;ei&s;ed eagerly on the great one, which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Ru&s;&s;ian power afforded him, and he re&s;olved to enter into an immediate war for this object, to which his predilection for his native country gave in his eyes a far greater impor|tance than to all the conque&s;ts of his predece&s;&s;or. As long as this war with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble that his de&s;igns again&s;t Denmark could be pro&s;ecuted with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s. Wholly indifferent therefore to all others, and pa&s;&s;ionately fond of this object, as &s;oon as he came to the throne, without any di&s;pute or negotiation, he offered the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in his great di&s;tre&s;s every thing he could have hoped from a &s;eries of victories, and whil&s;t he joined his arms to tho&s;e of that monarch in Sile&s;ia, he cau&s;ed an army to march towards Hol&s;tein.</P>
<P>Thus the peace with Ru&s;&s;ia, far from conducing to the general peace of Europe, did very little more than change the face of the war. It brought in new &s;ubjects of di&s;pute, and new parties, and by threatning Denmark, left not a &s;in|gle power in the north in a &s;tate of a&s;&s;ured tranquillity.</P>
<P>The king of Denmark, though threatned by &s;o formida|ble a power engaged in pur&s;uit of a favourite object, was not terrified into any mean conce&s;&s;ions. He recruited His army, repaired his fortifications, and prepared for his defence; with temper and magnanimty. As money mu&s;t be much wanting for the &s;ervices of &s;o important a war, as his coun|try could furni&s;h no great &s;upplies, and the borrowings in every part of Europe, together with the &s;udden inva&s;ion of his dominions, could enable him to form no &s;anguine hopes of public credit, he turned his eyes towards the city of Ham|burgh, which had enriched it&s;elf by its indu&s;try and neu|trality during the whole war, and by the number of wealthy per&s;ons who had fled there for refuge from the calamities, which all the neighbouring countries had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>His Dani&s;h maje&s;ty had always kept alive a claim of &s;overeignty over that city, which (whoever founded) he exerci&s;ed whenever he found him&s;elf able. He thought the pre&s;ent one of tho&s;e conjunctures. Therefore without any previous notice he appears with a &s;trong army before Hamburg,

<PB N="455" REF="515">
immediately &s;ubmit to a loan of 1,000,000 of rix dollars. The magi&s;trates of this trading city, little prepared for, or accu&s;tomed to war, having no ally at hand, and who would be equally endangered by the &s;trength of any ally able to protect them, prudently &s;ubmitted, and furni&s;hed the king with &s;uch a &s;upply as his affairs required.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia lo&s;t no time to profit of this great and unexpected revolution in his favour. The neutrality of the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;till left the Au&s;trians much &s;uperior to him Their alliance brought him to an equality. Two Au&s;trian armies in Sile&s;ia and one in Saxony, were prepared to act, and it was not clear which &s;ide would begin to act on the offen&s;ive; the Au&s;trian armies threatened Glogau and Bre&s;|law with a &s;iege, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's threatened Sch|weidnitz.</P>
<P>The active character of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the caution of mar&s;hal Daun, &s;oon determined the part which the &s;everal armies were to take, and the &s;pirit of the &s;everal operations.

 <MILESTONE N="May 12."> 

 Very early in the camp|paign prince Henry made a vigorous pu&s;h on the imperial po&s;ts towards the frontiers of Saxony. The Im|periali&s;ts were obliged to evacuate Dippol&s;walda with &s;ome lo&s;s in killed. About four thou&s;and men were taken pri&s;o|ners; 356 waggons were al&s;o taken, and &s;everal military trophies,</P>
<P>By this &s;ignal advantage, all the part of Saxony, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Pru&s;&s;ians, was effectually &s;ecured; and any attempt which might hereafter be thought proper for the recovery of Dre&s;den, was much facilitated. Although the Au&s;trians, &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;equence of this lo&s;s, and largely reinforce|ed from the armies in Sile&s;ia, attempted to recover the&s;e po&s;ts by &s;everal lively efforts, they were repul&s;ed with no &s;mall &s;laughter on both &s;ides; and prince Henry remained &s;o much ma&s;ter of Saxony, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep a large army from the war in Sile&s;ia, to prevent if po&s;&s;ible his making irruptions into the very heart of Bohemia.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty derived advantages from the conduct of his brother, which he did not neglect to improve. It was not until the latter end of June that he was joined by his new Ru&s;&s;ian allies. As &s;oon as this junction was formed, he re&s;olved to make a tryal of what the&s;e men could do in his favour, who had acted &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t him. Mar|&s;hal Daun's army occupied &s;everal &s;trong, but detached emi|nences,
<PB N="456" REF="516">
which enabled him to communicate with and pro|tect Schweidnitz from all attempts of the enemy. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia undertook to di&s;lodge,

 <MILESTONE N="July 21."> 

 him from tho&s;e advantageous po&s;ts. In &s;ome of his at|tempts he &s;ucceeded, in others he was baffled with &s;ome lo&s;s.</P>
<P>This was no regular battle; but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, though he did not &s;ucceed immediately in his attack, yet by his judicious manoeuvres he attained all the advantages he propo&s;ed from his enterpri&s;e. For mar&s;hal Daun, appre|hen&s;ive from the motions of his army, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia intended to &s;eize upon his principal magazine, and even cut off his communication with Bohemia, abandon|ed tho&s;e important po&s;ts which he had hitherto maintained with &s;ucce&s;s, fell back to the extremities of Sile&s;ia, and left Schweidnitz entirely uncovered.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia immediately prepared to inve&s;t that city whil&s;t different detachments of Pru&s;&s;ians, &s;ome on the &s;ide of Saxony, others on the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, penetrated deep into Bohemia, laid many parts of the country under contri|bution, and &s;pread an univer&s;al alarm. It was about five Years &s;ince they had been driven from thence by the victo|rious arms of mar&s;hal Daun, who now found him&s;elf unable to protect that kingdom from their ravages. A con&s;iderable body of Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars al&s;o made an irruption into Bo|hemia, and began there to retaliate on the Au&s;trians tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, which they had them&s;elves &s;o often before com|mitted on the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions,</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was thus playing with &s;pirit the great game which fortune had put into his hands, he was all at once threatened with a &s;udden rever&s;e, by ano|ther revolution in Ru&s;&s;ia, which bore all the appearance of being as unfavourable to him, as the former had been be|yond all hopes beneficial. The variable political climate of Ru&s;&s;ia, under who&s;e influence all his fortune decayed or flouri&s;hed, was covered with a &s;udden cloud by the depo|&s;ition, followed clo&s;e by the death, of his fa&s;t friend, and faithful ally, the czar of Mu&s;covy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the moment of the late czar's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of the Ru&s;&s;ia's, &s;omething extraordinary was ex|pected. His di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed to lead him to make altera|tions in every thing, and having &s;et before him&s;elf two great examples, that of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and of his predece&s;&s;or Peter I. it was expected that this va&s;t empire was going once more, almo&s;t within the life of a man, to a&s;&s;ume a new face; a circum&s;tance which could not fail of having a &s;eri|ous influence on the affairs of Europe. Peter III. made more new regulations in Ru&s;&s;ia in a few weeks, than wi&s;e and cautious princes undertake in a long reign. It was to be feared that his actions were rather guided by a ra&s;h and irregular turn of mind, and the &s;pirit of innovation, than by any regular and well dige&s;ted plan, for the improvement of his exten&s;ive dominions.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t actions on coming to the throne, it is true, were laudable, and &s;eemed well calculated to acquire him the af|fections of his people. But if in &s;ome in&s;tances he con&s;ulted their intere&s;ts, in many he &s;hocked their prejudices; and he lo&s;t thereby that opinion, which is on all occa&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary, but is particularly &s;o for carrying &s;uch uncommon de&s;igns as his into execution.</P>
<P>The power of the czar's though ab&s;olute and uncontrou|lable in its exerci&s;e, is extremely weak in its foundation. There is not perhaps in Europe a government which de|pends &s;o much on the good will and affection of tho&s;e that are governed; and which requires a greater degree of vigi|lance and a &s;teadier hand. The regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which has been &s;o often broken, and the great change of manners, which in le&s;s than a century has been introduced, have left in Ru&s;&s;ia a weakne&s;s amid&s;t all the appearance of &s;trength, and a great facility to &s;udden and dangerous revolutions.</P>
<P>Peter III. paid little attention to tho&s;e difficulties, which
<PB N="458" REF="518">
to him were the greater, as he was a foreigner born. They were augmented by the &s;uperior and invidious regard he &s;eemed to pay to foreign intere&s;ts, and foreign per&s;ons. The preference he &s;o manife&s;tly gave to the uncertain hope of incon&s;iderable conque&s;t in Hol&s;tein over the &s;olid and valu|able po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which the fortune of his predece&s;&s;or had left him, mu&s;t have di&s;gu&s;ted all the politicians of his country. His intimate connection with, and boundle&s;s admiration of that prince, with whom Ru&s;&s;ia had been &s;o lately, and &s;o long, in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t violent ho&s;tility, could not add to the opinion of his prudence. They did not think he &s;ufficiently con&s;ulted his dignity, in &s;oliciting with great anxiety a command in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice. When he re|ceived it, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the Pru&s;&s;ian uniform, made a grand fe&s;tival, and di&s;played all the marks of an immode|rate and puerile &s;atisfaction. He pu&s;hed his extravagance in this point &s;o far, that he made preparations in this im|mature &s;tate of his government to quit Ru&s;&s;ia, and to go into Germany for the &s;ake of an interview with that great monarch, who&s;e genius, principles and fortune he &s;o greatly admired.</P>
<P>Although this proceeding was, almo&s;t in every re&s;pect, extremely impolitic, it did not threaten &s;o dangerous con&s;e|quences as the other &s;teps, which he took about the &s;ame time. Nothing requires &s;o much judgment, and &s;o nice a hand, as to effect a change in the &s;ettled e&s;tabli&s;hments of any country. Above all, there mu&s;t be &s;omething favour|able in the conjuncture; or &s;omething &s;o uncommon and over-ruling in the genius of the conductor of tho&s;e changes, as will render him &s;uperior to all difficulties. This latter was the ca&s;e of Peter I. who had indeed very little favour|able in the conjuncture; but he did every thing by his ca|pacity, courage, and per&s;everance. The &s;oldiery and the eccle&s;ia&s;tics are the great &s;upports of all ab&s;olute rule, and they are certainly the la&s;t bodies, upon which a prince of this kind would chu&s;e to exert any invidious act of autho|rity. But the czar was indi&s;creet enough, very early in his reign, highly to provoke both the&s;e bodies; the &s;oldiery, by the manife&s;t preference he gave to his Hol&s;tein guards, and to all officers of that nation; and by the change he made in favour of the Pru&s;&s;ian uniform to the exclu&s;ion of that, in which the Ru&s;&s;ians believed they had &s;o often a&s;&s;ert|ed the honour of their country, and gained many &s;ignal ad|vantages
<PB N="459" REF="519">
over the troops di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e regimentals which were now preferred</P>
<P>The&s;e trifles had very important con&s;equences. But what he did in matters of religion was &s;till more dangerous. This prince had been educated a Luthern; and though he con|formed to the Greek church, in order to qualify him&s;elf for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he never &s;hewed much re&s;pect to that mode of religion, to the rites and doctrines of which his &s;ubjects had been always extremely attached. He &s;eized upon the revenues of the clergy, whether monks or &s;eculars, whether bi&s;hops or inferiors, and for compen&s;ation allowed them &s;ome mean pen&s;ions, in &s;uch a proportion as his fancy &s;ugge&s;ted. His capricious order that the clergy &s;hould be no longer di&s;|tingui&s;hed by beards, was in it&s;elf of le&s;s moment, but it was hardly le&s;s offen&s;ive. He made al&s;o &s;ome regulations concerning the images and pictures in their churches, which gave them rea&s;on to apprehend his intention of accompli&s;h|ing a total change in the religion of the empire, and intro|ducing Lutherani&s;m.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was taking the&s;e mea&s;ures to alienate the minds of his people in general, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e bodies, with whom it was the mo&s;t his intere&s;t to be well, he had not the good fortune to live in union with his own family. He had long &s;lighted his con&s;ort, a prince&s;s of the hou&s;e of Anhalt Zerb&s;t, a woman of a ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, and by who&s;e councils he might have profited. He lived in a very public manner with the counte&s;s of Woronzoff, niece to the chancellor of that name, and &s;eemed devoted to her with &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion, that it was apprehended he had &s;ome thoughts of throwing his empre&s;s into a mona&s;tery, and rai&s;ing this lady to the throne of all the Ru&s;&s;ias. What &s;eemed to confirm this opinion, was his omitting formally to declare his &s;on the grand duke Paul Petrowitz the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. This omi&s;&s;ion in a country where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is e&s;tabli&s;hed and regular, would have been of no con&s;equence; the punctual ob&s;ervance of &s;uch a ceremony would rather have betrayed &s;ome doubt of the title. But the nature of this government, as well as po&s;&s;itive con&s;titutions, had made it nece&s;&s;ary in Ru&s;&s;ia, and the omi&s;&s;ion was certainly alarming.</P>
<P>That unfortunate prince, having in this manner affronted his army, irritated his clergy, offended his nobility, and alienated his own family, without having left him&s;elf any firm ground of authority, in per&s;onal e&s;teem or national
<PB N="460" REF="520">
prejudice, proceeded with his u&s;ual precipitation to new changes. In the mean time a mo&s;t dangerous con&s;piracy was forming again&s;t him. The cruel puni&s;hments inflicted in Ru&s;&s;ia on &s;tate criminals, have only an effect to harden the minds of men already fierce and obdurate, and &s;eldom deter them from the mo&s;t de&s;perate undertakings. Ro&s;amou&s;ki, Hetman or chief of the Co&s;&s;acks, a per&s;on of importance by that command, Panin, governor of the grand duke Paul, mar&s;hal Butterlin, the chamberlain Teplow, the attorney general Glebow, baron Orlow major of the guards, and many others of the great officers and fir&s;t nobility of the Empire, engaged in a con&s;piracy to dethrone the czar, who was now univer&s;ally hated; and, what was more fatal to him, univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves that their actions could not be di&s;agreeable to the empre&s;s; who&s;e conduct had always been the very rever&s;e of that of her con&s;ort, This prince&s;s find|ing that the affections of her hu&s;band were irrecoverably alienated, endeavoured to &s;et up a &s;eparate and indepen|dent intere&s;t in her own favour, and for a&s;&s;erting the rights of her &s;on. She therefore a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated the affec|tions of the Ru&s;&s;ian nation, and paid a re&s;pect to their man|ners and religion, in the &s;ame degree that her hu&s;band &s;eemed to cotemn them.</P>
<P>So ill was the czar &s;erved, that this con&s;piracy was grown general, without his receiving the lea&s;t notice of it, and he remained in perfect &s;ecurity, whil&s;t the &s;enate and the clergy were a&s;&s;embled to pa&s;s the &s;entence of his di&s;po&s;ition.

 <MILESTONE N="June 28."> 

 At this time the empre&s;s and he were both ab&s;ent from the capital at different country &s;eats. The empre&s;s, as &s;oon as &s;he found that the de&s;ign was declar|ed, got on hor&s;e-back, and with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed arrived at Peter&s;burg. She immediately harangued the guards, who chearfully and unanimou&s;ly declared in her favour, and pro|claimed her empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia independently of her hu&s;band. She then addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the clergy, and the chief of the nobility, who applauded her re&s;olution; and all orders im|mediately took the oath of allegiance to her as &s;ole empre&s;s. She was no &s;ooner acknowledged in this manner, than, without lo&s;ing a moment's time, &s;he marched from Peter&s;|burg towards the emperor at the head of a body of troops.</P>
<P>This prince was indulging him&s;elf in indolent amu&s;e|ments, and lulled in the mo&s;t profound &s;ecurity at a hou&s;e
<PB N="461" REF="521">
of plea&s;ure, called Oraniebaum on the &s;ea &s;hore, when a &s;oldier brought him an account that his kingdom was taken away from him.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed, and wholly unprepared for this event, he was &s;ome time &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and entirely at a lo&s;s what part to take. When he was rouzed from this trance by the approaching danger, his fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion was to defend the place with his Hol&s;tein guards; but tho' &s;atisfied of their attachment, he doubted their &s;trength, and he knew it was in vain to hope for any effort in his favour from the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Nothing then remained but flight, by which he might e&s;cape to Hol&s;tein, and wait &s;ome favourable turn of fortune. This late lord of powerful fleets and armies embarked in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and with a few attendants, rowed towards Cron&s;tadt; but he had not proceeded very far, when he was informed that this fortre&s;s was in the hands of his ene|mies, and that every avenue for e&s;cape was &s;hut again&s;t him. Dejected and de&s;ponding he returned to Oraniebaum. Af|ter &s;ome &s;hort and tumultuous deliberation, he re&s;olved to abandon all thoughts of defence, and to throw him&s;elf on the compa&s;&s;ion of the empre&s;s.</P>
<P>On her march &s;he met his me&s;&s;engers, who brought let|ters containing a renunciation of the empire, and &s;tipulating no other terms than leave to return to Hol&s;tein, and the &s;atisfaction of taking with him, as the companion of his re|treat, the counte&s;s of Woronzoff and one &s;ingle friend.</P>
<P>Rea&s;ons of &s;tate could not permit the empre&s;s to con&s;ent to the fir&s;t of tho&s;e terms, and the la&s;t could not be very flattering to her. His terms were rejected; and he was re|quired to &s;ign an unconditional re&s;ignation of his crown, ac|cording to a form that was prepared for him. Not &s;atisfied with depriving him of his crown, it was thought fit to make him the murderer of his own reputation; and this unfortu|nate prince, moved with the vain hope of life, &s;igned a paper declaring his conviction of his inability to govern the empire, either as a &s;overeign, or in any other capacity, and his &s;en&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;s, in which his continuing at the head of affairs would inevitably involve it. After he had &s;igned this abdi|cation, he gave up his &s;word, and was conducted to pri&s;on, where in a &s;hort time,

 <MILESTONE N="July 6."> 

 but according to what had been univer&s;ally expected, he died. The di&s;order, which killed him, was called an hemorrhoidal cholic.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="522">Thus was a revolution of &s;uch immen&s;e importance effect|ed in a &s;ingle day, and without &s;hedding a &s;ingle drop of blood. The unfortunate emperor enjoyed the power, of which he had made &s;o imprudent and unpolitic an u&s;e, no longer than &s;ix months. His wife, without any hereditary title, is &s;overeign mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire; and the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power on earth, is now held by an elective monarch.</P>
<P>Immediately on this revolution a number of manife&s;toes appeared, in which the conduct of the late czar was &s;e|verely condemned, the weakne&s;s of his per&s;onal character expo&s;ed, and de&s;igns of the blacke&s;t kind, even that of mur|dering his con&s;ort, attributed to him. Tho&s;e manife&s;toes at the &s;ame time were filled with the &s;tronge&s;t declarations of affection from the empre&s;s to the &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia, of re|gard to their intere&s;ts, and of attachment to their religion; and they are all filled with &s;uch unaffected and fervent &s;trains of piety, as mu&s;t needs prove extremely edifying to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the &s;entiments of pure religion, by which great princes are generally animated on occa&s;ions of this nature.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more able than the conduct of the em|pre&s;s, &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. In almo&s;t all re|&s;pects it was the very rever&s;e of that of her hu&s;band. She di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all foreigners from her confidence and &s;ervice; &s;he &s;ent away the Hol&s;tein guards, and cho&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian, who&s;e antient uniform was revived with lu&s;tre, the empre&s;s her|&s;elf frequently conde&s;cending to appear in it. The clergy were re&s;tored to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their beards. She conferred all the great po&s;ts of the empire on native Ru&s;&s;i|ans, and entirely threw her&s;elf on the affections of that peo|ple to whom &s;he owed her elevation.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS great change in the government of Ru&s;&s;ia, it was univer&s;ally feared, would be followed by a total change of &s;y&s;tem with regard to foreign affairs. The peace and alliance with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia were very unpopular mea&s;ures in Mu&s;covy. It was not probable that the clo&s;e and intimate connection which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and the late czar, could greatly recommend him to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or. And as it was imagined that this re|volution mu&s;t have been in a great degree owing to the machinations of tho&s;e courts, whom the czar had irritated by withdrawing from their alliance, there was the greater rea&s;on to apprehend that the power, which was now &s;et up, would be exerted in their favour.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o great advantages on the &s;ide of Ru&s;&s;ia, if the empre&s;s &s;hould not hold the peace concluded by her late hu&s;band to be binding on her, as none of the conque&s;ts were at this time evacuated. Every thing &s;eemed to con|&s;pire towards plunging the king of Pru&s;&s;ia into the aby&s;s of his former di&s;tre&s;&s;es, after he had emerged from them, on|ly for &s;uch a time, and in &s;uch a manner, as to make them more bitter and in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, for this wonderful man, the em|pre&s;s, who had come to the Ru&s;&s;ian throne in the extraor|dinary manner that we have &s;een, could not look upon her|&s;elf as &s;ufficiently &s;ecure to undertake again a war of &s;o much importance as that which had been ju&s;t concluded. It was nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, that &s;he &s;hould confine her attention &s;olely to her own &s;afety. Therefore it was
<PB N="464" REF="524">
expedient to collect, within it&s;elf, all the force of the em|pire, in order to oppo&s;e it to the de&s;igns of the many mal|contents, with which that empire always abounds, and who, though not attached to the intere&s;t of the late czar, and little inclined to revenge his fate, would find now both inducement and opportunity for rai&s;ing troubles and at|tempting new changes. Very plau&s;ible pretences for &s;uch attempts exi&s;ted from the time of Peter the Great; who, whil&s;t he improved and &s;trengthened his kingdom, left in it, at the &s;ame time, the &s;eeds of civil wars and revo|lutions.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, whatever her de&s;ires might be, induced the czarina to continue &s;o much of the &s;y&s;tem of her predece&s;&s;or, as coincided with her &s;ituation. She there|fore declared to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's mini&s;ters, "that &s;he was re&s;olved to ob&s;erve inviolably, in all points, the perpe|tual peace concluded under the preceding reign, that never|thele&s;s &s;he had thought proper to bring back to Ru&s;&s;ia, by the neare&s;t roads, all her troops in Sile&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Po|merania."</P>
<P>It was not the critical &s;ituation alone of the czarina which produced this moderation; the prudent behaviour of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, during the time of his connection with the late czar, had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in reconciling the mind of this empre&s;s to him, and of perpetuating &s;ome|thing like the &s;ame friend&s;hip, with intere&s;ts &s;o very differ|ent. The Ru&s;&s;ian &s;enate, flaming with re&s;entment again&s;t this monarch, and again&s;t their late &s;overeign; and the empre&s;s, full of &s;u&s;picion that the conduct of the latter might have been influenced by the councils of the former, &s;earched eagerly among&s;t the papers of the late emperor for elucidation or proofs of this point. They found indeed many letters from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; but in a &s;train ab&s;o|lutely different from what they apprehended. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had, as far as prudence would admit, kept a re&s;erve and di&s;tance in regard to the ra&s;h advances of this unhappy ally. Too experienced to be carried away by his incon&s;i|derate impetuo&s;ity, he gave him much &s;alutary, though fruitle&s;s, advice; he coun&s;elled him to undertake nothing again&s;t the empre&s;s his con&s;ort; to de&s;i&s;t from the war with Denmark; to attempt no changes in the religion and fundamental laws of the country; and not to think of com|ing into Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="525">On hearing the&s;e letters read, the empre&s;s is &s;aid to have bur&s;t into tears of gratitude, and made in con&s;equence the &s;tronge&s;t declarations in favour of this prince. They were not without effect. Orders had been given with relation to Pru&s;&s;ia, which threatened a renewal of ho&s;tilities. They were &s;oon &s;u&s;pended. The army of the Ru&s;&s;ians was in|deed &s;eparated from that of Pru&s;&s;ia; but all the important places, which the Ru&s;&s;ians had, with &s;o much blood&s;hed, and through &s;o many difficulties acquired, and which gave them the command of every thing el&s;e that remained to the king, were faithfully re&s;tored.</P>
<P>This change from a &s;trict alliance to a cold neutrality, though it made no &s;mall difference in the Pru&s;&s;ian affairs, yet, all things con&s;idered, mu&s;t be regarded as an e&s;cape, and as a deliverance almo&s;t as wonderful as his former. However, this circum&s;tance could not fail of in&s;piring &s;ome degree of confidence into his enemies, which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia endeavoured above all things to prevent.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of July&punc; the orders arrived at the allied camp from Peter&s;burg, for the Ru&s;&s;ians to &s;eparate them|&s;elves from his army, and return without delay to their own country. The king, without being confounded by this &s;udden order, and in&s;tead of &s;lackening his efforts on ac|count of this de&s;ertion, re&s;olved to fall with vigour, and without delay; upon mar&s;hal Daun, and to attack him be|fore the news of this change could reach him. Since he could no longer profit by the arms of the Ru&s;&s;ians, he en|deavoured to profit at lea&s;t by their appearance in his camp. The very next day therefore he attacked the Au&s;trian army, who&s;e right wing occupied the heights of Bucker&s;dorff; drove them from that eminence, and from &s;ome villages where they were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted. The &s;ucce&s;s was not owing only to the &s;pirit of the actual attack, but to an apprehen&s;ion of the Au&s;trians, that the whole united army of the Pru&s;&s;ians and Mu&s;covites was on the point of engag|ing them. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia made an u&s;e of tho&s;e allies, in the moment they de&s;erted him.</P>
<P>This lively attack was made with a lo&s;s only of three hundred men on the &s;ide of the Pru&s;&s;ians; the number of the Au&s;trians killed is not known. The pri&s;oners amount|ed to one thou&s;and; and fourteen pieces of cannon were taken. It was indeed no more than an affair of po&s;ts; but its con&s;equences were important; for the communication
<PB N="466" REF="526">
of the Imperiali&s;ts with Schweidnitz was now entirely and finally cut off; they could not attempt any thing con&s;ide|rable for the relief of that place. Prince Henry held them in continual alarm for Bohemia, and a great part of their attention, and no &s;mall part of their forces were kept con|tinually engaged upon that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia having thus pu&s;hed back mar&s;hal Daun, inve&s;ted Schweidnitz, and laid &s;iege to that impor|tant fortre&s;s before his face. This was the fourth time which that place had been be&s;ieged &s;ince the beginning of this war; and this circum&s;tance alone might &s;uffice to &s;hew the many and extraordinary changes of fortune which di&s;|tingui&s;hed the&s;e campaigns. We apprehend no in&s;tance has happened before of any place like this of real &s;trength being &s;o often &s;ucce&s;&s;ively taken and retaken in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle war.</P>
<P>As Schweidnitz is the key of Sile&s;ia, and, though not quite a regular place, is notwith&s;tanding well &s;ituated and well fortified; as the garri&s;on amounted to nine thou&s;and men, commanded by a good officer, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a very experienced engineer, and as two great armies of the ene|my ob&s;erved all his motions, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make the di&s;po&s;itions for the &s;iege with uncommon care. His infant|ry were encamped on the heights behind Schweidnitz. His cavalry formed a chain in the plains of Keintzerdorf, to be nearer the camp of the prince of Wirtemberg, which was &s;ituated &s;o as to prevent any enterprize from the county of Glatz. The prince of Bevern commanded a &s;trong corps, which po&s;ted it&s;elf advantageou&s;ly near Co&s;el. One under general Werner did the &s;ame at Noi&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>By the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions the Pru&s;&s;ian convoys were protect|ed, the principal places in Sile&s;ia guarded, the &s;iege of Sch|weidnitz covered, and an ea&s;y communication pre&s;erved be|tween all the detached corps employed in the&s;e &s;everal &s;er|vices.</P>
<P>The effects of this wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition were &s;oon felt. Mar|&s;hal Daun, de&s;pairing to &s;ucceed again&s;t the army, which, under the king in per&s;on, covered the &s;iege of Schweidnitz, endeavoured to break this chain, and by that means di&s;tre&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ians who were carrying on the &s;iege. Laudohn was therefore detached, with a very &s;uperior force, to at|tack the prince of Bevern, and to drive him from the ad|vantageous po&s;t he occupied. This attack was made with
<PB N="467" REF="527">
all the celerity and re&s;olution, which di&s;tingui&s;h the opera|tions of this brave officer. But the prince, mindful of the di&s;grace he had formerly &s;uffered in this province, oppo&s;ed him with &s;uch con&s;tancy and per&s;everance, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had time to come to his relief. The Au&s;trians were then put between two fires, routed, and pur&s;ued with a ter|rible &s;laughter.</P>
<P>This attempt being defeated, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia met with no di&s;turbance in his preparations for the &s;iege, and the trenches were opened on the night of the 8th of July.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was making this advantageous u&s;e of his fortune, the armies of the French and the allies in We&s;tphalia were not inactive. Among the commanders of the former a great di&s;union had long prevailed. The mar&s;hals de Broglio and de Soubi&s;e had mutually accu&s;ed each other; the camp and the court were for &s;ome time entirely di&s;tracted with the cabals of the partizans of the&s;e officers. The re&s;ult was not favourable to mar&s;hal Broglio. In him the French court was obliged to recal, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to di&s;grace, one of the very be&s;t of their officers. A &s;u&s;picion, and that not weakly founded, prevailed again&s;t this general, that unable to bear a competitor in fame, or an a&s;&s;ociate in command, he had often, in order to di&s;grace tho&s;e with whom he was to act, neglected to improve his favourable opportunities; and that in &s;ome in&s;tances, by his conduct, he had purpo&s;ely occa&s;ioned &s;ome failures, and even defeats. This was a fault which no great qualities in an officer could compen&s;ate, He was therefore removed from his command, and the conduct of the army left to the prince de Soubi&s;e, who was infinitely beloved by the &s;ol|diers for his generous and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition; and mar|&s;hal d'Etrees, who has been &s;o often mentioned in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, was a&s;&s;ociated with him.</P>
<P>The plan of the campaign, on the part of the French, did not differ much from that which had been formerly pur&s;ued. They had, as before, two armies; this under the prince de Soubi&s;e and mar&s;hal d'Etrees on the We&s;er, and another under the prince de Conde on the Lower Rhine.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the allies was al&s;o but little varied. The hereditary prince was po&s;ted in the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter, to watch the latter of the&s;e armies; and prince Ferdinand in per&s;on, with the body of the army, lay behind the Dymel to make head again&s;t the former. So little had the French
<PB N="468" REF="528">
profited by their &s;uperior numbers, and &s;uperior re&s;ources in this continental war, and &s;o little deci&s;ive u&s;e had they made even of &s;ome advantages in the field, that this cam|paign commenced very nearly in the &s;ame place, and they contended for pretty much the &s;ame objects, which they had &s;truggled for in the two preceding years.</P>
<P>So &s;uperior was the genius of prince Ferdinand, that un|der many di&s;advantages he was the fir&s;t to commence offen|&s;ive operations. The &s;troke he &s;truck on this occa&s;ion would &s;uffice alone to rank him with the fir&s;t commanders of his age. His abilities throughout the war have never &s;hone out with more lu&s;tre than in this campaign, which con|cluded it.</P>
<P>The French army was mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, both for command of the country, and for &s;trength, near a place called Graeben&s;tein, in the frontiers of He&s;&s;e; their center occupied an advantageous eminence; their left wing was almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by &s;everal deep ravines, and their right was covered by the village of Graeben&s;tein, by &s;everal ri|vulets, and a &s;trong detached body under one of their be&s;t officers, mon&s;ieur de Ca&s;tries.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation they imagined they had nothing to fear from the attempts of prince Ferdinand, who&s;e army, be|&s;ides the inferiority of its numbers, was &s;eparated in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch di&s;tant places, that they judged it im|po&s;&s;ible it could unite in any attack upon their camp. But whil&s;t they enjoyed them&s;elves in full &s;ecurity, the &s;torm was preparing to fall upon them from all quarters.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable corps of the allied army, under general Luckner, was po&s;ted to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, near E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbecke, on the Leine. He lay there to ob&s;erve prince Xavier of Saxony, who was encamped between the Werra and Gottingen. But if he watched the prince, the prince al&s;o watched him. When, therefore, he had orders to quit this po&s;t, that he might co-operate in the grand de&s;ign, he left a &s;mall party of his corps in his &s;tation, by which he deceived the prince of Saxony; and marching in the night with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, he cro&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, turned the right of the French army, and, without being di&s;covered, placed him&s;elf upon their rear. General Sporcken at the &s;ame time placed him&s;elf &s;o as to attack the &s;ame wing in flank. Prince Ferdinand cro&s;&s;ed the Dymel, in order to
<PB N="469" REF="529">
fall upon their center. The attack on the enemy's left was commanded by lord Granby.</P>
<P>The&s;e preparations were made with &s;o much judgment, celerity, and good order, that the French had not perceiv|ed the approach of the allies, when they found them&s;elves attacked with infinite impetuo&s;ity in front, flank, and rear.

 <MILESTONE N="June 24."> 

 The battle was &s;carcely begun, when they thought of nothing but flight. The corps under moun&s;ieur de Ca&s;tries had time to retreat in to|lerable order, and without any great lo&s;s. But it did not fare &s;o well with their center, and their left, which were oppo&s;ed by the calm re&s;olution of prince Ferdinand, and the generous courage of Granby.</P>
<P>As the French placed all their hopes rather in retreat than combat, an entire rout mu&s;t have en&s;ued, if mon&s;ieur Stainville, who commanded on the left, had not thrown him&s;elf with the flower of the French infantry into a wood, which enabled him, at the expence of the be&s;t part of it, to cover the retreat of the army. Here this brave and accompli&s;h|ed officer made a re&s;olute &s;tand, and for a long time &s;u&s;tained the whole weight of the allies. His corps was a devoted &s;acrifice. All but two battalions were cut to pieces or made pri&s;oners. The other bodies, covered by this re&s;olute manoeuvre, made a &s;hift to cover them&s;eles under the cannon of Ca&s;|&s;el, or precipitately e&s;caped to the other &s;ide of the Fulda.</P>
<P>Thus did the French army, by the virtue of mon&s;ieur de Stainville, e&s;cape a total defeat; but the con&s;equences of the action were not recovered during the whole cam|paign. They lo&s;t much credit both in point of re&s;olution and general&s;hip. Their infantry, in this engagement, con|&s;i&s;ted of one hundred battalions, when that of the allies was compo&s;ed but of &s;ixty. The common men made pri&s;oners by the allies on this occa&s;ion were two thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and fifty, and no le&s;s than one hundred and &s;ixty-two officers were taken. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t but a few men killed, and no officer of rank but lieutenant-colonel Town&s;hend

who fell with great glory to him&s;elf, and to the regret of the whole army.</P>
<P>Every thing in the conduct of prince Ferdinand appears the effect of a well dige&s;ted plan; and one great action compleated always helps to di&s;clo&s;e a &s;eries of bold, ma&s;ter|ly, and connected de&s;igns.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the enemy was di&s;loged from their &s;trong po&s;t, u&s;e was made of this advantage (whil&s;t the French, under the hurry and confu&s;ion of their late misfortunes, were un|able to provide again&s;t unexpected accidents) to pu&s;h for|ward a body of the Engli&s;h under lord Granby and lord Fre|derick Cavendi&s;h. The French could &s;carcely imagine, that, whil&s;t they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o &s;trong a place as Ca&s;&s;el, and commanded an army &s;o &s;uperior in numbers to the allies, that, whil&s;t prince Ferdinand braved them in front, they &s;hould find one of his detachments upwards of thirty miles behind them. In this emergency, mon&s;ieur de Rochambeau perceiving their motions, ha&s;tily collected &s;ome brigades of infantry and cavalry at Hom|bourg,

 <MILESTONE N="July 6."> 

 to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the communicati|on of the grand army with Franckfort from being cut off. But they were charged with &s;o much vigour by the two engli&s;h commanders, that, though they defended them&s;elves with &s;pirit for &s;ome time, they were in the i&s;|&s;ue di&s;per&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. They were obliged to evacuate that tract of country. Fritzlar, Feltzberg, and Lohr; and almo&s;t all the important po&s;ts in the &s;outh part of He&s;&s;e were occupied by the allies. The communicati|on with Franckfort, from whence the French drew their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, was ab&s;olutely intercepted.</P>
<P>To the north of He&s;&s;e al&s;o the allies were not le&s;s active, nor le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful: they obliged prince Xavier, with his Saxon detachments, to abandon his advanced po&s;t on the Leine, and unite him&s;elf to the grand army. They got between him and Gottingen, by which the French garri&s;on there was left without &s;upport. This garri&s;on, &s;eeing its communication interrupted, blew up a part of the fortifica|tions, and attempted a retreat; but finding no avenue open, they were obliged to return in confu&s;ion. De&s;pair|ing of their ability to hold this important place, they thought them&s;elves happy, when at length, with much management and difficulty,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 16."> 

 they were able to eva|cuate it without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="531">Prince Xavier, after having, as we &s;aid before, quitted his advanced &s;ituation at Morungen in the territories of Ha|nover, united him&s;elf to the right of the principal army, which was po&s;ted to the ea&s;tward of the Fulda, not far from the place where that river forms an angle in its junction with the Werra.

General Waldhau&s;en, in the mean time, had &s;eized the village of Bonnevert, which enabled him to keep the garri&s;on of Munden in check, and gave him al&s;o an oportunity, whenever the occa&s;ion required it, of falling on the enemy's rear.</P>
<P>The bold pa&s;&s;age of the Fulda, and the judgment of the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;po&s;itions, in&s;ured the victory. Prince Xavier, for a good while, defended him&s;elf with an ob&s;tinate re&s;olu|tion; but finding his flank gained, he began to give way. In this In&s;tant Waldhau&s;en, who had hitherto only watch|ed the i&s;&s;ue of the engagement, threw in his hor&s;e upon the rear and compleated the defeat.</P>
<P>General Stainville, who occupied a &s;trong entrenched camp in the neighbourhood, &s;eeing the party of the prince of Saxony in danger of being totally cut to pieces, quitted his intrenchments with his whole army of ten thou&s;and men, and ha&s;tened to their relief. Prince Frederick of Brun&s;wick, attentive to this movement, with great quick|ne&s;s &s;eized this critical opportunity, entered their camp the moment they had left it, and entirely de&s;troyed all their works. In this action 1100 of the enemy were made pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>The French finding their communication de&s;troyed, their army &s;urrounded and harra&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, and without intermi&s;&s;ion, were neither able to advance with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, or to retreat with any hope of &s;afety. In this di&s;tre&s;s they had nothing left but to call their army from the Lower Rhine to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. No time was to be lo&s;t. Expre&s;s after expre&s;s was &s;ent to ha&s;ten them.

<P>In the mean time prince Ferdinand pre&s;&s;ed upon Soubi&s;e's army. Advantageou&s;ly as they were &s;ituated, he offered them battle for a whole day. Rather than ri&s;que an en|gagement they decamped in the night, and quitted, with|out an action, tho&s;e advantageous grounds called the heights of Mul&s;ingen, where they could not be attempted without the greate&s;t difficulty and hazard; and the quitting of which gave prince Ferdinand the mo&s;t important advantages over them.</P>
<P>Never were military operations pu&s;hed with more viva|city, whil&s;t the negotiation for peace was in great forward|ne&s;s. The two great contending courts had opened confe|rences, whil&s;t their armies were cutting one another in pie|ces: but prince Ferdinand on that account, rather &s;train|ed than &s;lackened his efforts. He knew that the negotiati|on for peace is always much forwarded by the opperations of the campaign, and that a &s;ucce&s;sful action often ha&s;tens the deci&s;ion of a conte&s;ted article. Perhaps too he was willing to &s;hew in England, that the nece&s;&s;ity of making peace ought not to be attributed to the circum&s;tances of that part of the war which had been committed to his care. People imagined they could di&s;cern &s;omething like coldne&s;s to|wards this great commander in the new Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and that he, on his &s;ide, &s;eemed rather to favour that party in England which was for prolonging the war.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE events of the war in Germany, though its object was not more intere&s;ting than that in Portugal, &s;eem to rank far before the actions of the latter in dignity and importance. They naturally occupy the fir&s;t place, and ju&s;tify a more minute detail in an hi&s;tory of military opera|tions. It is in Germany that the great efforts of all the great powers in Europe were made from the beginning.
<PB N="473" REF="533">
Here the mo&s;t con&s;iderable armies were maintained; here the great battles were fought; and on this theatre the great commanders gave a full &s;cope to their genius. Germany &s;eems, as it were, the natural &s;oil of ho&s;tility; but Portu|gal, which had long langui&s;hed in a tranquil ob&s;curity, could &s;carce furni&s;h out a faint image of war.</P>
<P>Of the &s;tate of the military in that country we have &s;po|ken in a preceeding chapter. The marine was not on a much more re&s;pectable footing. About &s;ix or &s;even &s;hips of the line, and a very few frigates, compo&s;ed all the naval force of Portugal that was fit for &s;ervice; of that Portugal which had formerly been one of the fir&s;t maritime powers in Europe. The fortifications in that kingdom had been al&s;o long neglected, and &s;carce any of them were in a con|dition to &s;u&s;tain a regular &s;iege.</P>
<P>Portugal, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome advantages; but they were only &s;uch as &s;he derived from her weakne&s;s. The ex|treme barrenne&s;s and poverty of the country, made it very difficult for an army, either of friends or enemies, to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in it. The badne&s;s of the roads, and the frequency and &s;teepne&s;s of the mountains, which occupy the greate&s;t part of that kingdom, made it no le&s;s difficult to advance with rapid marches, and to improve the advantages of the cam|paign with proper expedition. The nature of the country al&s;o rendered it not unfit for that &s;pecies of defence, which the be&s;t force it had was be&s;t qualified to make; that is, in the way of an irregular war, by its armed pea&s;antry; for the defiles in many places are of &s;uch a nature, as to be capa|ble of being maintained by a &s;mall and undi&s;ciplined body, again&s;t very numerous and very regular forces. And the Portugue&s;e, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, were animated with &s;uch a &s;incere and inveterate hatred to the Spani&s;h name, and were filled with &s;o much terror at the pro&s;pect of falling a &s;econd time under the government of that nati|on, that great hopes were entertained of their exerting them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t on this occa&s;ion, and of their rou|&s;ing that natural courage in which the Portugue&s;e are not deficient.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages, however, did by no means balance the dangers to which that kingdom was expo&s;ed, from the joint ho&s;tility of France and Spain. All the hope of Por|tugal was centered in England, for who&s;e &s;ake, and in who&s;e quarrel &s;he had been drawn into this unequal conte&s;t. The
<PB N="474" REF="534">
greater the weakne&s;s of Portugal was, the more con&s;picu|ous were the magnanimity and re&s;ources of Great Britain, who made in the clo&s;e of &s;o expen&s;ive and ruinous a war, &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing efforts and who was in a condition by her &s;trength to prop up, at lea&s;t for a time, &s;o very feeble a &s;y&s;|tem. She &s;ent to Portugal, officers, troops, artillery, arms, military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and money, every thing which could enable the Portugue&s;e to exert their natural &s;trength, and every thing which could &s;upply that &s;trength where it was deficient.</P>
<P>When the Bourbon courts made war again&s;t Portugal, the declared object was to prevent Great Britain from the military and commercial u&s;e of the ports of that kingdom. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to attain this object by naval operati|ons, they attempted it by military ones, and aimed their principal endeavours at the two great ports, to which the Engli&s;h principally re&s;ort, Oporto and Li&s;bon. The po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e two objects would probably have fini&s;hed the war in their favour; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either of them would have given them the mo&s;t deci&s;ive advantages in it.</P>
<P>With this view three inroads were to be made, one to the north, another was propo&s;ed more to the &s;outh, whil&s;t the third was made in the middle provinces, in order to &s;u&s;tain the&s;e two bodies, and pre&s;erve the communication between them. The reader mu&s;t con&s;ider this as what ap|pears from their de&s;igns, and from the &s;teps they took to exe|cute them to have been their general plan; not that it was ever perfectly executed in all its parts, or at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t body which commenced ho&s;tilities was com|manded by the marquis de Sarria. This army entered into the north ea&s;t angle of Portugal, and marched towards Miranda. This town, though in no good &s;tate of defence, might have delayed them in their progre&s;s; but a powder magazine having blown up by accident, the fortifications were ruined, and the Spaniards, before they had rai&s;ed their fir&s;t battery,

 <MILESTONE N="May 9."> 

 marched into the town by the breaches in the wall.</P>
<P>Animated by this ea&s;y and fortunate &s;ucce&s;s, they pro|ceeded to Braganza, a con&s;iderable city, from whence the royal family of Portugal derived its ducal titles. This town made no greater defence than Miranda. From thence a detachment marched to Moncorvo,

 <MILESTONE N="May 15."> 

 which was &s;urrendered in the like manner; and
<PB N="475" REF="535">
every thing was cleared before them to the banks of the Douro. A party under count O'Reilly made a forced march of fourteen leagues, in two days,

 <MILESTONE N="May 24."> 

 to the city of Chaves, which was immediately evacuated. By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es they became ma&s;ters of al|mo&s;t the whole of the exten&s;ive province of Tralos Montes, and their progre&s;s &s;pread a general alarm. Oporto was al|mo&s;t given up as lo&s;t; and the admiralty of England prepa|red tran&s;ports to carry off the effects of the Briti&s;h factory. However, the body which had traver&s;ed this province with|out re&s;i&s;tance, attempting to cro&s;s the Douro, had its pro|gre&s;s checked on that &s;ide. The pea&s;ants, animated and guided by &s;ome Engli&s;h officers, and &s;eizing a difficult pa&s;s, repul&s;ed and drove them back to Torre de Moncorvo. They are &s;aid to have been guilty of &s;ome cruelties to the Spani&s;h pri&s;oners who fell into their hands. The&s;e cruelties were afterwards &s;everely retaliated upon them. The&s;e people, on both &s;ides naturally ferocious had not been &s;ufficiently inured to war, to moderate its fury, and reduce it under laws; they hated mutually, and they gave a full &s;cope to their hatred: they did not &s;ee each other as &s;oldiers, but as enemies.</P>
<P>The &s;econd body of the Spaniards, which we have men|tioned as the connective link between the two others, en|tered into the province of Beira, at the villages called Val de Mula and Valde Coelha. They were joined by &s;trong detachments, amounting to almo&s;t the whole army in Tra|los Montes, and immediately laid &s;iege to Almeida, which, though in no good order, was the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t provi|ded place upon the frontiers of Portugal. Be&s;ides, it was of the greate&s;t importance from its middle &s;ituation, as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would greatly facilitate the operations upon every &s;ide, and would e&s;pecially tend to forward an attempt upon Li&s;bon, which was the capital object, towards which, at this time, all the endeavours of the Spaniards &s;eem to have been directed.</P>
<P>Almedia was defended with &s;ufficient re&s;olution; but its fate was fore&s;een as &s;oon as it was attempted, there being no means of affording relief to any of the places be&s;ieged. It &s;urrendered however,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 25."> 

 upon terms honourable to the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of this place over&s;pread the whole ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iority of Ca&s;tle Branco, a

principal di&s;trict of the province of Beira, making their way to the &s;outhward, until they approached the banks of the Tagus. During the whole of their progre&s;s, and indeed during the whole campaign, the allied troops of Great Bri|tain and Portugal had nothing that could be called a body of an army in the field, and they could not think of oppo|&s;ing the enemy in a pitched battle. All that could be done was by the defence of pa&s;&s;es, by &s;kirmi&s;h, and by &s;ur|prize.</P>
<P>By this time the count of la Lippe Buckeburg had arri|ved in Portugal. Lord Tyrawly, who had been &s;ent, at the de&s;ire of the court of Li&s;bon, thither before the break|ing out of the war, being di&s;gu&s;ted by the behaviour of &s;ome per&s;ons at court, and much di&s;appointed in his expect|ations of the exertion they had promi&s;ed to make of their own force, and even of the u&s;e they had made of the &s;uc|cours from England, had been recalled very early in the campaign, and probably not contrary to his own incli|nation.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the joy which filled the whole nation at the arrival of &s;o celebrated an officer as the count la Lippe to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. More unanimity was now ex|pected, as the count had nothing to complain of, and came an entire &s;tranger to all the &s;ubjects of debate, which had hitherto exi&s;ted between the Briti&s;h general and the court of Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>That army, which we have mentioned as the third corps de&s;tined for the inva&s;ion of Portugal, a&s;&s;embled on the frontiers of E&s;tremadura, with an intention of penetrating into the province of Alentejo. Had this third body been joined to the others already in Portugal, it would probably have formed &s;uch an army as might, in &s;pight of any ob|&s;truction, have forced its way to Li&s;bon: had it acted &s;e|parately, it might have greatly di&s;tracted the defence, &s;o as to enable &s;ome other body to penetrate to that city. It was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, their entrance into Portu|gal; &s;ince their mere entrance would have been almo&s;t equal, in its con&s;equences, to a victory on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>The count la Lippe, therefore formed a de&s;ign of at|tacking an advanced body of the Spaniards which lay on their frontiers, in a town called Valentia de Alcantara, as he heard that they had here ama&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable maga|zines.
<PB N="477" REF="537">
The conduct of this important enterprize was com|mitted to brigadier general Burgoyne.</P>
<P>This gallant and able officer, though at a di&s;tance of five days march, and in &s;pight of all the di&s;appointments and ob|&s;tructions to which &s;ervices of this kind are &s;o liable, when they cannot be executed immediately; yet effect|ed a complete &s;urprize on the town of Valentia de Alcantara; took the general,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 27."> 

 who was to have commanded in the intended inva&s;ion, one colonel, two captains, and &s;eventeen &s;ubaltern officers. One of the be&s;t regiments in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice was entirely de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Although they were di&s;appointed in their expectations of finding magagines in this place, the effect of this well-con|ducted enterprize was not lo&s;t. The taking of this general was probably the cau&s;e which prevented the Spaniards from entering into the province of Alentejo. This &s;eemed to have been for &s;ome time the de&s;tination not only of that particular body, but al&s;o the great object of the Spani&s;h army, which had hitherto acted in Beira. The former of the&s;e provinces is a plain, open, fertile country, where their cavalry, in which con&s;i&s;ted the chief of their army, and in which lay their mo&s;t marked &s;uperiority, might have acted, and acted deci&s;ively; whereas the latter was a rough moun|tainous region, in which the hor&s;e were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with dif|ficulty, and could be of little &s;ervice. To prevent, there|fore, the entry of the Bourbon army from any quarter, into Alentejo, &s;eemed to be the great and &s;ingle object of the campaign on our &s;ide. General Burgoyne, by his expedi|tion into the Spani&s;h territories, had already prevented it on one part; and the vigilance and activity of the &s;ame officer had no &s;mall &s;hare in preventing it al&s;o on the other.</P>
<P>That part of the Bourbon army, which acted in the ter|ritory of Ca&s;tel Branco, had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;everal important pa&s;&s;es, which they obliged &s;ome bodies of the Portugue&s;e to abandon. They attacked the rear of the combined army, which was pa&s;&s;ing the river Alveito, with the appearance of a retreat; but, in reality, with a view to draw them in&s;en&s;ibly into the mountainous tracts: here they were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s; but &s;till they continued ma&s;ters of the country; and nothing remained but the pa&s;&s;age of the Tagus, to enable them to take up their quarters in Alentejo.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="538">Burgoyne, who was po&s;ted with an intention to ob&s;truct them in their pa&s;&s;age, lay in the neighbourhood, and with|in view of a detached camp, compo&s;ed of a con&s;iderable body of the enemy's cavalry, which lay near a village cal|led Villa Velha. As he ob&s;erved that the enemy kept no very &s;oldiery guard in this po&s;t, and were uncovered both on their rear and their flanks, he conceived a de&s;ign of fal|ing on them by &s;urprize. He confided the execution of this de&s;ign to colonel Lee, who turned their camp, fell upon their rear in the night,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 6."> 

 made a con&s;ider|able &s;laughter, di&s;per&s;ed the whole party, de&s;troy|ed their magazines, and returned with &s;carce any lo&s;s&punc; Burgoyne, in the mean time, &s;upported him by a feint at|tack in another quarter, which prevented the enemy's be|ing relieved from the adjacent po&s;ts.</P>
<P>This advantage, being obtained in a critical moment, was attended with important con&s;equences. The &s;ea&s;on was now far advanced; immen&s;e rains fell at this time; the roads were de&s;troyed; the country became impracticable; and the Spaniards, having &s;ei&s;ed no advanced po&s;ts in which they could maintain them&s;elves during the winter, and being e&s;|pecially unprovided with magazines for the &s;upport of their hor&s;e, every where fell back to the frontiers of Spain, where their &s;upplies were at hand, and where they were not liable to be harra&s;&s;ed by the efforts of the combined army.</P>
<P>In this manner Portugal was &s;aved, at lea&s;t for that cam|paign, by the wi&s;e conduct of count la Lippe, and the di&s;|tingui&s;hed valour of the Engli&s;h commanders and &s;oldiery: all that was wanting towards their deliverance was accom|pli&s;hed by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h army in more di&s;tant quarters, and by the peace, in which &s;o valuable and &s;o ex|po&s;ed an ally was not neglected. There never was proba|bly &s;o heavy a &s;torm of national calamity, ready to fall upon an unprovided people, &s;o happily averted, or &s;o &s;peedily blown over. Every thing, at the beginning of this cam|paign, bore the mo&s;t louring and ominous a&s;pect to the af|fairs of Great Britain. As it advanced, the &s;ky continu|ally cleared up; and the fortune of no nation, towards the clo&s;e of it, was enlivened with a more brilliant and more unclouded pro&s;perity. We &s;hall now proceed in the rela|tion of tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and of the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms in other parts of the world, where new &s;cenes of dan|ger and honour were now opened to them.</P>

St. Pierre and the whole i&s;land capitulate. St. Lucie, Gre|nades, and St. Vincent taken. Preparations for war again&s;t the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TOwards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t year, it was determined to re&s;ume the &s;cheme of operations in the We&s;t In|dies; where nothing had been attempted &s;ince the year 1759. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as the French trade to their i&s;lands had been, it &s;till continued a re&s;ource to that nation. On the other hand, nothing could po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h us with places of more importance, either to retain, or to exchange upon a peace, than our &s;ucce&s;s in this part of the world. Ano|ther con&s;ideration had probably no &s;mall &s;hare in directing our arms towards that quarter. From the time that the di&s;po&s;itions of Spain had become equivocal, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to take &s;uch &s;teps, as would put us in a re&s;pectable &s;ituation, in ca&s;e a war with that kingdom &s;hould become unavoidable. It was therefore very proper to have a &s;trong armament in the We&s;t Indies, that &s;ide on which Spain is mo&s;t vulnerable, and in which every wound affects a part of the quicke&s;t &s;en&s;ibility. Accordingly the force which was &s;ent into the We&s;t Indies on this occa&s;ion was very great; and, if we take the naval and military together, it was &s;uch an armament as had never been before &s;een in that part of the world. It was certainly very right to leave as lit|tle to hazard as po&s;&s;ible; and when, in the mo&s;t frugal me|thod of proceeding, a great many men mu&s;t have been employed, and a great deal of money &s;pent, it would have been an unpardonable error, from a con&s;ideration of almo&s;t any &s;aving, to have left any thing imperfect; e&s;pecially at a time, when the effect of every operation became almo&s;t hourly, more and more critical and deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>Every thing which had been an object of war in North America, was by tnis time completely acquired. It was therefore ea&s;y to draw a very con&s;iderable part of the army from thence. Eleven battalions were drawn from New York; a draught was al&s;o made from the garri&s;on of
<PB N="480" REF="540">
Bellei&s;le. The&s;e were reinforced by &s;ome troops which had been &s;cattered among the Leeward I&s;lands; &s;o that the whole land armament did not fall very &s;hort of twelve thou&s;and men. General Monckton, who had acquired &s;o much reputation in North America, and had received a very grievous wound at the taking of Quebec, command|ed the land forces in this expedition. The marine was under rear-admiral Rodney.</P>
<P>The failure in 1759 did not di&s;courage our admini&s;tra|tion from making Martinico the object of another attempt. The Engli&s;h fleet, after having rendezvouzed at Barba|does, came before this i&s;land on the 7th of January, 1762. The troops landed at a creek called <HI>Cas Navire</HI> without the lo&s;s of a man; the fleet having been di&s;po&s;ed &s;o pro|perly, and having directed their fire with &s;uch effect, that the enemy was obliged in a &s;hort time to abandon the bat|teries they had erected to defend this inlet.</P>
<P>When the landing was effected, the difficulties were far from being at an end. It is true, that neither the number nor the quality of the enemy's regular troops in the i&s;land were very formidable. But the militia was numerous, well armed, and not unqualified for &s;ervice in the only kind of war, which could be carried on in their country. Be&s;ides, the whole country was a natural fortification, from the number of ravines with rivulets between them, which lay from di&s;tance to di&s;tance. Wherever the&s;e grounds were practicable, the French had po&s;ted guards, and erected batteries. It is ea&s;y from hence to di&s;cern what ob&s;truc|tions the progre&s;s of an army was liable to, particularly with regard to its artillery. The&s;e ob&s;tructions were no where greater than in the neighbourhood of the place, again&s;t which the fir&s;t regular attack was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This town and citadel is overlooked and commanded by two very con&s;iderable eminences, called <HI>Morne Torten&s;on</HI> and <HI>Morne Garnier.</HI> Whil&s;t the enemy kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e eminences, it was impo&s;&s;ible to attack the town; if they lo&s;t them, it would prove impo&s;&s;ible to defend it. Suitable to the importance of tho&s;e &s;ituations were the mea&s;ures taken to render them impregnable. They were protected, like the other high grounds in this i&s;land, with very deep ravines; and this great natural &s;trength was im|proved by every contrivance of art. The <HI>Morne Torten&s;on</HI> was fir&s;t to be attacked. To favour this operation; a

body of regular troops and marines were ordered to ad|vance on the right along the &s;ea-&s;ide, towards the town, in order to take the redoubts which lay in the lower grounds. A thou&s;and &s;ailors in flat-bottomed boats, rowed clo&s;e to the &s;hore to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. On the left, towards the country, a corps of light infantry, properly &s;upported, was to get round the enemy's left; whil&s;t the attack in the centre was made by the Briti&s;h grenadiers and the body of the army, under the fire of batteries, which had been erected on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide with great labour and per&s;everance; the cannon having been dragged upwards of three miles by the &s;eamen.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;itions for the attack of this difficult po&s;t hav|ing been made with &s;o much judgment on the part of the commander, it was executed with equal &s;pirit and re&s;olu|tion by the &s;oldiery. The attack &s;ucceeded in every quar|ter. With irre&s;i&s;table impetuo&s;ity the enemy's works were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively carried. They were driven from po&s;t to po&s;t; until our troops, after a &s;harp &s;truggle, remained ma&s;ters of the whole Morne; &s;ome of the enemy fled precipitately into the town, to the very entrance of which they were pur&s;ued. Others &s;aved them&s;elves on the Morne Garnier, which was as &s;trong, and much higher than Morne Torten|&s;on, and overlooked and commanded it. Thus far had they proceeded with &s;ucce&s;s; but nothing deci&s;ive could be done, without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other eminence, our troops being much mole&s;ted by the enemy from that &s;upe|rior &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It was three days before proper di&s;po&s;itions could be made for driving them from this ground. Whil&s;t the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were making, the enemy's whole force de&s;cend|ed from the hill, &s;allied out of the town, and attacked the Engli&s;h in their advanced po&s;ts; but they were imme|diately repul&s;ed: and the ardour of the Briti&s;h troops hur|rying them forward, they improved a defen&s;ive advantage into an attack, pa&s;&s;ed the ravines, mingled with the enemy, &s;caled the hill, &s;eized the batteries, and po&s;ted them&s;elves on the &s;ummit of Morne Garnier. The French regular troops e&s;caped into the town. The militia di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves in the country.</P>
<P>All the &s;ituations which commanded the town and cita|del were now &s;ecured;

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to acquaint your lord&s;hip, that we left <HI>Barbadoes</HI> the 5th In&s;tant, anchored in <HI>St. Anne</HI>'s bay in this i&s;land the 7th, the &s;hips of war having &s;ilenced &s;ome batteries which the enemy had erected there, and where I was in hopes to have been able to have landed on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the bay, and to have cro&s;&s;ed over to Port Royal bay; but the difficulties that would have attended our being &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and &s;tores, added to the &s;carcity of fre&s;h water in that part, made me de&s;i&s;t. I then thought that if I could get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Pidgeon I&s;land,</HI> a &s;ecure anchorage might be had for the fleet and tran&s;ports in <HI>Port Royal</HI> harbour. For this purpo&s;e, I detached two brigades of the army, under the command of brigadiers <HI>Haviland</HI> and <HI>Grant,</HI> to <HI>Ance Darlet,</HI> where they landed, and marched to the ground oppo&s;ite to the i&s;land; but finding the road impa&s;&s;able for cannon, which were nece&s;&s;ary for the reduction of that i&s;land, I judged it be&s;t for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, to proceed (having previou&s;ly recon|noitred the &s;hore) and land near the <HI>Ca&s;e des Navires;</HI> which we effected on the 16th, without any mole&s;tation, the &s;hips of war having &s;ilenced the batteries above us. I had forgot, my lord, to mention, that with the above command, were the light infan|try under lieutenant colonel <HI>Scott,</HI> who were advanced the night the command remained there, and were attacked in the night by three companies of grenadiers, &s;ome free-booters, negroes and mulattoes, which the enemy had pa&s;&s;ed over from <HI>Fort Royal;</HI> but they were &s;o warmly received, that they retreated precipitately, leaving &s;ome dead; and a &s;erjeant and three of their grenadiers taken pri&s;oners, without any lo&s;s on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>We are now encamped upon the heights, above <HI>Ca&s;e des Na|vires;</HI> and I was in hopes, before this time, to have given your lord&s;hip more &s;atisfactory accounts of our operations. But the ravines or gullys we have to pa&s;s, are of &s;uch depth and difficulty of acce&s;s, and that in the face of many batteries and redoubts, with the whole country, as well mulattoes and negroes, as inha|bitants in arms, and without being able to procure any material intelligence, that I do not think it prudent to expo&s;e his maje&s;ty's troops until I can erect batteries to cover them, which we are at work upon with the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>However, my lord, I have the plea&s;ure to acquaint you, that the troops continue healthy, although they have been nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to laying on their arms, and are in the highe&s;t &s;pirits; and I don't in the lea&s;t doubt, but that I &s;hall be able to execute this principal object of his maje&s;ty's commands, of which I &s;hall give your lord&s;hip the earlie&s;t notice.</P>
<P>It gives me great plea&s;ure to acquaint your lord&s;hip, how much I am indebted to admiral <HI>Rodney,</HI> for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from the fleet under his command: the utmo&s;t harmony has &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted hitherto, and I am per&s;uaded will continue to do &s;o.</P>
<P>This will be delivered to your lord&s;hip by captain <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> who takes home the admiral's di&s;patches.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I De&s;ire you will acquaint their lord&s;hips, that I arrived at <HI>Bar|badoes</HI> on the 22d of <HI>November,</HI> having parted company with the &s;quadron under my command in a hard gale of wind, a few days after we left the channel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Foudroyant, Mode&s;te,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ilisk,</HI> joined me the 27th, the <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Thunder</HI> the 1&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> and the <HI>Van|guard,</HI> with the remainder of the &s;quadron, on the 9th. The <HI>Temeraire,</HI> and <HI>Acteon,</HI> with the troops from <HI>Bellei&s;le,</HI> arrived the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> and major general <HI>Monckton,</HI> with the forces from <HI>North America,</HI> on the 24th; and having remained a few days to water the &s;hips, refre&s;h the men, and make nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|po&s;itions for our enterprize, we arrived off <HI>Martinico</HI> the 7th of <HI>January;</HI> and on the 8th we all anchored in <HI>St. Anne</HI>'s bay; the &s;hips I had appointed (under Sir <HI>James Douglas</HI>) having &s;ilenced the forts of that coa&s;t; in performing of which, we had the misfortune to lo&s;e the <HI>Rai&s;onable,</HI> as &s;he was leading in for one of the enemy's batteries, owing to the pilot's being ignorant of a little reef of rocks which took her up. We have &s;aved all her people, all her &s;tores, and I hope &s;oon to get all her guns.</P>
<P>Having by the motion of the fleet and army, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an excellent harbour, and &s;ecured a landing on the weather-mo&s;t part of the i&s;land, which might be made tenable at any time, as likewi&s;e thereby greatly alarming the enemy.</P>
<P>At general Monckton's reque&s;t, I di&s;patched commodore <HI>Swan|ton,</HI> with a &s;quadron of &s;hips, and two brigades, to the bay of <HI>Petite A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce,</HI> in order to take po&s;t there. Captain <HI>Hervey</HI> of the <HI>Dragon</HI> having &s;ilenced the battery of the <HI>Grand Ance,</HI> landed his marines and &s;eamen, who attacked it al&s;o from the &s;hore, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort; and, on the 14th, I followed with the whole fleet and army, after de&s;troying the enemy's batteries at St. <HI>Anne</HI>'s bay, when (having reconnoitred the coa&s;t with the ge|neral) we came to a re&s;olution, to make an attempt between <HI>Point Negroe</HI> and the <HI>Cas de Pilotte,</HI> which I ordered to be attacked on the 16th; and having very &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and with little lo&s;s &s;ilenced the batteries, I landed general <HI>Monckton</HI> with the greate&s;t part of his forces by &s;un-&s;et; and the whole army was on &s;hore a little after day-light next morning, without the lo&s;s of a man (the boats being commanded by commodore <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wanton</HI> in the centre, capt. <HI>Shuldoam</HI> on the right wing, and capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> on the left) with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they were mo&s;t immediately in want of, and had all the &s;hips and tran&s;ports anchored as much in &s;afety, as this coa&s;t will a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mit.</P>
<P>I al&s;o landed two battalions of marines, con&s;i&s;ting of 450 men each.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the honour of writing to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord&s;hip the 20th of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nu|ary,</HI> when I acquainted you that I intended to attack the ene|my in the &s;trong po&s;ts they occupied on the oppo&s;ite heights, and the <HI>Morne Tarten&s;on,</HI> leading to <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> as &s;oon as I had erect|ed batteries (which were thought nece&s;&s;ary) to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the pa&s;&s;ing a very deep and wide ravine

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A large hollow made between two hills, occa&s;ioned by a &s;udden current of water, which is very frequent and rapid at the time of the Equinox. It is of a con&s;iderable depth, and not le&s;s difficult to get into than to a&s;cend as it is tufted with trees, bru&s;h-wood on every &s;ide, and in many places covered over. The&s;e the French lined with in|fantry; but our forces re&s;olute, and determined to carry the batteries on the other &s;ide, let each other down fir&s;t &s;linging thelr muskets; when they got to the other &s;ide, clambered up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, formed, and carried all before them.

, or gully, which &s;eperated us from them.</P>
<P>My di&s;po&s;ition for the attack being made on the 24th of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> at break of day the troops advanced under a bri&s;k fire of our batteries. The grenadiers under brigadier <HI>Grant</HI> fir&s;t falling in with the enemy's advanced po&s;ts, began the attack: brigadier <HI>Rufane</HI> on the right, with his brigade, and the marines, was to advance and attack the redoubts along the coa&s;t; 1000 &s;eamen in the flat-bottomed boats, rowed us as he advanced: Lord <HI>Rollo</HI>'s brigade &s;upported the grenadiers: Brigadier <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> with his bri|gade, (&s;upporting the light infantry under lieutenant colonel <HI>Scott</HI>) to attack the left of a plantation, and to endeavour to get round the enemy. The light infantry effected their attempt, and while the grenadiers were driving the enemy from po&s;t to po&s;t, they got upon their left, which helped to complete the event of the day. The enemy's works were now &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attacked with the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity, &s;o that at nine o'clock we were in the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their works, and the &s;trong ground of <HI>Morne Tarten&s;on,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of many redoubts mounted with can|non, and advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated to a&s;&s;i&s;t the natural &s;trength of the country. The enemy retired in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, to the town of <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> and to <HI>Morne Garnier</HI> (a &s;till higher hill than the <HI>Morne Tarten&s;on,</HI> and &s;eperated from it by a deep ravine, co|vered with a very thick bru&s;h, and a rivulet at the bottom) from whence they thought they were never to be di&s;lodged, both from its natural &s;trength, and the works and batteries they had on it. The &s;pirit of the grenadiers in this attack was &s;uch, that &s;ome of them even pur&s;ued the enemy to the bridge of the town, and brought off pri&s;oners from thence.</P>
<P>While this was doing on this &s;ide, brigadier <HI>Haviland</HI> with his brigade, two battalions of <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and a corps of light in|fantry (which I had formed from the &s;everal regiments and given the command of to major <HI>Leland</HI>) had orders (from the reported practicability of the pa&s;&s;age) to cro&s;s the ravine a good deal to the left, and attack a body of the enemy who were po&s;ted on &s;everal heights oppo&s;ite to him, and to try to get into their left; and by that means divide their force. Yet, although they began their march at two o'clock in the morning &s;uch was the difficulty of acce&s;s, though I am convinced every means were tried, that it was late before they effected it.</P>
<P>When I found that the enemy were giving way on all &s;ides, I ordered lieutenant colonel <HI>Scott</HI>'s light infantry, brigadier <HI>Wal&s;h</HI>'s brigade, and a divi&s;ion of the grenadiers, to a plantation more to the left, where brigadier <HI>Haviland</HI> was to have come down: they drove off &s;ome of the enemy po&s;ted there; and the light in|fantry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a very advantageous po&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Morne Garnier.</HI> To &s;upport them, I ordered brigadier <HI>Havi|land</HI>'s corps (which now had pa&s;&s;ed) to their right: the divi&s;ion of grenadiers under brigadier Grant, and <HI>Wal&s;h</HI>'s brigade, kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the upper plantation, and communicated with <HI>Havi|land</HI>'s corps. The marines, which I had taken from brigadier <HI>Rufane,</HI> I po&s;ted to cover the road between the two plantations.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we began to erect batteries on <HI>Morne Tarten&s;on,</HI> again&s;t the citadel of <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> but were much annoyed on that, and the following day, by the enemy from <HI>Morne Garnier.</HI> Find|ing that it was ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ary to attack this place to the left, where the corps of light infantry, and brigadier <HI>Haviland</HI>'s bri|gade were po&s;ted, I determined immediately to errect batteries again&s;t the&s;e of the enemy which annoyed us, and which might al&s;o cover our pa&s;&s;age of the ravine.</P>
<P>On the 27th, about four o'clock in the evening, the enemy, under cover of their batteries, and with the greate&s;t part of their force, had the temerity to attack the two corps of light infantry, and brigadier <HI>Haviland</HI>'s brigade, in the po&s;ts they occupied; but were received with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s, that they were immedi|ately repul&s;ed; and &s;uch was the ardour of the troops, that they pa&s;&s;ed the ravine with the enemy, &s;eized their batteries, and took po&s;t there, being reinforced by brigadier <HI>Wal&s;h</HI>'s brigade, and the divi&s;ion of grenadiers under brigadier <HI>Grant,</HI> who immedi|ately on the attack had marched to &s;upport them. Night was now come on; but major <HI>Leland</HI> moving on to the left with his light infantry, and finding no oppo&s;ition, continued his rout to|wards the enemy's redoubts, which he &s;oon came up to, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy (except a few grenadiers, who were pri|&s;oners) having abandoned them. Their troops retired into the town and citadel, and the militia di&s;per&s;ed in the country. Briga|diers <HI>Wal&s;h, Grant</HI> and <HI>Haviland,</HI> immediately moved up to &s;up|port the light infantry: &s;o that at nine o'clock at night, his ma|je&s;ty's troops were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this very &s;trong po&s;t, which en|tirely commanded the citadel. So precipitate was the enemy's flight, that they left a mortar loaded, and 8 or 9 guns un&s;piked, with a quantity of ammunition and provi&s;ions. The cannon and mortar were turned again&s;t the citadel in the morning.</P>
<P>Having gained this advantageous po&s;t, from which the enemy had &s;o much annoyed us and having completed two batteries on <HI>Morne Tarten&s;on,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen guns and three mortars, we opened them on the 30th: but finding that the di&s;tance was too great, and having now <HI>Morne Capuchine</HI> in our power, not more than 400 yards di&s;tant from the fort, as well as the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the town, I immediately re&s;olved to erect batteries at both the&s;e places, the &s;ooner to reduce the citadel; but for the ea&s;ier conveyance of our cannon by water, I ordered major <HI>Leland,</HI> with his light infantry, to take po&s;t on the river <HI>mon&s;ieur.</HI></P>
<P>The enemy perceiving our de&s;igns, and for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, on the evening of the 3d in&s;tant, beat the cha|made; in con&s;equence of which, the gate of the citadel was de|livered up to his maje&s;ty's troops the evening of the 4th, and at nine o'clock next morning the garri&s;on marched out, on the terms of the capitulation. It con&s;i&s;ted of about 800 men, grenadiers, marines, militia, and free-booters. About 150 of the garri&s;on were killed and wounded in the &s;iege. The enemy might have kept us much longer, as it would have been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have made two or three breaches, which mu&s;t have taken &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In the &s;everal attacks, I am credibly informed, that the enemy had not le&s;s than 1000 men killed, wounded, and taken pri&s;oners: among the latter, &s;everal of their principal officers of the mi|litia, taken the 24th. Our lo&s;s your lord&s;hip will &s;ee by the re|turn. You have al&s;o my lord, a return of the artillery and &s;tores taken from the enemy on the 24th and 27th of January; and in the citadel at its &s;urrender on the 5th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I cannot find words, my lord, to render that ample ju&s;tice due to the true valour and per&s;evering ardour of his maje&s;ty's troops, which I have the honour to command. The difficulties they had to encounter in the attack of an enemy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every ad|vantage that art or nature could give them, were great. Their per&s;everance, in &s;urmounting the&s;e ob&s;tacles, furni&s;hes a noble example of Briti&s;h &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The brigadiers Haviland, Grant, Rufane, Lord Rollo, and Wal&s;h, and all the officers in general, de&s;erve the highe&s;t ap|plau&s;e for their animated and &s;oldierlike conduct.</P>
<P>The grenadiers of the army, in three divi&s;ions, headed by the lieutenant colonels Fletcher, Ma&s;&s;y, and Vaughan, and the light infantry and rangers, in three bodies, commanded by lieutenant colonel Scott, major Leland, and captain Kennedy, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, the warme&s;t part of the &s;ervice having fallen to their lot.</P>
<P>M. la Touche the governor general, after leaving a garri&s;on in <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> retired with the remains of his grenadiers, and is now, as I am informed, at <HI>St. Pierre.</HI> We have not as yet had the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence together, nor has he &s;o much as &s;ent to enquire after his killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Immediately upon the fort &s;urrendering, the admiral and I re|ceived a deputation from mo&s;t of the quarters of the i&s;land, de|&s;iring likewi&s;e to capitulate, M. La Touche having refu&s;ed them to enter into any terms. On the 7th in&s;tant we agreed upon the ca|pitulations, to which we have every day &s;ome of the other quar|ters of the i&s;land acceding. <HI>St. Pierre,</HI> and the neighbouring quar|ters, are the only ones which hold out, owing to the pre&s;ence of M. La Touche; but &s;hould they not come in, in a day or two, which I am told I may expect every hour, I purpo&s;e moving that way, and do not the lea&s;t doubt but that I &s;hall &s;oon reduce them to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the 7th in&s;tant, <HI>Pidgeon I&s;land,</HI> one of the defences of this harbour, &s;urrendered by &s;ummons on the &s;ame terms of the citadel, (cannon excepted.)</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip may look upon the capitulation for the i&s;land as fixed, the admiral and my&s;elf being re&s;olved not to make the lea&s;t alteration. The other quarters mu&s;t accede to it.</P>
<P>We hope both the capitulations will receive his maje&s;ty's ap|probation, as it has been our earne&s;t &s;tudy to obtain, on our part, every advantage to the nation, that could accrue from the con|que&s;t of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The day after the affair of the 27th, learning from one of my parties that <HI>M. Nadau Deutruil,</HI> late the <HI>French</HI> governor of the i&s;land of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> was at a hou&s;e about two leagues from my quarters, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end, and bring him in, and he is now with me a pri&s;oner. I purpo&s;e &s;ending him to <HI>France</HI> by &s;ome opportunity that may offer hereafter. The <HI>French</HI> troops are all aboard, and will &s;oon &s;ail for <HI>France</HI> according to the capitulation.</P>
<P>I have given orders for the repair of the citadel, and for every nece&s;&s;ary work. The inhabitants, who had all quitted their hou&s;es, and retired to the heights, are now returning to them; and as &s;oon as I have fixed the inhabitants of St. <HI>Pierre,</HI> I &s;hall pur&s;ue the other parts of his maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat to your lord&s;hip the harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the fleet and army, and the cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance we have received from admiral <HI>Rodney,</HI> in every part of the operations where his aid could be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>This will be delivered to your lord&s;hip by major <HI>Gates,</HI> one of my aid-de-camps, who will inform your lord&s;hip of any particu|lars you may de&s;ire to know. I mu&s;t beg leave to recommend him to his maje&s;ty's favour, as a very de&s;erving officer, and who has now &s;erved upwards of twelve years in <HI>America</HI> with much credit.</P>

<P>The almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties the troops had to &s;trug|gle with, and the &s;urprizing &s;trength of the country, improved by all that art could add, will be be&s;t explained by general <HI>Monckton.</HI> But this I mu&s;t &s;ay, in ju&s;tice to tho&s;e I have the honour to com|mand, that the intrepidity and gallant behaviour of the officers and troops employed on this expedition, could be equalled only by the eager and chearful activity of the officers and &s;eamen; who contributed every thing in their power towards the reduction of the place, and made no difficulties in tran&s;porting numbers of the heavie&s;t mortars and &s;hips cannon, up the &s;teepe&s;t mountains, at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and acro&s;s the ene|my's line of fire.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to acquaint their lord&s;hips, that we have taken, in this port, fourteen of the enemy's be&s;t privateers; and many more which are in the other ports of the i&s;land, will be im|mediately delivered into my hands, agreeable to the capitulation of the inhabitants: and for all further particulars, I mu&s;t refer their lord&s;hips to captain <HI>Darby,</HI> who is charged with the&s;e di&s;|patches.</P>
<P>It gives me the &s;incere&s;t &s;atisfaction, that I can a&s;&s;ure their lord&s;hips, the mo&s;t perfect harmony has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the navy and army, each vying (in the mo&s;t friendly manner) which &s;hould &s;erve his maje&s;ty and their country be&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the honour of writing to your Lord&s;hip the 9th in&s;t. from <HI>Fort Royal</HI> which went by my aid-de-camp, major <HI>Gates,</HI> who &s;ailed from thence in his maje&s;ty's &s;hip <HI>Nightingale,</HI> on the 10th in&s;t. a duplicate of that letter I now inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when I was about to embark for the reduction of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s two deputies arrived at <HI>Fort Royal</HI> on the 12th in&s;t. offering terms of capitulation for the whole i&s;land, on the part of M. <HI>La Va&s;&s;or Delatouche,</HI> the Governor-General on the 13th. They received the Admiral's and my an&s;wers, to their propo&s;als, which they car|ried to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s; and on the 14th returned with the capitulation &s;igned. In con&s;equence of which, I left <HI>Fort Royal</HI> on the 15th, with the grenadiers of the army, and the 2d brigade; and on the following day took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this large and opulent town, with all the po&s;ts in the neighbourhood. The enemy marched out about 320 grenadiers, who are embarked, and will &s;ail immediately for <HI>France.</HI> M. <HI>Le Va&s;&s;or Delatouche,</HI> the Governor-General, M. <HI>Rouille,</HI> Lieutenant Governor, and the &s;taff will &s;hortly fol|low.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I &s;end your Lord&s;hip a copy of the capitulation for the i&s;land, which we humbly hope will meet with his Maje&s;ty's ap|probation. Commodore <HI>Swanton</HI> is now off the <HI>Grenades</HI> with a &s;quadron of men of war; and I propo&s;e &s;ending immediately Brig. Gen. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> with the 5th brigade, and the corps of light infantry under Lieut. Col. <HI>Scott,</HI> in order to reduce that and the other i&s;lands. I have undoubted intelligence, that the number of white men in the <HI>Grenades</HI> do not exceed 500; and in the other i&s;lands not quite &s;o many.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have proceeded upon this &s;ervice my&s;elf, had I not thought it of more con&s;equence, for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, my remaining here at this critical time, when, by what we can learn, a rupture with <HI>Spain</HI> may be daily expected; and here I am al&s;o at hand to &s;ettle many material affairs relative to the &s;ecurity of this conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed, I have good rea&s;on to believe, that Brig. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> will meet with very little ob&s;truction in his operations. However, &s;hould he not immediately &s;ucceed, I &s;hall move that way with a larger force, and make no doubt to compel them to a &s;peedy &s;ur|render.</P>
<P>It was not my intention to have &s;ent home an expre&s;s until I could have informed your Lord&s;hip of the reduction of the other i&s;lands mentioned in his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions.&mdash; But as this i&s;land is now completely reduced to his Maje&s;ty's obedience, I was apprehen&s;ive that a delay, in &s;ignifying this intere&s;ting event, might be attended with &s;ome bad con&s;equences at this critical juncture. I therefore &s;end this by my Aid-de-Camp. Captain <HI>Ricaut,</HI> who can inform your Lord&s;hip of any particulars you may de&s;ire to know; and I beg leave to recommend him to your Lord|&s;hip's countenance, as a very de&s;erving and good officer.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, immediately to fill &s;ome civil employments here, I have, accordingly, appointed proper per&s;ons to act until his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure be known.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has, herewith, a return of the artillery, and warlike &s;tores, found in the town, the <HI>Reduit,</HI> and the other dif|ferent po&s;ts.</P>

 was fortunately prevented by the arrival of depu|ties,
<PB N="490" REF="553">
who came to capitulate for the &s;urrender of that place, and of the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;urrender of Martinico, which was the &s;eat of the
<PB N="491" REF="554">
&s;uperior government, the principal mart of trade, and the centre of all the French force in the Caribbees, naturally drew on the &s;urrender of all the dependent i&s;lands. Gra|nada,
<PB N="492" REF="555">
a fertile i&s;land, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome good harbours, was given up without oppo&s;ition. St. Lucia, and St. Vin|cent, the right to which had &s;o long been objects of con|tention
<PB N="493" REF="556">
between the two nations, followed its example. The Engli&s;h were now the &s;ole and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all the Caribbees, and held that chain of innumerable i&s;lands which forms an immen&s;e bow, extending from the ea&s;tern point of Hi&s;paniola almo&s;t to the continent of South Ame|rica. And though &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands are barren, none of them very large, and not many of them well inhabited, they boa&s;t more trade than falls to the lot of many re&s;pect|able kingdoms.</P>
<P>The time, in which Martinico was reduced, was a cir|cum&s;tance of almo&s;t as much con&s;equence as the reduction it&s;elf; for the war again&s;t Spain having been declared in the beginning of the year, it became advi&s;eable to &s;trike early &s;uch an effective blow again&s;t that nation as might incline them to a &s;peedy peace, or might influence the fortune of the whole war, if, contrary to our wi&s;hes, the war &s;hould continue. It was, on this plan, nece&s;&s;ary to employ a very great force, and, of cour&s;e, to call away a very con|&s;iderable part of that which had been employed at Mar|tinico, whil&s;t the &s;ea&s;on permitted them to act.</P>
<P>When the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration determined to trans|fer the war into the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, with great judgment they fixed they eyes at once upon the capital object 

<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">As the merit of projecting this expedition has been variou&s;ly related, the following particulars may not be improperly given here. &mdash;Admiral Knowles on his return from Jamaica in <HI>1756,</HI> took an opportunity of vi&s;iting the Havanna, and in&s;pecting its fortifi|cations, of which he made plans, and other material ob&s;ervations; the&s;e at the reque&s;t of the duke of Gumberland, were laid before him for his in&s;pection, who knowing the merit of the admiral as an engineer, con&s;ulted him on the mo&s;t probable means of putting them into execution; the&s;e his royal highne&s;s formed into a regular plan for execution, which he &s;ent to the mini&s;try, who held them under con&s;ideration for &s;ome time; however, this plan was di&s;approved of by lord An&s;on, then fir&s;t lord of the Admiralty, who formed another, which was carried into execution; but as his royal high|ne&s;s had very early intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the expedition, the ap|pointing of a commander of the land-force was left to him, which naturally fell on the earl of Albemarle, whom he had in a manner tutored from his earlie&s;t years.</NOTE>

: and re&s;olved to commence their operations
<PB N="494" REF="557">
where others of le&s;s ability would have cho&s;en to conclude them. In an attack upon &s;ubordinate places, the conque&s;t would not have been much more certain; when obtained, it would be far from deci&s;ive; and a failure would have been fatal, as it would include a lo&s;s of reputation. The failure of an armament in a &s;ubordinate attack is a bad pre|parative for a greater attempt. The plan, therefore, of the war of 1740 in the Spani&s;h Indies, in which we began with Porto Bello, and &s;o proceeded to Carthagena, &amp;c. was mean, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;s in one of the&s;e attempts did nothing towards in&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s in the other; and if we had &s;ucceeded in both attempts, our advantage would have had but little influence on a third. But the plan of the war, ju&s;t now concluded, was great and ju&s;t; becau&s;e we began with the Havannah, in which the whole trade and navigation of the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies center, and without which it cannot be carried on. If we &s;hould ac|quie&s;ce in this conque&s;t, this conque&s;t alone would almo&s;t have fini&s;hed the war; becau&s;e it would have utterly in|tercepted the enemy's re&s;ources.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Commanders in the expedition again&s;t the Havannah. Fleet &s;ails from Port&s;mouth. Pa&s;&s;age through the old &s;treights of Bahama. Town and harbour of the Havannah de&s;cribed. Troops land.

The fort &s;tormed. Ope|rations again&s;t the town. The Havannah &s;urrenders. Ad|vantages of this acqui&s;ition.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT being determined to commence with this enterprize, &s;uch commanders were to be cho&s;en, as could be &s;afely intru&s;ted with the conduct of an undertaking &s;o weighty, and on the &s;ucce&s;s of which &s;o much depended. Lord Al|bemarle, the friend and di&s;ciple of the duke of Cumberland, commanded the land forces. Admiral Pococke, who having contributed by his valour towards that &s;overeignty which his country had obtained in the Ea&s;t Indies, was now cho&s;en to extend its empire and its honour in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth on the 5th of March, the day on which the Grenades were &s;urrendered. A fleet had &s;ailed from Martinico under the command of that &s;pirited and intelligent officer, Sir James Douglas, in order to rein|force them. The &s;quadrons very happily met, without de|lay or di&s;per&s;ion, at Cape Nichola, the north-we&s;t point of Hi&s;paniola, on the 27th of May. After this junction, the armament amounted to nineteen &s;hips of the line; eighteen &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of war; and near one hundred and fifty tran|&s;ports, which conveyed about ten thou&s;and land forces. A &s;upply of four thou&s;and had been ordered from New York, and was expected to join them very near as early as they could be &s;uppo&s;ed able to commence their operations.</P>
<P>There were two choices before the admiral for his cour&s;e to the Havannah. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious was the com|mon way, to keep to the &s;outh of Cuba, and fall into the track of the galleons. But this, though by much the &s;afe&s;t, would prove by far the mo&s;t tedious pa&s;&s;age; and delays, above all things were to be avoided, as the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole enterprize would probably depend upon its being in forwardne&s;s before the hurricane &s;ea&s;on came on. He there|fore
<PB N="496" REF="559">
re&s;olved to run along the northern &s;hore of that i&s;land, pur&s;uing his career from ea&s;t to we&s;t through a narrow pa&s;|&s;age, not le&s;s than &s;even hundred miles in length, called the old &s;treights of Bahama.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, through almo&s;t the whole of its extent, is bounded on the right and left by the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ands and &s;hoals, which render the navigation &s;o hazardous, that it has u&s;ually been avoided by &s;ingle and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. There was no pilot in the fleet who&s;e experience could be depended on to conduct them &s;afely through it. The ad|miral, however, determined on this pa&s;&s;age; and being pro|vided with a good chart of lord An&s;on's, he re&s;olved to tru&s;t to his own &s;agacity, conduct, and vigilance, to carry &s;afely through tho&s;e &s;treights a fleet of near two hundred &s;ail. So bold an attempt had never been made; but every precaution was taken to guard this bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dne&s;s from the imputation of te|merity. A ve&s;&s;el was &s;ent to reconnoitre the pa&s;&s;age, and, when returned, was ordered to take the lead; &s;ome frigates followed; &s;loops and boats were &s;tationed on the right and left on the &s;hallows, with well adapted &s;ignals both for the day and the night. The fleet moved in &s;even divi&s;ions. And being favoured with plea&s;ant weather, and &s;ecured by the admirable di&s;po&s;itions which were made, they, without the &s;malle&s;t lo&s;s or interruption, got clear thro' this perilous pa&s;&s;age on the 5th of June, having entered it on the 27th of May.</P>
<P>The Havannah, the object of their long voyage, and of &s;o many anxious hopes and fears, was now before them. This place is not denominated the capital of Cuba; St. Jago, &s;ituated at the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, has that title: but the Havannah, though the &s;econd in rank, is the fir&s;t in wealth, &s;ize, and importance. The harbour, upon which it &s;tands, is, in every re&s;pect, one of the be&s;t in the We&s;t In|dies, and perhaps in the world. It is entered by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, upwards of half a mile in length, which afterwards expands into a large ba&s;on, forming three <HI>cul de &s;aes;</HI> 

<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Deep Bays.</NOTE>

 and is &s;ufficient, in extent and depth, to contain a thou&s;and &s;ail of the large&s;t &s;hips, having almo&s;t throughout &s;ix fathom water, and being perfectly covered from every wind. In this bay the rich fleets from the &s;everal parts of the Spani&s;h
<PB N="497" REF="560">
We&s;t Indies, called the Galleons and the Flota, a&s;&s;emble, before they finally &s;et out on their voyage for Europe.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance has rendered the Havannah one of the mo&s;t opulent, flouri&s;hing, and populous cities in this part of the world. Great care was taken to fortify and &s;e|cure a place, which, by being the center of &s;o rich a com|merce, would naturally become the faire&s;t mark for the at|tempts of an enemy. The narrow entrance into this har|bour is &s;ecured on one &s;ide by a very &s;trong fort, called the Moro, (C) built upon a projecting point of land: on the other, it is defended by a fort called the Puntal, (D) which joins the town. The town it&s;elf, which is &s;ituated to the we&s;tward of the entrance of the harbour, and oppo&s;ite to the Moro fort, is &s;urrounded by a good rampart, (AA) flanked with ba&s;tions, and covered with a ditch.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, who had been for &s;ome time preparing for war, had formed a con&s;iderable navy in the We&s;t Indies: this fleet, (q) which was near twenty &s;ail, mo&s;tly of the line, lay at this time in the ba&s;on of the Havannah; but they had not, when our armament appeared before the port, received, it &s;eems, any authentic account from their court concerning the commencement of ho&s;tilities between the two nations.</P>
<P>Whether the Spaniards were rendered inactive by the want of in&s;tructions, whether all their &s;hips were not in fighting condition, or whatever el&s;e was the cau&s;e, this fleet lay quiet in the harbour. If &s;ome of the above rea|&s;ons did not oppo&s;e, it may be very rationally &s;uppo&s;ed, that their be&s;t part would have been to come out, and fight our &s;quadron. They were not very far from an equality; and though the i&s;&s;ue of a battle might have proved unfa|vourable to them, yet a battle tolerably maintained would have much di&s;abled our armament, and perhaps have been a means of preventing the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole enterprize. The lo&s;s of their fleet in this way might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;aved the city; but, the city, once taken, nothing could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave the fleet. It is true, they much tru&s;ted, and not wholly without rea&s;on, to the &s;trength of the place, and to tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing difficulties which attend any military operation, that is drawn out to length in this unhealthy climate. In other re&s;pects, they were very far from being deficient in proper mea&s;ures for their defence. They made a &s;trong boom (p) acro&s;s the mouth of the harbour; and almo&s;t the
<PB N="496" REF="561">

<PB N="498" REF="563">
only u&s;e they made of their &s;hipping, in the defence of the place, was to &s;ink three of them (n) behind this boom.</P>
<P>When all things were in readine&s;s for landing, the admi|ral, with a great part of the fleet, bore away to the we&s;t|ward, (s) in order to draw the enemy's attention from the true object, and made a feint, as if he intended to land up|on that &s;ide; while commodore Keppel and captain Har|vey, commanding a detachment of the &s;quadron, approach|ed the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward (t) of the harbour, and effected a landing there in the utmo&s;t order,

 <MILESTONE N="June 7."> 

 without any oppo&s;ition, having previou&s;ly &s;ilenced a &s;mall fort, (F) which might have given &s;ome di&s;tur|bance.</P>
<P>The principal body of the army was de&s;tined to act upon this &s;ide. It was divided into two corps; one of which was advanced a con&s;iderable way in the country, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the harbour, in order to cover the &s;iege, and to &s;ecure our parties employed in watering and procuring provi&s;ions. This corps was commanded by general Elliot. The other was immediately occupied in the attack on Fort Moro, (w) to the reduction of which the efforts of the En|gli&s;h were principally directed, as the Moro commanded the town, and the entrance of the harbour. This attack was conducted by general Keppel. To make a diver&s;ion in favour of this grand operation, a detachment, under colonel How, was encamped to the we&s;tward of the town. This body cut off the communication between the town and the country, and kept the enemy's attention divided. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to make a better, of the land forces during the whole &s;iege.

<P><PB N="499" REF="565">The hard&s;hips which the Engli&s;h army &s;u&s;tained, in car|rying on the &s;iege of the Moro, are almo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible: the earth was every where &s;o thin, that it was with great difficulty they could cover them&s;elves in their approaches. There was no &s;pring or river near them; it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring water from a great di&s;tance; and &s;o precarious and &s;canty was this &s;upply, that they were obliged to have re|cour&s;e to water from the &s;hips. Roads for communication were to be cut through thick woods; the artillery was to be dragged for a va&s;t way over a rough rocky &s;hore. Several dropped down dead with heat, thir&s;t, and fatigue. But &s;uch was the re&s;olution of our people, &s;uch the happy and perfect unanimity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the land and the &s;ea &s;ervices, that no difficulties, no hard&s;hips, &s;lackened for a moment the operations again&s;t this important, &s;trong, and well defended place. Batteries were, in &s;pite of all difficulties, rai&s;ed again&s;t the Moro, and along the hill upon which this fort &s;tands, in order to drive the enemy's &s;hips deeper into the harbour, and thus to prevent them from mole&s;ting our approaches.</P>
<P>The enemy's fire, and that of the be&s;iegers, was for a long time pretty near on an equality, and it was kept up with great vivacity on both &s;ides. The Spaniards in the fort communicated with the town, from which they were
<PB N="500" REF="566">
recruited and &s;upplied; they did not rely &s;olely on their works;

 <MILESTONE N="June 29."> 

 they made a &s;ally with &s;ufficient re&s;olution, and a con&s;iderable force, but with lit|tle &s;ucce&s;s. They were obliged to retire, with a lo&s;s of two or three hundred men left dead on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e works were thus vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hed on &s;hore, the navy, not contented with the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they had before lent to every part of the land &s;ervice, re&s;olved to try &s;omething further, and which was more di|rectly within their own province, towards the reduction of the Moro. Accordingly, the day the batteries on &s;hore were opened, three of their greate&s;t &s;hips, (g) the Dragon, the Cambridge, and the Marlborough, under the conduct of capt. Harvey, laid their broad&s;ides again&s;t the fort,

 <MILESTONE N="July 1."> 

 and began a terrible fire, which was returned with great ob&s;tinacy. This firing, one of the warm|e&s;t ever &s;een, continued for &s;even hours, without intermi&s;|&s;ion. But in this cannonade the Moro, which was &s;ituated upon a very high and &s;teep rock, had great advantages over the &s;hips, and was proof again&s;t all their efforts. Be&s;ides, the fire from the oppo&s;ite fort of Puntal, and the batteries of the town, galled them extremely. In&s;omuch that, in order to &s;ave the &s;hips from ab&s;olute de&s;truction, they were obliged at length, tho' unwilling, to bring them all off. Even this retreat was not effected without difficulty, as the &s;hips were very much &s;hattered in this long and unequal conte&s;t. They had one hundred and fifty men killed and wounded; and one of the captains, captain Goo&s;trey of the Marlborough, a brave and experienced officer, was al&s;o killed. The captains Harvey and Burnett gained, with better fortune, an equal honour, by their firm and intrepid behaviour throughout the whole operation.</P>
<P>This bold attempt, though it had very little effect upon the works on that &s;ide of the fort which the &s;hips attacked, was neverthele&s;s of con&s;iderable &s;ervice. The enemy's at|tention being diverted to that &s;ide, the other was a good deal neglected: our fire was poured in the mean time with redoubled fury from the batteries; it became much &s;uperi|or to that of the enemy, and did no &s;mall damage to their works. But the moment the Spaniards were relea&s;ed from their attention to our men of war, they returned again to the ea&s;tward face of the fort: their defence was revived with as much vigour as before; on both &s;ides a con&s;tant un|remitted
<PB N="501" REF="567">
fire was kept up, with a fierce emulation, for &s;eve|ral days. It now became evident, that the reduction of this fortre&s;s was to be a work of time. Never, from the beginning of the war, had the Engli&s;h valour been &s;o well matched. Here was at length an adver&s;ary worthy of our arms, and our whole military &s;kill and &s;pirit was put to the &s;evere&s;t trial.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this &s;harp and doubtful contention, the capital battery again&s;t the fort unfortunately took fire;

 <MILESTONE N="July 3."> 

 and being chiefly con&s;tructed of timber and fa&s;cines dried by the inten&s;e heats and continual cannonade, the flames &s;oon got a-head, and became too powerful for oppo&s;ition. The battery was almo&s;t wholly con&s;umed. The labour of &s;ix hundred men, for &s;even|teen days, was de&s;troyed in a moment; and all was to be|gin anew.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying &s;troke. It was felt the more &s;e|verely, becau&s;e the other hard&s;hips of the &s;iege were be|come by this time almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The &s;ickne&s;s, &s;omething of which the troops had brought with them from Martinico, and which increa&s;ed infinitely in this unwhole|&s;ome country and rigorous &s;ervice, had reduced the army to half its number, at the &s;ame time that it doubled the fa|tigue of tho&s;e few who &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome remains of &s;trength. Five thou&s;and &s;oldiers were at one, time down in various di&s;tempers; no le&s;s than three thou&s;and of the &s;eamen were in the &s;ame mi&s;erable condition. A total want of good provi&s;ions exa&s;perated the di&s;ea&s;e, and retarded the recovery. The deficiency of water was of all their grievan|ces the greate&s;t, and extremely aggravated all the re&s;t of their &s;ufferings. The procuring from a di&s;tance this wretch|ed &s;upply, &s;o unequal to their wants, exhau&s;ted all their force. Be&s;ides, as the &s;ea&s;on advanced, the pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ceeding grew fainter. The hearts of the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;unk within them, whil&s;t they beheld this gallant army wa&s;ting away by di&s;ea&s;es; and they could not avoid, trem|bling for that noble fleet, which had rid &s;o long on an open &s;hore, and which mu&s;t to all appearance, be expo&s;ed to in|evitable ruin, if the hurricane &s;ea&s;on &s;hould come on before the reduction of the place. A thou&s;and langui&s;hing and impatient looks were ca&s;t out for the reinforcement from North America. None however as yet appeared; and the exhau&s;ted army was left to its own endeavours. Many fell
<PB N="502" REF="568">
into de&s;pair, and died, overcome with fatigue, angui&s;h and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e cruel delays and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the &s;teadine&s;s of the commanders infu&s;ed life and activity into their troops, and rou&s;ed them to incredible exertions. The rich prize, which was before them; the &s;hame of returning home baffled; and even the &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance which was made by the enemy; all the&s;e motives called loudly on their intere&s;t, their honour, and their pride, and obliged them to the exertion of every nerve. Nobody could imagine that it was this reduced and &s;lender army, by which the&s;e a&s;to|ni&s;hing efforts were made, and this exten&s;ive &s;phere of duty &s;o perfectly filled. New batteries aro&s;e in the place of the old; the fire &s;oon became equal, and then &s;upe|rior to that of the enemy.

 <MILESTONE N="July 20."> 

 They by degrees &s;i|lenced the cannon of the fort, beat to pieces all the upper works, and made at length a lodgment in the covered way. There hopes were now become more lively. Some days before they had gained this grand advantage,

 <MILESTONE N="July 12."> 

 the Jamaica fleet appeared in its pa&s;&s;age to Europe, with &s;everal conveniences for the &s;iege. Not many days after this they received a con&s;iderable part of the New York reinforcement.

 <MILESTONE N="July 28."> 

 Some of the tran&s;ports in their pa&s;&s;age thro' the old Bahama Streights were lo&s;t, but the men were &s;aved on the adjacent i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The&s;e favourable events infu&s;ed double life into their ope|rations, in this advanced &s;tate of the &s;iege; but a new and grand difficulty appeared, ju&s;t at the &s;eeming accompli&s;h|ment of their work. An immen&s;e ditch yawned before them, for the greater part cut in the &s;olid rock, eighty feet deep, and forty feet wide. To fill it up by any means appeared impo&s;&s;ible. Difficult as the work of mining was in tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, it was the only expedient. It might have been an impracticable one, if fortunately a thin ridge of rock had not been left, in order to cover the ditch towards the &s;ea. On this narrow ridge,

 <MILESTONE N="July 20."> 

 the miners wholly uncovered, but with very little lo&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the ditch, and &s;oon buried them&s;elves in the wall.</P>
<P>It now became vi&s;ible to the governor of the Havannah, that the fort mu&s;t be &s;peedily reduced: if left to its own &s;trength. At all events &s;omething mu&s;t be done in this ex|igence
<PB N="503" REF="569">
for its immediate relief. Accordingly be|fore break of day a body of twelve hundred men,

 <MILESTONE N="July 22."> 

 mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of the country militia, Mulattoes and Negroes, were tran&s;ported acro&s;s the harbour, climbed the hills, and made three attacks upon our po&s;ts. But the ordinary guards, though &s;urpri&s;ed, defended them&s;elves &s;o re&s;olutely, that the Spaniards made little impre&s;&s;ion, and were not able to ruin any part of the approaches. The po&s;ts attacked were &s;peedily reinforced, and the enemy, who were little better than a di&s;orderly rabble, and not con|ducted by proper officers, fell into terror and confu&s;ion. They were driven precipitately down the hill with great &s;laughter; &s;ome gained their boats, others were drowned, and they lo&s;t in this well imagined, but ill executed &s;ally, upwards of four hundred men.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t effort for the relief of the Moro; which, abandoned as it was by the city, and while an enemy was undermining its walls, held out with a &s;ullen re&s;olution, and made no &s;ort of propo&s;al to capitulate. The mines at length did their bu&s;ine&s;s.

 <MILESTONE N="July 30."> 

 A part of the wall was blown up, and fell into the ditch; leaving a breach, which tho' very narrow and difficult, the general and engineer judged practicable. The Engli&s;h troops, who were commanded on the mo&s;t dangerous of all &s;ervices, re|joiced that it was to be the end of labours much more grievous to them. They mounted the breach, entered the fort, and formed them&s;elves with &s;o much celerity, and with &s;uch a &s;pirited coolne&s;s of re&s;olution, that the enemy, who were drawn up to receive them, and who might have made the a&s;&s;ault an affair of great blood&s;hed, a&s;toni&s;hed at their countenance, fled on all hands. About four hundred were &s;laughtered on the &s;pot, or ran to the water where they peri&s;hed. Four hundred more threw down their arms, and obtained quarter. The &s;econd in command, the mar|quis de Gon&s;ales, fell while he was making brave, but in|effectual efforts to animate and rally his people. Don Lewis de Vela&s;co, the governor, who had hitherto defended the fort with &s;uch ob&s;tinate bravery, &s;eemed re&s;olved in this extremity to &s;hare the &s;ame fate with it. He collected an hundred men in an entrenchment he had made round his colours. But &s;eeing that all his companions were fled from him, or &s;laughtered about him, di&s;daining to retire or call for quarter, he received a mortal wound, and fell, offering
<PB N="504" REF="570">
his &s;word to his conquerors. The Engli&s;h wept with pity and admiration over that unfortunate valour, which had oc|ca&s;ioned them &s;o many toil&s;ome hours, and co&s;t them &s;o many lives.</P>
<P>Thus the Moro came into our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion after a vigorous &s;truggle, forty-four days from the time the fir&s;t operations had been begun again&s;t it. No time was lo&s;t to profit of this great advantage, notwith&s;tanding that the &s;ickne&s;s &s;till raged like a pe&s;tilence, and that many new and great works were to be undertaken. Not only the fire of the fort was turned again&s;t the town, but a line of batteries (l) was erect|ed along the hill of the Cavannos, on the extremity of which the fort &s;tands. By the&s;e batteries which mounted three and forty pieces of cannon, and twelve mortars, almo&s;t the whole ea&s;tern &s;ide of the city was commanded from one end to the other. Preparations for an attack were al&s;o made, and batteries erected to the we&s;tward of the town, which on that &s;ide had hitheto been only watched. Some time before a part of the &s;econd divi&s;ion of the troops from North America had arrived.

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 2."> 

 A part had been taken by a &s;quadron of French men of war; but tho&s;e who e&s;caped, came very &s;ea&s;onably, and were of &s;ig|nal &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When tho&s;e preparations were perfectly ready to take effect,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 10."> 

 lord Albemarle by a me&s;&s;age repre|&s;ented to the governor the irre&s;i&s;tible force of the attack, which he was ready to make upon the town, but which, in order to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary effu&s;ion of blood, he was willing to &s;u&s;pend, that the Spaniards might have lei|&s;ure to capitulate. The governor in a re&s;olute but civil manner returned, that he would defend the place committed to him to the la&s;t extremity, and began in&s;tantly to fire.</P>
<P>To convince the governor that the menaces employed were not an empty boa&s;t, lord Albemarle the very next morning ordered a general fire from the batteries, which was poured from all &s;ides, with &s;uch continued and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble fury, that in &s;ix hours almo&s;t all the enemy's guns were &s;ilenced. To the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the fleet and army, flags of truce appeared from every quarter of the town. A capitulation en&s;ued, in which the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, the former laws, and private property were &s;ecured to the inha|bitants. The garri&s;on, which was reduced to about &s;even hundred men had the honours of war, and were to be con|veyed
<PB N="505" REF="571">
to Spain. A di&s;trict of an hundred and eighty miles we&s;tward of the Havannah was yielded along with the town. The Spaniards &s;truggled a long time to &s;ave the men of war; but this was a capital point, and wholly inadmi&s;&s;ible. They al&s;o made &s;ome attempts to have the harbour declared neu|tral during the war; but this was no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the completene&s;s of the conque&s;t, and was &s;teadily refu&s;ed. After two days altercation, they gave up the&s;e points, and the Engli&s;h troops were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Havannah on the 14th of Augu&s;t, when they had been before it two months and eight days.</P>
<P>Although we have not pur&s;ued in exact order all the de|tail of the more minute operations of this memorable &s;iege, we have dwelt on it a longer time, than we have on our plan generally allowed to &s;uch tran&s;actions; becau&s;e it was, without que&s;tion, in it&s;elf the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and in its con&s;equences the mo&s;t deci&s;ive conque&s;t we have made &s;ince the beginning of the war; and becau&s;e in no operation were the courage, &s;teadine&s;s, and per&s;everance of the Briti&s;h troops and the conduct of their leaders more con&s;picious. The acqui&s;iton of this place united in it&s;elf all the advan|tages which can be acquired in war. It was a military ad|vantage of the highe&s;t cla&s;s; it was equal to the greate&s;t naval victory, by its effect on the enemy's marine; and in the plunder it equalled the produce of a national &s;ub&s;idy. Nine &s;ail of the enemy's &s;hips of the line, &s;ome of the fine&s;t ve&s;&s;els in the world, were taken, with four frigates. Three of their capital &s;hips had been, as already mentioned, &s;unk by them&s;elves at the beginning of the &s;iege; two more were in forwardne&s;s on the &s;tocks, and the&s;e were de&s;troyed by the Engli&s;h. The enemy, on this occa&s;ion, lo&s;t a whole fleet. In ready money, in the tobacco collected at the Ha|vannah on account of the king of Spain, and in other valu|able merchandizes, the plunder did not perhaps fall &s;hort of three millions &s;terling

<P>I HAVE the honour of informing your Lord&s;hip, that the town of the <HI>Havannah,</HI> with all its dependencies, and the men of war in the harbour, &s;urrendered to his maje&s;ty's arms by capitulation on the 13th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of the capitulation, various returns, and the chief engineer's continuation of the journal of the &s;iege of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> fort, which was taken by &s;torm on the 30th of la&s;t month, &s;o much to the honour and credit of his maje&s;ty's troops, and to major general <HI>Keppel,</HI> who commanded the attack, that I &s;hould do them inju&s;tice if I did not mention them in a particular man|ner to your lord&s;hip. Our mines were &s;prung about one o'clock, and a breach made ju&s;t practicable for a file of men in front. The enemy was drawn up on the top of it, in force with a &s;eeming de|termination to defend it; the attack was &s;o vigorous and impe|tuous, that the enemy was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly drove from the breach, and his maje&s;ty's &s;tandard planted upon the ba&s;tion.</P>
<P>I did not &s;end a particular expre&s;s with this good news to your lord&s;hip, becau&s;e I flattered my&s;elf, that what has happened would &s;oon be the con&s;qeuence of our &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Fort Moro.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the 11th in the morning, by a &s;ignal from the fort, we opened our batteries again&s;t the town, and <HI>Punta</HI> fort: The guns and mortars were &s;o well &s;erved by the artillery and &s;ailors, and their effect &s;o great, that in le&s;s than &s;ix hours all the guns in the fort and north ba&s;tion were &s;ilenced. The governor hung out the white flag, and beat a parley; and at the &s;ame time &s;ent out an officer to propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for twenty-four hours in or|der to prepare the articles of capitulation.</P>
<P>I &s;ent on board the <HI>Namur</HI> to the Admiral, to inform him of the governor's propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Pocock</HI> immediately came to my quarters, and we agreed to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities to the 13th at twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I &s;ummoned the governor on the 10th. His an&s;wer was very civil and proper; at the &s;ame time &s;aid he would defend his town to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>The difficulties the officers and &s;oldiers have met with, and the fatigues they have &s;o chearfully and re&s;olutely gone through &s;ince the army fir&s;t landed on this i&s;land, are not to be de&s;cribed. They de&s;erve from me the greate&s;t commendations; and I mu&s;t intreat your lord&s;hip to take the fir&s;t opportunity of informing his maje&s;ty how much I think my&s;elf obliged to lieut. general <HI>Elliot,</HI> and the re&s;t of the general officers under my command; to every officer and &s;oldier in the army; and to the officers and &s;ailors of his ma|je&s;ty's fleet, for the zealous manner with which they have carried on the &s;ervice, and for the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have received from them. Happy we &s;hall all think our&s;elves, if our conduct meets with his maje&s;ty's approbation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Pocock</HI> and commodore <HI>Keppel</HI> have exerted them|&s;elves in a mo&s;t particular manner: And I may venture to &s;ay, that there never was a joint undertaking carried on with more harmony and zeal on both &s;ides, which greatly contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Nugent,</HI> one of my Aid-de-Camps, who has the honour of delivering you my di&s;patches, can inform your lord&s;hip of any particulars you are plea&s;ed to learn from him, He has been very active, and pre&s;ent at every material affair that has happened &s;ince the landing of the troops. I mu&s;t beg through your lord&s;hip to recommend him to his maje&s;ty as a very de&s;erving young man. He carries with him the Spani&s;h en&s;ign taken at the <HI>Moro.</HI></P>
<P>Colonel Carleton, who has acted as brigadier &s;ince lord <HI>Rollo</HI> left the army, had the misfortune of being wounded on the 22d of <HI>July,</HI> when the enemy made a &s;ortie: He is at pre&s;ent in a fair way of doing well;</P>
<P>I think it but ju&s;tice to major <HI>Fuller,</HI> who is my elder Aid-de-Camp, to &s;ay, that I &s;hould have &s;ent him to England, if I had not thought it would be more agreeable to his maje&s;ty to receive the news by one of his own &s;ervants.</P>

<P>The <HI>Moro</HI> fort was taken by &s;torm on the 30th of la&s;t month, after a &s;iege of twenty-nine days; during which time the enemy lo&s;t above a thou&s;and men, and a brave officer in Don <HI>Lewis de Vala&s;co,</HI> captain of one of their men of war, and governor in the <HI>Moro,</HI> mortally wounded in defending the colours &s;word in hand in the &s;torm: And on the 11th in&s;tant, the governor of the Ha|vannah de&s;ired to capitulate for the town, which was granted, the articles agreed to, and &s;igned, (a copy of which I enclo&s;e) and we were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Punta and land gate the 14th. With this great and important acqui&s;ition to his maje&s;ty, have al&s;o fallen twelve men of war of the line, as per li&s;t, three of which were &s;unk, with a company's &s;hip, in the entrance of the harbour; nine are fit for &s;ea, and two on the &s;tocks; a blow that I hope will prove the more capital to the enemy, as they receive it &s;o early in the war; and, I may venture to &s;ay, will leave all their &s;ettlements, in this part of the world, expo&s;ed to any attempts that may be thought proper to be made on them. But however trivial, with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Havannah, it may appear, yet I cannot help mentioning the di&s;covery and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of the harbour of Mariel, about &s;even leagues to the leward of this, and which we had made our&s;elves ma&s;ters of, though the enemy had endeavour|ed to ruin it by &s;inking &s;hips in the entrance: and we had lately &s;ent near one hundred tran&s;ports with &s;ome men of war there, for &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;ea&s;on, in which we are already advanced.</P>
<P>It will be as needle&s;s, as almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, for me to expre&s;s or de&s;cribe that perfect harmony that has uninterruptedly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the fleet and the army, from our fir&s;t &s;etting out. Indeed it is doing inju&s;tice to both, to mention them as two corps, &s;ince each has endeavoured, with the mo&s;t con&s;tant and chearful emu|lation, to render it but one; uniting in the &s;ame principles of ho|nour and glory for their King and Country's &s;ervice. I am glad, on this occa&s;ion, to do ju&s;tice to the di&s;tingui&s;hed merit of Com|modore Keppel, who executed the &s;ervice, under his direction, on the Coxmar &s;ide, with the greate&s;t &s;pirit, activity and dili|gence; and I mu&s;t repeat that the zeal of his maje&s;ty's &s;ea officers and &s;eamen exerted in carrying on the &s;ervices alloted to them, is highly to be commended.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg leave to refer their Lord&s;hips to capt. Harvey for all further particulars, who I &s;end with this letter, and who has approved him&s;elf a brave and de&s;erving officer in this expedi|tion; therefore think my&s;elf obliged to de&s;ire their lord&s;hips will recommend him to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Letter from Sir <HI>George Pocock</HI> to Mr. <HI>Cleveland,</HI> dated off <HI>Chorera</HI> River, the 16th of <HI>Aug. 1762,</HI> inclo&s;ed in the fore|going of the 19th.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 28th of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Intrepide</HI> arrived, with 11 &s;ail of tran|&s;ports, with troops from <HI>New York.</HI> They &s;ailed from thence the 11th of <HI>June.</HI> The <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> and four tran&s;ports run on <HI>Cayo Comfite,</HI> the entrance of the Bahama Streights on the Cuba &s;ide, the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> an hour before day light, and were &s;tranded, but lo&s;t no &s;eamen or &s;oldiers. The <HI>Intrepide</HI> met the <HI>Richmond</HI> the day after, who was looking out for the convoy. Capt. <HI>Elphin&s;ton</HI> returned with the three tran&s;ports which were cleared, in order to bring away the &s;eamen and troops who were on &s;hore; and, to make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, I &s;ent away the <HI>Echo, Cygnet</HI> and <HI>Thunder</HI> bomb, to meet the <HI>Richmond,</HI> and to take the men out of her; and ordered captain <HI>Elphin&s;ton</HI> to take the <HI>Cygnet</HI> with him, and proceed up the Streights to meet the &s;econd divi|&s;ion of tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>The 2d in&s;tant, the <HI>Echo</HI> and bomb returned with the &s;econd divi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of eleven &s;ail of tran&s;ports, which &s;ailed from <HI>New York</HI> the 30th of <HI>June.</HI> The <HI>Richmond, Lizard, Enterprize, Cygnet,</HI> and <HI>Porcupine</HI> &s;loop, arrived the 8th, bringing with them all the &s;eamen and &s;oldiers from the &s;hips that were wrecked. Captain <HI>Banks</HI> informed me, that, on the 21&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> at three o'clock in the afternoon, being near the pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Maya Guanna,</HI> and the <HI>North Caicos,</HI> he di&s;covered two <HI>French</HI> &s;hips of the line, three frigates, and &s;ix &s;ail of brigantine and &s;loops; that the men of war and frigates gave chace to the convoy; and that five of the tran&s;ports were taken with 350 regulars of <HI>An&s;truther</HI>'s regiment, and 150 provincial troops on board of them. All the re&s;t of the troops arrived and landed in perfect health.</P>
<P>I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to order the <HI>Sutherland</HI> and <HI>Dover</HI> to be fitted as flags of truce, taking out their lower tier of guns in order to accommodate the late <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> commodore, the governor of the <HI>Havannah,</HI> the viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> and the governor of <HI>Car|thagena,</HI> to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and then return to <HI>England.</HI> Tran&s;ports are getting ready for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, agreeable to the capitulation, which I hope we &s;hall be able to di&s;patch in a few days.</P>
<P>I have not been able to collect an account of the killed and wounded &s;eamen belonging to the different &s;hips &s;ince the begin|ning of the &s;iege, who were employed at the batteries on &s;hore, but it &s;hall go by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>

<P><PB N="506" REF="572">Spain now began very &s;en&s;ibly to feel the inconveniences and mi&s;eries &s;he had voluntarily drawn on her&s;elf, by enter|ing into a war &s;o fatal to her. No &s;ooner had the news of

entirely vani&s;hed: the prodigious advantages they had vain|ly expected to flow from the <HI>family compact,</HI> were now ren|dered abortive, and grief and de&s;pair were the melancholy offspring of inju&s;tice and ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="575">Great Britain, on the contrary, as prudent in the enjoy|ment of victory, as brave in gaining it, &s;eemed not &s;o elated with her good fortune, as to make her indulge in the luxu|rious
<PB N="510" REF="576">
lap of indolence, but determined by the pro&s;ecution of the war in the &s;ame able and vigorous manner, to compel her enemies to &s;ue for that peace they had, when offered, haughtily refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>To effect &s;o great, &s;o de&s;irable a work, it was thought the reduction of the Philippine i&s;lands would not a little contribute; that enterprize was therefore formed, and en|tru&s;ted to the execution of two great men, who had on many occa&s;ions before, &s;ignalized them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country, and approved them&s;elves equal to the greate&s;t things: the&s;e were General Draper, and Admiral Corni&s;h. The troops allotted for the &s;ervice, were the 79th regiment, and a company of the royal artillery, 30 of the artillery furni&s;hed by the gentlemen of Madra&s;s, 600 Seapoys, a com|pany
<PB N="511" REF="577">
of Caffrees, one of Topazes, and one of Pioneers; to which were added, the precarious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two compa|nies of Frenchmen, enli&s;ted in their &s;ervice, with &s;ome hun|dreds of unarmed La&s;cars, for the u&s;e of the engineers, and park of artillery. This little &s;upply of men was farther re|inforced with a fine battalion of 550 &s;eamen, and 270 good marines; &s;o that the whole force amounted to 2300 men, who, with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores, were embarked on board of his maje&s;ty's &s;quadron, and two India &s;hips employed as tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>As it may appear &s;urprizing &s;o important a conque&s;t &s;hould be attempted with &s;o &s;mall a force, when a greater might be employed, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that if more were drawn from the coa&s;ts the &s;ettlements would be in dan|ger; and therefore, it may be thought advi&s;eable, rather to attempt with a few brave men, a place that was unprepared (as imagined) for &s;uch a vi&s;it, than by employing a greater force to &s;ubject our own colonies to ho&s;tile attempts, and, perhaps, to give the enemy time to be aware of our de&s;igns.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t the forces &s;et &s;ail, the Seahor&s;e, Capt. Grant, having been previou&s;ly di&s;patched through the &s;treights of Malacca, to the entrance of the China &s;ea, to &s;top all ve&s;&s;els that might be bound to Manila, or &s;ent from any of the neighbouring &s;ettlements to give the Spaniards intelligence of the de&s;ign. On the 23d of the following month they anchored in Manila bay, and found that their vi&s;it was unexpected, and the enemy unprepared. To in|crea&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible their vi&s;ible confu&s;ion and con&s;ter|nation, it was determined to lo&s;e no time in the attack of the port of Cavite, as at fir&s;t determined, but proceed directly to the grand object, the city of Manila, the general and admiral rightly judging, that their conque&s;t of that impor|tant place would of cour&s;e occa&s;ion and draw after it the fall of Cavite.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, a &s;ummons was &s;ent to the governor to &s;urrender the town,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 24."> 

 but it had no effect on him; wherefore the admi|ral and &s;ome other principal officers examined the coa&s;t, in order to fix upon a proper &s;pot for landing the troops, ar|tillery, and &s;tores. About two miles to the &s;outh of Manila a convenient place was found. Accordingly all the boats were prepared, and the frigates &s;ent in very near the &s;hore, to cover the de&s;cent. The&s;e latter kept up a very bri&s;k
<PB N="512" REF="578">
fire to the right and left, to protect the flanks, and di&s;per&s;e the enemy who were a&s;&s;embled in great numbers, both hor&s;e and foot, to oppo&s;e a de&s;cent. It had the de&s;ired effect. The Spaniards retired, and left a clear coa&s;t; but a violent &s;urf ari&s;ing, many boats were da&s;hed to pieces, the arms and ammunition much damaged, but providentially, no lives were lo&s;t. The troops then formed upon the beach, march|ed, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Malatta, fixed their out-po&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ed the whole night under arms. The Spaniards in the mean time, were employed in burning of their &s;uburbs. The next day a fort, named the Polveri&s;ta, which the enemy had abandoned was &s;eized,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 25."> 

 which proved a mo&s;t excellent place of arms for covering the landing of the &s;tores, and &s;ecuring a commu|nication with the &s;quadron. Colonel Mon&s;on, who had been detached by the general with 200 men to view the roads and approaches to Manila, occupied the Hermita church, which was large and commodious, and about 900 yards from the city. Orders were then &s;ent to major Moore to march up with the 79th regiment, to &s;ecure and maintain that po&s;t, which was performed with great activity and good conduct. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was then taken of St. Jago's church, near the &s;ea, it being looked on as a place of infinite impor|tance towards the carrying on their operations.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the admiral &s;ent on &s;hore the battalions of &s;eamen under the command of the captains Collins, of the Weymouth, Pitchford of the America, and George Ourry from the Panther. The re&s;t of the company's troops of all &s;orts were likewi&s;e landed, and put under cover. The Spa|niards advanced out of the garri&s;on, under the command of the chevalier Fayet, with 400 men, and two field pieces, and from a church about 200 yards to the right of St. Jago's church, began a cannonade upon the right flank of the troops po&s;ted there. Some &s;eapoys, under en&s;ign Carty, were &s;ent to &s;kirmi&s;h with them, &s;upported by three picquets of the 79th regiment, and 100 &s;eamen, all under the com|mand of colonel Mon&s;on, who &s;oon drove the enemy back into the town.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior &s;kill and bravery of the Engli&s;h troops were &s;o evident from this affair, that it occa&s;ioned a &s;econd &s;um|mons to the governor, but to no purpo&s;e; the an&s;wer was much more &s;pirited than their conduct had been. The church from whence the Spaniards had been driven, colonel
<PB N="513" REF="579">
Mon&s;on had orders to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, if he found it tena|ble, from the top of which a perfect view was had of the enemy's works. The front they were obliged to attack, was defended by the ba&s;tions of St. Diego and St. Andrew, with orillons and retired flanks; a ravelin which covered the royal gate, a wet ditch, covered way, and glacis, but all the&s;e works were out of repair, except the ba&s;tions, which were in excellent order, and lined with a great number of fine bra&s;s cannon. It became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ound the ditch, and which might have proved a very perilous en|terprize, had the Spaniards been careful in po&s;ting centries on the covered way, but their omi&s;&s;ion and negligence made it the more ea&s;y. It was therefore undertaken and effected by a &s;mall party of the 79th regiment under captain Fletcher, with the lo&s;s only of three men.</P>
<P>The city of Manila being of great extent, and the num|ber of men employed to reduce it very &s;mall, it became impo&s;&s;ible to inve&s;t it on every &s;ide; two &s;ides therefore were con&s;tantly open to the enemy to introduce &s;upplies of men and provi&s;ions, and carry out their effects. The gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 800 men of the royal regiment under the command of the marquis of Villa Mediana, brigadier gene|ral, which was farther reinforced by a body of 10,000 In|dians. It is evident from hence, that the di&s;advantages un|der which the Engli&s;h forces laboured could not be remedied, nor could there be any rea&s;onable ground for &s;ucce&s;s, but in the prudence and wi&s;dom of the general, and the matchle&s;s intrepidity of the troops.</P>
<P>The city continued thus inve&s;ted, and was cannonaded both by the batteries erected, and the frigates, which were brought up till the 2d of October, when a battery for twen|ty-four pounders was completed, and a mortar battery for the heavy &s;hells of ten and twelve inches, which made a good parallel, and communication from the church to the gun battery, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;pacious place of arms on the left of it, near the &s;ea. The&s;e were greatly facilitated by the roaring of the waves, it being very tempe&s;tuous weather, and which prevented the Spaniards from hearing the noi&s;e of the workmen, who gave no &s;ort of interruption, but &s;eemed to tru&s;t entirely to the elements. In the mean time, the governor, who was an archbi&s;hop, gave out, that an Angel from the Lord was gone forth to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h, like the ho&s;t of Senacherib. In the afternoon the &s;eamen,
<PB N="514" REF="580">
with great activity and indefatigable labour had brought up and mounted all the guns in the bat|tery,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 2."> 

 which were ma&s;ked.</P>
<P>A &s;ally was made the 4th by 1000 of the Indians, who attacked the cantonment of the &s;eamen; but upon the alarm, colonel Mon&s;on and captain Fletcher, with the picquets, being di&s;patched to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the enemy was repul&s;ed, and forced to fly, with the lo&s;s of 300 men. Had the &s;kill and weapons of the&s;e Indians, who are a wild and barbarous people from the province of Pampanga, been equal to their &s;trength and ferocity, the di&s;per&s;ion of them might not have been &s;o ea&s;y; for though armed chiefly with bows, arrows, and lances; they advanced up to the very muzzles of their enemy's pieces, repeated their a&s;&s;aults, and died like wild bea&s;ts, gnawing the bayonets. In this &s;kirmi&s;h, captain Porter, a brave and experienced &s;ea officer was &s;lain. Scarce were the Indians thus routed, when another body of them, with part of the Spani&s;h garri&s;on, attacked the church, and forced the &s;eapoys from their po&s;t in it, neare&s;t the town, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the top, from whence they killed and wounded &s;everal of the Engli&s;h, who were entirely expo&s;ed to all their weapons. Notwith&s;tanding their di&s;advantage|ous &s;ituation, the European &s;oldiers maintained their po&s;t behind the church with great patience and firmne&s;s, and at la&s;t di&s;lodged the enemy, with the lo&s;s of captain Strahan, of the 79th regiment, and 40 private men wounded or killed. The Spaniards left 70 dead behind them in and about the church. This was their la&s;t effort. All their Indians, ex|cepting 1800, di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s, returned home, and the fire of the be&s;iegers continuing with unremitted fury, the next day a breach appeared practicable, and it was thought the Spaniards, &s;en&s;ible of their danger, would think of giv|ing up the town: but they were ob&s;tinate without bravery, or any generous re&s;olution of defending the breach.</P>
<P>The next day, at four in the morning, in con&s;equence of a re&s;olution formed the preceding night, the troops filed off from their quarters in &s;mall bodies to give the le&s;s &s;u&s;picion to the enemy,

 <MILESTONE N="Aug. 6."> 

 with an in|tention of &s;torming the town, and by degrees, a&s;&s;embled at St. Jago's church, ob&s;erving the utmo&s;t &s;ilence, and conceal|ing them&s;elves in the place of arms, and parallel between the church and the battery, while in the mean time a bri&s;k fire was kept up upon the works, and tho&s;e places where the
<PB N="515" REF="581">
enemy might be lodged or intrenched. At day break a large body of Spaniards was di&s;cerned, forming them&s;elves on the ba&s;tion of St. Andrew, but upon the explo&s;ion of &s;ome &s;hells that were thrown among them, they went off. Taking im|mediate advantage of this, and by the &s;ignal of a general di&s;charge of artillery and mortars, the troops ru&s;hed on to the a&s;&s;ault, under cover of a thick &s;moke that blew directly upon the town. Sixty volunteers of different corps under lieutenant Ru&s;&s;el of the 79th led the way, &s;upported by the grenadiers of that regiment. The engineers, with the pioneers and other workmen, to clear and enlarge the breach, and make lodgments, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould have been too &s;trongly intrenched in the gorge of the ba&s;tion, follow|ed. Col. Mon&s;on and major More were at the head of two grand divi&s;ions of the 79th; the battalion of &s;eamen advanc|ed next, &s;u&s;tained by the other two divi&s;ions of the 79th: and the company's troops clo&s;ed the rear. They all mount|ed the breach with amazing &s;pirit and rapidity, and di&s;per&s;ed the Spaniards with the greate&s;t facility. Little re&s;i&s;tance was given, except at the Royal gate, and from the galle|ries of the lofty hou&s;es which &s;urrounded the grand &s;quare. In the guard hou&s;e over the Royal gate, 100 of the Spa|niards and Indians who would not &s;urrender, were put to the &s;word; and according to the enemy's own account, 300 men were drowned in attempting to e&s;cape over the river, which was very deep and rapid. The governor and principal officers retired to the citadel, and were glad to &s;urrender as pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion, as that place was in no good po&s;ture of defence; the marquis of Villa Mediana, and the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h officers, were admitted as pri|&s;oners of war on their paroles of honour, and to conciliate the affections of the natives, all the Indians taken pri&s;o|ners, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The joy on taking this important place was greatly cloud|ed by the lo&s;s of major More, who being transfixed with an arrow near the Royal gate, died immediately, univer&s;ally lamented for his good qualities. A few officers only were wounded, and no more than 30 private men killed or wound|ed. In con&s;equence of the terms given to the Spaniards, the port of Cavite, and the citadel, with the i&s;lands and forts dependent on Manila, were given up to his Britannic ma|je&s;ty, and they were to pay four millions of dollars for the pre&s;ervation of the town and their effects.</P>

Our lo&s;s upon this occa&s;ion would have been trifling, but for the death of major <HI>More,</HI> a valiant good officer; and it is with particular &s;atisfaction I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that the firm bravery and per&s;everance of the troops, could only be equalled by their humanity after vic|tory. Out of re&s;pect and deference to Admiral <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> we waited till he came on &s;hore, and being de&s;irous to &s;ave &s;o fine a city from de&s;truction, we jointly dictated the annexed conditions to the governor general (the Archbi&s;hop) and the chief magi&s;trates, who mo&s;t readily embraced them.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering their critical &s;ituation, and va&s;t opulence, the terms were as rea&s;onable for them as beneficial to us. We allow the <HI>India</HI> company a third part of the ran&s;om, the whole of which amounts to a million &s;terling; and, according to my in&s;tructions, I have this day delivered up Manila, one of the riche&s;t cities and i&s;lands in this part of the world, with the port of <HI>Cavite,</HI> to <HI>Daw|&s;on Drake,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the other gentlemen appointed to receive them on behalf of the company, with all the artillery, ammunition, and warlike &s;tores found therein, agreeable to the inclo&s;ed inventories.</P>
<P>I have appointed major <HI>Fell</HI> of the 79th regiment to be com|mandant of the garri&s;on, which mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of all the troops brought from Madra&s;s, as the great extent of the place, its very numerous inhabitants, and un&s;ettled country, with the importance of the <HI>Cavite,</HI> demand at lea&s;t, this force for an effectual &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of the year, and condition of the &s;quadron, oblige us to defer the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubordinate places ceded to the crown, until the &s;hips have had a &s;ufficient repair; and I have the plea&s;ure to acquaint your Lord&s;hip, that the large quantity of naval &s;tores taken in the royal magazines at <HI>Cavite,</HI> &s;upply mo&s;t excellent materials for this purpo&s;e, in which the Admiral is inde|fatigable, who&s;e zeal for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, great cordiality, and con&s;tant attention to us during the whole cour&s;e of the expedi|tion, and fatiguing progre&s;s of the &s;iege, are beyond all prai&s;e. The other officers of the fleet exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t upon every occa&s;ion. As a &s;mall acknowledgment of our many obligations to Mr. <HI>Kempenfelt,</HI> the Admiral's captain. I begged his acceptance of the government of the citadel and port of <HI>Cavite,</HI> till it was given up to the company; his prudent and excellent re|gulations there were of infinite utility to the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The captains <HI>Collins, Pitchford,</HI> and <HI>George Ourry,</HI> who com|manded the battalion of &s;eamen, behaved with great &s;pirit and con|duct, and capt. <HI>Jocelyn,</HI> who was intru&s;ted with the care of the di&s;embarkations, gave us all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be wi&s;hed or expected from a diligent good officer. The marine officers and corps were of great &s;ervice, and the &s;eamen a&s;toni&s;hed us with mo&s;t extraordinary proofs of activity and valour, particularly tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at our batteries.</P>
<P>The reduction of <HI>Manila</HI> has been &s;o much owing to the con|&s;ummate &s;kill and bravery of Col. <HI>Mon&s;on,</HI> that I fear my faint re|pre&s;entations cannot do ju&s;tice to his merit; and I mo&s;t humbly beg leave, through your Lord&s;hip, to recommend him to his Ma|je&s;ty, together with the following officers, viz. Lieut. Col. <HI>Scott,</HI> Major <HI>Barker,</HI> who commanded our artillery; Capt. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> Major of Brigade; the engineers, Captains <HI>Stephen&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Cotsford,</HI> and En&s;ign <HI>Barnard;</HI> the Captains <HI>Moore</HI> and <HI>Pemble,</HI> aids-de-camp, who have all acted in their &s;everal departments with extraordinary merit, and greatly facilitated my good fortune. Both the royal and the company's artillery, with their other troops, behaved very well. In the la&s;t place, may I pre&s;ume to point out the &s;ervices of the 79th regiment, which, from the good conduct of their for|mer and pre&s;ent field-officers, has the peculiar merit of having fir&s;t &s;topped the progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> and not a little con|tributed to the happine&s;s and deci&s;ion of that war under Col <HI>Coote,</HI> and has &s;ince extended the glory of his Maje&s;ty's arms to the ut|mo&s;t verge of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Twenty-three officers, with upwards of 800 men have fallen in the cau&s;e of their country, &s;ince the regiment left <HI>England:</HI> Numbers of the &s;urvivors are wounded. Your Lord&s;hip's goodne&s;s encourages me to mention them as objects of compa&s;&s;ion and protection. Captain <HI>Fletcher</HI> has nine colours to lay at his Maje&s;ty's feet.</P>

<HEAD>Letter from Vice-Admiral <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Cleveland,</HI> dated in the Bay of <HI>Manila,</HI> <DATE>the 31&s;t of <HI>October, 1762.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure I have the honour to acquaint their lord&s;hips with the &s;ucce&s;s of his maje&s;ty's arms in the re|duction of the city of <HI>Manila,</HI> which was taken by &s;torm on the morning of the 9th in&s;tant. In my letters of the 23d and 31&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> I acquainted their lord&s;hips with my proceedings to that time; after which I u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible means at <HI>Madras</HI> for di&s;|patch; the decline of the S. W. mon&s;oon making it of the utmo&s;t importance. To promote this end, I compleated the <HI>Elizabeth, Grafton, Lenox, Weymouth,</HI> and <HI>Argo,</HI> with &s;uch of the troops and military &s;tores, as they were to take on board, and on the 29th &s;ent them away under the command of Commodore <HI>Tiddeman,</HI> to proceed to <HI>Malacca,</HI> with a view that they might compleat their water there by the time I &s;hould arrive with the remainder of the &s;quadron</P>
<P>Having accompli&s;hed the embarkation of every thing de&s;igned for the expedition, with a di&s;patch much beyond my expectations, as we had from the whole time of my being there a violent &s;urf to contend with, I &s;ailed the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t with the &s;hips undermen|tioned, viz. <HI>Norfolk, Panther, America, Seaford, South-Sea Ca&s;tle</HI> &s;tore &s;hips, Admiral <HI>Steven</HI>'s &s;tore-&s;hip, <HI>O&s;terly</HI> Company's &s;hip, leaving the <HI>Falmouth,</HI> at the reque&s;t of the pre&s;ident and council, to convoy the <HI>E&s;&s;ex India</HI> &s;hip, who was not ready to &s;ail, having the trea&s;ure to take on board the China cargoes, and to bring to Manila &s;uch of the company's &s;ervants, as were to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Government, if the expedition &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>The 19th, I arrived at Mallacca, and was di&s;appointed in not finding Mr. Tiddeman there, who did not join me till the 21&s;t having met with long calms: the difficulty of watering the &s;qua|dron at this place made it the 27th before I could leave the road.</P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>September</HI> I arrived off <HI>Pulo Timean,</HI> and was join|ed by capt, <HI>Grant,</HI> in the <HI>Seahor&s;e,</HI> whom I had detached, upon my fir&s;t arrival at <HI>Madra&s;s,</HI> to cruize between this i&s;land and the &s;traits of <HI>Sincapore,</HI> to &s;top any ve&s;&s;els he might &s;u&s;pect going to <HI>Manila.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th I made the coa&s;t of <HI>Luconia,</HI> but was drove off again by a &s;trong N. E. wind, which &s;eperated &s;ome of the &s;qua|dron. The 22d the gale broke up, and the wind &s;hifting to the S. W. the 23d we recovered the land again; the next day entered the bay of <HI>Manila,</HI> and in the clo&s;e of the evening anchored off the port of <HI>Cavite</HI> with the whole &s;quadron, except the <HI>South-Sea Ca&s;tle,</HI> and Admiral <HI>Stevens,</HI> the <HI>Falmouth</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> having joined me off the coa&s;t. In the night I &s;ent the ma&s;ters to &s;ound about the fortifications of <HI>Cavite,</HI> and, by their report found that it might be attacked by &s;hips.</P>
<P>The 25th in the morning, the wind not being favourable to at|tack the <HI>Cavite.</HI> I took two of the frigates, and with general <HI>Draper,</HI> and &s;ome other officers, reconnoitred the &s;hore about Ma|nila: and ob&s;erved &s;ome churches and other buildings to &s;tand near the works on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, particularly toward the S. W. ba&s;tion. We had &s;ome de&s;ign of attacking <HI>Cavite</HI> fir&s;t, to have had the conveniency of that port for the &s;hipping, but con|&s;idered that though the attack &s;hould be attended with all the &s;ucce&s;s we could hope, yet it would cau&s;e a delay at lea&s;t of two days before we could land at Manila, which time would afford opportunity to the enemy to demoli&s;h tho&s;e buidings near the works, and to prepare many ob&s;tacles to our landing and perhaps recover from that con&s;ternation our unexpected arrival had thrown them in; and &s;urther, Manila being the capital, if that fell, <HI>Ca|vite</HI> would in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I joined in opinion with the general to take advantage of circum&s;tances, &s;o favourable for a de&s;cent, and land the troops with all di&s;patch, and endeavour to get po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;ome po&s;ts near their works, which, if effected, would greatly facilitate the reduction of the city.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;olutions, I immediately made the &s;ignal on board the Seahor&s;e for the &s;quadron to join me, and for the troops to prepare to land. About &s;even in the evening the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9th re|giment, with the marines in the boats, under the direction of the captains <HI>Parker, Kempenfelt,</HI> and <HI>Brereton,</HI> pu&s;hed for the &s;hore; and under the fire of the three frigates, effected the landing at a church called the Moratta, about a mile and a half from the walls. We had no oppo&s;ition from the enemy; but &s;ome difficulty from the &s;urf, which ran high, and bilged all the long boats, but hap|pily lo&s;t no men.</P>
<P>The next morning the general took an advanced po&s;t about 200 yards from the glacis, and there, under cover of a blind, intended his battery again&s;t the face of the S. W. ba&s;tion. The number of troops being &s;mall, I landed a battalion of &s;eamen, con&s;i&s;ting of about 700 men, under the command of the Captains Collins, Pitchford, and George Ourry.</P>
<P>The 25th I di&s;patched three armed boats after a galley, coming up the bay to Manila; they came up with her, re&s;olutely boarded her; and took her, notwith&s;tanding &s;he kept up a &s;mart fire with patteraroes and mu&s;kets; &s;he mounted two carri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g and &s;eventeen bra&s;s &s;wivel guns, and had eighty men. By letters found in her, we di&s;covered &s;he was di&s;patched from the galleon <HI>St. Philippina,</HI> from <HI>Acapulca,</HI> and whom &s;he had left the 10th of <HI>September,</HI> at <HI>Cajaya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an,</HI> between the <HI>Embocad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and Cape <HI>Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itu Santa.</HI> Up|on this di&s;covery, I came to a re&s;olution to &s;end the <HI>Panther</HI> and <HI>Argo</HI> in que&s;t of her, but it was the 4th of <HI>October</HI> before the wea|ther permitted their &s;ailing.</P>
<P>The 28th of <HI>September</HI> the General acquainted me, that he was beginning to work on the battery, and that if &s;ome &s;hips could get near enough to throw &s;hot on the works of the town oppo&s;ite to it, it might take off &s;ome of the enemy's fire and attention, and there|by facilitate its con&s;truction. In con&s;equence of this, I ordered Commodore <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iddeman,</HI> with the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Falmouth,</HI> towards the town, as near as the depth of water would permit, and to place the &s;hips in &s;uch a po&s;ition as would be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;e in|tended, which was accordingly done the next day, and their fire had a very good effect.</P>
<P>On the 30th, the <HI>South Sea Ca&s;tle</HI> arrived with &s;tores which were much wanted, particularly the entrenching tools, for want of which the army had been &s;o greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that I was oblig|ed to employ all the forges in making &s;pades, pickaxes, &amp;c. for them. The fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> it began to blow fre&s;h, and in the night increa&s;ed to a hard gale, which drove the <HI>South Sea Ca&s;tle</HI> a&s;hore near the <HI>Pulveri&s;ta,</HI> a little to the &s;outhward of our camp. This accident, however, had &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages attend|ing it, as the &s;ituation &s;he lay in made her cannon a protection for the rear of our camp: it was likewi&s;e the means that all her mili|tary &s;tores were got on board with &s;afety and di&s;patch, and the army &s;upplied with the provi&s;ions &s;he had on board, both of which were articles they &s;tood in immediate need of, and which could not have been &s;upplied by boats, as it continued blowing weather for &s;everal days after, and the &s;urf breaking very high on the beach.</P>
<P>This gale was from the W. S. W. directly on the &s;hore, which gave me much concern for the &s;afety of the &s;quadron, particularly for the Elizabeth and Falmouth, who were only in four fathom wa|ter, and, as I have been &s;ince informed, &s;truck; but the bottom being mud, and &s;oft to a con&s;iderable depth, they received no damage. On the 4th in the morning, the General opened the battery, which was &s;o well managed, and &s;econded by the &s;hips before the town that in four hours the defences were taken off, and the next day in the evening the breach was made practicable.</P>
<P>On the 6th, at day light in the morning, the general's regiment, with the &s;ea battalion, mounted the breach, made the attack, and &s;oon got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the ba&s;tions, which completed the con|que&s;t. I immediately went on &s;hore, and with the General, had a meeting with the Spani&s;h Governor, and &s;ome of the principal officers, when a capitulation was agreed on, that the town and port of Cavite, with the i&s;lands and forts dependent on Manila, &s;hould be given up to his Britannick Maje&s;ty, and that they &s;hould pay four millions of dollars for the pre&s;ervation of the town and their effects, (a copy of which capitulation I have inclo&s;ed)</P>
<P>On the 10th I &s;ent capt. <HI>Kempenfelt</HI> in the <HI>Norfolk,</HI> with the <HI>Seaford</HI> and <HI>Seahor&s;e,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cavite, agreeable to the capitulation; by this acqui&s;ition we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very large quantity of naval &s;tores; and be&s;ide the advantage of almo&s;t every convenience for re&s;i&s;ting a &s;quadron, the people are &s;upplied with fre&s;h meat and vegetables in great plenty.</P>
<P>The &s;iege, though &s;hort, was attended with many difficulties and great fatigue, in which both the officers and men exerted them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s. We had con&s;tant fre&s;h gales, a lee &s;hore, and con&s;equently a high &s;urf to contend with, which made it always difficult, frequently hazardous and &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to land with boats. The rains fell very heavy; and our little army were &s;urrounded and harra&s;&s;ed by numerous bodies of Indians, who, though undi&s;ciplined, and armed only with lances, bows and arrows, yet by a daring re&s;olution and contempt of death, they became not only trouble&s;ome but formidable. I have the &s;atis|faction of acquainting their lord&s;hips, that throughout the whole expedition, the mo&s;t perfect harmony and unanimity have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between his maje&s;ty's land and &s;ea forces.</P>
<P>You will receive with this, an account of the number of officers and men, both &s;eamen and marines, that were landed from the &s;quadron, as likewi&s;e of the killed and wounded in each corps. It is with concern, I acquaint their lord&s;hips with the lo&s;s of com|modore <HI>Tiddeman,</HI> who, in attempting to enter the river in his barge, the morning after the reduction of Manila, was drowned with five of his people, by which unhappy accident, his Maje&s;ty has lo&s;t a brave and experienced officer.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Kempenfelt,</HI> by whom I &s;end this (and will pre&s;ent to you for their lord&s;hips a plan of the town of Manila, and the port of <HI>Cavite</HI>) has been of the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to me during the cour&s;e of this enterprize; he is very capable of furni&s;hing their lord&s;hips with many particulars nece&s;&s;ary for their information; and his great merit makes it my duty to recommend him as a very able and good officer.</P>

<P>The 7th in&s;tant capt. <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>Argo,</HI> returned with a letter from capt. <HI>Parker,</HI> acquainting me, that, in con&s;equence of my orders, having the 30th of <HI>October</HI> got the length of the i&s;land <HI>Capul,</HI> near the entrance into the <HI>Embocadera,</HI> in pur&s;uit of the St. Philippina, where the <HI>Argo</HI> had come to an anchor (and which he intended to do for that night) ju&s;t as the day clo&s;ed &s;aw a &s;ail, and &s;tanding to the northward; at eight in the evening he got &s;ight of the cha&s;e, about two leagues to leward, but unluckily by the rapidity of a counter current, to what the cha&s;e was in, drove among the Narrango's in the utmo&s;t danger of being lo&s;t, and obliged to anchor; the frigate having e&s;caped the danger, got up with the chace, and engaged her near two hours; but was &s;o roughly handled, that capt. King was obliged to bring too to re|pair his damages. By this time the current &s;lackened, which en|abled capt. Parker to get under &s;ail with the chace in &s;ight: about nine the next morning he came up with her, and after bat|tering her two hours within half mu&s;ket &s;hot, &s;he &s;truck. The enemy made but little re&s;i&s;tance, tru&s;ting to the immen&s;e thickne&s;s of the &s;ides of their &s;hip, which the Panther's &s;hot was not able to penetrate, except her upper works. Capt. Parker was no le&s;s di&s;|appointed than &s;urprized, when the general came on board, to find, that in&s;tead of the Saint Philippina, he had engaged and taken the Santi&s;&s;imo Trinadad, who departed from Manila the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> for <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and had got three hundred leagues to the ea&s;tward of the <HI>Embocadero;</HI> but meeting with a hard gale of wind, was di&s;ma&s;ted and put back to refit. She had eight hundred men on board, and pierced for &s;ixty guns, but when Capt. <HI>King</HI> engaged her, had only &s;ix mounted, and but thirteen when taken: &s;he draws thirty-three feet water, and is a much larger &s;hip than the <HI>Panther.</HI> I cannot a&s;certain the value of the cargo, but there is to the amount of one million and a half of dollars regi&s;tered, and &s;he is reputed &s;o be worth three millions.</P>
<P>Capt. King left the <HI>Panther</HI> with her prize at anchor about three leagues &s;outh of the <HI>Corrigedow,</HI> at the mouth of this bay; and as I have &s;ent a reinforcement of men with launches and warps, I hope very &s;oon to have her in &s;afety.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Propo&s;als for peace. State of the mini&s;try and parties. Dukes of Bedford and Nivernois employed in the negotiation. Newfoundland taken and retaken. War in Germany. He|reditary Prince defeated at Iohanni&s;berg. French repul&s;ed. Ca&s;&s;el inve&s;ted. Remarkable cannonade at Bucker Muhl. French take Amonebourg. Ca&s;&s;el &s;urrendered to the allies. War in We&s;tphalia concluded.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN France had found experimentally, that the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t was not the favourable time for drawing from her alliance all tho&s;e advantages with which &s;he flattered her&s;elf, &s;he inclined in good earne&s;t to peace, The &s;incerity of her procedure in the former negotiation might be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned; becau&s;e &s;he had prepared an af|ter game in ca&s;e of its breaking off. And &s;he &s;o much re|lied on it, that it is very po&s;&s;ible the negotiation it&s;elf was but a feint made to cover and to prepare that project. But finding that Great Britain was neither intimidated by the threats of that formidable alliance, nor at all likely to be re|duced by the exertion of its forces; &s;he came in good ear|ne&s;t into the&s;e pacific &s;entiments, which formerly &s;he had only counterfeited. The &s;low progre&s;s of the Bourbon troops in Portugal, the retrograde motion of the French army in
<PB N="525" REF="593">
Germany, the taking of Martinico and its dependencies, and the imminent danger in which they beheld the Havan|nah, all con&s;pired to humble the pride, and da&s;h the hopes of the Bourbon alliance.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of Great Britain likewi&s;e, the di&s;po&s;itions to peace became much more cordial. No people were ever le&s;s intoxicated with their &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Victories were be|come familiar to us, and made but little impre&s;&s;ion. The marks of public joy on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable conque&s;ts, were become much &s;lighter and colder, than were &s;hewed at the beginning of the war, upon very trivial advantages. Be&s;ides the nation had occa&s;ion for peace. Though her trade had been greatly augmented, a circum&s;tance without example favourable, and though many of her conque&s;ts, as we have &s;een, were very far from unlucrative, her &s;upplies of money, great as they were, did not keep pace with her ex|pences. The &s;upply of men too, which was nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h the wa&s;te of &s;o exten&s;ive a war, became &s;en&s;ibly di|mini&s;hed, and the troops were not recruited but with &s;ome difficulty, and at a heavy charge. It was time to clo&s;e the war, when every end, we could rationally propo&s;e to our|&s;elves in carrying it on, was an&s;wered; we had enough in our hands to an&s;wer all our demands, and almo&s;t all our ex|pectations; and as it is grown into a &s;ort of maxim, that nations greatly victorious, mu&s;t cede &s;omething on a peace, the difficulty on our &s;ide was only what, and how much we &s;hould retain. Not that there was a doubt, but whatever choice of acqui&s;ition could be made upon any rational prin|ciples, a great deal would &s;till remain to give the fulle&s;t &s;cope to every &s;entiment of equity and moderation,</P>
<P>All the&s;e were &s;ufficient inducements to peace. But other things operated as cau&s;es. An alteration in the &s;y&s;tem of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try had begun this war; another alteration put an end to it.</P>
<P>The whole council had been almo&s;t unanimous to oppo&s;e Mr. Pitt, in his &s;cheme for precipitating the declaration of war again&s;t Spain. They thought his principles too vio|lent, and they did not perfectly like his per&s;on. When he retired from publick bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;eemed as if they breathed more freely, and had got rid of a burthen that oppre&s;&s;ed them. But he was not long removed, when it appeared that the remaining part of the &s;y&s;tem, was framed upon principles &s;o very di&s;cordant in them&s;elves, that it was by no means likely to &s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="526" REF="594">The duke of Newca&s;tle, fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, by his early zeal in favour of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the libe|ral and politic u&s;e he had made of a great fortune, by the ob|ligations which in a cour&s;e of many years, and in a &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of great employments, he was enabled to confer on &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people in the kingdom, had attach|ed a great number to his fortunes, and formed an intere&s;t in the parliament and the nation, which it was extremely dif|ficult to overturn, or even to &s;hake. He came to be con&s;i|dered as the head of the whigs; and he was in reality well qualified in many re&s;pects for the chief of a party, from his unbounded liberality, from his affability, magnificence, and per&s;onal di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Even the defects and faults, which might have appeared in his character, were rather of &s;ervice to him, as they often tended to &s;often re&s;entments, and helped to give that great power, of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, an appearance le&s;s formidable.</P>
<P>During a great part of the late king's reign, his family had directed all things without controul. On the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, his &s;ituation &s;eemed more doubtful. But in a little time he appeared outwardly as well e&s;tabli&s;hed as ever, not only in his former high employments, but in that &s;hare of influence which is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to at|tend it. There was, however, very little reality in this &s;pe|cious appearance; for he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the royal confi|dence, upon which all the e&s;&s;ential of power depends. Nei|ther his age, nor his &s;ituation in the former reign, had al|lowed him the opportunity of cultivating an intere&s;t with the pre&s;ent king. Another noble per&s;on 

<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Bute.</NOTE>

 had been in an employment near his per&s;on; and having formed his mind with much attention and &s;ucce&s;s to tho&s;e virtues which adorn his &s;tation, de&s;erved and obtained a very uncommon &s;hare of his confidence.</P>
<P>This nobleman was fir&s;t groom of the &s;tole: afterwards, taking a more open &s;hare in the conduct of affairs, he accept|ed the &s;eals as &s;ecretary of &s;tate. On the removal of Mr. Pitt, who pre&s;erved a &s;ort of union in the admini&s;tration by their common dread of him, the only competition was be|tween the duke of Newca&s;tle and lord Bute. The former could not well endure that decay of influence, which, on a thou&s;and occa&s;ions, he mu&s;t have &s;en&s;ibly felt, and which
<PB N="527" REF="595">
the great rank he held mu&s;t have rendered only more pain|ful. Lord Bute, on the other hand, could not bear to &s;ee the trea&s;ury board, which, under whatever limitations, was attended with &s;o much power, in the hands of his rival. It is indeed a department, the entire conduct of which is ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to the per&s;on who has any preten&s;ions to be at the head of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles &s;oon produced their natural effect. In a &s;hort time the duke of Newca&s;tle thought him|&s;elf obliged to re&s;ign,

 <MILESTONE N="May 26."> 

 and lord Bute became fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury. This re&s;ignation was followed by that of others of great con&s;ideration for their rank and influence. No one was &s;urpri&s;ed at the ferment which en&s;ued; in which per&s;onal re&s;entment, party violence, and national, or rather local prejudices, were all united, to throw every thing into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this condition of parties, a number of tho&s;e called Whigs, who had lo&s;t their places, being highly irritated at the late changes, and even many of tho&s;e who &s;till continu|ed in employments, being &s;uppo&s;ed attached to the intere&s;t of the duke of Newca&s;tle, and therefore not to be depended on by the new admini&s;tration, it became nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e called Tories, or country gentlemen.</P>
<P>From the beginning of this reign it had been profe&s;&s;ed, with the general applau&s;e of all good men, to aboli&s;h tho&s;e odious party di&s;tinctions, and to extend the royal favour and protection equally to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. The per|&s;ons called Tories had, be&s;ides, been before active in &s;up|port of &s;ome of tho&s;e, who now clamoured at the very mea|&s;ures which they had them&s;elves, more than once, adopted. However, occa&s;ion was taken from thence to endeavour at the revival of this almo&s;t exploded di&s;tinction. There were great heats, which were blown into a combu&s;tion by every art, and every in&s;trument of party, that had ever proved effectual upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the nation was thus di&s;tracted, the conduct of a war became difficult; its continuance un&s;afe; and its &s;up|plies uncertain. If the admini&s;tration failed, their failure would be con&s;trued into incapacity; if they &s;ucceeded, their &s;ucce&s;s would be converted into an argument for &s;uch terms of peace, as it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to procure. Above all, the antient and known connection between the chiefs of the moneyed intere&s;t and the principal per&s;ons in
<PB N="528" REF="596">
the oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t have been a &s;ubject of great anxiety to the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es co-operated to render the intentions of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try towards peace altogether cordial and &s;in|cere; and they thought them&s;elves abundantly ju&s;tified in their wi&s;hes for it at this juncture, both from the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and the burthens of the nation; from the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of &s;ome of their allies, and the doubtful &s;tate of others; and in general, from tho&s;e arguments of humanity, which made it high time that Europe &s;hould enjoy &s;ome interval of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Both courts thus concurring in the &s;ame point, all diffi|culties were &s;peedily &s;moothed. It is &s;aid, that the fir&s;t over|tures were made under the mediation of his Sardinian ma|je&s;ty. As &s;oon as terms were propo&s;ed, in order to give a pledge to each other of their mutual &s;incerity, it was agreed that this treaty &s;hould not be negotiated, as the former had been, by &s;ubordinate per&s;ons; but that the two courts &s;hould reciprocally &s;end to London and Ver&s;ailles a per&s;on of the fir&s;t con&s;equence and di&s;tinction in either kingdom. Accordingly the duke of Bedford was &s;ent to negotiate on the part of England, and the duke de Nivernois on that of France; the great outlines of the treaty were very &s;oon ex|plained and adju&s;ted. The detail of &s;ome articles took up more time.</P>
<P>During this mixed interval of war and treaty, the French obtained a temporary advantage; but which neither &s;u&s;|pended nor influenced the negotiation. It was the la&s;t of|fen&s;ive effort, which they made; and though this enter|prize was attended with a temporary &s;ucce&s;s in the execu|tion, it was in the de&s;ign not &s;uperior to any of tho&s;e that had failed. Mon&s;ieur de Ternay, with a &s;quadron of four men of war and a bomb ketch, and M. d' Hau&s;onville, with a proportionable number of land forces, arrived the 24th of June at the bay of Bulls in Newfoundland, and finding the i&s;land little prepared to re&s;i&s;t them, took without difficulty, the forts of St. John, Trinity; and Carbonear, de&s;troyed the two la&s;t, and likewi&s;e the &s;tages and implements of the fi&s;h|ery, to a con&s;iderable value. The immen&s;e extent of our military operations, rendered it little wonderful or blame|able, that this particular part was found weak.</P>
<P>The French pre&s;umed by far too much on the &s;upine|ne&s;s of the nation, when they hoped &s;uch an advantage
<PB N="529" REF="597">
could have any great effect on the negotiation. In fact, as &s;oon as the news arrived in England, a force was fitted out to retake tho&s;e places. But &s;uch was the vigilance and rea|dine&s;s of general Amher&s;t; our commander in America, that it &s;uper&s;eded the nece&s;&s;ity of this armament. He de|tached colonel Amher&s;t with a body of forces, and Lord Colville with a &s;mall, but &s;ufficient &s;quadron, to recover this valuable i&s;land. The land forces attacked &s;ome detach|ments of the French, advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in the neigh|bourhood of St. John's, and prepared to attack St. John's it&s;elf, with &s;o much vigour and activity, that M. d'Hau&s;on|ville, who had remained there as governor, thought pro|per to deliver up that place, and &s;urrendered him|&s;elf and garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war

<HEAD>Colonel Amher&s;t's Letter to the Earl of Egremont, dated, St. John's, Newfoundland, <DATE>Sept <HI>20, 1762.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the orders I received from Sir <HI>Jeffery Amher&s;t,</HI> at <HI>New York,</HI> of which your Lord&s;hip have been informed, I proceeded from <HI>New York</HI> to <HI>Halifax</HI> with the tran&s;ports, to take up there the troops de&s;tined for the expedition. I got into the harbour the 26th of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and finding Ld. <HI>Colville</HI> had &s;ailed, determined to embark the troops there, and at <HI>Loui&s;|bourg,</HI> as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, and proceed after his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The men of war being &s;ailed, who were to have taken part of the troops on board, I was obliged to take up &s;hipping to the amount of 400 tons.</P>
<P>I had every thing embarked, ready to &s;ail the 29th, but con|trary winds kept us in the harbour till the 1&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> when we got out, and arrived at <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> on the 5th. The next day the troops were embarked, and we &s;ailed out of the harbour the 7th in the morning.</P>
<P>I had the good fortune to join Lord <HI>Colville</HI>'s fleet on the 11th, a few leagues to the &s;outhward of St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and by the intelli|gence his Lord&s;hip had received, I was obliged to change my re|&s;olution of landing the troops at <HI>Kitty Vitty,</HI> a narrow entrance, clo&s;e to the harbour of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, the enemy having entirely &s;topped up the pa&s;&s;age, by &s;inking &s;hallops in the channel.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I could get, it appeared that <HI>Torbay,</HI> about three leagues to the northward of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, was the place to land the troops at, within that di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Colville</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Syren</HI> man of war into <HI>Torbay</HI> with the tran&s;ports; and it was late at night on the 12th, before they all came to an anchor. Capt. <HI>Douglas</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip <HI>Syren,</HI> went with me to view the Bay, and we found a very good Beach to land on. It blew hard in the night, and one of the tran&s;ports, with the Provincial Light Infantry corps on board, was driven out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>I landed the troops early the next morning, at the bottom of the Bay, from whence a path led to St. <HI>John</HI>'s; a party of the enemy fired &s;ome &s;hots at the boats as they rowed in. The Light Infantry of the Regulars landed fir&s;t, gave the enemy one fire, and drove them towards St. <HI>John</HI>'s. The battalions landed, and we marched on. The path for four miles very narrow, through a thick wood, and over very bad ground.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>M'Donnell</HI>'s Light Infantry corps in front came up with &s;ome of the party we drove from the Landing Place: They had concealed them&s;elves in the wood, fired upon us, and wounded three men. A part of <HI>M'Donnell</HI>'s corps ru&s;hed in upon them, took three pri&s;oners, and drove the re&s;t off.</P>
<P>The country opened afterwards, and we marched to the left of <HI>Kitty Vitty:</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this pa&s;s, to open a communication for the landing of artillery and &s;tores, it being impracticable to get them up the way we came.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our right was clo&s;e to <HI>Kitty Vitty</HI> river, the enemy fired upon us from a hill on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. I &s;ent a party up a rock, which commanded the pa&s;&s;age over, and under cover of their fire, the Light Infantry companies of the Royal and <HI>Mont|gomery</HI>'s, &s;upported by the grenadiers of the Royal, pa&s;&s;ed, drove the enemy up the hill, and pur&s;ued them on that &s;ide towards St. <HI>John</HI>'s: when I perceived a body of the enemy coming to their &s;upport, I immediately ordered over Major <HI>Sutherland,</HI> with the remainder of the fir&s;t battalion, upon which they thought proper to retreat; and we had ju&s;t time, before dark, to take po&s;t.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Mackenzie,</HI> who commanded <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s Light Infan|try, was dangerou&s;ly wounded. We took ten pri&s;oners; the troops lay this night on their arms.</P>
<P>The next morning, the 14th, we opened the channel, where the enemy had &s;unk the &s;hallops: they had a brea&s;t-work which commanded the entrance, and a battery not quite fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. <HI>Tullikin,</HI> who had met with an accident by a fall, and was left on board, joined me this day; and Capt. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> commanding the artillery, brought round &s;ome light artillery and &s;tores from <HI>Torbay</HI> in the &s;hallops.</P>
<P>The enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two very high and &s;teep hills, one in the front of our advanced po&s;ts, and the other nearer to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, which two hills appeared to command the whole ground from <HI>Kitty Vitty</HI> to St. <HI>John</HI>'s. It was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould proceed on this &s;ide, to &s;ecure effectually the landing at the <HI>Kitty Vitty,</HI> from the fir&s;t hill the enemy fired upon our po&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the 15th, ju&s;t before day-break, I ordered Capt. <HI>M'Don|nell</HI>'s corps of Light Infantry, and the Provincial Light Infantry, &s;upported by our advanced po&s;ts, to march to &s;urpri&s;e the enemy on this hill. Capt. <HI>M'Donnell</HI> pa&s;&s;ed their centries and advanced guards, and was fir&s;t di&s;covered by their main body on the hill, as he came climbing up the rocks near the &s;ummit, which he gained, receiving the enemy's fire. He threw in his fire, and the enemy gave way.</P>
<P>Capt. M'Donnell was wounded; Lieut. Schuyler of his com|pany killed, with three or four men, and eighteen wounded.</P>
<P>The enemy had three companies of grenadiers and two picquets at this po&s;t, commanded by Lieut. Col. Belcombe, &s;econd in command, who was wounded; a Captain of Grenadiers wounded and taken pri&s;oner; his Lieut. killed, &s;everal men killed and wounded, and 13 taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The enemy had one mortar here, with which they threw &s;ome &s;hells at us in the night: a &s;ix-pounder not mounted, and two wall pieces.</P>
<P>This hill, with one adjoining, commands the harbour,</P>
<P>The 16th, we advanced to the hill nearer St. <HI>John</HI>'s, which the enemy had quitted. Twenty-nine &s;hallops came in to day with artillery and &s;tores, provi&s;ion and camp equipage from Tor|bay, which we unloaded. I moved the remainder of the troops forward, leaving a po&s;t to guard the pa&s;s of <HI>Kitty Vitty,</HI> on the other &s;ide. La&s;t night the enemy's fleet got out of the harbour. This night we lay on our arms.</P>
<P>The 17th, a mortar battery was compleated, and a battery be|gun for four 24-pounders, and two 12-pounders, about 500 yards from the fort, made the road from the landing for the artillery, and at night opened the mortar battery, with one eight inch mor|tar, and &s;even cohorns, and &s;ix royals. The enemy fired pretty bri&s;kly from the fort and threw &s;ome &s;hells.</P>
<P>The 18th, in the morning, I received a letter from Count <HI>de Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;onville,</HI> of which I do my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e to your Lord&s;hip a copy, as al&s;o of my an&s;wer; with copies of other let|ters that pa&s;&s;ed, and of the capitulation.</P>
<P>As Lord <HI>Colville,</HI> at this time, was &s;ome di&s;tance off the coa&s;t, and the wind not permitting his Lord&s;hip to &s;tand in, to honour me with his concurrence in the terms to be given to the garri&s;on, I thought no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in &s;o advanced a &s;ea&s;on, and therefore took upon me to determine it, hoping to meet with his Lord&s;hip's approbation; and he has given me the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure, by entirely approving of everything I have done.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay, my Lord, that every a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire from the fleet, has been given us, Lord <HI>Colville</HI> upon the &s;hort notice he had of our joining him, having laboured to get together all the &s;hallops he could, and with which we were &s;o amply &s;upplied, was a mea&s;ure of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice: and without which our operations mu&s;t have been con&s;iderably retarded.</P>
<P>The indefatigable labour and per&s;evering ardour of the troops I have the honour to command, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary towards compleating the conque&s;t, before the bad &s;ea&s;on &s;et in, did indeed exceed what I could have expected.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the honour of &s;ending you an account of my proceedings until the 18th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> by a ve&s;&s;el which &s;ailed from <HI>Placen|tia</HI> for <HI>England</HI> at that time; and on the 22d I &s;ailed with his maje&s;ty's &s;hips the <HI>Northumberland, Antelope, Go&s;port</HI> and <HI>Syren,</HI> and the <HI>King George,</HI> belonging to the province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s Bay. On the 25th, we cha&s;ed a &s;chooner off St. <HI>John</HI>'s and took her clo&s;e to the harbour's mouth. She had been an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> priva|teer, taken by the enemy, had eight carriage guns mounted, and was manned with thirty <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> commanded by an en&s;ign <HI>de Vai&s;&s;eau.</HI></P>
<P>The enemy had &s;ent away great part of the inhabitants of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, men, women, and children, by giving them ve&s;&s;els and provi&s;ions to carry them where they plea&s;ed; two of the&s;e, a &s;loop and a &s;chooner, we met with on the coa&s;t, and took twenty-three <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> that were &s;ingle men out of them, to replace in part the marines of the &s;quadron that were left in garri&s;on at <HI>Placentia</HI> and the i&s;le of <HI>Boys.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> &s;aid, that if I would go into the bay of <HI>Bulls,</HI> numbers of their countrymen would re&s;ort to me and enter on board the &s;quadron; but during two days which I &s;tayed in that bay, not a man joined me. The few inhabitants that remained there, quietly followed their bu&s;ine&s;s of fi&s;hing, and 'tis po&s;&s;ible the enemy prevented any others at St. <HI>John</HI>'s from coming.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Davis,</HI> two of the principal inhabitants of <HI>Harbour Grace</HI> and <HI>Carbonera,</HI> in <HI>Conception Bay</HI> having acquaint|ed me that a number of men in their neighbourhood were willing to &s;erve in the &s;quadron during the pre&s;ent exigency, I &s;ent the armed &s;chooner for them, and &s;he returned with fifty men, which I have di&s;tributed among the &s;hips. And the &s;ame gentlemen re|pre&s;enting, that the enemy &s;ometimes &s;ends &s;mall parties by land to <HI>Portugal Cove,</HI> which have threatened to mole&s;t them in &s;hal|lops from that place, de&s;ired, in behalf of them&s;elves and all their neighbours, that the &s;chooner might be &s;tationed in <HI>Conception Bay.</HI> for their protection and defence, which reque&s;t I complied with.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Carbonera, in Conception Bay, has had no other garri&s;on for many years but a few old men of the artillery, to take care of the guns and ordnance &s;tores. Had &s;ome of the in|habitants of the adjacent coa&s;t taken po&s;t here, they might ea&s;ily have defended it again&s;t any force, except one narrow landing place, and no &s;afe road in the neighbourhood for great &s;hips; but the enemy landed in boats, and de&s;troyed the whole without re|&s;i&s;tance. And the i&s;le of <HI>Boys,</HI> near <HI>Ferryland,</HI> would probably have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had it not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in due time by the <HI>Syren</HI>'s marines.</P>
<P>In frequently pa&s;&s;ing the harbour's mouth of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, we could plainly &s;ee that the fort, which fronts the entrance, was fortifyed all round the new works; and that a redoubt, or &s;ome|thing like one, was rai&s;ed at the little harbour of <HI>Kitty Vitty.</HI> The old battery at the South-&s;ide of the harbour's mouth was re|paired with additional works, and a new one erected on the &s;ame &s;ide nearer the entrance. All the&s;e were to be &s;een from the &s;ea; and I could not learn that the enemy intended any thing more than the fini&s;hing the&s;e works.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>September</HI> I received by a &s;loop expre&s;s from <HI>Halifax,</HI> letters from Sir <HI>Jeffery Amher&s;t</HI> at <HI>New York,</HI> acquaint|ing me, that he had come to a re&s;olution to &s;end a body of troops, in order to di&s;lodge the enemy as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible from St. <HI>John</HI>'s; and that Lieut, Col. <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> was to command the&s;e troops. The &s;ame conveyance brought me letters from Col. <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> acquaint|ing me with his arrival at Halifax on the 26th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> his departure from thence on the fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> and with his in|tention to call at <HI>Louisbourg</HI> for the troops there, and then proceed round Cape Race, to join me on this coa&s;t. Upon receipt of the&s;e letters, I &s;ent the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oop which brought them to look out for Col. <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> and the tran&s;ports off <HI>Cape Race;</HI> and in order to join them the &s;ooner, to concert mea&s;ures for the en&s;uing operations, before the enemy could have notice of their arrival, I dropped down with the &s;quadron to <HI>Cape Broyle,</HI> but Mr. <HI>Gili,</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s who had been &s;ent out of the town in a cartel &s;chooner two days before, &s;ending off advice from <HI>Ferryland,</HI> that he was &s;ure the enemy intended to &s;ail in a very little time, I returned with the &s;quadron to our &s;tation off St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P>On the 11th we were joined by Col. <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> with the troops in ten tran&s;port ve&s;&s;els; and I propo&s;ed <HI>Torbay</HI> as the propere&s;t place to land at: It is to the northward of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, about &s;even miles by land, and the roads pretty good, but the bay is not reck|oned &s;afe anchorage, being open to the ea&s;terly winds, which u&s;u|ally begin to prevail at this &s;ea&s;on. By one of the tran&s;ports from <HI>New York,</HI> I received a duplicate, the original not yet come to hand, of their Lord&s;hip's order of the 7th of <HI>June,</HI> directing me to repair my&s;elf, or &s;end a &s;ufficient force to enable Capt. <HI>Graves</HI> of the <HI>Antelope,</HI> to defeat the de&s;igns of the &s;quadron commanded by M. <HI>de Ternay.</HI></P>
<P>On the 12th we proceeded to Torbay. I &s;ent capt. Douglas in the <HI>Syren</HI> to anchor with the tran&s;ports, accompanied by the boats of the &s;quadron, and a number of &s;hallops, or fi&s;hing boats, which I had collected from different parts for the king's &s;ervice. With the re&s;t of the &s;hips I returned to my &s;tation clo&s;e to St. <HI>John</HI>'s harbour. Next morning Col. <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> landed with the troops in the head of the bay, having only four men wounded from a di&s;|tant bu&s;h-firing of the enemy. He marched directly to <HI>Kitty Vitty,</HI> and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that important po&s;t in the evening, without having a man killed, and only two or three wounded. Every thing belonging to the army was carried from Torbay to <HI>Kitty Vitty</HI> in &s;hallops, e&s;corted by boats from the &s;quadron. And this &s;ervice was conducted with diligence and care, by Mr. <HI>Dug|dale,</HI> my fir&s;t Lieutennant, Capt. <HI>Douglas</HI> having joined the &s;quadron again. The enemy's fleet was to have &s;ailed the morn|ing I pa&s;&s;ed the harbour with the tran&s;ports; and 300 men only were to be left in St. <HI>John</HI>'s for the winter; but, upon &s;eeing us, they landed their grenadiers again.</P>
<P>The 15th it blew &s;trong from E. to E. S. E. with thick rainy weather. In the evening the wind &s;hifted to the we&s;tward, light breezes, and thick fog. At &s;ix next morning, it being calm, with a great &s;well, we &s;aw from the ma&s;t-head, but could bring them down no lower than half way the topma&s;t &s;hrouds, four &s;ail, bear|ing S. S. E. di&s;tant &s;even Ieagues; the mouth of St. <HI>John</HI>'s har|bour at the &s;ame time bore W. four leagues. We lo&s;t &s;ight of them about &s;even, though very clear; and &s;ome time after, a &s;mall breeze &s;pringing up in the S. W. quarter, I &s;tood in towards <HI>Torbay,</HI> in order to cover the &s;hallops that might by going from thence to <HI>Kitty Vitty.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon I received a note from Col. <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> acquaint|ing me that the <HI>French</HI> fleet got out la&s;t night. Thus, after being blocked up in St. <HI>John</HI>'s harbour for three weeks by a &s;quadron of equal number, but &s;maller &s;hips, with fewer guns and men, did M. <HI>Ternay</HI> make his e&s;cape in the night by a &s;hameful flight. I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that not a man in the &s;quadron imagined the four &s;ail, when we &s;aw them, where the enemy; and the pi|lots were of opinion, that they mu&s;t have had the wind much &s;tronger than with us, to overcome the we&s;terly &s;well in the har|bour's mouth. I &s;ent the <HI>King George</HI> round <HI>Cape Race,</HI> as far as <HI>Trepa&s;&s;y,</HI> to bring me intelligence if the enemy &s;hould &s;teer to|wards <HI>Placentia;</HI> and I directed Capt. <HI>Douglas</HI> of the <HI>Syren</HI> to get the tran&s;ports moved from <HI>Torbay</HI> as a very un&s;afe road to the bay of <HI>Bulls.</HI></P>
<P>A bomb battery was opened again&s;t the fort, in the night of the 17th, and next day it capitulated, before any other battery began to play.</P>
<P>The &s;quadron got into the harbour ye&s;terday morning; and in the evening I received their Lord&s;hips order of the 3d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> &s;ent me by capt. <HI>Palli&s;er</HI> of the <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> who, with the <HI>Su|perbe, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> had ju&s;t arrived on the coa&s;t. I have directed capt. <HI>Palli&s;er,</HI> with the other &s;hips, to come into the harbour, as &s;oon as a convenient opportunity offers for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>We have about eight hundred pri&s;oners, grenadiers, picquets, and &s;ome marines, being a very fine body of men, and nearly equal in number to the regulars of our army. I am now preparing tran&s;ports to carry them to <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The enemy did not intend to leave &s;o great a part of their force here; their grenadiers were ready for embarking, but M. <HI>de Ter|nay</HI> &s;eemed determined at all events to gra&s;p an opportunity, which, if once lo&s;t, might never be regained; therefore, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, he left behind his grenadiers, anchors, and turned his boats a drift when they had towed him out. The fog was &s;o thick that Lieut. Col. Tullikin, who was po&s;ted on an eminence in the narrowe&s;t part of the harbour's mouth, could hear their noi&s;e, but could not di&s;cern any of their &s;hips. The fog even altered the direction of the &s;ound, which &s;eemed to come from another part of the harbour, whil&s;t they mu&s;t have been di|rectly under him.</P>
<P>There is a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ions and other goods at this place, collected and tumbled promi&s;cuou&s;ly into different &s;torehou&s;es by the enemy. Many of the Iri&s;h &s;ervants have al&s;o been robbing and plundering their ma&s;ters. To a&s;certain proper|ty, in order to make re&s;titution as far as can be, and to re&s;tore re|gularity to a country, &s;o long di&s;tracted by being in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, will be the particular care of governor Graves, who, in my opinion, is well qualified for &s;uch an office; and as he will &s;tay here, he will be able, in a great mea&s;ure, to re&s;tore the affairs of this country.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Douglas</HI> of the <HI>Syren</HI> has behaved with &s;pirit and activity, and exerted every talent of a good officer during this expedition; and (without adding any more officers to the corps) I am happy in the opportunity of &s;ending him to wait on their lord&s;hips.</P>

lord Colville could arrive from the place where the troops had been landed, to co-operate with them. M. de Ternay e&s;caped with the fleet, partly by having gained a con&s;idera|ble

di&s;tance, before they were di&s;covered, by means of a thick fog; and partly becau&s;e lord Colville, after their hav|ing been di&s;covered, did not apprehend that they really were the enemy's &s;hips.</P>

The body under the mar&s;hal d'E&s;trees and Soubi&s;e, being &s;treightened, in the manner we have &s;een, by the in|comparable judgment of prince Ferdinand's mea&s;ures, had
<PB N="534" REF="602">
been obliged to call that under the prince of Conde from the Lower Rhine to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In order to complete their junction with this corps, the grand army uncovered

Ca&s;&s;el, quitted the banks of the Fulda, and fell back to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, who had attended this corps all along, thought at length a

fair opportunity had occurred of &s;triking a deci&s;ive blow again&s;t it.

 With this aid he attacked, with his u&s;ual vivacity, that part of the French army,
<PB N="537" REF="605">

of his troops. He drove the enemy intirely from the high grounds into the plain; but whil&s;t he pur&s;ued his advantage, the body he attacked was reinforced by the main army. The action which began &s;o favourable for the allies, ended in a defeat. They lo&s;t above three thou&s;and men in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners. The hereditary prince, who had, through the whole action, made the mo&s;t powerful efforts, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the greate&s;t dangers, received a wound from a mu&s;ket-ball in his hip-bone, from which his life was a long time doubtful, and his recovery lingering and tedious. Whil&s;t his life continued in danger, the con|cern was unu&s;ual, and common to both armies; both taking an intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of a prince, as much endear|ed by his humanity, as admired for his valour and military genuis.</P>
<P>A victory of the greate&s;t importance could not have more fully di&s;played the &s;uperiority of prince Ferdinand's capaci|ty, in the conduct of a war, than his mea&s;ures after this de|feat. The French were not &s;uffered to derive the &s;malle&s;t
<PB N="539" REF="609">
advantage from their victory; nor did the allies lo&s;e a foot of ground. The communication with Ca&s;&s;el was &s;till at the mercy of the allies. The French, in their retreat, had thrown a garri&s;on of ten thou&s;and men in that place; and the prince made immediate and vigorous preparations to be&s;iege it.</P>
<P>When the prince had adju&s;ted his army to cover the &s;iege the French took advantage of his movement for that purpo&s;e, to repa&s;s the Lahan near Gie&s;&s;en, and advanced towards Marpurg. But as they advanced, the prince drew his army from the &s;iege, and made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as ena|bled him to fall at once upon their flank and rear, drove them from all their po&s;ts,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 26."> 

 and obliged them once more to fly with precipitation behind the Lahne.</P>
<P>After this &s;ucce&s;sful affair, the body of the army re&s;umed their preparations for the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, which was now be|come the grand object of the campaign; and the great pur|po&s;e of the endeavours of both armies was, of the one to open the communication with Ca&s;&s;el, of the other to cut it off.</P>
<P>A number of &s;kirmi&s;hes happened in the&s;e movements. The mo&s;t remarkable among them was the af|fair of Bucker Muhl,

 <MILESTONE N="Sept. 30."> 

 not &s;o much for the con&s;e|quences, which were not extraordinary, but for the uncommon &s;teadine&s;s of the two parties engaged. It was a po&s;t of &s;ome moment, the forcing of which would fa|cilitate to the French the reduction of Amonebourg, a &s;mall fortre&s;s, but of importance, as it commanded a pa&s;s which led into the country which they propo&s;ed to enter. This po&s;t was nothing more than a bridge over the Ohme, defended by a &s;light redoubt on one &s;ide, and by a mill on the other. The allies had no cover, except the redoubt; nor the French, except the mill. The engagement began at fir&s;t between two &s;mall bodies, and an artillery proporti|onably &s;mall; but as the action warmed, the artillery was gradually augmented, until it amounted to about five and twenty heavy cannon on each &s;ide. The allies had originally but one hundred men in this po&s;t; but before the bu&s;ine&s;s ended, &s;eventeen complete battalions were engaged, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively relieved each other, after each detachment had made &s;ixty di&s;charges. The artillery fired at a di&s;tance of three hundred paces, and the mu&s;quetry at thirty. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="540" REF="610">
the allied troops, as they pa&s;&s;ed to and from the redoubt, were, for a length of four hundred paces, expo&s;ed to all the enemy's cannon loaded with grape &s;hot.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the French was nearly the &s;ame. A dreadful fire was &s;upported between the&s;e re&s;olute bodies, without a moments intermi&s;&s;ion, or the lea&s;t &s;lackening on one &s;ide or the other, for near fifteen hours, from the dawn of day to dark night. Neither &s;ide gave way; and this mo&s;t bloody conte&s;t for a mo&s;t trifling object in the end left the allies in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their redoubt, and the French of their mill. The whole compa&s;s of military hi&s;tory furni&s;hes no in&s;tance of &s;o ob&s;tinate a di&s;pute. The allies lo&s;t &s;ix hun|dred men in killed and wounded; towards the clo&s;e of the day, the dead bodies &s;erved to rai&s;e a parapet for the re|doubt, in the place of that which had been beat to pieces by the cannonade.</P>
<P>The French are thought to have &s;uffered more in this action than the allies. However, though they did not &s;uc|ceed in their attack upon the bridge, they battered at the &s;ame time the ca&s;tle of Amonebourg with &s;o much fury, that in a &s;hort time they effected a breach, and obliged the gar|ri&s;on to &s;urrender. By this advantage they gained a good deal of ground, and even got on the rear of the allied army. But with this advantage, con&s;iderable as it was, they were able to do nothing deci&s;ive: they were able neither to rai&s;e, nor materially to di&s;turb the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, which went on without interruption; nor where they able to throw the lea&s;t relief into this place, where their garri&s;on already began to &s;uffer for want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>This capital of an unfortunate principality, which has &s;o often been taken and retaken during the cour&s;e of this war, di&s;pairing of relief, at length &s;urrendered to the victorious arms of the allies,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 1."> 

 after a &s;iege of fif|teen days open trenches. The garri&s;on made an honourable capitulation. And now prince Ferdinand might con&s;ider him&s;elf as ma&s;ter of He&s;&s;e, no place of &s;trength in that country remaining in the enemy's hands, except Zie|genhayn. Advanced as the &s;ea&s;on was, the prince prepared to lay &s;iege to that fortre&s;s; and as he was now able to draw down his whole army into that quarter, there was no que&s;|tion but he would have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place
<PB N="541" REF="611">
without any difficulty. But the &s;igning of the pre|liminaries of peace,

 <MILESTONE N="Nov. 15."> 

 at this time notified in the two armies, put an happy conclu&s;ion to all milita|ry operations.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries had very little to do towards com|pleting the relief of our allies; except that they &s;et the &s;eal on their good fortune, and prevented their being expo&s;ed any longer to the chances of war. This campaign, though it was not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any great deci&s;ive victory, was not the le&s;s honourable to the commander or the troops. A connected &s;eries of judicious and &s;pirited operations produced all the effects which could be propo&s;ed from a &s;ingle and brilliant &s;troke. At this period, the French, after having for &s;ix years exerted almo&s;t the whole undivided &s;trength of their monarchy upon this &s;ingle object, were, in the end, very little more advanced than they were the day they fir&s;t &s;et their foot in Germany. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of three or four poor unimportant places was all they had purcha&s;ed by ma|ny millions of trea&s;ure expended, and po&s;&s;ibly near two hun|dred thou&s;and lives thrown away.</P>
<P>The whole body of the allies acquired great and ju&s;t glo|ry in this war; but the Engli&s;h had all along the po&s;t of ho|nour, and obtained the highe&s;t reputation. As to their com|mander the duke of Brun&s;wick, having begun his operati|ons almo&s;t without an army, having continued the war with an army always inferior in numbers, having experienced every variety of fortune, his capacity and his firmne&s;s carri|ed him with credit through all; and enabled him to con|clude the war with a triumphant &s;uperiority. He may now enjoy in the honourable repo&s;e which his exploits have purcha&s;ed for him&s;elf and his country, the be&s;t of rewards, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of public &s;ervice. Po&s;terity will con&s;ider him as the deliverer of Germany.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h troops, after &s;o many fatigues and dangers, at length enjoyed the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy return to their country; but a general damp was ca&s;t &s;uddenly on their joy by the illne&s;s of lord Granby; who was attacked by a very dangerous and long continued fever,

<P>"The&s;e &s;entiments naturally call for his utmo&s;t acknowledg|ments; he therefore returns his warme&s;t thanks to the generals, officers, and private men, compo&s;ing the whole Briti&s;h corps, for the bravery, zeal, di&s;cipline, and good conduct he has con&s;tantly experienced from every individual; and his mo&s;t particular and per&s;onal thanks are due to them for their ready obedience, upon all occa&s;ions to &s;uch orders as his &s;tation obliged him to give.</P>
<P>"His be&s;t endeavours have always been directed to their good, by every means in his power; and he has the &s;atisfaction to think he has &s;ome rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf of their being convinced, if not of the efficacy, at lea&s;t of the &s;incerity of his intentions, if he may judge by the noble return their behaviour has made him; a behaviour, that while it fills him with gratitude, has endeared them to their king and country, and has covered them with glory and honour.</P>
<P>"Highly &s;en&s;ible of their merit, he &s;hall continue, while he lives, to look upon it as much his duty, as it will for ever be his inclina|tions, to give them every po&s;&s;ible proof of his affection and e&s;teem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he &s;hould be happy to make as apparent as their valour has been, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> exemplary to after ages."</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>

 It is impo&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="542" REF="612">
to expre&s;s the concern of the whole army during this anxious interval, or the joy which enlivened every brea&s;t on his recovery. No commander had ever been more di&s;|tingui&s;hed for an enterpri&s;ing and generous courage; and none half &s;o much for an unlimitted benevolence. The &s;ick and wounded &s;oldier, the officer who&s;e income was unequal to his rank or his nece&s;&s;ities, in him found a never failing and never burthen&s;ome re&s;ource. Whatever could be done to animate the &s;oldiery, to make them chearful in the &s;er|vice, to alleviate the hard&s;hips of war, was exerted beyond what could be thought po&s;&s;ible in the limits of a private for|tune; and the &s;atisfaction of the giver went always be|yond the actual benefit, becau&s;e in his greate&s;t liberality, it was evident that he wi&s;hed to do a thou&s;and times more. By his whole conduct he in&s;pired foreigners with a favoura|ble idea of the Engli&s;h nobility. His character is, indeed, &s;uch as we are apt, in romantic ideas, fondly to conceive of our old Engli&s;h barons. It is with plea&s;ure we attempt,
<PB N="543" REF="613">
however feebly, to do ju&s;tice to the merit of tho&s;e men, living or dead, who, in this memorable war, have contri|buted to rai&s;e this country to a pitch of glory, in which it has not been exceeded by any other in antient or modern times. Future hi&s;tory will pay them a reward more ade|quate to their merits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Siege and &s;urrender of Schweidnitz. War transferred to Saxony. Au&s;trians defeated at Freyberg. Pru&s;&s;ians ra|vage the Empire. Preliminaries of peace between Great Britain and France. Di&s;putes concerning them. Mr. Fox comes into admini&s;tration. Preliminaries approved by par|liament. Peace of Hubert&s;bourg between Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia. Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILST the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles Were making &s;o con&s;iderable a progre&s;s towards peace, tho&s;e of Vienna and Berlin &s;eemed to remit nothing of their antient animo&s;ity. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, deprived of the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, but at the &s;ame time freed from the ho&s;tilities of the Ru&s;&s;ians directed his whole force and attention towards the &s;ingle object of driving the Au&s;trians out of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>Prince Henry, who commanded in Saxony, contented him&s;elf with acting upon the defen&s;ive. The king in per|&s;on carried on the &s;iege of Schweidnitz, almo&s;t in the pre|&s;ence of mar&s;hal Daun, who &s;carce made any attempts to re|lieve it. But whatever deficiency there might have been in the &s;pirit of the grand army of the Au&s;trians, it was am|ply compen&s;ated by the ob&s;tinate bravery of the garri&s;on, which re&s;i&s;ted all the attacks of the Pru&s;&s;ians for near two months from the opening of the trenches. It is &s;aid that the attack was conducted, and the defence made, by two en|gineers, who had written on the &s;ubject of the attack and defence of places; and they were now practically engaged to prove the &s;uperiority of their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>However this may be, Schweidnitz co&s;t the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia a great deal of time, many laborious efforts, and a num|ber of men. The brave garri&s;on, to the number of eight thou&s;and men,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 9."> 

 were at length obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. Their ill fortune pur|&s;ued them every where. A great part of this body of gal|lant

<PB N="544" REF="616">
pri&s;oners were drowned at the mouth of the Oder, on their pa&s;&s;age to their intended confinement at Konig&s;berg: only nine men of the whole number e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia now ma&s;ter of Schweidnitz, and con&s;equently of Sile&s;ia, turned his attention to Saxony, where he con&s;iderably reinforced his brother's army and made preparations which indicated a de&s;ign of laying &s;iege to Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>In Saxony al&s;o the Au&s;trians began to exert them&s;elves with great &s;pirit; and made &s;ome progre&s;s under the gene|rals Stolberg, and Haddick. They obtained con&s;iderable advantages, in &s;everal encounters, over the army of prince Henry; and even pu&s;hed them back to Freyberg; the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of which place they prepared to di&s;pute with the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>But here fortune, which has &s;eldom proved long con&s;tant to their arms, entirely for&s;ook them. The united army of Imperali&s;ts and Au&s;trians was attacked by prince Henry,

 <MILESTONE N="Oct. 29."> 

 (who took advantage of the ab&s;ence of general Haddick,) in the neighbourhood of Freyberg, and totally routed. Great numbers were &s;lain. The Pru&s;&s;ians took near &s;ix thou&s;and pri&s;oners, among whom were about two hundred and forty officers of all ranks, thirty pieces of cannon, and &s;everal &s;tandards. The victory was complete, and, as far as regarded the event of the campaign, deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians attributed this defeat to the treachery of one of their &s;uperior officers, who was &s;oon after taken in|to cu&s;tody. But whil&s;t they were inquiring into the cau&s;e of their di&s;a&s;ter, and preparing to puni&s;h the author of it, the Pru&s;&s;ians were pu&s;hing the advantages which their vic|tory afforded them with all imaginable alacrity. And this they were enabled to do with the greate&s;t effect, by means of a partial ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, which the Au&s;trians were &s;o imprudent as to conclude with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia for Sile&s;ia and the electoral Saxony only, without fore&s;eeing the danger, or providing for the &s;afety, either of their own im|mediate dominions, or of tho&s;e members of the Empire, which were the mo&s;t attached to their intere&s;ts, and which were now expo&s;ed to the attempts of a bold, rapacious, and exa&s;perated enemy.</P>
<P>One body of the Pru&s;&s;ian army broke into Bohemia, pu&s;hed on almo&s;t to the gates of Prague, and de&s;troyed a capital magazine. Another fell upon the &s;ame country on
<PB N="545" REF="617">
another quarter, and laid the town of Egra almo&s;t in a&s;hes, by a bombardment and a cannonade of red hot bullets. Some extended them&s;elves all over Saxony; others pene|trated into the furthe&s;t parts of Franconia, and even as far as Suabia, ravaging the country; exacting the mo&s;t ex|orbitant contributions, and &s;preading di&s;may and confu|&s;ion upon every &s;ide. The dyet of the Empire &s;itting at Rati&s;bon did not think them&s;elves in &s;afety; but were be|ginning to fly and preparing to remove their records.</P>
<P>The free city of Nuremberg, &s;o famous for the inge|nious indu&s;try, and pacific di&s;po&s;ition of its inhabitants, &s;uffered the mo&s;t by this inva&s;ion; having been obliged to pay contribution to the amount of two hundred thou&s;and pounds of our money. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that in this expedition the Pru&s;&s;ians rai&s;ed a &s;um equal to the annual &s;ub&s;idy, which had formerly been paid by Great Britain to their &s;overeign. Many of the &s;tates found them&s;elves ob|bliged to &s;ign a neutrality, in order to &s;ave their territories from further ravages.</P>
<P>And now a great part of the Empire being already in|cluded in the peace between Great Britain and France, and the re&s;t, tied down by this neutrality, entirely di&s;|abled by the late defeat, or exhau&s;ted by the &s;ub&s;equent in|cur&s;ions, were no longer in a condition to furni&s;h an army under the imperial name and authority. After the whole al|liance had been thus gradually di&s;&s;olved, the affair was, at length, left to be decided as it was begun, by the &s;ingle arms of Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia; &s;o that there was great rea&s;on to hope, as the war in Germany had &s;ucceeded immediately to the rupture between Great Britain and France, the peace between the&s;e powers would al&s;o lead to the &s;peedy pacifi|cation of the Empire.</P>
<P>The preliminaries had been &s;igned by the Briti&s;h and French mini&s;ters at Fountainbleau, on the third of No|vember, and it is nece&s;&s;ary for the completion of our de&s;ign, that we &s;hould here give &s;ome account of the definitive treaty which was built upon them.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that, in the negotiation of 1761, it was laid down as a principal by the two courts, that their re&s;pective propo&s;itions, in ca&s;e the treaty &s;hould by any accident be broken off, were to be con&s;idered as re|tracted or never made. At that time we remarked, that the&s;e propo&s;itions would probably have their influence, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="544" REF="618">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="545" REF="619">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="546" REF="620">
this provi&s;ion; becau&s;e, as we then ob&s;erved, things once &s;ettled and agreed to, unavoidably &s;tamp their own impre&s;&s;ion upon any future negotiation relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject. It happened very nearly, as was then fore|&s;een; for, as far as we can judge, the negotiation did not &s;et out upon any new or peculiar principle of its own, but &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ume as a ba&s;is tho&s;e points, which were near|e&s;t to an adju&s;tment in the preceding treaty; and to com|mence where that tran&s;action concluded.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the two negotiations, &s;o far as regarded the peculiar intere&s;t of Great Britain, &s;eems to have been per|fectly &s;imilar. There was &s;carcely any other difference, than that Great Britain, in con&s;equence of her &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;ince that time, acquired more than &s;he then demanded; but &s;till the general idea, on which &s;he acquired, was near|ly or altogether the &s;ame. But with regard to &s;ome of our allies, the principal was greatly varied; and we imagine that this change was &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified by the alteration which happened in the affairs of Germany, during the in|terval between the two treaties. Tho&s;e who conducted the negotiation in 1761, were &s;teady in rejecting every propo|&s;ition, in which they were not left at liberty to aid the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, with the whole force of Great Britain; tho&s;e, who concluded the peace in 1762, paid le&s;s attention to the intere&s;ts, though they did not wholly neglect the &s;afety of that monarch. At the beginning of the year, and before they had entered into the negotiation, they refu&s;ed to renew that article of the annual treaty, by which our court had engaged to conclude no peace without the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; though at the &s;ame time they declared them&s;elves willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with the u&s;ual &s;ub&s;idy. He on his part re|fu&s;ed the &s;ub&s;idy unconnected with that article. Some cold|ne&s;s grew between the two courts from this time forward.</P>
<P>The adju&s;tment of affairs in the Empire, &s;eemed to form no material impediment to the progre&s;s of the treaty. Both parties readily agreed to withdraw them&s;elves totally from the German was. They thought and rightly, that nothing could tend &s;o much to give peace to their re&s;pective allies, as mutually to withdraw their a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them; and to &s;top that current of Engli&s;h and French money, which, as long as it ran into Germany, would be &s;ure to feed a perpetual war in that country.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as affairs then were, this conduct on our
<PB N="547" REF="621">
&s;ide was as defen&s;ible as the conduct which we held in 1761. At that time the affairs of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia were at the lowe&s;t ebb; he was overpowered by the whole weight of Au&s;tria, of Sweden, of the Empire, and of Ru&s;&s;ia, as determined as ever, in her enmity, and then &s;ucce&s;sful; to &s;ay nothing of France. Neither genero&s;ity, nor perhaps &s;ound policy, ought to have permitted us to de&s;ert him in that &s;ituation. But when the la&s;t treaty was made, the con|dition of his affairs was ab&s;olutely rever&s;ed. He had got rid of the mo&s;t powerful, and one of the mo&s;t implacable of his enemies. He had concluded a peace with Sweden. The treaty it&s;elf freed him from all apprehen&s;ions of France. He had then none to contend with, but a nominal army of the Empire, and one of Au&s;tria, which, though &s;omething more than nominal, was wholly unable to oppo&s;e his pro|gre&s;s. His &s;ituation, from being pitiable, was become formi|dable. It was good policy to prevent the ballance of Ger|many from being overturned to his prejudice. It would have been the wor&s;t in the world to overturn it in his favour.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles &s;ufficiently explain and ju&s;tify the dif|ferent conduct of this nation, at the&s;e two periods, towards the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The demand of the evacuation of We&s;el, Cleves, and Gueldres, which had been made in the fir&s;t negotiation was then ju&s;tly excepted to, becau&s;e we refu&s;ed to put an end to the German war. In this la&s;t the French agreed to it, and with rea&s;on, becau&s;e we agreed in common with them to be neutral in the di&s;putes of the Empire. And on the&s;e principles, the peace of Germany, &s;o far as it depended on Great Britain and France, was re|&s;tored. The re&s;t of Europe was pacified by the &s;tipulation for the evacuation of Portugal. This was indeed, with regard to the contracting courts, the primary object.</P>
<P>What remained after the concerns of the allies were provided for, was the adju&s;tment of what related to the &s;et|tlements and commerce of Great Britain and the Bourbon courts. The difficulty, which prevented this adju&s;tment in the preceding negotiation, was the intervention of the claims of Spain. The attempts of the Bourbon powers to intermix and confound their affairs in the preceding nego|tiation, had a &s;hare in making the war more general; on this occa&s;ion it had a contrary effect. As the whole was negotiated together, it facilitated the peace, by affording ea&s;ier methods of adju&s;ting the &s;y&s;tem of compen&s;ation, and
<PB N="548" REF="622">
furni&s;hing more largely to the general fund of equavalents.</P>
<P>The great object, and the original cau&s;e of the war, had been the &s;ettlement of limits in America. This was therefore the fir&s;t object to be attended to in the treaty. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this point was much more accurately, as well as beneficially, &s;ettled, than it promi&s;ed to be in the negotiation of the foregoing year. For the French, not having a&s;certained the bounds between their own &s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with great exactne&s;s, than they had tho&s;e be|tween their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and ours, it was not clear in ceding Canada, how much they ceded to us. Di&s;putes might have ari&s;en, and did indeed immediately ari&s;e upon this &s;ubject, be&s;ides, the we&s;tern limits of our &s;outhern conti|nental colonies, were not mentioned. And tho&s;e limits were extremely ob&s;cure and &s;ubject to many di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. Such di&s;cu&s;&s;ions contained in them the &s;eeds of a new war, In the la&s;t treaty it was agreed, that a line drawn along the middle of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, from its &s;ource to the ri|ver Iberville, (a &s;mall but navigable branch of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ip|pi,) and thence along the middle of this river, and the lakes of Maurepas and Pontchartrain, (which lakes communicate with both rivers) to the &s;ea, &s;hould be the bounds of the two nations in North America.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more di&s;tinct than this boundary. It gave us, in addition to what was properly Canada, a very large tract of territory, which the French u&s;ed to include under the name of Loui&s;ania; to which our claims were never clearly a&s;certained, and much le&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed by any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The French have had for a long time forts and &s;ettlements in that country; whereas the Engli&s;h never had either the one or the other; and this is a con&s;ideration of no &s;mall moment in a conte&s;t concering rights in a country &s;uch as America.</P>
<P>What added al&s;o to the rounding of our territories, and cutting off the occa&s;ions of limitary di&s;putes, was the ce&s;|&s;ion of Florida on the part of Spain. This country indeed makes no great figure in the commercial world; and cannot be therefore put in competition with the other conque&s;ts, But from the &s;ituation of its harbours of Pen&s;acola and Mo|bile, it affords &s;ome advantages in the time of peace, and very con&s;iderable ones in time of war; by connecting our fu|ture &s;ettlements on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi with tho&s;e upon the At|lantic ocean, and by enabling us greatly to di&s;tre&s;s, if not
<PB N="549" REF="623">
wholly to de&s;troy the trade of the Spaniards in ca&s;e of a rupture with them. The navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi was made common to both nations.</P>
<P>By the treaty of Utrecht, which &s;ettled our northern limits, and by this treaty which a&s;certained tho&s;e to the we&s;t, our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America are as well defined, as the nature of &s;uch a country can po&s;&s;ibly admit. They com|prehend in their extent the foundation of a va&s;t empire; they have many advantages of &s;oil and climate; and many of intercour&s;e and communication, by the number of noble lakes and navigable rivers, with which that part of the world abounds. The&s;e circum&s;tances afford, though a di|&s;tant, a fair pro&s;pect of commerce to Great Britain, when this immen&s;e country comes to be fully peopled, and pro|perly cultivated. Some advantages al&s;o we derive from this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that are not only con&s;iderable but immediate; among the principal of which mu&s;t be reckoned, the mono|poly of the furr and peltry trade of North America, much the greate&s;t trade of that kind in the world, and which is now, we may &s;ay, entirely in our hands. Be&s;ides the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada enlarged the &s;phere of our fi&s;hery, and took from the French an opportunity of trade, which &s;he might employ greatly to our detriment.</P>
<P>Such are the advantages fairly, and without any exagge|ration, for which we are indebted to this part of the treaty, in which the intere&s;ts of Great Britain were well weighed and &s;olidly provided for.</P>
<P>The next point we &s;hall con&s;ider, is the arangement made concerning the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, This was a point of infinite importance, and a &s;ubject of much con|trover&s;y. In a commercial view it is certainly of great e&s;timation. But it has been con&s;idered as even more ma|terial in a political light. Every body knows that the&s;e ex|ten&s;ive fi&s;heries are the life of many maritime places, which would otherwi&s;e be of no &s;ort of value; that they are the great nur&s;eries of &s;eamen, and con&s;equently the great re|&s;ources of the marine. Scarce any object could be of more importance to two nations, who contended for a &s;uperiority in naval power.</P>
<P>The more clearly therefore it was the intere&s;t of Great Britain, to acquire the exclu&s;ive exerci&s;e of this fi&s;hery, the more &s;trongly and evidently it became the intere&s;t of France to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch a preten&s;ion. Not only a large part of her foreign trade depended on this fi&s;hery, but a
<PB N="550" REF="624">
great part of her dome&s;tic &s;upply. Be&s;ides every hope of the &s;trength and almo&s;t of the exi&s;tence of a naval power, mu&s;t vani&s;h with the ce&s;&s;ion of this fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h admini&s;tration probably &s;aw, that France would rather run all the hazards of war, than totally relin|qui&s;h this object. Since therefore they de&s;paired of driving the French entirely from the fi&s;hery, they endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to dimini&s;h its value to them. In this re|&s;pect they followed the plan of the former negotiation, ex|cept that &s;ome improvements were added.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, that article of the treaty of Utrecht was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which the French were admitted to fi&s;h, and to dry their fi&s;h, on the north-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t parts of Newfoundland, from Cape Bonavi&s;ta to Point Biche, and excluded from the re&s;t of this i&s;land. They were al&s;o permitted to fi&s;h within the Gulph of St. Lawrence, but with this limitation, that they &s;hall not approach within three leagues of any of the coa&s;ts belonging to England.</P>
<P>This precaution was taken, not only with a view of abridging the French fi&s;hery of dry cod, but principally in order to prevent their landing, and on that pretence forming &s;ettlements on tho&s;e exten&s;ive de&s;arts, which &s;urrounded the Gulph of St. Lawrence. Otherwi&s;e this privilege might become a means of exciting new controver&s;ies between the two nations.</P>
<P>In compen&s;ation for the ce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;les of Cape Breton and St. John to England, we agreed to &s;urrender to France the &s;mall i&s;land of St. Pierre and Miquelon, &s;itu|ated to the &s;outh of Newfoundland. The ce&s;&s;ion of the two former i&s;lands was, unque&s;tionably, more than an equi|valent for the two latter, though the latter are by no means either incommodiou&s;ly &s;ituated or ill circum&s;tanced for car|rying on the fi&s;hery. The French &s;tipulated to erect no fortifications on the&s;e i&s;lands, nor to keep more than fifty &s;oldiers to enforce the police. In this in&s;tance the plan of the former negotiation was pur&s;ued. The ideas of a re&s;i|dent commi&s;&s;ary, and the occa&s;ional vi&s;itation by a &s;hip of war were omitted; as regulations, which were in truth more humiliating to France, than in any re&s;pect advantageous to our intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hery was, as it had been at the treaty of Utrecht, divided between France and England, but with le&s;s equali|ty on this than on that occa&s;ion. The French are not
<PB N="551" REF="625">
wholly deprived of their &s;hare; but this &s;hare is con&s;ider|ably impaired. Their lo&s;s of Cape Breton does not appear to be fully &s;upplied by St. Pierre and Miquelon. The con|&s;iderable and growing fi&s;hery, which the French had &s;ettled at Ga&s;pe is taken away without hope of recovery. On the whole, we are thus circum&s;tanced; we have advantages in this fi&s;hery, which we may certainly improve to a great &s;u|periority; but we have &s;till a rival, which makes it nece&s;|&s;ary to exert our&s;elves with unremitting indu&s;try in order to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>With regard to Spain, &s;he entirely <HI>de&s;i&s;ted</HI> from the right &s;he claimed of fi&s;hing on the&s;e coa&s;ts. A more &s;atisfactory expre&s;&s;ion could have been wi&s;hed; if it had been of great importance, in what terms a right was renounced, which for a long time had never been exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the affairs of the We&s;t Indies came to be &s;ettled, though they cau&s;ed great difference of opinion among the publick, they do not &s;eem to have rai&s;ed any great difficulty in the negotiation. We had here made great conque&s;ts, and here al&s;o we made great conce&s;&s;ions. We ceded the Havannah, with a con&s;iderable part of the i&s;land of Cuba; the i&s;lands of Martinico; Gaudeloupe; Mariegalante; De|&s;irade; and Santa Lucia. We retained in our hands the i&s;lands of Tobago, Dominica, St. Vincent, and the Gre|nades. To the three former, of which, (as well as to Santa Lucia, which we &s;urrendered) we had an old claim. The la&s;t only was a new acqui&s;ition; and the three others are at pre&s;ent of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>Many cen&s;ured with great vehemence and a&s;perity this part of the treaty. They in&s;i&s;ted that in this treaty we had lo&s;t &s;ight of that great fundamental principal, that France is chiefly, if not &s;olely, to be dreaded by us in the light of a maritime and commerical power. That therefore we had, by re&s;toring to her all her valuable We&s;t India i&s;|lands, and by our conce&s;&s;ions in the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, left in her hands the means of recovering her prodigious lo&s;&s;es, and of becoming once more formidable to us at &s;ea. That the fi&s;hery trained up an innumerable multitude of young &s;eamen; and that the We&s;t India trade employed them when they were trained. That France had long &s;ince gained a decided &s;uperiority over us in this lucrative branch of commerce, and &s;upplied almo&s;t all Europe with the rich commodities, which are produced only in that part of the
<PB N="552" REF="626">
world. By this commerce, &s;aid they, &s;he enriched her merchants and augmented her finances; whil&s;t from a want of &s;ugar land, which has been long known and &s;evere|ly felt by England, we at once lo&s;t the foreign trade, and &s;uffered all the inconveniences of a monopoly at home.</P>
<P>That, at the clo&s;e of &s;o expen&s;ive a war, we might very rea&s;onably demand &s;omething towards our indemnification, as well as towards our &s;ecurity. It is evident &s;aid they, that our conque&s;ts in North America, however, they may provide for the one, are altogether inadequate to the other of the&s;e ends. The &s;tate of the exi&s;ting trade of the&s;e con|que&s;ts is extremely low; the &s;peculations of their future are precarious, and the pro&s;pect, at the very be&s;t, very re|mote. We &s;tand in need of &s;upplies, which will have an effect, certain, &s;peedy, and con&s;iderable. The retaining both, or even one of the con&s;iderable French i&s;lands, Mar|tinico or Guadeloupe, will, and nothing el&s;e can effectually an&s;wer this tripple purpo&s;e. The advantage is immediate. It is a matter not of conjecture but of account. The trade with the&s;e conque&s;ts is of the mo&s;t lucrative nature, and of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable extent; the number of &s;hips employed by it are a great re&s;ource to our maritime power; the mo|nopoly at home is corrected, and the foreign trade is reco|vered. And what is of equal weight, all that we gain on this &s;y&s;tem, is made fourfold to us, by the lo&s;s which en&s;ues to France. But our conque&s;ts in North America, however ad|vantageous they may prove to us, in the idea of &s;ecurity, (for in that re&s;pect alone they are of any moment) are of very little detriment to the commerce of France. On the We&s;t India &s;cheme of acqui&s;ition, our gain and her lo&s;s go hand in hand.</P>
<P>They in&s;i&s;ted upon the obvious connection of this trade, with that of our colonies in North America, and with our commerce to the coa&s;t of Africa. The African trade, &s;aid they, will be augmented, by the demand for &s;laves. That of North America will all center in our&s;elves. Whereas if the i&s;lands are all re&s;tored, a great part of the benefit of the northern colony trade mu&s;t redound, as it has hitherto done, to tho&s;e who were lately our enemies, and will al|ways be our rivals.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erved, that there was nothing extravagant or overbearing in this demand. That though we &s;hould re|tain either Martinico or Guadeloupe, or even both the&s;e
<PB N="553" REF="627">
i&s;lands, our conque&s;ts were &s;uch, that there was &s;till abun|dant matter left to di&s;play our moderation in the ce&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t. To &s;ay nothing of our many conce&s;&s;ions in the fi&s;hery; on the coa&s;t of Africa; and in the Ea&s;t Indies; from all which great provinces of commerce the French had been entirely driven this war, and to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of which they were re&s;tored by the treaty. But if further conce&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be made (for which however they &s;aw no nece&s;&s;ity) let the prodigious demand in North Ame|rica be &s;omewhat contracted; by this method we loo&s;e no|thing to our commerce; and we do not hazard our &s;ecuri|ty, as we &s;hall &s;till be infinitely &s;uperior in &s;trength; and whenever a war breaks out, that power will be mo&s;t &s;ecure, who&s;e re&s;ources are mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Such are conci&s;ely, and, we flatter our&s;elves, fairly, the principal heads of argument, brought by the be&s;t writers upon this &s;ide of the que&s;tion; they were replied to by the be&s;t writers on the other, upon the following principles.</P>
<P>That the original object of the war was the &s;ecurity of our colonies upon the continent; that the danger to which the&s;e colonies were expo&s;ed, and in con&s;equence of that danger, the immen&s;e wa&s;te of blood and trea&s;ure which en|&s;ued to Great Britain, together with the calamities, which were from the &s;ame &s;ource, derived upon the four quart|ers of the world, left no &s;ort of doubt that it was not only our be&s;t, but our only policy, to guard again&s;t all po&s;&s;ibili|ty of the return of &s;uch evils. Experience has &s;hewn us that while France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any &s;ingle place in America, from whence &s;he may mole&s;t our &s;ettlements, they can ne|ver enjoy any repo&s;e, and of cour&s;e that we are never &s;e|cure from being plunged again into tho&s;e calamities, from which we have at length, and with &s;o much difficulty, hap|pily emerged. To remove France from our neighbourhood in America, or to contract her power within the narrowe&s;t limits po&s;&s;ible, is therefore the mo&s;t capital advantage we can obtain; and is worth purcha&s;ing by almo&s;t any conce&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>They in&s;i&s;ted that the ab&s;olute &s;ecurity derived from this plan, included in it&s;elf an indemnification. Fir&s;t; by &s;av|ing us, more effectually than any other method could, from the nece&s;&s;ity of another war, and con&s;equently by giving us an opportunity of increa&s;ing our trade, and low|ering our debt. Secondly; by permitting our colonies on

he continent to extend them&s;elves without danger or mo|le&s;tation. They &s;hewed the great increa&s;e of poppulation in tho&s;e colonies within a few years. They &s;hewed that their trade with the mother country had uniformly in|crea&s;ed with this population. That being now freed from the mole&s;tation of enemies, and the emulations of rivals, unlimited in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;afe in their per&s;ons, our American planters would by the very cour&s;e of their natural propogation in a very &s;hort time, furni&s;h out a demand of our manufactures, as large as all the working hands of Great Britain could po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply. That there was therefore no rea&s;on to dread that want of trade, which their adver&s;aries in&s;inuated, &s;ince North America alone would &s;upply the deficiences of our trade in every other part of the world.</P>
<P>They expatiated on the great variety of climates, which that country contained, and the va&s;t re&s;ources which would thence ari&s;e to commerce. That the value of our conque&s;ts thereby ought not to be e&s;timated by the pre&s;ent produce, but by their probable increa&s;e, Neither ought the value of any country to be &s;olely tried on its commercial advan|tages; that extent of territory and a number of &s;ubjects, are matters of as much con&s;ideration to a &s;tate attentive to the &s;ources of real grandeur, as the mere advantages of traffic; that &s;uch ideas are rather &s;uitable to a limited and petty commonwealth, like Holland, than to a great, powerful and warlike nation. That on the&s;e principles, having made very large demands in North America, it was nece&s;&s;ary to relax in other parts. That France would never be brought to any con&s;iderable ce&s;&s;ion in the We&s;t Indies; but that her power and increa&s;e there could never become formida|ble, becau&s;e the exi&s;tence of her &s;ettlements depended up|on ours in North America, &s;he not being any longer left a place from whence they can be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions; that in lo&s;ing &s;omething of the &s;ugar trade, we lo&s;t very lit|tle el&s;e than a luxury: as to the other produce of the We&s;t Indies, it might be in a great mea&s;ure, and in part already was &s;upplied by our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent, which dai|ly increa&s;ed not only in the quantity but in the kind of its produce.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to pa&s;s any judgment on the merits of the &s;everal &s;ides of this que&s;tion, which is certainly a ve|ry difficult one. We relate opinions, as well as facts, hi&s;|torically.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="631">The only point, which remained to be adju&s;ted in the We&s;t Indies, was the logwood trade. Spain con&s;ented not to di&s;turb the Engli&s;h in their occupation of cutting log|wood in the bay of Honduras, and to permit them to occu|py &s;uch buildings as may be nece&s;&s;ary for them in this occu|pation.

It is, however, difficult to point out a better method of adju&s;ting a claim of &s;uch a pe|culiar nature. The right we claimed was not a right to the territory, nor directly to the produce; but only a privilege of cutting and taking away this wood by indulgence. To have in&s;i&s;ted on the right of erecting fortifications, would have been making the &s;tronge&s;t claim to an ab&s;olute, direct and exclu&s;ive dominion over the territory it&s;elf; a point, to which I do not find that our mo&s;t exten&s;ive claims have ever been carried.</P>

: Although this mu&s;t be regarded as a very great conce&s;&s;ion, it does not however afford all tho&s;e advantages to France, which might be imagined at the fir&s;t view. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the fortifications erected at &s;uch a va&s;t expence in all tho&s;e &s;ettlements have been totally de&s;troyed; and it cannot be expected, in the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation of the French company, that they can, in the cour&s;e of many years, if at all, be re&s;tored to their former &s;tate; in Bengal, (including, by an explanation an|nexed to the definitive treaty, the kingdom of Orixa.) they have engaged to erect no kind of fortification, nor to keep any number of &s;oldiers what&s;oever.

Thirdly, during the cour&s;e of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the traders and the manufacturers have removed from the French to our &s;ettlements, where they will have at lea&s;t an equal market, and a &s;uperior protection; and it will be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to bring them back.</P>

<P>This is the general outline of the late treaty. The par|ticulars given here will &s;erve to point out the &s;pirit and the general effect of that tran&s;action, which has been the &s;ub|ject of &s;o much heat and controver&s;y; and which nothing but adulation will a&s;&s;ert to be free from defect, nor any thing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">action can deny to be productive of many very great and e&s;&s;ential advantages to this kingdom.</P>
<P>This treaty, while it remained in agitation, formed a great cri&s;is, not only in the affairs of the nation, but in the fortune of the new mini&s;try. Towards the latter end of the &s;ummer Mr. Fox was called in, and engaged in their &s;upport. Though he continued in his old place of payma&s;|ter, he undertook to conduct the affairs, of government in the hou&s;e of commons. Mr. Grenville, who&s;e employ|ment would naturally have engaged him in that ta&s;k, re|&s;igned the &s;eals of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and was appointed fir&s;t lord of the admiralty. The great experience and known parliamentary abilities of Mr. Fox, &s;eemed to give new life to the affairs of the admini&s;tration. A more vigorous and determined conduct was from that time adopted. Ma|ny of tho&s;e, who were not perfectly attached to the new &s;y&s;tem, were immediately removed from their employ|ments; and mea&s;ures were taken to clear every department of every friend of the Duke of Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the&s;e proceedings &s;eemed to augment that
<PB N="557" REF="633">
of the oppo&s;ition. It was apprehended, that the prelimina|ries would undergo a rigorous &s;crutiny, and might po&s;&s;ibly incur a heavy cen&s;ure from parliament. The terms of peace were critici&s;ed without mercy. They were declared to be inglorious, inadequate, and in&s;ecure; unequal to the great &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the war, and below the ju&s;t expectations of the nation; that our commerce was neglected, and our allies abandoned. Public expectation was however entirely di&s;|appointed. The preliminaries were approved, without any qualification, by both hou&s;es; by the lords with out any divi&s;ion;

 <MILESTONE N="Dec. 9."> 

 by the commons with a very di&s;|proportioned majority.</P>
<P>Many cau&s;es concurred to produce this moderate di&s;po&s;i|tion. Fir&s;t, a very great number, which included almo&s;t all the Tories, were engaged in the &s;upport of the admini&s;|tration. The then chiefs of the oppo&s;ition were not well agreed among them&s;elves. Mr. Pitt who was con&s;idered as a party in him&s;elf, had not joined with the duke of Newca&s;|tle, nor &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to act with any particular body. The &s;ame general plan of peace, which many now in the oppo&s;ition had formerly approved, had been adopted in the&s;e preliminaries, and evidently improved. It is true, it had been objected, that our additional &s;ucce&s;&s;es, &s;ince that time, gave us ground to expect better terms; but it was an&s;wer|ed, that our national burthens, and the extent of the war, had increa&s;ed in, at lea&s;t, an equal proportion; and that peace was become nece&s;&s;ary to the nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments whatever weight they might have in them&s;elves, were &s;trong again&s;t the&s;e, upon whom they were rather retorted, than for the fir&s;t time levelled, being altogether agreable to the &s;y&s;tem which many now in op|po&s;ition had always pur&s;ued, and to the &s;entiments many of them had publickly avowed, and perhaps &s;till &s;ecretly re|tained. On the whole, it was evident, that, when the que&s;tion came on, the di&s;contented party was found not ve|ry well united, and ab&s;olutely unprovided of any regular &s;cheme of oppo&s;ition. However, though baffled on this occa&s;ion, it has &s;ince begun to revive and to unite; and though peace is happily re&s;tored with foreign powers, our dome&s;tic quiet is &s;till far from being &s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>With regard to the powers in Germany, the peace be|tween England and France, and the &s;uperiority of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia at the clo&s;e of the campaign, in&s;pired, at length,
<PB N="558" REF="634">
though unwillingly, a di&s;po&s;ition to peace. Conferences were opened at Hubert&s;berg, and a treaty concluded be|tween his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty and the empre&s;s queen. As af|fairs in this treaty were &s;peedily adju&s;ted, &s;o they may be very conci&s;ely related. The &s;ub&s;tance of it was no more than that a mutual re&s;titution and oblivion &s;hould take place, and each party &s;it down at the end of the war in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which they began it. Thus the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, after having for &s;ix years contended again&s;t the ef|forts of almo&s;t all the great powers of Europe, by who&s;e enmity he could be affected, having &s;tood proof again&s;t the mo&s;t terrible blows of fortune, enjoys at length the full re|ward of his uncommon magnanimity. He retains his do|minions in their utmo&s;t extent; and having delivered his country by his incomparable talents for war, he now en|joys lei&s;ure to recover it by his no le&s;s admirable talents for government. Scarcely was the war concluded, when he began to di&s;play his attention to dome&s;tic policy, and his care for the happine&s;s of his people. He imediately di&s;|tributed lands to his di&s;banded &s;oldiery; and gave them the hor&s;es of his artillery to aid them in their cultivation.</P>
<P>Europe is new pacified; and &s;he begins to re&s;pire, after a more general and a more bloody war than any the world had experienced &s;ince that which was concluded by the peace of We&s;tphalia. As far as it is &s;afe to judge concern|ing a &s;y&s;tem which is &s;ubject to &s;o great and unfore&s;een va|riations, and &s;ometimes from very &s;light cau&s;es, this peace promi&s;es a con&s;iderable duration. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia will hardly again commit his affairs, &s;o miraculou&s;ly retrieved to the chances of war. He &s;ees how dearly he has a &s;econd time purcha&s;ed his conque&s;t of Sile&s;ia, and he will hardly aim at new acqui&s;itions. The empre&s;s, &s;ince &s;he failed to reduce Sile&s;ia, or even to recover the &s;malle&s;t particle of her lo&s;&s;es, with &s;uch an exertion of her own &s;trength, and with &s;uch an alliance as never was &s;een united before, and with which &s;he can never flatter her&s;elf again, mu&s;t be con|vinced how vain it is to attempt any change in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem in Germany.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia remained circum&s;tanced as &s;he &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent, there is a very good pro&s;pect for the tranquillity of the North.</P>
<P>France has turned her thoughts to a much wanted oeco|nomy and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of her marine, &s;he has
<PB N="559" REF="635">
reduced her land forces, by above one half. England, with out le&s;&s;ening the ordinary e&s;tabli&s;hment of her navy, has augmented her military, in con&s;equence of the extent of her conque&s;ts. Both nations &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of being prepared, and yet quiet. The Bourbon courts are united but weakened. The mutual jealou&s;y of the nations, which have been lately at war, continues; but their &s;ubjects of di&s;pute, and occa&s;ions of animo&s;ity, are much le&s;&s;ened. This is as good a &s;ituation as could rea|&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P>We have thus accompli&s;hed our de&s;ign of laying before the public a connected narrative of the events of the late mo&s;t remarkable war, which we have pur&s;ued from its commencement to its conclu&s;ion. We have omitted no care to make it as perfect as the nature of &s;uch an under|taking would permit; and we flatter our&s;elves, that it will be thought as impartial, and &s;atisfactory, as any work of the kind extant.</P>
