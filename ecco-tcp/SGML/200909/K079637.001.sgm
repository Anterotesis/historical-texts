<HEAD>TO William Mitford, E&s;q. LIEUT. COL. OF THE SOUTHERN BATTALION OF HAMPSHIRE-MILITIA; AND ONE OF THE VERDERORS OF NEW-FOREST.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Vicar's-hill, <DATE>March 4, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN your friend&s;hip fixed me in this plea&s;ing retreat, within the precincts of New-fore&s;t, I had little intention of wandering farther among it's &s;cenes, than the bounds of my own pari&s;h; or of amu&s;ing my&s;elf
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
any more with writing on pic|ture&s;que &s;ubjects. But one &s;cene drew me on to another; till at length I had traver&s;ed the whole fore&s;t. The &s;ubject was new to me. I had been much among lakes, and mountains: but I had never lived in a fore&s;t. I knew little of it's &s;cenery. Every thing caught my attention; and as I generally had a memorandum-book in my hand, I made minutes of what I ob&s;erved; throwing my remarks under the two heads of <HI>fore&s;t-&s;cenery in general;</HI> and <HI>the &s;cenery of particular places.</HI> Thus, as &s;mall things lead to greater, an evening walk, or ride, became the foundation of a volume.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">In methodizing my remarks I divided them into three books. In the fir&s;t, I have con&s;idered trees, (which are the foundation of all &s;cenery,) as <HI>&s;ingle objects.</HI> I have endeavoured to inve&s;tigate their general picture&s;que quali|ties&mdash;in their &s;everal kinds&mdash;and in the &s;pecific character of each; concluding the book with a &s;hort account of &s;ome of the mo&s;t cele|brated trees, which have been noticed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd book con&s;iders trees under their various modes of <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> from the clump to the fore&s;t. It con&s;iders them likewi&s;e under the &s;everal picture&s;que cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
of <HI>permanent,</HI> and <HI>acci|dental</HI> beauty, in which we often find them. As the fir&s;t book con|cluded with an account of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed trees, the &s;econd concludes with a &s;hort view of fore&s;t-hi&s;tory; and of the &s;everal fore&s;ts, that may be traced in Great Britain.</P>
<P>This leads me directly to New-fore&s;t, which is the &s;ubject of the third book. It opens with a few ob&s;ervations on this cele|brated tract of country. The &s;cenery of it is next de&s;cribed in a &s;eries of journeys through it's &s;everal divi&s;ions; and la&s;tly, the modes and habits of life are re|marked,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
of &s;uch animals, as in|habit, and embelli&s;h it.</P>
<P>It is now, my dear Sir, above ten years, &s;ince you fir&s;t &s;aw this work in MS.; during which time it has received frequent revi&s;al; and much addition, as new occur|rences, and ob&s;ervations aro&s;e. To many of my friends likewi&s;e I owe obligations, who have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with their critici&s;ms; and to you in particular, who are &s;o well acquainted with the&s;e &s;cenes, and have furni&s;hed me with many ju|dicious remarks, and entertaining fore&s;t-anecdotes.&mdash;I am de&s;irous, you &s;ee, to engage you with me in this work. You are as fond of
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
the&s;e amu&s;ements as I am; and when we trifle, we like to have the &s;anction of tho&s;e we e&s;teem, to trifle with us.&mdash;I hope how|ever, that while you, &s;hewing the world how Herodotus and Thucy|dides would have written in Eng|li&s;h, are throwing the colours of truth on the crimes of antiquity: and while I am humbly endeavour|ing to point out, as my profe&s;&s;ion leads, that greater advantages &s;hould be attended with more virtuous conduct&mdash;the world will not be &s;o cynical as to find fault with our amu&s;ements; which tho certainly innocent, and rational, I believe neither of us con&s;iders as the prin|cipal employment of our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">How far the following work may be an amu&s;ement to others, I know not: You will, I am &s;ure, accept it with indulgence; and as a mark of that e&s;teem, affection, and friend&s;hip, with which I am, my dear Sir,</P>

<P>IT is no exaggerated prai&s;e to call a tree the <HI>grande&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>beautiful</HI> of all the pro|ductions of the earth. In the former of the&s;e epithets nothing contends with it; for we con&s;ider rocks and mountains, as part of the earth it&s;elf. And tho among inferior plants, &s;hrubs, and flowers, there is great beauty; yet when we con&s;ider, that the&s;e minuter pro|ductions are chiefly beautiful as <HI>individuals;</HI> and are not adapted to form the arrangement of <HI>compo&s;ition in land&s;cape;</HI> nor to receive the <HI>effects of light and &s;hade;</HI> they mu&s;t give place in point of <HI>beauty</HI>&mdash;of <HI>picture&s;que beauty</HI> at lea&s;t, which we are here con&s;idering&mdash;to the form and foliage, and ramification of the tree.
<PB N="2" REF="15">
Thus the &s;plendid tints of the in&s;ect, how|ever beautiful, mu&s;t yield to the elegance, and proportion of animals, which range in a higher cla&s;s.</P>
<P>With animal life, I &s;hould not &s;et the tree in competition. The &s;hape, the different-coloured fur, the varied, and &s;pirited attitudes, the character, and motion, which &s;trike us in the animal creation, are certainly beyond &s;till-life in its mo&s;t plea&s;ing appearance. I &s;hould only ob&s;erve with regard to trees, that nature has been kinder to them in point of <HI>variety,</HI> than even to its <HI>living forms.</HI> Tho every animal is di&s;tingui&s;hed from its fellow, by &s;ome little variation of colour, character, or &s;hape; yet in all the <HI>larger parts,</HI> in the body and limbs, the re&s;emblance is generally exact. In trees, it is ju&s;t the rever&s;e: the <HI>&s;maller parts,</HI> the &s;pray, the leaves, the blo&s;|&s;om, and the &s;eed, are the &s;ame in all trees of the &s;ame kind: while the larger parts, from which the <HI>mo&s;t beautiful varieties</HI> re&s;ult, are wholly different. You never &s;ee two oaks with an equal number of limbs, the &s;ame kind of head, and twi&s;ted in the &s;ame form.&mdash; However, as <HI>variety</HI> is not alone &s;ufficient to give &s;uperiority to the tree; we give the pre|ference on the whole, to animal life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>TREES when young, like &s;triplings, &s;hoot into taper forms. There is a lightne&s;s, and an airine&s;s in them, which is plea&s;ing; but they do not &s;pread and receive their ju&s;t proportions, till they have attained their full growth.</P>
<P>There is as much difference too in trees, I mean in trees of the &s;ame kind, in point of beauty, as there is in human figures. The limbs of &s;ome are &s;et on awkwardly; their trunks are di&s;proportioned; and their whole form is unplea&s;ing. The &s;ame rules, which e&s;tabli&s;h elegance in other objects, e&s;tabli&s;h it in the&s;e. There mu&s;t be the &s;ame harmony of parts; the &s;ame &s;weeping line; the &s;ame contra&s;t, the &s;ame ea&s;e and freedom. A bough indeed may i&s;&s;ue from the trunk at right-angles, and yet elegantly, as it frequently does in the oak; but it mu&s;t immediately form &s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="17">
contra&s;ting &s;weep, or the junction will be awkward.</P>
<P>All forms, that are <HI>unnatural,</HI> di&s;plea&s;e. A tree lopped into a may-pole, as you generally &s;ee in the hedge-rows of Surry, and &s;ome other countries, is di&s;gu&s;ting. Clipped yews, lime hedges, and pollards are, for the &s;ame rea&s;on di&s;agreeable: and yet I have &s;ometimes &s;een a pollard produce a good effect, when nature has been &s;uffered, for &s;ome years, to bring it again into form: but I never &s;aw a good effect pro|duced by a pollard, on which &s;ome &s;ingle &s;tem was left to grow into a tree. The &s;tem is of a different growth: it is di&s;proportioned; and always unites awkwardly with the trunk.</P>
<P>Not only all forms, that are unnatural, di&s;plea&s;e; but even natural forms, when they bear a re&s;emblance to art, unle&s;s indeed the&s;e forms are characteri&s;tic of the &s;pecies. A cypre&s;s plea&s;es in a conic form; but an oak, or an elm trimmed into that appearance, would di&s;gu&s;t. In the cypre&s;s nature adapts the &s;pray, and branches to the form of the tree. In the oak and elm the &s;pray, and branches form a different character.</P>
<P><PB REF="18"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19"><HI>Lightne&s;s</HI> al&s;o is a characteri&s;tic of beauty in a tree: for tho there are beautiful trees of a heavy, as well as of a light form; yet their extremities mu&s;t in &s;ome parts be &s;eparated, and hang with a degree of loo&s;ene&s;s from the fulne&s;s of the foliage, which occupies the middle of the tree, or the whole will only be a large bu&s;h. From po&s;ition indeed, and contra&s;t, heavine&s;s, tho in it&s;elf a deformity, may be of &s;ingular u&s;e in the compo&s;ition both of natural, and of artificial land&s;cape.</P>
<P>A tree al&s;o mu&s;t be <HI>well-balanced</HI> to be beautiful. It may have form, and it may have lightne&s;s; and yet lo&s;e all its effect, by wanting a proper poi&s;e. The bole mu&s;t appear to &s;upport the branches. We do not de&s;ire to &s;ee it &s;upporting it's burden with the per|pendicular firmne&s;s of a column. An ea&s;y &s;weep is always agreeable: but at the &s;ame time it &s;hould not be &s;uch a &s;weep, as di&s;|covers one &s;ide plainly overbalanced.</P>
<P>On bleak &s;ea-coa&s;ts, trees generally take an unbalanced form: and indeed in general, &s;ome
<PB N="6" REF="20">
foreign cau&s;e mu&s;t operate to occa&s;ion it; for nature working freely, is as much inclined to balance a tree upon it's trunk, as an animal upon it's legs.</P>
<P>And yet in &s;ome circum&s;tances, I have &s;een beauty ari&s;e even from an unbalanced tree; but it mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome peculiar &s;ituation, which gives it a local propriety. A tree, for in&s;tance, hanging from a rock, tho totally unpoi&s;ed, may be beautiful: or it may have a good effect, when we &s;ee it bending over a road; becau&s;e it corre&s;ponds with it's peculiar &s;ituation. We do not, in the&s;e ca&s;es, admire it as a tree; but as the adjunct of an effect; the beauty of which does not give the eye lei&s;ure to attend to the deformity of the in&s;tru|ment, through which the effect is produced.</P>
<P>Without the&s;e requi&s;ites therefore, <HI>form, lightne&s;s,</HI> and a <HI>proper balance,</HI> no tree can have that <HI>&s;pecies of beauty,</HI> which we call <HI>picture&s;que.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e requi&s;ites of beauty in a tree, there are other things of an <HI>adven|titious kind,</HI> which often add great beauty to it. And here I cannot help lamenting the capricious nature of <HI>picture&s;que ideas.</HI> In many in&s;tances they run counter to <HI>utility;</HI> and in nothing more than in the adventitious beauties a&s;cribed to trees. Many of the&s;e are derived from the injuries the tree receives, or the di&s;ea&s;es, to which it is &s;ubject. Mr. Law&s;on, a naturali&s;t of the la&s;t age, thus enu|merates them. "How many fore&s;ts, and woods, &s;ays he, have we, wherein you &s;hall have, for one lively, thriving tree, four, nay &s;ometimes twenty-four, evil thriving, rotten, and dying trees: what rottenne&s;s! what hol|lowne&s;s! what dead arms! withered tops! curtailed trunks! what loads of mo&s;&s;es! droop|ing
<PB N="8" REF="23">
boughs, and dying branches, &s;hall you &s;ee every where."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Law&s;on's Orchard.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now all the&s;e maladies, which our di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed naturali&s;t bemoans with &s;o much feeling, are often capital &s;ources of picture&s;que beauty, both in the wild &s;cenes of nature, and in arti|ficial land&s;cape.</P>
<P>What is more beautiful, for in&s;tance, on a rugged foreground, than an old tree with a <HI>hollow trunk?</HI> or with a <HI>dead arm,</HI> a <HI>drooping bough,</HI> or a <HI>dying branch?</HI> all which phra&s;es, I apprehend are nearly &s;ynonymous.</P>
<P>From the <HI>withered top</HI> al&s;o great u&s;e, and beauty may re&s;ult in the compo&s;ition of land|&s;cape; when we wi&s;h to break the regularity of &s;ome continued line; which we would not intirely hide.</P>
<P>By the <HI>curtailed trunk</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Law&s;on means a tree, who&s;e principal &s;tem has been &s;hattered by winds, or &s;ome other accident; while the lower part of it is left in vigour. This is al&s;o a beautiful circum&s;tance; and it's application equally u&s;eful in land&s;cape. The <HI>withered top</HI> ju&s;t breaks the lines of an
<PB REF="24">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="9" REF="26">
eminence: the <HI>curtailed trunk</HI> di&s;covers the whole: while the lateral branches, which are vigorous, and healthy in both, hide any part of the lower land&s;cape, which wanting variety, is better veiled.</P>
<P>For the u&s;e, and beauty of the <HI>withered top,</HI> and <HI>curtailed trunk,</HI> we need only appeal to the works of Salvator Ro&s;a, in many of which we find them of great u&s;e. Salvator had often occa&s;ion for an object on his fore|grounds, as large as the trunk of a tree; when the whole tree together in it's full &s;tate of grandeur, would have been an incumbrance to him. A young tree, or a bu&s;h, might probably have &s;erved his purpo&s;e with regard to <HI>compo&s;ition;</HI> but &s;uch dwarfs, and &s;triplings could not have pre&s;erved the dignity of his &s;ubject, like the ruins of a noble tree. The&s;e &s;plendid remnants of decaying grandeur &s;peak to the imagination in a &s;tile of eloquence, which the &s;tripling cannot reach: they record the hi&s;tory of &s;ome &s;torm, &s;ome bla&s;t of lightening, or other great event, which tran&s;|fers it's grand ideas to the land&s;cape; and in the repre&s;entation of elevated &s;ubjects a&s;&s;i&s;ts the &s;ublime.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="27">Whether the&s;e maladies in trees ever produce beauty in <HI>adorned nature,</HI> I much doubt. Kent was hardy enough even <HI>to plant a withered tree;</HI> but the error was too glaring for imitation. Objects in every mode of compo&s;ition &s;hould harmonize; and all we venture to a&s;&s;ert, is, that the&s;e maladies are then only &s;ources of beauty either in the wild &s;cenes of nature, or in artificial land&s;cape, when they are the ap|pendages of <HI>&s;ome particular mode of compo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which Mr. Law&s;on a&s;cribes to trees, is <HI>mo&s;s.</HI> This, it is true, is one of nature's minutiae, and in painting, touches not the great parts, <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> and <HI>effect.</HI> Nor is it of u&s;e in mere drawing. But in coloured land&s;cape, it is &s;urely a very beautiful object of imitation.&mdash;The variety of mo&s;&s;es&mdash;the green, which tinges the trunk of the beech; the brim&s;tone co|loured, and black, which &s;tain the oak; and the yellow, which is frequently found on the elm, and a&s;h, are among the mo&s;t beautiful of tho&s;e tints, which embelli&s;h the bark of trees.</P>
<P>I have often &s;tood with admiration before an old fore&s;t-oak, examining the various tints, which have enriched it's furrowed &s;tem. The
<PB N="11" REF="28">
genuine bark of an oak is of an a&s;h-colour, tho it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h any part of it from the mo&s;&s;es, that over&s;pread it: for no oak, I &s;uppo&s;e, was ever without a greater, or a le&s;s proportion of the&s;e picture&s;que ap|pendages. The lower parts, about the roots, are often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that green, velvet mo&s;s, which in a &s;till greater degree commonly oc|cupies the bole of the beech; tho the beauty and brilliancy of it lo&s;e much, when in decay. As the trunk ri&s;es, you &s;ee the brim&s;tone colour taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in patches. Of this there are two principal kinds; a &s;mooth &s;ort, which &s;preads like a &s;curf over the bark; and a rougher &s;ort, which hangs in little rich knots, and fringes. I call it a brim&s;tone hue, by way of general di&s;tinction: but it &s;ome|times inclines to an olive; and &s;ometimes to a light green. Intermixed with the&s;e mo&s;&s;es you often find a &s;pecies perfectly white. Be|fore I was acquainted with it, I have &s;ome|times thought the tree white-wa&s;hed. Here and there, a touch of it gives a lu&s;tre to the trunk, and has it's effect: yet, on the whole, it is a nui&s;ance; for as it generally begins to thrive, when the other mo&s;&s;es begin to wither (as if the <HI>decaying</HI> bark were it's
<PB N="12" REF="29">
proper nutriment,) it is rarely accompanied with any of the more beautiful &s;pecies of it's kind; and when thus un&s;upported, it always di&s;gu&s;ts. This white mo&s;s, by the way, is e&s;teemed a certain mark of age; and when it prevails in any degree, is a clear indication, that the vigour of the tree is declining. We find al&s;o another &s;pecies of mo&s;s, of a dark brown colour, inclining nearly to black: another of an a&s;hy colour; and another of a dingy yellow. We may ob&s;erve al&s;o touches of red; and &s;ometimes, but rarely a bright yellow, which is like a gleam of &s;un-&s;hine; and in many trees you will &s;ee one &s;pecies growing upon another; the knotted brim&s;tone-coloured fringe clinging to a lighter &s;pecies; or the black &s;oftening into red.&mdash;Strictly &s;peaking, many of the&s;e excre&s;cences, which I have mentioned under the general name of <HI>mo&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;hould have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by other names. All tho&s;e particularly, which cling clo&s;e to the bark of trees, and have a leprous, &s;cabby appearance, are cla&s;&s;ed, I believe, by botani&s;ts, under the name of <HI>lychens:</HI> others are called <HI>liver-worts.</HI> But all the&s;e excre|&s;cences, under whatever names di&s;tingui&s;hed, add a great richne&s;s to trees; and when they
<PB N="13" REF="30">
are blended harmoniou&s;ly, as is generally the ca&s;e, the rough and furrowed trunk of an old oak, adorned with the&s;e plea&s;ing appen|dages, is an object, which will long detain the picture&s;que eye.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the appearance of mo&s;s upon the trunks of trees, it creeps among the branches, and &s;ometimes takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion not only of the larger boughs; but even of the &s;maller &s;pray. In winter this has often a fine effect, when the whole tree, turned into a beautiful piece of &s;traw-coloured coral, appears again&s;t a dark wood, or &s;ome other back|ground, which gives it relief. In a &s;trong &s;un&s;hine too it is beautiful; when the light &s;traw-coloured tints contra&s;t with the &s;hadows formed by the twi&s;ting of the boughs; which are &s;ometimes &s;till further deepened by &s;ome of the darker mo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus the maladies of trees are greatly &s;ub|&s;ervient to the u&s;es of the pencil. The foliage is the dre&s;s; and the&s;e are the ornaments.&mdash; Even the poet will &s;ometimes deign to array his tree with the&s;e picture&s;que ornaments. I am always glad of his authority, when I can have it: and I have &s;een a poetical oak gar|ni&s;hed in a way, that the painter might copy
<PB N="14" REF="31">
from. In general, however the poet is not, like the painter, <HI>uniform</HI> in his admiration of the&s;e plea&s;ing appendages. If at one time he admires them with the painter, and ranks them among the picture&s;que beauties of na|ture; at another he &s;ides with the wood-man, and bru&s;hes them away. Nay, I have known him conjure up &s;ome mighty agent, as guar|dian of his woods; who cries out,
<Q><L>&mdash;From Jove I am the Power</L>
<L>Of this fair wood, and live in oaken bower.</L>
<L>I nur&s;e my &s;aplins tall; and clean&s;e their rind</L>
<L>From vegetating filth of every kind.</L>
<L>And all my plants I &s;ave from nightly ill</L>
<L>Of noi&s;ome winds, and bla&s;ting vapours chill.</L></Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides Mr. Law&s;on's catalogue of maladies we might enumerate others, which are equally the &s;ources of beauty. The <HI>bla&s;ted tree</HI> has often a fine effect both in natural, and in arti|ficial land&s;cape. In &s;ome &s;cenes it is almo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. When the dreary heath is &s;pread before the eye, and ideas of wildne&s;s and de&s;olation are required, what more &s;uitable accompaniment can be imagined, than the bla&s;ted oak, ragged, &s;cathed, and leafle&s;s; &s;hooting it's peeled, white branches athwart the gathering blackne&s;s of &s;ome ri&s;ing &s;torm?</P>
<P><PB REF="32"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="33"><HI>Ivy</HI> is another mi&s;chief incident to trees, which has a good effect. It gives great rich|ne&s;s to an old trunk, both by it's &s;tem, which often winds round it in thick, hairy, irregular volumes; and by it's leaf, which either decks the furrowed bark; or creeps among the branches; or hangs carele&s;sly from them. In all the&s;e circum&s;tances it unites with the mo&s;&s;es, and other furniture of the tree, in adorning, and enriching it. But when it gathers into a heavy body, which is often the ca&s;e, it becomes rather a deformity. In &s;ummer indeed it's bu&s;hine&s;s is lo&s;t in the foliage of the tree; but in winter, <HI>naked branches</HI> make a di&s;agreeable appearance &s;taring from a <HI>thick bu&s;h.</HI>&mdash;And yet in autumn I have &s;een a beautiful contra&s;t between a bu&s;h of ivy, which had completely inve&s;ted the head of a pollard-oak, and the dark brown tint of the withered leaves, which &s;till held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the branches. But this was a mere accidental effect; for you may &s;ee many pollard-oaks with withered leaves, and covered with ivy; and yet not &s;ee the tints &s;o happily arranged as to produce an effect.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring al&s;o we &s;ometimes have a plea&s;ing appearance of a &s;imilar kind. About the end of April, when the foliage of the oak
<PB N="16" REF="34">
is ju&s;t beginning to expand, it's varied tints are often delightfully contra&s;ted with the deep green of an ivy bu&s;h, which has over&s;pread the body, and larger limbs of the tree: and the contra&s;t has been &s;till more beautiful, when the limbs are covered, as we &s;ometimes &s;ee them, with tufts of brim&s;tone-coloured mo&s;s.</P>
<P>All the&s;e plants are <HI>para&s;itical,</HI> as the botani&s;t expre&s;&s;ively calls them. The tribes of mo&s;&s;es, lychens, and liver-worts make no pretence to independence. They are ab&s;olute retainers. Not one of them gets his own livelihood; nor takes the lea&s;t &s;tep towards it. The ivy in|deed is le&s;s dependent. He has a root of his own, and draws nouri&s;hment from the ground: but his character is mi&s;repre&s;ented, if his little feelers have not other purpo&s;es, than merely that of &s;hewing an attachment to his potent neighbour. Shake&s;pear roundly a&s;&s;erts, he makes a property of him:
<Q><L>&mdash; He was</L>
<L>The ivy, which had hid my princely trunk,</L>
<L>And &s;uck'd my verdure out&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this para&s;itical tribe the painter ad|mires another cla&s;s of humble plants, which
<PB N="17" REF="35">
live entirely on their own means; yet &s;preading out their little tendrils, beg merely the pro|tection of the great; whom if they encumber, as they certainly do in a degree, they enrich with a variety of beautiful flowers, and &s;carlet berries. Many of the&s;e, tho cla&s;&s;ed among weeds, have great beauty. Among them, the black, and white brionies are di&s;tingui&s;hed. The berries al&s;o of many of the&s;e little plants are variou&s;ly coloured in the different &s;tates of their growth, yellow, red, and orange. All the&s;e rich touches, however &s;mall, produce their effect. There is another elegant climber, called <HI>traveller's joy,</HI> which produces indeed no berries; but it's feathered &s;eeds are orna|mental. The wild honey-&s;uckle al&s;o comes within this cla&s;s; and tho in winding it's &s;piral coil, it may compre&s;s the young tree too tightly; and in &s;ome degree injure it's circulation; yet it fully compen&s;ates the injury by the beauty, and fragrancy of it's flowers:
<Q><L>With cla&s;ping tendrils it inve&s;ts the branch,</L>
<L>El&s;e unadorned, with many a gay fe&s;toon,</L>
<L>And fragrant chaplet; recompen&s;ing well</L>
<L>The &s;trength it borrows with the grace it lends.</L></Q></P>
<P>Under warm &s;uns, where vines are the offspring of nature, nothing can be more beau|tiful
<PB N="18" REF="36">
than the fore&s;t tree, adorned with their twi&s;ting branches, hanging from bough to bough, and laden with fruit;
<Q><L>&mdash;the clu&s;ters clear</L>
<L>Half through the foliage &s;een&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t beautiful appendages of this hanging kind, which we have in England, is the hop. In cultivation it is di&s;agreeable: but in it's rude natural &s;tate twi&s;ting carele&s;sly round the branches of trees, I know not whe|ther it is not as beautiful as the vine. It's leaf is &s;imilar; and tho the bunches of hop, beau|tiful as they are, and fragrant, are not equal to the clu&s;ters of the vine; yet it is a more accommodating plant, hangs more loo&s;ely, and is le&s;s extravagant in it's growth.</P>
<P>In artificial land&s;cape indeed, where the &s;ubject is &s;ublime, the&s;e appendages are of little value. Such trifling ornaments the &s;cene rejects. The rough oak, in the dignity of it's &s;imple form, adorns the foreground better. But in fe&s;tive, or Bacchanalian &s;ubjects (if &s;uch &s;ubjects are ever proper for de&s;cription) when the &s;portive nymphs, and &s;atyrs take their repo&s;e at noon, or gambol in the &s;hade of evening, nothing can more beautifully adorn
<PB N="19" REF="37">
their retreat, or more characteri&s;tically mark it, than the&s;e pendent plants, particularly the mantling vine, hanging, as I have here de|&s;cribed it, in rich fe&s;toons from bough to bough.</P>
<P>The rooting al&s;o of trees is a circum&s;tance, on which their beauty greatly depends. I know not, whether it is reckoned among the maladies of a tree, to heave his root above the &s;oil. Old trees generally do. But whether it be a malady or not, it is certainly very picture&s;que. The more they rai&s;e the ground around them, and the greater number of ra|dical knobs they heave up, the firmer they &s;eem to e&s;tabli&s;h their footing upon the earth; and the more dignity they a&s;&s;ume. An <HI>old tree</HI> ri&s;ing tamely from a <HI>&s;mooth &s;urface,</HI> (as we often find it covered with earth in arti|ficial ground,) lo&s;es half it's effect: it does not appear as the lord of the &s;oil; but to be &s;tuck into it; and would have a &s;till wor&s;e effect on canvas, than it has in nature.</P>
<P>Pliny gives us an account of the roots of certain ancient oaks in the Hercynian fore&s;t, which appears rather extravagant; but which
<PB N="20" REF="38">
I can ea&s;ily conceive may be true. The&s;e roots, he &s;ays, heave the ground upwards, in many places, into lofty mounts; and in other parts, where the earth does not follow them, the bare roots ri&s;e as high as the lower branches; and twi&s;ting round form in many places, portals &s;o wide, that a man and hor&s;e may ride upright through them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat. hi&s;t. Book xvi. chap. 2.</NOTE>.&mdash;This indeed is &s;omewhat higher than picture&s;que beauty requires; it borders rather on the fan|ta&s;tic. In <HI>general</HI> however, the higher the roots are, the more picture&s;que they appear.</P>
<P>To the adventitious beauties of trees, we may add their <HI>&s;u&s;ceptibility of motion,</HI> which is ca|pable at lea&s;t of being a con&s;iderable &s;ource of beauty. The waving heads of &s;ome, and the undulation of others, give a continual variety to their forms. In nature the motion of trees is certainly a circum&s;tance of great beauty.&mdash; Shake&s;pear formerly made the ob&s;ervation:
<Q><L>&mdash;Things in motion &s;ooner catch the eye,</L>
<L>Than what &s;tirs not&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="39">To the painter al&s;o the <HI>moving tree</HI> affords often a piece of u&s;eful machinery, when he wi&s;hes to expre&s;s the agitation of air. In this light it may even be con&s;idered as an objection to trees of firmer branches, as the oak, that their re&s;i&s;tance to every breath of air, deprives them at lea&s;t, of one &s;ource of beauty, and &s;ubjects them to be &s;ooner <HI>gotten by heart,</HI> if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, than other trees; which yielding to the pre&s;&s;ure, are every in&s;tant a&s;|&s;uming new modifications.</P>
<P>From the motion of the tree, we have al&s;o the plea&s;ing circum&s;tance of the <HI>chequered &s;hade,</HI> formed under it by the dancing of the &s;un-beams among it's playing leaves. This circum&s;tance, tho not &s;o much calculated for picture&s;que u&s;e, (as it's beauty ari&s;es chiefly from it's motion) is yet very amu&s;ing in nature; and may al&s;o be introduced in painting, when the tree is at re&s;t. But it is one of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which requires a very artful pen|cil. In it's very nature it oppo&s;es the grand principle of ma&s;&s;ing light, and &s;hade. How|ever if it be brought in properly, and not &s;uffered to glare, it may have it's beauty. But whatever becomes of this circum&s;tance in
<PB N="22" REF="40">
painting; it is very capable of being plea&s;ingly wrought up in poetry.</P>
<Q><L>The chequered earth &s;eems re&s;tle&s;s as a flood</L>

<P>HAVING thus examined trees in a <HI>general view,</HI> I &s;hall now particularize, and endeavour to explain the beauties and defects of their <HI>&s;everal kinds,</HI> as they regard <HI>land&s;cape.</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider them as <HI>individuals;</HI> and afterwards in <HI>compo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Trees range under two general heads, <HI>deci|duous,</HI> and <HI>ever-green.</HI> In this order I &s;hall take them; confining my remarks to tho&s;e only of both kinds which are of Engli&s;h growth, whether native, or naturalized.</P>
<P>Among deciduous trees, the <HI>oak</HI> pre&s;ents it&s;elf fir&s;t. It is a happine&s;s to the lovers of the picture&s;que, that this noble plant is as u&s;eful, as it is beautiful. From the utility of the oak, they derive this advantage, that it is every where found. In the choice indeed of it's &s;oil it is rather delicate. For tho it
<PB N="24" REF="42">
is rather undi&s;tingui&s;hing, during it's early growth, while it's horizontal fibres &s;traggle about the &s;urface of the earth; yet when it's tap-root begins to enter the depths of the &s;oil, perhaps no tree is nicer in it's di&s;crimi|nations. If it's con&s;titution be not &s;uited here, it may multiply it's progeny indeed, and pro|duce a thriving cop&s;e; but the puny race will never ri&s;e to lordly dignity in the fore&s;t, nor furni&s;h navies to command the ocean.</P>
<P>The particular, and mo&s;t valued qualities of the oak, are <HI>hardne&s;s</HI> and <HI>toughne&s;s.</HI> Shake|&s;pear u&s;es two epithets to expre&s;s the&s;e qualities, which are perhaps &s;tronger than any we can find.</P>
<Q><L>Thou rather with thy &s;harp, and &s;ulph'rous bolt</L>
<L>Split'&s;t the <HI>unwedgeable,</HI> and <HI>gnarled</HI> oak,</L>
<L>Than the &s;oft myrtle&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Many kinds of wood are <HI>harder,</HI> as box and ebony; many kinds are <HI>tougher,</HI> as yew and a&s;h: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed that no &s;pecies of wood, at lea&s;t no &s;pecies of timber, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of both the&s;e qualities together in &s;o great a degree, as Briti&s;h oak. Almo&s;t all arts and manufactures are indebted to it; but in &s;hip-building, and bearing burdens, it's ela&s;ticity,
<PB N="25" REF="43">
and &s;trength are applied to mo&s;t advantage. I mention the&s;e <HI>mechanic u&s;es</HI> only becau&s;e &s;ome of it's <HI>chief beauties</HI> are connected with them. Thus it is not the erect, &s;tately tree, that is always the mo&s;t u&s;eful in &s;hip-building; but more often the crooked one, forming &s;hort turns, and elbows, which the &s;hipwrights and carpenters commonly call <HI>knee-timber.</HI> This too is generally the mo&s;t picture&s;que.&mdash;Nor is it the &s;trait, tall &s;tem, who&s;e fibres run in pa|rallel lines, that is the mo&s;t u&s;eful in bearing burdens: but that who&s;e &s;inews are twi&s;ted, and &s;pirally combined. This too is the mo&s;t picture&s;que. Trees under the&s;e circum&s;tances, generally take the mo&s;t plea&s;ing forms.</P>
<P>Now the oak perhaps acquires the&s;e dif|ferent modes of growth from the different &s;trata, through which it pa&s;&s;es. In deep rich &s;oils, where the root meets no ob&s;truction, the &s;tem, we &s;uppo&s;e, grows &s;tately and erect: but when the root meets with a rocky &s;tratum, a hard and gravelly bed, or any other difficulty, through which it is obliged, in a zigzag cour&s;e to pick it's way, and &s;truggle for a pa&s;&s;age; the &s;ympathetic &s;tem, feeling every motion, pur&s;ues the &s;ame indirect cour&s;e above, which the root does below: and thus the &s;turdy plant,
<PB N="26" REF="44">
through the means of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous in|counters, and hardy conflicts, a&s;&s;umes form and character; and becomes, in a due cour&s;e of centuries, a picture&s;que tree.</P>
<P>Virgil has given us the picture of an oak, in which it's principal characteri&s;tics are well touched.</P>

<P>I &s;hall not enter into a critici&s;m on the word <HI>e&s;culus,</HI> which cannot on any good authority, I think, &s;ignify the beech; and Pliny's autho|rity, which I in&s;ert below<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pliny &s;peaking of the different kinds of trees, which were dedicated to different deities, tells us, Jovi e&s;culus, Apolloni laurus, &amp;c.

in favour of it's being the oak. But were it not &s;o, Virgil's de&s;cription is &s;o &s;trongly marked with the characters of the oak, that it &s;eems to put the matter out of di&s;pute; and I introduce the quotation, merely to bring together, in few words, the mo&s;t obvious qua|lities of this noble plant, in one point of view.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t characteri&s;tic, which Virgil men|tions, is it's <HI>firmne&s;s;</HI> or the power and &s;trength, with which it takes hold of the ground; driving it's tap-root, in the poet's language, even <HI>into the infernal regions.</HI> No tree re&s;i&s;ts the bla&s;t &s;o &s;teadily.

The &s;ea-air, like a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, attacks the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>A &s;econd characteri&s;tic of the oak, of which Virgil takes notice, is the <HI>&s;toutne&s;s of it's limbs;</HI> it's <HI>fortes ramos.</HI> We know no tree, except perhaps the cedar of Lebanon, &s;o remarkable in this re&s;pect. The limbs of mo&s;t trees <HI>&s;pring</HI> from the trunk. In the oak they may be rather &s;aid to <HI>divide</HI> from it; for they generally carry with them a great &s;hare of the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tem. You hardly know, which is &s;tem, and which is branch; and towards the top, the &s;tem is entirely lo&s;t in the branches. This gives particular propriety to the epithet <HI>fortes</HI> in characterizing the branches of the oak; and hence it's &s;inewy elbows are of &s;uch peculiar u&s;e in &s;hip-building. Whoever there|fore does not mark the <HI>fortes ramos</HI> of the oak, might as well in painting a Hercules, omit his mu&s;cles. But I &s;peak only of the hardy veterans of the fore&s;t. In the effeminate nur&s;|lings of the grove we have not this appearance. There the tree is all &s;tem, drawn up into height.

<P>The next characteri&s;tic of the oak taken notice of by the poet, is the <HI>twi&s;ting</HI> of it's branches: <HI>brachia tendit huc illuc.</HI> Examine the a&s;h, the elm, the beech, or almo&s;t any other tree; and you may ob&s;erve, in what direct, and &s;trait lines, the branches in each &s;hoot from the &s;tem. Whereas the limbs of an oak are continually twi&s;ting <HI>huc illuc,</HI> in various contortions; and like the cour&s;e of a river &s;port and play in every po&s;&s;ible di|rection; &s;ometimes in long reaches, and &s;ometimes in &s;horter elbows.

<P>Another peculiarity, of which Virgil takes notice in the oak, is it's <HI>expan&s;ive &s;pread.</HI>
<Q>Media ip&s;a ingentem &s;u&s;tinet umbram.</Q>
By <HI>ingentem umbram,</HI> I do not &s;uppo&s;e the poet means a thick, compact, clo&s;e-woven foliage, like that of the beech, which the oak &s;eldom exhibits. In general, except in very luxuriant &s;oils, the foliage of the oak is light,
<PB N="30" REF="48">
and thin. I &s;hould therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of a <HI>clo&s;e-woven</HI> &s;hade, the poet means an <HI>extended</HI> one; which indeed is implied in the expre&s;&s;ion, ju&s;t before u&s;ed, <HI>ramos late tendens.</HI> This indeed is a ju&s;t characteri&s;tic of the oak; for it's boughs, however twi&s;ted, continually take a horizontal direction, and over&s;hadow a large &s;pace of ground. Indeed, where it is fond of it's &s;ituation, and has room to &s;pread, it extends it&s;elf beyond any other tree; and like a monarch takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Virgilian characteri&s;tic of the oak is it's <HI>longevity;</HI> which extends, I &s;uppo&s;e, beyond that of any other tree.

Perhaps the yew may be an exception. I men|tion the circum&s;tance of it's longevity as it is of a nature &s;ingularly picture&s;que. It is through age, that the oak acquires it's greate&s;t beauty; which often continues increa&s;ing even into de|cay, if any proportion exi&s;ts between the &s;tem, and the branches.

<P>I have dwelt the longer on the oak, as it is confe&s;&s;edly both the mo&s;t picture&s;que tree in it&s;elf; and the mo&s;t accommodating in compo|&s;ition. It refu&s;es no &s;ubject either in natural, or in artificial land&s;cape. It is &s;uited to the grande&s;t; and may with propriety be intro|duced into the mo&s;t pa&s;toral. It adds new dignity to the ruined tower, and Gothic arch: by &s;tretching it's wild, mo&s;s-grown branches athwart their ivyed walls it gives them a kind of maje&s;ty coeval with it&s;elf: at the &s;ame time it's propriety is &s;till pre&s;erved, if it throw it's arms over the purling brook, or the mantling pool, where it beholds

<P><PB N="32" REF="50">After the oak, let us examine the a&s;h. This tree in point of utility, is little inferior to the oak. It's u&s;es are infinite. To the a&s;hen &s;pear the heroes of antiquity were in|debted for half their prowe&s;s. In the arts of peace, as well as of war, in architecture, tillage, and manufactures, the a&s;h objects to bu&s;ine&s;s of no kind: while even it's very refu&s;e &s;pars are accounted the be&s;t fuel in the fore&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome parts of the continent of Europe the a&s;hen billet &s;ells for one half more than any other wood, except beech.</NOTE>. The a&s;hen billet produces a &s;teady, bright, lambent flame; and as Mr. Evelin tells us, may be reckoned among the <GAP DESC="foreign">, fuel with little &s;moke.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes heard the oak called the Hercules of the fore&s;t; and the a&s;h, the Venus. The compari&s;on is not ami&s;s: for the oak joins the idea of &s;trength to beauty: while the a&s;h rather joins the ideas of beauty, and elegance. Virgil marks the character of the a&s;h, as particularly beautiful.</P>
<Q>Fraxinus in &s;ylvis pulcherrima&mdash;</Q>
<P><PB N="33" REF="51">The a&s;h generally carries it's principal &s;tem higher than the oak; and ri&s;es in an ea&s;y, flowing line. But it's chief beauty con&s;i&s;ts in the lightne&s;s of it's whole appearance. It's branches at fir&s;t keep clo&s;e to the trunk, and form acute angles with it: but as they begin to lengthen, they generally take an ea&s;y &s;weep; and the loo&s;ene&s;s of the leaves corre&s;ponding with the lightne&s;s of the &s;pray, the whole forms an elegant depending foliage. Nothing can have a better effect, than an old a&s;h, hanging from the corner of a wood, and bring|ing off the heavine&s;s of the other foliage, with it's loo&s;e pendent branches. And yet in &s;ome &s;oils, I have &s;een the a&s;h lo&s;e much of it's beauty in the decline of age. It's foliage becomes rare, and meagre; and it's branches, in&s;tead of hanging loo&s;ely, often &s;tart away in di&s;agreeable forms. In &s;hort, the a&s;h often lo&s;es that grandeur and beauty in old age, which the generality of trees, and particularly the oak, pre&s;erve, till a late period of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The a&s;h al&s;o, on another account, falls under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the picture&s;que eye. It's leaf is much tenderer, than that of the oak, and &s;ooner receives impre&s;&s;ion from the
<PB N="34" REF="52">
winds, and fro&s;t. In&s;tead of contributing it's tint therefore in the wane of the year among the many-coloured offspring of the woods, it &s;hrinks from the bla&s;t, drops it's leaf, and in each &s;cene where it predominates, leaves wide blanks of de&s;olated boughs, amid&s;t foliage yet fre&s;h, and verdant. Before it's decay, we &s;ometimes &s;ee it's leaf tinged with a fine yellow, well contra&s;ted with the neighbouring greens. But this is one of nature's ca&s;ual beauties. Much oftener it's leaf decays in a dark, muddy, unplea&s;ing tint. And yet &s;ometimes, notwith|&s;tanding this early lo&s;s of it's foliage, we &s;ee the a&s;h, in a &s;heltered &s;ituation, when the rains have been abundant, and the &s;ea&s;on mild, retain it's green, (a light plea&s;ant green) when the oak and the elm, in it's neighbourhood, have put on their autumnal attire.</P>
<P>Another di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance attends the a&s;h, which is indeed it's misfortune, rather than it's fault. It's leaf and rind are nutritrive to deer; and much u&s;ed in browzing them in &s;ummer. The keepers of the fore&s;t there|fore &s;eek out all the a&s;h-trees they can find, which are for this purpo&s;e mangled, and de|formed.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="53">One thing more I &s;hould mention with regard to the a&s;h, as it is of a picture&s;que nature, and that is the beauty of it's roots, which are often finely veined, and will take a good poli&s;h. Dr. Plot, in his natural hi&s;tory of Oxford&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. vi. &s;ec. 80.</NOTE>, &s;peaks of certain knotty ex|cre&s;cences in the a&s;h, called the <HI>bru&s;ca,</HI> and <HI>mollu&s;ca,</HI> which when cut, and poli&s;hed, are very beautiful. He particularly mentions a dining table, made of the latter, which repre|&s;ents the exact figure of a fi&s;h.</P>
<P>With regard to the&s;e <HI>exact figures</HI> of animals, and other objects, which we meet with both in &s;tone, and wood, I cannot &s;ay I &s;hould value them much as objects of beauty. They may be whim&s;ical, and curious; but in my opinion, the roots, and veins of wood, and &s;tone, are much more beautiful, when they are wreathed in different fanta&s;tic forms; than when they <HI>&s;eem to aim</HI> at any <HI>exact figures.</HI> In the former ca&s;e they leave the imagination at liberty to play among them; which is always a plea&s;ing exerci&s;e to it: in the latter, they are at be&s;t awkward, and
<PB N="36" REF="54">
unnatural likene&s;&s;es; which often di&s;gu&s;t the picture&s;que eye; and always plea&s;e it le&s;s, than following it's own fancy, and picking out re&s;emblances of it's own.</P>
<P>Another curio&s;ity in the a&s;h, which is likewi&s;e of the picture&s;que kind, is a &s;ort of excre&s;cence, which is &s;ometimes found on a leading branch, called a <HI>wreathed fa&s;cia.</HI> The fa&s;ciated branch is twi&s;ted, and curled in a very beautiful form; which form it probably takes, as Dr. Plot &s;uppo&s;es, from too quick an a&s;cent of the &s;ap <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Nat. hi&s;t. Oxf. ch. vi. &s;ec. 82.</NOTE>: or as other naturali&s;ts imagine, from the puncture of &s;ome in&s;ect in the tender twig, which diverts the &s;ap from it's u&s;ual channel, and makes the branch mon&s;trous. The wreathed fa&s;cia is &s;ometimes found in other wood, in the willow parti|cularly, and in the holly; but mo&s;t com|monly is an excre&s;cence of the a&s;h. I have a fa&s;ciated branch of a&s;h, found in the woods of Beaulieu in new-fore&s;t, which is mo&s;t elegantly twi&s;ted in the form of a crozier. I have &s;een a holly al&s;o twi&s;ted like a ram's
<PB N="37" REF="55">
horn. We have this appearance &s;ometimes in a&s;paragus.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for the &s;eeds of trees, and particularly of the a&s;h, to &s;eize on &s;ome faulty part of a neighbouring trunk, and there &s;trike root. Dr. Plot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Nat. hi&s;t. Oxf. ch. vi. &s;ec. 79.</NOTE> &s;peaks of a piece of vegetable violence of this kind, which is rather extraordinary. An a&s;h-key rooting it&s;elf on a decayed willow; and finding, as it increa&s;ed, a deficiency of nouri&s;h|ment in the mother plant, it began to in&s;inuate it's fibres by degrees through the trunk of the willow into the earth. There receiving an additional recruit, it began to thrive, and expand it&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;ize, that it bur&s;t the willow in pieces, which fell away from it; and what was before the root of the a&s;h, being now expo&s;ed to the air, became the &s;olid trunk of a vigorous tree.</P>
<P>As a beautiful variety of the tree we are now examining, the <HI>mountain-a&s;h,</HI> often called the <HI>roan tree,</HI> &s;hould be mentioned. It's name denotes the place of it's u&s;ual re&s;idence. Inured to cold, and rugged &s;cenes, it is the
<PB N="38" REF="56">
hardy inhabitant of the northern parts of this i&s;land. Sometimes it is found in &s;ofter climes: but there it generally di&s;covers by it's &s;tunted growth, that it does not occupy the &s;ituation it loves.</P>
<P>In ancient days, when &s;uper&s;tition held that place in &s;ociety, which di&s;&s;ipation, and impiety now hold, the mountain-a&s;h was con&s;idered as an object of great veneration. Often at this day, a &s;tump of it is found in &s;ome old burying place; or near the circle of a Druid temple, who&s;e rites it formerly inve&s;ted with it's &s;acred &s;hade. It's chief merit now con&s;i&s;ts in being the ornament of land&s;cape. In the Scoti&s;h highlands it becomes a con&s;iderable tree. There on &s;ome rocky mountain covered with dark pines, and waving birch, which ca&s;t a &s;olemn gloom over the lake below, a few mountain-a&s;hes joining in a clump, and mixing with them, have a fine effect. In &s;ummer, the light green tint of their foliage; and in autumn, the glowing berries, which hang clu&s;tering upon them, contra&s;t beauti|fully with the deeper green of the pines: and if they are happily blended; and not in too large a proportion, they add &s;ome of the mo&s;t picture&s;que furniture, with which
<PB N="39" REF="57">
the &s;ides of tho&s;e rugged mountains are in|ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>After the oak, and a&s;h, we examine the elm. The oak and the a&s;h have each a di&s;tinct character. The ma&s;&s;y form of the one, di|viding into abrupt, twi&s;ting, irregular limbs, yet compact in it's foliage; and the ea&s;y &s;weep of the other, the &s;implicity of it's branches, and the loo&s;ene&s;s of it's hanging leaves, cha|racterize both the&s;e trees with &s;o much pre|ci&s;ion, that at any di&s;tance, at which the eye can di&s;tingui&s;h the form, it may al&s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;h the difference. The elm has not &s;o di&s;|tinct a character. It partakes &s;o much of the oak; that when it is rough, and old, it may ea&s;ily, at a little di&s;tance, be mi&s;taken for one: tho the oak, I mean &s;uch an oak as is &s;trongly marked with it's peculiar cha|racter, can never be mi&s;taken for the elm. This is certainly a defect in the elm; for &s;trong characters are a great &s;ource of pic|ture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>This defect however appears chiefly in the &s;keleton of the elm. In full foliage, it's character is better marked. No tree is better
<PB N="40" REF="58">
adapted to receive grand ma&s;&s;es of light. In this re&s;pect it is &s;uperior, both to the oak, and the a&s;h. Nor is it's foliage, &s;hadowing as it is, of the heavy kind. It's leaves are &s;mall, and this gives it a natural lightne&s;s: it commonly hangs loo&s;ely; and is in general, very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The elm naturally grows upright; and when it meets with a &s;oil it loves, ri&s;es higher than the generality of trees; and after it has a&s;&s;umed the dignity, and hoary roughne&s;s of age, few of it's fore&s;t-brethren (tho, properly &s;peaking, it is not a fore&s;ter) excel it in gran|deur, and beauty.</P>
<P>The elm is the fir&s;t tree, that &s;alutes the early &s;pring with it's light, and cheerful green &mdash;a tint, which contra&s;ts agreeably with the oak, who&s;e early leaf has generally more of the olive-ca&s;t. We &s;ee them &s;ometimes in fine harmony together, about the end of april, and the beginning of may. We often al&s;o &s;ee the elm planted with the Scotch fir. In the &s;pring it's light green is very di&s;cordant with the gloomy hue of it's companion: but as the year advances, the elm-leaf takes a darker tint, and unites in harmony with the fir.&mdash;In autumn al&s;o the yellow leaf of
<PB N="41" REF="59">
the elm mixes as kindly with the orange of the beech, the ocher of the oak, and many of the other fading hues of the wood.</P>
<P>A &s;pecies of this tree, called the wich-elm, is perhaps generally more picture&s;que, than the common &s;ort; as it hangs more negligently: tho, at the &s;ame time, with this negligence, it lo&s;es in a good degree, that happy &s;urface for catching ma&s;&s;es of light, which we admire in the common elm. We ob&s;erve al&s;o, when we &s;ee this tree in company with the common elm, that it's bark is &s;ome|what of a lighter hue. The wich-elm is a native of Scotland, where it is found not only in the plains, and vallies of the low|lands; but is hardy enough to climb the &s;teeps, and flouri&s;h in the remote&s;t highlands: tho it does not attain, in tho&s;e climates, the &s;ize, which it attains in England. Naturali&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e the wich-elm to be the only &s;pecies of this tree, which is indigenous to our i&s;land.</P>
<P>There is another variety al&s;o of this tree, called the weeping elm. Whether it's timber is le&s;s u&s;eful, or it is propagated with greater difficulty, I know not; but I have rarely met with it. The fine&s;t of this &s;pecies I have &s;een, grow in St. John's walks at Cambridge. An
<PB N="42" REF="60">
eye accu&s;tomed to the tree, will ea&s;ily perceive that it's branches are more pen&s;ile, and it's leaves of &s;maller dimen&s;ions, than tho&s;e of the common elm.</P>
<P>An old elm, which grew formerly in the grove at Magdalen college in Oxford, was by &s;ome accident di&s;barked entirely round. A malady of this kind is generally reckoned fatal to all the vegetable race. But this tree flouri&s;hed after it, as well as any tree in the grove. The probable rea&s;ons of this uncom|mon appearance are given us by the learned author of the natural hi&s;tory of Oxford&s;hire, in a long philo&s;ophical enquiry, which may be found in the 166th page of that work. I have heard al&s;o, but I know not on what authority, of another di&s;barked elm, growing, at this time, vigorou&s;ly at Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P>The oak, the a&s;h, and the elm, are com|monly dignified, in our Engli&s;h woods, as a di&s;tinct cla&s;s, by the title of <HI>timber-trees.</HI> But the picture&s;que eye &s;corns the narrow concep|tions of a timber-merchant; and with equal complacency takes in the whole offspring of the wood: tho it mu&s;t be owned, the three
<PB N="43" REF="61">
&s;pecies already characterized, are both the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and the mo&s;t picture&s;que. We e&s;teem it fortunate, when the idea of picture&s;que beauty coincides with that of utility. The two ideas are often at variance. When they are &s;o, we cannot help it; but mu&s;t feel it with regret.</P>
<P>After timber trees, the beech de&s;erves our notice. Some indeed rank the beech among timber-trees; but, I believe, in general it does not find that re&s;pect; as it's wood is of a &s;oft, &s;pungy nature; &s;appy, and alluring to the worm.</P>
<P>In point of picture&s;que beauty I am not inclined to rank the beech much higher, than in point of utility. It's &s;keleton, compared with that of the trees we have ju&s;t examined, is very deficient. It's trunk, we allow, is often highly picture&s;que. It is &s;tudded with bold knobs and projections; and has &s;ometimes a &s;ort of irregular fluting about it, which is very characteri&s;tic. It has another peculiarity al&s;o, which is &s;ometimes plea&s;ing; that of a number of &s;tems ari&s;ing from the root. The bark too wears often a plea&s;ant hue. It is naturally of a dingy olive; but it is always over&s;pread, in patches, with a variety of
<PB N="44" REF="62">
mo&s;&s;es, and lychens, which are commonly of a lighter tint, in the upper parts; and of a deep velvet-green towards the root. It's &s;moothne&s;s al&s;o contra&s;ts agreeably with the&s;e rougher appendages. No bark tempts the lover &s;o much to make it the depo&s;itory of his mi&s;tre&s;s's name. It conveys a happy emblem:
<Q>&mdash;cre&s;cent illae; cre&s;cetis amores.</Q></P>
<P>But having prai&s;ed the trunk, we can prai&s;e no other part of the &s;keleton. The branches are fanta&s;tically wreathed, and di&s;proportioned; twining awkwardly among each other; and running often into long unvaried lines, without any of that &s;trength and firmne&s;s, which we admire in the oak; or of that ea&s;y &s;implicity which plea&s;es in the a&s;h: in &s;hort, we rarely &s;ee a beech well ramified. In full leaf it is equally unplea&s;ing; it has the appearance of an overgrown bu&s;h. Virgil indeed was right in chu&s;ing the beech for it's &s;hade. No tree forms &s;o complete a roof. If you wi&s;h either for &s;hade, or &s;helter, you will find it be&s;t <Q>&mdash;patulae &s;ub tegmine fagi.</Q></P>
<P>This bu&s;hine&s;s gives a great heavine&s;s to the tree; which is always a deformity. What
<PB N="45" REF="63">
lightne&s;s it has, di&s;gu&s;ts. You will &s;ome|times &s;ee a light branch i&s;&s;uing from a heavy ma&s;s: and tho &s;uch pendent branches are often beautiful in them&s;elves; they are &s;eldom in harmony with the tree. They di&s;tingui&s;h however it's character, which will be &s;een be&s;t by comparing it with the elm. The elm forms a rounder; the beech a more pointed foliage. But the former is always in harmony with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sometimes however we &s;ee in beeches of happy compo&s;ition, the foliage falling in large flocks, or layers elegantly determined; between which, the &s;hadows have a very forcible effect, e&s;pecially when the tree is &s;trongly illumined. On the whole, however the ma&s;&s;y, full-grown, luxuriant beech is rather a di&s;plea&s;ing tree. It is made up of littlene&s;&s;es &s;eldom exhibiting tho&s;e tufted cups, or hollow dark rece&s;&s;es, which di&s;part the &s;everal grand branches of the more beautiful kinds of trees.</P>
<P>Contrary to the general nature of trees, the beech is mo&s;t plea&s;ing in it's juvenile &s;tate; as it has not yet acquired that heavine&s;s, which is it's mo&s;t faulty di&s;tinction. A light, airy, young beech, with it's &s;piry branches, hang|ing, as I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed them, in ea&s;y
<PB N="46" REF="64">
forms, is often beautiful. I have &s;een al&s;o the fore&s;t-beech, in a dry, hungry &s;oil, pre&s;erve the lightne&s;s of youth, in the matu|rity of age.</P>
<P>After all however, we mean not to repudiate even the heavy, luxuriant beech in picture&s;que compo&s;ition. It has &s;ometimes it's beauty, and oftener it's u&s;e. In di&s;tance it pre&s;erves the depth of the fore&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We call the fore&s;t <HI>deep,</HI> when we cannot &s;ee through it; &s;o that at a di&s;tance a thin wood of beeches will have the effect of a large one.</NOTE>; and even on the &s;pot, in contra&s;t, it is frequently a choice accompaniment. In the corner of a land&s;cape, when we want a thick heavy tree, or part of one at lea&s;t, which is often nece&s;&s;ary, nothing an&s;wers our purpo&s;e like the beech.&mdash; But at pre&s;ent we are not con&s;idering the beech in compo&s;ition; but only as an individual; and in this light it is in which we chiefly con|ceive it as an object of di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not conclude our remarks on the beech without mentioning it's autumnal hues. In this re&s;pect it is often beautiful. Sometimes it is dre&s;&s;ed in mode&s;t brown; but generally in glowing orange: and in both
<PB N="47" REF="65">
dre&s;&s;es it's harmony with the grove, is plea|&s;ing. About the end of &s;eptember, when the leaf begins to change, it makes a happy contra&s;t with the oak, who&s;e foliage is yet verdant. Some of the fine&s;t oppo&s;itions of tint, which perhaps the fore&s;t can furni&s;h, ari&s;e from the union of oak, and beech. We often &s;ee a wonderful effect from this combi|nation. And yet accommodating as it's leaf is in land&s;cape, on handling, it feels as if it were fabricated with metallic rigour. In it's autumnal &s;tate it almo&s;t crackles:
<Q>&mdash;Leni crepitabat bractea vento.</Q>
For this rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, as it's rigour gives it an ela&s;tic quality, the common people in France, and Switzerland u&s;e it for their beds.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on the beech, as notwith&s;tanding my &s;everity, it is a tree of picture&s;que fame; and I did not chu&s;e to condemn, without giving my rea&s;ons. It has acquired it's reputation, I &s;uppo&s;e, chiefly from it's having a peculiar character; and this, with all it's defects, it certainly has. I may add al&s;o, that if objects receive merit from their a&s;&s;ociated, as well as from their intrin&s;ic qualities, the dry &s;oil, and &s;alubrious air, in

which the beech generally flouri&s;hes, give it a high degree of e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Very nearly allied to the beech in a pic|ture&s;que light, is the horn-beam. It grows like it, when it is &s;uffered to grow; but it is generally &s;een only in clipped hedges, where it is very obedient to the knife; and with a little care will never pre&s;ume to appear out of form. It's wood is white, tough, and flexible.</P>
<P>The deciduous trees, which I have de&s;|cribed, hold certainly the fir&s;t rank. I &s;hall however touch on a few others, which tho neither &s;o beautiful, nor &s;o characteri&s;tic, are however worth the notice of the picture&s;que eye.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e the fir&s;t place is due to two noble trees of the &s;ame kind, both naturalized in England&mdash;tho from different extremes of the globe&mdash;the <HI>occidental</HI> and the <HI>oriental</HI> plane.</P>
<P>The <HI>occidental</HI> plane is a native of America; but has long been known in England; where it attains a con&s;iderable growth; tho inferior,
<PB N="49" REF="67">
no doubt, to what it attains in it's native &s;oil. It's &s;tem is very picture&s;que. It is &s;mooth, and of a light a&s;h-colour; and has the pro|perty of throwing off it's bark in &s;cales; thus naturally clean&s;ing it&s;elf, at lea&s;t it's larger boughs, from mo&s;s, and other para&s;itical incumbrances. This would be no recom|mendation of it in a picture&s;que light, if the removal of the&s;e incumbrances did not &s;ub|&s;titute as great a beauty in their room. The&s;e &s;cales are very irregular; falling off &s;ometimes in one part; and &s;ometimes in another: and as the under-bark is, immediately after it's exco|riation, of a lighter hue than the upper, it offers to the pencil tho&s;e &s;mart touches, which have &s;o much effect in painting. The&s;e flakes however would be more beautiful, if they fell off in a circular form, in&s;tead of a perpendi|cular one. They would corre&s;pond, and unite better with the circular form of the bole.</P>
<P>No tree forms a more plea&s;ing &s;hade than the occidental plane. It is full-leafed, and it's leaf is large, &s;mooth, of a fine texture, and &s;eldom injured by in&s;ects. It's lower branches &s;hooting horizontally, &s;oon take a direction to the ground; and the &s;pray &s;eems more &s;edulous, than that of any tree we have, by twi&s;ting
<PB N="50" REF="68">
about in various forms, to fill up every little vacuity with &s;hade. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be owned, the twi&s;ting of it's branches is a di&s;advantage to this tree, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved it is to the beech, when it is &s;tripped of it's leaves, and reduced to a &s;keleton.&mdash;It has not the natural appearance, which the &s;pray of the oak, and that of many other trees di&s;covers in winter. Nor indeed does it's foliage, from the largene&s;s of the leaf, and the mode of it's growth, make the mo&s;t picture&s;que appearance in &s;ummer.&mdash;One of the fine&s;t occidental planes I am acquainted with, &s;tands in my own garden at Vicar's-hill; where it's boughs, feathering to the ground, form a canopy of above fifty feet in diameter.</P>
<P>The <HI>oriental</HI> plane is a tree nearly of the &s;ame kind; only it's leaf is more palmated, nor has it &s;o great a di&s;po&s;ition to over&s;hadow the ground, as the occidental plane. At lea&s;t I never &s;aw any in our climate form &s;o noble a &s;hade; tho in the ea&s;t, it is e&s;teemed among the mo&s;t &s;hady, and mo&s;t magnificent of trees. Lady Craven &s;peaks of &s;ome &s;he &s;aw in the Turki&s;h dominions of a &s;ize &s;o gigantic, that
<PB N="51" REF="69">
the large&s;t trees we have in England placed near them, would appear, &s;he &s;ays, only like broom&s;ticks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This tree I believe &s;heds it's bark like the occidental plane; and the catkins of both are round, &s;picated balls, about the &s;ize of wal|nuts; and fa&s;tened together often in pairs, like chain-&s;hot. From this circum&s;tance, the occidental plane is called in America, the button-tree. It flouri&s;hes there commonly by the &s;ides of creeks, and rivers; and is of quick growth. The oriental plane, I believe, loves the &s;ame &s;oil: at lea&s;t both trees in England are fond of moi&s;t ground.</P>
<P>Kempfer tells us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 524.</NOTE>, that at Jedo the capital of Japan, he found a &s;pecies of this tree, the leaves of which were beautifully variegated, like the tricolor, with red, green, and yellow. An appearance of this kind is &s;o contrary to nature's u&s;ual mode of colouring the leaves of fore&s;t-trees; that I &s;hould rather &s;u&s;pect, Kempfer &s;aw it, either when the leaves were in the wane, or bla&s;ted, or in &s;ome other unnatural &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="70">I may add, with regard to the occidental plane; and indeed, I believe, with regard to both the trees of this &s;pecies, that their &s;um|mer leaf wears &s;o light a hue, as to mix ill with the foliage of the oak, the elm, and other trees. I have &s;een them on the &s;kirts of a plantation, forming, during the &s;ummer, a di&s;agreeable &s;pot. In autumn, their leaves receive a mellow tint, which harmonizes very well with the waning colour of the wood.</P>
<P>The poplar tribe &s;hall be con&s;idered next. They are numerous, and &s;ome of them I have thought picture&s;que. They are at lea&s;t &s;tately trees: but their thin quivering foliage is neither adapted to catch ma&s;&s;es of light, like that of the elm; nor has it the hanging lightne&s;s of the a&s;h. It's chief u&s;e in land&s;cape is to mix as a variety, in contra&s;t with other trees.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e few years the Lombardy-poplar, which graces the banks of the Po, has been much introduced in Engli&s;h planta|tations. It &s;eems to like a Briti&s;h &s;oil; and it's youth is promi&s;ing: but I have never &s;een it in full maturity. It's conic form as
<PB N="53" REF="71">
a deciduous tree, is peculiar. Among ever|greens we find the &s;ame character in the cy|pre&s;s; and both trees in many &s;ituations have a good effect. The cypre&s;s often, among the ruins of ancient Rome, breaks the re|gularity of a wall, or a pediment by it's conic form: and the poplar on the banks of the Po, no doubt has the &s;ame effect among it's deciduous brethren, by forming the apex of a clump: tho I have been told that, in it's age, it lo&s;es it's &s;hape in &s;ome degree, and &s;preads more into a head. The olde&s;t poplars of this kind I have &s;een, are at Blenheim. They are not old trees; but are very tall; and, I believe &s;till pre&s;erve their &s;piry form.</P>
<P>One beauty the Italian poplar po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, which is almo&s;t peculiar to it&s;elf; and that is the waving line it forms, when agitated by wind. Mo&s;t trees in this circum&s;tance are partially agitated. One &s;ide is at re&s;t; while the other, is in motion. But the Italian poplar waves in one &s;imple &s;weep from the top to the bottom, like an o&s;trich-feather on a lady's head. All the branches coin|cide in the motion: and the lea&s;t bla&s;t makes an impre&s;&s;ion upon it, when other
<PB N="54" REF="72">
trees are at re&s;t. I have mentioned, among the adventitious beauties of trees, their <HI>&s;u&s;ceptibility of motion:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 20.</NOTE> but in painting I know not, that I &s;hould repre&s;ent any kind of motion in a tree, except that of a violent &s;torm. When the bla&s;t continues for &s;ome time; when the black heavens are in uni&s;on with it, and help to tell the &s;tory, an oak &s;training in the wind, is an object of picture&s;que beauty. But when the gentle breeze, pre&s;&s;ing upon the quivering poplar, bends it only in ea&s;y motion, while a &s;erene &s;ky indicates the heavens to be at peace, there is nothing to act in concert with the motion of the tree: it &s;eems to have taken it's form from the influence of a &s;ea air, or &s;ome other malign impre&s;&s;ion; and exhibiting an unnatural ap|pearance, di&s;gu&s;ts.&mdash;One thing more I &s;hould mention with regard to the Italian poplar, which is, that altho it &s;ometimes has a good effect, when &s;tanding &s;ingle; it generally has a better, when two or three are planted in a clump.</P>
<P>The walnut is not an unpicture&s;que tree. The warm, ru&s;&s;et hue of it's young foliage
<PB N="55" REF="73">
makes a plea&s;ing variety among the vivid green of other trees, about the end of may: and the &s;ame variety is maintained in &s;ummer, by the contra&s;t of it's yellowi&s;h hue, when mixed in any quantity, with trees of a darker tint: but it opens it's leaves &s;o late, and drops them &s;o early, that it cannot long be in harmony with the grove. It &s;tands be&s;t alone, and the early lo&s;s of it's foliage is of the le&s;s con&s;equence, as it's ramification is generally beautiful.</P>
<P>The lime is an elegant tree, where it is &s;uffered to grow at large: but we generally &s;ee it in &s;trait bondage, clipped into &s;hape, and forming the &s;ides of avenues, and vi&s;tas. In it's be&s;t &s;tate however it is not very pic|ture&s;que. It has a uniformity of &s;urface, without any of tho&s;e breaks, and hollows, which the foliage of the mo&s;t picture&s;|que trees pre&s;ents; and which is always beautiful.&mdash;One circum&s;tance &s;hould recom|mend the lime to all lovers of the imitative arts. No wood is &s;o ea&s;ily formed under the carver's chi&s;&s;el. It is the wood, which the ingenious Gibbon u&s;ed, after making trial of
<PB N="56" REF="74">
&s;everal kinds, as the mo&s;t proper for that curious &s;culpture, which adorns &s;ome of the old hou&s;es of our nobility.</P>
<P>The maple is an uncommon tree, tho a common bu&s;h. It's wood is of little value; and it is therefore rarely &s;uffered to increa&s;e. We &s;eldom &s;ee it employed in any nobler &s;er|vice, than in filling up it's part in a hedge, in company with thorns, and briars, and other ditch trumpery. Yet the ancients held it in great repute. Pliny <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plin. Nat. hi&s;t. lib. xvi. ch. 16.</NOTE> &s;peaks as highly of the knobs, and excre&s;cences of this tree, called the <HI>bru&s;ca</HI> and <HI>mollu&s;ca,</HI> as Dr. Plot does of tho&s;e of the a&s;h<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 35: &s;ee al&s;o Plin. Nat. hi&s;t. lib. xiii. ch. 15.</NOTE>. The veins of the&s;e excre&s;cences in the maple, Pliny tells us, were &s;o variegated, that they exceeded the beauty of any other wood; even of the citron: tho the citron was in &s;uch repute at Rome, that Cicero, who was neither rich, nor expen&s;ive, was tempted to give ten
<PB N="57" REF="75">
thou&s;and &s;e&s;terces for a citron table. The bru&s;ca and mollu&s;ca, Pliny adds, were rarely of &s;ize &s;ufficient for the larger &s;pecies of fur|niture; but in all &s;maller cabinet work they were ine&s;timable. But indeed the whole tree was e&s;teemed by the ancients, on account of it's variegated wood. In Ovid we find it thus celebrated:
<Q>&mdash;acerque coloribus impar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Met. lib. x. v. 1.</NOTE>.</Q>
How far at this day, it may be valued for cabinet work, I know not. I have, here and there, &s;een boxes, and other little things made of it, which I have thought very beautiful.</P>
<P>In the few in&s;tances I have met with of this tree in a &s;tate of maturity, it's form has appeared picture&s;que. It is not unlike the oak: only it is more bu&s;hy; and it's branches clo&s;er, and more compact. One of the large&s;t maples I have &s;een, &s;tands in the church-yard of Boldre, in the New-fore&s;t: but I have not met with &s;pecimens enough of this tree to form an opinion of it's general character.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="76">The great maple, commonly called the <HI>&s;ycamore,</HI> is a grander, and nobler tree, than the &s;maller maple; but it wants it's elegance: it is coar&s;e in proportion to it's bulk. It forms however an impenetrable &s;hade; and often receives well-contra&s;ted ma&s;&s;es of light. It's bark has not the furrowed roughne&s;s of the oak; but it has a &s;pecies of roughne&s;s very picture&s;que. In it&s;elf, it is &s;mooth: but it peels off in large flakes, like the planes, (to which in other re&s;pects, it bears a near alliance) leaving patches of different hues, &s;eams, and cracks, which are often pic|ture&s;que.</P>
<P>The che&s;nut in maturity and perfection, is a noble tree; and grows not unlike the oak. It's ramification is more &s;traggling; but it is ea&s;y, and it's foliage loo&s;e. This is the tree, which graces the land&s;capes of Salvator Ro&s;a. In the mountains of Calabria, where Salvator painted, the che&s;nut flouri&s;hed. There he &s;tudied it in all it's forms, breaking and di&s;|po&s;ing it in a thou&s;and beautiful &s;hapes, as
<PB N="59" REF="77">
the exigences of his compo&s;ition required. I have heard indeed that it is naturally brittle, and liable to be &s;hattered by winds; which might be one rea&s;on for Salvator's attachment to it.&mdash;But altho I have many times &s;een the che&s;nut in England, old enough to be in a fruit-bearing &s;tate; yet I have &s;eldom &s;een it in a &s;tate of full picture&s;que maturity. The be&s;t I have &s;een, &s;tand on the banks of the Tamer in Cornwall, at an old hou&s;e, belong|ing to the Edgecumbe family. I have heard al&s;o that at Beechworth-ca&s;tle, in Surry, there are not fewer than &s;eventy or eighty che&s;nuts, mea&s;uring from twelve to eighteen or twenty feet in girth, and &s;ome of them of very pic|ture&s;que form: but I &s;aw them only at a di&s;tance. In Kent al&s;o the che&s;nut is fre|quently found.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid indeed, that this tree was once very common in England, and that beams of it are often &s;een at this day, in churches, and old hou&s;es. In the belfry particularly of the church at Sutton, near Mitcham in Surry, I have &s;een beams, which are like oak; yet plainly appear to be of a different kind of timber; and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be che&s;nut. I have often heard al&s;o, that the timber of the
<PB N="60" REF="78">
old hou&s;es of London was of the &s;ame kind. Whether the che&s;nut was ever indigenous to this country &s;eems to be matter of much &s;pecu|lation. As it's timber is &s;aid to be &s;erviceable, and as it's fruit, tho rarely of perfect growth in this climate, might however be of &s;ome u&s;e; we are at a lo&s;s to conceive, if it had once gotten footing among&s;t us, how it &s;hould ever be, as it now is, almo&s;t totally extermi|nated. Some have endeavoured to account for this, by &s;hewing, that it is not &s;o good a timber-tree, as is &s;uppo&s;ed; for it decays at the heart; and will continue decaying, till it become merely a &s;hell, and for this rea&s;on it has been le&s;s &s;ought after, and encouraged. How far this may be true I know not. I rather &s;u&s;pect it's truth. Some years ago Mr. Daines Barrington read a paper to the royal &s;ociety, in which he endeavoured to prove, that the che&s;nut was not indigenous to this country. Dr. Ducarel an&s;wered him, and alleged from ancient records, and other evi|denees, that che&s;nut formerly abounded in many woody &s;cenes in England; and was certainly a native of this i&s;land. Among the ancient records, to which he appeals, one is dated in the time of Henry II. It is a deed
<PB N="61" REF="79">
of gift from that prince, to Flexley abbey, of the tythe of all his che&s;nuts in the fore&s;t of Dean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See four letters on che&s;nut-trees, read before the royal &s;ociety 1771.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e-che&s;nut is a heavy, di&s;agreeable tree. It forms it's foliage generally in a round ma&s;s, with little appearance of tho&s;e breaks, which we have &s;o often admired; and which contribute to give an airine&s;s and lightne&s;s, at lea&s;t a richne&s;s, and variety to the whole ma&s;s of foliage. This tree is however chiefly admired for it's flower, which <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> is beau|tiful: but the whole tree together in flower is a glaring object, totally unharmonious, and unpicture&s;que. In &s;ome &s;ituations indeed, and among a profu&s;ion of other wood, a &s;ingle che&s;nut or two, in bloom, may be beautiful. As it forms an admirable &s;hade, it may be of u&s;e too in thickening di&s;tant &s;cenery; or in &s;kreening an object at hand: for there is no &s;pecies of foliage, however heavy, nor any &s;pecies of bloom, however glaring, which may
<PB N="62" REF="80">
not be brought, by &s;ome proper contra&s;t, to produce a good effect.</P>
<P>The weeping willow is a very picture&s;que tree. It is a perfect contra&s;t to what we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved of the Lombardy poplar. The light, airy &s;pray of the poplar ri&s;es perpendi|cularly. That of the weeping willow is pendent. The &s;hape of it's leaf is conformable to the pen&s;ile character of the tree; and it's &s;pray, which is &s;till lighter than that of the poplar, is more ea&s;ily put into motion by a breath of air. The weeping willow however is not adapted to &s;ublime &s;ubjects. We wi&s;h it not to &s;kreen the broken buttre&s;&s;es, and Gothic windows of an abbey, nor to over-&s;hadow the battlements of a ruined ca&s;tle. The&s;e offices it re&s;igns to the oak; who&s;e dignity can &s;upport them. The weeping willow &s;eeks a humbler &s;cene&mdash;&s;ome romantic foot-path bridge, which it half conceals&mdash;or &s;ome gla&s;&s;y pool, over which it hangs it's &s;treaming foliage;
<Q><L>&mdash;and dip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>It's pendent boughs, &s;tooping as if to drink.</L></Q>
<PB N="63" REF="81">
In the&s;e &s;ituations it appears in character; and of cour&s;e, to advantage.&mdash;I have heard indeed that the weeping willow is not naturally an aquatic plant; but it's being commonly be|lieved to be &s;o, is ground enough to e&s;tabli&s;h it as &s;uch, in land&s;cape at lea&s;t, tho not in botany.</P>
<P>The weeping willow is the only one of it's tribe, that is beautiful. Botani&s;ts, I believe, enumerate &s;ixteen &s;pecies of the willow. But tho I have &s;een &s;ome of them attain a very remarkable &s;ize; yet in general they are trees of &s;traggling ramification, and without any of that elegant &s;treaming form, which we admire in the weep|ing willow. I &s;hould rarely therefore advi&s;e their u&s;e in artificial land&s;cape; except as pol|lards to characterize a mar&s;hy country; or to mark in a &s;econd di&s;tance, the winding banks of a heavy, low-&s;unk river, which could not otherwi&s;e be noticed. Some willows indeed I have thought beautiful, and fit to appear in the decoration of any rural &s;cene. The kind I have mo&s;t admired, has a &s;mall narrow leaf, and wears a plea&s;ant, light, &s;ea green tint; which mixes agreeably with foliage of a deeper hue. I am not acquainted with the botanical
<PB N="64" REF="82">
name of this &s;pecies, but I believe the botani&s;ts call it the <HI>&s;alix alba.</HI></P>
<P>The withy, or <HI>&s;alix fragilis,</HI> is the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of it's tribe. Like others of it's kindred, it will grow in any &s;oil; tho it loves a moi&s;t one. It is of little value in land&s;cape, and yet there is &s;omething beauti|ful in it's &s;ilver-coated catkins; which open, as the year advances, into elegant hanging tufts; and when the tree is large, and in full bloom, make a beautiful variety among the early productions of the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Nearly related to the willow tribe, tho in nature rather than in form, is the <HI>alder.</HI> They both love a low moi&s;t &s;oil; and frequent the banks of rivers; tho it may be alledged in favour of both, that they will flouri&s;h in the poore&s;t fore&s;t &s;wamps, where nothing el&s;e will grow. The alder is however the more picture&s;que tree, both in it's ramification, and in it's foliage; perhaps indeed it is the mo&s;t picture&s;que of any of the aquatic tribe, except the weeping willow. He who would &s;ee the
<PB N="65" REF="83">
alder in perfection, mu&s;t follow the banks of the Mole in Surry, through the &s;weet vales of Dorking, and Mickleham, into the groves of E&s;her. The Mole indeed is far from being a beautiful river: it is a &s;ilent and &s;luggi&s;h &s;tream. But what beauty it has, it owes greatly to the alder; which every where fringes it's meadows, and in many places forms very plea&s;ing &s;cenes; e&s;pecially in the vale between Box-hill, and the high grounds of Norbury-park.</P>
<P>Some of the large&s;t alders we have in England, grow in the bi&s;hop of Durham's park at Bi&s;hop-Aukland. The generality of trees acquire picture&s;que beauty by age: but it is not often that they are &s;uffered to attain this picture&s;que period. Some u&s;e is commonly found for them long before that time. The oak falls for the greater purpo&s;es of man; and the alder is ready to &s;upply a variety of his &s;maller wants. An old tree therefore of any kind is a curio&s;ity; and even an alder, &s;uch as tho&s;e at Bi&s;hop-Aukland, when dignified by age, makes a re&s;pectable figure.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="84">The birch may have &s;everal varieties, with which I am not acquainted. The mo&s;t com|mon &s;pecies of it in England, are the black, and the white. The former is a native of Canada: the latter of Britain. Of the white birch there is a very beautiful variety, &s;ome|times called the lady-birch, or the weeping-birch. It's &s;pray being &s;lenderer and longer, than the common &s;ort, forms an elegant, pen&s;ile foliage, like the weeping willow; and like it, is put in motion by the lea&s;t breath of air. When agitated, it is well adapted to characterize a &s;torm; or to perform any office in land&s;cape, which is expected from the weeping willow.</P>
<P>The &s;tem of the birch is generally marked with brown, yellow, and &s;ilvery touches, which are peculiarly picture&s;que; as they are characteri&s;tic objects of imitation for the pencil; and as they contra&s;t agreeably with the dark green hue of the foliage. But only the &s;tem, and larger branches have this varied colouring: the &s;pray is of a deep brown; which is the colour too of the larger branches, where the external rind is peeled off. As
<PB N="67" REF="85">
the birch grows old, it's bark becomes rough and furrowed. It lo&s;es all it's varied tints, and a&s;&s;umes a uniform, ferruginous hue.</P>
<P>The bark of this tree has the property (perhaps peculiar to it&s;elf,) of being more firm, and durable than the wood it inve&s;ts. Of this the pea&s;ants of Sweden, Lapland, and other northern countries, where birch grows in abundance, take the advantage; and &s;haping it like tiles, cover their hou&s;es with it.&mdash;How very durable it is, we have a remarkable in&s;tance in Mon&s;ieur Maupertuis's travels. When that philo&s;opher traver&s;ed Lap|land to mea&s;ure a degree of latitude, he was obliged to pa&s;s through va&s;t fore&s;ts, con&s;i&s;ting intirely of birch. The &s;oil in &s;ome parts of the&s;e wa&s;tes being very &s;hallow, or very loo&s;e, the trees had not a &s;ufficient footing for their roots, and became an ea&s;y prey to winds. In the&s;e places Maupertuis found as many trees blown down, as &s;tanding. He examined &s;everal of them, and was &s;urprized to &s;ee that in &s;uch as had lain long, the &s;ub|tance of the wood was intirely gone; but the bark remained a hollow trunk without any &s;igns of decay.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="86">Among elegant, pendent trees, the acacia &s;hould not be forgotten; tho the acacia, which we have in England, (called by the botani&s;t, the <HI>robinia</HI>) is perhaps only a poor &s;ub&s;titute of this plant in it's greate&s;t per|fection. And yet even ours, when we have it full grown, is often a very beautiful tree, whether it feathers to the ground, as it &s;ome|times does; or whether it is adorned with a light foliage hanging from the &s;tem. But it's beauty is very frail. It is of all trees the lea&s;t able to endure the bla&s;t. In &s;ome &s;heltered &s;pot, it may ornament a garden; but it is by no means, qualified to adorn a country. It's wood is of &s;o brittle a texture, e&s;pecially when it is encumbered with a weight of foliage; that you can never depend upon it's aid in filling up the part you wi&s;h. The branch you admire to-day, may be demoli&s;hed to|morrow. The misfortune is, the acacia is not one of tho&s;e grand objects, like the oak, who&s;e dignity is often increa&s;ed by ruin. It depends on it's <HI>beauty,</HI> rather than on it's <HI>grandeur,</HI> which is a quality much more liable to injury.&mdash;I may add however in it's favour, that if it be ea&s;ily injured, it repairs
<PB N="69" REF="87">
the injury more quickly, than any other tree. Few trees make &s;o rapid a growth.</P>
<P>In one of the memoirs publi&s;hed by the agricultural &s;ociety at Paris, the virtues of this tree are highly extolled. It's &s;hade en|courages the growth of gra&s;s. It's roots are &s;o tenacious of the &s;oil and &s;hoot up &s;uch groves of &s;uckers, that when planted on the banks of rivers, it contributes exceedingly to fix them as barriers again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the &s;tream. Acacia-&s;takes too are as durable as tho&s;e of any wood. In North-America this tree is much valued; in proof of which the memoriali&s;t tells a &s;tory of a farmer in Long-i&s;land, who planted an ordinary field of fourteen acres with &s;uckers of this plant, in the year of his marriage, as a portion for his children. His elde&s;t &s;on married at twenty-two. On this occa&s;ion the farmer cut about three hundred pounds worth of timber out of his acacia wood, which he gave his &s;on to buy a &s;ettlement in Lanca&s;ter county. Three years after, he did as much for a daughter. And thus he provided for his whole family; the wood in the mean time repairing by &s;uckers, all the lo&s;&s;es it received.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="88">I &s;hall conclude my account of deciduous trees with the larch, which is a kind of con|necting &s;pecies between them, and the race of ever-greens. Tho it &s;heds it's leaf with the former; it bears a cone, is re&s;inous, and ramifies like the latter. It claims the Alps, and Apennines for it's native country; where it thrives in higher regions of the air, than any tree of it's con&s;equence is known to do; hanging over rocks, and precipices, which have never been vi&s;ited by human feet. Often it is felled by the alpine pea&s;ant, and thrown athwart &s;ome yawning cha&s;m, where it affords a tremendous pa&s;&s;age from cliff to cliff; while the cataract roaring many fathoms below, is &s;een only in &s;urges of ri&s;ing vapour.</P>
<P>In ancient times the larch was employed in &s;till more arduous &s;ervice. When Hannibal laid the cliffs bare, and heaped up piles of timber to melt the rocks, (&s;o Livy tells us) the larch was his fuel: it's unctuous &s;ides &s;oon &s;pread the flame; and as the gloom of evening came on, the appendages of a nu|merous ho&s;t, elephants, and floating banners,
<PB N="71" REF="89">
and gleaming arms formed terrific images through the night; while the lofty &s;ummits of the Alps were illumined far and wide.</P>
<P>Strabo &s;peaks of alpine trees (which mo&s;t probably were larches) of a very great &s;ize. Many of them, he &s;ays, would mea&s;ure eight feet in diameter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. p. 202.</NOTE>. And at this day, ma&s;ts of &s;ingle larches mea&s;uring from one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty feet in length, have been floated from Valais, through the lake of Geneva, and down the Rhone, to Toulon; tho I have heard they are in no great e&s;teem among the contractors for the French dock-yards.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the royal &s;ociety of agriculture at Paris for the year 1787, there is an e&s;&s;ay by M. le Pre&s;ident de la Tour d'Aigues, on the culture of the larch; in which it is celebrated as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all timber-trees. He tells us, that in his own garden he has rails, which were put up in the year 1743, partly of oak, and partly of larch. The former, he &s;ays, have yielded to time: but the latter are &s;till
<PB N="72" REF="90">
&s;ound. And in his ca&s;tle of Tour d'Aigues, he has larchen beams of twenty inches &s;quare, which are &s;ound, tho above two hundred years old. The fine&s;t trees he knows of this kind, grow in &s;ome parts of Dauphiny, and in the fore&s;t of Baye in Provence, where there are larches, he tells us, which two men cannot fathom.&mdash;I have often heard, that old, dry larch will take &s;uch a poli&s;h as to become almo&s;t tran&s;parent; and that, in this &s;tate it may be wrought into very beautiful wain|&s;cot.&mdash;In my encomium of the larch, I mu&s;t not omit, that the old painters u&s;ed it, more than any other wood, to paint on, before the u&s;e of canvas became general. Many of Raphael's pictures are painted on boards of larch.</P>
<P>The larch we have in England, compared with the larch of the Alps, is a diminutive plant. It is little more than the puny in|habitant of a garden; or the embelli&s;hment of &s;ome trifling artificial &s;cene. The cha|racters of grand and noble &s;eldom belong to it. It is however an elegant tree; tho, in our &s;oil at lea&s;t, too formal in it's growth. Among it's native &s;teeps it's form, no doubt, is fully picture&s;que; when the &s;torms
<PB N="73" REF="91">
of many a century have &s;hattered it's equal &s;ides; and given contra&s;t and variety to it's boughs.</P>
<P>From deciduous trees, we proceed to ever|greens.&mdash;Of the&s;e the cedar of Lebanon claims our fir&s;t notice. To it preeminence belongs; not only on account of it's own dignity; but on account of the re&s;pectable mention, which is every where made of it in &s;cripture. Solomon &s;pake of trees <HI>from the cedar of Lebanon, to the by&s;&s;op that &s;pringeth out of the wall:</HI> that is, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t. &mdash;The ea&s;tern writers are indeed the prin|cipal &s;ources, from which we are to obtain the true character of the cedar; as it is an ea&s;tern tree. In the &s;acred writers particu|larly we are pre&s;ented with many noble images drawn from it's &s;everal qualities. It is ge|nerally employed by the prophets to expre&s;s &s;trength, power, and longevity. The &s;trength of the cedar is u&s;ed as an emblem to expre&s;s the power even of Jehovah. <HI>The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</HI> David characterizes the palm-tree, and the cedar together, both very &s;trongly. <HI>The righteous
<PB N="74" REF="92">
&s;hall flouri&s;h like a palm-tree; and &s;pread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon.</HI> The <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> head of the palm, and the <HI>&s;preading abroad</HI> of the cedar, are equally characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>But the prophet Ezekiel hath given us the fulle&s;t de&s;cription of the cedar.</P>
<P>"Behold the A&s;&s;yrian was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches; and with a &s;hadowing &s;hroud; and of an high &s;tature; and his top was among the thick boughs. His boughs were multiplied, and his branches be|came long. The fir trees were not like his boughs; nor the che&s;nut trees, like his branches, nor any tree in the garden of God like unto him in beauty."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxi.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this de&s;cription two of the principal characteri&s;tics of the cedar are marked.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the multiplicity, and length of his branches. Few trees divide &s;o many fair branches from the main &s;tem; or &s;pread over &s;o large a compa&s;s of ground. <HI>His boughs are multiplied,</HI> as Ezekiel &s;ays, and <HI>his branches became long;</HI> which David calls <HI>&s;preading abroad.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="93">The &s;econd characteri&s;tic is, what Ezekiel, with great beauty, and aptne&s;s, calls his <HI>&s;ha|dowing &s;hroud.</HI> No tree in the fore&s;t is more remarkable than the cedar, for it's clo&s;e-woven, leafy canopy.</P>
<P>Ezekiel's cedar is marked as a tree of full, and perfect growth, from the circum&s;tance of it's top, being <HI>among the thick boughs.</HI> Almo&s;t every young tree, and particularly every young cedar, has, what is called, a leading branch, or two, which continue &s;piring above the re&s;t, till the tree has at|tained it's full &s;ize: then the tree becomes in the language of the nur&s;ery-man, <HI>clump-headed;</HI> but, in the language of ea&s;tern &s;ub|limity, it's top is among <HI>the thick boughs;</HI> that is, no di&s;tinction of any &s;piry head, or leading branch, appears: the head and the branches are all mixed together. This is generally, in all trees, the &s;tate, in which they are mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t beautiful.</P>
<P>But tho Ezekiel hath given us this accurate de&s;cription of the cedar; he hath left it's &s;trength, which is it's chief characteri&s;tic, untouched. But the rea&s;on is evident. The cedar is here introduced as an emblem of A&s;&s;yria; which tho va&s;t, and wide-&s;preading,
<PB N="76" REF="94">
and come to full maturity, was in fact, on the eve of de&s;truction. <HI>Strength</HI> therefore was the la&s;t idea, which the prophet wi&s;hed to &s;ugge&s;t. Strength is a relative term, com|pared with oppo&s;ition. The A&s;&s;yrian was &s;trong compared with the powers on earth; but weak, compared with the arm of pro|vidence, which brought him to de&s;truction. So his type, the cedar, was &s;tronger than any of the trees of the fore&s;t; but weak in compari&s;on with the ax, which cut him off; and left him (as the prophet expre&s;&s;es the va&s;tne&s;s of his ruin) <HI>&s;pread upon the mountains, and in the vallies: while the nations &s;hook at the &s;ound of his fall.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the grandeur, and form of the cedar of Lebanon. It's mantling foliage, <HI>or &s;hadowing &s;hroud,</HI> as Ezekiel calls it, is it's greate&s;t beauty; which ari&s;es from the hori|zontal growth of it's branches, forming a kind of &s;weeping, irregular penthou&s;e. And when to the idea of beauty, that of &s;trength is added by the piramidal form of the &s;tem, and the robu&s;tne&s;s of the limbs, the tree is complete in all it's beauty, and maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In the&s;e climates indeed we cannot expect to &s;ee the cedar in &s;uch perfection. The
<PB N="77" REF="95">
fore&s;t of Lebanon is perhaps the only part of the world, where it's growth is perfect: yet we may in &s;ome degree conceive it's beauty and maje&s;ty, from the paltry re&s;emblances of it at this di&s;tance from it's native &s;oil. In it's <HI>youth,</HI> it is often with us a vigorous thriving plant; and if the leading branch is not bound to a pole, (as many people deform their cedars,) but left to take it's natural cour&s;e, and guide the &s;tem after it in &s;ome irregular waving line; it is often an object of great beauty. But in it's <HI>maturer age,</HI> the beauty of the Engli&s;h cedar is generally gone, it becomes &s;hrivelled, deformed, and &s;tunted; it's body increa&s;es; but it's limbs &s;hrink, and wither. Thus it never gives us it's two leading qualities together. In it's youth we have &s;ome idea of it's beauty without it's &s;trength; and in it's advanced age we have &s;ome idea of it's &s;trength, without it's beauty: the imagination therefore, by joining together the two different periods of it's age in this climate, may form &s;ome conception of the grandeur of the cedar, in it's own climate, where it's &s;trength and beauty are united. &mdash;The be&s;t &s;pecimen of this tree, I ever &s;aw in England, was at Hillington, near
<PB N="78" REF="96">
Uxbridge. The perpendicular height of it was fifty three feet; it's horizontal expan&s;e ninety &s;ix; and it's girth fifteen and a half. When I &s;aw it, in 1776, it was about one hundred and eighteen years of age; and being then completely clump-headed, it was a very noble, and picture&s;que tree.&mdash;In the high winds about the beginning of the year 1790, this noble cedar was blown down. It's &s;tem, when cut, was five feet in diameter.</P>
<P>After the cedar, the &s;tone-pine de&s;erves our notice. It is not indigenous to our &s;oil, but like the cedar, it is in &s;ome degree naturalized; tho in England it is rarely more than a puny, half-formed re&s;emblance of the Italian pine. The &s;oft clime of Italy alone gives birth to the true picture&s;que pine. There it always &s;ugge&s;ts ideas of broken por|ticos, Ionic pillars, triumphal arches, frag|ments of old temples, and a variety of cla&s;&s;ic ruins, which in Italian land&s;cape it commonly adorns.</P>
<P>The &s;tone pine promi&s;es little in it's in|fancy in point of picture&s;que beauty. It does
<PB N="79" REF="97">
not, like mo&s;t of the fir-&s;pecies, give an early indication of it's future form. In it's youth it is dwarfi&s;h, and round-headed, with a &s;hort &s;tem, and has rather the &s;hape of a full-grown bu&s;h, than of an increa&s;ing tree.&mdash;As it grows older, it does not &s;oon depo&s;it it's formal &s;hape. It is long a bu&s;h; tho &s;omewhat more irregular, and with a longer &s;tem.&mdash;But as it attains maturity, it's pic|ture&s;que form increa&s;es fa&s;t. It's lengthening &s;tem a&s;&s;umes commonly an ea&s;y &s;weep. It &s;eldom indeed deviates much from a &s;trait line: but that gentle deviation is very graceful; and above all other lines difficult to imitate. If accidentally either the &s;tem, or any of the larger branches take a larger &s;weep, than u&s;ual, that &s;weep &s;eldom fails to be graceful.&mdash;It is al&s;o among the beauties of the &s;tone-pine, that as the lateral branches decay, they leave gene|rally &s;tumps, which &s;tanding out in various parts of the &s;tem, break the continuity of it's lines.</P>
<P>The bark is &s;moother than that of any other tree of the pine-kind, except the Wey|mouth; tho we do not e&s;teem this among it's picture&s;que beauties. It's hue however, which is warm and reddi&s;h, has a good effect;
<PB N="80" REF="98">
and it obtains a kind of roughne&s;s by peeling off in patches.</P>
<P>The foliage of the &s;tone-pine is as beautiful as the &s;tem. It's colour is a deep warm green; and it's form, in&s;tead of breaking into acute angles, like many of the pine-race, is moulded into a flowing line by an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;mall ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As age comes on, it's round clump-head becomes more flat, &s;preading it&s;elf into a canopy, which is a form equally becoming. And yet I doubt, whether any re&s;inous tree ever attains that picture&s;que beauty in age, which we admire &s;o much in the oak. The oak continues long vigorous in his branches, tho his trunk decays: but the re&s;inous tree, I believe, decays more equally through all it's parts; and in age oftener pre&s;ents the idea of vegetable decrepitude, than of the &s;tout remains of a vigorous con&s;titution. And yet, in many circum&s;tances, even in this &s;tate it may be an object of picture&s;que notice.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, in the form of the &s;tone-pine, what beauty may re&s;ult from a tree with a round head, and without lateral branches; which requires indeed a good example to prove. When we look at an a&s;h, or an elm, from
<PB N="81" REF="99">
which the lateral branches have been &s;tripped, as is the practice in &s;ome countries, we are apt to think, that no tree, with a head placed on a long &s;tem, can be beautiful; yet in nature's hands, which can mould &s;o many forms of beauty, it may ea&s;ily be effected.&mdash; Nature her&s;elf however does not always follow the rules of picture&s;que beauty in the produc|tion of this kind of object. The cabbage-tree, I &s;uppo&s;e, is as ugly, as the &s;tone pine is picture&s;que.&mdash;The be&s;t &s;pecimen of the &s;tone-pine I ever &s;aw, grows in the botanical garden at Oxford.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t beautiful &s;uccedaneum of the &s;tone-pine, which the&s;e climates afford, is the pina&s;ter. The &s;weep of it's &s;tem is &s;imilar, it's broken lateral branches likewi&s;e, and it's clump-head. Both trees al&s;o are equally irregular in their growth: but the pina&s;ter is perhaps more picture&s;que in the roughne&s;s of it's dark-grey bark. On no trees have I &s;een broader, and better varied ma&s;&s;es of light, and &s;hade: but the clo&s;ene&s;s of the pina&s;ter's foliage makes it's head &s;ometimes too heavy.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="100">The clu&s;ter pine al&s;o is a beautiful tree, and approaches perhaps as near the &s;tone-pine, as the pina&s;ter does. But I &s;carce recollect ever to have &s;een it in a &s;tate of full maturity, and perfection. If we may judge however from a growth of thirty or forty years, (at which age I have often &s;een it) it &s;hoots in &s;o wild, and irregular a manner; &s;o thick, rich, and bu&s;hy, that we may ea&s;ily conceive how picture&s;que a plant it mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of full perfection. It's cones too, which it bears in clu&s;ters, from whence it derives it's name, are a great ornament to it. In com|po&s;ition indeed &s;uch minutiae are of little value: but we are now con&s;idering trees as individuals.</P>
<P>The Weymouth-pine has very little pictu|re&s;que beauty to recommend it. It is admired for it's poli&s;hed bark. The painter's eye pays little attention to &s;o trivial a cir|cum&s;tance, even when the tree is con&s;idered as a &s;ingle object. Nay it's poli&s;hed bark rather depreciates it's value: for the picture&s;que eye dwells with more plea&s;ure on rough &s;ur|faces,
<PB N="83" REF="101">
than on &s;mooth; it &s;ees more richne&s;s in them, and more variety. But we object chiefly to the Weymouth-pine on account of the regularity of it's &s;tem; and the meagrene&s;s of it's foliage. It's &s;tem ri&s;es with perpen|dicular exactne&s;s; it rarely varies: and it's branches i&s;&s;ue with equal formality from it's &s;ides. It's foliage too is thin, and wants both richne&s;s, and effect.&mdash;If I were &s;peaking indeed of this tree in compo&s;ition, I might add, that it may often appear to great advan|tage in a plantation. Contra&s;t, we know, produces beauty even from deformity it&s;elf. Oppo&s;ed therefore to the wildne&s;s of other trees, the regularity of the Weymouth-pine may have it's beauty. It's formality may be concealed. A few of it's branches hang|ing from a ma&s;s of heavier foliage, may appear light, and feathery; while it's &s;piry head may often form an agreeable apex to a clump.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the pine-race, we next take a view of a tribe nearly allied to them &mdash;that of firs. In what the di&s;tinction between the&s;e two tribes con&s;i&s;ts, (tho, I apprehend,
<PB N="84" REF="102">
it con&s;i&s;ts in little more, than in that between genus, and &s;pecies) the botani&s;t will explain. I profe&s;s my&s;elf an ob&s;erver only of outward characters. What we u&s;ually call the Scotch fir appears to me to approach nearer the pine in it's manner of growth, than it does any of it's nominal cla&s;s. As this tree therefore &s;eems to be of ambiguous nature, at lea&s;t as to it's form, I &s;hall place it here&mdash;that is imme|diately after the pines, and before the firs; that it may with facility join one party, or the other, as the reader's botanical principles incline.</P>
<P>The Scotch fir, in perfection, I think a very picture&s;que tree, tho we have little idea of it's beauty. It is generally treated with great contempt. It is a hardy plant, and therefore put to every &s;ervile office. If you wi&s;h to &s;kreen your hou&s;e from the &s;outh we&s;t wind, plant Scotch firs; and plant them clo&s;e, and thick. If you want to &s;helter a nur&s;ery of young trees, plant Scotch firs: and the phra&s;e is, you may afterwards <HI>weed them out,</HI> as you plea&s;e. This is ignominious. I wi&s;h not to rob &s;ociety of the&s;e hardy &s;er|vices from the Scotch fir: nor do I mean to &s;et it in competition with many of the
<PB N="85" REF="103">
trees of the fore&s;t, which in their infant &s;tate it is accu&s;tomed to &s;helter: all I mean is, to re&s;cue it from the di&s;grace of being thought fit for nothing el&s;e; and to e&s;tabli&s;h it's cha|racter as a picture&s;que tree. For my&s;elf, I admire it's foliage; both the colour of the leaf, and it's mode of growth. It's ramifi|cation too is irregular, and beautiful; and not unlike that of the &s;tone pine; which it re&s;embles al&s;o in the ea&s;y &s;weep of it's &s;tem; and likewi&s;e in the colour of the bark, which is commonly, as it attains age, of a rich reddi&s;h brown. The Scotch fir indeed, in it's &s;tripling &s;tate, is le&s;s an object of beauty. It's pointed, and &s;piry &s;hoots, during the fir&s;t years of it's growth, are formal: and yet I have &s;ometimes &s;een a good contra&s;t pro|duced between it's &s;piry points, and the round-headed oaks, and elms in it's neigh|bourhood. When I &s;peak however of the Scotch fir as a beautiful individual, I conceive it, when it has out-grown all the impro|prieties of it's youth&mdash;when it has compleated it's full age&mdash;and when, like Ezekiel's cedar, it has formed it's <HI>head among the thick branches.</HI> &mdash;I may be &s;ingular in my attachment to the Scotch fir: I know it has many enemies:
<PB N="86" REF="104">
but my opinion will weigh only with the rea&s;ons I have given.</P>
<P>The great contempt indeed, in which the Scotch fir is commonly held, ari&s;es, I be|lieve, from two cau&s;es.</P>
<P>People object fir&s;t to it's colour. It's dark, murky hue is unplea&s;ing.&mdash;With regard to <HI>colour in general,</HI> I think I &s;peak the lan|guage of painting, when I a&s;&s;ert, that the picture&s;que eye makes little di&s;tinction in this matter. It has no attachment to one colour in preference to another: but con&s;iders the beauty of all colouring, as re&s;ulting not from the colours them&s;elves, but almo&s;t intirely from their harmony with other colours in their neighbourhood. So that as the fir-tree is &s;upported, combined, or &s;tationed, it forms a beautiful umbrage, or a murky &s;pot.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;ource of that contempt, in which the Scotch fir is commonly held, is our rarely &s;eeing it in a picture&s;que &s;tate. Scotch firs are &s;eldom planted as <HI>&s;ingle trees,</HI> or in a <HI>jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious group:</HI> but generally in <HI>clo&s;e, com|pact bodies,</HI> in thick array, which &s;uffocates, or cramps them; and if they ever get loo&s;e from this bondage, they are already ruined. Their lateral branches are gone, and their
<PB N="87" REF="105">
&s;tems are drawn into poles, on which their heads appear &s;tuck as on a center. Whereas if the tree had grown in it's natural &s;tate, all mi&s;chief had been prevented. It's &s;tem would have taken an ea&s;y &s;weep; and it's lateral branches, which naturally grow with as much beautiful irregularity as tho&s;e of deciduous trees, would have hung loo&s;ely, and negligently; and the more &s;o, as there is &s;omething peculiarly light, and feathery in it's foliage. I mean not to a&s;&s;ert, that every Scotch fir, tho in a natural &s;tate, would po&s;|&s;e&s;s the&s;e beauties: but it would at lea&s;t, have the chance of other trees; and I have &s;een it, tho indeed but rarely, in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to equal in beauty the mo&s;t elegant &s;tone-pine.</P>
<P>All trees indeed, crouded together, naturally ri&s;e in perpendicular &s;tems: but the fir has this peculiar di&s;advantage, that it's lateral branches, once injured, never &s;hoot again. A grove of crouded &s;aplins, elms, beeches, or almo&s;t of any deciduous trees, when thinned, will throw out new lateral branches; and in time recover a &s;tate of beauty: but if the education of the fir has been neglected, he is lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="106">Some of the mo&s;t picture&s;que trees of this kind perhaps in England, adorn Mr. Lenthall's de&s;erted, and ruinous man&s;ion of Ba&s;il&s;leigh in Berk&s;hire. The &s;oil is a deep, but rich &s;and; which &s;eems to be a &s;oil adapted to them. And as they are here at perfect liberty, they not only become large, and noble trees; but they expand them&s;elves likewi&s;e in all the carele&s;s forms of nature. No man therefore has a right to depreciate the Scotch fir, till he has &s;een it here, or in &s;ome other place, in a perfect &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>The &s;pruce fir is generally e&s;teemed a more beautiful, and elegant tree, than the Scotch fir; and the rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, is, becau&s;e it often feathers to the ground, and grows in a more exact, and regular &s;hape. But this is a principal objection to it. It often wants both form and variety. We admire it's floating foliage, in which it &s;ometimes exceeds all other trees; but it is rather di&s;agreeable to &s;ee a repetition of the&s;e feathery &s;trata, beautiful as they are, reared, tier, above tier, in regular order, from the bottom of a tree to the top. It's perpendicular &s;tem,

al&s;o, which has &s;eldom any lineal variety, makes the appearance of the tree &s;till more formal.</P>
<P>It is not always however that the &s;pruce fir grows with &s;o much regularity. Some|times a lateral branch, here and there, taking the lead beyond the re&s;t, breaks &s;omewhat through the order, commonly ob&s;erved, and forms a few cha&s;ms, which have a good effect. When this is the ca&s;e, the &s;pruce fir ranks among picture&s;que trees. Sometimes it has as good an effect, and in many cir|cum&s;tances a better, when the contra&s;t appears &s;till &s;tronger&mdash;when the tree is &s;hattered by &s;ome accident; has lo&s;t many of it's branches; and is &s;cathed, and ragged. A feathery branch here and there, among broken &s;tumps, has often an admirable effect; but it mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome particular &s;ituation. In all circum&s;tances however the &s;pruce fir appears be&s;t either as a &s;ingle tree, or unmixed with any of it's fellows: for neither it, nor any of the &s;pear-headed race, will ever form a beau|tiful clump without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other trees.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="110">The &s;ilver-fir has very little to boa&s;t in point of picture&s;que beauty. It has all the regularity of the &s;pruce; but without it's floating foliage. There is a &s;ort of har&s;h, &s;tiff, unbending formality in the &s;tem, the branches, and in the whole economy of the tree, which makes it di&s;agreeable. We rarely &s;ee it, even in the happie&s;t &s;tate, a&s;&s;ume a picture&s;que &s;hape. A&s;&s;i&s;ted it may be in it's form, when broken and &s;hattered; but it will rarely get rid of it's formality. In old age it &s;tands the be&s;t chance of attaining beauty. We &s;ometimes &s;ee it under that circum&s;tance, a noble, &s;hattered tree, finely adorned with ivy, and &s;hooting out a few horizontal branches, on which it's meagre foliage, and tufted mo&s;s appear to advantage.&mdash;I may add, that the &s;ilver fir is perhaps the hardie&s;t of it's tribe. It will out-face the &s;outh-we&s;t wind: it will bear without &s;hrinking even the &s;ea-air: &s;o that one advantage at lea&s;t attends a plantation of &s;ilver firs; you may have it, where you can have no other; and a plantation of &s;ilver firs may be better than no plantation at all.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="111">I know of no other &s;pecies of fir in England, that is worth mentioning. The hemlock-&s;pruce is a beautiful loo&s;e plant, but it never, I believe, attains any &s;ize; and the Newfoundland, or black &s;pruce, is another dwarfi&s;h tree. In that character however it is often beautiful; and it's &s;mall red cones are an ornament to it.&mdash;In the va&s;t pine-fore&s;ts of North-America; and in tho&s;e, which hang beetling over the cliffs of the Baltic, the picture&s;que eye might pro|bably &s;ee many a grand production of the fir kind, which is hitherto little known: or if known, would appear there in &s;o improved a character, as to &s;eem wholly new. In the northern parts of A&s;ia al&s;o, and in the &s;outhern parts of Africa, I doubt not, but the fir may be found in great variety, and perfection. In Philip's voyage to Botany-bay we are told of pines in Norfolk-i&s;land one hundred and eighty feet high, as I recollect: but I have not the book by me. Strabo indeed tells us, that the fir is wholly a European plant&mdash;that it is never to be met with in any part of A&s;ia&mdash;and that it may even be con&s;idered, in all tho&s;e places, where Europe and A&s;ia border on each other, as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of European ground.
<PB N="92" REF="112">
On the A&s;iatic &s;ide of the Tanais, he tells us, it is never found; tho on the European &s;ide it is &s;o common that the Scythians, who inhabit tho&s;e parts, u&s;e it always in making arrows. He treats Erato&s;thenes with &s;ome contempt, for a&s;&s;erting, that when Alexander was in India, he u&s;ed fir in con&s;tructing his navy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See lib. ii. p. 510. edit. Cau&s;.</NOTE>. Strabo's accuracy is generally much re&s;pected: but, in this in&s;tance his ob&s;er|vations &s;eem to have been confined. There is little doubt, I think, that the fir abounded in many parts of A&s;ia: it was probably as much a native of mount Lebanon, as the cedar it&s;elf<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">After all however, it is probable, that the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which the Latins tran&s;late <HI>abies,</HI> and we tran&s;late <HI>fir,</HI> might appear to be &s;omewhat very different from the tree, which we call a fir, if we had a Grecian botani&s;t to con&s;ult.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the pine, and fir tribes, the yew de&s;erves our notice. The yew is a pure native of Britain, and was formerly what the oak is now, the ba&s;is of our &s;trength. Of it the old Engli&s;h yeoman made his long-bow; which, he vaunted, nobody but an Engli&s;h|man,
<PB N="93" REF="113">
could bend. In &s;hooting he did not, as in other nations, keep his left hand &s;teady, and draw his bow with his right: but keeping his right at re&s;t upon the nerve, he pre&s;&s;ed the whole weight of his body into the horns of his bow. Hence probably aro&s;e the Engli&s;h phra&s;e of <HI>bending a bow;</HI> and the French of <HI>drawing one.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the yew celebrated only for it's toughne&s;s, and ela&s;ticity; but al&s;o for it's durable nature. Where your paling is mo&s;t expo&s;ed either to winds, or &s;prings; &s;trengthen it with a po&s;t of old yew. That hardy veteran fears neither &s;torms above, nor damps below. It is a common &s;aying among&s;t the inhabitants of New-fore&s;t, that a po&s;t of yew will out|la&s;t a po&s;t of iron.</P>
<P>Thus much for the utility, and dignity of the yew. As to it's picture&s;que perfections, I profe&s;s my&s;elf (contrary I &s;uppo&s;e to general opinion) a great admirer of it's form, and foliage. The yew is of all other trees, the mo&s;t ton&s;ile. Hence all the indignities it &s;uffers. We every where &s;ee it cut and metamorpho&s;ed into &s;uch a variety of defor|mities, that we are hardly brought to conceive, it has a natural &s;hape; or the power, which
<PB N="94" REF="114">
other trees have, of hanging carele&s;sly, and negligently. Yet it has this power in a very eminent degree; and in a &s;tate of nature, except in expo&s;ed &s;ituations, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t beautiful ever-greens we have. Indeed, I know not, whether all things con|&s;idered, it is not &s;uperior to the cedar of Lebanon it&s;elf&mdash;I mean to &s;uch meagre repre|&s;entations of that noble plant, as we have in England. The &s;ame &s;oil, which cramps the cedar, is congenial to the yew.</P>
<P>It is but &s;eldom however, that we &s;ee the yew in perfection. In New-fore&s;t it formerly abounded: but it is now much &s;carcer. It does not rank among timber-trees; and being thus in a degree unprivileged, and unpro|tected by fore&s;t-laws, it has often been made booty of by tho&s;e, who dur&s;t not lay violent hands on the oak, or the a&s;h. But &s;till in many parts of the fore&s;t, &s;ome noble &s;pecimens of this tree are left. One I have often vi&s;ited, which is a tree of peculiar beauty. It imme|diately divides into &s;everal ma&s;&s;y limbs, each of which hanging in grand loo&s;e foliage, &s;preads over a large compa&s;s of ground, and yet the whole tree forms a clo&s;e, compact body: that is, it's boughs are not &s;o &s;eparated,
<PB N="95" REF="115">
as to break into di&s;tinct parts. It cannot boa&s;t the &s;ize of the yew-tree at Fotheringal, near Taymouth in Scotland, which mea&s;ures fifty-&s;ix feet, and an half in circumference; nor indeed the &s;ize of many others on record: but it has &s;ufficient &s;ize for all the purpo&s;es of land&s;cape, and in point of picture&s;que beauty it probably equals any of them. It &s;tands not far from the banks of Lymington river, on the left bank as you look towards the &s;ea, between Roydon-farm, and Boldre-church. It occupies a &s;mall knoll, &s;urrounded with other trees; &s;ome of which are yews; but of inferior beauty. A little &s;tream wa&s;hes the ba&s;e of the knoll; and winding round forms it into a penin&s;ula. If any one &s;hould have curio&s;ity to vi&s;it it from this de&s;cription, and by the help of the&s;e land-marks, I doubt not, but he may find it, at any time, within the &s;pace of the&s;e two or three centuries, in great perfection, if it &s;uffer no external injury. If &s;uch trees were common, they would recover the character of the yew-tree among the admi|rers of picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>But tho we &s;hould be able to e&s;tabli&s;h it's beauty with re&s;pect to form, and foliage; there remains one point &s;till, which we &s;hould
<PB N="96" REF="116">
find it hard to combat. It's colour unfortu|nately gives offence. It's dingy, funerial hue, people &s;ay, makes it fit only for a church|yard.</P>
<P>This objection, I hope, I have already an&s;wered in defending the colour of the Scotch fir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 86.</NOTE>. An attachment to colour, as &s;uch, &s;eems to me, an indication of fal&s;e ta&s;te. Hence ari&s;e the numerous ab&s;urdities of gaudy decoration. In the &s;ame manner, a di&s;like to any particular colour &s;hews a &s;queami&s;hne&s;s, which &s;hould as little be encouraged. Indeed, when you have only one colour to deal with, as in painting the wain&s;cot of your room, the eye properly enough gives a preference to &s;ome &s;oft, plea|&s;ant tint, in oppo&s;ition to a glaring, bold one: but when colours act in concert, (as is the ca&s;e in all &s;cenery,) red, blue, yellow, light green, or dingy green, are all alike. The virtue of each con&s;i&s;ts &s;olely in it's agreement with it's neighbours.</P>
<P>I have only to add, in commendation of this tree, that it's veins exceed in beauty tho&s;e of mo&s;t other trees. Tables made of
<PB N="97" REF="117">
yew, when the grain is fine, are much &s;u|perior to mahogany; and it's root vies in beauty with the ancient citron.</P>
<P>The ilex, or ever-green oak, pre&s;ents a character very different from that of the yew. The yew is a clo&s;e bodied, compact tree. The ilex is generally thin, and &s;traggling; tho we &s;ometimes &s;ee it, in &s;oils, which it likes, form a thicker foliage. Both the yew and the ilex are beautiful; but in different ways. As an individual, the yew is greatly &s;uperior. It is an object to admire. The beauty of the ilex ari&s;es chiefly from &s;ituation, and contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Under this head may be cla&s;&s;ed another oak, nearly an ever-green, a late production of &s;ingular origin, called the Luccam-oak, from the per&s;on, who rai&s;ed it. It was produced from an acorn of the common Turkey-oak; from which all the Luccam-oaks have been grafted; as I under&s;tand, the &s;eed of acci|dental varieties never produce the &s;ame plant. I have heard much of the beauty of this tree; and of the acqui&s;ition it will be to winter-&s;cenery by the introduction of a new,
<PB N="98" REF="118">
and beautiful ever-green. It may be &s;o. It's growth, I am told, is rapid. But from the few plants I have &s;een of this &s;tock, and tho&s;e but young, no judgment can well be formed.</P>
<P>The holly can hardly be called a tree, tho it is a large &s;hrub. It is a plant however of &s;ingular beauty. Mr. Evelin, in his Sylva, cries out with rapture; "Is there under heaven a more glorious, and refre&s;hing ob|ject of the kind, than an impenetrable hedge, of about four hundred feet in length, nine feet high, and five in diameter, which I can &s;hew in my gardens at Say's-court, at any time of the year, glittering with it's armed and varni&s;hed leaves; the taller &s;tandards at orderly di&s;tances, blu&s;hing with their natural coral&mdash;&s;horn and fa&s;hioned into columns, and pila&s;ters, architectionally &s;haped, at due di&s;|tance."</P>
<P>Tho we cannot accord with the learned naturali&s;t in the whole of this rapturous en|comium on the hedge at Say's-court; yet in part we agree with him; and admire, as much as he does, the holly, <HI>glittering
<PB N="99" REF="119">
with it's armed and varni&s;hed leaves; and blu&s;hing with it's natural coral.</HI> But we could wi&s;h to recommend it, not in a hedge, but in a fore&s;t; where, mixed with oak, or a&s;h, or other trees of the wood, it contributes to form the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes; blending it&s;elf with the trunks, and &s;keletons of the winter; or with the varied greens of &s;ummer. &mdash;But in it's combined &s;tate we &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to mention it. At pre&s;ent we &s;hall only ob&s;erve that, as far as an in|dividual bu&s;h can be beautiful, the holly is extremely &s;o. It has be&s;ides to recommend it, that it is among the hardie&s;t and &s;toute&s;t plants of Engli&s;h growth. It thrives in all &s;oils, and in all &s;ituations. At Dungene&s;s in Kent, I have heard, it flouri&s;hes even among the pebbles of the beach.</P>
<P>The haw-thorn &s;hould not entirely be pa&s;&s;ed over amid&s;t the minuter plants of the fore&s;t, tho it has little claim to picture&s;que beauty. In &s;ong indeed the &s;hepherd may with propriety
<Q><L>&mdash;tell his tale</L>
<L>Under the haw-thorn in the dale:</L></Q>
<PB N="100" REF="120">
But when the &s;cenes of nature are pre&s;ented to the eye, it is but a poor appendage.&mdash; It's &s;hape is bad. It does not taper, and point, like the holly, but is rather a matted, round, heavy bu&s;h. It's fragrance indeed is great: but it's bloom, which is the &s;ource of that fragrance, is &s;pread over it in too much profu&s;ion. It becomes a mere white &s;heet&mdash; a bright &s;pot, which is &s;eldom found in har|mony with the objects around it. In autumn the haw-thorn makes it's be&s;t appearance. It's glowing berries produce a rich tint, which often adds great beauty to the corner of a wood, or the &s;ide of &s;ome crouded clump.</P>

<P>WE have thus endeavoured to mark the <HI>principal characteri&s;tics</HI> of picture&s;que beauty, in the mo&s;t common trees we have in England. But to have a more accurate idea of their <HI>nice peculiarities, and di&s;tinctions,</HI> we &s;hould examine their &s;maller parts with a little more preci&s;ion&mdash;their ramification in winter; as well as the ma&s;s of foliage, which they exhibit in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Their ramification, in part, we have already con&s;idered; but it has only been that of the larger boughs, which &s;upport the foliage; and &s;uch as we commonly &s;ee under the ma&s;&s;es of it, when in full leaf. Winter di&s;|covers the nicer parts of the ramification&mdash; the little tender &s;pray; on which the hang|ing of the foliage, and the peculiar character of the tree &s;o much depend.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="122">The &s;tudy is certainly u&s;eful. It is true it has none of the larger parts of painting for it's object&mdash;compo&s;ition&mdash;or the ma&s;&s;ing of light and &s;hade: but we con&s;ider the &s;pray as a kind of &s;ylvan anatomy; which is very nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e to under&s;tand, who wi&s;h either to be acquainted with the par|ticular character of each tree; or to repre|&s;ent it's <HI>general effect</HI> with any degree of ex|actne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor is it an unplea&s;ing &s;tudy. There is much variety in the ramification of each &s;pecies; and much al&s;o in that of each indi|vidual. We &s;ee every where &s;o many elegant lines; &s;o much oppo&s;ition, and rich in|ter&s;ection among them, that there are few more beautiful objects in nature, than the ramification of a tree. For my&s;elf, I am in doubt, whether an old, rough, interwoven oak, merely as a <HI>&s;ingle object,</HI> has not as much beauty in winter, as in &s;ummer. In &s;ummer it has unque&s;tionably more effect; but in point of &s;imple beauty, and amu&s;e|ment, I think I &s;hould almo&s;t prefer it in winter.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="123">If a man were di&s;po&s;ed to moralize, the ramification of a thriving tree affords a good theme. Nothing gives a happier idea of bu&s;y life.

<P>As I &s;at carele&s;sly at my window, and threw my eyes upon a large acacia, which grew before me, I conceived it might aptly repre&s;ent a country divided into provinces, towns, and families. The larger branches might hold out the fir&s;t&mdash;the &s;maller branches, connected with them, the &s;econd&mdash;and tho&s;e com|binations of collateral leaves, which &s;pecify the acacia, might repre&s;ent families, compo&s;ed of individuals.&mdash;It was now late in the year; and the autumnal tint had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great part of the tree.</P>
<P>As I &s;at looking at it, many of the yellow leaves (which having been produced earlier, decayed &s;ooner) were continually dropping into the lap of their great mother. Here was an emblem of natural decay&mdash;the mo&s;t obvious appearance of mortality.</P>
<P>As I continued looking, a gentle breeze ru&s;led among the leaves. Many fell, which in a natural cour&s;e might have enjoyed life longer. Here malady was added to decay.</P>
<P>The bla&s;t increa&s;ed, and every branch, that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, bowed before it. A &s;hower of leaves covered the ground. The cup of vengeance, &s;aid I, is poured out upon the people. Pe&s;tilence &s;hakes the land. Nature &s;ickens in the gale. They fall by multitudes. Whole families are cut off together.</P>
<P>Among the branches was one intirely withered. The leaves were &s;hrivelled; yet clinging to it.&mdash;Here was an emblem of famine. The nutriment of life was &s;topped. Exi&s;tence was ju&s;t &s;upported: but every form was emaciated, and &s;hrunk.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood &s;tretched a branch, not only &s;hrivelled, and withered; but having been more expo&s;ed to winds, was &s;tripped almo&s;t intirely of it's leaves. Here and there hung a &s;olitary leaf, ju&s;t enough to &s;hew, that the whole had lately been alive. Ah! &s;aid I, here is an emblem of depopulation. Some violent cau&s;e hath laid wa&s;te the land. Towns, and villages, as well as families are de&s;olated. Scarce ten are left to bemoan a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>How does every thing around us bring it's le&s;&s;on to our minds! Nature is the great book of God. In every page is in&s;truction to tho&s;e, who read. Mortality mu&s;t claim it's due. Death in various &s;hapes hovers round us.&mdash;Thus far went the heathen morali&s;t.

The examination of the&s;e few principal trees will &s;hew how con&s;equential a part, the &s;pray is, in fixing the <HI>character</HI> of the tree.

<P><PB N="106" REF="126">In the &s;pray of the four &s;pecies of trees ju&s;t mentioned, and I doubt not, in that of all other trees, nature &s;eems to ob&s;erve one &s;imple principle; which is, that the mode of growth in the &s;pray, corre&s;ponds exactly with that of the larger branches, of which indeed the &s;pray is the origin. Thus the oak divides his boughs from the &s;tem more hori|zontally, than mo&s;t other deciduous trees. The &s;pray makes exactly in miniature the &s;ame appearance. It breaks out in right an|gles, or in angles that are nearly &s;o; forming it's &s;hoots commonly in &s;hort lines; the &s;econd year's &s;hoot u&s;ually taking &s;ome direc|tion contrary to that of the fir&s;t.

more of the picture&s;que roughne&s;s, than we ob&s;erve in the &s;pray of any other tree. The &s;pray of the oak generally &s;prings from the upper, or the lateral parts of the bough: and it is this, which gives it's branches that horizontal appearance, which they generally a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>The &s;pray of the a&s;h is very different. As the boughs of the a&s;h are le&s;s complex, &s;o is it's &s;pray. In&s;tead of the thick, intermingled bu&s;hine&s;s, which the &s;pray of the oak exhibits; that of the a&s;h is much more &s;imple, running in a kind of irregular parallels. The main &s;tem holds it's cour&s;e, forming at the &s;ame time a beautiful &s;weep: but the &s;pray does not divide like that of the oak, from the extremity of the la&s;t year's &s;hoot; but &s;prings from the &s;ides of it. Two &s;hoots &s;pring out, oppo&s;ite to each other; and each pair in a con|trary direction. Rarely however both the &s;hoots of either &s;ide come to maturity; one of them is commonly lo&s;t, as the tree increa&s;es; or at lea&s;t makes no appearance in compari&s;on with the other, which takes the lead.

of growth, (&s;o injurious to the beauty of the &s;pruce fir, and &s;ome other trees,) the a&s;h never contracts the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting formality from it. It may even receive great pictu|re&s;que beauty: for &s;ometimes the whole branch is lo&s;t, as far as one of the lateral &s;hoots, and this occa&s;ions a kind of rectangular junction, which forms a beautiful contra&s;t with the other &s;pray, and gives an elegant mode of hanging to the tree.</P>
<P>This points out another difference between the &s;pray of the oak, and that of the a&s;h. The &s;pray of the oak, we ob&s;erved, &s;eldom &s;hoots from the under&s;ides of the larger branches: and it is this, together with the &s;trength and firmne&s;s of the branches which keeps them in a horizontal form. But the &s;pray of the a&s;h, as often breaks out on the under&s;ide of the branch, as on the upper; and being of a texture weaker, than that of the oak, it generally, as the bough increa&s;es, depends below the larger branch; and ri&s;ing again forms, in full grown trees e&s;pecially, very elegant pendent boughs.</P>
<P>The branch of the elm hath neither the &s;trength, nor the various abrupt twi&s;tings of

the oak; nor doth it &s;hoot &s;o much in hori|zontal directions. Such al&s;o is the &s;pray. It has a more regular appearance; not &s;tarting off at right angles; but forming it's &s;hoots more acutely with the parent branch.</P>
<P>Neither does the &s;pray of the elm &s;hoot, like that of the a&s;h, in regular pairs, from the &s;ame knot; but in a kind of alternacy. It has generally, at fir&s;t, a flat appearance: but as one year's &s;hoot is added to another, it has not &s;trength to &s;upport it&s;elf; and as the tree grows old, it often becomes pendent al&s;o, like the a&s;h: whereas the toughne&s;s, and &s;trength of the oak enables it to &s;tretch out it's branches horizontally to the very la&s;t twig.</P>
<P>The &s;pray of the beech ob&s;erves the &s;ame kind of alternacy, as that of the elm: but it &s;hoots in angles &s;till more acute&mdash;the di&s;tance between each twig is wider; and it forms a kind of zigzag in it's cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We e&s;teem the beech al&s;o, in &s;ome degree, a pendent tree, as well as the a&s;h: but there is a wide difference between them. The a&s;h is a light airy tree, and it's &s;pray hangs in
<PB N="110" REF="133">
elegant, loo&s;e foliage. But the hanging &s;pray of the beech, in old trees e&s;pecially, is often twi&s;ted, and intermingled di&s;agreeably; and has a perplexed, matted appearance. The whole tree gives us &s;omething of the idea of an intangled head of bu&s;hy hair, from which, here and there, hangs a di&s;orderly lock; while the &s;pray of the a&s;h, like hair neither neglected, nor finically nice, has no|thing &s;qualid in it, and yet hangs in loo&s;e and ea&s;y curls.</P>
<P>The &s;pray of trees puts on different ap|pearances, as the &s;pring advances. When their buds begin to &s;well, mo&s;t of them pu&s;h out a bloom, which over&s;preads them with great richne&s;s. But of all others, the a&s;h pre&s;ents the mo&s;t &s;ingular, and beautiful a&s;|pect. About the end of march, or the be|ginning of april, it throws out a knotty bloom, which opening gradually, not only inriches the &s;pray; but is in it&s;elf one of the mo&s;t beautiful among the minuter appearances of nature. The feminal &s;tems are of an olive tint, and each of them tipped with a black &s;eed.&mdash;Often too the &s;pray of the a&s;h, is
<PB N="111" REF="134">
inriched by the ragged remnants of the keys, and tongues of the la&s;t year; which mixed with the bloom, has a good effect.</P>
<P>The elm too throws out a beautiful bloom, in form of a &s;picated ball, about the higne&s;s of a nutmeg, of a dark crim&s;on colour. This bloom &s;ometimes blows in &s;uch profu&s;ion, as to thicken and inrich the &s;pray exceedingly; even to the fullne&s;s almo&s;t of foliage. It is not however often &s;een in &s;uch perfection. In the &s;pring of the year 1776, it was more than commonly profu&s;e. Indeed the bloom of fore&s;t-trees in general is rarely annual: it appears in profu&s;ion only every &s;econd, or third year; and even then, &s;eldom all the trees of the &s;ame kind bloom at once. Thus, when you look into a grove of oaks, about the beginning of may, you will &s;uppo&s;e per|haps, that &s;ome are much forwarder in leaf than others; whereas in fact this appearance chiefly ari&s;es from their being in bloom; their little pen&s;ile catkins hanging in knots, adorned with tufts of young leaves.</P>
<P>Having thus made a few ob&s;ervations on the forms of trees, their different modes of
<PB N="112" REF="135">
growth, and other peculiarities; I &s;hould add, that I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing, nature to act always in <HI>exact</HI> conformity to the appear|ances, which I have here marked. In the <HI>general mode of growth,</HI> which each &s;pecies ob&s;erves, no doubt, &s;he is uniform: but in the <HI>particular manner,</HI> in which the &s;tem ri&s;es, the branches &s;hoot, the foliage hangs, and indeed, if I may &s;o &s;peak, in the &s;pecific character of each individual, many circum|&s;tances will make a difference; &s;oils and climate e&s;pecially. The&s;e have the &s;ame effect on the form of trees, which they have on the form of animals. We not only &s;ee di&s;tant parts of the earth, but even contiguous countries exhibit varieties in the &s;ame &s;pecies of animals: the Engli&s;h and Scotch hor&s;e are very different creatures: and as climates and &s;oils are &s;till more connected with trees, than with animals, we may ob&s;erve a greater difference produced in them, within a &s;maller di&s;tance. The oak of one country differs in form from the oak of another. In one, it carries commonly an erect &s;tem for many yards from the ground: in another, it's branches begin very quickly to divide, and &s;traggle. In the former &s;ituation the foliage
<PB N="113" REF="136">
may be thick, and interwoven; in the latter, it may be thin, and meagre: but in both &s;ituations you may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h it from the oak, or the beech. The ob&s;ervations therefore, which we have made on the form of trees, cannot in many minute circum|&s;tances be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uit the <HI>individuals</HI> of every country; tho I have endeavoured, as well as I could, to adapt them to the <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> They were chiefly made on the trees of New-fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire; the &s;oil of which, in general, is a hungry gravel, or a cold clay.</P>

<P>But fir&s;t, it cannot be enough lamented by the lovers of land&s;cape, that we meet with &s;o few of the&s;e noble characters. Trees indeed, &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of <HI>di&s;|tant &s;cenery,</HI> we often find; but a tree in full perfection, as a grand object to grace
<PB N="116" REF="138">
a <HI>foreground,</HI> is rarely &s;een. Wherever trees can be turned to profit, they are commonly cut down, long before they attain picture&s;que perfection.

<P>Some of the noble&s;t oaks in England were at lea&s;t formerly found in Su&s;&s;ex. They re|quired &s;ometimes a &s;core of oxen to draw them; and were carried in a &s;ort of wain, which in that deep country, is expre&s;&s;ively called a <HI>tugg.</HI> Two or three years was not an uncommon &s;pace of time for a tree to &s;pend in performing it's journey to Chatham. One tugg carried the load but a little way, and left it for another tugg to take up. If the rains &s;et in, it &s;tirred no more that year; and &s;ometimes no part of the next &s;ummer was dry enough for the tugg to proceed. So that the timber was generally

<P>As it is thus a general complaint that noble trees are rarely to be found, we mu&s;t &s;eek them where we can; and con&s;ider them when found, as matters of curio&s;ity; and pay them a due re&s;pect.</P>

It's dimen&s;ions are not handed down to us; but from the following circum&s;tances, we may &s;uppo&s;e them to have been very ample. When Xerxes &s;et out on his Grecian expedi|tion, his rout led him near this noble tree. Xerxes, it &s;eems, was a great admirer of trees. Amid&s;t all his deva&s;tations in an enemy's coun|try, it was his particular order to &s;pare the groves. This wonderful plane therefore &s;truck his fancy. He had &s;een nothing like it before; and to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all his officers, ordered his mighty ho&s;t to halt three days; during which time he could not be drawn from the Phrygian plane. His pavilion was &s;pread under it; and he enjoyed the luxury of it's delicious &s;hade; while the Greeks were taking mea&s;ures to &s;eize the pa&s;s at Thermopyle.&mdash; The &s;tory may not &s;peak much in favour of the

<P>In Arcadia, at the foot of the mountains, bounding the Stymphalian plains (famous for one of the labours of Hercules) &s;tood the little town of Caphiae; and ju&s;t above it ro&s;e a fountain, called the Menalaid fountain; by the &s;ide of which Pau&s;anias tells us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;. Arcad. c. 23.</NOTE>, grew a plane-tree of extraordinary &s;ize and beauty, called the Menalaid-plane. It was generally believed in the country, he tells us, that Menelaus coming to Caphiae to rai&s;e forces for the Trojan war, planted this tree with his own hands. Pau&s;anias travelled through Greece in the reign of Antoninus Pius, who &s;ucceeded to the empire, A. D. 151. So that the age of the tree, when Pau&s;anias &s;aw it, mu&s;t have been about one thou&s;and, three hundred years.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next exhibit another plane-tree of great celebrity, which flouri&s;hed in Lycia,
<PB N="124" REF="146">
during the reigns of the Roman Cae&s;ars. From a va&s;t &s;tem it divided into &s;everal huge boughs; every one of which had the con&s;e|quence of a large tree; and at a di&s;tance the whole together exhibited the appearance of a grove. It's branches &s;till flouri&s;hed, while it's trunk decayed. This in proce&s;s of time moul|dered away into an immen&s;e cave, at lea&s;t eighty feet in circumference; around the &s;ides of which were placed &s;eats of pumice &s;tone; cu&s;hioned &s;oftly with mo&s;s. This tree was fir&s;t brought into repute by Licinius Mutianus, governor of Lycia. Licinius was a curious man; and not unver&s;ed in natural hi&s;tory. Pliny, from whom we have the account of the tree, has thought proper to quote him fre|quently; mentioning particularly his remarks on Egyptian paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. xiii. c. 13.</NOTE>; and al&s;o on that kind of wood, of which the &s;tatue of Diana at Ephe&s;us was made<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. xvi. c. 40.</NOTE>. With the Lycian-plane Licinius was exceedingly plea&s;ed; and often enjoyed the company of his friends under it's &s;hade. It was great luxury, he would &s;ay, to dine in it's trunk on a &s;ultry &s;ummer-day; and to hear a heavy &s;hower of rain de&s;cending

through the &s;everal &s;tages of it's leaves. As a naturali&s;t, he left it on record, that him&s;elf and eighteen other per&s;ons, dined commodi|ou&s;ly around the benches in the body of it.</P>
<P>Caligula had a tree of the &s;ame kind at his villa near Velitrae. But Caligula's tree appears to have been more complex, than the Lycian plane.

<P>From the &s;ame author we have an account of four holm trees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. xvi. c. 44.</NOTE>, &s;till exi&s;ting in his time, which were of great antiquity. Three of them, he &s;ays, &s;tood upon the &s;ite of the ancient Tybur, which was a city older
<PB N="126" REF="148">
than Rome; and the&s;e trees were not only older than Tybur; but were trees of con|&s;equence in the days of Tiburtus, who founded it. For tradition a&s;&s;ures us, &s;ays Pliny, they were the very trees, on which that hero ob|&s;erved an ominous flight of birds, and was determined by them in the &s;ite of his town. As Tiburtus was the &s;on of Amphiareus, who died at Thebes a hundred years before the Trojan war; the&s;e trees, at the lowe&s;t cal|culation, mu&s;t have been fourteen or fifteen hundred years old, in the time of Pliny. Tho this is far from being incredible, yet as it re&s;ts wholly on tradition, we pay it the le&s;s attention. What Pliny &s;ays in the favour of the fourth tree however has more weight. This tree, he tells us, grew in the Vatican; and had it's age in&s;cribed in old Tu&s;can cha|racters, upon it's trunk; from which in&s;crip|tion it appeared, that before the city of Rome had it's exi&s;tence, this holm was a celebrated tree.</P>

yards in the &s;pread of it's boughs. At about five or &s;ix yards from the ground, it divided into five limbs; each of which was a ma&s;&s;y tree."</P>
<P>A later traveller, Van Egmont, who vi&s;ited the &s;cenes of mount Lebanon, &s;eems al&s;o to &s;peak of the &s;ame trees, which Maundrel mentions. He ob&s;erved them, he &s;ays, to be of very different ages. The old &s;tandards had low &s;tems; growing like fruit trees. Whereas the younger made a much more &s;tately appearance, not a little re&s;embling pines. Of the ancient trees he &s;aw only eleven: tho&s;e of younger growth far exceeded that number. Some of the&s;e old cedars were four, or five fathoms in circumference. Un|der one of them was erected an altar; where the clergy of Tripoly, and the neighbouring convent of Ma&s;&s;urki &s;ometimes celebrated ma&s;s. From this tree &s;pread five limbs, re&s;embling &s;ub&s;tantial trees, each being about an hundred feet in length; and in&s;erted into the main trunk about fourteen, or fifteen feet from the ground.</P>
<P>The&s;e are noble dimen&s;ions, tho it is pro|bable, that the be&s;t of the trees now left upon mount Lebanon, are only the refu&s;e of
<PB N="130" REF="152">
the ancient race; as we may well &s;uppo&s;e, the be&s;t were occa&s;ionally taken fir&s;t. If Solomon's botanical works had &s;till been pre&s;erved, it is probable we &s;hould have met with trees of much larger dimen&s;ions, than the&s;e, which Maundrel, and Van Egmont mea&s;ured.</P>
<P>One of the noble&s;t trees on record, is a che&s;nut upon mount Aetna, called the <HI>Ca&s;|tagna de cento cavalli.</HI> It is &s;till alive, but has lo&s;t much of it's original dignity. Many travellers take notice of it. Brydone was the la&s;t who &s;aw it. His account is dated about &s;ixteen, or &s;eventeen, years ago. It had then the appearance of five di&s;tinct trees. The &s;pace within them, he was a&s;&s;ured, had once been filled with &s;olid timber, when the whole formed only one tree. The po&s;&s;ibility of this he could not at fir&s;t conceive; for the five trees together contained a &s;pace of two hundred and four feet in diameter. At length however he was convinced, not only by the te&s;timony of the country, and the accurate examination of the canon Recupero, a learned naturali&s;t in tho&s;e parts, but by the appear|ance
<PB N="131" REF="153">
of the trees them&s;elves, none of which had any bark on the in&s;ide. This che&s;nut is of &s;uch renown, that Brydone tells us, he had &s;een it marked in an old map of Sicily, publi&s;hed a hundred years ago<NOTE PLACE="foot">See Brydone's trav. vol. i. p. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among other authors, who mention this tree, Kircher gives us the following account of it's condition in his day; which might be about a century before Brydone &s;aw it: "O&s;tendit mihi viae dux, unius ca&s;taniae corticem, tantae magnitudinis, ut intra eam integer pecorum grex, a pa&s;toribus tanquam in caula commodi&s;&s;ima, noctu intercluderetur." From this account, one &s;hould imagine, that in Kircher's days the five trees were <HI>more united,</HI> than when Brydone &s;aw them.</P>
<P>At New&s;tadt, in the duchy of Wirtemberg, &s;tood a lime, which was for many ages &s;o remarkable, that the city frequently took it's denomination from it, being often called <HI>New&s;tadt ander gra&s;&s;en linden,</HI> or New&s;tadt near the great lime. Scarce any per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="132" REF="154">
near New&s;tadt, without vi&s;iting this tree; and many princes and great men did honour to it, by building obeli&s;ks, columns, and monu|ments of various kinds around it, engraved with their arms, and names, to which the dates were added, and often &s;ome device. Mr. Evelin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ev. Sylva, page 225.</NOTE>, who procured copies of &s;e|veral of the&s;e monumental in&s;criptions, tells us, there were near two hundred of them. The columns on which they were fixed, &s;erved al&s;o to bear up the va&s;t limbs of the tree, which began through age to become unweildy. Thus this mighty plant &s;tood many years in great &s;tate, the ornament of the town, the admiration of the country, and &s;upported, as it were, by the princes of the empire. At length it felt the effects of war. New&s;tadt was &s;urrounded by an enemy, and the limbs of this venerable tree were mangled in wantonne&s;s by the be&s;ieging troops. Whether it &s;till exi&s;t, I know not: but long after the&s;e injuries, it &s;tood a noble ruin, di&s;covering by the foundations of the &s;everal monuments, which formerly propped it's
<PB N="133" REF="155">
&s;preading boughs, how far it's limits had once extended.</P>
<P>As a parallel to the lime of New&s;tadt, I &s;hall next celebrate the lime of Cleves. This al&s;o was a tree of great magnificence. It grew in an open plain, ju&s;t at the entrance of the city, and was thought an object worthy to exerci&s;e the ta&s;te of magi&s;tracy. The burgo|ma&s;ter of his day had it &s;urveyed with great accuracy, and trimmed into eight, broad, pyramidal faces. Each corner was &s;upported by a hand&s;ome &s;tone pillar; and in the middle of the tree was cut a noble room; which the va&s;t &s;pace contained within, ea&s;ily &s;uffered, without injuring the regularity of any of the eight faces. To crown all, the top was curi|ou&s;ly clipped into &s;ome kind of head, and adorned artificially; but in what manner, whe|ther with the head of a lion, or a &s;tag, a weather cock, or a &s;un-dial, we are not told. It was &s;omething however in the highe&s;t &s;tile of Dutch ta&s;te.&mdash;This tree was long the admiration, and envy of all the &s;tates of Hol|land; and Mr. Evelin, from whom we have the relation, &s;eems to have thought it a piece
<PB N="134" REF="156">
of excellent workman&s;hip: "I needed not, &s;ays he, have charged this paragraph with half the&s;e trees, but to &s;hew how much more the lime-tree &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to be wrought into the&s;e arborious wonders, than other trees of &s;lower growth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sylva, p. 225.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The oaks of Chaucer are celebrated, in the annals of poetry, as the trees, under which
<Q><L>&mdash;the laughing &s;age</L>
<L>Carolled his moral &s;ong&mdash;</L></Q>
They grew in the park at Donnington-ca&s;tle, near Newbery, where Chaucer &s;pent his latter life in &s;tudious retirement.&mdash;The large&s;t of the&s;e trees was called the <HI>king's-oak,</HI> and carried an erect &s;tem of fifty feet, before it broke into branches, and was cut into a beam, five feet &s;quare.&mdash;The next in &s;ize was called the <HI>queen's-oak,</HI> and &s;urvived the calamities of the civil wars in king Charles's time; tho Donnington-ca&s;tle, and the country around it, were &s;o often the &s;cenes of action, and de&s;ola|tion. It's branches were very curious: they
<PB N="135" REF="157">
pu&s;hed out from the &s;tem in &s;everal uncommon directions; imitating the horns of a ram, rather than the branches of an oak. When it was felled, it yielded a beam forty feet long, without knot, or blemi&s;h, perfectly &s;trait, four feet &s;quare at the but-end, and near a yard at the top.&mdash;The third of the&s;e oaks was called <HI>Chaucer's,</HI> of which we have no parti|culars: in general, only we are told, that it was a noble tree, tho inferior to either of the others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Evelin's Sylva, p. 227.</NOTE>. None of them, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e from this account, was a tree of picture&s;que beauty. A &s;trait &s;tem, of forty or fifty feet, let it's head be what it will, can hardly pro|duce a picture&s;que form. When we admired the &s;tone-pine, we &s;uppo&s;ed it's &s;tem to take a &s;weeping line; and to be broken al&s;o with &s;tumps, or decayed branches.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e by the gate of the water-walk, at Magdalen college in Oxford, grew an oak, which perhaps &s;tood there a &s;aplin, when Alfred the great founded the univer&s;ity. This period only includes a &s;pace of nine hundred
<PB N="136" REF="158">
years, which is no great age for an oak. It is a difficult matter indeed to a&s;certain the age of a tree. The age of a ca&s;tle, or abbey is the object of hi&s;tory. Even a common hou&s;e is recorded by the family, that built it. All the&s;e objects arrive at maturity in their youth, if I may &s;o &s;peak. But the tree gradually compleating it's growth, is not worth record|ing in the early part of it's exi&s;tence. It is then only a common tree; and afterwards when it becomes remarkable for it's age, all memory of it's youth is lo&s;t. This tree how|ever can almo&s;t produce hi&s;torical evidence for the age a&s;&s;igned to it. About five hundred years after the time of Alfred, William of Wainfleet, Dr. Stukely tells us, expre&s;sly ordered his college to be founded near the <HI>great oak</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Itiner. curios.</NOTE>: and an oak could not, I think, be le&s;s than five hundred years of age, to merit that title; together with the honour of fixing the &s;ite of a college. When the magnificence of cardinal Wol&s;ey erected that hand&s;ome tower, which is &s;o ornamental to the whole building, this tree might probably be in the meridian
<PB N="137" REF="159">
of it's glory; or rather perhaps it had attained a green old age. But it mu&s;t have been mani|fe&s;tly in it's decline, at that memorable aera, when the tyranny of James gave the fellows of Magdalen &s;o noble an opportunity of with|&s;tanding bigotry, and &s;uper&s;tition. It was afterwards much injured in Charles II's time, when the pre&s;ent walks were laid out. It's roots were di&s;turbed; and from that period it declined fa&s;t; and became reduced by degrees to little more than a mere trunk. The olde&s;t members of the univer&s;ity can &s;carce recollect it in better plight. But the faithful records of hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. plot's hi&s;t. of Oxf. ch. vi. &s;ect. 45.</NOTE> have handed down it's ancient dimen|&s;ions. Through a &s;pace of &s;ixteen yards, on every &s;ide from it's trunk, it once flung it's boughs; and under it's magnificent pavilion could have &s;heltered with ea&s;e three thou&s;and men; tho in it's decayed &s;tate, it could, for many years do little more than &s;helter &s;ome luckle&s;s individual, whom the driving &s;hower had overtaken in his evening walk. In the &s;ummer of the year 1788, this magnificent ruin fell to the ground; alarming the college
<PB N="138" REF="160">
with it's ru&s;hing &s;ound. It then appeared how precariou&s;ly it had &s;tood for many years. It's grand tap-root was decayed; and it had hold of the earth only by two or three roots, of which none was more than a couple of inches in diameter. From a part of it's ruins a chair has been made for the pre&s;ident of the college, which will long continue it's memory.</P>
<P>Near Work&s;op grew an oak, which in re&s;pect both to it's own dignity, and the dignity of it's &s;ituation, de&s;erves honourable mention. In point of grandeur few trees equalled it. It over&s;pread a &s;pace of ninety feet from the extremities of it's oppo&s;ite boughs. The&s;e dimen&s;ions will produce an area capable, on mathematical calculation, of covering a &s;quadron of two hundred and thirty-five hor&s;e. &mdash;The dignity of it's &s;tation was equal to the dignity of the tree it&s;elf. It &s;tood on a point, where York&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, and Derby&s;hire unite, and &s;pread it's &s;hade over a portion of each. From the honourable &s;tation of thus fixing the boundaries of three large counties, it was equally re&s;pected through the domains of them all; and was known far and
<PB N="139" REF="161">
wide, by the honourable di&s;tinction of the <HI>&s;hire-oak,</HI> by which appellation it was marked among cities, towns, and rivers, in all the larger maps of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Evelin's &s;ylva, p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the garden at Tortworth, in Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire, an old family-&s;eat, belonging to lord Ducie, grows a Spani&s;h che&s;nut of great age, and dimen&s;ions. Traditional accounts &s;uppo&s;e it to have been a boundary-tree in the time of king John; and I have met with other accounts, which place it in the &s;ame honour|able &s;tation in the reign of king Stephen. How much older it may be, we know not. Con&s;iderably older it probably was: for we rarely make boundary-trees of &s;aplins, and off-&s;ets; which are liable to a thou&s;and ac|cidents, and are unable to maintain, with proper dignity, the &s;tation delegated to them. &mdash;This tree is at pre&s;ent in hands, which ju&s;tly value, and protect it's age. It was barely included within the garden-wall, which bore hard upon it. Lord Ducie removed the incumbrance; and at the &s;ame time applied
<PB N="140" REF="162">
fre&s;h earth to the roots of the tree, which &s;eems to have inlivened it. So late as in the year 1788 it produced great quantities of che&s;nuts; which tho &s;mall, were &s;weet, and well-flavoured.&mdash; In the great che&s;nut-cau&s;e, mentioned a little above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 60.</NOTE>, between Barrington, and Ducarel, this venerable tree was called upon as an evidence; and gave a very re&s;pectable te&s;timony in favour of the che&s;nuts.</P>
<P>After mentioning this che&s;nut, which has been celebrated &s;o much, I cannot forbear mentioning another, which is equally remark|able for having never been celebrated at all; tho it is one of the large&s;t trees, that per|haps ever exi&s;ted in England. If it had ever been noticed merely for it's bulk, I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it over among other gigantic plants, that had nothing el&s;e to boa&s;t; but as no hi&s;torian, or antiquarian, &s;o far as I have heard, hath taken the lea&s;t notice of it, I thought it right from this very circum&s;tance to make up the omi&s;&s;ion by giving it at lea&s;t, what little credit the&s;e papers could give.&mdash;
<PB N="141" REF="163">
This che&s;nut grows at a place called Wimley, near Hitchin-priory in Hertford&s;hire. In the year 1789, at five feet above the ground, it's girth was &s;omewhat more than fourteen yards. It's trunk was hollow, and in part open. But it's vegetation was &s;till vigorous. On one &s;ide it's va&s;t arms, &s;hooting up in various forms, &s;ome upright, and others oblique, were decayed, and peeled at the extremities; but i&s;&s;ued from luxuriant foliage at their in&s;ertion in the trunk. On the other &s;ide, the foliage was &s;till full, and hid all decay.</P>
<P>In a glade of Hainhault-fore&s;t in E&s;&s;ex, about a mile from Barking&s;ide, &s;tands an oak, which has been known through many cen|turies, by the name of Fairlop. The tradition of the country traces it half way up the Chri&s;tian aera. It is &s;till a noble tree, tho it has now &s;uffered greatly from the depre|dations of time. About a yard from the ground, where it's rough fluted &s;tem is thirty-&s;ix feet in circumference, it divides into eleven va&s;t arms; yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak, but rather in that of a beech. Beneath it's &s;hade, which over&s;preads an area
<PB N="142" REF="164">
of three hundred feet in circuit, an annual fair has long been held, on the 2d of July; and no booth is &s;uffered to be erected beyond the extent of it's boughs. But as their ex|tremities are now become &s;aple&s;s, and age is yearly curtailing their length, the liberties of the fair &s;eem to be in a very de&s;ponding condition. The honour however is great. &mdash;But honours are often accompanied with inconveniences; and Fairlop has &s;uffered from it's honourable di&s;tinctions. In the fea&s;ting that attends a fair, fires are often nece&s;&s;ary; and no places &s;eemed &s;o proper to make them in, as the hollow cavities formed by the heaving roots of the tree. This practice has brought a &s;peedier decay on Fairlop, than it might otherwi&s;e have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Not far from Blanford, in Dor&s;et&s;hire, &s;tood very lately a tree, known by the name of Damory's oak. About five or &s;ix cen|turies ago, it was probably in a &s;tate of maturity. At the ground it's circumference was &s;ixty-eight feet; and &s;eventeen feet above the ground it's diameter was four yards. As this va&s;t trunk decayed, it became hollow,
<PB N="143" REF="165">
forming a cavity, which was fifteen feet wide, and &s;eventeen feet high, capable of holding twenty men. During the civil wars, and till after the re&s;toration, this cave was regularly inhabited by an old man, who &s;old ale in it. In the violent &s;torm in the year 1703, it &s;uffered greatly, many of it's noble&s;t limbs having been torn from it. But it was &s;till &s;o grand a ruin, above forty years after, that &s;ome of it's branches were &s;eventy-five feet high; and extended &s;eventy-two. In the year 1755 when it was fit for nothing but firewood, it was &s;old for fourteen pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hutchins's acc. of Dor&s;et&s;hire, vol. i. with a print of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In Torwood, in the county of Sterling, upon a little knoll, &s;tand at this time, the ruins of an oak, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t tree, that ever grew in Scotland. The trunk of it is now wholly decayed, and hollow: but it is evident, from what remains, that it's diameter could not have been le&s;s than eleven or twelve feet.&mdash;What it's age may be, is matter only of conjecture: but
<PB N="144" REF="166">
from &s;ome circum&s;tances, it is probably a tree of great antiquity. The little knoll it &s;tands on, is &s;urrounded by a &s;wamp, over which a cau&s;eway leads to the tree, or rather to a circle which &s;eems to have run round it. The ve&s;tiges of this circle, as well as the cau&s;eway, bear a plain re&s;emblance to tho&s;e works, which are commonly attributed to the Druids. So that it is probable, this tree was a &s;cene of wor&s;hip belonging to tho&s;e heathen prie&s;ts.&mdash;But the credit of it does not depend on the dubious ve&s;tiges of Druid antiquity. In a later &s;cene of greater impor|tance, (if tradition ever be the vehicle of truth) it bore a great &s;hare.&mdash;When that illu&s;trious hero, William Wallace, rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of the Scotch nation to oppo&s;e the tyranny of Edward, he often cho&s;e the &s;oli|tude of Torwood, as a place of rendezvous for his army. Here he concealed his num|bers, and his de&s;igns; &s;allying out &s;uddenly on the enemy's grri&s;ons, and retreating as &s;uddenly, when he feared to be overpowered. While his army lay in tho&s;e woods, the oak, which we are now commemorating, was com|monly his head-quarters. Here the hero generally &s;lept; it's hollow trunk being ca|pacious
<PB N="145" REF="167">
enough to afford &s;helter, not only to him&s;elf, but to &s;everal of his officers. This tree has ever &s;ince been known by the name of <HI>Wallace-tree;</HI> by which name it may ea&s;ily be found in Torwood to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Nimmo's hi&s;t. of Sterling&s;hire, p. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e celebrated trees we mu&s;t not forget Hern's oak in Wind&s;or fore&s;t. Shake|&s;pear tells us,
<Q><L>&mdash;an old tale goes, that Hern the hunter,</L>
<L>Sometime a keeper here in Wind&s;or fore&s;t,</L>
<L>Doth all the winter time, at &s;till of midnight,</L>
<L>Walk round about this oak, with ragged horns;</L>
<L>And then he bla&s;ts the trees, de&s;troys the cattle,</L>
<L>Makes the milch-cow yield blood, and &s;hakes a chain</L>
<L>In hideous, dreadful manner&mdash;</L></Q>
This tree, as far as we can pay credit to tradition, and general opinion, &s;till exi&s;ts. In the little park at Wind&s;or is a walk, known by the name of Queen Elizabeth's walk. It con&s;i&s;ts of elms, among which is a &s;ingle oak taken into the row, as if particularly meant to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, at the time, when the
<PB N="146" REF="168">
walk was laid out. This tree is &s;uppo&s;ed to be Hern's oak. It is a large tree, mea&s;uring about twenty-four feet in circum|ference, and is &s;till in great vigour; which I think, chiefly injures it's hi&s;torical credit. For tho it is evidently a tree in years, and might well have exi&s;ted in the time of Elizabeth, it &s;eems too &s;trong, and vigorous to have been a proper tree, in that age, for Hern, the hunter, to have danced round. Fairies, elves and that generation of people, univer&s;ally cho&s;e the mo&s;t ancient, and ve|nerable trees they could find, to gambol under: and the poet, who &s;hould de&s;cribe them dancing under a &s;aplin, would &s;hew little acquaintance with his &s;ubject. That this tree could not be called a venerable tree two hundred years ago, is evident; becau&s;e it hardly can a&s;&s;ume that character even now. And yet an oak, in a &s;oil it likes, will continue &s;o many years in a vigorous &s;tate, that we mu&s;t not lay more &s;tre&s;s on this argument, than it will fairly bear.&mdash;It may be added, however in it's favour, that a pit or ditch, is &s;till &s;hewn near the tree, as Shake&s;pear de&s;cribes it; which may have
<PB N="147" REF="169">
been pre&s;erved with the &s;ame veneration, as the tree it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is an oak, in the grounds of Sir Gerrard Van Neck, at Heveningham, in Suffolk, which carries us likewi&s;e into the times of Elizabeth. But this tree brings it's evidence with it&mdash;evidence, which, if nece&s;&s;ary, might carry it into Saxon times. It is now falling fa&s;t into the decline of years: and every year robs it more of it's honours. But it's trunk, which mea&s;ures thirty-five feet in circumference, &s;till retains it's grandeur; tho the ornaments of it's boughs, and foliage are much reduced. But the grandeur of the trunk con&s;i&s;ts only in appearance. It is a mere &s;hell. In Queen Elizabeth's time it was hollow; and from this circum&s;tance the tree derives the honour of being handed down to po&s;terity. That prince&s;s, who from her earlie&s;t age loved ma&s;culine amu&s;ements, u&s;ed often, it is &s;aid, in her youth, to take her &s;tand in this tree, and &s;hoot the deer as they pa&s;&s;ed. From that time it has been known by the name of Queen Elizabeth's oak.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="170">After celebrating the grandeur of the&s;e &s;ons of the fore&s;t, I &s;hould wi&s;h to introduce, in due &s;ubordination, two or three celebrated fruit trees.</P>
<P>In the deanery-garden at Winche&s;ter &s;tood lately, (&s;o lately as the year 1757) an ancient fig-tree. Through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many deans it had been ca&s;ed up, and &s;hielded from winds, and fro&s;t. The wall to which it was nailed, was adorned with various in&s;criptions, in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; alluding to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;acred writings, as do honour to the fig-tree. After having been pre&s;ented with &s;everal texts of &s;cripture, the reader was informed, by way of climax, that <HI>in the year</HI> 1623, <HI>king James I. ta&s;ted of the fruit of this fig-tree with great plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>At Lambeth likewi&s;e are two celebrated fig-trees; which, on good grounds, are &s;up|po&s;ed to have been planted by cardinal Pole. They are immen&s;e trees of the kind; covering a &s;pace of wall, fifty feet in height, and forty in breadth. The circumference of the &s;tem
<PB N="149" REF="171">
of one of them is twenty-eight inches, and of the other twenty-one. They are of the white Mar&s;eilles kind, and have for many years fur|ni&s;hed the tables of the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury with very delicious fruit.</P>
<P>Among other remarkable fruit trees may be reckoned a vine belonging to the late Sir Charles Raymond at Valentine-hou&s;e, near Ilford in E&s;&s;ex. It was planted, a cutting, in the year 1758, of the black Hambrugh &s;ort; and as this &s;pecies will not ea&s;ily bear the open air, it was planted in the hot-hou&s;e; tho without any preparation of &s;oil, which is in tho&s;e grounds a &s;tiff loam, or rather clay. The hot-hou&s;e is a very large one, about &s;eventy feet in front; and the vine, which I under&s;tand, is not pruned in the common way, extends two hundred feet, part of it running along the &s;outh wall on the out&s;ide of the hot-hou&s;e. In the common mode of pruning, this &s;pecies of vine is no great bearer; but managed as it is here, it produces wonder|fully. Sir Charles Raymond, on the death of his lady in 1778, left Valentine-hou&s;e; at which time the gardener had the profits of the
<PB N="150" REF="172">
vine. It annually produces about four hundred weight of grapes; which u&s;ed formerly (when the hot-hou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, was kept warmer,) to ripen in march: tho lately they have not ripened till june; when they &s;ell at four &s;hillings a pound; which produces about eighty pounds. This account I had from Mr. Eden him&s;elf, the gardener, who planted the vine.&mdash;With regard to the profits of it, I think it probable from the accounts I have had from other hands, that when the grapes ripened earlier, they produced much more than eighty pounds. A gentleman of character informed me, that he had it from Sir Charles Raymond him&s;elf, that after &s;upplying his own table, he has made one hundred and twenty pounds a year of the grapes; and the &s;ame gentleman, who was curious, inquired of the fruit dealers, who told him, that in &s;ome years, they &s;up|po&s;ed the profits have not amounted to le&s;s than three hundred pounds. This does not contradict Mr. Eden's account, who &s;aid, that the utmo&s;t he ever made of it (that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, when the grapes &s;old at four &s;hillings a pound in june) was eighty-four pounds. At the lowe&s;t calculation, the profits were pro|digious.&mdash;The
<PB N="151" REF="173">
&s;tem of this vine was, in the year 1789, thirteen inches in circumference.</P>
<P>But the vine, even as a timber-tree, hath it's place in hi&s;tory. Mr. Mi&s;&s;on, a traveller, of whom Mr. Addi&s;on &s;peaks with particular re&s;pect, tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mi&s;&s;on's travels in Italy.</NOTE>, that the gates of the great church at Ravenna in Italy were made of vine planks, twelve feet long, and fourteen or fifteen inches broad. The vine from which the&s;e planks were taken, mu&s;t have been an enor|mous vegetable of it's kind. Indeed, if the account had not been well atte&s;ted, it would have exceeded credit.&mdash;Mi&s;&s;on adds, that the &s;oil about Ravenna, on the &s;ide next the &s;ea, was remarkable for the enormous growth of vines; and he &s;uppo&s;es, it was owing to the rich manure left by the &s;ea. For tho the town of Ravenna in his day, &s;tood a league from the Adriatic; yet it is an undoubted fact, that the &s;ea formerly wa&s;hed it's walls; and that the pre&s;ent Ravenna occupies the &s;ite of the ancient Ravenna, which we know, was one
<PB N="152" REF="174">
of the be&s;t ports, the Romans had on the Adriatic.</P>
<P>Having thus given the hi&s;tory of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated trees on record, I cannot help &s;ubjoining an account of a few particular &s;pecies, which are remarkably &s;ingular.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the French academy we find a de&s;cription of a very curious tree, by Mr. Adan&s;on, called the Boabab. It is a native of Senegal, and has been taken notice of by Pro&s;per Alpinus, and other botani&s;ts: but Mr. Adan&s;on, who &s;pent &s;everal years in tho&s;e parts, &s;eems to have had the be&s;t opportunities of being acquainted with it.&mdash;As to it's botanical peculiarities, which are great; and it's phy&s;ical u&s;es, which are many, we enter not into them. We have only to do with it's external form, which is very &s;ingular. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t of nature's vege|table productions&mdash;the behemoth of the fore&s;t. From Mr. Adan&s;on's account one &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e the boabab to be a kind of natural pollard. He tells us, it's trunk &s;eldom ri&s;es higher than twelve feet; tho it's diameter exceeds &s;eventy. From this amazing trunk &s;pring a number of
<PB N="153" REF="175">
ma&s;&s;y branches. The center branch ri&s;es perpendicularly &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet: the lateral branches &s;hoot in angles le&s;s and le&s;s acute; till the lowe&s;t &s;eries form right angles with the trunk; and &s;o become quite horizontal. In this direction, they &s;tretch fifty or &s;ixty feet, till their weight brings them to the ground, with which the extremities of many of them are in contact. So that the whole tree has the appearance of a woody hemi&s;phere; who&s;e radius, including the thickne&s;s of the trunk, mu&s;t be about eighty, or ninety feet. &mdash;Whatever may be &s;aid for the peculiarity of &s;uch a tree, we cannot &s;ay much in favour of it's picture&s;que form. It &s;eems to be little more than a mon&s;trous bu&s;h. The bark of this tree is of an a&s;h-coloured tint. It's leaves are oval, pointed at the end, and about five inches long.&mdash;Tho the boabab is a native of Africa, yet a &s;mall one was found growing in the i&s;land of Martinico. It is &s;uppo&s;ed however to have been brought thither by &s;ome of the negroe-&s;laves; among whom it is common to carry &s;eeds of dif|ferent kinds, as charms and remedies: and it is certain, that many African plants have
<PB N="154" REF="176">
been propagated in the We&s;t-Indies in this accidental manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelin gives us the de&s;cription of another curious tree, called the Arbor de Rays, which is &s;ound chiefly in the Ea&s;t Indies, and is remarkable for the manner, in which it propagates. From the end of it's boughs it di&s;tills, in a continued vi&s;cous thread, a kind of gummy matter; which increa&s;es like an icicle, till it reach the ground, where it takes root, and becomes a &s;tem, putting forth new branches, and propagating anew; &s;o that a &s;ingle plant of this kind may in|crea&s;e into a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Strabo de&s;cribes an Indian tree, which I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, was the &s;ame with Mr. Evelin's arbor de Rays; only Strabo accounts more &s;imply for the mode of it's propagation. It's branches, he &s;ays, grow horizontally about twelve cubits; and then take a direc|tion to the earth, where they root them&s;elves; and when they have attained maturity, con|tinue to propagate in the &s;ame manner, till the ground is covered with them for a con|&s;iderable &s;pace; or, as Strabo more expre&s;&s;ively
<PB N="155" REF="177">
de&s;cribes it, till the whole becomes <HI>like a tent &s;upported by many columns</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, p. 694. edit. Caus.</NOTE>.&mdash;This &s;eems to be the tree, of which Milton &s;peaks;

<P><HI>Modern travellers</HI> &s;peak of an Indian tree like this, (the only tree of the kind they know,) which they call the Banian tree, or Indian fig. In it's mode of propagation, it corre&s;ponds rather with Strabo's de&s;cription, than Evelin's. We are informed however, that, altho common in India, it is not very commonly found in that &s;tate of grandeur, in which it is here de&s;cribed. Nor indeed will it ea&s;ily take that very regular form, without &s;ome little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. In|&s;tead of the <HI>Indian herd&s;man,</HI> whom Milton introduces, it is often at this day, inhabited
<PB N="156" REF="178">
by a Bramin; who builds his little reed|thatched &s;hed again&s;t it's trunk; and amu&s;es his lei&s;ure by directing it's lengthening branches into proper places; and forming each into a regular arch. Here, dre&s;&s;ed in a long white tunic, the habit of his order, and adorned with a flowing beard, he &s;pends his &s;olitary hours in wandering among the verdant allies of his tree, &s;carce ever leaving it's limits. The inhabitants of the di&s;trict re&s;ort daily to him with the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and receive, in return, his prayers, and benedic|tions.</P>
<P>There is a tree in the i&s;land of Java, called the Upas, or poi&s;on-tree, which (in the hi&s;tory of curious trees) &s;hould not be omitted; tho the accounts of it are &s;o wonderful, that &s;ome have e&s;teemed them fabulous. They are given to the public by a &s;urgeon, be|longing to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company, of the name of Foer&s;ch, who was &s;tationed at Batavia in the year 1774. Surprizing however as the&s;e accounts may be, they are accompanied with &s;o many public facts; and names of per&s;ons, and places, that it is
<PB N="157" REF="179">
&s;omewhat difficult to conceive them fabulous. &mdash;The abridged narrative of this &s;trange production, is this.</P>
<P>The Upas grows about twenty-&s;even leagues from Batavia, in a plain &s;urrounded by rocky mountains; the whole of which plain, con|taining a circle of ten, or twelve miles round the tree, is totally barren. Nothing, that breathes, or vegetates, can live within it's influence. The bird, that flies over it, drops down dead. The bea&s;t, that wanders into it, expires. The whole dreadful area is covered with &s;and, over which lie &s;cattered loo&s;e flints, and whitening bones.&mdash;This tree may be called the emperor's great military magazine. In a &s;olution of the poi&s;onous gum, which exudes from it, his arrows, and offen&s;ive weapons are dipped. The procuring there|fore of this poi&s;onous gum, is a matter of as much attention, as of difficulty. Criminals only are employed in this dreadful &s;ervice. Of the&s;e &s;everal, every year, are &s;ent with a promi&s;e of pardon, and reward, if they procure it. Hooded in leathern ca&s;es, with gla&s;s eylet-holes, and &s;ecured as much as po&s;&s;ible from the full effluvia of the air they are to breathe, they undertake this melancholy
<PB N="158" REF="180">
journey; travelling always with the wind. About one in ten e&s;capes, and brings away a little box of this direful commodity.</P>
<P>Of the dreadful, and &s;udden effect of this poi&s;on, the author &s;aw many in&s;tances. He mentions, among others, the execution of thirteen young ladies of the emperor's &s;eraglio; who having been convicted of infidelity to his bed, were condemned to die by the poi&s;on of Upas; which is con&s;idered in Java, like the axe in England, as an honourable in|&s;trument of death. At eleven o'clock in the forenoon the&s;e unhappy victims were led into a court in the palace, where a row of thirteen po&s;ts had been erected. To the&s;e they were bound. As they &s;tood trembling, they were obliged to confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of their &s;entence; which each of them did, by laying one hand on the koran, and the other on her brea&s;t. When the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions were fini&s;hed, and a few religious ceremonies, on a &s;ign given by the judge, an executioner &s;tepped forward, who bared their brea&s;ts, and amid&s;t their cries, and &s;hrieks, with a poi&s;oned lancet made a &s;light inci&s;ion in each. The author &s;ays, he &s;tood by with his watch in his hand. In five minutes they were &s;eized with con|vul&s;ive
<PB N="159" REF="181">
&s;pa&s;ms&mdash;excruciating agonies &s;ucceeded; and in &s;ixteen minutes they were all dead. A frightful change came on. From being objects of beauty, they became &s;pectacles of horror. Livid &s;pots broke out upon them. Their faces &s;welled: their cheeks became blue; and their eyes, yellow.</P>
<P>The author &s;ays, that on the coa&s;t of Maca&s;&s;ar, there are found trees very like the Upas of Java; but not &s;o malignant. If &s;o, it is probable, that all the&s;e trees are of the &s;ame kind; only the Java-Upas has found a &s;ituation, where it's poi&s;onous qualities are more &s;ublimed.</P>
<P>Dr. Darwin, in his <HI>Loves of the plants,</HI> has given us a picture of the &s;ituation of this dreadful tree; the exi&s;tence of which he &s;eems to believe.</P>

<P>That I may connect this little biographical hi&s;tory of trees with the principal &s;ubject of my book, I &s;hall conclude it with an account of three celebrated trees from New-fore&s;t, in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention, is that famous tree, again&s;t which the arrow of Sir Walter Tyrrel glanced, which killed William Rufus.</P>
<P>Leland tells us, and Camden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Camden's account of New-fore&s;t.</NOTE> from him, that the death of Rufus happened at a place in New-fore&s;t, called Througham, where a chapel was erected to his memory. But I meet with no place of the name of Througham in New-fore&s;t; and neither the remains, nor the remembrance of any chapel. It is pro|bable, that <HI>Througham</HI> might be what is now called <HI>Fritham;</HI> where the tradition of the country &s;eems to have fixed the <HI>&s;pot</HI> with more credibility from <HI>the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI>&mdash;The chapel might only have been &s;ome little temporary oratory, which having never been endowed,
<PB N="161" REF="183">
might &s;peedily have fallen to decay: but the tree, it is probable, would be noticed at the time by every body, who lived near it; and by &s;trangers, who came to &s;ee it: and it is as probable, that it could never be forgotten afterwards. They who think a tree in&s;ufficient to record a fact of &s;o ancient a date, may be reminded, that &s;even hundred years, (and it is not more &s;ince the death of Rufus) make no extraordinary period in the exi&s;tence of an oak. About fifty years ago however, this tree became &s;o decayed, and mutilated, that, in all pro|bability, the &s;pot would have been forgotten, if &s;ome other memorial had not been rai&s;ed. Before the &s;tump therefore was eradicated, a triangular &s;tone was erected, by the late lord Delaware, who lived in one of the neigh|bouring lodges; on the three &s;ides of which &s;tone the following in&s;criptions are engraven.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here &s;tood the oak-tree, on which an arrow, &s;hot by &s;ir Walter Tyrrel at a &s;tag, glanced, and &s;truck king William II. &s;urnamed Rufus, in the brea&s;t, of which &s;troke he in&s;tantly died, on the 2d of augu&s;t 1100.</P>
<P N="2">2. King William II. being thus &s;lain, was laid on a cart, belonging to one Purke&s;s; and
<PB N="162" REF="184">
drawn from hence to Winche&s;ter, and buried in the cathedral church of that city.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the &s;pot, where an event &s;o memorable, happened, might not hereafter be unknown; this &s;tone was &s;et up by John lord Delaware, who has &s;een the tree growing in this place.</P>
<P>Lord Delaware a&s;&s;erts plainly, that he had &s;een the oak-tree; and as he lived much on the &s;pot, he had probably other grounds for the a&s;&s;ertion, be&s;ides the tradition of the country. That matter however re&s;ts on his authority.</P>
<P>The next tree I &s;hall exhibit from New-fore&s;t, is the <HI>groaning-tree</HI> of Bade&s;ly; a village about two miles from Lymington. The hi&s;tory of the groaning-tree is this. About forty years ago, a cottager, who lived near the centre of the village, heard frequently a &s;trange noi&s;e, behind his hou&s;e, like that of a per&s;on in extreme agony. Soon after, it caught the attention of his wife, who was then confined to her bed. She was a timorous woman, and being greatly alarmed, her hu&s;|band endeavoured to per&s;uade her, that the
<PB N="163" REF="185">
noi&s;e &s;he heard, was only the bellowing of the &s;tags in the fore&s;t. By degrees, however, the neighbours, on all &s;ides heard it; and the thing began to be much talked of. It was by this time plainly di&s;covered, that the groaning noi&s;e proceeded from an elm, which grew at the end of the garden. It was a young, vigorous tree; and to all appearance perfectly &s;ound.</P>
<P>In a few weeks the fame of the groaning tree was &s;pread far and wide; and people from all parts flocked to hear it. Among others it attracted the curio&s;ity of the late prince, and prince&s;s of Wales, who re&s;ided, at that time, for the advantage of a &s;ea-bath, at Pilewell, the &s;eat of Sir James Wor&s;ley, which &s;tood within a quarter of a mile of the groaning tree.</P>
<P>Tho the country people a&s;&s;igned many &s;uper|&s;titious cau&s;es for this &s;trange phenomenon, the naturali&s;t could a&s;&s;ign no phy&s;ical one, that was in any degree &s;atisfactory. Some thought, it was owing to the twi&s;ting and friction of the roots. Others thought it pro|ceeded from water, which had collected in the body of the tree&mdash;or perhaps from pent air. But no cau&s;e that was alledged, appeared equal to the effect. In the mean time, the tree
<PB N="164" REF="186">
did not always groan; &s;ometimes di&s;appoint|ing it's vi&s;itants: yet no cau&s;e could be a&s;|&s;igned for it's temporary ce&s;&s;ations, either from &s;ea&s;ons, or weather. If any difference was ob&s;erved; it was thought to groan lea&s;t, when the weather was wet; and mo&s;t when it was clear, and fro&s;ty: but the &s;ound at all times &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the root.</P>
<P>Thus the groaning tree continued an object of a&s;toni&s;hment, during the &s;pace of eighteen, or twenty months, to all the country around: and for the information of di&s;tant parts a pamphlet was drawn up, containing a par|ticular account of all the circum&s;tances re|lating to it.</P>
<P>At length, the owner of it, a gentleman of the name of Forbes, making too ra&s;h an experiment to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, bored a hole in it's trunk. After this it never groaned. It was then rooted up, with a further view to make a di&s;covery: but &s;till nothing appeared, which led to any inve&s;ti|gation of the cau&s;e. It was univer&s;ally how|ever believed, that there was no trick in the affair: but that &s;ome natural cau&s;e really exi&s;ted, tho never under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="187">The la&s;t celebrated tree, which I &s;hall pre&s;ent to the reader from New-fore&s;t, is the Cadenham oak, which buds every year in the depth of winter. Cadenham is a village, about three miles from Lyndhur&s;t, on the Sali&s;bury road.</P>
<P>Having often heard of this oak, I took a ride to &s;ee it on the 29th of december, 1781. It was pointed out to me among &s;everal other oaks, &s;urrounded by a little fore&s;t &s;tream, winding round a knoll, on which they &s;tood. It is a tall, &s;traight plant of no great age, and apparently vigorous; except that it's top has been injured; from which &s;everal branches i&s;&s;ue in the form of pollard &s;hoots. It was intirely bare of leaves, as far as I could di&s;cern, when I &s;aw it; and undi&s;tingui&s;hable from the other oaks in it's neighbourhood; except that it's bark &s;eemed rather &s;moother; occa&s;ioned, I apprehended, only by frequent climbing.</P>
<P>Having had the account of it's <HI>early budding</HI> confirmed on the &s;pot, I engaged one Michael Lawrence, who kept the white hart, a &s;mall
<PB N="166" REF="188">
ale-hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, to &s;end me &s;ome of the leaves to Vicar's hill, as &s;oon as they &s;hould appear. The man, who had not the lea&s;t doubt about the matter, kept his word; and &s;ent me &s;everal twigs, on the morning of the 5th of january, 1782; a few hours after they had been gathered. The leaves were fairly expanded; and about an inch in length. From &s;ome of the buds two leaves had un&s;heathed them&s;elves; but in general only one.</P>
<P>Through what power in nature this &s;trange, premature vegetation is occa&s;ioned, I believe no naturali&s;t can explain. I &s;ent &s;ome of the leaves to one of the able&s;t botani&s;ts we have, Mr. Lightfoot, author of the Flora Scotica; and was in hopes of hearing &s;omething &s;ati&s;|factory on the &s;ubject. But he is one of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who is not a&s;hamed of igno|rance, where attempts at knowledge are mere conjecture. He a&s;&s;ured me, that he neither could account for it in any way; nor did he know of any other in&s;tance of premature vegetation, except the Gla&s;tonbury-thorn.</P>
<P>The <HI>philo&s;ophers of the fore&s;t,</HI> in the mean|time, account for the thing at once, through the influence of old Chri&s;tmas-day; univer|&s;ally
<PB N="167" REF="189">
believing that the oak buds on that day, and that only. The &s;ame opinion is held with regard to the Gla&s;tonbury-thorn by the common people of the we&s;t of England. But without doubt, the germi|nation there is gradual; and forwarded, or retarded by the mildne&s;s, or &s;everity of the weather. One of it's progeny, which grew in the gardens of the duche&s;s dowager of Portland, at Bul&s;trode, had it's flower-buds perfectly formed, &s;o early, as the 21&s;t of december, 1781; which is fifteen days earlier than it ought to flower, according to the vulgar prejudice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Sali&s;bury journal january 10th 1786, the following paragraph appeared.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a report, that has prevailed in this country for upwards of two centuries, and which by many has been almo&s;t con&s;idered as a matter of faith, that the oak at Caden|ham, in the New-fore&s;t, &s;hoots forth leaves on every old Chri&s;tmas-day, and that no leaf is ever to be &s;een on it, either before, or after that day, during the winter; a lady, who is now on a vi&s;it in this city, and who is attentively curious in every thing relative to art or nature, made a journey to Cadenham on monday the 3d in&s;tant, purpo&s;ely to enquire, on the &s;pot, about the production of this famous tree. On her arrival near it, the u&s;ual guide was ready to attend her; but on his being de&s;ired to climb the oak, and to &s;earch whether there were any leaves then on it, he &s;aid it would be to no purpo&s;e, but that if &s;he would come on the wedne&s;day fol|lowing, (Chri&s;tmas-day) &s;he might certainly &s;ee thou&s;ands. However he was prevailed on to a&s;cend, and on the fir&s;t branch which he gathered, appeared &s;everal fair new leaves, fre&s;h &s;prouted from the buds, and nearly an inch and a half in length. It may be imagined, that the guide was more amazed at this premature production than the lady; for &s;o &s;trong was his belief in the truth of the whole tradition, that he would have pledged his life, that not a leaf was to have been di&s;covered on any part of the tree before the u&s;ual hour.</P>
<P>But tho the &s;uper&s;titious part of this ancient legend is hence confuted, yet it mu&s;t be allowed that there is &s;omething very uncommon and curious in an oak's con&s;tantly &s;hooting forth leaves at this un&s;ea&s;onable time of the year, and that the cau&s;e of it well de&s;erves the philo&s;ophical attention of the botani&s;t. In &s;ome years there is no doubt but that this oak may &s;hew it's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> leaves on the Chri&s;tmas morning, as probably as on a few days before; and this perhaps was the ca&s;e in the la&s;t year, when a gentleman of this neighbourhood, a nice and critical ob&s;erver, &s;trictly examined the branches, not only on the Chri&s;tmas morn, but al&s;o on the day prior to it. On the fir&s;t day not a leaf was to be found, but on the following every branch had it's complement, tho they were then but ju&s;t &s;hooting from the buds, none of them being more than a quarter of an inch long. The latter part of the &s;tory may ea&s;ily be credited, that no leaves are to be &s;een on it after Chri&s;tmas-day, as large parties yearly a&s;&s;emble about the oak on that morning, and regularly &s;trip every appearance of a leaf from it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="190">This early &s;pring however of the Cadenham oak is of very &s;hort duration. The buds, after unfolding them&s;elves, make no farther

progre&s;s; but immediately &s;hrink from the &s;ea&s;on, and die.

I have &s;een it, in full leaf, in the middle of &s;ummer, when it appeared both in it's form, and foliage, exactly like other oaks.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that another tree with the &s;ame property of early germination, has lately been found near the &s;pot, where Rufus's monument &s;tands. If this be the ca&s;e, it &s;eems, in &s;ome degree to authenticate the account which Camden <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Camden's account of New-fore&s;t.</NOTE> gives us of the &s;cene of that prince's death: for he &s;peaks of the premature vegetation of that very tree, on which the arrow of Tyrrel glanced; and the tree I now &s;peak of, if it really exi&s;t, tho I have no &s;ufficient authority for it, might have been a de&s;cendant of the old oak, and have inherited it's virtues.</P>
<P>It is very probable however there may be other oaks in the fore&s;t, which may like|wi&s;e have the property of early germination. I have heard it often &s;u&s;pected, that people
<PB N="170" REF="192">
gather buds from other trees, and carry them, on old Chri&s;tmas-day, to the oak at Cadenham, from whence they pretended to pluck them. For that tree is in &s;uch repute; and re&s;orted to annually by &s;o many vi&s;itants, that I think it could not ea&s;ily &s;upply all it's votaries, without &s;ome foreign contri|butions.&mdash;Some have accounted for this phenomenon by &s;uppo&s;ing that leaves have been pre&s;erved over the year by being &s;teeped in vinegar. But I am well &s;atisfied this is not the ca&s;e. Mr. Lightfoot, to whom I &s;ent the leaves, had no &s;uch &s;u&s;picion.</P>

<P>FROM con&s;idering trees as <HI>individuals,</HI> we proceed next to con&s;ider them under their various <HI>combinations;</HI> among which, <HI>clumps</HI> are the &s;imple&s;t.</P>
<P>What number of trees make a <HI>clump,</HI> no rules of art pre&s;cribe. The term has rather a <HI>relative</HI> meaning.&mdash;In &s;cenes, brought near the eye, we call three or four trees a clump. But in di&s;tant and exten&s;ive &s;cenery, we &s;cruple not to u&s;e the term for any &s;maller detached part of a wood, tho it may con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome hundreds.&mdash;But tho the term admits not of exact definition, I &s;hall en|deavour
<PB N="172" REF="194">
by amplification, to make the ideas contained under it, as di&s;tinct as I can.</P>
<P>We di&s;tingui&s;h then two kinds of clumps; the <HI>&s;maller,</HI> and the <HI>larger;</HI> confining the former chiefly to the <HI>foreground;</HI> and con|&s;idering the latter as the ornament of a <HI>di&s;|tance.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>&s;maller clump,</HI> the chief beauty we expect here, ari&s;es from <HI>contra&s;t in the parts.</HI> We have &s;een that in <HI>&s;ingle trees,</HI> each mu&s;t have it's characteri&s;tic beauty. It has nothing el&s;e to depend on. But in <HI>combination,</HI> the beauty of the <HI>individual</HI> is not required; the <HI>whole clump together</HI> mu&s;t produce the effect.</P>
<P>To enumerate all the &s;ources of beautiful contra&s;t, which contribute to produce this effect, might be difficult. I &s;hall cur&s;orily &s;ugge&s;t a few.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place the <HI>relative</HI> &s;ituation of trees, with regard to <HI>each other,</HI> &s;hould be con&s;idered. Three trees, or more, &s;tanding in a line, are formal. In the natural wood, you rarely &s;ee this formality.&mdash;And yet even <HI>three trees in a line</HI> will be greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="173" REF="195">
the lines of the &s;everal trunks taking different directions; and by the various forms, di&s;tances, and growth of the trees.</P>
<P>If three trees do not &s;tand in a line, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e &s;tand in a triangle; which pro|duces a great variety of plea&s;ing forms.</P>
<P>If a fourth tree be added, it &s;tands beautifully near the middle of the triangle, of whatever form the triangle may be. If it be equilateral, and the tree placed exactly in the middle, there are three points, as you walk round the triangle, from which it will appear offen&s;ively regular.&mdash;Remarks however of this kind affect only young trees, while their &s;tems are tall, and &s;imilar. As they increa&s;e, their different modes of growth&mdash;the &s;welling of their roots&mdash; the habits they contract from wind&mdash;their ramification&mdash;their lateral branches, and other accidental circum&s;tances introduce endle&s;s vari|eties among them; and blot out many of tho&s;e little formalities, which attend their youth: tho, after all, the <HI>artificial</HI> clump will rarely attain the beauty of the <HI>natural</HI> one.</P>
<P>If the <HI>clump</HI> con&s;i&s;t of &s;till more trees than four, a greater variety among the &s;tems will of cour&s;e take place&mdash;double triangles, irregular quincunxes, and other plea&s;ing &s;hapes, which
<PB N="174" REF="196">
may be &s;een exemplified in every wood of natural growth.</P>
<P>The branches al&s;o are as much a &s;ource of contra&s;t, as the &s;tem. To be picture&s;que they mu&s;t intermingle with each other without heavine&s;s&mdash;they mu&s;t hang loo&s;ely, but yet with <HI>varied loo&s;ene&s;s</HI> on every &s;ide&mdash;and if there be one &s;uperior apex, there may be two or three others, that are &s;ubordinate, according to the &s;ize of the clump.</P>
<P>Different kinds of trees al&s;o, in the &s;ame clump, occa&s;ion often a beautiful contra&s;t. There are few trees, which will not harmonize with trees of a different kind: tho perhaps the mo&s;t &s;imple, and beautiful contra&s;ts ari&s;e from the various modes of growth in the &s;ame &s;pecies. We often &s;ee two or three oaks inter|mingle their branches together in a very plea&s;ing manner. When the beech is full grown, it is generally, (in a luxuriant &s;oil at lea&s;t,) &s;o heavy, that it rarely blends happily either with it's own kind, or with any other. The &s;ilver-fir too, we have ob&s;erved, is a very unaccommodating tree.&mdash;So al&s;o are other firs; indeed all that taper to a point. Not &s;o the pine-race. They are clump-headed; and unite well in compo&s;ition. With the&s;e al&s;o
<PB REF="197">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="175" REF="198">
the Scotch-fir leagues; from little knots of which we often &s;ee beautiful contra&s;ts ari&s;e. When they are young, and luxuriant, e&s;peci|ally if any number of them above four, or five, are planted together, they generally form a heavy murky &s;pot: but as they acquire age, this heavine&s;s goes off, the inner branches decay, the outward branches hang loo&s;ely, and negligently; and the whole has often a good effect; unle&s;s they have been planted too clo&s;ely. I am rather doubtful, how far deci|duous trees mix well in a clump with ever|greens: and yet we &s;ometimes &s;ee a natural good effect of light, and &s;hade, from the darkne&s;s of the fir contra&s;ting agreeably with the &s;prightly green of a deciduous tree, ju&s;t coming into leaf. In this however I am clear, that if they are mixed, they ought not to be planted, as they often are, alternately; but each kind together.</P>
<P>Contra&s;ts again ari&s;e from the mixture of trees of unequal growth&mdash;from a young tree united with an old one&mdash;a &s;tunted tree with a luxuriant one&mdash;and &s;ometimes from two or three trees, which in them&s;elves are ill-&s;haped, but when combined, are plea&s;ing. Inequalities
<PB N="176" REF="199">
of all the&s;e kinds are what chiefly give nature's planting a &s;uperiority over art.</P>
<P>The form of the foliage is another &s;ource of contra&s;t. In one part, where the branches intermingle, the foliage will be interwoven and clo&s;e; in another, where the boughs of each tree hang &s;eparately, the appearance will be light and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>But whatever beauty the&s;e <HI>contra&s;ts</HI> exhibit, the effect is totally lo&s;t, unle&s;s the <HI>clump</HI> be <HI>well-balanced.</HI> This is as nece&s;&s;ary in a <HI>com|bination of trees,</HI> as in a <HI>&s;ingle tree</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 6.</NOTE>. The clump is con&s;idered as <HI>one</HI> object: and the &s;upport of the <HI>whole</HI> mu&s;t depend on the &s;everal trunks, and leading branches, of which it is compo&s;ed. We do not expect the minu|tiae of &s;cale and weight: if no &s;ide prepon|derate, &s;o as to hurt the eye, it is enough.&mdash; Unle&s;s however the clump have &s;uffered &s;ome external injury, it is &s;eldom deficient in point of balance. Nature always conducts the &s;tems and branches in &s;uch ea&s;y forms, wherever there is an opening; and fills up all with &s;o much nice contrivance, and at the &s;ame time,
<PB REF="200">

with &s;o much picture&s;que irregularity; that we rarely wi&s;h for an amendment in her works. So true indeed this is, that nothing is &s;o dangerous as to take away a tree from a clump. You will infallibly de&s;troy the balance, which can never again be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Thus far we have con&s;idered a <HI>clump,</HI> as a <HI>&s;ingle independent</HI> object&mdash;as the object of a <HI>foreground</HI>&mdash;con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch a confined num|ber of trees, as the eye can fairly include at once. And when trees &s;trike our fancy, either in the wild &s;cenes of nature; or in the im|provements of art, they will ever be found in combinations &s;imilar to the&s;e.</P>
<P>When the <HI>clump</HI> grows <HI>larger,</HI> it becomes qualified only as a <HI>remote object</HI>&mdash;combining with va&s;t woods; and forming a part of &s;ome exten&s;ive &s;cene, either as a fir&s;t, a &s;econd, or a third di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The great u&s;e of the <HI>larger clump</HI> is to lighten the heavine&s;s of a <HI>continued di&s;tant wood;</HI> and connect it gently with the plain: that the tran&s;ition may not be too abrupt. All we wi&s;h to find in a clump of this kind, is <HI>proportion,</HI> and <HI>general form.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="203">With re&s;pect to <HI>proportion,</HI> the detached clump mu&s;t not incroach too much on the dignity of the wood, it aids; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve a proper &s;ubordination. A large tract of country covered with wood, will admit &s;everal of the&s;e auxiliary clumps of different dimen&s;ions. But if the wood be of a &s;maller &s;ize, the clumps al&s;o mu&s;t be &s;maller, and fewer.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>general form</HI> of the larger clump, we ob&s;erved that in a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> tree, we expected elegance in the <HI>parts.</HI> In the <HI>&s;maller clumps</HI> this idea was relinqui&s;hed, and in it's room we expected a <HI>general contra&s;t</HI> in trunks, branches, and foliage. But as the clump becomes larger, and recedes in the land&s;cape, all the&s;e plea&s;ing contra&s;ts are lo&s;t, and we are &s;atisfied with a <HI>general form.</HI> No <HI>regular</HI> form is plea&s;ing. A clump on the &s;ide of a hill, or in any &s;ituation, where the eye can more ea&s;ily inve&s;tigate it's &s;hape, mu&s;t be circum&s;cribed by an irregular line; in which it is required that the undulations both at the ba&s;e, and &s;ummit of the clump &s;hould be &s;trongly marked; as the eye probably has a di&s;tinct view of both. But if it be &s;een only on the top of a hill, or along the di&s;tant
<PB N="179" REF="204">
horizon, (as in the&s;e &s;ituations the ba&s;e is commonly lo&s;t in the varieties of the ground) a little variation in the line, which forms the &s;ummit, &s;o as to break any di&s;agreeable regularity there, will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>As a large tract of wood requires a few large clumps to connect it gently with the plain; &s;o the&s;e large clumps them&s;elves require the &s;ame &s;ervice from a &s;ingle tree, or a few trees, according to their &s;ize.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations re&s;pect chiefly the va&s;t &s;cenes of nature, which are but little under the controul of art. While they a&s;&s;i&s;t us however in judging of the natural &s;cene, they are in many re&s;pects applicable to the em|belli&s;hed one. To the painters u&s;e, they are mo&s;t adapted; who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to introduce his trees in the happie&s;t manner; whether he &s;pread them over his canvas in va&s;t woods; or break them into <HI>&s;maller,</HI> or <HI>larger combi|nations.</HI></P>

<P>FROM <HI>clumps</HI> we naturally proceed to <HI>park-&s;cenery,</HI> which is generally compo&s;ed of <HI>combinations of clumps,</HI> inter&s;per&s;ed with lawns. It is &s;eldom compo&s;ed of any large di&s;trict of wood; which is the characteri&s;tic of fore&s;t-&s;cenery.</P>
<P>The park, which is a &s;pecies of land&s;cape little known, except in England, is one of the noble&s;t appendages of a great hou&s;e. Nothing gives a man&s;ion &s;o much dignity as the&s;e home demei&s;ns; nor contributes more to mark it's con&s;equence. A great hou&s;e, in a cour&s;e of years, naturally acquires &s;pace around it. A noble park therefore is the natural appendage of an ancient man&s;ion.</P>
<P>To the &s;ize, and grandeur of the hou&s;e, the park &s;hould be proportioned. <HI>Blenheim-ca&s;tle</HI> with a paddock around it; or a &s;mall
<PB N="182" REF="206">
villa in the middle of Wood&s;tock-park, would be equally out of place.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e &s;hould &s;tand nearly in the centre of the park; that is, it &s;hould have ample room about it on every &s;ide. Petworth-hou&s;e, one of the grande&s;t piles in England, lo&s;es much of it's grandeur from being placed at the extremity of the park, where it is elbowed by a church-yard.</P>
<P>The <HI>exact &s;pot</HI> depends intirely on the ground. There are grand &s;ituations of various kinds. In general, hou&s;es are built fir&s;t; and parks are added afterwards by the occa&s;ional removal of inclo&s;ures. A great hou&s;e &s;tands mo&s;t nobly on an elevated knoll, from whence it may overlook the di&s;tant country; while the woods of the park &s;kreen the regularity of the intervening cultivation. Or it &s;tands well on the &s;ide of a valley, which winds along it's front; and is adorned with wood, or a natural &s;tream hiding, and di&s;covering it&s;elf among the clumps at the bottom of the vale. Or it &s;tands with dignity, as Longleat does, in the centre of demei&s;ns, which &s;helve gently down to it on every &s;ide.&mdash;Even on a dead flat I have &s;een a hou&s;e draw beauties around it. At the &s;eat of the late Mr. Bil&s;on Legge, (now
<PB N="183" REF="207">
lord Stawel's) in the middle of Holt-fore&s;t, a lawn unvaried by a &s;ingle &s;well, is yet varied with clumps of different forms, receding behind each other, in &s;o plea&s;ing a manner, as to make an agreeable &s;cene.</P>
<P>By the&s;e ob&s;ervations I mean only to &s;hew, that in whatever part of a park a hou&s;e may have been originally placed, it can hardly have been placed &s;o awkwardly, but that, in &s;ome way or other, the &s;cenery may be happily adapted to it. There are &s;ome &s;ituations indeed &s;o very untoward, that &s;carce any remedy can be applied: as when the front of a hou&s;e immediately urges on a ri&s;ing ground. But &s;uch awkward &s;ituations are rare; and in general, the variety of land&s;cape is &s;uch, that it may almo&s;t always be brought in one form, or other, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of beauty. The many improvements of the ingenious Mr. Brown, in various parts of England, bear witne&s;s to the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations.&mdash; The beauty however of park-&s;cenery is un|doubtedly <HI>be&s;t</HI> di&s;played on a <HI>varied &s;urface</HI>&mdash; where the ground &s;wells, and falls&mdash;where hanging lawns, &s;kreened with wood, are con|nected with vallies&mdash;and where one part is continually playing in contra&s;t with another.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="208">As the park is an appendage of the hou&s;e, it follows, that it &s;hould participate of it's neatne&s;s, and elegance. Nature, in all her great walks of land&s;cape, ob&s;erves this accom|modating rule. She &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es abruptly from one mode of &s;cenery to another; but generally connects different &s;pecies of land&s;cape by &s;ome third &s;pecies, which participates of both. A mountainous country rarely &s;inks immediately into a level one; the &s;wellings and heavings of the earth, grow gradually le&s;s. Thus as the hou&s;e is connected with the country through the medium of the park; the park &s;hould partake of the neatne&s;s of the one, and of the wildne&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>As the park is a &s;cene either planted by art, or, if naturally woody, artificially improved, we expect a beauty, and contra&s;t in it's <HI>clumps,</HI> which we do not look for in the wild &s;cenes of nature. We expect to &s;ee it's lawns, and their appendages, contra&s;ted with each other, in &s;hape, &s;ize, and di&s;po&s;ition; from which a variety of artificial &s;cenes will ari&s;e. We expect, that when trees are left &s;tanding as <HI>individuals,</HI> they &s;hould be the mo&s;t beautiful of their kind, elegant and well-balanced. We expect, that all offen&s;ive trumpery, and all the
<PB N="185" REF="209">
rough luxuriance of undergrowth, &s;hould be removed; unle&s;s where it is nece&s;&s;ary to thicken, or connect a &s;cene; or hide &s;ome &s;taring boundary. In the wild &s;cenes of nature we have grander exhibitions, but greater defor|mities, than are generally met with in the works of art. As we &s;eldom meet with the&s;e &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ages in improved land&s;cape; it would be unpardonable if any thing di&s;gu&s;ting &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>In the park-&s;cene we wi&s;h for no expen&s;ive ornament. Temples, Chine&s;e-bridges, obe|li&s;ks, and all the laboured works of art, &s;ugge&s;t inharmonious ideas. If a bridge be nece&s;&s;ary, let it be elegantly plain. If a deer-&s;hed, or a keeper's lodge be required; let the fa&s;hion of each be as &s;imple, as it's u&s;e. Let nothing appear with o&s;tentation, or parade.&mdash;Within re&s;trictions however of this kind we mean not to include piles of <HI>&s;uperior grandeur.</HI> Such a palace as Blenheim-ca&s;tle di&s;tributes it's great|ne&s;s far and wide. There, if the bridge be immen&s;e, or the obeli&s;k &s;uperb, it is only what we naturally expect. It is the chain of ideas properly carried on, and <HI>gradually lo&s;t.</HI> My remarks regard only &s;uch hou&s;es, as may
<PB N="186" REF="210">
be rich indeed, and elegant; but have nothing in them of <HI>&s;uperior magnificence.</HI></P>
<P>One ornament of this kind, I &s;hould be in|clined to allow; and that is a hand&s;ome gate at the entrance of the park: but it &s;hould be proportioned in richne&s;s, and elegance to the hou&s;e; and &s;hould al&s;o corre&s;pond with it in &s;tile. It &s;hould rai&s;e the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of what you are to expect. Warwick-ca&s;tle re|quires a mode of entrance very different from lord Scar&s;dale's at Kettle&s;tone; and Burleigh-hou&s;e, very different from both. The park-gate of Sion-hou&s;e is certainly elegant; but it rai&s;es the idea of a &s;tile of architecture, which you mu&s;t drop, when you arrive at the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The road al&s;o through the park &s;hould bear the &s;ame proportion. It &s;hould be &s;pacious, or moderate, like the hou&s;e it approaches. Let it wind: but let it not take any deviation, which is not well accounted for. To have the convenience of winding along a valley, or pa&s;&s;ing a commodious bridge, or avoiding a wood, or a piece of water, any traveller would naturally wi&s;h to deviate a little; and ob&s;tacles of this kind, if nece&s;&s;ary, mu&s;t be interpo&s;ed. Mr. Brown was often very happy in creating the&s;e artificial ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="211">From every part of the approach, and from the ridings, and favourite walks about the park, let all the boundaries be &s;ecreted. A view of paling, tho in &s;ome ca&s;es it may be picture&s;que, is in general di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>If there be a <HI>natural</HI> river, or a real ruin in the &s;cene, it may be a happy circum&s;tance: let the be&s;t u&s;e be made of it: but I &s;hould be cautious in advi&s;ing the <HI>creation</HI> of either. At lea&s;t, I have rarely &s;een either ruins, or rivers well manufactured. Mr. Brown, I think, has failed more in river-making than in any of his attempts. An artificial lake has &s;ometimes a good effect; but neither pro|priety, nor beauty can ari&s;e from it, unle&s;s the heads and extremities of it are perfectly well managed, and concealed: and after all, the &s;ucce&s;s is hazardous. You mu&s;t always &s;up|po&s;e it a portion of a larger piece of water; and it is not ea&s;y to carry on the impo&s;ition. If the hou&s;e be magnificent, it &s;eldom receives much benefit from an artificial production of this kind. Grandeur is rarely produced.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Seldom art</L>
<L>Can emulate that magnitude &s;ublime,</L>
<L>Which &s;preads the native lake; and failing there,</L>
<L>Her works betray their character, and name;</L>
<L>And dwindle into pools&mdash;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="188" REF="212">The mo&s;t natural inhabitants of parks are fallow deer; and very beautiful they are: but flocks of &s;heep, and herds of cattle are more u&s;eful; and, in my opinion, more beautiful. Sheep particularly are very ornamental in a park. Their colour is ju&s;t that dingy hue, which contra&s;ts with the verdure of the ground; and the flakine&s;s of their wool is rich, and picture&s;que. I &s;hould wi&s;h them however to wear their natural livery; and not to be patched with letters, and daubed over with red-ochre. To &s;ee the &s;ide of a hill &s;pread with groups of &s;heep&mdash;or to &s;ee them through openings among the boles of trees, at a little di&s;tance, with a gleam of light falling upon them, is very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>As the garden, or <HI>plea&s;ure-ground,</HI> as it is commonly called, approaches nearer to the hou&s;e, than the park, it takes of cour&s;e a higher poli&s;h. Here the lawns are &s;horn, in&s;tead of being grazed. The roughne&s;s of the road is changed into an elegant gravel walk; and knots of flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs are introduced, yet blended with clumps of fore&s;t-trees, which connect it with the park. Single trees al&s;o take their &s;tation here with
<PB N="189" REF="213">
great propriety. The &s;preading oak, or elm, are no di&s;grace to the mo&s;t ornamented &s;cene. It is the property of the&s;e noble plants to harmonize with every &s;pecies of land&s;cape. They equally become the fore&s;t, and the lawn: only here they &s;hould be beautiful in their kind; and luxuriant in their growth. Neither the &s;cathed, nor the unbalanced oak would &s;uit a poli&s;hed &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Here too, if the &s;ituation &s;uits it, the elegant temple may find a place. But it is an expen|&s;ive, a hazardous, and often a u&s;ele&s;s decoration. If more than one however be introduced in the &s;ame view, they croud the &s;cene, unle&s;s it be very exten&s;ive. More than two &s;hould in no ca&s;e be admitted. In the mo&s;t poli&s;hed land|&s;cape, unle&s;s nature, and &s;implicity lead the way, the whole will be deformed.</P>

<P>Under the term <HI>wood,</HI> we include every exten&s;ive combination of fore&s;t-trees, in <HI>a &s;tate of nature.</HI> All &s;uch combinations, tho without the privilege of fore&s;ts, compo&s;e the &s;ame kind of &s;cenery. The de&s;cription therefore of &s;uch &s;cenes will come mo&s;t properly under the head of <HI>fore&s;t-views;</HI> on which we &s;hall hereafter dwell at large. At pre&s;ent let us examine the &s;maller combinations; and fir&s;t the <HI>cop&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>cop&s;e</HI> is a &s;pecies of &s;cenery compo&s;ed commonly of fore&s;t-trees intermixed with bru&s;h-wood; which latter is periodically cut down in twelve, thirteen, or fourteen years. In its di&s;mantled &s;tate therefore, nothing can be more
<PB N="192" REF="215">
forlorn than the cop&s;e. The area is covered with bare roots, and knobs, from which the bru&s;h-wood has been cut; while the fore&s;t-trees, intermingled among them, pre&s;ent their ragged &s;tems, de&s;poiled of all their lateral branches, which the luxuriance of the &s;ur|rounding thickets had choked.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time however all this injury, which the cop&s;e hath &s;uffered, is repaired. One winter only &s;ees its di&s;grace. The next &s;ummer produces luxuriant &s;hoots; and two &s;ummers more re&s;tore it almo&s;t to perfect beauty.</P>
<P>It matters little of what &s;pecies of wood the cop&s;e is compo&s;ed, for as it &s;eldom, at be&s;t, exhibits a &s;cene of picture&s;que beauty, we rarely expect more from it, than a &s;hady &s;eque&s;tered path; which it generally furni&s;hes in great perfection. It is among the luxuries of nature, to retreat into the cool rece&s;&s;es of the full-grown cop&s;e from the &s;everity of a meridian &s;un; and to be &s;erenaded by the hum|ming in&s;ects of the &s;hade; who&s;e continuous &s;ong has a more refre&s;hing &s;ound, than the buzzing vagrant fly, which wantons in the glare of day; and, as Milton expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>&mdash;winds her &s;ultry horn.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="216">In di&s;tant land&s;cape, the cop&s;e hath &s;eldom any effect. The beauty of wood, in a di&s;tant view, ari&s;es, in &s;ome degree, from it's tuftings, which break, and inrich the lights&mdash;but chiefly from it's contra&s;t with the plain&mdash;and from the grand &s;hapes, and forms, occa&s;ioned by the retiring and advancing parts of the fore&s;t, which produce va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of light and &s;hade; and give effect to the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e beauties appear rarely in the cop&s;e. In&s;tead of that rich and tufted bed of foliage, which the di&s;tant fore&s;t exhibits, the cop&s;e pre&s;ents a meagre, and unaccommodating &s;ur|face. It is age, which gives the tree it's tufted form; and the fore&s;t, it's effect. A nur&s;ery of &s;aplings produce it not; and the cop&s;e is little more. Nor does the intermix|ture of full-grown trees a&s;&s;i&s;t the appearance. Their clumpy heads blend ill with the &s;piry tops of the juniors. Neither have they any connection with each other. The wood-man's judgment is &s;hewn in leaving the timber-trees at proper intervals, that they may neither hinder each other's growth, nor the growth of the underwood. But the wood-man does not pretend to manage his trees with a view to picture&s;que beauty; and from his manage|ment
<PB N="194" REF="217">
it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould produce a ma&s;s of light and &s;hade.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the cop&s;e forms no contra&s;t with the plain; nor pre&s;ents tho&s;e beautiful pro|jections, and rece&s;&s;es, which the &s;kirts of the fore&s;t exhibit. A cop&s;e is a plot of ground, portioned off for the purpo&s;e of nurturing wood. Of cour&s;e it mu&s;t be fenced from cattle; and the&s;e fences, which are in them|&s;elves di&s;gu&s;ting, generally form the cop&s;e into a &s;quare, a rhomboid, or &s;ome other regular figure; &s;o that we have not only a deformity; but a want al&s;o of a connecting tye between the wood and the plain. In&s;tead of a &s;oftened, undulating line, we have a har&s;h fence.</P>
<P>The be&s;t effect, which the cop&s;e produces, is on the lofty banks of a river. I have the Wye particularly in my view. In navigating &s;uch a river; the deficiences of this mode of &s;cenery, as you view it upwards from a boat, are lo&s;t; and in almo&s;t every &s;tate it has a good effect. While it inriches the bank, it's un|couth &s;hape, unle&s;s the fence is too much in view, and all it's other unplea&s;ant appearances, are concealed.</P>
<P>When a winding walk is carried through a cop&s;e, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in a cour&s;e of
<PB N="195" REF="218">
years, even in point of picture&s;que beauty, be given to the axe&mdash;&s;hall the whole be cut down together? Or &s;hall a border be left, as is &s;ometimes done, on each &s;ide of the walk?</P>
<P>This is a difficult que&s;tion; but I think all &s;hould go together. Unle&s;s the border you leave, be very broad, it will have no effect, even at pre&s;ent. You will &s;ee through it: it will appear meagre; and will certainly never unite happily with the neighbouring parts, when they begin to grow. At lea&s;t let it not &s;tand longer than two years. The re&s;t of the cop&s;e will then be growing beautiful; and the border may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, till it is replaced. But the be&s;t way certainly is, if you have courage, to cut the whole down, together. In a little time, as we ob&s;erved above, it will recover it's beauty.</P>

<P>FROM the cop&s;e we proceed to the <HI>glen.</HI> A wide, open &s;pace between hills, is called a <HI>vale.</HI> If it be of &s;maller dimen&s;ions, we call it a <HI>valley.</HI> But when this &s;pace is contracted to a <HI>cha&s;m,</HI> it becomes a <HI>glen.</HI> A glen therefore is mo&s;t commonly the offspring of a mountainous country; tho it is &s;ometimes found el&s;where, with it's common accompa|niments of woody-banks, and a rivulet at the bottom. The&s;e circum&s;tances, it is evident, admit infinite variety. The <HI>glen</HI> may be more, or le&s;s contracted. It may form one &s;ingle &s;weep; or it's deviations may be irregular. The wood may con&s;i&s;t of full-grown trees; or of underwood; or of a mixture of both. The path, which winds through it, may run along the upper part, or the lower. Or, la&s;tly, the rivulet may foam among rocks; or it may murmur
<PB N="198" REF="220">
among pebbles; or it may form tran&s;parent pools, overhung with wood; or, which is often the ca&s;e, it may be totally invi&s;ible; and an object only of the ear.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t beautiful circum&s;tances that at|tends the internal parts of a glen, are the glades, or openings, which are found in it. If the whole were a thicket, like the <HI>full-grown cop&s;e,</HI> little beauty would re&s;ult. An agreeable &s;hade alone, in that ca&s;e, mu&s;t &s;atisfy our expecta|tions. But the glen, who&s;e furniture is com|monly of more fortuitous growth, than that of the cop&s;e, and not &s;o &s;ubject to periodical defalcations, exhibits generally more beautiful &s;cenery. Particularly it abounds with frequent openings. The eye is carried down, from the higher grounds, to a &s;weep of the river&mdash;or to a little gu&s;hing ca&s;cade&mdash;or to the face of a fractured rock, garni&s;hed with hanging wood &mdash;or perhaps to a cottage, with it's &s;canty area of lawn falling to the river, on one &s;ide; and &s;heltered by a clump of oaks, on the other; while the &s;moke wreathing behind the trees, di&s;per&s;es, and lo&s;es it&s;elf, as it gains the &s;ummit of the glen. Or &s;till more beautifully perhaps the eye breaks out, at &s;ome opening, into the country; inriched with all the varieties of
<PB N="199" REF="221">
di&s;tant land&s;cape&mdash;plains, and woods melting together&mdash;a winding river&mdash;blue mountains&mdash; or perhaps &s;ome bay of the &s;ea, with a little harbour and &s;hipping.</P>
<P>As an object of di&s;tance al&s;o the woody glen has often a good effect; climbing the &s;ides of mountains, breaking their lines, and giving variety to their bleak and barren &s;ides.</P>
<P>In many places you &s;ee the glen under the hands of improvement; and when you happen to have a &s;cene of this kind near your hou&s;e, you cannot well have a more fortunate cir|cum&s;tance. But great care &s;hould be taken not to load it with ornament. Such &s;cenes admit little art. Their beauty con&s;i&s;ts in their natural wildne&s;s; and the be&s;t rule is to add little; but to be content with removing a few deformities, and ob&s;tructions. A good walk, or a path, there mu&s;t be; and the great art will con&s;i&s;t in conducting it, in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t natural way to the &s;pot, where the ca&s;cade, the rock, or any other object, which the glen exhibits, may be &s;een to the be&s;t advantage. If a &s;eat or two be thought nece&s;|&s;ary, let them be of the rude&s;t materials; and their &s;ituation no way forced. I have often &s;een &s;emi-circular areas, on the&s;e occa&s;ions,
<PB N="200" REF="222">
adapted to elegant &s;eats, which have been fixed, either where openings happened to be pre&s;en|ted, or were purpo&s;ely cut through the woods. All this is awkward, and di&s;gu&s;ting. Let no formal preparation introduce a view. A parading preface always injures a &s;tory. The eye receives more plea&s;ure from the ca&s;ual objects of it's own notice; than from objects perhaps of more real beauty, forced upon it, with parade, and o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>But tho we are aver&s;e to load the&s;e &s;weet rece&s;&s;es of nature with fal&s;e ornaments; yet if &s;uch &s;cenes make a part of the <HI>immediate environs,</HI> or <HI>plea&s;ure ground,</HI> of a hou&s;e; a proper degree of ornament will of cour&s;e be required. The walk mu&s;t be more artificial&mdash; it's borders may be &s;pread here and there, as in other decorated places, with flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs&mdash;the &s;eats may be more ele|gant; and a temple, or other building, may <HI>perhaps</HI> find a place: but &s;till the &s;ame cha&s;te &s;pirit mu&s;t regulate here, which pre&s;ides over all other improvements. To run into <HI>exce&s;s in ornament,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t obvious errors of fal&s;e ta&s;te. We frequently &s;ee the effect both of the <HI>natural &s;cene</HI> and of the <HI>artificial repre&s;entation,</HI> de&s;troyed merely by adorning.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>AS the <HI>glen</HI> is &s;ometimes found in the country we are about to de&s;cribe; it was nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;t to mention it as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of woodland &s;cenery: yet as it is not one of the common features of the country, we &s;hall dwell no longer upon it; but ha&s;ten to the <HI>open grove.</HI> The open grove is com|po&s;ed of trees ari&s;ing from a &s;mooth area; which may con&s;i&s;t either of pines, or of the deciduous race. I have &s;een beautiful groves of both. The pine-grove will always be dry, as it is the peculiar quality of its leaves to &s;uck up moi&s;ture: but in lightne&s;s, variety, and general beauty, the deciduous-grove excels. If indeed you wi&s;h to compo&s;e your grove in the gloomy &s;tile, the pine-race will be&s;t &s;erve your purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="224">The open-grove &s;eldom makes a picture&s;que appearance. In <HI>di&s;tant &s;cenery</HI> indeed it may have the effect of other woods; for the trees, of which it is formed, need not be &s;eparated from each other, as in the cop&s;e; but being well ma&s;&s;ed together, may receive beautiful effects of light.&mdash;When we <HI>enter its rece&s;&s;es,</HI> it is not &s;o well calculated to plea&s;e. There, it wants variety; and that not only from the &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;urface; but from the uni|formity of the furniture&mdash;at lea&s;t if it be an artificial &s;cene; in which the trees, having been planted in a nur&s;ery, grow all alike, with upright &s;tems. And yet a walk, upon a velvet turf, winding at plea&s;ure among the&s;e natural columns, who&s;e twi&s;ting branches at lea&s;t admit &s;ome variety, with a &s;preading canopy of foliage over the head, is plea&s;ing; and in hot weather, refre&s;hing. Sometimes we find the open-grove of <HI>natural growth.</HI> It is then more various, and irregular, and be|comes of cour&s;e, a more plea&s;ing &s;cene. And yet when woods of this kind continue, as they &s;ometimes do, in unpeopled countries, through half a province, they become tire&s;ome; and prove that it is not wood, but variety of land&s;cape, that delights the eye.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="225">Sometimes the grove, in the neighbourhood of great hou&s;es, demands a little embelli&s;hment; and as it is naturally le&s;s rude than the glen, it is therefore more patient of improvement. A &s;eat, or a temple according to the &s;ize, and &s;ituation of the place, may here be a proper ornament. But if the turf be neat (tho we do not often find it &s;o under trees) or clo&s;e grazed with &s;heep, or deer, no artificial walks are nece&s;&s;ary. If the &s;cene command no di&s;tant land&s;cape; nor any view of con&s;equence at hand, it will require in it&s;elf, a greater &s;hare of ornament. But &s;till &s;implicity mu&s;t be the leading idea.&mdash;One thing is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to compleat the idea of a grove; which is, that its boundaries &s;hould be concealed. It is intended for a &s;eque&s;tered place; and &s;hould an&s;wer that idea.</P>
<P>I remember meeting with an ornamented &s;cene of this kind, which was very plea&s;ing. The grove extended along the brow of a gentle declivity; and a&s;&s;umed from that circum&s;tance, a dark, clo&s;e, gloomy appearance, in its deeper rece&s;&s;es: tho its opening on the lawn was light, and airy, and agreeably connected with the ground. In the front of the grove &s;tood a rude temple of Pan; and the lawn being a
<PB N="204" REF="226">
neat &s;heep-walk, the whole, tho highly po|li&s;hed, was characteri&s;tic, harmonious, and beautiful.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing tranquility of groves hath ever been in high repute among the innocent, and refined part of mankind.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Groves were planted to con&s;ole at noon</L>
<L>The pen&s;ive wanderer in their &s;hades. At eve</L>
<L>The moon-beam, &s;liding &s;oftly in between</L>
<L>The &s;leeping leaves, is all the light he wants</L>
<L>For meditation&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Indeed no &s;pecies of land&s;cape is &s;o fitted for meditation. The fore&s;t attracts the attention by it's grandeur; and the park-&s;cene, by it's beauty: while the paths through cop&s;es, dells, and thickets, are too clo&s;e, devious, interrupted, and often too beautiful, to allow the mind to be at perfect re&s;t. But the uniform &s;amene&s;s of the grove leaves the eye di&s;engaged; and the feet wandering at plea&s;ure, where they are confined by no path, want little direction. The mind therefore undi&s;|turbed, has only to retire within it&s;elf. Hence the philo&s;opher, the devotee, the poet, all retreated to the&s;e quiet rece&s;&s;es; and
<Q><L>&mdash;from the world retired,</L>
<L>Conver&s;ed with angels, and immortal forms.</L></Q>
<PB N="205" REF="227">
In cla&s;&s;ic times the grove was the haunt of Gods:
<Q>&mdash;Habitarunt dii quoque &s;ylvas.</Q>
And in the days of nature, before art had introduced a kind of combination again&s;t her, man had no idea of wor&s;hipping God in <HI>a temple made with hands.</HI> The <HI>templum nemorale</HI> was the only temple he knew.
<Q><L>&mdash;In the re&s;ounding wood</L>
<L>All vocal beings hymned their equal God.</L></Q>
And to this idea indeed one of the earlie&s;t forms of the <HI>artificial temple</HI> &s;eems to have been indebted. Many learned men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a note in Bp. Warburton's edition of Pope's epi&s;t. to lord Burlington.</NOTE> have thought the Gothic arch of our cathedral-churches was an imitation of the natural grove. It ari&s;es from a lofty &s;tem; or from two or three &s;tems, if they be &s;lender; which being bound together, and &s;preading in every direc|tion, cover the whole roof with their ramifi|cation. In the clo&s;e rece&s;&s;es of the beechen-grove
<PB N="206" REF="228">
we find this idea the mo&s;t compleat. The lofty, narrow aile&mdash;the pointed arch&mdash;the clu&s;tered pillar, who&s;e parts &s;eparating without violence, diverge gradually to form the fretted roof, find there perhaps their earlie&s;t archetype.</P>
<P>Groves too were the &s;cenes of &s;uper&s;tition, as well as of religion. Here the prie&s;ts of Baal performed their prophane rites: and here the back-&s;liding I&s;raelites u&s;ed often to &s;kreen their idolatries. The &s;trong ideas of &s;uper&s;tition, which the&s;e gloomy retreats impre&s;&s;ed upon the ignorance of early ages, are finely touched by Virgil. The pa&s;&s;age I allude to, is in the eighth book; where the &s;tory of Evander is introduced. The whole country was then, as unpeopled countries commonly are, a mere fore&s;t; and as the groves, and woods pre&s;ented them&s;elves on every &s;ide, the venerable chief de&s;cribing each &s;cene to his illu&s;trious gue&s;t, annexes to it &s;ome tale of horror, or &s;ome cir|cum&s;tance of religious awe.</P>

<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered various kinds of woody &s;cenery, and traced the peculiar beauties of each; we proceed next to the <HI>fore&s;t,</HI> which in a manner comprehends them all. There are few exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, which do not contain, in &s;ome part or other, a &s;pecimen of every &s;pecies of woody-land&s;cape. The wild fore&s;t-view indeed differs e&s;&s;entially from the embelli&s;hed one; tho &s;ometimes we find even the fore&s;t-lawn in a poli&s;hed &s;tate, when browzed by deer into a fine turf, and &s;ur|rounded by &s;tately woods. <HI>Beauty</HI> however is not the characteri&s;tic of the fore&s;t. It's peculiar di&s;tinction is <HI>grandeur,</HI> and <HI>dignity.</HI> The &s;cenes we have hitherto con&s;idered, are all within the reach of art; and in fact, have all been the objects of improvement. But the fore&s;t di&s;dains all human culture. On it the
<PB N="210" REF="232">
hand of nature only is impre&s;&s;ed. The fore&s;t, like other beautiful &s;cenes, <HI>plea&s;es the eye;</HI> but it's great effect is to <HI>rou&s;e the imagination.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>fore&s;t</HI> immediately &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of a <HI>continued uninterrupted tract of woody country.</HI> But fore&s;ts in general are much more varied. They con&s;i&s;t indeed of tracts of woody country: but the&s;e tracts are, at the &s;ame time, intermixed with patches of pa&s;turage, which commonly bear the &s;ame proportion to the woods of the fore&s;t, which lawns do to the clumps of a park.&mdash;The&s;e intermingled &s;cenes of wood, and pa&s;turage, are again divid|ed from other intermixtures of the &s;ame kind, by wide heaths, which are &s;ometimes bounded by a naked line of horizon; but more fre|quently &s;kirted with wood. This intermixture of wood and pa&s;turage, with large &s;eparations of heath, give a variety to the fore&s;t, which a boundle&s;s continuance of woody &s;cenery could not exhibit: tho it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that in many fore&s;ts, and e&s;pecially in New-fore&s;t, the&s;e tracts of heathy country are often larger, than picture&s;que beauty requires.</P>
<P>Having given this <HI>general idea</HI> of the &s;pecies of country, which I mean to treat of under

<P>The fore&s;t, under the divi&s;ion of <HI>wood, pa&s;|turage,</HI> and <HI>heath,</HI> pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us, as a picture&s;que object, in a double view&mdash;as the &s;cenery of a <HI>fore-ground;</HI> and as the &s;cenery of a <HI>di&s;tance.</HI> In both views, it is equally an object of picture&s;que beauty: but as it's effects are different in each, I &s;hall endeavour to deli|neate their re&s;pective beauties.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of fore&s;t-&s;cenery, as a <HI>fore-ground,</HI> we mean the appearance, which it's woods pre&s;ent, when we approach their &s;kirts, or invade their rece&s;&s;es. Fore&s;ts, in their nature, are woods <HI>ab origine</HI>&mdash;not <HI>newly planted;</HI> but <HI>natural</HI> woods, <HI>&s;et apart</HI> for the purpo&s;es of &s;heltering, and &s;ecuring game. The trees

therefore, of which the&s;e natural woods, are compo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;t of all ages, and &s;izes, from the ancient fathers of the fore&s;t, to the &s;cion, and the &s;eedling. They grow al&s;o in that wild, di&s;ordered manner, which nature pre|&s;cribes; as the root ca&s;ually runs, which throws up the &s;cion; or as the &s;eed, or acorn, finds &s;oil, and room to e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf, and increa&s;e. But tho the richne&s;s of the &s;cenery depends greatly on this multifarious mixture, which ma&s;&s;es, and fills up all the va|rious combinations; yet the mo&s;t ancient trees of each &s;pecies are the glory of &s;ylvan land&s;cape. Young trees, tho even in di&s;tant views inferior to old, will however in that &s;ituation exhibit a better appearance, than on the &s;pot; where no fore&s;t-&s;cenery can fill the eye, without a proper a&s;&s;emblage of &s;uch trees, as have &s;een ages pa&s;s over them. The&s;e form tho&s;e bold, and rough exhibitions, in which the pride and dignity of <HI>fore&s;t-views</HI> con&s;i&s;t. We have already ob&s;erved, that the wild and rough parts of nature produce the &s;tronge&s;t effects on the imagination; and we may add, they are the only objects in land&s;cape, which plea&s;e the picture&s;que eye. Every thing trim, and &s;mooth, and neat, affects it coolly. Pro|priety

brings us to acquie&s;ce in the elegant, and well-adapted embelli&s;hments of art: but the painter, who &s;hould introduce them on canvas, would be characterized as a man void of ta&s;te; and utterly unacquainted with the objects of picture&s;que &s;election.&mdash;Such are the great materials, which we expect to find in the &s;kirts, and internal parts of the fore&s;t&mdash; trees of every kind, but particularly the olde&s;t, and roughe&s;t of each.&mdash;We examine next the <HI>mode</HI> of &s;cenery which re&s;ults from their combinations.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the glen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 198.</NOTE>, we ob&s;erved that the principal beauty of it aro&s;e from tho&s;e little openings, or glades, with which it commonly abounds. It is thus in the fore&s;t-woods. The great beauty of the&s;e <HI>clo&s;e &s;cenes</HI> ari&s;e from the openings and rece&s;&s;es, which we find among them.</P>
<P>By the&s;e I do not mean the <HI>lawns,</HI> and <HI>pa&s;turage,</HI> which I mentioned as one of the great divi&s;ions of fore&s;t-&s;cenery<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 210.</NOTE>; but merely tho&s;e little openings among the trees, which are produced by various circum&s;tances. A
<PB N="214" REF="236">
&s;andy bank, or a piece of rocky ground may prevent the contiguity of trees, and &s;o make an opening; or a tree or two may have been bla&s;ted, or have been cut down; or, what is the happie&s;t of all circum&s;tances, a winding road may run along the wood.&mdash;The &s;imple idea, which is varied through all the&s;e little rece&s;&s;es, is the exhibition of a few trees, ju&s;t &s;een behind others. The varieties of this mode of &s;cenery, &s;imple as it is, are infinite. Nature is wonderfully fertile. The invention of the painter may form a <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> more agreeable to the rules of his art, than nature commonly produces: but no invention can reach the varieties of <HI>particular objects.</HI></P>
<P>Swanewelt, and Waterlo delighted in the&s;e <HI>clo&s;e fore&s;t-&s;cenes.</HI> They penetrated their re|treats; and when they found a little opening, or rece&s;s, that plea&s;ed them, they fixed it on the &s;pot. They &s;tudied it's various forms&mdash; how the bold portuberances of an old trunk received the light, and &s;hade&mdash;how ea&s;ily the large boughs parted; and how negligently the &s;maller were interwoven&mdash;how elegantly the foliage hung; and what various &s;hapes it's little tuftings exhibited. All the&s;e things they ob&s;erved, and copied with exact attention.
<PB N="215" REF="237">
Their land&s;cape, bare of objects, and of the &s;imple&s;t compo&s;ition, had little to recommend it, but the ob&s;ervance of the minutiae of nature. The&s;e they characterized with truth; and the&s;e alone have given a value to their works. This prai&s;e however is chiefly Waterlo's.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Claude, Pou&s;in, Sal|vator, and other ma&s;ters, who exhibited nature <HI>more at large,</HI> took greater liberties. Their land&s;capes were generally carried into remote di&s;tance; and the beauty of their exten&s;ive &s;cenes depended more on <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>general effect,</HI> than on the exact re&s;emblance of <HI>particular objects.</HI></P>
<P>But the &s;cenery of the internal parts of a fore&s;t is not merely confined to trees. There is often an opportunity of introducing a little more variety. The &s;andy bank mentioned above, the piece of rocky ground, or the wind|ing road, are &s;ometimes found in fore&s;ts; and are always introduced with good effect. Some of the be&s;t of Waterlo's &s;cenes are indebted to the&s;e circum&s;tances for their beauty.</P>
<P>A pool of water too is a lucky incident. When it is &s;hrouded with trees, and reflects from it's deep, black mirror the mo&s;&s;y branches of an oak, or other objects in it's neighbour|hood,
<PB N="216" REF="238">
which have received a &s;trong touch of &s;un-&s;hine, it never fails to plea&s;e. But it mu&s;t receive it's black hue from clearne&s;s. Where a pool is the principal part of a little land&s;cape, the lea&s;t muddine&s;s, or &s;tain from clay, or filth of any kind, robs it of it's beauty.
<Q>&mdash;The green mantle of the &s;tanding pool,</Q>
as Shake&s;pear calls it, hurts the eye exceedingly from it's ambiguous texture. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nei|ther the character of land, nor of water.</P>
<P>Nor is the cottage, which is often found in the woody &s;cenes of the fore&s;t, a circum&s;tance without it's effect. In <HI>nature</HI> at lea&s;t it plea&s;es: nor only as the embelli&s;hment of a &s;cene; but as it &s;hews us a dwelling, where happine&s;s may re&s;ide, un&s;upported by wealth&mdash; as it &s;hews us a re&s;ource, where we may &s;till continue to enjoy peace, tho we &s;hould be deprived of all the favours of fortune. Yet on <HI>canvas,</HI> where the fore&s;t-view is formally introduced, the cottage is an improper deco|ration. In nature, the eye, &s;ated with a profu&s;ion of rich fore&s;t-&s;cenes, often &s;eizes even the humble&s;t circum&s;tance as an object of
<PB N="217" REF="239">
relief. But when a fore&s;t-&s;cene is <HI>&s;imply,</HI> and <HI>formally</HI> introduced, it ought to appear, like it&s;elf, with the appendages of greatne&s;s. There are &s;ea&s;ons, when a monarch may hold conver&s;e with the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects, without injuring his dignity; but it is not the &s;ea&s;on, when he is &s;eated on his throne. A fore&s;t-&s;cene, introduced in picture, is intro|duced with di&s;tinction; and calls for every appendage of grandeur to harmonize with it. The cottage offends. It &s;hould be a ca&s;tle, a bridge, an aquaduct, or &s;ome other object that &s;uits it's dignity.</P>
<P>With regard to aquaducts indeed, the Romans never &s;uffered wood to grow near them, le&s;t it's roots, or &s;eeds, &s;hould in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the crannies of the &s;tone, and injure the work. But there can be no im|propriety, at this day, in the introduction of a ruined aquaduct in a woody &s;cene; as trees of any magnitude may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have grown up, &s;ince it had fallen to decay. The &s;cenery about the celebrated ruins of Pont-du-Gard in Languedoc is woody; and the immediate environs of it have all the rich furniture, at lea&s;t they had lately, that a painter would de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="240">Be&s;ides the fore&s;t-trees, in which the dig|nity of wood-land &s;cenery con&s;i&s;ts, it is in|riched by a variety of humble plants, which filling up the inter&s;tices, ma&s;s and connect the whole. The&s;e, however rude, we only wi&s;h to remove, when they &s;traggle too far from the clumps, with which they are con|nected, and appear as &s;pots in the area, or middle &s;pace between different combinations.</P>
<P>A long catalogue might be given of the&s;e humble plants, which are &s;o u&s;eful in this harmonizing work; but it would lead me into tedious detail. The holly however &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a general mu&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 98.</NOTE>. In many &s;ituations it appears to great advantage: but particularly growing round the &s;tem, as it often does, of &s;ome noble oak, on the fore|ground; and filling up all the &s;pace, to his lower boughs. In &s;ummer it is a fine ap|pendage; and in autumn it's brilliant leaf, and &s;carlet berry make a plea&s;ing mixture with the wrinkled bark, and hoary mo&s;s, and auburn leaves of the venerable tree, which it incircles.&mdash;The haw-thorn too preforms the &s;ame office with good effect. Tho as
<PB N="219" REF="241">
a <HI>&s;ingle bu&s;h</HI> it is &s;ometimes offen&s;ive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 100.</NOTE>; yet intangled with an oak, or mixing with other trees, it may be beautiful.</P>
<P>Nor are <HI>&s;hrubs</HI> alone u&s;eful in harmonizing the fore&s;t, the larger kinds of <HI>weeds,</HI> and wild flowers have their effect in filling up the &s;maller vacances near the ground; and add to the richne&s;s of the whole. Among the&s;e, the heath, and broom, with their purple, and yellow tints; the fox-glove with it's pale-red pendent bells; the wide-&s;preading dock; and many of the thi&s;tle-tribe, are very beautiful. The hue of the furze too is plea&s;ant; but in bloom it's luxuriant yel|low is too powerful. Nothing can accompany it.</P>
<P>But among all the minuter plants, fern is the mo&s;t picture&s;que. I do not mean where it is &s;pread in quantities; but where it is &s;paringly, and judiciou&s;ly introduced. In it&s;elf it is beautiful. We admire the form of it's leaf&mdash;it's elegant mode of hanging&mdash;and it's dark-brown poli&s;hed &s;tem. As an accom|paniment al&s;o, nothing is better &s;uited to
<PB N="220" REF="242">
unite the higher plants with the ground: while it's bright-green hue in &s;ummer; and it's ocher-tint in autumn, join each &s;ea&s;on with it's corre&s;pondent tinge.</P>
<P>The poet indeed (who, with all his cant, is &s;ometimes a truant to nature,) pays, in general, very little attention to the&s;e rougher objects of beauty. <HI>His</HI> foregrounds are com|monly adorned with the livelier tints of nature;
<Q><L>&mdash; each beauteous flower;</L>
<L>Iris all hues, ro&s;es, and je&s;&s;amin,</L>
<L>Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay</L>
<L>Broidering the ground.&mdash;</L></Q>
And if he deign to &s;peak of ground embelli&s;hed with the&s;e rough picture&s;que beauties, he di&s;dainfully calls it a place, where
<Q><L>&mdash;nothing teems</L>
<L>But hateful docks, rough thi&s;tles, keck&s;ies, burs,</L>
<L>Lo&s;ing both beauty, and utility.</L></Q></P>
<P>Of all this undergrowth I know but one plant that is di&s;agreeable; and that is the bramble. We &s;ometimes &s;ee it with effect, &s;crawling along the fragments of a rock, or running among the rubbi&s;h of a ruin; tho
<PB N="221" REF="243">
even then it is a coar&s;e appendage. But as a <HI>pendent plant</HI> it has no beauty. It does not hang carele&s;&s;ly, twi&s;ting round every &s;upport, like the hop, and others of the creeping tribe, but forms one &s;tiff, unpliant curve. Nor has it any foliage to recommend it. In other pendent plants, the leaf is generally luxuriant, and hangs loo&s;ely in rich fe&s;toons: but in the &s;uckers of a bramble the leaf is har&s;h, &s;hrivelled, and di&s;coloured. In &s;hort, it is a plant, which one &s;hould almo&s;t wi&s;h to have totally exterminated from land&s;cape; it has neither beauty in it&s;elf, nor harmonizes with any thing around it; and may be characterized as the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of all vegetable reptiles.</P>
<P>But however beautiful the&s;e minuter plants, and wild flowers may be in the natural &s;cene; yet no painter would endeavour to repre&s;ent them with exactne&s;s. They are too common; too undignified; and too much below his &s;ubject. In&s;tead of gaining the character of an exact copier of nature by a nice repre&s;entation of &s;uch trifles, he would be e&s;teemed puerile, and pedantic. Fern per|haps, or dock, if his piece be large, he might conde&s;cend to imitate: but if he
<PB N="222" REF="244">
wanted a few touches of red, or blue, or yellow, to enliven, and inrich any particular &s;pot in his foreground; in&s;tead of aiming at the exact repre&s;entation of any natural plant; he will more judiciou&s;ly give the tint he wants in a few random general touches of &s;omething like nature; and leave the &s;pectator, if he plea&s;e, to find out a re&s;emblance. Botanical preci&s;ion may plea&s;e us in the flower-pieces of Van Huy&s;om; but it would be paltry and affected in the land&s;capes of Claude, or Salvator.&mdash;The fol|lowing remark I found in a work of Dr. John&s;on's; which I tran&s;cribe, not only be|cau&s;e it is judicious, and may be introduced here in place; but becau&s;e it affords a new argument to &s;hew the re&s;emblance be|tween poetry and painting. John&s;on was a critic in the former; but I never heard, that he was a judge of the latter. His opinion therefore in a point of this kind, was unbia&s;&s;ed. &mdash;"The bu&s;ine&s;s of a poet, &s;ays he, is, to examine&mdash;not the individual, but the &s;pecies &mdash;to remark general, and large appearances.

<P>The fore&s;t-lawn <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> is a mere field. It is only when adorned with the furniture of &s;urrounding woods, that it produces it's effect.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="247">The fore&s;t-heath al&s;o, when it is level, and bounded only by the horizon, has no charms for the eye. When it con&s;i&s;ts of well-mixed inequalities of ground, it gains &s;omewhat more upon us. But when it is bounded by woods in various parts, and inter&s;per&s;ed, here and there, with clumps, which gently unite it's woody boundaries with it's area, it becomes an intere&s;ting &s;cene.

<P>THE <HI>permanent</HI> beauties of a di&s;tant woody &s;cene ari&s;e fir&s;t from it's <HI>form.</HI> There is as much variety in the form of a <HI>di&s;tant wood,</HI> as in that of a &s;ingle tree. We &s;ometimes &s;ee continuous woods &s;tretching along the horizon without any break. All &s;eems of equal growth; and the &s;ummit of the wood is contained under one &s;trait line. This, except in very remote di&s;tance, is formal, heavy, and di&s;gu&s;ting. The &s;hape of di&s;tant woods is then only picture&s;que, when it is broken by a varied line. This variation is, in &s;ome degree, occa&s;ioned by the different &s;ize of trees; but as the &s;ize of trees, where the di&s;tance is great, has little effect, it is chiefly, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially occa&s;ioned by the inequalities of the ground.</P>
<P>A regular line at the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> of a long range of woody-&s;cenery, is almo&s;t as di&s;gu&s;ting as at
<PB N="230" REF="252">
the <HI>&s;ummit</HI> of it. The woods mu&s;t in &s;ome parts approach nearer the eye; and in other parts retire; forming the appearance of bays, and promontories. At lea&s;t this is the mo&s;t beautiful &s;hape, in which they appear, as they &s;ometimes do, when the di&s;tance, or the ine|qualities of the ground, do not prevent the eye from &s;eeing, the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> of the wood. As the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> is connected with the ground, it is commonly much more ob&s;cured than the <HI>&s;ummit,</HI> which ranges along the &s;ky.</P>
<P>All &s;quare, round, picked, or other formal &s;hapes in di&s;tant woods, are di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>There &s;hould not only be breaks, but contra&s;t al&s;o between the &s;everal breaks of a di&s;tant fore&s;t-&s;cene. A line <HI>regularly varied</HI> di&s;gu&s;ts as much as an unvaried one.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>permanent</HI> beauties of di&s;tant woods, may be reckoned al&s;o the various kinds of trees, of which they are often compo&s;ed. Unle&s;s the di&s;tance be great, this mixture has it's effect, in the variety it produces both in form and colour. Large bodies of fir al&s;o, and other &s;pecies of pines, have often a rich appearance in a di&s;tance among deciduous
<PB N="231" REF="253">
trees: but they mu&s;t be Scotch-&s;irs, pina&s;ters, clu&s;ter-pines, or other clump-headed trees. The &s;piry-headed race, the &s;pruce-fir, the &s;ilver-fir and the Weymouth-pine, have here too, as well as in the clump, a bad effect. Single they are &s;ometimes beautiful; or two or three of them, here and there, by way of contra&s;t, in large plantations, may be pictu|re&s;que: but I think they are never &s;o in large bodies. In general however the picture&s;que eye is little curious with regard to the kind of trees, which compo&s;e a di&s;tant &s;cene: for there are few kinds, which do not harmonize together. It matters more, in this bold &s;tile of land&s;cape, that the ma&s;&s;es of each different kind &s;hould be large. The oppo&s;ition is then &s;trongly marked; and the contra&s;t &s;triking, and beautiful. If different trees are grouped in <HI>&s;mall</HI> bodies, the effect is totally lo&s;t in di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;pecies of <HI>permanent</HI> beauty, which we take notice of in di&s;tant fore&s;t-&s;cenery, ari&s;es from <HI>works of art.</HI> We mean not the <HI>embelli&s;hments of art;</HI> but &s;uch <HI>rude works,</HI> as may almo&s;t be &s;tiled the works of nature&mdash;
<PB N="232" REF="254">
the productions of convenience, rather than of ta&s;te. We certainly fetch the mo&s;t picture&s;que objects from the grand &s;tore-hou&s;e of nature; tho we conde&s;cend to admit <HI>artificial</HI> objects al&s;o: but when they are admitted in this cla&s;s, they mu&s;t always be of the rough, rather than of the poli&s;hed kind.</P>
<P>Such objects we often meet with in the wild &s;cenes of the fore&s;t, &s;pires, towers, lodges, bridges, cattle-&s;heds, cottages, winding pales, and other things of the &s;ame kind; which have often as beautiful an effect, when &s;een at a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved they have, when &s;paringly met with in the internal parts of a fore&s;t. Only the nearer the object is, we expect it's form mu&s;t be the more pic|ture&s;que. Di&s;tance, no doubt, hides many defects; and many an object may appear well in a remove, which brought nearer, would di&s;gu&s;t the eye.</P>

The former affects chiefly the <HI>&s;ky:</HI> the latter, the <HI>earth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>weather</HI> is a fruitful &s;ource of <HI>in|cidental beauty;</HI> and there are few &s;tates of it, which do not impre&s;s &s;ome peculiar and picture&s;que character on land&s;cape, to which it gives the leading tint.&mdash;A country is chiefly affected by the weather, when it is <HI>hazy,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ty</HI>&mdash;or when the &s;ky is inve&s;ted
<PB N="234" REF="256">
with &s;ome <HI>cold tint</HI>&mdash;or when the &s;un <HI>ri&s;es</HI> &mdash;or when it <HI>&s;hines full</HI> at noon&mdash;or when it <HI>&s;ets</HI>&mdash;or la&s;tly, when the day is <HI>&s;tormy.</HI> Each of the&s;e different &s;tates of the weather admits much variation: but as it would be endle&s;s to trace the&s;e variations into detail, I &s;hall take notice only of the <HI>general effects</HI> of each; and of the&s;e merely as they affect the fore&s;t. In other works of this kind I have touched upon the&s;e &s;ources of incidental beauty, as they affect lakes, and moun|tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on the lakes of Cumberland, and High|lands of Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The calm, overca&s;t, &s;oft, day, &s;uch as the&s;e climates often produce in the beginning of autumn, hazy, mild, and undi&s;turbed, affords a beautiful medium; &s;preading over the woods a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eet, grey, tint, which is e&s;|pecially favourable to their di&s;tant appearances. The internal parts of the fore&s;t receive little advantages from this hazy medium: but the various tuftings of di&s;tant woods, are won|derfully &s;weetened by it; and many a form, and many a hue, which in the full glare of &s;un-&s;hine would be har&s;h, and di&s;cordant,
<PB N="235" REF="257">
are &s;oftened, and melted together in harmony. &mdash;We often &s;ee the effects of this mode of atmo&s;phere in various &s;pecies of land&s;cape; but it has no where a better effect, than on the woods of the fore&s;t. Nothing appears through mi&s;t more beautiful, than trees a little removed from the eye, when they are oppo&s;ed to trees at hand: for as the foliage of a tree con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of parts, the contra&s;t is very plea&s;ing between the varied &s;urface of the tree at hand, and the dead, unvaried appearance of the removed one.</P>
<P>The light-mi&s;t is only a greater degree of hazine&s;s. It's object is a <HI>nearer di&s;tance;</HI> as a <HI>remote</HI> one is totally ob&s;cured by it.&mdash; In this &s;ituation of the atmo&s;phere not only all the &s;trong tints of nature are ob&s;cured; but all the <HI>&s;maller</HI> variations of <HI>form</HI> are lo&s;t. We look only for a general ma&s;s of &s;oftened harmony; and &s;ober colouring unmarked by any &s;trength of effect. The vivid hues of autumn particularly, appear to great advan|tage through this medium.&mdash;Sometimes the&s;e mi&s;ts are partial; and if they happen to coincide with the compo&s;ition of the land&s;cape, this partiality is attended with peculiar beauty.
<PB N="236" REF="258">
I have remarked in other works of this kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on Scotland, v. ii. p. 174.</NOTE>, that when &s;ome huge promontory emerges from a &s;preading mi&s;t, which hangs over one part of it, it not only receives the advantage of <HI>contra&s;t,</HI> but it al&s;o becomes an object of <HI>double grandeur.</HI> We often &s;ee the woods of the fore&s;t al&s;o with peculiar advantage, emerging through a mi&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tile of greatne&s;s.&mdash;I have known like|wi&s;e a <HI>nearer di&s;tance, &s;trongly illumined,</HI> produce a good effect through a light drizzling &s;hower.</P>
<P>Nearly allied to mi&s;ts is another incidental appearance, that of &s;moke, which is often attended with peculiar beauty in woody &s;cenes. When we &s;ee it &s;preading in the fore&s;t glade, and forming a &s;oft blui&s;h back-ground to the trees, which intercept it; it &s;hews their foliage, and ramification to great ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o a good effect ari&s;es, when the &s;ky, under the influence of a bleak north-wind, cold and overca&s;t, is hung with blue, or purple clouds lowering over the horizon. If under that part of the atmo&s;phere the
<PB N="237" REF="259">
di&s;tant fore&s;t happens to range, it is over&s;pread with a deep blue, or a purple tint from the reflection of the clouds, and makes a very picture&s;que appearance.&mdash;And yet I &s;hould be cautious in advi&s;ing the painter to introduce it with that full &s;trength, in which he may &s;ometimes perhaps ob&s;erve it. The appear|ance of <HI>blue,</HI> and <HI>purple trees,</HI> unle&s;s in very remote di&s;tance, offends: and tho the arti&s;t may have authority from nature for his prac|tice; yet the &s;pectator, who is not ver&s;ed in &s;uch effects, may be di&s;plea&s;ed. Painting, like poetry, is intended to excite plea&s;ure: and tho the painter, with this view, &s;hould avoid &s;uch images, as are trite, and vulgar; yet he &s;hould &s;eize tho&s;e only, which are ea&s;y, and intelligible. Neither poetry, nor painting is a proper vehicle for the depths of learning. The painter therefore will do well to avoid every <HI>uncommon appearance</HI> in nature.</P>
<P>Within this caution however he will &s;pread the prevailing tint of the day over his land|&s;cape&mdash;over his <HI>whole</HI> land&s;ape. Nature tinges all <HI>her</HI> pictures in this harmonious manner. It is the greyi&s;h tint; or it is the blue; or it is the purple; or it is one of the vivid tints of illumination, red, or yellow&mdash;what|ever
<PB N="238" REF="260">
it be, it blends with <HI>all</HI> the lights and &s;hadows of the piece. This great principle of harmony which ari&s;es from the reflection of colour, (in &s;ome degree, even when the air is diaphanous,) mu&s;t be ob&s;erved by every painter, who wi&s;hes to procure an effect. His picture mu&s;t be painted from <HI>one pallet:</HI> and one key, as in mu&s;ic, mu&s;t prevail through his whole compo&s;ition. As the air however is the vehicle of all the&s;e tints, it is evident, that in di&s;tances (in which we &s;ee through a deeper medium of tinged air) they will prevail mo&s;t; and of cour&s;e, very little on foregrounds. The painter mu&s;t ob&s;erve this rule of nature by bringing his tints regularly forward; and his foregrounds he mu&s;t com|po&s;e of &s;uch colours (mute, or vivid) as accord be&s;t with the general hue of his land&s;cape. Yet &s;till he will be cautious how he &s;preads even the prevailing tint too &s;trongly. Much error hath ari&s;en from this &s;ource; and &s;ome painters under the idea of harmonizing, have given us blue, and purple pictures. I know not whether Pou&s;&s;in him&s;elf did not &s;ometimes fall into this fault. Nature's veil is always pure, and tran&s;parent: yet, tho in it&s;elf hardly di&s;coverable, it will &s;till give it's kindred
<PB N="239" REF="261">
tinge to the features, which are &s;een through it.</P>
<P>We have now con&s;idered <HI>incidental beauty</HI> as ari&s;ing from the <HI>colder</HI> modifications of the air. We u&s;e the word <HI>colder,</HI> not in a phy&s;ical, but in a picture&s;que &s;en&s;e, as productive only of <HI>&s;ober colouring,</HI> unattended with any force of effect.&mdash;We come now to a more illu&s;trious family of tints, the offspring of the &s;un. The&s;e are fertile &s;ources of <HI>incidental beauty</HI> among the woods of the fore&s;t. The characteri&s;tic of them is <HI>&s;trong effect.</HI>&mdash;Let us fir&s;t examine the incident of a <HI>ri&s;ing &s;un.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t dawn of day exhibits a beautiful ob&s;curity.&mdash;When the ea&s;t begins ju&s;t to brighten with the reflections only of effulgence; a plea&s;ing, progre&s;&s;ive light, dubious, and amu&s;ing, is thrown over the face of things. A &s;ingle ray is able to a&s;&s;i&s;t the picture&s;que eye; which, by &s;uch &s;lender aid creates a thou&s;and imaginary forms, if the &s;cene be unknown; and as the light &s;teals gradually on, is amu&s;ed by correcting it's vague ideas by the real objects. What in the confu&s;ion of twilight perhaps &s;eemed a &s;tretch of ri&s;ing
<PB N="240" REF="262">
ground, broken into various parts, becomes now va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of wood, and an extent of fore&s;t.</P>
<P>As the &s;un begins to appear above the hori|zon, another change takes place. What was before only <HI>form,</HI> being now inlightened, begins to receive <HI>effect.</HI> This effect depends on two circum&s;tances, the <HI>catching lights,</HI> which touch the &s;ummits of every object; and the <HI>mi&s;tine&s;s,</HI> in which the ri&s;ing orb is commonly inveloped.</P>
<P>The effect is often plea&s;ing, when the &s;un ri&s;es in <HI>un&s;ullied brightne&s;s,</HI> diffu&s;ing its ruddy light over the upper parts of objects, which is contra&s;ted by the deeper &s;hadows below: yet the effect is then only tran&s;cendent, when he ri&s;es, accompanied by a train of vapors, in a mi&s;ty atmo&s;phere. Among lakes, and mountains, this happy accompaniment often forms the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing vi&s;ions: and yet in the fore&s;t it is nearly as great. With what delightful effect do we &s;ometimes &s;ee the &s;un's di&s;k ju&s;t appear above a woody hill; or in Shake&s;pear's language,
<Q>&mdash;&s;tand tip-toe on the mi&s;ty mountain's top,</Q>
and dart his diverging rays through the ri&s;ing vapour. The radiance, catching the tops of
<PB N="241" REF="263">
the trees, as they hang midway upon the &s;haggy &s;teep; and touching here and there, a few other prominent objects, imperceptibly mixes its ruddy tint with the &s;urrounding mi&s;ts, &s;etting on fire, as it were, their upper parts; while their lower &s;kirts are lo&s;t in a dark ma&s;s of varied confu&s;ion; in which trees, and ground, and radiance, and ob&s;curity, are all blended together. When the eye is fortu|nate enough to catch the glowing in&s;tant, (for it is always a vani&s;hing &s;cene) it furni&s;hes an idea worth trea&s;uring among the choice&s;t appearances of nature.&mdash;Mi&s;tine&s;s alone, we have ob&s;erved, occa&s;ions a confu&s;ion in objects, which is often picture&s;que: but the glory of the vi&s;ion depends on the glowing lights, which are mingled with it.</P>
<P>Land&s;cape-painters, in general, pay too little attention to the di&s;criminations of morning, and evening. We are often at a lo&s;s to di&s;|tingui&s;h in pictures, the ri&s;ing from the &s;etting &s;un; tho their characters are very different, both in the lights, and &s;hadows. The ruddy lights indeed of the evening are more ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed: but it is not perhaps always &s;uf|ficiently ob&s;erved, that the &s;hadows of the evening are much le&s;s opaque, than tho&s;e of the morning.
<PB N="242" REF="264">
They may be brightened perhaps by the numberle&s;s rays floating in the atmo&s;phere, which are ince&s;&s;antly reverberated in every direction; and may continue in action after the &s;un is &s;et. Whereas in the morning, the rays of the preceding day having &s;ub&s;ided, no object receives any light, but from the immediate lu&s;tre of the &s;un. Whatever be|comes of the theory, the fact, I believe, is well a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The <HI>incidental beauties,</HI> which the <HI>meridian &s;un</HI> exhibits, are much fewer than tho&s;e of the <HI>ri&s;ing &s;un.</HI> In &s;ummer, when he rides high at noon, and &s;heds his <HI>perpendicular</HI> ray, all is illumination: there is no &s;hadow to balance &s;uch a glare of light; no contra&s;t to oppo&s;e it. The judicious arti&s;t therefore rarely repre&s;ents his objects under a vertical &s;un. And yet no &s;pecies of land&s;cape bears it &s;o well as the &s;cenes of the fore&s;t. The tuftings of the trees&mdash;the rece&s;&s;es among them&mdash;and the lighter foliage hanging over the darker, may all have an effect under a meridian &s;un. I &s;peak chiefly however of the <HI>internal &s;cenes</HI> of the fore&s;t, which bear &s;uch <HI>total brightne&s;s,</HI> better than any other; as in them there is generally a <HI>natural gloom</HI> to balance it. The
<PB REF="265">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="243" REF="266">
light, ob&s;tructed by clo&s;e, intervening trees, will rarely predominate. Hence the effect is often fine. A &s;trong &s;un-&s;hine &s;triking a wood, through &s;ome fortunate cha&s;m, and repo&s;ing on the tuftings of a clump, ju&s;t removed from the eye, and &s;trengthened by the deep &s;hadows of the trees behind, appears to great advantage: e&s;pecially if &s;ome noble tree, &s;tanding on the foreground in deep &s;hadow, flings athwart the &s;ky it's dark branches, here and there illumined with a &s;plendid touch of light.</P>
<P>In an <HI>open country,</HI> the mo&s;t fortunate cir|cum&s;tance, that attends a meridian &s;un, is <HI>cloudy weather;</HI> which occa&s;ions <HI>partial lights.</HI> Then it is, that the di&s;tant fore&s;t-&s;cene is &s;pread with lengthened gleams; while the other parts of the land&s;cape are in &s;hadow. The tuftings of trees are particularly adapted to catch this effect with advantage. There is a richne&s;s in them from the &s;trong oppo&s;ition of light, and &s;hade, which is wonderfully fine. A di&s;tant fore&s;t, thus illumined, wants only a foreground to make it highly pictu|re&s;que.</P>
<P>As the &s;un <HI>de&s;cends,</HI> the effect of it's illumi|nation becomes &s;tronger. It is a doubt,
<PB N="244" REF="267">
whether the ri&s;ing, or the &s;etting &s;un is more picture&s;que. The great beauty of both depends on the contra&s;t between &s;plendor, and ob&s;cu|rity. But this contra&s;t is produced by the&s;e different incidents in different ways. The grande&s;t effects of the ri&s;ing &s;un, are produced by the vapors which invelop it. The &s;etting &s;un re&s;ts it's glory on the gloom, which often accompanies it's parting rays. A depth of &s;hadow, hanging over the ea&s;tern hemi&s;phere, gives the beams of the &s;etting-&s;un &s;uch power|ful effect, that altho in fact they are by no means equal to the &s;plendor of a meridian &s;un, yet through force of contra&s;t they appear &s;uperior.</P>
<P>A di&s;tant fore&s;t-&s;cene, under this brightened gloom, is particularly rich; and glows with double &s;plendor. The verdure of the &s;ummer leaf, and the varied tints of the autumnal one, are all lighted up with the mo&s;t re&s;plendent colours.</P>
<P>The internal parts of the fore&s;t, are not &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed to catch the effects of a &s;etting-&s;un. The meridian ray, we have &s;een, may dart through the openings at the top, and produce a picture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 243.</NOTE>: but the flanks of the
<PB REF="268">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="245" REF="269">
fore&s;t are generally too well guarded again&s;t it's horizontal beams. Sometimes a rece&s;s fronting the we&s;t may receive a beautiful light, &s;preading in a lengthened gleam, amid&s;t the gloom of the woods, which &s;urround it: but this can only be had in the out-&s;kirts of the fore&s;t. Sometimes al&s;o we find in it's internal parts, tho hardly in it's deep rece&s;&s;es, &s;plendid lights, here and there, catching the foliage, which tho in nature generally too &s;cattered to produce an effect, yet if judiciou&s;ly col|lected, may be beautiful on canvas.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;ee in a woody &s;cene, coru&s;cations, like a bright &s;tar, occa&s;ioned by a &s;un-beam darting through an eyelet-hole among the leaves. Many painters, and e&s;pe|cially Rubens, have been fond of introducing this radiant &s;pot in their land&s;capes. But in painting it is one of tho&s;e trifles, which pro|duces no <HI>effect:</HI> nor can this <HI>radiance</HI> be given. In poetry indeed it may produce a plea&s;ing image. Shake&s;pear hath introduced it beautifully; where &s;peaking of the force of truth entring a guilty con&s;cience, he com|pares it to the &s;un, which
<Q><L>&mdash;fires the proud tops of the ea&s;tern pines,</L>
<L>And darts his light through every guilty hole.</L></Q>
<PB N="246" REF="270">
It is one of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which poetry may offer to the <HI>imagination;</HI> but the pencil cannot well produce to the <HI>eye;</HI> and if it could, it were better omitted; as it attracts the eye from what is more intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Under the &s;amene&s;s of Italian &s;kies the beauties of a &s;etting-&s;un are hardly known. There the radiant orb cour&s;es his way with equal &s;plendor from one end of the hemi&s;phere to the other. Nothing refracts his beam. To the vapours of gro&s;&s;er climates, we owe tho&s;e beautiful tints, which accompany his whole journey through the &s;kies; but e&s;peci|ally his parting ray.</P>
<P>Thus far the &s;ources of incidental beauty are all derived from <HI>milder &s;kies.</HI> But the turbu|lence of the atmo&s;phere is &s;till a more fruitful &s;ource of picture&s;que effect, in the fore&s;t, as in other &s;cenes. Unaided indeed by &s;un-&s;hine the &s;torm has little power. But when the force of the tempe&s;t &s;eparates the clouds into large, dark, convex forms; and the rays of the &s;un &s;tream from behind them athwart a clear horizon, if the objects corre&s;pond, a very &s;ublime picture is exhibited.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="271">No ma&s;ter was better acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances than the younger Vandervelt. In all his &s;ea-&s;torms he avails him&s;elf of them; and is remarkable for the grand ma&s;&s;es of light, and &s;hade, which he pro|duces.</P>
<P>The land-&s;torm is equally a &s;ource of beauty. When the tempe&s;t &s;cowls over the fore&s;t, as we traver&s;e it's deep rece&s;&s;es, what grandeur do the internal parts of it receive from the ca&s;ual ray darting upon them! Or when we view it as a di&s;tant object, and &s;ee the &s;torm blackening behind trees; with what wonderful effect does the &s;un, in an oppo&s;ite direction, &s;trike their tufted heads! But if that &s;un be &s;etting, while the tem|pe&s;t is brewing over the hemi&s;phere, black towards the ea&s;t&mdash;lurid&mdash;more purple&mdash;and glowing with red, as it advances towards the we&s;t&mdash;then it is, that the utmo&s;t value is given to it's <HI>effect.</HI> The ca&s;tle, the lake, or the fore&s;t-&s;cene, whether viewed in &s;hadow again&s;t the ruddy light, or illumined under the &s;torm; appear in full grandeur; and we &s;ee all that light and &s;hade in extreme contention, yet fully harmonized, can pro|duce.</P>

In a pa&s;&s;age, which I lately quoted from Virgil, an idea of this kind is very picture&s;quely, as well as poetically introduced.

<P><PB N="249" REF="273">As the&s;e great effects are certainly the mo&s;t picture&s;que of all aerial appearances, it is rather &s;urprizing, that land&s;cape-painters, in general, make &s;o little u&s;e of them. It is much more common to &s;ee land&s;cape painted under the uniform brightne&s;s of an equal light, than to &s;ee it illumined by the&s;e grand circum&s;tances of the atmo&s;phere, in which light, and &s;hade are &s;o happily combined.</P>
<P>The land&s;cape-painter &s;ays, that effects like the&s;e are uncommon; and he choo&s;es to paint nature as he generally &s;ees her.</P>
<P>The idea is good: but certainly the&s;e effects are common enough to have been often the object of <HI>every one's</HI> ob&s;ervation.

And if he &s;elect his <HI>objects;</HI> why not the <HI>mo&s;t beautiful mode of exhibiting them?</HI> The great effects of morn|ing and evening &s;uns, of mi&s;ts, and &s;torms, are not more uncommon, than natural com|binations of beautiful objects.&mdash;But the real truth &s;eems to be, that &s;uch effects are the mo&s;t difficult to manage, and require great

&s;tudy, and ob&s;ervation. The arti&s;t therefore, who paints for his bread, rather than his character (an evil attending the art, which can never be removed) choo&s;es &s;uch an ex|hibition of light, and &s;hade, as is the mo&s;t ea&s;y to him&s;elf; and may likewi&s;e be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the generality of his undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing employers. Hence we have &s;o great a number of glaring land&s;capes, which depend on nothing, but the beauty, and colouring of a few particular objects; without any attention to tho&s;e grand effects, which make land&s;cape by many degrees, the mo&s;t &s;ublime, and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It is perhaps one of the great errors in painting (as indeed it is in literary, as well as in picture&s;que compo&s;ition) to be more attentive to the fini&s;hing of <HI>parts,</HI> than to the production of a <HI>whole.</HI> Whereas the ma&s;ter's great care &s;hould be, fir&s;t to contrive a <HI>whole;</HI> and then to adapt the <HI>parts,</HI> as artificially as he can. I &s;peak of <HI>imaginary</HI> land&s;cape: when he paints a <HI>particular view,</HI> his management mu&s;t be ju&s;t the rever&s;e. He has the <HI>parts</HI> given him; and he mu&s;t form them into a <HI>whole,</HI> as he can: and this is often difficult.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="275">There is nothing however that tends &s;o much to produce a whole, as a proper di&s;|tribution of light, and &s;hade; which we be&s;t obtain, when we can pre&s;ent our land&s;cape under one of the&s;e grand effects of nature.

<P>What gives the mo&s;t grandeur to the&s;e effects is a <HI>predominancy of &s;hade;</HI> which has always more dignified ideas annexed to it, than a <HI>predominancy of light.</HI> And yet how little is this ob&s;erved? In the generality of pictures, and prints, you &s;ee the balance on the other &s;ide; and are often offended with glaring &s;pots of light, which de&s;troy the idea of a whole. The painter &s;hould examine his piece therefore with great care. He may put out one light, after another; and reviewing his work with a fre&s;h eye, may &s;till find &s;ome glaring part to era&s;e, before he venture it abroad. On this occa&s;ion he may apply with good &s;en&s;e, and form into an adage, a very non&s;en&s;ical pa&s;&s;age, (as it appears) in Shake&s;pear:
<Q>Put out the light&mdash;and then&mdash;put out the light.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="276">If the artificial repre&s;entation of <HI>every</HI> &s;ubject &s;eems rather to require a balance of &s;hade, in <HI>&s;ublime &s;ubjects</HI> it is &s;till more required.

<P>WE have now treated of the <HI>incidental beauty</HI> of fore&s;t-&s;cenery as ari&s;ing from the <HI>weather;</HI> we examine it next as ari&s;ing from the <HI>&s;ea&s;ons.</HI> Each &s;ea&s;on hath beauties peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The early &s;pring is not very favourable to the &s;tudy of land&s;cape. Nature is yet unfold|ing her&s;elf, and is in her progre&s;s only to perfection. The bloom of many trees, gay and fanta&s;tic in it's colouring, and form, may be beautiful and curious in it&s;elf; but is ill-adapted to harmonize, and unite with other objects. And yet we &s;ometimes &s;ee tints, which produce a plea&s;ing effect. The budding oak di&s;plays great variety. Among neighbour|ing oaks, the bud of one is a tender green; of another almo&s;t yellow; of a third an o&s;ier-brown, perhaps nearly inclining to red; yet
<PB N="256" REF="279">
each of the&s;e, as it opens, will probably accord harmoniou&s;ly with the tint of it's neighbour. But all trees have not the accommodating qualities of the oak: the early &s;hoots parti|cularly of ever-greens are &s;eldom in harmony with the foliage of the parent-tree.</P>
<P>As &s;ummer advances, the fore&s;t a&s;&s;umes a more determined, and connected form. The germs and leaves are all unfolded; the hue of the foliage becomes harmonious; the tuftings al&s;o of the trees are prepared as beds for ma&s;&s;es of light to re&s;t on; which the &s;pray, and the bloom of early &s;pring, unconnected, and un|formed, could not fully receive.</P>
<P>So far we have gained by the progre&s;s of the year. But the great objection to &s;ummer ari&s;es from the uniformity of it's hue. The face of nature is covered with one unvaried mantle of green: for tho the nicer eye may trace many &s;hades in this general colour; yet, on the whole, it is both too vivid, and too uniform, for the pencil.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="280">The reign of <HI>&s;ummer</HI> &s;carcely indures three months. The leaves, within that period, begin to change their hue, and give way to autumn; which pre&s;ents an appearance much more picture&s;que; and indeed the mo&s;t replete with <HI>incidental beauty</HI> of any &s;ea&s;on of the year. This is &s;o evident, that painters have cho&s;en the autumn, with almo&s;t univer&s;al predilection, as the &s;ea&s;on of land&s;cape. The leafy &s;urface of the fore&s;t is at that time, &s;o varied; and the ma&s;&s;es of foliage are yet &s;o full, that they allow the arti&s;t great latitude in producing his tints, without injuring the breadth of his lights.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;The fading, many-coloured woods,</L>
<L>Shade deepening over &s;hade, the country round</L>
<L>Imbrown; a varied umbrage, du&s;k, and dun;</L>
<L>Of every hue, from wan, declining green,</L>
<L>To &s;ooty dark&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Yet the autumn, in it's wane, is not &s;o plea&s;ing. It has too forlorn an a&s;pect. The leaves are withered; and their tufts &s;hrivelled, and &s;hapele&s;s. This remark however affects trees only at hand. The home-plantation &s;uffers, where you walk &s;o near the fading
<PB N="258" REF="281">
tree, as to &s;ee nature in decay: but at a di&s;tance the withered effect is not ea&s;ily di&s;cerned.&mdash; In the wane of autumn however there are other defects. The a&s;h, and &s;ome other trees, have de&s;erted their &s;tation in the fore&s;t: they have &s;hed their leaves, and left a cheerle&s;s blank.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the verdure of the fore&s;t is too much wa&s;ted; and the brown, and yellow tints, beautiful as they are, become too predominant: for the prevalence of the&s;e hues in autumn, fatigues the eye no le&s;s than the prevalence of green in &s;ummer. Only indeed the autumnal tints will ever be more varied. But the intermediate time is the &s;ea&s;on of picture&s;que beauty; when the greens, and the browns, and the yellows, are blended together by a variety of <HI>middle tints,</HI> which often create the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite harmony.</P>
<P>Of all the hues of autumn, tho&s;e of the oak are commonly the mo&s;t harmonious. As it's vernal tints are more varied, than tho&s;e of other trees; &s;o are it's autumnal. In an oaken wood you &s;ee every variety of green, and every variety of brown; owing either to the different expo&s;ure of the tree; it's different &s;oil; or it's different nature: but it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire into cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="282">In the beechen grove you &s;eek in vain for this variety. In the early autumn indeed you &s;ee it, when the extremities only of the tree are ju&s;t tinged with ochre: but as the year advances, the eye is generally fatigued with one deep monotony of orange; tho among all the hues of autumn, it is in it&s;elf perhaps the mo&s;t beautiful. The painter imitates it the mo&s;t happily by a touch of terra de Sienna. But the eye is palled with beauty in profu&s;ion, and calls for contra&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ame uniformity reigns, tho of a dif|ferent hue, when a&s;h, or elm prevails. No fading foliage indeed of any <HI>one</HI> kind that I know, produces harmony, except that of the oak.</P>
<P>The hues however of the <HI>di&s;tant fore&s;t,</HI> when mo&s;t di&s;cordant, are often harmonized by the intervening trees on the <HI>foreground.</HI> We can bear the glow of the di&s;tant beech-wood, when it is contra&s;ted at hand by a &s;preading oak, who&s;e foliage hath yet &s;carce lo&s;t it's &s;ummer-tint&mdash;or by an elm, or an a&s;h, who&s;e fading leaves have a&s;&s;umed a yellowi&s;h hue.</P>
<P>But after all, the autumnal fore&s;t is an in&s;trument ea&s;ily untuned. One fro&s;ty night, or parching bla&s;t, may introduce &s;ome
<PB N="260" REF="283">
&s;triking di&s;cord; tho on the other hand, it is true, by &s;oftening &s;ome di&s;cordant tint, it may as ea&s;ily introduce a harmony, which did not exi&s;t before. Here art comes to the aid of nature. The pencil fixes the &s;cene in the happy moment; and the fading tints of autumn become perennial.</P>
<P>I have known &s;ome planters endeavour, in their improvements, to range their trees in &s;uch a manner; as in the wane of the year, to receive all the beauty of autumnal colouring. The attempt is vain, unle&s;s they could &s;o command the weather as to check, or produce at plea&s;ure, tho&s;e tints, which nature hath &s;ubjected to &s;o many accidents. A general direction is all that can be given. Oak is rarely in di&s;cord; but beech and elm can as rarely be depended on. All mu&s;t be left to chance; and after the utmo&s;t that art can do, the wild fore&s;t, with it's ca&s;ual di&s;cords, and monotonies, will pre&s;ent a thou&s;and beauties, which no &s;kill of man can rival.</P>
<P>Thus the beauties of the waning year are fixed rather by the weather, than by the calendar. We often &s;ee them vani&s;h in octo|ber: and we &s;ometimes &s;ee a fine autumnal effect in the beginning of november: nay even later
<PB N="261" REF="284">
we may trace the beauties of the declining year, and
<Q><L>&mdash;catch the la&s;t &s;mile</L>
<L>Of autumn beaming o'er the yellow woods.</L></Q></P>
<P>Even when the beauty of the land&s;cape is gone, the charms of autumn may remain. After the rage of &s;ummer is abated; and before the rigours of winter are yet &s;et in, there are often days of &s;uch heavenly temperature, that every mind mu&s;t feel their effect. Thomp&s;on, to whom the beauties of nature were familiar, thus de&s;cribes a day of this kind:
<Q><L>&mdash;The morning &s;hines,</L>
<L>Serene in all it's dewy beauties bright,</L>
<L>Unfolding fair the la&s;t autumnal day.</L>
<L>O'er all the &s;oul it's &s;acred influence breaths,</L>
<L>Inflames imagination, through the brea&s;t</L>
<L>Infu&s;es every tenderne&s;s, and far</L>
<L>Beyond dim earth exalts the &s;welling thought.</L></Q>
To the picture&s;que beauties of autumn we may add, that the &s;un-&s;ets, at that &s;ea&s;on, are commonly richer, than when the days are of the &s;ame length in the &s;pring; or indeed at any other &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But the <HI>leafy fore&s;t</HI> is not &s;olely the object of <HI>incidental beauty.</HI> The picture&s;que eye finds
<PB N="262" REF="285">
great amu&s;ement even in it's wintry-&s;cenes; when it has thrown it's rich mantle a&s;ide, and appears to the common eye naked, and deformed.</P>
<P>The hazy &s;un-&s;hine of a fro&s;ty morning, is accompanied with an indi&s;tinctne&s;s peculiar to it&s;elf. The common hazine&s;s of a &s;um|mer-day &s;preads over the land&s;cape one general grey tint; and as we have had occa&s;ion to remark in different circum&s;tances, is often the &s;ource of great beauty. But the effect we are here ob&s;erving, is of a different kind. It is generally more partial&mdash;more rich&mdash;and mixing with &s;treaks of different coloured clouds, which often form behind it, produces a very plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>Great beauty al&s;o ari&s;es from the different tints of the &s;pray. The dark brown &s;pray of the birch, for in&s;tance, has a good effect, among that of a lighter tinge: and when the fore&s;t is deep, all this little bu&s;hine&s;s of ra|mification hath, in &s;ome degree, the effect of foliage.</P>
<P>The boles of trees likewi&s;e, and all their larger limbs, add a rich variety, and contra&s;t to the fore&s;t; the &s;mooth and the rough, the light and the dark, often beautifully op|po&s;ing
<PB N="263" REF="286">
each other. In winter, the <HI>&s;tem</HI> pre|dominates, as the <HI>leaf</HI> in &s;ummer. It is amu&s;ing in one &s;ea&s;on to &s;ee the branches lo&s;ing, and di&s;covering them&s;elves among the foliage; and it is amu&s;ing al&s;o, in the other, to walk through the de&s;olate fore&s;t, and &s;ee the various combinations of &s;tems&mdash; the traver&s;ing of the branches acro&s;s each other, in &s;o many beautiful directions&mdash;and the pains, which nature takes in forming a <HI>wood,</HI> as well as a <HI>&s;ingle tree</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 102.</NOTE>. She leaves no part unclo&s;ed; but pu&s;hing in the branch, or the &s;pray, as the opening allows, &s;he fills all vacant &s;pace, by uniting the heads of the trees: while every &s;tep we take, pre&s;ents us with &s;ome beautiful variety in her mode of forming the fretted roof, under which we walk.</P>
<P>In winter too the effect of ever-greens is often plea&s;ing. The holly, when it happens to be well combined, and mixed in ju&s;t proportion, makes an agreeable contra&s;t. The ivy hanging round the oak, if it be not too profu&s;e, we have already ob&s;erved, is a beau|tiful
<PB N="264" REF="287">
appendage to it's grandeur. I have &s;een &s;ome parts of the fore&s;t, where the &s;tem of almo&s;t every tree was covered with it. This indeed was not picture&s;que; but it gave the wood a very odd appearance, by exhibiting &s;o total an inver&s;ion of nature. In &s;ummer, the tops of the trees are green, and their &s;tems commonly bare. Here the tops were bare, while the &s;tems were in full leaf.</P>
<P>In a light hoar-fro&s;t, before the &s;un, and air begin to &s;hake the powder from the trees, the wintry fore&s;t is often beautiful; and almo&s;t exhibits the effect of tufted foliage.&mdash;As &s;ingle objects al&s;o, trees, under this circum|&s;tance, are curious. The black branches, who&s;e under-&s;ides are not covered with rime, often make a &s;ingular contra&s;t with the whitened &s;pray. Trees of minuter ramifi|cation and foliage, as the beech, the elm, and the fir, appear under this circum&s;tance, to mo&s;t advantage. The a&s;h, the hor&s;e-che&s;nut, and other plants of coar&s;er form, have no great beauty.&mdash;Trees al&s;o, thus covered with hoar-fro&s;t, have &s;ometimes&mdash;if not a picture&s;que&mdash;at lea&s;t an uncommon effect, when they appear again&s;t a lurid cloud;
<PB N="265" REF="288">
e&s;pecially when the &s;un &s;hines &s;trongly upon them.</P>
<P>But altho many appearances in winter are beautiful, and amu&s;ing; and &s;ome of them even picture&s;que; yet the judicious painter will rarely introduce them in land&s;cape; becau&s;e he has choice of more beautiful effects, when nature appears dre&s;&s;ed to more advan|tage.</P>
<P>Picture&s;que plea&s;ure ari&s;es from two &s;ources &mdash;from the <HI>beauty, and combination of the objects</HI> repre&s;ented; and from the <HI>exactne&s;s of the repre&s;entation.</HI> Thus we are plea&s;ed with the picture of a noble land&s;cape, the compo&s;ition of which is ju&s;t, and the lights well-di&s;po&s;ed: and yet a &s;ort of plea&s;ure ari&s;es from &s;eeing a bright table, a deal-board, or a ra&s;her of bacon naturally repre&s;ented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Deceptions of this kind u&s;ed frequently to be hung up in the exhibition-room, in London, among the works of capital arti&s;ts, where indeed they were unworthy of a place.</P>
<P>Since this pa&s;&s;age was written, I have met with the following excellent remark in one of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynold s notes on Mr. Ma&s;on's tran&s;lation of Fre&s;noy, p. 114&mdash; "Deception, which is &s;o often recommended by writers on the theory of painting, in&s;tead of advancing the art, is in reality carrying it back to it's infant &s;tate. The fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of painting were certainly nothing but mere imitations of individual objects; and when this amounted to a <HI>deception,</HI> the arti&s;t had accompli&s;hed his purpo&s;e.</P></NOTE>. But while the
<PB N="266" REF="289">
former of the&s;e is the work of genius, the latter is a mere mechanical knack. The one therefore is admired by the man of ta&s;te&mdash;the other, except for a moment, only by the ig|norant, and uninformed.</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t the ca&s;e before us. The painter, who choo&s;es a winter-&s;ubject, in ge|neral, gives up compo&s;ition, and effect, to &s;hew how naturally he can repre&s;ent &s;now, or hoar-fro&s;t. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pro|duce a good effect with the&s;e appendages of winter: they mu&s;t naturally create fal&s;e, and glaring lights; to which the painter generally makes his compo&s;ition &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ources of incidental beauty in a fore&s;t, may be mentioned, (what perhaps may appear odd) the felling of timber. If you wi&s;h to fell trees with &s;ome particular view to improvement, the intention is often fru&s;trated. It mu&s;t be done very artfully, or,
<PB N="267" REF="290">
in general, your de&s;ign will be apparent, and di&s;gu&s;ting to the eye. The ma&s;ter of the &s;cene him&s;elf, who is always on the &s;pot, and examines it frequently from every &s;tand, if he be a man of ta&s;te, will be the be&s;t improver, and direct the felling axe with mo&s;t judgment. At the &s;ame time, we fre|quently &s;ee trees cut down carele&s;&s;ly, for the purpo&s;e of utility, which have opened greater beauties, than any they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, when &s;tanding; tho the preconceived lo&s;s of them was greatly lamented. But this can only happen where trees abound.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this enumeration of the incidental beauties belonging to fore&s;t-&s;cenery, with an appendage, which we frequently &s;ee in it&mdash;that of a timber-wain, an object of the mo&s;t picture&s;que kind, e&s;pecially when drawn by oxen. Here the tree when dead, adorns again the land&s;cape, which it adorned when living. A gilded chariot is an object, which art has indu&s;triou&s;ly tricked out, and decorated. It is of a piece therefore with all &s;uch artificial objects, as are the mo&s;t unlike nature. Whereas the timber-wain is
<PB N="268" REF="291">
at lea&s;t a piece of &s;imple art; and the rude|ne&s;s of it's form, and materials, is a property, which it has in common with the works of nature.&mdash;Oxen too are more picture&s;que in them&s;elves than hor&s;es.&mdash;Much of the beauty however of this incident ari&s;es from it's being adapted to the &s;cene. A wain of timber is much more beautiful in a fore&s;t, than it would be in the &s;treets of a town.</P>
<P>Thus I have enumerated the mo&s;t common &s;ources of <HI>permanent,</HI> and <HI>incidental</HI> beauty in fore&s;t-land&s;cape. I have in&s;i&s;ted only on the mo&s;t <HI>common</HI> &s;ources. An eye, inqui&s;itive in the &s;cenes of nature, will inve&s;tigate many others.&mdash;Having detained the reader perhaps too long in this examination, I &s;hall endeavour to relieve him by a few general ob&s;ervations on <HI>fore&s;t-hi&s;tory.</HI></P>

<P>PERHAPS of all &s;pecies of land&s;cape, there is none, which &s;o univer&s;ally captivates mankind, as fore&s;t-&s;cenery: and our prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of it appears in nothing more, than in this; that the inhabitants of bleak countries, totally de&s;titute of wood, are gene|rally con&s;idered, from the natural feelings of mankind, as the objects of pity.</P>
<P>Pliny has given us a view of this kind, which, he tells us, he took him&s;elf upon the &s;pot. It repre&s;ents a bleak &s;ea-coa&s;t in Zea|land, before that country was embanked; the inhabitants of which he &s;peaks of as the mo&s;t wretched of human beings. It is true, there are other wants, be&s;ides that of &s;cenery, which enter into the idea of their wretched|ne&s;s; but I dare affirm, that if Pliny had found the &s;ame people, with all their wants
<PB N="270" REF="293">
about them, in a country richly furni&s;hed with wood, he would have &s;poken of them in dif|ferent language.&mdash;Pliny's picture is in it&s;elf &s;o good, and is likewi&s;e &s;o excellent a contra&s;t to the &s;cenes, which we have ju&s;t examined, that I think it worth in&s;erting. I &s;hall rather give the general &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, than an exact tran&s;lation of it.</P>
<P>"This coa&s;t, &s;ays he, lies &s;o much lower than the ocean, that the tides daily overflow it. The inhabitants build their huts on little eminences, which they either find, or con|&s;truct on the &s;hores; and which &s;erve to rai&s;e their dwellings ju&s;t above the water-mark. The&s;e dwellings, or rather cabins, when the tide ri&s;es, often &s;eem like floating boats: and when it retires, the inhabitants appear like &s;tranded mariners; and their cottages like wrecks. Their harve&s;t is the ebbing of the &s;ea; during which they are every where &s;een running about in que&s;t of fi&s;h; and pur&s;uing them in each little creek of the &s;hore, as the tide de&s;erts it. They have neither hor&s;e, nor cow, nor dome&s;tic animal of any kind; and as to game, they have not the lea&s;t appearance of a bu&s;h, to &s;helter it. The whole employ|ment of this wretched people is fi&s;hing. They
<PB N="271" REF="294">
make their nets of &s;ea-weed; and dry a kind &s;limy mud, for fuel. Rain-water is their only drink, which they pre&s;erve in ditches, dug before their cabins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pliny's Nat. hi&s;t. book xvi. cap. 1.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Such is Pliny's picture of this bleak, and de&s;olate country. From the very feelings of nature, we &s;hudder at it. Whereas the idea of the fore&s;t is plea&s;ing to every one. The ca&s;e is, tho there may be as much real mi&s;ery amid&s;t beautiful &s;cenery; yet beautiful &s;cenery covers it. Wretchedne&s;s is often felt under &s;plendid apparel; but it does not &s;trike us in &s;uch attire, as it does in rags.</P>
<P>That man was originally a fore&s;t-animal appears from every page of his early hi&s;tory. Trace the fir&s;t accounts of any people, and you will find them the inhabitants of woods; if woods were to be found in the countries in which they lived. Caves, thickets, and trunks of trees, were their retreats: and acorns their food; with &s;uch bea&s;ts, as they took in hunting; which afforded them only a preca|rious &s;upply.</P>
<Q><PB N="272" REF="295">

<P>If indeed they lived near a coa&s;t, like the Zealanders de&s;cribed by Pliny, they obtained a livelihood by fi&s;hing. But with the &s;avages of the coa&s;t we have nothing to do. Our attention is only engaged by the &s;avage of the woods.</P>
<P>While man continued thus an inmate of the fore&s;t, it is po&s;&s;ible he might have &s;agacity to build him&s;elf a hut of boughs, which he might cover with clods; and yet it is more probable, that while he continued the mere child of nature, he was contented with the &s;imple &s;helter, which Virgil above &s;uppo&s;es his common mother furni&s;hed; the imbowering thicket, or the hollow trunk; as &s;ummer, or winter led him to prefer an open, or a clo&s;er cover.

<P>Man in this &s;olitary &s;tate (for &s;carcity of food forbad any inlarged ideas of &s;ociety) waged but unequal war with his brother-&s;avages, the brutes. Mo&s;t of them out-&s;tripped him in &s;peed: many of them contended with him in &s;trength; and &s;ome nearly equalled him in &s;agacity.</P>
<P>The human &s;avage thus finding him&s;elf hard put to it, even to defend his own, might look round for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The dog, who&s;e friendly manners <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That there is &s;omething very harmonious between the human and canine nature, is the ob&s;ervation of all naturali&s;ts.

was probably one of his fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociates in tho&s;e countries where dogs were to be found. This union made a powerful party in the fore&s;t. The great object of it however was rather food, than conque&s;t. The dog, and his ma&s;ter were both carnivorous animals; and they &s;oon be|gan to gratify their appetites at the expence of their fellow-brutes. The one conducting, and the other executing the plan, few creatures could oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>But man, from the beginning, was an ambitious animal. Having filled his belly, he a&s;pired after dominion. For this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to procure a better ally, than that he had cho&s;en. He had yet but little connection with his fellow. To join, now and then, in a hunting-party was all the intercour&s;e he knew. It was little more than &s;uch a league as is found among wolves, jackalls, and other animals, that hunt in packs. Ideas of &s;ociety however by degrees took place. The dawnings of &s;ocial
<PB N="275" REF="298">
compact appeared. Man now threw off the brute, and thought it good to leave his &s;cat|tered tenements, and to a&s;&s;emble in hords. The rudiments of law were traced, and &s;ome rude &s;ketch of &s;ubordination. In earne&s;t he began now to &s;hew his dominion. By fel|low&s;hip he had increa&s;ed his &s;trength. The hor&s;e, the bullock, and other animals were reclaimed from the fore&s;t; &s;ome for &s;ocial a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and others for a le&s;s precarious &s;upply of food; while the &s;haggy tenants of the fore&s;t, which were ho&s;tile to his plans, began every where to give way; prowling only by night; and &s;kulking by day in &s;uch deep rece&s;&s;es, as might be&s;t &s;ecure them from the formidable a&s;&s;ocication, which had taken place.</P>
<P>But &s;till his native fore&s;t was man's delight. Here, in &s;ome opening &s;urrounded with woods, the hord fir&s;t &s;ettled. Here the fir&s;t attempts of architecture were made: the krail was laid out by rule, and line; and the fir&s;t draughts of regular defence were imagined. Cae&s;ar, with all his boa&s;ted conque&s;ts, found the Gauls, the Britons, and the Germans &s;carce emerging from this &s;tate of barbari&s;m. His commentaries every where &s;hew them to have
<PB N="276" REF="299">
been fore&s;t people; retreating before him into their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and impeding his march by felling timber in his way. The Britons, he expre&s;&s;ly tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oppidum Britanni vocant, quum &s;ylvas impeditas vallo, atque fo&s;&s;a municrunt. De Bell. Gal. Lib. v.</NOTE>, gave the name of a town to a part of a fore&s;t, which they had fortified with a rampart, and a ditch.</P>
<P>But Cae&s;ar &s;aw the Briti&s;h town only in time of war. Strabo gives us a picture of one in time of peace. "Fore&s;ts, &s;ays he, were the only towns in u&s;e among them, which were formed by cutting down a large circle of wood; and erecting huts within it, and &s;heds for cattle."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. vii. p. 292, edit. Ca&s;aub.</NOTE>&mdash;The &s;ame author, afterwards de&s;cribing a town of this kind, &s;hews more exactly the mode of fortifying it. It was the practice, he tells us, to intermix, and weave together, the branches of thorny trees, and &s;trengthen them with &s;takes.</P>
<P>As the arts of civilization increa&s;ed, man began to feel, that the fore&s;t could not afford him all the conveniences he wi&s;hed. Wants multiplied upon him; which he could not

indulge amid&s;t it's rece&s;&s;es. He cho&s;e fertile &s;ituations for tillage&mdash;the neighbourhood of rivers for mills, and manufactures&mdash;and de|&s;cended to the &s;ea-coa&s;t for commerce, which he extended to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts.</P>

<P>When man became thus refined, we leave him. When he relinqui&s;hed the fore&s;t, we have no farther connection with him. His haunts, and habits are no longer the object of conjecture. They become the &s;ubject of re|corded hi&s;tory. To the &s;age hi&s;torian therefore we now con&s;ign him; and return to the fore&s;t, which at this day in mo&s;t parts of the world, where any fore&s;ts remain, is left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the brute creation.</P>
<P>Under the burning &s;uns of Lybia, in the fore&s;ts of Zara, and Bildulgerid, the lordly lion reigns. He harbours too in the woods of India; but there he is an ignoble brute, compared with the lion of Africa. The
<PB N="278" REF="301">
African lion is a bea&s;t of unrivalled prowe&s;s. Nothing appalls him. From his dark re|ce&s;&s;es in the fore&s;t, he &s;ometimes eyes the numerous caravan, con&s;i&s;ting of men, hor&s;es, and camels, marching &s;lowly along the burning &s;ands of Barca. He la&s;hes his tail; collects his &s;trength; and bounding forward, tho &s;ingle, attacks the whole. He is received by a brigade of pointed &s;pears; and &s;oon overpowered: but in the bravery of his &s;oul, he dies without a wi&s;h to retreat.</P>
<P>In the fore&s;ts of Mallabar, and Bengal, the tyger roams. Of this animal there are various kinds; the large&s;t and fierce&s;t is called the royal-tyger. Of all the &s;avages of the fore&s;t, he is the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t in|&s;idious, and the mo&s;t cruel.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of India are inhabited al&s;o by the gentle and inoffen&s;ive elephant. This animal commonly marches in &s;ocial bands. The traveller hears them at a di&s;tance, as they traver&s;e the fore&s;t; marking their rout, by the cru&s;h, and de&s;olation of thickets, and

<P>The monkey inhabits the woods both of Africa, and India; and, what is &s;ingular, where he choo&s;es to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he may be called the lord of the fore&s;t. The lion him&s;elf gives way; not being able to bear, as travellers report, the ince&s;&s;ant tricking of that mi&s;chievous brute; who&s;e agility prevents correction. But the human figure is of all others, the object of his highe&s;t deri&s;ion. If &s;uch a phenomenon appear in his domains, the whole &s;ociety are called together by a whoop. From curio&s;ity they proceed to in|&s;olence; chattering, grinning, and throwing drown fruit, cones, withered &s;ticks, or any thing their &s;ituation furni&s;hes. Fire-arms can &s;carce repre&s;s them.&mdash;In &s;ome fore&s;ts where the ape, the baboon, and other larger &s;pecies of this di&s;gu&s;ting tribe inhabit, the traveller mu&s;t be well guarded to pa&s;s in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="303">In &s;outh-America, in the wide fore&s;ts of Brazil, and Paraguay, along the banks of the Amazon, the cougar, a &s;pecies of tyger, is the mo&s;t formidable animal. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of amphibious nature, he plunges into the river, and carries his deva&s;tations beyond that mighty &s;tream. Buffon relates, that he has been known to cro&s;s the &s;ea, in large companies, between the continent, and the i&s;land of Cayenne; and, in the infancy of that colony, to have kept it in con&s;tant alarms.</P>
<P>In north-America the moo&s;e-deer &s;eems intitled to the appellation of lord of the fore&s;t; an animal repre&s;ented by many travellers, as high as an elephant, and of a nature as gentle. With &s;tately tread he traver&s;es the va&s;t woods of fir; and crops the cones, and pine-tops beyond the reach of any other animal.&mdash;When the fore&s;t is covered with &s;now, and cru&s;ted over with fro&s;t, the wild American marks him for certain de&s;truction. His feet &s;ink deep in the faithle&s;s &s;urface; and his flight is impeded: while his pur&s;uers, mounted on
<PB N="281" REF="304">
&s;now-&s;hoes, attack and retreat at plea&s;ure; a&s;&s;ailing him with &s;hot, or arrows, on every &s;ide: and when he falls, half a town&s;hip is employed to drag him to their habitations; where the noble carca&s;e is received in triumph, and at once &s;u&s;pends the effects of famine. If food be plentiful, he is hunted for his &s;kin. But tho his nature is gentle, like many other animals, he will turn upon his pur&s;uer, if he be wounded. He fights with his fore-feet. We have a &s;tory well authenticated of a hunter, on whom a wounded moo&s;e-deer turned. He was found in the woods pounded into a jelly: his very bones were broken in pieces; and the deer, having exhau&s;ted his fury, was found lying dead be&s;ide him.</P>
<P>The woods of Germany nouri&s;h the wild boar, a bea&s;t by no means among the mo&s;t ignoble of the fore&s;t. His form, the &s;hape of his head, his &s;hort erect ears, his tu&s;ks, his thick mu&s;cular &s;houlders, adorned with bri&s;tles, and the lightne&s;s of his hind quarters, &s;o contrary to the dome&s;tic-hog, which is a round lump, are all highly picture&s;que. Such al&s;o are his colour, a gri&s;ly brown; and his

coat, covered in many parts, as well as his &s;houlders, with long, &s;weeping bri&s;tles. Nor are his gait, attitude, and motion, at all inferior to his form.&mdash;This bea&s;t, during the three fir&s;t years of his life, herds with the litter, among which he was produced. He is then called by fore&s;ters <HI>a bea&s;t of company.</HI> In his fourth year he a&s;&s;umes the title of a <HI>wild boar</HI>&mdash;ranges the fore&s;t alone &mdash;becomes royal game&mdash;and at this day fur|ni&s;hes the chief amu&s;ement of half the princes of the empire.</P>
<P>From the fore&s;ts of the Pyrennees, when winter rages, the fami&s;hed wolves ru&s;h down in troops. All the country is in arms; and the utmo&s;t vigilance and force, of men and dogs, can &s;carce repre&s;s &s;uch a torrent of inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the gloomy fore&s;ts of Lapland, where the pine is covered with black mo&s;s, the hardy rein-deer browzes. If he de&s;cend into the plain, his food differs only in hue. With the&s;e two kinds of mo&s;s, the black, and the white, the whole face of Lapland is di&s;co|loured;
<PB N="283" REF="306">
and when the diminutive native of the country &s;ees the wa&s;tes around him, abound with this &s;emi-vegetable, he ble&s;&s;es his &s;tars, and calls it luxury. His rein-deer, &s;upported by this cheerle&s;s pa&s;turage, &s;upplies him with every thing that nature wants. It gives him food&mdash;it gives him milk&mdash;it gives him cloath|ing&mdash;and carries him wrapped in fur, and &s;eated in his &s;ledge, with amazing velocity from one de&s;ert to another.</P>
<P>Thus mo&s;t of the fore&s;ts of the earth became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the brute creation.

<P>BUT tho man had de&s;erted the fore&s;t as a dwelling, and had left it to be in|habited by bea&s;ts; it &s;oon appeared, that he had no intention of giving up his right of dominion over it. In a cour&s;e of ages, as population increa&s;ed, he began to find it in his way. In one part, it occupied grounds fit for his plough; in another, for the pa&s;turage of his dome&s;tic cattle; and in &s;ome parts, it afforded &s;helter for his enemies. He &s;oon &s;hewed the bea&s;ts, they were only tenants at will. He began amain to lay about him with his axe. The fore&s;t groaned; and receded from it's ancient bounds. It is amazing, what ravages he made in his original habi|tation, through every quarter of the globe. The fable was realized: man begged of the fore&s;t a handle to his hatchet; and when he
<PB N="286" REF="308">
had obtained the boon, he u&s;ed it in felling the whole.</P>
<P>In very early days this deva&s;tation began. When Jo&s;hua divided the land of promi&s;e among the I&s;raelites, the children of Jo&s;eph made complaint, that their lot was in&s;ufficient for their numbers: "Get thee up to the wood-country, &s;aid Jo&s;hua, and cut down for thy&s;elf there, in the land of the Perizzites: the mountain &s;hall be thine; for it is a wood; and thou &s;halt cut it down; and the out-goings of it &s;hall be thine."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. xvii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>The mighty fore&s;t of Lebanon, which once found employment for eighty thou&s;and hewers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings v. 15.</NOTE>, is now dwindled to a dozen trees. The woods, which covered the i&s;land of Delos, had intirely di&s;appeared even in the time of Herodotus. In all the new peopled parts of America, it was the &s;ole employment of each colony to cut down wood; and it is a&s;toni&s;hing what deva&s;tation the woods of the&s;e countries have &s;uffered during the&s;e two la&s;t centuries. In the We&s;t-Indies the &s;ame havoc was made. In Barbadoes, which was
<PB N="287" REF="309">
once covered with wood, &s;carce a &s;ingle tree can be found. All the other We&s;t-India i&s;lands, are, more or le&s;s, in the &s;ame con|dition. To prepare the ground for &s;ugar|canes, the axe has continued to rage in them, ever &s;ince the time of their di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t-Indies, we &s;ee the &s;ame &s;cenes of de&s;olation. Wherever &s;ettlements have been made, the woods have been cut down; and indeed often unnece&s;&s;arily. In the i&s;land of Sumatra, Mr. Mar&s;den tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mar&s;den's hi&s;t. of Sumatra.</NOTE>, the inhabi|tants have no &s;ettled land for their tillage; but cut down, every year, a part of the ancient fore&s;ts of the country; and meliorate the &s;oil by the a&s;hes of the trees, which they burn upon it. "I could never, &s;ays he, behold this deva&s;tation without a &s;trong &s;entiment of regret. Perhaps the prejudices of a cla&s;&s;ical education taught me to re&s;pect tho&s;e aged trees, as the habitations of an order of &s;ylvan deities, who were now deprived of exi&s;tence. But without having recour&s;e to &s;uper&s;tition, it is not difficult to account for &s;uch feelings, at the
<PB N="288" REF="310">
fight of a venerable wood, old as the &s;oil it &s;tood on; and beautiful, beyond what the pencil can de&s;cribe, annihilated for the mere temporary u&s;e of the &s;pace it occupied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mar&s;den's hi&s;t. of Sumatra.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In part the deva&s;tation of timber has been owing, in &s;ome countries, to other cau&s;es. Among the&s;e, it is well known, what pro|digious quantities of drift-timber are, every year, wrecked on the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Greenland, Iceland, Siberia, Kam&s;katka, and other north|ern regions, brought down, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by the great rivers of Tartary, and America; and thrown by the &s;etting of the currents on tho&s;e &s;hores. In a voyage related by Purchas, we are told, that the Obi, and the Jeni&s;ca fre|quently, when the fro&s;ts break, and the &s;nows di&s;&s;olve, overflow their banks, and carry down with them va&s;t mountains of ice, which rol|ling along, through the fore&s;ts, cru&s;h down all the trees they meet with; and will &s;ome|times drive whole woods before them to the &s;ea<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Second part, b. iii. ch. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="311">On the coa&s;ts of Spain, and Portugal al&s;o, drift-timber is frequently found. At the &s;iege of Gibraltar, on the night of the 26th of december 1779 (&s;ays captain Drinkwater, in his hi&s;tory of that &s;iege) "we had a mo&s;t violent rain, with dreadful thunder, and lightening. The &s;ucceeding morning a va&s;t quantity of wood was floating under our walls. The rain had wa&s;hed it from the banks of the Palmone, and Guadaranque; and it was wafted by the wind over to our &s;ide of the bay. Fuel had long been a &s;carce article: this &s;upply was therefore con&s;idered as a miraculous in&s;tance of providence in our favour."&mdash;In the Ea&s;t-Indies we have likewi&s;e accounts of the deva&s;tation of timber from the &s;ame cau&s;e.&mdash; This cau&s;e however operates only on the banks of large rivers, or near the coa&s;ts of the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Crantz's hi&s;tory of Greenland, v. i. p. 37.&mdash;Evelin's travels through Siberia, v. ii. p. 415.&mdash;Millar's collection of Ru&s;&s;ian tran&s;act. viii. 67.&mdash;Drinkwater's &s;iege of Gibraltar, page 80.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In Italy too the &s;ame havoc has been made. In Calabria indeed are &s;till &s;ome tracts of wood; but, I believe, in few other parts.

<P>From the&s;e varied &s;cenes of deva&s;tation, the Turki&s;h dominions, I believe, are the mo&s;t exempted. The Turks venerate trees; and cheri&s;h them in all places, where the &s;oil is not ab&s;olutely required.

We may &s;uppo&s;e there|fore, what we &s;ometimes hear, is true, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t picture&s;que &s;cenery in the world may be found among the i&s;lands of the Egean; and along the &s;hores of the Darda|nells; many of which, are beautifully covered with wood.&mdash;The&s;e woods account pro|bably for an appearance, which is &s;ingular to

<P>BRITAIN, like other countries, abounded once in wood. When Ca&s;&s;ibalan, Ca|ractacus, and Boadicia, defended their country's rights, the country it&s;elf was a fortre&s;s. An exten&s;ive plain was then as uncommon, as a fore&s;t is now. Fitz-Stephen, a monk of Canterbury, in the time of Henry II, tells us, that a large fore&s;t lay round London; "in which were woody groves; in the covers whereof lurked bucks and does, wild boars, and bulls." To &s;helter bea&s;ts of the latter kind we know a fore&s;t mu&s;t be of &s;ome magnificence. The&s;e woods, contiguous even to the capital, continued clo&s;e and thick many ages afterwards. Even &s;o late as Henry VII's time we are informed by Polidore Virgil, that, "Tertia propemodum Angliae pars pecori, aut cervis, damis, capreolis (nam et ii quoque

Nothing was nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch places, to produce the future phenomenon of &s;ub|terraneous timber; but to carry the trees upon the &s;urface of the bog; which might ea&s;ily be done in dry &s;ummers. Their own weight, the ouzing of the &s;prings, and the &s;welling of the mo&s;&s;y ground would &s;oon &s;ink them; as they were generally &s;tripped of their branches, which were probably burnt. Dr. Plot, who had examined &s;ubterraneous timber with great exactne&s;s, gives good rea|&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing, it might have been bu|ried in this way merely to make way for the plough; and imagines that the Engli&s;h might begin to clear their wood-lands for tillage as early as the times of Alfred the great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plot's hi&s;t. of Oxford&s;hire, chap. 6. &s;ect. 56.</NOTE>.&mdash; Others account for the phenomenon of &s;ub|terraneous timber from the havoc made in woods by the violence of &s;torms. In mar&s;hy grounds e&s;pecially, where trees take but feeble hold, they would be mo&s;t liable to this de&s;truction.&mdash;Both this hypothe&s;is, and Dr. Plot's, may be equally true.</P>

We read of them thus appropriated, even in the times of &s;acred &s;tory.

Some of them undoubtedly belonged to private per&s;ons; but on the whole, the fore&s;ts of England were both more numerous in proportion, and more appropriated to the crown, than the fore&s;ts of Scotland. How many of the&s;e di&s;tricts exi&s;ted between the fore&s;t of Englewood in Cumberland, and New-fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire, may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed; when we are a&s;&s;ured, that in the la&s;t named county alone there were an|ciently at lea&s;t a dozen; tho we can &s;carce at this time trace above half that number.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent indeed even the ve&s;tiges of mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h fore&s;ts are obliterated.

<P><PB N="298" REF="320">The picture&s;que eye, in the mean-time, is greatly hurt with the de&s;truction of all the&s;e &s;ylvan &s;cenes.

<P>THE character of the Scotch-fore&s;t is very different from that of the Engli&s;h one. It commonly extends over a mountainous country, abounding with vallies, rocks, pre|cipices, torrents, cataracts, lakes, and all the accompaniments of the wilde&s;t, and grande&s;t &s;pecies of land&s;cape. It is chiefly compo&s;ed of pines, which give it a melancholy, gloomy a&s;pect. In &s;ome parts this gloomy tinge is varied by birch; and in other parts inlivened by the cheerful green, and brilliant berries of the mountain-a&s;h. The pine-fore&s;ts often climb precipices of very towering height; dimini&s;hing to the gazing eye, when &s;tationed at the bottom, till the loftie&s;t pines almo&s;t appear melting into air.</P>
<P>The woods, that rear them&s;elves over the &s;teeps of the Alps, and Appennines, often form
<PB N="302" REF="323">
appearances of this kind, but of a more cheer|ful ca&s;t. The following de&s;cription is a beautiful contra&s;t to the gloomy a&s;pect of a Scotch-fore&s;t; tho I fancy the poet has drawn a more woody &s;pecies of &s;cenery, than is at this time commonly to be found in Italy.</P>
<Q><L>Far to the right, where Appennine a&s;cends,</L>
<L>Bright as the &s;ummer, Italy extends.</L>
<L>Woods over woods, in gay, theatric pride,</L>
<L>Well ma&s;&s;ed, yet varied, deck the mountain's &s;ide.</L>
<L>While towering oft, amid&s;t the tufted green,</L>
<L>Some venerable ruin marks the &s;cene.</L></Q>
<P>The animals which inhabit the Scotch-fore&s;t, are the roe-buck, the eagle, and the falcon. Heretofore it was frequented by the cock of the wood, a noble bird, dre&s;&s;ed in &s;plendid plumage, of nearly the &s;ize of a turkey. He was often &s;een, amid&s;t the dark foliage of the pine, rearing his glo&s;&s;y cre&s;t, and crowing at intervals: but he is now &s;eldom found. The &s;tag al&s;o &s;ometimes &s;helters him&s;elf among the thickets of the fore&s;t: but it is the heat only of a meridian &s;un, that drives him thither. The &s;torm he values not; but continues browzing in de|fiance of it, on the &s;ide of the bleake&s;t
<PB N="303" REF="324">
mountain, on which it happens to overtake him.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h fore&s;t, (except in the northern counties, which border on Scotland) exhibits a very different &s;pecies of land&s;cape. It is commonly compo&s;ed of woodland views, in|ter&s;per&s;ed, as we have de&s;cribed them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 210.</NOTE>, with exten&s;ive heaths, and lawns. It's trees are oak, and beech; who&s;e lively green corre&s;|ponds better than the gloomy pine, with the nature of the &s;cene, which &s;eldom a&s;&s;umes the dignity of a mountain one; but generally exhibits a cheerful land&s;cape. It a&s;pires indeed to grandeur; but it's grandeur does not depend, like that of the Scotti&s;h fore&s;t, on the <HI>&s;ublimity of the objects;</HI> but on the <HI>va&s;tne&s;s of the whole</HI>&mdash; the extent of it's woods, and widene&s;s of it's plains.&mdash;In it's inhabitants al&s;o the Engli&s;h fore&s;t differs from the Scotch. In&s;tead of the &s;tag, and the roe-buck, it is frequented by cattle, and fallow-deer: and exchanges the &s;creams of the eagle and the falcon, for the crowing of phea&s;ants, and the melody of nightingales. The Scotch-fore&s;t, no doubt,
<PB N="304" REF="325">
is the &s;ublimer &s;cene; and &s;peaks to the ima|gination in a loftier language, than the Engli&s;h fore&s;t can reach. This latter indeed often rou&s;es the imagination, but &s;eldom in &s;o great a degree; being generally content with cap|tivating the eye.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery too of the Scotch-fore&s;t is better calculated to la&s;t through ages, than that of the Engli&s;h. The woods of both are almo&s;t de&s;troyed: but while the Engli&s;h-fore&s;t hath lo&s;t all it's beauty with it's oaks, and becomes only a de&s;olate wa&s;te; the rocks and the mountains, the lakes, and the torrents of the Scotch-fore&s;t, make it &s;till an intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>In Sutherland, which is the mo&s;t northern county in Scotland, are found the fore&s;ts of Derry-more, and Derry-monach.</P>
<P>In Ro&s;s&s;hire, in the di&s;trict of A&s;&s;ynt, lies the fore&s;t of Coygach: and along the confines of Loch-mari, which is one of the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive lakes in Scotland, runs another fore&s;t, which bears the name of the lake.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="326">In the county of Murray are the fore&s;ts of Abernethy, and Rothimurcha; winding along the banks of the Spey. They both belong to the family of the Grants; and make a part of the exten&s;ive demei&s;ns of ca&s;tle-Grant; which &s;tands in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In the &s;hire of Inverne&s;s are the remains of &s;everal fore&s;ts&mdash;tho&s;e of Loch-loyn, Glenmo|ri&s;ton, Strath-gla&s;s, Loch-garrie, Loch-artrig, and Kinloch-leven.</P>
<P>In the county of Bamff lies the fore&s;t of Glenmore, which belongs to the duke of Gordon; who&s;e ca&s;tle ri&s;es among the woods on the confines of it.</P>
<P>On the banks of the Dee, in the &s;outhern part of the county of Aberdeen, lies the fore&s;t of Glentaner, which belongs to Lord Aboyne; and more to the we&s;t, the fore&s;ts of Braemar, and Invercald.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="327">The former is a very romantic &s;cene; e&s;peci|ally in the ea&s;tern parts. Here we find in great perfection every &s;pecies of the wilde&s;t, and mo&s;t awful country. The beetling rock a&s;&s;umes no where a more tremendous form: nor the pine, bur&s;ting from it's fi&s;&s;ures, a more maje&s;tic &s;tation: nor does the river, in any place, threw it&s;elf into more furious contortions. This wild, and exten&s;ive fore&s;t is much frequented by game of every kind; which u&s;ed formerly, in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, to draw together a great re&s;ort of nobility and gentry, from all parts of Scotland. Their meeting had the appearance of a military expedition. They wore a uniform; and in|camped together in temporary huts. Their days were &s;pent in the chace; and their evenings in jollity. Such meetings were com|mon in Scotland, and of great antiquity. A hunting-party of this kind gave occa&s;ion to the celebrated ballad of Chevy-chace.</P>
<P>The fore&s;t of Invercald is likewi&s;e a very romantic &s;cene. The pines, which at this day, grow in &s;ome parts of it, are thought to be &s;uperior to any in Europe, both in &s;ize, and quality. Many of them attain the height of eighty, or ninety feet, and mea&s;ure
<PB N="307" REF="328">
four feet and a half in diameter. They are &s;old, even in that country, for five, or &s;ix guineas a tree. The timber, which they yield, is re&s;inous, heavy, and of a dark-red colour. Con&s;iderable quantities of it are &s;till carried into the lower parts of Scotland, in floats down the Dee, when that river hap|pens to be &s;woln with rains. The fore&s;ts of Braemar, and Invercald are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of the ancient Caledonian wood.</P>
<P>In the county of Athol is the fore&s;t of Loch-rannoc; and in that of Argyl, the fore&s;t of Loch-tulla, where Mr. Pennant tells us, he &s;aw the la&s;t pines, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be of &s;pontaneous growth in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the county of Stirling lies the fore&s;t of that name; or Torwood, as it is often called. Here the country, tho &s;till abrupt, and rough, begins to a&s;&s;ume a milder form. Here too the oak begins to mix it's chearful verdure with the dark green tint of the
<PB N="308" REF="329">
pine.&mdash;As we approach nearer the Engli&s;h border, it is probable the oak became &s;till more frequent; and occupied large tracts in tho&s;e va&s;t woods, which on better evidence than that of ballad-hi&s;tory, we believe ex|i&s;ted formerly in the wilds of Tiviot, and Cheviot.</P>
<P>As we enter England, the large county of Northumberland affords the remains only of two fore&s;ts; Rothbury in the middle of it; and Lowes on the we&s;tern &s;ide, a little to the north of the Roman wall.</P>
<P>In Cumberland we find five, Nicol, Knare|dale; We&s;twood; Inglewood; and Copeland; all now de&s;olate, and naked &s;cenes; except where &s;ome of the lands have been culti|vated.</P>
<P>The wild county of We&s;tmorland con&s;i&s;ted formerly of little be&s;ides fore&s;ts; with the appendages of lakes and mountains. Six are &s;till traced in it. On the north, lies the
<PB N="309" REF="330">
fore&s;t of Milburn; in which ri&s;es one of the loftie&s;t mountains in England, that of Cro&s;s-fell. On the we&s;t, lie the fore&s;ts of Whin|field, Martindale, and Thornthwait. Mar|tindale is bounded by the beautiful lake of Ull&s;-water; and Thornthwait by that of Broad-water. On the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this rough county lie the fore&s;ts of Stainmore, and Meller&s;tang. Stainmore is a wild &s;cene, noted only for being one of the great we&s;tern pa&s;&s;es into Scotland. At the northern extremity of it is pre&s;ented a grand piece of di&s;tant mountain &s;cenery.&mdash;On the borders of Mel|ler&s;tang &s;tand the ruins of Pendragon-ca&s;tle; the walls of which are full four yards in thickne&s;s. Pendragon-ca&s;tle gives We&s;tmor|land perhaps a better title to that celebrated hero, Uter Pendragon, than any the Wel&s;h can boa&s;t. It &s;tands upon the river Eden; and the tradition of the country is, that the noble founder propo&s;ed to draw that great &s;tream around it, like a trench. His enter|prize mi&s;carrying gave ri&s;e to the following adage, applied to the attempting of an im|po&s;&s;ibility;
<Q><L>Let Pendragon do what he can,</L>
<L>Eden runs, where Eden ran.</L></Q>
<PB N="310" REF="331">
This fore&s;t was likewi&s;e celebrated for being formerly the haunt of wild-boars; and a part of it, to this day, retains the name of Wild|boar-fell. Here al&s;o &s;tands the mountain of Mowil; from whence three of the large&s;t rivers in the north of England take their &s;ource, the Eden, the Ewer, and the Swale.</P>
<P>In the bi&s;hoprick of Durham we find only the fore&s;t of Langden, or Tee&s;dale, which latter name it a&s;&s;umes from running along the banks of the Tees. When the woods of this fore&s;t were in perfection, they mu&s;t have afforded a great variety of very picture&s;que &s;cenery. For the Tees is one of the mo&s;t romantic rivers in England; and forms many a furious eddy, and many a foaming ca&s;cade, in it's pa&s;&s;age through the fore&s;t; particularly that celebrated cataract, which, by way of emi|nence, is called the <HI>fall of the Tees.</HI></P>
<P>In Lanca&s;hire we find three fore&s;ts&mdash;Lan|ca&s;ter-fore&s;t, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the &s;ame

as Wire&s;dale&mdash;Bowland, a little to the &s;outh &mdash;and Simon's-wood, extending almo&s;t to Liverpool.</P>
<P>In the northern parts of York&s;hire lie a clu&s;|ter of &s;mall fore&s;ts&mdash;Lime&mdash;Applegarth&mdash; Swaledale&mdash;and Wen&s;eley-dale. Whether each of the&s;e had a &s;eparate juri&s;diction, or whether their rights were intermingled, would be dif|ficult at this day to a&s;certain. They mu&s;t formerly however, in their rude &s;tate, have been delightful &s;cenes. Even now they con|tain &s;ome of the mo&s;t picture&s;que country we have in England&mdash;rivers&mdash;vallies&mdash;rocks&mdash;and woods in great pro&s;u&s;ion, tho intermingled, and deformed with patches of human indu&s;try.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of York&s;hire lies the fore&s;t of Pickering, extending it&s;elf almo&s;t to Scarborough. This fore&s;t, with that of Wire&s;|dale, were royalties belonging to the duchy of Lanca&s;ter; and in the time of John of Ghent, the juri&s;diction of fore&s;t-law was maintained in both of them with &s;o much exactne&s;s, that the determinations of the courts of Lanca&s;ter, and Pickering were always

e&s;teemed &s;ufficient precedents for all the other fore&s;t courts in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood on fore&s;t-law, in various parts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the middle of York&s;hire lies the wide fore&s;t of Knare&s;borough, once a very romantic &s;cene: a little to the &s;outh lies Harewood; and on the ea&s;t lies Galtries &s;till a woody di&s;trict, extending almo&s;t to the walls of York.</P>
<P>Around Hallifax lies Hardwicke-fore&s;t, within the precincts of which Hallifax-law, as it was called, took place. It was a very &s;evere juri&s;diction, ve&s;ted in the magi&s;trates of the town, to puni&s;h cloth-&s;tealing. The offender within the &s;pace of two or three market-days, was tried, condemned, and exe|cuted. The in&s;trument of his execution was called a maiden. It was a machine, in which an axe was drawn up a con&s;iderable height between two po&s;ts, and under the pre&s;&s;ure of a heavy weight, fell rapidly on the criminal's neck. The axe is &s;till &s;hewn at Hallifax.</P>
<P>There were probably many other fore&s;ts in York&s;hire, but we can only trace with any degree of certainty the &s;ite of one more, which is Hatfield-chace: and this might likewi&s;e
<PB N="313" REF="334">
have been forgotten, had it not been for a piece of hi&s;tory belonging to it&mdash;the death of Edwin, king of Northumberland, which hap|pened in this fore&s;t, together with the de&s;truction of his army, by Penda, the pagan king of Mercia.</P>
<P>In Che&s;hire we have the fore&s;ts of Delamere, and Macclesfield. The former is an exten&s;ive di&s;trict of ground, ri&s;ing, as it approaches Che&s;ter, and pre&s;enting, at the extremity, a grand view of the flat country below, bounded by the mountains of Wales. The ca&s;tle of Bee&s;ton, &s;eated on a hill, in the &s;econd di&s;|tance, appears to great advantage in the view. In this fore&s;t, Edelfleda, a Mercian prince&s;s, founded a little town for her retirement; which obtained the title of the <HI>happy city.</HI> The &s;ite is &s;till known by the name of the <HI>chamber in the fore&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two fore&s;ts in Che&s;hire there was formerly another of larger dimen&s;ions, than either of them. It occupied, under the name of Wireall-fore&s;t, that whole penin&s;ula, which lies between the e&s;tuaries of the Mercey and the Dee.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="335">In the county of Nottingham is the cele|brated fore&s;t of Sherwood, which was formerly the frequent &s;cene of royal amu&s;ement.

Having re&s;i&s;ted them nine years with various &s;ucce&s;s, and being now pu&s;hed to extremity, he fortified him&s;elf on a hill in this fore&s;t. Tacitus tells the &s;tory at length<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Tac. annal. lib. xii. chap. 33.</NOTE>. O&s;torius led his legions again&s;t him.

<P>In the county of Stafford the fore&s;t of Need|wood &s;till affords a variety of plea&s;ing country. It is bounded by the Trent, and the Dove; and is in the neighbourhood of tho&s;e romantic &s;cenes, in which the latter of the&s;e rivers makes &s;o plea&s;ing an appendage.</P>

the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter formerly held their re&s;idence. Their ho&s;pitality, diver&s;ions, and jovial hou&s;e-keeping are not yet forgotten in the traditions of the country. One in&s;tance, called the <HI>bull-running,</HI> remains, I believe, to this day. On the 16th of augu&s;t a bull is turned loo&s;e; and is the property of tho&s;e, who &s;eize him.

<P>In the &s;outhen parts of Leice&s;ter&s;hire lies the wide fore&s;t of Charnwood; in which the park of Beaumanour, twenty miles in cir|cumference, was walled round by the lords of Beaumont; and was thought to be one of the large&s;t works of the kind in England.

In this county al&s;o we have the fore&s;t of Mal|vern, and Feckingham: the former winds among the hills, who&s;e name it bears; and and the latter is famous for it's &s;alt &s;prings, in the boiling of which it's woods have been almo&s;t exterminated.</P>
<P>More than half the county of Warwick was formerly a continued fore&s;t-&s;cene, and was known by the name of <HI>Arden;</HI> an old Briti&s;h
<PB N="318" REF="339">
word, which &s;ingnifies <HI>a wood.</HI> Whether this va&s;t di&s;trict of wood-land was divided into different juri&s;dictions, would be difficult to a&s;certain. There &s;eems at lea&s;t to have been one &s;eparate chace in it, which belonged to the ca&s;tle of Kenelworth; and, it is pro|bable, there might have been others.</P>
<P>In the county of Northampton is the large fore&s;t of Rockingham; which &s;tretches along the river Welland almo&s;t to Stamford. In this fore&s;t &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Rockingham, formerly a pile of va&s;t importance, built by William the Conqueror.&mdash;In Northampton&s;hire al&s;o there are three other fore&s;ts; Sacy, Yardly, and Whittlebury.&mdash;I have been a&s;&s;ured, that in the fir&s;t, and la&s;t of the&s;e fore&s;ts, Rock|ingham, and Whittlebury, there remains, at this day, &s;ufficient timber to build the navy of England twice over; and as canals are now forming in tho&s;e parts, it may &s;oon be no difficult matter to convey it from it's deep rece&s;&s;es to any of the king's yards. The&s;e fore&s;ts al&s;o, particularly Whittlebury, are in|fe&s;ted by the wild-cat; which the naturali&s;ts call the Briti&s;h tyger.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="340">Huntingdon takes it's name, as etymologi&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e, from being a country adapted to hunting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Camden's Huntingdon&s;hire.</NOTE>. We may imagine therefore, that in elder times, when &s;uch bea&s;ts were hunted, as required large covers, a great part of the county was fore&s;t. At pre&s;ent, tho we have the ve&s;tiges of &s;everal woods, we meet with no fore&s;t directly named, but that of Wa|bridge.</P>
<P>In Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, the fore&s;t of Dean has ever been e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t celebrated fore&s;ts in England. It is of large extent, not le&s;s than twenty miles in length; and half as many in breadth; &s;tretching, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, along the Severn; and on the north-we&s;t along the Wye; the picture&s;que &s;cenes of which latter river it greatly improves by often pre&s;enting it's woody di&s;tances. The timber in this fore&s;t was formerly more in reque&s;t, than any other timber, for the &s;ervice
<PB N="320" REF="341">
of the navy. But it is, at this time, much dimini&s;hed; owing chiefly to the neighbour|hood of &s;everal iron forges, which it has long &s;upplied with fuel. There is however &s;till more the appearance of a fore&s;t pre&s;erved here, both in the &s;cenery, and in the juri&s;|diction, than in almo&s;t any other part of England. The courts are held in a large hou&s;e, which was built for this purpo&s;e in the middle of the fore&s;t.&mdash;In the county of Glouce&s;ter al&s;o is the fore&s;t of Micklewood; on the confines of which &s;tands Berkly-ca&s;tle of celebrated antiquity.&mdash;King's-wood too is another fore&s;t in this county, which being bounded by the Avon, &s;preads it&s;elf almo&s;t to the walls of Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>In Oxford&s;hire we have only the &s;ingle fore&s;t of Which-wood.</P>
<P>In Buckingham&s;hire, we have tho&s;e of Bernwood, and Clitern. Bernwood runs along the hilly country from Ayle&s;bury almo&s;t to to Oxford. Clitern was formerly a very thick impervious wood, and noted for being
<PB N="321" REF="342">
the haunt of banditti, who long infe&s;ted the country; till a public-&s;pirited abbot of St. Alban's broke their confederacy, by bringing many of them to ju&s;tice, and de&s;troying their retreats.</P>
<P>In E&s;&s;ex are the two fore&s;ts of Epping, and Hainhault; the latter of which, it is probable, was once an appendage to the former. For Epping-fore&s;t was anciently a very exten&s;ive di&s;trict; and, under the name of the fore&s;t of E&s;&s;ex, included a great part of that county. It afterwards took the name of Waltham-fore&s;t; but Epping being a place better known, it now commonly takes that denomination.</P>
<P>Wilt&s;hire al&s;o was formerly a very woody county; and once probably almo&s;t the whole of it was a fore&s;t. Even at this day we find in it the ve&s;tiges of four fore&s;ts. Peevi&s;ham, Blakemore, Bradon, and Savernack. Bradon was a &s;cene of dreadful blood&s;hed in the year 905; when the Danes under Ethelred, in|vaded it; and &s;laughtered all the inhabitants of it's environs, among whom were a number
<PB N="322" REF="343">
of women and children, who had fled for refuge to it's rece&s;&s;es.&mdash;Savernack-fore&s;t is &s;till a woody &s;cene, and adorns a part of the road between Bath and London. It belongs to the earl of Ayle&s;bury; and is almo&s;t the only privileged fore&s;t in England in the hands of a &s;ubject, by whom in &s;trict language, a cha&s;e only is tenable. This fore&s;t is about twelve miles in circuit; and is &s;till well &s;tocked with deer, and timber.</P>
<P>In Berk&s;hire is the celebrated fore&s;t of Wind&s;or. It was formerly the property of queen Emma; and was afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by William the conquerer, who built lodges in it, and e&s;tabli&s;hed fore&s;t-law. He him&s;elf u&s;ed commonly, after the cha&s;e, to &s;leep at an abbey in the neighbourhood. There is now little &s;cenery left in any part of it. Some of the fine&s;t of the old fore&s;t-trees, &s;till remain|ing, &s;tand on the left of the road leading from the great park to Cranburn-lodge. The &s;ce|nery here, chiefly from the ornament of the trees, is beautiful.&mdash;The mo&s;t plea&s;ing part of Wind&s;or-fore&s;t, is the great park; which, tho in many places artificially, and formally,
<PB N="323" REF="344">
planted, contains great variety of ground. The improvements of duke William, of Cumberland, were magnificent, rather than in a &s;tile &s;uitable to a fore&s;t. All formalities &s;hould have been, as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoided; and the whole formed into noble lawns and woods, with views introduced, where they could be, into the country. The great avenue to Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle, tho in a &s;tile of great formality, is however in it's kind &s;o noble a piece of &s;cenery, that we &s;hould not wi&s;h to &s;ee it de&s;troyed.&mdash; Be&s;ides great numbers of red, and fallow-deer, this park was in the duke's time, much fre|quented by wild turkies; the breed of which he encouraged. It could hardly have had a more beautiful decoration. Birds are among the mo&s;t picture&s;que objects: their forms, and plumage are both picture&s;que: yet they are ge|nerally &s;o diminutive, that, beautiful as they are, they have little effect. But the turkey is both a large bird; and being gregarious, forms groups, which become objects of con&s;equence. It's &s;hape al&s;o is picture&s;que; and all it's actions. It's colour al&s;o, e&s;pecially if it be of the bright copper, varying in the &s;un-beam, is more beautiful, than the plumage of any other bird. The peacock neither in form nor
<PB N="324" REF="345">
in colour, is equal to the turkey. As this bird was reclaimed from the unbounded woods of America, where it is &s;till indigenous, it's habits continue wilder, than tho&s;e of any dome&s;tic fowl. It &s;trays widely for it's food&mdash; it flies well, con&s;idering it's apparent inactivity &mdash;and it perches, and roo&s;ts on trees. On all the&s;e accounts it is a proper inhabitant of parks.&mdash;Wind&s;or-fore&s;t is about thirty miles round&mdash;the great park fourteen&mdash;and the little park three.</P>
<P>In Middle&s;ex is the fore&s;t of Enfield. After the death of Charles I, it is &s;aid, that Cromwell divided it into farms among his veterans: but if they ever took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed at the re&s;toration; and deer, it's ancient inhabitants, were again &s;ettled in their room.</P>
<P>Surry and Kent were formerly very woody counties; of which we need no evidence, be&s;ides that of Cae&s;ar, when he invaded Bri|tain. There are no traces however of any nominal fore&s;t in either of them, except the fore&s;t of Tunbridge. Woods indeed there are
<PB N="325" REF="346">
in various parts; and much more the appea|rance of a woody country is &s;till left, than in mo&s;t of tho&s;e countries, in which fore&s;ts are known to have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Su&s;&s;ex, on the other hand, which has ever been remarkable as one of the fine&s;t timber counties in England, abounds at the &s;ame time with nominal fore&s;ts. It contains no fewer than &s;even; St. Leonard's; Word; A&s;hdown; Waterdown; Dallington; Arun|del; and Charlton; which la&s;t fore&s;t was &s;ettled on the dukes of Richmond. Ridings through it have lately been cut; and many plantations made; but I never &s;aw them.</P>
<P>In Cornwall it does not appear, that there has ever been any thing like a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>In Devon&s;hire there are two; the fore&s;t of Dartmore, which runs along the mountainous, and barren country, on both &s;ides of the river Dart, before it enters the &s;outh-Hams: and the fore&s;t of Exmore, which accompanies the river Ex, till it enter the more fertile country about Dulverton.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="347">In Somer&s;et&s;hire there are likewi&s;e two, Nerohe-fore&s;t, which lies a little to the &s;outh of Taunton; and Selwood-fore&s;t, a little to the &s;outh of Froom.&mdash;The&s;e &s;cenes will ever be famous in Briti&s;h hi&s;tory; while the remembrance continues of Alfred the great. Frequent inundations of Danes, and repeated lo&s;&s;es had driven him from the management of affairs. But he retired before the enemies of his country, only to attack them with more advantage. Seeing the time ripe for action, he emerged from his retreat; &s;ent his emi&s;|&s;aries around, and called his friends together in the fore&s;t of Selwood, which &s;heltered, and concealed his numbers. Here arranging his followers, he bur&s;t from the fore&s;t, like a torrent, upon the Danes. They gave way at once; and &s;uffered &s;o terrible a defeat, that they never again mole&s;ted his repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the north of Dor&s;et&s;hire lies Gilling|ham-fore&s;t, remarkable al&s;o for a great defeat, which Edmond Iron&s;ide gave the Danes, on the confines of it. A little to the ea&s;t lies
<PB N="327" REF="348">
Cranburn-cha&s;e; and on the we&s;t, Black|more-fore&s;t, commonly called the fore&s;t of White-hart; from a celebrated &s;tag, which afforded great diver&s;ion to Henry III.&mdash;The whole of the i&s;land of Purbeck was once a fore&s;t. In the mid&s;t of it &s;tands Corf-ca&s;tle; where El&s;rida, to open the throne for her &s;on Ethelred, murdered her &s;on-in-law Edward; when he called for refre&s;hment at her ca&s;tle after a toil&s;ome cha&s;e.</P>
<P>In Hamp&s;hire are the ve&s;tiges of five fore&s;ts. On the north near Sylche&s;ter lies Chute-fore&s;t; through which pa&s;&s;es the great &s;outhern Roman road, &s;till vi&s;ible in many parts. On the we&s;t lies the fore&s;t of Harewood, which is &s;till a woody &s;cene, tho it's larger trees are in general gone. This place was formerly celebratad for the unfortunate loves of Athel|wold, and Elfrida. Here Edgar &s;lew his rival; and the &s;uppo&s;ed place is traditionally marked by the name of dead-man's plot. The abbey of Whorwell, which Elfrida founded on this occa&s;ion, is not now to be traced, except by a monumental &s;tone, which marks it's &s;ituation. On the ea&s;t of Hamp&s;hire,
<PB N="328" REF="349">
lies Holt-fore&s;t: more to the &s;outh, the fore&s;t of Waltham, which belongs to the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter: and near Tichfield, the fore&s;t of Bere. Some parts of the&s;e fore&s;ts &s;till afford remains of woody &s;cenery.</P>
<P>At the &s;outh-we&s;t extremity of Hamp&s;hire lies New-fore&s;t; which, as it hath given occa&s;ion to the&s;e remarks, and is be&s;ides the noble&s;t &s;cene of the kind in England, I &s;hall, in the following book, con&s;ider more at large; and endeavour to illu&s;trate by it's &s;cenes, &s;ome of the ob&s;ervations, which have already been made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this account of the fore&s;ts of England, I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin, that Mr. St. John (&s;ee his ob&s;ervations on the land-revenues of the crown, p. 118.) enumerates &s;eventy-&s;even; of which Wind&s;or, Waltham, Dean, Rockingham, Whittle|wood, Salcey, Sherwood, Which wood, New-fore&s;t, Bere, and Walmer, are the only fore&s;ts, he &s;ays, which are reputed to have pre&s;erved their rights. Of the re&s;t indeed he gives the names, many of which I meet with no where, but in his catalogue. He &s;ays however that &s;everal of them, were di&s;|fore&s;ted; and changed into private property, by an act of Charles I. which was wre&s;ted from him, in con&s;equence of his having revived the vexations of fore&s;t-law, at the beginning of his difficulties.</NOTE>.</P>
