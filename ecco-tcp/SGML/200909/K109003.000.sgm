<HEAD>ON THE AMUSEMENTS OF CLERGYMEN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN Dr. Jo&s;iah Frampton's library was &s;old in London (in the year <HI>1729</HI> or <HI>1730</HI>) his divinity books were cla&s;&s;ed in &s;even lots; one of which was pur|cha&s;ed by Dr. Edwards. The catalogue of this lot mentioned a parcel of MSS. Among the&s;e the Doctor found one in Dr. Frampton's own hand-writing, of which the following is a copy.</HI></P>

<P>I ALWAYS thought it one of the mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tances of my life (or rather the mo&s;t providen|tial, as I ought to call it) that &s;oon after my leaving college, I was led by various, and &s;ingular accidents, to the curacy of Wroxal in Warwick&s;hire. Here I met with many civilities from the gentlemen of the country, parti|cularly from Sir Roger Burgoin, who was equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for his piety, and learning. At his hou&s;e I fre|quently &s;aw that truly venerable man, Dr. Edward Stillingfleet, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, but at that time Dean of Paul's. He had been
<PB N="3" REF="5">
early connected with the Burgoin fa|mily, and ever pre&s;erved a great inti|macy with them; which he commonly renewed, every year, by a vi&s;it of two or three weeks.</P>
<P>What Dr. Stillingfleet &s;aw in me, I know not: but I thought my&s;elf very unworthy of the civilities he &s;hewed me. I was certainly, at that time, a very incorrect young man. I had entered into the mini&s;try with little attention to the duties, I had taken on me to di&s;charge. I loved &s;ociety, and was fond of country di|ver&s;ions: and though I was fond al&s;o of my book, I would at any time have
<PB N="4" REF="6">
left it for a day's diver&s;ion with the hounds&mdash;a ramble in the woods with my gun&mdash;or a game of cards, and a dance in the evening. Such as I was however Dr. Stillingfleet was particu|larly obliging to me; and friendly enough to give me a hint, now and then, with regard to my conduct, which, I hope I may with truth &s;ay, was not lo&s;t upon me.&mdash;An opportu|nity however occurred, which ena|bled me to receive more than <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> advantage from his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>During one of his annual vi&s;its to the Burgoin family, he was &s;eized with a violent fit of the gout, to which
<PB N="5" REF="7">
his latter years were very &s;ubject. It happened at this critical time, that Sir Roger Burgoin and his lady were called into Worce&s;ter&s;hire to attend their mother, who lay at the point of death: and as the Dean expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire for my company, in their ab|&s;ence, I gave him as much of it, as I could; following not more his de&s;ire, than my own inclination. He was at that time engaged in correcting his <HI>Origines Sacrae</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very learned work was written, when Stillingfleet was under thirty years of age. A &s;tory is told of his having been put to the blu&s;h by Bi&s;hop Saunder&s;on, his dioce&s;an; who &s;eeing a young man at his vi&s;itation, of the name of Stillingfleet, and not knowing his per&s;on, a&s;ked him, whether he were related to the great Stillingfleet, who wrote the <HI>Origines Sacrae?</HI></NOTE> for a new edition; and had
<PB N="6" REF="8">
brought down with him &s;everal Latin books to con&s;ult. As I could read that language with accuracy enough, I was of &s;ome little u&s;e to him. While I read, he noted with his pen the pa&s;&s;ages he wanted. The inter|vals were filled with conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>We were &s;itting together, one day, after dinner; and the Dean lay|ing up his feet on a cu&s;hion, and being tolerably free from pain, began
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to rally me a little on my attachment to country diver&s;ions&mdash;a &s;ubject he had often before ca&s;ually introduced; and on which he knew I had a weak &s;ide. I had brought him two young partridges that day for his dinner; and he began by expre&s;&s;ing his obli|gations to me for my attention to him; and then a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;|tion, which led me to give him an account of my day's exploits. I did not &s;ee his drift; and in the &s;pirit of a &s;port&s;man, told him, that the late rainy &s;ea&s;on had made game very &s;carce&mdash;that the two covies, from which I had &s;hot the brace I had brought to him, were the only birds
<PB N="8" REF="10">
I had &s;een the whole day, though I had been out from five in the morn|ing till twelve at noon; and had walked upwards of fifteen miles.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid the Dean, with an affected gravity of countenance, I only wi&s;hed to know the extent of my obligation to you; and I find your philanthropy has done more for me in giving me &s;even hours of your time to procure me a dinner, than I could have done, (even were I as able to walk as you are) for any man in Chri&s;ten|dom.</P>
<P>From being a little jocular, he
<PB N="9" REF="11">
became, by degrees, &s;erious. I have often thought, &s;aid he, Mr. Frampton, (and I know your candor will excu&s;e me) that the clergy have rather in|jured the re&s;pectability of their cha|racters by mixing too much with the amu&s;ements of laymen. They not only get into a trifling way of &s;pend|ing their time; but by making them|&s;elves cheap, they dimini&s;h the weight of their in&s;tructions; and often give a &s;ort of &s;anction by their pre&s;ence to gaieties, which were better checked. It is a common &s;peech in the mouths of licentious people, that they mu&s;t be right, becau&s;e they have gotten the par|&s;on along with them.&mdash;Indeed a cler|gyman cannot be too cautious with re|gard
<PB N="10" REF="12">
to his character. It is a matter of the greate&s;t delicacy, and ea&s;ily &s;ullied. If he act contrary to it, he always has a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s about him, which makes him jealous of every eye: and when he becomes hardened, he is among the mo&s;t contemptible of mankind.&mdash;You will ea&s;ily however under&s;tand, that when I re&s;trict the clergyman from joining too freely with the amu&s;ements of the laity, I am equally hurt with every appear|ance of haughtine&s;s, and moro&s;ene&s;s. If the character of the clergyman is not marked with mode&s;ty, and humility, it is bereft of its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed graces.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">But, &s;aid I, Sir, may not exam|ple work the other way; and the pre|&s;ence of a grave clergyman be a check upon licentiou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>Sometimes, &s;aid he, it may: and when a clergyman mixes in improper company <HI>with this view,</HI> and is con|&s;cious of his own powers of control, he imitates that bright example, which &s;orted with <HI>publicans, and &s;in|ners.</HI> A very re&s;pectable clergyman, a friend of mine, having heard that a favourite youth had been decoyed by bad company into a di&s;reputable hou&s;e, went thither him&s;elf; and pre|tending bu&s;ine&s;s with the young man,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
&s;at down on a &s;light invitation, among a &s;et of debauchees; tru&s;ting his cha|racter to its credit. He was a man of &s;evere a&s;pect, &s;trong &s;en&s;e, and ready expre&s;&s;ion; and therefore well fitted for the office he undertook. For awhile he overawed, by the &s;ud|denne&s;s of his appearance, the vice and folly he was mixed with. But well knowing, that in a little time the impre&s;&s;ion he made, would go off, and he might be liable to affronts, he re|tired, before the company could rally their impudence; and carried off with him his young friend; who would frequently declare afterwards, that he believed this very circum&s;tance
<PB N="13" REF="15">
brought him more to recollection, than any event of his life; and per|haps &s;aved him from ruin.&mdash;But now, my dear Sir, though I have accommo|dated your argument with an exam|ple, I mu&s;t add, that I think the ac|commodation gives it little &s;upport. I fear the <HI>motive exemplified here</HI> has little weight in the common inter|cour&s;e between the clergy, and laity.</P>
<P>But may not this intercourse, &s;aid I, Sir, though without any <HI>direct view</HI> of leading out of <HI>immediate mi&s;chief,</HI> &s;till have its u&s;e? Even the pre&s;ence of a re&s;pectable clergyman, I &s;hould think, might often be a happy re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">Why, yes, an&s;wered the Dean; but then, my good friend, you will con&s;i|der, that a <HI>young</HI> clergyman can rarely act this part. Years are nece&s;&s;ary to give re&s;pectability to <HI>this mode</HI> of in|&s;tructive intercour&s;e. Natural talents too, which few people po&s;&s;e&s;s, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary. A man of moro&s;e character may perhaps be of &s;ervice with his pen in his clo&s;et; but, however pious, and well-meaning, he will hardly be of much u&s;e in any of the &s;cenes of common life. If again, we avoid moro&s;ene&s;s by a&s;&s;uming the colour of our company (which mu&s;t, in a degree; always be done, when we wi&s;h to re|form in this way), I fear, in&s;tead of doing good, we &s;hall do harm.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">But it is a difficult matter, &s;aid I, Sir, e&s;pecially for a young man, to pre&s;erve tho&s;e exact bounds of inter|cour&s;e, which his character may re|quire. When he enters fir&s;t into the world, and is taken notice of by tho&s;e, who are in a &s;tation above him, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for him to re&s;i&s;t the importunities he meets with to enter into various amu&s;ements; to drink his gla&s;s freely; or make one in par|ties, which in fact perhaps he may not approve.</P>
<P>No doubt, &s;aid the Dean, it may be difficult. But do you believe that when God placed you in a &s;tate of
<PB N="16" REF="18">
trial, he meant that you &s;hould live without difficulties? The whole of life is a conflict: and if we do not begin early to brace on our moral armour, and accu&s;tom our&s;elves to it, when are we to enter the field?&mdash;I &s;hould hope it is for want of con&s;ide|ration, more than any thing el&s;e, that &s;o many young clergymen err in this matter. I could wi&s;h them to fix in their own minds certain bounds to their amu&s;ements, and remember the poet's caution,
<Q>Quos ultra, citraque, nequit con&s;i&s;tere rectum.</Q></P>
<P>Aye, Sir, &s;aid I, the&s;e <HI>certi fines</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="19">
this narrow path between the <HI>citra,</HI> and the <HI>ultra,</HI> I have often in vain en|deavoured to pur&s;ue. And if you can give me any in&s;truction to guide my foot&s;teps better through the amu&s;e|ments of life, than they have hitherto been conducted, I &s;hall kindly receive them, and lay them up in a grateful memory.</P>
<P>It is very probable, my dear Sir, &s;aid the Dean, that my rules may be &s;tricter, than you would wi&s;h to comply with. I have thought often on the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ject lately for the &s;ake of a young clergyman, in who&s;e well-doing I was
<PB N="18" REF="20">
much intere&s;ted: but I had not all the &s;ucce&s;s I hoped for.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured the Dean, I &s;hould endea|vour to be a more ob&s;ervant di&s;ciple. I did indeed &s;pend a con&s;iderable part of my time in amu&s;ements of various kinds; but I was hopeful, that my errors proceeded more from inatten|tion (the apology he was plea&s;ed to furni&s;h) than from any bad di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>The good Dean was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he believed me; and added &s;ome other friendly expre&s;&s;ions, which not
<PB N="19" REF="21">
being to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I omit. He then a&s;ked me, what was my idea of an amu&s;ement; or how I &s;hould define it?</P>
<P>This was a puzzling que&s;tion to one, who had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed &s;o much on this head; and who having never thought much on the &s;ubject, &s;eldom had any end, but barely to plea&s;e him|&s;elf. I <HI>could</HI> have given him a defini|tion of amu&s;ement; but I was afraid of bringing my own practice too much within its cen&s;ure. To gain therefore a little time for reflection, I a&s;ked, Whether he meant <HI>amu&s;ement
<PB N="20" REF="22">
in general,</HI> or confined the que&s;tion to the <HI>amu&s;ements of clergymen?</HI></P>
<P>Why, truly, &s;aid the Dean, the amu&s;ements of all people require re|gulation enough. But my que&s;tion, at pre&s;ent, relates only to the <HI>amu&s;e|ments of the clergy.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that I thought <HI>bodily exerci&s;e</HI> was one end; and as to the <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> of the mind, I thought its only end was to relax, and fit it the better for &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Your definition, &s;aid the Dean, is
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;o far good: but it does not go far enough. It con&s;iders only the <HI>pur|po&s;e</HI> of amu&s;ement: whereas it &s;hould al&s;o take in the <HI>quality.</HI> You will allow, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the clerical amu&s;ement &s;hould be &s;uited to the clerical profe&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>I allowed it certainly.</P>
<P>Well, then, &s;aid the Dean, we have now, I think, obtained a full definition of <HI>clerical amu&s;ement.</HI> It &s;hould intend the <HI>exerci&s;e of the body, and the recrea|tion of the mind;</HI> but it &s;hould al&s;o be <HI>&s;uited to the genius of the profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> As the fir&s;t member however of this de|finition
<PB N="22" REF="24">
relates to amu&s;ement in gene|ral; and applies as well <HI>ad populum,</HI> as <HI>ad clerum,</HI> we will, if you plea&s;e, pa&s;s it over at pre&s;ent. If we can e&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;econd part, I hope there will be no great danger of mi&s;taking the fir&s;t. I &s;hall only therefore en|deavour to &s;hew you, that all <HI>clerical amu&s;ements</HI> &s;hould be &s;uited to the <HI>clerical profe&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;Now in order to throw the be&s;t light on this &s;ubject, I &s;hould wi&s;h to con&s;ider amu&s;ements under the three heads of <HI>riotous and cruel</HI>&mdash;of <HI>trifling and &s;educing</HI>&mdash;and la&s;tly, of <HI>innocent, and in&s;tructive:</HI> for I think it very po&s;&s;ible, that an amu&s;e|ment may be characterized with both
<PB N="23" REF="25">
the&s;e epithets, though either may be &s;ufficient. Are the&s;e heads, added he, comprehen&s;ive enough to include all kinds of amu&s;ement? Or do you recollect any other?</P>
<P>I thought them &s;ufficiently com|prehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Well, then, &s;aid the Dean, we will begin with &s;uch amu&s;ements as are <HI>riotous,</HI> and <HI>cruel:</HI> and among the&s;e I &s;hould be inclined to a&s;&s;ign the fir&s;t rank to <HI>hunting.</HI> It is an un&s;eeling exerci&s;e, derived from our &s;avage an|ce&s;tors, who hunted at fir&s;t for <HI>food,</HI> and con&s;igned the barbarous practice
<PB N="24" REF="26">
to their po&s;terity for <HI>pa&s;time.</HI> Its giving birth to fore&s;t laws, and game laws&mdash;its injuring corn-lands, and de&s;troying fences&mdash;its &s;etting &s;quires, and their tenants; gentlemen, and their neighbours, at variance&mdash;its con|&s;uming the forage of a country in breeding de&s;tructive, or u&s;ele&s;s animals in the room of &s;uch as are really u&s;e|ful&mdash;the riotous uproar of the cha&s;e, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the mild &s;erenity, which &s;hould characterize the clergyman&mdash; and the noi&s;y, intemperate evening, to which it often leads; add &s;uch an accumulation of mi&s;chief to hunting, that I &s;hould be &s;orry any clergyman &s;hould give his countenance to it.&mdash;To
<PB N="25" REF="27">
this we may add the cruelty exerci&s;ed both on the animals, that pur&s;ue, and the animals, that are pur&s;ued&mdash;the hor&s;e pu&s;hed to the la&s;t extremity&mdash; the hound trained to the cha&s;e with &s;avage barbarity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;At his foot</L>
<L>The &s;paniel dying for &s;ome venial fault,</L>
<L>Under di&s;&s;ection of the knotted &s;courge.</L>
<BIBL>COWPER.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>&mdash;and the wretched fugitive agonizing in the extremity of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But there is &s;till a greater mi&s;chief, which often attends the&s;e riotous amu&s;ements. When the &s;quire hunts
<PB N="26" REF="28">
with his neighbours, he introduces no more corruption into the pari&s;h than he found. But I have &s;ometimes known annual hunts e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;porting countries, which draw toge|ther hundreds of profligate people from different parts, who call them|&s;elves <HI>gentlemen,</HI> but are really <HI>pe&s;ts</HI> of the neighbourhood, to which they re|&s;ort; introducing new vices into the villages, and every kind of debauch|ery. Their &s;ervants, who are com|monly of the &s;ame &s;tamp, &s;pread the corruption among the pea&s;ants, and &s;ervant-girls, which their ma&s;ters &s;pread among the farmers' &s;ons, and daughters.&mdash;The clergyman, who
<PB N="27" REF="29">
mixes in &s;uch &s;cenes, is far out of &s;ight of the bare decency of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But pray, Sir, &s;aid I, may not &s;ome little plea be offered in favour of hunting? Is it not a manly exerci&s;e? Does it not furni&s;h our tables with food; and rid the country of noxious animals?</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, &s;aid the Dean, do not call in argument to defend a pa&s;|time, which has no alliance with rea|&s;on. Call it a wild pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;a brutal propen&s;ity&mdash;or anything that indicates its nature. But to give it any con|nection
<PB N="28" REF="30">
with rea&s;on, is making a union between black and white.&mdash;But it is <HI>manly</HI> for&s;ooth to hunt. <HI>Manli|le&s;s,</HI> I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, implies &s;ome mode of action, that <HI>becomes a man.</HI> Hunting might formerly, for aught I know, have been a manly exerci&s;e, when the country was overrun with boars, and wolves, and it was a <HI>public &s;ervice</HI> to extirpate them. But to ho|nour with the name of <HI>manline&s;s</HI> the cruel practice of pur&s;uing timid animals to put them to death merely for <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> is, in my opinion, perverting the mean|ing of words. There are many ways &s;urely of u&s;ing manly exerci&s;e, at lea&s;t as healthful&mdash;and far more innocent,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
and le&s;s expen&s;ive, and dangerous, than galloping over hedges, gates, and ditches. If the <HI>manline&s;s</HI> of the action lie in the ri&s;k you run of break|ing your neck, for no end, it would &s;till be greater manline&s;s to jump down a precipice.&mdash;The fox-hunter, I doubt not, would ridicule the man, who runs about with a hand-net, hunting a butterfly: but I prote&s;t, I &s;ee not for what rea&s;on. The exerci&s;e of the butterfly-hunter is as good; and the plea&s;ure of the cha&s;e is, to him at lea&s;t, equal.&mdash;But you alledge, that hunting &s;upplies the table with food. I dare &s;ay, Sir Roger's game-keeper will tell you, he could &s;upply it better
<PB N="30" REF="32">
in many other ways. I have certainly no objection to take the lives of ani|mals for food; and grant, that if they were &s;uffered to multiply, they would become noxious. What I mean is, that I cannot allow turning the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of them into an <HI>amu&s;ement</HI>&mdash;and lea&s;t of all into a <HI>clerical amu&s;ement.</HI>&mdash;I knew a gentleman, who took great delight in knocking down an ox; which he per|formed with much dexterity: and it was his common amu&s;ement to go among the butchers on a &s;laughtering-day, and give two or three of them a &s;hilling a-piece, to let him be their &s;ub&s;titute in that operation. You call &s;uch a man a brute: and he &s;urely
<PB N="31" REF="33">
was one. But you would find it diffi|cult to &s;hew, that the circum&s;tance of riding on a hor&s;e, and bawling after a pack of dogs, makes the amu&s;e|ment le&s;s brutal.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;aid I, Sir, there is a differ|ence between the plea&s;ure of a pur|&s;uit; and a plea&s;ure, which con&s;i&s;ts merely in the act of inflicting death?</P>
<P>Why, yes, an&s;wered the Dean, there is a difference; but I know not, on which &s;ide of it the advantage lies. If hunting be a more <HI>genteel</HI> &s;pecies of butchery, it is certainly a more <HI>cruel</HI> one. The ox receives its death
<PB N="32" REF="34">
by an in&s;tant &s;troke; whereas the hare is fir&s;t thrown into convul&s;ions of terror, for four or five hours toge|ther; and then &s;eized, in the mid&s;t of its agony, and torn piece-meal by a pack of ravenous blood-hounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Dete&s;ted &s;port,</L>
<L>That owes its plea&s;ure to another's pain!</L>
<L>That feeds upon the &s;obs, and dying &s;hrieks</L>
<L>Of harmle&s;s nature!&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>COWPER.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.&mdash; As to your la&s;t argument, that hunt|ing rids the country of noxious ani|mals, I apprehend you are mi&s;taken in the fact. I rather think it tends to repleni&s;h the country with them. As one in&s;tance at lea&s;t I can te&s;tify, that I

offended a whole club of &s;porting neighbours in a manner, that was hardly ever to be gotten over, by giving a man half-a-crown for killing a fox, which had thinned my poultry-yard. And I dare &s;ay, there is not a hunting &s;quire in the country, who would not, at any time, give up a do|zen of his tenant's lambs, to &s;ave half the number of foxes' cubs. Nay, I have often known covers of con&s;iderable extent, left purpo&s;ely in fields, or per|haps planted, merely to decoy foxes into a neighbourhood by providing a proper &s;helter for them.&mdash;But you have provoked me to &s;ay all this by aiming to e&s;tabli&s;h an alliance between

hunting and rationality. I intended not to di&s;turb the &s;quire either in his riotous day, or his roaring night.

<P>It is but ju&s;t however to &s;ay, that examples to warn him might al&s;o be found in our own profe&s;&s;ion. I re|member a clergyman in a neighbour|hood, where I once lived, who had two benefices; but he &s;pent little time at either of them, becau&s;e neither

happened to be in a &s;porting country. The hunting-&s;ea&s;on he always &s;pent near a &s;quire in the pari&s;h next to mine, who&s;e di&s;ciplined pack was famous. With this gentleman, and his hounds, he lived on terms of the greate&s;t inti|macy. Indeed both the &s;quire and his dogs looked up to him, as their able&s;t leader. Though he was a mi|&s;erable preacher, he was uncommonly mu&s;ical in the field; and could cheer, and animate his &s;onorous friends with an eloquence beyond the hunt&s;man him&s;elf, who&s;e a&s;&s;ociate he always was, and who&s;e place, on any emergency, he could amply &s;upply. He was much readier at finding a hare, than
<PB N="36" REF="38">
a text of &s;cripture; and though he was &s;carce acquainted with the face of one of his pari&s;hioners, he knew ex|actly the character of every hound in the &s;quire's pack; and could run over their names with much more readi|ne&s;s, than tho&s;e of the twelve apo|&s;tles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Oh laugh, or mourn with me, the rueful je&s;t,</L>

<P>Such a clergyman, &s;aid I, is hardly to be paralleled in a century. But in an inferior degree, I fear, there are many of our brethren, who allow them&s;elves great indulgence. I re|member a hunting-clergyman, who received a very proper rebuke from one of his brethren; and which I have rea&s;on to believe was of &s;ervice to him, as long as he lived. He had been lamenting his unfortunate lot, in being &s;tationed in a country, where
<PB N="38" REF="40">
there was no hunting. The other looking him full in the face, &s;aid with great gravity of countenance, and in a deliberate tone of voice; "At the great day of accounts, the que&s;tion will not be, <HI>where</HI> have you lived; but <HI>how</HI> have you lived?"&mdash;All this however is carrying amu&s;ement to ex|ce&s;s. But &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, when you are riding out, you happen to hear the hounds, is there any harm merely in taking a little exerci&s;e with them, if you do not join in the riot of the cha&s;e?</P>
<P>I hate, &s;aid the Dean, to &s;ee a man do any thing by halves. Is it right,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
or is it wrong? If it be right, do it boldly. If it be wrong, turn your hor&s;e another way, and take your ex|erci&s;e in a contrary direction. Never go to the edge of a precipice. You can hardly help going a little farther than you intended. I remember hearing a &s;tory of a clergyman, who was not remarkable for neglecting, at lea&s;t the outward part of his duty; but once unhappily forgot it through his love for hunting. He was eager|ly engaged in a fox-cha&s;e, when the fox <HI>took to earth,</HI> as they call it: on which he cried out,
<Q>Gentlemen, I mu&s;t leave you: This puts me in mind, that I have a corp&s;e to bury
<PB N="40" REF="42">
at four o'clock this evening; and I fear I &s;hall be an hour too late.</Q>&mdash; Be&s;ides, continued the Dean, you cannot well avoid, in this field of riot, at lea&s;t if you are often &s;een in it, making an acquaintance with &s;everal, to whom, for your character's &s;ake, you would not wi&s;h to be known.&mdash; But indeed, as I ob&s;erved, to mix, in any degree, in the&s;e &s;cenes of cruelty, and riotous exultation, is un|becoming the clerical profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash; Farther &s;till, (to clo&s;e my argument with &s;cripture) I &s;hould wi&s;h you to con&s;ider, that as many good people, as well as I, di&s;approve a clergyman's mixing in the&s;e riotous amu&s;ements,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
&s;o of cour&s;e it will give offence to all the&s;e good people. No man there|fore, who has the honour of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion at heart, would give offence, where the matter in que&s;tion is of &s;o little con&s;equence as a mere amu&s;e|ment. Let him con&s;ider how &s;trict St. Paul was in matters of this kind. St. Paul's example is certainly not very fa&s;hionable; but with a clergy|man, I &s;hould hope it might have &s;ome weight. He gives us many hints, which come home to the point, we are now di&s;cu&s;&s;ing. Hunting was out of the que&s;tion. He would not certainly have permitted Timothy, or Titus to hunt, if they had been &s;o
<PB N="42" REF="44">
di&s;po&s;ed. But he forbids us to give offence in matters, that are of much more concern, than mere amu&s;ement. <HI>If meat,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>make my brother to offend, I will eat no fle&s;h, while the world &s;tandeth, le&s;t I make my brother to offend.</HI></P>
<P>I told the good Dean, he had &s;i|lenced me. I was afraid my love for the diver&s;ion had been founded rather on inclination, than argument. But no|body again, I hoped, &s;hould, ever <HI>take offence</HI> at my following a pack of hounds.&mdash;But pray, &s;aid I, Sir, do you allow &s;hooting? It is a much le&s;s riotous amu&s;ement; nay, it may even be a &s;olitary one.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">To &s;peak plainly, replied the Dean, I cordially allow no <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> to a clergyman that has any thing to do with <HI>&s;hedding blood.</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ides, I think a peculiar cruelty attends this diver|sion. You may wound, and maim, as well as kill. My <HI>heart,</HI> I am &s;ure, would be &s;trongly affected&mdash;indeed, even my <HI>con&s;cience</HI>&mdash;if I &s;hould make a poor animal mi&s;erable all the days of its life, for the &s;ake of giving my|&s;elf a momentary amu&s;ement.&mdash;It was but the la&s;t autumn, when riding down a lane, I &s;aw two poor mi&s;erable partridges&mdash;both bleeding, and one trailing a &s;hattered leg after it&mdash;flut|tering, and running before me. Poor
<PB N="44" REF="46">
wretches, &s;aid I, I wi&s;h the per&s;on, who put you into this mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion, may never feel the di&s;tre&s;s he has occa&s;ioned! I then ordered my &s;ervant to di&s;mount, and run after them. The lame one he caught; the other crawled into a hedge, where it probably lingered out its mi&s;erable life a few days longer.</P>
<P>But the expert mark&s;man, I told the Dean, never &s;hoots among a co|vey, but takes his aim at a &s;ingle bird.</P>
<P>And are all &s;hooters, &s;aid he, <HI>ex|pert mark&s;men?</HI> And does the expert
<PB N="45" REF="47">
mark&s;man him&s;elf never maim the bird he aims at, or the bird, that is near it? Often, I have no doubt, he maims both.&mdash;To repel the attack of a bird, or bea&s;t of prey, I have cer|tainly no objection; nor to take the life of an animal for food; though I &s;hould not wi&s;h to make a clergyman the butcher, whether an ox, or a par|tridge is to be &s;laughtered. But to take the life of an animal, except in one, or the other of the&s;e ca&s;es, I hold to be ab&s;olutely immoral. And I think it is no better to run the ri&s;k of maiming it, and making it mi&s;erable for life. The mo&s;t humane way therefore is to take birds with a net,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
which allows you to di&s;charge &s;uch as you wi&s;h, and put to a &s;peedy death tho&s;e you take for food.</P>
<P>But to take birds in a net, &s;aid I, Sir, is not at all in the &s;pirit of &s;port&s;|men.&mdash;Be&s;ides, there are &s;ome &s;pecies of game, as phea&s;ants particularly, which cannot be taken in nets.</P>
<P>Do not tell me, replied the Dean, of the <HI>&s;pirit of &s;port&s;men.</HI> Though the ties of humanity, no doubt, equally bind them; yet to &s;uch hopele&s;s hearers I &s;hould no more attempt to preach, than I &s;hould to their &s;pa|niels.&mdash;Nor do I pretend to know,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
what kind of game may be taken in one way, and what in another: though I have no doubt, but my friend Robert <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Roger's game keeper.</NOTE> could inform me, how phea&s;ants might be taken without &s;hooting them. But what I labour at chiefly is to convince &s;uch &s;ober-minded clergymen, as I conceive you to be, that every &s;pecies of bloody, and cruel amu&s;ement is un&s;uitable to the genius, and temper of a Chri&s;tian divine; and enters more by habit into a character, than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. It is under the idea of tainting a character with profe&s;&s;ional
<PB N="48" REF="50">
habits, that the butcher is prohibited from &s;erving on a jury.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, Sir, I replied, I am only a&s;hamed, that from the dictates of my own rea&s;on I have not &s;ooner acknowledged the truths you &s;et be|fore me. I always had my doubts: but not &s;uppo&s;ing amu&s;ements of this kind to be <HI>&s;inful,</HI> and not conceiving them to be <HI>improper,</HI> from the eager|ne&s;s, with which numbers of my elder brethren pur&s;ue them, I &s;tifled my own &s;ugge&s;tions. But in my pre&s;ent &s;entiments I believe I &s;hall never fire a gun again for my diver&s;ion, at any kind of game.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">To a&s;&s;i&s;t your good re&s;olutions, &s;aid the Dean, I can &s;ugge&s;t two, or three other con&s;iderations, which are worth the attention of a clergyman. He can &s;carce be &s;ettled in any place, in which he will not find the &s;quire of his pari&s;h attached violently to his game; and jealous of every man, who interferes with him in this great point. He is e&s;pecially jealous of the clergyman, whom he con&s;iders as an interloper. I have known many clergymen get into &s;illy &s;quabbles on this &s;core; and by making them&s;elves obnoxious to the &s;quire, render them|&s;elves much le&s;s able to be of &s;ervice in their pari&s;hes. On many occa|&s;ions
<PB N="50" REF="52">
the &s;quire's countenance may be of great u&s;e to the clergyman in ma|naging his parochial affairs: and it is highly imprudent to lo&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance for a trifle.</P>
<P>I once, &s;aid I, experienced this in|convenience my&s;elf. But I had the di&s;cretion, when I found I had rai&s;ed a jealou&s;y, immediately to de&s;i&s;t. At pre&s;ent, I have free permi&s;&s;ion from Sir Roger, and two or three other gentlemen of the country, to range their domains, when I plea&s;e: So that I lay down my arms in the pleni|tude of my power.</P>
<P>I &s;hould wi&s;h &s;till farther to &s;ugge&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="53">
to you, continued the Dean, that if any mi&s;chance, in the&s;e violent exer|ci&s;es, &s;hould happen to a clergyman, it tells much wor&s;e, than when it happens to another per&s;on. How oddly would it &s;ound, if the pari&s;h were told, on a Sunday there could be no &s;ervice, becau&s;e the par&s;on had put out his &s;houlder, the day before, by a fall at a fox-cha&s;e? If a clergy|man lo&s;e a hand, or an eye in &s;hooting, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, I have ge|nerally found the commi&s;eration of people, mixed with a certain degree of contempt. If he had been about his bu&s;ine&s;s, they would &s;ay, it would not have happened.&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ion al&s;o
<PB N="52" REF="54">
of an accidental mi&s;chief, in the&s;e un|clerical amu&s;ements, will always be more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, at lea&s;t it ought, to a clergyman, than to a layman.&mdash;Poor Archbi&s;hop Abbot was a melancholy in&s;tance. He was exemplary in many points, but unhappily indulged him&s;elf in the amu&s;ement of &s;hooting; and as he was taking this exerci&s;e in a park belonging to Lord Zouch in Hamp|&s;hire, he had the misfortune to &s;hoot one of the keepers. After this event, he never recovered his cheerfulne&s;s; and party running high, it gave his enemies a great handle again&s;t him. It was brought as a que&s;tion, whether he could ever again officiate as an
<PB N="53" REF="55">
archbi&s;hop. After a long inquiry, it was determined, that he mu&s;t be de|graded, but that the king might again re&s;tore him; which was accordingly done.&mdash;I could point out a prelate of the&s;e days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the beginning of James II.</NOTE>, who does his character no &s;ervice by being a &s;port&s;man. For|merly he kept a pack of hounds; but has had the decency, &s;ince he ob|tained a mitre, to di&s;mi&s;s them. He is &s;till however his own game-keeper; and is &s;o expert, that he wants no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in furni&s;hing his table with every article of game. Archbi&s;hop Abbot's misfortune reminds me of a
<PB N="54" REF="56">
&s;imilar accident, of which this prelate had nearly been the occa&s;ion. A young lady, who lived near him, was riding quietly along a clo&s;e lane, when a gun went off, on the other &s;ide of the hedge, clo&s;e to her hor&s;e's ear. The bea&s;t took fright&mdash;&s;tarted vio|lently a&s;ide&mdash;and threw her; though providentially &s;he was not hurt. While her &s;ervant was following her hor&s;e, &s;he walked gently up the lane; and coming to an opening in the hedge, the bi&s;hop, in all his &s;hooting accoutrements, pre&s;ented him&s;elf. He made his apology, and hoped &s;he was not hurt. She thanked him for his kind enquiry: but &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="55" REF="57">
have been better plea&s;ed, if it had been needle&s;s.</P>
<P>I told the Dean, I remembered &s;omething of the &s;tory, about two years ago, in the public prints.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid the Dean, &s;he was an arch girl, and in&s;erted it in a very ludi|crous manner; making a laughable contra&s;t between the bi&s;hop's &s;porting attire, and his lawn &s;leeves, and other epi&s;copal habiliments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. John&s;on's profound reverence for the hierarchy made him expect from bi&s;hops the highe&s;t degree of decorum. There are gradations, he &s;aid, in conduct: there is mo|rality&mdash;decency&mdash;propriety. None of the&s;e &s;hould be violated by a bi&s;hop. When a bi&s;hop places him&s;elf in a &s;ituation, where he has no di&s;tinct character, and is of no con&s;equence, he degrades the dignity of his order. Nor was it only in the dignitaries of the church that Dr. John&s;on required a particular decorum, and delicacy of behaviour; he ju&s;tly con&s;idered, that the clergy, as per&s;ons &s;et apart for the &s;acred office of &s;erving at the altar, and impre&s;&s;|ing the minds of men with the awful concerns of a future &s;tate, &s;hould be &s;omewhat more &s;e|rious than the generality of mankind; and have a &s;uitable compo&s;ure of manners. A due &s;en&s;e of the dignity of their profe&s;&s;ion, inde|pendent of higher motives, will ever prevent them from lo&s;ing their di&s;tinction in an indi&s;|criminate &s;ociality: and did &s;uch as affect this, know how much it le&s;&s;ens them in the eyes of tho&s;e, whom they think to plea&s;e by it, they would feel them&s;elves much mortified.</P>

<P><PB N="56" REF="58">Well, Sir, &s;aid I, I hope the&s;e ex|amples will prove &s;ufficient cautions to me, though I am &s;orry to receive them from &s;uch exalted characters.&mdash; I &s;hould wi&s;h you however to believe, that I am an enemy to cruelty in all
<PB N="57" REF="59">
&s;hapes; and do not remember, that I ever wantonly took the life of the meane&s;t reptile.</P>
<P>We certainly, &s;aid the Dean, have no right. When a &s;pider takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

of my hou&s;e, or a &s;nail of my garden, I make no &s;cruple to de&s;troy them. They are invaders.

If a wolf attempt to &s;eize a lamb, which is my property, and under my protection, I think his life &s;hould pay the forfeit. But if he can &s;eize an antelope, or any other wild animal, with which I have no concern, I have no authority to inter|fere. He has the &s;ame deed of gift to alledge for &s;eizing his prey, which I have for the beef, or mutton I buy in the market. And yet I know not, whether I &s;hould not put him to

death, wherever I found him, as a pro&s;cribed villain; as always acting under at lea&s;t a tacit declaration of war again&s;t me.

<P>I fully accede, &s;aid I, Sir, to your code of criminal law between man, and bea&s;t. It is certainly power, not
<PB N="60" REF="62">
right, that we appeal to, in wantonly di&s;po&s;ing of the lives of animals. And what &s;urpri&s;es me the more, is, we often &s;ee this wanton breach of natural law in men of humanity. An acquaintance of mine, who is as rea|dy as any man to do a good-natured action, will &s;tand whole mornings by the &s;ide of a bridge, &s;hooting &s;wal|lows, as they thread the arch, and flit pa&s;t him. He is however no clergy|man.</P>
<P>Let him be what he will, &s;aid the Dean, his profe&s;&s;ion has been mi&s;taken, and he ought to have been bred a butcher. I can have no conception
<PB N="61" REF="63">
of the humanity of a man, who can find his amu&s;ement in de&s;troying the happine&s;s of a number of little inno|cent creatures, &s;porting them&s;elves, during their &s;hort &s;ummer, in &s;kim|ming about the air; and without doing injury of any kind, pur&s;uing only their own little happy excur&s;ions, and catching the food, which Providence has allotted them.&mdash;But I have &s;een in&s;tances enough of this kind of cru|elty to remove all &s;urpri&s;e. More offence from &s;uch de&s;poti&s;m I never remember to have taken, than, about five or &s;ix years ago, in a little voyage I made into the Iri&s;h &s;ea. A nephew of mine, the captain of a cruizer,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
whom you &s;aw here la&s;t &s;ummer, was then lying at Milford-haven; and, being about to take the voyage I have mentioned, was de&s;irous to carry me with him, as I had expre&s;&s;ed an incli|nation to &s;ee the wonderful rocky barrier, which nature had formed again&s;t the ocean, along many of the coa&s;ts of Wales. As we drew near a promontory, where the rocks were lofty, we found them inhabited by thou&s;ands of &s;ea-fowl of different kinds, which at that &s;ea&s;on frequent them. I was greatly amu&s;ed with &s;eeing the variety of their bu&s;y ac|tions, and different modes of flight; and with hearing the har&s;h notes of
<PB N="63" REF="65">
each, when &s;ingle; and their varied tones, changed into a &s;ort of wild harmony, by the clangor of all toge|ther. One &s;hould have thought a co|lony, like this, might have been &s;afe from all annoy. They are u&s;ele&s;s when dead&mdash;and harmle&s;s when alive. &mdash;We &s;aw however, as we proceeded, two or three boats anchoring at differ|ent di&s;tances, in which were certain <HI>&s;avages</HI>&mdash;I can call them by no other name&mdash;diverting them&s;elves with &s;hooting at the&s;e poor birds, as they flew from their ne&s;ts, or returned to them with food from the &s;ea; de|&s;troying not only the parent-birds, but leaving the helple&s;s progeny to
<PB N="64" REF="66">
clamour in vain for food, and die of hunger. This mode of taking life for no end, is a &s;pecies of cruelty, which I &s;hould wi&s;h to brand with the &s;evere&s;t name; and &s;hould almo&s;t dete&s;t a clergyman, who &s;hould find his amu&s;ement in it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t allow, &s;aid I, Sir, that what you have &s;aid again&s;t hunting, and &s;hooting, hath entirely convinced me of the impropriety of both, as clerical amu&s;ements.&mdash;You have &s;aid nothing however again&s;t fi&s;hing. Do you al|low me to &s;uppo&s;e, this amu&s;ement to be a clerical one? It is &s;ilent, quiet, and may be contemplative.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">I am afraid, replied the Dean, I &s;hall be thought too rigid if I abridge a clergyman of this amu&s;ement. Only I ab&s;olutely enjoin him not to impale worms on his hook; but to fi&s;h either with an artificial fly or a dead bait. If he like fi&s;hing with a net, I approve it more: but &s;till I cannot bring my&s;elf to <HI>recommend</HI> any <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> to him, which ari&s;es from <HI>de&s;troying life.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="68">Why yes, an&s;wered the Dean; but I doubt whether we get much from the&s;e authorities. Fi&s;hing, you know, was the occupation of &s;everal of the apo&s;tles: they fi&s;hed with nets for a livelihood: and St. Peter, you will remember, did not <HI>ca&s;t his hook into the &s;ea</HI> for his <HI>amu&s;ement.</HI> However, you find I am not very rigid on this head.&mdash;Indeed all I have &s;aid about taking the lives of animals amounts only to this&mdash;that we have no right to do it except for food, or to get rid of a nui&s;ance&mdash;and that when we are obliged to take life, we &s;hould always take it in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner. All this appears to me &s;o much the dic|tate

of nature, and truth, that no man can controvert it <HI>in rea&s;on,</HI> whatever he may do <HI>in practice.</HI> But the cler|gyman is under the &s;till &s;tricter ties of decency, and re&s;pect to his character.</P>
<P>But have not you, Sir, &s;aid I, con|fined within too &s;trict a limit the power of man over the lives of ani|mals? Are there not other rea&s;ons, be&s;ides obtaining food, and the re|moval of a nui&s;ance, which may make the exerci&s;e of that power lawful? May we not take the whale for his oil, and the beaver for his fur?</P>
<P>I allow it, &s;aid the Dean. Where

the u&s;es of man preponderate, his right over the animal &s;eems ju&s;t. But perhaps greater liberty may be com|monly taken in this matter, than my code will allow. If the u&s;e be trivial, I reject the claim. I permit you to take the whale for his oil; but I &s;hould not readily grant you leave to de&s;troy the elephant for his tooth.</P>
<P>I told the Dean, I &s;aw the difference very plainly. But, &s;aid I, Sir, do you allow the philo&s;opher to take life in making his re&s;earches into nature? in examining the wonders of the micro|&s;cope; in tracing the circulation of the blood; in di&s;covering the proper|ties

of air; and in other things, which tend to advance human knowledge, and often &s;erve &s;ome great end of utility?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion, &s;aid the Dean, is rather more difficult. What pro|motes human knowledge, or &s;erves any e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;e of utility, is cer|tainly of more con&s;equence, than the life of an animal: and I give you li|berty to take it, when you are &s;ure your motive is good. But I &s;hould interdict this privilege to mere <HI>curio|&s;ity.</HI> We may believe, on the credit of others, that the blood circulates;
<PB N="70" REF="72">
or that an animal will die in an ex|hau&s;ted receiver.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked the Dean, if he did not think, on the other hand, that we might carry our tenderne&s;s in taking life too far? I have frequently, &s;aid I, de&s;erted a path I wi&s;hed to walk in, becau&s;e I have found it pre-occupied by a train of ants, which it hurt me to cru&s;h. And yet I have &s;ometimes thought my caution unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>No doubt, replied the Dean, every virtue has its extremes&mdash;its <HI>ultra</HI> (as we ju&s;t ob&s;erved) as well as its <HI>citra.</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="73">
I have often &s;een this tenderne&s;s in taking life carried to a ridiculous length, if we can call any thing ridi|culous, that is founded on an amiable principle. I knew a humane man, who would not &s;uffer a mou&s;e to be taken in a &s;nap-trap. He allowed it to be taken alive; but he took care to have it carried to a di&s;tance into the fields, and there &s;et at liberty. He would not de&s;troy a &s;pider, though he made no &s;cruple to &s;weep away its web. My dear Sir, I once &s;aid to him, <HI>your tender mercies are cruel.</HI> It would certainly be more merciful to di&s;patch the&s;e poor animals at once, than to make them mi&s;era|ble
<PB N="72" REF="74">
by turning them adrift, or leav|ing them to a langui&s;hing death by taking from them their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. All this therefore &s;eems to me ab&s;urd. It is making the lives of animals of more con|&s;equence than they &s;hould be. It is making a man mi&s;erable for the &s;ake of a mite. For if we carry this ten|derne&s;s as far as it will fairly go, we ought neither to eat a plum, nor ta&s;te a drop of vinegar. It is not &s;ize, which gives value to life. The in&s;ect, that forms the blue of a plum, or that fri&s;ks in a drop of vinegar, has certainly the &s;ame claim to exi&s;t, as a &s;pider, or a mou&s;e. And how far life
<PB N="73" REF="75">
extends, we know not; &s;o that our tenderne&s;s in this re&s;pect, if indulged to exce&s;s, might be endle&s;s. Like Indian Bramins, we &s;hould not dare to lie down, or &s;et a foot to the ground, without examining every foot&s;tep with micro&s;copical exactne&s;s. But as the&s;e little &s;warms of nature interfere thus with all the concerns of men, it is plain, that Providence does not lay much &s;tre&s;s on their lives. All there|fore that &s;eems required, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is to ab&s;tain from wanton in|jury.&mdash;I would not however have you always take the mea&s;ure of a man's virtue by the extraordinary tenderne&s;s of his feelings. I knew a gentleman,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
&s;o extremely tender towards the lives of animals, that when an earwig crept out of a log of wood, which had been laid on his fire, he forbade any more logs to be taken from that pile, and left it to rot, Yet this very man, with all the&s;e nice feelings about him, lived avowedly in a &s;tate of adultery. Such tenderne&s;s therefore may, or may not, be allied to virtue&mdash;certainly not nece&s;&s;arily &s;o allied. It is founded merely in nature. But when <HI>any one</HI> affection of the mind is regulated by a <HI>religious principle,</HI> there is in that mind a <HI>controlling power,</HI> which regulates <HI>other</HI> affections. Thus if we ab&s;tain from cruelty on a <HI>religious principle,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="77">
we may depend on that <HI>principle</HI> on other occa&s;ions. As to the&s;e <HI>delicate feelings,</HI> they &s;eldom reach beyond their <HI>immediate object.</HI>&mdash;Here the Dean made a pau&s;e, and after a little recollection, &s;aid, he thought we had now run over all the <HI>riotous,</HI> and <HI>cruel</HI> amu&s;ements, which he could recollect. As for <HI>cock-fighting,</HI> and <HI>hor&s;e-racing,</HI> he added, they are &s;uch gambling di|ver&s;ions, that I conceive no clergy|man would even be pre&s;ent at the former; nor enter into the &s;pirit of the latter. The race-ground is a wide field, and if he ever enter it for curio&s;ity, he will not only avoid the deep concerns, and commerce of the
<PB N="76" REF="78">
place, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it; but will al&s;o keep entirely aloof from the noi&s;e, and bu&s;tle, and clamour of the &s;cene. A friend of mine lived on the confines of a celebrated race-ground. He was fond of hor&s;es, merely as beautiful objects, which he liked to &s;ee in their various motions: and as people are generally well mounted at a race, and much agitated, he u&s;ed to gratify his curio&s;ity by walking out in an evening, about the time the race was over; and would get behind &s;ome hedge, where un&s;een he had a good view of the company returning from their &s;port over a fair plain. This was to him the only

amu&s;ement of a race; and he would &s;ay, he believed he had more plea&s;ure from the &s;ober enjoyment of this moving picture, than any one could feel, who entered into the wild joy, and jollity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Here our conver&s;ation ended at that time. The good Dean com|plaining, that his feet grew a little trouble&s;ome, rang for his &s;ervant to change his po&s;ture; and I thinking my&s;elf in the way, wi&s;hed him a good night.</P>

<P>I know not, &s;aid I, Sir, whether I thought quite &s;o ill of them. I have always been accu&s;tomed to think, that moderately u&s;ed, they were an inno|cent amu&s;ement even for a clergy|man.</P>
<P>But pray, &s;aid the Dean, in exa|mining the propriety or impropriety, the innocence, or guilt, of an action, are you to con&s;ider, how it affects your&s;elf alone; or how it affects the public in general?</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="81">No doubt, I replied, a public-&s;pirited man will con&s;ider his actions in refer|ence to the public.</P>
<P>He certainly ought, &s;aid the Dean; and this being allowed, do not you con&s;ider the pre&s;ent rage for card-playing, through all ranks of people, as a public evil?</P>
<P>I replied, it was, no doubt, an amu&s;e|ment much abu&s;ed: but the abu&s;e, I thought, lay only at the door of the abu&s;er. Meat, and drink, were abu&s;ed&mdash;dre&s;s was abu&s;ed&mdash;the Bible it&s;elf was abu&s;ed: but we mu&s;t have the&s;e things notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="82">Aye, there, returned the Dean, you point out the true di&s;tinction. You an&s;wer your&s;elf. We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have the one; but <HI>need not</HI> have the other. Does it follow, becau&s;e we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have meat, and drink, though they are abu&s;ed, that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have cards al&s;o?&mdash;If then cards be al|lowed to be a public evil; and we are, at the &s;ame time, under <HI>no nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to have them, every con&s;cientious man would give up a thing &s;o trifling (as an amu&s;ement, at be&s;t, is) to avert that evil: and by refraining, he cer|tainly does avert it, as far as his own i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fluence, and example reach.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="83">You do not mean, &s;aid I, Sir, that cards are in them&s;elves e&s;&s;entially bad?</P>
<P>Why, no, &s;aid he. Cards <HI>in them|&s;elves</HI> may afford as innocent amu&s;e|ment as any thing el&s;e. And yet I know not whether this conce&s;&s;ion is not too much. I have been u&s;ed my&s;elf to con&s;ider amu&s;ements under the head of &s;uch as are &s;trictly &s;ocial; and of &s;uch as contain in them a principle adver&s;e to &s;ociety. Many amu&s;ements are of the former kind; but cards, and &s;ome other games, in which one party mu&s;t be victorious, and the other &s;ubdued, encourage a
<PB N="84" REF="84">
kind of principle &s;omewhat oppo&s;ite to the &s;ocial temper: and the many little &s;quabbles, even among friends, at &s;uch games, prove the truth of my remark. However, if they could be played at with &s;uch moderation, as occa&s;ioned no heart-burning, I &s;hould be inclined to wave <HI>this objection;</HI> and con&s;ider chiefly the <HI>exce&s;s.</HI> It is this indeed which creates the great mi&s;chief; and the <HI>example</HI> &s;preads it. If cards are played in the parlour, they de&s;cend to the kitchen: and from your parlour, and kitchen, to tho&s;e of your neighbour, and &s;o on. The lu&s;t of card-playing is now become &s;o flagitious, that every &s;erious man, I
<PB N="85" REF="85">
affirm, ought to withdraw his own ex|ample from &s;o general, and pernicious a practice. The clergyman, in par|ticular, &s;hould dread to &s;anction, what has certainly &s;o bad an effect on the manners of the people.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, Sir, my example is of &s;o little weight, that it cannot make things either better, or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>There is not, replied the Dean, with &s;ome warmth, in the whole ma|gazine of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, a more de|&s;tructive mode of it, than this. I will not &s;et a good example, becau&s;e I know another will not follow it. So
<PB N="86" REF="86">
nobody will &s;et a good example. We have betterrules &s;urely, to direct us, than the practice of other people. When a man thus puts his own prac|tice, and example into the hands of others, and depends upon his neigh|bour's conduct to regulate his own, what reformation can we expect? If we are right, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, it is by chance. Every man's example has its influence, more or le&s;s, which he &s;hould endeavour, for the &s;ake of good order, to make as in&s;tructive as he can, without trou|bling him&s;elf with the example of others. In families, where cards are never played at in the parlour, I dare
<PB N="87" REF="87">
take upon me to &s;ay they are rarely played at in the kitchen: except per|haps where &s;ervants, who have already learned their le&s;&s;on in card-playing families, are introduced.&mdash;And if the obligation to avoid &s;etting a bad ex|ample, in this in&s;tance be general, it binds the eccle&s;ia&s;tic with double force. He &s;hould certainly be the <HI>&s;alt of the earth;</HI> and endeavour to keep every thing, as far as he can, from corruption. Con&s;ider what a change even that might effect. There are perhaps twenty or thirty thou&s;and eccle&s;ia&s;tics of different denomina|tions, &s;cattered about the various parts of England. If each of the&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="88">
influence a dozen, which (including their own families) is no extraordi|nary calculation, con&s;ider what a party would be gained over. Each of the&s;e again, we may &s;uppo&s;e, might have &s;ome influence; and if we may adopt our Saviour's allu&s;ion, we might hope to &s;ee it work like leaven, through the whole ma&s;s. At lea&s;t, we might hope to &s;ee cards confined within the gloomy walls of gaming-hou&s;es, and night-cellars.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould think, &s;aid I, Sir, we &s;hould <HI>begin</HI> our reformation at the&s;e places. If we could get rid of gaming-hou&s;es, and night-cellars,
<PB N="89" REF="89">
which the high, and low vulgar fre|quent, cards might perhaps be left to us &s;ober people as an innocent amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>Not &s;o entirely, my good friend, an&s;wered the Dean. It is not only when cards are carried to this per|nicious height, that I except again&s;t them. Indeed, when a man has taken his degrees at a gaming-table, I have done with him. He is beyond re|ceiving in&s;truction from me. I mu&s;t therefore inform you, that I do not confine the gaming-table to what is called &s;o (as they &s;ay) <GAP DESC="foreign">. I rank under that head all tho&s;e &s;cenes
<PB N="90" REF="90">
of profligacy, &s;cattered, not only through the metropolis, but through every part of the country, where high &s;takes are pledged, and well-dre&s;&s;ed people meet, not &s;o much with a view of amu&s;ement, as with a purpo&s;e to pillage one another.&mdash;The&s;e however are only the <HI>exce&s;&s;es</HI> of card-playing; but for various other rea&s;ons it &s;hould be di&s;couraged. In the be&s;t light, I think, cards afford only a frivolous, and &s;educing amu&s;ement; e&s;pecially to a clergyman. They often lead him into more expence, &s;till &s;hort of what may be called <HI>gaming,</HI> than may be prudent for him to incur. Once engaged in the habit of playing, or
<PB N="91" REF="91">
li&s;ted, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, into the corps of card-players, he cannot &s;ometimes avoid venturing higher &s;takes, than he could wi&s;h.&mdash;But &s;up|po&s;e he keep the &s;cales of lo&s;s and gain pretty even, (as I have &s;ometimes heard the moderate card-player boa&s;t) what &s;hall we &s;ay for the expence of time? Here comes in a very &s;e|ducing part. Evening after evening is lo&s;t. The afternoon is often added. Habits are formed. Play and com|fort are connected; and the day ends in joyle&s;s vacancy, that does not con|clude with cards.&mdash;Be&s;ides, you give your&s;elf into the hands of others. It is un&s;ocial to break up a party. You
<PB N="92" REF="92">
are not therefore ma&s;ter of your&s;elf.&mdash;Then again, con&s;ider, you cannot choo&s;e your company. You are a known card-player; you cannot &s;tand out, when a hand is wanted, and mu&s;t often con&s;ort with tho&s;e you di&s;e&s;teem.&mdash;Above all, young people &s;hould con&s;ider, how ea&s;ily, where amu&s;ements are concerned, the mind glides into habits of indulgence. In the&s;e journeys of plea&s;ure, &s;tep follows &s;tep mechanically. I knew a young lady thus debauched into a card-player, though &s;he was once among the mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex&mdash;dome&s;|tic&mdash;ingenious&mdash;fond of books&mdash;full of re&s;ources, and never at a lo&s;s for
<PB N="93" REF="93">
the employment of her time. Family amu&s;ements were all the plea&s;ures &s;he &s;ought. Her father and mother were excellent people; and brought her up, an only daughter, in, what I may ju&s;tly call, the cheerful re&s;traints of religion. But during a &s;hort vi&s;it at a relation's, to which her father re|luctantly con&s;ented, &s;he unhappily got a ta&s;te for card-playing; and, when &s;he returned home, did not much en|joy tho&s;e innocent dome&s;tic circles, in which, before, &s;he had given, and received, &s;o much plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, &s;he had lo&s;t her heart to this vile amu&s;ement. Soon afterwards &s;he married a young gentleman of for|tune
<PB N="94" REF="94">
&mdash;a &s;ober, virtuous, and mode&s;t young man, but of talents very infe|rior to tho&s;e of his wife. With di&s;|cretion &s;he might have modelled her family, as &s;he had plea&s;ed; and had an excellent model before her, in her father's: but &s;he cho&s;e rather to cor|rupt her hu&s;band, and turn his man|&s;ion into a gaming hou&s;e.&mdash;I mention this example as one among a hundred I have &s;een in my life, to &s;hew the rapid progre&s;s of plea&s;urable habits, and tho&s;e of cards perhaps beyond all others; to which I think particularly belongs that excellent adage, <HI>Princi|piis ob&s;ta.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">But &s;ince, &s;aid I, Sir, we are often obliged to con&s;ort with tho&s;e, whom we di&s;e&s;teem, or with tho&s;e, who&s;e minds are too unfurni&s;hed to bear a part in conver&s;ation, is it not u&s;eful, and often nece&s;&s;ary, to introduce &s;omething, that removes, for the time at lea&s;t, all di&s;gu&s;ts&mdash;&s;omething that may level tho&s;e, who have not &s;en&s;e, with tho&s;e who have; and en|able them to pa&s;s their time together in mutual civility, without labouring to &s;upport a conver&s;ation, which mo&s;t probably more than half of them are utterly unable to &s;upport?</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t time, &s;aid the Dean
<PB N="96" REF="96">
&s;miling, I ever heard cards mentioned as a bond of benevolence: as the cau&s;e of ill-humour, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion, I have often heard them taxed. But I &s;up|po&s;e you do not hold the argument &s;eriou&s;ly. You cannot imagine cards to be more effectual to this end, than even tho&s;e modes of general civility, which commonly reign among polite people; and check, during the inter|cour&s;e, all appearance of &s;uch little ho&s;tilities, as may rankle within. At lea&s;t you mu&s;t allow, that card-playing is not quite a clerical mode of incul|cating benevolence.&mdash;And as to your &s;olicitude to lower the man of wit and &s;en&s;e to a level with his neigh|bours,
<PB N="97" REF="97">
and bring conver&s;ation to an equilibrium, I think it ill-judged. If the man of &s;en&s;e have any good-na|ture in his compo&s;ition, he will not be much hurt at be&s;towing on his weaker neighbour a pittance of his own in|formation, and wi&s;dom. At lea&s;t, it is not well done in you to furni&s;h him with an apology to withhold it. How is the poor man to improve, if on his coming into company, an immediate &s;top is put to all conver&s;ation by calling for cards?&mdash;However, I con&s;i|der this argument only as a &s;huffle. Any conver&s;ation is &s;urely better, than the dull monotony of a card-table. He who can bear the conver&s;ation of
<PB N="98" REF="98">
a card player, may bear any thing. For my&s;elf, I prote&s;t I &s;hould make better company of a parrot.</P>
<P>I cannot, &s;aid I, truly &s;ay much for the conver&s;ation of a card-table, ex|cept that it is innocent, and may keep conver&s;ation from taking a wor&s;e turn.</P>
<P>Why, yes, &s;aid the Dean, and &s;o it would, if you &s;hould clap a gag, into every body's mouth, when he went into company. At the &s;ame time I &s;hould lay but little &s;tre&s;s either on one expedient, or the other. A &s;hort <HI>re&s;traint</HI> affords no <HI>amendment.</HI> Bring
<PB N="99" REF="99">
the axe to the root of the tree&mdash;cor|rect the heart&mdash;and you do &s;omething. But till that be done, the propen&s;ity to &s;candal, may be <HI>checked,</HI> but will find its opportunity to <HI>break out,</HI> whether you play at cards, or not. Perhaps, like fermenting liquor, it may bur&s;t out with more violence from having been confined.</P>
<P>But perhaps, &s;aid I, Sir, it may be worth con&s;ideration, that if people do not employ their vacant time on cards, they may do wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not what they can do wor&s;e,
<PB N="100" REF="100">
an&s;wered the Dean, if you re&s;pect their amu&s;ements only. And if you think cards will keep a young fellow from the &s;tews or a debauch, when he is inclined to either, I fear you attri|bute much more to them, than they de&s;erve. If a man be fond of two games, both are amu&s;ements; and &s;o far as there is a &s;imilitude between them, the love of one may perhaps overpower an attachment to the other. But when a man is fond of a <HI>game,</HI> and addicted to a <HI>vice,</HI> as there is no &s;imilitude between the objects, you have no more ground for expecting the former will drive out the latter,
<PB N="101" REF="101">
than for &s;uppo&s;ing a man's dancing a minuet, &s;hould prevent his admiring a picture.</P>
<P>You drive me, &s;aid I, Sir, out of all my &s;trong holds: but you mu&s;t give me leave to make one ob&s;ervation more. I have heard &s;ickly people &s;peak of cards as a great relief in pain; when the mind is incapable of any other attention. And if exciting this frivolous attention will draw it from attending to its malady, cards, I think, are an opium, and may often be called a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have certainly no objection, re|plied
<PB N="102" REF="102">
the Dean, to their being u&s;ed medicinally. But then I &s;hould wi&s;h to have them &s;old only at the apothe|cary's &s;hop, and the doctor to pre|&s;cribe the u&s;e of them. I &s;hould fear, if the patient pre&s;cribed for him&s;elf, he may be apt to take too large a do&s;e, as he often does of laudanum, and other anodyne drugs. I once knew an old lady, who had lo&s;t the u&s;e of her &s;peech, and of both her hands, by two or three paralytic &s;trokes; and every evening took the remedy you have been pre&s;cribing. She was a lady of large fortune&mdash;gave good &s;uppers&mdash;and had genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly a number of humble friends about her,
<PB N="103" REF="103">
one of whom always, after &s;upper, dealt, &s;orted, and held her cards, and pointing to this, or that, the old lady nodded at the card &s;he wi&s;hed to have her friend play. But it &s;ometimes happened, that the paralytic &s;hake of the head was mi&s;taken for the nod of approbation, and unfortunately a wrong card was played; which threw the old lady (who&s;e whole heart was in the remedy &s;he was taking) into &s;uch violent fits of pa&s;&s;ion, that people thought &s;he received more injury from the&s;e irritations, than benefit from the pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>I fear, &s;aid I, Sir, from all this ridi|cule,
<PB N="104" REF="104">
that you thought what I ad|vanced, rather impertinent.</P>
<P>My ridicule, replied the Dean, was not &s;urely directed at you; but at tho&s;e poor, pitiable objects, who can|not, even at the clo&s;e of life, be hap|py without their cards. I have heard of many &s;uch; and have known &s;ome. At a time, when &s;erious thoughts, and meditation are the mo&s;t becom|ing, it is pitiable, in the la&s;t degree, to &s;ee the dregs of life running off in &s;o wretched a manner. If there is any thing in human nature, which unites contempt, and commi&s;eration, &s;aid a friend of mine (coming from a &s;ight
<PB N="105" REF="105">
of this kind) it is the &s;pectacle of a man going down to the grave with a pack of cards in his hand!</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid I, Sir, the&s;e fright|ful examples are of them&s;elves &s;uffi|cient warnings.&mdash;But I have done. I give up my cau&s;e. I was willing to &s;ay what I could for an amu&s;ement, in which I fear I have had too great an intere&s;t. But I hope, Sir, I &s;hall not be the wor&s;e either for your ridi|cule, or your in&s;truction.&mdash;After all however it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we young clergymen have a difficult part to act. The prevalence of cu&s;tom is
<PB N="106" REF="106">
a vehement tide, which we find it very hard to &s;tem.</P>
<P>I &s;hould therefore, &s;aid the Dean, wi&s;h you to keep out of it; which every man may, if he plea&s;e. Be re|&s;olute at fir&s;t in re&s;i&s;ting importunity, and importunity will pre&s;ently cea&s;e. You will &s;oon be con&s;idered as one who has a will of his own.&mdash;The clergy, I think, may be divided into two great bodies.

<PB N="107" REF="107">
goods. With them my arguments have nothing to do. They have no &s;cruples; and will comply of cour&s;e with every thing that will recommend them to the world.&mdash;In the other cla&s;s are many, no doubt, who have the end and honour of their profe&s;&s;ion at heart; and wi&s;h only to be con|vinced of the propriety, or impro|priety of a thing, to do it, or leave it undone. But there are numbers, I fear, in this cla&s;s, well-meaning, on the whole, and &s;erious men, who are yet ready to make the cu&s;toms of the world an apology for a variety of im|proper practices; and &s;lide into a number of corrupt habits, without
<PB N="108" REF="108">
con&s;idering that to oppo&s;e the &s;e|ducing cu&s;toms of the world is the very e&s;&s;ence of a &s;tate of trial; and that it is the very bu&s;ine&s;s of a good pa&s;tor to &s;et up his own example as a way mark again&s;t them.</P>
<P>To all this I fully a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>Aye, Mr. Frampton, continued the Dean, with much earne&s;tne&s;s in his manner, the&s;e are &s;erious truths. The cu&s;toms of the world put a glo&s;s upon many improper things&mdash;among which I reckon cards; and mi&s;lead numbers, who are glad perhaps to mi&s;interpret the apo&s;tle, and tell you, that if they
<PB N="109" REF="109">
do them not, <HI>they mu&s;t altogether go out of the world.</HI> But whatever liber|ties the layman takes (and yet I know not what gives him any exclu&s;ive li|berty) the clergyman ought to be particularly guarded again&s;t the in|dulgence of any amu&s;ement, which is fraught with &s;o much mi&s;chief, both public and private; which &s;o ea&s;ily gains ground by the force of habit; and in the defence of which, you &s;ee, &s;o little can be &s;aid. Many bad ha|bits &s;ub&s;ide in age. Nature cannot hold out. But here is a mi&s;chievous propen&s;ity, which cleaves often to our very la&s;t &s;and. It is po&s;&s;ible, I may yet live to &s;ee people &s;o barefaced, as
<PB N="110" REF="110">
to make no di&s;tinction of days, and play at cards on Sundays. It is prac|ti&s;ed, I am informed, in France, from which we derive too many of our fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>I told the Dean, that, as I believed I was better acquainted with the hi|&s;tory of card-playing, than he was, I was afraid that vile practice, though not frequent, had gotten at lea&s;t &s;ome footing among <HI>us.</HI> One in&s;tance I knew. I had, not long ago, the ho|nour to be admitted, in a dearth of better company, to the card-table of a lady of fa&s;hion. Soon after I found &s;he played at cards on Sundays; when
<PB N="111" REF="111">
fearing le&s;t I &s;hould be involved in the imputation of that practice, I ne|ver would touch another card at her hou&s;e. On her calling me to account for de&s;erting my po&s;t, I plainly told her the rea&s;on. This led to a &s;hort debate. She &s;aid, after the duties of the day were over (for &s;he was a con|&s;tant church-woman) &s;he thought a little recreation in the evening was very allowable. I talked of the great impropriety at lea&s;t of <HI>breaking down fences,</HI> and laying the practice open to the common people, even though &s;he would not allow any profanation of the day. She thought the fault
<PB N="112" REF="112">
lay in the cattle, that <HI>went through the breach.</HI> At length however &s;he al|lowed that playing at <HI>cards on a Sun|day,</HI> was a very improper practice to get <HI>among the lower people</HI>&mdash;and far|ther, that, when <HI>carried to the height of gaming,</HI> it was a very improper Sun|day-amu&s;ement to <HI>any one.</HI> I beg|ged, &s;he would &s;uffer me to &s;hew her, merely on <HI>the&s;e two conce&s;&s;ions of her own,</HI> the mi&s;chief of playing at cards <HI>at all</HI> on a Sunday. And that &s;he might &s;ee it in the &s;tronger light, I offered to put my arguments on pa|per. But I could never obtain leave. She always &s;topped my mouth with
<PB N="113" REF="113">
&s;aying, &s;he had made up her mind, and wi&s;hed to hear no more on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I honour you, &s;aid the Dean, as I &s;hould every young clergyman, who could make &s;o proper a &s;tand again&s;t a vicious fa&s;hion.&mdash;And now, in re|turn for your &s;tory, in which you have given me an in&s;tance of &s;ome <HI>duplicity,</HI> I will contra&s;t it with one of genuine <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> A friend of mine had a cu|rate, recommended from Cambridge, an excellent young man, who had never been in a &s;crape during the whole time he had been at the uni|ver&s;ity. He was addicted to no im|proper
<PB N="114" REF="114">
amu&s;ement; and cards in particular he di&s;liked. It happened however, on &s;ome &s;ingular occa&s;ion (I believe on that of a young lady's coming of age) he was invited among &s;everal other young folks to &s;pend an evening, where cards made a part of the entertainment. He &s;tood out &s;tre|nuou&s;ly, as wholly ignorant of every game. At la&s;t &s;ome <HI>general game</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have among us at pre&s;ent a kind of game, which is called a <HI>round game,</HI> from the company's &s;itting <HI>round</HI> a table. The Dean probably alludes to &s;ome &s;uch game as this, which might be in u&s;e in his time.</NOTE> (I know not what they call it) being propo&s;ed, and &s;ome of the company
<PB N="115" REF="115">
(as corruptors are always at hand) in&s;tructing him in what he could not but feel he had powers of mind to comprehend, he was drawn in, and &s;at down, though little attentive to the bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he was engaged. At the end of the game, when the accounts of profit and lo&s;s were &s;ettled, his companions gave him four &s;hillings, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, for certain little ivory fi&s;h, which he had received in the cour&s;e of the game. The next morning, when he told the &s;tory, he &s;aid, it was a fortunate thing, that he had been &s;ucce&s;sful; for if he had lo&s;t four &s;hillings, in&s;tead of win|ning them, he &s;hould certainly have
<PB N="116" REF="116">
gone off without paying his debt; as he had not the lea&s;t conception, that the ivory fi&s;h he had received, repre|&s;ented any thing, but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The good Dean having thus di&s;|patched the card-table, led me next to the play-hou&s;e. What a noble in&s;titution, &s;aid he, have we here, if it were properly regulated! I know of nothing that is better calculated for moral in&s;truction&mdash;nothing that holds the gla&s;s more forcibly to the follies and vices of mankind. I would have it go, hand in hand, with the pulpit. It has nothing indeed to do with &s;crip|ture, and Chri&s;tian doctrines. The <HI>pa|geants,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="117">
as, I think, they were called, of the la&s;t century, u&s;ed to repre&s;ent &s;cripture-&s;tories, which were very im|properly introduced, and much bet|ter handled in the pulpit. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for the pulpit to repre&s;ent vice and folly in &s;o &s;trong a light as the &s;tage. One addre&s;&s;es our rea&s;on, the other our imagination; and we know which receives commonly the more forcible impre&s;&s;ion. There &s;hould always however be a little da&s;h of the <HI>caricature</HI> to give a ze&s;t to <HI>character.</HI> But nature and proba|bility &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved. I remember&mdash;I believe it is now thirty years ago&mdash;&s;eeing a play acted (I for|get
<PB N="118" REF="118">
its title) in which an old fellow is repre&s;ented dallying with a coquetti&s;h girl. It was an admirable picture from nature. The &s;prightly actions of youth imitated by the ridiculous ge&s;ticulations of age, &s;truck my me|mory &s;o forcibly, that the picture is yet as fre&s;h, as if it had been painted ye&s;terday.&mdash;As <HI>moral repre&s;entations,</HI> I cannot &s;ay, I think Shake&s;pear's plays are models. There is a fund of nature in them&mdash;va&s;t invention &mdash;and a variety of pa&s;&s;ions admi|rably coloured. I wi&s;h I could for|get the loo&s;e fancy, which wantons through mo&s;t of them, and is ex|tremely di&s;agreeable to a cha&s;te ear.
<PB N="119" REF="119">
But what I chiefly remark, is, that I do not <HI>commonly</HI> find in them (what I &s;hould wi&s;h to find in <HI>every</HI> play) &s;ome virtue, or good quality &s;et in an amiable light; or &s;ome vice, or folly &s;et in a dete&s;table one; and made, as it were, the burden of the whole. I call the &s;cenes of Fal&s;taff admirable copies from nature; but I know not what in&s;truction they give, Now I &s;hould wi&s;h to turn the play-hou&s;e into a mode of amu&s;ing in&s;truction; and to &s;uffer no theatrical perform|ance, which did not eminently con|duce to this end. Young men, for in&s;tance, are apt to be led away by vicious plea&s;ures; and to &s;upply their

A play on &s;uch a &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was afterwards a play formed on this very plan, intitled George Barnwell; the moral of which is good, though the execution is far from being faultle&s;s.</NOTE> might per|haps deter many a young man in the beginning of his career.

<P>I a&s;ked the Dean, if he meant to exclude comedy from his theatre?</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="121">By no means, &s;aid he: I &s;hould rather encourage it more than tra|gedy; ina&s;much as I &s;hould have more hope of curing &s;uch vices, and follies, as require the la&s;h, than &s;uch as require the gibbet. My &s;tage-au|thors &s;hould deal much in ridicule, which, when well conducted, and not thrown on individuals, but ca&s;t broad|ly on vice, and folly, I conceive to be an admirable engine. But I &s;hould not ridicule a &s;quinting eye&mdash;a &s;tam|mering voice&mdash;a provincial dialect&mdash; the peculiarities of a profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;or indeed any oddity, or deformity, that was not &s;trictly immoral.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="122">I am afraid, &s;aid I, Sir, you will cut off much of our modern wit by this &s;everity: for the&s;e oddities are, in general, a great &s;ource of it.

the &s;tage from being of much u&s;e in the reformation of manners. The &s;cenery, the dre&s;&s;es, the mu&s;ick, and other appendages of the theatre, make the expence &s;o great, that it can never be brought to a level with the pockets of the multitude.</P>
<P>That is well urged, &s;aid the Dean. I thank you for the hint, and will im|mediately model my dramatic repre|&s;entations in conformity to it.&mdash;We have one church for rich, and poor.

In the fir&s;t, of cour&s;e, there will be more elegance, and more expence; and the drama mu&s;t be &s;uited to the audience by the repre&s;entation of &s;uch vices, and follies, as are found chiefly among the great. The other theatre &s;hall be equally &s;uited to the lower orders. And to enable them the better to partake of the moral amu&s;ement pro|vided for them, I mean to aboli&s;h all

<P>You have now, &s;aid I, Sir, perfectly &s;atisfied me. I &s;hall heartily rejoice in the erection of your two theatres.

All farces I &s;hould recommend to my lower theatre. The &s;tyle of all its com|po&s;itions &s;hould be &s;omewhat in this way. But they &s;hould all certainly have a moral tendency. The &s;arce, as at pre&s;ent u&s;ed, is a mo&s;t ab&s;urd excre&s;cence; and I &s;uppo&s;e intended merely to plea&s;e the vulgar. As there

The hi&s;torian might have reference to the public amu&s;ements of <HI>his own</HI> country; with which he thought it happy, the German ladies had no opportunities of being corrupted. Whatever his preci&s;e meaning was, it &s;hews his general opinion of &s;uch amu&s;ements: and, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will allow Tacitus, though not an apo&s;tle, to be a very good judge of men, and manners.&mdash;Be&s;ides, added the Dean,

<HEAD>THIRD DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day was Sunday, when I happened to be wholly engaged. But on Monday I waited on the good Dean &s;oon after dinner.</P>
<P>I am impatient, &s;aid I, Sir, to have another conver&s;ation with you. You have taken from me my gun, and my dog. You have prohibited my playing at cards, and have refu&s;ed me leave to
<PB N="149" REF="149">
go to an a&s;&s;embly, or to meet my friend at a tavern; and I cannot but be &s;olicitous to know, what amu&s;ement you will at length allow me.</P>
<P>But are not you, replied the Dean, rather unrea&s;onable? I have indeed taken your gun. But as to your dog, you may keep him, if you plea&s;e, for a companion. I have no objection. Have I not at lea&s;t <HI>connived</HI> al&s;o at your fi&s;hing? Have I not intro|duced you to many agreeable &s;ocie|ties? Have I not given you leave to &s;ing, and to dance? And does not all this &s;atisfy you? However, I
<PB N="150" REF="150">
mean &s;till to do more. I wi&s;h only to make your amu&s;ements&mdash;your habits &mdash;your company&mdash;your dre&s;s&mdash;and your profe&s;&s;ion all agree.&mdash;By the way, I am not a little &s;olicitous about the dre&s;s of a clergyman; which I think a matter of more con&s;equence, than the generality of people will perhaps allow. I think it an argu|ment of great lightne&s;s in a clergy|man to endeavour, as far as he can, to adopt the lay-habit. He &s;hews he has embraced his own profe&s;&s;ion only for rea&s;ons of convenience; and in his heart di&s;likes its re&s;traints. I &s;hould wi&s;h to have every clergyman, e&s;pecially when in full orders, obliged
<PB N="151" REF="151">
to appear always in a &s;hort ca&s;&s;ock, under his coat. He could not then &s;o ea&s;ily adopt improprieties in his dre&s;s; and might be more upon his guard al&s;o again&s;t improprieties in his behaviour. His clerical habit would be a continual call upon him for de|corum, as he dur&s;t not, in that garb, do many things, which, dre&s;&s;ed like a layman, he might be tempted to do. Be&s;ides, it might tend to keep &s;uch young men out of the church, as, when in it, are a di&s;grace both to it, and to them&s;elves. Cloathing was originally intended for the &s;ake of de|cency, and warmth. In civilized &s;o|cieties, it became afterwards of u&s;e to
<PB N="152" REF="152">
di&s;tingui&s;h ranks: and if in this in|&s;tance the di&s;tinction were a little more enforced, it would, I am per|&s;uaded, have a good effect.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, &s;aid I, that my wardrobe, if it were all produced before you, would give you no offence. Nothing would be found there, but what is &s;trictly clerical. Indeed I my&s;elf have been often highly offended at the improper dre&s;s of many of my younger brethren. I wonder not, therefore, at <HI>your</HI> being offended.</P>
<P>So far then, an&s;wered the Dean, I may pre&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e upon you, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a hopeful
<PB N="153" REF="153">
di&s;ciple; and that, as you are clerical in your dre&s;s, you will be clerical al&s;o in your amu&s;ements.&mdash;Now as <HI>exer|ci&s;e,</HI> on which health &s;o much depends, is one great end of amu&s;ement, and as the clerical life may in general be called a &s;edentary one, he who pro|vides amu&s;ements for a clergyman, &s;hould have an e&s;pecial view to exer|ci&s;e. But though I forbade the cler|gyman to gallop after hounds, I have no objection to his mounting his hor&s;e, and riding a dozen miles, in a morning, for exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>But without &s;ome end in view, I
<PB N="154" REF="154">
ob&s;erved, few people were fond of a &s;olitary ride.</P>
<P>Solitary ride! exclaimed the Dean. Have you forgotten the philo&s;opher's noble adage, <HI>Nunquam minus &s;olus, quam cum &s;olus?</HI> I &s;hould allow a man brought up in bu&s;ine&s;s to urge &s;uch a pretence: but in a &s;cholar I can|not admit it. The very trot of a hor&s;e is friendly to thought. It beats time, as it were, to a mind engaged in deep &s;peculation. An old acquaintance of mine u&s;ed to find its effect &s;o &s;trong, that he valued his hor&s;e for being a little given to &s;tumbling. I know
<PB N="155" REF="155">
not how far, he would &s;ay, I might carry my contemplation, and to|tally forget my&s;elf, if my hone&s;t bea&s;t did not, now and then, by a fal&s;e &s;tep, jog me out of my reverie; and let me know, that I had not yet gotten above a mile or two out of my road <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory was afterwards told of Dr. Young&mdash;not the author of the Night-thoughts; but another clergyman of that name, remarka|ble for &s;implicity of character, and ab&s;ence of mind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But every &s;cholar, &s;aid I, Sir, has not the art of keeping his thoughts &s;o collected. The trotting of a hor&s;e, even without &s;tumbling,
<PB N="156" REF="156">
may be enough to di&s;&s;ipate his be&s;t meditations.</P>
<P>If he cannot think, an&s;wered the Dean, in one way, let him think in another. If he cannot lay premi&s;es and conclu&s;ions together, and make a &s;ermon; let him con&s;ider &s;ome letter he has to write&mdash;or &s;ome con|ference with a neighbour to manage. He mu&s;t be a very thoughtle&s;s fellow, if he have not &s;ome u&s;eful topic to en|gage his thoughts. Or perhaps he may have &s;ome friend to call upon. At wor&s;t, he may amu&s;e him&s;elf with looking at the country around him. It is a plea&s;ure to &s;ee how differently
<PB N="157" REF="157">
the corn, or the gra&s;s grows in differ|ent pari&s;hes; and to mark its pro|gre&s;s. Every &s;ea&s;on furni&s;hes &s;ome new, and agreeable &s;cene. He &s;ees the woods a&s;&s;ume one appearance in the &s;pring&mdash;another in &s;ummer&mdash; a third in autumn&mdash;and a fourth in winter. And as nature is never at a &s;tand, he &s;ees a continual variation in her &s;cenes. So that, if he have no re&s;ources in him&s;elf, he may &s;till find them in the beauties of nature.</P>
<P>But perhaps, I objected, he is not fond of riding; or he may not be able to keep a hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="158">Let him walk then, &s;aid the Dean. I &s;hould recommend walking to him, as every way a preferable exerci&s;e. Over the hor&s;eman he will enjoy many advantages. He is in&s;tantly equipped. He has only to take his hat, and &s;tick, and call his dog. Be|&s;ides, he need not keep the highway, like the hor&s;eman. He goes over the &s;tile&mdash;he gets into the devious path&mdash; he wanders by the &s;ide of the river, or through the mead&mdash;and if the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered &s;cenes do not make him think, I know not what can do it.&mdash; Be&s;ides, he may u&s;e as <HI>much</HI> exerci&s;e in half the time, which is of con&s;e|quence to a &s;cholar&mdash;and I &s;hould
<PB N="159" REF="159">
&s;uppo&s;e as <HI>whole&s;ome</HI> exerci&s;e.&mdash;But above all things, I &s;hould wi&s;h him to get a habit of thinking methodically as he walks. It will &s;oon become as ea&s;y to think in the fields, as at his de&s;k: and he will enjoy at once the double advantage of &s;tudy, and exer|ci&s;e. Here again, he has an advan|tage over the hor&s;eman. He has his hands at liberty to manage his memorandum-book, and his black-lead pencil; which with the incum|brances of a whip, and a bridle, is more difficult. To think methodi|cally <HI>on hor&s;eback</HI> is the work rather of a &s;trong head, which can con|tinue,
<PB N="160" REF="160">
and carry on an argument&mdash; dige&s;t it in the mind&mdash;and remember the &s;everal parts and dependences of it. <HI>On foot,</HI> the memorandum-book ea&s;es the head of all this trouble, by fixing the argument, as it proceeds. For my&s;elf, the exerci&s;e of walking with a memorandum-book in my hand, hath ever been among the fir&s;t plea&s;ures of my life. When I was a young man, and could go among my poor neighbours, I had three em|ployments at the &s;ame time: vi&s;iting my pari&s;h&mdash;&s;tudying&mdash;and u&s;ing ex|erci&s;e. I have made in the&s;e excur|&s;ions many a &s;ermon. The greate&s;t

part of this book <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Origines Sacrae;</HI> which the Dean had ju&s;t been correcting.</NOTE> was fir&s;t rudely compo&s;ed in the fields, and when I came home, I always dige&s;ted what had occurred in my walk&mdash;con&s;ulted my authorities, and wrote all fair over. And even &s;ince I grew old, when it plea&s;es God to allow me the u&s;e of my feet, I &s;till continue the &s;ame exerci&s;e: only in&s;tead of being able, as I was then, to take a fatiguing excur&s;ion, without paying much at|tention to roads or weather, I am obliged now to &s;horten my walk&mdash; to re&s;t a little, and divide it into por|tions
<PB N="162" REF="162">
&mdash;to creep along ea&s;y paths&mdash;in garden-walks, or under &s;heltering hedges.</P>
<P>Much do I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, Sir, that you could continue with more ea&s;e your u&s;eful walks, in which the world hath &s;o much partaken, and will long partake.&mdash;For my&s;elf, I &s;hall certainly endeavour to imitate an example, which I am convinced is &s;o profitable. I will immediately get a memoran|dum-book; and hope in time to find more plea&s;ure in bringing home the head of a &s;ermon, than I have often done in bringing home a phea&s;ant, or a partridge.&mdash;But &s;till, Sir, there
<PB N="163" REF="163">
are many pious, and good clergymen, who may be great ble&s;&s;ings to their pari&s;hes, and yet were never able to compo&s;e a &s;ermon them&s;elves; and cannot perhaps, by any means, induce a habit of thinking methodi|cally&mdash;What are they to do?</P>
<P>Why they mu&s;t endeavour, &s;aid the Dean, as I advi&s;ed the hor&s;eman in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, to find em|ployment for their thoughts, as they are able. If they are vi&s;iting a poor neighbour in &s;ickne&s;s, or di&s;tre&s;s, they may think what to &s;ay on the occa&s;ion. The duties of his pari&s;h will always be a call to exerci&s;e, and engage a
<PB N="164" REF="164">
worthy clergyman to be frequently abroad in one &s;hape, or other, e&s;pe|cially if his pari&s;h be exten&s;ive.&mdash; He may al&s;o take a book, and read at intervals, which will always furni&s;h &s;ome employment for his thoughts.&mdash;I have heard Sir Roger &s;peak of the mode of exerci&s;e u&s;ed by his late friend Dr. Bret. He would generally, during two hours every day, &s;ally out into the fields, with his &s;pud in his hand; and cut up all the weeds he could meet with. A field of thi&s;tles was to him a &s;porting country: and he u&s;ed to &s;ay, good man! when he was inclined to boa&s;t a little of his benevolent exerci&s;e, that he believed,
<PB N="165" REF="165">
he did not &s;ave his pari&s;hioners le&s;s than a dozen pounds every year in weeding.&mdash;But if walking, after all, except when &s;ome end, or pari&s;h-duty is in view, cannot be made plea|&s;ant to a clergyman, let him &s;eek other exerci&s;e. Does he love a garden? There cannot be a more clerical amu&s;ement, than the cultivation of it. The flower-garden&mdash;the fruit-garden &mdash;or the kitchen-garden may all afford him great amu&s;ement, and are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his character. I &s;hould think it no di&s;credit to a cler|gyman to have his vines, and his fruit-trees better trained by his own hands, than tho&s;e of any profe&s;&s;ed gardener
<PB N="166" REF="166">
in the country: and even his pea&s;e, and beans, and cabbages to be in a more flouri&s;hing condition.&mdash;If he wi&s;h for &s;till &s;tronger exerci&s;e, let him roll his walks, or dig his ground <HI>u&s;que ad &s;uderem.</HI> This will be of great u&s;e to him; for be&s;ides the advantage of it, it will enable him to take as much exerci&s;e in a couple of hours, as will &s;erve him for the day.&mdash;It is a wi&s;e provi&s;ion in the &s;tatutes of &s;ome mona&s;tic hou&s;es, to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ige their mem|bers to employ them&s;elves in manual labour during &s;o many hours in the four-and-twenty. Nothing can con|tribute more to give them &s;pirits, and rid them of the &s;pleen. I have heard,
<PB N="167" REF="167">
that the founder of the famous abbey of La Trappe, in pre&s;cribing this kind of di&s;cipline to his convent, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that as labour was origi|nally laid on man, as a puni&s;hment for &s;in, we may be a&s;&s;ured, it is one of the be&s;t means of keeping us out of it.</P>
<P>I admire his wi&s;dom, &s;aid I, in making the rules of his convent an antidote to the natural indolence of a cloi&s;ter. And I think our church, in giving the clergyman a glebe, hath had &s;omething of this kind in its eye. I &s;uppo&s;e you have no objection to
<PB N="168" REF="168">
his making the culture of it his amu&s;e|ment?</P>
<P>None, replied the Dean, if the &s;ell|ing of his corn, and hay do not lead him to bargain among low people at markets. I have no objection to <HI>any</HI> innocent rural employment. For my&s;elf, when I lived in the country, I had great plea&s;ure in all the&s;e things. I u&s;ed to &s;ee my hor&s;es, and cows foddered; u&s;ed to vi&s;it them in their pa&s;tures, and fed my poultry my&s;elf. But there are few circum&s;tances, in which I &s;hould advi&s;e a clergyman to gather his own tithe. It is an odious bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="169">I a&s;ked the Dean, if he had any objection to <HI>botany,</HI> as an inducement to draw us abroad?</P>
<P>Not the lea&s;t, &s;aid he, if it <HI>be</HI> an inducement&mdash;to me it would be none: though it is certainly very innocent; and, if I &s;hould judge from the num|bers who &s;tudy it, very intere&s;ting al&s;o. To examine the beauty and con&s;truction of plants&mdash;their infinite variety&mdash;and their &s;everal u&s;es, I can ea&s;ily conceive, might furni&s;h much rational amu&s;ement. But merely to give them hard names, when they already have ea&s;y ones; and to <HI>cla&s;s them botanically,</HI> which is in fact to
<PB N="170" REF="170">
cla&s;s them &s;o, that nobody, but a botani&s;t can find them out, appears to me &s;omething like writing an Engli&s;h grammar in Hebrew.

<P>I then a&s;ked the Dean, what he thought of bowls, tennis, and cricket, as clerical amu&s;ements?</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="171">With regard to bowls, &s;aid he, I am a party concerned, and therefore improperly called upon either as an advocate, or an evidence. I always liked a game at bowls, and thought it good exerci&s;e in a &s;ummer-evening. It is ju&s;t exerci&s;e enough to give the body a gentle breathing, without being too violent. With regard to tennis, and cricket, I mu&s;t be &s;ilent for ano|ther rea&s;on. I know nothing of either of them. To none of the&s;e exerci&s;es however I have any objection, if the party, which joins you in them, be well cho&s;en. It is this, which makes them innocent, or &s;educing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dean did not perhaps know, that there are few tennis-courts, which are not places of public re&s;ort.

<P>All that is nece&s;&s;ary, replied the Dean. For my own part, I know not what mental amu&s;ement men of
<PB N="173" REF="173">
&s;cience and information want, after a &s;tudious day, except that of con|ver&s;ing, with each other. Nothing gives the mind a more plea&s;ing relax|ation.

We are equally plea&s;ed with feeling our own &s;entiments corrected, (as it is done in a manner by our&s;elves) and with correcting the &s;entiments of others. The&s;e meetings among learned men, may be called the <HI>Fair of learning.</HI> They purcha&s;e commo|dities of each other. One man ex|changes
<PB N="174" REF="174">
changes his wit for another's know|ledge; and each probably gains what he wants, at the expence of &s;ome|thing, in which he abounds.&mdash;From this kind of communication too we get a variety of hints, which we may afterwards turn to u&s;e; and that with|out the fatigue of thinking; as other people think for us. I knew an in|genious man, who read little him&s;elf, but kept much good company; and had the art of picking up, and turn|ing to account, every thing he heard. By expanding the&s;e hints, and throw|ing beautiful lights, and images upon them, by the help of a good imagina|tion, he would write a &s;ermon, or an

e&s;&s;ay, which might be called entirely his own; though his friends, who lived much in the &s;ame company with him, could now and then di&s;|cover, how he came by his leading ideas.&mdash;I &s;hould not however advi&s;e any young man to &s;eek his knowledge in this vague way. It is a hundred to one, he is not qualified for it. Be|&s;ides, it is an indolent way, when you re&s;t &s;olely upon it. In his books he will always meet with in&s;truction.</P>
<P>If the plea&s;ure, &s;aid I, Sir, ari&s;ing from the company of learned men could be enjoyed in its full purity, it would indeed be a relaxation beyond

all others. Where tempers are well harmonized, I can conceive nothing more delightful. But as in chemical mixtures one &s;ingle heterogeneous in|gredient often puts the whole ma&s;s into a ferment; &s;o in the&s;e learned &s;ocieties, one man, who talks ince&s;|&s;antly, or di&s;putes eagerly, de&s;troys all the plea&s;ure of the meeting; and makes us think we might have em|ployed our time more happily with our own &s;olitary meditations. For my&s;elf, indeed I have &s;eldom mixed freely with any one &s;et of people, among whom &s;ome, or other has not been of this trouble&s;ome de&s;cription. At college I remember &s;everal &s;uch

<P>It is very true, an&s;wered the Dean, noi&s;y talking and eager di&s;puting are two great evils in conver&s;ation; and are often found, more or le&s;s, in the meetings even of learned, and inge|nious men. And it is a mi&s;erable thing, when a man's &s;elf is the only per&s;on plea&s;ed with hearing his own conver&s;ation. Nay, I will go farther, and allow that this is not the only evil, which infe&s;ts the&s;e &s;ocieties. There are other things, which often render them di&s;agreeable. A friend of mine told me lately, that
<PB N="178" REF="178">
in a capital town in England he was a member of a very reputable &s;ociety, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal men of ta&s;te, and &s;cience. He was delighted with their conver&s;ation, and thought his time very profitably &s;pent. He &s;oon, how|ever, found, that one, or two of the members of this &s;ociety had a dei&s;ti|cal turn. This might have been en|dured, if they would have kept their &s;entiments to them&s;elves, and di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed only points of literature. But they were forward, on all occa&s;ions, to move que&s;tions on religious &s;ub|jects; and would di&s;cu&s;s them with very offen&s;ive licence. My friend therefore &s;eeing no remedy, left his
<PB N="179" REF="179">
company, and con&s;orted no more with a &s;ociety, where he could not receive plea&s;ure without a great mix|ture of pain. And indeed I mu&s;t al|low with you, there are &s;o many things, which make the&s;e general meetings of literati di&s;agreeable, that I know not whether, as far as mere relaxation is concerned, one has not a better chance for it in the mixed com|pany of well-bred people of both &s;exes. I &s;hould at lea&s;t wi&s;h for no more than three or four, in a &s;ociety of &s;elect friends, to make it agree|able.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, Sir, there are many of
<PB N="180" REF="180">
us poor curates, who have few oppor|tunities of getting into company of any kind; who live in lonely places; and &s;ee few, be&s;ides the pea&s;ants of our own pari&s;hes: What re&s;ources have you for us?</P>
<P>Why, in the fir&s;t place, an&s;wered the Dean, the pea&s;ants of your pari&s;h are, in many re&s;pects, the propere&s;t company you can keep. You will not mingle with their plea&s;ures, and diver&s;ions. But the good pa&s;tor will often find lei&s;ure to enter their hou&s;es, and cottages; and &s;ee and hear what they are about: and in this duty he will find his amu&s;ement. On this
<PB N="181" REF="181">
head, however, I need not in&s;truct <HI>you.</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ides, added he, we are rather going from the que&s;tion. We are not con&s;idering amu&s;ement as united <HI>with</HI> duty; but as a relaxation <HI>from</HI> it.&mdash;Are you mu&s;ical? I know no amu&s;ement &s;o adapted to the clerical life, as mu&s;ick. And indeed not only as an amu&s;ement; but as a mean often, as Saul u&s;ed it, to drive away the evil &s;pirit. Sedentary men are &s;ubject to nervous complaints; and I have known many a man, who could, at any time, fiddle away a fit of the &s;pleen.</P>
<P>I am my&s;elf, &s;aid I, mu&s;ical enough,
<PB N="182" REF="182">
to have &s;ometimes felt the relief you mention, though I can, on no in&s;tru|ment, charm any ears, but my own.</P>
<P>And what other ears, replied the Dean, do you wi&s;h to charm? To tell you the truth, I &s;hould think ex|cellence rather a di&s;advantage. I have known &s;everal clergymen, who were ma&s;ters of mu&s;ick, get into di&s;|agreeable connections by being called on frequently to a&s;&s;i&s;t in concerts with people, whom it would have been more prudent to avoid.&mdash;We are willing indeed to &s;uppo&s;e, that mu|&s;ick makes a part of our heavenly enjoyments: but on earth, I am per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="183" REF="183">
it is &s;ometimes found among very unharmonized &s;ouls. It may drive away a fit of the &s;pleen, or mo|derate &s;ome momentary pa&s;&s;ion; but I fear it has not often much effect in meliorating the heart by &s;ubduing inordinate affections.&mdash;If, therefore, continued the Dean, you can fiddle &s;o as to amu&s;e your&s;elf, I &s;hould de&s;ire no more.</P>
<P>I hope then, &s;aid I, Sir, my acquire|ments in this art will not di&s;plea&s;e you; for they are very far from the point of excellence.&mdash;But I am chiefly &s;olicitous to have your opinion on a &s;till more favourite amu&s;ement, which
<PB N="184" REF="184">
is <HI>drawing.</HI> It has given agreeable employment to many a &s;olitary hour in my life, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to be debarred the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I have no intention, &s;aid the Dean, to debar you from it. But I mu&s;t give you one piece of advice. As you are fond both of mu&s;ick, and drawing, I &s;hould not wi&s;h you to practi&s;e both. One of the&s;e <HI>do|me&s;tic amu&s;ements,</HI> I &s;hould think, might find &s;ufficient employment for your lei&s;ure.&mdash;This piece of advice is from my&s;elf. But I am not un|qualified to give you other in&s;truction. I have no knowledge of the art my|&s;elf,
<PB N="185" REF="185">
but I remember hearing an ex|cellent judge give in&s;truction to a young man, who had a profe&s;&s;ion, as you have, and wi&s;hed to follow draw|ing, only as an amu&s;ement. In the fir&s;t place, I remember, he advi&s;ed his young friend again&s;t colouring, which all dabblers are fond of. To under&s;tand the harmony of colours, he &s;aid, required great experience; and without it, colouring was daubing. He advi&s;ed him al&s;o, I recollect, a|gain&s;t attempting hi&s;tory, or portrait, or animal life, or any other branch, in which <HI>accurate delineation</HI> was re|quired. Land&s;cape he recommended as the ea&s;ie&s;t, and mo&s;t plea&s;ing branch,
<PB N="186" REF="186">
which might have the farther advan|tage of decoying him into the fore&s;t, or the field, to examine, or copy na|ture.</P>
<P>I gave the Dean my be&s;t thanks for his advice. Of the utility of that part, which came from him&s;elf, I was already convinced by experience; and had determined to drop one of my amu&s;ements, as I found I could not, without too great an expence of time, follow both. With regard to the other part of his advice, I lamented, that it had never been given me be|fore. I owned I was a dabbler, and had daubed over many a &s;heet of
<PB N="187" REF="187">
paper. But if I continue, &s;aid I, to practi&s;e drawing, I &s;hall entirely lay a&s;ide my colours; and practi&s;e my art, &s;uch as it is, in a way, that may give me more &s;atisfaction: though perhaps, Sir, I &s;hall plea&s;e you better, by not aiming at any excellence at all.</P>
<P>If you allude, replied the Dean, to what I &s;aid about mu&s;ick, you mi&s;take my meaning. My great objection to your obtaining excel|lence in mu&s;ick, is, le&s;t it &s;hould mi&s;lead you into improper company. Its &s;i&s;ter art is of a more &s;olitary na|ture, and is not liable to that incon|venience. Except for this rea&s;on,
<PB N="188" REF="188">
and the fear of too much expence of time, I have no objection to your ob|taining excellence in both arts.&mdash;But though you &s;hould not be able to plea&s;e your&s;elf with your own profi|ciency in drawing; yet, if you have a ta&s;te for the art, you may be greatly amu&s;ed with the works of others. A clergyman near me, who is now dead, had a &s;mall collection of prints, and drawings; and when he was fatigued with &s;tudy (as he was a very &s;tudious man) could, at any time, amu&s;e him|&s;elf with a few of his prints.</P>
<P>But all this, &s;aid I, Sir, requires ta&s;te; and if a clergyman have no
<PB N="189" REF="189">
ta&s;te for the&s;e amu&s;ements, I hope you have no objection to indulge him in &s;ome amu&s;ement, which does not require it&mdash;in a game at che&s;s, for in&s;tance, with a neighbouring vi|car; or at back-gammon with the &s;quire?</P>
<P>In my opinion, &s;aid the Dean, che&s;s is &s;o far from being a relaxation, as all amu&s;ements &s;hould be, that, if you are fairly matched, it is a &s;evere &s;tudy. It is a game, in which a great variety of different movements create double the variety of different circum&s;tances; on each of which circum&s;tances, &s;o numerous a train of con&s;equences again depend, that to provide for all
<PB N="190" REF="190">
the contingences, that ari&s;e from your own moves, and may ari&s;e from the probable moves of your antagoni&s;t, requires a mind inten&s;ely occupied in the pur&s;uit before it, and vacant from every other. In &s;hort, a &s;kill in this game, like mathematical knowledge, may be continually advancing to per|fection. When I was Fellow of St. John's, I played much at che&s;s; and being fond of it, I attained, as I thought, &s;ome degree of excellence: till at length, from beating all the young men at Cambridge, who played with me, I began to think my&s;elf the be&s;t che&s;s-player in England. It happened, on a vi&s;it to a friend in London, that an old German officer
<PB N="191" REF="191">
made one of the party. After din|ner we went to different amu&s;ements, and it was propo&s;ed, that he and I &s;hould play a game at che&s;s, as we were both known to be che&s;s-players. I mode&s;tly threw my glove; but my heart beat with a full a&s;&s;urance of triumph. I &s;oon, however, perceived, that my antagoni&s;t opened his game in a manner, to which I had not been accu&s;tomed. This rou&s;ed all my attention. But while I was defending my&s;elf in one quarter (for I quickly found I had to act only on the defen|&s;ive) I received a &s;evere blow on ano|ther, which threw me into great con|fu&s;ion. And while I was endeavour|ing
<PB N="192" REF="192">
to recover my di&s;ordered affairs, the enemy broke in upon me, and &s;hamefully defeated me, without giv|ing me an opportunity of di&s;playing one in&s;tance of my prowe&s;s. I was convinced, however, that all this mi&s;|chief had befallen me from too great confidence, and an incautious manner of opening my game. I begged, therefore, another trial: but it ended in the &s;ame di&s;grace. My antagoni&s;t, by this time, was fully apprized what a hero he had to deal with; and ex|ulting in his &s;ucce&s;s, de&s;ired me to fix upon any chamber on the board I plea&s;ed, and u&s;e all my &s;trength merely to defend that &s;ingle po&s;t: he en|gaged
<PB N="193" REF="193">
to attack no other. But in &s;pite of all my endeavours, he gave me check-mate upon that very &s;pot. Nay, he did it repeatedly; for my &s;hame was now turned into admira|tion. I &s;at down therefore contented; and endeavoured to con&s;ole my&s;elf by forming the di&s;grace I had &s;uffered into a le&s;&s;on again&s;t pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>I cannot, in return, &s;aid I, Sir, tell you a &s;tory of my prowe&s;s at che&s;s; but, if you will give me leave, I will tell you one of my per&s;everance. I played a game with a gentleman at my own lodgings, and was victorious. You have taken me, &s;aid he, rather
<PB N="194" REF="194">
inopportunely to-day; but if you will be vacant on Thur&s;day, I &s;hall be this way, and will demand &s;atisfac|tion. Accordingly on Thur&s;day he came about eleven o'clock; and by the time we had played three games, two of which I had won, his hor&s;es came to the door. I cannot leave the mat|ter thus, &s;aid he; if you can &s;et any little matter before me, we will go on. Two games more were played, when in the mid&s;t of the third, a bit of roa&s;ted mutton appeared; and by the time it was cold, I had defeated him again. I was now four or five games before him. Our intercour&s;e there|fore with the mutton was &s;hort; and
<PB N="195" REF="195">
we went to work again. I was &s;till victorious, when the hor&s;es returned at &s;ix. This is provoking, &s;aid he, I cannot leave the matter thus. Can I have a bed at the inn? His orders to his &s;ervant now were, not to bring the hor&s;es till they were &s;ent for. This was a melancholy note to me, fatigued, as I was already, beyond mea&s;ure. However, as I was under &s;ome obligations to the gentleman, and in my own lodgings, I had no choice. The night ended late, and the morning began early. Breakfa&s;t came&mdash;the barber came&mdash;dinner came &mdash;all was negligently treated, except the main point. I &s;ighed inwardly,
<PB N="196" REF="196">
and hoped this vi&s;itation would now &s;oon have an end. It la&s;ted, how|ever, all that day; and I was &s;till two games before my antagoni&s;t; though I had played as carele&s;sly as I could, without di&s;covering my indifference. As the evening drew on, I ex|pected every moment to hear a me&s;&s;age &s;ent for the hor&s;es; I was &s;hocked with his telling me, we could not part on the&s;e unequal terms. As the next day was Saturday, and he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, he &s;aid, then fini&s;h, he would try his fortune once more. So we continued nailed to our board, till a late hour on Friday night; and began again before breakfa&s;t, on Sa|turday
<PB N="197" REF="197">
morning. Towards the clo&s;e of the day, our accounts differed in one game. But I was too complai|nant to di&s;pute the matter; &s;o the hor&s;es were &s;ent for, and I was deli|vered from &s;uch a trial of my patience, as I never before experienced.</P>
<P>Scarce any mi&s;chief happens to us, &s;aid the Dean, but we have the com|fort of thinking it might have been wor&s;e: and you were happy that your friend did not come to you on Monday, in&s;tead of Thur&s;day.&mdash;As it appears, however, from <HI>my</HI> &s;tory, how much time and pains are nece&s;|&s;ary to obtain excellence in this game;
<PB N="198" REF="198">
and from <HI>your</HI> &s;tory, how fa&s;cinating a game it is&mdash;it is worth while to con|&s;ider, how far it may be a proper amu&s;ement for a clergyman&mdash;and whether it really an&s;wers the end of an amu&s;ement by unbending the mind. If it only &s;ub&s;titute one &s;evere &s;tudy for another, it cannot certainly take the name of an amu&s;ement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Cowper, with his u&s;ual de&s;criptive talents,</L>

<L>As fixed as marble, with a forehead ridg'd</L>
<L>And furrowed into &s;torms, and with a hand</L>
<L>Trembling, as if eternity were hung</L>
<L>In balance on his conduct of a pin?</L></NOTE>. Let every one however judge for him&s;elf. I found it too intere&s;ting to be amu&s;|ing to me, and therefore in early life
<PB N="199" REF="199">
I left it off.&mdash;It is certainly, however, a noble game. It gives us an idea of war without its guilt. It gives us a ju&s;t idea too of common life&mdash;of the happy effects of prudent, and cautious &s;teps on one hand; and of the fatal mi&s;chief, which often attends even one fal&s;e &s;tep on the other.</P>
<P>I know not, &s;aid I, Sir, whether &s;uch games, as are made up of <HI>&s;kill,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="200">
and <HI>chance</HI> together, are not clo&s;er imitations of life. Our mo&s;t prudent plans are often defeated by events, which do not depend on our&s;elves, but ari&s;e from what we call <HI>chance:</HI> while an ill-dige&s;ted plan &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds without any aid from our own prudence. Games, therefore, con&s;i&s;ting partly of <HI>&s;kill,</HI> and partly of <HI>chance,</HI> &s;eem more to re&s;emble the cour&s;e of events in human life, than games of <HI>mere &s;kill,</HI> like <HI>che&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, replied the Dean, &s;uch games afford a ju&s;ter picture of the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of life: but I am &s;peak|ing of the <HI>conduct</HI> of it. Sometimes,
<PB N="201" REF="201">
it is true, we are ruined by unavoid|able calamity; but more often by our own mi&s;conduct: and it is this latter view of life, which che&s;s &s;o ju&s;tly re&s;embles.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, Sir, as you repudiate che&s;s from the li&s;t of your clerical amu&s;ements, becau&s;e of its <HI>intricacy,</HI> I hope, you will take back-gammon into favour, becau&s;e of its <HI>&s;implicity.</HI></P>
<P>Not into my favour truly, an&s;wered the Dean. I know too little of it to make it a favourite. I have no ob|jection, however, to it, but its &s;tupi|dity. Let tho&s;e play at it, who like
<PB N="202" REF="202">
it. It &s;eems to me a noi&s;y, rattling game, fit rather to conclude an even|ing after a fox-cha&s;e, than &s;uited to the ta&s;te of men of letters, and refine|ment.&mdash;But indeed I have a &s;ort of prejudice again&s;t back-gammon, as it contributed to ruin the fortunes of an excellent young man, with whom, in early life, I was intimate at college. He was related to a rich, old admiral; and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be his intended heir which he probably might have been, had not this &s;tupid game inter|vened. Back-gammon was the ad|miral's delight. He had no re&s;ources in him&s;elf. As to books, he hardly knew the top of a page from the bot|tom.
<PB N="203" REF="203">
Back-gammon was level to his genius. All his powers were cen|tered in this game. Three, or four hours after dinner; and half that time after &s;upper, he never failed to play; and all day long, if the weather did not permit him to go abroad. As the admiral was not a very plea&s;ing man, and be&s;ides rather penurious in his hou&s;e-keeping, his company was not much &s;ought after; and it fell to the unhappy lot of my friend to be his almo&s;t con&s;tant antagoni&s;t. Day after day&mdash;it was weary work. I re|member well his coming to me, one evening, much out of humour: "I have been playing with him, &s;aid he,
<PB N="204" REF="204">
at this &s;tupid game, from four this afternoon, till eight; and he had the con&s;cience, towards the clo&s;e of this heavy bu&s;ine&s;s, to look me full in the face, and cry, Cou&s;in, you play as if you were tired."&mdash;In &s;hort, my friend could not bear this mi&s;erable tre&s;pa&s;s upon his time, and began to make conditions. The admiral was not u&s;ed to controul, took the huff, blot|ted him out of his will, and cho&s;e a puppy for his heir, who was fit for nothing, but to play at back-gam|mon.</P>
<P>A liberal minded man, &s;aid I, Sir, is much to be pitied, when his inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="205" REF="205">
re&s;t, and his &s;entiment are thus at va|riance. Young as I am in life, I have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of it; but I have &s;eldom known, as on this occa&s;ion, &s;entiment prevail.&mdash;Upon the whole however, Sir, I think you are too har&s;h in your cen&s;ure of back-gam|mon. It is not &s;urely a game of deep contrivance; yet I think it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es variety enough to be amu&s;ing even to an enlightened mind, which wi&s;hes, during a &s;hort interval, to &s;u&s;pend its faculties, and enjoy the refre&s;hment of a little privation of &s;entiment. What has hurt this poor, harmle&s;s game, I believe, more than any thing el&s;e, is, its connection with tho&s;e
<PB N="206" REF="206">
wicked little cubes, called <HI>dice,</HI> which are employed in &s;o many villainous purpo&s;es, that every communication with them is &s;u&s;pected. One of our good bi&s;hops, I have heard, is fond of a game at back-gammon, when he can get &s;nug to it with his chaplain. But he &s;tands much in awe of his own &s;ervants, le&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, they &s;hould hear their ma&s;ter rattling <HI>dice.</HI> So he plays always on a table, lined with green baize, and throws his dice from lined boxes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is told of Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on of London; but as he lived after Dr. Stilling|fleet's time, I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame device has been practi&s;ed by other bi&s;hops.</NOTE>.</P>

For my&s;elf, I &s;ee no rea&s;on, why the bi&s;hop may not indulge him&s;elf in a game at back-gammon, without &s;cruple, if he like it.

the mi&s;chief.

In my Utopia therefore money &s;hall in no degree be connect|ed with amu&s;ement. Its proper place is the market, and there only it has concern.</P>
<P>Gaming, &s;aid I, Sir, no doubt, is a very &s;trange perver&s;ion of amu&s;ement:
<PB N="209" REF="209">
but is there any objection to a trifling &s;take, which is never felt, whether we win, or lo&s;e; and is in fact no <HI>object?</HI></P>
<P>What end then, &s;aid the Dean, does it an&s;wer?</P>
<P>Merely, I replied, to keep the at|tention a little awake.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t allow then, an&s;wered the Dean, that as far as it does keep the <HI>attention awake,</HI> &s;o far it is an <HI>ob|ject.</HI> The amu&s;ement it&s;elf, it &s;eems, cannot keep the <HI>attention awake;</HI> but wants a &s;timulative, the love of money, which makes you play with that care,
<PB N="210" REF="210">
and caution, which the amu&s;ement it|&s;elf could not do. And is this any thing el&s;e, my good friend, (twi&s;t, and analy&s;e it, as you plea&s;e,) but the &s;pirit of avarice? One man's <HI>atten|tion</HI> cannot be <HI>kept awake,</HI> as you phra&s;e it, without playing for a &s;hil|ling. Another man mu&s;t keep his <HI>attention awake</HI> with a pound. A third mu&s;t be enlivened by a &s;take of ten times as much; and &s;o on, till the attention of &s;ome people mu&s;t be <HI>kept awake</HI> by &s;taking a patrimony. You &s;ee then plainly, that if the &s;take be &s;o trifling, as to be no <HI>object,</HI> it can be no <HI>incentive;</HI> and if it be an object, it can only be &s;o, by your attachment to
<PB N="211" REF="211">
a &s;um of money; and what will you call that attachment, unle&s;s you re|&s;olve it, with me, into the &s;pirit of avarice?</P>
<P>But though in theory, &s;aid I, Sir, you may be able to lead it up to this &s;ource, it &s;eems, in fact, to be &s;o tri|fling, as not to come within any moral calculation.</P>
<P>I know the mathematician, replied the Dean, divides matter with &s;uch nicety, as to bring it to an invi&s;ible point. But I do not like to &s;ee mo|rals &s;o treated. Is the <HI>exce&s;s</HI> wrong? If it be, the <HI>approach</HI> cannot be right.

If the mind be <HI>at all</HI> infected with the &s;pirit of <HI>avarice,</HI> and the de&s;ire of pro|fiting by your neighbour's lo&s;s, it is &s;o far an <HI>approach.</HI> There are differ|ent degrees of vice, no doubt; but we are cautioned again&s;t breaking one of the <HI>lea&s;t commandments,</HI> as well as the greate&s;t. The good Chri&s;tian en|deavours to pre&s;erve his mind from the &s;malle&s;t taint; and the Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter thinks him&s;elf particularly bound to ab&s;tain from every <HI>appear|ance of evil.</HI>&mdash;In fine, I will not cavil with you, whether playing for money ari&s;es from avarice; but certainly the <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> cea&s;es, when it cannot it&s;elf produce its end; and <HI>what does pro|duce
<PB N="213" REF="213">
the end,</HI> becomes the leading principle. So that the point i&s;&s;ues here: if you choo&s;e &s;uch feeble amu&s;ements, as are really no amu&s;e|ments, without the aid of vicious &s;ti|mulatives&mdash;it becomes you to lay them a&s;ide; and &s;eek for &s;uch amu&s;e|ments, as are &s;imply &s;uch.</P>
<P>To be candid, I replied, I have nothing farther, Sir, to oppo&s;e. Vi|cious cu&s;tom, I fear, hath modified all our amu&s;ements, as well as every thing el&s;e; and hath driven them from their natural &s;implicity; connecting things with them, that have no rela|tion to them. I cannot but allow,
<PB N="214" REF="214">
with you, that amu&s;ements &s;hould be &s;imply &s;uch; and that if they connect them&s;elves with money, they &s;hould a&s;&s;ume another name.&mdash;I then put the Dean in mind, that he had yet fur|ni&s;hed us with no <HI>dome&s;tic amu&s;ement,</HI> that came under the name of <HI>exerci&s;e.</HI> Rainy weather, I ob&s;erved, might continue &s;o long, as to make a little motion nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;edentary man. Do you object to billiards?</P>
<P>Why no, &s;aid the Dean, not much. My own method, when I could not take exerci&s;e abroad, was to throw two or three doors open, and walk from one chamber to another, with a
<PB N="215" REF="215">
book, or &s;crap of paper in my hand, as I u&s;ed to do in the fields. But I do not pre&s;cribe my own example to others. As to billiards, they are &s;o unhappily connected with gaming, and bad company, that I have no great re&s;pect for the amu&s;ement&mdash;at lea&s;t as a clerical one. However, as the influence of this game, from its expen&s;ive apparatus, cannot be &s;o ex|tended as cards, I &s;hould not object to a clergyman's playing at it in a pri|vate family, and under the u&s;ual re|&s;triction of playing only with good company, and for no &s;take.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you, &s;aid I, Sir,
<PB N="216" REF="216">
for the liberty you have given me of indulging an amu&s;ement, which is a favourite one with me; and in which I am &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome &s;kill.</P>
<P>Nay then, replied the Dean, I know not whether I &s;hall not revoke the liberty I have given you. I am not fond of a clergyman's <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;kill</HI> in any game. Skill always implies a con&s;umption of time; and an eager|ne&s;s after an amu&s;ement, which I can|not approve.</P>
<P>But you have now, &s;aid I, Sir, given me &s;o much good in&s;truction, that,
<PB N="217" REF="217">
whatever I may have done, I hope never again either to employ my time in improving my &s;kill; or to u&s;e my &s;kill in mi&s;pending my time.&mdash;I then a&s;ked the Dean, if he had ever heard of the game of &s;huttlecock? or if he would laugh at me for mentioning it to him as good <HI>dome&s;tic exerci&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>Laugh at you! &s;aid the Dean; I know no game, that I value more. It has all the characters of the amu&s;e|ment, we want. It gives us good exerci&s;e&mdash;it makes us cheerful&mdash;and has no connection with our pockets: and if I may whi&s;per another truth in your ear, it does not require <HI>much &s;kill</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="218">
to learn. When my legs were in better order, I have &s;pent many a rainy half-hour with Sir Roger, at &s;huttlecock in his hall. The wor&s;t of it is, few par&s;onage hou&s;es have a room large enough for it; though perhaps the tithe-barn, if it be not better employed, may furni&s;h one.&mdash; I could &s;ay more in favour of &s;huttle|cock. You may play at it alone. It is al&s;o an exerci&s;e too violent to la&s;t long. We need not fear, as at bil|liards, to mi&s;pend a morning at it. &mdash;Laugh at you! &s;o far from it, that I re&s;pect the man, who invented &s;huttlecoek.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="219">I a&s;ked the Dean next, if he had any objection to &s;ome little handi|craft bu&s;ine&s;s, as <HI>dome&s;tic exerci&s;e</HI> for a clergyman? And I particulari&s;ed that of a carpenter, or a turner; both which, I &s;aid, were very well fitted to put the blood in motion.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, replied the Dean, I like them both. I have known very worthy clergymen good carpenters, and turners. I knew one, who had a &s;hop in his hou&s;e, and made his own tables and chairs. They were &s;ub|&s;tantial, and not ill-made; though he did not think them neat enough for his parlour, they did very well for his
<PB N="220" REF="220">
chambers, and &s;tudy. I knew another clergyman, added the Dean, and an exemplary man he was, who was an excellent turner. He u&s;ed to work in box, ebony, and ivory; and made a number of little, pretty conveniences both for him&s;elf, and his friends. In the colde&s;t weather, I have heard him &s;ay, he could put his whole frame in a glow by working his lathe.&mdash;Did not you &s;ee in the prints, that Mon&s;. Pa&s;cal, who died the other day, had retired, a few years ago, to the learned &s;eminary of Port-Royal, where he, and other eminent men made it a rule to intermix their &s;tudies with manual labour?</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="221">I told the Dean I had &s;een it; and that I rather wondered at the choice, which Pa&s;cal had made of his own em|ployment, which was that of making wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Aye, good man, &s;aid the Dean, he made them for the poor pea&s;ants in his neighbourhood; and I &s;hould be glad to give more than double their value for a pair of them to keep for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>I then mentioned book-binding to the Dean, as a clerical art.</P>
<P>Why, yes, &s;aid he, I think it is:
<PB N="222" REF="222">
but we &s;hould have introduced it ear|lier in our conver&s;ation, under the head of <HI>dome&s;tic amu&s;ement;</HI> it will hardly come under that of <HI>dome&s;tic exerci&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Well, have you any thing more to offer? You &s;ee, I am di&s;po&s;ed to allow my brethren every mode of amu&s;ement, and exerci&s;e, that is con|&s;i&s;tent with innocence, and propriety of manners; and I hope the range which may be taken within the&s;e bounds, will be thought fully &s;uffi|cient. If I have omitted any thing; or if you have any thing farther to propo&s;e, let me know.</P>
<P>I recollect nothing, &s;aid I, Sir, at
<PB N="223" REF="223">
pre&s;ent; and have only left to ex|pre&s;s my grateful obligations to you for what is pa&s;t. If any thing farther &s;hould occur, I &s;hall take the liberty, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, to propo&s;e it. In the mean time, I am perfectly &s;atisfied my&s;elf with the indulgence you have given me; and &s;hould think any of my brethren unrea&s;onable, who &s;hould de&s;ire more.</P>

<HI>our conver&s;ation la&s;ted three evenings, I had the more lei&s;ure to commit it to writing. The force of many of the Dean's expre&s;&s;ions, I fear, is injured in an account, which depended &s;o much on memory: but I dare take upon me to &s;ay, the &s;entiments are invariably his.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As this conver&s;ation gave a new turn to all my own amu&s;ements, it enabled me al&s;o to be of &s;ome &s;ervice in giving occa&s;ional advice to &s;everal of my younger brethren: and if my executors &s;hould find the&s;e papers, and think them worth communicating to the public, I &s;hould hope they might be of u&s;e al&s;o to others, after I am gone.</HI></P>
