<P>THE various unfore&s;een circum&s;tances, which have hitherto delayed the publica|tion of this work, the Author hopes, will apologize to his Sub&s;cribers when laid before them; and the acqui&s;ition of many valuable materials, which greatly enrich the Compilation, he flatters him&s;elf, will compen&s;ate the tre&s;pa&s;s committed on their patience.</P>
<P>A &s;hort account of the method pur&s;ued in this work &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate the value of tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts, which have lately been obtained.</P>
<P>ATTENTION to the mo&s;t di&s;tant antiquity, may appear to the learned Reader not &s;uf|ficiently engaging to detain him from tho&s;e Events, which are &s;trictly Provincial; yet the neglect of a general view of this County, in the earlie&s;t ages, would di&s;appoint others: Therefore, in the Introduction, I &s;hall in a cur&s;ory manner pay attention to tho&s;e times which preceed the acce&s;&s;ion of the ROMANS, and notice the conque&s;t made by them of the Province of BRIGANTIA, their departure, the calling in of the Saxons and found|ation of their Monarchy in Northumberland, with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Sovereigns in BERNICIA and DEIRA, until the union of tho&s;e States under OSWALD. In this peri|od, the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian Church in the Northern parts of Britain, &s;hall be noted, and the manners and cu&s;toms of the people de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THE work opens with the conver&s;ion of the Northumbrian Saxons, and the found|ation of the See of LINDISFARNE.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="14">IT would be u&s;ele&s;s to mention the various ancient authors, who&s;e labours furni&s;h ma|terials for this part of the work, or to recapitulate the many publications well known to the learned reader, which will be critically referred to, on every occa&s;ion through|out the whole. Soon after the Prelates were &s;ettled at LINDISFARNE, they appear to have taken a part in the affairs of Government, and indeed, the &s;ituation of Religious Societies was &s;uch in the infancy of Church E&s;tabli&s;hment, that on every convul&s;ion of State and revolution of Empire, they were in imminent peril; &s;o that it becomes indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in carrying on a hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of the See, to weave and mingle therewith the material events of State, more e&s;pecially where the Provincial injunctions and ordinances were a mixture of maxims Civil and Clerical. If it appears nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the affairs of Government in the early &s;tages of our Bi&s;hoprick, how much more important doth it &s;eem, when our Prelates held high Offices under the Crown, led forth the troops of their Province, were Emba&s;&s;adors making League and Truce, and when this Palatinate became a barrier between two ho&s;tile Nations, and often the &s;cene of battle. The&s;e are briefly noticed here, to account for interweaving &s;o much of the general hi&s;tory with the annals of our Prelates. The rehear&s;al of local Events mu&s;t be abrupt, and material facts unconnected and unplea&s;ant in the relation, if not carried on in a &s;hort &s;ucce&s;&s;ional line of circum&s;tances for their introduction, thereby rendering &s;uch Events more intere&s;ting to the Reader, and by enlarging the limits of Provincial hi&s;tory, giving a more plea&s;ing channel to the narrative. By this method, the reader will al&s;o be enabled to collect the traits of character which every Prelate di&s;played in his public or private Capacity, and to read the Man dive&s;ted of the robes of Pontificacy.</P>
<P>IT was not till after the Epi&s;copal &s;eat was at DURHAM, that we hear any thing of the Civil Juri&s;diction being ve&s;ted in the Prelates. WALCHER, who&s;e acce&s;&s;ion was in the year 1072, was the fir&s;t that wore that Imperial Mitre, which in after ages became &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, and with the Clerical character mixed the rights and privileges of a Sover|eign, thereby erecting an Engli&s;h Popedom. The ambitious BEKE in maintenance of his regal authority within this Province, touching forfeited E&s;tates, for which he contended with the Crown, alledged in Parliament, <HI>that the Bi&s;hops of Durham had from antient time all regal rights and Juri&s;diction within their Royal Liberty of Durham from the time of the Conque&s;t and antecedent thereto.</HI> <Q>This privilege is founded upon Pre&s;cription immemo|rial, becau&s;e there is no record of its being granted by any Princes before the Conque&s;t or &s;ince, wherein it is not &s;uppo&s;ed to have been granted al&s;o by their predece&s;&s;ors; it proceeded at fir&s;t from a principle of Devotion to St. CUTHBERT, that whatever Lands were given to him, or bought with his money, he &s;hould hold them with the &s;ame freedom that the Princes who gave them held the re&s;t of their E&s;tates; but this pi|ety to the Saint was not without its prudential purpo&s;es all along, both for the &s;ervice
<PB N="3" REF="15">of the Crown in the Wars with Scotland, and al&s;o for the &s;ervice of the Country, becau&s;e of its di&s;tance from the Courts of Law above.</Q></P>
<P>IN the Annals of Bi&s;hop WALCHER and his Succe&s;&s;ors, all the evidence obtained by laborious re&s;earch will be laid down, to define, of what the PALATINE power con&s;i&s;ted in the exerci&s;e of its authority, and into one point of view will be collected whatever our mo&s;t learned Writers have &s;aid concerning it. For as the regal juri&s;diction in this Province is alledged to be pre&s;criptive, it is from Writers of Antiquity only we can trace the original &s;en&s;e entertained of the authority of a PALATINE, and from &s;ucce&s;&s;ional acts coming into ages of learning and re&s;earch, that we can learn the real power of that &s;pecies of Juri&s;diction. It was an ancient maxim, <HI>Quidquid rex habet extra Commitatem Dunelmen&s;em, Epi&s;copus habet infra, ni&s;i aliqua &s;it conce&s;&s;io aut prae&s;criptio in contrarium.</HI></P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hops had great extent of power, as the &s;everal Records quoted in the cour&s;e of the work, under each Epi&s;copacy will evince. They levied taxes for the defence and &s;ervice of the Palatinate, and made truces with Enemies; rai&s;ed defen&s;ible troops within the liberty from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty years of age, and impre&s;&s;ed Ships for war; they &s;ate in judgment of life and death, and held execution by life and limb: They had power to create Barons, who formed their Council or Parliament, and with their Va&s;&s;als were bound to attend the Bi&s;hop's &s;ummons in time of public exigen|cy: The greate&s;t part of the Lands within the liberty were held of the Bi&s;hops as Lords Paramount, in Capite: They coined money, granted licences to embattle Ca&s;tles, build Churches, found Ho&s;pitals and Chantries; in&s;tituted Corporations by Charter, to which the Crown's a&s;&s;ent was not e&s;&s;ential to maintain their legality, and granted Fairs and Markets: They had all manner of Royal Juri&s;diction both Civil and Military, by Land and by Water; for the exerci&s;e whereof they held proper Courts, and appointed Officers and other Mini&s;ters of every department, as well &s;uch as the Crown nominates without the liberty, as tho&s;e the King had been u&s;ed to depute, according to the exi|gencies of &s;pecial ca&s;es, and for the Execution of Acts of Parliament. The Bi&s;hops Officers by Patent are, the Temporal Chancellor, Con&s;table of Durham Ca&s;tle, to whom belonged the care of the Levies, the cu&s;tody of the Armour and pay of the troops; the high Chamberlain, the under Chamberlain, Secretary of State, Steward, Trea&s;urer, Comptroller of the Hou&s;ehold, Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, Stewards of the Manors and Hal|mote Courts, Sheriff, Prothonotary, Clerks of the Chancery, Crown and Peace, Keeper of the Rolls, Cur&s;itor, Regi&s;ters and Examiners in Chancery, Clerk of the County Court, Stewards of Borough Courts, E&s;chaetors, Feodaries, Auditors and under Auditors, Clerks of the receipt of the Exchequer, Supervi&s;ors of Lord&s;hips, Ca&s;tles, Mines of Coal, Lead and Iron, Coroners, Con&s;ervators of Ports and Rivers, Officers of Mar&s;hal|&s;ea, Clerks of Markets, Keepers of the great Seal, of Ulnage, of the Wardrobe and
<PB N="4" REF="16">Harne&s;s, and Ma&s;ter Armourer. They had &s;everal Fore&s;ts, Chaces, Parks and Woods, where they had their Fore&s;ters, who held Courts in their name, and determined mat|ters relative to Fore&s;ts, Parks, Rangers and Palekeepers. They were Lord high Admirals of the Sea and Waters, that lie within or adjoining the County Palatine, had Vice Admi|rals and Courts of Admiralty, Judges to determine according to the Maritime Laws, Re|gi&s;ters, Examiners, Officers of Beaconage, Anchorage, &amp;c. and awarded Commi&s;&s;ions, to regulate Waters and pa&s;&s;ages thereon. <Q>Thus by them&s;elves and Officers, they did Ju&s;tice to all per&s;ons, in all ca&s;es, without either the King or any of his Officers inter|fering ordinarily in any thing. Whatever occa&s;ion the King had within this liberty, his Writs did not run here, they were not directed as to his own Officers in other Counties, but to the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, or in the Vacancy of the See, to the proper Offi|cers of the Palatinate. When King Henry the II. &s;ent his Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize hither upon an extraordinary occa&s;ion of Murders and Robberies, he declared by his Char|ter, that he did it with the licence of the Bi&s;hop, <HI>et pro hac vice tantum;</HI> and that it &s;hould not be drawn into cu&s;tom either in his time, or in the time of his heirs, not being done but upon ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; and that he would, neverthele&s;s, have the Lands of Saint Cuthbert to enjoy its Liberties and antient Cu&s;toms as amply as ever.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not 'till after WILLIAM DE CARILEPHO's acce&s;&s;ion to the See in 1080, that the regal rights of our Prelates received confirmation in writing from the Crown: After the coming in of the NORMANS, Deeds and Writings under Seal gained general acceptation, and every material tran&s;action was conducted under written muniments: Proceeding that aera, mo&s;t of the public Records were only entries <HI>in te&s;timonium,</HI> atte&s;t|ed by the parties pre&s;ent, as Regi&s;ters of the fact, who thereto &s;ub&s;cribed their names under the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, and from that important period in our Provincial Hi&s;tory, the long &s;eries of Records, to which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to refer, will appear.</P>
<P>THE Work will con&s;i&s;t of <HI>two</HI> Volumes. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> comprehends the Annals of the Bi&s;hops with their &s;everal acts of Juri&s;diction, embelli&s;hed with many Portraits, Seals, Coins, Arms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> comprehends local de&s;criptions, with the peculiar hi&s;tory of each part of the County, thrown into Parochial divi&s;ions. The CITY of DURHAM is treated of at large, and in progre&s;&s;ive order the Charters of Incorporation are in&s;erted, particularly the new one granted by the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop. In this arrangement of City records, is a <HI>fac &s;imile</HI> of Bi&s;hop PUDSEY's Charter, with the Pope's confirmatory Bull, a Plate pre|&s;ented by Mr. G. ALLAN, and engraved by that incomparable arti&s;t <HI>Stephens;</HI> by who&s;e death the Author hath lo&s;t a great a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and the public one of the mo&s;t accurate workmen of the age. Under this head, li&s;ts of the chief Magi&s;trates of the City, and Repre&s;entatives in Parliament will be in&s;erted. Great attention is paid to the hi&s;tory
<PB N="5" REF="17">of the Cathedral, which is embelli&s;hed with two correct draughts and admea&s;urements of the North and Ea&s;t fronts, by an eminent Architect employed in the pre&s;ent co&s;tly repairs now carrying on; and each part thereof and other Mona&s;tic buildings de&s;cri|bed, with a comparative view of their antient magnificence and pre&s;ent &s;tate. Short anecdotes of the Priors, Deans, Prebendaries, and other Mini&s;ters, with hi&s;torical notes and Monumental In&s;criptions will be in&s;erted. The Endowment by K. Hen. VIII. will be given at length, with the Statutes and other Muniments; to which are added a number of Records hitherto with-held from the public: In like manner the Author pa&s;&s;es through every other public building and place of con&s;equence, and throws in Engravings of all the remains of Antiquity, Ca&s;tles, and principal Seats, &s;ome of which have been contributed as an encouragement to the work, by the late JOHN CUTHBERT <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> JOHN TEMPEST and TIMOTHY HUTCHINSON E&s;quires, MR. ALLAN and others.</P>
<P>As the Author proceeds in Parochial Divi&s;ions, he takes for his guide the Book of Rates, made for collecting the Royal Aid under the Satutes of 16 and 17 of Charles II. Each Pari&s;h Church is de&s;cribed, and engravings given of the mo&s;t remarkable; due attention is paid to things memorable recorded in the Regi&s;ters, and Monumental In|&s;criptions; and the &s;uppo&s;ed value of each Living &s;hewn, and the Incumbents in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion thrown into the notes. Under this divi&s;ion, every thing remarkable in Anti|quity or rare in nature is treated of, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ingular monuments repre|&s;ented. The foundations and privileges of each religious Hou&s;e, Ho&s;pital, Gild and Chantry are &s;et forth, with engravings of all the Seals extant.</P>
<P>ALL Gentlemens Seats are de&s;cribed and antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors noted, with Genealogical Tables, not only of the principal Families exi&s;ting, but &s;uch as are extinct, and were once of con&s;equence in the County, together with tran&s;cripts of Vi&s;itations in the Libra|ries of JOHN TEMPEST and MARMADUKE TUNSTALL E&s;quires, who&s;e liberality demands every grateful acknowledgment. The&s;e are compleated by the additions of Mr. ALLAN, who&s;e indefatigable labour has accumulated mo&s;t of the materials, from which this work is compiled, and from who&s;e unexampled bounty and genero&s;ity they are &s;ub|mitted to the author's arrangement for the public Eye.</P>
<P>A &s;hort account of the STAPLES of this County will be pre&s;ented, its Trade and Manufacturies, with the Imports and Exports: Comparative tables from the Church Regi&s;ters for 20 years of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent Century are in&s;erted, to &s;hew the &s;tate of Population, communicated by the re&s;pective Clergy, who&s;e attention hereto has been &s;ingularly kind.</P>
<P>A cur&s;ory view of the NATURAL HISTORY of each di&s;trict is introduced, with de|lineations of &s;uch productions as are curious, and a &s;hort account of the STRATA found in the Mines, with drawings and admea&s;urements from the works.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="18">PROGRESSIVE ob&s;ervations will be made as the Itinerary advances, on AGRICULTURE, produce of the Lands, growth of Timber, and breeds of Cattle, with other matters equally intere&s;ting to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>HAVING given a cur&s;ory view of the manner in which this Work will be executed, the MATERIALS from whence it is chiefly compiled, &s;hall next be noticed; and this the Author is more particularly induced to do, as, &s;ince his propo&s;als were offered, a publication has appeared from the Clarendon Pre&s;s, intitled <HI>Collectanea Curio&s;a</HI> taken from the Manu&s;cripts of Archbi&s;hop SANCROFT in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library, wherein is a compendious arrangement of Materials nece&s;&s;ary for con&s;tructing a work like this.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Record noted, is, the Doom&s;day Book of this County, called BOLDON BUKE, from the Survey which it contains, having reference in many Lord&s;hips to the Manor of <HI>Boldon,</HI> touching the &s;ervices of the Tenants, <HI>"&s;icut in Boldon".</HI> The Editor gives &s;everal Extracts, which he &s;ays were collated with the tran&s;cript, lodged in the Bodleian Library
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gough's Anecdotes of Briti&s;h Topography V. 1. p. 336.</NOTE>. The Original Survey is depo&s;ited in the Auditors Office at Durham, and bound up with a &s;ucceeding Survey made by order of Bi&s;hop Hatfield. It is wrote on Vellum, and thus indor&s;ed. "<HI>Supervi&s;us temp. Hugonis Epi.</HI> 1183, <HI>et Supervi&s;us temp. Thome Hatfeld Epi'.</HI> The fir&s;t is wrote in a compact hand and contained in 24 pages; the latter in a loo&s;er hand of 187 pages, and more comprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>IT was not till after Propo&s;als were offered to the public, that the&s;e Records were obtained, and they are introduced through the work, as they appertain to the place de|&s;cribed, thereby rendering them le&s;s tedious to the Eye, and much readier in applica|tion than in an Appendix: This required much labour and attention to execute, and nece&s;&s;arily has delayed the Publication.</P>
<P>THAT laborious Collector of Records the Rev. Mr. THOMAS RANDALL, late Ma&s;ter of the Grammer School in Durham, employed the lei&s;ure of his whole life in &s;earching the &s;everal Repo&s;itories there, and I have before me fifteen large Volumes in Manu&s;cript, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 300 pages each, copied therefrom with that accuracy, for which he was &s;ingular.</P>
<P>IN the Chapter Trea&s;ury and Library, it is &s;aid, there are above ninety Royal Charters and Grants, above fifty Deeds by Nobles and Barons, about 266 by Gentlemen, 131 by Popes, Bi&s;hops, Abbots, Priors, Convents and other Religious Per&s;ons and Hou|&s;es, and above 130 other Original Deeds and Copies, which will amount in all to about 670. In Mr. Randall's Collection are Copies of all the Grants, Conventions and other In&s;truments that are curious, and entered in the Chartularies of the Chapter, not only from his own in&s;pection, but gathered from the labours of Dr. Hunter and
<PB N="7" REF="19">Mr. Gabriel Swain&s;ton, who&s;e amu&s;ements led that way. The&s;e Volumes al&s;o contain extracts from the Copyhold Books of the Bi&s;hop, copies of a &s;eries of the clo&s;e Rolls of the Chancery, minutes of the Vi&s;itation Books and Regi&s;ters of all the Prelates &amp;c. Al&s;o two large folios of the Inqui&s;itions po&s;t mortem taken before the Bi&s;hop's Sheriffs and E&s;chaetors, within the liberties of Durham and Sadberge, and another of the Wills of &s;uch Per&s;ons as have founded public Charities; and other matters equally important to a Work of this kind. All this Fund was bequeathed by Mr. Randall's Will to Mr. Allan, and is part of his Collection opened for my u&s;e: The materials were unarranged and without Index, &s;o that tho' the Trea&s;ure was great, the labour of dige&s;ting was infinite.</P>
<P>MR. SPEARMAN made Collections in an unfortunate di&s;pute with the then Prelate (CREWE) and publi&s;hed a &s;mall tract in quarto, intitled, "<HI>An Enquiry into the antient and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the County Palatine of Durham &amp;c.</HI> 1729", and therein referred to all &s;uch records as he had received information from: Tho&s;e noticed, were in&s;pected, and notes taken thereof at Bi&s;hop CREWE's in&s;tance, an original Manu&s;cript whereof, is dated 21 February 1697, mutilated by Spearman's publication, but apparently the Manu&s;cript to which he was indebted: His other Papers fell into hands di&s;intere&s;ted in matters of that kind, and as &s;aid, are lo&s;t. The late THOMAS GYLL <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Durham, has remarked in writing, <Q>that mo&s;t, or all of this Gentleman's Papers came to the hands of <HI>Gilbert Spearman</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who by Will dated 14 October 1736, bequeathed them to his Son <HI>George Spearman,</HI> and de&s;ired, that &s;uch parts, relating to the Coun|ty Palatine of Durham, as were thought proper, might be publi&s;hed, and earne&s;tly recommended to his Son, not to make them his &s;tudy but his diver&s;ion; which I am verily per&s;uaded <HI>George</HI> out of filial duty did mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve,</Q> and the fact proved &s;o, for he &s;uffered them to be wa&s;ted and thrown away. Tho' the late Mr. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> of Witton informed Mr. <HI>Allan,</HI> that he knew where many of the&s;e MSS. were, and promi&s;ed to procure them for his u&s;e, when he got up to London, but unfortu|nately he died on the Road thither.</P>
<P>MR. MICKLETON's Papers were more fortunate; he had made con&s;iderable Collec|tions, and Mr. Randall laments their imagined lo&s;s (as he never &s;aw them) in the&s;e words; <Q>Mr. Mickleton, a Coun&s;ellor at Law in Durham had collected &s;ome Evidences touching the Palatinate, and his Executors &s;old his Papers to Mr. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> &s;o that they are lo&s;t to the public, &s;ave what appears in Mr. <HI>Spearman's</HI> Book.</Q></P>
<P>JOHN RUDD <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Durham, an eminent Coun&s;ellor at Law, had an in&s;pection there|of, and happily thought them of &s;ufficient importance to make full extracts of every material matter therein, and gives the following account thereof.</P>

<P>WILLIAM RUDD <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> has lately been plea&s;ed to open the trea&s;ures of his Library: The eminence that family held at the Bar, gives the greate&s;t importance to their col|lections. From this channel, the Author has received two Volumes of a compleat &s;eri|es of Extracts from the Cur&s;itors Rolls, and in three folios, innumerable copies of Char|ters, Grants and other public In&s;truments, together with Mickleton's Collections, which, it is not doubted, will amply apologize for the delays that have hitherto befallen this intended Publication.</P>
<P><Q>BREVITTS, tho' of no authority in point of evidence, yet for information are often u&s;eful, di&s;covering what &s;uites have formerly depended, directing to the Records, and often explaining their meaning, and giving us the &s;everal pleadings and proceedings therein, with the be&s;t di&s;covery of the merit and my&s;tery of the cau&s;e. The Attor|neys or Sollicitors who keep the&s;e Brevitts after the Cau&s;es are determined, are the per&s;ons capable of &s;upplying us; particularly tho&s;e of the greate&s;t bufine&s;s, they hav|ing mo&s;t of them

<P>CONSIDERABLE a&s;&s;i&s;tance has likewi&s;e been received from Mr. ROBERT HARRISON of Durham, and Mr. JOSEPH RITSON of Grays Inn London, who&s;e re&s;earches, in the Harleian and Cottonian Libraries, have furni&s;hed &s;everal valuable tran&s;cripts, e&s;pecially an hi&s;torical Poem on the Battle of Durham fought October 1346, known by the title of the <HI>Battle at Nevill's Cro&s;s</HI> which will be in&s;erted at full length.</P>
<P>IN a valuable Manu&s;cript communicated by Sir JOHN LAWSON, many particulars are recorded of the Riches, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church at Durham: And in a long Paper Roll about five inches broad, written in a clear antient hand, communi|cated by JOHN HOGG <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Norton, is di&s;covered the original perhaps, or at lea&s;t the whole contents of DAVIES'S RITES, and from which the 105th. page of the COLLECTANEA CURIOSA is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>W. H. MILBOURNE <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Armathwate Ca&s;tle in Cumberland, JOHN LAWSON MAIRE <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Lartington in York&s;hire, and many other Gentlemen, have al&s;o favoured me with &s;ome Manu&s;cripts from their repective Libraries.</P>
<P>THE evidences of &s;everal private families have been in&s;pected, and every thing intere&s;ting to the public carefully extracted.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this account of my materials, I &s;hould be unpardonable were I to omit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my kind friend Mr. ALLAN, who&s;e Library has been generou&s;ly laid open to me, together with the u&s;e of five large Manu&s;cript Volumes of the Parochial hi&s;tory, arranged and dige&s;ted by him&s;elf; be&s;ides innumerable collections from vari|ous authorities and records, with Charters, Seals, Coins, and other Antiquities. It is to his bounty that the work will be embelli&s;hed with many curious and valuable Plates, Pedigrees of families &amp;c:</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="22">SUCH Materials, like gems in the hand of the jeweller, cannot lo&s;e their intrin&s;ic value, in their pre&s;ent arrangement. And if the following work &s;hould be con&s;idered as little better than a mere repo&s;itory, by means of which a more happy Compiler may di&s;play them in a more judicious manner, I &s;hall have a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in having been the humble and laborious in&s;trument in collecting the Materials of his nobler edifice.</P>
