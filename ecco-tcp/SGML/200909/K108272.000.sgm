<HEAD>THE LAW OF LIBERTY, OR, ROYAL LAW.</HEAD>
<P>IN two former Tracts I have attempted to de&s;cribe the JUST LIMITATION OF SLAVERY IN THE LAWS OF GOD, and THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, with re&s;pect more particularly to the due SUBMISSION of <HI>Chri&s;tian Servants</HI> or <HI>Slaves</HI> to their <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent Tract is not only to point out the reciprocal duty of <HI>Chri&s;tian Ma&s;ters</HI> to their <HI>Servants,</HI> and all other per&s;ons with whom they are connected, but al&s;o more particularly
<PB N="6" REF="4">to enable our <HI>Briti&s;h American</HI> Slave|holders to examine or <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> (with very little trouble) by <HI>the Rule</HI> of God's Holy Word, <HI>the Legality</HI> or <HI>Illegality of Slavery among Chri&s;tians.</HI> For this pur|po&s;e &s;ome of the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial <HI>Maxims</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> of Scripture are &s;elected and compared with each other in the following pages.</P>
<P><Q><HI>So &s;peak ye, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be</HI> JUDGED <HI>by</HI> THE LAW OF LIBERTY.</Q></P>
<P>This the earne&s;t advice of the Apo&s;tle James in his General Epi&s;tle; (ii. 12.) and as it is therefore manife&s;t that we &s;hall certainly BE JUDGED by <Q>THE LAW OF LIBERTY,</Q> it becomes a bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance to a&s;certain what particular Law is thereby to be under&s;tood, that we may <HI>write it on our hearts,</HI> &s;ince our everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="5">depends upon it, and the peril of eternal damnation &s;eems to attend a breach of it; <Q><HI>for he &s;hall have</HI> JUDG|MENT WITHOUT MERCY</Q> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle in the following ver&s;e) <Q><HI>who hath &s;hewed</HI> NO MERCY!</Q> The ne|ce&s;&s;ary premi&s;es for the examination of the que&s;tion are nothing le&s;s than the fundamental moral Principles of Chri|&s;tianity; and if I am rather prolix in defining them, I hope <HI>the importance of the &s;ubject</HI> will be con&s;idered as a &s;uffi|cient excu&s;e; for indeed <HI>the &s;ubject</HI> is not only <HI>important</HI> to tho&s;e per&s;ons for who&s;e u&s;e this Tract is particularly in|tended (<HI>I mean tho&s;e per&s;ons who de&s;ire to be &s;atisfied concerning</HI> THE LEGALITY <HI>or</HI> ILLEGALITY OF SLAVERY AMONG CHRISTIANS) but to all Mankind be|&s;ides of every rank and denomination.</P>
<P>All the moral duties of the Go&s;pel are briefly comprehended in <HI>two &s;ingle
<PB N="8" REF="6">Principles</HI> of the Law of Mo&s;es, viz. THE LOVE OF GOD, and THE LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. Nothing, therefore, can be e&s;teemed truly <HI>lawful</HI> under the Go&s;pel, that is, in the lea&s;t, repugnant to either of the&s;e; and we need never be at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h what is, or what is not &s;o, if we will but carefully con&s;i|der the proportion or degree of <HI>that Love,</HI> which is clearly expre&s;&s;ed to be <HI>due,</HI> both to <HI>God</HI> and our <HI>Neighbour</HI> in the&s;e two comprehen&s;ive and eternal maxims. The degree of <HI>Love due to God</HI> exceeds all compari&s;on or con&s;ideration of other things; for it mu&s;t (&s;ays the text) be "<HI>with</HI> ALL <HI>thy heart, and with</HI> <Q>ALL <HI>thy &s;oul, and with</HI> ALL <HI>thy might.</HI></Q> (Deut. vi. 5.) which nece&s;&s;arily implies a mo&s;t fervent zeal for the glory of GOD, far exceeding all worldly con&s;iderations. And with re&s;pect to the degree or true proportion of <HI>Love due to our Neighbour,</HI> we have no pretence to plead ignorance,
<PB N="9" REF="7">&s;ince the appointed <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of it is con|tained in <HI>every Man's Brea&s;t</HI>&mdash;<Q>THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</Q> (Lev. xix. 18.) <Q><HI>On the&s;e two Commandments</HI></Q> (&s;aid the Eternal Judge) <Q><HI>hang</HI> ALL THE LAW <HI>and</HI> THE PROPHETS.</Q> (Mat. 22.40.) The &s;ame Eternal Judge of Mankind made al&s;o, on another occa&s;ion, a &s;imilar declaration concerning the <HI>Sum or Com|pendium</HI> <Q>OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>All things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you</HI></Q> (&s;aid he) <Q><HI>do ye even &s;o to them; for this is</HI> THE LAW AND THE PRO|PHETS.</Q> (Matth. vii. 12.) This mo&s;t excellent rule of conduct and be|haviour towards <HI>our Neighbours,</HI> which includes the whole Sub&s;tance or Spirit of "THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS," &s;o perfectly corre&s;ponds with the &s;econd great Commandment, to LOVE <HI>our Neigh|bours as our&s;elves</HI> (viz. to manife&s;t our
<PB N="10" REF="8">LOVE, <HI>by</HI> DOING <HI>to them, as we our&s;elves might</HI> WITH REASON AND JUSTICE <HI>expect and de&s;ire</HI> THEY WOULD DO UNTO US) that it &s;eems intended like a &s;ort of paraphra&s;e to explain the true tenour of it; for though the mode of expre&s;&s;ion is different, yet the effect of the doctrine is undoubtedly the &s;ame; becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle Paul has in like manner declared this &s;econd great Commandment to be <HI>the Compendium of "all the Law."</HI> <Q><HI>All the Law</HI></Q> (&s;ays he) <Q><HI>is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou &s;halt</HI> LOVE <HI>thy Neighbour</HI> AS THYSELF.</Q> (Gal. v. 14.</P>
<P>SELF-LOVE, therefore, mu&s;t be the RULE or MEASURE (not of Self-grati|fication, or private Intere&s;t, but) <HI>of our Conduct and Behaviour towards other Men!</HI> It mu&s;t not be SOLE TENANT of the heart; but is always to leave <HI>equal</HI> room for a due balance of <HI>that Love which we
<PB N="11" REF="9">owe to our Neighbour,</HI> whenever the pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances (whatever they may be) require a con&s;cientious regard to the <HI>publick Good,</HI> or a &s;ympathetick con&s;ide|ration for <HI>the Feelings and Sufferings of Individuals,</HI> to enable us to fulfil <HI>our Duty to our Neighbour.</HI> SELF-LOVE is not hereby <HI>excluded;</HI> for <HI>Self-pre&s;erva|tion,</HI> and a prudent regard for our own &s;upport and happine&s;s, may &s;till be al|lowed an <HI>equal Share</HI> of our con&s;idera|tion, without a Breach of <HI>this &s;econd great Commandment,</HI> which would otherwi&s;e be too hard and difficult for <HI>Human Nature</HI> to receive: we are not commanded there|in to love our Neighbours MORE <HI>than our&s;elves,</HI> but only (<GAP DESC="foreign">) AS <HI>our&s;elves;</HI> &s;o that SELF-LOVE is apparently the <HI>true Mea&s;ure of our Conduct and Behaviour to|wards other Men:</HI> and though an exalted Sen&s;e of <HI>Duty to God</HI> (according to the <HI>fir&s;t great Commandment</HI>) may, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, prompt Men to noble
<PB N="12" REF="10">actions, wherein SELF-LOVE may &s;eem to be lo&s;t in a generous and benevolent regard to others (of which there are &s;everal in&s;tances in Scripture, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) See my Tract on <HI>the Law of Nature, and Principles of Action in Man.</HI> P. 79&mdash;105.</NOTE>; and al&s;o though the like admirable genero&s;ity and perfect di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s may, po&s;&s;ibly, upon &s;ome unfore&s;een occa&s;ion, become likewi&s;e the peculiar duty of any one of us, viz. <Q><HI>to lay down</HI> (our) <HI>Lives for the Bre|thren</HI>
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>(2) <HI>Hereby perceive we</HI> (or rather, it &s;hould be ren|dered, <HI>Hereby have we perceived</HI>) <Q><HI>the</HI> LOVE (of God), <HI>becau&s;e he laid down his Life for us</HI></Q> (&s;aid the Apo&s;tle, and then he immediately informs us of the duty which ari&s;es from that extraordinary manife&s;tation of LOVE) <Q>AND WE OUGHT (&s;ays he) TO LAY DOWN (our) LIVES FOR THE BRETHREN.</Q> 1 John iii. 16. This plain declaration of our duty (<GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. "WE OUGHT <HI>to lay down our Lives,</HI>" &amp;c.) &s;ufficiently enables us to account for the many extraordinary examples of SELF-LOVE <HI>being &s;uper&s;eded by more noble Principles,</HI> &s;ome of which I have cited in my Tract on <HI>the Law of Nature, and Principles of Action in Man,</HI> p. 79&mdash;105, to which al&s;o the following may be added.</P>
<P>THE GRATITUDE of the <HI>Galatians</HI> to their Teacher <HI>Paul,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed by that Apo&s;tle in the &s;tronge&s;t terms&mdash;<Q><HI>I bear you record</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that if it had been po&s;&s;ible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</HI></Q> Gal. iv. 15.</P>
<P>Not inferior to this was the LOVE of that &s;ame Apo&s;tle him&s;elf towards <HI>the Corinthians,</HI> though they were &s;o far from returning a <HI>mutual affection</HI> like <HI>the Galatians,</HI> that the Apo&s;tle, it &s;eems, had rea&s;on to complain of their INGRATITUDE&mdash;<Q><HI>I will very gladly</HI> SPEND, AND BE SPENT <HI>for you</HI> (literally <HI>"for your Souls,"</HI> &s;aid he) <HI>though the more abundantly I</HI> LOVE <HI>you, the le&s;s I be</HI> LOVED.</Q> 2 Cor. xii. 15.</P>
<P>To "SPEND, AND BE SPENT" for others, and that <HI>"very gladly!"</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> LOVE that could have been cho&s;en! It implies a chearful &s;acrifice of every thing that is dear in this world (LIFE ITSELF NOT EXCEPTED!) <Q><HI>and greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his friends.</HI></Q> John xv. 13. So that, as <HI>no Man can have greater Love than this,</HI> we may certainly e&s;teem it the highe&s;t demon&s;tration of <HI>"perfect Love;"</HI> and as the &s;en|tence la&s;t quoted from the Apo&s;tle John relates, in its pri|mary application, to the voluntary &s;acrifice which Chri&s;t made of him&s;elf to &s;ave Mankind, it leads us to the true foundation of that <HI>"perfect Love"</HI> enjoined in the Scrip|tures, which (as the preceding examples demon&s;trate) does occa&s;ionally overcome the general Principle of <Q><HI>Self-love,</HI></Q> and every other <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> Motive natural to "MAN!</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle John informs us, no le&s;s than <HI>twice</HI> in <HI>one</HI> chapter, that "GOD IS LOVE!" (<GAP DESC="foreign">. 1 John iv. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign">. ibid. v. 16.)</P>
<P>This information is introduced in an argument, whereby the Apo&s;tle endeavours to inculcate a due &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity we are laid under, <HI>to love one another,</HI> becau&s;e GOD hath fir&s;t <HI>loved us:</HI> &s;o that GRATITUDE TO GOD mu&s;t be the foundation of our <HI>"Love to one another;"</HI> and we are therefore bound to imitate (and will certainly endeavour to imitate, if "GOD DWELLETH IN US." See 1 John iv. 13.16.) that glorious Attribute of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> LOVE ("GOD IS LOVE") which he has manife&s;ted towards us, by &s;acrificing all that could be <HI>truly perfect</HI> and <HI>dear</HI> in his &s;ight, even his only begotten Son, who al&s;o <HI>voluntarily &s;ubmitted him&s;elf</HI> (for our happine&s;s and <HI>eternal</HI> welfare) to the mo&s;t &s;evere <HI>temporal</HI> &s;ufferings, and trials, <HI>even unto death!</HI></P>
<P>TO GOD, and to the ETERNAL WORD, therefore, (to whom we are indebted, not only for that extraordinary manife&s;tation of LOVE, but for all other things that we enjoy, even for our very exi&s;tence) our return of LOVE, mu&s;t be UNLIMITED; and the <HI>natural Principle</HI> of SELF-LOVE, which is given as the mea&s;ure of our LOVE <HI>to our Neighbour</HI> in the <HI>Law of Liberty,</HI> or <HI>&s;econd great Command|ment,</HI> mu&s;t be entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed whenever it falls in com|petition with <HI>the Love of God</HI> enjoined in the <HI>fir&s;t great Commandment;</HI> and though this doctrine is very hard and difficult to be received, and much more difficult to be practi&s;ed, as it includes the mo&s;t exalted <HI>Heroi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Greatne&s;s of Soul</HI> that Human Nature is capable of attain|ing, yet we have ample rea&s;on to hope and tru&s;t (as the di&s;charge of our <HI>Duty to our Neighbour</HI> includes and fulfils the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of <HI>our Duty to God</HI>) that tho&s;e men, who carefully endeavour to make <HI>"the Law of Liberty,"</HI> (I mean <HI>the &s;econd great Commandment</HI>) their <HI>general</HI> or <HI>ordinary</HI> Rule of Conduct IN LIFE, will not want due a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Almighty to enable them to fulfil al&s;o the duty which ari&s;es from <HI>the fir&s;t great Commandment,</HI> even UNTO DEATH, if any extraordinary emergency &s;hould require &s;uch a manife&s;tation of their LOVE; becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured by the Scriptures, that "GOD <HI>dwelleth</HI>" in tho&s;e men, who maintain the proper mea&s;ure of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Benevolence</HI> for the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>"BELOVED" (&s;aid the <HI>beloved</HI> Apo&s;tle) <Q><HI>let us</HI> LOVE <HI>one another: for</HI> LOVE <HI>is of</HI> GOD, <HI>and every one that</HI> LOVETH <HI>is born of</HI> GOD, <HI>and knoweth</HI> GOD. <HI>He that</HI> LOVETH NOT <HI>knoweth not God,</HI> FOR GOD IS LOVE. <HI>In this was manife&s;ted the</HI> LOVE OF GOD <HI>towards us, becau&s;e that</HI> GOD <HI>&s;ent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is</HI> LOVE, <HI>not that</HI> WE LOVED GOD, <HI>but that he</HI> LOVED US, <HI>and &s;ent his Son to be the propitiation for our &s;ins.</HI> BELOVED, IF GOD SO LOVED US, <HI>we ought al&s;o to</HI> LOVE ONE ANO|THER.</Q> <HI>No man hath &s;een God at any time. If we love one another,</HI> GOD DWELLETH IN US, <HI>and his</HI> LOVE <HI>"is perfected in us."</HI> 1 John iv. 7&mdash;12. And again, in the 16th ver&s;e&mdash;<Q><HI>We have known and believed the</HI> LOVE <HI>that God hath to us.</HI> GOD IS LOVE, <HI>and he that dwelleth in</HI> LOVE, DWELLETH IN GOD, AND GOD IN HIM. <HI>Herein is our</HI> LOVE MADE PERFECT, &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE>,</Q> 1 John iii. 16. yet as this far exceeds the mea&s;ure of <HI>Love</HI> laid
<PB N="13" REF="11">down in the &s;econd great Command|ment, which is given us as the <HI>general</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="12">or <HI>ordinary</HI> Rule of Life, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch a very difficult duty,
<PB N="15" REF="13">as that of <HI>laying down our Lives for the Brethren,</HI> can only be required of us on
<PB N="16" REF="14">very extraordinary occa&s;ions, as in times of per&s;ecution, or on other &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing emergencies, when &s;ome very &s;ingular Good or Benefit to our <HI>Friends,</HI> our <HI>Country,</HI> or <HI>Mankind in general,</HI> appa|rently depends upon our per&s;everance <HI>unto death</HI> for their &s;akes, in a ju&s;t cau&s;e <HI>to the Glory of God;</HI> or to the manife&s;ta|tion of his revealed <HI>Truth,</HI> for their confirmation and example! This is, in|deed, the be&s;t and mo&s;t noble founda|tion, not only for true PATRIOTISM in all Men, <HI>as Members,</HI> re&s;pectively, <HI>of &s;ome particular Nation,</HI> but al&s;o for UNI|VERSAL BENEVOLENCE, <HI>as Citizens of the World;</HI> which latter Duty &s;hould always regulate and limit the former (viz. PATRIOTISM) by the eternal Rules of
<PB N="17" REF="15">natural Equity and Ju&s;tice. But though a chearful obedience in this ultimate Duty of <HI>laying down our Lives,</HI> and &s;a|crificing <HI>Self-love,</HI> and every temporal Ble&s;&s;ing <HI>for the Good of others,</HI> does un|doubtedly exalt HUMAN NATURE to the highe&s;t pitch of <HI>Heroi&s;m</HI> and <HI>real Dignity,</HI> let us all, neverthele&s;s, pray God (as in effect we do by that compre|hen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion in our daily prayers&mdash; <HI>"Lead us not into temptation"</HI>) to pre|&s;erve us from any &s;uch &s;evere trials of our Obedience and LOVE to him as the nece&s;&s;ity of of <Q><HI>laying down our Lives for the Brethren;</HI></Q> le&s;t, through the want of pre&s;ence of mind, or unwari|ne&s;s, or through weakne&s;s and natural infirmity, any of us &s;hould unhappily &s;hrink back from that ultimate Duty, and thereby incur the dreadful con|demnation of tho&s;e that <HI>deny Chri&s;t be|fore Men!</HI> Let us al&s;o be truly thank|ful, that the <HI>ab&s;olute Command,</HI> in the
<PB N="18" REF="16">&s;econd great Branch of our Duty, by which <HI>all Mankind are to be</HI> JUDGED (as &s;hall hereafter be &s;hewn) extends no farther than to limit SELF-LOVE by a &s;ympathetick Con&s;ideration or <HI>Fellow-feeling</HI> for our <HI>Neighbour</HI>'s welfare, le&s;t the former <HI>(Self-love)</HI> &s;hould be con|&s;idered as the proper and <Q><HI>univer&s;al Principle of Action,</HI></Q> and thereby en|danger the peace and happine&s;s of So|ciety by its <HI>partial</HI> in&s;tigations: let me add too, that if SELF-LOVE is not thus re&s;trained, it will defeat its own Purpo&s;e and fixed Principles of <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation,</HI> by incurring a dreadful and eternal Doom!</P>
<P>The OMISSION of an Act of <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Benevolence</HI> towards our Neighbour, when it is in our power, and occa&s;ion requires it, <HI>is declared by our Lord, the Saviour of the World,</HI> to be as gro&s;s an affront, <HI>even to him&s;elf,</HI> as if <HI>he</HI> had been
<PB N="19" REF="17"><HI>per&s;onally</HI> neglected and denied by us! <Q><HI>Ina&s;much</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e,</HI> YE DID IT NOT TO ME.</Q> Matt. xxv. 45. And if SINS of OMISSION, even towards <HI>the meane&s;t of our Brethren,</HI> are by OUR LORD e&s;teemed as a <HI>per&s;onal Affront to him&s;elf,</HI> we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the actual COMMISSION of Injuries will be infinitely more heinous in his &s;ight, and cannot e&s;cape his ju&s;t Vengeance. We mu&s;t remember al&s;o, that <HI>this Declara|tion</HI> of our Lord will be made to tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches, who &s;hall &s;tand <Q><HI>on the Left Hand,</HI></Q> after the tremendous final &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed upon them! <Q><HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed, into ever|la&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels!</HI></Q> See ver&s;e 41.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t therefore, that <HI>a Viola|lation of</HI> THE LOVE THAT IS DUE TO OUR NEIGHBOUR, is a Violation al&s;o of
<PB N="20" REF="18">THE LOVE OF GOD; and, on the con|trary, <HI>the latter is perfected</HI> by a &s;trict obedience <HI>to the former&mdash;"If we</HI> LOVE <HI>one another</HI>" (&s;ays <HI>the beloved</HI> Apo&s;tle) <Q><HI>God dwelleth in us, and</HI> HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US.</Q> (1 John iv. 12.) So that the two great Commandments appear to be reciprocally included and blended together in their con&s;equences; by which we may more readily perceive the propriety of our Lord's declaration, that the <HI>&s;econd great Commandment is like unto the fir&s;t</HI>
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3) <Q><HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</HI> AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</HI></Q> (Matt. xxii. 37. to 40.)</NOTE>; and this reciprocal connexion between them enables us al&s;o to comprehend the rea&s;on why <HI>the &s;econd</HI> is given <HI>alone</HI> (when BOTH are undoubt|edly nece&s;&s;ary) as the grand te&s;t of Chri|&s;tian obedience, and as the &s;um and e&s;|&s;ence
<PB N="21" REF="19">of the whole Law of God. <Q><HI>For all the Law is fulfilled</HI></Q> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul) <Q><HI>in one word,</HI> (even) <HI>in this, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI></Q> (Gal. v. 14.)</P>
<P>Now a continued multiplication of Statutes (as in England, where the num|ber exceeds the capacity of the human Memory) affords matter only for <HI>Equi|vocation, Doubt,</HI> and <HI>Eva&s;ion,</HI> whereby SOUND LAW is vitiated and corrupted; and the loath&s;ome <HI>Pro&s;titute,</HI> &s;till retain|ing <HI>the Name of</HI> LAW, <HI>ari&s;es</HI> (like the Harlot POPERY from pure CHRISTI|ANITY) <HI>in another Dre&s;s!</HI> She is clothed with the many-coloured garment of mi&s;|con&s;truction, and &s;eats her&s;elf at the right hand of the unju&s;t judge, prompt|ing him with wily Subterfuges, and <HI>bad Precedents</HI> in&s;tead of LAW; whereby he is enabled to en&s;nare the innocent, and &s;creen the guilty.

<PB N="44" REF="42">each other; and therefore, la&s;tly, we mu&s;t acknowledge this &s;ame Precept to be al&s;o THE TRUE MEASURE or Te&s;t on which our eternal Doom will depend in that awful Day, when it <Q><HI>&s;hall be</HI> MEASURED <HI>unto us again,</HI></Q> <HI>according to</HI> THE MEASURE of our Actions, as declared by the <HI>eternal Judge him&s;elf,</HI> (Mat. vii. 2. Mark iv. 24. Luke vi. 38.) who&s;e Words cannot fail! And if even a mere <HI>Neglect</HI> or <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> in our Duty towards our <HI>Neighbour</HI> is &s;o <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> to our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, that he e&s;teems it as a Denial and Affront to his <HI>own Per&s;on,</HI> (which I have already ob&s;erved) how <HI>much more offen&s;ive</HI> to him mu&s;t be <HI>the actual Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Injuries, &s;uch as the Exaction of <HI>an involuntary Service</HI> from our poor Brethren <Q>WITH|OUT WAGES,</Q> and the various Cru|elties u&s;ually practi&s;ed to enforce the &s;ame, which are the nece&s;&s;ary and un|avoidable Attendants on <HI>Slavery</HI>&mdash;What
<PB N="45" REF="43">a dreadful MEASURE of RETRIBUTION, then, may ob&s;tinate and unrepenting <HI>Slaveholders</HI> and <HI>Slavedealers</HI> ju&s;tly expect from the righteous Judge! Surely there is but too much Cau&s;e to apprehend, that Chri&s;t will one Day PROFESS UNTO THEM&mdash;<Q><HI>Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye have</HI> DONE IT UNTO ME!</Q> (Mat. xxv. 40.)</P>
<P>This Sentence, indeed, is applied in the Text to tho&s;e who &s;hall have DONE GOOD to their Brethren; yet by nece&s;|&s;ary Con&s;equence it is equally applicable (as in the 45th ver&s;e) to tho&s;e who have neglected, or &s;hewn them <HI>no Brotherly</HI> LOVE and CHARITY!&mdash;"<HI>Ina&s;much</HI> (&s;aid our Lord) <Q><HI>as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it not to me. And the&s;e</HI></Q> (by which our Lord plainly referred to all that &s;hould neglect or violate that indi&s;pen&s;ible <HI>Brotherly Love</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="44">and <HI>Charity</HI> which he enjoined) <Q><HI>&s;hall go away</HI> INTO EVERLASTING PU|NISHMENT: <HI>but the Righteous into Life eternal!</HI></Q></P>
<P>But alas!&mdash;to <HI>worldly</HI> minded Men the Judgments of <HI>another World</HI> &s;eem too far di&s;tant to awaken their Atten|tion, though they are liable to be called away, in the very next Hour, to a State of Exi&s;tence, wherein the mo&s;t pun|gent Remor&s;e will avail them nothing! From &s;uch therefore, and from tho&s;e unrepenting Individuals, that will &s;till per&s;i&s;t in violating the LAW OF LIBERTY by <HI>Slave-dealing</HI> and <HI>Slave-holding,</HI> it is time to turn away! I have already be|&s;towed too much labour upon them, I mean, with re&s;pect to them&s;elves! But this Warning was not intended for them alone;&mdash;the whole Community&mdash;every Individual (without excepting even tho&s;e who never had the lea&s;t Concern in pro|moting
<PB N="47" REF="45"><HI>Slavery</HI>) is per&s;onally intere&s;ted in the Con&s;ideration of this Subject! For if a Breach of God's Command, even in the <HI>hidden</HI> Crime of a &s;ingle In|dividual, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Achan,</HI> could involve a whole Nation in Trouble
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">(4)"&mdash;<HI>For Achan the Son of Carmi,"&mdash;took of</HI> THE "ACCURSED THING," (i. e. of that which was <HI>devoted to De&s;truction</HI> by God's expre&s;s Command): <Q><HI>And the Anger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t the Children of I&s;rael.</HI></Q> Jo&s;hua vii. 1.&mdash;Thus the whole NATION was involved in the Con&s;equences of Achan's Guilt! Nay, <HI>Jehovah</HI> him&s;elf expre&s;sly imputed the Action of that one Individual to the NATION at large, until a &s;olemn and public Exertion of NATIONAL Ju&s;tice had expiated that pre&s;umptive Breach of his Command! For when Jo&s;hua and the Elders of I&s;rael lay pro&s;trate before God, lament|ing the public Calamity and Di&s;grace, which a late De|feat of their Army had brought upon the NATION,&mdash;<Q><HI>the Lord</HI> (Jehovah) <HI>&s;aid unto Jo&s;hua, Get thee up; wherefore lie&s;t thou thus upon thy Face?</HI> ISRAEL <HI>hath &s;inned, and</HI> THEY HAVE <HI>al&s;o</HI> TRANSGRESSED <HI>my Cove|nant which I commanded them: for</HI> THEY <HI>have even taken of</HI> THE ACCURSED THING, <HI>and have &s;tolen,</HI> (that is, THEY <HI>have &s;tolen</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">)</Q> <Q><HI>and</HI> THEY <HI>have di&s;&s;embled al&s;o, and</HI> THEY <HI>have put</HI> (it) <HI>even among their own Stuff.</HI></Q> (Yet this general Crime, for &s;o it was imputed, was perpetrated by <HI>a &s;ingle Individual,</HI> though the <HI>whole</HI> NATION was doomed to &s;uffer for it, till the actual Ag|gre&s;&s;or &s;hould be brought to <HI>public Ju&s;tice;</HI> and this &s;hould teach us, that the Welfare of NATIONS greatly depends on a &s;trict Admini&s;tration of public <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> le&s;t the State &s;hould be accountable for the Crimes of Individuals.) <HI>"Therefore the Children of I&s;rael"</HI> (&s;aid Jehovah him&s;elf) <Q><HI>could not &s;tand before their Enemies,</HI> (but) <HI>turned</HI> (their) <HI>Backs before their Enemies, becau&s;e they were</HI> ACCURSED.</Q> (Thus the CURSE was tran&s;|ferred to the People from THE ACCURSED THING, until <HI>public Ju&s;tice</HI> could trace and transfer it to the devoted Head of the guilty Per&s;on!) "<HI>Neither will I</HI> (&s;aid Je|hovah) <Q><HI>be with you any more, except ye de&s;troy</HI> THE ACCURSED <HI>from among you.</HI></Q> See the whole Chapter.</NOTE>, and deprive them of God's Ble&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="48" REF="46">how much more hateful in the Sight of God mu&s;t be a <HI>public</HI> Infringement of his ROYAL LAW, THE PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY, by <HI>national</HI> Autho|rity!</P>
<P>The AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, which includes the mo&s;t contemptuous Viola|tions of <HI>Brotherly Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> that men can be guilty of, is openly encouraged and promoted by the Briti&s;h Parliament! And the mo&s;t dete&s;table and oppre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="49" REF="47"><HI>Slavery,</HI> that ever di&s;graced even the unenlightened Heathens, is notoriou&s;ly <HI>tolerated</HI> in the Briti&s;h Colonies by the <HI>public Acts</HI> of their re&s;pective A&s;&s;emblies, &mdash;by Acts that have been ratified with the A&s;&s;ent and Concurrence of BRITISH KINGS!</P>
<P>The horrible Guilt therefore, which is incurred by <HI>Slave-dealing</HI> and <HI>Slave-holding,</HI> is no longer confined to the few hardened <HI>Individuals,</HI> that are im|mediately concerned in tho&s;e baneful Practices, but alas! the WHOLE BRI|TISH EMPIRE is involved!</P>
<P>By the unhappy Concurrence of <HI>Na|tional Authority,</HI> the GUILT is rendered <HI>National;</HI> and <HI>National</HI> GUILT mu&s;t in|evitably draw down from GOD &s;ome tre|mendous <HI>National</HI> Puni&s;hment (which, I tru&s;t, is fully demon&s;trated in my Tract on THE LAW of RETRIBUTION) if we do not &s;peedily <Q><HI>take away the accur&s;ed
<PB N="50" REF="48">Thing from among us,</HI></Q>&mdash;if we do not carefully reform and redre&s;s at lea&s;t every <HI>public</HI> and notorious Violation of GOD's <HI>"Royal Law,"</HI> <Q><HI>the perfect Law of Liberty!</HI></Q></P>
