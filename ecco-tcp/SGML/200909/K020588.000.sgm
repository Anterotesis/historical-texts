<HEAD>INTRODUCTION: ADDRESSED TO THE <HI>ASSOCIATIONS</HI> AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND LEVELLERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. REEVES, the In&s;titutor of the A&s;&s;ociations, has been charged, as appears by the printed Debates in the New&s;papers, by &s;ome Speakers in the two Hou&s;es, with having written a &s;uppo&s;ed libel on the Con&s;titution: a &s;imilar crimination has al&s;o been brought forward again&s;t Mr. Arthur Young, who fir&s;t &s;tated and impre&s;&s;ed upon the Nation the nece&s;&s;ity of property being armed to defend it&s;elf, and thus laid the foundation of the in&s;titution of the Yeomanry Cavalry, to be employed again&s;t external violence, and internal in&s;urrection. The &s;ame Gentle|man has taken the leading part in both the&s;e accu&s;a|tions.</P>
<P>EACH of the above In&s;titutions is hereby expo&s;ed to one common danger. The great majority of mankind judge
<PB N="ii" REF="4">of mea&s;ures by their authors. If their general principles be believed to be inimical to the freedom of our mixed Government, the &s;ame bad quality will be &s;uppo&s;ed to lurk in every one of their mea&s;ures; e&s;pecially &s;uch as &s;hall not have been frequently &s;een carried into exe|cution; and as this cla&s;s of people judges by names, not things, it is evident to what hazards the &s;ucce&s;s of any mea&s;ure requiring the co-operation of multitudes may be expo&s;ed. if an erroneous charge be &s;uffered to be at|tached to the name of its author.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the charge again&s;t the&s;e Gen|tlemen is <HI>admirably calculated</HI> to excite a jealou&s;y again&s;t the plans they have propo&s;ed for the of the public. I now advert particularly to its probable effect on the A&s;&s;ociations founded by Mr. Reeves; for it is to the at|tack upon him that the whole of the following Tract will apply. It was expedient, however, to mention that on Mr. Young, as it is a part of the &s;ame mea&s;ure, and which, for that rea&s;on, will be introduced a &s;econd time to your con&s;ideration, at its proper place.</P>
<P>THESE jealou&s;ies are ea&s;ily improved into clamours; and the&s;e again heightened into the alarming appearance of popular di&s;content. This will weaken your A&s;&s;ocia|tions; it will draw off a great number of the A&s;&s;ociators of the middle cla&s;&s;es, but terrify many more&mdash;the mu&s;cles that make the nerves of the arm effective. For if Di&s;con|tent be unable &s;o totally to paralize your In&s;titution, Fear is at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t it. We have among us tho&s;e who are not ignorant of the receipt to inflame di&s;content to its highe&s;t pitch. They want not the hardine&s;s, in the face of day, to conduct it on preci&s;ely to that very
<PB N="iii" REF="5">point, which immediately precedes the extreme of vio|lence and outrage. If new Meetings of the A&s;&s;ociations become nece&s;&s;ary, numbers will be thus kept away. Tho&s;e who &s;hall venture to come to the &s;upport of the effective Con&s;titution, will be terrified to &s;ee three quarters of their force annihilated: they will hear the commands of their in&s;olent and new ma&s;ters, and be glad to compound for &s;afety by non-efficiency.</P>
<P>LOOK back to the &s;tate of the kingdom, when your A&s;&s;ociations fir&s;t were formed. What man, qualified to think on the intere&s;t of the State, except tho&s;e intere&s;ted in the &s;ubver&s;ion of it, who did not in his face carry all the marks of con&s;ternation? But when men who wi&s;hed well to their country, of all de&s;criptions of parties, be|came united; in their union, in the <HI>bonorum omnium con|&s;en&s;us,</HI> they &s;aw their &s;uperiority: the faction &s;eemed to fall before you.</P>
<P>IT is much to be wi&s;hed on your parts, that the &s;ame popular favour, the &s;ame opinion of the Con&s;titutional principles on which your A&s;&s;ociations were formed, and of the objects they have pur&s;ued, might &s;till &s;econd you, if they &s;hould be again called forth, as the events of every day may add new importance to them. Their continuation and their undimini&s;hed vigour may be nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of legal Government. But if the principles of the man who formed the bond of union by which you are cemented, be injuriou&s;ly reputed to be adver&s;e to the principles of the exi&s;ting limited Monarchy, that union will become the object of popular jealou&s;y, as I have &s;hown before; it will be weakened, and in danger of being rendered nugatory.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">If, therefore, good rea&s;on &s;upport him, you will equitably hear that rea&s;on. Truth knows no predilection. When you fit in judgment, you mu&s;t di&s;card all precon|ceived &s;entiments of favour. I &s;hould not indeed pre&s;s you to forget it any longer than until your ultimate &s;en|tence be given. Were I to fit in judgment on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion, I &s;hould bend all my faculties to fulfil the &s;evere and nece&s;&s;ary functions of a Judge, the rational organ of the Law, that knows no affections. But if the innocence of the defendant &s;hould extort an acquittal from me, I &s;hould then think my awful function at an end; I &s;hould ri&s;e from my tribunal to congratulate the brother, or the benefactor, who had &s;tood as a culprit before me. When I had fini&s;hed my duty as a Judge, tho&s;e of my prior relation would claim the next place. I &s;hall only &s;ay fur|ther, that in the defence of the pa&s;&s;age quoted by Mr. She|ridan from the pamphlet, I impo&s;e this law upon my&s;elf: The principles it contains &s;hall be proved to be the fir&s;t principles of Engli&s;h Law, and on the be&s;t e&s;teemed au|thorities, on <HI>prim&acirc; facie</HI> evidence. Where I apprehend a doubt may be attached to the utility of &s;uch principles, even though laid down in the law books, they &s;hall be &s;upported by the authority of political writers, proved by ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, and the proce&s;s of a regular induction from hi&s;torical examples. The matter purely hi&s;torical &s;hall al&s;o be proved from the be&s;t Engli&s;h hi&s;tories, or hi&s;torical di&s;qui&s;itions on the &s;ubject, and on <HI>prim&acirc; facie</HI> evidence likewi&s;e, as in proofs of the fir&s;t de&s;cription. If the&s;e arguments &s;hall impre&s;s you with conviction, what your well-weighed judgment &s;hall approve you will &s;upport. In the hour of exertion or difficulty, much of your effective &s;trength will depend upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="7">BUT, to prevent mi&s;con&s;truction, &s;omething mu&s;t be added by way of explanation here, before I proceed to another very important con&s;ideration, which mu&s;t find a place in my Addre&s;s to you. It is not meant that the principle of civil A&s;&s;ociations, and tho&s;e to be con&s;idered in the extract from the Pamphlet, are &s;o connected as ne|ce&s;&s;arily to &s;tand and fall together. The effect of the latter on the former is purely accidental, as being &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought forward by the &s;ame man; yet in the pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances of the times, it mu&s;t be neverthe|le&s;s real, although the principles of the A&s;&s;ociations are defen&s;ible on their own proper grounds: and as an attack is recommenced again&s;t them, I &s;tate one of tho&s;e grounds, among others, which at the moment &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf to me. When a body of in&s;urgents are actually a&s;&s;embled, and have ju&s;t begun by open force to attack Government, they are to be repul&s;ed by a&s;&s;em|blies of loyal &s;ubjects, and by the like force. If tho&s;e of the former de&s;cription unite into bodies, actually or appa|rently for the ends &s;tated above, tho&s;e of the latter &s;hould, by a parity of rea&s;on, unite or a&s;&s;ociate to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t them; and by every other means prevent their gathering in &s;uch force, or putting them&s;elves in &s;uch &s;ituations, as might facilitate the attack. No good Government can reject what is a funda|mental principle of perfect Government, as this may be &s;hown to be; for &s;uppo&s;ing a form of Govern|ment of plenary and ab&s;olute perfection &s;hould begin to exi&s;t, it mu&s;t include this principle, or it would want one good property which it po&s;&s;ibly might po&s;&s;e&s;s, the greate&s;t chance of permanency; which is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ed nature of &s;uch a form. It may be &s;aid, that a Government &s;o con&s;tituted would re&s;emble a perfect
<PB N="vi" REF="8">machine, and be able to pre&s;erve it&s;elf in motion without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any additional help: but a Government of that de&s;cription mu&s;t be numbered among the bad forms; for it deba&s;es the human character, by bani&s;hing from every brea&s;t all care about that greate&s;t intere&s;t, <HI>a Public.</HI> Every intere&s;t that could be advanced or ob|&s;tructed would be private. Hence every end pur&s;ued would be little; for the range of the mind of a Nation is near|ly circum&s;cribed by the limits of the object it has to pur&s;ue; and its energies, employed only on little things, never obtain their natural growth. The empire of China is an imperfect example of &s;uch a State. This argument, or others far better, might be urged in vain in favour of the principles of the A&s;&s;ociation, if it could be alledged again&s;t them that they &s;pring from a polluted &s;ource.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;hown how far the utility of the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations is endangered by the accu&s;ations which have been thus urged again&s;t them. I &s;hall now con&s;ider the ends to which the&s;e accu&s;ations are intended apparently to be &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>AT the in&s;tant they were brought forward, the ferment in the &s;pirits of the people was at a height which has been yet unequalled. The populace had been wrought up to attack the King's per&s;on; laws were introduced into the Hou&s;e to cut up the very root of tho&s;e machi|nations by which this atrocious &s;pirit had been kindled, the execution of which laws may ultimately rely much on the &s;upport of the A&s;&s;ociations. The zeal, the alacrity, and the &s;trength of the Cavalry may likewi&s;e tend much to keep back the fir&s;t appearance of violence: and this In&s;titution might be extended into more counties,
<PB N="vii" REF="9">as the approaching nece&s;&s;ity increa&s;ed. The accu&s;ation of Mr. Reeves and Mr. Young have a direct tendency to prevent &s;uch increa&s;e; to weaken the attachment of the one to the cau&s;e in which they are engaged; to parali&s;e the exertions of the other; and to leave the country open to the trea&s;ons which are meditating.</P>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;age which is the object of the legal inquiry to be made, in conjunction with what precedes and follows it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>This is requi&s;ite in every fair &s;tatement of a Writer's meaning or principles: without it, he may be repre&s;ented as &s;peaking what is different or contradictory to them.</P></NOTE>, the original complaint &s;eems to have been intended as a fal&s;e attack only. Nothing was probably expected from it where it was brought forward. But, though the Party imagined it would be inefficacious there, they had con&s;iderable expectation of the effect the bare name of &s;uch a thing might have in another quarter. By a Motion again&s;t the principles &s;aid to have been ad|vanced by Mr. Reeves, and one or two intemperate de|clamations made in &s;upport of it, they had hoped to ren|der the A&s;&s;ociations intirely inefficient, at a time when certain &s;peeches upon another topic tended to create &s;o urgent a nece&s;&s;ity for their mo&s;t &s;pirited exertions in fa|vour of legal Government.</P>
<P>CONTRARY to expectation, the friends of Govern|ment gave way; and &s;ome admitted the book at|tributed to Mr. Reeves to be a libel on the Con&s;titution. If we &s;earch for the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular event, it will not be very difficult to di&s;cover it. It is but at this in&s;tant, as it were, that men begin to examine the Con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="viii" REF="10">and its principles, in the only true &s;ource of in|formation, the letter of the Law. We have all been edu|cated to look for it in brilliant romances of Legi&s;lation, entirely different therefrom. When practical nece&s;&s;ity calls upon us to con&s;ider this political Carte&s;iani&s;m, one error of it drops to-day, another to-morrow; but the multitude that remain &s;till &s;eem almo&s;t as well rooted as ever, when they are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed only as points of &s;pecula|tion. The Writer of the Tract pre&s;ented three or four points relating to the legal Con&s;titution, as the exi&s;ting laws &s;tate them, and that without demon&s;tration. The&s;e, being &s;omewhat different from what is to be found in the fine writings I have ju&s;t mentioned, which are judged by many as infallible &s;tandards of truth, were ha&s;tily con|demned. It might become the dignity of the Commons in future to make it a rule of the Hou&s;e, that in ca&s;e of any writing being there complained of, a Committee &s;hould be appointed to &s;elect &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages from it as they thought required examination; and the&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent to the printer, or author if avowed, and the book &s;hould lie ten days upon the table, before any further proceedings &s;hould be had upon it.</P>
<P>WHEN it was now perceived that &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion was made, a per&s;on of more e&s;tabli&s;hed weight in the Party &s;tepped forward, and converted this fal&s;e attack into a real one, the extent and object of which I &s;hall de&s;cribe. Mr. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eves had, in 1792, &s;ucceeded in in&s;tituting two thou|&s;and A&s;&s;ociations again&s;t Republicans and Levellers. Again&s;t the&s;e likewi&s;e, and our foreign enemies, Mr. Young bad &s;ucceeded in cau&s;ing a fine body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e to be rai&s;ed, and &s;tationed over the country, and the&s;e were for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">)</HI> of what Cromwell
<PB N="ix" REF="11">thought the be&s;t materials. This was to effect great things; and it is as much the intere&s;t of a combination to ruin the men who have done &s;uch things, as men who bear great titles; and our factions at pre&s;ent know their own intere&s;t: I find too in this tran&s;action an exact re&s;em|blance of the conduct of the leaders of the Long Parlia|ment; not indeed in that part of their conduct which de|&s;erves our prai&s;es, but in their extreme violence.&mdash;Tho&s;e who they &s;uppo&s;ed could effect much for the King, were impeached, (&s;ome of them had titles indeed,) and their judges were forced by mobs to condemn them.</P>
<P>THIS new a&s;&s;ailant is reported in the public prints to have &s;tated this Pamphlet to be a part of a &s;eries of at|tempts to make the Crown everything and the People nothing. He joins in this cen&s;ure the writings of <HI>Soame Jenyns, Dr. Whitaker,</HI> and <HI>Mr. Young;</HI> and by a &s;weep|ing clau&s;e, he includes an indefinite number of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who, in concert with Mr. Reeves's Com|mittee, have endeavoured to pre&s;erve the peace and legal Con&s;titution of the kingdom. From the encouragement which the &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance to laws, now e&s;tabli&s;hed, has lately received from the violent declarations of the Mino|rity, the union of the be&s;t abilities of &s;uch men is likely to become more nece&s;&s;ary than ever; and at this very junc|ture, to deter them from employing their be&s;t faculties in the cau&s;e of their country, the terror of a Parliamen|tary pro&s;ecution is hung over their heads. Nor are the A&s;&s;ociations le&s;s directly denounced, "who&s;e &s;y&s;tem," the &s;ame Gentleman is declared in the&s;e Papers to have a&s;&s;erted to be, <Q>to draw the Lords and Commons into contempt, and to place the King to govern
<PB N="x" REF="12">alone:</Q> adding al&s;o, that if the powers of the Committee <Q>had been enlarged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>What precedent was &s;elected to favour &s;uch enlargement? That of a Committee of the Commons in 1680. And what was one of the offences of <HI>Janes</HI> and <HI>We&s;ton?</HI> They had &s;aid that <HI>Calvin</HI> was a favourer of Democracy. I cite the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory'.&mdash;Did he not ultimately maintain the liberty of the Republic of Geneva<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 32. p. 299.</NOTE> as &s;uch, when it was in danger of falling as &s;oon as it ro&s;e?&mdash;This particular inquiry was in&s;tituted to keep up the ferment of the Nation about the Popi&s;h Plot;&mdash;a di&s;grace to our hi&s;tory;&mdash;and by a Hou&s;e of Commons. "who greatly lamented the death of <HI>Bedloe</HI> "as a material witne&s;s, on who&s;e te&s;timony they much depended;" who endeavoured by their countenance and protection to purge off the extreme infamy of <HI>Dangerfield</HI> (pilloried four times, and an outlaw<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 121.</NOTE>), and to re&s;tore him to a capacity of being a witne&s;s<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 129.</NOTE>; embracing the mo&s;t incredible texture of fal&s;ehood and wickedne&s;s, and &s;upporting the belief of it by a &s;eries of legal murders, to in|troduce the Exclu&s;ion Bill, whatever the con&s;equences of that mea|&s;ure might have been. The popular violences and anarchy of the in&s;urrection at Mun&s;ter, had at fir&s;t flung a load of odium on the Prote&s;tants in general, and Luther had found it nece&s;&s;ary to refute the charges brought again&s;t him&s;elf and his di&s;ciples. But it is needle&s;s to make any ob&s;ervations on the wor&s;e part of the con|duct of the Parliament of 1640, pieced with &s;ome links of the chain of mea&s;ures taken up by that of 1680.</P>
<P>If the matter which is here &s;tated from the public papers was really brought forward in the Hou&s;e. I feel &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment at the impolicy of its introduction. Men had pre&s;ently after &s;ome late State Trials, reflected pretty much upon tho&s;e which took place before London Juries at the time of the Popi&s;h Plot; the period of our hi&s;tory the New&s;papers &s;tate to have been referred to. Can it
<PB N="xi" REF="13">be doubted but Faction led on &s;ome, and fear for their own &s;afety, amid&s;t enemies they could not at all times guard again&s;t, induced others, to find tho&s;e guilty who&s;e innocence was &s;ufficiently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by evidence? And is it not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a guilty per&s;on, with proofs as &s;trong again&s;t him, would even with more facility have been declared innocent, if the Juries had been influenced that way by the &s;ame motives? And we find charges of this kind, when the offenders were of the popular party, &s;trongly urged again&s;t the Juries of the metropolis in the la&s;t century. (See Hume, v. 8. p. 171. 173. Dalrymple's Mem. 410. 1771. p. 4. 15.) The mention of the Committee of 1680, points out, as with a &s;e&s;cue, the trials &s;o connected with it.</P>
<PB N="x" REF="12"></NOTE>, in pur&s;uance of the precedent on a like occa&s;ion in 1680, it could have
<PB N="xi" REF="13">proved that the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations were part of the &s;y&s;|tem of a deep-laid con&s;piracy to e&s;tabli&s;h military de&s;poti&s;m.</Q> This charge, it is to be ob&s;erved, includes all the A&s;&s;ociations, which are &s;tated to amount to two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THESE accu&s;ations bear a very clo&s;e re&s;emblance (accidental or de&s;igned) to the conduct of the Long Par|liament, <Q>who were re&s;olved to render the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able bodies of the Nation obnoxious to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, 8vo. 1767. v. 6. p. 309.</NOTE>.</Q> The exerci&s;e of powers <Q>warranted by all former precedents, yet not authorized by &s;tatute, they declared to be ille|gal, and the per&s;ons who had a&s;&s;umed them delin|quents<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">10.</NOTE>.</Q> The crime indeed of delinquency they did not exactly define; it is to be under&s;tood, however, as &s;omething inferior to that of changing our mixed Govern|ment into a &s;imple Monarchy, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a mili|tary de&s;poti&s;m. To the latter part of the charge I have to ob&s;erve, it &s;eems meant to include the &s;ub&s;cribers to
<PB N="xii" REF="14">the Yeomanry Cavalry, who&s;e different meetings were virtually A&s;&s;ociations. But as the&s;e corps were rai&s;ed in pur&s;uance of an Act of Parliament, that has hi|therto protected them from being included by name in the&s;e accu&s;ations, though they appear not ob&s;curely marked out as part at lea&s;t of the Janizaries or Praeto|rians of the new Tyranny. I &s;imply trace out the pa|rallel between the &s;pirit of the mea&s;ure &s;aid to be at|tempted by Oppo&s;ition now, and tho&s;e votes of the Long Parliament; &s;trengthened by which, a few vile incendiaries were able to lead the Nation into a civil war, even after Government had been reformed and puri|fied in all its branches. I hope it is &s;uperfluous to at|tempt to awaken your vigilance by a detail of the years of mi&s;ery and de&s;olation in which it involved this king|dom; but to that vigilance I mu&s;t recommend to reflect duly upon the enormity of the declarations which the Papers have lately put into the mouths of &s;ome great Political Characters. An obedience to temporary re&s;train|ing Laws, the unfortunate fruit of the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and meant to terminate with that nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>is held out</HI> to the populace, not as a moral duty, but an act of prudence only. To me the&s;e violent declarations, if really deli|vered, &s;eem not to be accounted for on any other footing than that of &s;ome confidence the &s;peakers may entertain in the populace, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might be able to give them effect.

<P><PB N="xiii" REF="15">THE Pamphlet attributed to Mr. Reeves is &s;aid to con|tain uncon&s;titutional matter, and this &s;eems to have been admitted by an Authority which you have not frequently found rea&s;on to object to.

<HEAD>A DEFENCE, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering the Pamphlet which is the &s;ubject of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, and which has been attributed to Mr. REEVES, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;tate the &s;entiments of the Writer on &s;everal points relating to our legal Con|&s;titution. In the &s;econd place, the paragraph read from it by Mr. Sturt will be con&s;idered on authorities of law and hi&s;tory. To this will be added, a vindication of the remaining parts of the Letter which have been cen|&s;ured.</P>
<P>IT is evident from what pa&s;&s;ed in the Debates upon this tract, "that a re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e may be re&s;cinded" in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion in which it is made. I bring forward here &s;ome rea&s;ons which may be urged in favour of &s;uch a re&s;ci&s;&s;ion of the Re&s;olutions on this work, a thing which I &s;uppo&s;e to be perfectly in order; for a Re&s;olution being the act of one Hou&s;e of Parliament only, it certainly is as legal for an individual to plead for its being re&s;cinded, as for the repeal of a law, which is the act of the whole Parliament. Be&s;ide, the Hou&s;e of Commons are the guardians and tru&s;tees of every individual; though the fir&s;t term, per|haps,
<PB N="16" REF="18">be&s;t implies their pre-eminence and duty. If a guar|dian direct a &s;uit to be commenced in the name of any per&s;on for whom he is in tru&s;t&punc; &s;uch ward may go to him, and lay down his rea&s;on to induce him to withdraw it; and if there were good ground for the application, the lowe&s;t individual who was guardian to another would have the privilege to comply with it; nor can &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly as the Hou&s;e of Commons want a privilege col|lectively that every one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es individually in &s;imilar ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE matter which may be urged again&s;t this Pamphlet I &s;hall take from the &s;peeches attributed to the Members of both Hou&s;es in the public prints; they are the be&s;t au|thorities people in general have to judge from, and may be received as faithful enough to the principles and leading opinions, though le&s;s accurate as to the words of the &s;peakers. I therefore do not from tho&s;e publications quote the name of any &s;peaker.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>MEN who are friends to our legal Con&s;titution, and to the &s;pirit of it, agree in all the main outlines, and differ more or le&s;s only on &s;ubordinate points; on which, if you find two individuals agreed, you will not find even a &s;ingle &s;ub&s;ection of a party, all the members of which bold preci&s;ely the &s;ame opinion. It is by the&s;e great outlines, therefore, that the con&s;titutional principles of our Author are to be judged.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">IN the public prints, one of the conductors of the attack on this Pamphlet is made to declare, that it is part of a &s;eries of attempts to make the Crown everything, and the People nothing. There cannot be a fuller contradiction to this charge than certain pa&s;&s;ages contained in the work it&s;elf. The powers and dignity ve&s;ted in the King are declared to be &s;ufficient for his high &s;tation in the following words: We have <Q>an hereditary King, who bears all the burthen of Government, who is endued <HI>with</HI> ALL <HI>the power</HI> NECESSARY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, all that is nece&s;&s;ary, and no more.</NOTE> <HI>to carry it on,</HI> and who enjoys ALL <HI>the honour and pre-eminence</HI> NECESSARY TO GIVE SPLENDOR <HI>to &s;o high a &s;tation</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 9. l. 22.</NOTE>.</Q> The word "hereditary" will po&s;&s;ibly give a little more di&s;gu&s;t to &s;ome than will be openly avowed; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to guard a part where you know that your adver&s;ary, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, dares not to aim a blow; therefore we will con&s;ider the only objection he will venture to bring forward. The Writer, he might urge, for anything that here appears to the contrary, may con&s;ider the right of the King as <HI>divine and indefea&s;ible.</HI> But I think, when an author, &s;omewhat ela|borately, endeavours to limit his own terms, exclu&s;ively, to another and more ordinary &s;en&s;e than they obviou&s;ly bear, he is to be &s;uppo&s;ed to wi&s;h to have them under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e only. What that is let him lay down. Now among <Q>the high preten&s;ions, founded on vi&s;ionary and refined theories,</Q> like ca&s;tles in the air, <Q>I thought (&s;ays this Writer), that the divine indefea&s;ible right of Kings, and other fancies of former times, were exploded;</Q> and he adds, "becau&s;e they have no warrant in law<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 47. l. 1.</NOTE>." He a&s;&s;erts, indeed, that a Monarchy is preferable to the ty|ranny of <Q>five hundred Republicans, that govern by
<PB N="18" REF="20">their ordinances, that is, by their own will.</Q> But what &s;pecies of Monarchy is it he here prefers to &s;uch a Re|public? That under which we are <Q>the &s;ubjects of a King who governs by law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 16 l. 6.</NOTE>.</Q> And I ob&s;erve further, that by the term <HI>law</HI> the context requires us to under&s;tand the law of the limited Monarchy of England. Some Members of the Minority, I believe, when they have been obliged to &s;peak explicitly on the con&s;equences of the French oligarchy of de&s;pots, have gone a little further.</P>
<P>So much for the foundation of the fir&s;t part of the charge, that the Author of this Pamphlet wi&s;hes to make the King everything. Now let us &s;ee what ground there is for imputing to him a wi&s;h to make the People nothing. In the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t direct contradiction to this, I &s;hall &s;how that he admits the influence of the People in terms which prove his high &s;en&s;e of its utility, and even of the nece&s;&s;ity of its frequent interpo&s;ition. Their actual influence, and its utility, are inferred from the&s;e words: <Q>The people of &s;en&s;e who look on have a great &s;way, though not always &s;een, in balancing the weight of parties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 59. l. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> in what terms is it that he men|tions their con&s;equence, during every Meeting of Parlia|ment? On the deliberations of that A&s;&s;embly, "Engli&s;h|men, &s;ays he, <Q>this is a &s;ea&s;on when your &s;uperin|tending influence is mo&s;t needed; and we u&s;ually &s;ee it is then mo&s;t happily predominant<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 80. l. 3.</NOTE>.</Q> What is the good &s;en&s;e of the country but the good &s;en&s;e of the People? Does not this Writer tell us, that <Q>nothing can be brought to a &s;ucce&s;sful conclu&s;ion, unle&s;s it is approved by the good &s;en&s;e of the country<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 4. l. 2.</NOTE>?</Q> Does he not call the &s;way it
<PB N="19" REF="21">enjoys "gentle and u&s;eful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 4. l. 9.</NOTE>?" Does he not in&s;i&s;t at large that it has been the pre&s;ervative again&s;t every party which has been engaged in bad councils<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 3. the whole.</NOTE>? With this the pam|phlet begins; and what was the la&s;t thought dwelling upon his mind at the conclu&s;ion? <Q>Engli&s;hmen, the Parliament is now a&s;&s;embled.</Q> *** <HI>You,</HI> therefore&mdash;<HI>you!</HI> at lea&s;t, <HI>"watch"</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">La&s;t words of Pamphlet.</NOTE>! Such are the principles contained in a pamphlet which is part of a &s;eries of mea&s;ures, the &s;econd object of which is to make the People nothing!</P>
<P>I GO on, with &s;omewhat more brevity, to &s;tate other principles of this Writer. On our excellent form of Government he &s;ays, that it is "real and &s;ub&s;tantial;" <Q>we &s;ee and feel it; we can take its height and its depth; and we know its movements, becau&s;e they are regulated by e&s;tabli&s;hed and known laws;</Q>and he adds, <Q>that this is the only Con&s;titution ever &s;uppo&s;ed or named by men of &s;ober minds and &s;ound under&s;tanding<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 57. l. 24.</NOTE>.</Q> Now this de&s;cription certainly includes all that is con&s;tituted; and he who adds any other things to this idea of the Con&s;titu|tion, cannot affirm they are con&s;tituted; and I would wi&s;h him for the future, for the &s;ake of logical di&s;tinctne&s;s, to call all &s;uch things, the <HI>uncon&s;tituted</HI> parts of the Con&s;titu|tion. But we &s;hall have to revert again to the double &s;en&s;e of the term Con&s;titution, whence the wilde&s;t abu&s;es have ari&s;en. But of the Con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed by law he &s;ays, its <Q>be&s;t title is profe&s;&s;ed to be, its conformity to the principles of rea&s;on<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 13. la&s;t line.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>HIS &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of Civil Liberty I &s;hall introduce by ob&s;erving, that our noble&s;t principles never
<PB N="20" REF="22">can be di&s;honoured but by actual fanatici&s;m, or by the viler hypocri&s;y of tho&s;e men who, for ends which will not bear the light, put on the wilde&s;t appearance of that fana|tici&s;m to kindle the reality in others. Impre&s;&s;ed with this truth, the Writer of the Pamphlet reprobates tho&s;e <Q>who have rendered the be&s;t things odious by THEIR corrupt contact; who have made the friendly appellation of <HI>Citizen</HI> a badge of &s;eparation and enmity; and the very name of Liberty &s;u&s;pected to the ear of an Engli&s;h|man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 72. l. 21.</NOTE>.</Q> It would require a logic which I am not ma&s;ter of to find an enemy to that "be&s;t" of "things," <HI>liberty,</HI> in the man who admits it &s;o to be, and who cen|&s;ures with &s;uch vigour tho&s;e who have brought its name into di&s;credit.</P>
<P>THIS act of his political creed would be incomplete without the addition of the Writer's &s;entiments on that great event which placed King William on the Throne of the&s;e kingdoms. This, he &s;ays, <Q>was brought about by the energy, good &s;en&s;e, and firmne&s;s, of &s;ome of the be&s;t and greate&s;t men in the Nation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 43. l. 2.</NOTE>.</Q> Yet he &s;tands charged in a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;peech with <Q>having written a libel on the illu&s;trious characters who brought it about.</Q> I know of no more liberal prai&s;e that imagination could devi&s;e to give to it than to &s;ay, it was in everything ade|quate to the occa&s;ion, and in nothing &s;uperfluous. This he does in the following words, in which he &s;peaks of the Reformation at the &s;ame time: <Q>The&s;e memorable tran&s;|actions were conducted in a way that was truly Engli&s;h; the actors in them proceeded with their re|medy as far as the di&s;ea&s;e reached, and no further<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 25 l. 11.</NOTE>;</Q>
<PB N="21" REF="23">and returning to the &s;ubject, in another place, he fully declares it to be <Q>a precedent to be regarded with reve|rence and with gratitude toward tho&s;e who made it, but which we hope never to have occa&s;ion to follow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 40. l. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> Is this ground for the Hou&s;e to re&s;olve that he has written "a libel on the Revolution;" that <Q>he &s;peaks of it with contempt;</Q> that he repre&s;ents it as "a farce?" for &s;uch are the charges again&s;t him by the paper &s;peech-makers. The la&s;t &s;entence of the above extract, we &s;up|po&s;e, may give rea&s;onable grounds of uno&s;ten&s;ible, though deep, di&s;gu&s;t to &s;ome of his enemies. After this &s;pirited eulogy of the great movers of the great tran&s;action of 1688, and of the tran&s;action it&s;elf, what he &s;ays of the term Revolution is a que&s;tion for a court of grammarians, not of law: but that will find its place to be con&s;idered. He &s;eems indeed to me to think, that our &s;cience of poli|tics may want a new nomenclature as well as that of che|mi&s;try: but in this he mu&s;t expect to be &s;turdily oppo&s;ed, to the la&s;t, by the partizans of Dr. Prie&s;tley and the old phlogi&s;tic theory.</P>
<P>IT appears therefore, to &s;um up the whole, to be this Writer's &s;entiments, that the power of the King, with its legal limitations, is &s;ufficient; that the Good Sen&s;e of the People has, and ought to have, great influence with the Legi&s;lature, which influence it is their duty to exert; that the events of 1688 were a remedy to the pre-exi&s;ting evil, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and fully adequate; to the authors of which we ought to look up with gratitude and reverence. And in the&s;e &s;entiments extracted from the Pamphlet are fully compri&s;ed the great outlines of the real principles of our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">THERE remains very little more to be &s;aid, connected with this branch of my &s;ubject, except, that if any part of the Pamphlet &s;hall, on examination, be found to bear two &s;en&s;es, the fir&s;t of which &s;hall be found to agree with what is above laid down or any other part of the context, while the &s;econd does not &s;o agree, the former &s;en&s;e is to be taken to be the true meaning of the author; that is, every part &s;hall be &s;o con&s;trued (if po&s;&s;ible) that the whole may &s;tand. I now proceed to examine, whether there is anything to be found in the remainder of this Pamphlet incon&s;i&s;tent with the extracts already made from it.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Writer of the Letter, I am con&s;idering, has divided it into &s;ix parts, as appears by the &s;ummary in the title-page. The &s;econd part is on the nature of the Engli&s;h Govern|ment, and it contains the paragraph &s;aid to be a libel on the Con&s;titution. To the con&s;ideration of that paragraph I &s;hall prefix a brief analy&s;is of what precedes it in that &s;ection, together with the mo&s;t material &s;trictures reported in the papers to have been made upon it.</P>
<P>THE King (makes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Words of Legi&s;lation, "the King wills it" (i. e.) by and with &amp;c.</NOTE> or) enacts laws, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Lords and Commons.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">HE executes the&s;e laws according to the verdict of a Grand and Petty Jury.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to one &s;imple view of the Royal Power, that both in the act of Legi&s;lation and the execution of Law it is limited by two prior negatives.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;cription of the Writer &s;eems more accurate, and, according to the lax &s;en&s;e of the term, more con&s;ti|tutional than the parallel pa&s;&s;age in Black&s;tone: <Q>In England, the &s;upreme power is divided into two branches; the one Legi&s;lative, to wit, the Parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of King, Lords, and Commons; the other executive, con&s;i&s;ting of the King alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comm. vol. i. p. 147.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>HERE I have to ob&s;erve, that the new&s;papers repre&s;ent a Member of one Hou&s;e to have declared, that this Author has &s;tated <Q>the Con&s;titution of this country to be an ab|&s;olute Monarchy;</Q> and that he has <Q>&s;aid di&s;tinctly, that the King makes laws and executes laws,</Q> totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the modifications of this power as laid down above. In the &s;ame &s;pirit was an ob&s;ervation there &s;aid to have been made in another Hou&s;e, that the Writer in&s;inu|ates <Q>that all per&s;onal &s;ecurity and property is dependent on the King.</Q> It will be contended, perhaps, that he admits the limitations he has de&s;cribed above to be parts of the Con&s;titution <HI>de facto</HI> only; and it may be made a que&s;tion, with what degree of regard he looks upon tho&s;e two prior negatives of the &s;ubject, on every exertion of the powers of the Sovereign? In an&s;wer to this, I will add a few extracts more from his Letter to tho&s;e already made.
<PB N="24" REF="26">He begins his book with complimenting his countrymen upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more good &s;en&s;e than their neigh|bours; and his leading proof of it is, <Q>that he has yet not &s;een,</Q> el&s;ewhere, <Q>equal marks of it in tho&s;e matters where, of all others, they &s;hould be manife&s;ted; I mean, (&s;ays he) in their <HI>Laws and Government</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 2. l. 3.</NOTE>.</Q> Con&s;idered in a &s;econd point of view, he calls the exi&s;ting Govern|ment <Q>an organ of public union and activity, which is adapted to the <HI>humour</HI> and <HI>mode of thinking</HI> of tho&s;e" *** who live under it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 9. l. 11.</NOTE>;</Q> that humour, the leading quality of which he de&s;cribes to be the jealou&s;y of power, with|out the turbulent ambition of it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 5. l. 14.</NOTE>; that mode of thinking formed by the good &s;en&s;e of a nation whom he holds to po&s;&s;e&s;s more of that quality <Q>than any other in the world<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 2. l. 10.</NOTE>.</Q> And almo&s;t at the conclu&s;ion of his work, impre&s;&s;ed with the general view of the whole &s;tructure of our Government, he affirms, <Q>that it is &s;o compacted in all its parts, that every conceit of politicians mu&s;t vani&s;h before it.</Q></P>
<P>THESE things premi&s;ed, I &s;hall give at length the whole of the paragraph in which the pa&s;&s;age objected to is found; di&s;tingui&s;hing the parts of the latter which form a di&s;tinct Propo&s;ition, or imply one, by breaks.</P>
<P N="1">I. <Q>WITH the exception, therefore, of the advice and con&s;ent of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament; and the inter|po&s;ition of Juries, the Government, and the admini&s;tra|tion of it in all its parts, may be &s;aid to re&s;t wholly and &s;olely on the King, and tho&s;e appointed by him.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P 68 l. 20.</NOTE> Tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="27">two adjuncts of <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Juries</HI> are &s;ub&s;idiary and occa&s;ional; but the King's power is a &s;ub&s;tantive one, always vi&s;ible and active. By his Officers, and in his name, everything is tran&s;acted that relates to the peace of the realm and the protection of the &s;ubject. The &s;ubject eels this, and acknowledges with thankfulne&s;s a &s;uperintending &s;overeignty, which alone is congenial with the &s;entiments and temper of Engli&s;hmen.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>IN FINE, the Government of England is a Monar|chy; the Monarch is the antient &s;tock from which have &s;prung tho&s;e goodly branches of the Legi&s;lature, the Lords and Commons, that at the &s;ame time give orna|ment to the tree, and afford &s;helter to tho&s;e who &s;eek protection under it. But the&s;e are &s;till only branches, and derive their origin and their nutriment from their common parent; they may be lopped off, and the tree is a tree &s;till, &s;horn indeed of its honours, but not like them ca&s;t into the fire.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. <Q><HI>The Kingly Government may go on in all its functions without Lords or Commons: it has heretofore done &s;o for years together, and in our times it does &s;o during every rece&s;s of Par|liament; but without the King,</HI> HIS <HI>Parliament is no more.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="4">IV. <Q>The King, therefore, alone it is who nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub&s;i&s;ts without change or diminution; and from HIM alone we uncea&s;ingly derive the protection of Law and Government.</Q></P>
<P>THE analy&s;is of this paragraph is as follows: It con&s;i&s;ts of four parts, as numbered: In the fir&s;t, an account is given of the nature of the Royal Power; in the &s;econd,
<PB N="26" REF="28">the origin of the Second and Third E&s;tates <HI>as they now exi&s;t,</HI> and &s;ome con&s;equences from their being &s;o derived; in the third, he compares the legal powers of the King and the Two E&s;tates with regard to one quality or accident of their operation, that is, their perpetuity; and in the fourth, he reverts to the &s;ub&s;tantive power of the King affirmed in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE mode in which the citation was made from the whole of the paragraph was this: The whole &s;econd part was taken, and, from the fir&s;t period of the third, the fir&s;t colon or member being cut off, was applied to what pre|cedes, as if explanatory thereof.</P>
<P>THIS mode, therefore, of quoting a pa&s;&s;age for cen&s;ure, is highly cen&s;urable; for on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;o much ought to be quoted as to exhibit the full and perfect meaning of the Writer; and the colon with which the citation ends in|dicates the &s;en&s;e of the la&s;t part to be not completed. A com|mon Engli&s;h Grammar may be cited for this, where we read, that when <Q>a member of a &s;entence, which of it &s;elf would make a complete &s;entence, and &s;o requires a greater pau&s;e than a &s;emicolon, yet is followed by an additional part, making a more full and perfect &s;en&s;e, may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a colon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lowth's Grammar, 1776, p. 154.</NOTE>.</Q> But beyond this colon the accu&s;ers of the Letter-Writer did not read, though three &s;entences follow in the period to limit and explain the meaning of the fir&s;t, which they &s;evered from them in the citation.</P>
<P>THE additional colon has likewi&s;e another mark of &s;everance from what precedes it; it contains ab&s;tract mat|ter: all that precedes it is metaphorical: therefore there

<HEAD>III. FROM POLITICAL PRINCIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t con&s;tituted mixed Monarchies are tho&s;e in which the E&s;tates have &s;prung out of the Monarchy; this &s;hall be proved by authority, by ab&s;tract rea&s;on, and by hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="35">1. <HI>From Authority.</HI></P>
<Q>MONARCHY (&s;ays Lord Bolingbroke, comparing the &s;imple forms of Government) is to be preferred to other Governments, becau&s;e you can better ingraft any de&s;cription of Republic on a Monarchy, than anything of Monarchy upon the Republican forms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Burke's "Reflections," 4th edit. p. 187.</NOTE></Q>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ab&s;tract Rea&s;oning.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand here, that a &s;imple Monarchy is the be&s;t &s;imple Government to have lived under, antecedent to the change to a mixed Monarchy; the conclu&s;ion will not be weakened if it be admitted to be a bad inn in a dirty village, but from which the be&s;t road leads to a fine place you are de&s;irous to go to; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that a mixed Government, generated out of a &s;imple Monarchy, may admit the &s;ame quantity of political liberty, and a greater degree of per&s;onal free|dom, than if generated from a &s;imple Republic; for the antecedent habit of allegiance and &s;ubordination being greater, while it continues &s;upported by the con&s;ideration of the legal origin of the E&s;tates, the coercion of laws may be le&s;s, or per&s;onal freedom greater, and the &s;ame general regularity be produced.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hi&s;torical Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>WE are now to examine this principle by induction, or the experiments thereon recorded in hi&s;tory; an evidence in the&s;e matters &s;uperior to any furni&s;hed by ab&s;tract principles.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">THE fir&s;t example is that of the Roman Republic: In the &s;peech of Galba in Tacitus, it is &s;aid, that the Empire could not be held together without a &s;ingle per&s;on at the head of it. I look upon this profound politician as the author of the &s;peech; and the principle, as deduced by him from a retro&s;pective view of the Roman Hi&s;tory: This &s;ingle per&s;on was in power, though not in title, a Monarch, e&s;tabli&s;hed by an armed force. The new &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed by Augu&s;tus was a <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed</HI> arbitrary power; and the admini&s;tration, at lea&s;t after his time, tyrannical in the extreme.</P>
<P>ENGLAND was in the la&s;t century, after the death of Charles I. reduced to a Republic verging to anarchy. A &s;ingle per&s;on, in power a Monarch, was e&s;tabli&s;hed by an armed force; the new &s;y&s;tem was that of arbitrary power, <HI>le&s;s di&s;gui&s;ed</HI> than that of Rome under Augu&s;tus; the trials of the &s;tate criminals were by high courts of ju&s;|tice, without juries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, vol. 7. p. 245.</NOTE>; the A&s;iatic &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m was introduced, the country being divided into di&s;tricts, under Major Generals, who had power to decimate the incomes, not of the Royali&s;ts only, but al&s;o of other in|dividuals, and who levied the taxes impo&s;ed by the Protec|tor's Council of Fifteen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>: they were laid a&s;ide by him two years before his death. That he continued his arbi|trary taxation to the la&s;t is evident, for the grants of his la&s;t A&s;&s;embly amounted to 1,300,000 l. for a year only, and it does not appear that any taxes were voted to rai&s;e even that &s;um<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 285.</NOTE>; but he levied in taxes, upon an average, two million yearly<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 347.</NOTE>. His admini&s;tration was rigid, at lea&s;t to the mea&s;ure of his &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">THESE are examples of the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on, ingrafted upon a Republic by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an armed force, degenerating into tyranny; we pa&s;s on to tho&s;e which have &s;eemingly had a more promi&s;ing origin.</P>
<P>HOLLAND, though not in name, yet in effect was a limited Monarchy, both under its elective and hereditary Stadtholders; or a limited Monarchy ari&s;ing out of a Republican Con&s;titution: that it was effectively &s;uch a Monarchy we have the authority of King William, who called him&s;elf Stadtholder of England and King of Hol|land.</P>
<P>IN this State there were effected four Revolutions in 178 years, ending in 1747; the office of Stadtholder was twice &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by edict, and twice re&s;tored by popular in&s;urrections, for a purpo&s;e which will pre&s;ently be &s;een: it is here noted that the mean interval between two Revo|lutions was forty-four years and a half.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e, between the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Repub|lic and the year 1787, four other Revolutions were very nearly effected: The fir&s;t by Prince Maurice; the &s;econd by his grand&s;on William; the third, when the City of Am&s;terdam invited Prince Ca&s;imir to &s;et up again&s;t King William, which he declined; and the fourth, when the pre&s;ent Prince of Orange was expelled from the Hague in 1787. Thus in 218 years there were eight Revolutions effected, or nearly effected; and the mean interval between the imminent hazard of one Revolution and another was twenty-&s;even years and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">THE longe&s;t term of fixed government in that country was from the death of King William to the year 1747, or for the term of forty-five years.</P>
<P>IT is to be noted, that the primary cau&s;e of the&s;e Revo|lutions, was the power of a &s;ingle per&s;on being grafted upon a Republic; but there is one principle which a com|mercial Republic will adopt, which will greatly accelerate the fall of the mixed form they may be de&s;irous to intro|duce, or de&s;troy its &s;tability: but as it ari&s;es out of the &s;imple form in &s;uch a State, and as all Republics tend thereto, I &s;hall not lengthen the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations with any further notice of it.</P>
<P>THE fourth example will be the French Con&s;titution of 1791. The fiction was adopted by the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly of grafting a Monarchy upon a Republic; all appearances of the principles of the former were &s;oon an|nihilated, by the change of opinion introduced by this novel principle, and by force jointly. This Con&s;titution <HI>nominally</HI> la&s;ted one year.</P>
<P>I DECLINE adding more in&s;tances, not to lengthen this part of the tract. Of the four examples of mixed Mo|narchies ri&s;ing out of a Republic, two terminated in de&s;|poti&s;m; one was perpetually expo&s;ed to Revolutions; and the fourth ended, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it aro&s;e, in anarchy.</P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, that all debates upon this que&s;tion mu&s;t proceed upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that it is in our choice out of which of the two forms of &s;imple Government we
<PB N="37" REF="39">will originate a mixed Monarchy. If a General had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of two gates of a town which he wanted to occupy, in the &s;treets leading from one of which he had few or no ob&s;tacles to expect; but he knew that in the quarter into which the other opened all of them were enfiladed by cannon, were guarded by barricades, and full of covered pits and wolf-holes, and the hou&s;es on each &s;ide of the way occupied by mu&s;queteers; there is little difficulty to determine which entrance he ought to prefer.</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion certainly cannot pa&s;s off without the Con&s;titution of America being introduced into it: There is certainly &s;omething of limited Monarchy to be found in the office of Pre&s;ident, but no conclu&s;ion can yet be drawn from it; it has not been e&s;tabli&s;hed long enough for its latent vices, if any &s;uch exi&s;t, to break out. Experience &s;hews us there was no principle of &s;tability in the Con|&s;titution of Holland, yet the mean interval between one actual Revolution and another was forty-four years and a half; and between a Revolution effected, or nearly effect|ed, twenty-&s;even years and a quarter. That of America has not yet &s;tood the &s;horter of tho&s;e periods; experience has not therefore proved this Con&s;titution to be as &s;table as even that of Holland was; be&s;ides &s;omething like &s;moke has been before, and is now di&s;cernibly breaking out of &s;ome crevices of the building.</P>
<P><Q>DIVISION (&s;ays an eminent American writer) is a calamity which we have more occa&s;ion to &s;ear; and I &s;ee with infinite regret that ob&s;tinate factions are be|ginning to be formed; to what degree they may pro|ceed in decompo&s;ing and di&s;&s;olving the pre&s;ent harmo|nious

<HEAD>PROPOSITION III. EVEN the legal capacity of acting may be taken from the Hou&s;es by violence, the effect of which mu&s;t &s;ub|&s;i&s;t &s;ome time after the violence is removed; but at
<PB N="44" REF="46">all times the legal capacity of action remains in the Crown.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, To avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of repetition, I note here, once for all, that throughout this article it is to be taken for granted, that no act of abdication has taken place on the part of the King.</P>
<P>THE legal capacity of the Hou&s;es to act depends upon their being a&s;&s;embled, which may be prevented by the violence &s;tated; and after &s;uch violence is removed, &s;ome interval of time mu&s;t pa&s;s before they can be legally re|a&s;&s;embled by the Crown; and the term may extend &s;o long, that the Parliament which was in exi&s;tence at its commencement may be brought to an end, by the act of the law, before &s;uch force is removed. But the legal powers of the Crown will not be &s;o extingui&s;hed, although it be impo&s;&s;ible to exert them in act.</P>
<P>BEFORE I con&s;ider the &s;econd part or &s;en&s;e of this Pro|po&s;ition, I tran&s;cribe the pa&s;&s;age in the paragraph in which it is found:
<Q>THEY (the Lords and Commons) are only branches, and derive their origin and nutriment from the com|mon parent; they may be lopped off, and the Tree is a Tree &s;till; &s;horn indeed of its honours, but not, like them, ca&s;t into the fire.</Q>&mdash;I &s;hall afterwards con&s;ider the expre&s;&s;ion, and prove the following, with what has preceded, to be the only &s;en&s;es of it; having made one ob&s;ervation in this place on the &s;tyle: Through the whole of the Letter it is equable, though correct and even ele|gant; without tho&s;e bolder figures which pro&s;e, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, may admit. The pa&s;&s;age which is cen&s;ured,
<PB N="45" REF="47">taken without the la&s;t &s;entence, &s;evered from the follow|ing period, is perfectly in&s;ulated; it looks like a &s;ingle hill &s;tarting up out of a plain, who&s;e &s;urface is indeed waving and diver&s;ified. Thus placed, we meet a pa&s;&s;age highly metaphorical, and continued to a con&s;iderable length: Who would not pronounce in &s;uch a ca&s;e, where a Writer departs from his own manner, that the cau&s;e was &s;ome &s;udden and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, operating at the moment, though he &s;uppre&s;&s;es the mention of it? and there are recent circum&s;tances of that kind dwelling in every man's mind. Is the pa&s;&s;age very different from a portrait of the &s;ituation of Louis XVI. when a limited Sovereign, in the la&s;t year of his reign? Nobility abo|li&s;hed by a law he was compelled to a&s;&s;ent to; and even every man of the Third E&s;tate, di&s;tingui&s;hed by virtue and ability, was driven into exile, or at lea&s;t forced to fly from the A&s;&s;embly: The goodly branches of the Legi&s;lature were lopped off; the Tree remained indeed, in name, a Tree &s;till, &s;horn of its honours, and not <HI>yet</HI> like them ca&s;t into the fire. Or to come to the immediate in&s;tant when we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the paragraph to have been written, Was not the King of France then in exile? her Nobility half exterminated, half begging &s;u&s;tenance in foreign countries? or, Were the Commons of the realm repre&s;ented by the vile in&s;truments of Robe&s;pierre, Barrere, or Tallien? Hence the Writer will be thought to have had at that time before his eye that dreadful calamity, in which the Nobles and the more opulent and re&s;pectable individuals of the commonalty were involved, and the annihilation rapidly advancing upon them; and perhaps his more eager cen&s;urers may become inclined to admit, if they can &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>po&s;&s;ible only</HI> that he wrote with &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, that he did not look upon the philo&s;ophical politics of lopping
<PB N="46" REF="48">and burning, and the &s;ublime proce&s;s of regenerating by annihilating with an uncon&s;titutional approbation. This premi&s;ed, I come to the &s;econd &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The actors of &s;uch violence at any period acquiring permanent power, the Peerage of a country, and the families from which the Third E&s;tate was then taken, may become effectively extinct, while a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings <HI>de jure</HI> may probably be pre&s;erved for many ages.</P>
<P>A FAMILY is &s;aid to be effectively extinct when it has no known repre&s;entative; no one who can e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf to be &s;uch upon proof. We learn from Cae&s;ar that the feudal &s;y&s;tem was e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Gauls, who&s;e in&s;titutions tho&s;e of the Britons perfectly re&s;em|bled. They too had their order of Nobility or Lords<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon's Hi&s;t. Di&s;c.</NOTE>; but their Nobility is totally extinct. And the &s;ame is true of the Saxon Nobility and greater Gentry; we have no Peers with a Saxon title; and few Gentry who can &s;hew them&s;elves de&s;cendants of an opulent Saxon family. Tho&s;e ornamental branches of the Royalty of the Briti&s;h and Saxon line, have, by the violence of the &s;word of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conquerors of the kingdom, been lopped off and ca&s;t into the fire: while the fortune of the parent &s;tem, was little attended to, as we &s;hall &s;ee, on deci&s;ive authority, hereafter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>I do not think that any Deputies of the Commons formed a part of the Saxon Great Councils. He that &s;hall prove this opinion to be erroneous will &s;trengthen the cau&s;e of the Letter-Writer on the one hand, more than he will weaken it on the other, by furni&s;hing a proof that the popular branch may be cut off by violence, and that the monarchical Trunk may preduce a new one, even after the lap&s;e of two Centuries.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">BUT the extermination of the Lords and the greater families of the Commons has not been in this country, and in latter ages, po&s;&s;ible only; it is a danger which, in the opinion of the mo&s;t judicious modern hi&s;torian, Mr. Hume, has been very probable; has been &s;u&s;pended over their heads by a very &s;lender thread indeed. At the end of his account of the Re&s;toration he ob&s;erves, that <Q>the violence of the Engli&s;h Parties exceeded anything we can now imagine; had they continued but a little longer, there was ju&s;t rea&s;on to dread all the horrors of the antient ma&s;&s;acres and pro&s;criptions</Q> from <Q>the military u&s;urpers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 7. p. 339.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IF Providence had at that time vi&s;ited the Nation with this dreadful yet probable calamity, the Writer a&s;&s;erts the tree would have remained a tree &s;till; for it &s;hall be &s;hown that a ca&s;e re&s;embling this is the only one he could have had in contemplation when he wrote. If this tragedy had been effected, it is paying no unde&s;erved tri|bute to the moral &s;en&s;e of the lower orders in this coun|try, to &s;ay, that the perpetrators would have been held in &s;uch execration, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being fa|vourable to a Re&s;toration is no violent a&s;&s;umption. In that ca&s;e, by the legal prerogatives attached to and &s;till re|maining in the per&s;on of the King (according to the Au|thor's a&s;&s;ertions), a Hou&s;e of Peers might have been formed, and by his writs a lawful Hou&s;e of Commons a&s;&s;embled; and he would have been legally able to have formed the wheels, and &s;et together again the whole machine of Government. Thus, by the operation of the Law of the Land, as adequate a remedy as po&s;&s;ible would have
<PB N="48" REF="50">been found for &s;uch a calamity: a better &s;ource to derive it from than the <HI>jus extremae nece&s;&s;itatis;</HI> or the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Civil Government was quite di&s;&s;olved. And only &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, it mu&s;t be granted, the writer had in his eye For when he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch an exter|mination, he mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed it effected by &s;ome agent or agents; by the King, or by rebels, or foreign force. The fir&s;t it is incredible he &s;hould think lightly of; the &s;econd we have recently &s;een at|tempted, and almo&s;t effected; the la&s;t does not enter into the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE King <HI>de jure</HI> (Charles II.) being abroad, would have e&s;caped this calamity; &s;horn of his branches, but not like them ca&s;t into the fire; and in the kingdoms where the principle of Salic Law is not in force, the Royal Families mo&s;tly marrying their daughters to foreign Princes (events of which faithful records are pre&s;erved), are not nearly &s;o liable to become apparently extinct as even the exi&s;ting cla&s;&s;es of Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>A VERY &s;ingular in&s;tance of the truth of this occurs in our own hi&s;tory. The title of the Briti&s;h Sovereigns was in the Welch Princes. By the marriage of Gladys, &s;i&s;ter of Llewellyn ap Jorwerth the Great, their title ultimately fell into the hou&s;e of Mortimer. Thus Ed|ward the IVth united the Norman title in the York line with that of the Briti&s;h Princes. By the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth with Henry, heir of the line of Lanca&s;ter, there was an union of three titles in their de|&s;cendants; which at la&s;t ve&s;ting in tho&s;e of her daugh|ter Margaret Queen of Scotland, the Crown pa&s;&s;ed to James the I&s;t; and in his per&s;on a fourth title was added
<PB N="49" REF="51">to the former three. Margaret daughter of Edward the Outlaw, &s;on of Edmund Iron&s;ide, married to Malcolm King of Scotland: &s;he was &s;i&s;ter to Edgar Atheling, <Q><HI>cui de jure</HI> (&s;ays Matthew Paris) <HI>debebatur regnum An|glorum.</HI></Q> He died without i&s;&s;ue; and thus, after an interval of 586 years, the lineal repre&s;entative of Edmund Iron&s;ide was &s;eated on the Engli&s;h throne; uniting in his &s;ingle per&s;on the claims of the Briti&s;h, the Saxon, the York, and the Lanca&s;ter lines. The particulars of this de&s;cent here given I have taken out of Black&s;tone, b. i. c. 3. He remarks, that this accumulation of titles &s;ug|ge&s;ted to a Prince of more learning than wi&s;dom, that his hereditary title was indefea&s;ible: and it may be added, that tho&s;e of his age, and for a con&s;iderable time after, who were mo&s;t zealou&s;ly attached to our Liberty and Laws, which are ultimately derived from the Saxon race, might, in their affection to the memory of tho&s;e excellent Sovereigns to whom they were indebted for them, think they di&s;covered the immediate hand of Providence in the re&s;toration of this line, and even carry the con&s;equences they deduced from it to an erroneous length.</P>
<P>IN a word, the heir of Edmund Iron&s;ide, Llewellyn the Great, and William the Norman, in the Prote&s;tant line, is now &s;eated on the Throne. But is there a &s;ingle per&s;on to be found in the kingdom who can &s;hew him|&s;elf to be the repre&s;entative of a Briti&s;h or a Saxon Lord? or many who can derive their de&s;cent from the Saxon Gentry? The&s;e cla&s;&s;es have twice become ex|tinct. The repre&s;entative of the dyna&s;ties wears the Crown.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. ON THE DICTION OR EXPRESSION OF THE PARAGRAPH.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to be unu&s;ually particular in the re|marks upon this topic, becau&s;e the circum&s;tance of the Pamphlet being made the &s;ubject of Parliamentary inquiry, &s;eems to me to hang much upon it. The greate&s;t part of it is metaphorical; and one of the metaphors has, I pre|&s;ume, given offence to many of the Members of the Hou&s;e who have voted upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE Lords and Commons are de&s;cribed as branches &s;pringing from the antient &s;tock of Monarchy; the ho|nours of the tree; goodly, and giving it ornament, and affording &s;helter to tho&s;e who take protection under it. Here is much &s;aid of the utility and beauty of the E&s;tates; and the matter of their origination being true, which was proved above, their good qualities are as warmly painted as we u&s;ually find them, and perhaps it may be &s;aid to be more &s;o.</P>
<P>To meet the objection to be con&s;idered afterwards, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that all this imagery is of the &s;chool of the Hebrew poetry: a &s;econdary mark of the peculiar genius of which was, to confine &s;ome particular metaphors almo&s;t exclu&s;ively to certain &s;ubjects; as a cedar, or any maje&s;tic tree, to expre&s;s a King or Prince. The image is of this &s;ort. If any one &s;hould &s;ay that its proximate &s;ource is to be found in Shake&s;pear,
<PB N="51" REF="53">in a poetical compliment to James the I&s;t, I &s;hall not di&s;|pute it with him.</P>
<Q><L>He &s;hall flouri&s;h,</L>
<L>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</L>
<L>To all the plains about him.</L></Q>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t have the liberty of adding Hurd's Note on this pa&s;&s;age: <Q>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee his cedar is not of Engli&s;h growth, but tran&s;planted from Judea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hurd's Horace, v. 3, p. 164.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ubject leads the Writer to add another circum&s;tance to this de&s;cription; the ab&s;tract matter of which is, that the Three E&s;tates may be de&s;troyed, but the Monarch remain. As he began metaphori|cally, this he has rightly expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. Yet in this &s;econd metaphor is to be found one great part, and I believe the principal part, of the ground of the cen&s;ure. This de&s;truction is thus expre&s;&s;ed: <Q>The branches may be lopped off&mdash;and ca&s;t into the fire.</Q> The charge certainly is not weakened by thus removing the&s;e phra&s;es out of their places and putting them into uxta-po&s;ition.</P>
<P>j</P>
<P>IN this metaphor the word <HI>may</HI> is capable of being con&s;trued in two &s;en&s;es; the fir&s;t limited to a &s;imple po&s;|&s;ibility of the thing; the &s;econd, that it is not only po&s;&s;i|ble but right to be done. Now when a word bears two &s;en&s;es (and there are few in common u&s;e which do not), the meaning in which the writer intends to be under&s;tood is to be determined by the context. In which &s;en&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="54">the verb <HI>may</HI> is here u&s;ed, is to be gathered from what he has &s;aid of the qualities of the two branches. Now as their utility and beau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y have been warmly painted, as has been particularly &s;hewn before, it is to be con&s;trued in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, that the branches may eventually or po&s;&s;ibly happen to be lopped off, and ca&s;t into this fire; not that they ought to be &s;o, becau&s;e they do not produce good fruit.</P>
<P>YET in the&s;e two phra&s;es, as they are here put toge|ther, the Writer has copied one verbally, and only made a &s;light alteration in the words of another, from the conclu&s;ion of a beautiful allegory, which is a fine exam|ple of the Hebrew &s;chool: <Q>Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, <HI>is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire.</HI></Q> The words of the latter part of this quotation may recall the former to memory; but it has been par|ticularly &s;hewn above, that the Writer did not mean that the&s;e branches did not bring forth good fruit; for &s;uch fruits he has &s;pecified; and even &s;uppo&s;ing this had not been capable of &s;uch proof, it would be rightly &s;aid, that the adoption of images in this mode, forms a kind of cento in pro&s;e: but when a man is compo&s;ing a cento, if he takes the la&s;t hemi&s;tich of a ver&s;e in Virgil to con|clude his own, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he means the for|mer part to be under&s;tood before it?</P>
<P>BUT it will be a&s;ked, <Q>Was it not enough for this writer to have once expre&s;&s;ed, figuratively, the de&s;truc|tion of the two E&s;tates? Was it not &s;ufficiently de|&s;cribed by the phra&s;e, <HI>they may be lopped off?</HI> Why does he affectedly repeat it, dwelling on the idea, and
<PB N="53" REF="55">add, as if in contempt, <HI>they may be ca&s;t into the fire?</HI></Q> To this it is an&s;wered, that it is that quality of the figurative &s;tyle of the Hebrew &s;chool, which may be called its e&s;&s;ential difference, to give that impre&s;&s;ion to its images by reduplication, which the Europeans effect by epithets. I take this from Lowth's Praelections on the Hebrew Poetry; and I tran&s;late his Latin Exam|ple.&mdash;1&s;t. My in&s;truction &s;hall de&s;cend as a &s;hower;&mdash;2d. My &s;peech &s;hall fall as the dew;&mdash;3d. As the fine &s;howers on the plants;&mdash;4th. As the thick dew drops on the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>I HAVE but a &s;ingle metaphorical &s;entence more in the citation to remark upon. The branches being lop|ped off, <HI>"the tree is a tree &s;till, &s;horn indeed of its honours."</HI> How he formed the idea has been pointed out before; it mu&s;t now be &s;hown where he had his colouring. This ima|gery has a different &s;ource from the former; but blends very well with it. Here we may infallibly detect the pa&s;&s;age or pa&s;&s;ages of a great Poet whom the writer had in his eye; and they will give us the picture then pre|&s;ent to his mind, of the &s;tate of a monarch who&s;e greater &s;ubjects were involved in &s;uch utter ruin. The impre&s;|&s;ions they make upon us were the impre&s;&s;ions he felt when he wrote, and endeavoured to excite in us by the allu&s;ion to be pointed out. I need not quote Hurd's 5th or 6th marks of imitation, to prove that the phra&s;e "&s;horn of its honours" is borrowed from Milton; it &s;ugge&s;ts to us directly the picture
<Q><L>Of glory ob&s;cur'd; as when the &s;un, new ri&s;en,</L>
<L>Looks through the horizontal mi&s;ty a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</L>

<L>On half the Nations; <HI>and with fear of change</HI></L>

<P>AND in the &s;ame page, fifteen lines further, by the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re change of the &s;ingular number for the plural, we read,
<Q><L>How he &s;tands.</L>

<L>With finged top his &s;tately growth, though bare,</L>
<L>Stands on the bla&s;ted heath.</L></Q></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages the Writer mo&s;t probably took the whole of that here con&s;idered; <Q>the tree is a tree &s;till, &s;horn indeed of its honours</Q> (branches); and the latter might &s;ugge&s;t to him to add what immediately follows, "but not like them ca&s;t into the fire." The fir&s;t &s;entence of the pa&s;&s;age quoted is left &s;imple, pro|bably to avoid the appearance of &s;ervile imitation, or the giving to the whole an air of poetry too much above the cu&s;tomary &s;tyle in which &s;ubjects of the nature of his pamphlet are generally treated.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion I draw from the whole is, that in this paragraph we have the advantages of the two Hou&s;es fairly &s;tated, and the dignity of the Sovereign more fully in&s;i&s;ted on, yet from circum&s;tances proved by general ex|perience and law; and if either of the other two parts of the Con&s;titution had been now attempted to be &s;ub|verted, any one of its advocates (and I hope they would have been numerous, zealous, and able) ought to have proceeded in the &s;ame manner; that is, briefly but fully
<PB N="55" REF="57">acknowledging the utility of the two unattacked parts, then directing all his attention to the defence of the third. Whether it were the Commons or the Lords, it would then be doubtle&s;s pretended, as it is now, when &s;o many engines are at work to weaken or de&s;troy the Crown, that no attack was intended again&s;t that parti|cular part of the Con&s;titution. But it is to be ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to &s;uch ca&s;es, that it has very frequently happened, when one army has marched out of its tren|ches, in the dark, to attack another, they have lighted up every tent to make their adver&s;aries believe that they were very quietly at &s;upper. And if it be &s;till con&s;titu|tional to defend the Government e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, it is con&s;titutional to give a &s;ummary of the Royal pre|rogatives acknowledged by it, and point out their utility. This mu&s;t be allowed by tho&s;e who feel them&s;elves in|clined to &s;top &s;omewhat &s;hort of the doctrine of Black|&s;tone, as the Writer actually has done, who &s;ays, <Q>the ma&s;s of mankind will be apt to grow in&s;olent and re|fractory, if taught to con&s;ider their Prince as a man of no greater perfection than them&s;elves. The law therefore a&s;cribes to the King, in his high political cha|racter, not only large power and emoluments which form his prerogative and revenue, but likewi&s;e certain attributes of a great and tran&s;cendant nature, by which the people are led to con&s;ider him in the light of a &s;uperior being, and to pay him that awful re&s;pect which may enable him with greater ea&s;e to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Government. This (he adds) is what I under&s;tand by the Royal dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 1. p. 241.</NOTE>.</Q> And this de|fence has been &s;o conducted by the Letter-Writer, that the

<HEAD>PART IV. FIRST.&mdash;ON THE REVOLUTION PART OF THE WORK.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW come to con&s;ider what the Letter-Writer has &s;aid on the Revolution; a motion having been made in the Hou&s;e to declare this al&s;o a libel. In the Fir&s;t Part of this Tract it has been &s;hewn, that he had &s;poken of that even with all the warmth of prai&s;e. It certainly therefore is not doing him great ju&s;tice to &s;ever the remainder, which is judged unexceptionable, from that context, and con&s;ider it apart: yet &s;uch is the me|thod here adopted in his defence, mo&s;t favorable to his accu&s;ers, and lea&s;t &s;o to the accu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">OMITTING all tho&s;e kinds of revolutions of States, who&s;e cau&s;es or effects are external, our ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be directed to civil or internal revolutions, and the&s;e are of the following kinds: Fir&s;t, tho&s;e which change the form of Government: Secondly, the gover|nors; the&s;e are &s;imple revolutions: or, in the third place, both conjointly, or compound revolutions. Infinite varieties fall under the third head. As for in&s;tance, a compound revolution may fix a new Dyna&s;ty upon the throne, and the fir&s;t principles of the old form of Go|vernment and the Laws may undergo a very great or total change. Or it may fix a family derived from a new common &s;tock upon the throne; while the changes in the form of the old Government and the Laws are much le&s;s than in the former ca&s;e; and &s;uch as do not, <HI>per &s;e,</HI> approach to a revolution of the other kind.</P>
<P>EVERY friend of legal liberty mu&s;t unre&s;ervedly ap|prove of the tran&s;actions which placed William and Mary on the throne, as ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary; but fully im|pre&s;&s;ed with that &s;entiment, men may &s;o far differ as to number the Revolution among events either of the fir&s;t or the &s;econd kind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in &s;o doing, traduce or libel the Revolution.</P>
<P>THERE are authorities on both &s;ides; I &s;hall &s;tate what I look upon as the be&s;t, and begin with tho&s;e for the fir&s;t opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60"><Q>IN the Declaration of Rights (Mr. Hume &s;ays) all the points which had of late years been di&s;puted be|tween King and People, were finally determined; and the powers of the Royal Prerogative were more nar|rowly circum&s;cribed, and more exactly defined, than in any former period of the Engli&s;h Government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 8. p. 309.</NOTE>.</Q> It does not indeed follow from this that the di&s;putable points were many or few; the remedy of more or le&s;s ex|tent; the change of the legal form of Government con|&s;iderable only, or intitled to be called a total change therein. His idea of the magnitude of that change is to be found in the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q>That great event (the Revolution) not only put a period to the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart, but made a new &s;et|tlement of the whole Con&s;titution<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. v. 8. p. 310.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I LOOK upon the opinion, that we had no Con&s;titu|tion until the Revolution, or that <HI>that</HI> event drew it out of the chaos in which it was involved, to have been derived from the&s;e and &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Hume's works; at lea&s;t I know no other re&s;pectable &s;ource of &s;uch an opinion. According to that, we are to &s;uppo&s;e that he under&s;too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Declaration or Bill of Rights to be the "Corinthian capital<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burke on the French Revolution.</NOTE>" wanted &s;till to fini&s;h that column of Briti&s;h Freedom, the Con&s;titu|tion, and complete the mo&s;t beautiful ordonnance that human art had ever formed. Yet, on this occa&s;ion, he only &s;ays of it, at &s;uch a time &s;uch a member was put upon the top of the &s;haft, without any account of its form or proportion; while he de&s;cribes certain parts of
<PB N="59" REF="61">the pede&s;tal and ba&s;e, and their mouldings and orna|ments, with the mo&s;t minute detail and attention. I &s;ay, if he thought thus of the Bill of Rights, contrary to his ordinary manner, he has, in the body of his Hi&s;tory (which concludes with the fir&s;t quotation), given only &s;even lines to an account of it in general terms. On the occa&s;ion of &s;ome former ameliorations of the Con|&s;titution, which he mu&s;t have e&s;teemed as of much le&s;s con&s;equence, he has been infinitely more particular. His known manner is, on treating on &s;uch &s;ubjects, to &s;tate every topic that could be urged by a profound politician on both &s;ides, and he practically &s;hews us, that Tacitus has been indebted to warm imaginations for &s;ome part of the prai&s;es he has received. And would not &s;uch a wri|ter have been glad to have concluded his Hi&s;tory with &s;o fine and &s;o important a clo&s;e, as a fini&s;hed di&s;&s;ertation on the vicious redundances which remained to be taken away, and the improvements to be adopted, to complete a Con&s;titution held in &s;uch e&s;teem, by a Declaration of Rights, claimed on a change of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne? Does he not &s;corn thus even to apply a capital to the be&s;t column of his own immorta|lity? In&s;tead of doing this, we find no one article of its contents, not one argument for or again&s;t it; he con|den&s;es the account of it into a &s;ingle period of &s;even lines; while to the Petition of Rights, brought forward in the reign of Charles the Fir&s;t, the articles of which are not &s;o many in number, he has given twenty pages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 6. pp. 277-196 inclu&s;ive.</NOTE>; containing the Petition at length, &s;ome full and fine ex|tracts from the debates, and an elaborate di&s;&s;ertation of his own for and again&s;t it. From this circum&s;tance
<PB N="60" REF="62">&s;ome people may be inclined to think, that he felt he could not give the Declaration the &s;ame con&s;equence with which he had treated the Petition; though they may keep back their a&s;&s;ent, from the opinion of Macpher&s;on on the former; who &s;ays, <Q>that the Rights that were claimed had been recognized in the mo&s;t arbitrary reigns, though they were &s;ometimes eva&s;ively in|vaded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory, v. 1. p 568.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THAT &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;ubtracted from the weight Mr. Hume's authority gives to the po&s;ition, that the Revolution <Q>made a new &s;ettlement of the whole Con|&s;titution,</Q> in the &s;en&s;e in which it is commonly un|der&s;tood, appears likewi&s;e on another ground. In com|menting on the u&s;urpations and illegal acts of the hou&s;e of Stuart&punc; later authors had thought fit to judge and con|demn them on the laws and the principles now univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed. This proceeding he contends to be analogous to trying a man by an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law. This is true, in many in&s;tances, in re&s;pect to the fir&s;t two &s;overeigns of that family. But he did not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider what great approaches were made in the fir&s;t part of the reign of Charles the Second toward that Con&s;titution we have now the happine&s;s to enjoy. Hence, in the la&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, he &s;eems to hold out the idea, that the nation pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>per &s;altum,</HI> at a &s;ingle &s;tep, from the old and con|fu&s;ed &s;y&s;tem, almo&s;t as it exi&s;ted under the la&s;t of the Tudors, to the new and &s;ettled form of Government. His ground for an apology for the hou&s;e of Stuart is happy, but his affection for it has drawn him to a cer|tain length into the error oppo&s;ite to that which he attacks; and although his deviations be by no means &s;o
<PB N="61" REF="63">gro&s;s as tho&s;e of the writer's he has in his eye, yet to con&s;ider how he fell into them leads us directly to the authority on which the que&s;tion before us ought to be decided: this inquiry I therefore now enter upon.</P>
<P>IF, as it is laid down above, great improvements had been made in Legi&s;lation during the former part of the reign of Charles the Second; yet as they were brought forward &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and not in a ma&s;s, under a &s;ingle &s;tatute, like the Petition of Right in 1628, they mu&s;t be found &s;cattered up and down among facts of that event|ful period, which were more &s;triking to the imagination of the reader, and even that of the hi&s;torian. When the mi&s;cellaneous materials of hi&s;tory are &s;o joined together, he is not able by a retro&s;pective glance upon the a&s;&s;em|blage of all of them to obtain a di&s;tinct view of one cla&s;s of events; as for example, the changes of the &s;pirit or letter of Laws. To give a preci&s;e idea of the&s;e intere&s;ting particulars, proper epochs mu&s;t be &s;elected in the cour&s;e of a Hi&s;tory, and at each term the &s;tate of the Laws &s;hould be accurately delineated; then the varia|tion from term to term &s;hould be truly and carefully a&s;&s;igned, and it &s;hould be &s;hewn, by way of re&s;ult, whether they were in a gradual &s;tate of improve|ment, or the contrary. The&s;e periodical reviews, or balances, Mr. Hume has not drawn out; but admit him to have attempted it, it is certain he would have been much better qualified for the ta&s;k, if that acutene&s;s and judgment in which he excelled had been principally employed in the &s;tudy of the &s;tatute books, and the whole theory, practice, and hi&s;tory of our Laws. He then would have been intitled to entire credit with re|gard to what he had &s;aid on the change of the legal Con|&s;titution
<PB N="62" REF="64">at the acce&s;&s;ion of King William, on the maxim, <HI>Cuilibet &s;u&acirc; in arte credendum.</HI></P>
<P>Now what Hume omitted, and what he was not, from a long and nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of &s;tudy, &s;o well able to effect, has been done by Judge Black&s;tone, at the end of his Commentaries on the Laws of England. After he had recently fini&s;hed a full &s;y&s;tematical account of the whole, he gives a hi&s;tory of the variations the Law has under|gone, divided into periods, as above de&s;cribed. The reign of Charles the Second forms a period by it&s;elf, and the fifth in order; and from &s;o complete a view of the &s;ubject he lays it down, that <Q>the Con&s;titution of Eng|land had arrived to its full vigour, and the true balance between Liberty and Prerogative was happily e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in the reign of King Charles the Second<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 4. p. 439.</NOTE>;</Q> <Q>wicked, &s;anguinary, and turbulent,</Q> as he had before admitted it to have been. He adds, in a note below, that <Q>the point of time at which he would chu&s;e to fix this <HI>theoretical</HI> perfection in our public Law, is in the year 1679; though tho&s;e which followed it were times of great practical oppre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q> And in the la&s;t para|graph of his work, he &s;tates that our Laws and Liberties were totally eclip&s;ed at the Norman Conque&s;t, and <Q>were  not thoroughly and completely regained till after the Re&s;toration of King Charles; nor fully and explicitly acknowledged and defined till the aera of the happy Re|volution<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 442.</NOTE>.</Q> Tho&s;e liberties, when they were fully and completely regained, were then as &s;ecurely ours as law, in the turbulent &s;tate of &s;ociety which then ob|tained, could render them; and the explicit acknowledge|ment
<PB N="63" REF="65">of &s;ome pre-exi&s;ting laws and their principles can|not be con&s;idered as even a change of them; it cannot amount to new-modelling a Con&s;titution; or what Mr. Hume (as quoted above) calls a new &s;ettlement of the whole Con&s;titution: nor is &s;uch a change to be found in the improvement of a definition. The greate&s;t alteration made in the Law was, that the King &s;hould be of the Prote&s;tant religion. Otherwi&s;e, the Bill of Rights, though contain|ing matter of great con&s;equence, was ab&s;olutely decla|ratory; &s;tating certain points either to be already the Law of the Land, or contradictory thereto. In a word, the Con&s;titution of England, as exi&s;ting in 1679, &s;tood on the footing of Law in 1688; and if we admit with Black&s;tone, that it had attained theoretical perfec|tion at the fir&s;t period, I &s;hould hold it <HI>a libel on the Revolution</HI> to &s;ay after Mr. Hume, that a new &s;ettlement was then made of the whole, or that any other Con&s;titu|tion was then e&s;tabli&s;hed. What then was the Revolu|tion, as it affected the Con&s;titution? A &s;ucce&s;sful re|&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an attempt to overthrow the &s;y&s;tem of Government e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws. And what is it now to act upon Revolution principles? To re&s;i&s;t all attempts, whether popular, ari&s;tocratical, or regal, to &s;ubvert &s;uch Government. The Revolution was the con&s;ervation of the Con&s;titution already e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, which was arrived at &s;uch perfection, that any attempts, by violence, at a &s;uppo&s;ed improvement of it, would have been in the highe&s;t degree criminal.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent general intere&s;t in the que&s;tion, how far the Revolution was a change of the pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed form of Government and of the Laws, has led me into a con|&s;iderable length, perhaps more than nece&s;&s;ary, from my
<PB N="64" REF="66">direct object. In what precedes, however, it will be found, that the principles, on which what the Author of the Letter has &s;aid on the Revolution, which &s;eems to have given offence, may be ju&s;tified at their full extent. I come now to their application. It is not of the na|ture of a Con&s;titution to be free from the attempts of external force: but &s;o early as the year 1679, that <Q>of England had arrived to its full vigour, and the true balance between liberty and prerogative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bl. v. 4. p. 439.</NOTE>.</Q> The people had &s;ufficient power, re&s;iding in <Q>their own hands, to a&s;&s;ert and pre&s;erve that liberty if invaded<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 440.</NOTE>;</Q> as the event proved in 1688. The Con&s;titution therefore wanted neither formation nor e&s;tabli&s;hment; the exertion of power already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was become, indeed, highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary; it was well exerted, and the Con&s;titution was &s;aved. Hence the Letter-Writer ju&s;tly reprobates tho&s;e who, di&s;gui&s;ing other principles under the name of Re|volutional, "idolize a Revolution in the ab&s;tract<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Let. p. 40. l. 25.</NOTE>;" that is, any change of governors or legal forms of Govern|ment; tho&s;e who <Q>have no love for the <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> but for that which was <HI>formed at the Revolution,</HI></Q> previou&s;ly to which it was perfectly formed, and, according to the opi|nion of Black&s;tone, e&s;tabli&s;hed in full vigour, and before James the Second a&s;cended the throne; and hence the Author very rightly laughts at the <Q>di&s;appointment and di&s;comfiture of the&s;e idolizers of a Con&s;titution &s;up|po&s;ed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Revolution, on di&s;co|vering, at length, that they have be&s;towed their ap|plau&s;e and affection upon &s;hreds and patches of old date<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Let. p. 53. 11.</NOTE>,</Q> which they &s;o o&s;tentatiou&s;ly affect to de&s;|pri&s;e,

This has been cited before for another purpo&s;e; but I may &s;ay here, that on &s;uch authority the Letter-Writer might very well pronounce of the politicians de&s;cribed above, <Q>that if they had lived in the wicked reigns of Charles the Se|cond and James the Second, they would have enjoyed in <HI>theory,</HI> though not in <HI>practice,</HI> (and theory, of the two, is more con&s;idered by modern reformers,) as good a Con&s;titution as they have had &s;ince, with the &s;ingle exception of a Prote&s;tant King<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Let. p. 53. l. 15.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IN the beginning of the page from which the la&s;t cita|tion is made, he affirms that <Q>the other points, which were twelve in number, were, as I have &s;aid, known to be the Law of the Land before, and were now de|clared and &s;ecured by expre&s;s definition in Parliament.</Q> This was done by the Bill of Rights. The&s;e ob&s;ervations on the effect of the tran&s;actions of that time on the Con|&s;titution, cannot be clo&s;ed without a brief expo&s;ition of the nature of that Bill. Its object, according to the Letter-Writer, was <Q>only, that what had been the recent cau&s;e of alarm, what was &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of all, and what might be thought, from late experience, to be of a nature that required it &s;hould be &s;olemnly inculcated, might be held up for admonition to future

<P>THE &s;pirit with which this Declaration was penned may be gathered from what pa&s;&s;ed at the vote of Abdi|cation, when <Q>the wi&s;er part of the Whigs, at the head of whom was Mr. Sommers, per&s;uaded their Party to make their own &s;entiments of liberty bend to the na|ture of the Con&s;titution, and to the principles of the Tories;</Q> <Q>&s;ome of them having pointed at laying

But on &s;o fair a ground they &s;crupulou&s;ly ab&s;tained from it, and confined them&s;elves to the &s;imple declaration of the letter of the exi&s;ting Con|&s;titution, on tho&s;e points in which it had been endan|gered. The Revolution con&s;i&s;ted in the voluntary abdi|cation of James; his will being demon&s;trated by three overt acts, &s;pecified in the Vote of the Convention; and its proper definition is, a Revolution by Abdication. But as the whole definition is too long, either for con|ver&s;ation or writing, it were to be wi&s;hed, that in giving a &s;horter name to this event, we had formed it upon the language of Parliament, and called it the Abdication. The name contains a moral le&s;&s;on of &s;ufficient &s;trength to any future Prince in&s;tructing him, that a certain period <HI>gravi documento in po&s;terum &s;ancitum fuit; ne quis unquam Populo injuriam opportunam reputaret</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Livy.</NOTE>. It likewi&s;e holds out no equivocal &s;en&s;e, like the term Revolution, which a pernicious demagogue can catch hold of, to &s;ubvert that very Con&s;titution which the tran&s;actions of 1688 &s;aved from &s;ubver&s;ion, intire and without change<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The &s;pirit of Admini&s;tration is a point of great con&s;equence in every Government; but that always depends upon the temper of the governors and that of the people conjointly: it admits no &s;pecific definition, any more than the &s;everal gradations of light between total darkne&s;s and &s;un-ri&s;e.

<P>AFTER the &s;eizing of the charter of the City of Lon|don, in the reign of Charles the Second, many of the richer Corporations purcha&s;ed new ones. There appears to have been no di&s;po&s;ition to grant them <HI>gratis,</HI> even

The terms of the&s;e new charters were &s;uch as to leave the nomination of the re|pre&s;entatives of tho&s;e Corporations almo&s;t entirely in the power of the Crown. After this wide breach in the Con&s;titution, the &s;ervility of James's fir&s;t and la&s;t Par|liament was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all his purpo&s;es. The charters of the mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s of the Corpo|rations, that is of the poorer boroughs, had not been yet called in. To induce them to a general &s;urrender, he determined to grant new ones without fees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 434.</NOTE>. Under the&s;e new charters the Crown had ultimately the power of nominating to all offices: but to add to this influence in elections, all which fell little &s;hort of ab&s;olute nomi|nation, James in&s;tituted a &s;et of officers, called Regu|lators, to examine the qualifications of electors, and ex|clude all &s;uch as adhered to the Te&s;t and penal &s;tatutes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume, 7.8. p. 255.</NOTE>. The Hou&s;e of Commons then con&s;i&s;ted of 513 members; of which, by this arrangement, 421 would have been effectually nominated by the Crown<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection, p. 385.</NOTE>.

I copy the words of Coke, a cotemporary writer, a zealot for the principles of Whiggi&s;m, and therefore an unexcep|tionable evidence, when cen&s;uring the conduct of that Party. <Q>The <HI>Whigs</HI> were but too forward to congra|tulate the King on his de&s;igns, and in humouring him <HI>in giving him up their charters;</HI> as the Tories, in King Charles's reign, in their abhorrences of the

There then exi&s;ted a numerous body among them who were, to u&s;e the language of the times, "Tories in the Church, and Whigs in the State<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dal. Mem.

But unfortunately that &s;pirit was then ex|tremely prevalent: and the di&s;tribution of rewards by James points out that the agents of this &s;ervice are here rightly a&s;&s;igned. The offices of all the Corporations who&s;e charters were &s;urrendered, had, before this, been filled with tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the Exclu&s;ion Bill: <Q>the&s;e were now turned out with di&s;grace, and tho&s;e who appeared mo&s;t violently again&s;t him were put into the magi&s;tracy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;t. 12 mo. 1725. p. 1197.</NOTE>;</Q> the Corporation of London was filled up with Di&s;&s;enters, and afterwards that of every other town<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 8. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS the King had completed, or nearly completed, the &s;eizing into his own hands the effective nomination

Such were the formidable machines which he had prepared to batter down the bulwarks of the Con|&s;titution. There were likewi&s;e other violations of Law, and u&s;urped powers, which alone would have ren|dered the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued again&s;t him nece&s;&s;ary.

If a Regency had been &s;et up, or the &s;ceptre had been placed in the hands; of Mary, it could not have been maintained. By his arrival William pre&s;erved one integral part of the Con&s;titution from virtual annihilation, the Popular E&s;tate. In little more than a year he was called to a new ta&s;k; the Con&s;titution was again threatened with de&s;truction, by mea&s;ures which would have ended in the abolition of Royalty, and he pre&s;erved it, by an act of the greate&s;t political courage and vigour (the di&s;&s;olution of the Parlia|ment which had placed him on the Throne), from becoming a turbulent Democracy.</P>

<P>IT is in the Common Law and Statutes alone that we are to &s;earch for the rules which regulate the actions of our Governors <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> or for the Con&s;titution. Prote&s;tants &s;earch for the principles of their religion only in the letter of the Revelation; and Engli&s;hmen for the principles of the Con&s;titution in the letter of the Law. It is not acce&s;&s;ible in the original, indeed, to every one, to whom &s;ome knowledge of tho&s;e principles is nece&s;&s;ary. Expo&s;itors and Commentators are of high utility, but their authority is to be e&s;timated exclu&s;ively by the care with which they follow the letter of the&s;e originals, and explain with equal accuracy, fullne&s;s, and force, what regards the con&s;tituent powers of the Con&s;titution. The real Con&s;titution, and the hi&s;tory of its variations, are finely delineated in Black&s;tone's Commentaries; and although I would not &s;ub&s;cribe to everything he lays down, where he comes to treat certain parts of the &s;ubject philo|&s;ophically, yet a diligent &s;tudy of this work I e&s;teem as
<PB N="80" REF="84">the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t the flux and reflux of popu|lar errors, which at different pa&s;t periods have made the general idea of the Con&s;titution &s;hift like a loo&s;e &s;and|bank.</P>
<P>THERE are other &s;chools in which this knowledge is &s;ometimes &s;ought. Debates in Parliament will have their u&s;e in giving perfection and ornament to it. But here con&s;iderable caution is required: they are to be read as the arguments of Advocates in a court, giving the mo&s;t &s;pecious dre&s;s to the &s;ide on which they are re|tained; not as the judgment of the Bench. When the State is divided into Parties, either of them will tell you this is true of their opponents. But there is one caution here particularly nece&s;&s;ary: when we are examining the argu|ments of the Party who <HI>propo&s;ed</HI> any law, we ought to in&s;pect very clo&s;ely whether the principles they lay down do not extend farther than the actual law it&s;elf; for to the principle, in that extent, that law has given a tacit negative: it is therefore uncon&s;titutional. And I believe an ob&s;ervance of this caution would have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in embryo many very brilliant remarks on the nature of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE Codes which contain our civil and religious duties are liable to the &s;ame abu&s;es of mi&s;interpretation: the Con&s;titution has its Methodi&s;t Preachers. There were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y enthu&s;ia&s;ts formerly, who could &s;ee nothing in the Laws but what made for the Royal power. There were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lawyers of this cla&s;s formerly, and there is a nume|rous body of ignorant fanatic Preachers now belonging to it, who re&s;olutely overlook all the&s;e texts, and can &s;ee nothing but what exalts the popular branch of the
<PB N="81" REF="85">Government over the other two. There is likewi&s;e an|other &s;et of profe&s;&s;ors of Con&s;titutional Science, formed upon the model of the Socinians, who now u&s;urp the name of Rational Divines. The&s;e men borrow a good deal from the &s;chool of the Metaphy&s;ical Politicians, whom I &s;hall pre&s;ently notice. The&s;e expo&s;itors of the Law and Con&s;titution thus furni&s;hed the plan of their relations, the Divines. The profe&s;&s;ional man of this &s;ect, when he finds anything in his book which will not &s;quare with them, cuts the knot by affirming it is not Law; becau&s;e Law being the perfection of rea&s;on, mu&s;t concur with his rea&s;on. And &s;ometimes he goes an|other way to work; impo&s;ing his own &s;en&s;e upon the words of Law; for which purpo&s;e he has a private code of verbal critici&s;ms, which the grammarians who have &s;een it, declare to be &s;o profound as to &s;urpa&s;s their com|prehen&s;ion. At &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons the whole weight of popu|lar favour will be &s;o flung into one &s;cale, as almo&s;t to over&s;et the balance of the Con&s;titution; and at other times it &s;hall be ca&s;t into the other. The error of the Multitude is always called by them a Con&s;titutional Truth. At &s;uch times he will obtain the reputation of a Con&s;ti|tutional Lawyer, who flings his whole weight into the overloaded &s;cale.</P>
<P>LAST, but not for their inferiority in rank to either of the preceding cla&s;&s;es, we may place the Metaphy&s;ical Politicians. And the&s;e are divided into two &s;ects: one, &s;etting out from the doctrine of the good effects of union of power, concenter it ab&s;olutely; the other, now, from the abu&s;e of it, di&s;per&s;e it to the utmo&s;t, by equali&s;ing every man's &s;hare. The&s;e walk in the <HI>"via regia,"</HI> the "high <HI>priori</HI> road" of the &s;cience of politics; and make
<PB N="82" REF="86">a &s;hort cut to all their conclu&s;ions, by the u&s;e of cer|tain things called Ab&s;tract Principles; and of the&s;e they prepare the bread of life for the Con&s;titution. Now an ab&s;tract principle is a thing very like a Ca&s;|&s;ava root; if you grate it, and pre&s;s the virulent juices out of it, it makes a very nouri&s;hing food; but if you u&s;e it without that preparation. it is a poi&s;on. The&s;e philo&s;ophers formerly have gone very &s;lightly through this cour&s;e of manipulation; but now they omit it en|tirely, and the Abb&eacute; Sieyes has condemned it as an <Q>at|taint upon principle.</Q></P>
<P>BUT I pa&s;s from the&s;e men, and the confu&s;ion they have introduced into our notions of the Con&s;titution, to de&s;cribe one dangerous but &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious &s;ource of error, in arguing on it. When we con&s;ider the power of any one of its con&s;tituent parts &s;eparately, and the rea&s;ons urged for it, we may &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, by analogy, that more &s;hould be added to it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">y will, at fir&s;t view, conclude that this is an argument for &s;o doing. But it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ily &s;hewn that this is not conclu&s;ive; for by adding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o any one power. we de&s;troy the pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed balance and proportion of the three: and if the Con&s;titu|tion were good before, if the effect of the change be &s;mall, it is almo&s;t a movement without a motive; if great, it is an evil; it generates a new Con&s;titution, diffe|rent from that found before by experience to be good. The identity of mixed Con&s;titutions depends upon the &s;ame con&s;tituent parts being combined in the &s;ame man|ner and in the &s;ame proportion, like that of a medical compo&s;it on; for if you vary the proportion of the in|gredients of the latter, though you pre&s;erve the num|ber, its effect may greatly vary; in one proportion
<PB N="83" REF="87">the compound may re&s;tore a man to health, in a dange|rous illne&s;s; in another, put an end to his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IT follows from this, that when any man or &s;et of men are charged with wi&s;hing to make a great change in the exi&s;ting Con&s;titution; if they barely declare them|&s;elves friends to a Government by King, Lords, and Commons, they do not thereby di&s;claim that charge. For this purpo&s;e they mu&s;t make an addition to this de|claration, and &s;ay, that each ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame powers they now hold. For a Party who may wi&s;h to bring the Government of Great Britain very near to a Democracy, to an Ari&s;tocracy, or to pure De&s;poti&s;m, with two almo&s;t non-effective pageants of power, to &s;up|port the names of its other two con&s;tituent parts, may with equal truth make the &s;ame declaration. Of the equivocation I am de&s;cribing, it is to be feared there are too many in&s;tances. I illu&s;trate this matter farther, by examples taken from our own hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>HENRY the Eighth trampled upon the Lords and Commons; in the reign of Henry the Sixth, during &s;ome time before the civil wars, the Nobility tyrannized over the King and the people; and before Charles the Fir&s;t quitted the metropolis, the Commons had effec|tively reduced the Peers and the King to cyphers; and if any of the&s;e three u&s;urpations had been confirmed by the forms of Law, it would have been a Govern|ment by King, Lords, and Commons: but it could not take place now without a &s;ubver&s;ion of the exi&s;ting Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="88">THE defence of the Con&s;titution, as it is now fixed by Law and Cu&s;tom, is and ought to be the common center of union, both to tho&s;e who con&s;ider it as arrived at that degree of practical perfection, that no farther expe|riments &s;hould be tried upon it, and tho&s;e who, allow|ing much that is excellent in it, full retain an idea that it might be worth the while to attempt &s;ome farther mode|rate ameliorations of it.

<P>WITH two or three mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall clo&s;e a Tract, that has grown to a much greater length than I expected. I mu&s;t remark on the Letter-Writer, that Calvin did not concur with Beza on the

There is no Divine of the Church of England now, who would &s;peak the language of the former. I have not his works, but I find in the Preface to the Clergyman's <HI>Vade Mecum,</HI> that in his An&s;wer to the artful and elegant work of Cardinal Sadolet again&s;t the fir&s;t Reformers, he cer|tainly does <Q>anathematize all tho&s;e who do not revere and pay the mo&s;t profound obedience to that hierar|chy in which Bi&s;hops retain their eminence; but &s;o as to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and depend on him as their Head<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Second Edit.

But of Beza, the Marquis D'Argens informs us, that at the conferences at Poi&s;&s;i, by his declaration again&s;t the Epi&s;copal Government, <Q>he lo&s;t the fine&s;t opportunity po&s;&s;ible of introducing a thorough reformation in the Gallican Church<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jewi&s;h Letters.

We al&s;o find in the Hi&s;tory of Geneva, that the citizens founded a College for the education of foreigners re&s;orting thither; and the cir|cum&s;tance immediately following it is, that the Duke of Savoy and Charles the Ninth of France remon&s;trated &s;trongly with the Republic, that the &s;tudents on their return excited their &s;ubjects to di&s;obedience and &s;edi|tion

We all &s;top &s;hort, by a kind of in&s;tinct, in the inve&s;tigation of facts, the re&s;ult of which will give us pain. His declaration likewi&s;e by no means exculpates tho&s;e who guided their councils. It was perhaps impolitic, when the &s;torm was weathered, to draw a&s;ide the veil attempted to be drawn over the con&s;piracy. The Hugonots had been formed
<PB N="87" REF="91">into &s;omething like an <HI>imperium in imperio</HI> for years; and it is not likely that the di&s;ciples of Geneva &s;hould form a Republic without knowing it. Though I admit, if a man were to &s;et up the frame of a hou&s;e upon my ground, and upon my threatening a pro&s;ecution he were to con&s;ent to remove it, and were to tell me, that when he cut out his timbers into proper &s;cantlings, adapted them to one another, framed and pinned them together, he did not know it was a hou&s;e which he had been fram|ing, and that "he looked upon it in another light," the point &s;eems to me &s;o exceedingly difficult of proof, that I &s;hould not conte&s;t it, though I knew he had been edu|cated in a carpenter's &s;hop.</P>
<P>IT remains to con&s;ider what the Letter-Writer has &s;aid on the late Trials of certain per&s;ons for Trea&s;on. The material part of it is as follows: <Q>They were indeed <HI>acquitted by a Jury,</HI> but they have been &s;ince found <HI>guilty by their Country, on the evidence</HI> of the pro|ceedings at the Trial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let. p. 73. l. 24.</NOTE>.</Q> This is fir&s;t brought as a proof, that he does not treat Juries with due reverence. I &s;ub&s;cribe without he&s;itation to their ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, as I do to our mode of making Laws; but as I do not &s;up|po&s;e my&s;elf treating the Legi&s;lature of the kingdom with contempt, when I find fault with a law enacted by it, which mu&s;t have been &s;o often debated, and have received three &s;uch important &s;anctions, every Engli&s;hman has &s;ure|ly the full right to treat the verdict of a Jury, decided at once, with the &s;ame freedom, without an impu|tation of want of reverence for that excellent in&s;titu|tion. The voice of the Law it&s;elf is on this &s;ide. To
<PB N="88" REF="92">guard our liberties, and in tenderne&s;s to per&s;ons arraign|ed, no &s;econd trial takes place in criminal ca&s;es at the &s;uit of the Crown; but it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Juries are more infallible when &s;itting on &s;uch cau&s;es than in civil ca&s;es, in which the Law it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es that they may give a verdict contrary to evidence, by allowing a new trial in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Jury mentioned before were acknowledged by the Judge to have di&s;played "the mo&s;t unwearied attention "and the mo&s;t diligent inve&s;tigation." They al&s;o brought in their verdict after much private deliberation. But what does this amount to? That they went through all the forms of bu&s;ine&s;s with the &s;tricte&s;t attention to decorum. The point where he &s;topped directs the at|tention decidedly to what he was &s;ilent upon. I think to remember having ob&s;erved this when I fir&s;t &s;aw the words. It is a "&s;ilence that &s;peaks;" and I think on the &s;ide of the Letter-Writer. Do not Judges frequently expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction at a verdict? and did this Judge appear to have been backward in giving approbation where he could do it with propriety? The&s;e con&s;truc|tions of &s;ilence, when certain decorums impo&s;e it, are at lea&s;t as old as Menander, whom I quote in the margin, and who ob&s;erves, "they &s;peak <HI>many things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> S. Poetae Men. p. 489.</NOTE>." And if the authority of a Poet will not do, we may bring that of an Hi&s;torian; that when by the &s;tate of political affairs great men are induced to &s;how &s;ome things and keep others back, the public attention is &s;trongly called to the latter. Was not the memory of Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius im|pre&s;&s;ed upon every Roman's mind mo&s;t &s;trongly, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="89" REF="93">the di&s;cretion of one of their de&s;cendants con|cealed their &s;tatues on a well-known occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>LET the que&s;tion now be con&s;idered in another point of light. We are to ob&s;erve that the word Evidence bears, in common conver&s;ation, two &s;en&s;es; according to the &s;pecies thereof con&s;idered; hi&s;torical or judicial evidence. The evidence may be enough to make any man believe the exi&s;tence of a plot, or come up to the point here called hi&s;torical; but it may fall &s;hort of that degree of &s;trength the Law requires to take away the life of an in|dividual, or judicial evidence. And where the evidence is only of the fir&s;t magnitude, or (as it may do) where it much exceeds the weight required by the fir&s;t, but &s;till falls &s;hort of the &s;tandard of the &s;econd, the Public MUST condemn, and the Jury MUST acquit; each with the &s;ame matter before them. The national tran&s;actions with foreign Nations in peace and war, are &s;olely guided by the fir&s;t &s;pecies of evidence. Senates proceed in their de|clarative deci&s;ions on the fir&s;t &s;pecies of evidence, when they think the State in danger, to give the watch-word to the People: Courts of Ju&s;tice on the &s;econd. If nothing but judicial evidence were hi&s;torical evidence, hi&s;tory mu&s;t be a blank, or at lea&s;t half the in&s;tructive, le&s;&s;ons it holds out to mankind mu&s;t be blotted out: and upon that evidence men mu&s;t &s;peak, or be reduced to mutes.</P>
<P>JURIES are adjuncts to the Royal Executive Power; and the Letter-Writer is charged with having &s;aid that they may be "lopped off" without detriment to the State. But in effect, he nowhere &s;uppo&s;es the axe ap|plied
<PB N="90" REF="94">to this &s;ub&s;idiary and occa&s;ional power at all: and when in other ca&s;es he &s;uppo&s;es it to be applied, he repre&s;ents the monarchical trunk as being in con&s;e|quence "&s;horn of its honours;" and if he holds the latter may be done without detriment to the State, he is a Republican; if both conjointly, an Anarchi&s;t. But I have never heard that the &s;uppo&s;ed Author of the Let|ter holds any &s;uch political here&s;ies, which I am &s;ure are not to be found there. It is true, however, that when the kingly power was in this country <Q>&s;horn of its honours,</Q> Juries, in ca&s;es then called ca&s;es of High Trea&s;on, were "lopped off." We are expre&s;sly told, that Cromwell and the Parliament &s;et them a&s;ide, and erected "High Courts of Ju&s;tice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 7. p. 208, 209.</NOTE>." And to &s;uper&s;ede them in like manner, very &s;oon after they were introduced, the French Republicans copied this precedent in their Revolutionary Tribunals; and if the &s;ame Republican u&s;urpation &s;hould again take place in this country, Juries may be once more <Q>lopped off.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is another charge of a &s;imilar formation brought again&s;t what the Writer has &s;aid on the late Verdicts. A great Orator has been made in the public papers to declare, that it is a&s;&s;erted in the Letter, that <Q>the verdict of Juries is not a final deci&s;ion in trials at Bar.</Q> This I have not &s;een there; no more did he, if by Bar he means the legal Bar. But there is another and an awful Bar, at which &s;uch verdicts have been often &s;et a&s;ide, as contrary to evidence; that of impartial po&s;terity;
<PB N="93" REF="95">that of hi&s;tory; that even of the men who live at the time when they are given, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erment attending &s;uch a cau&s;e has &s;ub&s;ided; for even this la&s;t mu&s;t be granted, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e truth to be a volatile ingre|dient like camphor, which being mixed in that com|pound called a verdict, it &s;hall thus retain, as to &s;en&s;e, the full odour thereof for a given time or number of years; &s;mell faintly for a &s;econd term; and be quite flat always afterwards.</P>
<P>YET if we grant this, as highly probable, to tho&s;e who contend for this philo&s;ophical hypothe&s;is, they mu&s;t, according to their own principles, at the &s;ame time admit it to be po&s;&s;ible, that it may be &s;ome|times infu&s;ed therein in a liquid form like aether; and in ca&s;es where the ingredient is only &s;o blended in the compound, a man &s;hall appear as the innocent victim of State per&s;ecution to-night, and be univer&s;ally believed an acquitted felon to-morrow; for evaporate this aether will. You may as ea&s;ily fix "Hermes," which it is known cannot be done without the powder of precipita|tion. I have &s;aid it before, and I repeat it again, Juries are of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to guard &s;ubjects again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of governors: but it does not follow that any dozen of reputable &s;hop-keepers, or farmers, or mer|chants, or e&s;quires, in his Maje&s;ty's dominions, are jointly ve&s;ted with the &s;ublime gift of infallibility. The &s;ublime&s;t monuments of human wi&s;dom and virtue are di&s;honoured by being prai&s;ed for what they are not. When we find them dre&s;&s;ed out in &s;uch fanta&s;tical at|tributives, we &s;u&s;pect, perhaps, the de&s;ign of &s;uch need|le&s;s extravagance, but we directly &s;trip off the frippery.

<P>To return to the doctrine I am con&s;idering; which is, that the verdict, which is deci&s;ive in a trial, &s;hould decide every man's opinion. Tho&s;e who hold this doctrine are prepared, I &s;uppo&s;e, to defend the legality of the deci&s;ion on Algernon Sidney, and all the ver|dicts in the war of legal murders carried on by both the factions in the latter end of the reign of Charles the Second. To me it appears, that during all the time in the la&s;t century, in which the Republican Party appeared vi&s;ibly in exi&s;tence and in action, until it dwindled into ob&s;curity, the political Trials by Jury form no ornament to the page of our hi&s;tory: a brilliant exception or two may, however, be alledged.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons I think the Letter-Writer guilt|le&s;s, <HI>in toto,</HI> of all the charges I have &s;een brought again&s;t him. If the Public attributes the work to the true Author, it is every man's duty, who thinks as I do of his pa&s;t merits and the general importance of his political character, and who has opportunities, to take up his defence.</P>
<P>THIS Tract was &s;ent to the pre&s;s without the Writer's being able to read the whole together. He had the choice of abiding the cen&s;ures of all inaccu|racies &s;o cau&s;ed; or to have delayed the publication
<PB N="95" REF="97">too long; and he has cho&s;en the former, becau&s;e on all &s;uch occa&s;ions, that little &s;acrifice ought to be made. It ought, al&s;o, to be announced; becau&s;e, in &s;uch a circum&s;tance, a Writer is intitled to certain allowances.</P>
