<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A SINCERE wi&s;h to benefit the com|munity, by furni&s;hing its mo&s;t ancient, mo&s;t con&s;titutional, and mo&s;t u&s;eful officer with a compendious &s;y&s;tem or manual of his duty and powers, carefully extracted from, and upon an actual peru&s;al of the be&s;t autho|rities, has produced the following &s;heets,&mdash;a mere epitome, in fact, of the original com|pilation. But the utility of the mea&s;ure &s;eemed, upon &s;econd thoughts, to be more favoured by a pamphlet, affording the fulle&s;t information in the narrowe&s;t compa&s;s, than by a volume, which the verbo&s;e prolixity of mo|dern &s;tatutes, vying, as it were, with each other in conveying the &s;imple&s;t regulation in the mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing manner, and greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible number of words, would have ex|tended to a &s;ize and price little calculated to invite the cla&s;s of readers for whom it was principally intended. The deci&s;ion, therefor, was in favour of the briefe&s;t &s;ummary; &s;uch a one as men who have little money, lei&s;ure, or capacity (one or other, or, indeed, all of
<PB N="iv" REF="9">which are, unfortunately, too often met with in the compo&s;ition of a modern con&s;table) might buy, read, and, if po&s;&s;ible, under&s;tand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall tract publi&s;hed under the direction of "the &s;ociety (as it is called) for carrying into effect the kings proclamation," &s;ince the following pages were prepared for the pre&s;s, has not appeared to &s;uper&s;ede the pre&s;ent attempt. Of former publications on the &s;ubject it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that all or mo&s;t of them have been looked into.</NOTE>. The language, however, is generally that of the authority quoted; and the books referred to (which it may be occa&s;ionally nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult) are to be found in many book&s;ellers &s;hops, and in the libraries of the four law &s;o|cieties: few barri&s;ters, at the &s;ame time, are without all or mo&s;t of them; and &s;ome ju&s;|tices of peace, it is pre&s;umed, may po&s;&s;e&s;s "The Statutes at Large." It is undoubtedly a &s;erious con&s;ideration, that the per&s;ons and property of almo&s;t all but profe&s;&s;ional men &s;hould be &s;ubjected to laws which they are totally ignorant of, and do not even know where to find, or how, unle&s;s by dear-bought and fatal experience, to get acquainted with; and of which the mere &s;tudy is &s;ufficient em|ployment for the be&s;t part, if not the whole, of a long life. The&s;e "Statutes at Large," which, while they pre&s;erve many acts that are
<PB N="v" REF="10">not, and many more that ought not to be, in force, do not contain above half the number that are actually &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The private and local acts, every where in force and no where to be met with, are at lea&s;t as numerous. "How is this?" exclaimed a lawyer one day, "why all the&s;e proceedings of yours are manife&s;tly illegal; con|trary to <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> to the Bill of Rights, to the li|berty of the &s;ubject, to &mdash;." "Sir," &s;ays his client, who was a churchwarden, "we have got an act of par|liament." And thus it is; every little dirty pari&s;h in the environs of London mu&s;t have a law for it&s;elf. The churchwardens or over&s;eers can provide the money, the attorney wants a job, the ju&s;tice looks forward to the pe|nalties, and the <HI>gemmen of the we&s;try</HI> like authority; an act of parliament is accordingly obtained, and, being an admirable compound of ignorance and knavery, cannot fail of proving exceedingly beneficial to the community. To the &s;tatutes which <HI>are not</HI> and <HI>ought not to be in force</HI> may be added tho&s;e which are altogether doubtful, and, till they come in que&s;tion, cannot be po&s;itively &s;aid either to be in force or not. The drawer of a modern act of parliament &s;eldom troubles him&s;elf about former laws on the &s;ame &s;ubject; he erects the new hou&s;e and leaves the old one &s;tanding. It is a well-known ob&s;ervation of a grave and learned &s;erjeant, that an act of parliament was much wanted to repeal all the laws made for thirty years pa&s;t. This, to be &s;ure, would be pretty well; but a retro&s;pect of two or three hundred would be infinitely better. Lord Coke complains bitterly of the injudi|cious penners of acts of parliament in his time, "over|laden," as he &s;ays, " with provi&s;oes and additions, and many times on a &s;udden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law." Tho&s;e acts, however, which gave &s;uch ju&s;t offence to this truly learned and eminent lawyer, will appear per&s;picuous as light, and "brief as womans love," when compared with the endle&s;s and inextricable parliamentary labyrinths of the pre&s;ent century. See al&s;o 1 Black. Com. 10.</NOTE>, are compri&s;ed in no le&s;s
<PB N="vi" REF="11">than <HI>&s;ixteen clo&s;ely printed quarto volumes;</HI> the Common Law is di&s;per&s;ed through near <HI>two hundred folios,</HI> exclu&s;ive of every other &s;ize, many of which exi&s;t only in a barbarous gibberi&s;h peculiar to the profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was long &s;ince objected as a fault to the profe&s;|&s;ors of the law, that they wrote their reports and books of the law in a &s;trange and unknown tongue, which none could under&s;tand but them&s;elves, to the end that people being kept in ignorance of the law, might the more ad|mire their &s;kill and knowlege, and e&s;teem and value it at a higher price. Preface to Sir John Davis's Reports, publi&s;hed in 1628.</NOTE>: even a very imperfect <HI>abridgement</HI> of it filling no le&s;s than <HI>twenty-four.</HI> This, however, is a com|plaint which has been &s;o frequently and &s;o in|effectually made<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Burnet, near a century ago, pronounced the law "the greate&s;t grievance of the nation." And the great lord Bacon, who complains that the laws were then "&s;ubject to great incertainties, and variety of opi|nions, delays, and eva&s;ions," delivered a formal propo|&s;ition to king James I. for their amendment; and this at a time when the &s;tatutes were in <HI>two</HI> volumes, and, be&s;ide the year books, there were but <HI>four reporters</HI> ex|tant.</NOTE>, that one mu&s;t have pa|tience
<PB N="vii" REF="12">till the mi&s;chief, every day increa&s;ing, &s;hall remedy it&s;elf; till, in &s;hort, "there is A DROP TOO MUCH."</P>
<P>Sir William Black&s;tone ob&s;erves that, con|&s;idering what manner of men are for the mo&s;t part out into the office of con&s;table, it is per|haps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Com. 356.</NOTE>; an ob&s;ervation to which it may be readily con|ceived, the compiler of the following Dige&s;t does not &s;ub&s;cribe. In fact, he has ever re|garded it as equally &s;arca&s;tic, illiberal, and unbecoming; and only to be accounted for by the profe&s;&s;ional character and habits of the writer; who, doubtle&s;s, thought that <HI>law,</HI> like <HI>religion,</HI> being a <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> the <HI>&s;criptures</HI> &s;hould in both ca&s;es be locked up in an <HI>unknown lan|guage</HI> or <HI>unintelligible jargon</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 Com. 322. and Benthams Fragment of Govern|ment, Preface, p. xxxv.</NOTE>; that the <HI>pro|fane</HI> ought to know no more than the <HI>initiated</HI> may think fit to communicate; and that, in &s;hort, the mo&s;t ignorant are the mo&s;t trac|table, and con&s;equently the fitte&s;t for good Chri&s;tians and good &s;ubjects. If the powers which the law has ve&s;ted in the con&s;table be &s;o large, that it is even dangerous he &s;hould know them, why were they given him? why
<PB N="viii" REF="13">are they not taken away? why is he to be puni&s;hed for neglecting duties of which it is be&s;t he &s;hould be ignorant? Would it not be full as well, con&s;idering what manner of men are for the mo&s;t part put into the office of ju&s;tice of peace, if they too were to be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers? This, indeed, it may be, is already the ca&s;e; though they do not on that account &s;eem the le&s;s inclined to abu&s;e them. But wherefor is it that &s;uch "manner of men" are put into the Office of Con&s;table? Becau&s;e upward of a hundred acts of parliament, which few ever &s;ee, and &s;till fewer comprehend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The emperor Caligula, it is &s;aid, cau&s;ed his laws to be written &s;o &s;mall, and placed &s;o high, that, though all might clearly &s;ee, none could po&s;&s;ibly read. The Engli&s;h law is thought by &s;ome to bear in many in&s;tances a great re&s;emblance to the Roman. And it &s;eems a maxim in both, that <HI>ignorantia legis non excu&s;at.</HI> Others have not he&s;itated to &s;ay that Briti&s;h &s;tatutes re&s;emble cobwebs, placed in darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity, for the purpo&s;e of en|trapping the &s;maller flies, in order to glut the <HI>bottled-&s;piders</HI> of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall with their blood. But the&s;e, no doubt, are the ravings of beggered &s;uitors, and con|&s;equently not to be regarded.</NOTE>, added to the arbitrary and capricious deci&s;ions of &s;ome courts, and the ignorance and innovation of others, have redered it &s;o burthen&s;ome, &s;er|vile, vexatious, and expen&s;ive, that they who po&s;&s;e&s;s or u&s;urp the power of filling it, &s;elect
<PB N="ix" REF="14">tho&s;e who have nothing to recommend them but the willingne&s;s with which they receive the yoke, and the patience with which they bear it. The rea&s;on given for this partiality is, that <HI>no</HI> GENTLEMAN can accept <HI>&s;uch an office;</HI> poverty, both in pur&s;e and in &s;pirit, being looked upon as the proper qualification for a con&s;ta|ble. The&s;e &s;ame GENTLEMEN, it &s;hould &s;eem, are <HI>high-mettled hor&s;es,</HI> who would kick and wince, and play the devil, in &s;hort, if you at|tempted to put them in the &s;hafts; the VUL|GAR are <HI>a&s;&s;es,</HI> who tamely &s;ubmit to every in|dignity. But, gentleman or no gentleman, he who can be&s;t afford to lo&s;e his time and mo|ney, who has &s;pirit and ability to &s;u&s;tain fa|tigue, and re&s;olution to oppo&s;e in&s;ult and op|pre&s;&s;ion, is the fitte&s;t per&s;on to di&s;charge the Office of Con&s;table. To confer it, from what|ever motive, upon people of ba&s;e or inferior condition, was long ago reprobated by lord Bacon as "a mere abu&s;e or degenerating from the fir&s;t in&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law Tracts, 183.</NOTE>." And, certainly, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a man who depends upon his daily employment for the daily bread of him&s;elf and his family, and who&s;e time is of cour&s;e the mo&s;t precious, ought to be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e in any court of ju&s;tice why he &s;hould not be
<PB N="x" REF="15">compelled to &s;erve this office; only it would probably co&s;t him more to obtain the deter|mination than he can value his time at. It is, doubtle&s;s, a very &s;candalous in&s;inuation that ju&s;tices of peace, who have &s;ome how or other acquired the power of making con&s;tables, &s;e|lect the meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant by way of magnifying their own wi&s;dom and con&s;e|quence; gems, it is well known, which re|quire no foil to increa&s;e their lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>It is, by no means, a le&s;s abu&s;e, when a per&s;on every way fit for the office is pitched upon, to admit in his &s;tead any worthle&s;s fellow that he can procure, ba&s;e enough to &s;erve the duty for a few guineas. What integrity or pro|priety of conduct can be expected from one who&s;e nece&s;&s;ity renders every &s;hilling that is offered him an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation? The great Shak&s;peare has &s;atiri&s;ed this practice with admirable plea&s;antry, in his play of <HI>Mea|&s;ure for Mea&s;ure,</HI> where he introduces the character of a fooli&s;h &s;ub&s;titute bringing a charge before one of the dukes deputies:</P>
<P><HI>E&s;calus.</HI> Come hither to me, ma&s;ter Elbow; come hither, ma&s;ter con&s;table. How long have you been in this place of con&s;table?</P>
<P><HI>Elbow.</HI> Seven years and a half, &s;ir.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;ca.</HI> I thought, by your readine&s;s in the office, you
<PB N="xi" REF="16">had continued in it &s;ome time.&mdash;Alas! it hath been great pains to you! they do you wrong to put you &s;o oft upon it. Are there not men in your ward &s;ufficient to &s;erve it.</P>
<P><HI>Elbow.</HI> Faith, &s;ir, few of any wit in &s;uch matters: as they are cho&s;en, they are glad to choo&s;e me for them; I do it for &s;ome piece of money, and go through with all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another not over-wi&s;e con&s;table in the Comedy of <HI>Much ado about Nothing;</HI> and again in that of <HI>Loves Labour Lo&s;t.</HI> It is to be hoped &s;uch a character is not &s;o very common now a days.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order be the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, the legi&s;lature would e&s;&s;entially contribute to that end in extending more effectual protection and encouragement to the con&s;table. This would be done by cau&s;ing all the laws which authori&s;e or oblige him to do particular acts, or any way concern the execution of his office, to be reduced into a &s;ingle &s;tatute, conceived in plain intelli|gible language<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A re&s;olution of all the judges would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Something of this kind, it is true, was formerly attempted by a chief ju&s;tice, but being ha&s;tily, carele&s;sly, and every way badly done, was de&s;ervedly re|jected by his brethren.</NOTE>; and by requiring every court, at the election of a con&s;table, to put a
<PB N="xii" REF="17">copy of it into his hands: in order that, hav|ing his power and duty con&s;tantly under his eye, he might be without excu&s;e in neglecting the one, and without danger in exerci&s;ing the other. If it be true that every man who &s;erves the public ought to be paid by the public, it is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t that a duty &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon any one, which, if attended to as it ought to be, would demand the greate&s;t part of his time, not only without making him the &s;lighte&s;t recompence, but even obliging him to be at (what is to him) a con&s;iderable expence; for even the mere "con&s;umption of time, to him who lives by the &s;ale of his time, is equivalent to expence." Suppo&s;e, therefor, that every per&s;on duly elect|ed a con&s;table were, during his continuance in office, not exceeding one year, exempt from all taxes and impo&s;itions; parliamentary, or lo|cal; and, in ca&s;e of actions again&s;t him touch|ing his office (the dread of which is one great ob&s;tacle to its due execution) &s;hould be al|lowed to defend, not <HI>in forma pauperis,</HI> but &s;ome really unexpen&s;ive mode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The defence of actions by an <HI>innocent man</HI> requires the fortune of a <HI>rich one.</HI> Even a <HI>pauper,</HI> who is to &s;wear him&s;elf not worth <HI>five pounds</HI> in the world, will have to provide <HI>ten,</HI> or po&s;&s;ibly <HI>fifty</HI> times that &s;um, to pro&s;ecute or defend his &s;uit.</NOTE> This, if not an
<PB N="xiii" REF="18">adequate compen&s;ation, would be a great re|lief, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, at lea&s;t, an indemnity, to per&s;ons &s;erving the office, would induce them to accept it with cheerfulne&s;s, and ex|ecute it with &s;pirit, con&s;cious that in &s;o doing they were benefiting &s;ociety without injuring them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome parts of the north, the con&s;table is intitled to an ancient <HI>ce&s;s</HI> charged upon certain lands, which has formerly amounted to a pretty con&s;iderable &s;um.</NOTE>. One cannot, however, have the &s;atisfaction to think, that a &s;ugge&s;tion &s;o ad|vantageous both to the community and to the individual, &s;tands the lea&s;t chance of ever pa&s;&s;ing into a law. If, indeed, the propo&s;al were for a productive tax upon con&s;tables, or for the purpo&s;e of making bad wor&s;e, or of heaping oppre&s;&s;ion upon the oppre&s;&s;ed, there would be little fear of its being adopted. This, therefor, is another of tho&s;e &s;elf-re|forming grievances which mu&s;t be patiently &s;uffered to attain their <HI>wor&s;t</HI> &s;tate.</P>
<P>To conclude: If the following pages prove at all in&s;trumental toward making a &s;ingle con&s;table more active, confident, and &s;ecure in the di&s;charge of &s;uch of the powers and duties of his office as are any way beneficial to &s;ociety, (for the le&s;s he attends to the others
<PB N="xiv" REF="19">the better,) the compiler will have rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf that his efforts, though humble, have not been u&s;ele&s;s,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THE origin of the word CONSTABLE, which &s;ome etymologi&s;ts have errone|ously &s;ought for in the Saxon language<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">See Lambard, Sir T. Smith, and others.</NOTE>, is un|doubtedly to be found in the <HI>Comes Stabuli</HI> of the Ea&s;tern empire: hence the <HI>con&s;tabularius, con&s;tabu|lus,</HI> &amp;c. of barbarous Latinity; the <HI>conne&s;table</HI> of the French; the <HI>cone&s;tabile</HI> of the Italians, &amp;<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">See Spelmans Glo&s;&s;ary, <HI>voce</HI> CONSTABULARIU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> This <HI>comes &s;tabuli</HI> was at fir&s;t, as his title imports, no more than prefect or &s;uperintendant of the imperial &s;tables, or, in other words, the emperors ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; but having, in proce&s;s of time, obtained the command of the army, his name, corrupted into <HI>con&s;tabulus</HI> and <HI>con&s;tabularius,</HI> began to &s;ignify a commander; and, with this &s;ignification, appears to have been introduced into England at the Norman Conque&s;t, or, perhaps, &s;ooner; &s;ince, in fact, &s;ome &s;uch officer &s;eems to have been already known un|der the title of <HI>Stallarius.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. THE CONSTABLE (or LORD HIGH CON|STABLE) OF ENGLAND was an officer of the highe&s;t dignity and importance in the realm. He was the leader of the kings armies; and had the cogni|zance of all contracts and other matters touching
<PB N="xvi" REF="21">arms or war<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">13 R. z. &s;t. 1. c. 2. See al&s;o. Madox's Hi&s;tory of the Exchequer, p. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This office, which appears to have been granted by William the Conqueror to Walter earl of Glouce&s;ter, or, according to others, to William Fitzo&s;bern, or Roger de Mortimer, be|came, afterward, hereditary in two different families, as annexed to the earldom of Hereford; and, in that right, after a lap&s;e of near two centuries, (&s;everal per&s;ons enjoying the title and authority in the mean time) was revived, by judgement of law, in the per|&s;on of Edward Stafford duke of Buckingham; but Henry VIII. thinking the office too high and dan|gerous for the hands of a &s;ubject, took the fir&s;t op|portunity of putting an end to it by cutting off his head. Since this period, there has been no lord high con&s;table, except <HI>pro hac vice,</HI> as Robert earl of Lind&s;ey was appointed in 1631 to determine the appeal of lord Rea again&s;t Ram&s;ey, and as &s;ome per&s;on or other is created at the coronation of a king or queen.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. We had al&s;o CONSTABLES OF CASTLES, that is, keepers or governors, &s;o called, of the ca&s;tles of the king or great barons, whom the French term <HI>ch&acirc;tellains,</HI> from the Latin <HI>ca&s;tellani,</HI> and who were frequently hereditary, and by feudal tenure; &s;uch were the con&s;table of the tower, the con&s;table of London, or Baynards-ca&s;tle, the con&s;tables of the ca&s;tles of Dover, Wind&s;or, Che&s;ter, Flint, &amp;c. &s;ome of which offices, though not now hereditary, are re|maining to this day.

<P>It is agreed by Mr. Lamberd<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">On Con&s;tables, 3.</NOTE>, by &s;ir Edward Coke<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">4 In&s;t. 267.</NOTE>, and by &s;ir Matthew Hale<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">2 P.

On the other hand, be&s;ide the au|thority of Coke and Hale, it has been expre&s;sly held from the Bench, that a high con&s;table is not &s;uch an officer, nor con&s;ervator of the peace, whereof the

After all, however, nothing can be more certain than that the con&s;table of the hundred, or high con&s;table, whether he be allowed an officer at the Common Law or not, was in&s;tituted long before that &s;tatute. This curious fact is a&s;certained by a writ or mandate of the 36th year of king Henry III. pre&s;erved in the <HI>Adver&s;aria</HI> to Wats's edition of Matthew Paris, and from which chapters 4. and 6. of the &s;tatute of Wynton are evidently taken, though it has hitherto e&s;caped the notice of every writer or &s;peaker upon the &s;ubject.

<P>&sect; 6. The CONSTABLE OF THE VILL (or PETTY CONSTABLE, as, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the con|&s;table of the hundred, he is frequently called) has been repeatedly acknowleged by the law to be "one of the mo&s;t ancient officers in the realm for the con&s;ervation of the peace<NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot">Popham, 13. and below, p. 1.</NOTE>," and is declared by lord Coke to be as ancient as torns or leets be, and not to have begun about the beginning of E. 3. as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed<NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot">4 In&s;t. 265. His lord&s;hip here alludes to the opinion of Mr. Lambard, who &s;ays, "About the beginning of the reign of K.

An opinion which certainly detracts from the character of Mr. Lambard as an indu&s;trious or judicious antiquary. Lord Bacon, on the contrary, who allows the great antiquity of (petty) con&s;tables, doubts that the high con&s;table was not <HI>ab origine,</HI> and only introduced for conveniency &s;ake "when the authority of the ju&s;tices of the peace [who did not exi&s;t before the fir&s;t year of Edw. 3.] was enlarged by divers &s;tatutes." Law Tracts, 181. An idea equally erroneous.</NOTE>. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,

It &s;hould &s;eem, indeed, from Lambard and others, that where there is a con&s;table as well as a tyth|ingman, headborough, or thirdborough in one and the &s;ame place, the office of the latter is inferior to that of con&s;table. In Shak&s;peares comedy of <HI>Much ado about Nothing,</HI> two of the characters are a "con&s;table" and a "headborough;" but, though it is &s;ufficiently evident that Ma&s;ter Dogherry, the con|&s;table, takes a great deal more upon him than his "comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t|ner." yet as he &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf by much the wi&s;er man, it is not perfectly clear that he was inve&s;ted with any greater degree of authority. It is allowed, however, that where there is only a headborough, thirdborough or tythingman, his of|fice does not at all differ from that of con&s;table. One is, there|for, at a lo&s;s to conceive why the court (Gould J.) &s;hould, on the trial of Power for murder (O. B. Sep. 1789), a&s;k one of the witne&s;&s;es, "What are you, a <HI>con&s;table</HI> or a <HI>headborough? &mdash;A.</HI> I am <HI>headborough</HI> of Aldgate." "Was there <HI>any con&s;ta|ble</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age at that time?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> There was not." Since, the arre&s;t being illegal for want of a <HI>warrant,</HI> it could make no difference what he was, nor whether any con&s;table (&s;up|po&s;ing Aldgate had <HI>both</HI> con&s;table and headborough) were pre&s;ent or not. Sly, the drunken tinker, in the <HI>Taming of the Shrow,</HI> is threatened by his ho&s;te&s;s with the <HI>"third|borough;"</HI> and, the term not being familiar to the London edi|tors, got corrupted into <HI>headborough,</HI> which is evidently in|congruous and ab&s;urd; "<HI>Third, or fourth,</HI> or <HI>fifth</HI> borough," &s;ays he, "I'll an&s;wer him by law." In <HI>Loves Labour Lo&s;t,</HI> Goodman Dall &s;ays, he reprehends the duke own per&s;on, and calls him&s;elf "his grace's <HI>tharborough.</HI>"
Norden, in his <HI>De&s;cription of Cornwell,</HI> p. 30, tells us, that "tythinges have <HI>therdbarows,</HI> in &s;ome places <HI>hedborows,</HI> in &s;ome <HI>borrow&s;heds,</HI> and in the we&s;te partes a tything man." And Ben Jon&s;on, in his <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> introduces the "high con&s;table of Ken|ti&s;h-town," the "headborough" of I&s;lington, the "petty con|&s;table" of Ham&s;tead, the "thirdborough" of Bel&s;i&s;e, and "the high con&s;tables man."

It follows, therefor, that the con&s;table of the hundred neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nor could have exerci&s;ed any more authority within the precinct of the leet, than the con&s;table of one manor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or could have ex|erci&s;ed in another; the manor being, to all intents and purpo&s;es, exempt from and excluded out of the hundred<NOTE N="(30)" PLACE="foot">See 4 In&s;t. 261.

The preeminence, therefor, which the con&s;table of the hundred is &s;uppo&s;ed to have, or may think proper to a&s;&s;ume, over the con&s;tables of manors or town&s;hips within the hundred, is alto|gether unfounded and imaginary, and might, with equal ju&s;tice or propriety, be claimed by the bailiff of the hundred or &s;heriff of the county over the bai|liff of the manor, or, in &s;hort, by any one con&s;table over another who&s;e di&s;trict was more circum&s;cribed; for though, as lord Bacon ob&s;erves, the high con|&s;tables authority hath the more ample circuit, "yet I do not find," &s;ays he, "that the petty con&s;table is &s;ubordinate to the high con&s;table, or to be ordered or commanded by him<NOTE N="(31)" PLACE="foot">Law Tracts, 181.187.</NOTE>."

<P>&rindx; Of the above de&s;cription, perhaps, are the warrants put into the hands of an uninformed con&s;table, who &s;up|po&s;es every thing to be legal which comes from a ju&s;tice of peace, who may po&s;&s;ibly at the &s;ame time be as ignorant as him&s;elf, for the &s;earching after and IMPRESSING OF SEA|MEN; a practice in direct violation of every con&s;titutional princi|ple, and certainly un&s;upported by any po&s;itive law. Let the con&s;table therefor who too officiously engages in a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o de|&s;ervedly unpopular, &s;eriously reflect of the ri&s;k he runs; let him dread the con&s;equences of a &s;pirited re&s;i&s;tance. He murders if he kill; it is ju&s;tifiable homicide, or at mo&s;t man&s;laughter, if he be killed. The law, very properly, encourages and invites all men to repre&s;s an act of illegality and violence, and the rather, as we have ju&s;t &s;een, if it be done under colour of ju&s;tice. See the ca&s;e already cited in Lord Raymonds Reports; and that of Hop|kins Hugget, in Sir John Kelyngs: Ca&s;es of much greater con&s;equence and authority than the flim&s;y rea&s;oning u&s;ed in de|fence of pre&s;s-warrants.

<P>IT was originally intended that the compilers publica|tion on the &s;ubject here treated of &s;hould have compri&s;ed all that, to his knowlege, had been &s;aid, or in his judge|ment, could be &s;aid, upon it. Large collections were made for the purpo&s;e, and the work partly proceeded in; but the bulk of the volume, and the &s;canty &s;ale it was likely to experience, effectually di&s;couraged him from proceeding with that plan, and produced the Introduction and Analy&s;is now pre&s;ented to the public.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TO the conci&s;e view attempted in the following pages of the juri&s;diction of the Court Leet it may not be improper to prefix a few words upon the name, antiquity, nature, and pre&s;ent &s;tate of this ancient and venerable tribunal.</P>
<P N="1">I. The name or &s;tile of this court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAME.</NOTE> as formally entered in its own proceedings, is the "Court Leet and View of Frankpledge." The word <HI>Leet,</HI>&mdash;which, it is very remarkable, is to be found neither in the Saxon law, nor in Glanvil, Bracton, Britton, Fleta, or the Mirror, our mo&s;t ancient law writers, nor in any &s;tatute prior to the 27th year of King Ed. III.<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">C. 28. After which it does not appear again till the 4 E. 4. c. 1. See al&s;o 12 E. 4. c. 9.</NOTE> though it is allowed to occur in the Conquerors charter for the foundation of Battle Abbey, and not unfrequently in Dome&s;day book<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Spelmans Glo&s;&s;ary, <HI>v. Leta.</HI></NOTE>,&mdash;&s;eems to be derived from the Saxon leo&eth; <HI>plebs;</HI> and to mean the <HI>populi curia,</HI> or folk mote, as the Sheriffs tourn or Leet of the county (at lea&s;t) appears to have been once actually called<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Spelman, <HI>v.</HI> Folke&s;mote. Kennets Parochial Antiquities, Glo&s;. <HI>v.</HI> Falmote.</NOTE>; in contra|di&s;tinction, perhaps, to the Halmote or Court Baron,
<PB N="vi" REF="90">which con&s;i&s;ted of the free tenants only, who, being few in number, might conveniently a&s;&s;emble in the Lords Hall; whereas the Leet, which required the attendance of all the refiants, and concerned the admini&s;tration of public ju&s;tice, was, as there will be hereafter occa&s;ion to mention, u&s;ually held in the open air. The "view of Frankpledge," <HI>vi&s;us franciplegii,</HI> means the examination or &s;urvey of the freepledges, of which every man, not particularly privileged, was anciently obliged to have nine, who were bound that he &s;hould be always forth|coming to an&s;wer any complaint. The better to under|&s;tand this we are to be informed that the kingdom being divided into countys or &s;hires, and each county into hundreds, and each hundred into tithings, each tithing containing ten families or hou&s;eholds, the heads of the&s;e families were reciprocally bound and re&s;pon&s;ible for each other; &s;o that, in fact, of every ten hou&s;eholders through|out the kingdom each man had nine pledges or &s;ureties for his good behaviour<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e pledges the elde&s;t, or mo&s;t re&s;pectable, and fir&s;t &s;worn, was called the headborough or chief pledge, and had a degree of authority over the re&s;t, not now exactly a&s;certained. It was, however, in all probabi|lity, much the &s;ame with that of the con&s;table, who was formerly a character of great con&s;equence, and is to this day in many places called the <HI>headborough,</HI> a word, which, according to Sir William Black&s;tone, (too implicitly following Sir Thomas Smith) be&s;peaks its own etymology, and means "the di&s;creete&s;t per&s;on in the <HI>borough.</HI>" Great lawyers, how|ever, are &s;ometimes indifferent etymologi&s;ts: the word, in fact, implys nothing more or le&s;s than the chief pledge, from borg, borh, or borhoe, <HI>fideju&s;&s;or,</HI> a pledge or &s;urety. He was al&s;o called the <HI>bor&s;alder</HI> (borges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alder) (<HI>i. e.</HI> the elde&s;t of the pledges, and the <HI>tithing man.</HI>) Both <HI>tithing man</HI> and <HI>bor&s;holder</HI> are to be found in modern &s;tatutes as &s;ynonimous with <HI>con&s;table</HI> and <HI>headborough.</HI> But at what period the con&s;table became a di&s;tinct officer, and the chief pledges were metamorpho&s;ed into a grand jury, is a point which mu&s;t be left to a more &s;ucce&s;sful enquirer.</NOTE>. This is the famous &s;y&s;tem of King Alfred, &s;o much applauded by both ancient and
<PB N="vii" REF="91">modern writers; which produced &s;uch &s;ingular effects among a barbarous and di&s;orderly people, that a man might have hung his pur&s;e by the &s;ide of a public road, and found it untouched a month after; or might have ridden, with much trea&s;ure, and no other weapon than a white wand, from one end of the kingdom to the other<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">Ingulphus.

Since, however, this &s;o excellent and admirable in&s;titution is, from whatever cau&s;e, &s;unk into total di&s;u&s;e, there not having been any freepledges in the kingdom for two or three centuries, the words "View of Frankpledge" in the &s;tile of the court &s;eem now altogether unnece&s;&s;ary and improper.

Shak&s;peare mentions the Leet, in another play, quoted below, p. 11. He had po&s;&s;ibly &s;erved the office of an <HI>aleta&s;ter,</HI> at Stratford; or might indeed have got his information by attending the court when his father was <HI>Bailiff.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY.</NOTE> II. That the Leet is "the mo&s;t ancient court in the land" (for criminal matters, that is, the Court Baron being of no le&s;s antiquity in civil) has been pronounced by the highe&s;t legal authority<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">7 H, 6. 12, b. 1 Roll. R. 73.</NOTE>. For though we do not meet with the <HI>word</HI> among the Saxons, there can be no doubt of the exi&s;tence of the <HI>thing.</HI> The venerable chief ju&s;tice who lately retired from the elevated &s;ituation
<PB N="viii" REF="92">in which he had &s;o long pre&s;ided found this court "coeval with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Saxons here," and its activity "marked very vi&s;ibly both among&s;t the Saxons and the Danes<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">3 Bur. 1860.</NOTE>." In tho&s;e times whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a vill or territory, with the liberties of <HI>&s;oc, &s;ac,</HI> &amp;c. (a long &s;tring of barbarous words) was the lord of a manor, had a court leet, court baron, and, in a word, every privilege which it &s;eems to have been po&s;&s;ible for the monarch to be&s;tow, or for the &s;ubject to acquire<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Spelman <HI>v. Manerium.</HI> The po&s;ition u&s;ed by Fineux in 12 H. 7. 15. that the Leet is derived out of the Sheriffs Tourn is not intitled to any particular notice, being a mere un&s;upported <HI>dictum;</HI> to which neither Lord Cokes adoption (2 In&s;t. 71.) nor that of Lord Mansfield, (3 Bur. 1860.) can add any weight. Much matter and many authorities mu&s;t be &s;acrificed throughout this little enquiry for the &s;ake of brevity. As to the re&s;t, the word Leet, though generally appropriated to the court of a manor, has in fact nothing e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct from the Tourn, but the being upon a &s;maller &s;cale. (See, however, Britton. c. 29. 44 E. 3. 9. 1 E. 4. c. 2.) Tho&s;e writers therefor who &s;uppo&s;e the Leet of a hundred or manor inferior to or &s;ubject to the controul of the Tourn or Leet of the County are egregiously mi&s;taken: the juri&s;diction of the latter being con|fined to &s;o much of the county or hundred as is not compri&s;ed within the precinct of the manor. See 4 In&s;t. 261: It is indeed repeatedly &s;aid in our old books that things of which the Leet (of a manor, that is) omits to enquire &s;hall be enquired of in the Tourn: which may well be; and the rea&s;on is that the lord has forfeited his leet for the time, <HI>quoad</HI> the parti|cular object: it being very clear that, when the Leet of a manor is by any means lo&s;t the re&s;iants owe &s;uit to the tourn, and that although they &s;hould be within a hundred in the hands of a private per&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>ALL the books, rolls, and other muniments of the Savoy Court, anterior to the year 1683, are &s;up|po&s;ed to have peri&s;hed in private hands. But there is &s;uf|ficient evidence that the court has been regularly held ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of King Henry the Fourth, <HI>anno</HI> 1399; as, without doubt, it was long before that period; the Liberty being one of the olde&s;t in the kingdom, and having been parcel of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Duchy of Lanca&s;ter from the time of its fir&s;t erection, and even the property of he Earls of that title for near a century before.</P>

<P>E. C. 1696. John A&s;hley, for "apearing at this court, and in contemp[t] therof departing without lycence," fined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The difference between a fine and amerciament is, that the former is the &s;ole act of the court; the latter mu&s;t be grounded upon the pre&s;entments of the jury, and mu&s;t likewi&s;e be affeered, <HI>i. e.</HI> a&s;certained or reduced to certainty, by indifferent per&s;ons &s;worn for that purpo&s;e, and who are generally, but not nece&s;&s;arily, taken out of the jury (See E. C. 1754 and 1772, in&s;tances of the affeerers not being jurymen). It &s;eems requi&s;ite however that they &s;hould be ac|quainted with the nature of the offence in re&s;pect whereof the amercia|ment is impo&s;ed. A fine on the contrary needs no affeerment, being impo&s;ed by the &s;teward as judge, for offences committed within his own view, or the defaults of the officers of the court. A fine on an officer is likewi&s;e called an amerciament or amerciament royal, but does not on that account require any affeering. Unle&s;s, therefor, John A&s;hley was in office, this fine was illegal.</P>
<P>Till the year 1787, (M. C.) the amerciaments were always &s;et by the jury in their pre&s;entments, at an expre&s;s &s;um, which was afterward affeered. But this practice, being thought irregular, was then altered, upon due deliberation and good advice; &s;o that then and thencefor|ward the amerciament was and has been &s;et by the court indefinitely, "and therefor he is amerced," an&s;wering to the <HI>Ideo ip&s;e in mi&s;ericordia</HI> of the old precedents; and afterward affeered at a preci&s;e &s;um. It &s;hould be noticed, however, that &s;ome in&s;tances have been &s;ince di&s;covered where an amerciament is &s;et upon the pre&s;entments of the aleconners, &amp;c. in the very language now adopted, "and therefore he is amerced;" which may induce one to believe that it is but a re|&s;toration of the ancient practice.

<P>The MIDDLE-WARD . . . begins at the kennel on the north &s;ide of the Strand, without the footway there, oppo&s;ite to Milford Lane, and from thence extending down by the middle of the &s;aid lane to the River Thames, being bound|ed all the way on the ea&s;t &s;ide by the Royal_Ward before de&s;cribed, and extending from the bottom of Milford Lane

<P>This inqui&s;ition is, in many re&s;pects, an admirable record, and the plan very accurately and neatly delineated. The jurors, however, were undoubtedly misled by the &s;urvey of 44 Eliz. for in fact there is no mention of Ivy Lane in that of 1653. Whether there were any blame in not enquiring more minutely into a matter &s;o important as evey this is which men have to deliver upon oath as a guide to po&s;terity, and upon whom it ought to fall, we cannot well &s;ay. But the rea&s;on and cau&s;e of this &s;erious mi&s;take was in truth as follows: Soon after the 44th Eliz. which was the year 1602, being the la&s;t of her reign, the ancient lane called Ivy Lane or Ivy Bridge Lane, was by virtue of a grant under the Duchy &s;eal and of a writ of <HI>ad quod dumnam,</HI> and an inqui&s;ition thereon, taken away or blocked up by Sir Robert Cecil, afterward Earl of Sali&s;bury, who, in lieu thereof, opened a new lane or pa&s;&s;age from the Strand to the river on the we&s;t &s;ide of his hou&s;e, which retained the old name of Ivy Lane, as a bridge at the bottom of it did that of Ivy Bridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient bridge was of a very different nature. Both Ivy Lane and Strand Lane were originally low &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, &s;omewhat re&s;embling, it is thought, the pre&s;ent arched cart-ways to the Adelphi wharfs; the bridges them&s;elves being in the high &s;treet. <HI>Vide</HI> Stows Survey by Strype, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. ic. c. 7. It is wonderful that the translation of Ivy Lane &s;hould have e&s;caped the re|&s;earches of this indu&s;trious edito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e works was originally publi&s;hed in 1598.</NOTE> This proceeding, which was confirmed by a private act of parliament in the 3d year of K. James I. could not however affect the boundary of the liberty; and as the middle of Cecil Street has, ever &s;ince it was made, been looked upon and perambulated as the we&s;t boundary, it &s;eems highly probable that the middle of this &s;treet is the identical ground which at the time of taking the &s;urvey of the 44th Eliz. was the middle of Ivy Lane.
