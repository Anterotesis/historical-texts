<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE BEE AND THE SPIDER. FROM DODSLEY'S FABLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bee and the Spider once entered into a warm de|bate which was the better artist. The Spider urg|ed her &s;kill in the mathematics, and a&s;&s;erted, that no one was half &s;o well acquainted as her&s;elf with the construc|tion of lines, angles, &s;quares and circles: that the web &s;he daily wove was a &s;pecimen of art inimitable by any other creature in the univer&s;e: and, be&s;ides, that her works were derived from her&s;elf alone, the product of her own bowels; whereas the boasted honey of the Bee was stolen from every herb and flower of the field; nay, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he had obligations even to the meanest weeds. To this the Bee replied, that &s;he was in hopes the art of extracting honey from the meanest weeds would at least have been allowed her as an excellence; and, that, as to her stealing &s;weets from the herbs, and flowers of the field, her &s;kill was therein &s;o con&s;picuous, that no flower ever &s;uffered the least diminution of its fragrance from &s;o delicate an ope|ration. Then, as to the Spider's vaunted knowledge in the construction of lines and angles, &s;he believed &s;he might &s;afely rest the merits of her cau&s;e on the regularity alone of her combs; but &s;ince &s;he could add this, the &s;weet|ne&s;s and excellence of her honey, and the various purpo&s;es to which her wax was employed, &s;he had nothing to fear from the compari&s;on of her &s;kill with that of the weaver of a flim&s;y cobweb; for the value of every art, &s;he ob&s;erv|ed, is chiefly to be estimated by its u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>FROM CATO's LETTERS. ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITHOUT freedom of thought, there can be no &s;uch thing as wi&s;dom; and no &s;uch thing as public liberty, without freedom of &s;peech: which is the right of every man, as far as by it he does not hurt and controul the right of another; and this is the only check which it ought to &s;uffer, the only bounds which it ought to know.</P>
<P>This &s;acred privilege is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to free go|vernment, that the &s;ecurity of property and the freedom of &s;peech always go together; and in tho&s;e wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can &s;carce call any thing el&s;e his own. Whoever would overthow the liberty of the nation, mu&s;t begin by &s;ubduing the liberty of &s;peech; a thing terrible to public traitors.</P>
<P>This &s;ecret was &s;o well known to the court of King Charles the fir&s;t, that his wicked mini&s;try procured a proclamation to forbid the people to talk of parliaments, which tho&s;e traitors had laid a&s;ide. To a&s;&s;ert the undoubted right of the &s;ubject, and defend his maje&s;ty's legal prerogative, was called di&s;affection, and puni&s;hed as &s;edition. Nay, people were forbid to talk of religion in their fa|milies: for the prie&s;ts too had combined to cook up tyranny, and &s;uppre&s;s truth and the law. While the late King James, when Duke of York, went avowedly to ma&s;s, men were fined, impri&s;oned, and undone, for &s;aying he was a papi&s;t: and that King Charles the &s;econd might live more &s;ecurely a pa|pi&s;t, there was an act of parliament made, declar|ing it trea&s;on to &s;ay that he was one.</P>
<P>That men ought to &s;peak well of their governors, is true, while their governors de&s;erve to be well &s;poken of; but to do public mi&s;chief without hear|ing of it, is only the prerogative and felicity of
<PB N="4" REF="5">tyranny; a free people will be &s;hewing they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, by their freedom of &s;peech.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration of government is nothing el&s;e but the attendance of the tru&s;tees of the peo|ple, upon the intere&s;t and affairs of the people. And as it is the part and bu&s;ine&s;s of the people, for who&s;e &s;ake alone all public matters are, or ought to be tran&s;acted, to &s;ee whether they be well or ill tran&s;acted; &s;o it is the intere&s;t, and ought to be the ambition, of all hone&s;t magi&s;trates, to have their deeds openly examined, and publicly &s;canned: only the wicked governors of men dread what is &s;aid of them.</P>
<P>Freedom of &s;peech is the great bulwark of liber|ty; they pro&s;per and die together: and it is the terror of traitors and oppre&s;&s;ors, and a barrier again&s;t them. It produces excellent writers, and encourages men of fine genius. Tacitus tells us, that the Roman commonwealth bred great and nu|merous authors, who wrote with equal boldne&s;s and eloquence: but when it was en&s;laved, tho&s;e great wits were no more. Tyranny had u&s;urped the place of equality, which is the &s;oul of liberty, and de&s;troyed public courage. The minds of men, terrified by unju&s;t power, degenerated into all the vilene&s;s and methods of &s;ervitude: abject, &s;yco|phancy and blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion grew the only means of preferment, and indeed of &s;afety; men dur&s;t not open their mouths but to flatter.</P>
<P>Pliny the younger ob&s;erves, that this dread of tyranny had &s;uch effect, that the &s;enate, the great Roman &s;enate, became at la&s;t &s;tupid and dumb. Hence, &s;ays he, our &s;pirit and genius are &s;tupified, broken and &s;unk for ever. And in one of his epi&s;tles, &s;peaking of the works of his uncle, he makes an apology for eight of them, as not written with the &s;ame vigour which was to be found in the re&s;t; for that the&s;e eight were written in the reign of Nero, when the &s;pirit of writing was cramped with fear.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">I have long thought that the world are very much mi&s;taken in their idea and di&s;tinction of li|bels. It has been hitherto generally under&s;tood that there are no other libels but tho&s;e again&s;t magi&s;|trates, and tho&s;e again&s;t private men: now to me there &s;eems to be a third &s;ort of libels, full as de|&s;tructive as any of the former can po&s;&s;ibly be, I mean libels again&s;t the people. It was otherwi&s;e at Athens and Rome; where, though, particular men, and even great men, were often treated with much freedom and &s;everity, when they de&s;erved it; yet the people, the body of the people, were &s;poken of with the utmo&s;t regard and reverence; the &s;acred privileges of the people, the inviolable maje&s;ty of the people, and the unappealable judg|ment of the people, were phra&s;es common in tho&s;e wi&s;e, great, and free cities. Other modes of &s;peech are &s;ince grown fa&s;hionable, and popular madne&s;s is now almo&s;t proverbial; but this madne&s;s of theirs, whenever it happens, is derived from external cau&s;es. Oppre&s;&s;ion, they &s;ay, will make a wi&s;e man mad; and delu&s;ion has not le&s;s force; but where there are neither oppre&s;&s;ion nor impo&s;ters, the judgment of the people in the bu&s;ine&s;s of pro|perty, the pre&s;ervation of which is the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of government, does rarely err. Perhaps they are de&s;titute of grimace, my&s;tery, re&s;erve, and other accompli&s;hments of courtiers; but as the&s;e are only ma&s;ks to conceal the ab&s;ence of hone&s;ty and &s;en&s;e, the people, who po&s;&s;e&s;s as they do th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ub&s;tance, have rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch in&s;ipid and contemptible &s;hadows.</P>
<P>Machiavel, in the chapter where he proves that a multitude is wi&s;er and more con&s;tant than a prince, complains, that the credid which the peo|ple &s;hould be in declines daily: For, &s;ays he, every man has liberty to &s;peak what he plea&s;es again&s;t them, but again&s;t a prince no man can talk without a thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions and dangers. I have in|deed
<PB N="6" REF="7">often wondered, that the inveighing again&s;t the intere&s;t of the people, and calling their liber|ties in que&s;tion, as has been, and is commonly done among&s;t us by old knaves and young fools, has never been made an expre&s;s crime.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I know not what trea&s;on is, if &s;ap|ping and betraying the liberties of a people be not trea&s;on, in the eternal and original nature of things. Let it be remembered for who&s;e &s;ake government is, or could be appointed; then let it be con&s;ider|ed who are more to be regarded, the governors, or the governed; they indeed owe one another mu|tual duties; but if there be any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions com|mitted, the &s;ide that is mo&s;t obliged, ought doubt|le&s;s to bear the mo&s;t: and yet it is &s;o far otherwi&s;e, that almo&s;t all over the earth, the people, for one injury that they do their governors, receive ten thou&s;and from them: any, in &s;ome countries, it is made death and damnation, not to bear all the oppre&s;&s;ions and cruelties which men, made wanton by power, inflict upon tho&s;e that gave it them.</P>
<P>The truth is; If the people are &s;uffered to keep their own, it is the mo&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they de&s;ire: but even that is a happine&s;s which in few places falls to their lot; they are frequently robbed by tho&s;e whom they pay to protect them. I know that it is a ge|neral charge again&s;t the people. that they are tur|bulent, re&s;tle&s;s, fickle, and unruly; than which there can be nothing more untrue, for they are only &s;o, where they are made &s;o. As to their being fickle, it is &s;o fal&s;e, that, on the contrary, they have almo&s;t ever a &s;trong bent to received cu&s;toms, and as &s;trong a partiality to names and families that they have been u&s;ed to: and as to their being turbulent, it is as fal&s;e; &s;ince there is &s;carce and ex|ample in an hundred years of any people's giving governors any unea&s;ine&s;s, till their governors had made them unea&s;y: nay, for the mo&s;t part, they bear many evils without returning one, and &s;eldom throw off their burdens &s;o long as they can &s;tand under them.</P>

<HEAD>From Swift's Sermon on Fal&s;e Witne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> way by which a man becometh a fal&s;e witne&s;s, is, when he mixeth fal&s;ehood and truth together, or concealeth &s;ome circum&s;tances, which, if they were told, would de&s;troy the fal&s;e|hoods he uttered. So the two fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es who accu&s;ed our Saviour before the chief prie&s;ts, by a very little perverting his words, would have made him guilty of a capital crime; for &s;o it was among the Jews to prophecy any evil again&s;t the temple. <HI>This fellow &s;aid, I am able to de&s;troy the Temple of God, and to rebuild it again in three days</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxvi. 6.</NOTE>; whereas the words, as our Saviour &s;poke them, were to ano|ther end, and differently expre&s;&s;ed; for when the Jews a&s;ked him to &s;hew them a &s;ign, he &s;aid, <HI>De|&s;troy this Temple, and in three days I will rai&s;e it up.</HI> In &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, an innocent man is half confounded, and looketh as if he were guilty, &s;ince he neither can deny his words, nor perhaps readily &s;trip them from the malicious additions of a fal&s;e witne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> A man is a fal&s;e witne&s;s, when, in accu&s;ing his neighbour, he endeavoureth to aggra|vate, by his ge&s;tures and tone of his voice, or when he chargeth a man with words, which were only repeated o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quoted from &s;omebody el&s;e. As if any one &s;hould tell me that he heard another &s;peak certain dangerous and &s;editious &s;peeches, and I &s;hould immediately accu&s;e him for &s;peeking them him&s;elf; and &s;o drop the only circum&s;tance that made him innocent. This was the ca&s;e of St. Stephen. The fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;aid, <HI>This man cea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th not to &s;peak bla&s;phemous words again&s;t this holy place and the law</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts vi, 13</NOTE>. Whereas St. Stephen &s;aid no &s;uch words, but only repeated &s;ome pro|phe&s;ies of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> or <HI>Malachi.</HI> which threatened <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with de&s;truction if it did not repent:
<PB N="8" REF="9">However, by the fury of the people, this innocent holy per&s;on was &s;toned to death, for words he ne|ver &s;poke.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The blacke&s;t kind of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, are tho&s;e who do the offices of the devil, by tempting their brethren in order to betray them, I cannot call to mind any in&s;tances of this kind mentioned in holy &s;cripture; but I am afraid this vile practice hath been too much followed in the world. When a man's temper hath been &s;o &s;oured by his misfortunes and hard u&s;age, that perhaps he hath rea&s;on enough to complain; then one of the&s;e &s;educers, under the pretence of friend&s;hip, will &s;eem to lament his ca&s;e, urge the hard&s;hips he hath &s;uffered, and endeavour to rai&s;e his pa&s;&s;ions, until he hath &s;aid &s;omething that a malicious in|former can pervert or aggravate again&s;t him in a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Whoever beareth witne&s;s again&s;t his neighbour, out of a principle of malice and revenge, from any old grudge, or hatred to his per&s;on; &s;uch a man is a fal&s;e witne&s;s in the &s;ight of God, al|though what he &s;ays be true; becau&s;e the motive or cau&s;e is evil, not to &s;erve his prince or country, but to gratify his own re&s;entments. And there|fore, although a man thus accu&s;ed, may be very ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by the law, yet this doth by no means acquit the accu&s;er, who, in&s;tead of regard|ing the public &s;ervice, intended only to glut his private rage and &s;pite.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> I number among fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, all tho&s;e who make a trade of being informers, in hope of favour and reward; and to this end employ their time, either by li&s;tening in public places, to catch up an accidental word, or in corrupting men's &s;ervants to di&s;cover any unwary expre&s;&s;ion of their ma&s;ter; or thru&s;ting them&s;elves into com|pany, and then u&s;ing the mo&s;t indecent &s;currilous language; fa&s;tening a thou&s;and fal&s;ehoods and
<PB N="9" REF="10">&s;candals upon a whole party, on purpo&s;e to provoke &s;uch an an&s;wer as they may turn to an accu&s;ation: And truly this ungodly race is &s;aid to be grown &s;o numerous, that men of different parties can hardly conver&s;e together with any &s;ecurity. Even the pulpit hath not been free from the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions of the&s;e informers; of whom the clergy have not wanted occa&s;ions to complain with holy <HI>David: They daily mi&s;take my words, all they imagine is to do me evil.</HI> Nor is it any wonder at all, that this trade of informing &s;hould be now in a flouri&s;hing condition. &s;ince our ca&s;e is manife&s;tly thus; we are divided into two parties, with very little cha|rity or temper toward each other: the prevailing &s;ide may talk of pa&s;t things as they plea&s;e with &s;ecurity, and generally do it in the mo&s;t provok|ing words they can invent: while tho&s;e who are down, are &s;ometimes tempted to &s;peak in favour of a lo&s;t cau&s;e, and therefore without great cau|tion, mu&s;t needs be often caught tripping, and thereby furni&s;h plenty of materials for witne&s;&s;es and informers.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Tho&s;e may well be reckoned among fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es again&s;t their neighbour, who bring him into trouble and puni&s;hment by &s;uch accu&s;ations as are of no con&s;equence at all to the public, nor can be of any other u&s;e but to create vexation. Such witne&s;&s;es are tho&s;e who cannot hear an idle intemperate expre&s;&s;ion, but they mu&s;t immediate|ly run to the magi&s;trate to inform; or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night, when they were not able to &s;peak or apprehend three words of common &s;en&s;e, will pretend to remember every thing in the morning, and think them&s;elves very properly qualified to be accu&s;ers of their brethren.</P>
<P>It might perhaps be thought proper to have added &s;omething by way of advice to tho&s;e who are unhappily engaged in this abominabe trade and
<PB N="10" REF="11">&s;in of bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s; but I am far from be|lieving or &s;uppo&s;ing any of that de&s;tructive tribe are now my hearers. I look upon them as a &s;ort of people that &s;eldom frequent the&s;e holy places, where they can hardly pick up any materials to &s;erve their turn, unle&s;s they think it worth their while to mi&s;repre&s;ent or pervert the words of the preacher: and whoever is that way di&s;po&s;ed, I doubt cannot be in a very good condition to edify and reform him&s;elf by what he heareth. God in his mercy pre&s;erve us all from the guilt of this grievous &s;in, forbidden in my text<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod, xx. 16.

<HEAD>ON THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS CAPAT. From a Pamphlet entitled. <HI>"Peace and Union."</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By William Friend,</HI> M. A.</BYLINE>
<P>LOUIS CAPET has afforded an excellent to|pick for parliamentary declamation. Let us &s;trip the &s;ubject of figures of rhetorick, and no Engli&s;hman need be alarmed at the execution of and individual at Paris. Louis Capet was once King of France, and entitled to the honours of that exalted &s;tation. The &s;upreme power of the nation declared that France &s;hould be a Republic; from that moment Louis Capet lo&s;t his titles. He was accu&s;ed of enormous crimes, confined as a &s;tate pri&s;oner, tried by the National Convention, found guilty, condemned, and executed. What
<PB N="12" REF="13">is there wonderful in all this? Our revolution, the boa&s;t of the pre&s;ent days, pur&s;ued the &s;ame con|duct as nearly as po&s;&s;ible. Our Convention de|clared, that James the Second &s;hould be no longer king; it did not chu&s;e to aboli&s;h king&s;hip, but dignified William the Third with regal honours. James was &s;tripped of his titles, and became plain James Stuart, and the rebublican William became a &s;overeign. James was not tried, condemned, and executed, becau&s;e he &s;aved his life by flight: but the laws again&s;t him&s;elf and his &s;on, and the proceedings in the years fifteen and forty-five, mu&s;t convince the mo&s;t &s;uperficial rea&s;oner, that the maxims of the Engli&s;h and French nations, with re&s;pect to the dethroning of kings, are ex|actly the &s;ame. But &s;ome one will &s;ay, Louis Capet was unju&s;tly condemned. Ninety-nine out of a hundred, who make this objection, have not given them&s;elves the trouble of examining the records of the trial; and why &s;hould I give greater credit to the remaining objector than to the ver|dict of the court? If Louis Capet did when king encourage the inva&s;ion of his country, however, we may be inclined to pity the unfortunate man, for the error of his conduct, we have no right to proclaim him innocent in pomt of law. It is, in &s;hort, no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; and if all the crowned heads in the continent are taken off, it is no bu&s;i|ne&s;s of ours. We &s;hould be unworthy of the con&s;titution &s;ettled at the revolution, and enemies to the Brun&s;wick families now &s;eated on our throne, if we denied to any nation the right of &s;ettling, as it plea&s;ed, its own internal government. The&s;e &s;entiments do not prevent us from com|mi&s;erating the &s;ituation of the French refugees.

<HEAD>ON POLITICAL SUPERSTITION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[From Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders.]</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another con&s;ideration from which we may argue the total extinction of wars, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of e&s;tabli&s;hing governments on the repre&s;entative wi&s;dom of the people. We are all &s;en&s;ible that &s;uper&s;tition is a blemi&s;h of hu|man nature, by no means confined to &s;ubjects con|nected with religion. Political &s;uper&s;tition is al|mo&s;t as &s;trong as religious; and it is quite as uni|ver&s;ally u&s;ed as an in&s;trument of tyranny. To enumerate the variety of ways in which this in|&s;trument operates on the mind, would be more difficult than to form a general idea of the re&s;ult of its operations. In monarchies it induces men to &s;pill their blood for a particular family, or for a particu|lar branch of that family who happens to have been born fir&s;t, or la&s;t; or to have been taught to repeat a certain creed, in preference to other creeds. But the effect which I am going chiefly to notice, is that which re&s;pects the territorial boundaries of a government. For a man in Portugal of Spain to prefer belonging to one of tho&s;e nations rather than the other, is as much &s;uper&s;tition, as to prefer the hou&s;e of Braganza to that of Bourbon, or Mary the &s;econd of England to her brother. All the&s;e &s;ubjects of preference &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing as the turban and the hat, the cro&s;s and the cre&s;cent, or, the lily and the ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The boundaries of nations have been fixed for the accommodation of the <HI>government,</HI> without the lea&s;t regard to the convenience of the people. Kings
<PB N="14" REF="15">and mini&s;ters, who make a profitable trade of go|verning, are intere&s;ted in extending the limits of their dominion as far as po&s;&s;ible. They have a property in the people, and in the territory that they cover. The country and its inhabitants are to them a farm &s;tocked with &s;heep. When they call up the&s;e &s;heep to be &s;heared, they teach them to know their names, to follow their ma&s;ter, and avoid a &s;tranger.

<HEAD>The Effects of War on the Poor.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(From Mr. Frend's Pamphlet entitled, "Peace and Union.")</HEAD>
<P>THREE days after the debate on the king's me&s;|&s;age, I was walking from my friend's hou&s;e to the neighbouring town, to in&s;pect the printing of the&s;e few &s;heets, and in my way joined company with two men of the village, who, being employed by the Wool-&s;taplers to let out &s;pinning to the poor, had lately received orders to lower the value of labour. We were talking on this &s;ubject, when the exclamations of a groupe of poor women going to market, overhearing our conver&s;ation, made an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind which all the eloquence of the Hou&s;es of Lords and Commons cannot efface.&mdash; We are to be &s;conced three pence in the &s;hilling; let others work for me, I'll not. We are to be &s;conced a fourth part of our labour. What is all this for? I did not dare to tell them what it was for, nor to add in&s;ult to mi&s;ery. What is the be|heading of a monarch to them? What is the navi|gation of the Scheldt to them? What is the free|dom of a great nation to them, but rea&s;on for joy? Yet the debating only on the&s;e &s;ubjects has reached their cottages. They are already &s;conced three-pence in the &s;hilling. What mu&s;t be their fate, when we &s;uffer under the mo&s;t odious &s;courge of the human race, and the accumulation of taxes takes away half of that daily bread which is &s;carce &s;uffi|cient at pre&s;ent for their &s;upport?</P>
<P>Oh! that I had the warning voice of an ancient Prophet, that I might penetrate into the inmo&s;t re|ce&s;&s;es
<PB N="16" REF="17">of palaces, and appal the harranguers of &s;e|nates. I would u&s;e no other language than that of the poor market-women. I would cry aloud in the ears of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate: We are &s;conced three-pence in the &s;hilling, the fourth part of our labour, for what? I would addre&s;s my&s;elf to the deliberat|ing bodies: We are &s;conced three pence in the &s;hilling, the fourth part of our labour, for what? Is there a man that could &s;tand out again&s;t this elo|quence? Yes. Thou&s;ands. Three-pence in the &s;hilling for &s;pinning conveys no ideas to them. They know not what a cottage is, they know not how the poor live, how they make up their &s;canty meal. Perhaps there may be &s;ome one in our Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e feelings are in union with mine; communicate them to your colleagues, im|pre&s;s them with the horror attendant on their deli|berations; tell them what the deduction of three-pence in the &s;hilling occa&s;ions among the myriads of England, And &s;hould any grave courtier, pity|ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, be anxious to relieve them, &s;ay to him, There is an ea&s;y method: let the fir&s;t magi&s;trate, the peers, the repre&s;entatives of the people, the rich men of the nation, all who are for war, be &s;conced one fourth part of their an|nual income to defray the expence of it. Let them be the fir&s;t &s;ufferers, let the burden fall on them not on the poor. Alas! my poor countrymen how many years calamity awaits you, before a &s;ingle di&s;h or a gla&s;s of wine will be withdrawn from the ta|bles of opulence!</P>
<P>At this moment, perhaps the decree is gone forth for war.

<P>&mdash;THERE is a vice in the civil polity of al|mo&s;t every &s;tate in Europe, that is ne|ce&s;&s;arily the parent of revolution, creating all the mi&s;ery-and crimes that afflict the great ma&s;s of mankind, and driving them to in&s;urrection as a la&s;t re&s;ource. The government draws the money out of the pockets of the poor, to give it, under the denomination of places and pen&s;ions, to the rich. The rich avail them&s;elves of this to accumulate property; till at la&s;t their colo&s;&s;al &s;tride reaches from province to province, and the whole land, that &s;eems the birth right of the community, is mono|polized by a few individuals. The re&s;t of the na|tion is then left at their mercy; and both the know|ledge of mankind and experience prove, that the re&s;t of the nation have nothing to hope for at their hands, but what they can obtain by making <HI>their own</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;upport, the luxury, and the plea&s;ure of their lordly ma&s;ters, who always take care that the &s;alary of their day's labour &s;hall be preci&s;ely enough to &s;upply re&s;t and &s;trength for the labours of the next. Thus are they reduced to more working automata, with neither the means nor lei&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to acquire in&s;truction, or to &s;often their manners to &s;ocial intercour&s;e and enjoyments; and thus is the human &s;pecies degraded, The evil, by a nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;&s;ion, grows greater; for the number of rich growing &s;maller, proportion as the mo&s;t wealthy &s;wallow up the re&s;t, the demand for labour becomes le&s;s, while the competition for employment increa&s;es. A harder bargain is con&s;e|quently made, till at la&s;t the point of &s;ufferance is pa&s;t, the boa&s;t of burden kicks the load off his back, turns to a bea&s;t of prey, tears every thing he meets with to pieces, and takes a blind and furious ven|geance
<PB N="19" REF="20">for all the oppre&s;&s;ion he has &s;uffered. Of this continued the Frenchinan with a &s;igh, my country is a lamentable example.</P>
<P>After this monopoly of landed property, the grand &s;ource of human vices and misfortunes. the greate&s;t &s;courge that can afflict a people is an exten|&s;iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> foreign commerce. If by the nation be under|&s;tood a few merchants. &s;hip owners. &s;hip's hu&s;bands, brokers, bankers manufact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and fi&s;cal officers, the nation is indeed pro&s;perous when trade is in a thriving &s;tate. But if by the nation we may be al|lowed to under&s;tand all tho&s;e not compri&s;ed in the above de&s;cription, that is to &s;ay at lea&s;t nine-tenths of the community, the ca&s;e is the rever&s;e. It is &s;elf evident, that foreign commerce can only con|&s;i&s;t of exportation and importation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s indeed where a people &s;hould be merely brokers and car|riers for others. It is equally evident, that a coun|try can only export what is produced by the labour of its inhabitants on the &s;oil. or by their drudgery in manufactures If then no part of what is im|ported comes to the &s;hare of tho&s;e who drudge and toil. can it be denied that they give up ea&s;e, plenty and lei&s;ure, for nothing? that the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the enjoyments, and repo&s;e of the many, are &s;acrificed to feed the luxury of the few? What a noble export trade does Ireland carry on in beef, pork, butter, and flour! Well, what does the na|tion at large. that live in that fertile country get in return? The advantage of never la&s;ting meat, bread, or butter: of feed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng on potatoes and butter-milk, and &s;leeping among the litter of their pigs; all which their <HI>noble landlords</HI> while drinking French wines, and wearing French &s;ilks, a&s;&s;ure us is <HI>va&s;tly</HI> conducive to their health! Oh! but in &s;ome other countries tho&s;e who furni&s;h all the exports, obtain a &s;mall portion of the returns. Yes; from America a noxious and intoxicating weed, an enervating drink from A&s;ia, and from the other parts of Eu|rope liquid poi&s;ons, that do indeed for a moment
<PB N="20" REF="21">make them forget the &s;acrifice they co&s;t.</P>
<P>This evil is the offspring of the former; for if property were divided with any tolerable equality, a man would begin by providing amply for his &s;up|port, comfort, and enjoyment; and would only &s;uffer the &s;urplus to be exchanged for foreign &s;u|perfluities; nor would he for &s;uperfluities con|demn him&s;elf to ince&s;&s;ant labour. I have made an exact calculation, continued he; and I find that four hours of work in a day, in our temperate cli|mates, would &s;uffice for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a man and his family. Tho&s;e that remain would afford him lei&s;ure for in&s;truction and reflection; and it would then become impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch men to be impo&s;ed upon by the cant of a few intere&s;ted indi|viduals, who a&s;&s;ure them that the nation has reach|ed the highe&s;t pitch of pro&s;perity, becau&s;e they them&s;elves have obtained every gratification o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not and luxury that they can devi&s;e. But to keep men ignorant, you mu&s;t make them work, and to make them work you mu&s;t keep them ignorant. This is the eternal circle in which rolls the torrent of abu&s;e.

<P>The diligence with which they were practi&s;ing the military exerci&s;e in many places, and the hear|tine&s;s in the cau&s;e that they expre&s;&s;ed in all would have &s;ufficed to convince us, that the idea many people in England affect to entertain of a &s;mall faction domineering it over the whole nation, was totally de&s;titute of foundation, had any proof been wanting to overthrow an opinion &s;o indefen&s;ible. How is it po&s;&s;ible for a &s;mall part to oppre&s;s the whole, when all are armed? Yes: but the party aver&s;e to the revolutioni&s;ts, though the mo&s;t nume|rous, are afraid to &s;hew them&s;elves.&mdash;Why, then what a wretched opinion mu&s;t they have of their
<PB N="22" REF="23">cau&s;e, or what &s;orry da&s;tards mu&s;t they be? How|ever, to "make a&s;&s;urance doubly &s;ure," I conver&s;ed with numbers of people, of all ranks, on my way and found them, with very few exceptions, agreed upon the great principle of liberty. They fre|quently lamented that many unwi&s;e &s;teps had been taken by their repre&s;entatives, and reprobated the infamous crimes of particular factions; but they con&s;idered them, at the &s;ame time, as partial and accidental abu&s;es of a &s;y&s;tem generally and e&s;&s;enti|ally good. Here and there I met with a man, who openly regretted the old government: nor was it a little remarkable, that the greate&s;t ari&s;tocrats I heard &s;peak of politics, were employed by the new go|vernment in the civil and military line. Let it however be remembered, that the Department of the north is one of tho&s;e the mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected of ari|&s;tocracy,</P>
<P>On December 6th we &s;et off for Bru&s;&s;els.

We found the roads entirely covered with convoys going to the army, with detachments of troops, and with &s;traggling &s;oldiers trudging on to join their re&s;pective regiments.</P>
<P>A thaw had lately taken place, the carriages de|prived them of the benefit of the pavement, and they were obliged to wade through mud half way up their legs. Yet &s;till their native gaiety &s;upport|ed them, and on they went, &s;inging <HI>ca ira,</HI> and other patriotic tunes.

As he did not call upon pe&s;tilence and the devil to run away with them, and the road into the bargain, I was &s;ure he could not be a French|man. although he had the national uniform on his back. We a&s;ked him if he al&s;o would get up be|hind, and he joyfully accepted our offer. But as the weather was cold, and he &s;eemed weakly, we &s;oon after found means to make room for him in our carriage. I then a&s;ked him if he had been wounded.&mdash;<HI>Dieu merci!</HI> he had only been cut down at the battle of Jemappe, and then wounded in the foot, while lying on the ground, which was the rea&s;on of his walking &s;o lame. I told him he was too young to run &s;uch hazards, and bear the fatigues of a military life. Too young! &s;aid he, with a proud &s;mile, that ill concealed a little indignation; too young! why I am now nineteen, and near three years ago was &s;hot through the body in the Belgic war. He added that at the beginning of the pre&s;ent campaign he had been ill of a fever; that he had been &s;ent to the ho&s;pital at Maubeuge; that in the time of his convale&s;cence, he had walked out with &s;ome of his comrades; that they had fallen in with a party of French, who were engaged with the ene|my at Gri&s;oelle; that he had taken up a dead man's mu&s;ket to have his &s;hot, <HI>tout comme un autre;</HI> and that a ball from the rifle gun of a Tyrolian cha&s;&s;eur, had hit him in the neck.</P>
<P>When I enquired into the motives of his taking up arms, he &s;aid he had been on the &s;ide of the pa|triots before, and had heard that they were up again, and &s;o he had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft his home at Namur, where he had a father, a mother, and a little &s;i&s;ter <HI>a&s;&s;ez aim|able,</HI> and he would leave them again, as &s;oon as it &s;hould plea&s;e God and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin to cure the lamene&s;s of his foot; for a patriot &s;hould always fight for his country, and &s;hould not mind a wound or two, or a little pain, in a good cau&s;e.

<PB N="24" REF="25">going to Bru&s;&s;els, &s;aid he, to &s;ee &s;ome relations I have there.&mdash;Go where thou wilt, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, thou art a brave youth, and not only a patriot but a philo&s;opher, although <HI>I</HI> verily believe thou do&s;t not know the meaning of the word.</P>
<P>Gaiety was ever the Frenchman's birth-right, but never was it &s;o &s;trongly exhibited as &s;ince they have been animated by the &s;pirit of Patrioti&s;m. This cheerfulne&s;s is always accompanied by another cha|racteri&s;tic of the nation; an uncommon degree of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;regard of danger. In the plains of Champaigne, the two armies were often in &s;ight and almo&s;t within &s;hot of each other: At &s;uch times, there &s;tood the Pru&s;&s;ians menacing a charge, in re|gular array, with &s;upported arms, and motionle&s;s as &s;tatues; and here were the French, dancing in rings around their fires, and broiling their meat on the points of their bayonets.</P>
<P>On a march, woe to the game that gets up be|fore them; a hundred &s;oldiers are &s;ure to &s;end after it the contents of their mu&s;kets, not without dan|ger of &s;hooting their comrades, Even the pre&s;ence of the enemy is in&s;ufficient to correct this deviation from di&s;cipline. It once happened, as a battalion of volunteers was advancing to the attack, in the momentary expectation of receiving and returning the enemy's fire, that they trod up a &s;olitary hare. As &s;he run along the line, &s;he was &s;aluted with an univer&s;al &s;hout, and with a &s;hot or two at lea&s;t from every company &s;he pa&s;&s;ed. The fugitive however e&s;caped it being no ea&s;y matter to kill &s;o &s;mall an animal with a &s;ingle ball.</P>
<P>The old animo&s;ity, and fal&s;e point of honour, that u&s;ed to &s;et regiment again&s;t regiment, and man again&s;t man, and that were &s;uppo&s;ed every year to co&s;t the &s;tate the lives of five hundred &s;oldiers, are &s;o much forgot, that a duel is now a thing of very unfrequent occurrence. It was predicted, that endle&s;s di&s;&s;en&s;ions and jealou&s;ies
<PB N="25" REF="26">would embroil the regular troops with the national guards, but the&s;e fears were &s;o ill founded, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive an army living in more univer|&s;al harmony than that of Dumourier. At public and private tables, nothing is more common than to &s;ee the &s;houlder-knot of a grenadier touching the epaulet of a Colonel; nor does this vicinage &s;eem to &s;urpri&s;e either party. The one &s;hews no haughtine&s;s, the other no &s;ervility, and both interchange upon equal terms the &s;alutation of <HI>Citizen</HI> or Comrade. Though a &s;tranger may be &s;tartled at it at fir&s;t, his wonder di|mini&s;hes when he finds that not a few of the common national volunteers are men of property, &s;ome of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ten, twenty, and thirty thou&s;and livres a year. Many of tho&s;e I &s;poke with &s;upported well the national character of politene&s;s, but they had di&s;carded the frivolous flippancy that was but too frequently its companion. They a&s;&s;umed no credit for their cou|rage, &s;poke of their giving up ea&s;e and comfort to encounter the danger and hard&s;hips of a military life, as only di&s;charging a debt they owed to their coun|try; lamented its being de&s;olated by war and faction; and vowed to &s;ee their enemies humbled, or to &s;leep in the du&s;t. I li&s;tened to them with admiration, and, God and Mr. Burke forgive me, I thought I &s;hould have di&s;graced them by a compari&s;on with the de|funct chivalry of France.</P>
<P>Many of the officers, many even of the &s;uperior ranks, have been rai&s;ed from that of a private &s;oldier. In a ball or drawing-room, they would, no doubt, make an aukward figure; but &s;urely, after a long ap|prentice&s;hip to war, they are as fit to lead a company or a battalion into the fire, as a giddy and beardle&s;s boy, ju&s;t broke loo&s;e from the military &s;chool.</P>
<P>Republican &s;everity is by degrees removing that foppi&s;hne&s;s in dre&s;s and manners that &s;prung from the example of a frivolous court. The &s;mall &s;word, that formerly dangled at the &s;ide of the French of|ficers and &s;oldiers, has re&s;igned its place to a weighty &s;abre. The three-cornered hat, that &s;heltered them neither from rain, &s;un, nor blows, is very generally
<PB N="26" REF="27">changed into a helmet. Their hair, far the mo&s;t part cut &s;hort, is in the &s;tate nature gave it; and many of their whi&s;kers grow unchecked by the razor. The whole of their dre&s;s, in &s;hort, be&s;peaks more attention to utility than &s;how. Some of their new corps mu&s;t however be excepted, particularly the legion of the celebrated St. George. This is a body of &s;even hun|dred men, compo&s;ed of Creoles, Negroes, and Mu|lattoes, and is dre&s;&s;ed and accoutred in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant manner.</P>
<P>I dined one day in company with a black captain of hor&s;e, and judged this new Othello to be worthy of his occupation. His ea&s;y and polite manners de|&s;erved, and met with the re&s;pect and attention of a great number of officers that were pre&s;ent. As for me, it did me good to &s;ee the general fraternity of mankind &s;o nobly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and convinced me, that all the worthle&s;s parts of the human race are only &s;o, becau&s;e deba&s;ed by their political in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Till I came to Liege, I never could give entire be|lief to the wonderful effects &s;aid to have been pro|duced by the mu&s;ic of the ancients. How is it po&s;&s;i|ble, I u&s;ed to &s;ay, that among the multitude of our in&s;truments, and the endle&s;s variety of our compo|&s;itions, one of tho&s;e moving &s;ounds, or powerful pa&s;|&s;ages, &s;hould never yet have been hit upon? But when I came to Liege, the &s;truggle between my faith and my rea&s;on was at an end. I thought I di&s;covered, that tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic emotions were not excited in the Greeks by the mechanical operation of "a con|cord of &s;weet &s;ounds," but by the &s;ubject of their lays, the circum&s;tances they &s;tood in, and the di&s;po|&s;ition of their minds. In their old popular govern|ments, glory and duty went hand in hand, and the per&s;ecution of their liberty, called forth the fanati|ci&s;m of freedom. Such is the &s;ituation of the French, and &s;uch are their feelings, as I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving at the dinner I have ju&s;t mentioned. While we were at table, &s;ome itinerant mu&s;icians were ad|mitted. I need not &s;ay that their mu&s;ic, vocal and in&s;trumental, was far from being of an excellent kind.
<PB N="27" REF="28">It was, neverthele&s;s, a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee the effect the Mar&s;eilles Hymn produced upon the company. When they came to the pa&s;&s;age <HI>aux armes, Citoyens!</HI> all the French officers joined them in concert, mo&s;t untune|able indeed, but with very forcible expre&s;&s;ion. Some of them &s;tood up erect in military attitude, gra&s;ping their &s;words; and I &s;aw tears trickle down faces as hard as iron. In my early youth I had felt much of the martial <HI>mania</HI> my&s;elf; but my long vacancy from warlike occupation, &s;ince the la&s;t peace, had given time to rea&s;on to take the place of &s;entiment; and cold calculations of &s;afety and repo&s;e had damped if not extingui&s;hed all military ardour. The contagion, however, reached me; I repeated <HI>aux armes</HI> with the re&s;t, and felt that I was again become a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>This valour at table is well maintained in the field. If I had only the bare word of the French for it, I &s;hould not fail to make a large abatement for this &s;elf-prai&s;e. Credit, however, cannot be refu&s;ed to the univer&s;al te&s;timony of the natives of the country, who &s;peak with artle&s;s wonder of what they call the <HI>rage</HI> of the new republicans. This bravery is the more meritorious, as a large proportion of their &s;ol|diers are boys. But they are boys, according to the words of our favourite dramati&s;t, "with ladies' faces and fierce dragon's &s;pleen."</P>
<P>During the whole of the journey we remarked, that the apprehen&s;ion of a war with England was peculiarly painful to the French. Though flu&s;hed with their late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and "confident again&s;t a world in arms," it was evident there was nothing they dreaded more than &s;uch an event; not merely on account of the mi&s;chief that might en&s;ue, but be|cau&s;e it would force them to regard as enemies the only nation in Europe they con&s;idered as their friends.</P>
<P>All along the road, they anxiou&s;ly a&s;ked us what we thought would be the con&s;equence of the arma|ment in England? We frankly told them, we pre|&s;umed it would be war, and generally ob&s;erved a mo|ment
<PB N="28" REF="29">of &s;ilence and dejection follow the delivery of our opinion. But &s;oon, bri&s;tling up at the a&s;pect of new dangers, &s;everal of them &s;aid&mdash;"Well! if all the world be determined to fight with us, we will fight with all the world. We can be killed but once.</P>
<P>The imminence of ho&s;tilities, however, dimini&s;hed in no degree the re&s;pect they &s;hewed us as Engli&s;h|men; and not only we did not meet with any thing like an in&s;ult in the whole of our tour; but, on the contrary, we experienced every where particular kind|ne&s;s and attention. They &s;eemed eagerly to court our good opinion; and frequently begged us not to a&s;cribe to a whole nation the faults of individuals, and not to charge their government with di&s;orders its pre&s;ent &s;tate of vacillation rendered it incompe|tent to repre&s;s. If there was any di&s;puting &s;uch high authorities as Mr. Burke, and the collective wi&s;dom of the kings of the continent, I confe&s;s I &s;hould never have &s;u&s;pected, that I was travelling among a nation of &s;avages, madmen, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. I &s;hould rather have wi&s;hed with Shake&s;peare,
<Q><LG>
<L>&mdash;that the&s;e contending kingdoms,</L>
<L>England and France, who&s;e very &s;hores look pale</L>
<L>With envy of each other's happine&s;s,</L>
<L>May cea&s;e their hatred&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;that never war advance</L>
<L>Her bleeding &s;word 'twixt England and fair France&mdash;</L>
<L>That Engli&s;h may as French, French Engli&s;hmen,</L>
<L>Receive each other.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>They looked upon Louis XVI. as a tyrant and a traitor, who had brought a di&s;a&s;trous war upon their country. Though a king, they con&s;idered him as no more than another man. And let us Britons, <HI>penitus ab orbe divi&s;i,</HI> who have a &s;pecial privilege for judging better of what pa&s;&s;es all over the world, than all the world, pity this lamentable mi&s;take. Let us be the more indulgent, as the &s;uperior beings expre&s;&s;ed no particular concern. The Heavens did not &s;hed a tear; no earthly convul&s;ion rent the veil
<PB N="29" REF="30">of the Temple, nor did the thunder, rolling on the left of the guilty city, reprobate the atrocity of the action.</P>
<P>Nay, in proportion as our feelings are &s;en&s;ibly affected at the death of a king we have &s;o few of us &s;een, let us make &s;ome allowance for the feelings of others. The minds of the Pari&s;ians were peculiarly irritated. Thou&s;ands of them had lo&s;t their deare&s;t friends, and their neare&s;t relatives, in the bloody &s;eenes of which the decea&s;ed monarch had been the wilful, or the occa&s;ional cau&s;e; and they all &s;aw their country inve&s;ted by cruel and innumerable foes, who were come with the declared intention of rein&s;tating him in his former de&s;poti&s;m, and who a&s;&s;erted that he was the in&s;idious accomplice of their ho&s;tile attack.</P>
<P>The &s;ame deeds done in different circum&s;tances may &s;tand as wide a&s;under as the poles. The killing of a man from whom we have received no offence, or upon &s;trong provocation, con&s;titutes in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, a horrible crime; in the &s;econd, a fault that may admit of excu&s;e. Con&s;idered in this point of view, even the &s;anguinary &s;cenes of the beginning of September may allow &s;ome little extenuation. Let no man imagine, that I mean in any degree to ju&s;tify what I have never yet &s;uffered with patience a French|man to defend. My blood has ever been chilled by the horrid recital; nor have I a dearer wi&s;h, than to &s;ee the in&s;tigators and preformers of the&s;e ba&s;e and atrocious actions puni&s;hed as they de&s;erve. But it is not the le&s;s true, that the Pari&s;ians were driven to de&s;pair by the Duke of Brun&s;wick's approach to Paris, and by his infamous manife&s;toes. Bouille's threat of not leaving &s;tone upon &s;tone in the capital, was back|ed by the menaces of the Emigrants. Their cruel conduct on the frontiers plainly &s;howed the inhabitants of Paris what they had to expect. When the whole &s;trength of the city ro&s;e to repel the enemy, they feared that they &s;hould leave their aged fathers, and their defencele&s;s children, to the mercy of a band of con&s;pirator, of which the part that was in the pri&s;ons
<PB N="30" REF="31">was to be &s;et at liberty by their accomplices with|out.</P>
<P>Be this true or fal&s;e, it is certain that &s;uch was their per&s;ua&s;ion; and I have been a&s;&s;ured by a re|&s;pectable French merchant, who mixed, without par|ticipating in the&s;e horrid &s;cenes, that all the pri&s;oners had received a day or two before &s;tockings, &s;triped blue and white, to enable them to recognize each other. Their being in this uniform, he &s;aid he could atte&s;t from his own ob&s;ervation. The nobles and the prie&s;ts had al&s;o their di&s;tinctive marks. If I could doubt the a&s;&s;ertions of numbers who pretend to have &s;een the&s;e marks, I could not ea&s;ily reject the te&s;ti|mony of a youth, too ingenuous to deceive, and too young to invent, who was pre&s;ent at the ma&s;&s;acre in the Convent of Carmelite Friars. He &s;ays, that he &s;aw cards, taken from the brea&s;ts of the murdered prie&s;ts, on which were depicted a royal crown, and a crown of thorns, with the words <HI>Regiment de Salomon</HI> written above, and below <HI>mi&s;erere no&s;tri.</HI> Why then &s;hould an event, enchained with &s;o many incidents and circum&s;tances, be con&s;idered as the natural con|&s;equence of the revolution? Tho&s;e who affect to look upon it in this light, and who would fain make it an argument for the extermination of the new principles of liberty, are not aware, that while the Saint Bar|tholomew in France, and the ma&s;&s;acre of prote&s;tants in Ireland (&s;cenes of blood far le&s;s provoked, and of much greater extent) are upon record; they are not aware, I &s;ay, that their bold conclu&s;ion involves the condemnation of the chri&s;tian religion, and the pro|&s;cription of all kings.</P>
<P>But admitting that the page of hi&s;tory was never &s;o fouly &s;tained before, this is &s;o far from being a rea&s;on for bringing the French under the yoke of their old de&s;poti&s;m, that it is the &s;tronge&s;t argument that can be found for letting them try the experiment of a new government. As the cruelty with which they are re|proached has marked their conduct from the fir&s;t day of the revolution, it is evident that their old govern|ment made them what they are; for who will believe,
<PB N="31" REF="32">that there is any thing in the kindly climate or grate|ful &s;oil of France to render its inhabitants &s;erocious, or that the taking of the Ba&s;tile in&s;tilled this &s;udden venom into their &s;ouls. It is indeed little to be won|dered at, that a people treated like brutes, for &s;o many centuries, &s;hould become like brutes when they broke their chain.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be &s;afer, in this chri&s;tian land, for the man who rejoiced that there were pri&s;ons for the libellers of a queen, to libel a whole nation, and to advi&s;e the cutting of his fellow-creatures throats, from generation to generation, than it is for another to inculcate charity to our neighbours, by a candid &s;tatement of facts, and demon&s;trable truth. But as my tour induced me to relate the things I &s;aw, and as the&s;e things led me naturally to the reflections that accompany the mention of them, I defy reproach, and tru&s;t that my readers will &s;hew &s;ome indulgence to the ha&s;ty production of an un&s;kilful pen.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE EXCELLENCY OF A FREE GO|VERNMENT, AND ITS TENDENCY TO EXALT THE NATURE OF MAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> Dr. Price.</BYLINE>
<P>EVERY Member of a Free State, having his pro|perty &s;ecure, and knowing him&s;elf his own go|vernor, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of dignity in him&s;elf, and feels incitements to emulation and improvement, to which the mi&s;erable &s;laves of arbitrary power mu&s;t be utter &s;trangers. In &s;uch a &s;tate all the &s;prings of action have room to operate, and the mind is &s;timu|lated to the noble&s;t exertions. But to be obliged, from our birth, to look up to a creature no better than our&s;elves, as the ma&s;ter of our fortunes; and to
<PB N="32" REF="33">receive his will as our law&mdash;What can be more hu|miliating? What elevated ideas can enter a mind in &s;uch a &s;ituation?&mdash;Agreeably to this remark, the &s;ubjects of free &s;tates have, in all ages, been mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hed for genius and knowledge. Liberty is the &s;oil where the arts and &s;ciences have flouri&s;hed; and the more free a &s;tate has been, the more have the powers of the human mind been drawn forth into action; and the greater number of BRAVE men has it produced. With what lu&s;tre do the ancient free &s;tates of <HI>Greece</HI> &s;hine in the annals of the world? How different is that country now, under the Great Turk? The difference between a country inhabited by men, and by brutes, is not greater.</P>
<P>The&s;e are reflections which &s;hould be con&s;tantly pre&s;ent to every mind in this country. As <HI>moral</HI> liberty is the prime ble&s;&s;ing of man in his <HI>private</HI> ca|pacity, &s;o is <HI>civil</HI> liberty in his <HI>public</HI> capacity. There is nothing that requires more to be <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hed</HI> than power. There is nothing that ought to be oppo&s;ed with a more determined re&s;olution than its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">roach|ments. Sleep in a &s;tate, as <HI>Monte&s;quien</HI> &s;ays, is always followed by &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The people of this kingdom were once warmed by &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e. Many a &s;ycophant of power have they &s;acrificed. Often have they fought and bled in the cau&s;e of Liberty. But that time &s;eems to be going. The fair inheritance of liberty left us by our ance&s;tors many of us are not unwilling to re&s;ign. An unbounded venality, the in&s;eparable companion of di&s;&s;ipation and extravagance, has poi|&s;oned the &s;prings of public virtue among us: and &s;hould any events ever ari&s;e that &s;hould render the &s;ame oppo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary that took place in the times of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, and <HI>James</HI> the Second, I am afraid all that is valuable to us would be lo&s;t.&mdash; <HI>The terror of the &s;tanding army, the danger of the pub|lic funds, and the all-corrupting influence of the trea&s;ury, would deaden all zeal, and produce general acquie&s;cence and &s;ervility.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KINGS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> THE CANDID PHILOSOPHER.</HEAD>
<P>I ONCE thought that in point of morals the ac|tions of all men, however di&s;tingui&s;hed in rank, &s;tood on the &s;ame footing, and were entitled to the &s;ame prai&s;e or cen&s;ure. I thought that the morality of a monarch and of a private man, as pre&s;cribed by the &s;ame divine authority, were exactly the &s;ame. But I find the world thinks otherwi&s;e. The world thinks, that what is fit and ju&s;t in a &s;ubject is not &s;o in a king; that a king is not bound by tho&s;e narrow rules that were only intended to bind the vulgar herd; and that a king may commit actions which, though highly criminal in a &s;ubject, are not &s;o in him. Owing to the&s;e opinions, a political and prac|tical &s;y&s;tem has been drawn by acute &s;tate&s;men, and metaphy&s;ical lawyers; in which, among other equally judicious principles, they lay it down as a rule, that though in the ca&s;e of a &s;ubject the ma&s;ter is an&s;wer|able for the ill conduct of his &s;ervants, yet in the ca&s;e of a &s;overeign, he is not re&s;pon&s;ible for the errors and mi&s;conduct of his mini&s;ters&punc; So far from it, <HI>they</HI> are accountable for <HI>his</HI> mi&s;conduct and errors, if &s;uch
<PB N="37" REF="38">he <HI>could</HI> commit, for they &s;ay he cannot. They &s;ay he is not a FREE AGENT, but a <HI>more machine.</HI> and as &s;uch can <HI>do no wrong</HI> [therefore can do no right] the rea&s;on of this they tell us is, that the king is always &s;uppo&s;ed to be advi&s;ed by his mini&s;ters, and, there|fore, to imagine he was capable of doing inju&s;tice, or was to be made re&s;pon&s;ible for his actions, would be to de&s;troy his independence. This is paying the king but a very <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> compliment. To repre&s;ent him as a <HI>machine,</HI> and the <HI>mouth-piece</HI> of his mini&s;ters, is treat|ing him as an idiot, or a puppet moved by wires. And with re&s;pect to the <HI>independency</HI> they want to a&s;cribe to the king, I in&s;i&s;t on it they rob him of it entirely, ac|cording to their &s;y&s;tem; and render him the mo&s;t ab|ject, pitiful dependent creature imaginable, dependent on the nod, the wink, the command of his &s;ervants. They make him a very child in leading &s;trings, unfit to walk him&s;elf, but to be led blind-fold wherever his tutors &s;hall be plea&s;ed to drag him. Whether this is the ca&s;e in reality with any king now living, I pre|&s;ume not to &s;ay; but it has been the ca&s;e of multitudes, whom HISTORY has damned to everla&s;ting infamy in her fair and impartial page. If in a point of this delicate nature I may dare to hazard an opinion, I would &s;ay, that I think a king (I mean of Utopia not of England) ought to be per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible for his mi&s;conduct, as much as a private man is for his: that a king ought to be re&s;pon&s;ible for his mi&s;conduct in choo&s;ing igno|rant or wicked mini&s;ters: That though a king takes the advice of others, yet, as advice does not bind his conduct, he is as much accountable for it as the <HI>pri|vate</HI> malefactor would be in taking and pur&s;uing the ill advice of his comrades to rob or murder.</P>

<P>THOU a&s;ke&s;t if the Engli&s;h are as free as hereto|fore? the courtiers a&s;&s;ure me confidently that

<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons is the repre&s;entative of the nation, neverthele&s;s there are many great <HI>towns</HI> which &s;end to deputies thither, and many hamlets, almo&s;t un|inhabited, that have a right of &s;ending <HI>two.</HI> Several members have never &s;een their electors, and &s;everal are elected by the <HI>Paliament,</HI> who were rejected by the <HI>people.</HI> All the electors &s;wear not to &s;ell their voices, yet many of the candidates are undone by the expence of <HI>buying them.</HI> This whole affair is involved in deep mi&s;tery, and inexplicable difficulties.</P>
<P>Thou a&s;ke&s;t if commerce be as flouri&s;hing as for|merly: Some whom I have con&s;ulted upon that head &s;ay, it is now in its meridian; and there is really an appearance of its being &s;o; for luxury is <HI>prodigiou&s;ly</HI> encrea&s;ed, and it is hard to imagine how it can be &s;upported without an inexhau&s;tible trade: But <HI>others</HI> pretend, that <HI>this very luxury</HI> is a proof of its decline; and they add, that the <HI>frauds</HI> and <HI>villanies</HI> in all the trading companies, are &s;o many inward poi&s;ons, which if not &s;peedily expelled, will de&s;troy it entirely in a little time.</P>
<P>Thou would&s;t know if property be &s;o &s;afely guarded as is generally believed: It is certain that the whole power of a King of <HI>England</HI> cannot force an acre of land from the weake&s;t of his &s;ubjects; but a <HI>knavi&s;h attorney</HI> will take away his whole e&s;tate by tho&s;e very <HI>laws</HI> which were de&s;igned for its &s;ecurity: The <HI>judges</HI> are uncorrupt, <HI>appeals</HI> are free, and notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e advantages it is u&s;ually better for a man to lo&s;e his right than to &s;ue for it.</P>

<HEAD>A LESSON FOR GENTLEMEN VOLUN|TEERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From the</HI> LETTERS OF A PERSIAN IN ENGLAND TO HIS FRIEND AT ISPAHAN.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was walking in the fields, near this city, the other morning, a di&s;banded &s;oldier, &s;ome|what in years, implored my charity, and to excite my compa&s;&s;ion, bared his bo&s;om, on which were the &s;cars of many wounds, all received in the &s;ervice of his country. I gladly relieved his wants, and being de&s;irous to inform my&s;elf of every thing, fell into di&s;cour&s;e with him on the wars in which he had &s;erved. He told me he had been pre&s;ent at the taking of ten or twelve &s;trong towns, and had a &s;hare in the danger and glory of almo&s;t as many victories. How then, &s;aid I, comes it to pa&s;s that you are laid a&s;ide? Thy &s;trength is indeed in its decline, but not yet wa&s;ted; and I &s;hould think that experience would well &s;upply the lo&s;s of youth. Alas! Sir, an&s;wered he, I have a good heart, and tolerable limbs, but I want three inches more of &s;tature: I am brave and able enough, thank God, but not quite hand&s;ome enough to be a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>How then did&s;t thou &s;erve &s;o long, returned I, in <HI>Flanders?</HI> Sir, &s;aid he, there were &s;ome thou&s;ands &s;uch ill-looking fellows, who did very well in the day
<PB N="41" REF="42">of battle, but would make no figure at a review.&mdash;It appears to me very &s;trange, replied I, that thou &s;hould|e&s;t be poor after fighting &s;o many years with &s;uch great &s;ucce&s;s. The plunder of a &s;ingle town in the <HI>ea&s;t</HI> is enough to enrich every &s;oldier that helped to take it. Plunder! Sir, &s;aid he; we have no &s;uch term in the modern art of war. We fight for &s;ixpence a day.&mdash;But when you have gained a battle do you get nothing by it?&mdash;Yes, &s;aid he, we have the ad|vantage to go on and be&s;iege a town.&mdash;Ay, then, my hone&s;t lad, comes your harve&s;t.&mdash;Then, Sir, replied he, it defends it&s;elf till we are half of us de&s;troyed: and when it can hold out no longer, it capitulates; that is, every burgher &s;aves his hou&s;e, and every &s;oldier carries off his baggage.&mdash;What becomes of the conquering army?&mdash;Why the conquering army has the plea&s;ure to be&s;iege another town, which capitulates al&s;o; and at the end of the campaign it goes into quarters.&mdash;But when you enter an enemy's country don't you rai&s;e contributions? The generals do, an|&s;wered he, but military di&s;cipline allows no part of it to the common &s;oldiers; they have ju&s;t &s;ixpence a day as they had before.</P>

<P>Should we now unbowel and trace to its original this name, for which there have of late appeared &s;o many advocates, I pre&s;ume it would be found of as ill complexion as the word <HI>Tyrant</HI> was accounted among the Greeks; the Engli&s;h word <HI>king,</HI> being but the abbreviate of <HI>cunning,</HI> the u&s;ual epithet (as all men know) of knaves; and to &s;peak truth, expe|rience hath made good, though never &s;o great a &s;aint hath &s;ate upon the throne, the devil and a bi&s;hop have ever &s;tept into the office: For I am not of that fond opinion, that <HI>kings</HI> are not capable in their pri|vate capacities of like virtues and qualifications with other men; but that, notwith&s;tanding their accom|pli&s;hments, how excellent, how bright, how orient &s;oever are their per&s;onal virtues, they &s;tand on &s;lip|pery places, and their dignities, their intere&s;ts, their para&s;ites, their flatterers, are &s;nares too great for them to retain their integrity, and therefore that the ta|lent of &s;overeign power is too great, too precious to be intru&s;ted or depo&s;ited, in one man's hand, though an <HI>angel,</HI> left &s;o great a <HI>temptation</HI> &s;hould endanger his fall, and make him apo&s;tate to a devil.</P>
<P>That kings are God's &s;courges, and given in wrath,
<PB N="48" REF="49">we have the te&s;timony of &s;cripture. <HI>Nimrod</HI> was a great hunter, a mighty man, a great oppre&s;&s;or, and the fir&s;t king or prince we read of; the fir&s;t that invaded the liberty of the world, that u&s;urped fir&s;t authority, and pre&s;umed to exerci&s;e dominion over his brethren; the fir&s;t that put a period to that golden age, wherein no other than paternal government was known; but though thus nigh the morning of time, God &s;ent his &s;courge <HI>Nimrod</HI> as a ju&s;t plague among&s;t the other nations of the earth; yet the people of God, the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were a long while after free, a free &s;tate, and enjoyed their native liberties till the time of <HI>Samuel,</HI> when they rebelled, and de&s;ired a king like the other nations, that they might be like the heathen whom God had ca&s;t out before them; which God con&s;trued no other than apo&s;tacy, and rejecting of him, than rebellion and high trea&s;on again&s;t his own divine maje&s;ty; and &s;aid, <HI>They have rejected me:</HI> And then tells them what would be the i&s;&s;ue, fruit, and product thereof.</P>
<P>They &s;hould give away their liberty, and be &s;ub|jected to an arbitrary power, and become the &s;laves and va&s;&s;als of their king, who &s;hould take their &s;ons and their daughters to make them his &s;ervants, and &s;end them forth to fight his battles; that is, to be the in&s;truments of his pride and luxury, and the cham|pions of his malice and ambition.</P>
<P>And then he &s;hould de&s;troy their property, and take away their hou&s;es, and their vineyards, and give them to his &s;ervants. Thus the &s;pirit of God gives the &s;ame de&s;cription of a <HI>King</HI> as of what we call a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> a <HI>Nero,</HI> a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> as if they were all one, and it were e&s;&s;ential to the nature of the office or dignity to be a <HI>bea&s;t of prey, a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">viathan,</HI> an oppre&s;&s;or and de|vourer of the people; which character hath been too ea&s;y to be read in the lives of mo&s;t of the be&s;t kings, who&s;e names are not taken off the file of memory.</P>

<P>One of the grand arguments whereby the betrayers of our liberty endeavour to decoy us into the iron yoke, we have &s;o lately &s;haken of, is taken from our long u&s;e and cu&s;tom to draw therein, which hath rendered &s;lavery a &s;econd nature to us, and therefore endeavour to &s;care us from our liberty as a novel and dangerous thing; as if &s;ervitude were more natural to a nation than freedom, or any cu&s;tom could utterly expunge nature: I am &s;ure the former cannot reflect with the greater di&s;grace, or more derogate from the honour of our nation, that we &s;hould be of &s;o coar&s;e a metal, &s;o ba&s;e an alloy, of &s;o &s;paniel-like couchant, &s;lavi&s;h, and degenerate a &s;pirit, than the other doth deviate from truth; but the worthy advocates of this cau&s;e, mea&s;ure truth by the wicked &s;tandard of their ba&s;e and corrupt de&s;igns, as they take altitude of all other mens &s;pirits, though never &s;o brave and eleva|ted by the Jacob's &s;taff of their own pitiful crouch|ing, fawning humour.</P>

But without doubt, tho&s;e brave and gallant &s;ouls, by the conduct of who&s;e valour and prudence we have broken the iron yoke of arbitrary and exorbitant power; and by the good providence of God, redeemed the captivity of our nation, from the unrighteous bonds of its wicked oppre&s;&s;ors, are worthy of, and know how to prize and improve what hath been pur|cha&s;ed with &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eat and oil, and will not in the end &s;ell their birth-right for a me&s;s of pottage, but leave an offspring, heirs of their own valour and gal|lantry, that will, with the utmo&s;t peril of their lives and fortunes, de&s;end and pre&s;erve what the labours of their ance&s;tors hath purcha&s;ed, with &s;ore travel both of mind and body, and &s;o tran&s;mit it intire to their po&s;terity, through msny generations, till the con&s;ummation of all things, and that time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>But for a farther and more fatisfactory an&s;wer, to &s;ilence this argument, we may con&s;ider how the &s;cene is changed, and balance of lands altered &s;ince the&s;e la&s;t centuries; and by rea&s;on thereof, with how great difficulty monarchy hath made good its ground &s;ince Henry the Eighth's days, in which it fir&s;t began mo&s;t vi&s;ible to decline, and hath ever &s;ince been po&s;t|ing to its period.</P>
<P>For that wilful prince, by alienating the church revenues, quite altered the balance of lands that was the ba&s;is of his government, and thereby did that &s;ervice unawares, that pulled up the &s;take of monar|chy: for the church (which with all its preferments, was at the king's devotion and &s;ole di&s;po&s;e) did at that time po&s;&s;e&s;s a third part of the lands and wealth
<PB N="52" REF="53">of the whole nation: which being afterwards &s;old, and coming into the hands of private men, &s;et up many thou&s;ands of families that had no dependence on the crown. Since which time, the number of freeholders being much encrea&s;ed, the nation hath had a natural and &s;trong vergency towards a com|monwealth; which hath been much di&s;covered in the &s;pirit and complexion of our parliaments, of which the hou&s;e of commons (heretofore an incon&s;iderable truckling kind of court, that was only &s;ummoned for the Prince to milk their pur&s;es, and let the peo|ple blood in the &s;ilver vein) grew now more peremp|tory, and began to give check to their princes exor|bitances; in&s;omuch, that Queen Elizabeth was put to her court&s;hip to retain them in allegiance; as after|wards King James, to a thou&s;and &s;hifts and juggles: who, notwith&s;tanding all his King-craft and cunning, in which he &s;o much gloried, and boa&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o great a ma&s;ter, was &s;carce able, with much juggling and di&s;&s;imulation, to divert the &s;torm from falling on his own head, which afterward rained &s;o much blood and vengeance on his &s;on and po&s;terity, to the utter ruin and confu&s;ion of his family.</P>
<P>To conclude therefore this particular, it being a maxim of truth, placed beyond all hazard of contra|diction, that no government can be fixed in this nation, but according to the balance of land. That Prince that is not able, neither by his own nor the public revenue, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to counterpoi&s;e, if not over balance the greater part of the people, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be tenant at will for the crown he wears: for they that are the proprietors of the land and wealth of any nation, will with ea&s;e be able, by that magneti&s;m, to draw the greate&s;t number of abettors to their &s;ide, and &s;o to gild over their preten&s;ions, as to render them current with the people, and &s;o in the end, give law to the re&s;t of their brethren: Therefore, where there is one proprietor or landlord, as in Turkey, there is ab&s;olute monarchy; where a few, ari&s;tocracy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ince the crown lands, and church lands of
<PB N="53" REF="54">this nation are &s;old, what other prop or pillar of &s;ecuri|ty is left for the throne of a prince to re&s;t upon, ex|cept that of a mercenary army, lies not within view of my apprehen&s;ions; and then how whole&s;ome or &s;afe advice the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of monarchy is to this nation, I leave all men (that have not altogether ab|jured their rea&s;on and con&s;cience, to judge and deter|mine.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e poetical, if not prophane flouri&s;hes, wherewith orators and poets, the con&s;tant para&s;ites of princes, u&s;e to gild over monarchy, pretending it the mo&s;t natural and rational of all other forms of government, and that who&s;e pattern was fir&s;t &s;hown in the mount, or rather let down from heaven, para|le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling it with God's regimen of the univer&s;e, which is alledged as its prototype fir&s;t <HI>exemplar;</HI> and there|fore to have &s;omething more of a divine right and character impre&s;&s;ed upon it than any other, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I &s;ay, are &s;uch trite, bald, and &s;light rea|&s;onings, that they do not merit &s;o much re&s;pect as to receive an an&s;wer; for may we not as well by this loo&s;e and allu&s;ive way of arguing, borrow a pattern from heaven for the triumvirate, that Augu&s;tus, Le|pidus, and Mare Antony &s;ometime impo&s;ed on Rome.</P>
<P>Doth it not as well quadrate with the &s;acred Trinity, by the triple &s;ceptred of who&s;e divine providence the empire of the world is admini&s;tered, as by their's &s;ometime that of the Romans? Will any one therefore be &s;o bold as to &s;ay, that it was the mo&s;t natural and rational government, and founded by no le&s;s than a di|vine right, according to its pattern and archetype in the heavens! notwith&s;tanding the brand of the blacke&s;t and bloodie&s;t tyranny Rome ever &s;aw hath been &s;et thereon, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Or may we not, con&s;idering the pride, ambition, rapine, extortion, injury and oppre&s;&s;ion, that u&s;ually crowd into the courts of the be&s;t princes, with as much or more rea&s;on parallel ab&s;olute monarchy, with that of the prince of darkne&s;s, in which there is no Tri|nity, as in the other; and therefore more exactly
<PB N="54" REF="55">quadrate to the ab&s;olutene&s;s our proud monarchs &s;o much endeavour to obtain?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, could we have a prince to whom maje&s;ty might be atributed, without prophane hyperboles, that was a true vicar or lieutenant of God, that was not &s;ubject to the pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities, much le&s;s the vices and mon&s;tro&s;ities of human nature, that could neither be impo&s;ed on by deceit, nor abu&s;ed by flattery, whom the pa&s;&s;ions neither of fear nor affection, could warp to the lea&s;t declivity, from what is right and hone&s;t; who&s;e rea&s;on could never be bia&s;&s;ed by any private intere&s;t or ba&s;e re&s;pect, to decline the paths of ju&s;tice and equity, but would manage the reins of his power with a like con&s;tan|cy and &s;teadine&s;s, as by the hand of Providence the helm of the univer&s;e is &s;teered: I &s;hould then become an advocate of monarchy, and acknowledge it to have the impre&s;s of divinity, and bear the character and in&s;cription of God upon it, to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute form of government, and a true copy of its divine original: but till &s;ecurity be given for &s;uch a righteous admini&s;tration, I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed from being a pander to ambition, or the advocate of ty|ranny, as having learnt, <HI>It is not good for man to be alone,</HI> e&s;pecially on the high and &s;lippery places, where the &s;tronge&s;t heads are apt to wax giddy; but, <HI>in the multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety:</HI> and methinks, the very dialect of princes in the plural number (what|ever of &s;tate or maje&s;ty may be pretended) is a witne&s;s of, and doth clearly &s;peak the unnaturalne&s;s of &s;uch exorbitant monopolies of power, and that though they act in a &s;ingle capacity, are willing to &s;peak like a commonwealth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the other arguments, of which the advo|cates of tyranny make u&s;e, are drawn from the pre|tended advantages of that government, above and be|yond others in re&s;pect of &s;ecrecy, celerity, unanimity, and the like, which though conveniencies, yet being far too light to counterpoi&s;e and balance the other in commodities, together with the great charge and ex|ci&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="56">they are rated at, require no other an&s;wer, nor &s;hall I wa&s;te more time and ink upon them.</P>
<P>Having thus pa&s;&s;ed the pikes of the &s;harpe&s;t argu|ments, that are u&s;ually rai&s;ed in defence of the odd thing called a &s;ingle per&s;on, I &s;hall only &s;peak a word or two to that is founded on the &s;ingle command, that in times of war and eminent danger, when the gates of Janus's temple are &s;et open, is committed to one man, it being a received maxim, that rea&s;on hath always conceded an advantage to the ab&s;olute juri&s;diction of a &s;ingle per&s;on in the field, pre&s;cribing to that end but one general to an army, for fear of divi&s;ions upon contrary coun&s;els and commands.</P>
<P>To which may be replied, notwith&s;tanding ge|nerals are not taken upon tru&s;t, as <HI>kings</HI> in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <HI>monarchies,</HI> but upon the te&s;t of experience, and proved &s;ufficiency manife&s;ted in former &s;ervices; yet if it &s;eem expedient to the <HI>commonwealth,</HI> there may be a rotation in that office as well as others, as was anci|ently in the <HI>Roman republic,</HI> who&s;e armies were led forth by their annual &s;ucce&s;&s;ive con&s;uls, and that with great &s;ucce&s;s and victory.</P>
<P>But the expedient our pre&s;ent parliament hath found out by commi&s;&s;ion, doth &s;o fully an&s;wer this objection that I need &s;ay no more unto it; for without doubt, it is the intere&s;t of a free &s;tate to have all the people &s;o trained up in military di&s;cipline, and made fami|liar with arms, that he may not be thought arrived at the ju&s;t accompli&s;hments of a gentleman, that is not able to lead an army in the field, it being among the Romans no ab&s;urd apo&s;trophe to leave the plough|tail, to head an army, or, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> when their military employments were accompli&s;hed: how much then may they be thought to fall &s;hort of the accompli&s;hments of a gentleman, that know not how to manage the conduct of a troop of hor&s;e, as I fear, too many of our gentry, upon a due &s;crutiny would be found; who, notwith&s;tanding all their great pre|tences to be accounted <HI>armigeri,</HI> or e&s;quires, are &s;carce &s;tout enough to di&s;charge a pi&s;tol, or were

<P>I &s;hall now &s;ound a retreat to the further progre&s;s of my pen on this theme, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem too much to triumph over a baffled and pro&s;trate enemy, it being my de&s;ire to u&s;e victory with like modera|tion, I de&s;ire to bear a foil, conque&s;t or captivity: therefore, fince by the good providence of God, together with the gallant conduct of the no le&s;s pru|dent than valiant a&s;&s;ertors of our native rights and liberties, we are re-in&s;tated in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our birth-rights, I &s;hall attempt the di&s;covery of tho&s;e rocks and &s;helves, on which in the late night of <HI>apo&s;|tacy</HI> we &s;plit our liberties, and endanger the utter ruin and &s;hipwreck of our lives and fortunes, in the dangerous &s;ea of an exorbitant and unlimited <HI>power;</HI> and thereby &s;trike &s;ome &s;parks of light for the future better &s;teering of the commonwealth, in who&s;e bot|tom, as all our lives and felicities are adventured, we are all concerned to endeavour its being brought into a &s;afe port and harbour.</P>
<P>The work then of our pre&s;ent pilots, that &s;it at the &s;tern, and manage the conduct of our affairs, is, to endeavour the commonwealth may be &s;o equally ba|lanced, as it may neither have propen&s;ity to a &s;econd relap&s;e into monarchy, as of late; or <HI>oligarchy,</HI> which is wor&s;e: nor yet into <HI>anarchy,</HI> the wor&s;t of all three: But to &s;ettle a free-&s;tate upon &s;uch ju&s;t and righteous foundations as cannot be moved, that may be a &s;trong rampire of defence, not only to our civil liberties, as men, from the future enchroachment of tyranny, or inundation of exorbitant power; but al&s;o of &s;ecurity to our &s;piritual liberties, as Chri&s;tians, from the inva&s;ion of tho&s;e that de&s;ire to domineer and lord it over the con&s;ciences of their brethren: both which &s;eem &s;o linked and twi&s;ted to each other, that what conduces to the &s;ecurity of one, hath no &s;mail tendency to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the other al&s;o, and do commonly &s;o in&s;eparable accompany each other, that where&s;oever there is a free-&s;tate, or equal

<P>Now, for the better &s;ecuring of the&s;e, we are to take notice of what per&s;ons or things are mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent with, and have greate&s;t enmity to, the intere&s;t of a free-&s;tate or equal commonwealth.</P>
<P>For di&s;covery of which, as I know it a crime of pre&s;umption unpardonable, for one &s;eated in the vale of a private condition, to pretend a fairer pro&s;pect into the intere&s;t of &s;tate, than tho&s;e Providence hath placed in the watch-towers, and on the pinnacles of power; yet by rea&s;on a by-&s;tander may be allowed to di&s;cern &s;omething of the game; and he that is out of play, to &s;hew the ground to a bowler; and one that &s;tands below may better know what props the foundation re&s;ts upon, than he that is on the top of the tower: and it being the duty of every one to ca&s;t in his mite to the va&s;ter trea&s;ures of their know|ledge, to whom Providence hath committed the conduct of our affairs, I am bold, being partly thereto encouraged by that great candour where|with I ob&s;erve the like tribute of zealous and faithful hearts are already received, to tender what in my apprehen&s;ion may have a tendency to a future &s;ettlement and &s;ecurity. I confe&s;s, were we at this time bowed down under the govern|ment of a monarch, in who&s;e court every coun|&s;ellor of &s;tate is to be taken on an implicit faith to enjoy by his prince's patent and favour, a monopoly of rea&s;on as well as honour; and that his under&s;tand|ing is no le&s;s elevated than according to the propor|tion his titles and fortunes &s;well above the tide of other mens: I might ju&s;tly be accounted ab&s;urd to offer any thing of this nature, as knowing with what &s;corn and contempt &s;o ra&s;h an adventure would be encountered.</P>

<HEAD>Every Man is born with an impre&s;criptible Claim to a Portion of the Elements.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a truth, I believe, not to be called in que&s;tion, that every man is born with an impre&s;criptible claim to a portion of the elements, which portion is termed his <HI>birth-right.</HI> Society may vary this right, as to its form, but never can de&s;troy it in &s;ub|&s;tance. She has no controul over the man till he is born; and the right being born with him, and being nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;tence, &s;he can no more annihilate the one than the other, though &s;he has the power of new-modelling both. But on coming into the world, he finds that the ground which nature had promi&s;ed him is taken up, and in the occupancy of others; &s;ociety has changed the form of his birth-right; the general &s;tock of elements, from which the lives of men are to be &s;upported, has undergone a new modi|fication; and his portion among the re&s;t. He is told, that he cannot claim it in its pre&s;ent form, as an in|dependent inheritance; that he mu&s;t draw on the &s;tock of &s;ociety, in&s;tead of the &s;tock of nature; that he is bani&s;hed from the mother and mu&s;t cleave to the nur&s;e. In this unexpected occurrence he is un|prepared to act; but knowledge is a part of the &s;tock of &s;ociety: and an indi&s;pen&s;ible part to be allotted to the portion of the claimant, is <HI>in&s;truction</HI> relative to the new arrangement of natural right. To with|hold this in&s;truction, therefore, would be not merely the omi&s;&s;ion of a duty, but the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime; and &s;ociety in this ca&s;e would &s;in again&s;t the man, before the man could &s;in again&s;t &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hope to meet the a&s;&s;ent of all unprejudiced readers, in carrying this idea &s;till further. In ca&s;es where a per&s;on is born of poor parents, or finds him&s;elf brought into the community of men, without the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, &s;ociety is bound in duty to furni&s;h him with the means. She ought not only to in&s;truct him in the arti|ficial laws by which property is &s;ecured, but in the arti|ficial indu&s;try by which it is obtained. She is bound in
<PB N="61" REF="62"><HI>ju&s;tice</HI> as well as policy, to give him &s;ome art or trade. For the rea&s;on of his incapacity is, that <HI>&s;he</HI> has u&s;urped his birth-right; and this re&s;toring it to him in another form, more convenient to both parties. The failure of &s;ociety in this branch of her duty, is the occa&s;ion of much the greater part of the evils that call for criminal juri&s;prudence. The indi|vidual feels that he is robbed of his natural right; he cannot bring his proce&s;s to reclaim it from the great community by which he is overpowered; he there|fore feels authorized in repri&s;al; in taking another's goods to replace his own. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in numberle&s;s in&s;tances the conduct of &s;ociety ju&s;tifies him in this proceeding, &s;he has &s;eized <HI>his</HI> pro|perty and commenced the war again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Some, who perceive the&s;e truths, &s;ay that it is un&s;afe for &s;ociety to publi&s;h them; but I &s;ay it is un&s;afe not to publi&s;h them. For the party from which the mi&s;chief is expected to ari&s;e, has the knowledge of them already, and has acted upon them in all ages. It is the wi&s;e who are ignorant of the&s;e things, and not the fooli&s;h. They are truths of na|ture; and in them the teachers of mankind are the only party that remains to be taught: It is a &s;ubject on which the logic of indigence is much clearer than that of opulence. The latter rea&s;ons from contri|vance, the former from feeling; and God has not endowed us with fal&s;e feelings, in things that &s;o weightily concern our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>None can deny that the obligation is much &s;tronger on me to &s;upport my life, than to &s;upport the claim that my neighbour has to his property. Nature commands the fir&s;t, &s;ociety the &s;econd:&mdash;In one I obey the laws of God, which are univer&s;al and eter|nal; in the other the laws of man, which are local and temporary.</P>
<P>It has been the folly of old governments to begin every thing at the wrong end, and to erect their in|&s;titutions on an inver&s;ion of principle. This is more
<PB N="62" REF="63">&s;adly the ca&s;e in their &s;y&s;tems of juri&s;prudence, than is commonly imagined. <HI>Compelling</HI> ju&s;tice is always mi&s;taken for <HI>rendering</HI> ju&s;tice. But this important branch of admini&s;tration con&s;i&s;ts not merely in com|pelling men to be ju&s;t to each other, and individuals to &s;ociety,&mdash;this is not the whole, nor is it the prin|cipal part, nor even the beginning, of the operation. The &s;ource of power is &s;aid to be the &s;ource of ju&s;tice; but it does not an&s;wer this de&s;cription, as long as it contents it&s;elf with <HI>compul&s;ion.</HI> Ju&s;tice mu&s;t begin by flowing from its &s;ource; and the fir&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t important object is, to open its channels from &s;ociety to all the individual members. This part of the admini&s;tration being well devi&s;ed and diligently executed, the other parts would le&s;&s;en away by de|grees to matters of inferior con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It is an undoubted truth, that our duty is in&s;epa|rably connected with our happine&s;s; and why &s;hould we de&s;pair of convincing every member of &s;ociety of a truth &s;o important for him to know? Should any per&s;on object, by &s;aying, that nothing like this has ever been tried. Society has hitherto been cur&s;t with governments who&s;e exi&s;tence depended on the ex|tinction of truth. Every moral light has been &s;mo|thered under the bu&s;hel of perpetual impo&s;ition; from whence it emits but faint and glimmering rays, al|ways in&s;ufficient to form any luminous &s;y&s;tem on any of the civil concerns of men. But the&s;e covers are crumbling to the du&s;t, with the governments which they &s;upport; and the probability becomes more ap|parent, the more it is con&s;idered, that &s;ociety is capable of curing all the evils to which it has given birth.</P>

<HEAD>HOW TO CONSTITUTE A FREE GOVERN|MENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> CATO'S LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE only Secret in forming a Free Government, is to make the intere&s;ts of the Governors and of the Governed the &s;ame, as far as human policy can contrive. Liberty cannot be pre&s;erved any other way. Men have long found, from the weakne&s;s and depravity of them&s;elves and one another, that mo&s;t men will act for intere&s;t again&s;t duty, as often as they dare. So that to engage them to their duty, intere&s;t mu&s;t be linked to the ob&s;ervance of it, and danger to the breach of it. Per&s;onal advantages and &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be the rewards of duty and obedience; and di&s;|grace, torture, and death, the puni&s;hment of treach|ery and corruption.</P>
<P>Human wi&s;dom has yet found out but one certain expedient to effect this; and that is, to have the con|cerns of all directed by all, as far as po&s;&s;ibly can be: and where the per&s;ons intere&s;ted are too numerous, or live too di&s;tant to meet together on all emergencies, they mu&s;t moderate nece&s;&s;ity by prudence, and act by deputies who&s;e intere&s;t is the &s;ame with their own, and who&s;e property is &s;o intermingled with theirs, and &s;o engaged upon the &s;ame bottom, that princi|pals and deputies mu&s;t &s;tand and fall together. When the deputies thus act for their own intere&s;t, by acting for the intere&s;t of their principals; when they can make no law but what they them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to; when they can give no money, but what they mu&s;t pay their &s;hare of; when they can do no mi&s;chief, but what mu&s;t fall upon their own heads in common with their countrymen; their principals may then expect good laws, little mi&s;chief, and much frugality.</P>
<P>Here therefore lies the great point of nece&s;&s;ity and care in forming the con&s;titution, that the per&s;ons en|tru&s;ted
<PB N="64" REF="65">and repre&s;enting, &s;hall either never have an intere&s;t detached from the per&s;ons entru&s;ting and re|pre&s;ented, or never the means to pur&s;ue it. Now to compa&s;s this great point effectually, no other way is left but one of the&s;e two, or rather both, namely, to make the deputies &s;o numerous, that there may be no po&s;&s;ibility of corrupting the majority; or, by changing them &s;o often, that there is no &s;ufficient time to corrupt them, and to carry the ends of that corruption. The people may be very &s;ure, that the major part of their deputies being hone&s;t will keep the re&s;t &s;o; and that they will all be hone&s;t, when they have no temptations to be knaves.</P>

<HEAD>Tran&s;lation of an Extract from a late Publication, intituled, Les Ruines, by M. De Volney, Member of the late Con&s;titutive National A&s;&s;embly of France, and author of "Travels in Syria and Egypt."</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[This book is &s;uppo&s;ed to be written on the Ruins of Palmyra, where a Spectre, or Genius, appears to the Author, and after taking him up into the Heavens, &s;hews him below, our Hemi&s;phere: ac|counts for pa&s;t, and foretels many future Revo|lutions; after which the work thus proceeds:]</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE had the genius fini&s;hed the&s;e words, be|fore an immen&s;e noi&s;e was heard towards the we&s;t, when that way directing my attention, I perceived within the extremity of the Mediterranean, within the domains of one of the nations of Europe, a pro|digious movement, &s;uch as when, in the bo&s;om of a
<PB N="70" REF="71">va&s;t city, a violent &s;edition breaking out in all its parts, one &s;ees an innumerable people agitated and ru&s;hing like torrents into the &s;treets and public places. And my ears, &s;truck with &s;houts which rent the &s;kie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, di&s;tingui&s;hed at intervals the&s;e phra&s;es.</P>
<P>"What is then this prodigy? What is this cruel and my&s;terious &s;courge? We are a numerous nation, yet we want hands! We have an excellent &s;oil, and we want nece&s;&s;aries! We are active, laborious, and we live in indigence! We pay enormous taxes, and yet we are told they are not &s;ufficient! We are at peace abroad, and neither our per&s;ons nor our pro|perty are in &s;afety at home! What is then the con|cealed enemy which devours us?"</P>
<P>And certain voices, i&s;&s;uing from the bo&s;om of the multitude, an&s;wered, "Erect a di&s;tinct &s;tandard, around which let all tho&s;e a&s;&s;emble who, by u&s;eful labours, &s;upport and nouri&s;h &s;ociety; and you will then di&s;cover the enemy which con&s;umes you."</P>
<P>And the &s;tandard being rai&s;ed, the nation was all at once divided into two bodies, unequal, and of an a&s;pect in all re&s;pects different from each other: the one innumerable and comparatively almo&s;t total, pre&s;ented in the general poverty of their apparel, and in the meagre tanned air of their countenance, ap|pearances of mi&s;ery and labour; the &s;mall group, an incon&s;iderable fraction, pre&s;ented in all the &s;plen|dour of clothes, bedaubed with gold and &s;ilver, and in the plumpne&s;s of their faces, &s;ymptoms of lei&s;ure and abundance. And, con&s;idering the&s;e men more attentively, I perceived that the great body was com|po&s;ed of labourers, of ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">izans, of &s;hopkeepers, of all the profe&s;&s;ions u&s;eful to &s;ociety; and that in the &s;mall group there were only prie&s;ts of the higher orders, financiers, nobles, great officers of armies: in a word, nothing but the civil, military, and reli|gious agents of government.</P>
<P>After the&s;e two bodies had, in the pre&s;ence of each other, face to face, con&s;idered one another with a&s;toni&s;hment, I &s;aw indignation and rage &s;pring
<PB N="71" REF="72">up on the one hand, and a kind of fear and di&s;may on the other; when the great body &s;aid to the &s;mall one &mdash;.</P>

<P>And the <HI>Civil Governors</HI> &s;aid, "This people is mild, and naturally &s;ervile, let us &s;peak to them of the king and of the law, and they will pre&s;ently re-enter into their duty. People! The king wills it, the &s;overeign ordains it."</P>

<P>Nor do I find that the apo&s;tles, and tho&s;e &s;ent forth by Chri&s;t, to be the Catholic Bi&s;hops of the whole earth, and to teach all nations, did a&s;&s;ume unto them&s;elves any di&s;tinction of garb, colour, or habits, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t of Chri&s;t's flock; and I have read of &s;ome that were cen&s;ured in the primitive times, or fir&s;t centuries, for wearing large black cloaks; for what is this but to bring back tho&s;e jewi&s;h types and &s;hadows, to cloud and ob&s;cure the brightne&s;s of the Go&s;pel's di&s;pen&s;ation, that were long &s;ince di&s;pelled and abrogated by the ri&s;ing of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s upon the world? For as one who hath lately well ob&s;erved, What is the canonical girdle, and formality of doctors wearing boots, but as types and allu&s;ions to tho&s;e places, of having their loins, girt, and their feet &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel, &amp;c?</P>
<P>Nor do I read that they who were called to the mini&s;try, did look upon that as a writ of ca&s;e, or &s;ufficient warrant to quit their other particular callings, trades, and vocations; but that Paul wrought with his hands, that he might not become burden&s;ome; and it is generally pre&s;umed our Sa|viour wrought at his father's trade; not that I would not have tho&s;e that mini&s;ter in &s;piritual things, reap of other's carnal; but that it &s;eems more ac|cording to the rule and pre&s;ident of the go&s;pel, that they &s;hould be content with what voluntary con|tribution,
<PB N="76" REF="77">God &s;hall move the people's hearts unto, than by force and rigour of law exact a maintenance.</P>
<P>And when I find the apo&s;tle &s;aluting the church in Cae&s;ar's family, I am prompted to wi&s;h, that all our hou&s;es were chapels unto the Lord, and that our families (like that of Cae&s;ar's) contained a church within them. I am &s;ure it is no new ob|&s;ervation, that the greate&s;t heat and zeal of religion hath been always found in conventicles and private meetings; which &s;ugge&s;ts unto my thoughts, no &s;mall ground of &s;u&s;picion, that our parochial churches, bells, together with the whole order, pomp, method, and formality of our national cler|gy, and public wor&s;hip, &s;tands upon no other foundation than that of human invention, which by the &s;tream of corrupt times, have been carried beyond the pattern and pre&s;ident of the primitive ages, and become very unlike and di&s;&s;onant to the examplar Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles left us.</P>
<P>Nor am I &s;atisfied, if the generality of men are uncapable of receiving the truth and power of godline&s;s, whether the endeavours of giving all men a tincture of religion, and forcing them into the garb and livery of an outward profe&s;&s;ion, which is the great de&s;ign of, and plea for a national clergy be more acceptable unto God than morality. I know under the law, God had a peculiar people, that were picked and culled (as it were) from the dro&s;s and rubbi&s;h of the re&s;t of mankind, that were to be built up in an outward profe&s;&s;ion, and nati|onal way of public wor&s;hip, adorned with many ceremonies, together with much pomp, and out|ward &s;plendour, but whether religion be not now under the go&s;pel, a more inward, refined, &s;piritual and le&s;s vi&s;ible thing. I humbly &s;ubmit to &s;erious con&s;ideration. And if I am herein mi&s;taken (for I pretend not to infallibility) I &s;hould be thankful to any, God &s;hall be plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of as in|&s;truments to better inform me; for I would wil|lingly &s;ee and know my errors.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">But if it be here objected, that the primitive times were times of per&s;ecution, in which the church was (as it were) under hatches, and chri&s;|tianity in its infancy, and the profe&s;&s;ors thereof forced to hide them&s;elves in holes of the rocks, and caves of the earth; but now, having gained ground upon the world, and being in better plight, and &s;ince it is come up out of Egypt from the hou&s;e of bondage, from under the pre&s;&s;ures, per&s;ecutions, afflictions, and burdens of the heatheni&s;h ta&s;k-ma&s;|ters, under which it formerly groaned, ought ac|cording to the example of the I&s;raelites, be adorn|ed with the &s;poils of the heathen, &amp;c.</P>

<P>He knows nothing, that knows not how &s;uper|&s;titiou&s;ly, the generality of mankind is given to retain traditions, and how pertinacious they are in the maintenance of their fir&s;t prejudices, in&s;omuch that a di&s;covery or more refined rea&s;on is as in&s;up|portable to them, as the &s;un is to an eye, newly brought out of darkne&s;s.

<HEAD>THE FREE NOTIONS OF THE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM THE PERSIAN LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the nations of Europe are not under equal &s;ubjection to their princes: for in&s;tance, the impatient humour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;eldom gives the king lei&s;ure to extend or &s;trengthen his authority: Submi&s;&s;ion and obedience are virtues they very lit|tle value them&s;elves upon. They, hold very ex|traordinary opinions about this article. According to them there is but one tie that has any effect upon men, which is that of gratitude: a hu&s;band, a wife, a father, a &s;on, are bound to each other by nothing, but either the love they bear to each other, or mu|tual &s;ervices and benefits; and the&s;e various mo|tives of acknowledgement, are the origin of all kingdoms, and all &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>But if a prince, in&s;tead of endeavouring to make his &s;ubjects happy, &s;tudies only how to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy them, the foundation of obedience cea&s;es; nothing ties, nothing obliges them to him, and they return to their natural liberty. They maintain that no unlimited power can be lawful, becau&s;e it could never have a lawful beginning. For we cannot, &s;ay they, give to another more power over us than we have over our&s;elves: Now we have not an unli|mited power over our&s;elves; for in&s;tance, we can|not touch our own lives; no man upon earth there|fore, conclude they, can have &s;uch a power.</P>
<P>High trea&s;on, according to them, is nothing but a crime committed by the weaker again&s;t the
<PB N="86" REF="87">&s;tronger, by di&s;obeying him, let him di&s;obey him in what way he will. And accordingly the people of <HI>England,</HI> happening to prove the &s;tronger in a con|tention with one of their kings, declared it to be high trea&s;on in a prince to make war upon his &s;ub|jects. They have very good rea&s;on, therefore to &s;ay, that the precept in their Alcoran, which en|joins obedience to the powers, is not very hard to follow, &s;ince they cannot help following it if they would; in as much as it is not to the mo&s;t virtu|ous that they are bound to &s;ubmit, but to the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tell you, that one of their kings hav|ing overcome and taken a prince that rebelled again&s;t him, and di&s;puted the crown with him, and upbraiding him with his treachery and perfidiou&s;|ne&s;s:&mdash;It has been decided but a moment, an|&s;wered the unfortunate prince, which of us two is the traitor.</P>

<HEAD>ON LOYALTY. FROM CATO'S LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NO good prince will pretend that there is any loyalty due to him further, than he him&s;elf is loyal to the law, and ob&s;ervant of his people, the makers of kings and of laws. If any man mi&s;|led by &s;ound and delu&s;ion, doubt this, let him con|&s;ider what is the de&s;ign of magi&s;tracy, and what the duty of magi&s;trates; and if he has rea&s;on in him, he will find that his duty is only due to tho&s;e who perform theirs. That protection and allegiance are reciprocal; that every man has a right to de|fend what no man has a right to take: That the di|vine right of kings, if they had it, can only warrant them in doing actions that are divine, and cannot protect them in cruelty, depredation and oppre&s;|&s;ion: That a divine right to act wickedly, is a con|tradiction and bla&s;phemy, as it is <HI>Maledictio Supremi Numinis,</HI> a reproach upon the Deity, as if he gave
<PB N="87" REF="88">any man a commi&s;&s;ion to be a devil: That a king in compari&s;on with the univer&s;e, is not &s;o much as a mayor of a town in compari&s;on of a kingdom; and that, were Mr. Mayor, called <HI>king,</HI> it would give him no new right; or, if a king were only called Mr. Mayor, it would not le&s;&s;on nor abro|gate his old juri&s;diction: That they are both civil officers, and that an offence in the le&s;&s;er is more pardonable than an offence in the greater. That the doctrines of unbroken hereditary right, and blind obedience, are the flights and forgeries of flatterers, who belie Heaven, and abu&s;e men, to make their own court to power, and that not one of them will &s;tand the trial him&s;elf; in fine, that government, hone&s;t and legal government, is <HI>im|perium legum non hominum,</HI> the authority of law, and not of lu&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principles upon which our go|vernment &s;tands, the principles upon which every free government mu&s;t &s;tand: and that we <HI>Britons,</HI> dare tell &s;uch truths, and publi&s;h &s;uch principles is a glorious proof of our civil and religious free|dom: They are truths which <HI>every Briton</HI> ought to know, even children and &s;ervants; They are eternal truths, that will remain for ever, though in too many countries they are dangerous or u&s;ele&s;s or little known.</P>
<P>Before I have done, I would take notice of another mi&s;take very common, concerning loyal|ty: It is indeed a trick more than a mi&s;take; I mean of tho&s;e who would a&s;&s;ert or rather create a &s;ort of LOYALTY TO MINISTERS, and make every thing which they do not like, an offence again&s;t their ma&s;ter.</P>

It follows that, among tho&s;e duties which men owe to each other, this ob|tains the &s;econd place, That every man e&s;teem and treat another, as naturally equal to him&s;elf, or as one who is a man as well as he:</P>
<P>Now this equality of mankind does not alone con&s;i&s;t in this, that men of ripe age have almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;trength, or if one be weaker, he may be able to kill the &s;tronger, either by treachery, or dex|terity, or by being better furni&s;hed with weapons: but in this, that though nature may have accom|pli&s;hed one man beyond another, with various endowments of body and mind: yet neverthele&s;s he is obliged to an ob&s;ervation of the precepts of the law-natural towards the meaner per&s;on, after the &s;ame manner as he him&s;elf expects the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on others; and has not therefore any greater li|berty given him to in&s;ult upon his fellows.

Not but that there are other popular rea&s;ons which illu&s;trate this equality; to wit, That we are all de&s;cended of the &s;ame &s;tock; that we are all born, nouri&s;hed, and die after the &s;ame manner; and, that God has not given any of us a certain a&s;&s;urance, that our happy condition in this world &s;hall not at one time or other be changed. Be&s;ides, the precepts of the Chri&s;tian religion tell us, that God favours not man for his nobility, power, or wealth, but for &s;incere piety, which may as well be found in a mean and humble man, as in tho&s;e of high degree.</P>
<P>Now from this equality it follows, That he who would u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others in promoting his own advantage, ought to be as free and ready to u&s;e his power and abilities for their &s;ervice, when they want his help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance on like occa&s;ions. For he who requires that other men &s;hould do him kindne&s;&s;es, and expects him&s;elf to be free from doing the like, mu&s;t be of opinion, that tho&s;e other men are below him&s;elf and not his equals. Hence as tho&s;e per&s;ons are the be&s;t members of a commu|nity, who, without any difficulty, allow the &s;ame things to their neighbours that them&s;elves require of him; &s;o tho&s;e are altogether incapable of &s;ocie|ty, who &s;etting a high rate on them&s;elves, in re|gard to others, will take upon them to act any thing towards their neighbour, and expect greater deference and more re&s;pect than the re&s;t of man|kind; and in their in&s;olent manner demanding a greater portion unto them&s;elves of tho&s;e things, to which, all men having a common right, they can in rea&s;on claim no larger &s;hare than other men: Whence this al&s;o is an univerfal duty of the law|natural, That no man, who has not a peculiar right ought to arrogate more to him&s;elf than he is ready to allow to his fellows, but that he permit other men to enjoy equal privileges with him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">The &s;ame e quality al&s;o &s;hews what every man's behaviour ought to be, when his bu&s;ine&s;s is to di&s;|tribute ju&s;tice among others; to wit, that he treat them as equals, and indulge not that, unle&s;s the merits of the cau&s;e require it, to one, which he dentes to another: For, if he do otherwi&s;e, he who is di&s;countenanced is, at the &s;ame time, affronted and wronged, and lo&s;es &s;omewhat of the dignity which nature be&s;towed upon him. Whence it follows, that things which are in common, are of right to be divided by equal parts among tho&s;e who are equal: Where the thing will not admit of di|vi&s;ion, they who are equally concerned, are to u&s;e it indifferently; and, if the quantity of the thing will bear it, as much as each party &s;hall think fit; But if this cannot be allowed, then it is to be u&s;ed after a &s;tated manner, and proportioned to the number of the claimants; becau&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible to find out any other way of ob&s;erving equality. But if it be a thing of that nature as not to be capable of being divided, nor of being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in common, then it mu&s;t be u&s;ed by turns; and if this yet will not an&s;wer the point, and it is not po&s;&s;ible the re&s;t &s;hould be &s;atisfied by an equi|valent. the be&s;t way mu&s;t be, to determine po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion by lot; for in &s;uch ca&s;es, no fitter method can be thought on, to remove all opinion of partiality and contempt of any party, without deba&s;ing the per&s;on whom fortune does not favour,</P>

<HEAD>ON THE ABSURDITY OF UNALTERA|BLE ESTABLISHMENTS. FROM PRIESTLY ON GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HIGHLY as we think of the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, we ju&s;tly think our&s;elves, of the pre&s;ent-age, wi&s;er, and, if we be not blinded by
<PB N="93" REF="94">the prejudice of education, mu&s;t &s;ee, that we can, in many re&s;pects, improve upon the in&s;titutions they have tran&s;mitted to us. Let us not doubt, but that every generation in po&s;terity will be as much &s;uperior to us in political, and in all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to im|prove upon the be&s;t civil in&s;titutions that we can pre&s;cribe for them. In&s;tead then of adding to the difficulties which we our&s;elves find, in making the improvements we wi&s;h to introduce, let us make this great and de&s;ireable work ea&s;ier to them than it has been to us.</P>
<P>However, &s;uch is the progre&s;s of knowledge, and the enlargement of the human mind, that, in future time, notwith&s;tanding all ob&s;tructions thrown in the way of human genius, men of great and exalted views will undoubtedly ari&s;e, who will &s;ee through, and dete&s;t our narrow politics; when the ill-advi&s;ers, and ill-advi&s;ed authous of the&s;e illiberal and contracted &s;chemes, will be re|membered with infamy and execration: When notwith&s;tanding their talents as &s;tate&s;men or wri|ters, and though they may have pur&s;ued the &s;ame mind en&s;laving &s;chemes by more artful and le&s;s &s;anguinary methods, they will be ranked among the Bonners and Gardeners of pa&s;t ages; they mu&s;t have been wor&s;e than Bonners and Garden|ers, who could pur&s;ue the &s;ame ends by the &s;ame means, in this more humane and more enlighten|ed age.</P>
<P>England hath hitherto taken the lead, in almo&s;t every thing, great and good, and her citizens &s;tand foremo&s;t in the annals of fame, as having &s;haken off the fetters which hung upon the human mind, and called it forth to the exertion of its noble&s;t powers. And her con&s;titution has been &s;o far from receiving any injury from the efforts of the&s;e her free-born enterpri&s;ing &s;ons, that &s;he is in part, indebted to them for the unrivalled repu|tation
<PB N="94" REF="95">&s;he now enjoys, of having the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of policy in Europe. After weathering &s;o many real &s;torms, let us not quit the helm at the appre|hen&s;ion of imaginary dangers, but &s;teadily hold on in what, I tru&s;t, is the mo&s;t glorious cour&s;e that a government can be in. Let all the friends of li|berty and human nature join to free the minds of men from the &s;hackles of narrow and impolitic laws. Let us be free our&s;elves, and leave the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom to our po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it &s;eems to have been the intention of Divine Providence, that mankind &s;hould be, as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;elf-taught; that we &s;hould attain to every thing excellent and u&s;eful, as the re&s;ult of our own experience and ob&s;ervation; that our judgment &s;hould be formed by the appearances which, are pre&s;ented to them, and our hearts in|&s;tructed by their own feelings. But by the unna|tural &s;y&s;tem of rigid, unalterable e&s;tabli&s;hments, we put it out of our power to in&s;truct our&s;elves, or to derive any advantage from the lights we ac|quire from experience and ob&s;ervation; and there|by, as far as in our power, we counteract the kind intentions of the Deity in the con&s;titution of the world, and in providing for a &s;tate of con&s;tant, though &s;low improvement in every thing.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the fetters we can lay upon the human mind, notwith&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible di&s;cou|ragements in the way of free enquiry, knowledge of all kinds will encrea&s;e. The wi&s;dom of one generation will be folly in the next. And that, though we have &s;een this verified in the hi&s;tory of near two thou&s;and years, we per&s;i&s;t in the ab&s;urd maxim of making a preceding generation dictate to a &s;ucceeding one, which is the &s;ame thing as making the fooli&s;h in&s;truct the wi&s;e; for what is a lower degree of wi&s;dom but comparatively folly?</P>
<P>Were any more laws re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s in force, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far
<PB N="95" REF="96">they might be con&s;trued to extend. Tho&s;e already in being are more than are requi&s;ite, and incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the intere&s;ts of truth. Were they to ex|tend further, every author would lie at the mercy of the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who might condemn, in|di&s;criminately, upon &s;ome pretence or other, every work that gave them umbrage; under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances; might fall &s;ome of the greate&s;t and noble&s;t productions of the human mind, if &s;uch works could be produced in tho&s;e circum&s;tances. For, if men of genius knew they could not pub|li&s;h the di&s;coveries they made, they would not give free &s;cope to their faculties, in making and pur&s;uing tho&s;e di&s;coveries. It is the thought of publication, and the pro&s;pect of fame, which is generally the great incentive to men of genius to exert their faculties, in attempting the untrodden paths of &s;peculation. In tho&s;e unhappy circum|&s;tances, writers would entertain a dread of every new &s;ubject. No man could &s;afely indulge him|&s;elf in any thing bold, enterpri&s;ing, and out of the vulgar road; and in all publications we &s;hould &s;ee a timidity incompatable with the &s;pirit of di&s;co|very. If any towering genius &s;hould ari&s;e in tho&s;e unfavourable circum&s;tances, a Newton in the na|tural world; or a Locke, a Hutchin&s;on, a Clarke, or a Harley in the moral, the only effectual method to prevent their defu&s;ing a &s;pirit of enterprize or innovation, which is natural to &s;uch great &s;ouls, could be no other than that which Tarquin &s;o &s;ig|nificantly expre&s;&s;ed, by taking off the heads of all tho&s;e poppies which overlooked the re&s;t. Such men could not but be dangerous, and give umbrage in a country, where it was the maxim of the go|vernment, that every thing of importance &s;hould for ever remain unalterably fixed.</P>

<P>While the civil and religious parts of a common|wealth are in forming, there is a nece&s;&s;ity that &s;he &s;hould be &s;upported by an army; but when the military and provincial parts are rightly formed, &s;he can have no farther u&s;e of any other army.

<P>The rea&s;on why the nations that have common|wealths u&s;e them &s;o well, and cheri&s;h them &s;o much, and yet that &s;o few nations have common|wealths, is, that in u&s;ing a commonwealth it is not nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be under&s;tood; but in mak|ing a commonwealth, that it be under&s;tood is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a moment like the pre&s;ent, when wilful mi&s;repre&s;entations are indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread by the partizans of arbitrary power, and the advocates of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and Court-Government; we think it incumbent upon us to declare to the world our principles, and the motives of our conduct.</P>
<P>We rejoice at the glorious event of the <HI>French Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked&mdash;What is the French Revolution to us?</P>
<P>We an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>It is much.</HI> Much to us as men: Much to us as Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>As men, we rejoice in the freedom of twenty-five millions of our fellow men. We rejoice in the pro&s;pect, which &s;uch a magnificent example opens to the world. We congratulate the French nation for having laid the axe to the root of tyranny, and for erecting Government on the &s;acred HEREDI|TARY Rights of MAN.&mdash;Rights which appertain to ALL, and not to any one more than to another.&mdash;We know of no human authority, &s;uperior to that of a whole nation; and we profe&s;s and proclaim it as our principle, that every nation has at all times, an inherent, indefea&s;ible right to con&s;titute and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Government for it&s;elf as be&s;t ac|cords with its di&s;po&s;ition, intere&s;t and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As Engli&s;hmen, we al&s;o rejoice, becau&s;e we are <HI>immediately</HI> intere&s;ted in the French Revolution.</P>
<P>Without enquiring into the ju&s;tice, on either &s;ide of the reproachful charges of intrigue and am|bition,
<PB N="99" REF="100">which the Engli&s;h and French courts have con&s;tantly made on each other, we confine our|&s;elves to this ob&s;ervation;&mdash;That if the Court of France only was in fault, and the numerous wars which have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed both countries are chargea|ble to her alone, that Court now exi&s;ts no longer; and the cau&s;e and the con&s;equence mu&s;t now cea&s;e together. The French therefore, by the Revolu|tion they have made, have conquered for us as well as for them&s;elves; if it be true, that their Court only was in fault and ours never.</P>
<P>On this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the French Revolution concerns us <HI>immediately.</HI> We are oppre&s;&s;ed with a heavy National debt, a burthen of taxes, and an expen&s;ive admini&s;tration of Government; beyond tho&s;e of any people in the world. We have al&s;o a very numerous poor; and we hold, that the moral obligation of providing for old age, helple&s;s infan|cy and poverty, is far &s;uperior to that of &s;upply|ing the invented wants of courtly extravagance, ambition and intrigue.</P>
<P>We believe there is no in&s;tance to be produced, but in England, of <HI>&s;even</HI> millions of inhabitants, which make but little more than <HI>one</HI> million of fa|milies, paying yearly SEVENTEEN MILLIONS of taxes.</P>
<P>As it has always been held out by all admini&s;|trations, that the re&s;tle&s;s ambition of the Court of France rendered this expence nece&s;&s;ary to us for our own defence; we con&s;equently rejoice as men deeply intere&s;ted in the French Revolution; for that Court as we have already &s;aid exi&s;ts no longer and con&s;equently the &s;ame enormous expences need not continue to us.</P>
<P>Thus rejoicing, as we &s;incerely do, both as men and Engli&s;hmen, as lovers of univer&s;al peace and freedom, and as friends to our national pro&s;perity and a reduction of our public expences; we can|not but expre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment, that any part, or
<PB N="100" REF="101">any members of our own government, &s;hould re|probate the extinction of that very power in France or wi&s;h to &s;ee it re&s;tored, to who&s;e influence they formerly attributed (whil&s;t they appeared to la|ment) the enormous increa&s;e of our own burthens and taxes. What then, Are they &s;orry that the pretence for new oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, and the occa&s;ion for continuing many old taxes, will be at an end? &mdash;If &s;o, and if it is the policy of Courts and Court Government to prefer enemies to friends, and a &s;y&s;tem of war to that of peace, as affording more pretences for Places, Offices, Pen&s;ions, Revenue and Taxation, it is high time for the people of every nation to look with circum&s;pection to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who pay the expence, and, not tho&s;e who <HI>participate</HI> in the emoluments ari&s;ing from it, are the per&s;ons immediately intere&s;ted in enquiries of this kind. We are a part of that National body, on whom this annual expence of &s;eventeen millions falls; and we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent opportunity of the French Revolution, as a mo&s;t happy one for le&s;|&s;ening the enormous load, under which this nation groans. If this be not done, we &s;hall then have rea&s;on to conclude, that the cry of intrigue and ambition again&s;t <HI>other</HI> Courts is no more than the common cant of <HI>all</HI> Courts.</P>
<P>We think it al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s our a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that a Government de&s;irous of being called FREE, &s;hould prefer connections with the mo&s;t de&s;potic and arbitrary powers in Europe.&mdash; We know of none more de&s;erving this de&s;cription than tho&s;e of Turkey and Pru&s;&s;ia, and the whole combination of German de&s;pots.&mdash;Separated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the con|tinent we reprobate all &s;y&s;tems and intrigues which &s;acrifice (and that too at a great expence) the ble&s;|&s;ings of our natural &s;ituation.&mdash;Such &s;y&s;tems can|not have a national origin.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">If we are a&s;ked, What Government is?&mdash;We hold it to be nothing more than <HI>a National A&s;&s;ociation</HI> end we hold that to be the be&s;t, which &s;ecures to every man his rights, and promotes the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s with the <HI>lea&s;t expence.</HI></P>
<P>We live to improve, or we live in vain; and therefore we admit of no maxims of government or policy, on the mere &s;core of antiquity, or other men's authority, the <HI>Old Whigs or the New.</HI></P>
<P>We will exerci&s;e the rea&s;on with which we are endowed, or we po&s;&s;e&s;s it unworthily. As rea&s;on is given at all times, it is for the purpo&s;e of being u&s;ed at all times.</P>
<P>Among the ble&s;&s;ings which the French Revolu|tion has produced to that nation, we enumerate the abolition of the feudal &s;y&s;tem of inju&s;tice and tyranny, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1789. Beneath the feudal &s;y&s;tem all Europe has long groaned, and from it England is not yet free. Game laws, bo|rough-tenures and tyrannical monopolies of nu|merous kinds &s;till remain among&s;t us: but rejoic|ing as we &s;incerely do, in the freedom of others, till we &s;hall happily accompli&s;h our own, we intend|ed to commemorate this prelude to the univer&s;al extirpation of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, by meeting on the anniver&s;ary of that day, (the 4th. of Augu&s;t) at the Crown and Anchor. From this meeting we were prevented by the interference of certain <HI>un|named</HI> and <HI>&s;culking</HI> per&s;ons with the Ma&s;ter of the Tavern, who informed us that on <HI>their</HI> repre&s;en|tations he could not receive us.&mdash;Let tho&s;e who live by, or countenance feudal oppre&s;&s;ions, take the reproach of this ineffectual meanne&s;s and cow|ardice to them&s;elves. They connot &s;tifle the pub|lic declaration of our hone&s;t, open, and avowed opinions.</P>
<P>The&s;e are our principles, and the&s;e our &s;enti|ments. They embrace the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the great body of the nation of which we are a
<PB N="102" REF="103">part. As to riots and tumults, let tho&s;e an&s;wer for them, who by wilful mi&s;repre&s;entations en|deavour to excite and promote them; or, who feek to <HI>&s;tun</HI> the &s;en&s;e of the nation, and lo&s;e the great cau&s;e of public good, in the outrages of a mi&s;informed mob. We take our ground on prin|ciples that require no &s;uch riotous aid. We have nothing to apprehend from the poor; for we are pleading their cau&s;e. And we fear not proud oppre&s;&s;ion; for we have truth on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>We &s;ay, and we repeat it; that the French Re|volution opens to the world an opportunity, in which all good citizens mu&s;t rejoice: that of pro|moting the general happine&s;s of man. And that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, moreover, offers to this country in particular an opportunity of reducing our enormous taxes.</P>

Their &s;ituation upon the continent, the power of their former ma&s;ters, and the ambition of their neighbours, obliged them to keep great bodies of troops. The&s;e two articles, added to the numbers of the community, without either enriching the &s;tate by their labour exported, or producing food for them&s;elves or countrymen.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of a commonwealth was calculated, to draw together the indu&s;trious; but it has been &s;till more u&s;eful in &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them; the republi|can form of government being there greatly &s;ub|divided, ve&s;ts authority &s;ufficient in every part of
<PB N="104" REF="105">it, to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion for their own &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and the tie which unites them, regards only matters of public concern. Had the whole been governed by one &s;overeign, or by one coun|cil, this important matter never could have been effectuated.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t able mini&s;|ter that ever lived, to provide nouri&s;hment for a country &s;o exten&s;ive as France, or even as En|gland, &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e as fully peopled as Holland is: even though it &s;hould be admitted, that a &s;uf|ficient quantity of food might be found in other countries for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The enterprize would be too great, abu&s;es would multiply; the con&s;equence would be, that the inhabitants would die for want. But in Holland the ca&s;e is different; every little town takes care of its own inhabi|tants; and this care being the object of applica|tion and profit to &s;o many per&s;ons, is accompli&s;h|ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Le&s;&s;on III.</HI>&mdash;From Lady Montague's Letters.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve the difference be|tween the free towns, and tho&s;e under the go|vernment of ab&s;olute princes, as all the little &s;overeigns of Germany are. In the fir&s;t there ap|pears an air of commerce and plenty: The &s;treets are well built, and full of people neatly and plainly dre&s;&s;ed. The &s;hops are loaded with mer|chandize, and the commonality are clean and chear|ful. In the other you &s;ee a fort of &s;habby finery, a number of dirty people of quality tawdred out: narrow na&s;ty &s;treets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common &s;ort a&s;king alms. I cannot help fancying one under the figure of a clean Dutch Citizen's wife; and the other like a poor town lady of plea&s;ure, painted and ribboned out in her head dre&s;s, with tarni&s;hed &s;ilver-laced &s;hoes, a ragged under-petticoat, a mi&s;e|rable mixture of vice and poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">We take care to make &s;uch &s;hort &s;tages every day, that I rather fancy my&s;elf upon parties of plea&s;ure, than upon the road; and &s;ure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large garden, the roads are all paved&punc; &s;haded on each &s;ide with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing. Every twenty paces gives you the pro&s;pect of &s;ome villa, and every four hours that of a large town, &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly neat, I am &s;ure you would be charmed with them.</P>
<P>My arrival at Rotterdam&punc; pre&s;ented me a new &s;cene of plea&s;ure. All the &s;treets are paved with broad &s;tones, and before many of the meane&s;t arti|ficer's doors, are placed &s;eats of various coloured marbles, &s;o neatly kept, that I a&s;&s;ure you, I walk|ed almo&s;t all over the town ye&s;terday, incognito, in my &s;lippers, without one &s;pot of dirt; and you may &s;ee the Dutch maids wa&s;hing the pavement of the &s;treet with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town &s;eems &s;o full of people, with &s;uch bu&s;y faces, and all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not &s;ome celebrated fair; but I &s;ee it every day the &s;ame. It is certain no town can be more advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for commerce. Here are &s;even large canals, on which the mer|chants' &s;hips come up to the very doors of their hou&s;es. The &s;hops and warehou&s;es are of a very &s;urprizing neatne&s;s and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandize, and &s;o much cheaper than what we &s;ee in England, that I have much ado to per&s;uade my&s;elf I am &s;till &s;o near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be &s;een. One is not &s;hocked with tho&s;e loath&s;ome cripples, &s;o common in London, nor teazed with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that chu&s;e to be na&s;ty and lazy. The common &s;ervants and little &s;hop-women here, are more nicely clean, than mo&s;t of our ladies; and the great variety of

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GENEVA BY D'ALEMBERT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very remarkable, that a city, which con|tains &s;carce 24000 inhabitants, and who&s;e &s;cat|tered territory con&s;i&s;ts not of thirty villages, &s;hould be a &s;overeign &s;tate, and one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities of Europe; enriched by her li|berty and her commerce, &s;he frequently beholds every thing around her in flames, without having any &s;hare in the calamity. The events which di&s;turb the re&s;t of Europe, afford her only an amn&s;ing &s;pectacle, which &s;he ob&s;erves without tak|ing any part in them. Attached to France, by treaties and by commerce, to England by com|merce and religion, &s;he is too prudent to intere&s;t her&s;elf in the wars that embroil the&s;e two power|ful nations; &s;he pronounces with impartiality upon the ju&s;tice of their conte&s;ts, and judges all the &s;o|vereigns of Europe, without flattering, injuring, or fearing them.</P>
<P>The city is well fortified, particularly on the &s;ide of that prince from whom it has mo&s;t to fear, the King of Sardinia. On the &s;ide of France it is almo&s;t open and defencele&s;s; but di&s;cipline is kept up as in a military place, the ar&s;enals and maga|zines well furni&s;hed, every citizen is a &s;oldier, as in Switzerland, and ancient Rome; the Genevois are allowed to go into foreign &s;ervice, but the re|public does not furni&s;h any &s;tate with regular bo|dies of men, nor does it &s;uffer an inrolment with|in its own territories.</P>
<P>Though the individuals are rich, the government is poor, from that aver&s;ion which the people &s;hew to new taxes, how little burden&s;ome &s;oever. The revenues of the &s;tate do not amount to 500,000
<PB N="107" REF="108">livres of French money; and yet, by the admirable oeconomy with which they are managed. they are &s;ufficient, and even afford a &s;urplus for extraor|dinary emergencies.</P>
<P>Hereditary dignity is unknown at Geneva; the &s;ons of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate are lo&s;t in the crowd, till their own merit di&s;tingui&s;hes them; nobility and riches confer neither rank nor privilege, nor give any facility of advancement to the offices of the &s;tate. All &s;olicitation for places is &s;trictly prohi|bited; &mdash;Public employments are &s;o little lucrative, that they afford no temptations for the avaricious; they are objects only to nobler minds, by the con|&s;ideration and re&s;pect they procure.</P>
<P>Few di&s;putes come to a legal trial; they are ge|nerally adjusted by common friends, by the advo|cates them&s;elves and by the judges.</P>
<P>Their &s;umptuary laws forbid the u&s;e of jewels and embroidery, limit the expence of funerals, and oblige all the citizens to walk on foot in the &s;treets, carriages being allowed only in the country.&mdash; The&s;e laws, which are regarded in France as too &s;e|vere, nay, almo&s;t barbarous and inhuman, by no means abridge the real conveniences of life, which are always to be obtained at little expence; they retrench only the pageantry of it, which contri|butes not to happine&s;s, and often produces ruin, without any advantage.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no where &s;o many happy marriages: Geneva has, in this re&s;pect, the &s;tart of our manners at lea&s;t two centuries.&mdash;The re|&s;traints upon luxury remove the fear of a multi|tude of children; and, by this means, luxury is not as in France, one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles to population.</P>
<P>Geneva has an univer&s;ity, which they call an academy, where youth are educated without ex|pence: The profe&s;&s;ors are eligible to offices of &s;tate&mdash;Many of them have become magi&s;trates, and this privilege contributes much to keep up the emulation and &s;ame of the academy.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="109">Their public library is a well cho&s;en collection of books, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and vo|lumes, and a great number of manu&s;cripts. The books are lent to all the citizens, every one reads, and informs him&s;elf: and by this means, the peo|ple of Geneva are better in&s;tructed than any where el&s;e. They find none of tho&s;e inconveniencies which we &s;uppo&s;e would follow the &s;ame indul|gence among us; perhaps the Genevois and our politicians may be both in the right.</P>
<P>All the &s;ciences, and mo&s;t of the arts, have been cultivated with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s at Geneva, that it is &s;urprizing to &s;ee the li&s;t of learned men and ar|ti&s;ts of every kind, which this city has produced within the la&s;t two ages&mdash;It has even had the good fortune &s;ometimes to be the re&s;idence of celebrated &s;trangers, whom its agreable &s;ituation, and the liberty it enjoys, have invited to retire thither. M. de Voltaire, who has re&s;ided there for the la&s;t &s;even years, finds, among the&s;e republicans, the &s;ame marks of e&s;teem and con&s;ideration which he has received from &s;o many monarchs.</P>
<P>The eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;tical con&s;titution of Geneva is pure Pre&s;byteriani&s;m; no bi&s;hops nor canons;&mdash;Not that they di&s;approve of epi&s;copacy, but as they have no faith in the divine right of bi&s;hops, they think Pa&s;|tors, not quite &s;o rich and important as bi&s;hops, agree better with a &s;mall republic.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters are either pa&s;tors, like our pari&s;h prie&s;ts, or po&s;tulans as our prie&s;ts without bene|fice. The revenue of the pa&s;tors does not amount to above 1200 livres, without any ca&s;ual profits: The state makes this allowance.&mdash;The church has nothing.</P>

<P>In England, the people at large are as perfectly ignorant of the acts of Parliament, after they are made, as they po&s;&s;ibly can be before. They are printed by one man only, who is called the king's printer&mdash;in the old German character, which few men can read&mdash;and &s;old at a price that few can afford to pay. But, le&s;t &s;ome &s;craps or comments upon them &s;hould come to the people, through the medium of public news-papers, every &s;uch paper is &s;tamped with a heavy duty: and an act of parlia|ment is made, to prevent men from lending their papers to each other; &s;o that, not one per&s;on in a hundred &s;ees a news-paper once in a year. If a man at the bottom of York&s;hire di&s;covers, by in|&s;tinct, that a law is made which is intere&s;ting for him to know, he has only to make a journey to London, find out the king's printer, pay a penny a page for the law, and learn the German alphabet.

<PB N="116" REF="117">wings, and be apt to bate, yet tho&s;e in land are the mo&s;t hooded and tied to the perch, whereas tho&s;e in money have the lea&s;t hold, and are the &s;wifte&s;t in flight. A bank, where the money takes not wing, but to come home &s;eized, or like a coy duck, may well be great; but the trea&s;ure of the <HI>Indies</HI> going out, and not upon returns, makes no bank. Whence a bank never paid an army; or paying an army &s;oon became no bank. But where a prince or nobility has an e&s;tate in land, the revenue whereof will defray this charge, there their men are plant|ed, have toes that are roots, and arms that bring forth what fruit you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus a &s;ingle per&s;on is made, or a nobility makes a king, not with difficulty or any great pru|dence, but with ea&s;e, the re&s;t coming home, as the <HI>ox that not only knows his master's crib,</HI> but mu&s;t &s;tarve or repair to it. Nor for the &s;ame rea&s;on is government acquired with more ea&s;e than it is pre|&s;erved; that is, if the foundation of property be in land. but if in morey, <HI>lightly come, lightly go.</HI> The rea&s;on why a &s;ingle per&s;on, or the nobility that has one hundred thou&s;and men, or half &s;o many at command, will have the government, is, that the e&s;tate in land, whereby they are able to maintain &s;o many, in any <HI>European</HI> territory, mu&s;t overbalance the re&s;t that remains to the people, at lea&s;t three parts in four, by which means they are no more able to di&s;pute the government with him or them, than your &s;ervant is with you. Now, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if the people hold three parts in four of the territory, it is plain there can nei|ther be any &s;ingle per&s;on nor nobility able to di&s;|pute the government with them; in this ca&s;e, therefore, except force be interpo&s;ed, they govern them&s;elves. So by this computation of the balance of property, or dominion in land, you have ac|cording to the threefold foundation of property, the root or generation of the threefold kind of go|vernment or empire.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">If one man be &s;ole landlord of a territory, or overbalance the whole people, three parts in four, or thereabouts, he is Grand Seignior; for &s;o the Turk, not from his empire, but his property, is called; and the empire in this ca&s;e, is ab&s;olute monarchy.</P>
<P>If the few, or a nobility, or a nobility with a clergy, be landlords to &s;uch a proportion as over|balances the people in the like manner, they may make whom they plea&s;e king; or, if they be not plea&s;ed with their king, down with him, and &s;et up whom they like better; a HENRY the Fourth, or the Seventh, a GUISE, a MONTFORT, a NEVIL, or a PORTER, &s;hould they find that be&s;t for their own ends and purpo&s;es: For, as not the balance of the king, but that of the nobility, in this ca&s;e, is the cau&s;e of the government, &s;o not the e&s;tate or the riches of the prince or captain, but his virtue or ability, or fitne&s;s for the ends of the nobility, acquires that command or office. This for ari&s;to|cracy or mixed monarchy. But if the whole people be landlords, or hold the land &s;o divided among them, that no one man or number of men within the compa&s;s of the few, or ari&s;tocracy over|balance them, it is a commonwealth. Such is the branch in the root, or the balance of property na|turally producing empire; which not confuted, no man &s;hall be able to batter my &s;uper&s;tructures, and which confuted I lay down my arms; till then, if the cau&s;e nece&s;&s;arily precede the effect, property mu&s;t have a being before empire; or, beginning with it, mu&s;t be &s;till fir&s;t in order.</P>
<P>Property comes to have a being before empire or government two ways, either by a natural or violent revolution. Natural revolution happens from within, or by commerce, as when a govern|ment erected upon one balance, that for example of a nobility or a clergy, through the decay of their e&s;tates comes to alter to another balance; which
<PB N="118" REF="119">alteration in the root of property leaves all to con|fu&s;ion, or produces a new branch of government, according to the kind or nature of the root. Vio|lent revolution happens from without, or by arms, as when upon conque&s;t there follows confi&s;cation. Confi&s;cation again is of three kinds; when the captain taking all to him&s;elf, plants his army, by way of military colonies, benefices, or timars, which was the policy of MAHOMET; or when the captain has &s;ome &s;harers, or a nobility that divides with him which was the policy introduced by the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals;</HI> or when the captain divides the inheritance by lots, or otherwi&s;e, to the whole people; which policy was in&s;tituted by GOD or MOSES in the commonwealth of I&s;rael. This tri|ple di&s;tribution, which from natural or violent re|volution returns as to the generation of empire to the &s;ame thing, that is to the nature of the balance already &s;tated and demon&s;trated.</P>

<HEAD>ABRIDGMENT OF ROMAN HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>ROMULUS and REMUS being &s;ent by their grandfather Numetor, from Alba, at the head of a colony, to &s;eek a new &s;ettlement, quarrelled about the choice of a &s;pot where they &s;hould fix, and build them a city: Romulus chu&s;ing mount Palatine, and Remus mount Aventine. Remus is &s;aid to have lo&s;t his life in this di&s;pute. The city was therefore built on mount Palatine, and, in compliment to its founder, called Rome. As Romulus had not taken upon him the chief com|mand of the colony for any longer time than while the city was building, he, as &s;oon as the work was fini&s;hed, &s;ubmitted the form of its future go|vernment to the choice of the people, and, calling the citizens together, harangued them in words to this effect:</P>
<P>"If all the &s;trength of cities lay in the height of their ramparts, or the depth of their ditches,
<PB N="119" REF="120">we &s;hould have great rea&s;on to be in fear for that which we have now built. Are there in reality any walls too high to be &s;caled by a valiant ene|my? And of what u&s;e are ramparts in inte&s;tine divi&s;ions? They may &s;erve for a defence again&s;t &s;udden incur&s;ions from abroad; but it is by cou|rage and prudence chiefly, that the inva&s;ions of foreign enemies are repelled: and by unanimity, &s;obriety, and ju&s;tice, that dome&s;tic &s;editions are prevented. Cities fortified by the &s;tronge&s;t bul|warks have been &s;een to yield to force from with|out, or to tumults from within. An exact mi|litary di&s;cipline, and a &s;teady ob&s;ervance of civil policy, are the &s;ure&s;t barriers again&s;t the&s;e evils. But there is &s;till another point of great importance to be con&s;idered: the pro&s;perity of &s;ome ri&s;ing colonies, and the &s;peedy ruin of others, have in a great mea&s;ure been owing to their form of go|vernment. Was there but one manner of ruling &s;tates and cities that could make them happy, the choice would not be difficult. But I have learnt, that of the various forms of government among the Greeks and Barbarians, there are three which are highly extolled by tho&s;e who have experi|enced them; and yet, that no one of the&s;e is in all re&s;pects perfect, but each of them has &s;ome innate and incurable defect. Chu&s;e ye, then, in what manner this city &s;hall be governed. Shall it be by one man? Shall it be by a &s;elect number of the wi&s;e&s;t among us? or &s;hall the legi&s;lative power be in the people? As for me, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to any form of admin&s;tration you &s;hall plea&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. As I think my&s;elf not unworthy to command, &s;o neither am I unwilling to obey. Your having cho&s;en me to be the leader of this colony, and your calling the city after my name, are honours &s;ufficient te content me; honours, of which, liv|ing or dead, I can never be deprived."</P>
<P>Romulus was cho&s;en king; and Rome was go|verned by kings for upwards of 240 years, till the
<PB N="120" REF="121">expul&s;ion of Tarquin the Second, which was occa|&s;ioned by his &s;on Sextus ravi&s;hing Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, a noble Roman. Lucretia, up|on receiving this injury, &s;ent for her hu&s;band, who was then in the camp at Ardea with Tarquin, and for &s;everal of his friends, and having informed them of the outrage &s;he had received, and engaged them to revenge it, &s;tabbed her&s;elf to the heart, and died before them. The Romans had long groaned under the tyranny and cruelty of the Tarquins, and were therefore glad to lay hold on &s;o flagrant and outrageous an in&s;ult, to &s;hake off their yoke. The famous Junius Brutus, who for &s;ome rea&s;ons had ma&s;ked him&s;elf, and concealed great talents, under the appearance of idioti&s;m, &s;uddenly threw off his di&s;gui&s;e, and, going near to the dying lady, drew the poignard out of her bo&s;om, and &s;hewing it all bloody to the a&s;&s;embly, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment thus addre&s;&s;ed them:</P>
<P>"Yes, noble lady, I &s;wear by this blood, which was once &s;o pure, and which nothing but royal villainy could have polluted, that I will pur&s;ue Lucius Tarquinius the Proud, his wicked wife, and their children, with fire and &s;word, nor will I ever &s;uffer any of that family, or of any other whatever, to be king in Rome: Ye Gods, I call you to witne&s;s this my oath!&mdash;There, Romans, turn your eyes to that &s;ad &s;pectacle&mdash;the daughter of Lucretius, Collatinus's wife&mdash;&s;he died by her own hand. See there a noble lady, whom the lu&s;t of a Tarquin reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of being her own executioner, to atte&s;t her innocence. Ho&s;|pitably entertained by her as a kin&s;man of her hu&s;|band's, Sextus, the perfidious gue&s;t, became her brutal ravi&s;her. The cha&s;te, the generous Lucretia could not &s;urvive the in&s;ult. Glorious woman! But once only treated as a &s;lave, &s;he thought life no longer to be endured. Lucretia, a woman, di&s;dained a life that depended upon a tyrant's will;
<PB N="121" REF="122">and &s;hall we, &s;hall men, with &s;uch an example before our eyes, and after five-and-twenty years of igno|minous &s;ervitude, &s;hall we, through a fear of dying, defer one &s;ingle in&s;tant to a&s;&s;ert our liberty? No, Romans, now is the time; the favourable moment we have &s;o long waited for is come. Tarquin is not at Rome. The patricians are at the head of the enter|prize. The city is abundantly provided with men, arms, and all things nece&s;&s;ary. There is nothing want|ing to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s, if our own courage does not fail us. And &s;hall tho&s;e warriors, who have ever been &s;o brave, when foreign enemies were to be &s;ubdued, or when conque&s;ts were to be made to gratify the ambition and avarice of Tarquin, be then only cow|ards, when they are to deliver them&s;elves from &s;la|very? Some of you, perhaps, are intimidated by the army which Tarquin now commands. The &s;oldiers, you imagine will take the part of their general: Bani&s;h &s;o groundle&s;s a fear. The love of liberty is natural to all men. Your fellow citizens in the camp feel the weight of oppre&s;&s;ion, with as quick a &s;en&s;e, as you that are in Rome. They will as eagerly &s;eize the occa&s;ion of throwing of the yoke. But, let us grant there may be &s;ome among them who through ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit, or a bad education, will be di&s;|po&s;ed to favour the tyrant. The number of the&s;e can be but &s;mall, and we have means &s;ufficient in our hands to reduce them to rea&s;on. They left us ho&s;|tages more dear to them than life. Their wives, their children, their fathers, their mothers are in the city. Courage, Romans, the gods are for us! tho&s;e Gods, who&s;e temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned by &s;acrifices and libations made with pol|luted hands, polluted with blood, and with num|berle&s;s unexpiated crimes committed again&s;t his &s;ub|jects. Ye Gods, who protected our forefathers! ye Genii, who watch for the pre&s;ervation and glory of Rome! do you in&s;pire us with courage and unani|mity
<PB N="122" REF="123">in this glorious cau&s;e, and we will, to our la&s;t breath, defend your wor&s;hip from all profanation."</P>

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>There are in the&s;e I&s;lands an unfortunate and numerous cla&s;s of men, known under the name of <HI>Scallags.</HI></P>

<PB N="123" REF="124">or a laird. The Scallag builds his own hut, with &s;ods and boughs of trees, and if he is &s;ent from one part of the country to another, he moves off his &s;ticks; and, by means of the&s;e, forms a new hut in another place. He is, however, in mo&s;t places, en|couraged by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the walls of a former but, which he covers in the be&s;t way be can with his old &s;ticks, &s;tubble, and fern. Five days in the week he works for his ma&s;ter; the &s;ixth is allowed to him&s;elf, for the cultivation of &s;ome &s;crap of land, on the edge of &s;ome mo&s;s or moor; on which he rai&s;es a little kail or colewort, barley and potatoes. The&s;e articles boiled up in one ma&s;h, and often without &s;alt, are his only food; except in tho&s;e &s;ea|&s;ons and days when he can catch &s;ome fi&s;h, which he is al&s;o obliged not unfrequently to eat without bread or &s;alt. The only bread he ta&s;tes is a cake, made of the flower of barley. He is allowed coar&s;e &s;hoes, with tartan ho&s;e, and a coar&s;e coat, with a blanket or two for cloathing. It may occur to an Engli&s;h reader, that, as the Scallag works only five days out of &s;even for his ma&s;ter, he has two to pro|vide for him&s;elf. But it is to be recollected, that throughout the whole of Scotland, and all its ap|pendages, Sunday, or the &s;abbath as it is called, is celebrated by a total ce&s;&s;ation from all labour, and all amu&s;ements, as well as by religious exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The tack&s;men and &s;ubtenants, formerly on an equal footing, or nearly &s;o, were wont to plead their cau&s;e on equal terms before a common chief. At pre&s;ent they are obliged to be much more &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to their tack&s;man than ever they were in former times to their lairds or lords. Formerly they were a free, animated, and bold people, command|ing re&s;pect for their undanted courage, and repell|ing injuries from whatever quarter they came, both by words and actions.

What degree of &s;pirit and virtue is to be expected, from a people &s;o humbled, &s;o en|&s;taved? What degree of courage, or even inclinati|tion to repel an invading enemy? <Q>If we have not money</Q> (&s;ome of the&s;e tack&s;men have been known to &s;ay,) <Q>we have men enough: let us wear them well while they are in our power.</Q> In &s;hort they treat them like bea&s;ts of burthen; and in all re&s;pects like &s;laves attached to the &s;oil, as they cannot ob|tain new habitations, on account of combinations among the tack&s;men, and are entirely at the mercy of the laird or tack&s;man.</P>

<HEAD>A GOVERNMENT OF CITIZENS IS INVULNERABLE. FROM HARRINCTON'S OCEANA.</HEAD>
<P>ALL government, as implied by what has been already &s;hewn, is of the&s;e three kinds: <HI>A go|vernment of &s;ervants: A government of &s;ubjects; or A government of citizens.</HI> The fir&s;t is ab&s;olute monar|chy, as that of <HI>Turkey:</HI> The &s;econd ari&s;tocratical monarchy, as that of <HI>France:</HI> The third a common|wealth, as tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Holland.</HI> Now to follow MACHIAVEL (in part) of the&s;e, the government of &s;ervants is the harder to be con|quered, and the ea&s;ier to be held: The government of &s;ubjects is the ea&s;ter to be conquered and the harder to be held. To which I &s;hall pre&s;ume to add, that the government of citizens is both the harde&s;t to be conquered, and the harde&s;t to be held.</P>
<P>My author's rea&s;ons, why a government of &s;er|vants is the harde&s;t to be conquered, come to this, that they are under perpetual di&s;cipline and com|mand, void of &s;uch intere&s;ts and factions as have hands or power to hold upon advantages or innova|tion; whence he that invades the <HI>Turk</HI> mu&s;t tru&s;t to his own &s;trength, and not rely upon di&s;orders in the government, or forces which he &s;hall be &s;ure enough to find united.</P>
<P>His rea&s;ons why this government, being once broken, is ea&s;ily held, are, that the armies once pa&s;t hope of rallying, there being no &s;uch thing as families hanging together, or nobility to &s;tir up their dependants to further reluctancy for the pre&s;ent, or to pre&s;erve them&s;elves by complacence with the conquerors, for future di&s;contents or advantages,
<PB N="127" REF="128">he that has won the garland has no more to do but to extingui&s;h the royal line, and wear it ever after in &s;ecurity. For the people having been always &s;laves, are &s;uch who&s;e condition he may better, in which ca&s;e they are gainers by their conqueror, but can never make a wor&s;e, and therefore they lo&s;e nothing by him. Hence ALEXANDER having con|quered the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> empire, he and his captains af|ter him could hold it without the lea&s;t di&s;pute, except it aro&s;e among them&s;elves.

<P>On the other &s;ide, the rea&s;ons why a government of &s;ubjects is ea&s;ier conquered, are the&s;e: That it is &s;upported by a nobility &s;o antient, &s;o powerful, and of &s;uch hold and influence upon the people, that the king without danger, if not ruin to him|&s;elf or the throne (an example whereof was given in HENRY the &s;eventh of <HI>England,</HI>) can neither in|vade their privileges, nor level their e&s;tates; which remaining, they have power upon every di&s;content to call in an enemy, as ROBERT Count of <HI>Artois</HI> did the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why a government of &s;ubjects being &s;o ea&s;ily conquered, is neverthele&s;s harder to be held, are the&s;e: that the nobility being &s;oon out of countenance in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and repenting them|&s;elves of &s;uch a bargain, have the &s;ame means in their hands, whereby they brought in the enemy, to drive him out, as tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> did both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>For the government of citizens, as it is of two kinds, an equal or an unequal commonwealth, the rea&s;on why it is the harde&s;t to be conquered, are al&s;o of two kinds; as fir&s;t, the rea&s;ons why a go|vernment
<PB N="128" REF="129">of citizens, where the commonwealth is equal, is harde&s;t to be conquered, are, that the invader of &s;uch a &s;ociety mu&s;t not only tru&s;t to his own &s;trength, in&s;omuch as the commonwealth being equal, he mu&s;t needs find them united, but in re|gard, that &s;uch citizens being all &s;oldiers or trained up to their arms, which they u&s;e <HI>not</HI> for the defence of <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> but of LIBERTY (A CONDITION NOT IN THIS WORLD TO BE BETTERED); they have more e&s;pecially upon this occa&s;ion, the highe&s;t &s;oul of courage, and (if their territory be of any extent) the va&s;te&s;t body of a well di&s;ciplined militia that is po&s;&s;ible in nature: wherefore AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A ONE OVERCOME BY THE ARMS OF A MO|NARCH, IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD.

Their iron hearts
<PB N="129" REF="130">are dead to the feelings of humanity; they regard not the cries of the fatherle&s;s, neither does the cau&s;e of the widow come near them. Ca&s;t an eye to the cruelties daily committed in the &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve trade; reflect for a moment on the many thou&s;ands of wretched Africans, who are tortared out of exi&s;tence year|ly, in order to exact from their labour, to which in ju&s;tice they have not the lea&s;t claim. Some in the various modes of obtaining them; others &s;uf|focated in the floating ba&s;tiles, by the &s;tench and corrupted air, which they breathe in the hold, while being conveyed to the land of &s;lavery and death, in the We&s;t Indies; and tho&s;e who &s;urvive the &s;hocking treatment they experience while on board, or are not &s;wept away by di&s;ea&s;e, have only a wor&s;e fate awaiting them; worked without intermi&s;&s;ion, and flogged without commi&s;eration, they are hurried to their eternal home, by tho&s;e &s;avage mon&s;ters who have the charge of them. Thus are the&s;e innocent beings murdered by the agents and &s;ervants of the devil, whom they adore and &s;erve, and who&s;e right and property they are.</P>
<P>Is not the influence of Satan very vi&s;ible in &s;ome other illu&s;trious characters, the avowed enemies of the human race, who claim and lay hold upon the tenth of the product of the earth, which have been increa&s;ed by improvement, and produced by the &s;weating brows of other men? Can there be any ju&s;tice in &s;uch plundering as this? or rather, is not that man a better character who only &s;tops you in the highway once in your life, and exacts from you your pur&s;e? You will certainly an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in the affirmitive, and declare that we are completely humbugged by the prie&s;thood. Hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of prie&s;tcraft to blind the eyes of the people, and render them totally ignorant and unaquainted in this important fact, that a prie&s;thood is, and always has been a cur&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="131">to all nations of the earth. Ignorance in the mul|titude is the chief &s;upport and only nutriment by which the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mity and pride of the clergy is fed. As tythe pigs fill their filthy &s;ties and black wai&s;t-coa&s;ts of corruption.

How long you will you not call to Belzebub to remove from you your tormentors, and take them, as his right, to his eternal kingdom?</P>
<P>There is another cla&s;s of men, in whom Luci|fer has great right, and are thus de&s;cribed by Lord Chatham: "There is," &s;ays he, <Q>a &s;et of men in London, who are known to live in riot and luxu|ry, upon the plunder of the ignorant, the innocent and the helple&s;s; upon that part of the commu|nity which &s;tands in mo&s;t need of, and be&s;t de|&s;erves the care and protection of the legi&s;lature. To me, my lords, whether they be mi&s;erable jobbers of Change-alley, or the lofty A&s;iatic plunderers of Leadenhall &s;treet, they are all equally dete&s;table. I care but little whether a man walks on foot, or is drawn by &s;ix or eight hor&s;es; if his luxury be &s;upported by the plun|der of his country, I de&s;pi&s;e and abhor him. My lords, while I had the honour of &s;erving his maje&s;ty, I never ventured to look at the <HI>Trea&s;u|ry,</HI> but from a di&s;tance, it is a bu&s;ine&s;s I am unfit for, and to which I never could have &s;ubmitted.

<HEAD>WHO WOULD NOT BE A SOLDIER?!!!</HEAD>

<P>&mdash;YOU mu&s;t drink the King of BULGARIA'S health, &s;aid the &s;oldiers; he is the be&s;t of kings. Mo&s;t willingly, replied Candide, and drank. Now you are a brave fellow, &s;aid they, you are become his &s;upport, his defender, one of the heroes of Bulgaria; your fortune is made, your fameeternal. They then put handcuffs on his wri&s;ts, conducted him to the regiment. There they made him turn to the right, wheel to the left, &s;houlder his mu&s;ket, re&s;t upon his arms, pre&s;ent, fire, march and counter-march; in return for which the drill &s;erjeant gave him &s;ome thirty &s;trokes with the cane, The next day he performed his exer|ci&s;e better, and received only twenty. On the morrow they gave him but ten, and all his com|rades regarded him as a prodigy of genius.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed Candide could not conceive by what enchantment he had become a hero. One plea&s;ant morning in &s;pring, when the birds were &s;inging, and the trees beginning to bloom, he thought proper to take a walk. Proceeding in a right line, and &s;uppo&s;ing it was the privilege of the human &s;pecies, like other animals, to make u&s;e of their legs, he had not gone above two leagues, before &s;ix other heroes, each of &s;ix feet high, overtook him, bound him, and threw him into a dungeon. He was juridically a&s;ked, whe|ther he preferred being thirty-&s;ix times flogged through the regiment, or to &s;uffer twelve balls to pa&s;s through his brains? In vain did he a&s;&s;ert the freedom of the will, and affirm, that he pre|ferred neither the one nor the other: chu&s;e he
<PB N="133" REF="134">mu&s;t, and, in virtue of that gift of God, which is called Liberty, he concluded in favour of flogging. He was twice brought to the halbards, where he each time received five hundred la&s;hes, which &s;lay|ed him from the hips to the nape of the neck, and laid the mu&s;cles and nerves all bare. As they were proceeding to the third cour&s;e, CANDIDE, unable to endure more, reque&s;ted for God's &s;ake, they would have the goodne&s;s to blow out his brains. His petition was favourably received; but, as he was kneeling blindfold, the King of the Bulgarians happened to come to the parade, and enquired concerning his crime. As this king was a man of great genius, he comprehended from the &s;tory they told him, that CANDIDE was a young metaphy&s;i|cian, ignorant of the world, and he granted his pardon; which clemency has been and will be re|corded in every newspaper, every hi&s;tory, and eve|ry age. A &s;kilful &s;urgeon iu three weeks cured CANDIDE by u&s;e of the emollients which DIO|SCO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">IDES pre&s;cribes. The &s;kin again began to cover his back, and he was able to march, when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abarians.</P>
<P>Nothing could be &s;o charming, &s;o dazzling, &s;o well di&s;ciplined, &s;o well appointed as the two ar|mies. The trumpets, drums, hautboys, fifes, and cannon formed a concert of &s;uch harmony as Hell it&s;elf never equalled. To begin, the artillery laid low about &s;ix thou&s;and men on each &s;ide. The mu&s;quetry next di&s;patched between nine and ten thou&s;and knaves, who infe&s;ted the &s;urface of this be&s;t of po&s;&s;ible worlds; and the bavonet in its turn, was the adequate cau&s;e of the death of as many more. The whole amount was at lea&s;t thirty thou|&s;and &s;ouls. CANDIDE, who trembled like a philo|&s;opher, hid him&s;elf as well as he could during this heroic butchery. At length, while the two kings ordered <HI>Te deum</HI> to be &s;ung in their two camps, he
<PB N="134" REF="135">thought proper to depart and rea&s;on el&s;ewhere on cau&s;es and effects. He pa&s;&s;ed over mountains of the dying and the dead. The fir&s;t village he came to belonged to the Aba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians; it was reeking with &s;moke, having been burnt by the Bulgarians, ac|cording to the laws of nations. Here &s;tood old men maimed by the enemy. gazing on their mur|dered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ives with their dead children extended on their bleeding bo&s;oms. There lay virgins with their wombs ripped open, after having appea&s;ed the natural appetites of certain heroes, giving up the gho&s;t. Others half ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, called aloud for one to come and di&s;patch them entirely. Here the brains of men were &s;cattered, here their arms, here their legs and here their mangled trunks. CANDIDE fled with all his might to another village, that be|lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to the Bulgarians, which the heroes of Aba|ria had treated in much the &s;ame manner. At length. marching over limbs &s;till trembling, hearts &s;till p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lpitating, and fires yet unextingui&s;hed, he luckily e&s;caped from the theatre of war and glory.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE GOVERNMENT OF HELL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>(From a Pamphlet entitled: The Rights of the Devil.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have a long time di&s;puted, and are not yet agreed in this point, what is the be&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous form of government for any na|tion, and for the people whereof it con&s;i&s;ts. Some are for a democracy, others for ari&s;tocracy, and others for monarchy. Although each of the&s;e opi|nions has its favourites, and is &s;upported by very &s;olid rea&s;ons; it neverthele&s;s appears certain, that monarchy prevails over the other two, becau&s;e the four great empires which &s;ucceeded one another in the world, and exi&s;ted near two thou&s;and years, all adopted and followed a monarchial form of govern|ment. And it appears to be an indi&s;putable fact, that this is the government of the infernal empire (viz) an ab&s;olute monarchy. It is undoubtedly the be&s;t form of government for the monarch, what|ever it may be for the &s;ubjects, becau&s;e the Devil a&s;&s;umes the power of the whole ma&s;s of beings col|lectively, and con&s;equently can make what aggran|dizement he plea&s;es at the expence of his va&s;&s;als, and they dare not grunt their di&s;approbation. Thus, you &s;ee the Devil has a right and property in his &s;ubjects, as he, like earthly monarchs, can rob and plunder them at his plea&s;ure, and is account|able to no one for his deeds; for it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, "That kings can do no wrong." There|fore, Lucifer, as King of Hell, cannot act ami&s;s. But you are ready to a&s;k, from whence did the De|vil derive the&s;e ine&s;timable rights and privileges? Did the people, his &s;ubjects, give up their rights? No: he acquired them by a&s;&s;umption; and by God's permi&s;&s;ion, he has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e valuable rights through a &s;eries of ages, and will continue to enjoy them for ages to come, as their is no heir apparent to lucceed him.

His recommendation was law, and he was able to command the whole power of that people for any purpo&s;e of defence.

<P>I believe the virtue of that great man to be equal to the highe&s;t human virtue that has ever yet been known; but to an American eye no extraordinary portion of it could appear in that tran&s;action.

<HEAD><HI>Defects in the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, as to Repre&s;entation. From the</HI> Complaints of the Poor People of Eng|land.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> G. Dyer. B. A.</BYLINE>
<P>IN England few poor men have any &s;hare in making the laws. Some may probably think, and certain politicians a&s;&s;ert, that poor men have neither the power, nor the right, to make laws. What is this, but to a&s;&s;ert, that the poor man's portion in England is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wery. I do not &s;ay, that the poor people of Eng|land are &s;laves. But this I &s;ay, that all freemen make their own laws; and I do but &s;peak after our be&s;t po|litical writers. Will gentlemen tell me, why poor men are to be &s;laves? However, while I con&s;ider every man's right to make laws, as his mo&s;t &s;acred pro|perty, and the exerci&s;e of that right as e&s;&s;ential to li|berty, whoever cannot exerci&s;e that right, be he ever &s;o rich, I mu&s;t at lea&s;t con&s;ider as poor; in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e poor. My complaints, therefore, do not confine them|&s;elves
<PB N="146" REF="147">to paupers, commonly &s;o called. Many poor men live in England, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thou&s;ands!</P>
<P>There are two ways of making laws, viz. in our own per&s;ons, or by repre&s;entatives. If a country be large and populous, all the people cannot a&s;&s;emble and con&s;ult together for the purpo&s;e of making laws: but if they authorize per&s;ons, acquainted with their wants, and intere&s;ted in their happine&s;s, to repre&s;ent them, every good end may be an&s;wered. The only danger is, le&s;t the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould not expre&s;s the public mind. Never will they expre&s;s it, unle&s;s they repre&s;ent the public.&mdash;This is the ca&s;e in England: the government of which it is u&s;ual to call a limited monarchy, in reference to the per&s;on of the prince. But in reference to the people, &s;o great a part of whom have no &s;hare in repre&s;entation, it might be called, notwith&s;tanding what we &s;ay of the hou&s;e of commons, a mixt ari&s;tocracy, as Poland has been called.</P>
<P>The king, the hou&s;e of peers, and the hou&s;e of commons, compo&s;e what are called the three branches of the con&s;titution&mdash;the king in his own per&s;on, the nobles in their own per&s;ons. What is a hou&s;e of com|mons? It is &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the people: but &s;ome &s;ay, it is a fiction; that is, that it does not ex|i&s;t, but that it is only &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t. When men inquire into facts, what are called theories frequently vani&s;h. We talk of a hou&s;e of commons, of a hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; it is the glory of Britons! and foreigners laugh at us. They a&s;k us, Where is this hou&s;e? I leave others to an&s;wer this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If this hou&s;e of commons were indeed &s;omething more than a fiction, I &s;hould my&s;elf retract a little of my wonted admiration. A hou&s;e of commons, fairly and equally repre&s;enting all the people of England, never did exi&s;t. But if it were not a mere fiction, if it were a reality, I &s;hould &s;till be obliged to yield &s;omething to the following remark, viz. that a hou&s;e of commons &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome &s;uperior hou&s;e, of nobles,
<PB N="147" REF="148">or &s;ome &s;uch name. But where any order of men exi&s;ts, of &s;eparate claims and of &s;eparate intere&s;ts from the people, and who&s;e &s;eparate characters give them a kind of &s;acred &s;uperiority over the people, liberty may perhaps be endangered. It has been a&s;&s;erted, whether ju&s;tly I do not determine, that &s;uch a hou&s;e as that of a hou&s;e of commons exi&s;ts in no free &s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here make a &s;ew remarks on nobility. I will repeat what an ancient writer &s;ays: "In no &s;tate," &s;ays he, "are the nobles favourable to the peo|ple: equals are favourable to equals." And el&s;e|where he ob&s;erves, in every part of the earth, the go|vernment of the nobles is incon&s;i&s;tent with that of the people: and he gives his rea&s;ons for the opp&s;i|tion of the two orders. A French writer, perhaps, had his eye on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, when he &s;aid, the Eng|li&s;h nobility baried them&s;elves with Charles I. under the ruins of the throne. He adds, "they think it an honour to obey a king, but con&s;ider it as the lowe&s;t infamy to &s;nare the power with the people.</P>
<P>It might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn, that a patent nobility made no part of the old Engli&s;h government, or of the other governments of Europe. Xenophon and Monte&s;quieu were friends, the one to ari&s;tocracy, the other to monarchy, yet nobody ever more expo&s;ed them. It is of a government, where an hereditary patent nobility is &s;aid to balance the two extremes of monarchy and democracy, that Black&s;tone ob&s;erves, "It creates and pre&s;erves that gradual &s;cale of dig|nity, which proceeds from the beggar to the prince, ri&s;ing like a pyramid from a broad foundation, and dimini&s;hing to a point as it ri&s;es. It is this a&s;cend|ing and contracting proportion, that adds &s;tability to any government; for when the departure is &s;udden from one extreme to another, we may pronounce that &s;tate to be precarious." This is beautiful, flattering al&s;o to national vanity, but it is theoretical. The a&s;cending and contracting proportion is &s;een among mo&s;t of the American &s;tates, in a hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives
<PB N="148" REF="149">cho&s;en by the people, in a &s;enate appointed by the repre&s;entatives, and in a pre&s;ident, or governor, appointed mediately or immediately by the people: yet the Americans have no nobles. The &s;y&s;tem of ari&s;tocracy, they think, tends to weakne&s;s. It di&s;|&s;olves, they &s;ay, the ties of families by the law of pri|mogeniture; exhau&s;ts the public money in places for the younger branches of noble families; keeps the orders of &s;ociety in a kind of dwar&s;i&s;h &s;tate, by per|petuating the maxims of a barbarous age; weakens the legi&s;lature by advancing men to legi&s;lation, who&s;e private regards ab&s;orb public &s;pirit, and who are ir|re&s;pon&s;ible to the nation; and, by dividing man from man, enfeebles the order of human beings. Who can tell where the tide of contingencies will flow? France, in who&s;e political fabric nobility did indeed &s;eem to form the great Corinthian capital, &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary to remove it, to rai&s;e a government of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"I have al&s;o admitted that an order of nobles might exi&s;t without a patent nobility. I have not &s;aid that it is nece&s;&s;ary; or if nece&s;&s;ary, that an hereditary nobility is. Its great u&s;e may be thought to con&s;i&s;t in forming a kind of &s;enate to give bias and con&s;i&s;tency to other powers, and to produce a harmony in &s;tates; a &s;enate has even been thought e&s;&s;ential to a republic. France, we have been told, has left out of her political fabric the pillar of &s;trength. "Never," &s;ays a writer, "before this time was heard of a body politic without &s;uch a council;" yet Geneva, in the infancy of the republic, was &s;uch: a more &s;cientific writer than Mr. Burke, though he el&s;ewhere &s;ays, that a king and peo|ple may exi&s;t without a &s;enate, yet does, in fact, &s;ay, "there never was a good government in the world, that did not con&s;i&s;t of the three &s;imple &s;pecies, of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy."</P>
<P>"Yet France has thought otherwi&s;e. She thinks, that by breaking the di&s;tinctions between man and man, &s;he &s;trengthens &s;ociety, and makes the public force permanent by uniting it in a national a&s;&s;embly.
<PB N="149" REF="150">I decide nothing on the truth of the&s;e &s;entiments: I propo&s;e the&s;e que&s;tions:&mdash;Was it not the exi&s;tence of the two orders of patricians and plebeians, that pro|moted all the di&s;orders of the Roman government, Were not the &s;enatus con&s;ulta and the plebi&s;cita fre|quently little el&s;e than exclu&s;ive decrees for particular intere&s;ts? And while the patricians were encroach|ing on the plebeians, the tribunes, called to the aid of the plebeians, became in their turn factious dema|gogues. Amid private regards was not public li|berty unknown? Was it not a &s;enate that de&s;troyed the liberties of Geneva?"</P>
<P>But to return to the Hou&s;e of commons. Whom, or what does a hou&s;e of commons repre&s;ent?&mdash;not al|ways rational beings, men and women; but for the greater part, property; and property of a particular kind. Property, though ever &s;o large, copyhold, lea&s;ehold, or per&s;onal, cannot be repre&s;ented, but free|hold e&s;tates only, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by men. Females, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 100,000 l, a year, either in land or money, have no repre&s;entatives. Since the reign of Henry VI. none can be electors of knights of the &s;hire, but men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of forty &s;hillings a year. But how few poor men have freeholds! Some pari&s;hes con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal hundred per&s;ons, perhaps, have not a &s;ingle freeholder. Some of the large&s;t and mo&s;t wealthy towns in England have not a &s;ingle repre&s;entative. I have not yet &s;poken of boroughs. But our theory be|gins to vani&s;h!</P>
<P>If the reader can avoid &s;miling at the following facts, I &s;hall think him fimple; if he feel no indig|nation, I &s;hall think him &s;omething wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The borough of Midhur&s;t in Su&s;&s;ex, it is well known, contains not a &s;ingle hou&s;e, and yet &s;ends two members to Parliament. The right of election is in one hundred and twenty burgage-holds; the former &s;ituation of which is marked out by a &s;tone on each &s;ide.&mdash;The borough of Old Sarum, in Wilt&s;hire &s;ends two members to parliament; yet there is but one or
<PB N="150" REF="151">two hou&s;es &s;tanding. The members are cho&s;en by a bailiff, and &s;ix burge&s;&s;es, appointed by Lord Camel|ford, <HI>the lord of the borough,</HI> and entru&s;ted by him with burgage-&s;cites. The borough of Gatton and Ca&s;tle-Ri&s;ing have each two hou&s;es only, and two re|pre&s;entatives each.</P>
<P>The tenures of Midhur&s;t, I would ob&s;erve, make no part of the town of Midhur&s;t. They were the property of the late Lord Montague, who, at the time of the election, made a temporary a&s;&s;ignment of a part of them, either to &s;ome of his dome&s;tics or friends, in order to have tho&s;e members returned that he &s;hould nominate. The tru&s;tees of the e&s;tates of the pre&s;ent lord &s;old the&s;e burgage-holds to the earl of Egremont for 40,000 guineas, who&s;e brothers were returned for this borough the la&s;t general election.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tings, in Su&s;&s;ex, before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ing of Mr. Crewe's bill, was entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of the trea|&s;ury. The number of voters was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">out twenty, all of whom had places under government, or were pro|vided for &s;ome other way. This is the borough I think, in the management of which a Mr. Collins ac|quired a mo&s;t &s;plendid fortune, and made ample pro|vi&s;ion for five co-heire&s;&s;es, his daughters. The bo|rough of Ha&s;tings, I think, is &s;till in the <HI>management</HI> of government. The&s;e are what are called rotten bo|roughs.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that &s;ome large towns, and the&s;e abounding with manufactories, have not a &s;ingle repre&s;entative: and even where property is repre&s;ented, it is not repre&s;ented equally. The county of Mid|dle&s;ex, in 1693, paid 80 parts of the land tax, and in 1697, 185 of the &s;ub&s;idy, and &s;ent only eight mem|bers to parliament; while Cornwall paid but eight parts of the land tax, and five only of the &s;ub&s;idy and yet &s;ent forty-four. As to the rotten boroughs, of &s;ome of which I have ju&s;t &s;poken, they repre&s;ent nobody; they are private property. The per&s;ons who are cho&s;en for them repre&s;ent nobody, yet they have

<HEAD>AN APOLOGY FOR YOUNGER BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>By the Author of</HI> A Plea for a Common Wealth. <HI>Printed in the Year</HI> 1659.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been a long received cu&s;tom in this land, or at lea&s;t, of as ancient date as the Norman monar|chy, that notwith&s;tanding the elder &s;on obtains the whole inheritance, yet to be&s;tow a generous and li|beral education on the younger, in which, con&s;ider|ing the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times, together with the complexion of their government, I find no cau&s;e wherefore to accu&s;e our ance&s;tors, of either impru|dence or inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, the levelling of e&s;tates hath always (and that ju&s;tly enough) been accounted altogether un|&s;uitable to the maje&s;ty and gaudy &s;plendor of monar|chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l government, which hath &s;ometimes, though fal&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly been &s;uppo&s;ed, not only the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and perfect form, but that which by long experience hath been found mo&s;t &s;uitable to the genius or humour of the Engli&s;h people, the intere&s;t of which government is rather to have large public revenues, with a va&s;t &s;tock of preferments, wherewith to gratify the am|bition of the more ingenious part of the gentry, who have nothing to rely on &s;ave what they can purcha&s;e in the favour of their prince. Nor was antiquity herein deceived; for when the greate&s;t part of the nation, by this means, reap their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the public revenues of the Commonwealth, and favour of the prince, in who&s;e &s;ole di&s;po&s;e they are, and on whom for this cau&s;e, they look upon as their common father; and indeed to whom they have greater obli|gations than to their own parents; there appears lit|tle probability how the pillars of &s;uch a government &s;hould be ea&s;ily &s;haken, who&s;e ba&s;is is founded on the intere&s;t of &s;o great a part of the nation, to defend it with the utmo&s;t peril of their lives and blood. Nor have we more rea&s;on to accu&s;e our ance&s;tors of im|piety
<PB N="153" REF="154">or inju&s;tice, than imprudence, &s;ince heretofore &s;o great and ample were the public revenues, that a younger &s;on could, either in church or &s;tate, by the wings of his own indu&s;try or merits, have rai&s;ed him|&s;elf to as high a pitch of honour and fairer fortunes, than tho&s;e of his elder brother's birth-right; &s;o that to be the fir&s;t-born was &s;carce a privilege, except to &s;uch as wanted worth to advance them; wherefore, while the Church and Court were open with their large train of preferments, to entertain the more in|genious of the gentry's younger &s;ons, and mona&s;teries to entomb tho&s;e of a le&s;s mercurial genius, there was little rea&s;on for commencing this complaint; for this I am compelled by the violence of truth to confe&s;s, in defence of the ancient con&s;titution of the laws and government of this nation, that whatever their other faults, they were not injurious to younger brethren, till after the &s;ale of church-lands, and the abrogating tho&s;e many preferments that were their former inhe|ritance.</P>
<P>This was the former &s;tate of the nation, in which, if younger &s;ons were debarred a &s;hare in their fathers inheritance, they might receive an ample compen&s;a|tion from the Church their mother, who&s;e jointure was no le&s;s than two thirds of the whole land; &s;o that they might &s;eem rather owned as the only children of the Commonwealth, and honourably maintained at the public charge thereof, than di&s;inherited by the unkindne&s;s of the laws. A generous education was then a &s;ufficient portion, which is now, for want of a &s;uitable employment, become a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;erving to no other end, than to di&s;cover, if not augment their mi&s;ery; &s;o much is the &s;cene of things changed &s;ince Henry VIII. &s;poiled the church of her revenues, and by con&s;equence the&s;e of the faire&s;t part of their inheritance; and yet nothing of the rigour of the ancient laws are herein abated to|wards them. It is not my intention (God knows my heart) to &s;peak a word in approbation of tho&s;e &s;uper|&s;titious
<PB N="154" REF="155">u&s;es to which any abbey or bi&s;hops lands were heretofore employed, but with reflection on tho&s;e good and pious, to which (in the opinion of &s;ome) they might have been converted.</P>
<P>Nor is it the de&s;ign of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es to retrieve eccle&s;ia&s;tical promotions, or demon&s;trate a nece&s;&s;ity of rebuilding the things we have &s;o lately de&s;troyed; but rather to &s;hew, how un&s;afe and injurious it would be to e&s;tabli&s;h and fix a Commonwealth upon the ruins and tottering foundation of a decayed monarchy: nor do I blame the prudence of our late reformers, that unhor&s;eing the pride of the clergy, and putting down the hierarchy, they rather &s;old, than re&s;erved in a public &s;tock, the revenues of the church, by rea&s;on it may &s;eem more &s;afe for a Commonwealth to keep nothing that may encourage an inva&s;ion of its liberty, or become the reward of u&s;urpation and tyranny, only I could wi&s;h, that &s;ince the rea&s;on and circum|&s;tances of our laws are quite altered, we might not &s;till build on old foundations, and entail the whole land on a few proprietors or elder brethren, to the exclu&s;ion and utter ruin of the greate&s;t part of the nation, and contrary to the intere&s;t of a free &s;tate or Commonwealth. I dare not charge all our late changes and many turnings in the balance of affairs on this account, though I cannot but ob&s;erve, that our times have rung more changes, been tuned to more different in&s;truments, and ran through more &s;e|veral forms of government, than were from the times of the Norman Conque&s;t known before, to which how much the di&s;content and poverty of our gentry may have contributed, I know not; but Solomon &s;aith, <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion will make a wi&s;e man mad.</HI> I am &s;ure the Younger Brothers are by far the greater number; and through nature's courte&s;y, commonly as rich in intellectual endowments, as poor in fortunes, and be|ing by the tyranny (as affairs now &s;tand) of Law and Cu&s;tom, debarred &s;haring in their parents e&s;tates, to which they conceive nature equally entitles them with
<PB N="155" REF="156">their Elder Brethren; <HI>it is no wonder if they de&s;ire to interrupt the peace and tranquillity of the Commonwealth,</HI> &s;ince by the &s;hakings thereof, they may probably root them&s;elves in fairer fortunes, than from its peace and &s;ettlement, they may with rea&s;on expect; and that which arms their di&s;content with fit weapons for re|venge, and renders them more formidable, is their generous education; for certainly, it is of very un|&s;afe and dangerous con&s;equence, to qualify &s;uch for great and noble undertakings, that are heirs to no other fortunes than what their valours can purcha&s;e with the ruin of the Commonwealth's peace and go|vernment. Therefore, had tho&s;e that made the pub|lic revenues a prey to their ambition, al&s;o drunk up tho&s;e &s;treams of bounty, by which the &s;chools and univer&s;ities are fed and maintained, and &s;o taken away the means as well as the encouragement of li|beral education, they had better con&s;ulted the peace, though not the honour of the nation; for &s;o long as the&s;e are open (if not better ordered), I doubt there will be vipers hatched to eat through the womb of government, by which they conceive them&s;elves in|jured and debarred, both that which nature gives them title to of their parents, and the ancient con&s;titution of the Commonwealth in public revenues, which I would not have under&s;tood as proceeding from any prejudice or ill will to the univer&s;ities, which I much honour, and in which, with thankfulne&s;s I acknow|ledge, to have received my education, but only to di&s;cover the &s;hortne&s;s of that policy, that taking away the preferments, &s;hould reward and crown all acade|mic endeavours, yet never reduced the means whereby men are qualified for an expectation, and prompted to an ambition of them; and, indeed, of a like &s;train is mo&s;t of our modern policy, not &s;kin deep, and ra|ther to be accounted &s;hifts and pre&s;ent eva&s;ions of impendent evils, than antidotes of &s;olid prudence, for either the obviating, or healing any di&s;a&s;ter or ma|lady in the body politic.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">Certainly, a generous education is not proper for &s;uch as are intended for little le&s;s than &s;laves. It is ignorance is the mother of obedience, whereas know|ledge makes men proud and factious, e&s;pecially when they conceive their fortunes and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ployments are not corre&s;pondent to the grandeur of their birth and edu|cation.</P>
<P>The younger &s;on is apt to think him&s;elf &s;prung from as noble a &s;tock, from the loins of as good a gentleman as his elder brother, and therefore cannot but wonder, why fortune and the law &s;hould make &s;o great a difference between them that lay in the &s;ame womb, that are formed of the &s;ame lump; why law or cu&s;tom &s;hould deny them an e&s;tate, whom nature hath given di&s;cretion to know how to manage it.</P>
<P>Learning ennobles and elevates the &s;oul, cau&s;ing it to de&s;pi&s;e and &s;et light by &s;mall and ba&s;e things; and therefore, where that flouri&s;hes, men are not ea&s;ily taught to &s;ubmit their necks to an iron yoke of &s;lavery; which prompts the Turki&s;h prudence to ex|tingui&s;h all &s;uch lights by which men gain a pro&s;pect or di&s;covery of the thraldom and mi&s;ery of their condition. It would drink more ink, and wa&s;te more time than I, or perhaps the reader, would willingly be&s;tow, to give an account of all the mi&s;chiefs and inconveniences that proceed from the fertile womb of this &s;ingle mi&s;take, that a generous education (not|with&s;tanding the abolition of all encouragements of learning and ingenious preferments) is a &s;ufficient por|tion for a Younger Brother. Wi&s;dom is good with an inheritance, but the wi&s;dom of the poor man is de&s;pi&s;ed. The mu&s;es without a dowry are but de&s;|picable virgins, and the unnatural, though u&s;ual di|vorce, that is at this day found between wit and mo|ney, renders both u&s;ele&s;s, if not pernicious to the Commonwealth. I doubt not, but &s;hould we take a view of things through the pro&s;pective of &s;ome men's ob&s;ervations, we &s;hould di&s;cover this in part the cau&s;e of that tranquillity and &s;ettlement, peace and
<PB N="157" REF="158">pro&s;perity, with which in former times this Briti&s;h I&s;le was crowned; as al&s;o of tho&s;e many &s;hakings and convul&s;ions in which the&s;e latter ages have &s;een her ca&s;t into: and can we expect it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e? when (as Solomon hath ob&s;erved) <HI>There is not bread to the wi&s;e, nor riches to men of under&s;tanding, nor yet fa|vour to men of &s;kill, &amp;c.</HI> which &s;eems to proceed from no other cau&s;e than the iniquity of our laws, pouring all the wealth into one channel, and conveying the whole land into the hands of a few Proprietors or elder Brethren.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, tho&s;e providence hath placed on high, on the battlements of &s;upreme power, may, if their eyes are open, and not blinded by private intere&s;t, com|mand a fairer pro&s;pect, and di&s;cern farther into the&s;e things, then &s;uch whom a meaner fortune hath left in the valley of a low and private condition; therefore, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to inform tho&s;e intelligences that turn about the orbs of government; only could wi&s;h, there were &s;uch a &s;cene of things brought forth, as may give encouragement to expect a &s;ettlement, with|out a miracle.</P>
<P>To which, as things now &s;tand, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, but that the e&s;tabli&s;hing of gavel kind, would have no &s;mall tendency; for can any thing be done more &s;uitable to a Commonwealth? or is there any thing more ju&s;t and equitable, than that all the chil|dren &s;hould &s;hare in their Parents inheritances? or in|deed is there not rather an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity thereof, &s;ince all the former avenues by which men had ac|ce&s;s to preferment are hedged up? is not the only door at pre&s;ent open to a fortune, that of the law? which is al&s;o now, together with all other profe&s;&s;ions, &s;o over&s;tocked with &s;tudents, and thereby become &s;o burden&s;ome, that the Nation will no longer endure it. For are they not nece&s;&s;itated to devi&s;e daily new quirks and &s;ubtleties, whereby &s;uits may be multi|plied, to the confu&s;ion of e&s;tates, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the people. How much more honourable would it be
<PB N="158" REF="159">to our reformation, and new e&s;tabli&s;hed government, that there were a more equal and righteous di&s;tri|bution of the things of this earth, than that the greater part of the nation &s;hould be put to &s;hift and &s;cramble for a livelihood, or be nece&s;&s;itated to live on the &s;ins of the people.</P>
<P>Why e&s;tates may not, for the future, de&s;cend regu|larly to the whole offspring that are of the &s;ame blood and family, in&s;tead of one branch thereof, I know no inconvenience in that, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e circum&s;tances we are in at pre&s;ent, being fallen into an age &s;o eagle-eyed and quick-&s;ighted, as to di&s;cern &s;pots on the &s;un, and di&s;cover corruption in the hea|vens; which the duller opticks of antiquity judged im|maculate, and as altogether incorruptible: an age that dares pry into the pious frauds, and unma&s;k the mo&s;t religious deceits, which the devouter ignorance of our ance&s;tors never beheld, but at a &s;uper&s;titious and reverential di&s;tance; an age, in which the art of living, or to gain and hone&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, is grown &s;o &s;ubtle, &s;o difficult and ab&s;tru&s;e a my&s;tery, that few are able to ma&s;ter it.</P>
<P>How many ingenious gentlemen, that are now clothed with rags and mi&s;ery, might have rai&s;ed them|&s;elves to fair e&s;tates, had they had a &s;tock wherewith to &s;et their indu&s;try on work; for can any man make brick wherewith to build them&s;elves a fortune with|out any &s;traw? How many might this have reprieved from an untimely death, who might have been u&s;eful to their country, and ornaments to the Common|wealth, had their parts and ingenuities found due en|couragements? How many brave &s;parkling wits, that might have proved bright &s;tars and &s;hining lamps both in Church and Commonwealth, have been ex|tingui&s;hed in ob&s;curity, for want of maintenance, the oil whereby their lamps &s;hould have been fed and nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Were it not far more ju&s;t to re&s;train marriage, or at lea&s;t give check, and &s;et bounds to the lu&s;t of parents,

Our law making no more pro|vi&s;ion for Younger Brethren than if they were to be cloathed like the lillies of the field, or like Elias, to expect their food from ravens, receiving no other comfort from the hands of men, than what they can &s;uck from the dry brea&s;ts of an old proverb, that God will &s;end meat where&s;oever he hath provided mouths, than which nothing more true, did not the covetou&s;|ne&s;s of men withhold it.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom of our gentry and nobility to clap &s;uch of their phlegmatic offspring, as nature had not made mercurial enough to ambiate either church or court preferments into &s;ome religious habit; and &s;o keep up the &s;plendour of their families, by prun|ing away &s;uch under-branches for the &s;ervice of the alter, as either, through their number or folly were like to let in poverty, and thereby become a di&s;pa|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gement to the noble &s;tock from whence they &s;prang, which hath prompted &s;ome to an opinion, that if in the&s;e more populous northern climates, a kind of Pro|te&s;tant mona&s;teries were erected for encouragement of cha&s;tity and &s;ingle life, e&s;pecially among the poorer &s;ort, it would (pardoning the &s;oleci&s;m of the name) be more con&s;onant to the maxims of &s;tate and true po|lley, than in tho&s;e hotter and more barren climates, where there is &s;o little danger of being over-&s;tocked
<PB N="160" REF="161">or burdened with people, that on the contrary they want men for the nece&s;&s;ary defence of their territories; of which we have a pertinent in&s;tance in Spain, who&s;e religious hou&s;es (did not their blind devotion &s;o much triumph over their policy) had long &s;ince been buried under their own ruins; for there can no other account be given, why that wi&s;e and prudent nation labouring under &s;o great a weight of affairs, and &s;carcity of men, to manage their wars, &s;hould tolerate &s;o many hives of drones; which &s;o long as they &s;hall continue, may give good caution and &s;ecurity to its neighbouring &s;tates and princes, to lay a&s;leep their fears and jea|lou&s;ies of his ever attaining that univer&s;al monarchy, at which, for &s;o many centuries, the lips of his proud ambition have been thought to water: there being little probability that his pal&s;ey hands &s;hould gra&s;p the univer&s;e, that hath not &s;trength enough to hold that little part thereof he hath already fa&s;tened on; and therefore the Spani&s;h conque&s;ts may not unfitly be compared to tho&s;e of rivers upon the banks of their channels, lo&s;ing as much in one place as they gain in others?</P>
<P>But &s;ince Providence hath been plea&s;ed in mercy to bring back our captivity, and again to ca&s;t us into the advantagious form of a Commonwealth, if gavel-kind were once e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hall &s;tand in need of no other devices for keeping out of poverty, than the &s;etting indu&s;try on work according to the opportu|nities, plentiful occa&s;ions will admini&s;ter in an equal Commonwealth. But I &s;hall now return to the lawyers, from whom I have made &s;o long a digre&s;|&s;ion. I have read, that in the more pure and le&s;s &s;o|phi&s;ticated times of our ance&s;tors, great e&s;tates have been pa&s;&s;ed in few words, and the conveyance proved more firm and good, than tho&s;e tedious, prolix, tau|tological in&s;truments, the knavery of latter ages hath introduced.

<PB N="161" REF="162">Or the like being the form of tho&s;e more &s;imple and &s;incere times; whereas now, through the fraud of lawyers, all things are &s;o ambiguou&s;ly penned, that none but a &s;phinx in their my&s;teries is able to under|&s;tand or unriddle them.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of which my&s;tery of iniquity that live upon the &s;ins of the people, are of late grown &s;o numerous, that like locu&s;ts, or an Egyptian plague, they cover the face of our land, and are thriven to &s;uch va&s;t e&s;tates, that whereas heretofore the Church and Clergy being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two thirds, of the be&s;t lands throughout the realm, gave birth to the &s;ta|tute of Mortmain for &s;ecurity of the re&s;t: we may ju&s;tly fear, unle&s;s &s;ome prudent care be taken for pre|vention of their future purcha&s;es, le&s;t this pack, &amp;c. by their quirks, &amp;c. in&s;tate them&s;elves in our in|heritances, and ingro&s;s the wealth and revenues of the whole nation unto them&s;elves, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I have often wondered, that notwith&s;tanding the grace mi&s;chief the nation hath &s;uffered by the lawyers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ning our laws and acts of parliaments, being known

<P>Now what&s;oever hath been here &s;poken out of a mo&s;t inten&s;ely heated zeal for public good, with re|flection on the abu&s;es of the law, and the profe&s;&s;ors thereof, I would not have mi&s;con&s;trued to reflect upon their per&s;ons, which I honour, and acknowledge many of them to be men of great candour and integrity, but rather of the corrupt intere&s;t of the profe&s;&s;ion, it being the de&s;ign of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es to witne&s;s only again&s;t intere&s;ts, and not to revile or a&s;per&s;e the per|&s;ons of any what&s;oever, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And, indeed, to &s;peak my mind freely, the grand error in the reformation of the&s;e times hath been its weeding out of per&s;ons, when as the blow &s;hould have been levelled again&s;t the intere&s;ts, which notwith|&s;tanding the frequent change of per&s;ons, &s;till take root, and &s;pring up in as great vigour as before; and therefore I humbly conceive, till the ax be laid to the root of every evil and corrupt intere&s;t, we may not expect to reap any great fruit or &s;ucce&s;s by our re|formation, for all fle&s;h is corruptible, and every man a lie; nor is he that marches in the rear any better able to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, or avoid the &s;nares of his place than he that fell before him.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to the &s;tile of Revelation, all un|ju&s;t and arbitrary decrees are <HI>bands of wicked|ne&s;s,</HI> by what&s;oever human authority they are impo&s;ed, becau&s;e they are contrary to moral ju&s;tice, and are oppre&s;&s;ive to the people. And though they can never bind the con&s;ciences of men, and &s;o have no moral influence, yet they are <HI>cords of oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> that &s;it hard upon their bodies and their temporal intere&s;t. Laws that are unfriendly to the temporal intere&s;t, and ge|neral good of &s;ociety; laws that are made to exalt a few to power and dignity, by &s;punging, &s;queezing, and oppre&s;&s;ing all other ranks of people, though con|trived
<PB N="166" REF="167">trived by angels, and executed by &s;aints, are <HI>bands of wickedne&s;s,</HI> which may cau&s;e people to &s;uffer for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, but can never create &s;in in di&s;obey|ing.</P>
<P>When the Rulers of a Nation, to gratify their own lu&s;ts of pride and ambition, impo&s;e heavy and oppre&s;|&s;ive burdens upon the people by legi&s;lative authority, <HI>they e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by a law,</HI> which in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, is a <HI>band of iniquity.</HI> The lu&s;ts of princes and their &s;ervants, often create their own wants, and render them nece&s;&s;itous; they then make u&s;e of their power and influence to procure laws to oblige others to &s;upply them, whether they are able or not; and what aggravates the evil, when the &s;ub|jects know and feel that they are not able to an&s;wer the heavy demands of power, they are not allowed to be judges of their own abilities. Tho&s;e that rule over others ought to be &s;ober and temperate, and make the rea&s;onable finances of &s;tate &s;erve them in executing their offices. Unnece&s;&s;ary &s;plendor and expence in government are incon&s;i&s;tent with both rea|&s;on and religion, which teach us, that it is one of the great ends of laws and government to re&s;train unruly appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. It is &s;inful in princes to coin expen&s;ive offices to &s;erve their favourites, and oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects. Nothing can be more audacious, than for men appointed to be guardians of &s;ociety, with a de&s;ign to make individuals ea&s;y and happy, to pretend to come before the Lord, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to a&s;k his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;s them. Such is undoubtedly the language of the en&s;uing Fa&s;t, and of the conduct of its authors and devi&s;ers.</P>
<P>The poor, in all parts of Britain, are groaning un|der a heavy load of taxes, devi&s;ed for new purpo&s;es, and impo&s;ed by new &s;tatutes. But for what rea&s;ons? Where is the nece&s;&s;ity? What way are they applied? Are they not intended to carry violence and de&s;o|lation, fire and &s;word, among a people, who&s;e only fault is, that they are endowed with principles, and a
<PB N="167" REF="168">&s;pirit which Engli&s;hmen once gloried in, and which &s;aved this nation from poverty and arbitrary power, and will not part with what God and nature, and the laws have given them, to gratify the lu&s;ts of men who have degenerated from the noble generous temper of their ance&s;tors, into Ea&s;tern nabobs, and Turki&s;h ba&s;haws. The&s;e men have thought &s;it to contrive war, foreign and dome&s;tic, to gratify their depraved pa&s;&s;ions, and the rich and poor throughout the nation mu&s;t be oppre&s;&s;ed to carry it on; bands of wicked|ne&s;s are twi&s;ted one year after another, and the nation groans in chains.

<HEAD>ON THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By Mr.</HI> ERSKINE, <HI>in his Speech on the Trial of</HI> THOMAS PAINE.</BYLINE>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Gurney's <HI>Edition of the &s;aid Trial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY man, not intending to mi&s;lead and to confound, but &s;eeking to enlighten others with what his own rea&s;on and con&s;cience, however erro|neou&s;ly, dictate to him as truth, may addre&s;s him&s;elf to the univer&s;al rea&s;on of a whole nation, either upon the &s;ubject of governments in general, or upon that of our own particular country: he may analy&s;e the principles of its con&s;titution, point out its errors and defects, examine and publi&s;h its corruptions, warn his fellow-citizens again&s;t their ruinous con&s;equences, and exert his whole faculties, in pointing out the mo&s;t advantageous changes in e&s;tabli&s;hments, which he con&s;iders to be radically defective, or &s;liding from their object by abu&s;e. All this every &s;ubject of this country has a right to do, if he contemplates only what he thinks its happine&s;s, and but &s;eeks to change the public mind by the conviction which flows from rea&s;onings dictated by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If, indeed, he writes what he does not think; if, contemplating the mi&s;ery of others, he wickedly con|demns what his own under&s;tanding approves; or, even admitting his real di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the govern|ment, or its corruptions; if he calumniates <HI>living ma|gi&s;trates;</HI> or holds out to individuals, that they have a right to run before the public mind in their con|duct; that they may oppo&s;e by contumacy or force what private rea&s;on only di&s;approves; that they may di&s;obey the law, becau&s;e their judgment condemns it; or re&s;i&s;t the public will, becau&s;e they hone&s;tly wi&s;h to change it; he is then a criminal upon every principle of rational policy, as well as upon the im|memorial
<PB N="169" REF="170">precedents of Engli&s;h ju&s;tice; becau&s;e &s;uch a per&s;on &s;eeks to di&s;unite individuals from their duty to the whole, and excites to overt acts of mi&s;conduct in a part of the community, in&s;tead of endeavouring to change, by the impul&s;e of rea&s;on, the univer&s;al a&s;cent which, in this and in every country, con&s;titutes the law for all.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ay, in the name of Thomas Paine, and in his words as author of the Rights of Man, as written in the very volume that is charged with &s;eek|ing the de&s;truction of property,</P>
<P><Q>The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations is, The pre|&s;ervation of the Rights of Man, which rights are Liberty, Property, and Security; that the nation is the &s;ource of all &s;overeignty derived from it: the right of property being &s;ecured and inviolable, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in ca&s;es of evident public nece&s;&s;ity, legally a&s;certained, and on condition of a previous ju&s;t indemnity.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are undoubtedly the rights of man&mdash;the rights for which all governments are e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;and the only rights Mr. Paine contends for; but which he thinks (no matter whether right or wrong) are better to be &s;ecured by a republican con&s;titution than by the forms of the Engli&s;h government. He in|&s;tructs me to admit, that, when government is once con&s;tituted, no individuals, without rebellion, can withdraw their obedience from it&mdash;that all attempts to excite them to it are highly criminal, for the mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons of policy and ju&s;tice&mdash;that no|thing &s;hort of the Will of a whole people can change or effect the rule by which a nation is to be governed &mdash;and that no private opinion, however hone&s;tly ini|micable to the forms or &s;ub&s;tance of the law, can ju&s;tify re&s;i&s;tance to its authority, while it remains in force. The author of the Rights of Man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine, but he con&s;ents to be convicted, and I al&s;o con&s;ent for him, unle&s;s his Work &s;hall be found &s;tudiou&s;ly and painfully to in|culcate
<PB N="170" REF="171">culcate the&s;e great principles of government, which it is charged to have been written to de&s;troy. Let me not, therefore, be &s;u&s;pected to be contending, that it is lawful to write a book pointing out defects in the Engli&s;h government, and exciting individuals to de|&s;troy its &s;anctions, and to refu&s;e obedience. But, on the other hand, I do contend, that it is lawful to ad|dre&s;s the Engli&s;h nation on the&s;e momentous &s;ubjects, for had it not been for this unalienable right (thanks be to God and our fathers for e&s;tabli&s;hing it), how &s;hould we have had this Con&s;titution which we &s;o loudly boa&s;t of? If, in the march of the human mind, no man could have gone before the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the time he lived in, how could our e&s;tabli&s;hment, by reiterated changes, have become what it is? If no man could have awakened the public mind to errors and abu&s;es in our government, how could it have pa&s;&s;ed on from &s;tage to &s;tage, through reformation and revolution, &s;o as to have arrived from barbari&s;m to &s;uch a pitch of happine&s;s and perfection, that the Attorney General con&s;iders it as profanation to touch it any further, or to look for any future amendment.</P>
<P>In this manner power has rea&s;oned in every age&mdash; Government, in <HI>its own e&s;timation,</HI> has been at all times a &s;y&s;tem of perfection; but a free pre&s;s has ex|amined and detected its errors, and the people have happily reformed them: this freedom has alone made our government what it is, and alone can pre&s;erve it; and therefore, under the banners of that freedom, to|day I &s;tand up to defend Thomas Paine. But how, alas! &s;hall this ta&s;k be accompli&s;hed? How may I expect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of? How may I addre&s;s your rea&s;ons, or a&s;k them to pau&s;e, amid&s;t the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the &s;ubject you are to judge?</P>
<P>Was any Engli&s;hman ever &s;o brought as a criminal before an Engli&s;h Court of Ju&s;tice?&mdash;If I were to a&s;k you, Gentlemen of the Jury, what is the choice&s;t
<PB N="171" REF="172">fruit that grows upon the tree of Engli&s;h Liberty, you would an&s;wer, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW. If I were to a&s;k the whole people of England, the return they looked for at the hands of Government, for the burdens under which they bend to &s;upport it, I &s;hould &s;till be an&s;wered, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW; or, in other words, an impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. So &s;acred, therefore, has the Freedom of Trial been ever held in England; &s;o anxiou&s;ly does ju&s;tice guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible bias in her path, that if the pub|lic mind has been locally agitated upon any &s;ubject in judgment, the forum is either changed or the trial po&s;tponed. The circulation of any paper that brings, or which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to bring, prejudice, or even well-founded knowledge, within the reach of a Bri|ti&s;h tribunal, on the &s;pur of an occa&s;ion, is not only highly criminal, but defeats it&s;elf, by leading to put of the trial which its object was to pervert. On this principle, his Lord&s;hip will permit me to remind him, that on the trial of the Dean of St. A&s;aph, for a libel, or rather, when he was brought to trial, the circulation of books by a &s;ociety favourable to his defence, was held by the noble Lord, as Chief Ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, to be a rea&s;on for not trying the cau&s;e; although they contained no matter relative to the Dean, nor to the object of his trial; being only ex|tracts from ancient authors of high reputation, on the general Rights of Juries to con&s;ider the innocence as well as the guilt of the accu&s;ed; yet &s;till, as the re|collection of the&s;e rights was pre&s;&s;ed forward, with a view to effect the proceedings, to guard the principle the proceedings were po&s;tponed.</P>
<P>Is the Defendant then to be the only exception to the&s;e admirable provi&s;ions? Is the Engli&s;h law to judge him, &s;tript of the armour with which its uni|ver&s;al ju&s;tice encircles all others? Shall we, in the very act of judging him for detracting from the En|gli&s;h government, furni&s;h him with ample matter for ju&s;t reprobation, in&s;tead of detraction? Has not his
<PB N="172" REF="173">cau&s;e been prejudged through a thou&s;and channels? Has not the work before you been daily publicly re|vived, and his per&s;on held up to deri&s;ion and re|proach? Has not the public mind been excited, by crying down the very phra&s;e and idea of the Rights of Man? Nay, have not a&s;&s;ociations of gentlemen, I &s;peak it with regret, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded, from what I know of &s;ome of them, that they, among&s;t them at lea&s;t, thought they were &s;erving the public; yet have they not, in utter contempt and ignorance of that Con&s;titution of which they declare them&s;elves to be the guardians, publi&s;hed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t attacks upon the Defendant? Have they not, even while the cau&s;e has been &s;tanding here in the paper for im|mediate trial, publi&s;hed a direct prote&s;t again&s;t the very work now before you; adverti&s;ing in the &s;ame paper, though under the general de&s;cription of &s;e|ditious papers, a reward on the conviction of any per&s;on who &s;hould dare to &s;ell the book it&s;elf, to which their own publication was an an&s;wer?&mdash;The Attorney General has &s;poken of a forced circulation of this Work; but how have the&s;e prejudging papers been circulated? We all know how: they have been thrown into our carriages in every &s;treet; they have met us at every turnpike; and they lie in the areas of all our hou&s;es. To complete the triumph of prejudice, that High Tribunal, of which I have the honour to be a member (my learned friends know what I &s;ay to be true), has been drawn into this vor|tex of &s;lander; and &s;ome of its members, for I do not &s;peak of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, have thrown the weight of their &s;tations into the &s;ame &s;cale.</P>
<P>By all means I maintain that this cau&s;e has been prejudged.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that I have made no motion to put off the trial for the&s;e cau&s;es, and that courts of them&s;elves take no cognizance of what pa&s;&s;es el&s;e|where, without facts laid before them. Gentlemen, I know that I &s;hould have had equal ju&s;tice from that
<PB N="173" REF="174">quarter, if I had brought my&s;elf within the rule. But when &s;hould I have been better in the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of things? And therefore I only remind you of all the&s;e hard&s;hips, that you may recollect that your judg|ment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here, upon the evidence in the cau&s;e, and not upon &s;ugge&s;tions de&s;tructive of every principle of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed of the&s;e foreign prejudices, I hope you will as little regard &s;ome arguments that have been offered to you in court. The letter which has been &s;o repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed upon you, you ought to di&s;mi&s;s even from your recollection; I have already put it out of the que&s;tion, as having been written long &s;ub&s;equent to the Book, and as being a libel on the King, which no part of the information charges, and which may hereafter be pro&s;ecuted as a di&s;tinct offence. I con&s;ider that letter be&s;ides, and indeed have always beard it treated, as a forgery, contrived to injure the merits of the cau&s;e, and to embarra&s;s me per&s;on|ally in its defence. I have a right &s;o to con&s;ider it, becau&s;e it is un&s;upported by any thing &s;imilar at an earlier period. The Defendant's whole deportment, previous to the publication, has been wholly unexcep|tionable; he properly de&s;ired to be given up as the author of the Book, if any enquiry &s;hould take place concerning it; and he is not affected in evidence, directly or indirectly, with any illegal or &s;u&s;picious conduct; not even with having uttered an indi&s;creet or counting expre&s;&s;ion, nor with any one matter or thing, incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of the be&s;t &s;ubject in England. His opinions indeed were not adver&s;e to our &s;y&s;tem; but I maintain that OPINION is <HI>free,</HI> and that CONDUCT <HI>alone</HI> is amenable to the law.</P>
<P>You are next to judge of the author's mind and intention, by the modes and extent of the circu|lation of his work. The Fir&s;t Part of the Rights of Man, Mr. Attorney General tells you, he did not pro&s;ecute, although it was in circulation through the country for a year and a half together, becau&s;e it

You cannot indeed do ju&s;tice without it. The mo&s;t common letter, even in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, cannot be read in a cau&s;e to prove an obligation for twenty &s;hillings with|out the whole being read, that the writer's meaning may be &s;een without deception. But in a criminal charge of only four pages and a half, out of a work containing nearly two hundred, you cannot, with even the appearance of common ju&s;tice, pronounce a judgment without the mo&s;t deliberate and cautious compari&s;on. I ob&s;erve, that the noble and learned Judge confirms me in this ob&s;ervation. But if any given part of a work be legally explanatory, of every other part of it, the preface, a <HI>fortiori,</HI> is the mo&s;t ma|terial; becau&s;e the preface is the author's own key to his writing: it is there that he takes the reader by the hand, and introduces him to his &s;ubject: it is there that the &s;pirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue. A preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or carele&s;s readers: the author &s;ays by it, to every man who choo&s;es to begin where he ought&mdash;look at my plan&mdash;attend to my di&s;tinctions&mdash;mark the purpo&s;e and limitations of the matter I lay before you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF FRANCE,</HI> As accepted by the Nation on the <HI>10th</HI> of Augu&s;t, <HI>1793.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE French people, convinced that forgetfulne&s;s of, and contempt for, the natural rights of man, are the only cau&s;es of the crimes and misfortunes of the world, have re&s;oved to expo&s;e, in a Declaration, their &s;acred and inclienable right, in order that all Citizens, being always able to compare the acts of the government with the end of every &s;ocial in&s;titu|tion, may never &s;uffer them&s;elves to be oppre&s;&s;ed and degraded by tyranny; and that the people may al|ways have before their eyes the ba&s;is of their liberty and happine&s;s; the magi&s;trates the rule of their duty; and legi&s;lators the object of their mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>They acknowledge therefore and proclaim, in the pre&s;ence of the Surreme Being<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the following De|claration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>ARTICLE I. The end of &s;ociety is common hap|pine&s;s. Government is in&s;tituted to &s;ecure to man the enjoyment of his natural and impre&s;criptible rights.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The&s;e rights are Equality, Liberty, Safety, and Property.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. All men are equal by nature, and before the law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Law is the free and &s;olemn expre&s;&s;ion of the general will. It ought to be the &s;ame for all, whether it protects or puni&s;hes. It cannot order but what is ju&s;t and u&s;eful to Society. It cannot forbid but what is hurtful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. All Citizens are equally admi&s;&s;ible to public employments. Free people know no other motives of pre&s;erence in their elections, than virtue and talents.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="177" REF="178">VI. Liberty is that power which belongs to a man, of doing every thing that does not hurt the rights of another: Its principle is nature: Its rule ju&s;tice: Its protection the law: And its moral limits are detined by this maxim, "Do not to another what you would not wi&s;h done to your&s;elf."</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The rights of manife&s;ting one's thoughts and opinions, either by the pre&s;s, or in any other manner; the right of a&s;&s;embling peaceably, and the free exerci&s;e of religious wor&s;hip cannot be forbid|den. The nece&s;&s;ity of announcing the&s;e rights, &s;up|po&s;es either the pre&s;ence, or the recent remembrance of de&s;poti&s;m.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Whatever is not forbidden by the law can|not be prevented. No one can be forced to do that, which it does not order.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. Safety con&s;i&s;ts in the protection granted by the Society to each Citizen for the pre&s;ervation of his per&s;on, his rights, and his property.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. The Law avenges public and individual li|berty of the abu&s;es committed again&s;t them by power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. No per&s;on can be accu&s;ed, arre&s;ted or con|fined, but in ca&s;es determined by the law, and ac|cording to the forms which it pre&s;cribes. Every Citizen &s;ummoned or &s;eized by the authority of the law, ought immediately to obey; he renders him&s;elf culpable by re&s;i&s;tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. Every act exerci&s;ed again&s;t a man to which the ca&s;es in the law do not apply, and in which its forms are not ob&s;erved, is arbitrary and tyrannical. Re&s;pect for the law forbids him to &s;ubmit to &s;uch acts; and if attempts are made to execute them by violence, he has a right to repel force by force.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIII. Tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;olicit, di&s;patch, &s;ign, exe|cute, or cau&s;e to be executed, arbitrary acts, are cul|pable, and ought to be puni&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIV. Every man being &s;uppo&s;ed innocent until he has been declared guilty, if it is judged indi&s;pen|&s;ible
<PB N="178" REF="179">to arre&s;t him, all &s;everity not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecute his per&s;on ought to be &s;trictly repre&s;ied by the law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XV. No one ought to be tried and puni&s;hed until he has been legally &s;ummoned, and in virtue of a law publi&s;hed previous to the commi&s;tion of the crime, A law which &s;hould puni&s;h crimes committed before it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;ted would be tyrannical. The re-troactive effect given to a law would be a crime.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVI. The law ought not to decree any puni&s;h|ments but &s;uch as are &s;trictly and evidently nece&s;&s;ary &mdash; puni&s;hment ought to be proportioned to the crime, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ul to &s;ociety.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVII. The right of property is that right which belongs to every Citizen to enjoy and di&s;po&s;e of ac|cording to his plea&s;ure, his property, revenues, labour and indu&s;try.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVIII. No kind of labour, culture, or commerce, can be forbidden to the indu&s;trious Citizen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIX. Every man may engage his &s;ervices and his time, but he cannot &s;ell him&s;elf&mdash;his per&s;on is not alienable property. The law does not acknowledge &s;ervitude&mdash;there can exi&s;t only an engagement of care and gratitude between the man who labours, and the man who employs him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XX. No one can be deprived of the &s;malle&s;t por|tion of his property, without his con&s;ent, except when the public nece&s;&s;ity, legally a&s;certained, evi|dently require it, and on condition of a ju&s;t and pre|vious indemnification.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXI. No contribution can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but for general utility, and to relieve the public wants. Every Citizen has a right to concur in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of contributions, to watch over the u&s;e made of them, and to call for a &s;tatement of expenditure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXII. Public aids are a &s;acred debt. The So|ciety is obliged to provide for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the unfortunate, either by procuring them work, or by &s;ecuring the means of exi&s;tence to tho&s;e who are un|able to labour.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="179" REF="180">XXIII. In&s;truction is the want of all, and the Society ought to favour, with all its power, the pro|gre&s;s of public rea&s;on; and to place in&s;truction within the reach of every Citizen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXIV. The &s;ocial guarantee con&s;i&s;ts in the ac|tions of all, to &s;ecure to each the enjoyment and pre|&s;ervation of his rights. This guarantee re&s;ts on the National Sovereignty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXV. The &s;ocial guarantee cannot exi&s;t, if the limits of public functions are not clearly determined by the law, and if the re&s;pon&s;ibility of all public functionaties is not &s;ecured.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVI. The Sovereignty re&s;ides in the people: it is one and indivi&s;ible, impre&s;criptible and inalienable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVII. No proportion of the people can exer|ci&s;e the power of the whole: but each Section of the Sovereign a&s;&s;embled ought to enjoy the right of ex|pre&s;&s;ing its will in perfect liberty. Every individual who arrogates to him&s;elf the Sovereignty, or who u&s;urps the exerci&s;e of it, ought to be put to death by free men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXVIII. A people have always the right of re|vi&s;ing, amending, and changing their Con&s;titution. One generation cannot &s;ubject to its law future ge|nerations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXIX. Every Citizen has an equal right of con|curring in the formation of the law, and in the no|mination of his mandatories or agents.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXX. Public functions cannot be con&s;idered as di&s;tinctions or rewards, but as duties.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXI. Crimes committed by the mandatories of the people and their agents, ought never to remain unpuni&s;hed. No one has a right to pretend to be more inviolable than other Citizens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXII. The right of pre&s;enting petitions to the depo&s;itories of public authority belongs to every indi|vidual. The exerci&s;e of this right cannot, in any ca&s;e, be forbidden, &s;u&s;pended, or limited.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXIII. Re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion is the con&s;e|quence of the other rights of man.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="180" REF="181">XXXIV. Oppre&s;&s;ion is exerci&s;ed again&s;t the &s;o|cial body, when even one of its members is oppre&s;&s;ed. Oppre&s;&s;ion is exerci&s;ed again&s;t each member, when the &s;ocial body is oppre&s;&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXXV. When the government violates the rights of the people, in&s;urrection becomes to the people, and to every portion of the people, the mo&s;t &s;acred, and the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible of duties.</ITEM>

<HEAD>[ROMAN HISTORY, <HI>continued from Page</HI> 122.]</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the expul&s;ion of the Tarquins, Rome was governed by two con&s;uls, who held their office during the &s;pace of a year, at the conclu&s;ion of which new ones were cho&s;en, by the &s;enate and people. After &s;ome time, the people found them&s;elves very much oppre&s;&s;ed by the patricians; who engro&s;&s;ed the whole power of the &s;tate, and, by various extortions, &s;uch as lending them money at exorbitant intere&s;t, and the like, had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their lands, and often &s;eized their per&s;ons, impri&s;oned, or u&s;ed them as &s;laves, (the laws permitting it in the ca&s;e of the non-payment of their debts) in a barbarous manner. Unable to bear this cruel treatment, a number of them, at the in&s;tigation of Si&s;innius Bellutus, and another Junius Brutus, took an opportunity, when the &s;tate had great need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to de&s;ert their generals, and retired to a hill three miles from Rome. In this exigence, a deputation was &s;ent to them from the &s;enate, per&s;uading them with many fair promi&s;es, to return. At the head of this deputation were T. Lartius, Menenius Agripah, and M. Valerius, all three in great e&s;teem, and of whom two had governed the republic, and commanded her armies in quality of dictator. When they were introduced to the camp of the male-contents, and had given an account of their commi&s;&s;ion, Junius Brutus, perceiving his comrades continued in profound &s;ilence, and that none of them attempted to make him&s;elf an advocate in the cau&s;e, &s;tepped forward, and thus addre&s;&s;ed them:</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">"One would imagine, fellow-&s;oldiers, by this deep &s;ilence, that you are &s;till awed by that &s;ervile &s;ear in which the patricians and your creditors have kept you &s;o long. Every man con&s;ults the eyes of the re&s;t, to di&s;cover whether there be more re&s;olution in others than he finds in him&s;elf; and not one of you has the courage to &s;peak in public that which is the con|&s;tant &s;ubject of your private conver&s;ation. Do you not know that you are free? This camp, the&s;e arms, do they not convince you that you are no longer under tyrants? And if you could &s;till doubt it, would not this &s;tep which the &s;enate has taken be &s;ufficient to &s;a|tisfy you? Tho&s;e patricians, &s;o haughty and im|perious, now &s;end to court us; they no longer make u&s;e of proud commands, or cruel threats, they in|vite us as their fellow-citizens to return into our com|mon city; nay, &s;ome of our &s;overeigns, you &s;ee, are &s;o gracious as to come to our very camp, to offer us a general pardon. Whence then can proceed this ob&s;tinate &s;ilence, after &s;uch &s;ingular conde&s;cen&s;ions? If you doubt the &s;incerity of their promi&s;es; if you fear, that under the veil of a few fine words, they conceal your former chains, why do ye not &s;peak? Declare your thoughts freely. Or, if you dare not open your mouths, at lea&s;t hear a Roman, who has courage enough to fear nothing but the not &s;peaking the truth. [Then turning to Valerius] You invite us to return to Rome, but you do not tell us upon what conditions: Can plebeians, poor, yet free, think of being united with patricians, &s;o rich, and &s;o ambitious? And even though we &s;hould agree to the conditions you have to offer, what &s;ecurity will the patricians give us for the performance; tho&s;e haughty patricians, who make it a merit among them&s;elves to have deceived the people? You talk to us of nothing but pardon and forgivene&s;s, as if we were your &s;ubjects, and &s;ubjects in rebellion; but that is the point to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Is it the people or the &s;enate who are in fault? Which of the two or|ders
<PB N="184" REF="185">was it, that fir&s;t violated the laws of &s;ociety, which ought to reign among the members of the &s;ame republie? This is the que&s;tion. In order to judge of this, without prejudice, give me leave barely to relate a certain number of facts, for the truth of which I will appeal to no other but your&s;elt and your colleague. Our &s;tate was founded by kings, and never was the Roman people more free, and more happy, than under their government. Tarqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n him&s;elf, the la&s;t of tho&s;e princes; Tarquin, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ots to the &s;enate and the nobility, &s;avoured our intere&s;ts as much as he oppo&s;ed yours. Neverthele&s;s, to avenge your wrongs, we drove that prince from Rome; we took arms again&s;t a &s;overeign who defended him|&s;elf only with the prayers he made to leave your in|tere&s;ts, and to return to his obedience. We afterwards cut to pieces the armies of Veil and Tarquinii, which endeavoured to re&s;tore him to the throne. The formidable power of Por&s;enna, the famine we underwent during a long &s;iege, the fierce a&s;&s;aults, the continual battles; were all the&s;e, or, in &s;hort, was any thing capable of &s;haking the faith which we had given you? Thirty Latine cities united to re&s;tore the Tarquines. What would you have done then, if we had abandoned you, and joined your enemies? What rewards might we not have obtained of Tar|quin, while the &s;enate and nobles would have been the victims of his re&s;entment? Who was it that di&s;|per&s;ed this dangerous combination? To whom are you obliged for the defeat of the Latines? Is it not to this people? Is it not to them that you owe that very power which you have &s;ince turned again&s;t them? What recompence have we had for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance we lent you? Is the condition of the Roman people one jot the better? Have you a&s;&s;ociated them in your offices and dignities? Have our poor ci|tizens found &s;o much as the &s;malle&s;t relief in their nece&s;&s;ities? On the contrary, have not our brave&s;t &s;oldiers, oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of u&s;ury, been
<PB N="185" REF="186">groaning in the chains of their mercile&s;s creditors? What has come of all tho&s;e vain promi&s;es of aboli&s;h|ing, in time of peace, the debts which the great had forced us to contract? Scarce was the war fini&s;hed, but you alike forgot our &s;ervices, and your oaths. With what de&s;igns then do you come hither? Why do you try to reduce this people by the enchantment of your words? Are there any oaths &s;o &s;olemn as to bind your faith? And, after all, what would you get by an union brought about by artifice, kept up with mutual di&s;tru&s;t, and which, at la&s;t, mu&s;t end in a civil war? Let us, on both &s;ides, avoid &s;uch heavy misfortunes, let us not lo&s;e the happine&s;s of our &s;epara|tion; &s;uffer us to depart from a country where we are loaded with chains, like &s;o many &s;laves, and where, being reduced to be only farmers of our own inheri|tances, we are forced to cultivate them for the profit of our tyrants. So long as we have our &s;words in our hands, we &s;hall be able to open our&s;elves a way into more fortunate climates; and, wherever the Gods &s;hall grant us to live in liberty, there &s;hall we &s;ind our country."</P>
<P>By this, and frequent &s;truggles of this &s;ort, which the people had made before, they at length attained the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tribune&s;hip, which con&s;i&s;ted of two officers annually cho&s;en out of the order of the plebeians, with authority to prevent the inju&s;tices that might be done to the people, and to defend their intere&s;ts both public and private. Rome, by this e&s;tabli&s;hment, made a great advance towards a new change in the form of her government. It had pa&s;&s;ed before from the monarchic &s;tate, to a &s;tate of ari&s;to|cracy; for upon the expul&s;ion of Tarquin, the whole authority did really and in fact devolve upon the &s;e|nate and the great: But now, by the creation of the tribunes, a democracy began to take place, and the people, by in&s;en&s;ible degtees, and under different pretences, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the much greater &s;hare in the government. A famine which raged at Rome,
<PB N="186" REF="187">&s;oon after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this office, oc|ca&s;ions great complaints among&s;t the people; and a large &s;upply of corn being procured from Sicily, by the patricians, Coriolanus, a young &s;enator, who had done great &s;ervices to the &s;tate as a general, is for taking advantage of the people's di&s;tre&s;s, to get the tribune&s;hip aboli&s;hed, which he propo&s;es in the &s;enate. The tribunes and the people, enraged at this, determined to pro&s;ecute Coriolanus, and after much altercation, de&s;ire to be heard by the &s;enate, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lation to their charge again&s;t him; where Decius, one of the tribunes, makes the following &s;peech:</P>
<P>"You know, Con&s;cript Fathers, that having by our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, expelled Tarquin, and aboli&s;hed the regal power, you e&s;tabli&s;hed in the republic the form of government which is now ob&s;erved in it, and of which we do not complain. But, neither can you be ignorant, that, in all the differences which any poor plebeian had afterwards with wealthy patricians, tho&s;e plebeians con&s;tantly lo&s;t their cau&s;es, their ad|ver&s;aries being their judges, and all the tribunals being filled with patricians only. This abu&s;e was what made Valerius Poplicola, that wi&s;e con&s;ul and excellent citizen, e&s;tabli&s;h the law which granted an appeal to the people, from the decrees of the &s;enate, and the judgments of the con&s;uls.</P>
<P>"Such is the law called Valeria, which has always been looked upon as the ba&s;is and foundation of the public liberty. It is to this law that we now fly for redre&s;s, if you refu&s;e us the ju&s;tice we demand upon a man, black with the greate&s;t crime that it is po&s;&s;ible to commit in a republic. It is not a &s;ingle plebeian complaining, it is the whole body of the Roman people demanding the coudemnation of a tyrant, who would have de&s;troyed his fellow citizens by famine, has violated our magi&s;tracy, and forcibly repul&s;ed our officers, and the aediles of the commonwealth. Cori|olanus is the man we accu&s;e of having propo&s;ed the
<PB N="187" REF="188">abolition of the tribune&s;hip, a magi&s;tracy made &s;a|cred by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths. What need is there of a <HI>&s;enatus con&s;ulium</HI> to pro&s;ecute a criminal like this? Does not every man know, that tho&s;e particular de|crees of the &s;enate, are requi&s;ite only in unfore&s;een and extraordinary affairs, and for which the laws have as yet made no provi&s;ion? But, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where the law is &s;o direct, where it expre&s;sly devotes to the infernal gods tho&s;e who infringe it, is it not to become an accomplice in the crime to he&s;itate in the lea&s;t? Are you not apprehen&s;ive, that the&s;e affected delays, this ob&s;truction you throw in the way of our proceedings again&s;t this criminal, by the pre|tended nece&s;&s;ity of a previous decree of the &s;enate, will make the people inclined to believe that Corio|lanus only &s;poke the &s;entiments of you all?</P>
<P>"I know that &s;everal among you complain it was merely by violence we extorted your con&s;ent for the abolition of the debts, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tribune&s;hip. I will even &s;uppo&s;e that, in the high degree of power to which you had rai&s;ed your&s;elves, after the expul&s;ion of Tarquin, it was neither con|venient nor honorable for you to yield up part of it in favour of the people; but you have done it, and the whole &s;enate is bound by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths never to undo it. After the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e &s;acred laws, which render the per&s;ons of the tribunes inviolable, will ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in compliance with the fir&s;t ambi|tious man that ari&s;es, attempt to revoke what makes the peace and &s;ecurity of the &s;tate?

Coriolanus is the fir&s;t who, by his &s;editious advice, has endeavoured to break tho&s;e &s;acred bands, which, &s;trengthened by the laws, unite the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate. It is he alone who is for de&s;troying the tribunitian power,
<PB N="188" REF="189">the people's a&s;&s;ylum the bulwark of our liberty, and the pledge of our re-union. In order to force the people's con&s;ent, in order to perpetrate one crime, he attempted another much greater. He dares, even in a holy place, and in the mid&s;t of the &s;enate, propo&s;e to let the people die of hunger. Cruel and unthink|ing man, at the &s;ame time! Did he not con&s;ider, that this people whom he meant to exterminate with &s;o much inhumanity, and who are more numerous and powerful than he could wi&s;h, being reduced to de&s;pair, would have broken into the hou&s;es, forced open tho&s;e granaries, and tho&s;e cellars which conceal &s;o much wealth, and would rather have fallen under the power of the patricians, or have totally rooted out that whole order?&mdash;Could he imagine, that an enraged populace would have hearkened to any law, but what was dictated by nece&s;&s;ity and re&s;entment?</P>
<P>"For, that you may not be unacquainted with the truth, we would not have peri&s;hed by a famine brought upon us by our enemies: but, having called to witne&s;s the gods, revengers of inju&s;tice, we would have filled Rome with blood and &s;laughter. Such had been the fatal con&s;equences of the coun&s;els of that perfidious citizen, if &s;ome &s;enators, who had more love for their country, had not hindered them from taking effect. It is to you, Con&s;cript Fathets, that we addre&s;s our ju&s;t complaints. It is to your aid, and to the wi&s;dom of your decrees, that we have re|cour&s;e, to oblige this public enemy to appear before the whole Roman people, and an&s;wer for his perni|cious coun&s;els. It is there, Coriolanus, that thou mu&s;t defend thy former &s;entiments, if thou dare&s;t &s;o to do, or excu&s;e them from proceeding from want of thought.

<HEAD>[<HI>Continuation of Mr.</HI> ERSKINE'S Defence of PAINE, <HI>and of</HI> The Liberty of the Pre&s;s, <HI>from page</HI> 175.]</HEAD>
<P>LET then the calumniators of Thomas Paine now attend to his Preface, where, to leave no excu&s;e for ignorance or mi&s;repre&s;entation, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:</P>
<Q><P>I have differed from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional gentle|men on the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecutions, and I &s;ince find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here &s;tate as fully, but as conci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t put a ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any law, and then compare &verbar;it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>It would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m, or what in England is called arbitrary power to make a law to prohibit inve&s;tigating the principles, good or bad, on which &s;uch a law, or any other, is founded.</P>
<P>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors, to rea&s;on on its defects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it al&s;o my practice), that it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e at the &s;ame time of every argument to &s;hew its errors, and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; becau&s;e the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and
<PB N="190" REF="191">lead to a di&s;cretionary violation, of tho&s;e which are good.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with principles and forms of government, or to what are called con&s;titutions and the parts of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandi&s;ement of particular indi|viduals, that government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that mankind are at the expence of &s;upport|ing it. The defects of every government and con|&s;titution, both as to principle and form, mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as, open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law; and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When tho&s;e defects, and the means of remedying them are generally &s;een by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen, you mu&s;t undoubtedly wi&s;h to deal with every man who comes before you in judgment, as you would be dealt by your&s;elves; and &s;urely you will not lay it down as a law to be binding hereafter even upon your&s;elves, that if you &s;hould publi&s;h any opinion concerning the exi&s;ting abu&s;es in your coun|try's government, and point out to the whole public the means of amendment, you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve men may happen to agree with you in your opinions. Yet this is preci&s;ely what you are a&s;ked to do to another; it is pre|ci&s;ely the ca&s;e before you. Mr. Paine expre&s;sly &s;ays, I obey a law until it is repealed; obedience is not only my principle but my practice, &s;ince my di&s;obedience of a law from thinking it bad, might apply to ju&s;tify another man in the di&s;obedience of a good one; and thus individuals would give the rule for them&s;elves, and not &s;ociety, for all.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will pre&s;ently &s;ee that the &s;ame principle pervades the re&s;t of the work; and I am
<PB N="191" REF="192">the more anxious to call your attention to it, how|ever repetition may tire you, becau&s;e it unfolds the whole principle of my argument: for, if you find a &s;entence in the whole book that inve&s;ts any indivi|dual, or any number of individuals, or any commu|nity &s;hort of the whole nation, with a power of changing any part of the law or con&s;titution I aban|don the cau&s;e&mdash;YES, I freely abandon it, becau&s;e I will not affront the maje&s;ty of a court of ju&s;tice, by maintaining propo&s;itions which, even upon the &s;ur|face of them, are fal&s;e.&mdash;Mr. Paine, page 162&mdash; 186, goes on thus:</P>
<Q><P>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accompli&s;hed by rea&s;on. Rebellion con&s;i&s;ts in forcibly oppo&s;ing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, therefore, to be, in every nation, a method of occa&s;ionally a&s;certaining the &s;tate of public opinion with re&s;pect to govern|ment.</P>
<P>There is therefore, no power but the voluntary Will of the People that has a right to act in any matter re&s;pecting a general Reform; and, by the &s;ame right that two per&s;ons can confer on &s;uch a &s;ubject, a thou&s;and may. The object in all &s;uch preliminary proceedings is, to find out what the general &s;en&s;e of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or chu&s;e to pay ten times more taxes than there is occa&s;ion for, it has a right &s;o to do; and, &s;o long as the majority do not impo&s;e con|ditions on the minority different to what they im|po&s;e on them&s;elves, though there may be much error, there is no inju&s;tice; neither will the error continue long. Rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will &s;oon bring things right, however wrong they may be|gin. By &s;uch a proce&s;s no tumult is to be appre|hended.
<PB N="192" REF="193">The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their intere&s;t and happine&s;s are included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlenen, the&s;e are the &s;entiments of the Author of the Rights of Man; and, whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our government, it can never change our &s;entiments concerning it, if our &s;enti|ments are ju&s;t; and a writing can never be &s;editious in the &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h law, which &s;tates that the government leans on the univer&s;al will for its &s;up|port.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this univer&s;al will is the be&s;t and &s;e|cure&s;t title which his Maje&s;ty and his family have to the throne of the&s;e Kingdoms; and in proportion to the wi&s;dom of our in&s;titutions, the title mu&s;t in com|mon &s;en&s;e become the &s;tronger: &s;o little idea indeed, have I of any other, that in my place in parliament, not a week ago, I con&s;idered it as the be&s;t way of expre&s;&s;ing my attachment to the con&s;titution, as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at the Revolution, to declare (I believe in the pre&s;ence of the Heir Apparent of the Crown, for whom I have the greate&s;t per&s;onal zeal) that his Maje&s;ty reigned in England, by choice and con&s;ent, as the magi&s;trate of the Engli&s;h people; not indeed a con&s;ent and choice by per&s;onal election, like a King of Po|land, the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible con&s;titutions; but by the election of a family for great national objects; in defiance of that hereditary right, which only becomes tyranny, in the &s;en&s;e of Mr. Paine, when it claims to inherit a nation, in&s;tead of governing by their con|&s;ent, and continuing for its benefit.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;entiment has the advantage of Mr. Burke's high authority, he &s;ays with great truth, in a letter to his con&s;tituents, <Q>Too little dependance cannot be had at this time of day on names and pre|judices: the eyes of mankind are opened; and com|munities mu&s;t be held together by a vi&s;ible and &s;olid
<PB N="193" REF="194">intere&s;t.</Q> I believe, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the Prince of Wales will always render this title dear to the people. The Attorney General can only tell you what he believes of him; I can tell you what I know, and what I am bound to declare, &s;ince this Prince may be traduced and calumniated in every part of the Kingdom, without its coming into que&s;tion, till brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge. I therefore a&s;&s;ert what the Attorney General can only hope, that, whenever that Prince &s;hall ever come to the throne of this Country (which I hope, but by the cour&s;e of nature, will never happen), he will make the Con&s;titution of Great Britain the foundation of all his conduct.</P>
<P>Having now, Gentlemen, e&s;tabli&s;hed the Author's general intention by his own introduction, which is the be&s;t and faire&s;t expo&s;ition, let us next look at the oc|ca&s;ion which gave it birth.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISTRESSES OF THE POOR, Exemplified in the LIFE OF A PRIVATE SOLDIER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From the</HI> Citizen of the World. <HI>By Dr.</HI> Gold&s;mith.</HEAD>
<P>THE misfortunes of the great, my friend, are held up to engage our attention, are enlarged upon in tones of declamation, and the world is called upon to
<PB N="195" REF="196">gaze at the noble &s;ufferers; they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing misfortunes, when the whole world is looking on? Men in &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">hances can act bravely even from motives of vanity. He only who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ave a &s;vertity, who, without friends to encourage, as quaintances to pity, or even without hope to allevi|ate his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, can behave with tranquility and in|diference, is truly great; whether pea&s;ant or cour|tier, be de&s;erves admiration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The mi&s;eries of the poor are, however, entirely di&s;regarded, though &s;ome undergo more real hard|&s;hips in one day than the great in their whole lives. It is indeed inconceivable what difficulties the meane&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ailor or &s;oldier endures without murmuring or regret. Every day to him is a day of mi&s;ery, and yet he bears his hard fate without repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear the heroes of tra|gedy complain of misfortunes and hard&s;hips, who&s;e greate&s;t calamity is founded in arrogance and pride. Their &s;evere&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es are plea&s;ures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day &s;u&s;tain, without murmuring. The&s;e may eat, drink and &s;leep, have &s;laves to attend them, and are &s;ure of &s;u&s;tenence for life, while many of their fellow-crea|tures are obliged to wander, without a friend to com|fort or to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, find enmity in every law, and are too poor to obtain even ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections, from acci|dentally meeting &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow beg|ging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and after giving him what I thought proper, de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, with an intrepidity truly Briti&s;h,
<PB N="196" REF="197">leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>'As for misfortunes, Sir, I can't pretend to have gone through more than others. Except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on, thank heaven, that I have to complain: there are &s;ome that have lo&s;e both legs and an eye; but, thank heaven, it is not quite &s;o bad with me.</P>
<P>'My father was a labourer in the country, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born; &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third; till at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it was thought I be longed to no pari&s;h at all. At length, however, they &s;ixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;|po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and had actually learned my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet.</P>
<P>'Here I lived an ea&s;y kind of a life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir far from the hou&s;e, for fear I &s;hould run away; but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me.</P>
<P>'I was next bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late, but I eat and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died. Be|ing then obliged to provide for my&s;elf, I was re&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune. Thus I lived and went from town to town, working when I could get em|ployment, and &s;tarving when I could get none, and might have lived &s;o &s;till; but happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magi&s;trate, I &s;py'd a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me. I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it: well, what will you have on't? I kill'd the hare, and was
<PB N="197" REF="198">bringing it away in triumph, when the ju&s;tice him|&s;elf; met me: he called me a villain, and collering me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I began immediately to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed and generation: but though I gave a very long account, the ju&s;tice &s;aid, I could give no account of my&s;elf; &s;o I was indicted and <HI>found guilty of being poor,</HI> and &s;ent to Newgate, in or|der to be tran&s;ported to the plantations.</P>
<P>'People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work; but alas, this kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever! I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board of a &s;hip, and &s;ent off with two hundred more. Our pa&s;|&s;age was but indifferent, for we were all confined in the hold, and died very fa&s;t, for want of &s;weet air and provi&s;ions; but for my part, I did not want meat, becau&s;e I had a fever all the way; providence was kind when provi&s;ions grew &s;hort, it took away my de&s;ire of eating. When we came on &s;hore, we were &s;old to the Planters. I was bound for &s;even years; and as I was no &s;cholar, for I had forgot my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and &s;erved out my time as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>'When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home, and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my Country. O Liberty, Liberty, Liberty! that is the property of every En|gli&s;hman, and I will die in it's defence: I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go into the coun|try, but kept about town, and did little jobs when I get them. I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then defired me to &s;tand &s;till. They belonged to a pre&s;s gang; I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and as I could give no ac|count
<PB N="198" REF="199">count of my &s;elf (that was the thing that always hob|bled me), I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier; I cho&s;e to be a &s;oldier, and in this part of a gentleman I &s;erved two campaigns, was at the battles in Flanders, and received but one wound through the brea&s;t, which is trouble&s;ome to this day.</P>
<P>'When the peace came on, I was di&s;charged; and as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ome|times painful, I li&s;ted for a land&s;man in the Ea&s;t India Company's &s;ervice. I here fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and verily believe, that if I could read or write, our Captain would have given me promo|tion, and made me a corporal. But that was not my good fortune, I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and when I became good for nothing, got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket, which I &s;aved in the &s;er|vice. This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, &s;o I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and I was pre&s;&s;ed again before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P>
<P>'The boat&s;wain found me, as he &s;aid, an ob&s;ti|nate fellow: he &s;wore that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well, but that I pretended &s;ickne&s;s merely to be idle: God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea bu&s;i|ne&s;s! He beat me without con&s;idering what he was about. But &s;till my forty pounds was &s;ome comfort to me under every beating; the money was my com|fort, and the money I might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t it all!</P>
<P>'Our crew was carried into a French pri&s;on, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in a jaiI; but for my part it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night however, as I was &s;leeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awak|ed by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his
<PB N="199" REF="200">hand. Jack, &s;ays he to me, will you knock out the French centry's brains? I don't care, &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake, if I lend a hand. Then follow me, &s;ays he, and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;ine&s;s. So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths. I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen: we had no arms; but one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door; where both the centries were po&s;t|ed, and ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the Quay, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days, before we were taken by an Engli&s;h privateer, who was glad of &s;o many good hands, and we con&s;ented to run our chance. However, we had not &s;o much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with a French man of War of forty guns, while we had but twen|ty-three; &s;o to it we went. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, but unfortunately we lo&s;t almo&s;t all our men, ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory. I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to my old jail in Bre&s;t; but by good fortnue we were re-taken, and carried to England once more.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that in this la&s;t en|gagement I was wounded in two places; I lo&s;t four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was cut off. Had I the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and the u&s;e of my hand on board a king's &s;hip, and not a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life, but that was not my chance; one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I enjoy good health, and have no enemy in this
<PB N="200" REF="201">world that I know of, but the French and the ju&s;tice of peace.'</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he limped off, leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and content.</P>

<HEAD>ON KINGS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From <HI>Godwin</HI>'s Enquiry concerning Political Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>MONARCHY is &s;o unnatural an in&s;titution, that mankind have at all times &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected it was unfriendly to their happine&s;s. The power of truth upon important topies is &s;uch, that it may rather be &s;aid to be ob&s;cured than obliterated; and fal&s;hood has &s;carcely ever been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as not to have had a ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s and powerful antagoni&s;t in the heart of its vo|taries. The man who with difficulty earns his &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, cannot behold the o&s;tentatious &s;plendor of a king, without being vi&s;ited by &s;ome &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice. He inevitably que&s;tions in his mind the utility of an officer, who&s;e &s;ervices are hired at &s;o enormous a price. If he confider the &s;ubject with any degree of accuracy, he is led to perceive, and that with &s;uffici|ent &s;urpri&s;e, that a king is nothing more than a com|mon mortal, exceeded by many, and equalled by more in every requi&s;ite of &s;trength, capacity, and virtue, He feels therefore, that nothing can be more ground|le&s;s and unju&s;t, than the &s;uppo&s;ing that one &s;uch man as this is the fitte&s;t and mo&s;t competent in&s;trument for regulating the affairs of nations.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are &s;o unavoidable, that Kings them&s;elves have often been aware of the danger to their imaginary happine&s;s with which they are preg|nant. They have &s;ometimes been alarmed with the progre&s;s of thinking, and oftener regarded the ea&s;e and pro&s;perity of their &s;ubjects as a fource of terror
<PB N="201" REF="202">and apprehen&s;ion. They ju&s;tly con&s;ider their functions as a &s;ort of public exhibition, the &s;ucce&s;s of which depends upon the credulity of the &s;pectators, and which good &s;en&s;e and courage would &s;peedily bring to a termination. Hence the well known maxims of mo|narchial government, that ea&s;e is the parent of rebel|lion, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the people in a &s;tate of poverty and endurance, in order to render them &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.

Hence it has been the le&s;&s;on perpetually read to mo|narchs: "Render your &s;ubjects pro&s;perous, and they will &s;peedily refu&s;e to labour; they will become &s;tub|born, proud, un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the yoke, and ripe for revolt.

<HEAD>ON THE REBELLION OF PRINCES.</HEAD>

Thy Princes are rebellions, and Com|panions of Thieves: every one loveth Gifts, and fol|loweth after Rewards: they judge not the Father|le&s;s, neither doth the Cau&s;e of the Widow come before them.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Fa&s;t-Day Sermons, <HI>by the Rev.</HI> J. Murray, <HI>of</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>Author of</HI> Sermons to A&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Printed in the Year</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<P>PRINCES may be rebellious by joining intere&s;ts and partner&s;hip with thieves and di&s;hone&s;t per|&s;ons. The&s;e are &s;uch as take what is not their own,
<PB N="202" REF="203">and apply it to their own purpo&s;es. This is a coar&s;e compliment to princes, but as it is given by an in&s;pired Prophet it cannot be taken ami&s;s.</P>
<P>It is rebellion again&s;t God and the laws, for rulers to take more than ju&s;tly is due to them, or join intere&s;ts with tho&s;e who do.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o di&s;hone&s;t to promote or procure laws, that may make it legal to give them more than the people can afford: this comes under the notion of theft and rebellion, according to the Prophet's idea.</P>
<P>The Princes of Judah and I&s;rael went partners with the Sovereign in the plunder of the Nation. They probably voted large &s;upplies to the king, becau&s;e they knew they would receive a &s;hare of the revenue, and might promote a law for encrea&s;ing the civil li&s;t in hopes of &s;erving in his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold; but this was theft and rebellion again&s;t ju&s;tice, and the laws of the land.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who obey the fundamental laws of govern|ment cannot be rebels, though it is manife&s;t that legi&s;|lators that make laws contrary to natural ju&s;tice and the law of God may be guilty of rebellion.</P>
<P>Not executing the laws impartially is joined with rebellion, or is rather a part of it. The fatherle&s;s and the widow were either neglected or made &s;eel all the force of penal laws when they were guilty, when tho&s;e who had influence in a tribe, or could &s;erve the ends of admini&s;tration, were re&s;cued from ju&s;tice, when they had committed the mo&s;t capital crimes.</P>
<P>This is by the Prophet accounted the very height of rebellion, and is often committed by princes and their companions.</P>
<P>Thus it is plain, that rebellion is not a crime pecu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">far to the people only, but is al&s;o &s;ometimes to be found at the very &s;prings of government.</P>
<P>Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion, but the &s;cripture informs us otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>As we are certain from the be&s;t authority, that even
<PB N="203" REF="204">princes may rebel, the que&s;tion now is, whether they ought to be puni&s;hed for it like other rebels, and who can lawfully puni&s;h them? This que&s;tion requires a little caution, and mu&s;t be determined by &s;cripture; and it is hoped that then no Chri&s;tian will di&s;&s;ent from the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whether there is any difference between trying Kings and Princes for rebellion, and puni&s;hing them without trying them, I &s;hall leave to the Tories and Cau&s;ui&s;ts to determine. For there has been more noi&s;e concerning the trial of King Charles the Fir&s;t, than concerning the puni&s;hment of all the rebellious princes &s;ince the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>This Prince is the only martyr we find among the Kings of England, though many of them have &s;uffer|ed for their tytanny and rebellion again&s;t the laws.</P>
<P>The Kings in this country are con&s;idered as the &s;ource of the laws, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that if the King could die, that all law would be at an end; for this rea&s;on the lawyers have made our kings immortal, and laid it down as a fir&s;t principle, that the King can|not die.</P>
<P>It ought to have been &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, before &s;uch a my&s;terious maxim had been laid down as a fir&s;t principle, whether laws or Kings were fir&s;t ap|pointed by the Almighty; for if ever we find laws without Kings, it will appear manife&s;t that they are not nece&s;&s;ary to the being of government, but that laws may continue when there is no monarch.</P>
<P>It is plain, that there was law before we heard any thing of any ruler except God him&s;elf, from hence it would appear, that the exi&s;tence of laws does not de|pend upon any human regal authority, and though that Kings &s;hould chance to die, the laws, if ju&s;t, will continue immortal; if they are unju&s;t, they ought never to exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE NATIONAL SIN OF SUFFERING BAD GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> A Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>for the Fa&s;t on April 19th,</HI> 1793. <HI>Entitled</HI> SINS OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE vices of nations may be divided into tho&s;e which relate to their own internal proceedings, or to their relations with other &s;tates. With regard to the fir&s;t, the cau&s;es for humiliation are various. Many nations are guilty of the crime of permiting op|pre&s;&s;ive laws and bad governments to remain among&s;t them, by which the poor are cru&s;hed, and the lives of the innocent are laid at the mercy of wicked and arbitrary men. This is a national &s;in of the deep|e&s;t dye, as it involves in it mo&s;t others. It is painful to reflect how many atrocious governments there are in the world, and how little even they who enjoy good ones, &s;eem to under&s;tand their true nature. We are apt to &s;peak of the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of living under a mild government, as if it were like the happine&s;s of living under an indulgent climate; and when we thank God for it, we rank it with the ble&s;&s;ings of the air and of the &s;oil; whereas we ought to thank God for the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> of living under a good govern|ment, for a good government is the fir&s;t of national duties. It is indeed a happine&s;s, and one which de|mands our mo&s;t grateful thanks, to be born under one which &s;pares us the trouble and hazard of changing of it; but a people born under a good government, will probably not die under one, if they conceive of it as of an indolent and pa&s;&s;ive happine&s;s, to be left for its pre&s;ervation, to fortunate conjunctures, and the float|ing and variable chances of incalculable events; our &s;econd duty is to <HI>keep</HI> it good.</P>

<HEAD>ON CIVIL LIBERTY, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> Richard Price, D. D. F. R. S.</BYLINE>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid it is obvious, that all Civil Government, as far as it can be denomi|nated <HI>free,</HI> is the creature of the people. It originates with them. It is conducted under their direction; and has in view nothing but their happine&s;s. All its different forms are no more than &s;o many different modes in which they chu&s;e to direct their affairs, and to &s;ecure the quiet enjoyment of their rights.&mdash;In every free &s;tate every man is his own legi&s;lator. All <HI>taxes</HI> are free-gifts for public &s;ervices.&mdash;All <HI>laws</HI> are particular provi&s;ions or regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed by COMMON CONSENT for gaining protection and &s;afe|ty. &mdash; And all <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> are tru&s;tees or deputies for carrying the&s;e regulations into execution.</P>
<P>Liberty, therefore, is too imperfectly defined when it is &s;aid to be "a Government by LAWS, and not by MEN." If the laws are made by one man, or a junto of men in a &s;tate, and not by COMMON CON|SENT, a government by them does not differ from &s;lavery. In this ca&s;e it would be a contradiction in terms to &s;ay, that the &s;tate governs it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From hence it is obvious that <HI>Civil Liberty,</HI> in the mo&s;t perfect degree, can be enjoyed only in &s;mall &s;tates, where every member is capable of giving his &s;uffrage in per&s;on, and of being cho&s;en into public offices. When a &s;tate becomes &s;o numerous, or when the different parts of it are removed to &s;uch di&s;tances from one another, as to render this impracticable, a diminution of liberty nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es. There are, however, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, methods by which &s;uch near approaches may be made to perfect liberty as &s;hall an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of government, and at the &s;ame time &s;ecure every right of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">Tho' all the members of a &s;tate &s;hould not be ca|pable of giving their &s;uffrages on public mea&s;ures, <HI>in|dividually</HI> and <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> they may do this by the ap|pointment of <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes</HI> or <HI>repre&s;entatives.</HI> They may entru&s;t the powers of legi&s;lation, &s;ubject to &s;uch re|&s;trictions as they &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary, with any num|ber of <HI>delegates;</HI> and whatever can be done by &s;uch delegates within the limits of their tru&s;t, may be con|&s;idered as done by the united voice and coun&s;el of the community.&mdash;In this method a free government may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the large&s;t &s;tate; and it is con|ceivable, that by regulations of this kind, any num|ber of &s;tates might be &s;ubjected to a &s;cheme of go|vernment, that would exclude the de&s;olations of war, and produce univer&s;al peace and order.</P>
<P>Let us think here of what may be practicable in this way with re&s;pect to <HI>Europe</HI> in particular.&mdash;While it continues divided, as it is at pre&s;ent, into a great number of independent kingdoms, who&s;e intere&s;ts are continually cla&s;hing, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that di&s;|putes will often ari&s;e, which mu&s;t end in war and carnage. It would be no remedy to this evil to make one of the&s;e &s;tates &s;upreme over the re&s;t; and to give it an ab&s;olute plenitude of power to &s;uperintend and controul them. This would be to &s;ubject all the &s;tates to the arbitrary di&s;cretion of one, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h an ignominious &s;lavery, not po&s;&s;ible to be long endured. It would, therefore, be a remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e; nor is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be ap|proved by any mind that has not lo&s;t every idea of civil liberty. On the contrary.&mdash;Let every &s;tate, with re&s;pect to all its internal concerns, be continued independent of all the re&s;t; and let a general con|federacy be formed by the appointment of a SENATE, con&s;i&s;ting of repre&s;entatives from all the different &s;tates. Let this SENATE po&s;&s;e&s;s tbe power of ma|naging all the <HI>common</HI> concerns of the united &s;tates, and of judging and deciding between them, as a common <HI>arbiter</HI> or <HI>umpire,</HI> in all di&s;putes; having,
<PB N="207" REF="208">at the &s;ame time, under its direction, the common force of the &s;tates to &s;upport its deci&s;ions. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, each &s;eperate &s;tate would be &s;ecure again&s;t the interference of foreign power in its private concerns, and, therefore, would po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>liberty;</HI> and at the &s;ame time it would be &s;ecure again&s;t all op|pre&s;&s;ion and in&s;ult from every neighbouring &s;tate.&mdash; Thus might the &s;cattered force and abilities of a whole continent be gathered into one point; all liti|gations &s;ettled as they ro&s;e; univer&s;al peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and nation prevented <HI>from any more lifting up a &s;word again&s;t nation.</HI></P>

The congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when REHO|BOAM would not hearken to their advice, depo&s;ed him: and we know what popular councils, &s;o &s;oon as they came to &s;ufficient power, did in <HI>England.</HI> If a prince put a popular council from this ward, he does a great matter, and to little purpo&s;e; for they under|&s;tand nothing el&s;e but them&s;elves. Wherefore the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and of <HI>Spain</HI> have di&s;&s;olved all &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies. It is true, where a prince is not &s;trong enough to get money out of them but by their con|&s;ent, they are nece&s;&s;ary; yet then they are not purely of advice and di&s;patch, but &s;hare in the government, and he cannot be meddling with their pur&s;es, but they will be meddling with his laws. The Senate is of &s;ieter u&s;e for a prince; and yet, except he has the way of TIBERIUS, but a tickli&s;h piece, as appears by MAXIMINUS, who was de&s;troyed by PUPIENUS and BALBINUS, captains &s;et up again&s;t him by this order. To go to the root: The&s;e things are not otherwi&s;e in prudence or choice than by direction of the ba|lance; where this is popular, no remedy but the prince mu&s;t be advi&s;ed by the people, which if the late king would have endured, the monarchy might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;omewhat longer: but while the ba|lance was Ari&s;tocratical, as during the great e&s;tates of the nobility and the clergy, we find not the people to have been great or wi&s;e coun&s;ellors. In &s;um, if a king governs by a popular council, or a hou&s;e of commons, the throne will not &s;tand long: if he go|verns by a &s;enate, or a hou&s;e of lords, let him never fear the throne, but have a care of him&s;elf: there is no third, as I have &s;aid often enough, but the Divan.</P>

<HEAD>ON RELIGION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MORNING CHRONICLE, <HI>Nov.</HI> 29, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>A Few days after the Bi&s;hop of Paris and his Vicars had &s;et the example of renouncing their clerical character, a Cure from a village on the Banks of the Rhone, followed by &s;ome of his pari&s;hioners, with an offering of gold and &s;ilver &s;aints, chalices, rich ve&s;tments, &amp;c. pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the Bar of the National Convention. The &s;ight of the gold put the Convention in a very good humour, and the Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a thin venerable looking man, with grey hairs, was ordered to &s;peak. I come, &s;aid he, from the village of &mdash;, where the only good building &s;tand|ing (for the Chateau has been pulled down), is a very fine church; my pari&s;hioners beg you will take it to make an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick and wounded of both parties, they being both equally our country|men; the gold and &s;ilver, part of which we have brought you, they entreat you will devote to the &s;er|vice of the &s;tate, and that you will ca&s;t the bells into cannon, to drive away its foreign invaders; for my|&s;elf, I am come with great plea&s;ure to re&s;ign my let|ters of ordination, of induction, and every deed and title, by which I have been con&s;tituted a member of your eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. Here are the papers, you may burn them, if you plea&s;e, in the &s;ame fire with the genealogical trees and patents of the nobility. I de&s;ire likewi&s;e, that you will di&s;continue my &s;alary. I am &s;till able to &s;upport my&s;elf with the labour of my hands, and I beg you to believe, that I never felt &s;incerer joy than I now do in making this renunci|ation. I have longed to &s;ee this day, I &s;ee it, and am glad.</P>
<P>When the old man had done &s;peaking, the ap|plau&s;e; were immoderate. You are an hone&s;t man, &s;aid they, all at once; a brave fellow; and the Pre|&s;ident advanced to give him the fraternal embrace.
<PB N="215" REF="216">The Cur&eacute; did not &s;eem greatly elated with the&s;e tokens of approbation, and thus re&s;umed his di&s;|cour&s;e:&mdash;"Before you applaud my &s;entiments, it is fit you &s;hould under&s;tand them; perhaps, they may not entirely coincide with your own. I rejoice in this day, not becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee religion degraded, but becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee it exalted and puri&s;ied. By di&s;&s;olving its alliance with the &s;tate, you have given it dignity and independence. You have done it a piece of &s;ervice, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s well-wi&s;hers would perhaps ne|ver have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing wanted to make it appear in its genuine beauty and lu&s;tre. Nobody will now &s;ay of me when I am performing the offices of my religion, it is his trade, he is paid for telling the people &s;uch and &s;uch things, he is hired to keep up an u&s;eful piece of mum|mery. They cannot now &s;ay this, and therefore I feel my&s;elf rai&s;ed in my own e&s;teem, and &s;hall &s;peak to them with a confidence and frankne&s;s, which be|fore this I never dur&s;t venture to a&s;&s;ume. We re|&s;ign without reluctance our gold and &s;ilver images, and embroidered ve&s;tments, becau&s;e we have never found that looking upon gold and &s;ilver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly: we can al&s;o &s;pare our churches, for the heart that wi&s;hes to lift it&s;elf up to GOD will never be at a lo&s;s for room to do it in; but we cannot &s;pare oar reli|gion, becau&s;e, to tell you the truth, we never had &s;o much occa&s;ion for it. I under&s;tand that you accu&s;e us prie&s;ts of having told the people a great many fal&s;hoods. I &s;u&s;pect this may have been the ca&s;e, but till this day we have never been allowed to enquire whether the things which we taught them were true or not. You required us formerly to receive them all without proof, and you now would have us reject them all without di&s;crimination; neither of the&s;e modes of conduct become philo&s;ophers, &s;uch as you would be thought to be. I am going to employ my&s;elf diligently along with my pari&s;hioners, to &s;ift
<PB N="216" REF="217">the wheat from the bran, the true from the fal&s;e; if we are not &s;ucce&s;sful, we &s;hall be at lea&s;t &s;incere. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fear, indeed, that while I wore the&s;e ve&s;tments which we have brought you, and &s;poke in that large gloomy building which we have given up to you, I told my poor flock a great many idle &s;tories. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, &s;ince the village has in general been &s;ober and good, the pea&s;ants are hone&s;t, decile, and laborious, the hu&s;bands love their wives, and the wives their hu&s;bands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compa&s;&s;ionate, and they have con|&s;tantly relieved the &s;ick and fugitives of all parties whenever it has lain in their way. I think therefore what I have taught cannot be &s;o very much ami&s;s. You want to extirpate pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts: but will you hinder the ignorant from applying for in&s;truction, the un|happy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have prie&s;ts, by whatever name you may order them to be called; but it is certa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould wear a particular dre&s;s, or be appointed by &s;tare letters of ordination. My letters of ordination are my zeal, my charity, my ardent love for my dear children of the village, if I were more learned I would add my knowledge, but alas! we all know very little; to man every error is pardonable but want of humility. We have a public walk, with a &s;preading elm-tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I &s;hall get together the children as they are playing around me. I &s;hall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchards, to the herds or cattle lowing around us, to tho&s;e di&s;tant hills &s;tretching one behind another, and they will a&s;k me, how came all the&s;e things? I &s;hall tell them all I know or have heard from wi&s;e men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel, I &s;hall kneel with them; they will be at my
<PB N="217" REF="218">feet, but all of us at the feet of that Good Being, whom we &s;hall wor&s;hip together, and thus they will receive within their tender minds a religion. The old men will come &s;ometimes from having depo&s;ited under the green &s;od one of their companions, and place them|&s;elves by my &s;ide; they will look wi&s;hfully at the turf, and anxiou&s;ly enquire&mdash;is he gone for ever? &s;hall we &s;oon be like him? will no morning break over the tomb?&mdash;When the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, will the good cea&s;e from doing good? We will talk of tho&s;e things: I will comfort them. I will tell them of the goodne&s;s of God; I will &s;peak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a &s;tate of re|tribution. In a clear night, when the &s;tars &s;lide over our heads, they will a&s;k what tho&s;e bright bodies are, and by what rules they ri&s;e and &s;et?&mdash;and we will conver&s;e about different forms of being, and di&s;tant worlds in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace governed by the &s;ame laws, till we feel our minds rai&s;ed from what is groveling, and refined from what is &s;ordid. You talk of Nature, this is Nature; and if you could at this moment extingui&s;h religion in the minds of all the world, thus would it be rekindled again, and thus again excite the curio&s;ity and intere&s;t the feelings of mankind. You have changed our holidays; you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors, &s;o to do; it is very immaterial whether they are kept once in &s;even days, or once in ten; &s;ome however, you will leave us, and when they occur, I &s;hall tell tho&s;e who chu&s;e to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, of the dignity of right conduct. We &s;hall talk of good men who have lived in the world, and of the doctrines they taught; and if any of them have been per&s;ecuted and put to death for their virtue, we &s;hall reverence their memories the more.&mdash;I hope in all this there is no harm. There is a book out of which I have &s;ometimes taught my people; it &s;ays we are to love tho&s;e who do us hurt, and to poor oil and wine into the wounds of the &s;tranger. It has
<PB N="218" REF="219">enabled my children to bear patiently the &s;poiling of their goods, and to give up their own intere&s;t for the general walfare: I think it cannot be a very bad book. I wi&s;h more of it had been read in your town, perhaps you would not have had quite &s;o many a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and ma&s;&s;acres. In this book we hear of a per&s;on called JESUS; &s;ome wor&s;hip him as a God; others, as I am told, &s;ay to it is wrong to do &s;o;&mdash;&s;ome teach that he exi&s;ted before the beginning of ages; others, that he was born of JOSEPH and MARY. I cannot tell whether the&s;e controver&s;ies will ever be decided; but, in the mean time, I think we cannot do otherwi&s;e than well to imitate him, for I learn that he loved the poor, and went about doing good.</P>
<P>Fellow-Citizens; as I travelled hither from my own Village, I &s;aw pea&s;ants &s;itting among&s;t the &s;mok|ing ruins of their cottages; rich men and women reduced to deplorable poverty; Fathers lamenting their children in the bloom and pride of youth; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, the&s;e people cannot afford to part with their religion. But indeed you cannot take it away; if, contrary to your fir&s;t declaration, you chu&s;e to try the experiment of per&s;ecuting it, you will only make us prize it more, and love it better. Religion, true of fal&s;e, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the mind of man, that even you have already begun to make your&s;elves a new one. You are &s;owing the &s;eeds of &s;uper&s;tition at the moment you fancy you are de&s;troy|ing &s;uper&s;tition. Let every one chufe the religion that plea&s;es him; I and my pari&s;hioners are content with ours, it teaches us to bear without de&s;pondency whatever evils may befal us.</P>

<HEAD>ON KINGS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Godwin<HI>'s Enquiry concerning Political Ju&s;tice.</HI></HEAD>
<P>[<HI>Continued from page</HI> 201.]</P>
<P>LET us proceed to con&s;ider the moral effects which the in&s;titution of monarchical government is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tleulated to produce upon the inhabitants of the coun|tries in which it flouri&s;hes. And here it mu&s;t be laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">wn as a fir&s;t principle, that monarchy is founded in imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ture. It is fal&s;e that kings are entitled to the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">nee they obtain. They po&s;&s;e&s;s no intrin&s;ic &s;upe|riority over their &s;ubjects. The line of di&s;tinction that is drawn is the offspring of pretence, an indirect means employed for effecting certain purpo&s;es, and not the offspring of truth. It tramples upon the ge|nuine nature of things, and depends for its &s;upport upon this argument, "that, were it not for impo&s;itions of a &s;imilar nature, mankind would be mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>Secondly, it is fal&s;e that kings can di&s;charge the duties of royalty. They pretend to &s;uperintend the affairs of millions, and they are nece&s;&s;arily unacquaint|ed with the&s;e affairs. The &s;en&s;es of kings are con|&s;tructed like tho&s;e of other men, they can neither &s;ee nor hear what is tran&s;acted in their ab&s;ence. They pretend to admini&s;ter the affairs of millions, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;uch &s;upernatural powers as &s;hould enable them to act at a di&s;tance. They are nothing of what they would per&s;uade us to believe them. The king is often ignorant of that of which half the inhabitants of his dominions are informed. His prerogatives are admini&s;tered by others, and THE LOWEST CLERK IN OFFICE IS FREQUENTLY TO THIS AND THAT IN|DIVIDUAL MORE EFFECTUALLY THE SOVEREIGN THAN THE KING HIMSELF. He knows nothing of what is &s;olemnly tran&s;acted in his name.</P>
<P>To conduct this impo&s;ture with &s;ucce&s;s it is nece&s;|&s;ary to bring over to its party our eyes and our ears.
<PB N="220" REF="221">Accordingly kings are always exhibited with all the &s;plendour of ornament, attendance and equipage. They live amid&s;t a &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of expence; and this not merely to gratify their appetites, but as a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trument of policy. <HI>The mo&s;t fatal opinion that could lay hold upon the minds of their &s;ubjects is, that kings are but men.</HI> Accordingly they are care|fully withdrawn from the profanene&s;s of vulgar in|&s;pection; and, when they are exhibited, it is with every artifice that may dazzle our &s;en&s;e and mi&s;lead out judgment.</P>
<P>The impo&s;ture does not &s;top with our eyes, but addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to our ears. Hence the inflated &s;tile of regal formality. <HI>The</HI> NAME OF KING <HI>every where o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">des it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lf upon us.</HI> It would &s;eem as if every thing in the country, the lands, the hou&s;es, the fur|niture and the inhabitants were his property. Our e&s;tates are the king's dominions. Our bodies and minds are his &s;ubjects. Our repre&s;entatives are his parliament. Our courts of law are his deputies. All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gi&s;trates throughout the realm are the king's of|ficers. His name occupies the formo&s;t place in all &s;tatutes and decrees. He is the pro&s;ecutor of every criminal. He is "Our Sovereign Lord the King." Were it po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould die, "the fountain of our blood, the means by which we live," would be gone: every political function would be &s;u&s;pended. It is therefore one of the fundamental principles of monarchical government that "the king cannot die." Our moral principles accommodate them&s;elves to our veracity: and accordingly the &s;um of our poli|tical duties (the mo&s;t important of all duties) is loy|alty; to be true and faithful to the king; to honour a man whom it may be we ought to de&s;pi&s;e: and to obey; that is, to acknowledge no immutable criteri|on of ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE HORRORS OF WAR.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> Dr. JOHNSON.</BYLINE>
<P>IT is wonderful, with what coolne&s;s and indif|ference the greater part of mankind &s;ee war com|menced. Tho&s;e who hear of it at a di&s;tance, or read of it in books, but have never pre&s;ented its evils to their minds, con&s;ider it as little more than a &s;plendid game, a proclamation, an army, a battle, and a tri|umph. Some indeed mu&s;t peri&s;h in the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful field, but they die upon the bed of honour, <HI>re|&s;ign their lives awid&s;t the joys of conque&s;t, and, filled with England's glory, &s;mile in death.</HI></P>
<P>The life of a modern &s;oldier is ill repre&s;ented by heroic fiction. War has means of de&s;truction more formidable than the cannon and the &s;word. Of the thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands who peri&s;hed in our late conte&s;ts with France and Spain, a very &s;mall part ever felt the &s;troke of an enemy; the re&s;t langui&s;hed in tents and &s;hips, amid&s;t damps and putrefaction, pale, torpid, &s;piritle&s;s, and helple&s;s; ga&s;ping and groaning, unpitied among men, made obdurate by a long con|tinuance of hopele&s;s mi&s;ery; and were at la&s;t whelmed in pits, or heaved into the ocean, without notice, and without remembrance. By incommodious en|campments, and unwhole&s;ome &s;tations, where courage is u&s;ele&s;s, and enterprize impracticable, fleets are &s;ilently di&s;peopled, and armies &s;luggi&s;hly melted away.</P>
<P>Thus is a people gradually exhau&s;ted, for the mo&s;t part with little effect. The wars of civilized nations make very &s;low changes in the &s;y&s;tem of empire. The public perceives &s;carcely any alteration but an en|crea&s;e of debt; and the few individuals who are be|nefited, are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have the cleare&s;t right to their advantages. If he who &s;hared the danger en|joyed the profit, and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by the victory, he might &s;hew his gains without
<PB N="223" REF="224">envy. But at the conclu&s;ion of a ten years war, how are we recompenced for the death of multitudes, and the expence of millions, but by contemplating the &s;udden glories of payma&s;ters and agents, contractors and commi&s;&s;uries, who&s;e equipages &s;hine like meteors, and who&s;e palaces ri&s;e like exhalations.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the men who, without virtue, labour, or hazard, are growing rich as their country is im|poveri&s;hed; they rejoice when ob&s;tinacy or ambition add; another year to &s;laughter and deva&s;tation; and laugh from their de&s;ks at bravery and &s;cience, while they are adding figure to figure, and cipher to cipher, hoping for a new contract from a new armament, and computing the profits of a &s;iege or a tempe&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>[<HI>Continuation of Mr.</HI> ERSKINE's Defence of PAINE; <HI>and of</HI> The Liberty of the Pre&s;s, <HI>from page</HI> 193.]</HEAD>
<P>THE Attorney General, throughout the whole cour&s;e of his addre&s;s to you (I knew it would be &s;o), has avoided the mo&s;t di&s;tant notice or hint of any circum&s;tance having led to the appearance of the Author in the political world, after a &s;ilence of &s;o many years; he has not even pronounced or even glanced at the name of Mr. Burke, but has left you to take it for granted, that the Defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous &s;ubject; and that with|out being led to it by the provocation of political controver&s;y, he had &s;eized a favourable moment to &s;tigmatize, from mere malice, and again&s;t his own confirmed opinions, the con&s;titution of this country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my learned friend knows too well my re|&s;pect and value for him to &s;uppo&s;e that I am charging him with a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; I know him to be inca|pable of it; he knew it would come from me. He will permit me, however, to lament that it &s;hould be
<PB N="224" REF="225">left for me, at this late period of the cau&s;e, to in|form you, that, not only the Work before you, but the Fir&s;t Part, of which it is a natural continuation, were written <HI>avowedly, and upon the face of them,</HI> IN ANSWER TO MR. BURKE. They were written be&s;ides under circumi&s;tances which I &s;hall hereafter explain, and in the cour&s;e of which explanation I may have occa&s;ion to cite a few pa&s;&s;ages from the Works of that celebrated per&s;on. And I &s;hall &s;peak of him with the highe&s;t re&s;pect; for, with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my hamble talents, however he may di&s;parage the prin|ciples which direct my public conduct, he &s;hall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the Writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;te|rity. After the gratitude which we owe to God for the divine gifts of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, our next thanks are due to tho&s;e, from the fountain of who&s;e enlightened minds they are fed and fructified. But pleading, as I do, the cau&s;e of freedom of opi|nions, I &s;hall not give offence by remarking, that this great Author has been thought to have changed &s;ome of his; and, if Thomas Paine had not thought &s;o, I &s;hould not now be addre&s;&s;ing you, becau&s;e the Book, which is my &s;ubject, would never have been written. Who is right and who is wrong, in the contention of doctrines, I have repeatedly di&s;claim|ed to be the que&s;tion; I can only &s;ay, that Mr. Paine may be right throughout, but that Mr. Burke cannot&mdash;Mr. Paine has been uniform in his opinions, but Mr. Burke has not&mdash;Mr. Burke can only be right in part; but, &s;hould Mr. Paine be even mi&s;|taken in the whole, &s;till I am not removed from the principle of his defence. My defence has nothing to do with either the concealment or rectitude of his doctrines. I admit Mr. Paine to be a Republican; you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee what made him one&mdash;I do not &s;eek to &s;hade or qualify his attack upon our con&s;ti|tution;
<PB N="225" REF="226">I put my defence on no &s;uch matter&mdash;he un|doubtedly means to declare it to be defective in its forms, and contaminated with abu&s;es, which in his judgment, will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all: it is in vain to mince the matter; this is the &s;cope of his Work. But &s;till, if it contains no attack upon the King's maje&s;ty, nor upon any other <HI>living</HI> magi&s;trate; if it excites to no re&s;i&s;tance to magi&s;tracy; but, on the contrary, if it even in|culeates, as it does, obedience to government, then, wherever may be its defects, the que&s;tion continues as before, and ever mu&s;t remain an unmixed que&s;tion of THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS. I therefore con|&s;ider it as no breach of profe&s;&s;ional duty, nor in|jurious to the cau&s;e I am defending, to expre&s;s my own admiration of the real principles of our con&s;ti|tation&mdash; a con&s;titution which I hope never to &s;ee give way to any other&mdash;a con&s;titution which has been productive of various benefits, and which will produce many more hereafter, if we have wi&s;dom enough to pluck up tho&s;e weeds that grow in the riche&s;t &s;oils, and among the brighte&s;t flowers. I agree with the merchants of London, that the Engli&s;h government is equal to the reformation of its own abu&s;es; and, as an inhabitant of the city, I would have &s;igned their declaration, if I had known, <HI>of my own knowledge,</HI> the facts recited in its preamble. But abu&s;es the Engli&s;h con&s;titution unque&s;tionably has which call loudly for reformation, the exi&s;tence of which has been the theme of our greate&s;t &s;tate&s;|men, which have too plainly formed the principles of the Defendant, and created the very conjecture which produced this Book.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we all but too well remember the calamitous &s;ituation in which our country &s;tood but a few years ago&mdash;a &s;ituation which no man can look back upon without horror, nor feel himfelf &s;afe from relap&s;ing into it again, while the cau&s;es remain which produced it. The event I allude to, you mu&s;t know to be the American war, and the &s;till
<PB N="226" REF="227">exi&s;ting cau&s;es of it, the corroption of this Govern|ment. In tho&s;e days it was not thought virtue by the Patriots of England to conceal their exi&s;tence from the people; but them, as now, authority con|demned them as di&s;affected &s;ubjects, and de&s;eated. the end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they &s;ought by their promulgation.</P>

I was lately commended by Mr. Burke, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for &s;trongthening my own language by an appeal to Dr. John&s;on. Were the honourable gentleman pre&s;ent at this moment, he would no doubt doubly applaud my choice in re&s;orting to his own Works for the de&s;cription of Sir George Saville:</P>
<P><Q>His fortune is among the large&s;t; a fortune, which, wholly unincumbered as it is, without one &s;ingle charge from luxury, vanity, or exce&s;s, &s;inks under the benevolence of its di&s;pen&s;er. This pri|vate benevolence, expending it&s;elf into patrioti&s;m, renders his whole being the e&s;tate of the public, in which he has not re&s;erved a <HI>peculium</HI> for him&s;elf of profit, diver&s;ion or relaxation.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cribe to &s;uch a character any principal but patrioti&s;m, when he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<Q><P>I return to you baffled and di&s;pirited, and I am &s;orry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope of &s;eeing any change in the mi&s;erable

On this melancholy d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of account, in rence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing up to you my tru&s;t, I deliver to you your &s;hare of a country maimed and weakened; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> trea&s;ure lavi&s;hed and mi&s;pent; its honours faded; and its conduct the laughing-&s;tock of Europe: our nation in a manner without allies or friends, except &s;uch as we have hired to de&s;troy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r follow-&s;ubjects, and to ravage a coun|try, in which we once claimed an invaluable &s;hare. I return to you &s;ome of your principal privileges impeached and mangled. And, la&s;tly, I leave you, as I conceive, at this hour and moment fully, effec|tually, and ab&s;olutely, under the di&s;cretion and power of a military force, which is to act without waiting for the authority of the civil magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Some have been accu&s;ed of exaggerating the public misfortunes, nay, of having endeavoured to help forward the mi&s;chief, that they might afterwards rai&s;e di&s;contents. I am willing to hope, that neither my temper, nor my &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ation in life, will be thought naturally to urge me to promote mi&s;ery, di&s;cord, or confu&s;ion, or to exult in the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, or in the ruin of property. I have no rea&s;on to contemplate with plea&s;ure the poverty of our country, the increa&s;e of our debts, and of our taxes; or the decay of our commerce.&mdash;Tru&s;t not, however, to my report: reflect, compare, and judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>But, under all the&s;e di&s;heartening circum&s;tances, I could yet entertain a chearful hope, and under|take again the commi&s;&s;ion with alacrity, as well as zeal, if I could &s;ee any effectual &s;teps taken to remove the original cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief.&mdash; Then would there be a hope?</P>
<P>But, till the purity of the con&s;tituent body, and thereby that of the repre&s;entation be re&s;tored, there is NONE.</P>
<P>I gladly embrace this mo&s;t public opportunity of delivering my &s;entiments, not only to all my

<P>I look upon re&s;toring election and repre&s;enta|tion in &s;ome degree (for I expect no miracles) to their original purity, to be that without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous.</P>
<P>If &s;omething be not done, you may, indeed, re|tain the outward form of your Con&s;titution, but not the power thereof.</P></Q>

<HEAD>ON THE AUTHORITY OF ONE COUNTRY OVER ANOTHER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> Dr. PRICE.</BYLINE>
<P>FROM the nature and principles of Civil Liberty, it is an immediate and nece&s;&s;ary inference that no one community can have any power over the pro|perty or legi&s;lation of another community, that is not incorporated with it by a ju&s;t and adequate re|pre&s;entation.&mdash;Then only, is a &s;tate <HI>free,</HI> when it is governed by its own will. But a country that is &s;ub|ject to the legi&s;lature of another country, in which it has no voice, and over which it has no controul, can|not be &s;aid to be governed by its own will. Such a country, therefore, is in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. And it de&s;erves to be particularly con&s;idered, that &s;uch a &s;lavery is wor&s;e, on &s;everal accounts, than any &s;lavery of private men to one another, or of kingdoms to de&s;pots within them&s;elves.&mdash;Between one &s;tate and another, there is none of that fellow-feeling that takes place between per&s;ons in private life. Being detached bodies that never &s;ee one another, and re|&s;iding perhaps in different quarters of the globe, the
<PB N="229" REF="230">&s;tate that governs cannot be a witne&s;s to the &s;uffer|ings occa&s;ioned by its oppre&s;&s;ions; or a competent judge of the circum&s;tances and abilities of the peo|ple who are governed. They mu&s;t al&s;o have, in a great degree, &s;eparate intere&s;ts; and the more the one is loaded, the more the other may be ca&s;ed. The infamy likewi&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, being in &s;uch circum|&s;tances &s;hared among a multitude, is not likely to be much felt or regarded. On all the&s;e accounts there is in the cafe of one country &s;ubjugated to another, little or nothing to check rapacity; and the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice and cruelty may be practi&s;ed with|out remor&s;e or pity. I will add, that it is particu|larly difficult to &s;hake off a tyranny of this kind. A &s;ingle de&s;pot, if a people are unanimous and re&s;o|lute, may be &s;oon &s;ubdued. But a de&s;potic &s;tate is not ea&s;ily &s;ubdued; and a people &s;ubject to it cannot eman|cipate them&s;elves without entering into a dreadful, and, perhaps, very unequal conte&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving farther, that the &s;lavery of a people to external de&s;pots may be qualified and li|mited; but I don't &s;ee what can limit the authority of one &s;tate over another. The exerci&s;e of power in this ca&s;e can have no other mea&s;ure than di&s;cretion; and, therefore, mu&s;t be indefinite and ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>Once more. It &s;hould be con&s;idered that the go|vernment of one country by another, can only be &s;up|ported by a military force; and, without &s;uch a &s;up|port, mu&s;t be de&s;titute of all weight and efficiency.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="declaration">
<HEAD>DECLARATION.</HEAD>
<P>I. That all true Government is in&s;tituted for the general good; is legalized by the general will; and all its actions are, or ought to be, directed for the ge|neral happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of all hone&s;t citizens.</P>
<P>II.

<P>III.

<HEAD><HI>CAUTIONS</HI> Again&s;t the natural Encroachments of Power.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From CATO'S LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>PEOPLE are ruined by their ignorance of Human Nature; which ignorance leads them to credu|lity, and too great a confidence in particular men. They fondly imagine that he, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a great deal by their favour, owes them great gratitude, and all good offices, will therefore return their kindne&s;s: But, alas! how often are they mi&s;taken in their fa|vourites and tru&s;tees; who, the more they have given them, are often the more incited to take all, and to return de&s;truction for generous u&s;age. The common people generally think that <HI>great</HI> men have <HI>great</HI> minds, and <HI>&s;corn</HI> ba&s;e actions; which judgment is &s;o fal&s;e, that the ba&s;e&s;t and wor&s;t of all actions have been done by <HI>great</HI> men: Perhaps they have not picked private pockets, but they have done wor&s;e; they have often di&s;turbed, deceived, and pillaged the world: And he who is capable of the highe&s;t mi&s;chief, is ca|pable of the meane&s;t: He who plunders a country of a million of money, would in &s;uitable circum&s;tances &s;teal a &s;ilver &s;poon; and a conqueror, who &s;teals and pillages a kingdom, would, in an humbler fortune, rifle a portmanteau, or rob an orchard.</P>
<P>Political jealou&s;y, therefore, in the people, is a nece&s;&s;ary and laudable pa&s;&s;ion. But in a chief magi|&s;trate, a jealou&s;y of his people is not &s;o ju&s;tifiable, their ambition being only to pre&s;erve them&s;elves; whereas it is natural for Power to be &s;triving to en|large it&s;elf, and to be encroaching upon tho&s;e who have none. The mo&s;t laudable jealou&s;y of a magi|&s;trate is to be jealous <HI>for</HI> his people; which will &s;hew that be loves them, and has u&s;ed them well: But to be jealous <HI>of</HI> them, would denote that he has evil de&s;igns again&s;t them, and has u&s;ed them ill. The
<PB N="247" REF="248">people's jealou&s;y tends to pre&s;erve Liberty; and the prince's to de&s;troy it. <HI>Venice</HI> is a glorious in&s;tance of the former, and &s;o is <HI>England;</HI> and all nations who have lo&s;t their Liberty, are melancholy proofs of the latter.</P>
<P>Power is naturally active, vigilant and di&s;tru&s;tful; which qualities in it pu&s;h it upon all means and expe|dients to fortify it&s;elf, and upon de&s;troying all op|po&s;ition, and even all &s;eeds of oppo&s;ition, and make it re&s;tle&s;s as long as any thing &s;tands in its way. It would do what it plea&s;es, and have no check. Now becau&s;e Liberty <HI>cha&s;ti&s;es</HI> and <HI>&s;hortens</HI> Power, therefore Power would <HI>extingui&s;h</HI> Liberty; and con&s;equently Liberty has <HI>too much</HI> cau&s;e to be exceeding jealous, and <HI>always</HI> upon her defence. Power has <HI>many</HI> ad|vantages over her; it has generally <HI>numerous</HI> guards, <HI>many</HI> creatures, and <HI>much</HI> trea&s;ure; be&s;ides, it has <HI>more</HI> craft and experience, <HI>le&s;s</HI> hone&s;ty and innocence: And whereas Power <HI>can,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part <HI>does</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;t where Liberty is not, Liberty cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Power; &s;o that &s;he has, as it were, the enemy always at her gates.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, that Magi&s;trates being accountable to none but God, ought to know no other re&s;traint. But this rea&s;oning is as frivolous as it is wicked; for no good man cares how many puni&s;hments and pe|nalties lie in the way to an offence which he does not intend to commit: A man who does not intend to commit murder, is not &s;orry that murder is pu|ni&s;hed with death. And as to wicked men, their being accountable to God, whom they do not fear, is no &s;ecurity to us again&s;t their folly and malice; and to &s;ay that we ought to have no &s;ecurity again&s;t them, is to in&s;ult common &s;en&s;e, and give the lie to the fir&s;t law of nature, that of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Human rea&s;on &s;ays, that there is no obedience, no regard due to tho&s;e rulers, who govern by no rule but their lu&s;t. Such men are <HI>no</HI> rulers; they are outlaws, who, be|ing at defiance with God and man, are protected by
<PB N="248" REF="249">no law of God, or of rea&s;on. By what precept, moral or divine, are we forbid to kill a wolf, or burn an infected &s;hip? Is it unlawful to prevent wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, and to re&s;i&s;t the authors of them? Are crimes &s;anctified by their greatne&s;s? And is he who robs a country, and murders ten thou&s;and, <HI>le&s;s</HI> a criminal than he who &s;teals <HI>&s;ingle</HI> guineas, and takes away <HI>&s;ingle</HI> lives? Is there any &s;in in <HI>preventing,</HI> and <HI>re&s;training,</HI> or <HI>re&s;i&s;ting</HI> the greate&s;t &s;in that can be committed, that of oppre&s;&s;ing and de&s;troying man|kind by whole&s;ale? Sure there never were &s;uch open, &s;uch &s;hamele&s;s, &s;uch <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fi&s;h</HI> impo&s;tors, as the advo|cates for lawle&s;s power. It is a damnable &s;in to op|pre&s;s <HI>them;</HI> yet it is a damnable &s;in to oppo&s;e them when <HI>they</HI> oppre&s;s, or-gain by the oppre&s;&s;ion of others. When they are hurt them&s;elves <HI>ever &s;o little,</HI> or but <HI>think</HI> them&s;elves hurt, they are the loude&s;t <HI>of all</HI> men in their complaints, and the mo&s;t outrageous in their behaviour: but when <HI>others</HI> are plundered, oppre&s;&s;ed and butchered, complaints are <HI>&s;edition;</HI> and to &s;eek redre&s;s is damnation. Is not <HI>this</HI> to be the authors of all wickedne&s;s and fal&s;ehood?</P>
<P>To conclude: Power, without controul, appertains to God alone; and no man ought to be tru&s;ted with what no man is equal to. In truth, there are &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions, and incon&s;i&s;tencies, and &s;o much <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> belonging to human nature, that <HI>we can &s;carce be too much upon our guard again&s;t each other.</HI> The only &s;ecurity which we can have that men will be hone&s;t, is to make it their intere&s;t to be hone&s;t; and the be&s;t defence which we can have again&s;t their being knaves, is to make it terrible to them to be knaves. As there are many men wicked in &s;ome &s;tations, who would be innocent in others; <HI>the be&s;t way is to make wickedne&s;s un&s;afe in any &s;tation.</HI></P>

<P>M. GENUCIUS and C. Curti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s being con&s;uls, the commons of Rome demand, that the plebeians may be admitted into the con&s;ul&s;hip; and, that the law, prohibiting patricians and plebeians from inter|marrying, may be repealed. In &s;upport of this de|mand, Canulcius one of the tribunes of the people, thus delivered him&s;elf:&mdash;</P>
<P>"What an in&s;ult upon us is this! If we are not &s;o rich as the patricians, are we not citizens of Rome, as well as they? Inhabitants of the &s;ame country? Members of the &s;ame community? The nations bor|dering upon Rome, and even &s;trangers more remote; are admitted not only to marriages with us, but to what is of much greater importance, the freedom of the city. Are we, becau&s;e we are commoners, to be wor&s;e treated than &s;trangers? And when we de|mand that the people may be free to be&s;tow their of|fices and dignities on whom they plea&s;e, do we a&s;k any thing unrea&s;onable or new? Do we claim more than their original inherent rights? What occa&s;ion then for all this uproar, as if the univer&s;e was fail|ing to ruin? They were ju&s;t going to lay viole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hands upon me in the &s;enate-hou&s;e. What, mu&s;t this empire then be unavoidably overturned: mu&s;t Rome of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ink at once, if a plebeian, worthy of the office, &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the con&s;ul&s;hip? The partricians, I am per&s;uaded, if they could, would de|prive you of the common light. It certainly offends them that you breathe, that you &s;peak, that you have the &s;hapes of men. Nay, to make a commoner a con&s;ul would be, &s;ay they, a mo&s;t enormous thing, Numa Pompiliu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, however, without being &s;o much as a Roman citizen, was made king of Rome. The elder Tarquin by birth not even an Italian, was, ne|verthele&s;s, placed upon the throne. Servius Tullius, the &s;on of a captive woman, (nobody knows who
<PB N="253" REF="254">his father was) obtained the kingdom, as the reward of his wi&s;dom and virtue. In tho&s;e days, no man, in whom virtue &s;hone con&s;picuous, was rejected or de|&s;pi&s;ed on account of his race or de&s;cent. And did the &s;tate pro&s;per the wor&s;e for that? Were not the&s;e &s;trangers the very be&s;t of our kings? And, &s;uppo&s;ing now, that a plebeian &s;hould have their talents and me|rit, mu&s;t not he be &s;uffered to govern us? Mu&s;t we rather chu&s;e &s;uch governors as the decemvirs? Tho&s;e excellent magi&s;trates, I think, were mo&s;tly patrici|ans. But we find, that upon the abolition of the regal power, no commoner was cho&s;e to the con&s;u|late. And what of that? Before Numa's time there were no pontifices in Rome. Before Servius Tullus's days, there was no cen&s;us, no divi&s;ion of the people into cla&s;es and centuries. Whoever heard of con&s;uls before the expul&s;ion of Tarquin the proud? Dic|tators, we all know, are of modern invention; and &s;o are the offices of tribunes; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">diles, que&s;tors. Within the&s;e ten years we have made decemvirs, and we have unmade them. Is nothing to be done but what has been done before? That very law forbid|ding marriages of patricians with plebeians, is not that a new thing? Was there any &s;uch law before the decemvirs enacted it? And a mo&s;t &s;hameful one it is in a free &s;tate! Such marriages, it &s;eems, would taint the pure blood of the nobility! Why, if they think &s;o, let them take care to match their &s;i&s;ters and daughters with men of their own &s;ort. No plebeian will do violence to the daughter of a patrician. Tho&s;e are exploits for our prime nobles. There is no need to &s;ear that we &s;hall force any body into a con|tract of marriage. But, to make an expre&s;s law to prohibit marriages of patricians with plebeians, what is this, but to &s;hew the utmo&s;t contempt of us, and to declare one part of the community to be impure and unclean? Why don't they lay their wi&s;e heads to|gether to hinder rich folks from matching with poor? They talk to us of the confu&s;ion there will be
<PB N="254" REF="255">in families, if this &s;tatute &s;hould be repealed. I won|der they do not make a law again&s;t a commoner's living near a nobleman, or going the &s;ame road that he is going, or being at the &s;ame fea&s;t, or appearing at the &s;ame market-place. They might as well pre|tend, that the&s;e things make confu&s;ion in families, as that inter-marriages will do it. Do not every one know, that the child will be ranked according to the quality of his father, let him be patrician or plebeian? In &s;hort, it is manife&s;t enough, that we have nothing in view but to be treated as men and Citizens; nor can they who oppo&s;e our demand have any motive to do it; but the love of domineering. I would fain know of you, con&s;uls and patricians, is the &s;overeign power in the people of Rome, or in you? I hope you will allow, that the people can, at their plea&s;ure, either make a law, or repeal one. And will you then, as &s;oon as any law is propo&s;ed to them, pre|tend to li&s;t them for the war, and hinder them from giving their &s;uffrages, by leading them into the field? Hear me, con&s;uls: Whether the news of the war you talk of be true, or whether it be only a fal&s;e rumour, &s;pread abroad for nothing but a colour to &s;end the people out of the city; I declare, as a tribune, that this people, who have already &s;o often &s;pilt their blood in our contry's cau&s;e, are again ready to arm for its defence and its glory, if they be re&s;tored to their natural rights, and you will no longer treat us like &s;trangers in our own country. But if you account us unworthy of your alliance by inter-marriages, if you will not &s;uffer the entrance to the chief offices in the &s;tate to be open to all per&s;ons of merit, indifferently, but will confine your chief ingi&s;trates to the &s;enate alone; talk of wars as much as ever you plea&s;e; paint in your ordinary di&s;|cour&s;es the league and power of our enemies ten times more dreadful than you do now; I declare that this people, whom you &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e, and to whom you are neverthele&s;s indebted for all your
<PB N="255" REF="256">victories, &s;hall never more enli&s;t them&s;elves; not a man of them &s;hall take arms, nor a man of them &s;hall expo&s;e his life for imperious lords, with whom he can neither &s;hare the dignities of the &s;tate, nor in private life have any alliance by marriage."</P>
<P>You have &s;een by the foregoing &s;peeches, the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;truggles between the patricians and the plebeians, which continued for many years; the people always encroaching more and more upon the privileges of the patricians, till at length, all the great offices of the &s;tate became equally common to the one and to the other. The following &s;peech, which was &s;poken above an hundred years after the foregoing one, may &s;erve as an in&s;tance and a proof of that great &s;implicity of manners, public virtue, and noble &s;pirit, which rai&s;ed that people to that height of power and dominion, which they after|wards attained. The occa&s;ion of it was this. The Tarantines having a quarrel with the Romans, in|vite Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who lands with his forces in Italy, and defeats the Roman army under the command of Laevinius. Af|ter this battle, Fabritius, with two other Roman &s;enators, is &s;ent to Tarentum to treat with Pyrrhus about the exchange of pri&s;oners. The king, being informed of the great abilities, and great poverty of Fabritius, hinted in a private conver&s;ation with him, the un&s;uitablene&s;s of &s;uch poverty to &s;uch di&s;tin|gui&s;hed merit, and that if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to ne|gociate with the Romans an honourable peace for the Tarentines, and go with him to Epirus, he would be&s;tow &s;uch riches upon him, as &s;hould put him at lea&s;t upon an equality with the mo&s;t opulent nobles of Rome. The an&s;wer of Fabritius was to this effect:&mdash;</P>
<P>"As to my poverty, you have indeed Sir, been rightly informed. My whole e&s;tate con&s;i&s;ts in a hou&s;e of but mean appearance, and a little &s;pot of ground, from which, by my own labour, I draw my
<PB N="256" REF="257">&s;upport. But if, by any means, you have been per|&s;unded to think that this poverty makes me le&s;s con|&s;idered in my own country, or in any degree unhappy, you are extremely deceived. I have no rea&s;on to complain of fortune, &s;he &s;upplies me with all that na|ture requires; and, if I am without &s;uper&s;luities, I am al&s;o free from the de&s;ire of them. With the&s;e, I con|fe&s;s, I &s;hould be more able to &s;uccour the nece&s;&s;itous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied; but as my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are, I can &s;till contri|bute &s;omething to the &s;upport of the &s;tate, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friends. With regard to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the riche&s;t: For Rome knows no qualifications for great employments but virtue and ability. She appoints me to officiate in the mo&s;t augu&s;t ceremonies of religion; &s;he entru&s;ts me with the command of her armies; &s;he con&s;ides to my care the mo&s;t important negotiations. My poverty does not le&s;len the weight and influence of my coun&s;els in the &s;enate, the Roman people honour me for that very poverty which you con&s;ider as a di&s;grace; they know the many oppor|tunities I have had in war to enrich my&s;elf without incurring cen&s;ure; they are convinced of my intere&s;ted zeal for their pro&s;perity; and, if I have any thing to complain of in the return they make, it is only in the exce&s;s of their applau&s;e. What value then can I &s;et upon your gold and &s;ilver! What king can add any thing to my fortune? Always attentive to di&s;charge the duties incumbent on me, I have a mind free from &s;elf-reproach, and I have an hone&s;t fame."</P>

<P>NOT far from this City lives a poor Tinker, who has educated &s;even &s;ons, all at this time in arms, and fighting for their country, and what reward do you think has the tinker from the &s;tate for &s;uch im|portant &s;ervices? none in the world; his &s;ons, when the war is over, may probably be whipt from pari&s;h to pari&s;h as vagabonds, and the old man, when pa&s;t la|bour, may die a pri&s;oner in &s;ome hou&s;e of correc|tion.</P>
<P>Such a worthy &s;ubject in China would be held in univer&s;al reverence; his &s;ervices would be rewarded, if not with dignities, at lea&s;t with an exemption from labour; he would take the left hand at &s;ea&s;ts, and mandarines them&s;elves would be proud to &s;hew their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The Engli&s;h laws puni&s;h vice, the Chine&s;e laws do more, they reward virtue!</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the little encouragements given to ma|trimony here, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the di&s;courage|ments given to propagation. Would you believe it, my dear Fum Hoam, there are laws made, which even forbid the people's marrying each other. By the head of Confucius, I je&s;t not; there are &s;uch laws in being here; and their law-givers have neither been in&s;tructed among the Hottentots, nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of Anamaboo.</P>
<P>There are laws which ordain, that no man &s;hall marry a woman contrary to her own con&s;ent. This, though contrary to what we are taught in A&s;ia, and though in &s;ome mea&s;ure a clog upon matrimony, I have no great objection to. There are laws which ordain, that no woman &s;hall marry again&s;t her father and mother's con&s;ent, unle&s;s arrived at an age of ma|turity; by which is under&s;tood tho&s;e years, when woman with us are generally pa&s;t child-bearing. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="258" REF="259">mu&s;t be a clog upon matrimony, as it is more difficult for the lover to plea&s;e three than one, and much more difficult to plea&s;e old people than young ones. The laws ordain, that the con&s;enting couple &s;hall take a long time to con&s;ider before they marry; this is a very great clog, becau&s;e people love to have all ra&s;h actions done in a hurry. It is ordained that all mar|riages &s;hall be proclaimed before celebration: this is a &s;evere clog, as many are a&s;hamed to have their mar|riage made public, from motives of vicious mode&s;ty, and many, afraid from views of temporal intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is ordained, that there is nothing &s;acred in the ceremony, but that it may be di&s;&s;olved to all intents and purpo&s;es by the authority of any civil magi&s;trate. And yet oppo&s;ite to this it is ordained, that the prie&s;t &s;hall be paid a large &s;um of money for granting his &s;acred permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my friend, that matrimony here is hedged round with &s;o many ob&s;tructions, that tho&s;e who are willing to break through or &s;urmount them, mu&s;t be contented, if at la&s;t they find it a bed of thorns. The laws are not to blame, for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could. It is indeed become a very &s;erious affair in England, and none but &s;erious people are generally found willing to engage. The young, the gay, and the beautiful, who have motives of pa&s;&s;ion only to induce them, are &s;eldom found to embark, as tho&s;e inducements are taken away, and none but the old, the ugly, and the mercenary are &s;een to unite, who, if they have any po&s;terity at all, will probably be an ill favoured race like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>What gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e laws might have been &s;ome &s;uch accidents as the&s;e. It &s;ometimes happened, that a mi&s;er, who had &s;pent all his youth in &s;eraping up money, to give his daughter &s;uch a fortune as might get her a mandarine hu&s;band found his expectations di&s;appointed at la&s;t, by her running away with his footman; this mu&s;t have been a &s;ad &s;hock to the poor
<PB N="259" REF="260">di&s;con&s;olate parent, to &s;ee his poor daughter in a one|hor&s;e chai&s;e, when he had de&s;igned her for a coach and &s;ix: what a &s;troke from providence!!! to &s;ee his dear money go to a beggar; all nature cried out at the profanation!!!</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happened al&s;o, that a lady, who had inherited all the titles, and all the nervous complaints of nobility, thought fit to impair her dignity, and mend her con&s;titution, by marrying a farmer; this mu&s;t have been a &s;ad &s;hock to her incon&s;olable rela|tions, to &s;ee &s;o fine a flower &s;natched from a flouri&s;h|ing family, and planted in a dunghill; this was an ab&s;olute inver&s;ion of the fir&s;t principles of things!!!</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent the great from be|ing thus contaminated by vulgar alliances, the ob&s;ta|cles to matrimony have been &s;o contrived, that the rich only can marry among&s;t the rich, and the poor, who would leave celebacy, mu&s;t be content to increa&s;e their poverty with a wife. Thus have the laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony; nature tells us, that beauty is the proper allurement of tho&s;e who are rich, and money of tho&s;e who are poor; but things here are &s;o contrived, that the rich are invited to marry by that fortune which they do not want, and the poor have no inducement, but that beauty which they do not feel.</P>
<P>An equal diffu&s;ion of riches through any country con&s;titutes its happine&s;s. Great wealth in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of one &s;tagnates, and extream poverty with ano|ther keeps him in unambitious indigence; but the moderately rich are generally active; not too far removed from poverty, to fear its calamities; nor too near extreme wealth, to &s;lacken the nerve of labour; they remain &s;till between both, in a &s;tate of continual fluctuation. How impolitic, therefore, are tho&s;e laws which promote the accumulation of wealth among the rich, more impolitic &s;till, in at|tempting to encrea&s;e the depre&s;&s;ion on poverty.</P>
<P>Bacon, the Engli&s;h Philo&s;opher, compares money
<PB N="260" REF="261">to manure; if gathered in heaps, &s;ays he, it does no good; on the contrary, it becomes offen&s;ive; but, being &s;pread, though never &s;o thinly, over the &s;ur|face of the earth, it enriches the whole country. Thus the wealth a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mu&s;t expatiate, or it is of no benefit to the public, it becomes rather a grievance, where matrimonial laws thus con&s;ine it to a few.</P>
<P>But this re&s;traint upon matrimonial community, even con&s;idered in a phy&s;ical light, is injurious. As tho&s;e who rear up animals take all po&s;&s;ible pains to cro&s;s the &s;train, in order to improve the breed; &s;o in tho&s;e countries where marriage is mo&s;t free, the inhabitants are found every age to improve in &s;tature and in beauty; on the contrary, where it is confined to a ca&s;t, a tribe, or an hord, as among the Gaurs, the Jews, or the Tartars, each divi&s;ion &s;oon a&s;&s;umes a family likene&s;s, and every tribe degenerates into peculiar deformity. From hence it may be ea&s;ily in|ferred, that if the Mandarines here are re&s;olved only to marry among each other, they will &s;oon produce a po&s;terity with Mandarine Faces: and we &s;hall &s;ee the heir of &s;ome honourable family &s;caree equal to the abortion of a country farmer.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the ob&s;tacles to marriage here, and it is certain they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered the end; for celebacy is both frequent and fa&s;hion|able. Old batchelors appear abroad without a ma&s;k, and old maids, my dear Fum Hoam, have been ab&s;o|lutely known to ogle. To confe&s;s in friend&s;hip, if I were an Engli&s;hman, I fancy I &s;hould be an old batchelor my&s;elf; I &s;hould never find courage to run through all the adventures pre&s;cribed by the law. I could &s;ubmit to court my mi&s;tre&s;s her&s;elf upon rea&s;onable terms, but to court her father, her mother, and a long tribe of cou&s;ins, aunts, and relations, and then &s;tand the butt of a whole country church, I would as &s;oon turn tail, and make love to her grand|mother.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">I can conceive no other rea&s;on for thus loading matrimony with &s;o many prohibitions, unle&s;s it be that the country was thought already too populous, and this was found to be the mo&s;t effectual means of thinning it. If this was the motive. I cannot but congratulate the wi&s;e projectors on the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme. Hail, O ye dim-&s;ighted politicians, ye weeders of men!

<Q>I al&s;o will &s;hew mine opinion.
<BIBL><HI>JOB xxxii. ver. 10.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD>THE RIGHTS OF MAN, BY QUESTION AND ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Q. WHAT is Man?</P>
<P>A. An irrational, un&s;ocial, cowardly, and covetous animal.</P>
<P>Q. How do you prove he is irrational?</P>
<P>A. His actions are as much influenced by pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts as are the actions of other ani|mals deemed irrational.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">Q. How is it that he is un&s;ocial?</P>
<P>A. His ridiculous pride makes him imagine him|&s;elf in an infinite variety of ways &s;uperior to others of his &s;pecies, and of cour&s;e too noble for every company.</P>
<P>Q. Give &s;ome in&s;tances?</P>
<P>A. Some prefer them&s;elves for being born of pa|rents in this or that &s;tation, or in &s;ome particular country, or for being more tall, hand&s;ome, &amp;c. and therefore refu&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate with their &s;uppo&s;ed in|feriors in the&s;e re&s;pects (excepting to &s;erve &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e), nor will they allow tho&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed people equal privileges.</P>
<P>Q. How do you make it appear, that man is a cowardly animal?</P>
<P>A. Becau&s;e he hunts in packs like hounds, the mo&s;t cowardly of all dogs. He &s;eldom attacks &s;ingly either his own or any other &s;pecies without manife&s;t &s;uperiority of &s;ituation or arms. When a company of them make a booty, they do not all boldly fall on to partake, each according to what his hunger or nece&s;&s;ity requires, but &s;neakingly keep at a di&s;tance, till the &s;tronge&s;t or mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous think proper to allow them to partake.</P>
<P>Q. Do the herds or companies of other animals be|have in the &s;ame timid manner to certain individuals among them?</P>
<P>A. By no means; they are not half &s;o complai&s;ant. A company of hounds or wolves will partake equally of their prey, or el&s;e they will fight for it, and wage eternal war till they gain their rights. A hungry bea&s;t will attempt again and again, whereas men have been frequently known to &s;tarve rather than help them&s;elves to the common provi&s;ions of nature monopolized by their arrogant fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>Q. Do we not frequently &s;ee a &s;triking difference in &s;leekne&s;s and fatne&s;s among a herd of cattle feed|ing together in the &s;ame pa&s;ture, owing to the pre|&s;umption of &s;ome of them driving away the weaker animals from their victuals?</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">A. No. None of them will &s;ubmit to &s;uffer thus far by others. The mo&s;t voracious and mi&s;chievous will only fill his own belly. And while he is &s;ight|ing and driving off one, another will have the a&s;|&s;urance to come in for a &s;hare, and thus, either by force or &s;tealth, they are &s;ure to partake pretty equally.</P>
<P>Q. Are not droves of hogs frequently &s;een pa&s;&s;ing through London of different appearance among them|&s;elves; &s;ome being hardly able to walk with fat, while others are like greyhounds for thinne&s;s?</P>
<P>A. No, never. Swine living together are all alike, either all fat or all lean.</P>
<P>Q. Are mankind living in the &s;ame neighbour|hood all of the &s;ame liking too?</P>
<P>A. No; very far from it. Some are like to hur&s;t with fat and &s;aticty, while others appear like &s;hadows, and frequently die of want, and di&s;|ea&s;es flowing from &s;carcity, or unwhol&s;ome diet.</P>
<P>Q. Did not Edmund Burke then very improperly term his &s;tarving fellow-creatures the Swini&s;h Multi|tude?</P>
<P>A. Yes, he therein blundered mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly. For on very flight ob&s;ervation, he would find real Swine to be more noble animals, and far from being &s;o ob&s;equeous. They will not quietly &s;uffer want on any account, much le&s;s by the encroachments of their fellow-creatures. If any great hog offer to thru&s;t them from the trough, they will &s;cream mo&s;t &s;edi|tiou&s;ly, and will, without regard to con&s;equence, in|&s;i&s;t on having their no&s;es in, on one &s;ide or the other. Be&s;ides, if men were like &s;wine, how would they be drilled into &s;oldiers? Could an army of hogs be di&s;ciplined and marched again&s;t another army of hogs? No, they are not &s;o fond of armour and trapping as to dance in them to their de&s;truction. They leave &s;uch &s;tupid bravery to the rational be|ing called Man. They do not under&s;tand &s;laying each other for ma&s;ters. They only know bravery in
<PB N="264" REF="265">per&s;i&s;ting in what they think tends to their own happine&s;s, and that they will mo&s;t ob&s;tinately do. Mr. Burke mu&s;t think of &s;ome other name for his filly brethren, for they will never have the &s;en&s;e or &s;pirit to defend their Rights and Intere&s;ts like Swine. &mdash;Thus much for the cowardline&s;s of mankind above other animals.</P>
<P>Q. Have men no other way of &s;hewing their pe|culiar meanne&s;s, than by tamely giving up their Rights to the fir&s;t u&s;urper?</P>
<P>A. Yes. By in&s;ulting decrepid individuals or &s;mall numbers of their own &s;pecies, when they are in company with other malicious beings like them|&s;elves. But this they never venture upon except emboldened by their numbers. No &s;ingle man could ever yet venture to be in&s;olent or witty upon another, without his own companions. As ob&s;erved before, they are like hounds&mdash;they always hunt in packs.</P>
<P>Q. How does it appear that men are covetous animals?</P>
<P>A. Nay, they are &s;o much &s;o, that this pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be the &s;ource of all their other bad quali|ties. Other animals only covet till their pre&s;ent ap|petite is &s;atisfied, and then leave the world in peace to others. But man is in&s;atiable. He is like the grave, he never &s;aith he hath enough.</P>
<P>Q. Does his covetou&s;ne&s;s induce him to take things not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to life, from his &s;pecies by force?</P>
<P>A. Yes: for the &s;ake of mere &s;uperfluities to hoard up, and which are of no manner of u&s;e but to look at, he will de&s;troy his fellow creatures in num|bers to the utmo&s;t of his power.</P>
<P>Q. He is a vicious, dangerous, and dete&s;table animal. Does he ever compel others of the &s;pecies to toil for him, in procuring him food and raiment, and tho&s;e &s;uperfluous articles which he covets?</P>
<P>A. Does he, aye. He was not long in the world
<PB N="265" REF="266">till he reduced his fellows to &s;lavery. He continues to do &s;o &s;till, and while the world la&s;ts he will con|tinue &s;uch inju&s;tice if the &s;pecies do not acquire more &s;pirit to re&s;i&s;t the u&s;urpations of each other. If there is not univer&s;al and individual &s;pirit to re&s;i&s;t univer&s;al and individual pre&s;umption and covetou&s;|ne&s;s, a great portion of men mu&s;t always be in &s;ub|jection to the a&s;&s;uming few. For mankind are not very likely to relinqui&s;h their inju&s;tice and avarice.</P>
<P>Q. What pity that they are not rational! For then might this univer&s;al inju&s;tice and covetou&s;ne&s;s &s;pur them on to invent &s;ome preventative again&s;t their common encroachments on the rights and properties of each other?</P>
<P>A. Certainly. A &s;mall portion of rea&s;on might &s;uffice for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. What are the &s;pecific rights of the animal called Man?</P>
<P>A. Though the &s;pecies, by their incon&s;i&s;tent be|haviour to each other, may rai&s;e doubts concerning their rationality, yet, by their &s;uperior form of body, and inventive powers of mind, they &s;eem qualified to turn all nature to their advantage, and may not im|properly be termed the Lords of the Creation. And the P&s;almi&s;t (P&s;al. viii. ver. 5.) &s;ays, <HI>God has made man but a little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour. Has made him to have do|minion over the works of his hands, and has put all things under his feet: All &s;heep and oxen, yea, and the bea&s;ts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fi&s;h of the &s;ea.</HI> Again, in P&s;al. cxv. ver. 16, it is &s;aid, <HI>The Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lord's:</HI> BUT THE EARTH HATH HE GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN.</P>
<P>Q. If then the earth be given to the children of men, what pity it is that they cannot agree on &s;ome equitable mode of enjoying their common property, and be content to live and let live, like other crea|tures?</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">A. Nothing &s;eems more ea&s;y than to devi&s;e &s;uch a mode, were men hone&s;t enough to be content with equality of rights and privileges.</P>
<P>Q. Whether &s;uch a plan may or may not be adopted, it ought to be pre&s;ented to them, and then they will be left without excu&s;e?</P>
<P>A. There is no more requi&s;ite to render mankind as happy as they can be on earth than &s;imply this: That the people in every di&s;trict or pari&s;h &s;hould appoint collectors to receive the rents, and divide them equally among them&s;elves, or apply them to what public u&s;es they may think proper.</P>
<P>Q. Can any tyranny or abu&s;es flow from &s;uch a principle?</P>
<P>A. No, none can exi&s;t where &s;uch a principle is adhered to.</P>
<P>Q. Ought every one to pay rent to tho&s;e col|lectors?</P>
<P>A, Every one &s;hould pay according to the full value of the premi&s;es which he occupied, whether farm, hou&s;e, or apartment.</P>
<P>Q. How would the value of tho&s;e tenements be known?</P>
<P>A. By letting them by public auction to the be&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>Q. For how long a term would the public pro|bably let their tenements?</P>
<P>A. For the life of the occupier, if he &s;o long make good his payments, that he might enjoy the fruits of any improvements he might make during his re|&s;idence.</P>
<P>Q. But what if an occupier or tenant &s;hould not make good his payments?</P>

<P>Q. Who would build and repair the hou&s;es, &amp;c.?</P>

<HEAD>A Compari&s;on between the AFRICAN SLAVES in the WEST INDIES, and the CELTIC SLAVE, or SCALLAG, in &s;ome of the HEBRIDES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Travels in the We&s;tern Hebrides, <HI>by the Rev.</HI> JOHN LANE BUCHANAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[<HI>Continued from page</HI> 125.]</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. With regard to the re&s;pective conditions of their life in general, it is in neither ca&s;e of their own chu&s;ing. The African is bereft of his freedom, and &s;old into &s;lavery by fraud and violence. The Hebre|dian Slave is, indeed, neither trapanned into &s;lavery by guile, nor compelled by phy&s;ical compul&s;ion; but he is drawn into it by a moral nece&s;&s;ity equally in|vincible,
<PB N="269" REF="270">by a train of circum&s;tances which are be|yond his power to controul, and which leave him no option, but either to &s;erve &s;ome <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> as a Scallag, or to protract a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence for &s;ome time in the fore&s;t, and near the uninhabited &s;ea &s;hores, where he may pick up &s;ome &s;hell fi&s;h, to peri&s;h at la&s;t, with his wife, perhaps, and little ones, with cold and hunger.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. With regard to labour. The Negro ge|nerally works only from &s;ix o'clock in the morning to &s;ix in the evening; and out of that time he has two complete hours for re&s;t and refre&s;hment. The Scallag is at work from four o'clock in the morning to eight, nine, and &s;ometimes ten at night.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. With regard to re&s;pite from labour. The Negro is allowed two days in the week for him&s;elf&mdash; &s;o is the Scallag: but the precepts of <HI>Religion</HI> allow the Scallag only one of the&s;e days to labour for his own maintenance.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. With regard to food. The Negro has a plentiful allowance of &s;uch common fare as is &s;ufficient for his &s;upport; be&s;ides his little &s;pot of land which he cultivates for him&s;elf on Saturday and Sunday, as well as in the evenings, after he has fini&s;hed his ma&s;|ter's work. The Scallag, when at hard labour for his ma&s;ter, is fed twice a day with water-gruel, or <HI>brochan,</HI> as it is called; or kail, or coleworts, with the addition of a barley cake or potatoes; and all this without &s;alt. But, for his family, and for him|&s;elf on Sundays, or when he is unable to work through bodily indi&s;po&s;ition, he has no other means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence than what he can rai&s;e for him&s;elf, by the labour of one day out of &s;even, from a &s;canty por|tion of cold and moori&s;h &s;oil&mdash;barley, potatoes, cole|worts, and perhaps a milch cow, or a couple of ewes, for giving milk to his infants; though if often hap|pens, that he is obliged to kill the&s;e <HI>hou&s;ehold gods,</HI> as it were, to prevent his family from &s;tarving. At certain &s;ea&s;ons he has fi&s;h in abundance, but this he
<PB N="270" REF="271">is, for the mo&s;t part, obliged to eat without bread, and often without &s;alt. The Negro, if he be tole|rably indu&s;trious, can afford on Saturdays and other holidays, with pepper-pot, a pig, or a turkey, and a cann of grog; nay, Negroes have been known to clear, be&s;ides many comforts for their own family, twenty, thirty, even forty pounds a year; &s;o that there is a fair probability that a Negro may, be ena|bled to gain the price of his liberty. But, of relief from bondage and woe the Scallag has not a &s;ingle ray of hope, on this &s;ide the grave.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. With regard to lodging and cloathing. The Negro is comfortably lodged, in a warm climate. The Scallag is very poorly cloathed, and &s;till more wretchedly lodged, in a cold one. And as the Ne|gro is provided by his ma&s;ter with bedding and body clothes, &s;o he is al&s;o furni&s;hed by him with the implements of hu&s;bandry. The Scallag, with &s;ticks and &s;ods, rears his own mi&s;erable hut, procures for him|&s;elf a few rags, either by what little flax or wool he can rai&s;e, or by the refu&s;e or coar&s;er part of the&s;e furni&s;hed by his ma&s;ter, and provides his own work|ing tools, as the &s;pade, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. With regard to u&s;age or treatment. The Slave is driven on to labour by &s;tripes: &s;o al&s;o is the Scallag; who is ever, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, formally tied up, as well as the Negro, to a &s;take, and &s;courged on the bare back. The owner of the Slave, it may be farther ob&s;erved, has a &s;trong intere&s;t in his welfare; for if he &s;hould become &s;ick or infirm, the ma&s;ter mu&s;t maintain him; or if he &s;hould die, the ma&s;ter mu&s;t &s;upply his place at a con&s;iderable expence. There is no &s;uch re&s;traint on the peevi&s;h humours or angry pa&s;&s;ions of a Hebredian laird or tack&s;man. The Scallag, under infirmity, di&s;ea&s;e, and old age, is &s;et adrift on the wide world, and begs his bread from door to door, and from i&s;land to i&s;land. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;upply the place of a Scallag, to be at any expence: for the frequent failure of
<PB N="271" REF="272">&s;ettlments affords but too many recruits to the wretch|ed otder of Scallags.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. As there is nothing &s;o natural as the love of liberty, and an aver&s;ion to re&s;traint and oppre&s;&s;ion, the Scallag, as well as the Negro, &s;ometimes attempts emancipation, by fleeing to the uninhabited parts of the country: though &s;uch attemps are not &s;o of|ten made by the Scallags after they are enured to &s;lavery, as when they feel them&s;elves on the verge of &s;inking into that dreadful and de&s;erted condition of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The only a&s;ylum for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the Long I&s;land is the King's Fore&s;t; where &s;everal are &s;hel|tered with their families and cattle for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on; where they live in caves and dens of the earth; and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without fire, on milk, the roots of the earth, and &s;hell fi&s;h. But in the winter &s;ea|&s;on, cold and famine drive them back again to &s;eek for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;helter under the &s;ame tyranny that had driven them to the fore&s;t. The Blue or other mountains afford the means of life to runaway-negroes (if they can e&s;cape the &s;earch of their ma&s;|ters), both &s;ummer and winter.</P>
<P>In the We&s;t Indies, no planter or captain of a ve&s;&s;el is allowed by the law of the Colonies, to kidnap, con|ceal, or keep any runaway &s;lave, or by any means to detain him from his ma&s;ter. Here al&s;o the compari|&s;on holds between the Slave and the Scallag. There is not a takc&s;man who will take or retain in his &s;er|vice, or on his land, either the Scallag or &s;ubte|nant of another ma&s;ter, without a written certificate from that ma&s;ter, that the Scallag or &s;ubtenant has a good character; and al&s;o, if he be otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied as to the character of the poor man, that his ma&s;ter is willing to part with him. For as the Coloni&s;ts by their laws, &s;o the Tack&s;men of the Hebrides, by their country regulations, have entered into a firm compact, that no one &s;hall harbour the &s;ubtenant or Scallag of another, who does not produce a proof
<PB N="272" REF="273">of his humble and unlimited obedience to his former ma&s;ter. And it is evident from rea&s;on, were it not proved by experience, that certificates are mo&s;t with|held when they are mo&s;t wanted. For no landlord who is known to be cruel to his people will ever give them certificates, becau&s;e in that ca&s;e they would all leave the tyrant, and &s;eek for milder treat|ment under &s;ome le&s;s &s;evere ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE OF DEPEN|DENCE ON THE MIND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> The Citizen of the World, <HI>by Dr. Gold&s;mith.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG many who have enforced the duty of Giving, I am &s;urprized there are none to incul|cate the ignominy of Receiving, to &s;hew that by every favour we accept, we in &s;ome mea&s;ure forfeit our native freedom, and that in a &s;tate of continual de|pendence on the genero&s;ity of others in a life of gra|dual deba&s;ement.</P>
<P>Were men taught to de&s;pi&s;e the receiving obliga|tions with the &s;ame force of rea&s;oning and declama|tion that they are in&s;tructed to confer them, we might
<PB N="275" REF="276">then &s;ee every per&s;on in &s;ociety filling up the requi|&s;ite duties of his &s;ituation with chearful indu&s;try, neither relaxed by hope, nor &s;ullen from di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>Every favour a man receives, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;inks him below his dignity, and in proportion to the value of the benefit, or the frequency of its ac|ceptance, he gives up &s;o much of his natural inde|pendence. He, therefore, who thrives upon the un|merited bounty of another, if he has any &s;en&s;ibility, &s;uffers the wor&s;t of &s;ervitude; the &s;hackled &s;lave may murmur with out reproach, but the humble dependent is taxed with ingratitude upon every &s;ymptom of di&s;|content; the one may rave round the walls of his cell, but the other lingers in all the &s;ilence of mental confinement. To encrea&s;e his di&s;tre&s;s, every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from ri&s;ing; till at la&s;t, ela&s;tic no longer, it &s;hapes it&s;elf to con&s;traint, and puts on ha|bitual &s;ervility.</P>
<P>It is thus with the feeling mind, but there are &s;ome who, born without any &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, receive favour after favour, and &s;till cringe for more, who accept the offer of genero&s;ity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit, and even make thanks for pa&s;t benefits an indirect petition for new; &s;uch, I grant, can &s;uffer no deba&s;ement from dependence, &s;ince they were originally as vile as was po&s;&s;ible to be; dependence degrades only the ingenuous, but leaves the &s;ordid mind in pri&s;tine meanne&s;s. In this man|ner, therefore, long continued genero&s;ity is mi&s;placed, or it is injurious; it either finds a man worthle&s;s, or it makes him &s;o; and true it is, that the per&s;on who is contented to be often obliged, ought not to have been obliged at all.</P>
<P>It is perhaps one of the &s;evere&s;t misfortunes of the great, that they are in general, obliged to live among men who&s;e real value is le&s;&s;ened by dependence, and who&s;e minds are en&s;laved by obligation. The hum|ble
<PB N="276" REF="277">companion may have at fir&s;t accepted patronage with generous views, but &s;oon he feels the mortifying influence of con&s;cious inferiority, by degrees he &s;inks into a flatterer, and from flartery at la&s;t degenerates into STUPID VENERATION. To remedy this, the great often di&s;mi&s;s their old dependents, and take new. Such changes are fal&s;ely imputed to levity, fal&s;ehood, or caprice, in the patron, &s;ince they may be more ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the client's gradual de|terioration, No, my &s;on, a life of independence is ge|nerally a life of virtue.

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> SWIFT'S SERMONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><HI>TEXT&mdash;Gal. vi. ver. 10.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>As we have therefore op|portunity, les us do good unto all men.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BUT, be&s;ide this love we owe to every man in his particular capacity under the title of neigh|bour, there is a duty of a more large and exten&s;ive nature incumbent on us; which is, our love to our neighbour in his public capacity, as he is a member of that great body the commonwealth; and this is u&s;ually called love of the public, and is a duty to which we are more &s;trictly obliged than even that of loving even our&s;elves; becau&s;e therein our&s;elves are
<PB N="277" REF="278">al&s;o contained, as well as all our neighbours, in one great body. This love of the public or of the com|monwealth, or love of our country, was in ancient times properly known by the name of <HI>virtue,</HI> becau&s;e it was the greate&s;t of all virtues, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain all virtues in it: and many great examples of this virtue are left us on record, &s;carcely to be believed, or even conceived, in &s;uch a ba&s;e, corrupted, wicked age as this we live in. In tho&s;e times it was common for men to &s;acrifice their lives for the good of their country, although they had neither hope or belief of future rewards; whereas, in our days, very few make the lea&s;t &s;cruple of &s;acrificing a whole nation, as well as their own &s;ouls, for a little pre&s;ent gain, which often hath been known to end in their own ruin in this world, as it certainly mu&s;t in that to come.</P>
<P>Have we not &s;een men, for the &s;ake of &s;ome petty employment, give up the very natural rights and li|berties of their country, and of mankind, in the ruin of which them&s;elves mu&s;t at la&s;t be involved? are not the&s;e corruptions gotten among the meane&s;t of our people, who, for a price of money, will give their votes at a venture, for the di&s;po&s;al of their own lives and fortunes, without con&s;idering whether it be to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t likely betray or to defend them?</P>
<P>But, if I were to produce only one in&s;tance of a hundred wherein we fail in this duty of loving our country, it would be an endle&s;s labour; and therefore I &s;hall not attempt it.</P>
<P>But here I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood: but the love of our country, I do not mean Loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature; and a man may be very loyal, in the common &s;en&s;e of the word, without one grain of public good at his heart. Witne&s;s this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that, &s;ince the beginning of the world, no nation upon earth ever &s;hewed (all circum&s;tances con&s;idered) &s;uch high con&s;tant marks of loyalty in all
<PB N="278" REF="279">their actions and behaviour, as we have done: and, at the &s;ame time, no people ever appeared more ut|terly void of what is called a public &s;pirit. When I &s;ay the people, I mean the bulk or ma&s;s of the peo|ple, for I have nothing to do with tho&s;e in power.</P>
<P>Therefore I &s;hall think my time not ill &s;pent, if I can per&s;uade mo&s;t or all of you who hear me, to &s;hew the love you have for your country, by endea|vouring, in your &s;everal &s;tations, to do all the pub|lic good you are able. For I am certainly per&s;uaded, that all our misfortunes ari&s;e from no other original cau&s;e than that general di&s;regard among us to the public welfare.</P>
<P>I therefore undertake to &s;hew you three things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there are few people &s;o weak or mean, who have it not &s;ometimes in their power to be u&s;e|ful to the public.</P>
<P>Secondly, That it is often in the power of the meane&s;t among mankind to do mi&s;chief to the pub|lic.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, That all wilful injuries done to the public are very great and aggravated &s;ins in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, there are few people &s;o weak or mean, who have it not &s;ometimes in their power to be u&s;e|ful to the public.</P>
<P>Solomon tells us of a poor wi&s;e man who &s;aved a city by his coun&s;el.

The very example of hone&s;ty and indu&s;try in a poor trade&s;man will &s;ometimes &s;pread through a neighbourhood, when others &s;ee how &s;ucce&s;sful he is, and thus &s;o many u&s;eful members are gained, for which the whole body of the public is the better.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF GOVERNMENT, AS REALLY OR FICTITIOUSLY FREE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By Dr.</HI> PRICE.</BYLINE>
<P>I Have ob&s;erved; that though, in a great &s;tate, all the individuals that compo&s;e it cannot be admitted to an immediate participation in the powers of legi&s;la|tion
<PB N="282" REF="283">and government, yet they may participate in the&s;e powers by a delegation of them to a body of repre&s;entatives.&mdash;In this ca&s;e it is evident that the &s;tate will be &s;till <HI>free</HI> or <HI>&s;elf-governed;</HI> and that it will be more or le&s;s &s;o in proportion as it is more or le&s;s fairly and adequately repre&s;ented. If the per&s;ons to whom the tru&s;t of government is committed, hold their places for &s;hort terms; if they are cho&s;en by the unbia&s;&s;ed voices of a majority of the &s;tate, and &s;ub|ject to their in&s;tructions; Liberty will be enjoyed in its highe&s;t degree. But if they are cho&s;en for long terms by a part only of the &s;tate; and if during that term they are &s;ubject to no controul from their consti|tuents; the very idea of liberty will be lo&s;t, and the power of chu&s;ing repre&s;entatives becomes nothing but a power, lodged in a <HI>few,</HI> to chu&s;e at certain pe|riods, a body of <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> for them&s;elves and for the re&s;t of the community. And if a &s;tate is &s;o &s;unk that the majority of its repre&s;entatives are elected by a handful of the meane&s;t per&s;ons in it, who&s;e voices are always paid for; and if al&s;o, there is a higher will on which even the&s;e mock repre&s;entatives them|&s;elves depend, and that directs their voices: in the&s;e circum&s;tances, it will be an abu&s;e of language to &s;ay that the &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es liberty. Private men, indeed, might be allowed the exerci&s;e of liberty; as they might al&s;o under the mo&s;t de&s;potic government; but it would be an <HI>indulgence</HI> or <HI>connivance</HI> derived from the &s;pirit of the times, or from an accidental mild|ne&s;s in the admini&s;tration. And, rather than be go|verned in &s;uch a manner, it would perhaps be better to be governed by the will of one man without any repre&s;entation: for a repre&s;entation &s;o degenerated could an&s;wer no other end than to mi&s;lead and de|ceive, by di&s;gui&s;ing &s;lavery, and keeping up a <HI>form</HI> of liberty when the <HI>reality</HI> was lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES ACCRUING TO MAN|KIND FROM A HABITUAL CONSCIOUS|NESS OF THEIR BEING EQUAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From</HI> Barlow's Advice to Privileged Orders.</HEAD>
<P>IN the United States of America, the Science of Li|berty is univer&s;ally under&s;tood, felt, and prac|ti&s;ed, as much by the &s;imple as the wi&s;e, the weak as the &s;trong. The deep-rooted and inveterate ha|bit of thinking, that <HI>all men are equal in their Rights,</HI> that <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible to make them otherwi&s;e;</HI> and this being their undi&s;turbed belief, they have no concep|tion how any man in his &s;en&s;es can entertain any other. This point once &s;ettled, every thing is &s;et|tled. Many operations, which in Europe have been con&s;idered as incredible tales or dangerous experi|ments, are but the infallible con&s;equences of this great principle. The fir&s;t of the&s;e operations is <HI>the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Election,</HI> which, with that people is carried on with as much gravity as their daily labour. There is no jealou&s;y on the occa&s;ion, nothing lucrative in office; any man in &s;ociety may attain to any place in the government, and may exerci&s;e its functions. They believe that there is nothing more difficult in the management of the affairs of a nation than the affairs of a family; that it only requires more hands. They believe that it is the juggle of keeping up im|po&s;itions to blind the eyes of the vulgar, that con|&s;titutes the intricacy of &s;tate. Bani&s;h the my&s;tici&s;m of inequality, and you bani&s;h almo&s;t all the evils attendant on human nature.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence of the habitual idea of Equality, is the <HI>facility of changing the &s;tructure of their Government</HI> whenever and as often as the Society &s;hall think there is any thing in it to amend. As
<PB N="284" REF="285">Mr. Burke has written no "Reflections on the Re|volution" in America, the people there have never been told that they had no <HI>right</HI> "to frame a go|vernment for them&s;elves;" they have therefore done much of this bu&s;ine&s;s, without ever affixing to it the idea of "Sacrilege," or "U&s;urpation," or any other term of rant to be found in that Gentleman's Voca|bulary.</P>
<P>Within a few years, the Fifteen States have not only framed each its own State-Con&s;titution, and Two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Federal Con&s;titutions; but &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the pre&s;ent general Government in the year 1789, three of the States, Penn&s;ylvania, South-Carolina, and Georgia, have totally new-modeled their own. And all this is done without the lea&s;t confu&s;ion; the operation being &s;carcely known be|yond the limits of the State where it is performed. Thus they are in the habit of <HI>"choo&s;ing their own Governors,"</HI> of <HI>"ca&s;hiering them for mi&s;conduct,"</HI> of <HI>"framing a Government for them&s;elves,"</HI> and all tho&s;e abominable things, the mere naming of which, in Mr. Burke's opinion, has polluted the pulpit in the Old Jewry.<NOTE N="&dtristar;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>SECOND VOLUME</HI> will be Publi&s;hed as the <HI>FIRST,</HI> namely, in <HI>PENNY NUMBERS</HI> Weekly.</NOTE></P>
