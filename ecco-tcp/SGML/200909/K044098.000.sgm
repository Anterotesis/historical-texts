<P>REMARKS UPON THE EIGHTH SECTION OF THE SECOND VOLUME OF MR. WARTON's <HI>Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry.</HI></P>
<Q>The Author is certainly at liberty to fancy ca&s;es, and make whatever compari&s;ons he thinks proper; his &s;uppo&s;itions &s;till continue as di&s;tant from fact, as his wild di&s;cour&s;es are from &s;olid argument.

<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Annual Regi&s;ter for 1778, Mr. Dod&s;ley has re&s;umed the &s;ubject of Rowlie's Poems. The whole of this &s;econd publication is taken, as he tells us, from Mr. Warton's Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry; who&s;e opinion, from his knowledge as an antiquarian, and judgment as a man of ta&s;te, he looks upon as deci&s;ive. The&s;e extracts made me de&s;irous of reading the whole &s;ection from which they were taken. I accordingly read it very care|fully; and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that the in|formation I gained from it, was by no means an&s;werable to what I had a right to expect from the reputed abilities and character of that author.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">The method the Profe&s;&s;or there lays down to him&s;elf is, to give us,</P>
<P>I&s;t. Some <HI>account of the manner in which Rowlie's Poems were brought to light.</HI> 2dly. Some <HI>&s;pecimens of them.</HI> He then adds his own opinion, viz. That Rowlie was not the author, that Chatterton was.</P>
<P>That Rowlie was not the author, he en|deavours to prove, 1&s;t, By external argu|ments; 2dly, By internal. Some levelled again&s;t the collection of Poems in ge|neral; others again&s;t particular pieces.</P>
<P>The external arguments are as follow: That <HI>the form of the letters e&s;&s;entially dif|fers from every one of our ancient manu&s;cripts;</HI> that <HI>the characters were not uniform;</HI> that <HI>care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow ca&s;t;</HI> that <HI>the parchments them&s;elves had been &s;tained with ocre, which was ea&s;ily rubbed off.</HI> The manu&s;cript too, <HI>which he had examined carefully him|&s;elf, bad,</HI> it &s;eems <HI>&s;ome heraldic delineations,</HI> not &s;uitable to the time, which confirm him &s;till more in his opinion.</P>
<P>The internal arguments are the&s;e: <HI>An affectation of ob&s;olete words and &s;pellings;
<PB N="5" REF="4">improper combinations of them, and improper contexture with the pre&s;ent modes of &s;peech.</HI> The incon&s;i&s;tency of the &s;tyle in different pieces; the con&s;i&s;tency, &s;pirit, and excel|lence of the collection in general.</P>
<P>The particular pieces who&s;e authen|ticity he que&s;tions, are, the Song to Aella, &amp;c. J. Lydgate's An&s;wer; Sir C. Bald|win; the Battle of Ha&s;tings; the Ac|counte of W. Canynge's Fea&s;t; the Epi&s;|tle prefixed to the Tragedy, and through that, the Tragedy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having now proved them, to his own &s;atisfaction at lea&s;t, not to be Rowlie's, he at once determines them to be Chat|terton's; whom he conceives to have been very capable of &s;uch an impo&s;ture, from his natural abilities and turn of di&s;po&s;i|tion; from his <HI>&s;ituation and connections;</HI> and from the little difficulty which &s;uch a forgery as this would be attended with.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I believe, are the chief grounds upon which our author argues, and as far as can be collected from a treati&s;e which is not always &s;o regular as it might have been, the amount of every thing he &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">Having thus given the reader this &s;hort view of the Profe&s;&s;or's arguments, I &s;hall now proceed to examine them particu|larly. As to the method ob&s;erved by me, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, that being entirely the Profe&s;&s;or's own.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, therefore, of the narration, or <HI>ac|count he gives of the manner in which the Poems were brought to light.</HI> How far this is di&s;tinct and clear, and agreeable to the general laws of narrative, it is not my pre|&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire. The accuracy of it, in regard to truth and fact, is all that comes under my notice; in which it certainly fails, at lea&s;t if credit is to be given to per&s;ons who have examined the matter on the &s;pot; with who&s;e accounts the Profe&s;&s;or does not always &s;eem to agree. Sometimes the difference be|tween them is trifling; &s;uch as calling the wooden che&s;t an <HI>iron</HI> one, &amp;c. and indeed would hardly be worth mention|ing, were they not proofs that the Pro|fe&s;&s;or had never been at Bri&s;tol, though I believe he was once within &s;ixteen miles of it. The age of Chatterton is a very
<PB N="7" REF="6">material circum&s;tance; he is &s;aid by the Profe&s;&s;or to have been <HI>about &s;eventeen</HI> when the Poems were di&s;covered; but as he was born at the latter end of 1752, and the Poems were di&s;covered at late&s;t in the autumn of 1768, he could not then have been quite-&s;ixteen. The difference of this year will be of more importance than appears at fir&s;t &s;ight, when we con&s;ider that he was not known as an author till after fifteen, the time at which he left &s;chool, where his nece&s;&s;ary employment was &s;uch, that he could hardly have much lei&s;ure for other &s;tu|dies.</P>
<P>As to the Profe&s;&s;or's <HI>&s;pecimens of the&s;e Poems;</HI> whatever his judgment in &s;elect|ing them may have been, accuracy in tran&s;cribing them &s;eems to be what he has very little attended to. For in&s;tance, the de&s;cription of the morning, which is a&s;cribed by him to the min&s;trels, is a part of Celmonde's &s;peech after the victory at Watchet. In the <HI>Chorus or interlude of the dam&s;el who drowns her&s;elf,</HI> &s;carce one line agrees with the printed copy. The Song to Aella he tran&s;cribes at length;
<PB N="8" REF="7">John Lydgate's An&s;wer he determines to be <HI>beneath tran&s;cription;</HI> but that it may not pa&s;s wholly unnoticed, he gives us a long note to prove it a forgery. This ar|gument has certainly the appearance of being mi&s;placed; but it is to be pre&s;um|ed, that the Profe&s;&s;or had his rea&s;ons for it. This parchment which contained the Song to Aella, J. Lydgate's An&s;wer, and the introductory letter, was one of the very few that Chatterton ever pro|duced as originals. The rea&s;ons for which its authenticity is doubted by the Profe&s;&s;or, are the&s;e: That <HI>Turgotus and Chaucer are both &s;aid to have lived in Norman times;</HI> which, as he rightly ob|&s;erves, might be true of Turgotus, who died in 1115, but could not be equally applied to Chaucer, who was nearly co|temporary with Lydgate. Perhaps in tho&s;e times, the particle <HI>"and"</HI> might not connect &s;o &s;trongly as it does at pre&s;ent; and Turgot may be joined with Chau|cer only as referring to his excellence, and not to the time in which he lived. But &s;uppo&s;ing this remark to be ju&s;t, it will as well prove that Chatterton did not
<PB N="9" REF="8">write it, as that Lydgate did not; his antiquarian knowledge, according to the Profe&s;&s;or, being &s;uch as mu&s;t have in|formed him better. Be&s;ides, Chaucer was his favourite author, who&s;e glo&s;&s;ary he continually con&s;ulted. It is therefore very near as improbable that &s;uch an ana|chroni&s;m &s;hould come from him, as from Lydgate him&s;elf. The Profe&s;&s;or's next remark is, that Chaucer and Turgot <HI>are oddly coupled in another re&s;pect,</HI> as the latter <HI>only wrote &s;ome Latin Chronicles.</HI> Now Turgot wrote not in Latin, but, in his mother-tongue, according to Bale; nor were his works, by the &s;ame author's account, entirely hi&s;torical. It is urged likewi&s;e by the Profe&s;&s;or, as another ob|jection, <HI>that Stowe is mentioned as living with Chaucer and Turgot. This Stowe,</HI> he &s;ays, to &s;hew his learning where rea|&s;ons only are wanted, <HI>&s;hould be Stone, who was Lydgate's cotemporary. That this Stowe &s;hould be Stone</HI> is very probable, as the letters <HI>n</HI> and <HI>w</HI> were &s;o alike in this very parchment, that Chatterton read the author's name Ronlie, till he was &s;et
<PB N="10" REF="9">right by Mr. Barret. As to the other a&s;&s;ertion of the Profe&s;&s;or's, that Stowe <HI>is mentioned as living with Chaucer and Tur|got,</HI> the words upon which he founds it, are,
<Q><L>In Norman times Turgotus, and</L>
<L>Great Chaucer did excell,</L>
<L>Then Stowe, the Bri&s;tol Carmelyte, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Whether this does not mean directly the contrary to what the Profe&s;&s;or &s;ays it does, I &s;hall leave to the reader to deter|mine. The Profe&s;&s;or's la&s;t argument again&s;t this piece, is <HI>the extreme and af|fected meanne&s;s of the compo&s;ition.</HI> The word <HI>affected</HI> is mo&s;t probably here foi&s;ted in, to avoid the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing this Poem, and the Song to Aella, the &s;erious productions of the &s;ame per&s;on. Whe|ther the meanne&s;s of any compo&s;ition can be admitted of as a conclu&s;ive proof that it is forged, may ju&s;tly be doubted; but the Profe&s;&s;or would have done well to have con&s;idered the con&s;equences fully, before he ri&s;qued &s;o dangerous a doc|trine. But to return to the extracts;
<PB N="11" REF="10">where, among others, he cites a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>a dialogue between two ladies</HI> (viz. a &s;oliloquy of one gentleman). This cir|cum&s;tance is of little or no weight on either &s;ide; and I have only mentioned it to exemplify what he him&s;elf con|fe&s;&s;es, that his quotations are not always &s;o accurate as they might have been.</P>
<P>Having thus prepared his readers for his opinion, he accordingly gives it, and very deci&s;ively, viz. <HI>That none of the&s;e pieces are genuine.</HI> This he re&s;ts upon the following circum&s;tances; which are, I pre&s;ume, his external arguments. Among the&s;e, the fir&s;t is, that Sir Charles Bawdin <HI>is allowed to be modern, even by tho&s;e who maintain all the others to be an|cient.</HI> In all the enquiries I have been able to make, I never yet found any body who allowed this. Who they were who did allow it, and of what authority, I could wi&s;h the Profe&s;&s;or had told us; at pre&s;ent, his proof cannot be of any great weight with tho&s;e who are not already pre-determined to grant that the Poem is modern. His note upon the pa&s;&s;age cer|tainly
<PB N="12" REF="11">does not carry much conviction. What is there contained (although, doubt|le&s;s, very curious) being in general but little to the purpo&s;e; what there is to the purpo&s;e, rather in favour of the Poem than the contrary.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or's next objections are drawn from the parchment which con|tained the Song to Aella and J. Lyd|gate's An&s;wer, viz. That <HI>the writing was a gro&s;s and palpable forgery, not even &s;kil|fully counterfeited;</HI> that <HI>the letters, though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance, differed from all our ancient al|phabets;</HI> that <HI>they were not uniform;</HI> that <HI>the parchment had been &s;tained with ocre, which was ea&s;ily rubbed off;</HI> and that <HI>care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow ca&s;t.</HI> Part of this would, if clearly proved, have great weight with many. However, this does not re&s;t, it &s;eems, upon the Profe&s;&s;or's authority, but upon his friend's. Perhaps it is not quite fair in him to bring &s;uch very po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions about manu&s;cripts, which can|not now be referred to, as they are, to
<PB N="13" REF="12">u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>unfortunately lo&s;t.</HI> The manner of their lo&s;s was too, as I have heard, extraordinary. This the Profe&s;&s;or &s;ays nothing of; whether his friend had been tender of giving him any information on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, or whether he thought it might injure his cau&s;e, and has therefore &s;lurred it over, it matters not; we mu&s;t lament, and not enquire. As to their being <HI>&s;tained with ocre;</HI> I have heard from the be&s;t autho|rity, that one of the manu&s;cripts was not &s;tained with ocre, at lea&s;t when it left Bri&s;tol; the yellow roll, as the name im|plies, was originally &s;tained for di&s;tinction &s;ake: nor, if there had been any &s;uch &s;tain upon the fir&s;t, would it have proved it modern. As <HI>from &s;ome notices I have received</HI> (to u&s;e the Profe&s;&s;or's own cla&s;|&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>I find,</HI> that mo&s;t of the parchments in many archives throughout the kingdom, have a &s;ort of yellow du&s;t upon them; which the converting fancy of an <HI>ingenious critic</HI> might, e&s;pecially if inclined before to do &s;o, ea&s;ily mi&s;inter|pret into ocre. As to the ink; I do not
<PB N="14" REF="13">mean to undervalue the abilities of the Profe&s;&s;or's friend; it mu&s;t, however, re|quire a greater degree of &s;agacity than I can well conceive, to determine exactly whether the <HI>yellow ca&s;t</HI> of the ink was the effect of time, or accident, or art. But after all, to what purpo&s;e all this? it is &s;urely unnece&s;&s;ary; for if the Profe&s;&s;or's word may be taken, he <HI>has already proved Lydgate's an&s;wer, which was on the &s;ame parchment, and apparently in the &s;ame hand, a manife&s;t impo&s;ition.</HI> What I have above hinted in regard to this &s;ame note, will, I hope, make the reader a little &s;crupu|lous how he receives any thing from the Profe&s;&s;or as an unque&s;tionable truth, till he &s;hall have examined it him&s;elf pretty carefully, at lea&s;t put him &s;o far upon his guard as not to take any thing at the Profe&s;&s;or's hands intirely upon tru&s;t.</P>
<P>But the Profe&s;&s;or, not willing to leave the glory of &s;o great a di&s;covery entirely to his friend, and to put things out of all doubt, acquaints us, that his own exami|nation of the parchment containing the account of W. Canynge's Fea&s;t, confirms,
<PB N="15" REF="14">very fully, all that he has told us of the two other parchments on the authority of his friend. This parchment, he &s;ays, with an appearance of &s;orrow, <HI>betrayed all the &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances ob&s;erved in the Ode to Aella.</HI> One would imagine, that here at lea&s;t he mu&s;t have been uncom|monly accurate, having, by all accounts, had the manu&s;cript in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion long enough of all con&s;cience to have made him&s;elf thoroughly ma&s;ter of it. But I never heard any one, except him&s;elf, &s;ay that <HI>it was &s;tained with ocre, or that care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow ca&s;t.</HI> As to the difference of the hand-writing from that of the age; that, even &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true, will not, I apprehend, be looked upon by every one as a deci&s;ive proof, till the ne|ce&s;&s;ity that all cotemporary writers &s;hould write the &s;ame hand, is made to appear. <HI>Even the &s;tyle and drawing of the armorial bearings,</HI> are &s;aid by the Profe&s;&s;or, <HI>to di&s;|cover the hand of a modern herald.</HI> As to the&s;e, from all I have been able to learn, they are not reducible to any &s;ort of he|raldry
<PB N="16" REF="15">that ever was. But that I may not &s;eem to take a malicious plea&s;ure in di&s;puting every thing he a&s;&s;erts, and ac|cepting and availing my&s;elf of tho&s;e con|ce&s;&s;ions which he &s;o generou&s;ly makes, without making him any in return, I will, if he plea&s;es, give him up this piece. Perhaps it may be a forgery; there are more rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o of this than of any other, but the Profe&s;&s;or &s;eems not to have hit upon them. The remark with which he concludes the&s;e external arguments, is rather unfortunate. He <HI>believes,</HI> it &s;eems, that this Accounte of W. Canynge's Fea&s;t, <HI>is the only pretended original of Rowlie's poetry now remaining.</HI> To talk in &s;o very heedle&s;s a manner, is hardly u&s;ing his readers fairly. The lea&s;t attention to the point in hand, even once reading over the Poem, might have &s;hewn him, that Canynge, and not Row|lie, was the reputed author of it.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed his external evi|dence, he proceeds, &s;econdly, to the in|ternal. His fir&s;t proof here is, <HI>the unna|tural affectation of ancient &s;pelling and ob|&s;olete
<PB N="17" REF="16">words, not belonging to the period a&s;|&s;igned the&s;e Poems; which,</HI> according to him, <HI>mu&s;t &s;trike us at fir&s;t &s;ight.</HI> What he means by <HI>not belonging to the period a&s;|&s;igned the&s;e Poems,</HI> does not, I own, im|mediately &s;trike me. Does he mean that they belong to any period before Rowlie's time? or any &s;ub&s;equent one? or does he intend to hint by the&s;e words, what Mr. Tyrwhitt has told us, that many of them are not to be found anywhere? Whichever is his meaning, he has ex|pre&s;t it rather ob&s;curely; but at all events he might certainly have avoided this, with little trouble to him&s;elf, and much &s;atisfaction to his readers, by citing &s;ome in&s;tances. His next mark of forgery is, that <HI>combinations of the&s;e old words are formed, which never yet exi&s;ted in the unpo|li&s;hed &s;tate of the Engli&s;h language.</HI> That <HI>the antiquated diction is often inartificially mi&s;applied by an improper contexture of the pre&s;ent modes of &s;peech.</HI> Here again, as I have ob&s;erved ju&s;t now, it were to be wi&s;hed, that the Profe&s;&s;or had given us &s;ome in&s;tances. It would have &s;aved me,
<PB N="18" REF="17">and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome others, much trouble. For my own part, I have &s;earched, and with &s;ome diligence, for the&s;e <HI>contextures and combinations,</HI> but hitherto with little &s;ucce&s;s. But, what is of more impor|tance, <HI>the poet &s;ometimes forgets his a&s;&s;umed character, and does not always act his part with con&s;i&s;tency, for the Interlude of the dam&s;el who drowns her&s;elf, is much more intelligible, and free from uncouth expre&s;&s;ions, than the general phra&s;eology of the&s;e compo|&s;itions.</HI> This may be ea&s;ily accounted for by the genius of elegiac poetry, which is naturally &s;imple and unaffected. There is, however, another way of accounting for this difference, more deci&s;ive, though le&s;s obvious; which is, that the Profe&s;&s;or &s;eems to have modernized it in no le&s;s than forty-eight places; which one would imagine was not &s;o very ea&s;y a ta&s;k, as the whole Poem con&s;i&s;ts only of nine &s;tanzas. Many of his other quotations are inaccurate, as he him&s;elf rightly ob|&s;erves, but none &s;o much as this. In other parts, his alterations &s;eem to give the words a more antiquated ca&s;t. In the
<PB N="19" REF="18">Poem before us, this would have defeated the end he had in view, the modern ap|pearance of the Poem being what he founds his objection upon.</P>
<P>Having now gone through (as I ima|gined at lea&s;t, for I found my&s;elf mi&s;tak|en, as the reader will &s;ee very &s;hortly) his general proofs, he comes to particular pieces, v. g. <HI>In the battle of Ha&s;tings, Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple. But about Turgot's time,</HI> according to the Profe&s;&s;or, <HI>no other report prevailed about this miraculous monument, than that it was erected in memory of Hengi&s;t's ma&s;&s;acre. This,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>was the e&s;tabli&s;hed and uni|form opinion of the Welch and Armorican bards, who had it from the Saxon min&s;trels. That the Druids con&s;tructed this &s;tupendous pile for a place of wor&s;hip, was a di&s;covery re&s;erved for the &s;agacity of a wi&s;er age, and the laborious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of modern antiqua|ries.</HI> Let us examine a little upon what foundation this great traditional authority is built. We have it from the Profe&s;&s;or, whom we certainly have not too much rea&s;on to give implicit credit to&mdash;who
<PB N="20" REF="19">had it from Geoffry of Monmouth, who&s;e romance is nothing more than a collec|tion of mere fables&mdash;who had it from the Armorican bards, none of who&s;e works are now extant, if ever there were any&mdash; who had it from the Saxon min&s;trels, who, I believe, were never extant at all. So that this tradition has its original no|where&mdash;is tran&s;mitted by people who&s;e te&s;timony does not exi&s;t&mdash;confirmed by one of the mo&s;t notorious liars that ever lived, and the la&s;t &s;tamp put to its au|thenticity by the Profe&s;&s;or. What in|fidels mu&s;t we be, who do not &s;ubmit to &s;uch irrefragable evidence! But &s;uppo&s;ing this was the common report, which by no means appears, is it impo&s;&s;ible that a man of learning &s;hould have known the truth, though contrary to common re|port. He mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have had better materials &s;o much nearer the times, than our <HI>modern antiquaries,</HI> who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t authors of this di&s;covery, and perhaps as much <HI>&s;agacity</HI> to have made u&s;e of them. His next proof is from the Epi&s;tle to Lydgate (meaning, I
<PB N="21" REF="20">&s;uppo&s;e, the Epi&s;tle to Canynge) in which, he &s;ays, <HI>&s;ome great &s;tory of human manners</HI> is recommended as the &s;ubject <HI>mo&s;t &s;uitable for theatrical repre&s;entation. This idea,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>is the re&s;ult of that ta&s;te and di&s;crimination, which could only belong to a more advanced period of &s;ociety.</HI> Sup|po&s;ing this quotation was in Rowlie's words, which it is not, what direct proof again&s;t the tragedy's being ancient can be built upon it? Is it improbable, that a man of ta&s;te &s;hould be di&s;gu&s;ted at the ab&s;urdity of the dramatical repre&s;enta|tions, which u&s;ually prevailed in the age when this was &s;uppo&s;ed to be written? That his genius, ta&s;te, or learning, &s;hould point out to him the proper object of dramatic poetry?&mdash;The efforts of genius have not always kept exact pace with the &s;tate of &s;ociety; as at &s;ome times they have followed it but &s;lowly, &s;o at others they have advanced beyond it. This argument is &s;econded by a long note, which, however, contains nothing more than &s;ome cavils upon two or three words; viz, that by <HI>min&s;ter</HI> mu&s;t be meant <HI>the
<PB N="22" REF="21">pre&s;ent cathedral at Bri&s;tol;</HI> that <HI>Bri&s;tol is called a city,</HI> which it was not till 150 years after Rowlie and that <HI>Accounte in his time had not lo&s;t its original &s;en&s;e and &s;pelling.</HI> But in fact, St. Ewin's church at Bri&s;tol was anciently called the min&s;ter, and not the pre&s;ent cathedral, However, let us grant that it was the pre|&s;ent cathedral. The pre&s;ent cathedral was, at that time, an Augu&s;tine mona|&s;tery, according to the Profe&s;&s;or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this very note.</NOTE>, and min&s;ter is, by the &s;ame authority<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the additions and emendations upon this note.</NOTE>, &s;aid, <HI>in its &s;imple acceptation to &s;ignify mona&s;tery.</HI> So, that if it was called min&s;ter, it was called by its right name. The &s;econd word is in the pro&s;e writings, where much is very probably interpolated, and about which I never could get any in|formation I could depend upon. The Account of W. Canynge's Fea&s;t, as I have before hinted, and &s;hall &s;hew by and by, is much to be &s;u&s;pected; to be &s;u&s;pected in many particulars, and mo&s;t in the title.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">But, to follow the Profe&s;&s;or back to his general arguments, and, to u&s;e his own very expre&s;&s;ive words, <HI>Above all, the ca&s;t of the thought, the complexion of the &s;entiment, and the &s;tructure of the compo&s;ition, evidently prove the&s;e pieces not ancient. The Ode to AElla,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>has exactly the air of modern poetry, &s;uch as is written at this day, only di&s;gui&s;ed with antique &s;pelling, and phra&s;e|ology.</HI> But if this be really the Profe&s;&s;or's opinion, he mu&s;t have been peculiarly fortunate, as very few things which have been publi&s;hed lately, or perhaps at any time, can &s;tand in competition with them. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Poems are &s;uperior to modern ones, even that can hardly prove them forgeries. Many writers of un|doubted authority, differ much in &s;tyle from their cotemporaries. Terence and Plautus, who wrote in the &s;ame way, as well as in the &s;ame age, are as different in point of &s;tyle, as any two writers who lived in different ages could have been. A &s;imilar in&s;tance occurs among our own authors. Bi&s;hop Hall's Virgidemiae were, I believe, publi&s;hed before Dr.
<PB N="24" REF="23">Donne's Satires. The difference between them, when con&s;idered as cotemporary writers, is a&s;toni&s;hing; as great, certainly, as between Rowlie and Lydgate, or any other, that lived either at or near tho&s;e times. No po&s;itive conclu&s;ion can, there|fore, be drawn from this kind of objec|tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I believe, are all the internal ar|guments which the Profe&s;&s;or has vouch|&s;afed to give us; and of the&s;e, few &s;eem to make good the point they are de&s;igned for, much fewer to be of the lea&s;t im|portance. Objections of weight &s;eem to have been left purpo&s;ely un&s;upported, either by argument, or in&s;tance. How|ever <HI>high</HI> the Profe&s;&s;or's <HI>authority</HI> may be, to have his bare a&s;&s;ertions taken for proof, is a <HI>greater deference</HI> than he can rea&s;on|ably expect.</P>
<P>Having thus proved, to his own &s;ati&s;|faction, that Rowlie is not the author of the&s;e Poems, he at once a&s;cribes them to Chatterton; whom he repre&s;ents as <HI>a pro|digy of genius,</HI> of &s;uch talents for poetry, that <HI>he would have proved the fir&s;t of Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="25" REF="24">poets, had he reached a maturer age.</HI> Whoever will read the Poems publi&s;hed in his name, may, perhaps, doubt this very extraordinary account of his abili|ties. There cannot, in my opinion, be any two collections of Poems more e&s;&s;en|tially different than Chatterton's and Rowlie's. The former have every im|perfection one might expect from the author's age; and excel in tho&s;e points only, which are more within the reach of a boy. His ver&s;es generally flow off in exact cadence and harmony; &s;ometimes the thoughts are better expre&s;t than any one rea&s;onably could have expected. But if any one looks for the propriety, con|&s;i&s;tency, conduct, and &s;pirit of Rowlie, he will be much di&s;appointed. Where does Chatterton ob&s;erve any one of the rules of good writing? Where does Rowlie fail in one? In &s;hort, whatever has been &s;aid by the Profe&s;&s;or upon the inequality and impropriety of the <HI>old Engli&s;h bards,</HI> may be applied with much more ju&s;tice to Chatterton. What <HI>his early compo&s;itions, written without any de|&s;ign
<PB N="26" REF="25">to deceive,</HI> were, which <HI>the fir&s;t critic of the pre&s;ent age</HI> &s;peaks &s;o highly of, I do not know, any more than who <HI>this fir&s;t critic</HI> is. Nor is it, in my opinion, quite fair of the Profe&s;&s;or to give &s;o very ex|traordinary a character of the&s;e Poems, without &s;pecifying which of them they are, or giving us &s;ome <HI>&s;pecimens of them,</HI> any more than to overbear us with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;|tible authority; without letting us know who this fir&s;t-rate critic is; this image which he has &s;et up for us all to bow down to. If, however, tho&s;e Poems the Profe&s;&s;or means, are in the above-men|tioned collection, I cannot pay &s;o much <HI>deference</HI> to this anonymous critic, or even to the Profe&s;&s;or him&s;elf, as to <HI>pro|nounce</HI> them &s;o very <HI>wonderful.</HI> There are certainly marks of genius in them, far beyond his education; but I cannot &s;ay that I have yet met with any thing which promi&s;es to make him <HI>the fir&s;t of Engli&s;h poets.</HI> That <HI>by his &s;ituation and connections he was a &s;kilful practitioner in various kinds of hand-writing,</HI> will be found, perhaps, on inquiry, a mere &s;up|po&s;ition
<PB N="27" REF="26">of the Profe&s;&s;or's. By better au|thority than the Profe&s;&s;or's, viz. the au|thority of tho&s;e who taught him, his common hand was a bad one, and he wrote very &s;low, or, in the Profe&s;&s;or's words, had but little <HI>facility in the gra|phic art.</HI> The attorney to whom he was articled, never employed him, except in writing precedents. From the&s;e circum|&s;tances it cannot but be evident, that the Profe&s;&s;or had not &s;ufficient grounds for this a&s;&s;ertion. In regard <HI>to a &s;ufficient quantity of ob&s;olete words and phra&s;es,</HI> tho&s;e, according to the Profe&s;&s;or, <HI>were readily attainable from the Glo&s;&s;ary to Chaucer, and Percy's Ballads.</HI> As for Percy, per|haps, it is barely worth remarking, that very few of the words u&s;ed by Rowlie (I que&s;tion if ten) are to be met with in that glo&s;&s;ary. As to Chaucer, the edi|tion Chatterton had, was, if I remember, the very fir&s;t that had a glo&s;&s;ary to it, which is &s;horter almo&s;t by half than any other, and does not contain a fifth part &s;o much as the glo&s;&s;ary to the la&s;t edi|tion. Now &s;urely this mu&s;t have been
<PB N="28" REF="27">a very poor help for any one, much le&s;s a &s;ufficient means to have enabled one of his age, his education, and, in many other re&s;pects, circum&s;tanced as he was, to write &s;uch poems, and to &s;uch a num|ber, as the&s;e called Rowlie's.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or, plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of this la&s;t argument, makes us, with all the &s;ecurity of a conqueror, a kind of in|&s;ulting conce&s;&s;ion; and allows, that <HI>&s;ome poems written by Rowlie might have been pre&s;erved in Canynge's che&s;t;</HI> but &s;ays, that <HI>if there were any, they were &s;o enlarged and improved by Chatterton, as to become en|tirely new compo&s;itions.</HI> What alterations can have &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing an effect as to make a tran&s;cript an original, is, I own, above my comprehen&s;ion. That Chatterton did corrupt many words, and modernize others, is very certain; and the gro&s;s mi&s;takes in many of his explications, have &s;ince been di&s;covered. Which mi&s;takes are &s;uch as he could never po&s;&s;ibly have committed, had he been the author, and followed his glo&s;&s;ary. The Profe&s;&s;or being tired of conce&s;&s;ion, returns again to
<PB N="29" REF="28">his old way, of taking it for granted that he has proved things before he has made any advances towards it. The account of W. Canynge's Fea&s;t, <HI>bids,</HI> he tells us, <HI>the faire&s;t for an original; this he has al|ready proved a forgery.</HI> In an&s;wer to this, I hope I may, without the imputation of acting too much like the Profe&s;&s;or, beg leave to &s;u&s;pend my a&s;&s;ent in regard to both the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. This poem would be &s;afe enough, if the Profe&s;&s;or's objec|tions were all that could be brought again&s;t its authenticity; but there are other circum&s;tances which may give us room to &s;u&s;pect its not being genuine. It is very &s;hort, there is little poetical merit in it, very little beyond Chatter|ton's abilities; and Mr. Walpole had &s;ugge&s;ted to him the idea of forgery, and &s;hewn him that he might pa&s;s for the au|thor, by doubting the authenticity of the other manu&s;cripts. But what with me is above all, it has not been <HI>unfortunately lo&s;t,</HI> as two, which were thought by &s;ome of the be&s;t judges, unque&s;tionable origi|nals, have been. But <HI>that this circum|&s;tance
<PB N="30" REF="29">is alone &s;ufficient to make us &s;u&s;pect, that no originals ever exi&s;ted,</HI> is more than can be granted. The proofs that even this manu&s;cript is a forgery, are by no means inconte&s;table; nor if they were, would it follow of cour&s;e, that all or any of the other manu&s;cripts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o too.</P>
<P>As to the motives which the Profe&s;&s;or a&s;&s;igns for &s;uch an impo&s;ture; the&s;e are as extraordinary as his proof of it, viz. fir&s;t, <HI>Lucrative views.</HI> This I &s;hould appre|hend could hardly have been the ca&s;e; as, if I remember right, he communicated the two fir&s;t manu&s;cripts without receiv|ing any thing for them; and the &s;ums which he received for the others, were by all accounts &s;o &s;mall, that he probably got more by the meane&s;t of tho&s;e he &s;ent to the magazines. As to <HI>the plea&s;ure of deceiving the world,</HI> which is the next motive our Profe&s;&s;or a&s;&s;igns; that is what I have no idea of. I do not mean from thence to argue, that it is by any means impo&s;&s;ible; upon farther con&s;ideration, it &s;eems not wholly improbable, and per|haps
<PB N="31" REF="30">may be thought to have had its in|fluence with writers of greater repute than Chatterton. That he &s;hould have <HI>preferred the private &s;ucce&s;s of his impo&s;ture, to the vanity of appearing as an applauded original author,</HI> is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with his general character. It being well known, that he never publi&s;hed any thing which he did not &s;end an account of to all his friends; and he never owned to any of them, that what he had produced under the name of Rowlie, was an im|po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or's thoughts &s;eem &s;o in|tirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with his hero, Chatterton, that I own I am &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to find him returning &s;o &s;uddenly to Rowlie; and ob&s;erving, that <HI>in the notices which &s;ome of the chief patrons of Rowlie's Poetry &s;ent him from Bri&s;tol, it was affirmed,</HI> that the order for the vi&s;itation of the che&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the che&s;t from which Chatterton con&s;tantly &s;aid he had taken the poems. It was de|po&s;ited by Canynge's order in a muniment room in Redcliffe church, and was to be &s;olemnly vi&s;ited every year.</NOTE>
<PB N="32" REF="31">we have before had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of, was in <HI>Canynge's will;</HI> where, as he rightly ob&s;erves, there is no &s;uch order to be found. I am afraid there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take about the&s;e no|tices. Every body who has been at Bri&s;tol mu&s;t know, and the Profe&s;&s;or, if he had given him&s;elf the trouble to have gone thither, might have known, that it was a deed which contained this order; and that he might as well have looked into his friend Geoffrey of Monmouth, or Slawkenbergius upon No&s;es, for it, as into Canynge's will. Upon this, with much &s;hew of accuracy and learning, he tran&s;cribes a great part of the contents of this &s;ame will into a note; for what rea&s;on, but to prove that he had read it, I cannot conceive. And here, becau&s;e Canynge was dean of We&s;tbury college, he gives us a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the repairs of that college; he might as well, becau&s;e Canynge was a merchant, have taken oc|ca&s;ion to digre&s;s into a &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation upon trade. For, in fact, all this learn|ing, and all this long quotation, would
<PB N="33" REF="32">have been ju&s;t as much to the purpo&s;e, and proved as much in one ca&s;e as it does in the other. Had our Profe&s;&s;or be|&s;towed but half as much care and accu|racy upon the main points in di&s;pute, he might, perhaps, have gone &s;ome way to|wards &s;ettling this whole affair.</P>
<P>As to the memoirs of Rowlie, I have little to &s;ay; much, po&s;&s;ibly, may be true, and much interpolated; for which rea|&s;on, and becau&s;e, as I have &s;aid before, I never could get any account of this frag|ment at all &s;atisfactory, v. g. by whom it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, through who&s;e hands it fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, what authority it ultimately re&s;ts upon, I &s;hall not attempt to give any opinion at all upon the matter. However, the Profe&s;&s;or's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words which he objects to, are <HI>drawings,</HI> in its pre&s;ent uncombined &s;en&s;e. <HI>Manu&s;cripts; Abbot of Coventrie,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Prior, Repayring lea&s;e.</HI></NOTE> objections, being entirely again&s;t words, do not &s;eem to affect its authenticity in any article at all material.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the Pro|fe&s;&s;or's &s;ection; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, it has
<PB N="34" REF="33">been a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;k, to which the want of method did not a little con|tribute; and what is wor&s;e, it &s;eems to be of very little concern with him, whe|ther he is right or wrong, whether he informs or mi&s;leads his reader. Cer|tainly, however, he does not fulfill the promi&s;e he made at the beginning of his &s;ection, viz. <HI>of laying before his reader every internal and external argument, to enable him to determine upon the merits of this controver&s;y.</HI> Indeed, he tacitly confe&s;&s;es as much him&s;elf, by annexing to it, as he has done, &s;ome <HI>additions and emendations.</HI> From the&s;e I had, I own, &s;ome hopes of being more fully &s;atisfied; thinking, that by this means he had a fair opportunity of retracting &s;ome of tho&s;e ra&s;h a&s;&s;ertions which he deals in &s;o very largely; and correcting, at lea&s;t &s;ome of the inac|curacies we &s;o frequently meet with throughout the &s;ection. But, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I was mi&s;erably di&s;appointed; the only <HI>addition</HI> I could perceive, being that he has added fal&s;e fact to fal&s;e argu|ment; the only <HI>emendation,</HI> that he has
<PB N="35" REF="34">corrected him&s;elf when he happened, by &s;ome mi&s;take or other, rather unu&s;ual with him, to be in the right.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method I pre&s;cribed to my|&s;elf in examining the foregoing part of the Profe&s;&s;or's work, I &s;hall follow in this al&s;o, and give the reader a &s;ummary account of its contents, before I examine it particularly. The&s;e (as far as the na|ture of the thing will admit of its being reduced to any &s;ettled form) &s;eem, to the be&s;t of my apprehen&s;ion, to be as follow: Some additional cavils upon words; &s;ome apology for inaccuracies; and &s;ome <HI>new proofs,</HI> for &s;o he chu&s;es to call them, again&s;t the authenticity of the Poems in general, and one of them in particular, the Battle of Ha&s;tings. His arguments again&s;t the Poems in general, are, from their being &s;o excellent in them&s;elves, and &s;o very unlike tho&s;e of cotemporary writers: again&s;t the Battle of Ha&s;tings in particular, from the time at which Tur|got (the &s;uppo&s;ed original author) died, and from the want of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing circum&s;tances in the Poem it&s;elf. After
<PB N="36" REF="35">this the Profe&s;&s;or enlarges afre&s;h upon the peculiar merit of Chatterton, and the motives which might have tempted him to &s;uch a forgery.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to be forced to ob&s;erve, that the Profe&s;&s;or &s;eems to &s;et off rather ominou&s;ly, by correcting him&s;elf in one of the few truths and be&s;t grounded a&s;|&s;ertions to be met with in his whole &s;ec|tion; viz. that <HI>Turgot died in</HI> 1115 (forty-nine years after the battle of Ha&s;tings) not in 1015 (fifty-one years before it) as he now affirms in this correction, with an intention to build an argument upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This correction, being no more than one line, may e&s;cape many readers; it is printed with a re|ference to the page, but none to the &s;ubject, thus:

In the following note he informs us, that <HI>he has received notices from St. Ewin's church at Bri&s;tol, anciently called the min&s;ter; which import, that the pave|ment was wa&s;hed again&s;t the coming of King Edward; which does not at all prove or imply, that the King &s;at at the great min|&s;ter
<PB N="37" REF="36">window to &s;ee the gallant Lanca&s;trian pa&s;s to the &s;caffold.</HI> That I may not &s;eem to differ from him for cavilling &s;ake, I here intirely agree with him: I believe the wa&s;hing of the pavement was never urged as a proof that the King &s;at at the window, but only as a corroborating cir|cum&s;tance of Edward's being at Bri&s;tol about that time. The circum&s;tance of his &s;itting at the window, the Profe&s;&s;or objects to as improbable; why, I do not &s;ee, as the general character of Edward rather encourages &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, than contradicts it. His next objection is, that St. Ewin's church was formerly called the min&s;ter; but that he <HI>&s;u&s;pects,</HI> that what the poet intended here by the word min&s;ter, mu&s;t have been the pre|&s;ent cathedral; and that he <HI>does not think</HI> that <HI>the</HI> min&s;ter of our Lady <HI>was a common appellation for Worce&s;ter cathedral at that time.</HI> Till the Profe&s;&s;or thinks fit to pro|duce &s;ome ground for his &s;u&s;picion and be|lief, they cannot be con&s;idered as arguments of any great weight; and if he really had made out both, I do not &s;ee what advan|tage
<PB N="38" REF="37">it would have been to him in regard to the point in hand.</P>
<P>In his next note, he confe&s;&s;es very frankly, that he may have been guilty of &s;ome inaccuracies in his &s;ection; and makes the reader an apology for them. Here again I think the Profe&s;&s;or perfectly in the right; and as he has confe&s;&s;ed thus much in general, I do not think it would be ami&s;s, if he was to &s;pecify and retract all his errors, as well in the <HI>additions</HI> and, <HI>emendations,</HI> as in the &s;ection it&s;elf. It would not be much longer than his &s;ec|tion, which does not &s;eem to have co&s;t him overmuch trouble. But to return to his apology. He had not, it &s;eems, when he wrote this eighth &s;ection, <HI>&s;een all the Poems;</HI> what he had &s;een were only <HI>extracts,</HI> and tho&s;e extracts <HI>not al|ways exact.</HI> From the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions of his own, have we not &s;ome right to a&s;k the Profe&s;&s;or the following que&s;tions? Why he cho&s;e to decide upon a &s;ubject which he had not thoroughly informed him&s;elf of? Why he took upon him to promi&s;e his readers every <HI>internal and ex|ternal
<PB N="39" REF="38">argument,</HI> relating to the contro|ver&s;y, at a time when, by his own con|fe&s;&s;ion, he had not read half the Poems? Why, in all the time between the writ|ing of his &s;ection, and the publication of his book, he never took the trouble to go to Bri&s;tol, and examine the matter on the &s;pot? Why, &s;ince he has read the Poems, he has not corrected tho&s;e errors, which he owns he has committed?&mdash; The&s;e interrogations are &s;urely natural, and the Profe&s;&s;or probably might find &s;ome difficulty in an&s;wering them. For however great any man's critical abilities and antiquarian knowledge may be, &s;ome little acquaintance with the &s;ubject he treats of, mu&s;t at lea&s;t make his deci&s;ion more &s;atisfactory. However, even now, &s;ince he has &s;een all the Poems, his opi|nion, we find, is &s;till the &s;ame; they have even afforded him &s;ome <HI>new proofs.</HI> The fir&s;t of which &s;eems to be nothing more than that Rowlie is not like any of our ancient <HI>bards.</HI> He has told us be|fore, that the Poems are like modern ones, which is pretty much the &s;ame
<PB N="40" REF="39">thing. But neither the excellence of any compo&s;ition, any more than the <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> of it, nor indeed the di&s;&s;imilitude be|tween that and other cotemporary writ|ings, are by any means an ab&s;olute proof that it mu&s;t be a forgery. His next ar|gument is, that the Poems in que&s;tion <HI>appear to have been compo&s;ed after ideas of di&s;crimination took place.</HI> What &s;ort of Poems they mu&s;t be, which were com|po&s;ed before &s;uch a period, for my part, I own I am &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to con|ceive; as &s;uch ideas &s;eem always to be of &s;ome little u&s;e, if not ab&s;olutely and in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in making any poems, whether ancient or modern, in|telligible.</P>
<P>But <HI>in the Battle of Ha&s;tings there are &s;ome great anachroni&s;ms, and practices men|tioned which did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t till afterwards.</HI> The Profe&s;&s;or has not, however, pointed out any particular ones; and if there were any, they have e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation, and I am apt to believe, will do the &s;ame to mo&s;t readers. His next proof, and which perhaps, if true, would be quite
<PB N="41" REF="40">deci&s;ive, is as follows: <HI>Turgot, from who&s;e Saxon</HI> chronicle (no longer a Latin one) <HI>this Poem is &s;aid to be tran&s;lated, died in</HI> 1015, and therefore could not have written any account of the Battle of Ha&s;tings, which did not happen till 1066, viz. fifty-one years after his death. This I own appeared, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to have great weight, as I did not conceive it po&s;&s;ible that any one could be &s;o very ignorant of the author whom he had ac|tually tran&s;lated; or that one of the Pro|fe&s;&s;or's character &s;hould have mi&s;repre|&s;ented, in &s;o very extraordinary a manner, &s;o material a date as this, e&s;pecially as he had founded one of his principal ar|guments upon it. Upon looking into Bale, Nichol&s;on, and &s;ome others, it ap|pears, that this latter (viz. that the Pro|fe&s;&s;or has mi&s;repre&s;ented the ca&s;e) is the fact, and that Turgot did not die till 1115, as the Profe&s;&s;or had rightly ob|&s;erved at fir&s;t in his note upon J. Lyd|gate's An&s;wer, &amp;c. but finding it would &s;tand in the way of this argument, cor|rected it afterwards in his <HI>additions and
<PB N="42" REF="41">emendations;</HI> and has here produced his own error, or whatever el&s;e the reader &s;hall think proper to call it, as a proof that the Poem is a forgery. If this be one of tho&s;e anachroni&s;ms the Profe&s;&s;or has hinted at before, and they are all no better founded than this, he has certainly &s;hewn great judgment in keeping them to him&s;elf. But <HI>allowing that Turgot might have lived in the time of the Con|queror, yet it is very extraordinary that a cotemporary writer &s;hould mention nothing but what we knew before, and that the in|cidents are &s;uch as are common in all battles.</HI> What peculiarities would have &s;atisfied the Profe&s;&s;or, is not ea&s;y to conceive. There are &s;urely di&s;tingui&s;hing circum|&s;tances enough in this Poem, to give it every mark of being genuine, that could reafonably have been expected by any one. It agrees with other hi&s;tories in &s;uch a manner, as to prove its authenticity that way; and where it di&s;agrees, it is in &s;uch a manner as rather to prove it an ori|ginal that way. Some incidents mu&s;t be the &s;ame in all battles: in this however,
<PB N="43" REF="42">there feem to be many very di&s;tingui&s;h|ing ones. But it is the hard fate of Rowlie to have his Poems found fault with every way. If a circum&s;tance not mentioned in other writers, occurs, &s;uch as Stonehenge's being a Druidical temple, that is urged again&s;t him as a proof of forgery; if he agrees with other writ|ers, his Poem is condemned upon that account: as if, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, tho&s;e who lived &s;ome centuries nearer the times of the Druids, might not have been better informed than tho&s;e who lived &s;o many centuries after; in the latter, as if it was impo&s;&s;ible that two writers &s;hould agree in the &s;ame &s;tory.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn this piece to be &s;purious, he proceeds from this very <HI>piece to demon&s;trate the &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s of the re&s;t. Chatterton allowed the fir&s;t part to be a forgery of his own: the &s;econd part, from what has been &s;aid, cannot be genuine; and he who could write the &s;econd part, could write every line in the whole collection.</HI> This train of con&s;equences is, I own, more than I can comprehend: the con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="44" REF="43">he means to draw from it, is, pro|bably, that Chatterton <HI>did write every line in the whole collection.</HI> How this is made out, the reader may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee; I do not, and can therefore do no more than object to the parts &s;eparately. And fir&s;t of Chatterton's declaration; how far we can rely upon this is much to be doubted. The Profe&s;&s;or, however, as it &s;erves his turn, has cho&s;en to give credit to him. But &s;ure any one el&s;e has at lea&s;t as much right to believe him, when he a&s;&s;irmed the &s;econd part to be Row|lie's, as the Profe&s;&s;or has, when he af|firmed the fir&s;t part to be his own. Nor is the &s;econd part proved a forgery, from any thing that has been &s;aid by the Pro|fe&s;&s;or; except Chatterton's declaring the fir&s;t was his own, proves the &s;econd was &s;o too. If this be what the Profe&s;&s;or would have us believe, his conclu&s;ion can hardly be allowed. If he would in&s;inu|ate, that his own arguments have proved it a forgery, that, I think, is &s;till le&s;s likely to be admitted of.</P>
<P>After this, the Profe&s;&s;or, in another:
<PB N="45" REF="44">mo&s;t gracious mood of conce&s;&s;ion&mdash;whe|ther from &s;ome mi&s;givings of the force of his arguments, or from confidence in the &s;trength of them, or for any other rea&s;on known only to him&s;elf, I &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to &s;ay&mdash;with his u&s;ual candour, grants that it is po&s;&s;ible Chatterton may not be the author; but if it was &s;o, he &s;ays, <HI>it is no proof that the Poems are not forged. But this is a new and another que&s;tion.</HI> I cannot help ob&s;erving, how|ever, how extremely improbable it is, that any man who could write &s;uch Poems as the&s;e, &s;hould be again&s;t owning them, when neither life, nor &s;afety, nor intere&s;t of any kind, was in the ca&s;e; but that he &s;hould u&s;her his impo&s;ture into the world by means of a boy, who had ju&s;t left a charity-&s;chool, and who&s;e veracity, from his known character, every one would be inclined to &s;u&s;pect, is every thing but impo&s;&s;ible. It is al&s;o equally increadible, that a boy of little more than fifteen, who&s;e avowed works have not &s;uch marks of genius in them as the Profe&s;&s;or would make us believe&mdash;who had never learnt
<PB N="46" REF="45">any thing except reading, writing, and ac|counts&mdash;who&s;e time, from the day he left &s;chool, was mo&s;tly taken up in writing for an attorney&mdash;who&s;e lei&s;ure hours were wa&s;ted in debauchery&mdash;who died, want|ing upwards of three months of eigh|teen&mdash;&s;hould have either time or abilities to contrive and execute &s;uch a forgery. I hope tho&s;e few pieces in the Magazines, which the Profe&s;&s;or has been &s;o kind as to point out, and who&s;e peculiar merit might otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped the gene|rality of readers, are not in&s;tances of that a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>prematurity of abilities, com|prehen&s;ion of mind, and vigour of under|&s;tanding, which predominated over his &s;itu|ations in life, and opportunities of in&s;truc|tion;</HI> many of them are very bald, and, in my opinion, at mo&s;t, very un&s;ucce&s;s|ful imitations of O&s;&s;ian, without any great marks of genius or &s;pirit. That he wi&s;hed to put off &s;ome of his own poems for Rowlie's is certain; I my&s;elf have &s;een &s;ome written with &s;uch a de&s;ign, but &s;o unlike Rowlie, that, to unbia&s;&s;ed readers, it mu&s;t appear impo&s;&s;ible, that
<PB N="47" REF="46">the &s;ame per&s;on &s;hould have written tho&s;e and the collection printed in Rowlie's name. They are the wor&s;t even of Chat|terton's own compo&s;itions; and &s;hew, that however antiquarian imagery had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his imagination, it communicated no &s;hare of excellence to his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This, to the be&s;t of my judgment, is the &s;um of every thing at all material, that the Profe&s;&s;or has advanced by way of argument. In any of which, I &s;hould be &s;orry to have omitted or mi&s;repre|&s;ented the minute&s;t circum&s;tance. The latter I have endeavoured to guard again&s;t on all occa&s;ions, as &s;trictly as I po&s;&s;ibly could, by u&s;ing, as much as po&s;&s;ible, his own words. And if I do not flatter my|&s;elf too much, I have, I hope, made it appear to every unprejudiced reader, that his narrative is by no means exact, nor his quotations faithful: that his ex|ternal arguments are far from being &s;a|tisfactory; his internal neither fair nor conclu&s;ive: that Chatterton was not equal to the compo&s;ition of &s;uch Poems, either by his natural or his acquired
<PB N="48" REF="47">abilities; in a word, that the Profe&s;&s;or's &s;y&s;tem throughout, is not &s;upported by a &s;ingle argument that holds good, or a &s;ingle fact that may not be que&s;tioned.</P>
