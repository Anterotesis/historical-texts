<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NATURAL HISTORY, con&s;idered in its utmo&s;t extent, comprehends
two ob|jects. Fir&s;t, that of di&s;covering, a&s;cer|taining, and naming all
the various pro|ductions of nature. Secondly, that of de&s;cribing the
properties, manners, and relations, which they bear to us, and to each other.
The fir&s;t, which is the mo&s;t difficult part of this &s;cience, is
&s;y&s;|tematical, dry, mechanical, and incom|plete. The &s;econd is more
amu&s;ing, exhibits new pictures to the imagination, and improves our reli&s;h
for exi&s;tence, by widening the pro&s;pect of nature around us.</P>
<P>Both, however, are nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who would under&s;tand
this plea&s;ing <PB N="ii" REF="3"> &s;cience, in its utmo&s;t extent. The
fir&s;t care of every enquirer, no doubt &s;hould be, to &s;ee to vi&s;it and
examine every object, before he pretends to in&s;pect its habitudes or its
hi&s;tory. From &s;eeing and ob&s;erving the thing it&s;elf, he is mo&s;t
naturally led to &s;pe|culate upon its u&s;es, its delights, or its
inconveniences.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions, however, are found in this part of
his pur&s;uit, that fru&s;trate his diligence and retard his cu|rio&s;ity. The
objects in nature are &s;o many, and even tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind are
exhibited in &s;uch a variety of forms, that the enquirer finds him&s;elf
lo&s;t, in the exuberance before him, and, like a man who attempts to count the
&s;tars una&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, his powers are all di&s;tracted in the barren
&s;uperfluity.</P>
<P>To remedy this embarra&s;ment, arti|ficial &s;y&s;tems have been
devi&s;ed, which grouping into ma&s;&s;es tho&s;e parts of nature more nearly
re&s;embling each other, refer the enquirer for the name of the &s;ingle 
<PB N="iii" REF="4"> object he de&s;ires to know to &s;ome one of tho&s;e
general di&s;tributions, where it is to be found by further examination.</P>
<P>If, for in&s;tance, a man &s;hould, in his walks, meet with an
animal, the name, and con&s;equently the hi&s;tory of which, he de&s;ires to
know, he is taught by &s;y&s;te|matic writers of natural hi&s;tory, to ex|amine
its mo&s;t obvious qualities, whether a quadrupede, a bird, a fi&s;h, or an
in&s;ect. Having determined it, for ex|planation &s;ake, to be an in&s;ect, he
exa|mines whether it has wings; if he finds it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e, he
is taught to ex|amine whether it has two or four; if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of four,
he is taught to ob&s;erve, whether the two upper wings are of a &s;helly
hardne&s;s, and &s;erve as ca&s;es to tho&s;e under them; if he finds the wings
compo&s;ed in this manner, he is then taught to pronounce, that this in&s;ect
is one of the beetle kind: of the beetle kind, there are three different
cla&s;&s;es, di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by their feelers; he examines
the in&s;ect before <PB N="iv" REF="5"> him, and finds that the feelers are
clavated or knobbed at the ends; of beetles, with feelers thus formed, there
are ten kinds; and among tho&s;e, he is taught to look for the preci&s;e name
of that which is before him. If, for in|&s;tance, the knob be divided at the
ends, and the belly be &s;treaked with white, it is no other than the Dor or
the May|bug; an animal, the noxious qualities of which give it a very
di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in the hi&s;tory of the in&s;ect creation. In this
manner a &s;y&s;tem of natural hi&s;tory may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be compared
to a dictionary of words. Both are &s;olely intended to explain the names of
things; but with this difference, that in the dic|tionary of words we are led
from the name of the thing to its definition; whereas in the &s;y&s;tem of
natural hi&s;tory, we are led from the definition to find out the name.</P>
<P>Such are the efforts of writers, who have compo&s;ed their works
with great labour and ingenuity, to direct the learner in his <PB N="v" REF="6"> progre&s;s through nature, and to inform him of the name of every
animal, plant, or fo&s;&s;il &s;ub&s;tance, that he happens to meet with; but
it would be only deceiving the reader, to conceal the truth, which is, that
books alone can never teach him this art in perfection; and the &s;olitary
&s;tudent can never &s;ucceed. Without a ma&s;ter, and a previous knowledge of
many of the ob|jects in nature, his book will only &s;erve to confound and
di&s;gu&s;t him. Few of the individual plants or animals, that he may happen to
meet with, are in that preci&s;e &s;tate of health, or that exact period of
vegetation, from whence their de&s;crip|tions were taken. Perhaps he meets the
plant only with leaves, but the &s;y&s;tematic writer has de&s;cribed it in
flower. Per|haps he meets the bird before it has moulted its fir&s;t feathers,
while the &s;y&s;te|matic de&s;cription was made in its &s;tate of full
perfection. He thus ranges with|out an in&s;tructor, confu&s;ed and with
&s;ickening curio&s;ity from &s;ubject to &s;ub|ject, till at la&s;t he gives
up the pur&s;uit, <PB N="vi" REF="7"> in the multiplicity of his
di&s;appoint|ments.</P>
<P>Some practice therefore, much in&s;truc|tion and diligent reading
are requi&s;ite to make a ready and expert naturali&s;t, who &s;hall be able,
even by the help of a &s;y&s;tem, to find out the name of every object he meets
with. But when this tedious, though requi&s;ite part of &s;tudy is attained,
nothing but delight and variety attend the re&s;t of his journey. Wherever he
travels, like a man in a country where he has many friends, he meets with
nothing but acquaintances and al|lurements in all the &s;tages of his way. The
meer uninformed &s;pectator pa&s;&s;es on in gloomy &s;olitude; but the
naturali&s;t, in every plant, in every in&s;ect, and every pebble, finds
&s;omething to entertain his curio&s;ity, and excite his &s;peculation.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that a &s;y&s;tem may be con&s;idered as a
dictionary in the &s;tudy of nature. The ancients, however, who have all
written mo&s;t delightfully on this &s;ubject, &s;eem entirely to have rejected
<PB N="vii" REF="8"> tho&s;e humble and mechanical helps to &s;cience. They
contented them&s;elves with &s;eizing upon the great outlines of hi&s;tory, and
pa&s;&s;ing over what was common, as not worth the detail; they only dwelt upon
what was new, great, and &s;ur|pri&s;ing, and &s;ometimes even warmed the
imagination at the expence of truth. Such of the moderns as revived this
&s;cience in Europe undertook the ta&s;k more methodically, though not in a
man|ner &s;o plea&s;ing. Aldrovandus, Ge&s;ner, and John&s;on, &s;eemed
de&s;irous of uniting the entertaining and rich de&s;criptions of the ancients
with the dry and &s;y&s;|tematic arrangement, of which they were the fir&s;t
projectors. This attempt, however, was extremely imperfect, as the great
variety of nature was, as yet, but very inadequately known. Neverthele&s;s, by
attempting to carry on both objects at once; fir&s;t, of directing us to the
name, of the thing; and then, giving the detail of its hi&s;tory, they drew out
their works into a tedious and unrea&s;onable length; <PB N="viii" REF="9"> and
thus mixing incompatible aims they have left their labours, rather to be
oc|ca&s;ionally con&s;ulted than read with de|light by po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The later moderns, with that good &s;en&s;e which they have
carried into every other part of &s;cience, have taken a diffe|rent method in
cultivating natural hi&s;tory. They have been content to give, not only the
brevity, but al&s;o the dry and di&s;gu&s;ting air of a dictionary to their
&s;y&s;tems. Ray, Klin, Bri&s;&s;on, and Linnaeus, have had only one aim, that
of pointing out the object in nature, of di&s;covering its name, and where it
was to be found in tho&s;e au|thors that treated of it in a more prolix and
&s;atisfactory manner. Thus na|tural hi&s;tory at pre&s;ent is carried on, in
two di&s;tinct and &s;eparate channels, the one &s;erving to lead us to the
thing, the other conveying the hi&s;tory of the thing, as &s;uppo&s;ing it
already known.</P>
<P>The following Natural Hi&s;tory is writ|ten, with only &s;uch an
attention to &s;y&s;|tem as &s;erves to remove the reader's
em|barra&s;&s;ments, <PB N="ix" REF="10"> and allure him to proceed. It can
make no preten&s;ions in directing him to the name of every object he meets
with; that belongs to works of a very different kind, and written with very
different aims. It will fully an&s;wer my de&s;ign, if the reader, being
already po&s;&s;e&s;t of the name of any animal, &s;hall find here a &s;hort,
though &s;atisfactory hi&s;|tory of its habitudes, its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, its
manners, its friend&s;hips and ho&s;tilities. My aim has been to carry on
ju&s;t as much method, as was &s;ufficient to &s;horten my de&s;criptions by
generalizing them, and never to follow order where the art of writing, which is
but another name for good &s;en&s;e, informed me that it would only contribute
to the reader's embarra&s;&s;|ment.</P>
<P>Still, however, the reader will perceive, that I have formed a
kind of &s;y&s;tem in the hi&s;tory of every part of animated na|ture,
directing my&s;elf by the great ob|vious di&s;tinctions that &s;he her&s;elf
&s;eems to have made, which, though too few to <PB N="x" REF="11"> point
exactly to the name, are yet &s;uffi|cient to illuminate the &s;ubject, and
re|move the reader's perplexity. Mr. Buf|fon, indeed, who has brought greater
talents to this part of learning than any other man, has almo&s;t entirely
reject|ed method in cla&s;&s;ing quadrupedes. This, with great deference to
&s;uch a character, appears to me running into the oppo&s;ite extreme; and, as
&s;ome mo|derns have of late &s;pent much time, great pains, and &s;ome
learning, all to very little purpo&s;e, in &s;y&s;tematic ar|rangement, he
&s;eems &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted by their trifling, but o&s;tentatious efforts,
that he de&s;cribes his animals, almo&s;t in the order they happen to come
before him. This want of method &s;eems to be a fault; but he can lo&s;e little
by a cri|tici&s;m which every dull man can make, or by an error in arrangement,
from which the dulle&s;t are the mo&s;t u&s;ually free.</P>
<P>In other re&s;pects, as far as this able philo&s;opher has gone, I
have taken <PB N="xi" REF="12"> him for my guide. The warmth of his &s;tyle,
and the brilliancy of his imagina|tion, are inimitable. Leaving him there|fore
without a rival in the&s;e, and only availing my&s;elf of his information, I
have been content to de&s;cribe things in my own way; and though many of the
materials are taken from him, yet I have added, retrenched, and altered, as I
thought proper. It was my intention at one time, whenever I differed from him,
to have mentioned it at the bottom of the page; but this occured &s;o often,
that I &s;oon found it would look like envy, and might perhaps, convict me of
tho&s;e very errors which I was wanting to lay upon him. I have therefore, as
being every way his debtor, concealed my di&s;&s;ent, where my opinion was
different; but wherever I borrow from him, I take care at the bottom of the
page to expre&s;s my obligations. But though my obliga|tions to this writer are
many, they extend but to the &s;malle&s;t part of the work, as he has hitherto
compleated only the hi&s;|tory <PB N="xii" REF="13"> of quadrupedes. I was
therefore left to my own reading alone, to make out the hi&s;tory of birds,
fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, of which the arrangement was &s;o difficult, and the
nece&s;&s;ary information &s;o widely diffu&s;ed and &s;o ob&s;curely related
when found, that it proved by much the mo&s;t laborious part of the
undertaking. Thus having made u&s;e of Mr. Buf|fon's lights in the fir&s;t part
of the work, I may, with &s;ome &s;hare of confidence, recommend it to the
public. But what &s;hall I &s;ay to that part, where I have been entirely left
without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance? As I would affect neither mode&s;ty nor
confi|dence, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that my reading upon this part
of the &s;ubject has been very exten&s;ive; and that I have taxed my &s;canty
circum&s;tances in procuring books which are on this &s;ubject, of all others,
the mo&s;t expen&s;ive. In con&s;e|quence of this indu&s;try, I here offer a
work to the public, of a kind, which has never been attempted in ours, or any
other modern language, that I know <PB N="xiii" REF="14"> of. The ancients,
indeed, and Pliny in particular, have anticipated me, in the pre&s;ent manner
of treating natural hi&s;tory. Like tho&s;e hi&s;torians who de&s;cribe the
e|vents of a campaign, they have not conde|&s;cended to give the private
particulars of every individual that formed the army; they were content with
characterizing the ge|nerals, and de&s;cribing their operations, while they
left it to meaner hands to carry the mu&s;ter-roll. I have followed their
manner, rejecting the numerous fables which they adopted, and adding the
improvements of the moderns, which are &s;o numerous, that they actually make
up the bulk of natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The delight which I found in reading Pliny, fir&s;t in&s;pired me
with the idea of a work of this nature. Having a ta&s;te rather cla&s;&s;ical
than &s;cientific, and hav|ing but little employed my&s;elf in turn|ing over
the dry labours of modern &s;y&s;tem-makers, my earlie&s;t intention was to
tran&s;late this agreeable writer, and by the help of a commentary to make 
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"> my work as amu&s;ing as I could. Let us dignify natural
hi&s;tory never &s;o much with the grave appellation of a u&s;eful &s;cience,
yet &s;till we mu&s;t confe&s;s that it is the occupation of the idle and the
&s;peculative, more than of the bu&s;y and the ambitious part of mankind. My
inten|tion therefore was to treat what I then conceived to be an idle
&s;ubject, in an idle manner; and not to hedge round plain and &s;imple
narratives with hard words, accu|mulated di&s;tinctions, o&s;tentatious
learning, and di&s;qui&s;itions that produced no convic|tion. Upon the
appearance however of Mr. Buffon's work, I dropped my former plan, and adopted
the pre&s;ent, being con|vinced by his manner, that the be&s;t imita|tion of
the ancients was to write from our own feelings, and to imitate nature.</P>
<P>It will be my chief pride therefore, if this work may be found an
innocent amu&s;ement for tho&s;e who have nothing el&s;e to employ them, or who
require a relaxation from labour. Profe&s;&s;ed natu|rali&s;ts will, no doubt,
find it &s;uperficial; <PB N="xv" REF="16"> and yet I &s;hould hope that even
the&s;e will di&s;cover hints, and remarks, gleaned from various reading, not
wholly trite or elementary. I would wi&s;h for their approbation. But my chief
ambition is to drag up the ob&s;cure and gloomy learning of the cell to open
in&s;pection; to &s;trip it from its garb of au&s;terity, and to &s;hew the
beauties of that form, which only the indu&s;trious and the inqui&s;itive have
been hitherto permitted to approach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. A Sketch of the Univer&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE world may be con&s;idered as one va&s;t man&s;ion, where man has
been admitted to enjoy, to admire, and to be grateful. The fir&s;t de&s;ires of
&s;avage nature are merely to gratify the importunities of &s;en&s;ual
appetite, and to neglect the contemplation of things, barely &s;atisfied with
their enjoyment: the beauties of nature, and all the wonders of creation, have
but little charms for a being taken up in obviat|ing the wants of the day, and
anxious for pre|carious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="20">Our philo&s;ophers, therefore, who have
te&s;ti|fied &s;uch &s;urprize at the want of curio&s;ity in the ignorant,
&s;eem not to con&s;ider that they are u&s;ually employed in making
provi&s;ions of a more important nature; in providing rather for the
nece&s;&s;ities than the amu&s;ements of life. It is not till our more
pre&s;&s;ing wants are &s;uffi|ciently &s;upplied, that we can attend to the
calls of curio&s;ity; &s;o that in every age &s;cientific refinement has been
the late&s;t effort of human indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But human curio&s;ity, though, at fir&s;t, &s;lowly excited, being
at la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lei&s;ure for indulging its propen&s;ity,
becomes one of the greate&s;t amu&s;ements of life, and gives higher
&s;atisfactions than what even the &s;en&s;es can afford. A man of this
di&s;po&s;ition turns all nature into a magnificent theatre, replete with
objects of wonder and &s;urprize, and fitted up chiefly for his happine&s;s and
entertainment: he indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly examines all things, from the minute&s;t
in&s;ect to the mo&s;t fini&s;hed animal; and, when his limited organs can no
longer make the di&s;|qui&s;ition, he &s;ends out his imagination upon new
enquiries.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, can be more augu&s;t and &s;triking than the
idea which his rea&s;on, aided by his imagination, furni&s;hes of the
univer&s;e <PB N="3" REF="21"> around him. A&s;tronomers tell us, that this
earth which we inhabit forms but a very minute part in that great
a&s;&s;emblage of bodies of which the world is compo&s;ed. It is a million of
times le&s;s than the &s;un, by which it is enlightened. The planets al&s;o,
which, like it, are &s;ubordinate to the &s;un's influence, exceed the earth
one thou&s;and times in magnitude. The&s;e, which were at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed
to wander in the heavens without any fixed path, and that took their name from
their apparent deviations, have long been found to perform their circuits with
great exactne&s;s and &s;trict regularity. They have been di&s;covered as
forming with our earth a &s;y&s;tem of bodies circulating round the &s;un, all
obedient to one law, and impelled by one common influence.</P>
<P>Modern philo&s;ophy has taught us to be|lieve, that, when the great
Author of nature began the work of creation, he cho&s;e to ope|rate by &s;econd
cau&s;es; and, that, &s;u&s;pending the con&s;tant exertion of his power, he
endued matter with a quality by which the univer&s;al oeconomy of nature might
be continued with|out his immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This quality is called
<HI>attraction</HI>; a &s;ort of approximating influ|ence, which all bodies,
whether terre&s;trial or cele&s;tial, are found to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and which in
all <PB N="4" REF="22"> encrea&s;es as the quantity of matter in each
en|crea&s;es. The &s;un, by far the greate&s;t body in our &s;y&s;tem, is, of
con&s;equence, po&s;&s;e&s;t of much the greate&s;t &s;hare of this attracting
power; and all the planets, of which our earth is one, are, of cour&s;e,
entirely &s;ubject to its &s;uperior influence. Were this power, therefore,
left uncontrolled by any other, the &s;un mu&s;t quickly have attracted all the
bodies of our cele&s;tial &s;y&s;tem to it&s;elf; but it is equably
counteracted by another power of equal efficacy; namely, a progre&s;&s;ive
force which each planet received when it was impelled forward, by the divine
architect, upon its fir&s;t formation. The heavenly bodies of our &s;y&s;tem
being thus acted upon by two oppo&s;ing powers; namely, by that of
<HI>attraction,</HI> which draws them towards the &s;un; and that of
<HI>impul&s;ion,</HI> which drives them &s;trait forward into the great void of
&s;pace; they pur&s;ue a track between the&s;e contrary direc|tions; and each,
like a &s;tone whirled about in a &s;ling, obeying two oppo&s;ite forces,
circulates round its great centre of heat and motion.</P>
<P>In this manner, therefore, is the harmony of our planetary
&s;y&s;tem pre&s;erved. The &s;un, in the mid&s;t, gives heat, and light, and
circular motion to the planets which &s;urround it: Mercury, Venus, the Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, <PB N="5" REF="23"> and Saturn, perform their con&s;tant
circuits at different di&s;tances, each taking up a time to compleat its
revolutions proportioned to the greatne&s;s of the circle which it is to
de|&s;cribe. The le&s;&s;er planets al&s;o, which are attend|ants upon &s;ome
of the greater, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws; they circulate with the
&s;ame exactne&s;s; and are, in the &s;ame manner, influ|enced by their
re&s;pective centres of motion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e bodies which make a part of our peculiar
&s;y&s;tem, and which may be &s;aid to re&s;ide within its great circumference;
there are others, that frequently come among us, from the mo&s;t di&s;tant
tracts of &s;pace, and that &s;eem like dangerous intruders upon the beau|tiful
&s;implicity of nature. The&s;e are comets, who&s;e appearance was once &s;o
terrible to man|kind, and the theory of which is &s;o little under&s;tood at
pre&s;ent: all we know, is, that their number is much greater than that of the
planets; and that, like the&s;e, they roll in orbits, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
obedient to Solar influence. A&s;tronomers have endeavoured to calculate the
returning periods of many of them; but expe|rience has not, as yet, confirmed
the veracity of their inve&s;tigations: indeed, who can tell when tho&s;e
wanderers have made their excur&s;ions into other worlds and di&s;tant
&s;y&s;tems, what <PB N="6" REF="24"> ob&s;tacles may be found to oppo&s;e
their progre&s;s, to accelerate their motions, or retard their re|turn?</P>
<P>But what we have hitherto attempted to &s;ketch, is but a &s;mall
part of that great fabric in which the Deity has thought proper to manife&s;t
his wi&s;dom and omnipotence. There are multitudes of other bodies di&s;per&s;t
over the face of the heavens that lie too remote for ex|amination: the&s;e have
no motion, &s;uch as the planets are found to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and are,
therefore, called fixed &s;tars; and from their extreme brilliancy and their
immen&s;e di&s;tance, philo&s;o|phers have been induced to &s;uppo&s;e them to
be &s;uns re&s;embling that which enlivens our &s;y&s;tem: as the imagination
al&s;o, once exited, is &s;eldom content to &s;top, it has furni&s;hed each
with an attendant &s;y&s;tem of planets belonging to it&s;elf, and has even
induced &s;ome to deplore the fate of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, who&s;e imagined
&s;uns, which &s;ometimes happens, have become no longer vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>But conjectures of this kind, which no rea&s;oning can a&s;certain,
nor experiment reach, are rather amu&s;ing than u&s;eful. Though we &s;ee the
greatne&s;s and wi&s;dom of the Deity in all the &s;eeming worlds that
&s;urround us, it is our chief concern to trace him in that which 
<PB N="7" REF="25"> we inhabit. The examination of the earth, the wonders of
its contrivance, the hi&s;tory of its advantages, or of the &s;eeming defects
in its for|mation, are the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>natural
hi&s;torian.</HI> A de&s;cription of this earth, its <HI>animals,
vegetables,</HI> and <HI>minerals,</HI> is the mo&s;t delightful entertainment
the mind can be fur|ni&s;hed with, as it is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and
u&s;eful. I would beg leave, therefore, to con|clude the&s;e common-place
&s;peculations, with an ob&s;ervation, which, I hope, is not entirely &s;o.</P>
<P>An u&s;e, hitherto not much in&s;i&s;ted upon, that may re&s;ult
from the contemplation of cele&s;tial magnificence, is, that it will teach us
to make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below. Whenever we
can examine the works of the Deity at a proper point of di&s;tance, &s;o as to
take in the whole of his de&s;ign, we &s;ee nothing but uniformity, beauty, and
preci&s;ion. The heavens pre&s;ent us with a plan, which, though
inexpre&s;&s;ibly magnificent, is yet regular beyond the power of invention.
Whenever, therefore, we find any apparent defects in the earth, which we are
about to con&s;ider, in&s;tead of attempting to rea&s;on our&s;elves into an
opi|nion that they are beautiful, it will be wi&s;er to &s;ay, that we do not
behold them at the proper <PB N="8" REF="26"> point of di&s;tance, and that our
eye is laid too clo&s;e to the objects to take in the regularity of their
connexion. In &s;hort, we may conclude, that God, who is regular in his great
produc|tions, acts with equal uniformity in the little.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A &s;hort Survey of the Globe, from the Light of
A&s;tronomy and Geography.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the &s;ciences are in &s;ome mea&s;ure linked with each other,
and before the one is ended the other begins. In a natural hi&s;tory,
there|fore, of the earth, we mu&s;t begin with a &s;hort account of its
&s;ituation and form, as given us by a&s;tronomers and geographers: it will be
&s;ufficient, however, upon this occa&s;ion, ju&s;t to hint to the imagination,
what they, by the mo&s;t ab&s;tract rea&s;onings, have forced upon the
un|der&s;tanding. The earth which we inhabit is, as has been &s;aid before, one
of tho&s;e bodies which circulate in our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem; it is placed at an
happy middle di&s;tance from the centre; and even &s;eems, in this re&s;pect,
privi|leged beyond all other planets that depend upon our great luminary for
their &s;upport. Le&s;s di&s;tant from the &s;un than Saturn, Jupiter, 
<PB N="9" REF="27"> and Mars, and yet le&s;s parched up than Venus and Mercury,
that are &s;ituate too near the vio|lence of its power, the earth &s;eems in a
peculiar manner to &s;hare the bounty of the Creator: it is not, therefore,
without rea&s;on that man|kind con&s;ider them&s;elves as the peculiar objects
of his providence and regard.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that motion which the earth has round the &s;un, the
circuit of which is per|formed in a year, it has another upon its own axle,
which it performs in twenty-four hours. Thus, like a chariot-wheel, it has a
compound motion; for while it goes forward on its journey, it is all the while
turning upon it&s;elf. From the fir&s;t of the&s;e two ari&s;e the grateful
vici&s;&s;itude of the &s;ea&s;ons; from the &s;econd, that of day and
night.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o readily conceived, that a body thus wheeling in
circles will mo&s;t pro|bably be it&s;elf a &s;phere. The earth, beyond all
po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, is found to be &s;o. Whenever its &s;hadow happens to
fall upon the moon, in an eclip&s;e, it appears to be always circular, in
whatever po&s;ition it is projected: and it is ea&s;y to prove, that a body
which in every po&s;ition makes a circular &s;hadow, mu&s;t it&s;elf be round.
The rotundity of the earth may be al&s;o proved from the meeting of two &s;hips
at &s;ea: the top <PB N="10" REF="28"> ma&s;ts of each are the fir&s;t parts
that are di&s;co|vered by both, the under parts being hidden by the convexity
of the globe which ri&s;es between them. The &s;hips in this in&s;tance may be
re&s;embled to two men who approach each other on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of an
hill: their heads will fir&s;t be &s;een, and gradually as they come nearer
they will come entirely into view.</P>
<P>However, though the earth's figure is &s;aid to be &s;pherical, we
ought only to conceive it as being nearly &s;o. It has been found in the la&s;t
age to be rather flatted at both poles, &s;o that its form is commonly
re&s;embled to that of a turnep. The cau&s;e of this &s;welling of the equator
is a&s;cribed to the greater rapidity of the motion with which the parts of the
earth are there carried round; and which, con&s;equently, endeavouring to fly
off, act in oppo&s;ition to central attraction. The twirling of a mop may
&s;erve as an homely illu&s;tration; which, as every one has &s;een, &s;preads
and grows broader in the middle as it continues to be turned round.</P>
<P>As the earth receives light and motion from the &s;un, &s;o it
derives much of its warmth and power of vegetation from the &s;ame beneficent
&s;ource. However, the different parts of the globe participate of the&s;e
advantages in very <PB N="11" REF="29"> different proportions, and accordingly
put on very different appearances; a polar pro&s;pect, and a land&s;cape at the
equator, are as oppo&s;ite in their appearances as in their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The polar regions, that receive the &s;olar beams in a very oblique
direction, and that con|tinue for one half of the year in night, receive but
few of the genial comforts that other parts of the world enjoy. Nothing can be
more mournful or hideous than the picture which travellers pre&s;ent of tho&s;e
wretched regions. The ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Crantz's hi&s;tory
of Greenland, p. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>, which is rocky and barren, rears it&s;elf in
every place in lofty mountains and inacce&s;&s;ible cliffs, and meets the
mariner's eye at even forty leagues from &s;hore. The&s;e precipices, frightful
in them&s;elves, receive an additional horror from being con&s;tantly covered
with ice and &s;now, which daily &s;eem to ac|cumulate and to fill all the
vallies with encrea&s;|ing de&s;olation. The few rocks and cliffs, that are
bare of &s;now, look at a di&s;tance of a dark brown colour, and quite naked.
Upon a nearer approach, however, they are found re|plete with many different
veins of coloured &s;tone, and here and there &s;pread over with a little
earth, and a &s;canty portion of gra&s;s and heath. The internal parts of the
country are <PB N="12" REF="30"> &s;till more de&s;olate and deterring. In
wandering this &s;olitude, &s;ome plains appear covered with ice, that, at
fir&s;t glance, &s;eem to promi&s;e the traveller an ea&s;y journey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Crantz's hi&s;tory of Greenland, p. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>, But
the&s;e are even more formidable and more unpa&s;&s;able than the mountains
them&s;elves, being cleft with dreadful cha&s;ms, and every where abounding
with pits that threaten certain de&s;truction. The &s;eas that &s;urround
the&s;e inho&s;pitable coa&s;ts, are &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, being
covered with flakes of floating ice, that &s;pread like exten&s;ive fields, or
that ri&s;e out of the water like enormous mountains. The&s;e, which are
compo&s;ed of materials as clear and tran&s;parent as gla&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. 27.</BIBL></NOTE>, a&s;&s;ume many &s;trange and
phanta&s;tic appearances. Some of them look like churches or ca&s;tles, with
pointed turrets; &s;ome like &s;hips in full &s;ail; and people have often
given them&s;elves the fruitle&s;s toil to attempt piloting the imagi|nary
ve&s;&s;els into harbour. There are &s;till others that appear like large
i&s;lands, with plains, valleys, and hills, which often rear their heads two
hundred yards above the level of the &s;ea; and although the height of the&s;e
be amazing, yet their depth beneath is &s;till more &s;o; &s;ome of them being
found to &s;ink three hundred fathom under water.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="31">The earth pre&s;ents a very different
appear|ance at the equator, where the &s;un-beams, darting directly downwards,
burn up the lighter &s;oils into exten&s;ive &s;andy de&s;arts, or quicken all
the moi&s;ter tracts with incredible vegetation. In the&s;e regions, almo&s;t
all the &s;ame inconveni|encies are felt from the proximity of the &s;un, that
in the former were endured from its ab|&s;ence. The de&s;arts are entirely
barren except where they are found to produce &s;erpents, and that in &s;uch
quantities, that &s;ome exten&s;ive plains &s;eem almo&s;t entirely covered
with them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Adan&s;on's De&s;cription of

<P>It not unfrequently happens al&s;o that this dry &s;oil, which is
&s;o parched and comminuted by the force of the &s;un, ri&s;es with the
&s;malle&s;t breeze of wind; and the &s;ands being compo&s;ed of parts almo&s;t
as &s;mall as tho&s;e of water, they a&s;&s;ume a &s;imilar appearance, rolling
onward in waves like tho&s;e of a troubled &s;ea, and over|whelming all they
meet with inevitable de&s;truc|tion. On the other hand, tho&s;e tracts which
are fertile, teem with vegetation even to a noxious degree. The gra&s;s ri&s;es
to &s;uch an height as often to require burning; the fore&s;ts are
impa&s;&s;able from underwoods, and &s;o matted above, that even the &s;un,
fierce as it is, can &s;eldom penetrate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amaenit. vol. vi. p. 67.</BIBL></NOTE>. The&s;e are
&s;o thick as <PB N="14" REF="32"> &s;carce to be extirpated; for the tops
being &s;o bound together by the climbing plants that grow round them, though
an hundred &s;hould be cut at the bottom, yet not one would fall, as they
mutually &s;upport each other. In the&s;e dark and tangled fore&s;ts, bea&s;ts
of various kinds, in&s;ects in a&s;toni&s;hing abundance, and &s;erpents of
&s;urprizing magnitude, find a quiet retreat from man, and are &s;eldom
di&s;turbed except by each other.</P>
<P>In this manner the extremes of our globe &s;eem equally unfitted for
the comforts and con|veniencies of life; and, although the imagina|tion may
find an awful plea&s;ure in contemplat|ing the frightful precipices of
Greenland, or the luxurious verdure of Africa, yet true happi|ne&s;s can only
be found in the more moderate climates, where the gifts of nature may be
enjoyed without incurring danger in obtaining them.</P>
<P>It is in the temperate zone, therefore, that all the arts of
improving nature, and refining upon happine&s;s, have been invented: and this
part of the earth is, more properly &s;peaking, the theatre of natural
hi&s;tory. Although there be millions of animals and vegetables in the
unexplored fore&s;ts under the line, yet mo&s;t of the&s;e may for ever
continue unknown, as <PB N="15" REF="33"> curio&s;ity is there repre&s;&s;ed by
&s;urrounding danger. But it is otherwi&s;e in the&s;e delight|ful regions
which we inhabit, and where this art has had its beginning. Among us there is
&s;carce a &s;hrub, a flower, or an in&s;ect, without its particular hi&s;tory;
&s;carce a plant that could be u&s;eful that has not been propagated; nor a
weed that could be noxious which has not been pointed out.</P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. A View of the Surface of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a &s;light &s;urvey of the &s;ur|face of our globe, a
thou&s;and objects offer them&s;elves, which, though long known, yet &s;till
demand our curio&s;ity. The mo&s;t obvious beauty that every where &s;trikes
the eye is the verdant covering of the earth, which is formed by an happy
mixture of herbs and trees of va|rious magnitudes and u&s;es. It has been often
remarked that no colour refre&s;hes the &s;ight &s;o well as green; and it may
be added, as a further proof of the a&s;&s;ertion, that the inhabitants of
tho&s;e places where the fields are continually white with &s;now, generally
become blind long before the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="34">This advantage, which ari&s;es from the ver|dure
of the fields, is not a little improved by their agreeable inequalities. There
is &s;carce two natural land&s;capes that offer pro&s;pects en|tirely
re&s;embling each other; their ri&s;ings and depre&s;&s;ions, their hills and
valleys, are never entirely the &s;ame, but always offer &s;omething new to
entertain and refre&s;h the imagination.</P>
<P>But to encrea&s;e the beauties of the face of nature, the
land&s;cape is enlivened by &s;prings and lakes, and inter&s;ected by rivulets.
The&s;e lend a brightne&s;s to the pro&s;pect; give motion and coolne&s;s to
the air; and, what is much more important, furni&s;h health and
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence to animated nature.</P>
<P>Such are the mo&s;t obvious and tranquil objects that every where
offer: but there are others of a more awful and magnificent kind; the
<HI>Mountain</HI> ri&s;ing above the clouds, and topt with &s;now; the
<HI>River</HI> pouring down its &s;ides, encrea&s;ing as it runs, and lo&s;ing
it&s;elf, at la&s;t, in the ocean; the <HI>Ocean</HI> &s;preading its immen&s;e
&s;heet of waters over one half of the globe, &s;welling and &s;ub&s;iding at
well-known intervals, and forming a communication between the mo&s;t di&s;tant
parts of the earth.</P>
<P>If we leave tho&s;e objects that &s;eem to be natural to our earth,
and keep the &s;ame con|&s;tant <PB N="17" REF="35"> tenor, we are pre&s;ented
with the great irre|gularities of nature. The burning mountain; the abrupt
precipice; the unfathomable cavern; the headlong cataract; and the rapid
whirl|pool.</P>
<P>If we carry our curio&s;ity a little further, and de&s;cend to the
objects immediately below the &s;urface of the globe, we &s;hall there find
wonders &s;till as amazing. We fir&s;t perceive the earth for the mo&s;t part
lying in regular beds or layers, every bed growing thicker in proportion as it
lies deeper, and its contents more compact and heavy. We &s;hall find, almo&s;t
wherever we make our &s;ubterranean en|quiry, an amazing number of &s;hells
that once belonged to aquatic animals. Here and there, at a di&s;tance from the
&s;ea, beds of oy&s;ter-&s;hells, &s;everal yards thick, and many miles over;
&s;ometimes te&s;taceous &s;ub&s;tances of various kinds on the tops of
mountains, and often in the heart of the harde&s;t marble. The&s;e, which are
dug up by the pea&s;ants, in every country, are re|garded with little
curio&s;ity; for being &s;o very common, they are con&s;idered as
&s;ub&s;tances entirely terrene. But it is otherwi&s;e with the enquirer after
nature, who finds them, not only in &s;hape but in &s;ub&s;tance, every way
re&s;em|bling tho&s;e that are bred in the &s;ea; and he, <PB N="18" REF="36">
therefore, is at a lo&s;s to account for their re|moval.</P>
<P>Yet not one part of nature alone, but all her productions and
varieties, become the object of the &s;peculative man's enquiry: he takes
different views of nature from the inat|tentive &s;pectator; and &s;carce an
appearance, how common &s;oever, but affords matter for his contemplation: he
enquires how and why the &s;urface of the earth has come to have tho&s;e
ri&s;ings and depre&s;&s;ions which mo&s;t men call natural; he demands in what
manner the moun|tains were formed, and in what con&s;i&s;t their u&s;es; he
a&s;ks from whence &s;prings ari&s;e; and how rivers flow round the convexity
of the globe; he enters into an examination of the ebbings and flowings, and
the other wonders of the deep; he acquaints him&s;elf with the irregularities
of nature, and he will endeavour to inve&s;tigate their cau&s;es; by which, at
lea&s;t, he will become better ver&s;ed in their hi&s;tory. The internal
&s;tructure of the globe becomes an object of his curio&s;ity; and, although
his en|quiries can fathom but a very little way, yet, if po&s;&s;e&s;t with a
&s;pirit of theory, his imagination will &s;upply the re&s;t. He will endeavour
to account for the &s;ituation of the marine fo&s;&s;ils that are found in the
earth, and for the ap|pearance <PB N="19" REF="37"> of the different beds of
which it is compo&s;ed. The&s;e have been the enquiries that have &s;plendidly
employed many of the philo&s;ophers of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, Woodward, Burnet, Whi&s;ton, Kircher, Bourquat,
Leibnitz, Steno, Ray, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>; and, to a certain degree, they
mu&s;t be &s;erviceable. But the wor&s;t of it is, that, as &s;peculations
amu&s;e the writer more than facts, they may be often carried to an extravagant
length; and that time may be &s;pent in rea&s;oning upon nature, which might be
more u&s;efully employed in writing her hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Too much &s;peculation in natural hi&s;tory is certainly wrong; but
there is a defect of an oppo&s;ite nature that does much more pre|judice;
namely, that of &s;ilencing all enquiry, by alledging the benefits we receive
from a thing, in&s;tead of inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e of its production. If I
enquire how a mountain came to be made, &s;uch a rea&s;oner, enumerating its
benefits, an&s;wers, becau&s;e God knew it would be u&s;eful. If I demand the
cau&s;e of an earth|quake, he finds &s;ome good produced by it, and alledges
that as the cau&s;e of its explo&s;ion. Thus &s;uch an enquirer has
con&s;tantly &s;ome ready rea&s;on for every appearance in nature, which
&s;erves to &s;well his periods, and give &s;plendour <PB N="20" REF="38"> to
his declamation: every thing about him is, on &s;ome account or other, declared
to be good; and he thinks it pre&s;umption to &s;crutinize into its defects, or
to endeavour to imagine how it might be better. Such writers, and there are
many &s;uch, add very little to the advancement of knowledge; and it is finely
remarked by Bacon, that the inve&s;tigation of final cau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Inve&s;tigatio cau&s;arum finalium &s;terilis
e&s;t, et veluti virgo Deo dedicata, nil parit.</Q></NOTE> is a barren &s;tudy;
and, like a virgin dedicated to the Deity, brings forth nothing. In fact,
tho&s;e men who want to compel every appearance and every irregularity in
nature into our &s;ervice, and ex|patiate on their benefits, combat that very
morality which they would &s;eem to promote. God has permitted thou&s;ands of
natural evils to exi&s;t in the world, becau&s;e it is by their inter|vention
that man is capable of moral evil; and he has permitted that we &s;hould be
&s;ubject to moral evil, that we might do &s;omething to de|&s;erve eternal
happine&s;s by &s;hewing that we had rectitude to avoid it.</P>

<P>HUMAN invention has been exerci&s;ed for &s;everal ages to account

mentioned in the la&s;t chapter &s;ee nothing but beauty, &s;ymmetry, and
order; there are others, who look upon the gloomy &s;ide of nature, enlarge on
its defects, and &s;eem to con&s;ider the earth, on which they tread, as one

minerals and waters confu&s;edly jumbled together; its different beds of earth

were level<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Senec. Quae&s;t. lib. vi. cap.

&s;uppo&s;e to be but a few of the changes that have been wrought in our globe;
and they &s;end out immagination to de&s;cribe it in its primaeval &s;tate of
beauty.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who have written theories de&s;crib|ing the manner of the
original formation of the <PB N="22" REF="40"> earth, or accounting for its
pre&s;ent appearances, the mo&s;t celebrated are Burnet, Whi&s;ton, Woodward,
and Buffon. As &s;peculation is endle&s;s, &s;o it is not to be wondered that
all the&s;e differ from each other, and give oppo&s;ite accounts of the
&s;everal changes, which they &s;uppo&s;e our earth to have undergone. As the
&s;y&s;tems of each have had their admirers, it is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
incumbent upon the natural hi&s;torian to be acquainted, at lea&s;t, with their
out-lines; and, indeed, to know what others have even dreamed, in matters of
&s;cience, is very u&s;eful, as it may often prevent us from indulging
&s;imilar delu&s;ions our&s;elves, which we &s;hould never have adopted, but
be|cau&s;e we take them to be wholly our own. However, as entering into a
detail of the&s;e the|ories, is rather furni&s;hing an hi&s;tory of opinions
than things, I will endeavour to be as conci&s;e as I can.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who formed this amu&s;ement of earth-making into
&s;y&s;tem was the celebrated Thomas Burnet, a man of polite learning and rapid
immagination. His <HI>Sacred Theory,</HI> as he calls it, de&s;cribing the
changes which the earth has undergone, or &s;hall hereafter under|go, is well
known for the warmth with which it is immagined, and the weakne&s;s with which
it <PB N="23" REF="41"> is rea&s;oned, for the elegance of its &s;tyle, and the
meanne&s;s of its philo&s;ophy. The earth, &s;ays he, before the deluge, was
very differently formed from what it is at pre&s;ent: it was at fir&s;t a fluid
ma&s;s; a chaos compo&s;ed of various &s;ub|&s;tances, differing both in
den&s;ity and figure: tho&s;e which were mo&s;t heavy &s;unk to the center, and
formed in the middle of our globe an hard &s;olid body; tho&s;e of a lighter
nature remained next; and the waters, which were lighter &s;till, &s;wam upon
its &s;urface, and covered the earth on every &s;ide. The air, and all tho&s;e
fluids which were lighter than water, floated upon this al&s;o; and in the
&s;ame manner encompa&s;&s;ed the globe; &s;o that between the &s;urrounding
body of waters, and the circumambient air, there was formed a coat of oil, and
other unctuous &s;ub&s;tances, lighter than water. How|ever, as the air was
&s;till extremely impure, and mu&s;t have carried up with it many of tho&s;e
earthly particles with which it once was inti|mately blended, it &s;oon began
to defecate, and to depo&s;e the&s;e particles upon the only &s;urface already
mentioned, which &s;oon uniting together, the earth and oil formed that
cru&s;t, which &s;oon became an habitable &s;urface, giving life to vegetation,
and dwelling to animals.</P>
<P>This immaginary antideluvian abode was <PB N="24" REF="42"> very
different from what we &s;ee it at pre&s;ent. The earth was light and rich; and
formed of a &s;ub&s;tance entirely adapted to the feeble &s;tate of incipient
vegetation: it was an uni|form plain, every where covered with verdure; without
mountains, without &s;eas, or the &s;malle&s;t inequalities. It had no
difference of &s;ea&s;ons, for its equator was in the plain of the ecliptic,
or, in other words, it turned directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;un, &s;o that it
enjoyed one perpetual and luxuriant &s;pring. However, this delightful face of
nature did not long continue the &s;ame, for, after a time, it began to crack
and open in fi&s;&s;ures; a circum&s;tance which always &s;ucceeds when the
&s;un dries away the moi&s;ture from rich or mar&s;hy &s;ituations. The crimes
of man|kind had been for &s;ome time preparing to draw down the wrath of
Heaven; and they, at length, induced the Deity to defer repairing the&s;e
breaches in nature. Thus the cha&s;ms of the earth every day became wider, and,
at length, they penetrated to the great aby&s;s of waters; and the whole earth,
in a manner, fell in. Then en&s;ued a total di&s;order in the uniform beauty of
the fir&s;t creation, the terrene &s;urface of the globe being broken down: as
it &s;unk the waters gu&s;hed out into its place; the deluge became
univer&s;al; all mankind except eight per&s;ons <PB N="25" REF="43"> were
puni&s;hed with de&s;truction, and their po|&s;terity condemned to toil upon
the ruins of de&s;olated nature.</P>
<P>It only remains to mention the manner in which he relieves the earth
from this univer&s;al wreck, which would &s;eem to be as difficult as even its
fir&s;t formation. 
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e great ma&s;&s;es of earth falling into the
aby&s;s, drew down with them va&s;t quantities al&s;o of air; and by da&s;h|ing
again&s;t each other, and breaking into &s;mall parts by the repeated violence
of the &s;hock, they, at length, left between them large cavities filled with
nothing but air. The&s;e cavities, naturally offered a bed to receive the
influent waters; and in proportion as they filled, the face of the earth became
once more vi&s;ible. The higher parts of its broken &s;urface, now become the
tops of mountains, were the fir&s;t that appeared; the plains &s;oon after came
for|ward, and, at length, the whole globe was delivered from the waters, except
the places in the lowe&s;t &s;ituations; &s;o that the ocean and the &s;eas are
&s;till a part of the ancient aby&s;s that have not had a place to return.
I&s;lands and rocks are fragments of the earth's former cru&s;t; kingdoms and
continents are larger ma&s;&s;es of its broken &s;ub&s;tance; and all the
inequalities that are to be found on the &s;ur|face of the pre&s;ent earth, are
owing to the acci|dental <PB N="26" REF="44"> confu&s;ion into which both earth
and waters were then thrown.</Q></P>
<P>The next theori&s;t was Woodward, who, in his E&s;&s;ay towards a
Natural Hi&s;tory of the Earth, which was only de&s;igned to precede a greater
work, has endeavoured to give a more rational account of its appearances; and
was, in fact, much better furni&s;hed for &s;uch an under|taking than any of
his predece&s;&s;ors, being one of the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous naturali&s;ts of
his time. His little book, therefore, contains many im|portant facts, relative
to natural hi&s;tory, al|though his &s;y&s;tem may be weak and
groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>He begins by a&s;&s;erting that all terrene &s;ub|&s;tances are
di&s;po&s;ed in beds of various natures, lying horizontally one over the other,
&s;omewhat like the coats of an onion; that they are replete with &s;hells, and
other productions of the &s;ea: the&s;e &s;hells being found in the deepe&s;t
cavities, and on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains. From the&s;e
ob&s;ervations, which are warranted by experience, he proceeds to ob&s;erve,
that the&s;e &s;hells and extraneous fo&s;&s;ils are not produc|tions of the
earth, but are all actual remains of tho&s;e animals which they are known to
re&s;em|ble; that all the beds of the earth lie under each other, in the order
of their &s;pecific gra|vity; and that they are di&s;po&s;ed as if they had
been left there by &s;ub&s;iding waters. All the&s;e <PB N="27" REF="45">
a&s;&s;ertions he affirms with much earne&s;tne&s;s, although daily experience
contradicts him in &s;ome of them; particularly we find layers of &s;tone often
over the lighte&s;t &s;oils, and the &s;ofte&s;t earth under the harde&s;t
bodies. However, having taken it for granted, that all the layers of the earth
are found in the order of their &s;pecific gravity, the lighte&s;t at the top,
and the heavie&s;t next the centre, he con&s;ecquently a&s;&s;erts, and it will
not improbably follow, that all the &s;ub|&s;tances of which the earth is
compo&s;ed, were once in an actual &s;tate of di&s;&s;olution. This univer&s;al
di&s;&s;olution he takes to have happened at the time of the flood. He
&s;uppo&s;es that at that time a body of water, which was then in the center of
the earth, uniting with that which was found on the &s;urface, &s;o far
&s;eparated the terrene parts as to mix all together in one fluid ma&s;s; the
contents of which afterwards &s;inking according to their re&s;pective
gravities, produced the pre&s;ent appearances of the earth. Being aware,
however, of an objection that fo&s;&s;ile &s;ub&s;tances are not found
di&s;&s;olved, he exempts them from this univer&s;al di&s;&s;olution, and, for
that purpo&s;e, endeavours to &s;hew that the parts of animals have a
&s;tronger cohe&s;ion than tho&s;e of minerals; and that, while even the
harde&s;t rocks may be di&s;&s;olved, bones and &s;hells may &s;till continue
entire.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="46">So much for Wooodward; but of all the
&s;y&s;|tems which were publi&s;hed re&s;pecting the earth's formation, that of
Whi&s;ton was mo&s;t applaud|ed, and mo&s;t oppo&s;ed. Nor need we wonder; for
being &s;upported with all the parade of deep calculation, it awed the
ignorant, and produced the approbation of &s;uch as would be thought
otherwi&s;e, as it implied a knowledge of ab&s;tru&s;e learning, to be even
thought capable of com|prehending what the writer aimed at. In fact, it is not
ea&s;y to dive&s;t it of its mathematical garb; but tho&s;e who have had
lei&s;ure, have found the re&s;ult of our philo&s;opher's rea&s;oning to be
thus. He &s;uppo&s;es the earth to have been originally a comet; and he
con&s;iders the hi&s;tory of the creation, as given us in &s;cripture, to have
its commencement ju&s;t when it was taken by the hand of the Creator, to be
more regularly placed as a planet in our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem. Before that time,
he &s;uppo&s;es it to have been a globe without beauty or proportion; a world
in di&s;o&s;der; &s;ubject to all the vici&s;&s;itudes which comets endure;
&s;ome of which have been found, at dif|ferent times, a thou&s;and times hotter
than melted iron; at others, a thou&s;and times colder than ice. The&s;e
alternations of heat and cold, con|tinually melting and freezing the &s;urface
of the earth, he &s;uppo&s;es to have produced, to a certain 
<PB N="29" REF="47"> depth, a chaos entirely re&s;embling that de&s;cribed by
the poets, &s;urrounding the &s;olid contents of the earth, which &s;till
continued unchanged in the mid&s;t, making a great burning globe of more than
two thou&s;and leagues in diameter. This &s;urrounding chaos, however, was far
from being &s;olid: he re&s;embles it to a den&s;e though fluid atmo&s;phere,
compo&s;ed of &s;ub&s;tances mingled, agitated, and &s;hocked again&s;t each
other; and in this di&s;order he de&s;cribes the earth to have been ju&s;t at
the eve of creation.</P>
<P>But upon its orbit's being then changed, when it was more regularly
wheeled round the &s;un, every thing took its proper places; every part of the
&s;urrounding fluid then fell into a &s;ituation, in proportion as it was light
or heavy. The middle, or central part, which always re|mained unchanged,
&s;till continued &s;o, retaining a part of that heat which it received in its
primaeval approaches towards the &s;un; which heat, he calculates, may continue
for about &s;ix thou&s;and years. Next to this fell the heavier parts of the
chaotic atmo&s;phere, which &s;erve to &s;u&s;tain the lighter: but as in
de&s;cending they could not entirely be &s;eparated from many watery parts,
with which they were intimately mixed, they drew down a part of the&s;e al&s;o
with them; and the&s;e could not mount again after the <PB N="30" REF="48">
&s;urface of the earth was con&s;olidated: they, therefore, &s;urrounded the
heavy fir&s;t de&s;cend|ing parts, in the &s;ame manner as the&s;e &s;ur|round
the central globe. Thus the entire body of the earth is compo&s;ed mo&s;t
internally of a great burning globe: next which, is placed an heavy terrene
&s;ub&s;tance, that encom|pa&s;&s;es it; round which al&s;o is circumfu&s;ed a
body of water. Upon this body of waters, the cru&s;t of earth on which we
inhabit is placed: &s;o that, according to him, the globe is com|po&s;ed of a
number of coats, or &s;hells, one within the other, all of different
den&s;ities. The body of the earth being thus formed, the air, which is the
lighte&s;t &s;ub&s;tance of all, &s;urrounded its &s;urface; and the beams of
the &s;un darting through, produced that light which, we are told, fir&s;t
obeyed the Creator's command.</P>
<P>The whole oeconomy of the creation being thus adju&s;ted, it only
remained to account for the ri&s;ings and depre&s;&s;ions on the &s;urface of
the earth, with the other &s;eeming irregularities of its pre&s;ent appearance.
The hills and vallies are con&s;idered by him as formed by their pre&s;&s;ing
upon the internal fluid, which &s;u&s;tains the outward &s;hell of earth, with
greater or le&s;s weight: tho&s;e parts of the earth which are heavie&s;t,
&s;ink into the &s;ubjacent fluid more <PB N="31" REF="49"> deeply, and become
vallies: tho&s;e that are lighte&s;t, ri&s;e higher upon the earth's &s;urface,
and are called mountains.</P>
<P>Such was the face of nature before the de|luge; the earth was then
more fertile and po|pulous than it is at pre&s;ent; the life of man and animals
was extended to ten times its pre|&s;ent duration; and all the&s;e advantages
aro&s;e from the &s;uperior heat of the central globe, which ever &s;ince has
been cooling. As its heat was then in its full power, the genial prin|ciple was
al&s;o much greater than at pre&s;ent; vegetation and animal encrea&s;e were
carried on with more vigour; and all nature &s;eemed teeming with the &s;eeds
of life. But the&s;e phy|&s;ical advantages were only productive of moral evil;
the warmth which invigorated the body encrea&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ions and
appetites of the mind; and, as man became more powerful, he grew le&s;s
innocent. It was found nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h his depravity; and all living
creatures, except the fi&s;hes, who living in a cold element were not &s;ubject
to a &s;imilitude of guilt, were overwhelmed by the deluge in univer&s;al
de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>This deluge, which &s;imple believers are willing to a&s;cribe to a
miracle, philo&s;ophers have long been de&s;irous to account for by 
<PB N="32" REF="50"> natural cau&s;es: they have proved that the earth could
never &s;upply from any re&s;ervoir towards its center, nor the atmo&s;phere by
any di&s;|charge from above, &s;uch a quantity of water as would cover the
&s;urface of the globe to a cer|tain depth over the tops of our highe&s;t
moun|tains. Where, therefore, was all this water to be found? Whi&s;ton has
found enough, and more than a &s;ufficiency, in the tail of a comet; for he
&s;eems to alot comets a very active part in the great operations of
nature.</P>
<P>He calculates, with great &s;eeming preci|&s;ion, the year, the
month, and the day of the week on which this comet (which has paid the earth
&s;ome vi&s;its &s;ince, though at a kinder di&s;tance) involved our globe in
its tail. The tail he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a vaporous fluid &s;ub|&s;tance,
exhaled from the body of the comet, by the extreme heat of the &s;un, and
encrea&s;ing in proportion as it approached that great luminary. It was in this
that our globe was involved at the time of the deluge; and, as the earth
&s;till acted by its natural attraction, it drew to it&s;elf all the watery
vapours which were in the comet's tail; and the internal waters being al&s;o at
the &s;ame time let loo&s;e, in a very &s;hort &s;pace the tops of the
highe&s;t mountains were laid under the deep.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="51">The puni&s;hment of the deluge being thus
compleated, and all the guilty de&s;troyed, the earth, which had been broken by
the erup|tion of the internal waters, was al&s;o enlarged by the &s;ame; &s;o
that upon the comet's rece&s;s, there was found room &s;ufficient in the
internal aby&s;s for the rece&s;s of the &s;uperfluous waters; whither they all
retired, and left the earth uncovered, but in &s;ome re&s;pects changed,
par|ticularly in its figure, which, from being round, was now become oblate. In
this univer&s;al wreck of nature Noah &s;urvived, by a variety of happy
cau&s;es, to re-people the earth, and to give birth to a race of men &s;low in
believing ill-imagined theories of the earth.</P>
<P>After &s;o many theories of the earth, which had been publi&s;hed,
applauded, an&s;wered, and forgotten, Mr. Buffon ventured to add one more to
the number. This philo&s;opher was, in every re&s;pect, better qualified than
any of his predece&s;&s;ors for &s;uch an attempt, being furni&s;hed with more
materials, having a brighter imagination to find new proofs, and a better
&s;tyle to cloath them in. However, if one &s;o ill qualified, as I am, may
judge, this &s;eems the weake&s;t part of his admirable work; and I could
wi&s;h, that he had been content with giving us facts in&s;tead of &s;y&s;tems;
that, in|&s;tead <PB N="34" REF="52"> of being a rea&s;oner, he had contented
him&s;elf with being merely an hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>He begins his &s;y&s;tem by making a di&s;tinction between the
fir&s;t part of it and the la&s;t; the one being founded only on conjecture,
the other depending entirely upon actual ob&s;ervation. The latter part of his
theory may, therefore, be true, though the former &s;hould be found
erroneous.</P>
<P>The planets, &s;ays he, and the earth, among the number, might have
been formerly (he only offers this as conjecture) a part of the body of the
&s;un, and adherent to its &s;ub&s;tance. In this &s;ituation, a comet falling
in upon that great body might have given it &s;uch a &s;hock, and &s;o &s;haken
its whole frame, that &s;ome of its particles might have been driven off like
&s;treaming &s;parkles from red hot iron; and each of the&s;e &s;treams of
fire, &s;mall as they were in compari&s;on of the &s;un, might have been large
enough to have made an earth as great, nay many times greater than ours. So
that in this manner the planets, together with the globe which we inhabit,
might have been driven off from the body of the &s;un by an impul&s;ive force:
in this manner al&s;o they would continue to recede from it for ever, were they
not drawn back by its &s;uperior power of attraction; and <PB N="35" REF="53">
thus, by the combination of the two motions, they are wheeled round in
circles.</P>
<P>Being in this manner detached at a di&s;tance from the body of the
&s;un, the planets, from having been at fir&s;t globes of liquid fire,
gra|dually became cool. The earth al&s;o having been da&s;hed obliquely
forward, received a rotatory motion upon its axis at the very in&s;tant of its
formation, and this motion being greate&s;t at the equator, the parts there
acting again&s;t the force of gravity, they mu&s;t have &s;wollen out, and
given the earth an oblate or flatted figure.</P>
<P>As to its internal &s;ub&s;tance, our globe having once belonged to
the &s;un, it continues to be an uniform ma&s;s of melted matter, very
pro|bably vitrified in its primaeval fu&s;ion. But its &s;urface is very
differently compo&s;ed. Having been in the beginning heated to a degree equal
to, if not greater than what comets are found to &s;u&s;tain; like them it had
an atmo&s;phere of vapours floating round it, and which cooling by degrees,
conden&s;ed and &s;ub&s;ided upon its &s;ur|face. The&s;e vapours formed,
according to their different den&s;ities, the earth, the water, and the air;
the heavier parts falling fir&s;t, and the lighter remaining &s;till
&s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="54">Thus far our philo&s;opher is, at lea&s;t, as
much a &s;y&s;tem maker as Whi&s;ton or Burnet; and, indeed, he fights his way
with great per&s;eve|rance and ingenuity through a thou&s;and ob|jections that
naturally ari&s;e. Having, at la&s;t, got upon the earth, he &s;uppo&s;es
him&s;elf on firmer ground, and goes forward with greater &s;ecurity. Turning
his attention to the pre&s;ent appearance of things upon this globe, he
pro|nounces from the view that the whole earth was at fir&s;t under water. This
water he &s;uppo&s;es to have been the lighter parts of its former evaporation,
which, while the earthy particles &s;unk downwards by their natural gravity,
floated on the &s;urface, and covered it for a con&s;idera|ble &s;pace of
time.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;urface of the earth," &s;ays he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Theorie de la Terre, vol. 1, p. 111.</BIBL></NOTE>, "mu&s;t

tops of our highe&s;t mountains, &s;ince, even in &s;uch <PB N="37" REF="55">
elevated &s;ituations, we find &s;hells and other marine productions in very
great abundance. It appears al&s;o that the &s;ea continued for a
con&s;iderable time upon the face of the earth: for as the&s;e layers of
&s;hells are found &s;o very frequent at &s;uch great depths, and in &s;uch
pro|digious quantities, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e to have
&s;upported their numbers all alive at one time; &s;o that they mu&s;t have
been brought there by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive depo&s;itions. The&s;e &s;hells al&s;o
are found in the bodies of the harde&s;t rocks, where they could not have been
depo&s;ited, all at once, at the time of deluge, or at any &s;uch in&s;tant
revolution; &s;ince that would be to &s;up|po&s;e, that all the rocks in which
they are found, were, at that in&s;tant, in a &s;tate of di&s;&s;olution; which
would be ab&s;urd to a&s;&s;ert. The &s;ea, therefore, depo&s;ited them
where&s;oever they are now to be found, and that by &s;low and
&s;ucce&s;|&s;ive degrees. 
<P>It will appear, al&s;o, that the &s;ea covered the whole earth,
from the appearance of its layers, which lying regularly one above the other,
&s;eem all to re&s;emble the &s;ediment formed at different times by the ocean.
Hence, by the irregular force of its waves, and its currents driving the bottom
into &s;and-banks, mountains mu&s;t have been gradually formed within this
univer&s;al <PB N="38" REF="56"> covering of waters; and the&s;e
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively rai&s;|ing their heads above its &s;urface, mu&s;t, in time,
have formed the highe&s;t ridges of mountains upon land, together with
continents, i&s;lands, and low grounds, all in their turns. This opi|nion will
receive additional weight by con&s;i|dering, that in tho&s;e parts of the earth
where the power of the ocean is greate&s;t, the inequa|lities on the &s;urface
of the earth are highe&s;t: the ocean's power is greate&s;t at the equator,
where its winds and tides are mo&s;t con&s;tant; and, in fact, the mountains at
the equator are found to be higher than in any other part of the world. The
&s;ea, therefore, has produced the principal changes in our earth: rivers,
volcanoes, earthquakes, &s;torms, and rain, hav|ing made but &s;light
alterations, and only &s;uch as have affected the globe to very

<P>This is but a very &s;light &s;ketch of Mr. Buf|fon's Theory of the

<P>WE may affirm of Mr. Buffon, that which has been &s;aid of the

compen&s;ation even while it feels the want of conviction.</P>
<P>Before, therefore, I enter upon the de&s;crip|tion of tho&s;e parts

not be improper to give a &s;hort hi&s;tory of tho&s;e animal productions that

natural hi&s;tory that has afforded more &s;cope for doubt, conjec|ture, and
&s;peculation. Whatever depths of the earth we examine, or at whatever
di&s;tance within land we &s;eek, we mo&s;t commonly find a number of
fo&s;&s;il-&s;hells, which being compared with others from the &s;ea, of known
kinds, are found to be exactly of a &s;imilar &s;hape and nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward's E&s;&s;ay towards a Natural Hi&s;tory, p.

the mo&s;t retired and inward parts of the mo&s;t firm and &s;olid rocks, upon
the tops of even the highe&s;t hills and mountains, as well as in the valleys

<P>With this plau&s;ible &s;olution mankind were for a long time
content; but upon clo&s;er en|quiry, they were obliged to alter their opinion.
It was found that the&s;e &s;hells had, in every re|&s;pect, the properties of
animal and not of mine|ral nature. They were found exactly of the &s;ame weight
with their fellow &s;hells upon &s;hore. They an&s;wered all the chymical
trials in the &s;ame manner as &s;ea &s;hells do. Their parts, when
di&s;&s;olved, had the &s;ame appearance to view, the &s;ame &s;mell and
ta&s;te. They had the <PB N="42" REF="60"> &s;ame effects in medicine when
inwardly admi|ni&s;tered; and, in a word, were &s;o exactly con|formable to
marine bodies, that they had all the accidental concretions growing to them,
(&s;uch as pearls, corals, and &s;maller &s;hells) which are found in &s;hells
ju&s;t gathered on the &s;hore. They were, therefore, from the&s;e
con&s;iderations, again given back to the &s;ea; but the wonder was, how to
account for their coming &s;o far from their own natural element upon land<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward, p. 43.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As this naturally gave ri&s;e to many conjec|tures, it is not to be
wondered that &s;ome among them have been very extraordinary. An Italian,
quoted by Mr. Buffon, &s;uppo&s;es them to have been depo&s;ited in the earth
at the time of the cru&s;ades, by the pilgrims who re|turned from Jeru&s;alem;
who gathering them upon the &s;ea-&s;hore, in their return carried them to
their different places of habitation. But this conjecturer &s;eems to have but
a very inadequate idea of their numbers. At Touraine, in France, more than an
hundred miles from the &s;ea, there is a plain of about nine leagues long, and
as many broad, from whence the pea&s;ants of the country &s;upply them&s;elves
with marle for <PB N="43" REF="61"> manuring their lands. They &s;eldom dig
deeper than twenty feet, and the whole plain is compo&s;ed of the &s;ame
materials, which are &s;hells of various kinds, without the &s;malle&s;t
portion of earth between them. Here, then, is a large &s;pace, in which are
depo&s;ited millions of tons of &s;hells, which pilgrims could not have
collected though their whole employment had been nothing el&s;e. England is
furni&s;hed with its beds, which though not quite &s;o exten|&s;ive, yet are
equally wonderful.

only &s;hells in our pits, but al&s;o fi&s;hes and corals in great abundance;
together with almo&s;t every &s;ort of marine production.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary enough, however, that the common red coral,
though &s;o very fre|quent at &s;ea, is &s;carce &s;een in the fo&s;&s;il
world; nor is there any account of its hav|ing ever been met with. But to
recompence for this, there are all the kinds of the white coral now known; and
many other kinds of that &s;ub&s;tance with which we are unacquainted. Of
animals there are various parts; the vertebrae of whales, and the mouths of
le&s;&s;er fi&s;hes; the&s;e, <PB N="47" REF="65"> with teeth al&s;o of various

the page of in&s;tructive hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e in&s;tances we &s;ee in what abun|dance the&s;e
petrefactions are to be found; and, indeed, Mr. Buffon, to who&s;e accounts we
have added &s;ome, has not been &s;paring in the variety of his quotations,
concerning the places where they are mo&s;tly to be found. However, I am
&s;urprized that he &s;hould have omitted the mention of one, which, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, more than any of the re&s;t, would have &s;erved to &s;trengthen his
theory. We are in|formed, by almo&s;t every traveller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t, Sandys.</BIBL></NOTE>, that has
de&s;cribed the pyramids of Egypt, that one of them is entirely built of a kind
of free-&s;tone, <PB N="48" REF="66"> in which the&s;e petrified &s;hells are
found in great abundance. This being the ca&s;e, it may be con|jectured, as we
have accounts of the&s;e pyra|mids among the earlie&s;t records of mankind, and
of their being built &s;o long before the age of Herodotus, who lived but
fifteen hundred years after the flood, that even the Egyptian prie&s;ts could
tell neither the time nor the cau&s;e of their erection; I &s;ay it may be
conjectured that they were erected but a &s;hort time after the flood. It is
not very likely, therefore, that the marine &s;ub&s;tances found in one of
them, had time to be formed into a part of the &s;olid &s;tone, either during
the deluge, or immediately after it; and, con&s;equently, their petrefaction
mu&s;t have been before that period. And this is the opinion Mr. Buffon has all
along &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured to maintain; having given &s;pecious
rea&s;ons to prove, that &s;uch &s;hells were laid in the beds where they are
now found, not only before the deluge, but even antecedent to the formation of
man, at the time when the whole earth, as he &s;uppo&s;es, was buried beneath a
covering of waters.</P>
<P>But while there are many rea&s;ons to per&s;uade us that the&s;e
extraneous fo&s;&s;ils have been de|po&s;ited by the &s;ea, there is one fact
that will <PB N="49" REF="67"> abundantly &s;erve to convince us that the earth
was habitable, if not inhabited, before the&s;e ma|rine &s;ub&s;tances came to
be thus depo&s;ited. For we find fo&s;&s;il trees, which no doubt once grew
upon the earth, as deep, and as much in the body of &s;olid rocks, as the&s;e
&s;hells are found to be. Some of the&s;e fallen trees al&s;o, have lain at
lea&s;t as long, if not longer, in the earth, than the &s;hells as they have
been found &s;unk deep in a marly &s;ub&s;tance, compo&s;ed of decayed
&s;hells, and other marine productions. Mr. Buffon has proved that fo&s;&s;il
&s;hells could not have been depo&s;ited in &s;uch quantities all at once by
the flood; and I think, from the above in&s;tance, it is pretty plain, that,
how&s;oever they were de|po&s;ited, the earth was covered with trees before
their depo&s;ition; and, con&s;equently, that the &s;ea could not have made a
very permanent &s;tay. How then &s;hall we account for the&s;e extraor|dinary
appearances in nature? A &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all a&s;&s;ent is certainly the
fir&s;t, although the mo&s;t mortifying conduct. For my own part, were I to
offer a conjecture, and all that has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject is but
conjecture, in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing them to be the remains of animals
belonging to the &s;ea, I would con&s;ider them rather as bred in the numerous
fre&s;h-water lakes <PB N="50" REF="68"> that, in primaeval times, covered the
face of uncultivated nature. Some of the&s;e &s;hells we know to belong to
fre&s;h waters: &s;ome can be a&s;&s;imilated to none of the marine &s;hells
now known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's Fo&s;&s;ils, p.
641.</BIBL></NOTE>; why, therefore, may we not as well a&s;cribe the production
of all to fre&s;h waters, where we do not find them, as we do that of the
latter to the &s;ea only, where we never find them? We know that lakes, and
lands al&s;o, have produced animals that are now no longer exi&s;ting, why,
therefore, might not the&s;e fo&s;&s;il productions be among the number? I
grant that this is making a very har&s;h &s;uppo&s;ition; but I cannot avoid
thinking, that it is not at|tended with &s;o many embarra&s;&s;ments as &s;ome
of the former, and that it is much ea&s;ier to be|lieve that the&s;e &s;hells
were bred in fre&s;h water, than that the &s;ea had for a long time covered the
tops of the highe&s;t mountains.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the internal Structure of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, got free from the regions of

by examination, and ob&s;erve its internal compo&s;ition, as far as it has been
the &s;ubject of experience, or expo&s;ed to human enquiry. The&s;e enquiries,
indeed, have been carried but to a very little depth below its &s;urface, and
even in that di&s;qui&s;ition men have been con|ducted more by motives of
avarice than of curio&s;ity. The deepe&s;t mine, which is that at Cotteberg in
Hungary<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
240.</BIBL></NOTE>, reaches not more than three thou&s;and feet deep; but what
proportion does that bear to the depth of the terre&s;trial globe, down to the
centre, which is above four thou&s;and miles? All, therefore, that has been
&s;aid of the earth, to a deeper degree, is merely fabulous or conjectural: we
may &s;up|po&s;e with one, that it is a globe of gla&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>; with another, a &s;phere of heated
iron<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Whi&s;ton.</BIBL></NOTE>; with

volcano<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher.</BIBL></NOTE>; but let
us, at the &s;ame time, &s;hew our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that all the&s;e are
but &s;uppo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Upon examining the earth, where it has been opened to any depth, the
fir&s;t thing that occurs, is the different layers or beds of which it is
compo&s;ed: the&s;e all lying horizontally one over the other like the leaves
of a book, and each of them compo&s;ed of materials that encrea&s;e in weight
in proportion as they lie deeper. This is, in general, the di&s;po&s;ition of
the different ma|terials where the earth &s;eems to have remained unmole&s;ted;
but this order is frequently in|verted; and we cannot tell whether from its
ori|ginal formation, or from accidental cau&s;es. Of different &s;ub&s;tances,
thus di&s;po&s;ed, the far greate&s;t part of our globe con&s;i&s;ts, from its
&s;urface downwards to the greate&s;t depths we ever dig or mine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Woodward, p. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t layer that is mo&s;t commonly found at the &s;urface, is
that light coat of blacki&s;h mold, which is called, by &s;ome, garden earth.
With this the earth is every where inve&s;ted, unle&s;s it be wa&s;hed off by
rains, or removed by &s;ome other external violence. This &s;eems to have been
formed from animal and vegetable <PB N="53" REF="71"> bodies decaying, and thus
turning into its &s;ub|&s;tance. It al&s;o &s;erves again as a &s;tore-hou&s;e,
from whence animal and vegetable nature are re|newed, and thus are all vital
ble&s;&s;ings continued with uncea&s;ing circulation. This earth, however, is
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed entirely pure, but is mixed up with much &s;tony and
gravelly matter from the layers lying immediately beneath it. It generally
happens, that the &s;oil is fertile in proportion to the quantity that this
putrified mold bears to the gravelly mixture; and as the former predominates,
&s;o far is the vegetation upon it more luxuriant. It is this external covering
that &s;upplies man with all the true riches he enjoys. He may bring up gold
and jewels from greater depths; but they are merely the toys of a capricious
being, things upon which he has placed an imaginary value, and for which fools
alone part with the more &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings of life. It is this
earth, &s;ays Pliny<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plinii Naturalis
Hi&s;toria, lib. 2, cap. 63.</BIBL></NOTE>, that, like a kind mother, receives
us at our birth, and &s;u&s;tains us when born. It is this alone, of all the
ele|ments around us, that is never found an ene|my to man. The body of waters
deluge him with rains, oppre&s;s him with hail, and drown him with inundations.
The air ru&s;hes in &s;torms, <PB N="54" REF="72"> prepares the tempe&s;t, or
lights up the volca|no; but the earth, gentle and indulgent, ever
&s;ub&s;ervient to the wants of man, &s;preads his walks with flowers, and his
table with plenty; returns with intere&s;t every good committed to her care;
and, though &s;he produces the poi&s;on, &s;he &s;till &s;upplies the antidote;
though con&s;tantly teized more to furni&s;h the luxuries of man than his
nece&s;&s;ities, yet, even to the la&s;t, &s;he continues her kind indulgence,
and, when life is over, &s;he piou&s;ly covers his remains in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>This external and fruitful layer which covers the earth, is, as was
&s;aid, in a &s;tate of conti|nual change. Vegetables, which are naturally
fixed and rooted to the &s;ame place, receive their adventitious nouri&s;hment
from the &s;urrounding earth and water: animals, which change from place to
place, are &s;upported by the&s;e, or by each other. Both, however, having for
a time enjoyed a life adapted to their nature, give back to the earth tho&s;e
&s;poils, which they had bor|rowed for a very &s;hort &s;pace, yet &s;till to
be quick|ened again into fre&s;h exi&s;tence. But the depo&s;its they make are
of very di&s;&s;imilar kinds, and the earth is very differently enriched by
their con|tinuance. Tho&s;e countries that have for a long time &s;upported men
and other animals, having been ob&s;erved to become every day more bar|ren, 
<PB N="55" REF="73"> while, on the contrary, tho&s;e de&s;olate places, in
which vegetables only are abundantly produced, are known to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of
amazing fertility. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. i.
353.</BIBL></NOTE>"In regions which are uninhabit|ed," &s;ays Mr. Buffon,
"where the fore&s;ts are not cut down, and where animals do not feed upon the
plants, the bed of vegetable earth is con|&s;tantly encrea&s;ing. In all woods,
and even in tho&s;e which are often cut, there is a layer of earth of &s;ix or
eight inches thick, which has been formed by the leaves, branches and bark,
which fall and rot upon the ground. I have frequently ob&s;erved on a Roman way
that cro&s;&s;es Burgundy for a long extent, that there is a bed of black
earth, of more than a foot thick, gathered over the &s;tony pavement, on which
&s;everal trees, of a very con&s;iderable &s;ize, are &s;upported. This I have
found to be nothing el&s;e than an earth formed by decayed leaves and branches,
which have been converted by time into a black &s;oil. Now as vegetables draw
much more of their nouri&s;hment from the air and water than they do from the
earth, it mu&s;t follow, that in rotting upon the ground, they mu&s;t give more
to the &s;oil than they have taken from it. Hence, therefore, in woods kept a
long time without cutting, the &s;oil below <PB N="56" REF="74"> encrea&s;es to
a con&s;iderable depth; and &s;uch we actually find the &s;oil in tho&s;e
American wilds where the fore&s;ts have been undi&s;turbed for ages. But it is
otherwi&s;e where men and ani|mals have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; for as they make
a con&s;iderable con&s;umption of wood and plants, both for firing and other
u&s;es, they take more from the earth than they return to it: it follows,
therefore, that the bed of vegetable earth, in an inhabited country, mu&s;t be
always dimi|ni&s;hing; and mu&s;t, at length, re&s;emble the &s;oil of Arabia
Petrea, and other provinces of the Ea&s;t, which having been long inhabited,
are now become plains of &s;alt and &s;and; the fixed &s;alt always remaining
while the other vo|latile parts have flown away."</Q></P>
<P>If from this external &s;urface we de&s;cend deeper, and view the
earth cut perpendicularly downwards, either in the banks of great rivers, or
&s;teepy &s;ea-&s;hores; or, going &s;till deeper, if we ob&s;erve it in
quarries or mines, we &s;hall find its layers regularly di&s;po&s;ed in their
proper or|der. We mu&s;t not expect, however, to find them of the &s;ame kind
or thickne&s;s in every place, as they differ in different &s;oils and
&s;ituations. Sometimes marle is &s;een to be over &s;and, and &s;ometimes
under it. The mo&s;t com|mon di&s;po&s;ition is, that under the fir&s;t earth 
<PB N="57" REF="75"> is found gravel or &s;and, then clay or marle, then chalk
or coal, marbles, oars, &s;ands, gra|vels, and thus an alternation of the&s;e
&s;ub|&s;tances, each growing more den&s;e as it &s;inks deeper. The clay, for
in&s;tance, found at the depth of an hundred feet, is u&s;ually more heavy than
that found not far from the &s;urface. In a well which was dug at Am&s;terdam,
to the depth of two hundred and thirty feet, the fol|lowing &s;ub&s;tances were
found in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varenius, as quoted by

<P>In a well dug at Marly, to the depth of an hundred feet, Mr. Buffon
gives us a &s;till more exact enumeration of its layers of earth. 
<Q REND="inline">Thir|teen of a reddi&s;h gravel, two of gravel

<P>In this manner the earth is every where found in beds over beds;
and, what is &s;till remark|able, each of them, as far as it extends, always
maintains exactly the &s;ame thickne&s;s. It is found al&s;o, that, as we
proceed to con&s;iderable depths, every layer grows thicker. Thus in the
adduced in&s;tances we might have ob&s;erved, that the la&s;t layer was fifteen
feet thick, while mo&s;t of the others were not above eight, and this might
have gone much deeper, for aught we can tell, as before they got through it the

<P>The&s;e layers are &s;ometimes very exten&s;ive, and often are found
to obtain over a &s;pace of &s;ome leagues in circumference. But it mu&s;t 
<PB N="59" REF="77"> not be &s;uppo&s;ed that they are uniformly conti|nued
over the whole globe without any inter|ruption: on the contrary, they are ever,
at &s;mall intervals, cracked through as it were by perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures;
the earth re&s;embling, in this re&s;pect, the muddy bottom of a pond, from
whence the water has been dried off by the &s;un, and thus gaping in &s;everal
chinks, which de&s;cend in a direction perpendicular to its &s;urface. The&s;e
fi&s;&s;ures are many times found empty, but oftener clo&s;ed up with
ad|ventitious &s;ub&s;tances, that the rain, or &s;ome other accidental
cau&s;es, have conveyed to fill their cavities. Their openings are not le&s;s
different than their contents, &s;ome being not above half an inch wide, &s;ome
a foot, and &s;ome &s;everal hundred yards a&s;under. The&s;e la&s;t form
tho&s;e dreadful cha&s;ms that are to be found in the Alps, at the edge of
which the traveller &s;tands dreading to look down at the immea&s;urable gulph
below. The&s;e amazing clefts are well known to &s;uch as have pa&s;t the&s;e
mountains, where a cha&s;m frequently pre&s;ents it&s;elf &s;everal hundred
feet deep, and as many over, at the edge of which the way lies. It often
happens al&s;o, that the road leads along the bottom, and then the &s;pectator
ob&s;erves on each &s;ide frightful precipices &s;everal hundred 
<PB N="60" REF="78"> yards above him; the &s;ides of which tally &s;o exactly
with each other, that they evidently &s;eem torn a&s;under.</P>
<P>But the&s;e cha&s;ms to be found in the Alps, are nothing to what
Ovalle tells us are to be &s;een in the Andes. The&s;e amazing mountains, in
compari&s;on of which the former are but little hills, have their fi&s;&s;ures
in proportion to their greatne&s;s. In &s;ome places they are a mile wide, and
deep in proportion; and there are &s;ome others, that running underground, in
extent re&s;emble a province.</P>
<P>Of this kind al&s;o is that cavern called Elden-hole, in
Derby&s;hire; which, Dr. Plot tells us, was &s;ounded by a line of eight and
twenty hundred feet, without finding the bottom, or meeting with water: and yet
the mouth at the top is not above forty yards over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p. 370.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
im|mea&s;urable cavern runs perpendicularly down|ward; and the &s;ides of it
&s;eem totally &s;o plainly as to &s;hew that they once were united. Tho&s;e
who come to vi&s;it the place, generally procure &s;tones to be thrown into its
mouth; and the&s;e are heard for &s;everal minutes, falling and &s;triking
again&s;t the &s;ides of the cavern, producing a &s;ound that re&s;embles

world, abundantly &s;up|ply us. The generality of readers, however, will
con&s;ider them with le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, when they are informed of their
being common all <PB N="62" REF="80"> over the earth: that in every field, in
every quarry, the&s;e perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures are to be found; either
&s;till gaping, or filled with matter that has accidentally clo&s;ed their
inter&s;tices. The inattentive &s;pectator neglects the enquiry, but their
being common is partly the cau&s;e that excites the philo&s;opher's attention
to them; the irregularities of nature he is often content to let pa&s;s
unexamined; but when a con&s;tant and a common appearance pre&s;ents it&s;elf,
every return of the object is a fre&s;h call to his curio&s;ity; and the chink
in the next quarry becomes as great a matter of wonder as the cha&s;m in
Elden-hole. Philo&s;ophers have long, therefore, endeavoured to find out the
cau&s;e of the&s;e perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, which our own countrymen,
Woodward and Ray, were the fir&s;t that found to be &s;o com|mon and
univer&s;al. Mr. Buffon &s;uppo&s;es them to be cracks made by the &s;un, in
drying up the earth immediately after its emer&s;ion from the deep. The heat of
the &s;un is very probably a principal cau&s;e; but it is not right to
a&s;cribe to one only, what we find may be the re&s;ult of many. Earthquakes,
&s;evere fro&s;ts, bur&s;ting waters, and &s;torms tearing up the roots of
trees, have, in our own times, produced them: and to this variety of cau&s;es,
we mu&s;t, at pre&s;ent, be content to a&s;&s;ign tho&s;e that have happened
before we had opportunities for ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Caves and &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages that
&s;ink, but not perpendicularly, into the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;urveying the &s;ubterranean wonders of the globe, be&s;ides
tho&s;e fi&s;&s;ures that de&s;cend perpen|dicularly downwards, we frequently
find others that de&s;cend but a little way, and then &s;pread them&s;elves
often to a great extent below the &s;urface. Many of the&s;e caverns, it mu&s;t
be con|fe&s;&s;ed, may be the production of art and human indu&s;try; retreats
made to protect the oppre&s;&s;ed, or &s;helter the &s;poiler. The famous
labyrinth of Candia, for in&s;tance, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be en|tirely the work
of art. Mr. Tournefort a&s;&s;ures us, that it bears the impre&s;&s;ion of
human in|du&s;try, and that great pains have been be&s;towed upon its
formation. The &s;tone-quarry of Mae&s;tricht is evidently made by labour:
carts enter at its mouth, and load within, then return and di&s;charge their
freight into boats that lie on the brink of the river Mae&s;e. This quarry is
&s;o large, that forty thou&s;and people may take &s;helter in it: and it in
general &s;erves for this purpo&s;e, when armies march that way; becom|ing then
an impregnable retreat to the people <PB N="64" REF="82"> that live thereabout.
Nothing can be more beautiful than this cavern, when lighted up with torches;
for there are thou&s;ands of &s;quare pillars, in large level walks, about
twenty feet high; and all wrought with much neatne&s;s and regularity. In this
va&s;t grotto there is very little rubbi&s;h; which &s;hews both the goodne&s;s
of the &s;tone, and the carefulne&s;s of the workmen. To add to its beauty,
there al&s;o are in various parts of it, little pools of water, for the
con|venience of the men and cattle. It is remark|able al&s;o, that no droppings
are &s;een to fall from the roof, nor are the walks any way wet under foot,
except in ca&s;es of great rains, where the water gets in by the air &s;hafts.
The Salt mines in Poland are &s;till more &s;pacious than the&s;e. Some of the
catacombs, both in Egypt and Italy, are &s;aid to be very exten&s;ive. But no
part of the world has a greater number of artificial caverns than Spain, which
were made to &s;erve as retreats to the Chri&s;tians, again&s;t the fury of the
Moors, when the latter conquered that country. However, an account of the works
of art, does not properly belong to a natural hi&s;tory. It will be enough to
ob&s;erve, that though caverns be found in every country, far the greate&s;t
part of them have been fa&s;hioned only by the hand of Nature. Their &s;ize is
found beyond the <PB N="65" REF="83"> power of man to have effected; and their
forms but ill adapted to the conveniences of an human habitation. In &s;ome
places, indeed, we find mankind &s;till make u&s;e of them as hou&s;es;
par|ticularly in tho&s;e countries where the climate is very &s;evere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p. 368.</BIBL></NOTE>; but in
general they are de&s;erted by every race of meaner animals, except the bat;
the&s;e nocturnal &s;olitary creatures are u&s;u|ally the only inhabitants; and
the&s;e only in &s;uch who&s;e de&s;cent is &s;loping, or, at lea&s;t, not
directly perpendicular.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a country in the world with|out its natural
caverns; and many new cries are di&s;covered every day. Of tho&s;e in England,
Oakey-hole, The Devil's-hole, and Penpark-hole, have been often de&s;cribed.
The former, which lies on the &s;outh &s;ide of Mendip-hills<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, within a mile of the town of Wells, is
much re|&s;orted to by travellers. To conceive a ju&s;t idea of this, we mu&s;t
imagine a precipice of more than an hundred yards high, on the &s;ide of a
mountain which &s;helves away a mile above it. In this is an opening not very
large, into which you enter, going along upon a rocky uneven pavement,
&s;ometimes a&s;cending, and &s;ometimes de&s;cending. The roof of it, as you
advance, grows higher; and, in &s;ome places, is fifty feet <PB N="66" REF="84"> from the floor. In &s;ome places, however, it is &s;o low that a man
mu&s;t &s;toop to pa&s;s. It ex|tends it&s;elf, in length, about two hundred
yards; and from every part of the roof, and the floor, there are formed
&s;parry concretions of various figures, that by &s;trong imaginations have
been likened to men, lion, and organs. At the far|the&s;t part of this cavern
ri&s;es a &s;tream of water, well &s;tored with fi&s;h, large enough to turn a
mill, and which di&s;charges it&s;elf near the entrance.</P>
<P>Penpark-hole, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, is almo&s;t as remarkable as
the former. Captain Sturmey de&s;cended into this by a rope, twenty-five
fa|thoms perpendicular, and at the bottom found a very large vault in the
&s;hape of an hor&s;e-&s;hoe. The floors con&s;i&s;ted of a kind of white
&s;tone enamelled with lead ore, and the pendent rocks were glazed with &s;par.
Walking forward on this &s;tony pavement, for &s;ome time, he came to a great
river, twenty fathoms broad, and eight fathoms deep; and having been informed
that it ebbed and flowed with the &s;ea, he remained in this gloomy abode for
five hours, to make an exact ob&s;ervation. He did not find, however, any
alteration what&s;oever in its appearance. But his curio&s;ity was ill
requited; for it co&s;t this unfortunate gentleman his life: immediately 
<PB N="67" REF="85"> after his return, he was &s;eized with an unu&s;ual and
violent head-ach, which threw him into a fever, of which he died &s;oon
after.</P>
<P>But of all the &s;ubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of
Antiparos is the mo&s;t re|markable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty
of its &s;parry incru&s;tations. This celebrated ca|vern was fir&s;t
di&s;covered by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about an hundred years ago, at
Antiparos, an incon&s;iderable i&s;land of the Ar|chipelago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. &s;ub. 122.</BIBL> I have tran&s;lated a part
of Kircher's de&s;cription, rather than Tournefort's, as the latter was written
to &s;upport an hypothe&s;is.</NOTE>. The account he gives of it is long and
inflated, but upon the whole amu&s;ing. 
<Q REND="inline">"Having been informed," &s;ays he, "by the na|tives
of Paros, that in the little i&s;land of Antipa|ros, which lies about two miles
from the former, of a gigantic &s;tatue that was to be &s;een at the mouth of a
cavern in that place, it was re&s;olved that we (the French con&s;ul and
him&s;elf) &s;hould pay it a vi&s;it. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution,
af|ter we had landed on the i&s;land, and walked about four, miles thro' the
mid&s;t of beautiful plains, and &s;loping woodlands, we at length came to a
little hill, on the &s;ide of which yawned a mo&s;t horrid cavern, that with
its gloom at fir&s;t &s;truck us with terror, and almo&s;t repre&s;t
curio&s;ity. Recovering <PB N="68" REF="86"> the fir&s;t &s;urprize, however,
we entered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;tatue of the giant pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view. We quickly
perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was
nothing more than a &s;parry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure that their fears had
formed into a mon&s;ter. Incited by this extraordinary ap|pearance, we were
induced to proceed &s;till far|ther, in que&s;t of new adventures in this
&s;ub|terranean abode. As we proceeded, new won|ders offered them&s;elves; the
&s;pars, formed into trees and &s;hrubs, pre&s;ented a kind of petrified grove;
&s;ome white, &s;ome green; and all re|ceding in due per&s;pective. They
&s;truck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of
Nature, who, hither|to in &s;olitude, had, in her playful moments, dre&s;&s;ed
the &s;cene, as if for her own amu&s;e|ment. 
<P>"But we had as yet &s;een but a few of the won|ders of the
place; and we were introduced as yet only into the portico of this amazing
tem|ple. In one corner of this half illuminated re|ce&s;s, there appeared an
opening of about three feet wide, which &s;eemed to lead to a place to|tally 
<PB N="69" REF="87"> dark, and that one of the natives a&s;&s;ured us contained
nothing more than a re&s;ervoir of water. Upon this we tried, by throwing down
&s;ome &s;tones, which rumbling along the &s;ides of the de&s;cent for &s;ome
time, the &s;ound &s;eemed at la&s;t qua&s;hed in a bed of water. In order,
how|ever, to be more certain, we &s;ent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the
promi&s;e of a good re|ward, with a flambeaux in his hand, ventured into this
narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he
re|turned, carrying &s;ome beautiful pieces of white &s;par in his hand, which
art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place
was full of the&s;e beautiful incru&s;tations, I ventured in once more with
him, for about fifty paces, anxiou&s;ly and cautiou&s;ly de&s;cending by a
&s;teep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which
led into a &s;pacious amphitheatre, if I may &s;o call it, &s;till deeper than
any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeaux, and
other things to expedite our de&s;cent, our whole company, man by man, ventured
into the &s;ame opening, and de&s;cending one after another, we at la&s;t &s;aw
our&s;elves all together in the mo&s;t magnificent part of the cavern.</P> 
<P><PB N="70" REF="88">"Our candles being now all lighted up, and
the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be pre&s;ented with
a more glitter|ing, or a more magnificent &s;cene. The roof all hung with
&s;olid i&s;icles, tran&s;parent as gla&s;s, yet &s;olid as marble. The eye
could &s;carce reach the lofty and noble cieling; the &s;ides were re|gularly
formed with &s;pars; and the whole pre|&s;ented the idea of a magnificent
theatre, illu|minated with an immen&s;e profu&s;ion of lights. The floor
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;olid marble; and in &s;e|veral places, magnificent columns,
thrones, altars, and other objects appeared, as if nature had de&s;igned to
mock the curio&s;ities of art. Our voices, upon &s;peaking or &s;inging, were
re|doubled to an a&s;toni&s;hing loudne&s;s; and upon the firing of a gun, the
noi&s;e and reverberations were almo&s;t deafening. In the mid&s;t of this
grand amphitheatre ro&s;e a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, re|&s;embled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we
cau&s;ed ma&s;s to be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that &s;hot up
round the altar, appeared like candle&s;ticks; and many other na|tural objects
repre&s;ented the cu&s;tomary orna|ments of this &s;acrament.</P> 
<P>"Below even this &s;pacious grotto, there &s;eem|ed another
cavern; down which I ventured with <PB N="71" REF="89"> my former mariner, and
de&s;cended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at la&s;t arrived at a
&s;mall &s;pot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that
of the amphithe|atre, being compo&s;ed of &s;oft clay, yielding to the
pre&s;&s;ure, and in which I thru&s;t a &s;tick to about &s;ix feet deep. In
this, however, as above, numbers of the mo&s;t beautiful chry&s;|tals were
formed; one of which, particularly, re&s;embled a table. Upon our egre&s;s from
this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek in&s;crip|tion upon a rock at the
mouth, but &s;o oblite|rated by time, that we could not read it. It &s;eemed to
import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come thither; but
whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to
inform us."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the account of this beautiful &s;cene, as communicated in a
letter to Kircher. We have another, and a more copious de&s;cription of it by
Tournefort, which is in every body's hands; but I have given the above, both
be|cau&s;e it was communicated by the fir&s;t di&s;co|verer, and becau&s;e it
is a &s;imple narrative of facts, without any rea&s;oning upon them. Accord|ing
to Tournefort's account, indeed, we might conclude, from the rapid growth of
the &s;pars in this grotto, that it mu&s;t every year be growing 
<PB N="72" REF="90"> narrower, and that it mu&s;t, in time, be choaked up with
them entirely; but no &s;uch thing has happened hitherto, and the grotto at
this day continues as &s;pacious as we ever knew it.</P>
<P>This is not the place for an enquiry into the &s;eeming vegetation
of tho&s;e &s;tony &s;ub&s;tances with which this and almo&s;t every cavern are
incru&s;ted. It is enough to ob&s;erve, in general, that they are formed by an
accumulation of that little gritty matter which is carried thither by the
waters, and which in time acquires the hard|ne&s;s of marble. What in this
place more imports us to know is, how the&s;e amazing hollows in the earth came
to be formed. And I think, in the three in&s;tances above-mentioned, it is
pretty evident, that their excavation has been owing to waters. The&s;e finding
&s;ubterraneous pa&s;|&s;ages under the earth, and by long degrees hollowing
the beds in which they flowed, the ground above them has &s;lipt down clo&s;er
to their &s;urface, leaving the upper layers of the earth or &s;tone &s;till
&s;u&s;pended. The ground that &s;inks upon the face of the waters forming the
floor of the cavern; the ground, or rock that keeps &s;u&s;pended, forming the
roof: and, indeed, there are but few of the&s;e caverns found without water,
either within them, or near enough to point out their formation.</P>

<P>THE caverns, which we have been de&s;crib|ing, generally carry us
but a very little way below the &s;urface of the earth. Two hundred feet, at
the utmo&s;t, is as much as the lowe&s;t of them is found to &s;ink. The
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures run much deeper; but few per&s;ons have been bold
enough to venture down to their deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es: and &s;ome few who have
tried, have been able to bring back no tidings of the place, for unfortunately
they left their lives below. The excavations of art have con|duced us much
further into the bowels of the globe. Some mines in Hungary are known to be a
thou&s;and yards perpendicularly down|wards; and I have been informed, by good

that as we de&s;cend into the <PB N="74" REF="92"> mines, the various layers of
earth are &s;een, as we have already de&s;cribed them; and in &s;ome of the&s;e
are always found the metals or minerals, for which the mine has been dug. Thus
frequently gold is found di&s;per&s;ed and mixed with clay and gravel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. ii. p. 470.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;ometimes it
is mingled with other metallic bodies, &s;tones, or bitumens; and<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa. ibid.</BIBL></NOTE> &s;ometimes united
with that mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of all &s;ub&s;tances, platina, from which
&s;carce any art can &s;eparate it. Silver is &s;ometimes found quite pure<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Macquer's Chymi&s;try, vol. i. p.

Copper is found in beds mixed with various &s;ub&s;tances, marbles, &s;ulphurs,
and pyrites. Tin, the ore of which is heavier than that of any other metal, is
generally found mixed with every kind of matter: 
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's Fo&s;&s;ils, p.

extracted from all the &s;ub&s;tances upon earth.</P>
<P>The variety of &s;ub&s;tances which are thus found in the bowels of
the earth, in their na|tive &s;tate, have a very different appearance from what
they are afterwards taught to a&s;&s;ume by human induftry. The riche&s;t

<P>This variety of &s;ub&s;tances, which compo&s;e the internal parts
of our globe, is productive of equal varieties, both above and below its
&s;ur|face. The combination of the different mi|nerals with each other, the
heats which ari&s;e from their mixture, the vapours they diffu&s;e, the fires
which they generate, or the colds which they &s;ometimes produce, are all
either noxious or &s;alutary to man; &s;o that in this great elabra|tory of

<P>This difference in the air was &s;uppo&s;ed by Boyle to proceed from

Be&s;ide this, as the external air cannot readily reach the bottom, or be
renewed there, an ob|&s;ervable heat is perceived below, without the
nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to the central heat for an explanation.</P>
<P>Hence, therefore, there are two principal cau&s;es of the warmth at
the bottom of mine: the heat of the &s;ub&s;tances of which the &s;ides are
compo&s;ed; and the want of renovation in the air below. Any &s;ulphureous
&s;ub&s;tance mixed with iron, produces a very great heat, by the admi&s;&s;ion
of water. If, for in&s;tance, a quantity of &s;ulphur be mixed with a
proportionable &s;hare of iron filings, and both kneaded together into a &s;oft
pa&s;te, with water, they will &s;oon grow hot, and at la&s;t produce a flame.
This experiment, produced by art, is very commonly effected within the bowels
of the earth by nature. Sul|phurs and irons are intimately blended together,
and want only the mixture of water of air to excite their heat; and this, when
once rai&s;ed, is communicated to all bodies that lie within the &s;phere of
their operation. Tho&s;e beautiful <PB N="77" REF="95"> minerals, called
marca&s;ites and pyrites, are often of this compo&s;ition; and wherever they
are found, either by imbibing the moi&s;ture of the air, or having been by any
means combined with water, they render the mine con&s;iderably hot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 216.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The want of fre&s;h air, al&s;o, at the&s;e depths, is, as we have
&s;aid, another rea&s;on for their being found much hotter. Indeed, without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, the bottom of mo&s;t mines would, from this cau&s;e,
be in&s;upportable. To re|medy this inconvenience, the miners are often obliged
to &s;ink, at &s;ome convenient di&s;tance from the mouth of the pit where they
are at work, another pit, which joins the former be|low, and which, in
Derby&s;hire, is called an air|&s;haft. Through this the air circulates; and
thus the workmen are enabled to breathe freely at the bottom of the place;
which becomes, as Mr. Boyle affirms, very commodious for re&s;|piration; and
al&s;o very temperate as to heat and cold<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p. 238.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr. Locke, however,
who has left us an account of the Mendip mines, &s;eems to pre|&s;ent a
different picture. 
<Q REND="inline">"The de&s;cent into the&s;e is exceeding difficult
and dangerous; for they are not &s;unk like wells, perpendicularly, 
<PB N="78" REF="96"> but as the crannies of the rocks happen to run. The
con&s;tant method is to &s;wing down by a rope, placed under the arms, and
clamber along, by applying both feet and hands to the &s;ides of the narrow
pa&s;&s;age. The air is conveyed into them through a little pa&s;&s;age that
runs along the &s;ides from the top, where they &s;et up &s;ome turfs, on the
lee-&s;ide of the hole, to catch and force it down. The&s;e turfs being removed
to the windy &s;ide, or laid over the mouth of the hole, the miners below
pre&s;ently want breath, and faint; and if &s;weet &s;melling flowers chance to
be placed there, they immediately lo&s;e their fragrancy, and &s;tink like
carrion."</Q> An air &s;o very pu|trifying can never be very commodious for
re&s;|piration.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine the complexion of mo&s;t miners, we &s;hall be
very well able to form a judg|ment of the unwhol&s;omne&s;s of the place where
they are confined. Their pale and &s;allow looks &s;hew how much the air is
damaged by pa&s;&s;ing through tho&s;e deep and winding ways, that are rendered
humid by damps, or warmed with nox|ious exhalations. But although every mine is
unwhol&s;ome, all are not equally &s;o. Coal-mines are generally le&s;s noxious
than tho&s;e of tin; tin than tho&s;e of copper; but of all, none are &s;o
dreadfully de&s;tructive as tho&s;e of quick&s;ilver. <PB N="79" REF="97"> At
the mines near the village of Idra, nothing can adequately de&s;cribe the
deplorable infir|mities of &s;uch as fill the ho&s;pital there: ema|ciated and
crippled, every limb contracted or convul&s;ed, and &s;ome in a manner
tran&s;piring quick&s;ilver at every pore. There was one man, &s;ays Dr.
Pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.
578.</BIBL></NOTE>, who was not in the mines above half a year, and yet who&s;e
body was &s;o im|pregnated with this mineral, that putting a piece of bra&s;s
money in his mouth, or rubbing it between his fingers, it immediately became as
white as if it had been wa&s;hed over with quick|&s;ilver. In this manner all
the workmen are killed, &s;ooner or later; fir&s;t becoming paralytic, and then
dying con&s;umptive: and all this they &s;u&s;tain for the trifling reward of
&s;even-pence a day.</P>
<P>But the&s;e metalic mines are not &s;o noxious from their own
vapours, as from tho&s;e of the &s;ub&s;tances with which the ores are
u&s;ually united, &s;uch as ar&s;enic, cinnabar, bitumen, or vitriol. From the
fumes of the&s;e, variou&s;ly combined, and kept enclo&s;ed, are produced
tho&s;e various damps that put on &s;o many dread|ful forms, and are u&s;ually
&s;o fatal. Sometimes tho&s;e noxious vapours are perceived by the de|lightful
fragrance of their &s;mell<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p.
375.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling the pea-blo&s;&s;om in bloom, from
whence <PB N="80" REF="98"> one kind of damp has its name. The miners are not
deceived, however, by its flattering appear|ances; but as they thus have timely
notice of its coming, they avoid it while it continues, which is generally
during the whole &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. Another &s;hews its approach by the
burning of the candles, which &s;eem to collect their flame into a globe of
light, and thus gradually le&s;&s;en, till they are quite extingui&s;hed. From
this al&s;o, the miners frequently e&s;cape; however, &s;uch as have the
misfortune to be caught in it, either &s;woon away, and are &s;uffocated, or
&s;lowly recover in exce&s;&s;ive agonies. Here is al&s;o a third, called the
fulminating damp, much more dangerous than either of the former, as it
&s;trikes down all be|fore it, like a fla&s;h of gunpowder, without giving any
warning of its approach. But there is &s;till another, more deadly than all the
re&s;t, which is found in tho&s;e places where the vapour has been long
confined, and has been, by &s;ome acci|dent, &s;et free. The air ru&s;hing out
from thence, always goes upon deadly errands; and &s;carce any e&s;cape to
de&s;cribe the &s;ymptoms of its ope|rations.</P>
<P>Some colliers in Scotland, working near an old mine that had been
long clo&s;ed up, hap|pened inadvertently to open an hole into it, from the pit
where they were then employed. <PB N="81" REF="99"> By great good fortune, they
at that time per|ceived their error, and in&s;tantly fled for their lives. The
next day, however, they were re|&s;olved to renew their work in the &s;ame pit,
and eight of them ventured down, without any great apprehen&s;ions; but they
had &s;carce got to the bottom of the &s;tairs that led to the pit, but coming
within the vapour, they all in&s;tantly dropped down dead, as if they had been
&s;hot. Among&s;t the&s;e unfortunate poor men, there was one who&s;e wife was
informed that he was &s;tifled in the mine; and as he happened to be next the
entrance, &s;he &s;o far ventured down as to &s;ee where he lay. As &s;he
approached the place, the &s;ight of her hu&s;band in&s;pired her with a
de|&s;ire to re&s;cue him, if po&s;&s;ible, from that dreadful &s;ituation;
though a little reflection might have &s;hewn her it was then too late. But
nothing could deter her; &s;he ventured forward, and had &s;carce touched him
with her hand, when the damp prevailed, and the mi&s;guided, but faith|ful
creature, fell dead by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Thus, the vapours found beneath the &s;urface of the earth, are very
various in their effects upon the con&s;titution: and they are not le&s;s in
their appearances. There are many kinds that &s;eemingly are no way prejudicial
to health, but in which the workmen breathe freely; and yet 
<PB N="82" REF="100"> in the&s;e, if a lighted candle be introduced, they
immediately take fire, and the whole cavern at once becomes one furnace of
flame. In mines, therefore, &s;ubject to damps of this kind, they are obliged
to have recour&s;e to a very pe|culiar contrivance to &s;upply &s;ufficient
light for their operations. This is by a great wheel; the circumference of
which is be&s;et with flints, which &s;triking again&s;t &s;teels placed for
that pur|po&s;e at the extremity, a &s;tream of fire is pro|duced, which
affords light enough; and yet which does not &s;et fire to the mineral
vapour.</P>
<P>Of this kind are the vapours of the mines about Bri&s;tol: on the
contrary, in other mines, a &s;ingle &s;park &s;truck out from the colli&s;ion
of flint and &s;teel, would &s;et the whole &s;haft in a flame. In &s;uch,
therefore, every precaution is u&s;ed to avoid a colli&s;ion ; the workmen
making u&s;e only of wooden in&s;truments in digging; and being cautious before
they enter the mine, to take out even the nails from their &s;hoes. Whence this
&s;trange difference &s;hould ari&s;e, that the vapours of &s;ome mines catch
fire with a &s;park, and others only with a flame, is a que&s;tion that we
mu&s;t be content to leave in ob&s;curity, till we know more of the nature both
of mineral vapour and of fire, This only we may ob&s;erve, that gunpowder will
readily fire <PB N="83" REF="101"> with a &s;park, but not with the flame of a
can|dle: on the other hand, &s;pirits of wine will flame with a candle, but not
with a &s;park; but even here the cau&s;e of this difference, as yet, remains a
&s;ecret.</P>
<P>As from this account of mines, it appears that the internal parts of
the globe are filled with vapours of various kinds, it is not &s;upriz|ing,
that they &s;hould at different times reach the &s;urface, and there put on
various appear|ances. In fact, much of the &s;alubrity, and much of the
unwhol&s;omene&s;s of climates and &s;oils, is to be a&s;cribed to the&s;e
vapours, which make their way from the bowels of the earth upwards, and
refre&s;h or taint the air with their exhalations. Salt mines being naturally
cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.
523.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;end forth a degree of coldne&s;s to the external air, to
comfort and refre&s;h it: on the con|trary, metallic mines are known, not only
to warm it with their exhalations, but often to de&s;troy all kinds of
vegetation by their volatile corro&s;ive fumes. In &s;ome mines den&s;e vapours
are plainly perceived i&s;&s;uing from their mouths, and &s;en&s;ibly warm to
the touch. In &s;ome places, neither &s;now nor ice will continue on the ground
that covers a mine; and over others <PB N="82" REF="102">

this cla&s;s of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e vapours which thus e&s;cape to the &s;urface of the
earth, entirely unconfined; for they are frequently, in a manner,
circum&s;cribed to a &s;pot: the grotto Del Cane, near Naples, is an in&s;tance
of this; the noxious effects of which have made that cavern &s;o very famous.
This grotto, which has &s;o much employed the attention of travellers, lies
within four miles of Naples, and is &s;ituated near a large lake of clear and
whole&s;ome water<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol.
i. p. 191.</BIBL></NOTE>. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the land&s;cape
which this lake affords; being &s;urrounded with hills covered with fore&s;ts
of the mo&s;t beautiful ver|dure, and the whole bearing a kind of
amphi|theatrical appearance. However, this region, beautiful as it appears, is
almo&s;t entirely un|inhabited; the few pea&s;ants that nece&s;&s;ity com|pels
to re&s;ide there, looking quite con&s;ump|tive and gha&s;tly, from the
poi&s;onous exhala|tions <PB N="85" REF="105"> that ri&s;e from the earth. The
famous grotto lies on the &s;ide of an hill, near which place a pea&s;ant
re&s;ides, who keeps a number of dogs for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing the
expe|riment to the curious. The&s;e poor animals always &s;eem perfectly
&s;en&s;ible of the approach of a &s;tranger, and endeavour to get out of the
way. However, their attempts being perceived, they are taken and brought to the
grotto; the noxious effects of which they have &s;o fre|quently experienced.
Upon entering this place, which is a little cave, or hole rather, dug into the
hill, about eight feet high and twelve feet long, the ob&s;erver can &s;ee no
vi&s;i|ble marks of its pe&s;tilential vapour; only to about a foot from the
bottom, the wall &s;eems to be tinged with a colour re&s;embling that which is
given by &s;tagnant waters. When the dog, this poor philo&s;ophical martyr, as
&s;ome have called him, is held above this mark, he does not &s;eem to feel the
&s;malle&s;t inconveni|ence; but when his head is thru&s;t down lower, he
&s;truggles to get free for a little; but in the &s;pace of four or five
minutes he &s;eems to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;ation, and is taken out &s;eemingly
with|out life. Being plunged in the neighbour|ing lake, he quickly recovers,
and is permitted <PB N="86" REF="106"> to run home &s;eemingly without the
&s;malle&s;t injury.</P>
<P>This vapour, which thus for a time &s;uffo|cates, is of the humid
kind, as it extingui&s;hes a torch, and &s;ullies a looking-gla&s;s; but there
are other vapours perfectly inflamable, and that only require the approach of a
candle to &s;et them blazing. Of this kind was the burning well at Bro&s;ely,
which is now &s;topped up; the vapour of which, when a candle was brought
within about a foot of the &s;urface of the water, caught flame like &s;pirits
of wine, and con|tinued blazing for &s;everal hours after. Of this kind,
al&s;o, are the perpetual fires in the kingdom of Per&s;ia. In that province,
where the wor&s;hippers of fire hold their chief my&s;teries, the whole
&s;urface of the earth, for &s;ome extent, &s;eems impregnated with inflam|able
vapours. A reed &s;tuck into the ground continues to burn like a flambeaux; an
hole made beneath the &s;urface of the earth, in&s;tantly becomes a furnace
an&s;wering all the purpo&s;es of a culinary fire. There they make lime by
merely burying the &s;tones in the earth, and watch with veneration the
appearances of a flame that has not been extingui&s;hed for times immemorial.
How different are men in various <PB N="87" REF="108"> climates! This deluded

&s;ize, are di&s;|charged to many miles di&s;tance; &s;o that the force of the
mo&s;t powerful artillery, is but as a breeze agitating a feather in
compari&s;on. In the deluge of fire and melted matter which runs down the
&s;ides of the mountain, whole cities are &s;ometimes &s;wallowed up and
con|&s;umed. Tho&s;e rivers of liquid fire are &s;ome|times two hundred feet
deep; and, when they harden, frequently form con&s;iderable hills. Nor is the
danger of the&s;e confined to the eruption only: but the force of the internal
fire &s;trug|gling for vent, frequently produces earth|quakes through the whole
region where the volcano is &s;ituated. So dreadful have been the&s;e
appearances, that men's terrors have added new horrors to the &s;cene, and they
have regard|ed as prodigies, what we know to be the re&s;ult of natural
cau&s;es. Some philo&s;ophers have con|&s;idered them as vents communicating
with the fires of the center, and the ignorant as the mouths of hell it&s;elf.
A&s;toni&s;hment produces fear, and fear &s;uper&s;tition: the inhabitants of
Iceland believe the bellowings of Hecla are nothing el&s;e but the cries of the
damned, and that its eruptions are contrived to encrea&s;e their tortures.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="112">But if we regard this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene
of terror with a more tranquil and inqui&s;itive eye, we &s;hall find that
the&s;e conflagrations are pro|duced by very obvious and natural cau&s;es. We
have already been apprized of the various mineral &s;ub&s;tances in the bo&s;om
of the earth, and their aptne&s;s to bur&s;t out into flames. Marca&s;ites and
pyrites, in particular, by being humefied with water, or air, contract this
heat, and often endeavour to expand with ir|re&s;i&s;tible explo&s;ion.
The&s;e, therefore, being lodged in the depths of the earth, or in the bo&s;om
of mountains, and being either wa&s;hed by the accidental influx of waters
below, or fanned by air, in&s;inuating it&s;elf through per|pendicular
fi&s;&s;ures from above, take fire at fir&s;t by only heaving in earthquakes,
but at length by bur&s;ting through every ob&s;tacle, and making their dreadful
di&s;charge in a volcano.</P>
<P>The&s;e volcanoes are found in all parts of the earth: in Europe
there are three that are very remarkable; Aetna in Sicily, Ve&s;uvius in Italy,
and Hecla in Iceland. Aetna has been a volcano for ages immemorial. Its
eruptions are very violent, and its di&s;charge has been known to cover the
earth &s;ixty-eight feet deep. In the year 1537, an eruption of this mountain
pro|duced an earthquake through the whole i&s;land, <PB N="90" REF="113"> for
twelve days, overturned many hou&s;es, and at la&s;t formed a new aperture
which over|whelmed all within five leagues round. The cinders thrown up were
driven even into Italy, and its burnings were &s;een at Malta at the di&s;tance
of &s;ixty leagues. There is nothing more awful, &s;ays Kircher, than the
eruptions of this mountain, nor nothing more dangerous than attempting to
examine its appearances, even long after the eruption has cea&s;ed. As we
at|tempt to clamber up its &s;teepy &s;ides, every &s;tep we take upward, the
feet &s;ink back half way. Upon arriving near the &s;ummit, a&s;hes and &s;now,
with an ill a&s;&s;orted conjunction, pre&s;ent nothing but objects of
de&s;olation. Nor is this the wor&s;t, for, as all places are covered over,
many ca|verns are entirely hidden from the &s;ight, into which, if the enquirer
happens to fall, he &s;inks to the bottom, and meets inevitable de&s;truction.
Upon coming to the edge of the great crater, nothing can &s;ufficiently
repre&s;ent the tremen|dous magnificence of the &s;cene. A gulph two miles
over, and &s;o deep that no bottom can be &s;een; on the &s;ides pyramidical
rocks &s;tarting out between apertures that emit &s;moke and flame; all this
accompanied with a &s;ound that never cea&s;es, louder than thunder, &s;trikes
the bold with horror, and the religious with vene|ration <PB N="91" REF="114">
for him that has power to controle its burnings.</P>
<P>In the de&s;criptions of Ve&s;uvius, or Hecla, we &s;hall find
&s;carce any thing but a repetition of the &s;ame terrible objects, but rather
le&s;&s;ened, as the&s;e mountains are not &s;o large as the former. The crater
of Ve&s;uvius is but a mile acro&s;s, according to the &s;ame author; whereas
that of Aetna is two. On this particular, how|ever, we mu&s;t place no
dependance, as the&s;e caverns every day alter; being le&s;&s;ened by the
mountains &s;inking in at one eruption, and enlarged by the fury of another. It
is not one of the lea&s;t remarkable particulars re&s;pect|ing Ve&s;uvius, that
Pliny the naturali&s;t was &s;uf|focated in one of its eruptions; for his
cu|rio&s;ity impelling him too near, he found him|&s;elf involved in &s;moke
and cinders when it was too late to retire; and his companions hardly e&s;caped
to give an account of the misfor|tune. It was in that dreadful eruption that
the city of Herculaneum was overwhelmed; the ruins of which have been lately
di&s;covered at &s;ixty feet di&s;tance below the &s;urface, and, what is
&s;till more remarkable, forty feet below the bed of the &s;ea. One of the
mo&s;t remarkable erup|tions of this mountain was in the year 1707, which is
finely de&s;cribed by Valetta, a part of <PB N="92" REF="115"> who&s;e
de&s;cription I &s;hall beg leave to tran&s;|late.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Towards the latter end of &s;ummer, in the year
1707, the mount Ve&s;uvius, that had for a long time been &s;ilent, now began
to give &s;ome &s;igns of commotion. Little more than inter|nal murmurs at
fir&s;t were heard, that &s;eemed to contend within the lowe&s;t depths of the
mountain; no flame, nor even any &s;moak was as yet &s;een. Soon after &s;ome
&s;moak appeared by day, and a flame by night, which &s;eemed to brighten all
the campania. At intervals al&s;o it &s;hot off &s;ub&s;tances with a &s;ound
very like that of artillery, but which, even at &s;o great a di&s;|tance as we
were at, infinitely exceeded them in greatne&s;s. Soon after it began to throw
up a&s;hes, which becoming the &s;port of the winds, fell at great di&s;tances,
and &s;ome many miles. To this &s;ucceeded &s;howers of &s;tones, which killed
many of the inhabitants of the valley, but made a dreadful ravage among the
cattle. Soon after a torrent of burning matter began to roll down the &s;ides
of the mountain, at fir&s;t with a &s;low and gentle motion, but &s;oon with
encrea&s;ed celerity. The matter thus poured out, when cold, &s;eemed, upon
in&s;pection, to be of vitrified earth, the whole united into a ma&s;s of more
than &s;tony hardne&s;s. But what <PB N="93" REF="116"> was particularly
ob&s;ervable was, that upon the whole &s;urface of the&s;e melted materials, a
light &s;pongy &s;tone &s;eemed to float, while the lower body was of the
harde&s;t &s;ub&s;tance, of which our roads are u&s;ually made. Hitherto there
were no appearances but what had been often re|marked before; but on the third
or fourth day, &s;eeming fla&s;hes of lightening were &s;hot forth from the
mouth of the mountain, with a noi&s;e far exceeding the loude&s;t thunder.
The&s;e fla&s;hes, in colour and brightne&s;s, re&s;embled what we u&s;ually
&s;ee in tempe&s;ts, but they a&s;&s;umed a more twi&s;ted and &s;erpentine
form. After this followed &s;uch clouds of &s;moak and a&s;hes, that the whole
city of Naples, in the mid&s;t of the day, was involved in nocturnal
darkne&s;s, and the neare&s;t friends were unable to di&s;tingui&s;h each other
in this frightful gloom. If any per|&s;on attempted to &s;tir out without
torch-light he was obliged to return, and every part of the city was filled
with &s;upplications and terror; at length, after a continuance of &s;ome
hours, about one o'clock at midnight, the wind blow|ing from the north, the
&s;tars began to be &s;een; the heavens, though it was night, began to grow
brighter; and the eruptions, after a con|tinuance of fifteen days, to
le&s;&s;en. The tor|rent of melted matter was &s;een to extend from 
<PB N="94" REF="117"> the mountain down to the &s;hore; the people began to
return to their former dwellings, and the whole face of nature to re&s;ume its
former appearance."</Q></P>

eruptions in a manner &s;ome|thing different from the former. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol.
ii. p. 209.</BIBL></NOTE>"In the year 1717, and the middle of April, with much
difficulty I reached the top of mount Ve&s;uvius, in which I &s;aw a va&s;t
apperture full of &s;moak, which hindered me from &s;eeing its depth and
figure. I heard within that horrid gulph cer|tain extraordinary &s;ounds, which
&s;eemed to proceed from the bowels of the mountain, a &s;ort of murmuring,
&s;ighing, da&s;hing &s;ound, and between whiles a noi&s;e like that of thunder
or cannon, with a clattering like that of tiles falling from the tops of
hou&s;es into the &s;treets. Sometimes, as the wind changed, the &s;moak grew
thinner, di&s;covering a very ruddy flame, and the circumference of the crater
&s;treaked with red and &s;everal &s;hades of yellow. After an hour's &s;tay,
the &s;moak being moved by the wind, gave us &s;hort and partial pro&s;pects of
the great hollow; in the flat bottom of which I could di&s;cern two furnaces
almo&s;t contigu|ous; that on the left &s;eeming about three yards 
<PB N="95" REF="118"> over, glowing with ruddy flame, and throwing up red hot
&s;tones, with an hideous noi&s;e, which, as they fell back, cau&s;ed the
clattering already taken notice of. May 8, in the morning, I a&s;cended the top
of Ve&s;uvius a &s;econd time, and found a different face of things. The
&s;moak a&s;cending upright, gave a full pro&s;pect of the crater, which, as I
could judge, was about a mile in circumference, and an hundred yards deep. A
conical mount had been formed &s;ince my la&s;t vi&s;it in the middle of the
bottom, which I could &s;ee was made by the &s;tones, thrown up and fallen back
again into the cra|ter. In this new hill remained the two furnaces already
mentioned. The one was &s;een to throw up every three or four minutes, with a
dread|ful &s;ound, a va&s;t number of red hot &s;tones, at lea&s;t three
hundred feet higher than my head, as I &s;tood upon the brink; but as there was
no wind, they fell perpendicularly back from whence they had been di&s;charged.
The other was filled with red hot liquid matter, like that in the furnace of a
gla&s;s-hou&s;e; raging and working like the waves of the &s;ea, with a &s;hort
abrupt noi&s;e. This matter would &s;ometimes boil over, and run down the
&s;ide of the conical hill, appearing at fir&s;t red hot, but changing colour
as it hardened and cooled. Had the <PB N="96" REF="119"> wind driven in our
faces, we had been in no &s;mall danger of &s;tifling by the &s;ulphureous
&s;moak, or being killed by the ma&s;&s;es of melted minerals, that were &s;hot
from the bottom. But as the wind was favourable, I had an oppor|tunity of
&s;urveying this amazing &s;cene for above an hour and an half together. On the
fifth of June, after an horrid noi&s;e, the mountain was &s;een at Naples to
work over; and about three days after, its thunders were renewed &s;o, that not
only the windows in the city, but all the hou&s;es &s;hook. From that time it
continued to overflow, and &s;ometimes at night were &s;een co|lumns of fire
&s;hooting upward from its &s;ummit. On the tenth, when all was thought to be
over, the mountain again renewed its terrors, roaring and raging mo&s;t
violently. One cannot form a ju&s;ter idea of the noi&s;e, in the mo&s;t
violent fits of it, than by imagining a mixed &s;ound, made up of the raging of
a tempe&s;t, the mur|mur of a troubled &s;ea, and the roaring of thun|der and
arillery, confu&s;ed all together. Though we heard this at the di&s;tance of
twelve miles, yet it was very terrible. I therefore re&s;olved to approach
nearer to the mountain; and, accord|ingly, three or four of us got into a boat,
and were &s;et a&s;hore at a little town, &s;ituated at the foot of the
mountain. From thence we rode <PB N="97" REF="120"> about four or five miles,
before we came to the torrent of fire that was de&s;cending from the &s;ide of
the volcano; and here the roaring grew ex|ceeding loud and terrible as we
approached. I ob&s;erved a mixture of colours in the cloud, above the crater,
green, yellow, red, blue. There was likewi&s;e a ruddy di&s;mal light in the
air, over that tract where the burning river flowed. The&s;e circum&s;tances,
&s;et off and aug|mented by the horror of the night; made a &s;cene the mo&s;t
uncommon and a&s;toni&s;hing I ever &s;aw; which &s;till encrea&s;ed as we
approached the burning river. Imagine a va&s;t torrent of liquid fire, rolling
from the top, down the &s;ide of the mountain, and with irre&s;i&s;tible fury
bearing down and con&s;uming vines, olives, and hou&s;es; and divided into
different channels, according to the inequalities of the mountain. The
large&s;t &s;tream &s;eemed half a mile broad at lea&s;t, and five miles long.
I walked &s;o far before my companions up the mountain, along the &s;ide of the
river of fire, that I was obliged to retire in great ha&s;te, the &s;ulphureous
&s;team having &s;ur|prized me, and almo&s;t taken away my breath. During our
return, which was about three o'clock in the morning, the roaring of the
mountain was heard all the way, while we ob|&s;erved it throwing up huge
&s;pouts of fire and <PB N="98" REF="121"> burning &s;tones, which falling,
re&s;embled the &s;tars in a rocket. Sometimes I ob&s;erved two or three
di&s;tinct columns of flame, and &s;ometimes one only that was large enough to
fill the whole crater. The&s;e burning columns, and fiery &s;tones, &s;eemed to
be &s;hot a thou&s;and feet per|pendicular above the &s;ummit of the volcano:
and in this manner the mountain continued raging for &s;ix or eight days after.
On the eighteenth of the &s;ame month the whole appear|ance ended, and the
mountain remained per|fectly quiet, without any vi&s;ible &s;moke or
flame."</Q></P>
<P>The matter which is found to roll down from the mouth of all
volcanoes in general, re|&s;embles the dro&s;s that is thrown from a &s;mith's
forge. But it is different, perhaps, in various parts of the globe; for, as we
have already &s;aid, there is not a quarter of the world that has not its
volcanoes. In A&s;ia, particularly in the i&s;lands of the Indian ocean, there
are many. One of the mo&s;t famous is that of Albouras, near Mount Taurus, the
&s;ummit of which is continually on fire, and covers the whole ad|jacent
country with a&s;hes. In the i&s;land of Ternate there is a volcano, which
&s;ome tra|vellers a&s;&s;ert, burns mo&s;t furiou&s;ly in the times of the
equinoxes, becau&s;e of the winds which <PB N="99" REF="122"> then contribute
to encrea&s;e the flames. In the Molucca i&s;lands there are many burning
moun|tains; they are al&s;o &s;een in Japan, and the i&s;lands adjacent; and in
Java and Sumatra, as well as in other of the Philippine i&s;lands. In Africa
there is a cavern, near Fez, which con|tinually &s;ends forth either &s;moke or
flames. In the Cape de Verde i&s;lands, one of them, called the I&s;land del
Fuogo, continually burns; and the Portugue&s;e, who frequently attempted a
&s;et|tlement there, have as often been obliged to de&s;i&s;t. The Peak of
Teneriffe is, as every body knows, a volcano that &s;eldom de&s;i&s;ts from
eruptions. But of all parts of the earth, Ame|rica is the place where tho&s;e
dreadful irregu|larities of nature are the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. Ve&s;uvius,
and Aetna it&s;elf, are but mere fire|works, in compari&s;on to the burning
moun|tains of the Andes; which, as they are the highe&s;t mountains of the
world, &s;o al&s;o are they the mo&s;t formidable for their eruptions. The
mountain of Arequipa in Peru, is one of the mo&s;t celebrated; Cara&s;&s;a, and
Malahallo, are very con&s;iderable; but that of Cotopaxi, in the province of
Quito, exceeds any thing we have hitherto read or heard of. The mountain of
Cotopaxi, as de&s;cribed by Ulloa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i.
p. 442.</BIBL></NOTE>, is more <PB N="100" REF="123"> than three miles
perpendicular from the &s;ea; and it became a volcano at the time of the
Spaniards fir&s;t arrival in that country. A new eruption of it happened in the
year 1743, hav|ing been &s;ome days preceded by a continual roaring in its
bowels. The &s;ound of one of the&s;e mountains is not like that of the
vol|canoes in Europe, confined to a province, but is heard at an hundred and
fifty miles di&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
442.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"An aperture was made in the &s;ummit of this
immen&s;e mountain; and three more about equal heights, near the middle of its
declivity, which was at that time buried under prodigious ma&s;&s;es of &s;now.
The ignited &s;ub&s;tances ejected on that occa&s;ion, mixed with a prodigious
quantity of ice and &s;now, melting amid&s;t the flames, were carried down with
&s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, that in an in&s;tant the valley from Callo to
Lata|cunga was overflowed; and be&s;ides its ravages in bearing down the
hou&s;es of the Indians, and other poor inhabitants, great numbers of people
lo&s;t their lives. The river of Latacunga was the channel of this terrible
flood; till being too &s;mall for receiving &s;uch a prodigious current, it
overflowed the adjacent country, like a va&s;t lake, near the town, and carried
away all the buildings within its reach. The inhabitants re|tired 
<PB N="101" REF="124"> into a &s;pot of higher ground behind the town, of which
tho&s;e parts which &s;tood within the limits of the current were totally
de&s;troyed. The dread of &s;till greater deva&s;tations did not &s;ub&s;ide
for three days; during which, the vol|cano ejected cinders, while torrents of
melte ice and &s;now poured down its &s;ides. The erup|tion la&s;ted &s;everal
days, and was accompanied with terrible roarings of the wind, ru&s;hing through
the volcano &s;till louder than the former rumblings in its bowels. At la&s;t
all was quiet, neither fire nor &s;moke to be &s;een, nor noi&s;e to be heard;
till in the en&s;uing year, the flames again appeared with recruited violence,
forcing their pa&s;&s;age through &s;everal other parts of the mountain, &s;o
that in clear nights the flames being reflected by the tran&s;parent ice,
formed an awfully magnificent illumination."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the appearance and the effect of tho&s;e fires which proceed
from the more inward re|ce&s;&s;es of the earth; for that they generally come
from deeper regions than man has hitherto ex|plored, I cannot avoid thinking,
contrary to the opinion of Mr. Buffon, who &s;uppo&s;es them rooted but a very
little way below the bed of the mountain. We can never &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays this
great naturali&s;t, that the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are ejected 
<PB N="102" REF="125"> from any great di&s;tance below, if we only con|&s;ider
the great force already required to fling them up to &s;uch va&s;t heights
above the mouth of the mountain; if we con&s;ider the &s;ub&s;tances thrown up,
which we &s;hall find upon in&s;pection to be the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the
mountain be|low; if we take into our con&s;ideration, that air is always
nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the flame; but, mo&s;t of all, if we attend to one
circum&s;tance, which is, that if the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances were exploded from a
va&s;t depth below, the &s;ame force required to &s;hoot them up &s;o high,
would act again&s;t the &s;ides of the volcano, and tear the whole moun|tain in
pieces. To all this &s;pecious rea&s;oning, particular an&s;wers might ea&s;ily
be given; as that the length of the funnel encrea&s;es the force of the
explo&s;ion; that the &s;ides of the funnel are actually often bur&s;t with the
great violence of the flame; that air may be &s;uppo&s;ed at depths at lea&s;t
as far as the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures de|&s;cend. But the be&s;t an&s;wer is
a well-known fact; namely, that the quantity of matter di&s;|charged from Aetna
alone, is &s;uppo&s;ed, upon a moderate computation, to exceed twenty times the
original bulk of the mountain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher, Mund.

what is &s;till more remarkable, the walls of the&s;e very hou&s;es have been
built of materials evidently thrown up by the mountain. The inference from all
this is very obvious; that the matter thus exploded cannot belong to the
mountain it&s;elf; otherwi&s;e, it would have been quickly con&s;umed; it
can|not be derived from moderate depths, &s;ince its amazing quantity evinces,
that all the places near the bottom mu&s;t have long &s;ince been ex|hau&s;ted;
nor can it have an exten&s;ive, and, if I may &s;o call it, a &s;uperficial

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given the theory of volcanoes, we have in &s;ome mea&s;ure
given al&s;o that of earthquakes. They both &s;eem to proceed from the &s;ame
cau&s;e, only with this difference, that the fury of the volcano is &s;pent in
the eruption, that of an earthquake &s;preads wider and acts more fatally by
being confined. The volcano only affrights a province, earthquakes have laid
whole kingdoms in ruin.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ari&s;totle,
Agricola, Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> have taken &s;ome pains to di|&s;tingui&s;h
between the various kinds of earth|quakes, &s;uch as the tremulous, the
pul&s;ative, the perpendicular, and the inclined; but the&s;e are rather the
di&s;tinctions of art than of na|ture, mere accidental differences ari&s;ing
from the &s;ituation of the country or of the cau&s;e. If, for in&s;tance, the
confined fire acts directly under a province or a town, it will heave the earth
perpendicularly upward, and produce a <HI>perpen|dicular</HI> earthquake. If it
acts at a di&s;tance, it <PB N="105" REF="128"> will rai&s;e that tract
obliquely, and thus the in|habitants will perceive an <HI>inclined</HI>
one.</P>
<P>Nor does it &s;eem to me that there is much greater rea&s;on for Mr.
Buffon's di&s;tinction of earthquakes. One kind of which he &s;uppo&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. 328.</BIBL></NOTE> to be produced by fire
in the manner of vol|canoes, and confined to but a very narrow cir|cumference.
The other kind he a&s;cribes to the &s;truggles of confined air, expanded by
heat in the bowels of the earth, and endeavouring to get free. For how do
the&s;e two cau&s;es dif|fer? Fire is an agent of no power what&s;oever without
air. It is the air, which being at fir&s;t compre&s;t, and then dilated in a
cannon, that drives the ball with &s;uch force. It is the air &s;truggling for
vent in a volcano, that throws up its contents to &s;uch va&s;t heights. In
&s;hort, it is the air confined in the bowels of the earth, and acquiring
ela&s;ticity by heat, that produces all tho&s;e appearances which are generally
a&s;crib|ed to the operation of fire. When, therefore, we are told that there
are two cau&s;es of earth|quakes, we only learn, that a greater or &s;maller
quantity of heat produces tho&s;e terrible effects; for air is the only active
operator in either.</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers, however, have been wil|ling to give the air as
great a &s;hare in produc|ing <PB N="106" REF="129"> the&s;e terrible efforts
as they could; and magnifying its powers have called in but a very moderate
degree of heat to put it in action. Although experience tells us that the earth
is full of inflamable materials, and that fires are produced wherever we
de&s;cend; although it tells us that tho&s;e countries, where there are
volcanoes, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to earthquakes, yet they &s;tep out of the way,
and &s;o find a new &s;o|lution. The&s;e only allow but ju&s;t heat enough to
produce the mo&s;t dreadful phoenomena, and backing their a&s;&s;ertions with
long calculations, give theory an air of demon&s;tration. Mr. Amontons<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires de l' Accademie de Sciences, An.
1703.</BIBL></NOTE> has been particularly &s;paring of the internal heat in
this re&s;pect; and has &s;hewn, perhaps accurately enough, that a very
mode|rate degree of heat may &s;uffice to give the air amazing powers of
expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is amazing enough, however, to trace the progre&s;s of a
philo&s;ophical fancy let loo&s;e in immaginary &s;peculations. They run thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"A very moderate degree of heat may bring the air
into a condition capable of producing earthquakes; for the air at the depth of
forty-three thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-eight fathom below the &s;urface
of the earth, becomes almo&s;t as heavy as quick-&s;ilver. 
<PB N="107" REF="130"> This, however, is but a very &s;light depth in
compari&s;on of the di&s;tance to the center, and is &s;carce a &s;eventieth
part of the way. The air, therefore, at the center mu&s;t be infinitely heavier
than mercury, or any body that we know of. This granted, we &s;hall take
&s;ome|thing more, and &s;ay, that it is very probable there is nothing but air
at the center. Now let us &s;uppo&s;e this air heated, by &s;ome means, even to
the degree of boiling water, as we have proved that the den&s;ity of the air is
here very great, its ela&s;ticity mu&s;t be in proportion: an heat, therefore,
which at the &s;urface of the earth would have produced but a &s;light
expan|&s;ive force, mu&s;t at the center produce one very extraordinary, and,
in &s;hort, be perfectly irre|&s;i&s;tible. Hence this force may with great
ea&s;e produce earthquakes; and if encrea&s;ed it may convul&s;e the globe; it
may (by only adding figures enough to the calculation) de&s;troy the &s;olar
&s;y&s;tem, and even the fixed &s;tars them|&s;elves."</Q> The&s;e reveries
generally produce no|thing; for, as I have ever ob&s;erved, encrea&s;ed
calculations, while they &s;eem to tire the me|mory, give the rea&s;oning
faculty perfect re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>However, as earthquakes are the mo&s;t for|midable mini&s;ters of
nature, it is not to be <PB N="108" REF="131"> wondered that a multitude of
writers have been curiou&s;ly employed in their con&s;ideration. Woodward has
a&s;cribed the cau&s;e to a &s;top|page of the waters below the earth's
&s;urface by &s;ome accident. The&s;e being thus accumu|lated, and yet acted
upon by fires, which he &s;uppo&s;es &s;till deeper, both contribute to heave
up the earth upon their bo&s;om. This he thinks accounts for the lakes of water
produced in an earthquake, as well as for the fires that &s;ometimes bur&s;t
from the earth's &s;urface upon tho&s;e dreadful occa&s;ions. There are others
&s;till who have &s;uppo&s;ed that the earth may be it&s;elf the cau&s;e of its
own convul&s;ions. When, &s;ay they, the roots or ba&s;is of &s;ome large tract
is worn away by a fluid underneath, the earth &s;inking therein, its weight
occa&s;ions a tremor of the adjacent parts, &s;ometimes produc|ing a noi&s;e,
and &s;ometimes an inundation of water. Not to tire the reader with an
hi&s;tory of opinions in&s;tead of facts, &s;ome have a&s;cribed them to
electricity, and &s;ome to the &s;ame cau&s;es that produce thunder.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, therefore, to give all the various opinions
that have employed the &s;peculative upon this &s;ubject. The activity of the
internal heat &s;eems alone &s;ufficient to ac|count for every appearance that
attends the&s;e <PB N="109" REF="132"> tremendous irregularities of nature. To
con|ceive this di&s;tinctly, let us &s;uppo&s;e at &s;ome va&s;t di&s;tance
under the earth, large quantities of in|flamable matter, pyrites, bitumens, and
mar|ca&s;ites di&s;po&s;ed, and only waiting for the a&s;|per&s;ion of water,
or the humidity of the air, to put their fires in motion: at la&s;t, this
dreadful mixture arrives; waters find their way into tho&s;e depths, through
the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures; or air in&s;inuates it&s;elf through the &s;ame
minute apertures: &s;trait new appearances en&s;ue: tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances,
which for ages before lay dormant, now conceive new apparent qualities; they
grow hot, produce new air, and only want room for expan&s;ion. However, the
narrow apertures by which the air or water had at fir&s;t admi&s;&s;ion, are
now clo&s;ed up; yet as new air is continually generated, and as the heat every
moment gives this air new ela&s;ticity, it at length bur&s;ts, and dilates all
round; and, in its &s;truggles to get free, throws all above it into &s;imilar
convul&s;ions. Thus an earthquake is produced, more or le&s;s exten&s;ive,
according to the depth or the great|ne&s;s of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But before we proceed with the cau&s;es, let us take a &s;hort view
of the appearances which have attended the mo&s;t remarkable earth|quakes. By
the&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee how far the <PB N="110" REF="133"> theori&s;t
corre&s;ponds with the hi&s;torian. The greate&s;t we find in antiquity, is
that mentioned by Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. lib. ii. cap.
86.</BIBL></NOTE>, in which twelve cities in A&s;ia Minor were &s;wallowed up
in one night: he tells us al&s;o of another, near the lake Thra&s;ymene, which
was not perceived by the armies of the Car|thaginians and Romans, that were
then en|gaged near that lake, although it &s;hook the greate&s;t part of Italy.
In another place<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. lib. iii. cap.
85.</BIBL></NOTE> he gives the following account of an earthquake of an
extraordinary kind. 
<Q REND="inline">"When Lucius Marcus, and Sextus Julius, were
con&s;uls, there appeared a very &s;trange prodigy of the earth, (as I have
read in the books of Aetru&s;can di&s;|cipline) which happened in the province
of Mutina. Two mountains &s;hocked again&s;t each other, approaching and
retiring with the mo&s;t dreadful noi&s;e. They, at the &s;ame time, and in the
mid&s;t of the day, appeared to ca&s;t forth fire and &s;moke, while a va&s;t
number of Roman knights and travellers from the Aemilian way, &s;tood and
continued amazed &s;pectators. Se|veral towns were de&s;troyed by this &s;hock;
and all the animals that were near them were killed."</Q> In the times of
Trajan, the city of Antioch, and a great part of the adjacent country, was
buried by an earthquake. About <PB N="111" REF="134"> three hundred years
after, in the times of Ju&s;tinian, it was once more de&s;troyed, together with
forty thou&s;and inhabitants: and, after an interval of &s;ixty years, the
&s;ame ill-fated city was a third time overturned, with the lo&s;s of not
le&s;s than &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ouls. In the year 1182, mo&s;t of the cities
of Syria, and the king|dom of Jeru&s;alem, were de&s;troyed by the &s;ame
accident. In the year 1594, the Italian hi&s;to|rians de&s;cribe an earthquake
at Puteoli, which cau&s;ed the &s;ea to retire two hundred yards from its
former bed.</P>
<P>But one of tho&s;e mo&s;t particularly de&s;cribed in hi&s;tory, is
that of the year 1693; the damages of which were chiefly felt in Sicily, but
its mo|tion perceived in Germany, France, and Eng|land. It extended to a
circumference of two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred leagues; chiefly affecting the
&s;ea-coa&s;ts, and great rivers; more per|ceivable al&s;o upon the mountains
than in the valleys. Its motions were &s;o rapid, that tho&s;e who lay at their
length, were to&s;&s;ed from &s;ide to &s;ide, as upon a rolling billow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;.</BIBL></NOTE>. The walls were da&s;hed
from their foundations; and no le&s;s than fifty-four cities, with an
incredible num|ber of villages, were either de&s;troyed or greatly damaged. The
city of Catanea, in particular, <PB N="112" REF="135"> was utterly overthrown.
A traveller, who was on his way thither, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles,
perceived a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The &s;ea, all of
a &s;ud|den, began to roar; Mount Aetna to &s;end forth great &s;pires of
flame; and &s;oon after a &s;hock en|&s;ued, with a noi&s;e as if all the
artillery in the world had been at once di&s;charged. Our tra|veller, being
obliged to alight in&s;tantly, felt him&s;elf rai&s;ed a foot from the ground;
and turn|ing his eyes to the city, he with amazement &s;aw nothing but a thick
cloud of du&s;t in the air. The birds flew about a&s;toni&s;hed; the &s;un was
darkened; the bea&s;ts ran howling from the hills; and, although the &s;hock
did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thou&s;and of the
inhabitants of Sicily peri&s;hed in the ruins. Catanea, to which city the
de&s;criber was tra|velling, &s;eemed the principal &s;cene of ruin; its place
only was to be found; and not a foot&s;tep of its former magnificence was to be
&s;een re|maining.</P>
<P>The earthquake which happened in Jamaica, in 1692, was very
terrible, and its de&s;cription &s;ufficiently minute. 
<Q REND="inline">"In two minutes time it de&s;troyed the town of
Portugal, and &s;unk the hou&s;es in a gulph forty fathoms deep. It was
attended with an hollow rumbling noi&s;e, like <PB N="113" REF="136"> that of
thunder; and, in le&s;s than a minute, three parts of the hou&s;es, and their
inhabitants, were all &s;unk quite under water. While they were thus
&s;wallowed up on one &s;ide of the &s;treet, on the other, the hou&s;es were
thrown into heaps; the &s;and of the &s;treet ri&s;ing like the waves of the
&s;ea, lifting up tho&s;e that &s;tood upon it, and immediately overwhelming
them in pits. All the wells di&s;charged their waters with the mo&s;t vehement
agitation. The &s;ea felt an equal &s;hare of turbulence, and, bur&s;ting over
its mounds, deluged all that came in its way. The fi&s;&s;ures of the earth
were, in &s;ome places, &s;o great, that one of the &s;treets appeared twice as
broad as formerly. In many places, however, it opened and clo&s;ed again, and
continued this agitation for &s;ome time. Of the&s;e openings, two or three
hundred might be &s;een at a time; in &s;ome whereof the people were
&s;wallowed up; in others, the earth clo&s;ing, caught them by the middle, and
thus cru&s;hed them in&s;tantly to death. Other openings, &s;till more dreadful
than the re&s;t, &s;wallowed up whole &s;treets; and others, more formidable
&s;till, &s;pouted up whole cataracts of water, drowning &s;uch as the
earthquake had &s;pared. The whole was attended with the mo&s;t noi&s;ome
&s;tench; while the thundering of the di|&s;tant falling mountains, the whole
&s;ky overca&s;t <PB N="114" REF="137"> with a du&s;ky gloom, and the cru&s;h
of falling ha|bitations, gave un&s;peakable horror to the &s;cene. After this
dreadful calamity was over, the whole i&s;land &s;eemed converted into a
&s;cene of de&s;olation; &s;carce a planter's hou&s;e was left &s;tanding;
almo&s;t all were &s;wallowed up; hou&s;es, people, trees, &s;hared one
univer&s;al ruin; and, in their places appeared great pools of water, which,
when dried up by the &s;un, left only a plain of barren &s;and, without any
ve&s;tige of former inhabitants. Mo&s;t of the rivers, during the earthquake,
were &s;topt up by the falling in of the mountains; and it was not till after
&s;ome time that they made them&s;elves new channels. The mountains &s;eemed
particularly attacked by the force of the &s;hock; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that
the principal &s;eat of the concu&s;&s;ion was among them. Tho&s;e who were
&s;aved, got on board &s;hips in the harbour; where many re|mained above two
months, the &s;hocks con|tinuing during that interval with more or le&s;s
violence every day."</Q></P>
<P>As this de&s;cription &s;eems to exhibit all the ap|pearances that
u&s;ually make up the catalogue of terrors belonging to an earthquake, I will
&s;uppre&s;s the detail of that which happened at Li&s;bon, in our own times,
and which is too re|cent to require a de&s;cription. In fact, there are 
<PB N="115" REF="138"> few particulars in the accounts of tho&s;e who were
pre&s;ent at that &s;cene of de&s;olation, that we have not more minutely and
accurately tran&s;|mitted to us by former writers, who&s;e nar|ratives I have
for that rea&s;on preferred. I will, therefore, clo&s;e this de&s;cription of
human cala|mities, with the account of the dreadful earth|quake at Calabria, in
1638. It is related by the celebrated Father Kircher, as it happened while he
was on his journey to vi&s;it Mount Aetna, and the re&s;t of the wonders that
lie towards the &s;outh of Italy. I need &s;carce inform the reader that
Kircher is con&s;idered, by &s;cholars, as one of the greate&s;t prodigies of
learning.</P>

<Q REND="inline">"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, two
friars of the order of St. Francis, and two &s;eculars, we launched, on the
twenty-fourth of March, from the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina, in Sicily, and
arrived, the &s;ame day, at the pro|montory of Pelorus. Our de&s;tination was
for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria, where we had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to
tran&s;act, and where we de&s;igned to tarry for &s;ome time. However,
Providence &s;eemed willing to cro&s;s our de&s;ign; for we were obliged to
continue for three days at Pelorus, upon account of the weather; and though we
often put out to &s;ea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, however,
wea|ried <PB N="116" REF="139"> with the delay, we re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute
our voyage; and, although the &s;ea &s;eemed more than u&s;ually agitated, yet
we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approach|ed, &s;eemed
whirled round in &s;uch a manner as to form a va&s;t hollow, verging to a point
in the center. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to Aetna, I &s;aw it
ca&s;t forth large volumes of &s;moke, of mountainous &s;izes, which entirely
covered the whole i&s;land, and blotted out the very &s;hores from my view.
This, together with the dreadful noi&s;e, and the &s;ulphureous &s;tench, which
was &s;trongly perceived, filled me with apprehen&s;ions that &s;ome more
dreadful cala|mity was impending. The &s;ea it&s;elf &s;eemed to wear a very
unu&s;ual appearance; tho&s;e who have &s;een a lake in a violent &s;hower of
rain co|vered all over with bubbles, will conceive &s;ome idea of its
agitations. My &s;urprize was &s;till encrea&s;ed by the calmne&s;s and
&s;erenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud which might be
&s;uppo&s;ed to put all Nature thus into motion. I therefore warned my
companions that an earthquake was approaching; and, after &s;ome time, making
for the &s;hore with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, we landed at Tropaea, happy
and thankful for having e&s;caped the threaten|ing dangers of the &s;ea. 
<P><PB N="117" REF="140">"But our triumphs at land were of &s;hort
du|ration; for we had &s;carce arrived at the Je&s;uits College in that city,
when our ears were &s;tunned with an horrid &s;ound, re&s;embling that of an
in|finite number of chariots driven fiercely for|ward, the wheels rattling, and
the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a mo&s;t dreadful earthquake en&s;ued;
&s;o that the whole tract upon which we &s;tood, &s;eemed to vibrate, as if we
were in the &s;cale of a balance that continued wavering. This motion, however,
&s;oon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was
thrown pro&s;trate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univer&s;al ruin
round me, redoubled my amazement. The cra&s;h of falling hou&s;es, the
tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to rai&s;e my
terror and de&s;pair. On every &s;ide of me I &s;aw nothing but a &s;cene of
ruin; and dan|ger threatening wherever I &s;hould fly. I com|mended my&s;elf to
God as my la&s;t great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every &s;ub|lunary
happine&s;s! wealth, honour, empire, wi&s;|dom, all mere u&s;ele&s;s &s;ounds,
and as empty as the bubbles in the deep. Ju&s;t &s;tanding on the thre&s;hold
of eternity, nothing but God was my plea&s;ure; and the nearer I approached, I
only loved him the more. After &s;ome time, how|ever, <PB N="118" REF="141">
finding that I remained unhurt, amid&s;t the general concu&s;&s;ion, I
re&s;olved to venture for &s;afety, and running as fa&s;t as I could, reached
the &s;hore, but almo&s;t terrified out of my rea&s;on. I did not &s;earch long
here till I found the boat in which I had landed, and my companions al&s;o,
who&s;e terrors were even greater than mine. Our meeting was not of that kind
where every one is de&s;irous of telling his own happy e&s;cape; it was all
&s;ilence, and a gloomy dread of im|pending terrors.</P> 
<P>"Leaving this &s;eat of de&s;olation, we pro|&s;ecuted our
voyage along the coa&s;ts; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed,
although the earth &s;till continued in violent agitations. But we were
&s;carce arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the
boat; and, in about half an hour, we &s;aw the greate&s;t part of the town, and
the inn at which we had &s;et up, da&s;hed to the ground, and burying all its
inhabitants beneath its ruins.</P> 
<P>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little ve&s;&s;el,
finding no &s;afety at land, and yet, from the &s;mallne&s;s of our boat,
having but a very dangerous continuance at &s;ea, we at length landed at
Lopizium, a ca&s;tle midway between Tropaea and Euphemia, the city to which, as
I <PB N="119" REF="142"> &s;aid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned
my eyes, nothing but &s;cenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and ca&s;tles
levelled to the ground; Strombalo, though at &s;ixty miles di&s;tance, belching
forth flames in an unu&s;ual manner, and with a noi&s;e which I could
di&s;tinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote to
contiguous danger. The rumbling &s;ound of an approaching earthquake, which we
by this time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the con&s;equences; it
every moment &s;eemed to grow louder, and to ap|proach more near. The place on
which we &s;tood now began to &s;hake mo&s;t dreadfully, &s;o that being unable
to &s;tand, my companions and I caught hold of whatever &s;hrub grew next us,
and &s;upported our&s;elves in that manner.</P> 
<P>"After &s;ome time, this violent paroxy&s;m cea&s;ing, we again
&s;tood up, in order to pro|&s;ecute our voyage to Euphaemia, that lay within
&s;ight. In the mean time, while we were pre|paring for this purpo&s;e, I
turned my eyes towards the city, but could &s;ee only a frightful dark cloud,
that &s;eemed to re&s;t upon the place. This the more &s;urprized us, as the
weather was &s;o very &s;erene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud was pa&s;t
away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally &s;unk. Wonderful to
tell! <PB N="120" REF="143"> nothing but a di&s;mal and putrid lake was &s;een
where it &s;tood. We looked about to find &s;ome one that could tell us of its
&s;ad cata&s;trophe, but could &s;ee none. All was become a melancholy
&s;olitude; a &s;cene of hideous de&s;olation. Thus proceeding pen&s;ively
along, in que&s;t of &s;ome human being that could give us &s;ome little
information, we at length &s;aw a boy &s;itting by the &s;hore, and appearing
&s;tupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we enquired concerning the fate of
the city; but he could be got to give us no an&s;wer. We entreated him with
every expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s and pity to tell us; but his &s;en&s;es
were quite wrapt up in the con|templation of the danger he had e&s;caped. We
offered him &s;ome victuals, but he &s;eemed to loath the &s;ight. We &s;till
per&s;i&s;ted in our offices of kindne&s;s; but he only pointed to the place of
the city, like one out of his &s;en&s;es; and then running up into the woods,
was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Eu|phaemia: and as
we continued our melancholy cour&s;e along the &s;hore, the whole coa&s;t, for
the &s;pace of two hundred miles, pre&s;ented nothing but the remains of
cities; and men &s;cattered, without an habitation, over the fields.
Pro|ceeding thus along, we at length ended our di&s;tre&s;sful voyage by
arriving at Naples, after <PB N="121" REF="144"> having e&s;caped a thou&s;and
dangers both at &s;ea and land."</P></Q></P>
<P>The reader, I hope, will excu&s;e me for this long tran&s;lation
from a favourite writer, and that the &s;ooner, as it contains &s;ome
particulars relative' to earthquakes not to be found el&s;e|where. From the
whole of the&s;e accounts we may gather, that the mo&s;t concomitant
cir|cum&s;tances are the&s;e:</P>
<P>A rumbling &s;ound before the earthquake. This proceeds from the
air, or fire, or both, forcing their way through the cha&s;ms of the earth, and
endeavouring to get free, which is al&s;o heard in volcanoes.</P>
<P>A violent agitation, or heaving of the &s;ea, &s;ometimes before and
&s;ometimes after that at land. This agitation is only a &s;imilar effect
produced on the waters with that at land, and may be called, for the &s;ake of
per&s;picuity, a &s;ea-quake; and this, al&s;o, is produced by vol|canoes.</P>
<P>A &s;pouting up of waters to great heights. It is not ea&s;y to
de&s;cribe the manner in which this is performed; but volcanoes al&s;o perform
the &s;ame, Ve&s;uvius being known frequently to eject a va&s;t body of
waters.</P>
<P>A rocking of the earth to and fro, and &s;ome|times a perpendicular
bouncing, if it may be <PB N="122" REF="145"> &s;o called, of the &s;ame. This
difference chiefly ari&s;es from the &s;ituation of the place with re|&s;pect
to the &s;ubterranean fire. Directly under, it lifts; at a farther di&s;tance,
it rocks.</P>
<P>Some earthquakes &s;eem to travel onward, and are felt in different
countries at different hours the &s;ame day. This ari&s;es from the great
&s;hock being given to the earth at one place, and that being communicated
onward by an undulatory motion, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively affects different regions in
its progre&s;s. As the blow given by a &s;tone falling in a lake is not
perceived at the &s;hores till &s;ome time after the fir&s;t
concu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;hock is &s;ometimes in&s;tantaneous, like the explo&s;ion of
gunpowder; and &s;ometimes tremulous, and continuing for &s;everal minutes. The
nearer the place where the &s;hock is fir&s;t given, the more in&s;tantaneous
and &s;imple it appears. At a greater di&s;tance the earth re|doubles the
fir&s;t blow with a &s;ort of vibratory continuation.</P>
<P>As waters have generally &s;o great a &s;hare in producing
earthquakes, it is not to be won|dered that they &s;hould generally follow
tho&s;e breaches made by the force of fire, and ap|pear in the great cha&s;ms
which the earthquake has opened.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable <PB N="123" REF="146">
phoenomena of earthquakes, pre&s;enting a fright|ful a&s;&s;emblage of the
mo&s;t terrible effects of air, earth, fire, and water.</P>
<P>The valley of Solfatara, near Naples, &s;eems to exhibit, in a
minuter degree, whatever is &s;een of this horrible kind on the great theatre
of Nature. This plain, which is about twelve hundred feet long, and a
thou&s;and broad, is em|bo&s;omed in mountains, and has in the middle of it a
lake of noi&s;ome blacki&s;h water, covered with a bitumen, that floats upon
its &s;urface. In every part of this plain, caverns appear &s;moking with
&s;ulphur, and often emitting flames. The earth, wherever we walk over it,
trembles be|neath the feet. Noi&s;es of flames, and the hi&s;&s;ing of waters,
are heard at the bottom. The water &s;ometimes &s;pouts up eight or ten feet
high. The mo&s;t noi&s;ome fumes, foetid water, and &s;ulphu|reous vapours,
offend the &s;mell. A &s;tone thrown into any of the caverns, is ejected again
with con&s;iderable violence. The&s;e appearances gene|rally prevail when the
&s;ea is any way di&s;turbed; and the whole &s;eems to exhibit the appearance
of an earthquake in miniature. However, in this &s;maller &s;cene of wonders,
as well as in the greater, there are many appearances for which perhaps we
&s;hall never account; and many que&s;tions may be a&s;ked, which no
conjectures <PB N="124" REF="147"> can thoroughly re&s;olve. It was the fault
of the philo&s;ophers of the la&s;t age, to be more inqui|&s;itive after the
cau&s;es of things, than after the things them&s;elves. They &s;eemed to think
that a confe&s;&s;ion of ignorance cancelled their claims to wi&s;dom: they,
therefore, had a &s;olution for every demand. But the pre&s;ent age has grown,
if not more inqui&s;itive, at lea&s;t more mode&s;t; and none are now a&s;hamed
of that ignorance which labour can neither remedy nor remove.</P>

<P>HITHERTO we have taken a &s;urvey only of the evils which are
produced by &s;ubterranean fires, but we have mentioned nothing of the
be|nefits they may po&s;&s;ibly produce. They may be of u&s;e in warming and
cheri&s;hing the ground, in promoting vegetation, and giving a more
ex|qui&s;ite flavour to the productions of the earth. The imagination of a
per&s;on who has never been out of our own mild region, can &s;carcely reach to
that luxuriant beauty with which all Nature appears cloathed in tho&s;e very
countries that we <PB N="125" REF="148"> have but ju&s;t now de&s;cribed as
de&s;olated by earthquakes, and undermined by &s;ubterranean fires. It mu&s;t
be granted, therefore, that though in tho&s;e regions they have a greater
&s;hare in the dangers, they have al&s;o a larger pro|portion in the benefits
of Nature.</P>
<P>But there is another advantage ari&s;ing from &s;ubterranean fires,
which, though hitherto di&s;|regarded by man, yet may one day become
&s;erviceable to him; I mean, that while they are found to &s;wallow up cities
and plains in one place, they are al&s;o known to produce promon|taries and
i&s;lands in another. We have many in&s;tances of i&s;lands being thus formed
in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, which though for a long time barrren, have
afterwards become fruitful &s;eats of happine&s;s and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>New i&s;lands are formed in two ways; either &s;uddenly, by the
action of &s;ubterraneous fires; or more &s;lowly, by the depo&s;ition of mud,
car|ried down by rivers, and &s;topped by &s;ome ac|cident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 343.</BIBL></NOTE>. With re&s;pect
particularly to the fir&s;t, ancient hi&s;torians, and modern travellers, give
us &s;uch accounts as we can have no room to doubt of. Seneca a&s;&s;ures us,
that in his time the i&s;land of Thera&s;ia appeared unexpectedly to &s;ome
mariners, as they were employed in <PB N="126" REF="149"> another pur&s;uit.
Pliny a&s;&s;ures us, that thirteen i&s;lands in the Mediterranean appeared at
once emerging from the water; the cau&s;e of which he a&s;cribes rather to the
retiring of the &s;ea in tho&s;e parts, than to any &s;ubterraneous elevation.
However, he mentions the i&s;land of Hiera, near that of Thera&s;ia, as formed
by &s;ubterraneous explo&s;ions; and adds to his li&s;t &s;everal others,
formed in the &s;ame manner. In one of which he relates that fi&s;h in great
abundance were found, and that all tho&s;e who eat of them died &s;hortly
after.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"On the twenty-fourth of May<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. del Accad. an. 1708, p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the
year 1707, a &s;light earthquake was perceived at Santorin; and the day
following, at &s;un-ri&s;ing, an object was &s;een by the inhabitants of that
i&s;land, at two or three miles di&s;tance at &s;ea, which appeared like a
floating rock. Some per|&s;ons, de&s;irous either of gain, or incited by
cu|rio&s;ity, went there, and found, even while they &s;tood upon this rock,
that it &s;eemed to ri&s;e be|neath their feet. They perceived al&s;o, that its
&s;urface was covered with pumice &s;tones, and oy&s;ters, which it had
rai&s;ed from the bottom. Every day after, until the fourteenth of June, this
rock &s;eemed con&s;iderably to encrea&s;e; and then was found to be half a
mile round, and <PB N="127" REF="150"> about thirty feet above the &s;ea. The
earth of which it was compo&s;ed, &s;eemed whiti&s;h, with a &s;mall portion of
clay. Soon after this the &s;ea again appeared troubled, and &s;teams aro&s;e,
which were very offen&s;ive to the inhabitants of San|torin. But on the
&s;ixteenth of the &s;ucceeding month, &s;eventeen or eighteen rocks more were
&s;een to ri&s;e out of the &s;ea, and at length to join together. All this was
accompanied with the mo&s;t terrible noi&s;e, and fires that proceeded from the
i&s;land that was newly formed. The whole ma&s;s, however, of all this
new-formed earth, uniting, encrea&s;ed every day, both in height and breadth,
and, by the force of its explo&s;ions, ca&s;t forth rocks to &s;even miles
di&s;tance. This continued to bear the &s;ame dreadful appearances till the
month of Novem|ber in the &s;ame year; and it is at pre&s;ent a vol|cano which
&s;ometimes renews its explo&s;ions. It is about three miles in circumference;
and more than from thirty-five to forty feet high."</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems extraordinary, that about this place in particular,
i&s;lands have appeared at different times, particularly that of Hiera,
mentioned above, which has received con&s;iderable addi|tions in &s;ucceeding
ages. Ju&s;tin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ju&s;tin, l. 30, cap.

<PB N="128" REF="151"> the Romans, a new i&s;land appeared between tho&s;e of
Theramenes and Thera&s;ia, by means of an earthquake. We are told, that this
became half as big again about a thou&s;and years after; another i&s;land
ri&s;ing up by its &s;ide, and joining to it, &s;o as &s;carce at pre&s;ent to
be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the former.</P>
<P>A new i&s;land was formed, in the year 1720, near that of Tercera,
near the continent of Africa, by the &s;ame cau&s;es. In the beginning of
December, at night, there was a terrible earthquake at that place, and the top
of a new i&s;land appeared, which ca&s;t forth &s;moke in va&s;t quantities.
The pilot of a &s;hip, who approached it, &s;ounded on one &s;ide of this
i&s;land, and could not find ground at &s;ixty fathom. At the other &s;ide the
&s;ea was totally tinged of a different colour, exhibiting a mixture of white,
blue, and green; and was very &s;hallow. This i&s;land, on its fir&s;t
appearance, was larger than it is at pre&s;ent; for it has, &s;ince that time,
&s;unk in &s;uch a manner, as to be &s;carce above water.</P>

<P>Such are his &s;entiments; however, there are few of the&s;e
appearances any way more extraordinary than tho&s;e attending volcanoes and
earthquakes in general. We are not more to be &s;urprized that inflammable
&s;ub|&s;tances &s;hould be found beneath the bottom of the &s;ea, than at
&s;imilar depths at land. The&s;e <PB N="130" REF="153"> have all the force of
fire giving expan&s;ion to air, and tending to rai&s;e the earth at the bot|tom
of the &s;ea, till it at length heaves above water. The&s;e marine volcanoes
are not &s;o fre|quent; for, if we may judge of the u&s;ual pro|cedure of
Nature, it mu&s;t very often happen that, before the bottom of the &s;ea is
elevated above the &s;urface, a cha&s;m is opened in it, and then the water
pre&s;&s;ing in, extingui&s;hes the vol|cano before it has time to produce its
effects. This extinction, however, is not effected with|out very great
re&s;i&s;tance from the fire beneath. The water, upon da&s;hing into the
cavern, is very probably at fir&s;t ejected back with great violence; and thus
&s;ome of tho&s;e amazing water|&s;pouts are &s;een, which have &s;o often
a&s;toni&s;hed the mariner, and excited curio&s;ity.&mdash;But of the&s;e in
their place.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the production of tho&s;e i&s;lands by the action of fire,
there are others, as was &s;aid, pro|duced by rivers or &s;eas carrying mud,
earth, and &s;uch like &s;ub&s;tances, along with their cur|rents; and at
la&s;t depo&s;iting them in &s;ome par|ticular place. At the mouths of mo&s;t
great rivers, there are to be &s;een banks, thus formed by the &s;and and mud
carried down with the &s;tream, which have re&s;ted at that place, where the
force of the current is dimini&s;hed by its junction with the &s;ea. The&s;e
banks, by &s;low <PB N="131" REF="154"> degrees, encrea&s;e at the bottom of
the deep; the water, in tho&s;e places, is at fir&s;t found by mariners to grow
more &s;hallow; the bank &s;oon heaves up above the &s;urface; it is
con&s;idered, for a while, as a tract of u&s;ele&s;s and barren &s;and; but the
&s;eeds of &s;ome of the more hardy vege|tables are driven thither by the wind,
they take root, and thus binding the &s;andy &s;urface, the whole &s;pot is
cloathed in time with a beautiful verdure. In this manner there are delightful
and inhabited i&s;lands at the mouths of many rivers, particularly the Nile,
the Po, the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi, the Ganges, and the Senegal. There has been, in
the memory of man, a beautiful and large i&s;land formed in this manner, at the
mouth of the river Nanquin, in China, made from de|po&s;itions of mud at its
opening: it is not le&s;s than &s;ixty miles long, and about twenty broad. La
Loubere informs us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Curieu&s;es et
Edificantes, &s;ec. xi, p. 234.</BIBL></NOTE>, in his voyage to Siam, that
the&s;e &s;and-banks encrea&s;e every day, at the mouths of all the great
rivers in A&s;ia: and hence he a&s;&s;erts, that the navigation up the&s;e
rivers becomes every day more difficult; and will, at one time or another, be
totally ob|&s;tructed. The &s;ame may be remarked with re|gard to the Wolga,
which has at pre&s;ent &s;e|venty openings into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea; and of 
<PB N="132" REF="155"> the Danube, which has &s;even into the Euxine. We have
had an in&s;tance of the formation of a new i&s;land, not very long &s;ince, at
the mouth of the Humber, in England. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is yet within the memory of man," &s;ays the
relator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil Tran&s;. vol. iv. p.
251.</BIBL></NOTE>, "&s;ince it began to rai&s;e its head above the ocean. It
began its appearance at low water, for the &s;pace of a few hours; and was
buried again till the next tide's retreat. Thus, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, it lived
and died, until the year 1666, when it began to maintain its ground again&s;t
the in&s;ult of the waves; and then fir&s;t invited the aid of human
indu&s;try. A bank was thrown about its ri&s;ing grounds; and being thus
defended from the in|cur&s;ions of the &s;ea, it became firm and &s;olid, and,
in a &s;hort time, afforded good pa&s;turage for cattle. It is about nine miles
in circumference, and is worth to the proprietor about eight hundred pounds a
year."</Q> It would be endle&s;s to mention all the i&s;lands that have been
thus formed; and the advantages that have been de|rived from them. However, it
is frequently found, that new i&s;lands thus formed, may often be con&s;idered
as only turning the rivers from their former beds; &s;o that, in proportion as
land is gained at one part, it is lo&s;t by the overflow|ing of &s;ome
other.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="156">Little, therefore, is gained by &s;uch
acce&s;&s;ions. Nor is there much more by the new i&s;lands which are
&s;ometimes formed from the &s;poils of the continent. Mariners a&s;&s;ure us,
that there are &s;ometimes whole plains unrooted from the main lands, by floods
and tempe&s;ts. The&s;e be|ing carried out to &s;ea, with all their trees and
animals upon them, are frequently &s;een float|ing in the ocean, and exhibiting
a &s;urprizing appearance of rural tranquillity in the mid&s;t of danger. The
greate&s;t part, however, having the earth at their roots at length wa&s;hed
away, are di&s;per&s;ed, and their animals drowned; but now and then &s;ome are
found to brave the fury of the ocean, till being &s;tuck either among rocks or
&s;ands, they again take firm footing, and become permanent i&s;lands.</P>
<P>As different cau&s;es have thus concurred to produce new i&s;lands,
&s;o we have accounts of others that the &s;ame cau&s;es have contributed to
de&s;troy. We have already &s;een the power of earthquakes exerted in &s;inking
whole cities, and leaving lakes in their room. There have been i&s;lands, and
regions al&s;o, that have &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and have &s;unk with their
inhabitants, never more to be heard of. Thus Pau&s;anias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pau&s;anias, I.8, in Arcad. p. 509.</BIBL></NOTE> tells us
of an i&s;land, called Chry&s;es, that was <PB N="134" REF="157"> &s;unk near
Lemnos. Pliny mentions &s;everal; among others, the i&s;land Cea, for thirty
miles, having been wa&s;hed away, with &s;everal thou&s;ands of its
inhabitants. But of all the noted de|va&s;tations of this kind, the total
&s;ubmer&s;ion of the i&s;land of Atalantis, as mentioned by Plato, has been
mo&s;t the &s;ubject of &s;peculation. Man|kind, in general, now con&s;ider the
whole of his account as an ingenious fable; but when fables are grown famous by
time and authority, they become an agreeable, if not a nece&s;&s;ary part of
literary information.</P>
<P>About nine thou&s;and years are pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ays Plato<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plato in Critia.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;ince the i&s;land of
Atalantis was in being. The prie&s;ts of Egypt were well ac|quainted with it;
and the fir&s;t heroes of Athens gained much glory in their wars with the
inha|bitants. This i&s;land was as large as A&s;ia Minor and Syria united; and
was &s;ituated beyond the pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic ocean. The
beauty of the buildings, and the fertility of the &s;oil, were far beyond any
thing a modern ima|gination can conceive; gold and ivory were every where
common; and the fruits of the earth offered them&s;elves without cultivation.
The arts, and the courage of the inhabitants, were not inferior to the
happine&s;s of their &s;itu|ation; <PB N="135" REF="158"> and they were
frequently known to make conque&s;ts, and overrun the continent of Europe and
A&s;ia. The imagination of the po|etical philo&s;opher riots in the
de&s;cription of the natural and acquired advantages, which they long enjoyed
in this charming region. If, &s;ays he, we compare that country to our own,
ours will appear a mere wa&s;ted &s;keleton, when op|po&s;ed to it. Their
mountains to the very tops were cloathed with fertility, and poured down rivers
to enrich the plains below.</P>
<P>However, all the&s;e beauties and benefits were de&s;troyed in one
day by an earthquake &s;inking the earth, and the &s;ea overwhelming it. At
pre&s;ent, not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tiges of &s;uch an i&s;land are to be
found; Plato remains as the only authority for its exi&s;tence; and
philo&s;ophers di&s;pute about its &s;ituation. It is not for me to enter into
the controver&s;y, when there appears but little probability to &s;upport the
fact; and, indeed, it would be u&s;ele&s;s to run back nine thou&s;and years in
&s;earch of difficulties, as we are &s;urrounded with objects that more
clo&s;ely affect us, and that demand admiration at our very doors. When I
con&s;ider, as Lactantius &s;ug|ge&s;ts, the various vici&s;&s;itudes of
nature; lands &s;wallowed by yawning earthquakes, or over|whelmed in the deep;
rivers and lakes di&s;ap|pearing, <PB N="136" REF="159"> or dried away;
mountains levelled into plains; and plains &s;welling up into moun|tains; I
cannot help regarding this earth as a place of very little &s;tability; as a
tran&s;ient abode of &s;till more tran&s;itory beings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING at la&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, emerged from the deeps of the
earth, we come to a &s;cene of greater &s;plendour; the contemplation of its
external appearance. In this &s;urvey, its moun|tains are the fir&s;t objects
that &s;trike the ima|gination, and excite our curio&s;ity. There is not,
perhaps, any thing in all nature that im|pre&s;&s;es an unaccu&s;tomed
&s;pectator with &s;uch ideas of awful &s;olemnity, as the&s;e immen&s;e piles
of Nature's erecting, that &s;eem to mock the minutene&s;s of human
magnificence.</P>
<P>In countries where there are nothing but plains, the &s;malle&s;t
elevations are apt to excite wonder. In Holland, which is all a flat, they
&s;hew a little ridge of hills, near the &s;ea-&s;ide, which Boerhaave
generally marked out to his pupils as being mountains of no &s;mall
con|&s;ideration. <PB N="137" REF="160"> What would be the &s;en&s;ations of
&s;uch an auditory, could they at once be pre|&s;ented with a view of the
heights and precipices of the Alps, or the Andes! Even among us in England, we
have no adequate ideas of a moun|tain-pro&s;pect; our hills are generally
&s;loping from the plain, and cloathed to the very top with verdure; we can
&s;carce, therefore, lift our imaginations to tho&s;e immen&s;e piles who&s;e
tops peep up behind intervening clouds, &s;harp and precipitate, and reach to
heights that human avarice or curio&s;ity have never been able to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>We, in this part of the world, are not, for that rea&s;on, &s;o
immediately intere&s;ted in the que&s;tion which has &s;o long been agitated
among philo&s;ophers, concerning what gave ri&s;e to the&s;e inequalities on
the &s;urface of the globe. In our own happy region, we generally &s;ee no
inequa|lities but &s;uch as contribute to u&s;e and beauty; and we, therefore,
are amazed at a que&s;tion en|quiring how &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary inequalities
came to be formed, and &s;eeming to expre&s;s a wonder how the globe comes to
be &s;o beautiful as we find it. But though with us there may be no great
cau&s;e for &s;uch a demand, yet in tho&s;e places where mountains deform the
face of Nature, where they pour down cataracts, or give fury 
<PB N="138" REF="161"> to tempe&s;ts, there &s;eems to be good rea&s;on for
enquiry either into their cau&s;es or their u&s;es. It has been, therefore,
a&s;ked by many, in what manner mountains have come to be formed; or for what
u&s;es they are de&s;igned?</P>
<P>To &s;atisfy curio&s;ity in the&s;e re&s;pects, much rea&s;oning has
been employed, and very little knowledge propagated. With regard to the fir&s;t
part of the demand, the manner in which mountains were formed, we have already
&s;een the conjectures of different philo&s;ophers on that head. One
&s;uppo&s;ing that they were formed from the earth's broken &s;hell, at the
time of the deluge: another, that they exi&s;ted from the creation, and only
acquired their deformities in proce&s;s of time: a third, that they owed their
original to earthquakes: and &s;till a fourth, with much more plau&s;ibility
than the re&s;t, a&s;cribing them entirely to the fluctuations of the deep,
which he &s;uppo&s;es in the beginning to have covered the whole earth. Such as
are plea&s;ed with di&s;qui&s;itions of this kind, may con&s;ult Burnet,
Whi&s;ton, Wood|ward, or Buffon. Nor would I be thought to decry any mental
amu&s;ements, that at wor&s;t keep us innocently employed; but, for my own
part, I cannot help wondering how the oppo&s;ite demand has never come to be
made; and why <PB N="139" REF="162"> philo&s;ophers have never a&s;ked how we
come to have plains? Plains are &s;ometimes more preju|dicial to man than
mountains. Upon plains, an inundation has greater power; the beams of the &s;un
are often collected there with &s;uffocat|ing fiercene&s;s; they are
&s;ometimes found de&s;ert for &s;everal hundred miles together, as in the
country ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, although other|wi&s;e fruitful, merely
becau&s;e there are no ri&s;ings nor depre&s;&s;ions to form re&s;ervoirs, or
collect the &s;malle&s;t rivulet of water. The mo&s;t rational an&s;wer,
therefore, why either mountains or plains were formed, &s;eems to be, that they
were thus fa&s;hioned by the hand of Wi&s;dom, in order that pain and
plea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;o contiguous as that morality might be ex|erci&s;ed
either in bearing the one, or commu|nicating the other.</P>
<P>Indeed, the more I con&s;ider this di&s;pute re|&s;pecting the
formation of mountains, the more I am &s;truck with the futility of the
que&s;tion. There is neither a &s;trait line, nor an exact &s;uper|ficies, in
all nature. If we con&s;ider a circle, even with mathematical preci&s;ion, we
&s;hall find it formed of a number of &s;mall right lines, joining at angles
together. The&s;e angles, there|fore, may be con&s;idered in a circle as
mountains are upon our globe; and to demand the rea&s;on <PB N="140" REF="163">
for the one being mountainous, or the other angular, is only to a&s;k why a
circle is a circle, or a globe is a globe. In &s;hort, if there be no &s;urface
without inequality in Nature, why &s;hould we be &s;urprized that the earth has
&s;uch? It has often been &s;aid, that the inequa|lities of its &s;urface are
&s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable, if compared to its magnitude; and I think we have
every rea&s;on to be content with the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Some, however, have avoided the difficulty by urging the final
cau&s;e. They alledge that mountains have been formed merely becau&s;e they are
u&s;eful to man. This carries the en|quirer but a part of the way; for no one
can affirm that in all places they are u&s;eful. The contrary is known, by
horrid experience, in tho&s;e valleys that are &s;ubject to their influence.
However, as the utility of any part of our earthly habitation, is a very
plea&s;ing and flatter|ing &s;peculation to every philo&s;opher, it is not to
be wondered that much has been &s;aid to prove the u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e.
For this pur|po&s;e, many conjectures have been made that have received a
degree of a&s;&s;ent even beyond their evidence; for men were unwilling to
be|come more mi&s;erably wi&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, as one principal ad|vantage 
<PB N="141" REF="164"> that we derive from them, that they &s;erve, like hoops
or ribs, to &s;trengthen our earth, and to bind it together. In con&s;equence
of this theory, Kircher has given us a map of the earth, in this manner hooped
with its moun|tains; which might have a much more &s;olid foundation, did it
entirely corre&s;pond with truth.</P>
<P>Others have found a different u&s;e for them, e&s;pecially when they
run &s;urrounding our globe; which is, that they &s;top the vapours that are
continually travelling from the equator to the poles; for the&s;e being urged
by the heat of the &s;un, from the warm regions of the line, mu&s;t all be
accumulated at the poles, if they were not &s;topped in their way by tho&s;e
high ridges of mountains which cro&s;s their direction. But an an&s;wer to this
may be, that all the great moun|tains in America lie lengthwi&s;e, and
therefore do not cro&s;s their direction.</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e remote advantages, others a&s;&s;ert, that not
only the animal but vegetable part of the creation would peri&s;h for want of
convenient humidity, were it not for their friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their
&s;ummits are, by the&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ed to arre&s;t, as it were, the vapours
which float in the regions of the air. Their large inflexions, and channels,
are con&s;idered as <PB N="142" REF="165"> &s;o many ba&s;ons prepared for the
reception of tho&s;e thick vapours, and impetuous rains, which de&s;cend into
them. The huge caverns beneath are &s;o many magazines or con&s;ervatories of
water for the peculiar &s;ervice of man: and tho&s;e orifices by which the
water is di&s;charged upon the plain, are &s;o &s;ituated as to enrich and
render them fruitful, in&s;tead of returning through &s;ubterraneous channels
to the &s;ea, after the performance of a tedious and fruitle&s;s
cir|culation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Nature Di&s;play'd, vol. iii. p.
88.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>However this be, certain it is that al|mo&s;t all our great rivers
find their &s;ource among mountains; and, in general, the more exten&s;ive the
mountain, the greater the river: thus the river Amazons, the greate&s;t in the
world, has its &s;ource among the Andes, which are the highe&s;t mountains on
the globe; the river Niger travels a long cour&s;e of &s;everal hundred miles
from the mountains of the Moon, the highe&s;t in all Africa; and the Da|nube
and the Rhine proceed from the Alps, which are probably the highe&s;t mountains
of Europe.</P>
<P>It need &s;carce be &s;aid that, with re&s;pect to height, there are
many &s;izes of mountains, from the gently ri&s;ing upland, to the tall craggy 
<PB N="143" REF="166"> precipice. The appearance is in general differ|ent in
tho&s;e of different magnitudes. The fir&s;t are cloathed with verdure to the
very tops, and only &s;eem to a&s;cend to improve our pro&s;pects, or &s;upply
us with a purer air: but the lofty mountains of the other cla&s;s have a very
dif|ferent a&s;pect. At a di&s;tance their tops are &s;een, in wavy ridges, of
the very colour of the clouds, and only to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from them by
their figure, which, as I have &s;aid, re&s;embles the billows of the
&s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lettres Philo&s;ophiques &s;ur la
Formation, &amp;c. p. 196.</BIBL></NOTE>. As we approach, the mountain
a&s;&s;umes a deeper colour; it gathers upon the &s;ky, and &s;eems to hide
half the horizon behind it. Its &s;ummits al&s;o are become more di&s;tinct,
and appear with a broken and perpendicular line. What at fir&s;t &s;eemed a
&s;ingle hill, is now found to be a chain of con|tinued mountains, who&s;e tops
running along in ridges, are embo&s;omed in each other; &s;o that the
curvatures of one are fitted to the promi|nences of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and
form a winding valley between, often of &s;everal miles in ex|tent; and all the
way continuing nearly of the &s;ame breadth. Nothing can be finer, or more
exact than Mr. Pope's de&s;cription of a traveller &s;training up the Alps.
Every mountain he comes to he thinks will be the la&s;t; he finds, 
<PB N="144" REF="167"> however, an unexpected hill ri&s;e before him; and that
being &s;caled, he finds the highe&s;t &s;um|mit almo&s;t at as great a
di&s;tance as before. Upon quitting the plain, he might have left a green and a
fertile &s;oil, and a climate warm and plea&s;ing. As he a&s;cends, the ground
a&s;&s;umes a more ru&s;&s;et colour; the gra&s;s becomes more mo&s;&s;y; and
the weather more moderate. Still as he a&s;cends, the weather becomes more
cold, and the earth more barren. In this dreary pa&s;&s;age, he is often
entertained with a little valley of &s;urprizing verdure, cau&s;ed by the
reflected heat of the &s;un collected into a narrow &s;pot on the &s;urrounding
heights. But it much more frequently happens that he &s;ees only frightful
precipices beneath, and lakes of amazing depths; from whence rivers are formed,
and fountains derive their original. On tho&s;e places next the highe&s;t
&s;ummits, ve|getation is &s;carcely carried on; here and there a few plants of
the mo&s;t hardy kind appear: The air is intolerably cold; either continually
refrigerated with fro&s;ts, or di&s;turbed with tem|pe&s;ts. All the ground
here wears an eternal covering of ice, and &s;nows that &s;eem con&s;tantly
accumulating. Upon emerging from this war of the elements, he a&s;cends into a
purer and a &s;erener region, where vegetation is entirely

&s;uppo&s;e that this picture exhibits either a con&s;tant or an invariable
likene&s;s of tho&s;e &s;tupendous heights. Indeed, nothing can be more
capricious or irre|gular than the forms of many of them. The tops of &s;ome run
in ridges for a con&s;iderable length, without interruption; in others, the
line &s;eems notched by great vallies to an amazing depth. Sometimes a
&s;olitary and a &s;ingle moun|tain ri&s;es from the bo&s;om of the plain; and

that the rapidity of the earth's motion in the&s;e parts, together with the
great|ne&s;s of the tides there, may have thrown up tho&s;e &s;tupendous
ma&s;&s;es of earth. But, be the cau&s;e as it may, it is a remarkable fact,
that the inequalities of the earth's &s;urface are greate&s;t there. Near the
Poles, the earth, indeed, is craggy and uneven enough; but the heights of the
mountains there, are very incon&s;iderable. On the contrary, at the Equator,
where Nature &s;eems to &s;port in the amazing &s;ize of all her productions,
the plains are exten&s;ive; and the mountains remarkably lofty. Some of them
are known to ri&s;e three miles perpendicular above the bed of the ocean.</P>
<P>To enumerate the mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e, according to their
&s;ize, we &s;hall begin with the Andes, of which we have an excellent
de&s;crip|tion by Ulloa, who went thither by command of the king of Spain, in
company with the French Academicians, to mea&s;ure a degree of the meridian.
His journey up the&s;e <PB N="147" REF="170"> mountains is too curious not to
give an extract from it.</P>
<P>After many incommodious days &s;ailing up the river Guayaquil, he
arrived at Caracol, a town &s;ituated at the foot of the Andes. Nothing could
exceed the inconveniencies which he ex|perienced in this voyage, from the flies
and mo&s;chitoes (an animal re&s;embling our gnat). 
<Q REND="inline">"We were the whole day," &s;ays he, "in con|tinual
motion to keep them off; but at night our torments were exce&s;&s;ive. Our
gloves, indeed, were &s;ome defence to our hands; but our faces were entirely
expo&s;ed; nor were our cloaths a &s;ufficient defence for the re&s;t of our
bodies; for their &s;tings penetrating through the cloth, cau&s;ed a very
painful and fiery itching. One night, in coming to an anchor near a large and
hand&s;ome hou&s;e that was uninhabited, we had no &s;ooner &s;eated
our&s;elves in it, than we were attacked on all &s;ides by &s;warms of
mo&s;chi|toes, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to have one mo|ment's quiet.
Tho&s;e who had covered them|&s;elves with cloaths made for this purpo&s;e,
found not the &s;malle&s;t defence; wherefore, hoping to find &s;ome relief in
the open fields, they ventured out, though in danger of &s;uffering in a more
terrible manner from the &s;erpents. But both places were equally obnoxious. On
quitting <PB N="148" REF="171"> this inho&s;pitable retreat, we the next night
took up our quarters in an hou&s;e that was in|habited; the ho&s;t of which
being informed of the terrible manner we had pa&s;t the night be|fore, he
gravely told us, that the hou&s;e we &s;o greatly complained of, had been
for&s;aken on account of its being the purgatory of a &s;oul. But we had more
rea&s;on to believe that it was quitted on account of its being the purgatory
of the body. After having journeyed for up|wards of three days, through boggy
roads, in which the mules at every &s;tep &s;unk up to their bellies, we began
at length to perceive an al|teration in the climate; and having been long
accu&s;tomed to heat, we now began to feel it grown &s;en&s;ibly colder. 
<P>"It is remarkable, that at Tariguagua we often &s;ee in&s;tances
of the effects of two oppo&s;ite temperatures, in two per&s;ons happening to
meet; one of them leaving the plains below, and the other de&s;cending from the
mountain. The former thinks the cold &s;o &s;evere, that he wraps him&s;elf up
in all the garments he can procure; while the latter, finds the heat &s;o
great, that he is &s;carce able to bear any cloaths what&s;oever. The one
thinks the water &s;o cold, that he avoids being &s;prinkled by it; the other
is &s;o delighted with its warmth, that he u&s;es it <PB N="149" REF="172"> as
a bath. Nor is the ca&s;e very different in the &s;ame per&s;on, who
experiences the &s;ame diver|&s;ity of &s;en&s;ation upon his journey up, and
upon his return. This difference only proceeds from the change naturally felt
at leaving a climate to which one has been accu&s;tomed, and coming into
another of an oppo&s;ite temperature.</P> 
<P>"The ruggedne&s;s of the road from Tarigua|gua, leading up the
mountain, is not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. In &s;ome parts, the declivity is &s;o
great, that the mules can &s;carce keep their footing; and in others, the
acclivity is equally difficult. The trouble of having people going before to
mend the road, the pains ari&s;ing from the many falls and brui&s;es, and the
being con|&s;tantly wet to the &s;kin, might be &s;upported, were not the&s;e
inconveniences augmented by the &s;ight of &s;uch frightful precipices, and
deep aby&s;&s;es, as mu&s;t fill the mind with cea&s;ele&s;s terror. There are
&s;ome places where the road is &s;o &s;teep, and yet &s;o narrow, that the
mules are obliged to &s;lide down, without making any u&s;e of their feet
what&s;oever. On one &s;ide of the rider, in this &s;ituation, ri&s;es an
eminence of &s;everal hun|dred yards; and on the other, an aby&s;s of equal
depth; &s;o that if he in the lea&s;t checks his mule, &s;o as to de&s;troy the
equilibrium, they both mu&s;t unavoidably peri&s;h.</P> 
<P><PB N="150" REF="173">"After having travelled about nine days in
this manner, &s;lowly winding along the &s;ide of the mountain, we began to
find the whole country covered with an hoar fro&s;t, and an hut, in which we
lay, had ice on it. Having e&s;caped many perils, we at length, after a journey
of fifteen days, arrived upon the plain, on the ex|tremity of which &s;tands
the city of Quito, the capital of one of the mo&s;t charming regions upon
earth. Here, in the center of the torrid zone, the heat is not only very
tolerable, but in &s;ome places the cold al&s;o is painful. Here they enjoy all
the temperature and advantages of perpetual &s;pring; their fields being always
covered with verdure, and enamelled with flowers of the mo&s;t lively colours.
However, although this beautiful region be higher than any other country in the
world, and although it took up &s;o many days of painful journey in the
a&s;cent, it is &s;till overlooked by tremendous mountains; their &s;ides
covered with &s;now, and yet flaming with volcanoes at the top. The&s;e &s;eem
piled one upon the other, and ri&s;e to a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing height, with
great coldne&s;s. However, at a determined point above the &s;urface of the
&s;ea, the congelation is found at the &s;ame height in all the mountains.
Tho&s;e parts which are not &s;ubject to a continual fro&s;t, 
<PB N="151" REF="174"> have here and there growing upon them a ru&s;h,
re&s;embling the geni&s;ta, but much more &s;oft and flexible. Towards the
extremity of the part where the ru&s;h grows, and the cold begins to
encrea&s;e, is found a vegetable, with a round bulbous head, which, when dried,
becomes of amazing ela&s;ticity. Higher up the earth is en|tirely bare of
vegetation, and &s;eems covered with eternal &s;now. The mo&s;t remarkable
moun|tains are, that of Cotopaxi, (already de&s;cribed as a volcano)
Chimborazo, and Pichincha. Co|topaxi is more than three geographical miles
above the &s;urface of the &s;ea: the re&s;t are not much inferior. On the top
of the latter was my &s;tation for mea&s;uring a degree of the me|ridian; where
I &s;uffered particular hard&s;hips, from the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, and
the vio|lence of the &s;torms. The &s;ky around was, in general, involved in
thick fogs, which, when they cleared away, and the clouds, by their gravity,
moved nearer to the &s;urface of the earth, they appeared &s;urrounding the
foot of the mountain, at a va&s;t di&s;tance below, like a &s;ea,
encompa&s;&s;ing an i&s;land in the mid&s;t of it. When this happened, the
horrid noi&s;es of tem|pe&s;ts were heard from beneath, then di&s;charging
them&s;elves on Quito, and the neighbouring <PB N="152" REF="175"> country. I
&s;aw the lightenings i&s;&s;ue from the clouds, and heard the thunders roll
far beneath me. All this time, while the tempe&s;t was raging below, the
mountain top, where I was placed, enjoyed a delightful &s;erenity; the wind was
abated; the &s;ky clear; and the enlivening rays of the &s;un moderated the
&s;everity of the cold. However, this was of no very long du|ration, for the
wind returned with all its vio|lence, and with &s;uch velocity as to dazzle the
&s;ight; whil&s;t my fears were encrea&s;ed by the dreadful concu&s;&s;ions of
the precipice, and the fall of enormous rocks; the only &s;ounds that were
heard in this frightful &s;ituation."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the animated picture of the&s;e moun|tains, as given us by
this ingenious Spaniard: and I believe the reader will wi&s;h that I had made
the quotation &s;till longer. A pa&s;&s;age over the Alps, or a journey
acro&s;s the Pyrenees, appear petty trips or excur&s;ions, in the compari&s;on;
and yet the&s;e are the mo&s;t lofty mountains we know of in Europe.</P>
<P>If we compare the Alps with the mountains already de&s;cribed, we
&s;hall find them but little more than one half of the height of the former.
The Andes, upon being mea&s;ured by the baro|meter, are found above three
thou&s;and, one <PB N="153" REF="176"> hundred and thirty-&s;ix toi&s;es or
fathoms above the &s;urface of the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa,
vol. i. p. 442.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whereas the highe&s;t point of the Alps is not
above &s;ixteen hundred. The one, in other words, is above three miles high;
the other, about a mile and a half. The highe&s;t mountains of A&s;ia are,
Mount Taurus, Mount Immaus, Mount Cauca&s;us, and the mountains of
Japan.&mdash;Of the&s;e, none equals the Andes in height; although Mount
Cauca&s;us, which is the highe&s;t of them, makes very near approaches. Father
Verbie&s;t tells of a moun|tain in China, which he mea&s;ured, and found a mile
and a half high<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Verbie&s;t, alla
Chine.</BIBL></NOTE>. In Africa, the moun|tains of the Moon, famous for giving
&s;ource to the Niger, and the Nile, are rather more noted than known. Of the
Pike of Teneriffe, one of the Canary I&s;lands that lie off this coa&s;t, we
have more certain information. In the year 1727, it was vi&s;ited by a company
of Engli&s;h merchants, who travelled up to the top, where they ob&s;erved its
height, and the volcano on its very &s;ummit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. They found it an heap
of mountains, the highe&s;t of which ri&s;es over the re&s;t like a
&s;ugar-loaf, and gives a name to the whole ma&s;s. It is computed to be a mile
and an half perpendicular from the &s;urface of the <PB N="154" REF="177">
&s;ea. Kircher gives us an e&s;timate of the heights of mo&s;t of the other
great mountains in the world; but as he has taken his calcu|lations, in
general, from the ancients, or from modern travellers, who had not the art of
mea|&s;uring them, they are quite incredible. The art of taking the heights of
places by the baro|meter, is a new, and an ingenious invention. As the air
grows lighter as we a&s;cend, the fluid in the tube ri&s;es in due proportion:
thus the in&s;trument being properly marked, gives the height with a tolerable
degree of exactne&s;s; at lea&s;t enough to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Few of our great mountains have been e&s;ti|mated in this manner;
travellers having, per|haps, been deterred, by a &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;ibility
of breathing at the top. However, it has been invariably found, that the air in
the highe&s;t that our modern travellers have a&s;cended, is not at all too
fine for re&s;piration. At the top of the Pike of Teneriff, there was found no
other incon|venience from the air, except its coldne&s;s; at the top of the
Andes, there was no difficulty of breathing perceived. The accounts, therefore,
of tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;erted that they were un|able to breathe, although at
much le&s;s heights, are greatly to be &s;u&s;pected. In fact, it is very
natural for mankind to paint tho&s;e ob&s;tacles as <PB N="155" REF="178">
in&s;urmountable, which they them&s;elves have not had the fortitude or
per&s;everance to &s;ur|mount.</P>
<P>The difficulty and danger of a&s;cending to the tops of mountains,
proceeds from other cau&s;es, not the thinne&s;s of the air. For in|&s;tance,
&s;ome of the &s;ummits of the Alps have never yet been vi&s;ited by man. But
the rea&s;on is, that they ri&s;e with &s;uch a rugged and pre|cipitate
a&s;cent, that they are utterly inacce&s;&s;ible. In &s;ome places they appear
like a great wall of &s;ix or &s;even hundred feet high; in others, there
&s;tick out enormous rocks, that hang upon the brow of the &s;teep, and every
moment threaten de&s;truction to the traveller below.</P>
<P>In this manner almo&s;t all the tops of the highe&s;t mountains are
bare and pointed. And this naturally proceeds from their being &s;o
con|tinually a&s;&s;aulted by thunders and tempe&s;ts. All the earthy
&s;ub&s;tances with which they might have been once covered, have for ages been
wa&s;hed away from their &s;ummits; and nothing is left remaining, but
immen&s;e rocks, which no tem|pe&s;t has hitherto been able to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, time is every day, and every hour, making
depredations; and huge frag|ments are &s;een tumbling down the precipice,
either loo&s;ened from the &s;ummit by fro&s;t or <PB N="156" REF="179"> rains,
or &s;truck down by lightening. Nothing can exhibit a more terrible picture
than one of the&s;e enormous rocks, commonly larger than an hou&s;e, falling
from its height, with a noi&s;e louder than thunder, and rolling down the
&s;ide of the mountain. Doctor Plot tells us of one in particular, which being
loo&s;ened from its bed, tumbled down the precipice, and was partly &s;hattered
into a thou&s;and pieces. Not|with&s;tanding, one of the large&s;t fragments of
the &s;ame, &s;till pre&s;erving its motion, travelled over the plain below,
cro&s;&s;ed a rivulet in the mid&s;t, and at la&s;t &s;topped on the other
&s;ide of the bank! The&s;e fragments, as was &s;aid, are often &s;truck off by
lightening, and &s;ometimes undermined by rains; but the mo&s;t u&s;ual manner
in which they are di&s;united from the mountain, is by fro&s;t: the rains
in&s;inuating between the inter&s;tices of the mountain, continue there until
there comes a fro&s;t, and then, when converted into ice, the water &s;wells
with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, and pro|duces the &s;ame effect as gun-powder,
&s;plitting the mo&s;t &s;olid rocks, and thus &s;hattering the &s;ummits of
the mountain.</P>
<P>But not rocks alone, but whole mountains are, by various cau&s;es,
di&s;united from each other. We &s;ee, in many parts of the Alps, 
<PB N="157" REF="180"> amazing clefts, the &s;ides of which &s;o exactly
corre&s;pond with the oppo&s;ite, that no doubt can be made of their having
been once joined together. At Cajeta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 364.</BIBL></NOTE>, in Italy, a mountain was &s;plit in this manner by
an earthquake; and there is a pa&s;&s;age opened through it, that appears as if
elaborately done by the indu&s;try of man. In the Andes the&s;e breaches are
frequently &s;een. That at Thermopyle, in Greece, has been long famous. The
mountain of the Troglodytes, in Arabia, has thus a pa&s;&s;age through it: and
that in Savoy, which Nature began, and which Victor Amadeus com|pleted, is an
in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>We have accounts of &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;rup|tions, immediately
after their happening. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the month of June<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t de l' Accademie des Sciences, p. 4, an.
1715.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the year 1714, a part of the mountain of Diableret, in
the di&s;trict of Valais, in France, &s;uddenly fell down, be|tween two and
three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather being very calm and &s;erene. It
was of a conical figure, and de&s;troyed fifty-five cottages in the fall.
Fifteen per&s;ons, to|gether with about an hundred bea&s;ts, were al&s;o
cru&s;hed beneath its ruins, which covered an extent of a good league &s;quare.
The du&s;t it occa&s;ioned, in&s;tantly covered all the neighbour|hood 
<PB N="158" REF="181"> in darkne&s;s. The heaps of rubbi&s;h were more than
three hundred feet high. They &s;topped the current of a river that ran along
the plain, which now is formed into &s;everal new and deep lakes. There
appeared, through the whole of this rubbi&s;h, none of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances
that &s;eemed to indicate that this di&s;ruption had been made by means of
&s;ubterraneous fires. Mo&s;t probably, the ba&s;e of this rocky mountain was
rotted and decayed; and thus fell, without any extraneous violence."</Q> In the
&s;ame manner, in the year 1618, the town of Pleurs, in France, was buried
beneath a rocky mountain, at the foot of which it was &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The&s;e accidents, and many more that might be enumerated of the
&s;ame kind, have been pro|duced by various cau&s;es: by earthquakes, as in the
mountain at Cajeta; or by being decayed at the bottom, as at Diableret. But the
mo&s;t gene|ral way is, by the foundation of one part of the mountain being
hollowed by waters and, thus wanting a &s;upport, breaking from the other. Thus
it generally has been found in the great cha&s;ms in the Alps; and thus it
almo&s;t always is known in tho&s;e di&s;ruptions of hills, which are known by
the name of land-&s;lips. The&s;e are nothing more than the &s;liding down of
an higher piece of ground, di&s;rooted from its <PB N="159" REF="182">
&s;ituation by &s;ubterraneous inundations, and &s;ettling it&s;elf upon the
plain below.</P>
<P>There is not an appearance in all nature that &s;o much
a&s;toni&s;hed our ance&s;tors, as the&s;e land|&s;lips. In fact, to behold a
large upland, with its hou&s;es, its corn, and cattle, at once loo&s;ened from
its place, and floating, as it were, upon the &s;ubjacent water; to behold it
quitting its ancient &s;ituation, and travelling forward like a &s;hip, in
que&s;t of new adventures; this is cer|tainly one of the mo&s;t extraordinary
appear|ances that can be imagined; and to a people, ignorant of the powers of
Nature, might well be con&s;idered as a prodigy. Accordingly, we find all our
old hi&s;torians mentioning it as an omen of approaching calamities. In this
more enlightened age, however, its cau&s;e is very well known; and, in&s;tead
of exciting ominous appre|hen&s;ions in the populace, it only gives ri&s;e to
&s;ome very ridiculous law-&s;uits among them, about who&s;e the property
&s;hall be; whether the land which has thus &s;lipt, &s;hall belong to the
original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or to him upon who&s;e grounds it has encroached
and &s;ettled. What has been the determination of the judges, is not &s;o well
known; but the circum&s;tances of the &s;lips them&s;elves have been minutely
enough, and exactly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="183">In the lands of Slatberg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. iv. p. 250.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the
kingdom of Ireland, there &s;tood a declivity, gradually a&s;cending for near
half a mile. In the year 1713, and on the 10th of March, the inhabi|tants
perceived a crack on its &s;ide, &s;omewhat like a furrow made with a plough,
which they imputed to the effects of lightening, as there had been thunder the
night before. However, on the evening of the &s;ame day, they were &s;ur|prized
to hear an hideous confu&s;ed noi&s;e i&s;&s;uing all round from the &s;ide of
the hill; and their curio&s;ity being rai&s;ed, they re&s;orted to the place.
There, to their amazement, they found the earth, for near five acres, all in
gentle motion, and &s;liding down the hill upon the &s;ubjacent plain. This
motion continued the remaining part of the day, and the whole night; nor did
the noi&s;e cea&s;e during the whole time; pro|ceeding, probably, from the
attrition of the ground beneath. The day following, however, this &s;trange
journey down the hill cea&s;ed en|tirely; and above an acre of the meadow
below, was found covered with what before compo&s;ed a part of the
declivity.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e &s;lips, when a whole moun|tain's &s;ide &s;eems to
de&s;cend, happen but very rarely. There are &s;ome of another kind, 
<PB N="161" REF="184"> ever, much more common; and, as they are always
&s;udden, much more dangerous. The&s;e are &s;now-&s;lips, well known, and
greatly dreaded by travellers. It often happens, that when &s;now has long been
accumulated on the tops and on the &s;ides of mountains, it is borne down the
precipice, either by means of tempe&s;ts, or its own melting. At fir&s;t, when
loo&s;ened, the volume in motion is but &s;mall; but it gathers as it continues
to roll; and, by the time it has reached the habitable parts of the mountain,
it is generally grown of enormous bulk. Where|ever it rolls, it levels all
things in its way; or buries them in unavoidable de&s;truction. In|&s;tead of
rolling, it &s;ometimes is found to &s;lide along from the top; yet even thus
it is gene|rally as fatal as before. Neverthele&s;s, we have had an in&s;tance,
a few years ago, of a &s;mall fa|mily in Germany, that lived for above a
fort|night beneath one of the&s;e &s;now-&s;lips. Altho' they were buried,
during that whole time, in utter darkne&s;s, and under a bed of &s;ome hun|dred
feet deep, yet they were luckily taken out alive; the weight of the &s;now
being &s;upported by a beam that kept up the roof; and nouri&s;h|ment being
&s;upplied them by the milk of an a&s;s, if I remember right, that was buried
under the &s;ame ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="185">But it is not the parts, alone, that are thus
found to &s;ub&s;ide, whole mountains have been known totally to di&s;appear.
Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. I, 2, cap. 93.</BIBL></NOTE> tells
us, that in his own time, the lofty mountain of Cy|botus, together with the
city of Eurites, were &s;wallowed by an earthquake. The &s;ame fate, he &s;ays,
attended Phlegium, one of the highe&s;t mountains in Aethiopia; which, after
one night's concu&s;&s;ion, was never &s;een more. In more modern times, a very
noted mountain in the Molucca i&s;lands, known by the name of the Peak, and
remarkable for being &s;een at a very great di&s;tance from &s;ea, was
&s;wallowed by an earthquake; and nothing but a lake was left in the place
where it &s;tood. Thus, while &s;torms and tempe&s;ts are levelled again&s;t
mountains above, earthquakes and waters are undermining them below. All our
hi&s;tories talk of their de&s;truction; and very few new ones (if we except
Mount Cenere, and one or two &s;uch heaps of cinders) are produced. If
moun|tains, therefore, were of &s;uch great utility as &s;ome philo&s;ophers
make them to mankind, it would be a very melancholy con&s;ideration that &s;uch
benefits were dimini&s;hing every day. But the truth is, the valleys are
fertilized by that earth which is wa&s;hed from their &s;ides;

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Water.</HEAD>
<P>IN contemplating nature, we &s;hall often find the &s;ame
&s;ub&s;tances po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of contrary qua|lities, and producing
oppo&s;ite effects. Air, which liquifies one &s;ub&s;tance, dries up another.
That fire which is &s;een to burn up the de&s;art, is often found, in other
places, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the lux|uriance of vegetation; and water, which, next
to fire, is the mo&s;t fluid &s;ub&s;tance upon earth, neverthele&s;s, gives
all other bodies their firm|ne&s;s and durability; &s;o that every element
&s;eems to be a powerful &s;ervant, capable either of good or ill, and only
awaiting external direction, to become the friend or the enemy of mankind.
The&s;e oppo&s;ite qualities, in this &s;ub&s;tance in particular, have not
failed to excite the admi|ration and enquiry of the curious.</P>
<P>That water is the mo&s;t fluid penetrating body, next to fire, and
the mo&s;t difficult to confine, is inconte&s;tibly proved by a variety of
experi|ments. A ve&s;&s;el through which water cannot pa&s;s, may be &s;aid to
retain any thing. It may <PB N="164" REF="187"> be objected, indeed, that
&s;yrups, oils, and ho|ney, leak through &s;ome ve&s;&s;els that water can|not
pa&s;s through; but this is far from being the re&s;ult of the greater tenuity
and finene&s;s of their parts; it is owing to the ro&s;in wherewith the wood of
&s;uch ve&s;&s;els abounds, which oils and &s;yrups have a power of
di&s;&s;olving; &s;o that the&s;e fluids, in&s;tead of finding their way, may
more properly be &s;aid to eat their way through the ve&s;&s;els that contain
them. However, water will at la&s;t find its way even through the&s;e; for it
is known to e&s;cape through ve&s;&s;els of every &s;ub&s;tance, gla&s;s only
excepted. Other bodies may be found to make their way out more readily indeed;
as air, when it finds a vent, will e&s;cape at once; and quick&s;ilver,
becau&s;e of its weight, quickly penetrates through what|ever chinky ve&s;&s;el
confines it: but water, tho' it operates more &s;lowly, yet always finds a more
certain i&s;&s;ue. As, for in&s;tance, it is well known that air will not
pa&s;s through leather; which water will very readily penetrate. Air al&s;o may
be retained in a bladder; but water will quickly ooze through. And tho&s;e who
drive this to the greate&s;t degree of preci&s;ion, pretend to &s;ay, that it
will pa&s;s through pores ten times &s;maller than air can do. Be this as it
may, we are very certain that its parts are &s;o &s;mall that they have 
<PB N="165" REF="188"> been actually driven through the pores of gold. This has
been proved by the famous Florentine experiment, in which a quantity of water
was &s;hut up in an hollow ball of gold, and then pre&s;&s;ed with an huge
force by &s;crews, during which the fluid was &s;een to ooze out through the
pores of the metal, and to &s;tand, like a dew, upon its &s;urface.</P>
<P>As water is thus penetrating, and its parts thus minute, it may
ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that they enter into the compo&s;ition of all bodies,
both vegetable, animal, and fo&s;&s;il. This every che|mi&s;t's experience
convinces him of; and the mixture is the more obvious, as it can always be
&s;eparated, by a gentle heat, from tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances with which it had
been united. Fire, as was &s;aid, will penetrate where water cannot pa&s;s; but
then it is not &s;o ea&s;ily to be &s;eparated. But there is &s;carce any
&s;ub&s;tance from which its water cannot be divorced. The parings or filings
of lead, tin, and antimony, by di&s;tillation, yield water plentifully: the
harde&s;t &s;tones, &s;ea &s;alt, nitre, vitriol, and &s;ulphur, are found to
con&s;i&s;t chiefly of water; into which they re&s;olve by force of fire. 
<Q REND="inline">"All birds, bea&s;ts, and fi&s;hes," &s;ays Newton,
"in&s;ects, trees, and vegetables, with their parts, grow from water; and, by
pu|trefaction, return to water again."</Q> In &s;hort, <PB N="166" REF="189">
almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;tance that we &s;ee, owes its texture and firmne&s;s to
the parts of water that mix with its earth; and, deprived of this fluid, it
falls away, into a ma&s;s of &s;hapele&s;s du&s;t and a&s;hes.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ee, as was above hinted, that this mo&s;t fluid
body, when mixed with others, gives them con&s;i&s;tence and form. Water, by
being mixed with earth or a&s;hes, and formed into a ve&s;&s;el, when baked
before the fire, be|comes a copel, remarkable for this, that it will bear the
utmo&s;t force of the hotte&s;t furnace that art can contrive. So the Chine&s;e
earth, of which porcelane is made, is nothing more than an artificial
compo&s;ition of earth and water, united by heat; and which a greater degree of
heat could ea&s;ily &s;eparate. Thus we &s;ee a body, extremely fluid of
it&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;|&s;uming a new nature, by being united with
others; we &s;ee a body, who&s;e fluid and di&s;&s;olv|ing qualities are &s;o
obvious, giving con&s;i&s;t|ence and hardne&s;s to all the &s;ub&s;tances of
the earth.</P>
<P>From con&s;iderations of this kind, Thales, and many of the ancient
philo&s;ophers, held that all things were made of water. In order to confirm
this opinion, Helmont made an expe|riment, by dive&s;ting a quantity of earth
of all its oils and &s;alts, and then putting this earth, <PB N="167" REF="190"> &s;o prepared, into an earthen pot, which nothing but rain-water
could enter, and planting a wil|low therein; this vegetable, &s;o planted, grew
up to a con&s;iderable heighth and bulk, merely from the accidental
a&s;per&s;ion of rain-water; while the earth in which it was planted, re|ceived
no &s;en&s;ible dimunition. From this ex|periment, he concluded, that water was
the only nouri&s;hment of the vegetable tribe; and that vegetables, being the
nouri&s;hment of animals, all organized &s;ub&s;tances, therefore, owed their
&s;upport and being only to water. But this has been &s;aid by Woodward to be
all a mi&s;take: for he &s;hews, that water being impregnated with earthy
particles, is only the conveyer of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances into the pores of
vegetables, rather than an encrea&s;er of them, by its own bulk: he &s;hews,
that water is ever found to afford &s;o much le&s;s nouri&s;hment, in
proportion as it is purified by di&s;tillation. A plant in di&s;tilled water
will not grow &s;o fa&s;t as in water not di&s;tilled: and if the &s;ame be
di&s;tilled three or four times over, the plant will &s;carce grow at all, or
receive any nouri&s;hment from it. So that water, as &s;uch, does not &s;eem
the proper and only nouri&s;hment of vegetables, but only the vehicle thereof,
which contains the nutritious particles, and car|ries them through all parts of
the plant. Water, <PB N="168" REF="191"> in its pure &s;tate, may &s;uffice to
extend or &s;well the parts of a plant, but affords vegetable mat|ter in a
moderate proportion.</P>
<P>However this be, it is agreed on all &s;ides, that water, &s;uch as
we find it, is far from being a pure &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance. The mo&s;t
genuine, we know, is mixed with exhalations and di&s;&s;o|lutions of various
kinds; and no expedient that has been hitherto di&s;covered, is capable of
purifying it entirely. If we filter and di&s;till it a thou&s;and times,
according to Boerhaave, it will &s;till depo&s;e a &s;ediment: and by repeating
the proce&s;s, we may evaporate it entirely away, but can never totally remove
its impurities. Some, however, a&s;&s;ert, that water, properly di&s;tilled,
will have no &s;ediment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hill's Hi&s;tory of
Fo&s;&s;ils.</BIBL></NOTE>; and that the little white &s;peck which is found at
the bottom of the &s;till, is a &s;ub&s;tance that enters from without. Kircher
u&s;ed to &s;hew, in his Mu&s;aeum, a phial of water, that had been kept for
fifty years, hermetically &s;ealed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hermetically
&s;ealing a gla&s;s-ve&s;&s;el, means no more than heating the mouth of the

mouth together with a pair of pincers, and then twi&s;ting it &s;ix or &s;even
times round, which effectually clo&s;es it up.</NOTE>; during which time it
depo&s;ed no &s;ediment, but continued as tran&s;|parent <PB N="169" REF="192">
as when fir&s;t it was put in. How far, therefore, it may be brought to a
&s;tate of pu|rity by di&s;tillation, is unknown; but we very well know, that
all &s;uch water as we every where &s;ee, is a bed in which plants, minerals,
and animals, are all found confu&s;edly floating together.</P>
<P>Rain-water, which is a fluid of Nature's own di&s;tilling, and which
has been rai&s;ed &s;o high by evaporation, is, neverthele&s;s, a very mixed
and impure &s;ub&s;tance. Exhalations of all kinds, whether &s;alts,
&s;ulphurs, or metals, make a part of its &s;ub&s;tance, and tend to increa&s;e
its weight. If we gather the water that falls, after a thun|der-clap, in a
&s;ultry &s;ummer's day, and let it &s;ettle, we &s;hall find a real &s;alt
&s;ticking at the bottom. In winter, however, its impure mix|tures are fewer;
but &s;till may be &s;eparated by di&s;tillation. But as to that which is
generally caught pouring from the tops of hou&s;es, it is particularly foul,
being impregnated with the &s;moak of the chimnies, the vapour of the &s;lates
or tiles, and with other impurities that birds and animals may have depo&s;ited
there. Be&s;ides, though it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed free from all the&s;e, it
is mixed with a quantity of air, which, after being kept for &s;ome time, will
be &s;een to &s;e|parate.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="193">Spring-water is next in point of purity. This,
according to Doctor Halley, is collected from the air it&s;elf; which being
&s;ated with water, and coming to be conden&s;ed by the evening's cold, is
driven again&s;t the tops of the moun|tains, where being conden&s;ed, and
collected, it trickles down by the &s;ides, into the cavities of the earth; and
running for a while under|ground, bubbles up in fountains upon the plain. This
having made but a &s;hort cir|culation, has generally had no long time to
di&s;&s;olve or imbibe any foreign &s;ub&s;tances by the way.</P>
<P>River-water is generally more foul than the former. Wherever the
&s;tream flows, it receives a tincture from its channel. Plants, minerals, and
animals, all contribute their &s;hare to add to its impurities: &s;o that
&s;uch as live at the mouths of great rivers, generally are &s;ubject to all
tho&s;e di&s;orders which contaminated and unwhol&s;ome waters are known to
produce. Of all the river|water in the world, that of the Indus, and the
Thames, are &s;aid to be mo&s;t light and whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>The impure&s;t fre&s;h water that we know, is that of &s;tagnating
pools and lakes, which, in &s;ummer, may be more properly con&s;idered as a
jelly of floating in&s;ects, than a collection of <PB N="171" REF="194"> water.
In this, millions of little reptiles, un|di&s;turbed by any current, which
might cru&s;h their frames to pieces, breed and engender. The whole teems with
&s;hapele&s;s life; and only grows more fruitful by encrea&s;ing
putrefaction.</P>
<P>Of the purity of all the&s;e waters, the light|ne&s;s, and not the
tran&s;parency, ought to be the te&s;t. Water may be extremely clear and
beau|tiful to the eye, and yet very much impregnated with mineral principles.
In fact, &s;ea-water is the mo&s;t tran&s;parent of any, and yet is well known
to contain a large mixture of &s;alt and bitumen. On the contrary, tho&s;e
waters which are lighte&s;t, have the fewe&s;t di&s;&s;olutions float|ing in
them; and may, therefore, be the mo&s;t u&s;eful for all the purpo&s;es of
life. But, after all, though much has been &s;aid upon this &s;ub|ject, and
although waters have been weighed with great a&s;&s;iduity, to determine their
degree of &s;alubrity, yet neither this, nor their curdling with &s;oap, nor
any other philo&s;ophical &s;tandard what&s;oever, will an&s;wer the purpo&s;es
of true in|formation. Experience alone ought to deter|mine the u&s;eful, or
noxious qualities, of every &s;pring; and experience a&s;&s;ures us, that
dif|ferent kinds of water are adapted to different con&s;titutions. An
inconte&s;tible proof of this, are the many medicinal &s;prings throughout the 
<PB N="172" REF="195"> world, who&s;e peculiar benefits are known to the
natives of their re&s;pective countries. The&s;e are of various kinds,
according to the different minerals with which they are impregnated; hot,
&s;aline, &s;ulphureous, bituminous, and oily. But the account of the&s;e will
come mo&s;t properly under that of the &s;everal minerals by which they are
produced.</P>
<P>After all, therefore, we mu&s;t be contented with but an impure
mixture for our daily be|verage. And yet, perhaps, this very mixture may often
be more &s;erviceable to our health than that of a purer kind. We know that it
is &s;o with regard to vegetables: and why not, al&s;o, in general, to man? Be
this as it will, if we are de&s;irous of having water in its greate&s;t purity,
we are ordered, by the curious in this particular, to di&s;till it from &s;now,
gathered upon the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, and to take none but the
outer and &s;uperficial part thereof. This we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to call
pure water; but even this is far &s;hort of the pure unmixed philo&s;o|phical
element; which, in reality, is no where to be found.</P>
<P>As water is thus mixed with foreign matter, and often the
repo&s;itory of minute animals, or vegetable &s;eeds, we need not be
&s;urprized that, when carried to &s;ea, it is always found to pu|trefy. 
<PB N="173" REF="196"> But we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that it is the element
it&s;elf, which thus grows putrid, and offen&s;ive, but the &s;ub&s;tances with
which it is impregnated. It is true, the utmo&s;t precau|tions are taken to
de&s;troy all vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances that may have previou&s;ly
been lodged in it, by boiling: but, notwith&s;tand|ing this, there are &s;ome
that will &s;till &s;urvive the operation; and others, that find their way
during the time of its &s;towage. Seamen, there|fore, a&s;&s;ure us, that their
water is generally found to putrefy twice, at lea&s;t, and &s;ometimes three
times, in a long voyage. In about a month after it has been at &s;ea, when the
bung is taken out of the ca&s;k, it &s;ends up a noi&s;ome and dangerous
vapour, which would take fire upon the application of a candle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. v. part ii. p. 71.</BIBL></NOTE>.
The whole body of the water then is found replete with little worm-like
in&s;ects, that float, with great bri&s;kne&s;s, through all its parts. The&s;e
gene|rally live for about a couple of days; and then dying, by depo&s;iting
their &s;poils, for a while encrea&s;e the putrefaction. After a time, the
heavier parts of the&s;e &s;inking to the bottom, the lighter float, in a
&s;cum, at the top; and this is what the mariners call, the water's purg|ing
it&s;elf. There are &s;till, however, another <PB N="174" REF="197"> race of
in&s;ects, which are bred, very probably, from the &s;poils of the former; and
produce, after &s;ome time, &s;imilar appearances: the&s;e dying, the water is
then thought to change no more. However, it very often happens, e&s;pe|cially
in hot climates, that nothing can drive the&s;e nau&s;eous in&s;ects from the
&s;hip's &s;tore of water. They often encrea&s;e to a very di&s;agree|able and
frightful &s;ize, &s;o as to deter the ma|riner, though parching with thir&s;t,
from ta&s;ting that cup which they have contaminated.</P>
<P>This water, as thus de&s;cribed, therefore, is a very different
fluid from that &s;imple elementary &s;ub&s;tance upon which philo&s;ophical
theories have been founded; and concerning the nature of which there have been
&s;o many di&s;putes. Elementary water is no way compounded; but is without
ta&s;te, &s;mell, or colour; and incapable of being di&s;cerned by any of the
&s;en&s;es, except the touch. This is the famous di&s;&s;olvent of the
chymi&s;ts, into which, as they have boa&s;ted, they can reduce all bodies; and
which makes up all other &s;ub&s;tances, only by putting on a different
di&s;gui&s;e. In &s;ome forms, it is fluid, tran&s;parent, and eva&s;ive of the
touch; in others, hard, firm, and ela&s;tic. In &s;ome, it is &s;tiffened by
cold; in others, di&s;&s;olved by fire. Accord-to them, it only a&s;&s;umes
external &s;hapes from <PB N="175" REF="198"> accidental cau&s;es; but the
mountain is as much a body of water as the cake of ice that melts on its brow;
and even the philo&s;opher him&s;elf, is compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials
with the cloud or meteor which he contemplates.</P>
<P>Speculation &s;eldom re&s;ts when it begins. Others, di&s;allowing
the univer&s;ality of this &s;ub|&s;tance, will not allow that in a &s;tate of
nature there is any &s;uch thing as water at all. What a&s;&s;umes the
appearance, &s;ay they, is nothing more than melted ice. Ice is the real
element of Nature's making; and when found in a &s;tate of fluidity, it is then
in a &s;tate of violence. All &s;ub&s;tances are naturally hard; but &s;ome
more readily melt with heat than others. It requires a great heat to melt iron;
a &s;maller heat will melt copper: &s;ilver, gold, tin, and lead, melt with
&s;maller &s;till: ice, which is a body like the re&s;t, melts with a very
moderate warmth; and quick&s;ilver, melts with the &s;malle&s;t warmth of all.
Water, therefore, is but ice kept in con|tinual fu&s;ion; and &s;till returning
to its former &s;tate, when the heat is taken away. Between the&s;e oppo&s;ite
opinions, the controver&s;y has been carried on with great ardour; and much has
been written on both &s;ides: and yet, when we come to examine the debate, it
will probably terminate in this que&s;tion, whether cold or heat 
<PB N="176" REF="199"> fir&s;t began their operations upon water? This is a
fact of very little importance, if known; and what is more, it is a fact we can
never know.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine into the operations of cold and heat upon
water, we &s;hall find that they produce &s;omewhat &s;imilar effects. Water
dilates in its bulk, by heat, to a very con&s;ider|able degree; and, what is
more extraordinary, it is likewi&s;e dilated by cold, in the &s;ame
man|ner.</P>
<P>If water be placed over a fire, it grows gra|dually larger in bulk,
as it becomes hot, until it begins to boil; after which, no art can either
encrea&s;e its bulk, or its heat. By encrea&s;ing the fire, indeed, it may be
more quickly evaporated away; but its heat, and its bulk, &s;till continue the
&s;ame. By the expanding of this fluid by heat, philo&s;ophers have found a way
to deter|mine the warmth, or the coldne&s;s of other bo|dies: for if put into a
gla&s;s tube, by its &s;welling and ri&s;ing therein, it &s;hews the quantity
of heat in the body to which it is applied; by its con|tracting, and &s;inking,
it &s;hews the ab&s;ence of the &s;ame. In&s;tead of u&s;ing water in this
in|&s;trument, which is called a thermometer, they now make u&s;e of &s;pirit
of wine, which is not apt to freeze, and which is endued even with a 
<PB N="177" REF="200"> greater expan&s;ion, by heat, than water. The
in&s;trument con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than a hol|low ball of gla&s;s, with
a long tube growing out of it. This being partly filled with &s;pirits of wine,
tinctured red, &s;o as to be &s;een when it ri&s;es, the ball is plunged into
boiling water, which making the &s;pirit within expand and ri&s;e in the tube,
the water marks the greate&s;t height to which it a&s;cends; at this point the
tube is to be broken off, and then hermetically &s;ealed, by melt|ing the
gla&s;s with a blow-pipe: a &s;cale being placed by the &s;ide, completes the
thermometer. Now as the fluid expands or conden&s;es with heat or cold, it will
ri&s;e and fall in the tube in proportion; and the degree or quantity of
a&s;cent or de&s;cent will be &s;een in the &s;cale.</P>
<P>No fire, as was &s;aid, can make water hotter, after it begins to
boil. We can, therefore, at any time be &s;ure of an equable certain heat;
which is that of boiling water, which is invariably the &s;ame. The certainty
of &s;uch an heat is not le&s;s u&s;eful than the in&s;trument that mea&s;ures
it. It affords a &s;tandard, fixed, degree of heat over the whole world;
boiling water being as hot in Greenland, as upon the coa&s;ts of Guinea. One
fire is more inten&s;e than another; of heat there are various degrees; but
boiling water is an heat every where the &s;ame, and ea&s;ily procurable.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="201">As heat thus expands water, &s;o cold, when it
is violent enough to freeze the &s;ame, produces exactly the &s;ame effect, and
expands it likewi&s;e. Thus water is acted upon in the &s;ame manner by two
oppo&s;ite qualities; being dilated by both. As a proof that it is dilated by
cold, we have only to ob&s;erve the ice which floats on the &s;urface of a
pond, which it would not do were it not dilated, and grown more bulky, by
freez|ing, than the water, which remains unfroze. Mr. Boyle, however, put the
matter pa&s;t a doubt, by a variety of experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. i. p. 610.</BIBL></NOTE>. Having poured a proper
quantity of water into a &s;trong earthen ve&s;&s;el, he expo&s;ed it,
uncovered, to the open air, in fro&s;ty nights; and ob&s;erved, that
continually the ice reached higher than the water, before it was frozen. He
filled al&s;o a tube with water, and &s;topped both ends with wax: the water,
when froze, was found to pu&s;h out the &s;topples from both ends; and a rod of
ice appeared at each end of the tube, which &s;hewed how much it was &s;wollen
by the cold within.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, we may be very cer|tain of the cold's
dilating of the water; and ex|perience al&s;o &s;hews that, the force of this
ex|pan&s;ion has been found as great as any which <PB N="179" REF="202"> heat
has been found to produce. The touch|hole of a &s;trong gun-barrel being
&s;topped, and a plug of iron forcibly driven into the muzzle, after the barrel
had been filled with water, it was placed in a mixture of ice and &s;alt; the
plug, though &s;oldered to the barrel, at fir&s;t gave way, but being fixed in
more firmly, within a quarter of an hour the gun-barrel bur&s;t with a loud
noi&s;e, and blew up the cover of the box wherein it lay. Such is its force in
an or|dinary experiment. But it has been known to bur&s;t cannons, filled with
water, and then left to freeze; for the cold congealing the water, and the ice
&s;welling, it became irre&s;i&s;tible. The bur&s;ting of rocks, by fro&s;t,
which is frequent enough in the Northern climates, and is &s;ome|times &s;een
in our own, is an equal proof of the expan&s;ion of congealed water. For
having, by &s;ome means in&s;inuated it&s;elf into the body of the rock, it has
remained there till the cold was &s;ufficient to affect it by congelation. But
when once frozen, no ob&s;tacle is able to confine it from dilating; and, if it
cannot otherwi&s;e find room, the rock mu&s;t bur&s;t a&s;under.</P>
<P>This alteration in the bulk of water, might have &s;erved as a proof
that it was capable of being compre&s;&s;ed into a narrower &s;pace than it
occupied before; but, till of late, water was <PB N="180" REF="203"> held to be
incompre&s;&s;ible. The general opinion was, that no art what&s;oever could
&s;queeze it into a narrower compa&s;s; that no power on earth, for in&s;tance,
could cru&s;h a pint of water into a ve&s;&s;el that held an hair's breadth
le&s;s than a pint. And this, &s;aid they, appears from the fa|mous Florentine
experiment; where the water, rather than &s;uffer compre&s;&s;ure, was &s;een
to ooze out through the pores of the &s;olid metal; and, at length, making a
cleft in the &s;ide, &s;pun out with great vehemence. But later trials have
proved that water is very compre&s;&s;ible, and partakes of that ela&s;ticity
which every other body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;ome degree. Indeed, had not
mankind been dazzled by the brilliancy of one inconclu&s;ive experiment, there
were nu|merous rea&s;ons to convince them of its having the &s;ame properties
with other &s;ub&s;tances. Ice, which is water in another &s;tate, is very
ela&s;tic. A &s;tone flung &s;lantingly along the &s;urface of a pond, bounds
from the water &s;everal times; which &s;hews it to be ela&s;tic al&s;o. But
the trials of Mr. Canton have put this pa&s;t all doubt; which being &s;omewhat
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of the great Boyle, who pre&s;&s;ed it with weights
properly applied, carry &s;ufficient conviction.</P>
<P>What has been hitherto related, is chiefly applicable to the element
of water alone; but its &s;luidity is a property that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in
com|mon <PB N="181" REF="204"> with &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances, in other
re|&s;pects greatly differing from it. That quality which gives ri&s;e to the
definition of a fluid, namely, that its parts are in a continual in|te&s;tine
motion, &s;eems extremely applicable to water. What the &s;hapes of tho&s;e
parts are, it would be vain to attempt to di&s;cover. Every trial only &s;hews
the futility of the attempt; all we find is, that they are extremely minute;
and that they roll over each other with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. Some, indeed,
from this property alone, have not he&s;itated to pronounce them globular; and
we have, in all our hydro&s;tatical books, pictures of the&s;e little globes in
a &s;tate of &s;liding and rolling over each other. But all this is merely the
work of imagination; we know that &s;ub&s;tances of any kind, reduced very
&s;mall, a&s;&s;ume a fluid appearance, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of water.
Mr. Boyle, after finely powder|ing and &s;ifting a little dry powder of
plai&s;ter of Paris, put it in a ve&s;&s;el over the fire, where it &s;oon
began to boil like water, exhibiting all the motions and appearances of a
boiling liquor. Although but a powder, the parts of which we know are very
different from each other, and ju&s;t as accident has formed them, yet it
heaved in great waves, like water. Upon <PB N="182" REF="205"> agitation, an
heavy body will &s;ink to the bot|tom, and a light one emerge to the top. There
is no rea&s;on, therefore, to &s;uppo&s;e the figure of the parts of water
round, &s;ince we &s;ee their flu|idity very well imitated by a compo&s;ition,
the parts of which are of various forms and &s;izes. The &s;hape of the parts
of water, therefore, we mu&s;t be content to continue ignorant of. All we know
is, that earth, air, and fire, all conduce to &s;eparate the parts from each
other.</P>
<P>Earthy &s;ub&s;tances divide the parts from each other, and keep
them a&s;under. This divi&s;ion may be &s;o great, that the water will entirely
lo&s;e its fluidity thereby. Mud, potter's clay, and dried bricks, are but &s;o
many different combi|nations of earth and water; each &s;ub&s;tance in which
the parts of water are mo&s;t &s;eparated from each other, appearing to be the
mo&s;t dry. In &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances, indeed, where the parts of water are
greatly divided, as in porcelane, for in&s;tance, it is no ea&s;y matter to
recover and bring them together again; but they continue in a manner fixed and
united to the manu|factured clay. This circum&s;tance it was, which led Doctor
Cheney into a very peculiar &s;train of thinking. He &s;u&s;pected that the
quantity of water, on the &s;urface of the earth, was daily decrea&s;ing. For,
&s;ays he, &s;ome parts of it are <PB N="183" REF="206"> continually joined to
vegetable, animal, and mi|neral &s;ub&s;tances, which no art can again recover.
United with the&s;e, the water lo&s;es its fluidity; for if, continues he, we
&s;eparate a few particles of any fluid, and fa&s;ten them to a &s;olid body,
or keep them a&s;under, one from another, they will be fluid no longer. To
produce fluidity, a con|&s;iderable number of &s;uch particles are required;
but here they are clo&s;e, and de&s;titute of their natural properties. Thus,
according to him, the world is growing every day harder and harder, and the
earth firmer and firmer; and there may come a time when every object around us
may be &s;tiffened in univer&s;al frigidity! How|ever, we have cau&s;es enough
of anxiety in this world already, not to add this prepo&s;terous con|cern to
the number.</P>
<P>That air al&s;o contributes to divide the parts of water, we can
have no manner of doubt of; &s;ome have even di&s;puted whether water be not
capable of being turned into air. However, though this mu&s;t not be allowed,
it mu&s;t be granted, that it may be turned into a &s;ub&s;tance which greatly
re&s;embles air (as we have &s;een in the experiment of the oeolpile) with all
its pro|perties; except that, by cold, this new made air may be conden&s;ed
again into water.</P>
<P>But of all the &s;ub&s;tances which tend to divide 
<PB N="184" REF="207"> the parts of water, fire is the mo&s;t powerful. Water,
when heated into &s;team, acquires &s;uch force, and the parts of it tend to
fly off from each other with &s;uch violence, that no earthly &s;ub&s;tance we
know of, is &s;trong enough to con|fine them. A &s;ingle drop of water,
converted into &s;team, has been found capable of rai&s;ing a weight of twenty
tons; and would have rai&s;ed twenty thou&s;and, were the ve&s;&s;el confining
it &s;ufficiently &s;trong, and the fire below en|crea&s;ed in proportion.</P>
<P>From this ea&s;y yielding of its parts to external pre&s;&s;ure,
ari&s;es the art of determining the bulk of bodies by plunging them in water;
with all the other u&s;eful di&s;coveries in that part of na|tural
philo&s;ophy, called hydro&s;tatics. The laws of this &s;cience, which
Archimedes fir&s;t began, and Pa&s;cal, with &s;ome other of the moderns,
brought to perfection, rather belongs to ex|perimental than to natural
hi&s;tory. However, I will take leave to mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t
&s;triking paradoxes in this branch of &s;cience, which are as well confirmed
by experiment, as rendered univer&s;al by theory. It would, indeed, be
unpardonable, while di&s;cour&s;ing on the pro|perties of water, to omit giving
&s;ome account of the manner in which it &s;u&s;tains &s;uch immen&s;e bulks as
we &s;ee floating upon its &s;oft and yield|ing &s;urface: how &s;ome bodies,
that are known <PB N="185" REF="208"> to &s;ink at one time, &s;wim with
ea&s;e, if their &s;ur|face be enlarged: how the heavie&s;t body, even gold
it&s;elf, may be made to &s;wim upon water; and how the lighte&s;t, &s;uch as
cork, &s;hall remain &s;unk at the bottom: how the pouring in of a &s;ingle
quart of water, will bur&s;t an hog&s;head hooped with iron: and how it
a&s;cends, in pipes, from the valley, to travel over the mountain: the&s;e are
circum&s;tances that are at fir&s;t &s;urpriz|ing; but, upon a &s;light
con&s;ideration, lo&s;e their wonder.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the above &s;ketch, the manner of
demon&s;trating u&s;ed by Mon&s;ieur D'Alambert is made u&s;e of, as the mo&s;t
obvious, and the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory. 
<BIBL>Vide E&s;&s;ai &s;ur, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>In order to
conceive the manner in which all the&s;e wonders are effected, we mu&s;t begin
by ob&s;erving that water is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an invariable property, which
has not hitherto been mention|ed; that of always keeping its &s;urface level
and even. Winds, indeed, may rai&s;e it into waves; or art &s;purt it up in
fountains; but ever, when left to it&s;elf, it &s;inks into a &s;mooth even
&s;urface, of which no one part is higher than another. If I &s;hould pour
water, for in&s;tance, into the arm of a pipe of the &s;hape of the letter U,
the fluid would ri&s;e in the other arm ju&s;t to the &s;ame height; becau&s;e,
otherwi&s;e, it would not find its level, which it invariably maintains. A pipe
<PB N="186" REF="209"> bending from one hill down into the valley, and ri&s;ing
by another, may be con&s;idered as a tube of this kind, in which the water,
&s;inking in one arm, ri&s;es to maintain its level in the other. And upon this
principle all water-pipes depend; which can never rai&s;e the water higher than
the fountain from which they proceed.</P>
<P>Again, let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that the arms of the pipe
already mentioned, may be made long or &s;hort at plea&s;ure; and let us
&s;till further &s;uppo&s;e, that there is &s;ome ob&s;tacle at the bottom of
it, which prevents the water poured into one arm, from ri&s;ing in the other.
Now it is evident, that this ob&s;tacle at the bot|tom will &s;u&s;tain a
pre&s;&s;ure from the water in one arm, equal to what would make it ri&s;e in
the other; and this pre&s;&s;ure will be great, in pro|portion as the arm
filled with water is tall. We may, therefore, generally conclude, that the
bottom of every ve&s;&s;el is pre&s;&s;ed by a force, in proportion to the
height of the water in that ve&s;&s;el. For in&s;tance, if the ve&s;&s;el
filled with water be forty feet high, the bottom of that ve&s;&s;el will
&s;u&s;tain &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ure as would rai&s;e the &s;ame water forty feet
high, which is very great. From hence we &s;ee how extremely apt to bur&s;t our
pipes that convey water to the city are; for de&s;cending from an hill of more
than <PB N="187" REF="210"> forty feet high, they are pre&s;&s;ed by the water
contained in them, with a force equal to what would rai&s;e it more than forty
feet high; and that this is &s;ometimes able to bur&s;t a wooden pipe, we can
have no room to doubt of.</P>
<P>Still recurring to our pipe, let us &s;uppo&s;e one of its arms ten
times as thick as the other; this will produce no effect what&s;oever upon the
ob|&s;tacle below, which we &s;uppo&s;ed hindering its ri&s;e in the other arm;
becau&s;e, how thick &s;oever the pipe may be, its contents would only ri&s;e
to its own level; and it will, therefore, pre&s;s the ob&s;tacle with a force
equal thereto. We may, therefore, univer&s;ally conclude, that the bottom of
any ve&s;&s;el is pre&s;&s;ed by its water, not as it is broad or narrow, but
in proportion as it is high. Thus the water contained in a ve&s;&s;el not
thicker than my finger, pre&s;&s;es its bottom as forcibly as the water
contained in an hog&s;head of an equal height; and, if we made holes in the
bottoms of both, the water would bur&s;t out as forceful from the one as the
other. Hence we may, with great ea&s;e, bur&s;t an hog&s;head with a &s;ingle
quart of water; and it has been often done. We have only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Nollet's Lectures.</BIBL></NOTE>, for this, to place an
hog&s;head on one end, filled with water: we then bore an hole in its top, into
which we plant a narrow <PB N="188" REF="211"> tin pipe, of about thirty feet
high: by pouring a quart of water into this, at the top, as it con|tinues to
ri&s;e higher in the pipe, it will pre&s;s more forcibly on the bottom and
&s;ides of the hog&s;head below, and at la&s;t bur&s;t it.</P>
<P>Still returning to our &s;imple in&s;trument of demon&s;tration. If
we &s;uppo&s;e the ob&s;tacle at the bottom of the pipe to be moveable, &s;o as
that the force of the water can pu&s;h it up into the other arm; &s;uch a body
is quick&s;ilver, for in&s;tance. Now, it is evident, that the weight of water
weighing down upon this quick&s;ilver in one arm, will at la&s;t pre&s;s it up
in the other arm; and will continue to pre&s;s it upwards, until the fluid in
both arms be upon a par. So that here we actually &s;ee quick&s;ilver, the
heavie&s;t &s;ub&s;tance in the world, except gold, floating upon water, which
is but a very light &s;ub|&s;tance.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee water thus capable of &s;u&s;taining quick&s;ilver, we
need not be &s;urprized that it is capable of floating much lighter
&s;ub&s;tances, &s;hips, animals, or timber. When any thing floats upon water,
we always &s;ee that a part of it &s;inks in the &s;ame. A cork, a &s;hip, a
buoy, each buries it&s;elf a bed on the &s;urface of the water; this bed may be
con&s;idered as &s;o much water di&s;placed; the water will, therefore, lo&s;e 
<PB N="189" REF="212"> &s;o much of its own weight as is equal to the weight of
that bed of water which it di&s;places. If the body be heavier than a &s;imilar
bulk of water, it will &s;ink; if lighter, it will &s;wim. Univer&s;ally,
therefore, every body that is plunged in water, lo&s;es as much of its weight
as is equal to the weight of a body of water of its own bulk. Some light
bodies, therefore, &s;uch as cork, lo&s;e all their weight, and therefore
&s;wim, becau&s;e their bulk of water is heavier than they; other more
ponderous bodies &s;ink, becau&s;e they are heavier than their bulk of
water.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;imple theorem entirely depends the art of weighing
metals hydro&s;tatically. I have a guinea, for in&s;tance, and de&s;ire to know
whether it be pure gold: I have weighed it in the u&s;ual way with another
guinea, and find it exactly of the &s;ame weight, but &s;till I have &s;ome
&s;u&s;picion, from its greater bulk, that it is not pure. In order to
determine this, I have nothing more to do than to weigh it in water with that
&s;ame guinea that I know to be good, and of the &s;ame weight; and this will
in&s;tantly &s;hew the difference; for the true ponderous metal will &s;ink,
and the fal&s;e bulky one will be &s;u&s;tained in proportion to the
greatne&s;s of its &s;urface. Tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to examine the
purity of metals, have a balance made for this purpo&s;e, <PB N="190" REF="213"> by which they can preci&s;ely determine which is mo&s;t ponderous,
or, as it is expre&s;&s;ed, which has the greate&s;t &s;pecific gravity.
Seventy-one pound and an half of quick&s;ilver is found to be equal in bulk to
an hundred pound weight of gold. In the &s;ame proportion, &s;ixty of lead,
fifty-four of &s;ilver, forty-&s;even of copper, forty-five of bra&s;s,
forty-two of iron, and thirty-nine of tin, are each equal to an hundred pound
of the &s;ame mo&s;t ponderous of all metals.</P>
<P>This method of preci&s;ely determining the purity of gold, by
weighing in water, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Archimedes, to whom mankind have
been indebted for many of the mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;coveries. Hiero, king of
Sicily, having &s;ent a certain quantity of gold to be made into a crown, the
workman, it &s;eems, kept a part for his own u&s;e, and &s;upplied the
deficiency with a ba&s;er metal. His fraud was &s;u&s;pected by the king, but
could not be proved; till applying to Archimedes, he weighed the crown in
water; and, by this method, directly informed the king of the quantity of gold
which was taken away.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that all fluids endeavour to pre&s;erve their
level; and, likewi&s;e, that a body pre&s;&s;ing on the &s;urface, tended to
de&s;troy that level. From hence, therefore, it will ea&s;ily be 
<PB N="191" REF="214"> inferred, that the deeper any body &s;inks, the greater
will be the re&s;i&s;tance of the depre&s;&s;ed fluid beneath. It will be
a&s;ked, therefore, as the re&s;i&s;tance encrea&s;es in proportion as the body
de&s;cends, how comes the body, after it is got a certain way, to &s;ink at
all? The an&s;wer is ob|vious. From the fluid above it pre&s;&s;ing it down
with almo&s;t as great a force as the fluid beneath pre&s;&s;es it up. Take
away, by any art, the pre&s;&s;ure of the fluid from above, and let only the
re&s;i&s;tance of the fluid from below be &s;uffered to act, and after the body
is got down very deep, the re&s;i&s;tance will be in&s;uperable. To give an
in&s;tance: a &s;mall hole opens in the bottom of a &s;hip at &s;ea, forty feet
we will &s;uppo&s;e below the &s;urface of the water; through this the water
bur&s;ts up with great violence; I attempt to &s;top it with my hand, but it
pu&s;hes the hand violently away. Here the hand is, in fact, a body attempt|ing
to &s;ink upon water, at a depth of forty feet, with the pre&s;&s;ure from
above taken away. The water, therefore, will overcome my &s;trength; and will
continue to bur&s;t in till it has got to its level: if I &s;hould then dive
into the hold, and clap my hand upon the opening, as before, I &s;hould
perceive no force acting again&s;t my hand at all, for the water above
pre&s;&s;es the hand as much down again&s;t the hole, as the water without 
<PB N="192" REF="215"> pre&s;&s;es it upward. For this rea&s;on, al&s;o, when
we dive to the bottom of the water, we &s;u&s;tain a very great pre&s;&s;ure
from above, it is true, but it is counteracted by the pre&s;&s;ure from below;
and the whole acting uniformly on the &s;urface of the body, wraps us clo&s;e
round without in|jury.</P>
<P>As I have deviated thus far, I will ju&s;t men|tion one or two
properties more, which water, and all &s;uch like fluids, is found to
po&s;&s;e&s;s. And fir&s;t, their a&s;cending in ve&s;&s;els which are emptied
of air, as in our common pumps for in&s;tance. The air, however, being the
agent in this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t previou&s;ly examine the pro|perties of that,
before we undertake the expla|nation. The other property to be mentioned is,
that of their a&s;cending in &s;mall capillary tubes. This is one of the mo&s;t
extraordinary and in|&s;crutable appearances in nature. Gla&s;s tubes may be
drawn, by means of a lamp, as fine as an hair; &s;till pre&s;erving their
hollow within. If one of the&s;e be planted in a ve&s;&s;el of water, or
&s;pirit of wine, the liquor will immediately be &s;een to a&s;cend; and it
will ri&s;e higher, in pro|portion as the tube is &s;maller; a foot, two feet,
and more. How does this come to pa&s;s? Is the air the cau&s;e? No: the liquor
ri&s;es, although the air be taken away. Is attraction the cau&s;e? 
<PB N="193" REF="216"> No: for quick&s;ilver does not a&s;cend, which it
otherwi&s;e would. Many have been the theories of experimental philo&s;ophers
to explain this property. Such as are fond of travelling in the regions of
conjecture, may con&s;ult Hawk&s;bee, Morgan, Jurin, or Wat&s;on, who have
examined the &s;ubject with great minutene&s;s. Hitherto, however, nothing but
doubts in&s;tead of know|lege have been the re&s;ult of their enquiries. It
will not, therefore, become us to enter into the minutene&s;s of the enquiry,
when we have &s;o many greater wonders to call our attention away.</P>

can|not utter it. All rivers run into the &s;ea, yet the &s;ea is not full.
Unto the place whence the rivers come, thither they return again. The eye is
not &s;atisfied with &s;eeing, nor the ear with hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, chap. i. v. 5, 7, 8.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus
&s;peaks the wi&s;e&s;t of the Jews. <PB N="194" REF="217"> And, at &s;o early
a period was the curio&s;ity of man employed in ob&s;erving the&s;e great
circu|lations of nature. Every eye attempted to ex|plain tho&s;e appearances;
and every philo&s;opher who has long thought upon the &s;ubject, &s;eems to
give a peculiar &s;olution. The enquiry whence rivers are produced; whence they
derive tho&s;e uncea&s;ing &s;tores of water, which continually en|rich the
world with fertility and verdure; has been variou&s;ly con&s;idered; and
divided the opi|nions of mankind, more than any other topic in natural
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In this conte&s;t, the various champions may be cla&s;&s;ed under
two leaders, Mr. De La Hire, who contends that rivers mu&s;t be &s;upplied from
the &s;ea, &s;trained through the pores of the earth; and Doctor Halley, who
has endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that the clouds alone are &s;ufficient for
the &s;upply. Both &s;ides have brought in ma|thematics to their aid; and have
&s;hewn, that long and laborious calculations can at any time be made, to
ob&s;cure both &s;ides of a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>De La Hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. de l'Accad. 1713,
p. 56.</BIBL></NOTE> begins his proofs, that rain|water, evaporated from the
&s;ea, is in&s;ufficient for the production of rivers; by &s;hewing, that rain
never penetrates the &s;urface of the earth above &s;ixteen inches. From thence
he infers, <PB N="195" REF="218"> that it is impo&s;&s;ible for it, in many
ca&s;es, to &s;ink &s;o as to be found at &s;uch con&s;iderable depths below.
Rain-water, he grants, is often &s;een to mix with rivers, and to &s;well their
currents; but a much greater part of it evaporates away. In fact, continues he,
if we &s;uppo&s;e the earth every where covered with water, evaporation alone
would be &s;ufficient to carry off two feet nine inches of it in a year: and
yet, we very well know, that &s;carce nineteen inches of rain|water falls in
that time; &s;o that evaporation would carry off a much greater quantity than
is ever known to de&s;cend. The &s;mall quantity of rain-water that falls is
therefore but barely &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of vegetation. Two leaves
of a fig-tree have been found, by expe|riment, to imbibe from the earth, in
five hours and an half, two ounces of water. This im|plies the great quantity
of fluid that mu&s;t be exhau&s;ted in the maintainance of one &s;ingle plant.
Add to this, that the waters of the river Rungis will, by calculation, ri&s;e
to fifty inches; and the whole country from whence they are &s;upplied, never
receives fifty inches, in the year, by rain. Be&s;ides this, there are many
&s;alt &s;prings, which are known to proceed imme|diately from the &s;ea, and
are &s;ubject to its flux and reflux. In &s;hort, wherever we dig beneath 
<PB N="196" REF="219"> the &s;urface of the earth, except in a very few
in&s;tances, water is to be found; and it is by this &s;ubterraneous water,
that &s;prings and rivers, nay, a great part of vegetation it&s;elf, is
&s;up|ported. It is this &s;ubterraneous water, which is rai&s;ed into &s;team,
by the internal heat of the earth, that feeds plants. It is this
&s;ubterraneous water that di&s;tills through its inter&s;tices; and there
cooling, forms fountains. It is this that, by the addition of rains, is
encrea&s;ed into rivers; and pours plenty over the whole earth.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p. 128.</BIBL></NOTE>, it is
a&s;|&s;erted, that the vapours which are exhaled from the &s;ea, and driven by
the winds upon land, are more than &s;ufficient to &s;upply not only plants
with moi&s;ture, but al&s;o to furni&s;h a &s;ufficiency of water to the
greate&s;t rivers. For this pur|po&s;e, an e&s;timate has been made of the
quantity of water emptied at the mouths of the greate&s;t rivers; and of the
quantity al&s;o rai&s;ed from the &s;ea by evaporation; and it has been found,
that the latter by far exceeds the former. This calculation was made by Mr.
Mariotte. By him it was found, upon receiving &s;uch rain as fell in a year, in
a proper ve&s;&s;el, fitted for that purpo&s;e, that, one year with another,
there might fall about twenty inches of water upon <PB N="197" REF="220"> the
&s;urface of the earth, throughout Europe. It was al&s;o computed, that the
river Seine, from its &s;ource to the city of Paris, might cover an extent of
ground, that would &s;upply it annually with above &s;even billions of cubic
feet of this water, formed by evaporation. But, upon com|puting the quantity
which pa&s;&s;ed through the arches of one of its bridges in a year, it was
found to amount only to two hundred and eighty millions of cubic feet, which is
not above the &s;ixth part of the former number. Hence, therefore, it appears,
that this river may receive a &s;upply brought to it by the evaporated waters
of the &s;ea, &s;ix times greater than what it gives back to the &s;ea by its
current; and, therefore, evaporation is more than &s;ufficient for main|taining
the greate&s;t rivers; and &s;upplying the purpo&s;es al&s;o of vegetation.</P>
<P>In this manner the &s;ea &s;upplies &s;ufficient hu|midity to the
air for furni&s;hing the earth with all nece&s;&s;ary moi&s;ture. One part of
its vapours fall upon its own bo&s;om, before they arrive upon land. Another
part is arre&s;ted by the &s;ides of mountains, and is compelled, by the
ri&s;ing &s;tream of air, to mount upward towards the &s;ummits. Here it is
pre&s;ently precipitated, dripping down by the crannies of the &s;tone. In
&s;ome places, entering into the caverns of the <PB N="198" REF="221">
mountain, it gathers in tho&s;e receptacles, which being once filled, all the
re&s;t overflows; and breaking out by the &s;ides of the hills, forms &s;ingle
&s;prings. Many of the&s;e run down by the vallies, or guts between the ridges
of the mountain, and coming to unite, form little ri|vulets or brooks; many of
the&s;e meeting in one common valley, and gaining the plain ground, being grown
le&s;s rapid, become a river: and many of the&s;e uniting, make &s;uch va&s;t
bodies of water as the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Da|nube.</P>
<P>There is &s;till a third part, which falls upon the lower grounds,
and furni&s;hes plants with their wonted &s;upply. But the circulation does not
re&s;t even here; for it is again exhaled into vapour by the action of the
&s;un; and again re|turned to that great ma&s;s of waters whence it fir&s;t
aro&s;e. This, adds Doctor Halley, &s;eems the mo&s;t rea&s;onable
hypothe&s;is; and much more likely to be true, than that of tho&s;e who derive
all &s;prings from the filtering of the &s;ea waters through certain imaginary
tubes or pa&s;&s;ages within the earth; &s;ince it is well known, that the
greate&s;t rivers have their mo&s;t copious foun|tains the mo&s;t remote from
the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.

<P>This &s;eems the mo&s;t adopted opinion; and yet, after all, it is
&s;till pre&s;&s;ed with great diffi|culties; <PB N="199" REF="222"> and there
is &s;till room to look out for a better theory. The perpetuity of many
&s;prings, which always yield the &s;ame quantity when the lea&s;t rain or
vapour is afforded, as well as when the greate&s;t, is a &s;trong objection.

mentions a &s;pring at Upmin&s;ter, which he could never perceive by his eye to
be dimini&s;hed, in the greate&s;t droughts, even when all the ponds in the
country, as well as an ad|joining brook, have been dry for &s;everal months
together. In the rainy &s;ea&s;ons al&s;o, it was never overflowed; except
&s;ometimes, perhaps, for an hour or &s;o, upon the immi&s;&s;ion of the
external rains. He, therefore, ju&s;tly enough concludes, that had this
&s;pring its origin from rain or vapour, there would be found an encrea&s;e or
decrea&s;e of its water, corre&s;ponding to the cau&s;es of its production.</P>
<P>Thus the reader, after having been to&s;&s;ed from one hypothe&s;is
to another, mu&s;t at la&s;t be contented to &s;ettle in con&s;cious ignorance.
All that has been written upon this &s;ubject, affords him rather &s;omething
to &s;ay, than &s;omething to think; &s;omething rather for others than for
him|&s;elf. Varenius, indeed, although he is at a lo&s;s for the origin of
rivers, is by no means &s;o as to their formation. He is pretty po&s;itive that
all <PB N="200" REF="223"> rivers are artificial. He boldly a&s;&s;erts, that
their channels have been originally formed by the indu&s;try of man. His
rea&s;ons are, that when a new &s;pring breaks forth, the water does not make
it&s;elf a new channel, but &s;preads over the adjacent land. Thus, &s;ays he,
men are ob|liged to direct its cour&s;e; or, otherwi&s;e, Nature would never
have found one. He enumerates many rivers, that are certainly known, from
hi&s;tory, to have been dug by men. He alledges, that no &s;alt-water rivers
are found, becau&s;e men did not want &s;alt-water; and as for &s;alt, that was
procurable at a le&s;s expence than digging a river for it. However, it co&s;ts
a &s;peculative man but a &s;mall expence of thinking to form &s;uch an
hypothe&s;is. It may, perhaps, engro&s;s the reader's patience to detain him
longer upon it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, though philo&s;ophy be thus ig|norant, as to the
production of rivers, yet the laws of their motion, and the nature of their
currents, have been very well explained. The Italians have particularly
di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in this re&s;pect; and it is chiefly to them
that we are indebted for the improvement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>S.

<P>All rivers have their &s;ource either in moun|tains, or elevated
lakes; and it is in their de&s;cent <PB N="201" REF="224"> from the&s;e, that
they acquire that velocity which maintains their future current. At fir&s;t
their cour&s;e is generally rapid and headlong; but it is retarded in its
journey, both by the con|tinual friction again&s;t its banks, by the many
ob&s;tacles it meets to divert its &s;tream, and by the plains generally
becoming more level as it approaches towards the &s;ea.</P>
<P>If this acquired velocity be quite &s;pent, and the plain through
which the river pa&s;&s;es is en|tirely level, it will, notwith&s;tanding,
&s;till con|tinue to run from the perpendicular pre&s;&s;ure of the water,
which is always in exact proportion to the depth. This perpendicular
pre&s;&s;ure is nothing more than the weight of the upper waters pre&s;&s;ing
the lower out of their places, and, con&s;equently, driving them forward, as
they cannot recede again&s;t the &s;tream. As this pre&s;&s;ure is greate&s;t
in the deepe&s;t parts of the river, &s;o we generally find the middle of the
&s;tream mo&s;t rapid; both becau&s;e it has the greate&s;t motion thus
communicated by the pre&s;&s;ure, and the fewe&s;t ob&s;tructions from the
banks on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Rivers thus &s;et into motion are almo&s;t always found to make
their own beds. Where they find the bed elevated, they wear its &s;ub&s;tance
away, and depo&s;it the &s;ediment in the next hol|low, <PB N="202" REF="225">
&s;o as in time to make the bottom of their channels even. On the other hand,
the water is continually gnawing and eating away the banks on each &s;ide; and
this with more force as the current happens to &s;trike more directly again&s;t
them. By the&s;e means, it always has a tendency to render them more &s;trait
and pa|rallel to its own cour&s;e. Thus it continues to rectify its banks, and
enlarge its bed; and, con|&s;equently, to dimini&s;h the force of its &s;tream,
till there becomes an equilibrium between the force of the water, and the
re&s;i&s;tance of its banks, upon which both will remain without any further
mutation. And it is happy for man that bounds are thus put to the ero&s;ion of
the earth by water; and that we find all rivers only dig and widen them&s;elves
but to a certain degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Guglielmini della Natura

<P>In tho&s;e plains 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. De Fleuves. Pa&s;&s;im,
vol. ii.</BIBL></NOTE> and large vallies where great rivers flow, the bed of
the river is u&s;ually lower than any part of the valley. But it often
hap|pens, that the &s;urface of the water is higher than many of the grounds
that are adjacent to the banks of the &s;tream. If, after inundations, we take
a view of &s;ome rivers, we &s;hall find their banks appear above water, at a
time that all <PB N="203" REF="226"> the adjacent valley is overflown. This
proceeds from the frequent depo&s;ition of mud, and &s;uch like &s;ub&s;tances,
upon the banks, by the rivers frequently overflowing; and thus, by degrees,
they become elevated above the plain; and the water is often &s;een higher
al&s;o.</P>
<P>Rivers, as every body has &s;een, are always broade&s;t at the
mouth; and grow narrower towards their &s;ource. But what is le&s;s known, and
probably more de&s;erving curio&s;ity, is, that they run in a more direct
channel as they im|mediately leave their &s;ources; and that their
&s;inuo&s;ities and turnings become more nu|merous as they proceed. It is a
certain &s;ign among the &s;avages of North America, that they are near the
&s;ea when they find the rivers winding, and every now and then changing their
direction. And this is even now become an indication to the Europeans
them&s;elves, in their journies through tho&s;e trackle&s;s fore&s;ts. As
tho&s;e &s;inuo&s;ities, therefore, encrea&s;e as the river approaches the
&s;ea, it is not to be wondered at, that they &s;ometimes divide, and thus
di&s;em|bogue by different channels. The Danube di&s;embogues into the Euxine
by &s;even mouths; the Nile, by the &s;ame number; and the Wolga, by
&s;eventy.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="227">The currents 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. De Fleuves. Pa&s;&s;im. vol.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE> of rivers are to be e&s;timated very differently from the
manner in which tho&s;e writers who have given us mathematical the|ories on
this &s;ubject, repre&s;ent them. They found their calculations upon the
&s;urface, being a perfect plain, from one bank to the other: but this is not
the actual &s;tate of Nature; for rivers, in general, ri&s;e in the middle; and
this convexity is greate&s;t in proportion as the rapidity of the &s;tream is
greater. Any per&s;on, to be convinced of this, need only lay his eye as nearly
as he can on a level with the &s;tream, and look|ing acro&s;s to the oppo&s;ite
bank, he will perceive the river in the mid&s;t to be elevated con&s;iderably
above what it is at the edges. This ri&s;ing, in &s;ome rivers, is often found
to be three feet high; and is ever encrea&s;ed, in proportion to the ra|pidity
of the &s;tream. In this ca&s;e, the water in the mid&s;t of the current
lo&s;es a part of its weight, from the velocity of its motion; while that at
the &s;ides, for the contrary rea&s;on, &s;inks lower. It &s;ometimes, however,
happens, that this appearance is rever&s;ed; for when tides are found to flow
up with violence again&s;t the na|tural current of the water, the greate&s;t
rapidity is then found at the &s;ides of the river, as the 
<PB N="205" REF="228"> water there lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ts the influx from the
&s;ea. On tho&s;e occa&s;ions, therefore, the river pre&s;ents a concave rather
than a convex &s;urface: and, as in the former ca&s;e, the middle waters ro&s;e
in a ridge; in this ca&s;e, they &s;ink in a furrow.</P>
<P>The &s;tream in all rivers is more rapid in pro|portion as its
channel is dimini&s;hed. For in|&s;tance, it will be much &s;wifter where it is
ten yards broad, than where it is twenty; for the force behind &s;till
pu&s;hing the water forward, when it comes to the narrow part, it mu&s;t make
up by velocity what it wants in room.</P>
<P>It often happens that the &s;tream of a river is oppo&s;ed by one of
its jutting banks, by an i&s;land in the mid&s;t, the arches of a bridge, or
&s;ome &s;uch ob&s;tacle. This produces, not unfrequent|ly, a back current; and
the water having pa&s;t the arch with great velocity, pu&s;hes the water on
each &s;ide of its direct current. This pro|duces a &s;ide current, tending to
the bank; and not unfrequently a whirlpool; in which a large body of waters are
circulated in a kind of cavity, &s;inking down in the middle. The central point
of the whirlpool is always lowe&s;t, becau&s;e it has the lea&s;t motion: the
other parts are &s;upported, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the violence of theirs;
and, con&s;equently, ri&s;e higher as their motion is greater; &s;o that
towards the extremity of the <PB N="206" REF="229"> whirlpool mu&s;t be higher
than towards the center.</P>
<P>If the &s;tream of a river be &s;topped at the &s;ur|face, and yet
be free below; as for in&s;tance, if it be laid over by a bridge of boats,
there will then be a double current; the water at the &s;urface will flow back,
while that at the bottom will pro|ceed with encrea&s;ed velocity. It often
happens that the current at the bottom is &s;wifter than at the top, when, upon
violent land-floods, the weight of waters towards the &s;ource, pre&s;&s;es the
waters at the bottom, before it has had time to communicate its motion to the
&s;urface. How|ever, in all other ca&s;es, the &s;urface of the &s;tream is
&s;wifter than the bottom, as it is not retarded by rubbing over the bed of the
river.</P>
<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed that bridges, dams, and other ob&s;tacles
in the current of a river, would retard its total velocity. But the difference
they make is very incon&s;iderable. The water, by the&s;e &s;toppages, gets an
elevation above the ob|ject; which, when it has &s;urmounted, it gives a
velocity that recompences the former delay. I&s;lands and turnings al&s;o
retard the cour&s;e of the &s;tream but very incon&s;iderably; any cau&s;e
which dimini&s;hes the quantity of the water, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hes
the force and the velocity of the &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="230">An encrea&s;e 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>
of water in the bed of the river, always encrea&s;es its rapidity; except in
ca&s;es of inundation. The in&s;tant the river has overflowed its banks, the
velocity of its current is always turned that way, and the inundation is
perceived to continue for &s;ome days; which it would not otherwi&s;e do, if,
as &s;oon as the cau&s;e was di&s;continued, it acquired its former
rapidity.</P>
<P>A violent &s;torm, that &s;ets directly up again&s;t the cour&s;e of
the &s;tream, will always retard, and &s;ometimes entirely &s;top its cour&s;e.
I have &s;een an in&s;tance of this, when the bed of a large river was left
entirely dry for &s;ome hours, and fi&s;h were caught among the &s;tones at the
bottom.</P>
<P>Inundations are generally greater towards the &s;ource of rivers,
than farther down; becau&s;e the current is generally &s;wifter below than
above; and that for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>A little river 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Guglielmini,
ibid.</BIBL></NOTE> may be received into a large one, without augmenting either
its width or depth. This, which at fir&s;t view &s;eems a pa|radox, is yet very
ea&s;ily accounted for. The little river, in this ca&s;e, only goes towards
en|crea&s;ing the &s;wiftne&s;s of the larger, and putting its dormant waters
into motion. In this man|ner, <PB N="208" REF="231"> the Venetian branch of the
Po was pu&s;hed on by the Ferare&s;e branch and that of Panaro, without any
enlargement of its breadth or depth from the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A river tending to enter another, either per|pendicularly, or in an
oppo&s;ite direction, will be diverted, by degrees, from that direction; and be
obliged to make it&s;elf a more favourable en|trance downward, and more
con&s;piring with the &s;tream of the former.</P>
<P>The union of two rivers into one, makes it flow the &s;wifter;
&s;ince the &s;ame quantity of water, in&s;tead of rubbing again&s;t four
&s;hores, now only rubs again&s;t two. And, be&s;ides, the current being
deeper, becomes of con&s;equence more fitted for motion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the places from whence rivers proceed, it may be
taken for a general rule, that the large&s;t 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Doctor Halley.</BIBL></NOTE> and
highe&s;t mountains &s;upply the greate&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive rivers. It
may al&s;o be remarked, in whatever direction the ridge of the mountain runs,
the river takes an oppo&s;ite cour&s;e. If the mountain, for in|&s;tance,
&s;tretches from north to &s;outh, the river runs from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and
&s;o contrariwi&s;e. The&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t generally received
opinions with regard to the cour&s;e of rivers; <PB N="209" REF="232"> however,
they are liable to many exceptions; and nothing but an actual knowledge of each
particular river can furni&s;h us with an exact theory of its current.</P>
<P>The large&s;t rivers of Europe are, fir&s;t, the Wolga, which is
about &s;ix hundred and fifty leagues in length, extending from Re&s;chow to
A&s;trachan. It is remarkable of this river, that it abounds with water during
the &s;ummer months of May and June: but all the re&s;t of the year is &s;o
&s;hallow as &s;carce to cover its bottom, or allow a pa&s;&s;age for loaded
ve&s;&s;els that trade up its &s;tream. It was up this river that the Engli&s;h
attempted a trade into Per&s;ia, in which they were &s;o unhappily
di&s;appointed, in the year 1741. The next in order is the Danube. The cour&s;e
of this is about four hundred and fifty leagues, from the mountains of
Switzer|land to the Black Sea. It is &s;o deep between Buda and Belgrade, that
the Turks and Chri|&s;tians have fleets of men of war upon it; which frequently
engaged, during the la&s;t war between the Ottomans and the Au&s;trians:
however, it is unnavigable further down, by rea&s;on of its ca|taracts, which
prevent its commerce into the Black Sea. The Don, or Tanais, which is four
hundred leagues from the &s;ource of that branch of it called the So&s;na, to
its mouth in the Euxine <PB N="210" REF="233"> &s;ea. In one part of its
cour&s;e, it approaches near the Wolga; and Peter the Great had actually begun
a canal, by which he intended joining tho&s;e two rivers; which he did not live
to fini&s;h. The Nieper, or Bori&s;thenes, which ri&s;es in the middle of
Mu&s;covy, and runs a cour&s;e of three hundred and fifty leagues, to empty
it&s;elf into the Black Sea. The Old Co&s;&s;acks inhabit the banks and
i&s;lands of this river; and frequently cro&s;s the Black Sea, to plunder the
maritime places on the coa&s;ts of Turky. The Dwina; which takes its ri&s;e in
a province of the &s;ame name in Ru&s;&s;ia, then runs a cour&s;e of three
hundred leagues, and di&s;embogues into the White Sea, a little below
Archangel.</P>
<P>The large&s;t rivers of A&s;ia are, the Hoanho, in China, which is
eight hundred and fifty leagues in length, computing from its &s;ource at Raja
Ribron, to its mouth in the Gulph of Changi. The Jeni&s;ca of Tartary, about
eight hundred leagues in length, from the Lake Selinga, to the Icy Sea. This
river is, by &s;ome, &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;upply mo&s;t of that great quantity of
drift wood which is &s;een floating in the &s;eas, near the Artic circle. The
Oby, of five hundred leagues, running from the lake of Kila into the Northern
&s;ea. The Amour, in Ea&s;tern Tartary, who&s;e cour&s;e is about five hundred
and &s;eventy-five leagues, from its &s;ource to its <PB N="211" REF="234">
entrance into the &s;ea of Kamt&s;katka. The Kiam, in China, five hundred and
fifty leagues in length. The Ganges, one of the mo&s;t noted rivers in the
world, and about as long as the former. It ri&s;es in the mountains which
&s;eparate India from Tartary; and running through the dominions of the Great
Mogul, di&s;charges it&s;elf by &s;everal mouths into the bay of Bengal. It is
not only e&s;teemed by the Indians for the depth, and purene&s;s of its
&s;tream, but for a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity which they believe to be in its
waters. It is vi&s;ited annually by &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pilgrims, who
pay their de|votions to the river as to a god; for &s;avage &s;im|plicity is
always known to mi&s;take the ble&s;&s;ings of the Deity, for the Deity
him&s;elf. They carry their dying friends from di&s;tant countries, to expire
on its banks; and to be buried in its &s;tream. The water is lowe&s;t in April
or May; but the rains beginning to fall &s;oon after, the flat country is
overflowed for &s;everal miles, till about the end of September; the waters
then begin to retire, leaving a prolific &s;ediment behind, that enriches the
&s;oil, and, in a few days time, gives a luxuriance to vegetation, beyond what
can be conceived by an European. Next to this may be reckoned the &s;till more
celebrated river Eu|phrates. This ri&s;es from two &s;ources, north|ward 
<PB N="212" REF="235"> of the city Erzerum, in Turcomania; and unites about
three days journey below the &s;ame; from whence, after performing a cour&s;e
of five hundred leagues, it falls into the Gulph of Per&s;ia, fifty miles below
the city of Ba&s;&s;ora in Arabia. The river Indus is extended from its
&s;ource to its di&s;charge into the Arabian &s;ea, four hundred leagues.</P>
<P>The large&s;t rivers of Africa are, the Senegal, which runs a
cour&s;e of not le&s;s than eleven hundred leagues, comprehending the Niger,
which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to fall into it. How|ever, later accounts &s;eem
to affirm that the Niger is lo&s;t in the &s;ands, about three hundred miles up
from the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa. Be this as it may, the Senegal is well
known to be na|vigable for more than three hundred leagues up the country; and
how much higher it may reach is not yet di&s;covered, as the dreadful fatality
of the inland parts of Africa, not only deter cu|rio&s;ity, but even avarice,
which is a much &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion. At the end of la&s;t war, of fifty
Engli&s;h men that were &s;ent to the factory at Galam, a place taken from the
French, and nine hundred miles up the river, only one re|turned to tell the
fate of his companions, who were killed by the climate. The celebrated river
Nile is &s;aid to be nine hundred and &s;eventy <PB N="213" REF="236"> leagues,
from its &s;ource among the mountains of the Moon, in Upper Aethiopia, to its
opening into the Mediterranean &s;ea. The &s;ources of this river were
con&s;idered as in&s;crutable by the ancients; and the cau&s;es of its
periodical inun|dation were equally unknown. They have both been a&s;certained
by the mi&s;&s;ionaries who have travelled into the interior parts of
Aethiopia. The Nile takes its ri&s;e in the kingdom of Gojam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher, Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 72.</BIBL></NOTE>, from a
&s;mall aperture on the top of a mountain, which, though not above a foot and
an half over, yet was unfathomable. This foun|tain, when arrived at the foot of
the mountain, expands into a river; and, being joined by others, forms a lake
thirty leagues long, and as many broad; from this, its channel, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, winds back to the country where it fir&s;t began; from thence,
precipitating by fright|ful cataracts, it travels through a variety of
de|&s;art regions, equally formidable, &s;uch as Amha|ra, Olaca, Damot, and
Xaoa. Upon its arrival in the kingdom of Upper Egypt, it runs through a rocky
channel, which &s;ome late travellers have mi&s;taken for its cataracts. In the
beginning of its cour&s;e, it receives many le&s;&s;er rivers into it; and
Pliny was mi&s;taken, in &s;aying that it received none. In the beginning
al&s;o of its cour&s;e, it <PB N="214" REF="237"> has many windings; but, for
above three hund|red leagues from the &s;ea, it runs in a direct line. Its
annual overflowings ari&s;e from a very ob|vious cau&s;e, which is almo&s;t
univer&s;al with all the great rivers that take their &s;ource near the Line.
The rainy &s;ea&s;on, which is periodical in tho&s;e climates, flood the
rivers; and as this al|ways happens in our &s;ummer, &s;o the Nile is at that
time overflown. From the&s;e inundations, the inhabitants of Egypt derive
happine&s;s and plenty; and, when the river does not ari&s;e to its
accu&s;tomed heights, they prepare for an in|different harve&s;t. It begins to
overflow about the &s;eventeenth of June; it generally continues to augment for
forty days, and decrea&s;es in about as many more. This time of encrea&s;e and
de|crea&s;e, however, is much more incon&s;iderable now than it was among the
ancients. Hero|dotus informs us, that it was an hundred days ri&s;ing, and as
many falling; which &s;hews that the inundation was much greater at that time
than at pre&s;ent. Mr. Buffon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
82.</BIBL></NOTE> has a&s;cribed the pre|&s;ent diminution, as well to the
le&s;&s;ening of the mountains of the Moon, by their &s;ub&s;tance hav|ing &s;o
long been wa&s;hed down with the &s;tream, as to the ri&s;ing of the earth in

&s;ince the times of the ancients, that the earth is much rai&s;ed &s;ince

<P>But of all parts of the world, America, as it exhibits the mo&s;t
lofty mountains, &s;o al&s;o it &s;up|plies the large&s;t rivers. The
foremo&s;t of the&s;e is the great river Amazons, which, from its &s;ource in
the lake of Lauricocha, to its di&s;|charge into the We&s;tern Ocean, performs
a cour&s;e of more than twelve hundred leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p. 388.</BIBL></NOTE>. The breadth and depth
of this river is an&s;wer|able to its va&s;t length; and, where its width is
mo&s;t contracted, its depth is augmented in pro|portion. So great is the body
of its waters, that other rivers, though before the objects of admiration,
them&s;elves are lo&s;t in its bo&s;om. It proceeds, after their junction, with
its u&s;ual ap|pearance, without any vi&s;ible change in its breadth or
rapidity; and, if we may &s;o expre&s;s <PB N="216" REF="239"> it, remains
great without o&s;tentation. In &s;ome places it di&s;plays its whole
magnificence, di|viding into &s;everal large branches, and encom|pa&s;&s;ing a
multitude of i&s;lands; and, at length, di&s;charging it&s;elf into the ocean,
by a channel of an hundred and fifty miles broad. Another river, that may
almo&s;t rival the former, is the St. Lawrence, in Canada, which ri&s;ing in
the lake A&s;&s;iniboils, pa&s;&s;es from one lake to another, from
Cri&s;tinaux to Alempigo, from thence to lake Superior; thence to the lake
Hurons; to lake Erie; to lake Ontario; and, at la&s;t, after a cour&s;e of nine
hundred leagues, pours their collected waters into the Atlantic ocean. The
river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi is of more than &s;even hundred leagues in length,
beginning at its &s;ource near the lake A&s;&s;iniboils, and ending at its
opening into the Gulph of Mexico. The river Plate runs a length of more than
eight hundred leagues from its &s;ource in the river Parana, to its mouth. The
river Oroonoko is &s;even hundred and fifty-five leagues in length, from its
&s;ource near Pa&s;to, to its di&s;charge into the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>Such is the amazing length of our greate&s;t rivers; and even in
&s;ome of the&s;e, the mo&s;t re|mote &s;ources very probably yet continue
un|known. In fact, if we con&s;ider the number of <PB N="217" REF="240"> rivers
which they receive, and the little ac|quaintance we have with the regions
through which they run, it is not to be wondered at that geographers are
divided concerning the &s;ources of mo&s;t of them. As among a number of roots
by which nouri&s;hment is conveyed to a &s;tately tree, it is difficult to
determine preci&s;ely that by which the tree is chiefly &s;upplied; &s;o among
the many branches of a great river, it is equally difficult to tell which is
the original. Hence it may ea&s;ily happen, that a &s;maller branch is taken
for the capital &s;tream; and its runnings are pur&s;ued, and delineated, in
prejudice of &s;ome other branch that better de&s;erved the name and the
de&s;cription. In this manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
74.</BIBL></NOTE> in Europe, the Danube is known to receive thirty le&s;&s;er
rivers: the Wolga, thirty-two or thirty-three. In A&s;ia, the Hohanno receives
thirty-five; the Jeni&s;ca above &s;ixty; the Oby as many; the Amour about
forty; the Nanquin receives thirty rivers; the Ganges twenty; and the Euphrates
about eleven. In Africa, the Senegal receives more than twenty rivers; the Nile
receives not one for five hundred leagues upwards, and then only twelve or
thirteen. In America, the river Amazons receives above &s;ixty, and tho&s;e
very con&s;iderable; the river <PB N="218" REF="241"> St. Lawrence about forty,
counting tho&s;e which fall into its lakes; the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi receives
forty; and the river Plate above fifty.</P>
<P>I mentioned the inundations of the Ganges and the Nile, but almo&s;t
every other great river who&s;e &s;ource lies within the tropics, have their
&s;tated inundations al&s;o. The river Pegu has been called, by travellers, the
Indian Nile, be|cau&s;e of the &s;imilar overflowings of its &s;tream: this it
does to an extent of thirty leagues on each &s;ide; and &s;o fertilizes the
&s;oil, that the inha|bitants &s;end great quantities of rice into other
countries, and have &s;till abundance for their own con&s;umption. The river
Senegal has like|wi&s;e its inundations, which cover the whole flat country of
Negroland, beginning and ending much about the &s;ame time with tho&s;e of the
Nile; as, in fact, both rivers ri&s;e from the &s;ame mountains. But the
difference between the effects of the inundations in each river, is
re|markable: in the one, it di&s;tributes health and plenty; but in the other,
di&s;ea&s;es, famine, and death. The inhabitants along the torrid coa&s;ts of
the Senegal, can receive no benefit from any additional manure the river may
carry down to their &s;oil, which is, by nature, more than &s;uffi|ciently
luxuriant; or, even if they could, they have not indu&s;try to turn it to any
advantage. <PB N="219" REF="242"> The banks, therefore, of the rivers, lie
uncul|tivated, overgrown with rank and noxious her|bage, and infe&s;ted with
thou&s;ands of animals of various malignity. Every new flood only tends to
encrea&s;e the rankne&s;s of the &s;oil, and to pro|vide fre&s;h &s;helter for
the creatures that infe&s;t it. If the flood continues but a few days longer
than u&s;ual, the improvident inhabitants, who are driven up into the higher
grounds, begin to want provi&s;ions, and a famine en&s;ues. When the river
begins to return into its channel, the hu|midity and heat of the air are
equally fatal; and the carca&s;es of infinite numbers of animals, &s;wept away
by the inundation, putrefying in the &s;un, produce a &s;tench that is almo&s;t
in&s;upport|able. But even the luxuriance of the vegetation it&s;elf, becomes a
nui&s;ance. I have been a&s;&s;ured, by per&s;ons of veracity that have been up
the river Senegal, that there are &s;ome plants that grow along the coa&s;t,
the &s;mell of which is &s;o powerful, that it is hardly to be endured. It is
certain, that all the &s;ailors and &s;oldiers who have been at any of our
factories there, a&s;cribe the unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the voyage up the
&s;tream, to the vegetable vapour. However this be, the inundations of the
rivers in this wretched part of the globe, contribute &s;carce any advantage,
if we except to the beauty of <PB N="220" REF="243"> the pro&s;pects which they
afford. The&s;e, indeed, are fini&s;hed up beyond the utmo&s;t reach of art: a
&s;pacious gla&s;&s;y river, with its banks here and there fringed to the very
&s;urface by the man|grove-tree, that grows down into the water, pre&s;ents
it&s;elf to view. Lofty fore&s;ts of various colours, with openings between,
carpeted with green plants, and the mo&s;t gaudy flowers; bea&s;ts and animals,
of various kinds, that &s;tand upon the banks of the river, and, with a &s;ort
of wild curio&s;ity, &s;urvey the mariners as they pa&s;s, contribute to
heighten the &s;cene. This is the &s;ketch of an African pro&s;pect; which
delights the eye, even while it de&s;troys the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e annually periodical inundations, there are many
rivers that overflow at much &s;horter intervals. Thus mo&s;t of tho&s;e in
Peru and Chili have &s;carce any motion by night; but upon the appearance of
the morning &s;un, they re&s;ume their former rapidity: this proceeds from the
mountain &s;nows, which melting with the heat, encrea&s;e the &s;tream, and
continue to drive on the current while the &s;un continues to di&s;&s;olve
them. Some rivers al&s;o flow with an even &s;teady cur|rent, from their
&s;ource to the &s;ea; others flow with greater rapidity, their &s;tream being
poured down in a cataract, or &s;wallowed by the &s;ands, before they reach the
&s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="244">The rivers of tho&s;e countries that have been
lea&s;t inhabited, are u&s;ually more rocky, uneven, and broken into
water-falls or cataracts, than tho&s;e where the indu&s;try of man has been
more prevalent. Wherever man comes, nature puts on a milder appearance: the
terrible and the &s;ublime, are exchanged for the gentle and the u&s;eful; the
cataract is &s;loped away into a placid &s;tream; and the banks become more
&s;mooth and even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.

have been taught to con|&s;pire with the de&s;ires of her controller. Every
one's experience mu&s;t have &s;upplied in&s;tances of rivers thus being made
to flow more evenly, and more beneficially to mankind; but there are &s;ome
who&s;e currents are &s;o rapid, and falls &s;o precipitate, that no art can
obviate; and that mu&s;t for ever remain as amazing in&s;tances of incorrigible
nature.</P>
<P>Of this kind are the cataracts of the Rhine; one of which I have
&s;een exhibit a very &s;trange appearance; it was that at Schathau&s;en, which
was frozen quite acro&s;s, and the water &s;tood in columns where the cataract
had formerly fallen. The Nile, as was &s;aid, has its cataracts. The 
<PB N="222" REF="245"> river Vologda, in Ru&s;&s;ia, has two. The river Zara,
in Africa, has one near its &s;ource. The river Velino, in Italy, has a
cataract of above an hundred and fifty feet perpendicular. Near the city
Gottenburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.
325.</BIBL></NOTE>, in Sweden, the river there ru&s;hes down from a prodigious
high pre|cipice, into a deep pit, with a terrible noi&s;e, and &s;uch dreadful
force, that tho&s;e trees de|&s;igned for the ma&s;ts of &s;hips, which are
floated down the river, u&s;ually are turned up&s;ide down in their fall, and
often are &s;hattered to pieces, by being da&s;hed again&s;t the &s;urface of
the water in the pit; this occurs if the ma&s;ts fall &s;ideways upon the
water; but if they fall end ways, they dive &s;o far under water, that they
di&s;appear for a quarter of an hour, or more: the pit into which they are thus
plunged, has been often &s;ounded with a line of &s;ome hundred fathoms long,
but no ground has been found hitherto. There is al&s;o a cataract at
Power&s;court, in Ire|land, in which, if I am rightly informed, the water falls
three hundred feet perpendicular; which is a greater de&s;cent than that of any
other cataract in any part of the world. There is a cataract at Albany, in the
province of New York, which pours its &s;tream fifty feet per|pendicular. But
of all the cataracts in the <PB N="223" REF="246"> world, that of Niagara, in
Canada, if we con|&s;ider the great body of water that falls, mu&s;t be allowed
to be the greate&s;t, and the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing.</P>
<P>This amazing fall of water is made by the river St. Lawrence, in its
pa&s;&s;age from the lake Erie into the lake Ontario. We have already &s;aid
that St. Lawrence was one of the large&s;t rivers in the world; and yet the
whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of an hundred and fifty
feet perpendicular. It is not ea&s;y to bring the imagination to corre&s;pond
with the greatne&s;s of the &s;cene; a river, extremely deep and rapid, and
that &s;erves to drain the waters of almo&s;t all North America into the
At|lantic ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that
ri&s;e, like a wall, acro&s;s the whole bed of its &s;tream. The width of the
river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks,
where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not
&s;treight acro&s;s, but hollowing inwards like an hor&s;e-&s;hoe; &s;o that
the cataract, which bends to the &s;hape of the ob&s;tacle, round|ing inwards,
pre&s;ents a kind of theatre the mo&s;t tremendous in nature. Ju&s;t in the
middle of this circular wall of waters, a little i&s;land, that has braved the
fury of the current, pre&s;ents one <PB N="224" REF="247"> of its points, and
divides the &s;tream at top into two; but it unites again long before it has
got to the bottom. The noi&s;e of the fall is heard at &s;everal leagues
di&s;tance; and the fury of the waters at the bottom of their fall, is
inconceiv|able. The da&s;hing produces a mi&s;t that ri&s;es to the very
clouds; and that produces a mo&s;t beautiful rainbow, when the &s;un &s;hines.
It may ea&s;ily be conceived, that &s;uch a cataract quite de&s;troys the
navigation of the &s;tream; and yet &s;ome Indian canoes, as it is &s;aid, have
been known to venture down it with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e rivers that lo&s;e them&s;elves in the &s;ands, or are
&s;wallowed up by cha&s;ms in the earth, we have various information. What we
are told by the ancients, of the river Al|pheus, in Arcadia, that &s;inks into
the ground, and ri&s;es again near Syracu&s;e, in Sicily, where it takes the
name of Arethu&s;a, is rather more known than credited. But we have better
in|formation with re&s;pect to the river Tigris being lo&s;t in this manner
under Mount Taurus; of the Guadalquiver, in Spain, being buried in the &s;ands;
of the river Greatah, in York&s;hire, running underground, and ri&s;ing again;
and even of the great Rhine it&s;elf, a part of which is no doubt lo&s;t in the
&s;ands, a little above Leyden. But it ought to be ob&s;erved of this 
<PB N="225" REF="248"> river, that by much the greate&s;t part arrives at the
ocean. For, although the ancient channel which fell into the &s;ea, a little to
the we&s;t of that city, be now entirely choaked up, yet there are &s;till a
number of &s;mall canals, that carry a great body of waters to the &s;ea: and,
be&s;ides, it has al&s;o two very large openings, the Lech, and the Wal, below
Rotterdam, by which it empties it&s;elf abundantly.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, nothing is more common in &s;ultry and &s;andy
de&s;erts, than rivers being thus either lo&s;t in the &s;ands, or entirely
dried up by the &s;un. And hence we &s;ee, that under the Line, the &s;mall
rivers are but few; for &s;uch little &s;treams as are common in Europe, and
which with us receive the name of rivers, would quickly evaporate, in tho&s;e
parching and ex|ten&s;ive de&s;erts. It is even confidently a&s;&s;erted, that
the great river Niger it&s;elf is thus lo&s;t be|fore it reaches the ocean; and
that its &s;uppo&s;ed mouths, the Gambia, and the Senegal, are di&s;tinct
rivers, that come a va&s;t way from the in|terior parts of the country. It
appears, there|fore, that the rivers under the Line are large; but it is
otherwi&s;e at the Poles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's Hi&s;tory of
Greenland, vol. i. p. 41.</BIBL></NOTE>, where they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
&s;mall. In that de&s;olate <PB N="226" REF="249"> region, as the mountains are
covered with per|petual ice, which melts but little, or not at all, the
&s;prings and rivulets are furni&s;hed with a very &s;mall &s;upply. Here,
therefore, men and bea&s;ts would peri&s;h, and die for thir&s;t, if Providence
had not ordered, that in the harde&s;t winter, thaws &s;hould intervene, which
depo&s;it a &s;mall quantity of &s;now-water in pools under the ice; and from
this &s;ource the wretched inhabitants drain a &s;canty beverage.</P>
<P>Thus, whatever quarter of the globe we turn to, we &s;hall find new
rea&s;ons to be &s;atisfied with that part of it in which we our&s;elves
re&s;ide. Our rivers furni&s;h all the plenty of the African &s;tream, without
its inundation; they have all the coolne&s;s of the Polar rivulet, with a more
con&s;tant &s;upply; they may want the terrible magnificence of huge cataracts,
or exten&s;ive lakes, but they are more navigable, and more tran&s;parent;
though le&s;s deep and rapid than the rivers of the torrid zone, they are more
manageable, and only wait the will of man to take their direction. The rivers
of the torrid zone, like the monarchs of the country, rule with de&s;potic
tyranny, profu&s;e in their boun|ties, and ungovernable in their rage. The
ri|vers of Europe, like their kings, are the friends, and not the
oppre&s;&s;ors of the people; bounded by known limits, abridged in the

only at freedom to di&s;tribute happine&s;s and plenty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the Ocean in general; and of its Saltne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IF we look upon a map of the world, we &s;hall find that the ocean
occupies con&s;iderably more of the globe, than the land is found to do. This
immen&s;e body of waters is diffu&s;ed round both the Old and New Continent, to
the &s;outh; and may &s;urround them al&s;o to the north, for what we know, but
the ice in tho&s;e regions has &s;topped our enquiries. Although the ocean,
properly &s;peaking, is but one exten&s;ive &s;heet of waters, continued over
every part of the globe, without interruption, and although no part of it is
divided from the re&s;t, yet geographers have di&s;tingui&s;hed it by different
names; as the At|lantic or We&s;tern Ocean, the Northern Ocean, the Southern
Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. Others have divided it
differ|ently, and given other names; as the Frozen Ocean, the Inferior Ocean,
or the American Ocean. But all the&s;e being arbitrary di|&s;tinctions, and not
of Nature's making, the na|turali&s;t may con&s;ider them with
indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="251">In this va&s;t receptacle, almo&s;t all the
rivers of the earth ultimately terminate; nor do &s;uch great &s;upplies &s;eem
to encrea&s;e its &s;tores; for it is neither apparently &s;wollen by their
tribute, nor dimini&s;hed by their failure; it &s;till continues the &s;ame.
Indeed, what is the quantity of water of all the rivers and lakes in the world,
compared to that contained in this great recep|tacle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 70.</BIBL></NOTE>? If we &s;hould offer
to make a rude e&s;ti|mate, we &s;hall find that all the rivers in the world,
flowing into the bed of the &s;ea, with a continuance of their pre&s;ent
&s;tores, would take up at lea&s;t eight hundred years to fill it to its
pre&s;ent height. For, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ea to be eighty-five millions of
&s;quare miles in extent, and a quarter of a mile, upon an average, in depth,
this, upon calculation, will give above twenty-one millions of cubic miles of
water, as the contents of the whole ocean. Now, to e&s;timate the quantity of
water which all the rivers &s;upply, take any one of them; the Po, for
in&s;tance, the quantity of who&s;e di&s;charge into the &s;ea, is known to be
one cubic mile of water in twenty-&s;ix days. Now it will be found, upon a rude
computation, from the quantity of ground the Po, with its influent &s;treams,
covers, that all the rivers of the world furni&s;h about <PB N="229" REF="252">
two thou&s;and times that quantity of water. In the &s;pace of a year,
therefore, they will have di&s;charged into the &s;ea about twenty-&s;ix
thou|&s;and cubic miles of water; and not till eight hundred years, will they
have di&s;charged as much water as is contained in the &s;ea at pre&s;ent. I
have not troubled the reader with the odd numbers, le&s;t he &s;hould imagine I
was giving preci&s;ion to a &s;ubject that is incapable of it.</P>
<P>Thus great is the a&s;&s;emblage of waters diffu&s;ed round our
habitable globe; and yet, immea&s;ur|able as they &s;eem, they are mo&s;tly
rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient to the nece&s;&s;ities and the conveniencies of &s;o
little a being as man. Neverthele&s;s, if it &s;hould be a&s;ked whether they
be made for him alone, the que&s;tion is not ea&s;ily re&s;olved. Some
philo&s;ophers have perceived &s;o much analogy to man in the formation of the
ocean, that they have not he&s;itated to a&s;&s;ert its being made for him
alone. The di&s;tribution of land and water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham Phy&s;ico Theol.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;ay they, is
admirable; the one being laid again&s;t the other &s;o &s;kilfully, that there
is a ju&s;t equipoi&s;e of the whole globe. Thus the Northern ocean balances
again&s;t the Southern; and the New Continent is an exact counter-weight to the
Old. As to any objection from the ocean's occupying too large a &s;hare of 
<PB N="230" REF="253"> the globe, they contend, that there could not have been
a &s;maller &s;urface employed to &s;upply the earth with a due &s;hare of
evaporation. On the other hand, &s;ome take the gloomy &s;ide of the
que&s;tion; they either magnify

Pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE> what &s;eems defects to us, may be real beauties to
&s;ome wi&s;er order of beings. They ob&s;erve, that multitudes of ani|mals are
concealed in the ocean, and but a &s;mall part of them are known; the re&s;t,
therefore, they fail not to &s;ay, were certainly made for their own benefit,
and not for ours. How far either of the&s;e opinions be ju&s;t, I will not
pre&s;ume to determine; but of this we are certain, that God has endowed us
with abilities to turn this great extent of waters to our own advantage. He has
made the&s;e things, perhaps, for other u&s;es; but he has given us faculties
to convert them to our own. This much agi|tated que&s;tion, therefore, &s;eems
to terminate here. We &s;hall never know whether the things of this world have
been made for our u&s;e; but we very well know, that we have been made to enjoy
them. Let us then boldly affirm, that the earth, and all its wonders, are ours;
&s;ince we are furni&s;hed with powers to force them into <PB N="231" REF="254"> our &s;ervice. Man is the lord of all the &s;ublunary creation; the
howling &s;avage, the winding &s;er|pent, with all the untamable and rebellious
off|&s;pring of Nature, are de&s;troyed in the conte&s;t, or driven at a
di&s;tance from his habitations. The exten&s;ive and tempe&s;tuous ocean,
in&s;tead of li|miting or dividing his power, only &s;erves to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
indu&s;try, and enlarge the &s;phere of his en|joyments. Its billows, and its
mon&s;ters, in&s;tead of pre&s;enting a &s;cene of terror, only call up the
courage of this little intrepid being; and the greate&s;t dangers that man now
fears on the deep, is from his fellow creatures. Indeed, when I con&s;ider the
human race as Nature has formed them, there is but very little of the habitable
globe that &s;eems made for them. But when I con&s;ider them as accumulating
the experience of ages, in commanding the earth, there is nothing &s;o great,
or &s;o terrible. What a poor contemptible being is the naked &s;avage,
&s;tanding on the beach of the ocean, and trem|bling at its tumults! How little
capable is he of converting its terrors into benefits; or of &s;aying, behold
an element made wholly for my enjoy|ment! He con&s;iders it as an angry deity,
and pays it the homage of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But it is very different when he
has exerci&s;ed his mental <PB N="232" REF="255"> powers; when he has learned
to find his own &s;uperiority, and to make it &s;ub&s;ervient to his commands.
It is then that his dignity begins to appear, and that the true Deity is
ju&s;tly prai&s;ed for having been mindful of man; for having given him the
earth for his habitation, and the &s;ea for an inheritance.</P>
<P>This power which man has obtained over the ocean, was at fir&s;t
enjoyed in common; and none pretended to a right in that element where all
&s;eemed intruders. The &s;ea, therefore, was open to all till the time of the
emperor Ju&s;ti|nian. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or Leo granted &s;uch as were in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hore, the &s;ole right of fi&s;hing before their
re&s;pective territories. The Thracian Bo&s;phorus was the fir&s;t that was
thus appropriated; and from that time it has been the &s;truggle of mo&s;t of
the powers of Europe to obtain an exclu&s;ive right in this element. The
Republic of Venice claims the Adriatic. The Danes are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Baltic. But the Engli&s;h have a more exten&s;ive claim to the empire of
all the &s;eas, encompa&s;&s;ing the king|doms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland; and altho' the&s;e have been long conte&s;ted, yet they are now
con&s;idered as their indi&s;putable pro|perty. Every one knows that the great
power <PB N="233" REF="256"> of the nation is exerted on this element; and that
the in&s;tant England cea&s;es to be &s;uperior upon the ocean, its &s;afety
begins to be pre|carious.</P>
<P>It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to our depend|ance upon the &s;ea,
and to our commerce there, that we are &s;o well acquainted with its extent and
figure. The bays, gulphs, currents, and &s;hallows of the ocean, are much
better known and examined than the provinces and kingdoms of the earth
it&s;elf. The hopes of acquiring wealth by commerce, has carried man to much
greater lengths than the de&s;ire of gaining in|formation could have done. In
con&s;equence of this, there is &s;carce a &s;trait or an harbour, &s;carce a
rock or a quick&s;and, &s;carce an inflexion of the &s;hore, or the jutting of
a promontory, that has not been minutely de&s;cribed. But as the&s;e pre&s;ent
very little entertainment to the imagination, or delight to any but tho&s;e
who&s;e pur&s;uits are lucrative, they need not be dwelt upon here. While the
merchant and the ma|riner are &s;olicitous in de&s;cribing currents and
&s;oundings, the naturali&s;t is employed in ob|&s;erving wonders, though not
&s;o beneficial, yet to him of a much more important nature. The &s;altne&s;s
of the &s;ea &s;eems to be the foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Whence the &s;ea has derived that peculiar bit|teri&s;h &s;altne&s;s
which we find in it, appears, by <PB N="234" REF="257"> Ari&s;totle, to have
exerci&s;ed the curio&s;ity of na|turali&s;ts in all ages. He &s;uppo&s;ed (and
man|kind were for ages content with the &s;olution) that the &s;un continually
rai&s;ed dry &s;aline exha|lations from the earth, and depo&s;ited them upon
the &s;ea; and hence, &s;ay his followers, the waters of the &s;ea are more
&s;alt at top than at bottom. But, unfortunately for this opinion, neither of
the facts is true. Sea &s;alt is not to be rai&s;ed by the vapours of the
&s;un; and &s;ea water is not &s;alter at the top than at the bottom. Father
Bohours is of opinion that the Creator gave the waters of the ocean their
&s;altne&s;s at the begin|ing; not only to prevent their corruption, but to
enable them to bear greater burthens. But their &s;altne&s;s does not prevent
their corruption; for &s;tagnant &s;ea-water, like fre&s;h, &s;oon grows
putrid: and, as for their bearing greater bur|thens, fre&s;h water an&s;wers
all the purpo&s;es of navigation quite as well. The e&s;tabli&s;hed opi|nion,
therefore, is that of Boyle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
221.</BIBL></NOTE>, who &s;uppo&s;es, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the &s;ea's &s;altne&s;s is &s;upplied not
only from rocks or ma&s;&s;es of &s;alt at the bottom of the &s;ea, but al&s;o
from the &s;alt which the rains and rivers, and other waters, di&s;&s;olve in
their pa&s;&s;age thro' many parts of the earth, and at length carry with them
to the &s;ea."</Q> But as there is a differ|ence <PB N="235" REF="258"> in the
ta&s;te of rock-&s;alt found at land, and that di&s;&s;olved in the waters of
the ocean, this may be produced by the plenty of nitrous and bituminous bodies
that, with the &s;alts, are like|wi&s;e wa&s;hed into that great receptacle.
The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances being thus once carried to the &s;ea, mu&s;t for ever
remain there; for they do not ri&s;e by evaporation, &s;o as to be returned
back from whence they came. Nothing but the fre&s;h waters of the &s;ea ri&s;e
in vapours; and all the &s;altne&s;s remains behind. From hence it follows,
that every year the &s;ea mu&s;t become more and more &s;alt; and this
&s;peculation Doctor Halley carries &s;o far as to lay down a method of finding
out the age of the world by the &s;altne&s;s of its waters. 
<Q REND="inline">"For if it be ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. v. p. 218.</BIBL></NOTE>," &s;ays he,
"what quantity of &s;alt is at pre&s;ent con|tained in a certain weight of
water, taken up from the Ca&s;pian Sea, for example, and, after &s;ome
centuries, what greater quantity of &s;alt is contained in the &s;ame weight of
water, taken from the &s;ame place; we may conclude, that in proportion as the
&s;altne&s;s has encrea&s;ed in a certain time, &s;o much mu&s;t it have
encrea&s;ed before that time; and we may thus, by the rule of proportion, make
an e&s;timate of the whole time wherein the water would acquire the degree 
<PB N="236" REF="259"> of &s;altne&s;s it &s;hould be then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of."</Q> All this may be fine; however, an experiment, be|gun in this century,
which is not to be completed till &s;ome centuries hence, is rather a little
mor|tifying to modern curio&s;ity: and, I am induced to think, the inhabitants
round the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, will not be apt to undertake the enquiry.</P>
<P>This &s;altne&s;s is found to prevail in every part of the ocean;
and as much at the &s;urface, as at the bottom. It is al&s;o found in all
tho&s;e &s;eas that communicate with the ocean; but ra|ther in a le&s;s
degree.</P>
<P>The great lakes, likewi&s;e, that have no out|lets nor communication
with the ocean, are found to be &s;alt; but &s;ome of them in le&s;s
proportion. On the contrary, all tho&s;e lakes through which rivers run into
the &s;ea, however exten&s;ive they be, are, notwith&s;tanding, very fre&s;h:
for the rivers do not depo&s;it their &s;alts in the bed of the lake, but carry
them, with their currents, into the ocean. Thus the lakes Ontario and Erie, in
North America, although for mag|nitude they may be con&s;idered as inland
&s;eas, are, neverthele&s;s, fre&s;h water lakes; and kept &s;o by the river
St. Lawrence, which pa&s;&s;es through them. But tho&s;e lakes that have no
communication with the &s;ea, nor any rivers going out, although they be le&s;s
than the <PB N="237" REF="260"> former, are, however, always &s;alt. Thus, that
which goes by the name of the Dead Sea, tho' very &s;mall, when compared to
tho&s;e already mentioned, is &s;o exceedingly &s;alt, that its waters &s;eem
&s;carce capable of di&s;&s;olving any more. The lakes of Mexico, and of
Titicaca, in Peru, though of no great extent, are, neverthele&s;s &s;alt; and
both for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are willing to turn all things to the be&s;t, have not
failed to con&s;ider this &s;alt|ne&s;s of the &s;ea, as a peculiar
ble&s;&s;ing from Pro|vidence, in order to keep &s;o great an element &s;weet
and whol&s;ome. What foundation there may be in the remark, I will not pretend
to determine; but we &s;hall &s;hortly find a much better cau&s;e for its being
kept &s;weet, namely by its motion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there have been many who have con&s;idered the
&s;ubject in a different light, and have tried every endeavour to make
&s;alt-water fre&s;h, &s;o as to &s;upply the wants of mariners in long
voyages, or when exhau&s;ted of their ordinary &s;tores. At fir&s;t it was
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;imple di&s;tillation would do; but it was &s;oon found that the
bitter part of the water &s;till kept mixed. It was then tried by uniting
&s;alt of Tartar with &s;ea-water, and di&s;tilling both: but here the expence
was greater than the ad|vantage. Calcined bones were next thought 
<PB N="238" REF="261"> of; but an hog&s;head of calcined bones, carried to
&s;ea, would take up as much room as an hog&s;head of water, and was more hard
to be ob|tained. In this &s;tate, therefore, have the attempts to &s;weeten
&s;ea-water re&s;ted; the chymi&s;t &s;atisfied with the reality of his
invention; and the ma|riner convinced of its being u&s;ele&s;s. I cannot,
therefore, avoid mentioning a kind of &s;ucceda|neum which has been lately
conceived to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of fre&s;h-water, when mariners are quite
exhau&s;ted. It is well known, that per&s;ons who go into a warm bath, come out
&s;everal ounces heavier than they went in; their bodies having imbibed a
corre&s;pondent quantity of water. This more particularly happens, if they have
been previou&s;ly debarred from drinking, or go in with a violent thir&s;t;
which they quickly find quenched, and their &s;pirits re&s;tored. It was
&s;uppo&s;ed, that in ca&s;e of a total failure of fre&s;h-water at &s;ea, a
warm bath might be made of &s;ea-water, for the u&s;e of mariners; and that
their pores would thus imbibe the fluid, without any of its &s;alts, which
would be &s;een to cry|&s;tallize on the &s;urface of their bodies. In this
manner, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, a &s;ufficient quantity of moi&s;ture may be
procured to &s;u&s;tain life, till time or accident furni&s;h a more copious
&s;upply.</P>
<P>But, however this be, the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea 
<PB N="239" REF="262"> can by no means be con&s;idered as a principal cau&s;e
in pre&s;erving its waters from putrefaction. The ocean has its currents, like
rivers, which circulate its contents round the globe; and the&s;e may be &s;aid
to be the great agents that keep it &s;weet and whol&s;ome. Its &s;altne&s;s
alone would by no means an&s;wer this purpo&s;e: and &s;ome have even imagined,
that the various &s;ub&s;tances with which it is mixed, rather tend to promote
pu|tre&s;ence than impede it. Sir Robert Hawkins, one of our mo&s;t enlightened
navigators, gives the following account of a calm, in which the &s;ea
continuing for &s;ome time without motion, began to a&s;&s;ume a very
formidable appearance. 
<Q REND="inline">"Were it not," &s;ays he, "for the moving of the
&s;ea, by the force of winds, tides, and cur|rents, it would corrupt all the
world. The ex|periment of this I &s;ay in the year 1590, lying with a fleet
about the i&s;lands of Azores, almo&s;t &s;ix months; the greate&s;t part of
which time we were becalmed. Upon which all the &s;ea be|came &s;o
repleni&s;hed with &s;everal &s;orts of gellies, and forms of &s;erpents,
adders, and &s;nakes, as &s;eemed wonderful: &s;ome green, &s;ome black, &s;ome
yellow, &s;ome white, &s;ome of divers colours, and many of them had life; and
&s;ome there were an yard and an half, and two yards long; which had I not
&s;een, I could hardly have <PB N="240" REF="263"> believed. And hereof are
witne&s;&s;es all the company of the &s;hips which were then pre&s;ent: &s;o
that hardly a man could draw a bucket of water clear of &s;ome corruption. In
which voyage, towards the end thereof, many of every &s;hip fell &s;ick, and
began to die apace. But the &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age into our country, was a remedy
to the craz'd, and a pre&s;ervative for tho&s;e that were not touched."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;hews, abundantly, how little the &s;ea's &s;altne&s;s was
capable of pre&s;erving it from pu|trefaction: but to put the matter beyond all
doubt, Mr. Boyle kept a quantity of &s;ea-water, taken up in the Engli&s;h
channel, for &s;ome time barrelled up; and, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, it
began to acquire a foetid &s;mell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol.
iii. p. 222.</BIBL></NOTE>: He was al&s;o a&s;&s;ured, by one of his
acquaintance who was becalmed for twelve or fourteen days in the Indian &s;ea,
that the water, for want of motion, began to &s;tink; and that had it continued
much longer, the &s;tench would probably have poi&s;oned him. It is the motion,
therefore, and not the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea, that pre&s;erves it in its
pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;alubrity; and this, very probably, by da&s;hing and
breaking in pieces the rudiments, if I may &s;o call them, of the various
animals that would otherwi&s;e breed there, and puterfy.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="264">There are &s;ome advantages, however, which
are derived from the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea. Its waters being evaporated,
furni&s;h that &s;alt which is u&s;ed for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es; and, although
in &s;ome places it is made from &s;prings, and, in others, dug out of mines,
yet the greate&s;t quantity is made only from the &s;ea. That which is called
bay-&s;alt, (from its coming to us by the Bay of Bi&s;cay) is a &s;tronger
kind, made by eva|poration in the &s;un: that called common &s;alt, is
evaporated in pans over the fire, and is of a much inferior quality to the
former.</P>
<P>Another benefit ari&s;ing from the quantity of &s;alt di&s;&s;olved
in the &s;ea, is, that it thus becomes heavier, and, con&s;equently, more
buoyant. Mr. Boyle, who examined the difference between &s;ea-water and
fre&s;h, found that the former appeared to be about a forty-fifth part heavier
than the latter. Tho&s;e, al&s;o, who have had opportunities of bathing in the
&s;ea, pretend to have expe|rienced a much greater ea&s;e in &s;wimming there,
than in fre&s;h water. However, as we &s;ee they have only a forty-fifth part
more of their weight &s;u&s;tained by it, I am apt to doubt whether &s;o minute
a difference can be practically per|ceivable. Be this as it may, as &s;ea-water
alters in its weight from fre&s;h, &s;o it is found al&s;o to differ from
it&s;elf in different parts of the ocean. <PB N="242" REF="265"> In general, it
is perceived to be heavier, and, con&s;equently, &s;alter, the nearer we
approach the Line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.
297.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there is an advantage ari&s;ing from the &s;altne&s;s of the
waters of the &s;ea, much greater than what has been yet mentioned; which is,
that their congelation is thus retarded. Some, indeed, have gone &s;o far as to
&s;ay, that 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Macrobius.</BIBL></NOTE>
&s;ea-water never freezes: but this is an a&s;&s;ertion con|tradicted by
experience. However, it is cer|tain that it requires a much greater degree of
cold to freeze it, than fre&s;h water; &s;o that, while rivers and &s;prings
are &s;een converted into one &s;olid body of ice, the &s;ea is always fit for
na|vigation, and no way affected by the coldne&s;s of the &s;evere&s;t winter.
It is, therefore, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we derive from this
element, that when at land all the &s;tores of Nature are locked up from us, we
find the &s;ea ever open to our nece&s;&s;ities, and patient of the hand of
indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e in our temperate
climate we never &s;ee the &s;ea frozen, that it is in the &s;ame manner open
in every part of it. A very little acquaintance with the ac|counts of mariners,
mu&s;t have informed us, that at the polar regions it is embarra&s;&s;ed with
moun|tains, <PB N="243" REF="266"> and moving &s;heets of ice, that often
ren|der it impa&s;&s;able. The&s;e tremendous floats are of different
magnitudes; &s;ometimes ri&s;ing more than a thou&s;and feet above the
&s;urface of the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's Hi&s;tory of
Greenland, vol. i. p. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;ometimes diffu&s;ed into plains of
above two hundred leagues in length; and, in many parts, &s;ixty or eighty
broad. They are u&s;ually divided by fi&s;&s;ures; one piece following another
&s;o clo&s;e, that a per&s;on may &s;tep from one to the other. Sometimes
mountains are &s;een ri&s;ing amid&s;t the&s;e plains, and pre&s;enting the
appear|ance of a variegated land&s;cape, with hills and valleys, hou&s;es,
churches, and towers. The&s;e are appearances in which all naturali&s;ts are
agreed; but the great conte&s;t is re&s;pecting their formation. Mr. Buffon
a&s;&s;erts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buf|fon, vol. ii. p.
91.</BIBL></NOTE>, that they are formed from fre&s;h water alone; which
congealing at the mouths of great rivers, ac|cumulate tho&s;e huge ma&s;&s;es
that di&s;turb navi|gation. However, this great naturali&s;t &s;eems not to
have been aware that there are two &s;orts of ice floating in the&s;e &s;eas;
the flat ice, and the mountain ice: the one formed of &s;ea-water only; the
other, of fre&s;h<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The flat, or driving ice, is entirely compo&s;ed 
<PB N="244" REF="267"> of &s;ea-water; which, upon di&s;&s;olution, is found to
be &s;alt; and is readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mountain or fre&s;h-water
ice, by its whitene&s;s, and want of tran&s;parency. This ice is much more
terrible to mariners than that which ri&s;es up in lumps: a &s;hip can avoid
the one, as it is &s;een at a di&s;tance; but it often gets in among the other,
which &s;ometimes clo&s;ing, cru&s;hes it to pieces. This, which manife&s;tly
has a dif|ferent origin from the fre&s;h-water ice, may per|haps have been
produced in the Icy Sea, be|neath the Pole; or along the coa&s;ts of
Spitz|berg, or Nova Zembla.</P>
<P>The mountain-ice, as was &s;aid, is different in every re&s;pect,
being formed of fre&s;h water, and appearing hard and tran&s;parent; it is
ge|nerally of a pale green colour, though &s;ome pieces are of a beautiful
&s;ky blue; many large ma&s;&s;es, al&s;o, appear grey; and &s;ome black. If
examined more nearly, they are found to be in|corporated with earth, &s;tones,
and bru&s;h-wood wa&s;hed from the &s;hore. On the&s;e al&s;o, are &s;ometimes
found, not only earth, but ne&s;ts with birds eggs, at &s;everal hundred miles
from land. The generality of the&s;e, though almo&s;t totally fre&s;h, have,
neverthele&s;s, a thick cru&s;t of &s;alt-water frozen upon them, probably from
the power that ice has &s;ometimes to produce ice. <PB N="245" REF="268"> Such
mountains as are here de&s;cribed, are mo&s;t u&s;ually &s;een at
&s;pring-time, and after a violent &s;torm, driving out to &s;ea, where they at
fir&s;t terrify the mariner, and are &s;oon after da&s;hed to pieces by the
continual wa&s;hing of the waves; or driven into the warmer regions of the
&s;outh, there to be melted away. They &s;ometimes, however, &s;trike back upon
their native &s;hores, where they &s;eem to take root at the feet of mountains;
and, as Martius tells us, are &s;ome|times higher than the mountains
them&s;elves. Tho&s;e &s;een by him were blue, full of clefts and cavities made
by the rain, and crowned with &s;now, which alternately thawing and freezing
every year, augmented their &s;ize. The&s;e, com|po&s;ed of materials more
&s;olid than that driving at &s;ea, pre&s;ented a variety of agreeable figures
to the eye, that, with a little help from fancy, a&s;&s;umed the appearance of
trees in blo&s;&s;om; the in&s;ide of churches, with arches, pillars, and
windows; and the blue coloured rays, darting from within, pre&s;ented the
re&s;emblance of a glory.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the origin and formation of the&s;e, which, as we
&s;ee, are very different from the former, I think we have a very
&s;a|tisfactory account of them in Krantz's Hi&s;tory <PB N="246" REF="269"> of
Greenland; and I will take leave to give the pa&s;&s;age, with a very few
alterations. 
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e mountains of ice," &s;ays he, "are not
&s;alt, like the &s;ea-water, but &s;weet; and, therefore, can be formed no
where except on the mountains, in rivers, in caverns, and again&s;t the hills
near the &s;ea-&s;hore. The mountains of Greenland are &s;o high, that the
&s;now which falls upon them, particularly on the north &s;ide, is, in one
night's time, wholly converted into ice: they al&s;o con|tain clefts and
cavities, where the &s;un &s;eldom or never injects his rays: be&s;ides
the&s;e, are pro|jections, or landing-places, on the declivities of the
&s;teepe&s;t hills, where the rain and &s;now-water lodge, and quickly congeal.
When now the accumulated flakes of &s;now &s;lide down, or fall with the rain
from the eminences above, on the&s;e prominences; or, when here and there a
mountain-&s;pring comes rolling down to &s;uch a lodging place, where the ice
has already &s;eated it&s;elf, they all freeze, and add their tribute to it.
This, by degrees, waxes to a body of ice, that can no more be overpowered by
the &s;un; and which, though it may indeed, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, dimini&s;h
by a thaw, yet, upon the whole, through annual acqui&s;itions, it a&s;&s;umes
an annual growth. Such a body of ice is often prominent far over 
<PB N="247" REF="270"> the rocks. It does not melt on the upper &s;ur|face, but
underneath; and al&s;o cracks into many larger or &s;maller clefts, from whence
the thawed water trickles out. By this it becomes, at la&s;t, &s;o weak, that
being overloaded with its own ponderous bulk, it breaks loo&s;e, and tumbles
down the rocks with a terrible cra&s;h. Where it happens to overhang a
precipice on the &s;hore, it plunges into the deep with a &s;hock like
thun|der; and with &s;uch an agitation of the water, as will over&s;et a boat
at &s;ome di&s;tance, as many a poor Greenlander has fatally experienced."</Q>
Thus are the&s;e amazing ice mountains launched forth to &s;ea, and found
floating in the waters round both the Poles. It is the&s;e that have hindered
mariners from di&s;covering the ex|ten&s;ive countries that lie round the South
Pole; and that probably block up the pa&s;&s;age to China by the North.</P>
<P>I will conclude this chapter with one effect more, produced by the
&s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea; which is, the luminous appearance of its waves in
the night. All who have been &s;pectators of a &s;ea by night, a little ruffled
with winds, &s;el|dom fail of ob&s;erving its fiery brightne&s;s. In 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. i. p. 294.</BIBL></NOTE>
&s;ome places it &s;hines as far as the eye can reach; <PB N="248" REF="271">
at other times, only when the waves boom again&s;t the &s;ide of the
ve&s;&s;el, or the oar da&s;hes into the water. Some &s;eas &s;hine often;
others more &s;eldom; &s;ome, ever when particular winds blow; and others,
within a narrow compa&s;s; a long tract of light being &s;een along the
&s;urface, whil&s;t all the re&s;t is hid in total darkne&s;s. It is not ea&s;y
to account for the&s;e extraordinary ap|pearances: &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed
that a number of luminous in&s;ects produced the effect, and this is in reality
&s;ometimes the ca&s;e; in general, however, they have every re&s;emblance to
that light produced by electricity; and, probably, ari&s;e from the agitation
and da&s;hing of the &s;aline particles of the fluid again&s;t each other. But
the manner in which this is done, for we can produce nothing &s;imilar, by any
experi|ments hitherto made, remains for &s;ome happier accident to di&s;cover.
Our progre&s;s in the knowledge of nature is &s;low; and it is a mor|tifying

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Tides, Motion, and Currents of the Sea; with
their Effects.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;aid in the former chapter, that the waters of the &s;ea
were kept &s;weet by their mo|tion; without which they would &s;oon putrefy,
and &s;pread univer&s;al infection. If we look for final cau&s;es, here,
indeed, we have a great and an obvious one that pre&s;ents it&s;elf before us.
Had the &s;ea been made without motion, and re&s;embling a pool of &s;tagnant
water, the nobler races of animated nature would &s;hortly be at an end.
Nothing would then be left alive but &s;warms of ill formed creatures, with
&s;carce more than vegetable life; and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by putre|faction. Were
this exten&s;ive bed of waters entirely quie&s;cent, millions of the &s;maller
reptile kinds would there find a proper retreat to breed and multiply in; they
would find there no agi|tations, no concu&s;&s;ion in the parts of the fluid to
cru&s;h their feeble frames, or to force them from the places where they were
bred: there they would multiply in &s;ecurity and ea&s;e, enjoy a &s;hort life,
and, putrefying, thus again give nouri&s;hment to numberle&s;s others, as
little <PB N="250" REF="273"> worthy of exi&s;tence as them&s;elves. But the
motion of this great element, effectually de&s;troys the number of the&s;e
viler creatures; its currents, and its tides, produce continual agitations, the
&s;hock of which they are not able to endure; the parts of the fluid rub
again&s;t each other, de&s;troy all vi&s;cidities; and the ocean, if I may &s;o
expre&s;s it, acquires health by exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious motion of the &s;ea, and the mo&s;t generally
acknowledged, is that of its tides. This element is ob&s;erved to flow for
certain hours, from &s;outh towards north; in which motion or flux, which
la&s;ts about &s;ix hours, the &s;ea gradually &s;wells; &s;o that entering the
mouths of rivers, it drives back the river waters to their heads. After a
continual flux of &s;ix hours, the &s;ea &s;eems to re&s;t for a quarter of an
hour; and then begins to ebb, or retire back again, from north to &s;outh, for
&s;ix hours more; in which time the waters &s;inking, the rivers re&s;ume their
natural cour&s;e. After a &s;eeming pau&s;e of a quarter of an hour, the &s;ea
again begins to flow as before: and thus it has alternately ri&s;en and fallen,
twice a day, &s;ince the creation.</P>
<P>This amazing appearance did not fail to ex|cite the curio&s;ity, as
it did the wonder of the ancients. After &s;ome wild conjectures of the 
<PB N="251" REF="274"> earlie&s;t philo&s;ophers, it became well known, in the
times of Pliny, that the tides were entirely under the influence, in a &s;mall
degree, of the &s;un; but in a much greater of the moon. It was found that
there was a flux and reflux of the &s;ea, in the &s;pace of twelve hours fifty
mi|nutes, which is exactly the time of a lunar day. It was ob&s;erved, that
whenever the moon was in the meridian, or, in other words, as nearly as
po&s;&s;ible over any part of the &s;ea, that the &s;ea flowed to that part,
and made a tide there; on the contrary, it was found, that when the moon left
the meridian, the &s;ea began to flow back again from whence it came; and there
might be &s;aid to ebb. Thus far the waters of the &s;ea &s;eemed very
regularly to attend the motions of the moon. But as it appeared, likewi&s;e,
that when the moon was in the oppo&s;ite meridian, as far off as po&s;&s;ible
on the other &s;ide of the globe, that there was a tide on this &s;ide al&s;o;
&s;o that the moon produced two tides, one by her greate&s;t approach to us,
and another by her greate&s;t di&s;tance from us: in other words, the moon, in
once going round the earth, pro|duced two tides, always at the &s;ame time; one
on the part of the globe directly under her; and the other, on the part of the
globe directly oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275">Mankind continued for &s;everal ages content
with knowing the general cau&s;e of the&s;e won|ders, hopele&s;s of
di&s;covering the particular manner of the moon's operation. Kepler was the
fir&s;t who conjectured that attraction was the principal cau&s;e;
a&s;&s;erting, that the &s;phere of the moon's operation extended to the earth,
and drew up its waters. The preci&s;e manner in which this is done, was
di&s;covered by Newton.</P>
<P>The moon has been found, like all the re&s;t of the planets, to
attract, and to be attracted by the earth. This attraction prevails throughout
our whole planetary &s;y&s;tem. The more matter there is contained in any body,
the more it at|tracts: and its influence decrea&s;es in proportion as the
di&s;tance, when &s;quared, encrea&s;es. This being premi&s;ed, let us &s;ee
what mu&s;t en&s;ue upon &s;uppo&s;ing the moon in the meridian of any tract of
the &s;ea. The &s;urface of the water im|mediately under the moon, is nearer
the moon than any other part of the globe is; and, therefore, mu&s;t be more
&s;ubject to its attraction than the waters any where el&s;e. The waters will,
therefore, be attracted by the moon, and ri&s;e in an heap; who&s;e eminence
will be the highe&s;t where the attraction is greate&s;t. In order to form this
eminence, it is obvious that <PB N="253" REF="276"> the &s;urface, as well as
the depths, will be agitated; and that wherever the water runs from one part,
&s;ucceeding waters mu&s;t run to fill up the &s;pace it has left. Thus the
waters of the &s;ea, running from all parts, to attend the mo|tions of the
moon, produce the flowing of the tide; and it is high tide at that part
wherever the moon comes over it, or into its meridian.</P>
<P>But when the moon travels onward, and cea&s;es to point over the
place where the waters were ju&s;t ri&s;en, the cau&s;e here of their ri&s;ing
cea&s;ing to operate, they will flow back by their natural gravity, into the
lower parts from whence they had travelled; and this retiring of the waters
will form the ebbing of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Thus the fir&s;t part of the demon&s;tration is obvious; &s;ince, in
general, it requires no great &s;agacity to conceive that the waters neare&s;t
the moon are mo&s;t attracted, or rai&s;ed highe&s;t by the moon. But the other
part of the demon|&s;tration, namely, how there come to be high tides at the
&s;ame time, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe, and where the waters are
farthe&s;t from the moon, is not &s;o ea&s;y to conceive. To comprehend this,
it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the part of the earth, and its waters, that are
farthe&s;t from the moon, are the parts of all others that 
<PB N="254" REF="277"> are lea&s;t attracted by the moon: it mu&s;t al&s;o be
ob&s;erved, that all the waters, when the moon is on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of
the earth, mu&s;t be at|tracted by it in the &s;ame direction that the earth
it&s;elf attracts them; that is, if I may &s;o &s;ay, quite through the body of
the earth, towards the moon it&s;elf. This, therefore, being con|ceived, it is
plain that tho&s;e waters which are farthe&s;t from the moon, will have le&s;s
weight than tho&s;e of any other part, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the globe;
becau&s;e the moon's attraction, which con&s;pires with the earth's attraction,
is there lea&s;t. Now, therefore, the waters farthe&s;t from the moon, having
le&s;s weight, and being lighte&s;t, will be pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, by
tho&s;e that, having more attraction, are heavier: they will be pre&s;&s;ed, I
&s;ay, on all &s;ides; and the heavier waters flowing in, will make them
&s;well and ri&s;e in an eminence directly oppo&s;ite to that on the other
&s;ide of the globe, cau&s;ed by the more immediate influence of the moon.</P>
<P>In this manner the moon, in one diurnal re|volution, produces two
tides; one rai&s;ed imme|diately under the &s;phere of its influence, and the
other directly oppo&s;ite to it. As the moon travels, this va&s;t body of
waters rears upward, as if to watch its motions; and pur&s;ues the &s;ame
con&s;tant rotation. However, in this great work <PB N="255" REF="278"> of
rai&s;ing the tides, the &s;un has no &s;mall &s;hare; it produces its own
tides con&s;tantly every day, ju&s;t as the moon does, but in a much le&s;s
degree, becau&s;e the &s;un is at an immen&s;ely greater di|&s;tance. Thus
there are &s;olar tides, and lunar tides. When the forces of the&s;e two great
lu|minaries concur, which they always do when they are either in the &s;ame, or
in oppo&s;ite parts of the heavens, they jointly produce a much greater tide,
than when they are &s;o &s;ituated in the heavens, as each to make peculiar
tides of their own. To expre&s;s the very &s;ame thing technically; in the
conjunctions and oppo&s;itions of the &s;un and moon, the attraction of the
&s;un con&s;pires with the attraction of the moon; by which means the high
&s;pring-tides are formed. But in the quadratures of the &s;un and moon, the
water rai&s;ed by the one is depre&s;&s;ed by the other; and hence the lower
neap tides have their production. In a word, the tides are greate&s;t in the
&s;yzigies, and lea&s;t in the quadratures.</P>
<P>This theory well under&s;tood, and the a&s;tro|nomical terms
previou&s;ly known, it may readily be brought to explain the various
appearances of the tides, if the earth were covered with a deep &s;ea, and the
waters uninfluenced by &s;hoals, currents, &s;traits, or tempe&s;ts. But in
every part of the &s;ea, near the &s;hores, the geographer 
<PB N="256" REF="279"> mu&s;t come in to correct the calculations of the
a&s;tronomer. For, by rea&s;on of the &s;hallowne&s;s of &s;ome places, and the
narrowne&s;s of the &s;traits in others, there ari&s;es a great diver&s;ity in
the effect, not to be accounted for without an exact knowledge of all the
circum&s;tances of the place. In the great depths of the ocean, for in&s;tance,
a very &s;low and imperceptible motion of the whole body of water will
&s;uffice to rai&s;e its &s;ur|face &s;everal feet high; but if the &s;ame
encrea&s;e of water is to be conveyed through a narrow channel, it mu&s;t
ru&s;h through it with the mo&s;t impetuous rapidity. Thus in the Engli&s;h
channel, and the German ocean, the tide is found to flow &s;tronge&s;t in
tho&s;e places that are narrowe&s;t; the &s;ame quantity of water being, in
this ca&s;e, to be driven through a &s;maller pa&s;|&s;age. It is often &s;een,
therefore, pouring through a &s;treight with great force; and, by its rapidity,
con&s;iderably rai&s;ed above the &s;urface of that part of the ocean into
which it runs.</P>
<P>This &s;hallowne&s;s and narrowne&s;s in many parts of the &s;ea,
give al&s;o ri&s;e to a peculiarity in the tides of &s;ome parts of the world.
For in many places, and in our own &s;eas in par|ticular, the greate&s;t
&s;well of the tide is not while the moon is at its meridian height, and
directly over the place, but &s;ome time after it <PB N="257" REF="280"> has
declined from thence. The &s;ea, in this ca&s;e, being ob&s;tructed, pur&s;ues
the moon with what di&s;patch it can, but does not arrive with all its waters
till long after the moon has cea&s;ed to operate. La&s;tly, from this
&s;hallowne&s;s of the &s;ea, and from its being ob&s;tructed by &s;hoals and
&s;treights, we may account for the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Black
Sea, having no &s;en|&s;ible tides. The&s;e, though to us they &s;eem very
exten&s;ive, are not however large enough to be affected by the influence of
the moon; and as to their communication with the ocean, that is through &s;uch
narrow inlets, that it is impo&s;&s;ible in a few hours time that they &s;hould
receive and return water enough to rai&s;e or depre&s;s them in any
con&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P>In general, therefore, we may ob&s;erve, that all tides are much
higher, and more con&s;iderable in the torrid zone, than in the re&s;t of the
ocean; the &s;ea in tho&s;e parts being generally deeper, and le&s;s affected
by changeable winds, or winding &s;hores<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
vol. ii. p. 187.</BIBL></NOTE>. The greate&s;t tide we know of, is that at the
mouth of the river Indus, where the water ri&s;es thirty feet in height. How
great, there|fore, mu&s;t have been the amazement of Alex|ander's &s;oldiers at
&s;o &s;trange an appearance! They who always before had been accu&s;tomed 
<PB N="258" REF="281"> only to the &s;carcely perceptible ri&s;ings of the
Mediterranean, or the minute intume&s;cence of the Black Sea, when made at once
&s;pectators of a river ri&s;ing and falling thirty feet in a few hours, mu&s;t
no doubt have felt the mo&s;t extreme awe, and, as we are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Quintius Curtius.</BIBL></NOTE>, a mixture of
curio&s;ity and apprehen&s;ion. The tides are al&s;o remarkably high on the
coa&s;ts of Malay, in the &s;treights of Sunda, in the Red Sea, at the mouth of
the river St. Lawrence, along the coa&s;ts of China and Japan, at Panama, and
in the gulph of Bengal. The tides at Tonquin, however, are the mo&s;t
remarkable in the world. In this part there is but one tide, and one ebb, in
twenty-four hours; whereas, as we have &s;aid before, in other places there are
two. Be&s;ides, there, twice in each month there is no tide at all, when the
moon is near the equinoctial, the water being for &s;ome time quite &s;tagnant.
The&s;e, with &s;ome other odd appearances attending the &s;ame phae|nomena,
were con&s;idered by many as in&s;cru|table; but Sir I&s;aac Newton, with
peculiar &s;a|gacity, adjudged them to ari&s;e from the concur|rence of two
tides, one from the South Sea, and the other from the Indian Ocean. Of each of
the&s;e tides there come &s;ucce&s;&s;ively two every day; two at one time
greater, and two at another <PB N="259" REF="282"> that are le&s;s. The time
between the arrival of the two greater, is con&s;idered by him as high tide;
the time between the two le&s;&s;er, as ebb. In &s;hort, with this clue, that
great mathematician &s;olved every appearance, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed his
theory as to &s;ilence every oppo&s;er.</P>
<P>This fluctuation of the &s;ea from the tides, produces another, and
more con&s;tant rotation of its waters, from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, in this
re|&s;pect following the cour&s;e of the moon. This may be con&s;idered as one
great and general current of the waters of the &s;ea; and although it be not
every where di&s;tingui&s;hable, it is ne|verthele&s;s every where exi&s;tent,
except when op|po&s;ed by &s;ome particular current or eddy, pro|duced by
partial and local cau&s;es. This ten|dency of the &s;ea towards the we&s;t, is
plainly perceivable in all the great &s;treights of the ocean; as, for
in&s;tance, in tho&s;e of Magellan; where the tide running in from the ea&s;t,
ri&s;es twenty feet high, and continues flowing &s;ix hours; whereas the ebb
continues but two hours, and the current is directed to the we&s;t. This proves
that the flux is not equal to the reflux; and that from both re&s;ults a motion
of the &s;ea we&s;tward, which is more powerful during the time of the flux
than the reflux.</P>
<P>But this motion we&s;tward has been &s;en&s;ibly 
<PB N="260" REF="283"> ob&s;erved by navigators, in their pa&s;&s;age back from
India to Madaga&s;car, and &s;o on to Africa. In the great Pacific Ocean
al&s;o, it is very per|ceivable: but the places where it is mo&s;t ob|vious
are, as was &s;aid, in tho&s;e &s;treights which join one ocean to another. In
the &s;treights be|tween the Maldivia i&s;lands, in the gulph of Mexico,
between Cuba and Jucatan. In the &s;treights of the gulph of Paria, the motion
is &s;o violent that it hath received the appellation of the Dragon's Mouth.
Northward, in the &s;ea of Canada, in Waigat's &s;treights, in the &s;treights
of Java, and, in &s;hort, in every &s;treight where the ocean on one part pours
into the ocean on the other. In this manner, therefore, is the &s;ea carried
with an uncea&s;ing circulation round the globe; and, at the &s;ame time that
its waters are pu&s;hed back and forward with the tide, they have thus a
progre&s;&s;ive current to the we&s;t, which, though le&s;s ob&s;ervable, is
not the le&s;s real.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two general motions of the &s;ea, there are others
which are particular to many parts of it, and are called currents. The&s;e are
found to run in all directions, ea&s;t, we&s;t, north, and &s;outh; being
formed, as was &s;aid above, by various cau&s;es; the prominence of the
&s;hores, the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treigths, the variations of 
<PB N="261" REF="284"> the wind, and the inequalities at the bottom. The&s;e,
though no great object to the philo&s;o|pher, as their cau&s;es are generally
local and ob|vious, are neverthele&s;s of the mo&s;t material con|&s;equence to
the mariner; and, without a know|ledge of which, he could never &s;ucceed. It
often has happened, that when a &s;hip has un|knowingly got into one of
the&s;e, every thing &s;eems to go forward with &s;ucce&s;s, the mariners
&s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves every hour approaching their wi&s;h'd-for port, the
wind fills their &s;ails, and the &s;hip's prow &s;eems to divide the water;
but, at la&s;t, by mi&s;erable experience they find, that in&s;tead of going
forward, they have been all the time receding. The bu&s;ine&s;s of currents,
there|fore, makes a con&s;iderable article in navigation; and the direction of
their &s;tream, and their ra|pidity, has been carefully &s;et down. This &s;ome
do by the ob&s;ervation of the &s;urface of the cur|rent; or by the driving of
the froth along the &s;hore; or by throwing out what is called the log-line,
with a buoy made for that purpo&s;e, and by the direction and motion of this,
they judge of the &s;etting, and the rapidity of the current.</P>
<P>The&s;e currents are generally found to be mo&s;t violent under the
equator, where indeed all the motions of the ocean are mo&s;t perceivable. 
<PB N="262" REF="285"> Along the coa&s;ts of Guinea, if a &s;hip happens to
over&s;hoot the mouth of any river it is bound to, the current prevents its
return; &s;o that it is obliged to &s;teer out to &s;ea, and take a very large
compa&s;s, in order to correct the former mi&s;take. The&s;e &s;et in a
contrary direction to the general motion of the &s;ea we&s;tward; and that &s;o
&s;trong|ly, that a pa&s;&s;age which with the current is gone in two days, is
with difficulty performed in &s;ix weeks again&s;t it. However, they do not
extend above twenty leagues from the coa&s;t; and &s;hips going to the
Ea&s;t-Indies, take care not to come within the &s;phere of their action. At
Sumatra, the currents, which are extremely rapid, run from &s;outh to north:
there are al&s;o &s;trong cur|rents between Madaga&s;car and the Cape of Good
Hope. On the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Ame|rica, the current always runs from the
&s;outh to the north, where a &s;outh wind, continually blowing, mo&s;t
probably occa&s;ions this phaeno|mena. But the currents that are mo&s;t
remark|able, are tho&s;e continually flowing into the Me|diterranean &s;ea,
both from the ocean by the &s;treights of Gibraltar, and at its other
ex|tremity, from the Euxine &s;ea by the Archipe|lago. This is one of the
mo&s;t extraordinary appearances in nature, this large &s;ea receiving not only
the numerous rivers that fall into it, <PB N="263" REF="286"> &s;uch as the
Nile, the Rhone, and the Po, but al&s;o a very great influx from the Euxine
&s;ea on one part, and the ocean on the other. At the &s;ame time, it is &s;een
to return none of tho&s;e waters it is thus known to receive: outlets run|ning
from it there are none; no rivers but &s;uch as bring it fre&s;h &s;upplies; no
&s;treights but what are con&s;tantly pouring their waters into it: it has
therefore been the wonder of mankind in every age, how, and by what means this
va&s;t concour&s;e of waters are di&s;po&s;ed of; or how this &s;ea, which is
always receiving, and never re|turning, is no way fuller than before. In order
to account for this, &s;ome have &s;aid, that the water was re-conveyed by
&s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages into the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. There is a
&s;tory told of an Arabian califf, who caught a dolphin in this &s;ea,
admir|ing the beauty of which, he let it go again, hav|ing previou&s;ly marked
it by a ring of iron. Some time after a dolphin was caught in the Red Sea, and
quickly known by the ring to be the &s;ame that had been taken in the
Mediterranean be|fore. Such, however, as have not been willing to found their
opinions upon a &s;tory, have at|tempted to account for the di&s;po&s;al of the
waters of the Mediterranean by evaporation. For this purpo&s;e they have
entered into long calculations <PB N="264" REF="287"> upon the extent of its
&s;urface, and the quantity of water that would be rai&s;ed from &s;uch a
&s;ur|face in a year. They then compute how much water runs in by its rivers
and &s;treights in that time; and find, that the quantity exhau&s;ted by
evaporation, greatly exceeds the quantity &s;up|plied by rivers and &s;eas. And
this &s;olution, no doubt would be &s;atisfactory, did not the ocean, and the
Euxine, evaporate as well as the Mediterranean: and as the&s;e are &s;ubject to
the &s;ame drain, it mu&s;t follow, that all the &s;eas will in this re&s;pect
be upon a par; and, there|fore, there mu&s;t be &s;ome other cau&s;e for this
unperceived drain, and continual &s;upply. This &s;eems to be &s;atisfactorily
enough accounted for by Doctor Smith, who &s;uppo&s;es an under current running
through the &s;treights of Gi|braltar to carry out as much water into the
ocean, as the upper current continually carries in from it. To confirm this, he
ob&s;erves, that nearer home, between the north and &s;outh foreland, the tide
is known to run one way at top, and the ebb another way at bottom. This double
cur|rent he al&s;o confirms by an experiment commu|nicated to him by an able
&s;eaman, who being with one of the king's frigates in the Baltic, found he
went with his boat into the mid-&s;tream, and was carried violently by the
current; upon which a ba&s;ket was &s;unk, with a large cannon|ball, 
<PB N="265" REF="288"> to a certain depth of water, which gave a check to the
boat's motion; as the ba&s;ket &s;unk &s;till lower, the boat was driven, by
the force of the water below, again&s;t the upper current; and the lower the
ba&s;ket was let down, the &s;tronger the under current was found, and the
quicker was the boat's motion again&s;t the upper &s;tream, which &s;eemed not
to be above four fathom deep. From hence we may readily infer, that the &s;ame
cau&s;e may operate at the &s;treights of Gibraltar; and that while the
Mediterranean &s;eems repleni&s;hing at top, it may be emptying at bottom.</P>
<P>The number of the currents at &s;ea are im|po&s;&s;ible to be
recounted, nor indeed are they always known; new ones are daily produced by a
variety of cau&s;es, and as quickly di&s;appear. When a regular current is
oppo&s;ed by another in a narrow &s;treight, or where the bottom of the &s;ea
is very uneven, a whirlpool is often formed. The&s;e were formerly con&s;idered
as the mo&s;t formidable ob&s;tructions to navigation, and the ancient poets
and hi&s;torians &s;peak of them with terror; they are de&s;cribed as
&s;wallowing up &s;hips, and da&s;hing them again&s;t the rocks at the bottom:
apprehen&s;ion did not fail to add ima|ginary terrors to the de&s;cription, and
placed at the center of the whirlpool a dreadful den, <PB N="266" REF="289">
fraught with mon&s;ters who&s;e howlings &s;erved to add new horrors to the
da&s;hings of the deep. Mankind at pre&s;ent, however, view the&s;e eddies of
the &s;ea with very little apprehen&s;ion; and &s;ome have wondered how the
ancients could have &s;o much overcharged their de&s;criptions. But all this is
very naturally accounted for. In tho&s;e times when navigation was as yet but
be|ginning, and the &s;lighte&s;t concu&s;&s;ion of the waves generally &s;ent
the poor adventurer to the bottom, it is not to be wondered at that he was
terrified at the violent agitations in one of the&s;e. When his little &s;hip,
but ill fitted for oppo&s;ing the fury of the &s;ea, was got within the vortex,
there was then no po&s;&s;ibility of ever returning. To add to the fatality,
they were always near the &s;hore; and along the &s;hore was the only place
where this ill provided mariner dur&s;t ven|ture to &s;ail. The&s;e were,
therefore, dreadful im|pediments to his navigation; for if he attempted to
pa&s;s between them and the &s;hore, he was &s;ometimes &s;ucked in by the
eddy; and if he at|tempted to avoid them out at &s;ea, he was often &s;unk by
the &s;torm. But in our time, and in our pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of
navigation, Charyb|dis, and the Euripus, with all the other irre|gular currents
of the Mediterranean, are no longer formidable. Mr. Addi&s;on not attending 
<PB N="267" REF="290"> to this train of thinking, upon pa&s;&s;ing through the
&s;treights of Sicily, was &s;urpri&s;ed at the little there was of terror in
the pre&s;ent appearance of Sylla and Charybdis; and &s;eems to be of opi|nion,
that their agitations are much dimini&s;hed &s;ince the times of antiquity. In
fact, from the rea&s;ons above, all the wonders of the Mediter|ranean &s;ea are
de&s;cribed in much higher colours than they merit, to us who are acquainted
with the more magnificent terrors of the ocean. The Mediterranean is one of the
&s;moothe&s;t and mo&s;t gentle &s;eas in the world; its tides are &s;carce
per|ceivable, except in the gulph of Venice, and &s;hipwrecks are le&s;s known
there than in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>It is in the ocean, therefore, that the&s;e whirl|pools are
particularly dangerous, where the tides are violent, and the tempe&s;ts fierce.
To mention only one, that called the Mael&s;troom, upon the coa&s;ts of Norway,
which is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t dreadful and voracious in the world. The
name it has received from the natives, &s;ig|nifies the navel of the &s;ea,
&s;ince they &s;uppo&s;e that a great &s;hare of the water of the &s;ea is
&s;ucked up and di&s;charged by its vortex. A minute de|&s;cription of the
internal parts is not to be ex|pected, &s;ince none who were there ever
re|turned to bring back information. The body <PB N="268" REF="291"> of the
waters that form this whirlpool, are ex|tended in a circle above thirteen miles
in cir|cumference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i. p.
156.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the mid&s;t of this &s;tands a rock, again&s;t which the
tide in its ebb is da&s;hed with inconceivable fury. At this time it
in|&s;tantly &s;wallows up all things that come within the &s;phere of its
violence, trees, timber, and &s;hipping. No &s;kill in the mariner, nor
&s;trength of rowing, can work an e&s;cape: the &s;ailor at the helm finds the
&s;hip at fir&s;t go in a current op|po&s;ite to his intentions; his
ve&s;&s;el's motion, tho' &s;low in the beginning, becomes every moment more
rapid; it goes round in circles &s;till narrower and narrower, till at la&s;t
it is da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks, and in&s;tantly di&s;appears: nor is it
&s;een again for &s;ix hours: till the tide flowing, it is vomited forth with
the &s;ame violence with which it was drawn in. The noi&s;e of this dreadful
vortex &s;till farther contributes to en|crea&s;e its terror, which with the
da&s;hing of the waters, and the dreadful valley, if it may be &s;o called,
cau&s;ed by their circulation, makes one of the mo&s;t tremendous objects in
nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Changes produced by the Sea upon the
Earth.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, as well of the earth as of the &s;ea,
they both appear to be in continual fluctuation. The earth, the common
promptuary that &s;upplies &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to men, animals, and vegetables,
is continually furni&s;h|ing its &s;tores to their &s;upport. But the matter
which is thus derived from it, is &s;oon re&s;tored and laid down again to be
prepared for fre&s;h mu|tations. The tran&s;migration of &s;ouls is no doubt
fal&s;e and whim&s;ical; but nothing can be more certain than the
tran&s;migration of bodies: the &s;poils of the meane&s;t reptile may go to the
for|mation of a prince; and, on the contrary, as the poet has it, the body of
Cae&s;ar may be em|ployed in &s;topping a beer barrel. From this, and other
cau&s;es, therefore, the earth is in con|tinual change. Its internal fires, the
deviation of its rivers, and the falling of its mountains, are daily altering
its &s;urface; and geography can &s;carce recollect the lakes and the vallies
that hi&s;tory once de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But the&s;e changes are nothing to the in&s;ta|bility 
<PB N="270" REF="293"> of the ocean. It would &s;eem that inqui|etude was as
natural to it as its fluidity. It is fir&s;t &s;een with a con&s;tant and
equable motion going towards the we&s;t; the tides then interrupt this
progre&s;&s;ion, and for a time drive the waters in a contrary direction;
be&s;ide the&s;e agitations, the currents act their part in a &s;maller
&s;phere, being generally greate&s;t where the other motions of the &s;ea are
lea&s;t; namely, neare&s;t the &s;hore: the winds al&s;o contribute their
&s;hare in this uni|ver&s;al fluctuation; &s;o that &s;carce any part of the
&s;ea is wholly &s;een to &s;tagnate.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Nil enim quie&s;cit, undis impellitur unda,</L> 
<L>Et &s;piritus et calor toto &s;e corpore mi&s;cent.</L></Q>
<P>As this great element is thus changed, and continually labouring
internally, it may be rea|dily &s;uppo&s;ed that it produces corre&s;pondent
changes upon its &s;hores, and tho&s;e parts of the earth &s;ubject to its
influence. In fact, it is every day making con&s;iderable alterations, either
by overflowing its &s;hores in one place, or de|&s;erting them in others; by
covering over whole tracts of country, that were cultivated and peo|pled, at
one time; or by leaving its bed to be ap|propriated to the purpo&s;es of
vegetation, and to &s;upply a new theatre for human indu&s;try at another.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="294">In this &s;truggle between the earth and the
&s;ea for dominion, the greate&s;t number of our &s;hores &s;eem to defy the
whole rage of the waves, both by their height, and the rocky materials of which
they are compo&s;ed. The coa&s;ts of Italy, for in&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 199.</BIBL></NOTE>, are bordered with
rocks of mar|ble of different kinds, the quarries of which may ea&s;ily be
di&s;tingui&s;hed at a di&s;tance from &s;ea, and appear like perpendicular
columns, of the mo&s;t beautiful kinds of marble, ranged along the &s;hore. In
general, the coa&s;ts of France, from Bre&s;t to Bourdeaux, are compo&s;ed of
rocks; as are al&s;o tho&s;e of Spain and England, which defend the land, and
only are interrupted here and there to give an egre&s;s to rivers, and to grant
the conveniences of bays and harbours to our &s;hipping. It may be in general
re|marked, that wherever the &s;ea is mo&s;t violent and furious, there the
bolde&s;t &s;hores, and of the mo&s;t compact materials, are found to oppo&s;e
it. There are many &s;hores &s;everal hundred feet perpendicular, again&s;t
which the &s;ea, when &s;wollen with tides or &s;torms, ri&s;es and beats with
inconceivable fury. In 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Idem, vol. ii. p.
191.</BIBL></NOTE> the Ork|neys, where the &s;hores are thus formed, it
&s;ome|times, when agitated by a &s;torm, ri&s;es two hun|dred feet
perpendicular, and da&s;hes up its &s;pray, <PB N="272" REF="295"> together
with &s;and, and other &s;ub&s;tances that compo&s;e its bottom, upon land,
like &s;howers of rain.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, we may conceive how the violence of the
&s;ea, and the boldne&s;s of the &s;hore, may be &s;aid to have made each
other. Where the &s;ea meets no ob&s;tacles, it &s;preads its waters with a
gentle intume&s;cence, till all its power is de&s;troyed, by its wanting depth
to aid its motion. But when its progre&s;s is checked in the mid&s;t, by the
prominence of rocks, or the abrupt elevation of the land, it da&s;hes with all
the force of its depth again&s;t the ob&s;tacle, and forms, by its repeated
violence, that abruptne&s;s of the &s;hore which confines its impetuo&s;ity.
Where the &s;ea is extremely deep, or very much vexed by tempe&s;ts, it is no
&s;mall ob&s;tacle that can confine its rage; and for this rea&s;on we &s;ee
the bolde&s;t &s;hores projected again&s;t the deepe&s;t waters; all le&s;s
impediments having long before been &s;ur|mounted and wa&s;hed away. Perhaps of
all the &s;hores in the world, there is not one &s;o high as that to the we&s;t
of St. Kilda, which, upon a late admea&s;urement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De&s;cription of St. Kilda.</BIBL></NOTE>, was found to be
&s;ix hun|dred fathom perpendicular above the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Here
al&s;o, the &s;ea is deep, turbulent, <PB N="273" REF="296"> and &s;tormy; &s;o
that it requires great force in the &s;hore to oppo&s;e its violence. In many
parts of the world, and particularly upon the coa&s;ts of the Ea&s;t Indies,
the &s;hores, though not high above water, are generally very deep, and
con|&s;equently the waves roll again&s;t land with great weight and
irregularity. This ri&s;ing of the waves again&s;t the &s;hore, is called by
mariners, the &s;urf of the &s;ea; and in &s;hipwrecks is generally fatal to
&s;uch as attempt to &s;wim on &s;hore. In this ca&s;e, no dexterity in the
&s;wimmer, no float he can u&s;e, neither &s;wimming girdle nor cork jacket
will &s;ave him; the weight of the &s;uperincumbent wave breaks upon him at
once, and cru&s;hes him with certain ruin. Some few of the natives, however,
have the art of &s;wimming and of navigating their little boats near tho&s;e
&s;hores, where an European is &s;ure of in&s;tant de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>In places where the force of the &s;ea is le&s;s violent, or its
tides le&s;s rapid, the &s;hores are ge|nerally &s;een to de&s;cend with a more
gradual declivity. Over the&s;e, the waters of the tide &s;teal by almo&s;t
imperceptible degrees, covering them for a large extent, and leaving them bare
on its rece&s;s. Upon the&s;e &s;hores, as was &s;aid, the &s;ea &s;eldom beats
with any great violence, as a large wave has not depth &s;ufficient to float it
<PB N="274" REF="297"> onwards, &s;o that here only are to be &s;een gentle
&s;urges making calmly towards land, and le&s;&s;en|ing as they approach. As
the &s;ea, in the for|mer de&s;cription, is generally &s;een to pre&s;ent
pro&s;pects of tumult, and uproar, here it more u&s;ually exhibits a &s;cene of
repo&s;e and tranquil beauty. Its waters, which when &s;urveyed from the
precipice, afforded a muddy greeni&s;h hue, ari&s;ing from their depth and
po&s;ition to the eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Newton's Optics, p.
163-167.</BIBL></NOTE>, when regarded from a &s;helving &s;hore, wear the
colour of the &s;ky, and &s;eem ri&s;ing to meet it. The deafening noi&s;e of
the deep &s;ea, is here converted into gentle murmurs; in&s;tead of the water's
da&s;hing again&s;t the face of the rock, it advances and recedes, &s;till
going for|ward, but with ju&s;t force enough to pu&s;h its weeds and &s;hells,
by in&s;en&s;ible approaches, to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>There are &s;till other &s;hores, be&s;ide tho&s;e al|ready
de&s;cribed, which either have been rai&s;ed by art to oppo&s;e the &s;ea's
approaches, or from the &s;ea's gaining ground, are threatened with imminent
de&s;truction. The &s;ea's being thus &s;een to give and take away lands at
plea&s;ure, is, without que&s;tion, one of the mo&s;t extraordinary
con&s;iderations in all natural hi&s;tory. In &s;ome places it is &s;een to
obtain the &s;uperiority by &s;low and certain approaches; or to bur&s;t in at
once, <PB N="275" REF="298"> and overwhelm all things in undi&s;tingui&s;hed
de&s;truction; in other places it departs from its &s;hores, and where its
waters have been known to rage, it leaves fields covered with the mo&s;t
beautiful verdure.</P>
<P>The formation of new lands by the &s;ea's con|tinually bringing its
&s;ediment to one place, and by the accumulation of its &s;ands in another, is
ea&s;ily conceived. We have had many in&s;tances of this in England. The
i&s;land of Oxney, which is adjacent to Romney-mar&s;h, was produced in this
manner. This had for a long time been a low level, continually in danger of
being overflown by the river Rother; but the &s;ea, by its depo|&s;itions, has
gradually rai&s;ed the bottom of the river, while it has hollowed the mouth;
&s;o that the one is &s;ufficiently &s;ecured from inundations, and the other
is deep enough to admit &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen. The like al&s;o may
be &s;een at that bank called the Dogger-&s;ands, where two tides meet, and
which thus receive new increa&s;e every day, &s;o that in time the place
&s;eems to pro|mi&s;e fair for being habitable earth. On many parts of the
coa&s;ts of France, England, Holland, Germany, and Pru&s;&s;ia, the &s;ea has
been &s;en&s;ibly known to retire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
vi. p. 424.</BIBL></NOTE>. Hubert Thomas a&s;&s;erts, in his De&s;cription of
the Country of Liege, that the <PB N="276" REF="299"> &s;ea formerly
encompa&s;&s;ed the city of Tongres, which, however, is at pre&s;ent
thirty-five leagues di&s;tant from it: this a&s;&s;ertion he &s;upports by many
&s;trong rea&s;ons; and among others, by the iron rings fixed in the walls of
the town, for fa&s;tening the &s;hips that came into the port. In Italy there
is a con&s;iderable piece of ground gained at the mouth of the river Arno; and
Ra|venna, that once &s;tood by the &s;ea-&s;ide is now con&s;iderably removed
from the &s;ame. But we need &s;carce mention the&s;e, when we find that the
whole kingdom of Holland &s;eems to be a conque&s;t upon the &s;ea, and in a
manner re&s;|cued from its bo&s;om. The &s;urface of the earth, in this
country, is below the level of the bed of the &s;ea; and I remember, upon
approaching the coa&s;t, to have looked down upon it from the &s;ea, as into a
valley; however, it is every day ri&s;ing higher by the depo&s;itions made upon
it, both by the &s;ea, the Rhine, and the Meu&s;e; and tho&s;e parts which
formerly admitted large men of war, are now known to be too &s;hallow to
receive &s;hips of very moderate burthen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
vol. vi. p. 424.</BIBL></NOTE>. The province of Jucatan, a penin&s;ula in the
gulph of Mexico, was formerly a part of the &s;ea: this tract, which
&s;tretches out into the ocean an hundred leagues, and which is above thirty 
<PB N="277" REF="300"> broad, is every where, at a moderate depth below the
&s;urface, compo&s;ed of &s;hells, which evince that its land once formed the
bed of the &s;ea. In France, the town of Aigues Mortes was a port in the times
of St. Louis, which is now removed more than four miles from the &s;ea.
P&s;almodi, in the &s;ame kingdom, was an i&s;land in the year 815, but is now
more than &s;ix miles from the &s;hore. All along the coa&s;ts of Norfolk, I am
very well a&s;&s;ured, that in the me|mory of man, the &s;ea has gained fifty
yards in &s;ome places, and has lo&s;t as much in others.</P>
<P>Thus numerous, therefore, are the in&s;tances of new lands having
been produced from the &s;ea, which, as we &s;ee, is brought about two
dif|ferent ways: fir&s;t, by the waters rai&s;ing banks of &s;and and mud where
their &s;ediment is depo&s;ited; and &s;econdly, by their relinqui&s;hing the
&s;hore entirely, and leaving it unoccupied to the indu|&s;try of man.</P>
<P>But as the &s;ea has been thus known to recede from &s;ome lands,
&s;o has it, by fatal experience, been found to encroach upon others: and,
pro|bably, the&s;e depredations on one part of the &s;hore, may account for
their dereliction from another; for the current which re&s;ted upon &s;ome
certain bank, having got an egre&s;s in &s;ome other place, it no longer
pre&s;&s;es upon its former bed, <PB N="278" REF="301"> but pours all its
&s;tream into the new entrance, &s;o that every inundation of the &s;ea may be
at|tended with &s;ome corre&s;pondent dereliction of another &s;hore.</P>
<P>However this be, we have numerous hi&s;tories of the &s;ea's
inundations, and its burying whole provinces in its bo&s;om. Many countries
that have been thus de&s;troyed, &s;till bear melancholy witne&s;s to the truth
of hi&s;tory; and &s;hew the tops of their hou&s;es, and the &s;pires of their
&s;teeples, &s;till &s;tanding at the bottom of the water. One of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable inundations we have in hi&s;tory, is that which happened in the
reign of Henry I. which overflowed the e&s;tates of the Earl Godwin, and forms
now that bank called the Goodwin &s;ands. In the year 1546, a &s;imilar
irruption of the &s;ea de&s;troyed an hun|dred thou&s;and per&s;ons in the
territory of Dort; and yet a greater number round Dullart. In Friezland, and
Zealand, there were more than three hundred villages overwhelmed; and their
remains continue &s;till vi&s;ible at the bottom of the water in a clear day.
The Baltic &s;ea has, by &s;low degrees, covered a large part of Pome|rania;
and, among others, de&s;troyed and over|whelmed the famous port of Vineta. In
the &s;ame manner, the Norwegian &s;ea has formed &s;everal little i&s;lands
from the main land, and &s;till <PB N="279" REF="302"> daily advances upon the
continent. The Ger|man &s;ea has advanced upon the &s;hores of Hol|land, near
Catt, &s;o that the ruins of an ancient citadel of the Romans, which was
formerly built upon this coa&s;t, are now actually under water. To the&s;e
accidents &s;everal more might be added; our own hi&s;torians, and tho&s;e of
other countries, abound with them; almo&s;t every flat &s;hore of any extent,
being able to &s;hew &s;omething that it has lo&s;t, or &s;omething that it has
gained from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;hores on which the &s;ea has made temporary
depredations; where it has overflowed, and after remaining perhaps &s;ome ages,
it has again retired of its own accord, or been driven back by the indu&s;try
of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 425.</BIBL></NOTE>.
There are many lands in Norway, Scotland, and the Maldivia i&s;lands, that are
at one time co|vered with water, and at another free. The country round the
I&s;le of Ely, in the times of Bede, about a thou&s;and years ago, was one of
the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots in the whole kingdom. It was not only richly
cultivated, and produced all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but grapes al&s;o
that afforded the mo&s;t excellent wine. The accounts of that time are copious
in the de&s;cription of its verdure and fertility; its rich pa&s;tures, covered
<PB N="280" REF="303"> with flowers and herbage; its beautiful &s;hades, and
whol&s;ome air. But the &s;ea breaking in, upon the land, overwhelmed the whole
country, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oil, and totally de&s;troyed one of
the mo&s;t beautiful vallies in the world. Its air, from being dry and
healthful, from that time became mo&s;t unwhol&s;ome, and clogged with vapours;
and the &s;mall part of the country that, by being higher than the re&s;t,
e&s;caped the deluge, was &s;oon rendered uninhabitable, from its noxious
vapours. Thus this country conti|nued under water for &s;ome centuries; till,
at la&s;t, the &s;ea, by the &s;ame caprice which had prompted its inva&s;ions,
began to abandon the the earth in like manner. It has continued for &s;ome ages
to relinqui&s;h its former conque&s;ts; and although the inhabitants can
neither boa&s;t the longevity, nor the luxuries of their former pre-occupants,
yet they find ample means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and if they happen to &s;urvive
the fir&s;t years of their re&s;idence there, they are often known to arrive at
a good old age.</P>
<P>But although hi&s;tory be &s;ilent as to many other inundations of
the like kind, where the &s;ea has overflowed the country, and afterwards
retired, yet we have numberle&s;s te&s;timonies of another nature, that prove
it beyond the po&s;&s;i|bility of doubt: I mean tho&s;e numerous trees that are
found buried at con&s;iderable depths <PB N="281" REF="304"> in places where
either rivers, or the &s;ea, has accidentally overflown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 403.</BIBL></NOTE>. At the mouth of the
river Ne&s;s, near Bruges, in Flanders, at the depth of fifty feet, are found
great quantities of trees lying as clo&s;e to each other as they do in a wood:
the trunks, the branches, and the leaves, are in &s;uch perfect pre&s;ervation,
that the particular kind of each tree may in&s;tantly be known. About five
hundred years ago, this very ground was known to have been covered with the
&s;ea; nor is there any hi&s;tory or tradition of its having been dry ground,
which we can have no doubt mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e. Thus we &s;ee a country
flouri&s;hing in verdure, pro|ducing large fore&s;ts, and trees of various
kinds, overwhelmed by the &s;ea. We &s;ee this element depo&s;iting its
&s;ediment to an heighth of fifty feet; and its waters mu&s;t, therefore, have
ri&s;en much higher. We &s;ee the &s;ame, after it has thus overwhelmed, and
&s;unk the land &s;o deep beneath its &s;lime, capriciou&s;ly retiring from the
&s;ame coa&s;ts, and leaving that habi|table once more, which it had formerly
de|&s;troyed. All this is wonderful; and perhaps, in&s;tead of attempting to
enquire after the cau&s;e, which has hitherto been in&s;crutable, it will
be&s;t become us to re&s;t &s;atisfied with ad|miration.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="305">At the city of Modena in Italy, and about four
miles round it, wherever it is dug, when the workmen arrive at the depth of
&s;ixty-three feet, they come to a bed of chalk, which they bore with an augre
five feet deep: they then withdraw from the pit, before the augre is re|moved,
and upon its extraction, the water bur&s;ts up through the aperture with great
violence, and quickly fills this new made well, which continues full, and is
affected neither by rains nor droughts. But that which is mo&s;t remarkable in
this operation, is the layers of earth as we de&s;cend. At the depth of
fourteen feet, are found the ruins of an ancient city, paved &s;treets,
hou&s;es, floors, and different pieces of Mo&s;aic. Under this is found a
&s;olid earth, that would induce one to think had never been removed; however,
under it is found a &s;oft oozy earth, made up of vegetables; and at
twenty-&s;ix feet depth, large trees entire, &s;uch as walnut-trees, with the
walnuts &s;till &s;ticking on the &s;tem, and their leaves and branches in
exact pre&s;ervation. At twenty-eight feet deep, a &s;oft chalk is found, mixed
with a va&s;t quantity of &s;hells; and this bed is eleven feet thick. Under
this, vegeta|bles are found again, with leaves, and branches of trees as
before; and thus alternately chalk and vegetable earth to the depth of
&s;ixty-three <PB N="283" REF="306"> feet. The&s;e are the layers wherever the
work|men attempt to bore; while in many of them, they al&s;o find pieces of
charcoal, bones, and bits of iron. From this de&s;cription, therefore, it
appears, that this country has been alternately overflowed and de&s;erted by
the &s;ea, one age after another: nor were the&s;e overflowings and retir|ings
of trifling depth, or of &s;hort continuance. When the &s;ea bur&s;t in, it
mu&s;t have been a long time in overwhelming the branches of the fallen
fore&s;t with its &s;ediment; and &s;till longer in form|ing a regular bed of
&s;hells eleven feet over them. It mu&s;t have, therefore, taken an age, at
lea&s;t, to make any one of the&s;e layers; and we may conclude, that it mu&s;t
have been many ages employed in the production of them all. The land al&s;o,
upon being de&s;erted, mu&s;t have had time to grow compact, to gather fre&s;h
fertility, and to be drained of its waters before it could be di&s;po&s;ed to
vegetation; or before its trees could have &s;hot forth again to maturity.</P>
<P>We have in&s;tances nearer home of the &s;ame kind, given us in the
Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions; one of them by Mr. Derham. An inundation of the
&s;ea, at Dagenham, in E&s;&s;ex, laying bare a part of the adjacent pa&s;ture,
for above two hundred feet wide, and, in &s;ome places, twenty deep, it
di&s;covered a number of trees that had <PB N="284" REF="307"> lain there for
many ages before; the&s;e trees, by lying long under ground, were become black
and hard, and their fibres &s;o tough, that one might as ea&s;ily break a wire,
as any of them: they lay &s;o thick in the place where they were found, that in
many parts he could &s;tep from one to another: he conceived al&s;o, that not
only all the adjacent mar&s;hes, for &s;everal hundred acres, were covered
underneath with &s;uch tim|ber, but al&s;o the mar&s;hes along the mouth of the
Thames, for &s;everal miles. The meeting with the&s;e trees at &s;uch depths,
he a&s;cribes to the &s;e|diment of the river, and the tides, which
con|&s;tantly wa&s;hing over them, have always left &s;ome part of their
&s;ub&s;tance behind, &s;o as, by repeated alluvions, to work a bed of
vegetable earth over them, to the height at which he found it.</P>
<P>The levels of Hatfield-Chace, in York&s;hire, a tract of above
eighteen thou&s;and acres, which was yearly overflown, was reduced to arable
and pa&s;ture-land, by one Sir Cornelius Ver|mu&s;den, a Dutchman. At the
bottom of this wide extent, are found millions of the roots and bodies of
trees, of &s;uch as this i&s;land either formerly did, or does at pre&s;ent
produce. The roots of all &s;tand in their proper po&s;tures; and by them, as
thick as ever they could <PB N="285" REF="308"> grow, the re&s;pective trunks
of each, &s;ome above thirty yards long. The oaks, &s;ome of which have been
&s;old for fifteen pounds a piece, are as black as ebony, very la&s;ting, and
clo&s;e grained. The a&s;h-trees are as &s;oft as earth, and are commonly cut
in pieces by the workmen's &s;pades, and as &s;oon as flung up into the open
air, turn to du&s;t. But all the re&s;t, even the willows them&s;elves, which
are &s;ofter than the a&s;h, pre&s;erve their &s;ub&s;tance and texture to this
very day. Some of the firs appear to have ve|getated, even after they were
fallen, and to have, from their branches, &s;truck up large trees, as great as
the parent trunk. It is ob&s;ervable, that many of the&s;e trees have been
burnt, &s;ome quite through, &s;ome on one &s;ide, &s;ome have been found
chopped and &s;quared, others riven with great wooden wedges, all
&s;ufficiently ma|nife&s;ting, that the country which was deluged, had formerly
been inhabited. Near a great root of one tree, were found eight coins of the
Roman emperors; and, in &s;ome places, the marks of the ridge and furrow were
plainly perceivable, which te&s;tified that the ground had formerly been
patient of cultivation.</P>
<P>The learned naturali&s;t who has given this de&s;cription<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. iv. part ii. p. 214.</BIBL></NOTE>, has
pretty plainly evinced, that <PB N="286" REF="309"> this fore&s;t, in
particular, mu&s;t have been thus levelled by the Romans; and that the falling
of the trees, mu&s;t have contributed to the ac|cumulation of the waters. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Romans," &s;ays he, "when the Britons fled,
always pur&s;ued them into the fortre&s;&s;es of low woods, and miry fore&s;ts:
in the&s;e, the wild natives found &s;helter; and, when opportunity offered,
i&s;&s;ued out, and fell upon their invaders without mercy. In this manner, the
Romans were at length &s;o har|ra&s;&s;ed, that orders were i&s;&s;ued out for
cutting down all the woods and fore&s;ts in Britain. In order to effect this,
and de&s;troy the enemy the ea&s;ier, they &s;et fire to the woods, compo&s;ed
of pines, and other inflamable timber, which &s;preading, the conflagration
de&s;troyed not only the fore&s;t, but infinite numbers of the wretched
inhabitants who had taken &s;helter therein: When the pine-trees had thus done
what mi&s;|chief they could, the Romans then brought their army nearer, and,
with whole legions of the captive Britons, cut down mo&s;t of the trees that
were yet left &s;tanding; leaving only here and there &s;ome great trees
untouched, as monuments of their fury. The&s;e, unneedful of their labour,
being de&s;titute of the &s;upport of the underwood, and of their neighbouring
trees, were ea&s;ily overthrown by the winds, and, without inter|ruption, 
<PB N="287" REF="310"> remained on the places where they happened to fall. The
fore&s;t, thus fallen, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;topped up the currents,
both from land and &s;ea; and turned into great lakes, what were before but
temporary &s;treams. The working of the waters here, the con&s;umption and
decay of rotten boughs and branches, and the va&s;t encrea&s;e of water-mo&s;s
which flouri&s;hes upon mar&s;hy grounds, &s;oon formed a covering over the
trunks of the fallen trees, and rai&s;ed the earth &s;everal feet above its
former level. The earth thus every day &s;welling, by a conti|nual encrea&s;e
from the &s;ediment of the waters, and by the lightne&s;s of the vegetable
&s;ub&s;tances of which it was compo&s;ed, &s;oon overtopt the waters by which
this intume&s;cence was at fir&s;t effected; &s;o that it entirely got rid of
its inun|dations, or only demanded a &s;light a&s;&s;i&s;tance from man for
that purpo&s;e."</Q> And this may be the origin of all bogs what&s;oever, which
are formed by the putrefaction of vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, mixed with the mud
and &s;lime depo|&s;ited by waters, and at length acquiring a &s;uf|ficient
con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>From this we &s;ee what powerful effects the &s;ea is capable of
producing upon its &s;hores, either by overflowing &s;ome, or de&s;erting
others; by <PB N="288" REF="311"> altering the direction of the&s;e, and
rendering tho&s;e craggy and precipitate, which before were &s;helving. But the
influence it has upon the&s;e, is nothing to that which it has upon that great
body of earth which forms its bottom. It is at the bottom of the &s;ea that the
greate&s;t wonders are performed, and the mo&s;t rapid changes are produced; it
is there that the motion of the tides and the currents have their whole force,
and agitate the &s;ub&s;tances of which their bed is com|po&s;ed. But all
the&s;e are almo&s;t wholly hid from human curio&s;ity: the miracles of the
deep are performed in &s;ecret; and we have but little information from its
aby&s;&s;es, except what we receive by in&s;pection at very &s;hallow depths,
or by the plummet, or from divers, who are known to de&s;cend from twenty to
thirty fathom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. iv. part ii. p.
192.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The eye can reach but a very &s;hort way into the depths of the
&s;ea; and that only when its &s;urface is gla&s;&s;y and &s;erene. In many
&s;eas it perceives nothing but a bright &s;andy plain at bottom, extending for
&s;everal hundred miles, without an intervening object. But in others,
particularly in the Red Sea, it is very different: the whole bottom of this
exten&s;ive bed of waters is, literally &s;peaking, a fore&s;t of &s;ub|marine 
<PB N="289" REF="312"> plants, and corals formed by in&s;ects for their
habitation, &s;ometimes branching out to a great extent. Here are &s;een the
madrepores, the &s;ponges, mo&s;&s;es, &s;ea mu&s;hrooms, and other marine
productions, covering every part of the bottom; &s;o that &s;ome have even
&s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ea to have taken its name from the colour of its plants
below. However, the&s;e plants are by no means peculiar to this &s;ea, as they
are found in great quantities in the Per&s;ian gulph, along the coa&s;ts of
Africa, and tho&s;e of Provence and Catalonia.</P>
<P>The bottom of many parts of the &s;ea near America, pre&s;ents a
very different, though a very beautiful appearance. This is covered with
vegetables, which make it look as green as a meadow, and beneath are &s;een
thou&s;ands of tur|tles, and other &s;ea animals, feeding thereon.</P>
<P>In order to extend our knowledge of the &s;ea to greater depths,
recour&s;e has been had to the plummet; which is generally made of a lump of
lead of about forty pounds weight, fa&s;tened to a cord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>. This, however, only
an&s;wers in mo|derate depths; for when a deep &s;ea is to be &s;ounded, the
matter of which the cord is com|po&s;ed, being lighter than the water, floats
upon <PB N="290" REF="313"> it, and when let down to a con&s;iderable depth,
its length &s;o encrea&s;es its &s;urface, that it is often &s;ufficient to
prevent the lead from &s;inking; &s;o that this may be the rea&s;on that &s;ome
parts of the &s;ea are &s;aid to have no bottom.</P>
<P>In general, we learn from the plummet, that the bottom of the &s;ea
is tolerably even where it has been examined; and that the farther from the
&s;hore, the &s;ea is in general the deeper. Not|with&s;tanding, now and then,
in the mid&s;t of a great and unfathomable ocean, we often find an i&s;land
rai&s;ing its head, and &s;ingly braving its fury. Such i&s;lands may be
con&s;idered as the mountains of the deep; and, could we for a moment imagine
the waters of the ocean re|moved, or dried away, we &s;hould probably find the
inequalities of its bed re&s;embling tho&s;e that are found at land. Here
exten&s;ive plains; there valleys; and, in many places, mountains of amazing
height. M. Buache has actually given us a map of that part of its bottom, which
lies between Africa and America, taken from the &s;everal &s;oundings of
mariners: in it we find the &s;ame uneven &s;urface that we do upon land, the
&s;ame eminences, and the &s;ame de|pre&s;&s;ions. In &s;uch an imaginary
pro&s;pect, how|ever, there would be this difference, that as the tops of land
mountains appear the mo&s;t barren <PB N="291" REF="314"> and rocky, the tops
of &s;ea-mountains would be found the mo&s;t verdant and fruitful.</P>
<P>The plummet, which thus gives us &s;ome idea of the inequalities of
the bottom, leaves us to|tally in the dark as to every other particular;
recour&s;e, therefore, has been had to divers: the&s;e, either being bred up in
this dangerous way of life, and accu&s;tomed to remain &s;ome time under water
without breathing, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by means of a diving-bell, have been able
to return &s;ome confu&s;ed and uncertain accounts of the places below. In the
great diving-bell improved by Doctor Halley, which was large enough to con|tain
five men, and was &s;upplied with fre&s;h air by buckets, that alternately
ro&s;e and fell, they de&s;cended fifty fathom. In this huge machine, which was
let down from the ma&s;t of the &s;hip, the doctor him&s;elf went down to the
bottom, where, when the &s;ea was clear, and e&s;pecially when the &s;un
&s;hone, he could &s;ee perfectly well to write or read, and much more to take
up any thing that was underneath: at other times, when the water was troubled
and thick, it was as dark as night below, &s;o that he was obliged to keep a
candle lighted at the bottom. But there is one thing very remarkable, which is,
that the water which from above was u&s;ually &s;een of a green colour, when
looked at from below, ap|peared <PB N="292" REF="315"> to him of a very
different one, ca&s;ting a redne&s;s upon one of his hands, like that of
da|ma&s;k ro&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Newton's Optic, p.
56.</BIBL></NOTE>.&mdash;A proof of the &s;ea's taking its colour not from any
thing floating in it, but from the different reflexions of the rays of light.
Upon the whole, the accounts we have received from the bottom, by this
contrivance, are but few. We learn from it, and from divers in general, that
while the &s;urface of the &s;ea may be de|formed by tempe&s;ts, it is
u&s;ually calm and tem|perate below<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle,
vol. iii. p. 242.</BIBL></NOTE>; that &s;ome divers who have gone down when the
weather was calm, and came up when it was tempe&s;tuous, were &s;urprized at
their not perceiving the change at the bottom. This, however, mu&s;t not be
&s;uppo&s;ed to obtain with regard to the tides, and the cur|rents, as they are
&s;een con&s;tantly &s;hifting their bottom; taking their bed with great
violence from one place, and depo&s;iting it upon ano|ther. We are informed,
al&s;o, by divers, that the &s;ea grows colder in proportion as they de&s;cend
to the bottom; that as far as the &s;un's rays pierce, it is influenced by
their warmth; but lower, the cold becomes almo&s;t intolerable. A per&s;on of
quality, who had been him&s;elf a diver, as Mr. Boyle informs us, declared,
that though he &s;eldom de&s;cended above three or four <PB N="293" REF="316">
fathoms, yet he found it &s;o much colder than near the top, that he could not
well endure it; and that being let down in a great diving-bell, although the
water could not immediately touch him, he found the air extremely cold upon his
fir&s;t arrival at the bottom.</P>
<P>From divers al&s;o we learn, that the &s;ea in many places is filled
with rocks at bottom; and that among their clifts, and upon their &s;ides,
various &s;ub&s;tances &s;prout forward, which are either really vegetables, or
the ne&s;ts of in&s;ects, encrea&s;ed to &s;ome magnitude. Some of the&s;e
a&s;|&s;ume the &s;hape of beautiful flowers; and, tho' &s;oft, when taken up,
&s;oon harden, and are kept in the cabinets of the curious.</P>
<P>But, of all tho&s;e divers who have brought us information from the
bottom of the deep, the famous Nicola Pe&s;ce, who&s;e performances are told us
by Kircher, is the mo&s;t celebrated. I will not &s;o much as pretend to vouch
for the veracity of Kircher's account, which he a&s;&s;ures us he had from the
archives of the kings of Sicily; but it may &s;erve to enliven an heavy
chapter. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the times of Frederic, king of Sicily, there
lived a celebrated diver, who&s;e name was Nicolas, and who, from his amazing
&s;kill in &s;wimming, and his per&s;e|verance under water, was &s;urnamed the
fi&s;h. <PB N="294" REF="317"> This man had, from his infancy, been u&s;ed to
the &s;ea; and earned his &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by diving for corals, and
oy&s;ters; which he &s;old to the villages on &s;hore. His long acquaint|ance
with the &s;ea, at la&s;t, brought it to be almo&s;t his natural element. He
frequently was known to &s;pend five days in the mid&s;t of the waves, without
any other provi&s;ions than the fi&s;h which he caught there, and ate raw. He
often &s;wam over from Sicily into Calabria, a tempe&s;tuous and dangerous
pa&s;&s;age, car|rying letters from the king. He was fre|quently known to
&s;wim among the gulphs of the Lipari i&s;lands, no way apprehen&s;ive of
danger. 
<P>"Some mariners out at &s;ea one day ob&s;erved &s;omething at
&s;ome di&s;tance from them, which they regarded as a &s;ea-mon&s;ter; but upon
its approach, it was known to be Nicolas, whom they took into their &s;hip.
When they a&s;ked him whither he was going in &s;o &s;tormy and rough a &s;ea,
and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from land, he &s;hewed them a packet of letters,
which he was carrying to one of the towns of Italy, ex|actly done up in a
leather bag, in &s;uch a man|ner as that they could not be wetted by the &s;ea.
He kept them thus company for &s;ome time on their voyage, conver&s;ing, and
a&s;king que&s;tions; <PB N="295" REF="318"> and after eating an hearty meal
with them, he took his leave, and jumping into the &s;ea, pur|&s;ued his voyage
alone.</P> 
<P>"In order to aid the&s;e powers of enduring in the deep, nature
&s;eemed to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in a very extraordinary manner; for the
&s;paces between his fingers and toes were webbed, as in a goo&s;e; and his
che&s;t became &s;o very capa|cious, that he could take in at one
in&s;piration, as much breath as would &s;erve him for an whole day.</P> 
<P>"The account of &s;o extraordinary a per&s;on did not fail to
reach the king him&s;elf; who, actuated by the general curio&s;ity, ordered
that Nicolas &s;hould be brought before him. It was no ea&s;y matter to find
Nicolas, who generally &s;pent his time in the &s;olitudes of the deep; but at
la&s;t, however, after much &s;earching, he was found, and brought before his
maje&s;ty. The curio&s;ity of this monarch had been long excited by the
accounts he had heard of the bottom of the gulph of Charybdis; he now,
therefore, con|ceived that it would be a proper opportunity to have more
certain information. He therefore commanded our poor diver to examine the
bot|tom of this dreadful whirlpool; and, as an in|citement to his obedience,
ordered a golden <PB N="296" REF="319"> cup to be flung into it. Nicolas was
not in&s;en&s;ible of the danger to which he was ex|po&s;ed; dangers be&s;t
known only to him&s;elf; and he therefore pre&s;umed to remon&s;trate: but the
hopes of the reward, the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing the king, and the plea&s;ure of
&s;hewing his &s;kill, at la&s;t prevailed. He in&s;tantly jumped into the
gulph, and was &s;wallowed as in&s;tantly up in its bo&s;om. He continued for
three quarters of an hour below; during which time, the king and his attendants
remained upon &s;hore, anxious for his fate; but he at la&s;t ap|peared,
buffeting upon the &s;urface, holding the cup in triumph in one hand, and
making his way good among the waves with the other. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed he
was received with applau&s;e, upon his arrival on &s;hore: the cup was made the
reward of his adventure; the king ordered him to be taken proper care of; and,
as he was &s;omewhat fatigued and debilitated by his la|bour, after an hearty
meal, he was put to bed, and permitted to refre&s;h him&s;elf by
&s;leeping.</P> 
<P>"When his &s;pirits were thus re&s;tored, he was again brought,
to &s;atisfy the king's curio&s;ity with a narrative of the wonders he had
&s;een; and his account was to the following effect. He would never, he &s;aid,
have obeyed the king's commands, had he been apprized of half the 
<PB N="297" REF="320"> dangers that were before him. There were four things, he
&s;aid, that rendered the gulph dread|ful, not only to men, but even to the
fi&s;hes them&s;elves: fir&s;t, the force of the water bur&s;ting up from the
bottom, which require great &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t; &s;econdly, the
abruptne&s;s of the rocks, that on every &s;ide threatened de&s;truction;
thirdly, the force of the whirlpool, da&s;hing again&s;t tho&s;e rocks; and
fourthly, the number and magnitude of the polypous fi&s;h, &s;ome of which
appeared as large as a man, and which every where &s;ticking again&s;t the
rocks, pro|jected their fibrous arms to entangle him. Being a&s;ked how he was
able &s;o readily to find the cup that had been thrown in, he replied, that it
happened to be flung by the waves into the cavity of a rock, again&s;t which he
him&s;elf was urged in his de&s;cent. This account, however, did not &s;atisfy
the king's curio&s;ity: being reque&s;t|ed to venture once more into the gulph
for fur|ther di&s;coveries, he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed; but the king, de&s;irous
of having the mo&s;t exact information po&s;&s;ible of all things to be found
in the gulph, repeated his &s;ollicitations; and, to give them &s;till greater
weight, produced a larger cup than the former, and added al&s;o a pur&s;e of
gold. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, the unfortunate Pe&s;|&s;acola once again
plunged into the whirlpool, and was never heard of more."</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. A &s;ummary Account of the Mechanical Pro|perties of
Air.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed the earth and the &s;ea, we now a&s;cend into
that fluid which &s;urrounds them both; and which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
&s;up|ports and &s;upplies all animated nature. As upon viewing the bottom of
the ocean from its &s;ur|face, we &s;ee an infinity of animals moving therein,
and &s;eeking food; &s;o were &s;ome &s;uperior being to regard the earth at a
proper di&s;tance, he might con&s;ider us in the &s;ame light: he might, from
his &s;uperior &s;tation, behold a num|ber of bu&s;y little beings, immer&s;ed
in the aerial fluid, that every where &s;urrounds them, and &s;edulou&s;ly
employed in procuring the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This fluid, though too
fine for the gro&s;s perception of its inhabitants, might, to his nicer organs
of &s;ight, be very vi&s;ible; and, while he at once &s;aw into its operations,
he might &s;mile at the varieties of human conjecture con|cerning it: he might
readily di&s;cern, perhaps, the height above the &s;urface of the earth to
which this fluid atmo&s;phere reaches: he might exactly determine that peculiar
form of its parts which gives it the &s;pring or ela&s;ticity with which it is
endued: he might di&s;tingui&s;h which of its <PB N="299" REF="322"> parts were
pure incorruptible air, and which only made for a little time to a&s;&s;ume the
ap|pearance, &s;o as to be quickly returned back to the element from whence it
came. But as for us, who are immer&s;ed at the bottom of this gulph, we mu&s;t
be contented with a more con|fined knowledge; and, wanting a proper point of
pro&s;pect, remain &s;atisfied with a combination of the effects.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things, therefore, that our &s;en&s;es informs us
of, is, that although the air is too fine for our &s;ight, it is very obvious
to our touch. Although we cannot &s;ee the wind con|tained in a bladder, we can
very readily feel its re&s;i&s;tance; and though the hurricane may want colour,
we often fatally experience that it does not want force. We have equal
experience of the air's &s;pring or ela&s;ticity: the bladder, when
pre&s;&s;ed, returns again, upon the pre&s;&s;ure being taken away; a bottle,
when filled, often bur&s;ts, from the &s;pring of air which is included.</P>
<P>So far the &s;lighte&s;t experience reaches; but, by carrying
experiment a little farther, we learn, that air al&s;o is heavy: a round
gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el being emptied of its air, and accurately weighed, has been
found lighter than when it was weighed with the air in it. Upon computing the
&s;uperior weight of the full ve&s;&s;el, a cubic foot <PB N="300" REF="323">
of air is found to weigh &s;omething more than an ounce.</P>
<P>From this experiment, therefore, we learn, that the earth, and all
things upon its &s;urface, are every where covered with a ponderous fluid,
which ri&s;ing very high over our heads, mu&s;t be proportionably heavy. For
in&s;tance, as in the &s;ea, a man at the depth of twenty feet, &s;u&s;tains a
greater weight of water than a man at the depth of but ten feet; &s;o will a
man at the bottom of a valley have a greater weight of air over him, than a man
on the top of a mountain.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude, that we &s;u&s;tain a very great weight
of air; and although, like men walking at the bottom of the &s;ea, we can|not
feel the weight which pre&s;&s;es equally round us, yet the pre&s;&s;ure is not
the le&s;s real. As in morals, we &s;eldom know the ble&s;&s;ings that
&s;ur|round us till we are deprived of them, &s;o here we do not perceive the
weight of the ambient fluid till a part of it is taken away. If, by any means,
we contrive to take away the pre&s;&s;ure of the air from any one part of our
bodies, we are &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible of the weight upon the other parts.
Thus, if we clap our hand upon the mouth of a ve&s;&s;el from whence the air
has been taken away, there will thus be air on one &s;ide, and none on the
other; upon which, we &s;hall in|&s;tantly <PB N="301" REF="324"> find the hand
violently &s;ucked inwards, which is nothing more than the weight of the air
upon the back of the hand that cru&s;hes it into the &s;pace which is empty
below.</P>
<P>As by this experiment, therefore, we perceive that the air
pre&s;&s;es with great weight upon every thing on the &s;urface of the earth,
&s;o by other experiments we learn the exact weight with which it pre&s;&s;es.
Fir&s;t, if the air be exhau&s;ted out of any ve&s;&s;el, a drinking-gla&s;s
for in&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may be done by burning a bit of
paper in the &s;ame, and then quickly turning it down upon the water.</NOTE>,
and this ve&s;&s;el be &s;et with the mouth down|wards in water, the water will
ri&s;e up into the empty &s;pace, and fill the inverted gla&s;s; for the
external air will, in this ca&s;e, pre&s;s up the water, where there is no
weight to re&s;i&s;t; as, one part of a bed being pre&s;&s;ed, makes the other
parts, that have no weight upon them, ri&s;e. In this ca&s;e, therefore, as was
&s;aid, the water being pre&s;&s;ed without, will ri&s;e in the gla&s;s; and
would continue to ri&s;e (if the empty gla&s;s were tall enough) thirty-two
feet high. In fact, there have been pipes made purpo&s;ely for this
expe|riment, of above thirty-two feet high; in which, upon being exhau&s;ted,
the water has always ri&s;en to the height of thirty-two feet: there it 
<PB N="302" REF="325"> has always re&s;ted, and never a&s;cended higher. From
this, therefore, we learn, that the weight of the air which pre&s;&s;es up the
water, is equal to a pillar or column of water, which is thirty-two feet high;
as it is ju&s;t able to rai&s;e &s;uch a co|lumn, and no more. In other words,
the &s;ur|face of the earth is every where covered with a weight of air, which
is equivalent to a covering of thirty-two feet deep of water; or to a weight of
twenty-nine inches and an half of quick&s;ilver, which is known to be ju&s;t as
heavy as the former.</P>
<P>Thus, therefore, we &s;ee that the air at the &s;urface of the earth
is ju&s;t as heavy as thirty-two feet of water, or twenty-nine inches and an
half of quick&s;ilver; and it is ea&s;ily found, by computation, that to
rai&s;e water thirty-two feet, will require a weight of fifteen pounds upon
every &s;quare inch. Now, if we are fond of computations, we have only to
calculate how many &s;quare inches are in the &s;urface of an or|dinary human
body, and allowing every inch to &s;u&s;tain fifteen pounds, we may amaze
our&s;elves at the weight of air we &s;u&s;tain. It has been computed, and
found, that our ordinary load of air amounts to within a little of forty
thou&s;and pounds: this is wonderful! but wondering is not the way to grow
wi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="326">Notwith&s;tanding this be our ordinary load,
and our u&s;ual &s;upply, there are at different times very great variations.
The air is not, like water, equally heavy at all &s;ea&s;ons; but &s;ometimes
is lighter, and &s;ometimes more heavy. It is &s;ome|times more compre&s;t, and
&s;ometimes more ela&s;tic or &s;pringy, which produces the &s;ame effects as
an encrea&s;e of its weight. The air which at one time rai&s;es water
thirty-two feet in the tube, and quick&s;ilver twenty-nine inches, will not at
another rai&s;e the one to thirty feet, or the other to twenty-&s;ix inches.
This makes, therefore, a very great difference in the weight we &s;u&s;tain;
and we are actually known, by computation, to carry at one time four thou&s;and
pounds of air more than at another.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this &s;urprizing difference in the weight of air,
is either owing to its pre&s;&s;ure from above, or to an encrea&s;e of vapour
floating in it. Its encrea&s;ed pre&s;&s;ure is the con&s;equence of its
&s;pring or ela&s;ticity, which cold and heat &s;en&s;ibly affect, and are
continually changing.</P>
<P>This ela&s;ticity of the air is one of its mo&s;t amazing
properties; and to which it &s;hould &s;eem nothing can &s;et bounds. A body of
air that may be contained in a nut-&s;hell, may ea&s;ily, with heat, be dilated
into a &s;phere of unknown dimen&s;ions. On the contrary, the air contained 
<PB N="304" REF="327"> in an hou&s;e, may be compre&s;&s;ed into a cavity not
larger than the eye of a needle. In &s;hort, no bounds can be &s;et to its
confinement or ex|pan&s;ion; at lea&s;t, experiment has hitherto found its
attempts indefinite. In every &s;ituation, it retains its ela&s;ticity; and the
more clo&s;ely we compre&s;s it, the more &s;trongly does it re&s;i&s;t the
pre&s;&s;ure. If to the encrea&s;ing the ela&s;ticity on one &s;ide by
compre&s;&s;ion, we encrea&s;e it on the other &s;ide by heat, the force of
both &s;oon be|comes irre&s;i&s;tible; and a certain French phi|lo&s;opher
&s;uppo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mon&s;ieur Amontons.</BIBL></NOTE>,
that air thus confined, and expanding, was &s;ufficient for the explo&s;ion of
a world.</P>
<P>Many in&s;truments have been formed to mea|&s;ure and determine
the&s;e different properties of the air; and which &s;erve &s;everal u&s;eful
purpo&s;es. The barometer &s;erves to mea&s;ure its weight; to tell us when it
is heavier, and when lighter. It is compo&s;ed of a gla&s;s tube or pipe, of
about thirty inches in length, clo&s;ed up at one end; this tube is then filled
with quick&s;ilver; this done, the maker clapping his finger upon the open end,
inverts the tube, and plunges the open end, finger and all, into a ba&s;on of
quick|&s;ilver, and then takes his finger away: now the quick&s;ilver in the
tube will, by its own weight, <PB N="305" REF="328"> endeavour to de&s;cend
into that in the ba&s;on; but the external air, pre&s;&s;ing on the &s;urface
of the quick&s;ilver in the ba&s;on without, and no air being in the tube at
top, the quick&s;ilver will continue in the tube, being pre&s;&s;ed up, as was
&s;aid, by the air, on the &s;urface of the ba&s;on be|low. The height at which
it is known to &s;tand in the tube, is u&s;ually about twenty-nine inches, when
the air is heavy; but not above twenty-&s;ix, when the air is very light. Thus,
by this in&s;trument we can, with &s;ome exactne&s;s, de|termine the weight of
the air; and, of con|&s;equence, tell before-hand the changes of the weather.
Before fine dry weather, the air is charged with a variety of vapours, which
float in it un&s;een, and render it extremely heavy, &s;o that it pre&s;&s;es
up the quick&s;ilver; or, in other words, the barometer ri&s;es. In moi&s;t,
rainy weather, the vapours are wa&s;hed down, or there is not heat &s;ufficient
for them to ri&s;e, &s;o that the air is then &s;en&s;ibly lighter, and
pre&s;&s;es up the quick&s;ilver with le&s;s force; or, in other words, the
barometer is &s;een to fall. Our con&s;titutions &s;eem al&s;o to corre&s;pond
with the changes of the weather-gla&s;s; they are braced, &s;trong, and
vigorous, with a large body of air upon them; they are languid, relaxed, and
feeble, when the <PB N="306" REF="329"> air is light, and refu&s;es to give our
fibres their proper tone.</P>
<P>But although the barometer thus mea&s;ures the weight of the air
with exactne&s;s enough for the general purpo&s;es of life, yet it is often
af|fected with a thou&s;and irregularities, that no ex|actne&s;s in the
in&s;trument can remedy, nor no theory account for. When high winds blow, the
quick&s;ilver generally is low: it ri&s;es higher in cold weather, than in
warm; and is u&s;ually higher at morning and evening, than at mid|day: it
generally de&s;cends lower after rain than it was before it. There are al&s;o
frequent changes in the air, without any &s;en&s;ible alteration in the
barometer.</P>
<P>As the barometer is thus u&s;ed in predicting the changes of the
weather, &s;o it is al&s;o &s;erviceable in mea&s;uring the heights of
mountains, which mathematicians cannot &s;o readily do: for, as the higher we
a&s;ccend from the &s;urface of the earth, the air becomes lighter, &s;o the
quick&s;ilver in the barometer will de&s;cend in proportion. It is found to
&s;ink at the rate of the tenth part of an inch for every ninety feet we
a&s;cend; &s;o that in going up a mountain, if I find the quick&s;ilver fallen
an inch, I conclude, that I am got upon an a&s;cent of near nine hundred feet
high. In this there has been found &s;ome variation; into a de|tail 
<PB N="307" REF="330"> of which, it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a natural
hi&s;torian to enter.</P>
<P>In order to determine the ela&s;ticity of air, the wind gun has been
invented, which is an in|&s;trument variou&s;ly made; but in all upon the
principle of compre&s;&s;ing a large quantity of air into a tube, in which
there is an ivory ball, and then giving the compre&s;&s;ed ela&s;tic air free
power to act, and drive the ball as directed. The ball thus driven, will pierce
a thick board: and will be as fatal, at &s;mall di&s;tances, as if driven with
gunpowder. I do not know whether ever the force of this in&s;trument has been
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by means of heat; certain I am, that this, which could be very
ea&s;ily contrived by means of pho&s;phorus, or any other hot &s;ub&s;tance
applied to the barrel, would give &s;uch a force as I doubt whether gunpowder
it&s;elf could produce.</P>
<P>The air-pump is an in&s;trument contrived to exhau&s;t the air from
round a ve&s;&s;el adapted to that purpo&s;e, called a receiver. This method of
exhau&s;ting, is contrived in the &s;imple in&s;tru|ment, by a pi&s;ton, like
that of a &s;yringe, going down into the ve&s;&s;el, and thus pu&s;hing out its
air; which, by means of a valve, is prevented from returning into the
ve&s;&s;el again. But this, like all other complicated in&s;truments, will be
better under&s;tood by a minute in&s;pection, than <PB N="308" REF="331"> an
hour's de&s;cription: it may &s;uffice here to ob|&s;erve, that by depriving
animals, and other &s;ub|&s;tances, of all air, it &s;hews us what the benefits
and effects of air are in &s;u&s;taining life, or pro|moting vegetation.</P>
<P>The dige&s;ter is an in&s;trument of &s;till more ex|traordinary
effects than any of the former; and &s;ufficiently di&s;covers the amazing
force of air, when its ela&s;ticity is augmented by fire. A com|mon tea-kettle,
if the &s;pout were clo&s;ed up, and the lid put firmly down, would &s;erve to
become a dige&s;ter, if &s;trong enough. But the in&s;tru|ment u&s;ed for this
purpo&s;e, is a &s;trong metal pot, with a lid to &s;crew clo&s;e on, &s;o
that, when down, no air can get in or return: into this pot, meat and bones are
put, with a &s;mall quantity of water, and then the lid &s;crewed clo&s;e: a
lighted lamp is put underneath, and, what is very extraordinary, (yet equally
true) in &s;ix or eight minutes the whole ma&s;s, bones and all, are
di&s;&s;olved into a jelly; &s;o great is the force and ela&s;ticity of the air
contained within; &s;truggling to e&s;cape, and breaking in pieces all the
&s;ub|&s;tances with which it is mixed. Care, however, mu&s;t be taken not to
heat this in&s;trument too violently; for then, the inclo&s;ed air would
be|come irre&s;i&s;tible, and bur&s;t the whole, with per|haps a fatal
explo&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="332">There are numberle&s;s other u&s;eful
in&s;tru|ments made to depend on the weight, the ela&s;ticity, or the fluidity
of the air, which do not come within the plan of the pre&s;ent work; the
de&s;ign of which is not to give an account of the inventions that have been
made for deter|mining the nature and properties of air, but a mere narrative of
its effects. The de&s;cription of the pump, the forcing pump, the fire engine,
the &s;team engine, the &s;yphon, and an hundred others, belong not to the
naturali&s;t, but the ex|perimental philo&s;opher: the one gives an hi&s;tory
of Nature, as he finds &s;he pre&s;ents her&s;elf to him; and he draws the
obvious picture: the other, pur&s;ues her with clo&s;e inve&s;tigation,
tortures her by experiment to give up her &s;ecrets, and mea|&s;ures her latent
qualities with laborious pre|ci&s;ion. Much more, therefore, might be &s;aid of
the mechanical effects of air, and of the con|jectures that have been made
re&s;pecting the form of its parts; how &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed them to
re&s;emble little hoops, coil'd up in a &s;pring; others, like fleeces of wool;
others, that the parts are endued with a repul&s;ive quality, by which, when
&s;queezed together, they endeavour to fly off, and recede from each other. We
might have given the di&s;putes relative to the <PB N="310" REF="333"> height
to which this body of air extends above us, and concerning which there is no
agree|ment. We might have enquired how much of the air we breathe is
elementary, and not redu|cible to any other &s;ub&s;tance; and of what
den|&s;ity it would become, if it were &s;uppo&s;ed to be continued down to the
center of the earth. At that place we might, with the help of figures, and a
bold imagination, have &s;hewn it twenty thou&s;and times heavier than its bulk
of gold. We might al&s;o prove it millions of times purer than upon earth, when
rai&s;ed to the &s;ur|face of the atmo&s;phere. But the&s;e &s;peculations do
not belong to natural hi&s;tory; and they have hitherto produced no great
advantages in that branch of &s;cience to which they more properly
appertain.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. An E&s;&s;ay towards a Natural Hi&s;tory of the
Air.</HEAD>
<P>A Late eminent philo&s;opher has con&s;idered our atmo&s;phere as
one large chymical ve&s;&s;el, in which an infinite number of various
operations are con&s;tantly performing. In it all the bodies of the earth are
continually &s;ending up a part of their &s;ub&s;tance by evaporation, to mix
in this great alembic, and to float a-while in common. Here minerals, from
their lowe&s;t depths, a&s;cend in noxious, or in warm vapours, to make a part
of the general ma&s;s; &s;eas, rivers, and &s;ubter|raneous &s;prings,
furni&s;h their copious &s;upplies; plants receive and return their &s;hare;
and ani|mals, that by living upon, con&s;ume this general &s;tore, are found to
give it back in greater quan|tities, when they die<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle, vol. ii. p. 593.</BIBL></NOTE>. The air, therefore,
that we breathe, and upon which we &s;ub&s;i&s;t, bears very little
re&s;emblance to that pure elementary body which was de&s;cribed in the la&s;t
chapter; and which is rather a &s;ub&s;tance that may be conceived, than
experienced to exi&s;t. Air, &s;uch as we find it, is one of the mo&s;t
compounded bodies in all nature. Water may be reduced to <PB N="312" REF="335">
a fluid every way re&s;embling air, by heat; which, by cold, becomes water
again. Every thing we &s;ee, gives off its parts to the air, and has a little
floating atmo&s;phere of its own round it. The ro&s;e is encompa&s;&s;ed with a
&s;phere of its own odorous particles; while the night-&s;hade in|fects the air
with &s;cents of a more ungrateful nature. The perfume of mu&s;k flies off in
&s;uch abundance, that the quantity remaining, be|comes &s;en&s;ibly lighter by
the lo&s;s. A thou&s;and &s;ub&s;tances that e&s;cape all our &s;en&s;es, we
know to be there; the powerful emanations of the load-&s;tone, the effluvia of
electricity, the rays of light, and the in&s;inuations of fire. Such are the
various &s;ub&s;tances through which we move, and which we are con&s;tantly
taking in at every pore, and returning again with imperceptible
di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>This great &s;olution, or mixture of all earthly bodies, is
continually operating upon it&s;elf; which, perhaps, may be the cau&s;e of its
un|cea&s;ing motion: but it operates &s;till more vi&s;ibly upon &s;uch
gro&s;&s;er &s;ub&s;tances as are expo&s;ed to its influence; for &s;carce any
&s;ub&s;tance is found capable of re&s;i&s;ting the corroding qualities of the
air. The air, &s;ay the chymi&s;ts, is a chaos, fur|ni&s;hed with all kinds of
&s;alts and men&s;truums; and, therefore, it is capable of di&s;&s;olving all 
<PB N="313" REF="336"> kinds of bodies. It is well known, that copper and iron
are quickly covered, and eaten with ru&s;t; and that in the climates near the
equator, no art can keep them clean. In tho&s;e dreary countries, the
in&s;truments, knives and keys, that are kept in the pocket, neverthele&s;s are
quickly encru&s;ted; and the great guns, with every pre|caution, after &s;ome
years, become u&s;ele&s;s. Stones, as being le&s;s hard, may be readily
&s;up|po&s;ed to be more ea&s;ily &s;oluble. The marble of which the noble
monuments of Italian antiquity are compo&s;ed, although in one of the fine&s;t
cli|mates in the world, neverthele&s;s &s;hew the im|pre&s;&s;ions which have
been made upon them by the air. In many places they &s;eem worm-eaten by time;
and, in others, they appear crumbling into du&s;t. Gold alone &s;eems to be
exempted from this general &s;tate of di&s;&s;olution; it is never found to
contract ru&s;t, though expo&s;ed never &s;o long: the rea&s;on of this &s;eems
to be, that &s;ea-&s;alt, which is the only men&s;truum capable of act|ing
upon, and di&s;&s;olving gold, is but very little mixed with the air; for
&s;alt being a very fixed body, and not apt to volatilize, and ri&s;e with
heat, there is but a &s;mall proportion of it in the atmo&s;phere. In the
elaboratories, and &s;hops, however, where &s;alt is much u&s;ed, and the air 
<PB N="314" REF="337"> is impregnated with it, gold is found to ru&s;t as well
as other metals.</P>
<P>Bodies of a &s;ofter nature are obviou&s;ly de|&s;troyed by the
air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iii. p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr.
Boyle &s;ays, that &s;ilks brought to Jamaica, will, if there expo&s;ed to the
air, rot even while they pre&s;erve their colour; but if kept therefrom, they
both retain their &s;trength and glo&s;s. The &s;ame happens in Bra&s;il, where
their cloaths, which are black, &s;oon turn of an iron colour; though, in the
&s;hops, they pre&s;erve their proper hue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid, vol. iii. p. 68.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the&s;e tropical
climates al&s;o, &s;uch are the putre&s;cent qualities of the air, that white
&s;ugar will &s;ometimes be full of maggots. Drugs and plai&s;ters lo&s;e their
virtue, and become verminous. In &s;ome places they are obliged to expo&s;e
their &s;weetmeats by day in the &s;un, otherwi&s;e the night air would quickly
cau&s;e them to putrefy. On the con|trary, in the cold arctic regions, animal
&s;ub|&s;tances, during their winter, are never known to putrefy; and meat may
be kept for months, without any &s;alt what&s;oever. This experiment happily
&s;ucceeded with the eight Engli&s;hmen that were accidentally left upon the
inho&s;pitable coa&s;ts of Greenland, at a place where &s;even Dutchmen had
peri&s;hed but a few years before; for killing &s;ome rein-deer for their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, <PB N="315" REF="338"> and having no &s;alt to pre&s;erve
the fle&s;h, to their great &s;urprize, they &s;oon found it did not want any,
as it remained &s;weet during their eight months continuance upon that
&s;hore.</P>
<P>The&s;e powers with which air is endued over unorganized
&s;ub&s;tances, are exerted in a &s;till &s;tronger manner over plants, animals
of an in|ferior nature, and, la&s;tly, over man him&s;elf. Mo&s;t of the
beauty, and the luxuriance of vege|tation, is well known to be derived from the
be|nign influence of the air: and every plant &s;eems to have its favourite
climate, not le&s;s than its proper &s;oil. The lower ranks of animals al&s;o,
&s;eem formed for their re&s;pective climates, in which only they can live. Man
alone &s;eems the child of every climate, and capable of exi&s;ting in all.
However, this peculiar privilege does not exempt him from the influences of the
air; he is as much &s;ubject to its malignity, as the meane&s;t in&s;ect or
vegetable.</P>
<P>With regard to plants, air is &s;o ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for
their life and pre&s;ervation, that they will not vegetate in an exhau&s;ted
receiver. All plants have within them a quantity of air, which &s;upports and
agitates their juices. They are con|tinually imbibing fre&s;h nutriment from
the air, to encrea&s;e this &s;tore, and to &s;upply the wants which they
&s;u&s;tain from evaporation. When, <PB N="316" REF="339"> therefore, the
external air is drawn from them, they are no longer able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Even
that quantity of air which they before were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, e&s;capes
through their pores, into the ex|hau&s;ted receiver; and as this continues to
be pumped away, they become languid, grow flac|cid, and die. However, the plant
or flower thus cea&s;ing to vegetate, is kept, by being &s;e|cured from the
external air, a much longer time &s;weet than it would have continued, had it
been openly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>That air which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the life of vegetables, is
&s;till more &s;o to that of animals; there are none found, how &s;eemingly
torpid &s;o|ever, that do not require their needful &s;upply. Fi&s;hes
them&s;elves will not live in water from whence the air is exhau&s;ted; and it
is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that they die in frozen ponds, from the want of this
nece&s;&s;ary to animal exi&s;tence. Many have been the animals that idle
curio&s;ity has tor|tured in the pri&s;on of a receiver, merely to ob|&s;erve
the manner of their dying. We &s;hall, from a thou&s;and in&s;tances, produce
that of the viper, as it is known to be one of the mo&s;t vi|vacious reptiles
in the world; and as we &s;hall feel but little compa&s;&s;ion for its
tortures. Mr. Boyle took a new caught viper, and &s;hutting it up into a
&s;mall receiver, began to pump away <PB N="317" REF="340"> the air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle's Phico. Mechan. Exper. Pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"At fir&s;t, upon the air's being drawn away, it
began to &s;well; &s;ome time after he had done pumping, it began to gape, and
open its jaws; being thus compelled to open its jaws, it once more re&s;umed
its former lankne&s;s; it then began to move up and down within, as if to
&s;eek for air, and after a while foamed a little, leaving the foam &s;ticking
to the in&s;ide of the gla&s;s; &s;oon after the body and neck grew
pro|digiou&s;ly tumid, and a bli&s;ter appeared upon its back; an hour and an
half after the receiver was exhau&s;ted, the di&s;tended viper moved, and gave
manife&s;t &s;igns of life; the jaws remained quite di&s;tended; as it were
from beneath the epi|glottis, came the black tongue, and reached be|yond it;
but the animal &s;eemed, by its po&s;ture, not to have any life: the mouth
al&s;o was grown blacki&s;h within; and in this &s;ituation it continued for
twenty-three hours. But upon the air's being re-admitted, the viper's mouth was
pre&s;ently clo&s;ed, and &s;oon after opened again; and for &s;ome time
tho&s;e motions continued, which ar|gued the remains of life."</Q> Such is the
fate of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant or minute reptile that can be thus included.
Mites, fleas, and even the little eels that are found &s;wimming in vinegar,
die for want of air. Not only the&s;e, but the eggs <PB N="318" REF="341"> of
the&s;e animals, will not produce in vacuo, but require air to bring them to
perfection.</P>
<P>As in this manner air is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence,
&s;o al&s;o it mu&s;t be of a proper kind, and not impregnated with foreign
mixtures. That factitious air which is pumped from plants or fluids, is
generally, in a &s;hort time, fatal to them. Mr. Boyle has given us many
expe|riments to this purpo&s;e. After having &s;hewn that all vegetable, and
mo&s;t mineral &s;ub&s;tances, properly prepared, may afford air, by being
placed in an exhau&s;ted receiver, and this in &s;uch quantities, that &s;ome
have thought it a new &s;ub|&s;tance, made by the alteration which the mi|neral
or plant has undergone by the texture of its parts being loo&s;ened in the
operation&mdash;hav|ing &s;hewn, I &s;ay, that this air may be drawn in great
quantities from vegetable, animal, or mi|neral &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as
apples, cherries, amber burnt, or hart&s;horn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Boyle's Phy&s;ic. Mechan. vol. ii. p.
598.</BIBL></NOTE>&mdash;he included a frog in artificial air, produced from
pa&s;te; in &s;even mi|nutes &s;pace it &s;uffered convul&s;ions, and at la&s;t
lay &s;till, and being taken out, recovered no motion at all, but was dead. A
bird enclo&s;ed in artificial air, from rai&s;ins, died in a quarter of a
minute, and never &s;tirred more. A &s;nail was put into the receiver, with air
of pa&s;te; in four <PB N="319" REF="342"> minutes it cea&s;ed to move, and was
dead, altho' it had &s;urvived in vacuo for &s;everal hours: &s;o that
factitious air proved a greater enemy to animals than even a vacuum
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Air al&s;o may be impregnated with fumes that are in&s;tantly fatal
to animals. The fumes of hot iron, copper, or any other heated metal, blown
into the place where an animal is confined, in|&s;tantly de&s;troy it. We have
already mentioned the vapours in the grotto Del Cane &s;uffocating a dog. The
ancients even &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e animals, as they always ran with their
no&s;es to the ground, were the fir&s;t that felt any infection. In &s;hort, it
&s;hould &s;eem that the predominance of any one vapour, from any body, how
whol|&s;ome &s;oever in it&s;elf, becomes infectious; and that we owe the
&s;alubrity of the air to the va|riety of its mixture.</P>
<P>But there is no animal who&s;e frame is more &s;en&s;ibly affected
by the changes of the air than man. It is true, he can endure a greater
va|riety of climates than the lower orders generally are able to do; but it is
rather by the means which he has di&s;covered of obviating their effects, than
by the apparent &s;trength of his con&s;titution. Mo&s;t other animals can bear
cold or hunger better, endure greater fatigues in pro|portion, and are
&s;atisfied with &s;horter repo&s;e. <PB N="320" REF="343"> The variations of
the climate, therefore, would probably affect them le&s;s, if they had the
&s;ame means or &s;kill in providing again&s;t the &s;everities of the change.
However this be, the body of man is an in&s;trument much more nicely
&s;en&s;ible of the variations of the air, than any of tho&s;e which his own
art has produced; for his frame alone &s;eems to unite all their properties,
being invi|gorated by the weight of the air, relaxed by its moi&s;ture,
enfeebled by its heat, and &s;tiffened by its frigidity.</P>
<P>But it is chiefly by the predominance of &s;ome peculiar vapour,
that the air becomes unfit for human &s;upport. It is often found, by dreadful
experience, to enter into the con&s;titution, to mix with its juices, and to
putrefy the whole ma&s;s of blood. The nervous &s;y&s;tem is not le&s;s
affected by its operations; pal&s;ies and vertigoes are cau&s;ed by its damps;
and a &s;till more fatal train of di&s;tempers by its exhalations. In order
that the air &s;hould be whole&s;ome, it is nece&s;&s;ary, as we have &s;een,
that it &s;hould not be of one kind, but the compound of &s;everal
&s;ub&s;tances; and the more various the compo&s;ition, to all appear|ance the
more &s;alubrious. A man, therefore, who continues in one place, is not &s;o
likely to enjoy this whole&s;ome variety, as he who changes his &s;ituation;
and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, in&s;tead <PB N="321" REF="344"> of waiting
for a renovation of air, walks forward to meet its arrival. Thus mere motion,
inde|pendent even of the benefits of exerci&s;e, becomes whol&s;ome, by thus
&s;upplying a greater variety of that healthful fluid by which we are
&s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and accidents are found to encrea&s;e the&s;e bodies of
vapour, that make one place more or le&s;s whol&s;ome than another. Heat may
rai&s;e them in too great quantities; and cold may &s;tagnate them. Minerals
may give off their effluvia in &s;uch proportion as to keep away all other kind
of air; vegetables may render the air unwhol&s;ome by their &s;upply; and
animal putrefaction &s;eems to furni&s;h a quantity of vapour, at lea&s;t as
noxious as any of the former. All the&s;e united, generally make up the ma&s;s
of re&s;piration, and are, when mixed together, harmle&s;s; but any one of
them, for a long time &s;ingly predominant, becomes at length fatal.</P>
<P>The effects of heat in producing a noxious quality in the air, are
well known. Tho&s;e torrid regions under the Line are always unwhol&s;ome. At
Senegal, I am told, the natives con&s;ider forty as a very advanced time of
life, and generally die of old age at fifty. At Carthagena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>, in America, where the
heat of the hotte&s;t day ever <PB N="322" REF="345"> known in Europe is
continual, where, during their winter &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e dreadful heats are
united with a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thunder, rain, and tempe&s;ts,
ari&s;ing from their inten&s;e|ne&s;s, the wan and livid complexions of the
in|habitants might make &s;trangers &s;u&s;pect that they were ju&s;t recovered
from &s;ome dreadful di&s;tem|per; the actions of the natives are conformable
to their colour; in all their motions there is &s;ome|what relaxed and languid;
the heat of the cli|mate even affects their &s;peech, which is &s;oft and
&s;low, and their words generally broken. Tra|vellers from Europe retain their
&s;trength and ruddy colour in that climate, po&s;&s;ibly for three or four
months; but afterwards &s;uffer &s;uch de|cays in both, that they are no longer
to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the inhabitants by their com|plexion. However,
this languid and &s;piritle&s;s exi&s;tence is frequently drawled on
&s;ometimes even to eighty. Young per&s;ons are generally mo&s;t affected by
the heat of climate, which &s;pares the more aged; but all, upon their arrival
on the coa&s;ts, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame train of fatal di&s;|orders. Few
nations have experienced the mor|tality of the&s;e coa&s;ts, &s;o much as our
own: in our un&s;ucce&s;sful attack upon Carthagena, more than three parts of
our army were de&s;troyed by the climate alone; and tho&s;e that returned from 
<PB N="323" REF="346"> that fatal expedition, found their former vigour
irretrievably gone. In our more fortunate ex|pedition, which gave us the
Havannah, we had little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of our &s;ucce&s;s; in&s;tead of a
third, not a fifth part of the army were left &s;urvivors of their victory, the
climate being an enemy that even heroes cannot conquer.</P>
<P>The di&s;tempers that thus proceed from the cruel malignity of
tho&s;e climates, are many: that, for in&s;tance, called the Chapotonadas,
car|ries off a multitude of people; and extremely thins the crews of European
&s;hips, whom gain tempts into tho&s;e inho&s;pitable regions. The nature of
this di&s;temper is but little known, being cau&s;ed in &s;ome per&s;ons by
cold, in others by indige&s;tion. But its effects are far from being ob&s;cure;
it is generally fatal in three or four days: upon its &s;eizing the patient, it
brings on what is there called the black vomit, which is the &s;ad &s;ymptom
after which none are ever found to recover. Some, when the vomit attacks them,
are &s;eized with a delirium, that, were they not tied down, they would tear
them&s;elves to pieces, and thus expire in the mid&s;t of this fu|rious
paroxy&s;m. This di&s;order, in milder cli|mates, takes the name of the bilious
fever, and is attended with milder &s;ymptoms, but very dangerous in all.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="347">There are many other di&s;orders incident to
the human body, that &s;eem the offspring of heat; but to mention no other,
that very la&s;&s;itude which prevails in all the tropical climates, may be
con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e. The inhabitants of India<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amonitates, vol. v. p 444.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;ays a
modern philo&s;opher, &s;u&s;tain an uncea&s;ing languor, from the heats of
their cli|mate; and are torpid in the mid&s;t of profu&s;ion. For this
rea&s;on, the great Di&s;po&s;er of Nature has cloathed their country with
trees of an amazing height, who&s;e &s;hade might defend them from the beams of
the &s;un; and who&s;e continual fre&s;h|ne&s;s might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
temperate their fiercene&s;s. From the&s;e &s;hades, therefore, the air
receives refre&s;hing moi&s;ture, and animals a cool|ing protection. The whole
race of &s;avage ani|mals retire, in the mid&s;t of the day, to the very center
of the fore&s;ts, not &s;o much to avoid their enemy man, as to find a defence
again&s;t the raging heats of the &s;ea&s;on. This advantage which ari&s;es
from &s;hade in torrid climates, may probably afford a &s;olution for that
extraordinary circum|&s;tance related by Boyle, which he imputes to a different
cau&s;e. In the i&s;land of Ternate, be|longing to the Dutch, a place that had
been long celebrated for its beauty and healthfulne&s;s, the clove trees grew
in &s;uch plenty, that they in <PB N="325" REF="348"> &s;ome mea&s;ure
le&s;&s;ened their own value: for this rea&s;on, the Dutch re&s;olved to cut
down the fore&s;ts, and thus to rai&s;e the price of the commodity: but they
had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent of their avarice; for &s;uch a change en&s;ued,
by cutting down the trees, that the whole i&s;land, from being healthy and
delightful, having loft its charming &s;hades, became extremely &s;ickly, and
has actually continued &s;o to this day. Boerhaave con&s;idered heat &s;o
prejudicial to health, that he was never &s;een to go near a fire.</P>
<P>An oppo&s;ite &s;et of calamities are the con|&s;equence, in
climates where the air is conden&s;ed by cold. In &s;uch places, all that train
of di&s;tem|pers which are known to ari&s;e from ob&s;tructed per&s;piration,
are very common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's Hi&s;tory of Greenland,
vol. i. p. 235.</BIBL></NOTE>; eruptions, boils, &s;curvy, and a loath&s;ome
lepro&s;y, that covers the whole body with a &s;curf, and white putrid ulcers.
The&s;e di&s;orders al&s;o, are in|fectious; and, while they thus bani&s;h the
patient from &s;ociety, they generally accompany him to the grave. The men of
tho&s;e climates &s;eldom attain to the age of fifty; but the women, who do not
lead &s;uch laborious lives, are found to live longer.</P>
<P>The autumnal complaints which attend a wet <PB N="326" REF="349">
&s;ummer, indicate the dangers of a moi&s;t air. The long continuance of an
ea&s;t wind al&s;o, &s;hews the prejudice of a dry one. Mineral ex|halations,
when copious, are every where known to be fatal; and although we probably owe
the encrea&s;e and luxuriance of vegetation to a mo|derate degree of their
warmth, yet the natives of tho&s;e countries where there are mines in plenty,
but too often experience the noxious effects of their vicinity. Tho&s;e trades
al&s;o that deal in the preparations of metals of all kinds, are always
unwhol&s;ome; and the workmen, after &s;ome time, are generally &s;een to
labour under pal&s;ies, and other nervous complaints. The vapours from &s;ome
vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, are well known to be attended with dangerous effects.
The &s;hade of the machinel tree, in America, is &s;aid to be fatal; as was
that of the juniper, if we may credit the ancients. Tho&s;e who walk through
fields of poppies, or in any manner prepare tho&s;e flowers for making opium,
are very &s;en&s;ibly affected with the drow&s;ine&s;s they occa&s;ion. A
phy&s;ician of Mr. Boyle's acquaintance, cau&s;ing a large quantity of black
hellebore to be pounded in a mortar, mo&s;t of the per&s;ons who were in the
room, and e&s;pecially the per&s;on who pounded it, were purged by it, and
&s;ome of them &s;trongly. He al&s;o gathered a certain plant in Ireland, which
the per&s;on who beat in a mortar, and the <PB N="327" REF="350"> phy&s;ician
who was &s;tanding near, were &s;o &s;trongly affected by, that their hands and
faces &s;welled to an enormous &s;ize, and continued tumid for a long time
after.</P>
<P>But neither mineral nor vegetable &s;teams are &s;o dangerous to the
con&s;titution, as tho&s;e pro|ceeding from animal &s;ub&s;tances, putrefying
either by di&s;ea&s;e or death. The effluvia that comes from di&s;ea&s;ed
bodies, propagate that frightful catalogue of di&s;orders which are called
infectious. The parts which compo&s;e vegetable vapours, and mineral
exhalations, &s;eem gro&s;s and heavy, in compari&s;on of the&s;e volatile
vapours, that go to great di&s;tances, and have been de&s;cribed as &s;preading
de&s;olation over the whole earth. They fly every where; pene|trate every
where; and the vapours that fly from a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e, &s;oon render it
epidemic.</P>
<P>The plague is the fir&s;t upon the li&s;t in this cla&s;s of human
calamities. From whence this &s;courge of man's pre&s;umption may have its
beginning, is not well known; but we well know that it is propagated by
infection. What|ever be the general &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, we learn, from
experience, that the noxious vapours, though but &s;ingly introduced at
fir&s;t, taints the air by degrees: every per&s;on in|fected, tends to add to
the growing malignity; <PB N="328" REF="351"> and, as the di&s;order becomes
more general, the putre&s;cence of the air becomes more noxious, &s;o that the
&s;ymptoms are aggravated by con|tinuance. When it is &s;aid that the origin of
this di&s;order is unknown, it implies, that the air &s;eems to be but little
employed in fir&s;t pro|ducing it. There are &s;ome countries, even in the
mid&s;t of Africa, that we learn have never been in&s;ected with it; but
continue, for centuries, unmole&s;ted. On the contrary, there are others, that
are generally vi&s;ited once a year, as in Egypt, which, neverthele&s;s,
&s;eems peculiarly ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;erenity and temperature of its
climate. In the former countries, which are of va&s;t extent, and many of them
very populous, every thing &s;hould &s;eem to di&s;po&s;e the air to make the
plague continual among them. The great heats of the climate, the
unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the food, the &s;loth and dirt of the inhabitants, but,
above all, the bloody battles which are con|tinually fought among them, after
which heaps of dead bodies are left unburied, and expo&s;ed to putrefaction.
All the&s;e one might think would be apt to bring the plague among them; and
yet, neverthele&s;s, we are a&s;&s;ured by Leo Africanus, that in Numidia the
plague is not known once in an hundred years; and that in Negroland, it is not
known at all. This dread|ful di&s;order, therefore, mu&s;t have its ri&s;e, not
<PB N="329" REF="352"> from any previous di&s;po&s;ition of the air, but from
&s;ome particular cau&s;e, beginning with one individual, and extending the
malignity, by com|munication, till at la&s;t the air becomes actually tainted
by the generality of the infection.</P>
<P>The plague which &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole world, in the year
1346, as we are told by Me|zeray, was &s;o contagious, that &s;carce a village,
or even an hou&s;e, e&s;caped being infected by it. Before it had reached
Europe, it had been for two years travelling from the great kingdom of Cathay,
where it began by a vapour mo&s;t hor|ridly fetid; this broke out of the earth
like a &s;ubterranean fire, and upon the fir&s;t in&s;tant of its eruption,
con&s;umed and de&s;olated above two hundred leagues of that country, even to
the trees and &s;tones.</P>
<P>In that great plague which de&s;olated the city of London, in the
year 1665, a pious and learned &s;choolma&s;ter of Mr. Boyle's acquaint|ance,
who ventured to &s;tay in the city, and took upon him the humane office of
vi&s;iting the &s;ick and the dying, who had been de&s;erted by better
phy&s;icians, averred, that being once called to a poor woman who had buried
her children of the plague, he found the room where &s;he lay &s;o little that
it &s;carce could hold any more than the bed whereon &s;he was &s;tretched.
However, in this <PB N="330" REF="353"> wretched abode, be&s;ide her, in an
open coffin, her hu&s;band lay, who had &s;ome time before died of the &s;ame
di&s;ea&s;e; and whom &s;he, poor crea|ture, &s;oon followed. But what &s;hewed
the peculiar malignity of the air thus &s;uffering from animal putrefaction,
was, that the contagious &s;teams had produced &s;pots on the very wall of
their wretched apartment: and Mr. Boyle's own &s;tudy, which was contiguous to
a pe&s;t-hou&s;e, was al&s;o &s;potted in the &s;ame frightful manner. Happily
for mankind, this di&s;order, for more than a century, has not been known in
our i&s;land; and, for this la&s;t age, has abated much of its violence, even
in tho&s;e countries where it is mo&s;t common. Di&s;ea&s;es, like empires,
have their revolutions; and tho&s;e which for a while were the &s;courge of
mankind, &s;ink un|heard of, to give place to new ones, more dreadful, as being
le&s;s under&s;tood.</P>
<P>For this revolution in di&s;orders, which has employed the
&s;peculation of many, Mr. Boyle accounts in the following manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"Since," &s;ays he, "there want not cau&s;es in the
bowels of the earth, to make con&s;iderable changes among&s;t the materials
that nature has plentifully trea&s;ured up in tho&s;e magazines, and as tho&s;e
noxious &s;teams are abundantly &s;upplied to the &s;urface, it may not &s;eem
improbable, that in this <PB N="331" REF="354"> great variety, &s;ome may be
found capable of particularly affecting the human frame in a par|ticular
manner, and thus of producing new di&s;|ea&s;es. The duration of the&s;e may be
greater or le&s;s, according to the la&s;tingne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;ubter|raneous
cau&s;es that produced them. On which account, it need be no wonder that &s;ome
di&s;ea&s;es have but a &s;hort duration, and vani&s;h not long after they
appear; whil&s;t others may continue longer, as having under ground more
&s;ettled and durable cau&s;es to maintain them."</Q></P>
<P>From the recital of this train of mi&s;chiefs pro|duced by the air,
upon minerals, plants, animals, and man him&s;elf, a gloomy mind may be apt to
dread this indulgent nur&s;e of nature as a cruel and an inexorable
&s;tep-mother: but it is far other|wi&s;e; and, although we are &s;ometimes
injured, yet almo&s;t all the comforts and ble&s;&s;ings of life &s;pring from
its propitious influence. It would be needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that it is
ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of our lives; for of this, every
moment's experience a&s;&s;ures us. But how it contributes to this &s;upport,
is not &s;o readily comprehended. All allow it to be a friend, to who&s;e
benefits we are con&s;tantly obliged: and yet, to this hour, philo&s;ophers are
divided as to the nature of the obligation. The di&s;pute is, whether the air
is only u&s;eful by its weight to <PB N="332" REF="355"> force our juices into
circulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Keil. Robin&s;on.</BIBL></NOTE>; or,
whether, by containing a peculiar &s;pirit, it mixes with the blood in our
ve&s;&s;els, and acts like a &s;pur to their indu&s;try<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Whytt upon vital and in|voluntary
Motions.</BIBL></NOTE>. Perhaps it may exert both the&s;e u&s;eful offices at
the &s;ame time. Its weight may give the blood its progre&s;&s;ive motion,
through the larger ve&s;&s;els of the body; and its admixture with it, cau&s;e
tho&s;e contractions of all the ve&s;&s;els, which &s;erve to force it &s;till
more &s;trongly for|ward, through the minute&s;t channels of the cir|culation.
Be this as it may, it is well known, that that part of our blood which has
ju&s;t re|ceived the influx of the air in our bodies, is of a very different
colour from that which has almo&s;t performed its circuit. It has been found,
that the arterial blood which has been immediately mixed with the air in the
lungs, and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, is ju&s;t beginning its journey through
the body, is of a fine florid &s;carlet colour; while, on the contrary, the
blood of the veins that is returning from having performed its duty, is of a
blacki&s;h crim&s;on hue. Whence this difference of colour &s;hould proceed, is
not well under&s;tood: we only know the fact, that this florid colour is
communicated by the air; and we are well con|vinced, <PB N="333" REF="356">
that this air has been admitted into the blood for very u&s;eful
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this vital principle in animals, the air al&s;o gives life
and body to flame. A candle quickly goes out in an exhau&s;ted receiver; for
having &s;oon con&s;umed the quantity of air, it then expires, for want of a
fre&s;h &s;upply. There has been a flame contrived that will burn under water;
but none yet has been found, that will continue to burn without air. Gunpowder,
which is the mo&s;t catching and powerful fire we know, will not go off in an
exhau&s;ted re|ceiver; nay, if a train of gunpowder be laid, &s;o as that one
part may be fired in the open air, yet the other part in vacuo will remain
un|touched, and uncon&s;umed. Wood al&s;o &s;et on fire, immediately goes out;
and its flame cea&s;es upon removing the air; for &s;omething is then wanting
to pre&s;s the body of the fire again&s;t that of the fuel, and to prevent the
too &s;peedy dif|fu&s;ion of the flame. We frequently &s;ee cooks, and others,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to keep up &s;trong fires, take proper precautions
to exclude the beams of the &s;un from &s;hining upon them, which effectually
puts them out. This they are apt to a&s;cribe to a wrong cau&s;e; namely, the
operation of the light: but the real fact is, that <PB N="334" REF="357"> the
warmth of the &s;un-beams le&s;&s;en and di&s;&s;ipate the body of the air that
goes to feed the flame; and the fire, of con&s;equence, langui&s;hes for want
of a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply.</P>
<P>The air, while it thus kindles fire into flame, is notwith&s;tanding
found to moderate the rays of light, to di&s;&s;ipate their violence, and to
&s;pread an uniform lu&s;tre over every object. Were the beams of the &s;un to
dart directly upon us, with|out pa&s;&s;ing through this protecting medium,
they would either burn us up at once, or blind us with their effulgence. But by
going through the air, they are reflected, refracted, and turned from their
direct cour&s;e, a thou&s;and different ways; and thus are more evenly
diffu&s;ed over the face of nature.</P>
<P>Among the other nece&s;&s;ary benefits the air is of to us, one of
the principal is its conveyance of &s;ound. Even the vibrations of a bell,
which have the loude&s;t effect that we know of, cea&s;es to be heard, when
under the receiver of an air-pump. Thus all the plea&s;ures we receive from
conver&s;ation with each other, or from mu&s;ic, depend entirely upon the
air.</P>
<P>Odours likewi&s;e are diffu&s;ed only by the means of air; without
this fluid to &s;wim in, they would for ever remain torpid in their
re&s;pective <PB N="335" REF="358"> &s;ub&s;tances; and the ro&s;e would affect
us with as little &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, as the thorn on which it
grew.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are willing to augment the cata|logue of the benefits we
receive from this ele|ment, a&s;&s;ert al&s;o, that ta&s;tes them&s;elves would
be in&s;ipid, were it not that the air pre&s;&s;es their parts upon the nerves
of the tongue and palate, &s;o as to produce their grateful effects. Thus,
continue they, upon the tops of high moun|tains, as on the Pike of Teneriff,
the mo&s;t poignant bodies, as pepper, ginger, &s;alt, and &s;pice, have no
&s;en&s;ible ta&s;te, for want of their particles being thus &s;ent home to the
&s;en&s;ory. But, we owe the air &s;ufficient obligations, not to be &s;tudious
of admitting this among the num|ber: in fact, all &s;ub&s;tances have their
ta&s;tes, as well on the tops of mountains, as in the bottom of the valley; and
I have been one of many, who have ate a very &s;avoury dinner on the Alps.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, therefore, that we regard the air as the parent
of health and vegetation; as a kind di&s;pen&s;er of light and warmth; and as
the conveyer of &s;ounds and odours. This is an element of which avarice will
not deprive us; and which power cannot monopolize. The trea&s;ures of the
earth, the verdure of the fields, <PB N="336" REF="359"> and even the
refre&s;hments of the &s;tream, are too often &s;een going only to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the luxuries of the great; while the le&s;s fortunate part of mankind &s;tand
humble &s;pectators of their encroachments. But the air no limitations can
bound, nor any land-marks re&s;train. In this benign element, all mankind can
boa&s;t an equal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and for this we all have equal obligations
to Heaven. We con&s;ume a part of it, for our own &s;u&s;te|nance, while we
live; and, when we die, our putrefying bodies give back the &s;upply, which,
during life, we had accumulated from the ge|neral ma&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of Winds, irregular and regular.</HEAD>
<P>WIND is a current of air. Experimental philo&s;ophers produce an
artificial wind, by an in&s;trument called an aeolipile. This is nothing more
than an hollow copper ball, with a long pipe; a tea kettle might be readily
made into one, if it were entirely clo&s;ed at the lid, and the &s;pout left
open; through this &s;pout it is to be filled with water, and then &s;et upon
the fire, by which means it produces a violent bla&s;t, like wind, which
continues while there is any water remaining in the in&s;trument. In this
manner water is converted into a ru&s;hing air; which, if caught as it goes
out, and left to cool, is again quickly converted into its former element.
Be&s;ides this, as was mentioned in the former chapter, almo&s;t every
&s;ub&s;tance contains &s;ome portions of air. Vegetables, or the bodies of
animals left to putrefy, produce it in a very co|pious manner. But it is not
only &s;een thus e&s;|caping from bodies, but it may be very ea&s;ily made to
enter into them. A quantity of air may be compre&s;&s;ed into water, &s;o as to
be in|timately blended with it. It finds a much ea&s;ier admi&s;&s;ion into
wine, or any fermented <PB N="338" REF="361"> liquor; and an ea&s;ier &s;till,
into &s;pirits of wine. Some &s;alts &s;uck up the air in &s;uch quantities,
that they are made &s;en&s;ibly heavier thereby, and often are melted by its
moi&s;ture. In this man|ner, mo&s;t bodies, being found either capable of
receiving or affording it, we are not to be &s;ur|prized at tho&s;e &s;treams
of air that are continually fleeting round the globe. Minerals, vegetables, and
animals, contribute to encrea&s;e the current; and are &s;ending off their
con&s;tant &s;upplies. The&s;e, as they are differently affected by cold or
heat, by mixture or putrefaction, all yield dif|ferent quantities of air at
different times; and the loude&s;t tempe&s;ts, and mo&s;t rapid whirlwinds, are
formed from their united contributions.</P>
<P>The &s;un is the principal in&s;trument in rarefying the juices of
plants, &s;o as to give an e&s;cape to their impri&s;oned air; it is al&s;o
equally operative in promoting the putrefaction of animals. Mi|neral
exhalations are more frequently rai&s;ed by &s;ubterranean heat. The moon, the
other pla|nets, the &s;ea&s;ons, are all combined in producing the&s;e effects
in a &s;maller degree. Mountains give a direction to the cour&s;es of the air.
Fires carry a current of air along their body. Night and day alternately chill
and warm the earth, and produce an alternate current of its vapours. The&s;e,
and an hundred other cau&s;es, may be <PB N="339" REF="362"> a&s;&s;igned for
the variety, and the activity of the winds, their continual change, and
uncertain duration.</P>
<P>With us on land, therefore, as the wind pro|ceeds from &s;o many
cau&s;es, and meets &s;uch a variety of ob&s;tacles, there can be but little
hopes of ever bringing its motions to conform to theory; or of foretelling how
it may blow a minute to come. The great Bacon, indeed, was of opinion, that by
a clo&s;e and regular hi&s;tory of the winds, continued for a number of ages
to|gether, and the particulars of each ob&s;ervation reduced to general maxims,
we might at la&s;t come to under&s;tand the variations of this ca|pricious
element; and that we could foretell the certainty of a wind, with as much
ea&s;e as we now foretell the return of an eclip&s;e. Indeed, his own
beginnings in this arduous undertaking, &s;eem to &s;peak the po&s;&s;ibility
of its &s;ucce&s;s; but, unhappily for mankind, this inve&s;tigation is the
work of ages, and we want a Bacon to direct the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>To be able, therefore, with any plau&s;ibility, to account for the
variations of the wind upon land, is not to be at pre&s;ent expected; and to
under&s;tand any thing of their nature, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to tho&s;e
places where they are more permanent and &s;teady. This uniformity 
<PB N="340" REF="363"> and &s;teadine&s;s we are chiefly to expect upon the
ocean. There, where there is no variety of &s;ub&s;tances to furni&s;h the air
with various and incon&s;tant &s;upplies, where there are no moun|tains to
direct the cour&s;e of its current, but where all is exten&s;ively uniform and
even; in &s;uch a place, the wind ari&s;ing from a &s;imple cau&s;e, mu&s;t
have but one &s;imple motion. In fact, we find it &s;o. There are many parts of
the world where the winds, that with us are &s;o uncertain, pay their &s;tated
vi&s;its. In &s;ome places, they are found to blow one way by day, and another
by night; in others, for one half of the year, they go in a direction contrary
to their former cour&s;e: but what is more extraordinary &s;till, there are
&s;ome places where the winds never change, but for ever blow the &s;ame way.
This is particularly found to obtain between the tropics in the Atlantic and
Aethiopic oceans; as well as in the great Pacific &s;ea.</P>
<P>Few things &s;urely can appear more extra|ordinary to a per&s;on who
has never been out of our variable latitudes, than this &s;teady wind, that for
ever &s;its in the &s;ail, &s;ending the ve&s;&s;el forward; and as effectually
preventing its re|turn. He who has been taught to con&s;ider that nothing in
the world is &s;o variable as the winds, mu&s;t certainly be &s;urprized to
find a place where <PB N="341" REF="364"> there is nothing more uniform. With
us their incon&s;tancy has become a proverb; with the natives of tho&s;e
di&s;tant climates, they may talk of a friend or a mi&s;tre&s;s as fixed and
unchange|able as the winds, and mean a compliment by the compari&s;on. When our
&s;hips are once ar|rived into the proper latitudes of the great Pa|cific
ocean, the mariner forgets the helm, and his &s;kill becomes almo&s;t
u&s;ele&s;s: neither &s;torms nor tempe&s;ts are known to deform the gla&s;&s;y
bo&s;om of that immen&s;e &s;heet of waters; a gentle breeze, that for ever
blows in the &s;ame di|rection, re&s;ts upon the canvas, and &s;peeds the
navigator. In the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, &s;hips are thus known to cro&s;s an
immen&s;e ocean, that takes more than &s;o many months to return. Upon
returning, the trade-wind, which has been propitious, is then avoided; the
mariner is ge|nerally obliged to &s;teer into the northern lati|tudes, and to
take the advantage of every ca&s;ual wind that offers, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him into
port. This wind, which blows with &s;uch con&s;tancy one way, is known to
prevail not only in the Pacific ocean, but al&s;o in the Atlantic, between the
coa&s;ts of Guinea and Brazil; and, likewi&s;e, in the Aethiopic ocean. This
&s;eems to be the great univer&s;al wind, blowing from the ea&s;t to the 
<PB N="342" REF="365"> we&s;t, that prevails in all the exten&s;ive oceans
where the land does not frequently break the general current. Were the whole
&s;urface of the globe an ocean, there would probably be but this one wind, for
ever blowing from the ea&s;t, and pur&s;uing the motions of the &s;un
we&s;tward. All the other winds &s;eem &s;ubordinate to this; and many of them
are made from the de|viations of its current. To form, therefore, any
conception relative to the variations of the wind in general, it is fitte&s;t
to begin with that which never varies.</P>
<P>There have been many theories to explain this invariable motion of
the winds; among the re&s;t, we cannot omit that of Doctor Ly&s;ter, for its
&s;trangene&s;s. 
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;ea," &s;ays he, "in tho&s;e la|titudes, is
generally covered over with green weeds, for a great extent; and the air
produced from the vegetable per&s;piration of the&s;e, pro|duces the
trade-wind."</Q> The theory of Car|te&s;ius was not quite &s;o ab&s;urd. He
alledged, that the earth went round fa&s;ter than its atmo&s;phere at the
equator; &s;o that its motion, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, gave the atmo&s;phere an
imaginary one from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and thus an ea&s;t-wind was eternally
&s;een to prevail. Rejecting tho&s;e arbi|trary opinions, conceived without
force, and a&s;&s;erted without proof, Doctor Halley has given 
<PB N="343" REF="366"> one more plau&s;ible; which &s;eems to be the reigning
&s;y&s;tem of the day.</P>
<P>To conceive his opinion clearly, let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e the
whole &s;urface of the earth to be an ocean, and the air encompa&s;&s;ing it on
every &s;ide, without motion. Now it is evident, that that part of the air that
lies directly under the beams of the &s;un, will be rarefied; and if the &s;un
remained for ever in the &s;ame place, there would be a great vacuity in the
air, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, beneath the place where the &s;un &s;tood. But
the &s;un moving forward, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, this vacuity will follow too,
and &s;till be made under it. But while it goes on to make new vacuities, the
air will ru&s;h in to fill up tho&s;e the &s;un has already made; in other
words, as it is &s;till travelling forward, the air will continually be
ru&s;hing in behind, and pur&s;ue its motions from ea&s;t to we&s;t. In this
manner, the air is put into motion by day; and by night, the parts continue to
impel each other, till the next return of the &s;un, that gives a new force to
the circulation.</P>
<P>In this manner is explained the con&s;tant ea&s;t-wind that is found
blowing round the globe, near the equator. But it is al&s;o known, that as we
recede from the equator on either &s;ide, we come into a trade-wind, that
continually blows <PB N="344" REF="367"> from the poles, from the north on one
&s;ide, or the &s;outh on the other, both directing towards the equator. This
al&s;o proceeds from a &s;imilar cau&s;e with the former; for the air being
more rarefied in tho&s;e places over which the &s;un more directly darts its
rays, the currents will come both from the north and the &s;outh, to fill up
the intermediate vacuity.</P>
<P>The&s;e two motions, namely, the general one from ea&s;t to we&s;t,
and the more particular one from both the Poles, will account for all the
phae|nomena of trade-winds; which, if the whole &s;ur|face of the globe were
&s;ea, would undoubtedly be con&s;tant, and for ever continue to blow in one
direction. But there are a thou&s;and circum|&s;tances to break the&s;e
air-currents into &s;maller ones; to drive them back again&s;t their general
cour&s;e; to rai&s;e or depre&s;s them; to conden&s;e them into &s;torms; or to
whirl them in eddies. In con&s;equence of this, regard mu&s;t be often had to
the nature of the &s;oil, the po&s;ition of the high mountains, the cour&s;e of
the rivers, and even to the luxuriance of vegetation.</P>
<P>If a country lying directly under the &s;un, be very flat and
&s;andy, and if the land be low and exten&s;ive, the heats occa&s;ioned by the
reflection of the &s;un-beams, produces a very great rare|faction of the air.
The de&s;arts of Africa, which <PB N="345" REF="368"> are conformable to this
de&s;cription, are &s;carce ever fanned by a breath of wind by day; but the
burning &s;un is continually &s;een blazing in intolerable &s;plendor above
them. For this rea|&s;on, all along the coa&s;ts of Guinea, the wind is always
perceived blowing in upon land, in order to fill up the vacuity cau&s;ed by the
&s;un's ope|ration. In tho&s;e &s;hores, therefore, the wind blows in a
contrary direction to that of its ge|neral current; and is con&s;tantly found
&s;etting in from the we&s;t.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame cau&s;e it happens, that tho&s;e con&s;tant calms,
attended with deluges of rain, are found in the &s;ame part of the ocean. For
this tract being placed in the middle, between the we&s;terly winds blowing on
the coa&s;t of Guinea, and the ea&s;terly trade-winds that move at &s;ome
di&s;tance from &s;hore, in a contrary di|rection, the tendency of that part of
the air that lies between the&s;e two oppo&s;ite currents, is indifferent to
either, and &s;o re&s;ts between both in torpid &s;erenity; and the weight of
the incum|bent atmo&s;phere, being dimini&s;hed by the con|tinual contrary
winds blowing from hence, it is unable to keep the vapours &s;u&s;pended that
are copiou&s;ly borne thither; &s;o that they fall in con|tinual rains.</P>
<P>But it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any theory 
<PB N="346" REF="369"> can account for all the phaenomena of even tho&s;e winds
that are known to be mo&s;t regular. In|&s;tead, therefore, of a complete
&s;y&s;tem of the trade-winds, we mu&s;t rather be content with an imperfect
hi&s;tory. The&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
230.</BIBL></NOTE>, as was &s;aid, being the re&s;ult of a combination of
effects, a&s;&s;ume as great a variety as the cau&s;es producing them are
various.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the great general wind abovemen|tioned, in tho&s;e parts
of the Atlantic that lie under the temperate zone, a north wind pre|vails
con&s;tantly during the months of October, November, December, and January.
The&s;e, therefore, are the mo&s;t favourable months for embarking for the
Ea&s;t-Indies, in order to take the benefit of the&s;e winds, for cro&s;&s;ing
the line: and it has been often found, by experience, that tho&s;e who had
&s;et &s;ail five months before, were not in the lea&s;t farther advanced in
their voyage, than tho&s;e who waited for the favourable wind. During the
winter of Nova Zembla, and the other arctic countries, a north wind reigns
al|mo&s;t continually. In the Cape de Verde i&s;lands, a &s;outh wind prevails
during the month of July. At the Cape of Good Hope, a north-we&s;t wind blows
during the month of September. There are al&s;o regular winds, produced by
various cau&s;es, upon land. The ancient Greeks were the <PB N="347" REF="370">
fir&s;t who ob&s;erved a con&s;tant breeze, produced by the melting of the
&s;nows, in &s;ome high neigh|bouring countries. This was perceived in Greece,
Thrace, Macedonia, and the Aegean &s;ea. The &s;ame kind of winds are now
remarked in the kingdom of Congo, and the mo&s;t &s;outhern parts of Africa.
The flux and reflux of the &s;ea al&s;o produces &s;ome regular winds, that
&s;erve the purpo&s;es of trade; and, in general, it may be ob&s;erved, that
wherever there is a &s;trong current of water, there is a current of air that
&s;eems to attend it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e winds that are found to blow in one direction,
there are, as was &s;aid before, others that blow for certain months of the
year one way, and the re&s;t of the year the contrary way: the&s;e are called
the Mon&s;oons, from a famous pilot of that name, who fir&s;t u&s;ed them in
navigation with &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Varenii Geographia
Geurculis, cap. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>. In all that part of the ocean that lies
between Africa and India, the ea&s;t winds begin at the month of January, and
continue till about the commencement of June. In the month of Augu&s;t, or
September, the contrary direction takes place; and the we&s;t winds prevail for
three or four months. The interval between the&s;e winds, that is to &s;ay,
from the end of June to the beginning of <PB N="348" REF="371"> Augu&s;t, there
is no fixed wind; but the &s;ea is u&s;ually to&s;&s;ed by violent tempe&s;ts,
proceeding from the north. The&s;e winds are always &s;ubject to their
greate&s;t variations, as they approach the land; &s;o that on one &s;ide of
the great penin|&s;ula of India, the coa&s;ts are, for near half the year,
harra&s;&s;ed by violent hurricanes, and north|ern tempe&s;ts; while, on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and all along the coa&s;ts of Coromandel, the&s;e dread|ful
tempe&s;ts are wholly unknown. At Java, and Ceylon, a we&s;t wind begins to
reign in the month of September; but at fifteen days of &s;outh latitude, this
wind is found to be lo&s;t, and the great general trade-wind from the ea&s;t,
is perceived to prevail. On the contrary, at Co|chin, in China, the we&s;t wind
begins at March; &s;o that the&s;e Mon&s;oons prevail, at different
&s;ea|&s;ons, throughout the Indies. So that the ma|riner takes one part of the
year to go from Java to the Moluccas; another from Cochin to Mo|lucca; another
from Molucca to China; and &s;till another to direct him from China to
Japan.</P>
<P>There are winds al&s;o that may be con&s;idered as peculiar to
certain coa&s;ts; for example, the &s;outh wind is almo&s;t con&s;tant upon the
coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru; we&s;tern winds almo&s;t con&s;tantly prevail on
the coa&s;t of Terra Magellanica; and <PB N="349" REF="372"> in the environs of
the Streights le Maire. On the coa&s;ts of Malabar, north and north-we&s;t
winds prevail continually; along the coa&s;t of Guinea, the north-we&s;t wind
is al&s;o very fre|quent; and, at a di&s;tance from the coa&s;ts, the
north-ea&s;t is always found prevailing. From the beginning of November to the
end of Decem|ber, a we&s;t wind prevails on the coa&s;ts of Japan; and, during
the whole winter, no &s;hips can leave the port of Cochin, on account of the
impetuo&s;ity of the winds that &s;et upon the coa&s;t. The&s;e blow with
&s;uch vehemence that the ports are entirely choaked up with &s;and, and even
boats them&s;elves are not able to enter. However, the ea&s;t winds that
pre|vail for the other half of the year, clear the mouths of their harbours
from the accumu|lations of the preceding winter, and &s;et the confined &s;hips
at liberty. At the Streights of Babelmandel there is a &s;outh wind that
perio|dically returns, and which is always followed by a north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide winds thus peculiar to certain coa&s;ts, there are others
found to prevail on all the coa&s;ts, in warm climates; which, during one part
of the day, blow from the &s;hore, and, during another part of it, blow from
the &s;ea. The &s;ea-breeze, in tho&s;e countries, as Dampier 
<PB N="350" REF="373"> ob&s;erves, commonly ri&s;es in the morning, about nine,
proceeding &s;lowly, in a fine &s;mall black curl, upon the &s;urface of the
water, and making its way to refre&s;h the &s;hore. It is gentle at fir&s;t,
but encrea&s;es gradually till twelve, then in&s;en|&s;ibly &s;inks away, and
is totally hu&s;hed at five. Upon its cea&s;ing, the land-breeze begins to take
its turn, which increa&s;es till twelve at night, and is &s;ucceeded, in the
morning, by the &s;ea-breeze again. Without all doubt, nothing could have been
more fortunate, for the inha|bitants of the warm countries, where tho&s;e
breezes blow, than this alternate refre&s;hment, which they feel at tho&s;e
&s;ea&s;ons when it is mo&s;t wanted. The heat, on &s;ome coa&s;ts, would be
in&s;upportable, were it not for &s;uch a &s;upply of air, when the &s;un has
rarefied all that which lay more immediately under the coa&s;t. The
&s;ea-breeze temperates the heat of the &s;un by day; and the land-breeze
corrects the malig|nity of the dews, and vapours, by night. Where the&s;e
breezes, therefore, prevail, and they are very common, the inhabitants enjoy a
&s;hare of health, and happine&s;s, unknown to tho&s;e that live much farther
up the coun|try, or &s;uch as live in &s;imilar latitudes with|out this
advantange. The cau&s;e of the&s;e ob|viou&s;ly &s;eems to ari&s;e from the
rarefaction of <PB N="351" REF="374"> the air by the &s;un, as their duration
continues with its appearance, and alters when it goes down. The &s;un, it is
ob&s;erved, equally dif|fu&s;ing his beams upon land and &s;ea, the land, being
a more &s;olid body than the water, re|ceives a greater quantity of heat, and
reflects it more &s;trongly. Being thus, therefore, heated to a greater degree
than the waters, it, of con|&s;equence, drives the air from land out to &s;ea;
but, its influence being removed, the air re|turns to fill up the former
vacuity. Such is the u&s;ual method of accounting for this phaeno|mena; but,
unfortunately, the&s;e &s;ea and land breezes are vi&s;itants that come at all
hours. On the coa&s;ts of Malabar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 252.</BIBL></NOTE>, the land-breezes be|gin at midnight, and continue
till noon; then the &s;ea-breezes take their turn, and continue till midnight
again. While, again, at Congo, the land-breezes begin at five, and continue
till nine the next day.</P>
<P>But, if the cau&s;e of the&s;e be &s;o in&s;crutable, that are, as
we &s;ee, tolerably regular in their vi&s;itations, what &s;hall we &s;ay to
the winds of our own climate, that are continually &s;hifting, and incapable of
re&s;t? Some general cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned, which nothing but particular
ex|perience can apply. And, in the fir&s;t place, it <PB N="352" REF="375"> may
be ob&s;erved, that clouds, and heat, and, in &s;hort, whatever either
encrea&s;es the den&s;ity or the ela&s;ticity of the air, in any one place,
will produce a wind there: for the encrea&s;ed activity of the air thus
pre&s;&s;ing more powerfully on the parts of it that are adjacent, will drive
them forward, and thus go on, in a current, till the whole comes to an
equality.</P>
<P>In this manner, as a den&s;er air produces a wind, on the one hand;
&s;o will any accident, that contributes to lighten the air, produce it on the
other: for, a lighter air may be con&s;idered as a vacuity, into which the
neigh|bouring air will ru&s;h: and hence it happens, that when the barometer
marks a peculiar light|ne&s;s in the air, it is no wonder that it foretells a
&s;torm.</P>
<P>The winds upon large waters are generally more regular than tho&s;e
upon land. The wind at &s;ea generally blows with an even &s;teady gale; the
wind at land puffs by intervals, encrea&s;ing its &s;trength, and remitting it,
without any ap|parent cau&s;e. This, in a great mea&s;ure, may be owing to the
many mountains, towers, or trees, that it meets in its way, all contri|buting
either to turn it from its cour&s;e, or in|terrupt its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="376">The ea&s;t wind blows more con&s;tantly than
any other, and for an obvious rea&s;on: all other winds are, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, deviations from it, and partly may owe their origin thereto. It is
generally, likewi&s;e, the mo&s;t powerful, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>There are often double currents of the air. While the wind blows one
way, we frequently &s;ee the clouds move another. This is almo&s;t ever the
ca&s;e before thunder; for it is well known that the thunder cloud always moves
again&s;t the wind: the cau&s;e of this &s;urprizing appearance has hitherto
remained a &s;ecret. From hence we may conclude, that weathercocks only inform
us of that current of the air, which is near the &s;urface of the earth; but
are often erroneous with regard to the upper regions; and, in fact, Derham has
often found them erroneous.</P>
<P>Winds are generally more powerful on ele|vated &s;ituations than on
the plain, becau&s;e their progre&s;s is interrupted by fewer ob&s;tacles. In
proportion as we a&s;cend the heights of a moun|tain, the violence of the
weather &s;eems to en|crea&s;e, until we have got above the region of &s;torms,
where all is u&s;ually calm and &s;erene. Sometimes, however, the &s;torms
ri&s;e even to the tops of the highe&s;t mountains; as we learn from tho&s;e
who have been on the Andes, and <PB N="354" REF="377"> as we are convinced by
the deep &s;nows that crown even the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>Winds blowing from the &s;ea are generally moi&s;ter, and more
attended with rains, than tho&s;e which blow over exten&s;ive tracts of land:
for the &s;ea gives off more vapours to the air, and the&s;e are rolled forward
upon land, by the winds blowing from thence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham's Phi&s;ico Theol.</BIBL></NOTE>. For this rea&s;on
our ea&s;terly winds, that blow from the conti|nent, are dry, in compari&s;on
of tho&s;e that blow from the &s;urface of the ocean, with which we are
&s;urrounded on every other quarter.</P>
<P>In general the winds are more boi&s;terous in &s;pring and autumn,
than at other &s;ea&s;ons: for, that being the time of high tides, the &s;ea
may communicate a part of its motions to the winds. The &s;un, and moon,
al&s;o, which then have a greater effect upon the waters, may al&s;o have
&s;ome influence upon the winds; for, there being a great body of air
&s;urround|ing the globe, which, if conden&s;ed into water, would cover it to
the depth of thirty-two feet, it is evident that the &s;un and moon will, to a
proportionable degree, affect the atmo&s;phere, and make a tide of air. This
tide will be &s;carce perceivable, indeed; but, without doubt, it actu|ally
exi&s;ts; and may contribute to encrea&s;e the <PB N="355" REF="378"> vernal
and autumnal &s;torms, which are then known to prevail.</P>
<P>Upon narrowing the pa&s;&s;age through which the air is driven, both
the den&s;ity and the &s;wiftne&s;s of the wind is encrea&s;ed. For as
cur|rents of water flow with greater force and ra|pidity by narrowing their
channels, &s;o al&s;o will a current of air, driven through a contracted
&s;pace, grow more violent and irre&s;i&s;tible. Hence we find tho&s;e dreadful
&s;torms that pre|vail in the defiles of mountains, where the wind, pu&s;hing
from behind through a narrow chan|nel, at once encrea&s;es in &s;peed and
den&s;ity, le|velling, or tearing up, every ob&s;tacle that ri&s;es to
ob&s;truct its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Winds reflected from the &s;ides of moun|tains and towers, are often
found to be more forceful than tho&s;e in direct progre&s;&s;ion. This we
frequently perceive near lofty buildings, &s;uch as churches or &s;teeples,
where winds are generally known to prevail, and that much more powerful than at
&s;ome di&s;tance. The air, in this ca&s;e, by &s;triking again&s;t the &s;ide
of the building, acquires additional den&s;ity and, there|fore, blows with more
force.</P>
<P>The&s;e differing degrees of den&s;ity, which the air is found to
po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;ufficiently &s;hew that the force of the winds do not depend
upon their velo|city <PB N="356" REF="379"> alone; &s;o that tho&s;e
in&s;truments called <HI>anemometers,</HI> which are made to mea&s;ure the
ve|locity of the wind, will by no means give us certain information of the
force of the &s;torm. In order to e&s;timate this with exactne&s;s we ought to
know its den&s;ity; which al&s;o the&s;e are not cal|culated to di&s;cover. For
this rea&s;on we often &s;ee &s;torms, with very powerful effects, that do not
&s;eem to &s;hew any great &s;peed; and, on the con|trary, we &s;ee the&s;e
wind mea&s;urers go round, with great &s;wiftne&s;s, when &s;carce any damage
has followed from the &s;torm.</P>
<P>Such is the nature, and the incon&s;tancy, of the irregular winds
with which we are be&s;t acquainted. But their effects are much more formidable
in tho&s;e climates, near the tropics, where they are often found to break in
upon the &s;teady cour&s;e of the trade-winds, and to mark their pa&s;&s;age
with de&s;truction. With us the tempe&s;t is but rarely known, and its ra|vages
are regi&s;tered as an uncommon calamity; but, in the countries that lie
between the tro|pics, and for a good &s;pace beyond them, its vi&s;its are
frequent, and its effects anticipated. In the&s;e regions the winds vary their
terrors; &s;ometimes involving all things in a &s;uffocating heat; &s;ometimes
mixing all the elements of fire, air, earth, and water together; &s;ometimes,
with a momentary &s;wiftne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ing over the face <PB N="357" REF="380"> of the country, and de&s;troying all things in their pa&s;&s;age;
and &s;ometimes rai&s;ing whole &s;andy de&s;erts in one country, to depo&s;it
them upon &s;ome other. We have little rea&s;on, therefore, to envy the&s;e
climates, the luxuriance of their &s;oil, or the brightne&s;s of their &s;kies.
Our own muddy atmo&s;phere, that wraps us round in ob&s;curity, though it fails
to gild our pro&s;pects with &s;un-&s;hine, or our groves with fruitage,
ne|verthele&s;s an&s;wers the calls of indu&s;try. They may boa&s;t of a
plentiful, but precarious harve&s;t; while, with us, the labourer toils in a
certain expectation of a moderate, but an happy return.</P>
<P>In Egypt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
258</BIBL></NOTE>, a kingdom &s;o noted for its fertility, and the brightne&s;s
of its atmo&s;phere, during &s;ummer, the &s;outh winds are &s;o hot, that they
almo&s;t &s;top re&s;piration; be&s;ides which, they are charged with &s;uch
quantities of &s;and, that they &s;ometimes darken the air, as with a thick
cloud. The&s;e &s;ands are &s;o fine, and driven with &s;uch violence, that
they penetrate every where; even into che&s;ts, be they &s;hut never &s;o
clo&s;ely. If the&s;e winds happen to continue for any length of time, they
produce epidemic di&s;ea&s;es; and are often followed by a great mor|tality. It
is al&s;o found to rain but very &s;eldom in that country; however, the want of
&s;howers <PB N="358" REF="381"> is richly compen&s;ated by the copiou&s;ne&s;s
of their dews, which greatly tend to promote vegetation.</P>
<P>In Per&s;ia, the winter begins in November, and continues till
March. The cold at that time is inten&s;e enough to congeal the water; and
&s;now falls, in abundance, upon their mountains. Dur|ing the months of March
and April, winds ari&s;e, that blow with great force, and &s;eem to u&s;her in
the heats of &s;ummer. The&s;e return again, in autumn, with &s;ome violence;
without, how|ever, producing any dreadful effects. But, during their &s;ummer,
all along the coa&s;ts of the Per&s;ian Gulph, a very dangerous wind pre|vails,
which the natives call the Sameyel, &s;till more dreadful and burning than that
of Egypt, and attended with in&s;tant and fatal ef|fects. This terrible
bla&s;t, which was, perhaps, the pe&s;tilence of the ancients, in&s;tantly
kills all tho&s;e that it involves in its pa&s;&s;age. What its malignity
con&s;i&s;ts in, none can tell, as none have ever &s;urvived its effects, to
give information. It frequently, as I am told, a&s;&s;umes a vi&s;ible form;
and darts, in a kind of blui&s;h vapour, along the &s;urface of the country.
The natives, not only of Per&s;ia, but Arabia, talk of its ef|fects with
terror; and their poets have not failed to heighten them, with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of imagination. They have de&s;cribed it as un|der 
<PB N="359" REF="382"> the conduct of a mini&s;ter of vengeance, who governs
its terrors, and rai&s;es, or depre&s;&s;es it, as he thinks proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Herbelot. Bibliotheque Oriental.</BIBL></NOTE>. The&s;e
deadly winds are al&s;o known along the coa&s;ts of India, at Neca|patan,
Ma&s;ulipatan, and Petapoli. But, luckily for mankind, the &s;hortne&s;s of
their duration dimini&s;hes the injuries that might en&s;ue from their
malignity.</P>
<P>The Cape of Good Hope, as well as many i&s;lands in the
We&s;t-Indies, are famous for their hurricanes, and that extraordinary kind of
cloud which is &s;aid to produce them. This cloud, which is the fore-runner of
an approaching hurricane, appears, when fir&s;t &s;een, like a &s;mall black
&s;pot, on the verge of the horizon; and is called, by &s;ailors, the bull's
eye, from being &s;een &s;o minute at a va&s;t di&s;tance. All this time, a
per|fect calm reigns over the &s;ea and land, while the cloud grows gradually
broader as it ap|proaches. At length, coming to the place where its fury is to
fall, it inve&s;ts the whole horizon with darkne&s;s. During all the time of
its approach, an hollow murmur is heard in the cavities of the mountains; and
bea&s;ts and animals, &s;en&s;ible of its approach, are &s;een running over the
fields, to &s;eek for &s;helter. Nothing can be more terrible than its violence
when it begins. The hou&s;es in tho&s;e countries, <PB N="360" REF="383"> which
are made of timber, the better to re&s;i&s;t its fury, bend to the bla&s;t like
o&s;iers, and again recover their rectitude. The &s;un, which, but a moment
before, blazed with meridian &s;plendor, is totally &s;hut out; and a midnight
darkne&s;s prevails, except that the air is ince&s;|&s;antly illuminated with
gleams of lightening, by which one can ea&s;ily &s;ee to read. The rain falls,
at the &s;ame time, in torrents; and its de&s;cent has been re&s;embled to what
pours from the &s;pouts of our hou&s;es after a violent &s;hower. The&s;e
hurri|canes are not le&s;s offen&s;ive to the &s;en&s;e of &s;mell|ing al&s;o;
and never come without leaving the mo&s;t noi&s;ome &s;tench behind them. If
the &s;eamen al&s;o lay by their wet cloaths, for twenty-four hours, they are
all found &s;warming with little white maggots, that were brought with the
hur|ricane. Our fir&s;t mariners, when they vi&s;ited the&s;e regions, were
ignorant of its effects, and the &s;igns of its approach; their &s;hips,
therefore, were da&s;hed to the bottom at the fir&s;t on&s;et; and numberle&s;s
were the wrecks which the hurri|cane occa&s;ioned. But, at pre&s;ent, being
fore|warned of its approach, they &s;trip their ma&s;ts of all their &s;ails,
and thus patiently abide its fury. The&s;e hurricanes are common in all the
tro|pical climates. On the coa&s;ts of Guinea they have frequently three, or
four, in a day, that thus &s;hut out the heavens, for a little &s;pace; 
<PB N="361" REF="384"> and when pa&s;t leave all again in former &s;plen|dor.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey chiefly prevail, on that
coa&s;t, in the intervals of the trade winds; the approach of which clears the
air of its meteors, and gives the&s;e mortal &s;howers that little degree of
whole|&s;omene&s;s which they po&s;&s;e&s;s. They chiefly obtain there during
the months of April and May; they are known, at Loango, from January to April;
on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Africa, the hurricane &s;ea&s;on begins at May;
and, in general, whenever a trade wind begins to cea&s;e, the&s;e irregular
tempe&s;ts are found to exert their fury.</P>
<P>All this is terrible; but there is a tempe&s;t, known in tho&s;e
climates, more formidable than any we have hitherto been de&s;cribing, which is
called, by the Spaniards, a Tornado. As the former was &s;een arriving from one
part of the heavens, and making a line of de&s;truction; &s;o the winds in this
&s;eem to blow from every quarter, and &s;ettle upon one de&s;tined place, with
&s;uch fury, that nothing can re&s;i&s;t their vehemence. When they have all
met, in their central &s;pot, then the whirlwind begins with circular rapidity.
The &s;phere, every moment widens, as it con|tinues to turn, and catches every
object that lies within its attraction. This, al&s;o, like the former, is
preceded by a flattering calm; the air is every where hu&s;hed; and the &s;ea
is as <PB N="362" REF="385"> &s;mooth as poli&s;hed gla&s;s: however, as its
effects are more dreadful than tho&s;e of the ordinary hurricane, the mariner
tries all the power of his &s;kill to avoid it; which, if he fails of doing,
there is the greate&s;t danger of his going to the bottom. All along the
coa&s;ts of Guinea, beginning about two degrees north of the line, and &s;o
downward, lengthwi&s;e, for about a thou&s;and miles, and as many broad, the
ocean is unnavigable, upon account of the&s;e tornados. In this torpid region
there reigns uncea&s;ing tor|nados, or continual calms; among which, what|ever
&s;hip is &s;o unhappy as to fall, is totally deprived of all power of
e&s;caping. In this dreadful repo&s;e of all the elements, the &s;olitary
ve&s;&s;el is obliged to continue, without a &s;ingle breeze to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the mariner's wi&s;hes, except tho&s;e whirlwinds, which only &s;erve to
encrea&s;e his calamity. At pre&s;ent, therefore, this part of the ocean is
totally avoided; and, although there may be much gold along the coa&s;ts of
that part of Africa, to tempt avarice, yet there is &s;omething, much more
dreadful than the fabled dragon of antiquity, to guard the trea&s;ure. As the
internal parts of that country are totally unknown to travellers, from their
burning &s;ands and exten&s;ive de&s;arts, &s;o here we find a va&s;t tract of
ocean, lying off its &s;hores, equally unvi&s;ited by the mariner.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="386">But of all tho&s;e terrible tempe&s;ts that
deform the face of Nature, and repre&s;s human pre|&s;umption, the &s;andy
tempe&s;ts of Arabia and Africa, are the mo&s;t terrible, and &s;trike the
imagination mo&s;t &s;trongly. To conceive a pro|per idea of the&s;e, we are by
no means to &s;uppo&s;e them re&s;embling tho&s;e whirlwinds of du&s;t that we
&s;ometimes &s;ee &s;cattering in our air, and &s;prinkling their contents upon
our roads, or meadows. The &s;and-&s;torm of Africa, exhibits a very different
appearance. As the &s;and of which the whirl|wind is compo&s;ed, is
exce&s;&s;ively fine, and al|mo&s;t re&s;embles the parts of water, its motion
entirely re&s;embles that of a fluid; and the whole plain &s;eems to float
onward, like a &s;low inun|dation. The body of &s;and thus rolling, is deep
enough to bury hou&s;es and palaces in its bo|&s;om: travellers who are
cro&s;&s;ing tho&s;e exten&s;ive de&s;erts, perceive its approach at a
di&s;tance; and, in general, have time to avoid it, or turn out of its way, as
it generally extends but to a moderate breadth. However, when it is extremely
rapid, or very exten&s;ive, as &s;ometimes is the ca&s;e, no &s;wiftne&s;s, no
art, can avail; nothing then remains, but to meet death with fortitude, and
&s;ubmit to be buried alive with re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="387">It is happy for us of Britain, that we have no
&s;uch calamity to fear; for, from this, even &s;ome parts of Europe are not
entirely free. We have an account given us, in the Hi&s;tory of the French
Academy, of a mi&s;erable town in France, that is con&s;tantly in danger of
being buried under a &s;imilar inundation; with which I will take leave to
clo&s;e this chapter. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the neighbourhood of St. Paul de Leon, in Lower
Brittany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire de l'Accademic des Sciences,

which before the year 1666 was inha|bited, but now lies de&s;erted, by rea&s;on
of the &s;ands which cover it, to the height of twenty feet; and which every
year advance more and more in land, and gain ground continually. From the time
mentioned above, the &s;and has buried more than &s;ix leagues of the country
inward; and it is now but half a league from the town of St. Paul; &s;o that,
in all appearance, the inhabit|ants mu&s;t be obliged to abandon it entirely.
In the country that has been overwhelmed, there are &s;till to be &s;een the
tops of &s;ome &s;teeples peeping through the &s;and, and many chimnies that
&s;till remain above this &s;andy ocean. The inhabitants, however, had
&s;ufficient time to e&s;cape; but being deprived of their little all, they had
no other re|&s;ource <PB N="365" REF="388"> but begging for their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This calamity chiefly owes its advancement to a north, or an
ea&s;t-wind, rai&s;ing the &s;and, which is ex|tremely fine, in &s;uch great
quantities, and with &s;uch velocity, that M. De&s;lands, who gave the account,
&s;ays, that while he was walking near the place, during a moderate breeze of
wind, he was obliged, from time to time, to &s;hake the &s;and from his cloaths
and his hat, on which it was lodged in great quantities, and made them too
heavy to be ea&s;ily borne. Still further, when the wind was violent, it drove
the &s;and acro&s;s a little arm of the &s;ea, into the town of Ro&s;coff, and
covered the &s;treets of that place two feet deep; &s;o that they have been
obliged to carry it off in carts. It may al&s;o be ob|&s;erved, that there are
&s;everal particles of iron mixed with the &s;and, which are readily affected
by the load&s;tone. The part of the coa&s;t that furni&s;hes the&s;e &s;ands,
is a tract of about four leagues in length; and is upon a level with the &s;ea
at high-water. The &s;hore lies in &s;uch a manner as to leave its &s;ands
&s;ubject only to the north and ea&s;t winds, that bear them farther up the
&s;hore. It is ea&s;y to conceive how the &s;ame &s;and that has at one time
been borne a &s;hort way in land, may, by &s;ome &s;ucceeding and &s;tronger

its fer|tility. At the &s;ame time, the &s;ea, from whence this deluge of
&s;and proceeds, may furni&s;h it in inexhau&s;tible quantities. This unhappy

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Of Meteors, and &s;uch Appearances as re&s;ult from a
Combination of the Elements.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion as the &s;ub&s;tances of nature are more compounded
and combined, their appear|ances become more inexplicable and amazing. The
properties of water have been very nearly a&s;certained. Many of the qualities
of air, earth, and fire, have been di&s;covered, and e&s;timated; but when
the&s;e come to be united by Nature, they often produce a re&s;ult which no
artificial combinations can imitate; and we &s;tand &s;ur|prized, that although
we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which Nature makes u&s;e
of, &s;he &s;hews her&s;elf a much more various operator than the mo&s;t
&s;kilful chymi&s;t ever appeared to be. Every cloud that moves, and every
&s;hower that falls, &s;erves to mortify the philo&s;o|pher's pride, and to
&s;hew him hidden qualities in air and water, that he finds it difficult to
ex|plain. Dews, hail, &s;now, and thunder, are not le&s;s difficult for being
more common. Indeed, when we reflect on the manner in which Nature performs any
one of the&s;e operations, our wonder encrea&s;es. To &s;ee water, which is
heavier than air, ri&s;ing in air, and then falling in <PB N="368" REF="391"> a
form &s;o very different from that in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ro&s;e; to &s;ee the &s;ame fluid at one time de&s;cend|ing in the
form of hail, at another in that of &s;now; to &s;ee two clouds, by da&s;hing
again&s;t each other, producing an electrical fire, which no watery
compo&s;ition that we know of can ef|fect; the&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;erve
&s;ufficiently to excite our wonder; and &s;till the more, in proportion as the
objects are ever pre&s;&s;ing on our curio&s;ity. Much, however, has been
written concerning the manner in which Nature operates in the&s;e productions;
as nothing is &s;o ungrateful to mankind as hopele&s;s ignorance.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, with regard to the manner in which water evaporates,
and ri&s;es to form clouds, much has been advanced, and many theories
de|vi&s;ed. All water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Spectacle de la Nature,
vol. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;ay &s;ome, has a quantity of air mixed with it; and
the heat of the &s;un dart|ing down, di&s;engages the particles of this air
from the gro&s;&s;er fluid: the &s;un's rays being re|flected back from the
water, carry back with them tho&s;e bubbles of air and water which, being
lighter than the conden&s;ed air, will a&s;cend till they meet with a more
rarefied air; and they will then &s;tand &s;u&s;pended. Experience, how|ever,
proves nothing of all this. Particles of air or fire, are not thus known to
a&s;cend with a thin coat of water; and, in fact, we know that 
<PB N="369" REF="392"> the little particles of &s;team are &s;olid drops of
water. But be&s;ides this, water is known to eva|porate more powerfully in the
&s;evere&s;t fro&s;t, than when the air is moderately warm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires de l'Accademie des Sciences, an.
1705.</BIBL></NOTE>. Doctor Ha|milton, therefore, of the univer&s;ity of
Dublin, rejecting this theory, has endeavoured to e&s;ta|bli&s;h another.
According to him, as aqua fortis is a men&s;truum that di&s;&s;olves iron, and
keeps it mixed in the fluid; as aqua regia is a men&s;truum that di&s;&s;olves
gold; or as water di&s;&s;olves &s;alts to a certain quantity; &s;o air is a
men&s;truum that corrodes and di&s;&s;olves a certain quantity of water, and
keeps it &s;u&s;pended above. But how|ever ingenious this may be, it can hardly
be ad|mitted; as we know, by Marriotte's experi|ment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mariotte, de la Nature de l'Air, p. 97, 106.</BIBL></NOTE>,
that if water and air be enclo&s;ed toge|ther, in&s;tead of the air's acting as
a men&s;truum upon the water, the water will act as a men|&s;truum upon the
air, and take it all up. We know al&s;o, that of two bodies, that which is
mo&s;t fluid and penetrating, is mo&s;t likely to be the men&s;truum of the
other; but water is more fluid and penetrating than air, and, therefore, the
mo&s;t likely of the two to be the men&s;truum. We know that all bodies are
more &s;peedily acted upon, the more their parts are brought into con|tact 
<PB N="370" REF="393"> with the men&s;truum that di&s;&s;olves them: but water,
inclo&s;ed with compre&s;t air, is not the more dimini&s;hed thereby<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Boyle's Works, vol. ii. p. 619.</BIBL></NOTE>. In
&s;hort, we know, that cold, which dimini&s;hes the force of other
men&s;truums, is often found to promote evapo|ration. In this variety of
opinion, and uncer|tainty of conjecture, I cannot avoid thinking that a theory
of evaporation may be formed upon very &s;imple and obvious principles, and
embarra&s;&s;ed, as far as I can conceive, with very few objections.</P>
<P>We know that a repelling power prevails in nature, not le&s;s than
an attractive one. This repul&s;ion prevails &s;trongly between the body of
fire and that of water. If I plunge the end of a red hot bar of iron into a
ve&s;&s;el of water, the fluid ri&s;es, and large drops of it fly up in all
manner of directions, every part bubbling and &s;teaming until the iron be
cold. Why may we not, for a moment, compare the rays of the &s;un, darted
directly upon the &s;urface of the water, to &s;o many bars of red hot iron;
each bar, in|deed, infinitely &s;mall, but not the le&s;s powerful? In this
ca&s;e, wherever a ray of fire darts, the water, from its repul&s;ive quality,
will be driven on all &s;ides; and, of con&s;equence, as in the ca&s;e of the
bar of iron, a part of it will ri&s;e. The <PB N="371" REF="394"> parts thus
ri&s;ing, however, will be extremely &s;mall; as the ray that darts is
extremely &s;o. The a&s;&s;emblage of the rays darting upon the water in this
manner, will cau&s;e it to ri&s;e in a light thin &s;team above the &s;urface;
and as the parts of this &s;team are extremely minute, they will be lighter
than air, and, con&s;equently, float upon it. There is no need for
&s;uppo&s;ing them bubbles of water, filled with fire; for any &s;ub|&s;tance,
even gold it&s;elf, will float on air, if its parts be made &s;mall enough; or,
in other words, if its &s;urface be &s;ufficiently encrea&s;ed. This water,
thus di&s;engaged from the general ma&s;s, will be &s;till farther attenuated
and broken by the reflected rays, and, con&s;equently, more adapted for
a&s;cending.</P>
<P>From this plain account, every appearance in evaporation may be
ea&s;ily deduced. The quantity of heat encrea&s;es evaporation, becau&s;e it
rai&s;es a greater quantity of &s;team. The quan|tity of wind encrea&s;es
evaporation; for, by waving the &s;urface of the water, it thus expo&s;es a
greater &s;urface to the evaporating rays. A dry fro&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the quantity of evaporation; as the quantity of rays are found to
be no way dimini&s;hed thereby. Moi&s;t wea|ther alone prevents evaporation;
for the rays being ab&s;orbed, refracted, and broken, by the 
<PB N="372" REF="395"> intervening moi&s;ture, before they arrive at the
&s;urface, cannot produce the effect; and the va|pour will ri&s;e in a &s;mall
proportion.</P>
<P>Thus far we have accounted for the a&s;cent of vapours; but to
account for their falling again, is attended with rather more difficulty. We
have already ob&s;erved, that the particles of va|pour, di&s;engaged from the
&s;urface of the water, will be broken and attenuated in their a&s;cent, by the
reflected, and even the direct rays, that happen to &s;trike upon their minute
&s;urfaces. They will, therefore, continue to a&s;cend, till they ri&s;e above
the operation of the reflected rays, which reaches but to a certain height
above the &s;urface of the earth. Being arrived at this region, which is cold
for want of reflected heat, they will be conden&s;ed, and &s;u&s;pended in the
form of clouds. Some vapours that a&s;cend to great heights, will be frozen
into &s;now; others, that are conden&s;ed lower down, will put on the
appearance of a mi&s;t, which we find the clouds to be, when we a&s;cend among
them, as they hang along the &s;ides of a mountain. The&s;e clouds of &s;now
and rain, being blown about by winds, are either entirely &s;cattered and
di&s;per&s;ed above, or they are &s;till more conden&s;ed by motion, like a
&s;now-ball, that grows more large and &s;olid as it continues to roll. At
la&s;t, therefore, they will <PB N="373" REF="396"> become too weighty for the
air which fir&s;t rai&s;ed them, to &s;u&s;tain; and they will de&s;cend, with
their exce&s;s of weight, either in &s;now or rain. But as they will fall
precipitately, when they be|gin to de&s;cend, the air, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
will re&s;i&s;t the falling; for, as the de&s;cending fluid gathers velocity in
its precipitation, the air will encrea&s;e its re&s;i&s;tance to it, and the
water will, therefore, be thus broken into rain; as we &s;ee, that water which
falls from the tops of hou&s;es, though it begins in a &s;pout, &s;eparates
into drops before it has got to the bottom. Were it not for this happy
interpo&s;ition of the air, between us and the water falling from a
con&s;iderable height above us, a drop of rain might fall with dangerous force,
and an hail-&s;tone might &s;trike us with fatal rapidity.</P>
<P>In this manner, evaporation is produced by day; but when the &s;un
goes down, a part of that vapour which his rays had excited, being no lon|ger
broken, and attenuated by the reflecting rays, it will become heavier than the
air, even before it has reached the clouds; and it will, therefore, fall back
in dews, which differ only from rain in de&s;cending before they have had time
to conden&s;e into a vi&s;ible form.</P>
<P>Hail, the Carte&s;ians &s;ay, is a frozen cloud, half melted, and
frozen again in its de&s;cent. <PB N="374" REF="397"> An hoar-fro&s;t is but a
frozen dew. Lightening we know to be an electrical fla&s;h, produced by the
oppo&s;ition of two clouds: and thunder to be the &s;ound proceeding from the
&s;ame, continued by an echo reverberated among them. It would be to very
little purpo&s;e, to attempt explaining exactly how the&s;e wonders are
effected: we have as yet but little in&s;ight into the manner in which the&s;e
meteors are found to operate upon each other; and, therefore, we mu&s;t be
contented with a detail rather of their effects than their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In our own gentle climate, where Nature wears the milde&s;t and
kinde&s;t a&s;pect, every me|teor &s;eems to befriend us. With us, rains fall
in refre&s;hing &s;howers, to enliven our fields, and to paint the land&s;cape
with a more vivid beauty. Snows cover the earth, to pre&s;erve its tender
ve|getables from the inclemency of the departing winter. The dews de&s;cend
with &s;uch an imper|ceptible fall as no way injures the con&s;titution.
Thunder it&s;elf is &s;eldom injurious; and it is often wi&s;hed by the
hu&s;bandman, to clear the air, and to kill numberle&s;s in&s;ects that are
noxious to ve|getation. Hail is the mo&s;t injurious meteor that is known in
our climate; but it &s;eldom vi&s;its us with violence, and then its fury is
but tran&s;ient.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="398">One of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;torms we hear
of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p. 147.</BIBL></NOTE>,
was that at Hertford&s;hire, in the year 1697. It began by thunder and
lightening, which con|tinued for &s;ome hours, when &s;uddenly a black cloud
came forward, again&s;t the wind, and marked its pa&s;&s;age with
deva&s;tation. The hail-&s;tones which it poured down, being mea&s;ured, were
found to be many of them fourteen inches round, and, con&s;equently, as large
as a bowling-green ball. Wherever it came, every plantation fell before it; it
tore up the ground, &s;plit great oaks, and other trees, without number; the
fields of rye were cut down, as if levelled with a &s;cythe; wheat, oats, and
barley, &s;uffered the &s;ame damage. The inhabitants found but a pre|carious
&s;helter, even in their hou&s;es, their tiles and windows being broke by the
violence of the hail-&s;tones, which, by the force with which they came,
&s;eemed to have de&s;cended from a great height. The birds, in this
univer&s;al wreck, vainly tried to e&s;cape by flight; pidgeons, crows, rooks,
and much more of the &s;maller and feebler kinds, were brought down. An unhappy
young man, who had not time to take &s;helter, was killed; one of his eyes was
&s;truck out of his head, and his body was all over black with the brui&s;es:
another had ju&s;t time to e&s;cape, but not <PB N="376" REF="399"> without the
mo&s;t imminent danger, his body being brui&s;ed all over. But what is mo&s;t
ex|traordinary, all this fell within the compa&s;s of a mile.</P>
<P>Mezeray, in his Hi&s;tory of France, tells us of a &s;hower of hail
much more terrible, which hap|pened in the year 1510, when the French mo|narch
invaded Italy. There was, for a time, an horrid darkne&s;s, thicker than that
of midnight, which continued till the terrors of mankind were changed to
&s;till more terrible objects, by thunder and lightening breaking the gloom,
and bringing on &s;uch a &s;hower of hail, as no hi&s;tory of human calamities
could equal. The&s;e hail-&s;tones were of a blui&s;h colour; and &s;ome of
them weighed not le&s;s than an hundred pounds. A noi&s;ome vapour of &s;ulphur
attended the &s;torm. All the birds and bea&s;ts of the country were entirely
de&s;troyed. Numbers of the hu|man race &s;uffered the &s;ame fate. But what is
&s;till more extraordinary, the fi&s;hes them&s;elves found no protection from
their native element; but were equal &s;ufferers in the general cala|mity.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are terrors that are &s;eldom exerted in our mild
climates. They only &s;erve to mark the page of hi&s;tory with wonder; and
&s;tand as admonitions to mankind, of the va|rious &s;tores of puni&s;hment in
the hands of the <PB N="377" REF="400"> Deity, which his power can trea&s;ure
up, and his mercy can &s;u&s;pend.</P>
<P>In the temperate zones, therefore, meteors are rarely found thus
terrible; but between the tro|pics, and near the poles, they a&s;&s;ume very
dread|ful and various appearances. In tho&s;e incle|ment regions, where cold
and heat exert their chief power, meteors &s;eem peculiarly to have fixed their
re&s;idence. They are &s;een there in a thou&s;and terrifying forms,
a&s;toni&s;hing to Eu|ropeans, yet di&s;regarded by the natives, from their
frequency. The wonders of air, fire, and water, are there combined, to produce
the mo&s;t tremendous effects; and to &s;port with the la|bours and
apprehen&s;ions of mankind. Lighten|ings, that fla&s;h without noi&s;e;
hurricanes, that tear up the earth; clouds, that all at once pour down their
contents, and produce an in&s;tant de|luge; mock &s;uns; northern lights, that
illumi|nate half the hemi&s;phere; circular rainbows; halo's; fleeting balls of
fire; clouds, reflecting back the images of things on earth, like mirrors; and
water-&s;pouts, that bur&s;t from the &s;ea, to join with the mi&s;ts that hang
immediately above them. The&s;e are but a part of the phaenomena that are
common in tho&s;e countries; and from many of which, our own climate is, in a
great mea&s;ure, exempted.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="401">The meteors of the torrid zone, however, are
different from tho&s;e that are found near the po|lar circles: and it may
readily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in tho&s;e countries where the &s;un exerts the
greate&s;t force in rai&s;ing vapours of all kinds, there &s;hould be the
greate&s;t quantity of me|teors. Upon the approach of the winter months, as
they are called, under the line, which u&s;ually begin about May, the &s;ky,
from a fiery brightne&s;s, begins to be overca&s;t, and the whole horizon
&s;eems wrapt in a muddy cloud. Mi&s;ts and vapours &s;till continue to ri&s;e;
and the air, which &s;o lately before was clear and ela&s;tic, now becomes
humid, ob&s;cure, and &s;tifling: the fogs become &s;o thick, that the light of
the &s;un &s;eems in a manner excluded; nor would its pre|&s;ence be known, but
for the inten&s;e and &s;uffocat|ing heat of its beams, which dart through the
gloom, and, in&s;tead of di&s;&s;ipating, only &s;erve to encrea&s;e the
mi&s;t. After this preparation, there follows an almo&s;t continual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thunder, rain, and tempe&s;ts. During this dreadful
&s;ea|&s;on, the &s;treets of cities flow like rivers; and the whole country
wears the appearance of an ocean. The inhabitants often make u&s;e of this
oppor|tunity to lay in a &s;tock of fre&s;h water, for the re&s;t of the year;
as the &s;ame cau&s;e which pours <PB N="379" REF="402"> down the deluge at one
&s;ea&s;on, denies the kindly &s;hower at another. The thunder which attends
the fall of the&s;e rains, is much more terrible than that we are generally
acquainted with. With us, the fla&s;h is &s;een at &s;ome di&s;tance, and the
noi&s;e &s;hortly after en&s;ues; our thunder gene|nerally rolls on one quarter
of the &s;ky, and one &s;troke pur&s;ues another. But here it is other|wi&s;e;
the whole &s;ky, all around, &s;eems illumi|nated with unremitted fla&s;hes of
lightening; every part of the air &s;eems productive of its own thunders; and
every cloud produces its own &s;hock. The &s;trokes come &s;o thick, that the
inhabitants can &s;carce mark the intervals; but all is one unremitted roar of
elementary con|fu&s;ion. It &s;hould &s;eem, however, that the light|ening of
tho&s;e countries is not &s;o fatal, or &s;o dangerous, as with us; &s;ince, in
this ca&s;e, the torrid zone would be uninhabitable.</P>
<P>When the&s;e terrors have cea&s;ed, with which, however, the natives
are familiar, meteors of another kind begin to make their appearance. The
inten&s;e beams of the &s;un, darting upon &s;tagnant waters, that generally
cover the &s;urface of the country, rai&s;e vapours of various kinds. Floating
bodies of fire, which a&s;&s;ume different names, rather from their accidental
forms, than from any real difference between them, are &s;een 
<PB N="380" REF="403"> without &s;urprize. The draco volans, or flying dragon,
as it is called; the ignis fatuus, or wandering fire; the fires of St. Helmo,
or the mariner's light, are every where fre|quent; and of the&s;e we have
numberle&s;s de|&s;criptions. 
<Q REND="inline">"As I was riding in Jamaica," &s;ays, Mr. Barbham,
"one morning from my habitation, &s;ituated about three miles north|we&s;t from

into the town; but when I came nearer, I &s;aw many people gathered to|gether,
a little to the &s;outhward, in the Sa|vannah, to whom I rode up, to enquire
the cau&s;e of their meeting: they were admiring, as I found, the ground's
being &s;trangely broke up and ploughed by a ball of fire; which, as they
&s;aid, fell down there. I ob&s;erved there were many holes in the ground; one
in the middle of the bigne&s;s of a man's head, and five or &s;ix &s;maller
round about it, of the bigne&s;s of one's fi&s;t, and &s;o deep as not to be
fathomed by &s;uch implements as were at hand. It was ob|&s;erved, al&s;o, that
all the green herbage was burnt up, near the holes; and there continued a
&s;trong &s;mell of &s;ulphur near the place, for &s;ome time after."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"About nine at night," &s;ays he, "a globe of fire
appeared to ri&s;e from the &s;ide of the mountain Pichinca, and &s;o large,
that it &s;pread a light over all the part of the city facing that mountain.
The hou&s;e where I lodged, looking that way, I was &s;urprized with an
extraordinary light, darting through the crevices of the window-&s;hutters. On
this ap|pearance, and the bu&s;tle of the people, in the &s;treet, I ha&s;tened
to the window, and came time enough to &s;ee it, in the middle of its ca|reer;
which continued from we&s;t to &s;outh, till I lo&s;t &s;ight of it, being

apparent diameter about a foot. I ob|&s;erved it to ri&s;e from the &s;ides of

where this congeries of in|flammable matter was kindled. In the fir&s;t half of
its vi&s;ible cour&s;e it emitted a prodigious effulgence, then it began
gradually to grow dim; &s;o that, upon its di&s;appearing behind the
intervening mountain, its light was very faint."</Q></P>
<P>Meteors, of this kind, are very frequently &s;een between the
tropics; but they &s;ometimes, al&s;o, vi&s;it the more temperate regions of
Eu|rope. We have the de&s;cription of a very ex|traordinary 
<PB N="382" REF="405"> one, given us by Montanari, that &s;erves to &s;hew to
what great heights, in our atmo&s;phere, the&s;e vapours are found to a&s;cend.
In the year 1676, a great globe of fire was &s;een at Bononia, in Italy, about
three quarters of an hour after &s;un-&s;et. It pa&s;t we&s;tward, with a
mo&s;t rapid cour&s;e, and at the rate of not le&s;s than a hundred and &s;ixty
miles in a minute, which is much &s;wifter than the force of a can|non-ball,
and, at la&s;t, &s;tood over the Adriatic &s;ea. In its cour&s;e it cro&s;&s;ed
over all Italy; and, by computation, it could not have been le&s;s than
thirty-eight miles above the &s;urface of the earth. In the whole line of its
cour&s;e, wherever it approached, the inhabitants below could di|&s;tinctly
hear it, with a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, re&s;embling that of a fire-work. Having
pa&s;t away to &s;ea, towards Cor&s;ica, it was heard, at la&s;t, to go off
with a mo&s;t violent explo&s;ion, much louder than that of a cannon; and,
immediately after, ano|ther noi&s;e was heard, like the rattling of a great
cart, upon a &s;tony pavement; which was, pro|bably, nothing more than the echo
of the for|mer &s;ound. Its magnitude, when at Bononia, appeared twice as long
as the moon, one way; and as broad the other; &s;o that, con&s;idering its
height, it could not have been le&s;s than a mile long, and half a mile broad.
From the height <PB N="383" REF="406"> at which this was &s;een, and there
being no vol|cano, on that quarter of the world, from whence it came, it is
more than probable that this terrible globe was kindled on &s;ome part of the
contrary &s;ide of the globe, in tho&s;e regions of vapours, which we have been
ju&s;t de&s;cribing; and thus, ri&s;ing above the air, and pa&s;&s;ing, in a
cour&s;e oppo&s;ite to that of the earth's motion, in this manner it acquired
its amazing rapidity.</P>
<P>To the&s;e meteors, common enough &s;outh|ward, we will add one more
of a very uncommon kind, which was &s;een, by Ulloa, at Quito, in Peru; the
beauty of which will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erve to relieve us, after the
de&s;cription of tho&s;e hideous ones preceding. 
<Q REND="inline">"At day-break," &s;ays he, "the whole mountain of
Pambamarca, where we then re&s;ided, was encompa&s;&s;ed with very thick
clouds; which the ri&s;ing of the &s;un di&s;|per&s;ed &s;o far, as to leave
only &s;ome vapours, too fine to be &s;een. On the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the
ri&s;ing &s;un, and about ten fathoms di&s;tant from the place where we were
&s;tanding, we &s;aw, as in a looking-gla&s;s, each his own image; the head
being, as it were, the center of three cir|cular rainbows, one without the
other, and ju&s;t near enough to each other as that the colours of the internal
verged upon tho&s;e more ex|ternal; while round all was a circle of white, 
<PB N="384" REF="407"> but with a greater &s;pace between. In this man|ner
the&s;e circles were erected, like a mirror, before us; and as we moved, they
moved, in di&s;po&s;ition and order. But, what is mo&s;t re|markable, though we
were &s;ix in number, every one &s;aw the phenomenon, with regard to
him|&s;elf, and not that relating to others. The dia|meter of the arches
gradually altered, as the &s;un ro&s;e above the horizon; and the whole, after
continuing a long time, in&s;en&s;ibly faded away. In the beginning, the
diameter of the inward iris, taken from its la&s;t colour, was about five
degrees and a half; and that of the white arch, which &s;urrounded the re&s;t,
was not le&s;s than &s;ixty-&s;even degrees. At the beginning of the
phenomenon, the arches &s;eemed of an oval or eliptical figure, like the di&s;k
of the &s;un; and afterwards became perfectly circular. Each of the&s;e was of
a red colour, bordered with an orange; and the la&s;t bordered by a bright
yel|low, which altered into a &s;traw colour, and this turned to a green; but,
in all, the external colour remained red."</Q> Such is the de&s;cription of one
of the mo&s;t beautiful illu&s;ions that has been ever &s;een in nature. This
alone &s;eems to have combined all the &s;plendours of optics in one view. To
under&s;tand the manner, therefore, how this phaenomena was produced, 
<PB N="385" REF="408"> would require a perfect knowledge of optics; which it is
not our pre&s;ent province to enter upon. It will be &s;ufficient here,
therefore, only to ob&s;erve, that all the&s;e appearances ari&s;e from the
den&s;ity of the cloud, together with its uncommon and peculiar &s;ituation,
with re&s;pect to the &s;pectator and the &s;un. It may be ob&s;erved, that but
one of the&s;e three rain|bows was real, the re&s;t being only reflections
thereof. It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that when|ever the &s;pectator &s;tands
between the &s;un and a cloud of falling rain, a rainbow is &s;een, which is
nothing more than the reflection of the dif|ferent coloured rays of light from
the bo&s;om of the cloud. If, for in&s;tance, we take a gla&s;s globe, filled
with water, and hang it up before us, oppo&s;ite the &s;un, in many
&s;ituations, it will appear tran&s;parent; but if it is rai&s;ed higher, or
&s;ideways, to an angle of forty-five degrees, it will at fir&s;t appear red;
altered a very little higher, yellow; then green, then blue, then violet
colour; in &s;hort, it will a&s;&s;ume &s;ucce&s;&s;ively all the colours of
the rainbow; but, if rai&s;ed higher, &s;till it will become tran&s;parent
again. A falling &s;hower may be con&s;idered as an infinite number of the&s;e
little tran&s;parent globes, a&s;&s;uming dif|ferent colours, by being placed
at the proper heights. The re&s;t of the &s;hower will appear 
<PB N="386" REF="409"> tran&s;parent, and no part of it will &s;eem coloured;
but &s;uch as are at angles of forty-five degrees from the eye, forty-five
degrees upward, forty-five degrees on each &s;ide, and forty-five degrees
downward, did not the plain of the earth pre|vent us. We, therefore, &s;ee only
an arch of the rainbow, the lower part being cut off from our &s;ight by the
earth's interpo&s;ition. However, upon the tops of very high mountains,
circular rainbows are &s;een, becau&s;e we can &s;ee to an angle of forty-five
degrees downward, as well as upward, or &s;ideways, and therefore we take in
the rainbow's complete circle.</P>

frozen, and drop off.</P>
<P>There al&s;o, halos, or luminous circles round the moon, are oftener
&s;een than in any other part of the earth, being formed by the fro&s;t
&s;moke; although the air otherwi&s;e &s;eems to be clear. A lunar rainbow
al&s;o, is often &s;een there, though &s;omewhat different from that which is
common with us; as it appears of a pale white, &s;triped with grey. In the&s;e
countries al&s;o, the aurora borealis &s;treams, with peculiar lu&s;tre, and
variety of colours. In Greenland it gene|rally ari&s;es in the ea&s;t, and
darts its &s;portive fires, with variegated beauty, over the whole horizon. Its
appearance is almo&s;t con&s;tant in winter; and, at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when
the &s;un departs, to return no more for half a year, this meteor kindly
ri&s;es to &s;upply its beams, and affords &s;ufficient light for all the
purpo&s;es of exi&s;tence. However, in the very mid&s;t of their tedious night,
the inhabitants are not entirely for&s;aken. The tops of the mountains are
often &s;een painted with the red rays of the &s;un; and the poor Greenlander
from thence begins to date his chronology. It would appear whim&s;ical to read
a Greenland calendar, in which we might be told, that one of their chiefs,
having lived forty days, died, at la&s;t, of a good old age; and 
<PB N="388" REF="411"> that his widow continued for half a day, to deplore his
lo&s;s, with great fidelity, before &s;he admitted a &s;econd hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The meteors of the day, in the&s;e countries, are not le&s;s
extraordinary than tho&s;e of the night: mock &s;uns are often reflected upon
an oppo&s;ite cloud; and the ignorant &s;pectator fan|cies that there are often
three or four real &s;uns in the firmament at the &s;ame time. In this
&s;plen|did appearance the real &s;un is always readily known by its &s;uperior
brightne&s;s, every reflexion being &s;een with dimini&s;hed &s;plendour. The
&s;olar rainbow there is often &s;een different from ours. In&s;tead of a
plea&s;ing variety of colours, it appears of a pale white, edged with a
&s;tripe of du&s;ky yellow; the whole being reflected from the bo&s;om of a
frozen cloud.</P>
<P>But, of all the meteors which mock the imagi|nation with an
appearance of reality, tho&s;e &s;trange illu&s;ions that are &s;een there, in
fine &s;erene wea|ther, are the mo&s;t extraordinary and entertain|ing. 
<Q REND="inline">"Nothing," &s;ays Krantz, "ever &s;urprized me more,
than, on a fine warm &s;ummer's day, to perceive the i&s;lands that lie four
leagues we&s;t of our &s;hore, putting on a form quite different from what they
are known to have. As I &s;tood gazing upon them, they appeared, at fir&s;t,
infi|nitely greater than what they naturally are; and &s;eemed as if I viewed
them through a large <PB N="389" REF="412"> magnifying gla&s;s. They were not
thus only made larger, but brought nearer to me. I plainly de&s;cried every
&s;tone upon the land, and all the furrows filled with ice, as if I &s;tood
clo&s;e by. When this illu&s;ion had la&s;ted for a while, the pro&s;pect
&s;eemed to break up, and a new &s;cene of wonder to pre&s;ent it&s;elf. The
i&s;lands &s;eemed to travel to the &s;hore, and repre&s;ented a wood, or a
tall cut hedge. The &s;cene then &s;hifted, and &s;hewed the appearance of all
&s;orts of curious figures; as &s;hips with &s;ails, &s;treamers, and flags;
antique elevated ca&s;tles, with decayed turrets; and a thou&s;and forms, for
which fancy found a re&s;emblance in nature. When the eye had been &s;atisfied
with gazing, the whole groupe of riches &s;eemed to ri&s;e in air, and at
length vani&s;h into nothing. At &s;uch times the weather is quite &s;erene and
clear; but compre&s;t with &s;uch &s;ubtle vapours, as it is in very hot
weather; and the&s;e appearing be|tween the eye and the object, give it all
that variety of appearances which gla&s;&s;es of dif|ferent refrangibilities
would have done."</Q> Mr. Krantz ob&s;erves that, commonly a couple of hours
afterwards, a gentle we&s;t wind and a vi&s;ible mi&s;t follows, which puts an
end to this <HI>lu&s;us naturae.</HI></P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to &s;well this catalogue of meteors 
<PB N="390" REF="413"> with the names of many others, both in our own climate
and in other parts of the world. Such as falling &s;tars, which are thought to
be no more than unctuous vapours, rai&s;ed from the earth to &s;mall heights,
and continuing to &s;hine till that matter which fir&s;t rai&s;ed, and
&s;upported them, being burnt out, they fall back again to the earth, with
extingui&s;hed flame. Burning &s;pears, which are a peculiar kind of aurora
borealis; bloody rains which are &s;aid to be the excrements of an in&s;ect,
that at that time has been rai&s;ed into the air. Showers of &s;tones,
fi&s;hes, and ivy-berries, at fir&s;t, no doubt, rai&s;ed into the air by
tem|pe&s;ts, in one country, and falling at &s;ome con|&s;iderable di&s;tance,
in the manner of rain, to a&s;toni&s;h another. But omitting the&s;e, of which
we know little more than what is thus briefly mentioned, I will conclude this
chapter with the de&s;cription of a water-&s;pout; a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing
phenomenon; not le&s;s dreadful to ma|riners than a&s;toni&s;hing to the
ob&s;erver of na|ture.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;pouts are &s;een very commonly in the tropical &s;eas,
and &s;ometimes in our own. Tho&s;e &s;een by Tournefort, in the
Mediter|ranean, he has de&s;cribed as follows. 
<Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t of the&s;e," &s;ays this great
botani&s;t, "that we &s;aw, was about a mu&s;ket-&s;hot from our &s;hip. 
<PB N="391" REF="414"> There we perceived the water began to boil, and to
ri&s;e about a foot above its level. The water was agitated and whiti&s;h; and
above its &s;urface there &s;eemed to &s;tand a &s;moke, &s;uch as might be
imagined to come from wet &s;traw before it begins to blaze. It made a &s;ort
of a murmuring &s;ound, like that of a torrent, heard at a di&s;tance, mixed,
at the &s;ame time, with an hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, like that of a &s;erpent:
&s;hortly after we perceived a column of this &s;moke ri&s;e up to the clouds,
at the &s;ame time whirling about with great rapidity. It appeared to be as
thick as one's finger; and the former &s;ound &s;till continued. When this
di&s;appeared, after la&s;ting for about eight minutes, upon turning to the
oppo&s;ite quarter of the &s;ky, we perceived another, which began in the
manner of the former; pre&s;ently after a third appeared in the we&s;t; and
in&s;tantly be&s;ide it &s;till another aro&s;e. The mo&s;t di&s;tant of
the&s;e three could not be above a mu&s;ket-&s;hot from the &s;hip. They all
continued like &s;o many heaps of wet &s;traw &s;et on fire, that continued to
&s;moke, and to make the &s;ame noi&s;e as before. We &s;oon after per|ceived
each, with its re&s;pective canal, mount|ing up in the clouds, and &s;preading
where it touched; the cloud, like the mouth of a trum|pet, making a figure, to
expre&s;s it intelligibly, <PB N="392" REF="415"> as if the tail of an animal
were pulled at one end by a weight. The&s;e canals were of a whiti&s;h colour,
and &s;o tinged, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by the water which was contained in them;
for, previous to this, they were apparently empty, and of the colour of
tran&s;parent gla&s;s. The&s;e canals were not &s;traight, but bent in &s;ome
parts, and far from being perpendicular, but ri&s;ing in their clouds with a
very inclined a&s;cent. But what is very particular, the cloud to which one of
them was pointed happening to be driven by the wind, the &s;pout &s;till
continued to follow its motion, without being broken; and pa&s;&s;ing behind
one of the others, the &s;pouts cro&s;&s;ed each other, in the form of a St.
Andrew's cro&s;s. In the beginning they were all about as thick as one's
finger, except at the top, where they were broader, and two of them
di&s;|appeared; but &s;hortly after, the la&s;t of the three encrea&s;ed
con&s;iderably; and its canal, which was at fir&s;t &s;o &s;mall, &s;oon became
as thick as a man's arm, then as his leg, and at la&s;t thicker than his whole
body. We &s;aw di&s;tinctly, through this tran&s;parent body, the water, which
ro&s;e up with a kind of &s;piral motion; and it &s;ometimes dimini&s;hed a
little of its thickne&s;s, and again re&s;umed the &s;ame; &s;ome|times
widening at top, and &s;ometimes at bot|tom; <PB N="393" REF="416"> exactly
re&s;embling a gut filled with water, pre&s;&s;ed with the fingers, to make the
fluid ri&s;e, or fall; and I am well convinced, that this al|teration in the
&s;pout was cau&s;ed by the wind, which pre&s;&s;ed the cloud, and impelled it
to give up its contents. After &s;ome time its bulk was &s;o dimini&s;hed as to
be no thicker than a man's arm again; and thus, &s;welling and dimini&s;h|ing,
it at la&s;t became very &s;mall. In the end, I ob&s;erved the &s;ea which was
rai&s;ed about it to re&s;ume its level by degrees, and the end of the canal
that touched it to become as &s;mall as if it had been tied round with a cord;
and this continued till the light, &s;triking through the cloud, took away the
view. I &s;till, however, continued to look, expecting that its parts would
join again, as I had before &s;een in one of the others, in which the &s;pout
was more than once broken, and yet again came together; but I was
di&s;appointed, for the &s;pout appeared no more."</Q></P>
<P>Many have been the &s;olutions offered for this &s;urprizing
appearance. Mr. Buffon &s;uppo&s;es the &s;pout, here de&s;cribed, to proceed
from the operation of fire, beneath the bed of the &s;ea; as the waters at the
&s;urface are thus &s;een agi|tated. However, the &s;olution of Dr. Stuart is
not dive&s;ted of probability; who thinks it may <PB N="394" REF="417"> be
accounted for by &s;uction, as in the applica|tion of a cupping-gla&s;s to the
&s;kin.</P>
<P>Wherever &s;pouts of this kind are &s;een they are extremely dreaded
by mariners; for if they happen to fall upon a &s;hip they mo&s;t commonly
da&s;h it to the bottom. But, if the &s;hip be large enough to &s;u&s;tain the
deluge, they are at lea&s;t &s;ure to de&s;troy its &s;ails and rigging, and
render it un|fit for &s;ailing. It is &s;aid that ve&s;&s;els of any force
u&s;ually fire their guns at them, loaden with a bar of iron; and, if &s;o
happy as to &s;trike them, the water is in&s;tantly &s;een to fall from them,
with a dreadful noi&s;e, though without any further mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s whether we ought to reckon the&s;e &s;pouts called
typhons; which are &s;ome|times &s;een at land, of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e
&s;o often de&s;cribed by mariners, at &s;ea. as they &s;eem to differ in
&s;everal re&s;pects. That, for in&s;tance, ob&s;erved at Hatfield, in
York&s;hire, in 1687, as it is de&s;cribed by the per&s;on who &s;aw it,
&s;eems rather to have been a whirlwind than a water-&s;pout. The &s;ea&s;on in
which it appeared was very dry, the weather extremely hot, and the air very
cloudy. After the wind had blown for &s;ome time, with con|&s;iderable force,
and conden&s;ed the black clouds one upon another, a great whirling of the air 
<PB N="395" REF="418"> en&s;ued; upon which the center of the clouds, every now
and then, darted down, in the &s;hape of a thick long black pipe; in which the
re|lator could di&s;tinctly view a motion, like that of a &s;crew, continually
&s;crewing up to it&s;elf, as it were, whatever it happened to touch. In its
progre&s;s it moved &s;lowly over a grove of young trees, which it violently
bent, in a cir|cular motion. Going forward to a barn, it in a minute &s;tript
it of all the thatch, and filled the whole air with the &s;ame. As it came near
the relator, he perceived that its blackne&s;s pro|ceeded from a gyration of
the clouds, by con|trary winds, meeting in a point, or a center; and where the
greate&s;t force was exerted, there darting down, like an Archimedes's &s;crew,
to &s;uck up all that came in its way. Another which he &s;aw, &s;ome time
after, was attended with &s;till more terrible effects; levelling, or tearing
up great oak trees, catching up the birds in its vortex, and da&s;hing them
again&s;t the ground. In this manner it proceeded, with an audible whirling
noi&s;e, like that of a mill; and, at length, di&s;&s;olved, after having done
much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t &s;till continue to &s;u&s;pend our a&s;&s;ent as to
the nature even of the&s;e land &s;pouts; <PB N="396" REF="419"> &s;ince they
have been &s;ometimes found to drop, in a great column of water, at once upon
the earth, and produce an in&s;tant inundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. iv, p. 2, 108.</BIBL></NOTE>, which
could not readily have happened had they been cau&s;ed by the gyration of a
whirl|wind only. Indeed, every conjecture, regard|ing the&s;e meteors, &s;eems
to me entirely un&s;a|tisfactory. They &s;ometimes appear in the calme&s;t
weather at &s;ea, of which I have been an eye-witne&s;s; and, therefore,
the&s;e are not cau&s;ed by a whirlwind. They are always capped by a cloud;
and, therefore, are not likely to pro|ceed from fires at the bottom. They
change place; and, therefore, &s;uction &s;eems imprac|ticable. In &s;hort, we
&s;till want facts, upon which to build a rational theory; and, in&s;tead of
knowledge, we mu&s;t be contented with ad|miration. To be well acquainted with
the ap|pearances of Nature, even though we are ig|norant of their cau&s;es,
often con&s;titutes the mo&s;t u&s;eful wi&s;dom.</P>

<PB N="397" REF="420">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus gone through a particular de&s;cription of the earth,
let us now pau&s;e for a moment, to contemplate the great picture be|fore us.
The univer&s;e may be con&s;idered as the palace in which the Deity re&s;ides;
and this earth as one of its apartments. In this, all the meaner races of
animated nature mechanically obey him; and &s;tand ready to execute his
com|mands, without he&s;itation. Man alone is found refractory; he is the only
being endued with a power of contradicting the&s;e mandates. The Deity was
plea&s;ed to exert &s;uperior power in creating him a &s;uperior being; a being
endued with a choice of good and evil; and capable, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of
co-operating with his own in|tentions. Man, therefore, may be con&s;idered as a
limited creature, endued with powers imita|tive of tho&s;e re&s;iding in the
Deity. He is thrown into a world that &s;tands in need of his help; and has
been granted a power of producing harmony from partial confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>If, therefore, we con&s;ider the earth as al|lotted for our
habitation, we &s;hall find, that much has been given us to enjoy, and much 
<PB N="398" REF="421"> to amend; that we have ample rea&s;ons for our
gratitude, and &s;till more for our indu&s;try. In tho&s;e great outlines of
nature, to which art can|not reach, and where our greate&s;t efforts mu&s;t
have been ineffectual, God him&s;elf has fini&s;hed the&s;e with amazing
grandeur and beauty. Our be|neficent Father has con&s;idered the&s;e parts of
nature as peculiarly his own; as parts which no creature could have &s;kill or
&s;trength to amend: and therefore, made them incapable of alteration, or of
more perfect regularity. The heavens, and the firmament, &s;hew the wi&s;dom,
and the glory of the Workman. A&s;tronomers, who are be&s;t &s;killed in the
&s;ymmetry of &s;y&s;tems, can find nothing there that they can alter for the
better. God made the&s;e perfect, becau&s;e no &s;ubordinate being could
correct their defects.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we &s;urvey nature on this &s;ide, nothing can be
more &s;plendid, more cor|rect, or amazing. We there behold a Deity re&s;iding
in the mid&s;t of an univer&s;e, infinitely extended every way, animating all,
and cheer|ing the vacuity with his pre&s;ence! We behold an immen&s;e and
&s;hapele&s;s ma&s;s of matter, formed into worlds by his power, and
di&s;per&s;ed at inter|vals, to which even the imagination cannot travel! In
this great theatre of his glory, a thou|&s;and &s;uns, like our own, animate
their re&s;pec|tive <PB N="399" REF="422"> &s;y&s;tems, appearing and
vani&s;hing at divine command. We behold our own bright lumi|nary, fixed in the
center of its &s;y&s;tem, wheeling its planets in times proportioned to their
di|&s;tances, and at once di&s;pen&s;ing light, heat, and action. The earth
al&s;o is &s;een with its twofold motion; producing, by the one, the change of
&s;ea&s;ons; and, by the other, the grateful vici&s;&s;i|tudes of day and
night. With what &s;ilent mag|nificence is all this performed! with what
&s;eem|ing ea&s;e! The works of art are exerted with inter|rupted force; and
their noi&s;y progre&s;s di&s;covers the ob&s;tructions they receive: but the
earth, with a &s;ilent &s;teady rotation, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ents every
part of its bo&s;om to the &s;un; at once im|bibing nouri&s;hment and light
from that parent of vegetation and fertility.</P>
<P>But not only provi&s;ions of heat and light are thus &s;upplied, but
its whole &s;urface is covered with a tran&s;parent atmo&s;phere, that turns
with its motion, and guards it from external injury. The rays of the &s;un are
thus broken into a ge|nial warmth; and, while the &s;urface is a&s;&s;i&s;ted,
a gentle heat is produced in the bowels of the earth, which contributes to
cover it with ver|dure. Waters al&s;o are &s;upplied in healthful abundance, to
&s;upport life, and a&s;&s;i&s;t vegetation. Mountains ari&s;e, to diver&s;ify
the pro&s;pect, and <PB N="400" REF="423"> give a current to the &s;tream. Seas
extend from one continent to the other, repleni&s;hed with ani|mals, that may
be turned to human &s;upport; and al&s;o &s;erving to enrich the earth with a
&s;uffi|ciency of vapour. Breezes fly along the &s;urface of the fields, to
promote health and vegetation. The coolne&s;s of the evening invites to re&s;t;
and the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning renews for labour.</P>
<P>Such are the delights of the habitation that has been a&s;&s;igned
to man; without any one of the&s;e, he mu&s;t have been wretched; and none of
the&s;e could his own indu&s;try have &s;upplied. But while many of his wants
are thus kindly furni&s;hed, on the one hand, there are numberle&s;s
inconvenien|cies to excite his indu&s;try on the other. This habitation, though
provided with all the conve|niencies of air, pa&s;turage, and water, is but a
de&s;ert place, without human cultivation. The lowe&s;t animal finds more
conveniencies in the wilds of nature, than he who boa&s;ts him&s;elf their
lord. The whirlwind, the inundation, and all the a&s;perities of the air, are
peculiarly terrible to man, who knows their con&s;equences, and, at a
di&s;tance, dreads their approach. The earth it|&s;elf, where human art has not
pervaded, puts on a frightful gloomy appearance. The fore&s;ts are dark and
tangled; the meadows over-grown with rank weeds; and the brooks &s;tray without
a de|termined <PB N="401" REF="424"> channel. Nature, that has been kind to
every lower order of beings, has been quite neglectful with regard to him; to
the &s;avage uncontriving man the earth is an abode of de|&s;olation, where his
&s;helter is in&s;ufficient, and his food precarious.</P>
<P>A world thus furni&s;hed with advantages on one &s;ide, and
inconveniences on the other, is the proper abode of rea&s;on, is the fitte&s;t
to exerci&s;e the indu&s;try of a free and a thinking creature. The&s;e evils,
which art can remedy, and pre|&s;cience guard again&s;t, are a proper call for
the exertion of his faculties; and they tend &s;till more to a&s;&s;imilate him
to his Creator. God beholds, with plea&s;ure, that being which he has made,
converting the wretchedne&s;s of his natu|ral &s;ituation into a theatre of
triumph; bring|ing all the headlong tribes of nature into &s;ub|jection to his
will; and producing that order and uniformity upon earth, of which his own
heavenly fabric is &s;o bright an example.</P>
