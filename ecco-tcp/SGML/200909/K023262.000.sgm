<HEAD>LETTER FROM <HI>THOMAS PAINE &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>Augu&s;t, 3, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS cen&s;ure is but awkwardly &s;oftened by apology, I &s;hall offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful cri&s;is, to which your double politics have conducted the affairs of your country, requires an inve&s;tigation uncramped by ceremony.</P>
<P>There was a time when the fame of America, moral and po|litical, &s;tood fair and high in the world. The lu&s;tre of her revolution extended it&s;elf to every individual, and to be a ci|tizen of America, gave a title to re&s;pect in Europe. Neither meanne&s;s nor ingratitude had then mingled in the compo&s;ition of her character. Her re&s;i&s;tances to the attempted tyranny of England left her un&s;u&s;pected of the one, and her open ac|knowledgment of the aid &s;he received from France precluded all &s;u&s;picion of the other. The politics of Wa&s;hington had not then appeared.</P>
<P>At the time I left America (April 1787) the continental Convention, that formed the federal con&s;titution, was on the point of meeting. Since that time new &s;chemes of politics, and new di&s;tinctions of parties, have ari&s;en. The term <HI>An|tifederali&s;t</HI> has been applied to all tho&s;e who combated the de|fects of that con&s;titution, or oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of your admini&s;tration. It was only to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tab|li&s;hing &s;ome federal authority, extending equally over all the States, that an in&s;trument &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent as the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titution is, obtained a &s;uffrage. I would have voted for it my&s;elf, had I been in America, or even for a wor&s;e, rather than have had none; provided it contained the means of re|medying its defects by the &s;ame appeal to the people, by which it was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is always better policy to leave removable errors to expo&s;e them&s;elves, than to hazard too much in contending again&s;t them theoretically.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">I have introduced the&s;e ob&s;ervations not only to mark the general difference between Antifederali&s;t and Anticon&s;titution|ali&s;t, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of the&s;e terms to my&s;elf. I declare my&s;elf oppo&s;ed to &s;everal matters in the con&s;titution, particularly to the man|ner in which what is called the executive is formed, and to the long duration of the &s;enate; and it I live to return to America, I will u&s;e all my endeavours to have them altered. I al&s;o de|clare my&s;elf oppo&s;ed to almo&s;t the whole of your admini&s;tra|tion; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not perfidious, as I &s;hall &s;how in the cour&s;e of this letter. But as to the point of con&s;olidating the States into a federal government, it &s;o happens, that the propo&s;ition for that purpo&s;e came originally from my&s;elf. I propo&s;ed it in a letter to chancellor Living&s;ton in the &s;pring of the year 1782, whil&s;t that gentleman was mi|ni&s;ter for foreign affairs. The five per cent duty recommended by congre&s;s had then fallen through, having been adopted by &s;ome of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode I&s;land, and repealed by Virginia, after it had been con&s;ented to. The propo&s;al in the letter I allude to, was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legi&s;lative body to Congre&s;s; for in order to have any law of the Union uni|form, the ca&s;e could only be, that either Congre&s;s, as it then &s;tood, mu&s;t frame the law, and the States &s;everally adopt it without alteration, or, the States mu&s;t elect a continental le|gi&s;lature for the purpo&s;e. Chancellor Living&s;ton, Robert Morris, Governor Morris, and my&s;elf, had a meeting at the hou&s;e of Robert Morris on the &s;ubject of that letter. There was no diver&s;ity of opinion on the propo&s;ition for a continen|tal legi&s;lature: the only difficulty was on the manner of bring|ing the propo&s;ition forward. For my own part, as I con&s;idered it as a remedy in re&s;erve, that could be applied at any time, <HI>when the States &s;aw them&s;elves wrong enough to be put right</HI> (which did not appear to be the ca&s;e at that time,) I did not fee the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publi&s;her of it my&s;elf. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will &s;carcely have the hardine&s;s to apply to me the term of Antifederali&s;t. But I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this. for the propo&s;ition for electing a conti|nental convention. To form the continental government is one of the &s;ubjects treated of in the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbi&s;h that might otherwi&s;e have lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titution and your admini&s;tra|tion began. It was very well &s;aid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that <HI>"thirteen
<PB N="3" REF="4">&s;taves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel;"</HI> and as any kind of hooping the barrel. however defectively executed, would be better than none, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible but that con&s;ide|rable advantages mu&s;t ari&s;e from the federal hooping of the States. It was with plea&s;ure that every &s;incere friend to Ame|rica beheld as the natural effect of union, her ri&s;ing pro&s;perity, and it was with grief they &s;aw that pro&s;perity mixed, even in the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">om, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your admini&s;tration almo&s;t in the moment of its commencement. The lands obtained by the revolution were lavi&s;hed upon partizans; the intere&s;t of the di&s;banded &s;oldier was &s;old to the &s;peculator; inju&s;tice was acted under the pre&s;ence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron of the fraud. From &s;uch a beginning what el&s;e could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e expected, than what has happened? A mean and &s;ervile &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the in&s;ults of one nation; treachery and ingratitude to another.</P>
<P>Some vices make their approach with &s;uch a &s;plendid ap|pearance, that we &s;carcely know to what cla&s;s of moral di&s;|tinctions they belong. They are rather virtues corrupted than vices originally. But meanne&s;s and ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are &s;o originally vice, that they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into ex|i&s;tence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found protection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>As the federal con&s;titution is a copy, though not quite &s;o ba&s;e a the original, of the form of the Briti&s;h government, an imitation of its vices was naturally to be expected. So inti|mate is the connection between <HI>form</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progre&s;|&s;ive, and is rapidly &s;o in matters that are vicious.</P>
<P>Soon after the federal con&s;titution arrived in England, I re|ceived a letter from a female literary corre&s;pondent (a native of New York) very well mixed with friend&s;hip, &s;entiment, and politics. In my an&s;wer to that letter, I permitted my&s;elf to ramble into the wilderne&s;s of imagination, and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition of America. I had no idea that the picture I then drew was reali&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;till le&s;s that Mr. Wa&s;hington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is congenial with the &s;ubject I am upon, I here tran|&s;cribe it:</P>
<Q><P>You touch me on a very tender point, when you &s;ay, <HI>that my friends on your &s;ide the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America even for my native England.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5">They are right. I had rather &s;ee my hor&s;e Button eating the gra&s;s of Bordentown or Morri&s;&s;ania, than &s;ee all the pomp and &s;hew of Europe.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and year hence, for I mu&s;t indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in le&s;s, America may be what England now is. The innocence of her character, that won the hearts of all na|tions in her favour, may &s;ound like a romance, and her inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that liberty, which thou&s;ands bled to obtain, may ju&s;t furni&s;h materials for a village tale, or extort a &s;igh from ru&s;tic &s;en|&s;ibility: while the fa&s;hionable of that day, enveloped in diffication, &s;hall deride the principle, and deny the fact.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the fall of empires, and the ex|tinction of the nations of the ancient world, we &s;ee but little more to excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyra|mids, and walls and towers of the mo&s;t co&s;tly workman|&s;hip: but when the empire of America &s;hall fall, the &s;ub|ject for contemplative &s;orrow will be infinitely greater than crumbling bra&s;s, or marble can in&s;pire. It will not then be &s;aid. Here &s;tood a temple of va&s;t antiquity, here ro&s;e a Babel of invi&s;ible height, or there a Palace of &s;um|tuous extravagance; but, Here, ah painful thought! the noble&s;t work of human wi&s;dom, the greate&s;t &s;cene of human glory, the fair cau&s;e of freedom, ro&s;e and fell: Read this, and then a&s;k if I forget America!</P></Q>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed as I was, with apprehen&s;ions of this kind, I had America con&s;tantly in my mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The Fir&s;t, and &s;till more, the Second Part of the Rights of Man, bear evident marks of this watchful|ne&s;s; and the di&s;&s;ertations on Fir&s;t Principles of Government goes more directly to the point than either of the former. I now pa&s;s on to other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It will be &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e into who&s;e hands this letter may fall, that I have &s;ome per&s;onal re&s;entment again&s;t you: and I will therefore &s;ettle this point before I proceed further.</P>
<P>If I have any re&s;entment, you mu&s;t acknowledge that I have not been ha&s;ty in declaring it, neither would it now be declared (for what are private re&s;entments to the public) if the cau&s;e of it did not unite it&s;elf as well with your public as with your private character, and with the motives of your political conduct.</P>
<P>The part I acted in the American revolution is well known. I &s;hall not here repeat it. I know al&s;o, that, had it not been for the aid received from France, in men, money, and &s;hips, your cold and unmilitary conduct (as I &s;hall &s;hew in the cour&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="6">of this letter) would in all probability have lo&s;t America; at lea&s;t &s;he would not have been the independant nation &s;he now is. You &s;lept away your time in the field, till the finances of the country were completely exhau&s;ted, and you have but little &s;hare in the glory of the final event. It is time, &s;ir, to &s;peak the undi&s;gui&s;ed language of hi&s;torical truth.</P>
<P>Elevated to the chair of the pre&s;idency, you a&s;&s;umed the merit of every thing to your&s;elf; and the natural ingratitude o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your con&s;titution began to appear. You commenced your pre&s;idental career by encouraging and &s;wallowing the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation; and you travelled America from one end to the other to put your&s;elf in the way of receiving it. You have as many addre&s;&s;es in your che&s;t as James the Second. As to what were your views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expre&s;&s;ions of your own; but the par|tizans of your politics have divulged the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>John Adams has &s;aid, (and John it is known was always a &s;peller after places and offices, and never thought his little &s;er|vices were highly enough paid) John has &s;aid, that as Mr. Wa&s;hington had no child, the pre&s;idency &s;hould be made he|reditary in the family of Lun Wa&s;hington. John might then have counted upon &s;ome &s;inecure for him&s;elf, and a provi&s;ion for his de&s;cendants. He did not go &s;o far as to &s;ay al&s;o, that the vice pre&s;idency &s;hould be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He prudently left that to &s;tand upon the ground, that one good turn de&s;erves another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two per&s;ons, to whom John Adams &s;aid this, told me of it. The &s;ecretary of Mr. Jay was pre&s;ent when it was told to me.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Adams is one of tho&s;e men who never contemplated the origin of government, or comprehended any thing of fir&s;t principles. If he had, he might have &s;een, that the right to &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary government never did, and never can, exi&s;t in any generation at any time whatever; that it is of the nature of trea&s;on, becau&s;e it is an attempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all &s;ucceeding generations. It is of a degree beyond com|mon trea&s;on; it is a &s;in again&s;t nature. The equal rights of generations it is a right fixed in the nature of things, it belongs to the &s;on when of age, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would him&s;elf deny the right that any former de|cea&s;ed generation could have to decree authoritatively a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of governors over him or over his children, and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a&s;&s;umes a pretended right, trea&s;onable as it is, of acting it him|&s;elf. His ignorance is his be&s;t excu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">John Jay has &s;aid, (and this John was always the &s;ycophant of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America, to Gren|ville in England) John Jay has &s;aid, that the &s;enate &s;hould have been appointed for life. He would then have been &s;ure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for him&s;elf, and have hand no fears about impeachment. The&s;e are the di&s;gui&s;ed traitors that call them&s;elves federali&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. John Jay de&s;ires to know on what authority I &s;ay this, I will give that authority publicly when he cho&s;es to call for it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Could I have known to what degree of corruption and per|fidy the admini&s;trative part of the government of America had de&s;cended, I could have been at no lo&s;s to have under&s;tood the re&s;ervedne&s;s of Mr. Wa&s;hington towards me during my impri|&s;onment in the Luxembourg. There are ca&s;es in which &s;ilence is a loud language. I will here explain the cau&s;e of that impri|&s;onment, and return to Mr. Wa&s;hington afterwards.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of that rage, terror and &s;u&s;picion, which the brutal letter of the Duke of Brun&s;wick fir&s;t &s;tarted into exi&s;t|ence in France, it happened that almo&s;t every man who was oppo&s;ed to violence, or who was not violent him&s;elf, became &s;u&s;pected. I had con&s;tantly been oppo&s;ed to every thing which was of the nature, or of the appearance of violence; but as I had always done it in a manner that &s;hewed it to be a principle founded in my heart, and not a political manoeuvre, it precluded the pretence of accu&s;ing me. I was reached however under another pretence.</P>
<P>A decree was pa&s;&s;ed to impri&s;on all per&s;ons born in England; but as I was a member of the Convention, and had been com|plimented with the honorary &s;tyle of citizen of France, as Mr. Wa&s;hington and &s;ome other Americans have been, this decree fell &s;hort of reaching me. A motion was afterwards, made and carried, &s;upported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oi&s;e, for expelling foreigners from the Convention. My expul&s;ion being thus affected, the two committees of public &s;afety and of general &s;urety, of which Robe&s;pierre was the dictator, put me in ar|re&s;tation under the former decree for impri&s;oning per&s;ons born in England. Having thus &s;hewn under what pretence the impri&s;onment was affected, I come to &s;peak of &s;uch parts of the ca&s;e as apply between me and Mr. Wa&s;hington, either as a pre&s;ident, or as an individual.</P>
<P>I have always con&s;idered that a foreigner, &s;uch as I was in fact, with re&s;pect to France, might be a member of a conven|tion for framing a con&s;titution, without affecting his right of citizen&s;hip, in the country to which he belongs, but not a
<PB N="7" REF="8">member of a government after a con&s;titution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this di&s;tinction. To be a member of a government requires a per&s;on being in allegiance with that government and to the country locally. But a con&s;titu|tion, being a thing of principle, and not of action, and which after it is formed, is to be referred to the people for their ap|probation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the per|&s;ons forming and propo&s;ing it; and be&s;ides this, it is only to the thing after it is formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to the country after its governmental character is fixed by the adoption of a con&s;titution, that the allegiance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizen&s;hip was required of the members who compo&s;ed the Convention: there was nothing exi&s;ting in form to &s;wear allegiance to. If any &s;uch condition had been re|quired, I could not, as citizen of America, in fact, though citizen of France by compliment, have accepted a &s;eat in the Convention.</P>
<P>As my citizen&s;hip in America was not altered or dimini&s;hed by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary, it ought to have been con&s;idered as &s;trengthened, for it was the Ameri|can principle of government that I was endeavouring to &s;pread in Europe), and as it is the duty of every government to charge it&s;elf with the care of any of its citizens who may happen to fall under an arbitrary per&s;ecution abroad, and this is al&s;o one of the rea&s;ons for which amba&s;&s;adors or mini&s;ters are appointed, it was the duty of the executive department in America, to have made, at lea&s;t &s;ome, enquiries about me, as &s;oon as it heard of my impri&s;onment. But if this had not been the ca&s;e, that government owed it to me on every ground and principle of honour and gratitude. Mr. Wa&s;hington owed it to me on every &s;core of private acquaintance, I will not now &s;ay friend&s;hip; for it has &s;ome time been known by tho&s;e who know him, that he has no friend&s;hips, that he is incapable of forming any; he can &s;erve or de&s;ert a man, or a cau&s;e, with con&s;titutional indifference; and it is this cold hermaphrodite faculty that impo&s;ed it&s;elf upon the world, and was credited a while by enemies, as by friends for prudence, moderation, and impartiality.</P>
<P>Soon after I was put into arre&s;tation, and impri&s;onment in the Luxembourg, the Americans who were then in Paris, went in a body to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me. They were an&s;wered by the then pre&s;ident Vadier, who has &s;ince ab&s;conded, that <HI>I was born in England,</HI> and it was &s;ig|nified to them, by &s;ome of the committee of general &s;urety, to whom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varennes), that their reclamation of me was only the act of
<PB N="8" REF="9">individuals, without any authority from the American govern|ment.</P>
<P>A few days after this, all communication between per&s;ons impri&s;oned, and any per&s;on without the pri&s;on was cut off by an order of the police. I neither &s;aw nor heard from any body for &s;ix months; and the only hope that remained to me was, that a new mini&s;ter would arrive from America to &s;uper|&s;ede Morris, and that he would be authori&s;ed to inquire into the cau&s;e of my impri&s;onment: but even this hope, in the &s;tate to which matters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any con&s;olatory effect, and I contented my&s;elf with the thought that I might be remembered when it would be too late. There is, perhaps, no condition from which a man, con&s;cious of his own uprightne&s;s, cannot derive con&s;olation; for it is in it&s;elf a con&s;olation for him to find, that he can bear that condition with calmne&s;s and fortitude.</P>
<P>From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Ro|be&s;pierre, July 29, (9th of Thermidor) the &s;tate of things in the pri&s;ons was a continued &s;cene of horror. No man could count upon life for twenty hours. To &s;uch a pitch of rage and &s;u&s;picion, were Robe&s;pierre and his committee ar|rived, that it &s;eemed as if they feared to leave a man to live. Scarcely a night pa&s;&s;ed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or more, were not taken out of the pri&s;on, carried be|fore a pretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined be|fore night. One hundred and &s;ixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night, in the month of July, and one hundred and &s;ixty of them guillotined. A li&s;t of two hun|dred more, according to the report in the pri&s;on, was prepar|ing a few days before Robe&s;pierre fell. In this la&s;t li&s;t I have good rea&s;on to believe I was included. A memorandum in the hand writing of Robe&s;pierre was afterwards produced in the Convention, by the committee to whom the papers of Robe&s;pierre were referred, in the&s;e words: <Q>Demander que Thomas Paine &s;oit decret&eacute; d'ac|cu&s;ation pour l'inter&eacute;t de l'Amerique, autant que de la France.</Q> <Q>Demand that Thomas Paine, be decreed of accu&s;a|tion for the intere&s;t of America, as well as of France.</Q></P>
<P>I had been impri&s;oned &s;even months, and the &s;ilence of the executive part of the government of America (Mr. Wa&s;hing|ton) upon the ca&s;e, and upon every thing re&s;pecting me, was explanation enough to Robe&s;pierre that he might proceed to extremities.</P>
<P>A violent fever which had nearly terminated my exi&s;tence,
<PB N="9" REF="10">was, I believe, the circum&s;tance that pre&s;erved it. I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was pa&s;|&s;ing, or of what had pa&s;&s;ed, for more than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The fir&s;t thing I was informed of was the fall of Robe&s;pierre.</P>
<P>About a week after this, Mr. Monroe arrived to &s;uper&s;ede Governor Morris, and as &s;oon as I was able to write a note le|gible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the pri&s;on; and who&s;e unabated friend&s;hip to me, from whom he had never received any &s;ervice, and with difficulty accepted any recompence, puts the character of Mr. Wa&s;hington to &s;hame.</P>
<P>In a few days I received a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Monroe, con|veyed to me in a note from an intermediate per&s;on, with a&s;|&s;urance of his friend&s;hip, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that I would re&s;t the ca&s;e in his hands. After a fortnight or more had pa&s;|&s;ed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, reque&s;ting him to in|form me what was the true &s;ituation of things with re&s;pect to me. I was &s;ure that &s;omething was the matter, I began to have hard thoughts of Mr. Wa&s;hington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.</P>
<P>In about ten days, I received an an&s;wer to my letter, in which the writer &s;ays, <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no order (meaning from the pre&s;ident, Mr. Wa&s;hington) re&s;pecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe) will do every thing in his power to liberate you; but, from what I learn from the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not con|&s;idered, either by the American government, or by indi|viduals, as an American citizen.</Q></P>
<P>I was now at no lo&s;s to under&s;tand Mr. Wa&s;hington and his newfangled faction, and that their policy was &s;ilently to leave me to fall in France. They were ru&s;hing as fa&s;t as they could venture, without awakening the jealou&s;y of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the Briti&s;h government; and it was no more con&s;i&s;tent with the policy of Mr. Wa&s;h|ington, and tho&s;e who immediately &s;urrounded him, than it was with that of Robe&s;pierre or of Pitt, that I &s;hould &s;urvive. They have, however, mi&s;&s;ed the mark, and the reaction is up|on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon the receipt of the letter ju&s;t alluded to, I &s;ent a me|morial to Mr. Monroe, which the reader will find in the ap|pendix, and I received from him the following an&s;wer. It is dated the 18th of September, but did not come to hand till about the 18th of October. I was then falling into a relap&s;e, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not be
<PB N="10" REF="11">had, and the ab&s;ce&s;s in my &s;ide, the con&s;equence of tho&s;e things, and of want of air and exerci&s;e, was beginning to form, and has continued immoveable ever &s;ince. Here fol|lows Mr. Monroe's letter.</P>

<P>I was favoured, &s;oon after my arrival here, with &s;everal letters from you, and more latterly with one in the character of memorial upon the &s;ubject of your confinement; and &s;hould have an&s;wered them at the times they were re&s;pectively written, had I not concluded, you would have calculated with certainty upon the deep intere&s;t I take in your welfare, and the plea&s;ure with which I &s;hall embrace every opportunity in my power to &s;erve you. I &s;hould &s;till pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e, and for rea&s;ons which mo&s;t obvious occur, if I did not find that you are di&s;quieted with apprehen&s;ions upon intere&s;ting points, and which ju&s;tice to you and our country equally forbid you &s;hould entertain. You mention that you have been informed you are not con&s;idered as an American citizen by the Ameri|cans, and that you have likewi&s;e heard that I had no in&s;truc|tions re&s;pecting you by the government. I doubt not the per&s;on who gave you the information meant well, but I &s;u&s;|pect he did not even convey accurately his own ideas on the fir&s;t point: for I pre&s;ume the mo&s;t he could &s;ay is, that you had likewi&s;e become a French citizen, and which by no means de|prived you of being an American one. Even this however, may be doubted. I mean the acqui&s;ition of citizen&s;hip in France, and I confe&s;s you have &s;aid much to &s;how that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not been made. I really &s;u&s;pect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote to you, and tho&s;e Americans he heard &s;peak upon the &s;ubject, meant. It becomes my duty, how|ever to declare to you, that I con&s;ider you as an American citizen, and that you are con&s;idered univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in that cha|racter by the people of America. As &s;uch you are entitled to my attention; and &s;o far as it can be given con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e obligations which are mutual between every government and even a tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;enger, you &s;hall receive it.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s have never decided upon the &s;ubject of citi|zen&s;hip, in a manner to regard the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. By being with us through the revolution, you are of our country as ab|&s;olutely as if you had been born there, and you are no more of England, than every native American is. This is the true doctrine in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;o far as it becomes complicated with any other con&s;ideration. I have mentioned it to make
<PB N="11" REF="12">you ea&s;y upon the only point which could give you any di&s;|quietude</P>
<P>Is it nece&s;&s;ary for me to tell you how much all your coun|trymen, I &s;peak of the great ma&s;s of the people, are inte|re&s;ted. in your welfare! They have not forgotten the hi&s;tory or their own revolution, and the difficult &s;cenes through which they pa&s;&s;ed; nor do they review its &s;everal &s;tages with|out reviving in their bo&s;oms a due &s;en&s;ibility of the merits of tho&s;e who &s;erved them in that great and arduous conflict. The crime of ingratitude has not yet &s;tained, and I tru&s;t never will &s;tain, our national character. You are con&s;idered by them, as not only having rendered important &s;ervices in our own revolution, but as being, on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale, the friend of human rights, and a di&s;tingui&s;hed and able advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans are not, nor can they be, indifferent.</P>
<P>Of the &s;en&s;e which the Pre&s;ident has always entertained of your merits, and of his friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards you, you are too well a&s;&s;ured, to require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wi&s;hes in &s;eeking your &s;afety is what I well know; and this will form an additional obligation on me to perform what I &s;hould otherwi&s;e con&s;ider as a duty.</P>
<P>You are in my opinion, at pre&s;ent menaced by no kind of danger. To liberate you, will be an object of my endeavours, and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But you mu&s;t, until that event &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, bear your &s;ituation with patience and for|titude; you will likewi&s;e have the ju&s;tice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I pre&s;ume alludes to the embarra&s;&s;ments which the &s;irange conduct of Governor Morris had occa&s;ioned, and which.

</LETTER>
<P>The part in Mr. Monroe's letter, in which he &s;peaks of the Pre&s;ident, (Mr Wa&s;hington) is put in &s;oft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Wa&s;hington had &s;aid formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only that Mr. Wa&s;hington had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the letter &s;tated; but he did not &s;o much as &s;ay to him, inquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in pri&s;on or out, or &s;ee if there be any a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can give him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">While the&s;e matters were pa&s;&s;ing, the liberations from the pri&s;ons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the cour&s;e of almo&s;t every twenty-four hours. The continuance of my impri&s;onment after a new mini&s;ter had arrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a matter &s;o obviou&s;ly &s;trange, that I found the character of the American government &s;poken of in very unqualified terms of reproach; not only by tho&s;e who &s;till remained in pri&s;on, but by tho&s;e who were liberated, and by per&s;ons who had acce&s;s to the pri&s;on from without. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occa&s;ion to &s;ay, among other things, <Q>It will not add to the popularity of Mr. Wa&s;hington, to have it believed in America, as it is be lieved here, that he connives at my impri&s;onment.</Q></P>
<P>The ca&s;e, &s;o far as it re&s;pected Mr. Monroe, was, that hav|ing to get over the difficulties, which the &s;trange conduct of Governor Morris had thrown in the way of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and having no authority from the American government, to &s;peak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found him&s;elf ob|liged to proceed by unofficial means with individual members; for though Robe&s;pierre was overthrown, the Robe&s;pierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety, &s;till remained in con&s;iderable force, and had they found out, that Mr. Monroe had no official authority upon the ca&s;e, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean time my health was &s;uffering exceedingly, the dreary pro&s;pect of winter was coming on; and impri&s;onment was &s;till a thing of danger. After the Robe&s;pierrian members of the Com|mittee were removed, by the expiration of their time of &s;erv|ing, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was liberated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning of Augu&s;t before. All that period of my impri&s;onment, at lea&s;t, I owe not to Robe&s;pierre, but to his colleague in pro|jects, George Wa&s;hington. Immediately upon my liberation, Mr. Monroe invited me to his hou&s;e, where I remained more than a year and half; and I &s;peak of his aid and friend&s;hip, as an open-hearted man will always do in &s;uch a ca&s;e, with re&s;pect and gratitude.</P>
<P>Soon after my liberation the Convention pa&s;&s;ed an unani|mous vote, to invite me to return to my &s;eat among them. The times were &s;till un&s;ettled and dangerous, as well from without as within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the con&s;titution not &s;ettled. I cho&s;e, however, to accept the in|vitation; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing al&s;o to &s;how, that, as I was not of a ca&s;t of mind, to be de|terred by pro&s;pects or retro&s;pects of danger, &s;o neither were
<PB N="13" REF="14">my principles to be weakened by misfortune or perverted by di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Being now once more abroad in the world, I began to find that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfa|vourable opinion of Mr. Wa&s;hington; it was evident that his character was on the decline as well among Americans, as among foreigners of different nations. From being the chief of the government, he had made him&s;elf the chief of a party; and his integrity was que&s;tioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Jay to London, notwith&s;tanding there was an American mini&s;ter there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in my&s;te|ry, which every day &s;erved either to increa&s;e or to explain into matter of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Wa&s;hington, as pre&s;ident, had &s;ent Governor Morris to London, as his &s;ecret agent, to have &s;ome communication with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. To cover the agency of Morris it was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Morris, to borrow money in Europe, and the report was per|mitted to pa&s;s uncontradicted. The event of Morris's nego|ciation was, that Mr. Hammond was &s;ent mini&s;ter from Eng|land to America, Pinkney from America to England, and him&s;elf mini&s;ter to France. If, while Morris was mini&s;ter in France, he was not an emi&s;&s;ary of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try and the coale&s;ced powers, he gave &s;trong rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of it. No one who &s;aw his conduct, and heard his conver&s;ation, could doubt his being in their intere&s;t; and had he not got off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in arre&s;tation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was making after him.</P>
<P>A great bu&s;tle has been made by Mr. Wa&s;hington about the conduct of Genet in America, whil&s;t that of his own mini&s;ter, Morris, in France was infinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or ra&s;h, he was not treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re|volution, in every &s;tage of it. But notwith&s;tanding this con|duct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Wa&s;hington, in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint and reque&s;t of the Committee of Public Safety, a&s;&s;ures him, that though he had complied with that reque&s;t, he &s;till retained the &s;ame e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for him as before. This letter Morris was fooli&s;h enough to tell of; and, as his own character and con|duct
<PB N="14" REF="15">were notorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that of implicating the character of the writer, Morris &s;till loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Wa&s;hington is &s;till in corre&s;pondence with him.&mdash;Mr. Wa&s;h|ington ought, therefore, to expect, e&s;pecially &s;ince his conduct in the affair of Jay's treaty, that France mu&s;t con&s;ider Morris and Wa&s;hington as men of the &s;ame de&s;cription&punc; The chief difference, however, between the two is (for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough to profe&s;s an indifference about moral principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.</P>
<P>About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to Grenville, on the &s;ubject of the capture of Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Every thing was of a piece&mdash;every thing was mean. The &s;ame kind of character went to all circum&s;tances public or private. Di&s;gu&s;ted at this na|tional degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr. Wa&s;hington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Wa&s;hington) on the twenty-&s;econd of February, 1795, under cover to the then &s;ecretary of &s;tate (Mr. Randolph) and entru&s;ted the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French con&s;ul to Philadel|phia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Letombe had failed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was then in his hou&s;e, I &s;howed it to him. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that I would recall it, which he &s;uppo&s;ed might be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe had not then failed. I agreed to do &s;o, and it was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe. The letter will, however, now reach Mr. Wa&s;hington publicly in the cour&s;e of this Work.</P>
<P>About the month of September following, I had a &s;evere relap&s;e, which gave occa&s;ion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a con&s;iderable time before, which occa|&s;ioned me to ha&s;ten the work I had then on hand, <HI>The Second Part of the Age of Rea&s;on.</HI> When I had fini&s;hed the work, I be&s;towed another letter on Mr. Wa&s;hington, which I &s;ent under cover to Mr. Franklin Bache, of Philadelphia. The let|ter was as follows:</P>

<P>I HAD written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French con|&s;ul but, at the reque&s;t of Mr. Monroe, I withdrew it, and
<PB N="15" REF="16">the letter is &s;till by me. I was the more ea&s;ily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my intention to have returned to America the latter end of the pre&s;ent year (1795); but the illne&s;s I now &s;uffer prevents me. In ca&s;e I had come, I &s;hould have applied to you for &s;uch parts of your official letters (and your private ones, if you had cho&s;en to give them) as contained any in&s;tructions or directions either to Mr. Monroe, or to Mr. Morris, or to any other per&s;on, re&s;|pecting me; for after you were informed to my impri&s;onment in France, it was incumbent on you to have made &s;ome en|quiry into the cau&s;e, as you might very well conclude that I had not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot under&s;tand your &s;ilence upon this &s;ubject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my impri&s;onment; and this is the manner it is under&s;tood here, and will be under&s;tood in America, unle&s;s you will give me authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter, to propo&s;e to you to &s;end me copies of any letters you have written, that I may remove this &s;u&s;picion. In the preface to the Second Part of the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> I have given a memorandum from the hand-writing of Robe&s;pierre, in which he propo&s;ed a decree of accu&s;ation again&s;t me, <HI>"for the intere&s;t of America as well as of France."</HI> He could have no cau&s;e for putting America in the ca&s;e, but by interpreting the &s;ilence of the American government into connivance and con&s;ent. I was impri&s;oned on the ground of being born in England; and your &s;ilence in not enquiring the cau&s;e of that impri&s;onment, and reclaiming me again&s;t it, was tacitly giving me up. I ought not to have &s;u&s;pected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illne&s;s I now &s;uffer, or not, I &s;hall continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cau&s;e to think otherwi&s;e. I am &s;ure you would have found your&s;elf more at your ea&s;e, had you acted by me is you ought; for whether your de&s;ertion of me was intended to gratify the Engli&s;h government, or to let me fall into de|&s;truction in France, that you might exclaim the louder again&s;t the French revolution; or whether you hoped by my extinc|tion to meet with le&s;s oppo&s;ition in mounting up the Ameri|can government; either of the&s;e will involve you in reproach you will not ea&s;ily &s;hake off.</P>

<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>Feb. 22, 1795</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>As it is always painful to reproach tho&s;e one would wi&s;h to re&s;pect, it is not without &s;ome difficulty that I have taken the re&s;olution to write to you. The danger to which I have been expo&s;ed cannot have been unknown to you, and the guarded &s;ilence you have ob&s;erved upon that circum&s;tance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a friend or as pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>You knew enough of my character to be a&s;&s;ured, that I could not have de&s;erved impri&s;onment in France; and, with|out knowing any thing more than this, you had &s;ufficient ground to have taken &s;ome intere&s;t for my &s;afety. Every motive ari&s;ing from recollection ought to have &s;ugge&s;ted to you the con&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. But I cannot find that you have &s;o much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I was in pri&s;on or in liberty, dead or alive; what the cau&s;e of that impri&s;onment was, or whether there was any &s;ervice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance you could render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America, after the part I have acted towards her? or will it redound to her honour or to your's that I tell the &s;tory? I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay that you have not &s;erved America with more fidelity, or greater zeal, or more di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, than my&s;elf, and perhaps not with better effect. After the revolution of America had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, you re&s;ted at home to partake its advantages, and I ventured into new &s;cenes of difficulty to extend the princi|ples which that revolution had produced. In the progre&s;s of events, you beheld your&s;elf a pre&s;ident in America, and me a pri&s;oner in France; you folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became filent.</P>
<P>As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of America, I ought to be the more &s;urpri&s;ed at this connuct on the part of her govern|ment. It leaves me but one mode of explanation, which is, <HI>that every thing is not as it ought to be among&s;t you,</HI> and that the pre&s;ence of a man who might di&s;approve, and who had credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not wi&s;hed for. This was the operating motive with the de&s;potic faction that impri&s;oned me in France (though the pretence was that I was a foreigner) and tho&s;e that have been &s;ilent and inactive towards me in America, appear to me to have acted from the &s;ame motive. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;co|ver any other.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">After the part I have taken in the revolution of America, it is natural that I feel intere&s;ted in whatever relates to her character and pro&s;perity. Though I am not on the &s;pot to &s;ee what is immediately acting there, I &s;ee &s;ome part of what &s;he is acting in Europe. For your own &s;ake, as well as for that of America, I was both &s;urpri&s;ed and concerned at the appointment of Governor Morris, to be mini&s;ter to France. His conduct has proved, that the opinion I had formed of that appointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jeffer&s;on at the time, and I was frank enough to &s;ay the &s;ame thing to Morris, that <HI>it was an unfortunate appointment.</HI> His prating in&s;ignificant pompo&s;ity rendered him at once offen&s;ive, &s;u&s;pected, and ridiculous; and his total neglect of all bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted the Americans, that they propo&s;ed drawing up a prote&s;t again&s;t him. He carried this neglect to &s;uch an extreme, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to inform him of it; and I a&s;ked him, one day, <HI>if he did not feel him&s;elf a&s;hamed to take the money of the country, and do nothing for it?</HI> but Morris is &s;o fond of profit and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, that he cares nothing about character. Had he not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have precipitated the two countries into a rupture; and in this ca&s;e, hated <HI>&s;y&s;tematically</HI> as America is, and ever will be, by the Briti&s;h Government, and at the &s;ame time &s;u&s;pected by France, the commerce of America would have fallen a prey to both.</P>
<P>If the incon&s;i&s;tent conduct of Morris expo&s;ed the intere&s;t of America to &s;ome hazard in France, the pu&s;illanimous con|duct of Mr. Jay in England has rendered the American go|vernment contemptible in Europe. Is it po&s;&s;ible that any man, who has contributed to the independence of America, and to free her from the tyranny and inju&s;tice of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, can read without &s;hame and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville? It is a &s;atire upon the declaration of indepen|dence, and an encouragement to the Briti&s;h government to treat America with contempt. At the time this mini&s;ter of petitions was acting this mi&s;erable part, he had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his bu&s;ine&s;s as he ought. The &s;ucce&s;s or failure of his mi&s;&s;ion depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might have put his humble petition in his pocket, and gone home. The ca&s;e happened to be otherwi&s;e, and he has &s;acrificed the honour, and perhaps the advantage of it, by turning petitioner. I take it for granted, that he was &s;ent over to demand indemnification for the captured property; and, in this ca&s;e, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his demand, he might have &s;aid, <Q>That, though the government
<PB N="18" REF="19">of England might &s;uppo&s;e it&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eiz|ing American property bound to France, yet that &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity could not preclude indemnification to the proprie|tors, who, acting under the authority of their own govern|ment, were not accuntable to any other.</Q> But Mr. Jay &s;ets out with an implied recognition of the right of the Briti&s;h government to &s;eize and condemn; for he enters his complaint again&s;t the <HI>irregularity</HI> of the &s;eizures, and the condemnation, as if they were reprehen&s;ible only by not being conformable to the terms of the proclamation under which they were &s;eized. In&s;tead of being the envoy of a government, he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial. I can hardly help thinking but that Grenvile wrote that note him&s;elf and Jay &s;igned it; for the &s;tyle of it is dome&s;tic, and not diplomatic. The term <HI>his Ma|je&s;ty,</HI> u&s;ed without any de&s;criptive epithet, always &s;ignifies the king whom the mini&s;ter repre&s;ents. If this &s;inking of the demand into a petition was a juggle between Grenville and Jay to cover the indemnification, I think it will end in another juggle, that of never paying the money; and be made u&s;e of afterwards to preclude the right of demanding it: for Mr. Jay has virtually di&s;owned the right by appealing to the <HI>magnani|mity of his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the capturers.</HI> He has made this magnanimous maje&s;ty the umpire in the ca&s;e, and the govern|ment of the United States mu&s;t abide by the deci&s;ion. If, Sir, I turn &s;ome part of this bu&s;ine&s;s into ridicule, it is to avoid the unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of &s;erious indignation.</P>
<P>Among other things which I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand, is your proclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as an a&s;&s;umption on the part of the executive. But pa&s;&s;ing this over as a di&s;putable ca&s;e, and con&s;idering it only as political, the con&s;equence has been that of &s;u&s;taining the lo&s;&s;es of war, without the balance of repri&s;als. When the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of neutrality, on the part of America, was an&s;wered by ho&s;tilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that neutrality exi&s;ted no longer; and to maintain it after this was not only to encourage farther in&s;ults and depredations, but was an informal breach of neutrality towards France, by pa&s;&s;ively contributing to the aid of her enemy. That the government of England con&s;idered the American government as pu&s;illanimous, is evident from the increa&s;ing in&s;olence of the conduct of the former towards the latter, till the affair of Ge|neral Wayne. She then &s;aw that it might be po&s;&s;ible to kick a government into &s;ome degree of &s;pirit. So far as the procla|mation of neutrality was intended to prevent a di&s;&s;olute &s;pirit of privateering in America under foreign colours, it was un|doubtedly laudable; but to continue it as a government neu|trality,
<PB N="19" REF="20">after the commerce of America was made war upon, was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and not neutrality.&mdash;I have heard &s;o much about this thing called neutrality, that I know not if the unge|nerous and di&s;honourable &s;ilence (for I mu&s;t call it &s;uch) that has been ob&s;erved by your part of the government towards me, during my impri&s;onment, has not in &s;ome mea&s;ure ari&s;en from that policy.</P>
<P>Though I have written you this letter, you ought not to &s;uppo&s;e it has been an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I a&s;&s;ure you, it has co&s;t me &s;ome di&s;quietude. I am &s;orry you have given me cau&s;e to do it; for, as I have al|ways remembered your former friend&s;hip with plea&s;ure, I &s;uffer a lo&s;s by your depriving me of that &s;entiment.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>That this letter was not written in very good temper, is very evident; but it was ju&s;t &s;uch a letter as his conduct ap|peared to me to merit, and every thing on his part &s;ince has &s;erved to confirm that opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his &s;ilence, with re&s;pect to my impri&s;onment in France, &s;ome of his faction have furni&s;hed me with it. What I here allude to, is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied af|terwards into a New-York paper, both under the patronage of the Wa&s;hington faction, in which the writer, &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing me in pri&s;on in France, wonders at my lengthy re&s;pite from the &s;caffold. And he marks his politics &s;till farther, by &s;aying, <Q>It appears, moreover, that the people of England did not reli&s;h his (Thomas Paine's) opinions quite &s;o well as he ex|pected; and that for one of his la&s;t pieces, as de&s;tructive to the peace and happine&s;s of their country (meaning, I &s;up|po&s;e, the <HI>Rights of Man</HI>) they threatened our knight-errant with &s;uch &s;erious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to Botany Bay, he fled over to France, as a le&s;s dangerous voyage.</Q></P>
<P>I am not refuting or contradicting the fal&s;ehood of this publication, for it is &s;ufficiently notorious; neither am I cen|&s;uring the writer: on the contrary, I thank him for the expla|nation he has incautiou&s;ly given of the principles of the Wa&s;h|ington faction. In&s;ignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capable of having &s;ome ill effects, had it arrived in France during my impri&s;onment, and in the time of Robe&s;pierre; and I am not uncharitable in &s;uppo&s;ing that this was one of the intentions of the writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know not who the writer of the piece is, but &s;ome late Americans &s;ay it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, and now a Briti&s;h con&s;ul; and that he writes under the &s;igna|ture of Peter Skunk, or Peter Porcupine, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;ig|nature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">I have now done with Mr. Wa&s;hington on the &s;core of private affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been &s;uch as not to have merited the&s;e re|proaches. Errors, or caprices of the temper, can be pardoned and forgotten; but a cold eliberate crime of the heart, men as Mr. Wa&s;hington is capable of acting, is not to be wa&s;hed away &mdash; I now proceed to other matter:</P>
<P>After Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character of every thing that was to follow might be ea&s;ily fore&s;een; and it was upon this anticipation that my letter of February the twenty-&s;econd was founded. The event has proved that I was not mi&s;taken, except that it has been much wor&s;e than I expected.</P>
<P>It would naturally occur to Mr. Wa&s;hington, that the &s;e|cre&s;y of Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, where there was already an American mini&s;ter, could not but create &s;ome &s;u&s;picion in the French government, e&s;pecially as the conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr. Wa&s;hington with Morris was known.</P>
<P>The character which Mr. Wa&s;hington has attempted to act in the world, is a &s;ort of non-de&s;eribable cameleon coloured thing, called Prudence. It is, in many ca&s;es, a &s;ub&s;titute for Principle, and is &s;o nearly allied to Hypocri&s;y, that it ea&s;ily &s;lides into it. His genius for prudence furni&s;hed him, in this in&s;tance, with an expedient that &s;erved (as is the natural and general character of all expedients) to dimini&s;h the embarra&s;&s;|ment of the moment, and multiply them afterwards; for he cau&s;ed it to be announced to the French government as a con|fidential matter (Mr. Wa&s;hington &s;hould recollect that I was a member of the Convention, and had the means of knowing what I here &s;tate) &mdash; he cau&s;ed it, I say, to be announced, and that for the purpo&s;e of preventing any unea&s;ine&s;s to France, on the &s;core of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, that the object of that mi&s;&s;ion, and Mr. Jay's authority, were re&s;tricted to the demanding of the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and in|demrification for the cargoes captured in American ve&s;&s;els. &mdash; Mr. Wa&s;hington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good rea&s;on, to him&s;elf, for refu&s;ing to furni&s;h the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives with copies of the in&s;tructions given to Jay, as he might &s;u&s;pect, among other things, that he &s;hould al&s;o be called upon for copies of in&s;tructions given to other mini&s;ters, and that in the contradiction of in&s;tructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Wa&s;hington may now perhaps learn, when it is too late to be of any u&s;e to him, that a man will pa&s;s better through the world with a thou&s;and open errors upon his back, than in being detected
<PB N="21" REF="22">in <HI>one</HI> &s;ly fal&s;ehood. When one is detected, a thou&s;and are &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being ne|gotiated by Mr. Jay (for nobody &s;u&s;pected any) came in an Engli&s;h new&s;paper, which announced that a treaty, <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> had been concluded between the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by every American in Paris, as an impo&s;&s;ible thing; and though it was di&s;believed by the French, it imprinted a &s;u&s;picion that &s;ome underhand bu&s;ine&s;s was going forward. At length the treaty it&s;elf arrived, and every well-affected American blu&s;hed with &s;hame.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve how the appearances of characters will change, whil&s;t the root that produces them remains the &s;ame. The Wa&s;hington faction having waded through the &s;lough of negociation, and, whil&s;t it amu&s;ed France with pro|fe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip contrived to in ure her, immediately throws off the hypocrite and a&s;&s;umes the &s;waggering air of a bravado. The party papers of that imbecile admini&s;tration were on this occa&s;ion filled with paragraphs about &s;ove|reignty. A poltroon may boa&s;t of his &s;overeign right to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of &s;overeignty &s;hown in the treaty with England. But tho&s;e da&s;hing para|graphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for France, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in men, money, and &s;hips, Mr. Wa&s;hington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of his military talents I &s;hall &s;peak here|after.</P>
<P>I mean not to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of any article of Jay's treaty; I &s;hall &s;peak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be ju&s;tified on the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-exi&s;ting with France. But the &s;overeign right of explanation does not lie with George Wa&s;hington and his man Timothy; France, on her part, has, at lea&s;t, an equal right: and when nations di&s;pute, it is not &s;o much about words as about things.</P>
<P>A man, &s;uch as the world calls a &s;harper, as ver&s;ed as Jay mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into engagements, and make bargains, in &s;uch a mahner as to cheat &s;ome other party, without that party being able, as the phra&s;e is, <HI>to take th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law of him.</HI> This often happens in the cabali&s;tical circle of what is called law. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national &s;cale of treaties, it is too de&s;picable to be defended, or to be permitted to exi&s;t. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is
<PB N="22" REF="23">founded, &s;o far as it has relation to the treaty pre-exi&s;ting with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and per|verts all the great articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England, with whom France is at war. The Wa&s;hington admini&s;tra|tion &s;hows great de&s;ire that the treaty between France and the United States be pre&s;erved. Nobody can doubt its &s;incerity upon this matter. There is not a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, a Briti&s;h merchant, or a Briti&s;h agent or factor, in America, that does not anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h the &s;ame thing. The treaty with France &s;erves now as a pa&s;&s;port to &s;upply England with naval &s;tores, and other articles of American produce; whil&s;t the &s;ame articles when coming to France are made contraband, or &s;eiz|able, by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty with France &s;ays, that neutral &s;hips make neutral property, and thereby gives protection to Engli&s;h property on board American &s;hips; and Jay's treaty delivers up French property on board Ame|rican &s;hips to be &s;eized by the Engli&s;h. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour, and of the pre&s;ervation of treaties, whil&s;t &s;uch a bare-faced treachery as this &s;tares the world in the face.</P>
<P>The Wa&s;hington admini&s;tration may &s;ave it&s;elf the trouble of proving to the French government its <HI>mo&s;t faithful</HI> inten|tions of pre&s;erving the treaty with France; for France has now no de&s;ire that it &s;hould be pre&s;erved; &s;he had nominated an envoy extraordinary to America, to make Mr. Wa&s;hington <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd his government a pre&s;ent of the treaty, and to have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore to do with <HI>that</HI> or with <HI>him.</HI> It was at the &s;ame time officially declared to the American mini&s;ter at Paris, <HI>that the French republic had rather have the American government for an open enemy than a treacherous friend.</HI> This, &s;ir, together with the internal di&s;tractions cau&s;ed in America, and the lo&s;s of character in the world, is the <HI>eventful cri&s;is</HI> alluded to in the beginning of this Letter, to which your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow France would have conducted her&s;elf towards Ame|rica, and American commerce, after all treaty &s;tipulations had cea&s;ed, and under the &s;en&s;e of &s;ervices rendered, and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an unplea&s;ant reflec|tion, that in all national quarrels, the innocent, and even the friendly part of the community, become involved with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America continued to manife&s;t an invariable attachment, in the general ma&s;s of the people, to their original ally, in oppo&s;ition to the new-fangled Wa&s;hington faction, the re&s;o|lutions
<PB N="23" REF="24">that had been taken in France were &s;u&s;pended. It happened al&s;o, fortunately enough, that Governor Morris was not mini&s;ter at this time.</P>
<P>There is, however, one point that yet remains in embryo, and which, among other things, &s;erves to &s;how the ignorance of the Wa&s;hington treaty makers, and their inattention to pre-exi&s;ting treaties, when they were employing them&s;elves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with England.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and France &s;ays, <Q>The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King and the United States engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in re&s;pect to commerce and navigation, that &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favour freely, if the conce&s;&s;ion was freely made, or on allowing the &s;ame compen&s;ation if the conce&s;&s;ion was conditional.</Q></P>
<P>All the conce&s;&s;ions therefore made to England by Jay's treaty are, through the medium of this &s;econd article in the pre-exi&s;ting treaty, made to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be exerci&s;ed by her as a mat|ter of right, the &s;ame as by England.</P>
<P>Jay's treaty makes a conce&s;&s;ion to England, and that un|conditionally, of &s;eizing naval &s;tores in American &s;hips, and condemning them as contraband. It makes al&s;o a conce&s;&s;ion to England to &s;eize provi&s;ions and <HI>other articles</HI> in American &s;hips. <HI>Other articles,</HI> are <HI>all other articles;</HI> and none but an ignoramus, or &s;omething wor&s;e, would have put &s;uch a phra&s;e into a treaty. The condition annexed to this ca&s;e is, that the provi&s;ions and other articles &s;o &s;eized, are to be paid for at a price to be agreed upon. Mr. Wa&s;hington, as pre&s;ident ra|tified this treaty after he knew the Briti&s;h government had recommenced an indi&s;criminate &s;eizure of provi&s;ions, and of all other articles in American &s;hips: and it is now known that tho&s;e &s;eizures were made to fit out the expedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known beforehand that they would be made. The evidence goes al&s;o a good way to prove that Jay and Grenville under&s;tood each other upon that &s;ubject. Mr. Pinkney, when he pa&s;&s;ed through France in his way to Spain, &s;poke of the recommencement of the &s;eizures as a thing that would take place. The French government had by &s;ome means received information from London to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, with the addition, that the recommencement of the &s;eizures would cau&s;e no mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Briti&s;h and American governments. Grenville, in defending him&s;elf again&s;t the oppo&s;ition in parliament, on account of the &s;carcity of corn, &s;aid (&s;ee his &s;peech at the opening of the
<PB N="24" REF="25">parliament that met October 29, 1795) that <HI>the &s;upplies for the Quiberon expedition were furni&s;hed out of the American &s;hips,</HI> and all the accounts received at that time from England &s;tated that tho&s;e &s;eizures were made under the treaty. After the &s;upplies for the Quiberon expedition had been procured, and the expected &s;ucce&s;s had failed, the &s;eizures were counter|manded; and had the French &s;eized provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els going to England, it is probable that the Quiberon expedition could not have been attempted.</P>
<P>In one point of view, the treaty with England operates as a loan to the Engli&s;h government. It gives permi&s;&s;ion to that government to take American property at &s;ea, to any amount, and pay for it when it &s;uits her; and, be&s;ides this, the treaty is in every point of view a &s;urrender of the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refu&s;al to France of the rights of neutrality. The American flag is not now a neutral flag to France; Jay's treaty of &s;urrender give a monopoly of it to England.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the treaty of commerce between America and France was formed on the mo&s;t liberal principles, and cal|culated to give the greate&s;t encouragement to the infant com|merce of America. France was neither a carrier nor an ex|porter of naval &s;tores, or of provi&s;ions; tho&s;e articles belonged wholly to America; and they had all the protection in that treaty which a treaty can give. But &s;o much has that treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it on the part of France has &s;erved to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with England; for he mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed the hands of France tied up by her treaty with America, when he was making &s;uch large conce&s;&s;ions in favour of England. The injury which Mr. Wa&s;hington's admini&s;tration has done to the character, as well as to the commerce of America, is too great to be re|paired by him. Foreign nations will be &s;hy of making treaties with a government that has given the faithle&s;s exam|ple of perverting the liberality of a former treaty to the in|jury of the party with whom it was made.</P>
<P>In what a fraudulent light mu&s;t Mr. Wa&s;hington's character appear in the world, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here follows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety, whil&s;t Jay was negociating in profound &s;ecre&s;y this treacherous treaty:</P>

<P>Was it by entering into a treaty with England to &s;urrender French property on board American &s;hips, to be &s;eized by the Engli&s;h, whil&s;t Engli&s;h property on board American &s;hips was declared by the French treaty not to be &s;eizable, <HI>that the bonds of friend&s;hip between America, and France were to be drawn clo&s;er?</HI> Was it by declaring naval &s;tores contraband when coming to France, whil&s;t by the French treaty they were not contraband when going to England, that the <HI>connection between France and America was to be advanced?</HI> Was it by opening the American ports to the Briti&s;h navy in the pre&s;ent war, from which ports that &s;ame navy had been expelled by the aid &s;olicited from France in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">merican war (and that aid gra|tuitou&s;ly given), that the gratitude of America was to be &s;hewn, and the &s;olicitude &s;poken of in the letter demon&s;trated?</P>
<P>As the letter was addre&s;&s;ed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr. Wa&s;hington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be &s;een by any other eye than that of Robe&s;|pierre, or be heard by any other ear than that of the Com|mittee; that it would pa&s;s as a whi&s;per acro&s;s the Atlant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Com+mittee all &s;u&s;picion upon Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to England, and in this point of view it was &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of the moment then pa&s;&s;ing; but as the event of that mi&s;&s;ion has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it &s;erves no other pur|po&s;e of the pre&s;ent moment than to &s;hew that the writer is not to be credited. Two circum&s;tances &s;erved to make the reading of the letter nece&s;&s;ary in the Convention; the one was, that they who &s;ucceeded on the fall of Robe&s;pierre, found it mo&s;t proper to act with publicity; the other, to extingui&s;h the &s;u&s;picions which the &s;trange conduct of Morris had occa|&s;ioned in France.</P>
<P>When the Briti&s;h treaty and the ratification of it by Mr. Wa&s;hington were known in France, all further declarations from him of his good di&s;po&s;ition, as an ally and a friend, pa&s;&s;ed for &s;o many cyphers; but &s;till it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is &s;tipulated in the Briti&s;h treaty, that commi&s;&s;ioners are to report, at the end of two years, on the ca&s;e of <HI>neutral &s;hips making neutral property.</HI> In the mean time neutral &s;hips do <HI>not</HI> make neutral property according to the Briti&s;h treaty, and they <HI>do</HI> according to the French treaty. The pre&s;ervation therefore of the French treaty became of great importance to England, as by that means &s;he can employ American &s;hips as carriers, whil&s;t the &s;ame advantage is denied to France. Whether the French treaty could exi&s;t as a matter of right after this clande&s;tine perver&s;ion of it, could not but give &s;ome apprehen&s;ions to the partizans of the Briti&s;h treaty, and it became nece&s;&s;ary to them to make up by fine words what was wanting in good actions.</P>
<P>An opportunity offered to that purpo&s;e. The Convention, on the public reception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the Ameri|can flag and the French flag to be di&s;played unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made a pre&s;ent of an American flag for the purpo&s;e. The Convention returned this compliment, by &s;ending a French flag to America, to be pre&s;ented by their mini&s;ter, Mr. Adet, to the American go|vernment. This re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed long before Jay's treaty was known or &s;u&s;pected: it pa&s;&s;ed in the days of confidence;&mdash;but the flag was not pre&s;ented by Mr Adet till &s;everal months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Wa&s;hington made this the occa&s;ion of &s;aying &s;ome fine things to the French mini&s;ter; and the better to get him&s;elf into tune to do this, he began by &s;aying the fine&s;t things of him&s;elf.</P>

<P>It is laughable to hear Mr. Wa&s;hington talk of his <HI>&s;ympa|thetic feelings,</HI> who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no proof of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he &s;o liberally pays to him&s;elf on the &s;core of the American revola|tion, the propriety of them may be que&s;tioned; and, &s;ince he has forced them &s;o much into notice, it is fair to examine his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger might be led to &s;uppo&s;e, from the egoti&s;m with which Mr. Wa&s;hington &s;peaks, that him&s;elf, and him&s;elf only, had generated, condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted, completed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, the revolution. In fine, that it was all his own doing.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as to the political part, he had no &s;hare in it; and therefore the whole of <HI>that</HI> is out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to him. There remains, then, only the military part; and it would have been prudent in Mr. Wa&s;hington not to have awakened inquiry upon that &s;ubject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was di&s;po&s;ed to take away the laurels that, whether they were <HI>acquired</HI> or not, had been given.</P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington's merit con&s;i&s;ted in con&s;tancy. But con|&s;tancy was the common virtue of the revolution. Who was there that was incon&s;tant? I know but of one military defec|tion, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection, among tho&s;e who made them&s;elves eminent when the revolu|tion was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.</P>
<P>But when we &s;peak of military character, &s;omething more is to be under&s;tood than con&s;tancy; and &s;omething more <HI>ought</HI> to be under&s;tood than the Fabian &s;y&s;tem of <HI>doing nothing.</HI> The <HI>nothing</HI> part can be done by any body, Old Mrs. Thomp&s;on, the hou&s;ekeeper of head-quarters (who threatened to make the &s;un and the <HI>wind</HI> &s;hine through Rivington of New-York) could have been as good as Barak.</P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington had the nominal rank of commander in chief, but he was not &s;o in fact. He had, in reality, only a
<PB N="28" REF="29">&s;eparate command. He had no control over, or direction of, the army to the northward under Gates, that captured Bur|goyne; or of that to the &s;outh under Greene, that recovered the &s;outhern &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Winterbotham's valuable Hi&s;tory of America, lately publi&s;hed.</NOTE>.&mdash;The nominal rank, however, of com|mander in chief, &s;erved to throw upon him the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e actions, and to make him appear as the &s;oul and centre of all military operations in America.</P>
<P>He commenced his command June 1775, during the time the Ma&s;&s;acau&s;et army lay before Bo&s;ton, and after the affair o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bunker's Hill. The commencement of his command was the commencement of inactivity. Nothing was afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months he remained before Bo&s;ton. If we may judge from the re&s;i&s;tance made at Concord, and afterwards at Bunker's Hill, there was a &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e at that time, which the pre&s;ence of Mr. Wa&s;h|ington chilled into cold defence. By the advantage of a good exterior he attracts re&s;pect, which his habitual &s;ilence tends to pre&s;erve; but he has not the talent of in&s;piring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Bo&s;ton to Halifax in March 1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more advantageous po&s;ition at New-York.</P>
<P>The inactivity of the campaign of 1775, on the part of General Wa&s;hington, when the enemy had a le&s;s force than in any other future period of the war, and the injudicious choice of po&s;itions taken by him in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greate&s;t force, nece&s;&s;arily produced the lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes that marked that gloomy campaign. The po&s;itions taken were either i&s;lands, or necks of land. In the former, the enemy, by the aid of their &s;hips, could bring their whole force again&s;t a part of General Wa&s;hing|ton's, as in the affair of Long I&s;land; and in the latter, he might be &s;hut up as in the bottom of a bag. This had nearly been the ca&s;e at New-York, and it was &s;o in part: it was actually the ca&s;e at Fort Wa&s;hington; and it would have been the ca&s;e at Fort Lee, if General Greene had not moved preci|pitately off, leaving every thing behind, and, by gaining Hackin&s;uch-bridge, got out of the bag of Bergin-neck.&mdash;How far Mr. Wa&s;hington, as general, is blamable for tho&s;e matters, I am not undertaking to determine; but they are evidently defects in military geography. The &s;ucce&s;sful &s;kir|mi&s;hes at the clo&s;e of that campaign (matters that would &s;carcely be noticed in a better &s;tate of things) make the bril|liant exploits of General Wa&s;hington's &s;even campaigns.&mdash;
<PB N="29" REF="30">No wonder we &s;ee &s;o much pu&s;illanimity in the <HI>pre&s;ident,</HI> when we &s;ee &s;o little enterpri&s;e in the <HI>general!</HI></P>
<P>The campaign of 1777 be ame famous, not by any thing on the part of General Wa&s;hington, but by the capture of General Burgoyne and the army under his command, by the northern army at Saratoga, under General Gates. So totally di&s;tinct and unconnected were the two armies of Wa&s;hington and Gates, and &s;o independent was the latter of the authority of the nominal commander in chief, that the two generals did not &s;o much as corre&s;pond, and it was only by a letter of General (&s;ince Governor) Clinton, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> General Wa&s;hington was informed of that event. The B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia this year, which they eva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ated the next, ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave their heavy baggage and &s;leet of tran&s;|ports from capture by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ench admiral D'E&s;taign, who arrived at the mouth of the Delaware &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The capture of Burgoyne gave an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lat in Europe to the American arms, and facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was not kept up by any thing on the part of General Wa&s;hington. The &s;ame unfortunate languor that marked his entrance into the fiel, continued always. Di&s;|content began to prevail &s;trongly again&s;t him, and a party was formed in Congre&s;s, whil&s;t &s;itting at York Town in Pen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lvania, for removing him from the command of the army. The hope however of better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the unwillingne&s;s of &s;howing di&s;content, di&s;&s;ipated the matter.</P>
<P>Nothing was done in the campaign of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wa&s;hington commanded, except the taking Stony-Point by general Wayne. The &s;outhern &s;tates in the mean time were overrun by the enemy. They were afterwards recovered by general Greene, who had in a very great mea&s;ure created the army that accompli&s;hed that recovery. In all this general Wa&s;hington had no &s;hare. The Fabian &s;y&s;tem of war, followed by him, began now to un|told it&s;elf with all its evils; for what is Fabian war without Fabian means to &s;upport it? The finances of Congre&s;s, de|pending wholly on emi&s;&s;ions of paper-money, were exhau&s;ted. Its credit was gone. The continental trea&s;ury was not able to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons to tran&s;port the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores to the army, and yet the &s;ole object, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the revolution, was a thing of remote di&s;tance. The time I am now &s;peaking of is in the latter end of the year 1780.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things it was found not only ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i|ent, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for Congre&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the whole
<PB N="30" REF="31">ca&s;e to its ally. I know more of this matter (before it came into Congre&s;s, or was known to general Wa&s;hington), of its progre&s;s, and its i&s;&s;ue, than I choo&s;e to &s;tate in this letter. Colonel John Laurens was &s;ent to France, as an envoy ex|traordinary on this occa&s;ion, and by a private agreement between him and me, I accompanied him. We &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton in the Alliance frigate, February eleventh, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congre&s;s; &s;he was now called upon to do more. The event of colonel Laurens's mi&s;&s;ion, with the aid of the venerable mini&s;ter Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a pre&s;ent, &s;ix millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to &s;end a fleet of not le&s;s than thirty &s;ail of the line, at her own expen&s;e, as an aid to America. Co|lonel Laurens and my&s;elf returned from Bre&s;t the fir&s;t of June following, taking with us two millions and a half of livres (upwards of one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling) of the money given, and convoying two &s;hips with &s;tores.</P>
<P>We arrived at Bo&s;ton the twenty-fifth of Augu&s;t follow|ing. De Gra&s;&s;e arrived with the French fleet in the Che&s;a|peak at the &s;ame time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras, making thirty-one &s;ail of the line. The money was tran&s;ported in waggons from Bo&s;ton to the bank of Phila|delphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has &s;ince put him&s;elf at the head of the li&s;t of petitioners in favour of the Briti&s;h treaty, was then pre&s;ident. And it was by the aid of this money, of this fleet, and of Rochambeau's army, that Cornwailis was taken; the laurels of which has been unju&s;tly given to Mr. Wa&s;hington. His merit in that affair was no more than that of any other American officer.</P>
<P>I have had, and &s;till have, as much pride in the American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Wa&s;hington has a right to have; but that pride has never made me forgetful whence the great aid came that completed the bu&s;ine&s;s. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the commencement of the revolution. It is one of the &s;ubjects treated of in the pamph|let <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> but as a matter that could not be hoped for, unle&s;s independence was declared. The aid however was greater than could have been expected.</P>
<P>It is as well the ingratitude as the pu&s;illanimity of Mr. Wa&s;hington, and the Wa&s;hington faction, that has brought upon America the lo&s;s of character &s;he now &s;uffers in the world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it is &s;till expo&s;ed. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;oon found out what &s;ort of men they had to deal with, and they dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was
<PB N="31" REF="32">wanting, it has been fully given &s;ince, in the &s;nivelling ad|dre&s;s of the New York chamber of commerce to the pre&s;i|dent, and in that of &s;undry merchants of Philadelphia, which was not much better.</P>
<P>When the revolution of America was finally e&s;tabli&s;hed by the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and &s;he had nothing to do but to &s;tand firm upon that ground. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked a rupture with her, had &s;he &s;hown a proper re&s;olution to defend her rights: but encouraged as they were, by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive character of the American admi|ni&s;tration, they proceeded from in&s;ult to in&s;ult, till none more were left to be offered. The propo&s;als made by Sweden and Denmark to the American government were di&s;regarded. I know not if &s;o much as an an&s;wer has been returned to them. The mini&s;ter <HI>penitentiary,</HI> (as &s;ome of the Briti&s;h prints called him) Mr. Jay, was &s;ent on a pilgrimage to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the mean time, the lengthy and drow&s;y writer of the pieces &s;igned <HI>Camillus</HI> held him&s;elf in re&s;erve to vindicate <HI>every thing;</HI> and to found in America the toc&s;in of terror upon the <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> re&s;ources of England. Her re&s;ources, &s;ays he, are greater than tho&s;e of all the other powers. This man is &s;o intoxicated with fear and finance, that he knows not the difference between <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus</HI>&mdash; between a hundred pounds in hand, and a hundred pounds wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>The commerce of America, &s;o far as it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, by all the treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed were good. That ground ought never to have been departed from. It was the ju&s;tifiable ground of right; and no tem|porary difficulties ought to have induced an abandonment of it. The ca&s;e is now otherwi&s;e. The ground, the &s;cene, the preten&s;ions, the every thing is changed. The commerce of America is by Jay's treaty put under foreign dominion. The &s;ea is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is reduced to the right of e&s;caping; that is, until &s;ome &s;hip of England or France &s;tops her ve&s;&s;els, and carries them into port. Every ar|ticle of American produce, whether from the &s;ea or the land, fi&s;h, fle&s;h, vegetable, or manufacture, is by Jay's treaty made either contraband, or &s;eizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the article which enumerates the contra|band articles, &s;uch as fire-arms, gunpowder, &amp;c. is followed by another which enumerates the articles not contraband; but it is not &s;o in Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is &s;upplied by the article for &s;eizing and carrying into port; and
<PB N="32" REF="33">the &s;weeping phra&s;e of provi&s;ions and <HI>other articles</HI> includes every thing. There never was &s;uch a ba&s;e and &s;ervile treaty of &s;urrender, &s;ince treaties began to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the ground upon which America now &s;tands. All her rights of commerce and navigation are to be begin anew, and that with lo&s;s of character to begin with.&mdash;If there is &s;en&s;e enough left in the heart, to call a blu&s;h into the cheek, the Wa&s;hington admini&s;tration mu&s;t be a&s;hamed to appear.&mdash;And as to you, &s;ir, treacherous in private friend&s;hip (for &s;o you have been to me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in public life, to world will be puzzled to decide, whether you are an APOSTATE, or an IMPOSTOR?

<HEAD>MEMORIAL OF THOMAS PAINE TO MR. MONROE, <HI>Alluded to in the foregoing Letter.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Luxembourg, <DATE>September: 10, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ADDRESS this memorial to you, in con&s;equence of a letter I received from a friend 18th Fructidor, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pt. 14th) in which he &s;ays;&mdash; <Q>Mr. Monroe has told me, that he has no orders (meaning from the Congre&s;s) repecting you; but I am &s;ure he will leave nothing undone to liberate you. But, from what I learn from all the late Americans, you are not con|&s;idered either by the government, or by the individuals as an American citizen. You have been made a French citi|zen, which you have accepted, and you have further made your&s;elf a &s;ervant of the French republic; and therefore it would be out of character for an American mini&s;ter to in|terfere in their internal concerns.&mdash;You mu&s;t therefore
<PB N="33" REF="34">either be liberated out of compliance to America, or &s;tand your trial, which you have a right to demand.</Q></P>
<P>This information was &s;o unexpected by me, that I am at a lo&s;s how to an&s;wer it. I know not on what principle it ori|ginates;&mdash;whether from an idea, that I had voluntarily aban|doned my citizen&s;hip of America, for that of France, or from any article of the American con&s;titution applied to me.&mdash;The fir&s;t is untrue with re&s;pect to any intention on my part; and the &s;econd is without foundation, as I &s;hall &s;how in the cour&s;e of this memorial.</P>
<P>The idea of conferring honour of citizen&s;hip upon fo|reigners, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in propagating the principles of liberty and humanity, in oppo&s;ition to de&s;poti&s;m, war, and blood&s;hed, was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by me to La Fayette, at the commencement of the French revolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with tho&s;e principles. My mo|tive in making this propo&s;al was to render the people of dif|ferent nations more fraternal than they had been, or then were. I ob&s;erved that almo&s;t every branch of &s;cience had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&s;elf of the exerci&s;e of this right, &s;o far as it regarded its in|&s;titution. Mo&s;t of the academies and &s;ocieties in Europe, and al&s;o the&s;e of America, conferred the rank of honorary mem|ber, upon foreigners eminent in knowledge, and made them, in fact, citizens of their literary or &s;cientific republic; with|out affecting or anywi&s;e dimini&s;hing, their rights of citizen|&s;hip in their own country, or in other &s;ocieties: and why the &s;cience of government &s;hould not have the &s;ame advantage, or why the people in one nation, &s;hould not by their repre&s;en|tatives, exerci&s;e the right of conferring the honour of citizen|&s;hip, upon individuals eminent in another nation; without a affecting <HI>their</HI> rights of citizen&s;hip, is a problem yet to be &s;olved.</P>
<P>I now proceed to remark on that part of the letter, in which the writer &s;ays&mdash;that, <Q><HI>from all he can learn from the late Ame|ricans, I am not con&s;idered in America, either by the government or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I wi&s;h to a&s;k, what is here meant by the government of America? The members who compo&s;e the government, are only individuals when in conver&s;ation, and who mo&s;t probably, hold very different opinions upon the &s;ub|ject.&mdash;Have Congre&s;s as a body made any declaration re&s;pect|ing me, that they now no longer con&s;ider me as a citizen? If they have not, any thing they otherwi&s;e &s;ay, is no more than the opinion of individuals, and con&s;equently is not legal authority, or anywi&s;e &s;ufficient authority to deprive any man of his citizen&s;hip. Be&s;ides, whether a man has forfeited his
<PB N="34" REF="35">rights of citizen&s;hip, is a que&s;tion not determinable by Con|gre&s;s, but by a court of judicature, and a jury; and mu&s;t de|pend upon evidence, and the application of &s;ome law or ar|ticle or the con&s;titution to the ca&s;e. No &s;uch proceeding has yet been had, and con&s;equently I remain a citizen until it be had, be that deci&s;ion what it may; for there can be no &s;uch thing as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of rights in the interim.</P>
<P>I am very well aware, and always was, of the article of the con&s;titution which &s;ays, as nearly as I can recollect the word, that <Q>any citizen of the United &s;tates, who &s;hall accept any title, place, or office, from any foreign king, prince, or &s;tate, &s;hall forfeit and lo&s;e, his right or citizen&s;hip of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>Had the article &s;aid, that <HI>any citizen of the United &s;tates, who &s;had be member of any foreign convention, for the purpo&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a free con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ation, &s;hall forfeit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the United States,</HI> the article had been directly applicable to me; but the idea of &s;uch an article never could have entered the mind of the American Convention, and the pre&s;ent article is altogether foreign to the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to me. It &s;uppo&s;es a government in active exi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, and not a government di&s;|&s;olved; and it &s;uppo&s;es a citizen of America, accepting titles and offices under that government, and not a citizen of Ame|rica who gives his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a convention cho&s;en by the people, for the purpo&s;e of forming a government <HI>de now,</HI> founded on their authority.</P>
<P>The late con&s;titution and government of France was di&s;|&s;olved the tenth of Augu&s;t 1792. The national legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly then in being, &s;uppo&s;ed it&s;elf without &s;ufficient au|thority to continue its &s;ittings, and it propo&s;ed to the depart|ments to elect, not another legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, but a conven|tion for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of forming a new con&s;titution. When the a&s;&s;embly were di&s;cour&s;ing on this matter, &s;ome of the members &s;aid, that they wi&s;hed to gain all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance po&s;&s;ible upon the &s;ubject of free con&s;titutions; and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to elect and invite foreigner, of any nation to the con|vention, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in-defending, ex|plaining, and propagating, the principles of liberty. It was on this occa&s;ion that my name was mentioned in the a&s;&s;embly. After this, a deputation from a body of the French people, in order to remove any objection that might be made again&s;t my a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the propo&s;ed convention, reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;embly, as their repre&s;entatives, to give me the title of French Citizen; after which, I was elected a member of the French Conven|tion, in four different departments, as is already known.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e therefore is, that I accepted nothing from any
<PB N="35" REF="36">king, prince, or &s;tate; or from any government: for France was without any government, except what aro&s;e from com|mon con&s;ent, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. Neither did <HI>"I make my&s;elf a &s;ervant of the French Republic,"</HI> as the letter alluded to expre&s;&s;es; for at that time France was no republic, not even in name. She was altogether a people in a &s;tate of revolution.</P>
<P>It was not until the Convention met that France was de|clared a republic, and monarchy aboli&s;hed; &s;oon after which a committee was elected, of which I was a member, to form a con&s;titution, which was pre&s;ented to the Convention, the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth of February following, but was not to be taken into con&s;ideration till after the expiration of two months, and if approved by the Convention, was then to be referred to the people for their acceptance, with &s;uch additions or amendments as the convention &s;hould make.</P>
<P>In thus employing my&s;elf upon the formation of a con&s;ti|tution, I certainly did nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the Ameri|can con&s;titution. I took no oath of allegiance to France, or any other oath whatever. I con&s;idered the citizen&s;hip they had pre&s;ented me, as an honorary mark of re&s;pect paid to me not only as a friend to liberty, but as an American citizen. My acceptance of that, or the deputy&s;hip, not conferred on me by any king, prince, or &s;tate, but by a people in &s;tate of revolution, and contending for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my citizen&s;hip, from America to France. There I was a real citizen, paying taxes; here I was a volun|tary friend, employing my&s;elf on a temporary &s;ervice. Every American in Paris knew, that it was my con&s;tant intention to return to America, as &s;oon as a con&s;titution &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and that I anxiou&s;ly waited for that event.</P>
<P>I ever mu&s;t deny, that the article of the American con&s;ti|tution already mentioned, can be applied either verbally, in|tentionally, or con&s;tructively, to me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the Convention that framed it, to pre&s;erve the parity of the American republic, from being deba&s;ed by fo|reign and foppi&s;h cu&s;toms; but it never could be its intention to act again&s;t the principles of liberty, by forbidding its citi|zens to a&s;&s;i&s;t in promoting tho&s;e principles in foreign countries; neither could it be its intention to act again&s;t the principles of gratitude. France had aided America in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her revolution, when invaded and oppre&s;&s;ed by England and her auxiliaries. France in her turn was invaded and oppre&s;&s;ed by a combination of foreign de&s;pots. In this &s;ituation I con|ceived it an act of gratitude in me, as a citizen of America, to render her in return the be&s;t &s;ervices I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England when I received the
<PB N="36" REF="37">invitation) not to enjoy ea&s;e, emoluments, and foppi&s;h ho|nours, as the article &s;uppo&s;es; but to encounter difficulties and dangers in defence of liberty; and I much que&s;tion whe|ther tho&s;e who now malignantly &s;eek (for &s;ome I believe do) to turn this to my injury, would have had courage to have done the &s;ame. I am &s;ure Governor Morris would not. He told me the &s;econd day after my arrival (in Paris), that the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians, who were then at Verdun, would be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, &s;aid he, that &s;eventy thou&s;and di&s;ciplined troops can be &s;topt in their march by any power in France.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;ons I have already given for accepting the invitation to the Convention, I had another that has reference particularly to America, which I mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left London to come to Paris: <Q>That it was to the intere&s;t of America that the &s;y&s;tem of European governments &s;hould be changed, and placed on the &s;ame principle with her own.</Q></P>
<P>It is certain that governments upon &s;imilar &s;y&s;tems agree better together, than tho&s;e that are founded on principles di&s;|cordant with each other; and the &s;ame rule holds good with re&s;pect to the people living under them. In the latter ca&s;e they offend each other by pity, or by reproach; and the di&s;|cordancy carries it&s;elf to matters of commerce. I am not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious Ameri|can. I have wi&s;hed to &s;ee America the <HI>Mother Church</HI> of go|vernment.</P>
<P>I have now &s;tated &s;ufficient matter to &s;how that the article in que&s;tion is not applicable to me; and that any &s;uch appli|cation to my injury, as well in circum&s;tances as in rights, is contrary both to the letter and intention of that article, and is illegal and uncon&s;titutional. Neither do I believe that any jury in America, when they are informed of the whole of the ca&s;e, would give a verdict to deprive me of my rights upon that article. The citizens of America, I believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect explanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were the merits of the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the per&s;on who was pro&s;ecuted for acting as prize-ma&s;ter to a French privateer, but I know that the jury gave a verdict again&s;t the pro&s;ecution. The rights I have acquired are dear to me. They have been acquired by honourable means, and by dangerous &s;ervice in the wor&s;t of times, and I cannot pa&s;&s;ively permit them to be wre&s;ted from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the ca&s;e in|volves a con&s;titutional and public que&s;tion, which is, how far the power of the federal government extends, in depriving any citizen of his rights of citizen&s;hip, or of &s;u&s;pending them.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">That the explanation of national treaties belongs to Con|gre&s;s, is &s;trictly con&s;titutional; but not the explanation of the con&s;titution it&s;elf, any more than the explanation of law in the ca&s;e of individual citizens. The&s;e are altogether judiciary que&s;tions. It is however worth ob&s;erving, that Congre&s;s, in explaining the article of the treaty with re&s;pect to French prizes and French privateers, confined it&s;elf &s;trictly to the let|ter of the article. Let them explain the article of the con&s;ti|tution with re&s;pect to me in the &s;ame manner, and the deci|&s;ion, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my rights of citizen&s;hip, or &s;u&s;pend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king, prince, &s;tate, or government.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that I &s;peak as if the federal government had made &s;ome declaration upon the &s;ubject of my citizen&s;hip; whereas the fact is otherwi&s;e; and your &s;ay|ing that you have no orders re&s;pecting me, is a proof of it. They, therefore, who propagate the report of my not being con&s;idered as a citizen of America by government, do it to the prolongation of my impri&s;onment, and without authority; for Congre&s;s, <HI>as a government,</HI> has neither decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into con&s;ideration; and I reque&s;t you to caution &s;uch per&s;ons again&s;t &s;preading &s;uch reports.&mdash;But be the&s;e matters as they may, I cannot have a doubt that you find and feel the ca&s;e very different, &s;ince you have heard what I have to &s;ay, and known what my &s;ituation is, than you did before your arrival.</P>
<P>Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a con&s;olation to me to believe, that my impri&s;onment proves to the world, that I had no &s;hare in the murderous &s;y&s;tem that then reigned. That I was an enemy to it, both morally and politically, is known, to all who had any knowledge of me; and could I have written French as well as I can Engli&s;h, I would pub|lickly have expo&s;ed its wickedne&s;s, and &s;hown the ruin with which it was pregnant.&mdash;They who have e&s;teemed me on former occa&s;ions, whether in America, or in Europe, will, I know, feel no cau&s;e to abate that e&s;teem, when they reflect, that <HI>impri&s;onment with pre&s;ervation of character, is preferable to liberty with di&s;grace.</HI></P>
<P>The letter before quoted in the fir&s;t page of this memorial, &s;ays, <Q>it would be out of character for an American mini&s;ter to interfere in the internal affairs of France.</Q>&mdash;This goes on the idea that I am a citizen of France, and a member of the Convention; which is not the fact. The convention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declared me to be a foreigner; and con&s;equently the citizen&s;hip and the election are null and void. It al&s;o has the appearance of a deci&s;ion, that the article of the con&s;titution
<PB N="38" REF="39">re&s;pecting grants made to American citizens by foreign kings, princes, or &s;tates, is applicable to me; which is the very point in que&s;tion, and again&s;t the application of which I con|tend. I &s;tate evidence to the mini&s;ter to &s;how, that I am not within the letter or meaning of that article, that it cannot operate again&s;t me; and I apply to him for the protection that, I conceive, I have a right to a&s;k, and to receive. The internal affairs of France are out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to my application, or his interference. I a&s;k it aot as a citi|zen of France, for I am not one; I a&s;k it not as a member of the Convention, for I am not one; both the&s;e, as before &s;aid, have been rendered null and void; I a&s;k it, not as a man again&s;t whom there is any accu&s;ation, for there is none; I a&s;k it, not as an exile from America, whole liberties I have honourably and generou&s;ly contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h; I a&s;k it as a citizen of America, deprived of his liberty in France, under the plea of being a foreigner; and I a&s;k it, becau&s;e I conceive I am entitled to it upon every principle of con&s;titutional ju&s;tice and national honour.</P>
