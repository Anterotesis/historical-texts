<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER to a Mem|ber of the SURRY Committee.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&mdash; I Have paid all the attention, that the &s;hortne&s;s of the time would permit, in &s;earching and procuring authorities, to enable you to oppo&s;e the objections lately made to <HI>annual parlia|ments,</HI> as &s;tated in your kind letter of the 17th in&s;tant. &mdash; With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, i. e. their <Q>incompetency, now that the empire is &s;o va&s;t, and foreign connections &s;o interwoven with us;</Q> I beg leave to remind you, that the empire is not now more interwoven with foreign connec|tions, (I mean tho&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> which a|lone have power to affect us,) than they were when <HI>annual</HI> parliaments (and <HI>"more often if need be"</HI>) were the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed law of the land; I mean in the
<PB N="4" REF="3">
glorious reign of king Edward III. when <HI>&s;everal</HI> of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>populous provinces of France</HI> were the hereditary dominions of the family upon the throne; and when the remainder of that mighty and exten&s;ive empire, with the exception of a very few provinces, (the great duke of Burgundy him&s;elf doing homage for his e&s;tates,) belonged ab&s;olutely to the crown of England, by the right of con|que&s;t. But the true con&s;titutional an|&s;wer to the objection is, that all foreign dominions, acquired by the crown of England, <HI>ought to be governed by free par|liaments of their own,</HI> duly elected by the inhabitants of each di&s;tinct country re&s;|pectively, who have not only the <HI>be&s;t right,</HI> but the <HI>be&s;t knowledge and abilities,</HI> how to pre&s;cribe laws for their own go|vernment, &s;afety, and nece&s;&s;ities. This is the only true means of removing all dif|ficulty from the government of <HI>di&s;tant do|minions,</HI> becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, it is
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the only means that is &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>natural rights</HI> of the inhabitants in each dominion, &s;eparately con&s;idered; and al&s;o, 2dly, the only means of pre|venting the inhabitants of &s;uch di&s;tant dominions or colonies, from invading the <HI>natural rights</HI> of <HI>each other,</HI> which is the &s;ource of civil war and di&s;union; and, if this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principle of our <HI>con&s;ti|tution,</HI> and of <HI>natural equity,</HI> had been regarded by admini&s;tration, agreeably to what I have &s;tated, in my Declaration of the Peoples Rights, re&s;pecting <HI>Ireland,</HI> we &s;hould not have lo&s;t <HI>America!</HI> &mdash; The only true means, for in&s;tance, to pre&s;erve the Briti&s;h empire in <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> which &s;till remains to us, is, to in&s;truct the Sooders, and lower ca&s;ts of the Indian tribes, concerning their <HI>natural right to a &s;hare in the government</HI> of tho&s;e coun|tries which they inhabit, that their duly elected repre&s;entatives, in a general a&s;|&s;embly, may have confidence to reject
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and confute that dete&s;table lie of the Bra|mins, by which they are holden in &s;la|very, and rendered the prey of Tartarian, as well as European, wolves and tigers.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h company of merchants, aided by the Briti&s;h government, have, at pre&s;ent, both power and influence &s;uf|ficient to effect this, and re&s;tore them to their rights: this would be an obligation never to be forgotten, and which would e&s;tabli&s;h trade upon its proper ba&s;is, and <HI>remove all difficulties, as well as expence, from the government of that va&s;t empire;</HI> but, if the opportunity be too long ne|glected, it may be &s;uddenly lo&s;t for ever!</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd objection, &mdash; <Q>The apprehen&s;ions of di&s;order on too frequent elections.</Q> &mdash; The evidence of experience confutes it, as, I hope, I have already proved in the two little tracts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Legal Means of political Reformation, in two tracts, p. 31 and 32, al&s;o 55 and 56. See al&s;o the three la&s;t paragraphs of the Memorial of the Deputies from the &s;everal petitioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein it is declared, concerning ANNUAL parliaments, that <Q>they were ever de&s;cribed as con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t peace, and mo&s;t peaceably conducted.</Q></NOTE>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and of which the preamble to the wicked act of the 8th of king Henry VI. is it&s;elf an ample te&s;timony; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>legal Means, &amp;c.</HI> p. 29, 30.</NOTE> becau&s;e the per|verters of the con&s;titution, at that time, could not &s;ay that <Q>man-&s;laughter, ri|ots, batteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> had <HI>then</HI> happen|ed, as they really <HI>do now</HI> at our <HI>&s;eptennial elections,</HI> but only in the <HI>future</HI> ten&s;e, that <HI>"they &s;hall very likely ari&s;e and be."</HI> They could not complain, that there were a <HI>number of outrageous people</HI> at county elec|tions, and therefore they perver&s;ely and deceitfully complained only of an <HI>outrage|ous and exce&s;&s;ive number of people:</HI> the epi|thet, <HI>"outrageous,"</HI> was not applicable to the people, and therefore they have deceitfully branded the innocent &s;ub&s;tan|tive, <HI>"number,"</HI> with the charge of being <HI>"outrageous."</HI> The rea&s;on of this is
<PB N="8" REF="7">
plain: the manner of wording the act, as it now &s;tands, has the effect of an in|&s;inuation again&s;t the behaviour of the people, that is, to a <HI>carele&s;s reader,</HI> and thereby it an&s;wered the deceitful purpo&s;e of tho&s;e who framed (or tran&s;lated) the act, which would have been <HI>null and void</HI> for want of <HI>truth,</HI> had the adjective, <HI>"outrageous,"</HI> been applied to the other &s;ub&s;tantive, i. e. <HI>people;</HI> for <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> in a preamble has the unque&s;tionable effect of de&s;troying the force of any &s;tatute.</P>
<P>But, if the people really were <HI>outrageous</HI> at elections, as well as <HI>exce&s;&s;ively numerous,</HI> yet, it is certain, that they had <HI>right</HI> on their &s;ide, and intended the good of the kingdom in general; becau&s;e they have the evidence of all antiquity, that the <HI>majority</HI> of the&s;e exce&s;&s;ive numbers were generally for &s;ending to parliament the be&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable men they could find among them; which is not only pro|ved by the te&s;timony I quoted from
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Prynne, in p. 31 and 32 of my fir&s;t little tract,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>For a</HI> more equal repre&s;entation, &amp;c.</NOTE> but al&s;o by the evidence of that learned antiquarian, Browne Willis, E&s;q. who tells us, in the preface of his <HI>Noti|tia parliamentaria,</HI> that <Q>the knights of &s;hires</Q> (viz. tho&s;e that were cho&s;en by the <HI>outrageous and exce&s;&s;ive number of peo|ple</HI>) <Q>have, EVER, IN ALL COUNTIES, been cho&s;en out of the principal <HI>gentry and quality:</HI> and though, &s;ays he, the citizens and burge&s;&s;es were hereto|fore elected out of their re&s;pective communities, and were only the CHIEF and MOST EMINENT MERCHANTS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their own communities or cor|porate bodies; yet, in king Edward IV.'s time, we find a great many of them di&s;tingui&s;hed by titles,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This affords a farther an&s;wer al&s;o to the fir&s;t objection again&s;t <HI>annual</HI> parliaments.</P>
<P>For who are &s;o fit to judge of public affairs, <Q><HI>now that the empire</HI> is &s;o va&s;t,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and foreign connexions &s;o interwoven with us,</Q> (according to the objector's &s;ta|ting,) as <Q>the principal gentry and qua|lity</Q> out of the counties, and the <HI>"chief and mo&s;t eminent merchants"</HI> out of the trading cities and boroughs? and more e&s;pecially &s;uch knights, citizens, and burge&s;&s;es, as tho&s;e of ancient times, who&s;e conduct in parliament procured them <HI>the honour</HI> of being <HI>annually retur|ned,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>more often,</HI> for &s;eve|ral years together?</P>
<P>Thus, the two fir&s;t objections again&s;t <HI>annual elections</HI> are manife&s;tly without foundation; and, with re&s;pect to the third, that <Q>it never was the law of the land,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So far is this objection from the <HI>truth,</HI> that the de|puties from the &s;everal petitioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have, in their MEMORIAL, declared, that <Q><HI>&s;hortening the du|ration of the &s;itting of parliament can only be done,</HI> CON|SISTENTLY WITH <HI>the</HI> CONSTITUTION, <HI>or with the be&s;t policy on any enlarged view, by &s;hortening it</HI> TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR;</Q> and they afterwards cite the ancient acts, which ordained, that <Q>a parliament &s;hall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.</Q></NOTE> it &s;avours either of &s;uch deplo|rable
<PB N="11" REF="10">
ignorance, or of &s;uch bare-faced fal&s;ehood and effrontery, as &s;carcely de|&s;erves an an&s;wer!</P>
<P>If I have made any error or mi&s;repre|&s;entation in either of the little tracts, let the objectors point it out, and they will not find me backward to &s;ubmit to <HI>truth;</HI> for that is my duty to God and man! &mdash; But, to condemn the doctrine in the lump, without deigning to give a &s;ingle rea&s;on or proof again&s;t it, though it is &s;up|ported by the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable hi&s;to|rical evidence, of which many even of the <HI>original</HI> documents (I mean the <HI>an|nual,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;e&s;&s;ional, writs</HI> them&s;elves) do &s;till exi&s;t, in our public records, to this day, is &s;uch a dete&s;table perver&s;ion of <HI>truth,</HI> &s;uch a depravity of human nature, in the baneful &s;ervice of our great natu|ral enemy, the <HI>"father of lies,"</HI> that I &s;hould hardly have believed my own ears, had I been pre&s;ent when the objection was made.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">Per&s;ons, who di&s;cover &s;uch impotent malice again&s;t <HI>truth,</HI> mu&s;t be warned of their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> danger, le&s;t they &s;hould be lo&s;t for ever!</P>
<P>That you may be able more ea&s;ily to confute &s;uch objectors, I have &s;ent you Browne Willis's Notitia parliamentaria; where you will find, in the very fir&s;t ta|ble of writs, (viz. that for the county of Bedford,) examples of <HI>annual</HI> elections for twenty years together, in continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, except in one &s;ingle in&s;tance; which omi&s;&s;ion will be the more ea&s;ily excu&s;ed, if it be con&s;idered that there were <HI>two general elections</HI> in the year which <HI>preceded</HI> the year of omi&s;&s;ion, as al&s;o <HI>two general elections</HI> in the year which <HI>followed</HI> it. &mdash; The period I refer to is be|tween the 15th of king Edward II. and the 15th of king Edward III. In the 6th year of the latter reign, there were <HI>three</HI> new parliaments; two in the 7th, two in the 10th, two in the 11th, two
<PB N="13" REF="12">
in the 12th, two in the 13th, and FOUR in the 14th, year.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was an ancient u&s;age of our Saxon ance&s;tors, to hold <HI>provincial parliaments,</HI> or <HI>&s;hire-gemots,</HI> regularly twice a year. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">&mdash;<Q>For the a&s;&s;embling of parliament; which, by the in&s;ti|tution of king Alfred, was <HI>to a&s;&s;emble twice a year.</HI></Q> See the &s;peech of &s;ir George Crooke, Ju&s;tice of the king's-bench, in Hampden's trial on &s;hip-money. Anno 1637, 13 and 14 Car.</NOTE> <HI>"Twa &s;chire-gemot,"</HI> or <HI>two county parli|aments,</HI> are expre&s;sly ordained to be holden <HI>"on gear,"</HI> (i. e. <HI>"in a year,"</HI>) by the 5th law of king Edgar, and the 17th law of Canute. See Lambard's Archionomia, p. 64 and 111.</NOTE> This affords ample proof, not only that <HI>new</HI> parliaments &s;hould be holden every year <HI>once,</HI> but even <HI>"more often if need be."</HI> The book con|tains a great abundance of other exam|ples: and, though the <HI>annual</HI> elections were &s;ometimes omitted, yet this affords no proof again&s;t the peoples <HI>right</HI> to have them. Another learned antiquarian, Mr. Gurdon, informs us, in his Hi&s;tory of the high Court of Parliament, page 282, that <Q><HI>new</HI> &s;ummon&s;es were to go out for a <HI>new</HI> parliament,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>The continuance of parliaments for a longer term, without <HI>re-election,</HI> &s;eems to have been begun in the reign of king Edward IV. after the people had been &s;o cruelly harra&s;&s;ed by civil war, that they had no &s;pirit or (perhaps) <HI>power</HI> left to oppo&s;e that dangerous u&s;ur|pation of their parliamentary rights by <HI>royal prorogations.</HI></P>
<P>In preceding times the <HI>adjournments,</HI> or <HI>prorogations,</HI> (which words had then the &s;ame meaning,) were &s;eldom for more than <HI>a few days</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">8 Richard II. <Q>The &s;ame Saturday the parliament, for certain cau&s;es, by the <HI>commandment,</HI> was ADJOURNED until <HI>Monday en&s;u|ing;</HI> and, on the &s;ame <HI>Monday,</HI> it was <HI>adjourned</HI> until <HI>Tue&s;day next following,</HI> for the like cau&s;e, at the <HI>king's commandment.</HI></Q> <HI>See &s;ir Rob.
