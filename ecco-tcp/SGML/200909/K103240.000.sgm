<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author pre&s;umes to lay the following Tracts before the Public with the greater confidence, as he hopes the&s;e productions of his lei&s;ure will be found to bear a due relation to the engagements of his official duty.</P>
<P>The preference given of late, even among profe&s;&s;ed philo&s;ophers, to &s;tudies of a le&s;s ab&s;tract kind, has too frequently diverted the pur&s;uits of mathematicians into paths le&s;s &s;uited to their talents, from the de&s;ire of a vain and fleeting popularity, in&s;tead of the more laudable ambition of making real improvements in the &s;ciences which they had profe&s;&s;ed to cultivate. The humble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which the author has ever entertained of the limits of his own abilities, has, he hopes, pre&s;erved him from this common and pernicious vanity. However &s;olicitous to extend and diver|&s;ify his own acquirements, he can only hope to add, and that a little, to the public &s;tock of knowledge, in tho&s;e parts of &s;cience to which his early
<PB N="vi" REF="4">habits, and &s;ub&s;equent occupations, have led him peculiarly to con&s;e|create his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>The very honourable di&s;tinction paid to the author by the Royal Society, for his former experiments in gunnery, as well as their general indulgence to his attempts in other mathematical &s;ubjects, would perhaps have given an obvious de&s;tination to the&s;e papers, had he not thought their publication in a collective form, better adapted, from the connec|tion of their &s;ubject, to extend their utility.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ix tracts in this volume will be found to have an obvious connection in re&s;pect to their &s;ubject; having all of them a tendency either to illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory, or improve the theory of that &s;pecies of mathematical quantities called Series. The particular &s;ubjects of the&s;e tracts are &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the introduction to each of them, re|&s;pectively, to render any previous detail unnece&s;&s;ary in this place. The author hopes, however, they will be thought to have &s;ome claim to the merit of invention; and that their utility will be readily recognized by tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and eighth tracts are rather detached in their nature, re|lating to &s;ubjects purely geometrical. It is hoped, however, that the former of them, being an inve&s;tigation of &s;ome new and curious properties of the &s;phere and cone, which have always been a fruitful and favourite &s;ource of exerci&s;e to geometricians, will be both acceptable and u&s;eful
<PB N="vii" REF="5">to tho&s;e who are engaged in &s;imilar &s;peculations. The latter problem, concerning the geometrical divi&s;ion of a circle, having hitherto been deemed impracticable, the &s;olution of it is here given, it is pre&s;umed, for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>The large&s;t, and, in the author's opinion, the mo&s;t important of the&s;e tracts, is the ninth, or la&s;t; the main purpo&s;e of which is altogether practical, though founded in a very &s;ubtle and complex theory.</P>
<P>Though the late excellent Mr. Robins fir&s;t &s;hewed the importance of this theory, and invented a very curious mechanical apparatus for the experiments which he made to verify it, the author is per&s;uaded that none have been hitherto made with cannon balls &s;o completely, as tho&s;e here related and de&s;cribed; and that the&s;e are the fir&s;t from which the <HI>Data</HI> for determining the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium can be accurately derived. It has been the author's great object, next to the accuracy of the experiments, and the full and preci&s;e de&s;cription of them, to &s;implify the theorems deduced from them, or from the theory it&s;elf; of which an example may be found in the new rule given for the velocity of the ball. And it is pre&s;umed that the table of the corre&s;ponding <HI>Data,</HI> namely, of the Dimen&s;ions and Elevation of the gun, and the Range, Velocity and Time of &s;light of the ball, is now &s;o accurately framed, and &s;o per&s;picuous, that the &s;everal ca&s;es of gunnery may be very certainly and ea&s;ily referred to it; and rules of practice, adapted to the common purpo&s;es of the artilleri&s;t, may be very readily formed upon the&s;e principles.</P>

<HEAD><HI>TRACT I.</HI> A Di&s;&s;ertation on the Nature and Value of Infinite Series.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ABOUT five years &s;ince I di&s;covered a very general and ea&s;y method of valuing &s;eries who&s;e terms are alternately po&s;itive and negative, which equally applies to &s;uch &s;eries, whether they be converging, or diverging, or their terms all equal; together with &s;eve|ral other properties relating to certain &s;eries: and as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to deliver &s;ome of tho&s;e matters in the cour&s;e of the&s;e tracts, I &s;hall take this opportunity of premi&s;ing a few ideas and remarks on the nature and valuation of &s;ome of the cla&s;&s;es of &s;eries which form the object of tho&s;e communications. This is done with a view to obviate
<PB N="2" REF="7">any mi&s;conceptions that might, perhaps, be made concerning the idea annexed to the term <HI>value</HI> of &s;uch &s;eries in tho&s;e intended tracts, and the &s;en&s;e in which it is there always to be under&s;tood; which is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as many controver&s;ies have been warmly agitated concerning the&s;e matters, not only of late, by &s;ome of our own countrymen, but al&s;o by others among the able&s;t mathematicians in Europe, at different periods in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century; and all this, it &s;eems, through the want of &s;pecifying in what &s;en&s;e the term <HI>value</HI> or <HI>&s;um</HI> was to be under&s;tood in their di&s;&s;ertations. And in this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall follow, in a great mea&s;ure, the &s;entiments and manner of the late famous L. Euler, contained in a &s;imilar memoir of his in the fifth volume of the New Peter&s;burgh Commentaries, adding and intermix|ing here and there other remarks and ob&s;ervations of my own.</P>
<P N="2">2. By a converging &s;eries, I mean &s;uch a one who&s;e terms continually decrea&s;e; and by a diverging &s;eries, that who&s;e terms continually in|crea&s;e. So that a &s;eries who&s;e terms neither increa&s;e nor decrea&s;e, but are all equal, as they neither converge nor diverge, may be called a neutral &s;eries, as <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; &amp;c. Now converging &s;eries, being &s;uppo&s;ed infinitely continued, may have their terms decrea&s;ing to o as a limit, as the &s;eries 1 &minus; &frac12; &plus; &frac13; &minus; &frac14; &plus; &amp;c. or only decrea&s;ing to &s;ome finite magnitude as a limit, as the &s;eries 2/1 &minus; 3/2 &plus; 4/3 &minus; 5/4 &plus; &amp;c. which tends continually to 1 as a limit. So in like manner, diverging &s;eries may have their terms tending to a limit that is either finite or infinitely great; thus the terms 1 &minus; 2 &plus; 3 &minus; 4 &plus; &amp;c. diverge to infinity, but the diverging terms &frac12; &minus; &frac23; &plus; &frac34; &minus; &frac45; &plus; &amp;c. only to the finite magnitude 1. Hence then, as the ultimate terms of &s;eries which do not converge to o, by &s;uppo&s;ing them continued <HI>in infinitum,</HI> may be either finite or infinite, there will be two kinds of &s;uch &s;eries, each of which will be farther divided into two &s;pecies, according as the terms &s;hall either be all affected with the &s;ame &s;ign, or have alternately the &s;igns &plus; and &minus;. We &s;hall, therefore, have altogether four &s;pecies of &s;eries which do not converge to o, an example of each of which may be as here follows:

</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3. Now concerning the &s;ums of the&s;e &s;pecies of &s;eries, there have been great di&s;&s;en&s;ions among mathematicians; &s;ome affirming that they can be expre&s;&s;ed by a certain &s;um, while others deny it. In the fir&s;t place, however, it is evident that the &s;ums of &s;uch &s;eries as come under the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;pecies, will be really infinitely great, &s;ince by actually collecting the terms, we can arrive at a &s;um greater than any propo&s;ed number whatever: and hence there can be no doubt but that the &s;ums of this &s;pecies of &s;eries may be exhibited by expre&s;&s;ions of this kind <HI>a</HI>/<HI>0.</HI> It is concerning the other &s;pecies, therefore, that mathe|maticians have chiefly differed; and the arguments which both &s;ides allege in defence of their opinions, have been endued with &s;uch force, that neither party could hitherto be brought to yield to the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the &s;econd &s;pecies, the famous Leibnitz was one of the fir&s;t who treated of this &s;eries 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; &amp;c. and he concluded the &s;um of it to &equals; &frac12;, relying upon the following cogent rea&s;ons. And fir&s;t, that this &s;eries ari&s;es by re&s;olving the fraction 1/1&plus;<HI>a</HI> into the &s;eries 1 &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI>^2 &minus; <HI>a</HI>^3 &plus; <HI>a</HI>^4 &minus; <HI>a</HI>^5 &plus; &amp;c. by continual divi&s;ion in the u&s;ual way, and taking the value of <HI>a</HI> equal to unity. Secondly, for more confirmation, and for per&s;uading &s;uch as are not accu&s;tomed to cal|culations, he rea&s;ons in the following manner: If the &s;eries terminate any where, and if the number of the terms be even, then its value will be &equals; 0;
<PB N="4" REF="9">but if the number of terms be odd, the value of the &s;eries will be &equals; 1: but becau&s;e the &s;eries proceeds <HI>in infinitum,</HI> and that the number of the terms cannot be reckoned either odd or even, we may conclude that the &s;um is neither &equals; 0, nor &equals; 1, but that it mu&s;t obtain a certain middle value, equidifferent from both, and which is therefore &equals; &frac12;. And thus, he adds, nature adheres to the univer&s;al law of ju&s;tice, giving no partial preference to either &s;ide.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again&s;t the&s;e arguments the adver&s;e party make u&s;e of &s;uch objec|tions as the following. Fir&s;t, that the fraction 1/1&plus;<HI>a</HI> is not equal to the infinite &s;eries 1 &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI>^2 &minus; <HI>a</HI>^3 &plus; &amp;c. unle&s;s <HI>a</HI> be a fraction le&s;s than unity. For if the divi&s;ion be any where broken off, and the quotient of the remainder be added, the cau&s;e of the paralogi&s;m will be mani|fe&s;t; for we &s;hall then have <GAP DESC="math">; and that although the number <HI>n</HI> &s;hould be made infi|nite, yet the &s;upplemental fraction <GAP DESC="math"> ought not to be omitted, unle&s;s it &s;hould become evane&s;cent, which happens only in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which <HI>a</HI> is le&s;s than 1, and the terms of the &s;eries converge to 0. But that in other ca&s;es there ought always to be included this kind of &s;upplement <GAP DESC="math">; and although it be affected with the dubious &s;ign <GAP DESC="math">, namely &minus; or &plus; according as <HI>n</HI> &s;hall be an even or an odd number, yet if <HI>n</HI> be infinite, it may not therefore be omitted, under the pretence that an infinite number is neither odd nor even, and that there is no rea&s;on why the one &s;ign &s;hould be u&s;ed rather than the other; for it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that there can be any integer number, even although it be infinite, which is neither odd nor even.</P>
<P N="6">6. But this objection is rejected by tho&s;e who attribute determinate &s;ums to diverging &s;eries, becau&s;e it con&s;iders an infinite number as a determinate number, and therefore either odd or even, when it is really
<PB N="5" REF="10">indeterminate. For that it is contrary to the very idea of a &s;eries, &s;aid to proceed <HI>in infinitum,</HI> to conceive any term of it as the la&s;t, although infinite: and that therefore the objection above-mentioned, of the &s;upplement to be added or &s;ubtracted, naturally falls of it&s;elf. Therefore, &s;ince an infinite &s;eries never terminates, we never can arrive at the place where that &s;upplement mu&s;t be joined; and therefore that the &s;upplement not only may, but indeed ought to be neglected, becau&s;e there is no place found for it.</P>
<P>And the&s;e arguments, adduced either for or again&s;t the &s;ums of &s;uch &s;eries as above, hold al&s;o in the fourth &s;pecies, which is not otherwi&s;e embarra&s;&s;ed with any further doubts peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="7">7. But tho&s;e who di&s;pute again&s;t the &s;ums of &s;uch &s;eries, think they have the firme&s;t hold in the third &s;pecies. For although the terms of the&s;e &s;eries continually increa&s;e, and that, by actually collect|ing the terms, we can arrive at a &s;um greater than any a&s;&s;ignable num|ber, which is the very definition of infinity; yet the patrons of the &s;ums are forced to admit, in this &s;pecies, &s;eries who&s;e &s;ums are not only finite, but even negative, or le&s;s than nothing. For &s;ince the fraction 1/1&minus;<HI>a</HI>^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, by evolving it by divi&s;ion, becomes 1 &plus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI>^2 &plus; <HI>a</HI>^3 &plus; <HI>a</HI>^4 &plus; &amp;c. we &s;hould have
<LIST>
<ITEM>1/1&minus;2 &equals; &minus; 1 &equals; 1 &plus; 2 &plus; 4 &plus; 8 &plus; 16 &plus; &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1/1&minus;3 &equals; &minus; &frac12; &equals; 1 &plus; 3 &plus; 9 &plus; 27 &plus; 81 &plus; &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST> which their adver&s;aries, not unde&s;ervedly, hold to be ab&s;urd, &s;ince by the addition of affirmative numbers, we can never obtain a negative &s;um; and hence they urge that there is the greater nece&s;&s;ity for includ|ing the before-mentioned &s;upplement additive, &s;ince by taking it in, it is evident that &minus; 1 &equals; 1 &plus; 2 &plus; 4 &plus; 8 ........ 2^n &plus; 2^n&plus;1/1&minus;2, although <HI>n</HI> &s;hould be an infinite number.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="6" REF="11">8. The defenders therefore of the &s;ums of &s;uch &s;eries, in order to reconcile this &s;triking paradox, more &s;ubtle perhaps than true, make a di&s;tinction between negative quantities; for they argue that while &s;ome are le&s;s than nothing, there are others greater than infinite, or above infinity. Namely, that the one value of &minus;1 ought to be under&s;tood, when it is conceived to ari&s;e from the &s;ubtraction of a greater number <HI>a</HI> &plus; 1 from a le&s;s <HI>a;</HI> but the other value, when it is found equal to the &s;eries 1 &plus; 2 &plus; 4 &plus; 8 &plus; &amp;c. and ari&s;ing from the divi&s;ion of the number 1 by &minus;1; for that in the former ca&s;e it is le&s;s than nothing, but in the latter greater than infinite. For the more confirmation, they bring this example of fractions &frac14;, &frac13;, &frac12;, 1/1, 1/0, 1/&minus;1, 1/&minus;2, 1/&minus;3, &amp;c. which, evidently increa&s;ing in the leading terms, it is inferred will con|tinually increa&s;e; and hence they conclude that 1/&minus;1 is greater than 1/0, and 1/&minus;2 greater than 1/&minus;1, and &s;o on: and therefore as 1/&minus;1 is expre&s;&s;ed by &minus;1, and 1/0 by &sim; or infinity, &minus;1 will be greater than &sim;, and much more will &minus;&frac12; be greater than &sim;. And thus they ingeniou&s;ly enough repel|led that apparent ab&s;urdity by it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="9">9. But although this di&s;tinction &s;eemed to be ingeniou&s;ly devi&s;ed, it gave but little &s;atisfaction to the adver&s;aries; and be&s;ides, it &s;eemed to affect the truth of the rules of algebra. For if the two values of &minus;1, namely 1 &minus; 2 and 1/&minus;1, be really different from each other, as we may not confound them, the certainty and the u&s;e of the rules, which we follow in making calculations, would be quite done away; which would be a greater ab&s;urdity than that for who&s;e &s;ake the di&s;tinction was devi&s;ed: but if 1 &minus; 2 &equals; 1/&minus;1, as the rules of algebra require, for by multiplication <GAP DESC="math">, the matter in debate is not &s;ettled; &s;ince the quantity &minus;1, to which the &s;eries 1 &plus; 2 &plus; 4 &plus; 8 &plus; &amp;c. is made equal, is le&s;s than nothing, and therefore the &s;ame difficulty &s;till remains. In the mean time however, it &s;eems but agreeable to truth, to &s;ay that the &s;ame quantities which are below nothing, may be
<PB N="7" REF="12">taken as above infinite. For we know, not only from algebra, but from geometry al&s;o, that there are two ways, by which quantities pa&s;s from po&s;itive to negative, the one through the cypher or nothing, and the other through infinity: and be&s;ides that quantities, either by in|crea&s;ing or decrea&s;ing from the cypher, return again, and revert to the &s;ame term o; &s;o that quantities more than infinite are the &s;ame with quantities le&s;s than nothing, like as quantities le&s;s than infinite agree with quantities greater than nothing.</P>
<P N="10">10. But, farther, tho&s;e who deny the truth of the &s;ums that have been a&s;&s;igned to diverging &s;eries, not only omit to a&s;&s;ign other values for the &s;ums, but even &s;et them&s;elves utterly to oppo&s;e all &s;ums belong|ing to &s;uch &s;eries, as things merely imaginary. For a converging &s;eries, as &s;uppo&s;e this 1 &plus; &frac12; &plus; &frac14; &plus; &frac18; &plus; &amp;c. will admit of a &s;um &equals; 2, becau&s;e the more terms of this &s;eries we actually add, the nearer we come to the number 2: but in diverging &s;eries the ca&s;e is quite different; for the more terms we add, the more do the &s;ums which are produced differ from one another, neither do they ever tend to any certain deter|minate value. Hence they conclude that no idea of a &s;um can be applied to diverging &s;eries, and that the labour of tho&s;e per&s;ons who employ them&s;elves in inve&s;tigating the &s;ums of &s;uch &s;eries, is manife&s;tly u&s;ele&s;s, and indeed contrary to the very principles of analy&s;is.</P>
<P N="11">11. But notwith&s;tanding this &s;eemingly real difference, yet neither party could ever convict the other of any error, whenever the u&s;e of &s;eries of this kind has occurred in analy&s;is; and for this good rea&s;on, that neither party is in an error, but that the whole difference con&s;i&s;ts in words only. For if in any calculation I arrive at this &s;eries 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; &amp;c. and that I &s;ub&s;titute &frac12; in&s;tead of it; I &s;hall &s;urely not thereby commit any error; which however I &s;hould certainly incur if I &s;ub&s;titute any other number in&s;tead of that &s;eries; and hence there remains no doubt but that the &s;eries 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; &amp;c. and the
<PB N="8" REF="13">fraction &frac12;, are equivalent quantities, and that the one may always be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the other without error. So that the whole mat|ter in di&s;pute &s;eems to be reduced to this only, namely, whether the fraction &frac12; can be properly called the <HI>&s;um</HI> of the &s;eries 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; &amp;c. Now if any per&s;ons &s;hould ob&s;tinately deny this, &s;ince they will not however venture to deny the fraction to be equivalent to the &s;eries, it is greatly to be feared they will fall into mere quarrelling about words.</P>
<P N="12">12. But perhaps the whole di&s;pute will ea&s;ily be compromi&s;ed, by carefully attending to what follows. Whenever, in analy&s;is, we arrive at a complex function or expre&s;&s;ion, either fractional or tran&s;cendental; it is u&s;ual to convert it into a convenient &s;eries, to which the remaining calculus may be more ea&s;ily applied. And hence the occa&s;ion and ri&s;e of infinite &s;eries. So far only then do infinite &s;eries take place in analytics, as they ari&s;e from the evolution of &s;ome finite expre&s;&s;ion; and therefore, in&s;tead of an infinite &s;eries, in any calculus, we may &s;ub&s;titute that formula, from who&s;e evolution it aro&s;e. And hence, for performing calculations with more ea&s;e or more benefit, like as rules are u&s;ually given for converting into infinite &s;eries &s;uch finite expre&s;&s;ions as are endued with le&s;s proper forms; &s;o, on the other hand, tho&s;e rules are to be e&s;teemed not le&s;s u&s;eful by the help of which we may inve&s;ti|gate the finite expre&s;&s;ion from which a propo&s;ed infinite &s;eries would re&s;ult, if that finite expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be evolved by the proper rules: and &s;ince this expre&s;&s;ion may always, without error, be &s;ub&s;tituted in|&s;tead of the infinite &s;eries, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be of the &s;ame value: and hence no infinite &s;eries can be propo&s;ed, but a finite expre&s;&s;ion may, at the &s;ame time, be conceived as equivalent to it.</P>
<P N="13">13. If therefore, we only &s;o far change the received notion of a &s;um as to &s;ay, that the &s;um of any &s;eries, is the finite expre&s;&s;ion by the evolution of which that &s;eries may be produced, all the difficulties,
<PB N="9" REF="14">which have been agitated on both &s;ides, vani&s;h of them&s;elves. For, fir&s;t, that expre&s;&s;ion by who&s;e evolution a converging &s;eries is produced, exhibits at the &s;ame time its &s;um, in the common acceptation of the term: neither, if the &s;eries &s;hould be divergent, could the inve&s;tiga|tion be deemed at all more ab&s;urd, or le&s;s proper, namely, the &s;earch|ing out a finite expre&s;&s;ion which, being evolved according to the rules of algebra, &s;hall produce that &s;eries. And &s;ince that expre&s;&s;ion may be &s;ub&s;tituted in the calculation in&s;tead of this &s;eries, there can be no doubt but that it is equal to it. Which being the ca&s;e, we need not nece&s;&s;arily deviate from the u&s;ual mode of &s;peaking, but might be per|mitted to call that expre&s;&s;ion al&s;o the <HI>&s;um,</HI> which is <HI>equal</HI> to any &s;eries whatever, provided however, that, in &s;eries who&s;e terms do not con|verge to o, we do not connect that notion with this idea of a &s;um, namely, that the more terms of the &s;eries are actually collected, the nearer we mu&s;t approach to the value of the &s;um.</P>
<P N="14">14. But if any per&s;on &s;hall &s;till think it improper to apply the term &s;um, to the finite expre&s;&s;ions by who&s;e evolution all &s;eries in general are produced; it will make no difference in the nature of the thing; and in&s;tead of the word &s;um, for &s;uch finite expre&s;&s;ion, he may u&s;e the term value; or perhaps the term <HI>radix</HI> would be as proper as any other that could be employed for this purpo&s;e, as the &s;eries may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as i&s;&s;uing or growing out of it, like as a plant &s;prings from its root, or from its &s;eed. The choice of terms being in a great mea|&s;ure arbitrary, every per&s;on is at liberty to employ them in whatever &s;en&s;e he may think fit, or proper for the purpo&s;e in hand; provided always that he fix and determine the &s;en&s;e in which he under&s;tands or employs them. And as I con&s;ider any &s;eries, and the finite expre&s;&s;ion by who&s;e evolution that &s;eries may be produced, as no more than two different ways of expre&s;&s;ing one and the &s;ame thing, whether that finite expre&s;&s;ion be called the &s;um, or value, or radix of the &s;eries; &s;o in the following paper, and in &s;ome others which may perhaps hereafter
<PB N="10" REF="15">be produced, it is in this &s;en&s;e I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood when &s;earching out the value of &s;eries, namely, that the object of my enquiry, is the radix by who&s;e evolution the &s;eries may be produced, or el&s;e an ap|proximation to the value of it in decimal numbers, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>TRACT II. <HI>A new Method for the Valuation of Numeral Infinite Series, who&s;e Terms are alternately (&plus;) Plus and (&minus;) Minus; by taking continual Arith|metical Means between the Succe&s;&s;ive Sums, and their Means.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Article 1. THE remarkable difference between the facility which mathematicians have found in their endeavours to determine the values of infinite &s;eries who&s;e terms are alternately affirmative and negative, and the difficulty of doing the &s;ame thing with re&s;pect to tho&s;e &s;eries who&s;e terms are all affirmative, is one of tho&s;e &s;triking appearances in &s;cience which we can hardly per&s;uade our|&s;elves is true, even after we have &s;een many proofs of it, and which &s;erve to put us ever after on our guard not to tru&s;t to our fir&s;t notions, or conjectures, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, till we have brought them to the te&s;t of demon&s;tration. For, at fir&s;t &s;ight it is very natural to imagine, that tho&s;e infinite &s;eries who&s;e terms are all affirmative, or added to the fir&s;t term, mu&s;t be much &s;impler in their nature, and much ea&s;ier to be &s;ummed, than tho&s;e who&s;e terms are alternately affirmative and ne|gative; which, neverthele&s;s, we find, upon examination, to be directly contrary to the truth; the methods of finding the &s;ums of the latter &s;eries being numerous and ea&s;y, and al&s;o very general, whereas tho&s;e that have been hitherto di&s;covered for the &s;ummation of the former &s;eries, are few and difficult, and confined to &s;eries who&s;e terms are generated from each other according to &s;ome particular laws, in&s;tead of extending, as the other methods do, to all &s;orts of &s;eries, who&s;e terms are connected together by addition, by whatever law their terms are formed. Of this remarkable difference between the&s;e two &s;orts of &s;eries, the new method of finding the &s;ums of tho&s;e who&s;e terms are
<PB N="12" REF="17">alternately po&s;itive and negative, which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent paper, will afford us a &s;triking in&s;tance, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the happy qua|lities of &s;implicity, ea&s;e, per&s;picuity, and univer&s;ality in a great degree; and yet, as the e&s;&s;ence of it con&s;i&s;ts in the alternation of the &s;igns &plus; and &minus;, by which the terms are connected with the fir&s;t term, it is of no u&s;e in the &s;ummation of tho&s;e other &s;eries who&s;e terms are all con|nected with each other by the &s;ign &plus;.</P>
<P N="2">2. This method, &s;o ea&s;y and general, is, in &s;hort, &s;imply this: be|ginning at the fir&s;t term <HI>a</HI> of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; <HI>e</HI> &minus; <HI>f</HI> &plus; &amp;c. which is to be &s;ummed, compute &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive values of it, by taking in &s;ucce&s;&s;ively more and more terms, one term being taken in at a time; &s;o that the fir&s;t value of the &s;eries &s;hall be its fir&s;t term <HI>a,</HI> (or even <HI>o</HI> or nothing may begin the &s;eries of &s;ums); the next value &s;hall be its fir&s;t two terms <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b,</HI> reduced to one number; its next value &s;hall be the fir&s;t three terms <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c,</HI> reduced to one number; its next value &s;hall be the fir&s;t four terms <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d,</HI> reduced al&s;o to one number; and &s;o on. This, it is evident, may be done by means of the ea&s;y arithmetical operation of addition and &s;ubtraction. And then, having found a &s;ufficient number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive values of the &s;eries, more or le&s;s as the ca&s;e may require, interpo&s;e between the&s;e values a &s;et of arithmetical mean quantities or proportionals; and between the&s;e arithmetical means interpo&s;e a &s;econd &s;et of arithmetical mean quanti|ties; and between tho&s;e arithmetical means of the &s;econd &s;et, inter|po&s;e a third &s;et of arithmetical mean quantities; and &s;o on as far as you plea&s;e. By this proce&s;s we &s;oon find either the true value of the &s;eries propo&s;ed, when it has a determinate rational value, or otherwi&s;e we obtain &s;everal &s;ets of values approximating nearer and nearer to the &s;um of the &s;eries, both in the columns and in the lines, either horizon|tal or obliquely de&s;cending or a&s;cending; namely, both of the &s;everal &s;ets of means them&s;elves, and the &s;ets or &s;eries formed of any of their corre&s;ponding terms, as of all their fir&s;t terms, of their &s;econd terms,
<PB N="13" REF="18">of their third terms, &amp;c. or of their la&s;t terms, of their penultimate terms, of their antepenultimate terms, &amp;c. and if between any of the&s;e latter &s;ets, con&s;i&s;ting of the like or corre&s;ponding terms of the former &s;ets of arithmetical means, we again interpo&s;e new &s;ets of arithmetical means, as we did at fir&s;t with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, we &s;hall obtain other &s;ets of approximating terms, having the &s;ame properties as the former. And thus we may repeat the proce&s;s as often as we plea&s;e, which will be found very u&s;eful in the more difficult diverging &s;eries, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter. For this method, being derived only from the circum|&s;tance of the alternation of the &s;igns of the terms (&plus; and &minus;), it is there|fore not confined to converging &s;eries alone, but is equally applicable both to diverging &s;eries, and to <HI>neutral</HI> &s;eries, (by which la&s;t name I &s;hall take the liberty to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e &s;eries who&s;e terms are all of the &s;ame con&s;tant magnitude); namely, the application is equally the &s;ame for all the three following &s;orts of &s;eries, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>Converging, 1 &minus; &frac12; &plus; &frac13; &minus; &frac14; &plus; &frac15; &minus; &frac16; &plus; &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Diverging, 1 &minus; 2 &plus; 3 &minus; 4 &plus; 5 &minus; 6 &plus; &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Neutral, 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; 1 &minus; 1 &plus; &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST> As is demon&s;trated in what follows, and exemplified in a variety of in&s;tances.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be noted, however, that by the value of the &s;eries, I always mean &s;uch <HI>radix,</HI> or finite expre&s;&s;ion, as, by evolution, would produce the &s;eries in que&s;tion; according to the &s;en&s;e I have &s;tated in the former paper, on this &s;ubject; or an approximate value of &s;uch radix; and which radix, as it may be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the &s;eries in any operation, I call the value of the &s;eries.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is an obvious and well-known property of infinite &s;eries, with alternate &s;igns, that when we &s;eek their value by collecting their terms one after another, we obtain a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, which approach continually nearer and nearer to the true value of the propo&s;ed &s;eries, when it is a converging one, or one who&s;e terms always decrea&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="19">by &s;ome regular law; but in a diverging &s;eries, or one who&s;e terms as continually increa&s;e, tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums diverge always more and more from the true value of the &s;eries. And from the circum&s;tance of the alternate change of the &s;igns, it is al&s;o a property of tho&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, that when the la&s;t term which is included in the collection, is a po&s;itive one, then the &s;um obtained is too great, or exceeds the truth; but when the la&s;t collected term is negative, then the &s;um is too little, or below the truth. So that, in both the converging and diverging &s;eries, the fir&s;t term alone, being po&s;itive, exceeds the truth; the &s;econd &s;um, or the &s;um of the fir&s;t two terms, is below the truth; the third &s;um, or the &s;um of three terms, is above the truth; the fourth &s;um, or the &s;um of four terms, is below the truth; and &s;o on; the &s;um of any even number of terms being below the true value of the &s;eries, and the &s;um of any odd number, above it. All which is generally known, and evident from the nature and form of the &s;eries. So, of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; <HI>e</HI> &minus; <HI>f</HI> &plus; &amp;c. the fir&s;t &s;um <HI>a</HI> is too great; the &s;econd &s;um <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> too little; the third &s;um <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> too great; and &s;o on as in the following table, where <HI>s</HI> is the true value of the &s;eries, and o is placed before the collected &s;ums, to compleat the &s;eries, being the value when no terms are included:

<P N="4">4. Hence the value of every alternate &s;eries <HI>s,</HI> is po&s;itive, and le&s;s than the fir&s;t term <HI>a,</HI> the &s;eries being always &s;uppo&s;ed to begin with a po&s;itive term <HI>a;</HI> and con&s;equently if the &s;igns of all the terms be
<PB N="15" REF="20">changed, or if the &s;eries begin with a negative term, the value <HI>s</HI> will &s;till be the &s;ame, but negative, or the &s;ign of the &s;um will be changed, and the value become &minus;<HI>s</HI> &equals; &minus;<HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>b</HI> &minus; <HI>c</HI> &plus; <HI>d</HI> &minus; &amp;c. Al&s;o, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, in a converging &s;eries, always ap|proach nearer and nearer to the true value, while they recede always farther and farther from it in a diverging &s;eries; it follows that, in a neutral &s;eries, <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; &amp;c. which holds a middle place between the two former, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums o, <HI>a,</HI> o, <HI>a,</HI> o, <HI>a</HI> &amp;c. will neither converge nor diverge, but will be always at the &s;ame di&s;|tance from the value of the propo&s;ed &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &plus; &amp;c. and con&s;equently that value will always be &equals; &frac12;<HI>a,</HI> which holds every where the middle place between o and <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Now, with re&s;pect to a converging &s;eries, <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. becau&s;e o is below, and <HI>a</HI> above <HI>s</HI> the value of the &s;eries, but <HI>a</HI> nearer than o to the value <HI>s,</HI> it follows that <HI>s</HI> lies between <HI>a</HI> and &frac12;<HI>a,</HI> and that &frac12;<HI>a</HI> is le&s;s than <HI>s,</HI> and &s;o nearer to <HI>s</HI> than o is. In like manner, be|cau&s;e <HI>a</HI> is above, and <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> below the value <HI>s,</HI> but <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> nearer to that value than <HI>a</HI> is, it follows that <HI>s</HI> lies between <HI>a</HI> and <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b,</HI> and that the arithmetical mean <HI>a</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>b</HI> is &s;omething above the value of <HI>s,</HI> but nearer to that value than <HI>a</HI> is. And thus, the &s;ame rea&s;oning holding in every following pair of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, the arithmetical means between them will form another &s;eries of terms, which are, like tho&s;e &s;ums, alternately le&s;s and greater than the value of the pro|po&s;ed &s;eries, but approximating nearer to that value than the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums do, as every term of tho&s;e means is nearer to the value <HI>s</HI> than the corre&s;ponding preceding term in the &s;ums is. And like as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums form a progre&s;&s;ion approaching always nearer and nearer to the value of the &s;eries, &s;o in like manner their arithmetical means form another progre&s;&s;ion coming nearer and nearer to the &s;ame value, and each term of the progre&s;&s;ion of means nearer than each term of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums. Hence then we have the two following
<PB N="16" REF="21">&s;eries, namely, of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums and their arithmetical means, in which each &s;tep approaches nearer to the value of <HI>s</HI> than the former, the latter progre&s;&s;ion being however nearer than the former, and the terms or &s;teps of each alternately below and above the value <HI>s</HI> of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c.

Al&s;o every line, formed of all the fir&s;t terms, all the &s;econd terms, all the third terms, &amp;c. of the columns, forms al&s;o a progre&s;&s;ion who&s;e terms continually approximate to the value of <HI>s,</HI> and each line nearer or quicker than the former; but differing from the columns, or vertical progre&s;&s;ions, in this, namely, that whereas the terms in the columns are alternately below and above the value of <HI>s,</HI> tho&s;e in each line are all on one &s;ide of the value <HI>s,</HI> namely, either all below or all above it; and the lines alternately too little and too great, namely all the expre&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t line too little, all tho&s;e in the &s;econd line too great, tho&s;e in the third line too little, and &s;o on, every odd line being too little, and every even line too great.</P>
<P N="7">7.

But we can ea&s;ily expre&s;s all the&s;e &s;everal theorems by one general formula. For, &s;ince it is evident by the con&s;truction, that whil&s;t the denominator in any one of them is &s;ome power (2^n) of 2 or 1 &plus; 1, the numeral coefficients
<PB N="18" REF="23">of <HI>a, b, c,</HI> &amp;c. the terms in the numerator, are found by &s;ubtracting all the terms except the la&s;t term, one after another, from the &s;aid power 2^n or <GAP DESC="math"> which is &equals; 1 &plus; <HI>n</HI> &plus; <HI>n</HI> &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 &plus; <HI>n</HI> &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;2/3 &plus; &amp;c. namely the coefficient of <HI>a</HI> equal to all the terms 2^n minus the fir&s;t term 1; that of <HI>b</HI> equal to all except the fir&s;t two terms 1 &plus; <HI>n;</HI> that of <HI>c</HI> equal to all except the fir&s;t three; and &s;o on, till the coeffi|cient of the la&s;t term be &equals; 1 the la&s;t term of the power; it follows that the general expre&s;&s;ion for the &s;everal theorems, or the general ap|proximate value of the converging &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. will be <GAP DESC="math"> continued till the terms vani&s;h and the &s;eries break off, <HI>n</HI> being equal to o or any integer number. Or this general formula may be expre&s;&s;ed by this &s;eries, <GAP DESC="math"> where A, B, C, &amp;c. denote the coefficients of the &s;everal preceding terms. And this expre&s;&s;ion, which is always too little, is the nearer to the true value of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. as the number <HI>n</HI> is taken greater: always excepting however tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the theorem is accurately true when <HI>n</HI> is &s;ome certain finite number. Al&s;o, with any value of <HI>n,</HI> the formula is nearer to the truth, as the terms <HI>a, b, c,</HI> &amp;c. of the propo&s;ed &s;eries, are nearer to equality; &s;o that the &s;lower the propo&s;ed &s;eries converges, the more accurate is the formula, and the &s;ooner does it afford a near value of that &s;eries: which is a very fa|vourable circum&s;tance, as it is in ca&s;es of very &s;low convergency that approximating formulae are chiefly wanted. And, like as the formula approaches nearer to the truth as the terms of the &s;eries approach to an equality, &s;o when the terms become quite equal, as in a neutral &s;eries, the formula becomes quite accurate, and always gives the &s;ame value &frac12;<HI>a</HI> for <HI>s</HI> or the &s;eries, whatever integer number be taken for <HI>n.</HI> And farther, when the propo&s;ed &s;eries, from being converging, pa&s;&s;es through
<PB N="19" REF="24">neutrality, when its terms are equal, and becomes diverging, the for|mula will &s;till hold good, only it will then be alternately too great, and too little as long as the &s;eries diverges, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew more fully. So that in general the value <HI>s</HI> of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. whether it be converging, diverging, or neutral, is le&s;s than the fir&s;t term <HI>a;</HI> when the &s;eries converges, the value is above &frac12;<HI>a;</HI> when it diverges, it is below &frac12;<HI>a;</HI> and when neutral, it is equal to &frac12;<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Take now the &s;eries of the fir&s;t terms of the &s;everal orders of arithmetical means, which form the progre&s;&s;ion of continual approxi|mating formulae, being each nearer to the value of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. than the former, and place them in a column one under another; then take the differences between every two adjacent formulae, and place in another column by the &s;ide of the former, as here below:

</TABLE> From which it appears, that this &s;eries of differences con&s;i&s;ts of the very &s;ame quantities, which form the fir&s;t terms of all the orders of differ|ences of the terms of the propo&s;ed &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. when taken as u&s;ual in the differential method. And becau&s;e the fir&s;t of the above differences added to the fir&s;t formula, gives the &s;econd formula; and the &s;econd difference added to the &s;econd formula, gives the third formula; and &s;o on; therefore the fir&s;t formula with all the differences added, will give the la&s;t formula; con&s;equently our general formula <GAP DESC="math">
<PB N="20" REF="25">which approaches to the value of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. is al&s;o equivalent to, or reduces to this form, <GAP DESC="math"> which, it is evident, agrees with the famous differential &s;eries. And this coincidence might be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of our method, though we had not given other more direct proof of it. Hence it ap|pears then, that our theorem is of the &s;ame degree of accuracy, or convergency, as the differential theorem; but admits of more direct and ea&s;y application, as the terms them&s;elves are u&s;ed, without the pre|vious trouble of taking the &s;everal orders of differences. And our method will be rendered general for literal as well as numeral &s;eries, by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>a, b, c,</HI> &amp;c. to repre&s;ent, not barely the coefficients of the terms, but the whole terms, both the numeral and the literal part of them. However, as the chief u&s;e of my method is to obtain the nu|meral value of &s;eries, when a literal &s;eries is to be &s;o &s;ummed, it is to be made numeral by &s;ub&s;tituting the numeral values of the letters in|&s;tead of them. It is farther evident, that we might ea&s;ily derive our method of arithmetical means from the above differential &s;eries, by beginning with it, and receding back to our theorems, by a counter proce&s;s to that above given.</P>
<P N="9">9. Having, in Art. 5, 6, 7, 8, compleated the inve&s;tigations for the fir&s;t or converging form of &s;eries, the fir&s;t four articles being introduc|tory to both forms in common; we may now proceed to the diverging form of &s;eries, for which we &s;hall find the &s;ame method of arithmetical means, and the &s;ame general formula, as for the converging &s;eries; as well as the mode of inve&s;tigation u&s;ed in Art. 5 <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> only changing &s;ometimes greater for le&s;s, or le&s;s for greater. Thus then, rea&s;oning from the table of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums in Art. 3, in which <HI>s</HI> is alternately above and below the expre&s;&s;ions o, <HI>a, a</HI> &minus; <HI>b, a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c,</HI> &amp;c. be|cau&s;e o is below, and <HI>a</HI> above the value <HI>s</HI> of the &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c</HI> &minus; <HI>d</HI> &plus; &amp;c. but o nearer than <HI>a</HI> to that value, it follows that <HI>s</HI> lies be|tween
<PB N="21" REF="26">o and &frac12;<HI>a,</HI> and that &frac12;<HI>a</HI> is greater than <HI>s,</HI> but nearer to <HI>s</HI> than <HI>a</HI> is. In like manner, becau&s;e <HI>a</HI> is above, and <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> below the value <HI>s,</HI> but <HI>a</HI> nearer to that value than <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> is, it follows that <HI>s</HI> lies between <HI>a</HI> and <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b,</HI> and that the arithmetical mean <HI>a</HI> &minus; &frac12;<HI>b</HI> is below <HI>s,</HI> but that it is nearer to <HI>s</HI> than <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>b</HI> is. And thus, the &s;ame rea&s;oning holding in every pair of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, the arithmetical means between them will form another &s;eries of terms, which are alternately greater and le&s;s than <HI>s</HI> the value of the propo&s;ed &s;eries; but here greater and le&s;s in the con|trary way to what they were for the converging &s;eries, namely, tho&s;e &s;teps greater here which were le&s;s there, and le&s;s here which before were greater. And this fir&s;t &s;et of arithmetical means, will either con|verge to the value of <HI>s,</HI> or will at lea&s;t diverge le&s;s from it than the progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums. Again, the &s;ame rea&s;oning &s;till hold|ing good, by taking the arithmetical means of tho&s;e fir&s;t means, another &s;et is found, which will either converge, or el&s;e diverge le&s;s than the former. And &s;o on as far as we plea&s;e, every new operation gradually checking the fir&s;t or greate&s;t divergency, till a number of the fir&s;t terms of a &s;et converge &s;ufficiently fa&s;t, to afford a near value of <HI>s</HI> the pro|po&s;ed &s;eries.</P>
<P N="10">10. Or, by taking the fir&s;t terms of all the orders of means, we find the &s;ame &s;et of theorems, namely <GAP DESC="math">, &amp;c. or in general, <GAP DESC="math"> which will be alternately above and below <HI>s</HI> the value of the &s;eries, till the divergency is overcome. Then this &s;eries, which con&s;i&s;ts of the fir&s;t terms of the &s;everal orders of means, may be treated as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, taking &s;everal orders of means of the&s;e again. After which the fir&s;t terms of the&s;e la&s;t orders may be treated again in the &s;ame manner; and &s;o on as far as we plea&s;e. Or the &s;eries of &s;econd terms, or third terms, &amp;c. or &s;ometimes, the terms a&s;cending ob|liquely, may be treated in the &s;ame manner to advantage. And
<PB N="22" REF="27">with a little practice and in&s;pection of the &s;everal &s;eries, whether vertical, or horizontal, or oblique, (for they all tend to the detection of the &s;ame value <HI>s</HI>) we &s;hall &s;oon learn to di&s;tingui&s;h whereabouts the required quantity <HI>s</HI> is, and which of the &s;eries will &s;oone&s;t approxi|mate to it.</P>
<P N="11">11. To exemplify now this method, we &s;hall take a few &s;eries of both &s;orts, and find their value &s;ometimes by actually going through the operations of taking the &s;everal orders of arithmetical means, and at other times by u&s;ing &s;ome one of the theorems <GAP DESC="math">, &amp;c. at once. And to render the u&s;e of the&s;e theorems &s;till ea&s;ier, we &s;hall here &s;ub|join the following table, where the fir&s;t line con&s;i&s;ting of the powers of 2, contains the denominators of the theorems in their order, and the figures in their perpendicular columns below them, are the coefficients of the &s;everal terms in the numerators of the theorems, namely, the upper figure, next below the power of 2, the coefficient of <HI>a;</HI> the next below, that of <HI>b;</HI> the third that of <HI>c,</HI> &amp;c.

</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28">The con&s;truction and continuation of this table, is a bu&s;ine&s;s of little labour. For the numbers in the fir&s;t horizontal line next below the line of the powers of 2, are tho&s;e powers dimini&s;hed each by unity. The numbers in the next horizontal line, are made from the numbers in the fir&s;t, by &s;ubtracting from each the index of that power of 2 which &s;tands above it. And for the re&s;t of the table, the formation of it is obvious from this principle, which reigns through the whole, that every number in it is the &s;um of two others, namely of the next to it on the left in the &s;ame horizontal line, and the next above that in the &s;ame vertical column. So that the whole table is formed from a few of its initial numbers, by ea&s;y operations of addition.</P>
<P>In converging &s;eries, it will be farther u&s;eful, fir&s;t to collect a few of the initial terms into one &s;um, and then apply our method to the fol|lowing terms, which will be &s;ooner valued becau&s;e they will converge &s;lower.</P>
<P N="12">12. For the fir&s;t example, let us take the very &s;lowly converging &s;eries 1 &minus; &frac12; &plus; &frac13; &minus; &frac14; &plus; &frac15; &minus; &frac16; &plus; &amp;c. which is known to expre&s;s the hyp. log. of 2, which is &equals; .69314718.</P>
<P>Here <HI>a</HI> &equals; 1, <HI>b</HI> &equals; &frac12;, <HI>c</HI> &equals; &frac13;, <HI>d</HI> &equals; &frac14;, &amp;c. and the value, as found by theorem the 1&s;t, 2d, 3d, 4th, 10th, and 20th, will be thus:

Where it is evident that every theorem gives always a nearer value than the former: the 10th theorem gives the value true to the 4th
<PB N="24" REF="29">figure, and the 20th theorem to the 8th figure. The operation for the 10th and 20th theorems, will be ea&s;ily performed by dividing, mentally, the numbers in their re&s;pective columns in the table of coefficients in Art. 11, by the ordinate numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. placing the quotients of the alternate terms below each other, then adding each up, and dividing the difference of the &s;ums continually five or ten times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the number 4: after the manner as here placed below, where the operation is &s;et down for both of them.</P>
<P>1. For the 10th Theorem. <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>2. For the 20th Theorem. <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Again, to perform the operation by taking the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, and the arithmetical means: let the terms &frac12;, &frac13;, &frac14;, &amp;c. be reduced to decimal numbers, by dividing the common numerator 1 by the deno|minators 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. or rather by taking the&s;e out of the table at the end of my <HI>Mi&s;cellanea Mathematica,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1775, which con|tains a table of the &s;quare roots and reciprocals of all the numbers,
<PB N="25" REF="30">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. to 1000, and which is of great u&s;e in &s;uch calculations as the&s;e. Then the operation will &s;tand thus: <GAP DESC="math"> Here, after collecting the fir&s;t twelve terms, I begin at the bottom, and, a&s;cending upwards, take a very few arithmetical means between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, placing them on the right of them: it being unne|ce&s;&s;ary to take the means of the whole, as any part of them will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, but the lower ones in a converging &s;eries be&s;t, becau&s;e they are nearer the value &s;ought, and approach &s;ooner to it. I then take the means of the fir&s;t means, and the means of the&s;e again, and &s;o on, till the value is obtained as near as may be nece&s;&s;ary. In this proce&s;s we &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h whereabouts the value lies, the limits or means, which are alternately above and below it, gradually contracting, and approaching towards each other. And when the means are reduced to a &s;ingle one, and it is found nece&s;&s;ary to get the value more exactly, I then go back to the columns of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, and find another fir&s;t mean, either next below or above tho&s;e before found, and continue it through the 2d, 3d, &amp;c. means, which makes now a duplicate in the la&s;t column of means, and the mean between them gives another &s;ingle mean of the next order; and &s;o on as far as we &s;ee it nece&s;&s;ary. By &s;uch a gradual progre&s;s we u&s;e no more terms nor labour than is quite requi&s;ite for the degree of accuracy required.</P>
<P>Or, after having collected the &s;um of any number of terms, we may apply any of the formulae to the following terms. So, having as above
<PB N="26" REF="31">found .653211 for the &s;um of the fir&s;t 12 terms, and calling the next or 13th term .076923 &equals; <HI>a,</HI> the 14th term .0714285 &equals; <HI>b,</HI> the next, .06666 &amp;c. &equals; <HI>c,</HI> and &s;o on: then the 2d theorem 3<HI>a</HI>&minus;<HI>b</HI>/4 gives .039835, which added to .653211 the &s;um of the fir&s;t 12 terms, gives .693046, the value of the &s;eries true in three places of figures; and the 3d theorem <GAP DESC="math"> gives .039927 for the following terms, and which added to .653211 the &s;um of the fir&s;t 12 terms, gives .693138, the value of the &s;eries true in five places. And &s;o on.</P>
<P N="13">13. For a &s;econd example, let us take the &s;lowly converging &s;eries 2/1 &minus; 3/2 &plus; 4/3 &minus; 5/4 &plus; 6/5 &minus; 7/6 &plus; &amp;c. which is &equals; &frac12; &plus; hyp. log. of 2 &equals; 1.19314718. Then <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Here, after the 3d column of means, the fir&s;t four figures 1.193, which are common, are omitted, to &s;ave room and the trouble of writing them &s;o often down; and in the la&s;t three columns, the proce&s;s is repeated with the la&s;t three figures of each number; and the la&s;t of the&s;e 147, joined to the fir&s;t four, give 1.193147 for the value of the &s;eries propo&s;ed. And the &s;ame value is al&s;o obtained by the theorems u&s;ed as in the former example.</P>
<P N="14">14. For the third example let us take the converging &s;eries 1 &minus; &frac13; &plus; &frac15; &minus; 1/7 &plus; 1/9 &minus; 1/11 &plus; &amp;c. which is &equals; .7853981 &amp;c. or &frac14; of the circumference of the circle who&s;e diameter is 1. Here <HI>a</HI> &equals; 1, <HI>b</HI> &equals; &frac13;,
<PB N="27" REF="32"><HI>c</HI> &equals; &frac15;, &amp;c. then turning the terms into decimals, and proceeding with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums and means as before, we obtain the 5th mean true within a unit in the 6th place as here below: <GAP DESC="math"></P>

<P><GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P N="16">16. To find the value of 1 &minus; &frac14; &plus; &frac12; &minus; 1/16 &plus; 1/25 &minus; &amp;c. con|&s;i&s;ting of the reciprocals of the natural &s;eries of &s;quare numbers.
<PB N="28" REF="33">
<GAP DESC="math"> The la&s;t mean .822467 is true in the la&s;t figure, the more accurate value of the &s;eries 1 &minus; &frac14; &plus; 1/9 &minus; 1/16 &plus; &amp;c. being .8224670 &amp;c.</P>
<P N="17">17. Let the diverging &s;eries &frac12; &minus; &frac23; &plus; &frac34; &minus; &frac45; &plus; &amp;c. be propo&s;ed; where the terms are the reciprocals of tho&s;e in Art. 13.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Here the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums are alternately &plus; and &minus;, as well as the terms them&s;elves of the propo&s;ed &s;eries, but all the arithmetical means are po&s;itive. The numbers in each column of means are alter|nately too great and too little, but &s;o as vi&s;ibly to approach towards each other. The &s;ame mutual approximation is vi&s;ible in all the oblique lines from left to right, &s;o that there is a general and mutual tendency, in all the columns, and in all the lines, to the limit of the value of the &s;eries. But with this difference, that all the numbers in any line de|&s;cending obliquely from left to right, are on one &s;ide of the limit, and
<PB N="29" REF="34">tho&s;e in the next line in the &s;ame direction, all on the other &s;ide, the one line having its numbers all too great, while tho&s;e in the next line are all too little; but, on the contrary, the lines which a&s;cend from below obliquely towards the right, have their numbers alternately too great and too little, after the manner of tho&s;e in the columns, but ap|proximating quicker than tho&s;e in the columns. So that, after having continued the columns of arithmetical means to any convenient extent, we may then &s;elect the terms in the la&s;t, or any other line obliquely a&s;cending from left to right, or rather beginning with the la&s;t found mean on the right, and de&s;cending towards the left; then arrange tho&s;e terms below one another in a column, and take their continual arithme|tical means, like as was done with the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, to &s;uch extent as the ca&s;e may require. And if neither the&s;e new columns, nor the oblique lines approach near enough to each other, a new &s;et may be formed from one of their oblique lines which has its terms alternately too great and too little. And thus we may proceed as far as we plea&s;e. The&s;e repetitions will be more nece&s;&s;ary in treating &s;eries which diverge more; and having here once for all de&s;cribed the properties attending the &s;eries, with the method of repetition, we &s;hall only have to refer to them as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the la&s;t two or three means vary or differ &s;o little, that the limit may be concluded to lie nearly in the middle between them, and therefore the mean between the two la&s;t 144 and 150, namely 147, may be concluded to be very near the truth, in the la&s;t three figures; for as to the fir&s;t three figures 193, I dropt the repetition of them after the fir&s;t three columns of means, both to &s;ave &s;pace, and the trouble of writing them &s;o often over again. So that the value of the &s;eries in que&s;tion may be concluded to be .193147 very nearly, which is &equals; &minus; &frac12; &plus; the hyp. log. of 2; or 1 le&s;s than its reciprocal &s;eries in Art. 13.</P>

<P>Now, ranging the terms in a column, and taking the &s;ums and means as u&s;ual, we have <GAP DESC="math"> Where it is evident, that the diverging is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed, but not quite counteracted, in the columns and oblique de&s;cending lines from beginning to end, as the terms in tho&s;e directions &s;till increa&s;e, though not quite &s;o fa&s;t as the original &s;eries; and that the &s;igns of the &s;ame terms are alternately &plus; and &minus;, while tho&s;e of the terms in the other lines obliquely a&s;cending from left to right, are alternately one line all &plus;, and another line all &minus;, and the&s;e terms continually decrea&s;ing. The terms in the oblique de&s;cending lines, being alternately too great and too little, are the fitte&s;t to proceed with again. Take therefore any one of tho&s;e lines, as &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t, and ranging it vertically, take the means as before, and they will approach nearer to the value of the &s;eries, thus:
<PB N="35" REF="40">
<GAP DESC="math"> Here the &s;ame approximation in the lines and columns, towards the value of the &s;eries, is ob&s;ervable again, only in a higher degree; al&s;o the terms in the columns and oblique de&s;cending lines, are again alter|nately too great and too little, but now within narrower limits, and the &s;igns of the terms are more of them po&s;itive; al&s;o the terms in each oblique a&s;cending line, are &s;till either all above or all below the value of the &s;eries, and that alternately one line after another as before. But the de&s;cending lines will again be the fitte&s;t to u&s;e, becau&s;e the terms in each are alternately above and below the value &s;ought. Tak|ing therefore again the fir&s;t of the&s;e oblique de&s;cending lines, treat it as before, and we &s;hall obtain &s;ets of terms approaching &s;till nearer to the value, thus: <GAP DESC="math"> Here the approach to an equality, among all the lines and columns, is &s;till more vi&s;ible, and the deviations re&s;tricted within narrower limits, the terms in the oblique a&s;cending lines &s;till on one &s;ide of the value, and gradually increa&s;ing, while the columns and the oblique de&s;cending lines, for the mo&s;t part, have their terms alternately too great and too little, as is evident from their alternately becoming greater and le&s;s than each other: and from an in&s;pection of the whole, it is ea&s;y to pronounce that the fir&s;t three figures of the number &s;ought, will be 298. Taking therefore the la&s;t &s;our terms of the fir&s;t de&s;cending line, and proceeding as before, we have
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>And, finally, taking the lowe&s;t a&s;cending line, becau&s;e it has mo&s;t the appearance of being alternately too great and too little, proceed with it as before, thus: <GAP DESC="math"> where the numbers in the lines and columns gradually approach nearer together, till the la&s;t mean is true to the neare&s;t unit in the la&s;t figure, giving us .298174 for the value of the propo&s;ed hypergeometrical &s;eries 1 &minus; 3 &plus; 12 &minus; 60 &plus; 360 &minus; 2520 &plus; 20160 &minus; &amp;c.</P>
<P>And in like manner are we to proceed with any other &s;eries who&s;e terms have alternate &s;igns.</P>

<P>SINCE the foregoing method was di&s;covered, and made known to &s;everal friends, two pa&s;&s;ages have been offered to my con&s;ideration, which I &s;hall here mention, in ju&s;tice to their authors, Sir I&s;aac New|ton, and the late learned Mr. Euler.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is in Sir I&s;aac's letter to Mr. Oldenburg, dated <HI>October</HI> 24, 1676, and may be &s;een in Collins's <HI>Commercium Epi&s;tolicum,</HI> p. 177, the la&s;t paragraph near the bottom of the page, namely, <HI>Per

And this, indeed, is equivalent to taking one arithmetical mean between two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ums, but it does not reach the idea contained in my method. It appears al&s;o, both by the other words, <HI>&amp; alia quaedam &s;imilia artificia adhibeantur,</HI> contained in the above extract, and by the&s;e, <HI>alias artes adhibui&s;&s;em,</HI> a little higher up in the &s;ame page 177, that Sir I&s;aac Newton had &s;everal other contrivances for obtaining the &s;ums of &s;lowly converging &s;eries; but what they were, it may perhaps be now impo&s;&s;i|ble to determine.</P>
<P>The other is a pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Novi Comment. Petropol.</HI> tom. v. p. 226, where Mr. Euler gives an in&s;tance of taking one &s;et of arithmetical means between a &s;eries of quantities which are gradually too little and too great, to obtain a nearer value of the &s;um of a &s;eries in que&s;tion. But neither does this reach the idea contained in my method. How|ever, I have thought it but ju&s;tice to the characters of the&s;e two eminent men, to make this mention of their ideas, which have &s;ome relation to my own, though unknown to me at the time of my di&s;covery.</P>

<P>Art. 1. WHEN we have occa&s;ion to find the &s;um of &s;uch &s;eries as that above-mentioned, having the coefficients <HI>a, b, c, d,</HI> &amp;c. of the terms, decrea&s;ing very &s;lowly, and the con|verging quantity <HI>x</HI> pretty large; we can neither find the &s;um by col|lecting the terms together, on account of the immen&s;e number of them which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to collect; neither can it be &s;ummed by means of the differential &s;eries, becau&s;e the powers of the quantity <HI>x</HI>/1&minus;<HI>x</HI> will then diverge fa&s;ter than the differential coefficients converge. In &s;uch ca&s;e then we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;ome other method of tran&s;|forming it into another &s;eries which &s;hall converge fa&s;ter. The follow|ing is a method by which the propo&s;ed &s;eries is changed into another, which converges &s;o much the quicker as the original &s;eries is &s;lower.</P>
<P N="2">2. The method is thus. A&s;&s;ume <HI>a</HI>^2/D the given &s;eries <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>bx</HI> &plus; <HI>cx</HI>^2 &plus; <HI>dx</HI>^3 &plus; &amp;c. Then &s;hall <GAP DESC="math">; which, by actual divi&s;ion, is <GAP DESC="math"> Con&s;equently <HI>a</HI>^2 divided by this &s;eries will be equal to the &s;eries propo&s;ed, and this new &s;eries will be very ea&s;ily &s;ummed, in com|pari&s;on with the original one, becau&s;e all the coefficients after the &s;econd term are evidently very &s;mall; and indeed they are &s;o much the &s;maller, and fitter for &s;ummation, by how much the coefficients of the
<PB N="39" REF="44">original &s;eries are nearer to equality; &s;o that when the&s;e <HI>a, b, c, d,</HI> &amp;c. are quite equal, then the third, fourth, &amp;c. coefficients of the new &s;eries become equal to nothing, and the &s;um accurately equal to <GAP DESC="math">; which we al&s;o know to be true from other principles.</P>
<P N="3">3. Although the fir&s;t two terms, <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>bx,</HI> of the new &s;eries be very great in compari&s;on with each of the following terms, yet the&s;e latter may not always be &s;mall enough to be entirely rejected where much accuracy is required in the &s;ummation. And in &s;uch ca&s;e it will be nece&s;&s;ary to collect a great number of them, to obtain their &s;um pretty near the truth; becau&s;e their rate of converging is but &s;mall, it being indeed pretty much like to the rate of the original &s;eries, but only the terms, each to each, are much &s;maller, and that commonly in a degree to the hundredth or thou&s;andth part.</P>
<P N="4">4. The re&s;emblance of this new &s;eries however, beginning with the third term, to the original one, in the law of progre&s;&s;ion, intimates to us that it will be be&s;t to &s;um it in the very &s;ame manner as the former. Hence then putting

<P N="5">5. But if the&s;e la&s;t terms be &s;till thought too large to be omitted, then find the &s;um of them by the very &s;ame theorem: and thus proceed, by repeating the operation in the &s;ame manner, till the required degree of accuracy is obtained.

<HEAD>TRACT IV. <HI>The Inve&s;tigation of certain ea&s;y and General Rules, for Extracting any Root of a given Number.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE roots of given numbers are commonly to be found, with much ea&s;e and expedition, by means of logarithms, when the indices of &s;uch roots are &s;imple numbers, and the roots are not required to a great number of figures. And the &s;quare or cubic roots of numbers, to a good practical degree of accuracy, may be ob|tained, almo&s;t by in&s;pection, by means of my tables of &s;quares and cubes, publi&s;hed by order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Longitude, in the year 1781. But when the indices of &s;uch roots are certain complex or irrational numbers, or when the roots are required to be found to a great many places of figures, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of certain ap|proximating rules, by means of the ordinary arithmetical computa|tions. Such rules as are here alluded to, have only been di&s;covered &s;ince the great improvements in the modern algebra: and the per&s;ons who have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in their enquiries after &s;uch rules, have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Sir I&s;aac Newton, Mr. Raph&s;on, M. de Lagney, and Dr. Halley; who have &s;hewn that the inve&s;tigation of &s;uch theorems is al&s;o u&s;eful in di&s;covering rules for approximating to the roots of all &s;orts of affected algebraical equations, to which the former rules, for the roots of all &s;imple equations, bear a con&s;iderable affinity. It is pre&s;umed that the following &s;hort tract contains &s;ome advantages over any other method that has hitherto been given, both as to the ea&s;e and univer&s;ality of the conclu&s;ions, and the general way in which the inve&s;tigations are made: for here, a theorem is di&s;covered, which, although it be general for all roots whatever, is at the &s;ame time very accurate, and &s;o &s;imple and

<HEAD>TRACT V. <HI>A new Method of finding, in finite and general Terms, near Values of the Roots of Equations of this Form, <GAP DESC="math">; namely, having the Terms alternately Plus and Minus.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE following is one method more, to be added to the many we are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, for determining the roots of the higher equations. By means of it we readily find a root, which is &s;ometimes accurate; and when not &s;o, it is at lea&s;t near the truth, and that by an ea&s;y finite formula, which is general for all equations of the above form, and of the &s;ame dimen&s;ion, provided that root be a real one. This is of u&s;e for depre&s;&s;ing the equation down to lower dimen|&s;ions, and thence for finding all the roots one after another, when the formula gives the root &s;ufficiently exact; and when not, it &s;erves as a ready means of obtaining a near value of a root, by which to com|mence an approximation &s;till nearer, by the previou&s;ly known methods of Newton, or Halley, or others. This method is farther u&s;eful in elucidating the nature of equations, and certain properties of numbers; as will appear in &s;ome of the following articles. We have already ea&s;y methods for finding the roots of &s;imple and quadratic equations. I &s;hall therefore begin with the cubic equation, and treat of each order of equations &s;eparately, in a&s;cending gradually to the higher dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let then the cubic equation <HI>x</HI>^3 &minus; <HI>px</HI>^2 &plus; <HI>qx</HI> &minus; <HI>r</HI> &equals; o be pro|po&s;ed. A&s;&s;ume the root <HI>x</HI> &equals; <HI>a,</HI> either accurately or approximately, as it may happen, &s;o that <HI>x</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &equals; o, accurately or nearly. Rai&s;e this
<PB N="55" REF="60"><HI>x</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI> &equals; o to the third power, the &s;ame dimen&s;ion with the propo&s;ed equation, &s;o &s;hall <HI>x</HI>^3 &minus; 3 <HI>a x</HI>^2 &plus; 3 <HI>a</HI>^2 <HI>x</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI>^3 &equals; o; but the propo&s;ed equation is <HI>x</HI>^3 &minus; <HI>p x</HI>^2 &plus; <HI>q x</HI> &minus; <HI>r</HI> &equals; o; therefore the one of the&s;e is equal to the other. But the fir&s;t term (<HI>x</HI>^3) of each is the &s;ame; and hence, if we a&s;&s;ume the &s;econd terms equal between them&s;elves, it will follow that the &s;um of the two remain|ing terms will al&s;o be equal, and give a &s;imple equation by which the value of <HI>x</HI> is determined. Thus, 3<HI>a x</HI>^2 being &equals; <HI>px</HI>^2, or <HI>a</HI> &equals; &frac13;<HI>p,</HI> we &s;hall have 3<HI>a</HI>^2<HI>x</HI> &minus; <HI>a</HI>^3 &equals; <HI>qx</HI> &minus; <HI>r,</HI> and hence <GAP DESC="math">, by &s;ub&s;tituting &frac13;<HI>p,</HI> the value of <HI>a,</HI> in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now this value of <HI>x</HI> here found, will be the middle root of the propo&s;ed cubic equation. For becau&s;e <HI>a</HI> is a&s;&s;umed nearly or accu|rately equal to <HI>x,</HI> and al&s;o equal to &frac13; <HI>p,</HI> therefore <HI>x</HI> is &equals; &frac13; <HI>p</HI> nearly or accurately, that is, &frac13; of the &s;um of the three roots, to which the coefficient <HI>p</HI> of the &s;econd term of the equation, is always equal; and thus, being a medium among the three roots, it will be either nearly or accurately equal to the middle root of the propo&s;ed equation, when that root is a real one.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now this value of <HI>x</HI> will always be the middle root <HI>accurately,</HI> whenever the three roots are in arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion; otherwi&s;e, only <HI>approximately.</HI> For when the three roots are in arithmetical progre&s;|&s;ion, &frac13; <HI>p</HI> or &frac13; of their &s;um, it is well known, is equal to the middle term or root. In the other ca&s;es, therefore, the above-found value of <HI>x</HI> is only <HI>near</HI> the middle root.</P>

For, in any equation, the coefficient <HI>p</HI> of the &s;econd term, is the &s;um of the roots; the coefficient <HI>q</HI> of the third term, is the &s;um of the rectangles of the roots; and the coefficient <HI>r</HI> of the fourth term, is the &s;um of the &s;olids of the roots, which in the ca&s;e of the cubic equation is only one:&mdash;Thus, if the roots, or arithmetical terms, be 1, 2, 3.

<HEAD>TRACT VI. <HI>Of the Binomial Theorem. With a Demon&s;tration of the Truth of it in the General Ca&s;e of Fractional Exponents.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is well known that this famous theorem is called <HI>binomial,</HI> becau&s;e it contains a propo&s;ition of a quantity con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>two</HI> terms, as a radix, to be expanded in a &s;eries of equal value. It is al&s;o called emphatically the Newtonian theorem, or Newton's binomial theorem, becau&s;e he has commonly been reputed the author of it, as he was indeed for the ca&s;e of fractional exponents, which is the mo&s;t general of all, and includes all the other particular ca&s;es, of powers, or divi&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. The binomial, as propo&s;ed in its general form, was, by Newton, thus expre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="math">; where P is the fir&s;t term of the binomial, Q the quotient of the &s;econd term divided by the fir&s;t, and con&s;e|quently PQ is the &s;econd term it&s;elf; or PQ may repre&s;ent all the terms of a multinomial, after the fir&s;t term, and con&s;equently Q the quotient of all tho&s;e terms, except the fir&s;t term, divided by that fir&s;t term, and may be either po&s;itive or negative; al&s;o <HI>m</HI>/<HI>n</HI> repre&s;ents the exponent of the binomial, and may denote any quantity, integral or fractional, po&s;itive or negative, rational or &s;urd. When the exponent
<PB N="66" REF="71">is integral, the denominator <HI>n</HI> is equal to 1, and the quantity then in this form <GAP DESC="math">, denotes a binomial to be rai&s;ed to &s;ome power; the &s;eries for which was fully determined before Newton's time, as I have &s;hewn in the hi&s;torical introduction to my Mathematical Tables, lately publi&s;hed. When the exponent is fractional, <HI>m</HI> and <HI>n</HI> may be any quantities whatever, <HI>m</HI> denoting the index of &s;ome power to which the binomial is to be rai&s;ed, and <HI>n</HI> the index of the root to be extracted of that power: and to this ca&s;e it was fir&s;t extended and applied by Newton. When the exponent is negative, the reciprocal of the &s;ame quantity is meant; as <GAP DESC="math"> is equal to <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. The truth of this &s;eries was not demon&s;trated by Newton, but only inferred by way of induction. Since his time however, &s;everal attempts have been made to demon&s;trate it, with various &s;ucce&s;s, and in various ways; of which however tho&s;e are ju&s;tly preferred, which proceed by pure algebra, and without the help of fluxions. And &s;uch has been e&s;teemed the difficulty of proving the general ca&s;e independent of the doctrine of fluxions, that many eminent mathematicians to this day account the demon&s;tration not fully accompli&s;hed, and &s;till a thing greatly to be de&s;ired. Such a demon&s;tration I think I have effected. But before I deliver it, it may not be improper to premi&s;e &s;omewhat of the hi&s;tory of this theorem, its ri&s;e, progre&s;s, exten&s;ion, and demon|&s;trations.</P>
<P N="5">5. Till very lately the prevailing opinion has been, that the theorem was not only invented by Newton, but fir&s;t of all by him; that is, in that &s;tate of perfection in which the terms of the &s;eries for any a&s;&s;igned power whatever, can be found independently of the terms of the pre|ceding powers; namely, the &s;econd term from the fir&s;t, the third term from the &s;econd, the fourth term from the third, and &s;o on, by a gene|ral rule. Upon this point I have already given an opinion in the hi&s;tory to my logarithms, above cited, and I &s;hall here enlarge &s;ome|what farther on the &s;ame head.</P>
<P>That Newton invented it him&s;elf, I make no doubt. But that he was not the fir&s;t inventor, is at lea&s;t as certain. It was de&s;cribed by Briggs, in his Trigonometria Britannica, long before Newton was born; not indeed for fractional exponents, for that was the application of Newton, but for any integral power whatever, and that by the general law of the terms as laid down by Newton, independent of the terms of the powers preceding that which is required. For as to the generation of the coefficients of the terms of one power from tho&s;e of
<PB N="68" REF="73">the preceding powers, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one after another, it was remarked by Vieta, Oughtred, and many others, and was not unknown to much more early writers on arithmetic and algebra, as will be manife&s;t by a &s;light in&s;pection of their works, as well as the gradual advance the pro|perty made, both in extent and per&s;picuity, under the hands of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ma&s;ters in arithmetic, every one adding &s;omewhat more towards the perfection of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Now the knowledge of this property of the coefficients of the terms in the powers of a binomial, is at lea&s;t as old as the practice of the ex|traction of roots; for this property was both the foundation, the prin|ciple, and the means of tho&s;e extractions. And as the writers on arith|metic became acquainted with the nature of the coefficients in powers &s;till higher, ju&s;t &s;o much higher did they extend the extraction of roots, &s;till making u&s;e of this property. At fir&s;t it &s;eems they were only ac|quainted with the nature of the &s;quare, which con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e three terms, 1, 2, 1; and accordingly extracted the &s;quare roots of numbers by means of them; but went no farther. The nature of the cube next pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e four terms, 1, 3, 3, 1; and by means of the&s;e they extracted the cubic roots of numbers, in the &s;ame manner as we do at pre&s;ent. And this was the extent of their extrac|tions in the time of Lucas de Burgo, an Italian, who, from 1470 to 1500, wrote &s;everal tracts on arithmetic, containing the &s;um of what was then known of this &s;cience, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in the doctrine of the proportions of numbers, the nature of figurate numbers, and the extraction of roots, as far as the cubic root inclu&s;ively.</P>
<P N="7">7. It was not long however before the nature of the coefficients of all the higher powers became known, and tables formed for con&s;tructing them indefinitely. For in the year 1543 came out, at Norimberg, an excellent treati&s;e of arithmetic and algebra, by Michael Stifelius, a Ger|man divine, and an hone&s;t, but a weak, di&s;ciple of Luther. In this work, <HI>Arithmetica Integra,</HI> of Stifelius, are contained &s;everal curious
<PB N="69" REF="74">things, &s;ome of which have been a&s;cribed to a much later date. He here treats pretty fully and ably, of progre&s;&s;ional and figurate numbers, and in particular of the following table for con&s;tructing both them and the coefficients of the terms of all powers of a binomial, which has been &s;o often u&s;ed &s;ince his time for the&s;e and other purpo&s;es, and which more than a century after was, by Pa&s;cal, otherwi&s;e called the arithme|tical triangle, and who only mentioned &s;ome additional properties of the table.

</TABLE> Stifelius here ob&s;erves that the horizontal lines of this table furni&s;h the coefficients of the terms of the corre&s;pondent powers of a binomial; and teaches how to u&s;e them in extracting the roots of all powers what|ever. And after him the &s;ame table was u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, by Cardan, and Stevin, and the other writers on arithmetic. I &s;u&s;pect, however, that the nature of this table was known much earlier than the time of Stifelius, at lea&s;t &s;o far as regards the progre&s;&s;ions of figurate numbers, a doctrine amply treated of by Nicomachus, who lived, according to &s;ome, before Euclid, but not till long after him according to others; and who&s;e work on arithmetic was publi&s;hed at Paris in 1538; and which it is &s;uppo&s;ed was chiefly copied in the treati&s;e on the &s;ame &s;ubject by Boethius: but I have never &s;een either
<PB N="70" REF="75">of the&s;e two works. Though indeed Cardan &s;eems to a&s;cribe the in|vention of the table to Stifelius; but I &s;uppo&s;e that is only to be under&s;tood of its application to the extraction of roots. See Cardan's <HI>Opus Novum de Proportionibus,</HI> where he quotes it, and extracts the table and its u&s;e from Stifelius's book. Cardan al&s;o, at page 185, <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> of the &s;ame work, makes u&s;e of a like table to find the number of va|riations of things, or conjugations as he calls them.</P>
<P N="8">8. The contemplation of this table has probably been attended with the invention and exten&s;ion of &s;ome of our mo&s;t curious di&s;coveries in mathematics, both in regard to the powers of a binomial, with the con&s;equent extraction of roots, the doctrine of angular &s;ections by Vieta, and the differential method by Briggs and others. For, one or two of the powers or &s;ections being once known, the table would be of excel|lent u&s;e in di&s;covering and con&s;tructing the re&s;t. And accordingly we find this table u&s;ed on many occa&s;ions by Stifelius, Cardan, Stevin, Vieta, Briggs, Oughtred, Mercator, Pa&s;cal, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. On this occa&s;ion I cannot help mentioning the ample manner in which I &s;ee Stifelius, at fol. 35, <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> of the &s;ame book, treats of the nature and u&s;e of logarithms, though not under the &s;ame name, but under the idea of a &s;eries of arithmeticals, adapted to a &s;eries of geo|metricals. He there explains all their u&s;es; &s;uch as that the addition of them, an&s;wers to the multiplication of their geometricals; &s;ubtraction to divi&s;ion; multiplication of exponents, to involution; and dividing of exponents, to evolution. And he exemplifies the u&s;e of them in ca&s;es of the Rule-of-Three, and in finding mean proportionals between given terms, and &s;uch like, exactly as is done in logarithms. So that he &s;eems to have been in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the idea of logarithms, and wanted only the nece&s;&s;ity of trouble&s;ome calculations to induce him to make a table of &s;uch numbers.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="71" REF="76">10. But although the nature and con&s;truction of this table, namely of figurate numbers, was thus early known, and employed in the rai&s;ing of powers, and extracting of roots; yet it was only by rai&s;ing the num|bers one from another by continual additions, and then taking them from the table for u&s;e when wanted; till Briggs fir&s;t pointed out the way of rai&s;ing any horizontal line in the foregoing table by it&s;elf, with|out any of the preceding lines; and thus teaching to rai&s;e the terms of any power of a binomial, independent of any other powers; and &s;o gave the &s;ub&s;tance of the binomial &s;eries in words, wanting only the notation in &s;ymbols; as I have &s;hewn at large at page 75 of the hi&s;torical intro|duction to my Mathematical Tables.</P>
<P N="11">11. Whatever was known however of this matter, related only to pure or integral powers, no one before Newton having thought of extracting roots by infinite &s;eries. He happily di&s;covered, that, by con&s;idering powers and roots in a continued &s;eries, roots being as powers having fractional exponents, the &s;ame binomial &s;eries would equally &s;erve for them all, whether the index &s;hould be fractional or integral, or the &s;eries be finite or infinite.</P>
<P N="12">12. The truth of this method however was long known only by trial in particular ca&s;es, and by induction from analogy. Nor does it appear that even Newton him&s;elf ever attempted any direct proof of it. But various demon&s;trations of this theorem have been &s;ince given by the more modern mathematicians, of which &s;ome are by means of the doc|trine of fluxions, and others, more legally, from the pure principles of algebra only. Some of which I &s;hall here give a &s;hort account of.</P>
<P N="13">13. One of the fir&s;t was Mr. James Bernoulli. His demon&s;tration is, among &s;everal other curious things, contained in his little work called <HI>Ars Conjectandi,</HI> which has been improperly omitted in the collection of his works publi&s;hed by his nephew Nicholas Bernoulli. This is a &s;trict
<PB N="72" REF="77">demon&s;tration of the binomial theorem in the ca&s;e of integral and affirmative powers, and is to this effect. Suppo&s;ing the theorem to be true in any one power, as for in&s;tance, in the cube, it mu&s;t be true in the next higher power; which he demon&s;trates. But it is true in the cube, in the fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh powers, as will ea&s;ily appear by trial, that is by actually rai&s;ing tho&s;e powers by continual multipli|cations. Therefore it is true in all higher powers. All this he &s;hews in a regular and legitimate manner, from the principles of multipli|cation, and without the help of fluxions. But he could not extend his proof to the other ca&s;es of the binomial theorem, in which the powers are fractional. And this demon&s;tration has been copied by Mr. John Stewart, in his commentary on Sir I&s;aac Newton's quadrature of curves. To which he has added, from the principles of fluxions, a demon&s;tra|tion of the other ca&s;e, for roots or fractional exponents.</P>
<P N="14">14. In No. 230 of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1697, is given a theorem, by Mr. De Moivre, in imitation of the bi|nomial theorem, which is extended to any number of terms, and thence called the multinomial theorem; which is a general expre&s;&s;ion in a &s;eries, for rai&s;ing any multinomial quantity to any power. His de|mon&s;tration of the truth of this theorem, is independent of the truth of the binomial theorem, and contains in it a demon&s;tration of the binomial theorem as a &s;ubordinate propo&s;ition, or particular ca&s;e of the other more general theorem. And this demon&s;tration may be con|&s;idered as a legitimate one, for pure powers, founded on the principles of multiplication, that is, on the doctrine of combinations and permu|tations. And it proves that the law of the continuation of the terms, mu&s;t be the &s;ame in the terms not computed, or not &s;et down, as in tho&s;e that are written down.</P>
<P N="15">15. The ingenious Mr. Landen has given an inve&s;tigation of the binomial theorem, in his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Re&s;idual Analy&s;is,</HI> printed in 1758, and in the <HI>Re&s;idual Analy&s;is</HI> it&s;elf, printed in 1764.
<PB N="73" REF="78">The inve&s;tigation is deduced from this lemma, namely, if <HI>m</HI> and <HI>n</HI> be any integers, and <HI>q</HI> &equals; <HI>v</HI>/<HI>x,</HI> then is <GAP DESC="math"> which theorem is made the principal ba&s;is of his Re&s;idual Analy&s;is.</P>
<P>The inve&s;tigation is this: the binomial propo&s;ed being <GAP DESC="math">, a&s;|&s;ume it equal to the following &s;eries 1 &plus; <HI>ax</HI> &plus; <HI>bx</HI>^2 &plus; <HI>cx</HI>^3 &amp;c. with indeterminate coefficients.

<PB N="74" REF="79">Then, by comparing the homologous terms, the value of the coefficients <HI>a, b, c,</HI> &amp;c. are deduced for as many terms as you compare.</P>
<P>And a large account is given of this inve&s;tigation by the learned Dr. Hales, in his <HI>Analy&s;is Equationum,</HI> lately publi&s;hed at Dublin.</P>
<P>Mr. Landen then contra&s;ts this inve&s;tigation with that by the method of fluxions, which is as follows. A&s;&s;ume as before; <GAP DESC="math"> Take the fluxion of each &s;ide, and we have <GAP DESC="math"> Divide by <HI>x&cmbdot;,</HI> or take it &equals; 1, &s;o &s;hall <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Then multiply by 1 &plus; <HI>x,</HI> and &s;o on as above in the other way.</P>
<P N="16">16. Be&s;ides the above, which are the principal demon&s;trations and inve&s;tigations that have been given of this important theorem, I have been &s;hewn an ingenious attempt of Mr. Baron Ma&s;eres, to demon|&s;trate this theorem in the ca&s;e of roots or fractional exponents, by the help of De Moivre's multinomial theorem. But, not being quite &s;ati&s;|fied with his own demon&s;tration, as not expre&s;&s;ing the law of continua|tion of the terms which are not actually &s;et down, he was plea&s;ed to urge me to attempt a more complete and &s;atisfactory demon&s;tration of the general ca&s;e of roots, or fractional exponents. And he farther propo&s;ed it in this form, namely, that if Q be the coefficient of one of the terms of the &s;eries which is equal to <GAP DESC="math">, and P the coefficient of the next preceding term, and R the coefficient of the next follow|lowing term; then, if Q be <GAP DESC="math">, to prove that R will be <GAP DESC="math">. This he ob&s;erved would be quite perfect and &s;atisfactory,
<PB N="75" REF="80">as it would include all the terms of the &s;eries, as well tho&s;e that are omitted, as tho&s;e that are actually &s;et down. And I was, in my de|mon&s;tration, to &s;uppo&s;e, if I plea&s;ed, the truth of the binomial and mul|tinomial theorems for integral powers, as truths that had been previ|ou&s;ly and perfectly proved.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence I &s;ent him &s;oon after the &s;ub&s;tance of the following demon&s;tration; with which he was quite &s;atisfied, and which I now proceed to explain at large.</P>
<P N="17">17. Now the binomial integral is <GAP DESC="math">. where <HI>a, b, c,</HI> &amp;c. denote the whole coefficients of the 2d, 3d, 4th, &amp;c. terms, over which they are placed; and in which the law is this, namely, if P, Q, R, be the coefficients of any three terms in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and if <HI>g</HI>/<HI>b</HI> P &equals; Q, then is <GAP DESC="math">; as is evident; and which, it is granted, has been proved.</P>
<P N="18">18. And the binomial fractional is <GAP DESC="math">. in which the law is this, namely, if P, Q, R be the coefficients of three terms in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and if <HI>g</HI>/<HI>b</HI> P &equals; Q, then is <GAP DESC="math">. Which is the property to be proved.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="76" REF="81">19. Again, the multinomial integral is <GAP DESC="math">

Or, if we put <HI>a, b, c, d,</HI> &amp;c. for the coefficients of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, &amp;c. terms, the la&s;t &s;eries, by &s;ub&s;titution, will be transformed into this form, <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P N="20"><PB N="78" REF="83">20.

<P>Rai&s;e now <GAP DESC="math"> and its equivalent &s;eries 1 &plus; A &plus; B &plus; C &plus; &amp;c. both to the <HI>n</HI> power by the multinomial theorem, and we &s;hall have, as before, <GAP DESC="math"> Then equate the corre&s;ponding terms, and we have the fir&s;t term 1 &equals; 1.</P>
<P>Again, the &s;econd term of the &s;eries <HI>n</HI>/1 A, mu&s;t be equal to the &s;econd term <HI>x</HI> of the binomial. For none of the other terms of the &s;eries are equipollent, or contain the &s;ame power of <HI>x,</HI> with the term <HI>n</HI>/1 A. Not any of the terms A^2, A^3, A^4, &amp;c. for they are double, triple, quadru|ple, &amp;c. in power to A. Nor yet any of the terms containing B, C, D, &amp;c. becau&s;e, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, they contain all different and
<PB N="81" REF="86">increa&s;ing powers. It follows therefore, that <HI>n</HI>/1 A makes up the whole value of the &s;econd term <HI>x</HI> of the given binomial. Con&s;equently the &s;econd term A of the a&s;&s;umed &s;eries, contains only the fir&s;t power of <HI>x;</HI> and the whole value of that term A is &equals; 1/<HI>nx.</HI></P>
<P>But all the other equipollent terms of the expanded &s;eries mu&s;t be equal to nothing, which is the general value of the terms, after the &s;econd, of the given quantity 1 &plus; <HI>x</HI> or 1 &plus; <HI>x</HI> &plus; 0 &plus; 0 &plus; 0 &plus; &amp;c. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is therefore to find the &s;everal orders of equipollent terms of the expanded &s;eries. And the&s;e I &s;ay will be as I have arranged them above, in which B is equipollent with A^2, C with A^3, D with A^4, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>Now that B is equipollent with A^2, is thus proved. The value of the third term is 0. But <GAP DESC="math"> is a part of the third term. And it is only a part of that term: otherwi&s;e <GAP DESC="math"> would be &equals; 0, which it is evident cannot happen in every value of <HI>n,</HI> as it ought; for in|deed it happens only when <HI>n</HI> is &equals; 1. Some other quantity then mu&s;t be equipollent with <HI>n</HI>/1 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 A^2, and mu&s;t be joined with it, to make up the whole third term equal to 0. Now that &s;upplemental quantity can be no other than <HI>n</HI>/1B: for all the other following terms are evi|dently plupollent than B. It follows therefore, that B is equipol|lent with A^2, and contains the &s;econd power of <HI>x;</HI> or that <GAP DESC="math">, and con&s;equently <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>Again, the fourth term mu&s;t be &equals; 0. But the quantities <HI>n</HI>/1 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;2/3 A^3 &plus; <HI>n</HI>/1 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 AB are equipollent, and make up part of that fourth term. They are equipollent, or A^3 equipollent with AB, becau&s;e A^2 and B are equipollent. And they do not
<PB N="82" REF="87">con&s;titute the whole of that term; for if they did, then would <HI>n</HI>1 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;2/3 A^3 &plus; <HI>n</HI>/1 &middot; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 AB be &equals; 0 in all values of <HI>n,</HI> or <HI>n</HI>&minus;2/3 A^3 &plus; B &equals; 0: but it has been ju&s;t &s;hewn above, that <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2 A^2 &plus; B &equals; 0; it would therefore follow that <HI>n</HI>&minus;2/3 would be &equals; <HI>n</HI>&minus;1/2, a circum&s;tance which can only happen where <HI>n</HI> &equals; &minus;1, in&s;tead of taking place for every value of <HI>n.</HI> Some other quantity mu&s;t therefore be joined with the&s;e to make up the whole of the fourth term. And this &s;upplemental quantity can be no other than <HI>n</HI>/1 c, becau&s;e all the other following quantities are evidently plupollent than A^3 or AB. It follows therefore, that C is equipollent with A^3, and therefore contains the 3d power of <HI>x.</HI> And the whole value of C is <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>And the proce&s;s is the &s;ame for all the other following terms. Thus, then, we have proved the law of the whole &s;eries, both with re&s;pect to the coefficients of its terms, and to the powers of the letter <HI>x.</HI></P>

For the eye is in the place of the vertex of the cone; and the rays from the eye to the brim of the bowl, and thence continued from the nearer part of the brim, to the oppo&s;ite in|ternal &s;urface, form the &s;ides of the cone; which, by the propo&s;ition, will form a circular arc on the &s;aid internal &s;urface; becau&s;e the brim, which is the one &s;ection, is a circle.</P>

D. rector of Swan&s;combe in Kent, an ingenious and learned geometrician, and, what is &s;till more e&s;timable, a mo&s;t worthy and good man; one in who&s;e heart was found no guile, and who&s;e pure integrity, joined to the mo&s;t amiable &s;implicity of manners, and &s;weetne&s;s of temper, gained him the affection and re&s;pect of all who had the happine&s;s to be acquainted with him. His collection of problems in that pamphlet concluded with this &s;ingular one, "To divide a circle into any number of parts, which &s;hall be as well equal in area as in circumference.&mdash;N. B. <HI>This may &s;eem a paradox, however it may be effected in a manner &s;trictly geo|metrical.</HI>" The &s;olution of this &s;eeming paradox he re&s;erved to him|&s;elf, as far as I know. I fell upon the di&s;covery however &s;oon after; and other per&s;ons might do the &s;ame. My re&s;olution of it was pub|li&s;hed in an account which I gave of the pamphlet in the Critical Review for 1775, vol. xl. and which the author informed me was on
<PB N="94" REF="99">the &s;ame principle as his own. This account is in page 21 of that volume, and in the following words:</P>
<P N="2">2. "We have no doubt but that our mathematical readers will agree with us in allowing the truth of the author's remark concerning the &s;eeming paradox of this problem; becau&s;e there is no geometrical method of dividing the circumference of a circle into any propo&s;ed number of parts taken at plea&s;ure, and it does not readily appear that there can be any othermethod of re&s;olving the problem, than by draw|ing radii to the points of equal divi&s;ion in the circumference. However another method there is, and that &s;trictly geometrical, which is as follows.</P>
<P>"Divide the diameter AB of the given circle into as many equal parts as the circle it&s;elf is to be divided into, at the points C, D, E, &amp;c. Then on the diameters AC, AD, AE, &amp;c. as al&s;o on BE, BD, BC, &amp;c. de&s;cribe &s;emicircles, as in the annexed figure: and they will divide the whole circle as required.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>"For, the &s;everal diameters being in arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion, of which the common difference is equal to the lea&s;t of them, and the dia|meters of circles being as their circumferences, the&s;e will al&s;o be in arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion. But, in &s;uch a progre&s;&s;ion, the &s;um of the ex|tremes is equal to the &s;um of each two terms equally di&s;tant from them; therefore the &s;um of the circumferences on AC and CB, is equal to the &s;um of tho&s;e on AD and DB, and of tho&s;e on AE and EB, &amp;c. and each &s;um equal to the &s;emi-circumference of the given circle on the diameter AB. Therefore all the parts have equal perimeters, and each is equal to the circumference of the propo&s;ed circle. Which &s;atisfies one of the conditions in the problem.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="100">"Again, the &s;ame diameters being as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. and the areas of circles being as the &s;quares of their diameters, the &s;emicircles will be as the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, &amp;c. and con&s;equently the differences between all the adjacent &s;emicircles are as the terms of the arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion 1, 3, 5, 7, &amp;c. and here again the &s;ums of the extremes, and of every two equidi&s;tant means, make up the &s;eve|ral equal parts of the circle. Which is the other condition."</P>
<P N="3">3. But this &s;ubject admits of a more geometrical form, and is capa|ble of being rendered very general and exten&s;ive, and is moreover very fruitful in curious con&s;equences. For fir&s;t, in whatever ratio the whole diameter is divided, whether into equal or unequal parts, and whatever be the number of the parts, the peri|meters of the &s;paces will &s;till be equal. For &s;ince circumferences of circles are always as their diameters, and becau&s;e AB and AD &plus; DB and AC &plus; CB are all equal, therefore the &s;emi-circum|ferences c and b &plus; d and a &plus; e are all equal, and con&s;tant, whatever be the ratio of the parts AD, DC, CB, of the diame|ter. We &s;hall pre&s;ently find too that the &s;paces TV, RS, and PQ, will be univer&s;ally as the &s;ame parts AD, DC, CB, of the diameter.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P N="4">4. The &s;emicircles having been de&s;cribed as before mentioned, erect CE perpendicular to AB, and join BE. Then I &s;ay, the circle on the diameter BE, will be equal to the &s;pace PQ. For, join AE.
<PB N="96" REF="101">Now the &s;pace P &equals; &s;emicircle on AB &minus; &s;emicircle on AC: but the &s;emicir. on AB &equals; &s;emicir. on AE &plus; &s;emicir. on BE, and the &s;emicir. on AC &equals; &s;emicir. on AE &minus; &s;emicir. on CE, theref. &s;emic. AB &minus; &s;emic. AC &equals; &s;emic. BE &plus; &s;emicir. CE, that is the &s;pace P is &equals; &s;emic. BE &plus; &s;emicir. CE; to each of the&s;e add the &s;pace Q, or the &s;emicircle on BC, then P &plus; Q &equals; &s;emic. BE &plus; &s;emic. CE &plus; &s;emic. BC, that is P &plus; Q &equals; double the &s;emic. BE, or &equals; the whole circle on BE.</P>
<P N="5">5. In like manner, the two &s;paces PQ and RS together, or the whole &s;pace PQRS, is equal to the circle on the diameter BF. And therefore the &s;pace RS alone, is equal to the difference, or the circle on BF <HI>minus</HI> the circle on BE.</P>
<P N="6">6. But, circles being as the &s;quares of their diameters, BE^2, BF^2, and the&s;e again being as the parts or lines BC, BD, therefore the &s;paces PQ, PQRS, RS, TV, are re&s;pectively as the lines BC, BD, CD, AD, And if BC be equal to CD, then will PQ be equal to RS, as in the fir&s;t or &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence, to find a circle equal to the &s;pace RS, where the points D and C are taken at random: From either end of the diameter, as A, take AG equal to DC, erect GH perpendicular to AB, and join AH; then the circle on AH will be equal to the &s;pace RS. For, the &s;pace PQ: the &s;pace RS &proportion; BC &ratio; CD or AG, that is as BE^2: AH^2 the &s;quares of the diameters, or as the circle on BE to the cir|cle on AH; but the circle on BE is equal to the &s;pace PQ, and therefore the circle on AH is equal to the &s;pace RS.</P>
<P N="8">8. Hence, to divide a circle in this manner, into any number of parts, that &s;hall be in any ratios to one another: Divide the diameter
<PB N="97" REF="102">into as many parts, at the points D, C, &amp;c. and in the &s;ame ratios as tho&s;e propo&s;ed; then on the &s;everal di&s;tances of the&s;e points from the two ends A and B, as diameters, de&s;cribe the alternate &s;emicircles on the different &s;ides of the whole diameter AB: and they will divide the whole circle in the manner propo&s;ed. That is, the &s;paces TV, RS, PQ, will be as the lines AD, DC, CB.</P>
<P N="9">9. But the&s;e properties are not confined to the circle alone, but are to be found al&s;o in the ellip&s;e, as the genus of which the circle is only a &s;pecies. For if the annexed figure be an ellip&s;e de&s;cribed on the axis AB, the area of which is, in like manner, divided by &s;imilar &s;emiellip&s;es, de&s;cribed on AD, AC, BC, BD, as axes, all the &s;emiperimeters f, ae, bd, c, will be equal to one another, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as before in Art. 3, namely, becau&s;e the peripheries of ellip&s;es are as their diameters. And the &s;ame property would &s;till hold good, if AB were any other diameter of the ellip&s;e, in&s;tead of the axis; de&s;cribing upon the parts of it &s;emiellip&s;es which &s;hall be &s;imilar to tho&s;e into which the diameter AB divides the given ellip&s;e.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P N="10">10. And, if a circle be de&s;cribed about the ellip&s;e, on the diame|ter AB, and lines be drawn &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the &s;econd figure; then, by a proce&s;s the very &s;ame as in Art. 4, <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> &s;ub&s;tituting only &s;emiellip&s;e for &s;emicircle, it is found that the &s;pace

<P>Sect. 1. AT Woolwich in the year 1775, in conjunction with &s;ome able officers of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and other ingenious gentlemen, I fir&s;t in&s;tituted a cour&s;e of experiments on fired gunpowder and cannon balls. My account of them was pre&s;ented to the Royal Society, who honoured it with the gift of the annual gold medal, and printed it in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1778. The object of tho&s;e experiments, was the determination of the actual velocities with which balls are impelled from given pieces of cannon, when fired with given charges of powder. They were made according to the method invented by the very ingenious Mr. Robins, and de|&s;cribed in his treati&s;e on the new principles of gunnery, of which an account was printed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1743. Before the di&s;coveries and inventions of that gentleman, very little progre&s;s had been made in the true theory of military projectiles. His book however contained &s;uch important di&s;coveries, that it was &s;oon tran&s;lated into &s;everal of the languages on the continent, and the late &s;amous Mr. L. Euler honoured it with a very learned and exten&s;ive commentary, in his tran&s;lation of it into the German language. That
<PB N="100" REF="105">part of Mr. Robins's book has always been much admired, which re|lates to the experimental method of a&s;certaining the actual velocities of &s;hot, and in imitation of which, but on a large &s;cale, tho&s;e experiments were made which were de&s;cribed in my paper. Experiments in the manner of Mr. Robins were generally repeated by his commentators, and others, with univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; the method being &s;o ju&s;t in theory, &s;o &s;imple in practice, and altogether &s;o ingenious, that it imme|diately gave the fulle&s;t conviction of its excellence, and the eminent abilities of the inventor. The u&s;e which our author made of his inven|tion, was to obtain the real velocities of bullets experimentally, that he might compare them with tho&s;e which he had computed <HI>a priori</HI> from a new theory of gunnery which he had invented, in order to verify the principles on which it was founded. The &s;ucce&s;s was fully an&s;werable to his expectations, and left no doubt of the truth of his theory, at lea&s;t when applied to &s;uch pieces and bullets as he had u&s;ed. The&s;e however were but &s;mall, being only mu&s;ket balls of about an ounce weight: for, on account of the great &s;ize of the machinery nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch experiments, Mr. Robins, and other ingenious gentlemen, have not ventured to ex|tend their practice beyond bullets of that kind, but contented them|&s;elves with ardently wi&s;hing for experiments to be made in a &s;imilar manner with balls of a larger &s;ort. By the experiments de&s;cribed in my paper therefore I endeavoured, in &s;ome degree, to &s;upply that de|fect, having u&s;ed cannon balls of above twenty times the &s;ize, or from one pound to near three pounds weight. Tho&s;e are the only experi|ments, that I know of, which have been made in that way with can|non balls, although the conclu&s;ions to be deduced from &s;uch a cour&s;e, are of the greate&s;t importance in tho&s;e parts of natural philo&s;ophy which are connected with the effects of fired gunpowder: nor do I know of any other practical method be&s;ides that above, of a&s;certaining the initial velocities of military projectiles within any tolerable degree of the truth; except that of the recoil of the gun, hung on an axis in the &s;ame manner as the pendulum; which was al&s;o fir&s;t pointed out and u&s;ed by Mr. Robins, and which has lately been practi&s;ed al&s;o by Benjamin
<PB N="101" REF="106">Thomp&s;on, E&s;q. in his very ingenious and accurate &s;et of experiments with mu&s;ket balls, de&s;cribed in his paper in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions for the year 1781. The knowledge of this velocity is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in gunnery: by means of it, together with the law of the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium, every thing is determinable which re|lates to that bu&s;ine&s;s; for, as I remarked in the paper above-mentioned on my fir&s;t experiments, it gives us the law relative to the different quantities of powder, to the different weights of balls, and to the dif|ferent lengths and &s;izes of guns, and it is al&s;o an excellent method of trying the &s;trength of different &s;orts of powder. Be&s;ide the&s;e, there does not &s;eem to be any thing wanting to an&s;wer every inquiry that can be made concerning the flight and ranges of &s;hot, except the effects ari&s;ing from the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium.</P>
<P N="2">2. In that cour&s;e of experiments were compared the effects of differ|ent quantities of powder, from two to eight ounces; the effects of different weights of &s;hot; and the effects of different &s;izes of &s;hot, or different degrees of windage, which is the difference between the dia|meter of the &s;hot and the diameter of the bore; all of which were found to ob&s;erve certain regular and con&s;tant laws, as far as the experi|ments were carried. And at the end of each day's experiments, the deductions and conclu&s;ions were made, and the rea&s;ons clearly pointed out why &s;ome ca&s;es of velocity differ from others, as they properly and regularly ought to do. So that I am &s;urprized how they could be mi&s;|under&s;tood by Mr. Templehof, captain in the Pru&s;&s;ian artillery, when &s;peaking of the irregularities in &s;uch experiments, he &s;ays, (page 126 of <HI>Le Bombardier Pru&s;&s;ien,</HI> printed at Berlin, 1781) "La meme cho&s;e arriva a Mr. Hutton, il la trouva de 626 pieds, &amp; le jour &s;uivant de 973 pieds, <HI>tout les circon&s;tances &eacute;tant d'ailleurs &eacute;gales:</HI>" which la&s;t words &s;hew that Mr. T. had either mi&s;under&s;tood, or had not read the rea&s;on, which is a very &s;ufficient one, for this remarkable difference: it is expre&s;sly remarked in page 71 of my paper in the Philo&s;ophical
<PB N="102" REF="107">Tran&s;actions, that <HI>all the circum&s;tances</HI> were <HI>not</HI> the &s;ame, but that the one ball was much &s;maller than the other, and that it had the le&s;s de|gree of velocity, 626 feet, becau&s;e of the greater lo&s;s of the ela&s;tic fluid by the windage in the ca&s;e of the &s;maller ball. On the contrary, the velocities in tho&s;e experiments were even more uniform and &s;imilar thancould be expected in &s;uch large machinery, and in a fir&s;t attempt of the kind too. And from the whole, the following important con|clu&s;ions were fairly drawn and &s;tated, viz.</P>
<P>"(1.) And fir&s;t, it is made evident by the&s;e experiments, that pow|der fires almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, &s;eeing that almo&s;t the whole of the charge fires, though the time be much dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>"(2.) The velocities communicated to &s;hot of the &s;ame weight, with different quantities of powder, are nearly in the &s;ubduplicate ratio of tho&s;e quantities. A very &s;mall variation, in defect, taking place when the quantities of powder become great.</P>
<P>"(3.) And when &s;hot of different weights are fired with the &s;ame quantity of powder, the velocities communicated to them, are nearly in the reciprocal &s;ub-duplicate ratio of their weights.</P>
<P>"(4.) So that, univer&s;ally, &s;hot which are of different weights, and impelled by the firing of different quantities of powder, acquire velo|cities which are directly as the &s;quare roots of the quantities of powder, and inver&s;ely as the &s;quare roots of the weights of the &s;hot, nearly.</P>
<P>"(5.) It would therefore be a great improvement in artillery, to make u&s;e of &s;hot of a long form, or of heavier matter; for thus the mo|mentum of a &s;hot, when fired with the &s;ame weight of powder, would be increa&s;ed in the ratio of the &s;quare root of the weight of the &s;hot.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="108">"(6.) It would al&s;o be an improvement, to dimini&s;h the windage: for, by &s;o doing, one third or more of the quantity of powder might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>"(7.) When the improvements mentioned in the la&s;t two articles are con&s;idered as both taking place, it is evident that about half the quantity of powder might be &s;aved; which is a very con&s;iderable ob|ject. But important as this &s;aving may be, it &s;eems to be &s;till ex|ceeded by that of the guns: for thus a &s;mall gun may be made to have the effect and execution of one of two or three times its &s;ize in the pre&s;ent way, by di&s;charging a long &s;hot of two or three times the weight of its natural ball, or round &s;hot: and thus a &s;mall &s;hip might di&s;charge &s;hot as heavy as tho&s;e of the greate&s;t now made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>"Finally, as the above experiments exhibit the regulations with re|gard to the weight of powder and balls, when fired from the &s;ame piece of ordnance; &s;o by making &s;imilar experiments with a gun, varied in its length, by cutting off from it a certain part before each cour&s;e of experiments, the effects and general rules for the different lengths of guns, may be certainly determined by them. In &s;hort, the principles on which the&s;e experiments were made, are &s;o fruitful in con&s;equences, that, in conjunction with the effects of the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium, they &s;eem to be &s;ufficient for an&s;wering all the inquiries of the &s;peculative philo&s;opher, as well as tho&s;e of the practical artilleri&s;t."</P>
<P N="3">3. Such then was the &s;tate of the fir&s;t &s;et of experiments with cannon balls in the year 1775, and &s;uch were the probable advantages to be derived from them. I do not however know that any u&s;e has hitherto been made of them by authority for the public &s;ervice; unle&s;s perhaps we are to except the in&s;tance of Carronades, a &s;pecies of ordnance which hath &s;ince been invented, and in &s;ome degree adopted in the public
<PB N="104" REF="109">&s;ervice; for in this in&s;tance the proprietors of tho&s;e pieces, by availing them&s;elves of the circum&s;tances of large balls, and very &s;mall windage, with &s;mall charges of powder, have been able to produce very con&s;ider|able and u&s;eful effects with tho&s;e light pieces, at a very &s;mall expence. Or perhaps tho&s;e experiments were too much limited, and of too pri|vate a nature, to merit a more general notice. Be that however as it may, the pre&s;ent additional cour&s;e, which is to make the &s;ubject of this tract, will have very great advantages over the former, both in point of extent, variety, improvements in machinery, and in authority. His Grace the Duke of Richmond, the pre&s;ent ma&s;ter-general of the ordnance, in his indefatigable endeavours for the good of the public &s;ervice, was plea&s;ed to order this exten&s;ive cour&s;e of experiments, and to give directions for providing guns, and machinery, and every thing compleat and fitting for the proper execution of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. This cour&s;e of experiments has been carried on under the direction of Major Blomefield, in&s;pector of artillery, an officer of great profe&s;|&s;ional merit, and who&s;e ingenious contrivances in the machinery do him great credit. It has been our employment for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers, namely, tho&s;e of the years 1783, 1784, and 1785; and indeed it might be continued &s;till much longer, either by extending it to more objects, or to more repetitions of experiments for the &s;ame object.</P>
<P N="5">5. The objects of this cour&s;e have been various. But the principal articles of it as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) The velocities with which balls are projected by equal charges of powder, from pieces of the &s;ame weight and calibre, but of different lengths.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) The velocities with different charges of powder, the weight and length of the gun being the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="105" REF="110">(3.) The greate&s;t velocity due to the different lengths of guns, to be obtained by increa&s;ing the charge as far as the re&s;i&s;tance of the piece is capable of &s;u&s;taining.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) The effect of varying the weight of the piece; every thing el&s;e being the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(5.) The penetration of balls into blocks of wood.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(6.) The ranges and times of flight of balls; to compare them with their initial velocities, for determining the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(7.) The effect of wads; of different degrees of ramming, or compre&s;&s;ing the charge; of different degrees of windage; of different po&s;itions of the vent; of chambers, and trunnions, and every other circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to be known for the improvement of artillery.</ITEM>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Nature of the Experiment, and of the Machinery u&s;ed in it.</HEAD>
<P N="6">6. THE effects of mo&s;t of the circum&s;tances la&s;t mentioned are determined by the actual velocity with which the ball is projected from the mouth of the piece. Therefore the primary object of the experi|ments is, to di&s;cover that velocity in all ca&s;es, and e&s;pecially in &s;uch as u&s;ually occur in the common practice of artillery. This velocity is very great; from one thou&s;and to two thou&s;and feet or more, in a &s;econd of time. For conveniently e&s;timating &s;o great a velocity, the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary is, to reduce it, in &s;ome known proportion, to a &s;mall one.
<PB N="106" REF="111">Which we may conceive to be effected in this manner: &s;uppo&s;e the ball, projected with a great velocity, to &s;trike &s;ome very heavy body, &s;uch as a large block of wood, from which it will not rebound, &s;o that after the &s;troke they may both proceed forward together with a common velocity. By this means, it is obvious that the original velocity of the ball may be reduced in any proportion, or to any &s;low velocity which may con|veniently be mea&s;ured, by making the body &s;truck to be &s;ufficiently large: for it is well known that the common velocity, with which the ball and the block of wood would move on together after the &s;troke, bears to the original velocity of the ball before the &s;troke, the &s;ame ratio which the weight of the ball has to that of the ball and block together. Thus then velocities of one thou&s;and feet in a &s;econd are ea&s;ily reduced to tho&s;e of two or three feet only: which &s;mall velocity being mea&s;ured by any convenient means, let the number denoting it be increa&s;ed in the ratio of the weight of the ball to the weight of the ball and block together, and the original velocity of the ball it&s;elf will thereby be obtained.</P>
<P N="7">7. Now this reduced velocity is rendered ea&s;y to be mea&s;ured by a very &s;imple and curious contrivance, of Mr. Robins, which is this: the block of wood, which is &s;truck by the ball, in&s;tead of being left at liberty to move &s;traight forward in the direction of the motion of the ball, is &s;u&s;pended, like the weight of the vibrating pendulum of a clock, by a &s;trong iron &s;tem, having a horizontal axis at the top, on the ends of which it vibrates freely when &s;truck by the ball. The con|&s;equence of this &s;imple contrivance is evident: this large balli&s;tic pen|dulum, after being &s;truck by the ball, will be penetrated by it to a &s;mall depth, and it will then &s;wing round its axis, de&s;cribing an arch, which will be greater or le&s;s according to the force of the blow &s;truck; and from the magnitude of the arch de&s;cribed by the vibrating pendu|lum, the velocity of any point of the pendulum can be ea&s;ily computed: for a body acquires the &s;ame velocity by falling from the &s;ame height,
<PB N="107" REF="112">whether it de&s;cend perpendicularly down, or otherwi&s;e; therefore, ha|ving given the length of the arc de&s;cribed by the center of o&s;cillation, and its radius, the ver&s;ed &s;ine becomes known, which is the height per|pendicularly de&s;cended by that point of the pendulum. The height de|&s;cended being thus known, the velocity acquired in falling through that height becomes known al&s;o, from the common rules for the de&s;cent of bodies by the force of gravity. And the velocity of this center, thus obtained, is to be e&s;teemed the velocity of the whole pendulum it&s;elf: which being now given, that of the ball before the &s;troke becomes known, from the given weights of the ball and pendulum. Thus then the determination of the very great velocity of the ball is reduced to the men&s;uration of the magnitude of the arch de&s;cribed by the pendu|lum, in con&s;equence of the blow &s;truck.</P>
<P N="8">8. Now this arch may be determined in various ways: in the follow|ing experiments it was a&s;certained by mea&s;uring the length of its chord, which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful line about it for making the calculation by; and this chord was mea&s;ured &s;ometimes by means of a piece of tape or nar|row ribbon, the one end of which was fa&s;tened to the bottom of the pendulum, and the re&s;t of it made to &s;lide through a &s;mall machine con|trived for the purpo&s;e; and &s;ometimes it was mea&s;ured by the trace of the fine point of a &s;tylette in the bottom of the pendulum, made in an arch concentric with the axis, and covered with a compo&s;ition of a pro|per con&s;i&s;tence; which will be particularly de&s;cribed hereafter.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another &s;imilar method of mea&s;uring the great velocity of the ball is, by ob&s;erving the arch of recoil of the gun, when it is hung al&s;o after the manner of a pendulum: for, by loading the gun with adventitious weight, it may be made &s;o heavy as to &s;wing any convenient extent of arch we plea&s;e, which arch it is evident will be greater or le&s;s according to the velocity of the ball, or force of the in&s;lamed powder, &s;ince action and re-action are equal and contrary; that is, the velocity of the ball will
<PB N="108" REF="113">be greater than the velocity of the center of o&s;cillation of the gun, in the &s;ame proportion as the weight of the gun exceeds the weight of the ball. And therefore, if the velocity of the center of o&s;cillation of the gun be computed, from the chord of the arc de&s;cribed by it in the recoil, the velocity of the ball will be found by this proportion; namely, as the weight of the ball is to the weight of the gun, &s;o is the velocity of the gun to the velocity of the ball: that is, if the weight of powder had no effect on the recoil.</P>
<P N="10">10. This de&s;cription may &s;uffice to convey a general idea of the na|ture and principles of the experiment, for determining the velocity with which a ball is projected, by any charge of powder, from a piece of ord|nance. But it is to be ob&s;erved that, be&s;ides the center of o&s;cillation, and the weights of the ball and pendulum, or gun, the effect of the blow depends al&s;o on the place of the center of gravity in the pendulum or gun, and that of the point &s;truck, or the place where the force is ex|erted; for it is evident that the arch of vibration will be greater or le&s;s according to the &s;ituation of the&s;e two points al&s;o. It will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary now to give a more particular de&s;cription of the machinery, and of the methods of finding the afore&s;aid requi&s;ites; and then we &s;hall inve&s;tigate our general rules for determining the velocity of the ball, in all ca&s;es, from them and the chord of the arch of vibration, either of the pendulum or gun.</P>

<P N="11">11. FIVE very fine bra&s;s one-pounder guns were ca&s;t and pre|pared, in Woolwich Warren, for the&s;e experiments, and bored as true as po&s;&s;ible; the common diameter of their bore being 2 inches and 2/100
<PB N="109" REF="114">parts of an inch. The&s;e five guns are exactly repre&s;ented in plate 1, with the &s;cale of their dimen&s;ions, by which they were drawn. Three of the&s;e, namely, n^o. 1, 2, 3, are nearly of the &s;ame weight, but of the re&s;pective lengths of 15, 20, and 30 calibers; in order to a&s;certain the effect of different lengths of bore, with the &s;ame weight of gun, powder, and ball. The other two, n^o. 4 and 5, were heavier, and of 40 calibers in length; to obtain the effects of the longe&s;t pieces. N^o. 5 was more expre&s;&s;ly to &s;hew the effect of different lengths of the &s;ame gun: and for this purpo&s;e, it was to be fired a &s;ufficient number of rounds with its whole length; and then to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively dimini&s;hed, by &s;awing off it 6 or 12 inches at a time, till it &s;hould be all cut away: firing a num|ber of rounds with it at each length. And for the convenience of &s;u&s;|pending this gun near its center of gravity for all the different lengths of it, a long thin &s;lip was ca&s;t with it, extending along the under &s;ide of it, from the breech to almo&s;t the middle of its length. By perforating this &s;lip through with holes immediately under the center of gravity for each length, after being cut, a bolt was to pa&s;s through the hole, on which the gun might be &s;u&s;pended. The other guns were &s;lung by their trunnions.</P>

<P N="13">13. In the&s;e experiments, the velocity of the ball, by which the force of the powder is determined, was to be mea&s;ured both by the balli&s;tic pendulum into which the ball was fired, and by the arch of recoil of the gun, which was hung on an axis by an iron &s;tem, after the &s;ame
<PB N="111" REF="116">manner as the pendulum it&s;elf, and the arcs vibrated in both ca&s;es mea|&s;ured in the &s;ame way. Plates 11 and 111 contain general repre&s;enta|tions of the machinery of both; namely, a &s;ide view and a front view of each, as they hung by their &s;tem and axis on the wooden &s;upports. In plate 11, fig. 1 is the &s;ide-view of the pendulum, and fig. 2 the &s;ide|view of the gun, as &s;lung in their frames. And in plate 111, fig. 1 and 2 are the front-views of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="14">14. In fig. 1, of both plates, A is the pendulous block of wood, into which the balls are fired, &s;trongly bound with thick bars of iron, and hung by a &s;trong iron &s;tem, which is connected by an axis at top; the whole being firmly braced together by cro&s;&s;ing diagonal rods of iron. The cylin|drical ends of the axis, both in the gun and pendulum, were at fir&s;t placed to turn upon &s;mooth flat plate-iron &s;urfaces, having perpendicular pins put in before and behind the &s;ides of the axis, to keep it in its place, and prevent it from &s;lipping backwards and forwards. But, this method being attended with too much friction, the ends of the axis were &s;up|ported and made to roll upon curved pieces, having the convexity up|wards, and the pins, before and behind the axis, &s;et &s;o as not quite to touch it; which left a &s;mall degree of play to the axis, and made the fric|tion le&s;s than before. But, &s;till farther to dimini&s;h the friction, the lower &s;ide of the ends of the axis was &s;harpened off a little, &s;omething like the axis of a &s;cale beam, and made to turn in hollow grooves, which were rounded down at both ends, and &s;tanding higher in the middle, like the curvature of a bent cylinder; by which means the edge of the axis touched the grooves, not in a line, but in one point only; when it vi|brated with very great freedom, having an almo&s;t imperceptible degree of friction. The &s;everal times and occa&s;ions when the&s;e, and other im|provements, were introduced and u&s;ed, will be more particularly noticed in the journal of the experiments.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="112" REF="117">15. At fir&s;t, the chord of the arc, of vibration and recoil, was mea&s;ured by means of a prepared narrow tape, divided into inches and tenths, as before. A new contrivance of machinery was however made for it. From the bottom of the pendulum, or gun-frame, proceeded a tongue of iron, which was rai&s;ed or lowered by means of a &s;crew at B; this was cloven at the bottom C, to receive the end of the tape, and the lips then pinched together by a &s;crew, which held the tape fa&s;t. Immediately below this the tape was pa&s;&s;ed between two &s;lips of iron, which could be brought to any degree of nearne&s;s by two &s;crews; the&s;e pieces were made to &s;lide vertically up and down a groove in a heavy block of wood, and fixed at any height by a &s;crew D. One of the&s;e latter pieces was extended out a con&s;iderable length, to prevent the tape from getting over its ends, and entangling in the returns of the vibrations. The extent of tape drawn out in a vibration, it is evident, is the chord of the arc de&s;cribed, and counted in inches and tenths, to the radius mea&s;ured from the middle of the axis to the bottom of the tongue.</P>
<P N="16">16. This method however was found to be attended with much trouble, and many inconveniences, as well as doubts and uncertainty &s;ometimes. For which rea&s;ons we afterwards changed this method of mea&s;uring the chord of vibration for another, which an&s;wered much bet|ter in every re&s;pect. This con&s;i&s;ted in a block of wood, having its upper &s;urface EF formed into a circular arc, who&s;e center was in the middle of the axis, and con&s;equently its radius equal to the length from the axis to the upper &s;urface of the block. In the middle of this arch was made a &s;hallow groove of 3 or 4 inches broad, running along the middle, through the whole length of the arch. This groove was filled with a compo&s;ition of &s;oft-&s;oap and wax, of about the con&s;i&s;tence of honey, or a little firmer, and its upper &s;ide &s;moothed off even with the general &s;ur|face of the broad arch. A &s;harp &s;pear or &s;tylette then proceeded from the bottom of the pendulum or gun-frame, and &s;o low as ju&s;t to enter and &s;cratch along the &s;urface of the compo&s;ition in the groove, without
<PB N="113" REF="118">having any &s;en&s;ible effect in retarding the motion of the body. The trace remaining, the extent of it could ea&s;ily be mea&s;ured. This mea&s;urement was effected in the following manner:&mdash;A line of chords was laid down upon the upper &s;urface of the wooden arch, on each &s;ide of the groove, and the divi&s;ions marked with lines on a ground of white paint: the edge of a &s;traight ruler being then laid acro&s;s by the cor|re&s;ponding divi&s;ions, ju&s;t to touch the farthe&s;t extent of the trace in the compo&s;ition, gave the length of the chord as marked on the arch. To make the computations by the rule for the velocity ea&s;ier, the divi|&s;ions on the chords were made exact thou&s;andth parts of the radius, which &s;aved the trouble of dividing by the radius at every operation. The manner in which I con&s;tructed this line of chords on the face of the arch was this: The radius was made ju&s;t 10 feet; I therefore pre|pared a &s;mooth and &s;traight deal rod, upon which I &s;et off 10 feet; I then divided each foot into 10 equal parts, and each of the&s;e into 10 parts again; by which means the whole rod or radius was divided into 1000 equal parts, being 100th parts of a foot. I then transferred the divi&s;ions of the rod to the face of the arch in this manner, namely; the fir&s;t divi|&s;ion of the rod was applied to the &s;ide of the arch at the beginning of it, and made to turn round there as a center; then, in that po&s;ition, the rod, when turned vertically round that point, always touched the &s;ide of the arch, and the divi&s;ions of it were marked on the edge of the arch, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively as they came into a coincidence with it.</P>

Then, as it lay, the di&s;tance was mea&s;ured from the middle of the axis to the part which re&s;ted on the edge of the pri&s;m, or the place of the center of gravity, which is the di&s;tance <HI>g</HI> of that center below the axis.</P>

<P N="20">20. To find the center of o&s;cillation, the balli&s;tic pendulum, or the gun, was hung up by its axis in its place, and then made to vibrate in &s;mall arcs, for 1 minute, or 2, or 5, or 10 minutes; the more the better; as determined either by a half &s;econd pendulum, or a &s;top watch, or a peculiar time-piece, mea&s;uring the time to 40th parts of a &s;econd; and the number of vibrations performed in that time carefully counted. Having thus obtained the time an&s;wering to a certain number of vibra|tions, the center of o&s;cillation is ea&s;ily found: for if <HI>n</HI> denote the number of vibrations made in <HI>s</HI> &s;econds, and <HI>l</HI> the length of the &s;econd pendulum, then it is well known that <HI>n</HI>^2 &ratio; <HI>s</HI>^2 &proportion; <HI>l</HI> &ratio; <HI>s</HI>^2l / <HI>n</HI>^2 the di&s;tance from the axis of motion to the center of o&s;cillation.

Though the editor of his works, publi&s;hed in 1761, has inadvertently neglected this correction, and printed his book without taking any notice of it. And that remark, had M.

<P N="26">26. Before we quit this rule, it may be nece&s;&s;ary here to advert to three or four circum&s;tances which may &s;eem to cau&s;e &s;ome &s;mall error in the initial velocity, as determined by the formula in Art. 24. The&s;e are the friction on the axis, the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to the back of the pendulum, the time which the ball employs in penetrating the wood of the pendulum, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to the ball in its pa&s;&s;age be|tween the gun and the pendulum.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely, the friction on the axis, by which the extent of its vibration is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed; it may be ob&s;erved, that the effect of this cau&s;e can never amount to a quantity con&s;iderable enough to be brought into account in our experiments; for, be&s;ides that care was taken to render this friction as &s;mall as po&s;&s;ible, the effect of the &s;mall part which does remain is nearly balanced by the effect it has on the number <HI>n</HI> of vibrations performed in a minute; for the friction on the axis will a little retard its motion, and cau&s;e its vibrations to be &s;lower, and &s;ewer; &s;o that <HI>c</HI> the length of a vibration, and <HI>n</HI> the number of vibrations, being both dimini&s;hed by this cau&s;e, nearly in an equal degree, and <HI>c</HI> being a multiplier, and <HI>n</HI> a divi&s;or, in our formula, it is
<PB N="121" REF="126">evident that the effect of the friction in the one ca&s;e operates again&s;t that in the other, and that the difference of the two is the real di&s;|turbing cau&s;e, and which therefore is either equal to nothing, or very nearly &s;o.</P>
<P N="27">27. The &s;econd cau&s;e of error is the re&s;i&s;tance of the air again&s;t the back of the pendulum, by which its motion is &s;omewhat impeded. This re&s;i&s;tance hinders the pendulum from vibrating &s;o far, and de&s;cribing &s;o large an arch, as it would do if there was no &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance; therefore the chord of the arc which is actually de&s;cribed and mea&s;ured, is le&s;s than it really ought to be; and con&s;equently the velocity of the ball, which is proportional to that chord, will be le&s;s than the real velocity of the ball at the moment it &s;trikes the pendulum. And although the pen|dulum be very heavy, and its motion but &s;low, and con&s;equently the re&s;i&s;tance of the air again&s;t it very &s;mall, it will yet be proper to inve&s;ti|gate the real effect of it, that we may be &s;ure whether it may &s;afely be neglected or not.</P>
<P>In order to this, let the annexed figure repre&s;ent the back of the pendulum, moving on its axis; and put <HI>p</HI> &equals; weight of the pendulum, <HI>a</HI> &equals; DE its breadth, <HI>r</HI> &equals; AB the di&s;tance to the bottom, <HI>e</HI> &equals; AC the di&s;tance to the top, <HI>x</HI> &equals; AF any variable di&s;tance, <HI>g</HI> &equals; di&s;tance of the center of gravity, <HI>o</HI> &equals; di&s;tance of the center of o&s;cillation, <HI>v</HI> &equals; velocity of the center of o&s;cillation, in any part of the vibration, <HI>h</HI> &equals; 16.09 feet, the de&s;cent of gravity in 1 &s;econd, <HI>c</HI> &equals; the chord of the arc actually de&s;cribed by the center of o&s;cillation, and c &equals; the chord which would be de&s;cribed by it if the air had no re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P><PB N="126" REF="131">In the beginning of this inve&s;tigation, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the medium is equal to the weight of a column of the medium, who&s;e ba&s;e is the moving &s;urface, and its altitude equal to that from whence a heavy body mu&s;t fall to acquire the velocity of that &s;ur|face.

<P>Then is <HI>R</HI>/<HI>b</HI> the retarding force of the ball, which is con&s;tant. Again, as the motion of the pendulum ari&s;es from the re&s;i&s;ting force <HI>R</HI> of the

But in the action of forces that are con&s;tant, the time <HI>t</HI> is equal to the velocity divided by the force, and by 2<HI>h</HI> or 2 &times; 16.09 feet, and the &s;pace is equal to the &s;quare of the velocity divided by the force and by 4<HI>h;</HI> con&s;equently

<P>And when v &equals; <HI>u,</HI> or the action of the ball on the pendulum cea&s;es, this equation becomes <HI>pgo</HI>U &plus; <HI>bii</HI>U &equals; <HI>biiv,</HI> and hence u &equals; <HI>biiv</HI>/<HI>pgo</HI>&plus;<HI>bii</HI> is the greate&s;t velocity of the point C at the in&s;tant when the ball has penetrated to the greate&s;t depth, and cea&s;es to urge the pendulum farther. So that this velocity is the &s;ame, whatever the re&s;i&s;ting force of the wood is, and therefore to whatever depth the ball penetrates, and the &s;ame as if the wood were perfectly hard, or the ball made no penetration at all. And this velocity of the point of impact al&s;o agrees with that which was found in Art. 21. So that the velocity communicated to the point of impact is the &s;ame, whether the impul&s;e is made in an in&s;tant, or in &s;ome &s;mall portion of time. And hence, in the u&s;ual ca&s;e of a penetration, becau&s;e the block will have moved &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance before it has attained its greate&s;t velocity, it might at fir&s;t view &s;eem as if it would &s;wing or ri&s;e higher than when that velocity is communicated in an in&s;tant, or when the pendulum is yet in its ver|tical po&s;ition, and &s;o might de&s;cribe a longer chord, and &s;hew a greater velocity of the ball than it ought. But on the other hand it mu&s;t be
<PB N="128" REF="133">con&s;idered, that in the &s;mall part of its &s;wing, which the pendulum has made before the penetration is completed, or has attained its greate&s;t velocity, ju&s;t as much velocity will be lo&s;t by the oppo&s;ing gravity or weight of the pendulum, as if it had &s;et out from the vertical po&s;ition with the &s;aid greate&s;t velocity; and therefore the real velocity at that height will be the &s;ame in both ca&s;es. Hence then it may &s;afely be con|cluded, that the circum&s;tance of the ball's penetration cau&s;es no altera|tion in the velocity of it, as computed by our formula. And as it was before found that no &s;en&s;ible error is incurred by the two fir&s;t circum|&s;tances, namely, the friction on the axis, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to the back of the pendulum, we may be well a&s;&s;ured that our formula brings out the true velocity with which the ball &s;trikes the pendulum, without any &s;en&s;ible error.</P>
<P N="29">29. Since <HI>biiv</HI>/<HI>pgo</HI>&plus;<HI>bii</HI> denotes the greate&s;t velocity which the point c of the pendulum acquires by the &s;troke, dividing by <HI>i,</HI> we &s;hall have <HI>biv</HI>/<HI>pgo</HI>&plus;<HI>bii</HI> for the angular velocity of the pendulum, or that of a radius 1. From which it appears that the vibration will be very &s;mall when <HI>i</HI> or the di&s;tance AD is &s;mall, and al&s;o when <HI>i</HI> is very great. And if we take this expre&s;&s;ion a <HI>maximum,</HI> and make its fluxion &equals; 0, <HI>i</HI> only being variable, we &s;hall obtain <HI>pgo</HI> &equals; <HI>bii,</HI> and <HI>i</HI> &equals; &radic; <HI>pgo</HI>/<HI>b</HI> for the di&s;tance of the center of percu&s;&s;ion, or the point where the ball mu&s;t &s;trike &s;o as to cau&s;e the greate&s;t vibration in the pendulum; which point, in this ca&s;e, is neither the center of gravity nor the center of o&s;cillation; but will be at a great di&s;tance below the axis when <HI>p</HI> is great re&s;pect of <HI>b,</HI> as in the ca&s;e of our experiments, in which <HI>p</HI> is 600 or 800 times <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P N="30"><PB N="129" REF="134">30. It may not be improper here, by the way, to enquire a little into the time of the penetration, its extent or depth, and the mea&s;ure of the re&s;i&s;ting force of the wood.</P>
<P>It was found above that <HI>x</HI> &equals; <HI>pgouu</HI>/4<HI>hiiR,</HI> and <HI>x</HI> &plus; <HI>z</HI> &equals; <HI>b</HI>/4<HI>hR</HI> &times; (<HI>v</HI>^2 &minus; v^2).

<P>Hence al&s;o it appears that, other things remaining, the penetration will be le&s;s, as <HI>i</HI> is greater, or as the point of impact is farther below the axis. It is farther evident that the penetration will dimini&s;h as the &s;um of the forces <HI>pgo</HI> dimini&s;hes.</P>
<P>Now, for an example in numbers, a ball fired with a velocity of 1500 feet per &s;econd, has been found to penetrate about 14 inches into a block of &s;ound dry elm, when the dimen&s;ions of the pendulum were as below:

<P N="31">31. Upon the whole then it appears, that our rule will give, without &s;en&s;ible error, the true velocity with which the ball &s;trikes the pendulum. But this is not, however, the &s;ame velocity with which the ball i&s;&s;ues from the mouth of the gun, which will indeed be &s;omething greater than the former, on account of the re&s;i&s;tance of the air which the ball pa&s;&s;es through in its way from the gun to the pendulum. And although this &s;pace of air be but &s;mall, and although the ela&s;tic fluid of the pow|der pur&s;ue and urge the ball for &s;ome di&s;tance without the mouth of the piece, and &s;o in &s;ome degree counteract the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, yet it will be proper to enquire into the effect of this re&s;i&s;tance, as it will pro|bably cau&s;e a difference between the velocity of the ball, as computed from the vibration of the pendulum and the vibration of the gun; which difference will, by the bye, be no bad way of mea&s;uring the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, e&s;pecially if the gun be placed at a good di&s;tance from the pendulum; for the vibration of the gun will mea&s;ure the velocity with which the ball i&s;&s;ues from the mouth of it; and the vibration of the pen|dulum the velocity with which it is &s;truck by the ball.</P>
<P N="32">32. To find therefore the re&s;i&s;tance of the air again&s;t the ball in any ca&s;e: it is fir&s;t to be con&s;idered that the re&s;i&s;tance to a plane moving
<PB N="131" REF="136">perpendicularly through a fluid at re&s;t, is equal to the weight or pre&s;&s;ure of a column of the fluid who&s;e altitude is the height through which the body mu&s;t fall by the force of gravity to acquire the velocity with which it moves through the fluid, the ba&s;e of the column being equal to the plane.

<P>Now if <HI>d</HI> denote the diameter of the ball, and <HI>k</HI> &equals; .7854, then &s;hall <HI>a</HI> &equals; <HI>kd</HI>^2 be a great circle of the ball; and con&s;equently <GAP DESC="math"> the motive force on the &s;urface of a circle equal to a great circle of the ball.</P>
<P>But the re&s;i&s;tance on the hemi&s;pherical &s;urface of the ball is only one half of that on the flat circle of the &s;ame diameter; therefore <GAP DESC="math"> is the motive force on the ball; and if <HI>w</HI> denote its weight, <GAP DESC="math"> will be equal to <HI>f</HI> the retarding force.</P>
<P>Since &frac23;<HI>kd</HI>^3 is the magnitude of the &s;phere, if N denote its den&s;ity or &s;pecific gravity, its weight <HI>w</HI> will be &equals; &frac23;<HI>kd</HI>^3 N; con&s;equently the re|tarding force <HI>f</HI> or <HI>m / w</HI> will be <GAP DESC="math">.</P>

Or if A be &equals; 2.718281828 &amp;c. the number who&s;e hyperbolic logarithm is 1,
<PB N="132" REF="137">then is v / <HI>v</HI> &equals; A^e^x, and hence the velocity <HI>v</HI> &equals; v / A^e^x &equals; VA^&minus;^e^x. So that the fir&s;t velocity is to the la&s;t velocity, as A^e^x to 1. And the ve|locity lo&s;t by the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium is (A^e^x &minus; 1) <HI>v</HI> or A^e^x&minus;1/A^e^x V.</P>
<P N="33">33. Now to adapt this to the ca&s;e of our balls, which weighed on a medium 16&frac34; ounces when the diameter was 1.96 inches; we &s;hall have 1.96^3 &times; .5236 &equals; the magnitude of the ball; and as 1 cubic foot, or 1728 cubic inches, of water, weighs 1000 ounces, therefore <GAP DESC="math"> is the &s;pecific gravity of the iron ball; which is very ju&s;tly &s;omething le&s;s than the u&s;ual &s;pecific gravity of &s;olid ca&s;t iron, on account of the &s;mall air bubble which is in all ca&s;t metal balls.

<P>Now the common di&s;tance of the face of the pendulum from the trun|nions of all the guns, was 35&frac12; feet; and the di&s;tance of the muzzles of the four guns, was nearly 34&frac14; for the 1&s;t or &s;horte&s;t gun, 34 for the 2d, 33 for the 3d, and 31&frac12; for the 4th. But as the ela&s;tic fluid pur&s;ues and urges the ball for a few feet after it is out of the gun, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed to counter-balance the re&s;i&s;tance of the air for a few feet, the num|ber of which cannot be certainly known, and therefore we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e 32 feet to be the common di&s;tance, for each of the guns, which the ball pa&s;&s;es through before it reach the pendulum. Hence then the di&s;tance <HI>x</HI> &equals; 32; and con&s;equently <HI>ex</HI> &equals; 32/2666 &equals; 16/1333.</P>
<P>Then A^e^x &minus; 1 &equals; .01207 &equals; 1/83 nearly. That is, the ball lo&s;es nearly the 83d part of its la&s;t velocity, or the 84th part of its fir&s;t velocity, in pa&s;&s;ing from the gun to the pendulum, by the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the air. Or the velocity at the mouth of the gun, is to the velocity at the pendulum, as 84 to 83; &s;o that the greater dimini&s;hed by its 84th part gives the le&s;s, and the le&s;s increa&s;ed by its
<PB N="133" REF="138">83d part gives the greater. But if the re&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch &s;wift velocities as ours be about three times as great as that above, computed from the nature of perfect and infinitely compre&s;&s;ed fluids, as Mr. Robins thinks he has found it to be, then &s;hall the velocity at the gun lo&s;e its 28th part, and the greater velocity will be to the le&s;s, as 28 to 27. This however is a circum&s;tance to be di&s;covered from our experiments, or otherwi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Velocity of the Ball, as found from the Recoil of the Gun.</HEAD>
<P N="34">34. It has been &s;aid by more than one writer on this &s;ubject, that the effect of the inflamed power on the recoil of the gun, is the &s;ame whether it be charged with a ball, or fired by it&s;elf alone; that is, that the exce&s;s of the recoil when charged with a ball, over the recoil when fired without a ball, is exactly that which is due to the motion and re|&s;i&s;tance of the ball. And this they &s;ay they have found from repeated experiments. Now &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e experiments to be accurate, and the deductions from them ju&s;tly drawn; yet as they have been made only with &s;mall balls and &s;mall charges of powder, it may &s;till be doubted whether the &s;ame law will hold good when applied to &s;uch cannon balls, and large charges of powder, as tho&s;e u&s;ed in our pre&s;ent experiments. Which is a circum&s;tance that remains to be determined from the re&s;ults of them. And this determination will be ea&s;ily made, by comparing the velocity of the ball as computed from this law, with that which is computed from the vibration of the balli&s;tic pendulum. For if the law hold good in &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, then the velocity of the ball, as deduced from the vibration of the gun, will exceed that which is deduced from the vibration of the pendulum, by as much as the velocity is dimini&s;hed by the re&s;i&s;tance of the air between the gun and the pendulum.</P>
<P N="35"><PB N="134" REF="139">35. Taking this for granted then in the mean time, namely, that the effect of the charge of powder on the recoil of the gun, is the &s;ame either with or without a ball, it will be proper here to inve&s;tigate a for|mula for computing the velocity of the ball from the recoil of the gun. Now upon the foregoing principle, if the chord of vibration be found for any charge without a ball, and then for the &s;ame charge with a ball, the difference of tho&s;e chords will be equal to the chord which is due to the motion of the ball. This follows from the property of a circle and a body de&s;cending along it, namely, that the velocity is always as the chord of the arc de&s;cribed in a &s;emivibration.</P>

Farther, as the quantities G, <HI>g, b, i, r, n</HI> commonly remain the &s;ame, the velocity will be directly as the chord <HI>c.</HI> So that if we a&s;&s;ume a ca&s;e in which the chord &s;hall be 1, and call its corre&s;ponding velocity <HI>u;</HI> then &s;hall <HI>v</HI> &equals; <HI>cu;</HI> or the velocity corre&s;ponding to any
<PB N="136" REF="141">other chord <HI>c,</HI> will be found by multiplying that chord <HI>c</HI> by the fir&s;t velocity <HI>u</HI> an&s;wering to the chord 1.</P>
<P>Now, by the following experiments, the u&s;ual values of tho&s;e literal quantities were as follows: viz. G &equals; 917 <HI>g</HI> &equals; 80.47 <HI>b</HI> &equals; 1.047, &s;ometimes a little more or le&s;s. <HI>i</HI> &equals; 89.15 <HI>r</HI> &equals; 1000 <HI>n</HI> &equals; 40.0, for the gun n^o 2, (but the 400th part more for n^o 1, and the 400th part le&s;s for n^o 3, and the 200th part le&s;s for n^o 4.)</P>
<P>Then, writing the&s;e values in the theorem, in&s;tead of the letters, it be|comes <HI>v</HI> &equals; 12.15<HI>c.</HI> So that the number 12.15 multiplied by the difference between two chords de&s;cribed with any charge, the one with and the other without a ball, will give the velocity of the ball when the dimen&s;ions are as &s;tated above. And when the values of any of the let|ters vary from the&s;e, it is but increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing that product in the &s;ame proportion, according as the letter belongs to the numerator or denominator in the general formula 59000/96 &times; <HI>Ggc</HI>/<HI>birn.</HI> When &s;uch va|riations happen, they will be mentioned in each day's experiments. And farther when only the values of G, <HI>g, i, n</HI> are as before &s;peci|fied, the &s;ame formula will become 12718 &times; <HI>c</HI>/<HI>br.</HI></P>
<P>But note that the&s;e rules are adapted to the gun n^o 2 only; therefore for n^o 1 we mu&s;t &s;ubtract the 400th part, and add the 400th part for n^o 3, and add the 200th part for n^o 4.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P N="37">37. WE &s;hall now proceed to &s;tate the circum&s;tances of the experi|ments for each day &s;eparately as they happened; by this means &s;hewing all the proce&s;&s;es for each &s;et of experiments, with the failure or &s;ucce&s;s of every trial and mode of operation; and from which al&s;o any per&s;on may recompute all the re&s;ults, and otherwi&s;e combine and draw con|clu&s;ions from them as occa&s;ion may require. Making but a very few cur&s;ory remarks on each day's experiments, to explain them when ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and re&s;erving the chief philo&s;ophical deductions, to be drawn and &s;tated together, after the clo&s;e of the experiments, in a more con|nected and methodical way.</P>
<P>The machinery having been made as perfect as the circum&s;tances would permit, 20 barrels of government powder were procured, all by the be&s;t maker, and numbered from 1 to 20. A great number of iron balls were al&s;o ca&s;t on purpo&s;e, very round, and their accidental a&s;peri|ties ground off: they were a little varied in their &s;ize and weight, but mo&s;t of them almo&s;t equal to the diameter of the bore, &s;o as to have but little windage. The powder was uniformly mixed, and every day exactly weighed off by the &s;ame careful man, and put up in very thin flannel bags, of a &s;ize ju&s;t to fit the bore of the gun; a thread was tied round clo&s;e by the powder, after being &s;haken down, and the flan|nel cut off clo&s;e by the thread, &s;o as to leave as &s;hort a neck as po&s;&s;ible to the bag. The charge of powder was pu&s;hed gently down to the lower or breech end of the bore, and the &s;ame quantity of powder al|ways made to occupy nearly the &s;ame extent, by means of the divi&s;ions of inches and tenths marked on the ramrod. The ball was then put in, without u&s;ing any wads, and &s;et clo&s;e to the charge of powder, and kept in its place by a fine thread cro&s;&s;ed two or three times about it, which by its friction gave it a hold of the &s;ides of the bore, as the windage was very &s;mall. The gun was directed point blank, or horizontal, and
<PB N="138" REF="143">perpendicular to the face of the pendulum block, 35&frac12; feet di&s;tant from the trunnions, and was well wiped and cleaned out after each di&s;charge, which was made by piercing the bottom of the charge through the vent, and firing it by means of a &s;mall tube. An account was kept of the barometer and thermometer, placed within a hou&s;e adjoining, and &s;haded from the &s;un.</P>
<P>The machinery having been all prepared and &s;et up in a convenient place in Woolwich Warren, Major Blomefield and I went out on the 6th of June 1783, with a &s;ufficient party of men, to try the effects of them for the fir&s;t time, which were as follows.</P>

<P>The weather was warm, dry, and clear.</P>
<P>The barometer at 30.17, and thermometer at 60&deg;.</P>
<P>The intention of this day's experiments, was to try and adju&s;t the apparatus; to a&s;certain the proper di&s;tance of the pendulum; as al&s;o the comparative &s;trength of the different barrels of powder, by firing &s;everal charges of it, without balls or wads. Out of the 20 barrels of powder, were &s;elected the 6 which had been found to be mo&s;t uniform, and neare&s;t alike, by the different eprouvettes at Purfleet, which were n^o^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 2, 5, 13, 15, 18, 19; of which the fir&s;t two only were tried this day, as below. The gun was the &s;hort one, n^o 1, and weighed this day, with leaden weights and iron &s;tem, 906 lb: the di&s;tance of the tape, by which the chord of its recoil was mea&s;ured, was not taken, and it was probably a little more than the u&s;ual length, 110 inches, employed in mo&s;t of the experiments of this year.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="144">Here it appears that the quan|tity of recoil increa&s;ed in a higher ratio than the quantity of powder.</P>

<P>All the charges were in flannel bags, except n^o^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 14 and 18, of 16 oz each, for want of bags large enough provided to put it in. Each charge was rammed with two or three &s;light &s;trokes. A con&s;iderable quantity of the powder of n^o 14 was blown out unfired; many of the grains were found on the ground, and on the top of the pendulum block, and many were found &s;ticking in the face of it. By the force of the&s;e &s;triking it, and by the bla&s;t of the powder, or motion of the air, the pendulum was ob&s;erved vi&s;ibly to vibrate a little: but the mea&s;uring tape had not been put to it. This was therefore now added, to mea&s;ure the vibration by. And, to try to what degree the pen|dulum would be affected by the explo&s;ion of the powder, the 7 feet amu&s;ette was &s;u&s;pended, and pointed oppo&s;ite the center of the pendulum for the la&s;t 4 rounds. The pendulum was accordingly ob&s;erved to move with the 8 ounces, but more with the 16 ounces, as appears at the bottom of the la&s;t column of the table above. The pendulum being thus much affected, we were convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of making a paper &s;creen to place between the gun and the pendulum; which we accordingly did, and u&s;ed it in the whole cour&s;e of experiments, at lea&s;t in the larger charges. At the la&s;t charge, which was 16 ounces of loo&s;e powder, much &s;ewer grains were blown out than with the like charge at n^o 14 with the &s;hort gun. The recoil at n^o 14 is evidently le&s;s than it ought to be;
<PB N="141" REF="146">owing to the quantity of unfired powder that was blown out. It is re|markable that the recoil of the two guns, with the &s;ame charge, both for 2 ounces and 8 ounces, are nearly in the reciprocal ratio of the weights of the guns; a &s;mall exce&s;s only, over that proportion, taking place in favour of the long gun, as due to its &s;uperior length. The recoils are each vi&s;ibly in a higher proportion than the charges of powder: for, in the la&s;t four experiments, the charges of 2, 4, 8, 16 ounces, are in the continued proportion of 1 to 2; which their recoils 4.5, 10.8, 24.7, 53.3, are all in a higher ratio than that of 1 to 2; for, dividing the 2d by the 1&s;t, the 3d by the 2d, and the 4th by the 3d, the three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive quotients are 2.40, 2.29, 2.16, which are all above the double ratio, but approximating, however, towards it as the charge is increa&s;ed. And farther, if we divide the&s;e quotients &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one by another, the two new ratios or quotients will be nearly equal. So that, ranging tho&s;e recoils in a column under each other, and their two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive orders of ratios in the adjacent columns, we &s;hall have in one view the law which they ob&s;erve, as here below, where they always tend to equality.</P>

<P>The air moi&s;t, with &s;mall rain at intervals.</P>
<P>The gun n^o 2 was mounted, and loaded with all the leaden weights: it was charged with the following quantities of powder; &s;ometimes with a ball, and &s;ometimes without one, as denoted by the cipher o, in the columns of weight and diameter of ball. The radius to the tape was &mdash;. As the&s;e experiments were made only to di&s;cover if the leaden weights would render the gun &s;ufficiently heavy, that the recoil might not be too large with the high charges of powder and ball, the pendulum block was removed, to let the balls enter and lodge in the bank which was be|hind it</P>
<P>Here again it appears that the recoils, without balls, are always in a greater ratio than the charges of powder. It al&s;o appears that the recoils, when balls are em|ployed, are nearly in the ratio of the quantities of powder, when the charges are &s;mall; but gra|dually decrea&s;ing more and more below that ratio, as the charge of powder is increa&s;ed.

<P>A large piece had been cut out of the middle part of the pendulum, from the face almo&s;t to the back, to clear away the damaged part of the wood; and the vacuity was run full of lead, from an idea that the pen|dulum would not &s;o &s;oon be &s;poiled, and con&s;equently that it would need le&s;s repairs. But this did not &s;ucceed at all; for the only &s;hot we di&s;charged, namely, n^o 9, would not lodge in the lead, but broke into a thou&s;and &s;mall pieces, many of which &s;tuck in the lead, and formed a curious appearance; but the greater number rebounded back again, to the great danger of the by-&s;tanders. The ball made a large round exca|vation in the face of the lead, of 5 inches diameter in the front, and 3&frac12; inches deep in the center of the hole.</P>
<P>Length of the charge of 16 oz was 11 inches.</P>

<P>The mean length of the charge of 16 oz was 11.7 inches. But this height was always taken when the cartridge was uncompre&s;&s;ed: &s;o that the powder lay loo&s;er than in former experiments. By a &s;mall pre&s;&s;ure it occupied about &frac14; of an inch le&s;s &s;pace.</P>
<P>The value of <HI>p</HI> at beginning this day is made a little le&s;s than the pendulum weighed at fir&s;t, for rea&s;ons to be mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>The mean recoil with a ball is 44.0, and without a ball 28.5, the difference of which is 15.5 &equals; <HI>c.</HI> Al&s;o, in the formula for the velocity by means of the gun, we have <HI>b</HI> &equals; 1.051, and <HI>r</HI> &equals; 110.2. Con&s;e|quently <HI>v</HI> &equals; 401/400 &times; 12718 &times; <HI>c / br</HI> &equals; 1706 for the velocity by that method.

<P>It had remained hanging &s;ince the la&s;t day's experiments, with all the balls and plugs in it, which increa&s;ed its weight by 10 lb, except an al|lowance for evaporation, and increa&s;ed the di&s;tance of the center of gravity by little more than 1/10th of an inch. It vibrated with great free|dom; for it had this day been made to turn very freely on its axis, by placing the upright pins, which confine it &s;ide-ways, &s;o as not quite to touch the axis, like tho&s;e of the gun ye&s;terday; and the effect was very great indeed, for it appeared as if it would have vibrated for a great length of time; whereas on the former days it &s;topped motion in about 1 minute, or at lea&s;t after that the arcs &s;oon became too &s;mall to be counted.&mdash;By this day's firing the pendulum &s;eemed not to be much injured, the back part not appearing to be altered, and the fore part only a little &s;welled out, the piece of wood, that had been fitted in there, &s;tarting a little forward, and bulging out the facing of lead.</P>

But, from the weight of the balls and plugs lodged in it, it ought to have weighed 732 lb. It is therefore likely that the 6 lb had been lo&s;t, by evaporation of the moi&s;ture, in the 4 days, which is 1&frac12;lb per day. At the beginning of each day's experiments therefore 1&frac12;lb is deducted from the weight of the pendulum, or 2lb before each of the la&s;t three days.

At the 6th round an uncommon large quantity of powder came out unfired, &s;o as to &s;catter a great way over the ground, and be&s;patter the face of the &s;creen and pendulum very much; which was not the ca&s;e in any other round. And this may ac|count for the &s;maller arcs de&s;cribed at that number.</P>
<P>The PENDULUM was in the &s;ame condition as it had been left hang|ing after the la&s;t day's experiments, with all the balls and plugs in it. After this day's experiments, its weight was found to be 681 lb, inclu|ding all the balls and plugs, except one which flew out behind the pen|dulum at the 7th round, occa&s;ioned by this ball &s;triking in the &s;ame hole as n^o 6, and knocking it out. This ball, which came out, was quite whole and perfect; it was black on the hinder part with the pow|der, but rubbed bright before with the friction in pa&s;&s;ing through the wood. The tape of the pendulum al&s;o broke at this round, &s;o that the vibration could not be mea&s;ured.</P>

The charge of powder was gradually increa&s;ed till the gun became quite full at n^o 10, when there was ju&s;t room for half the ball to lie within the muzzle; which being too &s;hort a length to give a direction to the ball, it mi&s;&s;ed the pendulum, going over and ju&s;t &s;triking the top of the &s;creen frame, about 21&frac12; inches above the line of direction, which, though a very &s;lender piece of wood, turned the ball up into a &s;till higher direction, in which it &s;truck the bank over the pen|dulum, and entered it &s;loping, though but a little way: all which cir|cum&s;tances &s;hew that the force of the ball was but &s;mall. And even at the 9th round, when the center of the ball was about 3 inches within the gun, the ball &s;truck the pendulum 5 inches out of the line of direction. The gun was &s;carce ever &s;en&s;ibly heated.</P>
<P>The diameter of the balls 1.96 inches.</P>
<P>The PENDULUM had been gutted, and had received a new core. It was hung up in the morning of the day before ye&s;terday, when it weighed 659 lb. And when taken down this evening it weighed only 686 lb, which is near 4 lb le&s;s than the balls and plugs ought to make it; and which 4 pounds mu&s;t have evaporated in the 3 days.</P>
<P>The plugs weighed &frac78; of an ounce to the inch.</P>

<P>All the three rounds with 16 oz are very doubtful, and &s;eem to be too low, from &s;ome unknown cau&s;e.</P>

And when taken down this evening it weighed only 678 lb with all the balls and plugs, the whole ball which came out behind, as well as the broken pieces of the wood and balls which flew out in the latter rounds, being collected and weighed with it; which is about 15&frac12; lb le&s;s than it ought to be; &s;o that about 15&frac12; lb has been lo&s;t by evaporation in the &s;pace of 30 hours, or about half a pound an hour.</P>
<P>At n^os 4, 8, 10 the tape of the pendulum entangled and broke, which rendered tho&s;e vibrations doubtful, as marked D. Some other rounds are marked doubtful, from &s;ome other cau&s;e, perhaps the badne&s;s of the wood in the pendulum, which &s;plit very much; from which circum|&s;tance part of the force of the ball might be lo&s;t by the lateral pre&s;&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXPERIMENTS OF 1784.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>68. <HI>Wedne&s;day, July</HI> 21, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 1784.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of la&s;t year's operations we experienced &s;everal incon|veniences from &s;ome parts of our apparatus, which we determined to remedy if po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e regarded chiefly the time-pieces, the axes of vibration, and the method of mea&s;uring by the tape. For mea&s;uring the time of a certain number of vibrations, we united the u&s;e of a &s;econd &s;top watch with a &s;imple half-&s;econd pendulum, made of a leaden bullet &s;u&s;pended by a &s;ilken thread, which did not always agree together. Again, the axes of the gun and pendulum frames were not found to be &s;o devoid of friction as might be wi&s;hed. But, above all, the chief cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction, was the method of mea&s;uring the extent of the vibrations by means of the tape; which was, notwith&s;tanding all po&s;|&s;ible care and precaution, &s;till &s;ubject to much irregularity, by being wetted by rain, or blown a&s;ide by the wind, or otherwi&s;e entangled, which rendered the mea&s;urements doubtful and irregular.</P>
<P>The preceding part of this year therefore was employed in correcting the&s;e and other &s;maller imperfections in the apparatus. To our time-pieces we added a peculiar one, which mea&s;ures time to 40th parts of a &s;econd.&mdash;Next, by a happy contrivance, the friction of the axes was almo&s;t intirely taken off. This was effected by means of &s;ockets of a peculiar con&s;truction, for the axes to work in. Fir&s;t imagine the half of a &s;hort cylinder, of 2 or 3 inches long, cut lengthways through the axis, and of a diameter a very little more than the ends of the axis that are intended to work in it: if this were all, it is evident that the axis, in
<PB N="187" REF="192">vibrating, would touch this &s;ocket in one line only, becau&s;e their diame|ters were unequal. Next imagine the in&s;ide of this &s;ocket to be gra|dually ground down towards each end, from nothing in the middle; &s;o that the in&s;ide re&s;embled a tube having its two ends bent downwards, and ri&s;ing highe&s;t in the middle. Then it is evident that the axis will touch the &s;ocket in this one middle point only. And farther, the under &s;ides of the axis it&s;elf were ground a little, to bring the undermo&s;t line to an edge, &s;omething like the pivots of a &s;cale beam. The con&s;e|quence was, that the friction was not &s;en&s;ible in a great number of vi|brations; and hereafter we commonly made the gun and pendulum vibrate for ju&s;t 10 minutes, and divided the counted number of vibra|tions by 10, for the mean number per minute&mdash;And for mea&s;uring the arcs of vibration more certainly and accurately, we have con&s;tructed a &s;trong wooden circular arch, of about 4 feet in length, cut out to a radius of ju&s;t 10 feet. This arch is divided into chords of equal parts, each the 1000th part of the radius, or 12/100th parts of an inch, as before de&s;cribed in Art. 16. This arch being placed 10 feet below, and con|centric with the axis, and the groove in the middle of it filled with the &s;oft compo&s;ition of &s;oap and wax, the &s;tylette, or &s;mall &s;harp &s;pear, traces in the groove the extent of the vibration, and the corre&s;ponding divi&s;ions on each &s;ide of the groove &s;hew the length of the chord vibra|ted. And as the&s;e chords are in 1000th parts of the radius, the value of <HI>r,</HI> in the theorem for the velocity of the ball, will be 1000 for all the following experiments; and then that theorem will become <HI>v</HI> &equals; 59/96 &times; <HI>p</HI>&plus;<HI>b</HI>/<HI>bin gc</HI> by the pendulum, and <HI>v</HI> &equals; 59/96 &times; G<HI>gc</HI>/<HI>bin</HI> by the recoil of the gun. Or <HI>v</HI> &equals; 12.742 &times; <HI>c / b</HI> or 51/4 &times; <HI>c / b</HI> by the gun n^o 2, when we &s;ub&s;titute the values of G, <HI>g, i, n,</HI> &s;pecified in Art. 36. And farther, when <HI>b</HI> &equals; 1.047, it is <HI>v</HI> &equals; 12&frac16;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="193">The apparatus having been prepared, we employed the three days, July 21, July 26, and Augu&s;t 3, in hanging it up, and in weighing, mea&s;uring, and adju&s;ting all the parts, and trying them by firing a few rounds with powder only. The 4 rounds fired on the fir&s;t of tho&s;e days, of 4 ounces each, with the gun n^o 1, weighing 917 lb, gave 56 at the fir&s;t round, and at each of the other three 57 divi&s;ions on the mea&s;uring arc, for the recoil of the gun.</P>

<P>Here, and in all the future days, the chords of vibration, of both gun and pendulum, are expre&s;&s;ed in 1000th parts of the radius.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194">The GUN was n^o 1.&mdash;We began this day with the weight of the gun and its iron frame only, without any of the leaden weights. Then the one &s;et of weights was put on at n^o 10, and the other at n^o 12. This was done to try the effects of different weights of gun on the velocity of the ball, experimentally to correct a common error which had been adopted from time immemorial, by profe&s;&s;ional men, namely, that heavier guns, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> give the greater velocities. The erroneou&s;ne&s;s of which opinion is proved by the experiments of this and &s;ome of the fol|lowing days. And it is needle&s;s to prove <HI>a priori</HI> to &s;cientific men, that the difference in the effects cannot be rendered &s;en&s;ible by any mea&s;ure|ments which we can make of the velocity.</P>
<P>The PENDULUM was the block of la&s;t year, with a new core, and a facing of &s;heet lead. Its weight, taken this morning, was 627 lb.</P>
<P>The plugs weighed 7 ounces to 11 inches, on an average; which proportion may always be u&s;ed in future, at lea&s;t till another be mentioned.</P>
<P>The 8th n^o is doubtful, and is omitted in the medium.</P>
<P>The 14th was with powder only, like the fir&s;t &s;ix. And the 15th was without ball, having only a wad made of junk, weighing 10z 10dr. This made a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion, of about half an inch deep, in the face of the pendulum, and rebounded back. And it &s;truck the pendulum at more than 6 inches above the line of direction.</P>
<P>Note, the center of the pendulum, as before, is at 88.7 inches below the axis. And the value of <HI>i,</HI> for the mean di&s;tance of the points &s;truck, is 88.4.</P>
<P>By comparing together the fir&s;t 6 rounds, which are all with the &s;ame weight of gun, we find that the mean proportion of the recoil, with the different charges, without balls, is as follows:

<P>The GUN, n^o 3, with the u&s;ual leads, weighed 917 lb.</P>

<P>The PENDULUM, as left hanging &s;ince the la&s;t day.</P>
<P>The value of <HI>i,</HI> or the mean among the points &s;truck the&s;e la&s;t three days, 88.5.</P>
<P>The object of this day's bu&s;ine&s;s, was to try the effect of different de|grees of ramming the charge of powder, with the effect of wads placed
<PB N="193" REF="198">in different po&s;itions. Sometimes the powder was only &s;et up without being compre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes it was rammed with a different number of &s;trokes, and pu&s;hed with various degrees of force: but no &s;en&s;ible difference was produced in the velocity. The wads, which were of 2 inches length, firmly made of junk or rope-yarn, and made large to be with difficulty pu&s;hed into the gun, were diver&s;ly placed and varied in number, being &s;ometimes introduced between the powder and ball, and &s;ometimes over both. But no effect was perceived from them on the velocity of the ball; this being indifferently the &s;ame, either with one wad, or two, or none at all. The rea&s;on of which is probably becau&s;e the balls had very little windage. At the la&s;t two numbers two wads were u&s;ed; in mo&s;t of the others only one; weighing on an average about 2 oz 9 dr.</P>
<P>When balls were u&s;ed with the wads, it was common for them both to enter the pendulum by the &s;ame hole. But it is remarkable that, when the wads were di&s;charged without balls, they commonly &s;truck wide of the line of the gun by 6 or 8 inches, and indifferently either too high or too low, or to the right or left; and &s;ometimes they flew in pieces before they &s;truck the block.</P>
<P>The velocities of the ball in the&s;e experiments are not computed, as the effects of the blow from the ball and the wad are compounded to|gether, and that in an unknown degree, as the wad &s;ometimes &s;lies in pieces, and &s;ometimes not, or &s;trikes the pendulum with divers degrees of force at different times; and al&s;o &s;ometimes the wads enter the pen|dulum, and &s;ometimes they rebound from it.</P>

<P>The object this day was the effect of windage with low balls, and the effect of wads, both high and low ones. The wads &s;truck variou&s;ly, either above or below or with the ball.

<P N="73">73. The PENDULUM block had not been altered &s;ince the la&s;t day's experiments. But the iron &s;tays of the &s;tem had been changed for others that are &s;tronger, and which weigh 10 lb more than the old ones did. And this additional 10 lb of iron mu&s;t be added to the weight of the pendulum; and new theorems mu&s;t be made out for determining the change in the center of gravity and the number of vibrations per minute. Now this rod, of uniform thickne&s;s, reached from the lower &s;ide of the axis to within 24 inches of the top of the block; con&s;e|quently its length was 51.4 inches, and its middle point, or center of gravity, was at 26.6 inches below the middle of the axis of vibration. And this number 26.6 will be the value of <HI>i</HI> in the theorem <GAP DESC="math"> for the place of the new center of gravity, where the value of <HI>b</HI> is 10; which theorem gives G &equals; 77.3 &minus; 0.76 &equals; 76.54 for the center of gravity.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame values of <HI>i</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> &s;ub&s;tituted in the theorem <GAP DESC="math">, give N &equals; 40.2 &plus; .07 &equals; 40.27 for the number of o&s;cillations.</P>
<P>Hence then, in this new &s;tate of the pendulum, the value of <HI>g</HI> is 76.54, and the value of <HI>n</HI> 40.27, corre&s;ponding to the value 670 of <HI>p,</HI> or weight of the pendulum. That is

<P>The GUN was n^o 1, weighing, with the u&s;ual leads, 917 lb.</P>
<P>The PENDULUM as left hanging &s;ince ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>The mean value of <HI>i,</HI> for the la&s;t two days, is 88.91.</P>
<P>After the experiments were ended this day, the pendulum was weighed, and found to be 706 lb. Now the original weight, when weighed at fir&s;t on the 26th of July, &s;eemingly with as much care as now, was 627 lb; to this add 61&frac12; lb weight of balls and plugs lodged in it, and 10 lb of iron added on the 8th of Augu&s;t, and they make together 698&frac12; lb; from this take 1.6 lb, for the diminution of the leaden facing
<PB N="198" REF="203">of the pendulum, by the balls &s;triking and piercing it, and there will remain only 697 lb, which the pendulum ought to weigh, and which is 9 lb le&s;s than it is actually found to weigh. I cannot imagine any cau&s;e to which this difference of weight may be attributed, as it is contrary to the effect heretofore experienced, the pendulum having always been found to lo&s;e in weight by hanging up; unle&s;s it ari&s;e from the moi&s;ture imbibed by the block in the 17 days it was up, and during all or the mo&s;t part of which time it was very rainy weather, and the pendulum hung uncovered. And the probability of this will be heightened by con&s;idering that the block had lain by all the preceding winter, and till after mid&s;ummer this year, under cover, in the carpenter's &s;hop, a cir|cum&s;tance which would make it very dry, and &s;o render it apt to im|bibe moi&s;ture from the continually foggy atmo&s;phere and rain which have taken place ever &s;ince it was expo&s;ed. This increa&s;e of weight then, being 9 lb in the 17 days, or nearly half a pound per day, I have thought it &s;afe&s;t to divide equally among all the days, by adding half a pound for each day it hung up, from the beginning of this year to the end of this day's experiments.</P>
<P>The object of this cour&s;e was again to &s;earch out the maximum of the gun's charge; but it is not a good &s;et of experiments, the velocities being not regular, perhaps owing to the bad &s;tate of the pendulum, which was very much &s;hattered. However it &s;ufficiently appears that there is but little difference among the velocities due to 8, 10, 12, and 14 ounces of powder.</P>

<P>Since the la&s;t experiments, the &s;teadying-rods of the gun-frame having been lengthened, and the pendulum block repaired with a new core, &amp;c. we attended to weigh and mea&s;ure the &s;everal parts; the circum|&s;tances of which were as follows:

<P>By this additional 17 lb weight of iron, the values of <HI>g</HI> and <HI>n,</HI> or the center of gravity and number of o&s;cillations, will be altered; which will cau&s;e an alteration in our theorem <HI>v</HI> &equals; 59/96 &times; G<HI>gc</HI>/<HI>bin,</HI> by which the ve|locity of the ball is determined from the recoil of the gun, in Art. 36.

<P>Now the old and new iron &s;tay-rods were nearly of equal thickne&s;s. But the old rods extended only 29 inches, and the new ones 58 inches below the axis; the difference is 29; and the half difference, or 14&frac12; added to the old length 29, gives 43&frac12; inches below the axis, where the
<PB N="200" REF="205">middle or center of gravity of the additional length is &s;ituated, the weight of which part is 17 lb. But the center of gravity was found to be 80.47 below the axis, when the whole weight was 917 lb. Here, the difference of the two di&s;tances, or the di&s;tance between the two weights 17 and 917, being 37 inches, and the &s;um of the weights 934, we &s;hall have 934 &ratio; 17 &proportion; 37 &ratio; 0.67 the change of the di&s;tance of the center of gravity; which being &s;ubtracted from 80.47, leaves 79.8 for the di&s;tance of the new compound center of gravity.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the correction of the value of <HI>n</HI> will be determined by the u&s;ual formula <GAP DESC="math">, in which <HI>b</HI> &equals; 17, <HI>i</HI> &equals; 43.5, <HI>n</HI> &equals; 40.0, <HI>p</HI> &equals; 917, and <HI>g</HI> &equals; 80.47; which values, being u&s;ed in that formula, give 0.1 for the correction of <HI>n;</HI> to which add 40.0, and we &s;hall have 40.1 for the new value of <HI>n,</HI> or number of o&s;cillations per minute, for the gun n^o 2; and con&s;e|quently 40.2 for n^o 1, and 40.0 for n^o 3, and 39.9 for n^o 1.

<P>Here the decrea&s;e of the velocity is uniformly ob&s;ervable with the decrea&s;e of weight in the ball, and that in a very con&s;iderable degree, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, which it ought to do, if the windage were the &s;ame, or the balls had the &s;ame diameter, and that in the reciprocal &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the weight of the ball. Now that ratio is the ratio of &radic;15&frac18; to &radic;16&frac78;, or of 11 to 11 7/11. Therefore as 11 &ratio; 11 7/11 &proportion; 1346 &ratio; 1424 the velocity the lea&s;t ball would have had, if its diameter had been equal to the heavie&s;t. But its velocity was actually no more than 1225; and therefore the difference 199, or 1/7 of the whole, or 1/6 of the experimented velocity, is the velocity lo&s;t by the difference of windage; although this difference was only 1/10 of an inch, or 1/20 of the caliber, which is no more than the u&s;ual windage allowed in &s;ervice. But the force, or inflamed powder, lo&s;t by the &s;ame cau&s;e, will be 2/7, or a double part of the velocity, becau&s;e the velocity is as the &s;quare of the force or quantity of powder. Hence then, in charges with 4 ounces of powder, and a windage of 1/20 of the caliber, 2/7 of the charge is lo&s;t, or nearly a mean between &frac13; and &frac14;.</P>
<P>And if the computation be made in like manner for the above charges of 8 ounces of powder, it will be found that the part of the charge lo&s;t by the &s;ame windage, will be, in the ca&s;e of 8 ounces, 4/13 of the whole; which is &s;till more than the &frac14; part, though &s;omewhat le&s;s than in the ca&s;e of 4 ounces. The rea&s;on of which is, that the ball is &s;ooner out of the gun with the 8 oz charge, and &s;o the fluid has le&s;s time to e&s;cape in.</P>

The PENDULUM as left ye&s;terday, except that it had received a &s;trengthening &s;trap of iron, weighing 7 lb 13&frac12; oz, which, reduced to its center of gravity, is placed at 79 inches below the axis. With this &s;trap it weighed this morning, before the experiments commenced, 683 lb; which is 6.2 lb le&s;s than it ought to be by adding all the balls and plugs to the fir&s;t weight; of which 6.2 lb difference, about 1.6 lb is for wa&s;te of the leaden facing, and the re&s;t 4.6 lb is probably by evapo|ration: and as the time the pendulum has hung up is 11 days, the rate

<P>N^o 13 is very doubtful, the vibration of the pendulum being evi|dently too large; perhaps 174 had been &s;et down in&s;tead of 164.</P>
<P>In the above there &s;eems to be &s;ome &s;mall advantage in favour of the wads. But I &s;u&s;pect the difference is only accidental; and the num|ber of experiments is too &s;mall to afford any tolerably good mediums.</P>

<P>The PENDULUM had had its band repaired, which did not how|ever alter its weight. The whole weighed this morning 733&frac12; lb. Now the weight of the balls and plugs in the la&s;t 5 days is 62 lb, which, being added to 683 lb, the weight of the pendulum on September 21, it makes 745 lb, which is 11&frac12; lb more than it weighed this morning. For this defect I know of no cau&s;e but evaporation: for in this time there was no wa&s;te of leaden facing, as the other end of the block was u&s;ed, which was not covered with lead. The time in which this 11&frac12; lb was lo&s;t is 20 days, which is nearly at the rate of &frac12; a pound each day. This defect is therefore divided equally among all the days.</P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENTS IN 1785.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiment">
<P N="87">87. SEVERAL of the experiments of the two former years being not &s;o regular as might be wi&s;hed, we have again under|taken to repeat &s;ome of them, and to add &s;till more to the &s;tock already obtained, that the mediums upon the whole may be tolerably exact, the great number of repetitions counteracting the unavoidable &s;mall irregu|larities, and deviations from the truth, in experiments in&s;tituted upon &s;o large a &s;cale. For this purpo&s;e we begin with the gun n^o 2, and u&s;e charges of 8 ounces of powder; and have formed the re&s;olution of firing every &s;hot into a fre&s;h and &s;ound part of the block of wood, and changing the block very frequently, before it become too much bat|tered, that the penetration of the ball and the force of the blow may be obtained with the greater degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o propo&s;ed to procure &s;ome good ranges, to compare them with the initial velocities made under the &s;ame circum&s;tances; from the compari&s;on of which we may e&s;timate the effects of the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, and &s;o lay a foundation for a new theory of gunnery. It is rather difficult to obtain with accuracy &s;uch long ranges as our initial velocities would produce, being from 1 mile to 2 miles, when the projection is made at an angle of 45 degrees; for in &s;uch long ranges our &s;mall balls cannot be &s;een, when they fall to the ground. We were obliged therefore to have recour&s;e to the water, in which the fall of the ball can be much better perceived; becau&s;e the plunge of the ball in the water, breaking the &s;urface and throwing it up, makes the place vi&s;ible at a great di&s;tance. But then another difficulty occurs, how to obtain exactly the di&s;tance of the fall, or length of the range, as the mark
<PB N="217" REF="222">made in the &s;urface of the water is vi&s;ible but for a moment. This difficulty however, our &s;ituation at Woolwich, clo&s;e by the river Thames, enabled us to overcome, as well as afforded us a good length of range. For at our &s;ituation in the Warren, the river makes a re|markable turn, and forms below us the part called the Gallions Reach, a map of which is here given in plate IV. In this map, A denotes the point where the guns were placed, being the Convicts' Wharf, which is &s;o called becau&s;e it is there that the convicts, or felons condemned to work on the river Thames, land their gravel, and upon which they u&s;ually labour. From this point we have a convenient range of about a mile and a half towards B, in the county of E&s;&s;ex, where there is a private or merchant's powder magazine. The buildings near C con&s;i&s;t of the academy and a noble range of &s;tore-hou&s;es; and from this point we &s;hould have had a &s;till longer and more convenient range, had not our view from hence been interrupted by four large hulks, which lie, for the u&s;e of the convicts, in the river oppo&s;ite the part between this point and the point A. Having found this convenient &s;ituation for our operations, we made an exact &s;urvey and map of the two &s;ides of the river, both ways beyond the extent of the ranges; and fixed on con|venient &s;tations at D and E on the &s;outh &s;ide, and F and G on the north &s;ide of the river, to place two parties of ob&s;ervers, who might mark the place where each ball &s;hould fall in the water, as well as note down the time employed by the ball in flying through the air, from the vi&s;ible di&s;charge of the gun to the plunge of the ball in the water. The method of determining the place of the fall was this: Two parties of ob&s;ervers, con&s;i&s;ting of three or four &s;teady and intelligent young gentlemen in each party, having taken their &s;tands at D and F, or E and G, according to the expected length of the range, carefully watched the di&s;charge of every ball from the gun at A; then tracing it, as it were, through the air by the loud whizzing noi&s;e it made in its &s;light, their eye was prepared and directed gradually towards the place of the fall, which they &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed of ob&s;erving. Then immediately
<PB N="218" REF="223">on perceiving the plunge, &s;ome of them noted the time of flight, by a good &s;top watch, while others ob&s;erved &s;ome remarkable land object on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, and directly in a line with the place in the water where the ball fell. This done, they directed the tele&s;cope or &s;ights of an in&s;trument, &s;uch as a theodolite or plain table, to that object, and noted the po&s;ition of it. This being done by each party of ob&s;ervers, and the line of po&s;ition from each &s;tation drawn on the plan, afterwards at lei&s;ure, the inter&s;ection of tho&s;e lines gave very exactly the place of the fall, and con&s;equently its di&s;tance from the gun. In this manner then were determined all the ranges and times of flight regi&s;tered in the following experiments; tho&s;e places being left blank where the ob|&s;ervation was either doubtful, or not made at all. The times of flight were al&s;o &s;ometimes ob&s;erved at the gun it&s;elf, where the plunge of the ball could often be perceived.</P>
<P>In this map of the river in plate IV, the dotted line on each &s;ide of the river denotes low-water mark; the fir&s;t black line next without it denotes high-water mark; and the other, or outermo&s;t line, is the land bank which has been rai&s;ed in former ages, from Greenwich for many miles below, and with immen&s;e labour, to prevent the waters of the river from overflowing the adjacent fields, which it would do every tide, as they lie low and are otherwi&s;e very mar&s;hy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>88. <HI>Wedne&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 31, 1785.</HEAD>
<P>EMPLOYED this day in making part of the &s;urvey by the &s;ide of the river, for forming the map, and fixing the &s;tations proper for the parties of ob&s;ervers to occupy, in watching the fall of the balls in the river; and for other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224">We weighed and mea&s;ured the pendulum, which had been prepared in a very complete manner, and with &s;tronger bands than before. It weighed ju&s;t 795 lb. And, by a mean of &s;everal times balancing and vibrating, we found 78&frac13; inches to be the di&s;tance of the center of gravity below the axis, and 40.07 the number of o&s;cillations per minute.</P>
<P>After executing part of the &s;urvey by the &s;ide of the river, we fired a few balls upon the water, from the Convicts' or Proof Wharf, to try whereabouts they will fall, and thereby to judge of the proper places for the ob&s;ervers to be &s;tationed at. The gun was n^o 2, with 8 ounces of powder, and was tried at different elevations. When the gun was elevated at 45 degrees, the balls ranged much too far, going beyond the &s;tretch of the river, and falling on the coa&s;t of E&s;&s;ex below the point B. But at 15 degrees elevation, the balls ranged to a very convenient di&s;tance, namely, a little more than a mile. And their fall in the water could be very well &s;een from the &s;ide of the river nearly oppo&s;ite the place of the fall, and &s;ometimes from the gun it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion I took out with me, and employed the fir&s;t cla&s;s of Gentlemen Cadets belonging to the Royal Military Academy, namely, Me&s;&s;ieurs Bartlett, Rowley, De Butts, Bryce, Wm. Fenwick, Pilkington, Edridge, and Watkins, who have gone through the &s;cience of fluxions, and have applied it to &s;everal important con&s;iderations in natural philo&s;ophy. Tho&s;e gentlemen I have voluntarily offered and undertaken to introduce to the practice of the&s;e intere&s;ting experiments, with the application of the theory of them, which they have before &s;tudied under my care. For, although it be not my academy duty, I am de&s;irous of doing this for their benefit, and as much as po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;i&s;t the eager and diligent &s;tudies of &s;o learned and amiable a cla&s;s of young gentle|men; who, as well as the whole body of &s;tudents now in the upper academy, form the be&s;t &s;et of young men I ever knew in my life; nay, I did not think it even po&s;&s;ible, in our &s;tate of &s;ociety in this country, for &s;uch a number of gentlemen to exi&s;t together in the con&s;tant daily
<PB N="220" REF="225">habits of &s;o much regularity and good manners; their behaviour being indeed perfectly exemplary, and the pure effect of true philo&s;ophical principles, ari&s;ing from a rational conviction of the propriety of a regu|lar good conduct, which is &s;uch as would do honour to the pure&s;t and mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of &s;ociety that ever exi&s;ted in the world: and I have no he&s;itation in predicting the great honour, and future &s;ervices, which will doubtle&s;s be rendered to the &s;tate by &s;uch eminent in&s;tances of virtue and abilities.</P>

<P>WENT out again with the &s;ame cla&s;s of eight young gentlemen, to complete the &s;urvey of the river &s;ide. The weather changed to rain after we were out, which continued the whole time, and to &s;uch a de|gree as to wet us intirely through all our clothes.

<P>The GUN was n^o 2. It was not hung on an axis, as in the two former years, but mounted on a &s;mall carronade carriage, made for the
<PB N="222" REF="227">purpo&s;e, both in the la&s;t 6 rounds, which were fired down the river, and in the fir&s;t 8 rounds, which were fired into the new pendulum, at the &s;ame di&s;tance as formerly, or about 35 feet, and each ball into a fre&s;h part of the wood, both to obtain the force of the blow the more accu|rately, and to take the penetration of the ball in the &s;olid wood, which we did every time by pu&s;hing in a wire to touch the hinder part of the ball: the&s;e penetrations are various, according as the part &s;truck was more or le&s;s compact, and they are rather larger than was expected, the medium of all being 18 4/10, although the block of elm, as the carpen|ters a&s;&s;ured us, was &s;ound, dry, and well-&s;ea&s;oned wood. The penetra|tions are &s;et down in the la&s;t column, and are for the fore part of the balls, the diameter having been always added to the length of the wire.</P>
<P>The POWDER was not of the &s;ame parcel as the two former years; but it was from the &s;ame maker, and made as nearly &s;imilar to the former as might be. The charges were gently &s;et home, and all circum&s;tances made alike. The mean length of the charge of 8 oz was 4.84.</P>
<P>The PENDULUM had been kept clo&s;e covered with a painted canvas cloth &s;ince the fir&s;t day that it was weighed and mea&s;ured, to pre&s;erve it from the weather. The plugs weighed 9 ounces to every 11 inches in length; the whole weight of all the plugs, together with that of the 8 balls, make up 13 lb, wanting only an ounce and a half; and when the pendulum was taken down and weighed this afternoon, its weight was found to be 808 lb, which is ju&s;t 13 lb more than its weight at fir&s;t. So that it has neither lo&s;t weight by evaporation, nor gained by imbibing moi&s;ture: owing, probably, to the circum&s;tance of being covered by the painted canvas.&mdash;All the apparatus was in good order, and the experiments all very accurately made.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the&s;e experiments, the values of <HI>p, g, n,</HI> being <HI>p</HI> &equals; 795, <HI>g</HI> &equals; 78&frac13;, <HI>n</HI> &equals; 40.07; if the&s;e values be &s;ub&s;tituted in the two theorems
<PB N="223" REF="228"><GAP DESC="math"> <GAP DESC="math"> for the correction of <HI>g</HI> and <HI>n,</HI> they become <GAP DESC="math"> <GAP DESC="math"> or <GAP DESC="math"> nearly. And by the&s;e theorems the numbers in the columns <HI>g</HI> and <HI>n</HI> are made out, the mean value of <HI>i,</HI> or point &s;truck, being 90.1.</P>
<P>The la&s;t 6 rounds were fired down the river from the Convicts' or Proof Wharf at A, and the place of the fall ob&s;erved by two parties of the cadets, &s;tationed at D and E. The gun had 15 degrees elevation. The fall of the fir&s;t only could be &s;een at the gun, where the time of flight was ob&s;erved by a &s;top watch, and found to be 14 &s;econds. The two parties of ob&s;ervers at D and E had no time-piece with them, &s;o that the other times of flight could not be ob&s;erved. The medium range is 5916 feet or 1972 yards. The la&s;t two balls went clo&s;e over the heads, and fell ju&s;t beyond, the lower party of ob&s;ervers, at E; yet not|with&s;tanding their imminent danger, they gallantly re&s;olved to keep their ground, if any more rounds &s;hould be fired, not knowing imme|diately that we intended not firing any more at that time. The&s;e two rounds were probably de&s;lected thus a little from their cour&s;e by the u&s;ual cau&s;es of deviation. And perhaps the two former rounds had been &s;till farther deflected, and thrown on the land, as the ob&s;ervers &s;aw nothing of them. But the gun was pointed in a direction rather nearer this &s;outh &s;ide of the river.</P>

<P>The&s;e 7 rounds were fired down the river from the &s;ame place as before; the elevation of the gun being 15 degrees, and all other circum|&s;tances the &s;ame as before. The gun was pointed nearly to the middle of the river; yet the balls fell mo&s;tly wide of the direction, and that both ways, &s;ome falling near one &s;ide of the river, and &s;ome near the other, though there was not the lea&s;t wind. The times of flight were taken with a &s;top watch, at the lower &s;tation of ob&s;ervers at E, by noting the time between &s;eeing the fla&s;h of the gun and the plunge of the ball in the water. They run from 14 to 15&frac12; &s;econds, and accord very well with the ranges, the larger to the larger: the medium is 14.7 &s;econds; and the medium range 6216 feet, or 2072 yards. N^o 3 was not &s;een. The mean length of charge 4.8 inches.</P>
<P>The &s;ame parties of young gentlemen kept their &s;tation very gallantly, and make no he&s;itation in offering to attend and ob&s;erve there for the remainder of the experiments, although &s;ome of the balls this day again fell near them, and one indeed within 40 yards of them.</P>

<P>We fired the&s;e 4 rounds into the &s;ame pendulum as we left hanging on September 2, which had been kept under cover &s;ince that time. After the&s;e 4 rounds, it weighed 811 lb, which is 2&frac34; lb le&s;s than it ought to be when the weight of the 4 balls and plugs are added to its former weight, and which 2&frac34; lb it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t by evaporation in the cour&s;e of the 7 days, which was mo&s;tly dry, warm weather.</P>

The wood was moi&s;t within, as we di&s;covered by boring out the balls; but it was hard and firm of its kind, being in the root, or the root end after the body of the tree was &s;awed off from it. The penetrations are for the fore part of the ball, as u&s;ual.</P>

<P>The&s;e 8 were fired in the river, and ob&s;erved as before.</P>
<P>The GUN was n^o 3, and was elevated 15 degrees.</P>
<P>The ranges are again low, probably from the lightne&s;s of the balls.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual cau&s;es of deflection carried three of the balls, namely, the 1&s;t, 7th, and 8th, very near the &s;outh &s;tation at E; and then fell almo&s;t clo&s;e to the party there. In general it was ob&s;erved that the balls de|viate from their line of direction, or middle line of the river, to each &s;ide, by half the breadth of the river, or from 300 to 400 yards!</P>

<P><PB N="234" REF="239">The ranges were taken from ob&s;ervations, as before, at Duval's hou&s;e, and the fir&s;t gibbet. The fir&s;t 17 rounds were fired this year, with 2 ounces of powder, to complete the &s;eries of ranges at 15 degrees eleva|tion of the gun; and the la&s;t three rounds, with 4 ounces, to try if the powder was of the &s;ame &s;trength as before: and which, by comparing the&s;e three ranges with tho&s;e of la&s;t year, appears to be now &s;omewhat &s;tronger. So that the&s;e ranges and times, it may be pre&s;umed, are too great in re&s;pect of tho&s;e of la&s;t year. They are al&s;o evidently very irregular; owing perhaps to the inequalities of the balls, which were only the remaining outca&s;ts from the whole &s;tock we fir&s;t began with, having been rejected either from their lightne&s;s, or from the irregulari|ties of their &s;urfaces. And &s;ometimes indeed the ranges and times, here &s;et down, were not very accurately obtained. The mediums of all, except tho&s;e marked doubtful, are placed at the bottom.</P>

We are now therefore to make &s;ome u&s;e of the&s;e experiments, by pointing out the philo&s;ophical laws and deductions that flow from them, and making &s;uch other remarks as may be &s;ugge&s;ted by the va|rious circum&s;tances of them, or that may be u&s;eful for improving or farther extending experiments attended with &s;uch important con&s;equences in natural philo&s;ophy. And for the&s;e beneficial purpo&s;es, it will fir&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to bring the mediums and re&s;ults together into an ab&s;tract, or one comprehen&s;ive point of view; to form as it were the &s;ure and regular foundation for the future &s;tructure we hope to be able to rai&s;e upon them.</P>

Find then a medium among the&s;e unequal differences, by dividing their &s;um by the number of them, and it will be found to be 1.27, which &s;et in the 4th column of regular or equal differences. Then, as the numbers in the 3d column, the neare&s;t to this mean 1.27, are the differences between 6, 8, and 10 ounces, by &s;uppo&s;ing 5.66 to be the true length of the 8 ounce charge, I form all the others from it, by adding and &s;ubtracting continually the mean or common difference 1.27, and place them in the la&s;t column; which will therefore con&s;i&s;t of the true regular length of each charge, including both the powder and the neck of the flannel bag which con|tained it.</P>
<P>How much of each &s;pace was really occupied by the neck of the bag, may be thus &s;ound: the fir&s;t number 1.85 is the length of the
<PB N="238" REF="243">charge of 2 ounces, including the neck; and the common difference 1.27 is the real length of 2 ounces of powder in the bore; therefore, &s;ubtracting this number from the former, the remainder 0.58 is the mean length of the bore which was occupied by the neck of the bag in every charge. And, therefore, taking this number from each of tho&s;e in the la&s;t column, the remainders will &s;hew the real length of bore occupied by the powder alone in each of the charges.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE RECOIL WITHOUT BALLS.</HEAD>
<P N="105">105. NEXT let us con&s;ider the quantity of recoil, or extent of the vibration of each gun, for every charge of powder; and fir&s;t without balls. Now as the&s;e recoils were mea&s;ured &s;ometimes to one radius, and &s;ometimes to another, it will be proper to reduce them all to a common radius, as well as to a common weight of gun when it happens to vary in weight. In the fir&s;t year's experiments, the radius was various, and the chords of recoil were always taken in inches; but in tho&s;e of the &s;econd and third years, the radius was con&s;tantly 10 feet, or 120 inches, which was divided into 1000 equal parts, and the chords of vibration mea&s;ured in thou&s;andth parts of the radius, each part being 12/100 of an inch. It will therefore be convenient to reduce the recoils of the fir&s;t year, to the &s;ame radius and parts as tho&s;e of the other two years: which may be done as follows: Let <HI>r</HI> &equals; any radius of the fir&s;t year in inches, and <HI>c</HI> &equals; a corre&s;ponding chord of recoil taken in inches and parts.</P>
<P>Then <HI>r</HI> &ratio; 120 &proportion; <HI>c</HI> &ratio; 120<HI>c</HI>/<HI>r</HI> the chord corre&s;ponding to the ra|dius 120, and mea&s;ured in inches; and 120 &ratio; 1000 &proportion; 120<HI>c</HI>/<HI>r</HI> &ratio; 1000<HI>c</HI>/<HI>r</HI> the &s;ame chord as expre&s;&s;ed in thou&s;andth parts of 120 inches.</P>
<P>Hence then, to reduce any chord of recoil, in the fir&s;t year, multiply it by 1000, and divide the product by its own radius in inches; &s;o &s;hall
<PB N="239" REF="244">the quotient be the corre&s;ponding chord an&s;wering to the radius 120 inches, and expre&s;&s;ed in thou&s;andth parts of that radius.</P>
<P N="106">106. By the foregoing rule then having reduced all the chords of recoil to the radius 10 feet, and denoted them in thou&s;andth parts of that radius; the mediums of every day's experiments, collected and arranged, will be as below.</P>

<P>The recoils being e&s;timated in parts of which the radius is 1000 : and the common weight of the gun, with its frame and leaden weights, being 917 lb; al&s;o the di&s;tance of the center of gravity below the axis, and the number of vibrations per minute, as &s;et down in the 2d and 3d columns of the tablet above.</P>
<P N="107">107. From the view and con&s;ideration of the&s;e numbers, various ob|&s;ervations ea&s;ily ari&s;e. As fir&s;t, that, by ob&s;erving the four columns, or vertical rows, it appears that the recoil of the gun, and con&s;equently the force of the powder upon it, always increa&s;es as the length of the gun increa&s;es, and that in a manner tolerably regular as far as the charge of 8 ounces; but after that, the increa&s;e is fa&s;ter: thus, between the &s;horte&s;t bore of 28 inches long, and the longe&s;t of 80 inches, the increa&s;e in the velocity of recoil with 2 ounces of powder is from 22 to 25, or about the &frac18; part; with 4 ounces of powder, it is from 53 to 59, or the 1/9 part; and with 8 ounces of powder, it is from 117 to 129, or the 1/10 part; but with 16 ounces of powder, the increa&s;e is from 220 to 265, or the &frac15; part. And this increa&s;e of recoil is chiefly,
<PB N="241" REF="246">if not intirely, to be a&s;cribed to the longer time the fluid of the inflamed powder acts upon the gun, in pa&s;&s;ing through the greater length of bore; at lea&s;t as far as to the charge of 8 ounces: but the extraordinary increa&s;e in the ca&s;e of 16 ounces, &s;eems to be partly owing to that, and partly to &s;ome of the powder, in this high charge, being blown out unfired from the &s;hort gun. And from this circum&s;tance I would infer, that the whole of the charge of 8 ounces, without ball, is fired before it i&s;&s;ues from the mouth of the &s;hort gun, that is before the fluid expands through a &s;pace of 22&frac12; inches of bore. And hence, if the velocity of the fluid were known, we could a&s;&s;ign the time within which all the powder is fired. If, for in&s;tance, the mean velocity of the fluid were only 5000 feet in a &s;econd, though it is probably much more, the time would be only about the 250th part of a &s;econd in which the 8 ounces would be all inflamed.</P>
<P>The foregoing are the rates of increa&s;e in the chord of recoil, or in the velocity of the gun, which is proportional to it. It mu&s;t be re|marked however that the increa&s;e in the <HI>force</HI> of the powder will be about double of that of the recoil, becau&s;e the force is as the &s;quare of the velocity: &s;o that, from the &s;horte&s;t gun to the longe&s;t, the increa&s;e in the force of the powder with 2, 4, or 8 ounces, is about &frac14;, or from 4 to 5; and with 16 ounces of powder, the force is almo&s;t as 2 to 3, or the increa&s;e almo&s;t one half of the le&s;s force.</P>
<P N="108">108. Again, if we contemplate the numbers on each horizontal line, that is, the recoils of each gun &s;eparately, with the &s;everal charges of 2, 4, 8, and 16 ounces of powder, we &s;hall find that, in each of them, the recoil increa&s;es from the beginning, to a certain part, in a greater ratio than the con&s;tant ratio, 2 to 1, of the powder increa&s;es; and after|wards in a le&s;s ratio than that of the powder. That the ratio of the recoils, in every gun, is greate&s;t at fir&s;t, or with the lea&s;t charges of powder: that the ratio continually decrea&s;es as the charge increa&s;es: that the ratio, at fir&s;t, is greate&s;t with the &s;horte&s;t gun, and &s;o gradually
<PB N="242" REF="247">le&s;s and le&s;s all the way to the longe&s;t: but that, however, the ratio in the &s;horter guns decrea&s;e fa&s;ter than in the longer; and &s;o as to come &s;ooner to the ratio of 2 to 1 in the &s;horter guns than in the longer; and after that, the ratios in the &s;hort guns, with the &s;ame charge, are le&s;s than in the long ones. All the&s;e properties will perhaps appear &s;till plainer by arranging together the &s;everal ratios for each n^o of gun, as here below:

<HEAD>OF THE MEAN VELOCITY OF THE BALL FROM THE RECOIL OF THE GUN.</HEAD>
<P>III. HAVING determined the mean recoil of the guns, both with and without balls, for the charges of 2, 4, 8, 16 ounces; we can now a&s;&s;ign the mean velocity of the ball, for each gun and charge, from the recoils; if, as Robins has a&s;&s;erted, the force of the powder upon the gun be the &s;ame, whether it is fired with a ball or without one. For, if that property be generally true, then the velocity of the ball mu&s;t be propor|tional to the difference of the chords of recoil with and without a ball; and that difference being multiplied by a certain con&s;tant number, will give the velocity of the ball it&s;elf; as we have before &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Now if <HI>c</HI> denote the difference of tho&s;e chords, <HI>b</HI> the weight of the ball, G the weight of the gun, <HI>g</HI> the di&s;tance to its center of gravity, <HI>i</HI> the di&s;tance to the axis of the bore, and <HI>n</HI> the number of o&s;cillations the gun would make in a minute; then we have found, in Art. 68, that
<PB N="248" REF="253">59/96 &times; G<HI>gc</HI>/<HI>bin</HI> will expre&s;s the velocity of the ball. And that when G &equals; 917, <HI>g</HI> &equals; 80.47, <HI>i</HI> &equals; 89.15, and <HI>n</HI> &equals; 40, which are the medium values of tho&s;e letters, then the &s;ame theorem becomes 51/4 &times; <HI>c / b</HI> for the velocity of the ball. And, farther, when the mean value of <HI>b</HI> is 1.051 or 16 oz 13 dr, the &s;ame theorem for the velocity becomes barely 12 1/7<HI>c.</HI> Subtracting however the 700th part in the gun n^o 1, and ad|ding in the other three guns, as follows, namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>the 1000th part in n^o 2,</ITEM>
<ITEM>400th part in n^o 3,</ITEM>
<ITEM>300th part in n^o 4.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Therefore if each of the recoils without balls, in the la&s;t table of Art. 106, be taken from the corre&s;ponding recoils in Art. 109, and the re|mainders be multiplied by 12 1/7, making the additions and &s;ubtractions above-mentioned, we &s;hall have the corre&s;ponding velocities of the ball by this method. And a &s;ynop&s;is of the whole, for each gun and charge, will be as in the following table:

<P N="112">112. THE four following tables contain the mediums of the velocities of the balls, as computed for each day, for all the principal charges of powder, and for each gun &s;eparately; one table being allotted for each. In the&s;e tables all the mediums are arranged in a continued &s;eries, in the chronological order as they occurred, and accompanied with all the cir|cum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to be known; thus forming a fund or collection of elements, from which other arrangements and principles are to be deduced.</P>
<P>Each table con&s;i&s;ts of ten columns. The fir&s;t column contains the dates; the next three the &s;tate of the weather and air; namely, the 2d column the hygrometer, or &s;tate of the air as to dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture; the 3d the barometer; and the 4th the thermometer; both which la&s;t in&s;truments, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, were always placed in the &s;hade, and within the hou&s;e, while the experiments were made in the open air, where it was commonly much hotter than the degree &s;hewn by the ther|mometer. The 5th column contains the weight of the charge of powder; the 6th and 7th the weight and diameter of the ball; the 8th and 9th the velocity of the ball, the former as computed from the vibration of the pendulum, and the latter from the recoil of the gun; and finally the 10th column contains the difference between the&s;e two velocities, which is marked with the negative &s;ign (&minus;) when the velocity by the gun is the le&s;s of the two.</P>

<P N="113"><PB N="253" REF="258">113. The foregoing tables contain the &s;everal mediums of velocities, for each day, and for all varieties in the circum&s;tances of powder, and weight and diameter of ball. It will now then be proper to collect to|gether all the repetitions of the &s;ame charge or weight of powder, and to take the mediums of all tho&s;e mediums, to &s;erve as fixed radical numbers, or e&s;tabli&s;hed degrees of velocity, adapted to all the various charges of powder, and length of gun. And for this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall reduce the numbers of the&s;e tables all to one common weight and dia|meter of ball, namely, to the weight 16 oz 13 dr, and the diameter 1.96 inches, which are the numbers that mo&s;t commonly occur. And this reduction will be very well deduced from the experiments of September 11, 1784, when &s;everal trials were made with divers weights and diame|ters of ball, and with both 4 oz and 8 oz of powder, the re&s;ults of which accord very well together. In the experiments of that day, it was found that, with the 4 oz charges, 1/7 of the whole velocity is lo&s;t by the dif|ference of 1/10 of an inch in the diameter of the ball; and, with the 8 oz charge, 2/15 of the velocity is lo&s;t by the &s;ame difference of windage. But the quantity of inflamed fluid which e&s;capes, will be nearly as the difference between the area of the circle of the bore and the great circle of the ball, or the force will be as the &s;quare of the ball's diameter; and the velocity, we know, is as the &s;quare root of the force: and there|fore the velocity is as the diameter of the ball; and the difference in the velocity, as the difference of the diameter, or as the windage. Hence, if <HI>w</HI> denote any difference of windage in parts of an inch, or difference between 1.96 and the diameter of any ball, and 1/<HI>m</HI> the part of the experi|mented velocity lo&s;t by 1/10 of an inch difference of windage; then &s;hall 1/10 &ratio; <HI>w</HI> &proportion; 1/<HI>m</HI> &ratio; 10<HI>w</HI>/<HI>m,</HI> which la&s;t term will &s;hew what part of the ex|perimented velocity is lo&s;t by the increa&s;e of windage denoted by 10. By this rule then, I reduce all the velocities to what they would have been, had the diameter of the ball been always 1.96. It is to be noted
<PB N="254" REF="259">however, that the value of <HI>m</HI> will vary with the charge of powder: with 4 ounces of powder, it was found that 1/<HI>m</HI> was 1/7 of the whole velocity, or &frac16; of the experimented velocity; but with 8 oz of powder, 1/<HI>m</HI> was found to be 2/15 of the whole, or 2/13 of the experimented velocity. We &s;hall not be far from the truth therefore, if we take the following values of 1/<HI>m,</HI> to the &s;everal corre&s;ponding charges of powder; that is, as far as 16 oz in the guns n^o 3 and 4, and then returning backwards again as the powder is increa&s;ed above 16 oz, by 2 oz at a time; but in the gun n^o 2, to continue only to 14 oz, and then return backwards again for all above 14 oz; and for the gun n^o 1, to continue only to 12 oz, and then return backwards for all above that charge.</P>

<P>Such then is the reduction of the velocity on account of the windage. And as to that for the different weights of the ball, we know that the velocity varies in the reciprocal &s;ubduplicate ratio of the weight; and according to this rule the numbers were corrected on account of the different weights of ball. After the&s;e reductions then are made, the numbers in the foregoing tables, arranged under their re&s;pective charges of powder, will be as here below, for a ball of 1.96 diameter, and weighing 16 oz 13 dr.</P>

<P N="114">114. The&s;e la&s;t medium velocities, for each gun, will be tolerably
<PB N="256" REF="261">near the truth; and the more &s;o, commonly, as the number of the other mediums is the greater. For want, however, of a &s;ufficient number of each &s;ort, there are &s;ome &s;mall irregularities among the final mediums, which may be corrected, for the mo&s;t part, by adding or &s;ubtracting 3 or 4 feet, as they are &s;ometimes too little, and &s;ometimes too great. And the&s;e &s;mall deviations will be very ea&s;ily di&s;covered by dividing the mediums by each other, namely, each of the velocities for 4, 6, 8, &amp;c. ounces of powder, by that for 2 ounces. For we know, from the prin|ciples of forces, and other experiments, that the velocities will be nearly as the &s;quare roots of the quantities of powder; that is, while the length of the charge does not much &s;horten the length of the bore before the ball; but gradually deviating from that proportion more and more, as the charge of powder is increa&s;ed in length; becau&s;e the force has gra|dually a le&s;s di&s;tance and time to act upon the ball in. Now by dividing the quantities of powder 4, 6, 8, &amp;c. by 2, the quotients 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. &s;hew the ratios of the charges; and the roots of the&s;e numbers, namely,

<ITEM>&amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST> 
&s;hew the ratios which the velocities would have to each other nearly, if the empty part of the bore was always of the &s;ame length. But as the vacant part always decrea&s;es as the charge increa&s;es, the ratios of the velocities may be expected to fall &s;hort of tho&s;e above, and the &s;ooner and the more &s;o, as the gun is &s;horter. Accordingly, on trial, we find the ratios hold pretty well, even in the &s;horte&s;t gun, as far as to the 6oz charge; but in the 8oz charge it falls about 1/13 or 1/14 part below the true ratio, being 1.85 in&s;tead of 2. In the longer guns, the proportions hold out gradually longer, and the deviations are always le&s;s and le&s;s: thus, in the 2d gun, the ratio for the 8oz charge is about 1.895, in the 3d it is 1.945, and in the 4th gun it is 1.999 or 2 very nearly. And &s;o for other charges. Correcting then &s;ome of the mediums by

</TABLE> where the numbers are here placed in horizontal lines, which before were vertical; and vertical here, tho&s;e which before were horizontal. And where the law, both of the ratios and differences, is evident. We al&s;o hence perceive how, for each charge, the velocity of the ball is continually increa&s;ed as the gun is longer.</P>
<P>And the&s;e velocities may be con&s;idered as &s;tandard radical numbers, here depo&s;ited, and ready to be applied to any purpo&s;e, in which the con&s;ideration of the velocity can be u&s;eful. And tho&s;e for the other charges of powder will be as in the general table in Art. 113.</P>
<P N="115"><PB N="258" REF="263">115. The&s;e velocities however, it mu&s;t be remarked, are tho&s;e with which the ball &s;trikes the pendulum, after pa&s;&s;ing through the air be|tween it and the muzzle of the gun; and con&s;equently they are le&s;s than the velocities with which it immediately i&s;&s;ues from the gun, by as much velocity as the ball lo&s;es by the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, in its flight through that &s;pace. Now we have found, in Art. 33, that the fir&s;t velocities lo&s;e at lea&s;t their 84th part by that re&s;i&s;tance, when the air behind the ball is &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;tantly to fill up the place always quitted by the ball in its flight. But as this is not exactly the ca&s;e, the air ru&s;hing into a vacuum with a certain finite velocity, therefore the part lo&s;t will be gra|dually more and more as the ball moves &s;wifter, till its velocity become equal to that of the air it&s;elf; after which the part lo&s;t will remain con|&s;tant. And Mr. Robins a&s;&s;erts that the velocity lo&s;t by very &s;wift motions, is about 3 times as great as that lo&s;t by &s;low ones; and there|fore that will be about the 28th part. So that the lo&s;s will always lie between the 84th part and the 28th part. I &s;hall therefore leave it in this uncertain &s;tate, till other experiments enable us to a&s;certain what may be the exact proportion of lo&s;s peculiar to every degree of velocity.</P>
<P N="116">116. From the general table of medium velocities in Art. 113, it is evident that, for each gun, the velocity increa&s;es with the charge to a certain extent, where it is greate&s;t; and that afterwards it gradually decrea&s;es as the charge is increa&s;ed. It farther appears that the point, or charge, at which the velocity is the greate&s;t, is different in the guns of different lengths; the charge which gives the maximum of velocity, being always greater, as the gun is longer. And by tracing this increa&s;e of charge, from the beginning, to the point of greate&s;t velocity, it ap|pears that, with the 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d guns, the charges which give the greate&s;t velocities, are nearly as follows, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>Gun n^o 1 at the charge of 12oz,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Gun n^o 2 at the charge of 14oz,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Gun n^o 3 at the charge of 16oz.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="264">Here it will not be &s;o proper to &s;pecify what portion of the weight of the ball the&s;e weights of powder are; being no ways regulated by that circum&s;tance; but what portion of the bore of the gun is filled with the&s;e quantities of powder. Now, by the table of the lengths of charges in Art. 104, it appears that the lengths of the charges of 12, 14, and 16oz, are the&s;e, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>12oz 8.20 inches; gun 1, its length 28.2</ITEM>
<ITEM>14oz 9.5 inches; gun 2 its length 38.1</ITEM>
<ITEM>16oz 10.7 inches; gun 3 its length 57.4</ITEM>
</LIST> Then dividing each length of charge by its corre&s;ponding length of gun, we obtain nearly the&s;e three following fractions, viz.
<LIST>

<P>In this table, the fir&s;t column &s;hews the number of the gun; and its velocity of ball, both by the vibration of the gun and pendulum, with their differences, is on the &s;ame line with it, for the &s;everal charges of powder. After the fir&s;t column, the re&s;t of the page is divided into four &s;paces, for the four charges, 2, 4, 8, 16 ounces; and each of the&s;e is divided into three columns: in the fir&s;t of the three, is the velocity of the ball as determined from the vibration of the gun; in the &s;econd is the ball as determined from the vibration of the pendulum; and in the third is the difference between the two, which is marked with the negative &s;ign, or &minus;, when the former velocity is le&s;s than the latter, otherwi&s;e it is po&s;itive.</P>
<P N="119">119. From the compari&s;on contained in the la&s;t article, it appears, in general, that the velocities, determined by the two different ways, do not
<PB N="262" REF="267">agree together; and that therefore the method of determining the ve|locity of the ball from the recoil of the gun, is not generally true, although Mr. Robins and Mr. Thomp&s;on had &s;u&s;pected it to be &s;o; and con&s;equently that the effect of the inflamed powder on the recoil of the gun, is not exactly the &s;ame when it is fired without a ball, as when it is fired with one. It al&s;o appears that this difference is no ways regular, neither in the different guns with the &s;ame charge, nor in the &s;ame gun with different charges of powder. That with very &s;mall charges, the velocity by the gun is greater than that by the pendulum; but that the latter always gains upon the former, and &s;oon becomes equal to it; and then exceeds it more and more as the charge of powder is increa&s;ed. That the particular charge, at which the two velocities become equal, is different in the different guns; and that this charge is le&s;s, or the equality &s;ooner takes place, as the gun is longer. And all this, whether we u&s;e the actual velocity with which the ball &s;trikes the pendulum, or the &s;ame increa&s;ed by the velocity lo&s;t by the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, in its flight from the gun to the pendulum.</P>

</LIST> And the&s;e penetrations are nearly as the numbers 2, 4, 6, or 1, 2, 3; but the quantities of powder are as 2, 4, 8, or 1, 2, 4; &s;o that the penetrations are as the charges as far as 4 ounces, but in a le&s;s ratio at 8 ounces, namely, le&s;s in the ra|tio of 3 to 4. And are indeed, &s;o far, proportional to the logarithms of the charges.</P>
<P>Now, by the theory of penetrations, the depths ought to be as the charges, or, which is the &s;ame thing, as the &s;quares of the velocities. But from our experiments it appears that the penetrations fall &s;hort of that proportion in the higher charges. And therefore it would &s;eem, that the re&s;i&s;ting force of the wood is not uniformly the &s;ame; but that it increa&s;es a little with the increa&s;ed velocity of the ball. And this probably may be occa&s;ioned by the greater quantity of fibres driven be|fore the ball; which may thus increa&s;e the &s;pring or re&s;i&s;tance of the wood, and &s;o prevent the ball from penetrating &s;o deep as it otherwi&s;e would do. But it will require &s;arther experiments in &s;uture to deter|mine this point more accurately.</P>
<P N="124"><PB N="266" REF="271">124. Before we conclude this tract, it may not be unu&s;eful to make a &s;hort recapitulation of the more remarkable deductions that have been drawn from the experiments, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e calculations. For by bringing them together into one collected point of view, we may, at any time, ea&s;ily &s;ee what u&s;eful points of knowledge are hereby obtained, and thence be able to judge what remains yet to be done by future experiments. Having therefore experimented and examined all the objects that were pointed out in art. 5, p. 104, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> we &s;hall ju&s;t &s;lightly mention the an&s;wers to the&s;e enquiries; which are either addi|tions to, or confirmations of, tho&s;e laid down p. 102, as drawn from our former experiments in the year 1775.</P>
<P>And 1&s;t, then, it may be remarked that the former law, between the charge and velocity of ball, is again confirmed, namely, that the velo|city is directly as the &s;quare root of the weight of powder, as far as to about the charge of 8 ounces: and &s;o it would continue for all charges, were the guns of an indefinite length. But as the length of the charge is increa&s;ed, and bears a more con&s;iderable proportion to the length of the bore, the velocity falls the more &s;hort of that proportion.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. That the velocity of the ball increa&s;es with the charge, to a cer|tain point, which is peculiar to each gun, where it is greate&s;t; and that by further increa&s;ing the charge, the velocity gradually dimini&s;hes till the bore is quite full of powder. That this charge for the greate&s;t velocity is greater as the gun is longer, but not greater however in &s;o high a proportion as the length of the gun is; &s;o that the part of the bore filled with powder bears a le&s;s proportion to the whole in the long guns, than it does in the &s;horter ones; the part of the whole which is filled being indeed nearly in the reciprocal &s;ubduplicate ratio of the length of the empty part. And the other circum&s;tances are as in this

<P N="3">3dly. It appears that the velocity continually increa&s;es as the gun is longer, though the increa&s;e in velocity is but very &s;mall in re&s;pect to the increa&s;e in length, the velocities being in a ratio &s;omewhat le&s;s than that of the &s;quare roots of the length of the bore, but &s;omewhat greater than that of the cube roots of the length, and is indeed nearly in the middle ratio between the two. But the particular degrees of velocity for each gun, and charge, may be &s;een at p. 255 and 257.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. It appears, from the table of ranges in art. 121, p. 263, that the range increa&s;es in a much le&s;s ratio than the velocity, and indeed is nearly as the &s;quare root of the velocity, the gun and elevation being the &s;ame. And when this is compared with the property of the velocity and length of gun in the foregoing paragraph, we perceive that we gain extremely little in the range by a great increa&s;e in the length of the gun, the charge being the &s;ame. And indeed the range is nearly as the 5th root of the length of the bore; which is &s;o &s;mall an increa&s;e, as to amount only to about 1/7th part more range for a double length of gun.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. From the &s;ame table in art. 121, it al&s;o appears that the time of &s;light is nearly as the range; the gun and elevation being the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="268" REF="273">6thly. It appears that there is no difference cau&s;ed in the velocity or range, by varying the weight of the gun, nor by the u&s;e of wads, nor by different degrees of ramming, nor by firing the charge of powder in different parts of it.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. But a very great difference in the velocity ari&s;es from a &s;mall degree of windage. Indeed with the u&s;ual e&s;tabli&s;hed windage only, namely, about 1/20th of the caliber, no le&s;s than between &frac13; and &frac14; of the powder e&s;capes and is lo&s;t. And as the balls are often &s;maller than that &s;ize, it frequently happens that &frac12; the powder is lo&s;t by unnece&s;&s;ary windage.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. It appears that the re&s;i&s;ting force of wood, to balls fired into it, is not con&s;tant. And that the depths penetrated by different velo|cities or charges, are nearly as the logarithms of the charges, in&s;tead of being as the charges them&s;elves, or, which is the &s;ame thing, as the &s;quare of the velocity.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. The&s;e, and mo&s;t other experiments, &s;hew that balls are greatly deflected from the direction they are projected in; and that &s;o much as 300 or 400 yards in a range of a mile, or almo&s;t &frac14;th of the range, which is nearly a deflection of an angle of 15 degrees.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. Finally, the&s;e experiments furni&s;h us with the following con|comitant data, to a tolerable degree of accuracy; namely, the dimen&s;ions and elevation of the gun, the weight and dimen&s;ions of the powder and &s;hot, with the range and time of &s;light, and fir&s;t velocity of the ball; from which it is to be hoped that the mea&s;ure of the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to projectiles may be determined, and thereby lay the foundation for a true and practical &s;y&s;tem of gunnery, which may be as well u&s;eful in &s;ervice as in theory; e&s;pecially after a &s;ew more accurate ranges are determined with better balls than &s;ome of the la&s;t employed on the fore|going ranges.</P>
