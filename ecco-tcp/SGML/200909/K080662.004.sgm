<P>The Heron is one of the mo&s;t common birds that inhabit this kingdom: and there is &s;carcely any part of the globe that has been vi&s;ited by travellers, in which it has not been noticed. In Britain it was formerly held in high e&s;timation, not only becau&s;e its fle&s;h was accounted a delicacy at the tables of the nobility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from a curious book, entitled <HI>The Regulations of the Hou&s;hold of the Fifth Earl of</HI> NORTHUMBERLAND, <HI>begun in</HI> 1512, that Herons were valued at the &s;ame price as <HI>Bytters</HI> (Bitterns), <HI>Fe&s;&s;aunts</HI> (Phea&s;ants), <HI>Curlewes</HI> (Curlews), and <HI>Peacockes</HI> (Peacocks).</P>
<P>"At PRINCIPAL FEASTS.&mdash;Item, it is thought in likewyze that HEARONSEWYS be bought for my <HI>Lordees own mees;</HI> &s;o that they be at xiid. a pece." The price of the Crane was 16d. at the &s;ame time, and the Goo&s;e 3d. or at mo&s;t 4d.&mdash;<HI>Partridges</HI> 2d. <HI>Woodcocks</HI> 1 or 1&frac12;.; and <HI>Snipes</HI> three for a penny.</P></NOTE>: but becau&s;e Heron Hawking was a favourite diver&s;ion, in&s;omuch that laws were enacted for the pre&s;ervation of the &s;pecies, and any per&s;on by de&s;troying the eggs incurred a penalty of twenty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>The plumage of the male bird is remarkable for its elegance; per|haps we could with le&s;s propriety u&s;e the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion, if &s;peaking of its general appearance and proportions. Nature has not provided it with webbed feet to &s;wim after its prey, which is almo&s;t wholly of the aquatic kind, but has furni&s;hed it with very long legs to wade after it, and the&s;e give it rather an aukward appearance when &s;tanding on the land. The neck al&s;o is long and &s;lender, but when it &s;tands on the &s;ide of a &s;tream or river waiting for the pa&s;&s;ing of a fi&s;h, its neck and head are drawn between the &s;houlders: in flying its neck is al&s;o crouched down, and the head almo&s;t concealed between the &s;houlders. The male is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female by having a fine cre&s;t of black feathers; two in particular, in &s;ome &s;pecimens, are eight
<PB REF="7">
inches in length. Mr. Latham believes that this appendage is found only in males of a full age, or perhaps very old birds. Mr. Pennant &s;ays that the long &s;oft black feathers on the &s;ides were u&s;ed in old times as egrets for the hair, or ornaments to the caps of knights of the garter; and the cre&s;ts of the males are now u&s;ed as ornaments in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The female has only a very &s;hort plume of du&s;ky greyi&s;h feathers, and the loo&s;e feathers that hang over the brea&s;t are very &s;hort, while tho&s;e of the other &s;ex are long. This has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed a di&s;tinct kind: the accurate Linneus de&s;cribed it as another &s;pecies, under the &s;pecific name <HI>cinerea,</HI> and many other naturali&s;ts have been of the &s;ame opinion, as appears by the &s;ynonyms: Mr. Pennant ob|&s;erves this was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed; "but later ob&s;ervations prove them to be the &s;ame." Mr. Latham adopts preci&s;ely the opinion of Mr. Pennant, but in neither of their accounts can we find the au|thority on which that opinion is founded. It is worthy of remark that Albin, who lived at a time when Heronries were far more nu|merous than at pre&s;ent (though even now they are very common in &s;ome parts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"At <HI>Cre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Hall,</HI> near <HI>Go&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> I have counted eighty ne&s;ts in one tree." <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>), in the fir&s;t volume of his Birds, has figured the male, and in the third volume the female, yet gives not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that he did not con&s;ider them as di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In the breeding &s;ea&s;on they unite in large &s;ocieties, and build on the highe&s;t trees. The ne&s;t is made of &s;ticks, and lined with ru&s;hes, wool, feathers, &amp;c. They lay four, five, or &s;ix eggs, of a pale green colour. They de&s;ert the ne&s;ts in the winter, and are then found on the banks of rivers, or mar&s;hy places.</P>
<P>The length is about three feet: breadth five feet; weight exceeds three pounds.</P>

<P>The length of this &s;pecies is commonly about ten inches: breadth twenty-four: weight two ounces and a half. The male is known by a white &s;pot under the chin. Mr. Latham mentions a variety, (Var A) in which the lower part of the brea&s;t, belly, thighs, under wing coverts and vent are white; and in &s;ome &s;pecimens of the common kind the white at the vent is &s;pread towards the thighs. The webs of the feet are depre&s;&s;ed, and form a cre&s;cent: the colour of the legs &s;eem to vary; our bird had &s;carcely any of the red tinge in the black colour.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds frequent our &s;hores in &s;ummer. Latham &s;ays they are ob&s;erved on the coa&s;ts of Kent in a few days after the other terns; and, as they differ &s;omewhat in their manners, do not a&s;&s;ociate. They are found during &s;pring and &s;ummer in va&s;t numbers in the fens of Lincoln&s;hire. The eggs are three or four in number, of a greeni&s;h or olive colour, &s;potted with black, and have al&s;o a band of the &s;ame colour about the middle. The&s;e eggs are depo&s;ited among the reeds in fens and other mar&s;hy places. The food is in|&s;ects and &s;mall fi&s;h, which it procures by hovering over the water, and darting on its prey in the &s;ame manner as mo&s;t other birds of the &s;ame genus.</P>

<P>It &s;eems undetermined whether we ought to con&s;ider this as a di&s;|tinct &s;pecies, or only as a variety of the Sky Lark. Mr. Latham, in his Synop&s;is, con&s;iders it a variety, and ob&s;erves that he is aware of this and other Birds becoming black by feeding on <HI>Hemp-&s;eed,</HI> as was the ca&s;e with a Goldfinch and Hou&s;e Sparrow. It appears al&s;o liable to much variation of colours in different &s;pecimens. One in

the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum is of a full deep black throughout, and that from which the figure in our plate is copied, is of a lighter colour in many parts than that &s;eems to have been from which Albin engraved his plate. The account which this Author has given is curious: "This Lark," &s;ays he, "was taken with a clap net by one of the Bird-catchers in a field near <HI>Highgate,</HI> and brought to me by <HI>Mr. Davenport,</HI> which I have taken care to draw exactly from the Bird, neither adding nor dimini&s;hing in the draught or colouring. This being a curio&s;ity, I was de&s;ired by one of my &s;ub&s;cribers to make a plate of it."</P>
<P>The name Albin has given it is &s;carcely ju&s;tified by this de&s;crip|tion which he has added. "The bill of this Bird was of a du&s;ky yellow; the irides of the eyes yellowi&s;h: it was all over of a dark reddi&s;h brown, inclining to black, excepting the hind part of the head, on which was &s;ome du&s;ky yellowi&s;h feathers; likewi&s;e &s;ome feathers with whiti&s;h edges on the belly."</P>
<P>Our &s;pecimen was &s;hot in Scotland by Mr. Agneau, Gardener to the late Duche&s;s of Portland, &s;everal years ago. Its length rather exceeds &s;even inches.</P>

Platt</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> I recollect his having men|tioned, that once meeting with a lump of this <HI>&s;tar-jelly,</HI> on examina|tion he found the toes of a <HI>Frog</HI> or <HI>Toad</HI> &s;till adhering, and undi&s;|&s;olved; and from thence concluded it to be the remains of one of the&s;e, having been &s;wallowed whole by &s;ome bird, and the indige&s;ti|ble parts brought up in the condition he found it."</P>

<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome authors that the Parus Ater, and Parus Palu&s;tris <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;h Titmou&s;e.</NOTE> of Linnaeus were not di&s;tinct &s;pecies, but merely the two &s;exes of one kind; and others have thought the latter only a variety of the fir&s;t. Willughby is the fir&s;t author worthy of con|&s;ideration who has noticed the preci&s;e difference between the two birds. He &s;ays the Mar&s;h Titmou&s;e differs from the Colemou&s;e in the&s;e particulars: 1&s;t, that it is bigger: 2d, that it wants the white &s;pot on the head: 3d, it has a larger tail: 4th, its under &s;ide is white: 5th, it has le&s;s black under the chin: 6th, it wants the white &s;pot on the covert of the wings. Mr. Pennant ob&s;erves on this account given by Willughby, that the la&s;t di&s;tinction does not hold in ge|neral, as the &s;ubject figured in the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> had tho&s;e &s;pots; yet wanted that on the hind part of the head.</P>
<P><PB REF="27">The opinion of Mr. Latham in this particular de&s;erves attention al&s;o; he &s;ays, "it is much to be feared that the Mar&s;h Titmou&s;e is not a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; mo&s;t probably a mere variety of the Cole|mou&s;e." <HI>Gen. Syn. vol.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Supplement</HI> to the <HI>General Synop&s;is of Birds,</HI> Mr. Latham has added the following account under the head MARSH TITMOUSE. "In my <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> it has not appeared clear to me, whether the <HI>Cole|mou&s;e</HI> and this were different &s;pecies. I find it to be the opinion of <HI>Sepp,</HI> that they form but one, being both figured in the &s;ame plates as <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female.</HI> In one of them is a &s;pot of white on the hind head, and the &s;ides of the head are white: the throat black. The other has the top of the head wholly black, and the black &s;pot of the throat wanting. The ne&s;t &s;eems here compo&s;ed of &s;edge, mixed with large <HI>cat's-tail,</HI> lined with down and feathers: furni&s;hed with five white eggs, mottled with red brown.</P>
<P>The Colemou&s;e appears to be le&s;s injurious in gardens and orchards than others of the &s;ame genus: it is al&s;o le&s;s numerous, and generally inhabits woods. The length is four inches. It is found throughout <HI>Europe</HI> and in <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>The Nutcracker is &s;o extremely rare in this Country, that Mr. Pennant has added it to his Briti&s;h Zoology, in the third plate of the Appendix of Vol. II. And as we are indebted to his authority for a&s;certaining its being an Engli&s;h &s;pecies, we have tran&s;cribed his account of it.</P>
<P>"The &s;pecimen we took our de&s;cription from, is the only one we ever heard was &s;hot in the&s;e kingdoms: it was killed near <HI>Mo&s;tyn, Flint&s;hire, October</HI> 5, 1753."</P>
<P>"It was &s;omewhat le&s;s than the Jackdaw: the bill &s;trait, &s;trong, black: the colour of the whole head and neck, brea&s;t and body, was a ru&s;ty brown: the other parts marked with triangular white &s;pots: the wings black: the coverts &s;potted in the &s;ame manner as the body: the tail rounded at the end, black, tipt with white: the vent-feathers white: the legs du&s;ky."</P>
<P>Mr. Latham mentions a &s;econd in&s;tance: he &s;aw the mutilated &s;kin of one that was &s;hot in Kent.</P>
<P><PB REF="31">It appears from different authors, that this bird is mo&s;t frequent in the pine fore&s;ts in Ru&s;&s;ia, Siberia, and Kamt&s;chatka: it is al&s;o found in Germany, where it is more common than in any other part of Europe, though it inhabits the mountainous parts of Sweden and Denmark: it &s;ometimes vi&s;its France in flocks. Found al&s;o in North America.</P>
<P>In its manners it is &s;aid to greatly re&s;emble the Jay. It feeds on the kernels of the pine, wild berries, and in&s;ects; and makes its ne&s;t in the holes of trees.</P>

<P>The Nuthatch is a &s;mall bird: it weighs about one ounce, and is five inches and three quarters in length. The female differs from the male only in &s;ize; the weight &s;eldom exceeding five or &s;ix drams.</P>
<P>It breeds in the hollows of trees, and lays &s;ix or &s;even eggs, of a dirty white colour, dotted with rufous; the&s;e are depo&s;ited on the rotten wood, mixed with a little mo&s;s. If the entrance to the ne&s;t is too large, it clo&s;es up part of it with clay, leaving only a very &s;mall hole to creep through. The ne&s;t of this bird is &s;eldom di&s;|turbed, or the eggs taken away, when the female, is &s;itting, for her hi&s;&s;ing &s;o nearly re&s;embles that of a &s;nake, that few would venture to put their hands into the hole to &s;earch for them; and it is &s;aid, that the female will &s;uffer her feathers to be plucked off rather than
<PB REF="35">
de&s;ert her eggs or young. The male al&s;o &s;hews the greate&s;t tender|ne&s;s for them and its mate, during the time of incubation.</P>
<P>It feeds on all kinds of in&s;ects, as well as nuts: of the latter, it lays up a con&s;iderable hoard in the hollows of trees, and brings them out when other food is &s;carce. The manner of its cracking the nut is curious, and has been noticed by &s;everal authors, and par|ticularly <HI>Willoughby:</HI> he &s;ays, "It is a pretty &s;ight to &s;ee her fetch a nut out of her hoard, when, placing it fa&s;t in a chink, &s;he &s;tands above it, with the head downwards, and, &s;triking it with all her force, breaks the &s;hell, and catches up the kernel."</P>
<P>In its manners, it is not unlike the Woodpecker tribe. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;leep perched; for, when confined in a cage, it would creep into a corner at night to &s;leep. Dr. Plott &s;ays, "this bird, by putting its bill into a crack in the bough of a tree, can make &s;uch a violent &s;ound as if it was rending a&s;under, &s;o that the noi&s;e may be heard at lea&s;t twelve &s;core yards."</P>
<P>It is not migratory, but changes its &s;ituation in winter. Pennant ob&s;erves, that it makes a chattering noi&s;e in Autumn. Latham &s;ays, he has been informed, that it has, at times, a whi&s;tle like that of a man.</P>

<P>This pretty &s;pecies is very common in the &s;ummer.

The ne&s;t is u&s;ually made in the hollows of broken walls, or old trees: it is compo&s;ed of mo&s;s, with a lining of hair and feathers; and con|tains four, &s;ometimes five eggs, of a light blue colour; and in other re&s;pects re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Hedge Sparrow, except that they are rather more elongated at the &s;malle&s;t end.

<P>The Red&s;tart is rather &s;maller than the Redbrea&s;t; mea&s;uring about five inches. The male is known by the chin, cheeks, and throat being black: in the female the chin is white; and the red colour of the brea&s;t is paler than in the male. It has one very peculiar habit,
<PB REF="39">
when it &s;hakes its tail it does not move it up and down like the Wag-tail, but horizontally, or &s;ideways, like a Dog when he is fawning. Its note is &s;oft and plea&s;ing; but it will not bear confinement in a cage, unle&s;s when reared from ne&s;tlings, when it requires the &s;ame treatment as the Nightingale.

<P>The Wryneck is the only &s;pecies of the genus <HI>(Yunx)</HI> yet de&s;cribed by any author; and &s;eems to have given Linnaeus &s;ome trouble to determine to what genus he &s;hould a&s;&s;ign it; for though it has the tongue of the Woodpecker, as well as the &s;ituation of the toes, the bill is too weak for that genus. Linnaeus, in the former edition of the <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> placed it with the Cuckow; but it appears to be the opinion of later naturali&s;ts that it &s;hould form a di&s;tinct genus, his new genus having been generally adopted. The <HI>Jyngi Congener</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Torcol ray&eacute; of <HI>Bri&s;&s;on.</HI></NOTE> of Aldravendus is certainly no other than a variety.</P>
<P>The colours are altogether very plain, but are &s;o beautifully varied and pencilled, that, as Mr. Pennant ob&s;erves, Nature has made ample amends for their want of &s;plendor. The colours are paler in the female than the male.</P>
<P><PB REF="43">This bird builds in hollow trees: <HI>Latham</HI> &s;ays they make no ne&s;t, but lay the eggs on the bare rotten wood. <HI>Pennant</HI> &s;ays it makes the ne&s;t of dry gra&s;s. The eggs, according to <HI>Buffon,</HI> are as white as ivory; and <HI>Pennant</HI> adds, that they are &s;o thin that the yolk may be &s;een through them. The number of eggs &s;eldom exceed nine.</P>
<P>The Wryneck is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Bird of pa&s;&s;age, appearing in the &s;pring eight or ten days earlier than the Cuckow. It feeds on In&s;ects, and &s;eems particularly fond of Ants; the&s;e the extreme length of the tongue enables it to pick out of the cracks where they are concealed. It takes its name from a habit it has of turning its head back to the &s;houlders when alarmed or terrified: it can al&s;o erect the feathers of the head like tho&s;e of a Jay.&mdash;Weight of this Bird is one ounce and a quarter: length &s;even inches: breadth eleven.</P>
<P>This Bird is found throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> and in many other parts of the world.</P>

<P>We have only three &s;pecies of Butcher-birds, or Shrikes, in this country: the Great, Red-backed, and Wood Chat. The fir&s;t is very &s;carce: the &s;econd is not common; and the la&s;t is extremely rare: &s;o that we have little opportunity to notice the &s;ingular manners of this tribe. Nature &s;eems to have allotted more than an ordinary &s;hare of courage to the&s;e little creatures: they equal the eagle in the fiercene&s;s of their attacks on &s;maller birds, and defend them&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e they cannot overcome with the greate&s;t vigour and re&s;olution. Though in this re&s;pect they imitate the larger carnivorous birds, they have not, like them, claws &s;trong enough to tear their prey to pieces, but, to &s;upply this defect, they fa&s;ten it on a thorn and pull it a&s;under with their bill. Even when confined in a cage, it is &s;aid that they treat their food in a &s;imilar manner, &s;ticking it again&s;t the wires be|fore they eat it.</P>
<P>We now &s;peak of the manners generally peculiar to the tribe: how far tho&s;e of the Wood Chat accord with them, we can only pre&s;ume from being of the &s;ame genus; no Engli&s;h naturali&s;t having yet been &s;o fortunate as to meet with it &s;ince <HI>Willoughby</HI> and <HI>Ray.</HI>
<PB REF="47">
Pennant has not given a figure of it in the Briti&s;h Zoology; and it is a fact well known, that both Lewin and Walcot have given figures of it drawn from mere de&s;criptions: this is the more to be regretted as no &s;pecimen of it was either in the Leverian or Briti&s;h Mu&s;eums: and that eminent ornithologi&s;t, Mr. Latham, with his accu&s;tomed candour acknowledges, in his account of it, that he has never &s;een it. "Mr. <HI>Pennant,</HI>" &s;ays he, "does not de&s;cribe this bird from his <HI>own</HI> in&s;pection; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it has never come under <HI>mine.</HI>"&mdash; He al&s;o, &s;ays <HI>Buffon,</HI> does not &s;peak of it as uncommon, but gives it, as his opinion, that the red-backed Shrike is a variety of this &s;pecies, as well as &s;ome other kinds he mentions; and adds, that from his own ob&s;ervation he cannot deny the fact. We have com|pared them, and do not he&s;itate to give them as two di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It is only the male bird that we have in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t own our&s;elves indebted for the following de&s;cription of the female to Pennant and Latham; nor are we certain that our &s;pecimen was &s;hot in England, but rather &s;u&s;pect that it came from Germany.&mdash;The length is &s;even inches and three quarters. The female differs from the male: the upper part of the head, neck and body are reddi&s;h, &s;triated tran&s;ver&s;ely with brown: the lower parts of the body are of a dirty white, rayed with brown, marked near the end with du&s;ky, and tipped with red.</P>

<P>The Great Cinereous Shrike is uncommon in England. It is of the migratory kind, coming in May and departing in September. We learn from Buffon that it is not &s;carce in France.

Mr. Latham &s;ays, the la&s;t bird
<PB REF="65">
of this kind found in Scotland was in <HI>Chicholm</HI>'s great fore&s;t, in Strathgla&s;s.</P>
<P>Albin gave a figure of it in his Ornithology, publi&s;hed &s;ixty years &s;ince, and then he &s;eems not to have known that it was a Briti&s;h &s;pecies; he calls it the Mountain Cock from Mu&s;covy. From this we may infer that the breed was nearly extirpated half a century ago.</P>
<P>According to mo&s;t authors it thrives be&s;t in cold countries. It is found in Italy, but only in the higher regions, where the air is bleak. In Ru&s;&s;ia it is not uncommon, particularly in the A&s;iatic part of that empire. There is a variety of this &s;pecies much &s;maller than the common &s;ort, which is probably owing to the &s;evere cold of the climate in which it lives, being found in Lapland and Norway, the farthe&s;t extreme of Europe towards the Icy Sea.</P>
<P>The male of this &s;pecies is two feet nine inches in length, breadth four feet, and is as large as a Turkey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Scotland it is known by the name of <HI>Capercalze, Aver-calze,</HI> and in the old law books Caperkally: the la&s;t &s;ignifying the <HI>hor&s;e of the woods.</HI> In Germany it is called Aur-han, or Urus, <HI>Wild Ox Cock.</HI>&mdash;Pennant.</NOTE>. The female is &s;maller, twenty &s;ix inches in length. The bill is du&s;ky, throat red, neck and back marked with tran&s;ver&s;e bars of red and black: a few white &s;pots on the brea&s;t, the lower part of an orange colour, belly barred with pale orange and black, the tips of the feathers white; the fea|thers of the back and &s;capulars black, the edges mottled with black and pale reddi&s;h brown: the &s;capulars tipped with white, the inner webs of the quills du&s;ky; the exterior mottled with pale brown: the tail of a deep ru&s;t colour, barred with black and tipped with white.</P>
<P><PB REF="66">The&s;e birds feed on many kinds of plants, and particularly on the tender &s;hoots and &s;eeds of the Pine and Fir trees, which are in the greate&s;t plenty in the fore&s;ts they frequent. The males never a&s;&s;ociate with the females, except from the beginning of February till the end of March: when the male perches on a tree, with his tail &s;pread, the quills lowered to the feet, the neck protruded, and the feathers of the head ruffled. In this po&s;ture it makes a loud and &s;hrill noi&s;e, like the whetting of a &s;cythe, and this it repeats till the females di&s;|cover its haunts. They lay from eight to &s;ixteen eggs, of a white colour, &s;potted with yellow, and larger than tho&s;e of the common hen: the&s;e are depo&s;ited upon mo&s;s, on the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Latham &s;ays of the la&s;t bird of this kind &s;hot in Scotland, "I am well in|formed that the ne&s;t was placed on a Scotch Pine."</NOTE>.

<P>The Little Owl appears to be no where a common bird; in this country it is &s;carce, and in France, Buffon informs us, it is al&s;o rare. It is very &s;eldom found in the woods, which others of the &s;ame tribe inhabit, but frequents ruined edifices, caverns in rocks, and other &s;uch gloomy and &s;olitary places. It lays five eggs, &s;potted with white and a yellowi&s;h colour. In England it has been chiefly found in York&s;hire and Flint&s;hire.</P>
<P>This bird &s;eems liable to much variation in colour. Buffon men|tions one from St. Domingo which had le&s;s white on the throat, and
<PB REF="70">
brown bands on the brea&s;t in&s;tead of longitudinal &s;pots; and another variety from Germany, with the plumage darker than u&s;ual and black irides. <HI>Fri&s;ch</HI> has a figure of this bird with irides of a dark blue colour. The length of this &s;pecies is eight inches. Albin's figure is quoted in the Synonyms, but it is much more &s;lender in its form than our &s;pecimen.</P>

<P>The Hobby is found in the temperate parts of Europe. It was antiently u&s;ed in falconry in this country, particularly in daring of Larks and other &s;mall birds. It is &s;aid, that the Larks never venture to take their flight in &s;ight of this bird; but that if it hovers over them, they will remain motionle&s;s on the ground while the fowler draws a net over them.</P>
<P>We find on comparing the different de&s;criptions given by authors of this bird, with &s;pecimens that have fallen under our ob&s;ervation, that few birds vary more, in the colours of their plumage, than the Hobby: in &s;ome the back is reddi&s;h, or deep brown; in others almo&s;t black with a blui&s;h ca&s;t. Again, we find &s;ome with the back throughout of a very deep lead colour; and others with the edges of the feathers of a pale yellow-brown. The brea&s;t is generally of a pure white with dark &s;pots; but the&s;e al&s;o vary: the white is tinged with a faint dirty-brown in &s;ome; and the &s;pots incline to brown, in&s;tead of black, in others. The irides are brown of every &s;hade in different birds:
<PB REF="74">
one author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Bri&s;&s;on.</NOTE> &s;ays they are yellow. Some of the&s;e variations, we mu&s;t pre&s;ume, depend on the age of the bird; but one circum&s;tance has been noticed in adult &s;pecimens that de&s;erves particular notice, the vent and thighs, which are generally ferruginous or rufous, are &s;ometimes white. Mr. Latham, &s;peaking of this variation, &s;ays he has a &s;pecimen, in which the thighs are du&s;ky white, longitudinally marked with brown; and the vent of a plain white: one of our &s;pecimens al&s;o preci&s;ely agrees with this account.</P>

<P>The Stone-Chat is a con&s;tant inhabitant of this country. In Sum|mer it frequents heaths and commons: in Winter it retires to the mar&s;hes, being the only places in which its favourite food, In&s;ects, is found in abundance.</P>
<P>The length of this bird is four inches and three quarters. The head of the female is ferruginous colour &s;potted with black; that of the male is entirely black: they differ very little in other re&s;pects, except that the colours of the former are more ob&s;cure than in the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t authors agree that this is a noi&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s creature, ince&s;|&s;antly flying from bu&s;h to bu&s;h, and always carefully concealing the place where its ne&s;t is depo&s;ited; never alighting on the &s;ame &s;pot, but creeping to it on the ground in an artful manner. The ne&s;t is placed at the bottom of &s;ome bu&s;h, or under a &s;tone, and u&s;ually con|tains five or &s;ix eggs, of a pale greeni&s;h colour with marks of rufous.</P>

<P>Mr. Latham has given this &s;pecies a place in his li&s;t of the Birds of Great Britain; and we cannot &s;urely incur di&s;approbation by follow|ing his example. If the authority of Mr. Latham is un&s;upported by the opinion of Mr. Pennant, we mu&s;t recollect that the Zoology of the latter author appeared many years before the <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> of Mr. Latham; and probably the &s;pecies was not &s;o generally diffu&s;ed and dome&s;ticated in this country before the Briti&s;h Zoology was publi&s;hed, as &s;ince that period.

<P>This &s;pecies is a native of Africa, particularly of the Cape of Good Hope: from the latter place va&s;t numbers have been brought to this country; and the climate favouring their increa&s;e, the kind is not uncommon in many parts of the kingdom. It is rather an or|namental than u&s;eful &s;pecies, and is generally kept in Gentlemen's ponds for plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Albin publi&s;hed a figure and de&s;cription of this Bird from a &s;peci|men reared in this country &s;ixty years ago: he &s;ays it fed on gra&s;s and corn like other Gee&s;e, and thus concludes his ob&s;ervations on the two &s;exes, "The difference between the cock and hen could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed neither by the colours or &s;hape, but only by the cock's running to the hen with open wings, cla&s;ping or embracing her round with them.

<P>Mr. Pennant, and other writers on the Zoology of this country, &s;uppo&s;ed the Merlin never bred here, till Dr. Hey&s;ham met with two ne&s;ts in <HI>Cumberland:</HI> they were placed on the ground like that of the Ringtail; and in each were four young. The egg, formerly in the Portland Mu&s;eum, was of an uniform purpli&s;h brown colour, round|i&s;h, and one inch and a quarter in length. The Merlin appears in England when the Hobby di&s;appears, which happens in October.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies, like the Hobby, &s;eems to vary exceedingly in colour in different &s;pecimens; in &s;ome the back and wings are blui&s;h a&s;h-colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;pecimen in the Leverian Mu&s;eum an&s;wers to this de&s;cription.</NOTE>, in others ferruginous: the bars of clay-colour and du&s;ky on the tail, are from thirteen to fifteen in mo&s;t birds; but Mr. Pennant &s;ays, one he examined had only eight; our &s;pecimen has twelve bars acro&s;s.</P>
<P>The length of the Merlin is twelve inches: though &s;mall, it was formerly trained for hawking, particularly for taking partridges, which &s;ome authors &s;ay, it could kill by a &s;ingle &s;troke on the neck. The Merlin flies low, frequents the &s;ides of roads, and &s;kims from one part to another in &s;earch of prey. It is de&s;cribed as a bird wanting neither cunning nor &s;pirit. It is at this time very &s;carce in England, and &s;eems to be uncommon in every part of Europe.</P>

<P>The beautiful combination of vivid glo&s;&s;es with which the plumage of this common bird is enriched, has been &s;o little attended to in paintings of it, that we are afraid we &s;hall be accu&s;ed of flattering its appearance, by a gaudy introduction of unnatural tints in the annexed figure: to avoid &s;uch imputation we have &s;trictly ob&s;erved, and ac|curately expre&s;&s;ed the colours from a &s;pecimen, in our collection, that had been taken in a &s;tate of nature. We are aware that the colours will vary in different &s;pecimens of every &s;pecies, but by cor|rectly repre&s;enting one that is perfect, it will convey a better idea of the bird than any of the mutilated creatures kept in cages for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The tail of the Magpie is particularly remarkable: its colours are more &s;plendid than any other part of the bird: its form is like a wedge; the two middle feathers eleven inches long, the re&s;t decrea&s;e gradually, the outermo&s;t being only five inches and an half. The principal colour produced by reflection on the black part of the body is fine blue, or purple; the fir&s;t tint is very vivid on the wings. The
<PB REF="88">
fine&s;t green is the predominant colour of the tail, which changes in the folds to reddi&s;h yellow, with a gilded hue, fine brown, blue, purple, and &s;hades of glo&s;&s;y black throughout. The&s;e colours cannot be &s;een at a di&s;tance, becau&s;e they are produced only by the light falling in a particular direction, and all the bright glo&s;&s;es a&s;&s;imilate with the blacker hues when the bird is removed far from the eye of the &s;pectator.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to enlarge on the pecular habits of a bird, that is familiar to every ru&s;tic inhabitant in the kingdom. In all its actions it di&s;covers a degree of in&s;tinct &s;uperior to mo&s;t birds. In many re&s;pects it re&s;embles the crow; like that creature, it feeds in|di&s;criminately on every kind of food, In&s;ects, grain, &s;mall birds, or their eggs, carrion, and even young poultry. Sometimes it procures its food by &s;tratagem, at others by annoying larger animals when it has no danger to apprehend from them. It is often &s;een perched on the back of a Sheep or a Cow, picking off the In&s;ects that infe&s;t them. In this re&s;pect we allow them to be u&s;eful; but if they re|lieve the poor animals from their &s;maller enemies, they &s;ubject them to their own uncontroulable in&s;olence, and &s;ometimes pick out the eyes of animals that attempt to re&s;i&s;t them. In a dome&s;tic &s;tate it is often taught to repeat words, or &s;entences. It does not imitate the human voice with the &s;ame facility and propriety as the parrot, but &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Its great &s;hare of in&s;tinct is clearly demon&s;trated by the &s;ituation and manner in which the ne&s;t is built: it is placed con&s;picuou&s;ly on the top of &s;ome tree, or in a hawthorn bu&s;h, but is always fenced below by brambles and other thick bu&s;hes, that make it difficult of acce&s;s. The ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of thorny twigs well interwoven, and has the
<PB REF="89">
thorns &s;ticking outwards: it is lined with wool, feathers and roots, and is plai&s;tered within with fine mud. It is defended above by a thorny covering, and has an entrance ju&s;t large enough to admit the bird. The Magpie lays &s;ix or &s;even eggs of a greeni&s;h colour, &s;potted with black.</P>

<P>Five &s;pecies of this tribe of birds are natives of this country, if we include the Brown Tern mentioned by Mr. Latham as a doubtful kind, and not noticed by Mr. Pennant.

<P>The haunts and manners of this bird are nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the Common Tern; it feeds on &s;mall Fi&s;h and In&s;ects, lives on the &s;ides of rivers, or on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and breeds among&s;t the ru&s;hes.

<P>The Black Cock, like the Cock of the Wood, is &s;eldom found, except in northern countries; in tho&s;e near the &s;outh, which it &s;ometimes inhabits, it prefers the colde&s;t &s;ituations among&s;t woods and mountains: it feeds on the birch trees and mountain fruits. In Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, they are very abundant, as they were formerly in Scotland, Wales, and the north of England; at pre&s;ent they are much dimini&s;hed in this country, and, perhaps, may become as &s;carce as the Cock of the Wood is at pre&s;ent, the fle&s;h being much e&s;teemed, and therefore eagerly &s;ought for.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to partake greatly of the habits of the Cock of the Wood; it frequents the &s;ame &s;ituations, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the &s;ame kind of food.

<P><PB REF="97">The female is much &s;maller than the male. Its length is eighteen inches, weight two pounds; the colours are red, black, and du&s;ky white, which are di&s;po&s;ed in alternate bars and &s;pots, in different directions. The mo&s;t remarkable part of the male bird is the tail, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen feathers; the exterior ones curve very much outwards, and give it a forked appearance; but when the tail is expanded, it re&s;embles a large fan. Length of the male is twenty-one inches.</P>
<P>The female lay &s;ix or eight eggs, of a yellowi&s;h colour, &s;peckled with ferruginous, and blotched at the &s;mall end with the &s;ame colour. The young males leave the female parent in the beginning of winter, and keep in flocks, of &s;ix or eight, till &s;pring. They are very quarrel&s;ome, and fight like game-cocks.</P>

<P>Among&s;t the number of curious and elegant &s;pecies that have been extirpated in this country, the Engli&s;h Naturali&s;t will mo&s;t regret the lo&s;s of this bird. It was formerly very common, and its fle&s;h much admired. It formed a part of many of the old Engli&s;h fea&s;ts; and, among&s;t others, that recorded by Leland, which was given by George Nevell, archbi&s;hop of York, in the reign of Edward the Fourth, alone included <HI>"one thou&s;and Egrittes."</HI> At this time it is con&s;i|dered &s;uch a rarity, that Mr. Pennant ob&s;erves, in his Appendix to the Briti&s;h Zoology, "We once received out of <HI>Angle&s;ea</HI> the feathers of a bird &s;hot there, which we &s;u&s;pect to be the Egret; this is the only in&s;tance, perhaps, of its being found in our country." The &s;ame author adds, in another part, "We have never met with this bird, or the Crane, in England, but formed our de&s;criptions from &s;pecimens in the elegant cabinet of Dr. Mauduit, in Paris."</P>
<P>In &s;ome foreign countries it is &s;till very common: is found in &s;everal parts of Europe and A&s;ia: it is al&s;o &s;aid to be found in Africa, and on the American continent.</P>
<P>The weight of this bird is one pound, the length about eleven inches; the appendage of loo&s;e feathers, which is &s;ituated on the back, and hang over the rump, were anciently u&s;ed to decorate caps, or head pieces; and hence the ornament to a cap, in later times, was called an aigrette.</P>

<P>The Imber Diver inhabits the &s;eas about the Orkney and Ferroe I&s;lands, and never vi&s;its the &s;outhern parts of Great Britain, except in &s;evere winters. Living chiefly at &s;ea, it is taken with much dif|ficulty. If pur&s;ued when &s;wimming, it dives under the water, and does not appear again till it is at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from its pur&s;uers. It is often caught under water by a hook, baited with &s;mall fi&s;h. Willoughby &s;ays, they are &s;ometimes taken in this manner &s;ixty feet under water.</P>
<P>Being rarely &s;een on land, it has been believed that it never quitted the water, and that it hatched its young in a hole formed by nature under the wing. Naturali&s;ts have di&s;covered its ne&s;t among <HI>reeds</HI> and <HI>flags</HI> in the water, where it is kept continually wet, as in &s;ome of the Grebe genus.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies is larger than the common goo&s;e: the length is about twenty-five inches. The male is &s;aid to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a few brown &s;pecks on the &s;ide of the neck, and by having the colours throughout more defined than in the female: &s;ome authors have, however, con&s;idered the &s;uppo&s;ed females as birds not in an adult &s;tate.</P>

<P>The Kingsfi&s;her is &s;even inches in length; its weight is one ounce and a quarter. It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to remark, that this bird is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beautiful of the feathered race that inhabits the &s;outh of Europe. In its form it is rather inelegant; but its colours are fine throughout: the azure of its back is exceedingly bright; and when the creature is hovering in the air, in a fine day, it appears re&s;plendent in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd fictions that poets, in the vigour of their imagi|nation, have formed concerning this bird, have particularly in|clined naturali&s;ts to examine its manners of life with attention. The poets placed it in a floating ne&s;t, during the time of incubation, and endowed it with power to calm the adver&s;e winds and &s;eas. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> tell us, that this bird is mo&s;t common in the &s;eas of Sicily: that it &s;at only a few days, and tho&s;e in the depth of

winter, and during that period the mariner might fail in full &s;ecu|rity, for which rea&s;on they were &s;tyled <HI>Halcyon days</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE>. Among the moderns, its fle&s;h has been thought unperi&s;hable, and capable of pre&s;erving woollen and other ve&s;tments from decay; and it has al&s;o been &s;uppo&s;ed to turn its brea&s;t to the north when hung up dead.</P>
<P>Specimens of this bird are brought from almo&s;t every part of the world: in England it is not uncommon: it frequents the &s;ides of running &s;treams, and takes its prey, which con&s;i&s;ts entirely of fi&s;h, by darting on it in the water. It makes no ne&s;t, but lays &s;even or more, beautiful tran&s;parent white eggs, in a large hole in the bank of a river or &s;tream.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>IMPELLED by grateful &s;entiments, the Author cannot conclude the Fourth Volume of this Work without expre&s;&s;ing his &s;incere acknowledgments to the Public for the favourable manner in which it has been received. From the encourage|ment which has attended it in the cour&s;e of publication, he pre&s;umes that the expectations of the Sub&s;cribers have not been di&s;appointed in any part of it; and it is particularly plea&s;ing to find, the concluding numbers have given the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Author would have been happy if he could have promi&s;ed, at the commencement of this Work, to pre&s;ent a complete Hi&s;tory of Briti&s;h Ornithology; but, being aware of the difficulty of procuring &s;ome of the rare <HI>Aborigines</HI> of the Country, and fearful of di&s;plea&s;ing many Sub&s;cribers, by introducing others that are familiar to every one, he con|ceived it would be mo&s;t advi&s;able to &s;elect only tho&s;e which were particularly intere&s;ting to the Engli&s;h Naturali&s;t, or Country Gentleman; the&s;e, including all the Birds formerly known in Great Britain, together with tho&s;e rare migratory Species that are &s;ometimes found even in the interior of the Country.</P>
<P>As far as the pre&s;cribed limits of the Work would admit, the Author hopes he has fulfilled this promi&s;e to the Public. If he has excluded &s;ome fine Birds, &s;uch as the Goldfinch, the Bullfinch, the Phea&s;ant and its varieties, with others no le&s;s beautiful, it was to re&s;erve a place for &s;ome that were &s;carcely known to exi&s;t in the Country. The <HI>Ro&s;e-coloured Ouzel,
<PB REF="116">
Roller, Little Bittern,</HI> and <HI>Golden Oriole,</HI> are of this de&s;crip|tion; and to the&s;e we may add the <HI>Egret, Cock of the Wood, Black Cock, Black Woodpecker,</HI> and <HI>Waxen Chatterer.</HI> The <HI>Wood Chat,</HI> which Engli&s;h authors have figured from mere de&s;criptions, &s;ufficiently mark the attention of the Author to render this Work no le&s;s re&s;pectable than u&s;eful. The <HI>Red-necked Grebe, Northern Diver, Water Ouzel, Dartford War|bler, Du&s;ky Lark, Long-legged Plover,</HI> with many others, equally rare and intere&s;ting, having been procured purpo&s;ely for this Work, evidently prove, that no expence has been &s;pared to make it complete.</P>
<P>Since the one hundred Plates have been engraved, &s;ome rare Birds have come into the Author's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but rather than incur the imputation of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the public favour, he declined adding them to the Work, until it appeared to be the wi&s;hes of the Sub&s;cribers to have a Sup|plement: that being to be added, at their reque&s;t, the Public may be per&s;uaded that every exertion will be made to render it worthy of their approbation.</P>
<P>The di&s;tingui&s;hed manner in which Works of Natural Hi&s;tory are encouraged at this period, leads us to a few re|flections, which, it is pre&s;umed, are not entirely inapplicable to the pre&s;ent Work, and may be &s;ome apology for the different publications of that de&s;cription, which the Author has lately &s;ubmitted to the Public.</P>
<P>It is a noble &s;entiment of the Briti&s;h Nation, to be no le&s;s re&s;pected for their learning than admired for their valour, by other nations; yet it is a truth which national pride dare not conceal, that &s;everal &s;ciences, and tho&s;e e&s;pecially of Natural Hi&s;tory, have been more &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated
<PB REF="117">
by our continental neighbours than by our&s;elves. The &s;tudy of tho&s;e &s;ciences unfold too many advantages to civilized &s;ociety to be entirely overlooked in any country; and &s;ome of its branches have ever found admirers in courts, and patrons in princes; but it is not in every country that a number of le&s;s exalted individuals are di&s;po&s;ed to afford them that encouragement, which alone can evince the general ta&s;te of a nation.</P>
<P>The deva&s;tations of war have, indeed, materially checked many learned enquiries in other countries, whil&s;t the Engli&s;h nation, by its fo&s;tering protection, have contributed much to their improvement. This may ultimately excite a laudable emulation in this country, to equal, or excel others, in the knowledge of tho&s;e &s;ciences; for, &s;urely, it is not to our credit, that learned foreigners are well acquainted with the natural productions even of our country, while we remain ignorant of them.</P>
<P>The Author of this Work had formerly conceived, that an Epitome at lea&s;t of the Natural Hi&s;tory of Great Britain, would be acceptable to many; and this is now in forwardne&s;s to completion. Botany, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and plea&s;ing branch, has been, in part, illu&s;trated already, in a manner that re|flects honour on its Authors. The mineral, fo&s;&s;il, and ma|rine productions, are, probably, le&s;s generally known. The In&s;ects and Birds, the Author has endeavoured to illu&s;trate, and he hopes his exertions have not been un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The inimitable beauty and variety, both of &s;tructure and colours, which di&s;tingui&s;h the natural productions of warmer regions, will always obtrude on the attention of European Naturali&s;ts, and agreeably diver&s;ify a &s;tudy, that without
<PB REF="118">
&s;uch auxiliary aid, might &s;eem le&s;s intere&s;ting: yet we may ob&s;erve, that, to become well acquainted with exotic Natural Hi&s;tory, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine that of Europe. In England, like other northern countries, Nature a&s;&s;umes a grave a&s;pect, but yet pre&s;ents an unbounded &s;ource of amu&s;ement and information to the intelligent mind; and mu&s;t merit the inquiries of learned men, who are inclined to promote knowledge, or feel an intere&s;t in the credit of the country.</P>
<P>Whoever has devoted much lei&s;ure to the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory, will be &s;urprized at the incon&s;iderable number of learned works on that &s;ubject that are in the Engli&s;h lan|guage; and of tho&s;e it may be &s;aid, as Edwards in 1760 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on Natural Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> remarks, that what we have are mo&s;tly tran&s;lations from other languages. This is not, however, the only blame; the arti&s;ts of our country have been condemned for pirating their figures from the works of foreign authors; and it mu&s;t be owned, this has been too frequently practi&s;ed. Since Edwards wrote his book, Botany and Ornithology have undergone great improvements; and the latter in particular, by the writings of Pennant; but more e&s;pecially by Latham, who having added the information of preceding authors to a correct de&s;cription of each Bird, &s;eemed to leave little wanting of a complete Briti&s;h Ornithology, but a &s;eries of accurately coloured Figures of the different Species. To &s;upply this deficiency in particular, has been the aim of the Author of this Work; and he tru&s;ts the Selection of rare Species that he has included in it, will facilitate the &s;tudy of that important and amu&s;ing branch of Natural Hi&s;tory.</P>
