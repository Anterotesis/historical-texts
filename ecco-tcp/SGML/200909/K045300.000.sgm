<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT being peculiarly the bu&s;ine&s;s of a dramatic writer, to
&s;elect tho&s;e popular topics upon which he is a&s;&s;ured of having the
public voice with him, it might na|turally be expected that, after receiving
Your ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious per|mi&s;&s;ion to lay this Dramatic E&s;&s;ay
at Your feet, I &s;hould eagerly have availed my&s;elf of the opportunity thus
given me, of ex|patiating on tho&s;e manners, talents, and virtues, which
con&s;titute &s;o general a theme of admiration. But minds truly <PB REF="3">
con&s;cious of meriting prai&s;e are ever re|&s;erved and delicate in accepting
it: and perhaps Your ROYAL HIGHNESS will not &s;uffer a &s;incere
acknowledgment of merit, becau&s;e the panegyric of Princes has been too often
&s;tained with adulation.</P>
<P>Re&s;trained by this con&s;ideration, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf
with offering my humble acknowledgments for the honour confer|red on me, in the
countenance of my fee|ble endeavours to cultivate an elegant art which &s;o
eminently boa&s;ts the protection of Your ROYAL HIGHNESS.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, Your ROYAL
HIGHNESS's Mo&s;t obedient, And mo&s;t devoted &s;ervant, JAMES COBB.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the STRANGERS AT HOME would think him&s;elf guilty
of great inju&s;tice, if at a moment when the Piece is &s;o highly honoured by
the public approbation, he &s;hould forget how much of that approbation he owes
to the abilities of the Performers, all of whom &s;o kindly intere&s;ted
them&s;elves in its &s;uc|ce&s;s. To Mr. KING he has peculiar obligations, for
the care and attention with which he &s;uperintended the rehear&s;als of the
Opera; and to that Gentleman's judi|cious critici&s;ms he is likewi&s;e highly
indebted. Al|though it might be &s;uperfluous for the Author to add his
prai&s;es to tho&s;e which the public have &s;o liberally and de&s;ervedly
be&s;towed on Mr. LINLEY's Mu&s;ic, he cannot but congratulate him&s;elf on
having had the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;o able a Ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>Once more welcome to European ground, my old &s;on of fun and

<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my boy! and a &s;on who has never di&s;honour'd his family.

<P>And did you really never meet with any misfortune which obliged

<P>Faith, I never remember lamenting but two misfortunes in my
whole life: one, that I was not at the Pru&s;&s;ian re|view; and the other,
that I had not the honour of being among the brave fellows be&s;ieged in
Gibraltar.&mdash;But that's all over now! However, I hope I &s;hall yet live to

<P>Aye, I hardly dare call my&s;elf an Engli&s;hman while I wear
the badges of &s;lavery. Our noble captain, Ibrahim, has kindly pre&s;ented me
with the very cloaths in which I was taken by the Algerines: &s;o, within an
hour, you &s;hall &s;ee me in that character which commands re&s;pect in every
part of the world&mdash;a Briti&s;h &s;oldier!&mdash;and then I &s;hall want
nothing but a mi&s;tre&s;s to make me compleatly happy.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but I would as &s;oon think of buying a friend as a
mi&s;|tre&s;s. Always barter love for love, and friend&s;hip for friend|&s;hip:
for, egad! when either of the commodities are put up to &s;ale, depend upon it
they are not worth buying. However, I don't de&s;pair of making my&s;elf pretty
well under&s;tood by &s;ome kind Florentine girl or other. Love, I take it, is
an univer&s;al language; much the &s;ame in mo&s;t countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURENCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, you will remember, it is a language in which the olde&s;t
&s;cholars are not generally the greate&s;t proficients!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you, young man! But I fear nothing. I am a
mixture of &s;pring and autumn: old Time and I have had &s;o long a battle,
that he has given up the point at la&s;t, and left me ma&s;ter of the field.

<P>The friend of Octavio; in a word, the dumb &s;lave. The ladder

<P>Suppo&s;e, in ca&s;e of a di&s;covery, I were to per&s;onate

<SPEAKER>REGNALTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;ha! a little artifice is often very u&s;eful: 'tis only
retreating from an enemy when he is too powerful for us; and a good pair of
heels is &s;ometimes very &s;erviceable&mdash;Eh! friend Fire|lock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRELOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good pair of heels may be as u&s;eful to a coward as ar|tifice
is to a knave: but hone&s;ty as much de&s;pi&s;es the aid of the one, as
courage di&s;dains the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other!</P>
