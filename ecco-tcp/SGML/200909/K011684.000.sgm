<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;een in the Public New&s;papers the following Adverti&s;ement, to wit&mdash;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Nobility, Gentlemen, Clergy, Free|holder, and other Inhabitants of the County of Surrey.</HEAD>
<P>At the requi&s;ition and de&s;ire of &s;everal of the Freeholders of the County, I am, in the ab&s;ence of the Sheriff, to de&s;ire the favour of your attendance, at a Meeting to be held at Ep&s;om, on Monday the 18th in&s;tant, at 12 o'clock at noon, to con&s;ider of an Humble Ad|dre&s;s to his MAJESTY, to expre&s;s our grateful approbation of his MAJESTY'S paternal and well-timed attention to the public welfare, in his late mo&s;t gracious Proclamation again&s;t the Enemies of our happy Con&s;titution.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>(Signed) ONSLOW CRANLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Taking it for granted, that the afore&s;aid Ad|verti&s;ement, equally as ob&s;cure as the Proclama|tion
<PB N="4" REF="3">to which it refers, has neverthele&s;s &s;ome meaning, and is intended to effect &s;ome purpo&s;e; and as a pro&s;ecution (whether wi&s;ely or unwi&s;ely, ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly) is already commenced again&s;t a work intitled <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> of which I have the honour and the happine&s;s to be the author; I feel it nece&s;&s;ary to addre&s;s this Letter to you, and to reque&s;t that it may be read publicly to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet at Ep&s;om in con&s;e|quence of that Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>The work now under pro&s;ecution is, I con|ceive, the &s;ame work which is intended to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by the afore&s;aid Proclamation. Admit|ting this to be the ca&s;e, the Gentlemen of the county of Surrey are called upon by &s;omebody to condemn a work, and they are at the &s;ame time forbidden by the Proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called upon to give their aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to prevent other people from knowing it al&s;o.&mdash;It is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary that the author, for his own ju&s;ti|fication, as well as to prevent the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet from being impo&s;ed upon by mi&s;repre|&s;entation, &s;hould give &s;ome out-lines of the prin|ciples and plans which that work contains.</P>
<P>The work, Sir, in que&s;tion contains, fir&s;t, an inve&s;tigation of general principles of Government.</P>
<P>It al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes Government into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;y&s;tems, the one the hereditary &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the
<PB N="5" REF="4">other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem; and it compares tho&s;e two &s;y&s;tems with each other.</P>
<P>It &s;hews, that what is called Hereditary Go|vernment cannot exi&s;t as a matter of right; be|cau&s;e Hereditary Government always means a Government yet to come; and the ca&s;e always is, that tho&s;e who are to live afterwards have always the &s;ame right to e&s;tabli&s;h a Government for them&s;elves as the People had who lived before them.</P>
<P>It al&s;o &s;hews the defect to which Hereditary Government is unavoidably &s;ubject; that it mu&s;t, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle, or unfitted for it from want of capacity. JAMES the II'd. and many others are recorded in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, as proofs of the former of tho&s;e ca&s;es, and in&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t all over Europe, to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P>It then &s;hews, that the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem is the only true &s;y&s;tem of Government; that it is al&s;o the only &s;y&s;tem under which the liberties of any People can be permanently &s;ecure; and fur|ther, that it is the only one that can continue the &s;ame equal probability at all times of admitting of none but men properly qualified, both by principles and abilities, into the Government, and of excluding &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">The work &s;hews al&s;o, by plans and calcula|tions, not hitherto denied nor controverted, not even by the pro&s;ecution that is commenced, that the taxes now exi&s;ting may be reduced at lea&s;t &s;ix millions, that taxes may be entirely taken off from the Poor, who are computed at one-third of the nation, and that the taxes on the other two-thirds may be very con&s;iderably reduced&mdash;that the aged Poor may be comfortably provided for, and the children of poor families properly educated&mdash;that fifteen thou&s;and &s;oldiers, and the &s;ame number of &s;ailors, may be di&s;banded, and allowed three &s;hillings per week during life out of the &s;urplus taxes; and al&s;o, that a proportionate allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the remaining &s;oldiers and &s;ailors be encrea&s;ed; and that it is better to apply the &s;urplus taxes to tho&s;e purpo&s;es, than to con&s;ume them on lazy and profligate placemen and pen&s;ioners; and that the revenue, &s;aid to be twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, rai&s;ed by a tax upon coals, and given to the Duke of RICHMOND, is a gro&s;s impo&s;ition upon all the people of London, and ought to be in&s;tantly aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a conci&s;e ab&s;tract of the principles and plans contained in the work that is now pro|&s;ecuted, and for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which the Pro|clamation appears to be intended: But as it is impo&s;&s;ible that I can, in the compa&s;s of a letter,
<PB N="7" REF="6">bring into view all the matters contained in the work, and as it is proper that the Gentlemen who may compo&s;e that Meeting &s;hould know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they come to any re&s;olutions, either directly or indi|rectly relating thereto, I reque&s;t the honour of pre&s;enting them with one hundred copies of the &s;econd part of RIGHTS OF MAN, and al&s;o one thou&s;and copies of my letter to Mr. DUNDAS, which I have directed to be &s;ent to Ep&s;om for that purpo&s;e; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of pre&s;enting them to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet on that occa&s;ion, with my &s;incere wi&s;hes for their happine&s;s, and for that of the Nation in general.</P>
<P>Having now clo&s;ed thus much of the &s;ubject of my letter, I next come to &s;peak of what has rela|tion to me per&s;onally. I am well aware of the delicacy that attends it, but the purpo&s;e of calling the Meeting appears to me &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with that ju&s;tice that is always due between man and man, that it is proper I &s;hould (as well on account of the Gentlemen who may meet, as on my own account) explain my&s;elf fully and can|didly thereon.</P>
<P>I have already informed the Gentemen, that a pro&s;ecution is commenced again&s;t a work of which I have the honour and happine&s;s to be the author, and I have good rea&s;ons for believing, that the Proclamation which the Gentlemen are called to
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y">con&s;ider, and to pre&s;ent an Addre&s;s upon, is pur|po&s;ely calculated to give an impre&s;&s;ion to the Jury before whom that matter is to come. In &s;hort, that it is dictating a verdict by proclamation; and I con&s;ider the in&s;tigators of the meeting to be held at Ep&s;om, as aiding and abetting the &s;ame im|proper, and in my opinion illegal purpo&s;e, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I &s;hall now &s;hew.</P>
<P>Had a Meeting been called of the Freeholders of the County of Middle&s;ex, the Gentlemen who had compo&s;ed that Meeting, would have rendered them&s;elves objectionable as per&s;ons to &s;erve on a Jury before whom the judicial ca&s;e was afterwards to come. But by calling a Meeting out of the County of Middle&s;ex, that matter is artfully avoided, and the Gentlemen of Surrey are &s;um|moned, as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the &s;ort of verdict which the in&s;tigators of the Meeting no doubt wi&s;h &s;hould be brought in, and to give countenance to the Jury in &s;o doing.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, With much re&s;pect to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet, Their and your Obedient humble &s;ervant, THOMAS PAINE.</SIGNED>
