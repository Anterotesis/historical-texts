<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Animals of the Hare Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed in the la&s;t chapter a tribe of minute, fierce,
          rapacious animals, I come now to a race of minute animals, of a more harmle&s;s
          and gentle kind, that, without being enemies to any, are preyed upon by all. As
          Nature has fitted the former for ho&s;tility, &s;o it has entirely formed the
          latter for eva&s;ion; and as the one kind &s;ub&s;i&s;t by their courage and
          activity, &s;o the other find &s;afety from their &s;wift|ne&s;s and their
          fears. The Hare is the &s;wifte&s;t animal in the world for the time it
          continues; and few quadrupedes can overtake even the <PB N="2" REF="5"> rabbit
          when it has but a &s;hort way to run. To this cla&s;s al&s;o we may add the
          &s;quirrel, &s;ome|what re&s;embling the hare and rabbit in its form and
          nature, and equally pretty, inoffen&s;ive, and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>If we were methodically to di&s;tingui&s;h animals of the hare kind
          from all others, we might &s;ay that they have but two cutting teeth above and
          two below, that they are covered with a &s;oft downy fur, and that they have a
          bu&s;hy tail. The combination of the&s;e marks might per|haps di&s;tingui&s;h
          them tolerably well; whether from the rat, the beaver, the otter, or any other
          mo&s;t nearly approaching in form. But, as I have declined all method that
          rather tends to embarra&s;s hi&s;tory than enlighten it, I am contented to
          cla&s;s the&s;e animals together for no very preci&s;e rea&s;on, but becau&s;e
          I find a general re&s;emblance between them in their natural ha|bits, and in
          the &s;hape of their heads and body. I call a &s;quirrel an animal of the hare
          kind, be|cau&s;e it is &s;omething like a hare. I call the Paca of the &s;ame
          kind, merely becau&s;e it is more like a rabbit than any other animal I know
          of. In &s;hort, it is fit to erect &s;ome parti|cular &s;tandard in the
          imagination of the reader, to refer him to &s;ome animal that he knows, in
          order to direct him in conceiving the figure of <PB N="3" REF="6"> &s;uch as he
          does not know. Still, however, he &s;hould be apprized that his knowledge will
          be defective without an examination of each par|ticular &s;pecies; and that
          &s;aying an animal is of this or that particular kind is but a very trifling
          part of its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Animals of the hare kind, like all others that feed entirely upon
          vegetables, are inoffen&s;ive and timorous. As Nature furni&s;hes them with a
          mo&s;t abundant &s;upply, they have not that ra|pacity after food remarkable in
          &s;uch as are often &s;tinted in their provi&s;ion. They are extremely active
          and amazingly &s;wift, to which they chiefly owe their protection; for being
          the prey of every voracious animal, they are ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ued. The
          hare, the rabbit, and the &s;quirrel, are placed by Pyerius, in his Treati&s;e
          of Ruminating Animals, among the number of tho&s;e that chew the cud; but how
          far this may be true I will not pretend to determine. Certain it is that their
          lips continually move whether &s;leeping or waking. Neverthele&s;s, they chew
          their meat very much before they &s;wallow it, and for that rea&s;on I &s;hould
          &s;uppo&s;e that it does not want a &s;econd ma&s;tication. All the&s;e animals
          u&s;e their fore-paws like hands; they are remarkably &s;alacious, and are
          furni&s;hed by Nature with more ample powers than mo&s;t others for the
          bu&s;ine&s;s of pro|pagation. <PB N="4" REF="7"> They are &s;o very prolific,
          that were they not thinned by the con&s;tant depredations made upon them by
          mo&s;t other animals, they would quickly over-run the earth.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e the hare is the large&s;t, the mo&s;t per&s;ecuted,
          and the mo&s;t timorous; all its mu&s;cles are formed for &s;wiftne&s;s; and
          all its &s;en&s;es &s;eem only given to direct its flight. It has very large
          prominent eyes, placed back|wards in its head, &s;o that it can almo&s;t &s;ee
          be|hind it as it runs. The&s;e are never wholly clo&s;ed; but as the animal is
          continually upon the watch, it &s;leeps with them open. The ears are &s;till
          more remarkable for their &s;ize; they are moveable and capable of being
          directed to every quarter; &s;o that the &s;malle&s;t &s;ounds are readily
          received, and the animal's motions di|rected accordingly. The mu&s;cles of the
          body are very &s;trong, and without fat, &s;o that it may be &s;aid to carry no
          &s;uperfluous burthen of fle&s;h about it; the hinder feet are longer than the
          fore, which &s;till adds to the rapidity of its mo|tions; and almo&s;t all
          animals that are remark|able for their &s;peed, except the hor&s;e, are formed
          in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>An animal &s;o well formed for a life of e&s;cape might be
          &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy a &s;tate of tolerable &s;ecurity; but as every rapacious
          creature is its <PB N="5" REF="8"> enemy, it but very &s;eldom lives out its
          natural term. Dogs of all kinds pur&s;ue it by in&s;tinct, and follow the hare
          more eagerly than any other animal. The cat and the wea&s;el kinds are
          con|tinually lying in ambu&s;h, and practi&s;ing all their little arts to
          &s;eize it; birds of prey are &s;till more dangerous enemies, as again&s;t them
          no &s;wiftne&s;s can avail, nor retreat &s;ecure; but man, an ene|my far more
          powerful than all, prefers its fle&s;h to that of other animals, and de&s;troys
          greater numbers than all the re&s;t. Thus pur&s;ued and per&s;ecuted on every
          &s;ide, the race would long &s;ince have been totally extirpated, did it not
          find a re&s;ource in its amazing fertility.</P>
<P>The hare multiplies exceedingly; it is in a &s;tate of engendering
          at a few months old; the females go with young but thirty days, and ge|nerally
          bring forth three or four at a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon. vol.
              xiii. p. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. As &s;oon as they have produced their young they
          are again ready for conception, and thus do not lo&s;e any time in continuing
          the breed. But they are in another re&s;pect fitted in an extraordinary manner
          for multiplying their kind; for the fe|male, from the conformation of her womb,
          is often &s;een to bring forth, and yet to continue pregnant at the &s;ame
          time; or, in other words, to have young ones of different ages in her 
          <PB N="6" REF="9"> womb together. Other animals never receive the male when
          pregnant, but bring forth their young at once. But it is frequently different
          with the hare; the female often, though already impregnated, admitting the
          male, and thus re|ceiving a &s;econd impregnation. The rea&s;on of this
          extraordinary circum&s;tance is, that the womb in the&s;e animals is divided in
          &s;uch a manner that it may be con&s;idered as a double organ, one &s;ide of
          which may be filled while the other remains empty. Thus the&s;e animals may be
          &s;een to couple at every period of their pregnancy, and even while they are
          bringing forth young laying the foundation of another brood.</P>
<P>The young of the&s;e animals are brought forth with their eyes open,
          and the dam &s;uckles them for twenty days, after which they leave her, and
          &s;eek out for them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p.
              12.</BIBL></NOTE>. From this we ob&s;erve, that the education the&s;e animals
          re|ceive is but trifling, and the family connexion but of &s;hort duration. In
          the rapacious kinds the dam leads her young forth for months to|gether; teaches
          them the arts of rapine; and, although &s;he wants milk to &s;upply them, yet
          keeps them under her care until they are able to hunt for them&s;elves. But a
          long connexion of this kind would be very unnece&s;&s;ary as well 
          <PB N="7" REF="10"> as dangerous to the timid animals we are de|&s;cribing;
          their food is ea&s;ily procured; and their a&s;&s;ociations, in&s;tead of
          protection, would only expo&s;e them to their pur&s;uers. They &s;eldom,
          however, &s;eparate far from each other, or from the place where they were
          produced; but make each a form at &s;ome di&s;tance, having a predi|lection
          rather for the place than each other's &s;o|ciety. They feed during the night
          rather than by day, chu&s;ing the mo&s;t tender blades of gra&s;s, and
          quenching their thir&s;t with the dew. They live al&s;o upon roots, leaves,
          fruits and corn, and prefer &s;uch plants as are furni&s;hed with a milky
          juice. They al&s;o &s;trip the bark of trees during the winter, there being
          &s;carce any that they will not feed on, except the lime or the alder. They are
          particularly fond of birch, pinks, and par&s;ley. When they are kept tame, they
          are fed with lettuce and other garden herbs; but the fle&s;h of &s;uch as are
          thus brought up is always indifferent.</P>
<P>They &s;leep or repo&s;e in their forms by day, and may be &s;aid to
          live only by night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p.
              12.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is then that they go forth to feed and couple. They do
          not pair, however, but in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, which begins in February; the
          male pur&s;ues and di&s;covers the female by the &s;agacity <PB N="8" REF="11">
          of its no&s;e. They are then &s;een, by moon|light, playing, &s;kipping, and
          pur&s;uing each other; but the lea&s;t motion, the &s;lighte&s;t breeze, the
          falling of a leaf is &s;ufficient to di&s;turb their revels; they in&s;tantly
          fly off, and each takes a &s;eparate way.</P>
<P>As their limbs are made for running, they ea&s;ily out&s;trip all
          other animals in the beginning; and could they pre&s;erve their &s;peed it
          would be impo&s;&s;ible to overtake them; but as they ex|hau&s;t their
          &s;trength at their fir&s;t efforts, and double back to the place they were
          &s;tarted from, they are more ea&s;ily taken than the fox, which is a much
          &s;lower animal than they. As their hind legs are longer than the fore, they
          always chu&s;e to run up hill, by which the &s;peed of their pur&s;uers is
          dimini&s;hed while theirs remains the &s;ame. Their motions are al&s;o without
          any noi&s;e, as they have the &s;ole of the foot furni&s;hed with hair; and
          they &s;eem the only animals that have hair on the in&s;ide of their
          mouths.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom live above &s;even or eight years at the utmo&s;t;
          they come to their full perfec|tion in a year; and this multiplied by &s;even,
          as in other animals, gives the extent of their lives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xiii. p. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is &s;aid,
          however, that the females live longer than the males: of this Mr. Buffon makes
          a <PB N="9" REF="12"> doubt; but I am a&s;&s;ured that it is &s;o. They pa&s;s
          their lives, in our climate, in &s;olitude and &s;ilence; and they &s;eldom are
          heard to cry, ex|cept when they are &s;eized or wounded. Their voice is not
          &s;o &s;harp as the note of &s;ome other animals, but more nearly approaching
          that of the &s;qualling of a child. They are not &s;o wild as their
          di&s;po&s;itions and their habits &s;eem to in|dicate; but are of a complying
          nature, and ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of a kind of education. They are ea&s;ily
          tamed. They even become fond and ca|re&s;&s;ing, but they are incapable of
          attachment to any particular per&s;on, and never can be de|pended upon; for,
          though taken never &s;o young, they regain their native freedom at the fir&s;t
          opportunity. As they have a remarkable good ear, and &s;it upon their hind
          legs, and u&s;e their fore-paws as hands, they have been taught to beat the
          drum, to dance to mu&s;ic, and go through the manual exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>But their natural in&s;tincts for their pre&s;erva|tion are much
          more extraordinary than tho&s;e artificial tricks that are taught them. They
          make them&s;elves a form particularly in tho&s;e places where the colour of the
          gra&s;s mo&s;t re|&s;embles that of their &s;kin; it is open to the &s;outh in
          winter and to the north in &s;ummer. The hare, when it hears the hounds at a
          di|&s;tance, <PB N="10" REF="13"> flies for &s;ome time through a natural
          impul&s;e, without managing its &s;trength, or con&s;ulting any other means but
          &s;peed for its &s;afety. Having attained &s;ome hill or ri&s;ing ground, and
          left the dogs &s;o far behind that it no longer hears their cries, it &s;tops,
          rears on its hinder legs, and at length looks back to &s;ee if it has not
          lo&s;t its pur&s;uers. But the&s;e, having once fallen upon the &s;cent,
          pur&s;ue &s;lowly and with united &s;kill, and the poor animal &s;oon again
          hears the fatal tidings of their approach. Sometimes when &s;ore hunted it will
          &s;tart a fre&s;h hare, and &s;quat in the &s;ame form; &s;ometimes it will
          creep under the door of a &s;heep-cot, and hide among the &s;heep; &s;ometimes
          it will run among them, and no vigilance can drive it from the flock; &s;ome
          will enter holes like the rabbit, which the hunters call going to
          <HI>vault</HI>; &s;ome will go up one &s;ide of the hedge and come down the
          other; and it has been known that an hare &s;orely hunted has got upon the top
          of a cut quick-&s;et hedge, and run a good way there|on, by which it has
          effectually evaded the hounds. It is no unu&s;ual thing al&s;o for them to
          betake them&s;elves to furz bu&s;hes, and to leap from one to another, by which
          the dogs are frequently mi&s;led. However, the fir&s;t doubling an hare makes
          is generally a key to <PB N="11" REF="14"> all its future attempts of that
          kind, the latter being exactly like the former. The young hares tread heavier,
          and leave a &s;tronger &s;cent than the old, becau&s;e their limbs are weaker;
          and the more this forlorn creature tires, the heavier it treads, and the
          &s;tronger is the &s;cent it leaves. A buck, or male hare, is known by its
          chu&s;ing to run upon hard highways, feeding farther from the wood-&s;ides and
          making its doublings of a greater compa&s;s than the female. The male having
          made a turn or two about its form, frequently leads the hounds five or &s;ix
          miles on a &s;tretch; but the female keeps clo&s;e by &s;ome covert &s;ide,
          turns, cro&s;&s;es, and winds among the bu&s;hes like a rabbit, and &s;eldom
          runs directly forward. In general, however, both male and female regulate their
          conduct according to the weather. In a moi&s;t day they hold by the high|ways
          more than at any other time, becau&s;e the &s;cent is then &s;tronge&s;t upon
          the gra&s;s. If they come to the &s;ide of a grove or &s;pring they for|bear to
          enter, but &s;quat down by the &s;ide thereof until the hounds have over&s;hot
          them; and then, turning along their former path, make to their old form, from
          which they vainly hope for pro|tection.</P>
<P>Hares are divided, by the hunters, into mountain and mea&s;led
          hares. The former are <PB N="12" REF="15"> more &s;wift, vigorous, and have
          their fle&s;h better ta&s;ted; the latter chiefly frequent the mar&s;hes, when
          hunted keep among low grounds, and their fle&s;h is moi&s;t, white, and flabby.
          When the male and female keep one particular &s;pot, they will not &s;uffer any
          &s;trange hare to make its form in the &s;ame quarter, &s;o that it is
          u&s;ually &s;aid that the more you hunt the more hares you &s;hall have; for,
          having killed one hare, others come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its form.
          Many of the&s;e animals are found to live in woods and thickets, but they are
          naturally fonder of the open country, and are con&s;trained only by fear to
          take &s;helter in places that afford them neither a warm &s;un nor an agreeable
          pa&s;ture. They are therefore, u&s;ually &s;een &s;tealing out of the edges of
          the wood to ta&s;te the gra&s;s that grows &s;horter and &s;weeter in the open
          fields than under the &s;hade of the trees; however, they &s;eldom mi&s;s of
          being pur&s;ued; and every excur&s;ion is a new adventure. They are &s;hot at
          by poachers; traced by their foot&s;teps in the &s;now; caught in &s;prings;
          dogs, birds, and cats, are all combined again&s;t them; ants, &s;nakes, and
          adders, drive them from their forms, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer; even fleas, from
          which mo&s;t other animals are free, per&s;ecute this poor creature; and, &s;o
          va|rious are its enemies, that it is &s;eldom permitted <PB N="13" REF="16"> to
          reach even that &s;hort term to which it is li|mited by nature.</P>
<P>The &s;oil and climate have their influence upon this animal as well
          as on mo&s;t others. In the countries bordering on the north pole, they become
          white in winter, and are often &s;een in great troops of four or five hundred,
          running along the banks of the river Irti&s;h, or the Je|ni&s;ca, and as white
          as the &s;now they tread on. They are caught in toils for the &s;ake of their
          &s;kins, which on the &s;pot are &s;old for le&s;s than &s;even &s;hillings an
          hundred. Their fur is well known to form a con&s;iderable article in the hat
          manufacture; and we accordingly import va&s;t quantities of it from tho&s;e
          countries where the hare abounds in &s;uch plenty. They are found al&s;o
          entirely black, but the&s;e in much le&s;s quan|tity than the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Klein Di&s;p. Quadrup. p. 52.</BIBL></NOTE>; and even &s;ome

<P>The hares of the hot countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, and

          <PB N="14" REF="17"> knock them on the head as they come down to the &s;ides of
          the rivers to drink. They al&s;o &s;ur|round the place where they are &s;een in
          numbers, and clattering a &s;hort &s;tick, which every man carries, again&s;t
          that which the per&s;on next him carries, they dimini&s;h their circle
          gradually, till the hares are cooped up in the mid&s;t. They then all together
          throw their &s;ticks in among them, and with &s;uch deadly force, that they
          &s;eldom fail of killing great numbers at a time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tom iv. p. 171.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of this animal has been e&s;teemed as a delicacy among

          Britains, and the Mahometans, all con&s;idered it as an unclean animal, and
          religiou&s;ly ab|&s;tained from it. On the contrary, there are &s;carce any

<HEAD>THE RABBIT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hare and the Rabbit, though &s;o very nearly re&s;embling each
            other in form and di&s;|po&s;ition, are yet di&s;tinct kinds, as they refu&s;e
            to mix with each other. Mr. Buffon bred up &s;everal of both kinds in the
            &s;ame place; but from being at fir&s;t indifferent, they &s;oon be|came
            enemies; and their combats were gene|rally continued until one of them was
            di&s;abled or de&s;troyed. However, though the&s;e experi|ments were not
            attended with &s;ucce&s;s, I am a&s;|&s;ured that nothing is more frequent than
            an animal bred between the&s;e two, which, like all other mules, is marked with
            &s;terility. Nay, it has been actually known that the rabbit couples with
            animals of a much more di&s;tant nature; and there is at pre&s;ent in the
            Mu&s;eum at Bru&s;|&s;els, a creature covered with feathers and hair, and
            &s;aid to be bred between a rabbit and an hen.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">The fecundity of the rabbit is &s;till greater
            than that of the hare; and if we &s;hould calculate the produce from a &s;ingle
            pair, in one year, the number would be amazing. They breed &s;even times in a
            year, and bring eight young ones each time. On a &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore,
            that this happens regularly, at the end of four years, a couple of rabbits
            &s;hall &s;ee a progeny of almo&s;t a million and an half. From hence we might
            ju&s;tly apprehend being over&s;tocked by their encrea&s;e; but, happily for
            mankind, their enemies are numerous, and their nature inoffen&s;ive; &s;o that
            their de&s;truction bears a near proportion to their fertility.</P>
<P>But although their numbers be dimini&s;hed by every bea&s;t and
            bird of prey, and &s;till more by man him&s;elf, yet there is no danger of
            their ex|tirpation. The hare is a poor defencele&s;s animal, that has nothing
            but its &s;wiftne&s;s to depend on for &s;afety; its numbers are, therefore,
            every day de|crea&s;ing; and in countries that are well peopled, the &s;pecies
            are &s;o much kept under, that laws are made for their pre&s;ervation. Still,
            however, it is mo&s;t likely that they will be at la&s;t totally de|&s;troyed;
            and, like the wolf or the elk in &s;ome countries, be only kept in remembrance.
            But it is otherwi&s;e with the rabbit, its fecundity being greater, and its
            means of &s;afety more certain. <PB N="17" REF="20"> The hare &s;eems to have
            more various arts and in&s;tincts to e&s;cape its pur&s;uers, by doubling,
            &s;quatting, and winding; the rabbit has but one art of defence alone, but in
            that one finds &s;afety; by making it&s;elf a hole, where it con|tinues a great
            part of the day, and breeds up its young; there it continues &s;ecure from the
            fox, the hound, the kite, and every other enemy.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, though this retreat be &s;afe and convenient, the
            rabbit does not &s;eem to be naturally fond of keeping there. It loves the
            &s;unny field and the open pa&s;ture; it &s;eems to be a chilly animal, and
            di&s;likes the coldne&s;s of its under-ground habitation. It is, therefore,
            continually out, when it does not fear di&s;turb|ance; and the female often
            brings forth her young, at a di&s;tance from the warren, in an hole, not above
            a foot deep at the mo&s;t. There &s;he &s;uckles them for about a month;
            covering them over with mo&s;s and gra&s;s, when|ever &s;he goes to pa&s;ture,
            and &s;cratching them up at her return. It has been &s;aid, indeed, that this
            &s;hallow hole without the warren, is made le&s;t the male &s;hould attack and
            de&s;troy her young; but I have &s;een the male him&s;elf attend the young
            there, lead them out to feed, and conduct them back upon the return of the dam.
            This external retreat &s;eems a kind of <PB N="18" REF="21"> country hou&s;e,
            at a di&s;tance from the general habitation; it is u&s;ually made near &s;ome
            &s;pot of excellent pa&s;ture, or in the mid&s;t of a field of &s;prouting
            corn. To this both male and fe|male often retire from the warren; lead their
            young by night to the food which lies &s;o con|venient, and, if not
            di&s;turbed, continue there till they are perfectly grown up. There they find a
            greater variety of pa&s;ture than near the warren, which is generally eaten
            bare; and en|joy a warmer &s;un, by covering them&s;elves up in a &s;hallower
            hole. Whenever they are di&s;tur|bed, they then for&s;ake their retreat of
            plea&s;ure, for one of &s;afety; they fly to the warren with their utmo&s;t
            &s;peed; and, if the way be &s;hort, there is &s;carce any dog, how &s;wift
            &s;oever, that can overtake them.</P>
<P>But it does not always happen that the&s;e animals are
            po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one of the&s;e external apartments; they mo&s;t u&s;ually
            bring forth their young in the warren, but always in a hole, &s;e|parate from
            the male. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the female digs her&s;elf an hole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, different from the ordinary one, by
            being more intricate; at the bottom of which &s;he makes a more ample
            apartment. This done, &s;he pulls off from her belly a good quantity of her
            hair, with which &s;he <PB N="19" REF="22"> makes a kind of bed for her young.
            During the two fir&s;t days &s;he never leaves them; and does not &s;tir out
            but to procure nouri&s;hment, which &s;he takes with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch;
            in this manner &s;uckling her young, for near &s;ix weeks, until they are
            &s;trong, and able to go abroad them&s;elves. During all this time, the male
            &s;eldom vi&s;its their &s;eparate apartment; but when they are grown up, &s;o
            as to come to the mouth of the hole, he then &s;eems to acknow|ledge them as
            his offspring, takes them be|tween his paws, &s;mooths their &s;kin, and licks
            their eyes; all of them, one after the other, have an equal &s;hare in his
            care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In this manner the rabbit, when wild, con|&s;ults its plea&s;ure
            and its &s;afety; but tho&s;e that are bred up tame, do not take the trouble of
            digging an hole, con&s;cious of being already protected. It has al&s;o been
            ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, that when
            people, to make a warren, &s;tock it with tame rabbits, the&s;e animals, having
            been un|accu&s;tomed to the art of &s;craping an hole, con|tinue expo&s;ed to
            the weather, and every other accident, without ever burrowing. Their im|mediate
            offspring al&s;o are equally regardle&s;s of their &s;afety; and it is not till
            after two or three generations, that the&s;e animals begin to find 
            <PB N="20" REF="23"> the nece&s;&s;ity and convenience of an a&s;ylum, and
            practi&s;e an art which they could only learn from nature.</P>
<P>Rabbits of the dome&s;tic breed, like all other animals that are
            under the protection of man, are of various colours; white, brown, black, and
            mou&s;e colour. The black are the mo&s;t &s;carce; the brown, white, and
            mou&s;e colour, are in greater plenty. Mo&s;t of the wild rabbits are of a
            brown, and it is the colour which pre|vails among the &s;pecies; for, in every
            ne&s;t of rabbits, whether the parents be black or white, there are &s;ome
            brown ones found of the number. But, in England, there are many warrens
            &s;tocked with the mou&s;e colour kinds, which &s;ome &s;ay came originally
            from an i&s;land in the river Humber, and which &s;till continue their original
            colour, after a great number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. A gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Moutier, as quoted by Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>,
            who bred up tame rabbits for his amu&s;ement, gives the following account of
            their production. I began, &s;ays he, by having but one male and female only;
            the male was entirely white, and the female brown; but, in their po&s;terity,
            the number of the brown by far exceeded tho&s;e of any other colour: there were
            &s;ome white, &s;ome party-coloured, and &s;ome black. It is &s;ur|prizing 
            <PB N="21" REF="24"> how much the de&s;cendants were obe|dient and
            &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their common parent; he was ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from
            the re&s;t by his &s;uperior whitene&s;s; and, however numerous the other males
            were, this kept them all in &s;ub|jection. Whenever they quarrelled among each
            other, either for their females or pro|vi&s;ions, as &s;oon as he heard the
            noi&s;e he ran up to them with all di&s;patch, and, upon his ap|pearance, all
            was in&s;tantly reduced to peace and order. If he caught any of them in the
            fact, he in&s;tantly puni&s;hed them, as an example to the re&s;t. Another
            in&s;tance of his &s;uperiority was, that having accu&s;tomed them to come to
            me with the call of a whi&s;tle, the in&s;tant this &s;ignal was given, I &s;aw
            him mar&s;halling them up, leading them the foremo&s;t, and then &s;uffering
            them all to file off before him.</P>
<P>The rabbit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Moutier, as quoted by
                Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, though le&s;s than the hare, ge|nerally lives
            longer. As the&s;e animals pa&s;s the greater part of their lives in their
            burrow, where they continue at ea&s;e and unmole&s;ted, they have nothing to
            prevent the regularity of their health, or the due cour&s;e of their
            nouri&s;h|ment. They are, therefore, generally found fatter than the hare; but
            their fle&s;h is, notwith|&s;tanding, much le&s;s delicate. That of the 
            <PB N="22" REF="25"> old ones, in particular, is hard, tough and dry; but it is
            &s;aid, that, in warmer countries, they are better ta&s;ted. This may very well
            be, as the rabbit, though &s;o very plenty in Great Britain and Ireland, is,
            neverthele&s;s, a native of the warmer climates; and has been originally
            imported into the&s;e kingdoms, from Spain. In that country, and in &s;ome of
            the i&s;lands in the Mediterranean, we are told, that they once multiplied in
            &s;uch numbers as to prove the greate&s;t nui&s;ance to the natives. They at
            fir&s;t demanded military aid to de&s;troy them; but &s;oon after they called
            in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ferrets, which originally came from Africa, and
            the&s;e, with much more ea&s;e and expedition, contrived to le&s;&s;en the
            calamity. In fact, rabbits are found to love a warm climate, and to be
            inca|pable of bearing the cold of the north; &s;o that in Sweden they are
            obliged to be littered in the hou&s;es. It is otherwi&s;e in all the tropical
            cli|mates, where they are extremely common, and where they &s;eldom burrow, as
            with us. The Engli&s;h countries that are mo&s;t noted for the&s;e animals, are
            Lincoln&s;hire, Norfolk, and Cam|bridge&s;hire. They delight in grounds of a
            &s;andy &s;oil, which are warmer than tho&s;e of clay; and which al&s;o
            furni&s;h a &s;ofter and finer pa&s;ture.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">The tame rabbits are larger than the wild
            ones, from their taking more nouri&s;hment, and u&s;ing le&s;s exerci&s;e; but
            their fle&s;h is not &s;o good, being more in&s;ipid and &s;ofter. In order to
            im|prove it, they are chiefly fed upon bran, and are &s;tinted in their water;
            for, if indulged in too great a plenty of moi&s;t food, they are apt, as the
            feeders expre&s;s it, to grow rotten. The hair or fur is a very u&s;eful
            commodity, and is employed in England for &s;everal purpo&s;es, as well when
            the &s;kin is dre&s;&s;ed with it on, as when it is pulled off. The &s;kins,
            e&s;pecially the white, are u&s;ed for lining cloaths, and are con&s;idered as
            a cheap imitation of ermine. The &s;kin of the male is u&s;ually preferred, as
            being the mo&s;t la&s;ting, but it is coar&s;er; that on the belly in either
            &s;ex, is the be&s;t and fine&s;t. But the chief u&s;e made of rabbit's fur, is
            in the manufacture of hats; it is always mixed, in certain propor|tions, with
            the fur of the beaver; and it is &s;aid to give the latter more &s;trength and
            con&s;i&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>The Syrian rabbit, like all other animals bred in that country, is
            remarkable for the length of its hair; it falls along the &s;ides in wavy
            wreaths, and is, in &s;ome places, curled at the end, like wool; it is &s;hed
            once a year in large ma&s;&s;es; and it often happens that the rabbit, dragging
            a <PB N="24" REF="27"> part of its robe on the ground, appears as if it had got
            another leg, or a longer tail. There are no rabbits naturally in America;
            however, tho&s;e that have been carried from Europe, are found to multiply in
            the We&s;t India i&s;lands in great abundance. In other parts of that
            con|tinent, they have animals that in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble the rabbits
            of Europe; and which mo&s;t European travellers have often called hares or
            rabbits, as they happened to be large or &s;mall. Their giving them even the
            name will be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for my placing them among animals of the
            hare kind; although they may differ in many of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential
            particulars. But before we go to the new continent, we will fir&s;t examine
            &s;uch as bear even a di&s;tant re&s;emblance to the hare kind at home.</P>

            with &s;horter ears, and a longer tail. The tail, indeed, is alone &s;ufficient
            to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others, as it is extremely long, beautiful and
            bu&s;hy, <PB N="25" REF="28"> &s;preading like a fan, and which, when thrown up
            behind, covers the whole body. This &s;erves the little animal for a double
            purpo&s;e; when erected, it &s;erves, like an umbrella, as a &s;e|cure
            protection from the injuries of the heat and cold; and when extended, it is
            very in&s;tru|mental in promoting the&s;e va&s;t leaps that the &s;quirrel
            takes from tree to tree: nay, &s;ome a&s;|&s;ert that it an&s;wers &s;till a
            third purpo&s;e, and when the &s;quirrel takes water, which it &s;ome|times

<P>There are few wild animals in which there are &s;o many varieties
            as in the &s;quirrel. The <HI>common &s;quirrel</HI> is of the &s;ize of a
            &s;mall rabbit, and is rather of a more reddi&s;h brown. The belly and brea&s;t
            are white; and the ears beau|tifully ornamented with long tufts of hair, of a
            deeper colour than that on the body. The eyes are large, black and lively; the
            legs are &s;hort and mu&s;cular, like tho&s;e of the rabbit; but the toes
            longer, and the claws &s;harper, &s;o as to fit it for climbing. When it eats,
            or dre&s;&s;es it&s;elf, it &s;its erect, like the hare or rab|bit, making
            u&s;e of its fore legs as hands; and chiefly re&s;ides in trees. The <HI>grey
            Virginian &s;quir|rel,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the Petit Gris, is 
            <PB N="26" REF="29"> larger than a rabbit, and of a greyi&s;h colour. Its body
            and limbs are thicker than tho&s;e of the common &s;quirrel; and its ears are
            &s;horter, and without tufts at the point. The upper part of the body, and
            external part of the legs, are of a fine whiti&s;h grey, with a beautiful red
            &s;treak on each &s;ide lengthways. The tail is covered with very long grey
            hair, variegated with black and white towards the extremity. This variety
            &s;eems to be common to both continents; and in Sweden is &s;een to change
            colour in winter. The <HI>Barbary &s;quirrel,</HI> of which Mr. Buffon makes
            three varieties, is of a mixed colour, between red and black. Along the &s;ides
            there are white and brown lines, which render this animal very beautiful; but
            what &s;till adds to its elegance is, that the belly is of a &s;ky blue,
            &s;urrounded with white. Some of the&s;e hold up the tail erect; and others
            throw it forward over their body. The <HI>Siberian white &s;quirrel</HI> is of
            the &s;ize of a common &s;quirrel. The <HI>Carolina black &s;quirrel</HI> is
            much bigger than the former, and &s;ometimes tipt with white at all the
            extremities. The <HI>Bra&s;ilian &s;quirrel,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the
            Coquallin, is a beautiful animal of this kind, and very remarkable for the
            variety of its colours. Its belly is of a bright yellow; its head and body
            variegated with white, black, <PB N="27" REF="30"> brown and orange colour. It
            wants the tufts at the extremity of its ears; and does not climb trees, as
            mo&s;t of the kind are &s;een to do. To this li&s;t may be added the <HI>little
            ground &s;quirrel of Carolina,</HI> of a reddi&s;h colour, and blacki&s;h
            &s;tripes on each &s;ide; and, like the former, not delighting in trees.
            La&s;tly, the <HI>&s;quirrel of New Spain,</HI> which is of a deep iron-grey
            colour, with &s;even longitudinal whiti&s;h &s;treaks along the &s;ides of the
            male, and five along tho&s;e of the female. As for the flying &s;quirrels, they
            are a di&s;tinct kind, and &s;hall be treated of by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be but a few of the numerous
            varieties of the &s;quirrel, &s;uf|ficiently &s;erve to &s;hew how
            exten&s;ively this animal is diffu&s;ed over all parts of the world. It is not
            to be &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that every variety is capable of &s;u&s;taining
            every climate; for few animals are &s;o tender, or &s;o little able to endure a
            change of abode, as this. Tho&s;e bred in the tropical climates, will only live
            near a warm &s;un; while, on the contrary, the &s;quirrel of Siberia will
            &s;carce endure the tem|perature of ours. The&s;e varieties do not only differ
            in their con&s;titutions and colour, but in their di&s;po&s;itions al&s;o; for
            while &s;ome live on the tops of trees, others feed, like rabbits, 
            <PB N="28" REF="31"> on vegetables below. Whether any of the&s;e, &s;o
            variou&s;ly coloured, and &s;o differently di&s;|po&s;ed, would breed among
            each other, we can|not tell: and &s;ince, therefore, we are left in uncertainty
            upon this point, we are at liberty either to con&s;ider each as a di&s;tinct
            &s;pecies by it&s;elf; or only a variety, that accident might have originally
            produced, and that the climate or &s;oil might have continued. For my own part,
            as the original character of the &s;quirrel is &s;o &s;trongly marked upon them
            all, I cannot help con&s;idering them in the latter point of view; rather as
            the common de&s;cendants of one parent, than originally formed with &s;uch
            di&s;tinct &s;imilitudes.</P>
<P>The &s;quirrel is a beautiful little animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, which is but half &s;avage; and
            which, from the gentlene&s;s and innocence of its manners, de|&s;erves our
            protection. It is neither carnivorous nor hurtful; its u&s;ual food is fruits,
            nuts and acorns; it is cleanly, nimble, active, and in|du&s;trious; its eyes
            are &s;parkling, and its phy&s;i|ognomy marked with meaning. It generally, like
            the hare and rabbit, &s;its up on its hinder legs, and u&s;es the fore paws as
            hands; the&s;e have five claws or toes, as they are called, and one of them is
            &s;eparated from the re&s;t like a <PB N="29" REF="32"> thumb. This animal
            &s;eems to approach the nature of birds, from its lightne&s;s, and
            &s;ur|prizing agility on the tops of trees. It &s;eldom de&s;cends to the
            ground, except in ca&s;e of &s;torms, but jumps from one branch to another;
            feeds, in &s;pring, on the buds and young &s;hoots; in &s;ummer, on the
            ripening fruits; and par|ticularly the young cones of the pine-tree. In autumn
            it has an exten&s;ive variety to fea&s;t upon; the acorn, the philberd, the
            che&s;tnut, and the wilding. This &s;ea&s;on of plenty, however, is not &s;pent
            in idle enjoyment; the provident little animal gathers at that time its
            provi&s;ions for the winter; and cautiou&s;ly fore&s;ees the &s;ea|&s;on when
            the fore&s;t &s;hall be &s;tripped of its leaves and fruitage</P>
<P>Its ne&s;t is generally formed among the large branches of a great
            tree, where they begin to fork off into &s;mall ones. After chu&s;ing the place
            where the timber begins to decay, and an hollow may the more ea&s;ily be
            formed, the &s;quirrel begins by making a kind of level be|tween the forks; and
            then bringing mo&s;s, twigs, and dry leaves, it binds them together with great
            art, &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t violent &s;torm. This is covered up on
            all &s;ides; and has but a &s;ingle opening at top, which is ju&s;t large
            enough to admit the little animal; and <PB N="30" REF="33"> this opening is
            it&s;elf defended from the wea|ther by a kind of canopy, made in the fa&s;hion
            of a cone, &s;o that it throws off the rain, though never &s;o heavy. The
            ne&s;t thus formed, with a very little opening above, is, neverthele&s;s, very
            commodious and roomy below; &s;oft, well knit together, and every way
            convenient and warm. In this retreat the little animal brings forth its young,
            &s;helters it&s;elf from the &s;corching heat of the &s;un, which it &s;eems to
            fear, and from the &s;torms and the inclemency of winter, which it is &s;till
            le&s;s capable of &s;upporting. Its provi&s;ion of nuts and acorns is &s;eldom
            in its ne&s;t, but in the hollows of the tree, laid up carefully to|gether, and
            never touched but in ca&s;es of ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Thus one &s;ingle tree &s;erves
            for a retreat and a &s;tore-hou&s;e; and without leaving it during the winter,
            the &s;quirrel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all tho&s;e enjoy|ments that its nature is
            capable of receiving. But it &s;ometimes happens that its little man&s;ion is
            attacked by a deadly and powerful foe. The martin goes often in que&s;t of a
            retreat for its young, which it is incapable of making for it&s;elf; for this
            rea&s;on it fixes upon the ne&s;t of a &s;quirrel, and, with double
            inju&s;tice, de&s;troys the tenant, and then takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
            man&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, this is a calamity that but &s;eldom <PB N="31" REF="34">
            happens: and, of all other animals, the &s;quirrel leads the mo&s;t
            frolick&s;ome playful life; being &s;urrounded with abundance, and having few
            enemies to fear. They are in heat early in the &s;pring; when, as a modern
            naturali&s;t &s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h
                Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, it is very diverting to &s;ee the female feigning an
            e&s;cape from the pur&s;uit of two or three males, and to ob&s;erve the various
            proofs which they give of their agility, which is then exerted in full force.
            Nature &s;eems to have been particular in her formation of the&s;e animals for
            propagation: however, they &s;eldom bring forth above four or five young at a
            time; and that but once a year. The time of their ge&s;tation &s;eems to be
            about &s;ix weeks; they are pregnant in the be|ginning of April, and bring
            forth about the middle of May.</P>
<P>The &s;quirrel is never found in the open fields, nor yet in
            cop&s;es or underwoods; it always keeps in the mid&s;t of the talle&s;t trees,
            and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;huns the habitations of men. It is extremely
            watchful; if the tree in which it re&s;ides be but touched at the bottom, the
            &s;quir|rel in&s;tantly takes the alarm, quits its ne&s;t, at once flies off to
            another tree, and thus travels, with great ea&s;e, along the tops of the
            fore&s;t, until it finds it&s;elf perfectly out of danger. In 
            <PB N="32" REF="35"> this manner it continues for &s;ome hours at a di&s;tance
            from home, until the alarm be pa&s;t away; and then it returns, by paths that
            to all quadrupedes but it&s;elf are utterly impa&s;&s;able. Its u&s;ual way of
            moving is by bounds; the&s;e it takes from one tree to another, at forty feet
            di&s;tance; and if at any time it is obliged to de|&s;cend, it runs up the
            &s;ide of the next tree with amazing facility. It has an extremely &s;harp
            piercing note, which mo&s;t u&s;ually expre&s;&s;es pain; it has another, more
            like the purring of a cat, which it employs when plea&s;ed; at lea&s;t it
            ap|peared &s;o in that from whence I have taken a part of this
            de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In Lapland, and the exten&s;ive fore&s;ts to the north, the
            &s;quirrels are ob&s;erved to change their habitation, and to remove in va&s;t
            numbers from one country to another. In the&s;e mi|grations they are generally
            &s;een by thou&s;ands, travelling directly forward; while neither rocks,
            fore&s;ts, nor even the broade&s;t waters can &s;top their progre&s;s. What I
            am going to relate, appears &s;o extraordinary, that were it not at|te&s;ted by
            numbers of the mo&s;t credible hi&s;to|rians, among whom are Klein and
            Linnaeus, it might be rejected, with that &s;corn with which we treat

<HEAD>THE FLYING SQUIRREL.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Ray was ju&s;tly of opinion that the Flying Squirrel might
            more properly be &s;aid to be of the rat kind, becau&s;e its fur is &s;horter
            than in other &s;quirrels, and its colours al&s;o more nearly approach the
            former. However, as mankind have been content to cla&s;s it among the
            &s;quir|rels, it is &s;carcely worth making a new di&s;tinc|tion in its favour.
            This little animal, which is frequently brought over to England, is le&s;s than
            a common &s;quirrel and bigger than a field mou&s;e. Its &s;kin is very &s;oft,
            and elegantly adorned with a dark fur in &s;ome places and light grey in
            others. <PB REF="41">

            large prominent black and very &s;parkling eyes, &s;mall ears, and very &s;harp
            teeth, with which it gnaws any thing quickly. When it does not leap, its tail,
            which is pretty enough, lies clo&s;e to its back; but when it takes its
            &s;pring, the tail is moved backwards and for|wards from &s;ide to &s;ide. It
            is &s;aid to partake &s;omewhat of the nature of the &s;quirrel, of the rat,
            and of the dormou&s;e; but that in which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other
            animals, is its peculiar conformation for taking tho&s;e leaps that almo&s;t
            look like flying. It is, indeed, amaz|ing to &s;ee it at one bound dart above
            an hun|dred yards, from one tree to another. They are a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this
            &s;pring by a very peculiar for|mation of the &s;kin, that extends from the
            fore-feet to the hinder; &s;o that when the animal &s;tretches its fore-legs
            forward and its hind-legs backward, this &s;kin is &s;pread out between them,
            &s;omewhat like that between the legs of a bat. The &s;urface of the body being
            thus encrea&s;ed, the little animal keeps buoyant in the air until the force of
            its fir&s;t impul&s;ion is expired, and then it de&s;cends. This &s;kin, when
            the creature is at re&s;t, or walking, continues wrinkled up on its &s;ides;
            but when its limbs are extended, it forms a kind of web between them of above
            an inch broad on either &s;ide, and gives the <PB N="36" REF="45"> whole body
            the appearance of a &s;kin floating in the air. In this manner the flying
            &s;quirrel changes place, not like a bird, by repeated &s;trokes of its wings,
            but rather like a paper kite &s;upported by the expan&s;ion of the &s;urface of
            its body; but with this difference, however, that, being naturally heavier than
            the air, in|&s;tead of mounting it de&s;cends; and that jump which upon the
            ground would not be above forty yards, when from an higher tree to a lower may
            be above an hundred.</P>
<P>This little animal is more common in Ame|rica than in Europe, but
            not very commonly to be &s;een in either. It is u&s;ually found, like the

            plea&s;ed with the &s;prouts of the birch and the cones of the pine. It is fed
            in its tame &s;tate with bread and fruits; it generally &s;leeps by day, and is
            always mo&s;t active by night. Some naturali&s;ts gravely caution us not to let

<P><PB N="37" REF="50">FROM the de&s;cription of the &s;quirrel and
            its varieties we proceed to a different tribe of animals, no way indeed
            re&s;embling the &s;quirrel, but &s;till &s;omething like the rabbit and the
            hare. We are to keep the&s;e two animals &s;till in view as the center of our
            compari&s;on; as objects to which many others may bear &s;ome &s;imilitude,
            though they but little approach each other. Among the hare kind is the Marmout,
            which naturali&s;ts have placed either among the hare kind or the rat kind, as
            it &s;uited their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems. In fact, it bears no great
            re&s;emblance to either; but of the two it approaches much nearer the hare, as
            well in the make of its head as in its &s;ize, in its bu&s;hy tail, and
            particularly in its chewing the cud, which alone is &s;ufficient to determine
            our choice in giving it its pre&s;ent &s;ituation. How it ever came to be
            degraded into the rat or the mou&s;e I cannot conceive, for it no way
            re&s;embles them in &s;ize, being near as <PB REF="51">

            hare; or in its di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ince no animal is more tractable nor more
            ea&s;ily tamed.</P>
<P>The Marmout is, as was &s;aid, almo&s;t as big as an hare, but it
            is more corpulent than a cat, and has &s;horter legs. Its head pretty nearly
            re|&s;embles that of an hare, except that its ears are much &s;horter. It is
            cloathed all over with very long hair, and a &s;horter fur below. The&s;e are
            of different colours, black and grey. The length of the hair gives the body the
            appearance of greater corpulence than it really has, and at the &s;ame time
            &s;hortens the feet &s;o that its belly &s;eems touching the ground. Its tail
            is tufted and well furni&s;hed with hair, and it is carried in a &s;traight
            direction with its body. It has five claws behind and only four before. The&s;e
            it u&s;es as the &s;quirrel does, to carry its food to its mouth; and it
            u&s;ually &s;its upon its hinder parts to feed in the manner of that little
            animal.</P>
<P>The marmout is chiefly a native of the Alps; and when taken young
            is tamed more ea&s;ily than any other wild animal, and almo&s;t as perfectly as
            any of tho&s;e that are dome&s;tic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon, from whence

              <BIBL>Ce&s;ner, vol. xvii.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is readily taught to
            dance, to wield a cudgel, and to obey the voice of its ma&s;ter. Like the cat,
            it <PB N="39" REF="54"> has an antipathy to the dog; and when it be|comes
            familiar to the family, and is &s;ure of being &s;upported by its ma&s;ter, it
            attacks and bites even the large&s;t ma&s;tiff. From its &s;quat mu&s;cular
            make, it has great &s;trength joined to great agility. It has four large
            cutting teeth, like all tho&s;e of the hare kind, but it u&s;es them to much
            more advantage, &s;ince in this animal they are very formidable weapons of
            defence. However, it is in general a very inoffen&s;ive animal; and, ex|cept
            its enmity to dogs, &s;eems to live in friend|&s;hip with every creature,
            unle&s;s when provoked. If not prevented, it is very apt to gnaw the furni|ture
            of an hou&s;e, and even to make holes through wooden partitions; from whence,
            perhaps, it has been compared to the rat. As its legs are very &s;hort, and
            made &s;omewhat like tho&s;e of a bear, it is often &s;een &s;itting up, and
            even walk|ing on its hind legs in like manner; but with the fore-paws, as was
            &s;aid, it u&s;es to feed it&s;elf in the manner of a &s;quirrel. Like all of
            the hare kind, it runs much &s;wifter up hill than down; it climbs trees with
            great ea&s;e, and runs up the clefts of rocks, or the contiguous walls of
            hou&s;es, with great facility. It is ludicrou&s;ly &s;aid that the Savoyards,

            country.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals eat indi&s;criminately of what|ever is pre&s;ented
            to them; fle&s;h, bread, fruits, herbs, roots, pul&s;e, and in&s;ects. But they
            are particularly fond of milk and butter. Although le&s;s inclined to petty
            thefts than the cat, yet they always try to &s;teal into the dairy, where they
            lap up the milk like a cat, purring all the while like that animal, as an
            expre&s;&s;ion of their being plea&s;ed. As to the re&s;t, milk is the only
            liquor they like. They &s;eldom drink water, and refu&s;e wine. When plea&s;ed
            or care&s;&s;ed, they often yelp like puppies; but when irritated or frighted,
            they have a piercing note that hurts the ear. They are very cleanly animals,
            and like the cat retire upon nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions; but their bodies have a
            di&s;agreeable &s;cent, parti|cularly in the heat of &s;ummer. This tinctures
            their fle&s;h, which, being very fat and firm, would be very good, were not
            this flavour al|ways found to predominate.</P>
<P>We have hitherto been de&s;cribing affections in this animal which
            it has in common with many others; but we now come to one which particularly
            di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others of this kind, and, indeed, from every
            other qua|drupede except the bat and the dormou&s;e. <PB N="41" REF="58"> This
            is its &s;leeping during the winter. The marmout, though a native of the
            highe&s;t moun|tains, and where the &s;now is never wholly melted,
            neverthele&s;s &s;eems to feel the influence of the cold more than any other,
            and in a man|ner has all its faculties chilled up in winter. This extraordinary
            &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of life and mo|tion for more than half the year, de&s;erves
            our wonder, and excites our attention to con&s;ider the manner of &s;uch a
            temporary death, and the &s;ub&s;equent revival. But fir&s;t to de&s;cribe,
            be|fore we attempt to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>The marmout, u&s;ually at the end of Sep|tember, or the beginning
            of October, prepares to fit up its habitation for the winter, from which it is
            never &s;een to i&s;&s;ue till about the be|ginning or the middle of April.
            This animal's little retreat is made with great precaution, and fitted up with
            art. It is an hole on the &s;ide of a mountain, extremely deep, with a
            &s;pacious apartment at the bottom, which is rather longer than it is broad. In
            this &s;everal marmouts can re&s;ide at the &s;ame time, without crowding each
            other, or injuring the air they breathe. The feet and claws of this animal
            &s;eem made for digging; and, in fact, they burrow into the ground with amazing
            facility, &s;craping up the <PB N="42" REF="59"> earth like a rabbit, and
            throwing back what they have thus loo&s;ened behind them. But the form of their
            hole is &s;till more wonderful; it re&s;embles the letter Y; the two branches
            being two openings, which conduct into one channel which terminates in their
            general apartment that lies at the bottom. As the whole is made on the
            declivity of a mountain, there is no part of it on a level but the apartment at
            the end. One of the branches or openings i&s;&s;ues out, &s;loping downwards;
            and this &s;erves as a kind of &s;ink or drain to the whole family, where they
            make their excrements, and where the moi&s;ture of the place is drawn away. The
            other branch, on the contrary, &s;lopes upwards, and this &s;erves as their
            door upon which to go out and in. The apartment at the end is very warmly
            &s;tuccoed round with mo&s;s and hay, of both which they make an ample
            provi&s;ion dur|ing the &s;ummer. As this is a work of great labour, &s;o it is
            undertaken in common; &s;ome cut the fine&s;t gra&s;s, others gather it, and
            others take their turns to drag it into their hole. Upon this occa&s;ion, as we
            are told, one of them lies on its back, permits the hay to be heaped upon its
            belly, keeps its paws upright to make greater room; and in this manner, lying
            &s;till <PB N="43" REF="60"> upon its back, it is dragged by the tail, hay and
            all, to their common retreat. This al&s;o &s;ome give as a rea&s;on for the
            hair being generally worn away on their backs, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e;
            how|ever, a better rea&s;on for this may be a&s;&s;igned, from their
            continually rooting up holes and pa&s;&s;ing through narrow openings. But, be
            this as it will, certain it is that they all live together, and work in common
            to make their habitation as &s;nug and convenient as po&s;&s;ible. In it they
            pa&s;s three parts of their lives; into it they retire when the &s;torm is
            high; in it they continue while it rains; there they remain when
            apprehen|&s;ive of danger, and never &s;tir out except in fine weather, never
            going far from home even then. Whenever they venture abroad, one is placed as a
            centinel, &s;itting upon a lofty rock, while the re&s;t amu&s;e them&s;elves in
            playing along the green fields, or are employed in cutting gra&s;s and making
            hay for their winter's convenience. Their tru&s;ty centinel, when an enemy, a
            man, a dog, or a bird of prey, approaches, apprizes its companions with a
            whi&s;tle, upon which they all make home, the centinel him&s;elf bringing up
            the rear.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that this hay is de&s;igned for
            provi&s;ion; on the contrary, it is <PB N="42" REF="61">

            found in as great plenty in their holes at the end as at the beginning of
            winter; it is only &s;ought for the convenience of their lodging, and the
            advantages of their young. As to pro|vi&s;ion, they &s;eem kindly apprized by
            Nature that during the winter that they &s;hall not want any, &s;o that they
            make no preparations for food, though &s;o diligently employed in fitting up
            their abode. As &s;oon as they perceive the fir&s;t approaches of the winter,
            during which their vital motions are to continue in &s;ome mea&s;ure
            &s;u&s;pended, they labour very diligently to clo&s;e up the two en|trances of
            their habitation, which they effect with &s;uch &s;olidity, that it is ea&s;ier
            to dig up the earth any where el&s;e than where they have clo&s;ed it. At that
            time they are very fat, and &s;ome of them are found to weigh above twenty
            pounds; they continue &s;o for even three months more; but by degrees their
            fle&s;h begins to wa&s;te, and they are u&s;ually very lean by the end of
            winter. When their retreat is opened, the whole family is then di&s;covered,
            each rolled into a ball, and covered up under the hay. In this &s;tate they
            &s;eem entirely lifele&s;s; they may be taken away, and even killed without
            their te&s;tifying any great pain; and tho&s;e who find them in this manner
            carry them home in order <PB N="45" REF="64"> to breed up the young and eat the
            old ones. A gradual and gentle warmth revives them; but they would die if too
            &s;uddenly brought near the fire, or if their juices were too quickly
            li|quefied.</P>
<P>Strictly &s;peaking, &s;ays Mr. Buffon, the&s;e ani|mals cannot be
            &s;aid to &s;leep during the winter; it may be called rather a torpor, a
            &s;tagnation of all the faculties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
                xvi. Loir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
            torpor is produced by the congelation of their blood, which is na|turally much
            colder than that of all other qua|drupedes. The u&s;ual heat of man and other
            animals is about thirty degrees above congela|tion; the heat of the&s;e is not
            above ten de|grees. Their internal heat is &s;eldom greater than that of the
            temperature of the air. This has been often tried by plunging the ball of the
            thermometer into the body of a living dormou&s;e, and it never ro&s;e beyond
            its u&s;ual pitch in air, and &s;ometimes it &s;unk above a degree. It is not
            &s;urprizing, therefore, that the&s;e animals, who&s;e blood is &s;o cold
            naturally, &s;hould become torpid, when the external cold is too powerful for
            the &s;mall quantity of heat in their bodies, yet remaining; and this always
            happens when the thermometer is not more than ten degrees <PB N="46" REF="65">
            above congelation. This coldne&s;s Mr. Buffon has experienced in the blood of
            the bat, the dormou&s;e, and the hedge-hog, and with great ju&s;tice he extends
            the analogy to the marmout, which like the re&s;t is &s;een to &s;leep all the
            winter. This torpid &s;tate continues as long as the cau&s;e which produces it
            continues; and it is very pro|bable that it might be lengthened out beyond its
            u&s;ual term, by artificially prolonging the cold; if, for in&s;tance, the
            animal were rolled up in wool, and placed in a cold cellar, nearly ap|proaching
            to, but not quite &s;o cold as an ice-hou&s;e, for that would kill them
            outright, it would remain perhaps a whole year in its &s;tate of
            in&s;en&s;ibility. However this be, if the heat of the air be above ten
            degrees, the&s;e animals are &s;een to revive; and, if it be continued in that
            degree of temperature, they do not become torpid, but eat and &s;leep at proper
            intervals like all other quadrupedes whatever.</P>
<P>From the above account we may form &s;ome conception of the
            &s;tate in which the&s;e animals continue during the winter. As in &s;ome
            di&s;|orders where the circulation is extremely lan|guid, the appetite is
            dimini&s;hed in proportion, &s;o in the&s;e the blood &s;carcely moving, or
            only moving in the greater ve&s;&s;els, they want no <PB N="47" REF="66">
            nouri&s;hment to repair what is worn away by its motions. They are &s;een,
            indeed, by &s;low de|grees to become leaner in proportion to the &s;low
            attrition of their fluids; but this is not perceptible except at the end of
            &s;ome months. Man is often known to gather nouri&s;hment from the ambient air;
            and the&s;e al&s;o may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be &s;upplied in the &s;ame manner;
            and, having &s;ufficient motion in their fluids to keep them from putrefaction,
            and ju&s;t &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment to &s;upply the wa&s;te of their lan|guid
            circulation, they continue rather feebly alive than &s;leeping.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals produce but once a year, and u&s;ually bring forth
            but three or four at a time. They grow very fa&s;t, and the extent of their
            lives is not above nine or ten years; &s;o that the &s;pecies is neither
            numerous nor very much dif|fu&s;ed. They are chiefly found in the Alps, where
            they &s;eem to prefer the brow of the highe&s;t mountains to the lowe&s;t
            ranges, and the &s;unny &s;ide to that in the &s;hade. The inhabi|tants of the
            country where they chiefly re&s;ide, when they ob&s;erve the hole, generally
            &s;tay till winter before they think proper to open it; for if they begin too
            &s;oon, the animal wakes, and, as it has a &s;urprizing faculty of digging, 
            <PB N="48" REF="67"> makes its hole deeper in proportion as they fol|low. Such
            as kill it for food, u&s;e every art to improve the fle&s;h, which is &s;aid to

            abundance, and &s;alt the remainder, drying it &s;omewhat in the manner of
            bacon. Still, how|ever, it is &s;aid to be very indifferent eating. This animal
            is found in Poland under the de|nomination of the Bobak, entirely re&s;embling

            the former. It is found al&s;o in Siberia under the name of the Jevra&s;ka,
            being rather &s;maller than either of the other two. La&s;tly, it is found in
            Canada by the appellation of the Monax, differing only from the re&s;t in
            having a bluei&s;h &s;nout and a longer tail.</P>

<HEAD>THE AGOUTI.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the marmout, which differs from the hare &s;o much in the

            particular de&s;cription. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, and that the large&s;t, as
            was hinted above, is called the Agouti. This animal is found in great abundance
            in the &s;outhern parts of Ame|rica, and has by &s;ome been called the rabbit
            of that continent. But, tho' in many re&s;pects it re|&s;embles the rabbit, yet
            &s;till in many more it dif|fers, and is, without all doubt, an animal
            pecu|liar to the new world only. The agouti is about the &s;ize of a rabbit,
            and has a head very much re|&s;embling it, except that the ears are very
            &s;hort in compari&s;on. It re&s;embles the rabbit al&s;o in the arched form of
            its back, in the hind legs being longer than the fore, and in having four great
            cutting teeth, two above and two below; but then it differs in the nature of
            its hair, which is not &s;oft and downy as in the rabbit, but hard and
            bri&s;tly like that of a &s;ucking pig, and of a reddi&s;h brown colour. It
            differs al&s;o in the tail, which is even &s;horter than in the rabbit, and
            entirely de&s;titute of hair. La&s;tly, it differs in the number of its toes,
            having but three on the hinder feet, whereas the rabbit has five. All the&s;e
            di&s;tinctions, however, do not countervail again&s;t its general form, which
            re&s;embles that of a rabbit, and mo&s;t travellers have called it by that
            name.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="72">As this animal differs in form, it differs
            &s;till more in habitudes and di&s;po&s;ition. As it has the hair of an hog,
            &s;o al&s;o it has its voraciou&s;|ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It eats indi&s;criminately of all
            things; and, when &s;atiated, hides the remainder, like the dog or the fox, for
            a future occa&s;ion. It takes a plea&s;ure in gnawing and &s;poiling every
            thing it comes near. When irritated, its hair &s;tands erect along the back,
            and, like the rabbit, it &s;trikes the ground violently with its hind feet. It
            does not dig an hole in the ground, but bur|rows in the hollows of trees. Its
            ordinary food con&s;i&s;ts of the roots of the country, potatoes and yams, and
            &s;uch fruits as fall from the trees in autumn. It u&s;es its fore-paws like
            the &s;quirrel, to carry its food to its mouth; and as its hind feet are longer
            than the fore, it runs very &s;wiftly upon plain ground or up a hill, but upon
            a de&s;cent it is in danger of falling. Its &s;ight is excellent, and its
            hearing equals that of any other animal; whenever it is whi&s;tled to it
            &s;tops to hearken. The fle&s;h of &s;uch as are fat and well fed is tolerable
            food, although it has a peculiar ta&s;te and is a little tough. The French
            dre&s;s it like a &s;ucking pig, as we learn from Mr. Buffon's account; but the
            Engli&s;h dre&s;s it with a pudding in its belly, like an <PB N="51" REF="73">
            hare. It is hunted by dogs; and whenever it is got into a &s;ugar ground, where
            the canes cover the place, it is ea&s;ily overtaken, for it is embarra&s;&s;ed
            every &s;tep it takes, &s;o that a man may ea&s;ily come up with it without any
            other a&s;&s;i&s;tance. When in the open country, it u&s;ually runs with great
            &s;wiftne&s;s before the dogs until it gains its retreat, within which it
            con|tinues to hide, and nothing but filling the hole with &s;moke can force it
            out. For this purpo&s;e the hunter burns faggots or &s;traw at the en|trance,
            and conducts the &s;moke in &s;uch a man|ner that it fills the whole cavity.
            While this is doing, the poor little animal &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of its danger,
            and begs for quarter with a mo&s;t plaintive cry, &s;eldom quitting its hole
            till the ut|mo&s;t extremity. At la&s;t, when half &s;uffocated, it i&s;&s;ues
            out, and tru&s;ts once more to its &s;peed for protection. When &s;till forced
            by the dogs, and incapable of making good a retreat, it turns upon the hunters,
            and with its hair bri&s;tling like an hog, and &s;tanding upon its hind feet,
            it defends it&s;elf very ob&s;tinately. Sometimes it bites the legs of tho&s;e
            that attempt to take it, and will take out the piece wherever it fixes its
            teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ray's Synop.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Its cry when di&s;turbed or provoked re&s;embles 
            <PB N="52" REF="74"> that of a &s;ucking pig. If taken young, it is ea&s;ily
            tamed, continues to play harmle&s;sly about the hou&s;e, and goes out and
            returns of its own accord. In a &s;avage &s;tate it u&s;ually continues in the
            woods, and the female generally chu&s;es the mo&s;t ob&s;cure parts to bring
            forth her young. She there prepares a bed of leaves and dry gra&s;s, and
            generally brings forth two at a time. She breeds twice or thrice a year, and
            carries her young from one place to another, as convenience requires, in the
            man|ner of a cat. She generally lodges them when three days old in the hollow
            of a tree, &s;uckling them but for a very &s;hort time, for they &s;oon come to
            perfection, and it &s;hould con&s;equently follow that they &s;oon grow

<P>THE Paca is an animal al&s;o of South America, very much

            rabbit, but with as little propriety. It is about the &s;ize of an hare, or
            rather larger, and in figure &s;omewhat like a &s;ucking pig, which it al&s;o
            re&s;embles in its grunting and its manner of eating. It is, however, mo&s;t
            like the agouti, although it differs in &s;everal particulars. <PB REF="75">

</FIGURE> <PB N="53" REF="76"> Like the agouti, it is covered
            rather with coar&s;e hair than a downy fur. But then it is beautifully marked
            along the &s;ides with &s;mall a&s;h coloured &s;pots, upon an amber coloured
            ground; whereas the agouti is pretty much of one reddi&s;h colour. The paca is
            rather more thick and corpulent than the agouti; its no&s;e is &s;horter, and
            its hind feet have five toes; whereas the agouti has but three. As to the
            re&s;t, this animal bears &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to a rabbit, the ears
            are naked of hair and &s;omewhat &s;harp, the lower jaw is &s;omewhat longer
            than the upper, the teeth, the &s;hape of the head and the &s;ize of it, are
            like to tho&s;e of a rabbit. It has a &s;hort tail likewi&s;e, though not
            tufted, and its hinder legs are longer than the fore. It al&s;o burrows in the
            ground like that animal, and from this &s;imili|tude alone travellers might
            have given it the name.</P>
<P>The paca does not make u&s;e of its fore-paws, like the &s;quirrel
            or the agouti, to carry its food to the mouth, but hunts for it on the ground,
            and roots like an hog. It is generally &s;een along the banks of rivers, and is
            only to be found in the moi&s;t and warm countries of South America. It is a
            very fat animal, and in this re&s;pect much preferable to the agouti, that is

            and is con&s;idered as a great delicacy. Like the former little animal, it
            defends it&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity, and is very &s;eldom taken alive. It
            is per&s;ecuted not only by man, but by every bea&s;t and bird of prey, who all
            watch its motions, and, if it ventures at any di&s;tance from its hole, are
            &s;ure to &s;eize it. But although the race of the&s;e little animals is thus
            con|tinually de&s;troyed, it finds &s;ome refuge in its hole, from the general
            combination; and breeds in &s;uch numbers, that the diminution is not
            perceptible.</P>
<P>To the&s;e animals may be added others, very &s;imilar both in
            form and di&s;po&s;ition; each known by its particular name in its native
            country, but which travellers have been contented to call rabbits or hares; of
            which we have but indi|&s;tinct notice. The Tapeti, or the Bra&s;ilian rabbit,
            is in &s;hape like our Engli&s;h ones, but is much le&s;s, being &s;aid to be
            not above twice the &s;ize of a dormou&s;e. It is reddi&s;h on the forehead,
            and a little whiti&s;h under the throat. It is remarkable for having no tail;
            but it has long ears and whi&s;kers, like our rabbits, and black eyes. It does
            not burrow, like ours; but lives at large, like the hare.</P>
<P>The Aperea is al&s;o called by &s;ome the Bra&s;i|lian 
            <PB N="55" REF="80"> rabbit, being an animal that &s;eems to par|take of the
            nature of a rabbit and a rat. The ears are like tho&s;e of a rat, being &s;hort
            and round; but the other parts are like tho&s;e of a rabbit, except that it has
            but three toes on the hinder legs, like the Agouti.</P>
<P>To the&s;e imperfect &s;ketches of animals little known, others
            le&s;s known might be added; for as Nature becomes more diminutive, her
            operations are le&s;s attentively regarded. I &s;hall only, therefore, add one
            animal more to this cla&s;s, and that very well known; I mean the Guinea pig;
            which Bri&s;&s;on places among tho&s;e of the rabbit kind; and as I do not know
            any other &s;et of animals with which it can be &s;o well compared, I will take
            leave to follow his example.</P>

<HEAD>THE GUINEA-PIG.</HEAD>
<P>THE Guinea-Pig is a native of the warmer climates; but has been
            &s;o long rendered do|me&s;tic, and &s;o widely diffu&s;ed, that it is now
            become common in every part of the world. There are few unacquainted with the
            figure of this little animal; in &s;ome places it is con&s;idered as the
            principal favourite; and is often found <PB N="56" REF="81"> even to di&s;place
            the lap-dog. It is le&s;s than a rabbit, and its legs are &s;horter; they are
            &s;carce &s;een, except when it moves; and the neck, al&s;o, is &s;o &s;hort,
            that the head &s;eems &s;tuck upon the &s;houlders. The ears are &s;hort, thin
            and tran&s;parent; the hair is like that of a &s;uck|ing pig, from whence it
            has taken the name; and it wants even the ve&s;tiges of a tail. In other
            re&s;pects, it has &s;ome &s;imilitude to the rabbit. When it moves, its body
            lengthens like that animal; and when it is at re&s;t, it ga|thers up in the
            &s;ame manner. Its no&s;e is form|ed with the rabbit lip, except that its
            no&s;trils are much farther a&s;under. Like all other ani|mals in a dome&s;tic
            &s;tate, its colours are different; &s;ome are white, &s;ome are red, and
            others both red and white. It differs from the rabbit in the number of its
            toes, having four toes on the feet before, and but three on tho&s;e behind. It
            &s;trokes its head with the fore feet like the rab|bit; and, like it, &s;its
            upon the hind feet; for which purpo&s;e there is a naked callous &s;kin on the
            back part of the legs and feet.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are of all others the mo&s;t helple&s;s and
            inoffen&s;ive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This hi&s;tory is partly taken from the 
              <BIBL>Amaenitates Ac|cademicae, vol. iv. p. 202.</BIBL></NOTE>.
            They are &s;carce po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage &s;ufficient to defend

            mou&s;e. Their only animo&s;ity is exerted again&s;t each other; for they will
            often fight very ob&s;tinately; and the &s;tronger is often known to de&s;troy
            the weaker. But again&s;t all other aggre&s;&s;ors, their only remedy is
            patience and non-re&s;i&s;tance. How, therefore, the&s;e animals, in a &s;avage
            &s;tate, could contrive to protect them&s;elves, I have not been able to learn;
            as they want &s;trength, &s;wiftne&s;s, and even the natural in&s;tinct &s;o
            common to almo&s;t every other creature.</P>
<P>As to their manner of living among us, they owe their lives
            entirely to our uncea&s;ing pro|tection. They mu&s;t be con&s;tantly attended,
            &s;hielded from the exce&s;&s;ive colds of the winter, and &s;ecured again&s;t
            all other dome&s;tic animals, which are apt to attack them, from every mo|tive,
            either of appetite, jealou&s;y, or experience of their pu&s;illanimous nature.
            Such indeed is their &s;tupidity, that they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be
            devoured by the cats, without re&s;i&s;tance; and, different from all other
            creatures, the fe|male &s;ees her young de&s;troyed without once attempting to
            protect them. Their u&s;ual food is bran, par&s;ley, or cabbage leaves; but
            there is &s;carce a vegetable cultivated in our gardens that they will not
            gladly devour. The carrot|top is a peculiar dainty; as al&s;o &s;allad; and 
            <PB N="58" REF="83"> tho&s;e who would pre&s;erve their healths, would do right
            to vary their food; for if they be con|tinued on a kind too &s;ucculent or too
            dry, the effects are quickly perceived upon their con&s;ti|tutions. When fed
            upon recent vegetables, they &s;eldom drink. But it often happens that,
            conducted by nature, they &s;eek dryer food, when the former di&s;agrees with
            them. They then gnaw cloaths, paper, or whatever of this kind they meet with;
            and, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, they are &s;een to drink like mo&s;t other
            animals, which they do by lapping. They are chiefly fond of new milk; but, in
            ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, are contented with water.</P>
<P>They move pretty much in the manner of rabbits, though not near
            &s;o &s;wiftly; and when confined in a room, &s;eldom cro&s;s the floor, but
            generally keep along the wall. The male u&s;u|ally drives the female on before
            him, for they never move a-brea&s;t together; but con&s;tantly the one &s;eems
            to tread in the foot&s;teps of the preceding. They chiefly &s;eek for the
            darke&s;t rece&s;&s;es, and the mo&s;t intricate retreats; where, if hay be
            &s;pread as a bed for them, they con|tinue to &s;leep together, and &s;eldom
            venture out but when they &s;uppo&s;e all interruption removed. On tho&s;e
            occa&s;ions they act as rabbits; they &s;wiftly move forward from their bed,
            &s;top at <PB N="59" REF="84"> the entrance, li&s;ten, look round, and, if they
            perceive the &s;lighte&s;t approach of danger, they run back with
            precipitation. In very cold weather, however, they are more active, and run
            about in order to keep them&s;elves warm.</P>
<P>They are a very cleanly animal, and very different from that
            who&s;e name they go by. If the young ones happen to fall into the dirt, or be
            any other way di&s;compo&s;ed, the female takes &s;uch an aver&s;ion to them
            that &s;he never permits them to vi&s;it her more. Indeed, her whole
            employment, as well as that of the male, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in &s;moothing
            their &s;kins, in di&s;po&s;ing their hair, and improving its glo&s;s. The male
            and female take this office by turns; and when they have thus bru&s;hed up each
            other, they then be&s;tow all their concern upon their young, taking particular
            care to make their hair lie &s;mooth, and biting them if they appear
            refrac|tory. As they are &s;o &s;olicitous for elegance them&s;elves, the place
            where they are kept, mu&s;t be regularly cleaned, and a new bed of hay provided
            for them at lea&s;t every week. Being natives of a warm climate, they are
            naturally chilly in ours: cleanline&s;s, therefore, a&s;&s;i&s;ts warmth, and
            expels moi&s;ture. They may be thus reared, without the aid of any ar|tificial
            heat; but, in general, there is no keep|ing <PB N="60" REF="85"> them from the
            fire in winter, if they be once permitted to approach it.</P>
<P>When they go to &s;leep, they lie flat on their bellies, pretty
            much in their u&s;ual po&s;ture; ex|cept that they love to have their fore feet
            higher than their hinder. For this purpo&s;e, they turn them&s;elves &s;everal
            times round before they lie down, to find the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituation.
            They &s;leep, like the hare, with their eyes half open; and continue extremely
            watchful, if they &s;u&s;pect danger. The male and female are never &s;een both
            a&s;leep at the &s;ame time; but while he enjoys his repo&s;e, &s;he remains
            upon the watch, &s;ilently continuing to guard him, and her head turned towards
            the place where he lies. When &s;he &s;uppo&s;es that he has had his turn,
            &s;he then awakes him with a kind of murmuring noi&s;e, goes to him, forces him
            from his bed, and lies down in his place. He then performs the &s;ame good turn
            for her; and continues watchful till &s;he al&s;o has done &s;leeping.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are exceedingly &s;alacious, and generally are
            capable of coupling at &s;ix weeks old. The female never goes with young above
            five weeks; and u&s;ually brings forth from three to five at a time; and this
            not without pain. But what is very extraordinary, the fe|male 
            <PB N="61" REF="86"> admits the male the very day &s;he has brought forth, and
            becomes again pregnant; &s;o that their multiplication is a&s;toni&s;hing. She
            &s;uckles her young but about twelve or fifteen days; and during that time does
            not &s;eem to know her own; for if the young of any other be brought, though
            much older, &s;he never drives them away, but &s;uffers them even to drain her,
            to the di&s;advantage of her own im|mediate offspring. They are produced with
            the eyes open, like all others of the hare kind; and in about twelve hours,
            equal even to the dam in agility. Although the dam has but two teats, yet &s;he
            abundantly &s;upplies them with milk: and they are al&s;o capable of feeding
            upon vegetables, almo&s;t from the very begin|ning. If the young ones are
            permitted to con|tinue together, the &s;tronger, as in all other &s;ocieties,
            &s;oon begins to govern the weak. Their contentions are often long and
            ob&s;tinate; and their jealou&s;ies very apparent. Their di&s;|putes are
            u&s;ually for the warme&s;t place, or the mo&s;t agreeable food. If one of them
            happens to be more fortunate in this re&s;pect than the re&s;t, the
            &s;tronge&s;t generally comes to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s it of its advantageous
            &s;ituation. Their manner of fighting, though terrible to them, is ridiculous
            enough to a &s;pectator. One of them &s;eizes the <PB N="62" REF="87"> hair on
            the nape of the other's neck with its fore teeth, and attempts to tear it away;
            the other, to retaliate, turns its hinder parts to the enemy, and kicks up
            behind like an hor&s;e, and with its hinder claws &s;cratches the &s;ides of
            its adver&s;ary; &s;o that &s;ometimes they cover each other with blood. When
            they contend in this manner, they gna&s;h their teeth pretty loudly; and this
            is often a denunciation of mu|tual re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The&s;e, though &s;o formidable to each other, yet are the mo&s;t
            timorous creatures upon earth, with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of animated nature:
            a falling leaf di&s;turbs them, and every animal over|comes them. From hence
            they are difficultly tamed; and will &s;uffer none to approach them, except the
            per&s;on by whom they are fed. Their manner of eating is &s;omething like that
            of the rabbit; and, like it, they appear al&s;o to chew the cud. Although they
            &s;eldom drink, they make water every minute. They grunt &s;ome|what like a
            young pig; and have a more pierc|ing note to expre&s;s pain. In a word, they do
            no injury; but then, except the plea&s;ure they afford the &s;pectator, they
            are of very little be|nefit to mankind. Some, indeed, dre&s;s and eat them; but
            their fle&s;h is indifferent food, and by no means a reward for the trouble of
            rear|ing <PB REF="88">

            This, perhaps, might be improved, by keeping them in a proper warren, and not
            &s;uffering them to become dome&s;tic: however, the advantages that would

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Animals of the Rat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h animals of the rat kind
          from all others, we might de&s;cribe them as having two large cutting teeth,
          like the hare kind, in each jaw; as co|vered with hair; and as not ruminating.
          The&s;e di&s;tinctions might &s;erve to guide us, had we not too near an
          acquaintance with this noxious race to be mi&s;taken in their kind. Their
          numbers, their minutene&s;s, their vicinity, their va&s;t mul|tiplication, all
          &s;ufficiently contribute to pre&s;s them upon our ob&s;ervation, and remind us
          of their exi&s;tence. Indeed, if we look through the different ranks of
          animals, from the large&s;t to the &s;malle&s;t, from the great elephant to the
          diminutive mou&s;e, we &s;hall find that we &s;uffer greater injuries from the
          contemptible mean|ne&s;s of the one, than the formidable inva&s;ions of the
          other. Again&s;t the elephant, the rhi|noceros, or the lion, we can oppo&s;e
          united &s;trength; and by art make up the deficiencies of natural power:
          the&s;e we have driven into their native &s;olitudes, and obliged to continue
          at a di&s;tance, in the mo&s;t inconvenient regions and unhealthful climates.
          But it is otherwi&s;e <PB N="65" REF="93"> with the little teizing race I am
          now de&s;cribing: no force can be exerted again&s;t their unre&s;i&s;t|ing
          timidity; no arts can dimini&s;h their amaz|ing propagation: millions may be at
          once de|&s;troyed, and yet the breach be repaired in the &s;pace of a very few
          weeks; and, in proportion as Nature has denied them force, it has &s;up|plied
          the defect by their fecundity.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, the animal be&s;t known at pre&s;ent, and in every
          re&s;pect the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous, is the Great Rat; which, though but a new
          comer into this country, has taken too &s;ecure a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to be ever
          removed. This hateful and rapacious creature, though &s;ometimes called the Rat
          of Norway, is utterly unknown in all the northern countries, and, by the be&s;t
          accounts I can learn, comes originally from the Levant. Its fir&s;t arrival, as
          I am a&s;&s;ured, was upon the coa&s;ts of Ireland, in tho&s;e &s;hips that
          traded in provi&s;ions to Gibraltar; and perhaps we owe to a &s;ingle pair of
          the&s;e animals, the numerous progeny that now infe&s;ts the whole extent of
          the Briti&s;h Empire.</P>
<P>This animal, which is called by Mr. Buffon the Surmalot, is in
          length about nine inches; its eyes are large and black; the colour of the head,
          and the whole upper part of the body, is of a light brown, mixed with tawny and
          a&s;h colour. The <PB N="66" REF="94"> end of the no&s;e, the throat and belly,
          are of a dirty white, inclining to a grey; the feet and legs are almo&s;t bare,
          and of a dirty pale fle&s;h colour; the tail is as long as the body, covered
          with minute du&s;ky &s;cales, mixed with a few hairs, and adds to the general
          deformity of its dete&s;table figure. It is chiefly in the colour that this
          animal differs from the Black Rat, or the Common Rat, as it was once called;
          but now common no longer. This new invader, in a very few years after its
          arrival, found means to de&s;troy almo&s;t the whole &s;pecies, and to
          po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf of their retreats.</P>
<P>But it was not again&s;t the Black Rat alone that its rapacity was
          directed; all other animals of inferior &s;trength &s;hared the &s;ame
          misfortunes. The conte&s;t with the black rat was of &s;hort continuance. As it
          was unable to contend, and had no holes to fly to for retreat, but where its
          voracious enemy could pur&s;ue, the whole race was &s;oon extingui&s;hed. The
          Frog al&s;o was an animal equally incapable of combat or defence. It had been
          de&s;ignedly introduced into the kingdom of Ireland &s;ome years before the
          Norway rat; and it was &s;een to multiply amazingly. The inhabitants were
          plea&s;ed with the propagation of an harmle&s;s animal, that &s;erved to rid
          their fields of in&s;ects; and even <PB N="67" REF="95"> the prejudices of the
          people were in its fa|vour, as they &s;uppo&s;ed that the frog contributed to
          render their waters more whole&s;ome. But the Norway rat &s;oon put a &s;top to
          their encrea&s;e; as the&s;e animals were of an amphibious nature, they
          pur&s;ued the frog to its lakes and took it even in its own natural element. I
          am, there|fore, a&s;&s;ured, that the frog is once more almo&s;t extinct in
          that kingdom; and that the Norway rat, having no more enemies left there to
          de&s;troy, is grown le&s;s numerous al&s;o.</P>
<P>We are not likely, therefore, to gain by the de&s;truction of our
          old dome&s;tics, &s;ince they are replaced by &s;uch mi&s;chievous
          &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The Norway rat has the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to injure us,
          with much greater power of mi&s;chief. It burrows in the banks of rivers,
          ponds, and ditches; and is every year known to do incre|dible damage to tho&s;e
          mounds that are rai&s;ed to conduct &s;treams, or to prevent rivers from
          overflowing. In the&s;e holes, which it forms pretty near the edge of the
          water, it chiefly re&s;ides during the &s;ummer, where it lives upon &s;mall
          animals, fi&s;h, and corn. At the ap|proach of winter, it comes nearer the farm
          hou&s;es; burrows in their corn, eats much, and damages &s;till more than it
          con&s;umes. But no|thing that can be eaten, &s;eems to e&s;cape its 
          <PB N="68" REF="96"> voracity. It de&s;troys rabbits, poultry, and all kinds of
          game; and, like the polecat, kills much more than it can carry away. It &s;wims
          with great ea&s;e, dives with great celerity, and ea&s;ily thins the fi&s;h
          pond. In &s;hort, &s;carce any of the feebler animals e&s;cape its rapacity,
          ex|cept the mou&s;e, which &s;helters it&s;elf in its little hole, where the
          Norway rat is too big to follow.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals frequently produce from fif|teen to thirty at a
          time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xvii. p. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>; and
          u&s;ually bring forth three times a year. This great encrea&s;e would quickly
          be found to overrun the whole country, and render our a&s;&s;iduity to
          de&s;troy them fruitle&s;s, were it not, happily for us, that they eat and
          de&s;troy each other. The &s;ame in&s;atiable appetite that impels them to
          indi&s;criminate carnage, al&s;o incites the &s;tronge&s;t to devour the
          weake&s;t, even of their own kind. The large male rat generally keeps in an
          hole by it&s;elf, and is as dreaded by its own &s;pecies, as the mo&s;t
          formidable enemies. In this man|ner the number of the&s;e vermin is kept within
          due bounds; and when their encrea&s;e becomes injurious to us, it is
          repre&s;&s;ed by their own ra|pacity.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="97">But be&s;ide their own enmities among each
          other, all the &s;tronger carnivorous quadrupedes have natural antipathies
          again&s;t them. The dog, though he dete&s;ts their fle&s;h, yet openly declares
          his alacrity to pur&s;ue them; and attacks them with great animo&s;ity. Such as
          are trained up to killing the&s;e vermin, di&s;patch them often with a &s;ingle
          &s;queeze: but tho&s;e dogs that &s;hew any he&s;itation, are &s;ure to come
          off but indif|ferently; for the rat always takes the advantage of a moment's
          delay, and, in&s;tead of waiting for the attack, becomes the aggre&s;&s;or,
          &s;eizing its pur&s;uer by the lip, and inflicting a very painful and dangerous
          wound. From the in|flammation, and other angry &s;ymptoms that attend this
          animal's bite, &s;ome have been led to think that it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure
          venemous; but it is likely that the difficulty of the wound's healing, ari&s;es
          merely from its being deep and lacerated by the teeth, and is rather a
          con|&s;equence of the figure of the in&s;truments that inflict it, than any
          venom they may be &s;up|po&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The cat is another formidable enemy of this kind; and yet the
          generality of our cats neither care to attack it, nor to feed upon it when
          killed. The cat is a more prudent hunter than the dog, and will not be at the
          pains to take <PB N="70" REF="98"> or combat with an enemy that is not likely
          to repay her time and danger. Some cats, however, will pur&s;ue and take the
          rat; though often not without an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. If hungry al&s;o,
          the cat will &s;ometimes eat the head; but, in general, &s;he is merely content
          with her victory.</P>
<P>A foe much more dangerous to the&s;e vermin is the wea&s;el. This
          animal pur&s;ues them with avidity; and being pretty nearly of their own
          &s;ize, follows them into their holes, where a de&s;perate combat en&s;ues. The
          &s;trength of each is pretty near equal; but the arms are very different. The
          rat, furni&s;hed with four long tu&s;ks at the extremity of its jaw, rather
          &s;naps than bites; but the wea&s;el, where it once fa&s;tens, holds, and
          continuing al&s;o to &s;uck the blood at the &s;ame time, weakens its
          antagoni&s;t, and always obtains the victory. Mankind have contrived &s;everal
          other methods of de&s;troying the&s;e noxious intruders; ferrets, traps, and
          par|ticularly poi&s;on: but of all other poi&s;ons, I am told that the nux
          vomica, ground and mixed with meal, is the mo&s;t certain, as it is the lea&s;t
          dangerous.</P>
<P>To this &s;pecies I will &s;ubjoin as a variety, the Black Rat,
          mentioned above, greatly re&s;em|bling the former in figure, but very
          di&s;tinct in <PB N="71" REF="99"> nature, as appears from their mutual
          antipathy. This animal was formerly as mi&s;chievous as it was common; but at
          pre&s;ent it is almo&s;t ut|terly extirpated by the great rat, one malady often
          expelling another. It is become &s;o &s;carce, that I do not remember ever to
          have &s;een one. It is &s;aid to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the voracious and
          unnatural appetites of the former; though, as it is le&s;s, they may probably
          be le&s;s noxious. Its length is about &s;even inches; and the tail is near
          eight inches long. The colour of the body is of a deep iron grey, bordering
          upon black, except the belly, which is of a dirty cinereous hue. They have
          propagated in America in great numbers, being originally introduced from
          Europe; and as they &s;eem to keep their ground wherever they get footing, they
          are now become the mo&s;t noxious animals in that part of the world.</P>
<P>To this al&s;o we may &s;ubjoin the Black Water Rat, about the
          &s;ame &s;ize with the latter, with a larger head, a blunter no&s;e, le&s;s
          eyes, and &s;horter ears, and the tip of its tail a little white. It was
          &s;uppo&s;ed by Ray to be web footed; but this has been found to be a
          mi&s;take, its toes pretty much re&s;embling tho&s;e of its kind. It never
          frequents hou&s;es; but is u&s;ually found on the banks of rivers, ditches and
          ponds, where <PB N="72" REF="100"> it burrows and breeds. It feeds on fi&s;h,
          frogs, and in&s;ects; and in &s;ome countries it is eat on fa&s;ting days.</P>

<HEAD>THE MOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal equally mi&s;chievous, and equally well known with the
            former, is the mou&s;e. Ti|mid, cautious and active, all its di&s;po&s;itions
            are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the rat, except with fewer powers of doing

            attends upon mankind, and comes an unbidden gue&s;t to his mo&s;t delicate

            never leaves its hole but to &s;eek provi&s;ion, and &s;eldom ventures above a
            few paces from home. Dif|ferent from the rat, it does not go from one hou&s;e
            to another, unle&s;s it be forced; and, as it is more ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, it

<P>Almo&s;t all animals are tamed more difficultly in proportion to

            familiar, but tho&s;e that are always fearful are ever &s;u&s;picious. The

            quadrupedes, except the guinea-pig, is never <PB N="73" REF="101"> rendered
            thoroughly familiar; and, even though fed in a cage, retains its natural

            fortnight are &s;trong enough to run about and &s;hift for them&s;elves. They
            are chiefly found in farmers yards and among their corn, but are &s;eldom in
            tho&s;e ricks that are much infe&s;ted with rats. They generally chu&s;e the
            &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the rick, from whence mo&s;t rain is expected; and
            from thence they often, of an evening, venture &s;orth to drink the little

            Ari&s;totle gives us an idea of their prodigious fecundity, by a&s;&s;uring us
            that, having put a mou&s;e with young into a ve&s;&s;el of corn, in &s;ome time

            <PB N="74" REF="102"> of its life, which &s;eldom la&s;ts above two or three
            years. This &s;pecies is very much dif|fu&s;ed, being found in almo&s;t all
            parts of the ancient continent, and having been exported to the new<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Li&s;le's Hu&s;bandry, vol. ii. p. 391.</BIBL></NOTE>. They
            are animals that, while they fear human &s;ociety, clo&s;ely attend it; and,
            al|though enemies to man, are never found but near tho&s;e places where he has
            fixed his habita|tion. Numberle&s;s ways have been found for de&s;troying them;
            and Ge&s;ner has minutely de|&s;cribed the variety of traps by which they are
            taken. Our Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures propo&s;ed a
            reward for the mo&s;t ingenious contrivance for that pur|po&s;e; and I
            ob&s;erved almo&s;t every candidate pa&s;&s;ing off de&s;criptions as
            inventions of his own. I thought it was cruel to detect the pla|giari&s;m, or
            fru&s;trate the humble ambition of tho&s;e who would be thought the inventors
            of a mou&s;e-trap.</P>
<P>To this &s;pecies, merely to avoid teizing the reader with a
            minute de&s;cription of animals very incon&s;iderable and very nearly alike, I
            will add that of the <HI>long tail'd field mou&s;e,</HI> which is larger than
            the former, of a colour very nearly re&s;embling the Norway rat, and chiefly
            found in fields and gardens. They are extremely vo|racious, and hurtful in
            gardens and young nur|&s;eries, <PB N="75" REF="103"> where they are killed in
            great numbers. However, their fecundity quickly repairs the de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Nearly re&s;embling the former, but larger, (for it is &s;ix
            inches long) is the <HI>&s;hort tailed field mou&s;e</HI>; which, as its name
            implies, has the tail much &s;horter than the former, it being not above an
            inch and an half long, and ending in a &s;mall tuft. Its colour is more
            inclining to that of the dome&s;tic mou&s;e, the upper part being blacki&s;h
            and the under of an a&s;h colour. This, as well as the former, are remarkable
            for laying up provi&s;ion again&s;t winter; and Mr. Buffon a&s;&s;ures us they
            &s;ometimes have a &s;tore of above a bu&s;hel at a time.</P>
<P>We may add al&s;o the <HI>&s;hrew mou&s;e</HI> to this &s;pecies
            of minute animals, being about the &s;ize of the dome&s;tic mou&s;e, but
            differing greatly from it in the form of its no&s;e, which is very long and
            &s;lender. The teeth al&s;o are of a very &s;ingular form, and twenty-eight in
            number; whereas the common number in the rat kind is u&s;ually not above
            &s;ixteen. The two upper fore teeth are very &s;harp, and on each &s;ide of
            them there is a kind of wing or beard, like that of an arrow, &s;carce
            vi&s;ible but on a clo&s;e in|&s;pection. The other teeth are placed clo&s;e
            to|gether, being very &s;mall, and &s;eeming &s;carce <PB N="76" REF="104">
            &s;eparated; &s;o that with re&s;pect to this part of its formation, the animal
            has &s;ome re&s;emblance to the viper. However, it is a very harmle&s;s little
            creature, doing &s;carce any injury. On the contrary, as it lives chiefly in
            the fields, and feeds more upon in&s;ects than corn, it may be con&s;idered
            rather as a friend than an enemy. It has a &s;trong di&s;agreeable &s;mell,
            &s;o that the cat, when it is killed, will refu&s;e to eat it. It is &s;aid to
            bring four or five young at a time.</P>

<HEAD>THE DORMOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE animals may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three kinds; the
            <HI>greater dormou&s;e,</HI> which Mr. Buffon calls the Loir; the
            <HI>middle,</HI> which he calls the Lerot; the <HI>le&s;s,</HI> which he
            denomi|nates the Mu&s;cardin. They differ from each other in &s;ize, the
            large&s;t being equal to a rat, the lea&s;t being no bigger than a mou&s;e.
            They all differ from the rat in having the tail tufted with hair, in the manner
            of a &s;quirrel, except that the &s;quirrel's tail is flat, re&s;embling a fan;
            and theirs round, re&s;embling a bru&s;h. The lerot differs from the loir by
            having two black &s;pots near the eyes; the mu&s;cardin differs from both in
            the whiti&s;h colour of its hair on <PB N="77" REF="105"> the back. They all
            three agree in having black &s;parkling eyes, and the whi&s;kers partly white
            and partly black. They agree in their being &s;tupefied like the marmout during
            the winter, and in their hoarding up provi&s;ions to &s;erve them in ca&s;e of
            a temporary revival.</P>
<P>They inhabit woods or very thick hedges, forming their ne&s;ts in
            the hollow of &s;ome tree, or near the bottom of a clo&s;e &s;hrub, humbly
            content with continuing at the bottom, and never a&s;piring to &s;port among
            the branches. Towards the approach of the cold &s;ea&s;on they form a little
            magazine of nuts, beans, or acorns; and, having laid in their hoard, &s;hut
            them&s;elves up with it for the winter. As &s;oon as they feel the fir&s;t
            advances of the cold they prepare to le&s;&s;en its effect, by rolling
            them&s;elves up in a ball, and thus expo&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t &s;urface to
            the weather. But it often happens that the warmth of a &s;unny day, or an
            accidental change from cold to heat, thaws their nearly &s;tagnant fluids, and
            they revive. On &s;uch occa&s;ions they have their provi&s;ions laid in, and
            they have not far to &s;eek for their &s;upport. In this manner they continue
            u&s;ually a&s;leep, but &s;ome|times waking, for above five months in the year,
            &s;eldom venturing from their retreats, and con&s;equently but rarely &s;een.
            Their ne&s;ts are <PB N="78" REF="106"> lined with mo&s;s gra&s;s and dead
            leaves; they u&s;ually bring forth three or four young at a time, and that but

<HEAD>THE MUSK RAT.</HEAD>
<P>OF the&s;e animals of the rat kind, but with a mu&s;ky &s;mell,
            there are al&s;o three di&s;tinctions, as of the former; the Ondatra, the
            De&s;man, and the Pilori. The Ondatra is a native of Ca|nada, the De&s;man of
            Lapland, and the Pilori of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. The ondatra differs from
            all others of its kind, in having the tail flatted and carried edge-ways. The
            de&s;man has a long extended &s;nout like the &s;hrew mou&s;e; and the pilori a
            &s;hort tail, as thick at one end as the other. They all re&s;emble each other
            in being fond of the water, but particularly in that mu&s;ky odour from whence
            they have taken their name.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, the Ondatra is the mo&s;t remarkable, and has been the
            mo&s;t minutely de&s;cribed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xx. p.
                4.</BIBL></NOTE>. This animal is about the &s;ize of a &s;mall rabbit, but has
            the hair, the colour, and the tail of a rat, except that it is flatted on the
            &s;ides, as mentioned above. But it is &s;till more extraordi|nary upon other
            accounts, and different from all other animals whatever. It is &s;o formed that
            it can <PB N="79" REF="107"> contract and enlarge its body at plea&s;ure. It
            has a mu&s;cle like that of hor&s;es, by which they move, their hides lying
            immediately under the &s;kin, and that furni&s;hed with &s;uch a power of
            con|traction, together with &s;uch an ela&s;ticity in the fal&s;e ribs, that
            this animal can creep into an hole where others, &s;eemingly much le&s;s,
            cannot follow. The female is remarkable al&s;o for two di&s;tinct apertures,
            one for urine, the other for propagation. The male is equally ob&s;ervable for
            a peculiarity of conformation; the mu&s;ky &s;mell is much &s;tronger at one
            particular &s;ea&s;on of the year than any other; and the marks of the &s;ex
            &s;eem to appear and di&s;appear in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The ondatra in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles the beaver in its
            nature and di&s;po&s;ition. They both live in &s;ociety during winter; they
            both form hou&s;es of two feet and an half wide, in which they re&s;ide
            &s;everal families together. In the&s;e they do not a&s;&s;emble to &s;leep as
            the marmout, but purely to &s;helter them&s;elves from the rigour of the
            &s;ea&s;on. However, they do not lay up magazines of provi&s;ion like the
            beaver; they only form a kind of covert way to and round their dwelling, from
            whence they i&s;&s;ue to procure water and roots, upon which they
            &s;ub&s;i&s;t. During winter their hou&s;es are covered under a depth of eight 
            <PB N="80" REF="108"> or ten feet of &s;now; &s;o that they mu&s;t lead but a
            cold, gloomy and a nece&s;&s;itous life, during its continuance. During
            &s;ummer they &s;eparate two by two, and feed upon the variety of roots and
            vegetables that the &s;ea&s;on offers. They then become extremely fat, and are
            much &s;ought after, as well for their fle&s;h as their &s;kins, which are very
            valuable. They then al&s;o acquire a very &s;trong &s;cent of mu&s;k, &s;o
            plea&s;ing to an Eu|ropean, but which the &s;avages of Canada cannot abide.
            What we admire as a perfume they con&s;ider as a mo&s;t abominable &s;tench,
            and call one of their rivers, on the banks of which this animal is &s;een to
            burrow in numbers, by the name of the &s;tinking river, as well as the rat
            it&s;elf, which is denominated by them the &s;tinkard. This is a &s;trange
            diver&s;ity among mankind; and, perhaps, may be a&s;cribed to the different
            kinds of food among different nations. Such as chiefly feed upon rancid oils
            and putrid fle&s;h will often mi&s;take the nature of &s;cents; and, having
            been long u&s;ed to ill &s;mells, will by habit con&s;ider them as perfumes. Be
            this as it will, although the&s;e nations of northern &s;avages con&s;ider the
            mu&s;k rat as intolerably foetid, they neverthele&s;s regard it as very good
            eating; and, indeed, in this they imitate the epicures of Europe very exactly,
            who&s;e ta&s;te &s;eldom reli&s;hes a di&s;h till <PB N="81" REF="109"> the
            no&s;e gives the &s;tronge&s;t marks of di&s;appro|bation. As to the re&s;t,
            this animal a good deal re&s;embles the beaver in its habits and
            di&s;po|&s;ition; but, as its in&s;tincts are le&s;s powerful, and its oeconomy
            le&s;s exact, I will re&s;erve for the de&s;cription of that animal a part of
            what may be applicable to this.</P>

<HEAD>THE CRICETUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cricetus, or German Rat, which Mr. Buffon calls the Ham&s;ter,
            greatly re&s;embles the water-rat in its &s;ize, &s;mall eyes, and the
            &s;hort|ne&s;s of its tail. It differs in colour, being rather browner, like
            the Norway rat, with the belly and legs of a dirty yellow. But the marks by
            which it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others are two pouches, like tho&s;e
            of a baboon, on each &s;ide of its jaw, under the &s;kin, into which it can
            cram a large quantity of provi&s;ion. The&s;e bags are oblong, and of the
            &s;ize, when filled, of a large walnut. They open into the mouth, and fall back
            along the neck to the &s;houlder. Into the&s;e the animal can thru&s;t the
            &s;urplus of tho&s;e fruits or grains it gathers in the fields, &s;uch as
            wheat, peas, or acorns. When the immediate calls of hunger are &s;atisfied, it
            then falls to filling the&s;e; and thus, loaded with two great bunches on each
            &s;ide of the jaw, it <PB N="82" REF="110"> returns home to its hole to
            depo&s;it the &s;poil as a &s;tore for the winter. The &s;ize, the fecundity,
            and the voraciou&s;ne&s;s of this animal render it one of the greate&s;t
            pe&s;ts in the countries where it is found, and every method is made u&s;e of
            to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>But, although this animal is very noxious with re&s;pect to man,
            yet, con&s;idered with re|gard to tho&s;e in&s;tincts which conduce to its own
            &s;upport and convenience, it de&s;erves our ad|miration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvi. p. 159.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its hole offers a
            very curious object for contemplation, and &s;hews a degree of &s;kill
            &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the rat kind. It con&s;i&s;ts of a variety of
            apartments, fitted up for the different occa&s;ions of the little inhabitant.
            It is generally made on an inclining ground, and always has two entrances, one
            perpendicular and the other oblique; though, if there be more than one in a
            family, there are as many perpen|dicular holes as there are individuals below.
            The perpendicular hole is u&s;ually that through which they go in and out; the
            oblique &s;erves to give a thorough air to keep the retreat clean, and, in
            ca&s;e one hole is &s;topped, to give an exit at this. Within about a foot of
            the perpendicular hole the animal makes two more, where are depo&s;ited the
            family's provi&s;ions. The&s;e are <PB N="83" REF="111"> The&s;e are much more
            &s;pacious than the former, and are large in proportion to the quantity of the
            &s;tore. Be&s;ide the&s;e, there is &s;till another apartment warmly lined with
            gra&s;s and &s;traw, where the female brings forth her young; all the&s;e
            communicate with each other, and all to|gether take up a &s;pace of ten or
            twelve feet in diameter. The&s;e animals furni&s;h their &s;tore-hou&s;es with
            dry corn well cleaned; they al&s;o lay in corn in the ear, and beans and peas
            in the pod. The&s;e, when occa&s;ion requires, they afterwards &s;eparate,
            carrying out the pods and empty ears by their oblique pa&s;&s;age. They
            u&s;ually begin to lay in at the latter end of Au|gu&s;t; and, as each magazine
            is filled, they carefully cover up the mouth with earth, and that &s;o neatly
            that it is no ea&s;y matter to di&s;cover where the earth has been removed. The
            only means of finding out their retreats are, there|fore, to ob&s;erve the
            oblique entrance, which generally has a &s;mall quantity of earth before it;
            and this, though often &s;everal yards from their perpendicular retreat, leads
            tho&s;e who are &s;killed in the &s;earch to make the di&s;covery. Many German
            pea&s;ants are known to make a livelihood by finding out and bringing off their
            <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oards, which, in a fruitful
            &s;ea&s;on, often furni&s;h two bu&s;hels of good grain in each apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="112">Like mo&s;t others of the rat kind, they
            pro|duce twice or thrice a year, and bring five or &s;ix at a time. Some years
            they appear in alarm|ing numbers, at other times they are not &s;o plenty. The
            moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons a&s;&s;i&s;t their propa|gation; and it often happens on
            &s;uch years that their deva&s;tations produce a famine all over the country.
            Happily, however, for mankind, the&s;e, like the re&s;t of their kind,
            de&s;troy each other; and of two that Mr. Buffon kept in a cage, male and
            female, the latter killed and devoured the former. As to the re&s;t, their fur
            is con&s;idered as very valuable; the natives are invited by rewards to
            de&s;troy them; and the wea&s;el kind &s;econds the wi&s;hes of government with
            great &s;ucce&s;s. Although they are u&s;ually found brown on the back and
            white on the belly, yet many of them are ob&s;erved to be grey, which may
            probably ari&s;e from the difference of age.</P>

<HEAD>THE LEMING.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered various kinds of the&s;e noxious little
            animals that elude the indignation of mankind, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by their
            number, not their &s;trength, we come to a &s;pecies more bold, more dangerous,
            and more numerous than any of the former. The Leming, which is a native 
            <PB N="85" REF="113"> of Scandinavia, is often &s;een to pour down in myriads
            from the northern mountains, and, like a pe&s;tilence, de&s;troy all the
            productions of the earth. It is de&s;cribed as being larger than a dormou&s;e,
            with a bu&s;hy tail, though &s;horter. It is covered with thin hair of various
            colours. The extremity of the upper part of the head is black, as are
            likewi&s;e the neck and &s;houlders, but the re&s;t of the body is reddi&s;h,
            intermixed with &s;mall black &s;pots of various figures, as far as the tail,
            which is not above half an inch long. The eyes are little and black, the ears
            round and inclining towards the back, the legs before are &s;hort, and tho&s;e
            behind longer, which gives it a great degree of &s;wiftne&s;s. But what it is
            much more remarkable for than its figure are, its amazing fecundity and
            extraordinary mi|grations.</P>
<P>In wet &s;ea&s;ons, all of the rat kind are known to propagate
            more than in the dry; but this &s;pecies in particular is &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted
            in multiplying by the moi&s;ture of the weather, that the inhabitants of
            Lapland &s;incerely believe that they drop from the clouds, and that the &s;ame
            magazines that furni&s;h hail and &s;now pour the leming al&s;o upon them. In
            fact, after long rain, the&s;e animals &s;et forward from their native
            mountains, and &s;everal millions in a troop deluge the whole 
            <PB N="86" REF="114"> plain with their numbers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p. 872.</BIBL></NOTE>. They move,
            for the mo&s;t part, in a &s;quare, marching forward by night and lying &s;till
            by day. Thus, like an animated torrent, they are often &s;een more than a mile
            broad covering the ground, and that &s;o thick that the hindmo&s;t touches its
            leader. It is in vain that the poor inhabitant re&s;i&s;ts or at|tempts to
            &s;top their progre&s;s, they &s;till keep moving forward; and, though
            thou&s;ands are de&s;troyed, myriads are &s;een to &s;ucceed and make their
            de&s;truction impracticable. They generally move in lines, which are about
            three feet from each other and exactly parallel. Their march is always directed
            from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and regularly conducted from the
            beginning. Wherever their motions are turned nothing can &s;top them; they go
            directly forward, impelled by &s;ome &s;trange power; and, from the time they
            fir&s;t &s;et out, they never once think of retreating. If a lake or a river
            happens to interrupt their progre&s;s, they all together take the water and
            &s;wim over it; a fire, a deep well, or a torrent, does not turn them out of
            their &s;traight lined direction; they boldly plunge into the flames, or leap
            down the well, and are &s;ome|times &s;een climbing up on the other &s;ide. If
            they are interrupted by a boat acro&s;s a river <PB N="87" REF="115"> while
            they are &s;wimming, they never attempt to &s;wim round it, but mount directly
            up its &s;ides; and the boat-men, who know how vain re&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch a
            ca&s;e would be, calmly &s;uffer the living torrent to pa&s;s over, which it
            does without further damage. If they meet with a &s;tack of hay or corn that
            interrupts their pa&s;&s;age, in&s;tead of going over it they gnaw their way
            through; if they are &s;topped by a hou&s;e in their cour&s;e, if they cannot
            get through it, they con|tinue there till they die. It is happy, however, for
            mankind that they eat nothing that is pre|pared for human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
            they never enter an hou&s;e to de&s;troy the provi&s;ions, but are con|tented
            with eating every root and vegetable that they meet. If they happen to pa&s;s
            through a meadow, they de&s;troy it in a very &s;hort time, and give it an
            appearance of being burnt up and &s;trewed with a&s;hes. If they are
            interrupted in their cour&s;e, and a man &s;hould imprudently venture to attack
            one of them, the little animal is no way intimidated by the di&s;parity of
            &s;trength, but furiou&s;ly flies up at its opponent, and, barking &s;omewhat
            like a puppy, wherever it fa&s;tens does not ea&s;ily quit the hold. If at
            la&s;t the leader be forced out of its line, which it defends as long as it
            can, and be &s;eparated from the re&s;t of its kind, it &s;ets up a plaintive 
            <PB N="88" REF="116"> cry different from that of anger, and, as &s;ome pretend
            to &s;ay, gives it&s;elf a voluntary death, by hanging it&s;elf on the fork of

<P>An enemy &s;o numerous and de&s;tructive would quickly render the
            countries where they appear utterly uninhabitable, did it not fortunately
            happen that the &s;ame rapacity that animates them to de&s;troy the labours of
            mankind, at la&s;t impels them to de&s;troy and devour each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictonnaire Rai&s;onn&eacute;e, vol. ii. p.
                610.</BIBL></NOTE>. After committing incredible deva&s;tations, they are at
            la&s;t &s;een to &s;eparate into two armies, op|po&s;ed with deadly hatred,
            along the coa&s;ts of the larger lakes and rivers. The Laplanders, who
            ob&s;erve them thus drawn up to fight, in&s;tead of con&s;idering their mutual
            animo&s;ities as an happy riddance of the mo&s;t dreadful pe&s;t, form omi|nous
            progno&s;tics from the manner of their ar|rangement. They con&s;ider their
            combats as a pre&s;age of war, and expect an inva&s;ion from the Ru&s;&s;ians
            or the Swedes, as the &s;ides next tho&s;e kingdoms happen to conquer. The two
            divi&s;ions, however, continue their engagements and animo&s;ity until one
            party overcomes the other. From that time they utterly di&s;appear, nor is it
            well known what becomes of either the conquerors or the conquered. Some
            &s;uppo&s;e that they ru&s;h headlong into the &s;ea, others that 
            <PB N="89" REF="117"> they kill them&s;elvs, as &s;ome are found hanging on the
            forked branches of a tree, and others &s;till that they are de&s;troyed by the
            young &s;pring herbage. But the mo&s;t probable opinion is, that, having
            devoured the vegetable produc|tions of the country, and having nothing more to
            &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, they then fall to devouring each other; and, having
            habituated them&s;elves to that kind of food, continue it. However this be,
            they are often found dead by thou&s;ands, and their carca&s;es have been known
            to infect the air for &s;everal miles round, &s;o as to produce very malignant
            di&s;orders. They &s;eem al&s;o to infect the plants they have gnawed, for the
            cattle often die that afterwards feed in the places where they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, the male is larger and more beautifully
            &s;potted than the female. They are extremely prolific; and what is
            extraordinary, their breeding does not hinder their march; for &s;ome of them
            have been ob&s;erved to carry one young one in their mouth and another on their
            back. They are greatly preyed upon by the ermine, and, as we are told, even by
            the rein|deer. The Swedes and Norwegians, who live by hu&s;bandry, con&s;ider
            an inva&s;ion from the&s;e vermin as a terrible vi&s;itation; but it is very
            different with re&s;pect to the Laplanders, who <PB N="90" REF="118"> lead a
            vagrant life, and who, like the lemings them&s;elves, if their provi&s;ions be
            de&s;troyed in one part of the country, can ea&s;ily retire to another. The&s;e
            are never &s;o happy as when an army of lemings come down among&s;t them; for
            then they fea&s;t upon their fle&s;h; which though horrid food, and which,
            though even dogs and cats are known to dete&s;t, the&s;e little &s;avages
            e&s;teem very good eating and devour greedily. They are glad of their arrival
            al&s;o upon another account, for they always expect a great plenty of game the
            year following, among tho&s;e fields which the lemings have de&s;troyed.</P>

<HEAD>THE MOLE.</HEAD>
<P>TO the&s;e minute animals of the rat kind, a great part of who&s;e
            lives is pa&s;t in holes under ground, I will &s;ubjoin one little animal more,
            no way re&s;embling the rat, except that its whole life is &s;pent there. As we
            have &s;een &s;ome quadrupedes formed to crop the &s;urface of the fields, and
            others to live upon the tops of trees, &s;o the Mole is formed to live wholly
            under the earth, as if Nature meant that no place &s;hould be left wholly
            untenanted. Were we from our own &s;en&s;ations to pronounce upon the life of a
            quadrupede that was never to ap|pear above ground, but always condemned to 
            <PB N="91" REF="119"> hunt for its prey underneath, obliged, whenever It
            removed from one place to another, to bore its way through a re&s;i&s;ting
            body, we &s;hould be apt to a&s;&s;ert that &s;uch an exi&s;tence mu&s;t be the
            mo&s;t frightful and &s;olitary in nature. However, in the pre&s;ent animal,
            though we find it con|demned to all tho&s;e &s;eeming inconveniencies, we
            &s;hall di&s;cover no &s;igns of wretchedne&s;s or di&s;tre&s;s. No quadrupede
            is fatter, none has a more &s;leek or glo&s;&s;y &s;kin; and, though denied
            many advantages that mo&s;t animals enjoy, it is more liberally
            po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of others, which they have in a more &s;canty proportion.</P>
<P>This animal, &s;o well known in England, is, however, utterly a
            &s;tranger in other places, and particularly in Ireland. For &s;uch,
            there|fore, as have never &s;een it, a &s;hort de&s;cription will be
            nece&s;&s;ary. And, in the fir&s;t place, though &s;omewhat of a &s;ize between
            the rat and the mou&s;e, it no way re&s;embles either, being an animal entirely
            of a &s;ingular kind, and perfectly unlike any other quadrupede whatever. It is
            bigger than a mou&s;e, with a coat of fine, &s;hort, glo&s;&s;y, black hair.
            Its no&s;e is long and pointed, re&s;embling that of an hog, but much longer.
            Its eyes are &s;o &s;mall that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern them.
            In&s;tead of ears it has only holes in the place. Its neck is &s;o &s;hort that
            the head <PB N="92" REF="120"> &s;eems &s;tuck upon the &s;houlders. The body
            is thick and round, terminating by a very &s;mall &s;hort tail, and its legs
            al&s;o are &s;o very &s;hort that the animal &s;eems to lie flat on its belly.
            From under its belly, as it re&s;ts in this po&s;ition, the four feet appear
            ju&s;t as if they immediately grew out of the body. Thus the animal appears to
            us at fir&s;t view as a ma&s;s of fle&s;h covered with a fine &s;hining black
            &s;kin, with a little head, and &s;carce any legs, eyes, or tail. On a clo&s;er
            in|&s;pection, however, two little black points may be di&s;cerned, that are
            its eyes. The ancients, and &s;ome of the moderns, were of opinion that the
            animal was utterly blind; but Derham, by the help of a micro&s;cope, plainly
            di&s;covered all the parts of the eye that are known in other animals, &s;uch
            as the pupil, the vitreous and the chry&s;taline humours. The fore-legs appear
            very &s;hort and &s;trong, and furni&s;hed with five claws to each. The&s;e are
            turned outwards and backwards, as the hands of a man when &s;wim|ming. The hind
            legs are longer and weaker than the fore, being only u&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t its
            mo|tions; whereas the others are continually em|ployed in digging. The teeth
            are like tho&s;e of a &s;hrew-mou&s;e, and there are five on both &s;ides of
            the upper jaw, which &s;tand out; but tho&s;e behind are divided into points.
            The tongue is as large as the mouth will hold.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="121">Such is the extraordinary figure and
            for|mation of this animal; which, if we compare with its manner of living, we
            &s;hall find a ma|nife&s;t attention in Nature to adapt the one to the
            other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. As it is
            allotted a &s;ubterraneous abode, the &s;eeming defects of its formation
            va|ni&s;h, or rather are turned to its advantage. The breadth, &s;trength, and
            &s;hortne&s;s of the fore feet, which are inclined outwards, an&s;wer the
            pur|po&s;es of digging, &s;erving to throw back the earth with greater ea&s;e,
            and to pur&s;ue the worms and in&s;ects which are its prey: had they been
            longer, the falling in of the earth would have prevented the quick repetition
            of its &s;trokes in working; or have obliged it to make a larger hole, in order
            to give room for their exertion. The form of the body is not le&s;s admirably
            contrived for its way of life. The fore part is thick and very mu&s;cular,
            giving great &s;trength to the action of the fore feet, enabling it to dig its
            way with amazing force and rapidity, either to pur&s;ue its prey, or elude the
            &s;earch of the mo&s;t active enemy. By its power of boring the earth, it
            quickly gets be|low the &s;urface; and I have &s;een it, when let loo&s;e in
            the mid&s;t of a field, like the gho&s;t on a theatre, in&s;tantly &s;ink into
            the earth; and the <PB N="94" REF="122"> mo&s;t active labourer, with a
            &s;pade, in vain at|tempted to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The &s;mallne&s;s of its eyes, which induced the ancients to think
            it was blind, is, to this ani|nimal, a peculiar advantage. A &s;mall degree of
            vi&s;ion is &s;ufficient for a creature that is ever de&s;tined to live in
            darkne&s;s. A more exten&s;ive &s;ight would only have &s;erved to &s;hew the
            hor|rors of its pri&s;on, while Nature had denied it the means of an e&s;cape.
            Had this organ been larger, it would have been perpetually liable to injuries,
            by the falling of the earth into it; but Nature, to prevent that inconvenience,
            has not only made them very &s;mall, but very clo&s;ely covered them with hair.
            Anatomi&s;ts mention, be&s;ide the&s;e advantages, another, that con|tributes
            to their &s;ecurity; namely, a certain mu&s;cle, by which the animal can draw
            back the eye whenever it is nece&s;&s;ary or in danger.</P>
<P>As the eye is thus perfectly fitted to the animal's &s;ituation,
            &s;o al&s;o are the &s;en&s;es of hear|ing and &s;melling. The fir&s;t gives it
            notice of the mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance of danger; the other directs it, in
            the mid&s;t of darkne&s;s, to its food. The wants of a &s;ubterraneous animal
            can be but few; and the&s;e are &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply them: to eat, and to
            produce its kind, are the whole employments of &s;uch a life; and for

<P>Thus admirably is this animal fitted for a life of darkne&s;s and
            &s;olitude; with no appetites but what it can ea&s;ily indulge, with no enemies
            but what it can ea&s;ily evade or conquer. As &s;oon as it has once buried
            it&s;elf in the earth, it &s;eldom &s;tirs out, unle&s;s forced by violent
            rains in &s;ummer, or when in pur&s;uit of its prey, it happens to come too
            near the &s;urface, and thus gets into the open air, which may be con&s;idered
            as its unnatural element. In general, it chu&s;es the loo&s;er &s;ofter
            grounds, beneath which it can travel with greater ea&s;e; in &s;uch al&s;o it
            generally finds the greate&s;t number of worms and in&s;ects, upon which it
            chiefly preys. It is ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t active, and to ca&s;t up mo&s;t
            earth, im|mediately before rain; and, in winter, before <PB N="96" REF="124"> a

            approach the &s;urface, whither this indu&s;trious animal pur&s;ues them. On
            the contrary, in very dry weather, the mole &s;eldom or never forms any
            hillocks; for then it is obliged to penetrate deeper after its prey, which at
            &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons retire far into the ground.</P>
<P>As the moles very &s;eldom come above ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, they have but few enemies; and very
            readily evade the pur&s;uit of animals &s;tronger and &s;wifter than
            them&s;elves. Their greate&s;t calamity is an inundation; which, wherever it
            happens, they are &s;een, in numbers, attempting to &s;ave them&s;elves by

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Hedge-hog, or prickly Kind.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the Hedge-hog kind require but very little accuracy to
          di&s;tingui&s;h them from all others. That hair which &s;erves the generality
          of quadrupedes for warmth and or|nament, is partly wanting in the&s;e; while
          its place is &s;upplied by &s;harp &s;pines or prickles, that &s;erve for their
          defence. This general cha|racteri&s;tic, therefore, makes a much more ob|vious
          di&s;tinction than any that can be taken from their teeth or their claws.
          Nature, by this extraordinary peculiarity, &s;eems to have &s;e|parated them in
          a very di&s;tingui&s;hed manner; &s;o that, in&s;tead of cla&s;&s;ing the
          hedge-hog among the moles, or the porcupine with the hare, as &s;ome have done,
          it is much more natural and obvious to place them, and others approaching them
          in this &s;trange peculiarity, in a cla&s;s by them&s;elves: nor let it be
          &s;uppo&s;ed, that while I thus alter their arrangement, and &s;eparate them
          from animals with which they have been for|merly combined, that I am
          de&s;troying any &s;ecret affinities that exi&s;t in nature. It is natural,
          in|deed, for readers to &s;uppo&s;e, when they &s;ee two <PB N="100" REF="131">
          &s;uch oppo&s;ite animals as the hare and the porcupine a&s;&s;embled together
          in the &s;ame groupe, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome material rea|&s;on, &s;ome
          &s;ecret connexion, for thus joining animals &s;o little re&s;embling each
          other in appearance. But the rea&s;ons for this union were very &s;light, and
          merely aro&s;e from a &s;imi|litude in the fore teeth: no likene&s;s in the
          in|ternal conformation; no &s;imilitude in nature, in habitudes, or
          di&s;po&s;ition; in &s;hort, nothing to fa&s;ten the link that combines them,
          but the &s;imilitude in the teeth: this, therefore, may be ea&s;ily
          di&s;pen&s;ed with; and, as was &s;aid, it will be mo&s;t proper to cla&s;s
          them according to their mo&s;t &s;triking &s;imilitudes.</P>
<P>The Hedge-hog, with an appearance the mo&s;t formidable, is yet one
          of the mo&s;t harmle&s;s animals in the world: unable or unwilling to offend,
          all its precautions are only directed to its own &s;ecurity; and it is armed
          with a thou|&s;and points, to keep off the enemy, but not to invade him. While
          other creatures tru&s;t to their force, their cunning, or their &s;wiftne&s;s,
          this animal, de&s;titute of all, has but one ex|pedient for &s;afety; and from
          this alone it often finds protection. As &s;oon as it perceives it&s;elf
          attacked, it withdraws all its vulnerable parts, rolls it&s;elf into a ball,
          and pre&s;ents nothing but its defen&s;ive thorns to the enemy; thus, while 
          <PB N="101" REF="132"> it attempts to injure no other quadrupede, they are
          equally incapable of injuring it: like tho&s;e knights, we have &s;omewhere
          read of, who were armed in &s;uch a manner, that they could neither conquer
          others, nor be them&s;elves over|come.</P>
<P>This animal is of two kinds; one with a no&s;e like the &s;nout of
          an hog; the other, more &s;hort and blunt, like that of a dog. That with the
          muzzle of a dog is the mo&s;t common, being about &s;ix inches in length, from
          the tip of the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail. The tail is little more
          than an inch long; and &s;o concealed by the &s;pines, as to be &s;carce
          vi&s;ible: the head, back, and &s;ides, are covered with prickles; the no&s;e,
          brea&s;t, and belly, are covered with fine &s;oft hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praeputium propendeus. 
            <BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;t. 75.</BIBL> And of the female he might have
            &s;aid, re&s;upina copulatur.</NOTE>; the legs are &s;hort, of a du&s;ky
          colour, and almo&s;t bare; the toes on each foot are five in number, long and
          &s;eparated; the prickles are about an inch in length, and very &s;harp
          pointed; their lower part is white, the middle black, and the points white: the
          eyes are &s;mall, and placed high in the head; the ears are round, pretty
          large, and naked; the mouth is &s;mall, but well furni&s;hed with teeth;
          the&s;e, however, it only u&s;es in chewing its food, <PB N="102" REF="133">
          but neither in attacking or defending it&s;elf again&s;t other animals. Its
          only reliance in ca&s;es of danger, is on its &s;pines; the in&s;tant it
          per|ceives an enemy, it puts it&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence, and keeps
          upon its guard until it &s;uppo&s;es the danger over. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, it
          immediately alters its whole appearance: from its u&s;ual form, &s;omewhat
          re&s;embling a &s;mall animal, with a bunch on its back, the animal begins to
          bend its back, to lay its head upon its brea&s;t, to &s;hut its eyes, to roll
          down the &s;kin of its &s;ides towards the legs, to draw the&s;e up, and,
          la&s;tly, to tuck them in on every &s;ide, by drawing the &s;kin &s;till
          clo&s;er. In this form, which the hedge-hog always puts on when di&s;turbed, it
          no way re&s;embles an animal, but rather a roundi&s;h ma&s;s of prickles,
          impervious on every &s;ide. The &s;hape of the animal thus rolled up,
          &s;omewhat re&s;embles a che&s;tnut in the hu&s;k; there being, on one &s;ide,
          a kind of flat &s;pace, which is that on which the head and legs have been
          tucked in.</P>
<P>Such is the u&s;ual appearance of the hedge-hog, upon the approach
          of any danger. Thus rolled up in a lump, it patiently waits till its enemy
          pa&s;&s;es by, or is fatigued with fruitle&s;s attempts to annoy it. The cat,
          the wea&s;el, the ferret, and the martin, quickly decline the combat; and the
          dog him&s;elf generally &s;pends <PB N="103" REF="134"> his time in empty
          menaces, rather than in ef|fectual efforts. Every encrea&s;e of danger only
          encrea&s;es the animal's precautions to keep on its guard; its a&s;&s;ailant
          vainly attempts to bite, &s;ince he thus more frequently feels than inflicts a
          wound; he &s;tands enraged and barking, and rolls it along with his paws;
          &s;till, however, the hedge-hog patiently &s;ubmits to every indignity, but
          continues &s;ecure; and &s;till more to di&s;gu&s;t its enemy with the
          conte&s;t, &s;heds its urine, the &s;mell of which is alone &s;ufficient to
          &s;end him away. In this manner the dog, after barking for &s;ome time, leaves
          the hedge-hog where he found him; who perceiving the danger pa&s;t, at length
          peeps out from its ball, and, if not in|terrupted, creeps &s;lowly to its
          retreat.</P>
<P>The hedge-hog, like mo&s;t other wild ani|mals, &s;leeps by day, and
          ventures out by night. It generally re&s;ides in &s;mall thickets, in hedges,
          or in ditches covered with bu&s;hes; there it makes an hole of about &s;ix or
          eight inches deep, and lies well wrapped up, in mo&s;s, gra&s;s, or leaves. Its
          food is roots, fruits, worms, and in&s;ects. It is al&s;o &s;aid to &s;uck
          cattle, and hurt their udders; but the &s;mallne&s;s of its mouth will &s;erve
          to clear it from this reproach. It is &s;aid al&s;o to be very hurtful in
          gardens and orchards, where it will roll it&s;elf in <PB N="104" REF="135"> an
          heap of fruit, and &s;o carry a large quantity away upon its prickles; but this
          imputation is as ill grounded as the former, &s;ince the &s;pines are &s;o
          di&s;po&s;ed, that no fruit will &s;tick upon them, even if we &s;hould try to
          fix them on. It rather appears to be a very &s;erviceable animal, in ridding
          our fields of in&s;ects and worms, which are &s;o prejudicial to
          vegetation.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon, who kept the&s;e animals tame about his hou&s;e, acquits
          them of the reproach of being mi&s;chievous in the garden; but then he
          accu&s;es them of tricks, of which from the form and habits of this animal one
          would be never led to &s;u&s;pect them. 
          <Q REND="inline">"I have often," &s;ays he, "had the female and her
            young brought me about the beginning of June: they are generally from three to
            five in number: they are white in the beginning, and only the marks of their
            &s;pines appear: I was willing to rear &s;ome of them, and accordingly put the
            dam and her young into a tub, with abundant provi&s;ion be&s;ide them; but the
            old animal, in&s;tead of &s;uckling her young, devoured them all, one after
            another. On another occa&s;ion, an hedge-hog that had made its way into the
            kitchen, di&s;covered a little pot, in which there was meat prepared for
            boiling; the mi&s;chievous animal drew out the meat, and left its excrements in

            po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in miniature, the Porcupine has in a more enlarged degree.
            The &s;hort prickles of the hedge-hog are in this animal con|verted into
            &s;hafts. In the one the &s;pines are about an inch long; in the other, a foot.
            The porcupine is about two feet long, and fifteen inches high. Like the

            animal's &s;kin, in the &s;ame manner as feathers are found to grow upon birds.
            It is within &s;ide &s;pongy, like the top <PB REF="146">

            goo&s;e-quill; and of different colours, being white and black alternately,
            from one end to the other. The bigge&s;t are often found fifteen inches long,
            and a quarter of an inch in diameter; extremely &s;harp, and capable of
            inflicting a mortal wound. They &s;eem harder than common quills, being
            difficult to be cut, and &s;olid at that end which is not fixed in the &s;kin.
            If we examine them in common, as they grow upon the animal, they appear of two
            kinds; the one &s;uch as I have already de|&s;cribed; the other, long, flexible
            and &s;lender, growing here and there among the former. There is &s;till
            another &s;ort of quills, that grow near the tail, white and tran&s;parent,
            like writing quills, and that &s;eem to be cut &s;hort at the end. All the&s;e
            quills, of what&s;oever kind, incline backwards, like the bri&s;tles of an hog;
            but when the animal is irritated, they ri&s;e, and &s;tand upright, as
            bri&s;tles are &s;een to do.</P>
<P>Such is the formation of this quadrupede, in tho&s;e parts in
            which it differs from mo&s;t others: as to the re&s;t of its figure, the muzzle
            bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of an hare, but black; the legs are very
            &s;hort, and the feet have five toes, both before and behind; and the&s;e, as
            well as the belly, the head, and all other parts of the body, are covered with
            a &s;ort of &s;hort hair, like <PB N="109" REF="149"> prickles, there being no
            part, except the ears and the &s;ole of the foot, that is free from them: the
            ears are thinly covered with very fine hair; and are in &s;hape like tho&s;e of
            mankind: the eyes are &s;mall, like tho&s;e of an hog, being only one third of
            an inch from one corner to the other. After the &s;kin is taken off, there
            appear a kind of paps on tho&s;e parts of the body from whence the large quills
            proceed; the&s;e are about the &s;ize of a &s;mall pea, each an&s;wering to as
            many holes which appear on the outward &s;urface of the &s;kin, and which are
            about half an inch deep, like as many hollow pipes, wherein the quills are
            fixed, as in &s;o many &s;heaths.</P>
<P>This animal &s;eems to partake very much of the nature of the
            hedge-hog; having this for|midable apparatus of arms rather to defend
            it|&s;elf, than annoy the enemy. There have been, indeed, many naturali&s;ts
            who &s;uppo&s;ed that it was capable of di&s;charging them at its foes, and
            killing at a great di&s;tance off. But this opinion has been entirely
            di&s;credited of late; and it is now univer&s;ally believed that its quills
            remain firmly fixed in the &s;kin, and are then only &s;hed when the animal
            moults them, as birds do their feathers. It is true, we are told by Ellis, that
            a wolf at Hud&s;on's Bay was found dead, with the quills of a porcupine fixed
            within its mouth; <PB N="110" REF="150"> which might have very well happened,
            from the voraciou&s;ne&s;s of the former, and not the re&s;entment of the
            latter. That rapacious crea|ture, in the rage of appetite, might have
            at|tempted to devour the porcupine, quills and all, and very probably paid the
            forfeit, by its life. However this be, of all the porcupines that have been
            brought into Europe, not one was ever &s;een to launch their quills; and yet
            the irritations they received were &s;ufficient to have provoked their utmo&s;t
            indignation. Of all the porcupines that Doctor Shaw ob&s;erved in Africa, and
            he &s;aw numbers, not one ever attempted to dart its quills; their u&s;ual
            manner of defence being, to lie on one &s;ide, and when the enemy approaches
            very near, by &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, to wound him with the points on the
            other.</P>
<P>It is probable, therefore, that the porcupine is &s;eldom the
            aggre&s;&s;or; and when attacked by the bolder animals, it only directs its
            quills &s;o as to keep always pointing towards the enemy. The&s;e are an ample
            protection; and, as we are a&s;&s;ured by Kolben, at &s;uch times, even the
            lion him&s;elf will not venture to make an attack. From &s;uch, therefore, the
            porcupine can defend it&s;elf; and chiefly hunts for &s;erpents, and all other
            reptiles, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Travellers uni|ver&s;ally a&s;&s;ure us that,
            between the &s;erpent and <PB N="111" REF="151"> the porcupine there exi&s;ts
            an irreconcileable enmity, and that they never meet without a mortal
            engagement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bo&s;man. Smith. L. P. Vincent Marie,
                &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. The porcupine, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is &s;aid to roll
            it&s;elf upon the &s;erpent, and thus de&s;troy and devour it. This may be
            true; while what we are informed by Mon&s;ieur Sarra&s;in, of the porcupine of
            Canada chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on vegetables, may be equally &s;o. Tho&s;e
            which are brought to this country to be &s;hewn, are u&s;ually fed on bread,
            milk, and fruits; but they will not refu&s;e meat when it is offered them; and
            it is probable, they prefer it in a wild &s;tate, when it is to be had<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. The porcupine is al&s;o
            known to be extremely hurt|ful to gardens; and, where it enters, does
            in|credible damage.</P>
<P>The Americans, who hunt this animal, a&s;&s;ure us, that the
            porcupine lives from twelve to fif|teen years. During the time of coupling,
            which is in the month of September, the males become very fierce and dangerous,
            and often are &s;een to de&s;troy each other with their teeth. The female goes
            with young &s;even months, and brings forth but one at a time; this &s;he
            &s;uckles but about a month, and accu&s;toms it betimes to live, like
            her&s;elf, upon vegetables and the <PB N="112" REF="152"> bark of trees; &s;he
            is very fierce in its defence; but, at other &s;ea&s;ons, &s;he is fearful,
            timid, and harmle&s;s. The porcupine never attempts to bite, nor any way to
            injure its pur&s;uers: if hunted by a dog or a wolf, it in&s;tantly climbs up a
            tree, and continues there until it has wearied out the patience of its
            adver&s;ary; the wolf knows by experience how fruitle&s;s it would be to wait,
            he therefore leaves the porcupine above, and &s;eeks out for a new
            adventure.</P>
<P>The porcupine does not e&s;cape &s;o well from the Indian hunter,
            who eagerly pur&s;ues it, in order to make embroidery of its quills, and to eat
            its fle&s;h. This, as we are commonly told, is very tolerable eating; however,
            we may ex|pect wretched provi&s;ions when the &s;avages are to be our caterers,
            for they eat every thing that has life. But they are very ingenious with regard
            to their embroidery: if I under&s;tand the accounts rightly, they dye the
            quills of va|rious colours, and then &s;plitting them into &s;lips, as we &s;ee
            in the making of a cane-chair, they embroider, with the&s;e, their belts,
            ba&s;kets, and &s;everal other nece&s;&s;ary pieces of furniture.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, there are many things related concerning this
            animal that are fabulous; but there are &s;till many circum&s;tances more, that
            yet remain to be known. It were curious to <PB N="113" REF="153"> enquire
            whether this animal molts its quills when wild, for it is never &s;een to
            &s;hed them in a dome&s;tic &s;tate; whether it &s;leeps all the winter, as we
            are told by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, which we are &s;ure it does not when brought
            into our country; and, la&s;tly, whether its quills can be &s;ent off with a
            &s;hake; for no le&s;s a na|turali&s;t than Reaumur was of that opinion.</P>
<P>All that we can learn of an animal expo&s;ed as a &s;hew, or even
            by its di&s;&s;ection, is but merely its conformation; and that makes one of
            the lea&s;t intere&s;ting parts of its hi&s;tory. We are natu|rally led, when
            pre&s;ented with an extraordinary creature, to expect &s;omething extraordinary
            in its way of living, &s;omething uncommon, and cor|&s;ponding with its figure;
            but of this animal we know little with any preci&s;ion, except what it offers
            in a &s;tate of captivity. In &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that which I &s;aw,
            appeared to very little advantage: it was extremely dull and torpid, though
            very wakeful; and extremely voracious, though very capable of &s;u&s;taining
            hunger; as aver&s;e to any attachment, as to being tamed: it was kept in an
            iron cage, and the touching one of the bars was &s;ufficient to excite its
            re&s;ent|ment, for its quills were in&s;tantly erected; and the poet was right
            in his epithet of fretful, for <PB N="114" REF="154"> it appeared to me the
            mo&s;t ira&s;cible creature upon earth.</P>
<P>The porcupines of America differ very much from that of the
            ancient continent, which we have been de&s;cribing; and, &s;trictly &s;peaking,
            may be con&s;idered as animals of a different &s;pecies: however, from their
            being covered with quills, we will only add them as varieties of the former,
            &s;ince we know very little con|cerning them, except their difference of
            figure. They are of two kinds; the one called the Couando; and the other,
            fir&s;t named by Mr. Buffon, the Ur&s;on: the one a native of the northern
            parts of America; the other of the &s;outh; and both differing from the former,
            in having long tails, whereas that has a very &s;hort one.</P>
<P>The Couando is much le&s;s than the por|cupine; its quills are
            four times &s;horter, its &s;nout more unlike that of an hare; its tail is long
            enough to catch by the branches of trees, and hold by them. It may be ea&s;ily
            tamed, and is to be found chiefly in the &s;outhern parts of America; yet is
            not wanting al&s;o in the northern.</P>
<P>The Ur&s;on, which Mr. Buffon calls after our countryman Hud&s;on,
            is a native of Hud|&s;on's Bay. The make of the body of this 
            <PB N="115" REF="155"> animal is not &s;o round as that of the two for|mer, but
            &s;omewhat re&s;embling the &s;hape of a pig. It is covered with long bri&s;tly
            hair, with a &s;horter hair underneath; and under this the quills lie concealed
            very thick; they are white, with a brown point, and bearded, and the longe&s;t
            do not exceed four inches; they &s;tick to the hand when the animal is
            &s;troked on the back; and likewi&s;e, when the hand is taken away, they
            &s;tick &s;o fa&s;t as to follow it. They make their ne&s;t under the roots of
            great trees, &s;leep very much, and chiefly feed upon the bark of the juniper.
            In winter the &s;now &s;erves them for drink; and in &s;ummer they lap water,
            like a dog. They are very common in the country lying to the ea&s;t of
            Hud&s;on's Bay; and &s;everal of the trading Americans depend on them for food,
            at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Quadrupedes covered with Scales or Shells in&s;tead
          of Hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is chiefly extracted from Mr.
            Buffon, which I mention at once, to &s;ave the trouble of repeated
            quotation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we talk of a quadrupede, the name &s;eems to imply an animal
          covered with hair; when we mention a bird, it is natural to conceive a creature
          covered with feathers; when we hear of a fi&s;h, its &s;cales are generally the
          fir&s;t part that &s;trikes our imagination. Nature, however, owns none of our
          di&s;tinctions; various in all her operations, &s;he mixes her plans, groupes
          her pictures, and excites our wonder as well by her general laws as by her
          deviations. Quadru|pedes, which we have con&s;idered as making the fir&s;t
          general cla&s;s in animated nature, and next to man the mo&s;t dignified
          tenants of the earth, are yet in many re&s;pects related to the cla&s;&s;es
          beneath them, and do not in every re&s;pect pre|&s;erve their u&s;ual
          di&s;tinctions. Their fir&s;t cha|racter, which con&s;i&s;ts in having four
          feet, is <PB N="117" REF="157"> common to the lizard kind as well as to them.
          The &s;econd prerogative, which is that of bring|ing forth living young, is
          found in the cetaceous tribe of fi&s;hes, and al&s;o in in&s;ects without
          num|ber. Their third and la&s;t attribute, which &s;eems more general and
          con&s;tant than the former, that of being covered with hair, is yet found in
          various other animals, and is deficient in quadrupedes them&s;elves. Thus we
          mu&s;t be cautious of judging of the nature of animals from one &s;ingle
          character, which is always found incomplete; for it often happens that three or
          four of the mo&s;t general characters will not &s;uffice. It mu&s;t be by a
          general enumeration of the parts that we can determine preci&s;ely of the works
          of the creation; and, in&s;tead of de|finitions, learn to de&s;cribe. Had this
          method been followed, much of the di&s;gu&s;t and the in|tricacy of hi&s;tory
          might have been avoided, and that time, which is now employed in combating
          error, laid out in the promoting of &s;cience.</P>
<P>Were we to judge of nature from definitions only, we &s;hould never
          be induced to &s;uppo&s;e that there exi&s;ted races of viviparous quadru|pedes
          de&s;titute of hair, and furni&s;hed with &s;cales and &s;hells in their
          &s;tead. However, nature, every way various, &s;upplies us with many
          in|&s;tances <PB N="118" REF="158"> of the&s;e extraordinary creatures; the old
          world has its quadrupedes covered with &s;cales, and the new with a &s;hell. In
          both they re&s;emble each other, as well in the &s;trangene&s;s of their
          appetites as in their aukward conformation. Like animals but partially made up,
          and par|taking of different natures, they want tho&s;e in|&s;tincts which
          animals formed but for one ele|ment alone are found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. They
          &s;eem to be a kind of &s;trangers in nature, creatures taken from &s;ome other
          element, and capriciou&s;ly thrown to find a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon
          land.</P>
<P>The Pangolin, which has been u&s;ually called the Scaly Lizard, Mr.
          Buffon very judiciou&s;ly re&s;tores to that denomination by which it is known
          in the countries where it is found The calling it a lizard, he ju&s;tly
          ob&s;erves, might be apt to produce error, and occa&s;ion its being confounded
          with an animal which it re&s;embles only in its general form, and in its being
          covered with &s;cales. The lizard may be con&s;idered as a reptile, produced
          from an egg; the pangolin is a quadrupede, and brought forth alive and
          perfectly formed. The lizard is all over covered with the marks of &s;cales;
          the pangolin has &s;cales neither on the throat, the brea&s;t, or the

          &s;eem &s;tuck upon the body even clo&s;er than tho&s;e of fi&s;hes; the
          &s;cales of the pangolin are only fixed at one end, and capable of being
          erected, like tho&s;e of the porcupine, at the will of the animal. The lizard
          is a defencele&s;s creature; the pangolin can roll it&s;elf into a ball, like
          the hedge-hog, and pre&s;ent the points of its &s;cales to the enemy, which
          effectually defend it.</P>
<P>The Pangolin, which is a native of the torrid climates of the
          ancient continent, is, of all other animals, the be&s;t protected from external
          in|jury by Nature. It is about three or four feet long, or, taking in the tail,
          from &s;ix to eight. Like the lizard, it has a &s;mall head, a very long
          no&s;e, a &s;hort thick neck, a long body, legs very &s;hort, and a tail
          extremely long, thick at the in&s;ertion, and terminating in a point. It has no
          teeth, but is armed with five toes on each foot, with long white claws. But
          what it is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by is its &s;caly covering, which in
          &s;ome mea&s;ure hides all the proportions of its body. The&s;e &s;cales defend
          the animal on all parts, except the under part of the head and neck, under the
          &s;houlders, the brea&s;t, the belly, and the inner &s;ide of the legs; all
          which parts are covered with a &s;mooth &s;oft &s;kin, with|out <PB REF="161">

          <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="120" REF="163"> hair.
          Between the &s;hells of this animal, at all the inter&s;tices, are &s;een hairs
          like bri&s;tles, brown at the extremity and yellow towards the root. The
          &s;cales of this extraordinary creature are of different &s;izes and different
          forms, and &s;tuck upon the body &s;omewhat like the leaves of an artichoak.
          The large&s;t are found near the tail, which is covered with them like the
          re&s;t of the body. The&s;e are above three inches broad, and about two inches
          long, thick in the middle and &s;harp at the edges, and terminated in a
          roundi&s;h point. They are extremely hard, and their &s;ub&s;tance re&s;embles
          that of horn. They are convex on the out&s;ide and a little con|cave on the
          inner; one edge &s;ticks in the &s;kin, while the other laps over that
          immediately be|hind it. Tho&s;e that cover the tail conform to the &s;hape of
          that part, being of a du&s;ky brown colour, and &s;o hard, when the animal has
          ac|quired its full growth, as to turn a mu&s;quet-ball.</P>
<P>Thus armed, this animal fears nothing from the efforts of all other
          creatures, except man. The in&s;tant it perceives the approach of an enemy, it
          rolls it&s;elf up like the hedge-hog, and pre&s;ents no part but the cutting
          edges of its &s;cales to the a&s;&s;ailant. Its long tail, which, 
          <PB N="121" REF="164"> at fir&s;t view, might be thought ea&s;ily &s;eparable,
          &s;erves &s;till more to encrea&s;e the animal's &s;e|curity. This is lapped
          round the re&s;t of the body, and, being defended with &s;hells even more
          cutting than any other part, the creature continues in perfect &s;ecurity. Its
          &s;hells are &s;o large, &s;o thick, and &s;o pointed, that they repel every
          animal of prey; they make a coat of ar|mour that wounds while it re&s;i&s;ts,
          and at once protects and threatens. The mo&s;t cruel, the mo&s;t fami&s;hed
          quadrupede of the fore&s;t, the tiger, the panther, and the hyena, make vain
          attempts to force it. They tread upon, they roll it about, but all to no
          purpo&s;e; the pangolin remains &s;afe within, while its invader almo&s;t
          always feels the reward of its ra&s;hne&s;s. The fox often de&s;troys the
          hedge-hog by pre&s;&s;ing it with his weight, and thus obliges it to put forth
          its no&s;e, which he in|&s;tantly &s;eizes, and &s;oon after the whole body;
          but the &s;cales of the pangolin effectually &s;up|port it under any &s;uch
          weight, while nothing that the &s;tronge&s;t animals are capable of doing can
          compel it to &s;urrender. Man alone &s;eems furni&s;hed with arms to conquer
          its ob&s;tinacy. The Negroes of Africa, when they find it, beat it to death
          with clubs, and con&s;ider its fle&s;h as a very great delicacy.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="165">But, although this animal be &s;o formidable
          in its appearance, there cannot be a more harm|le&s;s inoffen&s;ive creature
          when unmole&s;ted. It is even unqualified by Nature to injure larger animals,
          if it had the di&s;po&s;ition, for it has no teeth. It &s;hould &s;eem that the
          bony matter, which goes in other animals to &s;upply the teeth, is exhau&s;ted
          in this in &s;upplying the &s;cales that go to the covering of its body.
          However this be, its life &s;eems corre&s;pondent to its peculiar conformation.
          Incapable of being carnivorous, &s;ince it has no teeth, nor of
          &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on ve|getables, which require much chewing, it lives entirely
          upon in&s;ects, for which Nature has fitted it in a very extraordinary manner.
          As it has a long no&s;e, &s;o it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a long
          tongue; but, to encrea&s;e its length &s;till more, it is doubled in the mouth,
          &s;o that when extended it is &s;hot out to above a quarter of a yard beyond
          the tip of the no&s;e. This tongue is round, extremely red, and covered with an
          unctuous and &s;limy liquor, which gives it a &s;hining hue. When the pangolin,
          therefore, approaches an ant hill, for the&s;e are the in&s;ects on which it
          chiefly feeds, it lies down near it, concealing as much as po&s;&s;ible the
          place of its retreat, and &s;tretching out its long tongue 
          <PB N="123" REF="166"> among the ants, keeps it for &s;ome time quite
          immoveable. The&s;e little animals, allured by its appearance, and the unctuous
          &s;ub&s;tance with which it is imeared, in&s;tantly gather upon it in great
          numbers; and when the pangolin &s;uppo&s;es a &s;ufficiency, it quickly
          withdraws the tongue, and &s;wallows them at once. This peculiar manner of
          hunting for its prey is repeated either till it be &s;atisfied, or till the
          ants, grown more cautious, will be allured to their de&s;truction no longer. It
          is again&s;t the&s;e noxious in&s;ects, therefore, that its only force or
          cunning is exerted; and were the Negroes but &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of its
          utility in de&s;troying one of the greate&s;t pe&s;ts to their country, they
          would not be &s;o eager to kill it. But it is the nature of &s;avage man to
          pur&s;ue the immediate good, with|out being &s;olicitous about the more
          di&s;tant be|nefit they remove. They, therefore, hunt this animal, with the
          utmo&s;t avidity, for its fle&s;h; and, as it is &s;low and unable to e&s;cape
          in an open place, they &s;eldom fail of de&s;troying it. However, it chiefly
          keeps in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure parts of the fore&s;t, and digs it&s;elf a
          retreat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young, &s;o that it
          is but rarely met with, and continues a &s;olitary &s;pecies, and an
          extraor|dinary in&s;tance of the varying of Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="167">Of this animal, there is a variety which is
          called the Phatagin, much le&s;s than the former, being not above a foot long
          from the head to the tail, with &s;hells differently formed, with its belly,
          brea&s;t, and throat covered with hair, in|&s;tead of a &s;mooth &s;kin as in
          the former; but that by which it is peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed is the ex|tent
          of its tail, which is above twice the length of its body. Both are found in the
          warm lati|tudes of the Ea&s;t, as well as in Africa; and, as their numbers are

<P>HAVING mentioned quadrupedes of the ancient continent covered with

            remote de&s;erts where they have no enemies but &s;uch as they are enabled to
            oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Armadillo is chiefly an inhabitant of South America; a
            peaceful harmle&s;s creature, incapable of offending any other quadrupede, and
            furni&s;hed with a peculiar covering for its own defence. The pangolin,
            de&s;cribed above, &s;eems an inactive helple&s;s being, indebted for &s;afety
            more to its patience than its power; but the armadillo is &s;till more
            expo&s;ed and help|le&s;s. The pangolin is furni&s;hed with an armour that
            wounds while it re&s;i&s;ts, and that is never attacked with impunity; but the
            armadillo is obliged to &s;ubmit to every in&s;ult, without any power of
            repelling its enemy; it is attacked without danger, and is con&s;equently
            liable to more various per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>This animal being covered, like a tortoi&s;e, with a &s;hell, or
            rather a number of &s;hells, its other proportions are not ea&s;ily
            di&s;cerned. It appears, at fir&s;t view, a round mi&s;hapen ma&s;s, with a
            long head, and a very large tail &s;ticking out at either end, as if not of a
            piece with the <PB N="126" REF="172"> re&s;t of the body. It is of different
            &s;izes, from a foot to three feet long, and covered with a &s;hell divided
            into &s;everal pieces, that lap over each other like the plates in a coat of
            armour, or in the tail of a lob&s;ter. The difference in the &s;ize of this
            animal, and al&s;o the different di&s;|po&s;ition and number of its plates,
            have been con&s;idered as con&s;tituting &s;o many &s;pecies, each marked with
            its own particular name. In all, however, the animal is partially covered with
            this natural coat of mail; the confirmation of which affords one of the mo&s;t
            &s;triking curio&s;ities in natural hi&s;tory. This &s;hell, which in every
            re&s;pect re&s;embles a bony &s;ub&s;tance, covers the head, the neck, the
            back, the &s;ides, the rump, and the tail to the very point. The only parts to
            which it does not extend are, the throat, the brea&s;t, and the belly, which
            are covered with a white &s;oft &s;kin, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of a fowl
            &s;tripped of its feathers. If the&s;e naked parts be ob&s;erved with
            attention, they will be found covered with the rudiments of &s;hells, of the
            &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with tho&s;e which cover the back. The &s;kin, even in the
            parts that are &s;ofte&s;t, &s;eems to have a tendency to o&s;&s;ify; but a
            complete o&s;&s;ification takes place only on tho&s;e parts which have the
            lea&s;t friction and are the <PB N="127" REF="173"> mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the
            weather. The &s;hell, which covers the upper part of the body, differs from
            that of the tortoi&s;e, in being compo&s;ed of more pieces than one, which lie
            in bands over the body, and, as in the tail of the lob&s;ter, &s;lide over each
            other, and are connected by a yellow membrane in the &s;ame manner. By this
            means the animal has a motion in its back, and the armour gives way to its
            nece&s;&s;ary inflexions. The&s;e bands are of various numbers and &s;izes, and
            from them the&s;e animals have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into various kinds. In
            general, how|ever, there are two large pieces that cover, one the &s;houlders
            and the other the rump. In the back, between the&s;e, the bands are placed in
            different numbers, that lap over each other, and give play to the whole.
            Be&s;ides their open|ing cro&s;s-ways, they al&s;o open down along the back,
            &s;o that the animal can move in every di|rection. In &s;ome there are but
            three of the&s;e bands between the large pieces; in others there are &s;ix; in
            a third kind there are eight; in a fourth kind, nine; in a fifth kind, twelve;
            and, la&s;tly, in the &s;ixth kind there is but one large piece, which covers
            the &s;houlders, and the re&s;t of the body is covered with bands all down to
            the tail. The&s;e &s;hells are differently coloured <PB N="128" REF="174"> in
            different kinds, but mo&s;t u&s;ually they are of a dirty grey. This colour in
            all ari&s;es from another peculiar circum&s;tance in their confor|mation, for
            the &s;hell it&s;elf is covered with a &s;ofti&s;h &s;kin, which is &s;mooth
            and tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>But, although the&s;e &s;hells might ea&s;ily defend this animal
            from a feeble enemy, yet they could make but a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance
            again&s;t a more powerful antagoni&s;t; Nature, therefore, has given the
            armadillo the &s;ame method of pro|tecting it&s;elf with the hedge-hog or the
            pan|golin. The in&s;tant it perceives it&s;elf attacked, it withdraws the head
            under its &s;hells, and lets nothing be &s;een but the tip of the no&s;e; if
            the danger encrea&s;es, the animal's precautions en|crea&s;e in proportion; it
            then tucks up its feet under its belly, unites its two extremities to|gether,
            while the tail &s;eems as a band to &s;trengthen the connection; and it thus
            becomes like a ball, a little flatti&s;h on each &s;ide. In this po&s;ition it
            continues ob&s;tinately fixed, while the danger is near, and often long after
            it is over. In this &s;ituation it is to&s;&s;ed about at the plea&s;ure of
            every other quadrupede, and very little re&s;embling a creature endowed with
            life and motion. Whenever the Indians take it, which is in this form, by laying
            it clo&s;e to the <PB N="129" REF="175"> fire, they &s;oon oblige the poor
            animal to unfold it&s;elf, and to face a milder death to e&s;cape a more
            &s;evere.</P>
<P>This animal is a native only of America, for they were utterly
            unknown before the di&s;covery of that continent. It is an inoffen|&s;ive
            harmle&s;s creature, unle&s;s it finds the way into a garden, where it does a
            great deal of mi&s;chief, by eating the melons, the potatoes, and other
            vegetables. Although a native of the warme&s;t parts of America, yet it bears
            the cold of our climate without any inconvenience. We have often &s;een them
            &s;hewn among other wild bea&s;ts, which is a &s;ign they are not dif|ficult to
            be brought over. Their motion &s;eems to be a &s;wift walk, but they can
            neither run, leap, nor climb trees; &s;o that, if found in an open place, they
            have no method of e&s;caping from their pur&s;uers. Their only re&s;ource in
            &s;uch an extremity is to make towards their hole as fa&s;t as they can; or, if
            this be impracticable, to make a new hole before the enemy arrives. For this
            they require but a very few moments advantage; for the mole it&s;elf does not
            burrow &s;wifter than they can. For this purpo&s;e, they are furni&s;hed with
            claws extremely large, &s;trong, and crooked, and u&s;ually four upon each
            foot. They are &s;ometimes caught by the tail as they <PB N="130" REF="176">
            are making their way into the earth; but &s;uch is their re&s;i&s;tance, and
            &s;o difficult it is to draw them backward, that they leave their tail in the
            hand of their pur&s;uer, and are very well contented to &s;ave their lives with
            its lo&s;s. The pur&s;uers, &s;en&s;ible of this, never drag the tail with all
            their force, but hold it while another digs the ground about them, and thus
            the&s;e animals are taken alive. The in&s;tant the arma|dillo perceives
            it&s;elf in the power of its enemies, it has but one la&s;t re&s;ource, to roll
            it&s;elf up, and thus patiently wait whatever tortures they think proper to
            inflict. The fle&s;h of the &s;maller kinds is &s;aid to be delicate eating;
            &s;o that we may &s;uppo&s;e they receive no mercy. For this rea&s;on, they are
            pur&s;ued with un|cea&s;ing indu&s;try; and, although they burrow very deep in
            the earth, there have been many expedients u&s;ed to force them out. The
            hunters &s;ometimes contrive to fill the hole with &s;moke, which is often
            &s;ucce&s;sful; they at other times force it by pouring in water. They al&s;o
            bring up a &s;mall kind of dogs to the chace that quickly overtake them, if at
            any di&s;tance from their bur|row, and oblige them to roll them&s;elves up in a
            ball, in which figure the hunters carry them home. If, however, the armadillo
            be near a precipice, it often e&s;capes by rolling it&s;elf up, 
            <PB N="131" REF="177"> and then tumbling down from rock to rock, without the
            lea&s;t danger or inconvenience. They are &s;ometimes taken in &s;nares laid
            for them by the &s;ides of rivers and low moi&s;t places, which they
            particularly frequent; and this me|thod, in general, &s;ucceeds better than any
            of the former, as their burrows are very deep, and they &s;eldom &s;tir out
            except in the night. At no time are they found at any great di&s;tance from
            their retreats, &s;o that it requires &s;ome patience and &s;kill to intercept
            their retreat.</P>
<P>There are &s;carce any of the&s;e that do not root the ground,
            like an hog, in &s;earch of &s;uch roots as make a principal part of their
            food. They live al&s;o upon melons and other &s;ucculent ve|getables, and all
            will eat fle&s;h when they can get it. They frequent water and watery places,
            where they feed upon worms, &s;mall fi&s;h, and water in&s;ects. It is
            pretended that there is a kind of friend&s;hip between them and the
            rattle-&s;nake, that they live peaceably and commo|diou&s;ly together, and are
            frequently found in the &s;ame hole. This, however, may be a friend|&s;hip of
            nece&s;&s;ity to the armadillo; the rattle-&s;nake takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
            its retreats, which neither are willing to quit while each is inca|pable of
            injuring the other.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, the&s;e animals, though they 
            <PB N="132" REF="178"> all re&s;emble each other in the general character of
            being cloathed with a &s;hell, yet differ a good deal in their &s;ize, and in
            the parts into which their &s;hell is divided. The fir&s;t of this kind, which
            has but three bands between the two large pieces that cover the back, is called
            the Tatu Apara. I will not enter into an exact de|&s;cription of its figure,
            which, how well written &s;oever, no imagination could exactly conceive; and
            the reader would be more fatigued to un|der&s;tand than I to write it. The tail
            is &s;horter in this than any other kind, being not more than two inches long,
            while the &s;hell, taking all the pieces together, is a foot long and eight
            inches broad. The &s;econd is the Tatou of Ray, or the Encoubert of Buffon;
            this is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by &s;ix bands acro&s;s the back; it
            is about the &s;ize of a pig of a month old, with a &s;mall long head and a
            very long tail. The third is the Tatuette, furni&s;hed with eight bands, and
            not by a great deal &s;o big as the former. Its tail is longer al&s;o, and its
            legs &s;horter in pro|portion. Its body, from the no&s;e to the in&s;er|tion of
            the tail, is about ten inches long, and the tail &s;even. The fourth is the
            Pig-headed Armadillo, with nine bands. This is much larger than the former,
            being about two foot long from the no&s;e to the tail. The fifth is the 
            <PB N="133" REF="179"> Kaba&s;&s;ou, or Cataphractus, with twelve bands, and
            &s;till bigger than the former, or any other of its kind. This is often found
            above three feet long, but is never eaten as the re&s;t are. The &s;ixth is the
            Wea&s;el-headed Armadillo, with eighteen bands, with a large piece before, and
            nothing but bands backward. This is above a foot long, and the tail five
            inches. Of all the&s;e, the Kabba&s;&s;ou and the Encoubert are the large&s;t;
            the re&s;t are of a much &s;maller kind. In the larger kinds, the &s;hell is
            much more &s;olid than in the others, and the fle&s;h is much harder and unfit
            for the table. The&s;e are generally &s;een to re&s;ide in dry upland grounds,
            while the &s;mall &s;pecies are always found in moi&s;t places, and in the
            neighbourhood of brooks and rivers. They all roll them&s;elves into a ball; but
            tho&s;e who&s;e bands are fewe&s;t in number are lea&s;t capable of covering
            them&s;elves up completely. The Tatu Apara, for in&s;tance, when rolled up,
            pre&s;ents two great inter&s;tices between its bands, by which it is very
            ea&s;ily vulnerable, even by the feeble&s;t of quadrupedes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Animals of the Bat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the la&s;t chapter de&s;cribed a race of animals that
          unite the boundaries be|tween quadrupedes and in&s;ects, I come in this to a
          very different cla&s;s, that &s;erve to fill up the cha&s;m between quadrupedes
          and birds. Some naturali&s;ts, indeed, have found animals of the bat kind &s;o
          much partaking of the nature of both, that they have been at a lo&s;s in which
          rank to place them, and have doubted, in giving the hi&s;tory of the Bat,
          whether it was a bea&s;t or a bird they were de&s;cribing. The&s;e doubts,
          however, no longer exi&s;t; they are now univer&s;ally made to take their place
          among quadrupedes, to which their bringing forth their young alive, their hair,
          their teeth, as well as the re&s;t of their habi|tudes and conformation,
          evidently entitle them. Pliny, Ge&s;ner, and Aldrovandus, who placed them among
          birds, did not con&s;ider that they wanted every character of that order of
          animals, except the power of flying. Indeed, when this animal is &s;een with an
          aukward and &s;truggling motion, &s;upporting it&s;elf in the air at the du&s;k
          of the evening, it pre&s;ents in &s;ome mea&s;ure the <PB N="135" REF="181">
          appearance of a bird; but naturali&s;ts, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to examine
          it more clo&s;ely, to watch its habitudes, and in&s;pect into its forma|tion,
          are inexcu&s;able for concurring in the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The bat in &s;carce any particular re&s;embles the bird, except in
          its power of &s;u&s;taining it&s;elf in the air. It brings forth its young
          alive; it &s;uckles them; its mouth is furni&s;hed with teeth; its lungs are
          formed like tho&s;e of qua|drupedes; its inte&s;tines, and its &s;keleton, have
          a complete re&s;emblance, and even are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;een to
          re&s;emble tho&s;e of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Penis
            Propendens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bat mo&s;t common in England, is about the &s;ize of a mou&s;e;
          or nearly two inches and an half long. The membranes that are u&s;ually called
          wings, are, properly &s;peaking, an ex|ten&s;ion of the &s;kin all round the
          body, except the head, which, when the animal flies, is kept &s;tretched on
          every &s;ide, by the four interior toes of the fore feet, which are
          enormou&s;ly long, and &s;erve like ma&s;ts that keep the can|va&s;s of a
          &s;ail &s;pread, and regulate its motions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. The fir&s;t toe is quite
          loo&s;e, and &s;erves as a heel when the bat walks, or as an hook, when it
          would adhere to any thing. The hind feet are di&s;engaged from the
          &s;urrounding &s;kin, <PB N="136" REF="182"> and divided into five toes,
          &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling tho&s;e of a mou&s;e. The &s;kin by which it flies is
          of a du&s;ky colour. The body is covered with a &s;hort fur, of a mou&s;e
          colour, tinged with red. The eyes are very &s;mall; the ears like tho&s;e of a
          mou&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of the bat is very common in England. It makes its
          fir&s;t appearance early in &s;ummer, and begins its flight in the du&s;k of
          the evening. It principally frequents the &s;ides of woods, glades, and &s;hady
          walks; and is frequently ob&s;erved to &s;kim along the &s;urface of pieces of
          water. It pur&s;ues gnats, moths, and nocturnal in&s;ects of every kind. It
          feeds upon the&s;e; but will not refu&s;e meat, wherever it can find it. Its
          flight is a laborious, irre|gular movement; and if it happens to be
          in|terrupted in its cour&s;e, it cannot readily pre|pare for a &s;econd
          elevation; &s;o that if it &s;trikes again&s;t any object, and falls to the
          ground, it is u&s;ually taken. It appears only in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant
          evenings, when its prey is generally abroad, and flies in pur&s;uit with its
          mouth open. At other times it continues in its re|treat; the chink of a ruined
          building, or the hollow of a tree. Thus this little animal, even in &s;ummer,
          &s;leeps the greate&s;t part of its time, never venturing out by day-light, nor
          in rainy <PB N="137" REF="183"> weather; never hunting in que&s;t of prey, but
          for a &s;mall part of the night, and then return|ing to its hole. But its
          &s;hort life is &s;till more abridged by continuing in a torpid &s;tate during
          the winter. At the approach of the cold &s;ea&s;on, the bat prepares for its
          &s;tate of lifele&s;s inactivity, and &s;eems rather to chu&s;e a place where
          it may continue &s;afe from interruption, than where it may be warmly or
          conveniently lodged. For this rea&s;on it is u&s;ually &s;een hanging by its
          hooked claws to the roofs of caves, regardle&s;s of the eternal damps that
          &s;urround it. The bat &s;eems the only animal that will venture to remain in
          the&s;e frightful &s;ubterranean abodes, where it continues in a torpid
          &s;tate, unaffected by every change of the weather. Such of this kind as are
          not provident enough to procure them&s;elves a deep retreat, where the cold and
          heat &s;eldom vary, are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to great inconveniences, for the
          weather often becomes &s;o mild in the mid&s;t of winter as to warm them
          prematurely into life, and to allure them from their holes in que&s;t of food,
          when Nature has not provided a &s;upply. The&s;e, therefore, have &s;eldom
          &s;trength to return; but, having exhau&s;ted them&s;elves in a vain pur&s;uit,
          after in&s;ects which are not to be found, are de&s;troyed by the owl, or any
          other animal that follows &s;uch petty prey.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="184">The bat couples and brings forth in &s;ummer,
          generally from two to five at a time: of this I am certain, that I have found
          five young ones in a hole together; but whether they were the i&s;&s;ue of one
          parent, I cannot tell. The female has but two nipples, and tho&s;e forward on
          the brea&s;t, as in the human kind. This was a &s;uf|ficient motive for
          Linnaeus to give it the title of a Primas, to rank it in the &s;ame order with
          mankind; and to pu&s;h this contemptible animal among the chiefs of the
          creation. Such ar|bitrary a&s;&s;ociations produce rather ridicule than
          in&s;truction, and render even method contemp|tible: however, we are to forgive
          too &s;trong an attachment to &s;y&s;tem in this able naturali&s;t, &s;ince his
          application to the particular hi&s;tory of the animal, counterbalances the
          defect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fauna Succica. p. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Linnaeus we learn, that the female makes no ne&s;t for her
          young, as mo&s;t birds and quadru|pedes are known to do. She is barely content
          with the fir&s;t hole &s;he meets, where &s;ticking her|&s;elf by her hooks
          again&s;t the &s;ides of her apart|ment, &s;he permits her young to hang at the
          nipple, and in this manner to continue for the fir&s;t or &s;econd day. When,
          after &s;ome time, the dam begins to grow hungry, and finds a nece&s;&s;ity of
          &s;tirring abroad, &s;he takes her little <PB N="139" REF="185"> ones and
          &s;ticks them to the wall, in the manner &s;he before hung her&s;elf; there
          they immoveably cling, and patiently wait till her return.</P>
<P>Thus far this animal &s;eems clo&s;ely allied to the quadrupede
          race. Its &s;imilitude to that of birds is le&s;s &s;triking. As Nature has
          furni&s;hed birds with extremely &s;trong pectoral mu&s;cles, to move the
          wings, and direct their flight, &s;o has it al&s;o furni&s;hed this animal. As
          birds al&s;o have their legs weak, and unfit for the purpo&s;es of motion, the
          bat has its legs fa&s;hioned in the &s;ame manner, and is never &s;een to walk,
          or, more properly &s;peaking, to pu&s;h it&s;elf forward with its hind legs,
          but in ca&s;es of extreme ne|ce&s;&s;ity. The toes of the fore legs, or, if we
          may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, its extremely long fingers, extend the web like a
          membrane that lies between them; and this, which is ex|tremely thin, &s;erves
          to lift the little body into the air: in this manner, by an uncea&s;ing
          per|cu&s;&s;ion, much &s;wifter than that of birds, the animal continues, and
          directs its flight; how|ever, the great labour required in flying, &s;oon
          fatigues it; for, unlike birds, which continue for days together upon the wing,
          the bat is tired in le&s;s than an hour, and then returns to its hole,
          &s;atisfied with its &s;upply, to enjoy the darkne&s;s of its retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="186">If we con&s;ider the bat as it is &s;een in
          our own country, we &s;hall find it an harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive creature. It
          is true that it now and then &s;teals into a larder, and, like a mou&s;e,
          commits its petty thefts upon the fatte&s;t parts of the bacon. But this
          happens &s;eldom; the general tenor of its indu&s;try is employed in pur&s;uing
          in&s;ects that are much more noxious to us than it&s;elf can po&s;&s;ibly be;
          while its evening flight, and its un&s;teady wabbling motion, amu&s;e the
          ima|gination, and add one figure more to the plea&s;ing groupe of animated
          nature.</P>
<P>The varieties of this animal, e&s;pecially in our country, are but
          few; and the differences &s;carce worth enumeration. Naturali&s;ts mention the
          Long ear'd Bat, much le&s;s than that generally &s;een, and with much longer
          ears; the Hor&s;e &s;hoe Bat, with an odd protuberance round its upper lip,
          &s;omewhat in the form of an hor&s;e-&s;hoe; the Rhinoceros Bat, with an horn
          growing from the no&s;e, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that animal from whence it has
          the name. The&s;e, with &s;everal others, who&s;e varieties are too numerous,
          and differences too minute for a detail, are all in|offen&s;ive, minute, and
          contemptible; incapable, from their &s;ize, of injuring mankind, and not
          &s;ufficiently numerous much to incommode him. But there is a larger race of
          bats, found in the <PB N="141" REF="187"> Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, that are
          truly for|midable; each of the&s;e is &s;ingly a dangerous enemy; but when they
          unite in flocks, they then become dreadful. Were the inhabitants of the African
          coa&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Des Marchais, vol. ii. p.

          they do in the Ea&s;t-Indies, they would never want a &s;upply of provi&s;ions.
          They are there in &s;uch numbers, that, when they fly, they ob&s;cure the
          &s;etting &s;un. In the morning, at peep of day, they are &s;een &s;ticking
          upon the tops of the trees, and clinging to each other, like bees when they
          &s;warm, or like large clu&s;ters of coco. The Europeans often amu&s;e
          them&s;elves with &s;hoot|ing among this huge ma&s;s of living crea|tures, and
          ob&s;erving their embarra&s;&s;ment when wounded. They &s;ometimes enter the
          hou&s;es, and the Negroes are expert at killing them; but although the&s;e
          people &s;eem for ever hungry, yet they regard the bat with horror, and will
          not eat it, though ready to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>Of foreign bats, the large&s;t we have any cer|tain accounts of, is
          the Rou&s;ette, or the Great Bat of Madaga&s;car. This formidable creature is
          near four feet broad, when the wings are ex|tended; and a foot long, from the
          tip of the <PB N="142" REF="188"> no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail. It
          re&s;embles our bat in the form of its wings, in its manner of flying, and in
          its internal conformation. It differs from it in its enormous &s;ize; in its
          colour, which is red, like that of a fox; in its head and no&s;e al&s;o, which
          re&s;emble tho&s;e of that animal, and which have induced &s;ome to call it the
          flying fox: it differs al&s;o in the number of its teeth; and in having a claw
          on the fore foot, which is wanting in ours. This formidable creature is found
          only in the ancient continent; particularly in Madaga&s;car, along the coa&s;ts
          of Africa and Malabar, where it is u&s;ually &s;een about the &s;ize of a large
          hen. When they re|po&s;e, they &s;tick them&s;elves to the tops of the
          talle&s;t trees, and hang with their heads down|ward. But when they are in
          motion, nothing can be more formidable: they are &s;een in clouds, darkening
          the air, as well by day as by night, de&s;troying the ripe fruits of the
          country, and &s;ometimes &s;ettling upon animals, and man him&s;elf: they
          devour, indi&s;criminately, fruits, fle&s;h, and in&s;ects, and drink the juice
          of the palm-tree: they are heard at night in the fore&s;ts at more than two
          miles di&s;tance, with an hor|rible din; but at the approach of day, they
          u&s;ually begin to retire: nothing is &s;afe from <PB REF="189">

          rhinoceros bat; and its ears are extremely long. The other kinds generally
          re&s;ort to the fore&s;t, and the mo&s;t de&s;erted places; but the&s;e come
          into towns and cities, and, after &s;un-&s;et, when they begin to fly, cover

          <Q REND="inline">"They are," &s;ays Ulloa, "the mo&s;t expert
            blood-letters in the world. The inhabitants of tho&s;e warm lati|tudes being

            it. There they continue to &s;uck the blood; and it often happens that the
            per&s;on dies under the opera|tion. They in&s;inuate their tooth into a vein,
            with all the art of the mo&s;t experienced &s;urgeon, continuing to exhau&s;t
            the body, until they are &s;atiated. I have been a&s;&s;ured," continues he,
            "by per&s;ons of the &s;tricte&s;t veracity, that &s;uch an accident has
            happened to them; and that, had they not providentially awaked, their &s;leep
            would have been their pa&s;&s;age into eter|nity; having lo&s;t &s;o large a
            quantity of blood as hardly to find &s;trength to bind up the ori|fice. The
            rea&s;on why the puncture is not felt is, be&s;ides the great precaution with
            which it is made, the gentle refre&s;hing agitation of the bat's wings, which
            contribute to encrea&s;e &s;leep, and &s;often the pain."</Q></P>
<P>The purport of this account has been con|firmed by various other
          travellers; who all agree that this bat is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a faculty of
          drawing the blood from per&s;ons &s;leeping; and thus often de&s;troying them
          before they awake. But &s;till a very &s;trong difficulty re|mains 
          <PB N="145" REF="194"> to be accounted for; the manner in which they inflict
          the wound. Ulloa, as has been &s;een, &s;uppo&s;es that it is done by a
          &s;ingle tooth; but this we know to be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince the animal
          cannot infix one tooth without all the re&s;t accompanying its motions; the
          teeth of the bat kind being pretty even, and the mouth but &s;mall. Mr. Buffon
          therefore &s;uppo&s;es the wound to be inflicted by the tongue; which, however,
          appears to me too large to inflict an unpainful wound; and even le&s;s
          qualified for that purpo&s;e than the teeth. Nor can the tongue, as Mr. Buffon
          &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;erve for the purpo&s;es of &s;uction, &s;ince for
          this it mu&s;t be hollow, like a &s;yringe, which it is not found to be. I
          &s;hould therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that the animal is endowed with a &s;trong
          power of &s;uction; and that, without inflicting any wound what&s;oever, by
          continuing to draw, it enlarges the pores of the &s;kin in &s;uch a manner that
          the blood at length pa&s;&s;es, and that more freely the longer the operation
          is continued; &s;o that, at la&s;t, when the bat goes off, the blood con|tinues
          to flow. In confirmation of this opinion we are told, that where bea&s;ts have
          a thick &s;kin, this animal cannot injure them; whereas, in hor&s;es, mules,
          and a&s;&s;es, they are very liable <PB N="146" REF="195"> to be thus
          de&s;troyed. As to the re&s;t, the&s;e animals are con&s;idered as one of the
          great pe&s;ts of South America; and often prevent the peopling of many parts of
          that continent: having de&s;troyed at Barja, and &s;everal other places, &s;uch
          cattle as were brought there by the mi&s;&s;ionaries, in order to form a

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Amphibious Quadrupedes.</HEAD>
<P>THE gradations of Nature from one cla&s;s of beings to another are
          made by imperceptible devi|ations. As we &s;aw in the foregoing chapters
          qua|drupedes almo&s;t degraded into the in&s;ect tribe, or mounted among the
          inhabitants of the air, we are at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve their approach to
          fi&s;hes, to trace the degrees by which they become more unlike terre&s;trial
          animals, till the &s;imilitude of the fi&s;h prevails over that of the
          quadrupede.</P>
<P>As in oppo&s;ite armies the two bodies are di|&s;tinct and
          &s;eparated from each other, while yet between them are various troops that
          plunder on both &s;ides and are friends to neither, &s;o be|tween terre&s;trial
          and aquatic animals there are tribes that can &s;carce be referred to any rank,
          but lead an amphibious life between them. Sometimes in water, &s;ometimes on
          land, they &s;eem fitted for each element, and yet completely adapted to
          neither. Wanting the agility of quadrupedes upon land, and the per&s;everance
          of fi&s;hes in the deep, the variety of their powers only &s;eems to dimini&s;h
          their force; and, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two different methods of living, 
          <PB N="148" REF="197"> they are more inconveniently provided than &s;uch as
          have but one.</P>
<P>All quadrupedes of this kind, though co|vered with hair in the
          u&s;ual manner, are fur|ni&s;hed with membranes between the toes, which
          a&s;&s;i&s;t their motion in the water. Their paws are broad and their legs
          &s;hort, by which they are more completely fitted for &s;wimming, for taking
          &s;hort &s;trokes at a time they make them oftner and with greater rapidity.
          Some, how|ever, of the&s;e animals are more adapted to live in the water than
          others; but, as their power encrea&s;es to live in the deep, their unfitne&s;s
          for living upon land encrea&s;es in the &s;ame propor|tion. Some, like the
          otter, re&s;emble quadrupedes in every thing except in being in &s;ome
          mea&s;ure web-footed; others depart &s;till further, in being, like the beaver,
          not only web-footed, but hav|ing the tail covered with &s;cales, like tho&s;e
          of a fi&s;h. Others depart yet farther, as the &s;eal and the mor&s;e, by
          having the hind feet &s;tuck to the body like fins; and others, as the
          lamentin, almo&s;t entirely re&s;emble fi&s;hes, by having no hind feet
          what&s;oever. Such are the gradations of the amphibious tribe. They all,
          however, get their living in the water, either by habit or conformation; they
          all continue a long time under water; they all con&s;ider that element as 
          <PB N="149" REF="198"> their proper abode; whenever pre&s;t by danger, they fly
          to the water for &s;ecurity; and, when upon land, appear watchful, timorous,
          and un|wieldy.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tep of the progre&s;&s;ion from land to amphibious
          animals, we find the Otter, re|&s;embling tho&s;e of the terre&s;trial kind in
          &s;hape, hair, and internal conformation; re&s;embling the aquatic tribes in
          its manner of living, and in having membranes between the toes to a&s;&s;i&s;t
          it in &s;wimming. From this peculiar make of its feet, which are very &s;hort,
          it &s;wims even fa&s;ter than it runs, and can overtake fi&s;hes in their own
          element. The colour of this animal is brown; and it is &s;omewhat of the
          &s;hape of an overgrown wea&s;el, being long, &s;lender, and &s;oft &s;kinned.
          However, if we examine its figure in detail, we &s;hall find it unlike any
          other animal hitherto de&s;cribed, and of &s;uch a &s;hape as words can but
          weakly convey. Its u&s;ual length is about two feet long, from the tip of the
          no&s;e to the in|&s;ertion of the tail; the head and no&s;e are broad and flat;
          the mouth bears &s;ome &s;imilitude to that of a fi&s;h; the neck is &s;hort,
          and equal in thickne&s;s to the head; the body long; the tail broad at the
          in&s;ertion, but tapering off to a point at the end; the eyes are very &s;mall,
          and placed nearer the no&s;e than u&s;ual in quadru|pedes. 
          <PB N="150" REF="199"> The legs are very &s;hort, but remarkably &s;trong,
          broad, and mu&s;cular. The joints are articulated &s;o loo&s;ely, that the
          animal is capable of turning them quite back, and bringing them on a line with
          the body, &s;o as to perform the office of fins. Each foot is furni&s;hed with
          five toes, connected by &s;trong broad webs like tho&s;e of water fowl. Thus
          Nature, in every part, has had attention to the life of an animal who&s;e food
          is fi&s;h, and who&s;e haunts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be about water.</P>
<P>This voracious animal is never found but at the &s;ides of lakes and
          rivers, but particularly the former, for it is &s;eldom fond of fi&s;hing in a
          running &s;tream, for the current of the water having more power upon it than
          the fi&s;hes it pur&s;ues, if it hunts again&s;t the &s;tream it &s;wims too
          &s;low; and if with the &s;tream, it over&s;hoots its prey. However, when in
          rivers, it is always ob&s;erved to &s;wim again&s;t the &s;tream, and to meet
          the fi&s;hes it preys upon rather than to pur&s;ue them. In lakes it de&s;troys
          much more than it de|vours, and is often &s;een to &s;poil a pond in the
          &s;pace of a few nights. But the damage they do by de&s;troying fi&s;h is not
          &s;o great as their tearing in pieces the nets of the fi&s;hers, which they
          infal|libly do whenever they happen to be entangled. The in&s;tant they find
          them&s;elves caught, they <PB REF="200">

          con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>The otter has two different methods of fi&s;hing; the one by
          catching its prey from the bottom upward, the other by pur&s;uing it into
          &s;ome little creek and &s;eizing it there. In the former ca&s;e, as this
          animal has longer lungs than mo&s;t other quadrupedes, upon taking in a
          quantity of air, it can remain for &s;ome minutes at the bottom; and whatever
          fi&s;h pa&s;&s;es over at that time is certainly taken; for, as the eyes of
          fi&s;h are placed &s;o as not to &s;ee under them, the otter attacks them off
          their guard from be|low; and, &s;eizing them at once by the belly, drags them
          on &s;hore, where it often leaves them untouched, to continue the pur&s;uit for
          hours together. The other method is chiefly practi&s;ed in lakes and ponds,
          where there is no current; the fi&s;h thus taken are rather of the &s;maller
          kind, for the great ones will never be driven out of deep water.</P>
<P>In this manner the otter u&s;ually lives during the &s;ummer, being
          furni&s;hed with a &s;upply much greater than its con&s;umption; killing for
          its amu&s;ement, and infecting the edges of the lake with quantities of dead
          fi&s;h, which it leaves there as trophies rather of its victory than its
          nece&s;&s;ities. But in winter, when the lakes are <PB N="152" REF="204">
          frozen over, and the rivers pour with a rapid torrent, the otter is often
          greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions; and is then obliged to live upon
          gra&s;s, weeds, and even the bark of trees. It then comes upon land, and, grown
          courageous from nece&s;&s;ity, feeds upon terre&s;trial animals, rats,
          in&s;ects, and even &s;heep them&s;elves. Na|ture, however, has given it the
          power of con|tinuing a long time without food; and, although during that
          &s;ea&s;on it is not rendered quite tor|pid, like the marmout or the
          dormou&s;e, yet it keeps much more within its retreat, which is u&s;ually the
          hollow of a bank worn under by the water. There it often forms a kind of
          gal|lery, running for &s;everal yards along the edge of the water; &s;o that
          when attacked at one end, it flies to the other, and often evades the fowler by
          plunging into the water at forty or fifty paces di&s;tance, while he expects to
          find it ju&s;t before him.</P>
<P>We learn from Mr. Buffon that this animal, in France, couples in
          winter and brings forth in the beginning of &s;pring. But it is certainly
          different with us, for its young are never found till the latter end of
          &s;ummer; and I have fre|quently, when a boy, di&s;covered their retreats, and
          pur&s;ued them at that &s;ea&s;on. I am, there|fore, more inclined to follow
          the account given <PB N="153" REF="205"> us of this animal by Mr. Lots, of the
          Academy of Stockholm, who a&s;&s;ures us that it couples about the middle of
          &s;ummer, and brings forth, at the end of nine weeks, generally three or four
          at a time. This, as well as the generality of his other remarks on this
          &s;ubject, agrees &s;o ex|actly with what I remember concerning it, that I will
          beg leave to take him for my guide, a&s;|&s;uring the reader that, however
          extraordinary the account may &s;eem, I know it to be certainly true.</P>
<P>In the rivers and the lakes frequented by the otter, the bottom is
          generally &s;tony and uneven, with many trunks of trees, and long roots
          &s;tretching underneath the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Journal
              Etranger, Juin. 1755, p. 14.</BIBL></NOTE>. The &s;hore al&s;o is hollow and
          &s;cooped inward by the waves. The&s;e are the places the otter chiefly
          chu&s;es for its retreat; and there is &s;carce a &s;tone which does not bear
          the mark of its re&s;idence, as upon them its excrements are always made. It is
          chiefly by this mark that its lurking places are known, as well as by the
          quantity of dead fi&s;h that are found lying here and there upon the banks of
          the water. To take the old ones alive is no ea&s;y ta&s;k, as they are
          extremely &s;trong, and there are few dogs that will dare to encounter them.
          They bite with great fierce|ne&s;s, <PB N="154" REF="206"> and never let go
          their hold when they have once fa&s;tened. The be&s;t way, therefore, is to
          &s;hoot them at once, as they never will be thoroughly tamed; and, if kept for
          the purpo&s;es of fi&s;hing, are always apt to take the fir&s;t opportunity of
          e&s;caping. But the young ones may be more ea&s;ily taken, and con|verted to
          very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The otter brings forth its young generally under the
          hol|low banks, upon a bed of ru&s;hes, flags, or &s;uch weeds as the place
          affords it in greate&s;t quan|tities. I &s;ee in the Briti&s;h Zoology a
          de&s;cription of its habitation, where that naturali&s;t ob&s;erves, 
          <Q REND="inline">"that it burrows under ground, on the banks of
            &s;ome river or lake, and always makes the entrance of its hole under water,
            then works up to the &s;urface of the earth, and there makes a minute orifice
            for the admi&s;&s;ion of air; and this little air-hole is often found in the
            middle of &s;ome thicket."</Q> In &s;ome places this may be true, but I have
          never ob&s;erved any &s;uch con|trivance; the retreat, indeed, was always at
          the edge of the water, but it was only &s;heltered by the impending bank, and
          the otter it&s;elf &s;eemed to have but a &s;mall &s;hare in its formation.
          But, be this as it may, the young ones are always found at the edge of the
          water; and, if under the protection of the dam, &s;he teaches 
          <PB N="155" REF="207"> them in&s;tantly to plunge, like her&s;elf, into the
          deep, and e&s;cape among the ru&s;hes or weeds that fringe the &s;tream. At
          &s;uch times, there|fore, it is very difficult to take them; for, though never
          &s;o young they &s;wim with great rapidity, and in &s;uch a manner that no part
          of them is &s;een above water, except the tip of the no&s;e. It is only when
          the dam is ab&s;ent that they can be taken; and in &s;ome places there are dogs
          purpo&s;ely trained for di&s;covering their retreats. Whenever the dog comes to
          the place, he &s;oon, by his barking, &s;hews that the otter is there; which,
          if there be an old one, in&s;tantly plunges into the water, and the young all
          follow. But if the old one be ab&s;ent, they continue terrified, and will not
          venture forth but under her guidance and protection. In this manner they are
          &s;ecured and taken home alive, where they are carefully fed with &s;mall
          fi&s;h and water. In proportion, however, as they gather &s;trength, they have
          milk mixed among their food, the quantity of their fi&s;h provi&s;ion is
          retrenched, and that of vegetables is encrea&s;ed, until at length they are fed
          wholly upon bread, which perfectly agrees with their con&s;titution. The manner
          of training them up to hunt for fi&s;h requires not only a&s;&s;iduity but
          patience; however, their activity and u&s;e, when <PB N="156" REF="208">
          taught, greatly repays the trouble of teaching; and, perhaps, no other animal
          is more bene|ficial to its ma&s;ter. The u&s;ual way is, fir&s;t to learn them
          to fetch as dogs are in&s;tructed; but, as they have not the &s;ame docility,
          &s;o it requires more art and experience to teach them. It is u&s;ually
          performed by accu&s;toming them to take a tru&s;s &s;tuffed with wool, of the
          &s;hape of a fi&s;h, and made of leather, in their mouths, and to drop it at
          the word of command; to run after it when thrown forward, and to bring it to
          their ma&s;ter. From this they proceed to real fi&s;h, which are thrown dead
          into the water, and which they are taught to fetch from thence. From the dead
          they proceed to the live, until at la&s;t the animal is perfectly in&s;tructed
          in the whole art of fi&s;hing. An otter thus taught is a very valuable animal,
          and will catch fi&s;h enough to &s;u&s;tain not only it&s;elf but a whole
          family. I have &s;een one of the&s;e go to a gentleman's pond at the word of
          command, drive up the fi&s;h into a corner, and, &s;eizing up the large&s;t of
          the whole, bringing it off, in its mouth, to its ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Otters are to be met with in mo&s;t parts of the world, and rather
          differ in &s;ize and colour from each other, than in habitudes or

          America and Carolina <PB N="157" REF="210"> they are u&s;ually found white,

          roundi&s;h head, almo&s;t like a cat. The tail is &s;horter, being but five
          inches long; and the hair is &s;oft, &s;hort, and black, except on the head,
          where it is of a dark brown, with a yel|lowi&s;h &s;pot under the throat.</P>

            We from thence perceive to what a degree animals, with|out language or

            advantages which each, in a &s;tate of &s;olitude, &s;eems unfitted to
            po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>If we examine the beaver merely as an in|dividual, and unconnected
            with others of its kind, we &s;hall find many other quadrupedes to exceed it in
            cunning, and almo&s;t all in the powers of annoyance and defence. The beaver,
            when taken from its fellows, and kept in a &s;tate of &s;olitude or dome&s;tic
            tamene&s;s, appears to be a mild gentle creature, familiar enough, but
            &s;omewhat dull, and even melancholly; without any violent pa&s;&s;ions or
            vehement appetites, moving but &s;eldom, making no efforts to attain any good,
            except in gnawing the wall of its pri&s;on, in order to regain its freedom; yet
            this, however, without anger or precipitation, but calm and indifferent to all
            about, without at|tachment or antipathies, neither &s;eeking to of|fend nor
            de&s;iring to plea&s;e. It appears inferior to the dog in tho&s;e qualities
            which render ani|mals of &s;ervice to man; it &s;eems made neither to &s;erve,
            to command, or to have connections <PB N="159" REF="214"> with any other &s;et
            of beings, and is only adapted for living among its kind. Its talents are
            en|tirely repre&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude, and are only brought out by &s;ociety.
            When alone, it has but little indu&s;try, few tricks, and without cunning
            &s;uf|ficient to guard it again&s;t the mo&s;t obvious and bungling &s;nares
            laid for it by the hunter. Far from attacking any other animal, it is &s;carce
            po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the arts of defence. Preferring flight to combat, like all
            wild animals, it only re&s;i&s;ts when driven to an extremity, and fights only
            then when its &s;peed can no longer avail.</P>
<P>But this animal is rather more remarkable for the &s;ingularity of
            its conformation than any intellectual &s;uperiorities it may be &s;uppo&s;ed,
            in a &s;tate of &s;olitude, to po&s;&s;e&s;s. The beaver is the only creature
            among quadrupedes that has a flat broad tail, covered with &s;cales, which
            &s;erves as a rudder to direct its motions in the water. Is is the &s;ole
            quadrupede that has mem|branes between the toes on the hind feet only, and none
            on the fore feet, which &s;upply the place of hands, as in the &s;quirrel. In
            &s;hort, it is the only animal that in its fore parts entirely re&s;embles a
            quadrupede, and in its hinder parts &s;eems to approach the nature of fi&s;hes,
            by hav|ing a &s;caly tail. In other re&s;pects, it is about two feet long and
            near one foot high; it is <PB N="160" REF="215"> &s;omewhat &s;haped like a
            rat, except the tail, which, as has been ob&s;erved, is flat and &s;caly,
            &s;omewhat re&s;embling a neat's tongue at the point. Its colour is of a light
            brown; the hair of two &s;orts; the one longer and coar&s;er; the other,
            &s;oft, fine, &s;hort, and &s;ilky. The teeth are like tho&s;e of a rat or a
            &s;quirrel, but longer and &s;tronger, and admirably adapted to cutting timber
            or &s;tripping bark, to which purpo&s;es they are con&s;tantly applied. One
            &s;ingularity more may be mentioned in its conformation; which is, that, like
            birds, it has but one and the &s;ame vent for the emi&s;&s;ion of its
            excrements and its urine; a &s;trange peculiarity, but which, anatomi&s;ts
            leave us no room to doubt of.</P>
<P>The beavers begin to a&s;&s;emble about the months of June and
            July, to form a &s;ociety that is to continue for the greate&s;t part of the
            year. They arrive in numbers from every &s;ide, and generally form a company of
            above two hundred. The place of meeting is commonly the place where they &s;ix
            their abode, and this is always by the &s;ide of &s;ome lake or river. If it be
            a lake in which the waters are always upon a level, they di&s;pen&s;e with
            building a dam; but if it be a running &s;tream, which is &s;ubject to floods
            and falls, they then &s;et about building a dam, or pier, that cro&s;&s;es the
            river, &s;o that it <PB N="161" REF="216"> forms a dead water in that part
            which lies above and below. This dam, or pier, is often four|&s;core or an
            hundred feet long, and ten or twelve feet thick at the ba&s;e. If we compare
            the great|ne&s;s of the work with the powers of the architect, it will appear
            enormous; but the &s;olidity with which it is built is &s;till more
            a&s;toni&s;hing than its &s;ize. The part of the river over which this dam is
            u&s;ually built, is where it is mo&s;t &s;hallow, and where &s;ome great tree
            is found growing by the &s;ide of the &s;tream. This they pitch upon as proper
            for making the principal part in their building; and, although it is often
            thicker than a man's body, they in&s;tantly &s;et about cutting it down. For

<P>This dike, or cau&s;ey, is &s;ometimes ten, and &s;ometimes twelve
            feet thick at the foundation. It de&s;cends in a declivity or &s;lope, on that
            &s;ide next the water, which gravitates upon the work in proportion to the
            height, and pre&s;&s;es it with a prodigious force towards the earth. The 
            <PB N="162" REF="217"> oppo&s;ite &s;ide is erected perpendicular, like our
            walls; and that declivity, which, at the bottom, or ba&s;is, is about twelve
            feet broad, dimini&s;hes towards the top, where it is no more than two feet
            broad, or thereabouts. The materials whereof this mole con&s;i&s;ts, are wood
            and clay. The beavers cut, with &s;uprizing ea&s;e, large pieces of wood,
            &s;ome as thick as one's arm or one's thigh, and about four, five or &s;ix feet
            in length, or &s;ometimes more, according as the &s;lope a&s;cends. They drive
            one end of the&s;e &s;takes into the ground, at a &s;mall di&s;tance one from
            the other, intermingling a few with them that are &s;maller and more pliant. As
            the water, however, would find a pa&s;&s;age through the in|tervals or &s;paces
            between them, and leave the re&s;ervoir dry, they have recour&s;e to a clay,
            which they know where to find, and with which they &s;top up all the cavities
            both within and without, &s;o that the water is duly confined. They continue to
            rai&s;e the dike in proportion to the elevation of the water and the plenty
            which they have of it. They are con&s;cious like|wi&s;e that the conveyance of
            their materials by land would not be &s;o ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed as by water;
            and therefore they take the advantage of its increa&s;e, and &s;wim with their
            mortar on their tails, and their &s;takes between their teeth, to the places
            where there is mo&s;t occa&s;ion for <PB N="163" REF="218"> them. If their
            works are, either by the force of the water or the feet of the hunt&s;men, who
            run over them, in the lea&s;t damnified, the breach is in&s;tantly made up;
            every nook and corner of the habitation is reviewed, and, with the ut|mo&s;t
            diligence and application, perfectly re|paired. But when they find the
            hunt&s;men vi&s;it them too often, they work only in the night-time, or el&s;e
            abandon their works entirely, and &s;eek out for &s;ome &s;afer
            &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The dike, or mole, being thus completed, their next care is to
            erect their &s;everal apart|ments, which are either round or oval, and di|vided
            into three &s;tories, one rai&s;ed above the other: the fir&s;t below the level
            of the cau&s;ey, which is for the mo&s;t part full of water; the other two
            above it. This little fabrick is built in a very firm and &s;ub&s;tantial
            manner, on the edge of their re&s;ervoir, and always in &s;uch di|vi&s;ions or
            apartments as above-mentioned; that in ca&s;e of the water's increa&s;e, they
            may move up a &s;tory higher, and be no ways incommoded. If they find any
            little i&s;land contiguous to their re&s;ervoir, they fix their man&s;ion
            there, which is then more &s;olid, and not &s;o frequently ex|po&s;ed to the
            overflowing of the water, in which they are not able to continue for any length
            of time. In ca&s;e they cannot pitch upon &s;o com|modious 
            <PB N="164" REF="219"> a &s;ituation, they drive piles into the earth, in order
            to fence and fortify their habi|tation again&s;t the wind as well as the water.
            They make two apertures, at the bottom, to the &s;tream; one is a pa&s;&s;age
            to their bagnio, which they always keep neat and clean; the other leads to that
            part of the building where every thing is conveyed, that will either &s;oil or
            damage their upper apartments. They have a third opening or door-way, much
            higher, con|trived for the prevention of their being &s;hut up and confined,
            when the fro&s;t and &s;now has clo&s;ed the apertures of the lower floors.
            Some|times they build their hou&s;es altogether upon dry land; but then they
            &s;ink trenches five or &s;ix feet deep, in order to de&s;cend into the water
            when they &s;ee convenient. They make u&s;e of the &s;ame materials; and are
            equally indu&s;trious in the erection of their lodges, as their dikes. Their
            walls are perpendicular, and about two feet thick. As their teeth are more
            &s;ervice|able than &s;aws, they cut off all the wood that projects beyond the
            wall. After this, when they have mixed up &s;ome clay and dry gra&s;s together,
            they work it into a kind of mortar, with which, by the help of their tails,
            they plai&s;ter all their works, both within and with|out.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="220">The in&s;ide is vaulted, and is large enough
            for the reception of eight or ten beavers. In ca&s;e it ri&s;es in an oval
            figure, it is for the gene|rality above twelve feet long, and eight or ten feet
            broad. If the number of inhabitants in|crea&s;e to fifteen, twenty, or thirty,
            the edifice is enlarged in proportion. I have been cre|dibly informed, that
            four hundred beavers have been di&s;covered to re&s;ide in one large
            man&s;ion-hou&s;e, divided into a va&s;t number of apart|ments, that had a free
            communication one with another.</P>
<P>All the&s;e works, more e&s;pecially in the northern parts, are
            fini&s;hed in Augu&s;t, or Sep|tember at farthe&s;t; at which time they begin
            to lay in their &s;tores. During the &s;ummer, they are perfect epicures; and
            regale them&s;elves every day on the choice&s;t fruits and plants the country
            affords. Their provi&s;ions, indeed, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, principally
            con&s;i&s;t of the wood of the birch, the plane, and &s;ome few other trees,
            which they &s;teep in water, from time to time, in &s;uch quantities as are
            proportioned to the number of inhabitants. They cut down branches from three to
            ten feet in length. Tho&s;e of the large&s;t dimen&s;ions are conveyed to their
            magazines by a whole body of beavers; but the &s;malle&s;t by one only: each of
            them, <PB N="166" REF="221"> however, takes a different way, and has his proper
            walk a&s;&s;igned him, in order that no one labourer &s;hould interrupt another
            in the pro|&s;ecution of his work. Their wood-yards are larger or &s;maller, in
            proportion to the number in family: and, according to the ob&s;ervation of
            &s;ome curious naturali&s;ts, the u&s;ual &s;tock of timber, for the
            accommodation of ten beavers, con&s;i&s;ts of about thirty feet in a &s;quare
            &s;urface, and ten in depth. The&s;e logs are not thrown up in one continual
            pile, but laid one acro&s;s the other, with intervals, or &s;mall &s;paces
            be|tween them, in order to take out, with the greater facility, but ju&s;t
            &s;uch a quantity as they &s;hall want for their immediate con&s;umption, and
            tho&s;e parcels only, which lie at the bottom in the water, and have been duly
            &s;teeped. This timber is cut again into &s;mall particles, and conveyed to one
            of their large&s;t lodges, where the whole family meet, to con&s;ume their
            re&s;pective dividends, which are made impar|tially, in even and equal
            portions. Sometimes they traver&s;e the woods, and regale their young with a
            more novel and elegant entertainment.</P>
<P>Such as are u&s;ed to hunt the&s;e animals, know perfectly well,
            that green wood is much more acceptable to them, than that which is old and
            dry; for which rea&s;on they plant a con&s;iderable <PB N="167" REF="222">
            quantity of it round their lodgments; and as they come out to partake of it,
            they either catch them in &s;nares, or take them by &s;urprize. In the winter,
            when the fro&s;ts are very &s;evere, they &s;ometimes break a large hole in the
            ice; and when the beavers re&s;ort thither for the be|nefit of a little fre&s;h
            air, they either kill them with their hatchets, or cover the opening with a
            large &s;ub&s;tantial net. After this, they un|dermine and &s;ubvert the whole
            fabrick: where|upon the beavers, in hopes to make their e&s;cape in their
            u&s;ual way, fly with the utmo&s;t preci|pitation to the water; and plunging
            into the aperture, fall directly into the net, and are inevitably taken.</P>

<HEAD>THE SEAL.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY &s;tep we proceed in the de&s;cription of amphibious
            quadrupedes, we make nearer advances to the tribe of fi&s;hes. We fir&s;t
            ob|&s;erved the otter with its feet webbed, and formed for an aquatic life; we
            next &s;aw the beaver with the hinder parts covered with &s;cales, re&s;embling
            tho&s;e of fi&s;hes; and we now come to a cla&s;s of animals in which the
            &s;hape and habitude of fi&s;hes &s;till more apparently prevails, and who&s;e
            in|ternal conformation attaches them very clo&s;ely <PB N="168" REF="223"> to
            the water. The Seal, in general, re&s;embles a quadrupede in &s;ome re&s;pects,
            and a fi&s;h in others. The head is round, like that of a man; the no&s;e
            broad, like that of the otter; the teeth like tho&s;e of a dog; the eyes large
            and &s;park|ling; no external ears, but holes that &s;erve for that purpo&s;e;
            the neck is well proportioned, and of a moderate length; but the body
            thicke&s;t where the neck is joined to it. From thence the animal tapers down
            to the tail, growing all the way &s;maller, like a fi&s;h. The whole body is
            covered with a thick bri&s;tly &s;hining hair, which looks as if it were
            entirely rubbed over with oil; and thus far the quadrupede prevails over the
            aquatic. But it is in the feet that this ani|mal greatly differs from all the
            re&s;t of the qua|drupede kind; for, though furni&s;hed with the &s;ame number
            of bones with other quadrupedes, yet they are &s;o &s;tuck on the body, and
            &s;o covered with a membrane, that they more re&s;emble fins than feet; and
            might be taken for &s;uch, did not the claws with which they are pointed &s;hew
            their proper analogy. In the fore feet, or rather hands, all the arm and the
            cubit, are hid under the &s;kin, and nothing appears but the hand from the
            wri&s;t downwards; &s;o that if we imagine a child with its arms &s;wathed
            down, and nothing appearing but its hands at each &s;ide of the body, 
            <PB N="169" REF="224"> towards the brea&s;t, we may have &s;ome idea of the
            formation of this animal in that part. The&s;e hands are covered in a thick
            &s;kin, which &s;erves, like a fin, for &s;wimming; and are di&s;tingui&s;hed
            by five claws, which are long, black, and pierc|ing. As to the hind feet, they
            are &s;tretched out on each &s;ide of the &s;hort tail, covered with a hairy
            &s;kin like the former, and both together almo&s;t joining at the tail; the
            whole looks like the broad flat tail of a fi&s;h; and, were it not for five
            claws which appear, might be con&s;idered as &s;uch. The dimen&s;ions of this
            animal are va|rious, being found from four feet long to nine. They differ
            al&s;o in their colours; &s;ome being black, others &s;potted, &s;ome white,
            and many more yellow. It would, therefore, be almo&s;t endle&s;s to mention the
            varieties of this animal. Buffon de&s;cribes three; and Krantz mentions five,
            all different from tho&s;e de&s;cribed by the other. I might, were I fond of
            &s;uch honours, claim the merit of being a fir&s;t de&s;criber my&s;elf; but,
            in fact, the varieties in this animal are &s;o many, that, were they all
            de&s;cribed, the cata|logue would be as exten&s;ive as it would be u&s;e|le&s;s
            and unentertaining. It is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that they agree in the
            general external characters already mentioned, and internally in two or three
            more, which are &s;o remarkable as to de&s;erve peculiar attention.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="225">It has been often remarked that all animals
            are &s;agacious in proportion to the &s;ize of their brain. It has, in
            &s;upport of this opinion, been alledged that man, with re&s;pect to his bulk,
            has of all others the large&s;t. In pur&s;uance of this a&s;&s;umption, &s;ome
            erroneous &s;peculations have been formed. But, were the &s;ize of the brain to
            determine the quantity of the under|&s;tanding, the &s;eal would of all other
            animals be the mo&s;t &s;agacious; for it has, in proportion, the large&s;t
            brain of any, even man him&s;elf not excepted. However, this animal is
            po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but very few advantages over other quadru|pedes; and the
            &s;ize of its brain furni&s;hes it with few powers that contribute to its
            wi&s;dom or its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>This animal differs al&s;o in the formation of its tongue from all
            other quadrupedes. It is forked or &s;lit at the end like that of &s;erpents;
            but for what purpo&s;es it is thus &s;ingularly con|trived we are at a lo&s;s
            to know. We are much better informed with re&s;pect to a third &s;ingu|larity
            in its conformation, which is, that the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> in the heart is
            open. Tho&s;e who are in the lea&s;t acquainted with anatomy know, that the
            veins uniting bring their blood to the heart, which &s;ends it into the lungs,
            and from thence it returns to the heart again to be di|&s;tributed 
            <PB N="171" REF="226"> through the whole body. Animals, however, before they
            are born, make no u&s;e of their lungs; and therefore their blood, without
            entering their lungs, takes a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age through the very partition
            of the heart, from one of its chambers to the other, thus pa&s;&s;ing from the
            veins directly into tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els that drive it through the whole frame.
            But the moment the animal is brought forth, the pa&s;|&s;age through the
            partition, which pa&s;&s;age is called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> clo&s;es up
            and continues clo&s;ed for ever; for the blood then takes its longe&s;t
            cour&s;e through the lungs to return to the other chamber of the heart again.
            Now the &s;eal's heart re&s;embles that of an infant in the womb, for the
            <HI>foramen ovale</HI> never clo&s;es; and, although the blood of this animal
            com|monly circulates through the lungs, yet it can circulate without their
            a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as was ob|&s;erved above, by a &s;horter way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have followed the u&s;ual ob&s;ervations of naturali&s;ts
              with re&s;pect to the foramen ovale in this animal: I have many rea&s;ons,
              however, to incline me to think that the foramen is not entirely open. But this
              is not the place for a critical enquiry of this kind.</NOTE>. From hence,
            therefore, we &s;ee the manner in which this ani|mal is adapted for continuing
            under water; for, being under no immediate nece&s;&s;ity of breath|ing, 
            <PB N="172" REF="227"> the vital motions are &s;till carried on while it
            continues at the bottom; &s;o that it can pur&s;ue its prey in that element,
            and yet enjoy all the delights and advantages of ours.</P>
<P>The water is the &s;eal's u&s;ual habitation, and whatever fi&s;h
            it can catch its food. Though not equal in in&s;tinct and cunning to &s;ome
            ter|re&s;trial animals, it is greatly &s;uperior to the mute tenants of that
            element in which it chiefly re|&s;ides. Although it can continue for &s;everal
            minutes under water, yet it is not able, like fi&s;hes, to remain there for any
            length of time; and a &s;eal may be drowned like any other ter|re&s;trial
            animal. Thus it &s;eems &s;uperior in &s;ome re&s;pects to the inhabitants of
            both elements, and inferior in many more. Although furni&s;hed with legs, it is
            in &s;ome mea&s;ure deprived of all the advantages of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are &s;hut up within its body,
            while nothing appear but the extremities of them, and the&s;e furni&s;hed with
            very little motion, but to &s;erve them as fins in the water. The hind feet,
            indeed, being turned backwards, are entirely u&s;ele&s;s upon land; &s;o that
            when the animal is obliged to move, it drags it&s;elf forward like a reptile,
            and with an effort more painful. For this purpo&s;e it is obliged to u&s;e its
            fore feet, which, though very <PB N="173" REF="228"> &s;hort, &s;erve to give
            it &s;uch a degree of &s;wiftne&s;s that a man cannot readily overtake it; and
            it runs towards the &s;ea. As it is thus aukwardly formed for going upon land,
            it is &s;eldom found at any di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;hore, but continues to
            ba&s;k upon the rocks; and when di&s;turbed always plunges down at once to the
            bottom.</P>
<P>The &s;eal is a &s;ocial animal, and wherever it frequents numbers
            are generally &s;een together. They are found in every climate, but in the
            north and icy &s;eas they are particularly nume|rous. It is on tho&s;e
            &s;hores, which are le&s;s inha|bited than ours, and where the fi&s;h re&s;ort
            in greater abundance, that they are &s;een by thou|&s;ands, like flocks of
            &s;heep, ba&s;king on the rocks, and &s;uckling their young. There they keep
            watch like other gregarious animals; and, if an enemy appear, in&s;tantly
            plunge altogether into the water. In fine weather they more u&s;ually employ
            their time in fi&s;hing; and ge|nerally come on &s;hore in tempe&s;ts and
            &s;torms. The &s;eal &s;eems the only animal that takes de|light in the&s;e
            tremendous conflicts of nature. In the mid&s;t of thunders and torrents, when
            every other creature takes refuge from the fury of the elements, the &s;eals

            univer&s;al di&s;order. This, however, may ari&s;e <PB N="174" REF="229"> from
            the &s;ea being at that time too turbulent for them to re&s;ide in; and they
            may then par|ticularly come upon land when unable to re&s;i&s;t the &s;hock of
            their more u&s;ual element.</P>
<P>As &s;eals are gregarious, &s;o are they al&s;o ani|mals of
            pa&s;&s;age, and perhaps the only quadru|pedes that migrate from one part of
            the world to another. The generality of quadrupedes are contented with their
            native plains and fore&s;ts, and &s;eldom &s;tray except when nece&s;&s;ity or
            fear impels them. But &s;eals change their habita|tion; and are &s;een in
            va&s;t multitudes directing their cour&s;e from one continent to another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz, vol. i, p. 129.</BIBL></NOTE>. On the northern
            coa&s;ts of Greenland they are &s;een to retire in July, and to return again in
            September. This time it is &s;uppo&s;ed they go in pur&s;uit of food. But they
            make a &s;econd departure in March to ca&s;t their young, and return in the
            beginning of June, young and all, in a great body together, ob&s;erving in
            their route a certain fixed time and track, like birds of pa&s;&s;age. When
            they go upon this expedi|tion, they are &s;een in great droves, for many days
            together, making towards the north, tak|ing that part of the &s;ea mo&s;t free
            from ice, and going &s;till forward into tho&s;e &s;eas where man cannot
            follow. In what manner they return, <PB N="175" REF="230"> or by what
            pa&s;&s;ages, is utterly unknown; it is only ob&s;erved, that when they leave
            the coa&s;ts to go upon this expedition they are all ex|tremely fat, but on
            their return they come home exce&s;&s;ively lean.</P>
<P>The females in our climate bring forth in winter, and rear their
            young upon &s;ome &s;and-bank, rock, or de&s;olate i&s;land, at &s;ome
            di&s;tance from the con|tinent. When they &s;uckle their young they &s;it up on
            their hinder legs, while the&s;e, which are at fir&s;t white with woolly hair,
            cling to the tates, of which there are four in number, near the navel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
              <Q>Coeunt in Littore re&s;upinata femina. 
                <BIBL>LIN. SYST.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. In this manner the young
            continue in the place where they are brought forth, for twelve or fifteen days;
            after which the dam brings them down to the water, and accu&s;toms them to
            &s;wim and get their food by their own indu&s;try. As each litter never exceeds
            above three or four, &s;o the animal's cares are not much divided, and the
            education of her little ones is &s;oon compleated. In fact, the young are
            particularly docile; they under&s;tand the mother's voice among the numerous
            bleatings of the re&s;t of the old ones; they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other
            in danger, and are perfectly obedient to her call. Thus early accu&s;tomed to
            &s;ubjection, they continue to live in &s;ociety, <PB N="176" REF="231"> hunt
            and herd together, and have a variety of tones by which they encourage to
            pur&s;ue or warn each other of danger. Some compare their voices to the
            bleating of a flock of &s;heep, interrupted now and then by the barking of
            angry dogs, and &s;ometimes the &s;hriller notes of a cat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;t.</BIBL></NOTE>. All along the &s;hore, each
            has its own peculiar rock, of which it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and where it
            &s;leeps when fatigued with fi&s;hing, uninterrupted by any of the re&s;t. The
            only &s;ea&s;on when their &s;ocial &s;pirit &s;eems to for&s;ake them, is that
            when they feel the influences of natural de&s;ire. They then fight mo&s;t
            de&s;pe|rately; and the male that is victorious, keeps all the females to
            him&s;elf. Their combats on the&s;e occa&s;ions are managed with great
            ob&s;ti|nacy, and yet great ju&s;tice: two are never &s;een to fall upon one
            together; but each has its an|tagoni&s;t, and all fight an equal battle, till
            one alone becomes victorious.</P>
<P>We are not certainly informed how long the females continue
            pregnant; but if we may judge from the time which intervenes between their
            departure from the Greenland coa&s;ts and their return, they cannot go above
            &s;even or eight months at the farthe&s;t. How long this animal lives is al&s;o
            unknown: a gentleman whom I <PB N="177" REF="232"> knew in Ireland, kept two of
            them, which he had taken very young, in his hou&s;e for ten years; and they
            appeared to have the marks of age at the time I &s;aw them, for they were grown
            grey about the muzzle; and it is very probable they did not live many years
            longer. In their natural &s;tate the old ones are &s;een very fat and torpid,
            &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, incapable of
            procreation.</P>
<P>As their chief food is fi&s;h, &s;o they are very expert at
            pur&s;uing and catching it. In tho&s;e places where the herrings are &s;een in
            &s;hoals, the &s;eals frequent and de&s;troy them by thou|&s;ands. When the
            herring retires, the &s;eal is then obliged to hunt after fi&s;h that are
            &s;tronger, and more capable of evading the pur&s;uit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol. i. p. 75.</BIBL></NOTE>: how|ever,
            they are very &s;wift in deep waters, dive with great rapidity, and, while the
            &s;pectator eyes the &s;pot at which they di&s;appear, they are &s;een to
            emerge at above an hundred yards di&s;tance. The weaker fi&s;hes, therefore,
            have no other means to e&s;cape their tyranny, but by darting into the
            &s;hallows. The &s;eal has been &s;een to pur&s;ue a mullet, which is a &s;wift
            &s;wim|mer, and to turn it to and fro, in deep water, as an hound does an hare
            on land. The mullet has been &s;een trying every art of eva&s;ion; and 
            <PB N="178" REF="233"> at la&s;t &s;wimming into &s;hallow water, in hopes of
            e&s;caping. There, however, the &s;eal followed; &s;o that the little animal
            had no other way left to e&s;cape, but to throw it&s;elf on one &s;ide, by
            which means it darted into &s;hoaler water than it could have &s;wam in with
            the belly undermo&s;t; and thus at la&s;t it got free.</P>
<P>As they are thus the tyrants of the element in which they chiefly
            re&s;ide, &s;o they are not very fearful even upon land, except on tho&s;e
            &s;hores which are thickly inhabited, and from whence they have been frequently
            pur&s;ued. Along the de&s;ert coa&s;ts where they are &s;eldom in|terrupted by
            man, they &s;eem to be very bold and courageous; if attacked with &s;tones,
            like dogs, they bite &s;uch as are thrown again&s;t them; if encountered more
            clo&s;ely, they make a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, and, while they have any
            life, attempt to annoy their enemy. Some have been known, even while they were
            &s;kinning, to turn round and &s;eize their butchers; but they are generally
            di&s;patched by a &s;tunning blow on the no&s;e. They u&s;ually &s;leep
            &s;oundly where not frequently di&s;turbed; and that is the time, when the
            hunters &s;urprize them. The Europeans who go into the Greenland &s;eas upon
            the whale-fi&s;hery, &s;urround them with nets, and knock them on the head; but
            the <PB N="179" REF="234"> Greenlanders, wild are unprovided with &s;o
            ex|pen&s;ive an apparatus, de&s;troy them in a differ|ent manner. One of
            the&s;e little men paddles away in his boat, and when he &s;ees a &s;eal
            a&s;leep on the &s;ide of a rock, darts his lance, and that with &s;uch
            unerring aim, that it never fails to bury its point in the animal's &s;ide. The
            &s;eal, feeling it&s;elf wounded, in&s;tantly plunges from the top of the rock,
            lance and all, into the &s;ea, and dives to the bottom; but the lance has a
            bladder tied to one end, which keeps buoyant, and re&s;i&s;ts the animal's
            de&s;cent; &s;o that every time the &s;eal ri&s;es to the top of the water, the
            Greenlander &s;trikes it with his oar, until he at la&s;t di&s;patches it. But,
            in our climate, the &s;eals are much more wary, and &s;eldom &s;uffer the
            hunter to come near them. They are often &s;een upon the rocks of the Corni&s;h
            coa&s;t, ba&s;k|ing in the &s;un, or upon the inacce&s;&s;ible cliffs, left dry
            by the tide. There they continue, extremely watchful, and never &s;leep long
            with|out moving; &s;eldom longer than a minute; for then they rai&s;e their
            heads, and if they &s;ee no danger, they lie down again, rai&s;ing and
            re|clining their heads alternately, at intervals of about a minute each. The
            only method, there|fore, that can be taken, is to &s;hoot them: if they chance
            to e&s;cape, they ha&s;ten towards the <PB N="180" REF="235"> deep, flinging
            &s;tones and dirt behind them as they &s;cramble along, and at the &s;ame time
            expre&s;&s;ing their pain or their fears, by the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful cry; if
            they happen to be overtaken, they make a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance with their
            feet and teeth, till they are killed.</P>
<P>The &s;eal is taken for the &s;ake of its &s;kin, and for the oil
            its fat yields. The former &s;ells for about four &s;hillings; and, when
            dre&s;&s;ed, is very u&s;eful in covering trunks, making wai&s;t-coats,
            &s;hot-pouches, and &s;everal other conve|niencies. The fle&s;h of this animal
            formerly found place at the tables of the great. At a fea&s;t provided by
            Archbi&s;hop Nevell, for Ed|ward the Fourth, there were twelve &s;eals and
            porpoi&s;es provided, among other extraordinary rarities.</P>
<P>As a variety of this animal, we may mention the Sea Lion,
            de&s;cribed in An&s;on's Voyages. This is much larger than any of the former;
            being from eleven to eighteen feet long. It is &s;o fat that, when the &s;kin
            is taken off, the blub|ber lies a foot thick all round the body. It &s;eems to
            differ from the ordinary &s;eal, not only in its &s;ize, but al&s;o in its
            food; for it is often &s;een to graze along the &s;hore, and to feed upon the
            long gra&s;s that grows up along the edges of brooks. Its cry is very various,
            &s;ometimes <PB N="181" REF="237"> re&s;embling the neighing of an hor&s;e, and
            &s;ome|times the grunting of the hog. It may be re|garded as the large&s;t of
            the &s;eal family.</P>

<HEAD>THE MANATI.</HEAD>
<P>WE come, in the la&s;t place, to an animal that terminates the
            boundary between quadru|pedes and fi&s;hes. In&s;tead of a creature preying
            among the deeps, and retiring upon land for <PB N="183" REF="241"> repo&s;e or
            refre&s;hment, we have here an animal that never leaves the water, and is
            enabled to live only there. It cannot be called a quadru|pede, as it has but
            two legs only; nor can it be called a fi&s;h, as it is covered with hair. In
            &s;hort, it forms the link that unites tho&s;e two great tribes to each other;
            and may be indi&s;|criminately called the la&s;t of bea&s;ts, or the fir&s;t of
            fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the &s;eal approaching nearly to the aquatic
            tribes, by having its hind legs thrown back on each &s;ide of the tail, and
            form|ing &s;omething, that re&s;embled the tail of a fi&s;h; but upon examining
            the &s;keleton of that ani|mal, its title to the rank of a quadrupede was
            ob&s;erved plainly to appear, having all the bones of the hinder legs and feet
            as complete as any other animal what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But we are now come to a creature that not only wants the external
            appearance of hinder legs, but, when examined internally, will be found to want
            them altogether. The Manati is &s;omewhat &s;haped in the head and the body
            like the &s;eal; it has al&s;o the fore legs or hands pretty much in the &s;ame
            manner, &s;hort and webbed, but with four claws only: the&s;e al&s;o are
            &s;horter in proportion than in the former animal, and placed nearer the head;
            &s;o that <PB N="184" REF="242"> they can &s;carcely a&s;&s;i&s;t its motions
            upon land. But it is in the hinder parts that it chiefly differs from all
            others of the &s;eal kind; for the tail is perfectly that of a fi&s;h, being
            &s;pread out broad like a fan, and wanting even the ve&s;tiges of tho&s;e bones
            which make the legs and feet in others of its kind. The large&s;t of the&s;e
            are about twenty-&s;ix feet in length; the &s;kin is blacki&s;h, very tough and
            hard; when cut, as black as ebony; and there are a few hairs &s;cat|tered, like
            bri&s;tles, of about an inch long. The eyes are very &s;mall, in proportion to
            the animal's head; and the ear-holes, for it has no external ears, are &s;o
            narrow as &s;carce to admit a pin's head. The tongue is &s;o &s;hort, that
            &s;ome have pretended it has none at all; and the teeth are compo&s;ed only of
            two &s;olid white bones, running the whole length of both jaws, and formed
            merely for chewing, and not tearing its vegetable food. The female has
            brea&s;ts placed forward, like tho&s;e of a woman; and &s;he brings forth but
            one at a time: this &s;he holds with her paws to her bo&s;om; there it
            &s;ticks, and accompanies her wherever &s;he goes.</P>
<P>This animal can &s;carcely be called amphi|bious, as it never
            entirely leaves the water, only advancing the head out of the &s;tream, to 
            <PB N="185" REF="243"> reach the gra&s;s on the river &s;ides. Its food is
            entirely upon vegetables; and, therefore, it is never found far in the open
            &s;ea, but chiefly in the large rivers of South America; and often above two
            thou&s;and miles from the ocean. It is al&s;o found in the &s;eas near
            Kam&s;katka, and feeds upon the weeds that grow near the &s;hore. There are
            likewi&s;e level greens at the bottom of &s;ome of the Indian bays, and there
            the manatees are harmle&s;sly &s;een grazing among turtles and other
            cru&s;taceous fi&s;hes, neither giving nor fearing any di&s;turbance. The&s;e
            animals, when unmole&s;ted, keep together in large companies, and &s;urround
            their young ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta
                Petripolitana.</BIBL></NOTE>. They bring forth mo&s;t commonly in autumn; and
            it is &s;uppo&s;ed they go with young eighteen months, for the time of
            generation is in &s;pring.</P>
<P>The manati has no voice nor cry, for the only noi&s;e it makes, is
            by fetching its breath. Its internal parts &s;omewhat re&s;emble tho&s;e of an
            hor&s;e; its inte&s;tines being longer, in pro|portion, than tho&s;e of any
            other creature, the hor&s;e only excepted.</P>
<P>The fat of the manati, which lies under the &s;kin, when expo&s;ed
            to the &s;un, has a fine &s;mell and ta&s;te, and far exceeds the fat of any
            &s;ea <PB N="186" REF="244"> animal; it has this peculiar property, that the
            heat of the &s;un will not &s;poil it, nor make it grow rancid; its ta&s;te is
            like the oil of &s;weet almonds; and it will &s;erve very well, in all ca&s;es,
            in&s;tead of butter: any quantity may be taken inwardly with &s;afety, for it
            has no other effect than keeping the body open. The fat of the tail is of an
            harder con&s;i&s;tence; and, when boiled, is more delicate than the former. The
            lean is like beef, but more red; and may be kept a long while, in the hotte&s;t
            days, without tainting. It takes up a long time in boiling; and, when done,
            eats like beef. The fat of the young one is like pork; the lean is like veal;
            and, upon the whole, it is very probable that this animal's fle&s;h &s;omewhat
            re&s;embles that of turtle; &s;ince they are fed in the &s;ame element, and
            upon the very &s;ame food. The turtle is a delicacy well known among us: our
            luxuries are not as yet &s;ufficiently heightened to in|troduce the manati;
            which, if it could be brought over, might &s;ingly &s;uffice for a whole
            corporation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Animals of the Monkey Kind.</HEAD>
<P>QUADRUPEDES may be con&s;idered as a numerous groupe, terminated on
          every &s;ide by &s;ome that but in part de&s;erve the name. On one quarter we
          &s;ee a tribe covered with quills, or furni&s;hed with wings, that lift them
          among the inhabitants of air; on another, we behold a diver&s;ity cloathed with
          &s;cales and &s;hells, to rank with in&s;ects; and &s;till, on a third, we
          &s;ee them de&s;cending into the waters, to live among the mute tenants of that
          element. We now come to a numerous tribe, that, leaving the brute creation,
          &s;eem to make approaches even to humanity; that bear an aukward re&s;emblance
          of the human form, and di&s;cover &s;ome faint efforts at intellectual
          &s;agacity.</P>
<P>Animals of the monkey cla&s;s are furni&s;hed with hands in&s;tead
          of paws; their ears, eyes, eye-lids, lips, and brea&s;ts, are like tho&s;e of
          man|kind; their internal conformation al&s;o bears &s;ome di&s;tant likene&s;s;
          and the whole offers a picture that may well mortify the pride of &s;uch as
          make their per&s;ons alone the principal object of their admiration.</P>
<P>The&s;e approaches, however, are gradual; and <PB N="188" REF="246">
          &s;ome bear the marks of this our boa&s;ted form, more &s;trongly than
          others.</P>
<P>In the Ape kind we &s;ee the whole external machine &s;trongly
          impre&s;&s;ed with the human like|ne&s;s, and capable of the &s;ame exertions:
          the&s;e walk upright, want a tail, have fle&s;hy po&s;teriors, have calves to
          their legs, and feet nearly like ours.</P>
<P>In the Baboon kind we perceive a more di&s;tant approach to the
          human form; the quadrupede mixing in every part of the animal's figure: the&s;e
          generally go upon all fours; but &s;ome, when upright, are as tall as a man;
          they have &s;hort tails, long &s;nouts, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of brutal
          fiercene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Monkey kind are removed a &s;tep fur|ther: the&s;e are much
          le&s;s than the former, with tails as long, or longer than their bodies, and
          flatti&s;h faces.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the Maki and Opa&s;&s;um kind, &s;eem to lo&s;e all
          re&s;emblance of the human figure, ex|cept in having hands; their no&s;es are
          length|ened out, like tho&s;e of quadrupedes, and every part of their bodies
          totally different from the human; however, as they gra&s;p their food, or other
          objects, with one hand, which quadru|pedes cannot do, this &s;ingle
          &s;imilitude gives them an air of &s;agacity, to which they have &s;carce any
          other preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>From this &s;light &s;urvey it may be ea&s;ily &s;een 
          <PB N="189" REF="247"> that one general de&s;cription will not &s;erve for
          animals &s;o very different from each other: ne|verthele&s;s, it would be
          fatiguing to the la&s;t de|gree, as their varieties are &s;o numerous, and
          their differences &s;o &s;mall, to go through a particular de&s;cription of
          each. In this ca&s;e it will be be&s;t to give an hi&s;tory of the foremo&s;t
          in each cla&s;s; at the &s;ame time marking the di&s;tinctions in every
          &s;pecies. By this we &s;hall avoid a tedious repetition of &s;imilar
          characters, and con&s;ider the manners and the oddities of this phanta&s;tic
          tribe in general points of view; where we &s;hall perceive how nearly they
          ap|proach to the human figure, and how little they benefit by the
          approximation.</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t of the Ape kind is the Ourang Outang, or Wild Man of
          the Woods. This name &s;eems to have been given to various ani|mals, agreeing
          in one common character of walking upright, but coming from different
          countries, and of very different proportions and powers. The Troglodyte of
          Bontius, the Drill of Purchas, and the Pygmy of Ty&s;on, have all received this
          general name; and have been ranked, by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, under one general
          de&s;cription. If we read the accounts of many remote travellers, under this
          name we are pre&s;ented with a formidable animal, from <PB N="190" REF="248">
          &s;ix to eight feet high; if we examine the books of &s;uch as have de&s;cribed
          it nearer home, we find it a pigmy not above three. In this di|ver&s;ity we
          mu&s;t be content to blend their va|rious de&s;criptions into one general
          account; ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that we have no rea&s;on to doubt any
          of their relations, although we are puzzled which to follow.</P>
<P>The Ouran Outang, which, of all other ani|mals, mo&s;t nearly
          approaches to the human race, is &s;een of different &s;izes, from three to
          &s;even feet high. In general, however, its &s;ta|ture is le&s;s than that of a
          man; but its &s;trength and agility much greater. Travellers who have &s;een
          various kinds of the&s;e animals in their native &s;olitudes, give us
          &s;urprizing relations of their force, their &s;wiftne&s;s, their addre&s;s,
          and their ferocity. Naturali&s;ts who have ob&s;erved their form and manners at
          home, have been as much &s;truck with their patient, pliant, imitative
          di&s;po&s;itions; with their appearance and con|formation, &s;o nearly human.
          Of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ort of the&s;e animals we have had &s;everal, at
          different times, brought into this country, all nearly alike; but that
          ob&s;erved by Dr. Ty&s;on, is the be&s;t known, having been de&s;cribed with
          the greate&s;t exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>The animal which was de&s;cribed by that <PB N="191" REF="249">
          learned phy&s;ician, was brought from Angola in Africa, where it had been taken
          in the internal parts of the country, in company with a female of the &s;ame
          kind, that died by the way. The body was covered with hair, which was of a coal
          black colour, more re&s;embling human hair than that of brutes. It bore a
          &s;till &s;tronger &s;imilitude in its different lengths; for in tho&s;e places
          where it is longe&s;t on the human &s;pecies, it was al&s;o longe&s;t in this;
          as on the head, the upper lip, the chin, and the pubes. The face was like that
          of a man, the forehead larger, and the head round. The upper and lower jaw were
          not &s;o prominent as in monkies; but flat, like tho&s;e of a man. The ears
          were like tho&s;e of a man in mo&s;t re&s;pects; and the teeth had more
          re&s;emblance to the human, than tho&s;e of any other creature. The bending of
          the arms and legs were ju&s;t the &s;ame as in a man; and, in &s;hort, the
          animal, at fir&s;t view, pre&s;ented a figure entirely human.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;cover its differences, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to
          take a clo&s;er &s;urvey; and then the imperfections of its form began to
          appear. The fir&s;t obvious difference was in the flatne&s;s of the no&s;e; the
          next in the lowne&s;s of the forehead, and the wanting the prominence of the
          chin. The ears were proportionably too large; the <PB N="192" REF="250"> eyes
          too clo&s;e to each other; and the interval between the no&s;e and mouth too
          great. The body and limbs differed, in the thighs be|ing too &s;hort, and the
          arms too long; in the thumb being too little, and the palm of the hand too
          narrow. The feet al&s;o were rather more like hands than feet; and the animal,
          if we may judge from the figure, bent too much upon its haunches.</P>
<P>When this creature was examined anato|mically, a &s;urprizing
          &s;imilitude was &s;een to prevail in its internal conformation. It differed
          from man in the number of its ribs, having thirteen; whereas, in man, there are
          but twelve. The vertebrae of the neck al&s;o were &s;horter, the bones of the
          pelvis narrower, the orbits of the eyes were deeper, the kidnies were round|er,
          the urinary and gall bladders were longer and &s;maller, and the ureters of a
          different figure. Such were the principal di&s;tinctions between the internal
          parts of this animal and tho&s;e of man; in almo&s;t every thing el&s;e they
          were entirely and exactly the &s;ame, and di&s;|covered an a&s;toni&s;hing
          congruity. Indeed, many parts were &s;o much alike in confor|mation, that it
          might have excited wonder how they were productive of &s;uch few advantages.
          The tongue, and all the organs of the voice, <PB N="193" REF="251"> were the
          &s;ame, and yet the animal was dumb; the brain was formed in the &s;ame manner
          with that of man, and yet the creature wanted rea|&s;on: an evident proof (as
          Mr. Buffon finely ob|&s;erves) that no di&s;po&s;ition of matter will give
          mind; and that the body, how nicely &s;oever formed, is formed in vain, when
          there is not infu&s;ed a &s;oul to direct its operations.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a comparative view of this creature with man, what
          follows may be nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the general de&s;cription. This animal
          was very hairy all behind, from the head downwards; and the hair &s;o thick,
          that it covered the &s;kin almo&s;t from being &s;een: but in all parts before,
          the hair was much thinner, the &s;kin every where appeared; and in &s;ome
          places it was almo&s;t bare. When it went on all fours, as it was &s;ometimes
          &s;een to do, it appeared all hairy; when it went erect, it appeared before
          le&s;s hairy, and more like a man. Its hair, which in this particular animal
          was black, much more re&s;embled that of men than the fur of brutes; for, in
          the latter, be|&s;ides their long hair, there is u&s;ually a finer and
          &s;horter intermixed; but in the ouran outang it was all of a kind; only about
          the pubes the hair was greyi&s;h, &s;eemed longer, and &s;omewhat different; as
          al&s;o on the upper lip and chin, <PB N="194" REF="252"> where it was
          greyi&s;h, like the hair of a beard. The face, hands, and &s;oles of the feet,
          were without hair; and &s;o was mo&s;t part of the forehead: but down the
          &s;ides of the face the hair was thick, it being there about an inch and an
          half long, which exceeded that on any other part of the body. In the palms of
          its hands were remarkable tho&s;e lines which are u&s;ually taken notice of in
          palmi&s;try; and, at the tips of the fingers, tho&s;e &s;piral lines
          ob|&s;erved in man. The palms of the hands were as long as the &s;oles of the
          feet; and the toes upon the&s;e were as long as the fingers; the middle toe was
          the longe&s;t of all, and the whole foot differed from the human. The hinder
          feet being thus formed as hands, the animal often u&s;ed them as &s;uch; and,
          on the contrary, now and then made u&s;e of its hands in&s;tead of feet. The
          brea&s;ts appeared &s;mall and &s;hrivelled, but exactly like tho&s;e of a man:
          the navel al&s;o appeared very fair, and in exact di&s;|po&s;ition, being
          neither harder nor more pro|minent than what is u&s;ually &s;een in children.
          Such is the de&s;cription of this extraordinary creature; to which little has
          been added by &s;ucceeding ob&s;ervers, except that the colour of the hair is
          often found to vary: in that de|&s;cribed by Edwards it was of a reddi&s;h
          brown.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="253">From a picture &s;o like that of the human
          &s;pecies, we are naturally led to expect a cor|re&s;ponding mind; and it is
          certain, that &s;uch of the&s;e animals as have been &s;hewn in Europe, have
          di&s;covered a degree of imitation beyond what any quadrupede can arrive
          at.</P>
<P>That of Ty&s;on was a gentle, fond, harmleis creature. In its
          pa&s;&s;age to England, tho&s;e that it knew on &s;hip-board it would embrace
          with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, opening their bo&s;oms, and cla&s;ping its
          hands about them. Monkies of a lower &s;pecies it held in utter aver&s;ion; it
          would always avoid the place where they were kept in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el; and
          &s;eemed to con&s;ider it&s;elf as a creature of higher extraction. After it
          was taken, and a little u&s;ed to wear cloaths, it grew very fond of them; a
          part it would put on without any help, and the re&s;t it would carry in its
          hands to &s;ome of the company, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It would lie in a
          bed, place its head on the pillow, and pull the cloaths up|wards, as a man
          would do.</P>
<P>That which was &s;een by Edwards, and de|&s;cribed by Buffon,
          &s;hewed even a &s;uperior de|gree of &s;agacity. It walked, like all of its
          kind, upon two legs, even though it carried burthens. Its air was melancholly,
          and its deportment grave. Unlike the baboon or monkey, who&s;e 
          <PB N="196" REF="254"> motions are violent and appetites capricious, who are
          fond of mi&s;chief and obedient only from fear, this animal was &s;low in in
          its mo|tions, and a look was &s;ufficient to keep it in awe. I have &s;een it,
          &s;ays Mr. Buffon, give its hand to &s;how the company to the door: I have
          &s;een it &s;it at table, unfold its napkin, wipe its lips, make u&s;e of the
          &s;poon and the fork to carry the victuals to its mouth, pour out its drink
          into a gla&s;s, touch gla&s;&s;es when invited, take a cup and &s;aucer and lay
          them on the table, put in &s;ugar, pour out its tea, leave it to cool be|fore
          drinking, and all this without any other in&s;tigation than the &s;igns or the
          command of its ma&s;ter, and often of its own accord. It was gentle and
          inoffen&s;ive; it even approached &s;trangers with re&s;pect, and came rather
          to re|ceive care&s;&s;es than to offer injuries. It was par|ticularly fond of
          &s;ugared comfits, which every body was ready to give it; and, as it had a
          de|fluxion upon the bread, &s;o much &s;ugar contri|buted to encrea&s;e the
          di&s;order and &s;horten its life. It continued at Paris but one &s;ummer, and
          died in London. It ate indi&s;criminately of all things, but it preferred dry
          and ripe fruits to all other aliments. It would drink wine, but in &s;mall
          quantities, and gladly left it for milk, tea, or any other &s;weet liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="255">Such the&s;e animals appeared when brought
          into Europe. However, many of their extra|ordinary habits were probably the
          re&s;ult of edu|cation, and we are not told how, long the in|&s;tructions they
          received for this purpo&s;e were continued. But we learn from another account
          that they take but a very &s;hort time to come to a great degree of imitative
          perfection. Mr. L. Bro&s;&s;e bought two young ones, that were but a year old,
          from a Negroe; and the&s;e at that early age di&s;covered an a&s;toni&s;hing
          power of imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>As quoted by Buffon, vol.
              xxviii. p. 77.</BIBL></NOTE>. They even then &s;at at the table like men, ate
          of every thing without di&s;tinc|tion, made u&s;e of their knife, &s;poon, and
          fork, both to eat their meat and help them&s;elves. They drank wine and other
          liquors. When carried on &s;hipboard, they had &s;igns for the cabbin boys
          expre&s;&s;ive of their wants; and whenever the&s;e neglected attending upon
          them as they de&s;ired, they in&s;tantly flew into a pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;eized
          them by the arm, bit them, and kept them down. The male was &s;ea-&s;ick, and
          required attendance like an human creature; he was even twice bled in the arm;
          and every time afterwards when he found him&s;elf out of order, he &s;hewed his
          arm, as de&s;irous of being relieved by bleeding.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="256">Pyrard relates, that in the province of Sierra
          Leona, in Africa, there are a kind of apes, called Baris, which are &s;trong
          and mu&s;cular, and which, if properly in&s;tructed when young, &s;erve as very
          u&s;eful dome&s;tics. They u&s;ually walk upright; they pound at a mortar; they
          go to the river to fetch water, this they carry back in a little pitcher, on
          their heads; but if care be not taken to receive the pitcher at their return,
          they let it fall to the ground, and then, &s;eeing it broken, they begin to
          lament and cry for their lo&s;s. Le Compte's account is much to the &s;ame
          purpo&s;e of an ape, which he &s;aw in the Streights of Molucca. 
          <Q REND="inline">"It walked upon its two hind feet, which it bent a
            little, like a dog that had been taught to dance. It made u&s;e of its hands
            and arms as we do. Its vi&s;age was not much more di&s;agreeable than that of
            an Hottentot; but the body was all over covered with a woolly hair of different
            colours. As to the re&s;t, it cried like a child; all its outward ac|tions were
            &s;o like the human, and the pa&s;&s;ions &s;o lively and &s;ignificant, that
            dumb men could &s;carce better expre&s;s their conceptions and de|&s;ires. It
            had al&s;o that expre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion or joy which we often &s;ee in
            children, &s;tamping with its feet, and &s;triking them again&s;t the ground,
            to &s;hew its &s;pight, or when refu&s;ed <PB N="199" REF="257"> any thing it
            pa&s;&s;ionately longed for. Although the&s;e animals," continues he, "are very
            big, for that I &s;aw was four feet high, their nimble|ne&s;s is incredible. It
            is a plea&s;ure beyond expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ee them run up the tackling of a
            &s;hip, where they &s;ometimes play as if they had a knack of vaulting peculiar
            to them&s;elves, or as if they had been paid, like our rope-dancers, to divert
            the company. Sometimes, &s;u&s;pended by one arm, they poize them&s;elves, and
            then turn all of a &s;udden round about a rope, with as much quickne&s;s as a
            wheel, or a &s;ling put into motion. Sometimes holding the rope
            &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively with their long fingers, and, letting their whole body fall
            into the air, they run full &s;peed from one end to the other, and come back
            again with the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s. There is no po&s;ture but they imitate,
            nor motion but they perform. Bending them&s;elves like a bow, rolling like a
            bowl, hanging by the hands, feet, and teeth, according to the different
            fan|cies with which their capricious imagination &s;upplies them. But what is
            &s;till more amazing than all is, their agility to fling them&s;elves from one
            rope to another, though at thirty, forty, and fifty feet di&s;tance."</Q></P>
<P>Such are the habitudes and the powers of the &s;maller cla&s;s of
          the&s;e extraordinary creatures; <PB N="200" REF="258"> but we are pre&s;ented
          with a very different pic|ture in tho&s;e of a larger &s;tature and more
          mu&s;|cular form. The little animals we have been de&s;cribing, which are
          &s;eldom found above four feet high, &s;eem to partake of the nature of dwarfs
          among the human &s;pecies, being gentle, a&s;&s;iduous, and playful, rather
          fitted to amu&s;e than terrify. But the gigantic races of the Ourang Outang,
          &s;een and de&s;cribed by travellers, are truly formidable; and in the gloomy
          fore&s;ts, where they are only found, &s;eem to hold undi&s;|puted dominion.
          Many of the&s;e are as tall or taller than a man; active, &s;trong and
          intrepid, cunning, la&s;civious and cruel. This redoubtable rival of mankind is
          found in many parts of Africa, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, in Madaga&s;car, and in
          Borneo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Compte's Hi&s;tory of
              China.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the la&s;t of the&s;e places, the people of quality
          cour&s;e him as we do the &s;tag; and this &s;ort of hunting is one of the
          favourite amu&s;ements of the king him&s;elf. This creature is extremely
          &s;wift of foot, endowed with extra|ordinary &s;trength, and runs with
          prodigious celerity. His &s;kin is all hairy, his eyes &s;unk in his head, his
          countenance &s;tern, his face tanned, and all his lineaments, though exactly
          human, har&s;h and blackened by the &s;un. In Africa this creature is even
          &s;till more formidable. Battel calls <PB N="201" REF="259"> him the Pongo, and
          a&s;&s;ures us that in all his proportions he re&s;embles a man, except that he
          is much larger, even to a gigantic &s;tate. His face re&s;embles that of a man,
          the eyes deep &s;unk in the head, the hair on each &s;ide ex|tremely long, the
          vi&s;age naked and without hair, as al&s;o the ears and the hands. The body is
          lightly covered, and &s;carcely differing from that of a man, except that there
          are no calves to the legs. Still, however, the animal is &s;een to walk upon
          his hinder legs, and in an erect po&s;ture. He &s;leeps under trees, and builds
          him&s;elf an hut, which &s;erves to protect him again&s;t the &s;un and the
          rains of the tropical climates, of which he is a native. He lives only upon
          fruits, and is no way carnivorous. He cannot &s;peak, although furni&s;hed with
          greater in&s;tinct than any other animal of the brute creation. When the
          Negroes make a fire in the woods, this animal comes near and warms him|&s;elf
          by the blaze. However, he has not &s;kill enough to keep the flame alive by
          feeding it with fuel. They go together in companies; and if they happen to meet
          one of the human &s;pecies, remote from &s;uccour, they &s;hew him no mercy.
          They even attack the elephant, which they beat with their clubs, and oblige to
          leave that part of the fore&s;t which they claim <PB N="202" REF="260"> as
          their own. It is impo&s;&s;ible to take any of the&s;e dreadful creatures
          alive, for they are &s;o &s;trong that ten men would not be a match for but one
          of them. None of this kind, therefore, are taken except when very young, and
          the&s;e but rarely, when the female happens to leave them behind, for in
          general they keep clung to the brea&s;t, and adhere both with legs and arms.
          From the &s;ame traveller we learn, that when one of the&s;e animals dies, the
          re&s;t cover the body with a quantity of leaves and branches. They &s;ometimes
          al&s;o &s;hew mercy to the human kind. A Negroe boy, that was taken by one of
          the&s;e, and carried into the woods, continued there a whole year, without
          receiving any in|jury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Bro&s;&s;e, as quoted by
              Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 70.</BIBL></NOTE>. From another traveller we learn,
          that the&s;e animals often attempt to &s;urprize the fe|male Negroes as they go
          into the woods, and frequently keep them again&s;t their wills for the
          plea&s;ure of their company, feeding them very plentifully all the time. He
          a&s;&s;ures us that he knew a woman of Loango that had lived among the&s;e
          animals for three years. They grow from &s;ix to &s;even feet high, and are of
          unequalled &s;trength. They build &s;heds, and make u&s;e of clubs for their
          defence. Their faces are broad, their no&s;es flat, their ears without a tip, 
          <PB N="203" REF="261"> their &s;kins are more bright than that of a Mul|latoe,
          and they are covered on many parts of the body with long and tawny coloured
          hair. Their belly is large, their heels flat, and yet ri&s;ing behind. They
          &s;ometimes walk upright, and &s;ometimes upon all fours, when they are
          phanta&s;tically di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription of the Ouran Outang, we perceive at what a
          di&s;tance the fir&s;t animal of the brute creation is placed from the very
          lowe&s;t of the human &s;pecies. Even in countries peopled with &s;avages, this
          creature is con&s;idered as a bea&s;t; and in tho&s;e very places where we
          might &s;uppo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t difference between them and mankind, the
          inhabitants hold it in the greate&s;t contempt and dete&s;tation. In Borneo,
          where this animal has been &s;aid to come to its greate&s;t perfection, the
          natives hunt it in the &s;ame manner as they pur&s;ue the elephant or the lion,
          while its re|&s;emblance to the human form procures it neither pity nor
          protection. The gradations of Nature in the other parts of nature are minute
          and in|&s;en&s;ible; in the pa&s;&s;age from quadrupedes to fi&s;hes we can
          &s;carce tell where the quadrupede ends and the fi&s;h begins; in the de&s;cent
          from bea&s;ts to in&s;ects we can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;teps of the
          progre&s;&s;ion; but in the a&s;cent from brutes to man, the line is &s;trongly
          drawn, well <PB N="204" REF="262"> marked, and unpa&s;&s;able. It is in vain
          that the Ouran Outang re&s;embles man in form, or imi|tates many of his
          actions; he &s;till continues a wretched, helple&s;s creature, pent up in the
          mo&s;t gloomy part of the fore&s;t, and, with regard to the provi&s;ion for his
          own happine&s;s, inferior even to the elephant or the beaver in &s;agacity. To
          us, indeed, this animal &s;eems much wi&s;er than it really is. As we have long
          been u&s;ed to mea&s;ure the &s;agacity of all actions by their &s;imilitude to
          our own, and not their fitne&s;s to the animal's way of living, we are
          plea&s;ed with the imitations of the ape, even though we know they are far from
          contributing to the convenience of its &s;ituation. An ape, or a quadrupede,
          when under the tramels of human education, may be an admirable object for human
          curio&s;ity, but is very little advanced by all its learning in the road to its
          own felicity. On the contrary, I have never &s;een any of the&s;e long
          in&s;tructed animals that did not, by their melancholly air, appear
          &s;en&s;ible of the wretch|edne&s;s of their &s;ituation. Its marks of
          &s;eeming &s;agacity were merely relative to us and not to the animal; and all
          its boa&s;ted wi&s;dom was merely of our own making.</P>
<P>There is, in fact, another circum&s;tance re|lative to this animal
          which ought not to be <PB REF="263">

          concealed. I have many rea&s;ons to believe that the mo&s;t perfect of the kind
          are prone, like the re&s;t of the quadrupede creation, and only owe their erect
          attitude to human education. Almo&s;t all the travellers who &s;peak of them
          mention their going &s;ometimes upon all fours, and &s;ometimes erect. As their
          chief re&s;idence is among trees, they are without doubt u&s;ually &s;een erect
          while they are climbing; but it is more than probable that their efforts to
          e&s;cape upon the ground are by running upon the hands and feet together.
          Schouten, who mentions their education, tells us that they are taken in traps,
          and taught in the beginning to walk upon their hind legs; which certainly
          implies that in a &s;tate of nature they run upon all fours. Add to this, that,
          when we examine the palms of their hands and the &s;oals of their feet, we find
          both equally cal|lous and beaten; a certain proof that both have been equally
          u&s;ed. In tho&s;e hot countries, where the apes are known to re&s;ide, the
          &s;oals of the Ne|groes feet, who go bare-foot, are covered with a &s;kin above
          an inch thick; while their hands are as &s;oft as tho&s;e of an European. Did
          the apes walk in the &s;ame manner, the &s;ame exerci&s;e would have
          furni&s;hed them with &s;imilar advan|tages, which is not the ca&s;e. Be&s;ides
          all this, I have been a&s;&s;ured by a very credible traveller, 
          <PB N="206" REF="267"> that the&s;e animals naturally run in the woods upon all
          fours; and when they are taken, their hands are tied behind them, to teach them
          to walk upright. This attitude they learn after &s;ome time; and, thus
          in&s;tructed, they are &s;ent into Europe to a&s;toni&s;h the &s;peculative
          with their near approaches to humanity, while it is never con&s;idered how much
          is natural, and how much has been acquired in the &s;avage &s;chools of Benin
          and Angola.</P>
<P>The animal next to the&s;e, and to be placed in the &s;ame cla&s;s,
          is the Ape, properly &s;o called, or the Pithekos of the ancients. This is much
          le&s;s than the former, being not above a foot and an half high, but walks
          erect, is without a tail, and is ea&s;ily tamed.</P>
<P>Of this kind al&s;o is the Gibbon, &s;o called by Buffon, or the
          Long Armed Ape, which is a very extraordinary and remarkable creature. It is of
          different &s;izes, being from four feet to two feet high. It walks erect, is
          without a tail, has a face re&s;embling that of a man, with a circle of bu&s;hy
          hair all round the vi&s;age; its eyes are large and &s;unk in its head; its
          face tanned and its ears exactly proportioned. But that in which it chiefly
          differs from all others of the monkey tribe is the extraordinary length of its
          arms, which, when the animal <PB REF="268">

          bone. It differs al&s;o in having a large callous red rump. The face is
          prominent, and approaches more to that of quadrupedes than of man. The body is
          covered with a browni&s;h hair, and yellow on the belly. It is about three feet
          and an half, or four feet high, and is a native of mo&s;t parts of Africa and

<HEAD>THE BABOON.</HEAD>
<P>DESCENDING from the more perfect of the monkey kinds, we come to
            the baboon and its varieties, a large, fierce, and formidable race, that,
            mixing the figure of the man and the quadrupede in their conformation, &s;eem
            to po&s;|&s;e&s;s only the defects of both; the petulance of the one, and the
            ferocity of the other. The&s;e animals have a &s;hort tail; a prominent face;
            with canine teeth, larger than tho&s;e of men, and callo&s;&s;ities on the
            rump<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 183.</BIBL></NOTE>.
            In man the phy&s;iognomy may deceive, and the figure of body does not always
            lead to the qualities of the mind; but in animals we may always judge of their
            di&s;po&s;itions by their looks, and form a ju&s;t conjecture of their internal
            habits from their external form. If we compare the nature of the ape and baboon
            by this ea&s;y rule, we &s;hall at once be led to pronounce that they greatly
            differ in their di&s;po&s;itions, and that the latter are infinitely more
            fierce, &s;avage and malicious than the former. The ouran outang, that &s;o
            nearly re&s;embles man in its figure, approaches al&s;o neare&s;t in the
            gentlene&s;s of its manners and the pliancy of its temper. The cynocephalus,
            that of all other apes is mo&s;t unlike man in <PB N="209" REF="276"> form, and
            approaches nearer the dog in face, re&s;embles al&s;o the brute in nature,
            being wild, re&s;tle&s;s, and impelled by a fretful impetuo&s;ity. But the
            baboon, who is &s;till more remote, and re&s;embles man only in having hands,
            who, from having a tail, a prominent face, and &s;harp claws, approaches more
            nearly to the &s;avage tribe, is every way fierce, malicious, ignorant and
            un|tractable.</P>
<P>The baboon, properly &s;o called, is from three to four feet high,
            very &s;trong built, with a thick body and limbs, and canine teeth, much longer
            than tho&s;e of men. It has large cal|lo&s;ities behind, which are quite naked
            and red. Its tail is crooked and thick, and about &s;even or eight inches long.
            Its &s;nout, for it can hardly be called a face, is long and thick, and on each
            &s;ide of its cheeks it has a pouch, into which, when &s;atiated with eating,
            it puts the remainder of its provi&s;ions. It is covered with long thick hair
            of a reddi&s;h brown colour, and pretty uniform over the whole body. It walks
            more commonly upon all fours than up|right, and its hands as well as its feet
            are armed with long &s;harp claws, in&s;tead of the broad round nails of the
            ape kind.</P>
<P>An animal thus made for &s;trength, and fur|ni&s;hed with
            dangerous weapons, is found in fact <PB N="210" REF="277"> to be one of the
            mo&s;t formidable of the &s;avage race, in tho&s;e countries where it is bred.
            It appears in its native woods, to be impelled by two oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions;
            an hatred for the males of the human &s;pecies, and a de&s;ire for women. Were
            we a&s;&s;ured of the&s;e &s;trange oppo&s;itions in its di&s;po&s;ition from
            one te&s;timony alone, the account might appear doubtful; but, as it comes from
            a variety of the mo&s;t credible witne&s;&s;es, we cannot refu&s;e our
            a&s;&s;ent. From them, therefore, we learn that the&s;e animals will often
            a&s;&s;ail women in a body, and force them into the woods, where they keep them
            again&s;t their will, and kill them when refractory. From the Chevalier Forbin
            we learn, that in Siam whole troops of the&s;e will often &s;ally forth from
            their fore&s;ts, and attack a village, when they know the men are engaged in
            their rice harve&s;t. They are on &s;uch occa&s;ions actuated as well by
            de&s;ire as by hunger; and not only plunder the hou&s;es of whatever
            provi&s;ions they can find, but endeavour to force the women. The&s;e, however,
            as the Chevalier humourou&s;ly relates, not at all liking either the manners or
            the figure of the paltry gallants, boldly &s;tand on their defence, and with
            clubs, or whatever other arms they can provide, in&s;tead of an&s;wering their
            care&s;&s;es, oblige their ugly &s;uitors to retreat; <PB N="211" REF="278">
            not, however, before they have damaged or plundered every thing eatable they
            can lay their hands on.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope they are le&s;s for|midable, but to the
            be&s;t of their power equally mi&s;chievous. They are there under a &s;ort of
            natural di&s;cipline, and go about whatever they undertake with &s;urprizing
            &s;kill and regularity. When they &s;et about robbing an orchard or a vineyard,
            for they are extremely fond of grapes, apples, and ripe fruit, they do not go
            &s;ingly to work, but in large companies, and with pre|concerted deliberation.
            On the&s;e occa&s;ions, a part of them enter the enclo&s;ure, while one is
            &s;et to watch. The re&s;t &s;tand without the fence, and form a line reaching
            all the way from their fellows within to their rendezvous without, which is
            generally in &s;ome craggy mountain. Every thing being thus di&s;po&s;ed, the
            plunderers within the orchard throw the fruit to tho&s;e that are without as
            fa&s;t as they can gather it; or, if the wall or hedge be high, to tho&s;e that
            &s;it on the top; and the&s;e hand the plunder to tho&s;e next them on the
            other &s;ide. Thus the fruit is pitched from one to another all along the line,
            till it is &s;afely depo&s;ited at their head quarters. They catch it as
            readily as the mo&s;t &s;kilful tennis player can a ball; and while the
            bu&s;ine&s;s <PB N="212" REF="279"> is going forward, which they conduct with
            great expedition, a mo&s;t profound &s;ilence is ob&s;erved among them. Their
            centinel, during this whole time, continues upon the watch, extremely anxious
            and attentive; but if he perceives any one coming, he in&s;tantly &s;ets up a
            loud cry, and at this &s;ignal the whole company &s;camper off. Nor yet are
            they at any time willing to leave the place empty handed; for if they be
            plun|dering a bed of melons, for in&s;tance, they go off with one in their
            mouths, one in their hands, and one under their arm. If the pur&s;uit is hot,
            they drop fir&s;t that from under their arm, then that from their hand; and, if
            it be continued, they at la&s;t let fall that which they had hitherto kept in
            their mouths.</P>
<P>The natives of the Cape often take the young of the&s;e animals,
            and, feeding them with &s;heep and goats milk, accu&s;tom them to guard their
            hou&s;es; which duty they perform with great punctuality. Tho&s;e, however,
            that have been brought into Europe, are head&s;trong, rude, and untractable.
            Dogs and cats, when they have done any thing wrong, will run off; but the&s;e
            &s;eem carele&s;s and in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;chief they do; and I have
            &s;een one of them break a whole table of china, as it &s;hould &s;eem by
            de&s;ign, with|out appearing in the lea&s;t con&s;cious of having 
            <PB N="213" REF="280"> done ami&s;s. It was not, however, in any re&s;pect &s;o
            formidable as that de&s;cribed by Mr. Buffon, of which he gives the following
            de&s;cription. 
            <Q REND="inline">"It was not," &s;ays he, "extremely ugly, and yet
              it excited horror. It continually appeared in a &s;tate of &s;avage ferocity,
              gna&s;hing its teeth, flying at the &s;pectators, and furiou&s;ly re&s;tle&s;s.
              It was obliged to be confined in an iron cage, the bars of which it &s;o
              forcibly attempted to break, that the &s;pectators were &s;truck with
              apprehen|&s;ion. It was a &s;tocky bold animal, who&s;e &s;hort limbs and
              powerful exertions &s;hewed va&s;t &s;trength and agility. The long hair with
              which it was covered &s;eemed to add to its apparent abilities; which, however,
              were in reality &s;o great, that it could ea&s;ily overcome more than a
              &s;ingle man, unle&s;s armed. As to the re&s;t, it for ever appeared excited by
              that pa&s;&s;ion which renders the milde&s;t animals at intervals furious. Its
              la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s was con&s;tant, and its &s;atisfac|tions particular. Some
              others al&s;o of the monkey kind &s;hewed the &s;ame degree of impudence, and
              particularly in the pre&s;ence of women; but, as they were le&s;s in &s;ize,
              their petulance was le&s;s obvious, and their in&s;olence more ea&s;ily
              cor|rected."</Q></P>
<P>But, however violent the de&s;ires of the&s;e animals may be, they
            are not found to breed <PB N="214" REF="281"> in our climate. The female brings
            forth u&s;ually but one at a time, which &s;he carries in her arms, and in a
            peculiar manner clinging to her brea&s;t. As to the re&s;t, the&s;e animals are
            not at all car|nivorous; they principally feed upon fruits, roots, and corn,
            and generally keep together in companies. The internal parts are more unlike
            tho&s;e of man than of quadrupedes, particularly the liver, which is like that
            of a dog divided into &s;ix lobes. The lungs are more divided, the guts in
            general are &s;horter, and the kidnies rounder and flatter.</P>
<P>The large&s;t of the baboon kind is the Man|dril; an ugly
            di&s;gu&s;ting animal, with a tail &s;horter than the former, though of a much
            larger &s;ta|ture, being from four to five feet high. The muzzle is &s;till
            longer than that of the preceding, it is of a blui&s;h colour, and &s;trongly
            marked with wrinkles, which give it a frightful ap|pearance. But what renders
            it truly loath&s;ome is, that from the no&s;e there is always &s;een
            i&s;|&s;uing a &s;not, which the animal takes care at in|tervals to lick off
            with its tongue and &s;wallow. it is a native of the Gold Coa&s;t; it is &s;aid
            to walk more frequently erect than upon all fours; and when di&s;plea&s;ed, to
            weep like a child. There was one of them &s;hewn in England &s;ome years ago.
            It &s;eemed tame but &s;tupid, and had a <PB REF="282">

            feeble. The tail is from &s;even to eight inches long; the muzzle is prominent
            as in the re&s;t of this kind; but what particularly di&s;tingui&s;hes it is a
            large long white head of hair, together with a mon&s;trous white beard,
            coar&s;e, rough, and de&s;cending; the colour of the re&s;t of the body being
            brown or black. As to the re&s;t, in its &s;avage &s;tate, it is equally fierce
            with the others; but, with a proper education, it &s;eems more tractable than
            mo&s;t of its kind, and is chiefly &s;een in the woods of Ceylon and
            Ma|labar.</P>
<P>The Maimon of Buffon, which Edwards calls the Pigtail, is the
            la&s;t of the baboons, and in &s;ize rather approaches the monkey, being no
            larger than a cat. Its chief di&s;tinction, be&s;ides its pro|minent muzzle,
            like a baboon, is in the tail, which is about five or &s;ix inches long, and
            curled up like that of an hog; from which cir|cum&s;tance, peculiar to this
            animal, our Engli&s;h naturali&s;t gave it the name. It is a native of Sumatra,
            and does not well endure the rigours of our climate. Edwards, however, kept one

<HEAD>THE MONKEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE varieties in the larger tribes of the monkey kind are but few;
            in the ape we have &s;een but four, and in the baboon about as many. But when
            we come to the &s;maller cla&s;s, the dif|ferences among them &s;eem too
            tedious for enu|meration. The&s;e, as was ob&s;erved in the be|ginning, are all
            &s;mall in &s;tature, and with long tails, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed
            from the preceding, that entirely want the tail, or are large and have but a
            &s;hort one. The varieties in the form and colour of dogs, or &s;quirrels, is
            nothing to what are found among monkies of the &s;maller kind. Bo&s;man
            mentions above fifty &s;orts on the Gold Coa&s;t alone, and Smith con|firms the
            account. Condamine a&s;&s;erts that it would take up a volume to de&s;cribe the
            diffe|rences of the&s;e to be found along the river Amazons; and we are &s;ure
            that every one of <PB N="217" REF="287"> the&s;e is very different from tho&s;e
            on the African coa&s;t. Naturali&s;ts, however, have undertaken to make a
            catalogue of their numbers; and they either tran&s;mit their de&s;criptions
            from one to another, or only enumerate tho&s;e few that have found their way to
            Europe, and have fallen within the narrow circle of their own ob&s;erva|tion.
            But, though it may be proper enough to de&s;cribe &s;uch as fall under notice,
            it is certainly wrong to offer a &s;canty catalogue as complete, and to induce
            the reader to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;ees a picture of the whole groupe of the&s;e
            animals when he is only pre&s;ented with a &s;mall part of the number. Such,
            therefore, as are fond of the reputation of adding new de&s;criptions to the
            &s;tock of natural hi&s;tory, have here a wide, though &s;urely a barren, field
            to enlarge in; and they will find it no difficult matter, by ob&s;erv|ing the
            various animals of this kind that are from time to time brought from their
            native coa&s;ts to this country, to indulge in de&s;cription, and to ring the
            changes upon all the technical terms with which this mo&s;t plea&s;ing
            &s;cience is ob&s;cured and rendered di&s;gu&s;ting. For my own part, I will
            &s;pare the reader and my&s;elf the trouble of entering into an elaborate
            de&s;cription of each; content with ob&s;erving once more, that their numbers
            are very great and their dif|ferences <PB N="218" REF="288"> very trifling.
            There is &s;carce a country in the tropical climates that does not &s;warm with
            them, and &s;carce a fore&s;t that is not inhabited by a race of monkies
            di&s;tinct from all others. Every different wood along the coa&s;ts of Africa
            may be con&s;idered as a &s;eparate colony of mon|kies, differing from tho&s;e
            of the next di&s;trict in colour, in &s;ize, and malicious mi&s;chief. It is
            indeed remarkable that the monkies of two cantons are never found to mix with
            each other, but rigorou&s;ly to ob&s;erve a &s;eparation; each fore&s;t
            produces only its own; and the&s;e guard their limits from the intru&s;ion of
            all &s;trangers of a different race from them&s;elves. In this they &s;omewhat
            re&s;emble the human inhabitants of the &s;avage nations, among whom they are
            found, where the petty kingdoms are numerous, and their manners oppo&s;ite.
            There, in the ex|tent of a few miles, the traveller is pre&s;ented with men
            &s;peaking different languages, pro|fe&s;&s;ing different religions, governed
            by different laws, and only re&s;embling each other in their mutual
            animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>In general, monkies of all kinds, being le&s;s than the baboon,
            are endued with le&s;s powers of doing mi&s;chief. Indeed, the ferocity of
            their nature &s;eems to dimini&s;h with their &s;ize; and when taken wild in
            the woods, they are &s;ooner <PB N="219" REF="289"> tamed, and more ea&s;ily
            taught to imitate man than the former. More gentle than the baboon, and le&s;s
            grave and &s;ullen than the ape, they &s;oon begin to exert all their
            &s;portive mimickries, and are ea&s;ily re&s;trained by correction. But it
            mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that they will do nothing they are de|&s;ired without
            beating; for, if their fears be entirely removed, they are the mo&s;t
            in&s;olent and head&s;trong animals in nature.</P>
<P>In their native woods they are not le&s;s the pe&s;ts of man than
            of other animals. The monkies, &s;ays a traveller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De&s;cription Hi&s;torique de Macacar, p. 51.</BIBL></NOTE>,
            are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every fore&s;t where they re&s;ide, and may be
            con|&s;idered as the ma&s;ters of the place. Neither the tiger, nor the lion
            it&s;elf, will venture to di&s;|pute the dominion, &s;ince the&s;e, from the
            tops of trees, continually carry on an offen&s;ive war, and by their agility
            e&s;cape all po&s;&s;ibility of pur|&s;uit. Nor have the birds le&s;s to fear
            from their continual depredations; for, as the&s;e harmle&s;s inhabitants of
            the wood u&s;ually build upon trees, the monkies are for ever on the watch to
            find out and rob their ne&s;ts; and &s;uch is their petulant delight in
            mi&s;chief, that they will fling their eggs again&s;t the ground when they want
            appetite or inclination to devour them.</P>
<P>There is but one animal in all the fore&s;t that 
            <PB N="220" REF="290"> ventures to oppo&s;e the monkey, and that is the
            &s;erpent. The larger &s;nakes are often &s;een winding up the trees where the
            monkies re&s;ide; and, when they happen to &s;urprize them &s;leep|ing,
            &s;wallow them whole before the little ani|mals have time to make a defence. In
            this manner, the two mo&s;t mi&s;chievous kinds in all nature keep the whole
            fore&s;t between them; both equally formidable to each other, and for ever
            employed in mutual ho&s;tilities. The monkies in general inhabit the tops of
            the trees, and the &s;erpents cling to the bran|ches nearer the bottom; and in
            this manner they are for ever &s;een near each other, like ene|mies in the
            &s;ame field of battle. Some travellers, indeed, have &s;uppo&s;ed that their
            vicinity rather argued their mutual friend&s;hip, and that they united in this
            manner to form an offen&s;ive league again&s;t all the re&s;t of animated
            nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat, Relat. del Afriq. Occident, p.

            <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een the&s;e monkies," &s;ays Labat,
              "play|ing their gambols upon tho&s;e very branches on which the &s;nakes were
              repo&s;ing, and jumping over them without receiving any injury, al|though the
              &s;erpents of that country were natu|rally vindictive, and always ready to bite
              what|ever di&s;turbed them."</Q> The&s;e gambols, however, were probably
            nothing more than the in&s;ults of <PB N="221" REF="291"> an enemy that was
            con&s;cious of its own &s;afety; and the monkies might have provoked the
            &s;nake in the &s;ame manner as we often &s;ee &s;par|rows twitter at a cat.
            However this be, the fore&s;t is generally divided between them; and the&s;e
            woods, which Nature &s;eems to have em|belli&s;hed with her riche&s;t
            magnificence, rather in&s;pire terror than delight, and chiefly &s;erve as
            retreats for mi&s;chief and malignity.</P>
<P>The enmity of the&s;e animals to mankind, is partly ridiculous,
            and partly formidable. They &s;eem, &s;ays Le Comte and others, to have a
            peculiar in&s;tinct in di&s;covering their foes; and are perfectly &s;killed,
            when attacked, in mu|tually defending and a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other. When a
            traveller enters among the&s;e woods, they con&s;ider him as an invader upon
            their domi|nions, and join all to repel the intru&s;ion. At fir&s;t they
            &s;urvey him with a kind of in&s;olent cu|rio&s;ity They jump from branch to
            branch, pur&s;ue him as he goes along, and make a loud chattering, to call the
            re&s;t of their companions together. They then begin their ho&s;tilities by
            grinning, threatening, and flinging down the withered branches at him, which
            they break from the trees: they even take their excre|ments in their hands, and
            throw them at his head. Thus they attend him wherever he goes; 
            <PB N="222" REF="292"> jumping from tree to tree with &s;uch amazing
            &s;wiftne&s;s, that the eye can &s;carce attend their motions. Although they
            take the mo&s;t de&s;|perate leaps, yet they are &s;eldom &s;een to come to the
            ground, for they ea&s;ily fa&s;ten upon the branches that break their fall, and
            &s;tick, either by their hands, feet, or tail, wherever they touch. If one of
            them happens to be wounded, the re&s;t a&s;&s;emble round, and clap their
            fingers into the wound, as if they were de&s;irous of &s;ounding its depth. If
            the blood flows in any quantity, &s;ome of them keep it &s;hut up, while others
            get leaves, which they chew, and thru&s;t into the opening: however
            extraordinary this may appear, it is a&s;&s;erted to be often &s;een, and to be
            &s;trictly true. In this manner they wage a pe|tulant, unequal war; and are
            often killed in numbers before they think proper to make a retreat. This they
            effect with the &s;ame preci|pitation with which they at fir&s;t came together.
            In this retreat the young are &s;een clinging to the back of the female, with
            which &s;he jumps away, &s;eemingly unembarra&s;&s;ed by the burthen.</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of the Europeans has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, induced
            the natives of the places where the&s;e animals re&s;ide, to catch or take them
            alive by every art they are able. The <PB N="223" REF="293"> u&s;ual way in
            &s;uch ca&s;e, is to &s;hoot the female as &s;he carries her young, and then
            both, of cour&s;e, tumble to the ground. But even this is not ea&s;ily
            performed; for if the animal be not killed outright, it will not fall; but
            clinging to &s;ome branch, continues, even when dead, its former gra&s;p, and
            remains on the tree where it was &s;hot, until it drops off by putrefaction: In
            this manner it is totally lo&s;t to the pur&s;uer; for to attempt climbing the
            tree, to bring either it or the young one down, would probably be fatal, from
            the number of &s;erpents that are hid among the branches. For this rea&s;on the
            &s;port&s;man always takes care to aim at the head; which, if he hits, the
            monkey falls directly to the ground; and the young one comes down at the &s;ame
            time, clinging to its dead parent.</P>
<P>The Europeans along the coa&s;ts of Guniea, often go into the
            woods to &s;hoot monkies; and nothing plea&s;es the Negroes more than to &s;ee
            tho&s;e animals drop, again&s;t which they have the greate&s;t animo&s;ity.
            They con&s;ider them, and not without rea&s;on, as the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous and
            tormenting creatures in the world; and are happy to &s;ee their numbers
            de&s;troyed, upon a double account; as well becau&s;e they dread their
            deva&s;tations, as becau&s;e they love their fle&s;h. The monkey, which is
            always &s;kinned <PB N="224" REF="294"> before it is eaten, when &s;erved up at
            a Negroe fea&s;t, looks, &s;o like a child, that an European is &s;hocked at
            the very &s;ight. The natives, however, who are not &s;o nice, devour it as one
            of the highe&s;t delicacies; and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attend our &s;port&s;men, to
            profit by the &s;poil. But what they are chiefly a&s;toni&s;hed at, is to &s;ee
            our tra|vellers carefully taking the young ones alive, while they leave them
            the old ones, that are certainly the mo&s;t fit to be eaten. They cannot
            comprehend what advantage can ari&s;e to us from educating or keeping a little
            animal, that, by experience, they know to be equally fraught with tricks and
            mi&s;chief: &s;ome of them have even been led to &s;uppo&s;e, that, with a kind
            of perver&s;e affection, we love only creatures of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous
            kinds; and having &s;een us often buy young and tame monkies, they have taken
            equal care to bring rats to our factors, offering them for &s;ale, and greatly

<P>The Negroes con&s;ider the&s;e animals as their greate&s;t plague;
            and, indeed, they do incre|dible damage, when they come in companies to lay
            wa&s;te a field of Indian corn or rice, or a plantation of &s;ugar-canes. They
            carry off as <PB N="225" REF="295"> much as they are able; and they de&s;troy
            ten times more than they bear away. Their manner of plundering is pretty much
            like that of the baboons, already mentioned, in a garden. One of them &s;tands
            centinel upon a tree, while the re&s;t are plundering, carefully and
            cautiou&s;ly turning on every &s;ide, but particularly to that on which there
            is the greate&s;t danger: in the mean time, the re&s;t of the &s;poilers
            pur&s;ue their work with great &s;ilence and a&s;&s;iduity; they are not
            contented with the fir&s;t blade of corn, or the fir&s;t cane that they happen
            to lay their hands on: they fir&s;t pull up &s;uch as appear mo&s;t alluring to
            the eye: they turn it round, examine, compare it with others, and if they find
            it to their mind, &s;tick it under one of their &s;houlders. When in this
            manner they have got their load, they begin to think of re|treating: but if it
            &s;hould happen that the owners of the field appear to interrupt their
            depredations, their faithful centinel in&s;tantly gives notice, by crying out,
            <HI>houp, houp, houp</HI>; which the re&s;t perfectly under&s;tand, and all at
            once throwing down the corn they hold in the left hands, &s;camper off upon
            three legs, carrying the remainder in the right. If they are &s;till hotly
            pur&s;ued, they then are content to throw down their whole burthen, and to take
            refuge <PB N="226" REF="296"> among their woods, on the tops of which they
            remain in perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Were we to give faith to what &s;ome travellers a&s;&s;ure us, of
            the government, policies, and &s;ubordination of the&s;e animals, we might
            per|haps be taxed with credulity; but we have no rea&s;on to doubt that they
            are under a kind of di&s;cipline, which they exerci&s;e among each other. They
            are generally &s;een to keep together in com|panies, to march in exact order,
            and to obey the voice of &s;ome particular chieftain, remark|able for his
            &s;ize and gravity. One &s;pecies of the&s;e, which Mr. Buffon calls the
            Ouarine, and which are remarkable for the loudne&s;s and the di&s;tinctne&s;s
            of their voice, are &s;till more &s;o for the u&s;e to which they convert it. 
            <Q REND="inline">"I have fre|quently been a witne&s;s," &s;ays
              Morgrave, "of their a&s;&s;emblies and deliberations. Every day, both morning
              and evening, the ouarines a&s;|&s;emble in the woods to receive in&s;tructions.
              When all come together, one among the num|ber takes the highe&s;t place on a
              tree, and makes a &s;ignal with his hand to the re&s;t to &s;it round, in order
              to hearken. As &s;oon as he &s;ees them placed, he begins his di&s;cour&s;e,
              with &s;o loud a voice, and yet in a manner &s;o precipitate, that to hear him
              at a di&s;tance, one would think the whole company were crying out at the
              &s;ame <PB N="227" REF="297"> time: however, during that time, one only is
              &s;peaking; and all the re&s;t ob&s;erve the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence. When
              this has done, he makes a &s;ign with the hand for the re&s;t to reply; and at
              that in&s;tant they rai&s;e their voices to|gether, until by another &s;ignal
              of the hand they are enjoined &s;ilence. This they as readily obey; till, at
              la&s;t, the whole a&s;&s;embly breaks up, after hearing a repetition of the
              &s;ame preachment."</Q></P>
<P>The chief food of the monkey-tribe is fruits, the buds of trees,
            or &s;ucculent roots and plants. They all, like man, &s;eem fond of &s;weets;
            and particularly the plea&s;ant juice of the palm-tree, and the &s;ugar cane.
            With the&s;e the fertile regions in which they are bred, &s;eldom fail to
            &s;upply them; but when it happens that the&s;e fail, or that more nouri&s;hing
            food becomes more agreeable, they eat in&s;ects and worms; and, &s;ometimes, if
            near the coa&s;ts, de&s;cend to the &s;ea-&s;hore, where they eat oy&s;ters,
            crabs, and &s;hell fi&s;h. Their manner of managing an oy&s;ter is
            extraordinary enough; but it is too well atte&s;ted, to fail of our a&s;&s;ent.
            As the oy&s;ters in the tropical climates are generally larger than with us,
            the monkies, when they go to the &s;ea-&s;ide pick up a &s;tone, and clap it
            between the opening &s;hells: this prevents them <PB N="228" REF="298"> from
            clo&s;ing; and the monkey then eats the fi&s;h at his ea&s;e. They often al&s;o
            draw crabs from the water, by putting their tail to the hole where that animal
            takes refuge, and the crab fa&s;tening upon it, they withdraw it with a jerk,
            and thus pull their prey upon &s;hore. This habit of laying traps for other
            animals, makes them very cautious of being entrapped them|&s;elves; and I am
            a&s;&s;ured, by many per&s;ons of credit, that no &s;nare, how nicely baited
            &s;oever, will take the monkey of the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands; for having been
            accu&s;tomed to the cunning of man, it oppo&s;es its natural di&s;tru&s;t to
            human artifice.</P>
<P>The monkey generally brings forth one at a time, and &s;ometimes
            two. They are rarely found to breed when brought over into Europe; but of
            tho&s;e that do, they exhibit a very &s;triking picture of parental affection.
            The male and female are never tired of fondling their young one. They
            in&s;truct it with no little a&s;&s;iduity; and often &s;everely correct it, if
            &s;tubborn, or di&s;|inclined to profit by their example: they hand it from one
            to the other; and when the male has done &s;hewing his regard, the female takes
            her turn. When wild in the woods, the fe|male, if &s;he happens to have two,
            carries one on her back, and the other in her arms: that <PB N="229" REF="299">
            on her back clings very clo&s;ely, cla&s;ping its hands round her neck, and its
            feet about her middle; when &s;he wants to &s;uckle it, &s;he then alters their
            po&s;ition; and that which has been fed gives place to the other, which &s;he
            takes in her arms. It often happens that &s;he is un|able to leap from one tree
            to another, when thus loaden; and upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, their dexterity is
            very &s;urprizing. The whole family form a kind of chain, locking tail in tail,
            or hand in hand, and one of them holding the branch above, the re&s;t &s;wing
            down, balancing to and fro, like a pendulum, until the under|mo&s;t is enabled
            to catch hold of the lower branches of &s;ome neighbouring tree. When the hold
            is fixed below, the monkey lets go that which was above, and thus comes
            under|mo&s;t in turn; but, creeping up along the chain, attains the next
            branches, like the re&s;t; and thus they all take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
            tree, without ever coming to the ground.</P>
<P>When in a &s;tate of dome&s;tic tamene&s;s, tho&s;e animals are
            very amu&s;ing, and often fill up a vacant hour, when other entertainment is
            want|ing. There are few that are not acquainted with their various mimickries,
            and their ca|pricious feats of activity. But it is generally in company with
            other animals of a more &s;imple <PB N="230" REF="300"> di&s;po&s;ition that
            their tricks and &s;uperior in|&s;tincts are &s;hewn; they &s;eem to take a
            delight in tormenting them; and I have &s;een one of them amu&s;ing it&s;elf
            for hours together, in im|po&s;ing upon the gravity of a cat. Era&s;mus tells
            us of a large monkey, kept by Sir Thomas More, that, one day diverting it&s;elf
            in his garden, where &s;ome tame rabbits were kept, played &s;everal of its
            u&s;ual pranks among them, while the rabbits &s;carce well knew what to make of
            their new acquaintance: in the mean time, a wea&s;el, that came for very
            different purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of entertainment, was &s;een peering about
            the place in which the rabbits were fed, and endeavouring to make its way, by
            removing a board that clo&s;ed their hutch. While the monkey &s;aw no danger,
            it continued a calm &s;pectator of the enemy's efforts; but ju&s;t when, by
            long labour, the wea&s;el had effected its purpo&s;e, and had removed the
            board, the monkey &s;tept in, and, with, the utmo&s;t dexte|rity, fa&s;tened it
            again in its place; and the di&s;|appointed wea&s;el was too much fatigued to
            renew its operations. To this I will only add what Father Carli, in his
            hi&s;tory of An|gola a&s;&s;ures us to be true. In that horrid country, where
            he went to convert the &s;avage natives to Chri&s;tianity, and met with nothing
            <PB N="231" REF="301"> but di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;appointment; while his health
            was totally impaired by the raging heats of the climate, his patience
            exhau&s;ted by the ob&s;tinacy of the &s;tupid natives, and his little
            provi&s;ions daily plundered, without redre&s;s, in &s;uch an exigency he found
            more faithful &s;ervices from the monkies than the men; the&s;e he had taught
            to attend him, to guard him, while &s;leep|ing, again&s;t thieves and rats, to
            comb his head, to fetch his water; and, he a&s;&s;erts, that they were even
            more tractable than the human inhabitants of the place. It is indeed
            remarkable, that in tho&s;e countries where the men are mo&s;t bar|barous and
            &s;tupid, the brutes are mo&s;t active and &s;agacious. It is in the torrid
            tracts, in|habited by Barbarians, that &s;uch various animals are found with
            in&s;tincts &s;o nearly approaching rea&s;on. The &s;avages both of Africa and
            Ame|rica, accordingly &s;uppo&s;e monkies to be men; idle, &s;lothful, rational
            beings; capable of &s;peech and conver&s;ation; but ob&s;tinately dumb, for
            fear of being compelled to labour.</P>
<P>As of all &s;avages, tho&s;e of Africa are the mo&s;t brutal,
            &s;o, of all countries, the monkies of Africa are the mo&s;t expert and
            entertaining. The monkies of America are, in general, neither &s;o &s;agacious
            nor &s;o tractable, nor is their form &s;o nearly approaching that of man. 
            <PB N="232" REF="302"> The monkies of the new continent, may be very ea&s;ily
            di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the old, by three marks. Tho&s;e of the
            ancient conti|nent are univer&s;ally found to have a naked callous
            &s;ub&s;tance behind, upon which they &s;it; which tho&s;e of America are
            entirely without; tho&s;e al&s;o of the ancient continent have the no&s;trils
            differently formed, more re&s;embling tho&s;e of men, the holes opening
            downward; whereas the American monkies have them opening on each &s;ide;
            tho&s;e of the ancient world, have pouches on each &s;ide the jaw, into which
            they put their provi&s;ions, which tho&s;e of America are without: la&s;tly,
            none of the monkies of the ancient continent hang by the tail, which many of
            the American &s;orts are known to do. By the&s;e marks the monkies of either
            continent, may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, and prized
            accordingly. The African monkey, as I am a&s;&s;ured, requires a longer
            education, and more correction, than that of America; but it is at la&s;t found
            ca|pable of more various powers of imitation; and &s;hews a greater degree of
            cunning and activity.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon, who has examined this race of imitative beings, with
            greater accuracy than any other naturali&s;t before him, makes but 
            <PB N="233" REF="303"> nine &s;pecies of monkies belonging to the ancient
            continent; and eleven belonging to the new. To all the&s;e he gives the names
            which they go by, in their re&s;pective countries; which, un|doubtedly, is the
            method lea&s;t liable to error, and the mo&s;t proper for imitation.</P>
<P>Of the monkies of the ancient continent, the fir&s;t, he
            de&s;cribes, is the Macaguo; &s;ome|what re&s;embling a baboon in &s;ize,
            &s;trength of body, and an hideous wrinkled vi&s;age: it differs, however, in
            having a very long tail, which is covered with tufted hair. It is a native of
            Congo.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the Patas, which is about the &s;ame &s;ize with
            the former; but differs, in hav|ing a longer body, and a face le&s;s hideous;
            it is particularly remarkable for the colour of its hair, which is of a red,
            &s;o brilliant, that the animal looks as if it were actually painted. It is
            u&s;ually brought from Senegal; and by &s;ome, called the Red African
            Monkey.</P>
<P>The third of the ancient continent is the Malbrouk; of which he
            &s;uppo&s;es the monkey which he calls the Bonet Chinois to be a variety. The
            one is remarkable for a long tail, and long beard; the other, for a cap of
            hair, that covers the crown of the head, from whence it takes the name. Both
            are natives of the Ea&s;t Indies; <PB N="234" REF="304"> and the Bramins, who
            extend their charity to all the brute creation, have ho&s;pitals for &s;uch of
            them as happen to be &s;ick, or otherwi&s;e di&s;abled.</P>
<P>The fourth of this kind, is the Mangabey; this may be
            di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, by its eye-lids, which are naked, and of a
            &s;triking whitene&s;s. It is a native of Madaga&s;car.</P>
<P>The fifth is the Mona, or the Cephus of the ancients: it is
            di&s;tingui&s;hed by its colour, which is variegated with black and red; and
            its tail is of an a&s;h-colour, with two white &s;pots on each &s;ide, at its
            in&s;ertion. It is a native of the northern parts of Africa.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth is the Callitrix, or Green Monkey of St. I&auml;go;
            di&s;tingui&s;hed by its beautiful green colour on the back, its white brea&s;t
            and belly, and its black face.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh is the Mou&s;toc, or White No&s;e; di&s;tingui&s;hed
            by the whitene&s;s of its lips, from whence it has received its name, the
            re&s;t of the face being of a deep blue. It is a native of the Gold Coa&s;t,
            and a very beautiful little animal.</P>
<P>The eighth is the Talapoin; and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed as well
            by its beautiful variety of green, white, and yellow hair, as by that under the
            eyes, being of a greater length than the re&s;t. <PB N="235" REF="305"> It is
            &s;uppo&s;ed to be a native of Africa and the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The ninth and la&s;t of the monkies of the ancient continent, is
            the Douc, &s;o called in Co|chinchina, of which country it is a native. The
            douc &s;eems to unite the characters of all the former together: with a long
            tail, like the monkey; of a &s;ize as large as the baboon; and with a flat
            face, like the ape: it even re&s;embles the American monkies, in having no
            callous on its po&s;teriors. Thus it &s;eems to form the &s;hade by which the
            monkies of one continent are linked with tho&s;e of the other.</P>
<P>Next come the monkies of the new continent; which, as hath been
            &s;aid, differ from tho&s;e of the old, in the make of their no&s;trils, in
            their having no callo&s;ity on their po&s;teriors, and in their having no
            pouches on each &s;ide of the jaw. They differ al&s;o from each other, a part
            of them making no u&s;e of their tails to hang by; while others of them have
            the tail very &s;trong and mu&s;cular, and &s;erving by way of a fifth hand to
            hold by. Tho&s;e with mu&s;cular holding tails, are called Sapajous; tho&s;e
            with feeble, u&s;ele&s;s tails, are called Sagoins. Of the &s;apa|jous there
            are five &s;orts: of the &s;agoins there are &s;ix.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the &s;apajous is the Warine, or 
            <PB N="236" REF="306"> the Brazilian Guariba. This monkey is as large as a fox,
            with black long hair, and re|markable for the loudne&s;s of its voice. It is
            the large&s;t of the monkey kind to be found in America.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the Coaiti; which may be di&s;tingtui&s;hed from
            the re&s;t, by having no thumb, and, con&s;equently, but four fingers on the
            two fore paws. The tail, however, &s;upplies the defects of the hand; and with
            this the animal &s;lings it&s;elf from one tree to another, with &s;ur|prizing
            rapidity.</P>
<P>The third is the Sajou; di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the
            &s;apajous, by its yellowi&s;h, fle&s;h-coloured face.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Sai. It is &s;omewhat larger than the &s;ajou,
            and has a broader muzzle. It is called al&s;o the Bewailer; from its peculiar
            manner of lamenting, when either threatened or beaten.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t of the &s;apajou kind, or monkies that hold
            by the tail, is the Samiri, or Aurora; which is the &s;malle&s;t and the mo&s;t
            beautiful of all. It is of a fine orange colour, with two circles of fle&s;h
            round the eyes. It is a very tender, delicate animal, and held in high
            price.</P>
<P>Of the &s;agoins with feeble tails, there are &s;ix 
            <PB N="237" REF="307"> kinds. The fir&s;t and the large&s;t, is the Saki, or
            Cagui; &s;o remarkable for the length of the hair on its tail, that it has been
            often termed the Fox-Tailed Monkey. It is of different &s;izes; &s;ome being
            twice as large as others.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of this kind is the Tamaim; which is u&s;ually black,
            with the feet yellow. Some, however, are found all over brown, &s;potted with
            yellow.</P>
<P>The third is the Wi&s;titi; remarkable for the large tufts of hair
            upon its face, and its annulated tail.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Marikina; with a mane round the neck, and a
            bunch of hair at the end of the tail, like a lion.</P>
<P>The fifth is called the Pinch; with the face of a beautiful black,
            and white hair that de|&s;cends on each &s;ide of the face, like that of
            man.</P>
<P>The la&s;t, lea&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful of all, is the Mico, an
            animal too curiou&s;ly adorned, not to demand a particular de&s;cription; which
            is thus given of it, by Mr. Condamine. 
            <Q REND="inline">"That," &s;ays he, "which the governor of Para
              made me a pre&s;ent of, was the only one of its kind that was &s;een in the
              country. The hair on its body was of a beautiful &s;ilver colour, brighter than
              that of the mo&s;t venerable human hair: <PB N="238" REF="308"> while the tail
              was of a deep brown, inclining to blackne&s;s. It had another &s;ingularity,
              more remarkable than the former; its ears, its cheeks, and lips, were tinctured
              with &s;o bright a vermil|lion, that one could &s;carce be led to &s;uppo&s;e
              that it was natural. I kept it a year; and it was &s;till alive when I made
              this de&s;cription of it, almo&s;t within &s;ight of the coa&s;ts of France:
              all I could then do, was to pre&s;erve it in &s;pirits of wine, which might
              &s;erve to keep it in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to &s;hew that I did not in the
              lea&s;t exaggerate in my de&s;cription."</Q></P>

<HEAD>OF THE MAKI.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t of the monkey kind are the Makies; which have no other
            preten&s;ions to be placed in this cla&s;s, except that of having hands like
            the former, and making u&s;e of them to climb trees, or to pluck their food.
            Animals of the hare kind, indeed, are often &s;een to feed them&s;elves with
            their fore paws, but they can hold nothing in one of them &s;ingly, and are
            obliged to take up whatever they eat in both at once: but it is otherwi&s;e
            with the maki; as well as the monkey kinds, they &s;eize their food with one
            hand, pretty much like a man, and gra&s;p it with great ea&s;e and firmne&s;s.

            conformation in its hands, both before and behind, approaches nearly to the

            form of the ears, and the parts that di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes, it entirely
            differs from them. There are many different kinds of the&s;e animals; all
            varying from each other in colour or &s;ize, but agreeing in the human-like
            figure of their hands and feet, and in their long no&s;e, which &s;ome|what
            re&s;embles that of a dog. As mo&s;t of the&s;e are bred in the depths of the
            fore&s;t, we know little more concerning them than their figure. Their way of
            living, their power of pur&s;uit and e&s;cape, can only be &s;uppo&s;ed, from
            the analogy of their conformation, &s;omewhat to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the
            monkey.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of this kind is the Mococo; a beautiful animal, about
            the &s;ize of a common cat, but the body and limbs &s;lenderer, and of a longer
            make. It has a very long tail, at lea&s;t double the length of its body; it is
            covered with fur, and marked alternately with broad rings of black and white.
            But what it is chiefly remarkable for, be&s;ides the form of its hands and
            feet, is the largene&s;s of its eyes, which are &s;urrounded with a broad black
            &s;pace; and the length of the hinder legs, which by far exceed <PB REF="311">

            before. When it &s;leeps, it brings its no&s;e to its belly, and its tail over
            its head. When it plays, it u&s;es a &s;ort of galloping, with its tail
            rai&s;ed over its back, which keeps continually in motion. The head is covered
            with dark a&s;h-coloured hair; the back and &s;ides, with a red a&s;h-colour,
            and not &s;o dark as on the head; and the whole, glo&s;&s;y, &s;oft and
            de|licate, &s;mooth to the touch, and &s;tanding al|mo&s;t upright, like the
            pile of velvet. It is a native of Madaga&s;car; appears to be an harm|le&s;s
            gentle animal; and though it re&s;embles the monkey in many re&s;pects, it has
            neither its ma|lice nor its mi&s;chief: neverthele&s;s, like the monkey, it
            &s;eems to be always in motion; and moves, like all four-handed animals, in an
            oblique direction.</P>
<P>A &s;econd of this kind, which is al&s;o a native of Madaga&s;car,
            is the Mongooz; which is le&s;s than the former; with a &s;oft, glo&s;&s;y
            robe, but a little curled. The no&s;e al&s;o is thicker than that of the
            mococo; the eyes are black, with orange-coloured circles round the pupil; and
            the tail is of one uniform colour. As to the re&s;t, it is found of various
            colours; &s;ome being black, others brown; and its actions &s;ome|what
            re&s;emble tho&s;e of a monkey.</P>
<P>The Vari is much larger than either of the <PB N="241" REF="314">
            former; its hair is much longer, and it has a kind of ruff round the neck,
            con&s;i&s;ting of very long hair, by which it may be ea&s;ily
            di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t. It differs al&s;o in its di&s;|po&s;ition,
            which is fierce and &s;avage; as al&s;o in the loudne&s;s of its voice, which
            &s;omewhat re|&s;embles the roaring of the lion. This al&s;o is a native of
            Madaga&s;car.</P>
<P>To this tribe we may refer a little four-handed animal, of the
            i&s;land of Ceylon, which Mr. Buffon calls the Lori; very remarkable for the
            &s;ingularity of its figure. This is, of all other animals, the longe&s;t, in
            proportion to its &s;ize; having nine vertebrae in the loins; whereas other
            quadrupedes have only &s;even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvi.
                p. 274.</BIBL></NOTE>. The body appears &s;till the longer, by having no tail.
            In other re&s;pects, it re&s;embles tho&s;e of the maki kind; as well in its
            hands and feet, as in its &s;nout, and in the glo&s;&s;y qualities of its hair.
            It is about the &s;ize of a &s;quirrel; and appears to be a tame, harmle&s;s

<HEAD>OF THE OPPOSSUM, AND ITS KINDS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the&s;e four-handed animals of the an|cient continent, we may
            add the four-handed <PB N="242" REF="315"> animals of the new, that u&s;e their
            hands like the former, as well as their tails, and that fill up the cha&s;m
            between the monkey tribe and the lower orders of the fore&s;t. As the maki kind

            &s;ize, &s;o the&s;e &s;eem to unite the monkey and the rat. They are all
            le&s;s than the former; they have long tails, almo&s;t bare of hair; and their
            fur, as well as their &s;hape, &s;eems to place them near the rat kind. Some
            have accordingly ranked them in that cla&s;s; but their being four-handed, is a
            &s;ufficient rea&s;on for placing them in the rear of the monkies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and the mo&s;t remarkable of this tribe is the
            Oppo&s;&s;um, an animal found both in North and South America, of the &s;ize of
            a &s;mall cat. The head re&s;embles that of a fox; it has fifty teeth in all;
            but two great ones in the mid&s;t, like tho&s;e of a rat. The eyes are little,
            round, clear, lively, and placed upright; the ears are long, broad, and
            tran&s;parent, like tho&s;e of the rat kind; its tail al&s;o encrea&s;es the
            &s;imilitude, being round, long, a little hairy in the beginning, but quite
            naked towards the end. The fore legs are &s;hort, being about three inches
            long; while tho&s;e behind are about four. The feet are like hands, each having

            toes or fingers, with white crooked nails, and rather longer behind than
            before. But it is particular in this animal, that the thumb on the hinder legs
            wants a nail; whereas the fingers are furni&s;hed with clawed nails as
            u&s;ual.</P>
<P>But that which di&s;tingui&s;hes this animal from all others, and
            what has excited the wonder of mankind for more than two centuries, is the
            extraordinary conformation of its belly, as it is found to have a fal&s;e womb,
            into which the young, when brought forth in the u&s;ual manner, creep, and
            continue for &s;ome days longer, to lodge and &s;uckle &s;ecurely. This bag, if
            we may &s;o call it, being one of the mo&s;t extraor|dinary things in natural
            hi&s;tory, requires a more minute de&s;cription. Under the belly of the female
            is a kind of &s;lit or opening, of about three inches long; this opening is
            compo&s;ed of a &s;kin, which makes a bag internally, which is covered on the
            in&s;ide with hair, and in this bag are the teats of the female; and into it
            the young, when brought forth, retire, either to &s;uckle or to e&s;cape from
            danger. This bag has a power of opening and &s;hutting, at the will of the
            ani|mal; and this is performed by means of &s;everal mu&s;cles, and two bones,
            that are fitted for this purpo&s;e, and that are peculiar to this ani|mal 
            <PB N="244" REF="320"> only. The&s;e two bones are placed before the os pubis,
            to which they are joined at the ba&s;e; they are about two inches long, and
            grow &s;maller and &s;maller to their extremities. The&s;e &s;upport the
            mu&s;cles that &s;erve to open the bag, and give them a fixture To the&s;e
            mu&s;cles there are antagoni&s;ts, that &s;erve, in the &s;ame manner, to
            &s;hut the bag; and this they perform &s;o ex|actly, that in the living animal
            the opening can &s;carce be di&s;cerned, except when the &s;ides are forcibly
            drawn a&s;under. The in&s;ide of this bag is furni&s;hed with glands, that
            ex&s;ude a mu&s;ky &s;ub&s;tance, which communicates to the fle&s;h of the
            animal, and renders, it unfit to be eaten. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that
            this is the place where the young are conceived, as &s;ome have been led to
            imagine; for the oppo&s;&s;um has another womb, like that of the generality of
            animals, in which generation is performed in the ordinary manner. The bag we
            have been de&s;cribing, may rather be con&s;idered as a &s;up|plemental womb.
            In the real womb, the little animal is partly brought to perfection; in the
            ordinary one, it receives a kind of additional, incubation; and acquires, at
            la&s;t, &s;trength enough to follow the dam wherever &s;he goes. We have many
            rea&s;ons to &s;uppo&s;e that the <PB N="245" REF="321"> young of this animal
            are all brought forth pre|maturely, or before they have acquired that degree of
            perfection, which is common in other quadrupedes. The little ones, when fir&s;t
            produced, are in a manner but half com|pleted; and &s;ome travellers
            a&s;&s;ert, that they are, at that time, not much larger than flies. We are
            a&s;&s;ured al&s;o, that immediately on quitting the real womb, they creep into
            the fal&s;e one; where they continue fixed to the teat, until they have
            &s;trength &s;ufficient to venture once more into the open air, and &s;hare the
            fatigues of the parent. Ulloa a&s;&s;ures us, that he has found five of the&s;e
            little creatures hidden in the belly of the dam three days after &s;he was
            dead, &s;till alive, and all clinging to the teat with great avidity. It is
            probable, therefore, that upon their fir&s;t entering the fal&s;e womb, they
            &s;eldom &s;tir out from thence; but when more advanced, they venture forth
            &s;everal times in the day; and, at la&s;t, &s;eldom make u&s;e of their
            retreat, except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity or danger. Travellers are not
            agreed in their accounts of the time which the&s;e animals take to continue in
            the fal&s;e womb; &s;ome a&s;&s;ure us, they remain there for &s;everal weeks;
            and others, more preci&s;ely mention a month. During this <PB N="246" REF="322"> period of &s;trange ge&s;tation, there is no dif|ficulty in opening
            the bag in which they are concealed; they may be reckoned, examined, and
            handled, without much inconvenience; for they keep fixed to the teat, and cling
            there as firm as if they made a part of the body of the animal that bears them.
            When they are grown &s;tronger, they drop from the teat into the bag in which
            they are contained; and, at la&s;t, find their way out, in &s;earch of more
            copious &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Still, however, the fal&s;e belly &s;erves them for
            a retreat; either when they want to &s;leep or to &s;uckle, or when they are
            pur&s;ued by an enemy. The dam, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, opens her bag to receive
            them, which they enter,

            incapacity of running with any degree of &s;wiftne&s;s: but, to counterbalance
            this inconvenience, it climbs trees with great ea&s;e and expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxi. p. 174.</BIBL></NOTE>. It chiefly
            &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon birds; and hides among the leaves of the trees, to &s;eize
            them by &s;urprize. It often al&s;o hangs by the tail, which is long and 
            <PB N="247" REF="323"> mu&s;cular; and, in this &s;ituation, for hours
            to|gether, with the head downwards, it keeps watching for its prey. If any
            le&s;&s;er animal, which it is able to overcome, pa&s;&s;es underneath, it
            drops upon it with deadly aim, and quickly devours it. By means of its tail,
            the oppo&s;&s;um al&s;o &s;lings from one tree to another, hunts in|&s;ects,
            e&s;capes its pur&s;uers, and provides for its &s;afety. It &s;eems to be a
            creature that lives upon vegetables, as well as animal &s;ub&s;tances, roots,
            &s;ugar-canes, the bark, and even the leaves of trees. It is ea&s;ily tamed,
            but it is a di&s;agree|able dome&s;tic, as well from its &s;tupidity and
            figure, as its &s;cent, which, however fragrant in &s;mall quantities, fails
            not to be ungrateful when copiou&s;ly &s;upplied.</P>
<P>An animal greatly re&s;embling the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxi. p. 212.</BIBL></NOTE>, is the Marmo&s;e,
            which is found in the &s;ame continent. It &s;eems only to differ in &s;ize,
            be|ing le&s;s; and, in&s;tead of a bag to receive its young, has only two
            longitudinal folds near the thighs, within which, the young, which are
            prematurely brought forth, as in the la&s;t in|&s;tance, continue to &s;uckle.
            The young of the&s;e, when fir&s;t produced, are not above the &s;ize of a
            bean; but continue &s;ticking to the <PB N="248" REF="324"> teat, until they
            have arrived at greater matu|rity.</P>
<P>The Cayopolin is &s;omewhat larger than the former; and a good
            deal re&s;embling it in habits and figure, except that its &s;nout is more
            pointed, its tail longer in proportion, and its colour different, being of an
            a&s;h, &s;omewhat inclining to yellow; however, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it to be
            only a variety of the former.</P>
<P>To this number we may add the Phalanger, &s;o called by Mr.
            Buffon; a good deal re&s;embling the former, but di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
            fa&s;hion of its hinder hands: the thumb and the fore finger being joined
            together, except at the extremities. This animal is about the &s;ize of a rat;
            and has, accordingly, by &s;ome, been called the Rat of Surinam.</P>
<P>The la&s;t animal of this cla&s;s is called, by Mr. Buffon, the
            Tar&s;ier. This extraordinary little animal re&s;embles the former, in having
            four hands, and a long tail; but it differs very much in the extreme length of
            its hinder legs, which are longer than the re&s;t of its whole body. The bones
            of that part of the foot called the Tar&s;us, are likewi&s;e &s;o very long,
            that from thence the animal has received its name: the tail is naked in the
            middle, and hairy only at both extre|mities: <PB REF="325">

            animal was brought; but the naturali&s;t from whom we have its de&s;cription,
            &s;uppo&s;es it to be a native of America.</P>
<P>From this general de&s;cription of four-handed animals, we
            perceive what few advantages the brute creation derive from tho&s;e organs
            that, in man, are employed to &s;o many great and u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The
            being able to pluck their food from the trees, the capacity of clinging among
            the branches, or at mo&s;t of converting one of tho&s;e branches into a weapon
            of offence, are the highe&s;t &s;tretches of their &s;agacity, and the only
            u&s;e their hands have hitherto been em|ployed in: and yet, &s;ome
            &s;uperficial men have a&s;&s;erted, that the hands alone are &s;ufficient to
            vindicate the dominion of mankind over other animals; and that much of his
            boa&s;ted rea&s;on, is nothing more than the re&s;ult of his happier
            conformation: however, were this &s;o, an ape or a monkey would in &s;ome
            in&s;tances be more ra|tional than we; their fingers are &s;maller, and, in
            &s;ome of them, more finely formed than ours. To what a variety of purpo&s;es
            might they not be employed, if their powers were properly ex|erted! Tho&s;e
            works which we, from the large|ne&s;s <PB N="250" REF="330"> of our fingers,
            are obliged to go clum&s;ily about, one of the&s;e could very ea&s;ily perform
            with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s; and if the finene&s;s of the hand a&s;&s;i&s;ted
            rea&s;on, an ape would be one of the mo&s;t rea&s;onable beings in the
            creation. But the&s;e admirably formed machines, are almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s both
            to mankind and them&s;elves; and contribute little more to the happine&s;s of
            animal life, than the paws of the lowe&s;t qua|drupede. They are &s;upplied,
            indeed, with the organs; but they want the mind, to put them into action: it is
            that rea&s;oning principle alone, with which man has been endowed, that can
            adapt &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite cau&s;es, to concur in the &s;ame general
            de&s;ign; and even where the organs are deficient, that can &s;upply their
            place, by the intervention of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in&s;truments. Where rea&s;on
            prevails, we find that it &s;carcely matters what the organs are that give it
            the di|rection; the being furni&s;hed with that principle, &s;till goes
            forward, &s;teadily and uniformly &s;uc|ce&s;sful; breaks through every
            ob&s;tacle, and becomes ma&s;ter of every enterprize. I have &s;een a man,
            without hands or legs, convert, by practice, his very &s;tumps to the mo&s;t
            conve|nient purpo&s;es; and with the&s;e clum&s;y in&s;tru|ments, perform the
            mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing feats of <PB N="251" REF="331"> dexterity. We may
            therefore, conclude, that it is the mind alone that gives a ma&s;ter to the
            creation; and that, if a bear or an hor&s;e were endowed with the &s;ame
            intelects that have been given to man, the hardne&s;s of an hoof, or the
            aukwardne&s;s of a paw, would be no ob&s;tacle to their advancement in the arts

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Elephant.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through the de&s;cription of tho&s;e quadrupedes that,
          by re&s;embling each other in &s;ome &s;triking particular, admit of being
          grouped together and con&s;idered under one point of view, we now come to
          tho&s;e in&s;ulated &s;orts that bear no &s;imilitude with the re&s;t, and that
          to be di&s;tinctly de&s;cribed mu&s;t be &s;eparately con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t of the&s;e, and in every re&s;pect the noble&s;t
          quadrupede in nature, is the ele|phant, not le&s;s remarkable for its &s;ize
          than its docility and under&s;tanding. All hi&s;torians con|cur in giving it
          the character of the mo&s;t &s;aga|cious animal next to man; and yet, were we
          to take our idea of its capacity from its outward appearance, we &s;hould be
          led to conceive very meanly of its abilities. The elephant, at fir&s;t view,
          pre&s;ents the &s;pectator with an enormous ma&s;s of fle&s;h that &s;eems
          &s;carcely animated. Its huge body, covered with a callous hide, with|out hair;
          its large mi&s;-&s;hapen legs, that &s;eem &s;carcely formed for motion; its
          little eyes, large ears, and long trunk; all give it an air of ex|treme
          &s;tupidity. But our prejudices will &s;oon <PB REF="333">

          &s;ub&s;ide when we come to examine its hi&s;tory; they will even &s;erve to
          encrea&s;e our &s;urprize when we con&s;ider the various advantages it derives
          from &s;o clum&s;y a conformation.</P>
<P>The elephant is &s;een from &s;even to no le&s;s than fifteen feet
          high. Whatever care we take to imagine a large animal beforehand, yet the
          fir&s;t &s;ight of this huge creature never fails to &s;trike us with
          a&s;toni&s;hment, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to exceed our idea. Having been
          u&s;ed to &s;maller animals, we have &s;carce any conception of its magnitude;
          for a moving column of fle&s;h, four|teen feet high, is an object &s;o utterly
          different from tho&s;e we are con&s;tantly pre&s;ented with, that to be
          conceived it mu&s;t be actually &s;een. Such, I own, were the &s;ugge&s;tions
          that natu|rally aro&s;e to me when I fir&s;t &s;aw this animal, and yet for the
          &s;ight of which I had taken care to prepare my imagination. I found my ideas
          fall as &s;hort of its real &s;ize as they did of its real figure; neither the
          pictures I had &s;een, nor the de&s;criptions I had read, giving me adequate
          conceptions of either.</P>
<P>It would, therefore, be impo&s;&s;ible to give an idea of this
          animal's figure by a de&s;cription; which, even a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the art of
          the engraver, will but confu&s;edly repre&s;ent the original. In general it may
          be ob&s;erved, that the forehead is <PB N="254" REF="337"> very high and
          ri&s;ing, the ears very large and dependant, the eyes extremely &s;mall, the
          pro|bo&s;cis, or trunk, long, the body round and full, the back ri&s;ing in an
          arch, and the whole ani|mal &s;hort in proportion to its height. The feet are
          round at the bottom; on each foot there are five flat horny ri&s;ings, which
          &s;eem to be the ex|tremities of the toes, but do not appear out|wardly. The
          hide is without hair, full of &s;cratches and &s;cars, which it receives in its
          pa&s;|&s;age through thick woods and thorny places. At the end of the tail
          there is a tuft of hair, a foot and a half long. The female is le&s;s than the
          male, and the udder is between the fore|legs. But a more accurate, as well as a
          more entertaining de&s;cription of the parts, will natu|rally occur in the
          hi&s;tory of their u&s;es.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupedes, the elephant is the &s;tronge&s;t, as well as
          the large&s;t; and yet, in a &s;tate of nature, it is neither fierce nor
          for|midable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have extracted the greate&s;t part of
            this de&s;cription from Mr. Buffon. Where I add, I mark with commas,
            "thus."</NOTE>. Mild, peaceful, and brave, it never abu&s;es its power or its
          &s;trength, and only u&s;es its force for its own protection, or that of its
          community. In its native de&s;arts, the elephant is &s;eldom &s;een alone, but
          appears to be a &s;ocial <PB N="255" REF="338"> friendly creature. The olde&s;t
          of the company conducts the band; that which is next in &s;e|niority brings up
          the rear. The young, the weak, and the &s;ickly, fall into the center; while
          the females carry their young, and keep them from falling by means of their
          trunks. They maintain this order only in dangerous marches, or when they
          de&s;ire to feed in cultivated grounds; they move with le&s;s precaution in the
          fore&s;ts and &s;olitudes; but without ever &s;eparat|ing, or removing &s;o far
          a&s;under as to be in|capable of lending each other any requi&s;ite
          a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Nothing can be more formidable than a drove of elephants as
          they appear at a di&s;tance in an African land&s;cape; wherever they march, the
          fore&s;t &s;eems to fail before them; in their pa&s;&s;age, they bear down the
          branches upon which they feed; and, if they enter into an inclo&s;ure, they
          de&s;troy all the labours of the hu&s;bandman in a very &s;hort time. Their
          in|va&s;ions are the more di&s;agreeable as there is no means of repelling
          them; &s;ince it would require a &s;mall army to attack the whole drove when
          united. It now and then happens that one or two is found lingering behind the
          re&s;t, and it is again&s;t the&s;e that the art and force of the hunters are
          united; but an attempt to mole&s;t the whole body would certainly be fatal.
          They <PB N="256" REF="339"> go forward directly again&s;t him who offers the
          in&s;ult, &s;trike him with their tu&s;ks, &s;eize him with their trunks, fling
          him into the air, and then trample him to pieces under their feet. But they are
          thus dreadful only when offended, and do no manner of per&s;onal injury when
          &s;uf|fered to feed without interruption. It is even &s;aid that they are
          mindful of injuries received; and, when once mole&s;ted by man, &s;eek all
          oc|ca&s;ions for the future to be revenged; they &s;mell him with their long
          trunks at a di&s;tance; follow him with all their &s;peed upon the &s;cent;
          and, though &s;low to appearance, they are &s;oon able to come up with and
          de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>In their natural &s;tate, they delight to live along the &s;ides of
          rivers, to keep in the deepe&s;t vales, to refre&s;h them&s;elves in the mo&s;t
          &s;hady fore&s;ts and watery places. They cannot live far from the water; and
          they always di&s;turb it before they drink. They often fill their trunk with
          it, either to cool that organ, or to divert them&s;elves by &s;purting it out
          like a fountain. They are equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the extremes of heat and
          cold; and, to avoid the former, they frequently take &s;helter in the mo&s;t
          ob&s;cure re|ce&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, or often plunge into the water, and
          even &s;wim from the continent into i&s;lands &s;ome leagues di&s;tant from the
          &s;hore.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="342">Their chief food is of the vegetable kind, for
          they loath all kind of animal diet. When one among their number happens to
          light upon a &s;pot of good pa&s;ture, he calls the re&s;t, and in|vites them
          to &s;hare in the entertainment; but it mu&s;t be a very copious pa&s;ture
          indeed that can &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the whole band. As with their
          broad and heavy feet they &s;ink deep wherever they go, they de&s;troy much
          more than they devour; &s;o that they are fre|quently obliged to change their
          quarters, and to migrate from one country to another. The Indians and Negroes,
          who are often incom|moded by &s;uch vi&s;itants, do all they can to keep them
          away, making loud noi&s;es, and large fires round their cultivated grounds; but
          the&s;e precautions do not always &s;ucceed; the ele|phants often break through
          their fences, de&s;troy their whole harve&s;t, and overturn their little
          habitations. When they have &s;atisfied them|&s;elves, and trod down or
          devoured whatever lay in their way, they then retreat into the woods in the
          &s;ame orderly manner in which they made their irruption.</P>
<P>Such are the habits of this animal con&s;idered in a &s;ocial light;

          po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the &s;en&s;es in great perfection, and is capable of
          applying them to more u&s;eful purpo&s;es than any other quadrupede. The
          elephant, as we ob&s;erved, has very &s;mall eyes, when compared to the
          enormous bulk of its body. But, though their minutene&s;s may at fir&s;t
          &s;ight appear deformed, yet, when we come to examine them, they are &s;een to
          exhibit a va|riety of expre&s;&s;ion, and to di&s;cover the various
          &s;en&s;ations with which it is moved. It turns them with attention and
          friend&s;hip to its ma&s;ter; it &s;eems to reflect and deliberate; and as its
          pa&s;|&s;ions &s;lowly &s;ucced each other, their various workings are
          di&s;tinctly &s;een.</P>
<P>The elephant is not le&s;s remarkable for the excellence of its
          hearing. Its ears are extremely large, and greater in proportion than even
          tho&s;e of an a&s;s. They are u&s;ually dependent; but it can readily rai&s;e
          and move them. They &s;erve al&s;o to wipe its eyes, and to protect them
          again&s;t the du&s;t and flies that might otherwi&s;e incom|mode them. It
          appears delighted with mu&s;ic, and very readily learns to beat time, to move
          in mea&s;ure, and even to join its voice to the &s;ound of the drum and the
          trumpet.</P>
<P>This animal's &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is not only exqui&s;ite, but
          it is in a great mea&s;ure plea&s;ed with the &s;ame odours that delight
          mankind. <PB N="259" REF="346"> The elephant gathers flowers with great
          plea|&s;ure and attention; it picks them up one by one, unites them into a
          no&s;egay, and &s;eems charmed with the perfume. The orange flower &s;eems to
          be particularly grateful both to its &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te and &s;melling; it
          &s;trips the tree of all its verdure, and eats every part of it, even to the
          branches them&s;elves. It &s;eeks in the meadows the mo&s;t odoriferous plants
          to feed upon; and in the woods it prefers the coco, the banana, the palm, and
          the &s;ago tree, to all others. As the &s;hoots of the&s;e are tender and
          filled with pith; it eats not only the leaves and the fruits, but even the
          branches, the trunk, and the whole plant to the very roots.</P>
<P>But it is in the &s;en&s;e of touching that this animal excels all
          others of the brute creation, and perhaps even man him&s;elf. The organ of this
          &s;en&s;e lies wholly in the trunk, which is an in&s;trument peculiar to this
          animal, and that &s;erves it for all the purpo&s;es of an hand. The trunk is,
          properly &s;peaking, only the &s;nout lengthened out to a great extent, hollow
          like a pipe, and ending in two openings, or no&s;trils, like tho&s;e of an hog.
          An elephant of fourteen feet high has the trunk about eight feet long and five
          feet and an half in circumference at the mouth, where it is thicke&s;t. It is
          hollow <PB N="260" REF="347"> all along, but with a partition running from one
          end of it to the other; &s;o that though out|wardly it appears like a &s;ingle
          pipe, it is in|wardly divided into two. This fle&s;hy tube is compo&s;ed of
          nerves and mu&s;cles, covered with a proper &s;kin of a blacki&s;h colour, like
          that of the re&s;t of the body. It is capable of being moved in every
          direction, of being lengthened and &s;hortened, of being bent or
          &s;treightened, &s;o pliant as to embrace any body it is applied to, and yet
          &s;o &s;trong that nothing can be torn from the gripe. To aid the force of this
          gra&s;p, there are &s;everal little eminences, like a cater|pillar's feet, on
          the under&s;ide of this in&s;trument, which without doubt contribute to the
          &s;en|&s;ibility of the touch as well as to the firmne&s;s of the hold. Through
          this trunk the animal breathes, drinks, and &s;mells, as through a tube; and at
          the very point of it, ju&s;t above the no&s;trils, there is an exten&s;ion of
          the &s;kin, about five inches long, in the form of a finger, and which in fact
          an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of one; for, with the re&s;t of the extremity of
          the trunk, it is capable of a&s;&s;uming different forms at will, and
          con&s;equently of being adapted to the mi|nute&s;t objects. By means of this,
          the elephant can take a pin from the ground, untie the knots of a rope, unlock
          a door, and even write with <PB N="261" REF="348"> a pen. 
          <Q REND="inline">"I have my&s;elf &s;een," &s;ays Aelian, "an
            elephant writing Latin characters on a board, in a very orderly manner, his
            keeper only &s;hew|ing him the figure of each letter. While thus employed, the
            eyes might be ob&s;erved &s;tudiou&s;ly ca&s;t down upon the writing, and
            exhibiting an appearance of great &s;kill and erudition."</Q> It &s;ometimes
          happens that the object is too large for the trunk to gra&s;p; in &s;uch a
          ca&s;e the ele|phant makes u&s;e of another expedient as ad|mirable as any of
          the former. It applies the extremity of the trunk to the &s;urface of the
          object, and, &s;ucking up its breath, lifts and &s;u&s;tains &s;uch a weight as
          the air in that ca&s;e is capable of keeping &s;u&s;pended. In this manner this
          in&s;trument is u&s;eful in mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es of life; it is an organ of
          &s;melling, of touching, and of &s;uction; it not only provides for the
          animal's nece&s;&s;ities and comforts, but it al&s;o &s;erves for its ornament
          and defence.</P>
<P>But, though the elephant be thus admirably &s;upplied by its trunk,
          yet, with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of its conformation, it is unwieldy and
          help|le&s;s. The neck is &s;o &s;hort that it can &s;carce turn the head, and
          mu&s;t wheel round in order to di&s;cover an enemy from behind. The hun|ters
          that attack it upon that quarter, generally thus e&s;cape the effects of its
          indignation; and <PB N="262" REF="349"> find time to renew their a&s;&s;aults
          while the ele|phant is turning to face them The legs are, indeed, not &s;o
          inflexible as the neck, yet they are very &s;tiff and bend not without
          difficulty. Tho&s;e before &s;eem to be longer than the hinder; but, upon being
          mea&s;ured, are found to be &s;omething &s;horter. The joints, by which they
          bend, are nearly in the middle, like the knee of a man; and the great bulk
          which they are to &s;upport makes their flexure ungainly. While the elephant is
          young, it bends the legs to lie down or to ri&s;e; but when it grows old, or
          &s;ickly, this is not performed without human a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and it
          becomes, con&s;equently, &s;o incon|venient, that the animal chu&s;es to
          &s;leep &s;tand|ing. The feet, upon which the&s;e ma&s;&s;y co|lumns are
          &s;upported; form a ba&s;e &s;carce broader than the legs they &s;u&s;tain.
          They are divided into five toes, which are covered beneath the &s;kin, and none
          of which appear to the eye; a kind of protuberance like claws are only
          ob|&s;erved, which vary in number from three to five. The apparent claws vary;
          the internal toes are con&s;tantly the &s;ame. The &s;oal of the foot is
          furni&s;hed with a &s;kin as thick and hard as horn, and which completely
          covers the whole under part of the foot.</P>
<P>To the re&s;t of the elephant's incumbrances may 
          <PB N="263" REF="350"> be added its enormous tu&s;ks, which are
          un&s;er|viceable for chewing, and are only weapons of defence. The&s;e, as the
          animal grows old, become &s;o heavy, that it is &s;ometimes obliged to make
          holes in the walls of its &s;tall to re&s;t them in, and ea&s;e it&s;elf of the
          fatigue of their &s;upport. It is well known to what an amazing &s;ize the&s;e
          tu&s;ks grow; they are two in number, proceeding from the upper jaw, and are
          &s;ometimes found above &s;ix feet long. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed them to be
          rather the horns than the teeth of this animal; but, be&s;ides their greater
          &s;imilitude to bone than to horn, they have been indi&s;putably found to grow
          from the upper jaw, and not from the frontal bones, as &s;ome have thought
          proper to a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Daubenton's de&s;cription
            of the &s;keleton of this animal.</NOTE>. Some al&s;o have a&s;&s;erted, that
          the&s;e tu&s;ks are &s;hed in the &s;ame manner as the &s;tag &s;heds its
          horns; but it is very probable, from their &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence, and from
          their accidental defects, which often appears to be the effect of a &s;low
          decay, that they are as fixt as the teeth of other animals are generally found
          to be. Cer|tain it is that the elephant never &s;heds them in a dome&s;tic
          &s;tate, but keeps them till they be|come inconvenient and cumbrous to the
          la&s;t degree. An account of u&s;es to which the&s;e <PB N="264" REF="351">
          teeth are applied, and the manner of chu&s;ing the be&s;t ivory, belongs rather
          to an hi&s;tory of the arts than of nature.</P>
<P>This animal is equally &s;ingular in other parts of its
          conformation; the lips and the tongue in other creatures &s;erve to &s;uck up
          and direct their drink or their food; but in the elephant they are totally
          inconvenient for &s;uch purpo&s;es; and it not only gathers its food with its
          trunk, but &s;up|plies it&s;elf with water by the &s;ame means. When it eats
          hay, as I have &s;een it frequently, it takes up a &s;mall wi&s;p of it with
          the trunk, turns and &s;hapes it with that in&s;trument for &s;ome time, and
          then directs it into the mouth, where it is chewed by the great grinding teeth,
          that are large in proportion to the bulk of the animal. This pacquet, when
          chewed, is &s;wallowed, and never ruminated again as in cows or &s;heep, the
          &s;tomach and inte&s;tines of this creature more re|&s;embling tho&s;e of an
          hor&s;e. Its manner of drinking is equally extraordinary. For this purpo&s;e,
          the elephant dips the end of its trunk into the water, and &s;ucks up ju&s;t as
          much as fills that great fle&s;hy tube compleatly. It then lifts up its head
          with the trunk full, and turning the point into its mouth, as if it intended to
          &s;wallow trunk and all, it drives the point below the opening of the
          wind-pipe. The trunk being <PB N="265" REF="352"> in this po&s;ition and
          &s;till full of water, the ele|phant then blows &s;trongly into it at the other
          end, which forces the water it contains into the throat, down which it is heard
          to pour with a loud gurgling noi&s;e, which continues till the whole is blown
          down. From this manner of drinking, &s;ome have been led into an opinion that
          the young elephant &s;ucks with its trunk and not with its mouth; this,
          however, is a fact which no traveller has hitherto had an op|portunity of
          &s;eeing, and it mu&s;t be referred to &s;ome future accident to determine.</P>
<P>The hide of the elephant is as remarkable as any other part. It is
          not covered over with hair as in the generality of quadrupedes, but is nearly
          bare. Here and there indeed, a few bri&s;tles are &s;een growing in the &s;cars
          and wrinkles of the body, and very thinly &s;cattered over the re&s;t of the
          &s;kin; but in general the head is dry, rough, and wrinkled, and re&s;embling
          more the bark of an old tree than the &s;kin of an animal. This grows thicker
          every year; and, by a con&s;tant addition of &s;ub&s;tance, it at length
          contracts that di&s;order well known by the name of the ele|phantia&s;is, or
          Arabian lepro&s;y; a di&s;ea&s;e to which man, as well as the elephant, is
          often &s;ubject. In order to prevent this, the Indians rub the elephant with
          oil, and frequently bathe <PB N="266" REF="353"> it to pre&s;erve its pliancy.
          To the inconve|niences of this di&s;order is added another, ari&s;ing from the
          great &s;en&s;ibility of tho&s;e parts that are not callous. Upon the&s;e the
          flies &s;ettle in great abundance, and torment this animal uncea&s;|ingly; to
          remedy which, the elephant tries all its arts; u&s;es not only its tail and
          trunk in the natural manner to keep them off, but even takes the branch of a
          tree, or a bundle of hay, to &s;trike them off with. When this fails, it often
          gathers up the du&s;t with its trunk, and thus covers all the &s;en&s;ible
          places. In this man|ner it has been &s;een to du&s;t it&s;elf &s;everal times a
          day, and particularly upon leaving the bath.</P>
<P>Water is as nece&s;&s;ary to this animal as food it&s;elf. When in a
          &s;tate of nature, the elephant rarely quits the banks of the river, and often
          &s;tands in water up to the belly. In a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, the Indians
          take equal care to pro|vide a proper &s;upply; they wa&s;h it with great
          addre&s;s; they give it all the conveniences for lending a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
          it&s;elf; they &s;mooth the &s;kin with a pumice &s;tone, and then rub it over
          with oils, e&s;&s;ences, and odours.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at that an animal furni&s;hed with &s;o
          many various advantages, both of &s;trength, &s;agacity, and obedience,
          &s;hould be taken into the &s;ervice of man. We accord|ingly 
          <PB N="267" REF="354"> find that the elephant, from time immemo|rial, has been
          employed either for the purpo&s;es of labour, of war, or of o&s;tentation; to
          encrea&s;e the grandeur of ea&s;tern princes, or to extend their dominions. We
          have hitherto been de&s;cribing this animal in its natural &s;tate; we now come
          to con&s;ider it in a different view, as taken from the fore&s;t and reduced to
          human obedience. We are now to behold this brave harmle&s;s crea|ture as
          learning a le&s;&s;on from mankind, and in|&s;tructed by him in all the arts of
          war, ma&s;&s;acre, and deva&s;tation. We are now to behold this half
          rea&s;oning animal led into the field of battle, and wondering at tho&s;e
          tumults and that madne&s;s which he is compelled to encrea&s;e. The elephant is
          a native of Africa and A&s;ia, being found neither in Europe nor America. In
          Africa he &s;till retains his natural liberty. The &s;avage inhabitants of that
          part of the world, in&s;tead of attempting to &s;ubdue this powerful creature
          to their nece&s;&s;ities, are happy in being able to protect them&s;elves from
          his fary. For|merly, indeed, during the &s;plendour of the Carthaginian empire,
          elephants were u&s;ed in their wars; but this was only a tran&s;itory gleam of
          human power in that part of the globe; the natives of Africa have long &s;ince
          degenerated, and the elephant is only known among them <PB N="268" REF="355">
          from his deva&s;tations. However, there are no elephants in the northern parts
          of Africa at pre&s;ent, there being none found on this &s;ide of Mount Atlas.
          It is beyond the river Senegal that they are to be met with in great numbers,
          and &s;o down to the Cape of Good Hope, as well as in the heart of the country.
          In this exten&s;ive region they appear to be more numerous than in any other
          part of the world. They are there le&s;s fearful of man; le&s;s retired into
          the heart of the fore&s;ts, they &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of his im|potence
          and ignorance; and often come down to ravage his little labours. They treat him
          with the &s;ame haughty di&s;dain which they &s;hew to other animals, and
          con&s;ider him as a mi&s;|chievous little being, that fears to oppo&s;e them
          openly.</P>
<P>But, although the&s;e animals are mo&s;t plentiful in Africa, it is
          only in A&s;ia that the greate&s;t elephants are found, and rendered
          &s;ub&s;ervient to human command. In Africa, the large&s;t do not exceed ten
          feet high; in A&s;ia they are found from ten to fifteen. Their price
          en|crea&s;es in proportion to their &s;ize; and when they exceed a certain
          bulk, like jewels, their value then ri&s;es as the fancy is plea&s;ed to
          e&s;timate.</P>
<P>The large&s;t are entirely kept for the &s;ervice 
          <PB N="269" REF="256"> of princes; and are maintained with the utmo&s;t
          magnificence, and at the greate&s;t expence. The u&s;ual colour of the elephant
          is a du&s;ky black, but &s;ome are &s;aid to be white; and the price of one of
          the&s;e is ine&s;timable. Such a one is peculiarly appropriated for the
          monarch's own riding; he is kept in a palace, attended by the nobles, and
          almo&s;t adored by the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. Vincent
              Marie.</BIBL></NOTE>. Some have &s;aid that the&s;e white elephants are larger
          than the re&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. Tachard.</BIBL></NOTE>;
          others a&s;&s;ert, that they are le&s;s; and &s;till others entirely doubt
          their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>As the art of war is but very little improved in A&s;ia, there are
          few princes of the ea&s;t who do not procure and maintain as many elephants as
          they are able, and place great confidence on their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in an
          engagement. For this purpo&s;e, they are obliged to take them wild in their
          native fore&s;ts, and tame them; for the ele|phant never breeds in a &s;tate of
          &s;ervitude. It is one of the mo&s;t &s;triking peculiarities in this
          extraordinary creature, that his generative pow|ers totally fail when he comes
          under the dominion of man; as if he &s;eemed unwilling to propagate a race of
          &s;laves, to encrea&s;e the pride of his con|queror. There is, perhaps, no
          other quadrupede that will not breed in its own native climate, if 
          <PB N="270" REF="357"> indulged with a moderate &s;hare of freedom; and we
          know, that many of them will copulate in every climate. The elephant alone has
          never been &s;een to breed; and though he has been re|duced under the obedience
          of man for ages, the duration of pregnancy, in the female<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

          in which it was po&s;&s;ible for him to have his information. From authorities
          equally doubtful, we learn, that the little one is about as large as a wild
          boar, the in&s;tant it is brought forth; that its tu&s;ks do not yet appear;
          but that all the re&s;t of its teeth are apparent; that, at the age of &s;ix
          months, it is as large as an ox, and its tu&s;ks pretty well grown; and that it
          continues, in this manner, for near thirty years, advancing to maturity. All
          this is doubtful; but it is certain, that, in <PB N="271" REF="358"> order to
          recruit the numbers which are con|&s;umed in war, the princes of the ea&s;t are
          every year obliged to &s;end into the fore&s;ts, and to u&s;e various methods
          to procure a fre&s;h &s;upply. Of all the&s;e numerous bands, there is not one
          that has not been originally wild; nor one that has not been forced into a
          &s;tate of &s;ubjection. Men them&s;elves are often content to propagate a race
          of &s;laves, that pa&s;s down in this wretched &s;tate through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
          generations; but the elephant, under &s;ubjection, is unalterably bar|ren;
          perhaps from &s;ome phy&s;ical cau&s;es, which are as yet unknown.</P>
<P>The Indian princes having vainly endea|voured to multiply the breed
          of elephants, like that of other animals, have been, at la&s;t, con|tent to
          &s;eparate the males from the females, to prevent tho&s;e acce&s;&s;es of
          de&s;ire, which debilitated, without multiplying the &s;pecies. In order to
          take them wild in the woods, a &s;pot of ground is fixed upon, which is
          &s;urrounded with a &s;trong palli&s;ade. This is made of the thicke&s;t and
          the &s;tronge&s;t trees; and &s;trengthened by cro&s;s bars, which give
          firmne&s;s to the whole. The po&s;ts are fixed at &s;uch di&s;tances from each
          other, that a man can ea&s;ily pa&s;s between them; there being only one great
          pa&s;&s;age left open, through which an elephant can ea&s;ily come; and 
          <PB N="272" REF="359"> which is &s;o contrived as to &s;hut behind, as &s;oon
          as the bea&s;t is entered. To draw him into this enclo&s;ure, it is
          nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to find him out in the woods; and a female elephant is
          conducted along into the heart of the fore&s;t, where it is obliged by its
          keeper to cry out for the male. The male very readily an&s;wers the cry, and
          ha&s;tens to join her; which the keeper per|ceiving, obliges her to retreat,
          &s;till repeating the &s;ame cry, until &s;he leads the animal into the
          enclo&s;ure already de&s;cribed, which &s;huts the moment he is entered. Still,
          however, the female proceeds calling, and inviting, while the male proceeds
          forward in the enclo&s;ure, which grows narrower all the way, and until the
          poor animal finds him&s;elf completely &s;hut up, without the power of either
          advancing or retreating; the female, in the mean time, being let out by a
          private way, which &s;he has been previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to. The wild
          elephant, upon &s;eeing him&s;elf entrapped in this manner, in&s;tantly
          attempts to u&s;e violence; and, upon &s;eeing the hunters, all his former
          de&s;ires only turn to fury. In the mean time, the hunters, having fixed him
          with cords, attempt to &s;often his indignation, by throwing buckets of water
          upon him in great quantities, rubbing the body with leaves, and pouring oil
          down his ears. Soon <PB N="273" REF="360"> after, two tame elephants are
          brought, a male and a female, that care&s;s the indignant animal with their
          trunks; while they &s;till continue pouring water to refre&s;h it. At la&s;t, a
          tame elephant is brought forward, of that number which is employed in
          in&s;tructing the new comers, and an officer riding upon it, in order to &s;hew
          the late captive that it has nothing to fear. The hunters then open the
          enclo&s;ure; and, while this creature leads the captive along, two more are
          joined on either &s;ide of it, and the&s;e compel it to &s;ubmit. It is then
          tied by cords to a ma&s;&s;y pillar provided for that purpo&s;e, and &s;uffered
          to remain in that po&s;ition for about a day and a night, until its indignation
          be wholly &s;ub&s;ided. The next day it begins to be &s;omewhat
          &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; and, in a fortnight, is completely tamed like the re&s;t. The
          females are taken when accompanying the males; they often come into the&s;e
          enclo&s;ures, and they &s;hortly after &s;erve as decoys to the re&s;t. But
          this method of taking the elephant, differs, according to the abilities of the
          hunter; the Negroes of Africa, who hunt this animal merely for its fle&s;h, are
          content to take it in pit|falls; and often to pur&s;ue it in the defiles of a
          mountain, where it cannot ea&s;ily turn, and &s;o wound it from behind till it
          falls.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="361">The elephant, when once tamed, becomes the
          mo&s;t gentle and obedient of all animals. It &s;oon conceives an attachment
          for the per&s;on that attends it, care&s;&s;es him, obeys him, and &s;eems to
          anticipate his de&s;ires. In a &s;hort time it begins to comprehend &s;everal
          of the &s;igns made to it, and even the different &s;ounds of the voice; it
          perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hes the tone of command from that of anger or
          approbation, and it acts accordingly. It is &s;eldom deceived in its ma&s;ter's
          voice; it receives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence,
          eagerly, yet without precipitation. All its mo|tions are regulated; and its
          actions &s;eem to par|take of its magnitude; being grave, maje&s;tic, and
          &s;ecure. It is quickly taught to kneel down, to receive its rider; it
          care&s;&s;es tho&s;e it knows with its trunk; with this &s;alutes &s;uch as it
          is ordered to di&s;tingui&s;h, and with this, as with an hand, helps to take up
          a part of its load. It &s;uffers it&s;elf to be arrayed in harne&s;s; and
          &s;eems to take a plea&s;ure in the finery of its trappings. It draws either
          chariots, cannon, or &s;hipping, with &s;urprizing &s;trength and
          per&s;everance; and this with a &s;eeming &s;atisfaction, provided that it be
          not beaten without a cau&s;e, and that its ma&s;ter appears plea&s;ed with its
          exertions.</P>
<P>The elephant's conductor is u&s;ually mounted <PB N="275" REF="362">
          upon its neck, and makes u&s;e of a rod of iron to guide it, which is
          &s;ometimes pointed, and at others bent into a hook. With this the animal is
          &s;purred forward, when dull or di&s;|obedient; but, in general, a word is
          &s;ufficient to put the gentle creature into motion, e&s;pe|cially when it is
          acquainted with its conductor. This acquaintance is often perfectly
          nece&s;&s;ary; for the elephant frequently takes &s;uch an af|fection to its
          keeper, that it will obey no other: and it has been known to die for grief,
          when, in &s;ome &s;udden fit of madne&s;s, it has killed its conductor. We are
          told, that one of the&s;e, that was u&s;ed by the French forces in India for
          the drawing their cannon, was promi&s;ed, by the conductor, a reward, for
          having per|formed &s;ome painful &s;ervice; but being di&s;ap|pointed of its
          expectations, it &s;lew him in a fury. The conductor's wife, who was a
          &s;pec|tator of this &s;hocking &s;cene, could not re&s;train her madne&s;s and
          de&s;pair; but running with her two children in her arms, threw them at the
          elephant's feet, crying out, that &s;ince it had killed her hu&s;band, it might
          kill her and her children al&s;o. The elephant, &s;eeing the child|ren at its
          feet, in&s;tantly &s;topped, and mode|rating its fury, took up the elde&s;t
          with its trunk, and placing him upon its neck, adopted <PB N="276" REF="363">
          him for its conductor, and obeyed him ever after with great punctuality.</P>
<P>But it is not for drawing burthens alone, that the elephants are
          &s;erviceable in war; they are often brought into the ranks, and compelled to
          fight in the mo&s;t dangerous parts of the field of battle. There was a time,
          indeed, in India, when they were much more u&s;ed in war than at pre&s;ent. A
          century or two ago, a great part of the dependance of the general, was upon the
          number and the expertne&s;s of his elephants; but of late, &s;ince war has been
          contented to adopt fatal in&s;tead of formidable arts, the elephant is little
          u&s;ed, except for drawing cannon, or tran&s;porting provi&s;ions. The princes
          of the country are plea&s;ed to keep a few for orna|ment, or for the purpo&s;es
          of removing their &s;eraglios: but they are &s;eldom led into a field of
          battle, where they are unable to with&s;tand the di&s;charge of fire-arms, and
          have been often found to turn upon their employers. Still, however, they are
          u&s;ed in war, in the more re|mote parts of the ea&s;t; in Siam, in Cochin
          China, in Tonquin, and Pegu. In all the&s;e places, they not only &s;erve to
          &s;well the pomp of &s;tate, being adorned with all the barbarian &s;plendour
          that tho&s;e countries can be&s;tow, but they are actually led into the field
          of battle, <PB N="277" REF="364"> armed before with coats of mail, and loaded
          on the back each with a &s;quare tower, contain|ing from five combatants to
          &s;even. Upon its neck &s;its the conductor, who goads the animal into the
          thicke&s;t ranks, and encourages it to encrea&s;e the deva&s;tation: wherever
          it goes, nothing can with&s;tand its fury; it lev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s the ranks with its immen&s;e bulk, flings &s;uch as
          op|po&s;e it into the air, or cru&s;hes them to death under its feet. In the
          mean time, tho&s;e who are placed upon its back, combat as from an emi|nence,
          and fling down their weapons with double force, their weight being added to
          their ve|locity. Nothing, therefore, can be more dread|ful, or more
          irre&s;i&s;tible, than &s;uch a moving machine, to men unacquainted with the
          modern arts of war; the elephant, thus armed and con|ducted, raging in the
          mid&s;t of a field of battle, in&s;pires more terror than even tho&s;e machines
          that de&s;troy at a di&s;tance, and are often mo&s;t fatal, when mo&s;t
          un&s;een. But this method of combating, is rather formidable than effectual:
          poli&s;hed nations have ever been victorious over tho&s;e &s;emi-barbarous
          troops that have called in the elephant to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or attempted
          to gain a victory by merely a&s;toni&s;hing their op|po&s;ers. The Romans
          quickly learned the art of opening their ranks, to admit the elephant; 
          <PB N="278" REF="365"> and thus &s;eparating it from a&s;&s;i&s;tance, quickly
          compelled its conductors to calm the animal's fury, and to &s;ubmit. It
          &s;ometimes al&s;o hap|pened that the elephant became impatient of control;
          and, in&s;tead of obeying its conductor, turned upon tho&s;e forces it was
          employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t. In either ca&s;e, there was a great deal of
          preparation to very little effect; for a &s;ingle elephant is known to
          con&s;ume as much as forty men in a day.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, therefore, they are chiefly employed in carrying or
          drawing burthens, throughout the whole Penin&s;ula of India; and no animal can
          be more fitted by nature for this employment. The &s;trength of an elephant is
          equal to its bulk, for it can, with great ea&s;e, draw a load that &s;ix
          hor&s;es could not remove: it can readily carry upon its back three or four
          thou&s;and weight; upon its tu&s;ks alone it can &s;upport near a thou&s;and:
          its force may al&s;o be e&s;timated from the velocity of its motion, compared
          to the ma&s;s of its body. It can go, in its ordinary pace, as fa&s;t as an
          hor&s;e at an ea&s;y trot; and, when pu&s;hed, it can move as &s;wiftly as an
          hor&s;e at full gallop. It can travel with ea&s;e fifty or &s;ixty miles a day;
          and when hard pre&s;&s;ed, almo&s;t double that quantity. It may be heard
          trotting on at a great di&s;tance; it <PB N="279" REF="366"> is ea&s;y al&s;o
          to follow it by the track, which is deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the ground, and
          from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter.</P>
<P>In India they are al&s;o put to other very di&s;|agreeable offices;
          for in &s;ome courts of the more barbarous princes, they are u&s;ed as
          execu|tioners; and this horrid ta&s;k they perform with great dexterity: with
          their trunks they are &s;een to break every limb of the criminal at the word of
          command; they &s;ometimes trample him to death, and &s;ometimes impale him on
          their enor|mous tu&s;ks, as directed. In this the elephant is rather the
          &s;ervant of a cruel ma&s;ter, than a voluntary tyrant, &s;ince no other animal
          of the fore&s;t is &s;o naturally benevolent and gentle; equally mindful of
          benefits as &s;en&s;ible of neg|lect, he contracts a friend&s;hip for his
          keeper, and obeys him even beyond his capacity.</P>
<P>In India, where they were at one time em|ployed in launching
          &s;hips, a particular elephant was directed to force a very large ve&s;&s;el
          into the water: the work proved &s;uperior to its &s;trength, but not to its
          endeavours; which, however, the keeper affected to de&s;pi&s;e. 
          <Q REND="inline">"Take away," &s;ays he, "that lazy bea&s;t, and
            bring another better fitted for &s;ervice."</Q> The poor animal in&s;tantly
          upon this redoubled its efforts, fractured its &s;cull, and died upon the
          &s;pot.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="367">In Deli, an elephant, pa&s;&s;ing along the
          &s;treets, put his trunk into a taylor's &s;hop, where &s;everal people were at
          work. One of the per|&s;ons of the &s;hop, de&s;irous of &s;ome amu&s;ement,
          pricked the animal's trunk with his needle, and &s;eemed highly delighted with
          this &s;light pu|ni&s;hment. The elephant, however, pa&s;&s;ed on without any
          immediate &s;igns of re&s;entment; but coming to a puddle filled with dirty
          water, he filled his trunk, returned to the &s;hop, and &s;purted the contents
          over all the finery upon which the taylors were then employed.</P>
<P>An elephant in Ad&s;meer, which often pa&s;&s;ed through the bazar
          or market, as he went by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a
          mouthful of greens. Being one day &s;eized with a periodical fit of madne&s;s,
          he broke his fetters, and, running through the market, put the crowd to flight;
          and, among others, this woman, who in her ha&s;te forgot a little child at her
          &s;tall. The elephant recollecting the &s;pot where his benefactre&s;s was
          accu&s;tomed to fit, took up the infant gently in his trunk, and conveyed it to
          a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope it is cu&s;tomary to hunt tho&s;e animals
          for the &s;ake of their teeth. Three hor&s;emen, well mounted, and armed with
          lances, attack the elephant alter|nately, <PB N="281" REF="368"> each relieving
          the other, as they &s;ee their companion pre&s;&s;ed, till the bea&s;t is
          &s;ub|dued. Three Dutchmen, brothers, who had made large fortunes by this
          bu&s;ine&s;s, deter|mined to retire to Europe, and enjoy the fruits of their
          labours; but they re&s;olved, one day be|fore they went, to have a la&s;t
          chace, by way of amu&s;ement: they met with their game, and began their attack
          in the u&s;ual manner; but, unfortunately, one of their hor&s;es falling,
          hap|pened to fling his rider; the enraged elephant in&s;tantly &s;eized the
          unhappy hunt&s;man with his trunk, flung him up to a va&s;t height in the air,
          and received him upon one of his tu&s;ks as he fell; and then turning towards
          the other two brothers, as if it were with an a&s;pect of revenge and in&s;ult,
          held out to them the impaled wretch, writhing in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>The teeth of the elephant are what produces the great enmity between
          him and mankind; but whether they are &s;hed, like the horns of the deer, or
          whether the animal be killed to obtain them, is not yet perfectly known. All we
          have as yet certain is, that the natives of Africa, from whence almo&s;t all
          our ivory comes, a&s;&s;ure us, that they find the greate&s;t part of it in
          their fore&s;ts; nor would, &s;ay they, the teeth of an elephant recompence
          them for their trouble <PB N="282" REF="369"> and danger in killing it:
          notwith&s;tanding, the elephants which are tamed by man, are never known to
          &s;hed their tu&s;ks; and from the hard|ne&s;s of their &s;ub&s;tance, they
          &s;eem no way ana|logous to deers horns.</P>
<P>The teeth of the elephant are very often found in a fo&s;&s;ile
          &s;tate. Some years ago, two great grinding-teeth, and part of the tu&s;k of an
          elephant, were di&s;coved, at the depth of forty-two yards, in a lead mine in
          Flint&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pennant's Synop&s;is, p.
              90.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tu&s;ks of the Mammouth, &s;o often found fo&s;&s;ile in
          Siberia, and which are converted to the purpo&s;es of ivory, are generally
          &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the elephant: however, the animal mu&s;t have been
          much larger in that country than it is found at pre&s;ent, as tho&s;e tu&s;ks
          are often known to weigh four hundred pounds; while tho&s;e that come from
          Africa, &s;eldom ex|ceed two hundred and fifty. The&s;e enormous tu&s;ks are
          found lodged in the &s;andy banks of the Siberian rivers; and the natives
          pretend that they belong to an animal which is four times as large as the
          elephant.</P>
<P>There have lately been di&s;covered &s;everal enormous &s;keletons,
          five or &s;ix feet beneath the &s;urface, on the banks of the Ohio, not remote
          from the river Miume in America, &s;even <PB N="283" REF="370"> hundred miles
          from the &s;ea-coa&s;t. Some of the tu&s;ks are near &s;even feet long; one
          foot nine inches in circumference at the ba&s;e, and one foot near the point;
          the cavity at the root or ba&s;e, nineteen inches deep. Be&s;ides their &s;ize,
          there are yet other differences: the tu&s;ks of the true elephant have
          &s;ometimes a very &s;light la|teral bend; the&s;e have a larger twi&s;t, or
          &s;piral curve, towards the &s;maller end: but the great and &s;pecific
          difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;hape of the grinding-teeth; which, in the&s;e
          newly found, are fa&s;hioned like the teeth of a carnivorous animal; not flat
          and ribbed tran&s;ver&s;ely on their &s;urface, like tho&s;e of the modern
          elephant, but furni&s;hed with a double row of high and conic proce&s;&s;es, as
          if intended to ma&s;ticate, not to grind their food. A third difference is in
          the thigh bone, which is of a great di&s;proportionable thickne&s;s to that of
          the elephant; and has al&s;o &s;ome other anatomical variations. The&s;e
          fo&s;&s;ile bones have been al&s;o found in Peru and the Brazils; and, when cut
          and poli&s;hed by the workers in ivory, appear, in every re&s;pect, &s;imilar.
          It is the opinion of Doctor Hunter that they mu&s;t have belonged to a larger
          animal than the elephant; and differing from it, in being carnivorous. But as
          yet this formidable <PB N="284" REF="371"> creature has evaded our &s;earch;
          and if, indeed, &s;uch an animal exi&s;ts, it is happy for man that it keeps at
          a di&s;tance; &s;ince what ravage might not be expected from a creature, endued
          with more than the &s;trength of the elephant, and all the rapacity of the
          tiger!</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="373"> NEXT to the elephant, the Rhinoceros is the
          mo&s;t powerful of animals. It is u&s;ually found twelve feet long, from the
          tip of the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail; from &s;ix to &s;even feet
          high; and the circumference of its body is nearly equal to its length. It is,
          there|fore, equal to the elephant in bulk; and if it appears much &s;maller to
          the eye, the rea&s;on is, that its legs are much &s;horter. Words can convey
          but a very confu&s;ed idea of this ani|mal's &s;hape; and yet there are few
          &s;o remark|ably formed: its head is furni&s;hed with an horn, growing from the
          &s;nout, &s;ometimes three feet and an half long; and but for this, that part
          would have the appearance of the head of an hog; the upper lip, however, is
          much longer in proportion, ends in a point, is very pliable, &s;erves to
          collect its food, and deliver it into the mouth: the ears are large, erect, and
          pointed; the eyes are &s;mall and piercing; the &s;kin is naked, rough, knotty,
          and, lying upon the body in folds, after a very peculiar fa&s;hion: there are
          two folds very remarkable; one above <PB REF="374">

          &s;houlders, and another over the rump: the &s;kin, which is of a dirty brown
          colour, is &s;o thick as to turn the edge of a &s;cymitar, and to re&s;i&s;t a
          mu&s;quet-ball: the belly hangs low; the legs are &s;hort, &s;trong and thick,
          and the hoofs divided into three parts, each pointing forward.</P>
<P>Such is the general outline of an animal that appears chiefly
          formidable from the horn grow|ing from its &s;nout; and formed rather for war,
          than with a propen&s;ity to engage. This horn, is &s;ometimes found from three
          to three feet and an half long, growing from the &s;olid bone, and &s;o
          di&s;po&s;ed, as to be managed to the greate&s;t advantage. It is compo&s;ed of
          the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance; and pointed &s;o as to in|flict the mo&s;t
          fatal wounds. The elephant, the boar, or the buffalo, are obliged to &s;trike
          tran&s;|ver&s;ely with their weapons; but the rhinoceros employs all his force
          with every blow; &s;o that the tiger will more willingly attack any other
          animal of the fore&s;t, than one who&s;e &s;trength is &s;o ju&s;tly employed.
          Indeed, there is no force which this terrible animal has to apprehend:
          defended, on every &s;ide, by a thick horny hide, which the claws of the lion
          or the tiger are unable to pierce, and armed before with a weapon that even the
          elephant does not chu&s;e <PB N="287" REF="377"> to oppo&s;e. The
          mi&s;&s;ioners a&s;&s;ure us, that the elephant is often found dead in the
          fore&s;ts, pierced with the horn of a rhinoceros; and though it looks like
          wi&s;dom to doubt whatever they tell us, yet I cannot help giving credit to
          what they relate on this occa&s;ion, particularly when confirmed by Pliny. The
          combat between the&s;e two, the mo&s;t formidable animals of the fore&s;t,
          mu&s;t be very dreadful. Emanuel, king of Portugal, willing to try their
          &s;trength, actually oppo&s;ed them to each other; and the elephant was
          defeated.</P>
<P>But though the rhinoceros is thus formi|dable by nature, yet
          imagination has not failed to exert it&s;elf, in adding to its terrors. The
          &s;cent is &s;aid to be mo&s;t exqui&s;ite; and it is affirmed, that it
          con&s;orts with the tiger. It is reported al&s;o, that when it has overturned a
          man, or any other animal, it continues to lick the fle&s;h quite from the bone
          with its tongue, which is &s;aid to be extremely rough. All this, however, is
          fabulous: the &s;cent, if we may judge from the expan&s;ion of the olfactory
          nerves, is not greater than that of an hog, which we know to be indifferent; it
          keeps company with the tiger, only becau&s;e they both frequent watery places
          in the burning climates where they are bred; and as to its rough 
          <PB N="288" REF="378"> tongue, that is &s;o far from the truth, that no animal
          of near its &s;ize has &s;o &s;oft a one. 
          <Q REND="inline">"I have often felt it my&s;elf," &s;ays Ladvocat, in
            his de&s;cription of this animal; "it is &s;mooth, &s;oft, and &s;mall, like
            that of a dog; and to the feel it appears as if one pa&s;&s;ed the hand over
            velvet. I have often &s;een it lick a young man's face who kept it; and both
            &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the action."</Q></P>
<P>The rhinoceros which was &s;hewn at London in 1739, and de&s;cribed
          by Doctor Par&s;ons, had been &s;ent from Bengal. Though it was very young, not
          being above two years old, yet the charge of his carriage and food from India,
          co&s;t near a thou&s;and pounds. It was fed with rice, &s;ugar, and hay: it was
          daily &s;upplied with &s;even pounds of rice, mixed with three of &s;ugar,
          di|vided into three, portions; it was given great quantities of hay and
          gra&s;s, which it chiefly preferred; its drink was water, which it took in
          great quantities. It was of a gentle di&s;|po&s;ition, and permitted it&s;elf
          to be touched and handled by all vi&s;itors, never attempting mi&s;chief,
          except when abu&s;ed, or when hungry; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, there was no method
          of ap|pea&s;ing its fury, but by giving it &s;omething to eat. When angry, it
          would jump up again&s;t the walls of its room, with great violence; and, 
          <PB N="289" REF="379"> many efforts to e&s;cape, but &s;eldom attempted to
          attack its keeper, and was always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his threats. It had a
          peculiar cry, &s;omewhat a mixture between the grunting of a hog, and the
          bellowing of a calf.</P>
<P>The age of the&s;e animals is not well known; it is &s;aid by
          &s;ome, that they bring forth at three years old, and if we may rea&s;on from
          analogy, it is probable they &s;eldom live till above twenty. That which was
          &s;hewn in London, was &s;aid by its keeper, to be eighteen years old, and even
          at that age, he pretended to con&s;ider it as a young one; however, it died
          &s;hortly after, and that probably in the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros is a native of the de&s;arts of A&s;ia and Africa,
          and is u&s;ually found in tho&s;e exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, that are frequented by
          the elephant and the lion. As it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entirely up|on vegetable food,
          it is peaceful and harmle&s;s among its fellows of the brute creation; but,
          though it never provokes to combat, it equally di&s;dains to fly. It is every
          way fitted for war, but re&s;ts content in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its
          &s;ecurity. It is particularly fond of the prickly branches of trees, and is
          &s;een to feed upon &s;uch thorny &s;hrubs as would be dangerous to other
          animals, either to gather, or to &s;wallow. The prickly points of the&s;e,
          however, may only <PB N="290" REF="380"> &s;erve to give a poignant reli&s;h to
          this animal's palate, and may an&s;wer the &s;ame grateful ends in
          &s;ea&s;oning its banquet, that &s;pices do in heightening ours.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the kingdom of A&s;ia, where the natives are more
          de&s;irous of appearing war|like than &s;hewing them&s;elves brave, the&s;e
          ani|mals are tamed, and led into the field to &s;trike terror into the enemy;
          but they are always an unmanageable and re&s;tive animal, and probably more
          dangerous to the employers, than tho&s;e whom they are brought to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The method of taking them, is chiefly watching them, till they are
          found either in &s;ome moi&s;t or mar&s;hy place, where, like hogs, they are
          fond of &s;leeping and wallowing. They then de&s;troy the old one with
          fire-arms, for no weapons, that are thrown by the force of man, are capable of
          entering this animal's hide. If, when the old one is de&s;troyed, there happens
          to be a cub, they &s;eize and tame it: the&s;e animals are &s;ometimes taken in
          pit-falls, cover|ed with green branches, laid in tho&s;e paths which the
          Rhinoceros makes in going from the fore&s;t to the river &s;ide.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome varieties in this animal, as in mo&s;t others;
          &s;ome of them are found in Africa with a double horn, one growing above 
          <PB N="291" REF="381"> the other; this weapon, if con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is
          one of the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t dangerous, that nature furni&s;hes to any
          part of the animal creation. The horn is entirely &s;olid, formed of the
          harde&s;t bony &s;ub&s;tance, growing from the upper maxilary bone, by &s;o
          &s;trong an apo|phy&s;e, as &s;eemingly to make but one part with it. Many are
          the medicinal virtues that are a&s;cribed to this horn, when taken in powder,
          but the&s;e qualities have been attributed to it, without any real foundation,
          and make only a &s;mall part of the many fables which this ex|traordinary
          animal has given ri&s;e to.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Hippopotamos.</HEAD>
<P>THE hippopotamos is an animal as large, and not le&s;s formidable
          than the Rhinoceros; its legs are &s;horter, and its head rather more bulky
          than that of the animal la&s;t de&s;cribed. We have had but few opportunities
          in Europe of examining this formidable creature mi|nutely, its dimen&s;ions,
          however, have been pretty well a&s;certained, by a de&s;cription given us by
          Zerenghi, an Italian &s;urgeon, who procured one of them to be killed on the
          banks of the river Nile. By his account it appears, that this terrible animal,
          which chiefly re&s;ides in the waters of that river, is above &s;eventeen feet
          long, from the extre|mity of the &s;nout, to the in&s;ertion of the tail; above
          &s;ixteen feet in circumference round the body, and above &s;even feet high:
          the head is near four feet long, and above nine feet in cir|cumference. The
          jaws open about two feet wide, and the cutting teeth, of which it hath four in
          each jaw, are above a foot long.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="383">Its feet, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;emble
          tho&s;e of the elephant, and are divided into four parts. The tail is &s;hort,
          flat, and pointed; the hide is amazingly thick, and though not capable of
          turning a mu&s;ket ball, is impenetrable to the blow of a &s;abre; the body is
          covered over with a &s;ew &s;cattered hairs, of a whiti&s;h colour. The whole
          figure of the animal is &s;omething between that of an ox and a hog, and its
          cry is &s;omething between the bellowing of the one, and the grunting of the
          other.</P>
<P>This animal, however, though &s;o terribly furni&s;hed for war,
          &s;eems no way di&s;po&s;ed to make u&s;e of it's prodigious &s;trength
          again&s;t an equal enemy; itchiefly re&s;ides at the bottom of the great rivers
          and lakes of Africa; the Nile, the Niger, and the Zara; there it leads an
          in|dolent kind of life, and &s;eems &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed for action, except
          when excited by the calls of hunger. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, three or four of
          them are often &s;een at the bottom of a river, near &s;ome cataract, forming a
          kind of line, and &s;eizing upon &s;uch fi&s;h as are forced down by the
          violence of the &s;tream. In that element they pur&s;ue their prey with great
          &s;wiftne&s;s and per&s;everance; they &s;wim with much force, and remain at
          the bottom for thirty or forty minutes without ri&s;ing to take breath. They
          traver&s;e the <PB N="294" REF="384"> the bottom of the &s;tream, as if walking
          upon land, and make a terrible deva&s;tation where they find plenty of prey.
          But it often happens, that this animal's fi&s;hy food is not &s;upplied in
          &s;uffi|cient abundance, it is then forced to come up|on land, where it is an
          awkward and unweildy &s;tranger; it moves but &s;lowly, and, as it &s;eldom
          for&s;akes the margin of the river, it &s;inks at every &s;tep it takes;
          &s;ometimes, however, it is forced, by famine, up into the higher grounds,
          where it commits dreadful havock among the plantations of the helple&s;s
          natives, who &s;ee their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions de&s;troyed, without daring to
          re&s;i&s;t their invader. Their chief method is, by lighting fires, &s;triking
          drums, and rai&s;ing a cry to frighten it back to its favourite element; and,
          as it is extremely timorous upon land, they generally &s;ucceed in their
          endeavours. But if they happen to wound, or otherways irritate it too
          clo&s;ely, it then becomes formid|able to all that oppo&s;e it: it overturns
          what|ever it meets, and brings forth all its &s;trength, which it &s;eemed not
          to have di&s;covered before that dangerous occa&s;ion. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the
          &s;ame inoffen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition in its favourite element, that it is found
          to have upon land; it is never found to attack the mariners in their boats, as
          they go up or down the &s;tream; but &s;hould <PB N="295" REF="385"> they
          inadvertently &s;trike again&s;t it, or otherwi&s;e di&s;turb its repo&s;e,
          there is much danger of its &s;ending them, at once, to the bottom. 
          <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een, &s;ays a mariner, as we find it in
            Dampier, one of the&s;e animals open its jaws, and &s;eizing any boat between
            his teeth, at once, bite and &s;ink it to the bottom. I have &s;een it upon
            another occa&s;ion, place it&s;elf under one of our boats, and ri&s;ing under
            it, over&s;et it with &s;ix men which were in it; who, however, happily
            received no other injury."</Q> Such is the great &s;trength of this animal; and
          from hence, pro|bably, the imagination has been willing to match it in combat
          again&s;t others more fierce and equally formidable. The crocodile and &s;hark
          have been &s;aid to engage with it, and yield an ea&s;y victory; but as the
          &s;hark is only found at &s;ea, and the hippopotomos never ventures beyond the
          mouth of fre&s;h-water rivers, it is mo&s;t probable that the&s;e engage|ments
          never occurred; it &s;ometimes happens, indeed, that the princes of Africa
          amu&s;e them|&s;elves with combats, on their fre&s;h-water lakes, between this
          and other formidable animals; but whether the rhinoceros or the crocodile are
          of this number, we have not been particularly informed. If this animal be
          attacked at land, and finding it&s;elf incapable of vengeance from 
          <PB N="296" REF="386"> the &s;wiftne&s;s of its enemy, it immediately returns
          to the river, where it plunges in head foremo&s;t, and after a &s;hort time
          ri&s;es to the &s;urface, loudly bellowing, either to invite or intimidate the
          enemy; but though the negroes will venture to attack the &s;hark, or the
          crocodile, in their natural element, and there de&s;troy them, they are too
          well appri&s;ed of the force of the hippo|potamos to engage it; this animal,
          therefore, continues the uncontrouled ma&s;ter of the river, and all others fly
          from its approach and become an ea&s;y prey.</P>
<P>As the hippopotomos lives upon fi&s;h and ve|getables, &s;o it is
          probable the fle&s;h of terre&s;trial animals may be equally grateful: the
          natives of Africa a&s;&s;ert, that it has often been found to devour children
          and other creatures that it was able to &s;urpri&s;e upon land; yet it moves
          but &s;lowly, almo&s;t every creature, endued with a common &s;hare of
          &s;wiftne&s;s, is able to e&s;cape it; and this animal, therefore, &s;eldom
          ventures from the river &s;ide, but when pre&s;&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ities of
          hunger, or of bringing forth its young.</P>
<P>The female always comes upon land to bring forth, and it is
          &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he &s;eldom pro|duces above one at a time; upon this
          occa&s;ion, the&s;e animals are particularly timorous, and 
          <PB N="297" REF="387"> dread the approach of a terre&s;trial enemy; the
          in&s;tant the parent hears the &s;lighte&s;t noi&s;e, it da&s;hes into the
          &s;tream, and the young one is &s;een to follow it with equal alacrity.</P>
<P>The young ones are &s;aid to be excellent eat|ing; but the negroes,
          to whom nothing that has life comes ami&s;s, find an equal delicacy in the old.
          Dr. Pocock has &s;een their fle&s;h &s;old in the &s;hambles, like beef; and it
          is &s;aid, that their brea&s;t, in particular, is as delicate eating as veal.
          As for the re&s;t, the&s;e animals are found in great numbers, and as they
          produce very fa&s;t, their fle&s;h, might &s;upply the countries where they are
          found, could tho&s;e barbarous regions produce more expert hunt&s;men; it may
          be remarked, however, that this creature, which was once in &s;uch plenty at
          the mouth of the Nile, is now wholly unknown in Lower Egypt, and is no where to
          be found in that river, except above the cataracts.</P>

<P>WERE we to be told of an animal &s;o tall, that a man on hor&s;eback

<P>No animal, either from its di&s;po&s;ition, or its formation,

          ho&s;tility; its horns are blunt, and even knobbed at the ends; its teeth are
          made entirely for vegetable pa&s;ture; its &s;kin is beautifully &s;peckled
          with white &s;pots, upon a browni&s;h ground; it is timorous and harmle&s;s,
          and not|with&s;tanding its great &s;ize, rather flies from, than re&s;i&s;ts
          the &s;lighte&s;t enemy; it partakes very much of the nature of the camel,
          which it &s;o nearly re&s;embles; it lives entirely upon vegeta|bles, and when
          grazing, is obliged to &s;pread its fore legs very wide, in order to reach its
          pa&s;ture; its motion is a kind of pace, two legs on each &s;ide moving at the
          &s;ame time, whereas in other animals they move tran&s;|ver&s;ely. It often
          lies down with its belly to the earth, and like the camel, has a callous
          &s;ub|&s;tance upon its brea&s;t, which, when repo&s;ed, defends it from
          injury. This animal was known to the ancients, but has been very rarely &s;een
          in Europe. One of them was &s;ent from the Ea&s;t to the Emperor of Germany, in

          and I am told, there are two there at pre&s;ent. When ancient Rome was in its
          &s;plendour, Pompey exhibited, at one time, no le&s;s than ten, upon the

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Camel, and the Dromedary.</HEAD>
<P>THESE names do not make two di&s;tinct kinds, but are only given to
          a variety of the &s;ame animal, which has, however, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted time
          immemorial. The principal, and perhaps the only &s;en&s;ible difference, by
          which tho&s;e two races are di&s;tingui&s;hed, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the
          camel has two bunches upon his back, whereas the dromedary has but one; the
          latter al&s;o, is neither &s;o large, nor &s;o &s;trong, as the camel. The&s;e
          two races, however, produce with each other, and the mixed breed formed between
          them is con&s;idered the be&s;t, the mo&s;t patient, and the mo&s;t
          indefatigable of all the kind.</P>
<P>Of the two varieties, the dromedary is, by far the mo&s;t numerous;
          the camel being &s;carcely found, except in Turkey, and the countries of the
          Levant, while the other is found &s;pread over all the De&s;arts of Arabia, the
          &s;outhern parts of Africa, Per&s;ia, Tartary, and a great part of the
          ea&s;tern Indies. Thus, the one in|habits an immen&s;e tract of country, the

          province; the one inhabits the &s;ultry countries of the Torrid Zone, the other
          delights in a warm, but not a burning climate; neither, however, can
          &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, or propagate, in the variable climates to|wards the north, they
          &s;eem formed for tho&s;e countries, where &s;hrubs are plenty and water
          &s;carce; where they can travel along the &s;andy de&s;art, without being
          impeded by rivers, and find food at expected di&s;tances; &s;uch a country is
          Arabia, and this of all others, &s;eems the mo&s;t adapted to the &s;upport and
          production of this animal.</P>
<P>The camel is the mo&s;t temperate of all ani|mals, and it can
          continue to travel &s;everal days without drinking. In tho&s;e va&s;t
          de&s;arts, where the earth is every where dry and &s;andy, where there are
          neither birds nor bea&s;ts, neither in&s;ects nor vegetables, where nothing is
          to be &s;een but hills of &s;and and heaps of bones, there the camel travels,
          po&s;ting forward, without requir|ing either drink or pa&s;ture, and is often
          found &s;ix or &s;even days without any &s;u&s;tenance what|&s;oever. Its feet
          are formed for travelling upon &s;and, and utterly unfit for moi&s;t or
          mar&s;hy places; the inhabitants, therefore, find a mo&s;t u&s;eful
          a&s;&s;i&s;tant in this animal, where no other could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and by its
          means, cro&s;s tho&s;e de|&s;arts <PB N="204" REF="401"> with &s;afety, which
          would be unpa&s;&s;able by any other method of conveyance.</P>
<P>An animal, thus formed for a &s;andy and de&s;art region, cannot be
          propagated in one of a different nature. Many vain efforts have been tried to
          propagate the camel, in Spain; they have been tran&s;ported into America, but
          have multiplied in neither. It is true, in|deed, that they may be brought into
          the&s;e countries, and may, perhaps, be found to pro|duce there, but the care
          of keeping them is &s;o great, and the accidents to which they are expo&s;ed,
          from the changeablene&s;s of the cli|mate, are &s;o many, that they cannot
          an&s;wer the care of keeping. In a few years al&s;o, they are &s;een to
          degenerate; their &s;trength and their patience for&s;ake them; and in&s;tead
          of making the riches, they become the burthen of their keepers.</P>
<P>But it is very different in Arabia, and tho&s;e countries where the
          camel is turned to u&s;eful purpo&s;es. It is there con&s;idered as a &s;acred
          animal, without who&s;e help, the natives could neither &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
          traffick, or travel; its milk makes a part of their nouri&s;hment; they feed
          upon its fle&s;h particularly when young; they clothe them&s;elves with its
          hair, which it is &s;een to molt regularly once a year, and if they fear an 
          <PB N="305" REF="402"> invading enemy, their camels &s;erve them in flight, and
          in a &s;ingle day, they are known to travel above an hundred miles. Thus, by
          means of the camel, an Arabian finds &s;afety in his de|&s;arts; all the armies
          upon earth might be lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit of a flying &s;quadron of this
          country, mounted upon their camels, and taking refuge in &s;olitudes where
          nothing interpo&s;es to &s;top their flight, or to force them to wait the
          in|vader. Nothing can be more dreary than the a&s;pect of the&s;e &s;andy
          plains, that &s;eem entirely for&s;aken of life and vegetation: wherever the
          eye turns, nothing is pre&s;ented but a &s;terril and du&s;ty &s;oil,
          &s;ometimes torn up by the winds, and moving in great waves along, which, when
          viewed from an eminence, re&s;emble le&s;s the earth than the ocean; here and
          there a few &s;hrubs appear that only teach us to wi&s;h for the grove that
          remind us of the &s;hade in the&s;e &s;ultry climates, without affording its
          re|fre&s;hment; the return of morning, which, in other places, carries an idea
          of chearfulne&s;s here &s;erves only to enlighten the endle&s;s and dreary
          wa&s;te, and to pre&s;ent the tra|veller with an unfini&s;hed pro&s;pect of his
          forlorn &s;ituation; yet in this cha&s;m of nature, by the help of the camel,
          the Arabian finds &s;afety and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance There are here and there 
          <PB N="306" REF="403"> found &s;pots of verdure, which, though remote from each
          other, are, in a manner, ap|proximated by the labour and indu&s;try of the
          camel. Thus the&s;e de&s;arts, which pre&s;ent the &s;tranger with nothing but
          objects of danger and &s;terility, afford the inhabitant protection, food, and
          liberty. The Arabian lives independant and tranquil in the mid&s;t of his
          &s;olitudes; and, in&s;tead of con&s;idering the va&s;t &s;olitudes &s;pread
          round him as a re&s;traint upon his happine&s;s, he is, by experience, taught
          to regard them as the ramparts of his freedom.</P>
<P>The camel is ea&s;ily in&s;tructed in the methods of taking up and
          &s;upporting his burthen; their legs, a few days after they are produced, are
          bent under their belly; they are in this manner loaded, and taught to ri&s;e;
          their burthen is every day thus encrea&s;ed, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, till
          the animal is capable of &s;upporting a weight adequate to its force: the
          &s;ame care is taken in making them patient of hunger and thir&s;t: while other
          animals receive their food at &s;tated times, the camel is re&s;trained for
          days together, and the&s;e intervals of famine are encrea&s;ed in proportion as
          the animal &s;eems capable of &s;u&s;tain|ing them. By this method of
          education, they live five or &s;ix days without food or water; and their
          &s;tomach is formed mo&s;t admirably by <PB N="307" REF="404"> nature, to fit
          them for long ab&s;tinence: be&s;ides the four &s;tomachs, which all animals
          have, that chew the cud, (and the camel is of the number) it has a fifth
          &s;tomach, which &s;erves as a re&s;ervoir, to hold a greater quantity of
          wa|ter than the animal has an immediate occa&s;ion for. It is of a &s;ufficient
          capacity to contain a large quantity of water, where the fluid remains without
          corrupting, or without being adulterat|ed by the other aliments: when the camel
          finds it&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed with thir&s;t, it has here an ea&s;y re&s;ource for
          quenching it; it throws up a quantity of this water by a &s;imple contraction
          of the mu&s;cles, into the other &s;tomachs, and this &s;erves to macerate its
          dry and &s;imple food; in this manner, as it drinks but &s;eldom, it takes in a
          large quantity at a time, and travellers, when &s;traightened for water, have
          been often known to kill their camels for that which they expected to find
          within them.</P>
<P>In Turky, Per&s;ia, Arabia, Barbary, and Egypt, their whole commerce
          is carried on by means of camels, and no carriage is more &s;peedy, and none
          le&s;s expen&s;ive in the&s;e coun|tries. Merchants and travellers unite
          them|&s;elves into a body, furni&s;hed with camels, to &s;ecure them&s;elves
          from the in&s;ults of the rob|bers that infe&s;t the countries in which they 
          <PB N="308" REF="405"> live. This a&s;&s;emblage is called a caravan, in which
          the numbers are &s;ometimes known to amount to above ten thou&s;and, and the
          num|ber of camels is often greater than tho&s;e of the men: each of the&s;e
          animals is loaded according to his &s;trength, and he is &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
          it him|&s;elf, that when his burthen is too great, he remains &s;till upon his
          belly, the po&s;ture in which he is loaden, refu&s;ing to ri&s;e, till his
          burthen be le&s;&s;ened or taken away. In general, the large camels are capable
          of carrying a thou&s;and weight, and &s;ometimes twelve hun|dred; the dromedary
          from &s;ix to &s;even. In the&s;e trading journies, they travel but &s;lowly,
          their &s;tages are generally regulated, and they &s;eldom go above thirty, or
          at mo&s;t about five and thirty miles a day. Every evening, when they arrive at
          a &s;tage, which is u&s;ually &s;ome &s;pot of verdure, where water and
          &s;hrubs are in plenty, they are permitted to feed at liberty; they are then
          &s;een to eat as much in an hour, as will &s;upply them for twenty-four, they
          &s;eem to prefer the coar&s;e&s;t weeds to the &s;ofte&s;t pa&s;ture, the
          thi&s;tle, the nettle, the ca&s;ia, and other prickly vegetables, are their
          favourite food; but their drivers take care to &s;upply them with a kind of
          pa&s;te compo&s;ition, which &s;erves as a more permanent nouri&s;hment. As
          the&s;e animals <PB N="309" REF="406"> have often gone the &s;ame track, they
          are &s;aid to know their way preci&s;ely, and to pur&s;ue their pa&s;&s;age
          when their guides are utterly a&s;tray: when they come within a few miles of
          their baiting-place, in the evening, they &s;agaciou&s;ly &s;cent it at a
          di&s;tance, and encrea&s;ing their &s;peed, are often &s;een to trot, with
          vivacity to their &s;tage.</P>
<P>The patience of this animal is mo&s;t extraor|dinary; and it is
          probable, that its &s;ufferings are great, for when it is loaded, it &s;ends
          forth mo&s;t lamentable cries, but never offers to re&s;i&s;t the tyrant that
          oppre&s;&s;es it. At the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ign, it bends its knees and lies upon
          its belly, &s;uffer|ing it&s;elf to be loaded in this po&s;ition; by this
          practice the burthen is more ea&s;ily laid upon it, than if lifted up while
          &s;tanding; at another &s;ign it ri&s;es with its load, and the driver getting
          upon its back, between the two panniers, which, like hampers, are placed upon
          each &s;ide, he encourages the camel to proceed with his voice and with a
          &s;ong. In this manner the creature proceeds contentedly forward, with a &s;low
          un|ea&s;y walk, of about four miles an hour, and when it comes to its &s;tage,
          lies down to be unloaded, as before.</P>
<P>Mr. Buffon &s;eems to con&s;ider the camel to be the mo&s;t
          dome&s;ticated of all other creatures, <PB N="310" REF="407"> and to have more
          marks of the tyranny of man imprinted on its form. He is of opinion, that this
          animal is not now to be found in a &s;tate of nature, that the humps on its
          back, the calo|&s;ities upon its brea&s;t, and its legs, and even the great
          re&s;ervoir for water, are all marks of long &s;ervitude and dome&s;tic
          con&s;traint. The deformities he &s;uppo&s;es to be perpetuated by generation,
          and what at fir&s;t was accident at la&s;t becomes nature. However this be, the
          humps upon the back grow large in proportion as the animal is well fed, and if
          examined, they will be found compo&s;ed of a &s;ub&s;tance not unlike the udder
          of a cow.</P>
<P>The inhabitants generally leave but one male to wait on ten females,
          the re&s;t they ca&s;trate; and though they thus become weaker, they are more
          manageable and patient. The female receives the male in the &s;ame po&s;i|tion
          as when the&s;e animals are loaded; &s;he goes with young for about a year,
          and, like all other great animals, produces but one at a time. The camel's milk
          is abundant and nouri&s;hing, and mixed with water makes a principle part of
          the beverage of the Arabians. The&s;e animals begin to engender at three years
          of age, and they ordinarily live from forty to fifty years. The genital part of
          the male re&s;embles that of <PB N="311" REF="408"> the bull, but is placed
          pointing backwards, &s;o that its urine &s;eems to be ejected in the manner of
          the female. This, as well as the dung, and al|mo&s;t every part of this animal,
          is converted to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e by the keepers. Of the urine
          falmoniac is made; and of the dung, lit|ter for the hor&s;es, and fire, for the
          purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing their victuals. Thus, this animal alone &s;eems to
          compri&s;e within it&s;elf, a variety of qualities, any one of which &s;erves
          to render other quadrupedes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of man;
          like the elephant, it is man|ageable and tame; like the hor&s;e, it gives the
          rider &s;ecurity; it carries greater burthens than the ox, or the mule, and its
          milk is furni&s;hed in as great abundance as that of the cow; the fle&s;h of
          the young ones is &s;uppo&s;ed to be as deli|cate as veal; their hair is more
          beautiful, and more in reque&s;t than wool; while even of its very excrements,
          no part is u&s;ele&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The Lama.</HEAD>
<P>AS almo&s;t all the quadrupedes of America are &s;maller than the
          re&s;embling ones of the ancient continent, &s;o the lama, which may be
          con&s;i|dered as the camel of the new world, is every way le&s;s than that of
          the old. This animal, like that de&s;cribed in the former chapter, &s;tands
          high upon its legs, has a long neck, a &s;mall head, and re&s;embles the camel,
          not only in its natural mildne&s;s, but its aptitude for &s;ervitude, its
          moderation, and its patience. The Ameri|cans early found out its u&s;eful
          qualities, and availed them&s;elves of its labours: like the camel, it &s;erves
          to carry goods over places in|acce&s;&s;ible to other bea&s;ts of burthen; like
          that it is obedient to its driver, and often dies under, but never re&s;i&s;ts
          his cruelty.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e animals, &s;ome are white, others black, but they are
          mo&s;tly brown; its face re|&s;embles that of the camel, and its height is
          about equal to that of an a&s;s. They are not found in the ancient continent,
          but en|tirely <PB N="313" REF="410"> belong to the new; nor are they found
          &s;pread over all America, but are found chiefly upon tho&s;e mountains, that
          &s;tretch from New Spain to the Streights of Magellan. They inhabit the
          highe&s;t regions of the globe, and &s;eem to require purer air than animals of
          a lower &s;ituation are found to enjoy. Peru &s;eems to be the place where they
          are found in greate&s;t plenty. In Mexico, they are introduced rather as
          curio&s;ities than bea&s;ts of burthen; but in Poto&s;i, and other provinces of
          Peru, they make the chief riches of the Indians and Spaniards who rear them:
          their fle&s;h is excellent food; their hair or rather wool, may be &s;pun into
          beautiful cloathing, and they are capable, in the mo&s;t rugged and dangerous
          ways, of carrying burthens not ex|ceeding a hundred weight, with the greate&s;t
          &s;afety. It is true indeed that they go but &s;lowly, and &s;eldom above
          fifteen miles a day; their tread is heavy, but &s;ure, they de&s;cend
          precipices, and find footing among the mo&s;t craggy rocks where even men can
          &s;carce ac|company them; they are, however, but feeble animals, and after four
          or five days labour, they are obliged to repo&s;e for a day or two. They are
          chiefly u&s;ed in carrying the riches of the mines of Poto&s;i, and we are told
          that there <PB N="314" REF="411"> are above three hundred thou&s;and of the&s;e
          animals in actual employ.</P>
<P>This animal, as was &s;aid before, is above three feet high, and the
          neck is three feet long, the head is &s;mall and well proportioned, the eyes
          large, the no&s;e long, the lips thick, the upper divided, and the lower a
          little depending, like all tho&s;e animals that feed upon gra&s;s, it wants the
          upper cutting teeth; the ears are four inches long, and move with great
          agility; the tail is but five inches long, it is &s;mall, &s;trait, and a
          little turned up at the end; it is cloven footed, like the ox, but it has a
          kind of &s;pear|like appendage behind, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in mov|ing over
          precipices and rugged ways; the wool on the back is &s;hort, but long on the
          &s;ides and the belly; it re&s;embles the camel in the for|mation of the
          genital parts in the male, &s;o that it makes urine backwards; it couples
          al&s;o in the &s;ame manner, and though it finds much difficulty in the action,
          it is &s;aid to be much inclined to venery. A whole day is often pa&s;&s;ed,
          before this nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s can be compleated, which is &s;pent in
          growling, quarrelling, and &s;pitting at each other; they &s;eldom produce
          above one at a time, and their age never extends above ten or twelve years at
          farthe&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="412">Though the lama is no way comparable to the

          appears formed for that indolent race of ma&s;ters, which it is obliged to
          &s;erve; it re|quires no care, nor no expence in the attending or providing for
          its &s;u&s;tenance; it is &s;upplied with a warm covering, and therefore does
          not require to be hou&s;ed; &s;atisfied with vegetables and gra&s;s, it wants
          neither corn nor hay to &s;ub&s;i&s;t it; it is not le&s;s moderate in what it
          drinks, and exceeds even the camel in tem|perance. Indeed, of all other
          creatures, it &s;eems to require water lea&s;t, as it is &s;upplied by nature
          with &s;aliva in &s;uch large quantities, that it &s;pits it out on every
          occa&s;ion: this &s;aliva &s;eems to be the only offen&s;ive weapon that the
          harmle&s;s creature has to te&s;tify its re&s;entment. When overloaded, or
          fatigued, and driven on by all the torturing acts of its keeper, it falls on
          its belly, and pours out again&s;t him, a quantity of this fluid; which, though
          probably no way hurtful, the Indians are much afraid of They &s;ay, that
          wherever it falls, it is of &s;uch an acrimonious nature, that it will either
          burn the &s;kin, or cau&s;e very dangerous erup|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="413">Such are the&s;e animals in their dome&s;tic

          &s;tranger, they regard him at fir&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment, without marking
          any fear or &s;urprize; but &s;hortly, as if by common con&s;ent, they &s;nuff

          the mountain, and &s;eem vigorous in proportion to the cold|ne&s;s of their

          obliged to de&s;i&s;t in their pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The lama &s;eems to be the large&s;t of the camel kind in America;
          there are others, which are <PB N="317" REF="414"> called guanacoes and pacos,

          each other, that the hor&s;e does to the a&s;s, and are employed with the
          &s;ame de|gree of &s;ubordination. The wool, however, of the paco, &s;eems to
          be the mo&s;t valuable, and it is formed into &s;tuffs, not inferiour to
          &s;ilk, either in price or beauty. The natural colour of the paco, is that of a
          dried ro&s;e leaf; the manufacturers &s;eldom give its wool any other dye, but
          form it into quilts and carpets, which exceed tho&s;e from the Levant. This
          manufacture forms a very con&s;iderable branch of commerce in South America,

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. The Nyl-ghau.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal, the name of which is pro|nounced nylgaw is a native of
          India, and has but lately been imported into Europe; it &s;eems to be of a
          middle nature, between the cow and the deer, and carries the appearance of both
          in its form. In &s;ize, it is as much &s;maller than the one, as it is larger
          than the other; its body, horns, and tail, are not unlike tho&s;e of a bull;
          and the head, neck, and legs, are very like tho&s;e of a deer. The colour, in
          ge|neral, is a&s;h or grey, from a mixture of black hairs and white; all along
          the ridge or edge of the neck, the hair is blacker, larger, and more erect,
          making a &s;hort thin and upright mane. Its horns are &s;even inches long, they
          are &s;ix inches round at the root, growing &s;maller by degrees, they
          terminate in a blunt point. The bluntne&s;s of the&s;e, together with the form
          of its head and neck, might incline us to &s;uppo&s;e it was of the deer kind;
          but, as it never &s;heds its horns, it has a greater affinity to the cow.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="416">From the di&s;po&s;ition of that brought over
          to this country, which has been very accurately and minutely de&s;cribed by Dr.
          Hunter, their manners were harmle&s;s and gentle. Although in its native
          wildne&s;s, it is &s;aid to be fierce and vicious, this &s;eemed plea&s;ed with
          every kind of familiarity, and always licked the hand that &s;troked, or gave
          it bread, and never once attempted to u&s;e its horns offen&s;ively; it
          &s;eemed to have much de|pendance on its organs of &s;mell, and &s;nuffed
          keenly, and with noi&s;e, whenever any per&s;on came within &s;ight; it did
          &s;o likewi&s;e, when any food or drink was brought to it; and was &s;o
          ea&s;ily offended with &s;mells, or &s;o cautious, that it would not ta&s;te
          the bread which was offered, when the hand happened to &s;mell &s;trong of
          turpentine. Its manner of fighting is very par|ticular. It was ob&s;erved, at
          Lord Clive's, where two males were put into a little inclo&s;ure, that, while
          they were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, they prepared for the
          attack, by falling upon their fore-knees, then they &s;huffled towards each
          other, with a quick pace, keeping &s;till upon their fore-knees; and when they
          were come within &s;ome yards, they made a &s;pring and darted again&s;t each
          other. The intrepidity and force with which they dart again&s;t any object,
          appeared by the &s;trength with which <PB N="320" REF="417"> one of them
          attempted to over-turn a poor labourer who unthinkingly &s;tood on the
          out&s;ide of the pales of its inclo&s;ure. The Nyl ghau, with the quickne&s;s
          of lightning, darted again&s;t the wood-work with &s;uch vio|lence, that he
          broke it to pieces, and broke off one of his horns clo&s;e to the root, which
          occa|&s;ioned the animal's death. At all the places in India where we have
          &s;ettlements, they are con&s;idered as rarities, and brought from the
          di&s;tant interiour parts of the country. The Emperor, &s;ometimes, kills them
          in &s;uch num|bers, as to di&s;tribute quarters of them to all his omrahs;
          which &s;hews that they are internally wild and in plenty, and e&s;teemed good
          or dili|cious food. The nyl-ghaus, which have been brought to England, have
          been mo&s;t, if not all of them, received from Surat or Bombay; and they &s;eem
          to be le&s;s uncommon in that part of India, than in Bengal; which gives room
          for a conjecture, that they may be indigenous, per|haps in the province of
          Guzarat, one of the mo&s;t we&s;tern and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the

<P><PB N="321" REF="419">OF the bear, there are three different kinds,
          the brown bear of the Alps, the black bear of North-America, which is
          &s;maller, and the great Greenland, or white bear. The&s;e, tho' diffe|rent in
          their form, are no doubt of the &s;ame original, and owe their chief variations
          to food and climate. They have all the &s;ame habitudes, being equally
          carnivorous, treacherous and cruel. It has been &s;aid indeed, that the black
          bear of America, rejects animal food, but of the contrary I am certain, as I
          have often &s;een the young ones, which are brought over to London, prefer
          fle&s;h to every kind of veget|able aliment.</P>
<P>The brown bear, is properly an inhabitant of the temperate climates;
          the black finds &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance in the northern regions of Europe and
          America, while the great white bear takes re|fuge in the mo&s;t icy climates,
          and lives where &s;carce any other animal can find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>

<P><PB N="322" REF="422">The brown bear 
          <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> is not only
          &s;avage but &s;o|litary; he takes refuge in the mo&s;t unfrequent|ed parts,
          and the mo&s;t dangerous precipices of uninhabited mountains. It chu&s;es its
          den in the mo&s;t gloomy parts of the fore&s;t, in &s;ome cavern that has been
          hollowed by time, or in the hollow of &s;ome old enormous tree. There it
          retires alone, and pa&s;&s;es &s;ome months of the winter without provi&s;ions,
          or without ever &s;tir|ring abroad. However this animal is not intirely
          deprived of &s;en&s;ation like the bat, or the dor|mou&s;e, but &s;eems rather
          to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the exuberance of its former fle&s;h, and only feels the
          calls of appetite, when the fat it had ac|quired in &s;ummer, begins to be
          entirely wa&s;ted away. In this manner, when the bear retires to its den, to
          hide for the winter, it is ex|tremely fat, but at the end of forty or fifty
          days, when it comes forth to &s;eek for fre&s;h nouri&s;hment, it &s;eems to
          have &s;lept all its fle&s;h away. It is a common report, that during this
          time, they live by &s;ucking their paws, which is a vulgar error that &s;carce
          requires confuta|tion. The&s;e &s;olitary animals couple in au|tumn, but the
          time of ge&s;tation with the fe|male is &s;till unknown; the female takes great
          care to provide a proper retreat for her young, <PB N="323" REF="423"> &s;he
          &s;ecures them in the hollow of a rock, and provides a bed of hay in the
          warme&s;t part of the den; &s;he brings forth in winter, and the young ones
          begin to follow her in &s;pring. The male and female, by no means inhabit the
          &s;ame den; they have each their &s;eparate retreat, and &s;eldom are &s;een
          together but upon the acce&s;&s;es of genial de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The voice of the bear is a kind of growl, interrupted with rage,
          which is often caprici|ou&s;ly exerted; and tho' this animal &s;eems gen|tle
          and placid to its ma&s;ter, when tamed; yet it is &s;till to be di&s;tru&s;ted
          and managed with caution, as it is often treacherous and re&s;entful without a
          cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This animal is capable of &s;ome degree of in|&s;truction. There are
          few but have &s;een it dance in aukward mea&s;ures upon its hind feet, to the
          voice or the in&s;trument of its leader; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that
          the dancer is of|ten found to be the be&s;t performer of the two. I am told,
          that it is fir&s;t taught to perform in this manner, by &s;etting it upon hot
          plates of iron, and then playing to it, while in this un|ea&s;y
          &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The bear, when come to maturity, can ne|ver be tamed; it then
          continues in its native fiercene&s;s, and tho' caged, &s;till formidably
          im|potent, <PB N="324" REF="424"> at the approach of its keeper flies to meet
          him. But notwith&s;tanding the fierce|ne&s;s of this animal, the natives in
          tho&s;e coun|tries where it is found, hunt it with great per&s;everance and
          alacrity. The lea&s;t danger|ous method of taking it is by intoxicating it, by
          throwing brandy upon honey, which it &s;eems to be chiefly fond of, and &s;eeks
          for in the hollow of trees. In Canada, where the black bears are very common,
          and where their dens are made in trees, that are hollow towards the top, they
          are taken by &s;etting fire to their retreats, which are often above thirty
          feet from the ground. The old one is generally &s;een fir&s;t to i&s;&s;ue from
          her den, and is &s;hot by the hunters. The young ones, as they de&s;cend, are
          caught in a noo&s;e, and are either kept or killed for provi&s;ion. Their paws
          are &s;aid to be a great delicacy, and their hams are well enough known at the
          tables of the luxurious here. Their fat al&s;o, which &s;till pre&s;erves a
          certain degree of fluidity, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an efficacious remedy in
          white or indolent tumours, tho' probably very little &s;uperior to hogs
          lard.</P>
<P>The white Greenland bear differs greatly, both in figure and
          dimen&s;ions, from tho&s;e al|ready de&s;cribed; and tho' it pre&s;erves in

<P>The white bear, &s;eems the only animal, that by being placed in the
          colde&s;t climate, grows larger than tho&s;e that live in the temperate zones.
          All other &s;pecies of animated nature, dimini&s;h as they approach the poles,
          and &s;eem contracted in their &s;ize, by the rigours of the ambient
          atmo&s;phere, but the bear, being un|mole&s;ted in the&s;e de&s;olate climates,
          and meet|ing no animal, but what he can ea&s;ily con|quer, finding al&s;o a
          &s;ufficient &s;upply of fi&s;hy provi&s;ions, he grows to an enormous &s;ize,
          and as the lion is the tyrant of an African fore&s;t, &s;o the bear remains
          undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the icy mountains in Spitzbergen and Green|land. When
          our mariners land upon tho&s;e <PB N="326" REF="429"> &s;hores, in &s;uch parts
          as have not been frequent|ed before, the white bears come down to view them
          with an aukward curio&s;ity; they ap|proach &s;lowly, &s;eeming undetermined
          whether to advance or retreat, and being naturally a timorous animal, they are
          only urged on by the con&s;cious experience of their former vic|tories;
          however, when they are &s;hot at, or wounded, they endeavour to fly, or finding
          that impracticable, they make a fierce and de&s;|perate re&s;i&s;tance till
          they die. As they live upon fi&s;h and &s;eals, their fle&s;h is too &s;trong
          for food, and the captors have nothing but the &s;kin, to reward them, for the
          dangers incur|red in the engagement.</P>
<P>The number of the&s;e animals that are found about the north-pole,
          if we con&s;ider the &s;car|city thereof, of all other terre&s;trial creatures
          is very amazing. They are not only &s;een at land, but often on ice-floats,
          &s;everal leagues at &s;ea. They are often tran&s;ported in this manner to the
          very &s;hores of Iceland, where they no &s;oon|er land, but all the natives are
          in arms to re|ceive them. It often happens, that when a greenlander and his
          wife are paddling out at &s;ea, by coming too near an ice-float, a white bear
          unexpectedly jumps into their boat, and if he does not over&s;et it, &s;its
          calmly where <PB N="327" REF="430"> he fir&s;t came down, and like a
          pa&s;&s;enger, &s;uf|fers him&s;elf to be rowed along. It is probable the poor
          little greenlander is not very fond of his new gue&s;ts, however he makes a
          virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and ho&s;pitably rows him to &s;hore.</P>
<P>As this animal lives chiefly upon fi&s;h, &s;eals, and dead whales,
          it &s;eldom removes far from the &s;hore. When forced by hunger, it often
          ventures into the deep, &s;wims after &s;eals, and devours whatever it can
          &s;eize; it is however but a bad &s;wimmer, and it is often hunted in this
          manner by boats, till it is fatigued, and at la&s;t de&s;troyed. It often
          happens a battle en|&s;ues between a bear and a mor&s;e or a whale, as the
          latter are more expert in their own element, they generally prove victorious.
          However, when the bear can find a young whale, it re|pays him for the danger he
          incurs of meeting with the parent.</P>

<P>THE badgers legs are &s;o &s;hort, that its belly &s;eems to touch

          the length of the hair, which is very long all over the body, and makes it
          &s;eem much more bulky that it really is. It is a &s;olitary &s;tupid animal,
          that finds refuge, remote from man, and digs it&s;elf a deep hole, with great
          a&s;&s;iduity. It &s;eems to avoid the light, and &s;eldom quits its retreat by
          day, only &s;tealing out at night to find &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. It burrows in the

          and horny. As it continues to bury it&s;elf, and throw the earth behind it, to
          a great di&s;|tance, and thus forms to it&s;elf a winding hole, at the bottom
          of which it remains in &s;afety. As the fox is not &s;o expert at digging into

<P>THERE are many animals that live upon ants in Africa and America;
          the pangolin or &s;caly lizard of Guinea may be con&s;idered among this number;
          but there are a greater variety in America, which makes tho&s;e minute
          in&s;ects their only &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Though they are of different figures
          and &s;izes, yet in general they go under one common name of the ant-bear; the
          peculiar length and &s;lenderne&s;s of their &s;nout, their &s;ingular
          appetites, and their man|ner of taking their prey, &s;triking us too
          &s;trong|ly to attend to the minute differences of their &s;ize or form.</P>
<P>They have been cla&s;&s;ed by Mr. Buffon into the larger tamandua,
          the &s;maller tamandua, and the ant-eater. The longe&s;t of this kind is four
          feet long, from the tip of the &s;nout to the in|&s;ertion of the tail; their

          long, the tail is without hair, and it &s;weeps the ground as the animal moves.
          The ant-eater, which is the third variety, is &s;till &s;maller than either of
          the former, as it is not above &s;even inches from the tip of the &s;nout to
          the in&s;ertion of the tail. The two former are of a brown du&s;ky colour, but
          this of a beautiful reddi&s;h, mixed with yel|low; tho' they differ in figure,
          they all re|&s;emble each other in one peculiarity, which is the extreme
          &s;lenderne&s;s of their &s;nout, and the amazing length of their tongue.</P>
<P>The &s;nout is produced in &s;o di&s;proportionate a manner, that
          the length of it makes near a fourth part of the whole figure. A hor&s;e has
          one of the longe&s;t heads of any animal we know, and yet the ant-bear has one
          above twice as long, in proportion to its body. The &s;nout of this animal is
          almo&s;t round and cylindrical; it is extremely &s;lender, and is &s;carce
          thicker near the eyes than at its extremity. The mouth is very &s;mall, the
          no&s;trils are very clo&s;e to each other, the eyes are little, in proportion
          to the length of the no&s;e, the neck is &s;hort, the tongue is extremely long,
          &s;lender, and flatted on both &s;ides; this it keeps generally doubled up in
          the mouth, and is the only in&s;trument by <PB N="340" REF="458"> which it

          teeth, and find &s;afety only in the remotene&s;s and &s;ecurity of their
          retreat.</P>
<P>If we examine through the various regions of the earth, we &s;hall
          find that all the mo&s;t active, &s;prightly,
          <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd u&s;eful quadrupedes have been
          gathered round man, and either &s;erved his plea&s;ures, or &s;till maintained
          their indepen|dence by their vigilance, their cunning, or their indu&s;try. It
          is in the remote &s;olitudes that we are to look for the helple&s;s, the
          deformed, and the mon&s;trous births of nature. The&s;e wretch|ed animals being
          incapable of defending them|&s;elves, either by their agility, or their natural
          arms, fall a prey to every creature that attacks them; they therefore retire
          for &s;afety into the darke&s;t fore&s;ts, or the mo&s;t de&s;art mountains,
          where none of the bolder, or &s;wifter animals chu&s;e to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that an animal &s;o helple&s;s as the
          ant-bear is, with legs too &s;hort to fit it for flight, and unprovided with
          teeth to give it a power of re&s;i&s;tance, is neither nu|merous, nor often
          &s;een; its retreats are in the mo&s;t barren and uncultivated parts of
          South-America. It is a native only of the new con|tinent, and intirely unknown
          to the old. It <PB N="341" REF="459"> lives chiefly in the woods, and hides
          it&s;elf un|der the fallen leaves. It &s;eldom ventures from its retreat, and
          the indu&s;try of an hour &s;up|plies it with &s;ufficient food for &s;everal
          days to|gether. Its manner of procuring its prey, is one of the mo&s;t
          &s;ingular in all natural hi&s;tory; as its name implies, it lives entirely
          upon ants and in&s;ects; the&s;e, in the countries where it is bred, are found
          in the greate&s;t abundance, and often build them&s;elves hills, five or &s;ix
          feet high, where they live in community. When this animal approaches an
          ant-hill, it creeps &s;lowly forward on its belly, taking every pre|caution to
          keep it&s;elf concealed, till it comes within a proper di&s;tance of the place
          where it intends to make its banquet; there lying clo&s;e|ly along at its
          length, it thru&s;ts forth its round red tongue, which is often two feet long,
          acro&s;s the path of the&s;e bu&s;y in&s;ects, and there lets it lye
          motionle&s;s for &s;everal minutes together. The ants of that country, &s;ome
          of which are half an inch long, con&s;idering it as a piece of fle&s;h
          accidentally thrown before them, come forth and &s;warm upon it in great
          numbers, but wherever they touch, they &s;tick; for this in|&s;trument is
          covered with a &s;limy fluid, which like bird-lime, entangles every creature
          that lights upon it. When therefore the ant-bear <PB N="342" REF="460"> has
          found a &s;ufficient number for one mor&s;el, it in&s;tantly draws in the
          tongue, and devours them all in a moment; after which it &s;till con|tinues in
          its po&s;ition, practi&s;ing the &s;ame arts until its hunger is entirely
          appea&s;ed; it then retires to its hiding-place once more, where it continues
          in indolent exi&s;tence, till again excited by the calls of hunger.</P>
<P>Such is the luxurious life of a creature, that &s;eems of all others
          the mo&s;t helple&s;s and deformed. It finds &s;afety in its hiding-places from
          its enemies, and an ample &s;up|ply in &s;ome neighbouring ant-hill, for all
          its appetites. As it only tries to avoid its pur|&s;uers, it is &s;eldom
          di&s;covered by them; yet helple&s;s as this animal is, when driven to an
          extremity, though without teeth, it will fight with its claws, with great
          ob&s;tinacy. With the&s;e arms alone, it has often been found to oppo&s;e the
          dog, and even the Jaguar. It throws it&s;elf upon its back, fa&s;|tens upon its
          enemy with all its claws, &s;ticks with great &s;trength and per&s;everance,
          and even after killing its invader, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, does not

          from which the other differs only in the &s;light particulars above-mentioned,
          and in being rather more active, is of about the &s;ize of a badger. Its fur is
          coar&s;e and &s;taring, &s;ome|what re&s;embling dried gra&s;s; the tail very
          &s;hort, and &s;carce appearing; the mouth extending from ear to ear; the eye
          dull and heavy; the feet armed with three claws each, and made &s;o &s;hort,
          and &s;et on &s;o aukwardly, that a few paces is often the journey of a week;
          but though the feet are &s;hort, they are &s;till longer than its legs, and
          the&s;e proceed from the body in &s;uch an oblique direction, that the &s;ole
          of the foot &s;eldom touches the ground. When the animal therefore is compelled
          to make a &s;tep forward, it &s;crapes on the back of the nails along the
          &s;urface, and wheeling the limbs circularly about, yet &s;till touching the
          ground, it at length places its foot in a progre&s;&s;ive po&s;ition; the other
          three limbs are all brought about with the &s;ame dif|ficulty; and thus it is
          &s;een to move, not above three feet in an hour. In fact, this poor crea|ture

<P><PB N="345" REF="466">The &s;loth &s;eems to be the meane&s;t and
          mo&s;t ill-formed of all tho&s;e animals that chew the cud; it lives entirely
          upon vegetable food, on the leaves, the fruit, and the flowers of trees, and
          often even on the very bark, when nothing el&s;e is left on the tree for its
          &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Like all other ruminant animals, it has four &s;tomachs; and
          the&s;e requiring a large &s;hare of provi&s;ion to &s;upply them, it generally
          &s;trips a tree of all its verdure in le&s;s than a fortnight. Still how|ever
          it keeps aloft, unwilling to de&s;cend, while any thing remains that can
          &s;erve it for food; it therefore falls to devouring the bark, and thus in a
          &s;hort time kills the tree upon which it found its &s;upport. Thus de&s;titute
          of pro|vi&s;ions above, and crawling &s;lowly from branch to branch, in hopes
          of finding &s;omething &s;till left, it is at la&s;t obliged to encounter all
          the dangers that attend it below. Though it is formed by nature for climbing a
          tree with great pain and difficulty, yet it is utterly unable to de&s;cend; it
          therefore is obliged to drop from the branches to the ground, and as it is
          inca|pable of exerting it&s;elf to break the violence of its de&s;cent, it
          drops like a &s;hapele&s;s heavy ma&s;s, and feels no &s;mall &s;hock in the
          fall. There, after remaining &s;ome time torpid, it prepares for a journey to
          &s;ome neighbouring tree; but <PB N="346" REF="467"> this of all migrations is
          the mo&s;t tedious, dan|gerous, and painful; it often takes a week in crawling
          to a tree not fifty yards di&s;tant; it moves with imperceptible &s;lowne&s;s,
          and often baits by the way. All motions &s;eem to torture it, every &s;tep it
          takes it &s;ets forth a mo&s;t plaintive, melancholy cry, which from &s;ome
          di&s;tant &s;imilitude to the human voice, excites a kind of di&s;gu&s;t, mixed
          with pity. This plaintive &s;ound &s;eems its chief defence, few quadrupedes
          appear willing to interrupt its pro|gre&s;s, either that the fle&s;h is
          offen&s;ive, or that they are terrified at its cries. When at length they reach
          their de&s;tined tree, they mount it with much greater ea&s;e than when they
          moved upon the plain. They fall to with fami&s;hed appetite, and as before,
          de&s;troy the very &s;ource that &s;upplies them.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e may be con&s;idered as the un|fini&s;hed productions
          of nature, I will not take upon me to determine; if we mea&s;ure their
          happine&s;s by our &s;en&s;ations, nothing, it is cer|tain, can be more
          mi&s;erable; but it is probable, con&s;idered with regard to them&s;elves, they
          may have &s;ome &s;tores of comfort unknown to us, which may &s;et them upon a

          a larger portion of plenty, indolence, and &s;afety. In fact, they are formed
          very differently from all other quadrupedes, and it is probable, they have
          different enjoy|ments. Like birds, they have but one com|mon vent for the
          purpo&s;es of propagation, excrement, and urine. Like the tortoi&s;e, which
          they re&s;emble, in the &s;lowne&s;s of their motion, they continue to live
          &s;ome time af|ter their nobler parts are wounded, or even taken away. They
          bear the marks of all tho&s;e comely-formed animals, that like rude machines

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. The Gerbua.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal as little re&s;embles a qua|drupede, as that which has
          been de&s;cribed in a former chapter. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a bird,
          dive&s;ted of its feathers, and walking upon its legs, it might give us &s;ome
          idea of its figure. It has four feet indeed, but in running or re&s;ting, it
          never makes u&s;e of any but the hinder. The number of legs, however, do not
          much contribute to any animal's &s;peed; and the gerbua, though pro|perly
          &s;peaking, furni&s;hed but with two, is one of the &s;wifte&s;t creatures in
          the world.</P>
<P>The gerbua is not above the &s;ize of a large rat, and its head is
          &s;loped &s;omewhat in the manner of a rabbit, the teeth al&s;o are formed like
          tho&s;e of the rat kind, there being two cutting teeth in each jaw; it has a
          very long tail, tufted at the end; the head, the back, and &s;ides are covered
          with large a&s;h-coloured &s;oft hair; the brea&s;t and belly is whiti&s;h, but
          what mo&s;t de|&s;erves <PB N="350" REF="471"> our attention in the formation
          of this lit|tle animal, is the legs; the fore-legs are not an inch long, with
          four claws and a thumb upon each, while the hinder-legs are two inches and a
          quarter, and exactly re&s;emble tho&s;e of a bird, there being but three toes,
          the middlemo&s;t of which is longe&s;t.</P>
<P>The gerbua is found in Egypt, Barbary, Pa|le&s;tine, and the
          de&s;arts between Bu&s;&s;erah and Aleppo; its hind-legs, as was &s;aid before,
          are only u&s;ed in running, while the fore-paws, like tho&s;e of a &s;quirrel,
          gra&s;p its food, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure perform the office of hands. It is
          of|ten &s;een by travellers as they pa&s;s along the de&s;arts, cro&s;&s;ing
          their way, and jumping &s;ix or eight feet at every bound, and going &s;o
          &s;wiftly, that &s;carce any other quadrupede is able to over|take them. They
          are a lively, harmle&s;s race of animals, living entirely upon vegetables, and
          burrowing like rabbits in the ground. Mr. Pennant tells us of two that were
          lately brought to London, that burrowed almo&s;t through the brick wall of the
          room where they were kept; they came out of their hole at night for food, and
          when caught, were much fatter and &s;licker than when confined to their
          burrows. A variety of this animal is found al&s;o in Siberia and
          Cir|ca&s;&s;ia, and is mo&s;t probably, common enough <PB N="351" REF="473">
          over all A&s;ia. They are more expert diggers than even the rabbit it&s;elf;
          and when pur&s;ued for a long time, if they cannot e&s;cape by their
          &s;wiftne&s;s, they try to make a hole in&s;tantly in the ground, in which they
          often bury them&s;elves deep enough to find &s;ecurity before their pur&s;uers
          come up. Their burrows, in &s;ome places, are &s;o thick, as to be dangerous to
          travellers, the hor&s;es perpetually falling in them. It is a provident little
          animal, and lays up for the winter. It cuts gra&s;s in heaps of a foot
          &s;quare, which when dried, it carries into its burrow, therewith to &s;erve it
          for food, or to keep its young warm during the rigours of the winter.</P>
<P>But of all animals of this kind, that which was fir&s;t di&s;covered
          and de&s;cribed by Mr. Banks, is the mo&s;t extraordinary. He calls it the
          kan|guroo; and though from its general outline, and the mo&s;t &s;triking
          peculiarities of its figure, it greatly re&s;embles the gerbua, yet it entirely
          differs, if we con&s;ider its &s;ize, or tho&s;e minute di&s;tinctions which
          direct the makers of &s;y&s;tems in a&s;&s;orting the general ranks of
          nature.</P>
<P>The large&s;t of the gerbua kind which are to be found in the
          ancient continent, do not ex|ceed the &s;ize of a rabbit. The kanguroo of New
          Holland, where it is only to be found, is <PB N="351" REF="475">
          <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="352" REF="476"> often
          known to weigh above &s;ixty pounds, and mu&s;t con&s;equently be as large as a
          &s;heep. Al|though the &s;kin of that which was &s;tuffed and brought home by
          Mr. Banks, was not much above the &s;ize of a hare, yet it was greatly
          &s;uperiour to any of the gerbua kind that have been hitherto known, and very
          different in ma|ny particulars. The &s;nout of the gerbua, as has been &s;aid,
          is &s;hort and round, that of the new-di&s;covered animal long and &s;lender;
          the teeth al&s;o entirely differ; for as the gerbua has but two cutting teeth
          in each jaw, making four in all, this animal, be&s;ides its cutting teeth, has
          four canine teeth al&s;o; but what makes a more &s;triking peculiarity, is the
          formation of its low|er jaw, which, as the ingenious di&s;coverer
          &s;up|po&s;es, is divided into two parts, which open and &s;hut like a pair of
          &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and cut gra&s;s, probably this animal's principal food. The
          head, neck, and &s;houlders are very &s;mall in proportion to the other parts
          of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and
          tapering towards the end, the &s;kin is covered with a &s;hort fur, excepting
          the head and the ears, which bear a &s;light re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the
          hare. We are not told, how|ever, from the formation of its &s;tomach, to what
          cla&s;s of quadrupedes it belongs, from its eating <PB N="353" REF="477">
          gra&s;s, which it has been &s;een to do; one would be apt to rank it among the
          ruminant animals, but from the canine teeth which it is found to have, we may
          on the other hand &s;uppo&s;e it to bear &s;ome relation to the carnivorous.
          Upon the whole, however, it can be cla&s;&s;ed with none more properly, than
          with animals of the ger|bua kind, as its hind legs are &s;o much longer than
          the fore; it moves al&s;o preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner, taking great bounds
          of ten or twelve feet at a time, and thus &s;ometimes e&s;cap|ing even the
          fleete&s;t greyhound, with which Mr. Banks pur&s;ued it. One of them, that was
          killed, proved to be good food; but a &s;econd, which weighed eighty-four
          pounds, and was not yet come to its full growth, was found to be much
          inferior.</P>
<P>With this la&s;t de&s;cribed and la&s;t di&s;covered animal, I
          &s;hall conclude the hi&s;tory of quadru|pedes, which of all parts of natural
          knowledge &s;eems to have been de&s;cribed the mo&s;t accurate|ly. As the&s;e,
          from their figure, as well as their &s;agacity, bear the neare&s;t
          re&s;emblance to man, and from their u&s;es or enmities are the mo&s;t
          re&s;pectable parts of the inferior creation, &s;o it was his intere&s;t, and
          his plea&s;ure, to make him|&s;elf acquainted with their hi&s;tory. It is
          proba|ble therefore that time, which enlarges the &s;phere 
          <PB N="354" REF="478"> of our knowledge in other parts of learning, can add but
          very little to this. The addition of a new quadrupede to the catalogue already
          known, is of no &s;mall con&s;equence, and hap|pens but &s;eldom; for the
          number of all is &s;o few, that wherever a new one is found, it becomes an
          object worthy our be&s;t attention. It may take refuge in its native de&s;arts
          from our pur&s;uits, but not from our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>But it is very different with the inferior ranks of the creation;
          the cla&s;&s;es of birds, of fi&s;hes, and of in&s;ects, are all much more
          nume|rous, and more incompletely known. The quadrupede is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
          no arts of e&s;caping, which we are not able to overcome; but the bird removes
          it&s;elf by its &s;wiftne&s;s, the fi&s;hes find protection in their native
          element, and in|&s;ects are &s;ecured in their minutene&s;s, num|bers, and
          variety. Of all the&s;e therefore, we have but a very inadequate catalogue, and
          though the li&s;t be already very large, yet every hour is adding to its
          extent.</P>
<P>In fact, all knowledge is plea&s;ant only as the object of it
          contributes to render man happy, and the &s;ervices of quadrupedes being &s;o
          very nece&s;&s;ary to him in every &s;ituation, he is particularly intere&s;ted
          in their hi&s;tory: with|out their aid, what a wretched and forlorn 
          <PB N="355" REF="479"> creature would he have been! the principal part of his
          food, his cloathing, and his amu&s;ements are derived wholly from them, and he
          may be con&s;idered as a great lord, &s;ometimes cheri&s;h|ing his humble
          dependants, and &s;ometimes ter|rifying the refractory, to contribute to his
          de|light and conveniencies.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e and the a&s;s, the elephant, the ca|mel, the lama, and
          the rein-deer, contribute to ea&s;e his fatigues, and to give him that
          &s;wiftne&s;s which he wants from nature. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he changes
          place without labour; he attains health without wearine&s;s; his pride is
          inlarged by the elegance of equipage, and other animals are pur&s;ued with a
          certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. It were happy indeed for man, if while converting
          the&s;e quadrupedes to his own benefit, he had not turned them to the
          de&s;truction of his fellow-creatures; he has employed &s;ome of them for the
          purpo&s;es of war, and they have conformed to his noxious ambition with but too
          fatal an obedience.</P>
<P>The cow, the &s;heep, the deer, and all their varieties, are
          nece&s;&s;ary to him, though in a dif|ferent manner. Their fle&s;h makes the
          princi|pal luxuries of his table, and their wool or &s;kins the chief ornament
          of his per&s;on. Even tho&s;e nations that are forbid to touch 
          <PB N="356" REF="480"> any thing that has life, cannot wholly di&s;pen&s;e with
          their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The milk of the&s;e ani|mals makes a principal part of
          the food of every country, and often repairs tho&s;e con&s;ti|tutions that have
          been broken by di&s;ea&s;e or intemperance.</P>
<P>The dog, the cat, and the ferret, may be con&s;idered as having
          de&s;erted from their fellow-quadrupedes, to li&s;t them&s;elves under the
          con|duct and protection of man. At his command they exert all their &s;ervices
          again&s;t &s;uch ani|mals as they are capable of de&s;troying, and follow them
          into places where he him&s;elf wants abilities to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>As there is thus a numerous tribe, that he has taken into
          protection, and that &s;up|plies his nece&s;&s;ities and amu&s;ements, &s;o
          there is al&s;o a &s;till more numerous one, that wages an unequal combat
          again&s;t him, and thus call forth his courage and his indu&s;try. Were it not
          for the lion, the tyger, the panther, the rhinoceros, and the bear, he would
          &s;carce know his own powers, and the &s;uperiority of human art over brutal
          fiercene&s;s. The&s;e &s;erve to excite, and put his nobler pa&s;&s;ions into
          motion. He attacks them in their retreat, faces them with re&s;olution, and
          &s;eldom fails of coming off with a victory. He thus be|comes 
          <PB N="357" REF="481"> hardier and better in the &s;truggle, and learns to know
          and to value his own &s;upe|riority.</P>
<P>As the la&s;t mentioned animals are called forth by his bolde&s;t
          efforts, &s;o the numerous tribe of the &s;maller vermin kind excite his
          continual vigilance and caution; his various arts and powers have been no where
          more manife&s;t, than in the extirpation of tho&s;e that multiply with &s;uch
          prodigious fecundity. Neither their agility nor their minutene&s;s can &s;ecure
          them from his pur&s;uits; and though they may infe&s;t, they are &s;eldom found
          materially to injure him.</P>
<P>In this manner we &s;ee, that not only human want is &s;upplied, but
          that human wit is &s;har|pened, by the humbler partners of man in the creation.
          By this we &s;ee, that not only their benefits, but their depredations are
          u&s;eful, and that it has wi&s;ely plea&s;ed Providence to place us like
