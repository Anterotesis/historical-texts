<HEAD>THE LIFE OF BERNARD GILPIN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>BERNARD GILPIN was born in the year 1517, about the middle of the reign of Henry the eighth. His forefathers had been &s;eated at Kentmire-hall, in We&s;tmoreland, from the time of king John; in who&s;e reign this e&s;tate had been given by a baron of Kendal to Richard Gil|pin, as a reward for &s;ervices thought very con&s;iderable. Carleton, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who wrote the life of Bernard Gilpin, men|tions this Richard as a per&s;on eminent in his
<PB N="2" REF="4">time, both in a civil and military capacity; and gives us a &s;tory, told indeed with a fa|bulous air, of his killing a wild boar, which terribly infe&s;ted tho&s;e parts. From this gentleman the e&s;tate of Kentmire de&s;cended to the father of Bernard, Edwin Gilpin; who became prematurely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it by the death of an elder brother, killed at the battle of Bo&s;worth; in the cau&s;e, mo&s;t pro|bably, of Richard the third, who&s;e gallant behaviour, and very popular government, a few years before in Scotland, had e&s;tabli&s;hed him greatly in the e&s;teem of the northern counties.</P>
<P>Edwin Gilpin had &s;everal children, of which Bernard was one of the younge&s;t; an unhappy circum&s;tance in that age, which, giving little encouragement to the liberal arts, and le&s;s to commerce, re&s;trained the genius and indu&s;try of younger brothers. No way indeed was commonly open to their fortunes, but the church or the camp. The incon|venience however was le&s;s to Mr. Gilpin than to others; for that way was open, to which his di&s;po&s;ition mo&s;t led him. From his earlie&s;t youth he was inclined to a con|templative
<PB N="3" REF="5">life, thoughtful, re&s;erved, and &s;e|rious. Perhaps no one ever had a greater &s;hare of con&s;titutional virtue, or through every part of life endeavoured more to im|prove it.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter hath pre&s;erved a &s;tory of him in his infancy, which will &s;hew how early he could di&s;cern not only the immorality, but the indecorum of an action.</P>
<P>A begging frier came on a &s;aturday evening to his father's hou&s;e; where, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times, he was received in a very ho&s;pitable manner. The plenty &s;et before him was a temptation too &s;trong for his virtue; of which, it &s;eems, he had not &s;ufficient even to &s;ave appearances. The next morning however he ordered the bell to toll, and from the pulpit expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with great vehemence again&s;t the debauchery of the times, and particularly again&s;t drunkenne&s;s. Mr. Gilpin, who was then a child upon his mother's knee, &s;eemed for &s;ome time exceedingly affected with the frier's di&s;cour&s;e, and at length, with the ut|mo&s;t indignation, cried out, 'He wondered
<PB N="4" REF="6">how that man could preach again&s;t drunken|ne&s;s, when he him&s;elf had been drunk only the night before.'</P>
<P>In&s;tances of this kind &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and gave his parents an early pre&s;age of his future piety.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t years were &s;pent at a public &s;chool; where, agreeably to the compliment which hi&s;tory generally pays &s;uch as afterwards be|come eminent, we are told he &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From &s;chool he was removed to Oxford, where it was judged learning was mo&s;t en|couraged: though indeed both the univer|&s;ities were in that age greatly over-run with ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, effects of the &s;lavi&s;h opinions then prevailing in religion; and what &s;tudy was encouraged was con|fined to perplexed &s;y&s;tems of logic, and the &s;ubtilties of &s;chool divinity. So that the be&s;t education of tho&s;e times was only calculated for very &s;lender improvements in real learn|ing.</P>
<P>At the age however of &s;ixteen, Mr. Gil|pin was entered, upon the foundation, at Queen's college in Oxford; where we are
<PB N="5" REF="7">informed his indu&s;try was very great, and ea&s;ily reaped what knowledge the &s;oil pro|duced.</P>
<P>Era&s;mus about this time drew the atten|tion of the learned world. With a noble freedom he &s;hook off the prejudices of his education, boldly attacked the reigning &s;u|per&s;titions of popery, and expo&s;ed the lazy and illiterate churchmen of tho&s;e days. Such a behaviour could not but procure him many enemies; and occa&s;ioned objec|tions to whatever he could write. At Ox|ford particularly he was far from being in general e&s;teem. Our young &s;tudent had however too much of the true &s;pirit of a &s;cholar to take any thing upon tru&s;t, or to be prejudiced again&s;t an author from popular exceptions. Without li&s;tening therefore to what was &s;aid, he took Era&s;mus into his hands, and quickly di&s;covered in him a trea&s;ure of real learning, which he had in vain &s;ought after in the writings then mo&s;t in e&s;teem.</P>
<P>But as he had now determined to apply him&s;elf to divinity, he made the &s;criptures his chief &s;tudy; and &s;et him&s;elf with great
<PB N="6" REF="8">indu&s;try upon gaining a thorough know|ledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages; in the &s;tudy of which he was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Neal, a fellow of New-college, and afterwards profe&s;&s;or of Hebrew in Oxford.</P>
<P>He had not been long in the univer&s;ity, before he was taken notice of. He was looked upon as a young man of good parts, and con&s;iderable learning; and they who were not &s;o well qualified to judge in either of the&s;e points, admired and loved him for a remarkable &s;weetne&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, and unaffected &s;incerity in his manners. At the u&s;ual term he took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, and about the &s;ame time was elected fellow of his college.</P>
<P>The reformed doctrines had hitherto made no progre&s;s in England; and, as Mr. Gilpin had been bred up in the Romi&s;h church, he &s;till continued a member of it. But though in appearance he was not di&s;&s;atified with popery, yet it is not improbable that at this time he had his &s;u&s;picions of it. The writ|ings of Era&s;mus had put him upon freer in|quiries than were common in tho&s;e days. He had the di&s;cretion however to keep to
<PB N="7" REF="9">him&s;elf whatever doubts they might have rai&s;ed in him; and before he &s;aid any thing which might &s;hake the faith of others, he determined to e&s;tabli&s;h his own.</P>
<P>He had not been long &s;ettled in his fellow|&s;hip, before a very public te&s;timony was gi|ven to the reputation he had acquired.</P>
<P>Cardinal Wol&s;ey was now at the head of the affairs of England; a mini&s;ter, who not|with&s;tanding his many vices, would &s;ome|times entertain a noble de&s;ign. He &s;aw the corrupt &s;tate of monkery in the nation, was &s;candalized at it, and began to think of &s;ome method to check its progre&s;s. The mona&s;tic revenues he was convinced might ea&s;ily be applied to better u&s;es; particularly in rai&s;ing the credit of the two univer&s;ities. He was re&s;olved therefore to make a trial; and with this view obtained bulls for the &s;upre&s;|&s;ion of &s;everal mona&s;teries. Being thus en|abled to carry on his de&s;ign, he laid the foundation of Chri&s;t-church college in Ox|ford, and about this time fini&s;hed it. But his care extending farther than a mere en|dowment, he had his agents in many of the univer&s;ities in Europe, to procure him
<PB N="8" REF="10">men of eminence, whom he might tran&s;plant thither; and copies of the be&s;t books then extant: for he de&s;igned that his college &s;hould be the means of the re&s;toration of learning in England. Mr. Gilpin's character was then &s;o great, that he was one of the fir&s;t in Oxford to whom the cardinal's agents applied. He accepted their propo&s;al, and removed to Chri&s;t-church.</P>
<P>Here he continued his former &s;tudies; from the nature of which, and the ingenuity and hone&s;ty of his di&s;po&s;ition, it is highly probable he would in time have been led by his own rea&s;onings to that di&s;covery of truth he aimed at; but providence rewarded a pious endeavour, by throwing in his way the means of an earlier attainment of it.</P>
<P>King Henry the eighth was now dead; and his young &s;ucce&s;&s;or began in earne&s;t to &s;upport that cau&s;e, which his father had only &s;o far encouraged as it contributed to reple|ni&s;h an exhau&s;ted exchequer, and break a yoke which &s;at unea&s;y upon him. Under this prince's patronage Peter Martyr went to Oxford, where he read divinity-lectures in a &s;train to which the univer&s;ity had been hi|therto
<PB N="9" REF="11">little accu&s;tomed. He began with the corporal pre&s;ence; the refutation of which error, as it was one of the earlie&s;t of popery, he thought would much &s;hock the credit of the Romi&s;h church. This was looked upon as an open declaration of war. The bigot|ed were immediately in flame: 'If the&s;e novelties prevailed, the peace of the church was at an end&mdash;nothing but confu&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue&mdash;religion was utterly ruined.' While this was the popular clamour, the heads of the popi&s;h party began to rou&s;e from an in|dolence they had long indulged, and to &s;et about a more formidable oppo&s;ition. The chief of them were Ched&s;ey, Morgan, and Tre&s;ham; men not unlearned for the times, but who&s;e bigotry at lea&s;t kept pace with their learning.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this religious war is foreign to our purpo&s;e. We are no otherwi&s;e con|cerned in it, than as it relates to Mr. Gilpin. His credit in the univer&s;ity was then, it &s;eems, &s;o con&s;iderable, that we find the popi&s;h party very &s;olicitous to engage him to &s;ide pub|licly with them; and the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing ap|plications were accordingly made. But they
<PB N="10" REF="12">found his zeal of a much cooler temper than their own. He was not indeed &s;atisfied with the reformers, having wanted hitherto the opportunities of acquainting him&s;elf with their arguments: but, on the other hand, he had never been a bigoted papi&s;t; and had, it &s;eems, lately di&s;covered, through a di&s;pute he had been engaged in with Dr. Hooper, afterwards bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, that &s;everal of the Romi&s;h doctrines were not &s;o well &s;upported by &s;cripture as was commonly imagined. While his mind was in &s;o un&s;ettled a condition, he thought him|&s;elf but ill qualified to e&s;pou&s;e either &s;ide publicly. His inclination rather led him to &s;tand by, an unprejudiced ob&s;erver; and to embrace truth, whether he found her among prote&s;tants or papi&s;ts. Such importunity was however u&s;ed with him, that at length he yielded, which was matter of no &s;mall triumph to his party; and he appeared the next day again&s;t Peter Martyr.</P>
<P>Entering thus into a controver&s;y again&s;t his inclination, he determined however to make it as u&s;eful to him&s;elf as he could. By bringing his old opinions to the te&s;t, he hop|ed
<PB N="11" REF="13">at lea&s;t he might di&s;cover, whether it was only the &s;tamp of antiquity upon them, or their own intrin&s;ic worth, that gave them that value at which they had been hitherto rated. He re&s;olved therefore to lay a&s;ide, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the temper of a caviller; and to place truth before him as the &s;ole ob|ject of his pur&s;uit, from which he was de|termined to be drawn a&s;ide neither by pre|judice nor by novelty.</P>
<P>But he &s;oon found his adver&s;ary's argu|ments too &s;trong for him: they came au|thorized from the holy writings in &s;o for|cible a manner, that he could not but ac|knowledge them of a nature quite different from the wire-drawn proofs, and &s;trained in|terpretations of &s;cripture, in which he had hitherto acquie&s;ced. We need not there|fore wonder, if the di&s;putation was &s;oon over. Mr. Gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart, through which men often defend &s;u&s;pected opinions; but gave up his cau&s;e with that grace which always attends &s;ince|rity. He owned publicly, that he could not maintain it; and determined to enter into
<PB N="12" REF="14">no more controver&s;ies, till he had gained the full information he was in pur&s;uit of.</P>
<P>This ingenuous regard for truth was &s;hewn in the more advantageous light by the bigot|ry of his fellow-di&s;putants; who&s;e inflamed zeal, and fiercene&s;s of temper, di&s;covered little of the &s;cholar, and le&s;s of the chri&s;tian. In his conduct appeared an hone&s;t de&s;ire of information only; in theirs, the pride of op|po&s;ition &s;truggling again&s;t conviction.</P>
<P>Peter Martyr took notice of this difference of behaviour, and would frequently &s;ay, that, 'As for Ched&s;ey, Morgan, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e hot-headed zealots, he could not in truth be much concerned about them; but Mr. Gilpin &s;eemed a man of &s;uch upright|ne&s;s of intention, and &s;o much &s;incerity, both in his words and actions, that it went to his heart to &s;ee him &s;till involved in prejudice and error. The re&s;t, he thought, were only a trifling, light &s;ort of men, led into an op|po&s;ition more by vain glory, and a de&s;ire to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, than through any bet|ter motives; but Mr. Gilpin's ingenuity of behaviour, and irreproachable life, left room for no &s;uch &s;u&s;picion with regard to him;
<PB N="13" REF="15">and he could not but own, he con&s;idered his e&s;pou&s;ing any cau&s;e as a very great credit to it.' He would often likewi&s;e tell his friends, 'It was the &s;ubject of his daily prayers, that God would be plea&s;ed at length to touch the heart of this pious papi&s;t with the know|ledge of true religion.'&mdash;And he prayed not in vain; for Mr. Gilpin, from this time, be|came every day more reconciled to the re|formers.</P>
<P>Having been thus &s;taggered by his adver|&s;ary's arguments, the fir&s;t &s;tep he took, after he had implored the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was to recollect, and carefully commit to paper, the &s;ub&s;tance of what had pa&s;&s;ed in this contro|ver&s;y; and of tho&s;e points, in which he had been harde&s;t pre&s;&s;ed, he re&s;olved to enter into a &s;tricter examination.</P>
<P>But before he could reconcile him&s;elf to this work, many di&s;tracting &s;cruples aro&s;e in his mind. Though he could not but di&s;|cover &s;omething que&s;tionable in many of his old opinions; yet when he con&s;idered they were &s;till deeply rooted in the minds of al|mo&s;t the whole nation, embraced by the greate&s;t part of Europe, and had been through
<PB N="14" REF="16">many centuries &s;upported by the authority of princes and councils, he thought great de|ference was due to &s;o awful a majority, and could not without much perplexity, think of making his own private judgment a te&s;t of the public faith. His &s;u&s;picions however forced him at length upon an examination; though with a de&s;ign, it is probable, to con|firm, rather than confute his old opinions. But he &s;oon found that an impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k. The more he con&s;idered the tenets of popery, the le&s;s defen&s;ible they appeared. If he tried them by rea&s;on, he found them utterly un|able to &s;tand that proof; and if he endea|voured to reconcile them with &s;cripture, he could not but ob&s;erve, by what unnatural in|terpretations it was only to be effected.</P>
<P>He endeavoured likewi&s;e to acquaint him|&s;elf with the hi&s;tory of popery, that he might di&s;cover in what age its &s;everal que&s;tioned doctrines fir&s;t appeared. From this &s;earch into antiquity he ob&s;erved, that none of them obtained in the earlier and purer ages of the Chri&s;tian church, but were all the inventions of later times, when ignorance and credulity prevailed, and gave &s;ufficient opportunity for
<PB N="15" REF="17">de&s;igning men to e&s;tabli&s;h any creed that &s;uited them.</P>
<P>Seven &s;acraments, he found, had never been heard of before the time of Peter Lom|bard; which was above eleven hundred years after Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The denial of the cup to the laity appear|ed plainly a doctrine intended, in corrupt times, to give a my&s;terious &s;uperiority to the clergy. No traces of it could be found till near a thou&s;and years after the &s;acrament was fir&s;t in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation took its ri&s;e indeed &s;ooner; but not however till the eighth century; at which time al&s;o the notion of the lord's &s;upper being a propitia|tory &s;acrifice was fir&s;t heard of.</P>
<P>Very late al&s;o appeared the doctrine of an action's being morally good, without any re|gard to the intention of the doer; commonly called the doctrine of the opus operatum. It &s;eemed plainly intended for no other end but to enrich its teachers.</P>
<P>Thus, into whatever part of popery he ex|amined, he found great abu&s;es: the true &s;im|plicity and &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity were gone;
<PB N="16" REF="18">totally lo&s;t in mere human inventions. But what he fir&s;t began to object to in the popi&s;h creed, and was mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted at, were in|dulgences, prayers before images, and di&s;al|lowing the public u&s;e of the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>The rites and ceremonies of the Romi&s;h church plea&s;ed him as little as its doctrines: many of them appeared trifling; many of them ridiculous; and not a few plainly impious. That affected o&s;tentation, and theatrical pomp, which accompanied them all, &s;eemed a &s;trange deviation from the &s;implicity of apo&s;tolic times; and had, he could not but ob&s;erve, the wor&s;t influence upon the people, as it led them from the practice of virtue, to put their tru&s;t in outward performances.</P>
<P>They, who have been bred up in a purer religion, may perhaps wonder, that a man of &s;o much &s;en&s;e and learning, and e&s;pecially of &s;o much hone&s;ty and &s;incerity, needed &s;o long a cour&s;e of rea&s;oning to di&s;cover errors of &s;o gro&s;s a kind. But if his conduct may not be accounted for by prejudice, it was however &s;uch as will always be expected from a fair mind in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.
<PB N="17" REF="19">The matter under his con&s;ideration was of the la&s;t importance; it required therefore the utmo&s;t caution. His good &s;en&s;e led him early to doubt; yet, con&s;idering what an e&s;tabli&s;hed creed his doubts oppo&s;ed, his hu|mility made tho&s;e very doubts &s;u&s;pected. He knew not indeed how to proceed: he was di&s;tracted by a thou&s;and &s;cruples: the fault might be in him&s;elf&mdash;or, it might be in his religion&mdash;papi&s;t and prote&s;ant could not both be in the right&mdash;either might be in the wrong&mdash;yet each had &s;omething to &s;ay that was plau&s;ible. He hoped however that a merciful God would regard the diffi|culties he had to &s;truggle with, and exact nothing from him beyond his power&mdash;every thing in his power he was determined to do. Agreeably to this re&s;olution, he went on with the examination of religious matters, omitting nothing that could contribute to his due in|formation.</P>
<P>While he was engaged in this work, an event happened, which greatly advanced it, by giving the la&s;t &s;hock to his prejudices in favour of popery.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">Europe had now been &s;o long di&s;tracted by religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions, that it was univer&s;ally, thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon a general coun|cil, which might deliberate on the be&s;t ex|pedients to remove them. This prevailing de&s;ire was li&s;tened to very heedle&s;ly at Rome. A &s;crutiny into religious matters was an alarm|ing thing to every true papi&s;t. The con&s;e|quence was ea&s;ily fore&s;een; and the prudent pope was very unwilling to have the pool &s;tirred, le&s;t it &s;hould become too evident how much it wanted clean&s;ing. But di&s;content and clamour running high, and nothing ap|pearing likely to appea&s;e the univer&s;al mur|mur but a council, one was at length conven|ed at Trent. The pope had now recour&s;e to an after-game. Since he could not avoid this dreaded council, he contrived however to ma|nage the members of it with &s;uch addre&s;s, that his power, far from being &s;haken by them, was in fact only the more confirmed. In&s;tead of repairing what was decayed, their only care was to prop the old ruin as it &s;tood. But among all the mea&s;ures then taken in &s;upport of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, the compleate&s;t was a bold decree, that the traditions of the church
<PB N="19" REF="21">&s;hould be e&s;teemed of equal authority with the &s;criptures them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A determination of &s;o extraordinary a na|ture was received with a&s;toni&s;hment by all well-wi&s;hers to religion. 'The opportunity (the reformers every where cried out is now lo&s;t! Since traditions are equalled with &s;crip|ture, and the&s;e traditions are in the hands of the conclave, it cannot be doubted who&s;e &s;en&s;e they will always &s;peak. The Roman|i&s;ts have now a fund of authority for all their extravagancies. Alas! in&s;tead of &s;topping the breach, they have now &s;o far widened it, as to de&s;troy all hope of its ever clo&s;ing again.'</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin, among the re&s;t, took great offence at the&s;e proceedings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some time after the publication of the council of Trent, Mr. Lever, falling into conver&s;ation with Mr. Gilpin, among other que&s;tions a&s;ked him, What he thought of that council? Mr. Gilpin an&s;wered, 'He thought nothing could be of more di&s;&s;ervice to religion: for many things, which were before left indifferent, were now rendered binding. I remember, &s;aid he, bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal often told me, that he thought Innocent the third acted very weakly, when he made tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion an article of faith. For before his time the opinions of men were at liberty as to that point. And what the bi&s;hop &s;aid of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, may equally be &s;aid of all parts of popery, &s;ince the publication of the council
<PB N="20" REF="22">of Trent. The times of our forefathers, therefore, how|ever ignorant they may be thought, were certainly much happier than the pre&s;ent times of popery: for the papi&s;ts have now altered what little was left of the in&s;titutions of the primitive church: by placing the rule of faith in traditions, they have done what was never thought of be|fore. Many opinions likewi&s;e, which men were before at liberty to hold, with regard to ju&s;tification, and the &s;acraments, are not now tolerated. The&s;e are the things which obliged other churches to di&s;&s;ent from the church of Rome; and hence the council of Trent mu&s;t an&s;wer for all that confu&s;ion which hath &s;ince en&s;ued.' Bi&s;hop Carleton's life of Bernard Gilpin.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="21"></NOTE>. Hitherto,
<PB N="20" REF="22">notwith&s;tanding his objections to popery, there was &s;omething in an e&s;tabli&s;hed church which he knew not how to get over. The word &s;chi&s;m greatly perplexed him: nor could he ea&s;ily per&s;uade him&s;elf of the law|fulne&s;s of a &s;eparation from the church of Rome, corrupt as &s;he was in other re&s;pects, while &s;he profe&s;&s;ed to draw her rule of faith from the &s;criptures. But when he found, by the publication of the council of Trent, that &s;he had carried her authority to &s;uch an height of arrogance as to &s;et up her own un|written word again&s;t the &s;criptures; a word, which, he would often humorou&s;ly &s;ay, 'was in no degree comparable to the word of an honest man;' it was high time, he thought,
<PB N="21" REF="23">for all &s;incere Chri&s;tians to take the alarm. The de&s;igns of the papi&s;ts were now too plain; and if they meant well to religion, they meant it in &s;uch a manner, that a good con&s;cience could not comply with them. For him&s;elf, he was obliged to conclude, from this direct oppo&s;ition of their own authority to the authority of &s;cripture, that their &s;ole view was to e&s;tabli&s;h their declining power: nor could he otherwi&s;e con&s;ider popery than as a per|plexed &s;y&s;tem of prie&s;t-craft, &s;uper&s;tition, and bigotry; a religion converted into a trade, and u&s;ed only as a cloak for the tyranny and ava|rice of its profe&s;&s;ors. In a word, he thought it now &s;ufficiently evident, that the church of Rome was plainly antichri&s;tian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>While he was di&s;tracted with the&s;e things, the rule of faith changed by the council of Trent a&s;toni&s;hed him. For he ob&s;erved, that not only the antient divines, but even the modern ones, Lombard, Scotus, and Aquinas, all confe&s;&s;ed, that the rule of faith was &s;olely to be drawn from &s;cripture: whereas he found, according to the coun|cil of Trent, that it might as well be drawn from human traditions. And when he under&s;tood that the&s;e traditions were only peevi&s;h and perver&s;e interpretations of &s;crip|ture, invented by the bi&s;hops of Rome, and thru&s;t in among the decretal epi&s;tles; and that even the&s;e decretal epi&s;tles them&s;elves were mere forgeries, as had been often proved by learned men, and was acknowledged even by
<PB N="22" REF="24">the papi&s;ts, he began to doubt, e&s;pecially when he ob|&s;erved the great confu&s;ion ari&s;en in the church whether the pope might not be that Antichri&s;t foretold by &s;crip|ture, and the papi&s;h church plainly antichri&s;tian. For what is 'exalting a man's &s;elf, and oppo&s;ing him&s;elf again&s;t all that is called God, &s;o that in the temple of God he &s;itteth as God, carrying him&s;elf as if he were God,' if the pope's calling him&s;elf the head of the univer&s;al church, its lord, its monarch, and &s;etting up his own word again&s;t the word of God, be not &s;o? For he who&s;e word is as God's word, is him&s;elf as God, and carrieth him&s;elf as if he were &s;o. When Antichri&s;t &s;hall come (if there be another Antichri&s;t) is it po&s;&s;ible for him to u&s;e Chri&s;t and the &s;criptures more bla&s;phemou&s;ly than the pope hath done?&mdash;Here Mr. Gilpin demurred, in doubt what to think. For who could have thought the pope was Antichri&s;t? Who dur&s;t have &s;aid &s;uch a thing before Luther?&mdash;Thus therefore he argued with him&s;elf: if the pope be Antichri&s;t, I &s;ee not only a ra|tional, but a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e for &s;ece&s;&s;ion: if he be not, I cannot approve &s;uch a &s;tep. It is not lawful to &s;epa|rate from the church: but to &s;eparate from the church of Antichri&s;t is not only commanded, but threatenings are denounced upon tho&s;e who continue in it. Thus the heavenly voice &s;peaks, Rev. xviii. <Q>Go out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins and receive not of her plagues.</Q>&mdash;Here therefore he &s;topped. For, except the pope were manife&s;tly proved to be Antichri&s;t, he could net allow the lawfulne&s;s of a &s;eparation: and therefore he endeavoured, by reading, meditation, and prayer, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf in this point. He ob&s;erved, that the pa&s;&s;age in which Antichri&s;t is de&s;cribed, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 7. 'He who now keepeth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hall keep, until he
<PB N="23" REF="25">be entirely routed out,' was interpreted by mo&s;t of the an|tient fathers, Tertullian, Jerome, Ambro&s;e, Au&s;tin, Chry|&s;o&s;tome, Cyril, and others, as meant of the Roman em|pire; which being then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould continue &s;o till Antichri&s;t &s;hould come, and entirely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s it. He ob&s;erved al&s;o, that what is &s;aid in the &s;ame place, that 'Chri&s;t &s;hall not come again till there be a departure fir&s;t,' was likewi&s;e fulfilled: it was fulfilled, fir&s;t, in the de|parture of the papi&s;ts from primitive &s;implicity; and, &s;e|condly, in the departure of the reformed churches from the church of Rome.&mdash;Mr. Gilpin would often &s;ay, that the prote&s;tants could give no &s;olid rea&s;on for their &s;ece&s;&s;ion, except that the pope is Antichri&s;t: and he under&s;tood the pa&s;&s;age above mentioned, Rev. xviii. 4. as a &s;trict command in that ca&s;e to &s;ecede: &s;o that no third con|clu&s;ion could be drawn; either the pope was Antichri&s;t, or the church was not to be for&s;aken.&mdash;And now the event, which is the &s;ure&s;t interpreter of prophecies, hath made all things clear to us. We have &s;een, many ages ago, that kingdom taken away which ruled over all in the time of the apo&s;tles; and in its room an eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal kingdom e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;uch an one as had never been heard of before in the church of Chri&s;t. We have &s;een an amazing departure in the church of Rome from the purity and &s;implicity of primitive times. We have &s;een, and daily do &s;ee, a departure of other churches from her.&mdash;The&s;e reflections induced Mr. Gilpin to become a member of that church, which he thought was mo&s;t conformable to the word of God. The church of Rome kept the rule of faith entire, till it was changed by the council of Trent. From that time he thought it a point of duty to for&s;ake her communion; that the true church, thus called out, might follow the word of God. For this &s;eparation &s;eemed an appointed &s;tate of the church.

<P>His more than ordinary candour and &s;in|cerity, through the whole of this affair, met with much applau&s;e, and gained him great e&s;teem. Many years afterwards the earls of Bedford and Leice&s;ter, having heard there was &s;omething very uncommon in his man|ner of proceeding upon this occa&s;ion, want|ed to be more acquainted with the circum|&s;tances of it; and for that purpo&s;e applied to Mr. George Gilpin, Bernard's brother, who was upon terms of great intimacy with tho&s;e two noblemen, and then in London. Ac|cordingly this gentleman, taking the oppor|tunity of a vi&s;it to his friends in the north, per&s;uaded his brother to give him in writing an exact account of the progre&s;s of his change from the Romi&s;h religion.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">Mr. Gilpin's letter upon: this occa&s;ion is &s;till extant.

<Q><P>You require me to write, in a long di&s;|cour&s;e, the manner of my conver&s;ion from &s;uper&s;tition to the light of the go&s;pel; which, I think you know, was not in a few years.

<P>In king Edward's time I was brought to di&s;pute again&s;t &s;ome a&s;&s;ertions of Peter Martyr; altho' I have ever been given to e&s;chew, &s;o far as I might, controver&s;ies and di&s;putations. Being but a young &s;tudent,
<PB N="26" REF="28">and finding my groundwork not &s;o &s;ure as I &s;uppo&s;ed, I went fir&s;t to the bi&s;hop of Durham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuthbert Tun&s;tall.</NOTE>, who told me, that "Innocent the third was much over&s;een, to make tran&s;ub&s;tantiation an article of faith." He found great fault with the pope for indul|gencies, and other things.</P>
<P>After, I went to Dr. Redman, in whom I had great tru&s;t for the fame of his virtue and learning. He told me, "The com|munion-book was very godly, and agree|able to the go&s;pel." The&s;e things made me to mu&s;e.</P>
<P>Afterwards one of the fellows of the Queen's college told me, he heard Dr. Ched&s;ey &s;ay among his friends, "The pro|te&s;tants mu&s;t yield to us in granting the pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the &s;acrament, and we mu&s;t yield to them in the opinion of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation; &s;o &s;hall we accord."</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;ton made a long &s;ermon in de|fence of the communion in both kinds.</P>
<P>Mr. Morgan told me, that Mr. Ware, a man mo&s;t famous both for life and learn|ing,
<PB N="27" REF="29">had told him before his death, that "The chief &s;acrifice of the church of God was the &s;acrifice of thank&s;giving" This was his an&s;wer, when I de&s;ired to know what might be &s;aid for the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s.</P>

<P>Mr. Harding coming newly from Italy, in a long and notable &s;ermon did &s;o lively &s;et forth, and paint in their colours, the friers, and unlearned bi&s;hops a&s;&s;embled at Trent in council, that he much dimini&s;hed in me, and many others, the confidence we had in general councils.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things, and many more, gave me occa&s;ion to &s;earch both the &s;criptures and antient fathers; whereby I began to &s;ee many great abu&s;es, and &s;ome enormities, u&s;ed and maintained in popery; and to like well of &s;undry reformations on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Afterwards, in three years &s;pace, I &s;aw &s;o much gro&s;s idolatry at Paris, Antwerp,
<PB N="28" REF="30">and other places, that made me to mi&s;like more and more the popi&s;h doctrines; e&s;pe|cially becau&s;e the learned men di&s;allowed image-wor&s;hip in their &s;chools, and &s;uffer|ed it &s;o gro&s;ly in their churches.</P>
<P>As I could with &s;mall knowledge, I ex|amined the ma&s;s: the greate&s;t fault I then found was too much reverence and gro&s;s wor&s;hipping of the gaping people; becau&s;e I believed not tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Likewi&s;e my con&s;cience was grieved at the receiving of the prie&s;t alone. Yet at length I &s;aid ma&s;s a few times as clo&s;ely as I could.</P>
<P>I rea&s;oned with certain that were learn|ed of my acquaintance, why there was no reformation of the&s;e gro&s;s enormities about images, reliques, pilgrimages, buy|ing ma&s;s and trentals, with many other things, which in king Edward's time the catholics (&s;o called) did not only grant to be far ami&s;s, but al&s;o promi&s;ed that the church &s;hould be reformed, if ever the au|thority came into their hands again. When I a&s;ked when this reformation was to be|gin, in hope whereof I was the more wil|ling to return from Paris, I was an&s;wered,
<PB N="29" REF="31">"We may not grant to to the ignorant peo|ple, that any of the&s;e things hath been ami&s;s: if we do, they will &s;trait infer other things may be ami&s;s as well as the&s;e, and &s;till go further and further."&mdash;This grieved me, and made me &s;eek for quiet|ne&s;s in God's word: no where el&s;e I could find any &s;tay.</P>
<P>After this, in two or three &s;ermons at Newca&s;tle, I began to utter my con&s;cience more plainly: when thirteen or fourteen articles were drawn up again&s;t me, and &s;ent to the bi&s;hop. Here my adver&s;aries of the clergy, whom I had &s;ore offended by &s;peaking again&s;t their pluralities, had that which they looked for. They cau&s;ed the bi&s;hop to call me in their pre&s;ence, and ex|amine me touching the &s;acrament. The bi&s;hop &s;hewed favour &s;o far, I tru&s;t, as he dur&s;t; urging me nothing with tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, but only with the real pre&s;ence, which I granted, and &s;o was delivered at that time. For the real pre&s;ence, I was not then re&s;olved; but took it to be a my&s;|tery above my capacity: yet my con&s;cience was &s;omewhat wounded for granting be|fore
<PB N="30" REF="32">them in plain words the thing whereof I &s;tood in doubt.</P>
<P>After queen Mary's death I began to ut|ter my mind more plainly. Before (I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s my weakne&s;s) ignorance, and fear of enemies, had &s;omewhat re&s;trained me.</P>
<P>Thus, in proce&s;s of time, I grew to be &s;tronger and &s;tronger; yet many grievous temptations and doubts have I had, which many nights have bereaved me of &s;leep.</P>
<P>My nature hath evermore fled contro|ver&s;y &s;o much as I could. My delight and de&s;ire hath been to preach Chri&s;t, and our &s;alvation by him, in &s;implicity and truth; and to comfort my&s;elf with the &s;weet pro|mi&s;es of the go&s;pel, and in prayer.</P>
<P>I have been always &s;crupulous, and troubled either in &s;ub&s;cribing, or &s;wearing to any thing, be&s;ide the &s;criptures, and ar|ticles of our belief, becau&s;e the &s;cripture ought ever to have a preeminence above man's writings.&mdash;I remember, when I went for orders to the bi&s;hop of Oxford, his chaplain mini&s;tred an oath to allow all &s;uch ordinances as were &s;et forth, or &s;hould
<PB N="31" REF="33">be &s;et forth in time to come: which oath when we con&s;idered better of it, what it was to &s;wear to things to come, we knew not what, it troubled not only me, but nine or ten more with me, men of much better learning than I was. I, for my part, re|&s;olved after that to &s;wear to no writing but with exception, as it agreed with the word of God.&mdash;What trouble I had when the oath was mini&s;tered by the bi&s;hops for the book of articles, agreed upon in 1562 and 1571, I have opened for quietne&s;s and di&s;|charge of my con&s;cience in another writ|ing.&mdash;And certainly, &s;ince I took this or|der to open my faults in writing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In another letter he thus &s;peaks, <Q>I never had doubts in religion in all my life, nor ever di&s;&s;embled in all my life, or committed any fault, which, &s;o far as I thought it might edify, or do good to others, and &s;o far as my remembrance &s;erved, I could not well find in my heart to confe&s;s before all the world.</Q></P></NOTE>, not pau&s;ing who knew them, &s;o it might edify my&s;elf or others, I have found great ea&s;e and quietne&s;s of con&s;cience; and am daily more edified, comforted, and confirmed, in reading the &s;criptures. And this I prai&s;e God for, that when I was mo&s;t troubled,
<PB N="32" REF="34">and weake&s;t of all, my faith in God's mercy was &s;o &s;trong, that if I &s;hould then have departed this life, I had, and have, a &s;ure tru&s;t, that none of the&s;e doubts would have hindered my &s;alvation. I hold fa&s;t one &s;entence of St. Paul, "I have obtained mercy, in that I did it in ignorance:" and another of Job, "If the Lord put me to death, yet will I tru&s;t in him."&mdash;Yet have I prayed God's mercy many times for all the&s;e offences, infirmities, and ignorances; and &s;o I will do &s;till, &s;o long as I have to live in this world.</P></Q>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>WE left Mr. Gilpin at Chri&s;t-church college in Oxford, now fully con|vinced of the errors of popery.</P>
<P>An academic life, affording him mo&s;t lei|&s;ure for &s;tudy, was the life he was mo&s;t in|clined to. He had too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the duty of a clergyman to be unacquainted with the qualifications requi&s;ite for its di&s;charge; and too mean an opinion of him&s;elf to think he was yet ma&s;ter of them. He thought more learning was nece&s;&s;ary in that contro|ver&s;ial age than he had yet acquired: and his chief argument with his friends, who were continually &s;oliciting him to leave the univer|&s;ity, was, that he was not yet enough in|&s;tructed in religion him&s;elf to be a teacher of it to others. It was an arduous ta&s;k, he &s;aid, e&s;pecially at that time; and prote&s;tanti&s;m could not &s;uffer more, than by the rawne&s;s and inexperience of its teachers.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts continued him at Oxford till the thirty-fifth year of his age. About that time the vicarage of Norton, in the
<PB N="34" REF="36">dioce&s;e of Durham, falling vacant, his friends, who had intere&s;t to obtain it for him, re|newed their &s;olicitations, and at length pre|vailed upon him to accept it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>While I was thus bu&s;ied, I was drawn by certain friends to accept a benefice, being very unwilling there|unto.

<P>Before he went to re&s;ide, he was appoint|ed to preach before the king, who was then at Greenwich. Strype, in his annals, &s;eems to intimate, that Mr. Gilpin was at that time famous for his preaching in the north, and that it was upon this account he was called upon to preach at court. But there is little authority for this. He does not &s;eem to have been yet a preacher at all; at lea&s;t, of any note. It is rather probable, the only rea&s;on of his being &s;ent to upon this occa&s;ion, was that he might give a public te&s;timony of his being well inclined to the reformation: for the heads of the prote&s;tant party were at this
<PB N="35" REF="37">time very &s;crupulous in the di&s;po&s;al of liv|ings. <Q>It was then ordered, &s;ays Heylin, in his church-hi&s;tory, that none &s;hould be pre|&s;ented unto any benefice in the donation of the crown, till he had fir&s;t preached before the king, and thereby pa&s;&s;ed his judgment and approbation.</Q></P>
<P>The reigning vice of that age, as its hi&s;to|rians inform us, was avarice, or more pro|perly rapine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following pa&s;&s;age from one of bi&s;hop Lati|mer's court-&s;ermons will &s;hew how much things were altered in a very few years: <Q>My father, &s;ays he, was a yeoman, and had no land of his own; only he had a farm of three or four pounds by the year at the ut|mo&s;t: and hereupon he tilled &s;o much as kept half a dozen men. He had a walk for an hundred &s;heep; and my mother milked thirty kine. He was able, and did find the king an harne&s;s, with him&s;elf and his hor&s;e. I remember my&s;elf to have buckled on my father's har|ne&s;s, when he went to Blackheath-field. He kept his &s;on at &s;chool till he went to the univer&s;ity, and main|tained him there. He married his daughters with five pounds, or twenty nobles, apiece. He kept ho&s;pitality with his neighbours, and &s;ome alms he gave to the poor. And all this he did out of the &s;aid farm.&mdash;Whereas he that hath the &s;aid farm now, I am informed, pays &s;ix|teen pounds by the year, or more; and is not able to do any thing for his prince, for him&s;elf, or for his chil|dren, or give a cup of drink to the poor.</Q></P>
<P>The covetou&s;ne&s;s of the gentry appeared by oppre&s;&s;ing the poorer &s;ort by inclo&s;ures; thereby taking away the
<PB N="36" REF="38">lands, where they had u&s;ed, and their forefathers, to feed their cattle: which was &s;uch an oppre&s;&s;ion, that it cau&s;ed a rebellion in the year 1549.</P>
<P>Another way they had of oppre&s;&s;ing their inferiors, was, by means of the law. For when they whom they had wronged were forced to &s;ue them, they threatened the judges, or bribed them, that they commonly favour|ed the rich, or, delaying the cau&s;es of the poor, made their charges more than they could bear: oftentimes they went home with tears, after having waited long at court, their cau&s;es unheard. Latimer was never without poor &s;uiters, that came to him to &s;peak to the great men, that their matters might be heard; complaining to him at what great co&s;ts and charges they had laid, to their un|doing: in&s;omuch as, being at the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury's hou&s;e, where he u&s;ed often to re&s;ide, he had no time &s;o much as to look on his book, as he told the king in a &s;ermon. The&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions were partly occa&s;ioned by the king's great officers, who did u&s;e to commit the hearing and examination of cau&s;es to their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>For the judges, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, were very cor|rupt: Latimer would often in his &s;ermons complain of them, and would give them many a jirk. Once he &s;aid, <Q>If a judge &s;hould a&s;k him the way to hell, he would &s;hew him this way: fir&s;t let him be a covetous man; then let him take bribes; and, la&s;tly, pervert judgment. If there were &s;uch a judge in England now, he wi&s;hed we might have his &s;kin hanged up. It were a goodly &s;ight, the &s;ign of the judge's &s;kin; and &s;hould be Lot's wife to all judges that follow after.</Q></P>
<P>The curates were both ignorant, and &s;candalous for their ill lives. The people in many places with held their tithes from them; and the rea&s;on they gave was, becau&s;e their curates &s;ome were ignorant, and &s;ome were
<PB N="37" REF="39">idle, and took little pains and care in their cures; and many were &s;o intolerably lazy and wicked, that the pa|ri&s;hioners often brought information again&s;t them to the bi&s;hops, nay, to the council. Strype's memorials of king Edward VI.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="37"></NOTE>. At court all things were ve|nal;
<PB N="36" REF="38">employments, honours, favours of every kind. In the room of law and ju&s;tice, gro&s;s
<PB N="37" REF="39">bribery and wrong were common; in trade, grievous extortions and frauds. Every where and every way the poor were vexed. But in the country this rapacity was mo&s;t ob&s;erved, where the oppre&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed were &s;o in|tolerable, that the preceding year had &s;een great heats and murmurings among the peo|ple, and &s;ome counties even in arms.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e things the preachers mo&s;t in ear|ne&s;t &s;poke with great freedom; particularly bi&s;hop Latimer, who was the Cato of that age. Among others Mr. Gilpin thought it became him to take notice of evils &s;o much complained of: accordingly he made the avarice of the times his &s;ubject upon the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion; re&s;olving with an hone&s;t free|dom to cen&s;ure corruption, in whatever rank of men he ob&s;erved it.</P>
<P>He began, fir&s;t, with the clergy. He was &s;orry, he &s;aid, to ob&s;erve among them &s;uch a manife&s;t neglect of their function. To get benefices, not to take care of them, was their
<PB N="38" REF="40">endeavour: half of them were plurali&s;ts or non-re&s;idents; and &s;uch could never fulfil their charge. He was &s;hocked, he &s;aid to hear them quote human laws again&s;t God's word&mdash;if &s;uch laws did exi&s;t, they were the, remains of popery, and the king would do well to repeal them&mdash;while mens con&s;ciences would permit them to hold as many livings as they could get, and di&s;charge none, it was impo&s;&s;ible the go&s;pel could have any &s;ucce&s;s in England.</P>
<P>From the clergy he turned to the court; and ob&s;erving the king was ab&s;ent, he was obliged to introduce that part of his &s;ermon, which he had de&s;igned for him, by &s;aying, 'It grieved him to &s;ee tho&s;e ab&s;ent, who for example's &s;ake ought particularly to have been pre&s;ent. He had heard other preachers like|wi&s;e remark, that it was common for them to be ab&s;ent. Bu&s;ine&s;s might perhaps be their excu&s;e; but he could not believe, that &s;erv|ing God would ever hinder bu&s;ine&s;s. If he could, he &s;aid, he would make them hear in their chambers; but however he would &s;peak to their &s;eats (not doubting but what he &s;aid would be carried to them.)</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">You, &s;aid he, great prince, are appointed by God to be the governor of this land: let me then here call upon you in behalf of your people. It is in your power to redre&s;s them; and if you do not, the neglect mu&s;t be ac|counted for. Take away di&s;pen&s;ations for pluralities and non-re&s;idence, oblige every pa&s;tor to hold but one benefice, and as far as you can make every one do his duty: your grace's eye to look through your realm would do more good than a thou&s;and preachers. The land is full of idle pa&s;tors; and how can it be otherwi&s;e, when the nobility, and pa|trons of livings put in ju&s;t who will allow them to take out mo&s;t profit? It would be good if your grace would &s;end out &s;urveyors to &s;ee how benefices are be&s;towed. It is no wonder that your people are continually ri&s;ing up in rebellions, when they have no in&s;truc|tors to teach them their duty.&mdash;A reforma|tion! there is as much ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and idolatry, as ever; which, as far as I can fore&s;ee, will remain; for benefices are every where &s;o plundered and robbed by patrons, that in a little time no body will bring up their children to the church. It is amazing
<PB N="40" REF="42">to &s;ee how the univer&s;ities are dimini&s;hed within the&s;e few years&mdash;And I mu&s;t tell your grace, that all this is owing to you for taking no more notice of the&s;e things. For my part, I will do my duty; I will tell your grace what abu&s;es prevail, and pray to God that he will direct your heart to amend them.'</P>
<P>He next addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the magi|&s;trates, and gentry. 'They all, he told them, received their honours, their power, and their authority, from God, who expected they would make a proper u&s;e of &s;uch gifts; and would certainly call them to an account for the abu&s;e of them. But he &s;aw &s;o much ambitious &s;triving for them at court, that he was afraid they did not all con&s;ider them in their true light. He ob&s;erved, that the &s;pirit of avarice was got among them&mdash;that the country cried out again&s;t their extortions&mdash;and that when the poor came to &s;eek for ju&s;tice in London, the great men would not &s;ee them&mdash;their &s;er|vants mu&s;t fir&s;t be bribed. Oh! with what glad hearts and clear con&s;ciences, &s;aid he, might noblemen go to re&s;t, after having &s;pent the day in hearing the complaints of the poor,
<PB N="41" REF="43">and redre&s;&s;ing their wrongs! For want of that, they were obliged to &s;eek their right among lawyers, who quickly devoured every thing that was left them&mdash;thou&s;ands every term were obliged to go back wor&s;e than they came.</P>
<P>Let me then, &s;aid he, call upon you who are magi&s;trates, and put you in mind, that if the people are debtors to you for obedience, you are debtors to them for protection. If you deny this, they mu&s;t &s;uffer; but God will a&s;&s;uredly e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e again&s;t you.</P>
<P>And now, if we &s;earch for the root of all the&s;e evils; what is it but avarice? This it is that maketh the bad nobleman, the bad magi&s;trate, the bad pa&s;tor, and the bad lawyer.'</P>
<P>Having thus freely addre&s;&s;ed his audience, he concluded his &s;ermon with an hearty ex|hortation, 'That all would con&s;ider the&s;e things, and that &s;uch as found them&s;elves faulty, would amend their lives.'</P>
<P>Thus this pious man began his mini&s;try: &s;uch was the &s;en&s;e he had of that plainne&s;s and &s;incerity which became it: as he thought nothing his intere&s;t, but what was al&s;o his
<PB N="42" REF="44">duty; hope or fear never &s;wayed him. He con&s;idered him&s;elf in &s;ome degree chargeable with tho&s;e vices, which he knew were pre|vailing, and failed to rebuke.&mdash;A freedom of this nature the times however allowed: for how little &s;oever there might be of the reality of virtue, there was certainly much of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of it: public deference at lea&s;t was paid to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin's plainne&s;s therefore was very well taken, and recommended him to the no|tice of many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank; par|ticularly to Sir Francis Ru&s;&s;el, and Sir Ro|bert Dudley, afterwards earls of Bedford and Leice&s;ter, who from that time profe&s;&s;ed a great regard for him; and, when in power, were always ready to patronize him.</P>
<P>The&s;e two noblemen were both great pa|trons of virtue and letters; but with very dif|ferent views, as they were indeed very dif|ferent men.</P>
<P>Bedford appeared at court with all the ad|vantages of birth. His father, the fir&s;t earl of that name, was one of the greate&s;t men of his age, eminent for un&s;potted hone&s;ty, and &s;uperior talents in war and peace. His &s;on
<PB N="43" REF="45">pur&s;ued his &s;teps, and though he wanted his father's great abilities, he was however a very wi&s;e and hone&s;t man, and acted afterwards a con&s;iderable part in &s;ettling the reformation under Elizabeth; to who&s;e court he was a very great ornament. He was a friend to merit from the real love he bore to virtue.</P>
<P>Leice&s;ter, however accompli&s;hed in many re&s;pects, was one of the greate&s;t villains of his time; copying the examples of his father and grandfather <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His grandfather was Edmund Dudley, the infamous mini&s;ter of Henry the &s;eventh's avarice; who, with Emp|&s;on his a&s;&s;ociate, hara&s;&s;ed the people for many years with all &s;orts of oppre&s;&s;ion. He was executed in the begin|ning of Henry the eighth.</P>
<P>His father was created duke of Northumberland by Edward the &s;ixth, and was a &s;ignal in&s;tance of lawle&s;s ambition, and the ruinous con&s;equences that often attend it. Having &s;acrificed the good protector to his jealou&s;y, procured the &s;ettlement of the crown in his own family, and contrived, as many authors write, the king's death; he &s;aw in a moment all his de&s;igns cru&s;hed, him&s;elf and his adherents ruined, even by the&s;e very contrivances. He was executed in the fir&s;t of queen Mary.</P></NOTE>. He was thoroughly prac|ti&s;ed in every &s;pecies of di&s;hone&s;ty; yet &s;uch a ma&s;ter of di&s;&s;imulation, that he could act even the wor&s;t part plau&s;ibly. He courted good men for the credit of their acquain|tance.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">Such were Mr. Gilpin's chief patrons&mdash;voluntary patrons, whom no application on his part engaged. He received their offered friend&s;hip with humility and gratitude, never intending to put it to a trial. This backward|ne&s;s proceeded not from any &s;ullen notion of independence, but from an utter aver&s;ion to all &s;olicitation for church preferment. The lord Bedford's intere&s;t indeed he &s;crupled not to &s;olicit occa&s;ionally for his friends: but he never once a&s;ked, that I can find, though much courted to it, any favour of the earl of Leice&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin is &s;aid likewi&s;e at this time to have been taken notice of by &s;ecretary Cecil, afterwards lord Burleigh, who obtained for him a general licence for preaching. In granting the&s;e licences great caution was then u&s;ed: none but men of approved worth could apply for them with &s;ucce&s;s. Upon looking over king Edward's grants, it does not appear there were more than two or three and twenty thus licenced during that king's reign. Among the&s;e were the bi&s;hops Jewel, Grindal, and Coverdale.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47">While Mr. Gilpin was at London, he fre|quently vi&s;ited Cuthbert Tun&s;tal bi&s;hop of Durham, who was his uncle, and had always expre&s;&s;ed a great regard for him. It is pro|bable indeed, his parents intended him a churchman, with a view to his being advan|ced by this prelate. But the bi&s;hop was at this time in no capacity to &s;erve him: he was di&s;graced, and in the tower.</P>
<P>During the reign of Henry the eighth, Tun&s;tal had lived in great credit at court; was e&s;teemed a man of abilities, a good &s;cho|lar, and an able &s;tate&s;man. His &s;overeign knew his worth, advanced him to the &s;ee of Durham, employed him much at home and abroad, and at his death left him, during the minority, one of the regents of the kingdom. But in the &s;ucceeding reign his intere&s;t le&s;&s;en|ed. He was not altogether &s;atisfied with the changes daily made in religion; and though he was enough inclined to give up &s;ome of the gro&s;&s;er tenets of popery, yet in general he favoured it, and was always in great e&s;teem with the Romi&s;h party. This occa&s;ioned their making him privy to &s;ome trea&s;onable de&s;igns; which, in his cautious way, he neither con|curred
<PB N="46" REF="48">in, nor betrayed. The plot mi&s;carried: the bi&s;hop was indeed &s;u&s;pected, but nothing appeared. Some time afterwards, when the duke of Somer&s;et's papers were &s;eized, an un|lucky letter was found, which fully detected him. He was called immediately before the council, tried by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, found guilty, deprived, and committed.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin, having now &s;tayed as long in London as his bu&s;ine&s;s required, repaired to his pari&s;h; and immediately entered upon the dudes of it. He failed not, as occa&s;ion re|quired, to u&s;e the king's licence in other parts of the country; but his own pari&s;h he con|&s;idered as the place where his chief care was due. Here he made it his principal endea|vour to inculcate moral virtue; and to di&s;|&s;uade from tho&s;e vices, which he ob&s;erved mo&s;t prevalent. He &s;eldom handled contro|verted points; being afraid, le&s;t, endeavour|ing to in&s;truct, he might only mi&s;lead. For, however re&s;olved he was again&s;t popery, he yet &s;aw not the prote&s;tant cau&s;e in its full &s;trength; and was &s;till &s;carcely &s;ettled in &s;ome of his religious opinions. Hence by degrees a diffidence of him&s;elf aro&s;e, which gave him
<PB N="47" REF="49">great unea&s;ine&s;s. He thought, he had en|gaged too &s;oon in his office&mdash;that he could not &s;ufficiently di&s;charge it&mdash;that he &s;hould not re&s;t in giving his hearers only moral in|&s;tructions&mdash;that, over&s;pread as the country was with popi&s;h doctrines, he did ill to pretend to be a teacher of religion, if he were unable to oppo&s;e &s;uch errors.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts made every day a greater impre&s;&s;ion upon him. At length, quite un|happy, he wrote bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal an account of his &s;ituation. The bi&s;hop, who was the farthe&s;t of any man from a bigot, and liked him not the wor&s;e for his freedom of inquiry, told him, As he was &s;o unea&s;y, it was his advice, he &s;hould think of nothing till he had fixed his religion: and that, in his opinion, he could not do better than put his pari&s;h into the hands of &s;ome per&s;on, in whom he could confide, and &s;pend a year or two in Germany, France, and Holland; by which means he might have an opportunity of con|ver&s;ing with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent pro|fe&s;&s;ors on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. He ac|quainted him likewi&s;e, that his going abroad at this time would do him al&s;o a con&s;iderable
<PB N="48" REF="50">&s;ervice: for, during his confinement, he had written two or three books, particularly one upon the lord's &s;upper, which he had a de|&s;ire to publi&s;h; and as this could not be done &s;o conveniently at home, he would be glad to have it done under his in&s;pection at Paris.</P>
<P>This letter gave Mr. Gilpin much &s;atis|faction: it ju&s;t propo&s;ed his own wi&s;h. A conference with &s;ome of the learned men abroad was what his heart had long been &s;et on. Only he had one objection to the &s;cheme; he was afraid it might prove too expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>As to that, the bi&s;hop wrote, his living would do &s;omething towards his mainte|nance; and deficiences he would &s;upply.</P>
<P>But this did not remove the difficulty. Mr. Gilpin's notions of the pa&s;toral care were &s;o &s;trict, that he thought no excu&s;e could ju&s;tify non-re&s;idence for &s;o con&s;iderable a time as he intended to be abroad. He could not there|fore think of &s;upporting him&s;elf with any part of the income of his living. However, abroad he was determined to go; and re&s;olv|ed,
<PB N="49" REF="51">if he &s;taid the &s;horter time, to rely only upon his own frugal management of the little money he had; and to leave the re&s;t to the bi&s;hop's genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Having re&s;igned his living therefore in fa|vour of a per&s;on, with who&s;e abilities, and inclinations to di&s;charge the duties of it, he was well acquainted, he &s;et out for London, to receive his la&s;t orders from the bi&s;hop, and to embark.</P>
<P>The account of his re&s;ignation got to town before him; and gave the bi&s;hop, anxious for his nephew's thriving in the world, great con|cern. 'Here are your friends, &s;ays he, en|deavouring to provide for you; and you are taking every method to fru&s;trate their en|deavours. But be warned: by the&s;e cour&s;es, depend upon it, you will bring your&s;elf pre|&s;ently to a mor&s;el of bread.' Mr. Gilpin begged the bi&s;hop would attribute what he had done to a &s;crupulous con&s;cience, which really would not permit him to act otherwi&s;e. 'Con&s;cience! replied the bi&s;hop; why you might have had a di&s;pen&s;ation.' 'Will any di&s;pen&s;ation, an&s;wered Mr. Gilpin, re&s;train
<PB N="50" REF="52">the tempter from endeavouring, in my ab|&s;ence, to corrupt the people committed to my care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Bi&s;hop Latimer, &s;peaking of a clergyman of tho&s;e times, who was made controller of the mint, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf much in the &s;ame manner. 'Is this a meet office, &s;ays he, for a prie&s;t, who has cure of &s;ouls? I would a&s;k one que&s;tion: I would fain know, who con|trols the devil at home in his pari&s;h, while he controls the mint? If the apo&s;tle might not leave his office of preaching to be a deacon, &s;hall one leave it for mint|ing? I cannot tell you: but the &s;aying is, that &s;ince prie&s;ts have been minters, money hath been wor&s;e.'</P></NOTE>? Alas! I fear it would be but an ill excu&s;e for the harm done my flock, if I &s;hould &s;ay, when God &s;hall call me to an ac|count for my &s;teward&s;hip, that I was ab&s;ent by di&s;pen&s;ation.' This reply put the bi&s;hop a little out of humour; but his di&s;gu&s;t was &s;oon over, and this in&s;tance of Mr. Gilpin's &s;incerity rai&s;ed him &s;till higher in his uncle's e&s;teem. The bi&s;hop would frequently how|ever chide him, as Mr. Gilpin afterwards would tell his friends, for the&s;e qualms of con&s;cience; and would be often remind|ing him, that, if he did not look better to his intere&s;t, he would certainly die a beggar.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">The bi&s;hop, putting into his hands the books he had written, gave him his la&s;t in|&s;tructions, and parted with him in very good humour. So he took the fir&s;t opportunity of embarking for Holland.</P>

<P>UPON his landing, he went immedi|ately to Mechlin, to vi&s;it his brother George, who was at that time pur&s;uing his &s;tudies there.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it was probably upon a religious account; for George, tho' a man of virtue and learning, &s;eems to have been a zealous papi&s;t. What influence his brother Bernard had over him does not appear. We meet with him however &s;oon afterwards a warm advocate for the reformation; to forward which, he tran&s;lated, from the Dutch into Engli&s;h, a very keen &s;atyr again&s;t popery, en|titled, The beehive of the Roman church. Upon Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion, he applied him|&s;elf to &s;tate affairs; for which indeed he was now preparing him&s;elf at Mechlin, where the civil law was much &s;tudied. The earl of Bedford brought him to court; where he was &s;oon taken notice of by the queen; to whom he &s;o well recommended him&s;elf by his dexterity in bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;he made great u&s;e of him in her negotiations with the &s;tates
<PB N="53" REF="55">of Holland, and kept him many years with a public character in that country, where he was in great e&s;teem for his abilities and integ|rity. We meet with his name &s;ometimes in the accounts of tho&s;e tran&s;actions. Motley particularly, &s;peaking of &s;ame affairs then in agitation, makes honourable mention of him. <Q>The hans-towns, &s;ays he, procured, in an imperial edict, that the Engli&s;h merchants a&s;&s;ociated in Embden and other places, &s;hould be adjudged monopoli&s;ts; which was done by Suderman, a great civilian. There was there at that time for the queen as nimble a man as Suderman, and he had the chancellor of Embden to &s;econd him; yet they could not &s;top the edict. But Gilpin played his cards &s;o well, that he prevailed, the imperial ban &s;hould not be publi&s;hed till after the diet; and that in the mean time his imperial maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;end an emba&s;&s;ador to England, to adverti&s;e the queen of the edict.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin having &s;taid a few weeks with his brother at Mechlin, went afterwards to Louvain, where he re&s;olved to &s;ettle for &s;ome time. He made frequent excur&s;ions to Ant|werp,
<PB N="54" REF="56">Ghent, Bru&s;&s;els, and other places in the Low Countries; where he would &s;pend a few weeks among tho&s;e of any reputation, whether papi&s;ts or prote&s;tants: but he made Louvain his place of re&s;idence, for which city he always expre&s;&s;ed a more than com|mon affection. And indeed it was a mo&s;t agreeable and commodious retreat for a &s;cho|lar; enjoying all the advantages of &s;ituation, and affording the be&s;t opportunities for &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Louvain is one of the chief towns in Bra|bant. It had formerly been the center of a very con&s;iderable woollen trade. More than four thou&s;and looms were daily at work in it, each of which employed near forty people. But its trade declining, it grew more beauti|ful, as it became le&s;s populous. Elegant hou&s;es were built, and &s;pacious walks laid oat within the walls of the town; the river Dyle, which flowed through the mid&s;t of it, affording the inhabitants many opportunities of &s;hewing their ta&s;te. Upon an eminence at one end &s;tands the ca&s;tle, a venerable old building, ri&s;ing out of the mid&s;t of a vine|yard. Its battlements are much frequented
<PB N="55" REF="57">for the &s;ake of the noble pro&s;pect they com|mand over a country the mo&s;t agreeably di|ver&s;ified with every thing that can make an exten&s;ive land&s;kip beautiful; here a &s;tately palace, there a lonely mona&s;try, rivers, lawns, woods, till the eye is lo&s;t in a boundle&s;s plain blending it&s;elf with the horrizon. The ele|gance of this &s;ituation made Louvain the &s;eat of politene&s;s. Hither the men of ta&s;te and lei&s;ure from all parts repaired; where in&s;tead of the noi&s;e and hurry of trade, &s;o common in the towns of Flanders, they enjoyed a calm retreat, and the agreeable interchange of &s;oli|tude and company. But what endeared Lou|vain mo&s;t to a &s;cholar, was the noble &s;eminary there e&s;tabli&s;hed. John the fourth duke of Brabant, with a view to keep up the credit of one of his chief towns upon the decay of the woollen manufacture, politically founded a univer&s;ity in it; which &s;oon became one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Europe. It con&s;i&s;ts of many colleges, in each of which philo&s;o|phy was taught by two profe&s;&s;ors, who read two hours each morning. The &s;cholars had the re&s;t of the day to commit to writing what they heard.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">At the time Mr. Gilpin was at Louvain, it was one of the chief places for &s;tudents in divinity. Some of the mo&s;t eminent divines on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion re&s;ided there; and the mo&s;t important topics of religion were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great freedom.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin's fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s here was to get him&s;elf introduced to tho&s;e of any reputation for learning; to whom his own addre&s;s and attainments were no mean recommendation, and &s;upplied the place of a long acquaintance, He was pre&s;ent at all public readings and di&s;|putations: he committed every thing mate|rial to writing: all his opinions he re-ex|amined; propo&s;ed his doubts in private to his friends; and in every re&s;pect made the be&s;t u&s;e of his time.</P>
<P>He now began to have ju&s;ter notions of the doctrine of the reformed: he &s;aw things in a clearer and a &s;tronger light; and felt a &s;atisfaction in the change he had made, to which he had hitherto been a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>While he was thus pur&s;uing his &s;tudies, he and all the prote&s;tants in tho&s;e parts were &s;uddenly alarmed with melancholy news from England&mdash;king Edward's death&mdash;the lady
<PB N="57" REF="59">Jane's fall&mdash;and queen Mary's acce&s;&s;ion, who&s;e bigotry was well known, and in whom the &s;igns of a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit al|ready appeared.</P>
<P>This bad news came however attended with one agreeable circum&s;tance; an account of bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal's relea&s;e from the tower, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in his bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards Mr. Gilpin received a let|ter from his brother George, intreating him to come immediately to Mechlin; for he had an affair of con&s;equence to communicate to him, which ab&s;olutely required an interview. When he came thither, he found his brother had received a letter from the bi&s;hop, in|forming him, that he had found a benefice of con&s;iderable value vacant in his dioce&s;e, which he wi&s;hed he could per&s;uade his bro|ther Bernard to accept; imagining he might by this time have got over his former &s;cruples.</P>
<P>George knew he had a difficult province to manage; but determined however to try his influence. He begged his brother there|fore to con&s;ider, 'That he could not &s;tay &s;o long abroad for want of money, as he might
<PB N="58" REF="60">probably chu&s;e&mdash;that he had already offend|ed the bi&s;hop&mdash;and that a &s;econd refu&s;al might occa&s;ion an intire breach with him&mdash;that if it did not, yet the bi&s;hop was now an old man&mdash;&s;uch benefices were not every day to be had&mdash;and after the bi&s;hop's death, he was not likely to meet with a friend, who would thus pre&s;s him to accept a living.' But nothing would do: Bernard continued unmoved, and gave one an&s;wer to all his brother's arguments, 'That his con&s;cience would not &s;uffer him to comply.' George an&s;wered, 'He might have his living as well taken care of, as if him&s;elf were there: be|&s;ides, &s;ays he, you have a bi&s;hop approving and advi&s;ing the &s;tep I recommend; what would you de&s;ire more?' If a bi&s;hop's judgment, &s;aid Bernard, was to be the rule of my actions, I &s;hould comply; but as I am to &s;tand or fall by my own, the ca&s;e is different.' In &s;hort, George was obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and Bernard returned to Lonvain, heartily vexed that he had lo&s;t &s;o much time upon &s;o trifling an occa&s;ion. He thought it however his duty to give the bi&s;hop his rea|&s;ons
<PB N="59" REF="61">for not accepting his kind offer, which he did in the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Right honourable, and my &s;ingular good ma&s;ter, my duty remembered in mo&s;t humble manner, plea&s;eth it your honour to be informed, that of late my brother wrote to me, that in any wi&s;e I mu&s;t meet him at Mechlin; for he mu&s;t debate with me urgent affairs, &s;uch as could not be di&s;|patched by writing. When we met, I perceived it was nothing el&s;e but to &s;ee if he could per&s;uade me to take a benefice, and to continue in &s;tudy at the univer&s;ity: which if I had known to be the cau&s;e of his &s;ending for me, I &s;hould not have needed to interrupt my &s;tudy to meet him; for I have &s;o long debated that matter with learned men, e&s;pecially with the holy pro|phets, and mo&s;t antient and godly writers &s;ince Chri&s;t's time, that I tru&s;t, &s;o long as I have to live, never to burden my con|&s;cience with having a benefice, and lying from it. My brother &s;aid, that your lord|&s;hip had written to him, that you would gladly be&s;tow one on me; and that your
<PB N="60" REF="62">lord&s;hip thought (and &s;o did other of my friends, of which he was one) that I was much too &s;crupulous in that point. Where|unto I always &s;ay, if I be too &s;crupulous (as I cannot think that I am) the matter is &s;uch, that I had rather my con&s;cience were therein a great deal too &s;trait, than a little too large: for I am &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;uaded, that I &s;hall never offend God by refu&s;ing to have a benefice, and lie from it, &s;o long as I judge not evil of others; which I tru&s;t I &s;hall not, but rather pray God daily, that all who have cures may di&s;charge their of|fice in his &s;ight, as may tend mo&s;t to his glory, and the profit of his church. He replied again&s;t me, that your lord&s;hip would give me no benefice, but what you would &s;ee di&s;charged in my ab&s;ence as well or better than I could di&s;charge it my&s;elf. Whereunto I an&s;wered, that I would be &s;orry, if I thought not there were many thou&s;ands in England more able to di&s;|charge a cure than I find my&s;elf; and therefore I de&s;ire, they may both take the cure and the profit al&s;o, that they may be able to feed the body and the &s;oul both,
<PB N="61" REF="63">as I think all pa&s;tors are bounden. As for me, I can never per&s;uade my&s;elf to take the profit, and let another take the pains: for if he &s;hould teach and preach as faith|fully as ever St. Au&s;tin did, yet &s;hould I not think my&s;elf di&s;charged. And if I &s;hould &s;train my con&s;cience herein, and &s;trive with it to remain here, or in any other univer&s;ity, with &s;uch a condition, the unquietne&s;s of my con&s;cience would not &s;uffer me to profit in &s;tudy at all.</P>
<P>I am here, at this pre&s;ent, I thank God, very well placed for &s;tudy among a com|pany of learned men, joining to the friers minors; having free acce&s;s at all times to a notable library among the friers, men both well learned and &s;tudious. I have entered acquaintance with divers of the be&s;t learned in the town; and for my part was never more de&s;irous to learn in all my life than at this pre&s;ent. Wherefore I am bold, knowing your lord&s;hip's &s;ingular good-will towards me, to open my mind thus rudely and plainly unto your goodne&s;s, mo&s;t hum|bly be&s;eeching you to &s;uffer me to live without charge, that I may &s;tudy quietly.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">And whereas I know well your lord&s;hip is careful how I &s;hould live, if God &s;hould call your lord&s;hip, being now aged, I de|&s;ire you let not that care trouble you: for, if I had no other &s;hift, I could get a lec|ture&s;hip, I know, &s;hortly, either in this univer&s;ity, or at lea&s;t in &s;ome abbey hereby; where I &s;hould not lo&s;e my time: and this kind of life, if God be plea&s;ed, I de&s;ire be|fore any benefice. And thus I pray Chri&s;t always to have your lord&s;hip in his ble&s;&s;ed keeping. By your lord&s;hip's humble &s;cho|lar and chaplain.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The bi&s;hop was not offended at this letter. The unaffected piety of it di&s;armed all re|&s;entment; and led him rather to admire a behaviour, in which the motives of con&s;cience &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;o &s;uperior to tho&s;e of in|tere&s;t. <Q>Which of our modern gaping rooks, exclaims the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, could endeavour with more indu&s;try to ob|tain a benefice, than this man did to avoid one!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">Mr. Gilpin, having got over this trouble|&s;ome affair (for &s;olicitations of this kind gave him of all things the mo&s;t trouble) continued &s;ome time longer at Louvain, daily improv|ing in religious knowledge. His own opi|nions he kept to him&s;elf, indu&s;triou&s;ly endea|vouring to make him&s;elf acquainted with the opinions of others, and the arguments upon which they were grounded.</P>
<P>While he &s;tayed in the Low Countries, he was greatly affected with the melancholy &s;ight of crouds of his dejected countrymen arriv|ing daily in tho&s;e parts from the bloody &s;cene then acting in England. The&s;e unhappy exiles however &s;oon recovered their &s;pirits, and, di&s;|per&s;ing into various towns, chearfully applied them&s;elves, each as his profe&s;&s;ion led, to gain an hone&s;t livelihood. The meaner fort exer|ci&s;ed their crafts; the learned taught &s;chools, read lectures, and corrected pre&s;&s;es; at Ba&s;il particularly, where the ingenious Operinus was then carrying printing to great perfec|tion. Their commendable endeavours to make them&s;elves not quite a burden to tho&s;e who entertained them were &s;uitably reward|ed. The &s;everal towns of Germany and
<PB N="64" REF="66">Holland, finding their advantage in the&s;e &s;trangers, &s;hewed them all imaginable ci|vility: many private per&s;ons likewi&s;e con|tributed to their aid: but, above all others, the generous duke of Wirtemburgh di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in their favour; who&s;e boun|ty to the Engli&s;h at Stra&s;burgh and Franck|fort &s;hould never pa&s;s unremembered, where the&s;e things are mentioned. Nor was Mr. Gilpin a little plea&s;ed to find, that, however unable he was per&s;onally to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, his large acquaintance in the country furni&s;hed him with the means of being u&s;eful to many of them by very &s;erviceable recommenda|tions.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin had been now two years in Flanders; and had made him&s;elf perfect ma&s;ter of the controver&s;y, as it was there handled. He left Louvain therefore, and took a journey to Paris.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through a fore&s;t in his way thither, he was attacked by highwaymen; from whom, being very well mounted, he e&s;caped to a cottage by the road-&s;ide. The rogues pur&s;ued him to the hou&s;e, and declared they would pull it down, or &s;et it on fire, if he
<PB N="65" REF="67">did not immediately come out. The family was in great con&s;termation: in vain did Mr. Gilpin repre&s;ent, that the&s;e were only idle threatenings&mdash;that on &s;o public a road they dur&s;t not meddle with the hou&s;e&mdash;and that they would pre&s;ently be gone. All availed nothing. To quiet therefore the di&s;turbance he had occa&s;ioned, he went out, and gave the rogues his money.</P>
<P>When he got to Paris, the fir&s;t thing he &s;et about was printing the bi&s;hop of Dur|ham's book. This prelate, as hath been ob|&s;erved, was a very moderate man; no favourer of prote&s;tanti&s;m, yet no friend to &s;ome of the gro&s;&s;er tenets of the Romi&s;h church; parti|cularly to its extravagant doctrine of the &s;a|crament of the lord's &s;upper: and this book, which &s;hewed the moderation of its author, gave much offence to all the more zealous papi&s;ts; and drew many &s;evere reproaches upon Mr. Gilpin, who was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have corrupted the bi&s;hop's work. Of what was &s;aid his friends gave him notice, particularly Francis Wickliff; who de&s;ired, if the charge was unju&s;t, that he would purge him&s;elf of it. Mr. Gilpin told him, that
<PB N="66" REF="68">was ea&s;ily done; and opening a de&s;k, 'See here, &s;ays he, a letter from my lord of Dur|ham him&s;elf, in which he thanks me for my care and fidelity in this bu&s;ine&s;s.'</P>
<P>While Mr. Gilpin &s;taid at Paris, he lodged with Va&s;co&s;an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An eminent printer.</NOTE>, to whom he had been re|commended by his friends in the Netherlands. This learned man &s;hewed him great regard, did him many friendly offices, and introduced him to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in that city.</P>
<P>Here popery became quite his aver&s;ion: he &s;aw more of its &s;uper&s;tition and craft than he had yet &s;een; the former among the people, the latter among the prie&s;ts, who &s;crupled not to avow, how little truth was their concern. He would frequently a&s;k, 'Whether &s;uch and &s;uch bad con&s;equences might not ari&s;e from &s;uch and &s;uch doctrines?' But he was always an&s;wered, 'That was not to be re|garded&mdash;the church could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them&mdash;and little inconveniences mu&s;t be bore with.'</P>
<P>At Paris he found his old acquaintance Mr. Neal, of New-college; who always favour|ed
<PB N="67" REF="69">popery, and was now become a bigot to it. Mr. Gilpin often expre&s;&s;ed to him the concern he had upon this account; and ap|proved his friend&s;hip, by the earne&s;t de&s;ire he &s;hewed to make him &s;ee his errors: but Neal was not of a temper to be wrought upon.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of popi&s;h &s;ophi&s;try and pre|judice, Mr. Gilpin would &s;ometimes relate a conver&s;ation about image-wor&s;hip, which he once had with this Neal at Paris. He was ob&s;erving to him the great ab&s;urdity of the Romani&s;ts, in condemning idolatry, and yet countenancing &s;uch an u&s;e of images, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily draw the people into it. For his part, he &s;aid, he knew not how a chri&s;|tain could allow him&s;elf in kneeling to an image; and a&s;ked Neal, whether, in his con|&s;cience, he did not think it the idolatry for|bidden in the &s;econd commandment? Neal was for di&s;tingui&s;hing between an idol and an image: the images of &s;aints, he &s;aid, were not idols; and therefore the reverence paid to them could not be idolatry. Mr. Gilpin ob&s;erved, that in the &s;econd commandment there was no mention made of an idol: the
<PB N="68" REF="70">prohibition was, 'Bow not down to the like|ne&s;s of any created thing.' And what is it, &s;aid he, that makes an idol? The work|man makes the re&s;emblance of a human creature: the image thus made is no idol: it is wor&s;hip that makes it one. Hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 'an idol is nothing.'&mdash;a mere creature of the imagination. The di&s;tinc|tion therefore between Latria and Doulia is to no purpo&s;e: it is made void by the ex|pre&s;s words, <Q>Thou &s;halt not bow down unto them.</Q> The very po&s;ture of adora|tion, he ob&s;erved, was forbidden; and that at lea&s;t the Romani&s;ts every where practi&s;ed.&mdash;To all this Neal had only one general an|&s;wer: 'You may &s;ay ju&s;t what you plea&s;e; but the&s;e things are e&s;tabli&s;hed by the church, and cannot be altered.'</P>
<P>This was the &s;ame Neal, who was after|wards chaplain to bi&s;hop Bonner, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by being &s;ole voucher of the very improbable and &s;illy &s;tory of the nag's|head con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin having &s;pent three years abroad, was now fully &s;atisfied in all his more con|&s;iderable
<PB N="69" REF="71">&s;cruples. He wanted no farther conviction of the bad tendency of popery: he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome reformation; and began to think every day more favour|ably of the pre&s;ent one. The doctrine of the corporal pre&s;ence indeed he had not yet fully con&s;idered; but he looked upon it as a my&s;tery, which it rather became him to acquie&s;ce in than examine. The principal end of his going abroad being thus an&s;wered, he was de&s;irous of returning home.</P>
<P>The Marian per&s;ecution was &s;till raging. His friends therefore, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, di&s;&s;uaded him from his de&s;ign. They re|pre&s;ented the danger he would be in at this juncture in England&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed him to wait for happier times&mdash;and &s;ugge&s;ted, that it was little le&s;s than madne&s;s to think of going to a place, from whence all, of his &s;entiments, were endeavouring to withdraw them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Bat it is mo&s;t probable, that his purpo&s;e to return at this time was in pur&s;uance of the bi&s;hop of Durham's advice; who, find|ing the infirmities of age increa&s;e upon him, and believing his nephew totally unqualified
<PB N="70" REF="72">to advance him&s;elf in life, might be de&s;irous of providing for him before his death; and hoped that his power, in that remote part of the kingdom, would be a &s;ufficient protec|tion for him again&s;t his enemies. It is how|ever certain, that he came into England dur|ing the heat of the per&s;ecution.</P>

<PB N="71" REF="73">
<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>UPON his arrival in England, he went immediately to the bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, who was then in his dioce&s;e. Here this humane prelate kept him&s;elf withdrawn during mo&s;t of that violent reign, to avoid having any hand in mea&s;ures which he ab|horred.</P>
<P>When he left London, upon his relea&s;e from the tower, he was &s;traitly charged with the entire extirpation of here&s;y in his dioce&s;e; and was given to under&s;tand, that &s;everity would be the only allowed te&s;t of his zeal. The&s;e in&s;tructions he received in the &s;pirit they were given; loudly threatening, that heretics &s;hould no where find a warmer re|ception than at Durham: and it was thought indeed the prote&s;tants would hardly meet with much favour from him, as they had &s;hewn him &s;o little. But nothing was fur|ther from his intention than per&s;ecution; in|&s;omuch that his was almo&s;t the only dioce&s;e, where the poor prote&s;tants enjoyed any re|po&s;e. When mo&s;t of the other bi&s;hops &s;ent
<PB N="72" REF="74">in large accounts of their &s;ervices to religion, very lame ones came from Durham: they were filled with high encomiums of the or|thodoxy of the dioce&s;e, inter&s;per&s;ed here and there with the trial of an heretic; but either the depo&s;itions again&s;t him were not &s;uffi|ciently proved, or there were great hopes of his recantation&mdash;no mention however was made of any burnings. The following &s;tory of his lenity we have from Mr. Fox. A per|&s;on had been accu&s;ed to him of here&s;y, whom he had &s;lightly examined, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. His chancellor thinking him too favourable, pre&s;&s;|ed for a further examination: the bi&s;hop an|&s;wered, 'We have hitherto lived peaceably among our neighbours: let us continue &s;o, and not bring this man's blood upon us.' A behaviour of this kind was but ill reli&s;hed by the zealous council; and the bi&s;hop laid de|&s;ervedly under the calumny of being not ac|tuated by true Romi&s;h principles.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of the dioce&s;e of Dur|ham, when Mr. Gilpin came there. The bi&s;hop received him with great friendship; and within a very little time, gave him the archdeaconry of Durham; to which the rec|tory
<PB N="73" REF="75">of Ea&s;ington was annexed. It is pro|bable, that if Mr. Gilpin came home by the bi&s;hop's advice, this preferment was then va|cant, or &s;oon expected to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Upon removing to his pari&s;h, he found it in great di&s;order. With a firm re&s;olution therefore of doing what good he could in it, he &s;et him&s;elf in earne&s;t to reprove vice pub|licly and privately; to encourage virtue; and to explain the nature of true religion, with a freedom by no means &s;uited to tho&s;e danger|ous times.</P>
<P>Very material objections were then made to the clergy of tho&s;e parts. The reforma|tion, which advanced but &s;lowly in England, had made lea&s;t progre&s;s in the north. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics there wanted not a popi&s;h reign to authorize their &s;uper&s;tition. But this was their be&s;t &s;ide. Their manners were &s;canda|lous: the pa&s;toral care was totally neglected; and it is hard to &s;ay, whether vice or igno|rance was more remarkable in them.</P>
<P>All over England indeed the church was very ill &s;upplied with mini&s;ters. <Q>As for the inferior clergy, &s;ays Fuller, the be&s;t that could be gotten, were placed in pa&s;toral
<PB N="74" REF="76">charges; Alas! tolerability was eminency in that age. A ru&s;h candle &s;eemed a torch where no brighter light was ever &s;een be|fore. Surely preaching now ran very low, if it be true what I read, that Mr. Taver|nour, of Water-Eaton in Oxford&s;hire, high-&s;heriff of the county, came in pure charity, not o&s;tentation, and gave the &s;cholars a &s;er|mon in St. Mary's, with his gold chain about his neck, and his &s;word by his &s;ide <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nor can we imagine, that the high-&s;heriff him&s;elf contributed much to advance the art of preaching, if we may judge of his oratory by a &s;pecimen of it &s;till pre|&s;erved. <Q>Arriving, &s;ays he, at the mount of St. Mary in the &s;tony &s;tage where I now &s;tand, I have brought you &s;ome fine bi&s;kets baked in the oven of charity, and carefully con&s;erved for the chickens of the church, the &s;parrows of the &s;pirit, and the &s;weet &s;wallows of &s;al|vation.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>We may judge likewi&s;e of the &s;tate of learning at that time among the clergy, from the accounts &s;till pre&s;erved of &s;ome archidia|conal vi&s;itations. 'Latin&egrave; verba aliquot intel|ligit, non &s;ententiam; Latin&egrave; utcunque in|telligit; Latin&egrave; pauca intelligit;' were the expre&s;&s;ions generally made u&s;e of to charac|terize them in this particular.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">How much, in the north e&s;pecially, the pa&s;toral care was neglected, we may judge from an account given us of the clergy of tho&s;e parts, by a bi&s;hop of Durham, in a letter &s;till pre&s;erved, to an archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury.</P>
<P><Q>It is lamentable, &s;ays he, to &s;ee how negli|gently they &s;ay any &s;ervice, and how &s;eldom. Your cures are all, except Rachdale, as far out of order as any of the country. Whalley hath as ill a vicar as the wor&s;t. The bi&s;hop of Man liveth here at ea&s;e, and as merry as pope Joan. The bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter hath compounded with my lord of York for his vi&s;itation, and gathereth up the money by his &s;ervants: but never a word &s;poken of any vi&s;itation or reformation; and that, he &s;aith, he doth out of friend&s;hip, be|cau&s;e he will not trouble the country, nor put them to charge in calling them together <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Bi&s;hop Latimer relates a &s;tory of a bi&s;hop of this kind, which is worth tran&s;cribing. <Q>I heard of a bi&s;hop, &s;ays he, that went on a vi&s;itation; and (as it was the cu&s;tom) when the bi&s;hop &s;hould be rung into the town, the great bell's clapper was fallen down, &s;o that he could not be rung in. There was a mighty matter made of this, and the chief of the pari&s;h were much
<PB N="76" REF="78">blamed for it at the vi&s;itation; and the bi&s;hop was &s;omewhat quick with them, and &s;ignified that he was much offended. They excu&s;ed them&s;elves as well as they could: but one among them, wi&s;er than the re&s;t, comes up to the bi&s;hop: "Why, my lord, &s;aith he, doth your lord&s;hip make &s;o great a matter of the bell that lacketh a clapper? Here is a bell, &s;aith he, (and pointed to the pulpit) which hath lacked a clapper the&s;e twenty years."&mdash;I warrant you this bi&s;hop was an un|preaching prelate. He could find fault with the bell that wanted a clapper to ring him into the town; but he could not find any fault with the par&s;on that preach|ed not at his benefice.</Q> Bi&s;hop Latimer's &s;ixth &s;ermon before the king.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="77"></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">This corruption among his brethren gave Mr. Gilpin great concern. <Q>The in&s;atiable covetou&s;ne&s;s (to u&s;e his own words) joined with the pride, carnal liberty, and other vices, which reign at this time in all e&s;tates, but e&s;pecially among us prie&s;ts, who ought to be the &s;alt of the earth, breaks me many a &s;leep.</Q> He determined therefore to do all in his power to effect a reformation; or, if that were impo&s;&s;ible, to prote&s;t however again&s;t: what he could not alter. He con&s;idered, that one of his offices obliged him to take the &s;ame care of the manners of the clergy, as the other did of tho&s;e of the laity; and as he never received an office without a de|&s;ign
<PB N="77" REF="79">of doing his duty in it, he re&s;olved to behave as an archdeacon ought.</P>
<P>Accordingly he took every opportunity of reproving the enormities he remarked. The more ingenuous of the inferior clergy he en|deavoured to bring by gentler methods to their duty: the ob&s;tinate he would rebuke with all authority. And as he feared none in the cau&s;e of religion, no man's family or fortune could exempt him from his notice. At vi&s;itations particularly, and where ever his audience was chiefly clerical, he would ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf again&s;t every thing he ob&s;erved ami&s;s, with a zeal, which might have been thought affected in one of a le&s;s approved &s;incerity.</P>
<P>It was an opinion of his, that non-re&s;idence and pluralities were the principal &s;ources of corruption among churchmen. We need not wonder therefore, if we find him inveigh|ing again&s;t them with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s. It mu&s;t be owned indeed, they were at that time &s;hamefully in u&s;e. It was no uncom|mon thing for a clergyman in tho&s;e days to hold three, and &s;ometimes four livings toge|ther. Mr. Stripe mentions one per&s;on who
<PB N="78" REF="80">held five. His name was Blage: he was a batchelor in divinity; and held at one time, St. Dun&s;tan's in the We&s;t, Whi&s;ton in York|&s;hire, and Donca&s;ter in the &s;ame county, Rugby in Warwick&s;hire, and Barnet in Middle&s;ex. The&s;e enormities, for &s;uch he e&s;teemed them, went to the heart of the pious archdeacon, and were the con&s;tant &s;ub|jects of his reproof. Sometimes he would &s;hew how wrong they were in them&s;elves, as ab&s;olutely contrary to the de&s;ign of en|dowments; at other times how injurious to the re&s;t of the order: 'While three parts out of four of the clergy, in his manner of &s;peaking, were picking what they could get off a common, the re&s;t were growing wan|ton with &s;tall-feeding.' But his great argu|ment again&s;t them was, the prejudice they did religion. 'It was rea&s;onable, he &s;aid, to think a pari&s;h would be better taken care of by the prie&s;t, who received the whole in|come, than by the curate, who received only a very &s;mall part; and would, it might ea&s;ily be imagined, too often proportion his pains to his allowance.' Be&s;ides, he thought, one man's engro&s;&s;ing what in all rea&s;on belonged
<PB N="79" REF="81">to two, perhaps three or four, agreed very ill with the &s;imple manners, and &s;eque&s;tred life of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; and gave an example which tended more to the di&s;credit of religion, than all the preaching in the world to its advancement.</P>
<P>With equal freedom he likewi&s;e cen&s;ured their private vices; frequently drawing the character of a bad clergyman, and dwelling upon &s;uch irregularities as he knew gave mo&s;t offence in the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The prudent bi&s;hop, ob&s;erving the for|wardne&s;s of his zeal, failed not to furni&s;h him with cautions in abundance; often re|minding him how prudently he ought to be|have, where, with all his prudence, he &s;hould &s;carce avoid giving offence&mdash;and his enemies, he &s;aid, could never want a handle again&s;t him, while popery reigned with &s;o much &s;everity.</P>
<P>But &s;uch repre&s;entations of danger had no effect: upon him. The common maxims in|deed of worldly prudence, he knew, were again&s;t him: but the examples he found in &s;cripture of holy men, who with equal free|dom
<PB N="80" REF="82">oppo&s;ed vice, and in times as danger|ous, wrought &s;trongly with him. If his en|deavours were at all &s;erviceable to religion, if they only &s;et &s;ome bounds to vice, he thought it criminal to check them through any motives of fear. It was his opinion, that when an employment was accepted, it &s;hould be accepted in all its parts: he thought no|thing was a greater breach of tru&s;t, or more de&s;tructive of common good, than to con|&s;ider public offices only as private emolu|ments.</P>
<P>It is however a little &s;urprizing, that the bi&s;hop of Durham, who knew the world &s;o well, &s;hould not fore&s;ee how much he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e his nephew to the popi&s;h party, by placing him in &s;uch a &s;tation. He knew he could not temporize; and he mu&s;t know, that without temporizing, he would &s;oon be mo&s;t obnoxious to tho&s;e in power; with who&s;e per&s;ecuting principles he was well acquainted. Had he provided for him in a way, which had no connexion with the clergy, it is probable he might have avoided tho&s;e dangers in which we &s;hall immediately find him. For his free reproofs &s;oon rou&s;ed
<PB N="81" REF="83">the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of tho&s;e parts again&s;t him, and put them upon every method in their power to remove &s;o inconvenient an enquirer. It was pre&s;ently the popular clamour, 'That he was an enemy to the church&mdash;a &s;canda|lizer of the clergy&mdash;a preacher of damnable doctrines&mdash;and that religion mu&s;t &s;uffer from the here&s;ies he was daily broaching, if they &s;pared him any longer. <Q>After I entered upon the par&s;onage of Ea&s;ington, &s;ays he, in a letter to his brother, and began to preach, I &s;oon procured me many mighty and grievous adver&s;aries, for that I preach|ed again&s;t pluralities and non-re&s;idence. Some &s;aid, all that preached that doctrine became heretics &s;oon after. Others found great fault, for that I preached repentance and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t; and did not make whole &s;ermons, as they did, about tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, purgatory, holy-water, images, prayers to &s;aints, and &s;uch like.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, in &s;hort, he had rai&s;ed a flame, which nothing but his blood could quench. Many articles were drawn up again&s;t him, and he was accu&s;ed in form before the bi|&s;hop of Durham.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">This pro&s;ecution was managed chiefly by one Dun&s;tal, a prie&s;t in tho&s;e parts, who had always di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as the archdea|con's implacable enemy: and as it was ima|gined the bi&s;hop's very great regard for Mr. Gilpin might probably ob&s;truct their de&s;igns, this per&s;on had been long employed by the party to work underhand, and prejudice the bi&s;hop again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Happy was it for him, that the prelate had as much di&s;cernment as humanity. He was practi&s;ed in the world: he knew what men and times would bear; and ea&s;ily found a method to protect his friend without endan|gering him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the cau&s;e came before him, 'He was extremely &s;orry to hear, that a per&s;on he had &s;o great a regard for &s;hould be accu&s;ed of here&s;y&mdash;that indeed him&s;elf had not been without &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of his leaning a little that way&mdash;but he had &s;till been in hopes there was nothing in his opinions of any dangerous con&s;equence to religion.&mdash;He &s;hould however be fairly examined; and if he appeared to be guilty, he &s;hould find a very &s;evere judge in the bi&s;hop of Durham.'</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">By this artful addre&s;s the bi&s;hop got the management of the affair into his own hands: and taking care to pre&s;s his accu&s;ed friend in points only in which he knew him able to bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> him off inno|cent; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e, telling the ac|cu&s;ers, 'He was afraid they had been too forward in their zeal for religion&mdash;and that here&s;y was &s;uch a crime, as no man ought to be charged with but upon the &s;tronge&s;t proof.'</P>
<P>The malice of his enemies could not how|ever re&s;t. His character at lea&s;t was in their power; for they had great influence upon the populace, of which they failed not to make the wor&s;t u&s;e, by infu&s;ing into tho&s;e, who were open to ha&s;ty impre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch &s;enti|ments, as they knew mo&s;t likely to inflame them. Several of his papers, yet remain|ing, &s;hew what candid interpreters they were of words and actions, which could po&s;&s;ibly be wre&s;ted to any bad meaning: one letter particularly, in which with great mildne&s;s he endeavours to free him&s;elf from the &s;lan|ders of &s;ome of his enemies, who had re|ported him to have affirmed, 'It was as law|ful
<PB N="84" REF="86">to have two wives as two livings.' He remembered indeed he had once been a&s;ked 'Whether of the two was wor&s;e?' and that he had carele&s;ly an&s;wered, 'He thought them both bad:' but to extend this to his affirming, 'They were both equally bad,' was perverting his meaning, he thought, in a very di&s;ingenuous manner.</P>
<P>The great fatigue Mr. Gilpin thus under|went in doing his duty in the double capacity of an archdeacon and a rector of a pari&s;h (and a very great fatigue it was in the con|&s;cientious manner in which he did it) he found at length too much for him: his &s;trength was indeed unequal to it; exhau&s;t|ed by &s;o long an oppo&s;ition to the &s;trong tide, which ran again&s;t him.&mdash;He acquaint|ed the bi&s;hop therefore, 'That he mu&s;t re|&s;ign either his archdeaconry, or his pari&s;h&mdash;that he would with the greate&s;t readine&s;s do his duty in which &s;oever his lord&s;hip thought him be&s;t qualified for; but he was not able to do it in both.'&mdash;'Have I not repeatedly told you, &s;aid the bi&s;hop, that you will die a beggar? Depend upon it you will, if you &s;uffer your con&s;cience to rai&s;e &s;uch unrea&s;on|able
<PB N="85" REF="87">&s;cruples. The archdeaconry and the living cannot be &s;eparated: the income of the former is not a &s;upport without that of the latter. I found them united, and am de|termined to leave them &s;o.'</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the bi&s;hop's refu&s;al to let him keep either of them &s;ingle, he mo&s;t probably re&s;igned them both; for I find him about this time without any office in the church.&mdash;During his being thus unemploy|ed, he lived with the bi&s;hop as one of his chaplains.</P>
<P>But even in this &s;ituation he found the malice of his enemies &s;till pur&s;uing him. The defeat they had received did not pre|vent their &s;eeking every opportunity of at|tacking him again. He avoided them as much as po&s;&s;ible; and they, on the other hand, contrived to meet him as frequently as they could; urging him continually upon &s;ome controverted point of religion, in con|tradiction often to the mo&s;t obvious rules of decency and good manners.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter gives us the par|ticulars of one of the&s;e di&s;putes; which, he &s;ays, he had often heard his kin&s;man, An|thony
<PB N="86" REF="88">Carleton &s;peak of, who at that time lived in the bi&s;hop of Durham's family.</P>
<P>Some of the bi&s;hop's chaplains getting about him in their accu&s;tomed manner, one of them a&s;ked him his opinion of the writings of Luther: Mr. Gilpin an&s;wered, 'He had never read them: that his method had al|ways been to &s;tudy the &s;criptures, and the father's expo&s;itions of them; but for the writings of modern divines, he was not &s;o well acquainted with them.' One of them, in a &s;neering manner, commended that as a right way of proceeding; and added, 'That if all men could but be per&s;uaded to be of Mr. Gilpin's opinion, to have the &s;ame ve|neration for antiquity that he had, the peace of the church would no longer be di&s;turbed with any of the&s;e novel teachers.' 'But &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Gilpin, the&s;e novel teach|ers, as you call them, have the &s;en&s;e of anti|quity on their &s;ide; what &s;hall we &s;ay then? Shall the antient doctrine be rejected, be|cau&s;e of the novel teacher?' This not &s;a|tisfying them, they began to urge him far|ther. 'Pray, &s;aid one of them, what are your thoughts about the real pre&s;ence?' Mr.
<PB N="87" REF="89">Gilpin an&s;wered, 'That he really knew no|thing of weight to object again&s;t it: but he thought it too my&s;terious a &s;ubject to bear a di&s;pute.' 'But do you believe tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation?' 'I believe every thing contained in the word of God.' 'But do you believe as the church believes?' 'Pray, &s;aid Mr. Gilpin, is the catholic faith unchangeable?' 'Undoubtedly it is.' 'But the church did not always hold tran&s;ub&s;tantiation an article of faith.' 'When did it not hold it &s;o?' 'Before the time of Peter Lombard, who fir&s;t intro|duced it: and even &s;ince his time it hath un|dergone an alteration. Pray, tell me; is not the bread in the &s;acrament converted into both the body and blood of Chri&s;t?' 'Un|doubtedly it is.' 'But, &s;aid Mr. Gilpin, &s;miling, Peter Lombard him&s;elf did not be|lieve that: for in the eleventh chapter of his fourth book, I very well remember, he &s;aith expre&s;ly, <Q>There is no tran&s;ub&s;tantiation but of bread into fle&s;h, and wine into blood.</Q> And now, I beg you will tell me how you reconcile the&s;e things with the unchangeable|ne&s;s of the catholic faith?' The chaplains had nothing to an&s;wer: for the words of
<PB N="88" REF="90">Lombard indeed plainly denied, that in the tran&s;ub&s;tantiated bread there could be any blood. Mr. Gilpin, ob&s;erving their confu|&s;ion, went on: 'It appears then, that tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation was never heard of in the church before the time of Peter Lombard: a man might have been a good catholic without ac|knowledging that doctrine till then: after|wards for a long time, the only meaning of it was, a conver&s;ion of the bread into fle&s;h, and the wine into blood: and thus it re|mained, till Thomas Aquinas introduced his notion of concomitancy; at which time this doctrine underwent another change: both fle&s;h and blood were then, it &s;eems, contain|ed really and &s;ub&s;tantially in the bread alone.&mdash;Alas! alas! I am afraid the&s;e are the no|vel opinions that have got in among&s;t us: the catholic faith, we are both agreed, is un|changeable.' The bi&s;hop was &s;itting before the fire in the fame chamber, where this con|ver&s;ation happened; and leaning back in his chair, over-heard it. When it was over, he got up, and turning to his chaplains, &s;aid to them with &s;ome emotion, 'Come, come,
<PB N="89" REF="91">leave him, leave him; I find he has more learning than all of you put together.'</P>
<P>From Mr. Gilpin's behaviour upon this occa&s;ion, his zeal appears to have been tem|pered with a good deal of prudence. In|deed it never ro&s;e &s;o high, as to become dan|gerous to him, but when he thought his duty ab&s;olutely required it. In general he was very cautious; and well guarded again&s;t the captious que&s;tions of &s;uch, as were con|tinually lying in wait to intrap him.</P>
<P>How long Mr. Gilpin remained unbene|ficed, doth not appear. It could not how|ever be very long, becau&s;e the rectory of Houghton-le-&s;pring fell vacant, before Ea|&s;ington, and the archdeaconry, were di&s;|po&s;ed of; and the bi&s;hop, in a jocular way, made him an offer of all the three. But that offer it was not likely he would li&s;ten to. He thanked the bi&s;hop however, and accept|ed Houghton.</P>
<P>This rectory was indeed of con&s;iderable value, but the duty of it was proportionably laborious. It was &s;o exten&s;ive, that it con|tained no le&s;s than fourteen villages: and having been as much neglected in that dark
<PB N="90" REF="92">age, as the cures in the north then ordinarily were, popery had produced its full growth of &s;uper&s;tition in it. Scarce any traces in|deed of true chri&s;tianity were left. Nay, what little religion remained, was even po|pery it&s;elf corrupted. All its idle ceremonies were here carried higher than you would perhaps any where el&s;e find them; and were more con&s;idered as the e&s;&s;entials of religion. How entirely this barbarous people were ex|cluded from all means of better information, appears from hence, that in that part of the kingdom, through the de&s;igned neglect of bi&s;hops and ju&s;tices of the peace, king Ed|ward's proclamations for a change of wor|&s;hip had not even been heard of at the time of that prince's death.</P>
<P>Such was the condition of the pari&s;h of Houghton, when it was committed to Mr. Gilpin's care: a wa&s;te &s;o mi&s;erably unculti|vated, that the greate&s;t indu&s;try &s;eemed but &s;ufficient to bring it into any kind of order; and the greate&s;t re&s;olution only to make the attempt. But when the good of mankind was concerned, this true mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel had re&s;olution enough to attempt whatever in|du&s;try
<PB N="91" REF="93">could accompli&s;h. He was grieved to &s;ee ignorance and vice &s;o lamentably prevail: but he did not de&s;pair. He implored the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of God; and his &s;incere endeavours met with it. The people crouded about him, and heard him with attention, per|ceiving him a teacher of a different kind from tho&s;e, to whom they had hitherto been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>Upon his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Houghton, it was &s;ome mortification to him, that he could not immediately re&s;ide. His par&s;on|age-hou&s;e was gone entirely to decay; and &s;ome time was required to make it habitable. Part of it was fitted up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for his reception: but he continued improv|ing and enlarging it, till it became &s;uitable to his ho&s;pitable temper, a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had to him&s;elf. <Q>His hou&s;e, &s;ays the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, was like a bi&s;hop's palace; &s;uperior indeed to mo&s;t bi&s;hops hou&s;es, with re&s;pect both to the largene&s;s of the building, and the elegance of the &s;itua|tion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">Soon after this late in&s;tance of the bi&s;hop's favour to him, another opportunity offered, by which this generous patron hoped &s;till further to improve his fortune. A &s;tall in the cathedral of Durham was vacant, which he urged Mr. Gilpin in the mo&s;t friendly manner to accept, telling him, 'There lay not the &s;ame objection to this as to the arch|deaconry&mdash;that it was quite a &s;ine cure&mdash;and that he could have no rea&s;onable pretence for refu&s;ing it.' But Mr. Gilpin, re&s;olving not to accept it, told the bi&s;hop, 'That by his bounty he had already more wealth, than, he was afraid, he could give a good account of. He begged therefore he might not have an additional charge; but that his lord&s;hip would rather be&s;tow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted.' The bi&s;hop knew by long experience it was in vain to pre&s;s him to what he did not approve; &s;o there was no more &s;aid of the prebend.</P>
<P>Though he lived now retired, and gave no offence to the clergy, their malice how|ever &s;till pur&s;ued him. They ob&s;erved with indignation the &s;trong contra&s;t between his life and theirs. His care and labour were
<PB N="93" REF="95">a &s;tanding &s;atyr upon their negligence and &s;loth; and it was the language of their hearts, 'By &s;o living thou reproache&s;t us.' In a word, they were determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to extingui&s;h a light, which &s;hewed them to &s;uch di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>But they had not the ea&s;ie&s;t part to ma|nage. The country favoured him; the bi|&s;hop was his friend; and no good man his enemy. Be&s;ides, the ma&s;k of religion mu&s;t needs be kept on; and they found Mr. Gil|pin's zeal not &s;o intemperate as might be wi&s;hed. However, what malice could do was not wanting: every engine was &s;et at work; and ba&s;e emi&s;&s;aries employed in all parts to &s;eek out matter for an accu&s;ation of him. Of all this Mr. Gilpin was &s;en&s;ible, and behaved as cautiou&s;ly as he thought con|&s;i&s;tent with his duty; indeed more cautiou&s;ly than he could afterwards approve: for, in his future life, he would often tax his beha|viour at this time with weakne&s;s and cow|ardice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But had his caution been greater, again&s;t &s;uch vigilant enemies it had probably been
<PB N="94" REF="96">&s;till ineffectual. The eyes of numbers were con&s;tantly upon him, and &s;carce an action of his life e&s;caped them. Of this malicious in|du&s;try we have the following in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A woman in the pangs of child-bed im|ploring God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was rebuked by tho&s;e around her for not rather praying to the vir|gin Mary. Alarmed by her danger, and greatly de&s;irous of knowing whether God or the virgin was more likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;he begged, 'The great preacher lately come from abroad, might be &s;ent for: &s;he was &s;ure he would come, and could tell her what &s;he &s;hould do.' Mr. Gilpin told her, 'He dur&s;t not per&s;uade her to call upon the virgin Mary; but in praying to God, &s;he might be &s;ure &s;he did right&mdash;that there were many expre&s;s commands in &s;cripture for it&mdash;and that God would certainly hear them who prayed earne&s;tly to him.' Mr. Gilpin &s;poke the more freely, as he thought what he &s;aid was not likely to be carried abroad. But he was afterwards &s;urprized to find it had not e&s;caped the vigilance of his enemies, who failed not to make the wor&s;t u&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">By &s;o unwearied an indu&s;try &s;uch a num|ber of articles were in a &s;hort time got to|gether, as, it was eagerly imagined, could not but cru&s;h him. He was &s;oon therefore formally accu&s;ed, and brought once more be|fore the bi&s;hop of Durham. How the bi&s;hop behaved at this time we are not par|ticularly informed. But no man knew better how to act upon an emergency. It is pro|bable he would vary his management; but it is certain Mr. Gilpin was acquitted.</P>
<P>The malice of his enemies &s;ucceeded how|ever in part; for the bi&s;hop's favour to him from this time vi&s;ibly declined: though it is que&s;tionable, whether he really felt the in|difference he expre&s;&s;ed; or he thought it ad|vi&s;eable thus far to temporize; hoping to deduct the &s;um of his own from the ill-will of others. It is rather probable however that his indifference was not affected: for the bi&s;hop was a very prudent man; and when he found, that his kin&s;man's piety (carried, he thought, in many in&s;tances, to a &s;trange extreme) began to involve him&s;elf in inconveniencies and &s;u&s;picions, which it had been his principal care throughout his
<PB N="96" REF="98">life to avoid; it is not unlikely, that he might judge his friend&s;hip had led him too far from his own prudential maxims of behaviour, and that he might re&s;olve to endanger his quiet no longer for the &s;ake of a man who&s;e ob|&s;tinacy was in&s;uperable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About ea&s;ter I was accu&s;ed again before the bi&s;hop in many articles both from York and Durham: but the&s;e could take no farther hold again&s;t me, than only to make the bi&s;hop to blot me out of his te&s;tament; and to make the vulgar people &s;peak evil of me. For lo&s;ing the di&s;|po&s;al of the bi&s;hop's goods, I thought I was well unbur|thened; and for the people's favour, to the end I might more edify in preaching (otherwi&s;e I did not covet it) I tru&s;ted time, through God's goodne&s;s, would bring it again. Extract of a letter from Bernard Gilpin to his brother.</P></NOTE>. This was not le&s;s than Mr. Gilpin expected, nor more than he was well provided for. He acknowledged his great obligations to the bi&s;hop; was &s;orry to &s;ee him di&s;gu&s;ted; and would have given up any thing, to have him &s;atisfied, except his con&s;cience. But a good con&s;cience, he was a&s;&s;ured, was his be&s;t friend, and was re|&s;olved not to part with it for any friend upon earth.</P>
<P>His enemies, in the mean time, were not thus &s;ilenced. Though they had been de|feated a &s;econd time, they were only the
<PB N="97" REF="99">more &s;pirited up by that additional rancour, which generally attends the baffled de&s;igns of the malicious. Convinced however they now were, how impo&s;&s;ible it was to work up the bi&s;hop of Durham's zeal to the height they wi&s;hed; and began to &s;u&s;pect he was either le&s;s orthodox him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t too much Mr. Gilpin's friend to have any hand in his condemnation. They thought indeed, if it could have been &s;o brought about, it would have given them lea&s;t trouble, and mo&s;t &s;a|tisfaction, to have had him burnt at Durham; but as that could not be well effected, they were determined to try whether it could not be done el&s;ewhere. Thirty-two articles were accordingly drawn up again&s;t him in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, and laid before bi&s;hop Bon|ner of London.</P>
<P>Here they went the right way to work. Bonner was ju&s;t the rever&s;e of Tun&s;tal; form|ed by nature for an inqui&s;itor, and the pro|pere&s;t agent their malice could have employ|ed. The fierce zealot at once took fire; ex|tolled their laudable concern for religion; and promi&s;ed that the heretic &s;hould be at a &s;take in a fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">Mr. Gilpin's friends in London trembled for his &s;afety, and in&s;tantly di&s;patched a me&s;|&s;age&mdash;that he had not a moment to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger did not &s;urprize him. He had long been preparing him&s;elf to &s;uffer for the truth, and he now determined not to de|cline it. It was in &s;ome &s;ort, he thought, denying his faith, to be backward in giving the be&s;t te&s;timony to it. If it was proper he &s;hould be delivered, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf that God would take his own method to de|liver him. He was indeed in a great mea|fure weaned from the world; daily more con|vinced of its vanity; and more confirmed in his re&s;olutions of con&s;idering it merely as a &s;tate preparatory to eternity: and as it was the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to promote religion, if he could better effect this by his death, it was his wi&s;h to die.</P>
<P>He received the account therefore with great compo&s;ure; and immediately after call|ed up William Airay, a favourite dome&s;tic, who had long &s;erved him as his almoner and &s;teward; and laying his hand upon his &s;houl|der, 'At length, &s;ays he, they have prevail|ed again&s;t me&mdash;I am accu&s;ed to the bi&s;hop
<PB N="99" REF="101">of London, from whom there will be no e&s;caping&mdash;God forgive their malice, and grant me &s;trength to undergo the trial.' He then ordered his &s;ervant to provide a long garment for him, in which he might go decently to the &s;take; and de&s;ired it might be got ready with all expedition; 'For I know not, &s;ays he, how &s;oon I may have occa&s;ion for it.'</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this garment was provided, it is &s;aid, he u&s;ed to put it on every day till the bi&s;hop's me&s;&s;engers apprehended him.</P>
<P>His friends in the mean time failed not to interpo&s;e; earne&s;tly be&s;eeching him, while he had yet an opportunity, to provided for his &s;afety. But he begged them not to pre&s;s him longer upon that &s;ubject: &s;hould he even attempt it, he &s;aid, he believed it would hardly be in his power to e&s;cape; for he que&s;|tioned not but all his motions were very nar|rowly ob&s;erved.&mdash;Be&s;ides, he would a&s;k, how they could imagine he would prefer the mi&s;erable life of an exile, before the joyful death of a martyr? 'Be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ays he, I &s;hould never have thrown my&s;elf voluntarily into the hands of my enemies; but I am fully determined to per&s;evere in doing my
<PB N="100" REF="102">duty, and &s;hall take no mea&s;ures to avoid them.'</P>
<P>In a few days the me&s;&s;engers apprehended him, and put an end to the&s;e &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>In his way to London, it is &s;aid, he broke his leg, which put a &s;top for &s;ome time to his journey. The pre&s;ons, in who&s;e cu&s;today he was, took occa&s;ion thence maliciou&s;ly to retort upon him an ob&s;ervation he would fre|quently make, 'That nothing happens to us but what is intended for our good;' a&s;king him, Whether he thought his broken leg was &s;o intended? He an&s;wered meekly, 'He made no que&s;tion but it was.' And indeed &s;o it proved in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e: for before he was able to travel, queen Mary died, and he was &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Whatever truth there may be in this rela|tion, thus much however is certain: the ac|count of the queen's death met him upon the road, and put a &s;top to any farther pro&s;ecu|tion.</P>

<P>MR. Gilpin, thus providentially re&s;cued from his enemies, returned to Hough|ton through crouds of people, expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t joy, and ble&s;&s;ing God for his deli|verance.</P>
<P>Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion freed him now from all re&s;traints, and allowed him the liberty he had long wi&s;hed for of &s;peaking his mind plainly to his pari&s;hioners; tho' no-body but him&s;elf thought the re&s;erve he had hitherto u&s;ed at all faulty.</P>
<P>It was now his friend the bi&s;hop of Dur|ham's turn to &s;uffer. He and &s;ome other bi&s;hops, refu&s;ing the oath of &s;upremacy, were deprived and committed to the tower. But this &s;everity &s;oon relaxed: to the bi&s;hop of Durham e&s;pecially the government &s;hewed as much lenity as was thought con&s;i&s;tent with the reformation then carrying on. He was recommended to the care of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; with whom he &s;pent in great tranquility the &s;hort remainder of a very long life.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">This prelate had &s;een as great a variety of fortune as mo&s;t men; he had lived in difficult and in ea&s;y times; he had known both pro|te&s;tants and papi&s;ts in power; and yet from all parties, and in all revolutions of govern|ment, he had found favour. The truth is, he was well ver&s;ed in the arts of temporiz|ing; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of that com|plying philo&s;ophy, which taking offence at nothing, can adapt it&s;elf to all things. When Harry the eighth began to innovate, the bi|&s;hop of Durham had no &s;cruples. When his &s;on went farther, &s;till the bi&s;hop was quiet, and owed indeed his confinement at the clo&s;e of that reign to his de&s;ire of continuing &s;o. Again, when queen Mary rever&s;ed what they had done; with this too the bi&s;hop was &s;a|tisfied, and forgot all his &s;ormer profe&s;&s;ions. Thus much however may ju&s;tly be &s;aid of him, that upon all occa&s;ions, and where no &s;ecular ends were in view, he &s;hewed him&s;elf a man of great moderation: and whether in his heart he was more papi&s;t or prote&s;tant, to ar|bitrary proceedings however in either per&s;ua|&s;ion he was wholly aver&s;e. Thus he thought things were carried too far on one &s;ide in king
<PB N="103" REF="105">Edward's time, and too far on the other in queen Mary's: with both reigns he was therefore di&s;&s;atisfied, though he was too great a lover of his ea&s;e to oppo&s;e them. But as his days &s;hortened, his ambition decrea&s;ed, his con&s;cience grew more tender, and what he had done for king Harry and king Ed|ward, he refu&s;ed to do again for queen Eli|zabeth. Though the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury is of opinion, he was not with-held by any &s;cruples, but &s;uch as a &s;en&s;e of decency rai&s;ed, from complying with that prince&s;s: he was very old, and thought it looked better to un|dergo the &s;ame fate with his brethren, than to be &s;till changing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Burnet's hi&s;tory of the reformation.</NOTE>. And this is the rather probable, becau&s;e many hi&s;torians &s;ay, the late reign had given him a great di&s;gu&s;t to popery; and that he would often own to archbi&s;hop Parker, he began to think every day more favourably of the reformers.&mdash;In private life his manners were very commend|able. He had an ab&s;olute command over him&s;elf; a temper which no accident could di&s;compo&s;e; great humanity, and great good nature. In learning, few of his contempo|raries
<PB N="104" REF="106">were equal to him; none more ready to patronize it. Of the offices of friend&s;hip he was a &s;trict ob&s;erver; and was not only a favourer, but a zealous encourager of good men. In a word, where he was not imme|diately under the influence of court-maxims, he gave the example of a true chri&s;tian bi|&s;hop.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin, though deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of this great prelate, &s;oon experienced however, that worth like his could never be left friendle&s;s. His merit rai&s;ed him friends wherever he was known; and though his piety was &s;uch, that he never propo&s;ed re|putation as the end of his actions; yet per|haps few of his profe&s;&s;ion &s;tood at this time higher in the public e&s;teem. <Q>He was re|&s;pected, &s;ay the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, not only by the more eminent churchmen, but by tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank in the nation.</Q></P>
<P>When the popi&s;h bi&s;hops were deprived, and many &s;ees by that means vacant, Mr. Gilpin's friends at court, particularly the earl of Bedford, thought it a good opportunity to u&s;e their intere&s;t in his favour. He was re|commended accordingly to the queen as a
<PB N="105" REF="107">proper per&s;on for one of the void bi&s;hoprics: upon which, as he was a north-country man, &s;he nominated him to that of Carli&s;le; and the earl took immediate care that a cong&eacute; d' elire, with her maje&s;ty's recommendation of him, &s;hould be &s;ent down to the dean and chapter of that &s;ee.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin, who knew nothing of what was going forward in his favour, was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected honour; yet could not by any means per&s;uade him&s;elf to accept it. He &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger therefore with a letter to the earl, expre&s;&s;ing his great obli|gations to her maje&s;ty and his lord&s;hip for their favourable &s;entiments of him&mdash;but beg|ged they would excu&s;e his accepting their intended kindne&s;s&mdash;they had really thought of placing him in a &s;tation which he did not merit&mdash;he mu&s;t therefore remove from him|&s;elf a burden to which he, who was be&s;t ac|quainted with his own weakne&s;s, knew him|&s;elf unequal&mdash;in the mean time he would not fail to do his utmo&s;t for the &s;ervice of reli|gion in an inferior employment.</P>
<P>The earl, upon the receipt of this letter, went immediately to Dr. Sandys, bi&s;hop of
<PB N="106" REF="108">Worce&s;ter, who was then in London. As this prelate was intimately acquainted with Mr. Gilpin, and, as the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter &s;ays, nearly related to him, the earl &s;uppo&s;ed he could not be without his influence over him; and therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ired he would endeavour to per&s;uade his friend to think le&s;s meanly of him&s;elf. The bi&s;hop readily un|dertook the office, and wrote the following letter to Mr. Gilpin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original is lo&s;t, but the bi&s;nop of Chiche&s;ter has pre&s;erved a latin tran&s;lation of it, from which this is taken.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>My much re&s;pected kin&s;man, regarding not &s;o much your private intere&s;t, as the in|tere&s;t of religion, I did what I could, that the bi&s;hopric of Carli&s;le might be &s;ecured to you: and the ju&s;t character I gave of you to the queen has, I doubt not, had &s;ome weight with her maje&s;ty in her pro|moting of you to that &s;ee; which not to mention the honour of it, will enable you to be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to the church of Chri&s;t.&mdash;I am not ignorant how much rather you chu&s;e a private &s;tation: but if you con&s;ider the condition of the church

</LETTER>
<P>This letter, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ing manner in which it is written, was without effect. Mr. Gilpin returned his thanks; but
<PB N="108" REF="110">as for the bi&s;hopric, he was determined, and he thought for very good rea&s;ons, not to ac|cept it. Nor could all the per&s;ua&s;ions of his friends alter this re&s;olution. Had he, they a&s;ked him, any &s;cruple of con&s;cience about it?&mdash;In one &s;en&s;e he had: 'The ca&s;e, &s;ays he, is truly this: if any other bi&s;hopric, be|&s;ides Carli&s;le, had been offered to me, I po&s;|&s;ibly might have accepted it: but in that dio|ce&s;e I have &s;o many friends and acquaintance, of whom I have not the be&s;t opinion, that I mu&s;t either connive at many irregulari|ties, or draw upon my&s;elf &s;o much hatred, that I &s;hould be le&s;s able to do good there than any one el&s;e.'</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin thus per&s;i&s;ting in his refu&s;al, the bi&s;hopric was was at length given to Dr. Be&s;t, a man by no means unde&s;erving of it.</P>
<P>This prelate &s;oon found he had entered upon a very di&s;agreeable and vexatious office. His cathedral was filled with an illiterate &s;et of men, who had been formerly monks: <Q>For, as Camden tells us, the greater part of the popi&s;h prie&s;ts thought it would turn to better account to renounce the pope's authority, and &s;wear allegiance to the queen,
<PB N="109" REF="111">were it for no other end than the exclu&s;ion of prote&s;tants out of their churches, and the relief of &s;uch of their own party, who had been di&s;placed. This they judged a piece of di&s;cretion highly meritorious, and hoped the pope would be &s;o good as di&s;|pen&s;e with their oath on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</Q> The dioce&s;e of Carli&s;le was much in this &s;ituation; and indeed the people there were as &s;trongly inclined to the &s;uper&s;titions of popery as the prie&s;ts. This di&s;po&s;ition of the coun|try, whetted by the prelate's rigid oppo&s;ition, who was not a man the mo&s;t happily quali|fied to manage unruly tempers, began to &s;hew it&s;elf in very violent effects. The whole dio|ce&s;e was &s;oon in a flame; and the bi&s;hop, after two years re&s;idence, was obliged to re|pair to London, and make a formal complaint to his &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>This vexation which the popi&s;h party was likely to give to any one placed in the &s;ee of Carli&s;le, is imagined, by the author of arch|bi&s;hop Grindal's life, to be a principal rea&s;on why Mr. Gilpin refu&s;ed it. But this would have been as good a rea&s;on for his refu&s;ing the rectory of Houghton, or any other em|ployment
<PB N="110" REF="112">in the church: for popery prevail|ed univer&s;ally over the country; and he could be placed no where in the north without ex|periencing a toil&s;ome oppo&s;ition to the bigotry and prejudices of it. But his own ea&s;e and convenience were never motives of the lea&s;t weight with him, when any &s;ervice to man|kind could be balanced again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The accounts given us by bi&s;hop Nichol|&s;on and Dr. Heylin of Mr. Gilpin's beha|viour upon this occa&s;ion are &s;till more di&s;in|genuous: they both a&s;cribe it chiefly to lu|crative motives. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his hi&s;torical library.</NOTE> former intimates, that the good man knew what he was about, when he refu&s;ed to part with the rectory of Houghton for the bi&s;hopric of Carli&s;le: the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his church hi&s;tory.</NOTE> latter &s;uppo&s;es, that all his &s;cruples would have vani&s;hed, might he have had the old temporalities undimini&s;hed. Both the&s;e wri|ters &s;eem to have been very little acquainted with Mr. Gilpin's character, in which di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s bore &s;o principal a part: it will hereafter appear, that he con&s;idered his in|come in no other light than that of a fund to
<PB N="111" REF="113">be managed for the common good. The bi&s;hop's in&s;inuation therefore is contradicted by every action of Mr. Gilpin's life: and as for Dr. Heylin's, it is mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; for the bi&s;hopric was offered to him with the old temporalities undimini&s;hed *.</P>
<P>There were not wanting &s;ome who attri|buted his refu&s;al of the bi&s;hopric to unfavour|able &s;entiments of epi&s;copacy. But neither for this was there any good foundation. He was indeed far from being a bigot to that or any other form of church government, e&s;teem|ing a good life, which might be led under any of them, the be&s;t evidence of a chri&s;tian. Yet he &s;eems to have thought mo&s;t favourably of the epi&s;copal form; as will appear after|wards, when notice is taken of the endea|vours of the di&s;&s;enters to draw him to their party.</P>
<P>The year after his refu&s;al of the bi&s;hopric of Carli&s;le, an offer of another kind was made him.</P>
<P>The provo&s;t&s;hip of Queen's-college in Ox|ford becoming vacant &s;oon after Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion; and the fellows who were &s;trongly <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter's letter, p. 107.</NOTE>
<PB N="112" REF="114">tached to popery, being about to chu&s;e a per|&s;on inclined the &s;ame way, the queen, with their vi&s;itor the archbi&s;hop of York, inter|po&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their electing Dr. Francis. The fellows were much out of hu|mour at this proceeding; and the affair made &s;ome noi&s;e in the univer&s;ity, where the popi&s;h party was very &s;trong. At length however the queen's recommendation took effect. But though the fellows had thus cho&s;en the per|&s;on recommended to them, yet their beha|viour was &s;o undutiful towards him, that he was &s;oon weary of his office; and in le&s;s than a year began to think of re&s;igning it. Mr. Gilpin was the per&s;on he turned his thoughts on for a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; apprehending that &s;uch a change would not be unplea&s;ing to the fel|lows, and very agreeable to the queen. He made him an offer therefore of re&s;igning in his favour: but not &s;ucceeding the fir&s;t time, he wrote again; begging at lea&s;t that he would recommend to him &s;ome proper per|&s;on, and a&s;&s;uring him with what readine&s;s he would acquie&s;ce in his choice. His &s;econd letter is &s;till pre&s;erved.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>How Mr. Gilpin an&s;wered this letter doth not appear; nor whether he recommended a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the di&s;&s;atisfied provo&s;t: this
<PB N="114" REF="116">only is certain, that he refu&s;ed the offer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus having had in his option almo&s;t every kind of preferment which an eccle&s;ia&s;tic is capable of holding, he &s;at down with one living, which gratified the utmo&s;t of his de|&s;ires&mdash;for he found it afforded him as many opportunities of doing good, as he was able to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Soon after Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion, a general vi&s;itation was held. An a&s;&s;embly of divines, among whom were Parker, Grindal, and Sandys, having fini&s;hed a body of injunctions and articles, commi&s;&s;ions were i&s;&s;ued out, im|powering proper per&s;ons to inforce them: the oath of &s;upremacy was to be tendered to the clergy, and a &s;ub&s;cription impo&s;ed. When the vi&s;itors came to Durham, Mr. Gilpin was &s;ent to, and reque&s;ted to preach before the clergy there, again&s;t the pope's &s;upremacy. To this he had no objection: but he did not like the thoughts of &s;ub&s;cribing, having &s;ome doubts with regard to one or more of the ar|ticles. His curate having not the&s;e &s;cruples, he hoped that his &s;ub&s;cription might &s;atisfy the vi&s;itors. But he was mi&s;taken; for the
<PB N="115" REF="117">next day, when the clergy were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ub&s;cribe, as an in&s;tance of re&s;pect, Mr. Gil|pin was fir&s;t called upon. The emergency allowed him no time for reflection. He ju&s;t con&s;idered with him&s;elf, that upon the whole, the&s;e alterations in religion were certainly right&mdash;that he doubted only in a few imma|terial points&mdash;and that if he &s;hould refu&s;e, it might be a means to keep others back. He then took up the pen, and, with &s;ome he&s;i|tation, at length &s;ub&s;cribed. Afterwards re|tiring, he &s;ent a letter to the vi&s;itors, acquaint|ing them in what &s;en&s;e he &s;ub&s;cribed the ar|ticles; which they accepted very favourably.</P>
<P>The great ignorance which at this time prevailed over the nation, afforded a melan|choly pro&s;pect to all who had the intere&s;t of religion at heart. To it was owing that gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition which kept reformation every where &s;o long at a &s;tand; a &s;uper&s;tition which was like to continue; for all the chan|nels through which knowledge could flow, were choaked up. There were few &s;chools in the nation; and the&s;e as ill &s;upplied as they were endowed. The univer&s;ities were in the hands of bigots, collecting their &s;trength
<PB N="116" REF="118">to defend ab&s;urdities, neglecting all good learn|ing. At Cambridge indeed &s;ome advances in u&s;eful literature were made; &s;ir John Cheke, Roger A&s;cham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Sir John Cheke was fellow of St. John's, and after|wards tutor to Edward the &s;ixth. In queen Mary's time he fled into Germany; but by a trick was brought home, and recanted to &s;ave his life; <Q>A great example (&s;ays Lloyd in his &s;tate-worthies) of parts and ingenuity, of frailty and infirmity, of repentance and piety.</Q>&mdash;Roger A&s;cham was fellow of the &s;ame college; and profe&s;&s;or of oratory in the univer&s;ity; afterwards tutor and &s;ecretary to queen Elizabeth. He was a man of great learning, hone&s;ty and indi&s;cretion.</P></NOTE>, and a few others, having boldly &s;truck out a new path through that wilderne&s;s of fal&s;e &s;cience, which involved them: but they were yet lazily followed.</P>
<P>The very bad con&s;equences which could not but be feared from this extreme igno|rance, turned the endeavours of all well-wi&s;hers to the progre&s;s of true religion upon the mo&s;t probable methods to remove it. The queen her&s;elf was greatly intere&s;ted in this cau&s;e, and earne&s;tly recommended it to the care of her council. Her court was the &s;eat of learning, as well as the &s;chool of po|litene&s;s: here the &s;cholar was had in equal e&s;teem with the &s;tate&s;man and &s;oldier; and here all parts of literature found their re&s;pec|tive
<PB N="117" REF="119">patrons, who began to vie with each other in their endeavours to root out fal&s;e &s;cience, as they had already done fal&s;e re|ligion.</P>
<P>No good work ever went forward, which Mr. Gilpin did not promote, as far as he was able. In this he joined to the utmo&s;t of his abilities&mdash;as was commonly indeed thought, beyond them. His manner of living was the mo&s;t affluent, and generous: his ho&s;pitality made daily a large demand upon him; and his bounty and charities a much larger. His acquaintance therefore could not but wonder to find him, amid&s;t &s;uch great expences, en|tertaining the de&s;ign of building and endow|ing a grammar-&s;chool: a de&s;ign however which his very exact oeconomy &s;oon enabled him to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>The effects of his endowment were very quickly &s;een. His &s;chool was no &s;ooner open|ed than it began to flouri&s;h, and to afford the agreeable pro&s;pect of a &s;ucceeding generation ri&s;ing above the ignorance and errors of their forefathers.</P>
<P>That &s;uch might be its effects, no care on his part was wanting. He not only placed
<PB N="118" REF="120">able ma&s;ters in his &s;chool, whom he procur|ed from Oxford, but him&s;elf likewi&s;e con|&s;tantly in&s;pected it. And that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the mo&s;t for|ward: he would call them his own &s;chplars, and would &s;end for them, often into his &s;tudy, and there in&s;truct: them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>One method u&s;ed by him to fill his &s;chool was a little &s;ingular. Whenever he met a poor boy upon the road, he would make trial of his capacity by a few que&s;tions; and if he found it &s;uch as plea&s;ed him, he would pro|vide for his education.</P>
<P>Nor did his care end here. From his &s;chool he &s;ent &s;everal to the univer&s;ities, where he maintained them wholly at his own expence. To others, who were in cir|cum&s;tances to do &s;omething for them&s;elves, he would give the farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance they needed. By which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal edu|cation, who otherwi&s;e would not have done it. For all ambition of that kind was extin|gui&s;hed. While the church was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its immen&s;e wealth, the univer&s;ities were
<PB N="119" REF="121">always full: but when this was taken away, it &s;oon appeared that the mu&s;es, unportioned, had in tho&s;e days very few charms: their ha|bitations were no longer crouded with a train of admirers. In king Edward's reign bi&s;hop Latymer calculated, that even in that &s;hort|&s;pace of time &s;ince the alienation of the church-lands, the two univer&s;ities were di|mini&s;hed by above ten thou&s;and per&s;ons; a number almo&s;t incredible.</P>
<P>Nor did Mr. Gilpin think it enough to af|ford the means only of an academical educa|tion to the&s;e young people, but endeavoured with the utmo&s;t care to make it as beneficial to them as he could. He &s;till con&s;idered him&s;elf as their proper guardian; and &s;eem|ed to think him&s;elf bound to the public for their being made u&s;eful members of it, as far as ever it lay in his power to make them &s;o. With this view he held a punctual corre&s;|pondence with their tutors; and made the youths them&s;elves likewi&s;e frequently write to him, and give him an account of their &s;tu|dies. Several of their letters, chie&s;ly pre|&s;erved by having &s;omething of Mr. Gilpin's written upon their backs, &s;till remain, and
<PB N="120" REF="122">&s;hew in how great veneration he was held among them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An extract from one of the&s;e letters is worth pre|&s;erving.

<Q>The terrible di&s;temper among us, of which you have undoubtedly heard, hath made it indeed a dreadful time to us. During the fir&s;t &s;ix days there died ninety-five; &s;eventy of whom were &s;cholars. This is not conjec|ture, but appears from the mayor's li&s;t The infection does not confine it&s;elf to the town, but begins to &s;pread in the country; where, if our accounts are true, it hath carried off numbers of people: among&s;t them poor Mr. Roberts. Tho&s;e who are &s;eized with it are in the utmo&s;t torment: their bowels are burnt up: they call earne&s;tly for drink: they cannot bear the touch of cloaths: they intreat the &s;tanders by to throw cold water upon them: &s;ometimes they are quite mad; ri&s;e upon their keepers; run naked out of hou&s;es; and often endeavour to put an end to their lives.&mdash;The phy&s;icians are confounded, declaring they have met with nothing &s;imilar, either in their reading or prac|tice. Yet many of them give this di&s;temper a name, though they have done nothing to &s;hew they are at all acquainted with its nature. The greater part of them, I am told, have how left the town, either out of fear for them&s;elves, or con&s;cious that they can do no good.&mdash;This dreadful di&s;temper is now generally attributed to &s;ome jail in&s;ection, brought into court at the a&s;&s;izes: for it is remarkable, that the fir&s;t infected were tho&s;e only who had been there.&mdash;Few women or old men have died.&mdash;God be thanked, the rage of this pe&s;tilence is now much abated, It is &s;till among us in &s;ome de|gree, but its effects appear every day weaker.&mdash;</Q></NOTE>. So &s;olicitous indeed was he about them, knowing the many temptations to which their age and &s;ituation expo&s;ed them,
<PB N="121" REF="123">that once every other year he generally made a journey to the univer&s;ities, to in&s;pect their behaviour.</P>
<P>Nor was this uncommon care unrewarded. Few of his &s;cholars mi&s;carried: <Q>Many of them, &s;ays the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, be|came great ornaments to the church; and very exemplary ir&s;tances of piety.</Q></P>
<P>Among tho&s;e of any note, who were edu|cated by him, I find the&s;e three particularly mentioned; Henry Ayray, George Carleton, and Hugh Broughton.</P>
<P>Henry Ayray became afterwards provo&s;t of Queen's-college in Oxford; where he was in great e&s;teem for his abilities, and exemplary life.</P>
<P>George Carleton was a man of worth and learning, and very de&s;ervedly promoted to the &s;ee of Chiche&s;ter. It might have been added, that he was much care&s;&s;ed and employed by James I. but the favours of that undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing monarch reflected no great honour upon the objects of them.</P>
<P>Hugh Broughton was indeed famous in his time, and as a man of letters e&s;teemed by many, but in every other light de&s;picable. He was a remarkable in&s;tance of the danger
<PB N="122" REF="124">of learning without common &s;en&s;e. During the younger part of his life he confined him|&s;elf to a college library, where his trifling ge|nius engaged him chiefly in rabbinical learn|ing, in which indeed he made a notable pro|gre&s;s. Thus accompli&s;hed, he came abroad, with an opinion of him&s;elf equalled only by his &s;overeign contempt for others. As he wanted that mode&s;t diffidence which is the natural guard of a per&s;on unacquainted with the world, he &s;oon involved him&s;elf in diffi|culties. London was the &s;cene where he fir&s;t expo&s;ed him&s;elf. Here for &s;ome time he paid a &s;ervile court to the vulgar, in the capacity of a popular preacher: but afterwards giv|ing a freer &s;cope to his vanity, he &s;et up a conventicle; where a&s;&s;uming the air of an original, he treated the opinions of the times, and all who maintained them, with an in&s;uf|ferable in&s;olence and &s;currility. Di&s;appoint|ed of his expected preferment, and through|ly mortified that his merit had been &s;o long di&s;regarded, he withdrew into Germany. Thither he carried his old temper, attacking jews in &s;ynagogues, and papi&s;ts in ma&s;s-hou&s;es. But he was &s;oon glad to return into
<PB N="123" REF="125">England; where having lived out all his cre|dit, and become the je&s;t even of the &s;tage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Alchymi&s;t of Ben.

<P><PB N="124" REF="126">But to return: while Mr. Gilpin was en|gaged in &s;ettling his &s;chool, he was for &s;ome
<PB N="125" REF="127">time interrupted by a rebellion which broke out in the north. The popi&s;h party, which
<PB N="126" REF="128">had given &s;o much di&s;turbance to Elizabeth's reign, made at this time a fre&s;h effort. Two factious &s;pirits, the earls of We&s;tmorland,
<PB N="127" REF="129">and Northumberland, inflamed by the &s;edi|tious whi&s;pers of a Romi&s;h emi&s;&s;ary, were drawn from their allegiance. The watchful mini&s;try &s;oon &s;u&s;pected them; and the queen, with her u&s;ual fore&s;ight, appointing a &s;hort day for their appearance at court, obliged them, yet unprepared, to take arms.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin had ob&s;erved the fire gathering before the flame bar&s;t out; and knowing what zealots would &s;oon approach him, he thought it prudent to withdraw. Having given proper advice therefore to his ma&s;ters and &s;cholars, he took the opportunity to make a journey to Oxford.</P>
<P>The rebels in the mean time publi&s;h their manife&s;to, and appear in arms; di&s;playing in
<PB N="128" REF="130">their banners a chalice, and the five wounds of Chri&s;t, and enthu&s;ia&s;tically brandi&s;hing a cro&s;s before them. In this order they march to Bernard-ca&s;tle, which &s;urrenders to them. They next &s;urprize Durham; where they burn all the bibles they can find, and have ma&s;s &s;aid publicly in the cathedral. The country around felt their rage. Many of them ravaged as far as Houghton. Here they found much booty: the harve&s;t was ju&s;t over; the barns were full; the grounds well &s;tocked with fatted cattle. Every thing became their prey; and what was de&s;igned to &s;pread a winter's gladne&s;s through a coun|try, was in a moment wa&s;ted by the&s;e ra|vagers.</P>
<P>But them&s;elves &s;oon felt the con&s;ternation they occa&s;ioned. The approach of the earl of Su&s;&s;ex with a numerous army was now confirmed. Every rumour brought him nearer. Their fears proportionally increa&s;e, they mutiny, throw down their arms, and di&s;per&s;e. The country being generally loyal, many were taken, and impri&s;oned at Durham and Newca&s;tle, where &s;ir George Bowes was commi&s;&s;ioned to try them.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">Here Mr. Gilpin had an opportunity of &s;hewing his humanity. Sir George had re|ceived per&s;onal ill treatment from them; and the clamours of a plundered country demand|ed the utmo&s;t legal &s;everity: and indeed the utmo&s;t legal &s;everity was exerci&s;ed, to the great indignation of all, who were not wholly bent on revenge. This induced Mr. Gilpin to interpo&s;e. He repre&s;ented to the mar&s;hal the true &s;tate of the country, 'That, in ge|neral, the people were well affected; but being extremely ignorant, many of them had been &s;educed by idle &s;tories, which the re|bels had propagated, making them believe they took up arms for the queen's &s;ervice.' Per&s;uaded by what he &s;aid, or paying a de|ference to his character, the mar&s;hal grew more mild; and &s;hewed in&s;tances of mercy, not expected from him.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Gilpin lo&s;t one of the mo&s;t intimate friends he ever had, Dr. Pil|kington, bi&s;hop of Durham; a man much admired for his learning, but more e&s;teemed for the integrity of his life. He was bred at Cambridge, where he was many years ma&s;ter of St. John's college. Here he was fir&s;t taken
<PB N="130" REF="132">notice of for a freedom of &s;peech which drew upon him queen Mary's re&s;entment. But he had the good fortune to e&s;cape the in|qui&s;ition of tho&s;e times. In the &s;ucceeding reign he recommended him&s;elf by an expo&s;i|tion of the book of Haggai, or rather by an ingenious application of it to the reformation in religion then de&s;igning. He was after|wards introduced to the queen; and being found a man of true moderation, the reform|ing temper then looked for, and of abilities not unequal to the charge, he was promoted to the &s;ee of Durham. Having taken upon him this tru&s;t, he made it the endeavour of his life to fulfil it. He withdrew him&s;elf im|mediately from all &s;tate avocations, and court dependencies, in which indeed he had never been much involved, and applied him&s;elf wholly to the duties of his function; pro|moting religion rather by his own example, than by the u&s;e of proper di&s;cipline, in which he was thought too remi&s;s.&mdash;At Durham he became acquainted with Mr. Gilpin. Their minds, intent on the &s;ame pur&s;uits, ea&s;ily blended. It was a pure friend&s;hip, in which intere&s;t had no &s;hare; for the one had nothing
<PB N="131" REF="133">to a&s;k, the other had nothing to receive. When bu&s;ine&s;s did not require their being &s;eparate, they were generally together; as often at Mr. Gilpin's as at the bi&s;hop's. At the&s;e meetings they con&s;ulted many pious de&s;igns. Induced by Mr. Gilpin's example, the bi&s;hop founded a &s;chool at the place of his nativity in Lanca&s;hire; the &s;tatutes of which he brought to his friend to revi&s;e and correct.</P>

<P>MR. Gilpin's blamele&s;s life, his reputa|tion in the world, his piety, his learn|ing, and that uncommon regard for truth, which he had always di&s;covered, made it the de&s;ire of per&s;ons of all religious per&s;ua&s;ions to get him of their party, and have their cau&s;e credited by his authority.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;enters made early propo&s;als to him. The reformation had &s;carce obtained a legal &s;ettlement under Elizabeth, when that party appeared. Its origin was this.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h prote&s;tants, whom the Marian per&s;ecution had driven from home, flying in great bodies into Germany and Switzerland, &s;ettled at Frankfort, Stra&s;burgh, Arrow, Zu|ric, and Geneva. Of all the&s;e places Frank|fort afforded them the kinde&s;t reception. Here, by the favour of the magi&s;tracy, they obtained the joint u&s;e of a church with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants of France, to whom likewi&s;e Frankfort at that time afforded pro|tection. The&s;e were chiefly Calvini&s;ts. Re|ligious prejudices between both parties were
<PB N="133" REF="135">however here laid a&s;ide. Their circum&s;tan|ces as fellow-exiles in a foreign land, and fellow-&s;ufferers in a common cau&s;e, in&s;pired them with mutual tenderne&s;s: in one great animo&s;ity all others &s;ub&s;ided; and prote&s;tant and papi&s;t became the only di&s;tinction. In a word, the Engli&s;h thinking their own church now di&s;&s;olved, having no material objections, and being the le&s;&s;er body, for the &s;ake of peace and convenience, receded from their liturgy, and conformed to the French. Some authors indeed mention this as an impo&s;ed condition. Be it however as it will, the coalition was no &s;ooner known, than it gave the highe&s;t offence to many of the Engli&s;h &s;ettled in other parts. 'It was &s;candalous, they exclaimed, to &s;hew &s;o little regard to an e&s;tabli&s;hment which was formed with &s;o much wi&s;dom, was &s;o well calculated for all the ends of religion, and for which their poor brethren in England were at that time laying down their lives.' The truth of the ca&s;e was, the argument had been before mov|ed; and this was only the rekindling of that flame which John a La&s;co had formerly
<PB N="134" REF="136">rai&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>John a La&s;co was a native of Poland; from whence being driven on the account of his religion, he retired into England; where, by the favour of Edward the &s;ixth, he was allowed to open a church for the u&s;e of tho&s;e of his own per&s;ua&s;ion. But he made only a bad u&s;e of this indulgence; interfering very impertinently in the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;ies then on foot.</P></NOTE>. An oppo&s;ition &s;o very un&s;ea&s;onable produced, as &s;uch oppo&s;itions generally do the wor&s;t effects. Be&s;ides the &s;candal it every where gave, it engaged the Frankfort Eng|li&s;h in a formal defence of their proceedings; and their pa&s;&s;ions being excited, they began at length to maintain on principle, what they at fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;ed only for convenience. Ac|cordingly, when they came home, they re|vived the di&s;pute with bitterne&s;s enough; and became then as unrea&s;onable in mole&s;ting, as they had before been unrea&s;onably mole&s;ted. Subtil men will never be wanting, who have their &s;ini&s;ter ends to &s;erve by party-quarrels. Thus &s;ome ambitious &s;pirits among the di&s;|&s;enters, wanting to make them&s;elves con&s;i|derable, blew up the flame with great vehe|mence: 'It was as good, they exclaimed, not to begin a reformation, as not to go through with it&mdash;the church of England
<PB N="135" REF="137">was not half reformed&mdash;its doctrines indeed were tolerable, but its ceremonies and govern|ment were popi&s;h and unchri&s;tian&mdash;it was in vain to boa&s;t of having thrown off the Ro|mi&s;h yoke abroad, while the nation groaned under a lordly hierarchy at home&mdash;and for them&s;elves, as they had been &s;ufferers in the cau&s;e of religion, they thought it was but right they &s;hould be con&s;ulted about the &s;ettle|ment of it.' This imprudent language was a melancholy pre&s;age to all who had real chri&s;|tianity at heart. It was an&s;wered, 'That things were now legally &s;ettled&mdash;that what|ever could give ju&s;t offence to the &s;crupulous had been, it was thought, removed&mdash;that if they could not conform, a quiet non-confor|mity would be tolerated&mdash;and that the many inconveniencies attending even that change, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, made it very di&s;agreeable to think of another, which was not &s;o.' The lord Burleigh endeavoured to convince them how impo&s;&s;ible it was in things of this nature to give univer&s;al &s;atis|faction, by &s;hewing them that even among them&s;elves they could not agree upon the terms of an accommodation. And &s;ir Fran|cis
<PB N="136" REF="138">Wal&s;ingham propo&s;ed to them from the queen, that the three things in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church, to which they mo&s;t objected &s;hould be aboli&s;hed. But they an&s;wered lo&s;|tily, in the language of Mo&s;es; <Q>That not an hoof &s;hould be left behind.</Q> This irre|concileable temper gave great offence not only to the churchmen, but to the more &s;erious of their own per&s;ua&s;ion. The government from this time &s;lighting them, they appealed to the people; and by the popular artifice of decry|ing authority, they &s;oon became con&s;iderable.&mdash;Such were the beginnings of tho&s;e di&s;&s;en|tions which our prudent forefathers entailed on their po&s;terity!</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;enters having thus formed their party among the people, endeavoured to &s;trengthen it by &s;oliciting every where the mo&s;t creditable per&s;ons in favour of it. Very early applications, as was ob&s;erved, were made to Mr. Gilpin. His refu&s;al of the bi|&s;hopric of Carli&s;le had given them favourable &s;entiments of him, and great hopes that in his heart he had no di&s;like to their cau&s;e. But they &s;oon found their mi&s;take. He was wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with their proceedings.
<PB N="137" REF="139">Religious di&s;putes were in his opinion of &s;uch dreadful con&s;equence, that he always thought when true chri&s;tianity, under any form of church-government, was once e&s;tabli&s;hed in a country, that form ought not to be altered, unle&s;s blameable in &s;ome very material points. 'The reformation, he &s;aid, was ju&s;t: e&s;&s;en|tials were there concerned. But at pre&s;ent he &s;aw no ground for di&s;&s;atisfaction. The church of England, he thought, gave no rea&s;onable offence. Some things there might be in it, which had been perhaps as well avoided <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is probable he here means particularly the u&s;e of ve&s;tments, which gave a good deal of offence at that time.&mdash;Bi&s;hop Burnet, &s;peaking of &s;ome letters he &s;aw at Zuriek between Bullinger and &s;ome of the reformed bi&s;hops, has the following paragraph, which it will not be improper to quote at length, as it gives us a good idea of tho&s;e times.</P>
<Q>Mo&s;t of the&s;e letters contain only the general news, but &s;ome were more important, and relate to the di&s;|putes then on foot concerning the habits of the clergy, which gave the fir&s;t beginnings to our unhappy divi|&s;ions; and by the letters, of which I read the originals, it appears that the bi&s;hops pre&s;erved their antient ha|bits rather in compliance with the queen's inclinations, than out of any liking they had to them; &s;o far were they from liking them, that they plainly expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like of them. Jewel, in a letter bearing date the 8th of feb. 1566, wi&s;hes that the ve&s;tments, together
<PB N="138" REF="140">with all the other remains of popery, might be thrown both out of their churches, and out of the minds of the people, and laments the queen's fixedne&s;e to them: &s;o that &s;he would &s;uffer no change to be made.&mdash;And In january the &s;ame year, Sandys writes to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. "Contenditur de ve&s;tibus papi&s;ticis utendis ve! non utendis, dabit Deus his quoque finem." Di&s;|putes are now on foot concerning the popi&s;h ve&s;tments, whether they &s;hould be u&s;ed or not, but God will put an end to the&s;e things.&mdash;Horn bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter went further: for in a letter dated july 16, 1565, he writes of the act concerning the habits with great re|gret; and expre&s;&s;es &s;ome hopes that it might be repeal|ed next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, if the popi&s;h party did not hinder it; and he &s;eems to &s;tand in doubt whether he &s;hould conform him&s;elf to it or not, upon which he de&s;ires Bullinger's advice. And in many letters writ on that &s;ubject, it is a&s;&s;erted, that both Cranmer and Ridley intended to procure an act for aboli&s;hing the habits, and that they only defended their lawful|ne&s;s, but not their fitne&s;s, and therefore they blamed private per&s;ons that refu&s;ed to obey the laws.&mdash;Grindal in a letter dated the 27th of augu&s;t, 1566, writes, that all the bi&s;hops, who had been beyond the &s;ea, had at their return dealt with the queen to let the matter of the habits fall: but &s;he was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that though they had all endeavoured to divert her from pro&s;ecuting that matter, &s;he continued &s;till inflexible. This had made them re&s;olve to &s;ubmit to the laws, and to wait for a fit opportunity to rever&s;e them. He laments the ill effects of the oppo&s;ition that &s;ome had made to them, which had extremely irritated the queen's &s;pirit, &s;o that &s;he was now much more heated in tho&s;e matters than formerly; he al&s;o thanks Bullinger for the letter
<PB N="139" REF="141">he had writ, ju&s;tifying the lawful u&s;e of the habits, which, he &s;ays, had done great &s;ervice.&mdash;Cox, bi&s;hop of Ely, in one of his letters, laments the aver&s;ion that they found in the parliament to all the propo&s;itions that were made for the reformation of abu&s;es.&mdash;Jewel, in a letter dated the 22d of may 1559, writes, that the queen refu&s;ed to be called head of the church, and adds, that that title could not ju&s;tly be given to any mortal, it being due only to Chri&s;t; and that &s;uch titles had been &s;o much abu&s;ed by Antichri&s;t, that they ought not to be any longer continued.&mdash;On all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages I will make no reflections here: for I &s;et them down only to &s;hew what was the &s;en&s;e of our chief churchmen at that time concerning tho&s;e matters, which have &s;ince engaged us in &s;uch warm and angry di&s;putes; and this may be no incon&s;iderable in&s;truction to one that intends to write the hi&s;tory of that time. <BIBL>Dr. Burnet's travels, let. 1.</BIBL></Q>

<PB N="138" REF="140">for &s;uch trifles, he thought, was quite unchri&s;tian.'&mdash;And indeed what appeared to
<PB N="139" REF="141">him chiefly blameable in the di&s;&s;enters, was, that heat of temper with which they propa|gated their opinions, and treated tho&s;e who differed from them. Neither epi&s;copal nor pre&s;byterian government, nor caps, nor fur|plices, nor any external things, were matters with him half &s;o intere&s;ting, as peace and charity among chri&s;tians: and this was his con&s;tant topic in all his occa&s;ional conver&s;a|tions with that party.</P>
<P>Such however was the opinion they enter|tained of him, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ca|&s;ual intimations of his di&s;like to them, they
<PB N="140" REF="142">&s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their endeavours to gain him to their &s;ide. The chief of them failed not to &s;et before him what they had to &s;ay of mo&s;t weight again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed di&s;cipline; and a per&s;on of e&s;teemed abilities among them came on purpo&s;e from Cambridge to di&s;cour&s;e with him upon the be&s;t form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. But this agent did his cau&s;e little credit. With no great learning he had an in&s;upportable vanity; and &s;eemed to take it for granted, that him&s;elf and Calvin were the two greate&s;t men in the world. His di&s;|cour&s;e had nothing of argument in it; an in|decent invective again&s;t epi&s;copacy was the &s;um of it. He was &s;o full of him&s;elf, that Mr. Gilpin thought it to no purpo&s;e to rea&s;on with him, and therefore avoided whatever could lead them into a di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Some time after Mr. Gilpin heard, that his late vi&s;itant had reported him to have affirm|ed, &s;peaking about the primitive times, that 'the virtues of the moderns were not equal even to the infirmities of the fathers.' He &s;aid indeed he remembered &s;ome &s;uch thing coming from him; but not in the &s;erious manner in which it was repre&s;ented. His
<PB N="141" REF="143">adver&s;ary had been decrying the fathers great|ly, declaring there were men in this age much their &s;uperiors, plainly intimating whom he principally intended. Such arrogance, Mr. Gilpin &s;aid, he was de&s;irous to mortify; and meant it of &s;uch moderns as him, when he a&s;&s;erted that their virtues were not equal to the infirmities of the fathers.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s the di&s;&s;enters had met with in their private applications, encouraged them to try what farther might be had by a public attack on the national church. Their great champion was Dr. Cartwright, who wrote with much bitterne&s;s again&s;t it. His book was immediately di&s;per&s;ed over the nation, re|ceived by the party with loud acclamations, and every where con&s;idered by them as un|an&s;werable.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after it was publi&s;hed, it was zealou&s;ly put into Mr. Gilpin's hands. The gentleman who &s;ent it, one Dr. Birch, a warm friend to the principles advanced in it, de&s;ired he would read it over carefully, and commu|nicate to him his remarks. But very impa|tient for them, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger before Mr. Gilpin had read the book half through.

<P>Though Mr. Gilpin was thus greatly di&s;|&s;atisfied with the di&s;orderly zeal which the more violent of the di&s;&s;enters expre&s;&s;ed, at|tended, as he ob&s;erved it was, with &s;uch fatal con&s;equences, he confined however his di&s;like to their errors; to their per&s;ons he bore not the lea&s;t ill-will. Nay, one of the mo&s;t intimate friends he ever had was Mr. Lever, a mini&s;ter of their per&s;ua&s;ion, and a &s;ufferer in their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This gentleman had been head of a college in Cambridge, and afterwards prebendary of
<PB N="143" REF="145">Durham, and ma&s;ter of Sherborn-ho&s;pital. He was a man of good parts, con&s;iderable learning, and very exemplary piety; and had been e&s;teemed in king Edward's time an emi|nent and bold preacher. During the &s;ucceed|ing confu&s;ion he &s;ettled at Arrow in Switzer|land, where he was teacher to a congregation of Engli&s;h exiles. Here he became a fa|vourer of Calvin's opinions; and at his return home was con&s;idered as one of the principal of the di&s;&s;enting party. The very great in|di&s;cretions, already mentioned, of a few vio|lent men, &s;oon made that whole party ob|noxious to the government; to which no|thing perhaps more contributed than the &s;e|ditious application of that doctrine to Eliza|beth, which had been formerly propagated again&s;t female government by Knox and Good|man in the reign of her &s;i&s;ter. This was touching that jealous queen in a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part; and induced her, perhaps too rigorou&s;ly, though &s;he was really ill u&s;ed, to pre&s;s unifor|mity.&mdash;Among others Mr. Lever &s;uffered: he was convened before the archbi&s;hop of York, and deprived of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre|ferment. Many of the cooler churchmen
<PB N="144" REF="146">thought him hardly dealt with, as he was really a moderate man, and not forward in oppo&s;ing the received opinions.</P>
<P>Mr. Gilpin was among tho&s;e who pitied his treatment: nor did he &s;cruple to expre&s;s his u&s;ual regard for him, though it was not a thing the mo&s;t agreeable to his &s;uperibrs. But he had too much honour to &s;acrifice friend&s;hip to popular prejudice; and thought, that they, who agreed in e&s;&s;entials, &s;hould not be e&s;tranged from each other for their dif|ferent &s;entiments on points of le&s;s impor|tance.</P>
<P>As Mr. Gilpin was thus &s;olicited on one hand by the di&s;&s;enters, &s;o was he on the other by the papi&s;ts. It had long been a mortifi|cation to all the well-meaning of that per|&s;ua&s;ion, that &s;o good a man had left their communion; and no methods were left un|tried to bring him back. But his change had been a work of too much caution to be re|pented of: &s;o that all their endeavours prov|ed, as it was ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e they would, ineffectual.</P>
<P>A letter of his, written upon an occa&s;ion of this kind, may here not improperly be
<PB N="145" REF="147">in&s;erted, to &s;hew how well &s;atisfied he was at this time with having left the church of Rome; and how unlikely it was that he &s;hould ever again become a member of it. I wi&s;h I could give this letter in its original &s;implicity; but the manu&s;cript is &s;o mutilat|ed, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to tran&s;cribe a fair copy from it. The bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter however hath given a Latin tran&s;lation of it, from which I &s;hall take as much of it as is worth pre&s;erving. It was writ in an&s;wer to a long letter from one Mr. Gelthorpe, a rela|tion of Mr. Gilpin, who being a warm pa|pi&s;t him&s;elf, was very unea&s;y that his kin&s;|man and friend &s;hould be a prote&s;tant. He failed not therefore to &s;ugge&s;t to him what he could think of in favour of popery, and of the danger of apo&s;tatizing, concluding his letter thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&mdash;Now, I be&s;eech you, remember what God hath called you to; and beware of pa&s;&s;ionate doings. I know you have &s;uffered under great &s;landers and evil re|ports; yet you may, by God's grace, bridle all affections, and be an upright man. The
<PB N="146" REF="148">port of you is great at London, and in all other places; &s;o that in my opinion you &s;hall in the&s;e days, even &s;hortly, either do much good, leaning to the truth; or el&s;e (which I pray God turn away from us!) you &s;hall do as much evil to the church as ever Arius did.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>To this letter the following was Mr. Gil|pin's an&s;wer.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I received your letter when I had very little time to an&s;wer it, as the bearer can inform you. I did not care however to &s;end him back without &s;ome return, though in the latter part of your letter you &s;ay enough to tempt me to do &s;o. For what encouragement have I to write, when you tell me, you are predetermined not to be per&s;uaded? It could not but damp the pro|phet's zeal, when he cried out, 'Hear the word of the Lord;' to be an&s;wered by a &s;tubborn people, 'We will not hear.'&mdash;But let us leave events to God, who can &s;often the heart of man, and give &s;en&s;e to the deaf adder, which &s;hutteth her ears.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">You look back, you &s;ay, upon pa&s;t ages. But how far? If you would carry your view as high as Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles; nay, only as high as the primitive times, and examine them without prejudice; you could not but &s;ee a &s;trange alteration of things, and acknowledge that a thou&s;and errors and ab&s;urdities have crept into the church while men &s;lept.</P>
<P>It grieves me to hear you talk of your concern for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of abbies and mona&s;teries: numbers even of your own communion have confe&s;&s;ed, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;tand any longer. They were grown up into &s;uch mon&s;trous &s;anctuaries for all kinds of vice, that their cry, no doubt, like that of Sodom, a&s;cend|ed into the ears of God. Be&s;ides, con&s;ider what pe&s;ts they were to all good learning and religion; how they preyed upon all the rectories in the kingdom; ama&s;&s;ing to them|&s;elves, for the &s;upport of their vices, that wealth which was meant by pious founders for the maintenance of indu&s;trious clergy|men.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="150">He that cometh to God, you &s;ay, mu&s;t believe. Without doubt: but I would have you con&s;ider, that religious faith can have no foundation but the word of God. He who&s;e creed is founded upon bulls, in|dulgences, and &s;uch trumpery, can have no true faith. All the&s;e things will vani&s;h, where the word of God hath efficacy.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you cannot &s;ee any thing in the Romi&s;h church contrary to the go&s;pel: I &s;hould think, if you looked narrowly into it, you might &s;ee the go&s;pel intirely reject|ed; and in its room legends, traditions, and a thou&s;and other ab&s;urdities introduced.&mdash;But this is an exten&s;ive &s;ubject, and I have little lei&s;ure. Some other time prp|bably I may write more largely upon the&s;e points. May God in the mean time open your eyes to &s;ee "the abominations of the city upon &s;even hills." Rev. 17. Con&s;ult St. Jerome upon this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>You u&s;e the phra&s;e, "If you &s;hould now begin to drink of another cup:" whereas you never drank of any cup at all. How can you defend, I would gladly know, this &s;ingle corruption; or reconcile it with that
<PB N="149" REF="151">expre&s;s command of Chri&s;t, "Drink ye all of this;" I am &s;ure, if you can defend it, it was more than any of your learned doc|tors at Louvain could do, as I my&s;elf can witne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to our being called heretics, and avoid|ed by you, we are extremely indifferent: we appeal from your uncharitable cen&s;ures to Almighty God; and &s;ay with St. Paul, "we little e&s;teem to be judged of you, it is the Lord who judgeth us."</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, it is dangerous to hear us. So &s;aid the per&s;ecutors of St. Stephen, and &s;topped their ears. So likewi&s;e Amaziah behaved to the prophet Amos. David like|wi&s;e &s;peaks of &s;uch men, comparing them "to the deaf adder, which &s;toppeth her ears," And we have in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind of bigotry in the writings of the evangeli&s;ts; where we often read of men, who&s;e minds "the god of this world hath blinded."</P>
<P>As for the terrible threatnings of your bi&s;hop, we are under no apprehen&s;ion from them. They are calculated only for the nur&s;ery. Era&s;mus properly calls them bruta fulmina. If the pope and his cardi|nals,
<PB N="150" REF="152">who cur&s;e us with &s;o much bitterne&s;s, were like Peter and Paul; if they di&s;cover|ed that fervent charity, that exten&s;ive bene|volence, and noble zeal in their ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, which di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e apo&s;tles, then were there &s;ome rea&s;on to dread their cen&s;ures: but alas! they have changed the humility of Peter into the pride of Lu|cifer; the labours and poverty of apo&s;tles into the &s;loth and luxury of ea&s;tern mo|narchs.</P>
<P>I am far from thinking there is no dif|ference between con&s;ub&s;tantiality and tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation. The former undoubtedly hath many texts of &s;cripture for its &s;up|port; the latter certainly none: nay, it hath &s;o confounded many of its mo&s;t zealous a&s;|&s;ertors, Scotus, Occam, Biel, and others, that it is plain how perplexed they are to get over the many difficulties that ari&s;e from it. Indeed Scotus thought, as bi&s;hop Tun|&s;tal would ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that the church had better make u&s;e of &s;ome le&s;s laboured expo&s;ition of tho&s;e words in &s;crip|ture. And the good bi&s;hop him&s;elf like|wi&s;e, though he would have men &s;peak
<PB N="151" REF="153">reverently of the &s;acrament, as the primi|tive church did, yet always &s;aid that tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation might well have been let alone. As to what Mr. Ched&s;ey &s;aid, "That the catholics would do well to give way in the article of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation," I cannot &s;ay I heard him &s;peak the words my&s;elf, but I had them from a per&s;on who did.</P>
<P>I am far from agreeing with you, that the lives of &s;o many vicious popes &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. If the vices of churchmen &s;hould thus be concealed, I know not how you will defend Chri&s;t for rebuking the phari&s;ees, who were the holy fathers of tho&s;e times: or the prophet I&s;aiah, who is for having good and evil di&s;|tingui&s;hed; and denounces a cur&s;e upon tho&s;e, "who call him holy that is not holy:" or St. Bernard likewi&s;e, who &s;cruples not to call &s;ome wicked prie&s;ts in his time the mini&s;ters of Antichri&s;t. Such examples may excu&s;e us.</P>
<P>Five &s;acraments, you &s;ay, are rejected by us. You mi&s;take: we u&s;e them &s;till as the &s;cripture authorizes. Nay, even to the
<PB N="152" REF="154">name of &s;acrament we have no objection; only &s;uffer us to give our own explanation of it. I find wa&s;hing of feet, and many other things of the &s;ame kind, are called &s;acraments by &s;ome old writers; but the fathers, and &s;ome of the be&s;t of the &s;chool|men, are of opinion, that only bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper can properly be called &s;a|craments.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed to hear you e&s;tabli&s;h on a few ea&s;y pa&s;&s;ages in St. Paul the &s;everal ridi|culous ceremonies of the ma&s;s: &s;urely you cannot be ignorant, that mo&s;t of them were invented long afterwards by the bi&s;hops of Rome.&mdash;How much you ob&s;erve St. Paul upon other occa&s;ions, is evident from your &s;trange abu&s;e of the in&s;titution of bread and wine. There it &s;ignifies nothing what the apo&s;tle &s;ays: tradition is the better authority.</P>
<P>You tell me you can prove the u&s;e of prayers for the dead from &s;cripture. I know you mean the book of Maccabees. But our church follows the opinion of the fathers in &s;aying, that the&s;e books are pro|fitable for manners, but not to be u&s;ed in e&s;tabli&s;hing doctrines.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155">St. Au&s;tin, you &s;ay, doubts whether there be not a purgatory. And &s;o becau&s;e he doubts it, the church of Rome hath e&s;tabli&s;hed it as an article of faith. Now I think if &s;he had rea&s;oned right from the &s;aint's doubts, &s;he &s;hould at lea&s;t have left it indifferent. Faith, you know St. James &s;ays, ought not to waver. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, who was a diligent &s;earcher into antiquity, &s;ays, that among the antients there is little or no mention made of purgatory. For my&s;elf, I am apt to think, it was fir&s;t introduced by that grand popi&s;h traffick of indulgencies.</P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay about the invocation of &s;aints, St. Au&s;tin, you know, him&s;elf exhorteth his readers not to ground their faith upon his writings, but on the &s;crip|tures. And indeed, I think, there is no|thing in the whole word of God more plainly declared to us than this, that God alone mu&s;t be the object of our adoration. "How &s;hall they call on him, &s;aith St. Paul, in whom they have not believed?" If we believe in one God only, why &s;hould, we pray to any more? The popi&s;h di&s;tinction
<PB N="154" REF="156">between invocation, and advocation, is poor &s;ophi&s;try. As we are told, we mu&s;t pray only to one God; &s;o we read likewi&s;e of only one advocate with the father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous.&mdash;You &s;ay you believe in the communion of &s;aints, and infer, that no communion with them can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, un|le&s;s we pray to them: but our church un|der&s;tands quite another thing by the com|munion of &s;aints: for the word &s;aint is a common &s;cripture epithet for a good chri&s;|tian; nor doth it once &s;ignify, in either te&s;tament, as far as I can remember, a de|parted &s;oul: nay, &s;ometimes the words are very expre&s;s, as in the &s;ixteenth p&s;alm, "To the &s;aints which be on earth." If any man ever had a communion with the &s;aints in heaven, &s;urely David had it: but he never &s;peaks of any communion with which he was acquainted, but with the &s;aints on earth.&mdash;And thus likewi&s;e St. John &s;peaks, "What we have &s;een and known, that de|clare we unto you, that you may have fel|low&s;hip, or communion, with us, and that our communion may be with God, and with his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t." 1 John, i. 3.
<PB N="155" REF="157">All the members of the church of Chri&s;t have communion among them&s;elves: which communion con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in mutual prayers and preaching. Secondly, the church of Chri&s;t hath communion with the father and the &s;on, or with the father through the &s;on. That &s;uch communion as this exi&s;ts, we have good authority; but none at all for a belief in a communion with departed &s;ouls: the&s;e, as I ob&s;erved be|fore, are never in &s;cripture called &s;aints; but generally de&s;cribed by &s;ome &s;uch peri|phra&s;is, as, "The congregation of the fir&s;t|born in heaven;" or, "the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect." In the next world probably with the&s;e likewi&s;e we may have communion; but they who expect it in this, mu&s;t either bring &s;cripture for what they &s;ay, or come under our Saviour's cen&s;ure, "In vain do ye wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men." Matt. xv. 9.&mdash;Indeed by the cu&s;|tom of late ages departed &s;ouls are called &s;aints: but I hope I need not inform you that the holy &s;cripture is a more proper directory, than the cu&s;tom of any age.&mdash;But
<PB N="156" REF="158">it is needle&s;s to di&s;pute upon this point, becau&s;e even the mo&s;t zealous defenders of it acknowledge it to be a thing indif|ferent, whether we pray immediately to God, or through the mediation of &s;aints. And if it be a thing indifferent, &s;ure a wi&s;e man knows what to do. Who does not expect purer water at the fountain|head, than at the little &s;treams that run from it?</P>
<P>As for what you &s;ay about images, and fa&s;ting (the proper u&s;e of which latter God forbid that I &s;hould &s;ay any thing again&s;t) together with your arguments in favour of reliques, and exorci&s;ms, I could without any &s;ort of difficulty reply to them: but at this time you really mu&s;t excu&s;e me: it is not an apology of cour&s;e when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I am now extreme|ly bu&s;y. You will the more ea&s;ily believe me, when I tell you that I am at pre&s;ent without a curate; and that I am likewi&s;e a good deal out of order, and hardly able to undergo the nece&s;&s;ary fatigues of my office.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159">As to your not chu&s;ing to come to Houghton on a &s;unday, for fear of offend|ing my people, to &s;ay the truth, except you will come to church, which I think you might do very well, I &s;hould not much de&s;ire to &s;ee you on that day; for country people are &s;trangely given to copy a bad example; and will unlearn more in a day, than they have been learning for a month.&mdash;You mu&s;t excu&s;e my freedom: you know my heart; and how gladly I would have it to &s;ay, "Of tho&s;e whom thou gave&s;t me have I lo&s;t none." But on any other day, or if you will come on &s;unday night, and &s;tay a week with me, I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you. We may then talk over the&s;e things with more freedom: and though, as I ob&s;erved before, the latter part of your letter gives me no great encouragement, yet I will endeavour to have a better hope of you, than you have of your&s;elf. St. Paul, in the early part of his life, was fully per&s;uaded that he &s;hould die a pha|ri&s;ee, and an enemy to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: but there was a re&s;erve of mercy in &s;tore for him; and through God's grace his
<PB N="158" REF="160">heart became &s;o changed, that he &s;uffered per&s;ecution him&s;elf for that name, which it had been before his ambition to per&s;e|cute.</P>
<P>May the great God of heaven make you an object of the &s;ame mercy, and by the &s;pirit of knowledge lead your mind into all truth. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE public generally &s;ees us in di&s;gui&s;e: the ca&s;e is, we ordinarily pay a greater deference to the world's opinion, than to our own con&s;ciences. Hence a man's real merit is very improperly e&s;timated from the more expo&s;ed part of his behaviour.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Gilpin's life, already collected, are chiefly of a public nature; if we may thus call any action of a life &s;o pri|vate. To place his merit therefore in its true&s;t light, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to accompany him in his retirement, and take a view of his ordinary behaviour, from which all re&s;traint was taken off. Hence we &s;hall have the fulle&s;t proof of what he truly was, upon what principles he acted, and that the virtue he practi&s;ed was not the effect of any deference to the world's opinion, but of inward con|viction, and a &s;incere de&s;ire to act agreeably to the will of his creator.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t took upon him the care of a pari&s;h, he laid it down as a maxim, to do all the good in his power there. And in|deed
<PB N="160" REF="162">his whole conduct was only one &s;trait line drawn to this point.</P>
<P>He &s;et him&s;elf to con&s;ider how he might be&s;t perform the charge intru&s;ted to him. The pa&s;toral care he &s;aw was much neglect|ed: the greater part of the clergy, he could not but ob&s;erve, were &s;candalou&s;ly negligent of it, accepting livings only with &s;ecular views; and even they, who &s;eemed de&s;irous of being accounted &s;erious in the di&s;charge of their mini&s;try, too often, he thought, con|&s;idered it in a light widely different from its true one. Some, he ob&s;erved, made it con&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting the rights of the church, and the dignity of their function; others, in a &s;tre|nuous oppo&s;ition to the prevailing &s;ectaries, and a zealous attachment to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church-government; a third &s;ort in examin|ing the &s;peculative points, and my&s;tical parts of religion: none of them in the mean time con&s;idering either in what the true dignity of the mini&s;terial character con&s;i&s;ted; or the only end for which church-government was at all e&s;tabli&s;hed; or the practical influence, which can alone make &s;peculative points worth our attention.&mdash;All this he ob&s;erved,
<PB N="161" REF="163">with concern ob&s;erved, re&s;olving to pur&s;ue a different path, and to follow the laudable ex|ample of tho&s;e few, who made the pa&s;toral care to con&s;i&s;t in a &s;trenuous endeavour to a|mend the lives of tho&s;e they were concerned with, and to promote their true&s;t happine&s;s both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The &s;trange di&s;order of that part of the country where his lot fell, hath already been ob&s;erved. The extreme of ignorance, and of cour&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition, was its characteri&s;|tic. The great care of Parker, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, his frequent and &s;trict vi&s;itations, his &s;evere inquiries into the mini&s;try of the clergy, and manners of the laity, had made a very vi&s;ible alteration for the better in the &s;outhern parts of England: but in the north, reformation went on but &s;luggi&s;hly. The in|dolent archbi&s;hop of York &s;lept over his pro|vince. In what great di&s;order the good bi|&s;hop Grindal found it, upon his tran&s;lation thither, in the year 1570, appears from his epi&s;copal injunctions, among which are the&s;e very extraordinary ones, That no pedlar &s;hould be admitted to &s;ell his wares in the church|porch in time of &s;ervice&mdash;That pari&s;h-clerks
<PB N="162" REF="164">&s;hould be able to read&mdash;That no lords of mi&s;|rule, or &s;ummer lords and ladies, or any di&s;|gui&s;ed per&s;ons, morrice-dancers, or others, &s;hould come irreverently into the church, or play any un&s;eemly parts with &s;coffs, je&s;ts, wanton ge&s;tures, or ribald talk, in the time of divine &s;ervice.&mdash;From the&s;e things we may conceive the &s;tate of the pari&s;h of Houghton, when Mr. Gilpin came there <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One would imagine it was in this part of the coun|try where bi&s;hop Latimer was travelling, when he gives us the following account.&mdash; <Q>I &s;ent word over-night to a town, that I would preach there in the morning; becau&s;e it was a holy-day. When I came to the church, where I thought I &s;hould have found a great company, the door was fa&s;t locked. I tarried half an hour. At la&s;t one of the pari&s;h comes to me, and &s;ays, "Sir, this is a bu&s;y day with us; we cannot hear you: it is Robin Hood's day: the pari&s;h is gone abroad to gather for Robin Hood; I pray you hinder them not." So I was fain to give place to Robin Hood.
<BIBL>Sermon vi. before the king.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t &s;uch ignorance to introduce a knowledge of religion was a laborious work; as difficult as a fir&s;t plantation of the go&s;pel. There was the &s;ame building to rai&s;e, and as much rubbi&s;h to clear away; for no preju|dices could be &s;tronger, and more alien to chri&s;tianity, than tho&s;e he had to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">He &s;et out with making it his endeavour to gain the affection of his pari&s;hioners. Many of his papers &s;hew how material a point he con&s;idered this. To &s;ucceed in it however he u&s;ed no &s;ervile compliances: he would have his means good, as well as his end. His behaviour was free without levity, obliging without meanne&s;s, in&s;inuating with|out art: he conde&s;cended to the weak, bore with the pa&s;&s;ionate, complied with the &s;cru|pulous: in a truly apo&s;tolic manner, he <Q>be|came all things to all men.</Q> By the&s;e means he gained mightily upon his neighbours, and convinced them how heartily he was their friend.</P>
<P>To this humanity and courte&s;y he added an unwearied application to the duties of his function. He was not &s;atisfied with the ad|vice he gave in public, but u&s;ed to in&s;truct in private; and brought his pari&s;hioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a mo&s;t engaging manner towards tho&s;e, whom he thought well-di&s;po&s;ed: nay his very reproof was &s;o conducted, that it &s;eldom gave offence; the becoming gentlene&s;s with which it was urged made it always appear
<PB N="164" REF="166">the effect of friend&s;hip. Thus laying him|&s;elf out in admoni&s;hing the vicious, and en|couraging the well-intentioned, in a few years he made a greater change in his neighbour|hood, than could well have been imagined&mdash;a remarkable in&s;tance, what reformation a &s;ingle man may effect, when he hath it ear|ne&s;tly at heart!</P>
<P>But his hopes were not &s;o much in the pre&s;ent generation, as in the &s;ucceeding. It was an ea&s;ier ta&s;k, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to form the young to vir|tue, than to amend the bad habits of the old. He laid out much of his time therefore in an endeavour to improve the minds of the younger part of his pari&s;h. Nor did he only take notice of tho&s;e within his &s;chool, but in general extended his care through the whole place: &s;uffering none to grow up in an ig|norance of their duty; but pre&s;&s;ing it as the wi&s;e&s;t part to mix religion with their labour, and amid&s;t the cares of this life to have a con|&s;tant eye upon the next.</P>
<P>Nor did he omit whatever be&s;ides might be of &s;ervice to his pari&s;hioners.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167">He was very affiduous in preventing all law-&s;uits among them. His hall is &s;aid to have been often thronged with people who came to him about their differences. He was not indeed much acquainted with law, but he could decide equitably, and that &s;atisfied: nor could his &s;overeign's commi&s;&s;ion have given him more weight than his own character gave him.</P>
<P>He had a ju&s;t concern for all under afflic|tion; and was a much readier vi&s;itant at the hou&s;e of mourning than at that of fea&s;ting. He had conver&s;ed &s;o much in the world, that he knew how to apply him&s;elf to the mo&s;t different tempers; and his large fund of read|ing and experience always furni&s;hed &s;ome|thing that would properly affect them. Hence he was con&s;idered as a good angel by all in di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;When the infirmities of age came upon him, and he grew le&s;s able to endure exerci&s;e, it was his cu&s;tom to write letters of con&s;olation to &s;uch as were in affliction <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following letter of this kind the reader may perhaps think worth his peru&s;al.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>After my mo&s;t due commendations, I be&s;eech you, gentle Mrs. Carr, diligently to call to mind how mer|cifully
<PB N="166" REF="168">God hath dealt with you in many re&s;pects. He hath given you a gentleman of wor&s;hip to be your hu&s;|band; one that I know loveth you dearly, as a chri&s;|tian man &s;hould love his wife. And by him God hath ble&s;&s;ed you with a goodly family of children, which both you and your hu&s;band mu&s;t take to be the favour|able and free gift of God.&mdash;But, good Mrs. Carr, you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that both that gift of God, and all others, and we our&s;elves are in his hands: he takes what he will, whom he will, and when he will; and whom&s;oever he taketh, in youth or in age, we mu&s;t fully per&s;uade our&s;elves, that he ordereth all things for the be&s;t. We may not murmur, or think much at any of his doings; but mu&s;t learn to &s;peak from our hearts the petition of the Lord's prayer, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." It is unto this holy obedience that St. Peter calleth all chri&s;tians, &s;aying, "Humble your&s;elves under the mighty hand of God.&mdash;This godly &s;ubmiffion did cau&s;e the holy patriarch Job, when it plea&s;ed God to take from him not only one, but all his children, &s;even brethren and &s;i&s;ters, upon one day, never to grieve him&s;elf with what God had done, but meekly to &s;ay, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord."&mdash;And here I would have you, good Mrs. Carr, to con&s;ider, how &s;mall cau&s;e you have to mourn, or fall into a deep &s;orrow, in compari&s;on of the holy patriarch. God hath taken from you only one young daughter, and hath left you a goodly family of children, which, I tru&s;t, with good education, will prove a ble&s;&s;ed comfort to you.&mdash;This example of Job and other examples in holy &s;cripture, being written
<PB N="167" REF="169">(as the apo&s;tle &s;aith) for our admonition, I mu&s;t needs declare you to be worthy of great blame, if you con|tinue any &s;pace in &s;uch great &s;orrow and heavine&s;s, as I hear you take for your young daughter. St. Peter &s;aith, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;uffered for us mo&s;t cruel tor|ments, and la&s;t of all a mo&s;t cruel death, "to leave us an example, that all that believe in him &s;hould follow his ble&s;&s;ed &s;teps:" that is, to bear his cro&s;s, to be armed with all patience, when&s;oever we lo&s;e any thing that we love in this world. And the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aith, "Seeing Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered for us in his body, all you that are chri&s;tians mu&s;t be armed with the &s;ame thought."&mdash;Furthermore the &s;cripture &s;aith, that unto us it is given not only to believe in Chri&s;t, but al&s;o to &s;uffer for his &s;ake. And St. Paul, in the 8th to the Romans, hath a mo&s;t comfortable &s;entence to all that will learn to &s;uffer with him; and a mo&s;t fearful &s;entence to all tho&s;e that refu&s;e to &s;uffer with him, and to bear his cro&s;s: "The &s;pirit, &s;aith he, beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the child|ren of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and fellow-heirs with Chri&s;t;" (it followeth) "if &s;o be that we &s;uffer together with him, that we may al&s;o be glorified with him." And St. Paul, in the fir&s;t chapter of the &s;econd to the Corinthians, &s;aith to all the faithful, "As ye are companions of tho&s;e things, which Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered, &s;o &s;hall ye be companions of his con&s;olations."&mdash;All the&s;e things con&s;idered, I doubt not, good Mr. Carr, but that you will arm your&s;elf with patience, and bear Chri&s;t's cro&s;s, learning to &s;uffer for his &s;ake, and that, were it a greater lo&s;s than you have, God be prai&s;ed, as yet &s;u&s;tained.&mdash;Let your faith overcome your &s;orrow. St. Paul writing to the The&s;&s;alonians concerning the dead
<PB N="168" REF="170">(who, he &s;aith, have but fallen a&s;leep) forbiddeth them not to mourn, but utterly forbiddeth them to mourn like gentiles, and infidels, who have no hope in Chri&s;t. And the wi&s;e man (Ecclus. xxii.) doth exhort us to mourn over the dead, &s;o it be but for a little &s;pace: "Weep, &s;aith he, for the dead, but only for a little time, becau&s;e they are gone to their re&s;t." So you &s;ee there is an unrea&s;onable mourning of them that want faith; and there is al&s;o a temperate and lawful mourning of them that have a &s;tedfa&s;t belief in Chri&s;t, and his promi&s;es, "which (St. John &s;aith) overcometh all the temptations (that is, the troubles) of the world." I tru&s;t verily, good Mrs. Carr, that your mourning being temperate will &s;hew it&s;elf to be a faithful, not a faithle&s;s mourning; which latter I pray almighty God to keep from you.&mdash;But I fear to be tedious. I tru&s;t one day I &s;hall be able to come unto you my&s;elf. In the mean &s;pace, and evermore, I &s;hall pray that the God of all con&s;olation may comfort you in all your troubles. Your loving friend in Chri&s;t,</P>

<P><PB N="166" REF="168">He u&s;ed to interpo&s;e likewi&s;e in all acts of oppre&s;&s;ion; and his authority was &s;uch, that it generally put a &s;top to them.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">A per&s;on again&s;t whom the country at that time exclaimed very much, was one Mr.
<PB N="168" REF="170">Barns, a near relation, if not a brother of Dr. Barns, bi&s;hop of Durham, who rai&s;ed him through &s;ome inferior po&s;ts to the chan|cellor&s;hip of his dioce&s;e. This man, though at the head of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, would have been a &s;candal to the meane&s;t office. He was indeed the tyrant of the country, con&s;idering his power only as the means of gratifying his vicious inclinations: among which, as avarice bore a ruling part, oppre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="169" REF="171">was its natural effect. Between this man and Mr. Gilpin there was a perpetual oppo|&s;ition for many years; the latter endeavour|ing always to counteract the former, and to be the redre&s;&s;er of tho&s;e injuries, of which he was the author. Several traces of the&s;e con|te&s;ts &s;till remain among Mr. Gilpin's papers; from which it appears what a con&s;tant check upon his de&s;igns Mr. Barns found him; though he was never treated by him with any bitterne&s;s, but always in a mild, and even affectionate manner. <Q>It will be but a very few years</Q> Mr. Gilpin tells him, conclud|ing a letter written in favour of three orphans, whom Mr. Barns had defrauded of their pa|trimony) <Q>before you and I mu&s;t give up our great accounts. I pray God give us both the grace to have them in a con&s;tant readine&s;s. And may you take what I have written in as friendly a manner as it is meant. My daily prayers are made for you to almighty God, whom I be&s;eech evermore to pre&s;erve you.</Q> By being thus at all times ready to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the injured, he &s;hewed not only hu|manity, but re&s;olution likewi&s;e; without
<PB N="170" REF="172">which our concern for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others will often go but a very little way towards their relief. For as compa&s;&s;ion is only in|&s;tinct, con&s;ulting in its operations perhaps our own relief chiefly; of cour&s;e he who is governed by no &s;teadier principle, will de&s;ert the benevolent part, when fatigue or danger throw difficulties in his way. But he who can exert re&s;olution in the cau&s;e of the op|pre&s;&s;ed, is a friend indeed: he is influenced by a fixed principle, the effect of rational con&s;ideration: this enables him to overcome the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which prompt mo&s;t men, like the timorous herd, to &s;hun the unfortunate. The humane part Mr. Gilpin acted, no doubt, often expo&s;ed him to inconveniencies; but he made little account of them, ju&s;tly reflecting, that upon the whole what was right was be&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus he lived in his pari&s;h, careful only to di&s;charge his duty: no fatigue or difficulty could excu&s;e him to him&s;elf for the omi&s;&s;ion, of any part of it: the moral improvement of his people was his principal endeavour, and the &s;ucce&s;s of this endeavour his princi|pal happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">Notwith&s;tanding however all this painful indu&s;try, and the large &s;cope it had in &s;o ex|tended a pari&s;h, he thought the &s;phere of his benevolence yet too confined. It grieved him extremely to &s;ee every where in the pa|ri&s;hes around him &s;o much ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition; occa&s;ioned by the very great neg|lect of the pa&s;toral care in the clergy of tho&s;e parts. How ill &s;upplied the northern churches at this time were, hath already been ob&s;erved; and will &s;till appear in a &s;tronger light, if we compare the &s;tate of the&s;e churches with that of tho&s;e in the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, which were univer&s;ally allowed to have been le&s;s neglected. Of one dioce&s;e, that of Ely, where the clergy do not appear to have been uncommonly remi&s;s, we have a curious account &s;till pre&s;erved: it contained one hun|dred and fifty-&s;ix pari&s;hes; of which forty-&s;even had no mini&s;ters at all, fifty-&s;even were in the bands of carele&s;s non-re&s;idents, and only the remaining fifty-two were regularly &s;erved.</P>
<P>The very bad con&s;equences ari&s;ing from this &s;hameful remi&s;&s;ne&s;s among the clergy, induced Mr. Gilpin to &s;upply, as far as he
<PB N="172" REF="174">could, what was wanting in others. Every year therefore he u&s;ed regularly to vi&s;it the mo&s;t neglected pari&s;hes in Northumberland, York&s;hire, Che&s;hire, We&s;tmorland, and Cum|berland: and that his own pari&s;h, in the mean time, might not &s;uffer, he was at the expence of a con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tant. In each place he &s;tayed two or three days, and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as po&s;&s;ible, the danger of leading wicked or even carele&s;s lives&mdash;explaining to them the nature of true religion&mdash;in&s;tructing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and them|&s;elves&mdash;and &s;hewing them how greatly a mo|ral and religious conduct would contribute to their pre&s;ent as well as future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When a preacher, though the mere&s;t rhap|&s;odi&s;t or enthu&s;ia&s;t, &s;eems to &s;peak from his heart, from a thorough &s;en&s;e of his duty, what he &s;ays will be li&s;tened to. The ap|pearance of his being truly in earne&s;t, will di&s;po&s;e men at lea&s;t to give him a fair hear|ing. Hence Mr. Gilpin, who had all the warmth of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, though under the direction of a very calm judgment, never
<PB N="173" REF="175">wanted an audience even in the wilde&s;t part; where he rou&s;ed many to a &s;en&s;e of religion, who had contracted the mo&s;t inveterate ha|bits of inattention to every things of a &s;erious nature.</P>
<P>One thing he practi&s;ed, which &s;hewed the be&s;t-di&s;po&s;ed heart. Where ever he came, he u&s;ed to vi&s;it all the jails and places of con|finement; few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed mini&s;ter. And by his la|bours, and affectionate manner of behaving, he is &s;aid to have reformed many very abandon|ed per&s;ons in tho&s;e places. He would employ his intere&s;t likewi&s;e for &s;uch criminals, who&s;e ca&s;es he thought attended with any hard cir|cum&s;tances, and often procured pardons for them.</P>
<P>There is a tract of country upon the bor|der of Northumberland, called Reads-dale and Tine-dale; of all barbarous places in the north, at that time the mo&s;t barbarous. The fol|lowing very picture&s;que de&s;cription of this wild country we have from Mr. Camden:</P>

<P><PB N="175" REF="177">Before the union this coutry was gene|rally called the debateable land, as &s;ubject by turns to England and Scotland, and the com|mon theatre where the two nations were con|tinually acting their bloody &s;cenes.

They lived by theft; u&s;ed to plunder on both &s;ides of the barrier, and what they plunder|ed on one, they expo&s;ed to &s;ale on the other; by that means e&s;caping ju&s;tice. Such adepts were they in the art of thieving, that they could twi&s;t a cow's horn, or mark a hor&s;e, &s;o as its owners could not know it; and &s;o &s;ubtle, that no vigilance could guard again&s;t them.

<P><PB N="176" REF="178">In this dreadful country, where no man would even travel that could help it, Mr. Gil|pin never failed to &s;pend &s;ome part of every year. He generally cho&s;e the holidays of Chri&s;tmas for this journey, becau&s;e he found the people at that &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t di&s;engaged, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled. He had &s;et places for preaching which were as regularly attended, as the a&s;&s;ize-towns of a circuit.

<P>This was a very difficult and laborious em|ployment. The country was &s;o poor, that what provi&s;ion he could get, extreme hunger only could make palatable.

<P>It happened that a quarrel of this kind was on foot, when Mr. Gilpin was at Rothbury in tho&s;e parts. During the two or three fir&s;t days of his preaching, the contending parties ob&s;erved &s;ome decorum, and never appeared at church together. At length however they met. One party had been early at church, and ju&s;t as Mr. Gilpin began his &s;ermon, the other entered. They &s;tood not long &s;ilent. Inflamed at the &s;ight of each other, they be|gin to cla&s;h their weapons, for they were all armed with javelins and &s;words, and mutually
<PB N="179" REF="181">approach. Awed however by the &s;acredne&s;s of the place, the tumult in &s;ome degree cea&s;ed. Mr. Gilpin proceeded: when again the combatants begin to brandi&s;h their wea|pons, and draw towards each other. As a fray &s;eemed near, Mr. Gilpin &s;tepped from the pulpit, went between them, and addre&s;&s;|ing the leaders, put an end to the quarrel for the pre&s;ent, but could not effect an entire re|conciliation. They promi&s;ed him however, that till the &s;ermon was over, they would make no more di&s;turbance. He then went again into the pulpit, and &s;pent the re&s;t of the time in endeavouring to make them a&s;hamed of what they had done. His behaviour and di&s;|cour&s;e affected them &s;o much, that at his far|ther entreaty, they promi&s;ed to forbear all acts of ho&s;tility, while he continued in the country. And &s;o much re&s;pected was he among them, that whoever was in fear of his enemy, u&s;ed to re&s;ort where Mr. Gilpin was, e&s;teeming his pre&s;ence the be&s;t protection.</P>
<P>One &s;unday morning coming to a church in tho&s;e parts before the people were a&s;&s;em|bled, he ob&s;erved a glove hanging up, and was informed by the &s;exton, that it was meant
<PB N="180" REF="182">as a challenge to any one that &s;hould take it down. Mr. Gilpin ordered the &s;exton to reach it him; but upon his utterly refu&s;ing to touch it, he took it down him&s;elf, and put it in his brea&s;t. When the people were a&s;|&s;embled, he went into the pulpit; and before he concluded his &s;ermon, took occa&s;ion to re|buke them &s;everely for the&s;e inhuman chal|lenges. 'I hear, &s;aith he, that one among you hath hanged up a glove even in this &s;a|cred place, threatening to fight any one who taketh it down: &s;ee, I have taken it down;' and pulling out the glove, he held it up to the congregation; and then &s;hewed them how un&s;uitable &s;uch &s;avage practices were to the profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity; u&s;ing &s;uch per|&s;ua&s;ives to mutual love, as he thought would mo&s;t affect them.</P>
<P>The di&s;intere&s;ted pains he thus took among the&s;e barbarous people, and the good offices he was always ready to do them, drew from them the &s;incere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, a virtue perhaps as frequently the growth of the&s;e natural &s;oils, as of the be&s;t cultivated. Indeed he was little le&s;s than adored, and might have brought the whole country almo&s;t
<PB N="181" REF="183">to what he plea&s;ed.&mdash;How greatly his name was revered among them one in&s;tance will &s;hew.</P>
<P>By the carle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his &s;ervant, his hor&s;es were one day &s;tolen. The news was quickly propagated, and every one expre&s;&s;ed the high|e&s;t indignation at the fact. The thief was rejoicing over his prize, when by the report of the country he found whole hor&s;es he had taken. Terrified at what he had done, he in&s;tantly came trembling back, confe&s;&s;ed the fact, returned the hor&s;es, and declared he believed the devil would have &s;eized him directly, had he carried them off, knowing them to have been Mr. Gilpin's.</P>
<P>Thus I have brought together what parti|culars &s;till remain of this excellent man's be|haviour as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. They di&s;cover &s;o very good a heart, &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e or duty, and &s;o &s;trict a regard to it in every in&s;tance, as would have been admired even in primitive times: the corruptions now prevailing may perhaps make their truth que&s;tionable; but they are all either taken from his life written by the bi&s;hop of Chi|che&s;ter,
<PB N="182" REF="184">or from papers of undoubted autho|rity.&mdash;His own te&s;timony to what hath been &s;aid &s;hall be &s;ubjoined in the following ex|tract.</P>

I am fir&s;t greatly bur|dened about &s;eeing the lands made &s;ure to the &s;chool; which are not &s;o yet, and are in great danger to be lo&s;t, if God &s;hould call me afore they are a&s;&s;ured. Moreover I have a&s;&s;igned to preach twelve &s;ermons at other pari&s;hes, be&s;ide my own; and like|wi&s;e am earne&s;tly looked for at a number of pari&s;hes in Northumberland, more than I can vi&s;it. Be&s;ide, I am continually encum|bered with many gue&s;ts and acquaintance, whom I may not well refu&s;e. And often I am called upon by many of my pa|ri&s;hioners, to &s;et them at one when they cannot agree. And every day I am &s;ore charged and troubled with many &s;ervants and workfolks, which is no &s;mall trouble to me; for the buildings and repara|tions
<PB N="183" REF="185">in this wide hou&s;e will never have an end.</Q></P>
<P>I will conclude this &s;ection with an in&s;tance of that re&s;olution and &s;pirit, which on each proper occa&s;ion he failed not to exert; and by which he always maintained that indepen|dency and real dignity, which became his &s;tation.</P>
<P>He received a me&s;&s;age one day from Dr. Barns, bi&s;hop of Durham, appointing him to preach a vi&s;itation-&s;ermon the &s;unday fol|lowing. It happened he was then preparing for his journey into Reads-dale and Tine-dale: he acquainted the bi&s;hop therefore with the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping that appointment, begg|ing his lord&s;hip would at that time excu&s;e him. His &s;ervant informed him that the bi&s;hop had received his me&s;&s;age, but return|ed no an&s;wer. Concluding him therefore &s;a|tisfied, he &s;et out on his journey: but to his great &s;urprize, when he came home, found him&s;elf &s;u&s;pended; &s;ome per&s;ons, through enmity to him, having put the bi&s;hop upon this ha&s;ty &s;tep. A few days after he received an order to meet the bi&s;hop at Che&s;ter, a
<PB N="184" REF="186">town in the dioce&s;e of Durham, where the bi&s;hops of that &s;ee formerly re&s;ided. Here many of the clergy were a&s;&s;embled, and Mr. Gilpin was ordered by the bi&s;hop to preach that day before them. He made his apology; He had come wholly unprepared&mdash;be&s;ides he was &s;u&s;pended, and thereby excluded from the pulpit. The bi&s;hop an&s;wered, he took off his &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. But Mr. Gilpin &s;till begg|ed to be excu&s;ed&mdash;he had brought no &s;ermon with him, and hoped none would be require|ed from him. But the bi&s;hop would take no excu&s;e; telling him, that as he had been a preacher &s;o long, he mu&s;t be able to &s;ay enough to the purpo&s;e without any previous meditation. Mr. Gilpin per&s;i&s;ting in his re|fu&s;al, the bi&s;hop at length grew warm, and required him upon his canonical obedience to go immediately into the pulpit. After a little delay therefore he went up; and though he ob&s;erved &s;everal taking notes of what he &s;aid, he proceeded without the lea&s;t he&s;itation.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical court of Durham was at this time very &s;candalou&s;ly governed. That Mr. Barns pre&s;ided over it, who hath already
<PB N="185" REF="187">been mentioned; and who made it indeed little better than an office for granting indulgen|cies. The bi&s;hop was a well-meaning, weak man; irre&s;olute, and wholly in the hands of others. Every thing was managed by his re|lation the chancellor; who&s;e venality, and the irregularities occa&s;ioned by it, were mo&s;t no|torious.</P>
<P>The opportunity now afforded him Mr. Gilpin thought no unfavourable one to open the bi&s;hop's eyes; and induce him to exert him&s;elf where there was &s;o great rea&s;on for it. Private information had often been given him without any &s;ucce&s;s: Mr. Gilpin was now re&s;olved therefore to venture upon a public application to him. Accordingly, before he concluded his &s;ermon, he turned towards the bi&s;hop, to whom he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>My di&s;cour&s;e now, reverend father, mu&s;t be directed to you. God hath exalted you to be the bi&s;hop of this dioce&s;e, and requir|eth an account of your government thereof. A reformation of all tho&s;e matters which are ami&s;s in this church, is expected at your hands. And now, le&s;t perhaps, while it is
<PB N="186" REF="188">apparent, that &s;o many enormities are com|mitted every where, your lord&s;hip &s;hould make an&s;wer, that you had no notice of them given you, and that the&s;e things ne|ver came to your knowledge,</Q> for this it &s;eems was the bi&s;hop's common apology to all complainants, <Q>behold I bring the&s;e things to your knowledge this day. Say not then that the&s;e crimes have been committed by the fault of others without your knowledge; for whatever either your&s;elf &s;hall do in per|&s;on, or &s;uffer through your connivance to be done by others, is wholly your own. Therefore in the pre&s;ence of God, his an|gels, and men, I pronounce you to be the author of all the&s;e evils: yea, and in that &s;trict: day of the general account, I will be a witne&s;s to te&s;tify again&s;t you, that all the&s;e things have come to your knowledge by my means: and all the&s;e men &s;hall bear wit|ne&s;s thereof, who have heard me &s;peak unto you this day.</Q></P>
<P>This freedom alarmed every one. As Mr. Gilpin went out of the church, his friends gathered round him, kindly reproaching him,
<PB N="187" REF="189">with tears, for what he had done&mdash;'The bi|&s;hop had now got that advantage over him which he had long &s;ought after&mdash;and if he had injured him before without provocation, what would he do now, &s;o greatly exa&s;pe|rated?' Mr. Gilpin walked on, gently keep|ing them off with his hand, and a&s;&s;uring them, that if his di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould do the &s;ervice he intended by it, he was regard|le&s;s what the con&s;equence might be to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>During that day nothing el&s;e was talked of. Every one commended what had been &s;aid, but was apprehen&s;ive for the &s;peaker. Tho&s;e about the bi&s;hop waited in &s;ilent ex|pectation, when his re&s;entment would break out.</P>
<P>After dinner Mr. Gilpin went up to the bi&s;hop, to pay his compliments to him, be|fore he went home. 'Sir, &s;aid the bi&s;hop, I propo&s;e to wait upon you home my&s;elf.'&mdash;This he according'y did: and as &s;oon as Mr. Gilpin had carried him into a parlour, the bi&s;hop turned &s;uddenly round, and &s;eiz|ing him eagerly by the hand, 'Father
<PB N="188" REF="190">Gilpin, &s;ays he to him, I acknowledge you are fitter to be the bi&s;hop of Durham than I am to be par&s;on of this church of yours.&mdash;I a&s;k forgivene&s;s for pa&s;t injuries&mdash;For|give me, father.&mdash;I know you have enemies; but while I live bi&s;hop of Durham, be &s;e|cure, none of them &s;hall cau&s;e you any fur|ther trouble.'</P>

<P>THOUGH Mr. Gilpin was chiefly &s;o|licitous about the morals of tho&s;e committed to his care, he omitted not how|ever to promote, as far as he could, their temporal happine&s;s. What wealth he had, was entirely laid out in charities and ho&s;pi|tality.</P>
<P>The value of his living was about four hundred pounds a year: an income which, however con&s;iderable at that time, was yet in appearance very unproportionate to the gene|rous things he did: indeed he could not have done them, unle&s;s his frugality had been equal to his genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>In building a &s;chool, and purcha&s;ing lands for the maintenance of a ma&s;ter and u&s;her, he expended above five hundred pounds. As there was &s;o great a re&s;ort of young people to this &s;chool, that in a little time the town was not able to accommodate them, he put him|&s;elf to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e, where he &s;eldom had fewer than twenty or thirty chil|dren.
<PB N="190" REF="192">Some of the&s;e were the &s;ons of per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction, whom he boarded at ea&s;y rates: but the greater part were poor chil|dren, who could not &s;o ea&s;ily get them&s;elves boarded in the town; and whom he not only educated, but cloathed and maintained: he was at the expence likewi&s;e of boarding in the town many other poor children. He u&s;ed to bring &s;everal every year from the dif|ferent parts where he preached, particularly Reads-dale and Tine-dale; which places he was at great pains in civilizing, and contri|buted not a little towards rooting out that barbari&s;m, which every year prevailed le&s;s among them.</P>
<P>For the maintenance of poor &s;cholars at the univer&s;ities, he yearly &s;et apart &s;ixty pounds. This &s;um he always laid out, often more. His common allowance to each &s;cho|lar was about ten pounds a year: which for a &s;ober youth was at that time a very &s;uffi|cient maintenance: &s;o that he never main|tained fewer than &s;ix. By his will it appears, that at his death he had nine upon his li&s;t; whom he took care to provide for during their &s;tay at the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193">Every thur&s;day throughout the year a very large quantity of meat was dre&s;&s;ed wholly for the poor; and every day they had what quan|tity of broth they wanted. Twenty-four of the poore&s;t were his con&s;tant pen&s;ioners. Four times in the year a dinner was provided for them, when they received from his &s;teward a certain quantity of corn, and a &s;um of mo|ney: and at Chri&s;tmas they had always an ox divided among them.</P>
<P>Wherever he heard of any in di&s;tre&s;s, whe|ther of his own pari&s;h, or any other, he was &s;ure to relieve them. In his walks abroad he would frequently bring home with him poor people, and &s;end them away cloathed as well as fed.</P>
<P>He took great pains to inform him&s;elf of the circum&s;tances of his neighbours, that the mode&s;ty of the &s;ufferer might not prevent his relief.</P>
<P>But the money be&s;t laid out was, in his opinion, that which encouraged indu&s;try. It was one of his greate&s;t plea&s;ures to make up the lo&s;&s;es of his laborious neighbours, and prevent their &s;inking under them. If a poor man had lo&s;t a bea&s;t, he would &s;end him
<PB N="192" REF="194">another In its room: or if any farmer had had a bad year, he would make him an abate|ment in his tithes.&mdash;Thus, as far as he was able, he took the misfortunes of his pari&s;h upon him&s;elf; and like a true &s;hepherd ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf for his flock.</P>
<P>But of all kinds of indu&s;trious poor, he was mo&s;t forward to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who had large families: &s;uch never failed to meet with his bounty, when they wanted to &s;ettle their chil|dren in the world.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tant pari&s;hes where he preached, as well as in his own neighbourhood, his ge|nero&s;ity and benevolence were continually &s;hewing them&s;elves; particularly in the de&s;o|late parts of Northumberland: <Q>When he began his journey, &s;ays an old manu&s;cript life of him, he would have ten pounds in his pur&s;e; and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt, which he would always pay within a fortnight after.</Q>&mdash;In the jails he vi&s;ited, he was not only careful to give the pri&s;oners proper in&s;truc|tions, but u&s;ed to purcha&s;e for them likewi&s;e what nece&s;&s;aries they wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">Even upon the public road he never let &s;lip an opportunity of doing good. Often has he been known to take off his cloak, and give it to an half-naked traveller: and when he has had &s;carce money enough in his pocket to provide him&s;elf a dinner, yet would he give away part of that little, or the whole, if he found any who &s;eemed to &s;tand in need of it.&mdash;Of this benevolent temper the following in&s;tance is pre&s;erved. One day returning home, he &s;aw in a field &s;everal people croud|ing together; and judging &s;omething more than ordinary had happened, he rode up, and found that one of the hor&s;es in a team had &s;uddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to rai&s;e; but in vain, for the hor&s;e was dead. The owner of it &s;eeming much dejected with his misfortune, and de|claring how grievous a lo&s;s it Would be to him, Mr. Gilpin bad him not be di&s;heartened; 'I'll let you have, &s;ays he, hone&s;t man, that hor&s;e of mine,' and pointed to his &s;ervant's.&mdash;'Ah! ma&s;ter, replied the countryman, my pocket will not reach &s;uch a bea&s;t as that.'&mdash;'Come, come, &s;aid Mr. Gilpin, take him,
<PB N="194" REF="196">take him, and when I demand my money, then thou &s;halt pay me.'</P>
<P>His ho&s;pitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He &s;pent in his family every fortnight forty bu&s;hels of corn, twenty bu&s;hels of malt, and a whole ox; be&s;ides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Strangers and travellers found a chearful reception. All were welcome that came; and even their bea&s;ts had &s;o much care taken of them, that it was humourou&s;ly &s;aid, 'If a hor&s;e was turned loo&s;e in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton's.'</P>
<P>Every &s;unday from Michaelmas till Ea&s;ter, was a &s;ort of a public day with him. During this &s;ea&s;on he expected to &s;ee all his pari&s;hio|ners and their families. For their reception he had three tables well covered: the fir&s;t was for gentlemen, the &s;econd for hu&s;band|men and farmers, and the third for day-la|bourers.&mdash;This piece of ho&s;pitality he never omitted, even when lo&s;&s;es, or a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion, made its continuance rather diffi|cult to him. He thought it his duty, and
<PB N="195" REF="197">that was a deciding motive. <Q>If you &s;hould, as you threaten, (&s;ays he in a letter to his old enemy chancellor Barns, give out a &s;e|que&s;tration of my benefice, you &s;hall do me a greater favour than you are aware of. For at this time I am run in no &s;mall debt. I want likewi&s;e provi&s;ion of victuals. Where I have had again&s;t Michaelmas &s;ix or &s;even fat oxen, and five or &s;ix fat cows, I have now neither cow nor ox, but mu&s;t &s;eek all from the &s;hambles. A &s;eque&s;tra|tion given out, I may with hone&s;ty break up hou&s;e for a &s;pace, which will &s;ave me twenty or thirty pounds in my pur&s;e. But I tru&s;t you will think better of this matter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e times, (&s;ays he, in another letter) make me &s;o tired of hou&s;e-keeping, that I would I were di&s;charged from it, if it could be with a clear con&s;cience.</Q></P>
<P>Even when he was ab&s;ent, no alteration was made in his family-expences: the poor was fed a u&s;ual, and his neighbours enter|tained.</P>
<P>He was always glad of the company of men of worth and letters, who u&s;ed much to frequent his hou&s;e. This &s;ociable temper led
<PB N="196" REF="198">him into a very large acquaintance; which, as he could not &s;elect his company, became very inconvenient to him when he grew old. I &s;hall clo&s;e this account of his manner of living with a &s;tory, which does no little ho|nour to his hou&s;e-keeping.</P>
<P>Some affairs in Scotland obliging queen Elizabeth to &s;end thither her trea&s;urer, the lord Burleigh, he re&s;olved to take the oppor|tunity of his return to pay a vi&s;it to Mr. Gil|pin. Hurried as he was, he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of &s;eeing a man, who&s;e name was every where &s;o re&s;pectfully mentioned. His free di&s;cour&s;e from the pulpit to king Ed|ward's court, had early recommended him to this noble per&s;on; &s;ince which time the great di&s;tance between them had wholly interrupt|ed their acquaintance. The trea&s;urer's return was &s;o &s;udden, that he had not time to give any notice of his intended vi&s;it. But the oeconomy of &s;o plentiful a hou&s;e as Mr. Gilpin's was not ea&s;ily di&s;concerted. He received his noble gue&s;t with &s;o much true politene&s;s, and treated him and his whole retinue in &s;o affluent and gene|rous a manner, that the trea&s;urer would often afterwards &s;ay, 'He could hardly have ex|pected
<PB N="197" REF="199">more at Lambeth.' While lord Bur|leigh &s;tayed at Houghton, he took great pains by his own, and the ob&s;ervation of his do|me&s;tics, to acquaint him&s;elf with the order and regularity with which every thing in that hou&s;e was managed. It contained a very large family; and was be&s;ides continually crouded with per&s;ons of all kinds, gentlemen, &s;cholars, workmen, farmers, and poor people: yet there was never any confu&s;ion; every one was immediately carried into proper apartments, and entertained, directed, or relieved, as his particular bu&s;ine&s;s required. It could not but plea&s;e this wi&s;e lord, who was &s;o well ac|quainted with the effects of order and regu|larity in the highe&s;t &s;phere, to ob&s;erve them even in this humble one. Here too he &s;aw true &s;implicity of manners, and every &s;ocial virtue regulated by exact prudence. The &s;tate&s;man began to unbend, and he could not without an envious eye compare the unquiet &s;cenes of vice and vanity in which he was en|gaged, with the calmne&s;s of this amiable re|treat. At length with reluctance he took his leave; and with all the warmth of affection embracing his much re&s;pected friend, he told
<PB N="198" REF="200">him, 'He had heard great things in his com|mendation, but he had now &s;een what far exceeded all that he had heard. If, added he, Mr. Gilpin, I can ever be of any &s;ervice to you at court, or el&s;ewhere, u&s;e me with all freedom as one you may depend on.' When he had got to Rainton-hill, which ri&s;es about a mile from Houghton, and commands the vale, he turned his hor&s;e to take one more view of the place: and having kept his eye fixed upon it for &s;ome time, his reverie broke out into this exclamation: 'There is the en|joyment of life indeed!&mdash;who can blame that man for not accepting of a bi&s;hopric!&mdash;what doth he want to make him greater, or hap|pier, or more u&s;eful to mankind!'</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature in which Mr. Gilpin was engaged was the &s;ettlement of his &s;chool. It an&s;wered his expectations &s;o well by the good it did in the country, that when he grew old, it became his chief concern. His infirmities obliged him now to relax a little from tho&s;e very great fatigues he had undergone abroad, and to draw his engagements nearer home. His &s;chool, &s;ituated near his hou&s;e, afforded him, when mo&s;t infirm, an employment; and he thought he could hardly die in peace till he had &s;ettled it to his mind. What he had principally at heart, was to compo&s;e for it a &s;et of good &s;tatutes, to provide it a better endow|ment, and to fix all by a charter.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tatutes, he was daily employed in correcting, adding to, and altering, tho&s;e he had drawn up; advi&s;ing with his friends, and doing all in his power to prevent any fu|ture abu&s;e of his charity.</P>
<P>With regard to a better endowment, it was not indeed in his own power to do any thing
<PB N="200" REF="202">more. His exhibitions, his other charities, and his generous manner of living, made yearly &s;uch large demands upon him, which increa&s;ed as he grew old, that it became then impo&s;&s;ible for him to lay up any thing. He would gladly have contracted his ho&s;pitality, which he thought his lea&s;t u&s;eful expence; but when he con&s;idered, that he might pro|bably by that means lo&s;e much of the e&s;teem of the people, he could not prevail with him|&s;elf to do it. Thus unable to do any thing more out of his own pur&s;e, he turned his eyes upon his friends.</P>
<P>There was a gentleman in the neighbour|hood, John Heath, e&s;quire, of Kepier, with whom Mr. Gilpin had lived for many years in great intimacy. He was a man of un|common worth, was ma&s;ter of a plentiful fortune, and had an inclination to put it to the be&s;t u&s;es. He was be&s;ides a man of let|ters, and an encourager of learning. To this gentleman Mr. Gilpin applied in favour of his &s;chool: Mr. Heath came with great rea|dine&s;s into the &s;cheme propo&s;ed to him, and doubled the original endowment. Mr. Gil|pin prevailed upon &s;ome others likewi&s;e to
<PB N="201" REF="203">contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by which means the revenues of the &s;chool became at length an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained a &s;ufficient endow|ment, he began next to think of a charter. For this he applied to his friend the earl of Bedford.</P>
<P>The two following letters from that earl are here in&s;erted, rather indeed to &s;hew his friend&s;hip for Mr. Gilpin, than becau&s;e they are otherwi&s;e very material.</P>

<P>One of Mr. Gilpin's la&s;t good actions was his endeavour to convert a young je&s;uit. A friend of his, one Mr. Geni&s;on of Newca&s;tle, had taken into his hou&s;e a brother's &s;on, who having been &s;ome time in Italy, and there inveigled by the je&s;uits, had been taken into their order. His time of di&s;cipline being
<PB N="204" REF="206">over, he was &s;ent into England, whither he brought with him the zeal of a novice. His uncle, a man of good plain &s;en&s;e, &s;oon di&s;|covered what had happened; and being great|ly afflicted that his nephew was not only be|come a papi&s;t, but a je&s;uit, &s;aid what he could to recover him from his errors. But the young man had got his di&s;tinctions too per|fect to be influenced by his uncle's arguments. The old gentleman therefore not knowing what to do with him him&s;elf, at length thought of Mr. Gilpin. To him he wrote, told him the whole affair, and earne&s;tly in|treated him, if he had any friend&s;hip &s;or him, to try what impre&s;&s;ion he could make, upon his nephew. Mr. Gilpin had little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from what he had heard of the young man's character; and &s;till le&s;s when he &s;aw him. He was naturally very full of him&s;elf, and this turn his education had increa&s;ed. In&s;tead of examining atten|tively what was &s;aid, and giving pertinent an|&s;wers, he was &s;till running from the point, advancing hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own tenets, and defending them by &s;trained interpretations of &s;cripture, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;application of it. The truth
<PB N="205" REF="207">was, he wanted to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by mak|ing &s;ome eminent per&s;on his convert; and his vanity led him to expect, that he might bring over Mr. Gilpin. This was indeed the chief thing he propo&s;ed in coming to Houghton. When he found he failed in this, he did what he could to corrupt the &s;ervants, and &s;uch of the &s;cholars and coun|try-people as came in his way. He became at length &s;o very di&s;agreeable, that Mr. Gil|pin was obliged to de&s;ire his uncle to &s;end for him again. His letter upon the occa&s;ion di&s;covers &s;o much hone&s;ty of heart, and &s;o beautiful a &s;implicity of manners, that it de|&s;erves very well to be in&s;erted.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I tru&s;t, &s;ir, you remember that when you fir&s;t &s;pake to me about your brother's &s;on, your promi&s;e was, that I &s;hould have a licence from the bi&s;hop, for my warrant. But that is not done. Wherefore you mu&s;t either get one your&s;elf, or &s;uffer me. For our curate and churchwardens are &s;worn to pre&s;ent, if any be in the pari&s;h, which ut|terly refu&s;e to come to church. I only de|&s;ired him that he would come into the
<PB N="206" REF="208">quire in the &s;ermon-time, but half an hour; which he utterly refu&s;ed, and willed me to &s;peak no more of it. He is indeed fix|ed in his errors; and I have perceived by his talk, that his coming here was not to learn, but to teach: for thinking to find me half a papi&s;t, he tru&s;ted to win me over en|tirely. But whereas, I tru&s;t in God, I have put him clearly from that hope; yet I &s;tand in great danger, that he &s;hall do much hurt in my hou&s;e, or in the pari&s;h; for he cometh furni&s;hed with all the learn|ing of the hot college of je&s;uits. They have found out, I perceive, certain expo|&s;itions of the old te&s;tament, never heard of before, to prove the invocation of &s;aints from Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob. He will not grant that any thing hath been wrong in the church of Rome: the mo&s;t abomi|nable errors of indulgencies, pardons, fal&s;e miracles, and fal&s;e reliques, pilgrimages, and &s;uch like, he can find them all in the go&s;pel; and will have them all to be good and holy.&mdash;For my part, I have determin|ed my&s;elf otherwi&s;e: age and want of me|mory compel me to take my leave of this
<PB N="207" REF="209">wretched world; and at this time of life not to &s;tudy an&s;wers to &s;uch trumpery, and new inventions; &s;eeing I was never any di&s;puter in all my life. I tru&s;t there be learned men enough in the univer&s;ities, who will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer all that ever they can bring that is worth an&s;wering.&mdash;Wherefore, good Mr. Geni&s;on, &s;eeing your cou&s;in is fixed in his errors, as he plainly confe&s;&s;eth, help to ea&s;e me of this burthen, that I may with quietne&s;s apply to my vo|cation. I am &s;ent for to preach in divers places, but I cannot go from home, &s;o long as he is here. People in the&s;e evil days are given to learn more &s;uper&s;tition in a week, than true religion in &s;even years.&mdash;But if notwith&s;tanding you are de&s;irous to have him tarry two or three weeks longer, I mu&s;t needs have licence from the bi&s;hop: whether you will get the &s;ame, or I mu&s;t, I refer to your good plea&s;ure.&mdash;And &s;o I pray God to pre&s;erve you evermore.

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="208" REF="210">Notwith&s;tanding what is &s;aid in this letter, it &s;eems probable, that Mr. Gilpin's argu|ments at length made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon the young man: for he entered afterwards into a &s;erious di&s;pute in writing with him; which he would &s;carce have engaged in, un|le&s;s the je&s;uit had &s;hewn greater willingne&s;s to di&s;cover truth, than what had yet ap|peared.</P>
<P>'As &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ores, and other troubles,' &s;ays Mr. Gilpin to him in a letter, <Q>;would &s;uffer me, I have an&s;wered your objections out of St. Au&s;tin: and the chief of them, I tru&s;t, are an&s;wered to the contentation of &s;uch as are willing to &s;tay their con&s;cience upon God and his word, and not upon man's vain inventions, wherein they &s;hall find no re&s;t of con&s;cience, nor quietne&s;s of mind.&mdash;When lei&s;ure will &s;erve to fini&s;h the re&s;idue, I will &s;end them unto you. In the mean time I pray God to illuminate your eyes with his heavenly light, and to guide your feet into the way of peace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211">Towards the latter part of his life, Mr. Gilpin went through his duty with great dif|ficulty. His health was much impaired. The extreme fatigue he had during &s;o many years undergone, had now quite broke his con&s;titution. Thus he complains in a letter to a friend: <Q>To &s;u&s;tain all the&s;e travels and troubles I have a very weak body, &s;ub|ject to many di&s;ea&s;es; by the monitions whereof, I am daily warned to remember death. My greate&s;t grief of all is, that my memory is quite decayed: my &s;ight fail|eth; my hearing faileth; with other ail|ments, more than I can well expre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>While he was thus &s;truggling with an ad|vanced age, and much impaired con&s;titution, there happened a very unfortunate affair, which entirely de&s;troyed his health. As he was cro&s;&s;ing the market-place at Durham, an ox ran at him, and pu&s;hed him down with &s;uch violence, that it was imagined the brui&s;es he received weuld have occa&s;ioned his death. He lay long confined; and though he again got abroad, he never recovered even the little &s;trength he had before, and con|tinued lame as long as he lived. But ac|cidents
<PB N="210" REF="212">of this kind were no very formidable trials to a mind &s;o well tempered as his. It was a per&s;ua&s;ion he had long entertained, that misfortunes are intended by providence to re|mind us of our neglected duty: and thus he always u&s;ed them, making &s;elf-examina|tion the con&s;tant attendant upon whatever calamities be&s;el him. To this it was owing that misfortunes never dejected him, but were received by him rather with thankful|ne&s;s than repining.</P>
<P>But &s;ickne&s;s was not the only di&s;tre&s;s which the declining years of this excellent man had to &s;truggle with. As age and in|firmity began to le&s;&s;en that weight and in|fluence he once had, the malice and oppo&s;i|tion of his enemies of cour&s;e prevailed more.</P>
<P>Of what frivolous pretences they availed them&s;elves, and with what temper he bore their malice, the following letters will &s;hew better than any narrative.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I am very &s;orry, Mr. Wren, to hear that you &s;hould fall into &s;uch unlawful contention with any one; and that, to main|tain an evil cau&s;e, you &s;hould make an un|true
<PB N="211" REF="213">report of me. I am very glad how|ever that the two other fal&s;e reports, if it be as you &s;ay, were not rai&s;ed by you: one, that I &s;hould make the marriage of mini|&s;ters unlawful; the other, that I &s;hould make their children ba&s;tards. Whereas certainly it is known, that long ago I was accu&s;ed before bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal for &s;peaking in favour of prie&s;ts marriage: &s;ince which time I have never altered my mind; but in my &s;ermons in this country, Northum|berland, We&s;tmorland, Cumberland, York|&s;hire, and Lanca&s;hire, I have, as oppor|tunity &s;erved, &s;poken in defence of prie&s;ts marriage. And allowing their marriage, I tru&s;t no man will believe that I &s;hould make their children ba&s;tards.</P>
<P>You &s;ay I am called hypocrite: I know I am &s;o of divers. How they will an&s;wer God's law therein, I leave to their own con&s;cience. But verily for my own part I can thank them; for when I hear it, I tru&s;t in God, I gain not a little thereby in &s;tudying clearly to &s;ubdue that vice; which I have &s;trived again&s;t ever &s;ince I &s;tudied the holy &s;criptures. And I &s;uppo&s;e very
<PB N="212" REF="214">few or no preachers in England have preach|ed oftener again&s;t that vice than I; and that, as I tru&s;t, with a clear con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But to make an end at this time (becau&s;e this bearer can &s;hew you what &s;mall time I have, being &s;ore overcharged with mani|fold &s;tudies and bu&s;ine&s;&s;es) it is time, good Mr. Wren, both for you and me (age and &s;undry di&s;ea&s;es, me&s;&s;engers of death, giv|ing us warning) more deeply to rype our own con&s;ciences, and more diligently to &s;earch our own faults, and to leave off from curi|ous hearkening and e&s;pying of other mens: e&s;pecially when it breedeth contention, and can in no wi&s;e edify. I pray you read St. James, the latter part of the 3d chapter, and there learn from whence cometh con|tentious wi&s;dom. And this, I be&s;eech you, remember, that it is not long &s;ince God did mo&s;t mercifully vi&s;it you with great &s;ick|ne&s;s. At that time I doubt not but you lamented &s;ore your duty forgotten in your life pa&s;t: and for the time to come, if God would re&s;tore you to your health, I tru&s;t you promi&s;ed a godly repentance, and reformation of life.

<P>But of all his enemies the mo&s;t active were Hugh Broughton, and chancellor Barns.</P>
<P>Broughton acted the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t un|grateful part. Mr. Gilpin had educated and maintained him both at &s;chool and the uni|ver&s;ity, and had always &s;hewn him every civility in his power. Yet this man was af|terwards vile enough to endeavour to &s;upplant the very patron who rai&s;ed him. He had craftily in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the bi&s;hop of Durham's favour, and thought he &s;tood fair for the fir&s;t vacant preferment: and as Houghton was then the be&s;t thing in the bi|&s;hop's gift, he had fixed his eye upon it. Mr. Gilpin was old and infirm, and in all proba|bility could enjoy it but a very few years;
<PB N="215" REF="217">yet Broughton had not patience to let him &s;pend the remainder of his age in peace. He knew the bi&s;hop was ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and found means to prejudice him again&s;t Mr. Gilpin. To this was owing, as appeared afterwards, the affair of the &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion already mentioned, and &s;ome other in|&s;tances of the bi&s;hop's di&s;plea&s;ure. But in the end poor Broughton had the mortifica|tion to &s;ee his indirect mea&s;ures unravelled. The bi&s;hop &s;aw his error, was reconciled to Mr. Gilpin, and continued ever afterwards his &s;teady friend: and Broughton finding him&s;elf neglected, left Durham to &s;eek his fortune el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Chancellor Barns was indeed a more ge|nerous, as he was an open enemy. Be&s;ides, what he did, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure in his own defence; for it mu&s;t be owned Mr. Gilpin was very trouble&s;ome to him in all his de&s;igns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ect. 7.</NOTE>, and generally made the fir&s;t at|tack. After the affair at Che&s;ter however, the chancellor laid a&s;ide all decency; and from that time, nothing in his power that
<PB N="216" REF="218">was di&s;obliging was omitted. But his malice had no other effect, than to give Mr. Gilpin an opportunity of proving how well he had learned the chri&s;tian le&s;&s;ons of meekne&s;s: though at the &s;ame time how becomingly he could exert a decent &s;pirit, when it was needful; and &s;hew, by tempering charity with his di&s;plea&s;ure, that he could be angry and yet not &s;in. To this happy temper the following letters will bear &s;ufficient te&s;ti|mony.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Right wor&s;hipful, after my due com|mendations; the&s;e are to certify you, that my curate paying for me at the la&s;t vi&s;ita|tion forty-fix &s;hillings, paid more than he ought to have done, by about a noble. As for the money, I &s;peak not: I pray God that it may do my lord much good. But I &s;hould be very &s;orry, that through my default it &s;hould remain an everla&s;ting burthen to my &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

<P>This load of calumny, ingratitude, and ill u&s;age, may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed heavy upon him, already &s;inking under a weight of years: yet he bore it with great fortitude; &s;trength|ning him&s;elf with &s;uch con&s;olations, as a good chri&s;tian hath in re&s;erve for all ex|tremities.</P>
<P>His re&s;ignation however was not long ex|erci&s;ed. About the beginning of february, in the year 1583, he found him&s;elf &s;o very weak, that he was &s;en&s;ible his end mu&s;t be drawing near. He told his friends his ap|prehen&s;ions; and &s;poke of his death with that happy compo&s;ure which always at|tends the conclu&s;ion of a good life. He was &s;oon after confined to his chamber. His &s;en&s;es continued perfect to the la&s;t. Of the manner of his taking leave of the world, we have this account.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">A few days before his death, he ordered him&s;elf to be rai&s;ed in his bed; and his friends, acquaintance, and dependents to be called in. He fir&s;t &s;ent for the poor, and beckoning them to his bed-&s;ide, he told them, he found he was going out of the world&mdash;he hoped they would be his wit|ne&s;&s;es at the great day that he had endea|voured to do his duty among them&mdash;and he prayed God to remember them after he was gone&mdash;He would not have them weep for him: if ever he had told them any thing good, he would have them remember that in his &s;tead.&mdash;Above all things, he exhorted them to fear God, and keep his command|ments; telling them, if they would do this, they could never be left comfortle&s;s.</P>
<P>He next ordered his &s;cholars to be called in: to the&s;e likewi&s;e he made a &s;hort &s;peech, reminding them, that this was their time, if they had any de&s;ire to qualify them&s;elves for being of u&s;e in the world&mdash;that learning was well worth their attention, but virtue was much more &s;o.</P>
<P>He next exhorted his &s;ervants; and then &s;ent for &s;everal per&s;ons, who had not hereto|fore
<PB N="221" REF="223">profited by his advice according to his wi&s;hes, and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect. His &s;peech began to falter before he fini&s;hed his exhortations. The remaining hours of his life he &s;pent in prayer, and broken conver&s;a|tions with &s;ome &s;elect friends, mentioning often the con&s;olations of chri&s;tianity&mdash;declaring they were the only true ones,&mdash;that no|thing el&s;e could bring a man peace at the la&s;t. He died upon the fourth of march 1583, in the 66th year of his age.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this account of him with a few ob&s;ervations upon his character; and &s;ome incidents, which I could not introduce properly in any part of the narration.</P>
<P>His per&s;on was tall and &s;lender, in the or|nament of which he was at no pains. He had a particular aver&s;ion to the fopperies of dre&s;s. In his diet he was very temperate, ra|ther ab&s;temious.</P>
<P>His parts were very good. His imagina|tion, memory, and judgment, were lively, retentive, and &s;olid.</P>
<P>His acquirements were as con&s;iderable. By an unwearied application he had ama&s;&s;ed
<PB N="222" REF="224">a great &s;tore of knowledge; and was igno|rant of no part of learning at that time in e&s;teem: in languages, hi&s;tory, and divinity he particularly excelled. He read poetry with a good ta&s;te; him&s;elf, as the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter relates, no mean poet. But he laid out little time in the pur&s;uit of any &s;tudy foreign to his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His temper was naturally warm; and in his youth I meet with in&s;tances of his giving way to pa&s;&s;ion; but he &s;oon got more com|mand of him&s;elf, and at length entirely cor|rected that infirmity.</P>
<P>His di&s;po&s;ition was &s;erious, yet among his particular friends he was commonly chearful, &s;ometimes facetious. His general behaviour was very affable. His &s;everity had no object but him&s;elf: to others he was humble, can|did, and indulgent. Never did virtue &s;it with greater ea&s;e on any one, had le&s;s of mo|ro&s;ene&s;s, or could mix more agreeably with whatever was innocent in common life.</P>
<P>He had a mo&s;t extraordinary &s;kill in the art of managing a fortune. He con&s;idered him&s;elf barely as a &s;teward for other people; and took care therefore that his own de&s;ires
<PB N="223" REF="225">never exceeded what calm rea&s;on could ju&s;ti|fy. Extravagance with him was another word for inju&s;tice. Amid&s;t all his bu&s;ine&s;s he found lei&s;ure to look into his affairs; well knowing that frugality is the &s;upport of charity.</P>
<P>His intimacies were but few. It was his endeavour, as he thought the &s;pirit of chri&s;|tianity required, to dilate, rather than to con|tract his affections. Yet where he profe&s;&s;ed a particular friend&s;hip, he was a religious ob&s;erver of its offices. Of this the follow|ing relation is an in&s;tance. Through his ap|plication the dean and chapter of Durham had be&s;towed a living upon one of his friends. Soon after, Mr. Gilpin was nominated a re|feree in a di&s;pute between them and the arch|bi&s;hop of York: but for &s;ome particular rea&s;ons he excu&s;ed him&s;elf <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The chapter of Durham was in great di&s;order, and in many in&s;tances much complained of. Sandys, arch|bi&s;hop of York, undertook to vi&s;it them: but Whit|ingham, the dean, with&s;tood him; having prevailed upon the lord pre&s;ident of the north to &s;econd him. The archbi&s;hop complained to the council: upon which a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued out by the lord keeper, impower|ing certain per&s;ons to examine the ca&s;e; among whom Mr. Gilpin was named. His rea&s;on for not acting was, mo&s;t probably, becau&s;e he thought the dean and chapter in the wrong.</P></NOTE>. This irritated
<PB N="224" REF="226">the dean and chapter &s;o much, that out of mere pique at him they took away two thirds from the allowance they had a&s;&s;igned to his friend. He did what he could to pa|cify them; but his utmo&s;t endeavours prov|ing fruitle&s;s, he in&s;i&s;ted upon his friend's ac|cepting from him a yearly &s;atisfacion for his lo&s;s <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<HEAD>To Dr. Wil&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>Right wor&s;hipful, whereas I hear your wor&s;hip named of many to the deanery of Durham, the&s;e are mo&s;t humbly to be&s;eech you (if it &s;hall plea&s;e God &s;o to ble&s;s that hou&s;e) that you will help, as I tru&s;t God you may, to redre&s;s, among &s;undry enormities, one which hath happened a year ago or more.&mdash;The dean and chapter of Durham are par&s;ons of a pari&s;h in Northumberland, called Ellingham. The living was better than thirty pounds a year. Our &s;chool-ma&s;ter of Houghton, a &s;cholar of Oxford, made labour for it. At his &s;uit, and mine together, it was granted; as we judged, with all &s;uch commodities as the la&s;t in|cumbent, and others before, had had. But &s;oon after, the dean and chapter took away from the vicar as good as twenty pounds a year; &s;o that the poor man, hav|ing wife and children, might have begged, if I and other friends had not holpen him: God knoweth it hath been a co&s;tly matter to me. But my tru&s;t now is, that your wor&s;hip, knowing the matter, will be willing to help it, and may help it; for the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, Mr. Selby, hath nothing to &s;hew but a pro|mi&s;e from Mr. Whitingham, whereunto the chapter would never con&s;ent. Mr. Ralph Lever can inform you of all the matter. If your wor&s;hip can help it,
<PB N="225" REF="227">&s;urely you cannot do a better deed. Would to God all violent workers of injuries were re&s;i&s;ted?&mdash;If God &s;hould &s;end you into this country, I tru&s;t to be better known to your wor&s;hip. I pray God pre&s;erve you evermore. By your's to his power,</P>

<PB N="224" REF="226"></NOTE> At another time a friend de&s;ired he
<PB N="225" REF="227">would reque&s;t the bi&s;hop of Durham to lend him a &s;um of money: he made the application; but not &s;ucceeding, he wrote thus to his friend: <Q>My lord hath lent to &s;o very many, (which I believe is true) that you mu&s;t pardon him for not &s;ending you the money. I pray you trouble him no more; and I tru&s;t by little and little I can make up the &s;um my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>He was the mo&s;t candid interpreter of the words and actions of others: where he plainly &s;aw failings, he would make every po&s;&s;ible allowance for them. He u&s;ed to expre&s;s a particular indignation at &s;lander; often &s;aying, it more de&s;erved the gallows than theft. For him&s;elf, he was remark|ably guarded when he &s;poke of others: he con&s;idered common fame as the fal&s;e&s;t me|dium, and a man's reputation as his mo&s;t va|luable property.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">His &s;incerity was &s;uch as became his other virtues. He had the &s;tricte&s;t regard to truth, of which his whole life was only one in&s;tance. All little arts and &s;ini&s;ter practices, tho&s;e ingredients of worldly pru|dence, he di&s;dained. His per&s;everance in &s;o commendable a part, in whatever difficul|ties it might at fir&s;t involve him, in the end rai&s;ed his character above malice and envy, and gave him that weight and influence in every thing he undertook, which nothing but an approved &s;incerity can give.</P>
<P>Whatever his other virtues were, their lu&s;tre was greatly increa&s;ed by his humility. To conquer religious pride is one of the be&s;t effects of religion; an effect, which his re|ligion in the mo&s;t amiable manner pro|duced.</P>
<P>Thus far however he hath had many imi|tators. The principal recommendations of him, and the di&s;tingui&s;hing parts of his cha|racter were his con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the duties of a clergyman, his exten&s;ive benevo|lence, and his exalted piety.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;charge of his function, no man could be more &s;trongly influenced by
<PB N="227" REF="229">what he thought the duties of it. The mo|tives of convenience, or pre&s;ent intere&s;t had no kind of weight with him. As the in|come was no part of his concern, he only con&s;idered the office; which he thought &s;uch a charge as a man would rather dread than &s;olicit: but when providence called him to it (for what was not procured by any endeavours of his own he could not but a&s;|cribe to providence) he accepted it, though with reluctance. He then &s;hewed, that if a &s;en&s;e of the importance of his office made him di&s;tru&s;t his abilities, it made him mo&s;t diligent in exerting them. As &s;oon as ever he undertook the care of a pari&s;h, it imme|diately engro&s;&s;ed his whole attention. The plea&s;ures of life he totally relinqui&s;hed, even his favourite pur&s;uits of learning. This was the more commendable in him, as he had always a &s;trong inclination for retirement, and was often violently tempted to &s;hut him|&s;elf up in &s;ome univer&s;ity at home or abroad, and live there &s;eque&s;tered from the world. But his con&s;cience corrected his inclination; as he thought the life of a mere reclu&s;e by no means agreeable to the active principles
<PB N="228" REF="230">of chri&s;tianity. Nay, the very repo&s;e to which his age laid claim, he would not in|dulge; but, as long as he had &s;trength &s;uf|ficient, per&s;evered in the laborious practice of &s;uch methods of in&s;truction, as he ima|gined might mo&s;t benefit tho&s;e under his care.&mdash;Of popular applau&s;e he was quite regardle&s;s, &s;o far as mere reputation was concerned: but as the favour of the multi|tude was one &s;tep towards gaining their at|tention, in that light he valued it. He re|proved vice, wherever he ob&s;erved it, with the utmo&s;t freedom. As he was contented in his &s;tation, and &s;uperior to all dependence, he avoided the danger of being tempted to any unbecoming compliance: and whether he reproved in public or private, his un|blameable life, and the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which he &s;poke, gave an irre&s;i&s;tible weight to what he &s;aid. He &s;tudied the low capacities of the people among whom he lived, and knew how to adapt his arguments to their appre|hen&s;ions. Hence the effects that his preach|ing had upon them are &s;aid to have been often very &s;urpri&s;ing. In particular it is re|lated, that as he was once recommending
<PB N="229" REF="231">hone&s;ty in a part of the country notoriou&s;ly addicted to thieving, a man &s;truck with the warmth and earne&s;tne&s;s with which he &s;poke, &s;tood up in the mid&s;t of a large congregation, and freely confe&s;&s;ed his di&s;hone&s;ty, and how heartily he repented of it.</P>
<P>With regard to his benevolence, never certainly had any man more di&s;intere&s;ted views, or made the common good more the &s;tudy of his life, which was indeed the be&s;t comment upon the great chri&s;tian principle of univer&s;al charity. He called nothing his own: there was nothing he could not rea|dily part with for the &s;ervice of others. In his charitable di&s;tributions he had no mea|&s;ure but the bounds of his income, of which the lea&s;t portion was always laid out on him|&s;elf. Nor did he give as if he was grant|ing a favour, but as if he was paying a debt: all ob&s;equious &s;ervice the genero&s;ity of his heart di&s;dained. He was the more particularly careful to give away in his life|time whatever he could &s;ave for the poor, as he had often &s;een and regretted the abu&s;e of po&s;thumous charities. <Q>It is my de&s;ign, at my departure, (&s;ays he, writing to a friend)
<PB N="230" REF="232">to leave no more behind me, but to bury me, and pay my debts.</Q> What little he did leave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are a few extracts from his will, which perhaps may not be unacceptable to the reader.</P>

<P>As to the word more, in the third line, we will rather &s;uppo&s;e the poet made u&s;e of it for want of another rhime, than through any di&s;re&s;pect to the memory of Mr. Gilpin.</P>
<P>Whatever becomes of the notion of the metemp&s;y|cho&s;is, one would imagine however that Mr. Gilpin's example at lea&s;t had its influence upon the rectors of Houghton; for perhaps few pari&s;hes in England can boa&s;t &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of worthy pa&s;tors, as that pari&s;h can &s;ince Mr. Gilpin's death.</P>

<P><PB N="234" REF="236">But no part of his character was more con&s;picuous than his piety. It hath been largely &s;hewn with what temper, &s;incerity, and earne&s;tne&s;s, he examined the contro|verted points of religion, and &s;ettled his own per&s;ua&s;ion. He thought religion his prin|cipal concern; and of cour&s;e made the at|tainment of ju&s;t notions in it his principal &s;tudy. To what was matter of mere &s;pecu|lation he paid no regard: &s;uch opinions as influenced practice he thought only concern|ed him. He knew no other end of religion but an holy life; and therefore in all his en|quiries about it, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as looking after truths which were to influence
<PB N="235" REF="237">his future conduct, and make him a better man. Accordingly, when his religious per|&s;ua&s;ion was once &s;ettled, he made the doc|trines he embraced the invariable rule of his life: all his moral virtues became chri&s;tian ones; were formed upon &s;uch motives, and re&s;pected &s;uch ends, as chri&s;tianity recom|mended. It was his daily care to conform him&s;elf to the will of God; upon who&s;e providence he ab&s;olutely depended in all conditions of life; re&s;igned, ea&s;y, and chear|ful under what&s;oever commonly reputed mis|fortunes he might meet with. He had &s;ome peculiar, though, it may be, ju&s;t notions with regard to a particular providence. He thought all misfortunes, which our own in|di&s;cretions did not immediately draw upon us, were &s;ent directly from God, to bring us to a &s;en&s;e of our mi&s;behaviour, and quicken us in a virtuous cour&s;e; accordingly at &s;uch times he u&s;ed with more than ordinary at|tention to examine his pa&s;t conduct, and en|deavour to find out in what point of duty he had been defective.</P>
<P>To the opinions of others, however dif|ferent from his own, he was mo&s;t indul|gent.
<PB N="236" REF="238">He thought moderation one of the mo&s;t genuine effects of true piety. It hath already appeared from his intercour&s;e with the di&s;&s;enters, how great an enemy he was to all intolerant principles; how wrong he thought it on one hand to oppo&s;e an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church, and on the other to mole&s;t a quiet &s;eparati&s;t.</P>
<P>His life was wholly guided by a con&s;cience the mo&s;t religiou&s;ly &s;crupulous. I cannot forbear in&s;erting an in&s;tance of its extreme &s;en&s;ibility, though it may be thought per|haps rather &s;uper&s;titious. He had behaved in &s;ome particular, with regard to his pa|ri&s;h, in a manner which gave him great concern. His con&s;cience was &s;o much alarmed at what he had done, that nothing he was able to allege to him&s;elf in his ex|cu&s;e was able to make him ea&s;y. At length he determined to lay open the whole ca&s;e before the bi&s;hop of Durham, his dio|ce&s;an, and to &s;urrender up his living, or &s;ubmit to any cen&s;ure, which the bi&s;hop might think his fault de&s;erved. Without thus bringing him&s;elf to ju&s;tice, he &s;aid,
<PB N="237" REF="239">he never could have recovered his peace of mind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His letter upon this occa&s;ion to the bi&s;hop is not extant, nor doth it appear what the fault was: the fol|lowing letter relates to it.</P>
<Q>Grace and peace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: if any man be vexed in body or mind, you know it is a very grievous thing to have no comforter: which hath con&s;trained me to di&s;clo&s;e unto you (not doubting but to have both your comfort and help, and to have it kept mo&s;t &s;ecret) that thing, which, be&s;ides to you, I never opened to any living creature. In this inclo&s;ed letter I have opened my grief and weakne&s;s of con&s;cience unto my lord; be&s;eeching you, if opportunity will &s;erve, to de|liver it. Howbeit, if either he &s;hould be pained with &s;ickne&s;s, or you would fir&s;t by writing that I &s;hould have your advice, or you &s;ee any other cau&s;e why to &s;tay the delivery, I refer all to your wi&s;dom. But if you have opportunity to my lord, I hope by you to know &s;peedily &s;ome part of his plea&s;ure. I tru&s;t, my ca&s;e weighed, he will rather think me to be pitied than had in hatred. How tender a thing con&s;cience is, I have found by too good experience. I have found moreover, that as it is ea&s;ily wounded, &s;o it is with difficulty healed. And for my own part, I &s;peak from my heart, I would rather be often wounded in my body, than once in my mind. Which things con&s;i|dered, I tru&s;t you will bear with my weakne&s;s. But you may object, I have continued weak very long; which fault certainly I find with my&s;elf: but for this I accu&s;e my own &s;lowne&s;s both in &s;tudy and prayer; which by God's grace, as far as my weak body will &s;erve, hereafter &s;hall be amended: for certainly tho&s;e two are the chief in&s;truments, whereby I have &s;ure tru&s;t that God of his goodne&s;s will make me &s;trong.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240">Such was the life and character of this excellent man. A conduct &s;o agreeable to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of morality and religion gained him among his contemporaries the title of the Northern Apo&s;tle. And indeed the parallel was &s;triking; his quitting the corrupt doctrines, in the utmo&s;t. reverence of which he had been educated; the per&s;ecu|tions he met with for the &s;ake of his integri|ty; the danger he often ran of martyrdom; his contempt of the world; his unwearied application to the bu&s;ine&s;s of his calling; and the boldne&s;s and freedom with which he re|proved the guilty, whatever their fortunes or &s;tations were, might ju&s;tly characterize him a truly apo&s;tolical per&s;on.</P>

<BIBL>St. LUKE II. Ver. 41,&mdash;50.</BIBL>
<Q>Now his parents went to Jeru&s;alem every year, at the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over. And when he was twelve years old, and they were come up to Jeru&s;alem, after the cu&s;tom of the fea&s;t, and had fini&s;hed the days thereof; as they returned, the child Je&s;us remained in Jeru&s;alem; and Jo|&s;eph knew not of it, nor his mother. But they, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had been in the company, went a day's journey; and &s;ought him among&s;t their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back to Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ought him. And it came to pa&s;s, three days after, that they found him in the temple, &s;itting in the mid&s;t of the doctors; both hearing them and a&s;king them que&s;tions. And all that heard him were a&s;toni&s;hed at his under&s;tand|ing and an&s;wers. So when they &s;aw
<PB N="246" REF="245">him, they were amazed: and his mo|ther &s;aid unto him, Son, why ha&s;t thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have &s;ought thee with heavy hearts. Then &s;aid he unto them, How is it that ye &s;ought me? Know ye not that I mu&s;t go about my father's bu&s;ine&s;s? But they under&s;tood not the word that he &s;pake unto them.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOra&s;much as the whole go&s;pel is more full of matter, and plenteous in my&s;|teries, than that it can well be di&s;cu&s;&s;|ed within the limits of one &s;ermon, I have taken, for this time, to treat upon this one &s;entence &s;poken by Chri&s;t unto his parents, <Q>Know ye not that I mu&s;t go about my fa|ther's bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q> being content to omit the re&s;t; taking only &s;o much as &s;hall &s;uffice to declare the occa&s;ion whereupon he &s;pake the&s;e words, for the fuller under&s;tanding of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Ye &s;hall therefore under&s;tand, that when our Saviour was come to the age of twelve years, giving attendance upon his parents to Jeru&s;alem, at the &s;olemn fea&s;t of ea&s;ter, whi|ther
<PB N="247" REF="246">they yearly did repair at that time of &s;incere devotion, and for the obedience of the law; after that Jo&s;eph and Mary had devoutly pa&s;&s;ed the days of the fea&s;t, and were returned home, it came to pa&s;s, (not through blind fortune, but by God's provi|dence, that his glory might appear) that the ble&s;&s;ed &s;on Je&s;us tarried behind at Jeru&s;alem; and while his parents, either not taking good heed of him, or el&s;e going apart in &s;undry companies, either of them tru&s;ting he had been with the other, they went one day's journey before they miffed him: but after he was found wanting, they &s;ought him dili|gently among their kinsfolk and acquain|tance, but found him not; which was un|doubtedly unto them a very cro&s;s of bitter affliction. So doth God many times exerci&s;e his elect and cho&s;en with adver&s;ity, for their trial, and to keep them in humility. When they were returned to Jeru&s;alem, and had long &s;ought him with &s;orrowful hearts, after three days they found him in the temple.</P>
<P>Here then, by the way, methinks the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth us this &s;piritual doctrine: &s;o
<PB N="248" REF="247">long as we &s;eek Chri&s;t in our own kinsfolk, that is, our own inventions and devices, we find him not; but to find Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t accompany the&s;e godly per&s;ons, Jo&s;eph and Mary, unto the temple of his holy word; there Chri&s;t is found unto &s;o many as &s;eek him, with &s;uch humble &s;pirits and meek hearts as Jo&s;eph and Mary did. They found him in the temple, not idly occupied as many are, not mumbling things he under|&s;tood not, &s;ine mente &s;onum, a confu&s;ed &s;ound without knowledge; but they found him occupied in his heavenly father's bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as all men &s;hould be in the temple, ei|ther in &s;peaking to God by humble and hearty prayer, or hearing God &s;peaking to them in his mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed word. So was Chri&s;t occupied among&s;t learned men, and oppo&s;ing them. Where he teacheth us, to be always as glad to learn as to teach. It is a probable conjecture, that he opened to them the &s;criptures which &s;pake of Me&s;&s;ias, a mat|ter then in controver&s;y. But what&s;oever their matter was, the evangeli&s;t &s;aith, <Q>he made them all a&s;toni&s;hed at his under&s;tanding
<PB N="249" REF="248">and an&s;wers.</Q> So the glory of his godhead even then began to &s;hine. Where we may mark the wonderful power of the go&s;pel: even the hard-hearted that will not receive it, the bright beams of the truth &s;hining therein maketh a&s;toni&s;hed. It cau&s;eth al&s;o the godly to marvel, as Mary and Jo&s;eph; but their admiration always ended with joy.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding his heavenly maje&s;ty made all men to wonder, his mother thought &s;he had &s;ome cau&s;e to expo&s;tulate with him for the great fear he had brought upon them, ca&s;ting them into a dungeon of &s;orrows; and complaining, &s;aid, 'Son, why ha&s;t thou,' &amp;c. She &s;eemed to charge him with the breach of the fir&s;t precept of the &s;econd table, that he had not well intreated his parents. But Chri&s;t &s;o &s;haped this an&s;wer, that he taketh away all her complaint; teaching us, how the precepts of the &s;econd table may not be under&s;tood in any wi&s;e to be a hindrance to the fir&s;t. <Q>Wi&s;t ye not that I mu&s;t go about my father's bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q> Where our duty and &s;ervice to God cometh in place, all hu|man
<PB N="250" REF="249">&s;ervice and obedience, which might be a hindrance thereto, to whom&s;oever it be, father or mother, king or Ce&s;ar, mu&s;t &s;tand back and give place. Be&s;ides this, he teach|eth us here a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary le&s;&s;on for all men to know and bear away, which is, that his whole life and death was nothing el&s;e but a perfect obedience to the will of his hea|venly father, and that he was always mo&s;t bu&s;ily occupied therein: and teacheth us, that if we look by adoption to be brethren and co|heirs with Chri&s;t of his father's kingdom, we mu&s;t al&s;o with our ma&s;ter and lord yield up our&s;elves wholly to our heavenly father's will, and always be occupied in his bu&s;ine&s;s. <Q>I have given you an example, that ye &s;hould do even as I have done to you.</Q> Which le&s;&s;on being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary of all Chri&s;tians to be kept, and the breach thereof the cau&s;e of all iniquity, I thought it good to pa&s;s over other places of gho&s;tly in&s;truction which this go&s;pel might mini&s;ter, and to tarry upon this one &s;entence, <Q>Know ye not that I mu&s;t go about my father's bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q> Intending to &s;hew in order, how all e&s;tates of men, the

<P>AFTER that our fir&s;t parents, through di&s;obedience and &s;in, had blotted and disfigured the lively image of God, where|unto they were created, and might have liv|ed alway in a conformity to the will of God; man was never able to apply him&s;elf to God his father's bu&s;ine&s;s, nor yet &s;o much as to know what appertained thereto. <Q>The na|tural man, &s;aith St. Paul, perceiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God,</Q> till Chri&s;t, the very true image of God the father, did come down, and took man's nature upon him; which de&s;cent, as he declareth, was to fulfil for us the will of his father, that <Q>like as by di&s;obedience of one man, many were made &s;inners; &s;o by the obedience of one (Chri&s;t) many might be made righte|ous, what time as he became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s.</Q> Which obedience, le&s;t carnal men &s;hould challenge to &s;uffice for them, how&s;oever their life be a continual rebellion again&s;t God and his holy
<PB N="253" REF="252">will, &s;uch as there be a great number, and have been in all ages, St. Paul wipeth them clean away, &s;aying, <Q>Chri&s;t hath become &s;alvation, not to all, but to all that obey him.</Q> Let no man therefore flatter and deceive him&s;elf. If we will challenge the name of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, if we will wor|thily po&s;&s;e&s;s the glorious name of Chri&s;tians, we mu&s;t learn this le&s;&s;on of our ma&s;ter, to be occupied in our heavenly father's bu&s;ine&s;s; which is, to fly our own will, which is a wicked and wanton will, and wholly to con|form our&s;elves to his will, &s;aying, as we are taught, 'thy will be done;' which, as St. Augu&s;tine &s;aith, <Q>the fle&s;hly man, the co|vetous, adulterous, ravenous, or deceitful man, can never &s;ay, but with his lips, be|cau&s;e in his heart he preferreth his own cur&s;ed will, &s;etting a&s;ide the will of God.</Q></P>
<P>Now for&s;omuch as the greate&s;t part of the world hath at this day for&s;aken their father's bu&s;ine&s;s, applying their own, and are altoge|ther drowned in &s;in; for, <Q>the whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart is heavy: from the &s;ole of the foot to the head.
<PB N="254" REF="253">there is nothing whole therein,</Q> and as St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>all &s;eek their own, and not that which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t's;</Q> and as I am here a&s;cended into the high hill of Sion, the high|e&s;t hill in all this realm, I mu&s;t needs, as it is given me in commi&s;&s;ion, <Q>cry aloud and &s;pare not; lift up my voice like a trumpet, and &s;hew the people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</Q> I mu&s;t cry unto all e&s;tates, as well of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical mini&s;try, as of the civil governance, with the vulgar people.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as example of holy &s;crip|tures, with experience of Chri&s;t's church in all ages, hath taught us that the fall of prie&s;ts is the fall of the people; and contrariwi&s;e, the integrity of them is the pre&s;ervation of the whole flock; and the mini&s;ters, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, being <Q>the light of his my&s;tical body, if the light be turned into darkne&s;s, there mu&s;t needs follow great darkne&s;s in the whole body;</Q> I think it fit to begin with them, who &s;eem to have brought blind|ne&s;s into the whole body, making men to forget their heavenly father's bu&s;ine&s;s: they which &s;hould have kept the candle &s;till burn|ing, the&s;e will I chiefly examine in that
<PB N="255" REF="254">bu&s;ine&s;e which Chri&s;t &s;o earne&s;tly committed to all pa&s;tors before his a&s;cen&s;ion, when he demanded thrice of Peter if he loved him; and every time upon Peter's confe&s;&s;ion, en|joined him &s;traightly to feed his lambs and &s;heep: wherein we have the true trial of all mini&s;ters who love Chri&s;t, and apply his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider how it hath been forgot|ten in the church many years, it might make a Chri&s;tian's heart to bleed. He that wrote the general chronicle of ages, when he com|eth to the time of John VIII. and Martin II. bi&s;hops of Rome about &s;ix hundred years ago, conferring the golden ages going before, with the iniquity of that time, when through ambition, avarice, and contention, the office of &s;etting forth God's word was brought to an utter contempt, and trodden under foot, in token whereof the bible was made the bi|&s;hop's foot&s;tool, he falleth to a &s;udden excla|mation, and complaineth thus with the la|mentable voice of the prophet Jeremy, <Q>O lord God, how is the gold become &s;o dim? How is the goodly colour of it &s;o changed? O mo&s;t ungracious time, &s;aith he, where|in
<PB N="256" REF="255">the holy man faileth, or is not. All truths are dimini&s;hed from the &s;ons of men: there are no godly men left: the faithful are worn out among the children of men.</Q> In that time, as it appeared both by this hi&s;tory and others, ambition and greedy avarice had taught mini&s;ters to &s;eek and contend for livings, who might climb the highe&s;t by utter contempt of their office, and our heavenly father's bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;o to make Chri&s;t's flock a ready prey for the devil, <Q>who goeth about like a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</Q></P>
<P>Then the bi&s;hop of Rome, abu&s;ing always Peter's keys to &s;ill Judas's fatchels, di&s;pen&s;ed with all prelates that brought any money in obeying Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion given to Peter, 'Feed, feed my lambs and my &s;heep;' and &s;tretched it &s;o largely, that in&s;tead of feeding Chri&s;t's lambs and &s;heep, he allowed them to feed hawks, hounds, and hor&s;es, I will not &s;ay harlots, Then, in&s;tead of fi&s;hers of men, he made them to become fi&s;hers of benefices and fat livings. He brought preaching into &s;uch a contempt, that it was accounted a
<PB N="257" REF="256">great ab&s;urdity for a cardinal to preach, after he had once be&s;trid his mule.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee after, how this evil increa&s;ed. St. Bernard in his time, about two hundred years after, lamented that when open per&s;e|cution of tyrants and heretics was cea&s;ed in the church, then another per&s;ecution, far wor&s;e, and more noi&s;ome to Chri&s;t's go&s;pel, did &s;ucceed; when the mini&s;ters, Chri&s;t's own friends by pretence, were turned into per&s;ecutors. <Q>My lovers and my kin&s;men &s;tand a&s;ide from my plague: and my kin&s;|men &s;tand afar off.</Q> The iniquity of the church, &s;aith Bernard, began at the elders. <Q>Alas, alas, O lord God, they are the fore|mo&s;t in per&s;ecuting of thee, which are thought to love the chiefe&s;t place or pre|eminence in the church.</Q> This complaint, with much more too long to be rehear&s;ed, again&s;t the prelates of Rome, made St. Ber|nard in his time nothing afraid in the &s;ame place to call them antichri&s;ts; and for mur|dering of &s;illy &s;ouls, redeemed with Chri&s;t's precious blood, he maketh them more cruel per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;t, than the Jews which &s;hed his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257">If the iniquity of Rome, four hundred years ago, was &s;o great, and &s;ince hath not a little increa&s;ed, it was high time that God &s;hould open the eyes of &s;ome chri&s;tian prin|ces, to &s;ee the great abu&s;es and enormities of Romi&s;h bi&s;hops, and to deliver Chri&s;t's go&s;pel out of captivity, and to bring down his horns, who&s;e pride, if he might have had &s;ucce&s;s in his tyranny, began to a&s;cend with Lucifer above the &s;tars.</P>
<P>It is not many years ago, that a champion of theirs, named Pelagius, writing again&s;t Mar&s;ilius Paduanus in defence of Rome, hath not been a&s;hamed to leave in writing, that the pope (quodammodo, after a &s;ort) doth participate both natures, the godhead and manhood, with Chri&s;t; and that he may not be judged of the emperor, becau&s;e he is not a meer man, but as a God upon earth; and God, &s;aith he, may not be judged of man. What intolerable bla&s;phemy is this? If I had not read it my&s;elf, I could &s;carcely believe any &s;uch bla&s;phemy to proceed from him which profe&s;&s;eth Chri&s;t. Do you not perceive plainly the hi&s;&s;ing and poi&s;on of the old &s;erpent, when he tempted our fir&s;t pa|rents,

<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, What &s;hould we &s;peak &s;o much of the bi&s;hop of Rome? Is he not gone? His power taken away? If preach|ers would let him alone, the people would &s;oon forget him. Truly, for my part, if I had that gift, &s;trength, and calling, I had rather (though I were &s;ure to &s;mart there|fore) &s;peak again&s;t his enormities in Rome, than to &s;peak of them here: and I think no man beareth, at lea&s;t I am &s;ure no man ought to bear, any malice or evil again&s;t his per&s;on, in &s;peaking again&s;t his vice and ini|quity: <Q>We fight not, &s;aith St. Paul, again&s;t fle&s;h and blood; but we fight again&s;t the prince of darkne&s;s,</Q> &amp;c. When any wick|ed man, adver&s;ary to God and his word, a&s;&s;aileth us, we mu&s;t take him for no other but as an in&s;trument of the devil, and Satan him&s;elf to be our enemy, and none other: and even as when an enemy a&s;&s;aileth us on
<PB N="260" REF="259">hor&s;eback, we wi&s;h to overthrow the enemy and win the hor&s;e, which may be profitable to us; &s;o if the devil could be ca&s;t out of &s;uch in&s;truments as he hath in Rome, the men would become profitable members of Chri&s;t. But if the devil &s;it &s;o fa&s;t in the &s;addle, that he cannot be turned out, we cannot amend it. Yet our duty is, to pray unto God for them; and to hate none of God's creatures, but rather that which Satan hath depraved, <Q>if peradventure God will turn their hearts.</Q></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding, their faults ought to be chiefly told them in their pre&s;ence; yet not there only, but even here among&s;t us al&s;o. Although it come not to their ears, it is not a little expedient oftentimes to cry and thunder again&s;t their errors and vices; chiefly, that &s;o oft as we hear it, we may give God thanks, as we are mo&s;t bounden, for our de|liverance from that captivity of Babylon, as St. Peter him&s;elf, by the mind of antient writers, called it. Examples hereof we have in the &s;criptures: the &s;ong of the I&s;raelites, after their deliverance out of Egypt; and af|terwards, when they were delivered by De|bora
<PB N="261" REF="260">from the tyranny of Si&s;era; and after the deliverance from Holofernes by Judith. We mu&s;t be thankful, le&s;t for our unthankful|ne&s;s God &s;uffer us to fall into a wor&s;e bon|dage than ever we were in.&mdash;But mo&s;t of all it is profitable, that we may from our hearts renounce with Babylon all the vices of Baby|lon. For what did profit the deliverance out of Egypt, to tho&s;e that did &s;till carry Egypt in their minds through the de&s;art? What did it avail the deliverance out of Babylon, to tho&s;e that did bring Babylon home to Je|ru&s;alem? I fear me, yet in England a great many, like fle&s;hly I&s;raelites, are weary of the &s;weet manna of the go&s;pel, and &s;avour of the fle&s;hly Egypt, de&s;iring to live &s;till under the bondage of Pharaoh.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t of all it is expedient now for my purpo&s;e to &s;peak of that &s;ea, from whence, &s;o far as ever I could learn, tho&s;e intolerable abu&s;es have overflown, and are come among us; which as yet are great enemies to Chri&s;t's go&s;pel here in England, making his mini&s;ters to &s;et a&s;ide his bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;uch abu&s;es as can|not yet be driven away, nor &s;ent home to Rome to their father: I mean di&s;pen&s;ations
<PB N="262" REF="261">for pluralities, and totquots, with di&s;pen&s;a|tions for non-re&s;idents, which avarice and idlene&s;s tran&s;ported hither from Rome.

<P>And becau&s;e they are accounted to &s;tand by law, they are u&s;ed as cloaks for iniquity. The&s;e may well be likened unto tho&s;e fatlings which Saul, again&s;t God's commandment, did keep alive when he vanqui&s;hed the Ama|lekites. And truly, till there be ordained &s;ome godly laws to bani&s;h the&s;e, with other abu&s;es, God's wrath is kindled again&s;t us to de&s;troy all &s;uch as are maintainers of them. So long as it &s;hall be lawful for men to have &s;o many livings as they can get, and di&s;|charge never a one; and &s;o long as men may have livings to lie where they will in idlene&s;s, far from their cure, fatting them|&s;elves like the devil's porklings, and letting a thou&s;and &s;ouls peri&s;h for lack of &s;piritual food, God's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall never be well ap|plied, nor his go&s;pel have &s;ucce&s;s in Eng|land.</P>

I will only declare, which methinks might &s;uffice if there were no more, how the &s;cripture maketh them mo&s;t cruel murtherers, and guilty of blood. In the thirty-fourth of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus it is written, <Q>The bread of the needful is the life of the poor; he that defraudeth them thereof is a man of blood.</Q> If this &s;en|tence be true in them that defraud the needy of their corporal food, how much more are they which withhold the food of the &s;oul, being the worthier part of man, guilty of blood? And therefore God, by his prophet Ezekiel, telleth them, <Q>So many as peri&s;h by their negligence, their blood &s;hall be
<PB N="265" REF="264">required at their hands, as men guilty of blood.</Q> Now let them con&s;ider, that if the blood of Abel, one man, cried up unto heaven for vengeance again&s;t Cain, what an horrible cry &s;hall the blood of a thou&s;and &s;ouls make before the throne of God, a&s;king vengeance again&s;t that wicked pa&s;tor, which mo&s;t cruelly hath hungred them to death, in withholding from them the food of life? The gold they lay up yearly, brought far off by farmers; their rings and jewels; their fine apparel; their beds they lie on; their meat and drink, being the &s;poil of the poor; cry all for vengeance: the &s;tones in the wall, the timber over their heads, cry for ven|geance.</P>

They call upon you to expel and drive away the great drones, which in idlene&s;s devour other mens labour; that after St. Paul's rule, <Q>He that will not labour, be not &s;uffered to eat. The little ones have a&s;ked bread, &amp;c.</Q> Chri&s;t's little ones have hungred and called for the food of the go&s;pel a long time, and none there was to give it them. Now they
<PB N="268" REF="267">cry unto you, take heed you turn not your ears from them, le&s;t their blood be required at your hands al&s;o, and le&s;t God turn his ears from you. Samuel &s;pake unto Saul fearful words, <Q>Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t ca&s;t away the word of the Lord, the Lord hath therefore ca&s;t away thee from being king.</Q> You are made of God a pa&s;tor, a pa&s;tor of pa&s;tors.

The eye of the ma&s;ter hath great &s;trength. Your grace's eye to look through your realm, and &s;ee that watchmen &s;leep not, &s;hall be worth a great number of preachers. They call unto you to awake not only negligent pa&s;tors, but al&s;o to take away other enormities, which have followed in heaps upon tho&s;e evils, plurali|ties and non-re&s;idents.</P>
<P>If I might have time, I think I &s;hould be able to prove, that the great &s;warm of evils which reign at this day, have flowed from tho&s;e fountains, or rather puddles. But I will only &s;peak of the great abu&s;es which by
<PB N="269" REF="268">&s;poil or robbery do hide the go&s;pel, how they have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of non-re&s;i|dents have brought forth farming of bene|fices to gentlemen, laymen, wherein they have found &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s and worldly wealth, that preachers cannot have them, they will be perpetual farmers; which hath opened a gap for the heathen, as David &s;aith, or el&s;e for cloaked chri&s;tians, much wor&s;e than the heathen, who have entered into Chri&s;t's inheritance, &s;poiled his holy temple, and robbed his go&s;pel. Such &s;eem to make compo&s;ition with our great enemy Satan: the idle pa&s;tor &s;aying, Give to me riches, take the re&s;t to thy &s;hare; whom Satan an&s;wer|eth, If thou wilt betray to me the &s;ouls, take riches for thy part.</P>
<P>Another gap hath been opened, for that the learned have not done their duties, no more than the unlearned; hereby Chri&s;t's vineyard hath been urterly &s;poiled. Patrons &s;ee that none do their duty. They think as good to put in a&s;&s;es as men. The bi&s;hops were never &s;o liberal in making of lewd prie&s;ts; but they are as liberal in making
<PB N="270" REF="269">lewd vicars. I dare &s;ay, if &s;uch a mon&s;ter as Dervell Gatherel, the idol of Wales, burnt in Smithfield, &s;hould have &s;et his hand to a bill to let the patron take the greate&s;t part of the profits, he might have had a benefice. There is never any que&s;tion how he can oc|cupy him&s;elf in God's bu&s;ine&s;s. John Ger|&s;on, a learned man in his time, witne&s;&s;eth, that who&s;oever in that time was admitted to a benefice in France, mu&s;t an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, Scis utrumque te&s;tamentum? Know|e&s;t thou the old te&s;tament and the new? And the ignorant was put back. But with the&s;e men, it &s;killeth not if he never opened the bible, &s;o much the meeter for their purpo&s;e, as he is not able to &s;peak again&s;t their ab&s;u&s;es, but will &s;uffer them to &s;leep in their &s;in.&mdash;And will you &s;ee what prepo&s;terous judg|ment they u&s;e? For all worldly offices they &s;earch meet and convenient men; only chri&s;|tian &s;ouls, &s;o dearly bought, are committed without re&s;pect, to men not worthy to keep &s;heep.</P>
<P>Your grace hath &s;ent forth &s;urveyors, as mo&s;t needful it was, to &s;ee there &s;hould be no deceit in payment of pen&s;ions, and other
<PB N="271" REF="270">offices abroad: would to God you would al&s;o &s;end forth &s;urveyors to &s;ee how benefices are be&s;towed and u&s;ed; how Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel are robbed and di&s;honoured, to the great decay of your realm and common|wealth: you &s;hould find a &s;mall number of patrons that be&s;tow rightly their livings, &s;eek|ing God's glory, and that his work and bu&s;i|ne&s;s may be rightly applied, without &s;imony, or &s;eeking their own profit.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, it is almo&s;t general, to re&s;erve the farming to him&s;elf, or his friend; and to appoint the rent at his own plea&s;ure.&mdash;But wor&s;e than this, a great number never farm them at all, but keep them as their own lands, and give &s;ome three-halfpenny prie&s;t a cu|rate's wages, nine or ten pounds. Even as Jeroboam made prie&s;ts of his own for his hill-altars, to &s;acrifice to his calves, that the people &s;hould not go up to Jeru&s;alem. The&s;e Jeroboams will never let the people a&s;cend to Jeru&s;alem, to find Chri&s;t in the temple of his word. They began fir&s;t with par&s;onages, and &s;eemed to have &s;ome con&s;cience towards vicarages; but now their hearts be &s;o har|dened, all is fi&s;h that cometh to the net.
<PB N="272" REF="271">Gentlemen are par&s;ons and vicars both, no|thing can e&s;cape them. There be vicarages about London, having a thou&s;and people, &s;o &s;poiled; whereby it may appear what is done further off.&mdash;Your grace may find al&s;o, where gentlemen keep in their hands livings of forty or fifty pounds, and give one that never cometh there five or &s;ix pounds. Some change the ground of the benefice with their tenants, to the intent, if it be called for, the tenant &s;hall lo&s;e it and not they. Is not this a godly patron?&mdash;It &s;hall appear al&s;o, I could name the place, where a living of an hun|dred marks by the year, if I &s;ay not pounds, hath been &s;old for many years, I &s;uppo&s;e an hundred &s;ave one, and &s;o continueth &s;till.&mdash;O good St. Ambro&s;e, if thou had&s;t been bi|&s;hop there, thou would&s;t never have &s;uffered &s;uch wolves to devour the flock. It may well be called a devouring; for this living in a godly learned pa&s;tor's hand might have re|fre&s;hed five hundred in a year with gho&s;tly food, and all the country about with God's word; which, as I perceive, in twenty miles compa&s;s hath &s;carce one man to preach; and yet no place in England more needful, for

Certainly I marvel that God holdeth his hand, that he de&s;troyeth them not with Nadab and Abihu. Let them not abu&s;e God's patience; for if they do not &s;hortly repent, and be&s;tow their livings better, both ma&s;ter and man &s;hall burn in hell-fire.</P>
<P>I am not able to rehear&s;e, nor yet any man knoweth all the abu&s;es which the &s;imoniacs, ambitious and idle pa&s;tors, have brought unto your realm; by who&s;e evil example ravenous wolves, painted chri&s;tians, hypo|crites, have entered and defiled the &s;anctuary, &s;poiled Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, to the de&s;truc|tion of his flock.

Come to the mini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, &s;et forth now by common au|thority after the fir&s;t in&s;titution. They think bapti&s;m is not effectual, becau&s;e it wanteth man's tradition. They are not taught how the apo&s;tles baptized. A great number think it is a great offence to take the &s;acrament of Chri&s;t's body in their hands, that have no con&s;cience to receive it with bla&s;phemous mouths, with malicious hearts, full of all uncleanne&s;s. The&s;e come to it by threes of cu&s;tom, without any &s;piritual hunger, and know not the end wherefore it was in&s;tituted. They come to the church to feed their eyes, and not their &s;ouls; they are not taught that no vi&s;ible thing is to be wor&s;hipped; and for becau&s;e they &s;ee not in the church the &s;hining pomp and plea&s;ing variety (as they thought it) of painted cloths, candle&s;tics, images, altars, lamps, and tapers, they &s;ay, as good to go into a barn; nothing e&s;teem|ing Chri&s;t which &s;peaketh to them in his
<PB N="275" REF="274">holy word, neither his holy &s;acrament re|duced to the fir&s;t in&s;titution. To be &s;hort, the people are now, even as the Jews were at Chri&s;t's coming, altogether occupied in external holine&s;s and culture, without any feeling of true holine&s;s, or of the true wor|&s;hip of God in &s;pirit and truth, without the which all other is meer hypocri&s;y. Many thou&s;ands know not what this meaneth; but &s;eek Chri&s;t &s;till among their kindred, in man's inventions, where they can never find him. As the Jews preferred man's tradi|tions before God's commandments, even &s;o it is now. Men think it a greater offence to break a fa&s;ting day, or work upon a &s;aint's day, than to ab&s;tain from profitable labour, and turn it to Bacchus's fea&s;ts, exerci&s;ing more ungodline&s;s that day than all the week, de&s;pi&s;ing or &s;oon weary of God's word.&mdash;All this, with much more, cometh through lack of preaching, as experience trieth where godly pa&s;tors be.&mdash;It cannot much be mar|velled, if the &s;imple and ignorant people, by &s;ome wicked heads and firebrands of hell, be &s;ometimes &s;educed to rebel again&s;t their prince and lawful magi&s;trates, &s;eeing they
<PB N="276" REF="275">are never taught to know their obedience and duty to their king and &s;overeign, &s;o &s;traitly commanded in God's law.</P>
<P>But there hangeth over us a great evil, if your grace do not help it in time; the devil goeth about by the&s;e cormorants that devour the&s;e livings appointed for the go&s;pel, to make a &s;ortre&s;s and bulwark to keep learn|ed pa&s;tors from the flock; that is, &s;o to de|cay learning, that there &s;hall be none learn|ed to commit the flock unto. For by rea&s;on livings appointed for the mini&s;try, for the mo&s;t part are either robbed of the be&s;t part, or clean taken away; almo&s;t none have any zeal or devotion to put their children to &s;chool, but to learn to write, to make them apprentices, or el&s;e to have them lawyers. Look upon the two wells of this realm, Ox|ford and Cambridge; they are almo&s;t dried up. The cruel Phili&s;tines abroad, enemies to Chri&s;t's go&s;pel, have &s;topped up the &s;prings of faithful Abraham. The decay of &s;tudents is &s;o great, there are &s;carce left of every thou|&s;and an hundred. If they decay &s;o fa&s;t in &s;even years more, there will be almo&s;t none at all; and then may the devil make a tri|umph.
<PB N="277" REF="276">This matter requireth &s;peedy redre&s;s.

<PB N="279" REF="278">the fir&s;t month, and &s;uffering them to have no cloak of ab&s;ence, you will &s;oon re|&s;tore the fir&s;t year's living, which in my con|&s;cience was wrongfully taken away at the fir&s;t, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by the bi&s;hop of Rome. But I doubt not, if all were well redre&s;&s;ed to this, that this al&s;o &s;hould &s;oon be amended. Wherefore, here I will de&s;ire God to a&s;&s;i&s;t your grace in the advancement of his go&s;pel, which, like unto Jo&s;ias, you have helped to bring to light where it lay hid.</P>
<P>But yet it is not heard of all your people. A thou&s;and pulpits in England are covered with du&s;t. Some have not had four &s;ermons the&s;e fifteen or &s;ixteen years, &s;ince friars left their limitations; and few of tho&s;e were wor|thy the name of &s;ervants. Now therefore, that your glory may be perfect, all mens ex|pectation is, that what&s;oever any flatterers, or enemies to God's word &s;hould labour to the contrary, for their own lucre; your grace will take away all &s;uch lets and abu&s;es, as hinder the &s;etting forth of God's mo&s;t holy word, and with&s;tand all &s;uch robbers, as &s;poil his &s;anctuary; travelling to &s;end pa&s;tors home to their flocks, to feed Chri&s;t's lambs and

<P>And thus far concerning the eccle&s;ia&s;tical mini&s;try.</P>
<P>But now to come to the civil governance, the nobility, magi&s;trates, and officers; all the&s;e mu&s;t at all times remember, <Q>they mu&s;t be occupied in their heavenly father's bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q> They have received all their nobility, power, dominion, authority, and offices of God; which are excellent and he|roical gifts: and if they be occupied in God's bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;hall redound to his glory, and the wealth of his people; but if they fall from his bu&s;ine&s;s, and follow their own will, or rather the will of Satan, the prince of darkne&s;s, and father of all the children of darkne&s;s, then &s;hall all the&s;e glorious titles turn them to names of confu&s;ion. For fall|ing unto ungodline&s;s, and framing them&s;elves to the &s;hape and fa&s;hion of this world, no|bility is turned into vile &s;lavery and bondage
<PB N="281" REF="280">of &s;in, power and dominion are turned into tyranny, authority is become a &s;word of mi&s;|chief in a madman's hand, all maje&s;ty and honour is turned into mi&s;ery, &s;hame, and confu&s;ion; and ever the higher men be, while they &s;erve &s;in, the more notable is their vice, and more pe&s;tiferous to infect by evi examples; becau&s;e all mens eyes are bent to behold their doings. <Q>Every fault of the mind is &s;o much more evident, as the party is more notable who hath it,</Q> &s;aith Juvenal. For the worthier the per&s;on is which offend|eth, the more his offence is noted of others; &s;eeing that virtue in all whom God hath ex|alted is the maintainer of their dignity, with|out the which they fall from it. It &s;hall be mo&s;t needful for them to embrace virtue, and chiefly humility, which is the keeper of all virtues; which may put them ever in re|membrance from whence power is given them, for what end, who is above them, a judge, an examiner of all their doings, who cannot be deceived. But as dignity goeth now a days, climb who may climb highe&s;t, every man exalteth him&s;elf, and tarrieth not the calling of God. Humility is taken for
<PB N="282" REF="281">no keeper, but for an utter enemy to nobility. As I heard of a wicked climber and exalter of him&s;elf, who hearing the &s;entence of Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel, <Q>He that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted,</Q> he mo&s;t bla&s;phe|mou&s;ly again&s;t God's holy word &s;aid, <Q>Sure it was not true; for if I, &s;aid he, had not put forth, nor advanced my&s;elf, but follow|ed this rule, I had never come to this dig|nity;</Q> for which bla&s;phemy, the vengeance of God &s;mote him with &s;udden death.</P>
<P>I fear me a great number are in England, which though in words they deny not this &s;entence of Chri&s;t's, yet inwardly they can &s;carce dige&s;t it; el&s;e certainly they would never &s;eek &s;o ambitiou&s;ly to advance them|&s;elves, to climb by their own might, un|called; never &s;eeking the public weal, but rather the de&s;truction thereof, for their pri|vate wealth and lucre; which cau&s;eth us to have &s;o many evil magi&s;trates. For all the while that men gather goods unju&s;tly, by polling, pilling, u&s;ury, extortion, and &s;imony, and therewith &s;eek to climb with bribes and buying of offices, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch to be whole&s;ome magi&s;trates. They enter
<PB N="283" REF="282">in at the window (which is u&s;ed as well in civil government as in eccle&s;ia&s;tical) and therefore may Chri&s;t's words well be verified, <Q>He that entereth not in at the door into the &s;heepfold, but climbeth up &s;ome other way, the &s;ame is a thief and a robber.</Q> And I&s;aiah's complaint again&s;t Jeru&s;alem taketh place among us, <Q>Thy princes are wicked, and companions of thieves; they love gifts altogether, and gape for rewards: as for the fatherle&s;s, they help not him in his right, neither will they let the widow's cau&s;e come before them.</Q> They will not know their office to be ordained of God, for the wealth and defence of all innocents, for the aid of all that be in mi&s;ery. The time is come that Solomon &s;peaketh of, <Q>When the wicked man bears rule, the people &s;hall mourn.</Q> When had ever the people &s;uch cau&s;e to mourn as now, when the great|e&s;t number of all magi&s;trates are occupied in their own bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;eeking rather the mi|&s;ery of the people, than to take it away; rather to oppre&s;s them, than to defend them. Their hands be ready to receive their money, to rob and &s;poil them; but their ears are
<PB N="284" REF="283">&s;hut from hearing their complaints, they are blind to behold their calamities.</P>
<P>Look in all countries how lady Avarice hath &s;et on work altogether mighty men, gentlemen, and rich men, to rob and &s;poil the poor; to turn them from their livings and from their right; for ever the weake&s;t go to the wall. And being thus tormented, and put from their right at home, they come to London in great numbers, as to a place where ju&s;tice &s;hould be had, and there they can have none. They are &s;uitors to great men, and cannot come to their &s;peech; their &s;ervants mu&s;t have bribes, and that no &s;mall ones; 'all love bribes.' But &s;uch as be &s;o dainty to hear the poor, let them take heed le&s;t God make it as &s;trange to them when they &s;hall call: for as Solomon &s;aith, <Q>Who|&s;o &s;toppeth his ear at the crying of the poor, he &s;hall cry and not be heard.</Q> We find that poor men might come to complain of their wrongs to the king's own per&s;on. King Joram, although he was one of the &s;ons of Ahab (no good king) yet heard the poor wi|dow's cau&s;e, and cau&s;ed her to have right: &s;uch was the u&s;e then.&mdash;I would to God that
<PB N="285" REF="284">all noblemen would diligently note that chap|ter, and follow the example: it would not then be &s;o hard for the poor to have acce&s;s to them; nor coming to their pre&s;ence, they &s;hould not be made &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed and even &s;peechle&s;s with terrible looks, but &s;hould mercifully and lovingly be heard, and &s;uc|coured gladly for Chri&s;t's love, con&s;idering we are the members of his body; even as my hand would be glad to help my foot when it is annoyed.&mdash;O with what glad hearts and clear con&s;ciences might noblemen go to re&s;t, when they had be&s;towed the whole day in hearing Chri&s;t him&s;elf complain in his mem|bers, and redre&s;&s;ing his wrongs! But alas, for lack hereof, poor people are driven to &s;eek their right among the lawyers; and there, as the prophet Joel &s;aith, look what the caterpillars had left in their robbery and oppre&s;&s;ion at home, all that doth the greedy locu&s;ts, the lawyers, devour at London: they laugh with the money which maketh others to weep: and thus are the poor robbed on every &s;ide without redre&s;s, and that of &s;uch as &s;eem to have authority thereto.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="285">When Chri&s;t &s;uffered his pa&s;&s;ion, there was one Barabbas, St. Matthew called him a notable thief, a gentleman thief, &s;uch as rob now-a-days in velvet coats; the other two were ob&s;cure thieves, and nothing famous. The ru&s;tical thieves were hanged, and Ba|rabbas was delivered. Even &s;o now-a-days, the little thieves are hanged that &s;teal of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, but the great Barabba&s;es have free li|berty to rob and to &s;poil without all mea&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of the city.

<P>Truly for lack that this bu&s;ine&s;s is not ap|plied, but the poor de&s;pi&s;ed in all places, it hath given &s;uch boldne&s;s to covetous cormo|rants abroad, that now their robberies, extortion, and open oppre&s;&s;ion, hath no end nor limits, no banks can keep in their vio|lence.

There be &s;o many mighty Nimrods in England, mighty hunters, that hunt for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and lord&s;hips, that poor men are daily hunted out of their livings; there is no covert or den can keep them &s;afe. The&s;e Nimrods have &s;uch quick &s;melling hounds, they can lie at London and turn men out of their farms and tenements an

And now our valiant Nim|rods can compa&s;s the matter without the help of Jezebels; yet hath England even now a great number of Jezebels, which to maintain their intolerable pride, their golden heads, will not &s;tick to put to their wicked hands.&mdash;O Lord, what a number of &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ors, wor&s;e than Ahab, are in England, which '&s;ell the poor for a pair of &s;hoes!' of whom if God &s;hould &s;erve but three or four, as he did Ahab, and make the dogs lap the blood of them, I think it would cau&s;e a great number to beware of extortion, to be|ware of oppre&s;&s;ion: and yet, e&s;caping tem|poral puni&s;hments, they are certain by God's word, their blood is re&s;erved for hell-hounds, which they nothing fear. A pitiful ca&s;e, and great blindne&s;s, that, hearing God's word,

<P>Yet hath England had of late &s;ome ter|rible examples of God's wrath in &s;udden and &s;trange deaths of &s;uch as join field to field, and hou&s;e to hou&s;e: great pity they were not chronicled to the terror of others, which fear neither God nor man; &s;o hardened in &s;in, that they &s;eek not to hide it, but rather are &s;uch as glory in their mi&s;chief. Which maketh me oftentimes to remember a writer in our time, Mu&s;culus, upon St. Matthew's go&s;pel, which marvelled much at the &s;ubtle and manifold working of Satan; how he after the expelling of &s;uper&s;tition and hypo|cri&s;y, travelleth mo&s;t bu&s;ily to bring in open impiety: that whereas before, men feared men, though not God; now a great number fear neither God nor man: the mo&s;t wicked are counted mo&s;t manlike, and innocency holden bea&s;tline&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet may we not &s;ay, hypocri&s;y is expelled: for as many of the&s;e Ahabs as &s;ignify they favour God's word by reading or hearing it, or with prayer, <Q>honouring him, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, with their lips, their hearts being
<PB N="292" REF="291">far from him,</Q> are as dete&s;table hypocrites as ever were covered in cowl or cloy&s;ter. I cannot liken them better than to the Jews, that &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <Q>Hail, king of the Jews.</Q> What their painted friend&s;hip is, and how of Chri&s;t it is e&s;teemed, St. Au&s;tin &s;etteth forth by an apt &s;imilitude: <Q>Even as, &s;aith he, a man &s;hould come up to embrace thee, to ki&s;s and honour thee upward, and beneath, with a pair of &s;hoes beaten full of nails, tread upon thy bare foot; the head &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e the honour done unto it, and for the foot that &s;marteth, &s;ay, Why tread|e&s;t thou upon me? So when feigned go&s;|pelers honour Chri&s;t our head &s;itting in heaven, and oppre&s;s his members on earth, the head &s;hall &s;peak for the feet that &s;mart, and &s;ay, Why treade&s;t thou on me?</Q> Paul had a zeal towards God, hut he did tread upon Chri&s;t's feet on earth, for whom the head crieth forth of heaven, 'Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?' Although Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right hand of his father, yet lieth he in earth, he &s;uffereth all calamities here on earth, he is many times evil intreat|ed here on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="292">Would to God we could bear away this brief and &s;hort le&s;&s;on, that what we do to his members upon earth, we do to him; it would bring men from oppre&s;&s;ion to &s;hew mercy, without which no man can obtain mercy. If they would remember how the rich glutton was damned in hell, not as we read for any violence, but for not &s;hewing mercy, they might &s;oon gather how &s;harp judgment remaineth for them, which are not only unmerciful, but al&s;o violently add there|unto oppre&s;&s;ion; who are &s;o far from mercy, that their hearts will &s;erve them to de&s;troy whole towns; they would wi&s;h all the peo|ple de&s;troyed, to have all the fields brought to a &s;heep-pa&s;ture. O cruel mercy! It is like to the mercy of a bi&s;hop of Magunce in Germany, named Hatto, which, as the chro|nicles mention, five hundred years ago, in time of a great dearth, called all the poor people in all the whole country into a great barn, pretending to make a great dole; but having them &s;ure, he fired the barn, and burnt them all up, &s;aying, <Q>The&s;e be the mice which devour up the corn.</Q> This was a policy to make bread more cheap, but for this unmer|ciful
<PB N="294" REF="293">mercy, God made him an example for all unmerciful men to the world's end; for a multitude of rats came and devoured him in &s;uch terrible &s;ort, that where his name was written in windows, walls, or hangings, they never cea&s;ed till it were razed out.&mdash;Some peradventure &s;hrink to hear &s;uch cruelty: but doubtle&s;s there is almo&s;t daily as great cruelty practi&s;ed among us by &s;uch blood-&s;uckers, as being infected with the great drop&s;y of avarice, alway drinking and ever a-thir&s;t, by fami&s;h|ing poor people, drinking up their blood, and with long continuance therein, torment them more grievou&s;ly than he that burnt them all in one hour.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing, as I &s;aid, this cruelty, rob|bery, and extortion, groweth daily to &s;uch intolerable exce&s;s, and overfloweth this realm, becau&s;e it is not puni&s;hed nor re&s;trained; it is high time for all tho&s;e magi&s;trates that fear God, not only to ab&s;tain from this evil them|&s;elves, but to re&s;i&s;t it al&s;o. It is God's bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he hath commanded it, and will &s;traitly require it. Would to God all noblemen would beware by the example of Saul. He was commanded to apply God's bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="295" REF="294"><Q>Go and &s;mite Amalek, and have no com|pa&s;&s;ion on them,</Q> &amp;c. he left his bu&s;ine&s;s undone, &s;pared Amalek, and the faire&s;t of the bea&s;ts: but for this negligence he re|ceived of Samuel a &s;orrowful me&s;&s;age from God; <Q>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t ca&s;t away the word of the Lord, he hath ca&s;t thee off al&s;o from being king.</Q> Even &s;o in every chri&s;|tian commonwealth, God hath commanded rulers to de&s;troy Amalek, all extortion, op|pre&s;&s;ion, and robbery, to defend the needy and all innocents.

<P>But let it once be known, that not only our mo&s;t noble king, who&s;e godly example is a lantern to all other, but that al&s;o all his nobles about him have wholly bent them|&s;elves in his bu&s;ine&s;s, to with&s;tand all vio|lence, and to oppo&s;e all oppre&s;&s;ion, for de|fence of God's people; that the wicked A|habs might know, that God had in Eng|land a great number of pa&s;tors, patrons, feeders and cheri&s;hers of his people: it
<PB N="296" REF="295">&s;hould do that which the fear of God can|not do; that is, &s;top the great rage of vio|lence, oppre&s;&s;ion, and extortion: which ta|ken away, would pluck from many their va|nity in &s;uperfluous and mon&s;trous apparel, &s;umptuous building, &s;uch as &s;eek to bring Paradi&s;e into earth, being the greate&s;t cau&s;es of all oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;poiling of poor people; which mo&s;t unchri&s;tian vanities, and blind affections, never reigned &s;o much in all e&s;tates in England as at this day. It was a notable &s;aying of Charles V. emperor of that name, to the duke of Venice, when he had &s;een his princely palace; when the duke looked that he &s;hould have prai&s;ed it exceed|ingly, Charles gave it none other commenda|tion but this, <Q>Haec &s;unt quae faciunt invitos mori: The&s;e earthly vanities, &s;aid he, are what make us loth to die.</Q> A truer &s;en|tence could not well be &s;poken by any man. I could wi&s;h we would look on all our build|ings, when the beauty thereof &s;o increa&s;eth, that it would grieve us to depart from it, and to remember with all the holy patriarchs, and with St. Paul &s;ay, that <Q>we have not here

<P>But truly methinks now in England, for our vain delight in curious buildings, God hath plagued us, as he did the builders of Babel, not with the confu&s;ion of tongues, but with the confu&s;ion of wits. Our fancies can never be plea&s;ed: pluck down and &s;et up, and when it contenteth us not, down with it again. Our minds are never contented, nor ever &s;hall be, while we &s;eek felicity where it is not. Would God every one would con|&s;ider what a hell it &s;hould be to all that vain|ly delight herein, when death &s;hall with great violence pluck them from their earthly hea|ven. Moreover, extortion taken away &s;hall &s;oon abate the unmea&s;urable exce&s;s in co&s;tly fare.

<P><PB N="298" REF="297">And here in conclu&s;ion, I de&s;ire all noble|men and godly magi&s;trates, deeply to ponder and revolve in their memory what acceptable &s;ervice they may do, chiefly to God, and &s;e|condly to the king's maje&s;ty, and his whole realm, in employing their whole &s;tudy how to re&s;i&s;t all &s;uch as &s;poil Chri&s;t's people, whom he &s;o tenderly loved that he &s;hed his blood for them.

For God's word plainly telleth us, both that evil and dumb pa&s;tors, and wicked
<PB N="299" REF="298">rulers and magi&s;trates, are &s;ent of God, as a plague and puni&s;hment for the &s;ins of the people; and therefore, both I&s;aiah and Ho&s;ea, after the mo&s;t terrible threatenings of God's vengeance for &s;in, bring it in as a mo&s;t griev|ous plague of all, that even the prie&s;ts, which &s;hould call them from &s;in, &s;hall become as evil as the people. Which plague St. Ber|nard &s;aid in his time was come with a ven|geance, for becau&s;e the prie&s;ts were much wor&s;e than the people. And Amos, as a mo&s;t grievous puni&s;hment of all other, threatneth hunger, not of bread, but of hearing God's word. And concerning the civil magi&s;trates, it is plain in Job, that for the &s;ins of the people God rai&s;eth hypocrites to reign over them; that is to &s;ay, &s;uch as have the bare names of governors and pro|tectors, and are indeed de&s;troyers, oppre&s;&s;ors of the people, &s;ubverters of the law and of all equity.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing it is &s;o, &s;o many as feel the grief and &s;mart of this plague, ought not to murmur again&s;t other; but patiently &s;uffer, and be offended with their own &s;ins, which have de&s;erved this &s;courge, and much more;
<PB N="300" REF="299">and &s;tudy for amendment, that God may take it away. For if they continue as they do, to murmur again&s;t God and their rulers, as the I&s;raelites did, to provoke daily his an|ger by multiplying &s;in in his &s;ight, with en|vy, malice, deceit, backbiting, &s;wearing, for|nication, and with utter contempt of his word; he &s;hall for their puni&s;hment &s;o mul|tiply the number of evil governors, unju&s;t judges, ju&s;tices, and officers, that as it was &s;poken by a je&s;ter in the emperor Claudius's time, the images of good magi&s;trates may all be graven in one ring.</P>
<P>God hath cau&s;e greatly to be di&s;plea&s;ed with all e&s;tates. When every man &s;hould look upon his own faults to &s;eek amendment, as it is a proverb lately &s;prung up, 'No man amendeth him&s;elf, but every man &s;eeketh to amend other,' and all the while nothing is amended. Gentlemen &s;ay, the commonalty live too well at ea&s;e, they grow every day to be gentlemen, and know not them&s;elves; their horns mu&s;t be cut &s;horter, by rai&s;ing their rents, by fines, and by plucking away their pa&s;tures.&mdash;The mean men, they mur|mur and grudge, and &s;ay, the gentlemen
<PB N="301" REF="300">have all, and there were never &s;o many gen|tlemen and &s;o little gentlene&s;s: and by their natural logic you &s;hall hear them rea&s;on, how improperly the&s;e two conjugata, the&s;e yoak-fellows, gentlemen and gentlene&s;s, are ba|ni&s;hed &s;o far a&s;under; and they lay all the mi&s;ery of this commonwealth upon the gen|tlemens &s;houlders.&mdash;But alas, good chri&s;tians, this is not the way of amendment: <Q>If ye bite and devour one another, as St. Paul &s;aith, take ye heed le&s;t ye be con&s;umed one of another.</Q></P>
<P>Hi&s;tories make mention of a people called Anthropophagi, eaters of men, which all mens hearts abhor to hear of; and yet, alas, by St. Paul's rule, England is full of &s;uch man-eaters. Every man envieth another, every man biteth and gnaweth upon another with venomous adders tongues, far more noi|&s;ome than any teeth. And whereof cometh it? Covetou&s;ne&s;s is the root of all; every man &s;cratcheth and pilleth from other; every man would &s;uck the blood of other; every man encroacheth upon another. Covetou&s;|ne&s;s hath cut away the large wings of charity, and plucketh all to her&s;elf; &s;he is never &s;a|tisfied;
<PB N="302" REF="301">&s;he hath che&s;ted all the old gold in England, and much of the new; &s;he hath made that there was never more idolatry in England than at this day: but the idols are hid, they come not abroad.&mdash;Alas, noble prince, the images of your ance&s;tors graven in gold, and yours al&s;o, contrary to your mind, are wor&s;hipped as Gods; while the poor lively images of Chri&s;t peri&s;h in the &s;treets through hunger and cold. This com|eth when covetou&s;ne&s;s hath bani&s;hed from among&s;t us chri&s;tian charity; when, like mo&s;t unthankful children, we have forgotten Chri&s;t's la&s;t will, which he &s;o often before his pa&s;&s;ion did inculcate, 'Love one another.'</P>
<P>And herein we &s;hew our&s;elves wor&s;e than any carnal &s;ons; be they never &s;o unkind, yet alway they remember the la&s;t words of their earthly parents. Nay rather I may &s;ay, we are much wor&s;e than the brute bea&s;ts; of whom, when we con&s;ider how wonder|fully nature hath framed them to concord and unity, to pre&s;erve and help one another of their own kind, it may make us utterly to be a&s;hamed. The harts &s;wimming, with much pain bear up their heads in the water;
<PB N="303" REF="302">for the remedy whereof, every one layeth his head upon the hinder part of another: when the formo&s;t, having no &s;tay, is &s;ore weary, he cometh behind, and thus every one in his cour&s;e taketh pain for the whole herd.&mdash;If men, endued with rea&s;on, would learn of the&s;e unrea&s;onable creatures this le&s;&s;on, to help one another, as we are commanded by St. Paul, &s;aying, <Q>Bear ye one another's bur|then, and &s;o you &s;hall fulfil the law, of Chri&s;t,</Q> how &s;oon then &s;hould charity, the bond of perfection, which &s;eeketh not her own, but rather to profit others, be &s;o &s;pread among all degrees, that our commonwealth &s;hould flouri&s;h in all godline&s;s? But alas! we &s;ee that all goeth contrary. For while all men, as St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>&s;eek the things that be their own, and not other mens, not things which appertain to Chri&s;t,</Q> &s;elf-love, and love of private commodity, hath bani&s;h|ed charity and love to the commonwealth.</P>
<P>And if we &s;hould &s;eek the cau&s;e and ground of all the&s;e evils, why God's bu&s;i|ne&s;s is &s;o neglected among all e&s;tates and de|grees, I think it would appear to be igno|rance of his will. For if Mary and Jo&s;eph,
<PB N="304" REF="303">&s;o godly and devout a couple, under&s;tood not for a time Chri&s;t's &s;aying, <Q>Wi&s;t ye not that I mu&s;t go about my father's bu&s;ine&s;s? as St. Luke &s;aith, they under&s;tood not that &s;aying,</Q> what marvel is it, if we, living &s;o carnally, and drowned in worldly plea&s;ures, and framed to the &s;hape of this world, be ig|norant in our heavenly father's bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore cannot well apply it? But &s;hall we think this to be very &s;trange? Many ap|ply not God's bu&s;ine&s;s nor his will, which yet would di&s;dain to be counted ignorant therein. But undoubtedly, good chri&s;tians, it is an infallible verity, that negligence in performing God's will cometh of ignorance. It is all one to know God and his will; and St. John &s;aith plainly, <Q>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</Q> For if he do know God, he cannot but love him; and love is always occupied in God's bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>By this rule St. Augu&s;tine proveth, we can|not keep the fir&s;t precept perfectly, to love God, &s;o well as we ought to do while we are in this mortal life; for all our love cometh of know|ledge, but in this life our knowledge is im|perfect. And thus St. Augu&s;tine's rule,
<PB N="305" REF="304">grounded upon St. John, is true, <Q>That &s;o far as we do know God, &s;o far we love him; and &s;o they that love him nothing at all, they know him nothing at all, al|though they &s;eem to have never &s;o much windy knowledge, puffing up their &s;to|machs with pre&s;umption,</Q> as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, 'Knowledge maketh a man &s;well:' &s;o that if a man hath &s;tudied the &s;cripture all his life long, and learned the whole bible by heart, and yet have no love, he is ignorant of God's will. The poor man that never opened book, if the Love of God be &s;hed abroad in his Heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, over|cometh him in the knowledge of God's will. The godly Pembus, of whom we read in ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, when he was fir&s;t taught the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the thirty-ninth p&s;alm, <Q>I have &s;aid, I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not in my tongue,</Q> refu&s;ed a long time to take out a new le&s;&s;on, judging his fir&s;t le&s;&s;on to be unlearned, till he could perfectly practi&s;e it by an holy conver&s;ation. So ought we always to make our account to have learn|ed God's word, only when we have learned charity and obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="305">But this knowledge, though it lack in many learned, yet ordinarily it cometh by hearing God's word, <Q>Faith cometh of hear|ing, and hearing of the word of God.</Q> Wherefore, as I &s;aid, their ca&s;e is to be la|mented, which would gladly hear God's word, and can have no preachers. Then may we &s;ay, God hath abundantly poured his grace among us, that have his go&s;pel &s;o clearly &s;et forth unto us, and have &s;uch op|portunity, that there wanteth nothing but ears to hear: we mu&s;t have ears to let it &s;ink into our hearts. But, O men, thrice unhappy, and children of greater damnation, if we harden our hearts, and receive &s;uch abundance of grace in vain. <Q>The earth, &s;aith St. Paul, which after the rain bring|eth forth thorns and briars, is reproved, and is nigh unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned.</Q></P>
<P>Would God all that be in the court, that will not vouch&s;afe (having &s;o many godly &s;ermons) to come forth out of the hall into the chapel to hear them, would remember what a heavy &s;troke of God's vengeance hangeth over all their heads that contemn
<PB N="307" REF="306">his word; and over tho&s;e in all places, which had rather be idle, and many times ungodly occupied in wanton and wicked pa&s;times, than come to the church; profaning the &s;abbath day, appointed for the &s;ervice of God, and the hearing of his word, be&s;tow|ing it more wickedly than many of the Gen|tiles. Yet if they would come to the &s;er|mons, though their hearts were not well di&s;|po&s;ed, God's word might win them, as St. Augu&s;tine was won by the preaching of St. Ambro&s;e, when he came only to hear his &s;weet voice and eloquence. O that they knew what di&s;honour they did to Chri&s;t, that e&s;teem him &s;o light, to prefer vain, nay, I &s;ay wicked things, to the hearing of his holy word. Are not the&s;e they, as St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>which tread under foot the Son of God, count the blood of his te&s;tament, wherein they are &s;anctified, an unholy thing; and do de&s;pite to the Spirit of grace?</Q> O Lord, how can&s;t thou hold thy hands from puni&s;hing this unthankfulne&s;s? Certainly I think all other wickedne&s;s com|pared to this, is &s;hadowed, and &s;eemeth to be le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="307">I would to God we would remember many times the plagues and tokens of God's extreme wrath that came upon the Jews, when fir&s;t unthankfully they rejected Chri&s;t, and after his word; when they were de|&s;troyed by Titus and Ve&s;pa&s;ian, &s;uch a plague as never came upon any other country. And look on their vices; there reigned avarice, ambition, pride, extortion, envy, adultery; but the&s;e reigned al&s;o in other countries about, where no &s;uch vengeance did light: but then did God thus exerci&s;e his wrath upon them to the terror of all other, for con|tempt of his holy word, and for their un|thankfulne&s;s; which being called &s;o many ways, by his prophets, by him&s;elf, by the apo&s;tles, &s;till hardened their hearts: this ex|ceeded all other wickedne&s;s in the world. Now if as great unthankfulne&s;s be found in many of us towards Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, &s;et forth &s;o plainly unto us, how can we, without &s;peedy repentance, but look for the terrible &s;troke of vengeance. <Q>God, &s;aith Valerius Maximus, hath feet of wool; he cometh &s;lowly to puni&s;h, but he hath hands of iron; when he cometh, he &s;triketh &s;ore.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="308">Philip, king of Macedonia, hearing of one in his kingdom which refu&s;ed mo&s;t unthank|fully to receive a &s;tranger, (of whom before he had been &s;uccoured in &s;hipwreck) in ex|treme need; for a worthy puni&s;hment, cau&s;ed to be printed in his forehead with an hot iron the&s;e two words, <Q>Ingratus ho&s;pes, An unthankful gue&s;t.</Q> O Lord, if we con&s;i|der when we were &s;trangers from God, in the &s;hipwreck of &s;in, how mercifully Chri&s;t hath delivered us, and born our &s;ins upon his body; if after all this, we mo&s;t unthankfully refu&s;e to receive him, by refu&s;ing his word, may we not think our&s;elves worthy many hot irons to print our unthankfulne&s;s to our &s;hame? And undoubtedly, &s;o many as con|tinue thus unthankful, though it be not writ|ten in their foreheads to put them to worldly &s;hame, yet &s;hall it be graven in their con|&s;cience, to their everla&s;ting confu&s;ion and damnation, when <Q>the books of every man's con&s;cience &s;hall be laid open,</Q> as Daniel &s;aith. Their judgment &s;hall be more &s;trait than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.&mdash;Let us all then, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, pray with one accord, that God may &s;often and
<PB N="310" REF="309">prepare our hearts with meekne&s;s, and hu|mility, and thankfulne&s;s, to embrace his go&s;|pel, and his holy word; which &s;hall in&s;truct us in his holy will, and teach us to know his bu&s;ine&s;s, every man in his vocation, <Q>that, as St. Paul &s;aith, every man may give attendance to them&s;elves, and to the flock, wherein the holy Gho&s;t hath made them over&s;eers, to feed the congregation of God which he hath purcha&s;ed with his blood,</Q> that all ravenous wolves may be turned to good &s;hepherds. So that Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters may enjoy the portion a&s;&s;igned for the go&s;|pel; that all magi&s;trates and governors may give their whole &s;tudy to the public weal, and not to their private wealth; that they may be maintainers of ju&s;tice, and puni&s;hers of wrong; and that all inferiors may live in due obedience, meekly contenting them&s;elves every one in their vocation, without mur|muring or grudging; that under Chri&s;t, and our noble prince, his mini&s;ter here on earth, we all being knit together with chri&s;tian cha|rity, the bond of perfection, may &s;o fa&s;ten our eyes upon God's word, that it may con|tinually be a lantern to our feet, to guide our
<PB N="311" REF="310">journey through the de&s;art and dark wilder|ne&s;s of this world, that our eyes be never &s;o blinded with &s;hadows of worldly things, as to make us embrace life, deceitful and tem|poral felicity, for that which is true, &s;tedfa&s;t, and everla&s;ting; that this candle which &s;hin|eth now, as St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>as through a gla&s;s darkly,</Q> when that which is imper|fect &s;hall be taken away, may pre&s;ent us to that clear light, which never is &s;hadowed with any darkne&s;s; that we may behold that ble&s;&s;ed &s;ight of the glorious Trinity, the Fa|ther, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, to whom be all prai&s;e, all honour, and glory world without end.</P>
