<P><HI>The following Piece is taken from an underplot in The Fir&s;t Part of King Edward the Fourth, written by Thomas Heywood; the dialogue has been altered a little, to render it fit for modern repre&s;entation; and a few pa&s;&s;ages have been added for connexion and conclu&s;ion.</HI></P>

<P>The Dramatic Piece of <HI>"The King in the Country,"</HI> was compiled and performed la&s;t &s;ummer, imme|diately on <HI>His Maje&s;ty's</HI> return from Cheltenham; when Entertainments of various kinds were exhi|bited at the different Places of Public Amu&s;ement, having relation to the Royal Excur&s;ion. The Ca|lamity which, to the grief of every good mind, has &s;ince befallen <HI>Our Beloved Sovereign,</HI> does not, it is pre|&s;umed, render the publication of this Drama im|proper; had the Editor thought it &s;o, it would cer|tainly have been withheld: for, having been honoured with <HI>The Royal Authority</HI> to &s;uperintend Theatrical Entertainments the&s;e ten years pa&s;t (during which period it has been nece&s;&s;ary for him to adapt pieces of a local, or temporary nature, to Provincial Theatres), no one can entertain a more proper &s;en&s;e of duty, re&s;pect, loyalty, and affection, to <HI>Our mo&s;t gracious King,</HI> whom God pre&s;erve and re&s;tore!</P>

<L>Let me alone,&mdash;I'm a dead man!&mdash;</L>
<L>Ah, my liege! that ye &s;hould deal &s;o with a poor &s;imple</L>
<L>Tanner! but its no matter, I can but die.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when, Tanner? can'&s;t thou tell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, e'en when ye plea&s;e; for I have &s;o defended ye, by calling ye plain Ned, mad rogue, and ra&s;cal, that I know ye'll have me hang'd. Therefore, no more ado, but let my &s;on and I e'en be tru&s;s'd up together.&mdash;And here's another, as hone&s;t as your&s;elf no doubt; ye made me call him plain Tom, and I warrant his name is Thomas, and &s;ome man of wor&s;hip too; therefore, let's to our doom, e'en when and where ye will.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tanner, attend! not only do we pardon thee</L>
<L>Thy plain and blunt, tho' hone&s;t, well-meant &s;peech,</L>
<L>But in all princely kindne&s;s welcome thee!</L>
<L>And thy &s;on's tre&s;pa&s;s do we pardon too;</L>
<STAGE>Young Hobbs <HI>kneels.</HI></STAGE>
<L>With this ob&s;ervance, that he &s;in no more</L>
<L>In &s;uch-like &s;ort, el&s;e &s;hall he &s;urely die!</L>
<L>For he who from his prince's clemency</L>
<L>Hath once received a ju&s;tly-forfeit life,</L>
<L>And brings it into jeopardy again,</L>
<L>De&s;erves not mercy, nor e'en pity merits.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Hobbs.</SPEAKER>
<L>If I offend again, my gracious liege!</L>
<L>Let me not mercy, nor e'en pity find.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well! Receive with kindne&s;s thy repentant &s;on;</L>
<L>And in return for what thou freely gav'&s;t</L>
<L>To aid our enterpri&s;e 'gain&s;t haughty France,</L>
<L>We give to thee and thine in yearly fee</L>
<L>An hundred marks; now, Tanner, what do&s;t &s;ay?</L>

<P>Why, an'like your king&s;hip, I can &s;carce &s;ay at all! but, I thank ye!&mdash;I thank ye for my &s;on's life, I thank ye for not putting me to death; and when I get back to Tamworth, my Nell &s;hall work a &s;carf, and &s;end ye; and I'll not forget a &s;kin of choice cordovan, of my own tanning, to make ye boots again&s;t ye next go a hunting: when, if ye would but once more leave your king&s;hip behind ye, come to my poor hovel, and be plain hail-fellow Ned again, we'd have &s;uch a row&s;e, as &s;hould make all the hair on my hides &s;tand an end! and &s;o, farewell!</P>
<L>Heaven ble&s;s ye! &s;till I'll &s;ay or &s;ing,</L>
<L>Long live your Maje&s;ty! God &s;ave the King!</L>

<L>The Drama ended, EDWARD is no more!</L>
<L>But for his lo&s;s we little need deplore;</L>
<L>GEORGE, great and good! yet lives, and may he long!</L>
<L>Join, then, all loyal hearts in cheerful &s;ong;</L>
<L>Lift high your voices 'till the roof doth ring,</L>
<L>In duteous homage to great GEORGE our KING!</L>
