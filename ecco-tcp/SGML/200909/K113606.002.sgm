<HEAD>CHAP. I. A Compari&s;on of Animals with the inferior Ranks of
Creation.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given an account of the earth in general, and the advantages
and inconveniencies with which it abounds, we now come to con|&s;ider it more
minutely. Having de&s;cribed the habitation, we are naturally led to enquire
after the inhabitants. Amid&s;t the infinitely different productions which the
earth offers, and with which it is every where covered, ani|mals hold the
fir&s;t rank; as well becau&s;e of the finer formation of their parts as of
their &s;upe|rior power. The vegetable, which is fixed to <PB N="2" REF="4">
one &s;pot, and obliged to wait for its accidental &s;upplies of nouri&s;hment,
may be con&s;idered as the pri&s;oner of nature. Unable to correct the
di&s;advantages of its &s;ituation, or to &s;hield it&s;elf from the dangers
that &s;urround it, every object that has motion may be its de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>But, animals are endowed with powers, of motion and defence. The
greate&s;t part are capable, by changing place, of commanding Nature; and of
thus obliging her to furni&s;h that nouri&s;hment which is mo&s;t agreeable to
their &s;tate. Tho&s;e few that are fixed to one &s;pot, even in this
&s;eemingly helple&s;s &s;ituation, are, neverthele&s;s, protected from
external injury, by an hard &s;helly covering; which they often can clo&s;e at
plea&s;ure, and thus defend them|&s;elves from every a&s;&s;ault. And here, I
think, we may draw the line between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Every
animal, by &s;ome means or other, finds protection from injury; either from its
force, or courage, its &s;wiftne&s;s, or cunning. Some are protected by hiding
in convenient places; and others by taking refuge in an hard re&s;i&s;ting
&s;hell. But, vegetables are totally unprotected; they are expo&s;ed to every
a&s;&s;ailant, and patiently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in every at|tack. In a word, an
animal is an organized being that is in &s;ome mea&s;ure provided for its own 
<PB N="3" REF="5"> &s;ecurity; a vegetable is de&s;titute of every
pro|tection.</P>
<P>But though it is very ea&s;y, without the help of definitions, to
di&s;tingui&s;h a plant from an animal, yet both po&s;&s;e&s;s many properties
&s;o much alike, that the two kingdoms, as they are called, &s;eem mixed with
each other. Hence, it frequently puzzles the naturali&s;t to tell ex|actly
where animal life begins, and vegetative terminates; nor, indeed, is it ea&s;y
to re&s;olve, whether &s;ome objects offered to view be of the lowe&s;t of the
animal, or the highe&s;t of the vege|table races. The &s;en&s;itive plant, that
moves at the touch, &s;eems to have as much perception as the fre&s;h water
polypus, that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;till flower &s;hare of motion.
Be&s;ides, the &s;en|&s;itive plant will not re-produce upon cutting in pieces,
which the polypus is known to do; &s;o that the vegetable production &s;eems to
have the &s;uperiority. But, notwith&s;tanding this, the polypus hunts for its
food, as mo&s;t other animals do. It changes its &s;ituation; and, therefore
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of chu&s;ing its food, or retreating from danger.
Still, there|fore, the animal kingdom is far removed above the vegetable; and
its lowe&s;t denizen is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of very great privileges, when
com|pared with the plants with which it is often &s;urrounded.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">However, both cla&s;&s;es have many
re&s;em|blances, by which they are rai&s;ed above the un|organized and inert
ma&s;&s;es of nature. Mi|nerals are mere inactive, in&s;en&s;ible bodies,
en|tirely motionle&s;s of them&s;elves, and waiting &s;ome external force to
alter their forms, or their properties. But, it is otherwi&s;e with animals and
vegetables; the&s;e are endued with life and vigour; they have their &s;tate of
im|provement and decay; they are capable of re|producing their kinds; they grow
from &s;eeds, in &s;ome, and from cuttings in others; they &s;eem all
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ation, in a greater or le&s;s degree; they both
have their enmities and affections; and as &s;ome animals are, by nature,
impelled to violence, &s;o &s;ome plants are found to exterminate all others,
and make a wilder|ne&s;s of the places round them. As the lion makes a de&s;ert
of the fore&s;t where it re&s;ides, thus no other plant will grow under the
&s;hade of the machinel-tree. Thus, al&s;o, that plant, in the We&s;t-Indies,
called caraguata, clings round whatever tree it happens to approach: there it
quickly gains the a&s;cendant; and, load|ing the &s;ame with a verdure not its
own, keeps away that nouri&s;hment de&s;igned to feed the trunk; and, at
la&s;t, entirely de&s;troys its &s;up|porter.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">As all animals are ultimately &s;upported upon
vegetables, &s;o vegetables are greatly pro|pagated, by being made a part of
animal food. Birds di&s;tribute the &s;eeds wherever they fly, and quadrupeds
prune them into greater luxuriance. By the&s;e means the quantity of food, in a
&s;tate of nature, is kept equal to the number of the con&s;umers; and, le&s;t
&s;ome of the weaker ranks of animals &s;hould find nothing for their
&s;upport, but all the provi&s;ions be devoured by the &s;trong, different
vegetables are appropriated to different appetites. If tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this
rule, the &s;tronger ranks &s;hould invade the rights of the weak, and,
breaking through all regard to appetite, &s;hould make an indi&s;criminate
u&s;e of every vegetable, nature then puni&s;hes the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and
poi&s;on marks the crime as capital.</P>
<P>If again we compare vegetables and animals, with re&s;pect to the
places where they are found, we &s;hall find them bearing a &s;till &s;tronger
&s;imili|tude. The vegetables that grow in a dry and &s;unny &s;oil, are
&s;trong and vigorous, though not luxuriant; &s;o, al&s;o, are the animals of
&s;uch a climate. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, that are the joint product of heat
and moi&s;ture, are luxuriant and tender: and the animals a&s;&s;imi|lating to
the vegetable food, on which they ulti|mately <PB N="6" REF="8"> &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
are much larger in &s;uch places than in others. Thus, in the internal parts of
South-America, and Africa, where the &s;un u&s;ually &s;corches all above,
while inundations cover all below, the in&s;ects, reptiles, and other animals,
grow to a prodigious &s;ize: the earth|worm of America is often a yard in
length, and as thick as a walking cane; the boiguacu, which is the large&s;t of
the &s;erpent kind, is &s;ometimes forty feet in length; the bats, in tho&s;e
countries, are as big as a rabbit; the toads are bigger than a duck, and their
&s;piders are as large as a &s;parrow. On the contrary, in the cold frozen
regions of the north, where ve|getable nature is &s;tinted of its growth, the
few animals in tho&s;e climates partake of the dimi|nution; all the wild
animals, except the bear, are much &s;maller than in milder countries; and
&s;uch of the dome&s;tic kinds as are carried thither, quickly degenerate, and
grow le&s;s. Their very in&s;ects are of the minute kinds, their bees and
&s;piders being not half &s;o large as tho&s;e in the temperate zone.</P>
<P>The &s;imilitude between vegetables and ani|mals is no where more
obvious than in tho&s;e that belong to the ocean, where the nature of one is
admirably adapted to the nece&s;&s;ities of the other. This element it is well
known has its vegetables, <PB N="7" REF="9"> and its in&s;ects that feed upon
them in great abundance. Over many tracts of the &s;ea, a weed is &s;een
floating, which covers the &s;urface, and gives the re&s;emblance of a green
and exten&s;ive meadow. On the under &s;ide of the&s;e un&s;table plants,
millions of little animals are found, adapted to their &s;ituation. For as
their ground, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, lies over their heads, their feet are
placed upon their backs; and as land animals have their legs below their
bodies, the&s;e have them above. At land al&s;o, mo&s;t animals are furni&s;hed
with eyes to &s;ee their food; but at &s;ea, almo&s;t all the reptile kinds are
without eyes, which might only give them pro&s;pects of danger, at a time when
unprovided with the means of e&s;caping it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Amaenitates, vol. v. p. 68.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus, in all places, we perceive an obvious &s;imilitude between the
animals and the vege|tables of every region. In general, however, the mo&s;t
perfect races have the lea&s;t &s;imilitude to the vegetable productions on
which they are ultimately fed; while, on the contrary, the meaner the animal,
the more local it is found to be, and the more it is influenced by the
va|rieties of the &s;oil where it re&s;ides. Many of the more humble reptile
kinds are not only confined to one country, but al&s;o to a plant; nay, even to
<PB N="8" REF="10"> a leaf. Upon that they &s;ub&s;i&s;t; encrea&s;e with its
vegetation, and &s;eem to decay as it declines. They are merely the
circum&s;cribed inhabitants of a &s;ingle vegetable; take them from that and
they in&s;tantly die; being entirely a&s;&s;imilated to the plant they feed on,
a&s;&s;uming its colour, and even its medicinal properties. For this rea&s;on
there are infinite numbers of the meaner animals that we have never an
opportunity of &s;eeing in this part of the world; they are inca|pable of
living &s;eparate from their kindred ve|getables, which grow only in a certain
climate.</P>
<P>Such animals as are formed more perfect, lead a life of le&s;s
dependance; and, &s;ome kinds are found to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in many parts of the
world at the &s;ame time. But, of all the races of animated nature, man is the
lea&s;t af|fected by the &s;oil where he re&s;ides, and lea&s;t influenced by
the variations of vegetable &s;u&s;tenance: equally unaffected by the
luxuriance of the warm climates, or the &s;terility of the poles, he has
&s;pread his habitations over the whole earth; and finds &s;ub&s;i&s;tence as
well amid&s;t the ice of the north as the burning de|&s;arts under the line.
All creatures of an in|ferior nature, as has been &s;aid, have peculiar
propen&s;ities to peculiar climates; they are cir|cum&s;cribed to zones, and
confined to territo|ries <PB N="9" REF="11"> where their proper food is found
in greate&s;t abundance; but, man may be called the ani|mal of every climate,
and &s;uffers but very gra|dual alterations from the nature of any
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>As to animals of a meaner rank, whom man compels to attend him in
his migrations, the&s;e being obliged to live in a &s;tate of con&s;traint, and
upon vegetable food, often different from that of their native &s;oil, they
very &s;oon alter their natures with the nature of their nouri&s;hment,
a&s;|&s;imilate to the vegetables upon which they are fed, and thus a&s;&s;ume
very different habits as well as appearances. Thus, man, unaffected him&s;elf,
alters and directs the nature of other animals at his plea&s;ure; encrea&s;es
their &s;trength for his delight, or their patience for his
ne|ce&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>And this power of altering the appearances of things &s;eems to have
been given him for very wi&s;e purpo&s;es. The Deity, when he made the earth,
was willing to give his favoured creature many opponents, that might at once
exerci&s;e his virtues, and call forth his latent abilities. Hence we find, in
tho&s;e wide uncultivated wilderne&s;&s;es, where man, in his &s;avage &s;tate,
owns inferior &s;trength, and the bea&s;ts claim divided dominion, that the
whole fore&s;t &s;warms with noxious animals and vegetables; animals, 
<PB N="10" REF="12"> as yet unde&s;cribed, and vegetables which want a name. In
tho&s;e rece&s;&s;es Nature &s;eems rather lavi&s;h than magnificent, in
be&s;towing life. The trees are u&s;ually of the large&s;t kinds, covered round
with para&s;ite plants, and inter|woven at the tops with each other. The
boughs, both above and below, are peopled with various generations; &s;ome of
which have never been upon the ground, and others that have never &s;tirred
from the branches on which they were produced. In this manner millions of
minute, and loath&s;ome creatures, pur&s;ue a round of uninterrupted
exi&s;tence, and enjoy a life &s;carce &s;uperior to vegetation. At the &s;ame
time, the vegetables, in tho&s;e places, are of the larger kinds, while the
animal race is of the &s;maller: but, man has altered this di&s;|po&s;ition of
nature; having, in a great mea&s;ure, levelled the exten&s;ive fore&s;ts,
cultivated the &s;ofter and finer vegetables, de&s;troyed the num|berle&s;s
tribes of minute and noxious animals, and taken every method to encrea&s;e a
numerous breed of the larger kinds. He thus has ex|erci&s;ed a &s;evere
control; unpeopled nature, to embelli&s;h it; and dimini&s;hed the &s;ize of
vege|table, in order to improve that of the animal kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">To &s;ubdue the earth to his own u&s;e, was, and
ought to be, the aim of man; which was only to be done by encrea&s;ing the
number of plants, and dimini&s;hing that of animals: to multiply exi&s;tence,
alone was that of the Deity. For this rea&s;on, we find, in a &s;tate of
nature, that animal life is encrea&s;ed to the greate&s;t quantity
po&s;&s;ible: and, we can &s;carce form a &s;y&s;tem that could add to its
numbers. Fir&s;t, plants, or trees, are provided, by Nature, of the large&s;t
kinds; and, con&s;equently, the nou|ri&s;hing &s;urface is thus extended. In
the &s;econd place, there are animals peculiar to every part of the vegetable,
&s;o that no part of it is lo&s;t. But, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible encrea&s;e
of life would &s;till be deficient, were there not other animals that lived
upon animals them&s;elves; and the&s;e are, them&s;elves, in turn, food for
&s;ome other greater and &s;tronger &s;et of crea|tures. Were all animals to
live upon vegetables alone, thou&s;ands would be extinct that now have
exi&s;tence, as the quantity of their pro|vi&s;ion would &s;hortly fail. But,
as things are wi&s;ely con&s;tituted, one animal now &s;upports another; and
thus, all take up le&s;s room than they would by living on the &s;ame food; as,
to make u&s;e of a familiar in&s;tance, a greater number of people may be
crowded into the <PB N="12" REF="14"> &s;ame &s;pace, if each is made to bear
his fellow upon his &s;houlders.</P>
<P>To dimini&s;h the number of animals, and en|crea&s;e that of
vegetables, has been the general &s;cope of human indu&s;try; and, if we
compare the utility of the kinds, with re&s;pect to man, we &s;hall find, that
of the va&s;t variety in the animal kingdom, but very few are &s;erviceable to
him; and, in the vegetable, but very few are entirely noxious. How &s;mall a
part of the in&s;ect tribes, for in&s;tance, are beneficial to man|kind, and
what numbers are injurious! In &s;ome countries they almo&s;t darken the air: a
candle cannot be lighted without their in&s;tantly flying upon it, and putting
out the flame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa's De&s;cription of
Guayaquil.</BIBL></NOTE>. The clo&s;e&s;t rece&s;&s;es are no &s;afeguard from
their an|noyance; and the mo&s;t beautiful land&s;capes of nature only &s;erve
to invite their rapacity. As the&s;e are injurious, from their multitudes; &s;o
mo&s;t of the larger kinds are equally dreadful to him, from their courage and
ferocity. In the mo&s;t uncultivated parts of the fore&s;t the&s;e maintain an
undi&s;puted empire; and man in|vades their retreats with terror. The&s;e are
terrible; and there are &s;till more that are ut|terly u&s;ele&s;s to him, that
&s;erve to take up that room which more beneficial creatures 
<PB N="13" REF="15"> might po&s;&s;e&s;s; and incommode him, rather with their
numbers than their enmities. Thus, in a catalogue of land animals, that amounts
to more than twenty thou&s;and, we can &s;carcely reckon up an hundred that are
any way u&s;eful to him; the re&s;t, being either all his open, or his &s;ecret
enemies, immediately attacking him in per&s;on, or intruding upon that food he
has appro|priated to him&s;elf. Vegetables, on the contrary, though exi&s;ting
in greater variety, are but few of them noxious. The mo&s;t deadly poi&s;ons
are often of great u&s;e in medicine; and even tho&s;e plants that only &s;eem
to cumber the ground, &s;erve for food to that race of animals which he has
taken into friend&s;hip, or protection. The &s;maller tribes of vegetables, in
particular, are cultivated, as contributing either to his nece&s;|&s;ities, or
amu&s;ement; &s;o that vegetable life is as much promoted, by human indu&s;try,
as animal life is controlled and dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Hence, it was not without a long &s;truggle, and various
combinations, of experience and art, that man acquired his pre&s;ent dominion.
Almo&s;t every good that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es was the re&s;ult of the
conte&s;t; for, every day, as he was con|tending, he was growing more wi&s;e;
and, pa|tience and fortitude were the fruits of his in|du&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">From hence, al&s;o, we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity
of &s;ome animals living upon each other, to fill up the plan of Providence;
and we may, con&s;e|quently, infer the expediency of man's living upon all.
Both animals and vegetables &s;eem equally fitted to his appetites; and, were
any religious, or moral motives, to re&s;train him from taking away life, upon
any account, he would only thus give exi&s;tence to a variety of beings made to
prey upon each other; and, in&s;tead of preventing, he would only thus multiply
mu|tual de&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we &s;urvey animals in their &s;tate of maturity, and
performing the functions adapted to their re&s;pective natures, method requires
that we &s;hould con&s;ider them in the more early periods of their
exi&s;tence. There was a time when the proude&s;t and the noble&s;t animal was
a partaker of the &s;ame imbecility with the meane&s;t reptile; and, while yet
a candidate for exi&s;tence, was equally helple&s;s and contemp|tible. In their
incipient &s;tate all are upon a footing; the in&s;ect and the philo&s;opher
being equally in&s;en&s;ible, clogged with matter, and uncon&s;cious of
exi&s;tence. Where then are we to begin with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e beings,
that make &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the crea|tion? Or, where lie
tho&s;e peculiar characters in the parts that go to make up animated nature;
that mark one animal as de&s;tined to creep in the du&s;t, and another to
glitter on the throne?</P>
<P>This has been a &s;ubject that has employed the curio&s;ity of all
ages, and the philo&s;ophers of every age have attempted the &s;olution. In
tracing up Nature to her mo&s;t hidden rece&s;&s;es, <PB N="16" REF="18"> &s;he
becomes too minute, or ob&s;cure, for our in&s;pection; &s;o that we find it
impo&s;&s;ible to mark her fir&s;t differences, to di&s;cover the point where
animal life begins, or the cau&s;e that conduces to &s;et it in motion. We know
little more than that the greate&s;t number of animals require the concurrence
of a male and female to reproduce their kind; and that the&s;e, di&s;tinctly
and invariably, are found to beget creatures of their own &s;pecies.
Curio&s;ity has, therefore, been active, in trying to di&s;cover the imme|diate
re&s;ult of this union, how far either &s;ex contributes to the be&s;towing
animal life, and whether it be to the male or female that we are mo&s;t
indebted for the privilege of our ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has &s;uppo&s;ed that fecundity pro|ceeded from the
mixture of the &s;eminal liquor of both &s;exes, each of which equally
contri|bute to the formation of the incipient animal. Ari&s;totle, on the other
hand, would have the &s;eminal liquor in the male alone to contribute to this
purpo&s;e, while the female &s;upplied the proper nouri&s;hment for its
&s;upport. Such were the opinions of the&s;e fathers of philo&s;ophy; and
the&s;e continued to be adopted by the na|turali&s;ts, and &s;chool-men, of
&s;ucceeding ages, with blind veneration. At length, Steno and 
<PB N="17" REF="19"> Harvey, taking anatomy for their guide, gave mankind a
nearer view of nature, ju&s;t advanc|ing into animation. The&s;e perceived in
all &s;uch animals as produced their young alive, two glandular bodies, near
the womb, re|&s;embling that ovary, or clu&s;ter of &s;mall eggs, which is
found in fowls; and, from the analogy between both, they gave the&s;e al&s;o
the name of ovaria. The&s;e, as they re&s;embled eggs, they naturally concluded
had the &s;ame offices; and, therefore, they were induced to think that all
animals, of what kind &s;oever, were produced from eggs. At fir&s;t, however,
there was &s;ome altercations rai&s;ed again&s;t this &s;y&s;tem; for, as
the&s;e ovaria were &s;eparate from the womb, it was objected that they could
not be any way in&s;trumental in repleni&s;hing that organ, with which they did
not communicate. But, upon more minute in&s;pection, Fallopius, the
anato|mi&s;t, perceived two tubular ve&s;&s;els depending from the womb, which,
like the horns of a &s;nail, had a power of erecting them&s;elves, of embracing
the ovaria, and of receiving the eggs, in order to be fecundated by the
&s;eminal liquor. This di&s;covery &s;eemed, for a long time after, to fix the
opinions of philo&s;ophers. The doctrine of Hippocrates was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed,
and the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of generation was a&s;cribed <PB N="18" REF="20"> to
the female. This was, for a long time, the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion of the
&s;chools; but Lowen|hoeck, once more, &s;hook the whole &s;y&s;tem, and
produced a new &s;chi&s;m among the lovers of &s;peculation. Upon examining the
&s;eminal li|quor of a great variety of male animals, with micro&s;copes, which
helped his &s;ight more than that of any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, he perceived
therein infinite numbers of little living crea|tures, like tadpoles, very
bri&s;k, and floating in the fluid, with a &s;eeming voluntary motion. Each of
the&s;e, therefore, was thought to be the rudiments of an animal, &s;imilar to
that from which it was produced; and this only re|quired a reception from the
female, together with proper nouri&s;hment, to complete its growth. The
bu&s;ine&s;s of generation was now, therefore, given back to the male a
&s;econd time, by many; while others &s;u&s;pended their a&s;&s;ent, and
cho&s;e rather to confe&s;s ignorance than to embrace error<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet's Con&s;iderations &s;ur Corps

<P>In this manner has the di&s;pute continued for &s;everal ages,
&s;ome accidental di&s;covery &s;erving, at intervals, to renew the debate, and
revive cu|rio&s;ity. It was a &s;ubject where &s;peculation could find much
room to di&s;play it&s;elf; and, Mr. Buffon, who loved to &s;peculate, would
not <PB N="19" REF="21"> omit &s;uch an opportunity of giving &s;cope to his
propen&s;ity. According to this mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all naturali&s;ts, the
micro&s;cope di&s;covers that the &s;eminal liquor, not only of males, but of
females al&s;o, abounds in the&s;e moving little animals, which have been
mentioned above, and that they appear equally bri&s;k in either fluid. The&s;e
he takes not to be real animals, but organical particles, which, being
&s;imple, cannot be &s;aid to be organized them&s;elves, but which go to the
compo&s;ition of all organized bodies what|&s;oever. In the &s;ame manner as a
tooth, in the wheel of a watch, cannot be called either the wheel, or the
watch, and yet contributes to the &s;um of the machine. The&s;e organical
particles are, according to him, diffu&s;ed throughout all nature, and to be
found not only in the &s;eminal liquor, but in mo&s;t other fluids in the parts
of vegetables, and all parts of animated nature. As they happen, therefore, to
be differently applied, they &s;erve to con&s;titute a part of the animal, or
the vegetable, who&s;e growth they &s;erve to encrea&s;e, while the
&s;uperfluity is thrown off in the &s;eminal liquor of both &s;exes, for the
re-production of other animals or vegetables of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The&s;e
particles a&s;&s;ume different figures, according to the receptacle into which
they enter; falling into the womb <PB N="20" REF="22"> they unite into a
foetus; beneath the bark of a tree they pullulate into branches; and, in
&s;hort, the &s;ame particles that fir&s;t formed the animal in the womb,
contribute to encrea&s;e its growth when brought forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this &s;y&s;tem it has been objected, that it is impo&s;&s;ible
to conceive organical &s;ub|&s;tances without being organized; and that, if
dive&s;ted of organization them&s;elves, they could never make an organized
body, as an infinity of circles could never make a triangle. It has been
objected, that it is more difficult to con|ceive the transformation of the&s;e
organical par|ticles than even that of the animal, who&s;e growth we are
enquiring after; and this &s;y&s;tem, therefore, attempts to explain one
ob&s;cure thing by another &s;till more ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>But an objection, &s;till &s;tronger than the&s;e, has been
advanced, by an ingenious country|man of our own; who a&s;&s;erts, that the&s;e
little animals, which thus appear &s;wimming, and &s;porting, in almo&s;t every
fluid we examine with a micro&s;cope, are not real living particles, but &s;ome
of the more opake parts of the fluid, that are thus encrea&s;ed in &s;ize, and
&s;eem to have a much greater motion than they have in reality. For the motion
being magnified with the object, <PB N="21" REF="23"> the &s;malle&s;t degree
of it will &s;eem very con&s;ider|able; and a being almo&s;t at re&s;t may, by
the&s;e means, be apparently put into violent action. Thus, for in&s;tance, if
we look upon the &s;ails of a windmill moving, at a di&s;tance, they appear to
go very &s;low; but, if we approach them, and thus magnify their bulk to our
eye, they go round with great rapidity. A micro&s;cope, in the &s;ame manner,
&s;erves to bring our eye clo&s;e to the object, and thus to enlarge it; and
not only encrea&s;e the magnitude of its parts, but of its motion. Hence,
therefore, it would follow, that the&s;e organical par|ticles that are &s;aid
to con&s;titute the bulk of living nature, are but mere optical illu&s;ions;
and the &s;y&s;tem founded on them mu&s;t, like them, be illu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other objections, have been made to this
&s;y&s;tem; which, in&s;tead of enlight|ening the mind, &s;erve only to &s;hew,
that too clo&s;e a pur&s;uit of Nature chiefly leads to un|certainty. Happily,
however, for mankind, the mo&s;t intricate enquiries are generally the mo&s;t
u&s;ele&s;s. In&s;tead, therefore, of balancing accounts between the &s;exes,
and attempting to a&s;certain to which the bu&s;ine&s;s of generation mo&s;t
properly belongs, it will be more in|&s;tructive, as well as amu&s;ing, to
begin with <PB N="22" REF="24"> animal nature, from its earlie&s;t retirements,
and evane&s;cent outlines, and pur&s;ue the incipient creature through all its
changes in the womb till it arrives into open day.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual di&s;tinction of animals, with re|&s;pect to their
manner of generation, has been into the oviparous and viviparous kinds; or, in
other words, into tho&s;e that bring forth an egg, which is afterwards hatched
into life, and tho&s;e that bring forth their young alive and perfect. In one
of the&s;e two ways all ani|mals were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been produced, and
all other kinds of generation were &s;uppo&s;ed imaginary or erroneous. But
later di&s;coveries have taught us to be more cautious in making general
conclu&s;ions, and have even induced many to doubt whether animal life may not
be produced merely from putrefaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet.
Con&s;id. p. 100.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Indeed, the infinite number of creatures that putrid &s;ub&s;tances
&s;eem to give birth to, and the variety of little in&s;ects &s;een floating in
liquors, by the micro&s;cope, appear to favour this opi|nion. But, however this
may be, the former method of cla&s;&s;ing animals can now by no means be
admitted, as we find many animals that are produced neither from the womb, nor
from the &s;hell, but merely from cuttings; &s;o <PB N="23" REF="25"> that to
multiply life in &s;ome creatures, it is &s;ufficient only to multiply the
di&s;&s;ection. This being the &s;imple&s;t method of generation, and that in
which life &s;eems to require the &s;malle&s;t preparation for its exi&s;tence,
I will begin with it, and &s;o proceed to the two other kinds, from the
meane&s;t to the mo&s;t elaborate.</P>
<P>The earth-worm, the millipedes, the &s;ea-worm, and many marine
in&s;ects, may be multiplied by being cut in pieces; but the polypus is noted
for its amazing fertility; and from hence it will be proper to take the
de&s;cription. The &s;tructure of the polypus may be compared to the finger of
a glove, open at one end, and clo&s;ed at the other. The clo&s;ed end
repre&s;ents the tail of the polypus, with which it &s;erves to fix it&s;elf to
any &s;ub&s;tance it happens to be upon; the open end may be compared to the
mouth; and, if we conceive &s;ix or eight &s;mall &s;trings i&s;&s;uing from
this end, we &s;hall have a proper idea of its arms, which it can erect,
lengthen, and contract, at plea&s;ure, like the horns of a &s;nail. This
creature is very voracious, and makes u&s;e of its arms as a fi&s;herman does
of his net, to catch, and entangle &s;uch little animals as happen to come
within its reach. It lengthens the&s;e arms &s;everal inches, keeps them
&s;eparated from each other, and thus oc|cupies <PB N="24" REF="26"> a large
&s;pace in the water, in which it re&s;ides. The&s;e arms, when extended, are
as fine as threads of &s;ilk, and have a mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite degree of feeling.
If a &s;mall worm happens to get within the &s;phere of their activity, it is
quickly entangled by one of the&s;e arms, and, &s;oon after, the other arms
come to its aid: the&s;e altogether &s;hortening, the worm is drawn into the
animal's mouth, and quickly devoured, colouring the body as it is &s;wallowed.
Thus much is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved of this ani|mal's method of living,
to &s;hew that it is not of the vegetable tribe, but a real animal, perform|ing
the functions which other animals are found to perform, and endued with powers
that many of them are de&s;ti&s;tute of. But what is mo&s;t extraordinary
remains yet to be told; for, if examined with a micro&s;cope, there are &s;een
&s;e|veral little &s;pecks, like buds, that &s;eem to pul|lulate from different
parts of its body; and the&s;e, &s;oon after appear to be young polypi
them&s;elves, and like the large polypus, begin to ca&s;t their little arms
about for prey, in the &s;ame manner. Whatever they happen to en&s;nare is
de|voured, and gives a colour not only to their own bodies, but to that of the
parent; &s;o that the &s;ame food is dige&s;ted, and &s;erves for the
nou|ri&s;hment of both. The food of the little one <PB N="25" REF="27">
pa&s;&s;es into the large polypus, and colours its body; and this, in its turn,
dige&s;ts, and &s;wal|lows its food to pa&s;s into theirs. In this man|ner
every polypus has a new colony &s;prouting from its body; and the&s;e new ones,
even while attached to the parent animal, become parents them&s;elves, having a
&s;maller colony al&s;o bud|ding from them. All, at the &s;ame time, bu&s;ily
employed in &s;eeking for their prey, and the food of any one of them &s;erving
for the nou|ri&s;hment, and circulating through the bodies of all the re&s;t.
This &s;ociety, however, is every hour di&s;&s;olving; tho&s;e newly produced
are &s;een at intervals to leave the body of the large poly|pus, and become,
&s;hortly after, the head of a beginning colony them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this manner the polypus multiplies natu|rally; but, one may take
a much readier and &s;horter way to encrea&s;e them, and this only by cutting
them in pieces. Though cut into thou|&s;ands of parts, each part &s;till
retains its viva|cious quality, each &s;hortly becomes a di&s;tinct and a
complete polypus; whether cut lengthways, or cro&s;sways, it is all the &s;ame;
this extraordinary creature &s;eems a gainer by our endeavours, and multiplies
by apparent de&s;truction. The ex|periment has been tried, times without
number, and &s;till attended with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. Here, 
<PB N="26" REF="28"> therefore, naturali&s;ts who have been blamed for the
cruelty of their experiments upon living animals, may now boa&s;t of their
encrea&s;ing animal life, in&s;tead of de&s;troying it. The pro|duction of the
polypus is a kind of philo&s;o|phical generation. The famous Sir Thomas Brown
hoped one day to be able to produce children by the &s;ame method as trees are
pro|duced; the polypus is multiplied in this man|ner; and every philo&s;opher
may thus, if he plea&s;es, boa&s;t of a very numerous, though, I &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e, a very u&s;ele&s;s progeny.</P>
<P>This method of generation, from cuttings, may be con&s;idered as the
mo&s;t &s;imple kind, and is a &s;trong in&s;tance of the little pains Nature
takes in the formation of her lower, and humbler productions. As the removal of
the&s;e from inanimate into animal exi&s;tence is but &s;mall, there are but
few preparations made for their journey. No organs of generation &s;eem
provided, no womb to receive, no &s;hell to protect them in in their &s;tate of
tran&s;ition. The little reptile is quickly fitted for all the offices of its
humble &s;phere, and, in a very &s;hort time, arrives at the height of its
contemptible perfection.</P>
<P>The next generation is of tho&s;e animals that we &s;ee produced
from the egg. In this man|ner all birds, mo&s;t fi&s;hes, and many of the
in|&s;ect <PB N="27" REF="29"> tribes, are brought forth. An egg may be
con&s;idered as a womb, detached from the body of the parent animal, in which
the embryo is but ju&s;t beginning to be formed. It may be regarded as a kind
of incomplete delivery, in which the animal is di&s;burthened of its young
before its perfect formation. Fi&s;hes, and in|&s;ects, indeed, mo&s;t
u&s;ually commit the care of their eggs to hazard; but birds, which are more
perfectly formed, are found to hatch them into maturity, by the warmth of their
bodies. How|ever, any other heat, of the &s;ame temperature, would an&s;wer the
end as well; for either the warmth of the &s;un, or of a &s;tove, is equally
efficacious in bringing the animal in the egg to perfection. In this re&s;pect,
therefore, we may con&s;ider generation from the egg as inferior to that in
which the animal is brought forth alive. Nature has taken care of the
viviparous ani|mal in every &s;tage of its exi&s;tence. That force which
&s;eparates it from the parent, &s;eparates it from life; and the embryo is
&s;hielded with un|cea&s;ing protection till it arrives at exclu&s;ion. But it
is different with the little animal in the egg; often totally neglected by the
parent, and always &s;eparable from it, every accident may retard its growth,
or even de&s;troy its exi&s;t|ence. Be&s;ides, art, or accident, al&s;o, may
bring <PB N="28" REF="30"> this animal to a &s;tate of perfection; &s;o that it
can never be con&s;idered as a complete work of Nature, in which &s;o much is
left for accident to fini&s;h, or de&s;troy.</P>
<P>But, however inferior this kind of generation may be, the
ob&s;ervation of it will afford great in|&s;ight into that of nobler animals,
as we can here watch the progre&s;s of the growing embryo, in every period of
its exi&s;tence, and catch it in tho&s;e very moments when it fir&s;t &s;eems
&s;tealing into motion. Malpighi and Haller have been particularly
indu&s;trious on this &s;ubject; and, with a patience almo&s;t equalling that
of the &s;it|ting hen, have attended incubation in all its &s;tages. From them,
therefore, we have an amazing hi&s;tory of the chicken in the egg, and of its
advances into complete formation.</P>
<P>It would be methodically tedious to de&s;cribe tho&s;e parts of the
egg, which are well known, and obvious; &s;uch as its &s;hell, its white, and
its yolk; but the di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e is not &s;o apparent. Immediately
under the &s;hell lies that common membrane, or &s;kin, which lines it on the
in&s;ide, adhereing clo&s;ely to it every where, except at the broad end, where
a little cavity is left, that is filled with air, which encrea&s;es as the
animal within grows larger. Under this mem|brane are contained two whites,
though &s;eeming to us to be only one, each wrapped up in a <PB N="29" REF="31"> membrane of its own, one white within the other. In the mid&s;t of
all is the yolk, wrapt round, likewi&s;e, in its own membrane. At each end of
this are two ligaments, called chalazae, which are, as it were, the poles of
this microco&s;m, being white den&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, made from the membranes,
and &s;erving to keep the white and the yolk in their places. It was the
opinion of Mr. Derham that they &s;erved al&s;o for ano|ther purpo&s;e: for a
line being drawn from one ligament to the other, would not pa&s;s directly
through the middle of the yolk, but rather to|wards one &s;ide, and would
divide the yolk into two unequal parts, by which means the&s;e liga|ments
&s;erved to keep the &s;malle&s;t &s;ide of the yolk always uppermo&s;t; and in
this part he &s;uppo&s;ed the cicatricula, or fir&s;t &s;peck of life, to
re&s;ide; which, by being upermo&s;t, and con|&s;equently next the hen, would
be thus in the warme&s;t &s;ituation. But this is rather fan|ciful than true,
the incipient animal being found in all &s;ituations, and not particularly
in|fluenced by any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
cicatricula, which is the part where the animal fir&s;t begins to &s;hew
&s;igns of life, is not unlike a vetch, or a lentil, lying on one &s;ide of the
yolk, and within its mem|brane. All the&s;e contribute to the little ani|mal's
convenience, or &s;upport; the outer mem|branes, <PB N="30" REF="32"> and
ligaments, pre&s;erve the fluids in their proper places; the white &s;erves as
nouri&s;h|ment; and the yolk, with its membranes, after a time, becomes a part
of the animal's body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
is the de&s;cription of an hen's egg, and an&s;wers to that of all others, how
large or how &s;mall &s;oever.</P>
<P>Previous to putting the eggs to the hen, our philo&s;ophers fir&s;t
examined the cicatricula, or little &s;pot, already mentioned; and which may be
con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important part of the egg. This was found, in
tho&s;e that were im|pregnated by the cock, to be large; but, in tho&s;e laid
without the cock, very &s;mall. It was found, by the micro&s;cope, to be a kind
of bag, containing a tran&s;parent liquor, in the mid&s;t of which the embryo
was &s;een to re&s;ide. The embryo re&s;embled a compo&s;ition of little
threads, which the warmth of future incubation tended to enlarge, by varying,
and liquifying the other fluids contained within the &s;hell, and thus
pre&s;&s;ing them either into the pores or tubes of their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Upon placing the eggs in a proper warmth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Malpighi.</BIBL></NOTE>, either under the &s;un, or in a
&s;tove, after &s;ix hours the vital &s;peck begins to dilate, like the pupil
of the eye. The head of the chicken is <PB N="31" REF="33"> di&s;tinctly
&s;een, with the back-bone, &s;omething re|&s;embling a tadpole, floating in
its ambient fluid, but as yet &s;eeming to a&s;&s;ume none of the func|tions of
animal life. In about &s;ix hours more the little animal is &s;een more
di&s;tinctly; the head becomes more plainly vi&s;ible, and the ver|tebrae of
the back more ea&s;ily perceivable. All the&s;e &s;igns of preparation for life
are encrea&s;ed in &s;ix hours more; and, at the end of twenty-four hours, the
ribs begin to take their places, the neck begins to lengthen, and the head to
turn to one &s;ide.</P>
<P>At this time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Harvey.</BIBL></NOTE>,
al&s;o, the fluids in the egg &s;eem to have changed place; the yolk, which was
before in the center of the &s;hell, approaches nearer to the broad end. The
watery part of the white is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, evaporated through the
&s;hell, and the gro&s;&s;er part &s;inks to the &s;mall end. The little animal
appears to turn towards the part of the broad end, in which a cavity has been
de&s;cribed, and with its yolk &s;eems to adhere to the membrane there. At the
end of forty hours the great work of life &s;eems fairly begun, and the animal
plainly appears to move; the back-bone, which is of a whiti&s;h colour,
thickens; the head is turned &s;till more on one &s;ide; the fir&s;t rudiments
of the <PB N="32" REF="34"> eyes begin to appear; the heart beats, and the
blood begins already to circulate. The parts, however, as yet are fluid; but,
by degrees, become more and more tenacious, and harden into a kind of jelly. At
the end of two days, the liquor, in which the chicken &s;wims, &s;eems to
encrea&s;e; the head appears with two little bladders in the place of eyes, the
heart beats in the manner of every embryo where the blood does not circulate
through the lungs. In about fourteen hours after this, the chicken is grown
more &s;trong; its head, however, is &s;till bent downwards; the veins and the
arteries begin to branch, in order to form the brain; and the &s;pinal marrow
is &s;een &s;tretching along the back bone. In three days, the whole body of
the chicken appears bent; the head, with its two eye-balls, with their
different humours, now di&s;tinctly ap|pear; and five other ve&s;icles are
&s;een, which &s;oon unite to form the rudiments of the brain. The out-lines
al&s;o of the thighs, and wings, begin to be &s;een, and the body begins to
gather fle&s;h. At the end of the fourth day, the ve&s;icles that go to form
the brain, approach each other; the wings and thighs appear more &s;olid; the
whole body is covered with a jelly like fle&s;h; the heart, that was hitherto
expo&s;ed, is now co|vered up within the body, by a very thin 
<PB N="33" REF="35"> tran&s;parent membrane; and, at the &s;ame time, the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els, that unite the animal to the yolk, now appear to come
forth from the ab|domen. After the fifth and &s;ixth days, the ve&s;&s;els of
the brain begin to be covered over; the wings and thighs lengthen; the belly is
clo&s;ed up, and tumid; the liver is &s;een within it, very di&s;tinctly, not
yet grown red, but of a very du&s;ky white; both the ventricles of the heart
are di&s;cerned, as if they were two &s;eparate hearts, beating di&s;tinctly;
the whole body of the animal is covered over; and the traces of the incipient
feathers are already to be &s;een. The &s;eventh day, the head appears very
large; the brain is covered entirely over; the bill begins to appear betwixt
the eyes; and the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect
figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Haller.</BIBL></NOTE>. Hitherto, however,
the animal appears as if it had two bodies; the yolk is joined to it by the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els that come from the belly; and is furni&s;hed with its
ve&s;&s;els, through which the blood circulates, as through the re&s;t of the
body of the chicken, making a bulk greater than that of the animal it&s;elf.
But towards the end of incubation, the umbilical ve&s;&s;els &s;horten the
yolk, and with it the inte&s;|tines are thru&s;t up into the body of the
chicken, <PB N="34" REF="36"> by the action of the mu&s;cles of the belly; and
the two bodies are thus formed into one. During this &s;tate, all the organs
are found to perform their &s;ecretions; the bile is found to be &s;eparated,
as in grown animals; but it is fluid, tran&s;parent, and without bitterne&s;s:
and the chicken then al&s;o appears to have lungs. On the tenth, the mu&s;cles
of the wings appear, and the feathers begin to pu&s;h out. On the eleventh, the
heart, which hitherto had appeared divided, begins to unite; the arteries which
belong to it, join into it, like the fingers into the palm of the hand. All
the&s;e appearances only come more into view, becau&s;e the fluids the
ve&s;&s;els had hitherto &s;ecreted, were more tran&s;parent; but as the
co|lour of the fluids deepen, their operations and circulations are more
di&s;tinctly &s;een. As the animal thus, by the eleventh day completely formed,
begins to gather &s;trength, it becomes more unea&s;y in its &s;ituation, and
exerts its ani|mal powers with encrea&s;ing force. For &s;ome time before it is
able to break the &s;hell in which it is impri&s;oned, it is heard to chirrup,
receiving a &s;ufficient quantity of air for this purpo&s;e, from that cavity
which lies between the membrane and the &s;hell, and which mu&s;t contain air
to re&s;i&s;t the external pre&s;&s;ure. At length, upon the twentieth day, in
&s;ome birds &s;ooner, and later <PB N="35" REF="37"> in others, the enclo&s;ed
animal breaks the &s;hell within which it has been confined, with its beak;
and, by repeated efforts, at la&s;t procures its enlargement.</P>
<P>From this little hi&s;tory we perceive, that tho&s;e parts which are
mo&s;t conducive to life, are the fir&s;t that are begun: the head, and the
back-bone, which no doubt enclo&s;e the brain, and the &s;pinal marrow, though
both are too limpid to be di&s;cerned, are the fir&s;t that are &s;een to
exi&s;t; the beating of the heart is perceived &s;oon after: the le&s;s noble
parts &s;eem to &s;pring from the&s;e; the wings, the thighs, the feet, and,
la&s;tly, the bill. Whatever, therefore, the ani|mal has double, or whatever it
can live without the u&s;e of, the&s;e are late&s;t in production: Na|ture
fir&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly applying to the formation of the nobler organs, without
which life would be of &s;hort continuance, and would be begun in vain.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance between the beginning ani|mal in the egg, and the
embryo in the womb, is very &s;triking; and this &s;imilitude it is that has
induced many to a&s;&s;ert, that all animals are produced from eggs, in the
&s;ame manner. They con&s;ider an egg excluded from the body by &s;ome, and
&s;eparated into the womb by others, to be actions merely of one kind; with
this only <PB N="36" REF="38"> difference, that the nouri&s;hment of the one is
kept within the body of the parent, and en|crea&s;es as the embryo happens to
want the &s;up|ply; the nouri&s;hment of the other is prepared all at once, and
&s;ent out with the beginning ani|mal, as entirely &s;ufficient for its future
&s;upport. But leaving this to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of anatomi&s;ts, let us
proceed rather with facts than di&s;&s;erta|tions; and as we have &s;een the
progre&s;s of an oviparous animal, or one produced from the &s;hell, let us
likewi&s;e trace that of a viviparous animal, which is brought forth alive. In
this inve&s;tigation, Graaf has, with a degree of pa|tience, characteri&s;tic
of his nation, attended the progre&s;s and encrea&s;e of various animals in the
womb, and minutely marked the changes they undergo. Having di&s;&s;ected a
rabbit, half an hour after impregnation, he perceived the horns of the womb,
that go to embrace and commu|nicate with the ovary, to be more red than
be|fore; but no other change in the re&s;t of the parts. Having di&s;&s;ected
another, &s;ix hours after, he perceived the follicules, or the mem|brane
covering the eggs contained in the ova|ry, to become reddi&s;h. In a rabbit
di&s;&s;ected after twenty-four hours, he perceived, in one of the ovaries,
three follicules, and, in the other, five, that were changed; being become,
from tran&s;parent, dark and reddi&s;h. In one <PB N="37" REF="39">
di&s;&s;ected after three days, he perceived the horns of the womb very
&s;trictly to embrace the ovaries; and he ob&s;erved three of the fol|licules
in one of them, much longer and har|der than before: pur&s;uing his
inqui&s;ition, he al&s;o found two of the eggs actually &s;eparated into the
horns of the womb, and each about the &s;ize of a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed;
the&s;e little eggs were each of them enclo&s;ed in a double mem|brane, the
inner parts being filled with a very limpid liquor. After four days, he found,
in one of the ovaries, four, and in the other, five follicules, emptied of
their eggs; and in the horns corre&s;pondent to the&s;e, he found an equal
number of eggs thus &s;eparated: the&s;e eggs were now grown larger than
before, and &s;omewhat of the &s;ize of &s;parrow-&s;hot. In five days, the
eggs were grown to the &s;ize of duck-&s;hot, and could be blown from the part
of the womb where they were, by the breath. In &s;even days, the&s;e eggs were
found of the &s;ize of a pi&s;tol-bullet, each covered with its double
membrane, and the&s;e much more di&s;tinct than before. In nine days, having
examined the liquor contained in one of the&s;e eggs, he found it, from a
limpid colour, le&s;s fluid, to have got a light cloud floating upon it. In ten
days, this cloud began to thicken, and to form an oblong body, of the figure of
a <PB N="38" REF="40"> little worm: and, in twelve days, the figure of the
embryo was di&s;tinctly to be perceived, and even its parts came into view. In
the region of the brea&s;t he perceived two bloody &s;pecks; and two more, that
appeared whiti&s;h. Fourteen days after impregnation, the head of the embryo
was become large and tran&s;parent, the eyes prominent, the mouth open, and the
rudiments of the ears beginning to appear; the back-bone, of a whiti&s;h
colour, was bent towards the brea&s;t; the two bloody &s;pecks being now
con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed, appeared to be nothing le&s;s than the outlines of
the two ventricles of the heart; and the two whiti&s;h &s;pecks on each &s;ide,
now appear|ed to be the rudiments of the lungs; towards the region of the
belly, the liver began to be &s;een, of a reddi&s;h colour; and a little
intricate ma&s;s, like ravelled thread, di&s;cerned, which &s;oon ap|peared to
be the &s;tomach and the inte&s;tines: the legs &s;oon after began to be
&s;een, and to a&s;&s;ume their natural po&s;itions: and from that time forth,
all the parts being formed, every day only &s;erved to develope them &s;till
more, until the thirty-fir&s;t day, when the rabbit brought forth her young,
completely fitted for the purpo&s;es of their humble happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een the &s;tages of generation in the meaner animals,
let us take a view of its <PB N="39" REF="41"> progre&s;s in man; and trace the
feeble begin|nings of our own exi&s;tence. An account of the lowline&s;s of our
own origin, if it cannot amu&s;e, will at lea&s;t &s;erve to humble us; and it
may take from our pride, though it fails to gra|tify our curio&s;ity. We cannot
here trace the variations of the beginning animal, as in the former
in&s;tances; for the opportunities of in|&s;pection are but few and accidental:
for this rea&s;on, we mu&s;t be content often to fill up the blanks of our
hi&s;tory with conjecture. And fir&s;t, we are entirely ignorant of the &s;tate
of the infant in the womb, immediately after con|ception; but we have good
rea&s;on to believe, that it proceeds, as in mo&s;t other animals, from the
egg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This hi&s;tory of the child in the womb is
tran&s;lated from Mr. Buffon, with &s;ome alterations.</NOTE>. Anatomi&s;ts
inform us, that four days after conception, there is found in the womb an oval
&s;ub&s;tance, about the &s;ize of a &s;mall pea, but longer one way than the
other; this little body is formed by an extremely fine membrane, en|clo&s;ing a
liquor a good deal re&s;embling the white of an egg: in this may, even then, be
per|ceived, &s;everal &s;mall fibres, united together, which form the fir&s;t
rudiments of the embryo. Be&s;ide the&s;e, are &s;een another &s;et of fibres,
which &s;oon after become the placenta, or that <PB N="40" REF="42"> body by
which the animal is &s;upplied with nou|ri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Seven days after conception, we can readily di&s;tingui&s;h, by the
eye, the fir&s;t lineaments of the child in the womb. However, they are as yet
without form; &s;hewing, at the end of &s;even days, pretty much &s;uch an
appearance as that of the chicken, after four and twenty hours being a &s;mall
jelly-like ma&s;s, yet exhibiting the rudi|ments of the head; the trunk is
barely vi&s;ible; there likewi&s;e is to be di&s;cerned a &s;mall
a&s;&s;em|blage of fibres i&s;&s;uing from the body of the in|fant, which
afterwards become the blood-ve&s;&s;els that convey nouri&s;hment from the
placenta to the child, while enclo&s;ed in the womb.</P>
<P>Fifteen days after conception, the head be|comes di&s;tinctly
vi&s;ible, and even the mo&s;t pro|minent features of the vi&s;age begin to
appear. The no&s;e is a little elevated; there are two black &s;pecks in the
place of eyes; and two little holes, where the ears are afterwards &s;een. The
body of the embryo al&s;o is grown larger; and both above and below, are &s;een
two little protuberances, which mark the places from whence the arms and thighs
are to proceed. The length of the whole body, at this time, is le&s;s than half
an inch.</P>
<P>At the end of three weeks, the body has re|ceived 
<PB N="41" REF="43"> very little encrea&s;e; but the legs and feet, with the
hands and arms, are become ap|parent. The growth of the arms is more &s;peedy
than that of the legs; and the fingers are &s;ooner &s;eparated than the toes.
About this time, the internal parts are found, upon di&s;&s;ection, to be|come
di&s;tingui&s;hable. The places of the bones are marked by &s;mall thread-like
&s;ub&s;tances, that are yet more fluid even than a jelly. Among them, the ribs
are di&s;tingui&s;hable, like threads al&s;o, di&s;po&s;ed on each &s;ide of
the &s;pine; and even the fingers and toes &s;carce exceed hairs in
thick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In a month, the embryo is an inch long; the body is bent forward, a
&s;ituation which it al|mo&s;t always a&s;&s;umes in the womb, either
be|cau&s;e a po&s;ture of this kind is the mo&s;t ea&s;y, or becau&s;e it takes
up the lea&s;t room. The hu|man figure is now no longer doubtful: every part of
the face is di&s;tingui&s;hable; the body is &s;ketched out; the bowels are to
be di&s;tingui&s;hed as threads; the bones are &s;till quite &s;oft, but in
&s;ome places beginning to a&s;&s;ume a greater rigidity; the blood ve&s;&s;els
that go to the placen|ta, which, as was &s;aid, contributes to the child's
nouri&s;hment, are plainly &s;een i&s;&s;uing from the navel (being therefore
called the umbilical ve&s;&s;els) and going to &s;pread them&s;elves upon 
<PB N="42" REF="44"> the placenta. According to Hippocrates, the male embryo
developes &s;ooner than the female: he adds, that, at the end of thirty days,
the parts of the body of the male are di&s;tingui&s;hable; while tho&s;e of the
female are not equally &s;o till ten days after.</P>
<P>In &s;ix weeks, the embryo is grown two inches long; the human
figure begins to grow every day more perfect; the head being &s;till much
larger, in proportion to the re&s;t of the body; and the motion of the heart is
perceived almo&s;t by the eye. It has been &s;een to beat in an em|bryo of
fifty days old, a long time after it had been taken out of the womb.</P>
<P>In two months, the embryo is more than two inches in length. The
o&s;&s;ification is perceivable in the arms and thighs, and in the point of the
chin, the under jaw being greatly advanced be|fore the upper. The&s;e parts,
however, may as yet be con&s;idered as bony points, rather than as bones. The
umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which before went &s;ide by &s;ide, are now begun to be
twi&s;ted, like a rope, one over the other, and go to join with the placenta,
which as yet is but &s;mall.</P>
<P>In three months, the embryo is above three inches long, and weighs
about three ounces. Hippocrates ob&s;erves, that not till then the mother
perceives the child's motion; and he <PB N="43" REF="45"> adds, that in female
children, the motion is not ob&s;ervable till the end of four months. How|ever,
this is no general rule, as there are women who a&s;&s;ert, that they perceived
them&s;elves to be quick with child, as their expre&s;&s;ion is, at the end of
two months; &s;o that this quickne&s;s &s;eems rather to ari&s;e from the
proportion between the child's &s;trength, and the mother's &s;en&s;ibility,
than from any determinate period of time. At all times, however, the child is
equally alive; and, con&s;equently, tho&s;e juries of matrons that are to
determine upon the pregnancy of cri|minals, &s;hould not enquire whether the
woman be quick, but whether &s;he be with child; if the latter be perceivable,
the former follows of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Four months and an half after conception, the embryo is from &s;ix
to &s;even inches long. All the parts are &s;o augmented, that even their
proportions are now di&s;tingui&s;hable. The very nails begin to appear upon
the fingers and toes; and the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines already begin to
perform their functions of receiving and dige&s;t|ing. In the &s;tomach is
found a liquor &s;imilar to that in which the embryo floats; in one part of the
inte&s;tines, a milky &s;ub&s;tance; and, in the other, an excrementitious.
There is found al&s;o, a &s;mall quantity of bile in the gall-bladder; and 
<PB N="44" REF="46"> &s;ome urine in its own proper receptacle. By this time
al&s;o, the po&s;ture of the embryo &s;eems to be determined. The head is bent
forward, &s;o that the chin &s;eems to re&s;t upon its brea&s;t; the knees are
rai&s;ed up towards the head, and the legs bent backward, &s;omewhat
re&s;embling the po&s;ture of tho&s;e who &s;it on their haunches. Sometimes
the knees are rai&s;ed &s;o high as to touch the cheeks, and the feet are
cro&s;t over each other; the arms are laid upon the brea&s;t, while one of the
hands, and often both, touch the vi&s;age; &s;ometimes the hands are &s;hut,
and &s;ometimes al&s;o, the arms are found hanging down by the body. The&s;e
are the mo&s;t u&s;ual po&s;tures which the embryo a&s;&s;umes; but the&s;e it
is frequently known to change; and it is ow|ing to the&s;e alterations that the
mother &s;o fre|quently feels tho&s;e twitches, which are u&s;ually attended
with pain.</P>
<P>The embryo, thus &s;ituated, is furni&s;hed by Nature with all
things proper for its &s;upport; and, as it encrea&s;es in &s;ize, its
nouri&s;hment al&s;o is found to encrea&s;e with it. As &s;oon as it fir&s;t
begins to grow in the womb, that receptacle, from being very &s;mall, grows
larger; and, what is more &s;urprizing, thicker every day. The &s;ides of a
bladder, as we know, the more they are di&s;tended the more they become thin.
But here, the larger the womb grows the more <PB N="45" REF="47"> it appears to
thicken. Within this the embryo is &s;till farther involved, in two membranes,
called the chorion, and amnios; and floats in a thin tran&s;parent fluid, upon
which it &s;eems, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. However, the great
&s;torehou&s;e, from whence its chief nouri&s;hment is &s;upplied, is called
the placenta; a red &s;ub|&s;tance &s;omewhat re&s;embling a &s;ponge, that
ad|heres to the in&s;ide of the womb, and commu|nicates, by the umbilical
ve&s;&s;els, with the em|bryo. The&s;e umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;i&s;t
of a vein and two arteries, i&s;&s;ue from the navel of the child, and are
branched out upon the placenta; where they, in fact, &s;eem to form its
&s;ub&s;tance; and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, to &s;uck up their
nouri&s;hment from the womb, and the fluids contained therein. The blood thus
received from the womb, by the placenta, and communicated by the umbilical vein
to the body of the embryo, is conveyed to the heart; where, without ever
pa&s;&s;ing into the lungs, as in the born infant, it takes a &s;horter
cour&s;e; for, entering the right auricle of the heart, in|&s;tead of
pa&s;&s;ing up into the pulmonary artery, it &s;eems to break this partition,
and goes di|rectly through the body of the heart, by an opening called the
foramen ovale, and from thence to the aorta, or great artery; by which 
<PB N="46" REF="48"> it is driven into all parts of the body. Thus we &s;ee the
placenta, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply|ing the place of lungs; for as the
little animal can receive no air by in&s;piration, the lungs are therefore
u&s;ele&s;s. But we &s;ee the placenta con|verting the fluid of the womb into
blood, and &s;ending it, by the umbilical vein, to the heart; from whence it is
di&s;patched by a quicker and &s;horter circulation through the whole
frame.</P>
<P>In this manner the embryo repo&s;es in the womb; &s;upplied with
that nouri&s;hment which is fitted to its nece&s;&s;ities, and furni&s;hed with
tho&s;e organs that are adapted to its &s;ituation. As its &s;en&s;ations are
but few, its wants are in the &s;ame proportion; and it is probable that a
&s;leep, with &s;carce any intervals, marks the earlie&s;t period of animal
life. As the little crea|ture, however, gathers &s;trength and &s;ize, it
&s;eems to become more wakeful and unea&s;y; even in the womb it begins to feel
the want of &s;omething that it does not po&s;&s;e&s;s; a &s;en&s;ation that
&s;eems coeval with man's nature, and never leaves him till he dies. The embryo
even then begins to &s;truggle for a &s;tate more marked by plea&s;ure and
pain, and, from about the &s;ixth month, begins to give the mother warning of
the greater pain &s;he is yet to endure. The continuation of pregnancy, in
woman, is u&s;ually <PB N="47" REF="49"> nine months; but there have been many
in|&s;tances when the child has lived that was born at &s;even; and &s;ome
al&s;o, are found to continue pregnant a month above the u&s;ual time. When the
appointed time approaches, the infant, that has for &s;ome months been giving
painful proofs of its exi&s;tence, now begins to encrea&s;e its ef|forts for
liberty. The head is applied down|ward, to the apperture of the womb, and by
reiterated efforts it endeavours to extend the &s;ame: the&s;e endeavours
produce the pain which all women, in labour, feel in &s;ome degree; tho&s;e of
&s;trong con&s;titutions the lea&s;t, tho&s;e mo&s;t weakly the mo&s;t
&s;everely; &s;ince we learn, that the women of Africa always deliver
them|&s;elves, and are well a few hours after; while tho&s;e of Europe require
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and recover more &s;lowly. Thus the infant, &s;till
continuing to pu&s;h with its head forward, by the repetition of its
endeavours, at la&s;t &s;ucceeds, and i&s;&s;ues into life. The blood, which
had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed through the heart, now takes a wider circuit; and the
foramen ovale clo&s;es; the lungs, that had till this time been inactive, now
fir&s;t begin their functions; the air ru&s;hes in to di&s;tend them; and this
produces the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation of pain, which the infant expre&s;&s;es by a
&s;hriek; <PB N="48" REF="50"> &s;o that the beginning of our lives, as well as
the end, is marked with angui&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bonet
Contemplat. de la Nature, vol. i, p. 212.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From comparing the&s;e accounts, we per|ceive that the mo&s;t
laboured generation is the mo&s;t perfect; and that the animal which, in
proportion to its bulk, takes the longe&s;t time for production, is always the
mo&s;t complete when fini&s;hed. Of all others, man &s;eems the &s;lowe&s;t in
coming into life, as he is the &s;lowe&s;t in coming to perfection; other
animals, of the &s;ame bulk, &s;eldom remain in the womb above &s;ix months,
while he continues nine; and even after his birth appears more than any other
to have his &s;tate of imbecility prolonged.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve al&s;o, that that generation is the mo&s;t complete
in which the fewe&s;t animals are produced: Nature, by attending to the
pro|duction of one at a time, &s;eems to exert all her efforts in bringing it
to perfection; but, where this attention is divided, the animals &s;o pro|duced
come into the world with partial ad|vantages. In this manner twins are never,
at lea&s;t while infants, &s;o large, or &s;o &s;trong, as tho&s;e that come
&s;ingly into the world; each having, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, robbed the other of
its right; as that &s;upport, which Nature meant for one, has been prodigally
divided.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">In this manner, as tho&s;e animals are the
be&s;t that are produced &s;ingly, &s;o we find that the noble&s;t animals are
ever the lea&s;t fruitful. The&s;e are &s;een u&s;ually to bring forth but one
at a time, and to place all their attention upon that alone. On the other hand,
all the oviparous kinds produce in amazing plenty; and even the lower tribes of
viviparous animals encrea&s;e in a &s;eeming proportion to their minutene&s;s
and imperfection. Nature &s;eems lavi&s;h of life in the lower orders of the
creation; and, as if &s;he meant them entirely for the u&s;e of the nobler
races, &s;he appears to have be&s;towed greater pains in multiplying the number
than in com|pleting the kind. In this manner, while the elephant, and the
hor&s;e, bring forth but one at a time, the &s;pider and the beetle are &s;een
to produce a thou&s;and: and even among the &s;maller quadrupedes them&s;elves,
all the inferior kinds are extremely fertile; any one of the&s;e being found,
in a very few months, to become the parent of a numerous progeny.</P>
<P>In this manner, therefore, the &s;malle&s;t ani|mals multiply in the
greate&s;t proportion; and we have rea&s;on to thank Providence that the mo&s;t
formidable animals are the lea&s;t fruitful. Had the lion and the tyger the
&s;ame degree of <PB N="50" REF="52"> fecundity with the rabbit, or the rat,
all the arts of man would be unable to oppo&s;e the&s;e fierce invaders; and we
&s;hould &s;oon perceive them become the tyrants of tho&s;e who claim the
lord&s;hip of the creation. But Heaven, in this re&s;pect, has wi&s;ely
con&s;ulted the advantage of all. It has oppo&s;ed to man only &s;uch ene|mies
as he has art and &s;trength to conquer; and as large animals require
proportional &s;up|plies, Nature was unwilling to give new life, where it, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, denied the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed order, the animals that
are endowed with the mo&s;t perfect methods of generation, and bring forth but
one at a time, &s;eldom begin to pro|create till they have almo&s;t acquired
their full growth. On the other hand, tho&s;e which bring forth many, engender
before they have arrived at half their natural &s;ize. The hor&s;e, and the
bull, come almo&s;t to perfection before they begin to generate; the hog, and
the rabbit, &s;carce leave the tate before they become parents them&s;elves. In
whatever light, therefore, we con&s;ider this &s;ubject, we &s;hall find that
all creatures approach mo&s;t to perfection, who&s;e generation mo&s;t nearly
re&s;embles that of man. <PB N="51" REF="53"> The reptile produced from cutting
is but one degree above the vegetable. The animal pro|duced from the egg is
&s;till a &s;tep higher in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence: that cla&s;s of animals
which are brought forth alive, are &s;till more exalted. Of the&s;e, &s;uch as
bring forth one at a time are the mo&s;t complete; and foremo&s;t of the&s;e

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Infancy of Man.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a &s;urvey of the various cla&s;&s;es of animals, and

man to po&s;&s;e&s;s mo&s;t of tho&s;e advantages united, which the re&s;t

to be incapable of obeying its impul&s;e; but Nature has otherwi&s;e provided;
as with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive intellects to com|mand, &s;he has furni&s;hed
him with a body the be&s;t fitted for obedience.</P>
<P>In infancy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iv. p.
173.</BIBL></NOTE>, however, that mind, and this body, form the mo&s;t
helple&s;s union in all ani|mated nature; and, if any thing can give us a
picture of complete imbecillity, it is a man when ju&s;t come into the world.
The infant ju&s;t born &s;tands in need of all things, without the power of
procuring any. The lower races <PB N="53" REF="55"> of animals, upon being
produced, are active, vigorous, and capable of &s;elf-&s;upport; but the infant
is obliged to wait in helple&s;s expectation; and its cries are its only aid to
procure &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>An infant ju&s;t born may be &s;aid to come from one element into
another; for from the watery fluid in which it was &s;urrounded, it now
immerges into air; and its fir&s;t cries &s;eem to imply how greatly it regrets
the change. How much longer it could have continued in a &s;tate of almo&s;t
total in&s;en&s;ibility, in the womb, is impo&s;&s;ible to tell; but it is very
probable that it could remain there &s;ome hours more. In order to throw &s;ome
light upon this &s;ubject, Mr. Buffon &s;o placed a pregnant bitch as that her
puppies were brought forth in warm water, in which he kept them above half an
hour at a time. However, he &s;aw no change in the animals, thus newly brought
forth; they con|tinued the whole time vigorous; and, during the whole time, it
is very probable that the blood circulated through the &s;ame channels through
which it pa&s;&s;ed while they continued in the womb.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all animals have their eyes clo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, for &s;ome days after being
brought into the <PB N="54" REF="56"> world. The infant opens them the
in&s;tant of its birth. However, it &s;eems to keep them fixed and idle; they
want that lu&s;tre which they acquire by degrees; and if they happen to move,
is is rather an accidental gaze than an ex|ertion of the act of &s;eeing. The
light alone &s;eems to make the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon them. The eyes
of infants are &s;ometimes found turned to the place where it is &s;tronge&s;t;
and the pu|pil is &s;een to dilate and dimini&s;h, as in grown per&s;ons, in
proportion to the quantity it re|ceives. But &s;till, the infant is incapable
of di|&s;tingui&s;hing objects; the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, like the re&s;t of
the &s;en&s;es, requires an habit before it becomes any way &s;erviceable. All
the &s;en&s;es mu&s;t be compared with each other, and mu&s;t be made to
correct the defects of one another, before they can give ju&s;t information. It
is probable, therefore, that if the infant could expre&s;s its own
&s;en&s;ations, it would give a very extraordinary de&s;cription of the
illu&s;ions which it &s;uffers from them. The &s;ight might, perhaps, be
repre&s;ented as inverting objects, or multi|plying them; the hearing,
in&s;tead of convey|ing one uniform tone, might be &s;aid to bring up an
interrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of noi&s;es; and the touch apparently would divide
one body into as many as there are fingers that gra&s;ped it. But 
<PB N="55" REF="57"> all the&s;e errors are lo&s;t in one common confu&s;ed
idea of exi&s;tence; and it is happy for the infant, that it then can make but
very little u&s;e of its &s;en&s;es, when they could &s;erve only to bring it
fal&s;e information.</P>
<P>If there be any di&s;tinct &s;en&s;ations, tho&s;e of pain &s;eem to
be much more frequent and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of plea&s;ure. The infant's
cries are &s;ufficient indications of the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es it mu&s;t at every
interval endure; while, in the beginning, it has got no external marks to
te&s;tify its &s;atisfactions. It is not till after forty days that it is
&s;een to &s;mile; and not till that time al&s;o, the tears begin to appear,
its former expre&s;&s;ions of unea&s;ine&s;s being always without them. As to
any other marks of the pa&s;&s;ions, the infant being as yet almo&s;t without
them, it can expre&s;s none of them in its vi&s;age; which, except in the act
of crying and laughing, is fixed in a &s;ettled &s;erenity. All the other parts
of the body &s;eem equally relaxed and feeble: its motions are uncertain, and
its po&s;tures with|out choice; it is unable to &s;tand upright; its hams are
yet bent, from the habit which it re|ceived from its po&s;ition in the womb; it
has not &s;trength enough in its arms to &s;tretch them for|ward, much le&s;s
to gra&s;p any thing with its hands; it re&s;ts ju&s;t in the po&s;ture it is
laid; <PB N="56" REF="58"> and, if abandoned, mu&s;t &s;till continue in the
&s;ame po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, though this be the de&s;cription of infancy among
mankind in general, there are countries, and races, among whom infancy does not
&s;eem marked with &s;uch utter imbecillity, but where the children, not long
after they are born, appear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater &s;hare of
&s;elf-&s;upport. The children of Negroes have a &s;ur|prizing degree of this
premature indu&s;try: they are able to walk at two months; or, at lea&s;t, to
move from one place to another: they al&s;o hang to the mother's back without
any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and &s;eize the brea&s;t over her &s;houlder, continuing
in this po&s;ture till &s;he thinks proper to lay them down. This is very
different in the children of our countries, that &s;eldom are able to walk
under a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of children newly brought forth, is always red,
proceeding from its tran&s;parency, by which the blood beneath appears more
con|&s;picuous. Some &s;ay that this redne&s;s is greate&s;t in tho&s;e
children that are afterwards about to have the fine&s;t complexions; and it
&s;tands to rea&s;on that it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;ince the thinne&s;t &s;kins
are always the faire&s;t. The &s;ize of a new|born infant is generally about
twenty inches, and its weight about twelve pounds. The head <PB N="57" REF="59"> is large, and all the members delicate, &s;oft, and puffy. The&s;e
appearances alter with its age; as it grows older, the head becomes le&s;s in
pro|portion to the re&s;t of the body; the fle&s;h har|dens; the bones, that
before birth grew very thick in proportion, now lengthen by degrees, and the
human figure more and more acquires its due dimen&s;ions. In &s;uch children,
however, as are but feeble or &s;ickly, the head always con|tinues too big for
the body; the heads of dwarfs being extremely large in proportion.</P>
<P>Infants, when newly born, pa&s;s mo&s;t of their time in &s;leeping,
and awake with crying, ex|cited either by &s;en&s;ations of pain, or of hunger.
Man, when come to maturity, but rarely feels the want of food, as eating twice
or thrice in the four and twenty hours is known to &s;uffice the mo&s;t
voracious: but the infant may be con&s;ider|ed as a little glutton, who&s;e
only plea&s;ure con|&s;i&s;ts in its appetite; and this, except when it
&s;leeps, it is never ea&s;y without &s;atisfying. Thus Nature has adapted
different de&s;ires to the dif|ferent periods of life; each as it &s;eems
mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary for human &s;upport or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. While the animal
is yet forming, hunger excites it to that &s;upply which is nece&s;&s;ary for
its growth; when it is completely formed, a different ap|petite takes place,
that incites it to communicate <PB N="58" REF="60"> exi&s;tence. The&s;e two
de&s;ires take up the whole attention at different periods, but are very
&s;el|dom found to prevail &s;trongly together in the &s;ame age; one
plea&s;ure ever &s;erving to repre&s;s the other: and, if we find a per&s;on of
full age, placing a principal part of his happine&s;s in the nature and
quantity of his food, we have &s;trong rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect, that with
re&s;pect to his other appetites, he &s;till retains a part of the imbecillity
of his childhood.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary enough, however, that in|fants, who are thus
more voracious than grown per&s;ons, are neverthele&s;s more capable of
&s;u&s;tain|ing hunger. We have &s;everal in&s;tances, in ac|cidental ca&s;es
of famine, in which the child has been known to &s;urvive the parent; and they
have been &s;een clinging to the brea&s;t of their dead mother. Their little
bodies al&s;o, are more patient of cold; and we have &s;imilar in|&s;tances of
the mother's peri&s;hing in the &s;now, while the infant has been found alive
be&s;ide her. However, if we examine the internal &s;tructure of infants, we
&s;hall find an obvious rea&s;on for both the&s;e advantages. Their
blood-ve&s;&s;els are known to be much larger than in adults; and their nerves
much thicker and &s;ofter: thus, being furni&s;hed with a more copious quantity
of juices, both of the nervous and &s;anguinary <PB N="59" REF="61"> kinds, the
infant finds a temporary &s;u&s;tenance in this &s;uperfluity, and does not
expire till both are exhau&s;ted. The circulation al&s;o being larger and
quicker, &s;upplies it with proportion|able warmth, &s;o that it is more
capable of re|&s;i&s;ting the accidental rigours of the weather.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t nouri&s;hment of infants is well known to be the
mother's milk; and, what is remark|able, the infant it&s;elf has milk in its
own brea&s;ts, which may be &s;queezed out by compre&s;&s;ion: this
nouri&s;hment becomes le&s;s grateful as the child gathers &s;trength; and
perhaps, al&s;o, more unwhole&s;ome. However, in cold countries, which are
unfavourable to propagation, and where the female has &s;eldom above three or
four children at the mo&s;t, during her life, &s;he continues to &s;uckle the
child for four or five years together. In this manner the mothers of Canada and
Greenland are often &s;een &s;uckling two or three children, of different ages,
at a time.</P>
<P>The life of infants is very precarious, till the age of three or
four, from which time it be|comes more &s;ecure; and when a child arrives at
its &s;eventh year, it is then con&s;idered as a more certain life, as Mr.
Buffon a&s;&s;erts, than at any other age whatever. It appears, from
Simp&s;on's Tables, that of a certain number of children <PB N="60" REF="62">
born at the &s;ame time, a fourth part are found dead, at the end of the
fir&s;t year; more than two thirds at the end of the &s;econd; and, at lea&s;t,
half, at the end of the third: &s;o that tho&s;e who live to be above three
years old, are indulged a longer term than half the re&s;t of their
fellow-creatures. Neverthele&s;s, life, at that period, may be con&s;idered as
mere animal exi&s;tence; and rather a preparation for, than an enjoyment of
tho&s;e &s;atisfactions, both of mind and body, that make life of real value:
and hence it is more natural for mankind to deplore a fellow-creature, cut off
in the bloom of life, than one dying in early infancy. The one, by living up to
youth, and thus wading through the di&s;ad|vantageous parts of exi&s;tence,
&s;eems to have earned a &s;hort continuance of its enjoyments; the infant, on
the contrary, has &s;erved but a &s;hort apprentice&s;hip to pain; and, when
taken away, may be con&s;idered as re&s;cued from a long continuance of
mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very remarkable in the growth of the human
body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. iv. p. 173.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
embryo in the womb continues to encrea&s;e &s;till more and more, till it is
born. On the other hand, the child's growth is le&s;s every year, till the time
of puberty, when it &s;eems to &s;tart up of a &s;udden. <PB N="61" REF="63">
Thus, for in&s;tance, the embryo, which is an inch long, in the fir&s;t month,
grows but one inch and a quarter in the &s;econd; it then grows one and an half
in the third; two and an half in the fourth; and in this manner it keeps
en|crea&s;ing, till in the la&s;t month of its continuance it is actually found
to grow four inches; and, in the whole, about eighteen inches long. But it is
otherwi&s;e with the child when born: if we &s;uppo&s;e it eighteen inches at
that time, it grows, in the fir&s;t year, &s;ix or &s;even inches; in the
&s;econd year, it grows but four inches; in the third year, about three; and
&s;o on, at the rate of about an inch and an half, or two inches, each year,
till the time of puberty, when Nature &s;eems to make one great la&s;t effort,
to complete her work, and unfold the whole animal ma|chine.</P>
<P>The growth of the mind in children &s;eems to corre&s;pond with that
of the body. The comparative progre&s;s of the under&s;tanding is greater in
infants than in children of three or four years old. If we only reflect a
moment on the amazing acqui&s;itions that an infant makes in the fir&s;t and
&s;econd years of life, we &s;hall have much cau&s;e for wonder. Being &s;ent
into a world where every thing is new and unknown, the fir&s;t months of life
are &s;pent in a kind of <PB N="62" REF="64"> torpid amazement; an attention
di&s;tracted by the multiplicity of objects that pre&s;s to be known. The
fir&s;t labour, therefore, of the little learner is, to correct the illu&s;ions
of the &s;en&s;es, to di&s;tingui&s;h one object from another, and to exert the
memory, &s;o as to know them again. In this manner a child of a year old has
already made a thou&s;and experiments; all which it has properly ranged, and
di&s;tinctly re|members. Light, heat, fire, &s;weets, and bit|ters, &s;ounds
&s;oft or terrible, are all di&s;tingui&s;hed at the end of a very few months.
Be&s;ides this, every per&s;on the child knows, every individual object it
becomes fond of, its rattles, or its bells, may be all con&s;idered as &s;o
many new le&s;&s;ons to the young mind, with which it has not become
acquainted, without repeated exertions of the under&s;tanding. At this period
of life, the knowledge of every individual object cannot be acquired without
the &s;ame effort which, when grown up, is employed upon the mo&s;t ab&s;tract
idea: every thing the child hears or &s;ees, all the marks and characters of
nature, are as much un|known, and require the &s;ame attention to attain, as if
the reader were &s;et to under&s;tand the cha|racters of an Ethiopic
manu&s;cript: and yet we &s;ee in how &s;hort a time the little &s;tudent
begins <PB N="63" REF="65"> to under&s;tand them all, and to give evident marks
of early indu&s;try.</P>
<P>It is very amu&s;ing to pur&s;ue the young mind, while employed in
its fir&s;t attainments. At about a year old, the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities that
fir&s;t engaged its faculties, encrea&s;e, as its acquaint|ance with nature
enlarges. Its &s;tudies, there|fore, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, are no
way re|laxed; for having experienced what gave plea|&s;ure at one time, it
de&s;ires a repetition of it from the &s;ame object; and, in order to obtain
this, that object mu&s;t be pointed out: here, therefore, a new nece&s;&s;ity
ari&s;es, which, very often, neither its little arts nor importunities can
remove; &s;o that the child is at la&s;t obliged to &s;et about naming the
objects it de&s;ires to po&s;&s;e&s;s or avoid. In beginning to &s;peak, which
is u&s;ually about a year old, children find a thou|&s;and difficulties. It is
not without repeated trials that they come to pronounce any one of the letters;
nor without an effort of the me|mory, that they can retain them. For this
rea|&s;on, we frequently &s;ee them attempting a &s;ound which they had
learned, but forgot; and when they have failed, I have often &s;een their
attempt attended with apparent confu&s;ion. The letters &s;oone&s;t learned,
are tho&s;e which are mo&s;t ea&s;ily formed; thus A and B require an obvious
di&s;|po&s;ition <PB N="64" REF="66"> of the organs, and their pronunciation is
con&s;equently &s;oon attained. Z and R, which require a more complicated
po&s;ition, are learned with greater difficulty. And this may, perhaps, be the
rea&s;on why the children in &s;ome countries &s;peak &s;ooner than in others;
for the letters mo&s;tly occurring in the language of one country, being &s;uch
as are of ea&s;y pronunciation, that language is of cour&s;e more ea&s;ily
attained. In this manner the children of the Italians are &s;aid to &s;peak
&s;ooner than tho&s;e of the Germans; the language of the one being &s;mooth
and open; that of the other, crowded with con&s;onants, and extremely
gutteral.</P>
<P>But be this as it will, in all countries, children are found able to
expre&s;s the greate&s;t part of their wants by the time they arrive at two
years old; and from the moment the nece&s;&s;ity of learning new words
cea&s;es, they relax their in|du&s;try. It is then that the mind, like the
body, &s;eems every year to make &s;low advances; and, in order to &s;pur up
attention, many &s;y&s;tems of education have been contrived.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every philo&s;opher who has written on the education of
children, has been willing to point out a method of his own, chiefly
profe&s;&s;ing to advance the health, and improve the intellects at the &s;ame
time. The&s;e are u&s;ually found to <PB N="65" REF="67"> begin with finding
nothing right in the common practice; and by urging a total reformation. In
con&s;equence of this, nothing can be more wild or imaginary than their various
&s;y&s;tems of improvement. Some will have the children every day plunged in
cold water, in order to &s;trengthen their bodies; they will have them
conver&s;e with the &s;ervants in nothing but the Latin language, in order to
&s;trengthen their minds; every hour of the day mu&s;t be appointed for its own
&s;tudies, and the child mu&s;t learn to make the&s;e very &s;tudies an
amu&s;ement; till about the age of ten or eleven it becomes a prodigy of
premature improvement. Quite oppo&s;ite to this, we have others, whom the
courte&s;y of man|kind al&s;o calls philo&s;ophers: and they will have the
child learn nothing till the age of ten or eleven, at which the former has
attained &s;o much perfection; with them the mind is to be kept empty, until it
has a proper di&s;tinction of &s;ome metaphy&s;ical ideas about truth; and the
promi&s;ing pupil is debarred the u&s;e of even his own faculties, le&s;t they
&s;hould conduct him into prejudice and error. In this manner, &s;ome men, whom
fa&s;hion has celebrated for profound and fine thinkers, have given their
hazarded and untried conjectures, upon one of the mo&s;t im|portant &s;ubjects
in the world, and the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting <PB N="66" REF="68"> to humanity.
When men &s;peculate at liberty upon innate ideas, or the ab&s;tracted
di&s;tinctions between will and power, they may be permitted to enjoy their
&s;y&s;tems at plea&s;ure, as they are harmle&s;s, although they may be wrong;
but when they alledge that children are to be every day plunged in cold water,
and, whatever be their con&s;titution, indi&s;criminately enured to cold and
moi&s;ture; that they are to be kept wet in the feet, to prevent their
catch|ing cold; and never to be corrected when young, for fear of breaking
their &s;pirits when old; the&s;e are &s;uch noxious errors, that all
rea&s;onable men &s;hould endeavour to oppo&s;e them. Many have been the
children whom the&s;e opinions, begun in &s;peculation, have injured or
de&s;troyed in practice; and I have my&s;elf &s;een many a little
philo&s;ophical martyr, whom I wi&s;hed, but was unable to relieve.</P>
<P>If any &s;y&s;tem be now therefore nece&s;&s;ary, it is one that
would &s;erve to &s;hew, a very plain point; that very little &s;y&s;tem is
nece&s;&s;ary. The natural and common cour&s;e of education is in every
re&s;pect the be&s;t: I mean that in which the child is permitted to play among
its little equals, from who&s;e &s;imilar in&s;tructions it often gains the
mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;tores of knowledge. A child is not idle becau&s;e it is
playing about the <PB N="67" REF="69"> fields, or pur&s;uing a butterfly; it is
all this time &s;toring its mind with objects, upon the nature, the properties,
and the relations of which future curio&s;ity may &s;peculate.</P>
<P>I have ever found it a vain ta&s;k to try to make a child's learning
its amu&s;ement; nor do I &s;ee what good end it would an&s;wer were it
actually attained. The child, as was &s;aid, ought to have its &s;hare of play,
and it will be benefited thereby; and for every rea&s;on al&s;o, it ought to
have its &s;hare of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus
accu&s;tomed to fatigues and &s;ubordination; and whatever be the per&s;on's
future employment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it: he will be
thus enabled to &s;upport the drudgeries of office with content; or to fill up
the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, &s;hould by times be
put to its duty; and be taught to know, that the ta&s;k is to be done, or the
puni&s;hment to be endured. I do not object again&s;t alluring it to duty by
re|ward; but we well know, that the mind will be more &s;trongly &s;timulated
by pain; and both may, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, take their turn to operate. In
this manner, a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and labouring with
them at &s;chool, will acquire more health and knowledge <PB N="68" REF="70">
than by being bred up under the wing of any &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem-maker; and
will be thus qua|lified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true,
indeed, that when educated in this manner, the boy may not be &s;o &s;eemingly
&s;en&s;ible and forward as one bred up under &s;olitary in&s;truc|tion; and,
perhaps, this early forwardne&s;s, is more engaging than u&s;eful. It is well
known, that many of tho&s;e children who have been &s;uch prodigies of
literature before ten, have not made an adequate progre&s;s to twenty. It
&s;hould &s;eem, that they only began learning manly things before their time;
and, while others were bu&s;ied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their
age and curio&s;ity, the&s;e were forced upon &s;ubjects un&s;uited to their
years; and, upon that account alone, appearing extra|ordinary. The &s;tock of
knowledge in both may be equal; but with this difference, that each is yet to
learn what the other knows.</P>
<P>But whatever may have been the acqui&s;itions of children at ten or
twelve, their greate&s;t, and mo&s;t rapid progre&s;s, is made when they arrive
near the age of puberty. It is then that all the powers of nature &s;eem at
work in &s;trengthening the mind, and completing the body: the youth acquires
courage, and the virgin mode&s;ty; the <PB N="69" REF="71"> mind, with new
&s;en&s;ations, a&s;&s;umes new powers; it conceives with greater force, and
remembers with greater tenacity. About this time, there|fore, which is various
in different countries, more is learned in one year than in any two of the
preceding: and on this age, in particular, the greate&s;t weight of
in&s;truction ought to be thrown.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Puberty.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often &s;aid, that the &s;ea&s;on of youth is the
&s;ea&s;on of plea&s;ures: but this can only be true in &s;avage countries,
where but little pre|paration is made for the perfection of human nature; and
where the mind has but a very &s;mall part in the enjoyment. It is otherwi&s;e
in tho&s;e places where nature is carried to the highe&s;t pitch of refinement,
in which this &s;ea&s;on of the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ual delight is wi&s;ely made
&s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ucceeding, and more rational one of manhood. Youth,
with us, is but a &s;cene of preparation; a drama, upon the right conduct of
which all future happine&s;s is to de|pend. The youth who follows his
appetites, too &s;oon &s;eizes the cup, before it has received its be&s;t
ingredients; and, by anticipating his plea&s;ures, robs the remaining parts of
life of their &s;hare; &s;o that his eagerne&s;s only pro|duces a manhood of
imbecility, and an age of pain.</P>
<P>The time of puberty is different in various countries, and always
more late in men than in women. In the warm countries, of India, the 
<PB N="71" REF="73"> women are marriageable at nine or ten, and the men at
twelve or thirteen. It is al&s;o dif|ferent in cities where the inhabitants
lead a more &s;oft, luxurious life, from the country where they work harder,
and fare le&s;s deli|cately. Its &s;ymptoms are &s;eldom alike in dif|ferent
per&s;ons; but it is u&s;ually known by a welling of the brea&s;ts in one
&s;ex, and a rough|ne&s;s of the voice in the other. At this &s;ea&s;on al&s;o,
the women &s;eem to acquire new beauty, while the men lo&s;e all that delicate
effeminacy of countenance which they had when boys.</P>
<P>All countries, in proportion as they are ci|vilized, or barbarous,
improve, or degrade the nuptial &s;atisfaction. In tho&s;e mi&s;erable regions,
where &s;trength makes the only law, the &s;tronger &s;ex exerts its power, and
becomes the tyrant over the weaker: while the inhabitant of Ne|groland is
indolently taking his plea&s;ure in the fields, his wife is obliged to till the
grounds, that &s;erve for their mutual &s;upport. It is thus in all barbarous
countries, where the men throw all the laborious duties of life upon the
wo|men; and, regardle&s;s of beauty, put the &s;ofter &s;ex to tho&s;e
employments that mu&s;t effectually de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>But, in countries that are half barbarous, particularly wherever
Mahometani&s;m prevails, <PB N="72" REF="74"> the men run into the very
oppo&s;ite extreme Equally brutal with the former, they exert their tyranny
over the weaker &s;ex, and con&s;ider that half of the human creation as merely
made to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the depraved de&s;ires of the other. The chief,
and indeed the only aim of an A&s;iatic, is to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of many women;
and to be able to furni&s;h a &s;eraglio is the only tendency of his ambition.
As the &s;avage was totally regardle&s;s of beauty, he, on the contrary, prizes
it too highly; he excludes the per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;uch
per&s;onal attractions, from any &s;hare in the duties, or employments of life;
and, as if willing to engro&s;s all beauty to him&s;elf, en|crea&s;es the
number of his captives in proportion to the progre&s;s of his fortune. In this
manner he vainly expects to augment his &s;atisfactions, by &s;eeking from many
that happine&s;s which he ought to look for in the &s;ociety of one alone. He
lives a gloomy tyrant, amid&s;t wretches of his own making; he feels none of
tho&s;e endearments which &s;pring from affection, none of tho&s;e de|licacies
which ari&s;e from knowledge. His mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es, being &s;hut out from the
world, and to|tally ignorant of all that pa&s;&s;es there, have no arts to
entertain his mind, or calm his anxieties; the day pa&s;&s;es with them in
&s;ullen &s;ilence, or languid repo&s;e; appetite can furni&s;h but few
op|portunities <PB N="73" REF="75"> of varying the &s;cene; and all that falls
beyond it mu&s;t be irk&s;ome expectation.</P>
<P>From this avarice of women, if I may be al|lowed to expre&s;s it
&s;o, has proceeded that jea|lou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion which ever attends the
mi&s;er: hence tho&s;e low and barbarous methods of keeping the women of
tho&s;e countries guard|ed, and of making, and procuring eunuchs to attend
them. The&s;e unhappy creatures are of two kinds, the white and the black. The
white are generally made in the country where they re&s;ide, being but partly
deprived of the marks of virility; the black are generally brought from the
interior parts of Africa, and are made en|tirely bare. The&s;e are chiefly
cho&s;en for their deformity; the thicker the lips, the flatter the no&s;e, and
the more black the teeth, the more valuable the eunuch; &s;o that the vile
jealou&s;y of mankind here inverts the order of Nature; and the poor wretch
finds him&s;elf va|lued in proportion to his deficiencies. In Italy, where this
barbarous cu&s;tom is &s;till retained, and eunuchs are made, in order to
improve the voice, the laws are &s;everely aimed again&s;t &s;uch practice;
&s;o that being entirely prohibited, none but the poore&s;t, and mo&s;t
abandoned of the people, &s;till &s;ecretly practi&s;e it upon their chil|dren.
Of tho&s;e &s;erved in this manner, not one <PB N="74" REF="76"> in ten is
found to become a &s;inger; but &s;uch is the luxurious folly of the times,
that the &s;uc|ce&s;s of one amply compen&s;ates for the failure of the re&s;t.
It is very difficult to account for the alterations which ca&s;tration makes in
the voice, and the other parts of the body. The eunuch is &s;haped differently
from others. His legs are of an equal thickne&s;s above and below; his knees
weak; his &s;houlders narrow; and his beard thin and downy. In this manner his
per|&s;on is rendered more deformed; but his de&s;ires, as I am told, &s;till
continue the &s;ame; and ac|tually, in A&s;ia, &s;ome of them are found to have
their &s;eraglios, as well as their ma&s;ters. Even in our country, we have an
in&s;tance of a very fine woman's being married to one of them, who&s;e
appearance was the mo&s;t unpro|mi&s;ing; and, what is more extraordinary
&s;till, I am told, that this couple continue perfectly happy in each other's
&s;ociety.</P>
<P>The mere nece&s;&s;ities of life &s;eem the only aim of the
&s;avage; the &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures are the only &s;tudy of the
&s;emi-barbarian; but the re|finement of &s;en&s;uality, by rea&s;on, is the
boa&s;t of real politene&s;s. Among the merely barbarous nations, &s;uch as the
natives of Madaga&s;car, or the inhabitants of Congo, nothing is de&s;ired &s;o
ardently as to pro&s;titute their wives, or <PB N="75" REF="77"> daughters, to
&s;trangers, for the mo&s;t trifling advantages; they will account it a
di&s;honour not to be among the foremo&s;t who are thus received into favour;
on the other hand, the Mahometan keeps his wife faithful, by confin|ing her
per&s;on; and would in&s;tantly put her to death if he but &s;u&s;pected her
cha&s;tity. With the politer inhabitants of Europe both the&s;e barbarous
extremes are avoided; the woman's per&s;on is left free, and no con&s;traint is
impo&s;ed but upon her affections. The pa&s;&s;ion of love, which may be
con&s;idered as the nice conduct of ruder de&s;ire, is only known, and
practi&s;ed in this part of the world; &s;o that what other na|tions guard as
their right, the more delicate European is contented to a&s;k as a favour. In
this manner, the concurrence of mutual appe|tite contributes to encrea&s;e
mutual &s;atisfaction; and the power on one &s;ide of refu&s;ing, makes every
ble&s;&s;ing more grateful when obtained by the other. In barbarous countries,
woman is con&s;idered merely as an u&s;eful &s;lave; in &s;uch as are
&s;omewhat more refined, &s;he is regarded as a de&s;ireable toy; in countries
entirely po|li&s;hed, &s;he enjoys ju&s;ter privileges; the wife being
con&s;idered as an u&s;eful friend, and an agreeable mi&s;tre&s;s. Her mind is
&s;till more prized than her per&s;on; and without the im|provement

<PB N="75" REF="79"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="76" REF="80"> of both, &s;he can never expect to be|come truly
agreeable; for her good &s;en&s;e alone can pre&s;erve what &s;he has gained by
her beauty.</P>
<P>Female beauty, as was &s;aid, is always &s;een to improve about the
age of puberty: but, if we &s;hould attempt to define in what this beauty
con|&s;i&s;ts or what con&s;titutes its perfection, we &s;hould find nothing
more difficult to determine. Every country has its peculiar way of thinking, in
this re&s;pect; and even the &s;ame country thinks differently, at different
times. The ancients had a very different ta&s;te from what prevails at
pre&s;ent. The eye-brows joining in the middle was con&s;idered as a very
peculiar grace, by Ti|bullus, in the enumeration of the charms of his
mi&s;tre&s;s. Narrow foreheads were approved of, and &s;carce any of the Roman
ladies that are celebrated for their other perfections, but are al&s;o
prai&s;ed for the redne&s;s of their hair. The no&s;e al&s;o of the Grecian
Venus, was &s;uch as would appear at pre&s;ent an actual deformity; as it fell
in a &s;traight line from the forehead, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;inking
between the eyes; without which we never &s;ee a face at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Among the moderns, every country &s;eems to have peculiar ideas of
beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. The Per&s;ians
admire large eye-brows, joining in the middle; <PB N="77" REF="81"> the edges
and corners of the eyes are tinctured with black, and the &s;ize of the head is
encrea&s;ed by a great variety of bandages, formed into a turban. In &s;ome
parts of India, black teeth and white hair, are de&s;ired with ardour; and one
of the principal employments of the women of Thibet, is to redden the teeth
with herbs, and to make their hair white by a certain pre|paration. The
pa&s;&s;ion for coloured teeth ob|tains al&s;o in China, and Japan; where, to
com|plete their idea of beauty, the object of de&s;ire mu&s;t have little eyes,
nearly clo&s;ed, feet ex|tremely &s;mall, and a wai&s;t far from being
&s;hapely. There are &s;ome nations of the Ame|rican Indians, that flatten the
heads of their chil|dren, by keeping them, while young, &s;queezed between two
boards, &s;o as to make the vi&s;age much larger than it would naturally be.
Others flatten the head at top; and others &s;till make it as round as they
po&s;&s;ibly can. The inhabitants along the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa, have
a very extraordinary ta&s;te for beauty. A flat no&s;e, thick lips, and a jet
black complexion, are there the mo&s;t indulgent gifts of Nature. Such,
in|deed, they are all, in &s;ome degree, found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. However, they
take care, by art, to encrea&s;e the&s;e natural deformities, as they &s;hould
&s;eem to us; and they have many additional <PB N="78" REF="82"> methods of
rendering their per&s;ons &s;till more frightfully plea&s;ing. The whole body
and vi|&s;age is often &s;carred with a variety of mon|&s;trous figures; which
is not done without great pain, and repeated inci&s;ion; and even &s;ome|times,
parts of the body are cut away. But it would be endle&s;s to remark the various
arts which caprice, or cu&s;tom, has employed to di|&s;tort and disfigure the
body, in order to ren|der it more plea&s;ing: in fact, every nation, how
barbarous &s;oever, &s;eems un&s;atisfied with the hu|man figure, as Nature has
left it, and has its peculiar arts of heightening beauty. Painting, powdering,
cutting, boring the no&s;e, and the ears, lengthening the one, and
depre&s;&s;ing the other, are arts practi&s;ed in many countries; and, in
&s;ome degree, admired in all. The&s;e arts might have been at fir&s;t
introduced to hide epi|demic deformities; cu&s;tom, by degrees, re|conciles
them to the view; till, from looking upon them with indifference, the eye at
length begins to gaze with plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Age of Manhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
chapter is tran&s;lated from Mr. Buffon, who&s;e de|&s;cription is very
excellent. Whatever I have added is marked by inverted commas, "thus." And in
whatever trifling points I have differed, the notes will &s;erve to
&s;hew.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE human body attains to its full height during the age of puberty;
or, at lea&s;t, a &s;hort time after. Some young people are found to cea&s;e
growing at fourteen, or fifteen; others continue their growth till two or three
and twenty. During this period they are all of a &s;lender make; their thighs
and legs &s;mall, and the mu&s;cular parts as yet unfilled. But, by degrees,
the fle&s;hy fibres augment; the mu&s;cles &s;well, and a&s;&s;ume their
figure; the limbs be|come proportioned, and rounder; and, before the age of
thirty, the body, in men, has ac|quired the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymmetry. In
women, the body arrives at perfection much &s;ooner, as they arrive at the age
of maturity more early; the mu&s;cles, and all the other parts being weaker,
le&s;s compact, and &s;olid, than tho&s;e of man, they require le&s;s time in
coming to per|fection; and, as they are le&s;s in &s;ize, that &s;ize 
<PB N="80" REF="84"> is &s;ooner completed. Hence the per&s;ons of women are
found to be as complete at twenty, as tho&s;e of men are found to be at
thirty.</P>
<P>The body of a well-&s;haped man ought to be &s;quare; the mu&s;cles
&s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed with boldne&s;s, and the lines of the face &s;trongly
marked. In the woman, all the colours &s;hould be rounder, the lines &s;ofter,
and the features more delicate. Strength and maje&s;ty belong to the man, grace
and &s;oftne&s;s are the peculiar embelli&s;hments of the other &s;ex. In both,
every part of their form declares their &s;overeignty over other creatures. Man
&s;upports his body erect; his attitude is that of command; and his face, which
is turned towards the heavens, di&s;|plays the dignity of his &s;tation. The
image of his &s;oul is painted in his vi&s;age; and the excellence of his
nature penetrates through the material form in which it is enclo&s;ed. His
maje&s;tic port, his &s;edate, and re&s;olute &s;tep, announce the noblene&s;s
of his rank. He touches the earth only with his extremity; and beholds it as if
at a di&s;dainful di&s;tance. His arms are not given him, as to other
creatures, for pillars of &s;up|port; nor does he lo&s;e, by rendering them
cal|lous again&s;t the ground, that delicacy of touch which furni&s;hes him
with &s;o many of his enjoy|ments. His hands are made for very different 
<PB N="81" REF="85"> purpo&s;es; to &s;econd every intention of his will, and
to perfect the gifts of Nature.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is at re&s;t, all the features of the vi&s;age
&s;eem &s;ettled in a &s;tate of profound tran|quility. Their proportion, their
union, and their harmony &s;eem to mark the &s;weet &s;erenity of the mind, and
give a true information of what pa&s;&s;es within. But, when the &s;oul is
excited, the human vi&s;age becomes a living picture; where the pa&s;&s;ions
are expre&s;&s;ed with as much delicacy as energy, where every motion is
de|&s;igned by &s;ome corre&s;pondent feature, where every impre&s;&s;ion
anticipates the will, and be|trays tho&s;e hidden agitations, that he would
often wi&s;h to conceal.</P>
<P>It is particularly in the eyes that the pa&s;&s;ions are painted;
and in which we may mo&s;t readily di&s;cover their beginning. The eye &s;eems
to be|long to the &s;oul more than any other organ; it &s;eems to participate
of all its emotions; as well the mo&s;t &s;oft and tender, as the mo&s;t
tumul|tuous and forceful. It not only receives, but tran&s;mits them by
&s;ympathy; the ob&s;erving eye of one catches the &s;ecret fire from another;
and the pa&s;&s;ion thus often becomes general.</P>
<P>Such per&s;ons as are &s;hort &s;ighted labour un|der a particular
di&s;advantage, in this re&s;pect. They are, in a manner, entirely cut off from
<PB N="82" REF="86"> the language of the eyes; and this gives an air of
&s;tupidity to the face, which often produces very unfavourable preventions.
However in|telligent we find &s;uch per&s;ons to be, we can &s;carcely be
brought back from our fir&s;t preju|dice, and often continue in the fir&s;t
erroneous opinion. In this manner we are too much in|duced to judge of men by
their phy&s;iognomy; and having, perhaps, at fir&s;t, caught up our judgments
prematurely, they mechanically in|fluence us all our lives after. This extends
even to the very colour, or the cut of people's cloaths; and we &s;hould for
this rea&s;on be care|ful, even in &s;uch trifling particulars, &s;ince they go
to make up a part of the total judgment which tho&s;e we conver&s;e with may
form to our advantage.</P>
<P>The vivacity, or the languid motion of the eyes, gives the
&s;tronge&s;t marks to phy&s;iog|nomy; and their colour contributes &s;till
more to enforce the expre&s;&s;ion. The different colours of the eye are the
dark hazle, the light hazle, the green, the blue, the grey, the whiti&s;h grey,

<Q REND="inline">"and al&s;o the red."</Q> The&s;e different colours
ari&s;e from the different colours of the little 
<Q REND="inline">"mu&s;cles that &s;erve to contract the pupil; and
they are very often found to change colour with di&s;order, and with
age."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="87">The mo&s;t ordinary colours are the hazle and
the blue, and very often both the&s;e colours are found in the eyes of the
&s;ame per&s;on. Tho&s;e eyes which are called black are only of the dark
hazle, which may be ea&s;ily &s;een upon clo&s;er in&s;pection; however,
tho&s;e eyes are reckoned the mo&s;t beautiful where the &s;hade is the
deepe&s;t; and either in the&s;e, or the blue eyes, the fire, which gives its
fine&s;t expre&s;&s;ion to the eye, is more di&s;tingui&s;hable in propor|tion
to the darkne&s;s of the tint. For this rea&s;on, the black eyes, as they are
called, have the greate&s;t vivacity; but, probably, the blue have the mo&s;t
powerful effect in beauty, as they re|flect a greater variety of lights, being
compo&s;ed of more various colours.</P>
<P>This variety, which is found in the colour of the eyes, is peculiar
to man, and one or two other kinds of animals; but, in general, the colour in
any one individual is the &s;ame in all the re&s;t. The eyes of oxen are brown;
tho&s;e of &s;heep of a water colour; tho&s;e of goats are grey; 
<Q REND="inline">"and it may al&s;o be, in general, re|marked, that
the eyes of mo&s;t white animals are red; thus the rabbit, the ferrit, and,
even in the human race, the white Moor, all have their eyes of a red
colour."</Q></P>
<P>Although the eye, when put into motion, <PB N="84" REF="88"> &s;eems
to be drawn on one &s;ide; yet it only moves round its centre; by which its
coloured part moves nearer, or farther from the angle of the eye-lids, or is
elevated or depre&s;t. The di&s;tance between the eyes is le&s;s in man than in
any other animal; and in &s;ome of them it is &s;o great that it is
impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould ever view the &s;ame object with both eyes at
once, unle&s;s it be very far off. 
<Q REND="inline">"This, however, in them, is rather an advantage than
an inconve|nience; as they are thus able to watch round them, and guard
again&s;t the dangers of their precarious &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P>Next to the eyes, the features, which mo&s;t give a character to the
face, are the eye-brows; which being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, more apparent than
the other features, are mo&s;t readily di|&s;tingui&s;hed at a di&s;tance. 
<Q REND="inline">"Le Brun, in giving a painter directions, with
regard to the pa&s;|&s;ions, places the principal expre&s;&s;ion of the face in
the eye brows. From their elevation and depre&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t of the furious
pa&s;&s;ions are characterized; and &s;uch as have this feature ex|tremely
moveable, are u&s;ually known to have an expre&s;&s;ive face. By means of
the&s;e we can imitate all the other pa&s;&s;ions, as they are rai&s;ed and
depre&s;&s;ed, at command; the re&s;t of the fea|tures are generally fixed; or,
when put into <PB N="85" REF="89"> motion, they do not obey the will; the mouth
and eyes, in an actor, for in&s;tance, may, by being violently di&s;torted,
give a very different expre&s;&s;ion from what he would intend; but the
eye-brows can &s;carcely be exerted improperly; their being rai&s;ed, denotes
all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which pride, or plea&s;ure in&s;pire; and their
de|pre&s;&s;ion marks tho&s;e which are the effects of contemplation and pain;
and &s;uch who have this feature, therefore, mo&s;t at command, are often found
to excel as actors."</Q></P>
<P>The eye-la&s;hes have an effect, in giving ex|pre&s;&s;ion to the
eye, particularly when long and clo&s;e; they &s;often its glances, and improve
its &s;weetne&s;s. Man and apes are the only animals that have eye-la&s;hes
both upon the upper and lower lids; all other animals want them on the lid
below.</P>
<P>The eye-lids &s;erve to guard the ball of the eye, and to furni&s;h
it with a proper moi&s;ture. The upper lid ri&s;es and falls; the lower has
&s;carce any motion; and although their being moved depends on the will, yet it
often hap|pens that the will is unable to keep them open, when &s;leep, or
fatigue, oppre&s;&s;es the mind. In birds, and amphibious quadrupedes, the
lower lid alone has motion; fi&s;hes and in&s;ects have no eye-lids
what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90">The forehead makes a large part of the face, and
a part which chiefly contributes to its beauty. It ought to be ju&s;tly
proportioned; neither too round nor too flat; neither too nar|row nor too low;
and the hair &s;hould come thick upon its extremities. It is known to every
body how much the hair tends to im|prove the face; and how much the being bald
&s;erves to take away from beauty. The highe&s;t part of the head is that which
becomes bald the &s;oone&s;t, as well as that part which lies imme|diately
above the temples. The hair under the temples, and at the back of the head, is
very &s;eldom known to fail, 
<Q REND="inline">"and women are much le&s;s apt to become bald than
men; Mr. Buffon &s;eems to think they never become bald at all; but we have too
many in&s;tances of the contrary among us, not very ea&s;ily to contradict the
a&s;&s;ertion. Of all parts, or appendages of the body, the hair is that which
is found mo&s;t different, in different climates; and often not only
contributes to mark the country, but al&s;o the di&s;po&s;ition of the man. It
is, in general, thicke&s;t where the con&s;titution is &s;tronge&s;t; and more
glo&s;&s;y and beautiful where the health is mo&s;t permanent. The ancients
held the hair to be a &s;ort of excrement, produced like the nails; the part
next the root pu&s;hing out that <PB N="87" REF="91"> immediately contiguous.
But the moderns have found that every hair may be truly &s;aid to live, to
receive nutriment, to fill and di&s;tend it&s;elf like the other parts of the
body. The roots, they ob&s;erve, do not turn grey &s;ooner than the
extremities, but the whole hair changes colour at once; and we have many
in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have grown grey in one night's time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon &s;ays that the hair begins to grow grey at the points,
but the fact is otherwi&s;e.</NOTE>. Each hair, if viewed with a micro|&s;cope,
is found to con&s;i&s;t of five or &s;ix le&s;&s;er ones, all wrapped up in one
common covering; it appears knotted, like &s;ome &s;orts of gra&s;s, and
&s;ends forth branches at the joints. It is bulbous at the root, by which it
imbibes its moi&s;ture from the body, and it is &s;plit at the points; &s;o
that a &s;ingle hair, at its end, re|&s;embles a bru&s;h. Whatever be the
&s;ize, or the &s;hape of the pore, through which the hair i&s;&s;ues, it
accommodates it&s;elf to the &s;ame; being either thick, as they are large;
&s;mall, as they are le&s;s; round, triangular, and variou&s;ly formed as the
pores happen to be various. The hair takes its colour from the juices flow|ing
through it; and it is found that this co|lour differs in different tribes and
races of people. The Americans, and the A&s;iatics, have <PB N="88" REF="92">
their hair black, thick, &s;traight, and &s;hining. The inhabitants of the
torrid climates of Africa, have it black, &s;hort, and woolly. The people of
Scandinavia have it red, long, and curled; and tho&s;e of our own, and the
neighbouring countries, are found with hair of various co|lours. However, it is
&s;uppo&s;ed by many, that every man re&s;embles in his di&s;po&s;ition the
inha|bitants of tho&s;e countries whom he re&s;embles in the colour, and the
nature of his hair; &s;o that the black are &s;aid, like the A&s;iatics, to be
grave and acute; the red, like the Gothic na|tions, to be cholerick and bold.
However this may be, the length and the &s;trength of the hair is a general
mark of a good con&s;titution; and as that hair which is &s;tronge&s;t is
mo&s;t com|monly curled, &s;o curled hair is generally re|garded among us as a
beauty. The Greeks, however, had a very different idea of beauty, in this
re&s;pect; and &s;eem to have taken one of their peculiar national
di&s;tinctions from the length and the &s;traightne&s;s of the hair."</Q></P>
<P>The no&s;e is the mo&s;t prominent feature in the face; but, as it
has &s;carce any motion, and that only in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, it
rather adds to the beauty than to the expre&s;&s;ion of the countenance. 
<Q REND="inline">"However, I am told, by the &s;kilful in this branch
of knowledge, that wide <PB N="89" REF="93"> no&s;trils add a great deal to the
bold and re|&s;olute air of the countenance; and where they are narrow, though
it may con&s;titute beauty, it &s;eldom improves expre&s;&s;ion."</Q> The form
of the no&s;e, and its advanced po&s;ition, are peculiar to the human vi&s;age
alone. Other animals, for the mo&s;t part, have no&s;trils, with a partition
between them; but none of them have an ele|vated no&s;e. Apes them&s;elves have
&s;carce any thing el&s;e of this feature, but the no&s;trils; the re&s;t of
the feature lying flat upon the vi&s;age, and &s;carce higher than the cheek
bones. 
<Q REND="inline">"A|mong all the tribes of &s;avage men al&s;o, the
no&s;e is very flat; and I have &s;een a Tartar who had &s;carce any thing

<P>The mouth and lips, next to the eyes, are found to have the
greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;ions have great power over this part of
the face; and the mouth marks its different degrees, by its different forms.
The organ of &s;peech &s;till more animates this part, and gives it more life
than any other feature in the countenance. The ruby colour of the lips, and the
white ena|mel of the teeth, give it &s;uch a &s;uperiority over every other
feature, that it &s;eems to make the principal object of our regards. In fact,
the whole attention is fixed upon the lips of the <PB N="90" REF="94">
&s;peaker; however rapid his di&s;cour&s;e, however various the &s;ubject, the
mouth takes corre|&s;pondent &s;ituations; and deaf men have been often found
to &s;ee the force of tho&s;e rea&s;onings which they could not hear,
under&s;tanding every word as it was &s;poken.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The under jaw in man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great
va|riety of motions; while the upper has been thought, by many, to be quite
immoveable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon is of this opinion. He &s;ays,
that the upper jaw is immoveable in all animals what&s;oever. How|ever, the
parrot is an obvious exception; and &s;o is man him&s;elf, as &s;hewn
above.</NOTE>. However, that it moves in man, a very ea&s;y ex|periment will
&s;uffice to convince us. If we keep the head fixed, with any thing between our
teeth, the edge of a table for in&s;tance, and then open our mouths, we &s;hall
find that both jaws recede from it at the &s;ame time; the upper jaw ri&s;es,
and the lower falls, and the table remains untouched between them. The upper
jaw, therefore, has motion as well as the under; and, what is remarkable, it
has its proper mu&s;cles behind the head, for thus rai&s;ing and depre&s;&s;ing
it. Whenever, therefore, we eat, both jaws move at the &s;ame time, though very
unequally; for the whole head moving with the upper jaw, of which it makes a
part, its motions are thus <PB N="91" REF="95"> le&s;s ob&s;ervable."</Q> In
the human embryo, the under jaw is very much advanced before the upper. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the adult, it hangs a good deal more backward;
and tho&s;e who&s;e upper and under row of teeth are equally prominent, and
&s;trike directly again&s;t each other, are what the painters call under-hung;
and they con&s;ider this as a great defect in beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon &s;ays, that both jaws, in a perfect face, &s;hould be
on a level: but this is denied by the be&s;t painters.</NOTE>. The under jaw in
a Chine&s;e face falls greatly more backward than with us; and, I am told, the
difference is half an inch, when the mouth is &s;hut naturally."</Q> In
in&s;tances of the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, the un|der jaw has often an
involuntary quivering mo|tion; and often al&s;o, a &s;tate of languor produces
another, which is that of yawning. 
<Q REND="inline">"Every one knows how very &s;ympathetic this kind of
languid motion is; and that for one per&s;on to yawn, is &s;ufficient to &s;et
all the re&s;t of the com|pany a yawning. A ridiculous in&s;tance of this was
commonly practi&s;ed upon the famous M'Laurin, one of the profe&s;&s;ors at
Edinburgh. He was very &s;ubject to have his jaw di&s;located; &s;o that when
he opened his mouth wider than ordinary, or when he yawned, he could not &s;hut
it again. In the mid&s;t of his harangues, there|fore, <PB N="92" REF="96"> if
any of his pupils began to be tired of his lecture, he had only to gape or
yawn, and the profe&s;&s;or in&s;tantly caught the &s;ympathetic affection;
&s;o that he thus continued to &s;tand &s;peechle&s;s, with his mouth wide
open, till his &s;ervant, from the next room, was called in to &s;et his jaw
again."</Q></P>
<P>When the mind reflects with regret upon &s;ome good unattained or
lo&s;t, it feels an internal emotion, which acting upon the diaphragm, and that
upon the lungs, produces a &s;igh; this, when the mind is &s;trongly affected,
is repeated; &s;or|row &s;ucceeds the&s;e fir&s;t emotions; and tears are often
&s;een to follow: &s;obbing is the &s;igh &s;till more invigorated; and
lamentation, or crying, proceeds from the continuance of the plaintive tone of
the voice, which &s;eems to implore pity. 
<Q REND="inline">"There is yet a &s;ilent agony, in which the mind
appears to di&s;dain all external help, and broods over its di&s;tre&s;&s;es
with gloomy re&s;erve. This is the mo&s;t dangerous &s;tate of mind; accidents
or friend&s;hip may le&s;&s;en the louder kinds of grief; but all remedies for
this, mu&s;t be had from within: and there, de&s;pair too often finds the
mo&s;t deadly enemy."</Q></P>
<P>Laughter is a &s;ound of the voice, interrupted and pur&s;ued for
&s;ome continuance. The mu&s;|cles of the belly, and the diaphragm, are
em|ployed <PB N="93" REF="97"> in its &s;lighte&s;t exertions; but tho&s;e of
the ribs are &s;trongly agitated in the louder: and the head &s;ometimes is
thrown backward, in order to rai&s;e them with greater ea&s;e. The &s;mile is
often an indication of kindne&s;s and good-will: it is al&s;o often u&s;ed as a
mark of contempt and ridicule.</P>
<P>Blu&s;hing proceeds from different pa&s;&s;ions; being produced by
&s;hame, anger, pride, and joy. Palene&s;s is often al&s;o the effect of anger;
and almo&s;t ever attendant on fright and fear. The&s;e alterations in the
colour of the coun|tenance, are entirely involuntary; all the other
expre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;ions are, in &s;ome &s;mall de|gree, under
controul; but blu&s;hing and pale|ne&s;s, betray our &s;ecret purpo&s;es; and
we might as well attempt to &s;top them, as the circulation of the blood, by
which they are cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>The whole head, as well as the features of the face, takes peculiar
attitudes from its pa&s;&s;ions: it bends forward, to expre&s;s humility,
&s;hame, or &s;orrow; it is turned to one &s;ide, in languor, or in pity; it is
thrown with the chin forward, in arrogance and pride; erect, in &s;elf-conceit,
and ob&s;tinacy; it is thrown backwards in a&s;toni&s;hment; and combines its
motions to the one &s;ide, and the other, to expre&s;s contempt, ridicule,
anger, and re&s;entment. 
<Q REND="inline">"Painters, <PB N="94" REF="98"> who&s;e &s;tudy
leads to the contemplation of ex|ternal forms, are much more adequate judges of
the&s;e than any naturali&s;t can be; and it is with the&s;e a general remark,
that no one pa&s;&s;ion is regularly expre&s;&s;ed on different countenances in
the &s;ame manner; but that grief often &s;its upon the face like joy; and
pride a&s;&s;umes the air of pa&s;&s;ion. It would be vain, therefore, in
words, to expre&s;s their general effect, &s;ince they are often as various as
the countenances they &s;it upon; and in making this di&s;tinction nicely, lies
all the &s;kill of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t. In being able to di&s;tingui&s;h what
part of the face is marked by nature, and what by the mind; what part has been
originally formed, and what is made by habit, con&s;titutes this &s;cience;
upon which the ancients &s;o much valued them&s;elves, and which we at
pre&s;ent &s;o little regard. Some, however, of the mo&s;t acute men among us,
have paid great attention to this art; and, by long practice, have been able to
give &s;ome cha|racter of every per&s;on who&s;e face they examined. Montaigne
is well known to have di&s;liked tho&s;e men who &s;hut one eye in looking upon
any ob|ject: and Fielding a&s;&s;erts, that he never knew a per&s;on with a
&s;teady glavering &s;mile, but he found him a rogue. However, mo&s;t of
the&s;e ob&s;ervations, tending to a di&s;covery of the mind 
<PB N="95" REF="99"> by the face, are merely capricious; and Nature has kindly
hid our hearts from each other, to keep us in good humour with our fellow
creatures."</Q></P>
<P>The parts of the head which give the lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ion to the
face, are the ears; and they are generally found hidden under the hair.
The&s;e, which are immoveable, and make &s;o &s;mall an appearance in man, are
very di&s;tin|gui&s;hing features in quadrupedes. They &s;erve in them as the
principal marks of the pa&s;&s;ions; the ears di&s;cover their joys or their
terrors, with tolerable preci&s;ion; and denote all their internal agitations.
The &s;malle&s;t ears, in men, are &s;aid to be mo&s;t beautiful; but the
large&s;t are found the be&s;t for hearing. There are &s;ome &s;avage nations
who bore their ears, and &s;o draw that part down, that the tips of the ears
are &s;een to re&s;t upon their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The &s;trange variety in the different cu&s;toms of men, appears
&s;till more extravagant in their manner of wearing their beards. Some, and
among others the Turks, cut the hair off their heads, and let their beards
grow. The Euro|peans, on the contrary, &s;have their beards, and wear their
hair. The Negroes &s;have their heads in figures at one time, in &s;tars at
another, in the manner of friars; and &s;till more com|monly in alternate
&s;tripes; and their little boys <PB N="96" REF="100"> are &s;haved in the
&s;ame manner. The Tala|poins, of Siam, &s;have the heads and the eye-brows of
&s;uch children as are committed to their care. Every nation &s;eems to have
enter|tained different prejudices, at different times, in favour of one part or
another of the beard. Some have admired the hair upon the cheeks on each
&s;ide, as we &s;ee with &s;ome low-bred men among our&s;elves, who want to be
fine. Some like the hair lower down; &s;ome chu&s;e it curled; and others like
it &s;trait. 
<Q REND="inline">"Some have cut it into a peak; and others &s;have
all but the whi&s;ker. This particular part of the beard was highly prized
among the Spaniards; till of late, a man without whi&s;kers was con&s;idered as
unfit for company; and where Nature had de|nied them, Art took care to &s;upply
the defi|ciency. We are told of a Spani&s;h general who, when he borrowed a
large &s;um of money from the Venetians, pawned his whi&s;ker, which he
afterwards took proper care to relea&s;e. King&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, that a
con&s;iderable part of the re|ligion of the Tartars con&s;i&s;ts in the
manage|ment of their whi&s;kers; and that they waged a long and bloody war with
the Per&s;ians, declar|ing them infidels, merely becau&s;e they would not give
their whi&s;kers the orthodox cut. The kings of Per&s;ia carried the care of
their beards <PB N="97" REF="101"> to a ridiculous exce&s;s, when they cho&s;e
to wear them matted with gold thread: and the kings of France them&s;elves, of
the fir&s;t races, had them knotted and buttoned with gold. But of all nations,
the Americans take the greate&s;t pains in cutting their hair, and plucking
their beards. The under part of the beard, and all but the whi&s;ker, they take
care to pluck up by the roots, &s;o that many have &s;uppo&s;ed them to have no
hair naturally growing on that part: and even Linnaeus him&s;elf has fallen
into that mi|&s;take. Their hair is al&s;o cut into bands; and no &s;mall care
employed in adju&s;ting the whi&s;ker. In fact, we have a very wrong idea of
&s;avage finery; and are apt to &s;uppo&s;e that, like the bea&s;ts of the
fore&s;t, they ri&s;e, and are dre&s;&s;ed with a &s;hake: but the rever&s;e is
true; for no birth-night beauty takes more time or pains in the adorning her
per&s;on, than they. I remember, when the Cherokee kings were over here, that I
have waited for three hours. during the time they were dre&s;&s;ing. They
ne|ver would venture to make their appearance till they had gone through the
tedious cere|monies of the toilet; they had their boxes of oil and oker, their
fat, and their perfumes, like the mo&s;t effeminate beau, and generally took up
four hours in dre&s;&s;ing, before they con|&s;idered <PB N="98" REF="102">
them&s;elves as fit to be &s;een. We mu&s;t not, therefore, con&s;ider a
delicacy in point of dre&s;s, as a mark of refinement, &s;ince &s;avages are
much more difficult in this particular, than the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable or tawdry
European. The more barbarous the people, the fonder of finery. In Europe, the
lu&s;tre of jewels, and the &s;plen|dor of the mo&s;t brilliant colours, are
generally given up to women, or to the weake&s;t part of the other &s;ex, who
are willing to be contempti|bly fine: but in A&s;ia, the&s;e trifling fineries
are eagerly &s;ought after by every condition of men; and, as the proverb has
it, we find the riche&s;t jewels in an Aethiop's ear. The pa&s;&s;ion for
glittering ornaments, is &s;till &s;tronger among the ab&s;olute barbarians,
who often exchange their whole &s;tock of provi&s;ions, and whatever el&s;e
they happen to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, with our &s;eamen, for a gla&s;s bead,
or a looking-gla&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Although fa&s;hions have ari&s;en in different countries from fancy
and caprice, the&s;e, when they become general, de&s;erve examination. Mankind
have always con&s;idered it as a matter of moment, and they will ever continue
de&s;irous of drawing the attention of each other, by &s;uch ornaments as mark
the riches, the power, or the courage of the wearer. The value of tho&s;e
&s;hining &s;tones which have at all times been <PB N="99" REF="103">
con&s;idered as precious ornaments, is entirely founded upon their
&s;carcene&s;s or their bril|liancy. It is the &s;ame likewi&s;e, with
re&s;pect to tho&s;e &s;hining metals, the weight of which is &s;o little
regarded, when &s;pread over our cloaths. The&s;e ornaments are rather
de&s;igned to draw the attention of others, than to add to any enjoyments of
our own; and few there are that the&s;e ornaments will not &s;erve to dazzle,
and who can coolly di&s;tingui&s;h between the metal and the man.</P>
<P>All things rare and brilliant, will, therefore, ever continue to be
fa&s;hionable, while men de|rive greater advantages from opulence than virtue;
while the means of appearing con&s;ider|able, are more ea&s;ily acquired, than
the title to be con&s;idered. The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion we gene|rally make,
ari&s;es from our dre&s;s; and this varies, in conformity to our inclinations,
and the manner in which we de&s;ire to be con&s;idered. The mode&s;t man, or he
who would wi&s;h to be thought &s;o, de&s;ires to &s;hew the &s;implicity of
his mind, by the plainne&s;s of his dre&s;s; the vain man, on the contrary,
takes a plea&s;ure in di&s;|playing his &s;uperiority, 
<Q REND="inline">"and is willing to in|cur the &s;pectator's
di&s;like, &s;o he does but excite his attention."</Q></P>
<P>Another point of view which men have in <PB N="100" REF="104">
dre&s;&s;ing, is to encrea&s;e the &s;ize of their figure; and to take up more
room in the world than Nature &s;eems to have allotted them. We de&s;ire to
&s;well out our cloaths by the &s;tiffne&s;s of art, and rai&s;e our heels,
while we add to the large|ne&s;s of our heads. How bulky &s;oever our dre&s;s
may be, our vanities are &s;till more bulky. The largene&s;s of the doctor's
wig ari&s;es from the &s;ame pride with the &s;mallne&s;s of the beau's queue.
Both want to have the &s;ize of their un|der&s;tanding mea&s;ured by the &s;ize
of their heads.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome modes that &s;eem to have a more rea&s;onable
origin, which is to hide or to le&s;&s;en the defects of Nature. To take men
al|together, there are many more deformed and plain, than beautiful and
&s;hapely. The former, as being the mo&s;t numerous, give law to fa&s;hion; and
their laws are generally &s;uch as are made in their own favour. The women
begin to colour their cheeks with red, when the na|tural ro&s;es are faded; and
the younger are obliged to &s;ubmit, though not compelled by the &s;ame
nece&s;&s;ity. In all parts of the world, this cu&s;tom prevails more or
le&s;s; and powdering and frizzing the hair, though not &s;o general, &s;eems
to have ari&s;en from a &s;imilar control.</P>
<P>But leaving the draperies of the human <PB N="101" REF="105">
picture, let us return to the figure, unadorned by art. Man's head, whether
con&s;idered exter|nally or internally, is differently formed from that of all
other animals, the monkey-kind only excepted, in which there is a &s;triking
&s;imilitude. There are &s;ome differences, however, which we &s;hall take
notice of in another place. The bodies of all quadrupede animals are covered
with hair; but the head of man &s;eems the part mo&s;t adorned; and that more
abundantly than in any other animal.</P>
<P>There is a very great variety in the teeth of all animals; &s;ome
have them above and below; others have them in the under jaw only: in &s;ome
they &s;tand &s;eparate from each other; while in &s;ome they are continued and
united. The palate of &s;ome fi&s;hes is nothing el&s;e but a bony plate
&s;tudded with points, which perform the offices of teeth. All the&s;e
&s;ub&s;tances, in every animal, derive their origin from the nerves; the
&s;ub&s;tance of the nerves hardens by being expo&s;ed to the air; and the
nerves that terminate in the mouth, being thus expo&s;ed, acquire a bony
&s;olidity. In this manner, the teeth and nails are formed in man; and in this
manner al&s;o, the beak, the hoofs, the horns, and the talons of other
ani|mals, are found to be produced.</P>
<P>The neck &s;upports the head, and unites it to <PB N="102" REF="106"> the body. This part is much more con&s;iderable in the generality of
quadrupedes, than in man. But fi&s;hes, and other animals that want lungs
&s;imilar to ours, have no neck what&s;oever. Birds, in general, have the neck
longer than any other kind of animals: tho&s;e of them, which have &s;hort
claws, have al&s;o &s;hort necks; tho&s;e, on the contrary, that have them
long, are found to have the neck in proportion. 
<Q REND="inline">"In men, there is a lump upon the wind-pipe, formed
by the thuroid cartilage, which is not to be &s;een in women; an Arabian fable
&s;ays, that this is a part of the original apple, that has &s;tuck in the
man's throat by the way, but that the woman &s;wallowed her part of it
down."</Q></P>
<P>The human brea&s;t is outwardly formed in a very different manner
from that of other ani|mals. It is larger in proportion to the &s;ize of the
body; and none but man, and &s;uch ani|mals as make u&s;e of their fore feet as
hands, &s;uch as monkies, bats, and &s;quirrels, are found to have tho&s;e
bones called the clavicles, or, as we u&s;ually term them, the
collar-bones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon &s;ays, that none but monkeys
have them: but this is an over&s;ight.</NOTE>. The brea&s;ts in women are
larger than in men; how|ever, they &s;eem formed in the &s;ame manner; and,
&s;ometimes, milk is found in the brea&s;ts of <PB N="103" REF="107"> men, as
well as in tho&s;e of women. Among ani|mals, there is a great variety in this
part of the body. The teats of &s;ome, as in the ape and the elephant, are like
tho&s;e of men, being but two, and placed on each &s;ide of the brea&s;t. The
teats of the bear amount to four. The &s;heep has but two, placed between the
hinder legs. Other animals, &s;uch as the bitch, and the &s;ow, have them all
along the belly; and, as they produce many young, they have a great many teats
for their &s;upport. The form al&s;o of the teats, varies in different animals;
and, in the &s;ame animal, at different ages. The bo&s;om in females, &s;eems
to unite all our ideas of beauty, where the outline is continually changing,
and the gra|dations are &s;oft and regular.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The graceful fall of the &s;houlders, both in man
and woman, con&s;titute no &s;mall part of beauty. In apes, though otherwi&s;e
made like us, the &s;houlders are high, and drawn up on each &s;ide towards the
ears. In man they fall by a gentle declivity; and the more &s;o, in pro|portion
to the beauty of his form. In fact, being high &s;houldered, is not without
rea&s;on con&s;idered as a deformity, for we find very &s;ickly per&s;ons are
always &s;o; and people, when dying, are ever &s;een with their &s;houlders
drawn up in a &s;urprizing manner. The mu&s;cles that <PB N="104" REF="108">
&s;erve to rai&s;e the ribs, mo&s;tly ri&s;e near the &s;houlders; and the
higher we rai&s;e the &s;houl|ders, we the more ea&s;ily rai&s;e the ribs
likewi&s;e. It happens, therefore, in the &s;ickly, and the dying, who do not
breathe without labour, that to rai&s;e the ribs, they are obliged to call in
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;houlders; and thus their bodies a&s;&s;ume, from
habit, that form which they are &s;o fre|quently obliged to a&s;&s;ume. Women
with child al&s;o, are u&s;ually &s;een to be high &s;houldered; for the weight
of the inferior parts drawing down the ribs, they are obliged to u&s;e every
effort to elevate them, and thus they rai&s;e the &s;houlders of cour&s;e.
During pregnancy al&s;o, the &s;hape, not only of the &s;houlders, but al&s;o
of the brea&s;t, and even the features of the face, are greatly altered: for
the whole upper fore-part of the body is covered with a broad thin &s;kin,
called the myoides; which being, at that time, drawn down, it draws down with
it the &s;kin, and, con&s;equently, the features of the face. By this means,
the vi&s;age takes a particular form; the lower eye-lids, and the corners of
the mouth, are drawn downwards; &s;o that the eyes are enlarged, and the mouth
lengthened: and women, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, are &s;aid, by the midwives,
to be all mouth and eyes."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="109">The arms of men but very little re&s;emble the
fore feet of quadrupedes, and much le&s;s the wings of birds. The ape is the
only animal that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hands and arms; but the&s;e are much
more rudely fa&s;hioned, and with le&s;s exact proportion than in men; 
<Q REND="inline">"the thumb not being &s;o well oppo&s;ed to the
re&s;t of the fingers, in their hands, as in ours."</Q></P>
<P>The form of the back is not much different in man from that of other
quadrupede animals, only that the reins are more mu&s;cular in him, and
&s;tronger. The buttock, however, in man, is different from that of all other
animals what|&s;oever. What goes by that name, in other creatures, is only the
upper part of the thigh: man being the only animal that &s;upports him|&s;elf
perfectly erect, the peculiar largene&s;s of this part is owing to the
peculiarity of his po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Man's feet al&s;o are different from tho&s;e of all other animals,
tho&s;e even of apes not excepted. The foot of the ape is rather a kind of
aukward hand; its toes, or rather fingers, are long, and that of the middle
longe&s;t of all. This foot al&s;o wants the heel, as in man; the &s;ole al&s;o
is nar|rower, and le&s;s adapted to maintain the equi|librium of the body in
walking, dancing, or running.</P>
<P>The nails are le&s;s in man than in any other <PB N="106" REF="110">
animal. If they were much longer than the extremities of the fingers, they
would rather be prejudicial than &s;erviceable, and ob&s;truct the management
of the hand. Such &s;avages as let them grow long make u&s;e of them in fleaing
animals, in tearing their fle&s;h, and &s;uch like purpo&s;es; however, though
their nails are con|&s;iderably larger than ours, they are by no means to be
compared to the hoofs, or the claws of other animals. 
<Q REND="inline">"They may &s;ometimes be &s;een longer, indeed, than
the claws of any animal what&s;oever; as we learn that the nails of &s;ome of
the learned men in China are longer than their fingers. But the&s;e want that
&s;olidity which might give force to their exertions; and could never, in a
&s;tate of nature, have &s;erved them for annoyance, or defence."</Q></P>
<P>There is little known exactly with regard to the proportion of the
human figure; and the beauty of the be&s;t &s;tatues is better conceived by
ob&s;erv|ing than by mea&s;uring them. The &s;tatues of antiquity, which were
at fir&s;t copied after the human form, are now become the models of it; nor is
there one man found who&s;e per&s;on any way approaches to tho&s;e inimitable
perform|ances that have thus, in one figure, united the perfections of many. It
is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that, from being at fir&s;t models, they are now
become <PB N="107" REF="111"> orginals; and are u&s;ed to correct the
deviations in that form from whence they were taken." I will not, however,
pretend to give the pro|portions of the human body as taken from the&s;e, there
being nothing more arbitrary, and which good painters them&s;elves &s;o much
contemn. Some, for in&s;tance, who have &s;tudied after the&s;e, divide the
body into ten times the length of the face, and others into eight. Some pretend
to tell us that there is a &s;imilitude of proportion in dif|ferent parts of
the body. Thus, that the hand is the length of the face; the thumb the length
of the no&s;e; the &s;pace between the eyes is the breadth of an eye; that the
breadth of the thigh, at thicke&s;t, is double that of the thicke&s;t part of
the leg, and treble the &s;malle&s;t; that the arms extended are ju&s;t as long
as the figure is high; that the legs and thighs are ju&s;t half the length of
the figure. All this, however, is extremely arbitrary; and the excellence of a
&s;hape, or the beauty of a &s;tatue, re&s;ults from the attitude and
po&s;ition of the whole, rather than any e&s;tabli&s;hed mea&s;urements, begun
without experience, and adopted by caprice. In general, it may be remarked that
the pro|portions alter in every age, and are obviou&s;ly different in the two
&s;exes. In woman, the &s;houl|ders are narrower, and the neck proportionably 
<PB N="108" REF="112"> longer than in men. The hips al&s;o are con|&s;iderably
larger, and the thighs much &s;horter than in men. The&s;e proportions,
however, vary greatly at different ages. In infancy the upper parts of the body
are much larger than the lower; the legs and thighs do not con&s;titute any
thing like half the height of the whole figure; in proportion as the child
encrea&s;es in age, the inferior parts are found to lengthen; &s;o that the
body is not equally divided until it has acquired its full growth.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of men varies con&s;iderably. Men are &s;aid to be tall
who are from five feet eight inches to &s;ix feet high. The middle &s;tature is
from five feet five to five feet eight: and the&s;e are &s;aid to be of &s;mall
&s;tature who fall under the&s;e mea&s;ures. 
<Q REND="inline">"However, it ought to be re|marked, that the &s;ame
per&s;on is always taller when he ri&s;es in the morning, than upon going to
bed at night; and &s;ometimes there is an inch difference; and I have &s;een
more. Few per&s;ons are &s;en&s;ible of this remarkable variation; and, I am
told, it was fir&s;t perceived, in England, by a recruiting officer. He often
found that that tho&s;e men whom he had enli&s;ted for &s;ol|diers, and
an&s;wered to the appointed &s;tandard at one time, fell &s;hort of it when
they came to be mea&s;ured before the colonel, at the head 
<PB N="109" REF="113"> quarters. This dimunition in their &s;ize pro|ceeded
from the different times of the day, and the different &s;tates of the body
when they hap|pened to be mea&s;ured. If, as was &s;aid, they were mea&s;ured
in the morning, after the night's refre&s;hment, they were found to be commonly
half an inch, and very often a whole inch taller than in mea&s;ured after the
fatigues of the day; if they were mea&s;ured when fre&s;h, in the country, and
before a long fatiguing march to the regiment, they were found to be an inch
taller than when they arrived at their journey's end. All this is now well
known among tho&s;e who recruit for the army; and the rea&s;on of this
difference of &s;tature is obvious. Between all the joints of the back-bone,
which is compo&s;ed of &s;everal pieces, there is a glutinous liquor
depo&s;ited, which &s;erves, like oil in a machine, to give the parts an ea&s;y
play upon each other. This lubricating liquor, or &s;ynovia, as the
ana|tomi&s;ts call it, is poured in during the &s;ea&s;on of repo&s;e, and is
con&s;umed by exerci&s;e and em|ployment; &s;o that in a body, after hard
labour, there is &s;carce any of it remaining; but all the joints grow &s;tiff,
and their motion becomes hard and painful. It is from hence, therefore, that
the body dimini&s;hes in &s;tature. For this moi|&s;ture being drained away,
from between the nu|merous <PB N="110" REF="114"> joints of the back-bone, they
lie clo&s;er upon each other; and their whole length is thus very &s;en&s;ibly
dimini&s;hed; but &s;leep once more, by re&s;toring the fluid, again &s;wells
the &s;paces between the joints, and the whole is extended to its former
dimen&s;ions. 
<P>"As the human body is thus often found to differ from it&s;elf
in &s;ize, &s;o it is found to differ in its weight al&s;o; and the &s;ame
per&s;on, with|out any apparent cau&s;e, is found to be heavier at one time
than another. If, after having eaten an hearty dinner, or having drank hard,
the per&s;on &s;hould find him&s;elf thus heavier, it would appear no way
extraordinary; but the fact is, the body is very often found heavier &s;ome
hours after eating an hearty meal, than immediately &s;ucceeding it. If, for
in&s;tance, a per&s;on, fatigued by a day's hard labour, &s;hould eat a
plentiful &s;upper, and then get him&s;elf weighed upon going to bed; after
&s;leeping &s;oundly, if he is again weighed, he will find him&s;elf
con&s;iderably heavier than before; and this difference is often found to
amount to a pound, or &s;ometimes to a pound and a half. From whence this
adventitious weight is derived is not ea&s;y to conceive; the body, during the
whole night, appears rather plentifully per&s;piring than imbibing any fluid,
ra|ther <PB N="111" REF="115"> lo&s;ing than gaining moi&s;ture: however, we
have no rea&s;on to doubt but that either by the lungs, or, perhaps, by a
peculiar &s;et of pores, it is all this time inhaling a quantity of fluid,
which thus encrea&s;es the weight of the whole body, upon being weighed the
next morning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this experiment al&s;o, the learned
may gather upon what a weak foundation the whole doctrine of Sanc|torian
per&s;piration is built: but this di&s;qui&s;ition more properly belongs to
medicine than natural hi&s;tory.</NOTE>."</P></Q></P>
<P>Although the human body is externally more delicate than any in of
the quadrupede kind, it is, notwith&s;tanding, extremely mu&s;cular: and,
per|haps, for its &s;ize, &s;tronger than that of any other animal
what&s;oever. If we &s;hould offer to com|pare the &s;trength of the lion with
that of man, we &s;hould con&s;ider that the claws of this animal give us a
fal&s;e idea of its power; we a&s;cribe to its force what is only the effects
of its arms. Tho&s;e which man has received from Nature are not offen&s;ive;
happy had art never furni&s;hed him with any more terrible than tho&s;e which
arm the paws of the lion.</P>
<P>But there is another manner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr.
Buffon calls it a better manner, but this is not the ca&s;e.</NOTE> of
comparing the &s;trength of man with that of other animals; namely, by the
weights which either can carry. <PB N="112" REF="116"> We are a&s;&s;ured that
the porters of Con&s;tanti|nople, carry burthens of nine hundred pounds weight:
Mr. De&s;aguliers tells us of a man, who, by di&s;tributing weights in &s;uch a
manner as that every part of his body bore its &s;hare, he was thus able to
rai&s;e a weight of two thou&s;and pounds. An hor&s;e, which is about &s;even
times our bulk, would be thus able to rai&s;e a weight of fourteen thou&s;and
pounds, if its &s;trength were in the &s;ame proportion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon carries this &s;ubject no farther; and thus far,
without explanation, it is erroneous.</NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"But, the truth is, an hor&s;e will not carry upon
its back, above a weight of two or three hundred pounds; while a man, of
confe&s;&s;edly inferior &s;trength, is thus able to &s;upport two thou&s;and.
Whence comes this &s;eeming &s;uperiority? The an&s;wer is obvious. Becau&s;e
the load upon man's &s;houl|ders is placed to the greate&s;t advantage; while,
upon the hor&s;e's back, it is placed at the greate&s;t di&s;advantage. Let us
&s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, the man &s;tanding as upright as po&s;&s;ible, under
the great load abovementioned. It is obvious that all the bones of his body may
be compared to a pillar &s;upporting a building, and that his mu&s;cles have
&s;carce any &s;hare in this dangerous duty. However, they are not entirely
inactive; as man, let him &s;tand never &s;o upright, will 
<PB N="113" REF="117"> have &s;ome bending in the different parts of his body.
The mu&s;cles, therefore, give the bones &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that with
the greate&s;t po&s;|&s;ible advantage. In this manner, therefore, a man has
been found to &s;upport two thou&s;and weight; but may be capable of
&s;upporting a &s;till greater. The manner in which this is done, is by
&s;trapping the load round the &s;houlders of the per&s;on, who is to bear it
by a machine, &s;omething like that by which milk ve&s;&s;els, or water-buckets
are carried. The load being thus placed on a &s;caffold, on each &s;ide,
con|trived for that purpo&s;e, and the man &s;tanding erect in the mid&s;t, all
parts of the &s;caffold, ex|cept that where the man &s;tands, are made to
&s;ink; and thus the man maintaining his po&s;i|tion, the load, whatever it is,
becomes &s;u&s;|pended, and the column of his bones may be fairly &s;aid to
&s;upport it. If, however, he &s;hould but ever &s;o little give way, he mu&s;t
inevitably drop; and no power of his can rai&s;e the weights again. But the
ca&s;e is very different with re|gard to a load laid upon an hor&s;e. The
co|lumn of the bones there lies a different way; and a weight of five hundred
pounds, as I am told, would break the back of the &s;tronge&s;t hor&s;e that
could be found. The great force of an hor&s;e, and other quadrupedes, is
exerted <PB N="114" REF="118"> when the load is in &s;uch a po&s;ition as that
the column of the bones can be properly applied; which is lengthwi&s;e. When,
therefore, we are to e&s;timate the comparative &s;trength of an hor&s;e, we
are not to try what he can carry, but what he can draw; and, in this ca&s;e,
his amaz|ing &s;uperiority over man is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned; for one hor&s;e
can draw a load that ten men cannot move. And in &s;ome ca&s;es it happens that
a draft hor&s;e draws the better for being &s;omewhat loaded; for, as the
pea&s;ants &s;ay, the load upon his back keeps him the better to the
ground."</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;till another way of e&s;timating hu|man &s;trength by
the per&s;everance and agility of our motions. Men, who are exerci&s;ed in
run|ning, out&s;trip hor&s;es; or at lea&s;t hold their &s;peed for a longer
continuance. In a journey, al&s;o, a man will walk down a hor&s;e; and, after
they have both continued to proceed for &s;everal days, the hor&s;e will be
quite tired, and the man will be fre&s;her than in the beginning. The king's
me&s;&s;engers of I&s;pahan, who are runners by profe&s;&s;ion, go thirty-&s;ix
leagues in fourteen hours. Travellers a&s;&s;ure us that the Hotten|tots
out&s;trip lions in the chace; and that the &s;avages, who hunt the elk,
pur&s;ue with &s;uch &s;peed, that they at la&s;t tire down, and take it. 
<PB N="115" REF="119"> We are told many very &s;urprizing things of the great
&s;wiftne&s;s of the &s;avages, and of the long journeys they undertake, on
foot, through the mo&s;t craggy mountains, where there are no paths to direct,
nor hou&s;es to entertain them. They are &s;aid to perform a journey of twelve
hundred leagues in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. 
<Q REND="inline">"But, notwith&s;tanding what travellers report of
this matter, I have been a&s;&s;ured, from many of our officers, and
&s;oldiers, who compared their own &s;wiftne&s;s with that of the native
Americans, during the la&s;t war, that although the &s;avages held out and, as
the phra&s;e is, had better bot|tom, yet, for a &s;purt, the Engli&s;hmen were
more nimble and &s;peedy."</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in general, civilized man is ignorant of his own
powers; he is ignorant how much he lo&s;es by effeminacy; and what might be
acquired by habit and exerci&s;e. Here and there, indeed, men are found among
us of extraordinary &s;trength; but that &s;trength, for want of opportunity,
is &s;eldom called into exer|tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"Among the ancients it was a quality of much greater
u&s;e than at pre&s;ent; as in war the &s;ame man that had &s;trength
&s;ufficient to carry the heavie&s;t armour, had &s;trength &s;uffi|cient
al&s;o to &s;trike the mo&s;t fatal blow. In this ca&s;e, his &s;trength was at
once his protection <PB N="116" REF="120"> and his power. We ought not to be
&s;urprized, therefore, when we hear of one man terrible to an army, and
irre&s;i&s;tible in his career, as we find &s;ome generals repre&s;ented in
ancient hi|&s;tory. But we may be very certain that this prowe&s;s was
exaggerated by flattery, and exalted by terror. An age of ignorance is ever an
age of wonder. At &s;uch times, mankind, having no ju&s;t ideas of the human
powers, are willing rather to repre&s;ent what they wi&s;h than what they know;
and exalt human &s;trength, to fill up the whole &s;phere of their limited
conceptions. Great &s;trength is an accidental thing; two, or three, in a
country, may po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and the&s;e may have a claim to heroi&s;m. But
what may lead us to doubt of the veracity of the&s;e accounts is, that the
heroes of antiquity are repre&s;ented as the &s;ons of heroes; their amazing
&s;trength is delivered down from father to &s;on; and this we know to be
contrary to the cour&s;e of nature. Strength is not hereditary; although titles
are: and I am very much induced to believe, that this great tribe of heroes,
who are all repre&s;ented as the de|&s;cendants of heroes, are more obliged to
their titles than to their &s;trength, for their characters. With regard to the
&s;hining characters in Ho|mer, they are all repre&s;ented as princes, and as
the &s;ons of princes; while we are told of <PB N="117" REF="121"> &s;carce any
&s;hare of prowe&s;s what&s;oever in the meaner men of the army; who are only
brought into the field for the&s;e to protect, or to &s;laughter. But nothing
can be more unlikely than that tho&s;e men, who were bred in the luxury of
courts, &s;hould be &s;trong; while the whole body of the people, who received
a plainer and &s;impler edu|cation, &s;hould be comparatively weak. Nothing can
be more contrary to the general laws of nature, than that all the &s;ons of
heroes &s;hould thus inherit not only the kingdoms, but the &s;trength of their
forefathers; and we may conclude, that they owe the greate&s;t &s;hare of their
imputed &s;trength rather to the dignity of their &s;tations than the force of
their arms; and, like all fortunate princes, their flatterers happened to be
believed. In later ages, indeed, we have &s;ome accounts of amazing &s;trength,
which we can have no rea&s;on to doubt of. But in the&s;e, nature is found to
pur&s;ue her ordi|nary cour&s;e; and we find their &s;trength acci|dental. We
find the&s;e &s;trong men among the lowe&s;t of the people, and gradually
ri&s;ing into notice, as this &s;uperiority had more opportunity of being
&s;een. Of this number was the Roman tribune, who went by the name of the
&s;econd Achilles; who, with his own hand, killed, at different times, three
hundred of the enemy; <PB N="118" REF="122"> and when treacherou&s;ly &s;et
upon, by twenty-five of his own countrymen, although then pa&s;t his &s;ixtieth
year, killed fourteen of them before he was &s;lain. Of this number was Milo,
who, when he &s;tood upright, could not be forced out of his place. Pliny,
al&s;o, tells us of one Athanatus, who walked acro&s;s the &s;tage at Rome,
loaded with a brea&s;t plate weigh|ing five hundred pounds, and bu&s;kins of
the &s;ame weight. But of all the prodigies of &s;trength, of whom we have any
accounts in Roman hi&s;tory, Maximin, the emperor, is to be reckoned the
foremo&s;t. Whatever we are told relative to him is well atte&s;ted; his
cha|racter was too exalted not to be thoroughly known; and that very
&s;trength, for which he was celebrated, at la&s;t procured him no le&s;s a
re|ward than the empire of the world. Maximin was above nine feet in height,
and the be&s;t pro|portioned man in the whole empire. He was by birth a
Thracian; and, from being a &s;imple herd&s;man, ro&s;e through the gradations
of of|fice, until he came to be Emperor of Rome. The fir&s;t opportunity he had
of exerting his &s;trength, was in the pre&s;ence of all the citizens, in the
theatre, where he overthrew twelve of the &s;tronge&s;t men, in wre&s;tling,
and out&s;tript two of the fleete&s;t hor&s;es, in running, all in 
<PB N="119" REF="123"> one day. He could draw a chariot loaden, that two
&s;trong hor&s;es could not move; he could break a hor&s;e's jaw with a blow of
his fi&s;t; and its thigh with a kick. In war he was always foremo&s;t, and
invincible; happy had it been for him, and his &s;ubjects, if, from being
formi|dable to his enemies, he had not become &s;till more &s;o to his
&s;ubjects; he reigned, for &s;ome time, with all the world his enemy; all
mankind wi&s;hing him dead, yet none daring to &s;trike the blow. As if fortune
had re&s;olved that through life he &s;hould continue unconquerable, he was
killed at la&s;t by his own &s;oldiers, while he was &s;leeping. We have many
other in&s;tances, in later ages, of very great &s;trength, and not fewer of
amazing &s;wiftne&s;s; but the&s;e, merely corporeal perfections, are now
con&s;idered as of &s;mall ad|vantage, either in war or in peace. The
in|vention of gunpowder has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, levelled down all force to
one &s;tandard; and has wrought a total change in human edu|cation through all
parts of the world. In peace al&s;o, the invention of new machines every day,
and the application of the &s;trength of the lower animals to the purpo&s;es of
life, have rendered human &s;trength le&s;s valuable. The boa&s;t of corporeal
force is now, therefore, con&s;igned to &s;avage nations, where tho&s;e arts 
<PB N="120" REF="124"> not being introduced, it may &s;till be need|ful; but,
in more polite countries, few will be proud of that &s;trength which other
animals can be taught to exert to as u&s;eful purpo&s;es as they. 
<P>"If we compare the largene&s;s and thickne&s;s of our mu&s;cles
with tho&s;e of any other animal, we &s;hall find that, in this re&s;pect, we
have the advantage; and if &s;trength, or &s;wiftne&s;s, de|pended upon the
quantity of mu&s;cular fle&s;h alone, I believe that, in this re&s;pect, we
&s;hould be more active and powerful than any other. But this is not the
ca&s;e; a great deal more than the &s;ize of the mu&s;cles goes to con&s;titute
ac|tivity, or force; and it is not he who has the thicke&s;t legs that can make
the be&s;t u&s;e of them. Tho&s;e, therefore, who have written elaborate
treati&s;es on mu&s;cular force, and have e&s;timated the &s;trength of animals
by the thick|ne&s;s of their mu&s;cles, have been employed to very little
purpo&s;e. It is, in general, ob&s;erved that thin and raw-boned men are always
&s;tronger and more powerful than &s;uch as are &s;eemingly more mu&s;cular; as
in the former all the parts have better room for their exertions."</P></Q></P>
<P>Women want much of the &s;trength of men; and, in &s;ome countries,
the &s;tronger &s;ex have availed them&s;elves of this &s;uperiority, in
cruelly <PB N="121" REF="125"> and tyranically en&s;laving tho&s;e who were
made with equal preten&s;ions to a &s;hare in all the ad|vantages life can
be&s;tow. Savage nations oblige their women to a life of continual labour; upon
them re&s;ts all the drudgeries of dome&s;tic duty; while the hu&s;band,
indolently reclined in his hammock, is fir&s;t &s;erved from the fruits of her
indu&s;try. From this negligent &s;ituation he is &s;eldom rouzed, except by
the calls of appetite, when it is nece&s;&s;ary, either by fi&s;hing or
hunt|ing, to make a variety in his entertainments. A &s;avage has no idea of
taking plea&s;ure in ex|erci&s;e; he is &s;urprized to &s;ee an European walk
forward for his amu&s;ement, and then return back again. As for his part he
could be con|tented to remain for ever in the &s;ame &s;ituation, perfectly
&s;atisfied with &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures and undi&s;turbed repo&s;e. The women,
therefore, of the&s;e countries, are the greate&s;t &s;laves upon earth;
&s;en&s;ible of their weakne&s;s, and unable to re&s;i&s;t, they are obliged to
&s;uffer tho&s;e hard|&s;hips which are naturally inflicted by &s;uch as have
been taught that nothing but corporeal force ought to give pre-eminence. It is
not, therefore, till after &s;ome degree of refinement, that women are treated
with lenity; and not till the highe&s;t degree of politene&s;s, that they are 
<PB N="122" REF="126"> permitted to &s;hare in all the privileges of man. The
fir&s;t impul&s;e of &s;avage nature is to confirm their &s;lavery; the next,
of half barbarous na|tions, is to appropriate their beauty; and that, of the
perfectly polite, to engage their affec|tions. In civilized countries,
therefore, women have united the force of mode&s;ty to the power of their
natural charms; and thus obtain that &s;uperiority over the mind, which they
are unable to extort by their &s;trength.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Sleep and Hunger.</HEAD>
<P>AS man, in all the privileges he enjoys, and the powers he is
inve&s;ted with, has a &s;uperiority over all other animals, &s;o, in his
nece&s;&s;ities, he &s;eems inferior to the meane&s;t of them all. Nature has
brought him into life with a greater variety of wants and infirmities, than the
re&s;t of her creatures, unarmed in the mid&s;t of ene|mies. The lion has
natural arms; the bear natural cloathing; but man is de&s;titute of all &s;uch
advantages; and, from the &s;uperiority of his mind alone, he is to &s;upply
the deficiency. The number of his wants, however, were merely given, in order
to multiply the number of his enjoyments; &s;ince the po&s;&s;ibility of being
de|prived of any good, teaches him the value of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Were
man born with tho&s;e ad|vantages which he learns to po&s;&s;e&s;s by
indu&s;try, he would very probably enjoy them with a blunter reli&s;h: it is by
being naked, that he knows the value of a covering; it is by being expo&s;ed to
the weather, that he learns the com|forts of an habitation. Every want thus
be|comes a means of plea&s;ure, in the redre&s;&s;ing; and that animal that has
mo&s;t de&s;ires, may be <PB N="124" REF="128"> &s;aid to be capable of the
greate&s;t variety of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the thou&s;and imaginary wants peculiar to man only, there
are two, which he has in common with all other animals; and which he feels in a
more nece&s;&s;ary manner than they. The&s;e are the wants of &s;leep and
hunger. Every animal that we are acquainted with, &s;eems to endure the want of
the&s;e with much le&s;s injury to health, than man; and &s;ome are mo&s;t
&s;ur|prizingly patient in &s;u&s;taining both. The little dome&s;tic animals
that we keep about us, may often &s;et a le&s;&s;on of calm re&s;ignation, in
&s;up|porting want and watchfulne&s;s, to the boa&s;ted philo&s;opher. They
receive their pittance at uncertain intervals, and wait its coming with
chearful expectation. We have in&s;tances of the dog, and the cat, living, in
this manner, without food, for &s;everal days; and yet &s;till pre&s;erving
their attachment to the tyrant that oppre&s;&s;es them; &s;till ready to exert
their little &s;ervices for his amu&s;ement or defence. But the patience of
the&s;e is nothing, to what the animals of the fore&s;t endure. As the&s;e
mo&s;tly live upon ac|cidental carnage, &s;o they are often known to remain
without food for &s;everal weeks together. Nature, kindly &s;olicitous for
their &s;upport, has al&s;o contracted their &s;tomachs, to &s;uit them for 
<PB N="125" REF="129"> their precarious way of living; and kindly, while it
abridges the banquet, le&s;&s;ens the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of providing for it. But
the meaner tribes of animals are made &s;till more capable of &s;u&s;taining
life without food, many of them re|maining in a &s;tate of torpid indifference
till their prey approaches, when they jump upon and &s;eize it. In this manner,
the &s;nake, or the &s;pider, continue, for &s;everal months together, to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t upon a &s;ingle meal; and &s;ome of the butterfly kinds actually
live upon nothing. But it is very different with man: his wants daily make
their importunate demands; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that he cannot continue to
live four days without eating, drinking, and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>Hunger is a much more powerful enemy to man than watchfulne&s;s, and
kills him much &s;ooner. It may be con&s;idered as a di&s;order that food
removes; and that would quickly be fatal, without its proper antidote. In fact,
it is &s;o terrible to man, that to avoid it he even en|counters certain death;
and, rather than endure its tortures, exchanges them for immediate
de&s;truction. However, by what I have been told, it is much more dreadful in
its approaches, than in its continuance; and the pains of a fa|mi&s;hing
wretch, decrea&s;e as his &s;trength di|mini&s;hes. In the beginning, the
de&s;ire of food <PB N="126" REF="130"> is dreadful indeed, as we know by
experience, for there are few who have not in &s;ome degree felt its
approaches. But, after the fir&s;t or &s;econd day, its tortures become le&s;s
terrible, and a total in&s;en&s;ibility at length comes kindly in to the poor
wretch's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have talked with the captain of a &s;hip, who was
one of &s;ix that endured it in its extremities; and who was the only per&s;on
that had not lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, when they received accidental relief. He
a&s;|&s;ured me, his pains at fir&s;t were &s;o great, as to be often tempted
to eat a part of one of the men who died; and which the re&s;t of his crew
actually for &s;ome time lived upon: he &s;aid that, during the continuance of
this paroxy&s;m, he found his pains in&s;upportable; and was de&s;irous, at one
time, of anticipating that death which he thought inevitable: but his pains, he
&s;aid, gra|dually decrea&s;ed, after the &s;ixth day, (for they had water in
the &s;hip, which kept them alive &s;o long) and then he was in a &s;tate
rather of lan|guor than de&s;ire; nor did he much wi&s;h for food, except when
he &s;aw others eating; and that for a while revived his appetite, though with
dimini&s;hed importunity. The latter part of the time, when his health was
almo&s;t de&s;troy|ed, a thou&s;and &s;trange images ro&s;e upon his mind; and
every one of his &s;en&s;es began to <PB N="127" REF="131"> bring him wrong
information. The mo&s;t fra|grant perfumes appeared to him to have a foetid
&s;mell; and every thing he looked at, took a greeni&s;h hue, and &s;ometimes a
yellow. When he was pre&s;ented with food by the &s;hip's com|pany that took
him and his men up, four of whom died &s;hortly after, he could not help
looking upon it with loathing, in&s;tead of de&s;ire; and it was not till after
four days, that his &s;to|mach was brought to its natural tone; when the
violence of his appetite returned, with a &s;ort of canine eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus dreadful are the effects of hunger; and yet when we come to
a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e that pro|duces them, we find the &s;ubject involved in
doubt and intricacy. This longing eagerne&s;s is, no doubt, given for a very
obvious pur|po&s;e; that of repleni&s;hing the body, wa&s;ted by fatigue and
per&s;piration. Were not men &s;ti|mulated by &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing monitor,
they might be apt to pur&s;ue other amu&s;ements, with a per|&s;everance beyond
their power; and forget the u&s;eful hours of refre&s;hment, in tho&s;e more
tempting ones of plea&s;ure. But hunger makes a demand that will not be
refu&s;ed; and, indeed, the generality of mankind, &s;eldom await the call.</P>
<P>Hunger has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to ari&s;e 
<PB N="128" REF="132"> from the rubbing of the coats of the &s;tomach again&s;t
each other, without having any inter|vening &s;ub&s;tance to prevent their
painful at|trition. Others have imagined, that its juices, wanting their
nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply, turn acrid, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, pungent; and thus fret
its internal coats, &s;o as to produce a train of the mo&s;t un|ea&s;y
&s;en&s;ations. Boerhaave, who made his re|putation in phy&s;ic, by uniting the
conjectures of all tho&s;e that preceded him, a&s;cribes hunger to the united
effect of both the&s;e cau&s;es; and a&s;&s;erts, that the pungency of the
ga&s;tric juices, and the attrition of its coats again&s;t each other, cau&s;e
tho&s;e pains, which nothing but food can remove. The&s;e juices continuing
&s;till to be &s;eparated in the &s;tomach, and every moment becoming more
acrid, mix with the blood, and infect the circulation: the circulation being
thus contaminated, becomes weaker, and more con|tracted; and the whole nervous
frame &s;ympa|thizing, an hectic fever, and &s;ometimes madne&s;s, is produced;
in which &s;tate the faint wretch ex|pires. In this manner, the man who dies of
hunger, may be &s;aid to be poi&s;oned by the juices of his own body; and is
de&s;troyed le&s;s by the want of nouri&s;hment, than by the vitiated qualities
of that which he had already taken.</P>
<P>However this may be, we have but few in|&s;tances 
<PB N="129" REF="133"> of men dying, except at &s;ea, of ab&s;olute hunger. The
decline of tho&s;e unhappy creatures who are de&s;titute of food, at land,
being more &s;low and unperceived. The&s;e, from often being in need, and as
often receiving an accidental &s;upply, pa&s;s their lives between &s;urfeiting
and repining; and their con&s;titution is impaired by in&s;en&s;ible degrees.
Man is unfit for a &s;tate of precarious expectation. That &s;hare of provident
precaution which incites him to lay up &s;tores for a di&s;tant day, becomes
his torment, when totally unprovided again&s;t an immediate call. The lower
race of animals, when &s;atisfied, for the in&s;tant moment, are perfectly
happy: but it is otherwi&s;e with man; his mind anticipates di|&s;tre&s;s, and
feels the pangs of want even before it arre&s;ts him. Thus the mind, being
con|tinually harra&s;&s;ed by the &s;ituation, it at length influences the
con&s;titution, and unfits it for all its functions. Some cruel di&s;order, but
no way like hunger, &s;eizes the unhappy &s;ufferer; &s;o that almo&s;t all
tho&s;e men who have thus long lived by chance, and who&s;e every day may be
con&s;idered as an happy e&s;cape from famine, are known at la&s;t to die in
reality, of a di&s;|order cau&s;ed by hunger; but which, in the common
language, is often called a broken-heart. Some of the&s;e I have known
my|&s;elf, <PB N="130" REF="134"> when very little able to relieve them: and I
have been told, by a very active and worthy magi&s;trate, that the number of
&s;uch as die in London for want, is much greater than one would
imagine&mdash;I think he talked of two thou&s;and in a year.</P>
<P>But how numerous &s;oever tho&s;e who die of hunger may be, many
times greater, on the other hand, are the number of tho&s;e who die by
repletion. It is not the province of the pre&s;ent page to &s;peculate, with
the phy&s;ician, upon the danger of &s;urfeits; or, with the morali&s;t, upon
the nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s of gluttony: it will only be proper to ob&s;erve, that
as nothing is &s;o pre|judicial to health as hunger by con&s;traint, &s;o
nothing is more beneficial to the con&s;titution than voluntary ab&s;tinence.
It was not without rea&s;on that religion enjoined this duty; &s;ince it
an&s;wered the double purpo&s;e of re&s;toring the health oppre&s;&s;ed by
luxury, and dimini&s;hed the con&s;umption of provi&s;ions, &s;o that a part
might come to the poor. It &s;hould be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;tature,
therefore, to enforce this Divine precept; and thus, by re&s;training one part
of mankind in the u&s;e of their &s;uper|fluities, to con&s;ult for the benefit
of tho&s;e who want the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The injunctions for
ab&s;tinence are &s;trict over the whole Con|tinent; and were rigorou&s;ly
ob&s;erved, even <PB N="131" REF="135"> among our&s;elves, for a long time
after the Reformation. Queen Elizabeth, by giving her commands, upon this head
the air of a political injunction, le&s;&s;ened, in a great mea&s;ure, and, in
my opinion, very unwi&s;ely, the religious force of the obligation. She
enjoined that her &s;ub|jects &s;hould fa&s;t from fle&s;h on fridays and
&s;a|turdays; but at the &s;ame time declared, that this was not commanded from
motives of re|ligion, as if there were any differences in meats, but merely to
favour the con&s;umption of fi&s;h, and thus to multiply the number of
mariners; and al&s;o to &s;pare the &s;tock of &s;heep, which might be more
beneficial in another way. In this manner the injunction defeated its own
force; and this mo&s;t &s;alutary law became no longer binding, when it was
&s;uppo&s;ed to come purely from man. How far it may be enjoined in the
Scriptures, I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but this may be a&s;&s;erted,
that if the utmo&s;t benefit to the individual, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
advantage to &s;ociety, &s;erve to mark any in&s;ti|tution as of Heaven, this
of ab&s;tinence may be reckoned among the foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Were we to give an hi&s;tory of the various benefits that have
ari&s;en from this command, and how conducive it has been to long life, the
in|&s;tances would fatigue with their multiplicity. <PB N="132" REF="136"> It
is &s;urprizing to what a great age the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians of the Ea&s;t,
who retired from per&s;ecution in the de&s;arts of Arabia, continued to live,
in all the bloom of health, and yet all the rigours of ab&s;temious
di&s;cipline. Their common allowance, as we are told, for four and twenty
hours, was twelve ounces of bread, and nothing but water. On this &s;imple
beverage, St. Anthony is &s;aid to have lived an hundred and five years; James,
the hermit, an hundred and four; Ar&s;enius, tutor to the emperor Ar|cadius, an
hundred and twenty; St. Epiphanius, an hundred and fifteen; Simeon, an hundred
and twelve; and Rombald, an hundred and twenty. In this manner did the&s;e holy
tem|perate men live to an extreme old age, kept chearful by &s;trong hopes, and
healthful by mo|derate labour.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tinence which is thus voluntary, may be much more ea&s;ily
&s;upported than con&s;trained hunger. Man is &s;aid to live without food for
&s;even days; which is the u&s;ual limit a&s;&s;igned him: and, perhaps, in a
&s;tate of con&s;traint, this is the longe&s;t time he can &s;urvive the want
of it. But in ca&s;es of voluntary ab&s;tinence, of &s;ickne&s;s, or
&s;leeping, he has been known to live much longer.</P>
<P>In the records of the Tower, there is an ac|count of a Scotchman,
impri&s;oned for felony, <PB N="133" REF="137"> who, for the &s;pace of &s;ix
weeks, took not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;tenance, being exactly watched during the
whole time; and for this he received the king's pardon.</P>
<P>When the American Indians undertake long journies, and when,
con&s;equently, a &s;tock of provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to &s;upport them the
whole way, would be more than they could carry, in order to obviate this
inconvenience, in&s;tead of carrying the nece&s;&s;ary quantity, they contrive
a method of palliating their hunger, by &s;wallow|ing pills, made of calcined
&s;hells and tobacco. The&s;e pills take away all appetite, by produc|ing a
temporary di&s;order in the &s;tomach; and, no doubt, the frequent repetition
of this wretched expedient, mu&s;t at la&s;t be fatal. By this means, however,
they continue &s;everal days without eating, chearfully bearing &s;uch extremes
of fatigue and watching, as would quickly de&s;troy men bred up in a greater
&s;tate of delicacy. For tho&s;e arts by which we learn to obviate our
ne|ce&s;&s;ities, do not fail to unfit us for their ac|cidental encounter.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, man is le&s;s able to &s;upport hunger
than any other animal; and he is not better qualified to &s;upport a &s;tate of
watchfulne&s;s. Indeed, &s;leep &s;eems much more nece&s;&s;ary to him, than to
any other creature; <PB N="134" REF="138"> as, when awake, he may be &s;aid to
exhau&s;t a greater proportion of the nervous fluid; and, con&s;equently, to
&s;tand in need of an adequate &s;upply. Other animals, when mo&s;t awake, are
but little removed from a &s;tate of &s;lumber; their feeble faculties,
impri&s;oned in matter, and rather exerted by impul&s;e than deliberation,
require &s;leep rather as a ce&s;&s;ation from motion, than from thinking. But
it is otherwi&s;e with man; his ideas, fatigued with their various
excur&s;ions, demand a ce&s;&s;ation, not le&s;s than the body, from toil; and
he is the only creature that &s;eems to require &s;leep from double motives;
not le&s;s for the refre&s;hment of the mental, than of the bodily frame.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome lower animals, indeed, that &s;eem to &s;pend the
greate&s;t part of their lives in &s;leep; but, properly &s;peaking, the
&s;leep of &s;uch may be con&s;idered as a kind of death; and their waking, a
re&s;urrection. Flies, and in&s;ects, are &s;aid to be a&s;leep, at a time that
all the vital motions have cea&s;ed; without re&s;piration, with|out any
circulation of their juices, if cut in pieces, they do not awake, nor does any
fluid ooze out at the wound. The&s;e may be con|&s;idered rather as congealed
than as &s;leeping animals; and their re&s;t, during winter, rather as a
ce&s;&s;ation from life, than a nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ment: 
<PB N="135" REF="139"> but in the higher races of animals, who&s;e blood is not
thus congealed, and thawed by heat, the&s;e all bear the want of &s;leep much
better than man; and &s;ome of them continue a long time without &s;eeming to
take any refre&s;hment from it what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But man is more feeble; he requires its due return; and if it fails
to pay the accu&s;tomed vi&s;it, his whole frame is in a &s;hort time thrown
into di&s;order: his appetite cea&s;es; his &s;pirits are dejected; his pul&s;e
becomes quicker and harder; and his mind, abridged of its &s;lum|bering
vi&s;ions, begins to adopt waking dreams. A thou&s;and &s;trange phantoms
ari&s;e, which come and go without his will: the&s;e, which are tran&s;ient in
the beginning, at la&s;t take firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, which yields
to their dominion, and, after a long &s;truggle, runs into confirmed madne&s;s.
In that horrid &s;tate, the mind may be con&s;idered as a city without walls,
open to every in&s;ult, and paying homage to every invader every idea that then
&s;tarts with any force, becomes a reality; and the rea&s;on, over fatigued
with its former impor|tunities, makes no head again&s;t the tyran|nical
inva&s;ion, but &s;ubmits to it from mere imbecillity.</P>
<P>But it is happy for mankind, that this &s;tate <PB N="136" REF="140"> of inquietude is &s;eldom driven to an extreme; and that there are
medicines, which &s;eldom fail to give relief. However, man finds it more
difficult than any other animal to procure &s;leep: and &s;ome are obliged to
court its approaches for &s;everal hours together, before they incline to
re&s;t. It is in vain that all light is excluded; that all &s;ounds are
removed; that warmth and &s;oftne&s;s con&s;pire to invite it; the re&s;tle&s;s
and bu&s;y mind &s;till retains its former activity; and rea&s;on, that
wi&s;hes to lay down the reins, in &s;pite of her&s;elf, is obliged to maintain
them. In this di&s;agreeable &s;tate, the mind pa&s;&s;es from thought to
thought, willing to lo&s;e the di&s;tinct|ne&s;s of perception, by encrea&s;ing
the multitude of the images. At la&s;t, when the approaches of &s;leep are
near, every object of the imagination begins to mix with that next it; their
outlines become, in a manner, rounder; a part of their di&s;tinctions fade
away; and &s;leep, that en&s;ues, fa&s;hions out a dream from the
remainder.</P>
<P>If then it &s;hould be a&s;ked from what cau&s;e this &s;tate of
repo&s;e proceeds, or in what man|ner &s;leep thus binds us for &s;everal hours
to|gether, I mu&s;t fairly confe&s;s my ignorance, although it is ea&s;y to
tell what philo&s;ophers &s;ay upon the &s;ubject. Sleep, &s;ays one of
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rohault.</BIBL></NOTE>, 
<PB N="137" REF="141"> con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;carcity of &s;pirits, by which the
orifices or pores of the nerves in the brain, through which the &s;pirits
u&s;ed to flow into the nerves, being no longer kept open by the fre|quency of
the &s;pirits, &s;hut of them&s;elves; thus the nerves, wanting a new &s;upply
of &s;pirits, become lax, and unfit to convey any impre&s;&s;ion to the brain.
All this, however, is explaining a very great ob&s;curity by &s;omewhat more
ob|&s;cure: leaving, therefore, tho&s;e &s;pirits to open and &s;hut the
entrances to the brain, let us be contented with &s;imply enumerating the
effects of &s;leep upon the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In &s;leep, the whole nervous frame is re|laxed, while the heart and
the lungs &s;eem more forcibly exerted. This fuller circulation pro|duces
al&s;o a &s;welling of the mu&s;cles, as they al|ways find who &s;teep with
ligatures on any part of their body. This encrea&s;ed circulation al&s;o, may
be con&s;idered as a kind of exerci&s;e, which is continued through the frame;
and, by this, the per&s;piration becomes more copious, al|though the appetite
for food is entirely taken away. Too much &s;leep dulls the apprehen&s;ion,
weakens the memory, and unfits the body for labour. On the contrary, &s;leep
too much abridged, emaciates the frame, produces me|lancholy, and con&s;umes
the con&s;titution. It requires &s;ome care, therefore, to regulate the 
<PB N="138" REF="142"> quantity of &s;leep, and ju&s;t to take as much as will
completely re&s;tore Nature, without op|pre&s;&s;ing it. The poor, as Otway
&s;ays, &s;leep little; forced, by their &s;ituation, to lengthen out their
labour to their nece&s;&s;ities, they have but a &s;hort interval for this
plea&s;ing refre&s;hment; and I have ever been of opinion, that bodily labour
demands a le&s;s quantity of &s;leep than mental. Labourers and artizans are
generally &s;atisfied with about &s;even hours; but I have known &s;ome
&s;cholars who u&s;ually &s;lept nine, and per|ceived their faculties no way
impaired by over|&s;leeping.</P>
<P>The famous Philip Barrettiere, who was con&s;idered as a prodigy of
learning at the age of fourteen, was known to &s;leep regularly twelve hours in
the twenty-four; the extreme activity of his mind, when awake, in &s;ome
mea|&s;ure called for an adequate alternation of re|po&s;e: and, I am apt to
think, that when &s;tu|dents &s;tint them&s;elves in this particular, they
le&s;&s;en the waking powers of the imagination, and unfit it for its mo&s;t
&s;trenuous exertions. Animals, that &s;eldom think, as was &s;aid, can very
ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with &s;leep; and of men, &s;uch as think lea&s;t, will
very probably be &s;a|tisfied with the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare. A life of &s;tudy,
it is well known, unfits the body for receiving this gentle refre&s;hment; the
approaches of <PB N="139" REF="143"> &s;leep are driven off by thinking: when,
there|fore, it comes at la&s;t, we &s;hould not be too ready to interrupt its
continuance.</P>
<P>Sleep is, indeed, to &s;ome, a very agreeable period of their
exi&s;tence: and it has been a que&s;tion in the &s;chools, which was mo&s;t
happy, the man who was a beggar by night, and a king by day; or he who was a
beggar by day, and a king by night? It is given in favour of the nightly
monarch, by him who fir&s;t &s;tarted the que&s;tion: for the dream, &s;ays he,
gives the full enjoyment of the dignity, without its attendant inconveniences;
while, on the other hand, the king, who &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf degraded, feels
all the mi&s;ery of his fallen fortune, without trying to find the comforts of
his humble &s;ituation. Thus, by day, both &s;tates have their peculiar
di&s;tre&s;&s;es: but, by night, the exalted beggar is perfectly ble&s;&s;ed,
and the king completely mi|&s;erable. All this, however, is rather fanciful
than ju&s;t; the plea&s;ure dreams can give us, &s;el|dom reaches to our waking
pitch of happine&s;s: the mind often, in the mid&s;t of its highe&s;t
vi|&s;ionary &s;atisfactions, demands of it&s;elf, whether it does not owe them
to a dream; and fre|quently awakes with the reply.</P>
<P>But it is &s;eldom, except in ca&s;es of the highe&s;t delight, or
the mo&s;t extreme unea&s;ine&s;s, that <PB N="140" REF="144"> the mind has
power thus to di&s;engage it&s;elf from the dominion of fancy. In the ordinary
cour&s;e of its operations, it &s;ubmits to tho&s;e numberle&s;s phanta&s;tic
images that &s;ucceed each other, and which, like many of our waking thoughts,
are generally forgotten. Of the&s;e, however, if any, by their oddity, or their
con|tinuance, affect us &s;trongly, they are then re|membered; and there have
been &s;ome who felt their impre&s;&s;ions &s;o &s;trongly, as to mi&s;take
them for realities, and to rank them among the pa&s;t actions of their
lives.</P>
<P>There are others, upon whom dreams &s;eem to have a very different
effect; and who, with|out &s;eeming to remember their impre&s;&s;ions the next
morning, have yet &s;hewn, by their actions during &s;leep, that they were very
powerfully impelled by their dominion. We have num|berle&s;s in&s;tances of
&s;uch per&s;ons, who, while a&s;leep, have performed many of the ordinary
duties to which they had been accu&s;tomed when waking; and, with a ridiculous
indu&s;try, have completed by night, what they failed doing by day. We are
told, in the German ephemerides, of a young &s;tudent, who being enjoined a
&s;evere exerci&s;e by his tutor, went to bed, de&s;pairing of accompli&s;hing
it. The next morning, awaking, to his great &s;urprize he found the ta&s;k
fairly <PB N="141" REF="145"> written out, and fini&s;hed in his own
hand|writing. He was at fir&s;t, as the account has it, induced to a&s;cribe
this &s;trange production to the operations of an infernal agent; but his
tutor, willing to examine the affair to the bot|tom, &s;et him another
exerci&s;e, &s;till more &s;evere than the former; and took precautions to
ob|&s;erve his conduct the whole night. The young gentleman, upon being &s;o
&s;everely ta&s;ked, felt the &s;ame inquietude that he had done on the former
occa&s;ion; went to bed gloomy and pen|&s;ive, pondering on the next day's
duty, and, after &s;ome time, fell a&s;leep. But &s;hortly after, his tutor,
who continued to ob&s;erve him from a place that was concealed, was &s;urprized
to &s;ee him get up, and very deliberately go to the table; there he took out
pen, ink, and paper, drew him&s;elf a chair, and &s;ate very methodically to
thinking: it &s;eems, that his being a&s;leep, only &s;erved to &s;trengthen
the powers of his imagination; for he very quickly and ea&s;ily went through
the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, put his chair a&s;ide, and then returned to bed to
take out the re&s;t of his nap. What credit we are to give to this account, I
will not pretend to de|termine: but this may be &s;aid, that the book from
whence it is taken, has &s;ome good marks of veracity; for it is very learned,
and very dull, <PB N="142" REF="146"> and is written in a country well noted,
if not for truth, at lea&s;t for want of invention.</P>
<P>The ridiculous hi&s;tory of Arlotto is well known, who has had a
volume written, contain|ing a narrative of the actions of his life, not one of
which was performed while he was awake. He was an Italian Franci&s;can friar,
extremely rigid in his manners, and remarkably devout and learned in his daily
conver&s;ation. By night, however, and during his &s;leep, he played a very
different character from what he did by day, and was often detected in very
at|trocious crimes. He was at one time detected in actually attempting a rape,
and did not awake till the next morning, when he was &s;ur|prized to find
him&s;elf in the hands of ju&s;tice. His brothers of the convent often watched
him while he went very deliberately into the cha|pel, and there attempted to
commit &s;acrilege. They &s;ometimes permitted him to carry the chalice and the
ve&s;tments away into his own chamber, and the next morning amu&s;ed
them|&s;elves at the poor man's con&s;ternation for what he had done. But of
all his &s;leeping tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, that was the mo&s;t ridiculous, in
which he was called to pray for the &s;oul of a per&s;on departed. Arlotto,
after having very devoutly performed his duty, retired to a cham|ber 
<PB N="143" REF="147"> which was &s;hewn him, to re&s;t; but there he had no
&s;ooner fallen a&s;leep, than he began to reflect that the dead body had got a
ring upon one of the fingers, which might be u&s;eful to him: accordingly, with
a pious re&s;olution of &s;tealing it, he went down, undre&s;&s;ed as he was,
into a room full of women, and, with great compo&s;ure, endeavoured to &s;eize
the ring. The con&s;equence was, that he was taken before the inqui&s;ition for
witchcraft; and the poor creature had like to have been condemned, till his
pe|culiar character accidentally came to be known: however, he was ordered to
remain for the re&s;t of life in his own convent, and upon no account
what&s;oever to &s;tir abroad.</P>
<P>What are we to &s;ay to &s;uch actions as the&s;e; or how account
for this operation of the mind in dreaming? It &s;hould &s;eem, that the
ima|gination, by day, as well as by night, is always employed; and that often,
again&s;t our wills, it intrudes where it is lea&s;t commanded or de|&s;ired.
While awake, and in health, this bu&s;y principle cannot much delude us: it may
build ca&s;tles in the air, and rai&s;e a thou&s;and phantoms before us; but we
have every one of the &s;en&s;es alive, to bear te&s;timony to its fal&s;ehood.
Our eyes &s;hew us that the pro&s;pect is not pre&s;ent; our hearing, and our
touch, depo&s;e again&s;t its <PB N="144" REF="148"> reality; and our ta&s;te
and &s;melling are equally vigilant in detecting the impo&s;tor. Rea&s;on,
therefore, at once gives judgment upon the cau&s;e; and the vagrant intruder,
imagination, is impri&s;oned, or bani&s;hed from the mind. But in &s;leep it is
otherwi&s;e; having, as much as po&s;&s;ible, put our &s;en&s;es from their
duty, having clo&s;ed the eyes from &s;eeing, and the ears, ta&s;te, and
&s;melling, from their peculiar functions, and having dimini&s;hed even the
touch it&s;elf, by all the arts of &s;oftne&s;s, the imagination is then left
to riot at large, and to lead the under&s;tanding without an oppo&s;er. Every
incur&s;ive idea then becomes a reality; and the mind, not having one power
that can prove the illu&s;ion, takes them for truths. As in madne&s;s, the
&s;en&s;es, from &s;truggling with the imagination, are at length forced to
&s;ubmit, &s;o, in &s;leep, they &s;eem for a while &s;oothed into the like
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: the &s;malle&s;t violence exerted upon any one of them,
however, rouzes all the re&s;t in their mu|tual defence; and the imagination,
that had for a while told its thou&s;and fal&s;hoods, is totally driven away,
or only permitted to pa&s;s under the cu&s;tody of &s;uch as are every moment
ready to detect its impo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Seeing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is
taken from Mr. Buffon. I believe the reader will readily excu&s;e any apology;
and, perhaps, may wi&s;h that I had taken this liberty much more fre|quently.
What I add is marked, as in a former in&s;tance, with inverted commas,
"thus."</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"HAVING mentioned the &s;en&s;es as cor|recting the
errors of the imagination, and as forcing it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to bring us
ju&s;t information, it will naturally follow that we &s;hould examine the
nature of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es them|&s;elves: we &s;hall thus be enabled to &s;ee
how far they al&s;o impo&s;e on us, and how far they contribute to correct each
other. Let it be ob&s;erved, however, that in this we are nei|ther giving a
treati&s;e of optics, or phonics, but an hi&s;tory of our own perceptions; and
to tho&s;e we chiefly confine our&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>The eyes very &s;oon begin to be formed in the human embryo, and in
the chicken al&s;o. Of all the parts which the animal has double, the eyes are
produced the &s;oone&s;t, and appear the mo&s;t prominent. It is true, indeed,
that in vivi|parous animals, and particularly in man, they 
<PB N="146" REF="150"> are not &s;o large in proportion, at fir&s;t, as in the
oviparous kinds; neverthele&s;s, they are more &s;peedily developed, when they
begin to appear, than any other parts of the body. It is the &s;ame with the
organ of hearing; the little bones that go to compo&s;e the internal parts of
the ear, are entirely formed before the other bones, though much larger, have
acquired any part of their growth, or &s;olidity. Hence it appears, that
tho&s;e parts of the body which are fur|ni&s;hed with the greate&s;t quantity
of nerves, are the fir&s;t in forming. Thus the brain, and the &s;pinal marrow,
are the fir&s;t &s;een begun in the embryo; and, in general, it may be &s;aid,
that wherever the nerves go, or &s;end their branches in great numbers, there
the parts are &s;oone&s;t begun, and the mo&s;t completely fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>If we examine the eyes of a child &s;ome hours, or even &s;ome days
after its birth, it will be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned that it, as yet, makes no
u&s;e of them. The humours of the organ not hav|ing as yet acquired a
&s;ufficient con&s;i&s;tence, the rays of light &s;trike but confu&s;edly upon
the retina, or expan&s;ion of nerves at the back of the eye. It is not till
about a month after they are born, that children fix them upon objects; for,
before that time, they turn them indi&s;criminately every where, without
appearing <PB N="147" REF="151"> to be affected by any. At &s;ix, or &s;even
weeks old, they plainly di&s;cover a choice in the objects of their attention;
they fix their eyes upon the mo&s;t brilliant colours, and &s;eem peculiarly
de|&s;irous of turning them towards the light. Hi|therto, however, they only
&s;eem to fortify the organ for &s;eeing di&s;tinctly; but they have &s;till
many illu&s;ions to correct.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great error in vi&s;ion is, that the eye inverts every
object; and it in reality appears to the child, until the touch has &s;erved to
un|deceive it, turned up&s;ide down. A &s;econd er|ror in vi&s;ion is, that
every object appears double. The &s;ame object forms it&s;elf di&s;tinctly upon
each eye; and is con&s;equently &s;een twice. This er|ror, al&s;o, can only be
corrected by the touch; and although, in reality, every object we &s;ee appears
inverted, and double, yet the judg|ment, and habit, have &s;o often corrected
the &s;en&s;e, that we no longer &s;ubmit to its impo&s;i|tion, but &s;ee every
object in its ju&s;t po&s;ition, the very in&s;tant it appears. Were we,
there|fore, deprived of feeling, our eyes would not only mi&s;repre&s;ent the
&s;ituation, but al&s;o the number of all things round us.</P>
<P>To convince us that we &s;ee objects inverted, we have only to
ob&s;erve the manner in which images are repre&s;ented, coming through a
&s;mall <PB N="148" REF="152"> hole, in a darkened room. If &s;uch a &s;mall
hole be made in a dark room, &s;o that no light can come in, but through that,
all the objects without will be painted on the wall behind, but in an inverted
po&s;ition, their heads downwards. For as all the rays which pa&s;s from the
different parts of the object without, cannot enter the hole in the &s;ame
extent which they had in leav|ing the object, &s;ince, if &s;o, they would
require the apperture to be as large as the object; and, as each part, and
every point of the object, &s;ends forth the image of it&s;elf on every &s;ide,
and the rays, which form the&s;e images, pa&s;s from all points of the object
as from &s;o many centres, &s;o &s;uch only can pa&s;s through the &s;mall
apperture as come in oppo&s;ite directions. Thus the little apperture becomes a
centre for the entire ob|ject; through which the rays from the upper parts, as
well as from the lower parts of it, pa&s;s in converging directions; and,
con&s;e|quently, they mu&s;t cro&s;s each other in the cen|tral point, and thus
paint the objects behind, upon the wall, in an inverted po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is, in like manner, ea&s;y to conceive, that we &s;ee all objects
double, whatever our pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations may &s;eem to tell us to the
contrary. For, to convince us of this, we have only to compare the &s;ituation
of any one object on <PB N="149" REF="153"> &s;hutting one eye, and then
compare the &s;ame &s;ituation by &s;hutting the other. If, for in&s;tance, we
hold up a finger, and &s;hut the right eye, we &s;hall find it hide a certain
part of the room; if again re&s;hutting the other eye, we &s;hall find that
part of the room vi&s;ible, and the finger &s;eeming to cover a part of the
room that had been vi&s;ible before. If we open both eyes, however, the part
covered will appear to lie between the two extremes. But, the truth is, we
&s;ee the object, our finger had covered, one image of it to the right, and the
other to the left; but, from habit, &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;ee but one image
placed between both; our &s;en&s;e of feeling having corrected the errors of
&s;ight. And thus, al&s;o, if in&s;tead of two eyes we had two hundred, we
&s;hould, at fir&s;t, fancy the objects encrea&s;ed in proportion, until one
&s;en&s;e had corrected the errors of another.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The having two eyes might thus be &s;aid to be
rather an inconvenience than a benefit, &s;ince one eye would an&s;wer the
purpo&s;es of &s;ight as well, and be le&s;s liable to illu&s;ion. But it is
other|wi&s;e; two eyes greatly contribute, if not to di|&s;tinct, at lea&s;t to
exten&s;ive vi&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lenoardo da
Vinci.</BIBL></NOTE>. When an object is placed at a moderate di&s;tance, by the
means of both eyes we &s;ee a larger &s;hare of it <PB N="150" REF="154"> than
we po&s;&s;ibly could with one; the right eye &s;eeing a greater portion of its
right &s;ide, and the left eye of its corre&s;pondent &s;ide. Thus both eyes,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ee round the ob|ject; and it is this that gives it, in
nature, that bold relievo, or &s;welling, with which they appear; and which no
painting, how exqui&s;ite &s;oever, can attain to. The painter mu&s;t be
contented with &s;hading on a flat &s;urface; but the eyes, in ob&s;erving
nature, do not behold the &s;hading only, but a part of the figure al&s;o, that
lies behind tho&s;e very &s;hadings, which gives it that &s;welling, which
painters &s;o ardently de|&s;ire, but can never fully imitate." 
<P>"There is another defect, which either of the eyes, taken
&s;ingly, would have, but which is corrected, by having the organ double. In
either eye there is a point, which has no vi&s;ion what&s;oever; &s;o that if
one of them only is em|ployed in &s;eeing, there is a part of the object to
which it is always totally blind. This is that part of the optic nerve where
its vein and artery run; which being in&s;en&s;ible, that point of the object
that is painted there mu&s;t continue un&s;een. To be convinced of this we have
only to try a very ea&s;y experiment. If we take three black patches, and
&s;tick them upon a white wall, about a foot di&s;tant from each 
<PB N="151" REF="155"> other, each about as high as the eye that is to
ob&s;erve them; then retiring &s;ix or &s;even feet back, and &s;hutting one
eye, by trying for &s;ome time, we &s;hall find, that while we di&s;tinctly
be|hold the black &s;pots that are to the right and left, that which is in the
middle remains to|tally un&s;een. Or, in other words, when we bring that part
of the eye, where the optic ar|tery runs, to fall upon the object, it will then
become invi&s;ible. This defect, however, in either eye, is always corrected by
both, &s;ince the part of the object that is un&s;een by one, will be very
di&s;tinctly perceived by the other."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ide the former defects we can have no idea of di&s;tances from
the &s;ight, without the help of touch. Naturally every object we &s;ee appears
to be within our eyes; and a child, who has as yet made but little u&s;e of the
&s;en&s;e of feeling, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that every thing it &s;ees makes a
part of it&s;elf. Such objects are only &s;een more or le&s;s bulky as they
approach, or recede from its eyes; &s;o that a fly that is near will ap|pear
larger than an ox at a di&s;tance. It is ex|perience alone that can rectify
this mi&s;take; and a long acquaintance with the real &s;ize of every object,
quickly a&s;&s;ures us of the di&s;tance at which it is &s;een. The la&s;t man
in a file of &s;ol|diers appears in reality much le&s;s, perhaps ten 
<PB N="152" REF="156"> times more diminutive, than the man next to us; however,
we do not perceive this difference, but continue to think him of equal
&s;tature; for the numbers we have &s;een thus le&s;&s;ened by di|&s;tance, and
have found, by repeated experience, to be of the natural &s;ize, when we come
clo&s;er, in&s;tantly corrects the &s;en&s;e, and every object is perceived
with nearly its natural proportion. But it is otherwi&s;e, if we ob&s;erve
objects in &s;uch &s;ituations as we have not had &s;ufficient expe|rience to
correct the errors of the eye; if, for in&s;tance, we look at men from the top
of an high &s;teeple, they, in that ca&s;e, appear very much dimini&s;hed, as
we have not had an habit of correcting the &s;en&s;e in that po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Although a &s;mall degree of reflection will &s;erve to convince us
of the truth of the&s;e po|&s;itions, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;trengthen
them by an authority which cannot be di&s;puted. Mr. Che&s;elden having couched
a boy of thirteen for a cataract, who had hitherto been blind, and thus at once
having re&s;tored him to &s;ight, curiou&s;ly marked the progre&s;s of his
mind, upon that occa&s;ion. This youth, though he had been till then incapable
of &s;eeing, yet was not totally blind, but could tell day from night, as
per&s;ons in his &s;ituation always may. He could al&s;o, with a &s;trong
light, di&s;tingui&s;h black <PB N="153" REF="157"> from white, and either from
the vivid colour of &s;carlet; however, he &s;aw nothing of the form of bodies;
and, without a bright light, not even colours them&s;elves. He was, at fir&s;t,
couched only in one of his eyes; and, when he &s;aw for the fir&s;t time, he
was &s;o far from judg|ing of di&s;tances, that he &s;uppo&s;ed that his eyes
touched every object that he &s;aw, in the &s;ame manner as his hands might be
&s;aid to feel them. The objects that were mo&s;t agreeable to him were &s;uch
as were of plain &s;urfaces and regular figures; tho' he could as yet make no
judg|ment whatever of their different forms, nor give a rea&s;on why one
plea&s;ed him more than ano|ther. Although he could form &s;ome idea of colours
during his &s;tate of blindne&s;s, yet that was not &s;ufficient to direct him
at pre&s;ent; and he could &s;carcely be per&s;uaded that the colours he now
&s;aw were the &s;ame with tho&s;e he had for|merly conceived &s;uch erroneous
ideas of. He delighted mo&s;t in green; but black objects, as if giving him an
idea of his former blindne&s;s, he regarded with horror. He had, as was &s;aid,
no idea of forms; and was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h one object from another,
though never &s;o dif|ferent. When tho&s;e things were &s;hown him, which he
had been formerly familiarized to, by his feeling, he beheld them with
earne&s;tne&s;s, in <PB N="154" REF="158"> order to remember them a &s;econd
time; but, as he had too many to recollect at once, he for|got the greate&s;t
number; and for one he could tell, after &s;eeing, there was a thou&s;and he
was totally unacquainted with. He was very much much &s;urprized to find that
the&s;e things and per&s;ons he loved be&s;t were not the mo&s;t beauti|ful to
be &s;een; and even te&s;tified di&s;plea&s;ure in not finding his parents &s;o
hand&s;ome as he con|ceived them to be. It was near two months before he could
find that a picture re&s;embled a &s;olid body. Till then he only con&s;idered
it as a flat &s;urface, variou&s;ly &s;hadowed; but, when he began to perceive
that the&s;e kind of &s;hadings actually repre&s;ented human beings, he then
be|gan to examine, by his touch, whether they had not the u&s;ual qualities of
&s;uch bodies, and was greatly &s;urprized to find, what he expected a very
unequal &s;urface to be &s;mooth and even. He was then &s;hewn a miniature
picture of his father, which was contained in his mother's watch-ca&s;e, and he
readily perceived the re&s;emblance; but a&s;ked, with great a&s;toni&s;hment,
how &s;o large a face could be contained in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. It
&s;eemed as &s;trange to him as if a bu&s;hel was contained in a pint
ve&s;&s;el. At fir&s;t, he could bear but a very &s;mall quantity of light, and
he &s;aw every object much greater than the life; <PB N="155" REF="159"> but,
in proportion as he &s;aw objects that were really large, he &s;eemed to think
the former were dimini&s;hed; and although he knew the chamber where he was
contained in the hou&s;e, yet, until he &s;aw the latter, he could not be
brought to conceive how an hou&s;e could be larger than a chamber. Before the
opera|tion he had no great expectations from the plea&s;ure he &s;hould receive
from a new &s;en&s;e; he was only excited by the hopes of being able to read
and write; he &s;aid, for in&s;tance, that he could have no greater plea&s;ure
in walking, in the garden, with his &s;ight than he had with|out it, for he
walked there at his ea&s;e, and was acquainted with all the walks. He re|marked
al&s;o, with great ju&s;tice, that his former blindne&s;s gave him one
advantage over the re&s;t of mankind, which was that of being able to walk in
the night, with confidence and &s;ecurity. But, when he began to make u&s;e of
his new &s;en&s;e, he &s;eemed tran&s;ported beyond mea&s;ure. He &s;aid that
every new object was a new &s;ource of delight, and that his plea&s;ure was
&s;o great as to be pa&s;t expre&s;&s;ion. About a year after, he was brought
to Ep&s;om, where there is a very fine pro&s;pect, with which he &s;eemed
greatly charmed; and he called the land&s;cape before him a new method of
&s;eeing. He was couched <PB N="156" REF="160"> in the other eye, a year after
the former, and the operation &s;ucceeded equally well: when he &s;aw with both
eyes, he &s;aid that objects appeared to him twice as large as when he &s;aw
but with one; however, he did not &s;ee them doubled, or at lea&s;t he &s;hewed
no marks as if he &s;aw them &s;o. Mr. Che&s;elden mentions in&s;tances of many
more that were re&s;tored to &s;ight in this manner; they all &s;eemed to
concur in their perceptions with this youth; and they all &s;eemed particularly
embarra&s;&s;ed in learning how to direct their eyes to the objects they
wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>In this manner it is that our feeling corrects the &s;en&s;e of
&s;eeing, and that objects which ap|pear of very different &s;izes, at
different di|&s;tances, are all reduced, by experience, to their natural
&s;tandard. 
<Q REND="inline">"But not the feeling only, but al&s;o the colour,
and brightne&s;s of the ob|ject, contributes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming an idea of the di&s;tance at which it appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon gives a different theory, for which I mu&s;t refer the
reader to the original. That I have given, I take to be ea&s;y, and
&s;atisfactory enough.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e which we &s;ee mo&s;t &s;trongly marked
with light and &s;hade, we readily know to be nearer than tho&s;e on which the
colours are more faintly &s;pread, and that, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, take a part
of their hue from the air <PB N="157" REF="161"> between us and them. Bright
objects al&s;o, are &s;een at a greater di&s;tance than &s;uch as are
ob|&s;cure, and, mo&s;t probably, for this rea&s;on, that, being le&s;s
&s;imilar in colour to the air which interpo&s;es, their impre&s;&s;ions are
le&s;s effaced by it, and they continue more di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible. Thus a
black and di&s;tant object is not &s;een &s;o far off as a bright and
glittering one; and a fire by night is &s;een much farther off than by
day."</Q></P>
<P>The power of &s;eeing objects at a di&s;tance is very rarely equal
in both eyes. When this inequality is in any great degree, the per&s;on &s;o
circum&s;tanced then makes u&s;e only of one eye, &s;hutting that which &s;ees
the lea&s;t, and employ|ing the other with all its power. And hence proceeds
that aukward look which is known by the name of &s;trabi&s;m.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons to induce us to think that &s;uch as are
near &s;ighted &s;ee objects larger than other per&s;ons; and yet the contrary
is mo&s;t certainly true, for they &s;ee them le&s;s. Mr. Buffon informs us
that he him&s;elf is &s;hort &s;ighted, and that his left eye is &s;tronger
than his right. He has very frequently experienced, upon looking at any object,
&s;uch as the letters of a book, that they appear le&s;s to the weake&s;t eye;
and that when he places the book, &s;o as that the letters appear double, the
images of <PB N="158" REF="162"> the left eye, which is &s;tronge&s;t, are
greater than tho&s;e of the right, which is the mo&s;t feeble. He has examined
&s;everal others, who were in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and has always found
that the be&s;t eye &s;aw every object the large&s;t. This he a&s;cribes to
habit; for near &s;ighted people being accu&s;tomed to come clo&s;e to the
object, and view but a &s;mall part of it at a time, the habit en&s;ues, when
the whole of an object is &s;een, and it appears le&s;s to them than to
others.</P>
<P>Infants having their eyes le&s;s than tho&s;e of adults, mu&s;t
&s;ee objects al&s;o &s;maller in propor|tion. For the image formed on the back
of the eye will be large, as the eye is capacious; and infants, having it not
&s;o great, cannot have &s;o large a picture of the object. This may be a
rea&s;on al&s;o why they are unable to &s;ee &s;o di|&s;tinctly, or at &s;uch
di&s;tances as per&s;ons arrived at maturity.</P>
<P>Old men, on the contrary, &s;ee bodies clo&s;e to them very
indi&s;tinctly, but bodies at a great di|&s;tance from them with more
preci&s;ion; and this may happen from an alteration in the coats, or, perhaps,
humours of the eye; and not, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, from their dimunition. The
cornea, for in&s;tance, may become too rigid to adapt it&s;elf, and take a
proper convexity for &s;eeing <PB N="159" REF="163"> minute objects; and its
very flatne&s;s will be &s;uf|ficient to fit it for di&s;tant vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>When we ca&s;t our eyes upon an object ex|tremely brilliant, or when
we fix and detain them too long upon the &s;ame object, the organ is hurt and
fatigued, its vi&s;ion becomes indi&s;tinct, and the image of the body, which
has thus too violently, or too per&s;everingly employed us, is painted upon
every thing we look at, and mixes with every object that occurs. 
<Q REND="inline">"And this is an obvious con&s;equence of the eye
taking in too much light, either immediately, or by reflexion. Every body
what&s;oever that is ex|po&s;ed to the light, for a time, drinks in a quan|tity
of its rays, which, being brought into dark|ne&s;s, it cannot in&s;tantly
di&s;charge. Thus the hand, if it be expo&s;ed to broad day light, for &s;ome
time, and then immediately &s;natched into a dark room, will appear &s;till
luminous; and it will be &s;ome time before it is totally dark|ened. It is thus
with the eye; which, either by an in&s;tant gaze at the &s;un, or a &s;teady
con|tinuance, upon &s;ome le&s;s brilliant object, has taken in too much light;
its humours are, for a while, unfit for vi&s;ion, until that be di&s;charged,
and room made for rays of a milder nature."</Q> How dangerous the looking upon
bright and luminous objects is to the &s;ight, may be ea&s;ily 
<PB N="160" REF="164"> &s;een, from &s;uch as live in countries, covered for
mo&s;t part of the year with &s;now, who become generally blind before their
time. Travellers them&s;elves, who cro&s;s the&s;e countries, are obliged to
wear a crape before their eyes, to &s;ave their eyes, which would otherwi&s;e
be ren|dered totally un&s;erviceable; and it is equally dangerous in the
&s;andy plains of Africa. The reflexion of the light is there &s;o &s;trong
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain the effect, with|out incurring the
danger of lo&s;ing one's &s;ight entirely. Such per&s;ons, therefore, as read,
or write for any continuance, &s;hould chu&s;e a mo|derate light, in order to
&s;ave their eyes; and, although it may &s;eem in&s;ufficient at fir&s;t, the
eye will accu&s;tom it&s;elf to the &s;hade, by de|grees, and be le&s;s hurt by
the want of light than the exce&s;s.</P>
<P>"It is, indeed, &s;urprizing how far the eye can accommodate
it&s;elf to darkne&s;s, and make the be&s;t of a gloomy &s;ituation. When
fir&s;t taken from the light, and brought into a dark room, all things
di&s;appear; or, if any thing is &s;een, it is only the remaining radiations
that &s;till continue in the eye. But, after a very little time, when the&s;e
are &s;pent, the eye takes the advantage of the &s;malle&s;t ray that happens
to enter; and this alone would, in time, &s;erve for many of the purpo&s;es of
life. There was a <PB N="161" REF="165"> gentleman of great courage and
under&s;tanding, as we are told, by Boyle, who wasa major under King Charles
the Fir&s;t. This unfortunate man &s;haring in his ma&s;ter's misfortunes, and
being forced abroad, ventured at Madrid to do his king a &s;ignal &s;ervice;
but, unluckily, failed in the at|tempt. In con&s;equence of this, he was
in&s;tantly ordered to a dark and di&s;mal dungeon, into which the light never
entered, and into which there was no opening but by an hole at the top; down
which the keeper put his provi&s;ions, and pre&s;ently clo&s;ed it again on the
other &s;ide. In this manner the unfortunate loyali&s;t conti|nued for &s;ome
weeks, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and di&s;con&s;olate; but, at la&s;t, began to think he
&s;aw &s;ome little glimmering of light. This internal dawn &s;eemed to
encrea&s;e from time to time, &s;o that he could not only di&s;cover the parts
of his bed, and &s;uch other large objects, but, at length, he even be|gan to
perceive the mice that frequented his cell; and &s;aw them as they ran about
the floor, eating the crumbs of bread that happened to fall. After &s;ome
months confinement he was at la&s;t &s;et free; but, &s;uch was the effect of
the darkne&s;s upon him, that he could not for &s;ome days venture to leave his
dungeon, but was obliged to accu&s;tom him&s;elf by degrees to the light of the
day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter is
taken from Mr. Buffon, except where marked by inverted commas.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AS the &s;en&s;e of hearing, as well as of &s;ight, gives us notice
of remote objects, &s;o, like that, it is &s;ubject to &s;imilar errors, being
capable of impo&s;ing on us upon all occa&s;ions, where we cannot rectify it by
the &s;en&s;e of feeling. We can have from it no di&s;tinct intelligence of the
di&s;tance from whence a &s;ounding body is heard; a great noi&s;e far off, and
a &s;mall one very near, produce the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation; and, unle&s;s we
re|ceive information from &s;ome other &s;en&s;e, we can never di&s;tinctly
tell whether the &s;ound be a great or a &s;mall one. It is not till we have
learned, by experience, that the particular &s;ound which is heard, is of a
peculiar kind; then we can judge of the di&s;tance from whence we hear it. When
we know the tone of the bell, we can then judge how far it is from us.</P>
<P>Every body that &s;trikes again&s;t another pro|duces a &s;ound,
which is &s;imple, and but one in bodies which are not ela&s;tic, but which is
often repeated in &s;uch as are. If we &s;trike a bell, or 
<PB N="163" REF="167"> a &s;tretched &s;tring, for in&s;tance, which are both
ela&s;tic, a &s;ingle blow produces a &s;ound, which is repeated by the
undulations of the &s;onorous body, and which is multiplied as often as it
happens to undulate, or vibrate. The&s;e undu|lations each &s;trike their own
peculiar blow; but they &s;ucceed &s;o fa&s;t, one behind the other, that the
ear &s;uppo&s;es them one continued &s;ound; whereas, in reality, they make
many. A per|&s;on who &s;hould, for the fir&s;t time, hear the toll of the
bell, would, very probably, be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e breaks of
&s;ound; and, in fact, we can readily our&s;elves perceive an inten&s;ion and
remi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ound.</P>
<P>In this manner, &s;ounding bodies are of two kinds; tho&s;e
unela&s;tic ones, which being &s;truck, return but a &s;ingle &s;ound; and
tho&s;e more ela&s;tic returning a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds; which uniting
together form a tone. This tone may be con|&s;idered as a great number of
&s;ounds, all pro|duced one after the other, by the &s;ame body, as we find in
a bell, or the &s;tring of an harp|&s;ichord, which continues to &s;ound for
&s;ome time after it is &s;truck. A continuing tone may be al&s;o produced from
a nonela&s;tic body, by repeating the blow quick and often, as when we beat a
drum, or when we draw a bow along the &s;tring of a fiddle.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="168">Con&s;idering the &s;ubject in this light, if
we &s;hould multiply the number of blows, or repeat them at quicker intervals
upon the &s;ounding body, as upon the drum, for in&s;tance, it is evi|dent that
this will have no effect in altering the tone; it will only make it either more
even or more di&s;tinct. But it is otherwi&s;e, if we en|crea&s;e the force of
the blow; if we &s;trike the body with double weight, this will produce a tone
twice as loud as the former. If, for in|&s;tance, I &s;trike a table with a
&s;witch, this will be very different from the &s;ound produced by &s;triking
it with a cudgel. From hence, there|fore, we may infer, that all bodies give a
louder and graver tone, not in proportion to the num|ber of times they are
&s;truck, but in proportion to the force that &s;trikes them. And, if this be
&s;o, tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who make the tone of a &s;onorous body, of a bell,
or the &s;tring of an harp&s;ichord, for in&s;tance, to depend upon the number
only of its vibrations, and not the force, have mi&s;taken what is only an
effect for a cau&s;e. A bell, or an ela&s;tic &s;tring, can only be
con&s;idered as a drum beaten; and the fre|quency of the blows can make no
alteration what&s;oever in the tone. The large&s;t bells, and the longe&s;t and
thicke&s;t &s;trings, have the mo&s;t forceful vibrations; and, therefore,
their tones are the mo&s;t loud and the mo&s;t grave.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169">To know the manner in which &s;ounds thus
produced become plea&s;ing, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, no one continuing tone,
how loud or &s;welling &s;oever, can give us &s;atisfaction; we mu&s;t have a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, and tho&s;e in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing proportion. The
nature of this pro|portion may be thus conceived. If we &s;trike a body
incapable of vibration with a double force, or, what amounts to the &s;ame
thing, with a double ma&s;s of matter, it will produce a &s;ound that will be
doubly grave. Mu&s;ic has been &s;aid, by the ancients, to have been fir&s;t
invented from the blows of different hammers on an an|vil. Suppo&s;e then we
&s;trike an anvil with an hammer of one pound weight, and again with an hammer
of two pounds, it is plain that the two pound hammer will produce a &s;ound
twice as grave as the former. But if we &s;trike with a two pound hammer, and
then with a three pound, it is evident that the latter will pro|duce a &s;ound
one third more grave than the former. If we &s;trike the anvil with a three
pound hammer, and then with a four pound, it will likewi&s;e follow that the
latter will be a quarter part more grave than the former. Now, in the comparing
between all tho&s;e &s;ounds, it is obvious that the difference between one and
two is more ea&s;ily perceived than between two <PB N="166" REF="170"> and
three, three and four, or any numbers &s;uc|ceeding in the &s;ame proportion.
The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds will be, therefore, plea&s;ing in pro|portion
to the ea&s;e with which they may be di|&s;tingui&s;hed. That &s;ound which is
double the former, or, in other words, the octave to the preceding tone, will
of all others be the mo&s;t plea&s;ing harmony. The next to that, which is as
two to three, or, in other words, the third, will be mo&s;t agreeable. And thus
univer&s;ally, tho&s;e &s;ounds who&s;e differences may be mo&s;t ea&s;ily
compared are the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;icians, therefore, have contented
them|&s;elves with &s;even different proportions of &s;ound, which are called
notes, and which &s;ufficiently an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of plea&s;ure. Not
but that they might adopt a greater diver&s;ity of proportions; and &s;ome have
actually done &s;o; but, in the&s;e, the differences of the proportion are &s;o
imperceptible, that the ear is rather fa|tigued than plea&s;ed in making the
di&s;tinction. In order, however, to give variety, they have admitted half
tones; but, in all the countries where mu&s;ic is yet in its infancy, they have
re|jected &s;uch; and they can find mu&s;ic in none but the obvious ones. The
Chine&s;e, for in|&s;tance, have neither flats nor &s;harps in their mu&s;ic;
but the intervals between their other notes, are in the &s;ame proportion with
ours. 
<P><PB N="167" REF="171">"Many more barbarous nations have their
peculiar in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; and, what is re|markable, the proportion
between their notes is in all the &s;ame as in ours. This is not the place for
entering into the nature of the&s;e &s;ounds, their effects upon the air, or
their con&s;onances with each other. We are not now giving an hi&s;tory of
&s;ound, but of human perception.</P> 
<P>"All countries are plea&s;ed with mu&s;ic; and, if they have not
&s;kill enough to produce har|mony, at lea&s;t they &s;eem willing to
&s;ub&s;titute noi&s;e. Without all que&s;tion, noi&s;e alone is &s;ufficient
to operate powerfully on the &s;pirits; and, if the mind be already
predi&s;po&s;ed to joy, I have &s;eldom found noi&s;e fail of encrea&s;ing it
into rapture. The mind feels a kind of di&s;tracted plea&s;ure in &s;uch
powerful &s;ounds, braces up every nerve, and riots in the exce&s;s. But, as in
the eye, an immediate gaze upon the &s;un will di&s;turb the organ, &s;o, in
the ear, a loud, unex|pected noi&s;e, di&s;orders the whole frame, and
&s;ometimes di&s;turbs the &s;en&s;e ever after. The mind mu&s;t have time to
prepare for the expected &s;hock, and to give its organs the proper ten&s;ion
for its arrival."</P> 
<P>"Mu&s;ical &s;ounds, however, &s;eem of a dif|ferent kind. The&s;e
are generally mo&s;t plea&s;ing, which are mo&s;t unexpected. It is not from
bracing <PB N="168" REF="172"> up the nerves, but from the grateful
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ounds, that the&s;e become &s;o charming. There are
few, how indifferent &s;oever, but have at times felt their plea&s;ing
impre&s;&s;ion; and, perhaps, even tho&s;e who have &s;tood out again&s;t the
powerful per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ounds, only wanted the proper tune, or the proper
in&s;trument, to allure them."</P> 
<P>"The ancients give us a thou&s;and &s;trange in|&s;tances of the
effects of mu&s;ic, upon men and animals. The &s;tory of Arion's harp, that
ga|thered the dolphins to the &s;hip &s;ide, is well known; and, what is
remarkable, Schotteus a&s;&s;ures us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Quod occulis meis &s;pectavi. 
<BIBL>Schotti Magic. uni|ver&s;alis, pars ii. l. 1, p.
26.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, that he &s;aw a &s;imilar in&s;tance of fi&s;hes being
allured by mu&s;ic, him&s;elf. They tell us of di&s;ea&s;es that have been
cured, un|cha&s;tity corrected, &s;editions quelled, pa&s;&s;ions removed, and
&s;ometimes excited even to mad|ne&s;s. Doctor Wallis has endeavoured to
ac|count for the&s;e &s;urprizing effects, by a&s;cribing them to the novelty
of the art. For my own part, I can &s;carce he&s;itate to impute them to the
exaggeration of their writers. They are as hy|perbolical in the effects of
their oratory; and yet, we well know, there is nothing in the orations which
they have left us, capable of ex|citing <PB N="169" REF="173"> madne&s;s, or of
rai&s;ing the mind to that ungovernable degree of fury which they de|&s;cribe.
As they have exaggerated, therefore, in one in&s;tance, we may naturally
&s;uppo&s;e, that they have done the &s;ame in the other: and, in|deed, from
the few remains we have of their mu&s;ic, collected by Meibomius, one might be
apt to &s;uppo&s;e, there was nothing very powerful in what is lo&s;t. Nor does
any one of the ancient in&s;truments, &s;uch as we &s;ee them repre&s;ented in
&s;tatues, appear comparable to our fiddle."</P> 
<P>"However this be, we have many odd ac|counts, not only among them,
but the moderns, of the power of mu&s;ic; and it mu&s;t not be de|nied, but
that, on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions, mu&s;ical &s;ounds may have a very
powerful effect. I have &s;een all the hor&s;es and cows in a field, where
there were above an hundred, gather round a per&s;on that was blowing the
French horn, and &s;eeming to te&s;tify an aukward kind of &s;atisfaction. Dogs
are well known to be very &s;en&s;ible of different tones in mu&s;ic; and I
have &s;ometimes heard them &s;u&s;tain a very ridiculous part in a concert,
where their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance was neither expected nor de&s;ired."</P> 
<P>"We are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olaij Magni, l. 15,
hi&s;t. c. 28.</BIBL></NOTE>, of Henry IV. of Denmark, that being one day
de&s;irous of trying in per&s;on <PB N="170" REF="174"> whether a mu&s;ician
who boa&s;ted that he could excite men to madne&s;s, was not an impo&s;tor, he
&s;ubmitted to the operation of his &s;kill: but the con&s;equence was much
more terrible than he expected; for, becoming actually mad, he killed four of
his attendants, in the mid&s;t of his tran&s;ports. A contrary effect of
mu&s;ic we have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;t. de l'Accad. 1708, p.
22.</BIBL></NOTE>, in the cure of a madman, of Alais, in France, by mu&s;ic.
This man, who was a dancing-ma&s;ter, after a fever of five days, grew furious,
and &s;o ungovernable that his hands were obliged to be tied to his &s;ides:
what at fir&s;t was rage, in a &s;hort time was converted into &s;ilent
melancholy, which no arts could ex|hilerate, nor no medicines remove. In this
&s;ullen and dejected &s;tate, an old acquaintance accidentally came to enquire
after his health; he found him &s;itting up in bed, tied, and to|tally
regardle&s;s of every external object round him. Happening, however, to take up
a fiddle that lay in the room, and touching a favourite air, the poor madman
in&s;tantly &s;eemed to brighten up at the &s;ound; from a recumbent po&s;ture,
he began to &s;it up; and as the mu&s;ician continued playing, the patient
&s;eemed de&s;irous of dancing to the &s;ound: but he was tied, and incapable
of leaving his bed, &s;o that he could <PB N="171" REF="175"> only humour the
tune with his head, and that part of his arms which were at liberty. Thus the
other continued playing, and the dancing-ma&s;ter practiced his own art, as far
as he was able, for about a quarter of an hour, when &s;ud|denly falling into a
deep &s;leep, in which his di&s;|order came to a cri&s;is, he awaked perfectly
re|covered."</P> 
<P>"A thou&s;and other in&s;tances might be added, equally true: let it
&s;uffice to add one more, which is not true; I mean that of the taran|tula.
Every per&s;on who has been in Italy, now well knows, that the bite of this
animal, and its being cured by mu&s;ic, is all a deception. When &s;trangers
come into that part of the country, the country people are ready enough to take
money for dancing to the tarantula. A friend of mine had a &s;ervant who
&s;uffered him&s;elf to be bit; the wound, which was little larger than the
puncture of a pin, was unea&s;y for a few hours, and then became well without
any far|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Some of the country people, however, &s;till
make a tolerable livelihood of the credulity of &s;trangers, as the mu&s;ician
finds his account in it not le&s;s than the dancer."</P></Q></P>
<P> Sounds, like light, are not only exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed, but are
frequently reflected. The laws of this reflection, it is true, are not as well 
<PB N="172" REF="176"> under&s;tood as tho&s;e of light; all we know is, that
&s;ound is principally reflected by hard bo|dies; and their being hollow
al&s;o, &s;ometimes encrea&s;es the reverberation. 
<Q REND="inline">"No art, how|ever, can make an echo; and &s;ome, who
have be&s;towed great labour and expence upon &s;uch a project, have only
erected &s;hapele&s;s buildings, who&s;e &s;ilence was a mortifying lecture
upon their pre&s;umption."</Q></P>
<P> The internal cavity of the ear &s;eems to be fitted up for the
purpo&s;es of ecchoing &s;ound with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion. This part is
fa&s;hioned out in the temporal bone, like a cavern cut into a rock. 
<Q REND="inline">"In this the &s;ound is repeated and articulated;
and, as &s;ome anatomi&s;ts tell us, (for we have as yet but very little
knowledge on this &s;ubject) is beaten again&s;t the tympanum, or drum of the
ear, which moves four little bones joined thereto; and the&s;e move and
agi|tate the internal air which lies on the other &s;ide; and, la&s;tly, this
air &s;trikes and affects the au|ditory nerves, which carry the &s;ound to the
brain."</Q></P>
<P> One of the mo&s;t common di&s;orders in old age is deafne&s;s;
which probably proceeds from the rigidity of the nerves in the labyrinth of the
ear. This di&s;order al&s;o, &s;ometimes pro|ceeds from a &s;toppage of the
wax, which art <PB N="173" REF="177"> may ea&s;ily remedy. In order to know
whether the defect be an internal or an external one, let the deaf per&s;on put
a repeating watch into his mouth; and if he hears it &s;trike, he may be
a&s;&s;ured that his di&s;order proceeds from an external cau&s;e, and is, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, curable: 
<Q REND="inline">"for there is a pa&s;&s;age from the ears into the
mouth, by what anatomi&s;ts call the eu&s;tachian tube; and, by this
pa&s;&s;age, people often hear &s;ounds, when they are utterly with|out hearing
through the larger channel: and this al&s;o is the rea&s;on that we often &s;ee
per&s;ons who li&s;ten with great attention, hearken with their mouths open, in
order to catch all the &s;ound at every apperture."</Q></P>
<P>It often happens, that per&s;ons hear differently with one ear from
the other; and it is generally found that the&s;e have what is called, by
mu|&s;icians, a bad ear. Mr. Buffon, who has made many trials upon per&s;ons,
of this kind, always found that their defect in judging properly of &s;ounds,
proceeded from the inequality of their ears; and receiving by both, at the
&s;ame time, unequal &s;en&s;ations, they form an unju&s;t idea. In this
manner, as tho&s;e people hear fal&s;e, they al&s;o, without knowing it, &s;ing
fal&s;e. Tho&s;e per&s;ons al&s;o frequently deceive them&s;elves with regard
to the &s;ide from whence the &s;ound <PB N="174" REF="178"> comes, generally
&s;uppo&s;ing the noi&s;e to come on the part of the be&s;t ear.</P>
<P>Such as are hard of hearing, find the &s;ame advantage in the
trumpet made for this pur|po&s;e, that &s;hort-&s;ighted per&s;ons do from
gla&s;&s;es. The&s;e trumpets might be ea&s;ily enlarged, &s;o as to encrea&s;e
&s;ounds, in the &s;ame manner that the tele&s;cope does bodies: however, they
could be u&s;ed to advantage only in a place of &s;olitude and &s;tillne&s;s,
as the neighbouring &s;ounds would mix with the more di&s;tant, and the whole
would produce in the ear nothing but tumult and con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hearing is a much more nece&s;&s;ary &s;en&s;e to man than to
animals. With the&s;e it is only a warning again&s;t danger, or an
encouragement to mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In man, it is the &s;ource of mo&s;t
of his plea&s;ures; and without which, the re&s;t of his &s;en&s;es would be of
little benefit. A man born deaf, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be dumb; and his whole
&s;phere of knowledge mu&s;t be bounded only by &s;en&s;ual objects. We have an
in&s;tance of a young man who, being born deaf, was re&s;tored, at the age of
twenty-four, to per|fect hearing: the account is given in the Me|moirs of the
Academy of Sciences, 1703, page 18.</P>
<P>A young man, of the town of Chartres, <PB N="175" REF="179"> between
the age of twenty-three and twenty-four, the &s;on of a trade&s;man, and deaf
and dumb from his birth, began to &s;peak all of a &s;udden, to the great
a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole town. He gave them to under&s;tand that, about
three or four months before, he had heard the &s;ound of the bells for the
fir&s;t time, and was greatly &s;urprized at this new and unknown
&s;en|&s;ation. After &s;ome time, a kind of water i&s;&s;ued from his left
ear, and he then heard per|fectly well with both. During the&s;e three months,
he was &s;edulou&s;ly employed in li&s;ten|ing without &s;aying a word, and
accu&s;toming him&s;elf to &s;peak &s;oftly, &s;o as not to be heard, the words
pronounced by others. He la|boured hard al&s;o in perfecting him&s;elf in the
pronunciation, and in the ideas attached to every &s;ound. At length, having
&s;uppo&s;ed him|&s;elf qualified to break &s;ilence, he declared, that he
could now &s;peak, although as yet but im|perfectly. Soon after, &s;ome able
divines que&s;tioned him concerning his ideas of his pa&s;t &s;tate; and
principally with re&s;pect to God, his &s;oul, the morality or turpitude of
actions. The young man, however, had not driven his &s;olitary &s;peculations
into that channel. He had gone to ma&s;s indeed with his parents, had learned
to &s;ign him&s;elf with the cro&s;s, to kneel down and <PB N="176" REF="180">
a&s;&s;ume all the grimaces of a man that was pray|ing; but he did all this
without any manner of knowledge of the intention or the cau&s;e; he &s;aw
others do the like, and that was enough for him; he knew nothing even of death,
and it never entered into his head; he led a life of pure ani|mal in&s;tinct;
entirely taken up with &s;en&s;ible objects, and &s;uch as were pre&s;ent, he
did not &s;eem even to make as many reflections upon the&s;e, as might
rea&s;onably be expected from his improving &s;ituation: and yet, the young man
was not in want of under&s;tanding; but the under&s;tanding of a man, deprived
of all com|merce with others, is &s;o very confined, that the mind is in &s;ome
mea&s;ure totally under the con|trol of its immediate &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, it is very po&s;&s;ible to com|municate ideas to
deaf men, which they pre|viou&s;ly wanted, and even give them very pre|ci&s;e
notions of &s;ome ab&s;tract &s;ubjects, by means of &s;igns, and of letters. A
per&s;on born deaf, may, by time, and &s;ufficient pains, be taught to write
and read, to &s;peak, and, by the motions of the lips, to under&s;tand what is
&s;aid to him: however, it is probable that, as mo&s;t of the motions of
&s;peech are made within the mouth by the tongue, the knowledge from the motion
of the lips, is but very confined: 
<Q REND="inline">"neverthele&s;s, <PB N="177" REF="181"> I have
conver&s;ed with a gentleman thus taught, and in all the commonly occurring
que&s;tions, and the u&s;ual &s;alutations, he was ready enough, merely by
attending to the motion of the lips alone. When I ventured to &s;peak for a
&s;hort continuance, he was totally at a lo&s;s, although he under&s;tood the
&s;ubject, when written, ex|tremely well."</Q> Per&s;ons taught in this manner,
were at fir&s;t con&s;idered as prodigies; but there have been &s;o many
in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;s of late, and &s;o many are &s;kilful in the art of
in&s;tructing in this way, that, though &s;till a matter of &s;ome curio&s;ity,
it cea&s;es to be an object of wonder.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of &s;melling, feeling, and ta&s;ting.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal may be &s;aid to fill up that &s;phere which he can reach
by his &s;en&s;es; and is actually large in proportion to the &s;phere to which
its organ extends. By &s;ight, man's enjoyments are diffu&s;ed into a wide
circle; that of hearing, tho' le&s;s widely diffu&s;ed, neverthele&s;s extends
his powers; the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is more contracted &s;till; and the
ta&s;te and touch are the mo&s;t confined of all. Thus man enjoys very
di&s;tant objects, but with one &s;en&s;e only; more nearly he brings two
&s;en&s;es at once to bear upon them; his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling a&s;&s;i&s;ts
the other two, at its own di&s;tance; and of &s;uch objects, as a man, he may
be &s;aid to be in perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Each &s;en&s;e, however, the more it acts at a di|&s;tance, the more
capable it is of making combi|nations; and is, con&s;equently, the more
improve|able. Refined imaginations, and men of &s;trong minds, take more
plea&s;ure, therefore, in improv|ing the delights of the di&s;tant &s;en&s;es,
than in enjoying &s;uch as are &s;carce capable of improve|ment.</P>
<P>By combining the objects of the exten&s;ive <PB N="179" REF="183">
&s;en&s;es, all the arts of poetry, painting, and har|mony, have been
di&s;covered; but the clo&s;er &s;en&s;es, if I may &s;o call them, &s;uch as
&s;melling, ta&s;ting, and touching, are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as &s;imple as
they are limited, and admit of little variety. The man of imagination makes a
great and an artificial happine&s;s, by the plea&s;ure of altering and
combining; the &s;en&s;uali&s;t ju&s;t &s;tops where he began, and cultivates
only tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which he cannot improve. The &s;en&s;uali&s;t is
contented with tho&s;e enjoyments that are already made to his hand; but the
man of plea&s;ure is be&s;t plea&s;ed with growing happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;en&s;es, perhaps, there is not one in which man is
more inferior to other animals than in that of &s;melling. With man, it is a
&s;en&s;e that acts in a narrow &s;phere, and di&s;gu&s;ts almo&s;t as
frequently as it gives him plea&s;ure. With many other animals it is diffu&s;ed
to a very great extent; and never &s;eems to offend them. Dogs not only trace
the &s;teps of other animals, but al&s;o di&s;cover them by the &s;cent, at a
very great di&s;tance; and, while they are thus exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible of
all &s;mells, they &s;eem no way di&s;|gu&s;ted by any.</P>
<P>But, although this &s;en&s;e is, in general, &s;o very inferior in
man, it is much &s;tronger in tho&s;e nations that ab&s;tain from animal 
<PB N="180" REF="184"> food, than among us of Europe. The Bra|mins of India
have a power of &s;melling, as I am informed, equal to what it is in mo&s;t
other creatures. They can &s;mell the water which they drink, that to us
&s;eems quite inodorous; and have a word, in their language, which denotes a
country of fine water. We are told, al&s;o, that the Negroes of the Antilles,
by the &s;mell alone, can di&s;tingui&s;h between the foot&s;teps of a
Frenchman and a Negro. It is po&s;&s;ible, there|fore, that we may dull this
organ by our lux|urious way of living; and &s;acrifice to the plea|&s;ures of
ta&s;te tho&s;e which might be received from perfume.</P>
<P>However, it is a &s;en&s;e that we can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
di&s;pen&s;e with; and I have known many that wanted it entirely, with but very
little inconvenience from its lo&s;s. In a &s;tate of nature it is &s;aid to be
u&s;eful to us, in guiding us to proper nouri&s;hment, and deterring us from
that which is unwhole&s;ome; but, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;uch
information is but little wanted; and, indeed, but little attended to. In fact,
the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling gives us very often fal&s;e in|telligence. Many
things that have a di&s;agree|able odour are, neverthele&s;s, whole&s;ome, and
plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te; and &s;uch as make eating an art, &s;eldom think a
meal fit to plea&s;e the ap|petite <PB N="181" REF="185"> till it begins to
offend the no&s;e. On the other hand, there are many things that &s;mell mo&s;t
gratefully, and yet are noxious, or fatal to the con&s;titution. Some
phy&s;icians think that all perfumes, in general, are unwhole&s;ome; that they
relax the nerves, produce head aches, and even retard dige&s;tion. The machinel
apple, which is known to be deadly poi&s;on, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t
grateful odour. Some of tho&s;e mineral vapours that are often found fatal, in
the &s;tomach, &s;mell like the &s;weete&s;t flowers, and continue thus to
flatter till they de&s;troy. This &s;en&s;e, therefore, as it &s;hould &s;eem,
was never meant to direct us in the choice of food, but appears rather as an
attendant than a nece&s;&s;ary plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we examine the natives of different countries, or even
different natives of the &s;ame, we &s;hall find no plea&s;ure in which they
differ &s;o widely as that of &s;melling. Some per&s;ons are plea&s;ed with the
&s;mell of a ro&s;e; while I have known others that could not abide to have it
approach them. The &s;avage nations are highly delighted with the &s;mell of
a&s;&s;afoetida, which is to us the mo&s;t nau&s;eous &s;tink in nature. It
would in a manner &s;eem that our delight in per|fumes was made by habit; and
that a very little <PB N="182" REF="186"> indu&s;try could bring us totally to
invert the perception of odours.</P>
<P>Thus much is certain, that many bodies which at one di&s;tance are
an agreeable perfume, when nearer are a mo&s;t ungrateful odour. Mu&s;k, and
ambergrea&s;e, in &s;mall quantities, are con&s;idered by mo&s;t per&s;ons as
highly fragrant; and yet, when in larger ma&s;&s;es, their &s;cent is
in&s;ufferable. From a mixture of two bodies, each whereof is, of it&s;elf,
void of all &s;mell, a very powerful &s;mell may be drawn. Thus, by grinding
quick lime with &s;al-ammoniac, may be produced a very foetid mixture. On the
contrary, from a mixture of two bodies, that are &s;eparately di&s;|agreeable,
a very plea&s;ant aromatic odour may be gained. A mixture of aqua fortis with
&s;pirit of wine produces this effect. But not only the alterations of bodies,
by each other, but the &s;malle&s;t change in us, makes a very great
alte|ration in this &s;en&s;e, and frequently deprives us of it totally. A
&s;light cold often hinders us from &s;melling; and as often changes the nature
of odours. Some per&s;ons, from di&s;order, retain an incurable aver&s;ion to
tho&s;e &s;mells which mo&s;t plea&s;ed them before; and many have been known
to have an antipathy to &s;ome animals, who&s;e pre&s;ence they in&s;tantly
perceive by the &s;mell. From all this, therefore, the &s;en&s;e of 
<PB N="183" REF="187"> &s;melling appears to be an uncertain monitor, ea&s;ily
di&s;ordered, and not much mi&s;&s;ed when totally wanting.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e mo&s;t nearly allied to &s;melling is that of
ta&s;ting. This, &s;ome have been willing to con&s;ider merely as a nicer kind
of touch, and have undertaken to account, in a very me|chanical manner, for the
difference of &s;avours. Such bodies, &s;aid they, as are pointed, happen|ing
to be applied to the papillae of the tongue, excite a very powerful
&s;en&s;ation, and give us the idea of &s;altne&s;s. Such, on the contrary, as
are of a rounder figure, &s;lide &s;moothly along the papillae, and are
perceived to be &s;weet. In this manner they have, with minute labour, gone
through the variety of imagined forms in bo|dies, and have given them as
imaginary ef|fects. All we can preci&s;ely determine upon the nature of
ta&s;tes is, that the bodies to be ta&s;ted mu&s;t be either &s;omewhat
moi&s;tened, or, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;&s;olved by the &s;aliva before they
can produce a proper &s;en&s;ation: when both the tongue it&s;elf, and the body
to be ta&s;ted, are extremely dry, no ta&s;te whatever en&s;ues. The
&s;en&s;ation is then changed; and the tongue, in&s;tead of ta&s;ting, can only
be &s;aid, like any other part of the body, to feel the object.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="188">It is for this rea&s;on, that children have a
&s;tronger reli&s;h of ta&s;tes than tho&s;e who are more advanced in life.
This organ with them, from the greater moi&s;ture of their bodies, is kept in
greater perfection; and is, con&s;equently, better adapted to perform its
functions. Every per&s;on remembers how great a plea&s;ure he found in
&s;weets, while a child; but his ta&s;te growing more obtu&s;e, with age, he is
obliged to u&s;e ar|tificial means to excite it. It is then that he is found to
call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of poignant &s;auces, and &s;trong reli&s;hes, of
&s;alts and aromatics; all which the delicacy of his tender organ, in
child|hood, were unable to endure. His ta&s;te grows callous to the natural
reli&s;hes; and is artificially formed to others more unnatural; &s;o that the
highe&s;t epicure may be &s;aid to have the mo&s;t depraved ta&s;te; as it is
owing to the bluntne&s;s of his organs that he is obliged to have recour&s;e to
&s;uch a variety of expedients, to gratify his appetite.</P>
<P>As &s;mells are often rendered agreeable by habit, &s;o al&s;o
ta&s;tes may be. Tobacco, and coffee, &s;o plea&s;ing to many, are yet, at
fir&s;t, very di&s;agreeable to all. It is not without per|&s;everance that we
begin to have a reli&s;h for them; we force nature &s;o long, that what was
con&s;traint, in the beginning, at la&s;t becomes inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="189">The gro&s;&s;e&s;t, and yet the mo&s;t
u&s;eful of all the &s;en&s;es, is that of feeling. We are often &s;een to
&s;urvive under the lo&s;s of the re&s;t; but of this we can never be totally
deprived, but with life. Although this &s;en&s;e is diffu&s;ed over all parts
of the body, yet it mo&s;t frequently happens that tho&s;e parts which are
mo&s;t exerci&s;ed in touching, acquire the greate&s;t degree of accuracy. Thus
the fingers, by long habit, become greater ma|&s;ters in the art than any
others, even where the &s;en&s;ation is more delicate and fine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 80.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is from this
habit, therefore, and their peculiar forma|tion, and not, as is &s;uppo&s;ed,
from their being furni&s;hed with a greater quantity of nerves, that the
fingers are thus perfectly qualified to judge of forms. Blind men, who are
obliged to u&s;e them much oftener than we, have this &s;en&s;e much finer;
&s;o that the delicacy of the touch ari&s;es rather from the habit of
con&s;tantly employing the fingers, than from any fancied nervou&s;ne&s;s in
their conformation.</P>
<P>All animals that are furni&s;hed with hands<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 82.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;eem to have more
under&s;tanding than others. Monkeys have &s;o many actions, like tho&s;e of
men, that they appear to have &s;imilar ideas of the form of bodies. All other
creatures, de|prived of hands, can have no di&s;tinct ideas of 
<PB N="186" REF="190"> the &s;hape of the objects, by which they are
&s;ur|rounded, as they want this organ, which &s;erves to examine and mea&s;ure
their forms, their ri&s;ings and depre&s;&s;ions. A quadrupede probably
con|ceives as erroneous an idea of any thing near him, as a child would of a
rock, or a mountain, that it beheld at a di&s;tance. It may be for this
rea&s;on, that we often &s;ee them frighted at things with which they ought to
be better acquainted. Fi&s;hes, who&s;e bodies are covered with &s;cales, and
who have no organs for feeling, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all animals.
Serpents, that are likewi&s;e de&s;titute, are yet, by winding round &s;everal
bodies, better capable of judging of their form. All the&s;e, however, can have
but very imperfect ideas from feeling; and we have already &s;een, when
deprived of this &s;en&s;e, how little the re&s;t of the &s;en&s;es are to be
relied on.</P>
<P>The feeling, therefore, is the guardian, the judge, and the examiner
of all the re&s;t of the &s;en&s;es. It e&s;tabli&s;hes their information, and
detects their errors. All the other &s;en&s;es are altered by time, and
contradict their former evidence; but the touch &s;till continues the &s;ame;
and though extremely confined in its operations, yet it is never found to
deceive. The univer&s;e, to a man who had only u&s;ed the re&s;t of his
&s;en&s;es, would be but a &s;cene of il|lu&s;ion; <PB N="187" REF="191"> every
object mi&s;repre&s;ented, and all its properties unknown. Mr. Buffon has
ima|gined a man ju&s;t newly brought into exi&s;tence, de&s;cribing the
illu&s;ion of his fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations, and pointing out the &s;teps by which
he arrived at reality. He con&s;iders him as ju&s;t created, and awaking
amid&s;t the productions of Nature; and, to animate the narrative &s;till more
&s;trongly, has made his philo&s;ophical man a &s;peaker. The reader will no
doubt recollect Adam's &s;peech in Milton, as being &s;imilar. All that I can
&s;ay to obviate the imputation of plagiari&s;m is, that the one treats the
&s;ubject more as a poet, the other more as a philo&s;opher. The
philo&s;opher's man de&s;cribes his fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations in the following
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. vi. p. 88.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I well remember that joyful anxious mo|ment when I fir&s;t became
acquainted with my own exi&s;tence. I was quite ignorant of what I was, how I
was produced, or from whence I came. I opened my eyes: what an addition to my
&s;urprize! the light of the day, the azure vault of heaven, the verdure of the
earth, the chry&s;tal of the waters, all employed me at once, and animated and
filled me with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight. I at fir&s;t imagined that all
tho&s;e ob|jects <PB N="188" REF="192"> were within me, and made a part of
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, I turned my eyes to the &s;un; its
&s;plendor dazzled and over|powered me: I &s;hut them once more; and, to my
great concern, I &s;uppo&s;ed that, during this &s;hort interval of darkne&s;s,
I was again returning to nothing.</P>
<P>Afflicted, &s;eized with a&s;toni&s;hment, I pon|dered a moment on
this great change, when I heard a variety of unexpected &s;ounds. The
whi&s;tling of the wind, and the melody of the grove, formed a concert, the
&s;oft cadence of which &s;unk upon my &s;oul. I li&s;tened for &s;ome time,
and was per&s;uaded that all this mu&s;ic was within me.</P>
<P>Quite occupied with this new kind of ex|i&s;tence, I had already
forgotten the light which was my fir&s;t inlet into life; when I once more
opened my eyes, and found my&s;elf again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my former
happine&s;s. The gra|tification of the two &s;en&s;es at once, was a
plea|&s;ure too great for utterance.</P>
<P>I turned my eyes upon a thou&s;and various objects: I &s;oon found
that I could lo&s;e them, and re&s;tore them at will; and amu&s;ed my&s;elf
more at lei&s;ure with a repetition of this new-made power.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="193">I now began to gaze without emotion, and to
hearken with tranquillity, when a light breeze, the fre&s;hne&s;s of which
charmed me, wafted its perfumes to my &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, and gave me
&s;uch &s;atisfaction as even encrea&s;ed my &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>Agitated, rouzed by the various plea&s;ures of my new exi&s;tence, I
in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and per|ceived my&s;elf moved along, as if by &s;ome
un|known and &s;ecret power.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce proceeded forward, when the novelty of my &s;ituation
once more rendered me immoveable. My &s;urprize returned; I &s;up|po&s;ed that
every object around me had been in motion: I gave to them that agitation which
I produced by changing place; and the whole creation &s;eemed once more in
di&s;order.</P>
<P>I lifted my hand to my head; I touched my forehead; I felt my whole
frame: I then &s;up|po&s;ed that my hand was the principal organ of my
exi&s;tence; all its informations were di&s;tinct and perfect; and &s;o
&s;uperior to the &s;en&s;es I had yet experienced, that I employed my&s;elf
for &s;ome time in repeating its enjoyments: every part of my per&s;on I
touched, &s;eemed to touch my hand in turn; and gave back &s;en&s;ation for
&s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found, that this faculty was expanded over the whole
&s;urface of my body; and I now <PB N="190" REF="194"> fir&s;t began to
perceive the limits of my exi&s;t|ence, which I had in the beginning
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;pread over all the objects I &s;aw.</P>
<P>Upon ca&s;ting my eyes upon my body, and &s;urveying my own form, I
thought it greater than all the objects that &s;urrounded me. I gazed upon my
per&s;on with plea&s;ure; I exa|mined the formation of my hand, and all its
motions; it &s;eemed to me large or little in pro|portion as I approached it to
my eyes; I brought it very near, and it then hid almo&s;t every other object
from my &s;ight. I began &s;oon, however, to find that my &s;ight gave me
uncertain infor|mation, and re&s;olved to depend upon my feel|ing for
redre&s;s.</P>
<P>This precaution was of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice; I renewed my motions,
and walked forward with my face turned towards the heavens. I happened to
&s;trike lightly again&s;t a palm-tree, and this renewed my &s;urprize: I laid
my hand on this &s;trange body; it &s;eemed replete with new wonders, for it
did not return me &s;en&s;ation for &s;en&s;ation, as my former feelings had
done. I now, therefore, perceived that there was &s;ome|thing external, and
which did not make a part of my own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, re&s;olved to touch whatever I &s;aw, and vainly
attempted to touch the &s;un; <PB N="191" REF="195"> I &s;tretched forth my
arm, and felt only yielding air: at every effort, I fell from one &s;urprize
into another, for every object appeared equally near me; and it was not till
after an infinity of trials, that I found &s;ome objects further re|moved than
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Amazed with the illu&s;ions, and the uncer|tainty of my &s;tate, I
&s;at down beneath a tree; the mo&s;t beautiful fruits hung upon it, within my
reach; I &s;tretched forth my hand, and they in&s;tantly &s;eparated from the
branch. I was proud of being able to gra&s;p a &s;ub&s;tance with|out me; I
held them up, and their weight ap|peared to me like an animated power that
en|deavoured to draw them to the earth. I found a plea&s;ure in conquering
their re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I held them near my eye; I con&s;idered their form and beauty; their
fragrance &s;till more al|lured me to bring them nearer; I approached them to
my lips, and drank in their odours; the perfume invited my &s;en&s;e of
ta&s;ting, and I &s;oon tried a new &s;en&s;e&mdash;How new! how ex|qui&s;ite!
Hitherto I had ta&s;ted only of plea&s;ure; but now it was luxury. The power of
ta&s;ting gave me the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Flattered with this new acqui&s;ition, I con|tinued its exerci&s;e,
till an agreeable languor &s;tealing upon my mind, I felt all my limbs 
<PB N="192" REF="196"> become heavy, and all my de&s;ires &s;u&s;pended. My
&s;en&s;ations were now no longer vivid and di|&s;tinct; but &s;eemed to lo&s;e
every object, and pre|&s;ented only feeble images, confu&s;edly marked. At that
in&s;tant I &s;unk upon the flowery bank, and &s;lumber &s;eized me. All now
&s;eemed once more lo&s;t to me. It was then as if I was re|turning into my
former nothing. How long my &s;leep continued, I cannot tell; as I yet had no
perception of time. My awaking appeared like a &s;econd birth; and I then
perceived that I had cea&s;ed for a time to exi&s;t. This produced a new
&s;en&s;ation of fear; and from this inter|ruption in life, I began to conclude
that I was not formed to exi&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of doubt and perplexity, I began to harbour new
&s;u&s;picions; and to fear that &s;leep had robbed me of &s;ome of my late
powers; when, turning on one &s;ide, to re&s;olve my doubts, what was my
amazement, to behold another being, like my&s;elf, &s;tretched by my &s;ide!
New ideas now began to ari&s;e; new pa&s;&s;ions, as yet unperceived, with
fears, and plea&s;ures, all took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, and prompted my
curio&s;ity: love &s;erved to com|plete that happine&s;s which was begun in the
in|dividual; and every &s;en&s;e was gratified in all its varieties.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of old Age and Death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This
chapter is taken from Mr. Buffon, except where it is marked by inverted
commas.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing in nature has its improvement and decay. The human form
is no &s;ooner ar|rived at its &s;tate of perfection than it begins to decline.
The alteration is, at fir&s;t, in&s;en&s;ible; and, often, &s;everal years are
elap&s;ed before we find our&s;elves grown old. The news of this
di&s;|agreeable change, too generally, comes from without; and we learn from
others that we grow old, before we are willing to believe the report.</P>
<P>When the body has come to its full height, and is extended into its
ju&s;t dimen&s;ions; it then al&s;o begins to receive an additional bulk, which
rather loads than a&s;&s;i&s;ts it. This is formed from fat; which generally,
at the age of thirty-five, or forty, covers all the mu&s;cles, and inter|rupts
their activity. Every action is then per|formed with greater labour, and the
encrea&s;e of &s;ize only &s;erves as a forerunner of decay.</P>
<P>The bones, al&s;o, become every day more &s;o|lid. In the embryo
they are as &s;oft almo&s;t as the mu&s;cles and the fle&s;h; but, by de|grees,
<PB N="194" REF="198"> they harden, and acquire their natural vigour; but
&s;till, however, the circulation is carried on through them; and, how hard
&s;oever the bones may &s;eem, yet the blood holds its current through them as
through all other parts of the body. Of this we may be convinced, by an
experiment, which was fir&s;t accidentally di&s;|covered, by our ingenious
countryman Mr. Belcher. Perceiving, at a friend's hou&s;e, that the bones of
hogs, which were fed upon madder, were red, he tried it upon various animals,
by mixing this root with their u&s;ual food; and he found that it tinctured the
bones in all: an evident demon&s;tration that the juices of the body had a
circulation through the bones. He fed &s;ome animals alternately upon madder
and their common food, for &s;ome time, and he found their bones tinctured with
alternate layers, in conformity to their manner of living. From all this, he
naturally concluded, that the blood circulated through the bones as it does
through every other part of the body; and that, how &s;olid &s;oever they
&s;eemed, yet, like the &s;ofte&s;t parts, they were furni&s;hed, through all
their &s;ub&s;tance, with their proper canals. Never|thele&s;s, the&s;e canals
are of very different ca|pacities, during the different &s;tages of life. In
infancy they are capacious; and the blood flows <PB N="195" REF="199"> almo&s;t
as freely through the bones as through any other part of the body; in manhood
their &s;ize is greatly dimini&s;hed; the ve&s;&s;els are al|mo&s;t
imperceptible; and the circulation through them is proportionably &s;low. But,
in the de|cline of life, the blood, which flows through the bones, no longer
contributing to their growth, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;erve to encrea&s;e
their hardne&s;s. The channels, that every where run through the human frame,
may be compared to tho&s;e pipes that we every where &s;ee cru&s;ted on the
in&s;ide, by the water, for a long continuance, running through them. Both,
every day grow le&s;s and le&s;s, by the &s;mall rigid particles which are
de|po&s;ited within them. Thus as the ve&s;&s;els are by degrees dimini&s;hed,
the juices, al&s;o, which were nece&s;&s;ary for the circulation through them,
are dimini&s;hed in proportion; till, at length, in old age, tho&s;e props of
the human frame are not only more &s;olid but more brittle.</P>
<P>The cartilages, or gri&s;tles, which may be con&s;idered as bones
beginning to be formed, grow al&s;o more rigid. The juices circulating through
them, for there is a circulation through all parts of the body, every day
contributes to render them harder; &s;o that the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which in
youth are ela&s;tic, and pliant in age, become hard and bony. As the&s;e
cartilages <PB N="196" REF="200"> are generally placed near the joints, the
motion of the joints al&s;o, mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, become more difficult.
Thus, in old age, every ac|tion of the body is performed with labour; and the
cartilages, formerly &s;o &s;upple, will now &s;ooner break than bend.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"As the cartilages acquire hardne&s;s, and unfit the
joints for motion, &s;o al&s;o that mucous li|quor, which is always &s;eparated
between the joints, and which &s;erves, like oil to an hinge, to give them an
ea&s;y and ready play, is now grown more &s;canty. It becomes thicker, and more
clammy, more unfit for an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of motion; and from thence,
in old age, every joint is not only &s;tiff, but aukward. At every motion, this
clammy liquor is heard to crack; and it is not without the greate&s;t ef|fort
of the mu&s;cles that its re&s;i&s;tance is over|come. I have &s;een an old
per&s;on, that never moved a &s;ingle joint that did not thus give no|tice of
the violence that was done it."</Q></P>
<P>The membranes that cover the bones, the joints, and the re&s;t of
the body, become, as we grow old, more den&s;e and more dry. The&s;e which
&s;urround the bones, &s;oon cea&s;e to be duc|tile. The fibres, of which the
mu&s;cles or fle&s;h is compo&s;ed, become every day more rigid; and, while to
the touch the body &s;eems, as we ad|vance <PB N="197" REF="201"> in years, to
grow &s;ofter, it is, in reality, encrea&s;ing in hardne&s;s. It is the &s;kin,
and not the fle&s;h, that we feel upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. The fat, and the
flabbine&s;s of that, &s;eems to give an ap|pearance of &s;oftne&s;s, which the
fle&s;h it&s;elf is very far from having. There are few can doubt this after
trying the difference between the fle&s;h of young and old animals. The fir&s;t
is &s;oft and tender, the la&s;t is hard and dry.</P>
<P>The &s;kin is the only part of the body that age does not contribute
to harden. That &s;tretches to every degree of ten&s;ion; and we have horrid
in&s;tances of its pliancy, in many di&s;orders incident to humanity. In youth,
therefore, while the body is vigorous and en|crea&s;ing, it &s;till gives way
to its growth. But, although it thus adapts it&s;elf to our encrea&s;e, it does
not in the &s;ame manner conform to our de|cay. The &s;kin, which in youth was
filled, and glo&s;&s;y, when the body begins to decline, has not ela&s;ticity
enough to &s;hrink entirely with its di|munition. It hangs, therefore, in
wrinkles, which no art can remove. The wrinkles of the body, in general,
proceed from this cau&s;e. But tho&s;e of the face &s;eem to proceed from
another; namely, from the many varieties of po&s;itions into which it is put by
the &s;peech, the food, or the pa&s;&s;ions. Every grimace, and every 
<PB N="198" REF="202"> pa&s;&s;ion wrinkles up the vi&s;age into different
forms. The&s;e are vi&s;ible enough in young per|&s;ons; but what at fir&s;t
was accidental, or tran&s;i|tory, becomes unalterably fixed in the vi&s;age as
it grows older. 
<Q REND="inline">"From hence we may conclude, that a freedom from
pa&s;&s;ions not only adds to the happine&s;s of the mind, but pre&s;erves the
beauty of the face; and the per&s;on that has not felt their influence, is
le&s;s &s;trongly marked by the decays of nature."</Q></P>
<P>Hence, therefore, as we advance in age, the bones, the cartilages,
the membranes, the fle&s;h, the &s;kin, and every fibre of the body, becomes
more &s;olid, more brittle, and more dry. Every part &s;hrinks, every motion
becomes more &s;low; the circulation of the fluids is performed with le&s;s
freedom; per&s;piration dimini&s;hes; the &s;e|cretions alter; the dige&s;tion
becomes &s;low and laborious; and the juices no longer &s;erving to convey
their accu&s;tomed nouri&s;hment, tho&s;e parts may be &s;aid to live no longer
when the circulation cea&s;es. Thus the body dies by little and little; all its
functions are dimini&s;hed by degrees; life is driven from one part of the
frame to another; univer&s;al rigidity prevails; and death at la&s;t &s;eizes
upon the little that is left.</P>
<P>As the bones, the cartilages, the mu&s;cles, <PB N="199" REF="203">
and all other parts of the body, are &s;ofter in women than in men, the&s;e
parts mu&s;t, of con|&s;equence require a longer time to come to that
hardne&s;s which ha&s;tens death. Women, there|fore, ought to be a longer time
in growing old than men; and this is actually the ca&s;e. If we con&s;ult the
tables which have been drawn up re&s;pecting human life, we &s;hall find, that
after a certain age they are more long lived than men, all other
circum&s;tances the &s;ame. A woman of &s;ixty has a better chance than a man
of the &s;ame age to live till eighty. Upon the whole we may infer, that &s;uch
per|&s;ons as have been &s;low in coming up to ma|turity, will al&s;o be &s;low
in growing old; and this holds as well with regard to other animals as to
man.</P>
<P>The whole duration of the life of either ve|getables, or animals,
may be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, determined from their manner of coming to
maturity. The tree, or the animal, which takes but a &s;hort time to encrea&s;e
to its utmo&s;t pitch, peri&s;hes much &s;ooner than &s;uch as are le&s;s
pre|mature. In both, the encrea&s;e upwards is fir&s;t accompli&s;hed; and not
till they have acquired their greate&s;t degree of height do they begin to
&s;pread in bulk. Man grows in &s;tature till about the age of &s;eventeen; but
his body is not com|pletely <PB N="200" REF="204"> developed till about thirty.
Dogs, on the other hand, are at their utmo&s;t &s;ize, in a year, and become as
bulky as they u&s;ually are in another. However, man who is &s;o long in
growing continues to live for four&s;core, or an hundred years; but the dog
&s;eldom above twelve, or thirteen. In general, al&s;o, it may be &s;aid that
large animals live longer than little ones, as they u&s;ually take a larger
time to grow. But in all animals one thing is equally certain, that they carry
the cau&s;es of their own decay about them; and that their deaths are
nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable. The pro&s;pects which &s;ome vi|&s;ionaries have
formed of perpetuating life by remedies, have been often enough proved fal&s;e
by their own example. Such unaccountable &s;chemes would, therefore, have died
with them, had not the love of life always augmented our credulity.</P>
<P>When the body is naturally well formed, it is po&s;&s;ible to
lengthen out the period of life for &s;ome years by management. Temperance in
diet is often found conducive to this end. The famous Cornaro, who lived to
above an hundred years, although his con&s;titution was naturally feeble, is a
&s;trong in&s;tance of the benefit of an ab&s;te|mious life. Moderation in the
pa&s;&s;ions al&s;o may contribute to extend the term of our exi&s;t|ence. 
<PB N="201" REF="205"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Fontenelle, the celebrated writer, was naturally of
a very weak and delicate habit of body. He was affected by the &s;malle&s;t
irre|gularities; and had frequently &s;uffered &s;evere fits of illne&s;s from
the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es. But the remarkable equality of his temper, and his
&s;eeming want of pa&s;&s;ion, lengthened out his life to above an hundred. It
was remarkable of him, that nothing could vex or make him un|ea&s;y; every
occurrence &s;eemed equally plea&s;ing; and no event, however unfortunate,
&s;eemed to come unexpected."</Q> However, the term of life can be prolonged
but for a very little time by any art we can u&s;e. We are told of men who have
lived beyond the ordinary duration of human exi&s;tence; &s;uch as Par, who
lived to an hundred and forty-four; and Jenkins to an hundred and &s;ixty-five;
yet the&s;e men u&s;ed no peculiar arts to prolong life; on the contrary, it
appears that the&s;e, as well as &s;ome others, remarkable for their longevity,
were pea&s;ants accu&s;tomed to the greate&s;t fatigues, who had no &s;ettled
rules of diet, but who often indulged in accidental exce&s;&s;es. Indeed, if we
con&s;ider that the European, the Negroe, the Chine&s;e, and the American, the
civilized man, and the &s;avage, the rich and the poor, the inhabitant of the
city, and of the country, though all &s;o different in other re|&s;pects, 
<PB N="202" REF="206"> are yet entirely &s;imilar in the period al|lotted them
for living; if we con&s;ider that nei|ther the difference of race, of climate,
of nou|ri&s;hment, of convenience, or of &s;oil, makes any difference in the
term of life; if we con&s;ider that tho&s;e men who live upon raw fle&s;h, or
dried fi&s;hes, upon &s;eago, or rice, upon ca&s;&s;ava, or upon roots,
neverthele&s;s live as long as tho&s;e who are fed upon bread and meat, we
&s;hall readily be brought to acknowledge, that the duration of life depends
neither upon habit, cu&s;toms, or the quantity of food; we &s;hall confe&s;s,
that no|thing can change the laws of that mechani&s;m which regulates the
number of our years, and which can chiefly be affected only by long fa&s;t|ing,
or great exce&s;s.</P>
<P>If there be any difference in the different pe|riods of man's
exi&s;tence, it ought principally to be a&s;cribed to the quality of the air.
It has been ob&s;erved, that in elevated &s;ituations there have been found
more old people than in tho&s;e that were low. The mountains of Scotland,
Wales, Auvergne, and Switzerland, have fur|ni&s;hed more in&s;tances of extreme
old age than the plains of Holland, Flanders, Germany, or Poland. But, in
general, the duration of life is nearly the &s;ame in mo&s;t countries. Man, if
not cut off by accidental di&s;ea&s;es, is generally <PB N="203" REF="207">
found to live to ninety or an hundred years. Our ance&s;tors did not live
beyond that date; and, &s;ince the times of David, this term has made but
little alteration.</P>
<P>If we be a&s;ked how in the beginning men lived &s;o much longer
than at pre&s;ent, and by what means their lives were extended to nine hundred
and thirty, or even nine hundred and &s;ixty years, it may be an&s;wered, that
the pro|ductions of the earth, upon which they fed, might be of a different
nature at that time, from what they are at pre&s;ent. 
<Q REND="inline">"It may be an&s;wered, that the term was abridged by
Divine command, in order to keep the earth from being over-&s;tocked with human
inhabitants; &s;ince, if every per&s;on were now to live and ge|nerate for nine
hundred years, mankind would be encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that there
would be no room for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: &s;o that the plan of Providence would
be altered; which is &s;een not to produce life, without providing a proper
&s;upply."</Q></P>
<P>But, to whatever extent life may be pro|longed, or however &s;ome
may have delayed the effects of age, death is the certain goal to which all are
ha&s;tening. All the cau&s;es of decay which have been mentioned, contribute to
bring on this dreaded di&s;&s;olution. However, nature <PB N="204" REF="208">
approaches to this awful period, by &s;low and imperceptible degrees; life is
con&s;uming day after day; and &s;ome one of our faculties, or vital
principles, is every hour dying before the re&s;t; &s;o that death is only the
la&s;t &s;hade in the picture: and it is probable, that man &s;uffers a greater
change in going from youth to age, than from age into the grave. When we
fir&s;t begin to live, our lives may &s;carcely be &s;aid to be our own; as the
child grows, life encrea&s;es in the &s;ame proportion; and is at its height in
the prime of manhood. But as &s;oon as the body begins to decrea&s;e, life
decrea&s;es al&s;o; for, as the human frame dimini&s;hes, and its juices
cir|culate in &s;maller quantity, life dimini&s;hes and circulates with le&s;s
vigour; &s;o that as we begin to live by degrees, we begin to die in the &s;ame
manner.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould we fear death, if our lives have been &s;uch as
not to make eternity dread|ful! Why &s;hould we fear that moment which is
prepared by a thou&s;and other moments of the &s;ame kind! the fir&s;t pangs of
&s;ickne&s;s being probably greater than the la&s;t &s;truggles of de|parture.
Death, in mo&s;t per&s;ons, is as calmly endured as the di&s;order that brings
it on. If we enquire from tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to attend the
&s;ick and the dying, we &s;hall find that, <PB N="205" REF="209"> except in a
very few acute ca&s;es, where the pa|tient dies in agonies, the greate&s;t
number die quietly, and &s;eemingly without pain: and even the agonies of the
former, rather terrify the &s;pectators, than torment the patient; for how many
have we not &s;een who have been acci|dentally relieved from this extremity,
and yet had no memory of what they then endured. In fact, they had cea&s;ed to
live, during that time when they cea&s;ed to have &s;en&s;ation; and their
pains were only tho&s;e of which they had an idea.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t number of mankind die, there|fore, without
&s;en&s;ation; and of tho&s;e few that &s;till pre&s;erve their faculties
entire to the la&s;t moment, there is &s;carce one of them that does not al&s;o
pre&s;erve the hopes of &s;till out-living his di&s;order. Nature, for the
happine&s;s of man, has rendered this &s;entiment &s;tronger than his rea&s;on.
A per&s;on dying of an incurable di&s;|order, which he mu&s;t know to be &s;o,
by fre|quent examples of his ca&s;e; which he perceives to be &s;o, by the
inquietude of all around him, by the tears of his friends, and the departure or
the face of the phy&s;ician, is, neverthele&s;s, &s;till in hopes of getting
over it. His intere&s;t is &s;o great, that he only attends to his own
repre|&s;entations; the judgment of others is con&s;idered 
<PB N="206" REF="210"> as an ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion; and while death every moment
makes new inroads upon his con|&s;titution, and de&s;troys life in &s;ome part,
hope &s;till &s;eems to e&s;cape the univer&s;al ruin, and is the la&s;t that
&s;ubmits to the blow.</P>
<P>Ca&s;t your eyes upon a &s;ick man, who has an hundred times told
you that he felt him&s;elf dying, that he was convinced he could not re|cover,
and that he was ready to expire; ex|amine what pa&s;&s;es on his vi&s;age,
when, through zeal or indi&s;cretion, any one comes to tell him that his end is
at hand. You will &s;ee him change, like one who is told an unexpected piece of
news. He now appears not to have thoroughly believed what he had been telling
you him&s;elf; he doubted much; and his fears were greater than his hopes: but
he &s;till had &s;ome feeble expectations of living, and would not have &s;een
the approaches of death, unle&s;s he had been alarmed by the mi&s;taken
a&s;&s;iduity of his attendants.</P>
<P>Death, therefore, is not that terrible thing which we &s;uppo&s;e it
to be. It is a &s;pectre which frights us at a di&s;tance, but which
di&s;|appears when we come to approach it more clo&s;ely. Our ideas of its
terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dre&s;&s;ed up by fancy; we re|gard it
not only as the greate&s;t misfortune, but <PB N="207" REF="211"> as al&s;o an
evil accompanied with the mo&s;t ex|cruciating tortures: we have even
encrea&s;ed our apprehen&s;ions, by rea&s;oning on the extent of our
&s;ufferings. It mu&s;t be dreadful, &s;ay &s;ome, &s;ince it is &s;ufficient
to &s;eparate the &s;oul from the body; it mu&s;t be long &s;ince our
&s;ufferings are proportioned to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas; and the&s;e
being painful, mu&s;t &s;ucceed each other with extreme rapidity. In this
manner has fal&s;e philo&s;ophy laboured to augment the mi&s;eries of our
nature; and to aggravate that period, which Nature has kindly covered with
in&s;en&s;ibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can &s;uffer the&s;e
calamities; the mind is, at that time, mo&s;tly without ideas; and the body too
much enfeebled, to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain
produces either death, or fainting, which is a &s;tate &s;imilar to death: the
body can &s;uffer but to a certain de|gree; if the torture becomes
exce&s;&s;ive, it de|&s;troys it&s;elf; and the mind cea&s;es to perceive, when
the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P>In this manner, exce&s;&s;ive pain admits of no reflection; and
wherever there are any &s;igns of it, we may be &s;ure that the &s;ufferings of
the patient are no greater than what we our&s;elves may have remembered to
endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many <PB N="208" REF="212">
in&s;tances in which the dying per&s;on has &s;hewn that very reflection that
pre-&s;uppo&s;es an ab&s;ence of the greate&s;t pain; and, con&s;equently, that
pang which ends life, cannot even be &s;o great as tho&s;e which have preceded.
Thus, when Charles XII. was &s;hot at the &s;iege of Frederick- &s;hall, he was
&s;een to clap his hand on the hilt of his &s;word; and although the blow was
great enough to terminate one of the bolde&s;t and brave&s;t lives in the
world, yet it was not painful enough to de&s;troy reflection. He perceived
him|&s;elf attacked; he reflected that he ought to de|fend him&s;elf, and his
body obeyed the impul&s;e of his mind, even in the la&s;t extremity. Thus it is
the prejudice of per&s;ons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us
&s;uffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, con|tracted an
habit of making out exce&s;&s;ive plea|&s;ures and pains; and nothing but
repeated ex|perience &s;hews us, how &s;eldom the one can be &s;uffered, or the
other enjoyed to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>If there be any thing nece&s;&s;ary to confirm what we have &s;aid,
concerning the gradual ce&s;&s;ation of life, or the in&s;en&s;ible approaches
of our end, nothing can more effectually prove it, than the uncertainty of the
&s;igns of death. If we con&s;ult what Win&s;low or Bruhier have &s;aid upon
this &s;ubject, we &s;hall be convinced, that <PB N="209" REF="213"> between
life and death, the &s;hade is &s;o very un|di&s;tingui&s;hable, that even all
the powers of art can &s;carcely determine where the one ends, and the other
begins. The colour of the vi&s;age, the warmth of the body, the &s;upplene&s;s
of the joints, are but uncertain &s;igns of life &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing;
while, on the contrary, the palene&s;s of the complexion, the coldne&s;s of the
body, the &s;tiff|ne&s;s of the extremities, the ce&s;&s;ation of all mo|tion,
and the total in&s;en&s;ibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death
begun. In the &s;ame manner al&s;o, with regard to the pul&s;e, and the
breathing, the&s;e motions are often &s;o kept under, that it is impo&s;&s;ible
to perceive them. By approaching a looking-gla&s;s to the mouth of the per&s;on
&s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, people often expect to find whether he breathes or
not. But this is a very uncertain experiment: the gla&s;s is frequently
&s;ullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the per&s;on is
&s;till alive, although the gla&s;s is no way tarni&s;hed. In the &s;ame
manner, neither burning, nor &s;carifying, neither noi&s;es in the ears, nor
pungent &s;pirits applied to the no&s;trils, give certain &s;igns of the
di&s;continuance of life; and there are many in|&s;tances of per&s;ons who have
endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external 
<PB N="210" REF="214"> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the
&s;pectators. How careful, therefore, &s;hould we be, before we commit tho&s;e
who are deare&s;t to us to the grave, to be well a&s;&s;ured of their
departure: ex|perience, ju&s;tice, humanity, all per&s;uade us not to ha&s;ten
the funerals of our friends, but to keep their bodies unburied, until we have
cer|tain &s;igns of their real decea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Varieties in the Human Race.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have compared man with other animals; we now come to
compare men with each other. We have hitherto con&s;idered him as an
individual, endowed with excellencies above the re&s;t of the creation; we now
come to con&s;ider the advantages which men have over men, and the various
kinds with which our earth is inhabited.</P>
<P>If we compare the minute differences of mankind, there is &s;carce
one nation upon the earth that entirely re&s;embles another; and there may be
&s;aid to be as many different kinds of men as there are countries inhabited.
One po|li&s;hed nation does not differ more from another, than the mere&s;t
&s;avages do from tho&s;e &s;avages that lie even contiguous to them; and it
fre|quently happens that a river, or a mountain, di|vides two barbarous tribes
that are unlike each other in manners, cu&s;toms, features, and com|plexion.
But the&s;e differences, however per|ceivable, do not form &s;uch
di&s;tinctions as come within a general picture of the varieties of man|kind.
Cu&s;tom, accident, or fa&s;hion, may pro|duce <PB N="212" REF="216">
con&s;iderable alterations in neighbouring nations; their being derived from
ance&s;tors of a different climate, or complexion, may contri|bute to make
accidental di&s;tinctions, which every day grow le&s;s; and it may be &s;aid,
that two neighbouring nations, how unlike &s;oever at fir&s;t, will
a&s;&s;imilate by degrees; and, by long continuance, the difference between
them will at la&s;t become almo&s;t imperceptible. It is not, therefore,
between contiguous nations we are to look for any &s;trong marked varieties in
the human &s;pecies; it is by comparing the inha|bitants of oppo&s;ite
climates, and di&s;tant coun|tries; tho&s;e who live within the polar circle
with tho&s;e beneath the equator; tho&s;e that live on one &s;ide of the globe
with tho&s;e that occupy the other.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the differences between man|kind are the
&s;malle&s;t. Of the lower races of creatures, the changes are &s;o great as
often en|tirely to di&s;gui&s;e the natural animal, and to di|&s;tort, or to
disfigure its &s;hape. But the chief differences in man are rather taken from
the tincture of his &s;kin than the variety of his figure; and in all climates
he pre&s;erves his erect de|portment, and the marked &s;uperiority of his form.
If we look round the world there &s;eem to be not above &s;ix di&s;tinct
varieties in the hu|man <PB REF="217">

&s;trongly marked, and &s;peaks the kind &s;eldom to have mixed with any
other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have taken four of the&s;e varieties from
Linnaeus; tho&s;e of the Laplanders and Tartars from Mr. Buffon.</NOTE>. But
there is nothing in the &s;hape, nothing in the faculties, that &s;hews their
coming from different originals; and the varieties of climate, of
nouri&s;hment, and cu&s;tom, are &s;uf|ficient to produce every change.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t di&s;tinct race of men is found round the polar regions.
The Laplanders, the E&s;qui|maux Indians, the Samoeid Tartars, the inha|bitants
of Nova Zembla, the Borandians, the Greenlanders, and the natives of
Kam&s;katka, may be con&s;idered as one peculiar race of people, all greatly
re&s;embling each other in their &s;tature, their complexion, their cu&s;toms,
and their ignorance. The&s;e nations being un|der a rigorous climate, where the
productions of nature are but few, and the provi&s;ions coar&s;e and
unwhole&s;ome, their bodies have &s;hrunk to the nature of their food; and
their complexions have &s;uffered, from cold, almo&s;t a &s;imilar change to
what heat is known to produce; their colour being a deep brown, in &s;ome
places inclining to actual blackne&s;s. The&s;e, therefore, in ge|neral, are
found to be a race of &s;hort &s;tature, and odd &s;hape, with countenances as
&s;avage as <PB REF="219"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="213" REF="220"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="214" REF="221"> their manners are barbarous. The vi&s;age, in the&s;e
countries, is large and broad, the no&s;e flat and &s;hort, the eyes of a
yellowi&s;h brown inclining to blackne&s;s, the eye-lids drawn to|wards the
temples, the cheek-bones extremely high, the mouth very large, the lips thick
and turned outwards, the voice thin and &s;queak|ing, the head large, the hair
black and &s;treight, the colour of the &s;kin of a dark greyi&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>. They are &s;hort in &s;tature, the
generality not being above four feet high, and the talle&s;t not above five.
Among all the&s;e nations the women are as deformed as the men, and re&s;emble
them &s;o nearly that one cannot, at fir&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes among
them.</P>
<P>The&s;e nations not only re&s;emble each other in their deformity,
their dwarfi&s;hne&s;s, the co|lour of their hair and eyes, but they have all,
in a great mea&s;ure, the &s;ame inclinations, and the &s;ame manners, being
all equally rude, &s;u|per&s;titious, and &s;tupid. The Dani&s;h Lap|landers
have a large black cat, to which they communicate all their &s;ecrets, and
con&s;ult in all their affairs. Among the Swedi&s;h Lap|landers there is in
every family a drum for con|&s;ulting the devil; and, although the&s;e nations
are robu&s;t, and nimble, yet they are &s;o cowardly <PB N="215" REF="222">
that they never can be brought into the field. Gu&s;tavus Adolphus attempted to
make a regi|ment of Laplanders, but he found it impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h
his de&s;ign; for it &s;hould &s;eem that they can live only in their own
country, and in their own manner. They make u&s;e of &s;kates, which are made
of fir, of near three feet long, and half a foot broad; the&s;e are pointed,
and rai&s;ed before, and tyed to the foot by &s;traps of leather. With the&s;e
they &s;kate upon the icy &s;now with &s;uch velocity, that they very ea&s;ily
overtake the &s;wifte&s;t animals. They make u&s;e al&s;o of a pole, pointed
with iron at one end, and rounded at the other. This pole &s;erves to pu&s;h
them along, to direct their cour&s;e, to &s;upport them from falling, to &s;top
the im|petuo&s;ity of their motion, and to kill that game which they have
overtaken. Upon the&s;e &s;kates they de&s;cend the &s;teepe&s;t mountains, and
&s;cale the mo&s;t craggy precipices; and, in the&s;e exerci&s;es, the women
are not le&s;s &s;kilful than the men. They have all the u&s;e of the bow and
arrow, which &s;eems to be a con|trivance common to all barbarous nations; and
which, however, at fir&s;t, required no &s;mall &s;kill to invent. They launce
a javelin al&s;o, with great force; and &s;ome &s;ay that they can hit a mark,
no larger than a crown, at thirty yards <PB N="216" REF="223"> di&s;tance, and
with &s;uch force as would pierce a man through. They are all hunters; and
particularly pur&s;ue the ermine, the fox, the ounce, and the martin, for the
&s;ake of their &s;kins. The&s;e they barter, with their &s;outhern neighbours,
for brandy and tobacco; both which they are fond of to exce&s;s. Their food is
principally dried fi&s;h, the fle&s;h of rein-deer and bears. Their bread is
compo&s;ed of the bones of fi&s;hes, pounded and mixed with the in&s;ide tender
bark of the pine tree. Their drink is train-oil, or brandy, and, when de|prived
of the&s;e, water, in which juniper berries have been infu&s;ed. With regard to
their morals, they have all the virtues of &s;implicity, and all the vices of
ignorance. They offer their wives and daughters to &s;trangers; and &s;eem to
think it a particular honour if their offer be accepted. They have no idea of
religion, or a Supreme Being; the greate&s;t number of them are ido|laters; and
their &s;uper&s;tition is as profound as their wor&s;hip is contemptible.
Wretched and ignorant as they are, yet they do not want pride; they &s;et
them&s;elves far above the re&s;t of man|kind; and Krantz a&s;&s;ures us, that
when the Greenlanders are got together, nothing is &s;o cu&s;tomary among them
as to turn the Euro|peans into ridicule. They are obliged, indeed, 
<PB N="217" REF="224"> to yield them the pre-eminence in under&s;tand|ing, and
mechanic arts; but they do not know how to &s;et any value upon the&s;e. They
there|fore count them&s;elves the only civilized and well-bred people in the
world; and it is com|mon with them, when they &s;ee a quiet, or a mode&s;t
&s;tranger, to &s;ay that he is almo&s;t as well bred as a Greenlander.</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription, therefore, this whole race of people may be
con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from any other. Their long continuance in a climate
the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable, their being obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on food the
mo&s;t coar&s;e and ill prepared, the &s;avagene&s;s of their manners, and
their laborious lives, all have contri|buted to &s;horten their &s;tature, and
to deform their bodies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ellis's Voyage, p.
256.</BIBL></NOTE>. In proportion as we approach to|wards the north pole, the
&s;ize of the natives appears to dimini&s;h, growing le&s;s and le&s;s as we
advance higher, till we come to tho&s;e la|titudes that are de&s;titute of all
inhabitants what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>The wretched natives of the&s;e climates &s;eem fitted by nature to
endure the rigours of their &s;ituation. As their food is but &s;canty and
precarious, their patience in hunger is amaz|ing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz. p. 134, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. A man, who has ate
nothing for four days, can manage his little canoe, in the mo&s;t 
<PB N="218" REF="225"> furious waves, and calmly &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the mid&s;t
of a tempe&s;t, that would quickly da&s;h an Eu|ropean boat to pieces. Their
&s;trength is not le&s;s amazing than their patience; a woman among them will
carry a piece of timber, or a &s;tone, near double the weight of what an
European can lift. Their bodies are of a dark grey all over; and their faces
brown, or olive. The tincture of their &s;kins partly &s;eems to ari&s;e from
their dirty manner of living, being generally daubed with train-oil; and partly
from the rigours of climate, as the &s;udden alterations of cold and raw air in
winter, and of burning heats in &s;ummer, &s;hade their com|plexions by
degrees, till, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ge|nerations, they at la&s;t become
almo&s;t black. As the countries in which the&s;e re&s;ide are the mo&s;t
barren, &s;o the natives &s;eem the mo&s;t bar|barous of any part of the earth.
Their more &s;outhern neighbours of America, treat them with the &s;ame &s;corn
that a poli&s;hed nation would treat a &s;avage one; and we may readily judge
of the rudene&s;s of tho&s;e manners, which even a native of Canada can think
more barbarous than his own.</P>
<P>But the gradations of nature are imper|ceptible; and, while the
north is peopled with &s;uch mi&s;erable inhabitants, there are here and there
to be found, upon the edges of the&s;e <PB N="219" REF="226"> regions, people
of larger &s;tature, and completer figure. A whole race of the dwarfi&s;h breed
is often found to come down from the north, and &s;ettle more to the
&s;outhward; and, on the contrary, it &s;ometimes happens that &s;outhern
nations are &s;een higher up, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e diminutive tribes,
where they have continued for time immemorial. Thus the O&s;tiac Tartars &s;eem
to be a race that have travelled down from the north, and to be originally
&s;prung from the minute &s;avages we have been de&s;cribing. There are al&s;o
Norwegians, and Finlanders, of proper &s;tature, who are &s;een to inhabit in
latitudes higher even than Lapland. The&s;e, however, are but accidental
migrations, and &s;erve as &s;hades to unite the di&s;tinct varieties of
man|kind.</P>
<P>The &s;econd great variety, in the human &s;pe|cies, &s;eems to be
that of the Tartar race; from whence, probably, the little men we have been
de&s;cribing originally proceeded. The Tartar country, taken in general,
comprehends the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia; and is, con&s;equently, a general
name given to a number of nations, of various forms and complexions. But,
however they &s;eem to differ from each other, they all agree in being very
unlike the people of any other country what&s;oever. All the&s;e nations 
<PB N="220" REF="227"> have the upper part of the vi&s;age very broad, and
wrinkled even while yet in their youth. Their no&s;es are &s;hort and flat,
their eyes little and &s;unk in their heads; and, in &s;ome of them, they are
&s;een five or &s;ix inches a&s;under. Their cheek-bones are high, the lower
part of their vi&s;age narrow, the chin long and advanced forward, their teeth
of an enormous &s;ize and growing &s;eparate from each other, their eye-brows
thick and large and covering their eyes, their eye-lids thick, the face broad
and flat, the complexion olive coloured, and the hair black. They are of a
middle &s;ize, extremely &s;trong, and very robu&s;t. They have but little
beard, which grows &s;traglingly on the chin. They have large thighs, and
&s;hort legs. The uglie&s;t of all are the Calmoucks, in who&s;e ap|pearance
there &s;eems to be &s;omething frightful. They all lead an erratic life,
remaining under tents of hair, or &s;kins. They live upon hor&s;e fle&s;h and
that of camels, either raw or a little &s;odden between the hor&s;e and the
&s;addle. They eat al&s;o fi&s;h dried in the &s;un. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual drink
is mares milk fermented with mil|let ground into meal. They all have the head
&s;haven, except a lock of hair, on the top, which they let grow &s;ufficiently
long to form into tre&s;&s;es, on each &s;ide of the face. The <PB REF="228">

</FIGURE> <PB N="221" REF="229"> women, who are as ugly as the men,
wear their hair, which they bind up with bits of copper and other ornaments of
a like nature. The ma|jority of the&s;e nations have no religion, no &s;ettled
notions of morality, no decency of be|haviour. They are chiefly robbers: and
the natives of Dage&s;tan, who live near their more poli&s;hed neighbours, make
a traffic of Tartar &s;laves who have been &s;tolen, and &s;ell them to the
Turks and the Per&s;ians. Their chief riches con&s;i&s;t in hor&s;es, of which
perhaps there are more in Tartary, than in any other part of the world. The
natives are taught by cu&s;tom to live in the &s;ame place with their hor&s;es;
they are continually employed in managing them, and at la&s;t bring them to
&s;uch great obedience, that the hor&s;e &s;eems actually to under&s;tand the
rider's intention.</P>
<P>To this race of men al&s;o, we mu&s;t refer the Chine&s;e and the
Japane&s;e, however different they &s;eem in their manners and ceremonies. It
is the form of the body that we are now principally con|&s;idering; and there
is, between the&s;e countries, a &s;urprizing re&s;emblance. It is in general
al|lowed that the Chine&s;e have broad faces, &s;mall eyes, flat no&s;es, and
&s;carce any beard; that they are broad and &s;quare &s;houldered, and rather
le&s;s in &s;tature than Europeans. The&s;e are marks <PB REF="230">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="221" REF="231">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="222" REF="232"> common
to them and the Tartars, and they may, therefore, be con&s;idered as being
derived from the &s;ame original. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have ob&s;erved," &s;ays Chardin, "that in all
the people from the ea&s;t and the north of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, to the
penin&s;ula of Malacca, that the lines of the face, and the formation of the
vi&s;age, is the &s;ame. This has induced me to believe, that all the&s;e
nations are derived from the &s;ame ori|ginal, however different either their
complex|ions or their manners may appear: for as to the complexion, that
proceeds entirely from the climate and the food; and as to the manners, the&s;e
are generally the re&s;ult of their different degrees of wealth or power."</Q>
That they come from one &s;tock, is evident al&s;o, from this; that the Tartars
who &s;ettle in China, quickly re|&s;emble the Chine&s;e; and, on the contrary,
the Chine&s;e who &s;ettle in Tartary, &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the figure, and the
manners, of the Tartars.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e &s;o much re&s;emble the Chine&s;e, that one cannot
he&s;itate to rank them in the &s;ame cla&s;s. They only differ in being rather
browner, as they inhabit a more &s;outhern cli|mate. They are, in general,
de&s;cribed, as of a brown complexion, a &s;hort &s;tature, a broad flat face,
a very little beard, and black hair. Their cu&s;toms and ceremonies are nearly
the &s;ame; <PB N="223" REF="233"> their ideas of beauty &s;imilar; and their
artificial deformities of blackening the teeth, and ban|daging the feet,
entirely alike in both countries. They both, therefore, proceed from the &s;ame
&s;tock; and although they differ very much from their brutal progenitors, yet
they owe their civilization wholly to the mildne&s;s of the climate in which
they re&s;ide, and to the peculiar fertility of the &s;oil. To this tribe
al&s;o, we may refer the Cochin Chine&s;e, the Siame&s;e, the Ton|quine&s;e,
and the inhabitants of Aracan, Laos, and Pegu, who, though all differing from
the Chine&s;e, and each other, neverthele&s;s, have too &s;trong a
re&s;emblance, not to betray their com|mon original.</P>
<P>Another, which makes the third variety in the human &s;pecies, is
that of the &s;outhern A&s;iatics; the form of who&s;e features and per&s;ons
may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the Tartar races. The nations
that inhabit the pe|nin&s;ula of India, &s;eem to be the principal &s;tock from
whence the inhabitants of the i&s;lands that lie &s;cattered in the Indian
ocean, have been peopled. They are, in general, of a &s;lender &s;hape, with
long &s;trait black hair, and often with Roman no&s;es. Thus they re&s;emble
the Europeans in &s;tature and features; but greatly differ in colour and habit
of body. The Indians <PB N="224" REF="234"> are of an olive colour, and, in the
more &s;outhern parts, quite black; although the word Mogul, in their language,
&s;ignifies a white man. The women are extremely delicate, and bathe very
often: they are of an olive colour, as well as the men; their legs and thighs
are long, and their bodies &s;hort, which is the oppo&s;ite to what is &s;een
among the women of Europe. They are, as I am a&s;&s;ured, by no means &s;o
fruitful as the European women; but they feel the pains of child-birth with
much le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, and are generally up and well the day following.
In fact, the&s;e pains &s;eem greate&s;t in all countries where the women are
mo&s;t delicate, or the con|&s;titution enfeebled by luxury or indolence. The
women of &s;avage nations &s;eem, in a great mea|&s;ure, exempt from painful
labours; and even the hard working wives of the pea&s;ants among our&s;elves,
have this advantage, from a life of indu&s;try, that their child bearing is
le&s;s painful. Over all India, the children arrive &s;ooner at maturity, than
with us of Europe. They often marry, and con&s;ummate, the hu&s;band at ten
years old, and the wife at eight; and they fre|quently have children at that
age. However, the women who are mothers &s;o &s;oon, cea&s;e bear|ing before
they are arrived at thirty; and, at that time, they appear wrinkled, and &s;eem
<PB N="225" REF="235"> marked with all the deformities of age. The Indians have
long been remarkable for their cowardice and effeminacy; every conqueror that
has but attempted the inva&s;ion of their country, having &s;ucceeded. The
warmth of the climate entirely influences their manners; they are &s;lothful,
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and luxurious: &s;atisfied with &s;en&s;ual happine&s;s alone,
they find no plea|&s;ure in thinking; and contented with &s;lavery, they are
ready to obey any ma&s;ter. Many tribes among them eat nothing that has life;
they are fearful of killing the meane&s;t in&s;ect; and have even erected
ho&s;pitals for the main|tenance of all kinds of vermin. The A&s;iatic dre&s;s
al&s;o, is a loo&s;e flowing garment, rather fitted for the purpo&s;es of peace
and indolence, than of indu&s;try or war. The vigour of the A&s;iatics is
therefore in general conformable to their dre&s;s and nouri&s;hment: fed upon
rice, and cloathed in effeminate &s;ilk ve&s;tments, their &s;oldiers are
unable to oppo&s;e the on&s;et of an European army; and, from the times of
Alex|ander to the pre&s;ent day we have &s;carce any in&s;tances of their
&s;ucce&s;s in arms. Upon the whole, therefore, they may be con&s;idered as a
feeble race of &s;en&s;uali&s;ts, too dull to find rap|ture in any plea&s;ures,
and too indolent to turn their gravity into wi&s;dom. To this cla&s;s we may 
<PB N="226" REF="236"> refer the Per&s;ians and Arabians, and, in general, the
inhabitants of the i&s;lands that lie &s;cattered in the Indian ocean.</P>
<P>The fourth &s;triking variety in the human &s;pecies, is to be found
among the Negroes of Africa. This gloomy race of mankind is found to blacken
all the &s;outhern parts of Africa, from eighteen degrees north of the line, to
its extreme termination, at the Cape of Good Hope. I know it is &s;aid, that
the Caffres, who inhabit the &s;outhern extremity of that large continent, are
not to be ranked among the Negroe race; however, the difference between them,
in point of colour and features, is &s;o &s;mall, that they may very ea&s;ily
be grouped in this general picture; and in the one or two that I have &s;een, I
could perceive not the &s;malle&s;t difference. Each of the Negroe nations, it
mu&s;t be owned, differ among each other; they have their peculiar countries
for beauty, like us; and different nations, as in Europe, pride them&s;elves
upon the regularity of their features. Tho&s;e of Guinea, for in&s;tance, are
extremely ugly, and have an-in&s;upportable &s;cent; tho&s;e of Mo&s;am|bique,
are reckoned beautiful, and have no ill &s;mell what&s;oever. The Negroes, in
general, are of a black colour, with a &s;mooth &s;oft &s;kin. This
&s;moothne&s;s proceeds from the downy &s;oft|ne&s;s <PB REF="237">

feel, in tho&s;e of a white complexion. Their &s;kins, therefore, have a velvet
&s;moothne&s;s, and &s;eem le&s;s braced upon the mu&s;cles than ours. The hair
of their heads differs entirely from what we are accu&s;tomed to, being &s;oft,
woolly, and &s;hort. The beard al&s;o, partakes of the &s;ame qualities: but in
this it differs, that it &s;oon turns grey, which the hair is &s;eldom found to
do; &s;o that &s;everal are &s;een with white beards, and black hair, at the
&s;ame time. Their eyes are generally of a deep hazle; their no&s;es flat and
&s;hort; their lips thick and tumid; and their teeth of an ivory whitene&s;s.
This their only beauty, however, is &s;et off by the colour of their &s;kin;
the contra&s;t between the black and white being the more ob&s;ervable. It is
fal&s;e to &s;ay that their features are deformed by art; &s;ince, in the

<P>The inhabitants of America make a fifth race, as different from all
the re&s;t in colour, as they are di&s;tinct in habitation. The natives of
America (except in the northern extremity, where they re&s;emble the

hair, and thin black beards; which, however, they take care to pluck out by the
roots. They have, in general, flat no&s;es, with high cheek bones, and &s;mall
eyes; and the&s;e deformities of nature they endeavour to encrea&s;e by art:
they flatten the no&s;e, and often the whole head of their children, while the
bones are yet &s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion. They paint the body and
face of various colours, and con&s;ider the hair upon any part of it, except
the head, as a deformity which they are careful to eradicate. Their limbs are
generally &s;lighter made than tho&s;e of the Europeans; and I am a&s;&s;ured,

in the field, but fall upon them at an advantage; and the greatne&s;s of their
fears &s;erves to encrea&s;e the rigours of their cruelty. The wants which they
often &s;u&s;tain, makes them &s;urprizingly patient in adver&s;ity;
di&s;tre&s;s, by being grown familiar, becomes le&s;s terrible; &s;o that their
patience is le&s;s the re&s;ult of for|titude than of cu&s;tom. They have all a
&s;erious air, although they &s;eldom think; and, how|ever cruel to their
enemies, are kind and ju&s;t to each other. In &s;hort, the cu&s;toms of
&s;avage nations in every country are almo&s;t the &s;ame; a wild, independent,
and precarious life, pro|duces a peculiar train of virtues and vices: and
patience and ho&s;pitality, indolence and rapa|city, content and &s;incerity,
are found not le&s;s among the natives of America, than all the barbarous
nations of the globe.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t variety of the human &s;pecies, is that of
the Europeans, and the nations bordering on them. In this cla&s;s we may reckon
the Georgians, Circa&s;&s;ians, and Mingre|lians, the inhabitants of A&s;ia
Minor, and the northern parts of Africa, together with a part of tho&s;e
countries which lie north-we&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. The inhabitants of
the&s;e countries differ a good deal from each other; but they generally agree
in the colour of their bodies, <PB N="231" REF="247"> the beauty of their
complexions, the largene&s;s of their limbs, and the vigour of their
under|&s;tandings. Tho&s;e arts which might have had their invention among the
other races of man|kind, have come to perfection there. In bar|barous
countries, the inhabitants go either naked, or are awkwardly cloathed in furs
or feathers; in countries &s;emi-barbarous, the robes are loo&s;e and flowing;
but here the cloathing is le&s;s made for &s;hew than expedition, and unites,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, the extremes of or|nament and di&s;patch.</P>
<P>To one or other of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, we may re|fer the people of
every country; and as each nation has been le&s;s vi&s;ited by &s;trangers, or
has had le&s;s commerce with the re&s;t of mankind, we find their per&s;ons,
and their manners, more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with one or other of the
cha|racters mentioned above. On the contrary, in tho&s;e places where trade has
long flouri&s;hed, or where enemies have made many incur&s;ions, the races are
u&s;ually found blended, and pro|perly fall beneath no one character. Thus, in
the i&s;lands of the Indian ocean, where a trade has been carried on for time
immemorial, the inhabitants appear to be a mixture of all the nations upon the
earth; white, olive, brown, and black men, are all &s;een living together in 
<PB N="232" REF="248"> the &s;ame city, and propagate a mixed breed, that can
be referred to none of the cla&s;&s;es into which naturali&s;ts have thought
proper to divide mankind.</P>
<P>Of all the colours by which mankind is di|ver&s;ified, it is ea&s;y
to perceive, that ours is not only the mo&s;t beautiful to the eye, but the
mo&s;t advantageous. The fair com|plexion &s;eems, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it,
as a tran&s;parent covering to the &s;oul; all the varia|tions of the
pa&s;&s;ions, every expre&s;&s;ion of joy or &s;orrow, flows to the cheek, and,
without language, marks the mind. In the &s;lighte&s;t change of health al&s;o,
the colour of the Eu|ropean face is the mo&s;t exact index, and often teaches
us to prevent tho&s;e di&s;orders that we do not as yet perceive: not but that
the African black, and the A&s;iatic olive complexions, admit of their
alterations al&s;o; but the&s;e are neither &s;o di&s;tinct, nor &s;o
vi&s;ible, as with us; and, in &s;ome countries, the colour of the vi&s;age is
never found to change; but the face continues in the &s;ame &s;ettled &s;hade
in &s;hame, and in &s;ickne&s;s, in anger, and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The colour, therefore, mo&s;t natural to man, ought to be that which
is mo&s;t becoming; and it is found, that, in all regions, the children are
born fair, or at lea&s;t red, and that they grow more black, or tawny, as they
advance in age. <PB N="233" REF="249"> It &s;hould &s;eem, con&s;equently, that
man is na|turally white; &s;ince the &s;ame cau&s;es that darken the complexion
in infants, may have originally operated, in &s;lower degrees, in blackening
whole nations. We could, therefore, readily account for the blackne&s;s of
different nations, did we not &s;ee the Americans, who live under the line, as
well as the natives of Negroland, of a red colour, and but a very &s;mall
&s;hade darker than the natives of the northern lati|tudes, in the &s;ame
continent. For this rea&s;on, &s;ome have &s;ought for other cau&s;es of
blackne&s;s than the climate; and have endeavoured to prove that the blacks are
a race of people, bred from one man, who was marked with acciden|tal
blackne&s;s. This, however, is but mere un|grounded conjecture; and, although
the Ame|ricans are not &s;o dark as the Negroes, yet we mu&s;t &s;till continue
in the ancient opinion, that the deepne&s;s of the colour proceeds from the
exce&s;&s;ive heat of the climate. For, if we com|pare the heats of Africa with
tho&s;e of America, we &s;hall find they bear no proportion to each other. In
America, all that part of the conti|nent which lies under the line, is cool and
plea|&s;ant, either &s;haded by mountains, or refre&s;hed by breezes from the
&s;ea. But, in Africa, the wide tract of country that lies under the line is
very <PB N="232" REF="250"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="233" REF="251"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="234" REF="252"> exten&s;ive, and the &s;oil &s;andy; the reflexion of
the &s;un, therefore, from &s;o large a &s;urface of earth, is almo&s;t
intolerable; and it is not to be wondered at, that the inhabitants &s;hould
bear, in their looks, the marks of the inho&s;pitable climate. In America, the
country is but thinly inhabited; and the more torrid tracts are gene|rally left
de&s;ert by the inhabitants; for which rea&s;on they are not &s;o deeply tinged
by the beams of the &s;un. But in Africa the whole face of the country is fully
peopled; and the natives are obliged to endure their &s;ituation, without a
power of migration. It is there, con&s;equently, that they are in a manner tied
down to feel all the &s;everity of the heat; and their complexions take the
darke&s;t hue they are capable of receiving. We need not, there|fore, have
recour&s;e to any imaginary propaga|tion, from per&s;ons accidentally black,
&s;ince the climate is a cau&s;e obvious, and &s;ufficient to produce the
effect.</P>
<P>In fact if we examine the complexions of dif|ferent countries, we
&s;hall find them darken in proportion to the heat of their climate; and the
&s;hades gradually to deepen as they approach the line. Some nations, indeed,
may be found not &s;o much tinged by the &s;un as others, although they lie
nearer the line. But this ever proceeds <PB N="235" REF="253"> from &s;ome
accidental cau&s;es; either from the country lying higher, and con&s;equently
being colder; or from the natives bathing oftener, and leading a more civilized
life. In gene|ral, it may be a&s;&s;erted, that, as we approach the line, we
find the inhabitants of each country grow browner, until the colour deepens
into perfect blackne&s;s. Thus taking our &s;tandard from the white&s;t race of
people, and beginning with our own country, which, I believe, bids faire&s;t
for the pre-eminence, we &s;hall find the French, who are more &s;outhern, a
&s;light &s;hade deeper than we; going farther down, the Spaniards are browner
than the French; the in|habitants of Fez darker than they; and the na|tives of
Negroeland the darke&s;t of all. In what manner the &s;un produces this effect,
and how the &s;ame luminary which whitens wax and linen, &s;hould darken the
human complexion, is not ea&s;y to conceive. Sir Thomas Brown fir&s;t
&s;uppo&s;ed that a mucous &s;ub&s;tance, which had &s;omething of a vitriolic
quality, &s;ettled under the reticular membrane, and grew darker with heat.
Others have &s;uppo&s;ed that the blackne&s;s lay in the epi|dermis, or &s;carf
&s;kin, which was burnt up like leather. But nothing has been &s;atisfactorily
di&s;covered upon the &s;ubject; it is &s;ufficient that we are a&s;&s;ured of
the fact; and that we have no <PB N="236" REF="254"> doubt of the &s;un's
tinging the complexion in proportion to its vicinity.</P>
<P>But we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;un is the only cau&s;e of
darkening the &s;kin; the wind, extreme cold, hard labour, or coar&s;e and
&s;par|ing nouri&s;hment, are all found to contribute to this effect. We find
the pea&s;ants of every country, who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the weather, a
&s;hade darker than the higher ranks of people. The &s;avage inhabitants of all
places are expo&s;ed &s;till more, and, therefore, contract a &s;till deeper
hue; and this will account for the tawny colour of the North American Indians.
Although they live in a climate the &s;ame, or even more northerly than ours,
yet they are found to be of complexions very different from tho&s;e of Europe.
But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that they live continually expo&s;ed to the
&s;un; that they u&s;e many methods to darken their &s;kins by art, painting
them with red oker, and anointing them with the fat of bears. Had they taken,
for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal generations, the &s;ame precautions to
brighten their colour that an Eu|ropean does, it is very probable that they
would in time come to have &s;imilar com|plexions; and, perhaps, di&s;pute the
prize of beauty.</P>
<P>The extremity of cold is not le&s;s productive <PB N="237" REF="255"> of a tawny complexion than that of heat. The natives of the artic
circle, as was ob&s;erved, are all brown; and tho&s;e that lie mo&s;t to the
north are almo&s;t entirely black. In this manner both extremes are
unfavourable to the human form and colour, and the &s;ame effects are produced
under the poles that are found at the line.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;tature of different coun|tries, that &s;eems
chiefly to re&s;ult from the na|ture of the food, and the quantity of the
&s;up|ply. Not but that the &s;everity of heat or cold, may, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, dimini&s;h the growth, and produce a dwarfi&s;hne&s;s of make. But,
in general, the food is the great agent in produc|ing this effect; where that
is &s;upplied in large quantities, and, where its quality is whole&s;ome and
nutrimental, the inhabitants are generally &s;een above the ordinary &s;tature.
On the con|trary, where it is afforded in a &s;paring q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ty, or very coar&s;e, and void of nouri&s;hment in its
kind, the inhabitants degenerate, and &s;ink be|low the ordinary &s;ize of
mankind. In this re|&s;pect they re&s;emble other animals, who&s;e bo|dies, by
proper feeding, may be greatly aug|mented. An ox, on the fertile plains of
India, grows to a &s;ize four times as large as the dimi|nutive animal of the
&s;ame kind bred in the <PB N="238" REF="256"> Alps. The hor&s;es bred in the
plains are larger than tho&s;e of the mountain. So it is with man; the
inhabitants of the valley are u&s;ually found taller than tho&s;e of the hill:
the natives of the Highlands of Scotland, for in&s;tance, are &s;hort, broad,
and hardy; tho&s;e of the Lowlands are tall and &s;hapely. The inhabitants of
Green|land, who live upon dried fi&s;h and &s;eals, are le&s;s than tho&s;e of
Gambia or Senegal, where Nature &s;upplies them with vegetable and ani|mal
abundance.</P>
<P>The form of the face &s;eems rather to be the re&s;ult of cu&s;tom.
Nations who have long con|&s;idered &s;ome artificial deformity as beautiful,
who have indu&s;triou&s;ly le&s;&s;ened the feet, or flattened the no&s;e, by
degrees, begin to receive the im|pre&s;&s;ion they are taught to a&s;&s;ume;
and Nature, in a cour&s;e of ages, &s;hapes it&s;elf to the con|&s;traint, and
a&s;&s;umes hereditary deformity. We find nothing more common in births than
for children to inherit &s;ometimes even the accidental deformities of their
parents. We have many in&s;tances of &s;quinting in the father, which he
received from fright, or habit, communicated to the offspring; and I my&s;elf
have &s;een a child di&s;tinctly marked with a &s;car, &s;imilar to one the
father had received in battle. In this man|ner <PB N="239" REF="257">
accidental deformities may become natural ones; and by a&s;&s;iduity may be
continued, and even encrea&s;ed, through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. From
this, therefore, may have ari&s;en the &s;mall eyes and long ears of the
Tartars, and Chine&s;e nations. From hence originally may have come the flat
no&s;es of the blacks, and the flat heads of the American Indians.</P>
<P>In this &s;light &s;urvey, therefore, I think we may &s;ee that all
the variations in the human figure, as far as they differ from our own, are
produced either by the rigour of the climate, the bad quality, or the
&s;cantine&s;s of the pro|vi&s;ions, or by the &s;avage cu&s;toms of the
country. They are actual marks of the degeneracy in the human form; and we may
con&s;ider the Eu|ropean figure and colour as &s;tandards to which to refer all
other varieties, and with which to compare them. In proportion as the Tartar or
American approaches nearer to European beauty, we con&s;ider the race as le&s;s
degenerated; in pro|portion as he differs more widely, he has made greater
deviations from his original form.</P>
<P>That we have all &s;prung from one common parent, we are taught,
both by rea&s;on and re|ligion, to believe; and we have good rea&s;on al&s;o to
think that the Europeans re&s;emble him <PB N="240" REF="258"> more than any of
the re&s;t of his children. How|ever, it mu&s;t not be concealed that the olive
coloured A&s;iatic, and even the jet black Ne|groe, claim this honour of
hereditary re&s;em|blance; and a&s;&s;ert that white men are mere de|viations
from original perfection. Odd as this opinion may &s;eem, they have got
Linnaeus, the celebrated naturali&s;t, on their &s;ide; who &s;up|po&s;es man a
native of the tropical climates, and only a &s;ojourner more to the north. But,
not to enter into a controver&s;y upon a matter of a very remote &s;peculation,
I think one argument alone will &s;uffice to prove the contrary, and &s;hew
that the white man is the original &s;ource from whence the other varieties
have &s;prung. We have frequently &s;een white children pro|duced from black
parents, but have never &s;een a black offspring the production of two whites.
From hence we may conclude that whitene&s;s is the colour to which mankind
naturally tends; for, as in the tulip, the parent &s;tock is known by all the
artificial varieties breaking into it; &s;o in man, that colour mu&s;t be
original which never alters, and to which all the re&s;t are acciden|tally
&s;een to change. I have &s;een in London, at different times, two white
Negroes, the i&s;&s;ue of black parents, that &s;erved to convince me of 
<PB N="241" REF="259"> the truth of this theory. I had before been taught to
believe that the whitene&s;s of the Negroe &s;kin was a di&s;ea&s;e, a kind of
milky whitene&s;s, that might be called rather a leprous cru&s;t than a
na|tural complexion. I was taught to &s;uppo&s;e that the numberle&s;s white
Negroes, found in va|rious parts of Africa, the white men that go by the name
of Chacrelas, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and the white Americans, near the I&s;thmus
of Da|rien, in the We&s;t Indies, were all as &s;o many di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons,
and even more deformed than the blacke&s;t of the natives. But, upon ex|amining
that Negroe which was la&s;t &s;hewn in London, I found the colour to be
exactly like that of an European; the vi&s;age white and ruddy, and the lips of
the proper redne&s;s. However, there were &s;ufficient marks to con|vince me of
its de&s;cent. The hair was white and woolly, and very unlike any thing I had
&s;een before. The iris of the eye was yellow, inclining to red; the no&s;e was
flat, exactly re|&s;embling that of a Negroe; and the lips thick, and
prominent. No doubt, therefore, re|mained of the child's having been born of
Ne|groe parents; and the per&s;on who &s;hewed it had atte&s;tations to
convince the mo&s;t incredu|lous. From this then we &s;ee that the variations 
<PB N="242" REF="260"> of the Negroe colour is into whitene&s;s, whereas the
white are never found to have a race of Ne|groe children. Upon the whole,
therefore, all tho&s;e changes which the African, the A&s;iatic, or the
American undergo, are but accidental defor|mities, which a kinder climate,
better nou|ri&s;hment, or more civilized manners, would, in a cour&s;e of
centuries, very probably, re|move.</P>

another kind, which are only found in the individual; and, being more rarely

infinite; and, perhaps, their u&s;e is as much circum&s;cribed as their variety
is exten&s;ive.</NOTE>. It is &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve, that every day's
experience mu&s;t have &s;hewn us mi&s;erable in&s;tances of this kind,
produced by nature, or affectation; calamities that no pity can &s;often, nor
a&s;&s;iduity relieve.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over, therefore, every other account, 
<PB N="245" REF="263"> I &s;hall only mention the famous in&s;tance, quoted by
Father Malbranche; upon which he founds his beautiful theory of mon&s;trous
pro|ductions. A woman of Paris, the wife of a trade&s;man, went to &s;ee a
criminal broke alive upon the wheel, at the place of public execu|tion. She was
at that time two months ad|vanced in her pregnancy, and no way &s;ubject to any
di&s;orders to affect the child in her womb. She was, however, of a tender
habit of body; and, though led by curio&s;ity to this horrid &s;pectacle, very
ea&s;ily moved to pity and compa&s;&s;ion. She felt, therefore, all tho&s;e
&s;trong emotions which &s;o terrible a &s;ight mu&s;t naturally in&s;pire;
&s;hud|dered at every blow the criminal received, and almo&s;t &s;wooned at his
cries. Upon returning from this &s;cene of blood, &s;he continued for &s;ome
days pen&s;ive, and her imagination &s;till wrought upon the &s;pectacle &s;he
had lately &s;een. After &s;ome time, however, &s;he &s;eemed perfectly
re|covered from her fright, and had almo&s;t for|gotten her former
unea&s;ine&s;s. When the time of her delivery approached, &s;he &s;eemed no
ways mindful of her former terrors, nor were her pains in labour more than
u&s;ual in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances. But, what was the amazement of her friends,
and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, when the child came into the world! It was found that
every <PB N="246" REF="264"> limb in its body was broken ju&s;t like tho&s;e of
the malefactor, and ju&s;t in the &s;ame place. This poor infant, that had
&s;uffered the pains of life, even before its coming into the world, did not
die, but lived in an ho&s;pital, in Paris, for twenty years after, a wretched
in|&s;tance of the &s;uppo&s;ed power of imagination in the mother of altering
and di&s;torting the infant in the womb. The manner in which Mal|branche
rea&s;ons upon this fact, is as follows. The Creator has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch
a &s;ympathy between the &s;everal parts of nature, that we are led not only to
imitate each other, but al&s;o to partake in the &s;ame affections and
de&s;ires. The animal &s;pirits are thus carried to the re|&s;pective parts of
the body, to perform the &s;ame actions which we &s;ee others perform, to
receive in &s;ome mea&s;ure their wounds, and take part in their &s;ufferings.
Experience tells us, that if we look attentively on any per&s;on &s;everely
beaten, or &s;orely wounded, the &s;pirits imme|diately flow into tho&s;e parts
of the body which corre&s;pond to tho&s;e we &s;ee in pain. The more delicate
the con&s;titution, the more it is thus af|fected; the &s;pirits making a
&s;tronger impre&s;|&s;ion on the fibres of a weakly habit than of a robu&s;t
one. Strong vigorous men &s;ee an exe|cution without much concern, while women
of <PB N="247" REF="265"> nicer texture are &s;truck with horror and con|cern.
This &s;en&s;ibility in them mu&s;t, of con|&s;equence, be communicated to all
parts of their body; and, as the fibres of the child, in the womb, are
incomparably finer than tho&s;e of the mother, the cour&s;e of the animal
&s;pirits mu&s;t, con&s;equently, produce greater altera|tions. Hence, every
&s;troke given to the cri|minal, forcibly &s;truck the imagination of the
woman; and, by a kind of counter &s;troke, the delicate tender frame of the
child.</P>
<P>Such is the rea&s;oning of an ingenious man, upon a fact, the
veracity of which many &s;ince have called in que&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. 4, p. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>. They have allowed,
indeed, that &s;uch a child might have been produced, but have denied the
cau&s;e of its de|formity. How could the imagination of the mother, &s;ay they,
produce &s;uch dreadful ef|fects upon her child? She has no communica|tion with
the infant; &s;he &s;carce touches it in any part; quite unaffected with her
concerns, it &s;leeps in &s;ecurity, in a manner &s;ecluded by a fluid in which
it &s;wims, from her that bears it. With what a variety of deformities, &s;ay
they, would all mankind be marked, if all the vain and capricious de&s;ires of
the mother were thus readily written upon the body of the child? 
<PB N="248" REF="266"> Yet, notwith&s;tanding this plau&s;ible way of
rea&s;oning, I cannot avoid &s;till giving &s;ome credit to the variety of
in&s;tances I have either read, or &s;een, upon this &s;ubject. If it be a
prejudice, it is as old as the days of Ari&s;totle, and to this day as
&s;trongly believed, by the ge|nerality of mankind, as ever. It does not ad|mit
of a rea&s;on; and, indeed, I can give none even why the child &s;hould, in any
re&s;pect, re|&s;emble the father, or the mother. The fact we generally find to
be &s;o. But why it &s;hould take the particular print of the father's features
in the womb, is as hard to conceive, as why it &s;hould be affected by the
mother's imagination. We all know what a &s;trong effect the imagi|nation has
on tho&s;e parts in particular, without being able to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e how
this effect is produced; and why the imagination may not produce the &s;ame
effect in marking the child that it does in forming it, I &s;ee no rea&s;on.
Tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e employment it is to rear up pidgeons of different
colours, can breed them, as their expre&s;&s;ion is, to a feather. In fact, by
properly paring them, they can give what colour they will to any feather, in
any part of the body. Were we to rea&s;on upon this fact, what could we &s;ay?
Might it not be a&s;&s;erted, that the egg, being di&s;tinct from the body of 
<PB N="249" REF="267"> the female, cannot be influenced by it? Might it not be
plau&s;ibly &s;aid, that there is no &s;imili|tude between any part of the egg
and any par|ticular feather, which we expect to propagate? and yet, for all
this, the fact is known to be true, and what no &s;peculation can invalidate.
In the &s;ame manner, a thou&s;and various in|&s;tances a&s;&s;ure us that the
child, in the womb, is &s;ometimes marked by the &s;trong affections of the
mother; how this is performed we know not; we only &s;ee the effect, without
any connexion between it and the cau&s;e. The be&s;t phy&s;icians have allowed
it; and have been &s;a|tisfied to &s;ubmit to the experience of a number of
ages; but many di&s;believe it, becau&s;e they expect a rea&s;on for every
effect. This, however, is very hard to be given, while it is very ea&s;y to
appear wi&s;e by pretending incredulity.</P>
<P>Among the number of mon&s;ters, dwarfs and giants are u&s;ually
reckoned; though not, per|haps, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, &s;ince they
are no way different from the re&s;t of mankind, except in &s;tature. It is a
di&s;pute, however, about words; and, therefore, &s;carce worth con|tending
about. But there is a di&s;pute, of a more curious nature, on this &s;ubject;
namely, whe|ther there are races of people thus very dimi|nutive, or va&s;tly
large, or whether they be <PB N="250" REF="268"> merely accidental varieties,
that now and then are &s;een in a country, in a few per&s;ons, who&s;e bodies
&s;ome external cau&s;e has contributed to le&s;&s;en, or enlarge.</P>
<P>With regard to men of diminutive &s;tature, all antiquity has been
unanimous in a&s;&s;erting their national exi&s;tence. Homer was the fir&s;t
who has given us an account of the pigmy na|tion, contending with the cranes;
and what po|etical licence might be &s;uppo&s;ed to exaggerate, Athenaeus has
attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to confirm by hi&s;torical a&s;&s;ertion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Athenaeus. ix. 390.</BIBL></NOTE>. If we attend to the&s;e,
we mu&s;t believe that in the internal parts of Africa, there are whole nations
of pigmy be|ings, not more than a foot in &s;tature, who continually wage an
unequal war with the birds and bea&s;ts that inhabit the plains in which they
re&s;ide. Some of the ancients, however, and Strabo in particular, have
&s;uppo&s;ed all the&s;e accounts to be fabulous; and have been more inclined
to think this &s;uppo&s;ed nation of pig|mies, nothing more than a &s;pecies of
apes, well known to be numerous in that part of the world. With this opinion
the moderns have all con|curred; and that diminutive race, which was
de&s;cribed as human, has been long degraded into a cla&s;s of animals that
re&s;emble us but very imperfectly.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="269">The exi&s;tence, therefore, of a pigmy race of
mankind, being founded in error, or in fable, we can expect to find men of
diminutive &s;tature only by accident, among men of the ordinary &s;ize. Of
the&s;e accidental dwarfs, every country, and almo&s;t every village, can
produce numerous in&s;tances. There was a time, when the&s;e un|favoured
children of Nature, were the peculiar favourites of the great; and no prince,
or no|bleman, thought him&s;elf completely attended, unle&s;s he had a dwarf
among the number of his dome&s;tics. The&s;e poor little men were kept to be
laughed at; or to rai&s;e the barbarous plea&s;ure of their ma&s;ters, by their
contra&s;ted inferiority. Even in England, as late as the times of king James
the Fir&s;t, the court was at one time fur|ni&s;hed with a dwarf, a giant, and
a je&s;ter: the&s;e the king often took a plea&s;ure in oppo&s;ing to each
other, and often fomented quarrels among them, in order to be a concealed
&s;pectator of their animo&s;ity. It was a particular entertainment of the
courtiers at that time, to &s;ee little Jeffery, for &s;o the dwarf was called,
ride round the li&s;ts, expecting his antagoni&s;t; and di&s;covering, in his
actions, all the marks of contemptible re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>It was in the &s;ame &s;pirit, that Peter of Ru&s;&s;ia, in the year
1710, celebrated a marriage of <PB N="252" REF="270"> dwarfs. This monarch,
though rai&s;ed by his native genius far above a barbarian, was,
never|thele&s;s, &s;till many degrees removed from actual refinement. His
plea&s;ures, therefore, were of the vulgar kind; and this was among the
num|ber. Upon a certain day, which he had ordered to be proclaimed &s;everal
months before, he in|vited the whole body of his courtiers, and all the foreign
amba&s;&s;adors, to be pre&s;ent at the marriage of a pigmy man and woman. The
preparations for this wedding were not only very grand, but executed in a
&s;tyle of barbarous ridi|cule. He ordered, that all the dwarf men and women,
within two hundred miles, &s;hould re|pair to the capital; and al&s;o
in&s;i&s;ted, that they &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the ceremony. For this
purpo&s;e, he &s;upplied them with proper vehicles; but &s;o contrived it, that
one hor&s;e was &s;een car|rying in a dozen of them into the city at once,
while the mob followed &s;houting, and laughing, from behind. Some of them were
at fir&s;t unwil|ling to obey an order, which they knew was cal|culated to turn
them into ridicule, and did not come; but he &s;oon obliged them to obey; and,
as a puni&s;hment, enjoined, that they &s;hould wait upon the re&s;t at dinner.
The whole company of dwarfs amounted to &s;eventy, be&s;ide the bride and
bridegroom, who were richly adorned, and <PB N="253" REF="271"> in the
extremity of the fa&s;hion. For this little company in miniature, every thing
was &s;uitably provided; a low table, &s;mall plates, little gla&s;&s;es, and,
in &s;hort, every thing was &s;o fitted, as if all things had been dwindled to
their own &s;tandard. It was his great plea&s;ure to &s;ee their gravity and
their pride; the contention of the women for places, and the men for
&s;uperiority. This point he attempted to adju&s;t, by ordering, that the
mo&s;t diminutive &s;hould take the lead; but this bred di&s;putes, for none
would then con&s;ent to &s;it foremo&s;t. All this, however, being at la&s;t
&s;ettled, dancing followed the din|ner, and the ball was opened with a minuet
by the bridegroom, who mea&s;ured exactly three feet two inches high. In the
end, matters were &s;o contrived, that this little company, who met together in
gloomy pride, and unwilling to be plea&s;ed, being at la&s;t familiarized to
laughter, joined in the diver&s;ion, and became, as the journali&s;t has
it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Die dench wurdige. Iwerg. Hock&s;heit, &amp;c.
Lip&s;iae, 1713. vol. viii. page 102. &s;eq.</BIBL></NOTE>, extremely
&s;prightly and en|tertaining.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the entertainment &s;uch gue&s;ts might afford,
when united, I never found a dwarf capable of affording any when alone. I have
&s;ometimes conver&s;ed with &s;ome of the&s;e <PB N="254" REF="272"> that were
exhibited at our fairs about town, and have ever found their intellects as
con|tracted as their per&s;ons. They, in general, &s;eemed to me to have
faculties very much re|&s;embling tho&s;e of children, and their de&s;ires
&s;eemed of the &s;ame kind; being diverted with the &s;ame &s;ports, and
be&s;t plea&s;ed with &s;uch companions. Of all tho&s;e I have &s;een, which
may amount to five or &s;ix, the little man, who&s;e name was Coan, that died
lately at Chel&s;ea, was the mo&s;t intelligent and &s;prightly. I have heard
him and the giant, who &s;ung at the theatres, &s;u&s;tain a very ridiculous
duet, to which they were taught to give great &s;pirit. But this mirth, and
&s;eeming &s;agacity, were but a&s;&s;umed. He had, by long habit, been taught
to look chearful upon the approach of com|pany; and his conver&s;ation was but
the mere etiquette of a per&s;on that had been u&s;ed to re|ceive vi&s;itors.
When driven out of his walk, nothing could be more &s;tupid or ignorant,
no|thing more dejected or forlorn. But, we have a compleat hi&s;tory of a
dwarf, very accurately related by Mr. Danbenton, in his part of the Hi&s;toire
Naturel; which I will here take leave to tran&s;late.</P>
<P>This dwarf, who&s;e name was Baby, was well known, having &s;pent
the greate&s;t part of his life <PB N="255" REF="273"> at Lunenville, in the
palace of Stani&s;laus, the exiled king of Poland. He was born in the village
of Plai&s;ne, in France, in the year 1741. His father and mother were
pea&s;ants, both of good con&s;titutions, and inured to a life of hu&s;|bandry
and labour. Baby, when born, weighed but a pound and a quarter. We are not
informed of the dimen&s;ions of his body at that time; but we may conjecture
they were very &s;mall, as he was pre&s;ented on a plate to be baptized, and
for a long time lay in a &s;lipper. His mouth, although proportioned to the
re&s;t of his body, was not, at that time, large enough to take in the nipple;
and he was, therefore, obliged to be &s;uckled by a &s;he-goat that was in the
hou&s;e; and that &s;erved as a nur&s;e, attending to his cries with a kind of
maternal fondne&s;s. He began to articulate &s;ome words when eighteen months
old; and at two years he was able to walk alone. He was then fitted with
&s;hoes that were about an inch and a half long. He was attacked with &s;everal
acute di&s;orders; but the &s;mall-pox was the only one which left any marks
behind it. Until he was &s;ix years old, he eat no other food but pul&s;e,
potatoes, and bacon. His father and mother were, from their po|verty, incapable
of affording him any better nouri&s;hment; and his education was little better 
<PB N="256" REF="274"> than his food, being bred up among the ru&s;tics of the
place. At &s;ix years old he was about fifteen inches high; and his whole body
weigh|ed but thirteen pound. Notwith&s;tanding this, he was well proportioned,
and hand&s;ome; his health was good, but his under&s;tanding &s;carce
pa&s;&s;ed the bounds of in&s;tinct. It was at that time that the king of
Poland, having heard of &s;uch a curio&s;ity, had him conveyed to Lunen|ville,
gave him the name of Baby, and kept him in his palace.</P>
<P>Baby, having thus quitted the hard condition of a pea&s;ant to enjoy
all the comforts and the conveniencies of life, &s;eemed to receive no
al|teration from his new way of living, either in mind or per&s;on. He
pre&s;erved the good|ne&s;s of his con&s;titution till about the age of
&s;ixteeen, but his body &s;eemed to encrea&s;e very &s;lowly during the whole
time; and his &s;tupi|dity was &s;uch, that all in&s;tructions were lo&s;t in
improving his under&s;tanding. He could never be brought to have any &s;en&s;e
of religion, nor even to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;igns of a rea&s;oning fa|culty.
They attempted to teach him dancing and mu&s;ic, but in vain; he never could
make any thing of mu&s;ic; and as for dancing, altho' he beat time tolerably
exact, yet he could never remember the figure, but while his dancing-ma&s;ter 
<PB N="257" REF="275"> &s;tood by to direct his motions. Not|with&s;tanding a
mind thus de&s;titute of under|&s;tanding, was not without its pa&s;&s;ions,
anger and jealou&s;y harra&s;&s;ed it at times; nor was he without de&s;ires of
another nature.</P>
<P>At the age of &s;ixteen, Baby was twenty-nine inches tall; at this
he re&s;ted; but having thus arrived at his acme, the alterations of puberty,
or rather, perhaps, of old age, came fa&s;t upon him. From being very
beautiful, the poor little creature now became quite de|formed; his &s;trength
quite for&s;ook him; his back bone began to bend; his head hung for|ward; his
legs grew weak; one of his &s;houl|ders turned awry; and his no&s;e grew
di&s;pro|portionably large. With his &s;trength, his na|tural &s;pirits al&s;o
for&s;ook him; and, by the time he was twenty, he was grown feeble, decrepid,
and marked with the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of old age. It had been
before remarked by &s;ome, that he would die of old age before he arrived at
thirty; and, in fact, by the time he was twenty-two, he could &s;carcely walk
an hundred paces, being worn with the multi|plicity of his years, and bent
under the burthen of protracted life. In this year he died; a cold, attended
with a &s;light fever, threw him into a kind of lethargy, which had a few
mo|mentary <PB N="258" REF="276"> intervals; but he could &s;carce be brought
to &s;peak. However, it is a&s;&s;erted, that in the five la&s;t days of his
life, he &s;hewed a clearer under&s;tanding, than in his times of be&s;t
health: but at length he died, after enduring great agonies, in the
twenty-&s;econd year of his age.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this accidental diminution of the human race, is that
of its extraordinary mag|nitude. Concerning the reality of a nation of Giants,
there have been many di&s;putes among the learned. Some have affirmed the
proba|bility of &s;uch a race; and others, as warmly have denied the
po&s;&s;ibility of their exi&s;tence. But it is not from any &s;peculative
rea&s;onings, upon a &s;ubject of this kind, that information is to be
obtained; it is not from the di&s;putes of the &s;cholar, but the labours of
the enterprizing, that we are to be in&s;tructed in this enquiry. Indeed,
nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than what &s;ome learned men have advanced upon
this &s;ubject. It is very unlikely, &s;ays Grew, that there &s;hould either be
dwarfs or giants; or if &s;uch, they cannot be fitted for the u&s;ual
enjoy|ment of life and rea&s;on. Had man been born a dwarf, he could &s;carce
have been a rea&s;onable creature; for to that end, he mu&s;t have a jolt head,
and then he would not have body and blood enough to &s;upply his brain with
&s;pirits: <PB N="259" REF="277"> or if he had a &s;mall head, proportionable
to his body, there would not be brain enough for con|ducting life. But it is
&s;till wor&s;e with giants; and there could never have been a nation of
&s;uch, for there would not be food enough found in any country to &s;u&s;tain
them; or if there were bea&s;ts &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, there would
not be gra&s;s enough for their main|tenance. But what is &s;till more, add
others, giants could never be able to &s;upport the weight of their own bodies;
&s;ince a man of ten feet high, mu&s;t be eight times as heavy as one of the
ordinary &s;tature; whereas, he has but twice the &s;ize of mu&s;cles to
&s;upport &s;uch a burthen: and, con&s;equently, would be overloaded with the
weight of his own body. Such are the the|ories upon this &s;ubject; and they
require no other an&s;wer, but that experience proves them both to be fal&s;e:
dwarfs are found capable of life and rea&s;on; and giants are &s;een to carry
their own bodies. We have &s;everal accounts from mariners, that a nation of
giants actually exi&s;ts; and mere &s;peculation &s;hould never in|duce us to
doubt their veracity.</P>
<P>Ferdinand Magellan was the fir&s;t who di&s;|covered this race of
people along the coa&s;t, towards the extremity of South America. Ma|gellan was
a Portugue&s;e, of noble extraction, <PB N="260" REF="278"> who having long
behaved with great bravery, under Albukerk, the conqueror of India, he was
treated with neglect by the court, upon his re|turn. Applying, therefore, to
the king of Spain, he was entru&s;ted with the command of five &s;hips, to take
and &s;ubdue the Molucca i&s;lands; upon one of which he was &s;lain. It was in
his voyage thither, that he happened to winter in St. Julian's Bay, an American
har|bour, forty-nine degrees &s;outh of the line. In this de&s;olate region,
where nothing was &s;een but objects of terror, where neither trees nor
ver|dure dre&s;t the face of the country, they re|mained for &s;ome months
without &s;eeing any human creature. They had judged the country to be utterly
uninhabitable; when one day, they &s;aw approaching, as if he had been dropt
from the clouds, a man of enormous &s;tature, dancing and &s;inging, and
putting du&s;t upon his head, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, in token of peace. This
overture for friend&s;hip was, by Magellan's command, quickly an&s;wered by the
re&s;t of his men; and the giant approaching, te&s;tified every mark of
a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;urprize. He was &s;o tall, that the Spaniards only
reached his wai&s;t; his face was broad, his colour brown, and painted over
with a variety of tints; each cheek had the re&s;emblance of an heart drawn
upon it; <PB N="261" REF="279"> his hair was approaching to whitene&s;s; he was
cloathed in &s;kins, and armed with a bow. Being treated with kindne&s;s, and
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents, he &s;oon returned, with many
more of the &s;ame &s;tature; two of whom the mariners decoyed on &s;hip-board:
nothing could be more gentle than they were in the beginning; they con&s;idered
the fetters that were preparing for them, as ornaments, and played with them,
like children with their toys; but when they found for what purpo&s;e they were
intended, they in&s;tantly exerted their amazing &s;trength, and broke them in
pieces with a very ea&s;y effort. This account, with a variety of other
circum&s;tances, has been confirmed by &s;ucceed|ing travellers: Herrera,
Sebald Wert, Oliver Van Noort, and James le Maire, all corre&s;pond in
affirming the fact, although they differ in many particulars of their
re&s;pective de&s;criptions. The la&s;t voyager we have had, that has &s;een
this enormous race, is Commodore Byron. I have talked with the per&s;on who
fir&s;t gave the relation of that voyage, and who was the car|penter of the
Commodore's &s;hip; he was a &s;en|&s;ible, under&s;tanding man, and I believe
ex|tremely faithful. By him, therefore, I was a&s;&s;ured, in the mo&s;t
&s;olemn manner, of the truth of his relation; and this account has &s;ince
been <PB N="262" REF="280"> confirmed by one or two publications; in all which,
the particulars are pretty nearly the &s;ame. One of the circum&s;tances which
mo&s;t puzzled me to reconcile to probability, was that of the hor&s;es, on
which they are de&s;cribed as riding down to the &s;hore. We know the American
hor&s;e to be of European breed; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be degenerated
from the original. I was at a lo&s;s, therefore, to account how an hor&s;e of
not more than fourteen hands high, was capable of carrying a man of nine feet;
or, in other words, an animal almo&s;t as large as it&s;elf. But the wonder
will cea&s;e, when we con&s;ider, that &s;o &s;mall a bea&s;t as an a&s;s, will
carry a man of ordinary &s;ize tolerably well; and the proportion between this,
and the former in&s;tance, is tolerably exact. We can no longer, therefore,
refu&s;e our a&s;&s;ent to the exi&s;t|ence of this gigantic race of mankind;
in what manner they are propagated, or under what re|gulations they live, is a
&s;ubject that remains for future inve&s;tigation. It &s;hould appear,
how|ever, that they are a wandering nation, changing their abode with the
cour&s;e of the &s;un, and &s;hifting their &s;ituation, for the convenience of
food, climate, or pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>This race of giants are de&s;cribed as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of great
&s;trength; and, no doubt, they <PB N="263" REF="281"> mu&s;t be very different
from tho&s;e accidental giants that are to be &s;een in different parts of
Europe. Stature with the&s;e, &s;eems rather their infirmity than their pride;
and adds to their burthen, without encrea&s;ing their &s;trength. Of tho&s;e I
have &s;een, the generality were ill-formed and unhealthful; weak in their
per&s;ons, or in|capable of exerting what &s;trength they were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The &s;ame defects of under&s;tanding that attended
tho&s;e of &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;tature, were found in tho&s;e who were thus
overgrown: they were heavy, phlegmatic, &s;tupid, and inclined to &s;adne&s;s.
Their numbers, however, are but few; and it is thus kindly ordered by
Providence, that as the middle &s;tate is the be&s;t fitted for happine&s;s,
&s;o the middle ranks of mankind are produced in the greate&s;t variety.</P>
<P>However, mankind &s;eems naturally to have a re&s;pect for men of
extraordinary &s;tature; and it has been a &s;uppo&s;ition of long &s;tanding,
that our ance&s;tors were much taller, as well as much more beautiful than we.
This has been, in|deed, a theme of poetical declamation from the beginning; and
man was &s;carce formed, when he began to deplore an imaginary decay. Nothing
is more natural than this progre&s;s of the mind, in looking up to antiquity
with reve|rential wonder. Having been accu&s;tomed to <PB N="264" REF="282">
compare the wi&s;dom of our fathers, with our own in early imbecillity, the
impre&s;&s;ion of their &s;uperiority remains when they no longer exi&s;t, and
when we cea&s;e to be inferior. Thus the men of every age con&s;ider the pa&s;t
as wi&s;er than the pre&s;ent; and the reverence &s;eems to accu|mulate as our
imaginations a&s;cend. For this rea|&s;on, we allow remote antiquity many
advantages, without di&s;puting their title: the inhabitants of uncivilized
countries repre&s;ent them as taller and &s;tronger; and the people of a more
poli&s;hed nation, as more healthy and more wi&s;e. Ne|verthele&s;s, the&s;e
attributes &s;eem to be only the prejudices of ingenuous minds; a kind of
gra|titude, which we hope in turn to receive from po&s;terity. The ordinary
&s;tature of men, Mr. Derham ob&s;erves, is, in all probability, the &s;ame now
as at the beginning. The olde&s;t mea&s;ure we have of the human figure, is in
the monument of Cheops, in the fir&s;t pyramid of Egypt. This mu&s;t have
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted many hundred years before the times of Homer, who is the
fir&s;t that deplores the decay. This mo|nument, however, &s;carce exceeds the
mea&s;ure of our ordinary coffins: the cavity is no more than &s;ix feet long,
two feet wide, and deep in about the &s;ame proportion. Several mummies al&s;o,
of a very early age, are found to be only of the <PB N="265" REF="283">
ordinary &s;tature; and &s;hew that, for the&s;e three thou&s;and years at
lea&s;t, men have not &s;uffered the lea&s;t diminution. We have many
corrobo|rating proofs of this, in the ancient pieces of armour which are dug up
in different parts of Europe. The bra&s;s helmet dug up at Medauro, fits one of
our men, and yet is allowed to have been left there at the overthrow of
A&s;drubal. Some of our fine&s;t antique &s;tatues, which we learn from Pliny,
and others, to be exactly as big as the life, &s;till continue to this day,
remain|ing monuments of the &s;uperior excellence of their workmen indeed, but
not of the &s;upe|riority of their &s;tature. We may conclude, therefore, that
men have been, in all ages, pretty much of the &s;ame &s;ize they are at
pre&s;ent; and that the only difference mu&s;t have been accidental, or perhaps
national.</P>
<P>As to the &s;uperior beauty of our ance&s;tors, it is not ea&s;y to
make the compari&s;on; beauty &s;eems a very uncertain charm; and frequently is
le&s;s in the object, than in the eye of the be|holder. Were a modern lady's
face formed exactly like the Venus of Medicis, or the &s;leeping ve&s;tal,
&s;he would &s;carce be con&s;idered beautiful, except by the lovers of
antiquity, whom, of all her admirers, perhaps, &s;he would 
<PB N="266" REF="284"> be lea&s;t de&s;irous of plea&s;ing. It is true, that we
have &s;ome di&s;orders among us that disfigure the features, and from which
the ancients were exempt; but it is equally &s;o, that we want &s;ome which
were common among them, and which were equally deforming. As for their
intellectual powers, the&s;e al&s;o were probably the &s;ame as ours: we excel
them in the &s;ciences, which may be con&s;idered as an hi&s;tory of
ac|cumulated experience; and they excel us in the poetic arts, as they had the
fir&s;t rifling of all the &s;triking images of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of Mummies, Wax-Works, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter I have, in a great mea&s;ure,
tran&s;lated from Mr. Daubenton. Whatever is added from others, is marked with
inverted commas.</NOTE> is not content with the u&s;ual term of life, but he is
willing to lengthen out his ex|i&s;tence by art; and although he cannot prevent
death, he tries to obviate his di&s;&s;olution. It is natural to attempt to
pre&s;erve even the mo&s;t trifling relicks of what has long given us
plea|&s;ure; nor does the mind &s;eparate from the body, without a wi&s;h, that
even the wretched heap of du&s;t it leaves behind, may yet be re|membered. The
embalming, practi&s;ed in va|rious nations, probably had its ri&s;e in this
fond de&s;ire: an urn filled with a&s;hes, among the Ro|mans, &s;erved as a
pledge of continuing af|fection; and even the gra&s;&s;y graves in our own
church yards, are rai&s;ed above the &s;urface, with the de&s;ire that the body
below &s;hould not be wholly forgotten. The &s;oul, ardent after eter|nity for
it&s;elf, is willing to procure, even for the body, a prolonged
duration."</Q></P>
<P>But of all nations, the Egyptians carried this art to the highe&s;t
perfection: as it was a prin|ciple <PB N="268" REF="286"> of their religion, to
&s;uppo&s;e the &s;oul con|tinued only coeval to the duration of the body, they
tried every art to extend the life of the one, by preventing the
di&s;&s;olution of the other. In this practice they were exerci&s;ed from the
earlie&s;t ages; and the mummies they have em|balmed in this manner, continue
in great num|bers to the pre&s;ent day. We are told, in Ge|ne&s;is, that
Jo&s;eph &s;eeing his father expire, gave orders to his phy&s;icians to embalm
the body, which they executed in the compa&s;s of forty days, which was the
u&s;ual time of embalming. Herodotus al&s;o, the mo&s;t ancient of the
pro|phane hi&s;torians, gives us a copious detail of this art, as it was
practi&s;ed, in his time, among the Egyptians. There are certain men among
them, &s;ays he, who practi&s;e embalming as a trade; which they perform with
all expedition po&s;&s;ible. In the fir&s;t place, they draw out the brain
through the no&s;trils, with irons adapted to this purpo&s;e; and in proportion
as they eva|cuate it in this manner, they fill up the cavity with aromatics:
they next cut open the belly, near the &s;ides, with a &s;harpened &s;tone, and
take out the entrails, which they clean&s;e, and wa&s;h in palm oil: having
performed this operation, they roll them in aromatic powder, fill them with
myrrh, ca&s;&s;ia, and other perfumes, except <PB N="269" REF="287"> incen&s;e;
and replace them, &s;ewing up the body again. After the&s;e precautions, they
&s;alt the body with nitre, and keep it in the &s;alting-place for &s;eventy
days, it not being permitted to pre|&s;erve it &s;o any longer. When the
&s;eventy days are accompli&s;hed, and the body wa&s;hed once more, they
&s;wathe it in bands made of linen, which have been dipt in a gum the Egyptians
u&s;e in&s;tead of &s;alt. When the friends have taken back the body, they make
an hollow trough, &s;omething like the &s;hape of a man, in which they place
the body; and this they in|clo&s;e in a box, pre&s;erving the whole as a mo&s;t
precious relick, placed again&s;t the wall. Such are the ceremonies u&s;ed with
regard to the rich; as for tho&s;e who are contented with an humbler
preparation, they treat them as follows: they fill a &s;yringe with an
odoriferous liquor ex|tracted from the cedar tree, and, without mak|ing any
inci&s;ion, inject it up the body of the decea&s;ed, and then keep it in nitre,
as long as in the former ca&s;e. When the time is expired, they evacuate the
body of the cedar liquor which had been injected; and &s;uch is the effect of
this operation, that the liquor di&s;&s;olves the inte&s;tines, and brings them
away: the nitre al&s;o, &s;erves to eat away the fle&s;h; and leaves only the
&s;kin and the bones remaining. This <PB N="270" REF="288"> done, the body is
returned to the friends, and the embalmer takes no farther trouble about it.
The third method of embalming tho&s;e of the meane&s;t condition, is merely by
purging and clean&s;ing the inte&s;tines by frequent in|jections, and
pre&s;erving the body for a &s;imilar term in nitre, at the end of which it is
re&s;tored to the relations.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus al&s;o, makes mention of the manner in which
the&s;e embalmings are per|formed. According to him, there were &s;everal
officers appointed for this purpo&s;e: the fir&s;t of them, who was called the
&s;cribe, marked tho&s;e parts of the body, on the left &s;ide, which were to
be opened; the cutter made the inci&s;ion; and one of tho&s;e that were to
&s;alt it, drew out all the bowels, except the heart and the kidnies; another
wa&s;hed them in palm-wine, and odo|riferous liquors; afterwards, they anointed
for above thirty days, with cedar, gum, myrrh, cinnamon, and other perfumes.
The&s;e aro|matics pre&s;erved the body entire for a long time, and gave it a
very agreeable odour. It was not in the lea&s;t disfigured by this
pre|paration; after which it was returned to the relations, who kept it in a
coffin, plac'd up|right again&s;t the wall.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the modern writers who have treated <PB N="271" REF="289">
on this &s;ubject, have merely repeated what has been &s;aid by Herodotus; and
if they add any thing of their own, it is but merely from con|jecture. Dumont
ob&s;erves, that it is very pro|bable, that aloes, bitumen, and cinnamon, make
a principal part of the compo&s;ition which is u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion: he
adds, that after embalming, the body is put into a coffin, made of the
&s;ycamore-tree, which is almo&s;t in|corruptible. Mr. Grew remarks, that in an
Egyptian mummy, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Royal Society, the preparation
was &s;o pene|trating, as to enter into the very &s;ub&s;tance of the bones,
and rendered them &s;o black, that they &s;eemed to have been burnt. From this
he is induced to believe, that the Egyptians had a cu&s;tom of embalming their
dead, by boil|ing them in a kind of liquid preparation, until all the aqueous
parts of the body were exhaled away; and until the oily or gummy matter had
penetrated throughout. He propo&s;es, in con|&s;equence of this, a method of
macerating, and afterwards of boiling the dead body in oil of walnut.</P>
<P>I am, for my own part, of opinion, that there were &s;everal ways of
pre&s;erving dead bodies from putrefaction; and that this would be no difficult
matter, &s;ince different nations have all <PB N="272" REF="290"> &s;ucceeded
in the attempt. We have an ex|ample of this kind among the Guanches, the
ancient inhabitants of the i&s;land of Teneriff. Tho&s;e who &s;urvived the
general de&s;truction of this people, by the Spaniards, when they con|quered
this i&s;land, informed them, that the art of embalming was &s;till pre&s;erved
there; and that there was a tribe of prie&s;ts among them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
the &s;ecret, which they kept con|cealed as a &s;acred my&s;tery. As the
greate&s;t part of the nation was de&s;troyed, the Spaniards could not arrive
at a complete knowledge of this art; they only found out a few of the
par|ticulars. Having taken out the bowels, they wa&s;hed the body &s;everal
times in a lee, made of the dried bark of the pine-tree, warmed, during the
&s;ummer, by the &s;un, or by a &s;tove in the winter. They afterwards anointed
it with but|ter, or the fat of bears, which they had pre|viou&s;ly boiled with
odoriferous herbs, &s;uch as &s;age and lavender. After this unction, they
&s;uffered the body to dry; and then repeated the operation, as often as it was
nece&s;&s;ary, until the whole &s;ub&s;tance was impregnated with the
pre|paration. When it was become very light, it was then a certain &s;ign that
it was fit, and pro|perly prepared. They then rolled it up in the dried &s;kins
of goats; which, when they had a <PB N="273" REF="291"> mind to &s;ave expence,
they &s;uffered to remain with the hair &s;till growing upon them. Pur|chas
a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een mummies of this kind in London; and mentions
the name of a gentleman who had &s;een &s;everal of them in the i&s;land of
Teneriff, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been two thou&s;and years old; but
without any certain proofs of &s;uch great anti|quity. This people, who
probably came fir&s;t from the coa&s;ts of Africa, might have learned this art
from the Egyptians, as there was a traffic carried on from thence into the
mo&s;t in|ternal parts of Africa.</P>
<P>Father Aco&s;ta, and Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega, make no doubt but
that the Peruvians under|&s;tood the art of pre&s;erving their dead for a very
long &s;pace of time. They a&s;&s;ert their having &s;een the bodies of
&s;everal Incas, that were per|fectly pre&s;erved. They &s;till pre&s;erved
their hair, and their eye-brows; but they had eyes, made of gold, put in the
places of tho&s;e taken out. They were cloathed in their u&s;ual habits, and
&s;eated in the manner of the Indians, their arms placed on their brea&s;ts.
Garcila&s;&s;o touched one of their fingers, and found it ap|parently as hard
as wood; and the whole body was not heavy enough to over-burthen a weak man,
who &s;hould attempt to carry it away. <PB N="274" REF="292"> Aco&s;ta
pre&s;umes, that the&s;e bodies were em|balmed with a bitumen, of which the
Indians knew the properties. Garcila&s;&s;o, however, is of a different
opinion, as he &s;aw nothing bitu|minous about them; but he confe&s;&s;es, that
he did not examine them very particularly; and he regrets his not having
enquired into the methods u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. He adds that, being a
Peruvian, his countrymen would not have &s;crupled to inform him of the
&s;ecret, if they really had it &s;till among them.</P>
<P>Garcila&s;&s;o, thus being ignorant of the &s;ecret, makes u&s;e of
&s;ome inductions, to throw light upon the &s;ubject; he a&s;&s;erts, that the
air is &s;o dry and &s;o cold at Cu&s;co, that fle&s;h dries there like wood,
without corrupting: and he is of opinion, that they dried the body in &s;now,
be|fore they applied the bitumen: he adds, that in the times of the Incas, they
u&s;ually dried the fle&s;h which was de&s;igned for the ammunition of the
army; and that when they had lo&s;t their humidity, they might be kept without
&s;alt, or any other preparation.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that at Spit&s;bergen, which lies within the artic
circle, and, con&s;equently, in the colde&s;t climate, bodies never corrupt,
nor &s;uffer any apparent alteration, even though buried for thirty years:
nothing corrupts or putrifies <PB N="275" REF="293"> in that climate; the wood
which has been em|ployed in building tho&s;e hou&s;es where the train-oil is
&s;eparated, appears as fre&s;h as the day they were fir&s;t cut.</P>
<P>If exce&s;&s;ive cold, therefore, be thus ca|pable of pre&s;erving
bodies from corruption, it is not le&s;s certain, that a great degree of
dry|ne&s;s, produced by heat, produces the &s;ame effect. It is well known,
that the men and animals that are buried in the &s;ands of Arabia, quickly dry
up, and continue in pre&s;ervation for &s;everal ages, as if they had been
actually em|balmed. It has often happened, that whole caravans have peri&s;hed
in cro&s;&s;ing tho&s;e de&s;erts, either by the burning winds that infe&s;t
them, or by the &s;ands which are rai&s;ed by the tempe&s;t, and overwhelm
every creature in certain ruin. The bodies of tho&s;e per&s;ons are pre&s;erved
en|tire; and they are often found in this condition by &s;ome accidental
pa&s;&s;enger. Many authors, both ancient and modern, make mention of &s;uch
mummies as the&s;e; and Shaw &s;ays, that he has been a&s;&s;ured, that numbers
of men, as well as other animals, have been thus pre&s;erved, for times
immemorial, in the burning &s;ands of Saibah, which is a place, he
&s;uppo&s;es, &s;ituate between Ra&s;em and Egypt.</P>
<P>The corruption of dead bodies, being en|tirely <PB N="276" REF="294"> cau&s;ed by the fermentation of the hu|mours, whatever is capable of
hindering or re|tarding this fermentation, will contribute to their
pre&s;ervation. Both heat and cold, though &s;o contrary in them&s;elves,
produce &s;imilar ef|fects in this particular, by drying up the hu|mours. The
cold in conden&s;ing and thickening them, and the heat in evaporating them
be|fore they have time to act upon the &s;olids. But it is nece&s;&s;ary that
the&s;e extremes &s;hould be con&s;tant; for if they &s;ucceed each other &s;o
as that cold &s;hall follow heat, or dryne&s;s humi|dity, it mu&s;t then
nece&s;&s;arily happen, that cor|ruption mu&s;t en&s;ue. However, in temperate
climates, there are natural cau&s;es capable of pre&s;erving dead bodies; among
which we may reckon the qualities of the earth in which they are buried. If the
earth be drying and a&s;trin|gent, it will imbibe the humidity of the body; and
it may be probably for this rea&s;on that the bodies buried in the mona&s;tery
of the Cor|deliers, at Thoulou&s;e, do not putrify, but dry in &s;uch a manner
that one may lift them up by one arm.</P>
<P>The gums, re&s;ins, and bitumens, with which dead bodies are
embalmed, keep off the impre&s;|&s;ions which they would el&s;e receive from
the al|teration of the temperature of the air; and &s;till 
<PB N="277" REF="295"> more, if a body thus prepared be placed in a dry or
burning &s;and, the mo&s;t powerful means will be united for its
pre&s;ervation. We are not to be &s;urprized, therefore, at what we are told by
Chardin, of the county of Choro&s;an, in Per&s;ia. The bodies which have been
previou&s;ly embalmed, and buried in the &s;ands of that country, as he
a&s;&s;ures us, are found to petrify, or, in other words, to become extremely
hard, and are pre&s;erved for &s;everal ages. It is a&s;|&s;erted that &s;ome
of them have continued for a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, as has been mentioned above, &s;wathed the body with
linen bands, and enclo&s;ed it in a coffin; however, it is pro|bable that, with
all the&s;e precautions, they would not have continued till now, if the tombs,
or pits, in which they were placed, had not been dug in a dry chalky &s;oil,
which was not &s;u&s;ceptible of humidity; and which was, be|&s;ides, covered
over with a dry &s;and of &s;everal feet thickne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;epulchres of the ancient Egyptians &s;ub|&s;i&s;t to this
day. Mo&s;t travellers who have been in Egypt, have de&s;cribed tho&s;e of
ancient mummies, and have &s;een the mummies interred there. The&s;e catacombs
are within two leagues of the ruins of this city, nine leagues from 
<PB N="278" REF="296"> Grand Cairo, and about two miles from the vil|lage of
Zaccara. They extend from thence to the Pyramids of Pharaoh, which are about
eight miles di&s;tant. The&s;e &s;epulchres lie in a field, covered with a fine
running &s;and, of a yellowi&s;h colour. The country is dry and hilly; the
entrance of the tomb is choaked up with &s;and; there are many open, but
&s;everal more that are &s;till concealed. The inhabitants of the neighbouring
village have no other com|merce, or method of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, but by
&s;eeking out mummies, and &s;elling them to &s;uch &s;tran|gers as happen to
be at Grand Cairo. 
<Q REND="inline">"This commerce, &s;ome years ago, was not only a
very common, but a very gainful one. A complete mummy was often &s;old for
twenty pounds: but it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that it was bought at &s;uch
an high price from a mere pa&s;&s;ion for an|tiquity; there were much more
powerful mo|tives for this traffic. Mummy at that time made a con&s;iderable
article in medicine; and a thou&s;and imaginary virtues were a&s;cribed to it,
for the cure of mo&s;t di&s;orders, particularly of the paralytic kind. There
was no &s;hop, therefore, without mummy in it; and no phy&s;ician thought he
had properly treated his patient, without adding this to his pre&s;cription.
In|duced by the general repute, in which this &s;up|po&s;ed 
<PB N="279" REF="297"> drug was at that time, &s;everal Jews, both of Italy and
France, found out the art of imi|tating mummy &s;o exactly, that they, for a
long time, deceived all Europe. This they did by drying dead bodies in ovens,
after having prepared them with myrrh, aloes, and bitumen. Still, however, the
reque&s;t for mummies con|tinued, and a variety of cures were daily a&s;cribed
to them. At length, Paraeus wrote a treati&s;e on their total inefficacy in
phy&s;ic; and &s;hewed their abu&s;e in loading the &s;tomach, to the
exclu&s;ion of more efficacious medicines. From that time, therefore, their
reputation began to decline; the Jews di&s;continued their counterfeits, and
the trade returned entire to the Egyptians, when it was of no longer value. The
indu&s;try of &s;eeking after mummies is now totally relaxed, their price
merely arbitrary, and ju&s;t what the curious are willing to give."</Q></P>
<P>In &s;eeking for mummies, they fir&s;t clear away the &s;and, which
they may do for weeks together, without finding what they want. Upon coming to
a little &s;quare opening, of about eighteen feet in depth, they de&s;cend into
it, by holes for the feet, placed at proper in|tervals; and there they are
&s;ure of finding what they &s;eek for. The&s;e caves, or wells, as they call
them there, are hollowed out of a white <PB N="280" REF="298"> free-&s;tone,
which is found in all this country a few feet below the covering of &s;and.
When one gets to the bottom of the&s;e, which are &s;ometimes forty feet below
the &s;urface, there are &s;everal &s;quare openings, on each &s;ide, into
pa&s;&s;ages of ten or fifteen feet wide, and the&s;e lead to chambers of
fifteen or twenty feet &s;quare. The&s;e are all hewn out into the rock; and in
each of the catacombs are to be found &s;everal of the&s;e apartments,
communicating with each other. They extend a great way under ground, &s;o as to
be under the city of Memphis, and in a manner to undermine its environs.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the chambers, the walls are adorned with figures and
hieroglyphics; in others, the mummies are found in tombs, round the apartment
hollowed out in the rock. The&s;e tombs are upright, and cut into the &s;hape
of a man, with his arms &s;tretched out. There are &s;till others found, and
the&s;e in the greate&s;t num|ber, in wooden coffins, or in cloaths covered
with bitumen. The&s;e coffins, or wrappers, are all over covered with a variety
of ornaments. There are &s;ome of them painted, and are adorned with figures,
&s;uch as that of death, and the leaden &s;eals, on which &s;everal characters
are engraven. Some of the&s;e coffins are carved <PB N="281" REF="299"> into
the human &s;hape; but the head alone is di&s;tingui&s;hable; the re&s;t of the
body is all of a piece, and terminated by a pede&s;tal, while there are &s;ome
with their arms hanging down; and it is by the&s;e marks that the bodies of
per|&s;ons of rank are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the meaner order.
The&s;e are generally found lying on the floor, without any profu&s;ion of
orna|ments; and in &s;ome chambers the mummies are found indi&s;criminately
piled upon each other, and buried in the &s;and.</P>
<P>Many mummies are found lying on their backs; their heads turned to
the north, and the hands placed on the belly. The bands of linen, with which
the&s;e are &s;wathed, are found to be more than a thou&s;and yards long; and,
of con&s;equence, the number of circumvolu|tions they make about the body
mu&s;t have been amazing. The&s;e were performed by beginning at the head, and
ending at the feet; but they contrived it &s;o as to avoid covering the face.
However, when the face is entirely uncovered, it moulders into du&s;t
immediately upon the admi&s;&s;ion of the air. When, therefore, it is
pre&s;erved entire, a &s;light covering of cloth is &s;o di&s;po&s;ed over it,
as that the &s;hape of the eye, the no&s;e, and the mouth, are &s;een under it.
Some mummies have been found with a long <PB N="282" REF="300"> beard, and hair
that reached down to the mid-leg, nails of a &s;urprizing length, and &s;ome
gilt, or at lea&s;t painted of a gold colour. Some are found with bands upon
the brea&s;t, covered with hieroglyphics, in gold, &s;ilver, or in green; and
&s;ome with tutelary idols, and other figures of ja&s;per, within their body. A
piece of gold, al&s;o, has often been found under their tongues, of about two
pi&s;toles value; and, for this rea&s;on, the Arabians &s;poil all the mummies
they meet with, in order to get at the gold.</P>
<P>But, although art, or accident, has thus been found to pre&s;erve
dead bodies entire, it mu&s;t by no means be &s;uppo&s;ed that it is capable of
pre&s;erving the exact form and lineaments of the decea&s;ed per&s;on. Tho&s;e
bodies which are found dried away in the De&s;arts, or in &s;ome particular
church-yards, are totally deformed and &s;carce any lineaments remain of their
external &s;tructure. Nor are the mummies pre|&s;erved by embalming, in a
better condition. The fle&s;h is dried away, hardened, and hidden under a
variety of bandages; the bowels, as we have &s;een, are totally removed; and
from hence, in the mo&s;t perfect of them, we &s;ee only a &s;hapele&s;s ma&s;s
of &s;kin di&s;coloured; and even the features &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable.
The art is, therefore, an effort rather of pre&s;erving <PB N="283" REF="301">
the &s;ub&s;tance than the likene&s;s of the decea&s;ed; and has,
con&s;equently, not been brought to its highe&s;t pitch of perfection. It
appears from a mummy, not long &s;ince dug up in France, that the art of
embalming was more completely under&s;tood in the we&s;tern world than even in
Egypt it&s;elf. This mummy, which was dug up at Auvergne, was an amazing
in&s;tance of their &s;kill, and is one of the mo&s;t curious reliques in the
art of pre&s;ervation. As &s;ome pea&s;ants, in that part of the world, were
digging in a field near Rion, within about twenty-&s;ix paces of the highway,
between that and the river Artier, they di&s;covered a tomb, that was about a
foot and a half beneath the &s;urface. It was compo&s;ed only of two &s;tones;
one of which formed the body of the &s;epulchre, and the other the cover. This
tomb was of free-&s;tone; &s;even feet and an half long, three feet and a half
broad, and about three feet high. It was of rude workman&s;hip; the cover had
been poli&s;hed, but was without figure or in|&s;cription: within this tomb was
placed a leaden coffin, four feet &s;even inches long, fourteen inches broad,
and fifteen high. It was not made coffin fa&s;hion, but oblong, like a box,
equally broad at both ends, and covered with a lid that fitted on like a
&s;nuff-box, without <PB N="284" REF="302"> an hinge. This cover had two holes
in it, each of about two inches long, and very narrow, filled with a
&s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling butter; but for what purpo&s;e intended remains
unknown. Within this coffin was a mummy, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t perfect
pre&s;ervation. The internal &s;ides of the coffin were filled with an aromatic
&s;ub&s;tance, mingled with clay. Round the mummy was wrapped a coar&s;e cloth,
in form of a napkin; under this were two &s;hirts, or &s;hrouds, of the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite texture; be|neath the&s;e a bandage, which covered all parts of the
body, like an infant in &s;wadling cloaths; &s;till, under this general bandage
there was another, which went particularly round the extremities, the hands and
the legs. The head was covered with two caps; the feet and hands were without
any particular ban|dages; and the whole body was covered with an aromatic
&s;ub&s;tance, an inch thick. When the&s;e were removed, and the body expo&s;ed
naked to view, nothing could be more a&s;to|ni&s;hing than the pre&s;ervation
of the whole, and the exact re&s;emblance it bore to a body that had but ju&s;t
been dead a day or two before. It ap|peared well proportioned, except that the
head was rather large, and the feet &s;mall. The &s;kin had all the pliancy and
colour of a body lately <PB N="285" REF="303"> dead; the vi&s;age, however, was
of a browni&s;h hue. The belly yielded to the touch; all the joints were
flexible, except tho&s;e of the legs and feet; the fingers &s;tretched forth of
them|&s;elves when bent inwards. The nails &s;till con|tinued perfect; and all
the marks of the joints, both in the fingers, the palms of the hands, and the
&s;oles of the feet, remained perfectly vi|&s;ible. The bones of the arms and
legs were &s;oft and pliant; but, on the contrary, tho&s;e of the &s;kull
pre&s;erved their rigidity; the hair, which only covered the back of the head,
was of a che&s;nut colour, and about two inches long. The pericranum at top was
&s;eparated from the &s;kull, by an inci&s;ion, in order to open that for the
introducing proper aromatics in the place of the brain, where they were found
mixed with clay. The teeth, the tongue, and the ears, were all pre&s;erved in
perfect form. The inte&s;tines were not taken out of the body, but remained
pliant and entire, as in a fre&s;h &s;ub|ject; and the brea&s;t was made to
ri&s;e and fall like a pair of bellows. The embalming pre|paration had a very
&s;trong and pungent &s;mell, which the body pre&s;erved for more than a month
after it was expo&s;ed to the air. This odour was perceived whenever the mummy
was laid; although it remained there but a very <PB N="286" REF="304"> &s;hort
time, it was even pretended that the pea|&s;ants of the neighbouring villages
were incom|moded by it. If one touched either the mummy, or any part of the
preparation, the hands &s;melt of it for &s;everal hours after, although
wa&s;hed with water, &s;pirit of wine, or vinegar. This mummy, having remained
expo&s;ed for &s;ome months to the curio&s;ity of the public, began to &s;uffer
&s;ome mutilations. A part of the &s;kin of the forehead was cut off; all its
teeth were drawn out, and &s;ome attempts were made to pull away the tongue. It
was, therefore, put into a gla&s;s-ca&s;e, and &s;hortly after tran&s;mitted to
the king of France's cabinet, at Paris.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons to believe this to be the body of a
per&s;on of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction; however, no marks remain to a&s;&s;ure
us either of the quality of the per&s;on, or the time of his decea&s;e. There
only are to be &s;een &s;ome irre|gular figures on the coffin; one of which
repre|&s;ents a kind of &s;tar. There were al&s;o &s;ome &s;in|gular characters
upon the bandages, which were totally defaced by tho&s;e who had torn them
away. However, it &s;hould &s;eem that it had remained for &s;everal ages in
this &s;tate, &s;ince the fir&s;t years immediately &s;ucceeding the interment,
are u&s;ually tho&s;e in which the body is mo&s;t liable to decay. It appears
al&s;o to be a much <PB N="287" REF="305"> more perfect method of embalming
than that of the Egyptians; as in this the fle&s;h continues with its natural
ela&s;ticity and colour, the bowels remain entire, and the joints have almo&s;t
the pliancy which they had when the per&s;on was alive. Upon the whole, it is
probable that a much le&s;s tedious preparation than that u&s;ed by the
Egyptians would have &s;ufficed to keep the body from putrefaction; and that an
injection of petreoleum inwardly, and a layer of a&s;phal|tum without, would
have &s;ufficed to have made a mummy; and it is remarkable that Auvergne, where
this was found, affords the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances in &s;ufficient plenty. This
art, therefore, might be brought to greater per|fection than it has arrived at
hitherto, were the art worth pre&s;erving. But mankind have long &s;ince grown
wi&s;er in this re&s;pect; and are con|tented no longer to keep by them a
deformed carca&s;s, which, in&s;tead of aiding their magni|ficence, mu&s;t only
&s;erve to mortify their pride.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING man, we now de&s;cend to the lower ranks of animated nature,
and prepare to examine the life, manners, and characters of the&s;e our humble
partners in the creation. But, in &s;uch a wonderful variety as is diffu&s;ed
around us, where &s;hall we begin. The num|ber of beings endued with life as
well as we, &s;eems, at fir&s;t view, infinite. Not only the fo|re&s;t, the
waters, the air, teems with animals of various kinds; but almo&s;t every
vegetable, every leaf, has millions of minute inhabitants, each of which fill
up the circle of its allotted life, and &s;ome of which are found objects of
the greate&s;t curio&s;ity. In this &s;eeming exube|rance of animals, it is
natural enough for igno|rance to lie down in hopele&s;s uncertainty, and to
declare what requires labour to particularize to be utterly in&s;crutable. It
is otherwi&s;e how|ever with the active and &s;earching mind; no way
intimidated with the immen&s;e variety, it begins the ta&s;k of numbering,
grouping and cla&s;&s;ing all the various kind that fall within its notice;
finds every day new relations between <PB N="289" REF="307"> the &s;everal
parts of the creation, acquires the art of con&s;idering &s;everal at a time
under one point of view; and, at la&s;t, begins to find that the variety is
neither &s;o great nor &s;o in&s;crutable as was at fir&s;t imagined. As in a
clear night, the number of the &s;tars &s;eems infinite; yet, if we
&s;edulou&s;ly attend to each in its place, and regularly cla&s;s them, they
will &s;oon be found to dimini&s;h, and come within a very &s;canty
com|putation.</P>
<P>Method, therefore, is one of the principal helps in natural
hi&s;tory, and without it very little progre&s;s can be made in this &s;cience.
It is by that alone we can hope to di&s;&s;ipate that glare, if I may &s;o
expre&s;s it, that ari&s;es from a multiplicity of objects at once pre&s;enting
them&s;elves to the view. It is method that fixes the attention to one point,
and leads it, by &s;low and certain degrees, to leave no part of nature
unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>All naturali&s;ts, therefore, have been very careful in adopting
&s;ome method of cla&s;&s;ing or grouping the &s;everal parts of nature; and
&s;ome have written books of natural hi&s;tory with no other view. The&s;e
methodical divi|&s;ions &s;ome have treated with contempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. Buffon in his Introduction, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>, not
con&s;idering that books, in general, are written <PB N="290" REF="308"> with
oppo&s;ite views: &s;ome to be read, and &s;ome only to be occa&s;ionally
con&s;ulted. The methodi&s;ts, in natural hi&s;tory, &s;eem to be con|tent with
the latter advantage; and have &s;a|crificed to order alone, all the delights
of the &s;ubject, all the arts of heightening, awakening, or continuing
curio&s;ity. But they certainly have the &s;ame u&s;e in &s;cience that a
dictionary has in language; but with this difference, that in a dictionary we
proceed from the name to the definition; in a &s;y&s;tem of natural hi&s;tory,
we proceed from the definition to find out the thing. Without the aid of
&s;y&s;tem, nature mu&s;t &s;till have lain undi&s;tingui&s;hed, like furniture
in a lumber room; every thing we wi&s;h for is there, indeed; but we know not
where to find it. If, for in&s;tance, in a morning excur&s;ion, I find a plant,
or an in&s;ect, the name of which I de&s;ire to learn; or, perhaps, am curious
to know whether already known; in this enquiry I can expect information only
from one of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which, being couched in a methodical form,
quickly directs me to what I &s;eek for. Thus we will &s;uppo&s;e that our
enquirer has met with a &s;pider, and that he has never &s;een &s;uch an
in|&s;ect before. He is taught by the writer of a &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaeus.</BIBL></NOTE> to examine whether it has wings, and
<PB N="291" REF="309"> he finds that it has none. He, therefore, is to look for
it among the wingle&s;s in&s;ects, or the Aptera, as he calls them; he then is
to &s;ee whether the head and brea&s;t make one part of the body, or are
di&s;united: he finds they make one: he is then to reckon the number of feet
and eyes, and he finds that it has eight of each. The in&s;ect, therefore,
mu&s;t be either a &s;corpion or a &s;pider; but he la&s;tly examines its
feelers, which he finds clavated, or clubbed; and, by all the&s;e marks, he at
la&s;t di&s;covers it to be a &s;pider. Of &s;piders, there are forty-&s;even
&s;orts; and, by reading the de&s;cription of each, the enquirer will learn the
name of that which he de&s;ires to know. With the name of the in&s;ect, he is
al&s;o directed to tho&s;e authors that have given any account of it, and the
page where that account is to be found; by this means he may know at once what
has been &s;aid of that animal by others, and what there is of novelty in the
re&s;ult of his own re|&s;earches.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, it will appear how u&s;eful tho&s;e
&s;y&s;tems in natural hi&s;tory are to the enquirer; but, having given them
all their merit, it would be wrong not to ob&s;erve, that they have in general
been very much abu&s;ed. Their authors, in general, &s;eem to think that 
<PB N="292" REF="310"> they are improvers of natural hi&s;tory, when in reality
they are but guides; they &s;eem to boa&s;t that they are adding to our
knowledge, while they are only arranging it. The&s;e authors al&s;o, &s;eem to
think that the reading of their works and &s;y&s;tems, is the be&s;t method to
attain a knowledge of nature; but, &s;etting a&s;ide the im|po&s;&s;ibility of
getting through whole volumes of a dry long catalogue, the multiplicity of
who&s;e contents is too great for even the &s;tronge&s;t me|mory; &s;uch works
rather tell us the names than the hi&s;tory of the creature we de&s;ire to
en|quire after. In the&s;e dreary pages, every in|&s;ect, or plant, that has a
name, makes as di|&s;tingui&s;hed a figure as the mo&s;t wonderful, or the
mo&s;t u&s;eful. The true end of &s;tudying nature is to make a ju&s;t
&s;election, to find tho&s;e parts of it that mo&s;t conduce to our plea&s;ure
or convenience, and to leave the re&s;t in greater neglect. But the&s;e
&s;y&s;tems, employing the &s;ame degree of attention upon all, give us no
opportunities of knowing which mo&s;t de&s;erves attention; and he who has made
his know|ledge from &s;uch &s;y&s;tems only, has his memory crouded with a
number of trifling, or minute particulars, which it &s;hould be his
bu&s;ine&s;s and his labour to forget. The&s;e books, as was &s;aid before, are
u&s;eful to be con&s;ulted, but they are <PB N="293" REF="311"> very
unnece&s;&s;ary to be read; no enquirer in nature &s;hould be without one of
them; and without any doubt Linnaeus de&s;erves the pre|ference.</P>
<P>One fault more, in almo&s;t all the&s;e &s;y&s;tematic writers, and
that which leads me to the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent chapter, is, that
&s;eeing the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of methodical di&s;tribution in &s;ome parts of
nature, they have introduced it into all. Finding the utility of arranging
plants, birds, or in&s;ects, they have arranged quadrupedes al&s;o with the
&s;ame a&s;&s;iduity; and although the num|ber of the&s;e is &s;o few as not to
reach two hundred, they have darkened the &s;ubject with di&s;tinctions and
divi&s;ions, which only &s;erve to puzzle and perplex. All method is only
u&s;e|ful in giving per&s;picuity, where the &s;ubject is either dark or
copious: but with regard to qua|drupedes, the number is but few; many of them
we are well acquainted with by habit; and the re&s;t may very readily be known,
without any method. In treating of &s;uch, therefore, it would be u&s;ele&s;s
to confound the reader with a multiplicity of divi&s;ions; as quadrupedes are
con&s;picuous enough to obtain the &s;econd rank in nature, it becomes us to be
acquainted with, at lea&s;t, the names of them all. However, as there are
naturali&s;ts who have gained a name <PB N="294" REF="312"> from the excellence
of their methods, in cla&s;&s;ing the&s;e animals, &s;ome readers may de&s;ire
to have a knowledge of what has been laboriou&s;ly in|vented for their
in&s;truction. I will ju&s;t take leave, therefore, to mention the mo&s;t
applauded methods of cla&s;&s;ing animals, as adopted by Ray, Klein, and
Linnaeus; for it often happens, that the terms which have been long u&s;ed in a
&s;cience, though frivolous, become, by pre&s;crip|tion, a part of the
&s;cience it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ray, after Ari&s;totle, divides all animals into two kinds; tho&s;e
which have blood, and tho&s;e which are bloodle&s;s. In the la&s;t cla&s;s, he
places all the in&s;ect tribes. The former he di|vides into &s;uch as breathe
through the lungs, and &s;uch as breathe through gills: the&s;e la&s;t
comprehend the fi&s;hes. In tho&s;e which breathe through the lungs, &s;ome
have the heart com|po&s;ed of two ventricles, and &s;ome have it of one. Of the
la&s;t are all animals of the cetaceous kind, all oviparous quadrupedes, and
&s;erpents. Of tho&s;e that have two ventricles, &s;ome are oviparous, which
are the birds; and &s;ome vivi|parous, which are quadrupedes. The quadru|pedes
he divides into &s;uch as have an hoof, and &s;uch as are claw-footed. Tho&s;e
with the hoof, he divides into &s;uch as have it undivided, &s;uch as have it
cloven, and &s;uch as have the <PB N="295" REF="313"> hoof divided into more
parts, as the rhinoceros, and hippopotamos. Animals with the cloven hoof, he
divides into &s;uch as chew the cud, &s;uch as the cow, and the &s;heep; and
&s;uch as are not ruminant, as the hog. He divides tho&s;e ani|mals that chew
the cud, into four kinds: the fir&s;t have hollow horns, which they never
&s;hed, as the cow; the &s;econd is of a le&s;s &s;pecies, and is of the
&s;heep kind; the third is of the goat kind; and the la&s;t, which have &s;olid
horns, and &s;hed them annually, are of the deer kind. Coming to the
claw-footed animals, he finds &s;ome with large claws, re&s;embling the fingers
of the human hand; and the&s;e he makes the ape kind. Of the others, &s;ome
have the foot divided in two, and have a claw to each divi&s;ion; the&s;e are
the camel kind. The ele|phant makes a kind by it&s;elf, as its claws are
covered over by a &s;kin. The re&s;t of the nume|rous tribe of claw-footed
animals, he divides into two kinds; the analogous, or &s;uch as re|&s;emble
each other; and the anomalous, which differ from the re&s;t. The analogous
claw-footed animals, are of two kinds: they have more than two cutting teeth in
each jaw, &s;uch as the lion and the dog, which are carnivorous; or they have
but two cutting teeth in each jaw; and the&s;e are chiefly fed upon vegetables.
<PB N="296" REF="314"> The carnivorous kinds are divided into the great and the
little. The great carnivorous animals are divided into &s;uch as have a &s;hort
&s;nout, as the cat and the lion; and &s;uch as have it long and pointed, as
the dog and the wolf. The little claw-footed carnivorous ani|mals, differ from
the great, in having a pro|portionably &s;maller head, and a &s;lender body,
that fits them for creeping into holes, in pur|&s;uit of their prey, like
worms; and they are therefore called the vermin kind.</P>
<P>We &s;ee, from this &s;ketch of divi&s;ion and &s;ub|divi&s;ion, how
a &s;ubject, extremely delightful and amu&s;ing in it&s;elf, may be darkened,
and ren|dered di&s;gu&s;ting. But, notwith&s;tanding, Ray &s;eems to be one of
the mo&s;t &s;imple di&s;tributors; and his method is &s;till, and not without
rea&s;on, adopted by many. Such as have been at the trouble to learn this
method, will certainly find it u&s;eful; nor would we be thought, in the
lea&s;t, to take from its merits; all we contend for is, that the &s;ame
information may be ob|tained by a plea&s;anter and an ea&s;ier method.</P>
<P>It was the great &s;ucce&s;s of Ray's method, that &s;oon after
produced &s;uch a variety of at|tempts in the &s;ame manner; but almo&s;t all
le&s;s &s;imple, and more ob&s;cure. Mr. Klein's me|thod is briefly as follows:
he makes the power <PB N="297" REF="315"> of changing place, the
characteri&s;tic mark of animals in general; and he takes their di|&s;tinctions
from their aptitude and fitne&s;s for &s;uch a change. Some change place by
means of feet, or &s;ome &s;imilar contrivance; others have wings and feet:
&s;ome can change place only in water, and have only fins; &s;ome go upon
earth, without any feet at all: &s;ome change place, by moving their &s;hell;
and &s;ome move only at a certain time of the year. Of &s;uch, however, as do
not move at all, he takes no notice. The quadrupedes that move chiefly by means
of four feet upon land, he divides into two orders. The fir&s;t are the hoofed
kind; and the &s;econd, the claw kind. Each of the&s;e orders is divided into
four fa|milies. The fir&s;t family of the hoofed kind, are the &s;ingle hoofed,
&s;uch as the hor&s;e, a&s;s, &amp;c. The &s;econd family are &s;uch as have
the hoof cloven into two parts, &s;uch as the cow, &amp;c. The third family
have the hoof divided into three parts; and in this family is found only the
rhinoceros. The fourth family have the hoof divided into five parts; and in
this is only to be found the elephant. With re&s;pect to the clawed kind, the
fir&s;t family comprehends tho&s;e that have but two claws on each foot, as the
camel; the &s;econd family have three claws; <PB N="298" REF="316"> the third,
four; and the fourth, five. This me|thod of taking the di&s;tinctions of
animals from the organs of motion, is ingenious; but it is, at the &s;ame time,
incomplete: and, be&s;ides, the divi&s;ions into which it mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily fall, is inadequate; &s;ince, for in&s;tance, in his family
with two claws, there is but one animal; whereas, in his family with five
claws, there are above an hundred.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on, who has laboured this &s;ubject with great accuracy,
divides animated nature into nine cla&s;&s;es: namely, quadrupedes; cetaceous
animals, or tho&s;e of the whale kind; birds; rep|tiles, or tho&s;e of the
&s;erpent kind; cartilaginous fi&s;hes; &s;pinous fi&s;hes; &s;helled animals;
in&s;ects; and worms. He divides the quadrupedes into eighteen orders; and
takes their di&s;tinctions, from the number and form of their teeth.</P>
<P>But of all tho&s;e who&s;e &s;y&s;tems have been adopted and
admired, Linnaeus is the foremo&s;t; as, with a &s;tudied brevity, his
&s;y&s;tem compre|hends the greate&s;t variety, in the &s;malle&s;t
&s;pace.</P>
<P>According to him, the fir&s;t di&s;tinction of animals is to be
taken from their internal &s;tructure. Some have the heart with two
ven|tricles, and hot red blood: namely, quadrupedes and birds. The quadrupedes
are viviparous, and the birds oviparous.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="317">Some have the heart with but one ventricle,
and cold red blood; namely, amphibia and fi&s;hes. The amphibia are furni&s;hed
with lungs; the fi&s;hes, with gills.</P>
<P>Some have the heart with one ventricle, and cold white &s;erum;
namely, in&s;ects and worms: the in&s;ects have feelers; and the worms,
holders.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctions of quadrupedes, or animals with paps, as he calls
them, are taken from their teeth. He divides them into &s;even or|ders; to
which he gives names that are not ea&s;y of tran&s;lation: Primates, or
principals, with four cutting teeth in each jaw; Bruta, or brutes, with no
cutting teeth; Ferae, or wild bea&s;ts, with generally &s;ix cutting teeth in
each jaw; Glires, or dormice, with two cutting teeth, both above and below;
Pecora, or cattle, with many cutting teeth above, and none below; Belluae, or
bea&s;ts, with the fore teeth blunt; Cete, or tho&s;e of the whale kind, with
cartilaginous teeth. I have but ju&s;t &s;ketched out this &s;y&s;tem, as
being, in its own nature, the clo&s;e&s;t abridgment; it would take volumes to
dilate it to its proper length. The names of the differ|ent animals, and their
cla&s;&s;es, alone makes two thick octavo volumes; and yet nothing is given but
the &s;lighte&s;t de&s;cription of each. I <PB N="300" REF="318"> have omitted
all critici&s;m al&s;o, upon the ac|curacy of the preceding &s;y&s;tems: this
has been done both by Buffon and Daubenton, not with le&s;s truth than humour,
for they had too much good &s;en&s;e not to &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of
multi|plying the terms of &s;cience to no end, and di&s;|appointing our
curio&s;ity rather with a catalogue of nature's varieties than an hi&s;tory of
nature.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of taxing the memory and teizing the patience
with &s;uch a variety of di|vi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions, I will take leave
to cla&s;s the productions of nature in the mo&s;t ob|vious, though not in the
mo&s;t accurate man|ner. In natural hi&s;tory, of all other &s;ciences, there
is the lea&s;t danger of ob&s;curity. In morals, or in metaphy&s;ics, every
definition mu&s;t be preci&s;e, becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;ciences are built upon
definitions; but it is otherwi&s;e in tho&s;e &s;ubjects where the exhibition
of the object it&s;elf is always capable of correcting the error. Thus it may
often happen that in a lax &s;y&s;tem of natural hi&s;tory, a creature may be
ranked among quadrupedes that belongs more pro|perly to the fi&s;h or the
in&s;ect cla&s;&s;es. But that can produce very little confu&s;ion, and every
reader can thus make a &s;y&s;tem the mo&s;t agree|able to his own imagination.
It will be of no manner of con&s;equence whether we call a bird 
<PB N="301" REF="319"> or an in&s;ect a quadrupede, if we are careful in
marking all its di&s;tinctions: the uncertainty in rea&s;oning, or thinking,
that the&s;e approxima|tions of the different kinds of animals produce, is but
very &s;mall, and happens but very rarely; whereas the labour that
naturali&s;ts have been at to keep the kinds a&s;under, had been exce&s;&s;ive.
This, in general, has given birth to that va|riety of &s;y&s;tems which we have
ju&s;t mentioned, each of which &s;eems to be almo&s;t as good as the
preceding.</P>
<P>Taking, therefore, this latitude, and u&s;ing method only where it
contributes to conci&s;e|ne&s;s or per&s;picuity, we &s;hall divide animated
nature into four cla&s;&s;es; namely, quadrupedes, birds, fi&s;hes, and
in&s;ects. All the&s;e &s;eem in general pretty well di&s;tingui&s;hed from
each other by nature; yet there are &s;everal in&s;tances in which we can
&s;carce tell whether it is a bird or a quadrupede that we are about to
examine; whether it is a fi&s;h or an in&s;ect that offers to our curio&s;ity.
Nature is varied by impercep|tible gradations, &s;o that no line can be drawn
between any two cla&s;&s;es of its productions, and no definition made to
comprehend them all. However, the di&s;tinctions between the&s;e cla&s;&s;es
are &s;ufficiently marked in general; and their encroachments upon each other
are &s;o rare, that <PB N="302" REF="320"> it will be &s;ufficient particularly
to apprize the reader when they happen to be blended.</P>
<P>There are many quadrupedes that we are well acquainted with; and of
tho&s;e we do not know we &s;hall form the mo&s;t clear and di&s;tinct
conceptions, by being told wherein they differ, and wherein they re&s;emble
tho&s;e with which we are familiar. Each cla&s;s of qua|drupedes may be ranged
under &s;ome one of the dome&s;tic kinds, that may &s;erve for the mo|del by
which we are to form &s;ome kind of idea of the re&s;t. Thus we may &s;ay that
a tiger is of the cat kind, a wolf of the dog kind, be|cau&s;e there are &s;ome
rude re&s;emblances between each; and a per&s;on who has never &s;een the wild
animals will have &s;ome incomplete knowledge of their figure from the tame
ones. On the contrary, I will not, as &s;ome &s;y&s;tematic writers have
done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;t.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;ay that a
bat is of the human kind, or an hog of the hor&s;e kind, merely becau&s;e there
is &s;ome re&s;emblance in their teeth, or their paps. For, although this
re&s;emblance may be &s;triking enough, yet a per&s;on who has never &s;een a
bat or a hog, will never form any ju&s;t conception of either, by being told of
this minute &s;imilitude. In &s;hort, the method in cla&s;&s;ing quadrupedes
&s;hould be taken from their <PB N="303" REF="321"> mo&s;t &s;triking
re&s;emblances; and where the&s;e re&s;emblances do not offer, we &s;hould not
force the &s;imilitude, but leave the animal to be de|&s;cribed as a &s;olitary
&s;pecies, by it&s;elf. The number of quadrupedes, is &s;o few that, indeed,
without any method what&s;oever, there is no great, danger of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>All quadrupedes, the number of which, ac|cording to Buffon, amounts
to but two hundred, may be cla&s;&s;ed in the following manner.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, tho&s;e of the Hor&s;e kind. This cla&s;s contains the
Hor&s;e, the A&s;s, and the Zebra. Of the&s;e, none have horns; and their hoof
is of one &s;olid piece.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s are tho&s;e of the Cow kind; comprehending the
Urus, the Buffalo, the Bi|&s;on, and the Bona&s;&s;as. The&s;e have cloven
hoofs, and chew the cud.</P>
<P>The third cla&s;s is that of the Sheep kind; with cloven hoofs, and
chewing the cud, like the former. In this is comprehended the Sheep, the Goat,
the Lama, the Vigogne, the Gazella, the Guinea deer, and all of a &s;imilar
form.</P>
<P>The fourth cla&s;s is that of the Deer kind, with cloven hoofs, and
with &s;olid horns, that are &s;hed every year. This cla&s;s contains the Elk,
the Rein-deer, the Stag, the Buck, the Roe-buck, and the Axis.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="322">The fifth cla&s;s comprehends all tho&s;e of
the Hog kind, the Pecari, and the Bayberrou&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth cla&s;s is that numerous one of the Cat kind. This
comprehends the Cat, the Lion, the Panther, the Leopard, the Jaguar, the
Cou|gar, the Jaguarette, the Lynx, the Ounce, and the Catamountain. The&s;e are
all carnivorous, and furni&s;hed with crooked claws, which they can &s;heath
and un&s;heath at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh cla&s;s is that of the Dog kind, carnivorous, and
furni&s;hed with claws like the former, but which they cannot &s;heath. This
cla&s;s comprehends the Dog, the Wolf, the Fox, the Jackall, the I&s;atis, the
Hyena, the Civette, the Gibet, and the Genet.</P>
<P>The eighth cla&s;s is that of the Wea&s;il kind, with a long &s;mall
body, with five toes, or claws, on each foot; the fir&s;t of them &s;eparated
from the re&s;t like a thumb. This comprehends the Wea&s;il, the Martin, the
Pole-cat, the Ferrit, the Mangou&s;t, the Van&s;ire, the Ermin, with all the
varieties of the American Moufettes.</P>
<P>The ninth cla&s;s is that of the Rabbit kind, with two large cutting
teeth in each jaw. This comprehends the Rabbit, the Hare, the Guinea-pig, all
the various &s;pecies of the Squirrel, the Dormou&s;e, the Marrnotte, the Rat,
the Mou&s;e, Agouti, the Paca, the Aperea, and the Tapeti.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="323">The tenth cla&s;s is that of the Hedge-hog
kind, with claw feet, and covered with prickles, comprehending the Hedge-hog
and the Porcu|pine, the Couendou, and the Ur&s;on.</P>
<P>The eleventh cla&s;s is that of the Tortoi&s;e kind, covered with a
&s;hell, or &s;cales. This comprehends the Tortoi&s;e; the Pangolin, and the
Phataguin.</P>
<P>The twelfth is if the Otter, or amphibious kind, comprehending the
Otter, the Beaver, the De&s;man, the Mor&s;e, and the Seal.</P>
<P>The thirteenth cla&s;s is that of the Ape and Monkey kinds, with
hands, and feet re&s;embling hinds.</P>
<P>The fifteenth cla&s;s is that of winged qua|drupedes, or the Bat
kind, containing the Bat, the Flying Squirrel, and &s;ome other varieties.</P>
<P>The animals which &s;eem to approach no other kind, either in
nature, or in form, but to make each a di&s;tinct &s;pecies in it&s;elf, are
the following: the Elephant, the Rhinoceros, the Hippopotamos, the Camelopard,
the Camel, the Bear, the Badger, the Tapir, the Cabiai, the Coati, the Antbear,
the Tatou, and la&s;tly the Sloth.</P>
<P>All other quadrupedes, who&s;e names are not &s;et down, will be
found among &s;ome of the above-mentioned cla&s;&s;es, and referred to that 
<PB N="306" REF="324"> which they mo&s;t re&s;emble. When, therefore, we are at
a lo&s;s to know the name of any par|ticular animal, by examining which of the
known kinds it mo&s;t re&s;embles, either in &s;hape, or in hoofs, or claws;
and then, examining the particular de&s;cription, we &s;hall be able to
di&s;cover not only its name, but its hi&s;tory. I have already &s;aid that all
methods of this kind are merely arbitrary, and that nature makes no exact
di&s;tinction between her productions. It is hard, for in&s;tance, to tell
whether we ought to refer the Civet to the dog, or the cat kind; but, if we
know the exact hi&s;tory of the civet, it is no great matter to which kind we
&s;hall judge it to bear the greate&s;t re&s;emblance. It is enough that a
di&s;tribution of this kind ex|cites in us &s;ome rude out-lines of the make,
or &s;ome marked &s;imilitudes in the nature of the&s;e animals; but, to know
them with any preci&s;ion, no &s;y&s;tem, or even de&s;cription will &s;erve,
&s;ince the animal it&s;elf, or a good print of it, mu&s;t be &s;een, and its
hi&s;tory be read at length, be|fore it can be &s;aid to be known. To pretend
to &s;ay that we have an idea of a quadrupede, becau&s;e we can tell the
number, or the make of its teeth, or its paps, is as ab&s;urd as if we &s;hould
pretend to di&s;tingui&s;h men by the but|tons on their cloaths. Indeed it
often happens <PB N="307" REF="325"> that the quadrupede it&s;elf can be but
&s;eldom &s;een; that many of the more rare kinds do not come into Europe above
once an age, and &s;ome of them have never been able to bear the re|moval; in
&s;uch a ca&s;e, therefore, there is no other &s;ub&s;titute but a good print
of the animal to give an idea of its figure; for no de&s;cription what&s;oever
can an&s;wer this purpo&s;e &s;o well. Mr. Locke, with his u&s;ual good
&s;en&s;e, has ob|&s;erved, that a drawing of the animal, taken from the life,
is one of the be&s;t methods of advancing natural hi&s;tory; and yet, mo&s;t of
our modern &s;y|&s;tematic writers are content rather with de|&s;cribing.
De&s;criptions, no doubt, will go &s;ome way towards giving an idea of the
figure of an animal; but they are certainly much the longe&s;t way about, and,
as they are u&s;ually managed, much the mo&s;t ob&s;cure. In a drawing we can,
at a &s;ingle glance, gather more in&s;truction than by a day's painful
inve&s;tigation of me|thodical &s;y&s;tems, where we are told the pro|portions
with great exactne&s;s, and yet remain ignorant of the totality. In fact, this
method of de&s;cribing all things is a fault that has in|fected many of our
books, that treat on the meaner arts for this la&s;t age. They attempt to teach
by words what is only to be learnt by practice and in&s;pection. Mo&s;t of our
dictio|naries, <PB N="308" REF="326"> and bodies of arts and &s;ciences, are
guilty of this error. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, it be requi&s;ite to mention
the manner of making &s;hoes, it is plain that all the verbal in&s;tructions in
the world will never give an adequate idea of this humble art, or teach a man
to become a &s;hoe-maker. A day or two in a &s;hoe-maker's &s;hop will an&s;wer
the end better than a whole folio of in&s;truction, which only &s;erves to
op|pre&s;s the learner with the weight of its pre|tended importance. We have
lately &s;een a la|borious work carried on at Paris, with this only intent of
teaching all the trades by de|&s;cription; however, the de&s;ign at fir&s;t
blu&s;h &s;eems to be ill con&s;idered; and it is pro|bable that very few
advantages will be derived from &s;o laborious an undertaking. With regard to
the de&s;criptions in natural hi&s;tory, the&s;e, without all que&s;tion, under
the direction of good &s;en&s;e, are nece&s;&s;ary; but &s;till they &s;hould
be kept within proper bounds; and, where a thing may be much more ea&s;ily
&s;hewn than de&s;cribed, the exhibition &s;hould ever pre|cede the
account.</P>

<PB N="309" REF="327">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of Quadrupedes in general compared to Man.</HEAD>
<P>UPON comparing the various animals of the globe with each other, we
&s;hall find that Qua|drupedes demand the rank immediately next our&s;elves;
and, con&s;equently, come fir&s;t in con|&s;ideration. The &s;imilitude between
the &s;truc|ture of their bodies and ours, tho&s;e in&s;tincts which they enjoy
in a &s;uperior degree to the re&s;t, their con&s;tant &s;ervices, or their
uncea&s;ing ho&s;tilities, all render them the foremo&s;t objects of our
curio&s;ity, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of animated nature. The&s;e,
however, although now &s;o completely &s;ubdued, very probably, in the
beginning, were nearer upon an equality with us, and di&s;puted the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of earth. Man, while yet &s;avage him&s;elf, was but ill
qua|lified to civilize the fore&s;t. While yet naked, un|armed, and without
&s;helter, every wild bea&s;t was a formidable rival; and the de&s;truction of
&s;uch was the fir&s;t employment of heroes. But, when he began to multiply,
and arts to accumulate, he &s;oon cleared the plains of the mo&s;t noxious of
the&s;e his rivals; a part was taken under his protection and care, while the
re&s;t found a pre|carious <PB N="310" REF="328"> refuge in the burning defart,
or the howling wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>From being rivals, quadrupedes have now become the a&s;&s;i&s;tants
of man; upon them he devolves the mo&s;t laborious employments, and finds in
them patient and humble coad|jutors, ready to obey, and content with the
&s;malle&s;t retribution. It was not, however, without long and repeated
efforts that the in|dependant &s;pirit of the&s;e animals was broken; for the
&s;avage freedom, in wild animals, is ge|nerally found to pa&s;s down through
&s;everal ge|nerations before it is totally &s;ubdued. Tho&s;e cats and dogs
that are taken from a &s;tate of na|tural wildne&s;s in the fore&s;t, &s;till
tran&s;mit their fiercene&s;s to their young: and, however con|cealed in
general, it breaks out upon &s;everal occa&s;ions. Thus the a&s;&s;iduity and
application of man in bringing them up, not only alters their di&s;po&s;ition,
but their very forms; and the difference between animals in a &s;tate of nature
and dome&s;tic tamene&s;s is &s;o con&s;iderable, that Mr. Boffon has taken
this as a principal di|&s;tinction in cla&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>In taking a cur&s;ory view of the form of qua|drupedes, we may
ea&s;ily perceive that, of all the ranks of animated nature, they bear the
neare&s;t re&s;emblance to man. This &s;imilitude will be <PB N="311" REF="329"> found more &s;triking when, erecting them&s;elves on their hinder
feet, they are taught to walk forward in an upright po&s;ture. We then &s;ee
that all their extremities in a manner corre|&s;pond with ours, and pre&s;ent
us with a rude imitation of our own. In &s;ome of the ape kind the
re&s;emblance is &s;o &s;triking, that ana|tomi&s;ts are puzzled to find in
what part of the human body man's &s;uperiority con&s;i&s;ts; and &s;carce any
but the metaphy&s;ician can draw the line that ultimately divides them.</P>
<P>But, if we compare their internal &s;tructure with our own, the
likene&s;s will be found &s;till to encrea&s;e, and we &s;hall perceive many
advan|tages they enjoy in common with us, above the lower tribes of nature.
Like us, they are placed above the cla&s;s of birds, by bringing forth their
young alive; like us, they are placed above the cla&s;s of fi&s;hes, by
breathing through the lungs; like us, they are placed above the cla&s;s of
in&s;ects, by having red blood circulating through their veins; and la&s;tly,
like us, they are different from almo&s;t all the other cla&s;&s;es of animated
nature, being either wholly or partly covered with hair. Thus nearly are we
repre&s;ented in point of conformation to the cla&s;s of animals immediately
below us; and this &s;hews what little rea&s;on we have to be proud 
<PB N="312" REF="330"> of our per&s;ons alone, to the perfection of which
quadrupedes make &s;uch very near approaches.</P>
<P>The &s;imilitude of quadrupedes to man ob|tains al&s;o in the
fixedne&s;s of their nature, and their being le&s;s apt to be changed by the
in|fluence of climate or food than the lower ranks of nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xviii. p. 179.</BIBL></NOTE>. Birds are found
very apt to alter both in colour and &s;ize; fi&s;hes, likewi&s;e, &s;till
more; in&s;ects may be quickly brought to change and adapt them&s;elves to the
climate; and, if we de&s;cend to plants, which may be al|lowed to have a kind
of living exi&s;tence, their kinds may be &s;urprizingly and readily altered,
and taught to a&s;&s;ume new forms. The figure of every animal may be
con&s;idered as a kind of drapery, which it may be made to put on or off by
human a&s;&s;iduity; in man the drapery is almo&s;t invariable; in quadrupedes
it admits of &s;ome variation; and the variety may be made greater &s;till as
we de&s;cend to the inferior cla&s;&s;es of animal exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Quadrupedes, although they are thus &s;trongly marked, and in
general divided from the va|rious kinds around them, yet, &s;till &s;ome of
them are often of &s;o equivocal a nature, that it is hard to tell whether they
ought to be ranked in the quadrupede cla&s;s, or degraded to tho&s;e below 
<PB N="313" REF="331"> them. If, for in&s;tance, we were to mar&s;hal the whole
groupe of animals round man, placing the mo&s;t perfect next him, and tho&s;e
mo&s;t equivocal near the cla&s;&s;es they mo&s;t approach, we &s;hould find it
difficult, after the principal had taken their &s;tations near him, where to
place many that lie at the out-&s;kirts of this phalanx. The bat makes a near
approach to the aerial tribe, and might by &s;ome be reckoned among the birds.
The porcupine has not le&s;s preten&s;ions to that cla&s;s, being covered with
quills, and &s;hewing that birds are not the only part of nature that are
fur|ni&s;hed with &s;uch a defence. The armadilla might be referred to the
tribe of in&s;ects, or &s;nails, being, like them, covered with a &s;hell; the
&s;eal and the mor&s;e might be ranked among the fi&s;hes, like them being
furni&s;hed with fins, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly re&s;iding in the &s;ame
ele|ment. All the&s;e, the farther they recede from the human figure become
le&s;s perfect, and may be con&s;idered as the lowe&s;t kinds of that cla&s;s
to which we have referred them.</P>
<P>But, although the variety in quadrupedes is thus great, they all
&s;eem well adapted to the &s;tations in which they are placed. There is
&s;carce one of them, how rudely &s;haped &s;oever, that is not formed to enjoy
a &s;tate of happine&s;s <PB N="314" REF="332"> fitted to its nature. All its
deformities are only relative to us, but all its enjoyments are pecu|liarly its
own. We may &s;uperficially &s;uppo&s;e the Sloth, that takes up months in
climbing a &s;ingle tree, or the Mole, who&s;e eyes are too &s;mall for
di&s;tinct vi&s;ion, are wretched and helple&s;s creatures; but it is probable
that their life, with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, is a life of luxury; the
mo&s;t plea&s;ing food is ea&s;ily obtained; and, as they are abridged in one
plea&s;ure, it may be doubled in tho&s;e which remain. Qua|drupedes, and all
the lower kinds of animals, have, at wor&s;t, but the torments of immediate
evil to encounter, and this is but tran&s;ient and accidental; man has two
&s;ources of calamity, that which he fore&s;ees as well as that which he feels;
&s;o that, if his reward were to be in this life alone, then, indeed, would he
be of all beings the mo&s;t wretched.</P>
<P>The heads of quadrupedes, though differing from each other, are in
general adapted to their way of living. In &s;ome it is &s;harp, the better to
fit the animal for turning up the earth in which its food lies. In &s;ome it is
long, in order to give a greater room for the olfactory nerves, as in dogs, who
are to hunt and find out their prey by the &s;cent. In others it is &s;hort and
thick, as in the lion, to encrea&s;e the &s;trength <PB N="315" REF="333"> of
the jaw and to fit it the better for combat. In quadrupedes, that feed upon
gra&s;s, they are enabled to hold down their heads to the ground, by a &s;trong
tendinous ligament, that runs from the head to the middle of the back. This
&s;erves to rai&s;e the head, although it has been held to the ground for
&s;everal hours, without any labour, or any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the mu&s;cles
of the neck.</P>
<P>The teeth of all animals are entirely fitted to the nature of their
food. Tho&s;e of &s;uch as live upon fle&s;h differ in every re&s;pect from
&s;uch as live upon vegetables. In the latter they &s;eem entirely made for
gathering and brui&s;ing their &s;imple food, being edged before and fitted for
cutting; but broad towards the back of the jaw and fitted for pounding. In the
carnivorous kinds they are &s;harp before, and fitted rather for holding than
dividing. In the one the teeth &s;erve as grind&s;tones, in the other as
wea|pons of defence; in both, however, the &s;ur|face of tho&s;e teeth which
&s;erve for grinding are unequal; the cavities and ri&s;ings fitting tho&s;e of
the oppo&s;ite &s;o as to tally exactly when the jaws are brought together.
The&s;e inequalities better &s;erve for comminuting the food; but they become
&s;mooth with age; and, for this rea&s;on, old animals take a longer time to
chew <PB N="316" REF="334"> their food than &s;uch as are in the vigour of
life.</P>
<P>Their legs are not better fitted than their teeth to their
re&s;pective wants or enjoyments. In &s;ome they are made for &s;trength only,
and to &s;upport a va&s;t unwieldy frame, without much flexibility or beautiful
proportion. Thus the legs of the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the
&s;ea-hor&s;e, re&s;emble pillars; were they made &s;maller they would be unfit
to &s;upport the body; were they endowed with greater flexibi|lity, or
&s;wiftne&s;s, that would be needle&s;s, as they do not pur&s;ue other animals
for food; and, con&s;cious of their own &s;uperior &s;trength, there are none
that they deign to avoid. Deers, hares, and other creatures, that are to find
&s;afety only in flight, have their legs made entirely for &s;peed; they are
&s;lender and ner|vous. Were it not for this advantage, every car|nivorous
animal would &s;oon make them a prey, and their races would be entirely
extingui&s;hed. But, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of nature, the means of &s;afety
are rather &s;uperior to tho&s;e of offence: and the pur&s;uing animal mu&s;t
owe &s;ucce&s;s only to patience, per&s;everance, and indu&s;try. The feet of
&s;ome, that live upon fi&s;h alone, are made for &s;wimming. The toes of
the&s;e animals are joined together with membranes, being web-footed, 
<PB N="317" REF="335"> like a goo&s;e or a duck, by which they &s;wim with
great rapidity. Tho&s;e animals that lead a life of ho&s;tility, and live upon
others, have their feet armed with &s;harp claws, which &s;ome can &s;heath and
un&s;heath at will. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, who lead peaceful lives, have
generally hoofs, which &s;erve &s;ome as weapons of defence; and which in all
are better fitted for traver&s;ing exten&s;ive tracts of rugged coun|try, than
the claw foot of their pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach is generally proportioned to the quality of the
animal's food, or the ea&s;e with which it is obtained. In tho&s;e that live
upon fle&s;h and &s;uch nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances, it is &s;mall and
glandular, affording &s;uch juices as are be&s;t adapted to dige&s;t its
contents; their inte&s;tines al&s;o, are &s;hort and without fatne&s;s. On the
contrary, &s;uch animals as feed entirely upon vegetables have the &s;tomach
very large; and tho&s;e who chew the cud have no le&s;s than four &s;tomachs,
all which &s;erve as &s;o many la|boratories, to prepare and turn their
coar&s;e food into proper nouri&s;hment. In Africa, where the plants happen to
afford greater nou|ri&s;hment than in our temperate climates, &s;e|veral
animals, that with us have four &s;tomachs, have there but two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. However, in all animals 
<PB N="318" REF="336"> the &s;ize of the inte&s;tines are proportioned to the
nature of the food; where that is furni&s;hed in large quantities, the
&s;tomach dilates to an&s;wer the encrea&s;e. In dome&s;tic animals, that are
plentifully &s;upplied, it is large; in the wild animals, that live
precariou&s;ly, it is much more contracted, and the inte&s;tines are much
&s;horter.</P>
<P>In this manner, all animals are fitted by na|ture to fill up &s;ome
peculiar &s;tation. The greate&s;t animals are made for an inoffen&s;ive life,
to range the plains and the fore&s;t without injuring others; to live upon the
productions of the earth, the gra&s;s of the field, or the tender branches of
trees. The&s;e, &s;ecure in their own &s;trength, neither fly from any other
quadrupedes nor yet attack them: Nature, to the greate&s;t &s;trength has added
the mo&s;t gentle and harmle&s;s di&s;po&s;itions; without this, tho&s;e
enormous creatures would be more than a match for all the re&s;t of the
creation; for what deva&s;tation might not en&s;ue were the elephant, or the
rhinoceros, or the buffalo, as fierce and as mi&s;chievous as the tiger or the
rat? In order to oppo&s;e the&s;e larger animals, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to
prevent their exuberance, there is a &s;pecies of the carnivorous kind, of
inferior &s;trength indeed, but of greater activity and cunning. The lion and
the tiger generally <PB N="319" REF="337"> watch for the larger kinds of prey,
attack them at &s;ome di&s;advantage, and commonly jump upon them by
&s;urprize. None of the carnivorous kinds, except the dog alone, will make a
vo|luntary attack, but with the odds on their &s;ide. They are all cowards by
nature, and u&s;ually catch their prey by a bound from &s;ome lurking place,
&s;eldom attempting to invade them openly; for the larger bea&s;ts are too
powerful for them, and the &s;maller too &s;wift.</P>
<P>A lion does not willingly attack an hor&s;e; and then only when
compelled by the keene&s;t hunger. The combats between a lion and a hor&s;e are
frequent enough in Italy; where they are both inclo&s;ed in a kind of
amphi|theatre, fitted for that purpo&s;e. The lion always approaches wheeling
about, while the hor&s;e pre&s;ents his hinder parts to the enemy. The lion in
this manner goes round and round, &s;till narrowing his circle, till he comes
to the proper di&s;tance to make his &s;pring; ju&s;t at the time the lion
&s;prings, the hor&s;e la&s;hes with both legs from behind, and, in general,
the odds are in his favour; it more often happening that the lion is &s;tunned,
and &s;truck motionle&s;s by the blow, than that he effects his jump between
the hor&s;e's &s;houlders. If the lion is &s;tunned, and left &s;prawling, the 
<PB N="320" REF="338"> hor&s;e e&s;capes, without attempting to improve his
victory; but if the lion &s;ucceeds, he &s;ticks to his prey, and tears the
hor&s;e in pieces in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>But it is not among the larger animals of the fore&s;t alone, that
the&s;e ho&s;tilities are carried on; there is a minuter, and a &s;till more
treacherous conte&s;t between the lower ranks of quadrupedes. The panther hunts
for the &s;heep and the goat; the catamountain, for the hare or the rabbit; and
the wild cat, for the &s;quirrel or the mou&s;e. In proportion as each
carnivorous animal wants &s;trength, it u&s;es all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
patience, a&s;&s;iduity, and cunning. However, the arts of the&s;e to pur&s;ue,
are not &s;o great as the tricks of their prey to e&s;cape; &s;o that the power
of de|&s;truction in one cla&s;s, is inferior to the power of &s;afety in the
other. Were this otherwi&s;e, the fore&s;t would &s;oon be di&s;peopled of the
feebler races of animals; and bea&s;ts of prey them&s;elves, would want, at one
time, that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which they lavi&s;hly de&s;troyed at another.</P>
<P>Few wild animals &s;eek their prey in the day|time; they are then
generally deterred by their fears of man in the inhabited countries, and by the
exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un in tho&s;e exten&s;ive fore&s;ts that lie
towards the &s;outh, and in which <PB N="321" REF="339"> they reign the
undi&s;puted tyrants. As &s;oon as the morning, therefore, appears, the
carnivorous animals retire to their dens; and the elephant, the hor&s;e, the
deer, and all the hare kinds, tho&s;e inoffen&s;ive tenants of the plain, make
their appearance. But again, at night-fall, the &s;tate of ho&s;tility begins:
the whole fore&s;t then echoes to a variety of different howlings. Nothing
&s;ure can be more terrible than an African land|&s;cape at the clo&s;e of
evening: the deep toned roarings of the lion; the &s;hriller yellings of the
tyger; the jackall, pur&s;uing by the &s;cent, and barking like a dog; the
hyaena, with a note pe|culiarly &s;olitary and dreadful; but to crown all, the
hi&s;&s;ing of the various kinds of &s;erpents, that at that time begin their
call, and, as I am a&s;&s;ured, make a much louder &s;ymphony than the birds in
our groves in a morning.</P>
<P>Bea&s;ts of prey &s;eldom devour each other; nor can any thing but
the greate&s;t degree of hunger induce them to it. What they chiefly &s;eek
after, is the deer, or the goat; tho&s;e harm|le&s;s creatures, that &s;eem
made to embelli&s;h nature. The&s;e are either pur&s;ued or &s;urprized, and
afford the mo&s;t agreeable repa&s;t to their de&s;troyers. The mo&s;t u&s;ual
method with even the fierce&s;t animals, is to hide and crouch near &s;ome path
frequented by their prey; or &s;ome <PB N="322" REF="340"> water, where cattle
come to drink; and &s;eize them at once with a bound. The lion and the tyger
leap twenty feet at a &s;pring; and this, rather than their &s;wiftne&s;s or
&s;trength, is what they have mo&s;t to depend upon for a &s;upply. There is
&s;carce one of the deer or hare kind, that is not very ea&s;ily capable of
e&s;caping them by its &s;wiftne&s;s; &s;o that whenever any of the&s;e fall a
prey, it mu&s;t be owing to their own in|attention.</P>
<P>But there is another cla&s;s of the carnivorous kind, that hunt by
the &s;cent, and which it is much more difficult to e&s;cape. It is remarkable,
that all animals of this kind pur&s;ue in a pack; and encourage each other by
their mutual cries. The jackall, the &s;yagu&s;h, the wolf, and the dog, are of
this kind: they pur&s;ue with patience rather than &s;wiftne&s;s; their prey
flies at fir&s;t, and leaves them for miles behind; but they keep on with a
con&s;tant &s;teady pace, and excite each other by a general &s;pirit of
indu&s;try and emulation, till at la&s;t they &s;hare the common plunder. But
it too often happens, that the larger bea&s;ts of prey, when they hear a cry of
this kind begun, pur&s;ue the pack, and when they have hunted down the animal,
come in and monopolize the &s;poil. This has given ri&s;e to the report of the
jackall's being the lion's <PB N="323" REF="341"> provider; when the reality
is, that the jackall hunts for it&s;elf, and the lion is an unwelcome intruder
upon the fruits of his toil.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, with all the powers which car|nivorous animals are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, they gene|rally lead a life of famine and fatigue. Their
prey has &s;uch a variety of methods for e&s;caping, that they &s;ometimes
continue without food for a fortnight together: but nature has endowed them
with a degree of patience, equal to the &s;everity of their &s;tate; &s;o that
as their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is precarious, their appetites are complying. They
u&s;ually &s;eize their prey with a roar, either of &s;eeming delight, or
perhaps to terrify it from re&s;i&s;tance. They frequently devour it, bones and
all, in the mo&s;t ravenous manner; and then retire to their dens, continuing
in|active till the calls of hunger again excite their courage and indu&s;try.
But as all their me|thods of pur&s;uit are counteracted by the arts of
eva&s;ion, they often continue to range with|out &s;ucce&s;s, &s;upporting a
&s;tate of famine for &s;everal days, nay, &s;ometimes, weeks together. Of
their prey, &s;ome find protection in holes, in which nature has directed them
to bury them|&s;elves; &s;ome find &s;afety by &s;wiftne&s;s; and &s;uch as are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither of the&s;e advantages, generally herd together,
and endeavour to repel <PB N="324" REF="342"> inva&s;ion by united force. The
very &s;heep, which to us &s;eem &s;o defencele&s;s, are by no means &s;o in a
&s;tate of nature; they are furni&s;hed with arms of defence, and a very great
degree of &s;wiftne&s;s; but they are &s;till further a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their
&s;pirit of mutual defence: the females fall into the center; and the males,
forming a ring round them, oppo&s;e their horns to the a&s;&s;ailants. Some
animals, that feed upon fruits which are to be found only at one time of the
year, fill their holes with &s;everal &s;orts of plants, which enable them to
lie concealed during the hard fro&s;ts of the winter, contented with their
pri&s;on, &s;ince it affords them plenty and pro|tection. The&s;e holes are dug
with &s;o much art, that there &s;eems the de&s;ign of an architect in the
formation. There are u&s;ually two aper|tures, by one of which the little
inhabitant can always e&s;cape, when the enemy is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
other. Many creatures are equally care|ful of avoiding their enemies, by
placing a cen|tinel, to warn them of the approach of danger. The&s;e generally
perform this duty by turns; and they know how to puni&s;h &s;uch as have
neg|lected their po&s;t, or have been unmindful of the common &s;afety. Such
are a part of the efforts that the weaker races of quadrupedes exert, to avoid
their invaders; and, in general, they are <PB N="325" REF="343"> attended with
&s;ucce&s;s. The arts of in&s;tinct are mo&s;t commonly found an overmatch for
the in|va&s;ions of in&s;tinct. Man is the only creature again&s;t whom all
their little tricks can &s;carce prevail. Wherever he has &s;pread his
dominion, &s;carce any flight can &s;ave, or any retreat har|bour; wherever he
comes, terror &s;eems to fol|low, and all &s;ociety cea&s;es among the inferior
tenants of the plain; their union again&s;t him can yield them no protection,
and their cunning is but weakne&s;s. In their fellow brutes, they have an enemy
whom they can oppo&s;e with an equality of advantage; they can oppo&s;e fraud
or &s;wiftne&s;s to force; or numbers to inva&s;ion: but what can be done
again&s;t &s;uch an enemy as man, who finds them out though un&s;een, and
though remote de&s;troys them? Wherever he comes, all the conte&s;t among the
meaner ranks &s;eem to be at an end, or is carried on only by &s;urprize. Such
as he has thought proper to protect, have calmly &s;ubmitted to his protection;
&s;uch as he has found it convenient to de&s;troy, carry on an unequal war, and
their numbers are every day decrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The wild animal is &s;ubject to few alterations; and, in a &s;tate
of &s;avage nature, continues for ages the &s;ame, in &s;ize, &s;hape, and
colour. But it is otherwi&s;e when &s;ubdued, and taken <PB N="326" REF="344">
under the protection of man; its external form, and even its internal
&s;tructure, are altered by human a&s;&s;iduity: and this is one of the fir&s;t
and greate&s;t cau&s;es of the variety that we &s;ee among the &s;everal
quadrupedes of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Man appears to have changed the very
nature of dome&s;tic animals, by cultivation and care. A dome&s;tic animal is a
&s;lave that &s;eems to have few other de&s;ires but &s;uch as man is willing
to allow it. Humble, patient, re&s;igned, and at|tentive, it fills up the
duties of its &s;tation; ready for labour, and content with
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all dome&s;tic animals &s;eem to bear the marks of
&s;ervitude &s;trong upon them. All the varieties in their colour, all the
finene&s;s and length of their hair, together with the depending length of
their ears, &s;eem to have ari&s;en from a long continuance of dome&s;tic
&s;lavery. What an immen&s;e variety is there to be found in the ordinary race
of dogs and hor&s;es! the principal differences of which has been effected by
the indu&s;try of man, &s;o adapting the food, the treat|ment, the labour, and
the climate, that nature &s;eems almo&s;t to have forgotten her original
de|&s;ign; and the tame animal no longer bears any re&s;emblance to its
ance&s;tors in the woods around him.</P>
<P>In this manner, nature is under a kind of <PB N="327" REF="345">
con&s;traint, in tho&s;e animals we have taught to live in a &s;tate of
&s;ervitude near us. The &s;avage animals pre&s;erve the marks of their fir&s;t
for|mation; their colours are generally the &s;ame; a rough du&s;ky brown, or a
tawny, &s;eem almo&s;t their only varieties. But it is otherwi&s;e in the tame;
their colours are various, and their forms different from each other. The
nature of the climate, indeed, operates upon all; but more particularly on
the&s;e. That nouri&s;hment which is prepared by the hand of man, cho&s;en not
to their appetites, but to &s;uit his own convenience, that climate the rigours
of which he can &s;often, and that employment to which they are &s;ometimes
a&s;&s;igned, produce a number of di|&s;tinctions that are not to be found
among the &s;avage animals. The&s;e at fir&s;t were accidental, but in time
became hereditary; and a new race of artificial mon&s;ters are propagated,
rather to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of human plea&s;ure, than their own
convenience. In &s;hort, their very appetites may be changed; and tho&s;e that
feed only upon gra&s;s, may be rendered carnivorous. I have &s;een a &s;heep
that would eat fle&s;h, and an hor&s;e that was fond of oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>But not their appetites, or their figure alone, but their very
di&s;po&s;itions, and their natural &s;agacity, are altered by the vicinity of
man. <PB N="328" REF="346"> In tho&s;e countries where men have &s;eldom
in|truded, &s;ome animals have been found, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in a kind of civil
&s;tate of &s;ociety. Re|mote from the tyranny of man, they &s;eem to have a
&s;pirit of mutual benevolence, and mu|tual friend&s;hip. The beavers, in
the&s;e di&s;tant &s;olitudes, are known to build like architects, and rule
like citizens. The habitations that the&s;e have been &s;een to erect, exceed
the hou&s;es of the human inhabitants of the &s;ame country, both in neatne&s;s
and convenience. But as &s;oon as man intrudes upon their &s;ociety, they
&s;eem impre&s;&s;ed with the terrors of their inferior &s;ituation, their
&s;pirit of &s;ociety cea&s;es, the bond is di&s;&s;olved, and every animal
looks for &s;afety in &s;olitude, and there tries all its little indu&s;try to
&s;hift only for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Next to human influence, the climate &s;eems to have the
&s;tronge&s;t effects both upon the na|ture and the form of quadrupedes. As in
man, we have &s;een &s;ome alterations, produced by the variety of his
&s;ituation; &s;o in the lower ranks, that are more &s;ubject to variation, the
influence of climate is more readily perceived. As the&s;e are more nearly
attached to the earth, and in a manner connected to the &s;oil; as they have
none of the arts of &s;hielding off the inclemency of the weather, or
&s;oftening the rigours of the <PB N="329" REF="347"> &s;un, they are
con&s;equently more changed by its variations. In general, it may be remarked,
that the colder the country, the larger and the warmer is the fur of each
animal; it being wi&s;ely provided by nature, that the inhabitant &s;hould be
adapted to the rigours of its &s;ituation. Thus the fox and wolf, which in
temperate climates have but &s;hort hair, have a fine long fur in the frozen
regions near the pole. On the contrary, tho&s;e dogs which with us have long
hair, when carried to Guinea, or Angola, in a &s;hort time ca&s;t their thick
covering, and a&s;&s;ume a lighter dre&s;s, and one more adapted to the warmth
of the country. The beaver, and the ermine, which are found in the greate&s;t
plenty in the cold regions, are remarkable for the warmth and delicacy of their
furs; while the elephant, and the rhinoceros, that are natives of the line,
have &s;carce any hair at all. Not but that human indu&s;try can, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, co-operate with, or repre&s;s the effects of climate in this
particular. It is well known what al|terations are produced by proper care, in
the &s;heep's fleece, in different parts of our own country; and the &s;ame
indu&s;try is pur&s;ued with a like &s;ucce&s;s in Syria, where many of their
animals are cloathed with a long and beautiful hair, which they take care to
improve, as they <PB N="330" REF="348"> work it into that &s;tuff called
camblet, &s;o well known in different parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the animal &s;eems al&s;o not le&s;s marked
by the climate than the figure. The &s;ame cau&s;es that &s;eem to have
rendered the human inhabitants of the rigorous climates &s;avage and ignorant,
have al&s;o operated upon their animals. Both at the line and the pole, the
wild quadrupedes are fierce and untame|able. In the&s;e latitudes, their
&s;avage di&s;po|&s;itions having not been quelled by any efforts from man, and
being &s;till farther &s;timulated by the &s;everity of the weather, they
continue fierce and untractable. Mo&s;t of the attempts which have hitherto
been made to tame the wild bea&s;ts brought home from the pole or the equator,
have proved ineffectual. They are gentle and harmle&s;s enough while young; but
as they grow up, they acquire their natural ferocity, and &s;nap at the hand
that feeds them. It may indeed, in general, be a&s;&s;erted, that in all
countries where the men are mo&s;t barbarous, the bea&s;ts are mo&s;t fierce
and cruel: and this is but a natural con&s;equence of the &s;truggle be|tween
man and the more &s;avage animals of the fore&s;t; for in proportion as he is
weak and timid, they mu&s;t be bold and intru&s;ive; in pro|portion as his
dominion is but feebly &s;upported, <PB N="331" REF="349"> their rapacity
mu&s;t be more obnoxious. In the exten&s;ive countries, therefore, lying round
the pole, or beneath the line, the quadrupedes are fierce and formidable.
Africa has ever been remarked for the brutality of its men, and the
fiercene&s;s of its animals: its lions and its leo|pards are not le&s;s
terrible than its crocodiles and its &s;erpents; their di&s;po&s;itions &s;eem
entirely marked with the rigours of the climate; and being bred in an extreme
of heat, they &s;hew a peculiar ferocity, that neither the force of man can
conquer, nor his arts allay. However, it is happy for the wretched inhabitants
of tho&s;e climates, that its mo&s;t formidable animals are all &s;olitary
ones; that they have not learnt the art of uniting, to oppre&s;s mankind; but
each depending on its own &s;trength, invades without any a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>The food al&s;o is another cau&s;e in the variety, which we find
among quadrupedes of the &s;ame kind. Thus the bea&s;ts which feed in the
valley are generally larger than tho&s;e which glean a &s;canty
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the mountain. Such as live in the warm climates, where the
plants are much larger and more &s;ucculent than with us, are equally
remarkable for their bulk. The ox fed in the plains of Indo&s;tan, is very much
larger than that which is more hardily main|tained <PB N="332" REF="350"> on
the &s;ide of the Alps. The de&s;erts of Africa, where the plants are extremely
nouri&s;h|ing, produce the large&s;t and fierce&s;t animals; and perhaps, for a
contrary rea&s;on, America is found not to produce &s;uch large animals as are
&s;een in the ancient continent. But, what|ever be the rea&s;on, the fact is
certain, that while America exceeds us in the &s;ize of its rep|tiles of all
kinds, it is far inferior in its qua|drupede productions. Thus, for in&s;tance,
the large&s;t animal of that country is the tapir, which can by no means be
compared to the elephant of Africa. Its bea&s;ts of prey al&s;o, are dive&s;ted
of that &s;trength and courage which is &s;o dangerous in this part of the
world. The American lion, tyger, and leopard, if &s;uch di|minutive creatures
de&s;erve the&s;e names, are neither &s;o fierce nor &s;o valiant as tho&s;e of
Africa and A&s;ia. The tyger of Bengal has been &s;een to mea&s;ure twelve feet
in length, without in|cluding the tail; whereas the American tyger &s;eldom
exceeds three. This difference obtains &s;till more in the other animals of
that country, &s;o that &s;ome have been of opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE> that all quadrupedes in Southern
America are of a dif|ferent &s;pecies from tho&s;e mo&s;t re&s;embling them in
the old world; and that there are none <PB N="333" REF="351"> which are common
to both but &s;uch as have entered America by the north; and which, being able
to bear the rigours of the frozen pole, have travelled from the ancient
continent, by that pa&s;&s;age, into the new. Thus the bear, the wolf, the elk,
the &s;tag, the fox, and the beaver, are known to the inhabitants as well of
North America as of Ru&s;&s;ia; while mo&s;t of the various kinds to the
&s;outhward, in both continents, bear no re&s;emblance to each other. Upon the
whole, &s;uch as peculiarly belong to the new continent are without any marks
of the quadrupede perfection. They are almo&s;t wholly de&s;titute of the power
of defence; they have neither formidable teeth, horns, or tail; their figure is
ungainly, and their limbs ill proportioned. Some among them, &s;uch as the ant,
bear, and the &s;loth, appear &s;o mi&s;erably formed as &s;carce to have the
power of moving and eating. They, &s;eemingly, drag out a mi|&s;erable and
languid exi&s;tence in the mo&s;t de|&s;ert &s;olitude; and would quickly have
been de|&s;troyed in a country where there were inhabit|ants, or powerful
bea&s;ts to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>But, if the quadrupedes of the new conti|nent be le&s;s, they are
found in much greater abundance; for it is a rule that obtains through nature,
that the &s;malle&s;t animals multiply the <PB N="334" REF="352"> fa&s;te&s;t.
The goat, imported from Europe to South America, &s;oon begins to degenerate;
but as it grows le&s;s it becomes more prolific; and, in&s;tead of one kid at a
time, or two at the mo&s;t, it generally produces five, and &s;ome|times more.
What there is in the food, or the climate, that produces this change, we have
not been able to learn; we might be apt to a&s;cribe it to the heat, but that
on the African coa&s;t, where it is &s;till hotter, this rule does not obtain;
for the goat, in&s;tead of degenerating there, &s;eems rather to improve.</P>
<P>However, the rule is general among all qua|drupedes, that tho&s;e
which are large and for|midable produce but few at a time; while &s;uch as are
mean and contemptible are extremely prolific. The lion, or tyger, have &s;eldom
above two cubs at a litter; while the cat, that is of a &s;imilar nature, is
u&s;ually &s;een to have five or &s;ix. In this manner, the lower tribes become
extremely numerous; and, but for this &s;ur|prizing fecundity, from their
natural weak|ne&s;s, they would quickly be extirpated. The breed of mice, for
in&s;tance, would have long &s;ince been blotted from the earth, were the
mou&s;e as &s;low in production as the elephant. But it has been wi&s;ely
provided that &s;uch ani|mals as can make but little re&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould 
<PB N="335" REF="353"> at lea&s;t have a means of repairing the de&s;truc|tion,
which they mu&s;t often &s;uffer, by their quick reproduction; that they
&s;hould encrea&s;e even among enemies, and multiply under the hand of the
de&s;troyer. On the other hand, it has as wi&s;ely been ordered by Providence,
that the larger kinds &s;hould produce but &s;lowly; otherwi&s;e, as they
require proportional &s;up|plies from nature, they would quickly con&s;ume
their own &s;tores; and, of con&s;equence, many of them would &s;oon peri&s;h
through want; &s;o that life would thus be given without the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In a word, Pro|vidence has mo&s;t wi&s;ely
ballanced the &s;trength of the great again&s;t the weakne&s;s of the little.
Since it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be great and others mean,
&s;ince it was expedient that &s;ome &s;hould live upon others, it has
a&s;&s;i&s;ted the weakne&s;s of one by granting it fruitfulne&s;s; and
dimini&s;hed the numbers of the other by in|fecundity.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this provi&s;ion, the larger creatures, which
bring forth few at a time, &s;el|dom begin to generate till they have nearly
ac|quired their full growth. On the contrary, tho&s;e which bring many,
reproduce before they have arrived at half their natural &s;ize. Thus the
hor&s;e and the bull are nearly at their be&s;t <PB N="336" REF="354"> before
they begin to breed; the hog and the rabbit &s;carce leave the teat before they
become parents in turn. Almo&s;t all animals likewi&s;e continue the time of
their pregnancy in pro|portion to their &s;ize. The mare continues eleven
months with foal, the cow nine, the wolf five, and the bitch nine weeks. In
all, the intermediate litters are the mo&s;t fruitful; the fir&s;t and the
la&s;t generally producing the fewe&s;t in number and the wor&s;t of the
kind.</P>
<P>Whatever be the natural di&s;po&s;ition of ani|mals at other times,
they all acquire new cou|rage when they con&s;ider them&s;elves as defend|ing
their young. No terrors can then drive them from the po&s;t of duty; the
milde&s;t begin to exert their little force, and re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t
formidable enemy. Where re&s;i&s;tance is hope|le&s;s, they then incur every
danger, in order to re&s;cue their young by flight, and retard their own
expedition by providing for their little ones. When the female opo&s;&s;um, an
animal of America, is pur&s;ued, &s;he in&s;tantly takes her young into a
fal&s;e belly, with which nature has &s;upplied her, and carries them off, or
dies in the endeavour. I have been lately a&s;&s;ured of a &s;he-fox which,
when hunted, took her cub in her mouth, and run for &s;everal miles without
quit|ting it, until at la&s;t &s;he was forced to leave it 
<PB N="337" REF="355"> behind, upon the approach of a ma&s;tiff, as &s;he ran
through a farmer's yard. But, if at this period the milde&s;t animals acquire
new fiercene&s;s, how formidable mu&s;t tho&s;e be that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by
rapine! At &s;uch times, no ob&s;tacles can &s;top their ravage, nor no threats
can ter|rify; the lione&s;s then &s;eems more hardy than even the lion
him&s;elf. She attacks men and bea&s;ts indi&s;criminately, and carries all
&s;he can overcome reeking to her cubs, whom &s;he thus early accu&s;toms to
&s;laughter. Milk, in the carnivorous animals, is much more &s;paring than in
others; and it may be for this rea&s;on that all &s;uch carry home their prey
alive, that, in feeding their young, its blood may &s;upply the deficiencies of
nature, and &s;erve in&s;tead of that milk, with which they are &s;o
&s;paringly &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Nature, that has thus given them courage to defend their young, has
given them in&s;tinct to chu&s;e the proper times of copulation, &s;o as to
bring forth when the provi&s;ion &s;uited to each kind is to be found in the
greate&s;t plenty. The wolf, for in&s;tance, couples in December, &s;o that the
time of pregnancy continuing five months it may have its young in April. The
mare, who goes eleven months, admits the hor&s;e in &s;ummer, in order to foal
about the <PB N="338" REF="356"> beginning of May. On the contrary, tho&s;e
animals which lay up provi&s;ions for the winter, &s;uch as the beaver and the
marmotte, couple in the latter end of autumn, &s;o as to have their young about
January, again&s;t which &s;ea&s;on they have provided a very comfortable
&s;tore. The&s;e &s;ea&s;ons for coupling however, among &s;ome of the
dome&s;tic kinds, are generally in con&s;e|quence of the quantity of
provi&s;ions with which they are at any time &s;upplied. Thus we may, by
feeding any of the&s;e animals, and keeping off the rigour of the climate, make
them breed whenever we plea&s;e. In this manner tho&s;e contrive who produce
lambs all the year round.</P>
<P>The choice of &s;ituation in bringing forth is al&s;o very
remarkable. In mo&s;t of the rapacious kinds, the female takes the utmo&s;t
precautions to hide the place of her retreat from the male; who otherwi&s;e,
when pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, would be apt to devour her cubs. She &s;eldom,
there|fore, &s;trays far from the den, and never ap|proaches it while he is in
view, nor vi&s;its him again till her young are capable of providing for
them&s;elves. Such animals as are of tender con&s;titutions take the utmo&s;t
care to provide a place of warmth as well as &s;afety, for their young; the
rapacious kinds bring forth in the thicke&s;t woods; tho&s;e that chew the cud,
with <PB N="339" REF="357"> the various tribes of the vermin kind, choo&s;e
&s;ome hiding place in the neighbourhood of man. Some dig holes in the ground;
&s;ome choo&s;e the hollow of a tree; and all the am|phibious kinds bring up
their young near the water, and accu&s;tom them betimes to their proper
element.</P>
<P>Thus Nature &s;eems kindly careful for the protection of the
meane&s;t of her creatures: but there is one cla&s;s of quadrupedes that
&s;eems entirely left to chance, that no parent &s;tands forth to protect, nor
no in&s;tructor leads, to teach the arts of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The&s;e are the
quadrupedes that are brought forth from the egg, &s;uch as the lizard, the
tortoi&s;e, and the cro|codile. The fecundity of all other animals com|pared
with the&s;e is &s;terility it&s;elf. The&s;e bring forth above two hundred at
a time; but, as the offspring is more numerous, the parental care is le&s;s
exerted. Thus the numerous brood of eggs are, without farther &s;olicitude,
bu|ried in the warm &s;ands of the &s;hore, and the heat of the &s;un alone is
left to bring them to perfection. To this perfection they arrive al|mo&s;t as
&s;oon as di&s;engaged from the &s;hell. Mo&s;t of them, without any other
guide than in&s;tinct, immediately make to the water. In their pa&s;&s;age
thither, they have numberle&s;s <PB N="340" REF="358"> enemies to fear. The
birds of prey that haunt the &s;hore, the bea&s;ts that accidentally come that
way, and even the animals them&s;elves that give them birth are known, with a
&s;trange rapacity, to thin their numbers as well as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But it is kindly ordered by Providence, that the&s;e animals which
are mo&s;tly noxious, &s;hould thus have many de&s;troyers; were it not for
this, by their extreme fecundity, they would &s;oon over-run the earth, and
cumber all our plains with deformity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the Hor&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it may happen
that, in a de&s;cription where it is the aim rather to in&s;ert what is not
u&s;ually known, than all that is known, &s;ome of the more obvious particulars
may be omitted; I will take leave to &s;ubjoin in the notes the
characteri&s;tic marks of each animal, as given us by Lin|naeus. The hor&s;e,
with &s;ix cutting teeth before; and &s;ingle hoofed; a native of Europe and
the Ea&s;t; (but I rather believe of Africa) a generous, proud, and &s;trong
animal; fit either for the draught, the cour&s;e, or the road; he is delighted
with woods; he takes care of his hinder parts; defends him&s;elf from the flies
with his tail; &s;cratches his fellow; defends its young; calls by neighing;
&s;leeps after night-fall; fights by kicking, and by biting al&s;o; rolls on
the ground when he &s;weats; eats the gra&s;s clo&s;er than the ox;
di&s;tributes the &s;eed by dung|ing; wants a gall bladder; never vomits; the
foal is produced with the feet &s;tretched out; he is injured by being &s;truck
on the ear; upon the &s;tiffle; by being caught by the no&s;e in barnacles; by
having his teeth rubbed with tallow; by the herb padus; by the herb phalandria;
by the cruculio; by the conops. His di&s;|ea&s;es are different in different
countries. A con&s;umption of the ethmoid bones of the no&s;e, called the
glanders, is with us the mo&s;t infectious and fatal. He eats hem|lock without
injury. The mare goes with foal 290 days. The placenta is not fixed. He
acquires the canine teeth not till the age of five years.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the hor&s;e kind de&s;erve a place next to man, in an
hi&s;tory of nature. Their <PB N="342" REF="360"> activity, their &s;trength,
their u&s;efulne&s;s, and their beauty, all contribute to render them the
principal objects of our curio&s;ity and care; a race of creatures in who&s;e
welfare we are in|tere&s;ted next to our own.</P>
<P>Of all the quadrupede animals, the hor&s;e &s;eems the mo&s;t
beautiful; the noble largene&s;s of his form, the glo&s;&s;y &s;moothne&s;s of
his &s;kin, the graceful ea&s;e of his motions, and the exact &s;ymmetry of his
&s;hape, have taught us to re|gard him as the fir&s;t, and as the mo&s;t
perfectly formed; and yet, what is extraordinary enough, if we examine him
internally, his &s;tructure will be found the mo&s;t different from that of man
of all other quadrupedes what&s;oever. As the ape approaches us the neare&s;t
in internal con|formation, &s;o the hor&s;e is the mo&s;t remote<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hi&s;toire Naturelle, Daubenton, vol. vii. p.
374.</BIBL></NOTE>; a &s;triking proof that there may be oppo&s;itions of
beauty, and that all grace is not to be referred to one &s;tandard.</P>
<P>To have an idea of this noble animal in his native &s;implicity, we
are not to look for him in the pa&s;tures, or the &s;tables, to which he has
been con&s;igned by man; but in tho&s;e wild and exten&s;ive plains where he
has been originally produced, where he ranges without controul, and riots in
all the variety of luxurious nature. <PB N="343" REF="361"> In this &s;tate of
happy independence, he di&s;|dains the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man, which only
tends to &s;ervitude. In tho&s;e boundle&s;s tracts, whether of Africa, or New
Spain, where he runs at liberty, he &s;eems no way incommoded with the
inconveniencies to which he is &s;ubject in Europe. The continual verdure of
the fields &s;upplies his wants; and the climate that never knows a winter
&s;uits his con&s;titution, which na|turally &s;eems adapted to heat. His
enemies of the fore&s;t are but few, for none but the greater kinds will
venture to attack him; any one of the&s;e he is &s;ingly able to overcome;
while at the &s;ame time he is content to find &s;afety in &s;ociety; for the
wild hor&s;es of tho&s;e countries always herd together.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries, therefore, the hor&s;es are often &s;een
feeding in droves of five or &s;ix hun|dred. As they do not carry on war
again&s;t any other race of animals, they are &s;atisfied to re|main entirely
upon the defen&s;ive. The pa|&s;tures on which they live &s;atisfy all their
appe|tites, and all other precautions are purely for their &s;ecurity, in
ca&s;e of a &s;urprize. As they are never attacked but at a di&s;advantage,
when|ever they &s;leep in the fore&s;ts, they have always one among their
number that &s;tands as centinel, <PB N="344" REF="362"> to give notice of any
approaching danger; and this office they take by turns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Univer&s;elle, Des Animaux, p.
19.</BIBL></NOTE>. If a man ap|proaches them while they are feeding by day,
their centinel walks up boldly near him, as if to examine his &s;trength, or to
intimidate him from proceeding; but, as the man approaches within pi&s;tol
&s;hot, the centinel then thinks it high time to alarm his fellows; this he
does by a loud kind of &s;norting, upon which they all take the &s;ignal, and
fly off with the &s;peed of the wind; their faithful centinel bringing up the
rear<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat. tome vii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay from what country the hor&s;e came
originally. It &s;hould &s;eem that the colder climates do not agree with his
con&s;ti|tution; for, although he is found almo&s;t in them all, yet his form
is altered there, and he is found at once diminutive and ill &s;haped. We have
the te&s;timony of the ancients that there were wild hor&s;es once in Europe;
at pre&s;ent, however, they are totally brought under &s;ubjec|tion; and even
tho&s;e which are found in Ame|rica are of a Spani&s;h breed, which being
&s;ent thither upon its fir&s;t di&s;covery, have &s;ince be|come wild, and
have &s;pread over all the &s;outh <PB N="345" REF="363"> of that va&s;t
continent, almo&s;t to the Streights of Magellan. The&s;e, in general, are a
&s;mall breed, of about fourteen hands high. They have thick jaws and clum&s;y
joints; their ears and neck al&s;o are long; they are ea&s;ily tamed; for the
hor&s;e by nature is a gentle complying creature, and re&s;i&s;ts rather from
fear than ob|&s;tinacy. They are caught by a kind of nooze, and then held
fa&s;t by the legs, and tyed to a tree, where they are left for two days,
without food or drink. By that time, they begin to grow manageable; and in
&s;ome weeks they become as tame as if they had never been in a &s;tate of
wildne&s;s. If by any accident they are once more &s;et at liberty, they never
become wild again, but know their ma&s;ters, and come to their call. Some of
the buccaneers have often been agreeably &s;urprized, after a long ab&s;ence,
to &s;ee their faithful hor&s;es once more pre&s;ent them&s;elves, with their
u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity; and come up, with fond &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to receive the
rein.</P>
<P>The&s;e American hor&s;es, however, cannot properly be ranked among
the wild races, &s;ince they were originally bred from &s;uch as were tame. It
is not in the new, but the old world that we are to look for this animal, in a
true &s;tate of nature; in the exten&s;ive de&s;erts of <PB N="346" REF="364">
Africa, in Arabia, and tho&s;e wide &s;pread coun|tries that &s;eparate Tartary
from the more &s;outhern nations. Va&s;t droves of the&s;e animals are &s;een
wild among the Tartars: they are of a &s;mall breed, extremely &s;wift, and
very readily evade their pur&s;uers. As they go together, they will not admit
of any &s;trange animals among them, though even of their own kind. Whenever
they find a tame hor&s;e attempting to a&s;&s;ociate with them, they
in&s;tantly gather round him, and &s;oon oblige him to &s;eek &s;afety by
flight. There are va&s;t numbers al&s;o of wild hor&s;es to the north of China,
but they are of a weak timid breed; &s;mall of &s;tature and u&s;ele&s;s in
war.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope al&s;o there are numbers of hor&s;es, in a
&s;tate of nature, but &s;mall, vicious, and untameable. They are found wild
al&s;o in &s;everal other parts of Africa; but the wretched inhabitants of that
country either want the art to tame them, or &s;eem ig|norant of their u&s;es.
It is common with the Negroes, who are carried over from thence to America,
when they fir&s;t &s;ee an hor&s;e, to te&s;tify both terror and &s;urprize.
The&s;e poor men &s;eem not to have any knowledge of &s;uch a crea|ture; and,
though the hor&s;e is probably a native of their own country, they have let all
the re&s;t <PB N="347" REF="365"> of mankind enjoy the benefit of his
&s;ervices, without turning them to any advantage at home. In &s;ome parts of
Africa, therefore, where the hor&s;e runs wild, the natives &s;eem to
con&s;ider him rather in the light of a dainty, for food, than a u&s;eful
creature, capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them either in war or in labour: riding
&s;eems a refinement that the natives of Angola, or Caffraria, have not as yet
been able to attain to; and whenever they catch an hor&s;e, it is only with an
intent to eat him.</P>
<P>But of all countries in the world, where the hor&s;e runs wild,
Arabia produces the mo&s;t beautiful breed, the mo&s;t generous, &s;wift, and
per&s;evering. They are found, though not in great numbers, in the de&s;erts of
that country; and the natives u&s;e every &s;tratagem to take them. Although
they are active and beautiful, yet they are not &s;o large as tho&s;e that are
bred up tame; they are of a brown colour; their mane and tail very &s;hort, and
the hair black and tufted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Marm. De&s;cript. de
l'Afrique, l. 1, p. 51.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their &s;wiftne&s;s is incredible; the
attempt to pur&s;ue them in the u&s;ual manner of the chace, with dogs, would
be entirely fruitle&s;s. Such is the rapidity of their flight, that they are
in&s;tantly out of view, and the dogs them&s;elves give up the vain pur&s;uit.
The only <PB N="348" REF="366"> method, therefore, of taking them is by traps,
hidden in the &s;and, which entangling their feet, the hunter at length comes
up, and either kills them or carries them home alive. If the hor&s;e be young,
he is con&s;idered among the Arabians as a very great delicacy; and they
fea&s;t upon him while any part is found remaining; but if, from his &s;hape or
vigour, he promi&s;es to be &s;er|viceable in his more noble capacity, they
take the u&s;ual methods of taming him, by fatigue and hunger, and he &s;oon
becomes an u&s;eful do|me&s;tic animal.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual manner of trying their &s;wiftne&s;s is by hunting the
o&s;trich: the hor&s;e is the only animal who&s;e &s;peed is comparable to that
of this creature, which is found in the &s;andy plains, with which tho&s;e
countries abound. The in&s;tant the o&s;trich perceives it&s;elf aimed at, it
makes to the mountains, while the hor&s;e|man pur&s;ues with all the
&s;wiftne&s;s po&s;&s;ible, and endeavours to cut off its retreat. The chace
then continues along the plain, while the o&s;trich makes u&s;e of both legs
and wings to a&s;&s;i&s;t its motion. However, an hor&s;e of the fir&s;t
&s;peed is able to out run it; &s;o that the poor animal is then obliged to
have recour&s;e to art to elude the hunter, by frequently turning: at length,
finding all e&s;cape hopele&s;s, it hides its head <PB N="349" REF="367">
wherever it can, and &s;uffers it&s;elf tamely to be taken. If the hor&s;e, in
a trial of this kind, &s;hews great &s;peed, and is not readily tired, his
price becomes proportionably great; and there are &s;ome hor&s;es valued at a
thou&s;and ducats.</P>
<P>But the hor&s;es thus caught, or trained in this manner, are at
pre&s;ent but very few; the value of Arabian hor&s;es, over all the world, has
in a great mea&s;ure thinned the de&s;erts of the wild breed; and there are
very few to be found in tho&s;e countries, except &s;uch as are tame. The
Arabians, as we are told by hi&s;torians, fir&s;t began the management of
hor&s;es in the time of Sheque I&s;mael. Before that they wandered wild along
the face of the country, ne|glected and u&s;ele&s;s; but the natives then
fir&s;t began to tame their fiercene&s;s, and to improve their beauty; &s;o
that at pre&s;ent they po&s;&s;e&s;s a race of the mo&s;t beautiful hor&s;es in
the whole world, with which they drive a trade, and furni&s;h the &s;tables of
princes at immen&s;e prices.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce an Arabian, how poor &s;o|ever, but is provided
with his hor&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. They, in
general, make u&s;e of mares in their ordinary excur&s;ions; experience having
taught them that they &s;upport fatigue, thir&s;t, and hunger, 
<PB N="350" REF="368"> better than the hor&s;es are found to do. They are
al&s;o le&s;s vicious, of a gentler nature, and are not &s;o apt to neigh. They
are more harm|le&s;s al&s;o among them&s;elves, not &s;o apt to kick or hurt
each other, but remain whole days to|gether without the lea&s;t mi&s;chief. The
Turks, on the contrary, are not fond of mares; and the Arabians &s;ell them
&s;uch hor&s;es as they do not chu&s;e to keep for &s;tallions at home. They
pre|&s;erve the pedigree of their hor&s;es with great care, and for &s;everal
ages back. They know their alliances and all their genealogy; they
di&s;tin|gui&s;h the races by different names, and divide them into three
cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is that of the nobles, the ancient breed, and
unadul|terated on either &s;ide: the &s;econd is that of the hor&s;es of the
ancient race, but adulterated; and the third is that of the common and inferior
kind: the la&s;t they &s;ell at a low price; but tho&s;e of the fir&s;t
cla&s;s, and even of the &s;econd, among&s;t which are found hor&s;es of equal
value to the former, are &s;old extremely dear. They know, by long experience,
the race of an hor&s;e by his appearance; they can tell the name, the
&s;urname, the colour, and the marks properly belonging to each. When they are
not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;tallions of the noble race them|&s;elves, for their
mares, they borrow from their <PB N="351" REF="369"> neighbours, paying a
proper price as with us, and receive a written atte&s;tation of the whole. In
this atte&s;tation is contained the name of the hor&s;e and the mare, and their
re&s;pective ge|nealogies. When the mare has produced her foal, new
witne&s;&s;es are called, and a new at|te&s;tation &s;igned, in which are
de&s;cribed the marks of the foal, and the day noted when it was brought forth.
The&s;e atte&s;tations encrea&s;e the value of the hor&s;e; and they are given
to the per&s;on who buys him. The mo&s;t ordinary mare of this race &s;ells for
five hundred crowns; there are many that &s;ell for a thou&s;and; and &s;ome of
the very fine&s;t kinds for fourteen or fifteen hundred pound. As the Arabians
have no other hou&s;e but a tent to live in, this al&s;o &s;erves them for a
&s;table; &s;o that the mare, the foal, the hu&s;band, the wife, and the
children, lie all together indi&s;criminately; the little chil|dren are often
&s;een upon the body, or the neck of the mare, while the&s;e continue
inoffen&s;ive and harmle&s;s, permitting them thus to play with and care&s;s
them without any injury. The Arabians never beat their hor&s;es: they treat
them gently; they &s;peak to them, and &s;eem to hold a di&s;cour&s;e; they
u&s;e them as friends; they never attempt to encrea&s;e their &s;peed by the
whip, nor &s;pur them but in ca&s;es of nece&s;|&s;ity. <PB N="352" REF="370">
However, when this happens, they &s;et off with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s; they
leap over ob|&s;tacles with as much agility as a buck; and, if the rider
happens to fall, they are &s;o manage|able that they &s;tand &s;tock &s;till in
the mid&s;t of their mo&s;t rapid career. The Arabian hor&s;es are of a middle
&s;ize, ea&s;y in their motions, and rather inclined to leanne&s;s than fat.
They are regularly dre&s;&s;ed every morning and evening, and with &s;uch care
that the &s;malle&s;t roughne&s;s is not left upon their &s;kins. They wa&s;h
the legs, the mane, and the tail, which they never cut; and which they &s;eldom
comb, left they &s;hould thin the hair. They give them nothing to eat during
the day; they only give them to drink once or twice; and at &s;un-&s;et they
hang a bag to their heads, in which there is about half a bu&s;hel of clean
barley. They continue eating the whole night, and the bag is again taken away
the next morning. They are turned out to pa&s;ture in the beginning of March,
when the gra&s;s is pretty high, and at which time the mares are given to the
&s;tallion. When the &s;pring is pa&s;t, they take them again from pa|&s;ture,
and they get neither gra&s;s nor hay during the re&s;t of the year; barley is
their only food, except now and then a little &s;traw. The mane of the foal is
always clipped off when about a <PB N="353" REF="371"> year or eighteen months
old, in order to make it &s;tronger and thicker. They begin to break them at
two years old, or two years and an half at farthe&s;t; they never &s;addle or
bridle them till at that age; and then they are always kept ready &s;addled at
the door of the tent, from morning till &s;un-&s;et, in order to be prepared
again&s;t any &s;urprize. They at pre&s;ent &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the great
advantage their hor&s;es are to the country; there is a law, therefore, that
prohibits the exportation of the mares; and &s;uch &s;tallions as are brought
into England are generally purcha&s;ed on the ea&s;tern &s;hores of Africa, and
come round to us by the Cape of Good Hope. They are in general le&s;s in
&s;ta|ture than our own, being not above fourteen, or fourteen hands and an
half high; their mo|tions are much more graceful and &s;wifter than of our own
hor&s;es; but, neverthele&s;s, their &s;peed is far from being equal; they run
higher from the ground; their &s;troke is not &s;o long and clo&s;e; and they
are far inferior in bottom. Still, however, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the
fir&s;t and fine&s;t breed in the world; and that from which all others have
derived their prin|cipal qualifications. It is even probable that Arabia is the
original country of hor&s;es; &s;ince there, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing the
breed, they take <PB N="354" REF="372"> every precaution to keep it entire. In
other countries they mu&s;t continually change the races, or their hor&s;es
would &s;oon degenerate; but there the &s;ame blood has pa&s;t down through a
long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without any dimi|nution either of force or beauty.</P>
<P>The race of Arabian hor&s;es has &s;pread it&s;elf into Barbary,
among the Moors, and has even extended acro&s;s that exten&s;ive continent to
the we&s;tern &s;hores of Africa. Among the Negroes of Gambia and Senegal, the
chiefs of the country are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hor&s;es; which, though little,
are very beautiful and extremely manageable. In&s;tead of barley they are fed,
in tho&s;e coun|tries, with maize, brui&s;ed and reduced into meal, and mixed
up with milk when they de|&s;ign to fatten them. The&s;e are con&s;idered as
next to the Arabian hor&s;es, both for &s;wiftne&s;s and beauty; but they are
rather &s;till &s;maller than the former. The Italians have a peculiar &s;port,
in which hor&s;es of this breed run again&s;t each other. They have no riders,
but &s;addles &s;o formed as to flap again&s;t the hor&s;es' &s;ides as they
move, and thus to &s;pur them forward. They are &s;et to run in a kind of
railed walk, about a mile long, out of which they never attempt to e&s;cape;
but, when they once &s;et forward, they never &s;top, although the walk from
one end <PB N="355" REF="373"> to the other is covered with a crowd of
&s;pec|tators, which opens and gives way as the hor&s;es approach. Our hor&s;es
would &s;carcely, in this manner, face a crowd, and continue their &s;peed,
without a rider, through the mid&s;t of a multi|tude; and, indeed, it is a
little &s;urprizing how in &s;uch a place the hor&s;es find their own way.
How|ever, what our Engli&s;h hor&s;es may want in &s;aga|city, they make up by
their &s;wiftne&s;s; and it has been found upon computation that their &s;peed
is nearly one fourth greater even carrying a rider than that of the
&s;wifte&s;t Barb without one.</P>
<P>The Arabian breed has been diffu&s;ed into Egypt as well as Barbary,
and into Per&s;ia al&s;o; where, as we are told by Marcus Paulus, there are
&s;tuds of ten thou&s;and white mares all together, very fleet, and with the
hoof &s;o hard that &s;hoeing is unnece&s;&s;ary. In the&s;e countries, they in
general give their hor&s;es the &s;ame treatment that they give in Arabia,
except that they litter them upon a bed of their own dung, dried in the &s;un,
and then reduced to powder. When this, which is &s;pread under the hor&s;e
about five inches thick, is moi&s;tened, they dry it again, and &s;pread it as
before. The hor&s;es of the&s;e countries a good deal re&s;emble each other.
They are u&s;ually of a &s;lender make; their legs fine, bony, and 
<PB N="356" REF="374"> far apart; a thin mane; a fine cre&s;t; a beau|tiful
head; the ear &s;mall and well pointed; the &s;houlder thin; the &s;ide
rounded, without any un&s;ightly prominence; the croup is a little of the
longe&s;t, and the tail is generally &s;et high. The race of hor&s;es, however,
is much dege|nerated in Numidia; the natives having been di&s;couraged from
keeping the breed up by the Turks, who &s;eize upon all the good hor&s;es,
with|out paying the owners the &s;malle&s;t gratuity for their care in bringing
them up. The Tingitanians and Egyptians have now, therefore, the fame of
rearing the fine&s;t hor&s;es, both for &s;ize and beauty. The &s;malle&s;t of
the&s;e la&s;t are u&s;ually &s;ixteen hands high; and all of them &s;haped, as
they expre&s;s it, with the elegance of an antelope.</P>
<P>Next to the barb, travellers generally rank the Spani&s;h genette.
The&s;e hor&s;es, like the former, are little, but extremely &s;wift and
beautiful. The head is &s;omething of the large&s;t; the mane thick; the ears
long, but well pointed; the eyes filled with fire; the &s;houlder thicki&s;h,
and the brea&s;t full and large. The croup round and large; the legs beautiful,
and without hair; the pa&s;tern a little of the longe&s;t, as in the Barb, and
the hoof rather too high. Never|thele&s;s, they move with great ea&s;e, and
carry <PB N="357" REF="375"> them&s;elves extremely well. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual
colour is black, or a dark bay. They &s;eldom or never have white legs, or
white &s;nip. The Spaniards, who have a groundle&s;s aver&s;ion to the&s;e
marks, never breed from &s;uch as have them. They are all branded on the
buttock with the owner's name; and tho&s;e of the province of Andalu&s;ia
pa&s;s for the be&s;t. The&s;e are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s courage, obedience,
grace, and &s;pirit, in a greater degree than even the Barb; and, for this
rea&s;on, they have been preferred as war hor&s;es to tho&s;e of any other
country.</P>
<P>The Italian hor&s;es were once more beautiful than they are at
pre&s;ent, for they have greatly neglected the breed. Neverthele&s;s, there are
&s;till found &s;ome beautiful hor&s;es among them, particularly among the
Neapolitans, who chiefly u&s;e them for the draught. In general, they have
large heads and thick necks. They are al&s;o re&s;tiff, and con&s;equently
unmanageable. The&s;e faults, however, are recompenced by the largene&s;s of
their &s;ize, by their &s;pirit, and the beauty of their motion. They are
excellent for &s;hew, and have a particular aptitude to prance.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h hor&s;es are of &s;uch an excellent &s;ize and &s;o
&s;trong a make, that they are pre|ferred to all others for the draught. There 
<PB N="358" REF="376"> are &s;ome of them perfectly well shaped; but this is
but &s;eldom &s;een, for in general they are found to have a thick neck, heavy
&s;houlders, long and hollow back, and a narrow croup: however, they all move
well, and are found excellent both for parade and war. They are of all colours,
and often of whim&s;ical ones, &s;ome being &s;treaked like the tyger, or
mottled like the leopard.</P>
<P>The German hor&s;es are originally from Arabian and Barbary
&s;tocks; neverthele&s;s, they appear to be &s;mall and ill &s;haped: it is
&s;aid al&s;o, that they are weak and wa&s;hy, with tender hoofs. The Hungarian
hor&s;es, on the other hand, are excellent for the draught, as well as the
&s;addle. The Hu&s;&s;ars, who u&s;e them in war, u&s;ually &s;lit their
no&s;trils; which is done, as it is &s;aid, to prevent their neighing, but,
perhaps, without any real foundation.</P>
<P>The Dutch breed is good for the draught, and is generally u&s;ed for
that purpo&s;e over Europe: the be&s;t come from the province of Friezland. The
Flanders hor&s;es are much in|ferior to the former; they have mo&s;t commonly
large heads, flat feet, and &s;wollen legs; which are an e&s;&s;ential
blemi&s;h in hor&s;es of this kind.</P>
<P>The French hor&s;es are of various kinds; but they have few that are
good. The be&s;t <PB N="359" REF="377"> hor&s;es of that country come from
Limo&s;in; they have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the Barb, and, like them, are
excellent for the chace; but they are &s;low in coming to perfection: they are
to be carefully treated while young, and mu&s;t not be backed till they are
eight years old. Normandy furni&s;hes the next be&s;t; which, though not &s;o
good for the chace, are yet better for war. In general, the French hor&s;es
have the fault of being heavy &s;houldered, which is oppo&s;ite to the fault of
the Barb, which is too thin in the &s;houlder, and is, con&s;equently, apt to
be &s;houlder-&s;lipt.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the hor&s;es mo&s;t u&s;ually known in Europe, we
pa&s;s on to tho&s;e of more di&s;tant countries, of who&s;e hor&s;es we can
only judge by report. We mentioned the wild hor&s;es of America. Such as are
tame, if we may credit the late&s;t reports<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa's Voyage, vol. i. p. 464.</BIBL></NOTE>, are
admirable. Great numbers of the&s;e are bred up to the chace, and are chiefly
kept for this purpo&s;e, particularly at Quito. The hunters, as Ulloa informs
us, are divided into two cla&s;&s;es; one part on foot, the other on
hor&s;eback: the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the footmen is to rouze the deer; and that of
the hor&s;emen, to hunt it down. They all, at break of day, repair to the place
ap|pointed, <PB N="360" REF="378"> which is generally on the &s;ummit of an
hill, with every man his greyhound. The hor&s;emen place them&s;elves on the
highe&s;t peaks; whil&s;t tho&s;e on foot range the precipices, mak|ing an
hideous noi&s;e, in order to &s;tart the deer. Thus the company extend
them&s;elves three or four leagues, or more, according to their num|bers. On
&s;tarting any game, the hor&s;e which fir&s;t perceives it, &s;ets off, and
the rider, being unable to guide or &s;top him, pur&s;ues the chace,
&s;ometimes down &s;uch a &s;teep &s;lope, that a man on foot, with the
greate&s;t care, could hardly keep his legs; from thence he flies up a
danger|ous a&s;cent, or along the &s;ide of a mountain, &s;o that a per&s;on
not u&s;ed to this exerci&s;e, would think it much &s;afer to throw him&s;elf
out of the &s;addle, than commit his life to the precipitate ardor of his
hor&s;e. The other hor&s;es, which join in the chace, do not wait for the
riders to animate them; they &s;et forward immediately upon &s;eeing another at
full &s;peed; and it be|comes prudence in the rider to give them their way, and
at the &s;ame time to let them feel the &s;pur, to carry him over the
precipices. The&s;e hor&s;es are backed and exerci&s;ed to this method of
hunting; and their u&s;ual pace is trotting.</P>
<P>There are &s;aid to be very good hor&s;es in the i&s;lands of the
Archipelago. Tho&s;e of Crete <PB N="361" REF="379"> were in great reputation
among the ancients, for their &s;wiftne&s;s and force; however, at pre|&s;ent
they are but little u&s;ed, even in the country it&s;elf, becau&s;e of the
unevenne&s;s of the ground, which is there very rocky and mountainous. The
original hor&s;es of Morocco are much &s;maller than the Arabian breed;
however, they are very &s;wift and vigorous. In Turky there are to be found
hor&s;es of almo&s;t all races; Arabians, Tartars, Hungarians, and tho&s;e
na|tural to the place. The latter are very beau|tiful and elegant; they have a
great deal of fire, &s;wiftne&s;s, and management; but they are not able to
&s;upport fatigue: they eat little; they are ea&s;ily heated; and they have
&s;kins &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that they can &s;carcely bear the rubbing of the
&s;tirrup. The Per&s;ian hor&s;es are, in ge|neral, the mo&s;t beautiful and
mo&s;t valuable of all the ea&s;t. The pa&s;tures in the plains of Media,
Per&s;epolis, Ardebil, and Derbent, are excellent for the purpo&s;e of rearing
them; and there were bred in tho&s;e places va&s;t numbers, by order of the
government of Per&s;ia, while that country was under any government. Pietro
della Valle prefers the hor&s;es of Per&s;ia to tho&s;e of Italy; and informs
us, that they are in general of a middle &s;ize; and although &s;ome are found
even of the &s;malle&s;t &s;tature, yet that does not <PB N="362" REF="380">
impair their beauty nor their &s;trength: yet, in &s;ome places, they are found
of a very good &s;ize, and as large as the Engli&s;h &s;addle-hor&s;es are
generally found to be: they have all a thin head, a fine cre&s;t, a narrow
brea&s;t, &s;mall ears well placed, the legs fine, the hoof hard, and the croup
beautiful; they are docile, &s;pi|rited, nimble, hardy, courageous, and capable
of &s;upporting a very great fatigue; they run very &s;wiftly, without being
ea&s;ily fatigued; they are &s;trong, and ea&s;ily nouri&s;hed, being only
&s;upplied with barley and chopped &s;traw; they are put to gra&s;s only for
&s;ix weeks in the &s;pring; they have always the tail at full length, and
there is no &s;uch thing as geldings among the number; they are defended from
the air, as in England, by body-cloaths; they attend them with the mo&s;t
punctual exactne&s;s; and they are rid generally in a &s;nafflle, without
&s;purs. Great numbers of the&s;e are every year tran&s;ported into Turky, but
chiefly into the Ea&s;t-Indies: however, after all, travellers agree that they
are not to be compared to the Arabian hor&s;es, either for courage, force, or
beauty; and that the latter are greatly &s;ought, even in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es of India are of a very indifferent kind, being weak and
wa&s;hy. Tho&s;e which are u&s;ed by the grandees of the country, come 
<PB N="363" REF="381"> from Per&s;ia and Arabia; they are fed with a &s;mall
quantity of hay during the day; and at night they have boiled peas, mixed with
&s;ugar and butter, in&s;tead of oats or barley: this nouri&s;hment &s;upports
them, and gives them &s;trength; otherwi&s;e, they would &s;oon &s;ink and
degenerate, the heat of the climate being again&s;t them. Tho&s;e naturally
belonging to the country, are very &s;mall and vicious. Some are &s;o very
little, that Taverner reports, that the young Mogul prince, at the age of
&s;even or eight, rode one of tho&s;e little hor&s;es, that was not much larger
than a greyhound: and it is not long &s;ince one of the&s;e was brought over
into this country, as a pre&s;ent to our Queen, that mea&s;ures no more than
nine hands high; and is not much larger than a common ma&s;tiff. It would
&s;eem, that climates exce&s;&s;ively hot, are unfavourable to this animal. In
this manner, the hor&s;es of the Gold coa&s;t, and of Guinea, are extremely
little, but very manageable. It is a common exerci&s;e with the grandees of
that country, who are excellent hor&s;emen, to dart out their lances before
them upon full gallop, and to catch them again before they come to the ground.
They have a &s;port al&s;o on hor&s;e|back, that requires great dexterity in
the rider, and a great &s;hare of activity in the hor&s;e; they 
<PB N="364" REF="382"> &s;trike off a ball, with a battledore, while they are
upon a full gallop, and pur&s;uing it, &s;trike it again before it comes to the
ground; and this they continue for a mile together, &s;triking &s;ometimes to
the right, and &s;ometimes to the left, with amazing &s;peed and agility.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es of China are as indifferent as tho&s;e of India: they
are weak, little, ill-&s;haped, and cowardly. Tho&s;e of Corea are not above
three feet high: almo&s;t all the breed there are made geldings, and are &s;o
timorous, that they can be rendered no way &s;erviceable in war; &s;o that it
may be &s;aid, that the Tartar hor&s;es were pro|perly the conquerors of China.
The&s;e, indeed, are very &s;erviceable in war; and although but of a middle
&s;ize, yet they are &s;urprizingly pa|tient, vigorous, &s;wift, and bold;
their hoofs are extremely hard, though rather too narrow; their heads are fine,
but rather too little; the neck is long and &s;tiff; the legs of the longe&s;t;
and yet, with all the&s;e faults, they are found to be an excellent breed. The
Tartars live with their hor&s;es pretty much in the &s;ame manner as the
Arabians do; they begin to back them at the age of &s;even or eight months,
placing their children upon them, who manage them even at that early age. By
this means they break them, by little and little, till at la&s;t, about the age
of <PB N="365" REF="383"> &s;ix or &s;even years, they are capable of enduring
amazing hard&s;hips. Thus they have been known to march two or three days
without once &s;topping; to continue five or &s;ix, without eating any thing
except an handful of gra&s;s at every eight hours; and, be&s;ides, to remain
without drinking, for four and twenty hours. The&s;e hor&s;es, which are &s;o
vigorous in their own country, lo&s;e all their &s;trength when they are
brought into China or the Indies; but they thrive pretty well in Per&s;ia and
Turky. The race of little Tartars towards the north, have al&s;o a breed of
little hor&s;es, which they &s;et &s;uch a value upon, that it is forbidden to
&s;ell them to &s;trangers: the&s;e hor&s;es have the very &s;ame qua|lities
with tho&s;e of the larger kind; which they probably derive from a &s;imilar
treatment. There are al&s;o &s;everal very fine hor&s;es in Circa&s;&s;ia and
Mingrelia. There are &s;ome greatly e&s;teemed in the Ukraine, in Walachia,
Poland, and Sweden; but we have no particular accounts of their ex|cellencies
or defects.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the ancients on the nature and qualities of the
hor&s;es of different countries, we learn, that the Grecian hor&s;es, and
particu|larly tho&s;e of The&s;&s;aly, had the reputation of being excellent
for war; that tho&s;e of Achaia were the large&s;t that were known; that the
mo&s;t <PB N="366" REF="384"> beautiful came from Egypt, which bred great
numbers; that the hor&s;es of Ethiopia were not in e&s;teem from the heat of
the country; that Arabia and Afric furni&s;hed very beautiful hor&s;es, and
very fit for the cour&s;e; that tho&s;e of Italy, and particularly of Apulia,
were very good; that in Sicily, Capadocia, Syria, Ar|menia, Media, and
Per&s;ia, there were excellent hor&s;es, equally e&s;teemed for their &s;peed
and vi|gour; that tho&s;e of Sardinia and Cor&s;ica, though &s;mall, were
&s;pirited and courageous; that tho&s;e of Spain re&s;embled the Parthian
hor&s;es, in being very well adapted for war; that in Walachia and
Tran&s;ylvania, there were hor&s;es with bu&s;hy tails, and manes hanging down
to the ground, which, neverthele&s;s, were extremely &s;wift and active; that
the Dani&s;h hor&s;es were good leapers; tho&s;e of Scandinavia, though little,
were well &s;haped, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great agility; that the Flanders
breed was &s;trong; that the Gauli&s;h hor&s;es were good for carrying
burthens; that the German breeds were &s;o bad, &s;o diminutive, and ill
&s;haped, that no u&s;e could be made of them; that the Swi&s;s and Hungarian
hor&s;es were good; and, la&s;tly, that tho&s;e of India were very diminutive
and feeble.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="385">Such are the different accounts we have of the
various races of hor&s;es in different parts of the world. I have hitherto
omitted making mention of one particular breed, more excellent than any that
either the ancients or moderns have produced; and that is our own. It is not
without great a&s;&s;iduity, and uncea&s;ing appli|cation, that the Engli&s;h
hor&s;es are now become &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other part of the world,
both for &s;ize, &s;trength, &s;wiftne&s;s, and beauty. It was not without
great attention, and repeated trials of all the be&s;t hor&s;es in different
parts of the world, that we have been thus &s;ucce&s;sful in improving the
breed of this animal; &s;o that the Engli&s;h hor&s;es are now capable of
performing what no others ever could attain to. By a ju|dicious mixture of the
&s;everal kinds, by the happy difference of our &s;oils, and by our &s;u|perior
&s;kill in management, we have brought this animal to its highe&s;t perfection.
An Engli&s;h hor&s;e, therefore, is now known to excel the Arabian, in &s;ize
and &s;wiftne&s;s; to be more durable than the Barb, and more hardy than the
Per&s;ian. An ordinary racer is known to go at the rate of a mile in two
minutes: and we had one in&s;tance, in the admirable Childers, of &s;till
greater rapidity. He has been frequently <PB N="368" REF="386"> known to move
above eighty-two feet and an half in a &s;econd, or almo&s;t a mile in a
minute: he has run al&s;o round the cour&s;e of New market, which is very
little le&s;s than four miles, in &s;ix minutes and forty &s;econds. But what
is &s;urpriz|ing, no other hor&s;e has been &s;ince found, that ever could
equal him; and tho&s;e of his breed have been remarkably deficient.</P>
<P>However this be, no hor&s;es can any way equal our own, either in
point of &s;wiftne&s;s or &s;trength; and the&s;e are the qualifications our
hor&s;emen &s;eem chiefly to value. For this rea|&s;on, when the French, or
other foreigners, de&s;cribe our breed, they all mention, as a fault, the
aukward and ungainly motion of our hor&s;es; they allow them to be very good
indeed, but they will not grant them an ea&s;y or an ele|gant carriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Buffon's Account of our Hor&s;es.</BIBL></NOTE>.
But the&s;e writers do not con|&s;ider that this &s;eeming want of grace is
entirely the re&s;ult of our manner of breaking them. We con&s;ult only &s;peed
and di&s;patch in this animal's motions: the French, and other na|tions, are
more anxious for parade and &s;pirit. For this rea&s;on we always throw our
hor&s;es forward, while they put them upon their haunches; we give them an
ea&s;y &s;wift gait of <PB N="369" REF="387"> going, that covers a great deal
of ground: they, on the contrary, throw them back, giving them a more &s;hewy
appearance indeed, but one infinitely le&s;s u&s;eful. The fault of our manner
of breaking is, that the hor&s;e is &s;ometimes apt to fall forward; the French
managed hor&s;e never falls before, but more u&s;ually on one &s;ide; and for
this rea&s;on, the rider wears &s;tiff boots, to guard his legs again&s;t
&s;uch accidents. However, it would be a very ea&s;y matter to give our
hor&s;es all that grace which foreigners are &s;o fond of; but it would
certainly take from their &s;wiftne&s;s and durability.</P>
<P>But in what degree of contempt &s;oever foreigners might formerly
have held our hor&s;es, they have for &s;ome time perceived their error, and
our Engli&s;h hunters are con&s;idered as the noble&s;t and the mo&s;t u&s;eful
hor&s;es in the world. Our geldings are, therefore, &s;ent over to the
continent in great numbers, and &s;ell at very great prices; as for our mares
and &s;tallions, there is a law prohibiting their exportation; and one
&s;imilar to this, obtained even as early as the times of Athel&s;tan, who
prohibited their exportation, except where de&s;igned as pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>Roger de Belegme, created earl of Shrew&s;bury <PB N="370" REF="388"> by William the Conqueror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h
Zoology, vol. i. p. 4.</BIBL> To this work I am indebted for &s;everal
particulars with regard to the native animals of this i&s;land.</NOTE>, is the
fir&s;t who is recorded to have made attempts towards the mending our native
breed. He introduced Spani&s;h &s;tallions into his e&s;tate at Powi&s;land in
Wales, from which that part of the country was for many ages after famous for a
&s;wift and generous race of hor&s;es: however, at that time, &s;trength and
&s;wiftne&s;s were more regarded than beauty; the hor&s;es &s;hapes, in time of
action, being entirely hid by a coat of armour, which the knights then
u&s;ually put upon them, either by way of ornament or defence.</P>
<P>The number of our hor&s;es, in London alone, in the time of king
Stephen, is &s;aid to have amounted to twenty thou&s;and. However, long after,
in the times of queen Elizabeth, the whole kingdom could not &s;upply two
thou&s;and hor&s;es to form our cavalry. At pre&s;ent, the former numbers
&s;eem revived; &s;o that, in the late war, we furni&s;hed out above thirteen
thou|&s;and hor&s;emen: and could, if hard pu&s;hed, &s;upply above four times
that number. How far this great encrea&s;e of hor&s;es among us may be
beneficial, or otherwi&s;e, is not the proper <PB N="371" REF="389">
bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent page to di&s;cu&s;s; but cer|tain it is, that
where hor&s;es encrea&s;e in too great a degree, men mu&s;t dimini&s;h
proportionably; as that food which goes to &s;upply the one, might very
ea&s;ily be converted into nouri&s;h|ment to &s;erve the other. But, perhaps,
it may be &s;peculating too remotely, to argue for the diminution of their
numbers upon this prin|ciple, &s;ince every manufacture we export into other
countries, takes up room, and may have occupied that place, which, in a &s;tate
of greater &s;implicity, might have given birth and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to
mankind, and have added to popu|lation.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, as we have been at &s;uch expence and trouble to
procure an excellent breed of hor&s;es, it is not now to be expected that we
&s;hould decline the advantages ari&s;ing from it, ju&s;t when in our
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It may be, therefore, the mo&s;t prudent mea&s;ure in our
legi&s;lature, to encourage the breed, as an u&s;eful branch of commerce, and a
natural de|fence to the country. But how far this end is an&s;wered by the
breeding up of racers, is what mo&s;t per&s;ons, ver&s;ed in this &s;ubject,
are very apt to que&s;tion. They a&s;&s;ert, that the running-hor&s;e, as the
breed has been for a long time re|fined, <PB N="372" REF="390"> is unfit for
any other &s;ervice than that of the cour&s;e, being too &s;light either for
the road, the chace, or the combat; and his joints &s;o de|licately united, as
to render him &s;ubject to the &s;malle&s;t accidents. They, therefore,
con|clude, that le&s;s encouragement given to racing, would be a means of
turning us from breeding rather for &s;wiftne&s;s than &s;trength; and that we
&s;hould thus be again famous for our &s;trong hunters, which they &s;ay are
wearing out from among us.</P>
<P>How far this may be fact, I will not take upon me to determine,
being but little ver&s;ed in a &s;ubject that does not properly come within the
compa&s;s of natural hi&s;tory. In&s;tead, there|fore, of farther expatiating
on this well known animal's qualifications, upon which many vo|lumes might
ea&s;ily be written, I will content my&s;elf with ju&s;t mentioning the
de&s;cription of Camerarius, in which he profe&s;&s;es to unite all the
perfections which an hor&s;e ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. 
<Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t," &s;ays he, "have three parts like
tho&s;e of a woman; the brea&s;t mu&s;t be broad, the hips round, and the mane
long: it mu&s;t, in three things re&s;emble a lion; its coun|tenance mu&s;t be
fierce, its courage mu&s;t be great, and its fury irre&s;i&s;tible: it mu&s;t

have three of a fox; ear, tail, and trot: three of a &s;erpent; memory,

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of the A&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many parts of
this account are extracted from Dau|benton and Buffon; which I mention here, to
avoid troubling the reader with a multiplicity of quotations.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH this animal is very ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the
hor&s;e at fir&s;t &s;ight, yet, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, the &s;imilitude
between them is very &s;triking. They have both a &s;imilar outline in the
external parts; the &s;ame confor|mation within. One would be led, from the
great re&s;emblance there is between them, to &s;uppo&s;e them of the &s;ame
&s;pecies; and that the a&s;s was only an hor&s;e degenerated: however, they
are perfectly di&s;tinct, and there is an in|&s;eparable line drawn between
them, for the mule they produce is barren. This &s;eems to be the barrier
between every &s;pecies of animals; this keeps them a&s;under, and pre&s;erves
the unities of their form. If the mule, or the mon&s;ter bred between two
animals who&s;e form nearly approaches, is no longer fertile, we may then
conclude, that the&s;e animals, however re&s;embling, are of different
kinds.&mdash;Nature has providently &s;topped the fruitfulne&s;s of the&s;e
ill-formed productions, in order to pre|&s;erve <PB N="375" REF="393"> the form
of every animal unconta|minated: were it not for this, the races would quickly
be mixed with each other; no one kind would pre&s;erve its original perfection;
every creature would quickly degenerate; and the world would be &s;tocked with
imperfection and deformity.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e and the a&s;s, therefore, though &s;o nearly approaching
in form, are of two di&s;tinct kinds, different in their natures; and were
there but one of each kind, both races would then be extingui&s;hed. Their
&s;hapes and their habits may, indeed, be very nearly alike; but there is
&s;omething in every animal, be&s;ide its confor|mation or way of life, that
determines its &s;pe|cific nature. Thus there is much greater re|&s;emblance
between the hor&s;e and the a&s;s, than between the &s;heep and the goat; and
yet the latter produce an animal that is by no means barren, but which quickly
re produces an off|&s;pring re&s;embling the &s;heep; while the mule of the
former is marked with certain &s;terility. The goat and the &s;heep may be
therefore &s;aid to be of one kind, although &s;o much unlike in figure; while
the hor&s;e and the a&s;s are perfectly di|&s;tinct, though &s;o clo&s;ely
re&s;embling. It has, indeed, been &s;aid by Ari&s;totle, that their male is
&s;ometimes prolific; this, however, has not <PB N="376" REF="394"> been
confirmed by any other te&s;timony, al|though there has elap&s;ed a period of
near two thou&s;and years to collect the evidence.</P>
<P>But what tends to put the &s;ubject out of di&s;|pute is, that the
two animals are found in a &s;tate of nature, entirely different. The onager,
or wild a&s;s, is &s;een in &s;till greater abundance than the wild hor&s;e;
and the peculiarities of its kind are more di&s;tinctly marked than in tho&s;e
of the tame one. Had it been an hor&s;e dege|nerated, the likene&s;s would be
&s;tronger between them, the higher we went to the original &s;tock from whence
both have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;prung. The wild animals of both kinds
would, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, re&s;emble each other, much more than tho&s;e of the
tame kind, upon whom art has, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, been
ex|erci&s;ing all its force, and producing &s;trange habits and new
alterations. The contrary how|ever obtains, and the wild a&s;s is even more
a&s;&s;inine, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, than that bred in a &s;tate of
dome&s;tic &s;ervitude; and has even a natural aver&s;ion to the hor&s;e, as
the reader will &s;hortly learn.</P>
<P>The wild a&s;s has, by &s;ome writers, been con|founded with the
zebra, but very improperly, for they are of a very different &s;pecies. The
wild a&s;s is not &s;treaked like the zebra, nor is his <PB N="377" REF="395">
&s;hape &s;o beautiful: his figure is pretty much the &s;ame as that of the
common a&s;s, except that he is of a brighter colour, and has a white li&s;t
running from his head to his tail. This animal is found wild in many i&s;lands
of the Archipelago, particularly in that of Cerigo. There are many wild
a&s;&s;es in the de&s;arts of Lybia and Numidia, that run with &s;uch amaz|ing
&s;wiftne&s;s, that &s;carce even the cour&s;ers of the country can overtake
them. When they &s;ee a man, they &s;et up an horrid braying, and &s;top
&s;hort all together, till he approaches near them; they then, as if by common
con&s;ent, fly off with great &s;peed; and it is upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions that
they generally fall into the traps which are previou&s;ly prepared to catch
them. The natives take them chiefly upon account of their fle&s;h, which they
e&s;teem as delicious eating; and for their &s;kins, of which that kind of
leather is made which is called &s;hagreen.</P>
<P>Olearius relates that the monarch of Per&s;ia invited him on a
certain day to be pre&s;ent at an entertainment of a very peculiar nature,
which was exhibited in a &s;mall building near the palace, re&s;embling a
theatre. After a col|lation of fruits and &s;weetmeats, more than thirty of
the&s;e wild a&s;&s;es were driven into the area, among which the monarch
di&s;charged <PB N="378" REF="396"> &s;everal &s;hot, and &s;ome arrows, and in
which he was imitated by &s;ome of the re&s;t of his attend|ants. The
a&s;&s;es, finding them&s;elves wounded, and no way of e&s;caping, in&s;tantly
began to at|tack each other, biting with great fiercene&s;s, and braying
terribly. In this manner they con|tinued their mutual animo&s;ity, while the
arrows were poured in from above, until they were all killed; upon which they
were ordered to be taken, and &s;ent to the king's kitchen at I&s;pahan. The
Per&s;ians e&s;teem the fle&s;h of this animal &s;o highly, that its delicacy
is even become a pro|verb among them. What may be the ta&s;te of the wild
a&s;&s;es fle&s;h, we are unable to &s;ay; but certain it is, that the fle&s;h
of the tame a&s;s is the wor&s;t that can be obtained, being dryer, more tough,
and more di&s;agreeable than even hor&s;e-fle&s;h. Galen even &s;ays that it is
very unwhol|&s;ome. Yet we &s;hould not judge ha&s;tily upon the different
ta&s;tes of different people, in the preference they give to certain meats. The
climate produces very great changes in the tenderne&s;s and the favour of
&s;everal viands: that beef, for in&s;tance, which is &s;o juicy and good in
England, is extremely tough and dry when killed under the line; on the
contrary, that pork which is with us &s;o unpalatable in &s;ummer, in the
warmer latitudes, where it is <PB N="379" REF="397"> always hotter than here,
is the fine&s;t eating they have, and much preferable to any hog's fle&s;h in
Europe.</P>
<P>The a&s;s, like the hor&s;e, was originally im|ported into America
by the Spaniards, and after|wards by other nations. That country &s;eems to
have been peculiarly favourable to this race of animals; and, where they have
run wild, they have multiplied in &s;uch numbers, that in &s;ome places they
are become a nui&s;ance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i. p.
316.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the kingdom of Quito, the owners of the grounds where
they are bred, &s;uffer all per&s;ons to take away as many as they can, on
paying a &s;mall acknowledgment, in proportion to the number of days their
&s;port la&s;ts. They catch them in the following manner. A number of per&s;ons
go on hor&s;eback, and are attended by Indians on foot: when arrived at the
proper places, they form a circle in order to drive them into &s;ome valley;
where, at full &s;peed, they throw the noo&s;e, and endeavour to halter them.
Tho&s;e creatures, finding them&s;elves inclo&s;ed, make very furious efforts
to e&s;cape; and, if only one forces his way through, they all follow with an
irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity. However, when noo&s;ed, the hunters throw them
down and &s;e|cure them with fetters, and thus leave them <PB N="380" REF="398"> till the chace is over. Then, in order to bring them away with
greater facility, they pair them with tame bea&s;ts of the &s;ame kind; but
this is not ea&s;ily performed, for they are &s;o remark|ably fierce that they
often hurt the per&s;ons who undertake to manage them. They have all the
&s;wiftne&s;s of hor&s;es, and neither declivities nor precipices can retard
their career. When attacked, they defend them&s;elves with their heels and
mouth with &s;uch activity, that, with|out flackening their pace, they often
maim their pur&s;uers. But the mo&s;t remarkable pro|perty in the&s;e creatures
is, that after carrying their fir&s;t load, their celerity leaves them, their
dangerous ferocity is loft, and they &s;oon con|tract the &s;tupid look and
dullne&s;s peculiar to the a&s;&s;inine &s;pecies. It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable,
that the&s;e creatures will not permit an hor&s;e to live among them. They
always feed together; and, if an hor&s;e happens to &s;tray into the place
where they graze, they all fall upon him; and, without giving him the liberty
of flying, they bite and kick him till they leave him dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Such is this animal in its natural &s;tate, &s;wift, fierce, and
formidable; but, in his &s;tate of tamene&s;s, the a&s;s pre&s;ents a very
different pic|ture; the moment his native liberty is repre&s;&s;ed, 
<PB N="381" REF="399"> he &s;eems entirely to give up all claims to free|dom;
and he a&s;&s;umes a patience and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion even humbler than his
&s;ituation. He is, in a &s;tate of tamene&s;s, the mo&s;t gentle and quiet of
all animals. He &s;uffers with con&s;tancy, and, perhaps, with courage, all the
ill treat|ment that cruelty and caprice are plea&s;ed to inflict. He is
temperate with regard to the quantity and the quality of his provi&s;ion. He is
contented with the mo&s;t neglected weeds; and makes his humble repa&s;t upon
what the hor&s;e and other animals leave behind. If he gives the preference to
any vegetable, it is to the plantane; for which he is often &s;een to neglect
every other herb in the pa&s;ture: but he is chiefly delicate with re&s;pect to
his water; he drinks only at the cleare&s;t brooks, and chiefly tho&s;e to
which he has been accu&s;tomed. He drinks as &s;oberly as he eats; and never,
like the hor&s;e, dips his no&s;e into the &s;tream. As he is &s;eldom
&s;addled, he frequently rolls him|&s;elf upon the gra&s;s; and lies down, for
this purpo&s;e, as often as he has an opportunity, without minding what becomes
of his burthen. He never rolls, like the hor&s;e, in the mud; he even fears to
wet his feet; and turns out of his way to avoid the dirty parts of a road.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="400">When very young, the a&s;s is &s;prightly, and
even tolerably hand&s;ome; but he &s;oon lo&s;es the&s;e qualifications, either
by age or bad treat|ment, and he becomes &s;low, &s;tupid, and head|&s;trong.
He &s;eems to &s;hew no ardour, except for the female, having been often known
to die after the covering. The &s;he-a&s;s is not le&s;s fond of her young than
the male is of her; and we are a&s;&s;ured that &s;he will cro&s;s fire and
water to protect, or rejoin it. This animal is &s;ometimes not le&s;s attached
to his owner; by whom he is too often abu&s;ed. He &s;cents him at a
di&s;tance, and di&s;tingui&s;hes him from others in a crowd; he knows the ways
he has pa&s;&s;ed and the places where he inhabits.</P>
<P>When over-loaded, the a&s;s &s;hews the inju&s;tice of his ma&s;ter,
by hanging down his head and lowering his ears; when he is too hard
pre&s;&s;ed, he opens his mouth and draws back his lips in a very
di&s;agreeable manner. If his eyes are covered, he will not &s;tir a &s;tep;
and, if he is laid down in &s;uch a manner that one eye is covered with the
gra&s;s while the other is hidden with a &s;tone, or whatever is next at hand,
he will continue fixed in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and will not &s;o much as
attempt to ri&s;e to free him&s;elf from tho&s;e &s;light impediments. He
walks, trots, <PB N="383" REF="401"> and gallops like an hor&s;e; but, although
he &s;ets out very freely at fir&s;t, yet he is &s;oon tired; and then no
beating will make him mend his pace. It is in vain that his unmerciful rider
exerts his whip or his cudgel; the poor little animal bears it all with
patience, and without a groan; and, con&s;cious of his own imbecility, does not
offer even to move.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;tupid heavine&s;s of his air, he may be
educated with as much ea&s;e as any other animal; and &s;everal have been
brought up to perform, and exhibited as a &s;hew. In general, however, the poor
animal is entirely neglected. Man de&s;pi&s;es this humble u&s;eful creature,
who&s;e efforts are exerted to plea&s;e him, and who&s;e &s;ervices are too
cheaply purcha&s;ed. The hor&s;e is the only favourite, and upon him alone all
expence and labour are be&s;towed. He is fed, attended, and &s;tabled, while
the a&s;s is abandoned to the cruelty of the lowe&s;t ru&s;tics, or even to the
&s;port of children, and, in&s;tead of gaining by the le&s;&s;ons he receives,
is always a lo&s;er. He is conducted along by blows; he is in&s;ulted by
unnece&s;&s;ary &s;tripes; he is overloaded by the lazy; and, being ge|nerally
the property of the poor, he &s;hares with them in their wants and their
di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Thus this faithful animal, which, were there no 
<PB N="384" REF="402"> hor&s;es, would be the fir&s;t of the quadrupede kind in
our e&s;teem, is now con&s;idered as no|thing; his properties and
qualifications being found in an higher degree el&s;ewhere, he is en|tirely
di&s;regarded; and, from being the &s;econd, he is degraded into one of the
mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s of the dome&s;tic quadrupedes.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, very little care has been taken to improve the
breed; it is &s;uffered to degenerate; and it is probable, that of all other
animals this alone is rendered feebler and more diminutive, by being in a
&s;tate of dome&s;tic &s;er|vitude. The hor&s;e, the cow, and the &s;heep, are
rendered larger by the a&s;&s;iduity of man; the a&s;s is &s;uffered to dwindle
every generation, and particularly in England, where it is probable that, but
for the medicinal qualities of its milk, the whole &s;pecies would have ere now
been ex|tingui&s;hed. Neverthele&s;s, we have good rea&s;ons to believe that,
were the &s;ame care be&s;towed on the a&s;s that is &s;pent upon the hor&s;e,
were the &s;ame indu&s;try u&s;ed in cro&s;&s;ing the breed and improving it,
we &s;hould &s;ee the a&s;s become from his pre&s;ent mean &s;tate, a very
portly and &s;erviceable animal; we &s;hould find him rival the hor&s;e in
&s;ome of his perfections, and exceed him in others. The a&s;s, bulk for bulk,
is &s;tronger than the hor&s;e; he is more &s;ure footed <PB N="385" REF="403">
al&s;o; and, though more &s;low in his motions, he is much le&s;s apt to
&s;tart out of the way.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, of all people in Europe, &s;eem alone to be
acquainted With the value of the a&s;s. They take all proper precautions to
improve the breed; and I have &s;een a jack-a&s;s, from that country, above
fifteen hands high. This animal, however, &s;eems originally a na|tive of
Arabia. A warm climate is known to produce the large&s;t and the be&s;t; their
&s;ize and &s;pirit decline in proportion as they advance into colder
regions.</P>
<P>Though now &s;o common in all parts of Eng|land, the a&s;s was
entirely lo&s;t among&s;t us during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Holing&s;hed
in|forms us that our land did yield no a&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol. i. p. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>. However,
there are accounts of their being common in England before that time. In
Sweden, they are at pre&s;ent a &s;ort of rarity; nor does it appear by the
la&s;t hi&s;tory of Nor|way that they have yet reached that country. It is in
the hotter climates alone that we are to look for the original of this
&s;erviceable creature. In Guinea, they are larger and more beautiful than even
the hor&s;es of the &s;ame country. In Per&s;ia, they have two kinds; one of
which is <PB N="386" REF="404"> u&s;ed for burthens, being &s;low and heavy;
the other, which is kept for the &s;addle, being &s;mooth, &s;tately, and
nimble. They are ma|naged as hor&s;es, only that the rider fits nearer the
crupper, and they are taught to amble like them. They generally cleave their
no&s;trils to give them more room for breathing, and many of the&s;e are &s;old
for forty or fifty pounds.</P>
<P>The a&s;s is a much more healthy animal than the hor&s;e, and liable
to fewer di&s;ea&s;es. Of all animals covered with hair, he is the lea&s;t
&s;ub|ject to vermin, for he has no lice, probably owing to the dryne&s;s and
the hardne&s;s of his &s;kin. Like the hor&s;e, he is three or four years in
coming to perfection; he lives till twenty or twenty-five; &s;leeps much le&s;s
than the hor&s;e; and never lies down for that purpo&s;e, unle&s;s very much
tired. The &s;he-a&s;s goes above eleven months with young, and never brings
forth more than one at a time. The mule may be engendered either between an
hor&s;e or a &s;he-a&s;s, or between a jack-a&s;s and a mare. The latter breed
is every way preferable, being larger, &s;tronger, and better &s;haped. It is
not yet well known whether the animal called the Gimerro be one of the&s;e
kinds; or, as is a&s;|&s;erted, bred between the a&s;s and the bull. While 
<PB N="387" REF="405"> naturali&s;ts affirm the impo&s;&s;ibility of this
mix|ture, the natives of the Alpine countries, where this animal is bred, as
&s;trongly in&s;i&s;t upon its reality. The common mule is very healthy, and
will live above thirty years, being found very &s;erviceable in carrying
burthens, particularly in mountainous and &s;tony places, where hor&s;es are
not &s;o &s;ure footed. The &s;ize and &s;trength of our a&s;&s;es is at
pre&s;ent greatly im|proved by the importation of Spani&s;h jack|a&s;&s;es; and
it is probable we may come in time to equal the Spaniards in breeding them,
where it is not uncommon to give fifty or &s;ixty guineas for a mule; and,
indeed, in &s;ome mountainous countries, the inhabitants cannot well do
with|out them. Their manner of going down the precipices of the Alps, or the
Andes, is very extraordinary; and with it we will conclude their hi&s;tory. In
the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, on one &s;ide, are &s;teep eminences, and, on the other,
fright|ful aby&s;&s;es; and, as they generally follow the direction of the
mountain, the road, in&s;tead of lying in a level, forms at every little
di&s;tance &s;teep declivities, of &s;everal hundred yards downward. The&s;e
can only be de&s;cended by mules; and the animal it&s;elf &s;eems &s;en&s;ible
of the danger, and the caution that is to be u&s;ed <PB N="388" REF="406"> in
&s;uch de&s;cents. When they come to the edge of one of the&s;e de&s;cents,
they &s;top of them&s;elves, without being checked by the rider; and, if he
inadvertently attempts to &s;pur them on, they continue immoveable. They &s;eem
all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them, and preparing
them&s;elves for the en|counter. They not only attentively view the road, but
tremble and &s;nort at the danger. Having prepared for the de&s;cent, they
place their fore-feet in a po&s;ture, as if they were &s;topping them&s;elves;
they then al&s;o put their hinder feet together, but a little forward, as if
they were going to lie down. In this atti|tude, having taken as it were a
&s;urvey of the road, they &s;lide down with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a meteor. In
the mean time, all the rider has to do is to keep him&s;elf fa&s;t on the
&s;addle, with|out checking the rein, for the lea&s;t motion is &s;ufficient to
di&s;order the equilibrium of the mule; in which ca&s;e they both unavoidably
peri&s;h. But their addre&s;s, in this rapid de|&s;cent, is truly wonderful;
for, in their &s;wifte&s;t motion, when they &s;eem to have lo&s;t all
go|vernment of them&s;elves, they follow exactly the different windings of the
road, as if they had previou&s;ly &s;ettled in their minds the route 
<PB N="389" REF="407"> they were to follow, and taken every precau|tion for
their &s;afety. In this journey, the na|tives, who are placed along the &s;ides
of the mountains, and hold by the roots of the trees, animate the bea&s;ts with
&s;houts, and encourage him to per&s;everance. Some mules, after being long
u&s;ed to the&s;e journeys, acquire a kind of reputation for their &s;afety and
&s;kill; and their value ri&s;es in proportion to their fame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Zebra.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but three animals of the hor&s;e kind. The hor&s;e, which
is the mo&s;t &s;tately and courageous; the a&s;s, which is the mo&s;t pa|tient
and humble; and the zebra, which is the mo&s;t beautiful, but at the &s;ame
time the wilde&s;t animal in nature. Nothing can exceed the delicate regularity
of this creature's colour, or the lu&s;trous &s;moothne&s;s of its &s;kin; but,
on the other hand, nothing can be more timid or more untameable.</P>
<P>It is chiefly a native of the &s;outhern parts of Africa; and there
are whole herds of them often &s;een feeding in tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains that
lie towards the Cape of Good Hope. How|ever, their watchfulne&s;s is &s;uch,
that they will &s;uffer nothing to come near them; and their &s;wiftne&s;s &s;o
great, that they readily leave every pur&s;uer far behind. The zebra, in
&s;hape, rather re&s;embles the mule, than the hor&s;e, or the a&s;s. It is
rather le&s;s than the former, and yet larger than the latter. Its ears are not
&s;o long as tho&s;e of the a&s;s, and yet not &s;o &s;mall as in the hor&s;e
kind. Like the a&s;s, its head is large, its back <PB N="391" REF="409">
&s;traight, its legs finely placed, and its tail tufted at the end; like the
hor&s;e, its &s;kin is &s;mooth and clo&s;e, and its hind quarters round and
fle&s;hy. But its greate&s;t beauty lies in the amazing regularity and elegance
of its colours. In the male, they are white and brown; in the female, white and
black. The&s;e colours are di&s;po&s;ed in alternate &s;tripes over the whole
body, and with &s;uch exactne&s;s and &s;ymmetry, that one would think Nature
had employed the rule and compa&s;s to paint them. The&s;e &s;tripes, which,
like &s;o many ribbands, are laid all over its body, are narrow, parallel, and
exactly &s;e|parated from each other. It is not here as in other party coloured
animals, where the tints are blended into each other; every &s;tripe here is
perfectly di&s;tinct, and pre&s;erves its colour round the body, or the limb,
without any di|minution. In this manner are the head, the body, the thighs, the
legs, and even the tail and the ears beautifully &s;treaked, &s;o that at a
little di&s;tance one would be apt to &s;uppo&s;e that the animal was
dre&s;&s;ed out by art, and not thus admirably adorned by nature.</P>
<P>In the male zebra, the head is &s;triped with fine bands of black
and white, which in a man|ner center in the forehead. The ears are va|riegated
with a white and du&s;ky brown. The <PB N="392" REF="410"> neck has broad
&s;tripes of the &s;ame dark brown running round it, leaving narrow white
&s;tripes between. The body is &s;triped al&s;o acro&s;s the back with broad
bands, leaving narrower &s;paces of white between them, and ending in points at
the &s;ides of the belly, which is white, except a black line pectinated on
each &s;ide, reaching from between the fore-legs, along the middle of the
belly, two thirds of its length. There is a line of &s;eparation between the
trunk of the body and the hinder quarters, on each &s;ide; behind which, on the
rump, is a plat of narrow &s;tripes, joined together, by a &s;tripe down the
middle, to the end of the tail. The colours are different in the female; and in
none the &s;tripes &s;eem entirely to agree in form, but in all they are
equally di&s;tinct; the hair equally &s;mooth and fine; the white &s;hining and
unmixed; and the black, or brown, thick and lu&s;trous.</P>
<P>Such is the beauty of this creature, that it &s;eems by nature
fitted to &s;atisfy the pride and the plea&s;ure of man; and formed to be taken
into his &s;ervice. Hitherto, however, it appears to have di&s;dained
&s;ervitude, and neither force nor kindne&s;s have been able to wean it from
its native independance and fe|rocity. But this wildne&s;s might, perhaps, in 
<PB N="393" REF="411"> time, be &s;urmounted; and, it is probable, the hor&s;e
and the a&s;s, when fir&s;t taken from the fore&s;t, were equally ob&s;tinate,
fierce, and un|manageable, Mr. Buffon informs us that the zebra, from which he
took his de&s;cription, could never be entirely ma&s;tered, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the efforts which were tried to tame it. They continued, indeed to mount
it, but then with &s;uch precautions as evidently &s;hewed its fiercene&s;s,
for two men were obliged to hold the reins while the third ventured upon its
back; and even then it attempted to kick whenever it perceived any per&s;on
approaching. That which is now in the Queen's menagerie, at Buckingham Gate, is
even more vicious than the former; and the keeper who &s;hews it takes care to
inform the &s;pectators of its ungovernable nature. Upon my attempting to
approach, it &s;eemed quite terrified, and was preparing to kick, appearing as
wild as if ju&s;t caught, although taken extremely young, and u&s;ed with the
utmo&s;t indulgence. Yet &s;till it is mo&s;t probable that this animal, by
time and a&s;&s;iduity, could be brought under &s;ubjection. As it re&s;embles
the hor&s;e in form, without all doubt it has a &s;imilitude of nature, and
only requires the efforts of an indu&s;trious and &s;kilful nation to be added
to the number of our do|me&s;tics. <PB N="394" REF="412"> It is not now known
what were the pains and the dangers which were fir&s;t under|gone to reclaim
the breed of hor&s;es from &s;avage ferocity; the&s;e, no doubt, made an equal
op|po&s;ition; but, by being oppo&s;ed, by an in|du&s;trious and enterprizing
race of mankind, their &s;pirit was at la&s;t &s;ubdued, and their free|dom
re&s;trained. It is otherwi&s;e with regard to the zebra; it is the native of
countries where the human inhabitants are but little rai&s;ed above the
quadrupede. The natives of Angola, or Cafraria, have no other idea of advantage
from hor&s;es but as they are good for food; neither the fine &s;tature of the
Arabian cour&s;er, nor the delicate colourings of the zebra, have any
al|lurements to a race of people who only con&s;ider the quantity of fle&s;h
and not its conformation. The delicacy of the zebra's &s;hape, or the painted
elegance of its form, are no more regarded by &s;uch, than by the lion that
makes it his prey. For this rea&s;on, therefore, the zebra may hitherto have
continued wild, becau&s;e it is the native of a country where there have been
no &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts made to reclaim it. All pur&s;uits that have been
hitherto in&s;tituted again&s;t it, were rather again&s;t its life than its
liberty; the animal has thus been long taught to con&s;ider man as its mo&s;t
mortal enemy; and <PB N="395" REF="413"> it is not to be wondered that it
refu&s;es to yield obedience where it has &s;o &s;eldom experienced mercy.
There is a kind of knowledge in all animals, that I have often con&s;idered
with amazement; which is, that they &s;eem perfectly to know their enemies, and
to avoid them. In&s;tinct, indeed, may teach the deer to fly from the lion; or
the mou&s;e to avoid the cat: but what is the principle that teaches the dog to
attack the dog-butcher wherever he &s;ees him? In China, where the killing and
dre&s;&s;ing dogs is a trade, whenever one of the&s;e people move out, all the
dogs of the village, or the &s;treet, are &s;ure to be after him. This I
&s;hould hardly have believed, but that I have &s;een more than one in&s;tance
of it among our&s;elves. I have &s;een a poor fellow who made a practice of
&s;teal|ing and killing dogs for their &s;kins, pur&s;ued hue and cry for three
or four &s;treets together, by all the bolder breed of dogs, while the weaker
flew from his pre&s;ence with affright. How the&s;e animals could thus find out
their enemy, and pur&s;ue him, appears I own unac|countable, but &s;uch is the
fact; and it not only obtains in dogs, but in &s;everal other animals, though
perhaps to a le&s;s degree. This very probably may have been, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, a <PB N="396" REF="414"> cau&s;e that has hitherto kept the zebra in
its &s;tate of natural wildne&s;s; and in which it may continue, till kinder
treatment &s;hall have re|conciled it to its pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>It is very likely, therefore, as a more civi|lized people are now
placed at the Cape of Good Hope, which is the chief place where this animal is
found, that we may have them tamed and rendered &s;erviceable. Nor is its
extraordinary beauty the only motive we have for wi&s;hing this animal among
the number of our dependents; its &s;wiftne&s;s is &s;aid to &s;urpa&s;s that
of all others; &s;o that the &s;peed of a zebra is become a proverb among the
Spaniards and Portugue&s;e. It &s;tands better upon its legs al&s;o than an
hor&s;e; and is con&s;equently &s;tronger in proportion. Thus, if by proper
care we im|proved the breed, as we have in other in|&s;tances, we &s;hould
probably in time to come have a race as large as the hor&s;e, as fleet, as
&s;trong, and much more beautiful.</P>
<P>The zebra, as was &s;aid, is chiefly a native of the Cape of Good
Hope. It is al&s;o found in the kingdom of Angola; and, as we are a&s;&s;ured
by Lopez, in &s;everal provinces al&s;o of Barbary. In tho&s;e boundle&s;s
fore&s;ts it has nothing to re|&s;train its liberty; it is too &s;hy to be
caught in <PB N="397" REF="415"> traps, and therefore &s;eldom taken alive. It
would &s;eem, therefore, that none of them have ever been brought into Europe,
that were caught &s;ufficiently young, &s;o as to be un|tinctured by their
original &s;tate of wildne&s;s. The Portugue&s;e, indeed, pretend that they
have been able to tame them, and that they have &s;ent four from Africa to
Li&s;bon, which were &s;o far brought under as to draw the king's coach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dapper.</BIBL></NOTE>; they add, that the per&s;on who
&s;ent them over, had the office of notary conferred upon him for his reward,
which was to remain to him and his po&s;terity for ever: but I do not find this
confirmed by any per&s;on who &s;ays he &s;aw them. Of tho&s;e which were
&s;ent to Bra&s;il, not one could be tamed; they would permit one man only to
approach them; they were tied up very &s;hort; and one of them, which had by
&s;ome means got loo&s;e, actually killed his groom, having bitten him to
death<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pyrard. tom. ii. p.
376.</BIBL></NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding this, I believe, were the zebra taken up
&s;uffici|ently young, and properly treated, it might be rendered as tame as
any other animal; and Me|rolla, who &s;aw many of them, a&s;&s;erts, that when
tamed, which he &s;peaks of as being common enough, they are not le&s;s
e&s;timable for their &s;wiftne&s;s than their beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="416">This animal, which is neither to be found in
Europe, A&s;ia, or America, is neverthele&s;s very ea&s;ily fed. That which
came over into Eng|land &s;ome years ago, would eat almo&s;t any thing, &s;uch
as bread, meat, and tobacco; that which is now among us, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
entirely upon hay. As it &s;o nearly re&s;embles the hor&s;e and the a&s;s in
&s;tructure, &s;o it probably brings forth annually as they do. The noi&s;e
they make is neither like that of an hor&s;e or an a&s;s, but more re&s;embling
the confu&s;ed barking of a ma&s;tiff dog. In the two which I &s;aw, there was
a circum&s;tance that &s;eems to have e&s;caped naturali&s;ts; which is, that
the &s;kin hangs loo&s;e below the jaw upon the neck, in a kind of dewlap,
which takes away much from the general beauty. But whether this be a natural or
accidental blemi&s;h, I will not take upon me to determine.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are often &s;ent as pre&s;ents to the princes of the
ea&s;t. We are told, that one of the governors of Batavia gave a zebra, which
had been &s;ent to him from Africa, to the emperor of Japan, for which he
received as an equivalent for the company, a pre&s;ent, to the value of &s;ixty
thou&s;and crowns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Navendorf.</BIBL></NOTE>.
