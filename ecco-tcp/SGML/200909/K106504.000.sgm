<Q>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, &s;aying, <Q>If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</Q></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two prophecies of our Saviour, relating to the final fall of Jeru|&s;alem, recorded by St. Luke; and the words of the text are the introduction to the fir&s;t of them: and it was at the awful moment, when going up to pre&s;ent him&s;elf a living &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of mankind, he came in &s;ight of the walls of that city, that he pronounced it. And &s;ince its terrible accompli&s;hment, no period has called the attention of mankind &s;o directly and &s;olemnly as the pre|&s;ent, to the con&s;ideration of that calamity, and of the fatal cau&s;es which led to it.</P>
<P>The people of the various kingdoms of the world, who own obedience to the law of Chri&s;t, have, for many ages, been free from the &s;courge of &s;uch utter de&s;truction; its mild influence, though it has not broken the &s;word of battle, has blunted its edge; and if ho&s;tile anger has not been di&s;armed by it, it has made ho&s;tile revenge drop the point of his &s;pear: thus the &s;tate of mankind, &s;heltered from the former &s;everity of the &s;torms which laid it wa&s;te, has in the&s;e countries been improved; and tho&s;e who had accurately marked the progre&s;s of this amelioration, flattered them&s;elves with a pro&s;pect of the &s;tability of what was gained to the general happine&s;s, and of great further acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>The melancholy experience of a brief, very brief period, has &s;hewn us, on what a quick&s;and this &s;plendid edifice of human expectation may be &s;ounded: that the acqui&s;itions of ages improving upon ages may, perhaps, be &s;uddenly cru&s;hed by one blow of the iron mace of de&s;olation; wielded by a more ferocious arm than that of ancient barbari&s;m, and lo&s;t in utter extinction. In a kingdom which has acknowledged the faith of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the tyranny of impiety has &s;hut his wor&s;hippers out of the temples dedicated to his holy name: violence has trampled upon every human in&s;titution, hitherto reverenced as augu&s;t: the lawgiver whom they have &s;et up over them&s;elves, has been compelled by the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
meane&s;t of the people, and by threats of death, to publi&s;h their will as his law. Terror and the &s;word have expelled knowledge, rank, and probity, from the &s;eat of judgement; and their place has been defiled by tho&s;e who ought to have been the victims of her keene&s;t indignation: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, derived from a long illu&s;trious line of ance&s;try, or the reward of worthy &s;ervices to the &s;tate, or acquired by the indu&s;try which at the &s;ame time has fed it; whatever a genuine, or a mi&s;taken piety, who&s;e errors virtue does not look upon without affection, had con&s;ecrated to the maintenance of the altars and mini&s;ters of our Saviour and our God, and the charitable relief of the poor of the land, to whom there the law gives no &s;upport; all the&s;e rapine has &s;eized upon as her own. The multitude, made blindly furious, are now de&s;troying with their own hands the means of their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; the part of the wealth of the trafficker, the merchant, and the landholder, which &s;ets to work the indu&s;try of the needy; from whence alone the hire of the labourer and artificer can be paid; which cannot be a little dimini&s;hed, without extreme di&s;tre&s;s to all tho&s;e to whom it yielded the bread of life, and taking it ab&s;olutely away from many: even this &s;torehou&s;e and trea&s;ury of the poor has been broken open, and plundered of much of what it contained. The cries of violence and murder are in the whole land; their choice buildings, and their cities, they have laid wa&s;te with fire, and their names are &s;poken of no more: their towns are polluted with blood, and the inhabitants are wa&s;ted in the mid&s;t thereof; and death walks at large in their &s;treets and highways&mdash;Their two &s;overeigns have peri&s;hed by murder, tricked out by the cruel in&s;olence of mockery in the robes of ju&s;tice: their king, ble&s;&s;ed in that mild quality of nature, that affection to his people, which loyalty and humanity mu&s;t love; who, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that au&s;terity of firmne&s;s, who&s;e awful terrors have been known to wither the arm of guilt rai&s;ed to &s;trike, would po&s;&s;ibly have repelled the mo&s;t torturing arrow which can pierce the &s;oul, and de&s;pair, from his own innocent bo&s;om. Their princes have been driven into indigence and exile; their nobles, and their honourable and wi&s;e men, are either wandering in &s;trange lands, condemned to drain to the very dregs the bitterne&s;s of mi&s;ery, which is mingled in their cup to drink; or eat the &s;canty bread of poverty, &s;teeped in the tears of angui&s;h that knows no hope; or fa&s;t bound in mi&s;ery and iron, buried in dungeons, vi&s;ited of no day &s;prung from on high, never to breathe this purer air, or &s;ee the light of the &s;un again, until the voice of the murderer &s;hall be heard, calling each of them forth to take his &s;ad turn in death. Others hunted for &s;laughter in the city, hunted for &s;laughter in the field; friend dreading in his friend a betrayer, and a murderer in him whom he knoweth not. The dying blood of many hath &s;tained their own walls, now become the pro|perty of the robber, and calleth for vengeance in vain. Some have peri&s;hed in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e whom their bounty had &s;u&s;tained with food and raiment, and by their execrable hands. And many rendered furious to di&s;traction by the terror that pur&s;ued them by day, and the fear of the arrow that flicth in darkne&s;s, have e&s;caped from evils, almo&s;t too overwhelming for man to bear, by the &s;word of &s;elf-de&s;truction. In the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e, the mini&s;ters of his law have been &s;lain heaps upon heaps; and the altars of the God of all mercies have been defiled with their blood. In the language of the &s;criptures, their prie&s;ts are cut off by the &s;word, and there are no widows to make lamentation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">If it be a&s;ked, what has di&s;natured man into &s;uch &s;avagene&s;s? it may be an|&s;wered, that one leading cau&s;e is, the prevalence of the la&s;t wickedne&s;s of &s;elf-delu&s;ion&mdash;that furious delirium of the impiety of minds to all good works and thoughts reprobate&mdash;Athei&s;m; her numerous profe&s;&s;ors, to free untutored guilt from every re&s;traint, to pluck con&s;cience, the vicegerent of the Divinity in our bo&s;oms, from her throne, have compelled the voice of the law to proclaim to the unknowing multitude, that the &s;ufferings of the &s;ublime&s;t virtue and piety will meet no retribution after this life; the darke&s;t crimes which can outrage human nature, no puni&s;hment; that death is an eternal and undi&s;turbed &s;leep alike to both; and that heaven and hell are vi&s;ionary fables. <Q>They have &s;aid aloud, there is no God: they have done abominable works; and eat up the people as they eat bread:</Q><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xiv. Ver. 1, 4.</NOTE> De&s;truction and unhappine&s;s are in their ways.</P>
<P>The extremes of virtue and of vice have this in common; that their votaries labour, with unremitting a&s;&s;iduity, to make all men like them&s;elves. Chri&s;ti|anity had her apo&s;tles and teachers, who di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into every country, to in&s;truct mankind in the go&s;pel of peace, as the means of univer&s;al happine&s;s&mdash; &s;alvation: the mi&s;&s;ionaries of this my&s;tery of iniquity have penetrated into every kingdom of the Chri&s;tian world, to make converts to a &s;y&s;tem pregnant with univer&s;al mi&s;ery; nor have they laboured here ab&s;olutely without &s;ucce&s;s, though with much le&s;s than in their folly they had flattered them&s;elves to obtain. Our national name has not e&s;caped being di&s;graced, by their finding &s;ome open and avowed patrons, others more &s;ubtle and indirect, and therefore more dan|gerous abettors of their atrocious delu&s;ions. We are met here to &s;upplicate the throne of grace, to prevent the &s;preading of this poi&s;on among us; and pre&s;erve us from its dreadful con&s;equences: and to intreat him who &s;itteth thereon for ever, that he would ble&s;s our exertions in this new and more than ordinary &s;tate of peril; and be him&s;elf the &s;afe-guard and defence of his &s;ervants: who have been compelled, by the &s;tern nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to fight the battles of reli|gion, ju&s;tice, and human kind: not vi&s;iting us according to our iniquities, and the abu&s;e of his mercies toward us, which in the &s;olemn devotions of this day we have confe&s;&s;ed unto him; but that he will grant us the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit, that we may by the &s;incerity of our repentance, and by actual amendment of life, render our&s;elves worthy of the continuance and increa&s;e of the benefits he has vouch&s;afed unto us.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of the national act of humiliation of this day, differs from all tho&s;e which have preceded it in our former wars, chiefly on the fir&s;t of the&s;e accounts, the danger of &s;preading a &s;y&s;tem of crimes, and a &s;y&s;tem of criminal &s;ophi&s;try among us, and that under the fallacious name of new di&s;coveries in political morality. It was again&s;t the &s;ame fanatical perver&s;ion of the principles of freedom, leading the way to the &s;ame atrocities, that the words of our Saviour in the text were directed; and though they did not &s;erve as a caution to the men of that generation, they ought to be received as &s;uch by all nations, and in all ages, that hold the truth in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">Our Saviour, when he wept over the future calamities of Jeru&s;alem, begins with lamenting, that the things which belonged to her peace were hidden from her eyes; that is, that the Jews were ignorant of the cau&s;e of tho&s;e terrible cala|mities which were coming upon them; and therefore were not able, by guarding again&s;t them, or removing them in time, to prevent their natural effect: the things which belonged to their peace were hidden from them.</P>
<P>The prophecy it&s;elf met with &s;o remarkable a completion, that it has been con&s;tantly and invincibly applied, as one of the leading proofs of the truth of our Lord's mi&s;&s;ion: and in the train of this demon&s;tration, every article of it has been critically and accurately compared with the hi&s;tory of the de&s;truction of the city, and the final di&s;per&s;ion of the Jewi&s;h people. This account was written by Jo&s;ephus, who at the beginning of the calamitous war he de&s;cribes, had taken arms on the popular &s;ide, and was their able&s;t leader.</P>
<P>As it has been the bu&s;ine&s;s of the defenders of Chri&s;tianity above mentioned, to parallel the events recorded by him with the prophecy; &s;o the pre&s;ent &s;ubject leads me to &s;elect, out of the &s;ame hi&s;tory, tho&s;e cau&s;es which, co-operating with the providence of God, produced the cata&s;trophe he relates, and which drew tears from the Redeemer of mankind, when he &s;aw that they were &s;o hidden from the eyes of the Jewi&s;h nation, that they would not remove them in their day, and when their exi&s;tence as a people continued. This I &s;hall do in a &s;eries of extracts from the hi&s;tory, and as frequently in the words of Jo&s;ephus, as the nature and limits of a &s;ermon will admit; giving to the&s;e detached pa&s;&s;ages, the arrange|ment nece&s;&s;ary to their forming a connected repre&s;entation, intermixing them with &s;ome explanatory ob&s;ervations, together with &s;uch of the hi&s;torical facts, as may &s;hew the force of the&s;e cau&s;es in operation, as well as their tendency.</P>
<P>A new &s;et of principles, embraced by a great part of the nation, was the leading and proximate cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;ignal calamities of the Jews, a &s;ect had recently ari&s;en in Galilee, of which one of the name of Judas was the founder; their tenets were di&s;tingui&s;hed by that fanatici&s;m of liberty, which always ulti|mately proves its de&s;truction, where it breaks out; they held that as &s;ervants of God, they &s;hould not acknowledge any mortal man, as prince or lord over them;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;ephus Hud&s;oni 1720, 1060 &agr;; from which edition all the extracts are taken.</NOTE> e&s;teeming it a degeneracy in every one, who had arms to defend his freedom, to &s;ubmit even to the mild exerci&s;e of &s;overeign power.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Page 1094, line 16, the &s;ections are quoted by Greek numerals, the line of a page by common figures.</NOTE> It was in the name of liberty that we have taken up arms, exclaimed that ardent parti&s;an of a republic, the high prie&s;t Ananus, after Jeru&s;alem was filled with anarchy and murder.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>P. 1173:10</P>
<P>In the peru&s;al of &s;uch parts of the hi&s;tory as I examined for this purpo&s;e, I was impre&s;&s;ed, not only with the &s;imilitude of the cau&s;es which produced the calamities of the French and Jewi&s;h nations, but al&s;o with a double paralleli&s;m between the crimes of both, and the events which followed them, as far as the con&s;equences of the commotions in France have yet proceeded. Accounts of this kind ought to be drawn up &s;o, as to leave the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the hearers, which the &s;peaker has received: in what follows, this is attended to; though I have not thought proper to point out any particular in&s;tances of the&s;e &s;ingular paralleli&s;ms.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">Eloquence and philo&s;ophy, which have been frequently perverted to introduce confu&s;ion into &s;ociety, had been thus abu&s;ed in Judea. Matthias and Judas, two public teachers of the greate&s;t celebrity, &s;upported extravagant and fanatic interpretations of the ancient laws, to rai&s;e actual commotion and in&s;urrection; they were attended by &s;uch numbers of the youth of the higher rank, that Jo&s;e|phus calls the multitude of their followers an army; to incite their enthu&s;ia&s;m to the highe&s;t pitch, they &s;eem to have a&s;&s;umed the character of in&s;pired teachers, as well as political orators, promi&s;ing to tho&s;e who died for their exaggerated tenets, to which they gave the &s;educing name of the laws of their forefathers, the immediate attainment of immortality of happine&s;s; and denouncing &s;ome|thing like an anathema again&s;t tho&s;e who were lukewarm.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1040 &bgr;.</NOTE> When fanatici&s;m came afterwards to pollute the &s;pirit of liberty, the doctrine of the&s;e &s;ophi&s;ts coale&s;ced with it, and gave it malignity and exten&s;ion.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1324:4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>
<P>This &s;pirit of delu&s;ion was &s;pread, with great diligence, among the populace of Judea; and every pretext was &s;eized with avidity, for theatrical declamations, loaded with the mo&s;t exaggerated encomiums of liberty.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">1085:6</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor does any a&s;&s;iduity &s;eem to have been wanted to inculcate the &s;ame po|pular errors, in the countries which bordered upon Judea. The Jewi&s;h religion had extended it&s;elf much in the neighbouring imperial provinces, particularly Syria: and this unhappy political enthu&s;ia&s;m appears to have &s;truck a deep root in the minds of the pro&s;elytes. A &s;anguinary incur&s;ion of the Jews into that province was repul&s;ed; but the &s;trength of the Syrians of their party, in every city, was &s;uch, that after their retreat, the natives were divided into two ho&s;tile armies; and the &s;afety of one party was &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in anticipating the plots of the other by their de&s;truction: their days were &s;pent in mutual &s;laughter, and uncertainty and terror made their nights more in&s;upportable.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1095, &bgr;</NOTE></P>
<P>This deluding and unhappy fa&s;cination of the minds of the people had its effects increa&s;ed by other cau&s;es: the manners and morals of the great majority of the Jewi&s;h nation were extremely corrupted; this was clearly &s;hewn, by the prevalence of the crime of robbery among the lower cla&s;s; an infallible criterion of &s;uch corruption. In &s;everal parts of the country, large gangs of robbers roamed up and down, and committed their depredations in open day; and many joined the political party for innovation, &s;timulated by the de&s;ire of increa&s;ing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and plundering the weak in public commotions.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1084:45</NOTE></P>
<P>Sedition had been infu&s;ed into and corrupted the &s;oldiery; for the flagitious Eleazar, general of the Temple-guard, and who at the beginning appears to have commanded the army, was able to &s;ecure that important fortre&s;s for the in&s;urgents.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1090, &bgr; and 1105:45</NOTE> Manahem, celebrated for his ardent and nervous eloquence, and ambitious perhaps of becoming in effect a &s;overeign, having gathered a party together, &s;urpri&s;ed the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;ada, in the ca&s;tle of which was contained the ar&s;enal of King Herod, took out the arms, and di&s;tributed them to &s;he robbers and low people: the in&s;urgents of the capital put him at their head.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1093, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> I may add here, that he fell the fir&s;t victim of the jealou&s;y of their other leaders.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">109<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">:35</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">At the beginning of the&s;e commotions, many of the nobles and great men countenanced them, who had either imbibed the new principles, or who were influenced by fear, or factious ambition; or who acted with the in&s;urgents, in hopes by their per&s;onal authority to impre&s;s a direction on their movements le&s;s fatal to their country than they would otherwi&s;e take; but they &s;oon found the nominal powers committed to them, without effect to re&s;train the madne&s;s of the people: and it was not by military obedience alone (which was in a manner annihilated) that their leaders of the fir&s;t rank and ability were able to re&s;train their mutinous &s;oldiers from the pillage and de&s;truction of great cities.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">941:2:30</NOTE> Tho&s;e who guided the mea&s;ures of the nobles, were ju&s;tly jealous of the de&s;igns of Eleazar, whom I have before mentioned; and had taken care, after the cala|mitous retreat of Ce&s;tius, to have him excluded from the greater offices. With the &s;poils he had then gained, and part of the public trea&s;ure, which he con|verted to his own purpo&s;es, he bribed the populace, and got all the effective power into his own hand; and this without the &s;hadow of any regular ap|pointment.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">1105:45</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus undermined, the &s;hort-lived empty &s;emblance of authority, with which the nobles and great men of the land had the appearance of being inve&s;ted, &s;oon entirely vani&s;hed: the melancholy remainder of their fate will be pre&s;ently related. The events of popular commotions mo&s;tly depend upon agents of a different rank; and while the former retain the appearance of guiding them, the reality is &s;oon transferred to the latter. Thus at an early period of the war, we find that among tho&s;e who at fir&s;t &s;hared the &s;uperiority wre&s;ted from them were Je&s;us, the &s;on of Sophias, the chief of the faction of common &s;ailors and beggars, who plundered and &s;et fire to the palace at Tiberias;<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">910:44</NOTE> and Jo&s;eph, the natural &s;on of a woman who &s;old medicines, at the head of a re&s;olute party, took up arms at Gamala again&s;t King Agrippa, and declared for liberty; compelling &s;ome by force to join his party, and murdering others whom he could not overawe.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">922:13</NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="8">A very great part of the&s;e in&s;urgents were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Sica|rians; this is derived from the latin word <HI>Sica,</HI> a dagger: they went privately armed with a curved dagger under their robes, with which they perpetrated innumerable murders, frequently aggravated with the mo&s;t inhuman &s;pecies of treachery.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">895:23.1324:43 et alibi.</NOTE></P>

<P>My object has been to &s;how, that fatal perver&s;ion of principle, that turpitude of manners, that licentiou&s;ne&s;s and depravity of the multitude, and that &s;eries of crimes which brought this de&s;truction upon Jeru&s;alem, and again&s;t which our Saviour, in this celebrated prophecy, &s;o pathetically warns that city. I &s;hall now briefly run over the mo&s;t remarkable events which took place in this war, as well tho&s;e which retarding the cata&s;trophe, made it more fatal, as tho&s;e which directly co operated with the cau&s;es above &s;tated.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the war, the Roman Emperor &s;ent his general Ce&s;tius with a mighty army to attack the city, which &s;heltered the&s;e parricides of their country; his progre&s;s was, upon the whole, &s;uch that, at fir&s;t, he &s;eemed upon the very point of fini&s;hing the war, when he was driven back with great &s;laugh|ter of his hor&s;emen and footmen, the lo&s;s of his trea&s;ure, and of his engines of war, his whole army having narrowly e&s;caped de&s;truction. This opened the rich im|perial province of Syria to the inva&s;ion of the Jews, incen&s;ed by a great &s;laughter of their countrymen at Cae&s;area, in which they de&s;troyed many towns and cities, and carried death and deva&s;tation every where; they likewi&s;e extended their incur&s;ions into the territories of Tyre; &s;mall in extent, but celebrated in &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, as the mo&s;t commercial &s;tate in the ancient world; &s;ome of the cities thereof they took and plundered. The torrent of this inva&s;ion was put a &s;top to, and they met a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement for the ravages they had committed; but quiet did not return to the&s;e afflicted provinces by the repul&s;e of the Jews: &s;he di&s;&s;en&s;ions between their parti&s;ans in tho&s;e countries, and the other inhabitants, yet continued to make them a &s;cene of inte&s;tine violence and

blood&s;hed. At length the armies of the empire under Ve&s;pa&s;ian returned to|wards Judea to put an end to this bloody anarchy: the kings of the &s;urround|ing countries joined their armies to his: the&s;e were Agrippa, king of Chalcis; Sohemus, king of Eme&s;&s;a; Antiochus, king of Commagene; and Malchus, of Arabia. By the conclu&s;ion of the third year of the war, all the cities and &s;trong|holds of the Jews, which hindered the be&s;ieging of Jeru&s;alem, were taken; and in the following, that city, wa&s;ted by the mo&s;t de&s;tructive famine upon record, attacked by a powerful enemy without, tho&s;e within &s;laughtering each other with more than ho&s;tile malignity, was laid totally de&s;olate, according to the prophecy of our Saviour:&mdash;the dreadful puni&s;hment of perverted principles of liberty inflamed into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, licentiou&s;ne&s;s into anarchy, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crimes to which they opened the way, and which, in atrocity, had never then been equalled.</P>
<P>I am not &s;peaking again&s;t a &s;ober and regulated &s;pirit of freedom: that man is equally the enemy to &s;ociety, who would wither it into nervele&s;s frigidity, or inflame it into the fury of fanatici&s;m; the latter and the former are alike fatal to its exi&s;tence; and its &s;ober defenders mu&s;t, at every period, be mo&s;t vigilant to guard it on that &s;ide on which the attack is made. With re&s;pect to human life, an emaciated decline is not a &s;urer forerunner of its extinction, than the bloated corpulence of the drop&s;y: whatever exceeds the limits of its natural &s;tandard in its growth, has its exi&s;tence &s;oon terminated; and when the energy of this principle has pa&s;&s;ed over the bounds of good order, its force has been &s;pent upon it&s;elf and to its own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not enter much upon this &s;ubject in the ab&s;tract; &s;omething I &s;hall, however, &s;ay on the effects of a popular enthu&s;ia&s;m of the principles of liberty; &s;omething of a new crime of duplicity, a new profligate &s;pecies of &s;ophi&s;try, which is currently u&s;ed to rou&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace to that delirium.</P>
<P>When the multitude has recently &s;eized the actual exerci&s;e of dominion, they will be jealous of the abu&s;e of power wherever lodged, and e&s;pecially where it has been formerly lodged; and this jealou&s;y will not confine it&s;elf to the per&s;ons of their former governors, but will extend to the whole cla&s;s of men from which they were ordinarily taken; they will &s;uppo&s;e in them a kind of joint intere&s;t with the former, and that the expectations they had been brought up in, will attach them, not only to the plenitude, but al&s;o to the old abu&s;es of the old power, which they had always looked forward to as what might one day become their own; and this &s;u&s;picion will per&s;uade them ultimately, that authority depo&s;ited in the hands of individuals of either of the&s;e two &s;ets of men, is the fir&s;t &s;tep back to the &s;uppo&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ive domination they have newly ca&s;t off.</P>
<P>They will, therefore, go con&s;iderably lower to place their confidence; it will be given to per&s;ons of a very different de&s;cription; and their confidence is power and office. But though a new &s;et of men may obtain the names of offices, their former &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion, contra&s;ted with their pre&s;ent elevation; their want of per&s;onal weight, compared with the dignity of their predece&s;&s;ors; their recent equality with tho&s;e whom they are now to re&s;train and govern, will greatly dimini&s;h their effective power, even in the ordinary cour&s;e of affairs;
<PB N="11" REF="12">
and they mu&s;t become totally inefficient at &s;uch a cri&s;is, when licentiou&s;ne&s;s trampling upon order, has but ju&s;t ca&s;t off the re&s;traints of a more vigorous, awful, and e&s;tabli&s;hed authority.</P>
<P>The actual power of government in the hands of &s;uch rulers, and their power of per&s;uading the multitude, or that part of the multitude which controuls the re&s;t, and has given them their &s;hadow of eminence, are the &s;ame thing; it is by per&s;ua&s;ion, by influence, or by force only, that mankind can be governed. Now the multitude, under &s;uch rulers, is to be &s;wayed by its pa&s;&s;ions alone, for when they have enjoyed the guidance of things for a &s;hort time, they will not at once lay it down, and in&s;tantly be re-converted into an inert ma&s;s; and going on, therefore, to act, and in &s;ituations &s;o new to them, if they be ever &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, they mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, act before their under&s;tandings can be informed, and pa&s;&s;ions or maxims analogous to their dictates will be the only motives which can work upon them; nor will they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led a&s;ide from, or otherwi&s;e fru&s;trated of, the ends thus taken up by them; hence, likewi&s;e, power will be conferred on tho&s;e only whom they think mo&s;t likely to u&s;e it for the &s;ame ends; that is, on tho&s;e who enter into the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and views with the &s;ame fervor, or tho&s;e more dangerous and atrocious agents who copy out or &s;urpa&s;s their appearance and effects in cold blood. Such will be the character of their new rulers; and the only u&s;e they can derive from their powers, while they hold them, will be to give to the movements of the multitude, varied ince&s;&s;antly and rapidly in every direction which the chance, or the folly, or the pa&s;&s;ion of the hour can impre&s;s upon them, &s;omething like a unity of impul&s;e. Now, the pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude, which &s;uch com|motions call into exerci&s;e with terrible and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s effect, are envy, depre|dation, and revenge; and the o&s;ten&s;ible ruler mu&s;t go &s;omething further with them than being blind to the&s;e enormities; he mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;ervient to them;&mdash; fatal are the ends he is rai&s;ed to a mock elevation to promote; relentle&s;s and atrocious the pa&s;&s;ions he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s or &s;imulate to rule.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a people &s;hould endeavour to put a &s;top even to the greater part of that progre&s;&s;ion of evils to which the tumultuous di&s;&s;olution of an e&s;tabli&s;hed government leads, or pau&s;e immediately after its fir&s;t ferment, that is, when its jealou&s;y, extended to the per&s;ons of all their former governors, and the whole cla&s;s of men who had ordinarily ri&s;en to that eminence, has excluded them from offices, it will have already lo&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;afety, without a quick retreat; for thus, not only the ability of all tho&s;e whom practical experience had formed to the difficult art of governing mankind, mu&s;t be flung away, but al&s;o that order of men whom the united di&s;cipline of frequent reflections upon it, of the frequent conver&s;ation of men practi&s;ed in it, and an unremitted &s;uper|vi&s;ion of their mea&s;ures, had rai&s;ed to the next degree of aptitude for this great tru&s;t, will be pa&s;&s;ed by, to introduce a &s;et of new men, totally uninformed in, and, by con&s;equence, totally unequal to the ta&s;k; for the uninformed natural faculties, the mo&s;t adapted to any object, require much di&s;cipline and previous exerci&s;e, before they can be brought into actual u&s;e with full advantage: and the cunning of the workman availeth him alone in the art he has been trained to by daily u&s;e.

<P>After this con&s;ideration of the con&s;equences of the fanatici&s;m of liberty, I &s;hall employ a little time, to con&s;ider a new mean which has been employed to excite it, which, in proportion to its &s;ucce&s;s, mu&s;t make its deva&s;tations &s;urpa&s;s in magnitude and terror, whatever the tragical page of hi&s;tory has ever a&s;cribed to them; I mean the doctrine of the equality of the rights of man. The phra&s;e, 'Equality of Rights,' has two &s;en&s;es; each of which I &s;hall lay down. Our rights are of three kinds: tho&s;e of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, of liberty, and of property, It is the la&s;t cla&s;s which is to be con&s;idered; rights of property may be &s;aid to be equal in two &s;en&s;es; in degree or in extent; the&s;e rights may differ in degree, as that of the ab&s;olute proprietor of a thing, and the u&s;ufructuary; and without doubt, the right of all the individuals in &s;ociety, in what they hold under one and the &s;ame title or intere&s;t, is equal in degree; and in this country, the free|hold

of the poor man in his little cottage, is in law, and in actual enjoyment, as &s;ecure as that of his rich neighbour in his exten&s;ive and magnificent deme&s;ne: and the greate&s;t peer in the land mu&s;t perform &s;uit and &s;ervice in the courts of the laborious yeoman; who&s;e indu&s;try has purcha&s;ed, or who&s;e ance&s;tors have bequeathed him a little manor: and in this &s;en&s;e of the term Equality every man is equal in his rights, and in the actual enjoyment of them: but the more ordinary way of con&s;idering rights is in their extent, or the number and value of the &s;ubjects to which the rights of the individual extend; and in this acceptation, if two men be equal in rights, the value of their property will be equal; and to make all men equal in rights, the ma&s;s of general property mu&s;t be equali&s;ed; and this is the only &s;en&s;e, in which the right of things are ever conceived to differ, or to be equal, by the generality of the lower cla&s;s of mankind: it &s;eldom being of u&s;e to them to compare rights in other points of view; very few of them have extended their thoughts to this compari&s;on: with the multitude, the equa|lity of the right of property, and a right to equality of property, are ab&s;olutely convertible terms.</P>
<P>Many have a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly preached up this equality, knowing that what they taught, was received in the latter &s;en&s;e by the common people; and intending it &s;o to be: and when they are pre&s;&s;ed with the con&s;equences of a doctrine, which gives licen&s;e to general deva&s;tation; and, by ultimately arming every man again&s;t his neighbour, not only di&s;&s;olves &s;ociety into a number of di&s;connected indivi|duals, but e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;tate of war, of all again&s;t all; they defend them&s;elves by proving the propo&s;ition in the former &s;en&s;e, that every right is equal, con&s;i|dered as to its degree: now as the criminality or innocence of every principle is to be judged, not from the narrowe&s;t limits of the &s;en&s;e of its terms, but from the meaning in which it is known it will be received by the hearer, which is to be taken as that intended to be conveyed, or its cogni&s;able &s;en&s;e, no delu&s;ion has been more criminal, than the terrible fallacy, intentionally conveyed in the am|biguous maxim of the&s;e &s;ophi&s;ts; to all of them indeed this duplicity is not to be imputed; &s;ome have covered this doctrine with a &s;light veil only, made as tran&s;|parent as their utmo&s;t dexterity could weave it; and have not he&s;itated even to draw that a&s;ide to cen&s;ure the caution of tho&s;e who held the &s;ame opinion, for &s;ome &s;u&s;picion they have expre&s;&s;ed, that it may be dangerous to reveal it although true.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on which, at this juncture, may have induced &s;ome men, not of de&s;perate fortunes, to connive at, or &s;ecretly favour the currency of this principle, to excite the minds of the common people again&s;t government, may very pro|bably have been, their falling in with the &s;entiments of a writer, who certainly had his &s;hare in the origin, and in a great part of the progre&s;s of the fermentation now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, that the nation having been frequently duped by profe&s;&s;ions of patrioti&s;m, dictated by &s;elf-intere&s;t, and terminating in impo&s;ture, has been led into a conviction, that all are alike fal&s;e; and the zeal they were once capable of exciting, has &s;unk into inactivity and de&s;pondence. Thus convinced that the ancient topics, by which the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace had been &s;o often rou&s;ed, had lo&s;t almo&s;t all their effects, by the frequency of their repetition; they have judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to permit &s;omething of favour and &s;pirit to be given to their vapidne&s;s, by adding the &s;timulus of this new doctrine to them; and
<PB N="14" REF="15">
re-kindling the dying languor of public principle, in the populace, by the invigo|rating pro&s;pect of general plunder.</P>
<P>It is not to be under&s;tood, that tho&s;e who thus in &s;ecret are not adver&s;e to the&s;e notions obtaining &s;ome exten&s;ion, who countenance the men who propagate them, &s;o far as to act with them for certain purpo&s;es; and endeavour to draw a veil over their progre&s;s and practices; are capable of taking an active part in diffu&s;ing &s;uch principles of atrocity; or of wi&s;hing their ultimate e&s;tabli&s;hment. What they expect from their fir&s;t effects, they look forward to with plea&s;ure; thinking to convert them to their own ends; and the &s;econd, and all that are to follow, they confide they &s;hall be able, with the greate&s;t facility, to re&s;train; it is not nece&s;&s;ary to employ any arguments to &s;hew the guilt of &s;uch experiments upon the well-being of &s;ociety; and even upon its being as &s;uch. It is to their prudence only an addre&s;s is to be made: and their claim to this quality, e&s;timated from their pre&s;ent conduct, &s;eems much to re&s;emble that of the inha|bitants of &s;ome valley, lying between two ranges of hills, which &s;uffers tempo|rarily from drought; but would become highly productive, if a &s;tream could be led through it to water it; and to effect this, a great lake, which is con&s;tantly eating away its banks, being &s;ituated on the very verge of the heights which almo&s;t overhang them, they are determined to cut a &s;ufficient opening through the &s;light impediment to the &s;upply of their wants; or per&s;uaded to let it be done for them: but, blind leaders of the blind! ye &s;hall too late lament, that the cataract from on high cannot be turned a&s;ide; and when the floods of the mighty waters are let loo&s;e, ye &s;hall not call to them with the voice of your power, and &s;ay, hitherto &s;hall ye come and no further.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments I have ventured to bring from the code of political morality; I know our preachers have for a long time, either totally ab&s;tained from the u&s;e of &s;uch topics; or when the &s;ubject has forced them forward, they have been faintly introduced, and illu&s;trated with that he&s;itating reluctance, which is always manife&s;t in a di&s;cour&s;e, the matter of which powerfully draws one way, while con&s;iderations which are foreign to it, induce the preacher to deflect it from its natural and be&s;t direction; to give force and even place to arguments of this kind, in &s;ermons, has been almo&s;t univer&s;ally reprobated. And this act of pro&s;cription, has been &s;upported by many &s;trong in&s;tances of their abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet this is to be taken as the evidence of one &s;ide only; and is of the nature, of what the advocate for one party in a cau&s;e, is held to produce; but he who would decide the point as a legitimate judge, and is de&s;irous to impre&s;s us with a conviction of the validity of his &s;entence, would be obliged to weigh the u&s;es, which have been derived from the &s;ober application of &s;uch principles, in the addre&s;&s;es of the clergy to the people, again&s;t the abu&s;es, which may be &s;o proved: and he would find that the tenor of our own hi&s;tory, at lea&s;t, de|po&s;es again&s;t this prohibition. Be&s;ide, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, the argument on which it is founded, is one of tho&s;e forms, which are illegitimate, and therefore it is not conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But as many authorities may be alledged, making again&s;t what I have &s;aid, I &s;hall therefore &s;hew this error ab&s;olutely, that is, from the nature of moral prin|ciples; and that of the duty of a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel: and in order to this,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
fir&s;t, let the nature of that love which connects every man to his kind, be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Tracing this affection from that center where it commences, to the extreme circuit to which it dilates it&s;elf, to embrace all human kind, we &s;hall find it, as it expands, under different modifications, a&s;&s;uming the form of the fine&s;t and noble&s;t affections which dignify our nature. Let us begin with the narrow circle of dome&s;tic life; there we owe to it much of the tendere&s;t charities of human nature; tho&s;e of father, brother, hu&s;band: its next operations are more widely diffu&s;ed; and it here becomes that generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, which binds kindred minds and kindred virtues together; and further dilated, it unites the&s;e in&s;ulated groups in the u&s;eful and agreeable amity of neighbour|hood and in the exchange of tho&s;e &s;maller mutual good offices and attentions, on which &s;o many of the enjoyments of life depend: expanding in a yet wider circle over to the whole political community in which we live; it becomes the parent of more augu&s;t virtues, and wears the &s;acred and reverend name of pa|trioti&s;m: and &s;till continuing its progre&s;s, until it dilates it&s;elf over all the tribes of mankind, it terminates only in univer&s;al benevolence.</P>
<P>Now it is the duty of the preacher to excite his congregation to the virtuous charities of affinity, of friend&s;hip, of neighbourhood; to enter fully upon every topic to enforce them; to point out the means to obtain their be&s;t effects; to examine with accuracy into the whole nature of tho&s;e fal&s;e judgements and vices, which ob&s;truct the good ends they tend to procure: employing every aid he can derive, from the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom which time has con&s;igned to him in tru&s;t for the benefit of mankind, joined to the be&s;t exertions of his own rea&s;on, to refute the one and to cha&s;ti&s;e and re&s;train the other. And does not the law of continuance indicate our duty to be the &s;ame, with re&s;pect to the &s;ame affection in its two further modifications; the love of the political &s;ociety to which we belong, and of human kind in general? this mu&s;t be granted to be true of the latter; with what &s;hadow of pretention then can it be denied of the former?</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the rules of human conduct laid down in the divine law, and the duties on which its mini&s;ters are to in&s;truct the people, are co-exten&s;ive: nor do we find in that law, a di&s;pen&s;ation from inculcating any one, or doing it with he&s;itation and incompletely; now every duty has a &s;et of principles on which it depends, a mode in which it is be&s;t illu&s;trated; and if we do not urge the&s;e principles with our utmo&s;t force, and in that mode, we de&s;ert our own. Now the divine law in&s;tructs us in every duty, both by po&s;itive pre|cepts, and by the examples of actions recorded in it with approbation or cen|&s;ure: and from the&s;e two &s;ources conjointly, we may deduce from the holy Scriptures, the greater outlines of every branch of political morality; that is, of our duty to tho&s;e rulers God has &s;et over us; and to the &s;ociety in which we live, con&s;idered as a nation.</P>
<P>I will therefore here point out the confirmation of what is above laid down, again&s;t that criminal perver&s;ion of the &s;pirit of liberty, which unbraces and dis|joints effective government, receives from the written word of God.</P>
<P>But this I mu&s;t preface with the following ob&s;ervation; that no man who admits the Scripture as God's law, can doubt of his ab&s;olute obligation to
<PB N="16" REF="17">
every thing contained therein. He who is a Chri&s;tian, mu&s;t &s;o far equally be|lieve that his &s;alvation depends upon his obedience to the whole of what is written in the law of Chri&s;t; that he cannot be &s;aved thereby, if he &s;elect &s;uch parts as he chu&s;es to obey, and rejects &s;uch others as he does not. The &s;y&s;tem of the laws given us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, follow the nature of all others in this re&s;pect: he who is &s;ubject to them, cannot at his choice obey &s;ome and di&s;|obey others; for &s;uch ability includes the power of di&s;pen&s;ing with or repealing them; which power mu&s;t be as great as that which enacted them.</P>
<P>But I hope that we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t, that we have only to have his commandments recited to us, to believe them to be our duty; and that we have the hone&s;ty of nature, when we know our duty to endeavour to the ut|mo&s;t to fulfil it; and not &s;uffer the depravity of our wills to pre&s;s &s;elf-delu&s;ion with its entanglements and &s;ubtilties into their &s;ervice, &s;o to hoodwink our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive rea&s;on, that "&s;eeing we &s;ee not, and hearing we do not under&s;tand."</P>
<P>Some of the commands of the divine law, on the duty of a peaceable obe|dience to legal government, I &s;hall now lay down. The nature of our oath of allegiance, and the obligation it draws after it, is declared in the following terms: <Q>Keep the king's commandments, and that in regard to the oath of God.</Q><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. chap. viii. ver. 2.</NOTE> Our Saviour has commanded us to contribute of our &s;ub&s;tance to the &s;upport of our &s;overeigns, in the exerci&s;e of their dignified offices, in the following words: <Q>Render unto Cae&s;ar, the things which are Cae&s;ar's; and unto God, the things which are God's.</Q><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mark xii. 17.

In regard to the reverence in which a &s;overeign is to be had, we are commanded to fear the Lord and the king:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xxiv. 21.</NOTE> and again, to fear God and honour the king.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 17.</NOTE> The&s;e commandments conjoining piety to God, and duty to our prince, clearly &s;et that duty next in rank and con&s;equence to that of our Creator, however great the interval; that is, it con&s;titutes the fir&s;t of duties to our fellow creatures.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It follows from this mode of illu&s;trating our duty to our king, that we ought to expre&s;s our&s;elves to him, and of him and of his e&s;tate, in a manner the mo&s;t decorous: and where a language has two &s;ets of terms, or forms of &s;peaking, to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing, with re&s;pect to different objects; one applied to tho&s;e of great dignity, the other to tho&s;e which are mean and contemptible; the ap|plication of the latter to kings, expre&s;sly contravenes the&s;e commandments to honour them: it is an endeavour to diffu&s;e contemptuous impre&s;&s;ions of their office: a breach of this rule is of the nature of the offence of tho&s;e, who are not afraid to "&s;peak evil of dignities:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet ii. 10.</NOTE> who &s;et little by that command, "Cur&s;e not the king, no not in thy thought,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. x. 20</NOTE> who de&s;pi&s;e government and do|minion, pre&s;umptuous are they and &s;elf-willed.</NOTE> Tho&s;e who commence a re&s;i&s;tance to power, legally exerci&s;ed, mu&s;t have it in contemplation either to be puni&s;hed with great &s;everity, or finally to overthrow it; for its con&s;equences &s;eldom can be expected to &s;top &s;hort of one of the&s;e two extremes.

Such re&s;i&s;tance is therefore a crime, the fatal con&s;e|quences of which are equalled by no other; and again&s;t it the Almighty God him&s;elf has i&s;&s;ued this command, and annexed this penalty to the breach of it; "re&s;i&s;t not the power, for he that re&s;i&s;teth &s;hall receive to him&s;elf damnation."<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Rom. xiii. 2.</P>
<P>In the Scripture the relation God &s;tands in to us is very frequently illu&s;trated by metaphors taken from tho&s;e of paternity and &s;overeignty; he is called our Father and our King. One ob&s;er|vation is to be made upon the &s;econd of the&s;e metaphors; if the monarchical form of government be in its nature bad, or, which is the &s;ame thing, if the happine&s;s of mankind be le&s;s, and their unhappine&s;s greater under it, than under &s;ome other po&s;&s;ible form or forms, it mu&s;t be in con&s;e|quence of its nature, that is, from a divine con&s;titution; from which the nature of every thing, or combination of things, is equally derived; therefore tho&s;e who admit the Scripture to be the word of God, and hold this opinion of monarchy, make the Divine Being very frequently illu&s;trate the nature of his own dominion, <HI>(ab&s;it verbo bla&s;phemia)</HI> by repre&s;enting it as analogous to a human form of government, which is by his own con&s;titution le&s;s perfect than &s;ome others, and productive of unnece&s;&s;ary evils.</P>
<P>With &s;ome it will give weight to the&s;e moral maxims, inculcating obedience to princes, to find their duties to their &s;ubjects laid down with at lea&s;t equal force and frequency in Scripture. There are few of the crimes and weakne&s;&s;es of &s;overeigns, which are not cen&s;ured in the following extracts of Scripture:</P>

<P>I am not prepared to give to this matter the con&s;ideration it de&s;erves; I &s;hall only add here to what is &s;aid above, the following particulars, as they are brought together by the prophet Ezekiel: A &s;overeign &s;hall grant an e&s;tate of inheritance, of his own lands, to his own &s;ons only; grants of land to his mini&s;ters and favourites &s;hall be for a term not to exceed &s;even years, at the end of which they &s;hall revert to the prince; thus his dignity was pro|vided for, and the charges on the people for its &s;upport, and that of his family, if not prevented, would increa&s;e with much le&s;s rapidity; while a dangerous accumulation of property in the crown would be probably hindered; a provi&s;ion which &s;eems to have been wanted in the in&s;titutions of the nations who &s;ettled in Europe, on the different portions of the ruins of the Roman empire. A prince likewi&s;e was not to be made heir to one of his &s;ubjects, it may be &s;een in the Roman hi&s;tory, how a contrary cu&s;tom permitted by law was perverted to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t tyranny. Ezek. xlvi. 16, 17, 18. and Tacitus de Vit. Agr. &amp; alibi. Such are the prohibitions we find. The following are commands or maxims of ju&s;tice, piety, or policy, for princes. <Q>The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, he that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God. <BIBL>2 Chron. xxiii. 3.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On the qualifications requi&s;ite to governors&mdash;<Q>I am under&s;tanding&mdash;by me princes rule, and no|bles, even all the judges of the earth. <BIBL>Prov. viii. 15.</BIBL></Q></P>

<P>And we &s;hould enter very far into practical details, if we were to accumulate all the texts to be found of this kind, and to take the principles of many mea&s;ures greatly prai&s;ed in the Scripture, and arrange them as &s;criptural maxims of policy.</P></NOTE>

<P>Among the Jews, at the cri&s;is of which I have given you an account, the effects of the perverted and fanatical doctrines of liberty were increa&s;ed by a degeneracy of manners and of morals, and, indeed, in the mid&s;t of a degene|rating community, the&s;e principles, the germ of which is always latent in many &s;anguine and irregular di&s;po&s;itions and under&s;tandings, in every nation and age, are frequently found to &s;pring up with pernicious luxuriance; and are zealou&s;ly fo&s;tered by tho&s;e who hope to &s;helter their crimes, or repair their extravagance under their protection and outrage. And although this nation be not di&s;honourably di&s;tingui&s;hed among the nations of the earth, in morality or manners, yet wealth and pro&s;perity have not failed to produce their u&s;ual effects among us, in a degree too exten&s;ive; tho&s;e of the higher rank in &s;o|ciety often think it a privilege peculiarly attached to them, to &s;et no bounds to their gratifications; and to leave the vices and follies of their inferiors behind them, at a di&s;tance at lea&s;t proportional to that of their &s;tation; and as the &s;pace between them and ruin is a little greater, they increa&s;e their endeavours in the requi&s;ite degree, to enable them to fini&s;h their cour&s;e in the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>What numbers do we &s;ee, in the middle and a&s;cending cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, who, having their appetites whetted by the invidious view of the enjoyments of tho&s;e above them, dare to imitate them, and pre&s;s forward with emulation to be undone? purcha&s;ing thus a &s;hort period, alternately chequered with un|enjoyed feveri&s;h riot, and tho&s;e intervals when bitterne&s;s of anxiety for the fu|ture &s;hall corrode as poi&s;on in the bo&s;om, and the gird of &s;ecret &s;hame &s;hall be as when one cutteth a nerve, at the &s;ad price of penury and di&s;tre&s;s, and the conflict of inflamed appetite with utter privation and contempt.</P>
<P>And among men of lower &s;ituation, this folly or this guilt has involved mul|titudes, with their families, in the want of nece&s;&s;aries, and rendered them in|capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without depredations and crimes. This diffu&s;ed and mi|&s;erable depravity has &s;trength enough to lead men to the perpetration of &s;uch actions for their relief, which no illu&s;ion of their own under&s;tandings can pal|liate, no guilty &s;ophi&s;t will fabricate an apology for; no formed party will de|fend in concert; execrated and pro&s;cribed by the whole body of &s;ociety, and pur&s;ued and avenged by its united force. How mu&s;t it therefore open the unexerci&s;ed, half pre-di&s;po&s;ed mind to the reception of fal&s;ified and perverted principles, with a broad glare of delu&s;ion flung round them, and corrupted to de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of regular government, to which they are already al|mo&s;t

It is hardly in any mind, that the error it wi&s;hes to be true, is not an overmatch for that truth which calls for great &s;acrifices, except in that of the man of virtue: but the&s;e men are lo&s;t to virtue, and many of them to the la&s;t faint de&s;ire of recovering it.</P>

Inte&s;tine di&s;cord and public mi&s;ery are the natural con&s;equences of the prevalence of the&s;e principles and vices: and we generally find, that when they obtain in a nation, all external circum&s;tances either have, or &s;oon acquire, that arrangement which gives them full effect.</P>
<P>To this catalogue of evils prevailing among us, another is to be added, to which much of the extent and prevalence of the re&s;t may be traced up: whatever may be the di&s;tingui&s;hed good qualities of the pre&s;ent age, and it certainly does not want &s;ome, an attention to and a zeal in matters of religion is not among the number. This complaint, although it be as much di&s;regarded, as if the truth of it were of little con&s;equence, or its fal&s;ity evident, admits of a proof. In general conver&s;ation, at any period, we are &s;ure to hear frequent mention made of tho&s;e principles which are then in general prevalence and e&s;teem; but at this day, in reckoning up the good qualities of tho&s;e who are mentioned with e&s;teem, their piety is &s;eldom enumerated; a proof both that it is of little e&s;timation with the generality of &s;peakers, and of their opinion that they expect that it will make but a &s;mall favourable impre&s;&s;ion on the hearers. Now piety is the principle of life to moral virtue; it is where there is a &s;incere and zealous attachment to the truths of religion, and an awful and deep &s;en&s;e of its &s;anctions are ingrafted upon the mind, that the fruit of good works is to be expected. How &s;hould an attachment to virtue be wrought as deeply into the heart of man, as it might be, unle&s;s he expects with reve|rential and confirmed belief, that the happine&s;s of eternity &s;hall be its reward? the nece&s;&s;ity of this does not appear to be attended to as it ought, for Chri&s;ti|anity teaches us that this life is a &s;tate of moral education and trial; it would therefore be contrary to the latter end of our being placed here, if Providence
<PB N="20" REF="21">
had fenced human virtue round with any &s;uperfluous &s;trength of defence. It is of the e&s;&s;ence of &s;uch a &s;tate, that it &s;hould &s;tand in need of the aid of every principle favourable to it, to be barely &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, and that in the utmo&s;t degree of vigour an a&s;&s;iduous cultivation can bring it to. It fol|lows, that he who believes in Chri&s;tianity mu&s;t admit the nece&s;&s;ity of impre&s;&s;ing profoundly on his mind a &s;en&s;e, that the happine&s;s of eternity &s;hall be the re|ward of virtue; eternal puni&s;hment the retribution of all ungodline&s;s and un|righteou&s;ne&s;s of man, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ufficient attachment to the for|mer: for if any man believe, both that human virtue could be &s;ufficiently &s;e|cure in this &s;tate of probation and education, which is the great end of our being placed here, without that frequent meditation on future rewards and pu|ni&s;hments, which &s;hall &s;o imprint them in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of his mind, that they become habitually pre&s;ent to it as the con&s;tant motive to good actions; and likewi&s;e in the truth and reality of &s;anctions of religion, he mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, believe them &s;omething more than nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch a &s;tate of pro|bation; that is, that they are &s;uperfluous to the great plan of Providence which re&s;pects mankind.</P>
<P>It is from an attentive meditation on the &s;anctions of the divine law alone, that we can acquire the genuine and a &s;incere &s;pirit of piety; tho&s;e virtues which it generates or fo&s;ters modify human actions in every thing, and thus it greatly tends to form the character of man as a citizen; and the &s;pirit of nations, through the medium of the private characters it forms: and although I may have already exceeded the limits cu&s;tom &s;eems to have pre&s;cribed to the extent of our in&s;tructions to our congregations, I &s;hall not leave this important truth in &s;uch general terms, but enter &s;omewhat into the particular illu&s;tration to it. How far religion teaches us to obey our &s;overeign and the magi&s;trate has been before &s;tated, and I mean not to re&s;ume it; but, as far as I can, to weed out of the mind any lurking jealou&s;y again&s;t an unre&s;erved obedience to its dictates, by &s;howing how, at the &s;ame time, it tends to pre&s;erve the noble and ingenuous &s;pirit of liberty, in that temperate and healthy &s;tate, which make it the ble&s;&s;ing we admire.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t con&s;ider the con&s;equence of the fir&s;t of its principles, the evangelical &s;pirit of charity; with our equals this virtue draws clo&s;er every bond of con|nection, and multiplies their number; her conde&s;cen&s;ion makes her extend her arms to rai&s;e her inferior nearer to her: the attraction of the candid deference of her manners makes her &s;uperiors wi&s;h to dimini&s;h the di&s;tance of their &s;ta|tion. All are drawn nearer to all, and &s;ociety is held more clo&s;ely together, and that by mutual love, not danger, it forms a reticulated ma&s;s extending every way, in which the cords are multiplied, &s;trengthened, braced, above, around, beneath; and every rude &s;hock of external violence is more in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly and acutely felt through the whole. It thus acquires its be&s;t com|pactne&s;s and union; it keeps danger of every &s;hape more at a di&s;tance; it gains an increa&s;ed re&s;pect from its governors, whom confidence in it&s;elf, joined with the &s;pirit on which its increa&s;ed union is founded, will teach it to repay, with that nobler &s;ubjection dignifying the giver and receiver, which &s;prings from love.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">The love of our country is derived from the love of our countrymen; it is the plea&s;ure of that &s;en&s;ation which imagination attaches to tho&s;e objects of inanimate nature they call theirs; makes the mild azure of our &s;kies more lovely to us; adds a new elegance of tint to the &s;prightly and tender verdure of the &s;ummer; gives new beauty to the undulated variety of hill and valley; &s;trengthening every con&s;tituent motive to that fa&s;cinated attachment to our na|tive &s;oil, which wins its way unto the ingenuous bo&s;om, and interweaves it&s;elf &s;o with every earthly affection, that they can only have one common pe|riod; that charity which knits us into clo&s;er bonds of affection to each other, individually, mu&s;t increa&s;e the force of that &s;entiment which binds us to the whole, collectively, or the love of our country as a country; it not only aug|ments this patriotic pa&s;&s;ion, it purifies its ends, directs its exertions, and ele|vates it to the whole nobility of its nature.</P>
<P>On the other hand it is to be ob&s;erved, that uncharitable and di&s;cordant ha|bits of mind repel man from man; it is by external compre&s;&s;ion, not mutual attraction, that the individuals of &s;uch a &s;ociety can be forced into a tran&s;itory and hollow &s;emblance of union; and even then, the effect of this vice di|mini&s;hes and tends to de&s;troy the effect of &s;uch external pre&s;&s;ure by the whole of its own &s;trength.</P>
<P>The duty of temperance de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be con&s;idered in this point of view, both in conjunction with &s;ome others and &s;imply. Now temperance is the health of the &s;oul in as eminent a degree as of her mechanic in&s;trument the body. Re&s;traint from acts of &s;en&s;uality pre&s;erves the intellectual faculties of rea&s;on and imagination in their firme&s;t tone of vigour; it prevents al&s;o many pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, and anxiety for the future, and &s;elf-reproach, the heavy clogs of its operations; purifying, not enervating our de&s;ires, it lightens the mind, and rendering it free for action, increa&s;es that appetite for it which Pro|vidence has planted in our nature; it al&s;o precludes mo&s;t of the mi&s;applications of it, and thereby confines it very &s;tongly into a tract &s;uitable to the dignity of a moral agent: and here piety again interferes, and among other duties points out a new &s;et of objects, in which &s;ome of the fine&s;t energies of the intel|lectual faculties will be gratified by being exerci&s;ed in their mo&s;t favourite oc|cupations; what&s;oever things are of good report, religion will point out to them as a proper &s;cope of their pur&s;uit; if there be any prai&s;e, we &s;hall me|ditate on the&s;e things, that we may in all things adorn the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. But the good report and prai&s;e of &s;ociety is generally very wi&s;ely be&s;towed; whatever tends to ameliorate its condition, receives the large&s;t and mo&s;t &s;plen|did &s;hare of it: and if they be thus governed by that Wi&s;dom that is from above, every art and every &s;cience that does honour to a people, and renders it powerful and happy, would proceed in a much more rapid march toward farther perfection; our vallies and hills would &s;tand &s;o thick with corn, that they would laugh and &s;ing; the feet of our cattle would be be&s;ide all waters; the bricks would fall down, and our hou&s;es be built of hewn &s;tone; and in|&s;tead of the &s;ycamore, the beams thereof &s;hould be of the goodly cedar tree: that guiding Spirit that teacheth us to add to our faith knowledge, will lead on the human mind to the undi&s;covered tracts of nature, multiplying the pro|vinces of &s;cience, and augmenting the utility of its dominion over tho&s;e already
<PB N="22" REF="23">
acquired; and whatever adds beauty to u&s;e, poli&s;hed decorum to &s;ociety, and grace to virtue, would become day by day more and more their own. The&s;e things adorn a &s;tate and increa&s;e the attachment of its members to it, by ren|dering them happier in it. The&s;e are the honours of the nations of the earth, and every man will feel his &s;hare of the public honour to be his own; hence the love of the land in which we fir&s;t drew the breath of life receives a new acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength from them.</P>
<P>Let us take a view of the rever&s;e of this: di&s;tre&s;s and depravity are two fol|lowers which generally dog intemperance and &s;en&s;uality clo&s;e at the heels; and when the bait is the relief of their nece&s;&s;ities, and fre&s;h materials for the in|dulgence of their criminal lu&s;ts, to be obtained in the hour of rapine and atrocity; when &s;ociety undergoes a violent change, they prepare the minds of men to the reception of any perverted principle; and the turpitude of that hypocri&s;y which pretends to delu&s;ion without being deluded, and to that frontle&s;s profli|gacy that dares the day, and &s;corns the &s;lighte&s;t veil of pretence for evil;&mdash; &s;uch men every bad cau&s;e attracts equally, and finds among them a band of ruffians ready to be enrolled in its &s;ervice, whether it be that of tyranny tram|pling down the fences of ju&s;tice and every &s;alutary re&s;traint upon power, or of tho&s;e not le&s;s iniquitous men, who, in the language of St. Peter, "de&s;pi&s;e government;" "and while they promi&s;e others liberty, are them&s;elves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. c. ii. v. 10 and 19.</NOTE> the &s;ervants of corruption," drawing the &s;word again&s;t equitable dominion, and &s;overeigns whom the laws of God and man command them to honour.</P>
<P>The day which &s;ubjects us to the vile captivities of &s;in and appetite, almo&s;t annihilates the nobler principle which con&s;titutes us men: the temperate po&s;|&s;e&s;s their minds undebilitated, with no &s;trong attraction to bow them down to earth they walk erectly; and among &s;uch mu&s;t be found, at lea&s;t, the greater number of tho&s;e who, ju&s;t and tenacious of ju&s;t purpo&s;es, cannot be bia&s;&s;ed or forced from the fair and &s;traight line of public duty, by the frown and uplifted arm of oppre&s;&s;ive power, or &s;wept along in the torrent and rage of the multitude, precipitating them&s;elves and every thing el&s;e into de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this re&s;traint in the gratifications of &s;en&s;e, there are other propen&s;ities which religion puts under the &s;ame limitations; it requires us to be temperate in the pur&s;uits of &s;elf-intere&s;t, of honour, in the exerci&s;e of ju&s;t indignation, and in the whole detail of regulations laid upon us, forms a complete &s;y&s;tem of &s;elf-government; the noble&s;t power man can exerci&s;e, to which it is one de|&s;ign of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to rai&s;e all his true di&s;ciples, as nearly as the im|perfect condition of humanity admits. And I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with con&s;idering the con&s;equences to a nation, the individuals of which had acquired this great moral quality in no inferior degree.</P>
<P>The manners of &s;uch people will render them capable of being governed by a milder and more liberal &s;y&s;tem of laws; for the more &s;trongly a man's inward principles re&s;train him from deviating from his duty, the le&s;s external coercion will he require to be made to continue in it; and the &s;ame principle may be extended to political &s;ocieties: they are to be kept in the bounds of &s;ocial duty
<PB N="23" REF="24">
by the united re&s;traints of &s;elf-government and national law;<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Where the individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;elf-government, there will be an exterior regularity of manners; but the conver&s;e is not true: they may conceal avarice, fraud, malignity, all the vices of a cold di&s;&s;ocial temperament; he wants &s;ome of the highe&s;t functions of &s;elf-government.&mdash;To nations in which &s;uch characters are common, what is to be &s;aid will not apply?</NOTE> increa&s;e the power of the fir&s;t, and the rigour of the &s;econd may be abated by the &s;ame quantity, and an adequate effect be produced by their joint operations; de|crea&s;e it, and the weight of its &s;upplement, or the coercion of law, mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in the &s;ame manner: this applies, indeed, only to general per&s;onal freedom; yet it has been the intere&s;t of &s;overeigns to fo&s;ter this &s;pecies of free|dom, becau&s;e they have found an immediate acce&s;&s;ion to their own authority; and for that purpo&s;e, it is a cour&s;e which has been &s;y&s;tematically pur&s;ued by many, even if we &s;hould not admit &s;omething like action and re-action be|tween the exerci&s;e of &s;overeign power and the manners of a people, each con|&s;iderably modifying the other.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition from per&s;onal to civil freedom &s;eems almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary: the wi&s;e and the good will look forward to it as a &s;econd great end; every mind is drawn toward it by their authority, and by the analogy, or rather identity of the principles of each &s;y&s;tem; and the general opinion thus formed, and thus conducted, will lead &s;uch a nation on by &s;ober &s;teps, and &s;uccceding each other at due intervals, to the attainment of a con&s;titution where the &s;eeming di&s;cor|dant elements of effective authority and public freedom &s;hall be &s;o blended and harmoni&s;ed together, that the re&s;ult &s;hall be the happine&s;s of the &s;overeign and the people; a termination of the natural progre&s;s of &s;uch a &s;ociety, which nothing &s;eems capable of preventing, but the bu&s;y ra&s;hne&s;s which &s;hall attempt to hurry it on prematurely.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion is fortified likewi&s;e by that well-e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that the con&s;titution of nature, as far as it re&s;pects moral agents, is moral, and on the &s;ide of virtue; and this is true as well of nations as of individuals. Now natural religion teaches us, that this con&s;titution is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the decree of God, as the ordinary &s;y&s;tem of his admini&s;tration. Permanent national happine&s;s is the natural reward of permanent national virtue; and without a well-con&s;tituted government, &s;uch happine&s;s cannot take place.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the tendencies of &s;elf-government to improve our civil &s;tate; and where it takes place, it will lead a &s;ociety forward without precipitancy or convul&s;ion, to every improvement which, in its exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, it is mature to receive; and wherever a virtuous, deliberate wi&s;dom, following that light, which, a&s;cending, &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day, may progre&s;&s;ively call it, "for where the &s;pirit of the Lord is," there is dutiful obedience to tho&s;e whom he hath &s;et over us; and "there is liberty:"<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. c. iii. v. 17. John c. viii. v. 31, 32.</NOTE> for our Saviour him&s;elf hath promi&s;ed us, that tho&s;e who are "his di&s;ciples, indeed, &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make them free."</P>
<P>I &s;hall dwell but little on the conver&s;e of this repre&s;entation. To illu&s;trate the connection of &s;elf-government and national liberty with more &s;implicity, it had been facitly admitted, that the rigour of laws mu&s;t increa&s;e with no greater celerity than the power of &s;elf-government decrea&s;es; which &s;uppo&s;es,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
that the &s;trength and &s;timulation of the pa&s;&s;ions are in both ca&s;es the &s;ame; or that they gain no additional force from the habit of unre&s;trained indulgence. But it is evident, that as the power of &s;elf-re&s;traint dimini&s;hes, the pa&s;&s;ions grow up into a vitiated magnitude, and acquire a &s;everi&s;h and di&s;temperate force; and to obtain a proper counterbalance for them, in this declining &s;tate of manners, the rigour of laws mu&s;t be augmented more than the habit of &s;elf-government is decrea&s;ed; and the nece&s;&s;ary order of &s;ociety will exact a &s;y&s;tem of laws &s;o jealou&s;ly rigid, and a &s;pirit of admini&s;tration &s;o adapted to them, re&s;trictions mu&s;t be multiplied to guard &s;o many points, which, in a whole&s;ome &s;tate of public morals might be left open, that per&s;onal liberty, if not anni|hilated, will be greatly circum&s;cribed; and when men have lo&s;t &s;o e&s;timable an end, for which the great machine of a free con&s;titution is formed, they will grow indifferent about the balance and functions of its &s;eparate parts, and, indeed, about its exi&s;tence. In vain may the &s;kilful arti&s;t have rai&s;ed a temple, which freedom might chu&s;e to place her name therein, and deck the porches thereof and the courts of the in&s;ide of her hou&s;e with perfect beauty, in the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding; in vain &s;hall it boa&s;t it&s;elf, and &s;ay, my builders have perfected my beauty. Although the nations &s;hall admire the excellency of thy &s;plendor, and the ends of the whole earth &s;hall long to tread the pavements of thy courts; if, as the generations pa&s;s away, thy beams become rottenne&s;s, and the worm preyeth upon them, the cement of thy walls become as untempered mortar, and thy marble as unbaked brick, thou &s;halt fall without a bla&s;t to &s;hake thee, and thy ruin no man &s;hall rai&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered the nature of that danger which calls for our pre&s;ent vigilance, and many of the evils which this day call for our repentance; and they are &s;o widely extended, that they may be called national: the calamities they bring upon a nation I have &s;hown hi&s;torically, from a &s;eries of events &s;o far connected with our religion, as to be a continuation of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory of the people of God; and to exhibit a completion of a great prophecy of our Saviour, the&s;e calamities have been afterwards proved, upon general principles, to be the natural effects of tho&s;e perverted maxims and manners of the Jews in that age, which are &s;imilar to tho&s;e which have been of late &s;preading in this country, and not circum&s;tances of that nation, which have a bare acciden|tal connection by happening at the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion to be drawn from the whole, is, that if with them, we follow where the &s;ame &s;pirit of fanatical delu&s;ion would lead us, if we tread in the foot&s;teps of their iniquities, the natural con&s;equence of it mu&s;t come upon us, &s;ufferings &s;imilar to their puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, be&s;eech Almighty God to work into our hearts that peni|tence for our pa&s;t errors and iniquities, which may find acceptance with him; and that he will grant us the &s;uccour of his holy &s;pirit to lead us, in this our day, in the way of tho&s;e things which make for our peace; and that he will remove the mi&s;t from their eyes who cannot di&s;cern them.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o commanded to pray for tho&s;e who de&s;pitefully u&s;e us and per|&s;ecute us: let us, therefore, offer up our petitions to God in behalf of that deceived and guilty nation, who&s;e crimes and calamities &s;trike us with a&s;ton|ni&s;hment.&mdash; O, thou who fille&s;t the heaven above and the earth beneath, and

all the worlds that thou ha&s;t created, with thy goodne&s;s; who, in the deeps of that eternal darkne&s;s which was before they began, commanded&s;t the light to be, and it was; who called on thy &s;un to come from his glorious chamber of the ea&s;t, and he came forth; let the diviner beams of thy heavenly truth, to which this lower light is as darkne&s;s, pierce through that thick cloud with which a lying &s;pirit has blinded their eyes, in clo&s;ing them round with the night of the &s;hadow of death; vi&s;it their &s;ouls again with thy day-&s;pring from on high. Lord of all power and might, who&s;e voice is heard by the whirlwind that &s;haketh the wilderne&s;s of Cades, and the branch thereof moveth no more; who ruleth the &s;torm, and the raging of the &s;ea, and the waves thereof are laid a&s;leep upon its gla&s;&s;y untroubled bo&s;om; who &s;aye&s;t unto the angel who rideth in the red and fervid cloud of thy wrath, and &s;catters pe&s;tilence on the inha|bitants of the earth, return thine arrows into the quiver, and he who had &s;ickened unto death, drinks again in his &s;trength of the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morn|ing, breathed from the hills of Sharon; let thy mercy and thy power compo&s;e this tempe&s;t of the rage, the crimes, and the madne&s;s of the people into peace; &s;trike their hearts, O Lord, with dete&s;tation for their pa&s;t iniquities! remove from them all hardne&s;s of heart and de&s;pair of mercy, that they plunge no further in blood; and teach them, by &s;uch repentance and amendment that &s;hall be lea&s;t unequal to the atrocity of their guilt, to flee from the wrath to come. Grant this, O Lord, to the merits and mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour, who came into this world to e&s;tabli&s;h peace and good-will among mankind, and &s;uffered the death of the cro&s;s to redeem us from all our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.
