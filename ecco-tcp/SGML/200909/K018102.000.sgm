<L>That honour's lo&s;s will be thy gain.</L>
<L>This honour would not let thee &s;ing,</L>

<L>Such loyal monitor would &s;trike thee dumb,</L>

<HEAD>The Gibbet Simile.</HEAD>

<L>But be n't afraid, 'tis all in &s;port,</L>
<L>And thou'lt receive but little hurt.</L>
<L>Nay, in this game thou'lt be the only winner,</L>
<L>For thou, not I, wilt carry off the dinner.</L>

<L>Peter, I like not &s;hooting in the dark,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e not one in three may hit thy mark.</L>
<L>Give me that open day-light rebel poet</L>
<L>Who tells his name, nor cares if all men know it.</L>
<L>But thou behind this Pindar's ma&s;k art &s;nug</L>
<L>As biting vermin latent clo&s;e in rug,</L>
<L>By Gods unnam'd, by Briti&s;h men clep'd&mdash;bug.</L>
<L>Yes; this bu&s;h-fight</L>
<L>Is thy delight.</L>
<L>How oft like coward &s;avage ha&s;t thou laid</L>
<L>In dark and &s;ilent nightly ambu&s;cade,</L>
<L>Thy &s;piteful feather'd &s;haft to wing</L>
<L>And wound the heart of G&mdash;e thy K&mdash;g,</L>

<L>Such cowardly attack</L>
<L>I never will forgive;</L>

<L>I've more to add&mdash;which further &s;till will grate;</L>
<L>For tho' thou art a witty fellow,</L>
<L>With thee I never will be mellow:</L>
<L>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ever were my mortal hate.</L>
<L>Yes; now more &s;eriou&s;ly I come to think,</L>
<L>I mu&s;t recall my former ha&s;ty motion;</L>
<L>If e'er with rebel rogues like thee I drink,</L>
<L>May baneful juice of hemlock be my potion.</L>
<L>Moreover, Peter; if the Fates decree</L>
<L>That judgment mu&s;t o'ertake both thee and me</L>
<L>For this our crime</L>
<L>Of wicked rhyme;</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="61">If thou and I mu&s;t both be &s;hipp'd away,</L>
