<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A De&s;ire of collecting into one view, the ob&s;ervations and opi|nions of former writers, on the Hi&s;tory and Antiquities of Northumberland, fir&s;t induced me to make this compilation; for &s;uch with the utmo&s;t deference, I mu&s;t call it.</P>
<P>The utility of a work of this kind, to the generality of readers, is obvious; as a competent knowledge of the county may be at|tained, without the labour and expence of turning over many volumes, from whence my authorities were deduced.</P>
<P>I have added de&s;criptions of remarkable objects, in their pre|&s;ent &s;tate, with drawings of &s;ome of the principal ones; and have endeavoured to pre&s;erve a &s;trict impartiality through the whole.</P>
<P>There are inter&s;per&s;ed through the work many original pa|pers, found among the manu&s;cripts of the late Antiquary, Roger Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> communicated to me by a particular friend; in which the reader will find &s;everal ob&s;ervations, made by him and his learned corre&s;pondents,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr John Hor&s;ley, Mr John Warburton, Sir John Clerk, Mr Robert Cay, Mr Maurice John&s;on, Dr Stukeley, the Rev.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the following de&s;criptive <HI>View</HI> of the county of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> it appears nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of the Roman po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this territory; and to collect into a &s;eparate chronological cla&s;s, the &s;tate of regal authority therein, under the Saxon heptarchy.</P>
<P>The kingdom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of <HI>Aelle,</HI> compre|hended the two Briti&s;h provinces of <HI>Bernicia</HI> and <HI>Deira;</HI> and extended from the rivers Mer&s;ey and Humber on the &s;outh, to Liddi&s;dale, Cheviot Hills, and the river Tweed on the north; and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from the German Ocean to the Iri&s;h Channel.</P>
<P>The etymologies given by Camden of the name of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> are from the Saxon Nor&wyn;anhumbra ric, the kingdom of Northumberland, and Nor&wyn;an|humber-lond, lands north of Humber.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Et regiones omnes quae trans Humbrum ae&s;tuarium ad &s;eptentriones jacent, Saxonico nomine Nor&wyn;an Humbra ric, i. e. Nordanhumbrorum regnum vocari caeperunt.</P>

<BIBL>Camden Brit. p. 623.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;cene of my attention in this work, is that part only of this exten&s;ive territory, which retains the name <HI>Northumberland;</HI> bounded towards the ea&s;t by the German Ocean, towards the we&s;t by the county of Cumberland, to|wards the north by the river Tweed and the &s;hire of Roxborough, and towards the &s;outh by the county palatine of Durham.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict, at the time the <HI>Romans</HI> fir&s;t entered it, was inhabited by the <HI>Otadini</HI> towards the ea&s;t, and the <HI>Gadeni</HI> on the we&s;tern and maintainous parts. It is pre&s;umed the&s;e invaders had not advanced &s;o far northward as Northum|berland, before the third year of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s command in Britain. According to Tacitus's account, he came over in the character of Legate, in the year 78, when the &s;ummer was far advanced; that this dignity was conferred upon him immediately after his Con&s;ul&s;hip, which by the <HI>Fa&s;ti Con&s;ulares</HI> appears to have been in the year 77: &s;o that the reduction of Northumberland by the Roman ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, happened in the year 80. The Romans did not totally de&s;ert this i&s;land
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
till the middle of the fifth century, and they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;tations is Nor|thumberland to the la&s;t; con&s;equently their continuance there was for a &s;eries of near 370 years.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;ley Brit. Rom. lib. I. cha. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Agricola,</HI> it is well known, in his rece&s;&s;ion from the bu&s;ine&s;s of warfare, &s;tudied to introduce the Roman habit and luxury among the Britons: as a good Poli|tician, conceiving that whil&s;t the&s;e plea&s;ures fa&s;cinated, they al&s;o enervated and relaxed, rendering the natives le&s;s ferocious, and ea&s;ier to be conciliated or &s;ub|dued; and would al&s;o promote the future wealth of a <HI>province,</HI> of which he had the honour to compleat the conque&s;t, by urging the inhabitants to extend their trade: plea&s;ures and luxuries introduce artificial wants, which arts, manufac|tures, commerce, and navigation mu&s;t &s;upply.</P>
<P>The&s;e new enjoyments were of a &s;hort exi&s;tence, for in the cour&s;e of the fourth century after <HI>Agricola</HI>'s command, the natives were left expo&s;ed to the ravages of barbarous nations, no longer kept in awe by the Roman arms.</P>
<P>The unhappy e&s;tate of the northern inhabitants, after they were totally de|&s;erted by the Romans, is ea&s;ily conceived; the perils and mi&s;eries to which they were frequently expo&s;ed, by the incur&s;ions of tribes of Picts and Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, na|turally induces a belief, that the principal part of tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of riches, merchandi&s;e, flocks, and herds, would immediately retire, and &s;eek for &s;afer and more peaceful habitations, in the &s;outhern parts of the land. The ravagers &s;till advanced, and the wretchedne&s;s of the Britons was &s;o greatly in|crea&s;ed, that they were driven to &s;eek refuge in the mountains, and conceal them&s;elves in their fore&s;ts and caverns. Such was the deplorable &s;ituation of the natives in the year 449, when they implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a brave and warlike people inured to arms.</P>
<P>Our Hi&s;torians, with a di&s;graceful partiality, have &s;tigmatized the <HI>Saxons</HI> with the epithets of cruelty and inju&s;tice, in order to extenuate the errors of the Britons, or to palliate their de&s;picable impotence.</P>
<P>It manife&s;tly appears, that under the protection of the Romans, the Britons had &s;unk into &s;upinene&s;s and depravity; public virtues were extingui&s;hed, and an abjectne&s;s of &s;pirit univer&s;ally prevailed. They &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adors to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> thus commi&s;&s;ioned:</P>
<P><Q>Mo&s;t noble <HI>Saxons.</HI> We the wretched and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Britons,</HI> worn our by the con&s;tant incur&s;ions of our cruel and mercile&s;s enemies, and becau&s;e we have heard of the fame of tho&s;e glorious victories which by your valour you have obtained; therefore have we &s;ent our humble &s;uppliants to you, to im|plore
<PB N="v" REF="6">
your kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We have large and plentiful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, abound|ing with every nece&s;&s;ary; the&s;e with our&s;elves, we &s;ubmit to your di&s;po&s;al, if you will generou&s;ly lend us your &s;uccour again&s;t our inveterate foes. Long have we enjoyed the &s;weets of peace, under the powerful protection of the Roman arms, and now we know none &s;econd in glory to them, but your|&s;elves: therefore to you we lift up our hands for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in return are willing to abide whatever &s;ervice you &s;hall impo&s;e upon us.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Witichindus Ge&s;t. Sax. lib. I.</P>
<P>Some authors &s;ay the Saxons were not invited over by the Britons, but being exiled from their own country, landed here. But Mannius, in particular, does not &s;hew any proof for this a&s;&s;ertion, from the &s;ituation of the German &s;tates in that aera.</P>
<P>Ver&s;tigan, from the authority of Pomarius, &s;ays 9000 Saxons came over. Hector Boethius &s;ays they were 10,000 in number, and were tran&s;ported in 30 &s;hips.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Why &s;hould we di&s;credit this Hi&s;torian, when the former petitions made to the Roman &s;tate were equally as abject. <Q>To <HI>Aetius</HI> thrice Con&s;ul. The groans of the <HI>Britains.</HI> The <HI>Barbarians</HI> drive us to the &s;ea, the &s;ea forces us back again upon the Barbarians; in the&s;e dreadful extremities, death awaits us equally on both &s;ides, either we mu&s;t fall by the hands of our enemies, or el&s;e be drowned in the &s;welling waves.</Q></P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Thanet</HI> was allotted to the&s;e new allies, and it was not long before they rendered &s;ignal &s;ervices to the Britons. The northern ravagers, with a mighty band, were advanced into Lincoln&s;hire; the <HI>Saxons</HI> with alacrity took the field; Hi&s;torians agree, the victory obtained over the invaders near <HI>Stamford,</HI> was only to be attributed to the military prowe&s;s and &s;kilful di&s;po&s;itions of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>A people recovering from a &s;tate of de&s;pair, are apt to advance to exce&s;s in their love and gratitude towards their redeemers. After the ravagers were thus di&s;comfited, and had retired into the north, the <HI>Saxons</HI> were looked upon with the highe&s;t veneration: and in order effectually to repre&s;s the northern nations, an additional band of <HI>Saxons</HI> were petitioned for, and a greater extent of terri|tory granted for their re&s;idence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Scotch writers &s;ay this reinforcement con&s;i&s;ted of 5000 men.</NOTE> So happy were the Britons in their new alli|ance, that <HI>Vortergern</HI> their Prince e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Rowena,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> the Saxon General.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances evidently prove, the <HI>Saxons</HI> were invited hither to partake the land and become &s;ettlers, as it doth not appear from any admi&s;&s;ible autho|rity, that any other gratuity <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede</HI> and <HI>Ethelwerd</HI> are &s;ilent, as to any promi&s;es of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion made by the natives. <HI>Gildas</HI> &s;ays their fir&s;t pretence of quarrelling was for a greater <HI>allowance.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Gildas</HI> is <HI>epimenia, a Roman team for the pay of a &s;oldier.</HI> In <HI>Bede</HI> it is <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ionae,</HI> which is con&s;trued <HI>the produce of lands, pro|vi&s;ions of corn,</HI> &amp;c.

The <HI>Saxons</HI> were not applied to, till the country was almo&s;t totally lo&s;t or become d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ert;
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
&s;o that providing them &s;ettlements, was giving even what the fugitive Britons could not hold. The county of <HI>Kent</HI> was the &s;econd e&s;tabli&s;hment granted to the&s;e allies.</P>
<P>So peculiarly frail and in&s;table by nature, were the di&s;po&s;itions of mind po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the natives, that no &s;ooner were they relieved from the mo&s;t abject &s;tate, and deplorable calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, than, in the moment of ea&s;e, they began to regard tho&s;e who had re&s;cued them with jealou&s;y, to be di&s;contented with their former re&s;olutions, to imagine future evils, and to devi&s;e projects of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ingratitude. The heroic <HI>Saxons</HI> received the intelligence with contempt, and looked upon the ingratitude with abhorrence. The mo&s;t abject mind the &s;oone&s;t conceives ingratitude: there is a ba&s;ene&s;s and illiberality in grovelling &s;ouls, which dete&s;ts a &s;en&s;e of obligations; the meane&s;t pea&s;ant hath the mo&s;t ungenerous &s;entiments; di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y are the i&s;&s;ue of vicious hearts; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is brutal, and characteri&s;tic of ignorance. On the other hand, hero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c minds are fired with virtues, for courage and fortitude are the re&s;ult of principle. The angry <HI>Saxons</HI> no &s;ooner beheld the in&s;tability of Briti&s;h faith and affection, than they began to devi&s;e the means of taking the reigns of go|vernment out of the hands of impotence. The name of <HI>King</HI> was yet unknown among the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who in emergencies of &s;tate cho&s;e an Heretogen, or <HI>General,</HI> who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e power and dignity &s;ub&s;ided with the occa&s;ion of his election. They knew no obligation to Sovereigns, their liberty was uncontaminated with the appen|dages of &s;upremacy. The royal dignity of <HI>Vortergein</HI> was by them e&s;teemed of little importance, and of much le&s;s utility.</P>
<P>The abjectne&s;s of the Britons was de&s;picable, and the <HI>Saxons</HI> contemplated it with contempt. The land before their arrival was ravaged by barbarous tribes, even the &s;outhern provinces were de&s;olated, and the natives driven to the fo|re&s;ts and mountains: they were no longer able to retain, or worthy to rule &s;o fertile a country. Such were the cau&s;es which induced the <HI>Saxons</HI> to devi&s;e means of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing the government.</P>
<P>Authors who impeach the <HI>Saxons</HI> of breach of public faith, overlook the terms on which they were invited hither, and the indignities and injuries they &s;u&s;tained before they turned their arms again&s;t the natives.

PRINCIPLES OF OUR INESTIMABLE CONSTITUTION. If we inherit any thing from the Britons, it con&s;i&s;ts of their <HI>ferocity, in&s;tability,</HI> and <HI>ingratitude.</HI> Without the Saxon arms, this i&s;land, like the regions of the ea&s;t, would have been over-run and de&s;olated by a banditti, wor&s;e than Tartars; and become a den of thieves, pirates, and robbers.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h Prince &s;till lived in a &s;tate of confidence and e&s;teem with his new ally; every one but <HI>Vortergern</HI> could di&s;cern the countenance of amity which <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> now a&s;&s;umed, was a &s;uperficial ma&s;k which covered his re&s;entment, through which in&s;incerity was ea&s;ily di&s;covered; and that protection was at length become his mo&s;t di&s;tant object. The Britons conceived, that from the time of <HI>Rowena</HI>'s e&s;pou&s;al, the <HI>Saxons</HI> put on an in&s;olent and contemptuous car|riage, which increa&s;ed their natural jealou&s;y again&s;t them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the <HI>Saxons</HI> ob&s;erved the government was involved in anarchy and confu&s;ion, the Briti&s;h &s;tates were di&s;tracted by factions and ca|bals, and each individual overwhelmed in de&s;pondency, and relaxed from all warlike di&s;po&s;ition. <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> fore&s;aw, that if he &s;hould withdraw his troops, this fine fertile land mu&s;t become a de&s;ert, under the ravages of tho&s;e barbarians, who were irre&s;i&s;tible by Briti&s;h force: the depopulation of the northern territo|ries, favoured an intention he had formed, as he conceived the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Northumberland</HI> would facilitate his &s;ubjugation of the Britons. In order to ef|fect this purpo&s;e, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ear of the Prince, he expatiated on the ra|vages con&s;tantly made by the northern nations, who, though lately repre&s;&s;ed, were again advancing to the interior parts of the country; he propo&s;ed, that a reinforcement of his countrymen &s;hould be invited to &s;ettle in tho&s;e de&s;olated di&s;tricts, at once to &s;ubdue the ferocious bands of robbers, and form a &s;afe|guard for the &s;outhern provinces. The plau&s;ibility of the project, the imbecility of <HI>Vortergern</HI>'s political judgment, the abjectne&s;s of &s;pirit which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h councils, and the wretchedne&s;s of the people, groaning under di&s;tre&s;s and the mi&s;eries con&s;equent to war, together with the implicit confidence with which the Prince li&s;tened to the admonitions of his confident, promi&s;ing a &s;afe and indolent reign under &s;uch protection, all concurred to promote the plan.</P>

<P>ALCFRED, the natural &s;on of <HI>O&s;wes,</HI> &s;ucceeded to the throne in the year 686. He had &s;pent his youth in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and according to the humour of tho&s;e times, had made religion his chief &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Picts</HI> in the preceding reign had obtained part of the northern territories of his predece&s;&s;ors; the mo&s;t of which he regained, and maintained his kingdom from further depredations.

<P><PB N="xxi" REF="22">He reigned 19 years, and died in the year 705.

<BIBL>Symeon Dunel. lib.

The common|wealth will always &s;uffer under an overheated zeal and enthu&s;ia&s;tic religion. The fir&s;t acceptable &s;ervice of man, is rectitude of manners; that he do his duty to him&s;elf, his family, his neighbour, and the &s;tate: a wretch who neglects all the&s;e, to be ince&s;&s;antly on his knees, lifting up the hands of idlene&s;s to hea|ven, purcha&s;es a heavy condemnation. The King was for ever at his devotions, his Nobles catched the infatuation, and conceiving that &s;elf-denial, mortifica|tion, and neglect of worldly concerns be&s;t plea&s;ed the Omnipotent, they founded religious hou&s;es, rai&s;ed churches, and took on them the mona&s;tic orders. Tho&s;e who &s;hould have appeared in the &s;everal departments of government, were &s;unk into cells, and the &s;tate lo&s;t its nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports: the influenza extended to the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of men, and tho&s;e who &s;hould have been found fit for arms and manuel employs, were lifting up long vi&s;ages and languid looks to heaven, as if the <HI>benevolent Being</HI> could only be plea&s;ed with ugly faces, di&s;tortions, and mi&s;ery. <HI>Ethelbald</HI> the King of <HI>Mercia</HI> ob&s;erving the unhappy condition of the neighbouring empire, determined to make his advantage of it, and with a powerful army entered <HI>Northumberland.</HI> He ravaged the borders, &s;acked and laid wa&s;te their cities, and loaden with &s;poils, returned in triumph: whil&s;t the Northumbrians, as idle &s;pectators, received their afflictions as the di&s;cipline and &s;courge of heaven, e&s;teeming them &s;alutary mortifications, wherein they &s;hould find &s;alvation. Anarchy and confu&s;ion took place, and the &s;tate was ha&s;tening into di&s;&s;olution, when the King, in a phren&s;y of zeal, after having reigned eight years, abdicated the throne, and offered his crown at the high altar in the ca|thedral church of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> where he a&s;&s;umed the <HI>Cowl.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib.

The entering into a &s;piritual character may at that time have been e&s;teemed an extinction of tem|poral rights, but by what right a <HI>Saxon King</HI> could di&s;po&s;e of his kingdom to another, I confe&s;s my&s;elf ignorant.</P>
<P>EGBERT a&s;cended the throne when the realm was in the mo&s;t relaxed and impotent &s;tate; all the adjoining powers were committing continual depredations on his &s;ubjects, who, like men of di&s;turbed rea&s;on, bowed their &s;imple heads to every affliction,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24">
and put their hands in their bo&s;oms void of &s;elf-defence: even the tributary &s;tates began to declare for freedom and independence; and to perfect the mi&s;ery of the realm, the Mercians were renewing the war.</P>
<P>How difficult a ta&s;k it was to rou&s;e the lethargic zealots from their fa&s;cina|tion, to take up arms, may ea&s;ily be conceived: at length <HI>Egbert</HI> di&s;ciplined and led forth a powerful army, and with great military prowe&s;s, brought the the malecontents to their duty, &s;ubdued the Picts and Britons who were in arms, and beat back the Mercians.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he relieved from the&s;e troubles, and peace &s;miled upon his reign, than catching the infatuation of the age, after reigning 21 years, he re|&s;igned his &s;overeignty, and a&s;&s;umed the character of a Monk.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;. lib.

<P>ETHELRED the &s;on of <HI>Ethelwald,</HI> was cho&s;en to &s;ucceed him; but his reign began with factions, either from the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e of royal de&s;cent, or from the moro&s;e di&s;po&s;ition which <HI>Ethelred</HI> di&s;played in his fir&s;t maxims of government; perhaps both tho&s;e cau&s;es operated to &s;tir up the &s;ucceeding rebellions. His Generals were unfortunate, and his arms un&s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the malecontents; at a place called <HI>Kings-cliff</HI> his troops were routed by the rebels, and <HI>Alduff</HI> his Ge|neral was &s;lain: and in a &s;econd battle, at a place called <HI>Holy-thorn,</HI> the rebels again prevailed.</P>
<P><HI>Ethelred</HI> &s;oon &s;aw him&s;elf de&s;erted, and the &s;tate in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion: in con&s;equence of which he thought it prudent to withdraw him&s;elf privily, and &s;ave his life, which he perceived was in imminent danger.</P>
<P><HI>Edelbald</HI> and <HI>Herebert,</HI> two noblemen of great influence, had headed the&s;e factions, and now perceiving there was no ob&s;tacle remaining, proceeded to place <HI>Alfwold,</HI> the brother of <HI>Alured,</HI> on the throne. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;. lib.

<P>ALFWOLD thus &s;upported, a&s;&s;umed the &s;cepter, no one pre&s;uming, in the turbulent e&s;tate of the kingdom, to oppo&s;e tho&s;e violent mea&s;ures. <HI>Alfwold</HI> was of an excel|lent di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o far from pre&s;uming to act oppre&s;&s;ively, in con&s;equence of the power by which he was &s;upported, that he tempered his government with mercy and ju&s;tice. So unhappy was the removal of the diadem from the royal line, and its di&s;po&s;ition on the nobility, that factions &s;oon were kindling in every di&s;trict, and di&s;&s;atisfactions breathing from every quarter: all the No|bles regarded them&s;elves as being publicly affronted, and that the election of <HI>Alfwold</HI> was to be con&s;idered as their di&s;paragement. The excellencies and vir|tues of the King were totally di&s;regarded; they rather aggravated than &s;erved to conciliate: at length the people ro&s;e up in open rebellion, and a con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t his life. <HI>Alfwold</HI> had reigned about ten years, when he was trea|cherou&s;ly &s;lain by <HI>Sigga,</HI> a chief of the con&s;pirators, and one whom he retained about his per&s;on.

<P>ETHELRED conceiving the di&s;traction in the &s;tate favoured his return, &s;upported by a few de&s;perate partizans, again a&s;cended the throne.

His tyranny and vices were odious, and all his &s;ubjects groaned under their oppre&s;&s;ions. At length the enormity of his crimes rou&s;ed the people, who no longer could &s;upport their afflictions; cabals and in&s;urrections were di&s;|covered in every quarter of the kingdom, which at length broke out into a ge|neral rebellion; and in the tumult <HI>Ethelred</HI> was &s;lain on the 18th of April, 795, at <HI>Corbre,</HI> having reigned near four years after his re&s;toration.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="27">From this period the <HI>kingdom</HI> of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was rent by innumerable fac|tions, and an univer&s;al anarchy prevailed.

<P><HI>EGBERT</HI> King of the <HI>We&s;t Saxons,</HI> having conquered <HI>Northumber|land,</HI> became Sovereign of the united States of the <HI>Heptarchy.</HI></P>
<P>The modes of government being &s;ettled, and each province recon|ciled to his authority, he di&s;banded his army, and during &s;even years peace, promoted the cultivation of tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences, which &s;hould increa&s;e the general happine&s;s and wealth of his people.</P>
<P>In the thirty-&s;econd year of this reign, the <HI>Danes</HI> made their fir&s;t de&s;cent upon this i&s;land. To trace all the ravages tho&s;e Barbarians
<PB N="2" REF="31">
committed, would lead to de&s;criptions tedious and painful: many parts of <HI>Northumberland</HI> retain memorials of their ho&s;tilities; and &s;uch in the cour&s;e of this work will nece&s;&s;arily be attended to.</P>
<P>It appears, that under <HI>Alfred,</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> held the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but whether as tributaries or conquerors, is not clearly a&s;certained: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Alfredus po&s;tea Danis permi&s;it, quos Athel&s;tanus pauculos po&s;t annos exturbavit.</P>
<BIBL>Camden Brit.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Athel&s;tan</HI> obtained many &s;ignal victories over them, and at length effected their expul&s;ion from this territory.</P>
<P>From this period we find the government of Northumberland repo&s;ed in nominees of the Crown, who a&s;&s;umed the titles of Earls of Northum|berland; many of whom are named by our Hi&s;torians, and their pe|culiar actions, &s;o far as they are relative to the immediate objects of my attention in this work, are recounted.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Among&s;t whom the&s;e are reckoned up in order in our hi&s;tories:&mdash;O&s;ulfe, O&s;lake, Edulph, Waldeof the Elder, Uchtred, Adulph, Alred, Siward, To&s;tie, Edwin, Morcar, O&s;culph, and that right valiant Siward, as he lived in arms, &s;o would he die armed.&mdash;Then this earl|dom and the&s;e parts were given unto To&s;tie, the brother of Earl Harold: but the earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon, with other lands of his, were a&s;&s;igned to the noble Earl Waldeof his &s;on and heir. I will add what I have read in an old manu&s;cript, in the library of John Stowe, an Antiquary of the city of London:&mdash;Cop&s;o being made Earl of Northum|berland by William the Conqueror, expelled O&s;culph, who &s;oon after flew him: O&s;culph did not long &s;urvive this revenge, he being killed by a javelin, from the hands of a robber After this Go&s;patrick purcha&s;ed this earldom of the Conqueror, but was &s;oon after depo&s;ed. Waldeof the &s;on of Siward &s;ucceeded him, and he in a &s;hort time lo&s;t his head. Then Walcher Bi&s;hop of Durham had the earldom, and was &s;lain at a riotous a&s;&s;embly of the people. Ro|bert Mowbray attained the&s;e honours, which he forfeited by trea&s;onable attempts to depo&s;e King William Rufus, in favour of Stephen Earl of Albemarle. King Stephen gave this earl|dom to Henry, &s;on of David the Scotch King; and William his &s;on, afterwards King of Scotland, a&s;&s;umed the title, claiming it from his mother of the family of Earls Warren, as appears by the book of Brinkburn Abbey. After &s;ome time elap&s;ed, Richard the Fir&s;t &s;old this earldom to Hugh Pud&s;ey Bi&s;hop of Durham for life, ceriding him in his title, as having tran&s;migrated an old Bi&s;hop into a young Earl. But when the King was a pri&s;oner to the Emperor, in his return from the Holy Land, Hugh having contributed for his ran&s;om only 2000 pounds of &s;ilver, which the King re&s;enting, e&s;teeming it but a trifling &s;um for one who had ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e riches, he dive&s;ted him of this dignity: after which time the title of Earldom of Northumberland lay dormant about 180 years. At length it was revived in the family of Piercys.</Q></P>

<P>In this county innumerable monuments of antiquity and natural beau|ties exi&s;t, to excite a traveller's curio&s;ity. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Romans, and in after times the conflicts with the Saxons, Danes, and Scots,

<P><Q>This and the three following belong to the Roman &s;tation which has been at Whitley Ca&s;tle, near Kirkhaugh, in the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the county of Northumberland. It is only the old Roman &s;tation that goes by the name of the Ca&s;tle. This &s;tation is upon the military way u&s;ually called the maiden way: and this in&s;cription is in the cu&s;tody of Mr Henry Wallace of Whitley, the proprietor of the ground in which the &s;tation has been. The &s;tone is manife&s;tly of that &s;ort that are u&s;ually in&s;erted in the face of the walls or other works built or rebuilt by the &s;oldiers: and nothing more can be inferred from this in&s;cription, but that a vexillation of the 20th legion had rebuilt this &s;tation, or &s;omewhat about it.</Q></P>

<P><Q>This in&s;cription is in a hou&s;e that &s;tands ju&s;t at the &s;outh entry of the &s;tation, and is called Ca&s;tle Nook. It is a great pity it &s;hould be &s;o imperfect and broken, &s;ince probably it has been much of the &s;ame nature with that of which Camden has given us the original, and which I &s;hall next de&s;cribe. I have &s;et the reading under this in&s;cription, which I take to be right. I know not whether the character like a Greek &PHgr;, in the third line, be only an ornamental &s;top, or de&s;igned for Pio, or that the P has been effaced, and this put only for 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, accord|ing to the like contraction in the in&s;cription now in the library at Edinburgh. Nor am I able to determine, whether the fir&s;t letters in the 4th line can have been P. R. for Procon&s;ul, a title that Caracalla al&s;o a&s;&s;umed, or for Praefectus, the name of the commander having been at the end of the preceding line.</Q></P>
<BIBL>Hor&s;ley, p. 250.</BIBL></NOTE> we find two altars in&s;cribed to the Emperor Caracalla, which prove this matter. It is contended by &s;ome, that Alione was held up and garri&s;oned by the Romans to the late&s;t date of their abode in this country. This was a wretched place for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a cohort; cultivation (even in this age) has only crept down the &s;kirts of the valleys, and hung upon the margins of the rivers; even where her &s;teps have imprinted the narrow &s;hores, corn has not hitherto ble&s;&s;ed the labour of the hu&s;bandman.</P>

However, from this and Camden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s copy diligently compared, I have given &s;uch a reading to it, as appeared to me the mo&s;t probable. Camden tells us, "that the in&s;cription was imperfect, and compendiou&s;ly written, with the letters linked one in another," yet he has given it only in plain Roman capitals; but by the help of the &s;tone at Appleby. I have brought it nearer to the true form. The in&s;cription is manife&s;tly to Caracalla, and the titles given to his predece&s;&s;ors are agreeable to the Roman hi&s;tory. All that Camden &s;ays in relation to it, by way of explication, is, "that the third cohort of the Nervii built a temple here to Antoninus the Emperor, the &s;on of Severus."&mdash;But in order to make &s;ome &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the latter part of the in&s;cription, we mu&s;t con&s;ider it more nicely. In the ninth line there have been mo&s;t probably &s;ome numeral letters after IMP. and more after TR. POT, and the&s;e may be determined by con&s;ulting hi&s;tory and the in&s;criptions on coins, in order to know how oft he en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oyed the tribunitial power, and been &s;aluted Imperator, when he was the fourth time Con&s;ul, which was the &s;econd year after his father's death, and his leaving Britain I find one Roman coin, which &s;eems to determine the whole; in which we have TR. P. XVI. IMP. II. COS. IIII; &s;o that the ninth line has probably been the like, as above. 'Tis true he had often, during the &s;ame con&s;ulate, the tribunitial power, and was oftener &s;aluted Imperator, but the vacant &s;paces &s;eem not to admit any larger numbers. The P. P. at the end of the line is <HI>Patri Patriae.</HI> In the next line I apprehend there is only an X wanting before Voto, thus, AED EX VOTO, <HI>adem ex Voto,</HI> &amp;c. PR. PR. for Propraetor, &s;eems al&s;o to be effaced in the la&s;t line but one. But I am apt to think there has been nothing more in the la&s;t line, and that no letters are wanting between the M and G (though &s;o repre&s;ented in Camden as if there were) and that we are to read <HI>Genio Romae Po&s;uit.</HI> So that if this temple has been erected to Caracalla, it has been dedicated to him as the Genius of Rome, or of the Roman people, a flattering compliment too often paid by the Roman people to their Emperors. Perhaps the name of the Propraetor has been de&s;ignedly &s;truck out; but who he was cannot be known from any other in&s;criptions: and as for the Roman hi&s;torians, they are entirely &s;ilent with re&s;pect to any affairs in Britain at this time, and for a great while after. To remove the difficulty that may &s;eem to ari&s;e from Caracalla's being called the grand&s;on of M. Aurelius Antoninus, to whom his father Severus was no ways related, nor ever adopted by him, it may not be ami&s;s to repeat what I ob&s;erved before from X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">philine, "that after the death of Albinus, Severus called him&s;elf the &s;on of Marcus, and brother of Commodus: hence his &s;on Caracalla is called the grand&s;on of Marcus Antoninus. But there is another difficulty in the words of the in&s;cription, and that is, how Caracalla could be adnepos or atnepos both to Trajan and Nerva: for if he was &s;o to the former, as the regular &s;eries of the preceding Emperors requires, he mu&s;t have been trinepos to Nerva. Perhaps therefore the word et in the &s;ixth line &s;hould be fil. and we ought to read <HI>Divi Tra|jani Parthici filii divi Nervae, adnepoti.</HI> This will make the genealogy con&s;i&s;tent; and the manner of expre&s;&s;ion is not improper, and in effect the &s;ame as <HI>Trajani adnepoti, Nervae tri|nepoti.</HI>" This in&s;cription was erected in the year 213, when Caracalla was the fourth time Con&s;ul. I have de&s;cribed and explained it next to number CXII, becau&s;e I think the&s;e two are &s;omewhat of a like nature.</Q></P>

<P>the mo&s;t remarkable piece of Roman Antiquity in this country, may not be di&s;agreeable in this place, before we enter on the more populous parts of the county. It was built as a barrier again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the northern inhabitants, who were continually harra&s;&s;ing the Ro|mans, by attacking them in &s;undry places at one time, or by &s;mall bodies of ravagers, who &s;wept away the cattle and flocks of the coun|try. The Romans called it Vallum Barbaricum, Pretentatura, and Clau&s;ura. Hadrian's vallum was con&s;tructed of earth, and bears date about the year 123 of the chri&s;tian aera. Severus's is &s;uppo&s;ed by many to be of ma&s;onry, and built about the year 210;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spartian, p. 363, calls Severus's work a Stone Wall.</NOTE> but of the mate|rials it was con&s;tructed, the Roman authorities are very vague and doubtful. Bede &s;ays, <Q>Severus having been victorious at home in the civil war, which was attended with many dangers, was drawn into Britain upon an almo&s;t general revolt of the allies there; where after many conflicts, having recovered part of the i&s;land, he thought it ex|pedient to &s;ever it from the barbarous &s;tates; not with a wall, as &s;ome think, but with a rampier; for a wall is made of &s;tone, but a ram|pier, whereby camps are fortified to repel the force of an enemy, is made of turfs cut out of the earth, and rai&s;ed in the manner of a wall, &s;o that there be a ditch or trench in front whereout the turfs are gotten; upon which were pitched piles of very &s;trong timber. And &s;o Severus ca&s;t a great ditch, and rai&s;ed a mo&s;t &s;trong rampier,
<PB N="20" REF="49">
&s;trengthened with many turrets thereupon, from &s;ea to &s;ea.</Q> Here we have a perfect de&s;cription of one of the Roman fortifications, which Bede by mi&s;take attributes to Severus&mdash;an outward ditch, a rampier of earth fortified with a &s;trong pali&s;ado, and guarded by turrets; from whence, with mi&s;&s;ile weapons, the defenders could flank the vallum, and command the ditch upon an a&s;&s;ault. The third and la&s;t vallum is by many authors &s;aid to be the work of the Britons, aided by the Ro|mans, under the third con&s;ulate of Aetius, about the year 444, who upon receiving a &s;econd emba&s;&s;y, complaining of the hard&s;hips they laboured under from the frequent inroads and inva&s;ions of the nor|thern nations, and their inability to re&s;i&s;t them, a legion was &s;ent into Britain, who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the natives, built, (or rather rebuilt and rein&s;tated) the wall of &s;tone, in length 68 miles, from the point of land at Boulne&s;s, on Solway Firth, to the mouth of the Tyne. Gildas &s;ays, <Q>the Romans erected a wall after their u&s;ual manner of building, not like unto the other (meaning the vallum of earth or turf) or at the common charge of the empire, but aided by the poor and mi&s;e|rable natives; this was carried from &s;ea to &s;ea, between the cities, which were placed there as fortifications again&s;t the enemy.</Q> Bede adds, <Q>which wall, that was heretofore famous and con&s;picuous, they, with public and private co&s;t, having with them the helping hand of the Britons, built eight feet broad and twelve feet high, in a direct line from ea&s;t to we&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to wrong per&s;onages, it being allowed by the mo&s;t learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rk of Severus, which opinion is &s;ounded on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Severus was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded in the work by the Bri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pplies of nece&s;&s;aries for the artificers in the progre&s;s of it.</NOTE> Camden &s;ays, "it had many towers or fortre&s;&s;es, each about a mile di&s;tant, which are called Ca&s;tle-&s;teeds; and within, little fenced towns, in the&s;e days called Che&s;ters.

Camden &s;ays, in his time there was a traditionary tale, that a brazen trumpet ran through the wall, by which an alarm might be communicated from tower to tower. This report he reconciles by an ancient &s;ervice attendant on the border lands OF CORNAGE, for which to this day a money payment i&s;&s;ues out of many of the Northumbrian e&s;tates. This &s;ervice of Cornage was a kind of tenure in grand &s;erjeantry, the nature
<PB N="21" REF="50">
of which was to alarm the country by the &s;ound of a horn when any inva&s;ion of the Scots was perceived. The wall then was a formidable defence, 12 feet high, guarded by ca&s;tles and exploratory turrets.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Whereas the Roman Empire, by the providence of Diocle&s;ian, was in the mo&s;t di&s;tant marches &s;ecurely fortified with towns, ca&s;tles, and burghs.

Con&s;tantine aboli&s;hing this order of garri&s;on, removed his troops from the marches to cities and towns not needful of armed force: &s;o that he left the marches open to the barbarians, ungarri&s;oned, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the cities with the maintenance of troops, where there was a &s;ettled peace. The frontier &s;tations became de&s;olate, the &s;ol|diers addicted to theatrical entertainments and other plea&s;ures, became debauched. In a word, he it was who brought the fir&s;t cau&s;e of ruin to the empire.</Q></P>
<BIBL>Zo&s;imus.</BIBL></NOTE> I examined the foundations of &s;ome of tho&s;e ca&s;tle-&s;teads with attention, where the military roads approached the wall, and they appeared to me the remains of gate-ways, over which, perhaps, there were towers for their defence. No other apertures are &s;een in the wall but at the &s;ta|tions, which is &s;ingular, as the Romans, when they found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;cour the outward frontiers, or make a &s;ally on a &s;udden attack, had no &s;ally-ports, or other means to depart their own fortification than by de&s;cending the wall, or making an egre&s;s at one of the&s;e &s;tations or military ways, which indeed &s;eems &s;trangely incon&s;i&s;tent. It is very probable, that the Che&s;ters were defended in the &s;ame manner as the wall de&s;cribed by Bede, and perhaps the vallum was &s;urmounted with a pali&s;ado, of which the Corona Vallaris, I pre&s;ume, is a model not to be denied. The obtu&s;e angles of the &s;tations encourage an apprehen|&s;ion that they were guarded by exploratory turrets.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t part of the wall now &s;tanding, is near Carr-Voran, where it runs upon the brink of a cliff, to the &s;ummit of &s;ome emi|nences: it is there near nine feet high, the outward facing of free &s;tone, not totally removed. Where the foundation was not good, or the wall had to pa&s;s a mora&s;s, it is built on piles of oak: the inter&s;tice between the two facings of the wall, is filled with broad thin &s;tones, placed ob|liquely, and filled with run lime. Camden &s;ays, the wall near Carr-Voran in his time was 15 feet high, and 9 feet thick, built on both &s;ides of four-&s;quare a&s;hler &s;tones; which greatly exceeds Bede's de&s;crip|tion. At &s;ome little di&s;tance from Walwick, the remains of the turf or earth fence, are to be &s;een in three di&s;tinct bankings, or rampiers; the principal one about the height of 9 feet, and 33 feet at the ba&s;e: at the di&s;tance of 24 feet to the &s;outh, is a trench 21 feet wide, from the
<PB N="22" REF="51">
&s;outhern brink of which ari&s;es a rampier of earth, about 10 feet at its ba&s;e, and 6 feet in height: 16 feet di&s;tant from this is another rampier of equal height, and 19 feet at its ba&s;e; the&s;e two la&s;t on the &s;outh &s;ide of the trench, forming a perfect covered way, in breadth 16 feet. The mo&s;t northern of the&s;e rampiers, in this part, is di&s;tant from the &s;tone wall 30 paces; the pre&s;ent military road pa&s;&s;ing between them.</P>
<P>The particular de&s;cription of the&s;e fortifications of the Romans, given by Mr Hor&s;ley, in his Brit Rom. and Mr Warburton, in his Vallum Rom. would be too tedious to be in&s;erted here, and incon&s;i&s;tent with my plan. Their more general ob&s;ervations, together with my own, mu&s;t &s;uffice.</P>
<P>It is evident there have been three different Praetenturae erected here at different times, and by different per&s;ons: the fir&s;t of which was a &s;e|ries of &s;tations or forts, placed quite cro&s;s the country; and this, it is pre&s;umed, was done chiefly by Julius Agricola, and is the mo&s;t ancient of the three. Next to this was erected Hadrian's vallum, and its ap|purtenances; after which the afore&s;aid &s;tations might probably go by the name of <HI>Stationes</HI> per <HI>Liniam Valli.</HI> The la&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t fence of all was (as mo&s;t learned antiquaries agree) built by Severus, which is a &s;tone wall, that lays north of the rampiers of earth.</P>
<P>Hadrian's vallum was the &s;econd Praetentatura, and &s;eems rather to have given the former the name of Stations per <HI>Liniam Valli,</HI> than the wall of Severus. What Bede &s;ays of the wall's being rebuilt afterwards by the Romans, is applicable to this: <Q>that it is carried on from town to town much in a &s;trait line.</Q> What belongs to this work, is the Vallum on the brink of the ditch, having the ditch on the north, ano|ther Vallum &s;outhward, di&s;tant from the former about 16 feet, and a large Vallum on the north of the ditch. The &s;outh Vallum has either been made for an inner defence, in ca&s;e the enemy might beat them from any part of the principal vallum, or to protect the &s;oldiers again&s;t a &s;udden attack from the provincial Britons. The&s;e four works keep all the way a con&s;tant regular paralleli&s;m one to another. The third Praetentatura was Severus's &s;tone wall. We have the expre&s;s te&s;timony of &s;ome ancient writers, concerning this Emperor's building a wall cro&s;s our i&s;land; which will be explained hereafter. To this work be|longs

a paved military way, which has attended the wall on the &s;outh &s;ide, though it be not always parallel to it. It &s;ometimes coincides with Hadrian's north vallum; but whenever this is too di&s;tant, or perhaps has been too ruinous, or in any other re&s;pect inconvenient, the new mili|tary way (which is a reparation of the old Roman road made by order of government) always accompanies Severus's wall, and comes up near to every Ca&s;tellum upon it; and therefore it is to be pre&s;umed the Ro|man military road has been a work cotemporary with the wall, and directly for its &s;ervice. It is apprehended there has been al&s;o a le&s;&s;er military way near to the wall, for the convenience of &s;mall parties pa&s;&s;ing from turret to turret. There is al&s;o belonging to this work, a large ditch on the north &s;ide of the wall; but there are no remains, to prove that there was any brea&s;twork or Agger of earth on its northern brink. Upon this wall certain ca&s;tles and turrets have been regularly placed, and at proper di&s;tances one from another; and in order to form a general idea of the wall, and its original &s;tate, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to have &s;ome knowledge of the&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e ca&s;tles, except one near Harlow Hill, (which may have been built before the wall) are 66 feet &s;quare, the wall it&s;elf falling in with and forming the north &s;ide of them. The intervals between the&s;e ca&s;|tles are not always exactly the &s;ame, but excepting two or three at the ea&s;t end of the wall, always le&s;s than a mile, that is, from &s;ix furlongs and a half to &s;even. They are con&s;tantly called ca&s;tles or ca&s;tle-&s;teads by the country people, (which &s;eems to make it probable that the latin word has been ca&s;tellum) and by the form and u&s;e of them, &s;eem to have been a &s;maller &s;ort of a ca&s;tle for a &s;mall garri&s;on. So likewi&s;e they call the Ca&s;tra Stativa, or Ae&s;tiva u&s;ually Che&s;ters, from the Latin: and this is a u&s;ual criterion whereby to di&s;cover a Roman encampment or &s;tation. The&s;e Ca&s;tella &s;eem to have &s;tood clo&s;e&s;t, where the &s;tations are wide&s;t, and are by &s;ome modern authors called mile ca&s;tles, or mil|liary Ca&s;tella. In the la&s;t edition of Camden, they are, through mi&s;take, &s;aid to be of a very different &s;hape and &s;ize. Perhaps the remaining ruins of two or three ca&s;tle-&s;teads, that do not join the walls, and of one that does, which are all plainly of another &s;ort, have occa&s;ioned this error. It is not improbable, that there may al&s;o have been &s;ome exploratory ca&s;tles belonging to Hadrian's work, though there be little appearance of &s;uch at pre&s;ent, unle&s;s the &s;mall remains at Chapel Hou|&s;es, near Newburn, and tho&s;e near Heddon on the Wall, which are Ca&s;tle-Steads, be of this &s;ort. But be that as it will, (in relation to

<P><PB N="25" REF="54">The &s;mall turrets (in Latin, Turres) have been more generally and entirely ruined than the Ca&s;tella; &s;o that it is hard to find three of them any where together with certainty. The di&s;tance between two, where it was thought &s;ure&s;t, was mea&s;ured, and found to be near 14 chains, or 308 yards. It therefore &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that there have been four of the&s;e between every two Ca&s;tella, at equal di&s;tances from the Ca&s;tella and one another; for thus five intervals will be found between every two Ca&s;tella, each con&s;i&s;ting of 14 chains; which five intervals will ju&s;t amount to 7 furlongs, the u&s;ual or mean di&s;tance between the Ca&s;tella. And this &s;cheme an&s;wers with a good deal of exactne&s;s to the &s;ituation of all the turrets, that have yet been di&s;covered. The&s;e ex|ploratory turrets, or watch towers, &s;eem to have been only about four yards &s;quare at the bottom; and by placing centinels at each of the&s;e, who mu&s;t have been within call of one another, the communication quite along the wall might be kept up, without having recour&s;e to the fiction of a &s;ounding trumpet, or pipes laid under ground, from one end of the wall to the other, though this &s;eems to be credited by Mr Echard and others.</P>
<P>There have al&s;o been &s;everal larger forts or &s;tations upon the wall, or near it, who&s;e di&s;tances from each other will be particularly &s;hewn hereafter, and may be &s;een in the foregoing table.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am giving a general view of the ancient &s;tate of the wall, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that there have been 18 of the&s;e &s;ta|tions upon it, with 17 intervals between them: the wall is in length 68 miles and three furlongs; this divided by 17, gives the mean di&s;tance, which is very little more than four miles: but the &s;tations are much clo&s;er and thicker at each end, and in the middle, than in the interme|diate &s;paces, between the middle and the extremities; which is not di&s;agreeable to rea&s;on, or the u&s;ual rules of fortification. Be&s;ides, if according to the common tradition, the inroads of the enemy were in, or near the middle, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make it &s;tronger, and guard it more; e&s;pecially &s;ince the advanced &s;tations were fewe&s;t, if any, where tho&s;e upon the wall were clo&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>This wall runs generally upon the top or ridge of the higher ground, keeping a de&s;cent on the north or enemy's &s;ide, and hath thereby both a greater &s;trength, and better pro&s;pect; for the &s;ake of which, it often forms an angle. In Hadrian's vallum it is different, but both in the
<PB N="26" REF="55">
main &s;eem to have been carried on pretty much in a &s;traight line, from &s;tation to &s;tation: there is indeed now and then a gentle turn in cro&s;&s;ing a rivulet, or at a &s;tation, and &s;ometimes too in pa&s;&s;ing a height; but this la&s;t happens u&s;ually at coming within &s;ight of a &s;tation, and per|haps in order to reach it. Hadrian's vallum keeps more in a &s;traight line than Severus's wall, as much as the nature of the ground and other circum&s;tances would admit. It is plain, a military way has con&s;tantly attended Severus's wall, and no doubt was made at the &s;ame time with it: this always keeps nigh to the wall, and never coincides with the north vallum of Hadrian, but when the two works approach one another. When they part, and go at a di&s;tance one from the other, the way leaves the vallum to accompany the &s;tone wall; but where the wall pa&s;&s;es along the brink of precipices, the way does not fol|low every little turn, but in the&s;e le&s;&s;er windings, is like the &s;tring of a bow, and keeps upon the &s;ides of the hill, in order to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;udden a&s;cent or de&s;cent in pa&s;&s;ing from hill to hill, and yet &s;o as at the &s;ame time never to be at a great di&s;tance from the wall. The rule therefore by which this way &s;eems to have been conducted, is in general by keeping pretty clo&s;e to the wall, and and at the &s;ame time going on a line from Ca&s;tellum to Ca&s;tellum, and &s;hunning the a&s;cent of hills as much as po&s;&s;ible. And as the &s;maller military way went from turret to turret clo&s;e by the wall, &s;o this greater way attended the Ca&s;tella, falling in with Hadrian's north vallum (which Mr Warburton conceives was the old military way, though north of the ditch, vallums, and covered way) when that did not take too much out of the road, or was not too ruinous to be made u&s;e of. The old military way, as Mr Warburton calls it, has been the be&s;t and mo&s;t direct pa&s;&s;age from &s;tation to &s;tation, and when the line of the &s;tations fetched a compa&s;s, another di&s;tinct military way, and &s;horter, was laid; not from one &s;tation to the next, but between two &s;tations more remote.</P>
<P>This was certainly done in Northumberland, from Walwick to Carr-Voran; and I have rea&s;on to apprehend the like was done al&s;o in Cum|berland, from Carr-Voran, or at lea&s;t from Cambeck, to Stanwicks. The military way of Severus &s;eems to have been well paved, but not rai&s;ed &s;o high as what Mr Warburton calls the old military way.</P>
<P>Mr Warburton &s;ays, he was not able to di&s;cover any gates in this wall, or pa&s;&s;es through it, except ju&s;t in the &s;tations, or where the
<PB N="27" REF="56">
grand military roads have cro&s;&s;ed it: where the Ermin-&s;treet (not the Watling-&s;treet, as Mr Hor&s;ley calls it) pa&s;&s;es the wall near Halton, there is a vi&s;ible track of a &s;quare gate, and the ditch belonging to the wall manife&s;tly goes about the half of it, the inner half not being now &s;o vi&s;ible. This gate &s;eems to be much of the &s;ame &s;ize with one of the Ca&s;tella, 66 feet &s;quare; only the&s;e are wholly within the wall, and the gate half within, and half without. Mr Warburton &s;ays, he expected to have found &s;ome other gates of the &s;ame form, or &s;ome pa&s;&s;es through the wall in the Ca&s;tella, but could not. The other two military ways which cro&s;s the wall, &s;eem to have pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;tations of Carr-Voran and Stanwicks.</P>
<P>What the &s;everal dimen&s;ions of the walls, ditches, Vallums, and mi|litary ways have originally been, may not be ea&s;y to determine with exactne&s;s; but the length of Severus's wall is certainly known, it hav|ing been three times mea&s;ured of late; once by Mr Gordon, a &s;econd time by order of Mr Warburton, and a third by the Board of Ordnance, A. D. 1750; and as there is little difference between the three mea&s;ures, it is a proof there is no material mi&s;take in either. Mr Gordon gives a &s;ummary account of his work in the&s;e words: <Q>The number of &s;ta|tions taken in my actual &s;urvey from &s;ea to &s;ea, were in all 159, wherein I made Severus's wall the principal line of the &s;aid &s;tationary di&s;tances; the total amount of which was 73959 Roman paces, equal to 73 Roman miles and 959 Roman paces, equal to 68 Engli&s;h miles and 169 paces.</Q></P>
<P>The number of &s;tations (or places of ob&s;ervation) upon the &s;ame principal &s;tationary line, in the &s;urvey Mr Warburton ordered to be made, were 164; the length of the wall, 68 miles and 3 furlongs, in|cluding the length of the &s;tations at each end. In this account Engli&s;h mea&s;ured miles and furlongs are retained, in order to make it more plain and intelligible. It is ea&s;y to reduce an Engli&s;h mile to a Roman one, by con&s;idering that 1000 Roman paces, that is, 5000 Roman feet, make a Roman mile; and allowing for the inequality between the Ro|man foot and the Engli&s;h, an Engli&s;h mile is nearly equal to a Roman mile and one-thirtieth; &s;o that 13 Engli&s;h miles will be much about 14 Roman.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it appears to be a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e Ha|drian's vallum longer than Severus's wall, as Mr Gordon &s;eems to have
<PB N="28" REF="57">
done. It is certain the former has gone more in a right line than the latter, and it &s;eems probable, that Severus's wall has at each end been carried further than Hadrian's: &s;o that the very exact agreement, which Mr Gordon &s;uppo&s;es between <Q>the actual &s;urvey of the wall, and the account given of it by the Romans them&s;elves,</Q> is in a great mea&s;ure imaginary. For according to Spartian, Hadrian's vallum was 80 Ro|man miles long; but the actual men&s;uration cannot &s;tretch Severus's wall up to 73, and Hadrian's vallum is certainly two or three miles &s;horter, upon account of its being &s;traighter. There had ju&s;t been 81 milliary Ca&s;tella upon Severus's wall, and con&s;equently ju&s;t 80 intervals between the ca&s;tella. So that if the Romans, in a general way, called every interval a mile, one with another, and Hadrian's vallum was near the &s;ame length with Severus's, this might be looked upon as a plau&s;ible rea&s;on, why the hi&s;torian &s;hould &s;ay it was 80 miles long.</P>
<P>According to Bede, the wall was eight feet in breadth, and twelve feet in height (as probably there was a parapet or pali&s;ado at the top, &s;o this would fir&s;t go to ruin; Bede's mea&s;ure is mo&s;t likely to be exclu&s;ive of the&s;e): the thickne&s;s of Severus's wall has been mea&s;ured &s;everal times of late, and by &s;everal per&s;ons, without any great variation; and by the mea&s;ures taken in different parts, it &s;eems not to have been every where equal. Near Harlow-hill, it mea&s;ured &s;even feet four inches near the foundation; and at another place, where the wall is two yards high, it was at that height about &s;even feet thick; which &s;hews that the u&s;ual breadth near the foundation was a Roman pace and an half. Near Boulne&s;s on the Solway Firth, at a place called Kirklands, it mea&s;ures near nine feet: and there &s;eems to be an obvious rea&s;on why it &s;hould be &s;tronger here; for at full &s;ea, the water has certainly flowed up to it.</P>
<P>The breadth of Hadrian's ditch, at a lime-&s;tone quarry we&s;t of Harlow-hill, where the original breadth and depth is apparent, and may be ex|actly a&s;certained, it mea&s;ured near nine feet deep and eleven feet over; it was wider at the top than at the bottom, the &s;ides being &s;loping. The ditch belonging to Severus's wall, was in all places both wider and deeper than that which belonged to Hadrian's vallum.</P>
<P>The di&s;tances between the &s;everal parts of the&s;e works &s;eem, &s;ome of them, to have all the way been con&s;tantly the &s;ame; others of them vary. Among the&s;e variable di&s;tances, is that between the two walls, which &s;ometimes come very near within a chain of each other, but at
<PB N="29" REF="58">
other times are at 50 chains di&s;tance. The di&s;tance al&s;o between Se|verus's wall, and the military way belonging to it, is, as I have &s;aid, not always the &s;ame, though generally about two or three chains: upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions, it may run at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix chains from it, or con&s;iderably more, as between the two Ca&s;tella we&s;t of Shewen Sheels, where the di&s;tance of the military way from the wall, is at one part 15 chains or more; but the di&s;tance between Hadrian's Val|lum, ditch, and north mound, are every where the &s;ame, and &s;o are con&s;tantly parallel one to the other. The north mound is about 24 feet on a medium from the ditch; and of the two mounds of the Vallum, one ari&s;es on the very brink of the ditch, and the other is about the di&s;tance of 16 feet. The materials of which the&s;e fortifications were con&s;tructed, are certainly known. Hadrian's is of earth, though &s;ome|times mixed with &s;tone; but I could di&s;cover no appearance of timber. Severus's was of free &s;tone, as is certain from what is yet vi&s;ible of it: in &s;ome places, where the foundation was not good, they &s;eem to have made u&s;e of oaken piles. The inner part of this wall is filled after a remarkable manner; the filling &s;tones are generally pretty large, and mo&s;tly broad and thin. The&s;e are always &s;et edge-ways, and u&s;ually not erect, but obliquely: upon the&s;e the running mortar or cement, has been poured, and by this contrivance (together with the great &s;trength of their cement, in mo&s;t places) the whole has been bound as firm, as a rock. People are much at a lo&s;s to know, from whence the Romans had the &s;tones which they u&s;ed in building the wall in &s;everal parts, and for other occa&s;ions. In &s;ome places, particularly in Cumber|land, no free &s;tone is to be had, but from a very great di&s;tance; and in other places, where &s;ome might have been had, the Romans &s;eem not to have u&s;ed it, but &s;tone of a very different grit. This appears more particularly in the &s;tation, at the end of the wall, near Cou&s;ins Hou&s;e; where the Roman &s;tone is of a very coar&s;e grit, &s;o as to be ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from others: and both the learned authors before me, &s;ay, they were a&s;&s;ured, that there was no &s;uch &s;tone, nor any quarry of &s;uch a grit, in the neighbourhood. The devil's arrows at Boroughbridge, in York&s;hire, are yet of a coar&s;er nature, and &s;eem to be artificial &s;tone.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The compo&s;ition of the devil's arrows prove them to be artificial, pieces of brick being in|termixed with the &s;mall pebbles and granules of &s;par. They appear to have been formed in a mould, the tops of the columns being channelled as the flowing in of the liquidated compo&s;i|tion might be conceived to occa&s;ion.</NOTE> Some particular places, from whence they were furni&s;hed with &s;tone,
<PB N="30" REF="59">
may be gue&s;&s;ed at with probability. Such, for in&s;tance, are the rocks between Walwick and Carraw, through part of which Hadrian's ditch was cut: and in the late edition of Camden, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;tones were got at Hellbeck Scar, on the Gelt, and Leugh Cragg; the truth of which Mr Hor&s;ley proves in his remarks on the in&s;criptions there.</P>
<P>Some have wondered, how this work could be carried on, in the face of the enemy, &s;uppo&s;ing the wall to be the very boundary at the time it was built: but there appears no rea&s;on to entertain this opinion; for when the Romans had advanced their conque&s;ts in Scotland, beyond the Firth of Tay, they only fortified the other i&s;thmus, between Forth and Clyde, which might be 30 miles, or more, &s;outh from the utmo&s;t extent of their conque&s;t, as appears from Tacitus's account of that mat|ter: &s;o that they kept their Pretenturae, or &s;eries of fortifications, cro&s;s the country, a good way within the bounds of their conque&s;t; and pro|bably when the walls were erected here, the Romans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of part of the country beyond them, and of &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advanced &s;tations there, as may be concluded from the in&s;criptions yet extant; &s;o that this wall might probably not be built, till Severus had driven the enemy &s;o far to the north, as to render them incapable of giving any interruption to the Romans, when carrying on the work.</P>
<P>At which end they began the &s;everal Pretenturae, may be another enquiry. The Pretentura of &s;tations, was mo&s;t probably begun from the we&s;t; becau&s;e Julius Agricola fir&s;t conquered the we&s;tern parts of the northern country: and Hadrian, I believe, in erecting his vallum, began there too, as &s;eems probable from the in&s;criptions. Severus, it is likely, did &s;o too with his wall, which is much confirmed by the &s;ituation of the Ca&s;tella, that are at a regular di&s;tance, if we begin our reckoning from the we&s;t; but if we begin to reckon from the ea&s;t end of the wall, the fir&s;t Ca&s;tellum appears within le&s;s than three furlongs of the Station there.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of &s;ome ingenious per&s;ons, that both the walls, with all their appurtenances, and the Stations upon them, were the work of the &s;ame time, and the &s;ame per&s;on; and that the one is only an inte|rior Vallum or fo&s;s to the other. But that this was not the original de|&s;ign of the Vallum, though it might be &s;o u&s;ed by Severus, appears plain from the te&s;timonies of the Roman hi&s;torians; nor does this no|tion &s;uit the circum&s;tances of the work it&s;elf, as they yet appear. The
<PB N="31" REF="60">
coincidence of Severus's military way, with the north Vallum without the ditch; the exact paralleli&s;m of all the parts of Hadrian's work, and the very unequal di&s;tances, that are between the two walls them&s;elves, are convincing arguments, that the walls have been erected at different times. It is al&s;o the opinion of &s;ome, to who&s;e judgment I pay a great regard, that Severus's wall was built upon the &s;ame foundation with Hadrian's principal Vallum. This conjecture is &s;upported by plau&s;ible rea&s;ons; for if the north eminence or line has been an old military way, the &s;uppo&s;ition of a rampart, and ditch to the north of that way, would remove the difficulty of the &s;oldiers being expo&s;ed to the enemy, whil&s;t they were on their march, &s;ince then the way would have been defended on both &s;ides. Again, the &s;tations too, as well as this &s;up|po&s;ed military way, are generally (though not always) included be|tween the two walls and ditches; (or between the works of Severus and Hadrian, as they are now called) the &s;tone wall of Severus frequently falling in, within the north rampart of the &s;tation, as the turf wall of Hadrian does with the &s;outhern.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the advantageous ground is often left on the north &s;ide of Hadrian's Vallum, which in one place, near Halton Che&s;ters, is ju&s;t carried round the &s;outh &s;kirt of a tumulus, or &s;mall hill, making a &s;udden turn, &s;eemingly, with a de&s;ign to avoid pa&s;&s;ing over it. Now if this was intended to be the mo&s;t northerly fortification, and to be a fence again&s;t the northern enemies, this conduct &s;eems to offend again&s;t right rea&s;on, as well as again&s;t the rule of Vigetius, <Q>that care &s;hould be taken to have no neighbouring hill higher than the fortification; which being &s;eized by the enemy, might be of ill con&s;equence.</Q> And it mu&s;t be owned, that the &s;outhern pro&s;pect of Hadrian's work, and the defence on that &s;ide, is generally better than on the north; whereas the northern pro&s;pect and defence, have been principally or &s;olely taken care of in the wall of Severus. Such con&s;iderations as the&s;e have in+duced &s;ome to believe, that what now goes by the name of Hadrian's work, was originally de&s;igned for a fence again&s;t any &s;udden in&s;urrec|tion of the provincial Britons, and particularly of the Brigantes; whil&s;t others look upon it as a Fo&s;&s;a Interior, for the &s;oldiers to retreat to, after they had been beaten off, by the northern enemy from their principal Vallum. Both agree in this, that Hadrian mu&s;t have built a more nor|therly Vallum, than tho&s;e which now bear his name; and that this mu&s;t have &s;tood upon the &s;ame track, where Severus afterwards erected his wall. This, according to their opinion, would render the whole
<PB N="32" REF="61">
fortification rational, and regular; whereas, without this, it mu&s;t have been in many places very weak, and open to the inroads of the Cale|donians. But on the other hand, plau&s;ible conjectures and &s;peculative arguments, mu&s;t give way to &s;tronger proofs on the contrary &s;ide; though at this di&s;tance of time, we cannot &s;ee into the de&s;igns of the Romans, nor account for every particular part of their conduct in this affair. Mr Hor&s;ley conceives, that what is now called Hadrian's north Agger or Vallum, was the mo&s;t ancient military way, leading from Sta|tion to Station; and that Hadrian's work, after this, was guided and limited by it, as it keeps a con&s;tant paralleli&s;m to it. The north Agger, con&s;idered as a military way, is conducted according to the Roman art and rules, in every part of it. It is carried on, in the &s;horte&s;t line, from Station to Station; and this, without doubt, is the true rea&s;on why it runs &s;o much upon the &s;outhern &s;kirts of the northern hills, the &s;horte&s;t line leading that way. This is particularly remarkable, in the &s;mall hill near Halton Che&s;ters, before ob&s;erved. The direct line of the way would have lead over the hill; but to avoid climbing it, a &s;mall turn is made to carry it round the &s;kirt; and it pa&s;&s;es on the &s;outh &s;ide ra|ther than the north; becau&s;e, this is the &s;horter and more convenient way to the Station, to which it is tending. The other parts of Hadrian's work, keep their due di&s;tance and paralleli&s;m, bending exactly in the &s;ame manner, as the north Agger or Vallum does, and &s;o running at a few yards di&s;tance to the &s;outh of the hill. In a word, the north Val|lum, or as Mr Hor&s;ley terms it, the old military way, keeps ju&s;t &s;uch a cour&s;e, and runs through &s;uch grounds, as one would expect &s;uch a Roman way &s;hould do. And if it was determined, that Hadrian's work &s;hould &s;trictly accompany this, and keep all along an exact pa|ralleli&s;m to it, they mu&s;t then by this rule, be tied down to the&s;e &s;eem|ing irregularities and mi&s;conduct, which appear in this work. It may be &s;aid, that they might at lea&s;t have made the fortification on the north &s;ide of the military way, if there was no other more northerly fence; but to this it is replied, that it was &s;carce practicable to carry on the work on the north &s;ide of the way, &s;o as to be near and parallel to it; and &s;uch is the &s;ituation of the ground, that if they had done &s;o, it would have been generally weaker than it is, running along the very &s;ides of the hills; unle&s;s they had made it where Severus's wall &s;tands, and where, as has been &s;aid, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e Hadrian's principal Vallum to have &s;tood; but that in fact Hadrian had no Vallum here, and that the whole of his work was comprehended, in what &s;till goes by his name, appears mo&s;t probable from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="62">Among all the hi&s;torians that mention the building of &s;uch a wall by Severus, there is not the lea&s;t hint to be met with, of his building it upon the &s;ame foundation with Hadrian's Vallum. The expre&s;&s;ion of Spartian, "apud Vallum," looks the like&s;t it of any; but it is cer|tainly more agreeable to this expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;uppo&s;e it to be only near the Vallum, and not directly upon it: and to build a &s;tone wall upon the foundation of an earth one, does not appear very probable. If I am not greatly mi&s;taken, it would be more laborious and expen&s;ive to build &s;uch a wall upon the ruinous Vallum, than to erect it upon ground that was entirely clear; and there is not at pre&s;ent the lea&s;t evidence of &s;uch a Vallum; yet it &s;eems hard to &s;uppo&s;e, that the mound of earth has been every where &s;o entirely removed, as to leave no vi&s;ible remains of it, any where, along the whole tract of the wall. Again, Se|verus's wall pa&s;&s;es over large &s;paces, where the erecting of an earthen rampart &s;eems almo&s;t impracticable: in &s;ome places it pa&s;&s;es, for a con|&s;iderable way, along the tops of precipices, and &s;ometimes, down the &s;teep declivities of a bare rock; and in the&s;e places there is no ditch. In one place too, the wall is carried through a &s;mall mora&s;s, near Blea|tarn, in Cumberland. Here, it is pre&s;umed, the foundation is formed by piles of wood; but Hadrian's work &s;huns it, and runs at ten chains di&s;tance from the wall of Severus. No circum&s;tances appear in the two works of Severus's wall and Hadrian's Vallum, that argue them to be done at the &s;ame time, or to have any nece&s;&s;ary relation one to the other. The con&s;tant paralleli&s;m of the north Vallum, the ditch, and the two &s;outhern Vallums of Hadrian's work, is a &s;hrewd argument of their mutual relation: but this paralleli&s;m does not hold in the wall of Severus. Where they are mo&s;t di&s;tant, there are no vi&s;ible branches of any military way leading from one to the other, whereby the com|munication between them might be more ea&s;ily pre&s;erved. In &s;ome places there is a mora&s;s between the two walls, which mu&s;t make a retreat from one wall to the other inconvenient, and is improper for a body of men to &s;tand on. The military way that now attends Severus's wall, is agreed to have been made at the &s;ame time with the wall it&s;elf: if then Hadrian's principal Vallum was on the &s;ame ground, where the wall of Severus has &s;tood; how comes it to pa&s;s, that there has been no military way accompanying it? If Hadrian's work is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been de&s;igned for a defence again&s;t an attack from the &s;outh, dif|ficulties of the &s;ame kind will ari&s;e, perhaps not ea&s;y to be removed; for &s;ometimes the advantageous ground is left on the &s;outh, where it might ea&s;ily have been otherwi&s;e ordered, if their de&s;ign had been only
<PB N="34" REF="63">
to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t a&s;&s;ailants from the &s;outh, and the cour&s;e of their fortification had not been previou&s;ly determined by &s;ome other rule. In one place the Vallum runs between higher ground on each &s;ide. Be&s;ides, if it was de&s;igned again&s;t an enemy from the &s;outh, the ditch is on the wrong &s;ide, being to the north of two ramparts: and why may we not &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;outherly rampart to have been, either a &s;light fence again&s;t an attack from the &s;outh, or an interior defence to retreat to, if the ditch &s;hould be carried by an a&s;&s;ault from the north? There was no occa&s;ion to draw &s;uch a line of defence, in order to pre|vent their making an attack upon the Stations, for they are &s;tronger on all &s;ides than this Vallum. It is to be ob&s;erved, that at each end of the wall, Severus's work is continued beyond Hadrian's. This part then of Severus's wall at lea&s;t, was not erected upon Hadrian's Vallum; and yet Mr Hor&s;ley &s;ays he &s;ee no difference between the appearance of this work here, and in the other parts of it.</P>
<P>The legionary &s;oldiers were the per&s;ons employed in building this wall, as they were generally in all con&s;iderable works of this nature; and that the three Legions, which were at that time in Britain, built Antoninus's wall in Scotland, is clear from a great number of in&s;crip|tions found in that wall, which expre&s;sly declare it. The 20th Legion had no concern in building the wall of Severus; it was wholly done by the other two; namely, the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta,</HI> and <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix;</HI> for the&s;e Legions only (as far as appears) erected the in&s;criptions, which will be given in the cour&s;e of this work. If therefore 20 Cohorts, the number in two Legions, built the whole wall, it will be ea&s;y to deter|mine the &s;hare which belonged to each Cohort: for there being 81 Ca&s;|tella upon the whole wall, and &s;o 80 milliary intervals; ju&s;t four of the&s;e intervals would fall to the &s;hare of every cohort. It may not be ami&s;s to try, how far we can find out the &s;everal Cohorts, belonging to the re&s;pective Legions, and on what part of the wall each Legion and Cohort &s;eems to have been employed.</P>
<P>If we divide the wall into four equal parts, the 1&s;t and 3d quarters reckoning from the ea&s;t, &s;eem to have been built by the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta,</HI> and the 2d, and la&s;t, by the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix;</HI> for at the ea&s;t end of the wall, we have expre&s;s mention of the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta,</HI> in the &s;tone at Denton, which is about &s;ix miles from the end of it; and we have &s;ix, if not &s;even Cohorts of this Legion, mentioned in tho&s;e centurial &s;tones found in this quarter, <HI>viz.</HI> I, II, III, V, VIII, IX; be&s;ides there
<PB N="35" REF="64">
is a &s;eeming appearance of the 6th at Wallbottle. This quarter reaches near to Halton Sheels, or to the next Ca&s;tellum ea&s;t of it; which is above two miles ea&s;t of Halton Che&s;ters. In the &s;econd quarter, which reaches from hence, to the &s;econd Ca&s;tellum we&s;t of the Hou&s;e-&s;teeds, we have the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix,</HI> on a centurial &s;tone, about four or five miles from the beginning of this quarter; and at Hou&s;e-&s;teeds and Little Che&s;ters, ju&s;t at the end of it, the &s;ame legion is mentioned upon two altars and two bricks: but the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta</HI> does not occur in this &s;pace, at lea&s;t not on any &s;tone that can be relied on. There are no Cohorts upon any &s;tones in this place, di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible, except the 6th and 10th; but no doubt &s;everal others have been mentioned upon the many &s;tones found here, though the numbers are now quite effaced. In the third quarter, which reaches to Old Wall, near Watch Cro&s;s, in the county of Cumberland, we have <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta</HI> mentioned again &s;everal times. Indeed the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix</HI> occurs upon a &s;tone in Cambeck fort, but probably it has been in&s;erted in the face of that fort, when it was repaired upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion. The Cohorts of this &s;pace, are the 1&s;t, 6th, 7th, and 9th, which I believe have all be|longed to the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta.</HI> In the la&s;t quarter, which I believe was built by the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix,</HI> I meet with no centurial &s;tones, except one at Draw-dikes, which &s;eems to have belonged to a cohort of another kind. The <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix</HI> is upon fine &s;tone at Carli&s;le, but no particular Cohorts appear in this &s;pace.</P>
<P>Julius Cae&s;ar, when he made his fir&s;t de&s;cent upon Britain, brought over only two Legions with him, which were the 7th and 10th. This latter was his favourite legion, and both together made but an army of 12,000 foot at the mo&s;t. The hor&s;e belonging to the&s;e legions never reached this i&s;land, and the foot the &s;ame year were tran&s;ported back again to Gaul.</P>
<P>The next year, when Cae&s;ar made his &s;econd de&s;cent, he brought over five Legions with him, and 2000 hor&s;e, which &s;eem to be all the hor&s;e that belonged to the&s;e Legions. There is nothing in the hi&s;tory whereby it can be known, what Legions the&s;e were, except the 7th, which is mentioned by Cae&s;ar. The&s;e likewi&s;e returned back again to Gaul, the &s;ame year in which they came over, as the two Legions had done the year before.</P>
<P>During the three &s;ucceeding reigns of Augu&s;tus, Tiberius, and Cali|gula, it is plain the Romans had no footing in Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="65">Under Claudius (who applied him&s;elf in good earne&s;t to the reduction of Britain) a con&s;iderable army was &s;ent to this i&s;land; the Emperor him&s;elf afterwards coming over in per&s;on. This army con&s;i&s;ted of Ro|man Legions and other Auxiliaries, though the hi&s;torians have not told us expre&s;sly what they were, either as to their number or names: but con&s;idering the &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s of Julius Cae&s;ar before, and the much greater conque&s;ts this army made, it is highly rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;uperior in number to the greater of Cae&s;ar's, which con&s;i&s;ted (if the Legions were compleat) of above 30,000 men. It is pre&s;umed, that the army &s;ent over by Claudius con&s;i&s;ted of four Legions, with their proper auxilia, and the u&s;ual number of hor&s;e belonging both to one and the other; and this army &s;o compo&s;ed would amount to more than 50,000 men. Any conjecture, as to the number or names of the auxi|liary Cohorts, mu&s;t be uncertain and doubtful: but both the number and names of the Legions may be certainly collected from &s;ome inci|dental pa&s;&s;ages of Tacitus. They were the &s;econd, called Augu&s;ta, the 9th, 14th, and the 20th, u&s;ually called Valens Victrix; each of which are mentioned in the in&s;criptions in&s;erted in this work.</P>
<P>As we have no evidence from hi&s;tory, that any new Legions were tran&s;ported by Nero, but that the &s;ame continued, which had been &s;ent over at fir&s;t by Claudius; &s;o it is plain, from the relation of the battle with Queen Boadicea, that the four Legions la&s;t mentioned were here under Nero, in who&s;e reign this battle happened: for according to Ta|citus's account of this matter, the 9th Legion was &s;urprized and de|&s;troyed by this Queen. The 14th, and the Vexillarii of the 20th, were in the battle, and the &s;econd, though in Britain, was ab&s;ent from the fight, through the fault of <HI>Poenius Po&s;thumus,</HI> their Commander, who fell upon his own &s;word, when he heard of the glory the troops had acquired in that engagement.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e four Legions, one continued very late, and another to the la&s;t. The Legio XX. VV. though it continued very long here, yet it &s;eems to have been recalled before the Romans had entirely abandoned the i&s;land; for it is not mentioned in the Notitia. The <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta</HI> is mentioned there, and &s;o &s;eems to have continued here to the la&s;t, and to have been the only one that was kept here during the whole time: for though the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix</HI> did al&s;o continue to the la&s;t, yet this came not over till the reign of the Emperor Hadrian. The ninth
<PB N="37" REF="66">
Legion &s;eems to have dwindled away entirely, or el&s;e the &s;mall remains of it were incorporated with the Legion &s;ent over by Hadrian.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the Legions which continued long in Britain, &s;eem for the mo&s;t part to have been jointly employed in carrying on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable works or wars that have been in this i&s;land. Thus they were jointly engaged in building the wall in Scotland, and mo&s;t or all of them, in erecting tho&s;e in the north of England: and the Le|gions and legionary Cohorts &s;eem to have been the only &s;oldiers who were employed u&s;ually in erecting forts or rai&s;ing fences. Auxiliary Cohorts appear by in&s;criptions to have been concerned in &s;ome other buildings; but forts and fences &s;eem to have been the province of the Legionaries, agreeable to that pa&s;&s;age in Tacitus, <Q>the Praefectus Ca&s;tro|rum, and legionary Cohorts, who had been left among the Silures for erecting fortifications.</Q> Thus among all the in&s;criptions found upon the Roman wall in Scotland, there is but one that mentions any aux|iliary Cohort as having a hand in the work, but always either a Legion or a Vexillation of a Legion. And I take it for granted, that all the centurial in&s;criptions upon the face of the wall in the north of England, and which probably were in&s;erted there at the time of building it, re|&s;pect only the Legions and legionary Cohorts, and yet the Stations upon the wall, as well as mo&s;t of them el&s;ewhere, were garri&s;oned by the Auxiliaries. The <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta</HI> came into Britain in the reign of Claudius, under the command of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and continued in it as long as the Romans had the lea&s;t footing here. In Hadrian's time this Le|gion was in Cumberland, at Netherby and Beau-ca&s;tle, and in the we&s;tern &s;ide of Northumberland, and &s;o probably had their &s;hare in the work of Hadrian's Vallum; or when in the advanced Stations of Ne|therby and Beau-ca&s;tle, they might be po&s;ted there to &s;ecure tho&s;e who were employed in that work. In the beginning of the reign of Anto|ninus Pius, they were mo&s;t probably upon the ea&s;tern part of the Roman wall in Northumberland. In Severus's time, it is very probable, they were employed upon the wall that goes by his name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix</HI> is u&s;ually thus expre&s;&s;ed, LEG. VI. V. to which is often added, P. F. that is, Pia fidelis; for that it is to be read &s;o rather than Pia felix. It is certain, from a great number of in&s;crip|tions and other te&s;timonies, that this Legion was a long time in Britain; and it is equally certain, that it came not over &s;o &s;oon as the others. The account of this Legion whil&s;t in Britain, mu&s;t be taken chiefly from
<PB N="38" REF="67">
&s;uch hints as ancient in&s;criptions afford us. I do not find it is men|tioned in any in&s;cription belonging to the &s;outhern parts of this i&s;land. It is probable that they made no &s;top in the &s;outh, but marched directly by the u&s;ual rout to the we&s;t end of the Vallum, and had their &s;hare in rai&s;ing that work. We have &s;everal in&s;criptions on the wall, and near it, in Northumberland and Cumberland, wherein this Legion is mentioned; as at Stanwicks, Cambeck fort, Burdo&s;wald, Little Che&s;ters, Hou&s;e-&s;teeds, and other places; &s;ome of which, from the character and other circum&s;tances, may be &s;uppo&s;ed as ancient as Hadrian's reign; the mo&s;t of them do certainly belong to the time of Severus. In the former part of the reign of Antoninus Pius, they were in Scotland, and had their &s;hare in building the wall there. Probably they marched along our Watling-&s;treet in the north, either to Scotland or from it, or both; and in their march the &s;epulchral in&s;cription might be erected for a &s;ol|dier of this Legion which was found near Riche&s;ter, in Northumberland. Whether this Legion had taken up its &s;tated quarters at York, before the reign of Antoninus Pius, and continued there between the time of building the Vallum and their march into Scotland, I cannot certainly determine: however, after their return from Scotland, and about the middle of Antoninus Pius's reign, they were &s;ettled at York; for Pto|lemy places them there: and there, I believe, they &s;tatedly quartered, till the very la&s;t, though they marched at a di&s;tance from this place, upon &s;pecial occa&s;ions. Thus, for in&s;tance, this Legion was certainly em|ployed upon the &s;tone wall of Severus, as appears, from &s;everal of the centurial in&s;criptions found on that wall, which bear the name of this Legion: perhaps &s;everal of its Cohorts might be di&s;per&s;ed into &s;ome neighbouring Stations, though York was &s;till the place of its &s;tated quar|ters. Thus, according to Mr Gale's conjecture, by the <HI>Legio Gordiana,</HI> in the in&s;criptions at Lanche&s;ter, in the county of Durham, we are to under&s;tand the <HI>Legio Sexta Victrix.</HI> The fir&s;t Cohort of this Legion mu&s;t then, in all probability, have been detached at that time from the Legion at York, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in building the works mentioned in the&s;e in&s;criptions. This was in the reign of Gordian, and &s;o after this Legion was &s;ettled at York.</P>
<P>The Legion called Valeria, or Valeriana, according to &s;ome, or Valens Victrix, according to mo&s;t, is another of the&s;e Legions, which were at the fir&s;t &s;ent over into Britain by Claudius. In the Roman in&s;criptions it is thus expre&s;&s;ed, LEG. XX. VV. but Critics and Antiquaries are not well agreed in reading the former V; &s;ome will have it to &s;tand for Valens,
<PB N="39" REF="68">
and others for Valeria or Valeriana. The motions and employments of this Legion, &s;eem to have been much the &s;ame with the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta.</HI> It is probable they were jointly concerned in erecting Ha|drian's Vallum, though we have no in&s;criptions to prove it. That this Legion was employed in building the Roman wall in Scotland, under Antoninus Pius, is clear from &s;everal in&s;criptions found on the wall, mentioning this Legion or their Vexillatio, and the quantity of the wall which they built. If the altar found at Benwell fort was erected by a Centurion of this Legion, at the &s;ame time as the other was, by a Centu|rion of the <HI>Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta,</HI> this legion mu&s;t probably have been thereabout in the former part of Antoninus Pius's reign, either doing &s;omewhat upon Hadrian's Vallum, or in their march again&s;t the Cale|donians.</P>
<P>One would expect, that this Legion bore its part in building Seve|rus's wall; but among all the centurial in&s;criptions upon the face of this wall, there is not one of this Legion, or of any Cohort &s;aid to be|long to it: and yet it appears by an in&s;cription, that this Legion was employed in &s;ome work at the Station at Whitley Ca&s;tle, the ancient Alone or Alione.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the fifth century, about the year 402, Theodo&s;ius the Second, when but two years old, was made Emperor, and joined to Arcadius, and Honorius. This Theodo&s;ius reigned half a century; and it is evident, that in his reign the Romans quite abandoned this i&s;land. It mu&s;t have been much about this time tho&s;e u&s;urpers &s;tarted up in Britain. Echard &s;ays, <Q>the inhabitants and troops that were quartered in Britain, fearing lea&s;t the Vandals &s;hould pa&s;s over the &s;ea, and &s;ubdue them with the re&s;t, revolted from their obedience to Honorius, and &s;et up one Mark, whom they declared Emperor: but they &s;oon deprived him of his life and dignity, and placed Gratian in his room, who was a countryman of their own. Within four months they murdered him too, and conferred the &s;overeignty upon one Con&s;tantine, not &s;o much in re&s;pect to his courage or quality, for he was a very incon&s;iderable man in the army; but in regard to his name, which they looked on as fortunate; hoping he would do as much as Con&s;tantine the Great had done, who was of the &s;ame name, and had been advanced to the imperial dignity in the &s;ame i&s;land. This new prince, immediately after his promotion, pa&s;&s;ed over into Gaul, and taking with him the very flower of the Briti&s;h

youth, &s;o utterly exhau&s;ted the military force of the i&s;land, that it was wholly broken, and the i&s;land left naked to new invaders.</Q></P>
<P>Britain being thus drained and exhau&s;ted both of the Roman &s;oldiers and its own youth, was, according to Gildas, and Bede after him, much harra&s;&s;ed by the Picts and Scots, and other invaders; upon which they applied to the Romans for help, who &s;ent a Legion to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. But the la&s;t certain account of the Romans' footing in Britain, I believe, is in the Notitia, if it hold true, that this part of it which re|lates to Britain, was wrote before the middle of the fifth century, or under the reign of Theodo&s;ius the Second, at which time the Roman force was much abated, though their &s;oldiers were not yet finally with|drawn from Britain; for be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of auxiliary forces, there were yet two Legions at lea&s;t remaining in this i&s;land; and the Romans &s;eem &s;till to have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that part of the i&s;land which lays to the South of Severus's wall, though of no part beyond it. The Stations upon the wall were well garri&s;oned at that time; but ex|cepting the Kenti&s;h coa&s;t, and the northern frontiers, the garri&s;ons in the other parts of Britain were very thin, and widely di&s;per&s;ed, and the re&s;t of England was entirely naked. On the other hand, it is certain (to u&s;e Echard's words) that under the reign of Valentinian the Third, <Q>Africk, Spain, Great Britain, and almo&s;t all Gaul, Germany, and Illyricum, were di&s;membered from the we&s;tern Empire.</Q> Now Valen|tinian the Third began to reign with Theodo&s;ius about the year 425, and died in 455; &s;o that we may &s;afely affirm, that in the beginning of the fifth century, the Roman Power was become low in Britain; and near the middle of that century, the Romans had entirely quitted the i&s;land.</P>
<P>I have dwelt long on this &s;ubject; Mr Warburton in his preface &s;ays, <Q>All antiquaries that I have conver&s;ed with, who have made the ac|cu&s;tomed tour of Europe, allow the Picts Wall to be the mo&s;t &s;uperb remains of Roman grandeur, that is now to be &s;een on this &s;ide the Alps." And he adds, "The venerable remains of Mona&s;teries and Ca&s;tles, with other Monuments of Antiquity, are not to be equalled in any nation or country what&s;oever.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I acknowledge the receipt of another mo&s;t agreeable letter from you, which came la&s;t night, and return you my hearty thanks for it. I am &s;orry that you, who have &s;o many af|fairs upon your hands, &s;hould give your&s;elf the lea&s;t concern to make a &s;peedy return to mine: I only beg leave to communicate to you any thing that occurs, and that you would at any time honour me with a line or two at your convenience and lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add with relation to the <HI>antiquated Cup,</HI> unle&s;s it be to beg leave to a&s;k, whether the &s;ize, &s;hape, and loo&s;e bottom, if any at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The bottom, which had been of thinner metal than the re&s;t, was con|&s;umed and worn out by time and ru&s;t.</P>
<BIBL>R. G.</BIBL></NOTE> favour its being a common <HI>Patera?</HI> If it be admitted a <HI>Pa|tera,</HI> I de&s;pair of &s;eeing any conjecture more plau&s;ible and ingenious than your own.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent you inclo&s;ed a ha&s;ty &s;ketch of my &s;cheme concerning <HI>the Stations ad Lineam Valli,</HI> that you may better under&s;tand what I have &s;aid with re&s;pect to the places mentioned on this &s;cale; your great candour will excu&s;e any marks of ha&s;te and inadvertence. I take the &s;tations rigorou&s;ly upon the line of the wall, to end with <HI>Tunocellum,</HI> and other five to have been a kind of &s;econdary &s;eries proceeding regularly from ea&s;t to we&s;t, viz. <HI>Glanoventa</HI> (Lanche&s;ter) <HI>Alone</HI> (Whitley Ca&s;tle confirmed by an old in&s;cription) <HI>Brementuracum</HI> (Bramp|ton if not Old Perith) <HI>Olenacum</HI> (Old Carli&s;le) and <HI>Viro&s;idum</HI> (Elenborough); or if we &s;up|po&s;e a tran&s;po&s;ition of the two la&s;t places, then <HI>Viro&s;idum</HI> may be Old Carli&s;le upon the river <HI>Wiza,</HI> and <HI>Olenacum,</HI> Elenborough upon the river <HI>Elen.</HI></P>
<P>I hope to get all the &s;tones that have been di&s;covered at <HI>Rieche&s;ter</HI> into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and then I &s;hall re-examine them all, with the greate&s;t care and attention I can, and if I di&s;cover any thing more, I &s;hall be &s;ure to acquaint you with it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be right with re&s;pect to the <HI>Vardii,</HI> and therefore I thank you again for having been my Apollo.</P>
<P>The altar with the in&s;cription DEAE SYRIAE is yet at <HI>Connington,</HI> but the latter part of the in&s;cription, together with the upper &s;tratum of the &s;tone, is quite gone. I gue&s;&s;ed it might be <HI>Gallorum,</HI> but <HI>Vardiorum</HI> will &s;uit the vacant interval better, if that can be relied on as exactly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="71">My repre&s;entation of the in&s;cription at <HI>Lanche&s;ter,</HI> was not in my la&s;t &s;o ju&s;t as it ought to be.</P>
<Q>VARDIOR / &mdash;REQ</Q>
<P>I cannot find the copy, though I have &s;ought for it, and therefore may not be exact in the po&s;ition of the letters, but the upper line which goes before in the in&s;cription, is upon one piece of an <HI>altar,</HI> and the lower line with the following part on another piece, that was lying &s;e|parate from the other: when I put them together, they tallied with &s;o much &s;eeming exact|ne&s;s, that I concluded they had made one and the &s;ame <HI>altar;</HI> but if we &s;uppo&s;e them to have been fragments of two different <HI>altars,</HI> the difficulty you mention will entirely vani&s;h.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your account of the <HI>Military Ways:</HI> if I can make any im|provements upon it, I &s;hall pre&s;ume to communicate them to you.</P>
<P><HI>Salmon</HI> I have, but found it was not &s;afe to follow or tru&s;t him too far.</P>
<P>I think it was in the <HI>Monthly Atlas,</HI> that I read of a Roman in&s;cription at <HI>St John's chapel at Shatte&s;bury,</HI> in the wall; but though I u&s;e that author, as having made a collection or ab&s;tract of &s;ome principal matters, yet he has no great authority or e&s;teem with.</P>

floor of one of the apartments was lately cleared, and di&s;covered to be of &s;ingular con&s;truction; con&s;i&s;ting of three tiers of flags, laid upon &s;tratas of &s;and. Some of the walls are nine feet thick: the ca&s;ing in many places has been taken away, to erect the adjoining tenements. The builder has even been afraid of the light, for the apertures are no larger than tho&s;e in the &s;tair-ca&s;es of ancient ca&s;tles. The whole carries the appearance of a horrid gloomy dungeon, where its ancient tyrants dealt in deeds of darkne&s;s.

<P>Under the &s;outh front of this ca&s;tle the Roman wall cro&s;&s;es the Tip|pal, and &s;tretches up the oppo&s;ite eminences. The name of Thirlwall, by &s;ome authors, has been derived from tho&s;e breaches made in the wall by the Scots, in their incur&s;ions.</P>
<P>Spelman's calculation of the Roman forces &s;tationed on the wall, makes them amount to the number 13,800, allowing 600 to a cohort; exclu&s;ive of a whole legion, and 13 detachments of hor&s;e and foot, on other &s;tations, and attendants on the Emperor. Con&s;tantine created an officer &s;tiled "Comes Spectabilis Litoris Saxonici," who commanded &s;even companies of foot, two troops of hor&s;e, the &s;econd legion, and a cohort to guard the coa&s;ts. In the reign of Nero, &s;ome authors alledge, the Roman army in Britain con&s;i&s;ted of 70,000.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ph. Tran&s;. No. 337.</NOTE></P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing down the road below Thirlwall Ca&s;tle, we perceived a large &s;tone lay in the way, which bore marks of the &s;culptor.

<HEAD>GREAT CHESTERS</HEAD>
<P>is little more than a mile: the Vallum of this &s;tation is very di&s;tin|gui&s;hable, of an oblong &s;quare, near the dimen&s;ions of Carr-Voran; the interior parts rugged, from the ruins of many buildings. In the cour&s;e of the Notitia, this &s;tation is called Ae&s;ica. It was garri&s;oned by the Cohors Prima A&s;torum, but no in&s;criptions have been found here, that mention this or any other cohort.</P>
<P>Great Che&s;ters mu&s;t be reckoned, Mr Hor&s;ley &s;ays, among the forts that have been well pre&s;erved: the ramparts about it are very vi&s;ible; &s;ome part of the original &s;tone wall is &s;tanding a good height; the ditch is al&s;o to be &s;een on all &s;ides, but towards the ea&s;t, where it is &s;omewhat flat. On the we&s;t &s;ide there is a double Agger and ditch. The ruins of the rampart on this &s;ide are very high: &s;everal regular cour&s;es of &s;tones are to be &s;een in this &s;ide of the rampart, where the ruins have been cleared out. The Praetorium is very vi&s;ible, being about 50 yards from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and 40 from north to &s;outh. To this is joined another parallelogram at the ea&s;t end, of the &s;ame breadth with the Praetorium, and 26 yards from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This I take to have been the Que&s;torum. On the north &s;ide of the Praetorium are large ruins of &s;ome con&s;iderable building, which probably was a temple. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the fort has been a regular entry. Part of the jambs and &s;ome other &s;tones are remaining entire; which may &s;hew for what purpo&s;e &s;uch &s;tones mu&s;t have been, which are found in other
<PB N="45" REF="75">
Roman forts. Some pieces of an iron gate and hinges have been found in the ruins not long ago. From this gate there goes a paved military way to Hadrian's Vallum, which is di&s;tant about 15 chains, which way is al&s;o continued till it joins the other military way. The out-buildings are mo&s;t con&s;iderable on the &s;outh &s;ide, though there are al&s;o &s;ome on the ea&s;t. There are va&s;t ruins of buildings in this field, which, as u&s;ual, has a gentle de&s;cent, and is open to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between this &s;tation and Little Che&s;ters, the next in my rout, is about three miles and three quarters; and here again all the Ca&s;tella are vi&s;ible, being four in number, be&s;ides one more which &s;eems to have fallen in with the &s;tation at Great Che&s;ters. The interval here again between the Ca&s;tella is &s;even furlongs.</P>
<P>A little to the we&s;t of Great Che&s;ters, near a hou&s;e called Cockmount Hill, the Picts wall begins again to a&s;cend the rocks. From Great Che&s;ters to this place the ditch is but faint, except for two or three chains, where it is di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>A little to the we&s;t of Walltown, and between that and Carr-Voran, there is a part of the wall which is in the greate&s;t perfection of any now remaining in the whole track: it is about three yards high, as I before ob&s;erved, has about 14 regular cour&s;es, and at one part 16, of the facing &s;tones entire.</P>
<P>As for Hadrian's Vallum, it is vi&s;ible all the way till it comes near Carr-Voran. It pa&s;&s;es near Low Town, ju&s;t on the &s;outh of it; and particularly the vallum or rampart on the &s;outh brink of the ditch, is here very vi&s;ible. Mr Hor&s;ley &s;ays he was informed there were the ruins of &s;ome Roman works at Low Town, but upon viewing them, nothing like it appeared. They look (he &s;ays) &s;omewhat like the hou&s;es of Mo&s;s Troopers, which &s;eems confirmed by what Camden &s;ays, <Q>that he dur&s;t venture no further this way for fear of them.</Q> He mentions Carr-Voran on the one &s;ide, and Carraw on the other; &s;o that the two Che&s;|ters and the Hou&s;e-&s;teads mu&s;t have been the &s;tations that he was afraid to vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between Great Che&s;ters and Carr-Voran is almo&s;t two miles and a quarter. In this &s;pace there are three Ca&s;tella, and all of them vi&s;ible.</P>

<P><Q>Not far from Great Che&s;ters, near a wicket or hatch at Cockmount Hill, lies a curious &s;culpture expo&s;ed to all the injuries of the weather, by which and barbarous hands, it has &s;uffered too much already. Mr Gordon was the fir&s;t, I believe, who di&s;covered or took any notice of it; but his draught has &s;everal defects in it, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is the omi&s;&s;ion of the two eagles, on who&s;e wings the victories &s;tand that &s;upport the vexillum: each eagle re&s;ts upon the branch of a tree; and the boar on the right plainly appears to take hold of the &s;tock of the tree on that &s;ide, as if he endeavoured to tear it up: the other boar at|tacks the vexillum, and lays hold of the tree, on which the other eagle is perched, with both his feet. I think there can be no doubt but the boars and trees were de&s;igned to repre|&s;ent this wild and woody country, as it then was; and the Roman en&s;igns often &s;ignify a Roman &s;ettlement: this &s;culpture therefore plainly denotes the Roman conque&s;t of this coun|try, their victories over the inhabitants, and their making a &s;ettlement here, in oppo&s;ition to all the attempts of their enemies.

Their urns were of gold, &s;ilver, and other metal, of gla&s;s, &s;tone, and marble, but mo&s;t generally of potters earth. Trajan's was of gold.

<P>Urn burial is not &s;o ancient as the pre&s;ent mode of interment: burning the dead is fir&s;t attributed to the Greeks, and Herculus is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t of the Greeks who u&s;ed it. This he did to free him&s;elf from the obligation of an oath. He had &s;worn to bring back a youth to his father from the &s;iege of Troy, and he had no way of doing it but by pre&s;enting him with his a&s;hes. From the Greeks this cu&s;tom pa&s;&s;ed to the Romans, but it was not general among them. From the authority of Pliny it appears, that it was not u&s;ed in many families, and that Sylla the Dictator was the fir&s;t of the Cornelii who&s;e body was burnt; which is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by Antiquaries, why we find Roman bones both burnt and unburnt. It was the choice of &s;ome, becau&s;e they would pre&s;erve their bodies from the re&s;entment of their enemies. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s probably was Sylla's motive. It is &s;uppo&s;ed the Gauls had it from the Ro|mans, the Celtics or ancient Brito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s from the Gauls; but it is not &s;o ea&s;ily accounted for how the Danes, and other nations called Juli and Angli, Saxons and Germans came by it. It is believed they had it from the Graecian cu&s;toms and learning, and that they all laid it a&s;ide on the introduction of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="81">To di&s;tingui&s;h which are Roman, Dani&s;h, or Briti&s;h Tumuli, has been ob&s;erved to be diffi|cult.

<P>Little Che&s;ters was the Vindolana of the Romans, where the Legio Sexta Victrix kept garri&s;on; as al&s;o the Cohors Quarta Gallorum, as the in&s;criptions found here prove.</P>

The town or out-buildings here have been chiefly to the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t of the fort; there being a &s;mall brook to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and a de&s;cent from the Station to it.

<P>It is plain from Camden's own account of his journey, that he went no further along the wall ea&s;tward, than a little beyond Carr-Voran. The altar now before us was erected to the Syrian godde&s;s. Lucian among the ancients, and Selden among the moderns, have profe&s;&s;edly treated on the &s;ubject of this deity: and Sir I&s;aac Newton &s;ays, it is one of the names of Venus. It is very certain, that what is phy&s;ically the &s;ame, is often repre&s;ented by &s;everal deities; and the &s;ame deity has &s;everal names con&s;idered under different relations, or as confering different benefits. Thus Cybele, Ceres, Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta, Rhea, and Tellus, all &s;ignify the earth; and Dea Syria is only another of Cybele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s names, who is u&s;ually called the mother of the gods. The like may be &s;aid of Apollo and &s;everal others. As for the in&s;cription, the letters in the fir&s;t line, and CALP in the &s;econd, and part of the AG in the third, are yet very plain and di&s;tinct, though the re&s;t of it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce Camden's time is entirely gone, together with the outer or upper Stratum of this part of the &s;tone, deeper than the cut of the letters, which obliges me to take mo&s;t of the in&s;cription from Camden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s copy: and this I have ob&s;erved to happen frequently when the in&s;cription is cut along the plane of the Stratum; but when it is cut acro&s;s, or through the &s;everal Strata, the letters are more la&s;ting, and much better &s;ecured; and thus the Romans u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y cut their in&s;criptions.

I think voto in the fifth line mu&s;t be ex voto, as u&s;ual, and then there is no difficulty as to the meaning. The writing part of the word libens, upon the plane of the altar, and part upon the ba&s;e, is ob&s;ervable, but the S. for &s;acrum, in the end of the fourth line, is not uncommon.

I find no centurial mark in the in&s;cription, unle&s;s the C at the begin|ning of the la&s;t line, which Mr Gordon overlooked, be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand for Centurio; or el&s;e the mark before LEG, through mi&s;take turned the wrong way. But I rather take this to be only a &s;top, and the C to be the Praenomen of the per&s;on. There is nothing very peculiar in manner of this in&s;cription, unle&s;s it be the humour of making the &s;ize of the letters in the diffe|rent lines &s;o very unequal.</P>

<P N="57">LVII. Antoni &mdash; Pio&mdash;</P>
<P>This is an imperfect in&s;cription upon the fragment of a very curious and beautiful &s;tone, the nature and grit of which is finer than u&s;ual, and the remaining letters very fair, and well cut. I can only gue&s;s that the in&s;cription may have been to the honour of one Antonines, and that the word in the &s;econd line may have been Pio, and perhaps Pra in the la&s;t for Prae&s;ectus.</P>
<P N="60">LX. This is a &s;mall but fine &s;tone, and a curious &s;culpture. It came from Little Che&s;ters, but is now in the jamb of a door at Ram&s;haw Field, a &s;ingle hou&s;e, about a mile or more &s;outh-we&s;t from this &s;tation. It has not been ob&s;erved or publi&s;hed before, though it very well de&s;erves a place in &s;uch a collection. The &s;culpture manife&s;tly repre&s;ents a Roman Verillum, with a Pega&s;us on one &s;ide, and a Sea-goat on the other; and in the Vexillum, an in&s;cription, in very &s;mall letters,

as I have given it. The fir&s;t line, except the cro&s;s &s;troke of the H. was very vi&s;ible. Vegetius tells us, it was the ancient cu&s;tom of the Romans, to put the number of the Cohort or Cen|tury upon the Vexillum, which was a &s;quare piece of cloth fa&s;tened upon a tran&s;ver&s;e piece of wood. This after Con&s;tantine had the name of Labarum.</P>

The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the unlettered reader on the&s;e acts of devotion, would mi&s;lead him into an idea, that the&s;e &s;acrifices were only
<PB N="56" REF="86">
a lavi&s;h de&s;truction of animal beings, under the irrational pre&s;umption, that the gods delighted in the &s;ervice of burning carca&s;&s;es: but by at|tending to the ceremony, we are relieved from this mi&s;take, and acquit this learned and poli&s;hed people of &s;uch an error again&s;t common &s;en&s;e. &mdash;From national prejudices they had a&s;&s;igned per&s;ons to the attributes of the Great Creator, whom they univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed; and pre&s;umed to depict them, as being di&s;tinct emanations from the &s;upreme, by the figures of Apollo, Bacchus, Pallas, Ceres, and all the multitude of their divine per&s;onages; yet by the intelligent and wi&s;e, the religious &s;ervices paid to the images of tho&s;e attributes, were in fact, and from the heart, addre&s;&s;ed to the God of Nature. Seneca &s;ays, <Q>'tis of very little con|&s;equence by what name you call <HI>the fir&s;t Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Divine Rea|&s;on</HI> which pre&s;ides over the univer&s;e, and fills all the parts of it; he is &s;till the &s;ame God. He is called Jupiter Stator, not as hi&s;torians &s;ay, becau&s;e he &s;topped the flying armies of the Romans, but becau&s;e he is the con&s;tant &s;upport of all beings&mdash;they call him Fate, becau&s;e he is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e on which all others depend. We Stoics &s;ometimes call him Father Bacchus, becau&s;e he is the univer&s;al Life that animates nature&mdash;Hercules, becau&s;e his Power is invincible&mdash;Mercury, be|cau&s;e he is the eternal Wi&s;dom, Order, and Rea&s;on&mdash;you may give him as many names as you plea&s;e, provided you allow <HI>but one &s;ole Principle</HI> every where pre&s;ent.</Q>&mdash;Thus, if the Roman devotee peti|tioned for &s;ucce&s;s in war, he re&s;orted to the temple of Mars, or rai&s;ed to him an altar; and &s;o on, through the chain of tho&s;e images, with which their pantheon was crowded.</P>
<P>This error aro&s;e very early in the world; and before letters commu|nicated wi&s;dom and &s;cience, it is no wonder it prevailed almo&s;t univer|&s;ally among mankind&mdash;the eye carries images to the mind mo&s;t imme|diately&mdash;the mind thus impre&s;&s;ed was warmed into an energy, which nothing but outward objects could convey to the ignorant. Be&s;ides, we find tho&s;e per&s;onages, who had rendered them&s;elves important to their country, and by their &s;uperior talents and virtues, won the love of the people, in commemoration of &s;uch their excellencies, had their images erected, and became repre&s;entatives of the divine attributes.&mdash; Here we trace a &s;trong influence to promote devotion; the love borne to the very per&s;on who&s;e image was &s;o erected. The danger to religion among the vulgar is obvious, and was proved in the event: the great architype was forgotten, and the &s;moaky and inanimate &s;tatue became the idol of the vulgar wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="87">Let us now examine the &s;acrificial rites.&mdash;The altars which remain in Britain, are chiefly formed of one &s;tone, like the pede&s;tal of a column: above the cornice are two rolls, commonly called the horns of the altar; the centre ri&s;es in a conical figure, in which is an aperture, wherein was placed the charcoal and embers for the ceremony. The&s;e altars were fixed before the &s;tatue of the God to whom the devotee paid his rites, or at the O&s;tium of the temple, which during the time had its gates thrown open; or otherwi&s;e, they were erected in groves, con&s;e|crated to the Divinity: the Prie&s;t, together with the devotee, dre&s;&s;ed in white garments (emblematical of purity and innocence, characteri&s;tics pre&s;umed mo&s;t acceptable to heaven) went foremo&s;t in the proce&s;&s;ion. The animal ordered for &s;acrifice had its horns gilt, or its forehead bound with white fillets, decked with garlands, and crowned with the leaves of that tree, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Deity mo&s;t affected; but in fact, that which was e&s;teemed emblematical of the peculiar virtue of the Deity then addre&s;&s;ed. Several attendants walked in the proce&s;&s;ion, among&s;t whom were the public Crier, the Mu&s;icians, the Aru&s;pex or Diviner, and all tho&s;e who&s;e office it was to &s;laughter and dre&s;s the animal. As &s;oon as the Victim was brought, the Prie&s;t, laying one hand on the horns of the altar, began the ceremony with a mo&s;t &s;olemn and devout prayer, either for the public weal, or the private pro&s;perity of the devotee offering &s;acrifice, as the occa&s;ion required. The &s;acred fire being placed in the aperture of the altar, the Prie&s;t &s;trewed corn and frankincen&s;e, meal and &s;alt, upon the head of the animal; then taking the Patera, (a &s;hallow ba&s;on) in which was contained the wine, he touched it with his lips, and after giving it to tho&s;e who &s;tood near him to do the &s;ame, poured it between the horns of the bea&s;t; then plucking &s;ome hair from between them, he ca&s;t it into the fire, and turning his face to the ea&s;t, drew his knife along the animal's &s;pine, from head to tail, as the en&s;ign or mark of con&s;ecration: after which, the inferior officers performed the &s;laughter. The carca&s;s being opened, the Aru&s;pex examined the inte&s;tines, and if deformed, deficient, or di&s;|ea&s;ed, he pronounced the omens inau&s;picious: if on the contrary, healthy and vigorous, the heart large, and the animal parts &s;trong, the in|dications were propitious. After this ceremony, particular &s;mall parts were placed on the embers, to occa&s;ion a plea&s;ant &s;avour, and the re&s;t was dre&s;&s;ed for a &s;olemn fe&s;tival. Here we view the ceremony in its proper light: the &s;acrificial rites were no more than a public exhibition of the cattle, given on &s;ome &s;ingular occa&s;ion, when they were pre&s;ented

To reform the abu&s;es of the heathen world, we have too much aboli&s;hed ceremony; and from fervour, have fallen into a &s;lovenly lethargic indolence, which comprehends &s;o little of piety, that men often find their minds, even during the act of kneeling, ab&s;tracted from the Divinity, and wandering in worldly occupations. We have taken away the idol, which betrayed the vulgar, but have left them in &s;uch jeopardy, that few even remember there is a God. Religious rites warm the mind: pure and &s;entimental devotion only befits the mo&s;t enligh|tened, and mo&s;t learned: ceremonies catch attention, as it were in wiles; and tho&s;e who would think little of prayer, may &s;ometimes be induced thereto almo&s;t involuntarily, by joining in, or being pre&s;ent at religious rites. The &s;oul full of wi&s;dom, wor&s;hips in &s;ilence; but wayward minds &s;oon &s;ink away from &s;uch &s;piritual &s;ervice. The contemplation of the Deity, by the enlightened and wi&s;e, is &s;o replete with wonder, and in|&s;pires &s;uch reverence, that &s;ilence becomes it be&s;t: but the ignorant mind conceives little more than its wants; and the God of miracles, with &s;uch, is concluded in the God of daily bread. I reverence the Roman in his &s;acrifice: it was a noble exhibition of piety; an augu&s;t mode of &s;upplicating the Deity. The &s;olemnity of craving a grace on the appointed fe&s;tival in the&s;e rites, was &s;trikingly devout. In this boa&s;ted age of chri&s;tianity, where is the devotion attendant on the hecatombs of a Lord Mayor's Fea&s;t. The hecatombs of the Ancients, were fe&s;tivals on great and memorable events, and were preceded by the mo&s;t &s;olemn rites of con&s;ecration;&mdash;a commencement of fe&s;tivity, worthy the imita|tion of the mo&s;t enlightened nations.</P>

occa&s;ion, through all they did, as a nation, as is no where el&s;e to be found in the lea&s;t comparable. To enumerate particulars, would make an agreeable volume. I can only take notice, that it makes a great part of their &s;tory. So hone&s;t, &s;o warm, &s;o grateful was their zeal to heaven, at every public act, that providence could not but look favourably upon them, wink at what they were ignorant of, as the the Apo&s;tle profe&s;&s;es, Acts xvii. 30. and pro&s;per them accordingly. Every &s;ingle per&s;on, of any note, had a part of his hou&s;e con&s;ecrated, like as our private chapels, called the Lararium. Upon every &s;ucce&s;s, we read of their vowing temples. On occa&s;ion of misfortune, pe&s;ti|lence, floods, thunder, and the like, they con&s;ult the oracles, order public lu&s;trations, &s;upplications, and &s;acrifices. Even their theatrical &s;pectacles began with an act of religion; many altars in their circs and places of games. They never began or ended a war, took up the military &s;tandards every morning, without an act of religion, a liba|tion of incen&s;e. In their kalendar, mo&s;t days in the year have &s;ome religious &s;olemnity. Look into their &s;culptures and monuments, and ob&s;erve the extravagant expence and pomp of their religious proce&s;|&s;ions: even their coins are counter-&s;igned with &s;ome Deity, and in|numerable &s;culptures of their Emperors &s;acrificing, incen&s;ing. They never began their harve&s;t, their vintage, without a &s;acrifice: without the <HI>Flamen Dialis</HI> gathering the fir&s;t bunch. The genius of the peo|ple and city were ever repre&s;ented with a Patera in its hand, before an altar incen&s;ing. In &s;hort, religion makes the greate&s;t part of the hi&s;tory; the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e authors that write of their cu&s;toms; the greate&s;t part of the monuments, coins, and &s;culptures, which are now come to our hands, of this truly magnanimous and virtuous people. And if we read Polybius particularly, we obtain a ju&s;t idea of the noble &s;pirit, the honour, and uprightne&s;s of the Roman &s;enate, which made them courted by all the world. Religion cannot be &s;e|parated from Roman hi&s;tory, becau&s;e, in <HI>their</HI> way, they were the mo&s;t religious of all people; and for that rea&s;on, Providence gave them the Empire of the World.</Q></P>

The area of the mo&s;t northerly part of the Station is nearly plain; but the &s;outh part is more upon a de|&s;cent than any other Station that I remember. I think the Praetorium is vi&s;ible, and the ruins of a temple near it. The va&s;t ruins of the Roman Station and Town are truly wonderful; and a great number of in&s;criptions and &s;culptures have been found, and many yet remain at this place. The town or out-buildings have &s;tood upon a gentle declivity, to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t of the Station, where there are &s;treets, or &s;omewhat that looks like terra&s;&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The be&s;t view of the walls, and the greate&s;t variety, is between Walwick and Hou&s;e-&s;teads.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From this Station there &s;eems to have gone a military way to Little Che&s;ters, &s;ome faint ve&s;tiges of which I thought I ob&s;erved, but was not certain. As &s;uch a military way might be of &s;ervice for march|ing forces from one of the&s;e Stations to the other, &s;o it might al&s;o be further u&s;eful, for a more convenient pa&s;&s;age from Hou&s;e-&s;teads to Carr-Voran, or to any other Stations along the wall more we&s;terly. Near to this way, and to that part of Hou&s;e-&s;teads where a temple is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood, are &s;ome old wrought quarries, now grown over with gra&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The di&s;tance between Little Che&s;ters and Hou&s;e-&s;teads is about a mile and three quarters, and the di&s;tance between Hou&s;e-&s;teads and that part of the wall which is directly oppo&s;ite to Little Che&s;ters is about a mile and three furlongs; and in this &s;pace there are two vi|&s;ible Ca&s;tella, the interval between which &s;eems to be ju&s;t about &s;ix furlongs. This is the lea&s;t interval between any two Ca&s;tella upon the whole track of the wall; the rea&s;on of which may be the di&s;tance of the Station at Little Che&s;ters from the wall.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="93">The headle&s;s effigies of the Deae Matres remain on the &s;pot (they are &s;aid to be the tutelary Deities of the Fore&s;t of Lowes); are repre&s;ented attired in a &s;hort robe to the knee, each holding &s;omething circular be|tween their hands; &s;uppo&s;ed to be the work of the Thracian or Syrian Auxiliaries; and are of rude and ill-proportioned &s;culpture. Mr Wallis &s;ays, on Chapel Hill, a place not far di&s;tant, the Romans had a temple on the eminence, where fragments of Doric capitals were found not many years ago, one con&s;i&s;ting of two toru&s;&s;es plain, and many broken columns.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Hor&s;ley's work contains the following In&s;criptions and Sculptures found at this Station.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Jovi Optimo Maximo et Numinibus Augu&s;ti Cohors Prima Tungrorum militum cui praee&s;t Quintus Virius Super&s;tes Praefectus.</P>
<P>This and the following altars were dug up at a place now called the Chapel Hill, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ruins of a con&s;iderable temple. The in&s;criptions were, not long after the di&s;covery of them, publi&s;hed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, by Dr Hunter, by Mr Warburton, and lately again by Mr Gordon: they are al&s;o in Camden's Britannia. The unu&s;ual &s;hape of the I in the capital is remarkable: the Tungri mentioned in this and the following in&s;criptions, were a people of Belgic Gaul. The next thing which de&s;erves con&s;ideration is, what we are to under&s;tand by Numina Augu&s;ti in this and other in&s;criptions, where tho&s;e words occur: Wri|ters are not agreed as to this, and probably it has not always the &s;ame meaning: here and in &s;ome other in&s;tances, it &s;hould &s;eem, as if tho&s;e Deities were meant, to which the Emperor was peculiarly devoted; and that they who erected the altars, complimented the Emperor, by pay|ing honour and profe&s;&s;ing their devotion to the &s;ame Deities. We find &s;everal in&s;criptions in Gruter, that are con&s;ecrated Numinibus Augu&s;ti, and one like this I. O. M. et Numinibus Augu&s;ti: and that addre&s;&s;es were made to the Gods in behalf of the Emperors, notwith&s;tanding they were often complimented as Deities them&s;elves, is likewi&s;e evident from many of their coins, on which we have Jovi, Apollini, Marti, Mercurio, con&s;evatori Augu&s;ti, with &s;everal others of a like nature: however &s;ome have thought, that if this interpretation &s;hould be ad|mitted, Jupiter Optimus Maximus would be excluded from the number of the Emperors Deities; but in an&s;wer to this it may be &s;aid, that either the words may be &s;o under&s;tood as if it had been expre&s;&s;ed, Jovi Optimo Maximo et (ceteris) Numinibus Augu&s;ti, or el&s;e that Jupiter is by way of eminency, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Lares or tutelar Gods of the Emperor, which were often many in number, and made up partly of decea&s;ed per&s;ons, as well as other fictitious Deities. So Flavius Vopi&s;cus, in his life of Aurelius, &s;peaking of his going into the temple of Helioga|balus, &s;ays, <Q>There he found that image of the Deity which he &s;aw favouring him in the war:</Q> and Julius Capitolinus, in the life of Aurelius, addre&s;&s;ed to the Emperor Diocle&s;ian, &s;ays, <Q>The &s;tatues of Marcus Antoninus are to this day &s;et up in many hou&s;es among the fa|mily Deities;</Q> and &s;oon after, <Q>He is to this time e&s;teemed a God, as you always thought, and do think, mo&s;t &s;acred Emperor Diocle&s;ian, who wor&s;hip him among your Deities, not as the re&s;t, but in a peculiar manner.</Q> But in &s;ome other in&s;criptions the word Numina, in the plural, is applied to a particular Deity; &s;o we have Numina Dianae in Horace, and in Virgil, Numina Phoebi; and what comes nearer to our purpo&s;e, the &s;ame poet, when &s;peaking of Augu&s;tus him&s;elf, and by his &s;ordid flattery ranking him among the Gods; but uncertain where to place him, u&s;es the&s;e words:
<Q><L>Au Deus immen&s;i venias maris, actua nautae</L>
<L>Numina &s;ola colant.</L></Q>
<PB N="64" REF="94">On the other hand, Numen in the &s;ingular is &s;ometimes joined to a plurality of Deities, as in Virgil:

<P N="37">XXXVII. Jovi Optimo Maximo et Numinibus Augu&s;ti, Cohors Prima Tungrorum cui praee&s;t Quintus Julius Maximus Praefectus.</P>
<P>It is plain by the tenor of this in&s;cription, the I. O. M. Jovi Optimo Maximo, was placed in the capital, as well as it appears to be in that of the former, though nothing of this nature appears in any of the copies which have been publi&s;hed before; but upon a clo&s;e view of the original, I plainly di&s;covered the I. but could not perceive neither O. nor M. This however inclines me to charge this defect rather on time and the weather, than upon the workmen; but without the&s;e letters, it is evident that the &s;en&s;e of the in&s;cription is not compleat, the ET with which it beg as on the plane of the altar, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ing &s;omewhat on the capital. On one &s;ide of this altar is a Praefericulum, and on the other a Patera, each included in a waved ornament. I dare not venture po&s;itively to &s;ay, the&s;e in&s;criptions are as old as Antoninus Pius, though I know of no other in this form but the&s;e here at Hou&s;e-&s;teads, and one upon the altar at Benwell, which la&s;t expre&s;sly mentions this Emperor; nor do I think, that any objection, again&s;t this antiquity of them, can be taken from the cut of the letters, or the numeral &s;troke above the I, which have nothing in them that favours the lower times: I only add, that &s;ome gentlemen choo&s;e to read the&s;e in&s;criptions Cohortis Primae Tungrorum Milites.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII.</P>
<P>This is a large and very fine altar, but the in&s;cription entirely gone: I have given a re|pre&s;entation of one &s;ide of it, becau&s;e the Patera and ornaments about it &s;eemed to be &s;in|gular: perhaps the circle and cro&s;s line at the bottom, may repre&s;ent the place of the Patera in the temple. Mr Gordon &s;ays, there were five or &s;ix altars within the ruins of this temple. I &s;aw no more here but the two preceding; the re&s;t which that gentleman de&s;cribes, with a good many more &s;culptures and altars lying at the bottom of a field, &s;outh-ea&s;t of the Station, in which field remain the vi&s;ible ruins of &s;treets and buildings</P>

<PB N="65" REF="95">The globe on the ba&s;e of the altar is remarkable, and the letter A is without a tran&s;ver&s;e. The in&s;cription is well cut, and has nothing of the lower Empire in it.</P>

<P>Probably this may be later than the former; it is dedicated to Hercules, by the &s;ame Co|hort, under a new Commander, Publius Aelius Mode&s;tus. Nothing more is remarkable in it.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. Matribus. Cohors Prima Tungrorum.</P>
<P>This is to the Deae Matres. The name of the Cohort is very plain and di&s;tinct, and part of the word Matribus, but the re&s;t is obliterated, only half of a V appears in the under line, which I take to be the V in the la&s;t &s;yllable of Tungrorum: but the Commander's name, if it ever has been mentioned, is not now vi&s;ible. The&s;e Matres are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been local Deities, and wor&s;hipped at this place.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. Jovi Optimo Maximo, and at the bottom, Praefectus.</P>
<P>This is another fine altar here, erected to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, and I believe by the &s;ame Cohort; though the names both of the Commander and Cohort are now de&s;troyed by the weather, and only part of the word Praefectus left vi&s;ible upon the plane of the &s;tone. I cannot find that this altar has been publi&s;hed before.</P>
<P>Mr Warburton has given us a funeral in&s;cription at this place, in his Map of Northumber|land, which I could no where meet with upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry. According to his repre|&s;entation, it is thus:
<Q><L>DM</L>
<L>HVRMIO</L>
<L>LE. VBASNI</L>
<L>MIL CoH I</L>
<L>TVNGROR</L>
<L>BE PRAEF</L>
<L>CAPURIS</L>
<L>HER. E. C.</L></Q>
This copy is without doubt incorrect, though the main de&s;ign is obvious enough. The &s;ame Cohort of the Tungrians is plainly mentioned, and enough be&s;ide to &s;hew, that it was now under a different Commander, from any of tho&s;e who&s;e names occur in the former in&s;criptions. I imagine we mu&s;t read it, <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s manibus Hurmio Leuba&s;inus miles Cohortis Primae Tungrorum cui praee&s;t</HI> (perhaps <HI>Capurnus</HI> or <HI>Capurnius) haeredes &s;ecerunt.</HI> It is plain that this may ju&s;tly be reckoned among the in&s;criptions, in which the name of this Cohort di&s;tinctly appears, under five different Commanders, be&s;ides two or three more which are doubtful, by rea&s;on of their being defaced. The&s;e in&s;criptions &s;trongly prove this place to be <HI>Borcovius,</HI> the &s;tation upon the wall where, according to the <HI>Notitia,</HI> this Cohort was in garri&s;on.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. Centurio Legionis Sextae Victricis Piae Fidelis votum &s;olvit libenti&s;&s;ime merito.</P>
<P>This in&s;cription is upon a piece of an altar, the upper part being broken off and lo&s;t. It has been publi&s;hed in the Philo&s; Tran&s;actions by Dr Hunter, and more lately by Mr Gordon. But in both, the remains of two imperfect letters in the break at the top are neglected: and yet I take the&s;e to be material, becau&s;e the la&s;t is plainly the half of an inverted C, the u&s;ual mark
<PB N="66" REF="96">of a Century or Centurion. But the name of this Centurion of the 6th Legion, and the God to whom the altar was dedicated, are gone. The in&s;cription, as to that part of the form of it, may be compared to the altars and in&s;criptions upon them at Benwell. I read LL liben|ti&s;&s;ime, becau&s;e it is &s;upported by the be&s;t authorities, and &s;eems al&s;o the mo&s;t ea&s;y and na|tural. Some chu&s;e to read Libens Lubens, as the words occur at length in &s;ome in&s;criptions; and others read Libens Laetus, from the expre&s;&s;ion of Cloanthus in his vow.</P>

<L>Vobis Laetus ego hoc candentem in littore Taurum,</L>

<P>But I keep to the u&s;ual reading. Sometimes we have MM, which mu&s;t be read Meriti&s;&s;imo.</P>
<P N="45">XLV.</P>
<P>At this place al&s;o are &s;everal curious &s;culptures, mo&s;t of which are de&s;cribed by Mr Gordon, and in the main very ju&s;tly. But the account we have of them in Camden's Britannia, &s;eems to me not &s;o exact. For what is there called a Mercury, is plainly a Victory. And we are told of the &s;tatues of Jupiter, Bacchus, and a Flamen, which by all I can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cern, are only the figures of two Roman &s;oldiers, and three female figures, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Deae Ma|tres or Campe&s;tres. The fir&s;t is a Victory &s;tanding upon a globe on the right foot, the left being ca&s;t behind in the attitude of alighting, or of taking flight. On her head is a cap of a Conic figure; &s;he is naked to the wai&s;t, from a girdle a ve&s;t hangs in plaits to near the knee, and from thence a flowing robe, open before, which &s;hews the right leg: the arms are broken off by the wri&s;ts: the wings are half elevated. The &s;culpture is good, in alto relievo, and the figure is placed in a nich.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI.</P>
<P>This is al&s;o in alto relie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, being the figure of a Roman &s;oldier at length, in the u&s;ual mi|litary dre&s;s; his bow in his left re&s;ting one end on the ground, and his poinard in his right; his &s;word hung by his &s;ide at his girdle, and his quiver with arrows behind his right &s;houlder. This figure al&s;o &s;tands within a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII.</P>
<P>This is the figure of another &s;oldier in his accoutrements, but &s;omewhat imperfect His two belts are vi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le, cro&s;&s;ing each other agreeable to the de&s;cription of Ajax's armour in Homer. The broader belt over the right &s;houlder mu&s;t have been that of the &s;hield, as we learn from the &s;ame poet.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII.</P>
<P>The&s;e are three female figures &s;eated. The draught given by Mr Hor&s;ley, he &s;ays, was taken from the originals. They are naked to the wai&s;t, and their legs naked up to the knees, and therefore (he &s;ays) I know not the rea&s;on why Mr Gordon, who publi&s;hed them before, has drawn them with their legs covered down to the ancles. The figures have lo&s;t their heads. The&s;e are not improbably &s;uppo&s;ed to be local Godde&s;&s;es, or the Deae Matres or Cam|pe&s;tres. We have three female figures repre&s;ented together at two other places in this Roman Station, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe in their order. The ve&s;&s;els which the&s;e three have in their hands, appear not unlike the Colathus or Modius, on the heads of Sorapis and Fortune, and oft upon the heads of the Roman Emperors; which may favour the opinion of their being the Deae Campe&s;tres, who in the&s;e parts had the care of corn and country affairs, and were &s;uppo&s;ed to give plenty. Whether the&s;e ve&s;&s;els be of that &s;ort, or whether they repre&s;ent tho&s;e in which the &s;ortes or lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s were ca&s;t, (which al&s;o might be a proper attribute of the Deae Matres) and
<PB N="67" REF="97">whether there being three in number has any relation to the number of the Parcae, I &s;hall leave to others to explain. Perhaps their &s;avage dre&s;s may have &s;ome reference to that madne&s;s which was always a&s;cribed to the Matres, or ancient Prophete&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX.</P>
<P>About a furlong or le&s;s to the ea&s;t, near the &s;ide of a brook, and clo&s;e to a hedge, are three other female figures, &s;eated, each in a &s;eparate chair. Mr Gordon takes notice of two only, but a third was al&s;o lying near the others, covered with gra&s;s and bu&s;hes. The heads and hands are broken off from all the three, and the drapery is &s;omewhat different in all of them. They are intended to be repre&s;ented as &s;itting. The fir&s;t in the plate is naked to the wai&s;t, her ve&s;t makes &s;everal folds above the knee, and falls about half way down to her ancles; the re&s;t of the legs covered with a kind of &s;tockings. The &s;econd is naked to the wai&s;t, the gar|ment al&s;o forms many folds about the knees, and falls about half way down the legs, which are naked to the feet. The chair in which this figure is placed, has two &s;ide feet and a center foot, round which a cord is twi&s;ted, pa&s;&s;ing thrice round each leg, as binding the figure to the chair. The third figure has its ve&s;t up &s;o as to conceal the brea&s;ts, the robe de&s;cends a little below the knees, from whence the lower parts of the legs are naked. Mr Ward &s;ubjoins, <Q>I am inclined to think the&s;e &s;ix figures were originally placed in &s;ome temple, built in the Ro|man town adjoining to this Station, together with the three following, whom I do not take to be Deities, but rather Prie&s;te&s;&s;es, two of which hold &s;ome &s;ort of ve&s;&s;el in their right hands, as a &s;ymbol of their office. The difference of their habit &s;eems to favour this opinion, like|wi&s;e that of their po&s;ture; for they are &s;tanding, which is the po&s;ture of attendants, but the others &s;it, which was always e&s;teemed a po&s;ture of Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>At this place there lies a broken altar of the large&s;t &s;ize, but no vi&s;ible letters upon it.</P>
<P N="50">L.</P>
<P>In the Station it&s;elf, and again&s;t a hedge, were three other female figures, but &s;tanding, which are publi&s;hed likewi&s;e by Mr Gordon. The Sea Goat and two fi&s;hes above, mu&s;t pro|bably have &s;ome reference to Britain's being an i&s;land. The Sea Goat occurs in &s;ome other &s;culptures found in the north.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els which the&s;e hold in their hands, do not appear like the Patera. They may po&s;&s;i|bly be intended for Va&s;es of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e in the hands of the three &s;itting, only in another po&s;ition. If they are ve&s;&s;els into which the Sortes were put, the&s;e figures may repre|&s;ent the action of throwing them out. It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that Virgil in the Prophecy of Helenus, u&s;es the expre&s;&s;ion &s;ortiri fata for the decrees of heaven.</P>
<Q><L>"Sic fata deum Rex</L>
<L>"Sortitur."</L></Q>
<P>In the &s;culpture in&s;cribed Deabus Mairabus in Mont&s;aucon, the Godde&s;&s;es are repre&s;ented &s;tanding, in an attitude not very unlike the&s;e. The middle figure there holds fruit, either in a ve&s;&s;el or in the folding of her garment; the figure on the right hand holds a ve&s;&s;el he calls a Patera, and &s;he on the left holds a branch downwards. That great Antiquary ob&s;erves, that the Ancients u&s;ually made three of tho&s;e Godde&s;&s;es that were wor&s;hipped in the plural number, whether good or bad; as the Gorgons, the Graeae, the daughters of Phorcus; as al&s;o the Parcae, the Sirenes, the Harpyies, the He&s;perides, the Stymphalides, the Graces, nay even the Sibyls, and the Mu&s;es according to the mo&s;t ancient authors.</P>
<P N="51"><PB N="68" REF="98">LI.</P>
<P>Mr Gordon, when upon the &s;pot with Baron Clark, dog up from the ruins of the Roman town here, a &s;mall &s;tatue of a &s;oldier in the Roman military habit, holding a &s;pear in his right hand, and re&s;ting with his left upon a &s;hield. This is now in the Baron's collection.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in the &s;ame honourable per&s;on's collection, two other &s;mall altars found here; but as they have no in&s;criptions, or any thing remarkable about them, I have not given the draughts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e, there are likewi&s;e &s;everal other pieces of &s;culptures, altars, pede&s;tals, and pillars &s;cattered here and there; and one piece of a fine channelled pillar lying in the mid&s;t of the Station. There may be two or three other Stations in Britain (as Burdo&s;wald, Elenbo|rough, and Lanche&s;ter) that exceed this in number of in&s;criptions; but none I think equal it, as to the extent of the ruins of the town, or the number, variety, and curio&s;ity of the &s;culp|tures which yet remain here.</P>
<P>There is one in&s;cription more which belongs to this place, that was publi&s;hed in the Tran&s;ac|tions by Dr Hunter, &s;everal years ago. The Doctor &s;ays the &s;tone lay again&s;t a hedge, at about a quarter of a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le di&s;tance. I my&s;elf &s;aw a &s;tone in a hedge, which I believe to have had a &s;epulchral in&s;cription upon it, and at nearly this di&s;tance; but there was not one letter vi&s;ible upon it. The in&s;cription was imperfect when the Doctor &s;aw it, who gave it thus:

<HEAD>CARRAW-BROUGH,</HEAD>
<P>near the 25th mile-&s;tone, the Roman Station Procolitia, garri&s;oned by the fir&s;t Cohort of the Batavians. Severus's military way appears to enter the ea&s;t gate of the fort, and go out at the we&s;t. A great part of
<PB N="66" REF="96">
the rampart here &s;till continues very entire, e&s;pecially on the ea&s;t &s;ide; and Severus's wall, which forms the north rampart, is in good pre&s;er|vation. The ditch is mo&s;t vi&s;ible on the we&s;t. Here it may plainly be &s;een, that the corners of the forts were not &s;trictly angular, but turned off in a quarter of a circle.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="97">According to Mr Hor&s;ley, the buildings without this fort have been chiefly on the we&s;t &s;ide, where, &s;ome years ago, a well was di&s;covered with a good &s;pring: the receptacle for the water is about &s;even feet &s;quare within, and built on all &s;ides with hewn &s;tone: it is now almo&s;t filled up with rubbi&s;h. There had al&s;o been a wall about it, or a hou&s;e built over it.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="98">From this fort to the village of Carraw, Hadrian's Vallum and ditch are not very con&s;picuous; but Severus's wall is very vi&s;ible, though the ditch is ob&s;cure. About half a mile &s;outh-we&s;t from Carraw, upon a high ground, is a &s;quare fort, now called Broom-dykes: it is as large as the fort of Carraw-brough, and probably has been for exploration, or for the Ae&s;tiva of this fort About half-way between Carraw and Thropfell-hou&s;e, there &s;eems to be &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the &s;maller military way, &s;uppo&s;ed to have gone clo&s;e by Severus's wall, from turret to turret.</P>
<P>For about a mile the walls keep near to each other, and for that &s;pace are them&s;elves and all their members very large and con&s;picuous; &s;e|veral of the regular &s;tones appear in Severus's wall, and the united mi|litary way is very noble. After this the walls part, and take different cour&s;es. The north Agger of Hadrian's fortification, continues after the
<PB N="69" REF="99">
&s;eparation large and high; is mixed with &s;tones, though no regular pavement appears: whereas Severus's military way, after this parting, appears little rai&s;ed, but regularly paved. Hadrian's Vallum keeps the low ground all the way, whil&s;t Severus's runs along the brink of the precipices, which in &s;ome places &s;eem to have been made &s;teeper by art, in order to render them more inacce&s;&s;able. For this rea&s;on Severus's wall is for this &s;pace very crooked, whil&s;t Hadrian's in the main is pretty &s;traight. They have made no ditch to Severus's work, when they had the advantage of a precipice; nor was there the lea&s;t occa&s;ion: but in the&s;e intervals between the rocks, they have often drawn a ditch, and in the&s;e places u&s;ually erected their Ca&s;tella.</P>
<P>After their &s;eparation, Severus's military way accompanies the wall pretty clo&s;ely, and is generally, for the whole &s;pace that the walls con|tinue &s;o far parted, vi&s;ible and di&s;tinct; yet the way does not follow every &s;maller winding of the wall, upon the tops of the precipices, but generally takes a &s;horter cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;es along the &s;lope of the hill, from Ca&s;tellum to Ca&s;tellum, in the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t convenient line that it can: this is very remarkable at the fir&s;t great turn of the wall, after it enters upon the precipices. The wall it&s;elf is almo&s;t all this way vi&s;ible, in an eminent degree, and &s;ometimes it only wants the battle|ments, as near Bu&s;y Gap, which is an aperture or pa&s;s between the hills &s;o called, where there is an opportunity of cro&s;&s;ing the wall on hor&s;eback. Thus it pa&s;&s;es by Shewing-&s;heels Hou&s;es, leaving Shewing-&s;heels Ca&s;tle on the north. Mr Hor&s;ley further ob&s;erves, that this Ca&s;tle, or &s;omething el&s;e near it, is called a &s;quare Roman Ca&s;tle, in the new edition of Camden; and Camden him&s;elf thought this was the Station of Hunnum: but he &s;ays, he &s;aw nothing that was Roman about it. The Ca&s;tle it&s;elf, (in ruins) and the Moats about it, are undoubtedly of a much later date. And he adds, I ob&s;erved &s;everal trenches there|abouts, particularly a large and long one, which reaches from Bu&s;y Gap cro&s;s the pa&s;&s;es between the mountains. But the&s;e are all on the north &s;ide of the wall, and mu&s;t certainly have been made in later times, for &s;ecuring the neighbouring pa&s;&s;es. Probably they are no older than the times of our famous Mo&s;s Troopers, who might conveniently &s;helter them&s;elves among the&s;e hideous mountains and mo&s;&s;es. The height of one of the&s;e rocks is near forty yards perpendicular;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warburton, p. 58. Hor&s;ley's Brit. Rom</NOTE> but in other parts
<PB N="70" REF="100">
they are con&s;iderably higher. As &s;uch &s;teep rocks are a &s;ufficient fence of them&s;elves, the wall has not in the&s;e parts had either &s;trength or thickne&s;s, equal to what it has had in others. The remains here are not &s;o con&s;iderable, though it &s;eems very improbable that any of the &s;tones, e&s;pecially in &s;ome places, could have been removed. In the hol|lows between the rocks, be&s;ides the addition of the ditch and a Ca&s;tel|lum here and there, the wall it&s;elf &s;eems to have been &s;tronger and thicker. Where there is a &s;mall break of the precipice inward, the wall forms an internal angle, fetching a compa&s;s. In other ca&s;es, it pa&s;&s;es directly from one rock to another, and then is u&s;ually continued down the &s;ide of the one, and up the &s;ide of the other, except where the de&s;cent is almo&s;t perpendicular, in which ca&s;e it is only carried clo&s;e to the &s;ide of the rock, beginning again at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; which was all that was needful or practicable.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between Hou&s;e-&s;teads and Carraw-brough is &s;omewhat more than four miles and five furlongs. All the Ca&s;tella between the&s;e two Stations are very vi&s;ible, being five in number, but their di&s;tances are a little unequal. The two fir&s;t intervals from Carraw-brough are ju&s;t &s;even furlongs, but the next is only &s;ix. There is a turret near Bu&s;y Gap, the di&s;tance of which from the neare&s;t Ca&s;tellum is, I find, ju&s;t one-fifth of the interval between that and the next Ca&s;tellum.</P>

<P>the country through which we had pa&s;&s;ed from Walton to Carraw was dreary, and had not our minds been engaged with objects of antiquity, would have proved weari&s;ome.

Stations defended by a &s;tone-built Vallum, were the permanent ones, and winter quarters: the encampments in &s;ummer were defended by a rampier of turf, with a pali&s;ado, (of which, as I mentioned before, I pre|&s;ume, the <HI>Corona Vallaris</HI> was a pattern, compo&s;ed of pointed &s;takes) and an outward ditch. Few, if any remains are left us of &s;uch, to a&s;certain their &s;ituation or magnitude. In a &s;quare of 170 paces by 130, there ap|pears room &s;ufficient for a <HI>Cohort,</HI> when lodged in tents or hovels of wood: but when in that &s;quare, you have allotted room for the <HI>Praetorium,</HI> with the apartments of the chief officers, what kind of tenements of ma&s;on-work mu&s;t there be erected in &s;treets, which &s;hould contain that number of people, with their accoutrements, wives, families, and hou&s;e|hold &s;tuff?&mdash;I &s;hould conceive, the excellent di&s;cipline of the Roman army would not admit the women within the wall of the camp, except only in time of imminent peril; but that they were lodged in the &s;uburbs.&mdash; The enquiry naturally brings on this re&s;ult, that tho&s;e edifices who&s;e remains now appear in &s;ome of the Roman Stations, (for they are not in all) are of more modern date, were built (after the Romans for&s;ook this i&s;land) by the Britons, or their Saxon allies, and aro&s;e in that Aera in which the appellation of <HI>Caer</HI> or City was given to many of them. The Britons, in their di&s;pirited &s;ituation on the final retreat of the Ro|mans, would nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ort to tho&s;e barriers and &s;trongholds, which the Romans had filled. I am induced to believe, that no ca&s;tle of any con&s;iderable magnitude was erected by the Romans in this country: the <HI>Ca&s;tellum</HI> or Turret on the walls, was not worthy the appellation of Ca&s;tle; being, as I before ob&s;erved, mo&s;t probably no more than a tower to guard the gate; or no better than a mere ba&s;tion to command the Vallum. Our ca&s;tles, of which &s;uch noble remains appear at this day, are of much more modern date, and derived from the Saxon and Nor|man vi&s;iters. The &s;tronge&s;t fortifications of the ancient Britons, were formed of piles of loo&s;e &s;tones, heaped to a ridge, and reduced into a circle, or a &s;quare. Such a <HI>Vallum</HI> was difficult to be &s;urmounted by a&s;&s;ailants. The <HI>Vallum</HI> of the Roman permanent Station, was built of hewn &s;tone, in&s;ide and out: tho&s;e which I have &s;een mo&s;t perfect (among which Lanche&s;ter, in the county of Durham, is one) were formed of &s;tones about 16 inches long, and 10 inches deep, of rough a&s;hler-work: the out&s;ide of the wall was perpendicular, and might, in its original &s;trength, be 14 or 15 feet high, and eight feet thick at the foot, but thining or decrea&s;ing on the in&s;ide towards the top, by &s;teps and grada|tions at the di&s;tance of about 16 inches, and the &s;ummit covered with a broad flat cape, having a parapet or pali&s;ado in front. Lanche&s;ter has
<PB N="79" REF="109">
four of tho&s;e &s;teps or gradations now remaining. The inter&s;tice be|tween the inward and outward ca&s;ing of a&s;hler-work, was filled with flat &s;tones, in an inclining po&s;ition, run full of lime mixed with &s;mall pebbles and rough gravel; &s;o that the cement is more impenetrable than the &s;tone it&s;elf: the angles were obtu&s;e, to &s;uit the &s;uper&s;tructure of an exploratory turret; or to give greater power to the garri&s;on, upon an a&s;&s;ault in annoying the enemy on their flanks. The gradations allowed them not only a power of a&s;cending the wall readily, but of lining it &s;everal ranks deep; tho&s;e at the top were at liberty to manage their &s;e|veral weapons and engines; tho&s;e below to u&s;e the bow; and the &s;oldiers engaged during an a&s;&s;ault, were ea&s;ily relieved when fatigued or wounded.</P>
<P>Some of the Stations had an entrance on each &s;ide, defended by a gate; but whether with a tower or not, it is difficult to a&s;certain, tho' it may rea&s;onably be conjectured.</P>

In its ea&s;tern cour&s;e, it &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ed through this Station, and cro&s;&s;ed the river North Tyne, ju&s;t below it, by a bridge; and at the di&s;tance of three miles and a half from thence, falls in with the great Ermin-&s;treet way, (by the country people called Wat|ling-&s;treet) in its cour&s;e between the &s;outh and north parts of Britain; which military way cro&s;&s;es, and &s;oon after coincides with another Ro|man way, called the Devil's Cau&s;eway, which enters into Scotland near to Berwick upon Tweed. Mr Warburton &s;ays, in his opinion this is (though contrary to the &s;entiments both of Mr Hor&s;ley and Mr Gordon) the true cour&s;e of the Roman road, called the Maiden Way; which they &s;uppo&s;ed to have terminated at <HI>Carr-Voran,</HI> or to have entered Scot|land by a &s;horter direction.</P>
<P>From <HI>Walwick Che&s;ters</HI> to the village of <HI>Walwick,</HI> Severus's wall and ditch are very ob&s;ervable; but Hadrian's Vallum, with what belongs to it, is more ob&s;cure. From hence, all the way to <HI>Carraw-brough,</HI> both the walls and their ditches are very con&s;picuous; and for mo&s;t part of the way, &s;everal regular cour&s;es of the original facing &s;tone, are to be &s;een in Severus's wall: the two works keep pretty clo&s;e together, and nearly parallel one to the other: the military way is within a chain or two of the wall. Taking all the works together, they are no where in the whole tract, more con&s;picuous and magnificent than they are here, at lea&s;t for &s;o long a &s;pace.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Towertay,</HI> there are five or &s;ix regular cour&s;es of the facing &s;tones of the wall: and a little we&s;t from thence, are large remains of a Ca&s;|tellum, detached about a yard from the wall, the rea&s;on of which is not very obvious.</P>

as an altar, with a female Deity, &s;uppo&s;ed by him to be Cybele; adjoining to which is the figure of a Lion, rai&s;ing the head of a man who lays pro&s;trate &mdash; the drawing is taken with accuracy. This, with the others at the Grange, appear to be merely monumental; and we were informed they were found to the ea&s;t of the camp, not far di&s;tant from the Vallum. The &s;culpture, I apprehend, was dedicated to the manes of &s;ome decea&s;ed per&s;onage of note. The lion is boldly relieved; his left foot is placed upon the head of a human figure, naked to the wai&s;t, the hands ca&s;t forward in the po&s;ition of one fallen. Separated from the&s;e, by a moulding, on the left hand of the &s;tone, is a human figure robed to the feet, a &s;pear re&s;t|ing on the left arm, a &s;mall altar at the right knee, and in the right hand what &s;eems to be a blazing torch. The con&s;truction I put upon the whole, when I &s;aw it, (though contrary to the conjectures of others) is, that it was erected to the memory of one who was &s;lain in battle, and that the figure to the left was in the act of incen&s;ing and perform|ing the rites and honours of the dead. The Romans on their monu|ments expre&s;&s;ed particular nations or people by &s;ome animal; &s;o the lion may denote &s;ome noble enemy. Scotch expeditions are by &s;ome authors &s;aid to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the figure of a boar.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Hor&s;ley repre&s;ents this monument &s;omewhat different; he makes the Lion turning his face from the per&s;on on who&s;e head he re&s;ts his foot, and the &s;tanding figure holds a key in his hand.&mdash;He gives the following thoughts upon it.</P>
<P><Q>This is but a coar&s;e, though I think a curious &s;culpture, which has never, as I know of, been publi&s;hed before. I fir&s;t imagined it to have been &s;epulchral, as mo&s;t of the other in|&s;criptions and &s;culptures are, which belong to this place. But if it be the mother of the Gods, who is here repre&s;ented, or any other principal Deity, the &s;tone has probably been of a more public nature. There is a broken &s;tone with an imperfect &s;culpture upon it at Cor|bridge, which I take to be of the &s;ame nature. The &s;culpture before us, repre&s;ents a female &s;eated, holding a key in her right hand, and I think a thyr&s;us or ha&s;ta in her left; and on the other part of the &s;tone, a human figure lying along, and a lion with one of his paws gently rai&s;ing up the head. The lion re&s;pects Cybele, the mother Godde&s;s, and the thyr&s;us and ha&s;ta are her common &s;ymbols, and &s;ometimes the key. And I am of opinion, that this is the figure of Cybele, the Syrian Godde&s;s; for as Montfaucon ob&s;erves, <HI>Dea Syria was one of the mo&s;t celebrated names of Cybele; and &s;he was &s;o called, becau&s;e much or chiefly wor|&s;hipped in Syria. The &s;ymbols were the &s;ame, a towered head, Lions, a Tympanum, Thyr&s;us, &amp;c.</HI> This &s;culpture then may very probably repre&s;ent Cybele, for both the key and the thyr&s;us were her &s;ymbols, by one of which was repre&s;ented the opening of the earth, and by the other the producing of wine. And as we have an altar at Little Che&s;ters devoted to her, this may &s;till render it more probable: and if it be Cybele who is here repre&s;ented, the lion that is gently rai&s;ing up the head of the human figure, may &s;ignify the revival of man, by the &s;pring and produce of the earth, or by the wine and fruits it affords: the lion does not &s;eem to be in a devouring po&s;ture, but rather guarding or cheri&s;hing. In the &s;culpture at Corbridge, the reviving figure has not been human, but &s;ome other animal; and the pro|duce of the earth re&s;tores and cheri&s;hes both man and bea&s;t.</Q></P></NOTE> In the wall of the &s;ame barn in which the la&s;t de&s;cribed &s;culpture is now placed, is a monumental in&s;cription, to which we could not pay &s;o much atten|tion as it required, to make it out, it being grown full of mo&s;s, and

<P>is a place of great antiquity; Bede called it Hangu&s;tald; by the old Engli&s;h Saxons it was named Hextolderham; and &s;ome authors (parti|cularly Camden) &s;ay it is the <HI>Axelodunum</HI> of the Romans, that name implying its high &s;ituation, by the application of the old Briti&s;h name <HI>Dunum,</HI> a hill, by <HI>Hextol,</HI> a little rivulet &s;o called, which wa&s;hes its we&s;tern foot.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Richard, a Prior of Hexham, who flouri&s;hed near 800 years ago, writes, <Q>Not far from the river Tyne, &s;outhward, there &s;tandeth a town, in the&s;e days of no great magnitude, and thinly inhabited: but in times pa&s;t, as the remains of antiquity bear witne&s;s, very large and &s;tately. This place is named <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tolde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ham,</HI> from a little rivulet which runs near it. Ethel|dreda, wife of King Egfrid, gave it to St Wilfrid, that it might be created an Epi&s;copal See, about the year 675. He built a church here, which for its beauty and excellent archi|tecture exceeded all the Mini&s;ters in England.</Q></P>
<P>William of Malm&s;bury writes, <Q>This was crown land when Wilfrid obtained it of Queen Etheldreda in Exchange. It was wonderful to &s;ee what buildings were erected there, with mighty high walls, and how they were &s;et out, and contrived with divers turnings in and out, by winding &s;tairs all poli&s;hed and garni&s;hed by the curious workman&s;hip of Ma&s;ons and <HI>Pargetters,</HI> whom the hope of his liberality had allured from Rome. So that the&s;e buildings carried the &s;hew of the Romi&s;h magnificence, and &s;tood very &s;trong, &s;truggling with time.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of our Antiquaries believe the origin of Hexham to be derived from the Romans. Camden &s;ays the fir&s;t Cohort of the Spaniards had

<P>In the reign of Egfrid King of Northumberland, A. D. 674, it was made an Epi&s;copal See by St Wilfrid, then Archbi&s;hop of York, who through the enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour of Etheldrida,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Etheldrida was daughter to Anna King of the Ea&s;t Angles, and was fir&s;t married to Ton|beret, a Grandee in her father's court, with whom &s;he lived a virgin three years. She lived with Egfrid 12 years, &s;till pre&s;erving her virginity. By uncea&s;ing importunities, &s;he prevailed with the King to permit her to retire to a nunnery. She received the veil from Finam Bi&s;hop of Lindisfern, in the abbey of Coldingham, then under the government of Ebba, the King's aunt. Bede, L. 4. Rich. Hagul. c. 1. Dugdale Mona&s;t. vol. 2.</NOTE> Egfrid's Queen, which that &s;kilful Eccle&s;ia&s;tic knew how to po&s;&s;e&s;s, the territory of Hexham|&s;hire was granted to the church of St Andrew, which he had founded. The church was rai&s;ed by workmen brought from Italy, and by Hi&s;to|rians of that time, &s;aid to exceed in beauty and elegance every other edifice in the land.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>On Chad's retiring, Wilfrid became &s;ole Bi&s;hop of Northumberland; that is, of all King O&s;way's dominions, which extended from the Humber to the Firth of Forth; and had been in|crea&s;ed by the conque&s;t he had lately made of Lincoln&s;hire, which was then part of the Mercian dominions, on the &s;outh of Humber. Be&s;ides this va&s;t dioce&s;e, Wilfrid had the government of nine abbies: and being ever ready to accept, and al&s;o to &s;olicit, the mo&s;t extravagant dona|tives, which the ignorant &s;uper&s;tition of the age prompted the great ones to be&s;tow, he built and adorned in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner his churches and abbies, employing in tho&s;e works, the mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;ts he could procure from France and Italy. His magnificence in other re|&s;pects was in no wi&s;e inferior, for in his family the &s;ons of many of the Northumbrian Nobles re&s;ided for their education, his attendants were numerous, his furniture &s;plendid, and at his table, he is &s;aid to have been &s;erved in gold. Bede, L. 4. R. Hagul&s;t. c. 3. Edd. c. 21.</P>
<P>His principal works were the reparation of the cathedral of York, the roof of which he co|vered with lead, and glazed its windows. A D. 670, and the building of the two magnificent churches of Ripon and Hexham. Eddius de&s;cribes him, as attended in his progre&s;&s;es, when performing his epi&s;copal functions, not only by his fingers, of whom Eddius him&s;elf was one, but by ma&s;ons and arti&s;ts of almo&s;t every kind. Ed c. 14. Wilfrid's adver&s;ity was derived from an aver&s;ion the King took again&s;t him, apprehending the Bi&s;hop had influenced the Queen to turn Nun. Which aver&s;ion was not a little increa&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop's immoderate wealth and ambition. Bede. L. 4. He died at his mona&s;try of Oundle, in Northampton&s;hire, and was buried in the church of St Peter, at Ripon. Bede gives his Epitaph, as follows:

<P>In Hexham were two Ho&s;pitals, one for Lepers, the other for the Sick, both well endowed.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of York enjoyed great privileges here; to enquire of which, a Quo Warranto was i&s;&s;ued in the 21&s;t year of the reign of King Edward I. to &s;hew <Q>by what authority he claimed to have all <HI>Capitulas</HI> of the Crown, delivered to his Bailiff, to be pleaded by Ju&s;|tices, whom he &s;hould a&s;&s;ign for that purpo&s;e, concerning all things ari&s;ing within his manor of Hextolder&s;ham; and that all pleas, as well of the Crown as other pleas, be pleaded by his writs, and his Ju&s;tices in his &s;aid manor to take and have the i&s;&s;ues and profits ari&s;ing thereby; and to do and execute by his officers, all things per|taining to the office of Sheriff and Coroner; and that no Bailiff of the King do enter into the &s;aid manor, to execute any office. And to have the cu&s;tody of pri&s;oners, and make delivery of them at his will. And to have market, gallows, chattels of fugitives and felons con|demned in the &s;aid manor, without leave of the King and his proge|nitors; which things do pertain to the King's crown and dignity.</Q>&mdash; To which the Bi&s;hop pleaded his claim from ancient time, and u&s;age from time immemorial;&mdash;in con&s;equence of which the&s;e privileges of a Palatine were confirmed by the King and Council. In the 13th year of the reign of King Edward III. Hexham had Jura Regalia confirmed, and the right of levying Tenths and Fifteenths.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd year of Henry the Fifth's reign, Hexham was &s;tripped of tho&s;e privileges, as being an a&s;ylum of thieves and robbers.</P>

of Henry VIII. retaining nothing but the &s;pecial juri&s;diction. In the 14th year of Queen Elizabeth, it was annexed to the county of Nor|thumberland; and the manor being &s;oon after &s;old, devolved on the late Sir Walter Calverly Blackett.</P>
<P>The remains of this ancient cathedral bear innumerable marks of magnificence. Many ancient tombs are here: within the quire is the recumbent effigy of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic hooded, on a table monument of black marble, in relief; at the foot, a &s;hield with uncommon arms, or rather an emblematical device to denote mortality, being the re&s;emblance of cro&s;s bones. The people who keep the doors, &s;ay it is the tomb of Prior Richard, an Hi&s;torian of the 12th century. He was &s;ome time a Monk here, and occurs Prior A. D. 1153. The device on the &s;hield, if it is pre&s;umed to be the tomb of Richard, will then appear to be the letters <HI>ri</HI> placed one over the other. Mr Wallis's Antiquities, which I have frequent occa&s;ion to quote, &s;ays <Q>the&s;e arms are argent, a &s;altier gules; and that contiguous to this tomb, an helmet is fixed, denoting that this per&s;onage, before he was an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, was of &s;ome mili|tary order.</Q> He al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es he was Prior here.&mdash;If it were not for the ample field of imagination, and inexhau&s;table conjectures, the em|ployment of Antiquaries would be dull indeed&mdash;I cannot forbear di&s;|&s;enting from this learned vi&s;iter.

<P><PB N="98" REF="130">A little below, in the &s;ame aile, is the tomb of Sir Robert Ogle, with the arms of Bertram and Ogles, quartered, and an in&s;cription in bra&s;s, dated 1404. The&s;e were ancient families in Northumberland; the Ogles owned &s;even Lords and thirty Knights of their race, having large po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions before the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>In the north aile is a monument in the wall, of &s;uch a form as u&s;u|ally de&s;igned at the building of churches, for founders or great bene|factors; but to what per&s;onage this belongs, is not known, no in&s;ignia or in&s;cription remaining. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the tomb of Alfwold, King of Northumberland, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated at Cilche&s;ter, by Sigga, a factious Lord of his Court, on the 23d of September, A. D. 788. I mea&s;ured an effigy which lays near this tomb, and found it an&s;wering exactly in length. The tomb is formed in an aperture made through the wall by an elegant piece of arched work. The effigy repre&s;ents an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic with his hood thrown back to his forehead, his hands ele|vated, and robed to the feet; the folds of the drapery thrown into ex|cellent order, ea&s;y and elegant.</P>
<P>On the &s;creen at the entrance of the quire, are &s;ome &s;trange mona&s;tic paintings, vulgarly &s;tiled <HI>Death's Dance;</HI> a ludicrous repre&s;entation of the univer&s;al influence of that in&s;atiable tyrant, over all ranks of men; beginning with the full-che&s;ted Cardinal, and triply coronated Pope, and leading into his mazes the Prince and Pea&s;ant: but I am &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ted with the church paintings I have &s;een in other places, that I had not patience to attend to this defilement of the tabernacle. There are &s;ome grim and lion-like Saints painted in the ailes, among whom &s;tands St John of Beverley, of hideous a&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the pavement of the cro&s;s aile are &s;everal monuments; one in|&s;cribed <HI>"Hic Jacet Thomas de Devil&s;ton,"</HI> and ornamented with a cro&s;ier; another with a cro&s;ier and chalice, in&s;cribed <HI>"Johannes Dew,"</HI> with the u&s;ual legendary prayer in the margin, <HI>Orate per anima,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a part behind the north door, is the recumbent effigy of a Knight, which Mr Wallis &s;ays repre&s;ents Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somer&s;et, taken pri&s;oner and beheaded at Hexham by King Edward the Fourth; his &s;hield <HI>Or,</HI> bearing a <HI>fe&s;&s;e az,</HI> with <HI>three garbs proper.</HI> I think it im|probable this monument was erected for a traitor, who died an ignomi|nious

death: be&s;ides, it cannot be any of the Beaufort family, as they quartered the arms of England. I rather conceive this was one of the Aydens of Ayden Ca&s;tle, the arms a&s;&s;umed by the Edens of the North at this day, being greatly &s;imilar. The male line of the family of Aydens of Ayden Ca&s;tle, was extinct in Edward the Fir&s;t's time; and Emma the heire&s;s and relict of that family, was by him, as a royal ward, given in marriage to Wallis.</P>
<P>The interior architecture of this church, is highly fini&s;hed, in the mixed Gothic order; the pillars are clu&s;tered, &s;upporting Gothic arches; the members of the archings, and the pila&s;ters, finely proportioned. The quire is roofed with wood covered with lead, and the &s;ide ailes are arched with &s;tone; a double gallery runs round the whole, opening with Saxon arches; each opening is compo&s;ed of three arches, the centre circular, the &s;ide ones pointed, of which the workman&s;hip is very fine, and the pillars light. The principal pillars of this &s;tructure in general are rather di&s;proportionate and heavy; an error &s;een in mo&s;t of the Saxon churches.</P>
<P>The Mercers Company in London, under the will of Richard Fi&s;h|born, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> about the year 1630, founded a Lecture&s;hip here, which they endowed by a purcha&s;e of tithes. Sir Walter Calverly Blackett gave &s;everal valuable gifts for the augmentation of the living; and many charities have been left for the relief of the poor. It is a doubt with me, whether the&s;e donations to the poor do not induce indigent and impotent per&s;ons to crowd a town, and in effect encourage idlene&s;s. Had the donors di&s;po&s;ed the &s;ame &s;ums for in&s;tituting and &s;upporting a manufactory, the encouragement to indu&s;try would have brought with it opulence, in&s;tead of crowds of mendicants.</P>
<P>Mr Gale and Dr Stukeley, in the year 1726, vi&s;ited the vaults of this church, now u&s;ed as a private burial-place. What will not Curio&s;ity attempt! They have given two in&s;criptions di&s;covered there; the one containing a new name of a <HI>Legatus Augu&s;ti,</HI> viz. <HI>Q. Calpurnius conce&s;&s;inius,</HI> and that of a body of hor&s;e at Corche&s;ter, called <HI>Equites Cae&s;arien&s;es</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ariani Coronotatae,</HI> not mentioned either in the <HI>Notitia Imperii</HI> or el&s;e|where. The other of <HI>Lucius Septimus Severus,</HI> by them &s;aid to be of the be&s;t &s;culpture, the letters large, but the in&s;cription imperfect.

&s;o di&s;tinctly the name of that Emperor, and its being the only genuine one found &s;o near the wall with his name on it.</P>
<P>Mr Hor&s;ley gives the fir&s;t of the&s;e in&s;criptions in the following manner:
<Q><L>LEG. A&mdash;</L>
<L>Q. CALPVRNVS</L>
<L>CONCESSINI</L>
<L>VS. PRAEF. EQ</L>

<P>To this reading he adds the following remarks:</P>
<P><Q>The Rev. Mr Andrews of Hexham, obliged a friend of mine with a copy of the &s;ame in&s;criptions, which he had taken. This in&s;crip|tion is upon a Roman altar: I had leave to de&s;cend into the vault and view the in&s;criptions. I &s;pent &s;ome time in examining every par|ticular, and have here repre&s;ented them as I found them, with the greate&s;t impartiality. Every word and letter that remains in this, is &s;o plain as to leave no room for any doubt. The not taking notice that the altar and in&s;cription are both of them imperfect at the top, is the only material defect in the former repre&s;entation. I look upon it as certain, that the letters which have filled up the deficient part of the line, have been VG. PR. PR. for thus the number of letters in this line will an&s;wer to the number in the others. I think al&s;o there have been two or three lines above, which are broken off: the&s;e have probably contained the name of the Legate, and of the God to whom the altar had been in&s;cribed. The conjectures in the letters in Mr Gordon's appendix are very ingenious, and the arguments u&s;ed in &s;upport of them, very learned and curious. The author &s;uppo&s;es, that here is the name of a new Legate, as al&s;o of a new body of hor&s;e, called <HI>Equites Cae&s;arien&s;es</HI> (or <HI>Cae&s;ariani) Corionototae:</HI> the name <HI>Equites
<PB N="101" REF="133">
Cae&s;arien&s;es,</HI> is there ju&s;tified by a parallel in&s;tance in Gruter; and the name <HI>Corionototae,</HI> that gentleman &s;uppo&s;es to be a corruption of the Roman name of a people in the&s;e parts, perhaps <HI>Curia</HI> or <HI>Coria Otodinor,</HI> and that Corbridge was the place. The re&s;t of the in&s;cription he ju|diciou&s;ly explains to be a flattering acknowledgment of this per&s;on, that he was promoted by the immediate hand of the Emperor; it be|ing no new thing to call the Emperors Gods, and erect altars to them. But in a matter &s;o entirely conjectural, it is very excu&s;able to &s;u&s;pend one's a&s;&s;ent; and the more explanations are offered, it is the more probable that the truth will be found out. If <HI>Q. Calpurnius Conce&s;&s;inius</HI> was the Imperial Legate, I &s;carce think that he would in the &s;ame in|&s;cription &s;tile him&s;elf <HI>Praefect of Hor&s;e:</HI> I rather believe, as I hinted before, that the name of the Legate has been above, and is broken off. Perhaps it has been <HI>&s;ub Legato Augu&s;tali,</HI> or <HI>pro &s;aluti Legati Au|gu&s;talis.</HI> As to the word <HI>Corionototarum,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract of a Letter from <HI>Sir John Clerk</HI> to <HI>R. Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></P>
<P><Q>As to your in&s;cription from Hexham, it is evident the artificer has been very un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that his chi&s;el has &s;tammered into more &s;yllabus than were nece&s;&s;ary in the word Corio|nototarum. I humbly think it ought to have been Coriatarum, and that the people of Cor|che&s;ter were called Coriatae, as the Spartans of old were called Spartiatae, or Spartietas, much u&s;ed by Herodotus.</Q></P></NOTE> I rather &s;uppo&s;e that Pto|lemy's <HI>Coria</HI> or <HI>Curia,</HI> was a town of the <HI>Gadeni,</HI> than of the <HI>Otadini.</HI> Ptolemy's <HI>Coritani,</HI> are a people of one of the <HI>Provinciae Cae&s;arien&s;es</HI> in Britain, and po&s;&s;ibly, from hence the&s;e hor&s;e might have the name of <HI>Cae&s;arien&s;es Coritani. Coriotiotar</HI> in the anonymous <HI>Ravenuas,</HI> is not unlike this name. I &s;uppo&s;e it may have been mi&s;taken by &s;ome tran|&s;criber for <HI>Coriotiotae</HI> or <HI>Corionototae;</HI> the &s;hape of the Gothic <HI>E</HI> is not unfavourale to this: but it &s;eems more probable to me, that it was from &s;ome more di&s;tant country, than any part of Britain, that the&s;e troops had the name of <HI>Cae&s;arien&s;es Corionototae</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;arien&s;es Corionoto|tarum.</HI> The <HI>Crotoniatae</HI> (inhabitants of <HI>Croton,</HI> a city in Greece) are celebrated by <HI>Strabo;</HI> according to whom, 'the la&s;t of the&s;e was equal to the fir&s;t of the other Greeks.' Po&s;&s;ibly this name may have been de&s;igned for <HI>Crotoniatarum:</HI> if this be admitted, we may more ea&s;ily account for the Greek in&s;criptions at Corbridge and Lanche&s;ter, and for the more evidences of Grecian Auxiliaries, that appear in the neighbourhood. The explication of the re&s;t of the in&s;cription by the &s;ame learned gentleman, whom I mentioned above, is certainly ju&s;t; that <HI>Prae&s;enti&s;&s;imum Numen dei</HI> &s;ignifies the Emperor, and <HI>manu</HI> inti|mates that <HI>Q. Calpurnius</HI> was advanced to his po&s;t by the immediate

hand of this Emperor, &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Commodus,</HI> who lea&s;t de&s;erved &s;uch titles, and yet mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on them. I find <HI>Numini Prae&s;enti</HI> in an in&s;cription to <HI>Caracalla.</HI> The word <HI>Prae&s;enti</HI> &s;eems to be u&s;ed in a different &s;en&s;e in the&s;e ca&s;es from that of Horace:

<L>Juranda&s;que tuum per Numen ponimus aras.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>And again in his Ode concerning Regulus:
<Q><L>&mdash; Prae&s;ens divus habebitur</L>
<L>Augu&s;tus adjectis Britannis</L>
<L>Imperio.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>To what particular Emperor this in&s;cription mu&s;t be referred, is hard to determine with certainty.</Q></P>
<P>Our curio&s;ity urged us, at the di&s;tance of 49 years after tho&s;e learned vi&s;iters had in&s;pected the vaults, to &s;ee the antiquities they mention: perhaps they had entered into open cells, then unu&s;ed for &s;epulture: our de&s;cent was more &s;olemn. The&s;e vaults have for &s;everal years pa&s;t been u&s;ed as a private burial-place, and the entrance is covered with a table of marble, of prodigious &s;ize, which is not u&s;ually moved but at the denunciation of mortality. The ma&s;&s;ive <HI>Clau&s;trum</HI> was heaved from the mouth of the vault by iron crows and rollers, at which the ground trembled over the arches&mdash;by a ladder we de&s;cended about 20 feet, into the regions of the dead, where avaricious curio&s;ity making an anxious re&s;earch after the objects of its de&s;ire, &s;o compleatly occupied the mind, that &s;carce one reflection was agitated, for tho&s;e, over who&s;e a&s;hes we wantonly trampled. The&s;e vaults, which anciently were within the we&s;t end of the cro&s;s, have been built of the &s;tones of a Roman &s;tation, many cornices, mouldings, and ornaments, with fragments of in&s;crip|tions, are &s;cattered through the walls. We found the preceding in|&s;cription corre&s;pond exactly with the plate in Mr Hor&s;ley's works. The narrow vault, on the left hand, is roofed over with flat &s;tones, on the furthe&s;t of which the following in&s;cription is pre&s;erved, but from its &s;ituation, and the &s;tone being rever&s;ed, rendered difficult to be read. My companion and I took it with great attention, both in the letters as rever&s;ed, and (as well as we could &s;ee them) direct. Our copies exactly corre&s;ponded with each other, and yet they differ from Mr Hor&s;ley's, in who&s;e plates it is thus repre&s;ented:

<P>To this reading he adds, <Q>There can be no great doubt, with relation to the former part of it, which is not unlike the in&s;cription at Burgh, in Richmond&s;hire; a copy of which was long ago publi&s;hed by Mr Camden, and runs thus: Imperatori Cae&s;ari Marco Antonino Pio Aurelio Felici Augu&s;to, &amp;c. Then follows a &s;pace where the name of Geta has been era&s;ed. Ju&s;t &s;o in this in&s;cription at Hexham; after much the &s;ame names and titles given to Severus and Caracalla, there fol|lows a &s;mall &s;pace, where it is manife&s;t the words have been de&s;ign|edly era&s;ed with a tool. I &s;uppo&s;e the Vexillatio Legionis was made up of the &s;everal Vexillations of the particular Cohorts: and perhaps they might retain the name of Vexillationes Cohortium, when the Vexillations of all the Cohorts of the Legion, that is, the whole Vex|illation of the Legion it&s;elf was not pre&s;ent. The&s;e then might be the Vexillations of &s;ome Cohorts of one of the Legions which were employed in building the wall, that might be occa&s;ionally at Hex|ham, and erect this in&s;cription. Some of the in&s;cription, facing the right hand, is covered in the wall, on which the in&s;cribed &s;tone re&s;ts. The lower part of the &s;tone is al&s;o fixed in the end wall of one of the pa&s;&s;ages into the vault; but not &s;o as to hinder the lowe&s;t line from being read, though not without difficulty. The letters FE&mdash;RVNT are di&s;tinct and certain, and as much room is between the E and R, as will contain CE: &s;o that beyond all que&s;tion it has been fecerunt, which compleats the in&s;cription. The &s;tone has had a rai&s;ed bordering, which was &s;poiled, and made level with the re&s;t of the &s;tone, when it was built up in this place.</Q></P>
<P>It is with the utmo&s;t diffidence I offer to the public remarks upon this in&s;cription, where they do not agree with the very learned Anti|quaries

<P>An in&s;cription in the Cottonian collection, found at Bowes, in York|&s;hire, mentions the Vettones as follows:

<P>Before I quit the &s;ubject of the&s;e in&s;criptions, I mu&s;t add, that Mr Hor&s;ley &s;ays <Q>the&s;e &s;tones and in&s;criptions argue Hexham to have been a Roman Station; for the plenty of free &s;tone &s;o near, makes it im|probable that in the modern buildings (or tho&s;e later than Roman) they would have fetched any &s;tones either from the Roman Wall or from Corbridge. And this might have been a town in the Roman times, and yet not be mentioned in the Itinerary, nor continue &s;o late as

The &s;ituation of this does by no means an&s;wer, but it is plain from Vinovium and Galatum, that Ptolemy is here in confu&s;ion; and the mutual di&s;|tances between the&s;e three places, are not &s;o far wrong as their &s;i|tuation.</Q></P>

<P>At the we&s;t end of the church are the remains of the priory. It was a &s;pacious building, with an adjoining cloi&s;ter. The refectory is yet entire, and &s;erves as a room of entertainment at public times; is very &s;pacious, with a roof of oak work. What remains of the cloi&s;ters, &s;hews they were of excellent workman&s;hip: the tabernacle work and pila&s;ters above the &s;eats are elegant: the door ca&s;e oppo&s;ite, which formerly was an entrance into the church, is richly wrought with pierced work of fruit and foliage, in a &s;tile ea&s;y and bold.</P>
<P>The town of Hexham was burnt by the Scots in the year 1296, to|gether with the priory, the we&s;t end of the church, and &s;chool-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was pillaged by David King of Scots, in the 20th year of the reign of King Edward III. A. D. 1346, who entered the borders with 40,000 men, making their way by Lanerco&s;t Priory and Nawarth Ca&s;tle, in Cumberland; on which incur&s;ion they were over thrown at Nevil's Cro&s;s, near Durham, and David was taken pri&s;oner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Jo.

<P>This place is not very populous, the inhabitants being computed at 2000 &s;ouls: the &s;treets are narrow, and ill built. The Market-place, near the centre of the town, is a &s;pacious &s;quare; in which is a conve|nient piazza for the butcher-meat, the &s;talls being moveable. The town is &s;upplied by a fluent fountain of water, in the Market-place. Two markets are held here in the week, on Thur&s;day and Saturday; and there are two annual fairs.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="138">Leading to the priory, is a gate-way of very ancient architecture; the arches form a &s;emicircle, and are moulded in a &s;tile which denotes their antiquity to be much greater than any part of the priory or ca|thedral. There is nothing &s;imilar to this work, in proportion of mem|bers, about the church, or any thing in Hexham I could di&s;cover that appeared cotemporary. The roof of the gate-way is of ribbed arching, meeting in the centre; the inter&s;tices, filled with thin &s;tones or bricks, &s;uch as are &s;een in Roman works. The pa&s;&s;age is divided into a large gate-way for hor&s;emen or carriages, and a narrow one for foot pa&s;&s;en|gers. The &s;uper&s;tructure is in ruins. Mr Pennant &s;ays this gate <Q>is of the old Saxon architecture, and perhaps part of the labours of the great Wilfrid.</Q></P>
<P>There are two ancient towers in the town, the one u&s;ed as a Court or Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, anciently an exploratory tower, belonging to the Bi&s;hops and Priors of Hexham; the other &s;ituated on the top of the hill towards the Tyne, of remarkable architecture; being &s;quare, containing very &s;mall apertures to admit the light, and having a cour&s;e of corbels pro|jecting a long way from the top, which &s;eem to have &s;upported a hang|ing gallery, and be&s;peak the tower, at pre&s;ent, not near its original height. The founders of the&s;e places are not known. Camden &s;ays "he heard they appertained to the Archbi&s;hop of York." This la&s;t-mentioned tower, having two dreadful dungeons within it, doubtle&s;s has been the chief fortre&s;s of the place, and was u&s;ed as a pri&s;on when the Bi&s;hops of Hexham po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their palatine juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>In one of the chambers remaining in this tower, is the in&s;cription on the plate. Mr Bailey, who was my companion, was informed of it on a late vi&s;it to Hexham, and did me the favour to communicate it. He de&s;cribes it as cut with a knife on the oak lintle of the chimney, which remains rough and uneven. The room is of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, but appears to have had no windows, or any lights but what was re|ceived through loop-holes in the walls. The Gaoler now u&s;es the apart|ment for a hay-loft. The in&s;cription &s;eems to be the labour of &s;ome Scotch pri&s;oner, and by the character is of no very di&s;tant antiquity. By the two letters at the beginning of the in&s;cription, I apprehend it was done in the reign of one of the James's; and give it the greate&s;t antiquity, under the Scotch royal line of that name, it will only carry it to the beginning of the 13th century.

<P>This place has owned &s;everal learned men: John de Hexham and Richard de Hexham, both Superiors of this religious hou&s;e, and great Hi&s;torians. The Addenda to the book of Symeon of Durham, from the 9th of King Henry II. to the 1&s;t of King Richard, we owe to Prior John.

<P>There is a School here founded by Queen Elizabeth, 25th June, 1599, with an ample &s;tipend for a Ma&s;ter and U&s;her. The Ma&s;ter's hou&s;e was built by &s;ub&s;cription.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1713 a &s;mall pamphlet was publi&s;hed by Mr Rit&s;chel, Mini&s;ter of Hexham, containing an account of the charities and benefactors to the churches, poor, and free &s;chools in Tyndale ward, to which is added a brief account and de&s;cription of the pari&s;h and pari&s;h church of Hex|ham, with an ab&s;tract of Queen Elizabeth's patent for the free &s;chool, and the &s;tatutes thereof.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Market-place, on the front of an old hou&s;e, are three coats of armour, in plai&s;ter-work: opinions are various what they denominate: the mo&s;t probable is, that the dexter arms is that of the Dean and Chap|ter of York; the centre, the cro&s;s of St Andrew, to whom the church was dedicated; and the &s;ini&s;ter one, being one of the <HI>Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cantantia,</HI> or Rebu&s;&s;es, anciently adopted, comprehends the name of &s;ome great churchman.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to procure you what you mention in your la&s;t to me, out of the <HI>Aliena|tion Office,</HI> as &s;oon as I can, and tran&s;mit it to you. Among the books you tell me you are ma&s;ter of, I find <HI>Doom&s;day</HI> to be one: pray let me know what it is you have of that, for I cannot think it is an entire copy of what is lodged in the Exchequer, though I could heartily with it were; as al&s;o what you call <HI>Bede's Albinus Anglus,</HI> for I do not remember any thing among Bede's works under that title. The MS. volume of <HI>Leland</HI> in my &s;tudy touches a little upon the North Riding of York&s;hire, but, I fear, will be of little &s;ervice to you: he treats of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain in another of the printed volumes; but what he gives you of it is there al&s;o very thin and trivial I have ordered a copy of my <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to be tran&s;cribed here by the printed one, with &s;ome corrections I have made to it, and &s;hall &s;end it you by the next return of <HI>Mr P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing,</HI> and hope it may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you. You will find in it, that I have taken notice of five great Ways in&s;tead of four, according to the general account of our Hi&s;torians who only copied from one another, and have pointed out their &s;everal cour&s;es more exactly than has been done by any body el&s;e. The rea&s;on they have given you an account but of four, I take to be their notion that there were no more of them which can cro&s;s the i&s;land from &s;ea to &s;ea, and that, I believe, is true; but that there were others in great numbers is unque&s;tion|able. The great Way you mention that comes from <HI>Dunbritton Frith</HI> to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Nor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and,</HI> falls into, or may be a continuation of the <HI>Ermin &s;treet,</HI> which you will find in the E&s;&s;ay. I have traced from <HI>Arundell,</HI> in <HI>Suffex,</HI> to <HI>Gatherley Moor,</HI> in your neighbourhood, and there followed two branches of it, one to <HI>Carli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le,</HI> and the other to <HI>Tynmouth;</HI> but I
<PB N="113" REF="146">was wholly ignorant of this third di&s;covered &s;ince by you. I &s;hall not here give you the rea&s;ons why this is the <HI>Ermin-&s;treet,</HI> but refer you to the E&s;&s;ay for them, and in the mean time only further add, that the <HI>Watling &s;treet</HI> is the trulie&s;t de&s;cribed by <HI>Higden</HI> of any of them; but it did not terminate at <HI>Cardigan,</HI> as he &s;ays, but at <HI>We&s;t Che&s;ter,</HI> and that the cour&s;e of it is very vi&s;ible almo&s;t every where that he mentions it, and that I have my&s;elf, one time or other, travelled upon the greate&s;t part of it, and found it &s;eldom or never lo&s;es its name. I fancy, the country people calling that which you &s;u&s;pect to be the <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> in <HI>Northumberland</HI> by that name, has been the chief motive for your opinion; but I could give you &s;everal in|&s;tances of old Ways &s;ometimes called <HI>Watling-&s;treet,</HI> and &s;ometimes the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e Way</HI> by the vulgar, in counties where it is certain tho&s;e Ways never came; &s;o that nothing is to be built upon that.</P>
<P><HI>Antoninus's</HI> &s;econd journey, indeed, takes in the whole length of it, but not till it falls into it at <HI>Deva</HI> or <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The Roman Station at <HI>Ethelburgh</HI> is taken notice of by <HI>Camden,</HI> who makes it more than probable, from an in&s;cription there dug up, that it was called <HI>Bruchium.</HI> To confirm this opinion. I will give you a conjecture of mine, taken from the <HI>Mona&s;ticon Anglicanum,</HI> vol. I. p. 178, where, in an old deed, this very place is named <HI>Enthelbert,</HI> as I believe, from <HI>Enchelberi,</HI> the word <HI>Enchel</HI> in <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> &s;ignifying an <HI>Arm, brachium,</HI> the very name in Latin and Briti&s;h thus corre&s;ponding. Be&s;ides, I cannot but be of opinion, that <HI>Brementonacis</HI> was at <HI>Overborough,</HI> on the edge of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> it lying in the direct way be|tween <HI>Gallacum, Whellop Ca&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>Coccium, Ribbleche&s;ter,</HI> from which latter place it keeps the ju&s;t di&s;tance allotted it by <HI>Antoninus;</HI> and tho' the copies of that <HI>Itinerary</HI> place it 27 from the former, in&s;tead of 32 miles; upon a little con&s;ideration, you will find the mi&s;take might be ea&s;ily occa&s;ioned, by the tran&s;cribers turning the third X into V. I do not know whether you have &s;een the edition of <HI>Antoninus</HI> publi&s;hed by me &s;ome years ago; if you have not, my brother, at <HI>Scruton,</HI> can lend it you; it may, perhaps, be diverting to you, though I mu&s;t own I have, &s;ince the publication of it, found rea&s;on to make &s;everal alterations in it, as I have done upon my own book that I have here by me; and among others, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge it, that your Map has fully convinced me, that <HI>Glanoventa</HI> and <HI>Gallana,</HI> in the <HI>tenth Itinerary,</HI> are at <HI>Thornton</HI> and <HI>Portgate,</HI> and not where my unacquaintedne&s;s with the coun|try had induced me to place them; but <HI>Alone,</HI> I take to be <HI>Whitley Ca&s;tle,</HI> in <HI>Alondale,</HI> as well from the better agreement of the miles, as from an in&s;cription there left by the <HI>Cohors Tertia Nerviorum,</HI> which the <HI>Notitia Imperii</HI> quarters at <HI>Alone.</HI> I am pretty much of your mind, that the military way from <HI>Ea&s;ingwould</HI> to <HI>Thir&s;t,</HI> came from <HI>York</HI> towards <HI>Caturactonium,</HI> or rather into that which went from <HI>Caturactonium</HI> towards <HI>Gatherley Moor,</HI> becau&s;e I am very much mi&s;taken, if there is not a military way running along the northern bank of <HI>Swale,</HI> from <HI>Catterick Bridge</HI> ea&s;tward towards <HI>Bolton.</HI> Now I take the cour&s;e of this road to have gone by <HI>Thornton in the Street</HI> to <HI>Thornbrough,</HI> and by <HI>Romandby,</HI> near <HI>Northallerton,</HI> which I doubt not has been a Roman Station, by the name of it; and you will find great works ca&s;t up about the <HI>Ca&s;tle Hills</HI> there, which are very evidently far larger and beyond the con|fines of the modern ca&s;tle. I have al&s;o been told of a Roman Way &s;ome where about <HI>Ro|mandby,</HI> though I could never well under&s;tand where it was. To this I &s;hall add, that I hardly ever met with a place named <HI>Thornbrough</HI> or <HI>Thornton,</HI> that was not near &s;ome old Station; &s;uch a one you have by <HI>Catterick;</HI> another, called <HI>Thornton</HI> and <HI>Thornaldby,</HI> near <HI>Ethelbury; Thornton,</HI> where <HI>Glanoventa</HI> &s;tood, in <HI>Northumberland; Thornbrough,</HI> near <HI>No&s;tre|field Moor,</HI> and ju&s;t by the <HI>Via Vicinalis</HI> that led from <HI>Ethelbury</HI> over that Moor into <HI>Leeming|lane,</HI> (part of the <HI>Ermin-&s;treet</HI>) and not far from <HI>Well,</HI> where any of the inhabitants can &s;hew

The military way, or <HI>Via Vicinalis,</HI> mentioned on the other &s;ide to come from <HI>Ethelbury,</HI> runs very near the&s;e intrenchments, and falls into <HI>Leeming|lane</HI> not far from <HI>Wath,</HI> and I think another ancient way &s;eems to cro&s;s the road between <HI>Exelby</HI> and <HI>Cathorp,</HI> towards the &s;ame line.

<P>I have read your E&s;&s;ay <NOTE N="*">Printed in the 6th Vol. of Leland, Itinerary, pub|li&s;hed by Mr Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, at Oxford, 171<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, p 53.</NOTE> towards recovery of the four great Roman Ways over and over, with greater plea&s;ure than I ever read any thing in my life; I am fully convinced, that the cour&s;es you have taken for tho&s;e ancient roads are perfectly right, excepting that you loo&s;e the &s;tem of the Ermin|&s;treet upon Gatherley Moor, and follow only two branches of it, that go directly to <HI>Tinmonth</HI> and <HI>Boulne&s;&s;e,</HI> the two extremes of the Picts Wall, whil&s;t the main &s;treet proceeds northward, almo&s;t in a &s;traight line, and an uninter|rupted ridge from Piercebridge clo&s;e by a &s;mall village called <HI>Denton,</HI> where there are many

From this place its cour&s;e is generally over moori&s;h grounds to <HI>Langche&s;ter,</HI> where mo&s;t of tho&s;e altars and in|&s;criptions in Durham Library were found;<NOTE>See Philo&s;.

<P>But before I leave <HI>Ebche&s;ter,</HI> which is inferior to no place I have mentioned for Antiquities, I cannot but acquaint you, that I look upon it to have been the <HI>Vindomora</HI> of <HI>Antoninus,</HI> and not <HI>Wall's End,</HI> where that Station hath hitherto been fixed, &s;ince it exactly an&s;wers the di&s;|tances between <HI>Cor&s;topitum</HI> and <HI>Vinovium,</HI> the &s;econd and fourth Stations in the fir&s;t Iter.

<PB N="118" REF="151">upon it, between <HI>Old Town</HI> and <HI>Ethelburgh,</HI> at a due di&s;tance from them both, according to the <HI>Itinerary,</HI> it would put the matter out of di&s;pute; but I cannot think of any &s;uch, and if it pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Teys</HI> at <HI>Statford,</HI> as there &s;eems to be no great doubt it did, it points a little too much ea&s;tward for <HI>Alone</HI> (Old Town) and rather inclines to fall into the great Roman road at or near to <HI>Vinonium</HI> (Binche&s;ter). I have been very long upon this &s;ubject, therefore &s;hall only add, that the miles I reckon by are &s;horter than tho&s;e you make your computation from; for as <HI>Antoninus</HI> is my chief guide. I make an allowance for the difference between the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> which is as 972 to 1000. I do not know whether I mentioned the Roman road from <HI>Romanby,</HI> &amp;c. running by <HI>Bolton,</HI> on the north &s;ide of <HI>Swale,</HI> to you, but I find you have ob&s;erved it. If you have lei&s;ure at any time, when you are at <HI>Northallerton,</HI> to view the <HI>Ca&s;tle Hills</HI> there, between that <HI>town</HI> and <HI>Romanby,</HI> you will find great works and trenches out of the limits, and beyond the ditch of the <HI>modern Ca&s;tle,</HI> we&s;tward and &s;outhward, which I dare &s;ay were Roman, and gave name to the neighbouring village, though what was the an|cient appellation of it, is now entirely lo&s;t. As for the name of <HI>Allerton,</HI> it is very hard to tell whence it came; the <HI>Saxon Kings</HI> generally built on or near the ruins of ancient and decayed <HI>Roman towns,</HI> and as we have no memorials that contradict my conjecture. I am apt to think this town might be built here by <HI>King Alfred,</HI> who re&s;tored many places that had been de|&s;troyed by the <HI>Danes;</HI> or el&s;e by <HI>Guthrum the Dane,</HI> to whom, upon his being baptized, he gave all the kingdom on the north &s;ide of <HI>Watling-&s;treet,</HI> who might call it <HI>Alvertun</HI> or <HI>Al|&s;reton</HI> (for that is the anciente&s;t name it occurs by) in honour of his godfather and benefactor: this, I think, is more probable, than that it &s;hould be &s;o called from <HI>aller trees,</HI> as &s;ome have fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cied, &s;ince the ancient writing of the name makes for it.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your kind offer of your <HI>Coins,</HI> but I am unwilling to rob you of them, having mo&s;t of them already; as for the <HI>Altar</HI> found at <HI>El&s;don,</HI> I &s;hould be very thankful for that, and de&s;ire you, when opportunity &s;erves, to get it conveyed to <HI>Scru|ton</HI> where I hope to &s;ee it next &s;ummer, but the carriage mu&s;t be at my charge. The cir|cum&s;tances of your finding the altar at <HI>Che&s;ter in the Wood,</HI> are very odd; I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that vault to have been the place where the altar was primarily erected and u&s;ed, &s;ince they only &s;acrificed under ground to the <HI>infernal Gods,</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> was not one of them: it &s;eems, mo&s;t probably, to have been concealed there by the <HI>Romans,</HI> or <HI>Roman Britons,</HI> when they were drove from tho&s;e Stations by the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts,</HI> to prevent its profanation by tho&s;e barbarous enemies, and that other which accompanied it, may have been accidentally broken in the burying; but then as to the &s;moaky &s;mell, it will be a little difficult to form any conjecture. I was once at <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rence&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Cloce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> &s;hewn the top of much &s;uch a vault, as you de|&s;cribe, in a garden there, but the ground all over and about it being &s;own, I could not per|&s;uade the Gardener to give me admittance into it, but he a&s;&s;ured me it was filled near three feet deep with burnt bones and a&s;hes; this made me conclude &s;ome altar might have &s;tood near it, and that this vault was the receptacle of what was &s;wept from the altar; and why may not the vault at <HI>Che&s;ter in the Wood</HI> have been for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and thence con|tracted its &s;mell? I think you were much in the right not to part with it and the re&s;t to the Lord you mention upon general promi&s;es: I dare &s;ay all the gratification you would have had from him, would have been the honour done you, of erecting marble pede&s;tals to &s;et them on.</P>

<P>This abbey was founded by Walter de Bolbeck in 1175, dedicated to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, for twelve Premon&s;traten&s;ian Canons, having li|berty to exceed that number, with the con&s;ent of the Bi&s;hop of Durham. Part of his donation was twelve fi&s;hes for their table, out of his fi&s;hery of Stiford, in lieu of tithes of fi&s;h. The Abbot was &s;ummoned to par|liament 23 King Edward I. At the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, here were fourteen Canons; the annual revenue of the hou&s;e, according to Dugdale, being 40l. 0s. 9d. and 44l. 9s. 1d. according to Speed. After pa&s;&s;ing from the Crown by &s;ale, it became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fo&s;ters, and was for|feited in 1715, by Thomas For&s;ter, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> after which it was purcha&s;ed by Lord Crew, and by him left to charitable u&s;es.</P>
<P>The we&s;t end and tower of the church and the &s;outh aile of the cro&s;s remain; the latter neatly fitted up for parochial duty. The gate|way entering into the &s;quare, where formerly the hou&s;es of the Canons &s;tood, &s;till remains; the towers on each hand converted into ale-hou&s;es: the buildings which are &s;tanding are now inhabited by poor people, who are perhaps employed in the leadworks; the di&s;tre&s;s and ragged appearance of the whole conventual buildings, being mo&s;t deplorable; no one relique of church pomp remaining. To compen&s;ate for the di&s;|agreeable review of cells of poverty, we walked in the levels adjoining the church, when it happened to be the time of divine &s;ervice: the p&s;alm of the congregation, at our di&s;tance, had a degree of &s;olemn har|mony, which in&s;pired &s;erious though plea&s;ing reflections: &s;entiments and ideas &s;ucceeded, which dignify the mind of man, and give him competition with angels.</P>

It is guarded by an outward wall towards the Tyne, built on the brink of the cliffs, in this part not le&s;s than &s;ixty perpendicular feet in height, above the plain which intervenes between the ca&s;tle and the river; this wall at inter|vals is defended by &s;quare ba&s;tions. The entrance to the ca&s;tle is from the &s;outh: on our approach the whole &s;tructure was viewed from the heights, and made a very noble and formidable appearance. The nar|row neck of land leading to the entrance, was formerly cut through by

a deep ditch, over which a draw bridge has given acce&s;s to the out|ward gate: the water which anciently &s;upplied the ditch, is now col|lected by a re&s;ervoir before the gate, and &s;erves a mill: the outward gate was originally defended by &s;everal outworks and a tower, as ap|pears by their ruins. From the &s;ituation in which I drew my view of this place, I could overlook the top of the fir&s;t gate, and the eye pene|trated the inner gate-way, the &s;uper&s;tructure of which is a lofty em|battled &s;quare tower, about &s;ixty feet high, now &s;o mantled with ivy, that the windows, loop-holes, and apertures are almo&s;t wholly con|cealed.

<P>In the 14th of King John, Richard de Umfrevill delivered up his four &s;ons and his ca&s;tle of Brudhow, as pledges for his fidelity; notwith&s;tanding which he put him&s;elf in arms among the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, in the 17th of the &s;ame reign. The con&s;equence of which was, that the ca&s;tle and lands were given to Hugh de Baliol. But in the reign of Henry III. he obtained a re&s;titution, but never had the confidence of that King, who was offended at and di&s;tru&s;ted him on account of his fortifying his ca&s;tle of Harbottle. He gave one toft and eight acres of land in the town of Prudhow to the Monks of Hexham. His &s;on Gilbert &s;ucceeded to this Barony, and dying the 30th of Henry III. was &s;ucceeded by</P>
<P>Gilbert the &s;econd, who was &s;tiled the famous Baron, the Flower and Keeper of the northern parts of England.</P>
<P>Gilbert the third was by King Edward I. made Earl of Angus in Scotland, and under that title &s;ummoned to parliament, A.D. 1297. The Lawers at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to acknowledge him as an Earl, becau&s;e Angus was not of this kingdom; but &s;ubmitted on &s;ight of the King's writ, wherein he was &s;ummoned by that title.</P>
<P>Gilbert the fourth, in the 25th of Edward III. exhibited a petition to the King and his Council a&s;&s;embled in parliament, &s;etting forth, that he and his ance&s;tors, time out of mind, u&s;ed to have cu&s;tody of all pri&s;oners taken within the liberty of Reed&s;dale, to be kept in his pri&s;on of Harbottle Ca&s;tle: which being &s;o ruined by the Scots wars, that it was in&s;ufficient to retain them, he de&s;ired he might have leave to keep all &s;uch pri&s;oners in his Ca&s;tle of Prudhow, till his Ca&s;tle of Harbottle could be properly repaired. The King being &s;atisfied that the fact al|ledged in his petition was true, and con&s;idering that the ruinous &s;tate of Harbottle Ca&s;tle did not ari&s;e from neglect, granted him leave to keep &s;uch pri&s;oners in his ca&s;tle of Prudhoe for ten years.</P>
<P>This Earl Gilbert died without i&s;&s;ue in 1381, having had by his wife Maude, daughter and heir of Thomas Lord Lucy, a &s;on named Robert, who, although he died before his father, had been married to Margaret daughter of Henry the &s;econd Lord Percy of Alnwick, but with|out i&s;&s;ue. It &s;eems to have been in con&s;equence of the &s;ettlement made on this marriage, that the Ca&s;tle and Barony of Prudhow de&s;cended to the Percies; for it appears among the pleas in the King's Bench, 15 King Henry VI. and Rol. 9. on a traver&s;e then tendered by Henry Earl of Northumberland, <Q>that John Hawborough and John Pykeworth, A^o. 49 King Edward III. gave to Gilbert Hamfervile, and to Mawde his wife, and to their heirs lawfully begotten, the &s;aid Ca&s;tle and Barony, and the Manor of Ovingham; and for lack of &s;uch i&s;&s;ue, the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, Manor, and Barony to remain to Henry Lord Percy, and to his heirs for ever.</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;po&s;ition, after the death of Earl Gilbert his widow the Counte&s;s Maude enjoyed it for her life. She married to her &s;econd hu&s;band Henry Percy, fir&s;t Earl of Northumberland, who after her death entered into full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle and Barony, with its appendages, and the &s;ame continued in his po&s;terity, without any other interruption except what was occa&s;ioned by the attenders in different periods. Thus on the forfeiture of the &s;aid fir&s;t Earl of Northumberland and his &s;on Hot&s;pur, in the reign of King Henry IV. the Ca&s;tle and Lord&s;hip of Prudhow were be&s;towed by the &s;aid King (6 King Henry IV.) on his &s;on John, afterwards Duke of Bedford and Regent of France, who appears to have held them till his death, except for a &s;hort time, viz. 4 Henry VI. when Ralph Earl of We&s;tmoreland was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Mano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Prudhow.

The Ca&s;tle of Prudhow was given to Sir William Bertram, Knt. in the 5th year of that King's reign. After the re&s;toration of Henry the fourth Earl of Northumberland, this Ca&s;tle and Barony were again given back to the Percies: and though their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it &s;uf|fered again &s;ome &s;hort interruptions from future attaintures, in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, yet the Ca&s;tle and Barony of Prudhow have con&s;tantly de&s;cended, with their other great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, through the &s;ucceeding Earls of Northumberland, down to their illu&s;trious repre&s;entatives the pre&s;ent Duke and his late Duche&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>RUTCHESTER,</HEAD>
<P>the Vindobala, according to Mr Hor&s;ley, of the Romans; where the Cohors Prima Frixagorum kept garri&s;on. Camden calls it Vindolana; and by &s;ome authors it is &s;aid to be the frontier &s;tation of the fourth Cohort of the Gauls. Severus's wall runs upon the middle of the ea&s;t rampart, but is not continued through the &s;tation: Hadrian's Vallum pa&s;&s;es about the di&s;tance of a chain to the &s;outh of it. This fort has been very con&s;iderable, and the ruins of it at pre&s;ent are remarkable: on the north &s;ide there have been &s;ix turrets, one at each corner, one on each &s;ide the gate, and one between each corner, and tho&s;e adjoining to the gate. On the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides there is al&s;o a tower between the gate and the angle, in that part of the fort that is on the north of the wall; but it is doubtful whether there has been the &s;ame number of towers in that part that lays within the wall. The ramparts are &s;till very vi&s;ible. If there has been a town without, which there can &s;carce be any doubt of, it has been, as u&s;ual, on the &s;outh, where the village of Rutche&s;ter now &s;tands, and covers its ruins.</P>
<P>To the north-we&s;t of Rutche&s;ter, is a place called Whitche&s;ter, &s;ome|times Outche&s;ter; in Camden it is called Old Winche&s;ter, or Vindolana,
<PB N="129" REF="162">
and there are &s;aid to be &s;ome remains of a fort here; but all this &s;eems to be a mi&s;take. There is &s;omewhat like the remains of an earthen rampart, which added to the name, may make it probable that here were the Ca&s;tra Ae&s;tiva of the garri&s;on of Rutche&s;ter; and perhaps it was called the Outer Che&s;ters.</P>
<P>Between Whitche&s;ter and Harlow Hill, is a round hill with a trench about it, which &s;eems to have been exploratory, and by the &s;ituation one would judge it had been as ancient as the time of the Romans.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve the pa&s;&s;age of Hadrian's ditch near Harlow Hill, where it pa&s;&s;es through a lime&s;tone quarry; though nothing is to be di&s;cerned on the &s;urface, yet below it the exact dimen&s;ions of the ditch may be taken; becau&s;e that part of the quarry, through which the ditch has been carried on, is now filled up with earth only, &s;o that the &s;hape and mea&s;ure here are very plain. It is made &s;loping, the depth between eight and nine feet, and about eleven feet broad. At this place a Ca&s;tellum has &s;tood; the foundations yet appear. It has had a high &s;ituation, and commanded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual di&s;tance from Harlow Hill, a Ca&s;tellum is vi&s;ible, and about a furlong we&s;t from this, the walls approach very near to each other, being not above a chain di&s;tance. Again, at the u&s;ual di&s;tance, another Ca&s;tellum appears, but &s;omewhat ob&s;cure, and of an uncommon &s;hape; two of the &s;ides (tho&s;e which lay ea&s;t and we&s;t) being about double the u&s;ual length, and the &s;outh &s;ide of it reaches very near the north Agger of Hadrian's work. Mr Hor&s;ley was of opinion this was one of Hadrian's exploratory Ca&s;tella; but the north &s;ide of it falling in exactly with the line of Severus's wall, it has been u&s;ed al&s;o as a Ca&s;|tellum by him. Severus's wall, in part of this tract, has four cour&s;es of the original &s;tone appearing.</P>
<P>From Rutche&s;ter to Halton Che&s;ters is little more than &s;even mea|&s;ured miles: there are nine Ca&s;tella between the&s;e two &s;tations, and all of them vi&s;ible, the interval between every two of them being near upon &s;ix furlongs and an half; and it is remarkable, that as the interval be|tween the&s;e two &s;tations is the greate&s;t of any upon the whole line of the wall, &s;o the intervals between the Ca&s;tella are the lea&s;t of any, ex|cept in one &s;ingle in&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="163">Many Roman Antiquities have been gained here, be&s;ides tho&s;e men|tioned by Mr Hor&s;ley, viz. an Effigy of Hercules &s;ome years ago was removed from hence by Mr Duane; two Fibulae of &s;ilver, Roman Bricks marked LVIV, and Coins of the low Empire, were lately di&s;covered; but the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition gained from hence, was an Urn found in 1766, containing gold and &s;ilver Coins, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the late William Archdeacon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in which, it is &s;aid, is a compleat &s;eries of tho&s;e of the higher Empire.

<P>The reader hitherto has only had my di&s;tant view from Hedley Hill.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="164">I cannot forbear taking notice of a public grievance, which is &s;o very notorious in the county of Northumberland, that every traveller expe|riences it. When I entered this county, I was prejudiced in its favour, and had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion that any matter nece&s;&s;ary for the public weal could be neglected. The re&s;olutions of the Magi&s;trates given to the public, will tran&s;mit their virtues to po&s;terity. Merchandize has occa&s;ioned, within the la&s;t century, &s;uch an influx of wealth to this county, that it proves Trade is advanced by good roads for carriages, and an ea&s;y communication with the ports:&mdash;how then, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch profe&s;&s;ed virtues, and &s;uch public conviction, can it ari&s;e, that the plain directions of the law, touching the highways, are totally ne|glected or overlooked? There is &s;carce one Guide-po&s;t, to mitigate the grievances of travelling, erected through the whole county, except in the neighbourhood of Wallington; and &s;ome of tho&s;e are obliterated. On the public road from Newca&s;tle to Hexham, and on the wilds of Wooler, the traveller is equally embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As you look upon Bywell from the mo&s;t plea&s;ing point of view, the land&s;kip lays in the following order:&mdash;From the road near the brink of the river, the ruined piers of a bridge become the front ob|jects; behind which, in a regular ca&s;cade, the whole river falls over a wear, extended from Bank to Bank, in height about eight perpendi|cular feet; a mill on the right hand, a &s;almon lock on the left: the town and two churches &s;tretch along the banks of the upper ba&s;on of the river, with a fine curvature: the &s;olemn ruins of the ancient ca&s;tle of the Baliols, lift their towers above the trees on the right, and make an agreeable contra&s;t with the adjoining man&s;ion-hou&s;e: the whole back ground of the land&s;kip appears covered with wood.</P>
<P>There is a tradition, that two &s;i&s;ters quarrelling about precedency, one of them founded a church of her own, from whence &s;he excluded her &s;i&s;ter; which was the occa&s;ion of two churches in this &s;mall town. Both are &s;erved at pre&s;ent by one Clergyman, who does duty in the morning at one, and in the evening at the other.</P>

<P><Q>Bywell and Bolbeck are two ancient Baronies, and are &s;ituate on the extream &s;outh part of Northumberland. To the Barony of Bywell belongeth a fore&s;t of red deer. Within the barony are many gentlemen and freeholders, who hold their lands of the &s;aid barony by &s;er|vices, and are always attendants upon the Lords in time of &s;ervice, when they &s;hall be thereto commanded.</Q> In the wa&s;tes are divers woods, and very fair cour&s;ing with greyhounds.</P>
<P><Q>The town of Bywell is builded in length all of one &s;treet, upon the river or water of Tyne, is divided into two &s;everal pari&s;hes, and inhabited by handicraftmen, who&s;e trade is in iron-work, for the hor&s;emen and borderers of that country. They are &s;ubject to the incur&s;ions of the thieves of Tynedale, and compelled winter and &s;ummer to bring all their cattle and &s;heep into the &s;treet in the night &s;ea&s;on, and watch both ends of the &s;treet, and when the enemy approacheth, to rai&s;e hue and cry.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To the barony there belongeth a fi&s;hery of &s;almon in the river Tyne, three miles in length, with a dam or bay over the river for pre&s;erving the fi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In Bywell town the ance&s;tors of the Earl of We&s;tmoreland built a fair tower or gatehou&s;e, all of &s;tone, and covered with lead; meaning to have proceeded further, as appears by the walls, the height of a man, left unfini&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Barony of Bywell comprehendeth Bywell St Peter, Bywell St Andrew, Acomb, New|ton, Ovington, Mickley, Bromley, Newlands, Ridley, Nova, Styford, Sheryden, and Ea&s;ing-hope, inhabited by men of good &s;ervice, and have very good farms, and able to keep much cattle, and get plenty of corn and hay, were it not for the continual robberies and incur&s;ions of the thieves of Tynedale, which &s;o continually a&s;&s;ault them in the night, as they can keep no more cattle than they are able to lodge either in hou&s;e or like &s;afety in the night</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Lord of the &s;aid Baronies hath the leet, within all the limits of the &s;ame, and all waives, e&s;trays, fellons goods, and amerciaments, and all other royalties, ca&s;ualties, and profits ari&s;ing or growing by rea&s;on of the leet.</Q></P></NOTE> and by the attainder of Charles Earl of We&s;tmoreland, was forfeited to the Crown in the year 1571, with his other large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the Life of Lord Keeper Guildford, we have an account of a cu&s;|tom held here. As this country was perilous to travellers, the tenants of each manor were bound to guard the Judge through their re&s;pective precincts. Lord Chief Ju&s;tice North de&s;cribes his attendants with long
<PB N="133" REF="166">
beards, &s;hort cloaks, long ba&s;ket-hilted broad &s;words, hanging from broad belts, and mounted on little hor&s;es, &s;o that their legs and &s;words touched the ground at every turning. The Sheriff pre&s;ented his train with arms, viz. a dagger, knife, penknife, and fork.</P>
<P>By the two piers yet remaining in the river, it appears there was an ancient bridge over Tyne here; but as it is remarked by workmen, that the piers have not had a &s;pring of arches, it is evident the &s;uper&s;tructure was of wood. The ruins of the chapel appertaining to Bywell Ca&s;tle, are &s;ituate on the &s;outhern banks of the river.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this delightful &s;cene, without making a compari&s;on be|tween the aera of 1580 and the pre&s;ent age:&mdash;the record I have given in my note, affords a deplorable evidence of the circum&s;tances attending the inhabitants of Tyne, when they were obliged to guard their cattle every night, and to cultivate no more lands than in proportion to the places of defence they had to &s;ecure their crops; living in a &s;tate of perpetual warfare and jeopardy. And even the&s;e calamities, which aro&s;e from a vicinity of thieves and robbers, were trifling, when com|pared to the deva&s;tation and ruin, which marked the incur&s;ions of the Scots. The&s;e were only the incidental grievances of the times; but there was one which was continued&mdash;the va&s;&s;alage and mi&s;ery of a feodal tenure; by which genius was kept in fetters, and indu&s;try was di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the name of &s;lavery. What then was the e&s;tate of this opulent and beautiful county of Northumberland, when com|pared to the pre&s;ent time? What ble&s;&s;ings have flowed in upon this land, from the union of the kingdoms, and the excellent police of the age? The ferocity of the inhabitants is &s;ubdued; traffic, arts, &s;ciences, manufactories, and navigation, have taken place of the brutal warfare, which is extingui&s;hed; Cultivation, with all the comeline&s;s of Plenty, laughs in the valleys; the &s;treams are taught to labour in mechanic &s;y&s;tems, to aid the manufacturer; every Creek and Bay is thronged with Ships; the gloomy Tower, that frowned defiance from each Emi|nence, &s;inks in the du&s;t, whil&s;t a Palace receives the de&s;cendants of her Lord, with all the bounties of Opulence and Peace. De&s;ert plains &s;tained with Slaughter, and track'd with the progre&s;s of Rapine and Violence, formerly &s;pread forth an exten&s;ive &s;cene of de&s;olation, where now ri&s;ing woods, inclo&s;ed farms, villages, and hamlets are di&s;po&s;ed under the &s;miles of Pro&s;perity. The original naked inhabitants (&s;avage from hunger and nece&s;&s;ity, lurking in dens, and in the mountains

<P>The cu&s;tom of wi&s;hing health or pro&s;perity, at the time of drinking, is very ancient&mdash;it is not po&s;&s;ible to trace it to its &s;ource: we have te&s;timonies of it among the cu&s;toms of mo&s;t of the ancient nations: it was u&s;ed as a religious ceremony with many; the wine was offered in the &s;acred ve&s;&s;el, and the Deity invoked; after which a little was &s;pilt on the altar, and the public prayer being made, the petitioner put his lips to the cup.</P>
<P>It would afford great a&s;toni&s;hment to a foreigner, in who&s;e country no &s;uch cu&s;tom has gained acceptation, to be brought into a company of Engli&s;hmen, where jollity and convivial mirth had begun to take place: we will pre&s;ume the vi&s;itant, by his interpreter, is introduced to a know|ledge of the characters before him, in order that we may heighten the lines of his &s;urprize:&mdash;how would he be amazed, to hear a man, who in common life and conver&s;ation expre&s;&s;es no religion, morality, prin|ciples, or public virtue, praying with all the vehemence of an Enthu|&s;ia&s;t, on his knees, before he drinks to the pro&s;perity of the object of his wi&s;hes; who is, perhaps, no other than &s;ome factious wretch, and rebellious di&s;turber of the commonweal; whil&s;t the circle of communi|cants, &s;tanding around like Canibals at &s;ome horrid fe&s;tival, or Daemons at an infernal convocation, in every di&s;tortion of body and countenance, which can expre&s;s an agitated &s;oul and an inflamed mind, halloo with all the ardour of unlimited licentiou&s;ne&s;s, in the hideous yells of Hot|tentots?&mdash;When &s;uch a vi&s;iter, returned to his native land, &s;hould re|late the &s;cene, and tell his a&s;toni&s;hed countrymen, that with the poli&s;hed Britons this was jollity and public &s;pirit; could he be believed?&mdash;Would he not, like Mandeville on his vi&s;it to the vale of Devils, to &s;ave his credit, be obliged to add, "Men &s;ayen for I hav' not &s;eyen." As to my part, I think a vehement Partizan, in the ardent act of drinking a con&s;titutional Toa&s;t, as he would term it, is as odious and ridiculous an Animal as Nature can exhibit.</P>

<P>in the neighbourhood of Fenwick Tower, next attracted our notice. In the reigns of King John, and King Henry III. it was the manor of Philip de Ulcote, who held it by Grand Sergeancy, on keeping the pleas of the Crown. He was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with Hugh de Baliol, 17 King John, A. D. 1216, to hold the ca&s;tle and town of Berwick upon Tweed again&s;t the Barons. It afterwards became the inheritance of the Feltons, till by marriage it devolved on Sir Edward de Ha&s;tings. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir Ra. Law&s;on, and after changing its owners &s;everal times from that period, is now the e&s;tate of Sir Edward Blacket, who&s;e man&s;ion-hou&s;e is &s;eated on a
<PB N="136" REF="169">
fine eminence, &s;hielded by exten&s;ive woods, above the river Pont, with a vi&s;ta of con&s;iderable extent opening upon the military road. The hou&s;e and plea&s;ure grounds are highly plea&s;ing, though not pompous: there is that elegance which perfect neatne&s;s con&s;titutes, to be di&s;cerned in the whole.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the vi&s;ta, is a rude &s;tone Column, nine feet high, near which lately &s;tood a Tumulus, which on account of building a farm-hou&s;e, has been de&s;troyed; the people living near it, &s;ay it was near 30 yards in circumference at the foot; but as no re|mains were left for me to make my ob&s;ervations upon, I will give the de&s;cription found in Mr Wallis's book verbatim. <Q>In a field on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the vi&s;ta, about three quarters of a mile from the hou&s;e, is a circular Mount, with a round cavity in the middle, of the form of the Celtic Tumuli, or Temples; an upright &s;tone pillar &s;tanding by it, of a great &s;ize, nine feet high above ground, with flat &s;ides, three feet broad, and a foot and a half thick. The mount is com|po&s;ed of earth and numerous ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone, of the coar&s;e rag kind, many of which have been digged up for the u&s;e of this farm, and among them were di&s;covered two &s;tone che&s;ts or coffins, con&s;i&s;ting of four flags &s;et edgeways, with a bottom &s;tone and a &s;tone cover, con|taining the a&s;hes of the dead, appearing like a white du&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>From this de&s;cription, I apprehend it was one of the mo&s;t curious pieces of antiquity, of the Tumuli order, that was in this county, or perhaps the north of England. I humbly conceive it was not a Celtic Temple, as Mr Wallis calls it, being evidently appropriated to the &s;e|pulture of the dead; a defilement at no time permitted by the Druids in their holy places. Its di&s;tant antiquity is proved by the mode of &s;epulture; the burning of the decea&s;ed, after the manner of the Ro|mans, was not attended with the mode di&s;tingui&s;hed herein interment; the Danes u&s;ed burning the decea&s;ed, but we have no evidence in what manner they practi&s;ed it in England. From the cavity on the crown of the mount, &s;imilar to &s;ome of the Druids monuments I have &s;een, I am induced to apprehend, this was the mau&s;oleum of the Druid tribe, and of the remote&s;t antiquity; and that &s;uch cavity was adapted to rites paid to the manes of the decea&s;ed. Pillars and other memorials of &s;e|pulture, were originally devi&s;ed as mementos to the pa&s;&s;enger, of the precariou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence, and by remembrance of the virtues of the dead, to promote our emulation. The cu&s;tom of burning the re|mains
<PB N="137" REF="170">
of men of rank or power, gained an acceptation in very early ages; it was con&s;i&s;tent with the general ideas of tho&s;e who held the Amonian rites; the &s;pirit or human &s;oul was e&s;teemed to be a &s;park of etherial fire, an emanation of the Deity, who made his throne in the orbit of the &s;un, to which they looked up in wor&s;hip; which divine e&s;&s;ence, in this life, was ca&s;ed up in members of mortality, during a pilgrimage allotted to it in a terre&s;trial &s;tate: to re&s;tore to that element again this offspring of heavenly light, they reduced even the loath&s;ome memorials of its bondage, that nothing &s;hould remain which might cau&s;e it to linger on earth. But I will add no further to this &s;ubject, than by way of note, to give the reader the quotations and reflections of Mr Wallis.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Temples and funeral memorials like this, with cepititious or &s;tone altars, and an upright pillar untouched by the chi&s;el, are the mo&s;t ancient of any in the world, were rai&s;ed in Judea and all over the Holy Land, by the ea&s;tern Princes and Patriarchs, by whom they were called Bethels and Elbethels. The manner of con&s;ecration, was with oil poured on the pillar.&mdash;One of the&s;e pillars was erected by Jacob, and he called is the hou&s;e of God. <Q>Jacob ro&s;e up early in the morning, and took the &s;tone that he had put for his pillow, and &s;et it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city was called Luz, at the fir&s;t. And he &s;aid, this &s;tone which I have &s;et up for a pillar &s;hall be God's hou&s;e. Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, (that is Bethel) he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel. And Jacob &s;et up a pillar in the place where he talked with God, even a pillar of &s;tone, and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called the name of the place where God &s;pake with him Bethel.</Q></P>
<P>The making of altars of earth, or of natural &s;tone as formed in the earth, was by the direc|tion of God to Mo&s;es. <Q>An altar of earth thou &s;halt make unto me. And if thou wilt make me an altar of &s;tone, thou &s;halt not build it of hewn &s;tone, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou ha&s;t polluted it.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e temples were generally erected on the higher ground, &s;uch as were mo&s;t con&s;picuous and obvious to fight. The one was built by Mo&s;es and another by Jo&s;hua on Mount Ebal, compo&s;ed of whole natural &s;tones, or pillars plai&s;tered with plai&s;ter, whereon they wrote the divine laws, in a great and general a&s;&s;embly of all I&s;rael, of all the princes, great officers, judges, and people of every rank and quality, &s;trangers and others, old and young.</P>
<P>Single pillars were al&s;o erected by the&s;e holy men over the graves of the illu&s;trious dead by &s;ome public and much frequented road, to have their memories pre&s;erved, and to put the tra|veller in mind of their exemplary virtue and piety, of his own &s;hort continuance on the &s;tage of life, and to fit and make him&s;elf worthy of &s;uch another honourable memorial at his death, and of an eternal diadem. Thus Jacob buried Rachel, the &s;olace and partner of his cares, who died with the birth of their &s;on Benjamin. "Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrah, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob &s;et a pillar on her grave, that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day."</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of inferior condition and figure were buried under the &s;hady oaks that flouri&s;hed at the bottom of the mounts on which the bethels or temples &s;tood. They were called the oaks of weeping. <Q>Deborah, Rebekah's nur&s;e, died, and &s;he was buried beneath Bethel, under an oak, and the name of it was called Allon Backuth.</Q></P>
<P>Heaps of &s;tones rudely ca&s;t together were the tombs they a&s;&s;igned to infidel enemies after execution, even crowned heads, in avenues and places of great concour&s;e, to be warnings to the re&s;t of mankind, how they ro&s;e up again&s;t the God of I&s;rael, and di&s;honoured his bethel or holy temple. Such a memorial had the King of Ai, executed by Jo&s;hua. <Q>As &s;oon as the &s;un was down, Jo&s;hua commanded that they &s;hould take his carca&s;s down from the tree, and ca&s;t it on the entring of the gate of the city, and rai&s;e thereon a great heap of &s;tones, that remaineth to this day.</Q></P>
<P>Such a memorial likewi&s;e had Achan and his family, who&s;e bodies were fir&s;t burnt to a&s;hes, with all their trea&s;ure and wealth.</P>
<P>Hence the open temples, the pillars, the obeli&s;ks, the con&s;ecrated groves of oak, the heaps of &s;tones reared by the Pagans to their fal&s;e Gods, and to the memory of the dead. Hence the Egyptian pyramid, hence the fair column of the Greeks, the Romans, and of the &s;everal na|tions taught and ruled by the Druids: the primitive religious rites accompanying mankind upon their grand di&s;per&s;ion at the tower of Babel, about the 400th year after the flood, according to the Samaritan computation.</P>

<HEAD>HALTON CHESTERS,</HEAD>
<P>the Hunnum of the Romans, &s;ituate on an ea&s;y de&s;cent; the remains of the Vallum not perfectly to be traced.&mdash;This &s;tation is the next fort that appears upon the wall between Rutche&s;ter and Walwick Che&s;ters, and comes at a due di&s;tance, and in proper order for the ancient Hun|num, the fifth &s;tation in the &s;eries of the Notitia, garri&s;oned by the Ala Saviniana.</P>
<P>Mr Gordon, omitting the &s;tation at Halton, makes Walwick Che&s;ters to be Hunnum, and &s;uppo&s;es Cilurnum, the next &s;tation in the Notitia, to have been between Walwick Che&s;ters and Precolitia or Carrawbrugh, but now entirely demoli&s;hed. This cannot hold, for the walls and their appurtenances are here in the greate&s;t perfection; how then &s;hould a fort on that part of the wall be entirely ruined, &s;o as not to have the lea&s;t ve&s;tige remaining? Be&s;ides, the great di&s;tance between Rutche&s;ter and Walwick, which is above twelve miles, &s;hews that there mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t one &s;tation between them; and on the other hand, the &s;mall di&s;tance between Walwick Che&s;ters and Carrawbrugh, which is little more than three mea&s;ured miles, renders it mo&s;t unlikely that there ever &s;hould have been another &s;tation between them.</P>
<P>Hadrian's Vallum &s;eems to have fallen in with the &s;outh rampart of this fort, and Severus's wall with the north line of the inner part. There &s;eems to have been an aqueduct to convey water to this &s;tation, from a &s;pring on the higher ground, near Watling-&s;treet-gate: when Mr Hor&s;ley pa&s;&s;ed that way, he &s;ays he was &s;hewn a part of it by a countryman, who &s;aid, it was what the &s;peaking trumpet was lodged in: of this matter I have treated before.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="174">The ruins of the out-buildings are to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t of the fort. Near about a furlong to the ea&s;t of Watling-&s;treet-gate, is a vi|&s;ible Ca&s;tellum, and at the gate there has been a &s;quare Ca&s;tellum, half within the wall and half without.</P>
<P>Mr Hor&s;ley remarks, that Severus's military way appears very di&s;tinct for the &s;mall &s;paces where it is &s;eparated from Hadrian's north Vallum; regularly paved, but not much rai&s;ed above the level of the ground. When the two are united, they make a military way very beautiful and magnificent: and the re&s;t both of Severus's and Hadrian's works are ample and con&s;picuous all this way. As for the cour&s;e of Severus's military way, and its coinciding with Hadrian's north Vallum, and go|ing off from it again at every Ca&s;tellum, it &s;eems very curious, and it is remarkable that it has not been more ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>From St O&s;walds to the river of North Tyne, &s;ome parts or appur|tenances of the walls become more faint and ob&s;cure, and &s;ome not vi|&s;ible at all; but yet Severus's wall, the ditch, and Hadrian's Vallum and ditch, are very apparent. After the wall has cro&s;&s;ed the Tyne, it goes to Walwick, as before de&s;cribed: the di&s;tance from whence to Hal|ton Che&s;ters is near five mea&s;ured miles and a quarter, and in this in|terval there are five vi&s;ible Ca&s;tella, be&s;ides one that mu&s;t have &s;tood near the river Tyne, but is now entirely lo&s;t. The con&s;tant di&s;tance between the&s;e Ca&s;tella &s;eems to have been &s;even furlongs.</P>
<P>Dr Hunter, Mr Smith, and others, take notice of &s;ome remains at Portgate, or near it, within a mile of the Che&s;ters: and in the new edition of Camden, it is ob&s;erved, that <Q>there is at Portgate, a &s;quare old tower &s;till &s;tanding, and great ruins of old buildings.</Q> But it was Mr Hor&s;ley's opinion this tower had nothing in it that was Roman, being of the &s;ame form with a multitude of others that are in the north, and of a much later date.

Roger de Clavering, Baron of Warkworth, had this manor by a grant of King John, with the privilege of an annual fair, on the day of St John the Bapti&s;t, and a weekly market. The manor, by the &s;urrender of John the la&s;t Baron Clavering, came to the Crown in the reign of King Edward I. by King Edward III. it was granted to Henry Lord Percy, and is now part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the pre&s;ent Duke of Nor|thumberland.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Edward I. A. D. 1296, the Scots burnt Corbridge, on their incur&s;ions, at the &s;ame time that they de&s;troyed Hexham. In the reign of Edward II. Corbridge again &s;uffered by the Scots, A. D. 1311.</P>

We intended whil&s;t upon our journey, to have procured a drawing of this curious piece of antiquity; but on our arrival at Alnwick, found the ca&s;tle crowded with vi&s;itants, it being one of his Grace's public days, when the popularity and libera &s;pirit, &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed in his Grace's character, laid open the gates of his palace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The annexed plate is a copy taken from the Engraving by Vertue.</NOTE></P>

<P>"A few days &s;ince, near the Roman wall in Northumberland, was found by a &s;mith's daughter in Corbridge, an ancient piece of &s;ilver, in &s;hape like a tea-board, 20 inches long, and 15 broad, hollowed about an inch deep, with a flat brim, an inch and a quarter broad, neatly flowered with a vine full of grapes, &amp;c.&mdash;On the right hand is a figure of <HI>Apollo,</HI> with the bow in his left hand, and a phy&s;ical herb in his right, under a canopy &s;upported by two Corinthian pillars; near his left leg is a <HI>Tyre,</HI> under it an <HI>Heli&s;trope,</HI> and at his feet a <HI>Python;</HI> near the right hand pillar is another of a different form, with a &s;un for its capital; again&s;t this &s;its a <HI>Prie&s;te&s;s</HI> on a tripod, who looks over her &s;houlder at <HI>Apollo,</HI> under her feet is an altar, near which lies a &s;tag on his back.&mdash;The next figure to the Prie&s;te&s;s is another female, her head unveiled, with a &s;pear or wand in her left hand, on the top of which is a ball, and near her is <HI>Minerva</HI> with a helmet on her head, a &s;pear in her left hand, pointing with her right to a man (&s;uppo&s;ed an Hunter) on the other &s;ide of a large tree; on Minerva's brea&s;t is a <HI>Medu&s;a's head,</HI> under her feet an altar, and near it a wolf looking up to a man who has a bow in his left, and an arrow in his right hand; below him, at one corner of the plate, is a rock with an urn in the mid&s;t of it, from which flows a &s;tream. The figures are rai&s;ed large, and well proportioned and ca&s;t-work, without the lea&s;t &s;ign of a graver upon it. There are a few &s;cratches of a punch or chi&s;el on the back of it; the three fir&s;t are I. PX, but the re&s;t is very unintelligible. It had under the middle of it a low frame, about 7 inches long, 4 broad, and one and an half deep, but this was broken off by the &s;mith, though once all of a piece. It was found by a little brook or water-cour&s;e near the above-mentioned place, and weighing about 148 ounces, was bought by Mr Cook&s;on, a gold|&s;mith of Newca&s;tle, who values it at a high rate. It has been de&s;cribed by &s;everal <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> to the Royal Society, that of the Antiquarians, and others, who e&s;teem it a valuable relique of antiquity."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"My fondne&s;s to antiquity is revived, and with it the memory of my obligations to you, by a Silver Table that has lately fallen into the hands of Mr I&s;aac Cook&s;on, a gold&s;mith in this town. It was found near Corbridge, by &s;ome ignorant poor people, who have cut off the feet in &s;uch a vile barbarous manner, that they have broke two holes through the table, and a &s;mall piece off one of the corners too. It is 19 inches and &frac12; long, and 15 broad, the feet 7&frac12; long, and 5&frac12; broad, and about one inch high; it weighs about 150 ounces. I imagine it to have been ca&s;t all in one piece, mo&s;t of the work is in ba&s;&s;e relief, the re&s;t engraved. It repre&s;ents a &s;acrifice to <HI>Apollo,</HI> who&s;e image &s;tands in a &s;mall temple by two Corinthian pillars, again&s;t one of them &s;eems to be a pile of &s;ome &s;quare blocks, and clo&s;e to it &s;its a Prie&s;te&s;s upon a &s;tool, that &s;hews but two feet; behind her is a column with a globe upon it, I &s;uppo&s;e to repre&s;ent the &s;un, though had it been alone I &s;hould not have thought &s;o: near her &s;tands another in the &s;ame habit, and a third that &s;eems to have the attributes of <HI>Pallas,</HI> particularly the head-piece. Near the la&s;t is a man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This figure is Diana, not a man.&mdash;R. G.</NOTE> with a bow in his left hand, and an arrow in his right, before him is an altar and a dog, I think a grey|hound near him; behind him is a large &s;preading tree, with an eagle parched upon it; there are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall birds about it, but the&s;e are only engraved. In the lower corner next the man, on the left hand as you look at it, there is a rocky hill, and on the &s;ide of it lies an urn, with a &s;tream of water running out; perhaps de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the river Tyne. The two &s;tanding women hold each of them a &s;taff of their own height. Afore the temple is another altar, on one &s;ide of which lies a griffin, and on the other &s;ide next the man, a buck, which &s;eems to be killed for a &s;acrifice; near the buck grow two ears of corn tyed together, and near the griffin a &s;hrub of three or four branches, that has at the end of each branch &s;omewhat formed like a fan. There is a border rai&s;ed round the whole, higher than the plain, which is adorned with a vine; the branch is engraved, but the grapes and leaves are in ba&s;&s;e relief.

<P>"Soon after the po&s;t was gone from hence, I received yours of the 11th. This morning I went to the gold&s;mith, who &s;oon convinced me of my error in &s;aying the birds, &amp;c. were engraved; and that all which I thought to be engraved, was &s;truck with the chi&s;el and punch; &s;o that I mu&s;t own your &s;u&s;picions were well grounded. Mr Cook&s;on's father happens to be here now; I take him to be well ver&s;ed in the art of ca&s;ting of metals; he &s;hewed me &s;everal marks near one end, in the middle of which end there is a crack; which marks and crack, he &s;ays, are proofs that it was ca&s;t in one piece.</P>
<P>"I enquired again about the price, but Mr Cook&s;on waved &s;aying any thing different from what I mentioned to you ye&s;terday; which was, that he hoped it would produce him about 200 guineas.</P>
<P>"As to the place where it was found, he &s;ays, he can tell me no more, than that it was &s;omewhere near Corbridge. He apprehends the per&s;on who &s;old it to him was afraid to name the particular place, or to confe&s;s in who&s;e manor it was di&s;covered, as fearing a claim from the Lord of the Manor.</P>

<HEAD>Letter from <HI>Sir John Clerk,</HI> in an&s;wer to one from <HI>Mr Gale,</HI> giving an account of the Corbridge Silver Plate.</HEAD>
<P>"The account you have &s;ent me of the &s;ilver table found near Cor|bridge is very &s;urprizing. How happy had Mr Gorden and I been, when we were hunting for Roman Antiquities in that country, if this valuable curio&s;ity had fallen into our hands! As to the u&s;e of it, I make no que&s;tion of its being a <HI>tabula votiva,</HI> and that it has been hung up, or kept in a temple, at Corbridge; dedicated perhaps to <HI>Apollo</HI> or <HI>Ceres.</HI> No doubt the Roman officer, who commanded in the&s;e northern parts of Britain, thought him&s;elf very happy, to find good meat and drink, in a country where he expected to find nothing, but famine and bar|barity; and therefore in gratitude made this pre&s;ent to the God of the place.</P>
<P>"I cannot help, &s;ince I am in this way of thinking, to reflect a little upon what I ob&s;erved in a church, called <HI>Notre Dame de Halle,</HI> about 12 miles from Bru&s;&s;els; the walls were hung round with &s;ilver legs and arms, cups, and &s;everal other things in &s;ilver, as tokens of gratitude to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, for having by her means and interce&s;&s;ion, been reco|vered from infirmities and di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>"Among other things, I could not but take notice of a Silver Pen, which old doating <HI>Ju&s;tus Lip&s;ius</HI> had &s;ent thither &s;ome years before, out of gratitude, as an in&s;cription told us, for that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Virgin Mary, he had been enabled with &s;o much eloquence, &amp;c. to write a Treati&s;e <HI>de Miraculis B.

<P>"You are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;ome doubt, as to the engraving; and I think you have rea&s;on. The Romans, I believe, never practi&s;ed our

way of engraving, yet they did what was next to it, for they were u&s;ed to cut &s;ome remarkable laws and edicts in bra&s;s tables, as they u&s;ed to make in&s;criptions in marble or &s;tone. I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e, parti|cularly at Lyons, which at that time made me reflect on the dulne&s;s of the Romans, and all mankind be&s;ides, that by means of the&s;e bra&s;s plates they had not fallen upon the art of printing; for if the&s;e had been daubed over with any &s;ort of colour, and clapt upon the paper or parchment, they would &s;oon have introduced that art; but there are many plain things that mankind cannot &s;ee into all of a &s;udden, and which are re&s;erved for po&s;terity.

On reading your account of that ma&s;&s;y piece, &s;ome of us thought it might have been part of an <HI>Acerra,</HI> or &s;acred coffer, wherein incen&s;e and odours were pre&s;erved for the &s;ervice of the altar, or &s;alt, &amp;c. for &s;ome &s;orts of &s;acrifices; others have perhaps with more rea&s;on conceived it to be a &s;tand, &s;alver, or &s;ort of waiter to &s;et &s;uch things on, or even the <HI>Acerra,</HI> or perhaps for dome&s;tick u&s;es; for we are too apt to apply every relique of antiquity, as being venerable, to

<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I am glad that upon viewing the Silver Table you think it ancient. This was always the notion I conceived of it, for I could not imagine any modern Sculptor could get into his head &s;o much ancient imagery, without any foundation from ancient hi&s;tory or fable. I am indifferent who gets the better in the law-&s;uit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke of Somer&s;et again&s;t Mr Cook&s;on.</NOTE> but I hope it will be pre&s;erved and kept in the country. I fancy with my&s;elf you will be able to di&s;cover &s;ome piece of our hi&s;tory from it; for I make not the lea&s;t que&s;tion but it has been a pre&s;ent from &s;ome of the Roman Emperors, and alludes to &s;ome memorable affairs at the time. The table has &s;erved, I believe, for an oblation of fruits or corn on &s;ome remarkable altar near the wall, erected to the honour of perhaps <HI>Diana, Ceres,</HI> or <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and that it has afterwards been hung up in the temple dedicated to one of the&s;e Deities. An Iri&s;hman would perhaps di&s;cover the antiquity of Ireland from the Harp, and I believe you will be inclined to think one of the figures is a repre&s;entation of Britain. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Letter from <HI>Roger Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> to Mr <HI>Robert Cay,</HI> upon the Silver Plate found at Corbridge.</HEAD>
<P>"When I wrote la&s;t, I had only time to return you thanks for the favour you procured me from Mr Cook&s;on, of taking a draught of his mo&s;t curious Silver Table, being to go out of town next morning. Since I came back, upon peru&s;ing the letters I received from you on that occa&s;ion, I find in one of them a de&s;ire of knowing my thoughts upon that &s;ubject, which I cannot refu&s;e to a gentleman who has laid me under &s;o many obligations, and to whom the plea&s;ure and enter|tainment I have received from the frequent views of that uncommon and valuable piece of antiquity, are entirely due; and the le&s;s, becau&s;e the accounts hitherto publi&s;hed of it &s;eem to me not a little erroneous.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall begin to de&s;cribe it from the right hand to the left, as you look upon the face of the plate, where <HI>Apollo,</HI> the principal figure in the whole piece, is placed in a <HI>fanum</HI> or &s;mall temple, (the roof of which is &s;upported by two wreathed columns with flowered capitals) almo&s;t naked, having only a <HI>pallium</HI> hanging down from his left &s;houlder over his
<PB N="155" REF="189">
back; in the &s;ame hand is his bow, which he holds up towards the top of the column on the &s;ame &s;ide; his right hand is extended down|wards with a branch in it, perhaps of laurel, cro&s;s that pillar; again&s;t which, almo&s;t to the middle of it, ri&s;es a pyramidical pile of 12 pieces: for what it is intended, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my ignorance.&mdash;<HI>See the plate.</HI></P>
<P>"Again&s;t the ba&s;is of the left hand column, re&s;ts a lyre, who&s;e form is truly antique; and beneath it grows a plant with three &s;preading flowers at its three extremities, de&s;igned, as I &s;uppo&s;e, for an <HI>Heliotrope;</HI> clo&s;e by it couches a <HI>Griffin,</HI> with its wings elevated over its back. The Ancients had &s;o high an opinion of the &s;agacity of this fictitious animal, that they con&s;ecrated it to the God of Wi&s;dom: <HI>Begerus</HI> gives us a medal of <HI>Commodus,</HI> the rever&s;e whereof is <HI>Apollo</HI> in a chariot drawn by two <HI>Griffins;</HI> and the poet <HI>Claudian</HI> alludes to this manner of his riding, in the following di&s;tich:
<Q><L>Ac &s;i Phoebus ade&s;t, et fraenis Grypha jugalem</L>
<L>Riphaeo, tripodas repetens, detor&s;it ab axis, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Claudian VI. Con&s;. Honorii.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>"Again&s;t the right hand column and this pyramidical pile, &s;its a woman, upon a &s;quare four-footed &s;tool, though no more than two of its legs are vi&s;ible; &s;he looks backward over her left &s;houlder towards <HI>Apollo,</HI> and is wrapped up in a long garment or &s;tola, from head to foot, and veiled. By this attire, and the altar which was brought from Troy, with the eternal fire burning upon it ju&s;t by her, I take her to be <HI>Ve&s;ta.</HI></P>

<P>Her left hand is repo&s;ed upon her brea&s;t, and in her right, which re&s;ts upon the &s;ame thigh, &s;he holds a little bundle (bound about with a ribbon) perhaps of wool.</P>
<P>"Below her lies a buck, dead, on one &s;ide, turning up his belly; and behind her ri&s;es a tall pillar with a globe upon it, probably to de|note the earth, of which &s;he was Godde&s;s.</P>
<P>"The next is a woman erect, her hair gathered up and tied with a knot behind, upon her forehead ri&s;es a <HI>Tutulus,</HI> and &s;he is habited in a <HI>Stola</HI> from her &s;houlders to the ground: her right arm is wrapped up cro&s;s her brea&s;t in her garb, only the hand appearing out of it; in her
<PB N="156" REF="190">
left &s;he holds a &s;pear, the &s;haft twi&s;ted, the iron of it &s;omething obtu&s;e. This &s;eems to be the only human figure in the company; but a very learned gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Blackwall, author of the Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer.</NOTE> of my acquaintance thinks it may be de&s;igned for <HI>Juno,</HI> who is often thus accoutred with a &s;pear; if &s;o, it mu&s;t be the effigies of <HI>Juno curis,</HI> or <HI>Juno ha&s;tata,</HI> we have it from Ovid,
<Q>"&mdash; Quod ha&s;ta curis pri&s;cis e&s;t dicta &s;abinis."</Q>
She was the &s;ame with <HI>Juno pronuba;</HI> <Q>Celebri ha&s;ta nubentis caput co|mebatur, vel quia <HI>Junonis curitis</HI> in tutel&acirc; e&s;&s;et, vel ut fortes viros ominaretur;</Q> but as there is no peacock, nor any other attribute of her divinity attending her, and her appearance no ways maje&s;tick or adequate to the
<Q><L>&mdash;Divum regina, Jovi&s;que</L>
<L>Et &s;oror et conjux.</L></Q>
I cannot be entirely of his opinion, e&s;pecially as &s;he &s;eems by her po&s;ture and attitude to be a follower and attendant of the next figure, which is plainly <HI>"Pallas&mdash;Gale&aacute; effulgens et Gorgone &s;aev&aacute;,"</HI> the head of that mon&s;ter, as u&s;ual, being fixt upon her brea&s;t. In her left hand &s;he holds a &s;harp-pointed &s;pear, her right is extended towards <HI>Diana,</HI> with whom &s;he &s;eems engaged in a very earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, to which al&s;o that Godde&s;s &s;eems very attentive: &s;he is the la&s;t figure in the group, though called a man in all the accounts I have &s;een of this table, and repre|&s;ented here as the <HI>Diana venatrix</HI> by the <HI>coif</HI> and feminine dre&s;s of her head, tuck'd up with a knot behind like the hair of the third figure, as well as by the bow in her left and arrow in her right hand. Her &s;hort <HI>Tunica,</HI> which reaches down little more than to the middle of her thighs, and her bu&s;kins, that come up no higher than the calf of her legs, has occa&s;ioned this mi&s;take of her &s;ex, but Ovid tells us,
<Q><L>"Talia &s;uccincta pinguntur crura <HI>Dianae</HI></L>
<L>"Cum &s;equitur fortes, fortior ip&s;a, feras."</L></Q>
Between the two figures of <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Diana,</HI> ri&s;es a tall &s;lender tree with a crooked waving &s;tem, the branches of which are di&s;played al|mo&s;t over two-thirds of the top of the plate. On the main branch is perch'd an eagle, with one wing expanded, as if going to take a flight: this is of rai&s;ed &s;olid work, like the re&s;t of the figures, but there are &s;everal &s;mall birds &s;itting among the boughs, that are only punch'd, or cut in with a tool, as are al&s;o &s;everal fe&s;toons hanging down from the
<PB N="157" REF="191">
tree, and many other little &s;hrubs and flowers inter&s;per&s;ed all over the area of the table. The great bird &s;itting directly over the head of <HI>Pallas,</HI> made me conclude at fir&s;t that it was her owl, till I had &s;een the ori|ginal, which convinced me that it can be de&s;igned for nothing but an eagle.</P>
<P>"Under this tree &s;tands an altar, and &s;o clo&s;e to <HI>Diana,</HI> that &s;he holds her left hand and bow over it. It is but little, and has nothing upon it except a &s;mall globular body, perhaps a ma&s;s of the <HI>Libamina, ex farre, melle, et oleo.</HI></P>
<P>"I &s;hould have told you, that below the feet of <HI>Pallas</HI> grows a plant, which &s;eems to bear two ears of corn upon the &s;ame &s;talk, but cannot &s;ay what it is, or how it belongs to her. Beneath the tree and the little altar, &s;tands a thin-gutted dog, like a greyhound, his no&s;e turned up in a howling or barking po&s;ture, as often exhibited with this God|de&s;s on medals, and in other repre&s;entations of her: &s;ome
<Q><L>&mdash; Acutae vocis Hyclator</L>
<L>Aut &s;ub&s;tricta gerens Sicyonius Ilia Ludon.</L>
<BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q>
Under her, in the very corner of the plate, ri&s;es a rock, upon which &s;he &s;ets her left foot, and again&s;t the &s;ide of it lies an <HI>urn</HI> with the mouth downwards, di&s;charging a plentiful &s;tream of water. As &s;he &s;tands upon this rock or hill, and &s;o near to this &s;preading tree, I cannot but think of Horace's addre&s;s to her,
<Q>"Montium cu&s;tos, Nemorumque Virgo."</Q>
The whole table is encompa&s;&s;ed with a border, rai&s;ed near an inch high, and ornamented with a creeping vine, who&s;e grapes and leaves are in <HI>relievo,</HI> but the &s;talk only tooled.</P>
<P>"The work of this curious piece is neither of the be&s;t or wor&s;t of times: the figure of <HI>Ve&s;ta,</HI> particularly, is extremely well executed, the po&s;ture free, the drapery &s;oft and ea&s;y; and what is very remarkable, the <HI>in&s;tita</HI> or border, an ornament of the <HI>&s;tola,</HI> appropriated to the Ro|man ladies of quality.</P>
<P>"Quarum &s;ub&s;uta talos tegit in&s;tita ve&s;te,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horace.</NOTE> is neatly worked all round this of our <HI>Ve&s;ta,</HI> and tho&s;e of the other female Deities, nor is the next figure much inferior. I cannot, nor has any body el&s;e who has &s;een it, di&s;cover that the plan has any relation to any &s;tory in the
<PB N="158" REF="192">
<HI>Heathen Mythology,</HI> but &s;eems only an a&s;&s;emblage of the Deities it re|pre&s;ents: this may be &s;ome argument of its antiquity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir John Clerk's Letter, 6th Augu&s;t, 1735.</NOTE> for had a mo|dern workman had the de&s;igning of it, he would in all probability have taken &s;ome known piece of hi&s;tory for his &s;ubject; to which I may add, all the &s;ymbols are genuine, and truly adapted to their owners.</P>
<P>"I was once of opinion, that it might have been the cover of an <HI>Acerra,</HI> but the foot which &s;upported it puts an end to the &s;urmi&s;e. We don't well know what the <HI>Anclabris</HI> was, the definition of it is in <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> as follows: <Q>Anclabris men&s;a divinis mini&s;teriis apta: dicebantur autem an|clabria, et Anclabris ab anculare quod erat mini&s;trare.</Q> This is big enough to contain the <HI>Exta</HI> of a &s;heep, or other &s;mall victims, which &s;eems to me to be the likelie&s;t employment for it, and that it was one of the&s;e &s;acrificing uten&s;ils that Virgil more than once calls <HI>Lances:</HI>
<Q><L>"Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus Exta <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Virg. G. 2. v. 194.</NOTE></L>

<L>"Dona ferunt, cumul&aacute;ntque oneratis Lancibus Aras."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Virg. Aen. 8. v. 284.</NOTE></L></Q>
The&s;e <HI>Lances</HI> were both round and &s;quare, but the <HI>Di&s;cus</HI> u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;eems to have been always round.</P>
<P>"If you have the patience to read this over, you will have rea&s;on to think me not a little impertinent, in giving you &s;o minute a de&s;crip|tion, of what you had &s;een &s;o often, and &s;o long before it came under my view; but as I chance to have &s;ome notions different from what appeared to you, and as I could not well explain my thoughts upon it without entering into the particulars, I hope you will excu&s;e me.

We mu&s;t yet call it the Corbridge Plate, &s;ince at pre&s;ent it is &s;aid to have been found near that town; though I am inclined to think it is only given out &s;o, to conceal the true place where it was di&s;covered.

This conte&s;t with his Grace, made the owner very &s;hy of letting it be &s;een by any body, and it was not without great importunity that a gentleman, to whom he was under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations, procured me the favour of taking a draught of it, and upon condition that I &s;hould not permit any one to copy it, nor know where the original (which has been &s;hifted into two or three hands) is now depo&s;ited.

<P>"Your conjecture upon the <HI>pyramidical pile</HI> I like well: I was once of opinion that it might have been &s;ome &s;ort of an altar dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and that the 12 pieces of which it con&s;i&s;ts, might have &s;ome relation to the 12 months of the year. <HI>Tellus Stabilis</HI> we have upon the coins of <HI>Hadrian, Sabina Fau&s;tina Pii,</HI> and <HI>Commodus,</HI> but without this <HI>pyramis;</HI> in our table it is erected as near to <HI>Ve&s;ta</HI> as to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and &s;o may be an attribute belonging as well to her, the Godde&s;s of the Earth, as to him, the God of the Year.

<P>Mr Wallis (if not an error of his printer) &s;eems to be more mi&s;taken than Dr Todd in his opi|nion of this altar, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be an altar in honour of Tyrian Hercules, dedicated to Diodora the Prie&s;te&s;s. V. 2. p 127.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="196">There are &s;ome &s;ingular circum&s;tances attending the&s;e altars, which may perhaps be deemed companions.&mdash;They furni&s;h the only Greek in&s;criptions which were ever found in Great Bri|tain; they both con&s;i&s;t of a &s;ingle hexameter; they are in&s;cribed to Syrian Deities; and they are di&s;covered in the &s;ame pari&s;h of Corbridge &mdash;It is not extraordinary that Greek in&s;criptions &s;hould be &s;carce in England, it is rather nece&s;&s;ary to account, why any &s;uch &s;hould have been di&s;covered: Though the Romans mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed their own language and characters, yet &s;ome of them mu&s;t have been born under circum&s;tances which made the Greek tongue more fa|miliar to them; we need therefore only &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Pulcher</HI> and <HI>Diodora</HI> (who dedicate the&s;e two altars) were the &s;on and daughter of a Roman officer quartered in Greece, or &s;ome neighbour|ing province, and who died &s;oon after he had children by a Grecian wife; the Greek language would certainly be more familiar than the Latin to a Roman with &s;uch an education. They both con&s;i&s;ting of hexameters, &s;eem to prove, they were dedicated about the &s;ame time, and and that they were intended to be companions, e&s;pecially as their outward form is very &s;imilar, as well as the characters made u&s;e of. The greater difficulty &s;eems to be, why both altars &s;hould be in&s;cribed to the Syrian Deities, <HI>A&s;tarte</HI> and <HI>Tyrian Hercules.</HI> This however it &s;eems may be accounted for to ways, Pulcher and Diodora might po&s;&s;ibly have either re&s;ided or been born in Syria, and had perhaps received &s;ome good fortune, which they might a&s;cribe at lea&s;t to the&s;e Deities. It is conceived, that wherever a Roman continued for anytime, he probably wor&s;hipped the local Deities, when there were not temples at hand which were erected to the Gods adored at Rome. Such Romans therefore might continue their veneration for A&s;tarte and Tyrian Hercules, when removed from Syria to Britain. But po&s;&s;ibly, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that Pulcher and Diodora &s;hould have been at all in that province. There is one difficulty however &s;till remaining, with regard to the altar dedicated to Tyrian Hercules, which is, that it is in&s;cribed by a Woman and Archprie&s;te&s;s. At fir&s;t it &s;trikes, that &s;he mu&s;t have been Arch|prie&s;te&s;s to &s;uch a God, and I believe there are few in&s;tances of women having this dignity in the temples of male Deities at the &s;ame time that there would be a particular indelicacy if they devoted them&s;elves to Hercules.</P>
<P>As for the&s;e altars being found at Corbridge, it is ea&s;ily accounted for, if the above conjec|tures are allowed in other re&s;pects, becau&s;e it is known to have been a con&s;iderable &s;tation, and near to the Roman wall. The in&s;cription on the altar to the Tyrian Hercules hath already been four times engraved, and may perhaps be matter of curio&s;ity to compare the different co|pies, as the &s;tone is &s;oft, and &s;eems to have &s;uffered within the&s;e 70 years, &s;ome of the charac|ters being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed&mdash;That the in&s;cription is not more ancient than the time I a&s;cribe it to, may be proved, if it was nece&s;&s;ary, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;cribed in the la&s;t word APXIEPE'A.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the quick return you made to my fir&s;t letter, and the mo&s;t accurate copy of the Greek in&s;cription that you &s;ent with it. It was at the de&s;ire of <HI>Mr Mat|tatre</HI> that I wrote to you, and both he and I are of your opinion, that the &s;econd word could never have been <GAP DESC="foreign">; but then it is very difficult to unriddle the word <GAP DESC="foreign">. That gentleman has been very bu&s;y for &s;ome time in giving us a new edition of <HI>Dr Prideaux's Marmora Arundeliana;</HI> 170 &s;heets are already printed off, and as he is a per&s;on of the greate&s;t learning, indu&s;try, and accuracy, we may expect a performance equal to all tho&s;e qualifica|tions. Since the other Greek in&s;cription at <HI>Langche&s;ter</HI> is &s;o much obliterated that you can &s;carcely di&s;cern whether it is in that language or not, you may excu&s;e your&s;elf the trouble of &s;ending it to me, but I make no doubt of your taking notice of it in your great work, if it is only to &s;hew us that there has been one more in&s;cription in that tongue found in this i&s;land, where indeed it is very &s;trange that we &s;hould have any at all.</P>
<P><Q>As for the in&s;cription DEO HERCVLENTI lately di&s;covered at <HI>Rieche&s;ter,</HI> I take it to be the very &s;ame as if it had been <HI>Deo Herculi,</HI> and the termination ENTI to be only a <HI>metap la&s;mus</HI> after the Greek manner, as in the words <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.

<P>Mr Hor&s;ley publi&s;hed this in&s;cription, and e&s;teemed it one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities in Britain. It is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of Nor|thumberland.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="196">Mr Hor&s;ley gives the following reading and remarks upon it: <Q><GAP DESC="foreign">, h. e. Herculi Tirrio Diodora Princeps Sacerdos. It has been twice publi&s;hed in the Tran&s;actions by Dr Hunter and Dr

Todd. The differences between their copies and this will appear upon comparing them one with another. This copy was taken after the original had been thrice vi&s;ited and examined with care, and
<PB N="164" REF="198">
every variation in the former copies diligently marked. Dr Todd's delineation is different both from Dr Hunter's and mine. He tran&s;|lates it Herculi Tyrio divina dona archi&s;acerdotalia vel per &s;ummum Sacerdotem offerenda; but he offers no rea&s;on to confirm this tran&s;la|tion. Dr Hunter's copy has been taken with more exactne&s;s, but not without &s;ome little variations from the original; nor has he tran&s;lated or explained the in&s;cription: but the mo&s;t material difference be|tween the other copies and the original, is in the &s;econd letter of the &s;econd line, which they repre&s;ent as <GAP DESC="foreign">, though it is plainly <GAP DESC="foreign">. The next letter in the &s;ame line is very di&s;tinct, as to the greate&s;t part of it; but towards the top is a flaw in the &s;tone. If no &s;troke or part of the letter is lo&s;t in this flaw, the letter mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="foreign">; if this break be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a part of the letter, which is mo&s;t probable, then it may either be <GAP DESC="foreign">, or rather a double <GAP DESC="foreign">, with one face back|ward, as the double <GAP DESC="foreign"> is frequently expre&s;&s;ed upon Latin in&s;criptions. If this be admitted, the word will be Tirrio, probably for Tyrio; and the whole may then, as I apprehend, be tran&s;lated as in the reading.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Several ancient writers take notice of the peculiar regard and wor|&s;hip paid to Hercules by the Tyrians. Arrian &s;ays his temple in that city was the olde&s;t upon record. Diodora the Arch-prie&s;te&s;s, men|tioned in this in&s;cription, might perhaps be devoted to his &s;ervice. That this was an office of great dignity, and not below per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, appears from another in&s;cription, produced by Mont|faucon, which is, <HI>"Caracylaea Arch prie&s;te&s;s de&s;cended from Kings."</HI> We have likewi&s;e an in&s;cription in the Marmora Oxonien&s;is, where one Aurelia Fau&s;ta has this title given her: that in&s;cription having been erected at Smyrna, the learned Editor &s;uppo&s;es the Lady was Arch-prie&s;te&s;s to Diana; and among other rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns this, becau&s;e Prie&s;te&s;s mini&s;tered only to female Deities. Now if this ob&s;ervation was univer&s;ally true, it would de&s;troy the &s;uppo&s;ition above men|tioned, relating to Diodora. But there is an in&s;cription in Gruter, ATERIA SACER &mdash; DATIS PA&mdash;, which I think can mean no|thing el&s;e but <HI>Ateria Prie&s;te&s;s of Pluto.</HI> And Pau&s;anias &s;ays expre&s;sly, that it was cu&s;tomary for a virgin to officiate as Prie&s;te&s;s in the tem|ple of Neptune, in Calaurea. It appears therefore, by the&s;e in|&s;tances, that women were not wholly excluded from the prie&s;thood of male Deities. Caracylaea, in the in&s;cription of Montfaucon, is &s;aid pre&s;ently after to have been wife to C. Julius Severus; the &s;ame, as
<PB N="165" REF="199">
Montfaucon thinks, who, according to the Fa&s;ti Con&s;ulares, was Con|&s;ul in the year 155. And why may we not &s;uppo&s;e that Diodora was married to &s;ome commander of the Roman forces, who brought her hither, where &s;he erected this altar, in honour of the Deity to who&s;e &s;ervice &s;he had been particularly devoted? And the like may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to other Grecian Deities, who&s;e altars are found here in Britain, (as Jupiter Dolichenus and Dea Syria) which might be &s;et up by per&s;ons originally of tho&s;e countries where the&s;e Deities were more particularly wor&s;hipped.</Q></P>
<P>The other altar is dedicated to A&s;tarte,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A&s;tarte was the &s;ymbol of the moon, being wor&s;hipped by moon-light in open temples and groves, fir&s;t with pure and afterwards with impure rights.

<P>The ob&s;ervations made on this altar in the 1&s;t volume of the Archeologis, by the Rev. Dr Pettingal and Dr Adee, may al&s;o be agreeable to the reader in this place.</P>
<P><Q>The per&s;on who communicated this in&s;cription to the Society a few years ago informed us, that it was found about Corbridge, <HI>near the wall,</HI> where, as there were many Roman Legions, particularly the Legio Secunda Augu&s;ta &amp; Vice&s;ima Victrix, ordered thither, the fir&s;t from I&s;ca Silurum, the other from Deva, or Che&s;ter, in order to keep the wall in order and defend it, we can make no doubt of its being Roman, notwith&s;tanding it is written in Greek charac|ters; for this manner of writing in&s;criptions was an affectation frequently to be met with in the lower Empire, or after the time of Con&s;tantine; and was &s;ometimes carried &s;o far, that when the language was entirely Latin, the character was Greek, and vice ver&s;a, examples of which are to be found in Fabretti In&s;crip. p. 390 and 465.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I read the fir&s;t word ACITHC, which I &s;uppo&s;e relative to the collective body of Ala Prima A&s;torum, of which we read, the fir&s;t was &s;tationed at <HI>Condurco,</HI> the la&s;t at Cilurno per Lineam Valli. Condurco is called by Mr Camden, Che&s;ter-le-&s;treet, and Cilurno, Walwick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e A&s;ti, we are told in the Notitia, came from A&s;ta, Colonia Ligurum, now A&s;ti in Piedmont: the portion of lands that in the Agrarian divi&s;ion fell to the A&s;ti, lay hereabouts. I mention this, becau&s;e it may perhaps throw light upon the particular &Bgr;&OHgr;&Mgr;&Ogr;&Ngr; &Mgr;&Egr;&Slungr;&Ogr;&Rgr;, which I am inclined to think &s;tands for <GAP DESC="foreign">; from whence it will appear, that this monumental altar was al&s;o an Ara Terminalis; for <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies a boundary between lands of different property; and perhaps here, between the allotments of the different companies of the &s;oldiers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The word <GAP DESC="foreign"> does not &s;tand here, in a religious &s;en&s;e, for an altar whereon they were to &s;acrifice or make libations to any God, but &s;ignified the &s;ame as Ara in the Latin in&s;crip|tions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What was the u&s;e of this <GAP DESC="foreign"> when it was <GAP DESC="foreign">, and erected on the bounds of lands, we may learn from the Agrarian laws; the placing them on the bounds of their lands, or mili|tary a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ments as meers or bounds, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> property; for which rea&s;on they are called by Dolobella.

<P>This altar, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;cribed by the Prie&s;t, is attributed to a Marine Legion, rai&s;ed by Hadrian in Syria, called the Ulpian Legion: which followed Carau&s;ius in the time of Maximian.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following &s;hort Anecdotes of Carau&s;ius may not be di&s;agreeable:</P>
<P>The Emperor Carau&s;ius is repre&s;ented as a graceful per&s;on. He was de&s;cended of Briti&s;h parents. The Briti&s;h Empire by &s;ea is attributed to him. Con&s;tantine in&s;tituted the office of Comes Litoris Saxonici, which Carau&s;ius filled with immortal honour; the Saxons in that age &s;ending forth a &s;et of daring pirates, who di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h coa&s;t. Under Maximian he held the office of Admiral of the Roman navy. He advanced to &s;uch a height in the e&s;teem of the people, that he was induced to throw off the Roman authority, and a&s;&s;ume the Imperial power in Britain. Maximian, with the whole naval force of Rome, approached the Briti&s;h coa&s;t to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his temerity, and his a&s;&s;ociates for their defection. He with&s;tood them near the I&s;le of Wight with the Briti&s;h navy: he &s;ought and conquered; and from that time held the &s;upreme authority independent of Rome, &s;uperior to all its power. But &s;uch is the precariou&s;|ne&s;s of human glory, &s;uch the in&s;tability of &s;ublunary things, this hero fell by the hands of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, in his palace at York; &s;lain by the traiterous &s;word of an in&s;iduous wretch, under the &s;pecious character of a friend.&mdash;There is not in human life a more happy acqui&s;ition than a friend, where we can find "the feculence of fal&s;hood long thrown down," giving all the mind to benevolence and genero&s;ity: but on the other hand, there is not &s;o pernicious an enemy, as he who, under a &s;pecious character, in&s;inuates him&s;elf into the bo&s;om of a generous and open|minded man, and there, like Milton's toad, "poi&s;oning the animal &s;pirits," carries on the operations of the Devil. If the regions of the damned are permitted to &s;end forth the tribes of Lucifer to torment mankind, tho&s;e of &s;uperior diabolic and infernal talents, mu&s;t take upon them this mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of helli&s;h characters.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>Dr Todd, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, &s;uppo&s;es the name to have been originally Herculce&s;ter, i. e. Ca&s;tra Herculis. What led him to this opinion, is the altar with the Greek in&s;cription dedicated to the Tyrian Hercules. Mr Hor&s;ley was of opinion, <Q>that as Cor&s;topidum had been generally, &s;o it is very ju&s;tly, placed at the &s;tation near Cor|bridge. This place has generally been taken for Ptolomy's Curia Ota|denorum, becau&s;e there &s;eems to be &s;ome affinity between the names, and becau&s;e the Otadini mu&s;t certainly be placed hereabouts;</Q> but he differs in opinion concerning this matter, and concludes that Cor&s;to|pidum and Curia were different names, and altogether different places.</P>
<P>The Ermin-&s;treet way, having cro&s;&s;ed the Tyne, proceeds towards Ebche&s;ter, in the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, and continues its cour&s;e almo&s;t in a meridian line to Dover, in Kent, as may be &s;een in Antoninus's Itinerary. Another military way pa&s;&s;es from this place &s;outh-we&s;t through Dil&s;ton Park, over Hexham Fell, to Old Town, in Alondale, and meets with the Maiden Way at Whitley Ca&s;tle, as is &s;et out in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland.</P>
<P>The Romans were excellent architects, and by all the de&s;criptions given of their bridges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;actions.</NOTE> in Britain, te&s;tified their geometrical knowledge: their arch was &s;emicircular, their pillars multangular, with a &s;harp angle to the &s;tream, like the prow of a &s;hip. The foundations of the piers were con&s;tructed of an horizontal arch made of &s;tones, in the form of a wedge, as appears by the remains here. In &s;ituations &s;ubject
<PB N="169" REF="204">
to rapid floods, a &s;mall arch was formed in the pier, to receive the water when it began to reach the bow of the arch.</P>
<P>Many Roman Antiques have been found here; &s;uch as coins, &s;eals, &amp;c. but mo&s;t of them of the lower Empire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Many Seals of Roman work were found at Corche&s;ter: Greek and Roman Antiques were always of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip; engravings on gems, pebbles, and &s;tones, of the fir&s;t order for beauty and lu&s;ter. The beril, the chalcedony, the emerald, hyacinth, the topaz or modern chry&s;olite, and the garnet, were favourites. The chry&s;tal pebble and the amathy&s;t were al&s;o e&s;teemed. They al&s;o u&s;ed the onyx, the &s;ardonyx, the agate onyx, the ja&s;per, the haemachates or blood-&s;tone, which they valued for cameos. Other kinds were not u&s;ed by the Romans till the lower Empire, when the arts were upon the decline: then camelians and &s;tones of an inferior cla&s;s were introduced. Of this order and &s;pecies are the intaglios found at our Roman Stations. The Greek ma&s;ters excelled the Romans in the art of &s;culpture and en|graving; who re&s;igned their genius more to oeconomical and political refinements.</P>

<P>In Mr Hor&s;ley's Works we have the following in&s;criptions and &s;culptures:</P>
<P>No. C. Imperatori&mdash;Marco Aurelio Antonino tribunitiae pote&s;tatis.</P>
<P>This is in the fore wall of a hou&s;e in Corbridge, on the right hand as you enter the village from the ea&s;t: it has no doubt been a curious in&s;cription, and is twice taken notice of in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, by Dr Hunter and Dr Todd. I do not under&s;tand Dr Todd's ac|count, who &s;ays, <Q>there I &s;aw altars in&s;cribed, one Imp. M. Aurelio&mdash;another Leg. II. Aug. Coh. IIII.</Q> But this and the following &s;tone which he refers to, are honorary monuments, not altars, and neither of the in&s;criptions are exactly repre&s;ented, as appers from the copies I have given, which are taken from the originals. This &s;tone is broken both on the left &s;ide and at the bottom; &s;o that although the in&s;cription belongs to one of the Antoninus's, yet whe|ther to Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, or Caracalla, may be a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>CI. Legionis Secundae Augu&s;tae, Cohors Quarta Fecit.</P>
<P>This is in the church wall, and no doubt mu&s;t be the &s;ame with that which Dr Todd men|tions. It is of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e which have frequently been erected by the Legions and legionary Cohorts, when they were employed in building any work, and, I believe, u&s;ually &s;et in the face of it. The O and H are imperfect, part of the upper &s;tratum of the &s;tone being gone off.</P>
<P>CII. <Q>BISI&mdash; &mdash;VAL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This in&s;cription is more imperfect than either of the former: it is broken at the top, and at one end, and is now fixed in the corner of a hou&s;e in the town The letters which remain are very fair, but one cannot tell how much is wanting. I was told that this &s;tone was found not many years ago, and that there were more letters upon it when di&s;covered, which were after|wards broken off by the workmen, when they put it into the wall. If we &s;uppo&s;e the word in the lower line to have been Vallum or Valli. and C is in the preceding line, to have expre&s;&s;ed the number of paces, we have &s;till more rea&s;on to regret the lo&s;s of the re&s;t of it. I could not be &s;ure that the la&s;t imperfect &s;troke was the top of an I, though the &s;ituation of it &s;o high makes it probable. The leaf before the word Val does not favour the antiquity of it.</P>
<P>CIII. The &s;culpture repre&s;ented, is in the front of an old hou&s;e. The victory is curious and entire, being winged, with the u&s;ual drapery and attitude. What &s;he takes hold of, &s;eems to have been the ornamental part of a &s;tone, on which there has been an in&s;cription. The only peculiarity is, that &s;he &s;eems to &s;et each foot on a ball or globe.</P>
<P>CIV. The le&s;&s;er of the&s;e &s;tones is in the jamb of a door, and the larger lies at the door of another hou&s;e in the town. The people call this latter a hor&s;e. I have placed them both under the &s;ame number, as believing them to be of the &s;ame kind. The latter appears to be a lion, with &s;ome other animals under him, the head of which is broken off. In the other, the heads of both animals are gone. The lion does not &s;eem to be devouring or de&s;troying the other ani|mal, but rather de&s;ending it, and I believe it is of the &s;ame nature with the &s;culpture at Wal|w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck Grange. The larger of the&s;e figures is very coar&s;e, and much defaced.</P>
<P>CV. The market cro&s;s &s;tands on an altar, on which there has been an in&s;cription, but now defaced. On the &s;ides of the altar are the figures de&s;cribed below. They were half covered under the ground, or under the &s;teps of the cro&s;s; but the earth and &s;teps being removed, they appeared at full length, and are pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly two human figures; in one hand of each nothing can be di&s;covered.

He looks upon them as the mementos of days of di&s;tre&s;s, when every man formed his great|ne&s;s, by the number of fellow-creatures he could harne&s;s, to mini&s;ter to his pride, and contribute to his crimes: as dens of &s;avages, and ani|mals of prey, who, like the wolves of the fore&s;t, held warfare with all the creatures of the earth; and wor&s;e than wolves, employed the powers of rationality to render them more rapacious, more cruel, and more blood-thir&s;ty than mere animal in&s;tinct could in&s;inuate to the heart: even cruelty, blood-thir&s;tine&s;s, and rapacity again&s;t their fellow-creatures, of which wolves are not accu&s;ed. He looks upon them as monuments of &s;epultured oppre&s;&s;ion, over which the olives of peace are woven by the hand of liberty.

<P>where lays the mo&s;t picture&s;que, though confined land&s;kip, the whole county of Northumberland exhibits. We a&s;cended to the brink of the precipice, near 200 feet high, from whence we looked down upon a &s;e|que&s;tered vale, almo&s;s in&s;ulated by the brook, con&s;i&s;ting of a fine level plot of corn land, of about eight acres, in the exact form of a hor&s;e|&s;hoe; the brook pa&s;&s;ing over a rugged rocky bottom, under the &s;hadow of lofty hills, in various broken &s;treams was &s;een on each hand, foam|ing from fall to fall, which gave a beautiful contra&s;t to the deep hue of the groves. From the brook, the hills to the left ari&s;e precipitous, cloathed with a fine hanging wood, then glowing with a full &s;un&s;hine; to the right, the &s;teeps laying from the &s;un, and in the deep &s;hade, were broken, and &s;cattered over in wild irregularity with bru&s;hwood, and here and there a grote&s;que and knotty tree pre&s;ented it&s;elf impend|ing from the precipice; in front, a fine eminence of brown rock lifted its rugged brow, and clo&s;ed the circle, dividing the waters with a pro|montory a few yards wide. In the clefts, and on the little levels of the rock, &s;ome &s;hrubs grow; on its crown &s;tood ripened corn, margined with hedge-row trees, through which a cottage was di&s;covered; and by its foot, a winding road &s;oon e&s;caped the eye in intercepting woods: the rays of light fell happily upon the cliffs, and brightened their co|louring. To the right and left, the more di&s;tant brook &s;hewed it&s;elf in

deep and rocky dells, embowered by lofty oaks. To the right hand, the hill which &s;urmounts the wood, is topped with a plain of gra&s;s ground, on who&s;e brink &s;tands a farmhold, acce&s;&s;able by a narrow path winding up the &s;teep, from whence the woods make a beautiful curvi|ture: the di&s;tant back ground is compo&s;ed of heath lands. On the left, woodlands were &s;een on the circus, winding on the mazy channel of the brook, here and there intercepted by heathy eminences; the back ground very di&s;tant, and tinged with a mi&s;ty azure. To grace the little enchanted vale, reapers were bu&s;y with the harve&s;t: in &s;ome parts the furrows looked like waving gold; in others they were embo&s;&s;ed with up&s;et &s;heafs. This is the fine&s;t natural theatre I ever &s;aw; the circle is almo&s;t geometrically ju&s;t; the plain would have &s;uited tho&s;e exhibitions, of which we read, with an anxious curio&s;ity, in the hi&s;tories of the An|cients; they would have given it life, taken away the ru&s;ticity, and made it noble.

<P>Camden &s;ays Ri&s;ingham implies the Giants habitation. It is remark|able, that in the darkne&s;s of antiquity, we find innumerable traditions of powerful per&s;ons, and mighty atchievements, under the characters of Giants; which at this time, according to Mr Bryant's mo&s;t excellent work, denote &s;ome great temple, the character of &s;ome powerful people, &s;ome mighty Ruler, or mi&s;erable Tyrant. Camden relates, that the inhabitants in his time had a traditional tale of the God Magon, who defended him&s;elf here, and maintained his fortre&s;s again&s;t a certain Sol|dain or Heathen Prince. This relation, he &s;ays, is authenticated, as to the reality of &s;uch a per&s;onage as Magon, in the ages of antiquity, by two Roman in&s;criptions found in the river there. From our utmo&s;t endea|vours, we could not trace any remembrance, legendary tale, or heroic &s;ong, touching &s;uch per&s;on as Magon, now remaining.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t leave the Roman line, and attend to more remote antiquity, to define, if po&s;&s;ible, the name of Magon. I pre&s;ume Mr Bryant has thrown &s;uch happy lights upon the ancient mythology, and has proved his principles by &s;uch te&s;timonies, that with implicit confidence I may adopt his maxims. I &s;hall have &s;everal occa&s;ions to re&s;ort to his work, in the progre&s;s of my journey through the mountainous part of this county, for etymologies of tho&s;e ancient names, which without his di|rections I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed over as incomprehen&s;ible; and &s;o lo&s;t in the mi&s;ts of antiquity, as to remain without &s;olution.&mdash;As it is little doubted, fire-wor&s;hip was once the accepted religion of this i&s;land, in|troduced by ea&s;tern vi&s;itants, and profe&s;&s;ed and practi&s;ed by the Druids; in the&s;e wild and uncultivated parts, it is mo&s;t probable, the &s;tronge&s;t evidence thereof would remain to this age. I find in Mr Bryant's ra|dicals, as he terms them, that the word &OHgr;&mdash;ON, was one of the titles
<PB N="183" REF="218">
of the Sun among the Amonians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. xli. ver. 45. Exod. chap. i. ver. 13.</NOTE> and was often in combination with other epithets, u&s;ed by the Syrians, Cretans, and Canaanites. He al&s;o therein &s;peaks of the word Macar, as a &s;acred title given by the Amonians to their Deity, and was frequently compounded Macar&mdash;on: from whence a people were donominated <GAP DESC="foreign">, Macarones, and places were called <GAP DESC="foreign">, Macron. The corruption of a name, received from the pronunciation of unlettered and ignorant inhabitants, who had handed it down traditionally for ages, is not to be wondered at; from Macron to Magon is a &s;imple and ea&s;y corruption. From the in|accuracy of the&s;e rude in&s;criptions (as appears in the &s;econd, even in the name of the invoked Deity) it is not to be wondered that G took place of CR; or from the obliterations in them through age and time, the tran&s;criber might mi&s;take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for G, a &s;mall letter being frequently introduced in the middle of a word. Take Mr Bryant's arguments on traditions of the like nature, and the whole relation given by Camden is re&s;olved into an hi&s;toric fact&mdash;that the wor&s;hippers and prie&s;ts of <HI>On,</HI> who held here their religious rites, in the temple of the Sun, were a formidable &s;ociety, powerful in their numbers and their learning.</P>
<P>That the ea&s;tern religion and rites were introduced to this i&s;land is certain; that the Romans, in many in&s;tances, are known to have adop|ted the topical Gods; they al&s;o, from an error in etymology, gave to per&s;ons, names which were relative to places; and when in Britain, they either introduced their own manner of wor&s;hip, or otherwi&s;e adopted the Briti&s;h Deities, or rather the Amonian titles which they found there, and gave them per&s;ons as Divinities. To prove this, I &s;hall quote the in&s;cription before &s;poken of, in the Cottonian collection, found at Great Che&s;ters (page 35) <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bryant.</NOTE> Sur being a title of the Sun, <Q>Syria being deno|minated from thence, is at this day called Souria, from Sur and Sehor, the Sun. That Suria was not merely a provincial title, is plain, from the Surya Dea being wor&s;hipped at Eryx, in Sicily, and from an in&s;cription to her at Rome.</Q></P>
<P>The Romans had an aver&s;ion to the Druids, who &s;uffered no idols to be &s;et up: they took infinite pains to extirpate them, and de&s;troy their monuments. Here then we find the remainder of Camden's tradition, that the prie&s;ts of On, the wor&s;hippers of the Sun at Ri&s;ingham, long with&s;tood the Roman arms: to pacify the people, and incite them to
<PB N="184" REF="219">
mix in their wor&s;hip, the Romans erected their Altars on the &s;acred mount, and in&s;cribed them with the Amonian titles.</P>
<P>If I may be allowed to make another conjecture, that the topical Deities to whom the&s;e altars were dedicated, prove the wor&s;hippers of the <HI>Sun</HI> held here the <HI>Amonian Rites,</HI> and that from thence was derived the tradition mentioned by Camden, I would pre&s;ume this latter in|&s;cription was either incorrectly copied, having in the original an A and M mixed thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or the fir&s;t letter in the name of the Deity was omit|ted by the Sculptor, or intentionally neglected by the Dedicator, as ap|pears in many other in&s;tances; and that properly it &s;hould have been AMOUNO: <HI>Amoun</HI> being a Grecian mode of expre&s;&s;ing AMON. I have before &s;hewn, from Mr <HI>Hor&s;ley's</HI> authorities, that the Grecian expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed in many Roman in&s;criptions yet extant. This altar would then appear to be dedicated to <HI>Ammon,</HI> the topical Deity of <HI>Ri&s;ingham,</HI> at the time of the acce&s;&s;ion of the Romans. For the &s;ake of impartiality, it it is nece&s;&s;ary to admit, that the dedication to <HI>Ammon</HI> might be from Grecian auxiliaries; as <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, <Q>that of all the Egyptian names which &s;eemed to have corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Zeus</HI> of Greece, <HI>Amoun</HI> or <HI>Ammon</HI> was the mo&s;t peculiar and adequate.</Q> And from <HI>Herodotus</HI> we learn, that <Q>almo&s;t all the names of the Gods in Greece were ad|ventitious, having been brought thither from Egypt.</Q></P>
<P>Camden &s;ays, &s;o much we may gather from the&s;e in&s;criptions, as to a&s;certain the name of the place <HI>Habitancum,</HI> and that he who made the fir&s;t in&s;cription was <HI>Beneficiarius</HI> to a Con&s;ul, and Primate of the place. The <HI>Beneficiarius</HI> was either by promotion, or ari&s;ing from exemption of military &s;ervice by di&s;pen&s;ation: they attended the chief officers of the army: they &s;eem to have been &s;omewhat like tho&s;e we now call <HI>Cadets:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;ley.</NOTE> and the <HI>Primaes,</HI> as appears by the <HI>Codex Theodo&s;ii,</HI> were chief magi&s;trates of cities, towns, or ca&s;tles. Camden leaves us in the dark as to <HI>Magon,</HI> not even determining whether he was e&s;teemed the tutelar God of the <HI>Gadeni,</HI> whom Ptolomy placed next the <HI>Ottodini.</HI></P>

The word Dolocheno is very plain upon this in&s;cription; but in all other in|&s;criptions, and writers who mention this Deity, the name is &s;pelt with an I or Y in the &s;econd &s;yllable; excepting one, which though it be &s;o likewi&s;e in <HI>Gruter,</HI> yet in <HI>Petrus Apianus,</HI> who had publi&s;hed it before, it is writ, as <HI>Montfaucon</HI> ob&s;erves, with an O, in the &s;econd &s;yllable, like this. Po&s;&s;ibly the letters PVBL, in the &s;econd line, may not be another name of the per&s;on, but &s;tand for Publitia, the name of the tribe to which this <HI>Caius Julius</HI> belonged. This tribe is often mentioned in <HI>Gruter.</HI></Q> As to the Divinity Dolochenus, I &s;hall have

occa&s;ion to quote Mr Hor&s;ley very fully on an in&s;cription which occurs at Benwell.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides the &s;culptures and in&s;criptions here noticed, in Mr Hor&s;ley's work we find the following, appertaining to this &s;tation.</P>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. Marti Victori Julius Publius Pius Tribunus votum &s;olvit libens merito.</P>
<P>This Mr Hor&s;ley &s;ays remains at the &s;tation (though I could not di&s;cover it, and pre&s;ume it has been moved &s;ince his time). There are effigies of Mars and Victory on the capital, and an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s head on the ba&s;e of the altar. Mars has his u&s;ual dre&s;s and &s;ymbols, a &s;hield in his left hand, and a &s;pear in his right. The Victory in her u&s;ual drapery, holds a globe in her right hand, and a palm branch in her left. The figures and in&s;cription Marti Victori explain and illu&s;trate each other.</P>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. Militum cui praee&s;t Marcus Peregrinus Super&s;tes Tribunus.</P>
<P>The original I found placed for a &s;eat, at the back door of a hou&s;e at Che&s;terhope. The fir&s;t word may have been Militum, and the other letter a C. in CVI: and as the Cohors Prima Tungtorum, has Militum annexed, I once &s;u&s;pected that this altar rather belonged to the Tun|grian, than the Vangiones, from the in&s;criptions at the Hou&s;e-&s;teads, in one of which we al&s;o meet with the name Super&s;tis. The altar is of a hard reddi&s;h &s;tone, but finer than u&s;ual.</P>
<P N="89">LXXXIX. &mdash;Cui praee&s;t Nonnuis Aurelius Ca&s;tus Vetu&s;tate. Conlabium.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the broken in&s;cription given in Camden, and before mentioned. It is very evident, it was erected on the repairing or rebuilding &s;ome public edifice, that through age had gone to ruin: for &s;o much does the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion Vetu&s;tate Conlab&s;um imply. Aurelius Ca&s;tus &s;eems to have been the name of the Prae&s;ect: but what Cohort he commanded, that was im|ployed in this work, is not to be known by the in&s;cription. I can imagine no re&s;emblance be|tween the fir&s;t letters in the in&s;cription, and tho&s;e in Gallorum or Vangionum, and yet there is no evidence from any in&s;cription, of any other Cohort being there. The N in the word Con|lab&s;um, is &s;ilent, as it often is in the middle of a word, before another con&s;onant; and &s;o is frequently omitted by the workmen, who u&s;ually wrote as they were accu&s;tomed to pronounce.</P>

<P>Of which little more can be known, than, that it has been &s;epulchral.</P>
<P N="92">XCII. There is nothing more worth our notice within the &s;tation, but the following &s;culp|ture. Three human figures are on one &s;ide, and a man holding a hor&s;e on the other &s;ide of the &s;ame &s;tone, which is of a cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ical form: the&s;e figures are much effaced. The man, who holds the hor&s;e on his left hand, appears to be in &s;omewhat like an Armenian dre&s;s, with a ha&s;ta in his other hand. Two of the other figures are leaning upon pillars, one of which has a &s;taff in his right hand, with two &s;erpents twi&s;ted about it, the &s;ymbol of <HI>E&s;culapius,</HI> who&s;e image I take it to be. And the &s;hort figure which &s;tands next, exactly agrees to <HI>Tele&s;phorus,</HI> the God of Recovery, who is always repre&s;ented in this manner, with a cloak covering both his arms; and is often placed between <HI>E&s;culapius</HI> and his daughter <HI>Hygicia,</HI> and &s;ometimes &s;tanding by <HI>E&s;culapius</HI> alone: in both ca&s;es he appears like a boy. He &s;tands with <HI>E&s;culapius</HI> alone in a medal of <HI>Caraca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI> and between him and <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gieia</HI> in the medals of <HI>Lucius Verus</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> the younger, as al&s;o in a &s;culpture of Montfaucon. The God and Godde&s;s of Phy&s;ick and Health, and the God of Recovery, are proper companions one of another. The third figure here may be <HI>Hygieta,</HI> with the cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thus about her head; the drapery is very doubtful, and the &s;erpent, her u&s;ual &s;ymbol, does not appear, in which the &s;culpture agrees with that of Montfaucon. A man holding a hor&s;e, may be an emblem of victory, peace, or &s;ecurity. In a medal of <HI>Commodus</HI> with <HI>Fortunae mane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> on the rever&s;e. <HI>Fortune</HI> &s;its holding a hor&s;e by the bridle. There is &s;o great a re&s;emblace between this fourth figure and that of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> upon &s;ome coins, that it has created an opinion in me, that it may have been intended for <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> or <HI>Geta,</HI> under that figure, holding his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> in his hand.

The figure here indeed, holds the &s;pear in his right hand, and the hor&s;e in his left; but that is no material difference. <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> is u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed from his brother by a hor&s;e, according to Horace.</P>
<Q><L>Ca&s;tor gaudet equis, ovo prognatus eodem</L>
<L>Pugnis.</L></Q>
<P>But <HI>Montfaucon</HI> has given us a &s;culpture of Ca&s;tor and Pollux together, each holding a hor&s;e and a &s;pear.</P>
<P>Two in&s;criptions in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland, who&s;e originals I could not find, are thus repre&s;ented:

I &s;uppo&s;e this has been an altar. The E at the end of the fir&s;t line I fancy has been overlooked. The copy of the other is more confu&s;ed and unintelligible. All we can a&s;certain is, it has been dedicated Marti Victori.</P>

It has a Praefericulum and Patera on one &s;ide, and a garland on the other. There has no doubt been an in&s;cription upon it, though now not the lea&s;t &s;ign of a letter appears. I think this cannot well be the &s;ame altar, which with the in&s;cription upon it, Dr Hunter has de&s;cribed in the Phi|lo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions; for the Doctor &s;ays he found that near Rieche&s;ter.

The Emperors, in honour of whom it has been erected, I take to be <HI>Severus and Caracalla,</HI> who were much hereabout, and, I believe, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this very &s;tation. This Cohort &s;eems to have been like a flying &s;quadron, for by in&s;criptions we find them in &s;everal places. The in&s;cription is included in a kind of <HI>corona,</HI> or rather an octagon, circum&s;cribed by a &s;quare moulding. There are ornaments of eagles heads on each &s;ide, above which is the appear|ance of two faces, probably de&s;igned for tho&s;e of the Emperors re|ferred to by the in&s;cription. Mars and Victory, in their u&s;ual dre&s;s and appearance, are &s;et in a nich, one at each end of the &s;tone. The other ornaments &s;eem only to be &s;uch as plea&s;ed the fancy of the Sculp|tor.

The original is now at Conington. The rudene&s;s of the letters, the &s;cattered po&s;ition of them, and the &s;tops on each &s;ide the I, in the la&s;t line but one, are very remarkable. Though DM be at the top, yet it is not an altar, of which there are other in&s;tances.</Q></P>

<P>This &s;tation was certainly gone to decay before the reign of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> and afterwards was re&s;tored: and this opinion is favoured by the la&s;t

imperfect in&s;cription, found at this place; from whence it appears, that &s;omewhat had been repaired which had gone to ruin through age.</P>
<P>The remarkable effigy of <HI>Robin of Ri&s;ingham,</HI> as it is called by the country people, next claims my attention: I will in the fir&s;t place give Mr Hor&s;ley's de&s;cription, and then offer &s;ome few remarks of my own. <Q>The remarkable figure which u&s;ually goes by the name of <HI>Robin of Ri&s;inghom,</HI> or <HI>Robin of Red&s;dale,</HI> is cut upon the face of a huge piece of rock, that has fallen off from the main one. It is on the &s;ide of a hill or rock near the park head, and about half a mile from the &s;ta|tion at Ri&s;ingham. The image is in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> and both the &s;culp|ture and &s;tone very coar&s;e. I take it, by the drapery and &s;ymbols, to be certainly Roman, though &s;ome, from the rudene&s;s of the &s;culp|ture, have thought it Briti&s;h: and probably it is the Emperor <HI>Commo|dus,</HI> repre&s;ented under the figure of <HI>Hercules.</HI> The &s;quare &s;tone be&s;ide him, mu&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e be an altar, and what he carries in his left arm a club: on his left &s;houlder are di&s;tinctly &s;een a quiver and arrows, and in his right hand a bow, which agree with the character given him by <HI>Herodian,</HI> who celebrates him as a mo&s;t excellent archer. What he wears on his head looks like a helmet. Every body knows that <HI>Commodus</HI> affected to be called the <HI>Roman Hercules,</HI> and to be wor|&s;hipped as &s;uch. We have his coins with <HI>Herculi Romano Augu&s;to, Herculi Romano Conditori,</HI> &amp;c. This figure then might repre&s;ent the Roman <HI>Hercules</HI> triumphant and victorious, after things had been &s;et|tled in Britain by <HI>Pertinax,</HI> and <HI>Commodus</HI> a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Brit|tanicus.</HI> The face of the whole piece of rock on which the image is cut, is an irregular figure of five &s;ides: the &s;ide which re&s;ts in the ground is &s;ix feet and an half; the perpendicular from the <HI>vertex</HI> to this &s;ide, eight feet; the two &s;ides to the right of this perpendicular each of them five feet; the uppermo&s;t &s;ide to the left &s;even; and the lower four; and the &s;tone is ju&s;t about &s;ix feet thick. The figure &s;tands upright.</Q></P>
<P>The doubts which I entertain that this is Roman work, are founded upon the following circum&s;tances: The ve&s;t in which the figure is ha|bited is open from the wai&s;t to the knee; round the wai&s;t is a belt buckled before: the loo&s;e garment on the &s;houlders, leaving the right arm bare and at liberty, is put on in the manner of the Scotch plaid: the cap is not &s;imilar to any one I remember to have &s;een in Roman &s;culptures: the bow is in the right hand. But that the reader may pa&s;s his own judgment upon this &s;culpture, I have given an etching of it.</P>

This particularly is thought to have been done with relation to <HI>Geta,</HI> by the order of his brother <HI>Caracalla,</HI> in &s;ome other in&s;criptions in Britain; though I cannot think that the name of <HI>Geta</HI> has been upon this altar; for this neither agrees with the letter C, yet very plain and vi&s;ible, nor with the &s;equel of the in&s;cription, which is very clear and di&s;tinct. <HI>Bono generis Humani Imperante Calparato Agric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la Legato Augu&s;tali Propraetore po&s;uit ac dedicavit C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Acilius.</HI> The fir&s;t words in the filth line are undoubtedly <HI>Augu&s;tali Propraetore,</HI> which makes it certain, that <HI>Legato,</HI> and the name of the Lieutenant, have gone before, ac|cording to the u&s;ual form. If we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Calparuius Agricola</HI> to be the name that has been de&s;ignedly era&s;ed. I believe that as the letters will exactly fill up the empty &s;pace, &s;o that &s;up|ply will &s;uit very well, both with what goes before and what follows. <HI>Imperante Calpurnio Agricola,</HI> I take to be the &s;ame with <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Calpurnio Agricola,</HI> or perhaps <HI>fu&s;&s;u Calpurnii Agricola,</HI> which &s;o frequently occurs in &s;uch &s;ort of &s;ub&s;criptions. There is &s;ome difficulty in forming a notion of the meaning of an altar erected <HI>Bono generis humani;</HI> but this may &s;eem as intelligible as an altar erected <HI>Bono &s;ato, Bono event<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI> &amp;c. and perhaps has much the &s;ame meaning. There are coins with <HI>Salus Generis humani</HI> upon them. If the conjecture concerning <HI>Calpurnius Agri|cola</HI> be admitted, it will then follow, that this in&s;cription belongs to the time of <HI>M. Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> who&s;e Legate this <HI>Agricola</HI> was; and con&s;equently that the Romans were in his time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;tation.</P>
<P>Having given my own &s;entiments of this in&s;cription, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that a different conjecture has occurred, which &s;everal of my friends incline to prefer: and that is, that the following fragment and this may have been originally but one &s;tone, and that the whole in|&s;cription has run thus:
<Q><L>DEO MATVNO</L>

<P>I was obliged to be from home two or three days after the receipt of yours, which has oc|ca&s;ioned the delay, for a po&s;t or two, in my communicating to you a di&s;covery that has lately been made in the grounds of <HI>Otterburn,</HI> in this county.</P>
<P>There was a large <HI>Cairn</HI> of &s;tones, computed to about 60 ton, which they had occa&s;ion to lead off; when the &s;tones were removed, they di&s;covered at the bottom, a large &s;tone, rough and undre&s;&s;ed, la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon the ground, in form of a grave-&s;tone, with &s;maller &s;tones wedged in between it and the ground, wherever there were any inter&s;tices.

<P>The di&s;turbances in England in the time of King Richard II. induced the Scots to invade the borders, in the 12th year of that reign, with about 3000 men, under the command of Sir William Douglas, by &s;ome authors &s;tiled Earl Douglas. They were attacked in their camp on the 5th of Augu&s;t. 1388, by a body of Engli&s;h forces, commanded by the Earl of Northumberland, and his two &s;ons, Henry Percy and Ralph Percy, young men of martial &s;pirit, at Otterburn.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">path's B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rder Hi&s;tory&punc; "An army almo&s;t thrice as numerous as that of the Scots."&mdash; I know not by what authority this is a&s;&s;erted.</NOTE></P>

Percy, who for his intrepidity and martial prowe&s;s was &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur. He met him in the hotte&s;t of the battle, in&s;olently braved the young hero to engage, and Douglas fell beneath his valorous &s;word. The ru|mour of their leader's overthrow ran through the Scotti&s;h lines; they were intimidated, and began to fly; but at the in&s;tant the panic was becoming general, and the Engli&s;h were advancing in hopes of victory, the Earl of Dunbar came up with a large reinforcement, and the Scots rallied. Now overpowered by numbers, and faint with the fatigues and blood&s;hed of the fight, the Engli&s;h gave way, and the invaders were victorious: yet &s;o powerfully, and with &s;uch gallant re&s;olution, did the Engli&s;h maintain the battle again&s;t &s;uperior force, that the lo&s;s on each &s;ide was &s;aid to be nearly equal. The Engli&s;h left 1800 dead upon the field. Among the pri&s;oners were Lord Percy and his brother, Sir Robert Heron, Sir Robert Ogle, Sir John Lilburn, Sir John Colwell, and many other valiant men of Northumberland.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance attended this day, as unfortunate to the Northum|brians, as &s;hameful to their allies: the Durham militia was approach|ing, but did not come up in time to &s;upport the Engli&s;h, before they had left the field to the victors: the Scotti&s;h leader not willing to hazard any more of his troops, thought it expedient to u&s;e &s;tratagem, and ac|cordingly a&s;&s;ailed the reinforcement in a mode totally new, and hap|pily prevalent: he cau&s;ed all his &s;oldiers to blow the horns which were u&s;ed to &s;ound an alarm; the &s;tilne&s;s of the night, the echo from the hills, and the terrors which the overthrow of the Northumbrians had impre&s;&s;ed upon their minds, wrought &s;o powerfully, that the militia were &s;eized with a panic, and put to flight without &s;eeing an enemy, vanqui&s;hed &s;olely by the tremendous idea of thou&s;ands approaching flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Replete with melancholy reflections, ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;cene and retro&s;pection, eight miles to Rieche&s;ter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s heavily; it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;entimental writer to catch the momentary ideas and living &s;entiments as they ri&s;e; the illu&s;trious names renewed to memory, by the place of Otterburn fight, the Percies, the Herons, Ogles, Lil|burns, and many more, bu&s;y on that famous night, brought upon my mind reflections on the honour of pedigree. Our ideas are apt to cla&s;s them&s;elves into compari&s;ons. Whil&s;t I ruminated on the &s;ubject of de|&s;cent from Heroes and illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, Men who had acquired Fame, Honour, and Title, by virtuous deeds and a &s;ervice of propriety,
<PB N="198" REF="233">
I determined that <HI>the Pride of Pedigree</HI> was laudable, &s;o long as the de|&s;cendant did not deba&s;e his blood by ignoble and impious actions. I admitted it as a maxim, that &s;uch had a right to public place, pre-eminence, and di&s;tinction. Then it was, I took (as it were) the other hand into con&s;ideration; a review of the modes of the world; and thence proceeded to compare my determined principles with characters well known to me. I remarked many who claimed place and di&s;tinc|tion, and &s;tand up as the givers of modes, and rulers of what &s;hall be called propriety of manners; &s;uch a groop of characters crowded upon me, (the mu&s;hrooms of a morning) all ru&s;hing with ardour and avari|ciou&s;ne&s;s of mind to the goal of pre-eminence, Wretches &s;prung from the filth of a corrupted age, that their mimick importance created in my mind &s;o ridiculous a picture, even amid&s;t the wa&s;tes and wilds where I travelled, and in defiance of all the deformities which nature &s;pread around me, I could not forbear laughter.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>28th December, 1732.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Mr Hor&s;ley's</HI> rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Cohors Prima Hi&s;panorum</HI> to have been part of the <HI>Ala Herculea,</HI> is their being quartered nearly together; the fir&s;t at <HI>Elenborough,</HI> and the other at <HI>Old Carli&s;le,</HI> as appears by in&s;criptions found at tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>I believe this Cohort arrived in Britain with the <HI>Emperor Hadrian,</HI> and continued there till the <HI>Romans</HI> quitted the <HI>i&s;land,</HI> and in a &s;eries of about 300 years, it mu&s;t have made &s;everal marches and counter marches from one camp to another. My rea&s;on for thinking it came hither with that Emperor, is from its appellation <HI>Aelia,</HI> and its country <HI>Spain;</HI> the latter of which might prevail with him, who was a Spaniard by birth, to dignify it with one of his own names; and when he tran&s;ported the <HI>Legio VI Victrix</HI> into <HI>Britain,</HI> he might bring this <HI>Cohort</HI> among the <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> that were joined to it: this al&s;o inclines me to think it was part of one of the <HI>Alae</HI> belonging to that Legion, which &s;eems always to have been employed in the North, and to have had its head quarters at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The legionary <HI>Alae</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Cohorts of foreign Auxiliaries, though of how many is uncertain: &s;ometimes we are told they were equal in numbers of men to the <HI>Legion,</HI> and &s;ometimes that they exceeded it: it is therefore probable, that both the <HI>Alae</HI> of a Legion might contain <HI>ten Cohorts,</HI> the number of tho&s;e that con&s;tituted a <HI>Legion,</HI> when compleat.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore agree, that the <HI>Cohors Prima Hi&s;panorum</HI> was compo&s;ed of two <HI>Alae,</HI> the 1^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Herculea</HI> and the <HI>Ala Vettonum;</HI> &s;ince <HI>Alae</HI> were formed of <HI>Cohorts,</HI> and not <HI>Cohorts of Alae.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ala</HI> al&s;o imported a large independent body of hor&s;e, and of this &s;ort &s;eems to have been the <HI>Ala Vettonum,</HI> and the <HI>Ala Prima A&s;turum,</HI> the <HI>Ala Sarmatarum,</HI> &amp;c. all which carry the the names of the countries they originally came from.</P>
<P>The <HI>Legio VI Victrix</HI> was in <HI>Britain</HI> when the <HI>Notitia Imperii</HI> was compiled, as were all tho&s;e <HI>Ala;</HI> it is not therefore unlikely, that the <HI>Ala I Herculea,</HI> and the <HI>Ala Sabiniana</HI> were the wings properly appertaining to it, one &s;o called from the Emperor <HI>Maximianus Herculeus,</HI> the other retaining the name of the Empre&s;s <HI>Sabina</HI> or <HI>Sabinia,</HI> either the wife of the Emperor <HI>Hadrian</HI> that brought this Legion into <HI>Britain,</HI> or of the Emperor <HI>Gordian the Third,</HI> who ho|noured the other wing of it with his own name, which is mo&s;t probable, becau&s;e from the name <HI>Sabina</HI> the appellative adjective <HI>Sabinia</HI> would be properly formed; and from the name <HI>Sabinia,</HI>

<P>I know very well that the fir&s;t Cohort of a Legion u&s;ed &s;ome times to be called Milliaria, for &s;o Ro&s;inus and Vegetius, and before them Mode&s;tus had taught me. I know it con&s;i&s;ted both of hor&s;e and foot, but I thought it a tautology to add after prima Cohors the&s;e letters. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> EQ wherefore I imagined that there was more intended (viz.) directly to &s;ignify that the whole Cohors con&s;i&s;ted of hor&s;e, in number 1000, or that there was belonging to the Cohors 1000 hor&s;e, who were quartered at Netherby; but what was of greater weight with me was, that I believed, that in the latter times of the Roman Empire there were Cohorts entirely of hor&s;e Pliny, in the tenth book of his Epi&s;tles, and I think the 107th Epi&s;tle, furni&s;hed me with a direct proof of this, for he expre&s;ly mentions the Sexta Cohors Eque&s;tris. There was another proof occurred to me, from the 25th chapter of Suetonius in Vita Claudii, where Co|ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s is mentioned inter Eque&s;tres Milites. In the main, I thought it would do as well to read the letters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> EQ. Mille Equitum, as to call the Cohort Prima Milliaria. I plea&s;ed my|&s;elf al&s;o with the fancy, that if the old Lip&s;ius had &s;een this altar, he had acquie&s;ced in the above cited words of Suetonius, and not have read them Seme&s;tres Militias. Some of your editions of that author will direct you to a &s;quabble among&s;t the Critics upon the reading of tho&s;e words, which in my apprehen&s;ion this very altar at Netherby may decide: but be the reading what it will, it plea&s;es me to think that there were Spani&s;h hor&s;e among&s;t us in former times, which perhaps contributed not a little to that breed of hor&s;es which is in tho&s;e parts to this day. I believe the Jock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es will not approve of this conjecture: we generally attribute our breed of galloways to Spani&s;h hor&s;es, though we carry their origin no farther back than the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion in 1588, and the &s;hips which were ca&s;t away on our coa&s;ts; but this is an epi|&s;ode I can ea&s;ily pa&s;s by.</P>
<P>I have only now to add a conjecture of mine, as to the apparent &s;treets in the town of Ne|therby, (viz.) that they were &s;tables for hor&s;es, and of this very kind there are &s;everal in the &s;tation at Middleby: nothing was fitter than hor&s;e to defend them again&s;t my old countrymen the Fugaces Caledonii.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>21&s;t December, 1730.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A letter from you is always extremely acceptable, &s;ince it never fails of bringing its enter|tainment along with it. I never pretended <HI>Ex Tripode loqui,</HI> and if I &s;hould, my re&s;pon&s;es would have no more weight than tho&s;e of the oracles, always dubious, oftener fal&s;e than true. I am much afraid, what you charge me with in your la&s;t, will come out wrong, though your conjectures are very ingenious. As you have communicated them to me, I doubt not but you will give me leave freely to &s;end you my thoughts upon them.</P>
<P>As for the O. M, they can have been nothing but the remains of <HI>Jovi Optimo Maximo,</HI> and perhaps what follows is the remains of <HI>Vexillatio,</HI> though I am not without my &s;cruples as to that. In the fir&s;t place, I do not remember I ever met with &s;uch an in&s;cription as <HI>Vexillatio Cohortis</HI> or <HI>Cohortium,</HI> though frequently with <HI>Vexillatio Legionis,</HI> which I take to imply a de|tachment &s;ent off from the Legion under a <HI>Vexillum,</HI> where we meet with tho&s;e <HI>Vexillationes Leg.</HI> II. VI. XX. upon the wall in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Vexillatio Equitum</HI> is generally taken for <HI>Cohors Equitum,</HI> but as there might be a detachment from a <HI>Cohors</HI> upon occa&s;ion, as well as from a <HI>Legion,</HI> I will not in&s;i&s;t upon that. <HI>Vardulorum</HI> is very plain upon this altar, though a name hitherto unknown in <HI>Britain</HI> I wi&s;h the <HI>Cran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orum</HI> was as much out of di&s;pute for though the <HI>Or</HI> that follow <HI>Vardul</HI> are the initials of that word, yet I cannot think they belong to <HI>Vardulorum,</HI> as you read them, becau&s;e we find but one nation of the <HI>Varduli</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and con&s;equently no occa&s;ion of the additional <HI>Cranei</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from any of their neighbours that might have the &s;ame appellation. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> expre&s;ly &s;ays, the <HI>Varduli Gens Una,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> were two nations of the <HI>Bituriges,</HI> the one therefore was called the <HI>Bituriges Cubi,</HI> the other the <HI>Bituriges Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ci.</HI> As for the <HI>Cranei</HI> upon

<P>My ab&s;ence from home was longer than I de&s;igned, and &s;ince my return have been pre|vented examining originals till this morning: this has occa&s;ioned a delay of the fuller an&s;wer I intended and promi&s;ed. I received the <HI>Rieche&s;ter</HI> in&s;cription ju&s;t before the pre&s;s came to the other in&s;criptions belonging to the &s;ame place, and having no great fondne&s;s for an appendix, I immediately di&s;patched to London &s;ome &s;hort ob&s;ervations on it, in order to their being printed, and in&s;erted in their proper place; &s;o that before I received your fir&s;t letter, it was too late to make any alteration there: however I mu&s;t beg leave to take notice of your conjecture, either in the preface or &s;ome other proper place. <HI>Mr Ward</HI> intends a letter to me, by way of review of all the ob&s;ervations, and there is a proper &s;pace left for that letter, in order to its being in|&s;erted at the end of the ob&s;ervations on the &s;econd Book of the <HI>Bri|tannia Romana.</HI> This letter will be in&s;tead of an appendix,<NOTE N="*"><P>There is no notice taken of this in Mr Ward's letter, but Mr Hor&s;ley in all proba|bility reprinted his ob&s;erva|tions on this in&s;cription.

<P>I have carefully and impartially examined all the letters on the &s;tone, and am convinced that the la&s;t vi&s;ible, though imperfect letter in the 6th line, has been an N, which favours your opinion. I have with my compa&s;&s;es compared the breadth of this letter, with that of all the M's and N's on the &s;tone, and find that it agrees pretty well with the &s;tated or u&s;ual breadth of the N, but always falls &s;en&s;ibly &s;hort of the breadth of the M. This ought to have been re|garded in the copy, though whether it be or not, with &s;ufficient accuracy, is more than I am &s;ure of. The addition of SE at the end of the line, would bring it to an equal length with mo&s;t of the re&s;t; nor have I in this review ob&s;erved any thing on the &s;tone, which is in the lea&s;t unfavourable to your opinion. On the whole, I &s;trongly incline to think you mu&s;t be in the right, and that my own conjecture mu&s;t have the honour to be overthrown by &s;o good a hand as your own, and the <HI>Lanche&s;ter</HI> in&s;cription reduced to its primitive &s;tate of confu&s;ion and darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The remains of the letter at the end of the la&s;t line but one, may be tho&s;e of a C, but are like&s;t tho&s;e of an O, the &s;hape and po&s;ition will by no means allow it to be the top of an S; it is thus DEC, but more perfectly round than I have here drawn it I have compared it care|fully with the S. the C and the O in the in&s;cription, and find that it &s;uits the la&s;t be&s;t, may do for the &s;econd, but not at all for the fir&s;t.</P>

The in&s;cription was erected by <HI>Luctus Caecilius Optatus,</HI> Tribune of the fir&s;t Cohort of the <HI>Varduli.</HI> The great di&s;tance be|tween the G and the L in the fifth line, that is, between the la&s;t letter of the Emperor's name, and the fir&s;t of the Tribune's, is very remarkable. The <HI>Varduli</HI> were a people of <HI>Hi&s;pania Citerior,</HI> &s;ituated not far from the we&s;t end of the <HI>Pyrenaean Mountains.</HI> There are another people in <HI>Hi&s;panta Citertor</HI> u&s;ually named <HI>Grovi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or &s;ometimes <HI>Gronii.</HI> At the fir&s;t &s;ight of this in&s;crip|tion, I concluded that <HI>Graneis</HI> mu&s;t be the name of the &s;ame people, for C and G are often in|terchanged; and <HI>Granei</HI> or <HI>Granii</HI> looked like the name <HI>Grovis</HI> or <HI>Gronii,</HI> and as I apprehended bid fair to be truer than either.

<P>Mr Hor&s;ley's remarks on this altar are as follow. <Q>The original was removed to Connington. The plain and di&s;tinct mention of Bremenium upon this large altar does &s;trongly argue Rieche&s;ter to be the place. The implication and proper cut of the letters, which is neglected in Camden, I have endeavoured to &s;upply from the original. No body that I know of, has given a &s;atisfactory explication of the D. R. S. at the top: I think it plain that they are to be read <HI>Deae Romae &s;acrum.</HI> That they made a Godde&s;s of Rome, and erected altars and temples to her, needs no proof to tho&s;e who have any acquaintance with medals and other Roman Antiquities. There is a curious altar at Elenborough, erected <HI>Genio Loci Fortunae Reduci Romae Aeterne,</HI> &amp;c. I once thought of <HI>Diis Romanis &s;acrum:</HI> but this &s;uits not with <HI>Numini ejus</HI> in the body of the in&s;cription; for which rea&s;on the learned Dr Gales reading <HI>Deabus Rumabus Sacrum</HI> cannot be admitted. The altar then is &s;acred to the Godde&s;s <HI>Rome,</HI> erected by a <HI>Duplares</HI> of a detachment of <HI>Exploratores</HI> or &s;couts at <HI>Bremenium,</HI> under the command of <HI>Caius Caepio Charitinus</HI> the Tribune. Caepio is a con&s;ular name, and we read in the Notitiae, of a <HI>Prae|fectus Numeri exploratorum Lavatris.</HI> Whether they were the &s;ame with the&s;e, I will not undertake to determine. The <HI>Duplares</HI> were &s;oldiers, who had a double allowance of corn, of which a part of the Roman &s;oldiers pay con&s;i&s;ted. The <HI>Exploratores</HI> were, like our &s;couts, &s;ent out to di&s;cover the enemy or their country. When they were in garri&s;on, it is probable they were generally placed, in the more advanced &s;tations, or &s;uch as were mo&s;t con|veniently &s;ituated for pro&s;pect and di&s;covering the fir&s;t approach of the enemy; as al&s;o for guarding the pa&s;&s;es again&s;t their inroads.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="245">Camden adds, <Q>that Ptolomy &s;peaking of Bremenium, places it in this very &s;cite, and part of the country; and from thence Antonine begins his fir&s;t journey in Britain, as from the utmo&s;t limit of the Roman province at that time. When the barbarous nations had broken through the wall of Antoninus Pius, and would in con&s;e|quence hurry over and lay wa&s;te all the country before them, the wall of Hadrian laying neglected to the time of Severus, we may ne|ce&s;&s;arily admit that this &s;tation was regarded as the limit of the Em|pire, from whence the old <HI>Itinerary,</HI> which bears the title of Anto|nine's, began, viz. <HI>a Limitis.</HI> The con&s;truction given it, to imply <HI>a Vallo,</HI> is only a glo&s;s put on it by the tran&s;criber.</Q></P>

<P>Near Nunwick, &s;ome years ago, were the remains of a monument, by mo&s;t writers termed Briti&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting of five natural &s;tone pillars, placed in circular order, near eight feet in height, and twenty feet in girt; the area which they formed, was ninety feet in circumference. Whether the inter&s;tices were heretofore filled up with &s;tones of a &s;maller &s;ize, to compo&s;e a circle, which on the advance of cultivation were re|moved, we have no evidence: Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on only &s;peaks of them as in the &s;tate de&s;cribed.

<P><PB N="214" REF="249">In the Mona&s;ticon we are told, King Edward taking di&s;plea&s;ure at Anthony Beck, then Bi&s;hop of Durham, di&s;membered this church from that See. It was afterwards in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the D'Arcys in the reign of King Edward III. John D'Arcy, at his death, left it to Queen Phi|lippa, who gave it to Wind&s;or College.</P>
<P>Mr Wallis &s;peaks of a remarkable Scull dug up within the walls of the church: <Q>On the back part of it was the figure of a large &s;cal|lop &s;hell: at one of the auditories, the figure of a torcular &s;hell, like a &s;crew.</Q> It is &s;urprizing no Naturali&s;t has attended to this wonder|ful phaenomenon. Mr Wallis him&s;elf, I &s;hould have apprehended, would not have left this great curio&s;ity &s;o &s;lightly treated of. He doth not even &s;ay, whether the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions were &s;culptured, or adhe&s;ions of petrified matter. In either ca&s;e, it would have gratified the virtuo&s;o to have had a perfect de&s;cription. We read of that degree of wanton|ne&s;s and inhumanity, that the &s;culls of enemies, at public fe&s;tivals, were u&s;ed for drinking Cups. Was this ornamented with &s;culpture, it would lead to an apprehen&s;ion it was once employed in &s;uch unhallowed rites. If the&s;e were petrifactions, it would &s;till be more wonderful.</P>
<P>This introduces to my mind a ha&s;ty idea, of petrifactions being e&s;|teemed a te&s;timony of an univer&s;al deluge. It has been in&s;i&s;ted upon by many learned men, but the di&s;coveries hitherto made in that branch are in no wi&s;e convincing. Mo&s;es had his learning from the Egyptians; Mr Bryant has amply di&s;played their knowledge of that great event: I dare not make &s;trictures on that learned work; but opinion is fond of liberty. All the petrifactions I have &s;een in the various collections, do not prevail to fix my judgment in favour of &s;uch te&s;timony. In the fir&s;t chapter of Gene&s;is, we &s;ee the grand work of creation cla&s;&s;ed in &s;ix progre&s;&s;ive orders. In the figures of Ea&s;tern language, it is given under a diurnal arrangement. By &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion, I pre&s;ume, we are not to be confined in our idea of the work, to tho&s;e &s;hort periods: the works of Providence are wonderful to the highe&s;t degree, in a cour&s;e of na|ture;
<PB N="215" REF="250">
why &s;hould we render them &s;till more miraculous, and le&s;s cre|dible, by holding to the very letter of the book of Gene&s;is, without giving a latitude to the expre&s;&s;ion. So much of miracle, and &s;o little of rea&s;on, in modern di&s;&s;ertations, occa&s;ions much infidelity. We &s;ee plainly the work of the divine Architect was progre&s;&s;ive: let us pre&s;ume each day means an age, in which, by a natural and progre&s;&s;ive cour&s;e, "the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, who&s;e &s;eed is in it&s;elf," might arrive to its maturity, from the original &s;tamina the great Creator ordained in the beginning. It was not till the third aera, that the dry land appeared; all before was deluged. Here is a period then, in which all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which we find have left their te&s;timony in petrifac|tion, might re&s;t upon the highe&s;t hills, when at the command of their God, the mountains heaved them&s;elves up from the bo&s;om of the deep. The &s;hifting of va&s;t &s;ands, the falling of mighty precipices rent by earthquakes, mining in various countries, and eruptions of volcanoes, have brought to light tho&s;e materials which are lodged very deep in the earth, and yet none of them have produced any evidence of the de&s;truc|tion of the human race, by petrifactions of parts peculiar to mankind, their implements or uten&s;ils, of which gold would not decay, erections, or other memorials of their antediluvian exi&s;tence. To enter at large into this di&s;qui&s;ition, would lead to a &s;eparate work; it &s;hall &s;uffice at this time to &s;ay, that, if there were no other te&s;timonies exi&s;ting than petri|factions, to prove this great event, we &s;hould &s;till depend upon implicit faith concerning it. To return:</P>
<P>The church of Symondburn has two dependant chapels, Bellingham and Fal&s;ton: the pari&s;h is between thirty and forty miles in length, ex|tending to Lidde&s;dale, in Scotland.

<P>Wallington Hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome &s;tone &s;tructure, but from the mode of architecture, doth not &s;eem to take its date in this century. Before the &s;outh front is a pretty pa&s;ture ground, inclining to the brook of Wan&s;beck: at the ea&s;t front is the grand approach, having a circular coach road, with a beautiful green plot, parterres, and flowering &s;hrubs: plantations and covered walks clo&s;e it to the north, and conceal the offices: the gardens &s;eem well di&s;po&s;ed, on a warm inclination, and the whole makes a plea&s;ing rural appearance, without any intru&s;ion of co&s;tly ornaments and laboured works. In the whole compo&s;ition, there is a degree of ta&s;te mixed with a countenance of ru&s;ticity, which characte|rizes an agreeable retirement. Nothing is &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the eye, as temples, pagodas, columns, pyramids, Gothic banquetting-hou&s;es, and modern ruins, jumbled into a few acres, with that confu&s;ion and want of ta&s;te, which over-loaded opulence often di&s;gorges round a modern villa. True ta&s;te is attached to nature &s;o intimately, that each di&s;po&s;i|tion by art mu&s;t be made to heighten her beauties, not to di&s;tort her, and over-burthen the &s;cene with a progeny adopted from all the quar|ters of the earth. A bad &s;ituation cannot be changed; nay it is not even improved by gorgeous works: a load of edifices is only like finery on a deformed object&mdash;but di&s;po&s;e the works of art in a ju&s;t adaption to the &s;ituation, and in the mode pointed out by nature, and they grow into elegance.</P>
<P>The nearer pro&s;pect from Wallington over the vale is rich; to the &s;outh-ea&s;t the view is exten&s;ive, though not much variegated: in a clear atmo&s;phere the &s;ea is vi&s;ible from thence, at the extream of a level not le&s;s than twenty miles in length.</P>

The a&s;cent for more than a mile is gradual, and the road in a direct line from Wallington, &s;o that the hedge rows form a vi&s;ta, terminated by the dome of the offices, which has an agreeable effect. The pro&s;pect here is exten&s;ive and noble; &s;ome coalworks to the right deform the nearer ground, but all beyond is of that happy compo&s;ition, which cultivation, mixing with natural woods and fanciful plantations, give the land&s;kip; object decrea&s;ing after object, and &s;tretching from the eye till mingled in the azure of the atmo&s;phere, in which all the horizon lay &s;oftened and blended.</P>

<P>The way from thence to Rothbury is very crooked, and by cro&s;s roads rendered perplexed. About Wallington we &s;aw &s;ome guide-po&s;ts, but in few other places in the country, and &s;everal of tho&s;e having been painted, were obliterated, and only mocked our anxiety. Many bridges give ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age over the brooks, but their flanks are &s;uffered to be walled up or clo&s;ed, &s;o that the traveller is deprived of the nece&s;&s;ary

refre&s;hment for his cattle. The carts were pa&s;&s;ing unmarked, and their drivers in&s;olent to a high degree.</P>
<P>We had a view of <HI>Rothbury Ca&s;tle</HI> at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles; the &s;ituation appeared rugged and uncommon. On the &s;ide which then pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, we could di&s;cern di&s;tinctly no more than the &s;quare tower and part of its flankings, placed on a con&s;iderable eminence, of a rocky and barren a&s;pect. By not taking the proper road, we were led almo&s;t round this edifice, which we viewed with no &s;mall degree of impatiency. When we came to look upon the northern front, our curio&s;ity was &s;ome|what &s;lackened, but neverthele&s;s we pa&s;&s;ed down the road about half a mile, and having climbed the fence, a&s;cended the &s;teep to the building. The fatigue was but ill recompen&s;ed, for we found this object of our anxious curio&s;ity, no other than an ornamental &s;tructure, compo&s;ed of a &s;quare tower, flanked with a curvated wall, embattled, and pierced with loop-holes, and each wing terminated with a ba&s;tion: the &s;ituation romantick, on the brink of a broken precipice. The &s;ides of this hill, to the we&s;t and &s;outh, pre&s;ent a &s;haken and tremendous rocky &s;teep, rent into va&s;t impending columns and ma&s;&s;ive tables; the &s;tones of enormous bulk, in many places hang on each other in &s;uch loo&s;e po&s;i|tions, as if ready to fall into the vale; forming caverns and rece&s;&s;es, and rude heaps of rocks of a mo&s;t wild and grote&s;que appearance. To decorate (I pre&s;ume) this noble &s;cene, the awkward images of a goat and a &s;taring &s;tag, delight the pa&s;&s;ing children.&mdash;On re&s;orting to my book of notes, I find they carry the countenance of peevi&s;hne&s;s, but as they are ju&s;t, I will tran&s;cribe them. The &s;outhern front opens on a &s;mall plain, naturally of a circular form, &s;cattered over with huge heads of griffins, broken cornices, and en&s;igns of Calverly (the lamb and flag of Grace) &s;culptured on white free-&s;tone; in the mid&s;t of which &s;tand two prepo&s;terous effigies, repre&s;entative of no known dre&s;s, per&s;onage, or people. And to give the coup de grace to this compo&s;ition, enormous ribs, jaw-bones, and members of a whale, are fa&s;tened to the walls for decorations. We entered the tower, in which, by way of tables, are three large rude unhewed &s;tones, one in the center, and one in each re|ce&s;s at the &s;ides, benched with &s;imilar &s;tones: pretty enough for the reception of Thomas of Hick-a-thrift or Jack the Giant-killer.</P>
<P>We had from this plot one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive views in Northum|berland. Ea&s;tward we overlooked the vale which opened upon us at Wal|lington, on which many gentlemen's &s;eats were &s;cattered, mingled with
<PB N="224" REF="259">
woody plots&mdash;very remote objects give little plea&s;ure to the eye, except what it derives from the diver&s;ity of colouring&mdash;the &s;ea formed the di&s;|tant horizon. To the &s;outhward we had a view of Cambo and the hills beyond Wallington, with Mr Delaval's tower, the deformity of which might now be forgot, for the agreeable obeli&s;k it gave to the pro&s;pect from hence. The we&s;tern view was more confined, but wholly culti|vated, and the north frowned in rocks, mountains, and barren heath. In de&s;cending the hill, a curvated canal pre&s;ented it&s;elf, margined with young plantations, on who&s;e border a tent was pitched. This was one of Sir Walter's retreats. The family being there, we did not vi&s;it <HI>Rothly Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Codgey Crag,</HI> a &s;tupendous cliff, crowned with another un|couth ornament, in the &s;tile of the former.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in this pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Rothbury,</HI> in many parts where we could view a tract country for the di&s;tance of three or four miles, all con&s;i&s;ting of cultivated land, the farm-hou&s;es were &s;o very di&s;tant, and the inhabitants few, that for miles we did not perceive a human being in the whole circle. The fields did not engage people in tillage, and the roads were almo&s;t without pa&s;&s;engers, &s;o that a &s;tranger at mid|day, might wander far from the way leading to the place of his de&s;tination, before he could correct his mi&s;take. Where tillage is ne|glected, and large farms are thrown into gra&s;s, it mu&s;t be the ca&s;e; the country is depopulated, the indu&s;trious labourer cannot procure bread, and an engro&s;&s;ing farmer, in a &s;tate of indolence, grows opulent by his herds, &amp;c. at the lo&s;s to community, of tho&s;e members of the common|wealth in whom the &s;trength of the nation con&s;i&s;ts, who are, by a de|plorable nece&s;&s;ity, driven to emigrate; an event which will at once &s;ap the &s;tate, and impoveri&s;h the &s;ubject. Boys who would otherwi&s;e have been employed in hu&s;bandry, are bound out to manufactories; our ma|nufacturers are grown more numerous than trade can maintain; the hu&s;bandman's labour is not wanted, his hands are &s;hifted to a different employ; and the hardy race of Britons are &s;unk into a &s;tate of imbecil|lity, and reduced to the languid and meagre &s;hadows of men, who hang upon the loom. The difficulty of recruiting the army and manning the navy will every day increa&s;e&mdash;the re&s;ources are taken away. Not one-fourth part of the number of families are employed in hu&s;bandry in the north, there was forty years ago. This was a nur&s;ery for the army and the fleet. The enlarging farms, and
<PB N="225" REF="260">
reducing the tillage, is a capital error, which though &s;low in its con|&s;equences, yet is as &s;ure as fate. Sub&s;tituting the hor&s;e for the ox in hu&s;bandry, is a mi&s;taken maxim, which for a temporary profit has crept in upon us: the ox was advancing in value, and increa&s;ing the &s;upply of the market as he laboured: the hor&s;e takes twice the maintenance, con&s;uming a va&s;t portion of grain, and his price is &s;ink|ing yearly into nothing. Not expo&s;ing the nece&s;&s;aries of life in open market, is another matter that prejudices the poor, by increa&s;ing prices; an artificial &s;carcity is thereby much ea&s;ier to be effected. I am bold to &s;ay, that if a law was made to oblige plowing by oxen, and to enforce every article of the farmer to be brought to open market to be &s;old within a limitted time, we &s;hould experience much greater plenty. Of my own knowledge, wheat, (when 6s. 6d. the Winche&s;ter bu&s;hel) in immen&s;e quantities, has been kept up till &s;poiled, and made fit for no|thing but hogs. I cannot avoid adopting Mr Pennant's &s;entiments on a view of the like kind. Speaking of his entry into Northumberland at Cornhill, he &s;ays, <Q>All this country is open, de&s;titute of trees, and al|mo&s;t even of hedges; for hedges are in their infancy in the&s;e parts, as it is not above &s;even or eight years &s;ince they have been introduced &mdash;the land is fertile, &s;wells into gentle ri&s;ings, and is rich in corn. It is mi&s;erably depopulated; a few great farm-hou&s;es and hamlets ap|pear rarely &s;cattered over the va&s;t tracts. There are few farms of le&s;s value than 150l. a year. They are generally three, four, or five hun|dred; and I heard of one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle family, that even reached twenty-five hundred: in this was a &s;ingle field of 3000 acres, and which took 600 bolls of &s;eed wheat, of &s;ix Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels each. A humour fatal to the commonwealth prevails over many parts of the north, of flinging numbers of &s;mall tenements into a large one, in order to &s;ave the expence of building; or perhaps to avoid the multiplicity of receipts, lay a whole country into a &s;heep walk. The&s;e devour poor men's hou&s;es, and expel the ancient inha|bitants from their fire-&s;ides, to &s;eek their bread in a &s;trange land. I have heard of a character (I forgot the &s;pot it cur&s;es) that is too bar|barous and infamous to be overlooked; which has &s;o little feeling, as to depopulate a village of 200 &s;ouls, and to level their hou&s;es to the ground; to de&s;troy eight or ten farm-hou&s;es on an e&s;tate of 1000l. a year, for the &s;ake of turning almo&s;t the whole into a &s;heep walk.&mdash; There he lives, and there he may long live his own tormentor! dete&s;t|ing, dete&s;ted by all mankind. Wark and Learmouth, once con&s;i|derable
<PB N="226" REF="261">
places, are now &s;carcely inhabited. The la&s;t formerly a great market town, is now reduced to a &s;ingle farm-hou&s;e. The inhabitants have long &s;ince been di&s;per&s;ed, forced to exchange the whol&s;ome, the vigorous, the innocent lives of the rural oeconomi&s;ts, for the &s;ickly &s;hort-lived employs of manufacturers in Birmingham and other great towns, where di&s;ea&s;e, and often corrupted morals, cau&s;e double the con&s;umption of people as would happen were they permitted to enjoy their ancient &s;eats. The want of labourers begins to be &s;en&s;ibly felt. As a proof, they are retained by the year; and policy dictates to their employers the affording them good wages: each has his cottage, a a piece of land gratis, and a &s;hilling a day in &s;ummer and ten-pence in winter. I call this good pay, in a country which ought to be very cheap; if not, what are the fine effects of the great improve|ments? The Spectator &s;peaks much of the de&s;erts of the man that rai&s;es two ears of corn where one grew before. But who will point out the man who has the &s;oul to make his poor brethren feel the happy effects of his art? I believe, that at pre&s;ent there are numbers who have rai&s;ed ten for one that were known a few years ago. It would be natural to &s;uppo&s;e that plenty would introduce cheapne&s;s; but till the providential plenty of the pre&s;ent year, corn was exactly double the value of what it was 14 years pa&s;t. Yet the plenty of money has not been found doubled by the poor manufacturer or la|bourer. The land owner in the north hath taken full care of him&s;elf. A farm of 75l. per annum 20 years ago, has been lately &s;et for 365l. Another of 230l. will be &s;oon &s;et for 1000l. per annum. An e&s;tate was bought in 1759 for 6800l. it con&s;i&s;ted of 1560 acres, of which 750 have been &s;old for 8400l. and all the&s;e improvements re&s;ult from the unprincipled and iniquitous notion, of making the buyer of the produce pay not only to &s;atisfy the demand of the landlord, but to enable the farmer to make a princely fortune, and to live with a luxury the &s;hame of the times. They have lo&s;t the re&s;pectable cha|racter of the Old Engli&s;h Yeomanry, by too clo&s;e an imitation of the extravagant follies of their betters.</Q></P>

<P>This is a deplorable part of the country for a &s;tranger to be benighted in; the heavy vapours which frequently envelope the hills the whole day, as frequently attend the advance of night into the vale, as it happened to us, and brings on a darkne&s;s truly to be felt; whil&s;t there there is no hou&s;e, inhabitant, or pa&s;&s;enger, for miles, to direct your way.</P>
<P>We were thankful when we gained &s;ight of the Inn at Wooler Haugh; the court-yard, which we de&s;cended into from the road, was crowded indeed with waggons and carriages, and the lights in the &s;tables &s;hewed there were &s;everal gue&s;ts in the hou&s;e, but of what quality and denomina|tion, we could not divine. When we alighted, the ho&s;tler looked to be in &s;ome confu&s;ion; but we did not devi&s;e the rea&s;on, being willing not to premi&s;e any thing to our di&s;advantage at that time of night, in the rain, and in a country not known to any of us. We were met by a jolly ho&s;te&s;s at the door, who de&s;ired us, with all the courte&s;y of a civil publican, to walk in. We were introduced to the kitchen, and required to air our cloaths, till the people got lights and prepared a room. It was now time to con&s;ider the &s;cene; the kitchen &s;melled rank of cooking, for there was as much bu&s;tle, as if they were preparing a hecatomb: the room was populous to a degree, for the mi&s;tre&s;s and two jolly nymphs her daughters &s;tickled in the cookery, whil&s;t there went backward and forward, in and out, ho&s;tlers, livery &s;ervants, car|riers, and &s;avages of various denominations, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; carrying, &s;eeking, fetching, or calling for innumerable matters, like the confu&s;ion of Babel, in the greate&s;t agitation and emergency. When

The table was covered with mangled joints of victuals; above us, before us, on this hand and on that, was the noi&s;e of tumultuous companies, creating that di&s;cordance of &s;ounds; which di&s;tracts an Inn at a fair;&mdash;hallowing, laughing, ringing of bells, beating on tables, menaces, oaths, female titterations, and mu&s;ic were in the compo&s;ition.

I would have told him, if it had been in my power: I found my&s;elf to|tally embarra&s;&s;ed, till at length this horrid di&s;cordance rouzed me, and on expre&s;&s;ing unea&s;ine&s;s at not being &s;hewn to our apartment, we were told the room was clearing of its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who were going to bed.

By the e&s;cheats of the reign of King Richard II. it appears there was an Ho&s;pital here dedicated to Mary Magdalen. In the neighbourhood of Wooler are &s;everal intrenchments and kairns; one at a place called Cattle Well, which has the name of Maiden Ca&s;tle, and another, a very con&s;iderable one, at Trodden Gares.</P>
<P>Wooler is &s;ituate to the ea&s;t of Cheviots, in an ill cultivated country, under the influence of va&s;t mountains, from whence it is &s;ubject to im|petuous rains. It is a place of great re&s;ort in the &s;ummer months, for invalids to drink goats milk or whey. The church is placed on a fine eminence, and having been lately rebuilt, is commodious. It is &s;aid the mother church was at Fenton, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river Till, now totally in ruins.</P>
<P>Our amu&s;ement in the &s;ucceeding morning was among &s;uch hills, as have &s;eldom been thought acce&s;&s;able by parties of plea&s;ure. By Humbledon Burn, on an ea&s;y inclination, is an intrenchment called Green Ca&s;tle; and on Humbledon Hugh, about a mile to the north|we&s;t of Wooler, is a circular intrenchment, with a large kairn. The &s;ide of the hill is cut in various terraces, ri&s;ing above each other. This &s;eems to have been calculated for a temporary fort, and the mode gene|rally practi&s;ed in ancient times in this part of the country. Many of tho&s;e terraces are formed with great exactne&s;s, about 20 feet in breadth. In &s;ome places there are three of tho&s;e flights or terraces; in others I ob&s;erved five, placed in regular gradations, one above the other. The&s;e were outworks of an important nature, to defend a body of Chiefs, or a valuable booty, which occupied the crown of a hill. The original mode I pre&s;ume was Dani&s;h, though tho&s;e works are properly attri|buted to the Scotch and Engli&s;h before the battle in 1402. The &s;ummit of a hill being levelled, I conceive received the officers of highe&s;t rank and the mo&s;t valuable effects of the camp; to which the platforms ri&s;ing above each other, and encircling the hill, when filled with troops would make a powerful defence.</P>
<P>In the plain beneath is a &s;tone pillar, denoting the ground where 10,000 of the Scots, under Earl Douglas, in the reign of King Henry IV. on Holy-rood-day, 1402, had a great overthrow, by Henry Lord Percy and George Earl of March. Douglas's forces had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the emi|nence, but his pa&s;&s;age into Scotland being intercepted by Earl Percy,
<PB N="243" REF="278">
he was obliged to engage on this plain: the battle was &s;o bloody, that the lands gained the name of Redriggs, from the &s;laughter with which they were &s;tained. According to Holling&s;head, among the pri&s;oners were the Earls of Fife, Murray, Angus, Athol, Orkney, and Monteath, the Lords Montgomery and Er&s;kine, and about 80 Knights. Douglas received five wounds and lo&s;t an eye. Being hotly pur&s;ued, in the flight 500 Scots were drowned in Tweed, the mo&s;t of their army on this fatal day dying or being pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, was chiefly on an oppo&s;ite mount to that occupied by the Scotch, except their archers, who were arranged on the plain. The Scots were &s;o galled by the flights of arrows, to which we may pre&s;ume they were extremely expo&s;ed, if mar&s;halled on tho&s;e terraces before de&s;cribed, that they grew impatient of re&s;traint, and with their whole force de&s;cended into the plain, to come to clo&s;er battle. The Engli&s;h al&s;o advanced, their archers retiring in well compacted bodies, to admit the other troops into the line, at the &s;ame time di&s;charging &s;uch flights of arrows, as no armour could re&s;i&s;t, and thereby the Scots were &s;oon broken and thrown into confu&s;ion. Sir John Swinton and Adam Gordon &s;everal times rallied flying parties, and renewed the battle with the greate&s;t bravery, till they fell among the &s;lain. Hi&s;|torians mention no per&s;on of note on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h who was &s;lain that day, the victory being entirely the work of the archers, the other troops being &s;aid not to have engaged.</P>

They repre&s;ent them as very knowing and enterprizing; and with good rea&s;on. They were the fir&s;t who ventured upon the &s;eas and took long voyages. They &s;hewed their &s;uperiority and addre&s;s in the numberle&s;s expeditions which they made, and the difficulties which they &s;urmounted.

the name of the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> They lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of it, by the conque&s;ts of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> under <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> The lands which fell in divi&s;ion to the tribe of <HI>A&s;her,</HI> extended to <HI>Sidon;</HI> that city notwith|&s;tanding was not &s;ubdued. If the conque&s;ts of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> took from the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> a great part of their dominion, they were well paid by the con&s;equences of that event. In effect the greate&s;t part of the ancient inhabitants of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> &s;eeing them&s;elves threatened with entire de|&s;truction, had recour&s;e to flight to &s;ave them&s;elves. <HI>Sidon</HI> offered them an a&s;ylum. By this eruption of the Hebrew people, the <HI>Sido|nians</HI> were enabled to &s;end colonies where ever they thought proper. <HI>Sidon</HI> lent them &s;hips, and made good u&s;e of the&s;e new inhabitants, to extend their trade and form &s;ettlements. From hence that great number of colonies, which went from <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> to &s;pread them&s;elves in all the countries of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> We may date this event, about the year of the world 2553, and 1451 years before Chri&s;t. <HI>Spain</HI> was not the only country beyond the <HI>pillars of Hercules,</HI> which the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> penetrated. Being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean, they extended them&s;elves to the left of the Straits of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as well as to the right. <HI>Strabo</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that the&s;e people had gone over a part of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> a little time after the war of <HI>Troy.</HI> We might perhaps determine their pa&s;&s;age into <HI>England,</HI> by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furni&s;hes us with: they are per&s;uaded that all the <HI>Tin</HI> that was con&s;umed in the known world came from the I&s;les of <HI>Ca&s;&s;itorides;</HI> and there is no doubt tho&s;e I&s;les were the <HI>Sorlingues</HI> and a part of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> We &s;ee by the books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that in his time <HI>Tin</HI> was known in <HI>Pale&s;tine.

<P>Near <HI>Yevering</HI> is a place known by the name of <HI>Yevering Bell,</HI> a lofty mountain, one of the north-we&s;t Cheviots, of an oblong figure, ari&s;ing to a cone. The name is &s;uppo&s;ed, by the inhabitants of the country, to be derived from the figure of the hill; and con&s;equently as appli|cable to any other of like form as this, of which there are many among the Cheviots. We a&s;cended the mountain from <HI>Yevering,</HI> by winding round its &s;ide to the &s;outh and ea&s;t, the only means of climbing to the top, which was not attained without great labour, from the &s;teepne&s;s of
<PB REF="282">

<PB N="247" REF="283">
the a&s;cent, the height of the <HI>Bell</HI> being upwards 2000 perpendicular feet, taken from the plain at <HI>Yevering.</HI> The &s;ummit of the mountain is almo&s;t level, encinctured with the remains of a wall, placed on the brink of the &s;teep, which when entire was of con&s;iderable &s;trength, as appears from the materials. The wall has been built without mortar, of large flat &s;tones, with which the country abounds. This wall forms and inclo&s;es an area of 1000 paces in circumference; the entrance is on the &s;outh &s;ide. The breadth of the ruins of the wall on a medium is eight yards; and by the &s;tones on the &s;urface, it may be computed that there are about four fothers of &s;tones to the yard. It a&s;toni&s;hes the &s;pectator, on viewing the&s;e remains, when he computes that 4000 fo|thers of &s;tones, at lea&s;t, were employed in this erection, and tho&s;e borne by human hands, to a place totally inacce&s;&s;able by carriages or cattle bearing burthens. It may be alledged indeed, that in a plot of ground 1000 paces in circumference many &s;tones might be won; but the crown of the hill doth in no wi&s;e encourage &s;uch a conjecture; the ground wearing altogether a natural countenance, no rocks or quarries appearing within the area to furni&s;h &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of &s;tone, and where the turf is broken, a &s;mall gravel appears. The ea&s;tern end of the area ri&s;es &s;ome few feet from the level of the plain. Taking our cour&s;e by the wall before de&s;cribed, at a point almo&s;t due ea&s;t, a broad way appeared, three paces wide in a &s;traight direction, as if formed by an even pavement, extending about 30 yards in a&s;cent towards the crown of the hill. We found this eminence &s;urrounded by the remains of another wall, but con&s;i&s;ting of fewer materials, in an exact circle, 180 paces in circumference, with a ditch within. Near the center of this inner area, rather inclining to the ea&s;t, is a kairn of &s;tones, of no very great height, ari&s;ing about 10 paces in an ea&s;y a&s;cent from the level of the inner wall. The center of the kairn is hollow like a ba&s;on, &s;ix paces from brim to brim. After removing the turf and &s;oil for a little depth, we found the &s;tones reduced to a &s;ort of <HI>calx,</HI> and every where retaining a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of fire. The view from this moun|tain is very exten&s;ive, it affords a pro&s;pect of near 20 miles north|ward into Scotland, and over Northumberland many miles to the &s;outh|ea&s;t; an opening of the mountains on that &s;ide, and an exten&s;ive plain to the northward, giving it that great command of pro&s;pect. As a beacon hill it was fortunately placed; as a place of heatheni&s;h wor&s;hip, it was con&s;picuous from many points of view, where the &s;acrificial rites might be di&s;covered, and thereby the people called to wor&s;hip. On the northern &s;ide of the mountain, are the remains of a fore&s;t
<PB N="248" REF="284">
or exten&s;ive grove of oaks; a circum&s;tance, not to be found, or at lea&s;t not di&s;covered by us, on any of the hills within view from the &s;ummit of Yevering Bell. On many parts of the &s;ides of the hill are the remains of circular buildings, but now &s;o totally ruined, and the &s;tones &s;o &s;cattered, that their former con&s;equence or u&s;e are not to be di&s;covered, little more than the form of the foundations remaining. Several of them I took to be no other than folds for enclo&s;ing a number of &s;heep or cattle, the ruins not containing materials &s;ufficient for any large erection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Wallis a account of this remarkable place, is loo&s;e and un&s;atisfactory. <Q>About two hundred yards we&s;t from this Column, is a high hill called Yevering Bell, from its bell-like &s;hape; the top of an oblong figure; a Kairn on the ea&s;t &s;ide, with a circular Trench; many circular foundations of buildings upon the &s;ides or &s;lopes of both; the whole encompa&s;&s;ed with a Wall of Whin&s;tone of a great breadth and length, fallen down by age and tempe&s;ts; the work &s;eemingly of the Pagan Danes, for their Prie&s;toood and Nobles to a&s;&s;emble on, for legi&s;lation, for devotion, and &s;epulture.</Q></NOTE> The works on this mount appear to me of very remote antiquity, and in attempting to explain their nature, I will con&s;ider them &s;ingly, and furni&s;h the reader with all the lights I have collected; as I pre&s;ume they are &s;o &s;ingular as to attract the attention of travellers who may hereafter traver&s;e this country in &s;earch of antiquities. In the fir&s;t place, we will con&s;ider this object in the manner it would naturally call for a &s;tranger's attention. It cannot be conceived, from the loftine&s;s of the mountain, the extreme difficulty of acce&s;s, the coldne&s;s of that high region, and the inclemency of weather it is naturally &s;ubject to, to have been u&s;ed as a place of &s;trength: from the&s;e natural cau&s;es al&s;o, it is not probable it &s;hould be u&s;ed as a place for &s;ecuring cattle and flocks again&s;t the incur&s;ions of an enemy: it may rea&s;onably, from its very nature, be admitted to be u&s;ed for religious offices. If u&s;ed as a beacon only, then whence the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e circumvallations? It has been conceived by &s;ome,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr Wallis in his Antiquities of Northumberland.</NOTE> that it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Danes, and that the&s;e works appertained to that people, who here held their civil and religious conventions. Kairns, placed on &s;uch immen&s;e eminences, if marks of &s;epulture, mu&s;t denote the place of interment of remarkable per&s;onages, and tho&s;e too who did not die by the &s;word; for the uni|ver&s;al cu&s;tom of the ancient inhabitants of this land, who rai&s;ed a tu|mulus over the dead, appears to have been that of interring them where they were &s;lain. The circular buildings, if appropriations to the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice, mu&s;t have been adapted to &s;everal and &s;eparate mini&s;ters; a thing &s;carcely probable. If to the mini&s;tring of religious
<PB N="249" REF="285">
rites, or to &s;epulture, then indeed the incon&s;i&s;tency cea&s;es. The interior circumvallation appears calculated for the exclu&s;ion of the vulgar, from the principal &s;cene of religious rites, where the prie&s;ts and chief per&s;o|nages only mini&s;tred. The wall which forms the grand enclo&s;ure of the whole crown of the mountain, includes 16 acres and a half, or very near it, and would contain a prodigious number of people.</P>
<P>In this wild and mountainous country, the names and marks of an|tiquity have e&s;caped tho&s;e changes which naturally follow cultiva|tion; and it is in &s;uch parts we are to &s;earch for the evidences of the mo&s;t remote antiquity exi&s;ting in this kingdom. It is certain the Druids, though they built temples and paid their adoration towards the Sun, always retained &s;uch di&s;tinction in their wor&s;hip, that they looked up to the great Luminary as the Throne, or as the &s;ymbol and archetype only of the Divinity; which they confe&s;&s;ed, created and go|verned the univer&s;e, and was the &s;ole &s;pirit of exi&s;tence. It will not follow, that this purity was retained by all the inhabitants of the &s;ame land, or the &s;ame mode of wor&s;hip gained an univer&s;al acceptation among them; many appointed for them&s;elves places for private adora|tion, and the&s;e eminences were mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the cho&s;en &s;pots for de|votees, who paying their wor&s;hip to the Sun, might lo&s;s the &s;ymbolical character, and confounded with ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, forget the archetype for the object. The name of <HI>Bel</HI> authorizes me to pre&s;ume this place was &s;acred to the Sun, it being derived from the <HI>Chaldean</HI> language, and &s;ignifying the Sun. Mr Bryant &s;ays, <Q>many wor&s;hipped upon hills, and on the tops of high mountains, imagining that they thereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven. This prac|tice in early times was almo&s;t univer&s;al, and every mountain was e&s;teemed holy. The people who retired to eminences, fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the air, and the Deity who re&s;ided in the higher regions. But the chief excellence for which they were frequented, was the <HI>Omphi,</HI> the <HI>Vox divina,</HI> being e&s;teemed a particular revelation from heaven. In &s;hort, they looked upon them as the peculiar places, where God delivered his oracles. The word <HI>Omphi,</HI> &s;ignifying the <HI>Oracle of Ham,</HI> who, according to the <HI>Egygtian theology,</HI> was the &s;ame as the <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> he was likewi&s;e revered as the chief Deity of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> and by mo&s;t of the nations of the Ea&s;t:</Q>&mdash;Having thus &s;hewn the choice made by the Ancients of high places, for their adoration, I will next con&s;ider the name of this place, according to the <HI>etymologies</HI> laid down by Mr Bryant.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="286"><Q><HI>Bel, Bal,</HI> or <HI>Baal,</HI> is a <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> title, appropriated to the <HI>Sun;</HI> and made u&s;e of by the <HI>Amonians</HI> in other countries: particularly in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Canaan.</HI> It &s;ignified <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Lord,</HI> and is often found compounded with other terms; as <HI>Bel-Hamon,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Bel-Shamaim,</HI> the <HI>great Lord of the heavens.</HI> This was a title given by the <HI>Syrians</HI> to the <HI>Sun.</HI> By <HI>Gib</HI> is meant an hill. <HI>Gibeon</HI> was the hill of the <HI>Sun.

<P>As to the kairn, which I mentioned to be &s;ituate on the ea&s;tern point of the area, on the crown of the mount, which is a conical pile, termi|nating obtu&s;ely, and ba&s;oned as before de&s;cribed, I pre&s;ume its name to be derived from <Q><HI>Keren,</HI> which (according to Mr Bryant) &s;ignifies in its original &s;en&s;e <HI>a Horn;</HI> but it was a title of the <HI>Sun</HI> him&s;elf: for <HI>Apollo</HI> was named <HI>Carneus;</HI> which was no other than <HI>Cereneus,</HI> the <HI>&s;upreme Deity,</HI> the <HI>Lord of Light.</HI> The Prie&s;t of <HI>Cybele,</HI> in <HI>Phrygia,</HI> was &s;tiled <HI>Carnas,</HI> which was a title of the Deity whom he &s;erved.</Q> Whence it is deducible, that our <HI>kairn</HI> on the &s;ummit of this mount, was the place of the altar, where religious rites were performed in the fire wor&s;hip. And the like may be conceived of all tho&s;e conical mounts called <HI>kairns,</HI> they being a corruption of "<HI>Kir-on,</HI> the place of the <HI>Sun.</HI>" In forming the&s;e <HI>kairns,</HI> as well the pre&s;ent one as others we vi&s;ited in this neighbourhood, and one in particular on the crown of one of the highe&s;t mountains above <HI>Newton,</HI> called <HI>Newton We&s;t Tor,</HI> the &s;tones mu&s;t have been carried up by a multitude of hands, with immen&s;e la|bour. Suppo&s;e by the dimen&s;ions of one of the&s;e <HI>kairns,</HI> which mea|&s;ured near 40 paces in circumference, that there was contained therein 300 carriage loads of pebbles; we will find the computation of labour and hands to be immen&s;e, for the con&s;truction thereof, when all the materials mu&s;t be borne two miles of &s;teep a&s;cent to this amazing accu|mulation. I was induced to believe I &s;hould di&s;cover &s;ome hearth &s;tone or altar on the crown of &s;ome of the <HI>kairns,</HI> but was di&s;appointed. Per|haps time and the abhorrence which grew up with Conver&s;ion again&s;t the rites of the heathen, had removed the &s;uper&s;tructure, if any &s;uch there had been. There was not one of the <HI>kairns</HI> I vi&s;ited had the re|gular
<PB N="251" REF="287">
hollow ba&s;on, but that on the <HI>Bell,</HI> which was exactly circular, but compo&s;ed of &s;tones of a &s;mall &s;ize, as far as I &s;earched. On my view, I was immediately per&s;uaded that all the&s;e accumulations called <HI>kairns,</HI> &s;ituated on mountains and high places, had not proceeded from a pa&s;|&s;ion of honouring the dead, but were formed by zealots, who attending their wor&s;hip, carried with them progre&s;&s;ively a burthen, to add to the grandeur, loftine&s;s, and immen&s;ity of the &s;acred place, where they paid their adoration. The <HI>kairn</HI> on <HI>Yevering</HI> is to the <HI>ea&s;t,</HI> an object regarded in the &s;tructures of the ancient Britons, in the remote&s;t antiquity, and by the Ea&s;terns, in erections of the like u&s;e. The&s;e places have re|tained their ancient forms, and their fir&s;t names uncorrupted, by rea&s;on of the mountainous nature of the country. Where cultivation cannot advance, things of this &s;ort mu&s;t re&s;t for ages unchanged: it has been the ca&s;e here. Be&s;ides, the inhabitants are few, and tho&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the extreme verge of poverty, hourly employed in procuring a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Add to this the depopulations which war for many ages occa&s;ioned, would prevent tho&s;e alterations which take place in times of peace. Mr Bryant &s;ays, <Q>The people of <HI>Cappadocia and Pontus</HI> ob|&s;erved the like method of wor&s;hip: and of all &s;acrifices whatever, ex|hibited upon high places, none perhaps ever equalled in magnificence, that which was offered by Mithridates, upon his war with the Ro|mans. He followed the <HI>Per&s;ic</HI> modes of wor&s;hip, as well as the mixed rites of the <HI>Chaldeans and Syrians.</HI> Hence he cho&s;e one of the highe&s;t mountains in his dominions; upon the top of which he reared an immen&s;e pile, equal in &s;ize to the &s;ummit on which it &s;tood; and there he &s;acrificed to the God of <HI>Armies.</HI> The pile was rai&s;ed by his va&s;&s;al Princes: and the offerings, be&s;ides tho&s;e cu&s;tomary, were <HI>wine, honey, oil,</HI> and every &s;pecies of <HI>aromatics.</HI> The fire is &s;aid to have been perceived at the di&s;tance of near a thou&s;and &s;tadia.</Q> So much mu&s;t &s;uffice, on this point, and in this place, from innumerable in|&s;tances produced by this learned author.</P>
<P>My next enquiry will be, touching the circumvallation which appears on <HI>Yevering Bell;</HI> to &s;hew that this was a practice with the Ancients, on their con&s;ecrated hills. Mr Bryant &s;ays, <Q>The <HI>Helladians</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were of the &s;ame family: hence we find many &s;imilar rites &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the two nations. The latter adhered to the purer <HI>Zabai&s;m,</HI> which they maintained a long time. They erected the &s;ame &s;acred <HI>Tupha</HI> (or Tumulus) as the <HI>Grecians:</HI> and we may be a&s;&s;ured of the original purpo&s;e for which the&s;e hills were rai&s;ed, from the u&s;e to
<PB N="252" REF="288">
which they put them. They were dedicated to <HI>the great Fountain of Light,</HI> called by the <HI>Per&s;ians, Anait;</HI> and were &s;et apart as <HI>puratheia,</HI> for the celebration of the rites of <HI>fire.</HI> This people, after they had defeated the <HI>Sacae</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> rai&s;ed an immen&s;e <HI>Comah,</HI> in memo|rial of their victory. <HI>Strabo,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. p. 779.</NOTE> who de&s;cribes it very minutely, tells us, that they cho&s;e a convenient &s;pot, where they reared a <HI>Petra,</HI> or <HI>high place,</HI> by heaping up a va&s;t mound of earth. This they fa&s;hioned to <HI>a conical figure,</HI> and then &s;urrounded it <HI>with a wall of &s;tone.</HI> In this manner they founded a temple, in honour of <HI>Anait.</HI> I have men|tioned that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> had hills of this nature, and from them the cu&s;tom was tran&s;mitted to <HI>Greece.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The circular buildings mentioned to appear on the &s;ides of the mount, will be the la&s;t objects which require my attention, before I draw my general conclu&s;ion. I confe&s;s they did not appear to me &s;o remarkable as to require taking any admea&s;urement; but they are &s;poken of by Mr Wallis, as being very &s;ingular, and as I did not traver&s;e all the &s;ides of the mountain, perhaps tho&s;e of greater con&s;equence e&s;caped my ob|&s;ervation; but conceiving that they may be marks of antiquity, among other matters, I will tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader with de&s;criptions of tho&s;e circular buildings in the northern parts of this i&s;land, which have been vi&s;ited by learned travellers; and perhaps &s;ome future vi&s;itor of the Cheviots may be induced to make a narrower &s;earch, and more correct inve&s;tigation. But before I proceed thereto, I will con&s;ider &s;ome others of Mr Bryant's opinions, which relate generally to my &s;ubject of <HI>Yever|ing Bell,</HI> and particularly to the circular remains.</P>
<P>Mr Bryant informs, <Q>that the&s;e mounts were not only in <HI>Greece,</HI> but in <HI>Egypt, Syria,</HI> and mo&s;t parts of the world. They were ge|nerally formed by art, being compo&s;ed of earth rai&s;ed very high; which was &s;loped gradually, and with great exactne&s;s: and the top of all was crowned with <HI>a fair tower.</HI> The &s;ituation of the&s;e build|ings made them be looked upon as places of great &s;afety: and the reverence in which they were held, added to the &s;ecurity. On the&s;e accounts they were the repo&s;itories of much wealth and trea&s;ure: in times of peril they were crowded with things of value. In <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> was a temple named <HI>Azara,</HI> which the <HI>Parthian</HI> plundered, and is
<PB N="253" REF="289">
&s;aid to have carried off ten thou&s;and talents. To &s;uch as the&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> alludes, when he makes his beloved &s;ay, <HI>'I am a wall, and my brea&s;ts like towers.'</HI> Though the word <HI>Cumah</HI> or <HI>Comah,</HI> be generally ren|dered a wall; yet I &s;hould think, that in this place it &s;ignified the ground, which the wall &s;urrounded: an inclo&s;ure &s;acred to <HI>Cham,</HI> the <HI>Sun,</HI> who was particularly wor&s;hipped in &s;uch places. Another pa&s;|&s;age in <HI>Solomon: 'We have a little &s;i&s;ter, and &s;he hath no brea&s;ts. If &s;he be a Comah, we will build upon her a palace of &s;ilver.'</HI> What is then termed a wall, was a <HI>Comah</HI> or <HI>high place,</HI> which had been of old erected to the <HI>Sun,</HI> by the <HI>Jebu&s;ites.</HI> The ground &s;et apart for &s;uch u&s;e was generally <HI>oval;</HI> and towards one extremity of the long dia|meter, as it were in the focus, were the&s;e <HI>mounds and towers</HI> erected. For there were many of the&s;e <HI>towers,</HI> where they taught <HI>a&s;tronomy, mu&s;ic,</HI> and other <HI>&s;ciences.</HI> The&s;e places were likewi&s;e <HI>courts of judica|ture,</HI> where ju&s;tice was admini&s;tred.</Q></P>
<P>In Mr Pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides, we have the following ac|counts of erections of this kind, near Inverne&s;s. <Q>Vi&s;it the celebrated edifices attributed to the <HI>Danes:</HI> the fir&s;t is placed about two miles from the mouth of the valley of <HI>Glen Elg.</HI> The more entire &s;ide ap|pears of a mo&s;t elegant taper form: the pre&s;ent height is thirty feet &s;ix inches; but in 1722, &s;ome Goth purloined from the top &s;even feet and a half, under pretence of applying the materials to certain public buildings. By the appearance of &s;ome ruins that now lie at the ba&s;e, and which have fallen off &s;ince that time, I believe three feet more may be added to the height, which will make the whole about forty-one feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The whole is built with dry walls, but the cour&s;es mo&s;t beautifully di&s;po&s;ed. On one &s;ide is a breach of at lea&s;t one quarter of the cir|cumference. The diameter within is thirty-three feet and a half, taken at the di&s;tance of ten feet from the bottom: the wall in that part is &s;even feet four inches thick, but is formed thinner and thinner till it reaches the top, who&s;e breadth I forgot to cau&s;e to be mea&s;ured. The in&s;ide wall is quite perpendicular, &s;o that the inner diameter mu&s;t have been equal from top to bottom: but the exterior wall &s;lopes, increa&s;ing in thickne&s;s till it reaches the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the thickne&s;s of the wall were two galleries, one at the lower part; about &s;ix feet two inches high, and two feet five wide at the bot|tom,
<PB N="254" REF="290">
narrowing to the top, flagged and al&s;o covered over with great flat &s;tones. This gallery ran quite round, and that horizontally, but was divided into apartments: in one place with &s;ix flags placed equidi&s;tant from each other, and were acce&s;&s;ible above by means of a hole from another gallery. Into the lower were two entrances, (before the ruin of the other &s;ide there had been two others) above each of the&s;e en|trances were a row of holes, running up to the top, divided by flags, appearing like &s;helves: near the top was a circle of projecting &s;tones, which probably were intended to hold the beams that formed the roof: above is another hole like the former. None of the&s;e openings pa&s;s through, for there is not the lea&s;t appearance of window or open|ing on the out&s;ide wall. All the&s;e holes are &s;quare; are too &s;mall to admit the human body, &s;o were probably de&s;igned to lodge arms, and different other matters, &s;ecure from wet or harm.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Over the fir&s;t gallery was another, divided from it only by flags. This al&s;o went round, but was free from any &s;eparation; the height was five feet &s;ix; only twenty inches wide at bottom. This was al&s;o covered with flags at top.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At a di&s;tance above, in the broken &s;ides of the wall, was another hole, but it &s;eemed too &s;mall for a gallery. The a&s;cent was not &s;afe, &s;o could not venture up. The height was taken by a little boy who &s;crambled to the top.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The entrance was a &s;quare hole on the we&s;t &s;ide: before it were the remains of &s;ome building, with a narrow opening that led to the door. Almo&s;t contiguous to this entrance or portico, was a &s;mall circle formed of rude &s;tones, which was called the foundation of the Druids hou&s;es. It probably was formed for &s;ome religious purpo&s;e. I was told there were many others of this kind &s;cattered over the valley.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At le&s;s than a quarter of a mile di&s;tant from this, &s;tands the &s;econd tower on a little flat on the &s;ide of the hill. The form is &s;imilar, but the number of galleries differs: here are three; the lowe&s;t goes entirely round; but at the ea&s;t end is an aperture now of &s;mall depth, but once of &s;uch extent, that the goats which &s;heltered in it were often lo&s;t: on that account the entrance was filled with &s;tones. This is &s;ix feet high, four feet two inches broad, and flagged above and below.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="291"><Q>A &s;econd gallery was of the &s;ame height, but the breadth of the floor only three feet five.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The third gallery was of &s;uch difficult acce&s;s, that I did not at|tempt to get up: it was &s;o narrow and &s;o low, that it was with diffi|culty, that the child who climbed to it could creep through.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The pre&s;ent height of this tower is only twenty-four feet five inches, the diameter thirty: the thickne&s;s of the lower part of the wall, twelve feet four.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I could not perceive any traces of the winding &s;tairs mentioned by Mr Gordon: but the&s;e buildings have &s;uffered greatly &s;ince that gen|tleman &s;aw them: I have no doubt of his accuracy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e were in all probability places of defence, but it is difficult to &s;ay any thing on the &s;ubject of their origin, or by what nation they were erected. They are called here, <HI>Cai&s;teal Teilbali,</HI> or the <HI>Ca&s;tle of Teilba,</HI> built by a mother for her four &s;ons, as tradition, delivered in this tran&s;lation of four Er&s;e lines, informs:
<Q><L>"My four &s;ons a fair clan</L>
<L>"I left in the &s;traith of one Glen.</L>
<L>"My Malcomb my lovely Conil</L>
<L>"My Telve my Troddan.</L></Q>
There had been two others, now totally demoli&s;hed, and each named after her children. Mr Gordon mentions others of this kind, one of which is called the <HI>Dune</HI> of <HI>Dornadilla,</HI> from an imaginary Prince, who reigned 260 years before the chri&s;tian aera.</Q>&mdash;By a paragraph &s;ome time ago in Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t, and from a note given by Mr Pennant, which he &s;ays he had from the Edinburgh Magazine, this place is de&s;cribed; part of which I will tran&s;cribe, as pertinent to my pre&s;ent object.</P>
<P><Q>The entrance is a very low and narrow door, to pa&s;s through which one is obliged to &s;toop much: but perhaps the ground may have been rai&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t erection. When one is got in and placed in the center, it is open over head. All round the &s;ides of the walls are ranged &s;tone &s;helves, one above another, like the &s;helves in a circular
<PB N="256" REF="292">
beaufet, reaching from near the bottom to the top. There is &s;ome remains of an awkward &s;tair-ca&s;e. Some years &s;ince I happened, at an auction of books in London, to look into a French book contain|ing Gauli&s;h Antiquities, and there I &s;aw a print of the remains of a Druidic temple in France, which greatly re&s;embles the tower I am &s;peaking of, having like &s;helves in it. And reading a late pamphlet on the antiquity of the Iri&s;h language, I think I can partly trace the origin of the name Dornadilla.&mdash;Dorn means a round &s;tone; &s;o that Abdorn would mean the round &s;tone of the prie&s;ts; na is of, and Di is God; ulla means a place of devotion: &s;o that Dor-na-di-ulla will &s;ignify the round &s;tone place of the wor&s;hip of God; or perhaps it might allude to &s;ome round &s;tone pre&s;erved within, as a &s;acred em|blem of Divinity.</Q></P>
<P>From the whole of the&s;e quotations I would determine, that by the name of <HI>Yevering Bell,</HI> or <HI>Bel-ad-Gebrin,</HI> is implied <HI>a &s;acred mount</HI> con|&s;ecrated to the adoration of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and u&s;ed in fire wor&s;hip. Of this the <HI>kairn</HI> is a corroborating proof. The circumvallation &s;hews, by its &s;imilarity to tho&s;e &s;poken of, that the per&s;ons who u&s;ed this mount for their religious rites, derived tho&s;e rites from the &s;ame &s;ource as tho&s;e quoted, and fixes the antiquity of <HI>Yevering Bell</HI> to very remote ages. It is a point not to be doubted, that <HI>Yevering</HI> for &s;ome time was the re&s;i|dence of the <HI>Saxon Kings</HI> in the Heptarchy. If we &s;hould carry the an|tiquity of <HI>Yevering Bell</HI> no further, we will find its appropriation then to religious offices, as probable as in a more di&s;tant antiquity. The Saxons brought with them many Ea&s;tern cu&s;toms: they wor&s;hipped the <HI>Sun,</HI> had their <HI>high places,</HI> and rites of <HI>fire wor&s;hip</HI> and &s;acrifice. As to my own judgment, I &s;hould be inclined to fix the antiquity of this place to their aera. The <HI>Druid tribes</HI> have left us &s;uch imperfect evi|dence of their cu&s;toms, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix any thing po&s;itively there. It is even mo&s;t probable this was of <HI>Saxon origin,</HI> from its vi|cinity to the royal re&s;idence, and the greatne&s;s of the work. The cir|cular buildings have never been fixed to any particular people: their con&s;tructors &s;till remain undi&s;covered. The circles of ruins on the &s;ides of <HI>Yevering Bell,</HI> may have been &s;imilar to tho&s;e vi&s;ited by Mr Pennant; it is probable the&s;e circular erections were the towers of the prie&s;ts, who there taught the principles of their religion and the elements of natural philo&s;ophy; and that there they &s;tored up the trea&s;ures of the country in times of public danger, which from the veneration paid by all peo|ple to tho&s;e &s;acred places were inviolable. Be&s;ides, they were well cal|culated
<PB N="257" REF="293">
for defence, upon a&s;&s;ault. The circles formed by rude and un|hewn &s;tones, found in many parts of the North, have been regarded by all Antiquaries as places of public convocation, where ju&s;tice was di&s;|pen&s;ed. The number of &s;tones might denote the tribes or di&s;tricts un|der the care of each Druid, as the I&s;raelites numbered their tribes by &s;uch columns at the pa&s;&s;age of Jordan.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from the <HI>Bell,</HI> to the &s;outhward is a large <HI>kairn</HI> of &s;tones, called <HI>Tom Tallon's Grave:</HI> but who this per&s;onage was, no hi&s;|tory informs us.</P>
<P>Some mountains near <HI>Yevering,</HI> have the names of <HI>Newton Ea&s;t and We&s;t Tor.</HI> On one of them is a <HI>kairn</HI> of &s;tones, al&s;o on the we&s;tern point of <HI>Cheviot,</HI> and on a mount called <HI>Whitlau,</HI> all in view of each other. The&s;e <HI>Tors</HI> are &s;aid by &s;everal authors, to be held by the <HI>Saxons</HI> &s;acred to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Mr Bryant's remarks are, <Q><HI>Tor</HI> is an <HI>hill</HI> or <HI>tower.</HI> They were called by the <HI>Amonians,</HI> who fir&s;t erected them, <HI>Tar</HI> and <HI>Tor;</HI> the &s;ame as the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> which &s;ignified both a <HI>hill</HI> and <HI>tower.</HI> The words <HI>Tar, Tor,</HI> and <HI>Tarit,</HI> &s;hew that they implied <HI>temples,</HI> and dedications to the <HI>Sun.</HI></Q>&mdash;He in&s;tances many facts to prove this po&s;ition, among which are, <Q><HI>Tor-on,</HI> a place in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> literally &s;ignifying the <HI>tower of the Sun.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>Tir-it,</HI> of the &s;ame &s;ig|nification, and <HI>Tor-ambi,</HI> the <HI>oracular tower of Ham.</HI></Q>&mdash;He has in another place this &s;entence, <Q>I will therefore &s;ay &s;o much in further|ance of the <HI>Briti&s;h Antiquarian,</HI> as to inform him, that names of places, e&s;pecially of hills, promontories, and rivers, are of long du|ration, and &s;uffer little change. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of every thing which was e&s;teemed at all &s;acred; &s;uch as temples, towers, and high mounds of earth, which in early times were u&s;ed for altars.</Q>&mdash;And in another place, <Q>There was another name current among the <HI>Amo|nians,</HI> by which they called their <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>high places.</HI> This was <HI>Taph,</HI> which at times was rendered <HI>Tuph, Toph,</HI> and <HI>Taphos.</HI> The <HI>Amonians,</HI> when they &s;ettled in <HI>Greece,</HI> rai&s;ed many <HI>Tupha</HI> in different parts; but as it was u&s;ual in ancient times, to bury per&s;ons of di&s;tinction under heaps of earth formed in this fa&s;hion, the&s;e <HI>Tapha</HI> came to &s;ig|nify <HI>tombs;</HI> and almo&s;t all the <HI>&s;acred mounds</HI> built for religious pur|po&s;es, were looked upon as monuments of decea&s;ed heroes;</Q> of which he gives many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have dwelt too long on this &s;ubject, though an intere&s;ting one to tho&s;e who may hereafter vi&s;it the&s;e places.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="294">I mu&s;t not quit this country without remarking, that as we advanced towards the boundary of the kingdoms, the hills were cloathed with a &s;ingular verdure, affording fine &s;heep walks; and the flocks and herds were numerous. The cottages of the lower cla&s;s of people are deplorable, compo&s;ed of upright timbers fixed in the ground, the inter&s;tices wattled and plai&s;tered with mud: the roofs, &s;ome thatched, and others covered with turf; one little piece of gla&s;s to admit the beams of day; and a hearth &s;tone on the ground, for the peat and turf fire. Within, there was ex|hibited a &s;cene, to touch the feelings of the heart: de&s;cription &s;ickens on the &s;ubject, and a tear of pity blots out the moving line, which &s;trives to depict. I wi&s;hed for &s;ome of the di&s;contented great ones, who, palled with luxury, de&s;pi&s;e their palaces, to change the &s;cene for a little, ju&s;t time &s;ufficient to gain conviction, that the cottager and crowned head are both of one &s;pecie of animals, and of one race. The damp earth, the naked rafters, the breeze-di&s;turbed embers, and di&s;tracted &s;moke that i&s;&s;ues from the hearth, moved by contrary bla&s;ts, breaking through a thou&s;and crannies; the mid-day gloom, the wretched couch, the wooden uten&s;ils that &s;carce retain the name of convenience, the do|me&s;tic bea&s;t that &s;talls with its ma&s;ter, the di&s;con&s;olate poultry that mourn on the rafters, form a group of objects for a great man's con|templation.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of abject countenance, and mi&s;erably cloathed, &s;eeming to confe&s;s the lowe&s;t degree of poverty. The employment of the men is in the field; mo&s;t of them are &s;hepherds or herd&s;men. The corn land, which is very little in quantity compared with the meadows and grazing grounds, lays mingled with the other over the open faces of the vales, without any fences; to protect which, many an indolent herd&s;man &s;tands for hours wrapped up in his plaid, hanging over a &s;taff, half animated; or otherwi&s;e laying pro&s;trate upon the ground. During the time he is engaged in this duty, if he had a &s;pade put in his hand, and was broke into the rules of indu&s;try, he might be mo&s;t u&s;efully employed: he could fence the ground which he tends, in the time he &s;pends in herding it: but evil cu&s;toms, when they corre&s;pond with habitual indolence, are as hard to be eradicated, as to move a mountain&mdash;a long &s;eries of applications and labour, and the redoubled effects of example and experience, mu&s;t effect it. In con&s;equence of this &s;tupid cu&s;tom, the farmer is nece&s;&s;arily obliged to keep a multitude of &s;ervants. Their wages are paid in the products of the land&mdash;grain,
<PB N="259" REF="295">
wool, maintenance of &s;heep and cattle; very few money payments be|ing u&s;ed.</P>
<P>From the openne&s;s of the country, the traveller is con&s;equently per|plexed with cro&s;s roads, where not a guide-po&s;t has been known &s;ince the creation: to remedy this evil, intelligence mu&s;t be gained from one of the&s;e herds; and it is remarkable, that there is a ferocity and un|cultivated fullenne&s;s of mind in tho&s;e two-legged animals, which &s;carce confe&s;&s;es civilization enough to direct a &s;tranger on his way. When you obtain in&s;tructions, it is in a manner as he would chace a bea&s;t from tre&s;pa&s;s. I cannot forbear comparing the countenance of the lower cla&s;s of Engli&s;h, in the northern counties, with that of the Scotch&mdash;I do not draw my remarks &s;olely from my pre&s;ent tour, but through ob&s;ervations made in many little plea&s;ure jaunts in Scotland&mdash;Though you perceive the mo&s;t abject poverty in the lowe&s;t rank of the Scotch peo|ple, yet even under tho&s;e weeds of di&s;tre&s;s, there is &s;een a &s;ingular open|ne&s;s and benevolence of countenance. By &s;ome it may be objected, that this ari&s;es from their &s;ervility, and the&s;e are no other than feigned looks of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Ari&s;e from what it will, &s;uch countenance carries more of the character of humanity, than the proud &s;ternne&s;s, and brutal in|&s;olence, which mark tho&s;e who boa&s;t a &s;avage liberty. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ervility &s;tamps the countenance with abject timidity, which is not written on the Scotch features&mdash;a generous nature, and the liberality of a mind enlarged with education, are rather the givers of &s;uch openne&s;s and benevolence of look. Almo&s;t every Scotch village is ble&s;&s;ed with a free &s;chool. You will find &s;hepherds on the Scotch hills, familiar with the poets and hi&s;torians of Rome and Greece: &s;uch familiarity introduces an adoption of principles and &s;entiments; and from thence we &s;ee in the&s;e poor people, the maxims of mind which graced the illu&s;trious names of old. Can we wonder then at the de&s;pa|rity there appears in the lower cla&s;s of the two nations?&mdash;But there is another &s;ource from whence a part of this complai&s;ancy and ho&s;pitality of the lower Scotch may be deduced: they are &s;trict in their religious principles; they are punctual attendants on public wor&s;hip; they hold with great &s;acredne&s;s their ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath day; mo&s;t of their pa&s;tors are not only rigid in their example, but arduous in their duty and admini&s;tration: among&s;t the people there is a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e conceived, even in the lowe&s;t minds, of man's duty to his God. The rever&s;e is &s;o con|&s;picuous in the Engli&s;h, that the compari&s;on is &s;carce required. So far from perceiving a religious principle in the lower cla&s;&s;es, &s;ome of them
<PB N="260" REF="296">
have not even been informed of their Redeemer; thou&s;ands have never entered a place of wor&s;hip; the Sabbath is di&s;tingui&s;hed only as a day of idlene&s;s, in which gaming and drinking are pur&s;ued; many of the teachers of the go&s;pel, with an indolence and aver&s;ion apparent in their whole carriage, perform as a &s;tale and &s;tupid ta&s;k the offices of the church. Men are influenced by example; evil example contaminates the mo&s;t where the minds are mo&s;t illiterate; weak men take many of their vices by adoption: if it were not for our new &s;ectaries, our ram|bling preachers, the name of God would not be promulged to one-tenth part of England's inhabitants. It is true they teach his laws, as the laws of the God of terrors: it is better they &s;hould admini&s;ter to him with the horrors of hell, than there be no mini&s;try. We have reformed the church, till we have expelled the &s;pirit of prayer: we have refined the pulpit, till nothing but the grace of declamation remains: and our church manners are poli&s;hed into that exqui&s;ite in&s;ipidity, that if it were not for tithes, the major part of the pari&s;h would forget the holy men of God.</P>

<P>Within a little di&s;tance of Copeland, three remarkable battles were fought: the one on the plains of <HI>Milfield,</HI> where a body of the Scotch
<PB N="261" REF="297">
were defeated before the battle of Branxton by <HI>Sir William Bulmer of Brancepeth,</HI> who commanded the forces of the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham. The Scots lay in ambu&s;h among the broom which then covered the plain.</P>
<P><HI>Milfield,</HI> now a little village, was the re&s;idence of the Saxon Kings of <HI>Bernicia,</HI> after the death of <HI>Edwin.</HI></P>
<P>Another battle was fought at a place called <HI>Haltwell Sweire,</HI> where <HI>Sir Henry Percy,</HI> brother to the &s;ixth Earl of Northumberland, was de|feated in the fifth year of the reign of Queen Mary, 1558, by a troop of the Scots under the command of the <HI>Earl of Bothwell,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 1000 hor&s;e. Percy's cavalry were thrown into confu&s;ion by a di&s;charge of fire arms, to which they were not well trained.</P>
<P>The third battle was at Broomridge,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place of this battle is treated with great uncertainty by many authors: the name u&s;ed by <HI>Fordun</HI> is <HI>Brunauburgh; Camden,</HI> from its &s;imilarity, fixes it at <HI>Broomrigs.</HI> The many lines, brea&s;tworks, and intrenchments, te&s;tify that this was the place of &s;ome great action.</NOTE> where a confu&s;ion of lines and intrenchments are yet to be &s;een.

<P><HI>Mailro&s;s</HI> being the &s;eminary from whence &s;prang the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of the See of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> which con&s;titutes &s;o material a part of the church antiquities of this county; and as the great patron, &s;aint, the holy <HI>St Cuthbert,</HI> was educated there, and from thence brought to <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> it &s;eemed of con&s;equence, that I &s;hould view the &s;eat, from whence i&s;&s;ued &s;o much to exerci&s;e my attention, in the remaining part of the tour, I had thus far pro&s;ecuted. I determined to vi&s;it <HI>Mailro&s;s,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the village of <HI>Pa&s;ton,</HI> formerly belonging to the family of Selbys. On an adjoining hill, called the Harelaw, (the name implying the &s;ta|tion of an army) is a circular intrenchment with a double rampier and
<PB N="262" REF="298">
fo&s;s. From thence there is a fine pro&s;pect of the vale, where it gave us great plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve the new modes of hu&s;bandry taking place&mdash; turnips cultivated in drill &s;owing, with hor&s;e and hand hoeing prac|ti&s;ed. There is a very great want of fences in this part of the coun|try: habit and cu&s;tom are only to be &s;ubdued by time and example.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome few miles beyond the boundary of the kingdoms, and gaining an eminence above <HI>Tweeddale,</HI> we had a view of <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> and the rich exten&s;ive vale which borders the river. Having travelled near 18 miles in the rude and mountainous country from <HI>Wooler,</HI> where we &s;eldom had in &s;ight a cultivated valley or fertile tract of any con&s;e|quence, except at <HI>Pa&s;ton,</HI> or the plain of <HI>Milfield,</HI> but all the mighty &s;cene was filled with &s;tupendous mountains, on who&s;e &s;ummits re&s;ted an ince&s;&s;ant gloom and driving rain; and after climbing tho&s;e lofty &s;teeps, in &s;earch of evidences of antiquity, and traver&s;ing boundle&s;s wa&s;tes, the pre&s;ent pro&s;pect gave us unu&s;ual plea&s;ure. The vale before us abounded in corn, and the extended &s;cene po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the variety that nature exhibits; the di&s;tant grounds were lifted up in a wild arrangement of mountains. By the margin of the river, the yellow fields were &s;o mixed with the meads, as to re&s;emble flowers of gold, wrought on the green robe of happy Tweed. Few fences &s;ubdivide the vale: but here and there fine woods are &s;cattered; before us lay the delightful town of Kel&s;o; on the left hand, a cultivated country, through which the Tweed flows in meanders; on who&s;e banks Sir John Douglas's, and the palace of the Duke of Roxburgh, with their exten|&s;ive woodlands, are beautifully di&s;po&s;ed. The Helton Mountains, three fine conic eminences, form obeli&s;ks at the di&s;tance of 15 miles up the vale; over which, and on each &s;ide, mountains behind mountains are &s;een, not united, but di&s;tinctly &s;urging from little valleys, which open around their ba&s;es, then glowing with &s;treams of yellow light. This hue was delicately mellowed by the azure tinge of the hills, which formed the horizon. The &s;ame mountainous ground was in the di&s;tant pro&s;pect in front; only differing in this, that the eye penetrated the cul|tivated vales, at the feet of the hills, which &s;tand at a much greater di&s;tance from each other, and did not appear thrown together as in the longer line of per&s;pective. To the right we viewed the &s;eat of Dr John&s;ton, embowered in thick woods. Down the river the vale is more contracted, and le&s;s di&s;tant pro&s;pect was taken in: the town of Cold&s;tream was di&s;tinctly viewed, with a multitude of inferior villages; above which, the &s;eat of Lord Hume, with the ri&s;ing plantations around

<P>We con&s;tantly regretted the want of fences in this tour; they would give a great grace to the banks of Tweed, by inter&s;ecting the rich &s;cene. The advantage they would be of to the country is obvious; they would check the &s;everities of winter, and re&s;i&s;t that raking bla&s;t, which, when unoppo&s;ed, &s;hears the exten&s;ive grounds wherever it pa&s;&s;es in the &s;pring of the year; con&s;equently they would forward the progre&s;s of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>We de&s;cended to the town of</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>KELSO,</HEAD>
<P>which lays on the northern banks of Tweed; and to which we had ac|ce&s;s by a fine &s;tone bridge of &s;ix arches.</P>
<P>From the &s;outhern banks of the river, the town with its invirons has the mo&s;t picture&s;que appearance: where I &s;tood to ob&s;erve its beauties, I had the bridge on my right; an excellent though plain &s;tructure of modern work, &s;tretching acro&s;s a fine river of tran&s;parent water, gently curling over a pebbly channel. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which is banked in, &s;tands the modern and elegant Man&s;ion of Mrs Dixon, a widow Lady; a &s;quare hewn-&s;tone &s;tructure, placed in the mid&s;t of a garden, opening to the river; ornamented with a &s;mall Gothic temple, a green|hou&s;e and &s;tove; with &s;tatues di&s;po&s;ed on the gra&s;s plots, which were inter&s;ected with gravel walks and flower knots. Over this modern and fa&s;hionable &s;cene, an augu&s;t pile, in all the &s;olemnity of ruin, frowns maje&s;tically&mdash;an old abbey &s;tands near this man&s;ion, a lofty &s;tructure, built in the heavie&s;t of the Gothic order&mdash;two round towers of the &s;outh limb of the cro&s;s, &s;urmounted by a part of the center tower, formed the a&s;pect on which we looked: the windows are &s;mall, and the whole edifice gloomy.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange what di&s;&s;imilar ideas &s;ometimes &s;trike the imagination: as I gazed upon this &s;cene, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, Thus Charactacus, in the great rever&s;e of his fortune, looked with contempt on the pageantry and pomp of his Roman conquerors: There could not be a finer contra&s;t
<PB N="264" REF="301">
than in the&s;e two &s;tructures. The town of Kel&s;o crowded the back ground of our pro&s;pect. To the left the view opened upon the vale, terminated by the noble woods which adjoin the &s;eat of the Duke of Roxburgh: to the right, through the arches of the bridge, were &s;een fine perpen|dicular rocks, crowned with &s;tately trees on the river's brink.</P>
<P>We entered Kel&s;o, which is clean and well built: Mr Pennant &s;ays it is much after the manner of a Flemi&s;h town. It hath a &s;pacious &s;quare market-place, with a town-hou&s;e piazza'd beneath, for the con|venience of the market; the number of inhabitants about 3000; the weekly market con&s;iderable, va&s;t quantities of corn being &s;old here, though chiefly by &s;ample. The Inn was elegant, the people obliging, and the attendants particularly alert and conde&s;cending.</P>
<P>Kel&s;o is a borough of the Duke of Roxburgh, and is governed by his Bailiff. It is not remarkable for any great manufactory or trade, but appears to be the place of re&s;idence of many people of ea&s;y fortune. Some part of the great &s;tocks of wool furni&s;hed by this country, is ma|nufactured here into cloths called plains, but dre&s;&s;ed in England. There is al&s;o a manufacture of white leather for the Edinburgh market.</P>
<P>The mona&s;tery here was founded by King David. During his brother Alexander's reign, he had brought over from Tyrone, in France, cer|tain Monks of a reformed order, founded by Bernard d'Abbeville, a man of high reputation for &s;anctity and &s;everity of life; the&s;e he &s;ettled fir&s;t at Selkirk with an ample revenue: afterwards making Roxburgh his re&s;idence, he removed his favourite Monks thither; and when he came to the Crown, built for them the abbey and mona&s;tery of Kel&s;o, and fixed them there on the 2d of May, 1128, having dedicated the church to the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangeli&s;t. Bernard the founder of this order, was a di&s;ciple of Robert d'Arbri&s;&s;er, founder of the order of Fontevraud, which by a con&s;titution almo&s;t peculiar to it|&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ted of both Monks and Nuns, and had an Abbe&s;s to govern the &s;ociety. Bernard founded the mona&s;tery of Tyrone in the year 1109, from which place his di&s;ciples derived their name. The habit of the Tyronen&s;ian Monks, was a light grey, but was afterwards changed to black. Fordun po&s;itively &s;ays, the&s;e Monks &s;ettled at Selkirk in 1109; but Symeon of Durham, that they were not placed there till 1113, and remained fifteen years. According to Fordun, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Abbots was as follows: Ralph, one of the Monks brought over from France,
<PB N="265" REF="302">
was the fir&s;t Abbot, but on the death of Bernard, returned to &s;ucceed him in the Abbacy of Tyrone; William &s;ucceeded to Selkirk, and on the death of Ralph, al&s;o returned to Tyrone, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to that Ab|bacy; Herbert &s;ucceeded William, and was the fir&s;t Abbot of Kel&s;o. It is pre&s;umed that David, who was a lover of the fine arts, as well as a patron of every national improvement, had in view, on his importing this colony from France, not only the advancement of religion, but al&s;o that of arts and &s;ciences, of which his &s;ubjects were in great need of cultivation, their only occupations, from the remote&s;t ages, having been the duty of &s;hepherds and the &s;ervice of the &s;word. In the Hi&s;tory of the Mona&s;tic Orders, we find, that Bernard the founder of the Tyro|nen&s;ians would have all &s;orts of handicrafts practi&s;ed in his mona&s;tery, as well to prevent the growth of idlene&s;s, which he e&s;teemed the mother of vice, as to procure nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;upport of life. Accordingly in this body were painters, carvers, joiners, &s;miths, ma&s;ons, vine-dre&s;&s;ers, and hu&s;bandmen, who were under the command of an Elder: and what they earned was put into a common &s;tock, for the mainte|nance of the hou&s;e.

<P>The abbey of Kel&s;o was built in the form of a Greek cro&s;s: the nave and quire are totally demoli&s;hed; the north and &s;outh ailes remain &s;tanding, being each about 20 paces in length. The walls are orna|mented with fal&s;e round arches, inter&s;ecting each other: the remains of the ea&s;tern end &s;hew a part of a fine open gallery. Two &s;ides of the

center tower are &s;tanding, now near 70 feet high, but have been much more lofty: it is galleried within, the pillars are clu&s;tered, the arches circular, with few members, and without any great ornament. The

north and &s;outh ends have an uniformity, bearing each two round towers, the centers ri&s;ing &s;harp to the roof: the north door way is formed by a circular arch, with various members falling behind each other, &s;up|ported on pila&s;ters; the windows and work above, very plain. Three bells now hang in the uppermo&s;t windows, this part of the nave having lately been u&s;ed for divine &s;ervice. We did but ju&s;t look into it; all pomp was utterly eradicated, and every degree of pageantry defaced. The windows of this abbey are of circular arches, and remarkably &s;mall, the whole mode of architecture &s;ingular, and unlike any &s;tructure I re|member to have &s;een in England: the walls are thick, and every where ponderous. There is a Gothic gloomine&s;s throughout the whole, that carries the appearance of a pri&s;on, rather than a hou&s;e of prayer; and yet the&s;e ruins have a countenance of &s;ullen &s;olemnity, which mingling with the beautiful &s;cene around, has a grand effect.</P>

<P><Q>I cannot leave Kel&s;o, without regretting my not arriving there in time to &s;ee the races, which had been the preceding week. The&s;e are founded not on the &s;ordid principles of gaming, or di&s;&s;ipation, or fraud, but on the beautiful ba&s;is of benevolence, and with the amiable view of conciliating the affections of two nations, where the good and the bad, common to every place, are only divided by a rill &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed: but prejudice for a time could find no merit but within its own narrow bourn. Some enlarged minds however, deter|mined to break the fa&s;cination of erroneous opinion, to mix with their fellow &s;ubjects, and to in&s;truct both the great vulgar and the &s;mall, that the northern and &s;outhern bounders of the Tweed, created in their inhabitants but a mere difference, without a di&s;tinction, and that virtue and good &s;en&s;e were equally common to both. At the&s;e races the Stewards are &s;elected from each nation: a Percy and a Dou|glas may now be &s;een hand in hand; the example of charity &s;preads, and may it &s;pread with all its &s;weet influences, to the remote&s;t corner of our i&s;land.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What plea&s;ing times, to tho&s;e that may be brought in contra&s;t! when every hou&s;e was made defen&s;ible, and each owner garri&s;oned again&s;t his neighbour; when revenge at one time dictated an inroad, and nece&s;&s;ity at another; when the mi&s;tre&s;s of a ca&s;tle has pre&s;ented her &s;ons with their &s;purs, to remind them that their larder was
<PB N="269" REF="306">
empty, and that by a <HI>forray</HI> they mu&s;t &s;upply it at the expence of the borderers; when every evening the &s;heep were taken from the hills, and the cattle from their pa&s;ture, to be &s;ecured in the lower floor from robbers prowling like wolves of prey, and the di&s;appointed thief found all in &s;afety, from the fears of the cautious owner.

The&s;e were the exploits of petty Robbers: but when Princes dictated an inroad, the con&s;equences bore a proportion to their rank.

It hap|pened that this was the day preceding the celebration of the &s;acrament, which gave a handle to the Doctor to take offence.

However a majority of the Se&s;&s;ion con|curred in a &s;entence, <Q>ordering the gentlemen to appear before the face of the congregation, to receive his public rebuke, and referred to the Pre&s;bytery what public cen&s;ure &s;hould be in|flicted.</Q> The gentlemen did not choo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ubmit to this public di&s;cipline, e&s;pecially from their violent per&s;ecutor, but appealed to the Pre&s;bytery who after full hearing and great deli|beration, unanimou&s;ly rever&s;ed the &s;entence, ordering the gentlemen to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a re|buke from the bar; on which they declared their &s;orrow for having met on that particular day, if it gave offence. Dr Wother&s;poon ill brooking the moderation of the Pre&s;bytery, in|&s;tantly threatened, if the Pre&s;bytery did not affirm the &s;entence of his Se&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o inflict a more &s;evere cen&s;ure, <Q>to print his &s;ermon, prefix the gentlemens names to it, and either bring them to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he wi&s;hed, or brand their names with infamy and di&s;grace through the Briti&s;h dominions.</Q> And immediately after the Pre&s;bytery's &s;entence, he did publi&s;h his &s;er|mon with a narrative prefixed, accu&s;ing the gentlemen by name, of all the crimes he had laid to their charge; but of which the Pre&s;bytery had unanimou&s;ly acquitted them; and it was ad|verti&s;ed to be &s;old in every corner of Scotland, where any of the gentlemen had any connections, Pai&s;ley, Gla&s;gow, Edinburgh, Sterling, &amp;c.

It is told, to the eternal di&s;grace of this Legate, that in a Council at Lon|don, having declaimed bitterly again&s;t the &s;in of a Prie&s;t, who had ri&s;en from the &s;ide of an Harlot to con&s;ecrate the Ho&s;t; he was found him&s;elf the following night in bed with an Harlot.</NOTE> of Pope Honorius, came to the Scotti&s;h King at Roxburgh, in the year 1125, to determine the controver&s;y touching the Primacy of York over the Scotti&s;h church. In 1126, King David returning from the Court of England, was attended to Roxburgh by Thur&s;tan Archbi&s;hop of York, Ralph Bi&s;hop of Durham, and Algar Prior of St Cuthbert's convent in Durham.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smith's Appendage to Bede, p. 764.</NOTE></P>
<P>King David I. made this the place of his re&s;idence, during the reign of his brother Alexander. Hither he brought his favourite Monks of Tyrone, from Selkirk, before he placed them at Kel&s;o, and built the ab|bey there. He added to the &s;trength of the place, increa&s;ed its fortifi|cations, and made it one of the chief bulwarks of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Malcolm Macbeth, who pretended to be the &s;on of Earl Angus, and was in arms again&s;t his Sovereign King David in 1234, was impri&s;oned in the Tower of Roxburgh.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="310">By the Chronicle of Mailro&s;s it appears, that the church of St James, at Roxburgh, was dedicated the 17th of April, 1234.</P>
<P>King David was the great patron of every national improvement: he ob&s;erved the example of Lewis le Gros, in civil and commercial e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, and granted many charters of incorporation to his cities and burghs. The burgh laws he cau&s;ed to be framed from the remarks made by learned men, &s;ent by him for the purpo&s;e into foreign &s;tates, to reap the &s;pirit and efficacy of each con&s;titution. It is probable that Roxburgh was one of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e communities in Scotland; for in an ancient manu&s;cript copy of the burgh laws, of which David was the undoubted author, the title prefixed declares them to be the laws and cu&s;toms of the four burghs, viz. Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh, and Sterling. A further evidence that the&s;e were the fir&s;t royal burghs, is in the court kept by the King's Chamberlain, where his office appears to give him juri&s;diction over all the King's burghs; the court being called <HI>the court of the four burghs,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ted of Delegates from the burghs above mentioned, three or four from each burgh, who by virtue of the Chamberlain's &s;ummons, a&s;&s;embled annually at Haddington, where all appeals from the peculiar courts of each &s;ingle burgh were heard and finally determined.</P>
<P>The confirmatory charter of King Malcolm to Kel&s;o, dated 1159, was given at Roxburgh. It appears by this charter, that the King made Roxburgh his re&s;idence, as he frequently attended divine &s;ervice at the church at Kel&s;o; for he confirms to that church all the offerings made by him&s;elf and his attendants, when&s;oever on &s;olemnities or other days he heard the &s;ervice of God in that church. The populou&s;ne&s;s of Rox|burgh and the country in the neighbourhood, may be inferred from the mention of churches in that place, granted to the Kel&s;o convent, as freely as they had been held by Acceline the Archdeacon, and which churches &s;eem di&s;tinct from the then lately erected church of St James. The &s;ame appears from the grant of 20 chalders, partly corn and partly meal, (inter farinam &amp; frumentum) to be paid out of the Roxburgh mills, which probably was the e&s;timate of the amount of the &s;eventh part of the mills granted in David's charter to the abbey of Selkirk. Mention is al&s;o made of a new town of Roxburgh.</P>
<P>In 1197, the rebellious Harold Earl of Caithne&s;s was confined in Roxburgh. This perfidious Earl having delivered Torphin his &s;on as
<PB N="274" REF="311">
an ho&s;tage for his future fidelity, by his repeated trea&s;ons, occa&s;ioned him to become a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of his King, who in his wrath being devoid of humanity, gave the innocent youth up to the mo&s;t dreadful tortures and excruciating death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His eyes were bored out, and his genitals torn off.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1209, William the Lion a&s;&s;embled a great army at Roxburgh to oppo&s;e King John, who had approached the borders, and lay at Nor|ham; but ho&s;tilities were prevented by a timely convention and a truce.</P>
<P>In 1215, King John, incen&s;ed again&s;t the northern Barons for their doing homage to King Alexander II. at Felton, marched northward in the middle of winter, and laid the country wa&s;te with fire and &s;word, exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t cruelties on the di&s;tracted inhabitants. He burnt the towns of Milford, Morpeth, Alnwick, Wark, and Roxburgh, in this horrid expedition.</P>
<P>In 1239, Roxburgh appears to have been re&s;tored; for here King Alexander II. celebrated his marriage, on the 4th of March in that year, with the daughter of Ingelram de Conci, and on the 4th of September, 1241, the Queen brought forth a &s;on here, Alexander, who &s;ucceeded to the Crown of Scotland.</P>
<P>In 1255, Roxburgh was the place of refuge for King Alexander III. and his young Queen, who had been prohibited con&s;ummation of their marriage by the guardians of the kingdom: of which complaint had been &s;ent to King Henry III. her father, wherein &s;he &s;et forth the hard|&s;hips &s;he underwent from the guardians, who held her in &s;trict confine|ment, refu&s;ed her the attendants and maids &s;he cho&s;e, and debarred her from the embraces of her hu&s;band. The Earl of Glouce&s;ter, with others &s;ent by King Henry, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Earl of Dunbar and his ad|herents, &s;urprized the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the per&s;ons of the King and Queen, conveyed them under a &s;trong guard to Roxburgh, where the Queen's di&s;tre&s;&s;es were relieved, although her royal &s;pou&s;e was then only 14 years of age.</P>
<P>Prince Edward, &s;on to Henry III. when on an expedition again&s;t the northern rebels who were in combination with John de Ve&s;cy, after his forfeiture of Alnwick, proceeded to Roxburgh in the year 1266, where he was received with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of joy by the King
<PB N="275" REF="312">
and Queen of Scotland, attended on that occa&s;ion by a numerous body of the Scotch nobility.</P>
<P>The marriage of Alexander Prince of Scotland to the daughter of the Earl of Flanders, was celebrated here on the 9th of April, 1283, the nuptial fea&s;t being continued for 15 days with the greate&s;t magnificence.</P>
<P>King Edward I. in 1296, reduced the Ca&s;tle of Roxburgh, where he continued &s;everal days with his army; during which time he was rein|forced with 15,000 fre&s;h troops from Wales.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding year Edward having mu&s;tered his forces at New|ca&s;tle, with an army of 2000 heavy armed hor&s;e, 1200 light hor&s;e, and 100,000 foot, proceeded to the Scotch border. The Scotch army, which for a con&s;iderable time had laid before Roxburgh, in hopes of re&s;toring to his liberty the Bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, who was pri&s;oner there, hearing of &s;o great an army advancing, rai&s;ed the &s;iege. The relief brought by the Engli&s;h to the garri&s;on of Roxburgh Ca&s;tle was highly &s;ea&s;onable, for they were already reduced to great hard&s;hips; and the inhabitants of the town, from the circumvallation formed by the Scotch, were brought to great di&s;tre&s;s for want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On Shrove Tue&s;day, in the year 1313, the garri&s;on of Roxburgh in|dulging them&s;elves on that fe&s;tival in an impolitick &s;ecurity, were given up to riot and di&s;&s;ipation, when they were &s;urprized by Sir James Dou|glas, with a re&s;olute band, who having approached in di&s;gui&s;e, mounted the walls by ladders of ropes. The name of Douglas echoed through the place, and rou&s;ed the Engli&s;h from their fe&s;tivity and drunkenne&s;s, many of them falling under the &s;word of the a&s;&s;ailants. The Governor retired into the great tower with a few of his men, where after two days re&s;i&s;tance, having received a wound in his face by an arrow, he &s;urrendered the fortre&s;s. King Robert Bruce, on receiving intelligence of this exploit, &s;ent his brother Edward to demoli&s;h the fortifications, which he effected with great labour.</P>
<P>King Edward III. in 1334, having come to Newca&s;tle in quality of Supreme of Scotland, received the homage of Edward Baliol in a public and &s;olemn manner: at which time Baliol, as a recompence for the ex|pences King Edward had &s;u&s;tained in recovering and re&s;toring to him his inheritance, by letters patent alienated to him, among&s;t other things,
<PB N="276" REF="313">
the town, ca&s;tle, and county of Roxburgh, to be annexed to and incor|porated with the Crown of England for ever.</P>
<P>In 1341, we find Roxburgh again in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scotch, hav-been recovered by Sir Alexander Ram&s;ay for King David Bruce.</P>
<P>King Edward III. in 1356, received from Baliol a formal &s;urrender of his right to the Crown of Scotland. This he performed by the cere|mony of delivering his Crown, with &s;ome of the &s;oil of Scotland, at Roxburgh, where Edward re&s;ided &s;ome days. This King twice cele|brated his birth-day in this ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In 1372, George Dunbar Earl of March, accompanied by his brother the Earl of Murray, with a large body of their dependants, entered Rox|burgh at the time of the annual fair, and in revenge of the death of one of their followers, who was &s;lain the preceding year in an affray, &s;lew all the Engli&s;h they found in the town, plundered it of the great quan|tities of merchandize and goods which were collected there on the above occa&s;ion, and reduced the town to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>King James II. of Scotland, availing him&s;elf of a neglect in the Eng|li&s;h of attending a propo&s;ed convention for continuing the truce in 1460, rai&s;ed an army with great expedition, with which he advanced again&s;t Roxburgh. At the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault he took the town, and levelled it to the ground. A regular &s;iege was laid to the ca&s;tle. Here the Scotch King was joined by great reinforcements, among which was the Earl of Huntley with his followers. The King, for former &s;ervices, de&s;irous of honouring Huntley, &s;hewed him every mark of e&s;teem and royal fa|vour; he conducted him to the trenches, to ob&s;erve the di&s;charge of his artillery, one of which was remarkable for its &s;ize, and had the name of the Lion. The King took delight in attending the&s;e operations, in which he &s;hewed a di&s;tingui&s;hed intrepidity, but in the end lo&s;t his life thereby, one of his pieces of ordnance in this &s;iege, to which he had approached too near, bur&s;t in di&s;charging, whereby the Earl of Angus, who &s;tood near the King, was much wounded, at the in&s;tant that a &s;plinter broke the King's thigh and &s;truck him dead. This is the tragical circum&s;tance before quoted from Camden. The Queen with her elde&s;t &s;on, then a boy about &s;even years of age, is &s;aid to have been in the camp at the time of this dreadful cata&s;trophe. She &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock with heroic firmne&s;s, exhorted the Chiefs to de&s;i&s;t from unavail|ing
<PB N="277" REF="314">
lamentations, and to te&s;tify their reverence for their King's memory, by carrying on the &s;iege with redoubled vigour. Her exhortations had the de&s;ired effect, the be&s;iegers exerted their utmo&s;t efforts. The garri|&s;on finding them&s;elves reduced to extremities, &s;urrendered the fortre&s;s; and, as Redpath in his Border Hi&s;tory &s;ays, <Q>that the place which the Engli&s;h had held for more than 100 years, might thenceforth cea&s;e to be a center of rapine and violence, or a cau&s;e of future &s;trife be|tween the nations, the victors reduced it to a heap of ruins.</Q></P>
<P>We do not find that the fortre&s;s was re&s;tored, or that any repairs were made to it to render it tenable until 1547, when the Engli&s;h army led by the Protector, pa&s;&s;ing the Tweed after the battle of Mu&s;&s;elbrough, encamped on the plain over-again&s;t Kel&s;o, between the ruins of the an|cient Ca&s;tle of Roxburgh and the confluence of Tweed and Tiviot. The Protector ob&s;erving the &s;trong and convenient &s;ituation of this ruined fortre&s;s, determined to make it tenable. The breaches in part of the ancient walls were filled with bankings of turf, he having reduced the fortre&s;s in &s;ize, by ca&s;ting up deep trenches on the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends within, and fortified them with a wall. Patten's account of the&s;e re|pairs is in the following terms: <Q>That one great ditch of 20 feet broad, with depth accordingly, and a wall of like breadth, depth, and height, &s;hould be made cro&s;s within the ca&s;tle, from the one &s;ide wall to the other, and 40 foot from the we&s;t end; and that a like trench and wall &s;hould al&s;o be ca&s;t a-traver&s;e within, about a coit's ca&s;t from the ea&s;t end; and hereto that the ca&s;tle walls on either &s;ide, where need was, &s;hould be mended with turf, and made with loop|holes, as well for &s;hooting directly forwards as for flanking at hand.</Q> So intent was the Protector on this work, that he laboured at it with his own hands two hours every day whil&s;t it was going on, and his example was followed by mo&s;t of the principal men of his army. The place was made defen&s;ible in &s;ix days, and there was left in it a garri&s;on of 300 &s;oldiers and 200 pioneers, under Sir Ralph Bulmer.</P>
<P>Mr Pennant &s;ays, <Q>a large holly, &s;urrounded by a wall, marks the &s;pot where James II. fell;</Q> but it was not noted to me when I vi&s;ited the place.</P>
<P>Near to the &s;cite of Roxburgh are the confu&s;ed foundations of build|ings and one gate-way of excellent workman&s;hip, which denote the place where &s;tood a hou&s;e of Franci&s;cans.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="315">It is not po&s;&s;ible to tread this ground without the mo&s;t &s;erious re|flections: the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life, here &s;o remarkably experienced, furni&s;h the traveller with a crowd of ideas, producing melancholy de|terminations. Here, where this turf, now painted with flowers, is brow&s;ed by the flocks, once &s;tood a town flouri&s;hing in trade; where fe&s;tivity and mirth often engaged the wealthy inhabitants; where the royal pre&s;ence was encircled with the nobility of the land; where the &s;plendour of a court was di&s;played; where the royal nuptials and the birth of Princes made a kingdom joyful; where peace brought her olives to crown felicity:&mdash;and in rever&s;e of circum&s;tances, where the&s;e cattle graze, armed troops have held their deadly conflicts, the &s;oil has drank in the blood of heroes and nobles; even royalty has bled upon the&s;e plains; the &s;hoots of victory or the cries of di&s;tre&s;s have often di&s;tracted the&s;e now peaceful echoes which make re&s;pon&s;es to the bleating &s;heep; cannon have rent the confu&s;ed atmo&s;phere, and the clangour of mar&s;hal in&s;truments hath filled the gale, which now breathes mu&s;ic in the mur|muring groves; revenge, rapine, and innumerable crimes have cur&s;ed the ground I tread with every human &s;in. Avenging Providence at length hath razed the walls, con&s;cious of &s;uch iniquity; the haughty towers are levelled with the earth, the plough&s;hare hath gone over the paths of wicked ages, and all but the name of Roxburgh is clean done out.</P>
<P>As Roxburgh fell, &s;o have empires fallen; and though it is a reflec|tion which brings with it the acute&s;t &s;orrow, yet it mu&s;t be admitted, that when the accompli&s;hment of time is come, other empires mu&s;t &s;ink into oblivion. Power and magnificence are periodical, we know not which will be the next that yields in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Heaven grant that Britain by her virtues may merit the divine protection, and that her empire may &s;urvive to the late&s;t ages full of honour.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that not the lea&s;t traces remain to mark the place where &s;o large a town once &s;tood; a place &s;o eminent, and of &s;o great re&s;ort for trade, the re&s;idence of Kings, and the &s;eat of &s;uch con|ventions.</P>

<P><PB N="279" REF="316">Our road on the banks of Tweed led through a cultivated country, but ill fenced, and the modes of hu&s;bandry gradually growing wor&s;e as we proceeded. We pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of Colonel Mac Dougle, &s;ituate on the north banks of Tweed; a hand&s;ome Man&s;ion, on the brink of a &s;teep de&s;cent; in the front a terrace, and gra&s;s &s;lopes laid out with ta&s;te, and well kept; the hou&s;e &s;heltered by plantations to the north and we&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="280" REF="317">This camp, or rather fort, hath been formed from a natural emi|nence; the crown is exactly circular, and level with a rampier of earth on the verge, having an aperture or entrance towards the ea&s;t, of the width of 12 paces: the rampier ri&s;es about &s;ix perpendicular feet from the level of the interior plain, from the foot of which rampier the plain is near 62 paces diameter. I paced the top of this rampier, and found the whole circle to be near 200 paces. In the interior plain, not ex|actly in the center, but inclining to the &s;outh-we&s;t, is the foundation of a &s;tone wall, forming a &s;quare of equal &s;ides, 14 paces each. This probably was the apartment of the General or other officers, or a &s;tore-hou&s;e for arms and valuable effects. The height from the top of the upper rampier to the next level, is nearly 18 perpendicular feet, and as &s;teep as &s;oil or turf can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to lay. The level here, for it can &s;carce be termed a fo&s;s, the rampier on its edge only forming a brea&s;twork, is nine paces wide. This &s;econd rampier only makes a part of a circle, its points terminating on the brink of a very high pre|cipice overhanging the river: the top of this rampier extends 140 paces. The height from the top of the &s;econd rampier to the next level, is about 15 perpendicular feet, of as &s;teep an a&s;cent as the former. This level or fo&s;s is only &s;ix paces wide, the lowe&s;t or third rampier only forming a brea&s;twork to the interior level; but from the common plain is &s;ix feet in height, compo&s;ed of &s;tones without any mortar; its points al&s;o terminate on the edge of the precipice, and its top mea&s;ures 140 paces: &s;o that the whole mount appears about 34 perpendicular feet high. The form of this fortification renders it probable, that the chief per&s;ons of the army who lay here, with their valuables, were placed on the crown of the eminence, and that the lower trenches were occupied by the troops, according to the nature of their arms; the heavy-armed &s;oldiers in the lower intrenchment; tho&s;e armed with mi&s;&s;ile weapons on the &s;econd and third levels: by which po&s;ition, on an attack, the garri&s;on could fight as from a theatre, &s;tage above &s;tage, and when forced from the lower trenches, could &s;till retreat to a &s;tation of &s;upe|riority. The&s;e are improperly called camps: they &s;eem not calculated for encampment, but as forts for a &s;ecure re&s;ort.</P>

The capital of every pillar that &s;upports the arches of the church and the doors, are all hollowed with a &s;mall tool, being wreathed-work of all &s;orts of flowers, &s;uch as you have at the entrance of your chapter-hou&s;e at York.

<P>The building from the &s;teeple to the ea&s;t end is entire in the walls, but the roof (which has been of &s;tone and carved) is much decayed.</P>
<P>The quire is but &s;mall, but has a noble ea&s;t window, the gla&s;s all out; therein lies a marble &s;tone without any in&s;cription, half a hexagon, tapering &s;maller at the foot, of a bright green colour, and powdered full of white feathers.</P>
<P>The whole &s;tructure is in the form of a St John of Jeru&s;alem's cro&s;s, the north and &s;outh ailes pretty compleat; at the north &s;ide of which is a &s;tair-ca&s;e that has led into the Prior's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From the &s;teeple, we&s;tward, remain &s;ix arches of the nave, in which is the pre&s;ent kirk, that takes up about three of them; but how much further the ancient church has extended, I be|lieve will be hard to know.</P>
<P>In every arch of the nave, both north and &s;outh, has run a cro&s;s wall into the two &s;ide ailes, making &s;o many &s;acella each, with an altar and holy-water pot.</P>
<P>The windows are of an equal dimen&s;ion, but variou&s;ly figured and carved.</P>
<P>The cloi&s;ter has been on the north &s;ide of the church, which opened into a garden, that led to the Tweed, that is there of a good breadth, and there was another garden on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. Our neighbours are not wanting in the faculty of amplifying, but this thing does really exceed all their exaggerations of prai&s;e. By this you'll &s;neer, and &s;ay I have lived too long here, and am become as vain as they; however, I &s;tand to my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>There is printed an upright of this abbey, that is ill done. I could wi&s;h there was not only an exact whole plate, but al&s;o a view of the ea&s;t end, with a di&s;tinct draught of the doors, co|lumns, capitals, and &s;ome of the fine&s;t images, which are &s;o well fini&s;hed to the life, that Dr King of Oxford, who has been lately to &s;ee it, wi&s;hed they were taken down and pre&s;erved from the weather: the whole building is of a fine &s;tone.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h al&s;o, there was an exact Ichnography drawn of the whole. The Mini&s;ter is a good &s;en&s;ible man, a lover of this kind of antiquity, and is daily &s;tudying the walls of this church. He &s;hewed me &s;ome of the gla&s;s of the windows, which is of an uncommon thickne&s;s, not &s;tained through, but painted upon.</P>
<P>If by this mean effort, your &s;ociety could be prevailed upon to take this &s;tructure into their con&s;ideration (I know not how far the Scotch gentlemen are engaged in their Mona&s;ticon Sco|ticum) I have gained my end, e&s;pecially if you will vouch&s;afe me the favour of an an&s;wer to this, who am, dear cou&s;in,</P>

This window is 24 feet in height within the arch, and 16 in breadth; the mouldings of the arch contain many mem|bers, graced with a filleting of foliage; the outward member runs into a point of pinnacle-work, and enclo&s;es a nich highly ornamented, which it is &s;aid contained the figure of our Lord. There are eight niches which &s;ink gradually on the &s;ides of the arch, formerly appropriated to receive the &s;tatues of the Apo&s;tles. The whole &s;outh end ri&s;es to a point to form the roof, garni&s;hed with an upper moulding, which is orna|mented with a fillet of excellent ro&s;e-work: the center is terminated by a &s;quare tower.</P>
<P>It will &s;uffice to remark in this place, that the pede&s;tals for &s;tatues in general, are compo&s;ed of five members of cornice, &s;upported by palm boughs, or &s;ome other rich wrought foliage, and terminating at the foot in a point with a triple roll. The caps or canopies of the niches are compo&s;ed of delicate tabernacle-work, the &s;pires ornamented with mouldings and a fillet of ro&s;e-work, and the &s;u&s;pended &s;kirts graced with flowers: the interior of the canopy is of ribbed-work, terminating in a &s;u&s;pended knot in the center. This de&s;cription will do to carry the reader's idea to every particular nich, without my running into the tediou&s;ne&s;s of repetition.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="323">At the junction of the &s;outh and we&s;t members of the cro&s;s, a hexa|gon tower ari&s;es, terminating in a pinnacle roofed with &s;tone, highly ornamented: from thence the aile is extended &s;o as to receive three large windows, who&s;e arches are pointed, each divided by three up|right bars or mullions, the tracery various and light; &s;ome in wheels, and others in the windings of foliage. The&s;e windows are &s;eparated by buttre&s;&s;es ornamented with niches.

From the feet of the&s;e la&s;t pinnacles, are extended bows or open arches, compo&s;ed of the quarter divi&s;ion of a circle, abutting to the bottoms of another race of buttre&s;&s;es which ari&s;e on the &s;ide wall of the nave; each of the&s;e la&s;t buttre&s;&s;es al&s;o &s;upporting an elegant pinnacle of taber|nacle-work, are ornamented with niches, in two of which &s;tatues re|main; one of St Andrew, the other of the Holy Virgin: the &s;ide ailes are &s;lated, but the nave is covered with an arched roof of hewn &s;tone. From the we&s;t end of the church is continued a row of buildings, con|taining five windows, divided by the like buttre&s;&s;es, the tracery of two of the windows remaining, the re&s;t open. Each of the&s;e windows ap|pertained to a &s;eparate chapel, appropriated and dedicated to di&s;tinct per&s;onages and &s;ervices; the places of the altars, and the fonts or holy-water ba&s;ons &s;till remaining. At the we&s;tern extremity of this &s;tructure, on the la&s;t buttre&s;s, are the arms of Scotland, &s;upported by Unicorns collared and chained; the motto above broken, the letters EGIS only remaining. On one &s;ide is the letter I, on the other Q, and a date 1505, which was the &s;econd year of the marriage of King James IV. a mar|riage concerted at this abbey, between the King in per&s;on, and Richard Fox, then Bi&s;hop of Durham.</P>
<P>In 1649, the fury of reformation &s;till exi&s;ting, the elegant &s;tatues which ornamented this place were mo&s;t &s;acrilegiou&s;ly demoli&s;hed. A tradition prevails here, that one of the per&s;ons &s;o employed, on &s;triking at the babe in the Virgin's arms, received a contu&s;ion, which di&s;abled him for ever from &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s occupation, and &s;truck &s;uch a panic on his a&s;&s;ociates, that they fled and left the mi&s;chievous bu&s;ine&s;s unperfected.</P>
<P>In Spot&s;wood's Hi&s;tory of the Church of Scotland,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 175.</NOTE> we find the&s;e works of fanatical fury thus mentioned: <Q>An act was pa&s;&s;ed for demo|li&s;hing
<PB N="286" REF="324">
cloi&s;ters and abbey churches, &s;uch as were not as yet pulled down; the execution whereof was for the we&s;t parts committed to the Earls of Arrane, Argile, and Glencarn, for the north to Lord James, and for the in-countries to &s;ome Barons that were held mo&s;t zealous.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thereupon i&s;&s;ued a pitiful va&s;tation of churches and church build|ings throughout all the parts of the realm; for every one made bold to put to their hands, the meaner &s;ort imitating the en&s;ample of the greater and tho&s;e who were in authority. No difference was made, but all the churches either defaced or pulled to the ground. The holy ve&s;&s;els, and what&s;oever el&s;e men could make gain of, as timber, lead, and bells were put to &s;ale. The very &s;epulchres of the dead were not &s;pared. The regi&s;ters of the church and biblio|thekes ca&s;t into the fire. I award all was ruined, and what e&s;caped in the time of the fir&s;t tumult, did now undergo the common cala|mity; which was &s;o much the wor&s;e, that the violences committed at this time were coloured with the warrant of public authority. Some ill-advi&s;ed preachers did likewi&s;e animate people, in the&s;e their bar|barous proceedings, crying out, "<HI>that the places where idols had been wor&s;hipped ought by the law of God to be de&s;troyed, and that the &s;paring of them was the re&s;erving of things execrable:</HI> as if the commandment given to I&s;rael, for de&s;troying the place where the Canaanites did wor&s;hip their fal&s;e Gods, had been a warrant for them to do the like. The report al&s;o went, that <HI>John Knox,</HI> who&s;e &s;ayings were by many e&s;teemed as oracles, &s;hould in one of his &s;ermons &s;ay, <HI>that the &s;ure way to bani&s;h the Rooks was to pull down their ne&s;ts:</HI> which words (if any &s;uch did e&s;cape him) were to be under&s;tood of the cloi&s;ters of Monks and Friars only, according to the act pa&s;&s;ed in the council. But popular fury once armed can keep no mea&s;ure, nor do any thing with advice and judgment.</Q></P>
<P>The ea&s;t end of the church is compo&s;ed of the choir, with a &s;mall aile on each &s;ide, which appear to have been open to the high altar. This part is lighted by three windows towards the ea&s;t, and two &s;ide windows in the aile: the center window is divided by four upright bars or mullions, the traceries are of various figures, but chiefly cro&s;&s;es, which &s;upport a large complicated cro&s;s that forms the center; the arching is pointed, and part of the tracery here is broken: the &s;ide lights are near as high as the center, but very narrow, divided by three
<PB N="287" REF="325">
upright bars or mullions: the mouldings of the window arches are &s;mall and delicate, yet ornamented with a fillet of foliage. On each &s;ide of the great window are niches for &s;tatues; and at the top there appear the effigies of an old man &s;itting, with a globe in his left hand re&s;ted on his knee, with a young man on his right: over their heads an open crown is &s;u&s;pended. The&s;e figures, I pre&s;ume, repre&s;ent the di|vine per&s;onages. The buttre&s;&s;es at this end terminate in pinnacles of tabernacle-work: the mouldings and &s;culptures are elegantly wrought.</P>
<P>The north end of the cro&s;s aile of this abbey is not much ornamented without, it having adjoined to the cloi&s;ter and other buildings. The door which leads to the &s;cite of the cloi&s;ter (the building being demo|li&s;hed) is a &s;emicircular arch of many members; the fillet of foliage and flowers, is of the highe&s;t fini&s;hing that can be conceived to be exe|cuted in free-&s;tone; the &s;ame being pierced, the flowers and leaves &s;e|parated from the &s;tone behind, and &s;u&s;pended in a twi&s;ted garland. In the mouldings, pinnacle-work, and foliage of the &s;eats which remain of the cloi&s;ter, I may be bold to &s;ay, there is as great excellence to be found, as in any &s;tone-work in Europe, for lightne&s;s, ea&s;e, and di&s;po|&s;ition. Nature is &s;tudied through the whole, and the flowers and plants are repre&s;ented as accurately as under the pencil. In this fabric there are the fine&s;t le&s;&s;ons, and the greate&s;t variety of Gothic ornaments, that the i&s;land affords, take all the religious &s;tructures together.</P>
<P>The we&s;t &s;ide of the center tower is yet &s;tanding: it appears to have &s;upported a &s;pire; a lo&s;s to the dignity and beauty of the pre&s;ent remains, to be regretted by every vi&s;itant: the balcony-work is beauti|ful, being formed of open ro&s;e-work: the pre&s;ent height of the tower wall is 75 feet.</P>
<P>The length of this edifice from ea&s;t to we&s;t is 258 feet, the cro&s;s aile 137 feet, and the whole contents of its Ichnography 943 feet.</P>
<P>We entered at the &s;outh door, and no expre&s;&s;ion can convey an idea of the &s;olemn magnificence which &s;truck the eye: the roof of the north and &s;outh ends of the tran&s;ept remains, &s;upported by inter&s;ecting groins, in various directions, of the lighte&s;t order; the joinings ornamented with knots, &s;ome &s;culptured with figures, and others of pierced-work in flowers and foliage; the arching of the inter&s;tices con&s;tructed of thin
<PB N="288" REF="326">
&s;tones, clo&s;ely jointed; over the choir, part of the roof of like work|man&s;hip &s;till remains. The &s;ide ailes are formed by light clu&s;tered pil|lars, richly capitalled, with garlands of flowers and foliage di&s;po&s;ed delicately in the mouldings; in &s;ome the figures of animals are inter|&s;per&s;ed. The pillars which &s;upported the tower towards the ea&s;t are gone, &s;o that three &s;ides of it are down, leaving a cha&s;m, through which you look up towards the remaining quarter.</P>
<P>The north aile is lighted by a circular window, repre&s;enting a crown of thorns, which makes an uncommon appearance. Here are the effi|gies of Peter and Paul, one on each &s;ide the tower, but of inferior &s;culpture.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid Alexander II. King of Scotland, lays buried at the high altar, and that an in&s;cription denoted his tomb;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

The Chronicle of Mailro&s;s contains this anecdote: <Q>That Ingerim Bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow and four Abbots came to Mailro&s;s to open the grave, after 12 years interment, when they found the body of Wal|devus uncorrupted: on which, with religious rap&s;ody, they exclaimed, <HI>Vere hic homo Dei e&s;t.</HI></Q> They afterwards placed a marble monument over the remains.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t my companion was drawing his view, I wandered in this hallowed &s;pot till decline of day; the evening advanced with an un|u&s;ual &s;olemnity; the clouds, which were &s;truck with crim&s;on, reflected the beams of the &s;etting &s;un into the interior parts of the building, and made the whole glow with a purple ray: the idea &s;truck me, that ce|le&s;tial mini&s;ters, apparelled &s;uitable to the weakne&s;s of the human eye, accompanied me to walk the ruined aile; the thought was &s;ufficient to in&s;pire a contemplative traveller with meditations as &s;erious as the hu|man mind is &s;u&s;ceptible of. To add to this di&s;po&s;ition, the wind blew a bri&s;k gale, and gave a mournful melody; every object was &s;olemn, and every thought devout; who could forbear exclaiming, <Q>Thy mini&s;ters ince&s;&s;antly accompany us, they involve us as with this ray of light, they penetrate the eye, and read the images of the mind before they have utterance; they bear witne&s;s of our frailties, and rejoice in our virtues; perhaps by &s;o exqui&s;ite a touch that human &s;en&s;e cannot di&s;|tingui&s;h it, they carry on their operations by tho&s;e propen&s;ities for which we are unable to account, and influence our re&s;olves, and &s;truggle with our pronene&s;s to evil, that we may not deviate from thy laws.

The&s;e &s;ad remains of human glory! how are their beauties defaced! thus pa&s;s away the mighty things of the earth! To the eye of him to whom ten thou&s;and years are as one day, what vanity is the magni|ficence of men; here, forgotten of the world, lay in the du&s;t princes and nobles, who&s;e titles, authority, and power, are vani&s;hed as the <HI>ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion.</HI> If &s;pirits vi&s;it their terre&s;trial abodes, for <HI>it is not the will of</HI> our <HI>father which is in heaven that one of the&s;e &s;hould peri&s;h,</HI> here perhaps wander heroes, who langui&s;h over their unex|piated crimes; men of religious orders, who mourn the depravity of the human race, and the de&s;olation of their temple, where once all human energy was breathed in prayer. If &s;pirits vi&s;it their terre&s;trial walks, and leave for a time that ineffable beatitude proclaimed to us, <HI>that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of</HI> our <HI>father which is in heaven</HI>&mdash;perhaps&mdash;alas, it is too true! I lo&s;t a friend! perhaps his expanded e&s;&s;ence fills this ray, that penetrates the gloom, rejoices in the thoughts which ri&s;e upon my mind, conveys my prayer to the divine propitiatory, prompts each virtuous fervour, and &s;ubverts all ri&s;ing impropriety: perhaps, with that pure affection which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed when living on earth, he looks upon my countenance, commi|&s;erates the darkne&s;s of my faculties, that here are labouring for plea|&s;ure or for knowledge!</Q></P>
<P>My eyes grew full of tears, my heart heaved in tumult, my hands were gra&s;ped through energy of thought, and I &s;tood as a &s;tatue, when the approaching foot of my companion rou&s;ed me, pre&s;erving my mind from a growing extravagance of imagination, which was already re|plete with the mo&s;t affecting images.</P>
<P>In the morning, at &s;un-ri&s;e, we again returned to the&s;e &s;plendid ruins, which had even occupied the vi&s;ions of our &s;leep; we yet had to take a &s;urvey of the nave of the church, which is now u&s;ed for wor|&s;hip. On opening the door, it is not to be expre&s;&s;ed, the di&s;agreeable &s;cene which pre&s;ented it&s;elf; this place is filled with &s;talls, in the di&s;po|&s;ition of which, irregularity alone &s;eems to have been &s;tudied: &s;ome

are rai&s;ed on upright beams, as &s;caffolds, tier above tier; others &s;up|ported again&s;t the walls and pillars: no two are alike in form, height, or magnitude; the &s;ame confu&s;ion of little and great, high and low, covers the floor with pews: the lights are &s;o ob&s;tructed, that the place is as dark as a vault; the floor is nothing but the damp earth; na&s;tine&s;s and irregularity po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole &s;cene. The fine workman&s;hip of the pillars, who&s;e capitals, for flowers and foliage, exceed all the re&s;t of the building, the ribs of the arches, and the ornaments of their inter&s;ec|tions, are &s;carce to be &s;een in the horrid gloom which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the place.</P>
<P>What idea, concomitant to religion, can dictate filthine&s;s and con|fu&s;ion in a hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, I know not: by magnificence and &s;plen|dour the eye may be diverted; but in that elegant &s;implicity, in which cleanne&s;s and plainne&s;s are a&s;&s;ociates, the mind ab&s;tracted from atten|tion to worldly things, will be yielded to uninterrupted devotion. All reformation has been attended with extravagance; bigotry grows up into pa&s;&s;ion, and from one extreme the zealot ru&s;hes into another. When the pomp of Romi&s;h wor&s;hip was to be corrected, the Scotch &s;unk into the deepe&s;t rever&s;e. Many of the old churches in Scotland, which I have &s;een, are filthy and foul; one of the allotments of the Cathedral of St Andrews, in the city of Gla&s;gow, appropriated to parochial duty, is even in the burial vaults, in the foundation of the &s;tructure, without light, but what i&s;&s;ues through little loop-holes near to the pulpit, where the mini&s;ter &s;its to teach his pari&s;hioners, who are lodged in outer dark|ne&s;s; but for uncleanne&s;s and irregularity this place exceeds them all. I have had dreams of confu&s;ion in my youth, but never formed even a di&s;ea&s;ed idea like this. It looks like the hou&s;e of lunatics, it is unpa|rallelled, and defies all language to give it a de&s;cription; &s;uperior to every thing but the incongruities of a Bedlamite's di&s;ordered fancy.</P>
<P>But to more moderate matters: Here are &s;everal tombs of eminent per&s;onages; on the north wall is in&s;cribed, under a coat armour, <Q>Here lies the race of the hou&s;e of Zair.</Q> Many altars, ba&s;ons for holy water, and other remains of &s;eparate chapels appear in the ailes, among which are tho&s;e of St Mary and St Waldave.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments which aro&s;e to me, whil&s;t I walked or rather &s;taggered about in this &s;trange &s;cene, were much to this effect: I premi&s;ed that true Religion con&s;i&s;ted of that devout fervour of mind, which gives its
<PB N="292" REF="330">
ideas to the Divinity, full of gratitude for his benevolence and long-&s;ufferings, full of admiration of that maje&s;ty and mightine&s;s which are di&s;played through all his works; and from a true con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of man's demerits and the imperfections of his judgment, full of patience, hu|mility, and re&s;ignation. When a man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;po&s;i|tion of mind puts up a prayer, it is only for mercy and protection. In whatever cla&s;s of religious men we find the&s;e premi&s;ed principles be&s;t pre&s;erved, we may determine with ju&s;tice, that there the true devotee is di&s;tingui&s;hed. Modes of religion are its corruption; the acceptations of a country, or the pre&s;criptions of a peculiar &s;et of men, may be &s;a|lutary to the community in general, but in no wi&s;e conducive to the de|votion of the individual. Religion has its e&s;&s;ence from the liberty of the mind; formularies, maxims, modes, or dictions, are di&s;gui&s;es which in the robe confound the &s;pirit; are fetters that bind down the fervour of the mind. If the truly devout heart breathe out, "Lord have mercy on me a &s;inner," there is more religion in that &s;hort &s;entence &s;o uttered, than in ten thou&s;and Ave Marys, a million of liturgies, and the frip|pery of e&s;tabli&s;hment. Charity is as unbounded as the regions of hea|ven, and be&s;et with as many gems as the galaxy. Charity &s;ays, the truly religious of every age, nation, cu&s;tom, profe&s;&s;ion, and mode, are acceptable to the Divinity; for it is not the mode, but the &s;pirit that approacheth the regions of life. When I tread the walk of antiquity, I venerate the pious works of the heathen: the &s;ervant of the Deity is to be revered, let his &s;ervice differ never &s;o wide from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which I am a member: it is the e&s;&s;ence of the act, that I &s;ever from the defilements of cu&s;tom: we judge, and may be judged; we think we are right; &s;o did the Ancients: the Druid, the Amonian, in his acts of piety, is to be regarded without the errors of his &s;un&s;hine &s;ervices; he wor&s;hipped the Deity, under the &s;ymbol of the &s;un; an object in nature the mo&s;t rea&s;onably adopted as the image of the Creator, or as the throne of his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Roman &s;cattering &s;alt and meal on the crackling coals, and making his libations to the Divinity under the type of &s;ome of his at|tributes, is al&s;o worthy of our reverence: the errors his modes admit|ted, through charity are exempt from judgment, and his real piety is e&s;timated, dive&s;ted of defilements which were contracted from the errors of the age.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="331">The Jewi&s;h pomp and ceremony, the tumultuous and noi&s;y &s;acrifice, the grea&s;y &s;ervices, and blood-be&s;pattered altars, are all forgotten, when we trace the religion of the mind, and the piety of the devotee.</P>
<P>The magnificent rites of modern Rome loo&s;e their pageantry, and &s;ink upon our e&s;timate, when we compare them to the cell of humilia|tion; where piety, leaving the eye of men, retires to &s;olitudes, and the Reclu&s;e confe&s;&s;ing the frailties of nature, with purity of &s;oul a|vows all the religious confidence of faith; we at once turn from the echoing dome, and the acclamations of a choir of eunuchs, to &s;eek this holy devotee, the man who communes &s;ecretly with his own &s;oul; who puts off the formulary, and pre&s;ents, in his &s;olitary cell, a genuine confe&s;&s;ion and the &s;pirit of prayer before his God, who&s;e pre&s;ence is univer&s;al.</P>
<P>The Reformi&s;t, prote&s;ting again&s;t the errors of others, like the &s;crip|tural image of imperfection, plucks not the beam from his own eye; though le&s;s pompous in his &s;ervice, yet he remains as ceremonious;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our reformed church of England has retained too much of the Popi&s;h &s;pirit and cu&s;tom, which tends to the de&s;truction of rational piety and true chri&s;tian wor&s;hip.

When many &s;uppo&s;ed Mediators were to be addre&s;&s;ed, repetition was attended with &s;ome rea&s;on: the&s;e are taken away, but the reiteration continues.

conceives what the Divinity accepts, though unuttered by the lips. The Fanatic would in the utmo&s;t agitation be in action, the Bramin be in torture, but this Religious brings offerings of peace; his God is the God of tranquillity.

<P>The canting Hypocrite, who goes about announcing wretchedne&s;s, and breathing anathemas on mankind, is to be treated with pity and an apothecary.</P>
<P>Religion is replete with plea&s;ures, and not burthened with terrors; &s;he bringeth forth the mo&s;t placid hope, and her hope is accompanied with inexhau&s;tible images of joy. Pope's di&s;tich, as to modes of faith, is infallibly true:

This was the &s;cite of the ancient abbey of Culdees, mentioned by Bede to have exi&s;ted in 664, in the reign of the Saxon O&s;wy.

<P>The Scotch who are ambitious of antiquity, attribute it to Columbus; &s;ome more moderate, &s;ay its original patron was Aidan. Bede &s;ays it was &s;eated on the banks of Tweed; that the churches at that time were built of oak, thatched with reeds; and that the religious of this hou&s;e maintained them&s;elves a long time again&s;t the canons and ordinances of the Romi&s;h councils. On a penin&s;ula formed by the river, you are &s;hewn the &s;cite of old Mailro&s;s, with the foundations of the wall, the porter's lodge, the chapel know, and many other places appertaining to that hou&s;e; together with the remains of a bridge over Tweed. Nen|nius, who lived as &s;ome authors a&s;&s;ert in 620, but according to others in 853, &s;peaks of this mona&s;tery as a place of great note; and probably it was de&s;troyed by the Danes when they ravaged this country. Bede gives the names of &s;ome Abbots here; <HI>Eata</HI> the fir&s;t: he was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Boi&s;il,</HI> who according to Demp&s;ter died in 643: <HI>St Cuthbert</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Boi&s;il,</HI> but afterwards quitted this mona&s;tery, and went to <HI>Lindisfarne:</HI> he was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Etholwold.</HI> This is all I can collect of old Mail|ro&s;s. The hou&s;e of which the&s;e celebrated ruins are the remains, was founded by David King of Scotland in the year 1136: it was endowed with large revenues and many immunities, as appears by the charters granted to the Abbot and Convent by the Kings of Scotland. In a manu&s;cript &s;aid to be depo&s;ited in the Colbertine Library, giving an account of the &s;everal religious hou&s;es founded by King David, it is mentioned, <HI>Sed Melro&s;&s;en&s;um praecipue inter omnes eccle&s;ias &amp; fideliter defen|&s;abat &amp; dulciter diligebat &amp; &s;uis opibus exornabat.</HI> Mr Hay &s;ays it is re|corded in the book of taxes of the Apo&s;tolic Chamber, that King David be&s;towed thereon 1880 florins. The original charter of foundation was
<PB N="296" REF="334">
confirmed by his &s;on Prince Henry, and intimates that he gave to this abbey the whole lands of Mailro&s;s, Eldun of Dernewie, Galtown&s;ide, Galtown&s;ide Haugh, and Galtown&s;ide Wood, and many privileges in the fore&s;ts of Selkirk and Traquair; particularly betwixt Galla and Leeder. The charter al&s;o expre&s;&s;es, that the&s;e lands had been peram|bulated by the King in per&s;on, accompanied by Prince Henry, with Richard the fir&s;t Abbot. The date of this charter is the &s;econd year after Stephen of Boloign, King of England, was taken pri&s;oner, which mu&s;t be in the year 1143. The witne&s;&s;es are Hogo de Moreville, Wil|liam de Somerville, Gerva&s;us Riddel, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The date of the foundation appears in this monki&s;h di&s;tich:
<Q><L>"Anno Milleno centeno terquoque deno</L>
<L>"Et &s;exto Chri&s;ti, Melro&s;e fundita fui&s;ti."</L></Q>
By the foundation charter the dedication appears to be <HI>Deo &amp; &s;anctae Mariae de Mailro&s;s &amp; Monachis ibidem deo &s;ervientibus de Riavallis, &amp;c.</HI> of the Ci&s;tercian order; yet the church was not dedicated till the year 1146.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t Abbot was in&s;talled in the year 1136, the year of foundation: he was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Walterus</HI> or <HI>Waldevus,</HI> a &s;on of King David, who was afterwards elected Bi&s;hop of St Andrews, but refu&s;ed Epi&s;copacy. To him many miracles were attributed; to relate one will &s;uffice:&mdash;<Q>In a great famine, about 4000 poor people came to the con|vent of Mailro&s;s for relief, whom Waldeve the Abbot pitying, he went with his cellarer or butler Tyna to his grange at Heldwii, and then to Gatton&s;ide, and having put in the &s;taff which he carried in his hand among the corn, it was increa&s;ed through the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, both for the &s;upply of the convent and all the&s;e numerous poor.</Q> He received canonization, and many rich offerings were made at his tomb.</P>
<P>Joceline, a man of great learning, was Abbot here; he was after|wards made Bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, but cho&s;e Mailro&s;s for the place of his interment. One Laurentius was a &s;ucceeding Abbot; al&s;o Ranulph, in 1194, who by the Legate of Pope Innocent III. was made Bi&s;hop of Down, in Ireland.</P>
<P>We find this mona&s;tery, like all others, very bu&s;y and warm in &s;e|cular matters. The pious Legate was at Mailro&s;s to determine a di&s;|pute between this Abbey and Calehow, and to his di&s;honour, it is &s;aid, he
<PB N="297" REF="335">
took the fee of office, and left the ca&s;e undetermined: and in 1268 the Abbot and a great many of the &s;ociety and dependents of this mona&s;tery, were excommunicated by a Council held at Perth, for an affray with the men of Wedale, in which a Clergyman was &s;lain, and many per&s;ons wounded.</P>
<P>In 1206, William the 9th Abbot of Mailro&s;s died. This was the 48th year after the death of St Waldeve. William was equally e&s;teemed for his &s;anctity, and on his death it was re&s;olved that their bodies &s;hould be laid together. As the workmen were preparing William's grave, brother Robert, who was a Ma&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Lay Brother.</NOTE> by the incitement of &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates, but not without reluctance and much religious horror, rai&s;ed the cover of Waldeve's tomb, when there i&s;&s;ued a fragrance, as if the grave had been filled with &s;pices. Being in the gloom of the evening, he brought a candle to the aperture; all who were pre&s;ent beheld the &s;acred body entire, and all the ve&s;tments as fre&s;h and beautiful as when fir&s;t put on. There were &s;ix Monks and as many Lay-brothers, who had the happine&s;s of gratifying their pious though pre&s;umptuous cu|rio&s;ity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fordun, l. 8. c. 66.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 1240, the bones of the Abbots of Mailro&s;s, that lay in the entrance of the chapter-hou&s;e, were taken up, and more decently buried in the ea&s;tern part of the &s;ame chapter-hou&s;e, all excepting the bones of St Waldeve, who&s;e &s;epulchre was opened, and his body found at la&s;t crumbled into du&s;t. Tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent carried off &s;ome of the &s;mall bones, leaving the re&s;t to repo&s;e in peace.

<P>This mona&s;tery &s;uffered many injuries in the wars between Scotland and England. In the year 1322, it was pillaged by the troops of King Edward II. who&s;e inglorious expedition was marked with di&s;grace, by the burning this and Dryburgh Abbey, and murdering a company of Monks. King Robert Bruce, for its re&s;toration, gave, in the year 1326, 2000l. &s;terling, with many forfeited e&s;tates. King Richard II. again burnt this mona&s;tery, and in the reign of King Henry VIII. it was pil|laged and laid wa&s;te. Sir Ralph Ivers and Sir Bryan Layton having obtained a grant of Mer&s;e and Tiviotdale, on their coming to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, were oppo&s;ed by Archibald the 7th Earl of Angus, at Ancrum Moor, and &s;uffered a &s;hameful defeat. The ground where this battle was fought is called Lilliards Edge, from the &s;ingular valour of a woman who was on the &s;ide of the Scotch. Over her place of interment was erected a monument, with this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this &s;tane,</L>
<L>Little was her &s;tature, but great her fame;</L>

<P>Mailro&s;s was a mother church to all of the Ci&s;tercian order in Scot|land. The Monks wrote a chronicle of this hou&s;e, beginning at 735, and continued down to 1270.

The place hath not the form or appearance of a Roman camp; it has been an occa&s;ional for|tification, not a permanent one: the climate and expo&s;ure of the &s;ituation will not allow a conjecture that it was de&s;igned for a continued &s;trong-hold.
