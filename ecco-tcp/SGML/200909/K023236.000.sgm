<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the&s;e days of infidelity, when it is to be apprehended, that the athei&s;tical doctrines of a neighbouring country are extending them&s;elves in this, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of &s;everal pious laymen, as well as exemplary divines; a friend to religion has great plea&s;ure in being able to lay before the public a di&s;cour&s;e to prove the exi&s;tence of a God, pronounced in a &s;ociety of friends, who meet together at &s;tated times, for the purpo&s;e of forwarding philo&s;ophical truth, and of repelling the flippant wittici&s;ms of the pre|&s;ent day, whenever directed again&s;t this grand truth.</P>
<P>Under whatever form of religious ceremony the Supreme Being may be wor&s;hipped, that he
<PB N="iv" REF="3">exi&s;ts mu&s;t be a matter of previous conviction. The &s;ociety being impre&s;&s;ed with a belief of his exi&s;tence, it became one of their fir&s;t objects to prove the fact. It is conceived that this is done in the following production, in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly and philo&s;ophical manner. And it is pre&s;umed that, whether the novelty of the axiom, the mathematical deduction to a con|clu&s;ive proof, the acutene&s;s of the rea&s;oning, the learning di&s;played, or the &s;implicity of the &s;tyle be con&s;idered, there is nothing in ancient or modern learning, from the wi&s;dom of Plato to the &s;yllogi&s;m of Clarke, that has &s;o &s;atisfac|torily proved the exi&s;tence of a God. Under this impre&s;&s;ion it has been thought advi&s;able to prevent its being confined to the limited circle of a private &s;ociety, and to give it as exten&s;ive a circulation as its merit will un|doubtedly &s;ecure it. Happy will the &s;ociety deem it&s;elf if it tend to recal one erring, or even to fix one doubting mind.</P>

<HEAD>ATHEISM REFUTED.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION has two principal enemies, Fanatici&s;m and Infidelity, or that which is called Athei&s;m. The fir&s;t requires to be combated by rea&s;on and morality, the other by natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a God is the fir&s;t dogma of religious wor&s;hip. It is upon this &s;ubject that I &s;olicit your at|tention: for though it has been often treated of, and that mo&s;t &s;ublimely, the &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible; and there will always remain &s;omething to be &s;aid that has not been before advanced. I go therefore to open the &s;ubject, and to crave your attention to the end.</P>
<P>The univer&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts the creed of a philo&s;opher. It is there that he reads of God. It is there that the
<PB N="6" REF="5">proofs of his exi&s;tence are to be &s;ought and to be found. The &s;ceptic may deny the divine authority of the in|&s;pired writings, may a&s;&s;ert that they are the works of man's hands, and that they carry no evidence in them|&s;elves that God is the author of them. To him we hold out this univer&s;e as a thing that man could not make; to him we propo&s;e it as the evidence for his be|lief, as the inimitable word of God.</P>
<P>Contemplating the univer&s;e, the whole &s;y&s;tem of creation, in this point of light, we &s;hall di&s;cover, that all that which is called natural philo&s;ophy is properly a divine &s;tudy&mdash;It is the &s;tudy of God through his works&mdash;It is the be&s;t &s;tudy, by which we can arrive at a knowledge of his exi&s;tence, and the only one by which we can gain a glimp&s;e of his perfection.</P>
<P>Do we want to contemplate his power? we &s;ee it in the immen&s;ity of the Creation. Do we want to con|template his wi&s;dom? We &s;ee it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehen&s;ible WHOLE is govern|ed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We &s;ee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We &s;ee it in his not withholding that abundance even from the un|thankful.
<PB N="7" REF="6">In fine, do we want to know what God is? Let us &s;earch the creation.</P>
<P>It has been the error of the &s;chools to teach a&s;trono|my, and all the other &s;ciences, and &s;ubjects of natural philo&s;ophy, as accompli&s;hments only; whereas they &s;hould be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them; for all the principles of &s;cience are of Divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or contrive principles. He can only di&s;cover them; and he ought to look through the di&s;covery to the Author.</P>
<P>When we examine an extraordinary piece of ma|chinery, an a&s;toni&s;hing pile of architecture, a well exe|cuted &s;tatue, or an highly fini&s;hed painting, where life and action are imitated, and habit only prevents our mi&s;taking a &s;urface of light and &s;hade for cubical &s;olidity, our ideas are naturally led to think of the exten&s;ive genius and talents of the arti&s;t. When we &s;tudy the ele|ments of geometry, we think of Euclid. When we &s;peak of gravitation, we think of Newton. How then is it, that when we &s;tudy the works of God in the Crea|tion, we &s;top &s;hort and do not think of God? It is from the error of the &s;chools in having taught tho&s;e &s;ub|jects as accompli&s;hments only, and thereby &s;eparated
<PB N="8" REF="7">the &s;tudy of them from the Being who is the author of them.</P>
<P>The &s;chools have made the &s;tudy of theology to con|&s;i&s;t in the &s;tudy of opinions in written or printed books; whereas theology &s;hould be &s;tudied in the works or book of the creation. The &s;tudy of theology in books of opinions has often produced fanatici&s;m, rancour, and cruelty of temper; and from hence have proceeded the numerous per&s;ecutions, the fanatical quarrels, the reli|gious burnings and ma&s;&s;acres, that have de&s;olated Eu|rope. But the &s;tudy of theology in the works of the creation produces a directly contrary effect. The mind becomes at once enlightened and &s;erene; a copy of the &s;cene it beholds; information and adoration go hand in hand; and all the &s;ocial faculties become enlarged.</P>
<P>The evil that has re&s;ulted from the error of the &s;chools, in teaching natural philo&s;ophy as an accom|pli&s;hment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a &s;pecies of Athei&s;m. In&s;tead of looking through the works of Creation to the Creator him&s;elf, they &s;top &s;hort, and employ the knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his exi&s;tence. They labour, with &s;tudied in|genuity, to a&s;cribe every thing they behold to innate properties of matter; and jump over all the re&s;t by &s;aying, that matter is eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">Let us examine this &s;ubject; it is worth examining; for if we examine it through all its ca&s;es, the re&s;ult will be, that the exi&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, will be di&s;coverable by philo&s;ophical principles.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, admitting matter to have proper|ties, as we &s;ee it has, the que&s;tion &s;till remains, how came matter by tho&s;e properties? To this they will an&s;wer, that matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e properties eternally. This is not &s;olution, but a&s;&s;ertion; and to deny it is equally as impo&s;&s;ible of proof as to a&s;&s;ert it. It is then nece&s;&s;ary to go further, and therefore I &s;ay,&mdash;if there exi&s;t a circum&s;tance that is <HI>not</HI> a property of matter, and without which the univer&s;e, or to &s;peak in a limited de|gree, the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, compo&s;ed of planets and a &s;un, could not exi&s;t a moment; all the arguments of Athei&s;m, drawn from properties of matter, and applied to ac|count for the univer&s;e, will be overthrown; and the ex|i&s;tence of a &s;uperior cau&s;e, or that which man calls God, becomes di&s;coverable, as is before &s;aid, by natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>I go now to &s;hew that &s;uch a circum&s;tance exi&s;ts, and what it is:</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">The univer&s;e is compo&s;ed of matter, and, as a &s;y&s;tem, is &s;u&s;tained by motion. Motion is <HI>not a property</HI> of mat|ter, and without this motion the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem could not exi&s;t. Were motion a property of matter, that undi&s;|covered and undi&s;coverable thing called perpetual mo|tion would e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf. It is becau&s;e motion is not a property of matter, that perpetual motion is an impo&s;&s;i|bility in the hand of every being but that of the Creator of motion. When the pretenders to Athei&s;m can pro|duce perpetual motion, and not till then, they may ex|pect to be credited.</P>
<P>The natural &s;tate of matter, as to place, is a &s;tate of re&s;t. Motion, or change of place, is the effect of an external cau&s;e acting upon matter. As to that faculty of matter that is called gravitation, it is the influence which two or more bodies have reciprocally on each other to unite and be at re&s;t. Every thing which has hitherto been di&s;covered with re&s;pect to the motion of the planets in the &s;y&s;tem, relates only to the laws by which motion acts, and not to the cau&s;e of motion. Gravitation, &s;o far from being the cau&s;e of motion to the planets that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, would be the de&s;truction of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, were revolutionary mo|tion to cea&s;e; for as the action of &s;pinning upholds a top, the revolutionary motion upholds the planets in
<PB N="11" REF="10">their orbits, and prevents them from gravitating and forming one ma&s;s with the &s;un. In one &s;en&s;e of the word, philo&s;ophy knows, and athei&s;m &s;ays, that matter is in perpetual motion. But the motion here meant re|fers to the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of matter, and that only on the &s;urface of the earth. It is either decompo&s;ition, which is con|tinually de&s;troying the form of bodies of matter, or re|compo&s;ition, which renews that matter in the &s;ame or another form, as the decompo&s;ition of animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances enters into the compo&s;ition of other bodies. But the motion that upholds the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem is of an entire different kind, and is not a property of matter. It ope|rates al&s;o to an entire different effect. It operates to <HI>perpetual pre&s;ervation,</HI> and to prevent <HI>any change</HI> in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Giving then to matter all the properties which phi|lo&s;ophy knows it has, or all that athei&s;m a&s;cribes to it, and can prove, and even &s;uppo&s;ing matter to be eternal, it will not account for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e or of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, becau&s;e it will not account for motion, and it is motion that pre&s;erves it. When, therefore, we di&s;cover a circum&s;tance of &s;uch immen&s;e importance, that without it the univer&s;e could not exi&s;t, and for which neither matter, nor any, nor all, the properties of matter can account; we are by nece&s;&s;ity forced into the rational and comfortable belief of the exi&s;tence of a
<PB N="12" REF="11">cau&s;e &s;uperior to matter, and that cau&s;e man calls GOD.</P>
<P>As to that which is called nature, it is no other than the laws by which motion and action of every kind, with re&s;pect to unintelligible matter, is regulated. And when we &s;peak of looking through nature up to nature's God, we &s;peak philo&s;ophically the &s;ame rational lan|guage as when we &s;peak of looking through human laws up to the power that ordained them.</P>
<P>God is the power or fir&s;t cau&s;e, nature is the law, and matter is the &s;ubject acted upon.</P>
<P>But infidelity by a&s;cribing every phenomenon to pro|perties of matter, conceives a &s;y&s;tem for which it can|not account, and yet it pretends to demon&s;tration. It rea&s;ons from what it &s;ees on the &s;urface of the earth, but it does not carry it&s;elf on to the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ting by motion. It &s;ees upon the &s;urface a perpetual de|compo&s;ition and recompo&s;ition of matter. It &s;ees that an oak produces an acorn, an acorn an oak, a bird an egg, an egg a bird, and &s;o on. In things of this kind it &s;ees &s;omething which it calls a natural cau&s;e, but none of the cau&s;es it &s;ees is the cau&s;e of that motion which pre&s;erves the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">Let us contemplate this wonderful and &s;tupendous &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ting of matter and exi&s;ting by motion. It is not matter in a &s;tate of re&s;t, nor in a &s;tate of decom|po&s;ition or recompo&s;ition. It is matter &s;y&s;tematized in perpetual orbicular or circular motion. As a &s;y&s;tem that motion is the life of it: as animation is life to an animal body; deprive the &s;y&s;tem of motion, and, as a &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t expire. Who then breathed into the &s;y&s;tem the life of motion? What power impelled the planets to move &s;ince motion is not a property of the matter of which they are compo&s;ed? If we contemplate the immen&s;e velocity of this motion, our wonder be|comes increa&s;ed, and our adoration enlarges it&s;elf in the &s;ame proportion. To in&s;tance only one of the planets, that of the earth we inhabit, its di&s;tance from the &s;un, the center of the orbits of all the planets, is, according to ob&s;ervations of the tran&s;it of the planet Venus, about one hundred million of miles; con&s;equently the diameter of the orbit or circle in which the earth moves round the &s;un is double that di&s;tance; and the mea&s;ure of the circumference of the orbit, taken as three times its dia|meter, is &s;ix hundred million of miles. The earth per|forms this voyage in three hundred and &s;ixty-five days and &s;ome hours, and con&s;equently moves at the rate of more than one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and miles every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">Where will infidelity, where will athei&s;m, find cau&s;e for this a&s;toni&s;hing velocity of motion, never cea&s;ing, never varying, and which is the pre&s;ervation of the earth in its orbit? It is not by rea&s;oning from an acorn to an oak, from an egg to a bird, or from any change in the &s;tate of matter on the &s;urface of the earth, that this can be accounted for. Its cau&s;e is not to be found in matter, nor in any thing we call nature. The athei&s;t who affects to rea&s;on, and the fanatic who rejects rea&s;on, plunge them&s;elves alike into inextricable diffi|culties. The one perverts the &s;ublime and enlightening &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy into a deformity of ab|&s;urdities by not rea&s;oning to the end; the other lo&s;es him&s;elf in the ob&s;curity of metaphy&s;ical theories, and di&s;honours the Creator by treating the &s;tudy of his works with contempt. The one is a half-rational of whom there is &s;ome hope, the other a vi&s;ionary to whom we mu&s;t be charitable.</P>
<P>When at fir&s;t we think of a Creator, our ideas appear to us undefined and confu&s;ed; but if we rea|&s;on philo&s;ophically, tho&s;e ideas can be ea&s;ily arranged and &s;implified. <HI>It is a Being who&s;e power is equal to his will.</HI> Ob&s;erve the nature of the will of man. It is of an infinite quality. We cannot conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of limits to the will. Ob&s;erve, on the other hand, how
<PB N="15" REF="14">exceedingly limited is his power of acting compared with the nature of his will. Suppo&s;e the power equal to the will, and man would be a God. He would will him&s;elf eternal, and be &s;o. He could will a creation and could make it. In this progre&s;&s;ive rea&s;oning, we &s;ee, in the nature of the will of man, half of that which we conceive in thinking of God, add the other half and we have the whole idea of a being who could make the univer&s;e, and &s;u&s;tain it by perpetual motion, becau&s;e he could create that motion.</P>
<P>We know nothing of the capacity of the will of animals; but we know a great deal of the difference of their powers. For example, how numerous are their degrees, and how immen&s;e is the difference of power, from a mite to a man. Since then every thing we &s;ee below us is a progre&s;&s;ion of power, where is the difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing that there is at the <HI>&s;ummit of all things</HI> a Being in whom an infinity of power unites with the infinity of will? When this &s;imple idea pre&s;ents it|&s;elf to our mind we have the idea of a perfect being that man calls God.</P>
<P>It is comfortable to live under the belief of the ex|i&s;tence of an infinitely protecting power; and it is an addition to that comfort to know, that &s;uch a belief is
<PB N="16" REF="15">not a mere conceit of the imagination, as many of the theories that are called religious are; nor a belief founded only on tradition or received opinion, but is a belief deducible by the action of rea&s;on upon the things that compo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; a belief ari&s;ing out of vi&s;ible facts, and &s;o demon&s;trable is the truth of this belief, that if no &s;uch belief had exi&s;ted the per&s;ons who now controvert it, would have been the per&s;ons who would have produced and propagated it; becau&s;e, by beginning to rea&s;on, they would have been led on to rea&s;on progre&s;&s;ively to the end, and thereby have di&s;|covered that matter and all the properties it has, will not account for the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a &s;uperior cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the exce&s;s to which imaginary &s;y&s;tems of religion had been carried, and the intolerance, per&s;ecu|tions, burnings, and ma&s;&s;acres, they occa&s;ioned, that fir&s;t induced certain per&s;ons to propagate infidelity; thinking, that upon the whole, it was better not to believe at all, than to believe a multitude of things and complicated creeds, that occa&s;ioned &s;o much mi&s;chief in the world. But tho&s;e days are pa&s;t; per&s;ecution has cea&s;ed, and the antidote then &s;et up again&s;t it has no longer even the &s;hadow of apology. We profe&s;s, and we proclaim in peace, the pure, unmixed, comfortable, and rational
<PB N="17" REF="16">belief of a God, as manife&s;ted to us in the univer&s;e. We do this without any apprehen&s;ion of that belief being made a cau&s;e of per&s;ecution as other beliefs have been, or of &s;uffering per&s;ecution our&s;elves. To God, and not to man, are all men to account for their belief.</P>
<P>It has been well ob&s;erved at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of this &s;ociety, that the opinions which form the ba&s;is of its belief have been held from the commencement of the world; that they are not novelties, but are confe&s;&s;edly the ba&s;is of all &s;y&s;tems of religion, however numerous and contradictory they may be. All men in the out&s;et of the religion they profe&s;s are adorers of a God, and friends of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ociety, in their enquiry after Truth, re&s;orted to fir&s;t prin|ciples, and took, as the foundation of their future &s;uper&s;tructure, that innate propen&s;itity of man wherever exi&s;ting to the adoration of a God, and the love of his fellow-creatures.</NOTE>. It is impo&s;&s;ible to form any &s;y&s;tem of religion without building upon the&s;e principles, and therefore they are not &s;ectarian principles, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ect compo&s;ed of all the world.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in the cour&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e, that the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy is a divine &s;tudy, becau&s;e it is the &s;tudy of the works of God in the Creation. If we con&s;ider theology upon this ground, what an exten|&s;ive
<PB N="18" REF="17">field of improvement in things both divine and hu|man opens it&s;elf before us! All the principles of &s;cience are of divine origin. It was not man that invented the principles on which a&s;tronomy, and every branch of ma|thematics are founded and &s;tudied. It was not man that gave properties to the circle and the triangle. Tho&s;e principles are eternal and immutable. We &s;ee in them the unchangeable nature of the Divinity. We &s;ee in them immortality, an immortality exi&s;ting after the ma|terial figures that expre&s;s tho&s;e properties are di&s;&s;olved in du&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety is at pre&s;ent in its in&s;ancy, and its means are &s;mall; but I wi&s;h to hold in view the &s;ubject I allude to, and in&s;tead of teaching the philo&s;ophical branches of learning as ornamental accompli&s;hments only, as they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that &s;hall combine theological knowledge with &s;cientific in&s;truction; to do this to the be&s;t advantage, &s;ome in&s;truments will be nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of explanation, of which the &s;ociety is not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But as the views of the &s;ociety extend to public good, as well as to that of the individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be devi&s;ed to procure them.</P>
<P>If we unite to the pre&s;ent in&s;truction, a &s;eries of lec|tures
<PB N="19" REF="18">on the ground I have mentioned, we &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, render theology the mo&s;t delightful, and en|tertaining of all &s;tudies. In the next place, we &s;hall give &s;cientific in&s;truction to tho&s;e who could not other|wi&s;e obtain it. The mechanic of every profe&s;&s;ion will there be taught the mathematical principles nece&s;&s;ary to render him a proficient in his art. The cultivator will there &s;ee developed the principles of vegetation; while, at the &s;ame time, they will be led to &s;ee the hand of God in all the&s;e things.</P>
