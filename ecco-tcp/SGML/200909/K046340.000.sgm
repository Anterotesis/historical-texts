<P>_I Wi&s;h I could have brought this Play upon the Stage with le&s;s Violence to its Author, and not &s;o much Re&s;pon|&s;ibility on my own Part. New cha|racters of nece&s;&s;ity require &s;ome di&s;|play. Many original pa&s;&s;ages of the fir&s;t merit are &s;till retained, and in the contemplation of them, my errors, I hope, will be overlooked or forgiven; In examining the Bril|liancy of a Diamond, few people throw away any Remarks upon the dullne&s;s of the foil.</P>
